H emostasis is the process that maintains the integrity of a closed , high - pressure circulatory system after vascular damage . Vessel - wall injury and the extravasation of blood from the circulation rapidly initiate events in the vessel wall and in blood that seal the breach . Circulating platelets are recruited to the site of injury , where they become a major component of the develop - ing thrombus ; blood coagulation , initiated by tissue factor , culminates in the genera - tion of thrombin and fibrin . These events occur concomitantly ( Fig . 1A ; also see Video , available with the full text of this article at www . nejm . org ) , and under nor - mal conditions , regulatory mechanisms contain thrombus formation temporally and spatially . When pathologic processes overwhelm the regulatory mechanisms of hemo - stasis , excessive quantities of thrombin form , initiating thrombosis ( Fig . 1B ; and Video , Chap . 2 ) . Thrombosis is a critical event in the arterial diseases associated with myocardial infarction and stroke , and venous thromboembolic disorders ac - count for considerable morbidity and mortality . Moreover , venous thrombosis is the second leading cause of death in patients with cancer . Our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of thrombus formation has advanced greatly through the use of novel techniques for studying mouse models of thrombosis . In this article , we review recent advances in knowledge about thrombus formation . We also offer new hypotheses and some speculations about thrombus formation and the preven - tion and treatment of thrombosis . Figure 1 ( facing page ) . Thrombus Formation In Vivo . The developing thrombus in a living mouse after vessel - wall injury ( Panel A ) is characterized by the deposition of platelets ( red ) , tissue factor ( green ) , and fibrin ( blue ) . Platelet thrombus for - mation and fibrin deposition occur concomitantly . Platelets and tissue factor appear yellow ; tis - sue factor and fibrin , turquoise ; platelets and fibrin , magenta ; and platelets , fibrin , and tissue factor , white . A three - dimensional , confocal optical reconstruction of a thrombus in the lumen of an arteriole ( Panel B ) shows the platelet thrombus ( red and yellow ) being formed in the ves - sel wall , which is lined with the endothelium ( labeled green with antibodies to platelet - endothe - lial cell - adhesion molecule [ PECAM - 1 ] ) . Platelets are labeled red using antibodies to CD41 ; platelets stained with both CD41 and PECAM - 1 appear yellow . Calcium is mobilized during platelet activation . Panel C shows platelets loaded with a calcium - sensitive dye during thrombus formation ; resting platelets appear green , and activated platelets appear yellow . Labeled mi - croparticles bearing tissue factor ( Panel D , green ) infused into a recipient mouse accumulate in the developing thrombus . In Panel E , expression of protein disulfide isomerase ( PDI , green ) is shown during thrombus formation . Panel F shows fibrin ( green ) and platelets ( red ) , which ap - pear rapidly after vessel - wall injury and form a thrombus ; yellow indicates colocalization of fi - brin and platelets . In Panel G , inhibition of PDI blocks platelet accumulation and the generation of fibrin , and neither is observed .

The endothelium contains three throm - boregulators — nitric oxide , 1 , 2 prostacyclin , 3 and the ectonucleotidase CD39 4 — which together provide a defense against thrombus formation . Collagen in the subendothelial matrix and tissue factor facilitate the maintenance of a closed cir - culatory system . When the vessel wall is breached or the endothelium is disrupted , collagen and tis - sue factor become exposed to the flowing blood , thereby initiating formation of a thrombus ( Fig . 2 ) . Exposed collagen triggers the accumulation and activation of platelets , whereas exposed tis - sue factor initiates the generation of thrombin , which not only converts fibrinogen to fibrin but also activates platelets . 33p9 AUTHOR FIGURE JOB : ISSUE : 4 - C H / T RETAKE 1st 2nd SIZE ICM CASE EMail Line H / T Combo Revised AUTHOR , PLEASE NOTE : Figure has been redrawn and type has been reset .

The new england journal of medicine n engl j med 359 ; 9 www . nejm . org august 28 , 2008 940 Two Independent Pathways to Platelet Activation The idea that two distinct pathways acting in parallel or separately can activate platelets derives from recent studies of thrombus formation in ge - netically altered mice . 5 , 6 In one of these pathways , exposure of subendothelial collagen initiates platelet activation ; in the other , thrombin — gen - erated by tissue factor derived from the vessel wall or present in flowing blood — is the initia - tor ( Fig . 3 ) . Depending on the injury or the dis - ease , one pathway or the other may predominate , but the consequences of platelet activation trig - gered by these pathways are the same . The interactions of platelet glycoprotein VI ( see Glossary ) with the collagen of the exposed vessel wall and of platelet glycoprotein Ib - V - IX with collagen - bound von Willebrand factor result in adhesion of platelets to the site of injury ( Fig . 3 ) . The relative importance of platelet glycoproteins VI and Ib - V - IX in the initial tethering of platelets depends on the shear rate at the vessel wall . 7 However , the interaction of collagen with glyco - protein VI is required , as is glycoprotein Ib , a com - ponent of the glycoprotein Ib - V - IX complex . 5 , 8 , 9 In addition to its role in the adherence of plate - lets to collagen , glycoprotein VI is the major agonist for initial platelet activation and granule release . The platelet integrin α 2 β 1 plays a sup - portive but not essential role in the interaction between platelets and collagen . 10 , 11 Platelet acti - vation in this collagen - initiated pathway is inde - pendent of thrombin . Tissue factor triggers a second pathway that initiates platelet activation ( Fig . 3 ) . Platelet acti - vation initiated by this pathway does not require disruption of the endothelium and is independent of von Willebrand factor 12 and glycoprotein VI . 5 Experiments in mice have shown that only some of the adherent platelets become activated ( Fig . 1C ; and Video , Chap . 3 ) and that the activation of these platelets is independent of von Willebrand factor . 12 Tissue factor forms a complex with factor VIIa , the enzymatically active form of factor VII , and this tissue factor – factor VIIa complex activates factor IX , thereby initiating a proteolytic cascade that generates thrombin . Thrombin cleaves pro - tease - activated receptor 4 ( Par4 [ Par1 in humans ] ) on the platelet surface , thereby activating plate - lets 13 and causing them to release adenosine di - phosphate ( ADP ) , serotonin , and thromboxane A 2 . In turn , these agonists activate other platelets , and in so doing , amplify the signals for thrombus for - mation . This second pathway does not explain how platelets are recruited to a site of vessel in - jury where collagen is not exposed to flowing blood . Perhaps the initiating insult induces endo - thelial cells lining the affected vessel to display adhesive molecules that tether platelets to the in - jured endothelium . Specific experimental conditions can cause thrombus formation exclusively through the col - lagen or tissue factor pathway . 5 , 6 The exact con - tribution of the two pathways to platelet activa - tion is unknown , however , and their participation may vary with the underlying disease . Because of the redundancy of mechanisms that activate platelets , inhibitors of such targets as glycopro - tein VI in the collagen pathway or blood - clotting enzymes in the tissue factor pathway may not provide protection against platelet activation in all disorders .

Others remain loosely associated with the thrombus but do not undergo activation and may ultimately disengage from the thrombus ( Fig . 1C ) . 12 In short , thrombus formation is a dynamic process in which some platelets adhere to and others separate from the developing thrombus , and in which shear , flow , turbulence , and the number of platelets in the circulation greatly in - fluence the architecture of the clot . 08 / 13 / 08 AUTHOR PLEASE NOTE : Figure has been redrawn and type has been reset Please check carefully AuthorFig # Title DE MEArtist COLOR FIGURE Draft 2 Mech . of thrombus formation 2 ?

The new england journal of medicine n engl j med 359 ; 9 www . nejm . org august 28 , 2008 942 The platelet integrin α IIb β 3 , when activated , mediates recruitment of platelets to the throm - bus as well as platelet – platelet interactions . Acti - vation of α IIb β 3 requires an enzyme ( protein disulfide isomerase ) that catalyzes cleavage or formation of disulfide bonds between cysteine residues . 14 - 16 Activation of platelets bound to the wall of the injured vessel causes a conformational transition in α IIb β 3 that increases the affinity of the integrin for its ligands , fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor . 17 At low shear rates , fibrinogen is the predominant ligand , whereas von Wille - brand factor plays an important role at higher shear rates . 7 , 18 However , neither von Willebrand factor nor fibrinogen is absolutely required for platelet accumulation . 19 In addition , von Wille - brand factor is a ligand for glycoprotein Ib , but results in a mouse thrombosis model involving denudation of the endothelium suggest an as yet unidentified alternative ligand for glycoprotein Ib . 9 During platelet activation , late signaling events enhance platelet – platelet affinity . Growth - arrest – specific gene 6 , 20 CD40 ligand , 21 ephrin - Eph , 22 and signaling lymphocyte activation mol - ecule 23 participate in the platelet – platelet synapse to create a protected environment in the inter - stices of the clot that stabilizes the thrombus . 24 Platelet activation releases the contents of platelet alpha granules and dense granules , each of which carries a cargo of components that are critical for thrombus formation . Proteins are packaged in various subpopulations of alpha granules , 25 whereas ADP and calcium ions are packaged in the dense granules . The release of ADP stimulates platelet activation through two ADP receptors , P2Y1 and P2Y12 . The role of these receptors in platelet function and the pharma - cology of drugs directed against these receptors has recently been reviewed . 26 Blood Coagulation Tissue Factor A membrane protein , tissue factor is present on cells in numerous anatomical compartments and has multiple functions . In addition to initiating blood coagulation , tissue factor mediates intracel - lular signaling events that are important for angio - genesis , 27 tumor progression , 28 metastasis , 29 and maintenance of the yolk - sac vasculature . 30 Tissue factor is constitutively expressed on fibroblasts and pericytes in the adventitia and medial smooth - muscle cells of the vessel wall . It is also constitu - tively expressed on many nonvascular cells , and its expression on monocytes and endo thelial cells can be induced by chemical stimuli . 31 , 32 The idea that there may be functionally significant amounts of tissue factor on granulocytes and platelets re - mains controversial . 33 The endothelium was thought to act as a barrier separating factor VIIa in flowing blood from cellular sources of tissue factor in order to prevent the initiation of coagu - lation in the absence of injury . 34 However , tissue factor is also present in circulating blood , and this bloodborne tissue factor may participate in physiologic and pathologic processes . 35 Tissue factor is associated with some micro - Glossary Adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) : An agonist of platelet activation . α 2 β 1 : A platelet integrin that plays a role in collagen binding . α II b β 3 : An integrin that serves as the fibrinogen receptor on platelets . β 3 integrin : A subunit of integrins .

Tissue factor can exist in a latent ( or “encrypted” ) form that lacks coagulant activity or in an active form that initiates blood coagulation . 40 , 41 The molecular ba - sis of encryption is uncertain , but dimerization , 42 lipid reorganization , 43 and cellular secretion of tis - sue factor – rich granules 44 are among the proposed mechanisms . One of the two di sulfide bonds in tissue factor may be a labile allosteric disulfide bond 45 that can undergo cleavage or formation , with effects on the structure and function of the protein . 46 , 47 Oxidation of free thiols in encrypted tissue factor to form a disulfide bond yields a con - formation that allows the tissue factor – factor VIIa complex to bind to and activate factor X . 45 , 48 How can these altered disulfide bonds explain the transformation of bloodborne tissue factor from the encrypted to the active form in response to vessel - wall injury ? Activated endothelial cells and platelets at the site of injury release protein dis - ulfide isomerase , which catalyzes the formation and breakage of disulfide bonds between cysteine residues within proteins ( Fig . 1E ; and Video , Chap . 5 ) . 49 This enzyme is required for fibrin gen - eration and platelet thrombus formation ( Fig . 1F and 1G ; and Video , Chap . 6 ) . Perhaps it acts by promoting the formation of a functionally critical disulfide bond in tissue factor . Thrombin and Fibrin Tissue factor is the sole initiator of thrombin generation and fibrin formation . The contact pathway of blood coagulation , 50 , 51 a powerful tool for in vitro studies of the coagulation cas - cade , is not required for initiation of hemostasis in vivo . 52 A complete deficiency of factor XII , high - molecular - weight kininogen , or prekallekrein is associated with major defects in the initiation of the contact pathway of coagulation , as mani - fested by a markedly prolonged partial - thrombo - plastin time . Nevertheless , patients with any one of these deficiencies do not have a hemorrhagic disorder . The importance of factor XII in throm - bosis remains controversial , but in mice , a defi - ciency of factor XII or factor XI attenuates the development of thrombi . 53 - 55 Furthermore , inhi - bition or deficiency of factor XII protects mice from ischemic brain injury without causing hem - orrhage . 56 In humans , factor XI deficiency may be associated with a hemorrhagic phenotype . Factor XI may also participate in thrombosis in humans , because a deficiency of this protein is associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke but not of myocardial infarction . 57 A new iteration of the coagulation pathways is required to accommodate these findings and hypotheses ( Fig . 4 ) . We propose that the activa - tion of encrypted tissue factor by protein disul - fide isomerase initiates coagulation . On activa - tion , platelets and endothelial cells secrete the isomerase , 49 which converts inactive tissue fac - tor on cells or microparticles to its active form . In the case of direct tissue damage , tissue factor in the vessel wall or on cell surfaces may already exist in its active form , and the isomerase may not be required . This tissue factor pathway can be considered the fuse that ignites coagulation with a small amount of thrombin . 62 Other salient features of these coagulation pathways indicate that the sole initiator of thrombin generation is active tissue factor . Before thrombin is generat - ed , the tissue factor pathway , proceeding through factor IX or factor X , is inefficient because factors VIII and V , the circulating pro - cofactors required in the tenase and prothrombinase complexes , are not yet available in their most active cofactor form . This inefficient mechanism generates a small amount of thrombin . Once formed , throm - bin converts factors VIII and V to their cofactor forms , factor VIIIa and factor Va , respectively . The tenase and prothrombinase complexes now pro - ceed efficiently to generate a large burst of throm - bin . The tissue factor pathway is down - regulated , or inhibited , by the action of tissue factor path - way inhibitor , but thrombin generation proceeds without replenishing active tissue factor . 63 The New England Journal of Medicine Downloaded from nejm . org at UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS on June 2 , 2012 .

The new england journal of medicine n engl j med 359 ; 9 www . nejm . org august 28 , 2008 944 The question of what promotes continued thrombin generation in the absence of continued production of the active tissue factor – factor VIIa complex is unresolved . In vitro studies that can mimic thrombus formation in flowing blood by resupplying coagulation proteins in the absence of additional tissue factor and in the presence of factor XIIa inhibitors suggest that the prothrom - binase formed when tissue factor – factor VIIa ignites coagulation can sustain continued throm - bin generation . This newly formed thrombin feeds back to activate factors VIII and V , which form factors VIIIa and Va , triggering the greatly am - plified formation of additional thrombin through the pathway mediated by the fully active tenase and prothrombinase complexes . Alternatively , factor XI , which is activated by thrombin , 64 cre - ates a reservoir of initiator activity after the tis - sue factor pathway is terminated . 62 However , the ability of thrombin to activate factor XI in plas - ma has been questioned . 65 What are the membrane surfaces on which the tenase and prothrombinase complexes as - semble ? It has been thought that the membrane surface that is critical for thrombin generation is presented by the activated platelet . However , fi - brin generation in the Par4 - null mouse , whose platelets cannot be activated by thrombin , is nor - mal , 66 suggesting the importance of other mem - brane surfaces in vivo . Factor XII and factor XI are less important for hemostasis than for throm - bosis 52 ; nevertheless , this framework includes an important , albeit not critical , role of factor XI in hemostasis . Three questions remain unanswered : What activates factor XII during thrombosis , and why is activation of this zymogen not important during hemostasis ? What enzyme is responsible for the constitutive circulation of factor VIIa ? What are the cellular surfaces on which the te - nase and prothrombinase complexes assemble if activated platelets are not required ? Tissue Factor and Microparticles in Thrombotic Disorders Acute inflammation and infection , sepsis , and endotoxemia can induce a hypercoagulable state . When regulatory mechanisms are overwhelmed , acute disseminated intravascular coagulation en - sues , with consumption of blood coagulation proteins and platelets and , hence , bleeding . In the chronic form of disseminated intravascular coagulation , thrombosis rather than hemorrhage is predominant . Thrombosis and inflammation are related and mutually reinforcing processes , involving inflammatory mediators ( e . g . , endo - toxin , tumor necrosis factor α , and CD40 ligand ) , tissue factor expression on monocytes and the activated endothelium , 67 and circulating tissue factor – bearing microparticles . 37 A primary cause of thrombosis in disseminated intravascular co - agulation is disruption of endogenous anticoag - ulant pathways . Hemostatic Microparticles versus Pathologic Microparticles There is no detectable tissue factor activity in normal blood , 68 yet tissue factor – bearing micro - particles circulate in healthy persons . Perhaps tis - sue factor – bearing microparticles contain inac - tive tissue factor , which may become activated only when the particles are recruited to the site of vascular injury ( Fig . 5A ) . Pathologic microparticles may bear active tissue factor , which may confer a predisposition to thromboembolic events . Mi - Figure 4 ( facing page ) . Pathways of Blood Coagulation during Hemostasis and Thrombosis . Coagulation can be divided into the initiation phase ( Panel A ) and the amplification phase ( Panel B ) . Dur - ing initiation , the tissue factor – factor VIIa complex serves as a fuse to trigger blood coagulation by gener - ating small amounts of thrombin . Although the mecha - nism is not known , in this pathway the protein disul - fide isomerase ( PDI ) pathway is required for thrombin generation . Tissue factor forms a complex with circu - lating factor VIIa . 34 This complex , which plays a major role in coagulation , has three substrates : factor VII , factor IX , 58 and factor X . Factor IXa binds to factor VIII . 59 This complex inefficiently activates factor X to form factor Xa . Factor Xa , generated by the tissue fac - tor – factor VIIa complex or the factor IXa – factor VIII complex , binds factor V on membrane surfaces . This complex converts prothrombin to thrombin . The rate of thrombin generation with factor V is less than 1 % of the rate of thrombin generation in the presence of thrombin - activated factor Va . 60 , 61 During amplifica - tion , the thrombin generated activates factors VIII and V , leading to a burst of thrombin - generating potential . Alternatively , or in addition , thrombin may activate fac - tor XI . During hemostasis , the tissue factor pathway that is the fuse for initiation of coagulation is inactivat - ed . The tenase complex and prothrombinase complex efficiently generate the large thrombin burst . In some mechanisms of thrombosis , tissue factor may require activation by protein disulfide isomerase , whereas in other mechanisms , active tissue factor may be avail - able as a consequence of a related disease process .

The currently favored hypothesis is that rupture of the fibrous cap of the plaque initiates thrombus formation by exposing blood to collagen in the extracellular matrix , to previously sequestered tissue factor associated with lipid - laden macro - phages , or both . 79 , 80 Tissue factor , a component of atheroma , 81 is important in coronary throm - bosis ; in an animal model of coronary injury , tis - sue factor pathway inhibitor reduced the size of the thrombus . 82 The source of tissue factor at sites of plaque rupture has been inferred from anatomical analyses of pathological specimens after fatal myocardial infarction . However , the diffusion rates of proteins involved in blood co - agulation are too slow for tissue factor to migrate from the ruptured plaque into the growing throm - bus . 83 A proposed alternative mechanism is that tissue factor in the thrombus derives from tissue factor – bearing microparticles that bind to acti - vated platelets at the site of plaque rupture , per - haps by binding of platelet P - selectin to micro - particle PSGL - 1 . 35 , 36 , 84 Plaque rupture may be associated with activation of tissue factor from its encrypted form on microparticles . Oxidized lipids , such as choline glycerophospholipids , are implicated in platelet activation through CD36 , 85 and thrombus formation is blocked when extra - cellular protein disulfide isomerase is inhibited , perhaps preventing the activation of critical func - tions in platelet receptors and tissue factor . 49 New Str ategies for Antithrombotic Agents New pharmacologic agents , the most advanced of which are directed against factor Xa or thrombin , 86 have the potential to displace warfa - rin , heparin , and low - molecular - weight heparin for the treatment of and prophylaxis against thromboembolic disease .

The cap - ture of these microparticles in the developing thrombus , mediated by platelets ( yellow ) through P - selec tin and mi - croparticle P - selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 ( PSGL - 1 ) , leads to their accumulation at the injury site and results in activation of microparticle tissue factor ( red ) . 36 In con - trast , pathologic microparticles ( Panel B , red ) express active tissue factor 69 and are present at a high concentra - tion in the circulation . These microparticles accumulate , perhaps by binding to activated platelets ( yellow ) ; ex - pressing P - selectin , which captures microparticles through an as yet unidentified mucinous glycoprotein that is an analogue of the mucinous glyco protein PSGL - 1 ; or by binding to activated endothelium . In either case , tissue factor can lead to thrombin generation . Thrombin generation leads to platelet thrombus formation and fi - brin ( blue ) generation . However , as pathologic micropar - ticles bear active tissue factor , they do not require the ac - tivation step that may regulate formation of thrombin by action of hemostatic micro particles .

The ideal antithrombotic agent would inhibit thrombosis but spare hemostasis . Mechanisms of thrombosis differ among the various predis - posing conditions . The development of optimal pharmacologic agents for the prevention of throm - bosis associated with a particular disease should include consideration of specific mechanisms . Since injury to the vessel wall is the major hemo - static challenge , independent strategies for block - ing pathologic thrombosis should focus on path - ways that do not involve repair of breached vessels . Activated factor XII might be an example of a target for new inhibitors of thrombin genera - tion : occlusive thrombi do not form in mice lack - ing factor XII , 53 , 56 and neither mice nor humans who are deficient in factor XII have a hemostatic defect . The evidence implicating microparticles that display tumor - derived or monocyte - derived tissue factor in the thrombotic complications of cancer or inflammation suggests that such par - ticles could be suitable targets for thrombopro - phylaxis . In a mouse model of laser - induced vas - cular injury , inhibition of the reaction between P - selectin and the PSGL - 1 receptor has been shown to block the accumulation of micropar - ticles bearing monocyte - derived tissue factor in a developing thrombus . 36 Although not yet tested clinically , this observation suggests the possibil - ity that pharmacologic inhibitors that disrupt the P - selectin – PSGL - 1 interaction may have the po - tential to act as antithrombotic agents , especially in disorders that are associated with activation of endothelial cells but in which the integrity of the endothelium is preserved . 87 - 89 Inhibition of tissue factor or prevention of microparticle accumula - tion might provide prophylactic treatment against cancer - associated thrombosis . Thrombosis remains a final pathway to dis - ease and death in some of our most common diseases : myocardial infarction , stroke , and can - cer . Although substantial progress has been made in understanding the biology of thrombus for - mation and the pathophysiology of thrombosis , all the pharmacologic agents available for preven - tion or treatment have been in use for decades or have been replaced with newer variants that offer a modest incremental improvement . The ideal drug for prophylaxis and treatment of thrombotic disease remains an agent that will inhibit thrombosis but not hemostasis . The trans - lation of new knowledge from in vitro and in vivo studies in animal models to pharmaceutical development presents opportunities for substan - tial advances in the prevention of thrombotic diseases .
