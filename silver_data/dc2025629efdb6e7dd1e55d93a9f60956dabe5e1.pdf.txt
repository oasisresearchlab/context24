So far , there is no evidence that tumors can stimulate the growth of new lymphatic vessels ( 23 ) , but further studies should establish the role of VEGF - C in lymphangiomas and in tumor metastasis via the lymphatic vasculature as well as in various other disorders involving the lym - phatic system and their treatment .

For electron microscopy , tissue pieces from two transgenic skin biopsies were fixed in formaldehyde , postfixed in 2 % osmium tetroxide , and embedded in LX 112 .

The human VEGF - C antisense RNA probe was generated from linearized pCR™II plas - mid ( Invitrogen ) containing an Eco RI fragment cor - responding to nucleotides 628 through 1037 of hu - man VEGF - C cDNA . The VEGFR - 3 probe was de - scribed earlier ( 18 ) . The VEGFR - 2 probe was an Eco RI fragment covering base pairs 1958 through 2683 ( GenBank accession number X59397 , a gift from J .

For measurement of DNA synthesis , small ( 3 mm by 3 mm ) skin biopsies from four transgenic and four control mice were incubated in Dulbecco’s modification of Eagle’s medium with 10 (cid:109) g / ml BrdU for 6 hours at 37°C , fixed in 70 % ethanol for 12 hours , and embedded in paraffin . After a 30 - min treatment with 0 . 1 % pepsin in 0 . 1 M HCl at room temperature to denature DNA , staining was carried out as above with mouse monoclonal antibodies to BrdU ( Amersham ) . 29 . Fluorescence microlymphography was performed as follows . The staining of the lymphatic network in vivo was carried out as described ( 20 ) . Briefly , 8 - week - old mice were anesthetized and placed on a heating pad to maintain a 37°C temperature . A 30 - gauge needle , connected to a catheter filled with a solution of FITC - dextran ( 2 M , 8 mg / ml in phos - phate - buffered solution ) , was injected intradermally into the tip of the tail . The solution was infused with a constant hydrostatic pressure equivalent to a 50 - cm column of water ( flow rate averaging roughly 0 . 01 (cid:109) l / min ) until the extent of network filling remained constant ( approximately 2 hours ) . Flow rate and flu - orescence intensity were monitored continuously throughout the experiment . The intravital fluores - cence microscopy of blood vessels was as de - scribed ( 24 ) . 30 .

Chen , Milan Mrksich , Sui Huang , George M . Whitesides , Donald E . Ingber * Human and bovine capillary endothelial cells were switched from growth to apoptosis by using micropatterned substrates that contained extracellular matrix - coated adhesive islands of decreasing size to progressively restrict cell extension . Cell spreading also was varied while maintaining the total cell - matrix contact area constant by changing the spacing between multiple focal adhesion - sized islands . Cell shape was found to govern whether individual cells grow or die , regardless of the type of matrix protein or antibody to integrin used to mediate adhesion . Local geometric control of cell growth and viability may therefore represent a fundamental mechanism for developmental regulation within the tissue microenvironment . T he local differentials in cell growth and viability that drive morphogenesis in com - plex tissues , such as branching capillary net - works ( 1 , 2 ) , are controlled through modu - lation of cell binding to extracellular matrix ( ECM ) ( 3 – 6 ) . Local disruption of ECM by pharmacologic or genetic means results in selective programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) within adjacent cells ( 2 , 6 , 7 ) . Soluble in - tegrin (cid:97) V (cid:98) 3 antagonists also induce apo - ptosis in cultured endothelial cells and pro - mote capillary involution in vivo ( 8 ) . Fur - thermore , death can be prevented by allow - ing suspended cells to attach to immobilized antibodies to integrins or by inhibiting ty - rosine phosphatases ( 7 , 9 ) . For these rea - sons , adhesion - dependent control of apo - ptosis has been assumed to be mediated by changes in integrin signaling . Analysis of capillary regression in vivo , however , has revealed that dying capillary cells remain in contact with ECM fragments , thus suggest - ing that the cell foreshortening caused by ECM dissolution may be the signal that initiates the death program ( 2 ) . This possi - bility is supported by the finding that en - dothelial cells spread and grow on large ( (cid:46) 100 - (cid:109) m diameter ) microcarrier beads ( 4 ) , whereas they rapidly die when bound to small ( 4 . 5 (cid:109) m ) ECM - coated beads ( 10 ) that cluster integrins and activate signaling but do not support cell extension ( 11 ) . Understanding how this apoptotic switch is controlled in capillary cells has enormous clinical implications , because an - giogenesis is a prerequisite for tumor growth ( 12 ) . Thus , we set out to determine wheth - er cell shape or integrin binding per se governs life and death in these cells . We first measured apoptosis rates in suspended C . S . Chen , S . Huang , D .

Most cells survived when spread on FN - coated planar dishes in medium that contained saturating amounts of growth factors , whereas about 60 % of nonadherent cells entered the death pro - gram within 24 hours ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) . In contrast , fewer than 10 % of cells adherent to large ( (cid:46) 25 (cid:109) m ) FN - coated beads under - went programmed cell death . Unlike sus - pended cells , which remained small and spherical , these cells and their nuclei ap - peared to flatten as they extended around the beads ( Fig . 1A ) . Importantly , as the bead diameter was decreased to 10 (cid:109) m , cells became more rounded , and the apoptotic index increased to match that in nonadher - ent cells ( Fig . 1B ) . The size of these spherical beads affects not only the degree of cell and nuclear spreading but also ECM curvature and bead internalization . The 10 - (cid:109) m beads appeared fully engulfed by cells within 4 hours , whereas the 25 - (cid:109) m beads were never fully internalized . To eliminate these complicat - ing factors , we used a microscale patterning technique ( 13 , 14 ) to fabricate planar ad - hesive islands of defined size and shape , separated by nonadhesive regions . When plated on circular FN - coated islands 10 or 20 (cid:109) m in diameter , cells spread until they took on the size and shape of the underlying adhesive island ( Fig . 1C ) . Significantly more cells entered apoptosis when held in a round form on 20 - (cid:109) m circles than when spread on identically fabricated unpat - terned substrates ( Fig . 1D ) . Furthermore , the subtle decrease in cell and nuclear spreading observed in cells on 10 - compared with 20 - (cid:109) m islands ( Fig . 1C ) was also ac - companied by a statistically significant in - crease in apoptosis ( Fig . 1D ) . Capillary cell spreading on ECM also has been shown to modulate cell cycle pro - gression ( 4 , 11 , 15 ) . To determine the pre - cise spreading requirements for survival rather than growth , we cultured cells syn - chronized in the quiescent phase of the cell cycle on different - sized FN - coated adhesive islands . The different - sized islands were contained within a single substrate ( Fig . 2A ) to rule out the possibility that changes in cell behavior could be due to the release of paracrine growth modulators . When we plated cells on square - shaped islands coated with FN , square - shaped cells were produced that closely matched the size and shape of the adhesive island ( Fig . 2A ) . Apoptosis progressively declined when the island size was increased from 75 to 3000 (cid:109) m 2 , where - as DNA synthesis was concomitantly switched on as cell and nuclear spreading were promoted ( Fig . 2B ) . These results demonstrate that increased cell spreading on a homogeneous , high - density coating of FN leads to cell survival and growth . However , the total area of cell - ECM contact also increases under these conditions , so integrin binding , focal adhesion formation , and accessibility to ma - trix - bound growth factors ( 16 ) may all vary in parallel . To explore this mechanism more fully , we evaluated apoptosis and Fig . 1 . Effect of cell spreading on apoptosis .

Cell bodies spread across the intervening nonadhesive areas of the substrate , stretch - ing processes from one small adhesive island to another . Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that adherent cells attached and formed vinculin - containing focal adhesions only on the engineered islands ( Fig . 3C ) . By changing the spacing between adhesive is - lands , we could increase cell spreading 10 - fold without significantly altering the total cell - ECM contact area ( Fig . 3D ) . On these substrates , DNA synthesis scaled directly with projected cell area and not with cell - ECM contact area ( Fig . 3D ) . Apoptosis was similarly switched off by cell spreading , even though the cell - ECM contact area remained constant under these conditions ( Fig . 3D ) . Thus , cell shape per se appears to be the critical determinant that switches cells between life and death and between proliferation and quiescence . In vivo studies demonstrate that pro - grammed cell death and capillary regression can be induced by inhibiting integrin (cid:97) V (cid:98) 3 binding , whereas apoptosis can be prevent - ed in vitro by attachment of cells to immo - bilized antibodies to integrin (cid:98) 1 ( anti - (cid:98) 1 ) ( 8 , 9 ) . Because cell binding to FN is medi - ated by both (cid:98) 1 and (cid:98) 3 integrins , we chose to explore their role in shape - dependent control of apoptosis . We coated unpat - terned substrates and 20 - (cid:109) m circular islands with antibodies specific for (cid:98) 1 or (cid:97) V (cid:98) 3 in - tegrins , FN , or physiological ECM ligands that preferentially use integrin (cid:98) 1 ( type I collagen ) or (cid:97) V (cid:98) 3 ( vitronectin ) . Apoptosis was greatly inhibited relative to the 60 % level observed in suspended cells when cells spread on unpatterned substrates regardless of the integrin ligand used ( Fig . 4 ) . How - ever , survival was consistently greater in cells that adhered to intact ECM proteins . When spreading was restricted by use of 20 - (cid:109) m circles , cells adherent to integrin (cid:98) 1 ligands ( FN , type I collagen , anti - (cid:98) 1 , or anti - (cid:98) 1 combined with anti - (cid:97) V (cid:98) 3 ) exhibit - ed much greater increases in apoptosis com - pared with those on either intact vitronec - tin or on anti - (cid:97) V (cid:98) 3 alone ( Fig . 4 ) . This was due to a change in sensitivity , rather than a lack of response , because similar high levels of apoptosis were induced when cell spread - ing was further restricted by plating on 10 - (cid:109) m circular islands . Thus , although geomet - ric switching between growth and apoptosis is a general phenomenon , different adhesion receptors appear to be able to convey distinct death signals and thereby tune the cellular response to shape distortion . The mechanism by which cells trans - duce changes in cell geometry into different biochemical responses remains unclear . The specialized cytoskeletal structure , or focal adhesion complex , that forms intracellu - larly at the site of integrin binding is a molecular bridge that mechanically couples integrins , and hence ECM , to the actin cytoskeleton ( 17 – 19 ) . Because focal adhe - sions also orient much of the signal trans - duction machinery of the cell ( 20 ) , they may integrate mechanical signals associated with changes in cell shape with chemical signals elicited directly by integrin binding and thereby modulate downstream signaling ( 21 ) . In fact , constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase , pp125 FAK , in the focal ad - hesion complex can lead to shape - and ad - hesion - independent cell survival and growth ( 22 , 23 ) . Alternatively , growth and viability may be altered directly by mechanical stress - dependent changes in the organization or stiffness of the cytoskeleton and nucleus ( 18 , 19 , 21 , 24 ) . For example , the increased flex - ibility of the cytoskeleton that has been ob - served in rounded cells ( 18 ) may permit intracellular structural rearrangements that are lethal , including the characteristic struc - tural degeneration of the cell and nucleus that are hallmarks of apoptosis . The finding that cell survival is more tightly coupled to cell shape in cells adherent to ligands for integrin (cid:98) 1 compared with integrin (cid:97) V (cid:98) 3 is also consistent with the observation that (cid:98) 1 provides stronger ECM anchoring to resist cytoskeletal tension ( 18 ) . From this perspec - tive , adhesive substrates may prevent cell death and promote growth by resisting con - tractile forces transmitted across integrins , thereby mechanically stabilizing the nucleo - cytoskeletal lattice . During morphogenesis , growing , quies - cent , and dying cells often co - exist within the same microenvironment ( 1 , 2 ) . In fact , the establishment of local differentials in cell growth and viability drives pattern for - mation . Our results suggest that living cells can filter the same set of chemical inputs ( activation of integrin and growth factor receptor signaling ) to produce different functional outputs ( growth versus apo - ptosis ) as a result of local mechanical defor - mation of the cell or nucleus . By sensing their degree of extension or compression , cells therefore may be able to monitor local changes in cell crowding or ECM compli - Fig . 3 .

Sanes * In the vertebrate brain , neurons grouped in parallel laminae receive distinct sets of synaptic inputs . In the avian optic tectum , arbors and synapses of most retinal axons are confined to 3 of 15 laminae . The adhesion molecule N - cadherin and cell surface gly - coconjugates recognized by a plant lectin are selectively associated with these “reti - norecipient” laminae . The lectin and a monoclonal antibody to N - cadherin perturbed laminar selectivity in distinct fashions . In contrast , neurotrophins increased the com - plexity of retinal arbors without affecting their laminar distribution . Thus , cell surface molecules and soluble trophic factors may collaborate to shape lamina - specific arbors in the brain , with the former predominantly affecting their position and the latter their size . M any parts of the vertebrate brain are organized into parallel laminae that bear distinct neuronal subtypes and receive dis - tinct synaptic inputs ( 1 – 3 ) . In the optic tectum of the chick , for example , most retinal axons terminate in just 3 of 15 laminae ( Fig . 1A ) . Each individual axon arborizes within a single lamina , even though the dendrites of some postsynaptic cells extend through many laminae ( 4 – 6 ) . The lamina - selective arborization of in - coming axons may be a major determinant of specific synaptic connectivity . To elucidate the mechanisms underlying lamina - specific retinotectal connectivity , we devised a coculture system in which a trans - verse tectal section was overlaid with a retinal strip , such that neurites from retinal ganglion cells had equal access to all tectal laminae ( Fig . 1B ) . Outgrowth and arborization on these sections reproduced the lamina - selec - tive patterns observed in vivo , implicating local tectal cues in axonal guidance ( 5 ) . Moreover , lamina - selective growth persisted when sections were chemically fixed before retinal strips were added , which implied that some cues are associated with the cell surface and are independent of activity ( 5 ) .
