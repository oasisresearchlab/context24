These events are driven by the coordinated activities of a set of 20 to 30 highly conserved actin - associated proteins , in addition to many cell - speciﬁc ac - tin - associated proteins and numerous upstream signaling mol - ecules . The combined activities of these factors control with exquisite precision the spatial and temporal assembly of actin structures and ensure dynamic turnover of actin structures such that cells can rapidly alter their cytoskeletons in response to internal and external cues . One of the most exciting princi - ples to emerge from the last decade of research on actin is that the assembly of architecturally diverse actin structures is gov - erned by highly conserved machinery and mechanisms . With this realization , it has become apparent that pioneering efforts in budding yeast have contributed substantially to deﬁning the universal mechanisms regulating actin dynamics in eukaryotes . In this review , we ﬁrst describe the ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) structures found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( patches , cables , and rings ) and their physiological functions , and then we discuss in detail the speciﬁc roles of actin - associated pro - teins and their biochemical mechanisms of action . For more detailed information on actin - based cellular processes , we re - fer readers to a number of excellent recent reviews that cover these topics in greater depth : endocytosis ( 93 ) , mitochondrial inheritance ( 42 ) , vacuolar inheritance ( 45 ) , establishment of cell polarity ( 302 , 305 , 334 ) , and cytokinesis ( 22 , 33 ) . In some sections we present data and concepts in a historical order , where tracing the progression is instructive . We also note that the majority of the cellular actin structures and their compo - nents are conserved between budding yeast and ﬁssion yeast , and in many cases insights from ﬁssion yeast preceded those from budding yeast . Due to space constraints we have focused the review on the budding yeast actin cytoskeleton , but we highlight experiments from ﬁssion yeast to reinforce speciﬁc points . ACTIN STRUCTURES AND FUNCTIONS IN YEAST CELLS First Contact The ﬁrst major insights into organization of the yeast actin cytoskeleton came from two landmark papers in 1984 by Adams , Kilmartin , and Pringle ( 2 , 183 ) . In the preceding years , actin had been puriﬁed from yeast cells ( 393 ) , and it had been established that actin was expressed from a single essential gene in S . cerevisiae , ACT1 ( 349 ) , but the distribution of actin in yeast cells remained a mystery . Using ﬂuorochrome - labeled drugs ( 2 ) and actin antibodies ( 183 ) , Adams and coworkers visualized ﬁlamentous actin in chemically ﬁxed cells and de - scribed an “unusual distribution of actin” consisting of two distinct structures ( Fig . 1 ) : cortical spots ( “patches” ) and long ﬁbers ( “cables” ) . Their elegant description of actin organiza - tion ( see details below ) set the stage for the recent advances in cell biological analyses on yeast actin described in the following sections : “Numerous small patches or spots were seen distrib - uted over the cell surface ; the cortical location of these spots FIG . 1 . Cell cycle - regulated organization of the S . cerevisiae actin cytoskeleton . Yeast cells at different stages in the cell cycle contain three visible F - actin structures : cortical actin patches , polarized actin cables , and a cytokinetic actin ring . While patches and cables are visible throughout the cell cycle , the ring is visible shortly before and during cytokinesis . Shown here are actively growing cells from an asynchronous culture that were chemically ﬁxed and stained with rho - damine phalloidin to visualize ﬁlamentous actin structures .

In addition , ﬁbers were seen coursing through the cells , generally in a direction roughly parallel to the long axes of the cells . In unbudded cells , there was often a concentration of ﬂuores - cence near one pole , and in cells with very small buds there was generally a pronounced concentration of ﬂuorescence in the bud . In both cases , the concentration of ﬂuorescence was usu - ally resolvable as a cluster of individual spots . In cells with medium - sized buds , there was typically a higher concentration of ﬂuorescent spots in the bud than in the mother cell . Cells with very large buds often showed a concentration of ﬂuores - cence in the neck region , sometimes apparently as clusters of spots and sometimes apparently as a band . ” ( Reproduced with permission from reference 2 . ) In addition to patches and cables , Adams and coworkers noted the presence of a third actin structure located at the neck of some large - budded cells , which they referred to ( above ) as a “band . ” Twenty years later , it is clear that this was the ﬁrst sighting of the budding yeast actomyosin contractile ring . However , the concept of a budding yeast actomyosin ring lay relatively dormant over the next 14 years , in part due to the fact that actin rings are present only transiently during the cell cycle and therefore observed in only a limited number of cells in an asynchronously growing culture and in part because they can be more difﬁcult to image than patches and cables . In addition , many in the ﬁeld believed that the narrowness of the bud neck , approximately 1 (cid:2) m during budding yeast cytokine - sis ( 327 ) , precluded the requirement for an actomyosin con - tractile ring . Then , in 1998 , the presence of a functional acto - myosin ring was conﬁrmed by two independent studies ( 34 , 217 ) which revealed that the events of cytokinesis in yeast and animals were more similar than previously thought . Studies in 1986 revealed that the three visible F - actin struc - tures in budding yeast—patches , cables , and rings—are also present in the ﬁssion yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe ( 231 ) . A large body of literature since then has shown that the mech - anisms regulating patch and cable assembly in ﬁssion and bud - ding yeast are similar but that the rules governing assembly of the actomyosin ring differ signiﬁcantly ( see below ) . In addition , smaller and / or less visible actin structures may exist in both ﬁssion and budding yeast , as suggested by the requirement for actin dynamics in the processes of vacuolar fusion ( 92 ) , endo - plasmic reticulum cortical dynamics ( 301 ) , and chromatin re - modeling ( 38 ) . Visualizing these actin structures in vivo rep - resents a key challenge for the future . Actin Patches and Endocytosis Early observations . Initial observations showing that patches are concentrated at sites of polarized growth suggested that patch function might be linked to secretion . However , patches are decorated with numerous actin - associated proteins , and as mutations in these patch components were characterized , it became apparent that their primary defects were endocytic rather than secretory . Multiple patch components ( e . g . , actin , Arc35 , Rvs167 , Sac6 , Sla2 , and Vrp1 ) were identiﬁed in ran - dom screens for mutants defective in endocytosis , end mutants ( 64 , 86 , 93 , 202 , 260 , 309 , 311 ) . In addition , an endocytic function for actin was suggested by defects in ﬂuid uptake ( marked by Lucifer Yellow ) upon treatment of cells with latrunculin - A ( Lat - A ) , an actin monomer - sequestering agent ( 19 ) . Over the following years , genetic studies continued to steadily draw correlations between the functions of patch com - ponents and endocytosis , but this linkage was not solidiﬁed and fully accepted until recent light and electron microscopy ( EM ) studies addressed the dynamic movement and ultrastructure of cortical actin patches ( see below ) . Although it is now apparent that actin patches mediate en - docytosis , they may also be coupled to exocytosis . No patch components were isolated in the original sec mutant screen ( 271 ) , but mutants of a number of patch components show an accumulation of post - Golgi vesicles ( 139 , 213 , 257 ) , consistent with models that suggest temporal and spatial links between endocytosis and exocytosis . Actin patch dynamics . An important and unanticipated property of actin patches was discovered with the advent of green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) fusions to monitor real - time behavior of proteins in cells . By tagging patch components ( Sac6 , Cap1 / Cap2 , Abp1 , and actin ) with GFP , two initial stud - ies demonstrated that patches are highly motile ( 80 , 387 ) . These and other early studies showed that the lifetime of actin patches is approximately 10 to 20 seconds and that actin patches ﬁrst assemble at sites of polarized cell growth and then move slowly and nondirectionally along the cell cortex . In addition , more - rapid movements were observed . Patch motility rates ranged from 0 . 1 to 0 . 5 (cid:2) m / s ( 52 , 354 , 387 ) . These observations raised an important mechanistic ques - tion : what provides the force driving patch movement ? A de - cade ago , when patch motility was ﬁrst observed , most forms of actin - based motility were thought to be myosin dependent . So , it came as a surprise when it was reported that the rate of patch motility was unaffected by mutations in any of the ﬁve yeast myosin genes : MYO3 and MYO5 ( type I ) , MYO1 ( type II ) , or MYO2 and MYO4 ( type V ) ( 354 , 387 ) . Instead , studies using Lat - A suggested that the actin ﬁlaments in patches undergo rapid turnover ( 19 ) and that Lat - A inhibits patch movement ( 52 , 289 ) , suggesting that actin polymerization may provide the force required for patch motility . As such , parallels were drawn between yeast actin patch motility and the actin polymeriza - tion - based motility of the intracellular pathogen Listeria mono - cytogenes , which hijacks the host actin nucleation machinery ( the Arp2 / 3 complex ) to assemble a highly branched actin “comet tail” ( 287 , 407 ) , propelling the bacterium at approxi - mately 0 . 4 (cid:2) m / s ( 70 , 368 ) . While it has been appealing in models to depict actin patches like miniature Listeria actin comet tails trailing endocytic vesicles , patches have at least two key properties that distinguish them from Listeria . First , coﬁlin activity , and therefore rapid actin turnover , is required for Listeria motility ( 287 ) but not rapid patch movement ( 204 , 287 ) . Second , Listeria motility is autonomous in living cells and cell extracts , requiring only the actin tail that it forms for propulsion . However , the rapid phase of patch motility ( see below ) relies on an additional separate network of ﬁlamentous actin structures , actin cables ( 159 ) . From a number of recent studies , it has become apparent that actin patches mature in stages corresponding to different stages of endocytosis and characterized by different types of movement . One of the ﬁrst indications of this behavior came from a study examining the dual localization and ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer between CFP - Abp1 ( an activator of V OL . 70 , 2006 MECHANISM AND FUNCTION OF THE YEAST ACTIN CYTOSKELETON 607 on N o v e m be r 1 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / mm b r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m the Arp2 / 3 complex ) and YFP - Sla1 ( an early endocytic pro - tein ) ( 391 ) . This showed that at any given time , a subset of patches colabeled with Abp1 and Sla1 , while others contained exclusively Sla1 or Abp1 . Intriguingly , the patches labeled ex - clusively with Abp1 were highly motile , whereas those labeled exclusively with Sla1 exhibited little movement . The authors hypothesized that “Sla1 - only” patches might contain endocytic machinery and the arrival of Abp1 ( and possibly other factors ) facilitated actin polymerization - based rapid movement of patches . This study emphasized the need to consider temporal changes in the development and lifetime of an actin patch . Subsequent studies by Kaksonen et al . ( 173 , 174 ) resolved many of the key events in patch development by elegantly correlating temporal changes in patch motility with the arrival of speciﬁc components . Using pairs of integrated functional ﬂuorescent tags on different patch components ( Las17 , Sla1 , Sla2 , Pan1 , Abp1 , and the Arp2 / 3 complex ) and computer algorithms to track patch movements , they deﬁned three stages in the lifetime of a patch . First , nonmotile patches , which contain Las17 , Sla1 , and Pan1 , but not actin , form at the cell cortex . Next , polymerized actin appears , which coincides with the onset of slow patch movements at the cortex ( 0 . 05 to 0 . 1 (cid:2) m / s ) . Patches transition to a phase of rapid inward movement from the cell cortex , likely as vesicles coated with actin ﬁla - ments . Addition of Lat - A abolishes both the slow and fast patch movements ( stages 2 and 3 ) , suggesting that this motility is actin polymerization based ( 289 , 407 ) . The roles of speciﬁc patch components are discussed below in a model for patch development . Shortly after the initial Kaksonen study ( 173 ) , Huckaba et al . ( 159 ) reported three key ﬁndings clarifying patch function and mechanism . First , they showed that endocytic vesicles ( marked by the lipophilic marker FM4 - 64 ) colocalize with motile patches ( marked by Abp1 - GFP ) during slow and fast phases of movement ( Fig . 2A ) . This provided direct evidence that actin patches are sites of endocytic uptake . Second , they showed that rapid actin patch movement is mediated by polarized actin cables , as internalized actin patches colocalize with cables ( Fig . 2B ) and move directionally with cables at a similar rate ( (cid:3) 0 . 3 (cid:2) m / s ) , and rapid patch movements are lost upon disruption of cables by speciﬁc conditional mutants ( 159 ) . Third , internal - ized patches / vesicles appear to fuse eventually with endosomal compartments and shed their actin coats . The movement of patches on cables is consistent with an earlier live cell imaging study from ﬁssion yeast ( 289 ) . Thus , slow patch movements in the cell cortex ( possibly to facilitate vesicle formation and scission ) depend on an Arp2 / 3 complex - based actin poly - merization mechanism , whereas rapid inward movement of patches depends on a mechanism of transporting patches on cables . These ﬁndings raise further questions that remain un - resolved . What factors link patches to cables ? How do cables deliver patches to endosomes , and are endosomes linked to cables ? What signal triggers actin coat shedding at endosomes ? In animal cell endocytosis , short bursts of actin polymeriza - tion at the cell cortex ( similar to actin patch assembly ) are accompanied by clathrin coat formation . Several yeast actin patch components are physically linked to clathrin and its adaptors , suggesting that clathrin may participate in patch dy - namics ( 21 ) . However , until recently , the direct involvement of clathrin in yeast endocytosis remained controversial , in part because endocytic defects in clathrin mutants are not fully penetrant , and in part because clathrin localization at cortical patches had not been demonstrated ( 21 ) . In addition , clathrin - coated pits had not been observed in EM studies on the yeast cell cortex ( 255 , 314 ) , but two recent studies have provided convincing evidence that clathrin indeed localizes to early patches to facilitate endocytosis ( 174 , 266 ) . The localization of clathrin at the cell cortex had been masked by abundant clath - rin staining on internal membranous structures . This technical limitation was overcome using total internal reﬂection ﬂuores - cence ( TIRF ) microscopy , which reduces ﬂuorescent back - ground and permits focused observation of ﬂuorescence at the cell cortex . Both studies used TIRF to show that clathrin is recruited to early patches , possibly by Sla2 , and then later disappears upon transition of patches to fast inward movement ( 174 , 266 ) . Further , it was shown that almost all clathrin patches at the cortex subsequently recruit actin ( i . e . , become actin patches ) and that clathrin mutants cause delays in early stages of patch development . These studies have ended the debate over whether clathrin functions in yeast endocytosis and raise exciting new questions , such as what signaling mech - anisms control recruitment and subsequent loss of clathrin at patches . Another factor that plays a key role in endocytosis in animal cells is dynamin , a GTPase that tubulates membranes and facilitates vesicle scission ( 298 ) . Although multiple dy - FIG . 2 .

( B ) Actin patches ( Abp1 - HcRed ) undergo limited short - range move - ments while associated with the cell cortex and then transition to a phase of rapid movement upon internalization . The arrowhead tracks the rapid movement of a single actin patch moving over time . The patch moves in a retrograde manner ( bud to mother cell ) on the end of an actin cable ( marked by Abp140 - GFP ) . The rate of fast patch movement is approximately the same as the rate of cable movement ( 0 . 2 to 0 . 4 (cid:2) m per s ) , suggesting that patches may be transported passively through attachment to cables . The molecular interactions linking patches to cables are unknown . Bars , 2 (cid:2) m .

Actin patch ultrastructure . Ultimately , to fully understand the inner workings of actin patches , a detailed understanding of patch ultrastructure will be required at a resolution beyond the limits of light microscopy . However , only a few studies using EM have been successful in elucidating details of patch ultrastructure , due to the unique technical challenges pre - sented when analyzing actin in yeast cells : the presence of a cell wall , a concentrated and thus crowded cytoplasm , and a low concentration of actin ﬁlaments . Initial EM observations of two - dimensional thin slices revealed that actin patches associ - ate with ﬁnger - like invaginations ( potential sites of endocyto - sis ) at the plasma membrane ( 256 ) ( Fig . 3A and B ) . Additional work on thin slices demonstrated limited colocalization of ac - tin with sites of receptor - mediated endocytosis ( 255 ) and dis - organized actin ﬁlament structures in endocytic mutants ( 340 ) . Using complementary EM techniques , a recent study by Rodal et al . has provided the ﬁrst three - dimensional informa - tion on patch ultrastructure ( 314 ) . Intact samples of the yeast cell cortex , prepared using quick freezing and deep etching , revealed densely branched networks of actin ﬁlaments labeled with antibodies to actin , Abp1 , the Arp2 / 3 complex , and Crn1 ( 314 ) ( Fig . 3C and D ) . The caveat to this methodology is that it requires the use of spheroplasted cells . However , sphero - plasted cells maintain endocytosis ( 299 ) , suggesting that the structures preserved and visualized by EM represent func - tional actin patches . The structures are cone shaped , with the Arp2 / 3 complex positioned at the apex , and there may be some relationship between these actin mounds and the ﬁnger - like invaginations reported by thin sectioning ( Fig . 3 ) . In another study , Young et al . ( 423 ) used partial cell lysis to leach semi - intact actin patches from cells , purify them through multiple steps , and image them by EM . The actin ﬁlaments in these structures form a branched network , and decoration with my - osin S1 fragment showed that the ﬁlaments have uniform po - larity . When combined with the in vivo observations of Rodal et al . ( 316 ) showing that the Arp2 / 3 complex ( which binds to ﬁlament pointed ends ) is positioned at the apex of cone - shaped actin patches , these observations suggest that the majority of actin ﬁlament barbed ends in actin patches may be oriented towards the cell cortex . This assignment of ﬁlament polarity also is supported by photobleaching experiments in sla2 mu - tants ( 173 ) , which block patch internalization and lead to hy - perextended patch - like structures . A photobleached band within this extended structure moves away from the cell cortex , suggesting that new monomers are incorporated on barbed ends of ﬁlaments at the cortex . Uniﬁed model for actin patch development and function . In this section , we provide a working model for actin patch de - velopment and endocytosis , based on the work described above and additional studies introduced below ( Fig . 4 ) . ( i ) Early recruitment : nonmotile phase . The early recruit - ment process may begin with cytosolic regions of membrane receptors , possibly after being modiﬁed by kinases and ubiq - uitin ligases , associating with endocytic machinery ( 147 , 156 , 323 , 346 , 362 ) . Alternatively , some of the early endocytic ma - chinery may reside in patches at the cell cortex and recruit and concentrate receptors . Supporting this second possibility , a recent study has described the existence of a static complex— termed the eisosome—that marks the future site of actin patch formation and contains the proteins Pil1 , Lsp1 , and Sur7 ( 390 ) . It is important to note that actin patches also formed at sites independent of eisosomes , suggesting multiple mechanisms for specifying sites of actin patch assembly . The initial endocytic machinery recruited to patches includes clathrin and multiple scaffolds and clathrin adaptors : Yap1801 and Yap1802 ( AP180 homologues ) , Ent1 and Ent2 ( epsin homologues ) , Ede1 ( Eps15R homologue ) , Scd5 , Sla1 , and Sla2 ( 6 , 115 , 145 , 156 , 266 ) . These proteins recruit additional early patch components that promote actin assembly , such as Pan1 , End3 , and Las17 , to form a complex network of interacting factors . Speciﬁcally , the nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) ( see below ) Pan1 and Las17 may directly recruit and activate the Arp2 / 3 complex to nucleate actin assembly . Of the many proteins involved in this early step of patch formation , two well - studied components that seem to play cen - tral roles are Sla1 and Sla2 . Sla1 binds directly to receptors to promote their internalization by a ubiquitin - independent mechanism ( 156 ) . Sla1 also appears to be important for re - cruiting other factors to patches , as suggested by sla1 (cid:4) muta - tions causing delayed initiation of actin polymerization ( i . e . , stalling in stage 1 ) . Sla1 interacts with Pan1 , End3 ( 364 ) , Las17 FIG . 3 . Electron micrographs of cortical actin patches .

Sla2 localization to patches also requires Scd5 , an essential protein that interacts with early patch components and regulates Glc7 phosphatase activity ( 145 ) . Sla2 is a multidomain protein that makes numerous contri - butions to patch development and function . First , Sla2 may help recruit clathrin to patches , as suggested by the following : ( i ) Sla2 and clathrin colocalizing to early patches ( 266 ) , ( ii ) the mammalian homologue of Sla2 ( Hip1R ) colocalizing with clathrin in vivo and directly promoting assembly of clathrin in vitro ( 94 , 95 ) , and ( iii ) two - hybrid interactions between clathrin and the Sla2 coiled - coil domain ( 144 ) . Second , Sla2 may bind to and regulate Rvs167 , the yeast homologue of amphiphysin . The BAR domains of amphiphysin / Rvs proteins promote membrane curvature to facilitate vesicle budding in endocyto - sis ( 291 ) . Third , Sla2 binds directly to ﬁlamentous actin via its FIG . 4 . Model for actin patch development . ( Step 1 ) Receptors recruit early patch components , including clathrin , adaptors , and two NPFs ( Pan1 and Las17 ) , to the cell cortex to form a relatively immobile complex . ( Step 2 ) Pan1 and Las17 recruit and activate the Arp2 / 3 complex to nucleate actin assembly , leading to slow patch movement at the cortex . During this stage , two additional NPFs are recruited , Abp1 and Myo3 / Myo5 . Abp1 in turn recruits the actin - regulating kinases Ark1 and Prk1 , which phosphorylate Pan1 ( and likely other patch proteins ) . Phosphorylation inhibits Pan1 activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex and triggers dissociation of the Pan1 complex ( Pan1 , End3 , and Sla1 ) . ( Step 3 ) Pan1 phosphorylation and / or the activities of Rvs161 , Rvs167 , and the type I myosins Myo3 and Myo5 promote vesicle scission and internalization . The Arp2 / 3 complex , Abp1 , Sac6 , Cap1 / Cap2 , and likely other patch components maintain association with the internalized vesicle . Some early patch components are left at the cell cortex , including Las17 , Pan1 , Sla1 , Sla2 , Myo3 , and Myo5 . ( Step 4 ) Endocytic vesicles associate with actin cables by an unknown mechanism and move passively with actin cable retrograde ﬂow ( bud to mother ) . ( Step 5 ) Cable - associated vesicles fuse with an endosomal compartment concomitant with disassembly of the actin coat . 610 MOSELEY AND GOODE M ICROBIOL . M OL . B IOL .

Although dele - tion of this domain from Sla2 causes no obvious defects in endocytosis ( 403 , 420 ) , this fragment of Sla2 is required for cell growth and endocytosis in the absence of speciﬁc clathrin adaptors , suggesting an important overlapping role in endocy - tosis ( 20 ) . Thus , it will be interesting to learn if and how Sla2 affects actin dynamics and organization . Fourth , through its amino - terminal AP180 N - terminal homology domain , Sla2 binds to phosphoinositide PI ( 4 , 5 ) P ( PIP 2 ) to facilitate the in - ternalization step of receptor - mediated endocytosis ( 360 ) . Fi - nally , as Sla2 binds to Sla1 ( 18 ) , which in turn binds two NPFs ( Pan1 and Las17 ) , it is possible that Sla2 also contributes to the spatial and temporal regulation of Arp2 / 3 complex activity . ( ii ) Intermediate stage in patch development : slow motility . Transition to the second stage in patch maturation , which likely is coupled to membrane invagination , occurs when early patches ( marked by Las17 , Pan1 , Sla1 , and Sla2 ) are joined by the actin nucleation machinery , consisting of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex and three new NPFs , Abp1 , Myo3 , and Myo5 ( type I myosins ) . Coincident with the detection of ﬁlamentous actin , patches begin to undergo slow , nondirectional movements within the plane of the cortex . These movements are sensitive to Lat - A , suggesting that the transition to this intermediate stage is driven by actin polymerization ( 173 ) . Using mutants stalled at this stage of patch development , the measured rates of actin polymerization were found to be 0 . 05 to 0 . 1 (cid:2) m / s ( 173 , 174 ) , markedly slower than subsequent cable - dependent rapid patch movements ( 0 . 3 (cid:2) m / s ) ( 159 ) . ( iii ) Scission and rapid transport of patches . Transition to the third phase of patch development correlates with the onset of rapid , directional patch motility , in which patches / vesicles move inward from the cell cortex ( 173 ) and simultaneously shed many of their early components ( e . g . , Sla1 , Sla2 , Las17 , Pan1 , Myo3 , and Myo5 ) . The signals that trigger the transition from slow - moving to fast - moving patches are unknown , but based on several lines of evidence , Ark1 / Prk1 kinases are im - plicated . These kinases associate directly with Abp1 and Sla2 to localize to patches and directly phosphorylate Sla1 and Pan1 , and possibly other patch components ( reviewed in ref - erence 355 ) . Phosphorylation of Pan1 by Prk1 inhibits its abil - ity to bind actin and activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 371 ) . Fur - ther , chemically induced loss of Ark1 / Prk1 kinase activity in vivo using analog - sensitive kinase mutants causes the rapid and Arp2 / 3 - dependent formation of actin clumps ( 340 ) . Actin clumps consist of endocytic vesicles that have failed to mature properly and are decorated with Abp1p , Sla2p , Pan1p , Sla1p , and Ent1p . Therefore , Ark1 and Prk1 may negatively regulate the actin assembly - stimulating activity of early endocytic pro - teins and thereby play a critical role in directing vesicle inter - nalization and the onset of rapid patch movements . In addition to regulation of Pan1 by Ark1 and Prk1 kinases , there are likely many other factors that contribute to these events . Las17 is shed prior to Pan1 ( 173 ) , suggesting that Las17 and Pan1 have different roles in vesicle internalization . In addition , mutations in Bbc1 , End3 , Sla1 , and Sla2 ( alone and in combinations ) show formation of dramatic actin protrusions ( 174 ) , suggesting that they may contribute to the down - regu - lation of actin assembly at this stage and / or help promote vesicle release . Consistent with this view , puriﬁed Sla1 and Bbc1 directly bind to and inhibit the NPF activity of Las17 , and sla1 (cid:4) and sla2 (cid:4) cells show defects in patch ultrastructure by EM ( 314 , 315 ) . Deletion of SLA1 results in large , ﬂattened actin patches , and deletion of SLA2 results in large , raised actin patches ( 314 ) . Proper release of vesicles also requires Myo3 , Myo5 , Rvs161 , and Rvs167 , which are implicated in promoting membrane scission ( 172 , 174 ) . Rvs161 and Rvs167 mutants in particular show a striking phenotype where inter - nalizing vesicles are retracted back to the cortex , suggesting a direct role in scission ( 174 ) . Once patches / vesicles leave the cell cortex , they move rap - idly inward along polarized actin cables , structures described in detail below . The retrograde ( bud - to - mother ) ﬂow of cables appears to “carry” patches to endosomal sorting compartments ( 159 ) . The rate of patch transport is similar to the rate of cable ﬂow , suggesting that transport is passive and must involve a physical link between patches and cables ( 159 ) . The only fac - tors known to associate with fast - moving patches are Abp1 , the Arp2 / 3 complex , Cap1 / Cap2 , and Sac6 ( 159 , 173 ) . Whether other known F - actin - associated patch proteins and their li - gands ( e . g . , Cof1 , Crn1 , Srv2 , Scp1 , Twf1 , and Abp140 ) are also present in these patches remains to be determined . Of these factors , Abp140 and Sac6 are strong candidates for pro - viding linkage between patches and cables , since both are known to decorate patches and cables ( 3 , 17 ) . Further , both of these proteins can cross - link actin ﬁlaments in vitro ( 3 , 17 ) , an activity well tailored for bridging two ﬁlamentous actin structures . Finally , some late endosome movements have been reported to require ongoing actin polymerization at the endosome sur - face . These movements were dependent on both the NPF activity of Las17 and Lsb6 ( a Las17 - binding protein ) ( 58 , 59 ) , and the authors suggested that Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin assem - bly powers late endosome movements similar to the mecha - nism employed by Listeria ( see above ) . However , one dilemma with these observations is that Las17 and actin have not been detected on late endosomes , which the authors suggest may be due to their low abundance on such structures . Thus , it remains open whether these actin - dependent movements represent a second , independent class of late endosomes , or instead the defects in late endosome motility in las17 mutants arise from aberrant assembly of endosomes at an earlier stage . Actin Cables : Dynamic Tracks for Polarized Growth Introduction . Unlike animal cells , which rely primarily on microtubule - based transport to establish and maintain cell po - larity ( 353 ) , yeast cells use actin - based transport along cables to direct polarized cell growth and to segregate organelles prior to cell division ( 45 ) . Early in G 1 , unbudded cells detect cortical landmarks remaining from the previous cell division to select a future bud site , and polarity factors ( including the polarity cap ; see below ) are recruited to this end of the cell . From this site , actin cable assembly is initiated , which leads to reorientation of actin cables and thus targeting of growth and secretion to the future bud tip . Polarized growth towards the bud tip ( or cap ) continues through a medium - budded stage and depends on actin cables emanating from the bud tip and neck . These cables serve as polarized tracks for type V myosin - dependent delivery of cargos needed to build the daughter cell . The ﬁrst demonstration that actin cables are required for V OL . 70 , 2006 MECHANISM AND FUNCTION OF THE YEAST ACTIN CYTOSKELETON 611 on N o v e m be r 1 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / mm b r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m polarized cell growth was made possible by using a fast - acting temperature - sensitive tpm1 ts tpm2 (cid:4) mutant strain ( 306 ) . In this work , Pruyne and coworkers showed a complete loss of cables in tpm1 ts tpm2 (cid:4) cells after a 1 - minute incubation at the restric - tive temperature . Cells also rapidly lost the accumulation of a secretory marker ( Sec4 ) and a class V myosin transporter ( Myo2 ) at the bud tip . Remarkably , cables reassembled within 1 minute after their return to the permissive temper - ature , and polarity markers were restored at the bud tip shortly thereafter . Similar phenotypes were observed for the temperature - sensitive myo2 - 66 allele , which carries a muta - tion in its motor domain ( 45 , 171 , 334 ) . From an examina - tion of the literature , it is evident that mutations in most factors known to inﬂuence cable assembly and stability lead to cell polarity defects . These include tropomyosin , Sac6 / ﬁmbrin ( 4 ) , capping protein ( 10 ) , Srv2 ( 385 ) , formins ( 97 , 99 , 325 ) , proﬁlin ( 134 , 410 ) , and Bud6 ( 14 ) . Type V myosin motors ( Myo2 and Myo4 ) transport diverse cargos along actin cables to facilitate polarized growth . Post - Golgi secretory vesicles marked by GFP - Sec4 can be imaged in real time moving directionally on cables towards the bud tip in a Myo2 - dependent manner ( 335 ) . These vesicles carry en - zymes that contribute to the production of new cell wall re - quired for bud growth and cell division ( 1 , 343 ) , including glucan synthase , which localizes to actin patches ( 376 ) . In ad - dition , organelles such as the vacuole , Golgi , nucleus , cortical endoplasmic reticulum , and peroxisomes ( 305 , 421 ) are deliv - ered to the daughter cell in a cable - and Myo2 - dependent manner , and daughter - speciﬁc mRNAs ( e . g . , ASH1 ) are re - tained ( and possibly transported ) in the daughter cell in an actin cable - and Myo4 - dependent manner ( 40 , 72 ) . Finally , mitochondria also appear to be transported along cables , and their anterograde movements occur through a myosin - inde - pendent mechanism that relies on Arp2 / 3 complex - based actin polymerization , reminiscent of Listeria motility ( 104 ) . Mechanism of actin cable formation . Whereas patch forma - tion relies on actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex , cables appear to assemble in an Arp2 / 3 - independent manner ( 99 , 407 ) . Until recent years , it had been speculated that cables might be assembled by a mechanism of ﬁlament capture and incorporation , similar to what was proposed for the assembly of actomyosin rings and the bundled actin structures in Dro - sophila melanogaster bristles . However , recent studies show that cables are assembled by the actin - nucleating activity of formins and proﬁlin . Two key observations led to this discov - ery . First , it was shown that the formins Bni1 and Bnr1 are acutely required for cable assembly ( 99 , 325 ) , consistent with their localization to sites from which cables emanate ( 182 , 284 , 304 ) ( Fig . 5A ) . When conditional bni1 ts bnr1 (cid:4) mutant cells were shifted to the nonpermissive temperature , all visible actin cables disappeared within 2 min ( Fig . 5B ) , and cables reap - peared within 2 to 4 min upon return to the permissive tem - perature ( 99 , 325 ) . Second , biochemical analyses demonstrated that puriﬁed carboxyl - terminal fragments of Bni1 directly nu - cleate actin assembly in vitro ( 303 , 326 ) . These papers inspired studies on formin activity in other species , and it is now evident that actin assembly - promoting activity is a universal property and function of all formins examined in animals , plants , and fungi ( 149 , 194 ) . Despite these advances , key questions remain regarding ca - ble formation . How are the potent actin nucleation activities of Bni1 and Bnr1 regulated ? Studies in mammalian cells suggest that formins are auto - inhibited until released by binding of activated Rho family GTPases to the formin Rho - binding do - main ( 389 ) ; however , it has not been determined if Bni1 and / or Bnr1 are auto - inhibited . In yeast , there is evidence to suggest that Cdc42 contributes to formin regulation during early bud emergence and then the partially redundant Rho3 and Rho4 regulate formins during most phases of cell growth , whereas Rho1 may regulate formins in response to cell stresses ( 79 ) . The speciﬁc molecular mechanism underlying this in vivo con - trol remains to be deﬁned . Do Cdc42 , Rho1 , Rho3 , and Rho4 all act by binding to Bni1 and Bnr1 to relieve a proposed auto - inhibited state ? Do they act speciﬁcally on Bni1 or Bnr1 ? Are other factors required for activating formins ? How are Bni1 and Bnr1 functions regulated by phosphorylation ( 122 , 235 ) ? Once nucleated , how are actin ﬁlaments spatially orga - nized into cables ? Is this mediated by the proteins that deco - FIG . 5 .

Shifting mutants from the permissive temperature ( 23°C , left panel ) to the nonpermissive temperature ( 35°C , right panel ) for 2 to 4 min results in complete loss of visible actin cables but does not affect actin patch distribution in budded ( b ) or unbudded ( u ) cells .

The bud tip polarity cap . The term “polarity cap” refers to a group of interacting cellular factors that localize primarily to the bud tip during bud emergence and growth and have genetic roles in directing polarized cell growth . Subsequently , many of the polarity cap components shift localization to the bud neck , just prior to cell division , where they appear to facilitate cyto - kinesis by mechanisms described in the next section . Some polarity cap components help to promote cable assembly , as discussed below , while others regulate dynamic membrane trafﬁcking events ( exocytosis and endocytosis ) and additional aspects of cell polarity at the bud tip ; for more details see other recent reviews ( 54 , 138 , 157 , 302 ) . One functional complex within the polarity cap network has been referred to as the polarisome . Its three components— Spa2 , Pea2 , and Bud6—comigrate as part of a 12S complex in cell extracts fractionated by sedimentation velocity ( 345 ) . In addition , the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 and two Cdc42 effec - tors , Bni1 and Gic2 , appear to function intimately with the polarisome , as supported by numerous two - hybrid and coim - munoprecipitation interactions with Spa2 , Pea2 , and Bud6 ( 97 , 113 , 169 ) . Dozens of other components now are routinely referred to as part of the polarity cap network based on their physical interactions and localization pattern to the bud tip . The concept of a large macromolecular assemblage directing polarized cell growth raises a number of interesting questions . First , what are all the components ? To date , at least 60 pro - teins have been identiﬁed that localize to the bud tip , most of which show physical and / or genetic interactions that suggest their involvement in regulating polarity ( 165 ) . Undoubtedly , this list will continue to grow . Second , are there stable sub - complexes within the larger assemblage ? As mentioned above , at least one stable complex has been identiﬁed , containing Spa2 , Pea2 , and Bud6 , and there is evidence that this same complex may contain Gic2 ( 169 ) and possibly the Spa2 - related protein Sph1 ( 16 , 319 ) . Greater efforts are required now to isolate biochemically and deﬁne by mass spectrometry the components of this and other bud tip complexes . Third , how are the interactions among complexes and components spa - tially and temporally regulated ? As has proven to be the case for other large biological machines ( e . g . , kinetochore , centro - some , and spliceosome ) , there are likely to be stable subcom - plexes as well as dynamically interacting components . Speciﬁc components may change interactions in response to molecular signals . Two kinases that regulate cell polarity are implicated in phosphorylating Bni1 , a central ﬁgure in the polarisome be - cause of its role in nucleating actin assembly . Bni1 is phosphor - ylated directly by Fus3 kinase and is phosphorylated in a Ste20 kinase - dependent manner in vivo ( 122 , 235 ) . The Bni1 - inter - acting protein Bud6 is phosphorylated ( 251 ) ; further , it asso - ciates with Ste11 ( a MEK kinase ) , which regulates polarity ( 251 , 345 ) . In addition , Bni1 , Gic2 , and the PAK - like kinases Ste20 and Cla4 are directly regulated by interactions with Rho GTPases ( 169 , 170 ) . These provide inspiring leads into the mechanisms regulating polarity cap assembly and function but also likely represent only a small percentage of the total sig - naling events involved . A more daunting question , and one that will likely require combined efforts from many laboratories to answer , is what are the activities of each component in the polarity cap network ? Some of the relevant activities to address include the following : ( i ) maintaining association of other components at the cortex , ( ii ) providing signals to direct localized assembly of actin ca - bles , and ( iii ) receiving positive feedback signals that help sustain polarity . Several polarity cap components ( Bud6 , Cdc42 , Rho3 , Rho4 , and proﬁlin ) are thought to regulate Bni1 directly to promote actin cable assembly ( see below ) . In addi - tion , Spa2 directly interacts with Bni1 and Pea2 ( 113 , 345 ) , and Spa2 and Pea2 are required for Bni1 localization ( 284 ) . The biochemical activity of Gic2 is unknown , but it binds to Cdc42 ( 47 , 60 ) and interacts with Bud6 in the yeast two - hybrid assay ( 169 , 170 ) , it contributes to localization of Bni1 and Bud6 in early bud emergence ( 169 ) , and gic1 gic2 mutants show defects in establishment of polarity early in bud emergence ( 47 , 60 ) . Since Bud6 regulates Bni1 activity ( 253 ) , it will be interesting to determine if Gic2 binds directly to Bud6 and whether Bud6 - Gic2 interactions inﬂuence actin assembly . With these and other data in mind , we have constructed a working model for the polarity cap , focused on its role in promoting actin cable assembly ( Fig . 6 ) . Future models will need to incorporate mechanisms for secretory vesicle docking and fusion , other membrane remodeling events , and cell wall synthesis . In addition , a clear picture of polarity cap architec - ture and function eventually will require deﬁning ( i ) the rela - tive abundances of each component , ( ii ) the stable protein complexes formed among components , ( iii ) the rules for hier - archical assembly and localization of components at the bud tip , and ( iv ) functional interactions linking different nodes of the polarity network ( e . g . , bud site selection , Rho signaling , actin cable assembly , the exocyst complex , secretory apparatus , cell wall synthesis , RAM [ r egulation of A ce2p activity and cellular m orphogenesis ] signaling , and mitogen - activated pro - tein kinase signaling ) ( 165 ) . For instance , Msb3 and Msb4 appear to coordinate multiple functions in polarized cell growth , including regulating the activity of the GTPase Sec4 in exocytosis , binding to the central polarity cap factor Spa2 , and controlling Cdc42 activity ( 366 ) . Actin cable architecture . Cables must provide polarized tracks for continuous myosin - dependent transport of cargos to the bud neck and tip . Therefore , early models suggested that cables might be stable structures , comprised of long bundled actin ﬁlaments , providing relatively stationary tracks for myosin movement . However , it is now evident that cables are comprised of shorter ﬁlaments organized into bundles of uniform polarity , with the majority of their fast - growing ( barbed ) ends oriented towards polarity sites . Evidence for this organization includes the following : ( i ) a single ﬂuores - cently labeled cable has variations in its width , suggesting the thicker regions may be zones of intense ﬁlament overlap ; ( ii ) cables are decorated with two known actin ﬁlament - bundling proteins , Sac6 and Abp140 ( 17 , 84 ) ; ( iii ) myosin V - dependent transport is unidirectional towards polarity sites ( 335 ) , and yeast type V myosins ( Myo2 and Myo4 ) are barbed end - directed motors ( 310 ) ; and ﬁnally , ( iv ) formins associate with the barbed ends of actin ﬁlaments and local - ize to the bud tip and neck . The precise arrangement of actin ﬁlaments in S . cerevisiae cables remains uncertain , because cables traverse multiple planes within a cell and have eluded description by thin - section EM and tomogra - V OL . 70 , 2006 MECHANISM AND FUNCTION OF THE YEAST ACTIN CYTOSKELETON 613 on N o v e m be r 1 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / mm b r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m phy . However , the recent use of permeabilized cells for EM in S . pombe has revealed that actin cables are comprised of short overlapping ﬁlaments with most of the barbed ends oriented towards the cell tips , consistent with facilitation of barbed end - directed myosin movement ( 175 ) . Given all of the points above , it seems likely that S . cerevisiae cables will show a similar organization . Gone in 60 seconds : actin cables are composed of short ﬁlaments . Intriguingly , actin cables are lost within 60 seconds of treating cells with the actin monomer - sequestering drug FIG . 6 . Models for regulation of actin cable assembly at the bud tip and neck . ( A ) Organization of formins ( red ) , actin cables ( gold ) , and septin structures ( blue ) in a budded yeast cell . Formin proteins ( Bni1 at the bud tip and Bnr1 at the neck ) directly nucleate actin cable formation . Septins serve as a diffusion barrier between bud and mother cell compartments and provide a scaffold for assembly of many bud neck components . ( B ) Interaction network at the bud neck : septins ( blue ) ; actin ( tan ) ; actin - binding proteins ( red ) ; all other factors ( green ) . Solid lines represent known physical interactions ; dashed lines denote septin - dependent localization . In G 1 / S , septins recruit other early components to the bud neck . Later in the cell cycle , just prior to cytokinesis , additional factors ( late components ) are recruited to the bud neck , including components of the bud tip “polarity cap” complex . ( C ) Model for regulation of actin cable assembly by polarity cap components at the bud tip and cable disassembly by coﬁlin and Aip1 . The polarity cap may be linked to the plasma membrane via components that directly associate with phospholipids , including Cdc42 , Cdc24 , and Cla4 . The actin ﬁlaments in cables are nucleated by the formin Bni1 , using proﬁlin - and Bud6 - bound actin subunits as substrates . Bni1 activity may be regulated by interactions with Cdc42 , Rho3 , Rho4 , Bud6 , proﬁlin , Spa2 , and other factors ( not pictured ) . Bni1 associates tightly with the fast - growing ( barbed ) end of the actin ﬁlament it nucleates , facilitating insertional growth while protecting ends from capping protein ( Cap1 / 2 ) . Cables are likely comprised of short staggered ﬁlaments connected by actin cross - linking proteins , such as Sac6 and Abp140 . It is not yet clear what regulates the lengths of actin ﬁlaments within a cable . Cables are stabilized along their sides by tropomyosin , which competes with coﬁlin for binding F - actin . Genetic observations also suggest that Bni1 and Cap1 / 2 might cap the barbed ends of ﬁlaments in cables ( see text ) . As rapidly as cables are formed , they must be disassembled , which recent evidence suggests is mediated by coﬁlin and Aip1 . Barbed - end - directed type V myosins ( Myo2 and Myo4 ) transport vesicles , organelles , and other cargos along cables to the bud tip . 614 MOSELEY AND GOODE M ICROBIOL . M OL . B IOL . R EV . on N o v e m be r 1 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / mm b r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Lat - A ( 19 ) . This ﬁnding demonstrates two important proper - ties . First , the ﬁlaments in cables likely undergo rapid turnover , as Lat - A sequesters monomers to inhibit new actin assembly but is not reported to promote ﬁlament disassembly . Second , due to the rapid nature of cable loss , the ﬁlaments in cables must be relatively short . In fact , their approximate length can be estimated from their disassembly rate using the following simple calculations . A typical large - budded yeast cell is (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) m long , with actin cables (cid:3) 4 (cid:2) m long . Each actin subunit within a ﬁlament contributes 2 . 77 nm to ﬁlament length ( 155 ) , so if this 4 - (cid:2) m cable is comprised of a single linear ﬁlament , it contains (cid:3) 1 , 500 subunits . The barbed end of this ﬁlament may be capped by formins ( see below ) , but to make a more liberal estimate of ﬁlament length we will assume that both ﬁlament ends are uncapped . Using the dissociation rates for rabbit skeletal muscle ADP - actin ( 7 . 2 s (cid:5) 1 for the barbed end , 0 . 27 s (cid:5) 1 for the pointed end ) and ATP - actin ( 1 . 4 s (cid:5) 1 for the barbed end , 0 . 8 s (cid:5) 1 for the pointed end ) ( 293 ) , a 4 - (cid:2) m ﬁlament ( 1 , 500 subunits long ) would lose about 450 subunits in 1 minute if composed entirely of ADP - actin or 130 subunits for all ATP - actin . In either case , a 4 - (cid:2) m - long ﬁlament in a cable would maintain most of its length after 1 minute of Lat - A treatment , instead of the observed complete loss of cable staining ( 19 ) . Thus , an extremely conservative estimate of average ﬁlament length in cables is (cid:6) 1 (cid:2) m . These estimations do not consider the stabilizing and destabilizing effects of actin - binding pro - teins that decorate the sides of cables . Nonetheless , these es - timates for S . cerevisiae are remarkably consistent with the measured lengths of ﬁlaments ( 0 . 4 to 0 . 5 (cid:2) m ) in S . pombe cables as determined by EM ( 175 ) . This still leaves many open questions concerning cable reg - ulation . How is the length of ﬁlaments in cables controlled ? The extent of ﬁlament elongation could be restricted by cap - ping proteins . While no conventional barbed or pointed end capping proteins have been visualized on cables , it is possible their decoration is sparse ( since they associate only with ﬁla - ment ends ) and thus has escaped detection . Cap1 / Cap2 ( yeast capping protein ) , which associates tightly with ﬁlament barbed ends to block both addition and dissociation of subunits , is a strong candidate to be on cables , because cap2 (cid:4) cells exhibit dramatically reduced cables ( 10 ) . This phenotype is consistent with Cap1 / Cap2 having a role in stabilizing the ﬁlaments in cables . Formins also bind tightly to barbed ends but permit ﬁlament growth through a processive capping mechanism and protect growing ends from Cap1 / Cap2 ( 253 , 429 ) . Thus , formins may initiate actin nucleation at the bud tip but remain associated with ﬁlaments as they are incorporated into cables . Consistent with this model , actin cables undergo retrograde ﬂow away from the cortical sites of polarized growth ( see below ) , and formin - GFP punctae have been visualized on mov - ing actin cables in S . cerevisiae and S . pombe ( D . Pellman and F . Chang , personal communications ) . Thus , the capped state of ﬁlaments in cables is an important issue to resolve and raises even more questions : are formins present on all or a subset of ﬁlaments in cables ? Is Cap1 / Cap2 present on some ﬁlaments ? Do ﬁlaments initially have formins associated , but then Cap1 / Cap2 displaces them ? If so , what regulates these dynamics ? Some of the issues may be resolved by emerging advances in light microscopy , which may allow detection of a few ( even single ) molecules decorating actin ﬁlament ends in vivo . Another possibility to consider is that ﬁlaments in cables may be capped at their pointed ends . Tropomodulins perform this function in vertebrate muscle and nonmuscle cells , tightly capping the pointed ends of tropomyosin - decorated ﬁlaments ( 108 ) . Although obvious tropomodulin homologues have not been identiﬁed in the S . cerevisiae genome , functional homo - logues may exist , mutants of which likely would cause dimin - ished cables . Actin cable dynamics and turnover . The observed rapid turnover of cables suggests that there may be active mecha - nisms required for disassembling the ﬁlaments comprising ca - bles . However , in wild - type cells , the primary ﬁlament disas - sembly factor , coﬁlin , is not detected on cables . Instead , cables are decorated with tropomyosin , which stabilizes ﬁlaments and competes with coﬁlin for binding F - actin ( 30 , 278 ) . These ob - servations have left the high rate of cable turnover unex - plained ; however , two studies provide insights into possible turnover mechanisms . First , coﬁlin was shown to decorate ca - bles in aip1 (cid:4) cells ( 317 ) . Second , coﬁlin and Aip1 were dem - onstrated to promote rapid cable turnover ( 276 ) , with cof1 - 22 and aip1 (cid:4) mutations causing (cid:3) 20 - and 5 - fold decreases in the rate of cable turnover , respectively . This work suggests that most ﬁlaments in cables are decorated and stabilized by tropo - myosins Tpm1 and Tpm2 , but subsets of ﬁlaments are stochas - tically and rapidly disassembled by the combined activities of coﬁlin and Aip1 ( see “Rapid Turnover of Actin Structures” for more details ) . This leads to a steady thinning or “pruning” of cables along their lengths . Given the discovery of this function for coﬁlin and Aip1 , other factors known to promote ﬁlament disassembly and turnover should be tested for their roles in cable turnover ( e . g . , Srv2 / CAP , proﬁlin , and twinﬁlin ) . Using Abp140 - GFP as a marker , Yang and Pon have imaged actin cable dynamics in real time in live cells ( 419 ) . Their work shows that for many cables , one end associates with the bud tip or bud neck while the other end moves away from these as - sembly sites ( in the direction of the mother cell ) at (cid:3) 0 . 3 (cid:2) m / s . Some cables appear to assemble at the bud tip and extend through the bud neck into the mother compartment . Other cables appear to move along the cell cortex without having one end attached to the bud tip or bud neck . It is not yet clear whether these “free - roaming” cables have distinct functions and whether they are initially assembled at the bud tip and neck and detach from those sites , or instead form independent of the polarity sites . The direction of cable ﬂow ( retrograde , away from the bud tip ) is somewhat unexpected given that cables serve as tracks for myosin V - based barbed end - directed transport in the opposite direction ( anterograde , toward the bud neck and tip ) . However , retrograde cable ﬂow ( 0 . 3 (cid:2) m / s ) does not appear to pose a major difﬁculty to overcome , since myosin V - dependent anterograde transport is about 10 times faster—4 . 5 (cid:2) m / s in vitro ( 310 ) and 3 (cid:2) m / s in vivo ( 335 ) . What provides the force that drives cables away from the bud tip and neck and toward the mother cell ? One possible answer is the force generated by actin polymerization . As formins polymerize actin ﬁlaments at the bud tip and neck , these elongating ﬁlaments may be pushed into the mother cell due to insertional polymerization at their barbed ends capped by Bni1 and Bnr1 ( 197 , 251 , 253 , 429 ) . If cable ﬂow rate ( 0 . 3 (cid:2) m / s ) were directly proportional to actin polymerization rate , V OL . 70 , 2006 MECHANISM AND FUNCTION OF THE YEAST ACTIN CYTOSKELETON 615 on N o v e m be r 1 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / mm b r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m this would require ﬁlament elongation rates of (cid:3) 100 sub - units / s . This would require 5 - to 10 - (cid:2) M monomeric actin in the cytosol , which is unlikely to exist . However , interactions be - tween proﬁlin , actin monomers , and the formins Bni1 and Bnr1 may accelerate cable assembly rates to match rapid cable ﬂow rates ( see “Proﬁlin - FH1 interactions : a throttle for ﬁla - ment elongation” below ) . In addition , cable ﬂow rates are likely inﬂuenced by cellular mechanisms beyond actin polymerization , including a mecha - nism recently suggested to involve myosin . Domain and se - quence similarities among myosin heavy chains deﬁne myosin classes , also called types ( 200 , 400 ) . S . cerevisiae expresses ﬁve myosins : two type V myosins ( Myo2 and Myo4 ) that transport secretory vesicles , organelles , and mRNAs to sites of polarized growth ( bud tip and neck ) ; a single type II myosin ( Myo1 ) that promotes formation and closure of the cytokinetic ring ; and two type I myosins ( Myo3 and Myo5 ) that promote actin as - sembly and endocytosis at cortical patches ( 22 , 126 , 305 ) . Re - cent work suggests that Myo1 has an important role in con - trolling actin cable dynamics ( T . Huckaba and L . Pon , personal communication ) . Myo1 ﬁrst localizes to the incipient bud site early in G 1 ( 33 , 204 , 362 ) and then is found at the bud neck from the earliest stages of bud formation . Although Myo1 is thought to function primarily in cytokinesis , much later in the cell cycle , Huckaba and colleagues observe reduced cable ve - locities in the absence of Myo1 motor activity . They propose that Myo1 , situated at the bud neck , uses its barbed end - directed motor to “pull” cables through the bud neck and facilitate directional ﬂow toward the mother cell . Thus , cable movement may be regulated by actin polymerization , Myo1 activity , and possibly other factors . Yeast Cytokinesis : Two Complementary Mechanisms for Cell Division Introduction . Virtually all animals and fungi utilize an actin - based contractile ring to physically separate the two daughter cells during cytokinesis . Although a cytokinetic actin ring had been observed in ﬁssion yeast as early as 1986 ( 231 ) , the exis - tence of such a division mechanism in budding yeast was real - ized only in recent years . Early work suggested an enrichment of actin at the site of cell division in yeast ( 2 , 183 ) , but an actomyosin contractile ring was not observed until 1998 ( 34 , 217 ) . In animal cells , myosin II controls contraction of the actin cytokinetic ring ( 105 ) , which constricts the cleavage furrow to a 1 - to 2 - (cid:2) m - wide midbody zone ( 258 , 308 , 327 ) . In S . cerevi - siae , the bud neck is less than 1 (cid:2) m throughout the cell cycle ; this led to the suggestion that constriction would not occur in yeast and , instead , that targeting of secretory vesicles for mem - brane and cell wall deposition to the bud neck would be suf - ﬁcient to drive cell division ( 327 ) . This view was reinforced by the observation that the single budding yeast type II myosin , Myo1 , localizes to the bud neck throughout the cell cycle ( 394 ) , suggesting that Myo1 may have more of a structural role rather than a dynamic role at the bud neck . Further , since some yeast strains lacking MYO1 were shown to be viable and complete cytokinesis , its role in cytokinesis re - mained dubious ( 34 , 318 , 395 ) . Then , in 1998 , two seminal studies imaged Myo1 - GFP dynamics in live cells and pro - vided clear evidence that a myosin ring contracts speciﬁcally during cytokinesis ( Fig . 7 ) ( 34 , 217 ) . It is now evident that two complementary mechanisms con - tribute to yeast cytokinesis : ﬁrst , contraction of an actomyosin ring , and second , formation of a septum , achieved by delivery of secretory vesicles to the bud neck to facilitate membrane deposition and cell wall synthesis . It remains unclear how these two mechanisms are coordinated , as discussed below . The position of actin ring assembly ( and the future plane of cell division ) in budding yeast is dictated by the position of bud emergence initiated in early G 1 , where the ring will be assem - bled at the neck of the newly growing bud ( 54 , 302 , 305 ) . The bud site is selected by cortical cues ( bud site selection markers ) remaining from the previous cell division . Early in G 1 , these positional cues trigger recruitment and activation of a cascade of factors essential for assembling both the polarity cap at the incipient bud tip and components of the bud neck . At the top of this hierarchy of bud neck components are the septins , which form a ring structure discussed in detail below . Through poorly understood mechanisms , this scaffold in turn recruits FIG . 7 . Formation and contraction of an acto - myosin ring during yeast cytokinesis . ( A ) Prior to cytokinesis , actin ﬁlaments ( rhodamine - phalloidin ) and type II myosin ( Myo1 - GFP ) assemble at the bud neck . ( B ) The actomyosin ring contracts , as demonstrated in consecutive frames of a Myo1 - GFP time course at 1 - minute intervals . Bar , 2 (cid:2) m .

All of these factors arrive at the bud neck before visible actin staining with the exception of Cyk3 , which appears during anaphase . During anaphase , two separate F - actin structures appear at the bud neck , both of which contribute to cell division . First , actin cables become reorganized such that they are polarized towards the bud neck in both the mother and the daughter cell compartments , directing all secretion to the division plane ( 305 ) . This transition is marked by a dramatic shift of polarity markers ( e . g . , Cdc42 , Bni1 , Spa2 , and Sec3 ) from the bud tip to the bud neck , although the mechanism regulating relocation of these factors is unknown . These events lead to membrane and cell wall deposition at the bud neck to form the septum , dis - cussed in more detail below . Second , an F - actin ring forms , which constricts in a Myo1 - dependent manner to help close the neck ( 34 , 217 ) . The actin ﬁlaments in the cables and the ring are highly dynamic , as both are sensitive to treatment of cells with Lat - A ( 19 , 34 , 369 ) . These observations raise many important questions , in - cluding the following . What are the signals at anaphase that induce cable reorientation and actin ring assembly at the neck ? What is the architecture of ﬁlaments in the ring ? What are the signals that trigger ring contraction ? How are the activities of cables and the ring coordinated to facilitate cell division ? Each of these issues is discussed in greater detail in the following sections . Targeting secretion to the bud neck at cytokinesis . Prior to anaphase , polarized actin cables are assembled at two loca - tions , the bud tip ( where Bni1 localizes ) and the bud neck ( where Bnr1 localizes ) . This produces two sets of cables that together target secretion to the bud tip . At anaphase , Bni1 abruptly changes localization , joining Bnr1 at the bud neck ( 176 , 284 , 304 ) . In a similar time frame , other components of the polarity cap , such as Spa2 and Bud6 , change localization from the bud tip to the bud neck ( 14 , 345 ) . These events redirect secretion to the bud neck , as indicated by relocation to the neck of Myo2 , Mlc1 , and exocytosis markers such as Sec3 and components of the exocyst complex ( 305 ) . Targeted deliv - ery of new plasma membrane and cell wall materials provides additional surface area required for cell division . Other key factors delivered to the neck include Chs2 and Chs3 , the cat - alytic subunits of chitin synthase II and chitin synthase III . Chs2 contributes to formation of the primary septum , while Chs3 functions primarily in bud scar chitin synthesis ; however , these two enzymes appear to share an essential role in septum formation ( 63 , 343 ) . chs2 (cid:4) and chs3 (cid:4) cells are viable but show defects in septum formation and cell division , and chs2 (cid:4) chs3 (cid:4) double mutants are inviable and arrest at cytokinesis ( 343 ) . This demonstrates an essential role for targeted septum depo - sition and cell wall synthesis in cytokinesis . Remarkably , these secretion - driven pathways are sufﬁcient for completing cytoki - nesis in the absence of a contractile actin ring , albeit not as efﬁciently , suggesting that they make the dominant contribu - tion to cell division . Formation and closure of the actomyosin ring . Actin ﬁla - ments are among the ﬁnal components to be assembled into the contractile ring and do not become visible until late ana - phase . Early models , based on genetic evidence that the Arp2 / 3 complex is not required for actomyosin ring formation ( 408 ) , suggested that preformed ﬁlaments may be recruited to the bud neck in order to form the ring ( 105 ) . However , more - recent evidence suggests that ongoing actin assembly by Bni1 and Bnr1 is required for ring formation and function . While the actin ring forms in either bni1 (cid:4) or bnr1 (cid:4) single mutants ( 378 ) , a temperature - sensitive formin mutant strain ( bni1 ts bni1 (cid:4) ) fails to assemble the ring ( 369 ) . Other factors required for ring assembly include proﬁlin and tropomyosin ( 369 ) . Thus , the machinery driving ring formation is highly similar to that driving cable assembly . In S . pombe , formins are essential for actin ring formation and cytokinesis ( 57 ) , but the Arp2 / 3 com - plex also localizes to the actomyosin ring and makes a contri - bution to its formation ( 288 ) , possibly by promoting endocy - tosis to facilitate septum formation . In contrast , actin ring formation in S . cerevisiae is thought to occur independently of the Arp2 / 3 complex , and to date the Arp2 / 3 complex has not been localized to the actin ring . Despite this prevailing model , two regulators of the Arp2 / 3 complex , Las17 and Vrp1 , have known roles in cytokinesis ( 265 , 367 ) , and actin structures that depend on Arp2 / 3 complex activity have been observed at the bud neck ( 270 ) , leaving open many possibilities for the mech - anism of their involvement . Three questions regarding the behavior of the assembled actin ring point to important issues for future investigation . First , how are actin ﬁlaments in the ring organized ? A require - ment for actin polymerization by formins suggests that ﬁla - ments should be unbranched . Further , the classic “purse string” model for ring contraction predicts a network of ﬁla - ments with antiparallel arrangement to facilitate myosin - based contraction ( 109 ) . Resolving this will require ultrastructural analysis of partially puriﬁed actomyosin rings and / or intact rings in cells . Second , what is the mechanism driving actin ring contraction ? One possibility is the motor activity of yeast type II myosin ( Myo1 ) . Indeed , a point mutation impairing F - actin binding of the Myo1 motor domain causes cytokinesis defects ( T . Huckaba and L . Pon , personal communication ) . However , deletion of the entire motor domain of Myo1 causes no de - tectable defects in cytokinesis ( 224 ) . While these data appear to be at odds , perhaps instead they suggest that the Myo1 motor domain contributes to force production during cytoki - nesis but can be replaced by other cellular factors ( possibly other myosins ) when deleted . Another possibility is that non - motor activities of Myo1 promote ring closure . Recent work in mammalian cells suggests that type II myosin promotes acto - myosin ring disassembly rather than contraction ( 133 , 263 ) . Myo1 may employ a similar mechanism to facilitate cytokine - sis , but this model awaits testing . It will also be important to identify the signals that regulate Myo1 activity ( and thus the timing of ring contraction ) . Third , how are actin ﬁlaments in the dynamic actomyosin ring disassembled ? Myo1 may con - tribute to disassembly , as discussed above , but additional fac - tors are likely involved ; one example is coﬁlin , which functions at the cytokinetic ring in S . pombe ( 264 ) . Clearly , we have much to learn about how the many ring components that promote actin ﬁlament assembly ( e . g . , formins , proﬁlin ) , sta - bilization ( e . g . , tropomyosin , Sac6 ) , and turnover ( e . g . , coﬁlin ) are exquisitely regulated to control ring formation and con - traction . V OL . 70 , 2006 MECHANISM AND FUNCTION OF THE YEAST ACTIN CYTOSKELETON 617 on N o v e m be r 1 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / mm b r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Role of yeast myosin light chains in cytokinesis . All myosins are comprised of both heavy and light chains . The heavy chains are large polypeptides ( typically 100 to 200 kDa ) with a motor domain , multiple IQ motifs , and variable tail regions . The light chains are small polypeptides ( (cid:3) 15 kDa ) with a calmodulin - like fold that bind to IQ motifs in heavy chains to facilitate motor activity . Further , calcium binding and / or phosphoryla - tion of light chains can regulate their association with heavy chains , providing cells with a mechanism for controlling myosin activity . S . cerevisiae expresses ﬁve myosin heavy chains ( Myo1 , Myo2 , Myo3 , Myo4 , and Myo5 ) and three light chains ( Mlc1 , Mlc2 , and the calmodulin Cmd1 ) . Below , we focus on their roles in cytokinesis through interactions with Myo1 and Myo2 . Like all type II myosins , Myo1 has an essential light chain ( Mlc1 ) ( 227 ) and a regulatory light chain ( Mlc2 ) ( 33 ) . Differ - ences in the functions of the light chains are apparent from their distinct patterns of localization and mutant phenotypes . Mlc2 colocalizes with Myo1 at the bud neck and requires Myo1 for localization ( 227 ) . In contrast , Mlc1 localizes to the bud neck independently of Myo1 ( 342 ) . Deletion of MLC2 has little effect on cell growth or cytokinesis but causes a slight delay in Myo1 ring disassembly ( 227 ) . In contrast , MLC1 is essential for cytokinesis and cell viability ( 33 ) . Since myo1 (cid:4) cells are viable and can undergo cytokinesis , the lethality of mlc1 (cid:4) suggests that it performs additional functions beyond regulating Myo1 . This is further suggested by disruption of Mlc1 - Myo1 interactions with speciﬁc point mutations in Mlc1 or deletion of the IQ motifs in Myo1 , both of which cause only mild phenotypes ( 227 ) . What then is the primary Mlc1 function ( s ) in cytokinesis ? Mlc1 binds to at least two other proteins at the bud neck that promote cytokinesis , Myo2 ( 358 ) and Iqg1 / Cyk1 ( IQGAP ) ( 342 ) . Its interaction with Myo2 targets vesicles to ﬁll the bud neck , a key step in formation of the septum ( 388 ) . However , removal of all six IQ motifs from Myo2 ( i . e . , the myo2 - (cid:4) 6IQ mutant ) does not affect growth or division rates ( 358 ) , indicat - ing that the Mlc1 - Myo2 interaction is not essential for motor function and likely serves primarily in a regulatory capacity . Mlc1 interactions with Iqg1 may have multiple roles . Iqg1 requires Mlc1 for its localization to and function in assembling the cytokinetic ring ( 96 , 341 ) . Iqg1 also has been implicated in promoting septum formation ( 280 ) , which could require its interactions with Mlc1 and is consistent with the IQG1 gene being essential ( 96 ) . Thus , Mlc1 appears to coordinate both actin - based pathways facilitating cytokinesis : ( i ) polarized transport of vesicles to form the septum and ( ii ) formation and closure of the actomyosin ring . One key open question is how Mlc1 localization is regulated , since there are no known li - gands of Mlc1 that it depends on for its localization to the ring . Coordinating septum formation with actin ring contraction . Cytokinesis is driven by two parallel pathways ( targeted vesicle delivery and ring assembly and closure ) which are genetically separable and are regulated by a large number of proteins found at the bud neck ( 121 ) . The temporal sensitivity and complexity of these two pathways suggest that they must be coordinated ; however , the mechanisms for this remain poorly understood . One family of proteins that may be involved is the formins ( Bni1 and Bnr1 ) , as they directly nucleate the actin structures required in both pathways : actin cables and rings . Their regulation—particularly by Rho - GTPases—may play a key role in this process . Rho1 , but not Cdc42 , is required for actin ring formation , and the requirement for Rho1 is over - come by expression of a dominant - active Bni1 construct ( 369 ) . This suggests that Rho1 functions upstream of Bni1 to stim - ulate actin ring assembly . Functions for other yeast Rho GTPases during cytokinesis remain untested . Another strong candidate for coordinating septum forma - tion with contractile ring function is Hof1 / Cyk2 , a member of the cdc15 / PSTPIP family of proteins ( 216 ) . Deletion of HOF1 / CYK2 causes temperature - sensitive growth and leads to defects in both septum formation and ring contraction at the nonper - missive temperature ( 215 , 378 ) . Hof1 localizes to the bud neck independent of Myo1 ( 215 , 378 ) and contracts only partially during cell division ( unlike Myo1 ) ( 215 , 378 ) , and hof1 and myo1 deletions are synthetic lethal ( 378 ) . These observations indicate that Hof1 and Myo1 perform distinct functions in cytokinesis and suggest that Hof1 may function in septum formation . Hof1 physically interacts with Bnr1 , suggesting it may regulate cable assembly at the bud neck . Further , another member of the cdc15 / PSTPIP protein family , S . pombe Cdc15p , interacts with both the cytokinetic formin Cdc12p and the Arp2 / 3 - activating type I myosin ( 53 ) . The genetic data implicating Hof1 in septum formation , along with physical interactions of Cdc15 and Hof1 with actin polymerization ma - chinery , together suggest that these proteins may link and coordinate actomyosin ring formation / contraction with septum formation . These processes may be facilitated by the ability of cdc15 / PSTPIP proteins to associate with and deform mem - branes via their conserved FCH domains ( 166 , 372 ) . A third factor to consider , Cyk3 , localizes to the bud neck , shows genetic interactions similar to those of Hof1 ( e . g . , syn - thetic lethal with myo1 ) ( 193 ) , and has been proposed to func - tion with Hof1 in septum formation ( 33 ) . Overexpression of either CYK3 or HOF1 suppresses the lethality of iqg1 (cid:4) ( 193 ) , suggesting that CYK3 and HOF1 may act downstream or are redundant with IQG1 . Further , cyk3 (cid:4) and hof1 (cid:4) mutations are synthetic lethal , suggesting that they may perform separate functions downstream of Iqg1 ( 193 ) . Septins . The molecular machinery that assembles the acto - myosin contractile ring and the septum must be targeted to the bud neck . The timing of arrival and loss of different compo - nents at the bud neck varies greatly throughout the cell cycle ( 121 ) , and the mechanisms for recruitment and maintenance of localization of these proteins are just beginning to emerge . Some of the earliest proteins to arrive are the septins ( includ - ing Cdc3 , Cdc10 , Cdc11 , and Cdc12 in budding yeast ) , which in turn are required for localization of many other proteins ( 222 ) . Septins are ubiquitous GTP - binding proteins that form stable heteromeric complexes ; these units assemble tandemly into 10 - nm - wide ﬁlaments that can be organized further into poly - mer systems ( 106 , 187 ) . Septin ﬁlaments in cells were ﬁrst observed by EM studies as striations at the bud neck that disperse in septin mutants ( 48 , 49 ) . Later , septins were shown by immunoﬂuorescence to arrive at the cell cortex prior to bud emergence ( 110 , 184 ) and shortly thereafter reorganize into a collar that persists at the bud neck until after the completion of cell division ( 167 ) . Initial assembly of these septin structures depends on the activity of the GTPase Cdc42 ( 65 , 119 , 120 , 167 ) and two of its downstream effectors , Gic1 and Gic2 ( 167 ) . 618 MOSELEY AND GOODE M ICROBIOL .

R EV . on N o v e m be r 1 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / mm b r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Puriﬁed yeast septins assemble into ﬁlaments in vitro ( 111 ) , and GTP binding is required for their polymerization and in vivo functions ( 381 ) . Formation of the actomyosin ring depends on septin integ - rity ( 34 , 217 ) ; however , only the Myo1 ring contracts ( the septin ring does not ) , indicating that they are separate struc - tures ( 110 , 184 , 222 ) . In addition to positioning the actomyosin ring , septins recruit enzymes , such as chitin synthase II , re - quired to form the septum ( 33 ) . One model to explain these critical roles of septins is that they are near the top of a physical interaction network or hierarchy for assembly of components at the bud neck . However , potential physical interactions be - tween septins and the actomyosin ring machinery have re - mained elusive in yeast . In animal cells , the adaptor protein anillin physically links actin and septin ﬁlaments in vitro ( 188 ) . The ﬁssion yeast protein Mid1p has some sequence homology with anillin and functions in placement of the contractile ring at the middle of the cell ( 56 ) . However , Mid1p has not been shown to bind to actin or septins ; rather , Mid1p may interact with type II myosin at the division site ( 254 ) . No clear anillin homologue exists in budding yeast , but Mid1 and anillin do share limited sequence homology with the bud site selection protein Bud4 ( 29 , 270 , 328 , 365 ) . Further , Bud4 localizes to the neck ( 328 ) and binds Iqg1 , consistent with a cytokinetic func - tion ( 280 ) . So , Bud4 is a reasonable candidate for actin - septin linkage functions . In addition , budding yeast Afr1 may facili - tate actin - septin interactions , as it associates with Iqg1 and the septin protein Cdc12 ( 191 , 279 ) . However , the role of Afr1 may be specialized for mating projection formation during the cel - lular response to pheromone ( 118 ) . Other recent work has deﬁned a nonphysical anchoring mechanism by which septins maintain localization of some proteins at the bud neck . Prior to cytokinesis , the septin ring splits into two separate rings ( 223 ) , and this split ring structure compartmentalizes and thereby concentrates ( i . e . , corrals ) fac - tors such as Spa2 and Chs2 at the bud neck ( 77 ) . In wild - type cells , Spa2 diffuses freely within this small zone between the split septin rings . However , in cdc12 - 6 mutants , Spa2 and Chs2 rapidly diffuse away from the bud neck after cells are shifted to the nonpermissive temperature and the split septin ring orga - nization is lost ( 77 ) . Thus , septins may have dual roles in localizing cytokinetic machinery to the bud neck , serving pos - sibly as both physical scaffolds and diffusion barriers . MECHANISMS OF ACTIN FILAMENT ASSEMBLY , ORGANIZATION , AND TURNOVER Introduction Below , we describe the properties and mechanisms of the S . cerevisiae actin - binding proteins known to affect actin dynamics and / or organization , summarized in Table 1 . In each case , we attempt to relate the activities of these proteins back to their cellular roles . Our discussion includes the type I myosins Myo3 and Myo5 , which help promote actin assembly , but not type II and V myosins , which have been reviewed elsewhere in detail ( 44 , 236 , 305 , 324 , 373 ) . Biochemical properties of actin . Actin is a globular 42 - kDa protein that exists in dynamic equilibrium between two states , monomer and ﬁlamentous polymer . The double - helical ﬁla - ments assemble in a head - to - tail manner , imparting polarity to the ﬁlament . The two ends of the ﬁlament are referred to as barbed and pointed , owing to the arrowhead pattern observed upon decoration with the S1 fragment of myosin ( 296 ) . Assem - bly of actin monomers into a ﬁlament involves an initial nu - cleation step , which is inherently slow due to instability of actin dimers and trimers . However , once assembled , ﬁlaments are stable and undergo rapid polarized growth , with monomeric ATP - actin subunits preferentially adding to the barbed end ( 11 . 6 subunits (cid:2) M (cid:5) 1 s (cid:5) 1 ) versus the pointed end ( 1 . 3 subunits (cid:2) M (cid:5) 1 s (cid:5) 1 ) ( 293 ) . Addition of an ATP - actin subunit to the barbed end of a ﬁlament triggers hydrolysis of ATP bound to that subunit ( half - life [ t 1 / 2 ] ) , (cid:3) 5 seconds ) ( 295 ) , producing actin bound to ADP and P i . In a subsequent ( slower ) step , actin subunits release P i ( t 1 / 2 , (cid:3) 5 min ) to produce actin bound to ADP ( 295 ) . Thus , ﬁlaments at steady state ( undergoing addition and loss at their ends ) are a mosaic , enriched in ATP - bound actin near barbed ends , ADP - P i actin in the mid - dle , and ADP - actin at the pointed ends . ADP - actin subunits dissociate from ﬁlament pointed ends , and the resulting ADP - actin monomer pool must undergo nucleotide exchange ( ATP for ADP ) to “recharge” monomers for subsequent rounds of barbed end addition . This property of net subunit addition occurring at barbed ends and net subunit dissociation occur - ring at pointed ends leads to steady - state cycling of subunits through ﬁlaments , called treadmilling ( Fig . 8 ) ( 268 ) . Actin turnover refers to the collective dynamic events of actin sub - units treadmilling through ﬁlaments , dissociating from ﬁla - ment ends and , as monomers , undergoing nucleotide exchange to recycle them for new rounds of polymerization . Each step in the process of actin ﬁlament assembly and turnover represents an opportunity for cellular control in re - modeling the actin cytoskeleton . All eukaryotic cells contain a core set of actin - binding proteins that regulate actin nucle - ation , barbed end addition , pointed end dissociation , ﬁlament stability , and nucleotide exchange on monomers . For example , the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins bypass the inherently slow formation of actin dimers and trimers to nucleate actin poly - merization ( 194 , 401 ) . Filaments are also severed and rapidly disassembled by factors such as actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / coﬁlin , Aip1 , twinﬁlin , and Srv2 / CAP ( 24 , 268 ) . Fila - ments can be stabilized by capping proteins and side - binding proteins . Further , a number of actin monomer - binding pro - teins cooperate to replenish the assembly - competent pool of actin monomers by catalyzing the conversion of ADP mono - mers dissociating from ﬁlament ends to ATP monomers . The activities and mechanisms of these factors are detailed in this section , with emphasis on how these factors work together rather than alone to affect actin ﬁlament dynamics and orga - nization . Assembly of Actin at Cortical Patches The Arp2 / 3 complex . Actin patches arise at cortical sites where no preexisting ﬁlamentous actin can be detected and , thus , require de novo actin nucleation . Of the two known actin nucleators that are conserved from yeast to mammals ( the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins ) , only the Arp2 / 3 complex is found at patches ( 248 ) .

Further , the terminal phenotypes of these deletion strains show a severe or complete loss of cortical actin patch staining . The Arp2 / 3 complex has been proposed to nucleate actin assembly by bringing together its Arp2 and Arp3 subunits to mimic the barbed end of a ﬁlament ( 294 ) . This leaves the complex bound to the pointed end of the new ﬁlament with apparent nanomolar afﬁnity ( 259 ) . The complex also can bind to the sides of a preexisting ( mother ) actin ﬁlament and nu - cleate formation of a new ( daughter ) ﬁlament at a 70° angle , thus producing branched actin networks ( 9 , 35 , 150 ) ( Fig . 9C ) . Alone , the Arp2 / 3 complex has minimal nucleation activity and requires an activator or NPF for strong nucleation . The crystal structure of the inactive bovine Arp2 / 3 complex reveals a large separation between the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits ( 313 ) , and recent studies using electron microscopy and ﬂuorescence res - onance energy transfer analysis have demonstrated that WASp / Las17 induces large structural rearrangements in the complex that bring Arp2 and Arp3 closer together to nucleate actin ( Fig . 9 ) ( 124 , 316 ) . These observations in turn raise a new set of mechanistic questions . Which subunits facilitate Arp2 / 3 complex binding to the sides of ﬁlaments ? What are the precise rearrangements of subunits upon activation ? Which subunits , and in what order , relay activation from WASp to the ﬁnal repositioning of Arp2 and Arp3 ? Answers to these questions will likely require mutagenesis of speciﬁc subunits involved , coupled with structural analyses of mutant and / or WASp - bound complexes . Another fundamental property of Arp2 / 3 complex function and regulation is binding and hydrolysis of ATP by the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits . Arp2 and Arp3 both bind ATP ( 73 , 209 ) , but recent work suggests that only Arp2 hydrolyzes ATP ( 74 , 208 ) . Hydrolysis of ATP by Arp2 plays a critical role in WASp - induced conformational changes in the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 74 , 124 ) . Further , hydrolysis by Arp2 and / or Arp3 may promote debranching of ﬁlament networks by dissociating Arp2 / 3 com - plex from the pointed ends of ﬁlaments ( 208 ) . Consistent with the importance of ATP binding and hydrolysis for Arp2 / 3 com - plex activity in vitro , mutations in the nucleotide - binding pocket of Arp2 and Arp3 severely impair actin patch dynamics and endocytosis in vivo ( 233 ) . NPFs . The S . cerevisiae Arp2 / 3 complex is regulated in vivo by ﬁve NPFs : Las17 , Myo3 , Myo5 , Pan1 , and Abp1 ( 87 , 98 , 127 , 207 , 406 ) . Each NPF has an acidic motif that facilitates binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex , possibly to the Arp3 and ARPC1 / p40 subunits ( Fig . 10B ) ( 181 , 199 , 286 , 398 ) . In addition , Las17 binds to G - actin , whereas Myo3 , Myo5 , Pan1 , and Abp1 bind to F - actin ( Table 1 ) . For Las17 , Pan1 , and Abp1 , actin binding has been shown to be critical for their NPF activities ( 307 , 315 , 371 ) . Actin monomer - binding NPFs such as Las17 are thought to present their bound actin subunit to the Arp2 surface to facilitate nucleation . Actin ﬁlament - binding NPFs are thought to recruit the Arp2 / 3 complex to the sides of preformed ﬁla - ments to stimulate nucleation . Understanding the precise ac - tivation mechanism of each NPF represents an important chal - lenge for future research . All ﬁve NPFs colocalize with the Arp2 / 3 complex , and the primary function ascribed to each NPF is activation of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly . However , each NPF arrives at a different stage of patch maturation . These and other genetic data suggest that NPFs perform distinct yet genetically over - lapping functions in patch development ( see below ) , possibly acting sequentially on the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 173 ) . Available genetic and biochemical data suggest that Las17 provides the strongest NPF activity in forming patches , with Pan1 and Myo3 / Myo5 being ancillary as NPFs . Further , the weaker NPF FIG . 8 . Assembly and turnover cycle of actin ﬁlaments . Actin ﬁlaments are polarized , with a fast - growing ( barbed ) end and a slow - growing ( pointed ) end . ATP - bound actin monomers ( light gray ) preferentially associate with the barbed end of the ﬁlament . ATP hydrolysis on an actin subunit is triggered by its addition to the end of a ﬁlament . The rate of this reaction varies for actins from different species . After hydrolysis , ADP and P i remain bound to actin ( medium gray ) , followed shortly by the release of P i to yield ADP - bound actin ( dark gray ) . Thus , steady - state F - actin exists as a mosaic of actin subunits in different nucleotide - bound states . At steady state , the pointed ends of ﬁlaments undergo a net loss of ADP - actin subunits , generating a pool of ADP - actin monomers ( G - actin ) . Following their dissociation , free monomers rapidly exchange nucleotide ( ATP for ADP ) to replenish an assembly - competent pool of ATP - bound G - actin . The actin monomer - binding protein proﬁlin is one factor that can accelerate the rate of nucleotide exchange on G - actin . Proﬁlin binds to the barbed end of an actin monomer ( see cocrystal in right panel ) , sterically blocking the addition of proﬁlin - bound actin monomers to the pointed ends of actin ﬁlaments , but not the barbed ends . Based on these properties and the high abundance of proﬁlin in cells , it is hypothesized that most in vivo actin assembly occurs speciﬁcally at ﬁlament barbed ends . Upon addition of a proﬁlin - bound actin subunit to a ﬁlament barbed end , proﬁlin disassociates rapidly , leaving the barbed end free for addition of the next subunit . The coordinates for the proﬁlin - actin complex were obtained from reference 336 .

The Arp2 / 3 complex mechanism of actin assembly . ( A ) Projection structures of free and ligand - bound yeast Arp2 / 3 complexes ( each computed from 1 , 000 to 3 , 000 separate images ) . Electron microscopy and single - particle analyses were used to show that the Arp2 / 3 complex exists in an equilibrium among open , intermediate , and closed conformations ( middle three panels ) , referring to the relative positions of the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits within the complex . Binding of an inhibitor ( Crn1 / coronin ) promotes the open conformation ( left panel ) , while binding of an NPF ( Las17 / WASp ) promotes the closed conformation ( 316 ) . The open conformation is thought to represent the inactive state , while the closed conformation is “primed” for nucleation . ( B ) Model for structural rearrangements during activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Arrows indicate conformational changes leading to the next structure in the activation sequence . In the transition from the open to the intermediate conformation , Arp2 and Arp3 subunits move toward the center of the gap separating the two subunits . Next , there is a further closure of the gap between Arp2 and Arp3 by a movement of Arp2 toward Arp3 and possibly a small movement of Arc18 toward the center of the gap , creating the closed conformation . WASp is shown binding to Arp2 and Arp3 , and possibly also to p40 , stabilizing the closed conformation . Coronin is shown binding to p35 , stabilizing the open conformation . ( C ) Model for nucleation of branched actin ﬁlaments by the Arp2 / 3 complex . Solid black arrows indicate physical interactions ; the dashed arrow depicts closure of the complex upon Las17 binding . The crystal structure of the bovine Arp2 / 3 complex ( 313 ) is docked into the three - dimensional EM reconstruction of the yeast Arp2 / 3 complex in its open inactive conformation ( 316 ) . The complex associates with the side of an existing ( mother ) ﬁlament and nucleates formation of a new ( daughter ) ﬁlament at a 70° angle ( large red arrow ) . Nucleation is triggered by association of the Arp2 / 3 complex with Las17 and the side of the mother ﬁlament . These interactions promote major structural rearrangements within the Arp2 / 3 complex , bringing Arp2 and Arp3 closer together to nucleate an actin ﬁlament . Nucleation also requires Las17 binding to an actin monomer , presumably to provide the ﬁrst subunit of the daughter ﬁlament .

Below , we discuss what is known about the mechanism of each NPF and relate this to their functions at patches . ( i ) Las17 / WASp . Las17 ( also called Bee1 ) was the ﬁrst NPF reported in yeast and was identiﬁed by its sequence homology with mammalian WASp ( 213 ) . Early studies showed that las17 (cid:4) cells have defects in patch organization , and a perme - abilized cell assay that measures incorporation of ﬂuorescent actin was used to show that Las17 is required for actin assem - bly at cortical sites ( 213 ) . Following demonstration that mam - malian WASp activates the Arp2 / 3 complex , a homologous WA fragment of Las17 ( consisting of its WH2 [ W ] domain and acidic [ A ] motif ) was shown to activate the yeast Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( 406 ) . From this work , two key questions emerged regard - ing Las17 NPF function . First , how does Las17 activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ? Second , how is Las17 itself regulated ? In - sights into both of these questions came after puriﬁcation and biochemical characterization of intact , full - length Las17 ( 315 ) . It was revealed that full - length Las17 has an NPF activity far more robust than that of its WA fragment , suggesting that sequences N terminal to WA make major contributions to activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex . This is also consistent with genetic results showing that complete deletion of LAS17 causes much more severe defects than deletion of the WA fragment alone ( las17 (cid:4) WA ) ( 406 ) . Increased NPF activity for full - length Las17 has been postulated to arise from N - terminal regions binding to F - actin and / or the Arp2 / 3 complex . WASp family members ( including SCAR / WAVE , which is not conserved in yeast ) can be regulated by one of two basic mechanisms , auto - inhibition ( in which the N and C termini associate directly to inhibit NPF activity ) or transinhibition ( mediated by direct interactions of additional proteins ) ( 43 ) . In both mechanisms , inhibition is relieved by signals from acti - vated Rho GTPases . For example , Cdc42 binds directly to the G TPase - b inding d omain ( GBD ) of N - WASp to relieve auto - inhibition ( 320 ) , and Rac binds directly to one of the compo - nents of a proposed WAVE1 transinhibitory complex to re - lease active WAVE1 ( 89 ) , although this mechanism remains controversial ( reviewed in reference 359 ) . It has been unclear how yeast WASp ( Las17 ) activity is controlled . Las17 lacks a GBD and fails to bind yeast Rho GTPases ( 213 ) , and there are no obvious yeast homologues to the proteins comprising the WAVE transinhibitory complex . Biochemically , puriﬁed full - length Las17 is active ( i . e . , not auto - inhibited ) and constitu - tively promotes Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin assembly ( 315 ) . Two known Las17 ligands , Sla1 and Bbc1 ( 213 , 370 ) , directly inhibit but do not abolish Las17 activity ( 315 ) . Thus , it seems likely that Las17 activity may be controlled by transin - hibition , similar to WAVE1 . In addition , Las17 has many other ligands that may contribute to its transinhibition and release ( 126 ) , including Vrp1 ( WIP homologue ) ( 98 , 207 , 229 , 377 ) , type I myosins ( 98 , 207 ) , and Rvs167p , Lsb1p , Lsb2p , Pin3 / Lsb3p , Ysc84 / Lsb4p , and Bzz1p ( 229 , 370 ) . A signiﬁcant chal - lenge will be to determine how these different factors tempo - rally control Las17 activity at different stages of patch formation . There also may be lessons to learn from studies in mammalian cells , where WIP binds stably to and inhibits N - WASp . This N - WASp – WIP complex is activated by Cdc42 speciﬁcally in the presence of Toca - 1 ( homologous to Bzz1 ) , which binds to Cdc42 FIG . 10 . Yeast NPFs .

All of the homologous proteins are ex - pressed in yeast , making it tempting to draw direct parallels be - tween these systems . However , Las17 and Bzz1 both lack Cdc42 - binding domains . Further , bzz1 (cid:4) mutants show no obvious defects in cell growth , actin organization , or endocytosis ( 356 ) . Thus , Las17 regulation by these factors may be distinct in yeast and / or require additional proteins to achieve effects similar to animal cell interactions of Cdc42 - TOCA - WIP - WASp . ( ii ) Pan1 . Pan1 is recruited to early patches along with Las17 , well before the arrival of the Arp2 / 3 complex and de - tection of ﬁlamentous actin . Pan1 could be recruited to patches through its interactions with End3 , Sla1 , and / or clathrin adap - tors ( 363 , 364 , 402 ) . pan1 (cid:4) mutations are inviable , but muta - tion of the Pan1 acidic domain ( pan1 - 101 , which abolishes NPF activity ) causes no obvious growth defects . This mutation does however show synthetic growth defects when combined with arp2 alleles ( 71 , 87 , 402 ) . Thus , it appears that Pan1 performs essential functions required for endocytosis and cell growth distinct from its role as an NPF . Pan1 NPF activity requires its A motif , which interacts di - rectly with the Arp2 / 3 complex , and an atypical WH2 domain , which binds directly to F - actin with low micromolar afﬁnity ( 371 ) . Through these interactions , Pan1 may recruit the Arp2 / 3 complex to ﬁlament sides to stimulate nucleation and possibly promote formation of branched actin networks , such as those seen at patches ( 314 , 423 ) . It is unclear when in patch devel - opment Pan1 functions as an NPF . However , its NPF activity is strongly inhibited in vitro by Prk1 phosphorylation ( 371 ) . These phosphorylation events could signal the observed loss of Pan1 from patches upon transition to rapid movements . Abp1 may also play a role in these events , as it arrives just before this transition and directly recruits Ark1 / Prk1 kinases to patches ( 68 , 102 ) . Accordingly , abp1 (cid:4) cells show a delay in loss of Sla1 from patches as they transition to rapid movement ( 174 ) . Pre - sumably , Pan1 also remains on fast - moving patches in abp1 (cid:4) cells , since Sla1 and Pan1 form a complex that is disrupted by Ark1 / Prk1 phosphorylation ( 427 ) . ( iii ) Myo3 and Myo5 . Just before the onset of rapid patch movement , Las17 and Pan1 are joined by the genetically re - dundant type I myosins Myo3 and Myo5 ( 172 , 174 ) . These proteins are comprised of an N - terminal motor domain , a lipid - binding TH1 domain , an F - actin - binding TH2 domain , an SH3 domain , and an Arp2 / 3 complex - binding A motif ( Fig . 10 ) . Myo3 and Myo5 , like Las17 , are required for actin patch assembly in the permeabilized cell assay ( see “Las17 / WASp” above ) , and myo3 myo5 double mutants are synthetic lethal with las17 (cid:4) WA mutants , suggesting that Myo3 , Myo5 , and Las17 are redundant as NPFs ( 98 , 207 ) . The NPF activities of Myo3 and Myo5 have not yet been characterized biochemi - cally , but the TH2 - SH3 - A fragment of S . pombe myosin type I activates the Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro ( 210 ) . This fragment binds with very weak afﬁnity to F - actin and does not bind G - actin , leaving the myosin I NPF mechanism unclear . One model is that Myo3 and Myo5 NPF activities require interactions with Vrp1 ( WIP homologue ) , which binds to G - actin ( 15 , 98 , 116 , 207 , 411 ) . Indeed , one recent study showed that puriﬁed S . pombe Vrp1 enhances the NPF activity of the TH2 - SH3 - A fragment ( 352 ) . In addition , it has been suggested that Myo3 and Myo5 function in a large complex that includes Las17 ( 98 , 207 ) . Based on the late arrival of Myo3 / Myo5 to patches and an increased number of cortical invaginations seen by electron microscopy in myo3 myo5 mutants ( 172 ) , it has been proposed that Myo3 and Myo5 help promote the scission of endocytic vesicles from the membrane at the onset of rapid patch move - ment . Consistent with this possibility , ﬁssion yeast type I my - osin can alter the composition and organization of membrane domains ( 361 ) . How the motor activity of myosin contributes to function awaits determination , but motor activity is required for patch assembly in the permeabilized cell assay ( 207 ) . Motor activity could produce a speciﬁc arrangement of actin ﬁlaments or , alternatively , transport a cargo such as the Arp2 / 3 complex to speciﬁc regions within a patch . Work on Acanthamoeba castellanii type I myosin ( 281 ) indicates a low duty ratio for type I myosins , suggesting that processive movement by Myo3 / Myo5 requires multiple motors on a cargo . ( iv ) Abp1 . Abp1 arrives at actin patches approximately when Myo3 and Myo5 do , just prior to the onset of rapid patch movement ( 173 ) . However , once rapid movement commences , Myo3 and Myo5 are left behind at the cortex ( 172 ) while Abp1 remains associated with patches throughout internalization and transport on cables ( 159 , 173 ) . abp1 (cid:4) mutants fail to shed Sla1 and possibly other early patch components during the transition to fast patch movement , suggesting that Abp1 has a role in disassembly of the endocytic structures ( 174 ) . Con - sistent with this model , Abp1 recruits Ark1 and Prk1 kinases to patches ( 68 , 102 ) ; these kinases phosphorylate Pan1 to disrupt the Sla1 - Pan1 - End3 complex ( 427 ) . This model also is consistent with Abp1’s role in recruiting to patches Sjl1 ( synaptojanin homologue ) , which is implicated in endocytic coat disassembly ( 357 ) . The biochemical properties of Abp1 provide a plausible explanation for these functions . Abp1 is comprised of an N - terminal ADF / coﬁlin h omology ( ADFH ) actin - binding domain ( ABD ) , two A motifs , a polyproline region , and a C - terminal SH3 domain ( Fig . 10 ) . The NPF activity of Abp1 requires not only its A motifs but also its ADFH domain , through which it binds directly to F - actin with submicromolar afﬁnity ( 127 ) . These properties allow Abp1 to recruit the Arp2 / 3 complex to the sides of preexisting ﬁlaments , which leads to its modest NPF activity . The abilities of Abp1 to bind both F - actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex are required in vitro for Abp1 NPF activity and in vivo for its shared genetic functions with Sac6 ( 307 ) . Similar to its mammalian relative cortactin ( 375 , 399 ) , Abp1 may displace Las17 / WASp from the Arp2 / 3 complex and sta - bilize ﬁlament branches , but this remains to be tested . What is the functional relationship of Abp1 with other NPFs ? With its two A motifs , Abp1 binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex with high afﬁnity , yet has notably weak NPF activity compared to full - length Las17 and Pan1 ( 127 ) . These properties are well - suited for Abp1 acting as a competitive antagonist , which is supported by Abp1 attenuation of Las17 NPF activity in vitro and by genetic interactions of abp1 (cid:4) with other NPF mutants ( 71 ) . It is also consistent with the appearance of Abp1 at patches after other NPFs ( 173 ) . Thus , sequential interactions of NPFs with the Arp2 / 3 complex may regulate the transition from slow to fast patch movement . In addition to its NPF role , Abp1 recruits Srv2 / CAP to patches by physically linking it to F - actin ( 23 , 82 , 214 ) . As such , Abp1 may facilitate rapid turnover of F - actin , which is re - 624 MOSELEY AND GOODE M ICROBIOL . M OL . B IOL .

Coronin : spatial inhibitor of Arp2 / 3 complex activity . A novel form of Arp2 / 3 complex regulation , distinct from NPF activity , is mediated by the yeast homologue of coronin Crn1 , which local - izes to actin patches ( 128 , 142 ) . Crn1 was isolated initially from crude extracts on microtubule afﬁnity columns as a factor coelut - ing with actin ( 128 ) . Recombinant Crn1 binds with high afﬁnity to F - actin and cross - links F - actin to microtubules . F - actin binding is mediated by an amino - terminal WD repeat (cid:7) - propeller structure , although the actin - binding surface has not been identiﬁed . This domain is followed by a 200 - residue - long “unique” region of unknown structure that mediates microtubule binding and is not conserved in other species . At the C terminus is a coiled - coil domain that mediates Crn1 oligomerization and is required for F - actin cross - linking and bundling . Independent of F - actin cross - linking , Crn1 also modestly promotes actin assembly ; however , the mechanism underlying this activity remains unclear . The (cid:7) - propeller and coiled - coil domains are conserved in coronins from diverse species , as are the abilities to bind and cross - link F - actin ( 75 ) . The coiled - coil domain of Crn1 also binds directly to the Arp2 / 3 complex , through interactions with the ARPC2 / p35 sub - unit . This interaction directly inhibits actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 161 ) , arising from direct Crn1 - Arp2 / 3 interac - tions ( NPF independent ) that stabilize the Arp2 / 3 complex in its open ( inactive ) conformation ( 316 ) . In electron micrographs of the Crn1 - bound Arp2 / 3 complex , the globular (cid:7) - propeller do - main rests (cid:3) 20 Å from the ARPC2 / p35 subunit ( Fig . 9A ) . The coiled - coil and unique regions mediating this interaction are not visible , presumably because they lack substantial mass and / or tertiary structure . Since the mammalian coronin Cor1 also coim - munoprecipitates with the Arp2 / 3 complex , this regulatory func - tion of coronin may be widely conserved ( 50 ) . What is the cellular function of Arp2 / 3 complex inhibition by Crn1 ? While the coiled - coil domain of Crn1 mediates inhibi - tion , the presence of preformed actin ﬁlaments relieves inhi - bition and thereby permits Arp2 / 3 nucleation activity ( 161 ) . Thus , Crn1 appears to spatially restrict Arp2 / 3 activity to the sides of preexisting ﬁlaments by suppressing de novo nucle - ation in the absence of ﬁlaments . As such , Crn1 may promote formation of branched ﬁlament networks , a model that can be tested by characterizing Crn1 effects on ﬁlament branching by the Arp2 / 3 complex . Crn1 localization to cortical patches requires both its (cid:7) - pro - peller and coiled - coil domains , suggesting requirements for both F - actin binding and coiled - coil - mediated functions ( oli - gomerization and / or Arp2 / 3 complex binding ) . Although the timing of its arrival to patches has not been reported , it may be similar to that of other F - actin - binding proteins , Abp1 , Sac6 , and Cap1 / Cap2 , arriving late and persisting on patches through rapid movements . Surprisingly for a factor with such potent inhibitory activity on the Arp2 / 3 complex , deletion of CRN1 does not result in detectable growth or morphological defects ( 128 ) . However , a physiological role for Crn1 in regulating the Arp2 / 3 complex is supported by synthetic defects between crn1 (cid:4) and arp2 - 21 mutations ( 161 ) . Further , crn1 (cid:4) has syn - thetic defects in cell growth and actin organization with cof1 - 22 and act1 - 159 ( mutations that slow actin turnover ) , suggesting a role in promoting actin turnover . However , the mechanistic basis of such a function remains undetermined . Several aspects of Crn1 function that remain to be resolved include the following . How does Crn1 regulation of Arp2 / 3 complex activity contribute to patch maturation and endocy - tosis ? Mechanistically , how does the presence of F - actin over - ride Crn1 inhibition of the Arp2 / 3 complex ? Does Crn1 regu - late actin turnover in vivo with coﬁlin ? Does Crn1 interact with microtubules in vivo , and how might this be coordinated with its actin functions ? Open questions about the Arp2 / 3 complex . In addition to direct inhibition of the Arp2 / 3 complex by Crn1 , binding of certain proteins ( e . g . , tropomyosin ) to actin ﬁlaments prohibits Arp2 / 3 complex association and thus indirectly inhibits the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 37 ) . This may explain why the Arp2 / 3 com - plex is not detected on actin cables , which are decorated by Tpm1 and Tpm2 . It also raises an important mechanistic ques - tion : how do cables and not patches selectively become deco - rated with Tpm1 and Tpm2 ? Another factor that may regulate Arp2 / 3 complex function is Cmd1 ( calmodulin ) , which inter - acts both genetically and biochemically with the ARPC2 / p35 subunit ( 330 ) . There are likely many other cellular factors that must be coordinated with NPFs and Crn1 to control Arp2 / 3 complex function . There are also many open questions regarding Arp2 / 3 com - plex cellular function . First , what is the speciﬁc role of Arp2 / 3 complex - based actin polymerization in patch maturation and endocytosis ? The Arp2 / 3 complex is required for actin assem - bly , and actin assembly is required for endocytosis , but what function does this provide ? Actin polymerization could pro - vide force generation to drive vesicle scission ; alternatively , it could provide a dynamic scaffold to organize endocytic factors that drive membrane invagination and scission ( 93 ) . There are also non - patch / endocytosis functions of the Arp2 / 3 complex to consider . For instance , the involvement of the Arp2 / 3 complex in cable and cytokinetic ring assembly has not been ruled out . Although studies on arp2 , arp3 , and arc35 mutants have not indicated a role in cable assembly ( 99 , 407 , 408 ) , given the physical links between patches and cables ( 159 , 177 ) and mul - tiple reports suggesting interactions between the Arp2 / 3 com - plex and formins ( 69 , 152 ) , this question deserves further in - quiry . Further , while one study in budding yeast suggests that the actin ring is assembled by formins and not the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 369 ) , a separate study in ﬁssion yeast reports a role for the Arp2 / 3 complex in ring assembly ( 288 ) . Thus , addi - tional investigations are needed to resolve this potential Arp2 / 3 complex function at cytokinetic rings . Finally , separate from assembly of the three major actin structures—patches , cables , and rings—Arp2 / 3 complex function contributes to organelle inheritance , nuclear export , and mitotic spindle ori - entation ( 41 , 330 , 331 , 416 ) . Understanding the mechanistic basis of these functions could broaden the range of action for the Arp2 / 3 complex . Assembly of Actin Cables Formins Bni1 and Bnr1 . Actin cables are essential for po - larized cell growth , but until recently the mechanism of actin cable assembly was unknown . Early cell biology studies sug - gested a role for the two budding yeast formins Bni1 and Bnr1 in cable formation ( 97 , 164 , 176 , 182 , 284 ) , but it was hypoth - V OL . 70 , 2006 MECHANISM AND FUNCTION OF THE YEAST ACTIN CYTOSKELETON 625 on N o v e m be r 1 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / mm b r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m esized they had indirect roles in this process , serving as mo - lecular scaffolds . Further , technical obstacles in purifying these large proteins ( (cid:3) 200 kDa ) delayed characterizing their effects on actin in vitro . Similar to all formins of the Diaphanous - related formin ( DRF ) family , Bni1 and Bnr1 are comprised of well - deﬁned domains that differentially contribute to their mechanism and regulation ( Fig . 11A ) . These include the formin homology 2 ( FH2 ) domain , FH1 domain , GBD , Diaph - anous inhibitory domain ( DID ) , and Diaphanous autoregula - tory domain ( DAD ) ( 100 , 389 ) . A critical breakthrough in understanding the role of formins in regulating the actin cytoskeleton came when two studies showed that the FH2 domain of Bni1 is critical for cable formation ( 99 , 325 ) . Biochemical studies closely followed , demonstrating that puri - ﬁed FH2 - containing fragments of Bni1 directly nucleate actin assembly ( 303 , 326 ) . Similar actin - nucleating activities have since been reported for formins from a wide variety of animals , fungi , and plants , making it clear that actin assembly is a conserved function of formins ( 149 ) . Budding yeast expresses two formins , Bni1 and Bnr1 ( 164 ) , which partially overlap in their localization to the bud tip and bud neck ( Fig . 5A ) . Bni1 and Bnr1 also have distinct and overlapping functions in the assembly of cables and the acto - myosin ring ( 99 , 304 , 325 , 369 ) . A comparison of their bio - chemical activities reveals differences : Bnr1 speciﬁcally bun - dles actin ﬁlaments and has 10 - to 15 - fold more potent actin FIG . 11 .

Alternating regions of the FH2 are displaced rapidly in response to subunit addition to allow insertion of the next subunit . Importantly , the precise biophysical mechanism of formin processive capping remains unclear . ( E ) While the formin caps the barbed end of the ﬁlament it has nucleated , the Arp2 / 3 complex caps the opposite ( pointed ) end of the ﬁlament , leaving the barbed end free . Thus , ﬁlaments nucleated speciﬁcally by formins are protected from early termination of elongation by capping protein . Directions of new ﬁlament growth are noted by red arrows . 626 MOSELEY AND GOODE M ICROBIOL . M OL . B IOL .

Bni1 and Bnr1 also appear to be regulated by distinct mechanisms ( see below ) . How these differences in activity and regulation tailor Bni1 and Bnr1 to their respective cellular functions remains to be determined . What is the formin mechanism of actin assembly ? Whereas the Arp2 / 3 complex bypasses kinetic barriers to actin assembly by mimicking the barbed end of an actin ﬁlament , formins use a different mechanism . Kinetic studies suggest that the FH2 domain promotes ﬁlament assembly by stabilizing polymeriza - tion intermediates , actin dimers and / or trimers , which are oth - erwise extremely short - lived species ( 300 ) . This is facilitated by formins having very high afﬁnity for F - actin . Once nucleated , formins remain bound to the rapidly growing barbed end of the ﬁlament while guiding insertional addition of actin subunits . This activity is referred to as processive capping . The ﬁrst indications of this activity came from the demonstration that Bni1 FH2 localizes to ﬁlament barbed ends by immunoelec - tron microscopy ( 303 ) and does not completely inhibit barbed end growth ( 300 , 303 ) . Two subsequent studies showed that Bni1 FH2 protects elongating barbed ends of ﬁlaments from the inhibitory effects of conventional capping proteins ( 253 , 429 ) . This process , which involves a strong interaction between FH2 and ﬁlament barbed ends ( K d (cid:1) 20 nM ) ( 253 , 300 , 303 ) , has now been visualized in real time using TIRF microscopy of individual FH2 - capped actin ﬁlaments ( 197 ) and drives rapid barbed end ﬁlament growth at various rates ( 194 , 197 , 300 , 303 , 429 ) . While a thorough mechanistic understanding of processive capping is still far off , critical insights have been gained by recent structural analyses . First , the FH2 dimerizes , and point mutations disrupting dimerization abolish actin assembly ( 253 ) . This suggested that a two - headed actin - binding struc - ture was required , opening the possibility of alternating actin - binding contacts to allow insertional growth and persistent association with the ﬁlament barbed end . Shortly thereafter , the crystal structure of the Bni1 FH2 domain was solved , which revealed a ﬂexibly tethered dimer in which each FH2 molecule has two actin - binding sites ( Fig . 11B ) ( 414 ) . Sites of contact between FH2 and actin have since been deﬁned at an atomic level by a cocrystal structure of the Bni1 FH2 domain bound to tetramethylrhodamine - labeled actin ( 282 ) ( Fig . 11C ) . Based on these ﬁndings , several different models for proces - sive capping have been proposed . First , the stair - stepping model envisions two ﬂexibly tethered actin - binding heads al - ternating interactions with the growing barbed end of the ﬁl - ament ( 414 ) . Anticooperative conformational changes in FH2 drive alternating contacts to allow subunit addition ( 414 ) . A caveat to this mechanism , however , is that it requires rapid rotation of the FH2 dimer to account for a helical twist of the actin ﬁlament , and experimental evidence suggests that such a rotation may not occur ( 197 ) . To resolve this paradox , a second model suggests that the unidirectional twist induced by multi - ple stair steps may be relieved by a periodic “backward” step , in which the FH2 twists in the opposite direction as the ﬁla - ment ( 344 ) . A third model proposes that the FH2 dimer may act like a shaft in a bearing , encircling the growing actin ﬁla - ment ( 197 ) . However , the molecular contacts that maintain persistent FH2 association with the growing barbed end in this model are not clear . Finally , a fourth model suggests that the FH2 may adopt an end - side - binding mechanism , whereby it associates with the side of barbed ends to allow new subunit addition while prohibiting binding of capping proteins ( 137 ) . Experimental evidence has not yet ruled out any of these mechanisms and , in fact , they may be more similar mechanis - tically than they are distinct . Resolving the mechanism may require the use of high - resolution electron microscopy tech - niques to image FH2 dimers bound to the barbed ends of ﬁlaments . Similar techniques have been used to deﬁne confor - mational changes in the Arp2 / 3 complex upon WASp activa - tion and at ﬁlament branches ( 91 , 316 ) and to image protein complexes at microtubule ends ( 422 ) . While recent efforts have focused on deﬁning the formin mechanism of actin assembly , many critical questions remain open surrounding formin regulation . Like WASp and the Arp2 / 3 complex , the potent activities of formins are likely subject to tight spatial and temporal regulation . Below , we discuss what is known about the regulation of Bni1 and Bnr1 by their known ligands , which include Rho GTPases , proﬁlin , Bud6 / Aip3 , Tef1 ( eEF1 (cid:8) homologue ) , and Spa2 . Proﬁlin - FH1 interactions : a throttle for ﬁlament elongation . Proﬁlin is an abundant actin monomer - binding protein found in all eukaryotic cells examined . Further , proﬁlin - bound actin monomers are considered the primary physiological substrate available for actin assembly in vivo . Proﬁlin has two separate binding surfaces , one that binds actin monomers and another that binds polyproline motifs , including those found in FH1 domains ( 225 , 410 ) . Indeed , early studies identiﬁed proﬁlin as a ligand of Bni1 and Bnr1 ( 97 , 164 ) . Proﬁlin binding blocks actin monomer addition to the pointed ends of ﬁlaments but freely allows addition to barbed ends ( 297 ) , consistent with the proﬁlin - actin cocrystal structure ( Fig . 8 ) ( 336 ) . These proper - ties of proﬁlin are fundamental to how it contributes to the formin mechanism of actin assembly . Importantly , the Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates actin ﬁlaments with free barbed ends and , thus , Arp2 / 3 - nucleated ﬁlaments elongate at similar rates in the presence and absence of proﬁlin ( 315 ) . In contrast , formins remain tightly associated with the barbed ends of ﬁlaments they nucleate and sterically inhibit capping protein association , raising an important mechanistic question : can proﬁlin - bound actin monomers be added efﬁ - ciently to the barbed ends of formin - capped ﬁlaments ? The ﬁrst insights came from Sagot et al . ( 326 ) , who found that Bni1 FH1 - FH2 assembles actin ﬁlaments equally well from a pool of free actin monomers or from proﬁlin - bound actin monomers . Further , FH1 - proﬁlin binding is required for formins to assem - ble proﬁlin - bound actin monomers ( 300 , 326 ) . Thus , FH2 alone promotes ﬁlament assembly from free actin monomers , but FH1 is required for ﬁlament assembly from proﬁlin - bound actin monomers . This emphasizes the importance of the FH1 domain for formin function in cells , where proﬁlin - bound actin monomers are the primary substrate available for ﬁlament assembly . As such , FH1 is required for formin - mediated actin assembly in vivo , which is supported by many studies ( 99 , 148 , 196 , 253 , 303 , 325 , 326 , 392 ) . More - recent biochemical studies have revealed exciting ef - fects on actin assembly resulting from proﬁlin - FH1 interac - tions with profound implications for formin function in vivo . By studying an isoform of mammalian formin mDia1 with extended polyproline tracts in its FH1 , Romero and coworkers V OL . 70 , 2006 MECHANISM AND FUNCTION OF THE YEAST ACTIN CYTOSKELETON 627 on N o v e m be r 1 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / mm b r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m demonstrated a formin / proﬁlin - dependent increase in rate of barbed end elongation—many times that of the diffusion - lim - ited rate of free barbed end growth ( 321 ) . Prior to this work , it was a widely held view that actin polymerization could not exceed diffusion - limited rates of assembly ( (cid:3) 11 subunits per second per micromolar ) . Thus , in a solution of 10 (cid:2) M G - actin , ﬁlaments would elongate at (cid:3) 110 subunits per second . The work of Romero et al . showed that ﬁlaments capped by form - ins can elongate at least ﬁvefold faster speciﬁcally when pro - ﬁlin is present . A more recent study now has used TIRF mi - croscopy to elegantly demonstrate these effects in real time for individual actin ﬁlaments capped by a variety of formins , in - cluding Bni1 ( 194 ) . Further , they show that the magnitude of the increase in ﬁlament elongation rate correlates with the number of proﬁlin - binding sites in FH1 . The largest increase measured ( (cid:3) 5 - fold ) occurs on ﬁlaments capped by mDia1 isoforms with 5 to 15 proﬁlin - binding sites . By comparison , Bni1 has three predicted proﬁlin - binding sites and exhibits an (cid:3) 2 - fold increase in rate of elongation ( over the rate of elon - gation at free barbed ends ) . Bnr1 has not yet been examined , but it has two predicted proﬁlin - binding sites , suggesting it likely increases the rate of elongation by no more than twofold . These results have important implications for formin func - tion in vivo . The yeast actin cable ﬂow rate is (cid:3) 0 . 3 (cid:2) m / s ( 419 ) . If cable ﬂow is driven primarily by actin polymerization , as suggested , this corresponds to addition of (cid:3) 100 subunits / s at ﬁlament ends , requiring a cellular concentration of (cid:3) 9 (cid:2) M G - actin . However , the total concentration of actin in yeast cells is estimated to be 12 (cid:2) M ( A . Goodman and B . Goode , unpub - lished data ) , the majority of which is thought to be in ﬁlamen - tous form ( 178 ) . Thus , the G - actin concentration in yeast cy - tosol should be well below 5 (cid:2) M . These discrepancies can begin to be reconciled by considering the formin / proﬁlin - de - pendent increase in elongation rates . Further , this may explain why measured rates of actin assembly at patches ( 0 . 05 to 0 . 1 (cid:2) m / s ) are markedly lower than cable ﬂow rates ( 173 , 174 ) . Although it is now clear that the FH1 domain serves as a throttle controlling the speed of elongation at formin - capped ﬁlaments , the mechanism remains to be determined . One pos - sibility is that proﬁlin presents monomers in an orientation optimal for their addition to barbed ends . It is thought that only about 2 % of random collisions between an actin monomer and the free barbed end of a ﬁlament result in effective docking and addition ( 83 ) . FH1 – proﬁlin – G - actin interactions may in - crease the efﬁciency of this step . A second possibility , not mutually exclusive from the ﬁrst , is that proﬁlin - FH1 interac - tions may increase the concentration of G - actin near the barbed end of the ﬁlament to increase the rate of elongation . The stage is set for testing these models . Another critical aspect of the mechanism that should be tested is whether the FH1 directly transfers proﬁlin - bound monomers to the barbed end , as suggested by a recent kinetic modeling study ( 380 ) . Bud6 : stimulation of Bni1 - mediated actin assembly . Bud6 ( also called Aip3 ) was ﬁrst identiﬁed in both a yeast two - hybrid screen for a ctin - i nteracting p roteins ( 13 ) and a genetic screen for mutants defective in the bipolar budding pattern ( 426 ) . Bud6 localization in cells is similar to that of Bni1 ( 14 , 284 ) , and bud6 (cid:4) cells show defects in formin - mediated actin cable assembly ( 99 , 325 ) . Further , in two - hybrid assays Bud6 has been shown to interact with Bni1 ( 97 ) and Bnr1 ( 182 ) . Subse - quent biochemical work demonstrated that the C - terminal half of Bud6 ( i ) binds speciﬁcally to actin monomers but not ﬁla - ments , ( ii ) stimulates nucleotide exchange on G - actin , and ( iii ) enhances Bni1 - mediated actin assembly in vitro additively with proﬁlin ( 253 ) . Consistent with these effects , bud6 (cid:4) was found to be synthetic lethal with pfy1 - 4 , suggesting that Bud6 and proﬁlin have related and / or complementary cellular functions . Subsequently , the Bud6 - binding site was mapped to a short sequence in the C terminus of Bni1 , overlapping with its DAD ( 251 ) , raising the possibility that Bud6 may participate in ac - tivating Bni1 from an inhibited state ( see below ) . Although Bud6 interactions with both Bni1 and Bnr1 were detected in the two - hybrid studies above , biochemical assays could detect interactions of Bud6 speciﬁcally with Bni1 and not Bnr1 . Fur - ther , mutational analysis revealed that key residues in Bni1 required for Bud6 binding are not conserved in Bnr1 . Actin assembly assays conﬁrmed this differential interaction ; Bud6 stimulates Bni1 activity by (cid:3) 2 - to 3 - fold but has no effect on Bnr1 activity . Further mechanistic studies will be required to determine precisely how Bud6 enhances Bni1 - mediated actin assembly , which in principle could arise from enhanced nucle - ation and / or elongation . Multiple lines of genetic evidence indicate additional cellu - lar functions for Bud6 beyond Bni1 stimulation . For example , bud6 (cid:4) cells have more severe defects in actin organization than bni1 (cid:4) cells , suggesting that Bud6 may contribute ( di - rectly or indirectly ) to the regulation of Bnr1 and / or other actin organizing factors . Further , Bud6 has roles in captur - ing astral microtubules to regulate mitotic spindle orienta - tion ( 160 , 338 , 339 ) and in organization of the endoplasmic reticulum at the bud neck to compartmentalize mother and daughter cells ( 226 ) . Rho GTPases . The localized assembly of yeast actin cables and cytokinetic rings by Bni1 and Bnr1 necessitates tight spa - tial and temporal control of their activities . Thus , one critical question is how Bni1 and Bnr1 actin assembly activities are up - regulated and down - regulated . Work on mammalian form - ins mDia1 and mDia2 has shown that they are auto - inhibited by interactions between their amino - terminal DID motif and their carboxyl - terminal DAD region ( 8 , 392 ) ( Fig . 11A ) , and these interactions abolish actin nucleation activity of the FH2 ( 212 ) . Many formins also contain an amino - terminal GBD adja - cent to the DID ( 211 , 322 ) . Direct binding of Rho GTPases to the GBD is proposed to release formins from an auto - inhibited state ( 8 , 392 ) . However , inhibition of mDia1 FH2 activity by DID is only minimally relieved by addition of RhoA ( 211 , 212 ) , suggesting other and / or more mechanisms may be required for formin activation . The overexpression of N - and C - terminally truncated Bni1 and Bnr1 constructs produces excess actin assembly in vivo ( 97 , 99 , 304 , 325 ) , which has led to the suggestion that Bni1 and Bnr1 may be auto - inhibited like mDia1 and mDia2 . This is consistent with conservation in Bni1 ( and to a lesser degree Bnr1 ) of the key functional residues in DAD ( 8 ) . However , it should be noted that the critical DAD - binding residues in DID are not conserved in Bni1 ( 203 , 267 ) and that direct interac - tions between N and C termini have not been reported for either Bni1 or Bnr1 . This leaves open the question of whether Bni1 and / or Bnr1 is auto - inhibited , which should be addressed 628 MOSELEY AND GOODE M ICROBIOL . M OL . B IOL . R EV . on N o v e m be r 1 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / mm b r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m through biochemical analyses of full - length proteins . Regardless of whether Bni1 and Bnr1 are down - regulated by auto - inhibition or alternative mechanisms ( e . g . , transinhibition similar to that of Las17 ) , Rho GTPases play key roles in yeast formin regulation in vivo . Six different Rho family GTPases are expressed in budding yeast : Rho1 , Rho2 , Rho3 , Rho4 , Rho5 , and Cdc42 . Bni1 interacts with Cdc42 , Rho1 , and possibly Rho3 and Rho4 ( 97 , 190 ) , while Bnr1 binds Rho4 ( 164 ) . Bni1 localization depends on Cdc42 ( 284 , 304 ) . Further , Dong and coworkers have addressed the functional importance of formin - Rho interactions by testing the ability of N - terminally truncated ( activated ) Bni1 and Bnr1 constructs to suppress defects caused by rho mutants at different stages of the cell cycle ( 79 ) . Their work implicates Cdc42 in the control of formin - mediated actin assembly at bud emergence , Rho3 and Rho4 during bud growth , and Rho1 during the response to cell stress . Another study implicates Rho1 in regulating Bni1 - me - diated actin assembly at the cytokinetic ring ( 369 ) . These stud - ies have made an important contribution by providing working functional pathways for formin regulation by Rho GTPases , but they leave open the possibility that some of the observed effects are not direct . Thus , biochemical evidence for the ef - fects of Rho GTPases on formin activity is needed to clarify the functional roles of these interactions . Other Bni1 and Bnr1 ligands . A number of other cellular factors interact with Bni1 and / or Bnr1 , for which the functional implications of the interactions are poorly understood . Tef1 ( eEF1 (cid:8) homologue ) is a highly abundant translation elonga - tion factor that interacts with Bni1 FH2 ( residues 1328 to 1513 ) ( 374 ) , binds to and bundles F - actin in vitro ( 76 , 262 ) , and contributes to actin cable organization ( 132 ) . Binding of a Bni1 fragment to Tef1 disrupts Tef1 bundling of F - actin ( 374 ) , but the effects of Tef1 on Bni1 activity have not been investigated . Interestingly , overexpression of TEF1 induces formation of supernumerary actin cables and enlarged depolarized cells ( 261 ) , similar to the effects of overexpressing dominant formin constructs . As Tef1 is one of the most abundant proteins in yeast cells ( 55 ) and may link functions of the actin cytoskeleton and translational control , it will be of great interest to deﬁne the effects of the Bni1 - Tef1 interaction . Additional factors that may affect formin function include Hof1 , Spa2 , and Smy1 . Hof1 , an SH3 domain - containing pro - tein of the PCH family ( 216 ) , interacts with Bnr1 FH1 by the two - hybrid assay and localizes to the bud neck similarly to Bnr1 ( 176 ) . Genetic data also suggest that Hof1 may regulate Bnr1 function at the bud neck ( 215 , 378 ) . Hof1 is proposed to me - diate septum formation to facilitate cytokinesis , rather than actomyosin ring formation ( 33 ) , and thus Hof1 could regulate Bnr1 - mediated cable assembly to promote septation . Another formin ligand , Spa2 , appears to interact with Bni1 , as Bnr1 lacks the Spa2 - binding domain ( 113 ) ( Fig . 11A ) . Spa2 is re - quired for proper localization of Bni1 ( 284 ) , but its potential effects on Bni1 activity have not been tested . The kinesin - related protein Smy1 interacts by two - hybrid assay with Bnr1 FH2 ( 182 ) , but no functional role for this interaction has yet been reported . Intriguingly , Smy1 also interacts with type V myosin Myo2 ( 28 ) , providing a possible link between cable assembly by Bnr1 and transport on cables . Organization and Stabilization of Actin Filaments Bundling proteins . The distinct functions of cellular actin arrays require organization of actin ﬁlaments into specialized architectures ( e . g . , patches , cables , and rings ) . This is regulated by proteins that bundle , cross - link , and / or stabilize ﬁlaments into specialized conﬁgurations . Below , we discuss the known mechanisms and cellular functions of yeast actin - binding pro - teins that bundle and / or stabilize ﬁlaments : Sac6 , Scp1 , Iqg1 , Crn1 , Abp140 , Tef1 , Tef2 , Tpm1 / Tpm2 , and Cap1 / Cap2 . ( i ) Sac6 . Sac6 has two actin - binding domains ( ABDs ) , each comprised of a pair of calponin homology ( CH ) domains ( Fig . 12 ) . True to its initial codiscovery by genetic ( 4 ) and biochem - ical ( 84 ) approaches , a deeper understanding of the Sac6 - actin interaction has developed through the combination of genetic and biochemical studies . Initially , SAC6 was identiﬁed as an extragenic suppressor of temperature - sensitive act1 alleles , in which point mutations in Sac6 suppressed the growth defects caused by point mutations in actin ( 4 , 5 ) . Independently , Sac6 was isolated on F - actin afﬁnity columns and shown to localize in vivo to patches and cables ( 84 ) . Then , it was demonstrated that Sac6 bundles F - actin in vitro and is required for proper actin organization in vivo ( 3 ) . Subsequent genetic and bio - chemical analyses demonstrated that Sac6 contacts residues on the surface of actin subdomains 1 and 2 exposed on the “edge” of the actin ﬁlament ( 46 , 154 ) . Further , some of the defects observed in sac6 (cid:4) cells ( e . g . , synthetic lethality with abp1 (cid:4) and sla2 (cid:4) ) are mimicked by mutations at the Sac6 contacts in actin subdomains 1 and 2 ( 153 , 329 ) . To date , the cognate actin - binding surfaces on Sac6 have not been identiﬁed , despite the availability of Sac6 / ﬁmbrin crystal structures to guide muta - tional analyses ( 123 , 189 ) . All actin - bundling proteins cross - link ﬁlaments by one of two mechanisms : ( i ) having multiple ABDs or ( ii ) oligomer - ization . Sac6 bundles ﬁlaments by having two separate ABDs . High - resolution EM studies on Sac6 - decorated ﬁlaments agree with previous genetic work deﬁning the Sac6 - actin interface and provide a model for the cross - link ( 135 , 136 , 386 ) . Until recently , it was thought that Sac6 was not regulated and that its two actin - binding heads were available to interact with ﬁla - ments . However , recent crystal structures of A . thaliana and S . pombe Sac6 / ﬁmbrin reveal a “closed” conformation , in which the two ABDs fold in on each other , preventing exposure of residues hypothesized to mediate actin binding ( 189 ) . This suggests that an induced structural shift may be required for actin binding to occur . Consistent with this possibility , distinct conformations for Sac6 have been observed by EM and crys - tallographic studies , but how such rearrangements might be regulated is not yet clear . One possibility is that the EF - hand motif in Sac6 / ﬁmbrin ( Fig . 12 ) allows regulation by calcium and / or other signaling molecules . While key features of the Sac6 - actin interaction now are understood , the cellular function ( s ) of Sac6 remains unclear . For instance , Sac6 function in endocytosis has not been re - solved . Actin patches in sac6 (cid:4) cells are impaired in moving inward from the cell cortex ( 174 ) , suggesting that Sac6 may contribute to actin - based force generation , but the mechanism of this contribution is unknown . Further , how does a bundling protein associate with a network of branched ﬁlaments such as an actin patch ? Perhaps Sac6 bundles ﬁlaments at speciﬁc V OL . 70 , 2006 MECHANISM AND FUNCTION OF THE YEAST ACTIN CYTOSKELETON 629 on N o v e m be r 1 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / mm b r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m stages in patch maturation , either prior to or subsequent to the stage characterized by EM where bundles are not obvious ( 314 , 423 ) . Additionally , Sac6 bundling may be used to link patches and cables during fast patch movement on cables ( 159 ) . An - other possibility that should be considered is that the abilities of Sac6 to bundle and stabilize ﬁlaments may be separate . Thus , Sac6 could function primarily to stabilize rather than bundle ﬁlaments in patches . Consistent with this model , par - tially puriﬁed actin patches isolated from sac6 (cid:4) cells are less stable than those isolated from wild - type cells ( 423 ) . To resolve these issues , mutants that speciﬁcally impair each of the ABDs of Sac6 should be generated , and actin patch ultrastructure in sac6 (cid:4) mutants should be analyzed by EM to determine whether there are visible defects in ﬁlament organization . The precise function of Sac6 in actin cables is also unknown . sac6 (cid:4) cells show diminished cable staining and rounded cell morphologies , indicative of polarity defects ( 3 ) . Thus , Sac6 may bundle and / or stabilize the actin ﬁlaments in cables . How - ever , this has not been tested directly , for instance , by measur - ing rates of cable turnover in sac6 (cid:4) cells . Finally , a functional role for Sac6 at the actomyosin ring has not been investigated . S . pombe ﬁmbrin localizes to the medial ring and functions during cytokinesis ( 412 ) , raising the possibility that Sac6 func - tions similarly . ( ii ) Scp1 . Scp1 ( a calponin / transgelin homologue ) is the only other component of patches or cables ( other than Sac6 ) that contains a CH domain ; in addition , the bud neck component Iqg1 contains a CH domain ( see below ) . Like Sac6 , Scp1 lo - calizes to actin patches and bundles and stabilizes actin ﬁla - ments in vitro ( 129 , 405 ) . Deletion of SCP1 exacerbates defects caused by deletion of SAC6 , further suggesting their functional relationship . However , biochemical dissection of Scp1 activity reveals clear mechanistic differences between these two bun - dlers . First , Sac6 bundles ﬁlaments through the use of two ABDs , each comprised of a pair of CH domains . However , Scp1 bundles ﬁlaments through C - terminal sequences distinct from its CH domain ( Fig . 12 ) . This relatively small C - terminal region of Scp1 is both required and sufﬁcient for bundling but does not appear to oligomerize , leaving its bundling mecha - nism uncertain . One possibility is that this fragment harbors two separate ABDs . Alternatively , actin binding may alter the conformation of Scp1 to promote oligomerization ( similar to IQGAP [ see below ] ) . Scp1 - induced actin ﬁlament bundles also are qualitatively distinct from Sac6 - induced bundles , consistent with their apparently divergent actin interactions . Scp1 has not been visualized on actin cables or rings , but its relatively low abundance compared to Sac6 may preclude vi - sualization on those structures . Indeed , even the more abun - dant Sac6 shows only faint localization on cables ( 84 ) . Thus , it is an open possibility that Scp1 and Sac6 function together to regulate cables . Scp1 also is linked to formation of reactive oxygen species regulating yeast cell death ( 130 ) , but it is not yet clear whether this function requires Scp1 interactions with actin . Key to understanding Scp1 cellular function will be de - termining the respective roles of its N - terminal CH domain and C - terminal actin - bundling domain . It is possible that the CH domain functions as a “locator” domain to facilitate activ - ity of the C terminus . Alternatively , the CH domain may me - diate interactions with other cellular factors . Thus , future work on Scp1 should ( i ) deﬁne which domains of Scp1 are required for its localization and ( ii ) identify new Scp1 ligands . ( iii ) Iqg1 / Cyk1 . A third CH domain - containing protein in yeast is Iqg1 ( also called Cyk1 ) , an IQGAP homologue . Most IQGAP family members have a CH domain at their N termi - nus , calmodulin - binding IQ motifs , and a C - terminal Ras - GAP domain ( RGD ) . The RGD mediates interactions with Cdc42 but lacks the GAP activity originally proposed ( Fig . 12 ) ( 228 ) . Cdc42 and Iqg1 two - hybrid interactions have been reported ( 279 ) , but interactions could not be detected biochemically between Iqg1 and any of the yeast Rho GTPases ( 96 , 341 ) , leaving open whether Iqg1 is regulated in this manner . The IQG1 gene is essential for yeast cell growth , and Iqg1 localizes FIG . 12 . Actin ﬁlament - bundling proteins . Schematics of each protein are drawn to scale . Abbreviations : CC , coiled - coil ; CLR , calponin - like repeat ; COOH , carboxyl - terminal domain . Known actin - binding domains are underlined . Yeast IQGAP ( Iqg1 ) is included because mammalian IQGAP bundles actin ﬁlaments ; however , this activity has not yet been demonstrated for yeast Iqg1 . It is unknown how Abp140 bundles actin ﬁlaments , since its actin - binding domain ( s ) has not been deﬁned . 630 MOSELEY AND GOODE M ICROBIOL . M OL . B IOL .

The terminal phe - notype of iqg1 (cid:4) cells suggests that it plays a critical role in cytokinesis . Iqg1 binds to F - actin through its N terminus , which contains the CH domain ( 96 , 341 ) . Filament bundling by Iqg1 has not been tested . However , mammalian IQGAPs bundle ﬁlaments , and this activity is regulated by their interactions with Cdc42 and calmodulin . Cdc42 - GTP enhances bundling , possibly by promoting IQGAP oligomerization ( 114 ) , whereas calmodulin inhibits bundling ( 26 ) . One implication from these studies is that IQGAP likely bundles via oligomerization , rather than utilizing multiple ABDs on a single polypeptide chain . Since Iqg1 interacts with calmodulin and Mlc1 ( 341 , 342 ) , and even possibly Cdc42 , it may be regulated in a similar manner , but this awaits future tests . What speciﬁc cellular function does Iqg1 perform to pro - mote cytokinesis ? Truncation analyses show that the CH do - main contributes to assembly of the actomyosin ring , that the IQ motifs are required for Iqg1 recruitment to the bud neck ( via interactions with Mlc1 ) , and that the RGD facilitates con - traction of the actomyosin ring ( 341 ) . This puts Iqg1 at the center of a fascinating network of interactions driving cell division . However , the mechanisms by which Iqg1 facilitates actin ring formation and subsequent ring contraction remain unclear . Does the CH domain interact directly with actin ﬁla - ments to promote ring formation , or are there other ligands involved ? What molecular interaction ( s ) of the Rho - binding domain promotes ring contraction ? ( iv ) Crn1 . Here , we discuss the actin - binding and - bundling activities of Crn1 ( yeast coronin ) ; its role in regulating the Arp2 / 3 complex is described above . The N terminus of Crn1 forms a (cid:7) - propeller domain that mediates a high - afﬁnity inter - action with F - actin ; the C terminus contains a coiled - coil do - main ( Fig . 12 ) . Puriﬁed Crn1 oligomerizes via its coiled - coil domain and cross - links ﬁlaments into either loose arrays of overlapping short ﬁlaments or smooth bundles of longer ﬁla - ments ( 128 ) . Overexpression of Crn1 in yeast causes arrest of cell growth , which can be suppressed by truncating either the ABD or the coiled - coil domain . Crn1 localization to actin patches also depends on both domains ( 161 ) . Thus , Crn1 lo - calization and function may depend on its ability to bundle F - actin . Alternatively , this may reﬂect a requirement for Crn1 interactions with the Arp2 / 3 complex , also mediated by the coiled - coil domain ( 161 ) . Since there appear to be separate pools of Crn1 in cells—about 50 % of which is associated with the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 161 ) —Crn1 may be performing multiple functions that involve its coiled - coil domain . Deletion of CRN1 causes no obvious defects in cell growth , morphology , or actin organization , suggesting its functions are redundant with other cellular factors . However , Crn1 shows no genetic interactions with other bundling proteins ( Sac6 , Scp1 , and Abp140 ) . Instead , crn1 (cid:4) displays synthetic defects in cell growth and actin organization with act1 - 159 and cof1 - 22 . This raises the intriguing possibility that Crn1 may promote actin turnover rather than stabilization ( 128 ) . These and other ques - tions regarding Crn1 cellular function need to be resolved . ( v ) Abp140 . Abp140 is one of only two actin - binding proteins identiﬁed in yeast with no obvious mammalian counterpart , the other being Bud6 ( Table 1 ) . Abp140 was ﬁrst puriﬁed from crude yeast cell extracts as a 140 - kDa protein with actin - bun - dling activity ( 17 ) . However , the ABP140 open reading frame predicts a protein with a calculated mass of 71 kDa . This suggests either that Abp140 has abnormal properties that cause retarded migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacryl - amide gel electrophoresis gels or that it oligomerizes in a manner resistant to the denaturing conditions of sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels . The migration of Abp140 on gel ﬁltration columns is consistent with oligomerization ( 17 ) . Thus , while the ABDs of Abp140 have not yet been identiﬁed , this protein appears to multim - erize , which offers a potential mechanism for bundling . Abp140 localizes to both actin patches and cables . However , abp140 (cid:4) cells display no defects in cell growth , morphology , or actin organization . Genetic interactions of Abp140 with other actin - binding factors have not been tested , leaving its cellular function unclear . Since its initial characterization , Abp140 has been used as a GFP - fused marker for studies monitoring actin cable dynamics ( 104 , 159 , 419 ) . As multiple bundling proteins colocalize with patches and cables ( e . g . , Abp140 and Sac6 and possibly Scp1 ) , an important mechanistic question is whether these factors compete for and / or cooperate in binding F - actin and help connect patches and cables . In addition , cable architecture likely is shaped by the activities of multiple bundling factors working in concert . ( vi ) Tef1 and Tef2 . Tef1 and Tef2 are the yeast homologues of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 (cid:8) ( EF1 (cid:8) ) , and they bear 81 % sequence identity to their human counterpart ( 374 ) . Tef1 and Tef2 are identical proteins , encoded by genet - ically redundant genes , that together are essential for cell via - bility ( 333 ) . In addition to their well - documented roles in pro - tein translation , all EF1 (cid:8) family members examined ( from yeast to humans ) bundle F - actin in vitro ( 67 ) . In addition , Xenopus laevis and human EF1 (cid:8) proteins sever microtubules ( 347 ) . Thus , Tef1 has the potential to coordinate protein trans - lation with functions of both the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons . Filament bundling was ﬁrst demonstrated for Dictyostelium discoideum EF1 (cid:8) ( 418 ) and more recently for Tef1 ( 261 ) . The bundling mechanism of Tef1 likely involves two separate ABDs , which have been mapped to two distinct 50 - residue stretches , located at the N and C termini of Dictyostelium EF1 (cid:8) ( 218 ) . EF1 (cid:8) bundles actin ﬁlaments into a unique architecture that excludes other cross - linking proteins from binding ( 283 ) . Point mutations that disrupt the ability of Tef1 to bundle ﬁlaments , but leave its translation function unaffected , cause defects in actin cable organization in vivo ( 132 ) . However , it remains unknown whether Tef1 localizes to cables or other F - actin structures , and thus it is unclear how it contributes to cable organization . As discussed above , Tef1 interacts with the actin - nucleating FH2 domain of Bni1 , and this interaction dis - rupts F - actin bundling by Tef1 ( 374 ) . However , it remains to be determined whether this interaction affects the actin cable assembly - promoting activity of Bni1 . Another reported ligand of Tef1 is the actin monomer - binding protein Srv2 / CAP ( see below ) ( 417 ) , but the in vitro and in vivo consequences of this interaction remain unknown . Finally , it will be interesting to learn how the functions of Tef1 in regulating the actin cytoskeleton are coordinated with V OL . 70 , 2006 MECHANISM AND FUNCTION OF THE YEAST ACTIN CYTOSKELETON 631 on N o v e m be r 1 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / mm b r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m its classical role in translation . The role of EF1 (cid:8) in translation requires GTP binding and hydrolysis ( 168 , 312 ) . F - actin bind - ing inhibits the abilities of EF1 (cid:8) to bind GTP but promotes GTP hydrolysis ( 90 ) . Thus , actin binding may drive EF1 (cid:8) into the GDP - bound form , inactive for translation . Nonbundling Actin Stabilizers ( i ) Tropomyosins Tpm1 and Tpm2 . Budding yeast express two tropomyosin isoforms , TPM1 and TPM2 , which function primarily to stabilize the ﬁlaments in actin cables and the actomyosin ring . Intriguingly , they are the only proteins known to localize exclusively to cables , i . e . , not also label patches . Tpm1 and Tpm2 have genetically overlapping yet possibly dis - tinct cellular functions . TPM1 expression levels are (cid:3) 6 times higher than TPM2 levels in exponentially growing cells ( 81 ) , which correlates with the relative severity of their phenotypes . Whereas tpm1 (cid:4) cells lack readily detectable cables , have cell morphology defects , and grow slowly ( 219 ) , tpm2 (cid:4) cells show no obvious defects in growth , morphology , or actin organiza - tion ( 81 ) . Further , overexpression of TPM2 rescues most of the defects caused by tpm1 (cid:4) ( D . Pruyne and A . Bretscher , per - sonal communication ) . The observation that tpm1 (cid:4) and tpm2 (cid:4) mutations are synthetic lethal is consistent with genetic redun - dancy in their functions but also leaves open the possibility that they perform some speciﬁc roles , as suggested by their bio - chemical differences ( below ) . Tpm1 and Tpm2 display many of the deﬁning biochemical properties of tropomyosin family members , including dimer - ization , divalent cation - dependent F - actin binding , and resis - tance to denaturation at high temperatures ( 90°C ) ( 61 , 81 , 220 ) . However , Tpm1 and Tpm2 have different actin - binding stoichiometries ( 1 Tpm1 dimer per 4 . 6 actin subunits ; 1 Tpm2 dimer per 3 . 6 subunits ) . Further , Tpm2 can displace Tpm1 from actin ﬁlaments , but Tpm1 fails to displace Tpm2 from ﬁlaments . Additionally , low levels of Tpm1 may actually en - hance Tpm2 binding ( 81 ) . This suggests that Tpm2 may have stronger afﬁnity for F - actin and that its actin - binding interac - tion is qualitatively distinct from that of Tpm1 . A future chal - lenge is to determine how these biochemical differences trans - late into different cellular functions . This will likely require careful analysis of cable dynamics in tpm1 and tpm2 mutants and identiﬁcation of differential genetic interactions for these mutants . As discussed earlier , the generation of a fast - acting temper - ature - sensitive strain , tpm1 - 2 tpm2 (cid:4) , greatly facilitated the dis - covery that tropomyosin is required for cable stability ( 306 ) . Tpm1 and Tpm2 may stabilize cables by prohibiting depoly - merization / turnover factors , such as coﬁlin , from associating with ﬁlaments . Consistent with this view , ﬁlament binding by tropomyosin and coﬁlin are mutually exclusive in vitro and in Caenor habditis elegans muscle cells ( 30 , 278 ) . This is also consistent with the observation that yeast patches and cables are decorated differentially by coﬁlin ( patches ) and tropomy - osin ( cables ) . As actin cables are highly dynamic structures that undergo rapid ﬁlament turnover ( 19 , 419 ) , it will be important to determine whether tropomyosin - actin interactions are reg - ulated . It seems likely that maintaining rapid turnover of cables would require active mechanisms to displace these ﬁlament stabilizers . Indeed , such mechanisms have begun to emerge ; Tpm1 ( and likely Tpm2 ) is acetylated directly by the Mdm20 - containing NatB acetyltransferase complex , and this modiﬁca - tion promotes Tpm1 binding to F - actin and cable stability in vivo ( 146 , 292 , 350 , 351 ) . This and other modiﬁcations , as well as competitive inhibitor mechanisms , may be required to main - tain the delicate balance between cable stability and rapid turnover . ( ii ) Capping protein . All of the ﬁlament - stabilizing factors discussed above ( e . g . , Sac6 , Scp1 , and Tpm1 / Tpm2 ) decorate sides of ﬁlaments and reduce rates of subunit dissociation as ﬁlaments shorten from their barbed and / or pointed ends . How - ever , factors that directly target ﬁlament ends can also have tremendous stabilizing effects . It is difﬁcult to ﬁnd a more classic example of this than the CapZ / conventional capping protein family , of which yeast capping protein ( Cap1 / Cap2 ) is a member . These heterodimeric proteins tightly associate with and cap the barbed ends of actin ﬁlaments ( 396 ) . Cap1 / Cap2 localizes to actin patches , and strains carrying deletions in the CAP1 and / or CAP2 genes show depolarized patches and di - minished cable staining ( 10 , 11 ) . The potential role of capping protein in regulating cable stability has not yet been addressed . However , recent studies show that capping protein plays an important role in driving actin polymerization to facilitate slow actin patch movements ( Fig . 4 ) ( 174 , 185 ) . This effect may be explained by capping protein limiting the local concentration of free barbed ends of ﬁlaments to “funnel” available actin monomers to these barbed ends ( i . e . , those that are not capped ) ( 287 ) . This increases the rate of actin polymerization at these free ends , because the monomer pool is not depleted as rapidly and polymerization rates depend on monomer concentration . Another important function that capping protein provides in actin networks is regulation of average ﬁlament length . By rapidly associating with free barbed ends of ﬁlaments , capping protein limits ﬁlament growth and thereby maintains a short average ﬁlament length . This is a critical property for the organization of dense actin networks comprised of many in - terconnected very short ﬁlaments , such as those found at the leading edge of motile cells , in the actin “comet tails” trailing intracellular vesicles and pathogens , or in yeast actin patches . Since capping protein is ubiquitously expressed and relatively abundant , the assembly of alternative actin arrays comprised of somewhat longer ﬁlaments ( e . g . , ﬁlopodia , stress ﬁbers , and cables ) requires that the ﬁlament length restrictions imposed by capping protein be actively bypassed . This is achieved by two mechanisms . First , capping protein can be regulated at the cell cortex by direct interactions with PIP 2 , which disrupts capping protein associations with barbed ends ( 332 ) . Second , factors such as formins or Ena / VASP associate with the grow - ing barbed ends of ﬁlaments ( processive capping ) and protect those growing ends from capping protein . What is the mechanism for capping ﬁlament barbed ends ? The recently solved crystal structure of vertebrate CapZ re - veals that the two subunits , which have almost no similarity in primary sequence , fold into remarkably similar structures that intertwine ( 415 ) . Each subunit has at its C terminus a short “tentacle” that protrudes from the main structural body of the protein , and mutational analysis shows that both tentacles con - tribute to capping in vitro . Further , mutations in the Cap1 tentacle cause cellular defects similar to those caused by the 632 MOSELEY AND GOODE M ICROBIOL . M OL . B IOL . R EV . on N o v e m be r 1 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / mm b r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m null mutations ( 186 ) . Intriguingly , the Cap1 tentacle makes a much stronger contribution to capping than the Cap2 tentacle ( 186 , 397 ) . Further , the Cap1 tentacle is sufﬁcient to cap ﬁla - ments , albeit with far lower afﬁnity than intact capping protein ( 186 ) . Ultimately , a full biochemical understanding of the cap - ping mechanism will require identiﬁcation of the tentacle bind - ing sites on actin , which have only been modeled to date and not determined experimentally ( 396 ) . Rapid Turnover of Actin Structures Importance of actin turnover in vivo . Although much re - search attention has been placed on deﬁning the cellular mech - anisms for assembling actin ﬁlaments within networks , the rapid disassembly of ﬁlaments is equally important . Only by maintaining actin networks in a state of dynamic ﬂux , with individual ﬁlaments undergoing regulated turnover , are cells able to remodel their networks swiftly in response to internal and external cues ( e . g . , during cell motility and cytokinesis ) and coordinate time - sensitive steps in complex actin - depen - dent processes ( e . g . , endocytosis ) . In addition , new growth of actin ﬁlaments relies on the rapid and steady turnover of older ﬁlaments , which is required to replenish the monomer pool . Thus , reduced rates of ﬁlament turnover deplete the monomer pool and limit new growth . All three major actin structures in yeast ( patches , cables , and rings ) undergo rapid turnover , as demonstrated by the loss of all visible F - actin staining within 1 minute after treatment of cells with Lat - A ( 19 , 369 ) . As Lat - A is reported to block new ﬁlament growth but not actively disassemble ﬁlaments , this suggests that the ﬁlaments in patches , cables , and rings un - dergo rapid turnover . The importance of rapid actin turnover for cell function was ﬁrst demonstrated in studies employing the cof1 - 22 conditional mutant ( 204 ) . This mutation impairs the actin disassembly activity of Cof1 in vitro and dramatically reduces in vivo turnover rates of actin ﬁlaments in patches . This study showed a correlation between reduced rates of actin turnover and defects in endocytosis and cell growth . Similar results were reached in studies on act1 - 159 , demonstrating a correlation between reduced rates of actin ﬁlament disassem - bly in vitro and reduced rates of actin turnover in vivo , accom - panied by defects in endocytosis ( 27 ) . Together , these studies strongly indicate that rapid turnover of actin is required for endocytosis and cell viability . Most growth of actin networks in vivo occurs at the barbed ends of ﬁlaments , and disassembly is thought to occur primar - ily by dissociation of subunits from the pointed ends of ﬁla - ments . However , the rate of dissociation of subunits from pointed ends is very low ( 0 . 3 to 0 . 8 subunits per s ) . Since rates of ﬁlament turnover in vivo are up to 100 times higher ( 428 ) , this means that cells require active mechanisms for disassem - bling ﬁlaments . In yeast , as in other organisms , this is achieved through the coordinated activities of multiple actin - binding proteins working in concert . Below we describe the mecha - nisms and functions of each yeast actin - binding protein known to promote actin turnover . All of these proteins are highly conserved and , therefore , their mechanisms are likely to be conserved . Coﬁlin / ADF . Budding yeast has a single essential coﬁlin gene ( COF1 ) , which encodes a small ( 16 - kDa ) protein with properties similar to other members of the ADF / coﬁlin family ( 25 , 162 , 246 ) . The primary cellular function of coﬁlin is to accelerate actin ﬁlament depolymerization and turnover ( 204 ) ; however , the biochemical mechanism underlying this activity is not yet fully understood . Coﬁlin binds to actin ﬁlaments and monomers in vitro , in both cases preferentially interacting with ADP - bound versus ATP - bound actin ( 141 ) . Coﬁlin induces ﬁlament fragmentation , which structural studies suggest is achieved by twisting of the ﬁlament to weaken lateral contacts between actin subunits ( 39 , 241 ) . As coﬁlin binds cooperatively to F - actin ( 140 , 141 ) , it may cluster at multiple sites along a ﬁlament , with nonuniform decoration leading to severing events . The other reported activity of coﬁlin , acceleration of subunit dissociation from ﬁlament pointed ends ( 51 ) , could in principle also stem from ﬁlament twisting . Importantly , sever - ing by coﬁlin has the potential to promote either assembly or disassembly of ﬁlaments depending on the availability of actin monomers in cells and how efﬁciently the new barbed ends generated by severing are capped . What cellular function ( s ) requires the essential activities of yeast Cof1 ? Cof1 localizes to actin patches and has been shown to be required for endocytosis ( 204 , 205 , 246 ) . Although cof1 mutants have not yet been studied using time - lapse imaging for defects in patch maturation , it seems likely that cof1 - 22 mu - tants will show defects in early slow patch movements , similar to capping protein mutants . Requirements at this phase of patch development seem to mirror those of other systems that depend on rapid actin polymerization and turnover , such as Listeria motility ( 221 ) . In addition to its role in regulating actin turnover at patches , Cof1 may also play an unexpected role in driving actin cable dynamics . While Cof1 is detected speciﬁ - cally on actin patches in wild - type cells ( 246 ) , it localizes to both patches and cables in aip1 (cid:4) cells ( 317 ) . Further , recent functional studies show that coﬁlin ( and Aip1 ) promotes the rapid turnover of actin cables and that aip1 (cid:4) mutations sup - press the actin cable defects caused by deletion of TPM1 ( 276 ) . Finally , a recent study showed that S . pombe Adf1 localizes to and functions in formation and maintenance of the actomyosin ring ( 264 ) . Thus , Cof1 has the potential to regulate turnover of all the major actin structures in yeast cells : patches , cables , and rings . One major open question about Cof1 is whether its activities are regulated in vivo . The ability of animal coﬁlins to interact with actin is regulated tightly by phosphorylation of a con - served serine residue in the N terminus , subject to control by a cascade of kinases and phosphatases ( 404 ) . In yeast Cof1 , an S4E ( cof1 - 3 ) mutation of the analogous serine residue is lethal , suggesting that if phosphorylation occurred it would block ac - tin binding and coﬁlin function , similar to what is seen in animal cells . However , no phosphorylation of endogenous Cof1 ( isolated from exponentially growing cells ) could be de - tected , which has led to the suggestion that Cof1 may not be regulated ( 205 ) . One intriguing possibility , however , is that Cof1 may be down - regulated speciﬁcally when cells are not actively growing , such as in stationary phase . Another potential form of Cof1 regulation is pH change in the cytosol , as pH regulates the in vitro activities of coﬁlin / ADF proteins , includ - ing Cof1 ( 140 , 141 , 162 ) , inhibiting ﬁlament disassembly activ - ity at pH levels of (cid:6) 7 . 5 . However , it remains uncertain whether pH is regulated locally in yeast cells and , therefore , whether V OL . 70 , 2006 MECHANISM AND FUNCTION OF THE YEAST ACTIN CYTOSKELETON 633 on N o v e m be r 1 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / mm b r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m this regulatory mechanism contributes to Cof1 function in vivo . Finally , the activity of ADF / coﬁlins is down - regulated by direct interactions with PIP 2 ( 250 , 272 ) , which may have important implications for regulation of Cof1 at cortical sites , such as actin patches . Aip1 . Aip1 is an important binding partner and cofactor of coﬁlin that promotes actin ﬁlament disassembly and turnover . Aip1 was ﬁrst identiﬁed in a yeast two - hybrid screen for actin - interacting proteins ( 13 ) and later found as a coﬁlin - interacting factor through biochemical afﬁnity ( 275 ) , two - hybrid ( 317 ) , and genetic ( 163 ) approaches . Together , Aip1 and coﬁlin pro - mote net actin ﬁlament disassembly in vitro , and aip1 (cid:4) and cof1 mutations show genetic interactions ( 7 , 244 , 275 , 317 ) . Like coﬁlin , Aip1 localizes to actin patches ( 317 ) , where it has a demonstrated role in promoting rapid actin turnover ( 276 ) . Elucidation of the Aip1 mechanism has seen much recent progress . Aip1 caps the barbed ends of coﬁlin - severed ﬁla - ments to prevent ﬁlament reannealing and block elongation ( 23 , 274 ) and enhances the ﬁlament - severing activity of coﬁlin ( 277 ) . Structurally , Aip1 is comprised of two seven - bladed (cid:7) - propellers linked by a short hinge domain ( Fig . 13A ) ( 245 , 384 ) . Mutagenesis studies have deﬁned two actin - binding sur - faces on Aip1 that are critical for its functions in vitro and in vivo , one located on each (cid:7) - propeller ( 66 , 243 , 245 , 276 ) . The coﬁlin - binding surface lies in the hinge region of Aip1 located between the two actin - binding sites ( 66 ) . The C - terminal actin - binding site speciﬁcally recognizes coﬁlin - bound F - actin ( 276 ) . Since coﬁlin alters the twist of F - actin ( 241 ) and Aip1 pro - motes ﬁlament disassembly speciﬁcally in the presence of coﬁlin , this C - terminal actin - binding site may recognize a coﬁlin - induced conformational state of F - actin . These properties tai - lor Aip1 for capping coﬁlin - severed ﬁlaments and , indeed , mutation of the C - terminal actin - binding site abolishes Aip1’s coﬁlin - dependent activity . Taking these observations together , a model emerges for the Aip1 mechanism and function . Coﬁlin decorates the sides of ﬁlaments and helps recruit Aip1 , which binds directly to F - actin and coﬁlin . Together , coﬁlin and Aip1 induce ﬁlament severing to produce short fragments of F - actin ( less than 50 nm ) capped at their barbed ends by Aip1 . These fragments disassemble rapidly by the dissociation of subunits from their pointed ends . Until recently , Aip1 and coﬁlin were thought to promote actin turnover speciﬁcally at patches , owing to their localiza - tion to patches . However , as discussed in above ( see “Actin cable dynamics and turnover” ) , coﬁlin and Aip1 have recently been shown to promote rapid turnover of cables ( 276 ) . The rapid nature of the coﬁlin - Aip1 mechanism of disassembling ﬁlaments may explain why in wild - type cells coﬁlin and Aip1 are not detected on cables . Cables are faint to begin with , and if only a small percentage of ﬁlaments are decorated with coﬁlin , it would be difﬁcult to detect . In contrast , in aip1 (cid:4) cells , severing by coﬁlin produces uncapped barbed ends that undergo new polymerization , consistent with cable thickening and detection of coﬁlin on cables . This also ex - plains why thickened cables decorated with coﬁlin are ob - served in the cof1 - 19 strain , a mutant that disrupts barbed end capping by Aip1 ( 317 ) . Srv2 / CAP . Srv2 was initially identiﬁed in yeast as a s uppres - sor of the activated ras V 19 allele ( Srv2 ) and as an adenylyl c yclase - a ssociated p rotein ( CAP ) ( 103 , 107 ) .

( B ) Model for the sequential events in actin turnover . Coﬁlin ( orange ) binds cooperatively to and severs older ( ADP - bound ) actin ﬁlaments . Aip1 ( green ) interacts with coﬁlin and F - actin to cap the barbed ends of severed ﬁlaments . Aip1 - capped ﬁlaments disassemble rapidly from their pointed ends , generating a pool of coﬁlin - bound ADP - actin monomers that cannot exchange ATP for ADP . The dodecameric Srv2 complex ( blue ) , tethered to F - actin via the SH3 domain of Abp1 ( red ) , rapidly displaces coﬁlin and binds tightly to ADP – G - actin . This facilitates rapid nucleotide exchange ( ATP for ADP ) on actin . Srv2 has 100 - fold - lower afﬁnity for ATP – G - actin than ADP – G - actin and thus hands off ATP – G - actin to proﬁlin . Proﬁlin interacts directly with Srv2 and may accelerate nucleotide exchange on actin during this process . Proﬁlin - bound ATP - actin monomers are available for rapid addition onto the barbed ends of ﬁlaments .

R EV . on N o v e m be r 1 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / mm b r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m was named Srv2 , but homologues in other species are called CAP . Yeast Srv2 interacts with the adenylyl cyclase complex through a binding site in its N terminus , whereas the C termi - nus of the protein binds to actin monomers and plays a central role in regulation of actin dynamics in cells ( Fig . 13A ) ( 112 , 117 , 180 , 237 , 424 ) . The adenylyl cyclase - binding activity does not appear to be conserved in animals and plants , but its role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton is conserved in all Srv2 / CAPs tested so far ( 158 ) . Deletion of the SRV2 gene in yeast causes defects in cell growth and actin organization , and ex - pression of CAP homologues from diverse species rescues these defects . In addition , srv2 (cid:4) defects are suppressed par - tially by overexpression of proﬁlin , suggesting a relationship between their in vivo functions ( 385 ) . Until recently , the spe - ciﬁc function performed by Srv2 / CAP in the actin cytoskeleton was unknown . Recent studies have revealed that Srv2 / CAP promotes the rapid turnover of actin networks by recycling newly depolymer - ized actin monomers and coﬁlin ( 23 , 31 , 237 , 249 ) . After coﬁlin promotes ﬁlament disassembly , it remains bound to ADP - actin monomers and inhibits nucleotide exchange ( ATP for ADP ) ( 36 , 205 , 269 ) . This leads to the accumulation of a pool of coﬁlin - bound ADP - actin monomers , blocked from returning to an ATP - bound assembly - competent state . Therefore , cells re - quire a mechanism to displace coﬁlin from ADP - actin mono - mers . Classical models depict proﬁlin performing this function through competition ( 295 ) . However , proﬁlin fails to compete effectively with coﬁlin for binding to ADP – G - actin , suggesting that a “middle man” is required to facilitate exchange of actin monomers from coﬁlin to proﬁlin . Srv2 / CAP has been demon - strated to perform this function in vitro ( 23 ) . The C terminus of Srv2 / CAP binds to and promotes nucleotide exchange on actin monomers . Further , full - length Srv2 catalyzes the con - version of coﬁlin - bound ADP - actin monomers to proﬁlin - bound ATP - actin monomers . Thus , Srv2 / CAP promotes actin turnover by ( i ) recycling coﬁlin for new rounds of ﬁlament disassembly and ( ii ) facilitating nucleotide exchange on G - actin to replenish the assembly - competent monomer pool ( Fig . 13B ) ( 23 , 249 ) . More - recent studies have begun to deﬁne the mechanism underlying these effects ( 237 ) . The C terminus of Srv2 has an (cid:3) 100 - fold - higher afﬁnity for ADP – G - actin ( K d (cid:9) 0 . 02 (cid:2) M ) than ATP – G - actin ( K d (cid:9) 1 . 9 (cid:2) M ) , which enables it to compete for ADP – G - actin binding with coﬁlin ( K d (cid:9) 0 . 02 to 0 . 1 (cid:2) M coﬁlin ) ( 36 , 51 , 237 , 379 ) . Further , the N terminus of Srv2 may assist in these events , as it binds speciﬁcally to coﬁlin – G - actin complexes and is required for rapid conversion of coﬁlin - bound ADP – G - actin to proﬁlin - bound ATP – G - actin ( 23 , 249 ) . In this respect , it will be interesting to learn whether the N ter - minus of Srv2 has the ability to weaken coﬁlin - ADP - actin mono - mer interactions . Following transfer of ADP – G - actin from coﬁlin to Srv2 , rapid nucleotide exchange occurs on actin . However , Srv2 - bound ATP - actin monomers are not competent for addi - tion onto ﬁlament barbed ends ( 237 ) . This means that another handoff is required ( to proﬁlin ) . Addition of proﬁlin to Srv2 - bound G - actin releases monomers for addition onto barbed ends , suggesting a transfer has occurred ( 237 ) . Thus , Srv2 / CAP catalyzes conversion of actin monomers from the ADP - to ATP - bound state and , like many enzymes , Srv2 has a signiﬁ - cantly higher afﬁnity for its substrate ( ADP - actin ) than its product ( ATP - actin ) , which accelerates the reaction . One of the most fascinating properties of Srv2 / CAP , with likely implications for its cellular function and mechanism , is that it hexamerizes to form a high - molecular - weight complex . Native Srv2 complex isolated from yeast cells is (cid:3) 600 kDa , with a sedimentation coefﬁcient of 15S and dimensions of (cid:3) 15 by 30 nm long as determined by rotary shadowing EM of puriﬁed complexes ( 23 ) . The complex is comprised entirely of two proteins , Srv2 and actin , present at a 1 : 1 molar stoichiom - etry , suggesting a heterododecamer ( assembled from six Srv2 and six actin molecules ) . Each Srv2 molecule in the complex can interact with G - actin and at least three actin - binding pro - teins : coﬁlin , proﬁlin , and Abp1 . Binding of coﬁlin and proﬁlin may promote the handoffs described above . Binding of Abp1 is required for Srv2 localization to yeast actin patches ( 214 ) and tethers Srv2 complex to actin ﬁlaments in vitro ( 23 ) . Since the Abp1 - binding site on Srv2 is located in its C terminus , proximal to the G - actin - binding domain , it will be interesting to learn whether Abp1 also affects Srv2 activity . Taken together , these interactions suggest that the Srv2 complex may serve as a molecular hub to facilitate dynamic interactions among multi - ple proteins in promoting actin turnover . This concept raises important questions about the structure and physical proper - ties of the complex and how they inﬂuence function . For in - stance , what is the nucleotide - bound state of the actin subunits bound to the complex ? Do these subunits freely exchange with actin monomers in solution ? How are Srv2 and actin molecules arranged within the complex ? Is multimerization of Srv2 re - quired for its activities and in vivo functions ? Proﬁlin . Proﬁlin is a small ( (cid:3) 15 - kDa ) , ubiquitous , abundant actin monomer - binding protein , the biochemical activities of which have long been studied ( 409 ) . In all organisms examined , mutation of proﬁlin is lethal and / or causes severe defects in actin organization and cell morphology . In S . cerevisiae , a de - letion mutant ( pfy1 (cid:4) ) and point mutations that impair actin binding ( e . g . , pfy1 - 4 ) show that proﬁlin is critical for cell growth , morphology , and actin organization ( 134 , 410 ) . Association of proﬁlin with actin monomers ( Fig . 8 ) has four known effects of potential importance in vivo . First , it sup - presses spontaneous actin assembly by sterically hindering in - teractions between actin monomers required for the formation of polymerization intermediates ( 295 ) . Second , it restricts actin monomer addition to ﬁlament barbed ends , blocking addition to pointed ends ( 297 ) . Third , it can increase the rate of elon - gation at ﬁlament barbed ends capped by formins ( 195 , 321 ) . Fourth , it accelerates nucleotide exchange ( ATP for ADP ) on G - actin ( 242 ) . In biomimetic assays for cell motility that em - ploy puriﬁed proteins , proﬁlin becomes rate limiting for actin assembly , consistent with its proposed function in accelerating actin turnover ( 206 , 221 , 230 ) . However , it remains unclear which activities of proﬁlin are required in vivo . Synthetic lethal interactions between pfy1 - 4 and cof1 - 22 , srv2 (cid:4) , and act1 - 159 are consistent with proﬁlin promoting actin turnover in vivo . However , it is important to note that direct evidence for this proposed function is still lacking , as actin turnover rates have not been measured for proﬁlin mutants in vivo . One hypothesis is that proﬁlin’s ability to promote nucle - otide exchange on G - actin is critical for its proposed turnover function . This is supported by the observation that cellular defects caused by the pfy1 - 4 allele ( impaired in binding actin ) V OL . 70 , 2006 MECHANISM AND FUNCTION OF THE YEAST ACTIN CYTOSKELETON 635 on N o v e m be r 1 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / mm b r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m are suppressed by act1 - 157 , an allele with an increased intrinsic rate of nucleotide exchange ( 410 ) . This study concluded that proﬁlin has a critical role in vivo in accelerating actin monomer recycling . However , other observations suggest that proﬁlin may contribute to actin turnover by a mechanism other than promoting nucleotide exchange on G - actin . First , S . cerevisiae proﬁlin increases nucleotide exchange on G - actin by only (cid:3) 3 - fold in vitro , orders of magnitude less than human and birch pollen proﬁlin ( 88 ) . Second , there are no mutants yet available that impair nucleotide exchange without disrupting actin bind - ing . Thus , it is not possible to separate effects of proﬁlin on nucleotide exchange from its other effects , such as promotion of actin assembly by delivering monomers to the ends of Ena / VASP - or formin - capped ﬁlaments . Third , Arabidopsis proﬁlin , which binds to G - actin without promoting nucleotide exchange ( 290 ) , complements pfy1 (cid:4) yeast cells ( 62 ) ; this raises the pos - sibility that acceleration of nucleotide exchange may not be a critical function of proﬁlin in yeast . What turnover function might proﬁlin perform beyond ac - celerating nucleotide exchange on G - actin ? Recent studies ( see “Srv2 / CAP” above ) suggest that proﬁlin plays a key role along with Srv2 / CAP in facilitating the rapid conversion of actin monomers ( from a coﬁlin - bound ADP – G - actin state to an assembly - competent proﬁlin - bound ATP – G - actin state ) . In this proposed mechanism , proﬁlin binds to G - actin following nucleotide exchange . This is consistent with ( i ) proﬁlin having very low afﬁnity for ADP – G - actin and signiﬁcantly higher af - ﬁnity for ATP – G - actin ( 383 ) and ( ii ) proﬁlin failing to compete with coﬁlin for ADP – G - actin binding ( 23 ) . In cells , proﬁlin may ﬁrst bind to ATP - actin monomers while they are still associated with Srv2 / CAP , just after they have undergone nu - cleotide exchange ( see above ) . Srv2 / CAP has a weak afﬁnity for ATP – G - actin , which facilitates the handoff to proﬁlin ( 237 ) . In addition , since Srv2 - bound actin monomers cannot be added to ﬁlament barbed ends , an additional handoff is re - quired to factors such as proﬁlin that readily promote barbed end assembly . This model is supported by the ability of proﬁlin to siphon ATP - actin monomers from Srv2 / CAP and make them available for barbed end growth ( 237 ) . It is also sup - ported by physical interactions between proﬁlin and Srv2 / CAP that may facilitate monomer handoffs ( 32 , 82 ) . Thus , the loss of proﬁlin would stall this mechanism and rapidly deplete the assembly - competent pool of actin monomers . Another point to consider is that acceleration of nucleotide exchange by proﬁlin requires its interaction with actin but not proline - rich sequences , yet mutations in proﬁlin that impair polyproline binding ( without affecting actin binding ) cause se - vere defects in cell growth and actin organization ( 134 , 225 , 410 ) . This suggests that proﬁlin function in vivo depends on interactions with both actin and polyproline targets , indicating that proﬁlin must have critical functions beyond nucleotide exchange on actin . What is the other function of proﬁlin in vivo ? Proﬁlin targets actin monomers to the growing barbed ends of ﬁlaments associated with Ena / VASp and formins . In S . cerevisiae , which does not express Ena / VASP homologues , pro - ﬁlin is believed to target actin monomers to barbed ends of ﬁlaments that the formins Bni1 and Bnr1 assemble into cables and the actomyosin ring . Proﬁlin binding to the proline - rich formin FH1 domain is required for both Bni1 and Bnr1 to assemble ﬁlaments from proﬁlin - actin monomers in vitro ( 251 , 300 , 326 ) . Consistent with this function being important in vivo , proﬁlin mutants impaired in binding polyproline display severe defects in actin cable assembly and polarized cell growth ( 134 , 225 , 410 ) . Twinﬁlin . Twinﬁlin is a widely conserved 40 - kDa protein comprised of two tandem ADFH domains ( Fig . 13A ) . The founding member of the twinﬁlin family ( Twf1 ) was identiﬁed in S . cerevisiae by mining the genome database for coﬁlin ho - mologues and by isolation from crude extracts on F - actin af - ﬁnity columns with other actin - binding proteins , including cap - ping protein ( 125 ) . Initial biochemical characterization of Twf1 showed that it is an actin monomer - sequestering protein . Al - though twf1 (cid:4) mutants showed normal cell growth and mor - phology , their actin patches were slightly brighter , consistent with actin turnover defects , and recent work has demonstrated that loss of TWF1 reduces rates of actin patch turnover ( 252 ) . twf1 mutants also are synthetic lethal with cof1 and pfy1 mu - tants ( 125 ) , consistent with a role in promoting actin turnover . Biochemical analyses have left the precise role of Twf1 in actin turnover somewhat enigmatic . Twinﬁlin sequesters actin monomers ( 125 ) , with a strong binding preference for ADP – G - actin ( K d (cid:3) 0 . 05 (cid:2) M ) over ATP – G - actin ( K d (cid:3) 0 . 5 (cid:2) M ) ( 273 ) . While each ADFH domain of twinﬁlin is capable of binding G - actin , the C - terminal ADFH domain binds to G - actin with afﬁnity similar to that of intact twinﬁlin , suggesting that the N - terminal ADFH domain may have an alternative function . Twf1 also binds directly to capping protein ( Cap1 / Cap2 ) and requires capping protein for its localization to actin patches in vivo and for genetic functions shared with coﬁlin ( 101 , 285 ) . However , the Twf1 - capping protein interaction does not affect the capping activity of Cap1 / Cap2 or the mono - mer - sequestering activity of Twf1 . Thus , two discrepancies re - garding Twf1 function have been the following : how do Twf1 - actin interactions promote actin turnover in vivo , and what function is served by the Twf1 - capping protein interaction ? Two recent studies have shed new light on these issues . In one study , mammalian twinﬁlin was demonstrated to cap ﬁla - ment barbed ends ; however , this activity was not conserved in yeast Twf1 ( 143 ) . In a second study , yeast Twf1 was found to bind to and sever actin ﬁlaments at low pH ( 252 ) , an intriguing result given the known pH dependence of ADF / coﬁlin activi - ties on F - actin ( 24 , 85 , 162 ) . Further , capping protein directly inhibits the ﬁlament - severing activity of Twf1 ( 252 ) , represent - ing the ﬁrst biochemical function ascribed to this physiological interaction . Presently , it is difﬁcult to explain the in vivo sig - niﬁcance of the low - pH dependence of ﬁlament - severing ac - tivity in vitro . One possibility is that posttranslational modiﬁ - cations of Twf1 in vivo enable it to sever ﬁlaments at more neutral pH levels . Alternatively , Twf1 - severing activity may be regulated by pH ﬂuctuations in vivo . In summary , twinﬁlin function on actin turnover is likely to involve a balance among its interactions with G - actin and F - actin , with capping protein regulating the balance between these activities . Additionally , Twf1 binds to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , which inhibits its interactions with both G - actin ( 285 ) and F - actin ( 252 ) , suggesting that Twf1 function requires coordinated reg - ulation by multiple signals . 636 MOSELEY AND GOODE M ICROBIOL .

R EV . on N o v e m be r 1 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / mm b r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m CLOSING REMARKS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS Over the past decade , intense research efforts have shown that the three most prominent actin structures ( patches , cables , and rings ) are all highly dynamic , with patches and cables assembling and turning over in less than 60 seconds . Further , numerous genetic , two - hybrid , and biochemical studies have brought us close to having a complete list of actin - associated proteins involved in these processes . For many , their activities on actin have been determined ( Table 1 ) and their atomic structures now are available ( e . g . , Abp1 , the Arp2 / 3 complex , coﬁlin , coronin , proﬁlin , Sac6 , Srv2 / CAP , and twinﬁlin ) . All of this sets the stage for a detailed mechanistic dissection of the elegantly choreographed events in actin network assembly and function . One key future challenge is to develop new biochemical strategies for deﬁning the activities of actin - associated proteins in cellular mixtures . To date , the effects of actin - binding pro - teins on actin have been studied primarily using in vitro assays containing one or two puriﬁed actin - binding proteins and ac - tin , and often these components are not present at concentra - tions or molar ratios found in vivo . However , the activities of actin - binding proteins can be affected strongly by their in vivo binding partners ( e . g . , Crn1 - Arp2 / 3 , Aip1 - coﬁlin , and Srv2 / CAP - coﬁlin ) . Most actin - binding proteins do not function alone but rather in stable and / or dynamic complexes . Further , actin - binding proteins must compete for limited binding sites on actin , which can greatly inﬂuence their ability to affect actin dynamics and organization . Thus , the activities of actin - binding proteins should be examined in complex mixtures that more closely reﬂect physiological conditions . Some of these com - plexes can be isolated from yeast cells in native form ; others can be “built up” from puriﬁed proteins with known interac - tions . This also emphasizes the need to deﬁne local cellular concentrations and in vivo molar ratios of actin - binding pro - teins , as has been done recently for some actin - binding pro - teins in ﬁssion yeast ( 413 ) . A second future challenge is to understand how cellular signals regulate the activities of actin - binding proteins to alter actin ﬁlament assembly , organization , and turnover . Live cell imaging studies have revealed that the assembly and disassembly of yeast actin networks ( patches , cables , and rings ) are subject to exquisite spatial and temporal regulation . Further , many signaling molecules have been implicated in regulating actin cytoskeleton organization and function ( e . g . , Pkc1 , Ark1 / Prk1 , Ste20 / Cla4 , Cdc28 , and mi - togen - activated protein kinases ) . However , in the vast ma - jority of cases the actin - binding protein targets of these signaling pathways are unknown , and therefore the mecha - nisms of regulation are unclear . One of the few examples of direct regulation recently demonstrated is phospho - regula - tion of Pan1 NPF activity by Prk1 kinase ( 371 ) . Additionally , Rho GTPases directly regulate actin - binding proteins such as Bni1 and Bnr1 and control Ste20 / Cla4 kinases and the polarisome scaffold protein Bem1 ( 170 ) . More studies of this nature are needed , as these examples likely represent only the tip of the iceberg for signaling molecules governing the activities of actin - binding proteins .
