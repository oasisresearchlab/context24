Introduction Bone fracture is a major cause of severe physical disability and global socio - economic burden . 1 – 3 Over the past few decades , biomaterials and interface tissue engineering fields have made considerable progress in suggesting promising strategies to stimulate tissue regeneration after bone tissue damage and / or loss caused by trauma , pathol - ogy , and resorption . 4 – 6 Traditionally , titanium alloys ( known as bio - inert metallic implants ) are considered the gold standard for stabilizing bone fractures . 7 Compared to other implants such as stainless steel , titanium alloys are developed as promising bone implants due to their good Early osteoimmunomodulatory effects of magnesium – calcium – zinc alloys Maryam Rahmati 1 , Sabine Stötzel 2 , Thaqif El Khassawna 2 , 3 , Kamila Iskhahova 4 , DC Florian Wieland 4 , Berit Zeller Plumhoff 4 and Håvard Jostein Haugen 1 Abstract Today , substantial attention is given to biomaterial strategies for bone regeneration , and among them , there is a growing interest in using immunomodulatory biomaterials . The ability of a biomaterial to induce neo vascularization and macrophage polarization is a major factor in defining its success . Magnesium ( Mg ) - based degradable alloys have attracted significant attention for bone regeneration owing to their biodegradability and potential for avoiding secondary removal surgeries . However , there is insufficient evidence in the literature regarding the early inflammatory responses to these alloys in vivo . In this study , we investigated the early body responses to Mg - 0 . 45wt % Zn - 0 . 45wt % Ca pin - shaped alloy ( known as ZX00 alloy ) in rat femora 2 , 5 , and 10 days after implantation . We used 3D micro computed tomography ( µCT ) , histological , immunohistochemical , histomorphometrical , and small angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) analyses to study new bone formation , early macrophage polarization , neo vascularization , and bone quality at the implant bone interface . The expression of macrophage type 2 biological markers increased significantly after 10 days of Mg alloy implantation , indicating its potential in stimulating macrophage polarization . Our biomineralization results using µCT as well as histological stained sections did not indicate any statistically significant differences between different time points for both groups . The activity of alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) and Runt - related transcription factor 2 ( Runx 2 ) biological markers decreased significantly for Mg group , indicating less osteoblast activity . Generally , our results supported the potential of ZX00 alloy to enhance the expression of macrophage polarization in vivo ; however , we could not observe any statistically significant changes regarding biomineralization .

This phase can take from hours to several days . 20 After releasing biochemical cues , blood vessels expand and stimulate more blood flows into the injured area . In a normal wound healing process , the released type 1 macrophages polarize to type 2 mac - rophages , which mainly direct the expression of anti - inflammatory markers for about 2 weeks . During this phase , tissue granulation , fibroblast infiltration , neo - vas - cularization , and consequently wound healing occur . 18 , 20 After the biomaterial implantation , the time point of mac - rophage polarization from type 1 to 2 is affected by the injury caused by surgical operations , tissue type , and bio - material physicochemical properties . 17 , 20 The ability of a biomaterial to stimulate neo - vascularization and mac - rophage polarization defines its success . Reducing the host responses through modulating macrophage polarization has been the focus of many recent studies . 18 , 21 – 24 In addi - tion , the monocyte - macrophage cell lineage is known as a key player in bone regeneration and acute inflammatory response . This is largely owing to their high plasticity in response to environmental signals and their multiple roles in bone homeostasis . 25 Over the past few years , biomedical scientists and engi - neers have developed biodegradable metallic materials to improve the regenerative capability of biomaterials and stimulate the desirable immune system responses leading to the biomaterial’s success . 23 , 26 – 28 Such materials are developed to adjust their function in the body based on the biochemical and biomechanical properties of bone tis - sue . 29 A biodegradable biomaterial acts as a support for the surrounding cells / tissue to grow in , and therefore guides the healing processes toward new bone formation . 30 , 31 After repairing the damaged tissues , the implant is removed through in vivo degradation to non - toxic products , which reduces the need for a second surgical event to remove the implant . 13 – 15 Among different degradable materials , magnesium ( Mg ) implants have gained substantial attention as a supe - rior alternative material for bio - inert implants to induce less inflammatory responses and better bone formation . 21 , 23 , 32 , 33 Mg - based implants overcome the stress shielding issues of titanium - based and stainless steel implants and the low mechanical stability of polymers . 21 The density of Mg - based implants ( 1 . 7 – 2 . 0 g / cm 3 ) is closer to that of bone ( 1 . 8 – 2 . 1 g / cm 3 ) compared to titanium alloys ( 4 . 42 g / cm 3 for Ti - 6Al - 4V ) , stainless steels ( about 7 . 8 g / cm 3 ) , biodegrada - ble poly ( L - lactide ) ( about 1 g / cm 3 ) , and hydroxyapatite ( 3 . 156 g / cm 3 ) . In addition , the elastic modulus of Mg - based implants ( ~ 45 GPA ) is closer to that of bone compared to titanium alloys and stainless steels with a modulus of about 110 and 200 GPA , respectively . 34 – 36 Therefore , the stress shielding effect made by the high mismatch in elastic mod - ulus and density between the native bone and implants should be diminished after Mg implantation . 36 Mg is the second most abundant cellular cation and is a key player in regulating the immune system responses . 21 Over the last decade , many studies reported the favorable functional properties of Mg - based implants toward bone regenera - tion . 37 – 39 Zhang et al . 32 demonstrated that magnesium implants stimulate bone formation through increasing the expression of Calcitonin Gene - Related Peptide ( CGRP ) , as a neuropeptide released from the periosteum . 32 Reifenrath et al . 33 compared the osteoinductive properties and tissue responses of pure Mg with bio - inert titanium and degrada - ble glyconate implants in mice after 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , and 32 weeks of healing . 33 They observed less host body reactions in Mg compared to other groups over time . 33 In addition , Cheng et al . 40 demonstrated that Mg porous scaffolds could reduce the inflammatory responses as well as stimulate the expres - sion of collagen type 1 and osteopontin markers leading to enhanced bone formation after 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 , and 14 days in vitro cell culture and 8 weeks in vivo implantation . 40 The pro - inflammatory cytokines caused by magnesium ion’s deficiency could lead to osteoclastogenesis , 41 , 42 whereas the magnesium - induced anti - inflammatory cytokines and tissue repair factors benefit tissue healing . 43 , 44 The encapsu - lation of magnesium into titanium and calcium phosphate cement enhanced the macrophage type 2 polarization . 21 , 45 However , the fast degradation rate and hydrogen gas formation of Mg could potentially affect the host responses in vivo . More recent studies focus on overcoming these issues by modifying its physicochemical properties with surface coating and / or alloy development strategies . 46 , 47 Biodegradable alloys made of Mg , zinc ( Zn ) , and calcium ( Ca ) , known as Mg - Zn - Ca ternary or ZX alloys , are among the most recent developed Mg - based alloys that have gained attention in the field . 7 , 48 – 51 Theoretically , due to the presence of all three elements in the body , the organism could metabolize the implanted alloy safely . 52 Cipriano et al . 53 studied the influence of degradation products over time on bone cell functions and reported that the ZX alloys can increase the cell functions toward new bone forma - tion . 30 However , as above - mentioned , immune cells , espe - cially macrophages also play key roles in directing the host Rahmati et al . 3 responses to biomaterials and we should study their responses to ZX alloys . To address this point , Costantino et al . 23 studied the in vitro effects of Mg - based alloys and their degradation products on macrophage polarization , and observed that the alloys could stimulate the expression of both pro - and anti - inflammatory factors . Although it is undeniable that the biomaterial’s behavior in the body could be different to the in vitro conditions , in vivo studies on the early inflammatory and bone tissue responses to Mg - based alloys are still lacking in the literature . Hence , this study aimed to examine the early blood ves - sel , macrophages , and bone cell responses 2 , 5 , and 10 days , after implantation . Therefore , 12 ZX00 pin - shaped implants ( Mg - 0 . 45wt % Zn - 0 . 45wt % Ca ) were inserted in the meta - physis of 12 rat femurs . Nonetheless , to examine the heal - ing process without initial defect gap filling with implants , an empty defect group was examined as a control group . However , a direct compression of tissue properties between the two defect types with and without materials is impos - sible . Therefore , the groups were examined without statisti - cal correlation . Whereas , the healing progression between the time points was compared in all groups with and with - out materials . Our null hypothesis was that the Mg - based implant could stimulate macrophage polarization and oste - ogenesis in vivo . Different 2 and 3D imaging technologies have been recently developed to study the bone - biomaterial interface in the body . 54 – 57 In this study , we used different histology , immunohistochemistry , histomorphometry , 3D micro computed tomography ( µCT ) , and small - angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) analyses to evaluate the tissue responses to the Mg alloys . We hypothesized that the results obtained from both 2 and 3D imaging technologies would be comparable . Materials and methods Materials development The purified Mg was alloyed with zinc and calcium to syn - thesize the Mg - 0 . 45wt % Zn - 0 . 45wt % Ca pin - shaped alloy with a diameter of 1 . 6 mm and length of 8 mm ( known as ZX00 alloy ) . Readers could find the details of alloy devel - opment by Grün et al . 50 Animal surgery The animal experiments were performed at the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology , Medical University of Graz . All animal experiments were done under the animal ethical respect , complied with the ARRIVE guidelines , and were authorized by the Austrian Ministry of Science and Research ( accreditation number BMBWF - 66 . 010 / 0066 - V / 3b / 2019 ) . We purchased 4 - week - old female Sprague - Dawley ® ( SD ) rats ( n = 12 ) from Janvier Laboratories ( Saint Berthevin , France ) , and kept them on normal feed during the study . Rats were housed in groups of four in clear plastic cages on standard bedding . Water and a stand - ard pellet diet were given ad libitum . At 6 weeks of age , the animals were divided into three groups to study the host responses 2 , 5 , and 10 days after implantation . Mg pin - shaped alloys ( Mg - 0 . 45wt % Zn - 0 . 45wt % Ca ) with a diam - eter of 1 . 6 mm were transcortically implanted into the right femur . A defect was created in the left leg , thereby serving as the sham control ( the diameter of the drill hole was 1 . 6 mm ) . Readers could find the details of surgical and post - operative procedures in the Kraus et al . 58 paper . Generally , after the specified time points , the explanted bone tissues were dissected from soft tissues , fixed in phos - phate - buffered 4 % paraformaldehyde , and kept at 4°C for 2 days . 3D micro - CT ( µCT ) analysis Samples were scanned with a commercially available desktop µCT scanner ( Skyscan 1172 , Bruker micro - CT , Kontich , Belgium ) . This system ( Skyscan 1172 ) contains an X - ray µfocus tube of 5 μ m spot size with a high - voltage power supply , a specimen stage with a precision manipula - tor , and a two - dimensional X - ray charge - coupled device ( CCD ) camera . The CCD camera was set with an isotropic voxel resolution of 4 . 98 μ m for all the samples . The bone samples were wrapped in Parafilm ® ( American National Can™ , Chicago IL , USA ) , and placed on a brass stub with Playdough . Scans were obtained at 70 kV and 129 μ A using a 0 . 5 mm thick aluminum filter to optimize the con - trast , a 360° rotation , three - frames averaging , a rotation step of 0 . 4° , and an exposure time of 560 ms . After recon - struction ( NRecon ® ) , the imaging analysis ( CTan ) of bone formation was done for both groups . We defined an 80 µm ring around implants ( as the bone - implant interface ) and a 1 . 6 mm circle ( equal to the defect size ) for the sham group . The 3D images were generated in CTVOx ( Bruker micro - CT , Kontich , Belgium ) . Regarding the Mg group , we chose the 80 µm ring as the interface as this size would be enough to study the bone metabolism . In addition , when we chose bigger regions , we could reach the cortical bone in some animals ( because of the anatomical differences between different animals ) , which could provide us some false positive results by analyzing the old bone tissue in the cortical area . Histological , enzyme histochemical , and immunohistochemical analyses After µCT imaging , we embedded the fixed samples in Technovit ® 9100 new according to the manufacturer’s pro - tocol ( Heraeus Kulzer , Hanau , Germany ) . 59 The samples were sectioned in 5 µm thickness onto Kawamoto’s film ( SECTION - LAB Co . Ltd . , Hiroshima , Japan ) using a motorized rotary microtome ( Thermo / Microm HM 355 S , 4 Journal of Tissue Engineering Thermo Scientific GmbH , Karlsruhe , Germany ) . Movat Pentachrome and Von Kossa / Van Gieson stains were used to evaluate the bone mineralization / non - mineralization balance over time . Movat Pentachrome stain was used to image different constituents of the connective tissue . The stain colors the tis - sues so that mineralized bone appears bright yellow , mineral - ized cartilage appears as blue - green , and non - mineralized bone , elastic fibers , and muscles appear bright red . 60 Von Kossa / Van Gieson staining was used to distinguish the min - eralized bone matrix from the newly formed bone matrix . The stain indicates mineralized bone matrix in black and newly formed bone matrix in pink to red color . 61 To study the osteoblast and osteoclast balance , we used alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP ) enzyme histochemistry as known biological markers for osteoblast and osteoclast activities , respectively . Briefly , sections were deplastified , for TRAP treated with Sodium Acetate buffer and incubated in Napthol - AS - TR phosphate ( N6125 - 1G , Sigma , Germany ) and Sodium Tartrate ( Merck , Germany ) at 37°C for 60 min . For ALP stained sections , samples were treated with Tris and then incubated in BCIP / NBT phosphate substrate at 37°C for 60 min . 62 , 63 Collagen fibers properties ( such as width , length , straightness , and angle ) were evaluated using Sirius Red . The imaging was done using a polarized filter . Immunohistochemistry was performed using primary antibodies ( Abcam Company , Cambridge , UK ) . The follow - ing antibodies were used : rabbit monoclonal [ EPR5368 ] to alpha smooth muscle Actin ( α - SMA ) , rabbit monoclonal [ EPR24039 - 262 ] to factor VIII , rabbit polyclonal to CD68 ( ab125212 ) , rabbit polyclonal to CD80 ( ab64116 ) , rabbit polyclonal to Mannose Receptor , also known as CD206 , ( ab64693 ) , rabbit monoclonal [ EPR14335 - 78 ] to SRY - Box transcription factor 9 ( Sox 9 ) , rabbit monoclonal [ EPR14334 ] to runt - related transcription factor 2 ( Runx 2 ) . Readers can find the details of immunohistochemistry protocol and mate - rials elsewhere . 63 , 64 To study the blood vessel formation and neo - vasculari - zation , α - SMA and factor VIII primary antibodies were diluted in DAKO - Diluent ( S 0809 ) , 1 : 2000 and 1 : 1000 , respectively . Regarding the macrophage polarization study , CD68 , 80 , and 206 were diluted in DAKO - Diluent , 1 : 200 , 1 : 300 , and 1 : 500 , respectively . For type 1 mac - rophages , we used CD68 and CD80 as the marker set as well as CD68 and CD206 for type 2 macrophages . 63 Furthermore , Sox 9 and Runx 2 were diluted in DAKO - Diluent ( 1 : 500 ) to study the bone metabolism . We chose Movat Pentachrome and α - SMA stained sec - tions to study the general tissue formation descriptively . In the Movat Pentachrome stained sections , we studied the tissue homogeneity and integrity as well as defect closure in both groups using a 3 - point scale system ( poor , fair , good for 1 – 3 , respectively ) . Additionally , α - SMA stained sections were used to study the blood vessel phenotype and regularity over time using a 3 - point scale system . We defined the round shape vessels as regular type 1 , small to moderate oval shape ones as regular type 2 and big vessels in oval or other undefined shapes as irregular type 3 vessels . Quantitative histomorphometrical analysis Imaging was done using a Leica microscopy system ( Leica DM5500 photomicroscope equipped with a DFC7000 camera and operated by LASX software version 3 . 0 , Leica Microsystem Ltd , Wetzlar , Germany ) . All stained sections ( except from TRAP and Sirius Red ) were imaged at 20 × ( 3 . 09 pixel / μ m ) magnification . TRAP and Sirius Red stained sections were imaged at 40 × ( 6 . 17 pixel / μ m ) magnification . The histomorphometry measurements of Sirius Red stained sections were done using CT - FIRE ( Curvelet Transform and Fiber Extraction Algorithm ) software developed in Matlab ( The Mathworks Inc . ) . This software automatically allows extracting collagen fibers in an image and quantifies the fiber properties with descriptive statis - tics ( such as fiber angle , length , straightness , and width ) . 65 Fiji ImageJ was used for histomorphometry measure - ments of other stained sections . Fiji ImageJ ( version 1 . 51r ; NIH , Maryland , USA ) was used as a platform to run the program . The Trainable Weka Segmentation ( TWS ) was used as the base to create an optimized script to analyze tissue formation parameters such as mineralization , new bone and cartilage formation , vascularization and mac - rophage polarization . The histomorphometry measure - ments were done following Malhan et al . 66 paper . Small angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) analysis Technovit embedded bone sections with 70 µm thickness were provided to study the collagen / hydroxyapatite ( HAp ) orientation and the size of hydroxyapatite plates using SAXS analysis . Sections were measured at a SAXS lab source , Nanostar , Bruker , Germany . The used wavelength was 1 . 54 Å , and the sample to detector distance was 1 . 083 m . The calibration of the instrument was done using silver behenate . For azimuthal integration pyFAI was used . Sections were raster - scanned with a beam of 60 µm diam - eter . The step size in the 2D scan was adjusted accordingly to 60 µm . The scanned regions were chosen based on microscope images , and the region size was also adapted to the section based on the histological and µCT images . The analysis of HAp orientation and the size of hydroxyapatite plates was done using a Matlab script developed in - house . The orientation of the platelets was evaluated based on the anisotropic scattering signal . To determine the size and degree of orientation , the stack and card model developed by Gourrier et al . 67 was used . Rahmati et al . 5 In the scattering data , no direct signal from collagen could be seen . However , anisotropic scattering originating from HAp could be identified . As HAp normally aligned with the collagen matrix in which they are mineralized , it is a reasonable assumption that the collagen matrix orien - tation can be deduced from the HAp orientation . Statistical analysis A Kolmogorov – Smirnov test was done to check the para - metric or nonparametric distributions of the dataset . Then , a normality test was done ( Holm - Sidak method ) . When the data were distributed normally , the data were presented as arithmetic mean values with standard deviation ; and as median values with interquartile range when the data were not normally distributed . One - way ANOVA on ranks was performed when the normality test failed , using the Kruskal – Wallis test for post hoc comparison . Otherwise , regular ANOVA was performed with a Tukey test for post hoc com - parison . All analysis were performed in GraphPad Prism 8 ( GraphPad Software Company , San Diego , California , USA ) . Significant and highly significant differences were presented as * p < 0 . 05 and * * p < 0 . 01 , respectively . Results Macrophage polarization The bone healing process has three main phases including inflammatory , reparative , and remodeling phases , which partially overlap with each other . Bone injuries disrupt bone matrix , blood vessels , and the surrounding soft tis - sues , which consequences in bleeding into the defect gap . Bleeding forms the initial hematoma , which causes the hypoxic state around the defect gap . 68 – 70 Hematoma is fol - lowed and accompanied by inflammation , which is started by the expression of various cytokines , growth factors , and extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins . The expression of these inflammatory markers stimulates , recruits , and sup - ports the proliferation of essential cells for bone forma - tion . 68 – 70 For instance , Interleukin - 1 ( IL - 1 ) and IL - 6 , which are secreted by macrophages and T cells , respectively , both stimulate proliferation and differentiation of MSCs into chondrocytes and osteoblasts after injuries . 71 Hence , we first studied the vascularization and macrophage polar - ization after implantation . It should be noted that in this study , because of the dif - ferent regions of interests of sham ( defect site , 1 . 6 mm ) and Mg groups ( 80 µm at the interface area ) , we did not directly compare the two groups to each other . We studied the tissue healing of both groups individually and com - pared the responses over time . We studied the macrophage polarization in both groups by focusing on the distribution of macrophage type 1 – 2 subsets over time ( Figures 1 ( a ) and S1 - A ) . We used CD68 and CD80 subsets as the biological markers of type 1 macrophages , as well as CD68 and CD206 subsets for type 2 macrophages . 41 During the first 5 and 10 days , macrophage phenotype changed in both groups from predominantly macrophages type 1 – 2 with significant changes for Mg group ( Figure 1 ( a ) – ( d ) ) . We observed a significantly higher number of CD206 - positive macrophages ( type 2 macrophages ) for Mg group in comparison to sham over time . Type 2 mac - rophages were present 2 and 5 days after the surgery , and they dominated at the interface 10 days after surgery , while the percentage of type 1 macrophages was decreased sig - nificantly . Although the same pattern was seen in the sham group , the changes in type 2 macrophages were not signifi - cant indicating improved immunomodulatory effects of Mg alloy toward tissue healing . Vascularization We considered factor VIII and α - SMA positive blood ves - sel formation to study the neo - vascularization and blood vessel formation in both groups over time ( Figure 2 ) . The bright field and fluorescent representative mages of α - SMA positive blood vessels in both groups are shown in Figures 2 ( a ) and S1 - B , respectively . Regarding the sham group , the number of positive blood vessels decreased for both factor VIII and α - SMA positive blood vessels over time ; however , the changes were not significant ( Figure 2 ( b ) and ( c ) ) . However , the regularity of α - SMA positive blood vessels increased over time , suggesting a normal tis - sue healing ( Figure 2 ( d ) – ( f ) ) . Although we found no sig - nificant differences for the sham group over time , the largest data variance was seen on day 5 . The percentage of factor VIII positive blood vessels ( for neo - vascularization ) decreased significantly for Mg group at day 5 ( p < 0 . 05 ) and increased at day 10 . However , the α - SMA positive blood vessels had an opposite pattern at day 5 , with an increase in the number of positive vessels , regardless of their regularity type ( Figure 2 ( b ) – ( f ) ) . Bone mineralization We studied the mineralized versus non - mineralized bone formation over time , using both 3D µCT and 2D histology and compared data afterward ( Figures 3 ( a ) , ( b ) , and S2 ) . We observed no significant differences over time for both groups regarding the percentage of bone volume to tissue volume ( BV / TV ) and bone surface to bone volume ( BS / BV ) . In terms of mineralization , the 2D histology data from Von Kossa / Van Gieson staining confirmed the µCT data indicating no significant differences over time for both groups . The non - mineralization ( newly bone matrix forma - tion ) decreased after 5 days and then increased after 10 days in both groups ; however , the changes were not statistically significant . The sudden changes in the bone matrix forma - tion of both groups at day 5 were in accordance with the 6 Journal of Tissue Engineering sudden changes of vascularization and macrophage polari - zation data . We further studied the bone formation changes over time using Movat Pentachrome staining and analyzed the changes both quantitatively and descriptively ( Figure 4 ) . The descriptive data showed that in the majority of sham samples , the tissue homogeneity was in the bad to fair categories ( 1 and 2 ) , regardless of time point , while in the fair to good categories ( 2 and 3 ) for Mg - based alloys . The tissue integrity and defect closure of all sham samples and the majority of Mg - based alloys were in the fair to good categories ( 2 and 3 ) . These data supported the ZX00 alloy stimulatory potential toward normal bone healing . Figure 1 . Immunohistochemical analysis of macrophage polarization over time . ( a ) Representative images of antibody staining against CD68 , 80 , and 206 macrophage markers ( red color ) 10 days after implantation in the Mg - based alloy and sham groups , scale bar = 200 µm . CD68 , 80 were used as the markers of macrophage type 1 , while CD80 and CD206 were the markers for macrophage type 2 . Quantitative histomorphometrical data of macrophage polarization using the percentage of antibodies against CD68 ( b ) , CD80 ( c ) , and CD206 ( d ) markers over time . The percentage of CD80 decreased significantly after 10 days in both groups ( p < 0 . 05 ) . However , the percentage of CD206 marker significantly increased only in Mg group after 10 days , compared with day 2 and 5 ( p < 0 . 05 ) . After 5 and 10 days , macrophage phenotype changed in both groups from predominantly macrophages type 1 – 2 with significant changes for Mg group ( b – d ) . We observed a significantly higher number of CD206 positive macrophages ( type 2 macrophages ) for Mg group compared with sham over time . Values represent the mean ± standard deviation . Significant differences were presented as * p < 0 . 05 . Rahmati et al . 7 Figure 2 .

An insignificant decrease in the percentage of positive blood vessels was observed for both factor VIII and α - SMA positive blood vessels over time in sham group .

The round shape vessels were categorized as regular type 1 vessels , black arrow ( d , e ) , small to moderate oval shape ones as regular type 2 , blue arrow , ( d , f ) and big vessels in oval or other undefined shapes as irregular type 3 vessels , green arrow ( e , g ) . Values represent the mean ± standard deviation . Significant differences were presented as * p < 0 . 05 . 8 Journal of Tissue Engineering Regarding bone mineralization , the quantitative data from this staining confirmed the previous results obtained by µCT and Von Kossa / Van Gieson staining . In addition , cartilage distribution decreased significantly for sham group after 5 days with p value of 0 . 0350 . The cartilage formation is a key part of the bone healing reparative phase . This phase is mainly addressed by the development of new blood ves - sels and cartilage formation . The neighboring soft tissue stimulates vascular ingrowth firstly to the periosteal area and then to the endosteal layers of tissue ( Figure 4 ) . 72 , 73 In the normal conditions , the cortical blood supply is mainly from endosteal bone and branches out in a radial manner from the center of the medullary canal . However , during the reparative phase , most of the cortex blood supply comes from outside the tissue than inside of it . Inflammatory medi - ators in the fracture hematoma activate chondrocytes to Figure 3 . Analyzing the bone mineralization in Mg - based alloy and sham groups over time .

There was no significant differences between groups regarding their tissue homogeneity , integrity , and defect closure . Although the percentage of mineralized and non - mineralized bone tissue did not significantly change over time for both groups , cartilage formation significantly decreased after 5 days for sham group ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Values represent the mean ± standard deviation . Significant differences were presented as * p < 0 . 05 . 10 Journal of Tissue Engineering form the fracture callus . Hematoma is ultimately substituted by the ingrowth of fibrovascular tissue . This developing construct supports the stabilization of bone ends . At this stage , proteins secreted by osteoblasts and chondroblasts consolidate into a new bone substance named as a soft cal - lus , which eventually strengthens into a hard callus as the bone forms its final texture . The two types of bone forma - tion known as intramembranous and endochondral bone formation can occur during the first 10 days of injuries . 72 , 73 The endochondral bone formation takes place in the absence of rigid fixation . 72 , 73 Differentiation of progenitor cells into chondrocytes following by the secretion of biological fac - tors leads to producing a cartilaginous matrix , including col - lagen II . This soft callus spans the fracture gap . 68 , 74 , 75 Later chondrocytes undergo hypertrophy , and chondrocyte - medi - ated mineralization , in a process similar to the one that occurs during the development of growth plate . 76 When vas - culature starts to invade , the hypertrophic chondrocytes are removed and woven bone formation occurs after the recruit - ment of osteo - progenitor cells . 77 Bone metabolism and Mg retention We further studied the bone healing process in both groups by focusing on the balanced osteoblast / osteoclast activities as well as the balanced anabolic and catabolic responses after implantation ( Figure 5 ) . During the last phase of bone healing process , known as remodeling , the newly woven bone is converted into the lamellar bone . First , osteoclasts begin absorbing a cavity known as the cutting cone . Osteoblasts migrate to this cone and form a bone matrix layer in opposition to the existing surface , which ulti - mately leads to regenerate the original structure and bio - mechanical competence of the injured sites . 78 , 79 Therefore , here we focused on evaluating the osteoblast / osteoclast activities . We observed a significant decrease in the osteo - blast activity using ALP enzyme histochemistry after 5 and 10 days in sham group compared to day 2 , with p values of 0 . 0189 and 0 . 0271 , respectively . In the Mg group , there were no significant differences between the ALP activity of defined time points ( with p values of 0 . 6416 , 0 . 0908 , and 0 . 4355 for 2 vs 5 , 2 vs 10 , and 2 vs 10 days , respec - tively ) ( Figure 5 ( a ) and ( c ) ) . We also used TRAP enzyme histochemistry to study the osteoclast activity . Although some research groups observed the osteoclast activity after 1 week in vitro and / or in vivo using TRAP staining , 80 , 81 we did not see any osteo - clasts in the defined region of interests of both groups ( data not shown ) . The Mg retention over time was done by com - paring the Mg diameter before ( 1 . 6 mm ) and after implanta - tion ( Figure 5 ( b ) ) , we utilized the same histological sections that were used for the ALP staining . The integrity of Mg - based alloy structure was favorable in those sections than the TRAP stained ones . The data showed a significant Mg retention 5 and 10 days after the implantation compared to day 2 . However , the differences between 5 and 10 days after implantation were insignificant . To study the bone metabolism activities after implanta - tion in more detail , we evaluated the percentage of Sox 9 and Runx 2 as the key players in determining the chondro - cyte and osteoblast cell fate , respectively ( Figure 5 ( d ) ) . 82 Regarding Sox 9 , the changes were not statistically signifi - cant and only a slight decrease was seen over time for both groups ( Figure 5 ( e ) ) . However , the total percentage of chondrogenesis in Mg group was higher than that of sham group . The percentage of Runx 2 biological marker for osteoblast activity did not significantly change over time for sham group ( Figure 5 ( f ) ) ; however , it significantly decreased for Mg group at day 5 ( p value = 0 . 0094 ) . The Runx 2 percentage increased slightly at day 10 , which could be a sign for initiating the bone formation mecha - nisms after 10 days compared to day 5 . Collagen / hydroxyapatite ( HAp ) orientation The collagen architecture is a key player in determining the function and mechanical behavior of bone tissue . To engineer a functional and load - bearing bone tissue that meets the body’s mechanical demands , we require a detailed understanding of the collagen orientation and properties after implantation compared to the normal heal - ing conditions after a fracture . Using Sirius Red staining , we also studied the collagen fiber properties in both groups over time ( Figure 6 ( a ) ) . The collagen fiber length , width , and straightness ( Figure 6 ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( e ) ) remained approximately unchanged over time for the sham group . However , regarding the Mg - based alloy group , we observed increasing the fiber length as well as decreasing the fiber width , angle , and straightness toward 90° orienta - tion ( Figure 6 ( b ) – ( e ) ) . Although histological and immunohistochemical anal - yses are considered the gold standard experiments to study the biomaterial - tissue interface , it would be beneficial to use other imaging systems to study their potential in evalu - ating the interface . Therefore , besides histological , enzyme histochemical , immunohistochemical and histomorpho - metrical analyses , we evaluated the new bone formation at the interface using 3D micro computed tomography ( µCT ) and small - angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) analyses . Using SAXS , we analyzed the collagen / hydroxyapatite ( HAp ) orientation and the size of hydroxyapatite plates ( T - parameter ) to study the effects of Mg - base alloy on the quality of formed bone at early time points compared to the sham group ( Figures 7 and 8 ) . Figure 7 shows the scat - tered intensity as well as HAp orientation and size of the sham group over time . The cortical region of bone had an orientation along the defect axis 2 and 5 days after surgery ( Figure 7 ( a ) and ( f ) ) . In the medulla ( where the defect site was located ) , a mineralized region was presented 2 days after surgery ; however , it was much larger than the original Rahmati et al . 11 defect size ( Figure 7 ( a ) and ( b ) ) . We could also observe the mineralized regions in the cortical bone region 5 days after surgery ( Figure 7 ( d ) and ( e ) ) . Although the HAp / collagen matrix was in the orientation along the bone axis , we could not observe any residuals of the defect at day 10 ( Figure 7 ( g ) and ( h ) ) . The size of HAp was roughly 2 nm for all time points ( Figure 7 ( c ) , ( f ) , and ( i ) ) . Figure 8 shows the scattered intensity as well as HAp orientation and size of the Mg - based alloy group over time . The implant location was visible in all samples . Figure 8 ( a ) shows a high - intensity scattering ring around the implant , which is mostly originating from the implant located in the sections . The most orientated regions were located at the cortical bone of sample in the direction of the bone axis . Although we observed less orientation of the HAp crystals around implants , a highly mineralized region could be seen as a scattering signal at the inter - face ( Figure 8 ( a ) – ( c ) ) . We observed only a minor degree of HAp orientation at the interface on day 5 ( Figure 8 ( d ) – ( f ) ) . However , the HAp platelets size increased at the interface . The bone orientation at day 5 was in the horizontal direction compared to the other time points , Figure 5 .

Significant and highly significant differences were presented as * p < 0 . 05 and * * p < 0 . 01 , respectively . 12 Journal of Tissue Engineering Figure 6 .

A significant decrease in the collagen straightness for Mg group was observed after 5 days ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Values represent the mean ± standard deviation . Significant differences were presented as * p < 0 . 05 . Rahmati et al . 13 where the bone was always orientated vertically . This could be a reason for the previously observed histologi - cal changes after 5 days in Mg group . The scattering dis - tribution in Figure 8 ( g ) directly shows the implant position 10 days after implantation . The scattering data showed a mineralized bone layer of roughly 120 µm at the interface . Even though we observed a strong scatter - ing signal at the interface , a minor degree of orientation was seen . We detected the strongest orientation of HAp and collagen in the cortical bone showing an orientation parallel to the bone axis on day 10 . Overall , the size of HAp crystals along the cortical bone was roughly 2 nm . We observed an increased HAp thick - ness ( 3 . 5 – 4 nm ) at the bone - implant interface , indicating better bone remodeling . These results were in accordance with the data obtained from Sirius Red staining indicating better collagen fiber orientation and bone quality in Mg group compared to sham . Discussion Mg degradation and gas formation Owing to their biodegradability , Mg - based implants have gained substantial attention in the medicine world as a replacement for permanent bio - inert metallic implants . 46 , 52 , 83 Mg degrades through a corrosion process initiating from its standard electrode potential of −2 . 372 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode . It corrodes in aqueous solutions by forming magnesium hydroxide ( Mg ( OH ) 2 ) and hydrogen gas ( H 2 ) . 84 The corrosion products ( mainly Mg 2 + ions ) interact with chloride ions in the body fluid or are digested by macrophages . 49 However , during the early stages of Mg implantation , it corrodes quicker , causing an implant mechanical instability . This occurs owing to the lack of MgO + Mg ( OH ) 2 protective layer on the fresh surface . 85 Recently , Grün et al . 50 developed the ZX00 alloy , as a new Mg - based alloy to avoid the rapid corrosion of Mg . 50 They Figure 7 .

Samples are scanned in a region of approximately 5 mm by 5 mm and each pixel corresponds to a probed region of 60 µm in radius . The shown information are a result of evaluating the scattering data and , therefore , test specific features at other length scales . Representative images of descriptively analyzing the scattered intensity ( a , d , g ) as well as the HAp orientation in degree ( b , e , h ) and size of the platelets in nm ( c , f , i ) . No residuals of the defect were detected after day 10 for sham group ( g , h ) . The HAp size was homogenous along the bone and around 2 nm for all time points ( c , f , i ) . The color code in the HAp orientation analysis ( b , e , h ) shows the orientation degree , which corresponds to the inset , for example , red is along the y - axis of the image . 14 Journal of Tissue Engineering studied the long - term bone tissue responses to the alloy in both growing - rat and sheep models to investigate its poten - tial for improving pediatric bone healing . Their results indi - cated a slow and homogeneous alloy degradation with an average degradation rate of 0 . 08 and 0 . 045 mm / year in rat and sheep animal models , respectively . 50 In this study , we calculated the Mg degradation rate by comparing the diam - eter of the XZ00 alloys in the histological sections with the initial diameter of alloys before implantation . We observed a significantly fast Mg surface retention by measuring the diameter of pins after implantation within the first 5 days of our study . The same growing - rat animal model indicated the possible influence of biochemical interactions between the Zn , Ca , and Mg ions with the bodily fluids . However , the degradation rate remained stable between 5 and 10 days of implantation . Previously , Walker et al . 86 Studied the degradation rate of pure Mg and five alloys ( AZ31 , Mg - 0 . 8Ca , Mg - 1Zn , Mg - 1Mn , Mg - 1 . 34Ca - 3Zn ) in vitro and in vivo in the sub - cutaneous environment of rats after 7 , 14 , and 21 days of implantation . 86 They observed that the degradation rate of pure Mg , AZ31 , and Mg - 1Zn remained stable or slightly decreased between 7 and 14 days ; however , Mg - 0 . 8Ca , Mg - 1Mn , and Mg - 1 . 34Ca - 3Zn degraded faster within the same time point . 86 In addition , Fischerauer et al . 87 studied the effects of micro - arc oxidation ( MAO ) surface treat - ment on the degradation rates of Mg - 5Zn - 0 . 3Ca alloy ( ZX50 ) and in a rat animal model . 87 Although using in vivo µCT , the corrosion layer could be observed on the ZX50 surface , the MAO - coated alloys are stable and do not show any sign of degradation after 7 days of implanta - tion . 87 In another study , Nidadavolu et al . 88 reported that Figure 8 . Studying the collagen / hydroxyapatite ( HAp ) orientation and the size of hydroxyapatite platelets in the Mg - based alloy group over time using small angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) analysis . Samples are scanned in a region of approximately 5 mm by 5 mm and each pixel corresponds to a probed region of 60 µm in radius . The shown information are a result of evaluating the scattering data and , therefore , test specific features at other length scales . Representative images of descriptively analyzing the scattered intensity ( a , d , g ) as well as the HAp orientation in degree ( b , e , h ) and size of the platelets in nm ( c , f , i ) . Only a minor degree of HAp orientation was observed at the Mg interface after 5 days ( d – f ) . However , the HAp platelets size increased at the interface . The bone orientation at day 5 was in the horizontal direction ; however bone was always orientated vertically at other time points . The color code in the HAp orientation analysis ( a , d , g ) shows the orientation degree , which corresponds to the inset , for example , red is along the y - axis of the image . Rahmati et al . 15 although the degradation rate of Mg - 0 . 3Ca is fast within the first 24 h of immersion in DMEM Glutamax + 10 % FBS ( Fetal Bovine Serum ) + 1 % Penicillin streptomycin cell culture solution , it reaches a stable rate of 0 . 51 µm / day after 5 days . 88 Studying the degradation rate of Mg alloys is still a challenging issue as it could be different depend - ing on the in vitro and in vivo experimental conditions , the time the alloy is kept in formalin after harvesting the tis - sue , the Mg alloy composition , concentration of each ele - ment , and the used technique for evaluation . 89 Within the studied time points , we did not observe any sign of H 2 gas formation around the implant . However , this could not certainly mean that this alloy does not form any H 2 gas . Grün et al . 50 studied the gas formation of this alloy between 2 and 24 weeks in the same animal model and reported a moderate gas evolution 4 and 6 months after implantation . 50 The alloy degradation rate and gas evolu - tion should be further studied by considering longer time points and using in vivo µCT imaging to obtain detailed information . Inflammatory responses and vascularization Because macrophages and other inflammatory immune cells play key roles in determining the biomaterial’s suc - cess after implantation , biomaterials with immunomodula - tory potential have gained much attention over the past few years . 90 – 92 Qiao et al . 25 Have more recently demon - strated that the influx of magnesium through the transient receptor potential cation channel member 7 ( TRPM7 ) channel and the nuclear translocation of TRPM7 - cleaved kinase fragments ( M7CKs ) lead to the polarization of mac - rophages into a pro - osteogenic subtype . 25 This further stimulates the osteogenic differentiation of MSC , which is distinct from the classical macrophage type 1 / 2 pheno - types . Their data supported that the initial immune response to bone injuries , regulated by cell types in the monocyte - macrophage - preosteoclast lineage , could be controlled to enhance tissue regeneration through different signals such as magnesium ion signaling pathways . However , the osteo - promoting functions of magnesium only is affective during the early phase of osteogenesis as the continued stimulation of magnesium over activates the nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells ( NF - κ B ) signaling pathway and prevents mineraliza - tion of extracellular matrix . 25 Our results supported their findings indicating that ZX00 alloy could potentially mod - ulate the early inflammatory responses after implantation toward tissue healing . We found that the alloy could sig - nificantly regulate the polarization of macrophages toward higher expression of type 2 macrophages , 5 and 10 days after implantation , which could stimulate tissue healing and reduce the immune responses against the alloy degra - dation products . We also observed significantly improved immune system responses to ZX00 alloy compared to sham , which supported our null hypothesis . This could be because of the early surface degradation of alloy and con - sequently the release of ions ( Mg , Zn , and Ca ions ) from the alloy surface and their potential interactions with intra - cellular ionic channels . 7 , 53 This was in agreement with results from Li et al . 21 study on macrophage responses to the Mg - coated titanium implants compared to pure tita - nium implants . 21 They observed a significantly higher number of type 2 macrophages in the Mg - coated group 4 and 7 days post implantation . 21 Mg is a Ca antagonist and can interfere with the Ca signaling pathways . 23 , 93 It can control inflammation through activating phagocytic cells and their effector functions , intercellular Ca channels , N - methyl - d - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors , and nuclear fac - tor - kappa B ( NF κ B ) . 94 After the implantation of a biocompatible implant , native blood vessels disrupt causing interactions between blood and implant . 18 After the macrophage polarization from type 1 to 2 , macrophages locally release several growth factors ( e . g . vascular endothelial growth factor ) and induce fibro - blast and endothelial cell migration as well as proliferation by sending biochemical signals . The migrated endothelial cells promote the formation of new blood vessels toward neo - tissue formation . 95 Our results indicated a slight increase in the percentage of blood vessels after 5 days in the ZX00 alloy group . Because neo - vascularization is a key player in stimulating bone healing . 21 New bone formation In this study , we focused on the early osteogenic responses to ZX00 alloy by studying the mineralized versus non - mineralized bone matrix formation , osteoblast and osteo - clast activities as well as balanced anabolic and catabolic responses . Regarding mineralization , our µCT and histol - ogy results indicated no significant differences over time for both groups . The newly bone matrix formation obtained from Von Kossa / Van Gieson staining decreased at day 5 and then increased within the next 5 days ; however , no sig - nificant differences were observed . We focused on the activities of ALP and TRAP enzymes to further investigate the early bone healing . The osteoblast activity decreased significantly over time for sham group . However , it did not change substantially over time for ZX00 alloy group . We investigated the osteoclast activity using TRAP enzyme histochemistry ; however , we did not observe any osteo - clast in the defined region of both groups ( data not shown ) . Some research groups observed the osteoclast activity after 1 week in vitro and in vivo studies using TRAP stain - ing 80 , 81 ; however , we did not see any osteoclast in the region of interests of both groups ( data not shown ) . This could be because of delays in the osteoclast migration from the cortical bone to the defect site . Studying the balanced anabolic and catabolic responses to the ZX00 alloy implantation compared to sham group , 16 Journal of Tissue Engineering could provide us more details about the alloy potential in stimulating early osteogenic formation . 82 Hence , we stud - ied Runx 2 and Sox 9 activities as two major transcription factors in directing chondrocyte and osteoblast cell fates , correspondingly . 82 The expression of Sox 9 biological marker did not significantly change over time for both groups . Although Runx 2 activity did not change signifi - cantly over time for sham group , it significantly decreased for XZ00 alloy at day 5 and then slightly increased after 10 days , indicating the initiation of bone formation mecha - nisms after 10 days . This also suggests that longer time points should be considered in future studies for better evaluation of bone formation mechanisms . Bone quality Studying the collagen fiber properties ( such as length , width , and alignment ) provides useful information about the effects of implant surface properties on the distribution of stress applied to bone and the quality of bone tissue matrix at the interface . 96 We could obtain some information on collagen fiber properties using Sirius Red histology staining and SAXS analyses . Our histology results indicated improved collagen orientation and alignment over time for the Mg - based alloy ( increased fiber length as well as decreased fiber width and angle ) , suggesting better bone remodeling in this group compared to sham . These results were in line with SAXS results at day 10 , when we detected the strongest ori - entation of HAp and collagen fibers in the cortical bone , pre - senting an orientation parallel to the bone axis . The HAp thickness at the bone - implant interface increased to almost twice ( 3 . 5 – 4 nm ) the size of those in the sham group ( 2 nm ) , indicating bone remodeling after Mg alloy implantation . This was in line with Grün et al . 50 Study , where thicker corti - cal bone structures were detected at the interface , 6 weeks after ZX00 alloy implantation compared to the sham group . 50 Animal model and implant shape ZX00 alloy is mainly designed for pediatric orthopedic trauma . 7 , 50 Because the bone metabolism varies between adults and children , to achieve reliable results , we should test such degradable implants in the juvenile growing - ani - mal models . The bone turnover rate of animal models is more close to children . 50 Grün et al . 50 developed a grow - ing - rat and—sheep animal model for this purpose and con - cluded that the bone healing results in both animals are comparable to that of children . 50 Hence , we used the same animal model to evaluate the early inflammatory responses to the XZ00 alloy developed by Grün et al . 50 Study limitations and future perspectives In this study , we focused on the macrophage polarization and its potential effects on osteogenic responses to implants by considering three early time points ( 2 , 5 , and 10 days post implantation ) . Hence , we cannot make any statement regarding the long - term outcome of ZX00 implantation . Although some studies reported its bone remodeling potential after 1 – 6 months of implantation , 7 , 50 more in vivo studies are essential to evaluate its effects after 1 year to complete degradation . In the case of degradable Mg as a tissue - regenerated biomaterial , not only wound healing processes , but also several other physiological , mechanical , and biochemical pathways are involved , which could play roles in directing host responses to implants . 17 , 18 In this study , we did not examine the effects of alloy degradation products on these pathways at the molecular level , and thus , further investi - gations are required in this direction . Regarding the experimental part of our study , we used 3D µCT as well as 2D histological , immunohistochemical , histomorphometrical , and SAXS analyses to provide a broader overview of the alloy degradation behavior and early host responses to it . The data obtained from all analy - ses were in the same line and supported our hypothesis regarding the comparability of results obtained from 2 and 3D interface imaging technologies . However , we did not use in vivo µCT , which could provide better information about the H 2 gas evolution , and did not consider the earlier time points ( such as few hours after implantation ) . Consequently , we could not draw any conclusions about the gas formation at the interface . Because degradable materials interact chemically with the body , it would be more beneficial to develop chemical techniques to investi - gate the biochemical features of surface biocompatibility after implantation . 97 Furthermore , we did not consider an inert titanium group as control group . However , we believed that owing to the degradability and chemical interactions between Mg surface alloys and the body , their influences on the immune system could not be compared to titanium implants as bio - inert materials . Conclusions Biodegradable alloys made from Mg , Zn , and Ca , known as ZX alloys , have a potential in stimulating pediatric bone healing . In this study , we evaluated the early host responses to Mg 0 . 45wt % Zn - 0 . 45wt % Ca pin - shaped alloy ( known as ZX00 alloy ) in juvenile rat animals 2 , 5 , and 10 days after implantation . Our results indicated that the ZX00 alloy could significantly stimulate macrophage polariza - tion at the implant - bone interface 5 and 10 days after sur - gery . The activity of ( ALP and Runx 2 biological markers reduced significantly for Mg group , demonstrating less osteoblast activity ) . However , after 10 days of implanta - tion , we observed an insignificant improvement of the osteoblast activity ( ALP and Runx 2 ) as well as collagen fibrils alignment and collagen / hydroxyapatite ( HAp ) size , compared to day 5 and sham group at all time . Taken Rahmati et al . 17 together , our results supported that the ZX00 alloy could stimulate the expression of pro - healing type 2 mac - rophages phenotype in vivo ; however , our biomineraliza - tion data did not represent any statistically significant differences over time .
