However , household transmission caused by foreign imported cases has not been reported in China’s border areas . This study aimed to reveal a clear family clustering transmission chain of COVID - 19 caused by contact with Myanmar refugees along the China – Myanmar border during an outbreak in October to November 2021 . Methods : During the outbreak , detailed epidemiological investigations were conducted on conﬁrmed patients with COVID - 19 and their close contacts in daily activities . Patients were immediately transported to a designated hospital for treatment and quarantine , and their close contacts were quarantined at designated sites . Regular nucleic acid testing and SARS - CoV - 2 antibody testing were provided to them . Results : A clear four - generation family clustering transmission involving ﬁve patients with COVID - 19 was found along the China – Myanmar border . The index case ( Patient A ) was infected by brief conversations with Myanmar refugees across border fences during work . His wife ( Patient B ) and 9 - month - old daughter ( Patient C ) were second - generation cases infected by daily contact with him . His 2 - year - old daughter ( Patient D ) was the third - generation case infected by her mother and sister during quarantine in the same room and then transmitted the virus to her grandmother ( Patient E , the fourth - generation case ) who looked after her after Patients B and C were diagnosed and transported to the hospital . The household secondary attack rate was 80 . 0 % , the average latent period was 4 days , and the generation time was 3 days . Ten of 942 close contacts ( 1 . 1 % ) of this family had positive IgM antibody FrontiersinPublicHealth 01 frontiersin . org Yan et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 1004817 during the medical observation period . In total 73 . 9 % ( 696 / 942 ) of them were positive for IgG antibody and 8 . 3 % ( 58 / 696 ) had IgG levels over 20 S / CO ( optical density of the sample / cut - off value of the reagent ) . Conclusion : This typical transmission chain indicated that it is essential to strengthen COVID - 19 prevention and control in border areas , and explore more effective children care approaches in quarantine sites . KEYWORDS COVID - 19 , transmission chain , China - Myanmar border , refugees , outbreak Introduction The highly infectious SARS - CoV - 2 Delta variant strain ( B . 1 . 617 . 2 ) was ﬁrst found in India and spread rapidly around the world and was listed as one of the variants of concern ( VOC ) by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) ( 1 , 2 ) . Since the ﬁrst local coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) patient infected with SARS - CoV - 2 Delta VOC was detected in Guangzhou , China on May 21 , 2021 , Delta VOC has spread to more than 50 cities across China and led to 11 outbreaks , all of which were caused by imported patients with COVID - 19 ( 3 ) . A case in point was the outbreak in Nanjing , China , which was caused by passengers on an international ﬂight transmitting to a cabin cleaner at Nanjing Lukou Airport ( 3 , 4 ) . Household transmission triggered by imported cases was the main pattern of local outbreaks . Close contact in households made it the ideal route for virus transmission . Previous studies reported a relatively high household secondary attack rate in China during the pandemic of COVID - 19 , reaching 15 . 6 % and 12 . 4 – 17 . 1 % in Wuhan and Guangzhou , respectively ( 5 , 6 ) . However , the household transmission of COVID - 19 in China caused by foreign imported patients has not been systematically reported . Mang City is a city in Yunnan Province , China , bordering Myanmar . It is near the Kokang region of northern Shan State in Myanmar , where civil wars often occur , resulting in poor accessibility to basic health services and frequent inﬂux of war refugees into the China – Myanmar border area ( 7 , 8 ) . The China – Myanmar border area is also one of the areas with the greatest risk of overland importation of infectious diseases to China ; for instance , the incidence of malaria was highest in the city along the China – Myanmar border ( 9 – 11 ) . Similarly , the risk of imported COVID - 19 cases from the border also threatened China ( 12 ) . This study aimed to reveal a clear family clustering transmission chain of SARS - CoV - 2 Delta VOC caused by contact with Myanmar refugees along the China – Myanmar border during an outbreak in October 2021 , which could provide practical implications for COVID - 19 prevention and control in border areas . Methods Study procedure On 17 October 2021 , a conﬁrmed patient with COVID - 19 was reported by a local fever clinic in Mang City , Yunnan Province , China . On the same day , the conﬁrmed COVID - 19 case was immediately transported to a designated hospital for treatment and quarantine . An epidemiological investigation was conducted to obtain detailed information on the source of infection , disease onset process , and close contacts . Subsequently , his family members and other close contacts were also quarantined in designated hotels or at home for at least 14 days for medical observation . All conﬁrmed patients and close contacts received epidemiological investigation by the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) on the day they were found . Nasopharyngeal swabs nucleic acid testing ( NAT ) and serum SARS - CoV - 2 antibody testing ( IgM and IgG ) were performed regularly during their medical observation period . Local CDC staﬀ also collected samples and conducted NATs from patients’ working and living environments . Two types of close contacts were included in management . One was the primary close contacts who had direct contacts or ever stayed in a conﬁned space with patients with COVID - 19 , including family members , work colleagues , and people who attended the same clinic ( 13 ) . The other was the secondary close contacts who were close contacts of the primary close contacts of patients with COVID - 19 . Once they were conﬁrmed as COVID - 19 infections by NAT , they were transported from the quarantine hotel or home to the designated hospital . Patients’ and close contacts’ COVID - 19 vaccination records were extracted by matching ID numbers from the vaccination database . For the laboratory testing , real - time reverse transcriptase – polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) targeting at ORF1ab and N genes was conducted using the Novel Coronavirus 2019 Nucleic Acid Test Kit ( Bojie Medical Technology , Shanghai Municipality ; Daan Gene Company , Guangzhou ; Wuhan Easy . Diagnosis Biomedicine Company , Wuhan , China ) , of which the FrontiersinPublicHealth 02 frontiersin . org Yan et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 1004817 test result values have little diﬀerence among the three test kits . The average result values of the three test kits were reported in this study . The detection limit of the cycle threshold ( Ct ) of RT - PCR was 40 , a Ct value of less than 40 was considered NAT positive . The lower Ct value reﬂected a higher viral load and higher transmissibility . For NATs of patients , the results were reported with exact Ct values because of the need for continuous clinical observation ; for NATs of environmental samples , only positive or not of results were reported . SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies were tested using the Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 Rapid Test Kit ( Antubio Diagnostics Company , Zhengzhou , China ) . A value of over 1 S / CO ( optical density of the sample / cut - oﬀ value of the reagent ) was positive for IgM and IgG tests . The biological samples of conﬁrmed patients were also sent to China CDC for further virus genotyping . We received the laboratory test results from China CDC’s report for transmission chain inference . Compared with the reference genome sequence of Wuhan ( GenBank No . NC _ 045512 ) , the China CDC’s report showed the subtype of the SARS - CoV - 2 , mutation site , and homology between patients . Considering that COVID - 19 outbreaks along the China – Myanmar border in China were mainly caused by imported cases from Myanmar ( 14 ) , the gene sequences of the Chinese patients were also compared with those collected in Myanmar . The ethical approval was provided by the Mang City Center for Disease Control and Prevention , Yunnan , China . Statistical analysis The latent period of each patient was calculated as the duration from the earliest possible date of exposure to the date of ﬁrst symptoms onset ( for patients with symptomatic ) or NAT positive ( for patients with asymptomatic ) . The generation time was deﬁned as the time interval between the date of the previous generation infection ( symptoms onset or NAT positive ) and the date of the next - generation infection . The average latent period and generation time were also calculated to estimate the whole family clustering transmission situation . In addition , based on the antibody testing results of close contacts , the positive rate of IgM and IgG antibodies of close contacts were calculated , respectively . Results Basic information about this family The index case ( Patient A ) of the family clustering transmission was a 27 - year - old Chinese male worker on the Chinese side of the China – Myanmar border in Mang City . He lived in the community near his workplace with his wife ( a 27 - year - old Myanmar female living in China [ B ] ) , two daughters ( a 9 - month - old baby [ C ] , and a 2 - year - old girl [ D ] ) , mother ( a 54 - year - old Chinese female [ E ] ) , and father ( a 53 - year - old Chinese male [ F ] ) ( Figure 1A , Table 1 ) . His wife was a housewife , and his parents ran a wine - making business at home . Moreover , his father was the village headman , who was often in charge of the village aﬀairs . Patient A , his wife , and his father have received two doses of inactivated COVID - 19 vaccine . His two daughters were not vaccinated because they did not meet the age requirements for vaccination . Additionally , his mother was not vaccinated because of contraindications to vaccination ( Table 1 ) . Since Patient A was diagnosed on 17 October 2021 , as of 6 November 2021 , four family contacts of Patient A were diagnosed as asymptomatic patients with COVID - 19 successively . All ﬁve patients were infected with the same SARS - CoV - 2 Delta VOC with 44 mutation sites based on virus genotyping and gene sequencing . The household secondary attack rate was 80 % ( 4 / 5 ) . Based on epidemiological investigation and laboratory testing results , we could infer that virus spread in this family for four generations with an average latent period of 4 days and a generation time of 3 days ( Figure 1B , Table 1 ) . Transmission chain Stage 1 . Transmission from Myanmar refugees to patient A Before Patient A was diagnosed , he self - reported that some ﬂu - like symptoms occurred on 15 October 2021 . On 17 October , he was diagnosed as a conﬁrmed patient by regular NAT ( Ct value : 16 . 44 of ORF1ab gene and 14 . 32 of N gene ) ( Table 1 ) . According to the epidemiological investigation , he spent most of his time working , living , and eating at a workplace near the border fences and returned home to care for children during breaks . He declared that he had no contact with other patients with COVID - 19 or anyone with suspected symptoms before he was diagnosed . Because the community he worked and lived in was close to the China – Myanmar border , residents received regular NATs every week provided by the local CDC for early detection of COVID - 19 cases . His last NAT was provided on 14 October 2021 , with negative results , which indicated that he was a newly infected case within 1 week . However , according to further review of his workplace video 1 week before his symptom onset , investigators found that Patient A had two brief conversations ( within 10min ) with Myanmar refugees across the border fences during work on October 13 ( with an old man ) and 14 ( with several adults approaching in succession ) , respectively , when Myanmar refugees poured into the border area of Myanmar near the border fences due to the war in northern Myanmar . During the conversations , Myanmar refugees did not wear facemasks and stood closely with Patient A within 2m , and Patient A sometimes removed the mask because of smoking ( Figure 2 ) . The transmission was conﬁrmed by FrontiersinPublicHealth 03 frontiersin . org Yan et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 1004817 FIGURE1 Index case’s family members and the transmission chain . ( A ) Relationships of index case’s family members and ( B ) transmission chain . gene sequencing . During the epidemiological investigation and disinfection of Patient A’s workplace , some Myanmar refugees sought health services from China’s local CDC’s staﬀ across the border fences and were taken nasopharyngeal swabs for NAT and further gene sequencing . The same SARS - CoV - 2 Delta VOC gene sequence with 44 mutation sites was found among Patient A and the Myanmar refugees’ COVID - 19 cases . Stage 2 . Transmission from patient A to patients B and C After Patient A was diagnosed and transported to the designated hospital , his family was also transported to the designated quarantine hotel for medical observation on 17 October . On 18 October , Patient A’s wife ( Patient B ) and second daughter ( Patient C ) were diagnosed as newly infected asymptomatic cases with positive NAT results because their last NAT results on October 14 were negative . Their antibody testing results could also prove it . Patient B had only a positive IgM result one day after being diagnosed , but both IgM and IgG presented positive 10 days later . Patient C had negative IgG and IgM antibody results on 19 October , but both had positive results on 31 October 2021 ( Table 1 ) . Patient B had no contact with other patients with COVID - 19 except her husband . Patient C’s daily contacts were mainly with her family . Therefore , it can be inferred that these two patients were the secondary cases in the family . Between 12 October and 15 October , Patient A did not live at home , but he went home to help her wife bathe the baby during mealtime every day , and he went to the bank with his wife and child on 14 October . On 16 October , Patients A , B , and C ate and slept together overnight , and two NAT - positive environmental samples were detected on the bedroom ﬂoor and the head of the bed . These direct contacts made the spread of the virus possible ( Figure 2 ) . Stage 3 . Transmission from patients B and C to patient D When the family members were transported to the designated quarantine hotel , Patient A’s parents were quarantined in separate rooms . Since the two daughters of Patient A were too young to take care of themselves , they were quarantined in the same room of the quarantine hotel with their mother ( Patient B ) until 19 October , when Patients B and C were diagnosed as conﬁrmed cases and were transported to the designated hospital . After that , the elder daughter was still quarantined in the hotel and was provided regular NATs every 3 days . Her NATs results were negative on 18 October and 21 October . However , the NAT results turned positive on 24 October without symptoms occurring . The girl became the fourth patient with COVID - 19 ( Patient D ) . The negative NAT result on 21 October showed that she could have been in the latent infection period . Except that the date of Patient D’s NAT positive was about 1 week later than Patients B and C , the epidemiological investigation also showed Patient D was less likely to be transmitted by Patient A because Patient D was usually taken care of by her grandparents and the direct contacts between Patients A and D were rare on these days . Therefore , Patient D was considered as the third - generation case transmitted by her mother and younger sister ( the second - generation cases Patients B and C ) during the same - room quarantine ( Figure 2 ) . Stage 4 . Transmission from patient D to patient E On 24 October , the same day that Patient D was diagnosed , Patient A’s mother ( Patient E ) was also diagnosed with an asymptomatic case . Patient E’s last negative NAT result was on 21 October , suggesting that she was also newly infected .

First , the date of Patient E’s NAT positive was about 1 week later than secondary cases B and C ; second , the direct contact between Patients A and E were rare because Patients A and E did not live in the same room at home , and Patient E spent her time running the wine - making business , but Patient A spent very little time at home after October 12 and did not help Patient E with her work . In addition , the possibility of the transmission from Patient B or C to Patient E was also small because after the families were transported to quarantine , Patient E was not quarantined in the same room as Patients B and C , and they had no direct contact during the quarantine . The most possible transmission was from Patient D to E because when Patients B and C were diagnosed and were transported from the hotel to the designated hospital , Patient D was sent to her grandmother’s ( Patient E ) room since she was too young to stay alone . At that time , she had already been infected but was in the latent period . Two pieces of evidence could prove the transmission . First , environmental sample testing on October 25 showed that in the quarantine room of Patients D and E , the samples collected from the Patient D’s slippers , toilet , ﬂoor , table , trash can , bedding , and cup showed positive NAT results , which showed the possibility of transmission in this room . Second , changes in the Ct values of Patients D and E also provided clues of transmission . Considering the process of virus replication and elimination in the human body , the viral load was low at the early stages of infection , and then decreased after an increasing period ( 15 ) . Therefore , the Ct values presented a U - shaped curve . For Patient E , we could clearly observe the U - shaped Ct value curve after October 24 ; however , the Ct value of Patient D kept going up , suggesting that Patient D got infected earlier than Patient E ( Supplement Figure S1 ) . Therefore , Patient E could be considered as the fourth - generation case transmitted by her elder granddaughter ( the third - generation Patient D ) during the quarantine in the same room ( Figure 2 ) . Medical observation of patients’ close contacts A total of 946 close contacts of these patients were found through epidemiological investigation and travel history big data , including 134 primary close contacts and 812 secondary close contacts . Except for four families of Patient A were diagnosed as patients with COVID - 19 later , no other patients with COVID - 19 were conﬁrmed by NAT among these 942 close contacts . However , 10 of the 942 close contacts ( 1 . 1 % ) had positive IgM antibodies during their medical observation period . In total 73 . 9 % ( 696 / 942 ) of them had positive IgG antibody and 8 . 3 % ( 58 / 696 ) of the IgG - positive persons had an IgG level over 20 S / CO . FrontiersinPublicHealth 06 frontiersin . org Yan et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 1004817 It was worth noting that as high - risk primary close contacts , Patient A’s father and his colleagues were not diagnosed as patients with COVID - 19 , which might partly owe to all of them having been vaccinated against COVID - 19 . Another reason was the characteristics of their direct contacts . After 12 October , Patient A started to work on duty , while his father had to handle village aﬀairs and the wine business , and the direct contact time between the two was very short . For contact with his colleagues , Patient A wore facemasks during work hours and did not live in the same room as his colleagues . Discussion This is the ﬁrst study to reveal a clear transmission chain of SARS - CoV - 2 Delta VOC along the China – Myanmar border , which mixed the cross - border overland transmission and family clustering transmission . Because of the large cross - border population movement in border areas , tracing the source of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission is always diﬃcult . This study is the ﬁrst to tease out the chain of transmission at its source along the China – Myanmar border , which could contribute to COVID - 19 prevention and control in border areas . The index case was infected by Myanmar refugees who poured into the border area of Myanmar near the border fences due to the war in northern Myanmar . The infection process was only through brief conversations across the border fences , indicating that the brief companion of time and space outdoors was enough for SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Previous studies have indicated that SARS - CoV - 2 could spread through aerosols , survive , and maintain infectivity for up to 16h ( 16 , 17 ) . Coughing and sneezing could help SARS - CoV - 2 spread through the small droplets for a potential long distance of up to 7 – 8m ( 17 , 18 ) . Problems caused by a refugee in border areas are major challenges for many countries . Recently , Poland – Belarus border refugee crisis has intensiﬁed , and many refugees from the Middle East have poured into the border areas of Poland and Belarus , trying to reach Western European countries ( 19 ) . The gathering of crowds increased the risk of COVID - 19 spreading among refugees , and also added to the pressure on border epidemic prevention and control in countries of entry . The hometowns of the refugees were war - torn countries that often did not have the ﬁnancial capacity to provide enough COVID - 19 prevention and testing services . Therefore , international exchange as well as humanitarian aid , coordination , and strategy should be strengthened , which requires to collaborate between governments , the WHO , the International Red Cross , various foundations , and other departments to provide not only basic living necessities but also COVID - 19 vaccinations , testing , and treatment services ( 20 ) . For border areas of entry countries , regular disinfection around the border fences needs to be implemented . It is also essential to strengthen publicity and education , including wearing masks and other protective equipment during work and outdoors , being proactive with COVID - 19 vaccination , and reducing close proximity to border fences and contacts with refugees . In addition , providing regular NAT to workers and residents in border areas can eﬀectively detect COVID - 19 cases in time to prevent the further spread of the epidemic . Quarantine site management is also a global issue , with several quarantine system failures reported in Australia and New Zealand ( 21 ) . In this transmission chain , Patient D , the 2 - year - old girl , was the pivot . After being infected by her mother and sister , she transmitted the virus to her grandmother in the quarantine site , reﬂecting that the children’s care would be an important issue in management . Compared with home quarantine , centralized quarantine management is indeed essential for controlling the spread of the virus as soon as possible and helps to carry out the thorough disinfection of COVID - 19 patients’ homes and workplaces . In this study , quarantine in a separate room in a centralized quarantine site eﬀectively prevented the index case’s father from getting infected . However , the children who could not take care of themselves became the unavoidable source of infection in the quarantine site . Therefore , it is imperative to explore more eﬀective mechanisms for the management of children in quarantine sites , including developing standards to determine whether children need to be separated from their families in quarantine , arranging specialized healthcare workers to take care of children in quarantine , and providing psychological counseling and care services for mothers and children . In addition , though no other close contacts of these patients were diagnosed as COVID - 19 cases by NAT , 10 of them had positive IgM test results and 58 had IgG results of over 20 S / CO , which was considered as the standard for identifying probable cases in China – Myanmar border area ( 12 ) . Previous studies also reported potentially infected cases with negative NAT results but positive antibody results in Guangdong province and Liaoning province , China ( 22 , 23 ) . It is worth exploring further whether they were actually infected and could conceal transmission of the virus . Our study also had a limitation . Because of the high mobility of refugees and the diﬃculty in communication , it was impossible to identify the exact person who transmitted SARS - CoV - 2 to Patient A . However , the homology of the sequencing indicated that Patient A was infected by Myanmar refugees . In conclusion , this study revealed a clear transmission chain of SARS - CoV - 2 Delta VOC mixing the cross - border overland transmission and family clustering transmission along the China – Myanmar border . It is essential to strengthen COVID - 19 prevention and control in border FrontiersinPublicHealth 07 frontiersin . org Yan et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 1004817 areas and explore more eﬀective children - care approaches in quarantine sites .
