Bead size had a profound effect on all aspects of motility , with increasing size causing slower , straighter movement and inhibiting symmetry - breaking . Speed also was reduced by extract dilution , by addition of methylcellulose , and paradoxically by addition of excess skeletal muscle actin , but it was enhanced by addition of nonmuscle ( platelet ) actin . Large , persistent individual variations in speed were observed for all conditions and their relative magnitude increased with extract dilution , indicating that persistent alterations in particle surface properties may be responsible for intrinsic speed variations . Trajectory curvature was increased for smaller beads and also for particles moving in the presence of methylcellulose or excess skeletal muscle actin . Symmetry breaking and movement initiation occurred by two distinct modes : either stochastic ampliﬁcation of local variation for small beads in concentrated extracts , or gradual accumulation of strain in the actin gel for large beads in dilute extracts . Neither mode was sufﬁcient to enable spherical particles to break symmetry in the cytoplasm of living cells . INTRODUCTION The actin - based motility of intracellular bacterial pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes , in which moving bacteria leave in their wake a characteristic comet - like tail of cross - linked actin ﬁlaments ( Tilney and Portnoy , 1989 ) , has served as a useful model for understanding some aspects of the dynamics of actin assembly at the leading edge of motile cells ( Cameron et al . , 2000 ; Pollard et al . , 2000 ; Pantaloni et al . , 2001 ) . Biochemical analysis of this form of actin - based mo - tility has been greatly facilitated by the ability of L . monocy - togenes to move normally in cell - free cytoplasmic extracts from eggs ( Theriot et al . , 1994 ) , platelets ( Welch et al . , 1998 ) , or brain tissue ( May et al . , 1999 ) . Identiﬁcation of the mole - cules involved in this process has culminated in the recon - stitution of bacterial actin - based motility by using puriﬁed proteins ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) . Only one bacterial factor , ActA , is required for L . monocytogenes to perform actin - based mo - tility in infected cells ( Kocks et al . , 1992 ) , cytoplasmic extracts ( Kocks et al . , 1995 ; Smith et al . , 1995 ) , or an appropriate mixture of puriﬁed proteins ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ; Samarin et al . , 2003 ) . In addition to actin and ATP , just three host cell proteins are absolutely required for comet tail formation and movement ; the Arp2 / 3 complex for dendritic actin nucle - ation , capping protein to limit ﬁlament elongation , and ADF / coﬁlin to accelerate ﬁlament depolymerization ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) . Three additional proteins enhance the speed or stability of movement ; VASP , proﬁlin , and (cid:1) - actinin ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) . After the biochemical characterization of the bacterial and host cell factors necessary and sufﬁcient for this form of actin - based movement , attention has turned toward under - standing the biophysics of motility driven by actin polymer - ization by using artiﬁcial particles such as polystyrene beads or phospholipid vesicles as replacements for the bacterial cargo ( Cameron et al . , 1999 ; van Oudenaarden and Theriot , 1999 ; Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ; Giardini et al . , 2003 ; Upadhyaya et al . , 2003 ) . Polystyrene beads coated with a variety of proteins that activate actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex are capable of generating superﬁcially sim - ilar actin comet tails and moving unidirectionally in several kinds of cytoplasmic extracts ( Cameron et al . , 1999 ; Yarar et al . , 1999 ) and mixtures of puriﬁed proteins ( Bernheim - Gros - wasser et al . , 2002 ; Samarin et al . , 2003 ; Wiesner et al . , 2003 ) . There are important quantitative and qualitative differences among the various reconstituted motility systems with re - spect to the identities of the proteins that can support actin comet tail formation , the size of particles capable of initiat - ing movement , the structural organization of the actin comet tail , and the biophysical parameters governing movement . For example , very large beads ( up to 10 (cid:2) m in diameter ) are capable of breaking symmetry and initiating movement in a mixture of puriﬁed proteins ( Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ) , whereas symmetry - breaking is observed only for sub - micron particles in concentrated cytoplasmic extracts ( Cam - Article published online ahead of print .

Addition of methylcellulose to cytoplasmic extracts to increase their effective viscosity signiﬁcantly de - creases bacterial speed ( McGrath et al . , 2003 ) , but similar addition of methylcellulose to a mixture of puriﬁed proteins has only modest effects on the speed of N - WASP – coated polystyrene beads ( Wiesner et al . , 2003 ) . Beads coated with the VCA domain of N - WASP cannot initiate movement in brain cytoplasmic extracts ( Suetsugu et al . , 2001 ) , although they can in a mixture of puriﬁed proteins ( Bernheim - Gros - wasser et al . , 2002 ) . It is currently unknown whether these types of differences are primarily due to the reduced bio - chemical complexity of the puriﬁed protein system or to general physical differences between the two types of sys - tems such as overall protein concentration or viscosity . Two recent articles have examined the effects of system - atic variation of biophysical parameters , including particle size and surface protein density on various quantitative parameters of actin - based motility by using polystyrene beads coated with N - WASP or the VCA domain of N - WASP in a mixture of puriﬁed proteins ( Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ; Wiesner et al . , 2003 ) . In this report , we have sys - tematically and quantitatively compared the motility of live bacteria expressing ActA and of ActA - coated polystyrene beads in biochemically complex cytoplasmic extracts while varying a series of biophysical parameters , including parti - cle size , ActA surface density , extract dilution , actin concen - tration , and viscosity . We ﬁnd a continuum of changes in particle behavior , indicating that biochemically similar mechanisms for generation of actin - based motility can pro - duce quantitatively and qualitatively distinct behaviors in different biophysical regimes . MATERIALS AND METHODS ActA - coated Beads Protein puriﬁcation and bead coating was performed as described previously ( Cameron et al . , 1999 ) . A hexa - histidine – tagged form of ActA was puriﬁed from strain DP - L2723 of L . monocytogenes ( a gift from Daniel Portnoy , Uni - versity of California , Berkeley , CA ) expressing a truncated actA gene encod - ing amino acids 1 – 613 ( Welch et al . , 1998 ) . Carboxylated polystyrene beads ( Polysciences , Warrington , PA ) of size 0 . 2 – 2 (cid:2) m were incubated in protein solution containing the stated percentage of ActA - His and supplemented with ovalbumin to 2 mg / ml ﬁnal protein concentration . In all cases , condi - tions were such that the amount of protein was saturating . For example , 2 (cid:2) l of 0 . 5 (cid:2) m beads ( 2 . 5 % solids ) were added to 10 (cid:2) l of protein solution ; the volume of beads was adjusted to account for changes in surface area for beads of different sizes . ActA binding to the surface of the beads ( over the range of surface densities ) was conﬁrmed by SDS - PAGE . Motility Assays Bead motility assays were performed as described previously ( Cameron et al . , 1999 ) by adding ActA - His – coated beads to Xenopus laevis egg cytoplasmic extract supplemented with tetramethylrhodamine iodoacetamide - labeled ac - tin and ATP - regenerating mix . The assay mixture was incubated on ice brieﬂy before making a sample slide for as long as 1 h , depending on parameters in the particular experiment . Then , a 1 . 2 - (cid:2) l sample was removed and squashed between a microscope slide and 22 - mm 2 glass coverslip and sealed with Vaseline : lanolin : parafﬁn at 1 : 1 : 1 . The preparation was incubated at room temperature for between 15 min and 1 h in the dark before observing on the microscope , depending on the experiment . Most observations were per - formed on an Axioplan2 microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Thornwood , NY ) equipped with phase contrast and epiﬂuorescence optics . Time - lapse microscopy was achieved with a digital cooled charge - coupled device ( CCD ) camera ( Micro - MAX : 512BFT , Princeton Instruments , Roper Scientiﬁc , Trenton , NJ ) special - ized for low light level and high frequency imaging , by using MetaMorph ( Universal Imaging , Media , PA ) software . Every 10 s , phase contrast ( with 50 - ms exposure ) and ﬂuorescence ( 400 - ms exposures ) image pairs were re - corded . Some observations were performed on a Nikon Diaphot - 300 inverted microscope equipped with phase contrast and epiﬂuorescence optics with an attached intensiﬁed CCD camera ( Dage - MTI GenIISys / CCD - c72 ) for time - lapse videomicroscopy . Video images were captured , digitized , and analyzed using MetaMorph software . Phase contrast and ﬂuorescence image pairs were recorded every 10 s with eight video frames averaged at each time point . Bead trajectories were tracked by hand using the MetaMorph software Track Points function to denote the coordinates of the center of each bead in the phase contrast image at the pixel level . Bacteria ( L . monocytogenes strain SLCC - 5764 ) were tracked similarly , but coordinates corresponded to the end of the bac - teria associated with the actin tail . Extract Alterations Crude egg extract was diluted from full strength with XB ( 100 mM KCl , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 10 mM K - HEPES , pH 7 . 7 ) to a range of extract concentrations denoted as the percentage of full - strength extract . In addition to diluting extracts with XB , some crude extract samples were diluted with methylcellulose 4000 ( M - 0512 ; Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) to a ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 2 % . The methylcellulose equivalent of crude extract viscosity is 0 . 2 % ( for M - 0512 ; by falling ball assay ) ; thus , dilution with this concentration of an unreactive macromolecular viscosity agent keeps the viscosity of the diluted extract the same while diluting the protein concen - tration . Measurements were performed as described above for fraction of beads that form tails and average speed of moving beads . For some experi - ments , puriﬁed monomeric actin from rabbit skeletal muscle ( Pardee and Spudich , 1982 ) or human platelets ( Schaier , 1992 ) was added to X . laevis egg extract . The concentration of actin in X . laevis egg extract was determined to be 7 (cid:2) M by the DNase I inhibition assay ( Nefsky and Bretscher , 1992 ) . To prevent unintentional actin ﬁlament formation the components were mixed in the following order : X . laevis egg extract , G - actin , XB salts , and then beads . G - buffer was substituted for XB in some experiments to test whether the salt concentration in XB was affecting actin ﬁlament formation . No difference in ﬁlament formation ( assayed by ﬂuorescence microscopy ) was detected be - tween XB and G - buffer , so XB was used as the dilution buffer in actin add back experiments . Speed and Motility Initiation Analysis Average speed was measured using MetaMorph software tracking function to measure distance moved per time point for beads moving in at least 10 and up to 90 consecutive frames . For the measurement of fraction of beads with tails , the number of clouds and tails in three to six different ﬁelds was counted using a standard cell counter or by capturing single frames of different ﬁelds of view and then counting number of clouds and tails . At least 150 and up to 1000 beads were counted for each sample parameter . Curvature Analysis The X - Y coordinates obtained from the Track Points function of MetaMorph software were analyzed for angular deviation by plotting the average cosine of the angle formed by all possible pairs of segments in a trajectory separated by x (cid:2) m ( Auerbuch et al . , 2003 ) . Averages for which (cid:1) 30 independent measurements could be made were excluded . Particle Attachment Small ﬂuorescent beads were attached to the surface of L . monocytogenes as described previously ( Robbins and Theriot , 2003 ) . L . monocytogenes hyper - hemolytic strain SLCC - 5764 were grown overnight in brain - heart infusion at 37°C with shaking . Bacteria were then washed and resuspended in (cid:2) 1 : 10 volumes of XB buffer and then incubated in a 1 : 1 ratio with 0 . 05 - (cid:2) m - diameter YG ﬂuorescent carboxylated microspheres ( Polysciences ) , which had been diluted to 0 . 0025 % solids . Incubation times varied from 1 to 10 min . Assays were performed at a ﬁnal X . laevis extract concentration of 50 % . At least three trajectories were tracked for each bacterium using the MetaMorph Track Points function : one representing the bacterial end associated with the comet tail , one for the opposite end and one for each bead . The former two were tracked using phase contrast images and the latter from ﬂuorescent images separated by a ﬁxed amount of time ( (cid:2) 0 . 3 s ) . Bead displacement was calcu - lated by orthogonal projection of the bead coordinate onto the line formed through the two bacterial end coordinates . Delivery of Beads into Cells Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells expressing green ﬂuorescent pro - tein ( GFP ) - actin were cultured on coverslips as described previously ( Robbins et al . , 1999 ) . For delivery of beads by using the gene gun , plastic tubing was cut into 0 . 5 - inch segments to serve as “bullets . ” Droplets of buffer containing 0 . 2 - (cid:2) m - diameter ActA - coated beads were placed on the interior sides of the tubes , and the bullets were chilled overnight at 4°C for drying . Dried beads retained normal motility in X . laevis egg extracts after resuspension . Bullets were loaded into the chamber of a Helios gene gun ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) . Media were aspirated from monolayers of MDCK cells expressing GFP - actin , and the gun was ﬁred from 2 – 4 inches away at 250 – 300 psi . For delivery of beads by internalization , MBP - invasin and His - tagged listeriolysin O were puriﬁed as described previously ( Leong et al . , 1990 ; Gedde et al . , 2000 ) . ActA - coated beads were incubated for 30 min in MBP - invasin , rinsed twice in 20 % phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , incubated for 15 min at room temper - ature in 30 mM nickel sulfate , rinsed twice in 20 % PBS , resuspended in full - strength PBS , and incubated in His - LLO as described previously ( Monack and Theriot , 2001 ) . Triple - coated beads also retained normal motility in X . laevis egg extracts . Protein - coated beads were spun onto MDCK cells express - Biophysics of Actin - based Motility Vol . 15 , May 2004 2313 ing GFP - actin , which were plated on glass coverslips held in six - well plates in a clinical centrifuge . RESULTS Large ActA - coated Particles Move in Diluted Cellular Extracts Actin - based motility of ActA - coated polysytrene beads in cell - free cytoplasmic extract of X . laevis eggs has previously been shown to be size dependent , where particles (cid:3) 0 . 5 (cid:2) m in diameter fail to initiate movement ( Cameron et al . , 1999 ) . The most dramatic difference between motility in cytoplas - mic extracts and in mixtures of puriﬁed proteins is the ability of the latter to support the movement initiation of very large ( 10 - (cid:2) m ) beads ( Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ) . To test whether larger beads could move in cytoplasmic extracts where protein concentration and viscosity were lower , more closely approximating the puriﬁed protein sys - tems , we added large ActA - coated beads ( 0 . 7 – 2 (cid:2) m in di - ameter ) to X . laevis egg extract , which was diluted ( by vol - ume ) from full - strength crude extract with isotonic buffer . We found that if the extract was diluted to 40 % of the original crude extract concentration , larger beads ( up to 0 . 9 (cid:2) m in diameter ) formed actin tails and moved ( Figure 1B ) . Beads as large as 2 (cid:2) m in diameter exhibited symmetry - breaking and actin - based motility in extract diluted to 20 % of its initial concentration ( Figure 1A ) . To determine the effect of dilution on quantitative param - eters of motility , a range of bead sizes ( 0 . 2 – 2 (cid:2) m in diameter ) were coated with ActA protein and added to crude X . laevis egg extract that was diluted with various amounts of iso - tonic buffer and the average speed of each moving particle was measured . Small beads that move in crude extract ( 0 . 2 – 0 . 5 (cid:2) m in diameter ) moved signiﬁcantly more slowly in extracts diluted with isotonic buffer ( by rank - sum test for all data sets with n (cid:3) 10 ; Figure 1B and Table 1 ) , conﬁrming previous observations ( Cameron et al . , 2001 ) . Larger beads ( 0 . 7 – 2 (cid:2) m ) , which do not move in crude undiluted extracts ( Cameron et al . , 1999 ) , were able to form tails and move in extract diluted to 20 % , but more slowly than all smaller beads tested ( Figure 1B ) . The decrease in speed ( in 20 % extract ) as the diameter increases suggests that average speed is dependent on bead size in this regime . Small beads ( 0 . 2 and 0 . 35 (cid:2) m in diameter ) moved slower than 0 . 5 - (cid:2) m beads in both 100 and 40 % extract , indicating that 0 . 5 (cid:2) m is the optimal size for efﬁcient motility . Polymerization - dependent Rearward Movement of Actin Tails Attached to a Subset of Large Beads Most large beads ( 0 . 7 – 0 . 9 (cid:2) m ) added to diluted extract moved in a similar manner to small beads ( 0 . 2 – 0 . 5 (cid:2) m ) . This was conﬁrmed by a combination of phase and ﬂuorescence microscopy , which demonstrated that the addition of new actin subunits at the interface of the bead and the actin tail propelled the large beads forward in diluted extracts , whereas the tail remained stationary , as seen previously for small beads in undiluted crude extract ( Cameron et al . , 1999 ) and as originally demonstrated for ActA - directed actin - based motility by bacteria in infected cells ( Sanger et al . , 1992 ; Theriot et al . , 1992 ) . However , observations of the motility of 2 - (cid:2) m beads in 20 % extract revealed that a subset ( (cid:2) 30 % ) of these large beads moved at a slower rate , and the ﬂuorescence in the actin tail was not stationary but seemed to be moving away from the surface of the bead , in contrast to the normal situation where the actin comet tail is stationary and the bead moves forward . We analyzed the rearward ﬂow of Figure 1 . Large beads move in diluted extracts . Beads were coated with 37 . 5 % ActA and added to diluted extract , which was 20 % of full - strength crude extract . ( A ) Beads 0 . 7 (cid:2) m ( left ) , 0 . 9 (cid:2) m ( middle ) , and 2 (cid:2) m ( top and bottom right ) in diameter all form tails in diluted extracts . Micrometer diameter of the bead noted in the bottom left of each image . ( B ) Average speeds of beads ( 0 . 2 – 2 (cid:2) m in diameter ( x - axis ) added to crude ( 100 % , ﬁlled squares ) , 40 % extract ( ﬁlled diamonds ) , or 20 % extract ( open circles ) were calculated from tracked position . Error bars are SD . ( C ) Retrograde ﬂux of actin tail on 2 - (cid:2) m bead . A rectangular region containing bead and ﬂuores - cence in tail ( black box in left image ) is monitored at each 10 - s time interval . The position of the region is shown in the ﬁrst time point in the image on the left , and the region at each consecutive 10 - s time point is presented from 0 to 440 s as a stacked image on the right ( “kymograph” function in MetaMorph ) . A line denoting the posi - tion of the bead is shown on the left and a line denoting the ﬂuorescence intensity shift to the right is shown on the right in the kymograph . The slope is calculated and based on the time and the distance , the rate of movement of the bead position and the ﬂuo - rescence intensity of a spot were calculated . The bead is moving to the left at 0 . 0052 (cid:2) m / s , and the tail is moving to the right at 0 . 004 (cid:2) m / s . The sum of these rates equals approximately the same rate as 2 - (cid:2) m beads moving without retrograde ﬂux . Bars , 2 (cid:2) m . L . A . Cameron et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2314 actin in the tail over time by monitoring the ﬂuorescence intensity of a region of interest containing both the bead and a section of the tail . A kymograph ( stacking the series of 10 - s time points of the ﬂuorescence intensity map of a boxed region in a column ) allowed us to measure both the forward movement of the bead and rearward movement of the tail as the slope drawn through two constant points ( the bead and a point in the tail ) in that column ( Figure 1C ) . Interestingly , these two rates added together equaled the approximate rate of motility of 2 - (cid:2) m beads with normal tails that were not exhibiting rearward ﬂux , indicating that the net rate of actin gel growth at the surface remained unchanged and the force due to actin polymerization was being partitioned between forward movement of the bead and retrograde movement of the actin tail . Retrograde ﬂow of actin ﬁlaments has been previously demonstrated to be a myosin - dependent process in growth cones ( Lin et al . , 1996 ) , but theoretically it could be driven by the free energy of actin polymerization ( Hill and Kirschner , 1982 ) . Average Speed Is Determined by the Surrounding Environment The ﬁnding that larger beads move in diluted extract en - abled us to analyze a much larger matrix of variables and their effects on actin - based motility than had been previ - ously experimentally accessible . These variables included particle size , environment ( both viscosity and host protein concentration ) , and ActA surface density on beads ( Table 1 ) . Several interesting trends emerged . As described above , ActA - coated beads moved signiﬁ - cantly more slowly in extracts diluted with an isotonic buffer than in crude extract ( for all bead sizes and ActA surface densities by rank - sum test for all data sets with n (cid:3) 10 ) ( Figures 1B and 2A and Table 1 ) . L . monocytogenes also exhibited this decrease in speed in diluted extracts , demon - strating that the effect was not unique to microspheres , but a genuine property of the surrounding extract environment ( Figure 2A and Table 1 ) . Dilution of crude X . laevis egg extract has two main effects : decreased viscosity of the ex - tract and dilution of protein components in the extract that may be required for motility . To determine whether the decrease in speed of moving beads in diluted extracts was due to a decrease in viscosity , we increased the viscosity of 40 % extract by adding methylcellulose , an inert macrovis - cosity agent , until the viscosity of crude extract was restored . Diluting the extract from full - strength crude extract to 40 % of crude extract decreased the viscosity from (cid:2) 2 . 4 centipoise to 1 . 4 centipoise ; 0 . 2 % methylcellulose restored the viscosity of 40 % extract to that of crude extract as conﬁrmed by falling ball assay . In this way , we can directly compare the motility of beads in 40 % extract , which has both decreased extract viscosity and decreased protein concentration , to motility in 40 % extract with higher viscosity ( 0 . 2 % methylcellulose ; M - 0512 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) .

Biophysics of Actin - based Motility Vol . 15 , May 2004 2315 methylcellulose moved at a signiﬁcantly lower speed ( by both rank - sum and Student’s t - test , p (cid:1) 0 . 05 ) than beads in diluted extract the absence of methylcellulose ( Figure 2A ) , consistent with similar observations on addition of methyl - cellulose ( M - 0387 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) to bovine brain cytoplas - mic extracts ( McGrath et al . , 2003 ) . This decrease in speed in the presence of methylcellulose is probably not due to a decrease in the rate of actin polymerization , because it has been shown that even higher levels of methylcellulose do not alter actin polymerization ( McGrath et al . , 2003 ) . In con - trast , addition of various length methylcellulose polymer at concentrations up to 4 % ( 20 - fold higher than used in this study ; M - 0512 , M - 0262 , and M - 7140 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) to a puriﬁed protein system was reported to have highly variable but not reproducibly signiﬁcant effects on the speed of 2 - (cid:2) m beads coated with N - WASP ( Wiesner et al . , 2003 ) . Whether the variation in the effects of methylcellulose is due purely to its effects on viscosity or on other aspects of the system such as actin ﬁlament bundling ( Wiesner et al . , 2003 ) or elonga - tion rates ( Drenckhahn and Pollard , 1986 ) that may differ between extracts and a puriﬁed protein system remains to be determined . In infected cells , effective cytoplasmic viscosity for large particles is very high compared with extracts or puriﬁed protein mixtures , but increasing the mobility of bacteria by removing intermediate ﬁlaments has no effect on speed ( Giardini and Theriot , 2001 ) , suggesting that under normal biological conditions environmental viscosity is only a minor determinant of average speed . If the slower rate of bead motility in diluted extracts is not due to a decrease in viscosity caused by dilution with iso - tonic buffer , it might be due to the reduction in the concen - tration of protein components in the extract . We chose to test speciﬁcally the effect of altered monomeric actin concentra - tion , which for technical reasons has not been examined in the puriﬁed protein system ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) . The concen - tration of actin in the crude X . laevis egg extract used in this work was measured by DNase I assay to be 7 (cid:2) M , whereas 40 % diluted extract contains (cid:2) 2 . 8 (cid:2) M actin . By adding back monomeric actin to extract diluted to 40 % , we tested whether the increase in actin concentration restores the av - erage speed of moving beads . Surprisingly , 0 . 5 - (cid:2) m beads in extract diluted with isotonic buffer and with additional rab - bit skeletal muscle actin moved slower than beads in diluted extract without any additional actin , and the speed de - creased further as more actin was added . However , beads in 40 % extract with nonmuscle human platelet actin added moved signiﬁcantly faster than beads in diluted extract without added actin ( Figure 2B ) . These ﬁndings are consis - tent with the simple hypothesis that actin ﬁlament elonga - tion can be rate limiting for movement and raise the concern that skeletal muscle actin may behave anomalously in cell - free reconstituted systems for actin - based motility . Individual Speed Is Persistent and Determined by Features of the Individual Extract dilution not only affects the speed of bead motility but also alters the variability in movement from one time point to the next . Calculating the SD around the mean of the instantaneous velocities for each individual bead reveals the degree of speed variation of the bead within each measured track . We calculated this and normalized the variability to average speed ( Table 2 ) . We also examined the distribution of instantaneous velocities across the entire population for each condition and found that the variation from one bead to another was always greater than the variation in speed within a single bead track , consistent with ﬁndings for bac - teria in cells ( Kuo and McGrath , 2000 ; Giardini and Theriot , 2001 ) . This result suggests that , although the local environ - ment determines the range of speeds available to an indi - vidual , speciﬁc features of the individual and its recent history determine the exact average “set - point” speed it selects . The individual is then able to maintain that speed with a high degree of persistence over time scales of at least several minutes . Interestingly , the relative amount of indi - vidual - to - individual variation increased in diluted extracts , whereas the relative amount of internal speed variation remained essentially constant and was independent of vis - cosity ( Table 2 ) . This observation suggests that the set - point differences among individuals may be due in part to a persistent biochemical alteration of the particle surface , for example , the recruitment to the surface of soluble factor that binds cooperatively and has a relatively slow off - rate . Pos - sible candidates include members of the Ena / VASP protein Figure 2 . Decreasing viscosity via extract dilution and altering actin concentration changes average speed . ( A ) The 0 . 5 - (cid:2) m beads coated with 37 . 5 % ActA ( ﬁlled diamond ) or L . monocytogenes strain SLCC - 5764 ( open circle ) were added to various extract dilutions and to 40 % extract diluted with methylcellulose to 0 . 2 % ﬁnal viscosity . Average speeds in different conditions were calculated and plotted versus extract condition . ( B ) Average speed of 0 . 5 - (cid:2) m beads coated with 37 . 5 % ActA in 40 % extract with puriﬁed G - actin added . Error bars are SD . In two different extract preparations ( designated a and c ) , addition of 2 . 4 or 6 . 4 (cid:2) M rabbit skeletal muscle actin ( sk . ) signiﬁcantly decreased speed . In contrast , addition of 2 . 4 (cid:2) M hu - man platelet actin ( plat . ) signiﬁcantly increased speed . L . A . Cameron et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2316 family ( Auerbuch et al . , 2003 ) , although unknown factors may also contribute . Path Curvature Varies According to Object Size and Shape We noticed that the behavior of individual beads and bac - teria varied not only with respect to speed but also with respect to the path that the bead or bacterium followed . For example , a plot of the x and y coordinates for each 10 - s time point of several individual 0 . 5 - (cid:2) m - diameter beads moving in crude extract shows that the beads tend to follow smooth paths , curving only gradually ( Figure 3A ) . In contrast , the paths followed by 0 . 2 - (cid:2) m - diameter beads were more erratic than those of larger beads ( and bacteria ) , exhibiting more frequent and tighter turns ( Figure 3B ) . We can quantitate the path curvature , or the bead’s pro - pensity to turn , by calculating the average cosine of the angle formed by the coordinates of the bead position in pairs of track segments separated by progressively increasing dis - tances ( Figure 3C ) . Thus , a bead that has perfect path per - sistence , i . e . , one with a trajectory that does not curve , would have a 0° angle separating any pair of track segments re - gardless of the distance between segments . Its cosine as a function of path length would be a straight line at 1 . The plot of a trajectory with a random , erratic path would fall quickly to 0 . Figure 3C includes such plots for the data in both Figure 3A ( 0 . 5 - (cid:2) m beads , open diamonds ) and 3B ( 0 . 2 - (cid:2) m beads , bars ) within it . Comparison of the path curvature of 0 . 2 - (cid:2) m beads with that of 0 . 35 - and 0 . 5 - (cid:2) m beads in crude extract demonstrates that size does inﬂuence path trajectory and that curvature increases monotonically with decreasing size ( Figure 3C ) . The path curvatures of bacteria and 0 . 5 - (cid:2) m beads were very similar in the short term ( over (cid:2) 10 (cid:2) m ) , which is not surprising because they have similar diameters . But over the long term , bacteria had a greater persistence , presumably due to their ellipsoidal shape and / or the sheath of actin that wraps around them . The high degree of curvature found in the paths of small beads suggests that they are more subject either to the whims of the actin ﬁlaments guiding them or to heterogeneity in the environment than are larger beads . Increased Viscosity or Addition of Skeletal Muscle Actin Increases Propensity to Turn Dilution of extract affects path curvature as well , but only slightly : over short distances , beads moving in 20 , 40 , or 100 % extract have very similar path curvatures , although over longer distances 0 . 5 - (cid:2) m beads in extract diluted to 40 % follow straighter paths than beads in 100 % extract ( Figure 3D ) . The path curvature of bacteria slightly increased with dilution of the extract ( Figure 3E ) . To determine whether the differences in path curvature with respect to extract dilution results from altered viscosity or altered host cell protein concentrations , we analyzed path curvature of 0 . 5 - (cid:2) m beads moving in diluted extract with 0 . 2 % methylcellulose ( which generates an extract viscosity equivalent to crude extract ) . One might expect that path curvature in diluted extracts with 0 . 2 % methylcellulose would be similar to that in 100 % extract . However , adding methylcellulose to increase viscosity resulted in a massive increase in curvature of bead trajectories ( Figure 3D ) . Sur - prisingly , adding back monomeric rabbit skeletal muscle actin to diluted extract also caused a decrease in path per - sistence and more turns ( Figure 3F ) . However , adding up to 2 . 4 (cid:2) M additional human platelet actin does not alter cur - vature . Thus , the effects on path curvature due to extract dilution cannot be due directly to a predictable decrease in viscosity , and skeletal muscle actin has an anomalous dele - terious effect on path persistence just as it did with speed . In contrast to all other biophysical parameters characterized , average ActA surface density changes had only modest effects on path curvature ( Figure 3G ) . Particle Surface Heterogeneities Do Not Inﬂuence Path Curvature One possible explanation for path curvature is that a there is a persistent , asymmetric heterogeneity on the particle sur - face ( such as varied ActA surface density ) that causes more force to be produced on one side of the particle than on the other and thus a persistent , slightly faster speed for one side , resulting in a curved path ( Rutenberg and Grant , 2001 ) . If the particle rotates around its long axis during forward movement , an S - shaped or random - walk trajectory might result from this persistent surface heterogeneity . To test this hypothesis , we coupled very small ( 50 nm in diameter ) , ﬂuorescent marker beads to the L . monocytogenes surface and examined the relationship between the marker bead position and local bacterial path curvature . The marker bead acts as a ﬁxed reference point on the cell surface . If the surface of one side of the bacterium is more likely to promote turning , then one would expect to ﬁnd turns consistently associated with a similar position of the marker bead with respect to the bacterial long axis . For example , a marker bead that always seems on the “outside” of a curved path as a bacte - rium’s path changes curvature from clockwise to counter - clockwise would be associated with a position on the bacte - rial surface that causes persistently faster actin ﬁlament growth than the position on the opposite side . We calculated the shortest distance ( orthogonal projection ) from the marker bead to the longitudinal axis of the bacterium . This was done for each 10 - s interval of 27 L . monocytogenes tra - jectories , all at least 500 s in length . We then examined whether each marker bead was consistently on the outside or inside of the curve . Any bacterium whose marker bead was consistently in the same region when it turned in a particular direction would exhibit a probability signiﬁcantly greater or less than 0 . 50 . None met this criterion ( population average (cid:6) 0 . 51 , SD (cid:6) 0 . 08 ) . As a further test for a statistically Table 2 .

( D ) Extract viscosity inﬂuences cur - vature : 0 . 5 - (cid:2) m beads coated with 37 . 5 % ActA moving in 20 % extract ( dash ) , 40 % extract ( open circle ) , 40 % extract with methyl cellulose ( ﬁlled circle ) , or 100 % extract ( open diamond ) . ( E ) L . monocytogenes make sharper turns in more dilute extract : bacteria moving in 25 % extract ( dash ) , 50 % extract ( ﬁlled diamond ) , or 100 % extract ( open circle ) .

( G ) Greater ActA surface density on 0 . 5 (cid:2) m beads results in an increase in the curvature of the path of the moving bead : 25 % ActA ( open square ) , 37 . 5 % ActA ( open diamond ) , 50 % ActA ( dash ) , 75 % ActA ( ﬁlled diamond ) , and 100 % ActA ( open circle ) . L . A . Cameron et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2318 signiﬁcant correlation between marker bead position and path curvature , we compared these 27 trajectories to a ran - domized null data set where the measured magnitudes of the orthogonal projections had been randomly reordered with respect to the curvature at that point ( Giardini and Theriot , 2001 ) . The actual data were not signiﬁcantly differ - ent from the randomized trajectories ( average (cid:6) 0 . 51 , SD (cid:6) 0 . 07 , by Student’s t - test , p (cid:3) 0 . 50 ) . Furthermore , careful examination of the length plotted as a function of curvature showed that for all tracks the bead position associated with instantaneous curvatures of the greatest magnitudes could always be revisited during curvatures of the opposite sign . This analysis demonstrates that persistent heterogeneities in the bacterial surface cannot explain curvature variations in L . monocytogenes trajectories . Symmetry - Breaking Increases with Decreased Viscosity Bacteria and beads in cytoplasmic extracts are initially sur - rounded by a uniform , symmetric actin cloud that must break symmetry to form the polarized comet tail ( Cameron et al . , 1999 ; van Oudenaarden and Theriot , 1999 ) , and a similar cloud - to - tail transition is required for movement initiation for bacteria in infected cells ( Tilney and Portnoy , 1989 ) . Both the likelihood and the timing of symmetry - breaking are strongly inﬂuenced by variations in the bio - physical parameters explored in this study . Although the rate of movement of beads in diluted extracts was slower , the total fraction of particles that broke symmetry and formed tails after 20 min increased as the extract became more dilute ( Figure 4A ) . Almost all 0 . 5 - (cid:2) m beads formed tails within 20 min in 20 % extract , with a monotonically decreasing likelihood of symmetry - breaking in more con - centrated extracts ( Figure 4A ) . Similar results were found for a range of smaller bead sizes ( 0 . 2 – 0 . 7 (cid:2) m ) ( Cameron et al . , 2001 ) . The addition of methylcellulose to a ﬁnal concentra - tion of 0 . 2 % in 40 % extract to increase extract viscosity and dampen Brownian motion reduced the efﬁciency of symme - try breaking approximately one - third ( Figure 4B ) , indicating that at least part of the improvement of symmetry - breaking efﬁciency in dilute extracts is simply due to the decrease in viscosity . For smaller beads , the transition from symmetric actin cloud to asymmetric comet tail seemed to be stochastic , and the net likelihood of movement initiation increased as a function of time ( Figure 4 , B and C ) . Twenty minutes after being mixed with diluted extract , less than one - half of the 0 . 5 - (cid:2) m beads formed tails over a range of ActA surface densities , but after 1 h , many more beads initiated motility ( (cid:2) 80 % for beads with a coating of (cid:3) 37 . 5 % ActA ) . Beads in 40 % extract initiated tails more often than beads in full - strength crude extract regardless of the ActA surface density ( Cameron et al . , 1999 for crude extract data ) . At high levels of ActA - coating on beads , surface density had very little effect on motility initiation , but beads with lower surface densities of ActA ( (cid:1) 25 % ) started moving much less frequently in 40 % extract ( Figure 4C ) . However , if given enough time ( 2 . 5 h ) , a large fraction of beads initiated motility , even for the lowest ActA surface densities ( Figure 4C , open triangle ) . This sug - gests that any apparent ActA surface density dependence on efﬁciency of tail formation was actually a time delay in symmetry - breaking . Stepwise Symmetry - Breaking for Large ( 0 . 9 - and 2 - (cid:1) m ) Particles The mechanism of symmetry breaking and tail formation for large particles ( 0 . 9 and 2 (cid:2) m in diameter ) in diluted extracts was observed to be very different from the stochastic mech - Figure 4 . Fraction of beads that form tails increases in diluted extract .

( C ) The fraction of 0 . 5 - (cid:2) m beads , which form tails in 40 % extract increases as a function of percentage of ActA used to coat the beads over time , 20 min ( open diamonds ) , 1 h ( ﬁlled diamonds ) , and 2 . 5 h ( open triangle ) .

Biophysics of Actin - based Motility Vol . 15 , May 2004 2319 anism that has been described here and previously for small particles ( (cid:4) 0 . 5 (cid:2) m in diameter ) . Instead of approaching steady - state over time until a certain fraction of beads formed tails , 0 . 9 - (cid:2) m ( and 2 - (cid:2) m ) beads all gradually went through four morphological transitions : 1 ) symmetric actin cloud , 2 ) asymmetric actin cloud , 3 ) short actin tail , and 4 ) long actin tail generating force to push the bead forward ( Figure 5 ) . The ﬁrst stage , symmetric cloud , was complete by 10 min with the asymmetric clouds forming around approx - imately one - half of the beads by 15 min after the start of the experiment . The process of forming short actin tails occurred for the majority of beads over a period of 30 – 60 min . By 2 h , (cid:3) 95 % of the beads were in their ﬁnal end state with long actin tails . Although virtually 100 % of the large beads went through all four stages of actin tail organization , they were not completely synchronized . At early time points as many as three stages were present with varying percentages de - pending on the particular experiment . Although motility initiation was slower for large particles , the transition from symmetric cloud to asymmetric cloud did not involve as many excursions as are seen with smaller particles ( Cam - eron et al . , 1999 ; van Oudenaarden and Theriot , 1999 ) . In - stead , a cloud on a large bead gradually built asymmetry until the bead began moving away from it in a unidirec - tional manner . These observations are not consistent with a stochastic model for symmetry - breaking ( van Oudenaarden and Theriot , 1999 ) and are more consistent with a model based on gradual accumulation of strain in the growing actin gel ( Noireaux et al . , 2000 ) . Because small beads seem to undergo a stochastic form of symmetry - breaking even in diluted extracts ( Figure 4 ) , and large beads cannot break symmetry at all in concentrated extracts ( Figure 1 and Cam - eron et al . , 1999 ) , we propose that these two different modes of symmetry - breaking represent extremes on a continuum of behaviors that is governed by particle geometry and protein concentration such that strain accumulation can only serve to break symmetry for large objects in dilute protein solu - tions , where actin ﬁlament depolymerization ( which would normally serve to relieve strain in the gel ) is particularly slow . Uniformly Coated Beads Do Not Break Symmetry in Cells The observation that different modes of motility initiation may exist depending on prevailing biophysical parameters raises the question of which case is more similar to condi - tions inside a living cell . To address the factors governing symmetry - breaking in living cell cytoplasm , we devised two independent methods for introducing spherical ActA - coated beads into epithelial MDCK cells expressing GFP - actin ( Rob - bins et al . , 1999 ) . The ﬁrst method used a combination of bacterial virulence factors to mimic natural modes of inva - sion . ActA - coated beads were further derivatized with in - vasin from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis , which induces particle uptake by tight attachment to (cid:5) 1 integrins ( Leong et al . , 1990 ) and with listeriolysin O , an L . monocytogenes gene product that disrupts phagosomal membranes ( Gedde et al . , 2000 ) . The combination of these two bacterial virulence fac - tors has been previously shown to efﬁciently deliver non - pathogenic bacteria into the host cell cytoplasmic compart - ment ( Monack and Theriot , 2001 ) . In the other method , ActA - coated beads were shot into cells by using an air - pressure – driven gene gun . The 0 . 2 - (cid:2) m beads delivered into cell cytoplasm by either method were able to recruit GFP - actin and form clouds with high efﬁciency ( Figure 6 ) . How - ever , under no circumstances were any actin tails ever seen associated with intracytoplasmic beads , and directed move - ment was never observed . Because 0 . 2 - (cid:2) m - diameter beads form comet tails with very high efﬁciency under all extract Figure 5 . Cloud - to - tail transition occurs in distinct steps for 0 . 9 - (cid:2) m beads . All 0 . 9 - (cid:2) m beads form actin tails from actin clouds through a series of steps that seem more distinct than the steps between cloud and tail for smaller beads . ( A ) The actin clouds of three beads are detected using ﬂuorescence microscopy of rhoda - mine - actin . Arrowhead denotes bead with symmetric actin cloud . Two other beads show formation of asymmetric actin clouds . ( B ) After asymmetric clouds form , short little tails form , as seen here . ( C ) Then , slightly longer tails form . ( D ) After 2 h , all beads have formed long actin tails . Bar , 2 (cid:2) m . Figure 6 . The 0 . 2 - (cid:2) m spherical beads fail to break symmetry in living cells .

Molecular Biology of the Cell 2320 conditions , this observation indicates that the viscous , struc - tured environment of living cell cytoplasm , together with the very high turnover rate of actin ﬁlaments in vivo , pre - clude either in vitro mode of symmetry - breaking from tak - ing place and impose an absolute requirement for bacterial surface asymmetry in actin - based motility generated during the course of natural infections . DISCUSSION Polystyrene beads coated with a variety of proteins that activate actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex have be - come widely used as biophysically manipulable artiﬁcial cargo for the study of force generation by actin polymeriza - tion . In this work , we have chosen a motility medium of biochemically complex cytoplasmic extract and performed a series of systematic comparisons , including altering particle size , surface density of protein coating , extract dilution , and extract viscosity to explore a range of parameters and quan - titatively analyze biophysical aspects of actin - based motility . We have found some areas of agreement with several recent reports describing similar systematic studies on movement of polystyrene beads coated with various Arp2 / 3 activators in a mixture of puriﬁed proteins ( Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ; Wiesner et al . , 2003 ; Samarin et al . , 2003 ) , but several areas of striking dissimilarity as detailed below . Factors Governing Speed No reconstituted motility system is yet capable of replicating the extremely rapid speed of bacteria moving inside infected cells ( up to 1 . 4 (cid:2) m / s ; Dabiri et al . , 1990 ) , although generally bacterial speeds in cytoplasmic extracts ( (cid:2) 0 . 14 (cid:2) m / s ; Table 1 ) are faster than speeds in puriﬁed protein systems ( 0 . 04 (cid:2) m / s ; Loisel et al . , 1999 ) . Changes in particle size have a major effect on speed for ActA - coated beads in cytoplasmic extract ( Figure 1B ) . The optimal size for ActA - coated bead movement in X . laevis egg extract is 0 . 5 (cid:2) m in diameter , as speed decreases for larger and smaller beads ( diameter range 0 . 2 – 2 (cid:2) m ) , and speeds of 0 . 5 - (cid:2) m beads closely ap - proximate the speeds of live bacteria under several condi - tions ( Table 1 and Figure 2A ) . A reduced rate of motility with increasing bead diameter was also found for VCA - coated beads ( 1 – 10 (cid:2) m ) moving in the puriﬁed protein system ( Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ) . Both the amount and size dependence of the speed decrease is consistent for the two different systems . Because changes in hydrodynamic drag are calculated to have a negligible effect , it is likely that the effect of particle size on speed is due either to curvature - dependent changes in the rate of accumulation of strain in the actin gel growing at the bead surface ( Noireaux et al . , 2000 ) or to the increased retarding force due to attachment of actin ﬁlaments over a larger surface area ( Mogilner and Oster , 2003 ) . But , experiments using full length N - WASP on beads in the puriﬁed protein system showed no signiﬁcant effect on speed due to varying bead diameter ( 0 . 2 – 3 (cid:2) m ; Wiesner et al . , 2003 ) ; it is not clear why N - WASP – coated beads should behave abnormally with respect to this funda - mental biophysical parameter . Why beads (cid:1) 0 . 5 (cid:2) m in di - ameter move slower is also unclear ; perhaps a smaller num - ber of working ﬁlaments interacting with less overall surface area of a smaller bead leads to slower movement ( Mogilner and Oster , 2003 ) . The rate of movement of ActA - coated beads also de - creases when the crude X . laevis egg extract is diluted ( Fig - ure 2A ) . It is likely that dilution decreases speed simply by decreasing the concentration of proteins essential to motil - ity , because lowering the concentration any of several spe - ciﬁc factors can decrease speed in a puriﬁed protein system ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) , and speed is not restored ( but instead further decreased ) by reconstituting the extract viscosity by addition of methylcellulose ( Figure 2A ) . Addition of rabbit skeletal muscle actin to diluted extracts had the paradoxical effect of slowing movement further ; however , addition of nonmuscle platelet actin caused an increase in speed ( Figure 2B ) . The differences observed between platelet and skeletal muscle actin are signiﬁcant and need to be considered in future work , particularly in light of the fact that skeletal muscle actin is commonly used in puriﬁed protein systems for reconstitution of this form of actin - based motility ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ; Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ; Samarin et al . , 2003 ; Wiesner et al . , 2003 ) . In contrast to the signiﬁcant effects of changing concentrations of soluble factors , changing the surface density of the protein attached to the polystyrene bead has no effect ( ActA ) or only a modest effect ( N - WASP ) on particle speed ( Cameron et al . , 1999 ; Wiesner et al . , 2003 ) . In this respect , both the puriﬁed protein system and cyto - plasmic extracts seem to faithfully reﬂect the relative impor - tance of concentrations of both bacterial surface factors and host cell factors on speed determination in infected cells . The large variation of average speed among individuals is a striking characteristic of bacterial movement in infected host cells ( Sanger et al . , 1992 ; Theriot et al . , 1992 ; Geese et al . , 2000 ; Kuo and McGrath , 2000 ; Lacayo and Theriot , 2004 ) and in cytoplasmic extracts ( Theriot et al . , 1994 ; McGrath et al . , 2003 ) , whereas individual variability is reported to be sig - niﬁcantly suppressed in mixtures of puriﬁed proteins ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ; Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ) . In this study , we have found that in all cases the variation of speed within the trajectory of any individual particle is much less than the variation from particle to particle , suggesting that a persis - tent alteration of the particle surface is responsible for vary - ing the speed set - point . The biochemical factors responsible for set - point determination are apparently not represented in the puriﬁed protein systems and remain to be identiﬁed . Factors Governing Symmetry - Breaking Polystyrene beads uniformly coated with an Arp2 / 3 activat - ing protein initially assemble a uniform spherical actin cloud in both cytoplasmic extracts ( Cameron et al . , 1999 ) and pu - riﬁed protein systems ( Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ; Samarin et al . , 2003 ; Wiesner et al . , 2003 ) , and this initial symmetry must be broken for a motile comet tail to form . Two models have been proposed for the mechanism of symmetry - breaking , cooperative ampliﬁcation of small local variations in actin ﬁlament growth ( van Oudenaarden and Theriot , 1999 ) or gradual accumulation of strain in the grow - ing actin gel followed by a rupture event ( Noireaux et al . , 2000 ; Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ) . The strain accumu - lation model is well supported by observations in the puri - ﬁed protein system ( Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ) but cannot be reconciled with observations in concentrated cy - toplasmic extracts ( Cameron et al . , 1999 , 2001 ) . For example , nearly 100 % of beads in a puriﬁed protein system form tails , and movement initiation occurs at approximately the same time for all particles under a particular condition , as ex - pected under strain accumulation ( Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ) . In contrast , the fraction of moving beads in con - centrated extracts increases slowly over time , and the frac - tion of moving beads approaches (cid:3) 90 % only for the most favorable conditions , with other conditions reaching a lower steady state , both of which are more consistent with a sto - chastic model for symmetry - breaking . Very large beads ( up to 10 (cid:2) m in diameter ) can break symmetry in the puriﬁed Biophysics of Actin - based Motility Vol . 15 , May 2004 2321 protein system , whereas only small ( (cid:1) 0 . 5 - (cid:2) m beads ) can do so in concentrated extracts . Here , we have found that extract diluted to 20 % is in some respects more similar to the puriﬁed protein system than to crude extract ; for example all 2 - (cid:2) m beads in extract diluted to 20 % eventually formed tails . It seems likely that the system undergoes a transition from a stochastic mode of symmetry breaking , which depends on thermal motion and actin cooperativity ( van Oudenaarden and Theriot , 1999 ) , to a strain accumulation mode , in which an actin gel slowly develops increased stress ( Noireaux et al . , 2000 ; Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ) , by increasing the bead size and diluting the extract . The most important variable governing the transition from a stochastic mode to a strain accumula - tion mode is probably the turnover rate of the actin ﬁla - ments . In crude extracts , the average half - life for actin ﬁla - ments in the tail is only (cid:2) 42 s ( Theriot et al . , 1994 ) , precluding any signiﬁcant strain accumulation in the actin cloud , whereas depolymerization is severely compromised in the puriﬁed protein systems ( Samarin et al . , 2003 ) , and we also noticed a slower depolymerization rate in 20 % extracts , because motile beads produced longer tails even though they were moving more slowly ( Figure 5 ) . Strikingly , actin ﬁlament turnover in cells is even faster than in concentrated cytoplasmic extracts ( Theriot et al . , 1992 ) , and even very small ( 0 . 2 - (cid:2) m - diameter beads ) introduced into live cells can - not break symmetry at all ( Figure 6 ) . In this respect , the puriﬁed protein system and very dilute extracts are not at all representative of physiological conditions within a living cell , although the observations of strain accumulation and rupture do reveal interesting physical capabilities of the actin gel system . Factors Governing Path Curvature In contrast to speed and symmetry - breaking , the physical and biochemical factors determining curvature of the parti - cle trajectories have received relatively little experimental or theoretical attention ( Auerbuch et al . , 2003 ) . We have found that the curvature of the trajectory that a bead follows is strongly inﬂuenced by its size and by the surrounding en - vironment . Of the various biophysical parameters that we have tested , particle size has the strongest effect on trajectory curvature , with smaller particles following more sharply curved paths . Similar results were found for VCA - coated beads moving in a mixture of puriﬁed proteins ( Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ) . In most cases , dilution of extract resulted in greater path curvature . But , surprisingly , diluted extract that was restored to the viscosity of crude extract with 0 . 2 % methylcellulose displayed the greatest curvature of any extract concentration . Bacteria also made more fre - quent turns as extract was diluted , similar to results from studies in cells where bacteria are more likely to turn as viscosity decreases due to removal of intermediate ﬁlaments ( Giardini and Theriot , 2001 ) . The bacterial surface or the density of ActA at the surface of a bead does not have much ( if any ) effect on the tendency of the trajectory to curve . The physical basis of trajectory curvature remains to be elucidated . It has been suggested that curvature might result from one side of a particle consistently generating actin gel growth at a slightly faster rate than the other side ( Ruten - berg and Grant , 2001 ) . We have ruled out this explanation by marking speciﬁc sites on the surface of the bacteria and determining that curvature is uncorrelated with location on the surface . Instead , we favor the possibility that persistent curvature is due to the autocatalytic nature of actin gel growth ( Carlsson , 2001 , 2003 ; Rutenberg and Grant , 2001 ) , such that local variations in actin gel growth rate from the outside of the curve to the inside of the curve are correlated with recent history of that part of the gel but are not corre - lated with the properties of the particle surface . The unex - pected effect of methylcellulose on path curvature may be due to a form of autocatalytic path determination , where the tendency of methylcellulose to cause the collapse of actin ﬁlaments into bundles ( Wiesner et al . , 2003 ) may locally alter tail structure in a persistent manner . Concentrated cytoplasmic extracts represent a system with biological complexity intermediate between completely deﬁned mixtures of puriﬁed proteins and intact living cells . Although actin - based movement of bacteria ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) , ActA coated beads ( Boujemaa - Paterski et al . , 2001 ; Samarin et al . , 2003 ) , and N - WASP ( or its Arp2 / 3 activator domain VCA ) - coated beads ( Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ; Wiesner et al . , 2003 ) can be reconstituted with puriﬁed proteins , there are several signiﬁcant differences in motility from that in cells and cytoplasmic extracts . This suggests that there are other cellular factors not included that are important for certain aspects of actin - based motility , most notably enhanced speed , persistent individual variation in speed set - point , and a nonstrain mode of symmetry - break - ing . Complete understanding of the physical factors that inﬂuence this form of actin - based motility under realistic biological conditions will require further systematic , quan - titative experiments in living cells .
