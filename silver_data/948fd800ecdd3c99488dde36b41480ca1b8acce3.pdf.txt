In this manuscript , we summarize the developments in PRIDE resources and related tools since the previous update manuscript was published in Nucleic Acids Research in 2016 . In the last 3 years , public data sharing through PRIDE ( as part of PX ) has deﬁnitely become the norm in the ﬁeld . In parallel , data re - use of public proteomics data has increased enormously , with multiple applications . We ﬁrst describe the new architecture of PRIDE Archive , the archival compo - nent of PRIDE . PRIDE Archive and the related data submission framework have been further developed to support the increase in submitted data volumes and additional data types . A new scalable and fault tolerant storage backend , Application Programming Interface and web interface have been implemented , as a part of an ongoing process . Additionally , we em - phasize the improved support for quantitative pro - teomics data through the mzTab format . At last , we outline key statistics on the current data contents and volume of downloads , and how PRIDE data are starting to be disseminated to added - value resources including Ensembl , UniProt and Expression Atlas . INTRODUCTION High - throughput mass spectrometry ( MS ) - based pro - teomics approaches have matured significantly in recent years , becoming an increasingly used tool in biological re - search , sometimes together with other ‘omics’ approaches such as genomics and transcriptomics . Similarly , to what happened in those fields , in the last 15 years several pub - lic proteomics repositories and bioinformatics resources have been developed to support proteomics researchers . The PRoteomics IDEntifications ( PRIDE ) database ( https : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / pride / ) was set up in 2004 at the Euro - pean Bioinformatics Institute ( EMBL - EBI , Hinxton , Cam - bridge , UK ) to enable public data deposition of MS pro - teomics data , providing access to the experimental data de - scribed in scientific publications ( 1 ) . Since then , PRIDE ( more concretely its archival component , PRIDE Archive ) has evolved in parallel with the field becoming the largest proteomics data repository worldwide ( 2 ) . Although datasets coming from data - dependent acqui - sition ( DDA ) proteomics approaches represent by far the most abundant type of experiment , PRIDE Archive can * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License ( http : / / creativecommons . org / licenses / by / 4 . 0 / ) , which permits unrestricted reuse , distribution , and reproduction in any medium , provided the original work is properly cited . Nucleic Acids Research , 2019 , Vol . 47 , Database issue D443 store datasets coming from all main proteomics data work - flows ( including Data Independent Acquisition ( DIA ) , MS imaging , and top down proteomics , among others ) . The mandatory data types to be included in each sub - mitted dataset are the raw files ( output files from the mass spectrometers ) and the processed results ( at least peptide / protein identification results , quantification infor - mation is optional ) . Therefore , each dataset in PRIDE Archive can contain heterogeneous data types such as peptide / protein identifications and quantification values , the mass spectra ( peak lists and raw data ) , the searched se - quence databases or spectral libraries , programming scripts and any other technical and / or biological metadata pro - vided by the data submitters . A key development led by PRIDE was the establish - ment of the ProteomeXchange ( PX ) consortium of MS pro - teomics resources ( http : / / www . proteomexchange . org ) ( 3 ) , with the overall aim of standardizing data submission and dissemination of proteomics data worldwide . By Septem - ber 2018 , the following proteomics resources are also part of PX : PeptideAtlas and PASSEL ( PeptideAtlaS SRM Experiment Library ) ( 4 , 5 ) , MassIVE ( http : / / massive . ucsd . edu / ) , jPOSTrepo ( 6 ) , iProx ( http : / / www . iprox . org / ) and Panorama Public ( 7 ) . PRIDE has four major aims : ( i ) support data deposi - tion of proteomics experiments , and perform automatic and manual curation of the related experimental metadata ; ( ii ) implement quality control pipelines and visualization com - ponents to enable the assessment of the data quality ( 8 ) ; ( iii ) promote and facilitate the re - use of public proteomics data ; and at last , ( iv ) disseminate high - quality proteomics evidences to added - value resources , including Ensembl ( 9 ) , UniProt ( 10 ) and Expression Atlas ( 11 ) . In order to facilitate the deposition , visualization and quality assessment of the data , the team has developed over the years a complete framework of open - source soft - ware , including stand - alone tools such as the PX Submis - sion tool and PRIDE Inspector ( 12 ) . In addition , the dif - ferent PRIDE related data pipelines , REST web services ( 13 ) and the web interfaces ( 2 ) have been continuously re - fined . Furthermore , we have developed a number of open source software libraries in Java , including jmzML , jmzI - dentML , jmzReader , jmzTab , ms - data - core - api ( 14 ) and the PIA ( Protein Inference Algorithms ) toolbox ( 15 , 16 ) ( https : / / github . com / PRIDE - Utilities ) , to support handling ( e . g . read and writing ) of the most popular proteomics data stan - dard formats ( e . g . mzML , mzIdentML , mzTab ) developed by the Proteomics Standards Initiative ( PSI ) ( 17 ) . In addi - tion to all the PX resources mentioned above , there are ad - ditional proteomics databases and resources available pro - viding protein expression information , most notably the Global Proteome Machine Database ( GPMDB ) ( 18 ) , the CPTAC ( Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium ) data portal ( 19 ) and ProteomicsDB ( 20 ) . In this manuscript , we will summarize the main PRIDE related developments in the last three years , since the pre - vious Nucleic Acids Research database update manuscript was published ( 2 ) . We will discuss PRIDE Archive in more detail but will also provide updated information about the PRIDE related tools and other ongoing activities . CURRENT STATUS OF PRIDE ARCHIVE AND RE - LATED TOOLS Original submitted datasets by scientists are stored in PRIDE Archive ( http : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / pride / archive / ) . All datasets remain private ( password protected ) by default and are only made publicly available after the related manuscript has been accepted , or when PRIDE is notified to do so by the original submitter . Data in PRIDE Archive can be searched and accessed in four different ways : ( i ) the web in - terface , providing a general overview of each dataset ; ( ii ) the PRIDE Inspector tool ( 12 ) , which can be used for down - loading the submitted data files and to visualize spectrum , peptide and protein information in open formats , including several PSI standards ; ( iii ) the Restful web service ( https : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / pride / ws / archive / ) ( 21 ) ; and ( iv ) a file repos - itory , where both the FTP and Aspera ( https : / / asperasoft . com / ) file transfer protocols can be used to access the files . In addition , all public datasets in PRIDE Archive are available through OmicsDI ( https : / / www . omicsdi . org / ) , an EMBL - EBI resource which integrates public datasets com - ing from different omics technologies ( 22 ) . Figure 1 pro - vides an overview of the PRIDE ecosystem , including the most relevant tools , software libraries and the data dissem - ination into other resources . New PRIDE Archive infrastructure : scaling - up a resource for present - day proteomics experiments The number of datasets submitted to PRIDE has grown very significantly in recent years , in parallel with the size of the experiments , e . g . the number of samples , biological / technical replicates and evidences – – mass spec - tra , Peptide Spectrum Matches ( PSMs ) , peptides and pro - teins . Two different factors , scalability and reliability ( fault - tolerance ) , have guided the development of the new PRIDE Archive distributed architecture ( Supplementary Note 1 ) . Every storage item ( e . g . MongoDB , Solr Indexes ) is now de - ployed in two EMBL - EBI datacenters as shard distributed clusters . This new architecture ensures that if one datacenter is not accessible ( due to e . g . technical maintenance ) , PRIDE Archive is still accessible . Data submission process : improved support for quantification results The data submission process has not substantially changed because the overall PX submission guidelines have re - mained stable ( 23 ) . An updated web tutorial explaining the process is available at http : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / training / online / course / proteomexchange - submissions - pride . The main addition is the support for the standardized tab - delimited mzTab format ( 24 ) to perform ‘Complete’ submissions ( those where peptide / protein identifications and , thanks to this ongoing development , also the corresponding quanti - tative information , can be parsed by the repository , made accessible in the database and linked to the originating mass spectra ) . Therefore , support for mzTab has enabled the deposition of quantitative data into PRIDE Archive for the first time in a standard format that is supported for ‘Complete’ submissions ( Supplementary Note 2 ) . By D444 Nucleic Acids Research , 2019 , Vol . 47 , Database issue Figure 1 . Overview of the PRIDE ecosystem , including the resources ( PRIDE Archive and PRIDE Peptidome , in orange ) , tools ( PRIDE Inspector and PX Submission Tool , in red ) , software libraries ( in black ) , web interface and API ( in green ) and the external resources where PRIDE data are disseminated to ( in purple ) . October 2018 , the Mascot ( 25 ) search engine ( e . g . https : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / pride / archive / projects / PXD009079 ) , the OpenMS framework ( 26 ) ( e . g . https : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / pride / archive / projects / PXD010981 ) and MaxQuant ( 27 ) ( e . g . https : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / pride / archive / projects / PXD011194 ) enable natively the export of quantitative results into mzTab . In order to keep improving the support for quan - tification data , we aim to promote the implementation of mzTab in other popular software tools such as Proteome Discoverer ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . The mzIdentML format remains as the mainstream for - mat for ‘Complete’ submissions and is increasingly sup - ported by search engines and tools ( 14 ) . In case mzTab and / or mzIdentML are not yet supported by the user’s soft - ware of choice , the alternative is to perform a ‘Partial’ sub - mission , which is also the current alternative for data work - flows such as DIA , top - down and MS imaging . In parallel with the ongoing developments in PSI data standard for - mats , all PRIDE - related software libraries ( https : / / github . com / PRIDE - Utilities ) have been continuously developed , making data handling and submission a much more robust process . In this context , we will continue extending our li - braries ( ms - data - core - api and jmzIdentML ) to support the new features included in mzIdentML version 1 . 2 such as MS / MS cross - linking and proteogenomics approaches . The PX submission tool The PX Submission tool ( 3 ) ( available at https : / / github . com / proteomexchange / px - submission - tool ) is a stand - alone tool used by most PRIDE submitters to perform data sub - missions . Some of the recent refinements done in the tool are : ( i ) the integration of the new OLS ( Ontology Lookup Service ) Client and OLS Dialog libraries ( 28 ) , supporting the new version of the OLS , used to annotate datasets us - ing controlled vocabulary terms ; and ( ii ) the addition of a direct feedback system for users to report how the data sub - mission went . PRIDE Inspector toolsuite : reviewing datasets before and af - ter submission to PRIDE Archive The PRIDE Inspector tool ( 12 ) ( available at https : / / github . com / PRIDE - Toolsuite / pride - inspector ) was developed to enable researchers to visualize and perform an initial qual - ity assessment of the data both before and after data sub - missions are performed , once the dataset becomes pub - lic . PRIDE Inspector supports several different experimen - tal open output files , ranging from mass spectra ( mzML , mzXML and the most popular peak lists formats such as mgf , dta , ms2 , pkl and apl ) , identification results ( mzI - dentML , mzTab ) , to quantification data ( mzTab ) . Some re - finements have been implemented in the tool and in the un - derlying software libraries over these last years . The main new feature added recently is the support for reviewers to download private datasets using the much faster Aspera file transfer protocol . This key functionality to facilitate the re - view process is not available via the PRIDE Archive web interface at present . PRIDE web interface and restful API : retrieving public pro - teomics data The PRIDE web interface and Restful API ( 13 ) can be used to retrieve and visualize the data corresponding to all PRIDE datasets . The new PRIDE web interface ( Figure 2 ) provides a powerful mechanism to search and / or filter by several types of metadata information , such as sample Nucleic Acids Research , 2019 , Vol . 47 , Database issue D445 Figure 2 . Screenshots of the new PRIDE Archive web interface . ( A ) The project ( dataset ) page provides a general overview of every submitted dataset . ( B ) The PRIDE Archive search page , where it is possible for users to query PRIDE Archive using keywords and additional properties such as species , tissues and instruments , among others . ( C ) Real - time statistics ( including number of submitted datasets per month , number of submitted datasets per instrument type , etc . ) are now provided . details ( e . g . species , tissue , cell type , etc . ) , instrumentation ( mass spectrometer ) , keywords and other provided annota - tions ( Supplementary Note 3 ) . Using the API , it is possible to programmatically query for and retrieve peptide and pro - tein identifications , dataset and assay specific metadata , and all the originally submitted files . Both components are cur - rently under development and new functionalities are being implemented such as suggestions for similar datasets , auto - complete search capabilities and live data content statistics ( Figure 2 ) . PRIDE Peptidome : high - quality peptide evidence from PRIDE Archive The PSMs reported in PRIDE Archive are quality - filtered using a spectrum clustering approach ( 29 ) . All the identi - fied spectra coming from the public experiments in PRIDE Archive were clustered using the second iteration of the PRIDE Cluster algorithm , called spectra - cluster ( https : / / github . com / spectra - cluster ) ( 30 ) . The results of the clus - tering process are made available through the peptide centric PRIDE Peptidome resource ( formally known as PRIDE Cluster , http : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / pride / cluster / ) , which has a completely new web interface , in line with the new PRIDE Archive one . The corresponding spectral li - braries and spectral archives ( containing only unidenti - fied spectra ) are made available at https : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / pride / cluster / # / libraries and at https : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / pride / cluster / # / results . PRIDE ARCHIVE DATA CONTENT STATISTICS By 1 September 2018 , PRIDE Archive contained 10100 datasets ( compared to 3336 datasets on September 2015 ) , of which roughly 19 % are ‘Complete’ ( 1975 datasets ) , 72 % are ‘Partial’ ( 7295 ) and the remaining 9 % ( 830 ) correspond to old ‘legacy’ datasets submitted before the PX data work - flow was implemented . Figure 3A shows the evolution in the number of submitted datasets per month . By September 2018 , an average of 274 datasets were submitted per month during 2018 , amounting to more than 2 - fold when com - pared with 3 years ago . The landmark dataset PXD010000 was submitted on 1 June 2018 . These figures correspond to all datasets including private ones ( non - released , password protected ) . By 1 September 2018 , 56 % ( 5719 ) of the datasets were publicly available . Interestingly , the number of submit - ted datasets generated using experimental approaches other than DDA is growing ( Figure 3B ) . By September 2018 , the number of datasets classified as DDA in PRIDE was 91 % , while 26 % was classified as other types ( Figure 3B ) . The number of DIA and selected reaction monitoring ( SRM ) D446 Nucleic Acids Research , 2019 , Vol . 47 , Database issue A B Figure 3 . ( A ) Number of submitted datasets to PRIDE per month ( from beginning of 2004 till September 2018 ) . ( B ) Number of submitted datasets per experimental approach per year ( from 2014 till September 2018 ) . datasets are indeed the most abundant ones behind DDA datasets . The most represented species ( including both public and private datasets ) are human ( 4335 datasets ) and some of the main model organisms , most notably mouse ( 1432 ) , Arabidopsis thaliana ( 375 ) , Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( 341 ) , rat ( 300 ) , Escherichia coli ( 247 ) , cow ( 112 ) , Drosophila melanogaster ( 101 ) , chicken ( 65 ) , rice ( 70 ) and soybean ( 49 ) . Overall , datasets coming from more than 1840 different tax - onomy identifiers are stored in PRIDE Archive ( Figure 4 ) . These statistics represent in our view a fair reflection of the current guidelines for mandatory data deposition developed by many funding agencies and some scientific journals . At the time of writing , the Wellcome Trust , BBSRC , MRC and the NIH , among other funders , mandate or strongly en - courage open access to research data including proteomics . Additionally , two of the most prominent proteomics jour - nals ( Molecular and Cellular Proteomics and Journal of Pro - teome Research ) and journals from the Nature group now mandate submission of at least the raw data supporting each proteomics publication . Other journals already recommend or strongly recommend data submission ( e . g . Proteomics ( Wiley ) , Journal of Proteomics ( Elsevier ) , PLOS journals , etc . ) . The evolution in the percentage of research articles supported by PRIDE datasets ( in three different proteomics journals : Molecular and Cellular Proteomics , Journal of Pro - teome Research and Proteomics ) is explained in Supplemen - tary Note 4 . At last , in this context , it is important to high - light that the Human Proteome Project has developed for - mal guidelines mandating data submission for all generated datasets ( 31 ) . DATA RE - USE OF PUBLIC PRIDE DATASETS Proteomics researchers are increasingly re - using public data available in PRIDE ( and other resources ) for a broad range of purposes . We came up with four categories of public pro - teomics data re - use : ( i ) use , ( ii ) re - use , ( iii ) reprocess and ( iv ) repurpose ( 32 ) . A simple example of the direct use of data are given by connecting information between proteomics data resources and other resources such as UniProt and Ensembl ( 10 ) . In the case of re - use , public data are re - used in novel experiments with the potential of generating new knowl - edge . Data from a large number of independent datasets can be analyzed or re - used in combination ( a so - called meta - analysis study ) , to extract new knowledge not accessible from any individual dataset . In the case of reprocess , pub - lic datasets are re - analyzed to provide an updated or inte - grated view on the results , as protein sequence databases and software tools evolve . At last , repurposing includes all those cases where the data are considered in a context that is different to that of the original experiment . Two popu - lar applications are proteogenomics approaches ( for human and the main model organisms , e . g . ( 33 , 34 ) ) , and the discov - Nucleic Acids Research , 2019 , Vol . 47 , Database issue D447 Figure 4 . Number of submitted datasets to PRIDE Archive per taxonomy identifier . ery of novel PTMs ( Post - Translational Modifications ) . Re - cent reviews in re - use of public proteomics data are available ( 32 , 35 ) . To corroborate the increase in data re - use , Figure 5 shows the increase in the volume of PRIDE data downloads per year , reaching 296 TBs during 2017 . In addition , using the previously mentioned resource OmicsDI , it is now possible to trace the number of re - analyses of PRIDE datasets per - formed by PeptideAtlas and GPMDB and the number of di - rect citations of PRIDE datasets in the literature ( BioRxiv : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 282517 ) . By September 2018 , 293 datasets had been re - analyzed and 381 dataset identifiers had been cited directly in the literature . PRIDE Proteogenomics : representing peptide sequences into Ensembl using ‘TrackHubs’ The PRIDE and Ensembl teams have been working to - gether to improve the integration of proteomics data in a genome context . Peptide evidence from ‘complete’ public datasets in PRIDE Archive are first quality - filtered ( at a 1 % peptide false discovery rate ) using a framework that uses PIA ( 15 ) . Reliable peptide sequences ( including PTMs ) are mapped to the corresponding genomic coordinates from a given Ensembl release using the PoGo tool ( 36 ) . The re - sulting data for each individual dataset is then combined and made available through the Ensembl ‘TrackHub’ reg - istry , using the popular BED format . In addition to in - dividual datasets , PRIDE Cluster data ( now re - named to PRIDE Peptidome ) is also made available as independent ’TrackHubs’ . At the time of writing , 184 PRIDE pub - lic datasets have been already made available in the En - sembl ‘TrackHub’ registry ( https : / / www . trackhubregistry . org / ) : 163 human , 15 from Mus musculus , 4 from Rattus norvegicus and 2 from Bos taurus . The ‘TrackHubs’ can be searched in the ‘TrackHub’ registry by project identi - fier , taxonomy and / or specific keywords available in the de - scription of the corresponding PRIDE dataset . As a key point , ‘TrackHubs’ can be loaded and visualized in the En - sembl web interface together with other genomic features ( Figure 6 ) . More than 4 million peptide sequences ( 1 . 2 mil - lion of them containing PTMs ) have been mapped to the human genome ( GRCh38 ) . We are working in including data coming from other model organisms . It is very im - portant to highlight that the developed framework sup - ports the other two major genome browsers : The UCSC Genome Browser and IGV ( Integrative Genomics Viewer ) . All data can be downloaded from http : / / ftp . pride . ebi . ac . uk / pride / data / proteogenomics / latest / archive / , for downstream analysis . Moving data into Expression Atlas : re - analysis of quantita - tive datasets At the time of writing , 15 quantitative proteomics datasets have already been integrated into the Expression Atlas , an EMBL - EBI added value database that provides in - formation about gene and protein expression in different species and contexts ( 11 ) . All PRIDE integrated proteomics datasets were manually curated and re - analyzed using a MaxQuant based pipeline . By September 2018 , five mouse datasets ( showcasing a complete proteome , e . g . https : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / gxa / experiments / E - PROT - 16 / Results ) , six datasets coming from cancer cell lines ( showcasing the inte - gration between proteomics and transcriptomics data ) and four datasets coming from clinical tumor samples had al - ready been integrated in Expression Atlas . From Expression Atlas , in the near future , we plan that relevant quantitative proteomics data will be disseminated into the Open Targets platform ( 37 ) .

DISCUSSION AND FUTURE PLANS Thanks , among other efforts , to the success of PRIDE ( and of the PX consortium as a whole ) , the proteomics commu - nity is now widely embracing open data policies , an oppo - site scenario to the situation just a few years ago . In parallel , public proteomics data are being increasingly re - used , with multiple applications . We next outline some of the main working areas for PRIDE in the near future . First of all , a key aspect is to improve the annotation of the datasets . The current requirements were set up in 2011 ( minor updates in 2013 ) , during the establishment of PX , reflecting the discussions at the time , involving many key stakeholders in the field . The main priority was to make data sharing popular . Once this has been achieved , it is now the right time to ‘raise the bar’ . At the time of writing , a novel annotation system is under development ( Supplemen - tary Note 2 ) . The aim is to improve the capture of the ex - perimental design information and technical metadata ( e . g . search parameters and relevant information contained in the raw files ) ( 28 , 38 ) . The improvement in annotation is also required to facilitate further data re - use for third parties . Another key aspect in making data re - use easier is to bring the analysis tools closer to the data , as datasets keep increas - ing in size . We are already working in developing open and repro - ducible data analysis pipelines of different flavours of pro - teomics workflows ( e . g . DDA , DIA , proteogenomics ) . The main rationale is to make possible the use of that soft - ware in cloud infrastructures ( using the EMBL - EBI cloud as the starting point ) , so that in the future the pipelines can be used by the community in the cloud using software container technologies ( 39 , 40 ) . In addition , we aim to in - creasingly perform internal data re - use ( including data re - processing ) and disseminate high - quality proteomics data Nucleic Acids Research , 2019 , Vol . 47 , Database issue D449 from PRIDE into the already mentioned added - value re - sources ( Ensembl , UniProt and Expression Atlas ) , among others . At present , identified proteins in PRIDE ‘Complete’ datasets are cross - referenced in the corresponding UniProt entries ( e . g . https : / / www . uniprot . org / uniprot / Q12181 ) and ‘TrackHubs’ are published for some ‘Complete’ datasets in Ensembl . We plan to enable a more detailed annotation of UniProt and Ensembl entries using proteomics evidence coming from PRIDE , focusing on PTMs , sequence variants and quantitative expression information . To support this , integration of re - analyzed datasets and the corresponding results in the PRIDE Archive infras - tructure needs to be properly supported . Another highly relevant topic for the coming years is the management of clinical proteomics data , and whether they should be con - sidered as patient identifiable or not . This topic has re - cently gained more relevance after the introduction of the GDPR ( General Data Protection Regulation ) guidelines by the European Union and we plan to discuss it further in the context of the ELIXIR activities ( https : / / www . elixir - europe . org / ) . In this context , it is important to highlight that in 2017 , PRIDE was named an ELIXIR core data re - source ( https : / / www . elixir - europe . org / platforms / data / core - data - resources ) , joining those biological databases consid - ered to be essential for the scientific community , highlight - ing the need to make them sustainable in the long term ( 41 ) . To finalize , we invite interested parties in PRIDE re - lated developments to follow the PRIDE Twitter account ( @ pride ebi ) . For regular announcements of all the new publicly available datasets , users can follow the PX Twitter account ( @ proteomexchange ) .
