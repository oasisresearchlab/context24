Binding of Bovine Serum Albumin to Heparin Determined by Turbidimetric Titration and Frontal Analysis Continuous Capillary Electrophoresis Toshiaki Hattori , 1 Kozue Kimura , Emek Seyrek , and Paul L . Dubin 2 Department of Chemistry , Indiana University – Purdue University , Indianapolis , Indiana 46202 Received October 23 , 2000 ; published online July 19 , 2001 The association of proteins with glycosaminogly - cans is a subject of growing interest , but few tech - niques exist for elucidating this interaction quantita - tively . Here we demonstrate the application of capillary electrophoresis to the system of serum albu - min ( SA ) and heparin ( Hp ) . These two species form soluble complexes , the interaction increasing with re - duction in pH and / or ionic strength ( I ) . The acid – base property of Hp was characterized by potentiometric titration of ion - exchanged Hp . Conditions for complex formation with SA were qualitatively determined by turbidimetry , which revealed points of incipient bind - ing ( pH c ) and phase separation ( pH f ) , both of which depend on I . At pH > pH f , i . e . , prior to phase separa - tion , frontal analysis continuous capillary electro - phoresis was used to measure the concentration of free protein and to determine the protein – HP binding isotherm . The binding isotherms were well ﬁt by the McGhee – von Hippel model to yield quantitative bind - ing information in the form of intrinsic binding con - stants ( K obs ) and binding site size ( n ) . The strong in - crease in K obs with decrease of pH or I could be explained on the basis of electrostatic interactions , considering the effects of protein charge heterogene - ity . The value of n , independent of pH , was rational - ized on the basis of size considerations . The implica - tions of these ﬁndings for clinical applications of Hp and for its physiological behavior are discussed . © 2001 Academic Press The binding of proteins to proteoglycans ( PGs ) 3 is an important biological phenomenon . For example , the interaction between chondroitin sulfate or keratan sul - fate proteoglycans and collagen ﬁbrils in the cartilage matrix deﬁnes the ﬁnal shape of the tissue and pro - vides the ability to withstand compressive load ( 1 ) . Heparan sulfate proteoglycans ( HSPGs ) interact with ﬁbronectin – collagen complexes in plasma membranes to assist cell adhesion ( 1 ) . HSPGs in the glomerular basement membrane ( GBM ) also provide selective ﬁl - tration of proteins ( 1 , 2 ) . These interactions appear to have a strong electrostatic component , arising from the interactions between charges on the proteins and the intense negative charge on glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs ) in PGs . GAGs are highly diversiﬁed sulfated and carboxy - lated linear polysaccharides that constitute the major components of PGs . The backbone of the extracellular matrix PG aggregate is a high - molecular - weight ( ca . 2 3 10 6 ) hyaluronic acid , to which are bound a large number of core proteins ; each core protein , in turn , is covalently bound to numerous GAGs ( 3 – 5 ) . Many of the roles of PGs in extracellular signaling appear to de - pend on the interaction between GAGs and other mac - romolecules , in particular proteins ( 3 , 6 ) . Conse - quently , the study of GAG – protein interactions can facilitate a physical understanding of important biolog - ical phenomena . Many techniques have been used to investigate the interaction between GAGs and proteins . For example , the formation of complexes has been detected using ﬂuorescence ( 7 , 8 ) and UV ( 8 ) absorption .

Protein structural changes as a result of complexation between GAGs and proteins have been observed by circular dichroism measurement ( CD ) ( 11 , 12 ) and NMR ( 13 ) , and the binding sites of proteins and GAGs have been identi - ﬁed by X - ray crystallography of complexes between proteins and GAG oligomers ( 14 ) . Complex mobilities have been measured by capillary electrophoresis ( CE ) ( 15 ) . Although numerous methods have been used to ex - amine protein – GAG complexes , few techniques are ca - pable of quantitatively determining an important vari - able : the GAG – protein complex formation constant . These potentiometric , spectroscopic , or chromato - graphic methods all pose respective difﬁculties . For example , the heparin ( Hp ) – protamine binding constant was determined using a Hp - sensitive electrode after neutralization of the complex ( 16 ) , but the mechanism of this electrode response is not well understood , and other bulky anions e . g . , free proteins of negative net charge , can act as interferents in this assay . Quantita - tion of complexation has been carried out using ﬂuo - rescence ( 17 – 19 ) , but this approach depends on a large change in absorption before and after complexation . While afﬁnity chromatography has been used to mea - sure the dissociation constant ( 20 ) , large amounts of sample are required and the dissociation constant can be perturbed by the immobilization of protein or GAG . Frontal analysis continuous capillary electro - phoresis ( FACCE ) ( 21 ) is a new technique that has been demonstrated as a way to obtain precise and reliable binding data for protein – polyelectrolyte complexes . This technique resembles other capillary electrophoresis methods , namely the Hummel – Dreyer method , conventional frontal analysis method , afﬁnity capillary electrophoresis , and va - cancy peak and vacancy afﬁnity capillary electro - phoresis ; however , each of these measurements of quantitative binding parameters poses some prob - lems ( 22 ) . Because the perturbation of the binding equilibria intrinsic to conventional frontal analysis method is overcome by continuous sampling , FACCE can be performed even when the mobility of the complex is not equal to the mobility of ligand or acceptor . Afﬁnity capillary electrophoresis is useful for determining the dissociation constant of pro - tein – Hp binding ( 23 – 26 ) , but the resulting constant is not regarded as a true quantitative binding pa - rameter when multiple ligands bind to the acceptor ( 22 ) . On the other hand , FACCE may be used even in multiple complexation equilibria to measure the con - centration of free ligand because its concentration is not determined from mobility ; instead , the peak height directly indicates free ligand concentration . The stoichiometric relationship between bound li - gand and the complex can then be ﬁt to appropriate binding isotherms to yield binding constants and binding site size , two parameters that are very use - ful in elucidation of the binding mechanism . More - over , sample requirements are smaller , and the mea - surement time is short . FACCE thus appears to be a simple , rapid , economical , precise , and reproducible method for quantitative characterization of protein – polyelectrolyte binding . Previous studies with FACCE focused on combina - tions of proteins and synthetic polyelectrolytes ( 21 ) . Here we are interested in developing FACCE method - ology for combinations of proteins and biological poly - electrolytes . While the ultimate goal is to apply this technique to physiological cognates , our purpose here is to develop the methodology , as opposed to addressing a speciﬁc biochemical question . To do this , we have chosen bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) as the protein and heparin ( Hp ) as the biological polyelectrolyte . The interaction of Hp and Hp - like GAGs with pro - teins is clearly of considerable interest . Hp – protein interactions regulate biological processes as diverse as complement activation , coagulation , cell adhe - sion , angiogenesis , platelet aggregation , lipolysis , and smooth muscle proliferation . Hp regulates an - giogenesis , the growth of new capillary blood vessels , by interacting with peptide growth factors ( 27 ) . It has an anticoagulant effect in coagulation , where binding to a plasma Hp cofactor is required for its activity ( 28 ) ; consequently , Hp is often used during surgical procedures or as an anticoagulant for thrombosis . Hp also has a direct aggregatory effect on platelets and lipoproteins ; the interaction with the platelets causes platelet proaggregating and po - tentiating effects ( 29 ) , while the binding of Hp to lipoprotein leads to aggregation or fusion of the lipo - protein during lipolysis ( 30 ) . Hp is also responsible for the antiproliferative activity in smooth muscle proliferation ( 31 ) . While these diverse and complex biological roles are not fully understood , they clearly involve the binding of many proteins . Serum albumin is not a biochemical cognate of Hp , but it is the most abundant protein in the body and in particular is present at high concentration for intrave - nously administered Hp . Because the molecular weight of serum albumin is large ( even in the absence of mul - timerization ) , complex formation of serum albumin with polymers is easily observed by many methods based on scattering or electrical mobility ( 32 ) . The structure of serum albumin is well understood and its properties , particularly its ionization behavior , are thoroughly documented . Selection of the Hp / albumin pair as a demonstrative model of the quantitation of GAG – protein interactions using FACCE is thus based on numerous considerations . 159 ELECTROPHORETIC DETERMINATION OF SERUM ALBUMIN – HEPARIN BINDING EXPERIMENTAL Materials Heparin ( sodium salt , porcine intestinal mucosa , Lot B27591 ) , nominal M r 13 , 500 – 15 , 000 was from Calbio - chem ( La Jolla , CA ) . BSA ( fatty acid free , Lot 8656224 , M r 68 , 000 ) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim Corp . ( Indianapolis , IN ) . Analytical - grade dibasic so - dium phosphate was obtained from J . T . Baker Chem - ical Co . ( Phillipsburg , NJ ) and monobasic sodium phos - phate was from Mallinckrodt Inc . ( Paris , KY ) . Other chemicals and reagents were obtained from current commercial sources at the highest level of purity avail - able . All buffers and solutions were prepared with Milli - Q water ( Millipore , Milford , MA ) . Potentiometric Titration of Ion - Exchanged Hp Hp was ion - exchanged from the sodium salt to the hydrogen form using 45 ml of Dowex 50W - X8 ( cation exchange resin ; 5 . 1 meq / dry gram , 1 . 8 meq / ml resin bed ) in a 50 - ml buret column . A 10 - ml solution contain - ing 0 . 05 g of heparin sodium salt was poured into the column and washed through with Milli - Q water . After 10 ml of void volume was removed , at least 50 ml of solution was recovered . Collection of larger volumes did not increase the amount of measurable acid , prov - ing that all the Hp was collected . The ion - exchanged Hp solution was titrated with 0 . 5 M NaOH using a Corning pH meter 240 with a FUTURA reﬁllable com - bination pH electrode ( Beckman , Fullerton , CA ) . Turbidimetric Titration Turbidity measurements , reported as 100 - % T , were performed at 420 nm using a Brinkman PC800 probe colorimeter equipped with a 1 - cm path - length ﬁber optics probe . Turbidimetric titrations were carried out by adding 0 . 5 N HCl to mixed solutions of BSA ( 1 g / L ) and Hp ( 0 . 1 g / L ) containing variable concentrations of NaCl ( 0 . 01 , 0 . 02 , 0 . 05 , 0 . 1 , or 0 . 2 M NaCl ) . All titra - tions were carried out with gentle magnetic stirring , and the observed pH and transmittance were deter - mined after the values had been stable for at least 1 min . The measured values were corrected by subtract - ing the turbidity of a Hp - free blank . Frontal Analysis Continuous Capillary Electrophoresis Capillary electrophoresis was performed using a P / ACE 5500 CE ( Beckman , Fullerton , CA ) with UV detector , operating at 8 kV and 25°C . The fused silica capillary ( Polymicro Technologies Inc . , Phoenix , AZ ) of dimensions 50 m m 3 27 cm ( effective length 20 cm ) was prepared prior to each set of experiments by washing with 0 . 1 M NaOH for 10 min followed by a 10 - min wash with Milli - Q water . This ensured a negative capillary surface charge under the experi - mental conditions . Sample solutions were made from freshly prepared stock solutions of BSA and Hp dissolved in CE run buffer solution . The run buffer solution of I 5 0 . 01 consisted of disodium hydrogen phosphate and sodium dihydrogen phosphate adjusted to pH’s 6 . 5 , 6 . 8 , and 7 . 0 . The concentration range of BSA was 0 . 2 – 8 . 0 g / L and the concentration of Hp was constant at 0 . 2 g / L . The pH values of the samples were always adjusted to same pH as the run buffer . The FACCE ( 21 ) experiment was initialized by equilibrating the capillary with buffer solution for 5 min . The inlet end of the capillary was then placed in a vial containing the equilibrated sample solution , and the outlet end was placed into a vial containing buffer solution . Constant voltage was applied , and separation , manifested in continuous plateaus , was observed . The ﬁrst eluting plateau was the free pro - tein , and the second was the free protein and the protein – Hp complex . Although a multiple peak pat - tern sometimes appeared instead of the second pla - teau , the ﬁrst plateau was always obtained . After each electrophoretic run , a 5 - min wash with 0 . 1 M NaOH followed by a 5 - min rinse with water was performed . The concentration of free protein was determined from the height of ﬁrst plateau , using a calibration curve constructed by measuring the pla - teau height of known concentrations of protein ob - tained under the same experimental conditions as for the protein – Hp mixture . The amount of bound BSA was obtained by subtracting the amount of mea - sured free BSA from the total amount used . Computational Methods Molecular modeling was done using DelPhi v98 . 0 ( Molecular Simulations Inc . ) , where the electrostatic potential in and around the protein is calculated by nonlinear solution of Poisson – Boltzmann equation . The protein was placed in the center of a grid box with its largest dimension occupying 40 % of the grid length . The resolution was set at 101 grid points per axis . The dielectric constants of the solvent and the protein were set to 80 and 2 . 5 , respectively . Using the fractional charges for each charged amino acid residues , the elec - trostatic potential is then calculated at every point inside the grid box . The charges of amino acid residues were determined using as a starting point the simple model put forward by Tanford ( 33 ) . In this spherical - smeared - charge model , the titration curve of a protein is a superposi - tion of the curves for each of the seven groups of amino acids . The fraction a of dissociated groups of any groups is given by 160 HATTORI ET AL . pH 2 log S a 1 2 a D 5 p K int 2 1 2 . 303 kT › W › Z , [ 1 ] where K int is an intrinsic dissociation constant charac - teristic of each group and W is the electrostatic free energy of the protein . All of the charges are considered to be smeared evenly over the surface so that positive and negative charges can cancel and only the average net charge Z # remains . The total electrostatic free en - ergy is then the work of charging the sphere from zero to Z # and the work of charging due to the presence of the surrounding ions and is given by W 5 Z # 2 e 2 2 D S 1 b 2 k 1 1 k a D , [ 2 ] where b is the radius of the sphere , a is the distance of closest approach between the centers of two ions ( i . e . , a 2 b is the dimensions of a salt ion radius ) , k is the Debye – Huckel parameter proportional to the square root of the ionic strength , e is the protonic charge , and D is the dielectric constant of the solvent . With this value of W , Eq . [ 1 ] becomes pH 2 log S a 1 2 a D 5 p K int 2 0 . 868 wZ # [ 3 ] w 5 e 2 2 DkT S 1 b 2 k 1 1 k a D . Equation [ 3 ] has been used extensively and success - fully in the interpretation of potentiometric titrations studies of globular proteins such as ovalbumin , serum albumins , ribonuclease , hemoglobin , and b - lactoglobu - lin ( 34 ) . Electrostatic interactions are thus accounted for by 0 . 868 wZ # , with w being essentially an empirical ﬁtting parameter . Previous titration data of BSA could be well ﬁt by Eq . [ 3 ] using ionic - strength - dependent w values ( 35 ) . Titration curves were thus ﬁrst con - structed using these along with some w values inter - polated with respect to ionic strength , in conjunction with p K int values that represented approximately the mean of literature data ( 35 ) . Then , the p K int value for each group was adjusted in the range of previously found values until the differences between calculated and experimental titration curves were minimized at all ionic strengths . Adjusted p K int values ( see Table 1 ) were then used along with Eq . [ 3 ] to calculate the charges of each ionizable group at the desired pH and I . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Potentiometric Titration of Ion - Exchanged Hp Hp , a polydisperse polysaccharide consisting of sev - eral different disaccharide units , cannot be repre - sented by any single structure ( 36 ) . The contents of sulfate groups and carboxylate groups are thus vari - able and also dependent on the source ( 36 ) . Since we ﬁnd the binding between BSA and Hp to be mainly based upon electrostatic interaction , characterization of the ionic content of Hp is an important parameter which can formally be expressed by an equivalent weight ( mass per unit charge group ) . Figure 1 shows potentiometric titration curves of ion - exchanged Hp in the absence and presence of so - dium chloride . The ﬁrst inﬂection point must be the end point of the strong acid ( sulfate and sulfamido ) groups , and the second inﬂection that of the weak acids ( carboxylate groups ) . The p K a of the latter is elevated by the electrostatic inﬂuence of the strongly ionized groups . Consequently , the disappearance of the ﬁrst TABLE 1 Intrinsic Dissociation Constants of Titratable Groups in BSA Type of group Numberingroup a p K int a Numberingroup b p K int c b , g - Carboxyl 99 4 . 02 98 4 . 1 e - Amino 57 9 . 8 59 10 . 3 Imidazole 16 6 . 9 16 6 . 7 Phenolic 19 10 . 35 18 11 Guanidine 22 . 12 24 12 a - Carboxyl 1 3 . 75 1 3 . 75 a - Amino 1 7 . 75 1 7 . 75 a Values from Ref .

The amount of NaOH con - sumed after the second end point is equivalent to the summation of the strong and weak acidic groups , so the equivalent weight was 5 . 0 meq / g . The relative ratio of carboxylate groups to strong acid groups was obtained as 1 : 2 . 7 . This ratio corresponds to 2 . 7 sulfate and sul - foamido groups per disaccharide , in agreement with a literature value ( 14 ) . The dissociation constant of polycarboxylates such as poly ( acrylic acid ) in general depends on a and I ( 37 ) . Figure 2 shows the apparent dissociation constant , p K a of the carboxylate groups , deﬁned by p K a 5 pH 1 log [ ( 1 2 a ) / a ] , as a function of a and I . In pure water , p K a strongly depends upon a and is larger than the intrinsic p K a ; the value of p K a is 5 . 1 at a 5 0 . 5 , which agrees with the value of 5 . 1 measured by CD and potentiometric titration ( 38 ) . This value is consider - ably larger than the p K a of 3 determined by NMR ( 39 ) . Possible limitations of the NMR method , particularly at concentrations as high as 10 % w / v may be indicated by another report that the p K a strongly decreases with Hp concentration ( 40 ) , despite the fact that p K a ’s of polyacids are generally not reported to show strong concentration dependence . In any event , it is clear that intrinsic properties of polymer chains are best ob - served at high dilution , which can account for the good agreement between our value and the CD result , both measured at about 0 . 1 % w / v . The addition of 1 . 0 M sodium chloride solution causes , as expected , a de - crease in our measured p K a from 5 . 1 to 4 . 3 . This value is higher than p K a 5 3 . 28 of D - glycopyranosyluronic acid ( 45 ) or the intrinsic dissociation constant , p K 0 5 2 . 9 , of hyaluronic acid ( 46 ) , indicating that the inhibi - tion of the dissociation of carboxylate by the high neg - ative charge of the sulfate groups persists even at high salt . Turbidimetric Titration In order to establish appropriate conditions for FACCE , qualitative information about the binding of BSA – Hp is required . For a large protein such as BSA , turbidimetry is sufﬁciently sensitive to detect the sol - uble polyelectrolyte complex and so can be used to deﬁne three pH regions corresponding to no interac - tion , soluble complex , and precipitate or coacervate ( 38 ) . Figure 3 shows the turbidimetric titration curve of the mixture of 1 g / L of BSA and 0 . 1 g / L of Hp in 0 . 03 M NaCl . In region 1 , there is no complexation between BSA and Hp because of the strong coulombic repulsion between the net negatively charged BSA ( p I ’ 4 . 9 ) and the negatively charged Hp . In region 2 , with decreasing negative charge , BSA forms a soluble complex with Hp . However , the soluble complex may form “on the wrong side” of p I ( 39 ) , i . e . , at pH . p I . The abrupt transition from region 1 to region 2 , i . e . , a well - deﬁned “pH c ” for soluble complex formation , can be veriﬁed by dynamic light scattering ( 39 ) . In region 3 , the complex aggre - gates and forms visible precipitate , with an abrupt increase in turbidity at “pH f . ” The dependences of pH c and pH f on I are shown as BSA – Hp “phase bound - aries” in Fig . 4 . Obviously , FACCE can only be done in region 2 . The increase of I strongly depresses pH c since the salt screens electrostatic interactions , necessitat - ing a larger protein positive charge . On the other hand , pH f is independent of I , and this constant value is close to p I ( 38 , 39 ) . FACCE Electropherograms In contrast to conventional frontal analysis , FACCE involves continuous sampling , so the electropherogram FIG . 3 . Turbidimetric titration curve at I 5 0 . 03 , for 1 g / L of BSA with 0 . 1 g / L of heparin . FIG . 2 . The a dependence of the p K a of the carboxylate groups of heparin ( h ) in the absence of NaCl and ( n ) at I 5 1 . 0 M NaCl . 162 HATTORI ET AL . is a step - like separation proﬁle , as shown in Fig . 5 . Since the electrophoretic mobility of the complex is more negative than that of free BSA , the ﬁrst plateau in the electropherogram is due to the elution of free BSA , and the second plateau is due to free BSA and complex . In conventional frontal analysis , the loss of free BSA in the mixture region ( corresponding to sec - ond plateau ) would make the complex decompose into free BSA and free Hp . In FACCE , however , the loss is made up by supplying free protein in the following eluent . The concentration of free BSA is equal and constant in both ﬁrst and second plateaus and there is no perturbation of the binding equilibrium . The con - centration of free BSA in the mixture of BSA and Hp is then determined by calibrating the peak height of ﬁrst plateau . An unexplained spike peak appears for Hp - free BSA , possibly due to limited adsorption of BSA onto the capillary . In order to minimize such adsorption FACCE was carried out only at pH . 6 . 5 . Binding Isotherms Binding isotherms of BSA - Hp at I 5 0 . 01 M and at various pH values are shown in Fig . 6 . Here [ BSA ] free is the concentration of free BSA in the mixture , and v is the number of protein molecules bound per charged group . v is deﬁned in this manner for the following reason . In the case of nonspeciﬁc binding arising from long - range electrostatic forces , the binding site does not correspond to a well - deﬁned portion of the host macromolecule . The corresponding binding site size could be somewhat arbitrarily deﬁned as a number of sugar rings or disaccharides . However , since the bind - ing is primarily electrostatic , we choose here to discuss the size of the apparent binding site in terms of the number of charges it encompasses , a procedure similar to the one used in describing the binding of oligolysines to poly ( rI ) 1 poly ( rU ) ( 43 ) . The relationship of v , the number of BSA bound per Hp charge group , to v * , the number of BSA bound per disaccharide , is simply v * 5 3 . 7 v . The amount of BSA bound depends strongly on the pH . The diminution of the binding with pH must be the result of increased repulsion between Hp and BSA due to the increasing negative charge of BSA . The addition of salt also depresses the amount of BSA bound : even at I 5 0 . 03 , the concentration of BSA bound in pH 6 . 7 buffer solution was too low to obtain a signiﬁcant re - sult . These strong effects of pH and ionic strength indicate that the interaction is mainly due to coulombic forces between Hp and BSA . The binding isotherms were ﬁt to the McGhee – von Hippel ( 45 ) equation FIG . 4 . Phase boundary for BSA ( 1 g / L ) and heparin ( 0 . 1 g / L ) : ( h ) pH c ; ( n ) pH - .

The two binding parameters of K obs and n were obtained by nonlinear curve ﬁtting of v / L vs v , and their values are listed in Table 2 . Although the McGhee – von Hippel ( MvH ) model can be made to en - compass cooperative binding ( 45 ) , the binding iso - therms in the present study were well ﬁt without an additional cooperativity term . As shown by the solid lines in Fig . 6 , the ﬁtted curves conform very well to the experimental points . Similarly good two - parameter binding isotherm ﬁts were reported for the binding between protein and synthetic polymers ( 46 , 47 ) . The intrinsic binding constant decreases strongly with in - creasing pH , while the binding site size expressed in terms of Hp ionic sites is n 5 14 independent of pH . This corresponds to a binding site size of 14 / 3 . 7 disac - charide units , i . e . , an octasaccharide . The binding isotherms in Fig . 6 may be converted into Fig . 7 , which shows the number of BSA bound per disaccharide increasing with added BSA to a limiting value of 0 . 125 . This corresponds to approximately three BSA bound per Hp molecule , based on an M r of 14 , 000 . The limiting value of 0 . 125 indicates that BSA occupies on average 8 disaccharides in Hp , N lim , which is larger than the value N site 5 4 found above ; i . e . , efﬁcient packing in which every octasaccharide site is occupied does not occur . This result is consistent with the MvH “overlapping binding site” model , in which complete saturation of BSA is inhibited by the entropic resistance based on the “parking problem” : the binding possibilities for BSA depend upon the binding site of previously bound BSA . This effect , however , could also arise from the repulsive force between negatively charged neighboring bound proteins ( see below ) lead - ing to anticooperative binding . Analysis of the binding isotherms does not make it possible to distinguish be - tween these two types of anticooperativity . Since reso - lution between these two effects is not possible at the present time , the MvH plots should be recognized as effective empirical ﬁts which , however , should not be interpreted too rigidly . The fact that the MvH model is in principle strictly relevant to chains of inﬁnite length ( 48 ) is a similar reason to avoid strict interpretation of the ﬁtting parameters in terms of the theoretical model . From N site 5 4 and the length per disaccharide of ca . 1 nm ( 49 ) , we can estimate that the contour length of the protein - binding site on Hp is about 4 nm , which is smaller than the Stokes diameter of BSA of ca . 7 nm ( 50 ) . Thus , Hp does not wrap around BSA , but rather binds to some site on the protein , presumably a domain that bears a positive charge ( see below ) . The consis - tency of n as a function of pH suggests constancy of the Hp - binding site of BSA ; on the other hand , we ﬁnd no evidence for a unique protein - binding site on Hp . Computational Model of the Binding Site The binding of a strong polyanion such as Hp to BSA at a pH well above p I indicates the presence of a pos - itive “patch” in an otherwise negatively charged pro - tein ( 44 ) . Computer graphics allows us to identify one or more domains of positive potential , which must be involved in Hp binding by a protein of net negative charge , and also to visualize the implications of some of the results obtained from FACCE . However , if the po - tential was displayed on the protein surface , positive charges appeared in the negative domains and vice versa : no continuous and extensive positive potential domain could be observed . But when the potential was displayed 5 Å away from the van der Waals surface , positive and negative regions could clearly be distin - guished . Figure 8 shows such an image of BSA , from three different views , for the conditions corresponding TABLE 2 Intrinsic Binding Constant and Binding Site Size of BSA – Hp at I 5 0 . 01 M pH log K i n 6 . 5 4 . 12 ( 6 0 . 04 ) 15 . 5 ( 6 0 . 7 ) 6 . 8 3 . 56 ( 6 0 . 02 ) 13 . 9 ( 6 0 . 7 ) 7 . 0 3 . 23 ( 6 0 . 02 ) 13 . 7 ( 6 0 . 9 ) FIG . 7 .

The image in Fig . 8b shows a continuation of the positive potential patch in Fig . 8a . As has been discussed earlier , Hp does not wrap around BSA , so the Hp - binding site is some portion of this patch , corresponding—as discussed above—to a size of about 4 nm , consistent with the view in Fig . 8b . The modest curvature of this site is in accord with the ﬂexibility of the Hp molecules . The side of the protein opposite to the binding side shown in Fig . 8c is strongly negative . Thus , repulsive interactions among bound BSA could lead to anticooperative binding . The binding of Hp to protein cognates has been dis - cussed in terms of speciﬁc amino acid sequences that constitute the Hp - binding site ( s ) ( 14 ) . This description of speciﬁc binding differs fundamentally from loose nonspeciﬁc binding at the 5 - Å surface proposed here for BSA and Hp . In our model multiple conﬁgurations of the Hp chain which approximate the minimum en - ergy state may exist . Whether such a model is tenable for glycosaminoglycan – protein pairs will be the subject of future investigations . Physiological and Clinical Implications The present results may be relevant to some of the clinical applications of Hp , as well as its physiological functions . Hp has been administered as a treatment for albuminuria ( abnormal urinary excretion of albumin ) ( 51 , 52 ) in diabetics . It has been suggested that albu - minuria , which is a loss of ﬁltration selectivity in the glomerular basement membrane GBM , could arise from a diminution of the heparin sulfate proteoglycan content of the GBM ( 53 ) , consequently , albumin - free ﬁltration might be restored if Hp were to somehow ameliorate this loss . Figure 4 shows that physiological blood conditions ( pH 7 . 4 , I 5 0 . 15 M ) correspond to strong repulsive interactions between BSA and Hp , even under acidosis or hyponatremia ( the decrease of sodium concentration in blood ) , and Hp as a component of the GBM should reduce serum albumin ﬁltration . On the other hand , severe reduction of I can lead to attraction ( region 2 or 3 in Fig . 4 ) . I values as low as 40 mM have been suggested for cartilage because of the ionic exclusion properties of proteoglycans ( 54 ) . In os - teoarthritic cartilage , in which Hp has been found to constitute 3 – 4 % of proteoglycans ( 55 ) , the amount of albumin increases signiﬁcantly ( 56 ) . In such tissues , attractive serum albumin – Hp interactions may exist . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported by NSF Grant CHE - 9987891 .
