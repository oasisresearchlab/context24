Atzberger , 2 and Frank L . H . Brown 1 1 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry & Department of Physics 2 Department of Mathematics , University of California , Santa Barbara , CA 93106 , USA We introduce a simulation strategy to consistently couple continuum biomembrane dynamics to the motion of discrete biological macromolecules residing within or on the membrane . The methodology is used to study the diffusion of integral membrane proteins that impart a curvature on the bilayer surrounding them . Such proteins exhibit a substantial reduction in diffusion coefﬁcient relative to “ﬂat” proteins ; this effect is explained by elementary hydrodynamic considerations . PACS numbers : 87 . 15 . Vv , 83 . 10 . Mj , 87 . 16 . A - , 87 . 16 . D - Lipid - bilayer membranes are among the most important and most versatile components of biological cells [ 1 , 2 ] ; biomembranes protect cells from their surroundings , provide a means to compartmentalize subcellular structures ( and the functions of these structures ) and act as a scaffolding for countless biochemical reactions involving membrane associ - ated proteins . Our conceptual picture of biological mem - branes as a “two - dimensional oriented solution of integral proteins . . . in the viscous phospholipid bilayer” [ 3 ] was popu - larized well over thirty years ago . Quantitative physical mod - els for the energetics [ 4 ] and dynamics [ 5 ] associated with shape ﬂuctuations of homogeneous ﬂuid membranes and for the lateral diffusion coefﬁcient of integral membrane proteins within a ﬂat bilayer [ 6 ] were developed shortly thereafter and still ﬁnd widespread use up to this day . Interestingly , the coupling of protein diffusion to the shape of the membrane surface has become a subject of study only relatively recently ( see [ 7 , 8 , 9 ] and references within ) . One well studied consequence of membrane shape ﬂuctuations is that a protein must travel a longer distance between two points in 3D space if the paths connecting these points are con - strained to lie on a rough surface as opposed to a ﬂat plane . This purely geometric effect is expected to have practical ex - perimental implications ; measurements that capture a 2D pro - jection of the true motion over the membrane surface will infer diffusion coefﬁcients of diminished magnitude relative to the intrinsic lateral diffusion locally tangent to the bilayer surface [ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ] . Beyond this generic effect , which should apply to anything moving on the membrane surface in relatively passive fashion ( lipids , proteins , choleseterol , etc . ) , certain membrane associated proteins effect shape changes in the bilayer . Speciﬁc examples include the SERC1a calcium pump [ 12 ] and BAR ( Bin , Amphiphysin , Rvs ) domain dimers [ 13 ] . Direct structural evidence from X - ray crystallography [ 12 , 13 ] , experimental studies of vesicle topology at the mi - cron scale [ 13 , 14 ] , and atomically detailed simulations [ 15 ] all indicate the ability of these proteins to drive membrane curvature ( see Fig . 1 ) . The diffusion of membrane proteins with intrinsic curva - ture is more complex than the diffusion of a relatively pas - sive spectator and remains incompletely explored in the liter - ature . Although stochastic differential equations coupling the lateral motion of curved proteins to thermal shape ﬂuctuations of a continuous elastic bilayer have been proposed [ 11 , 16 ] , these equations have only been analyzed under the simplify - ing assumption that the protein does not affect the shape of the membrane surface . Under such an approximation , it was pre - dicted both analytically [ 11 ] and numerically [ 16 ] that curved proteins are expected to diffuse more rapidly than ﬂat ones . The full numerical analysis provided in the present work sug - gests exactly the opposite effect – protein curvature decreases lateral mobility across the bilayer . The disagreement with pre - vious work is attributable to the fact that the protein’s inﬂu - ence on bilayer shape is of primary importance ( see Fig . 1 ) and cannot be ignored . Our starting point is the Monge - gauge Helfrich Hamilto - nian [ 4 ] for energetics of a homogeneous membrane surface under conditions of vanishing tension H 0 = 1 2 Z A ⊥ d x (cid:2) K m ( ∇ 2 h ) 2 + 2 K ′ m G ( h ) (cid:3) , ( 1 ) where h ( x ) ≡ h ( x , y ) describes the local membrane displace - ment from a ﬂat reference plane at z = 0 ( see Fig . 1 ) . Here , G ( h ) = ( ∂ xx h∂ yy h − ∂ xy h∂ xy h ) is the Gaussian curvature and K m and K ′ m are the membrane bending modulus and saddle - splay modulus , respectively . The integration region , A ⊥ = L 2 , is always taken to be a square box with peri - odic boundary conditions assumed . We treat membrane pro - teins as localized regions of enhanced rigidity within the bi - layer . A single protein centered within the bilayer at position ( r ( t ) , h ( r ( t ) ) ) ≡ ( x ( t ) , y ( t ) , h ( x ( t ) , y ( t ) ) ) is thus assumed to modify the Hamiltonian as H = H 0 + H int with H int = 1 2 Z A ⊥ d x G p ( x − r ( t ) ) (cid:2) K p ( ∇ 2 h − 2 C p ) 2 ( 2 ) − K m ( ∇ 2 h ) 2 + 2 ( K ′ p − K ′ m ) G ( h ) (cid:3) . K p and K ′ p are the protein bending and saddle - splay moduli and C p is the spontaneous curvature associated with protein shape . The protein shape function G p ( x − r ( t ) ) describes the envelope of protein inﬂuence over bilayer elastic properties ; the speciﬁc function chosen will be discussed in detail below . 2 FIG . 1 : ( Color online ) An appropriately shaped protein will tend to distort the local shape of the bilayer into a bent conﬁguration . In our simulations , the protein’s effective size is deﬁned via the enve - lope function in Eq . ( 5 ) ( displayed next to the cartoon , top ) . The distortion is most readily seen by minimizing H for the composite protein - bilayer system ( middle ) , however the protein’s inﬂuence is strong enough to maintain visibly apparent perturbations , even in the presence of ﬂuctuations ( bottom ) . See Table I for parameters . Using a Fourier representation h ( x ) = 1 L 2 P q h q e i q · x , membrane dynamics may be cast as a set of coupled Langevin equations for the individual Fourier modes [ 17 , 18 ] ˙ h q ( t ) = Λ q F q ( t ) + q k B TL 2 Λ q ξ q ( t ) , ( 3 ) where F q ( t ) is the Fourier - transform of the force per unit area F ( x , t ) = − δ H / δh ( x , t ) , Λ q = 1 / ( 4 η q ) corresponds to the Oseen hydrodynamic kernel Λ ( x ) = 1 / ( 8 πη | x | ) , and ξ q ( t ) is a Gaussian white noise with h ξ q ( t ) i = 0 and h ξ q ( t ) ξ q ′ ( t ′ ) i = 2 δ q , − q ′ δ ( t − t ′ ) , to ensure satisfaction of the ﬂuctuation - dissipation theorem . The protein’s position may similarly be described in terms of a Langevin equation that implicitly enforces protein local - ization to the membrane surface [ 8 , 9 ] . The two independent variables describing this motion are the components of r ( t ) ( with i , j = 1 , 2 and summation convention assumed ) ˙ r i ( t ) = D 0 v i + p 2 D 0 τ ij η j ( t ) + D 0 k B T ( g − 1 ) ij f j . ( 4 ) Here ( g − 1 ) ij = δ ij − ∂ i h ∂ j h / g is the inverse metric ten - sor , g = 1 + ( ∇ h ) 2 is the determinant of the metric g ij = δ ij + ∂ i h ∂ j h and we have deﬁned ∂ i ≡ ∂ / ∂x i . Equation ( 4 ) introduces geometric factors including v i = − (cid:2) ( g − 1 ) jk ∂ j ∂ k h (cid:3) ∂ i h / g and τ ij = δ ij − ∂ i h ∂ j h / ( g + √ g ) ( i . e . , the square - root of the inverse metric tensor ( g − 1 ) ij = τ ik τ jk ) . The Gaussian white - noise η i ( t ) with h η i ( t ) i = 0 and h η i ( t ) η j ( t ′ ) i = δ ij δ ( t − t ′ ) guarantees that a tracer particle ( deﬁned by H int = 0 ) undergoes a curvilinear ran - dom walk over the membrane surface with diffusion coefﬁ - cient D 0 . The last term in Eq . ( 4 ) reﬂects the effect of the interaction - induced force f i = − ∂ H int / ∂x i . Equations ( 1 ) - ( 4 ) specify the stochastic thermal evolution for a single curved protein coupled to an elastic membrane . As noted above , equations very similar to these have been proposed previously [ 11 , 16 ] , but have only been analyzed by neglecting the contribution of H int to F q while maintaining its contribution to f i . To avoid this uncontrolled approxima - tion , it is necessary to introduce a numerical algorithm that can consistently couple protein position r ( t ) to membrane un - dulations h ( x , t ) . For both physical and numerical purposes , we must truncate the membrane modes at some short - distance scale a , which can for example be taken to represent the typical molecular ( lipid ) size or bilayer thickness . We thus limit the Fourier modes appearing in Eq . ( 3 ) to q = ( q x , q y ) = ( 2 πn , 2 πm ) / L where M = L / a with integer n , m in the range − M / 2 < n , m ≤ M / 2 . In principle , this reduced set of modes de - scribes a fully continuous membrane height proﬁle via h ( x ) = 1 L 2 P q h q e i q · x at any given point x . However , it is computa - tionally advantageous to explicitly track the membrane height only over the discrete M × M real - space lattice ( deﬁned at positions x α = ( p , q ) a with integer 0 ≤ p , q < M ) conjugate to the chosen h q ’s via Fast - Fourier Transformation [ 19 ] . The interaction between a fully continuous variable de - scribing protein position r ( t ) and a discrete representation of the membrane height ﬁeld { h ( x α , t ) } poses certain chal - lenges . A minor issue is that Eq . ( 4 ) requires the shape of the membrane surface over the entire x , y plane and not just at the lattice sites { x α } . This problem is readily handled via linear interpolation to obtain h ( x , t ) and the required deriva - tives at arbitrary x from the corresponding neighboring lat - tice values [ 8 ] . A more complex problem involves the dy - namics of the h q ( t ) ’s in Eq . ( 3 ) . The forces in this equa - tion include contributions due to the coupling between pro - tein and bilayer from Eq . ( 2 ) . The envelope function G p ( x ) reﬂects protein size and is quite localized in real space ; the natural way to deal with Eq . ( 2 ) ( and the related force expres - sions ) is to approximate the integral by simple quadrature , i . e . R d x G p ( x − r ( t ) ) F ( x ) ≈ a 2 P α G p ( x α − r ( t ) ) F ( x α ) for arbitrary function F . To deﬁne a numerical scheme that is both efﬁcient and accurate , the speciﬁc functional form cho - sen for G p is critical . Naive continuous choices like 2D Gaus - sians [ 16 , 18 ] lead to an effective normalization ( as computed by quadrature ) that varies with the offset between the enve - lope center and the discrete lattice . Piecewise linear forms for G p can be deﬁned that suffer no such normalization is - sue , but such functions lead to discontinuous derivatives as the protein - lattice offset changes . Both scenarios are unac - ceptable as these numerical issues lead to a breaking of the homogeneity of the membrane surface ; the protein will tend to favor ( or disfavor ) lattice sites over other regions of space . Our numerical description of coupled membrane - protein dynamics shares features with the Immersed Boundary for - mulation of hydrodynamics [ 20 ] . In that work , a series of envelope functions are introduced that are continuous , local - 3 parameter box lattice protein temperature bare protein bilayer protein saddle - splay protein solvent dimension spacing area diffusion bending bending moduli spontaneous viscosity coefﬁcient modulus modulus curvature symbol L a M = La A p T D 0 K m K p K ′ m ( p ) C p η value 250nm 2 . 5nm 100 100 nm 2 300 K 5 . 0 µ m 2 s 5 k B T 40 k B T − K m ( p ) 0 . 1 nm − 1 η w = 0 . 001 Pa · s TABLE I : Default parameter values used in the simulations . The protein area is chosen as A p = ( 4 a ) 2 ( giving a protein diameter of a p ∼ 10 nm ) , the D 0 value qualitatively reﬂects the motion of band 3 protein dimers on the surface of human red blood cells [ 18 ] , and η w stands for the viscosity of water . For simplicity we assume that both bilayer and protein saddle - splay moduli are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the corresponding bending moduli . ized in space and strictly preserve normalization as evalu - ated by quadrature . For our purposes , we take G p ( x ) = ( A p / a 2 ) φ ( x / a ) φ ( y / a ) with [ 20 ] φ (cid:0) 2 u (cid:1) = 1 16   5 + 2 u − √− 7 − 12 u − 4 u 2 − 2 ≤ u ≤ − 1 , 3 + 2 u + √ 1 − 4 u − 4 u 2 − 1 ≤ u ≤ 0 , 3 − 2 u + √ 1 + 4 u − 4 u 2 0 ≤ u ≤ 1 , 5 − 2 u − √− 7 + 12 u − 4 u 2 1 ≤ u ≤ 2 , ( 5 ) and zero for all other u values ( see Fig . 1 for a plot ) . A p deﬁnes an effective protein area and the envelope function is non - vanishing over a total of 64 lattice sites . In order to simu - late the dynamics of the system , we evolve Eqs . ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) in time via the Euler - Maruyuma method [ 21 ] . The resulting al - gorithm is essentially an application of “Brownian dynamics with hydrodynamic interactions” [ 22 ] applied to membrane shape ﬂuctuations and protein motion . Adopting the envelope function deﬁned in Eq . ( 5 ) allows a seamless melding of the approaches introduced in Refs . [ 8 , 9 , 18 ] ( a detailed descrip - tion of our algorithm will be provided in a future publication ) . The protein’s inﬂuence on the membrane is most easily seen in the absence of thermal shape ﬂuctuations of the membrane , but for sufﬁciently large C p and K p values the effect of the protein remains clearly visible despite thermal ﬂuctuations of the membrane surface ( see Fig . 1 ) . The average distortion of the membrane surrounding the protein is sufﬁcient to signif - icantly slow protein motion in all cases we have studied ( see Fig . 2 ) . This slowing derives from two effects . First , the pro - tein tends to trap itself in the deformation created by its own perturbation to the bilayer . The energy - minimized conﬁgura - tion displayed in Fig . 1 places the protein at the bottom of a curved valley ; attempted diffusion up the walls of this valley is hindered by the interaction - induced force in Eq . ( 4 ) . Sec - ond , x , y translation of the protein is accompanied by trans - lation of the membrane deformation surrounding this protein . The hydrodynamic effects included in Eq . ( 3 ) dictate that the translation of such a deformation is resisted by the viscous drag of the medium surrounding the bilayer . This drag acts in addition to the usual quasi - 2D drag incorporated within D 0 and slows protein motion . These effects are most pronounced when shape ﬂuctuations of the bilayer are neglected by setting T = 0 in Eq . ( 3 ) . Increasing the local deformation around the protein or the solvent viscosity both decrease D . In Fig . 2 we display three means to control this effect . Increasing C p drives large deformations from a ﬂat plane for any ﬁnite K p . Larger values of K p will tend to increase this effect up until the point where the rigidity of the protein becomes effectively inﬁnite and the response to the protein saturates . The hydrodynamic drag in our model is controlled via η ; increases in η reduce D as effectively as do perturbations to membrane shape . Within the asymmetric coupling approximation , which ig - nores the inﬂuence of the protein on membrane shape , it is predicted that bilayer shape ﬂuctuations will enhance curved protein mobility [ 11 , 16 ] ( i . e . D > D 0 , insets Fig . 2 ) . Al - though this effect can be seen in our simulations , the enhance - ment is slight ( relative to the similar effect within the afore - mentioned approximation scheme ) and can not overcome the dominant slowing caused by the protein’s distortion of the bi - layer ( compare open circles and triangles , Fig . 2 ) . We ﬁnd D < D 0 for all cases studied , which represents a qualitative departure from earlier predictions . We may approximately account for the viscous drag ef - fect discussed above by invoking an adiabatic approximation and assuming that the energy - minimized membrane distortion proﬁle ( denoted by ¯ h ( x , t ) ) instantaneously tracks protein po - sition . Hence , ˙¯ h ( x , t ) = − v · ∇ ¯ h ( x , t ) , ( 6 ) for a protein moving at constant lateral velocity v . The power dissipated by viscous losses in the medium may be calcu - lated from P = 1 L 2 P q ˙¯ h q ( t ) F − q ( t ) , where F q ( t ) follows from Eq . ( 3 ) as F q = ˙¯ h q / Λ q . Thus , by using Eq . ( 6 ) , the power loss may be written as P = 1 L 2 P q ( v · q ) 2 | ¯ h q | 2 / Λ q ≡ | v | 2 / µ def with µ def being the effective mobility of the de - formation . The effective protein diffusion coefﬁcient follows from D def = µ def k B T and D − 1 = ( D − 1 0 + D − 1 def ) to give 1 D ≈ 1 D 0 + 2 η k B TL 2 X q | q | 3 | ¯ h q | 2 . ( 7 ) This expression depends only on the minimized deformation proﬁle of the membrane at ﬁxed protein position and is read - ily calculated ( shown as solid squares in Fig . 2 ) . Although the approximation is imperfect due to neglect of membrane ﬂuctuations and the self - trapping effect discussed above , the adiabatic results serve as a reliable estimator of the observed trends for the full simulation .

Diffusion coefﬁcients are calculated as D = [ r ( t ) − r ( 0 ) ] 2 / ( 4 t ) . The simula - tions run for ∼ 5 × 10 7 time steps of size ∆ t ∼ 0 . 01 ns , ensuring both numerical accuracy and statistically reliable results . The protein’s root - mean - square displacements over the course of the simulations are approximately 100nm ( i . e . 20 times the protein’s radius ) . do note that recent experiments [ 23 ] show deviations from the standard theory [ 6 ] used to predict membrane - protein mobil - ity . The effect described here may prove to be important in describing these deviations for certain proteins . The solvent viscosity dependence we ﬁnd is at odds with the weak ( log - arithmic ) dependence expected for ﬂat proteins [ 6 ] and pro - vides a concrete means to verify our predictions experimen - tally .
