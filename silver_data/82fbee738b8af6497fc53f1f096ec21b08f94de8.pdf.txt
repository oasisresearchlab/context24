Dynamin at actin tails Eunkyung Lee and Pietro De Camilli * Department of Cell Biology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Yale University School of Medicine , P . O . Box 9812 , New Haven , CT 06536 - 0812 Contributed by Pietro De Camilli , November 14 , 2001 Dynamin , the product of the shibire gene of Drosophila , is a GTPase critically required for endocytosis . Some studies have suggested a functional link between dynamin and the actin cytoskeleton . This link is of special interest , because there is evidence implicating actin dynamics in endocytosis . Here we show that endogenous dynamin 2 , as well as green ﬂuorescence protein fusion proteins of both dynamin 1 and 2 , is present in actin comets generated by Listeria or by type I PIP kinase ( PIPK ) overexpression . In PIPK - induced tails , dynamin is further enriched at the interface between the tails and the moving organelles . Dynamin mutants harboring mutations in the GTPase domain inhibited nucleation of actin tails induced by PIPK and moderately reduced their speed . Although dynamin localization to the tails required its proline - rich domain , expression of a dynamin mutant lacking this domain also dimin - ished tail formation . In addition , this mutant disrupted a mem - brane - associated actin scaffold ( podosome rosette ) previously shown to include dynamin . These ﬁndings suggest that dynamin is part of a protein network that controls nucleation of actin from membranes . At endocytic sites , dynamin may couple the ﬁssion reaction to the polymerization of an actin pool that functions in the separation of the endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane . D ynamin is a GTPase critically required for endocytosis ( reviewed in refs . 1 – 3 ) . In Drosophila , temperature - sensitive mutations of the shibire gene , which encodes dynamin , produce a temperature - sensitive paralysis resulting from a block of the internalization of synaptic vesicle membranes ( 4 ) . Similarly , overexpression of dominant negative mutants of dynamin in mammalian cells inhibits several forms of endocytosis ( 5 – 9 ) . Ultrastructural studies have shown that dynamin assembles into rings at the neck of deeply invaginated endocytic pits ( 4 , 10 , 11 ) . These rings are thought to play an important role in fission , although their precise mechanism of action remains unclear ( 3 ) . They may mediate a constriction of the bud neck and then its scission via a GTP - hydrolysis - dependent conformational change ( 10 – 12 ) . Alternatively , they may act indirectly by recruiting and (cid:1) or activating other proteins that function as the final effectors in fission ( 13 ) . Dynamin comprises several distinct modules : an NH2 - terminal GTPase domain , a pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain , a predicted coiled - coil domain [ GTPase effector domain ( GED ) ] that may function as a GTPase activating protein for the GTPase domain , and a COOH - terminal proline - rich domain ( PRD ) . In the cytoplasm , dynamin shuttles between a cytosolic state and a membrane - bound state . Binding to the membrane is mediated by its PH domain , which binds PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 14 , 15 ) , and by a region upstream of this domain that can directly penetrate into the lipid bilayer ( 16 ) . In the assembled dynamin ring , the GED domain is thought to form an intermolecular contact with the GTPase domain of adjacent dynamin molecules , thus pro - viding an explanation for the stimulation of GTPase activity produced by dynamin self - assembly ( 17 ) . The PRD represents a site of interaction with a variety of SH3 - containing proteins ( 18 ) and was proposed to be responsible for the recruitment of dynamin to sites of endocytosis ( 19 – 21 ) . PRDs of dynamin oligomers may be engaged in multiple interactions with different SH3 - containing proteins , thus mediating the formation of a protein network . In such a way , PRDs not only may participate in dynamin recruitment to endocytic sites but also may contrib - ute to the recruitment of other cytoplasmic proteins or protein scaffolds to assembled dynamin oligomers . Early studies of Drosophila shibire mutants revealed defects in growth cone motility at the restrictive temperature ( 22 ) . A similar effect was produced by the disruption of dynamin func - tion in vitro by using antisense oligonucleotides ( 23 ) . These results had raised the possibility that dynamin could play a role in actin dynamics in addition to its role in endocytosis . Recently , this hypothesis received further support from the observation of direct and indirect interactions of dynamin with actin regulatory proteins and from the localization of dynamin at actin - rich sites at cell periphery . Affinity chromatography on profilin , a protein that facilitates actin polymerization ( 24 ) , identified dynamin as a main binding protein ( 25 ) . In addition , some of the major SH3 domain interactors of dynamin’s PRD are members of evolu - tionary conserved protein families implicated in actin function . These include syndapin (cid:1) pacsin , amphiphysin (cid:1) Rvs167 , intersec - tin (cid:1) DAP160 , cortactin , Abp1 , and Grb2 ( reviewed in refs . 26 and 27 ) . Via proteins like Grb2 , syndapin , and intersectin , dynamin can associate with the neural Wiskott – Aldrich syn - drome protein ( N - WASP ) ( 28 – 30 ) , a major regulator of actin polymerization ( 31 , 32 ) . Furthermore , via the dbl domain of intersectin , dynamin is linked to activation of cdc42 ( 30 ) , a rho family small GTPase that cooperates with N - WASP in actin nucleation ( reviewed in ref . 33 ) . Dynamin colocalizes with actin at peripheral ruffles in fibroblasts ( 34 ) and at adhesion sites ( podosome rosettes ) between cells and the substrate in baby hamster kidney cell line ( BHK21 ) cells transformed with Rous sarcoma virus ( BHK (cid:1) RSV ) ( 35 ) . In macrophages , dynamin is present at phagocytic cups , and a mutant form of dynamin ( K44A ) blocks phagocytosis ( 9 ) . A connection of dynamin to actin function is of significant interest because genetic studies in yeast have shown an important link between endocytosis and the actin cytoskeleton ( 36 , 37 ) . In addition , morphological and physiological studies have impli - cated actin in various forms of endocytosis , including receptor - mediated endocytosis ( reviewed in ref . 26 ) . In nerve terminals , where a dynamin - dependent endocytic reaction plays a critical role in the recycling of synaptic vesicles , endocytic sites are enriched in actin ( 38 , 39 ) . Finally , actin comets originating form endocytic vesicles have been reported ( 40 , 41 ) . The goal of this study was to explore further a functional relationship between dynamin and actin . To this aim , we have focused on actin comets , a powerful model system for the study of regulatory mechanisms in actin nucleation in vivo ( 41 – 43 ) . For our analysis , we have used prominent actin tails induced by infection with Listeria or by overexpression of type I PIP kinase ( PIPK ) , a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 generating enzyme ( 43 , 44 ) .

Dynamin 1 - aa GFP in the same vector was a kind gift from V . Slepnev . Other dynamin 2 - aa mutant constructs were generated from dynamin 2 - aa GFP by using the QUICKCHANGE kit from Stratagene and Pwo Polymerase ( Roche ) . A mammalian expression vector of type I PIPK was generated by placing hemagglutinin ( HA ) - tagged type I PIPK (cid:1) isoform ( PIPKI (cid:1) ) from pBluescript - HA - PIPKI (cid:1) ( a kind gift from Y . Oka ) intopCDNA3 ( Invitrogen ) . Thedynamin2 - aaPRD - GFPconstruct was generated by inserting amino acids 735 – 869 of dynamin 2 - aa fused to GFP into pCDNA3 . The dynamin 2 - aa (cid:1) PRD - GFP construct was generated by PCR amplification of the dynamin 2 regioncorrespondingtoaminoacids1 – 745 ( 34 ) andinsertionofthis fragment into the pEGFP - N1 vector . Transfection and Listeria Infection . HeLa cells were transfected with wild - type and mutant dynamin – GFP constructs by Lipo - fectamine 2000 ( Life Technology , Gaithersburg , MD ) . After 12 – 16 h , they were infected with Listeria monocytogenes as described ( 42 ) and observed after 10 h . A wild - type ( kindly provided by G . Galan ) and a mutant strain of Listeria that is deficient in D - alanine synthesis was used ( a generous gift from D . Portnoy ) ( 45 ) . In the latter case , the culture medium was supplemented with 100 (cid:2) g (cid:1) ml of D - alanine to allow normal actin - based motility of the bacteria , as described ( 45 ) . PIPK transfection of several cell types revealed that BHK (cid:1) RSV ( a kind gift of P . C . Marchisio ) ( 35 ) generated the best actin tails . These cells were cotransfected with PIPK and dynamin – GFP constructs . Wild - type and mutant dynamins were trans - fected in parallel by using the same concentration of DNA , and cells with comparable degree of fluorescence were analyzed for measurements of tail speed . Cells were typically observed 10 – 15 h after transfection to minimize cell damage induced by expres - sion of PIPK or mutant dynamin proteins . Cell Labeling and Immunostaining . Cells were fixed and processed for immunocytochemistry as described ( 35 ) . Actin was stained with tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate ( TRITC ) - phalloidin ( Sigma ) after paraformaldehyde fixation . For immu - nostaining of endogenous dynamin 2 in Listeria tails , rat epi - thelial PtK2 cells were used instead of HeLa cells , because our anti - rat dynamin 2 antibodies did not detect endogenous human dynamin 2 . Anti - dynamin 2 antibody ( a kind gift from G . - C . Ochoa ) was generated in rabbits by injecting amino acids 761 – 787 ( SHSPTPQRRPVSSVHPPGRPPAVRPHT ) of rat dy - namin 2 , i . e . , the same immunogen used to generate the so - called dyn2 antibodies ( 35 , 46 ) . Affinity purification was performed on the same peptide coupled to SulfoLink Coupling Gel ( Bio - Rad ) according to the manufacturer’s instruction . Primary antibodies were revealed with Oregon green - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgGs ( Molecular Probes ) . To label endocytic vesicles , cells were incubated with 1 mg (cid:1) ml of TRITC - dextran ( Sigma ) for 30 min and washed twice before fixation . For Golgi staining , Bodipy Texas red ceramide ( Mo - lecular Probes ) was used , following the manufacturer’s instruc - tion . For transferrin uptake , cells were incubated with 20 (cid:2) g (cid:1) ml of Cy3 - transferrin for 10 min at 37°C before fixation . Specimens were observed by confocal microscopy . The number of actin tails was counted from phalloidin staining in fixed GFP - positive cells . The tail number in cells expressing GFP fusions of mutant dynamins is given as percentage of tails observed in cells expressing wild - type dynamin 2 – GFP . On the basis of counterstaining for the HA tag of PIPK , more than 90 % of GFP fluorescent cells coexpressed PIPK . Microscopy of Living Cells . All experiments were performed at room temperature unless indicated otherwise , and movies ( see Movies 1 and 2 , which are published as supporting information on the PNAS web site , www . pnas . org ) were generated from 5 - to 10 - min observations . For Listeria motility , live cells were ob - served with a Bio - Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope by using a 63 (cid:2) water immersion lens ( N . A . 1 . 25 , Zeiss ) . Movies were imported into NIH IMAGE 1 . 62 ( developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on the internet at http : (cid:1)(cid:1) rsb . info . nih . gov (cid:1) nih - image (cid:1) ) . Movies of PIPK - induced vesicles were generated by capturing images with a charge - coupled device camera ( Micromax 1300 YHS , Roper Scientific ) . Or - ganelle speed was measured by calculating the distance traveled in consecutive frames using METAMORPH software ( Universal Imaging ) . Results Dynamin Is Present in Listeria Tails . When HeLa cells were trans - fected with dynamin 1 - or dynamin 2 - GFP and then infected with L . monocytogenes , strong GFP fluorescence was observed at the tails of moving bacteria [ Fig . 1 A , supporting information on the PNAS web site ( www . pnas . org ) , and data not shown ] . As re - vealed by counterstaining with phalloidin , the GFP fluorescence pattern had a distribution very similar to that of filamentous actin ( Fig . 1 B and C ) . Immunostaining of Listeria - infected PtK2 cells with anti - rat dynamin 2 antibodies showed a similar local - ization of endogenous dynamin 2 in actin tails ( Fig . 1 D ) . Interestingly , dynamin staining was barely detectable on non - moving bacteria , despite the presence of a shell of phalloidin staining on their surface ( arrowheads in Fig . 1 B ) . It was previ - Fig . 1 . Localizationoffulllengthdynaminanddynamin - PRDatactintailsof Listeria .

Thus , the absence of dynamin from nonmoving bacteria indicates this protein is selectively associated with a dynamic actin pool . A GFP - fusion construct of the PRD of dynamin 2 ( PRD - GFP ) was also found at Listeria tails , although it was less efficiently concentrated in these structures than the full length protein ( Fig . 1 E ) . Dynamin Is Present at Tails Induced by Overexpression of PIPK . Actin tails are likely to play an important role in the motility of endogenous cell organelles ( 40 , 41 ) . However , tails easily de - tectable by light microscopy are seldom observed in normal cells . They can be induced by several treatments besides pathogen infection , such as overexpression of type I PIPK ( 43 ) , which stimulates PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production , or expression of the active form of arf6 ( 48 ) , which may act , at least partially , via the recruitment of type I PIPK ( 49 ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , in turn , may act as a cofactor in the recruitment and (cid:1) or activation of actin regulatory proteins ( 50 ) . To determine whether dynamin is also recruited to the tails of these endogenous organelles , targeting of dynamin 1 - and dynamin 2 - GFP was investigated in cells transiently cotrans - fected with the HA - tagged (cid:1) isoform of type I PIPK ( PIPKI (cid:1) ) ( 44 , 51 ) . As previously shown in cells overexpressing (cid:3) and (cid:4) isoforms of type I PIPK , many cells overexpressing PIPKI (cid:1) contained numer - ous actin tails ( 43 ) ( Fig . 2 A – D and supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . At least some of them originated from vesicles of the endocytic pathway , because after a 30 - min incubation with TRITC – dextran ( a fluid phase endocytic marker ) , 33 % ( 15 (cid:1) 45 ) of the comets originated from dextran - containing vesicles . Some of the other tails may originate from Golgi - derived vesicles , because after 1 - h labeling with Bodipy Texas red - ceramide , 13 % ( 10 (cid:1) 76 ) of them had a Texas red - positive organelle at their tips . Bodipy Texas red – ceramide is a membrane - permeable fluorescent precursor of sphingolipidsthatbecomesincorporatedintoGolgi - derivedvesicles destined to reach the plasma membrane via the secretory pathway ( 52 ) . Dynamin 1 - GFP ( data not shown ) , dynamin 2 - GFP ( Fig . 2 A , B , and D ) , and endogenous dynamin 2 ( Fig . 2 C ) were concentrated at these comets , irrespective of the cargo present at their tips ( Fig . 2 D ) . Both endogenous and full length dynamin - GFP were further enriched in close proximity of the moving organelle relative to phalloidin staining ( Fig . 2 B and C ) . In contrast , PRD - GFP was present at low concentration throughout the tail ( Fig . 2 E ) . Although well recognizable tails were visible only in PIPK overexpressing cells , high - power observation often revealed very small tail - like structures positive for dynamin 2 - GFP even in cells that are not cotransfected with this lipid kinase ( Fig . 2 F ) .

Whether they represent bona fide tails of endogenous organelles deserves further investigation . MutantDynaminsInhibitTailFormationandReduceTailSpeed . Next , we investigated whether the GTPase cycle of transfected dynamin affects the formation of actin tails or their dynamics . Several dynamin mutants containing amino acid changes in the GTPase domain have a powerful dominant negative effect on endocytosis ( 5 – 7 ) . Two such mutants of dynamin 2 - GFP were tested : the K44A mutation , which results in lower affinity for guanylnucleotides , and the D208N mutation , which is predicted to have reduced affinity for GTP ( 5 , 6 ) . Both mutants inhibited transferrin uptake as expected ( Fig . 3 A and data not shown ) . Furthermore , both mutants greatly reduced , by 59 and 61 % respectively , the number of tails induced by PIPK overexpression ( Fig . 3 C ) . They also reduced the number of Listeria tails ( data not shown ) , although this effect could have resulted , at least partially , from an inhibitory effect of the mutant dynamins on bacteria infection . Both K44A dynamin 2 - GFP and D208N dynamin 2 - GFP , nonetheless , were associated with Listeria and PIPK - induced tails in the corresponding cells ( Fig . 3 B and data not shown ) . The speed of these tails was moderately reduced but in a statistically significant way , relative to the tails of cells transfected withwild - typedynamin2 - GFP ( Fig . 3 D ) . Collectively , thesefindings suggest that dynamin , via its GTPase domain , may contribute to the nucleation of actin tails at specific intracellular sites . The presence of both wild - type and GTPase domain mutants of dynamin in actin tails may reflect interactions of the PRD because , when expressed alone , this domain is enriched in tails ( see above ) . Dynamin interacting proteins , such as profilin , cortactin , and Abp1 ( 25 , 34 , 53 ) , may be responsible for this localization of the PRD , because these dynamin interactors were recently described in actin tails ( refs . 24 , 48 , and 54 , and M . Kessels , personal communication ) . To elucidate further the role of this domain in the targeting of dynamin , we also expressed a dynamin 2 - GFP mutant in which the entire PRD ( the last 124 amino acids ) had been deleted ( (cid:1) PRD dynamin 2 - GFP ) . In contrast to dynamin GTPase domain mutants , (cid:1) PRD dynamin 2 - GFP was not detectable in the tails ( data not shown ) , con - firming a critical role of the PRD in targeting full length dynamin 2 to actin tails . Surprisingly , this fusion protein as well , which potently blocks endocytosis ( data not shown ) , inhibited tail formation . The number of tails was reduced by 55 % compared with the cells expressing wild - type dynamin 2 ( Fig . 4 A ) . An effect of (cid:1) PRD dynamin 2 - GFP was also observed on other actin - containing structures . We have recently reported a colocal - ization of dynamin with actin at podosome rosettes of RSV transformed BHK21 cells ( arrowheads in Fig . 4 B ) ( 35 ) . These rosettes represent sites of contact between cells and the substratum , where actin forms columnar arrays that are perpendicular to the plasma membrane and often contain a tubular invagination of this membrane ( 35 ) . The PRD of dynamin plays an important role in targeting of dynamin to these structures , because a GFP fusion protein of the PRD colocalized with actin at podosome rosettes ( Fig . 4 B ) . Surprisingly , expression of (cid:1) PRD dynamin 2 - GFP almost completely disrupted the rosettes ( in 146 of 152 cells counted , or 96 % ; see also Fig . 4 C ) . Collectively , these results imply that (cid:1) PRD dynamin 2 may sequester a critical factor for actin nucleation from membranes or for continued actin polymerization . Thus , an inter - play the PRD and the other portions of dynamin is needed for the physiological function of this GTPase . Discussion The results reported in this study provide strong in vivo evidence for a functional link of dynamin to the actin cytoskeleton . They are convergent with growing evidence for a role of actin in endocytosis and suggest that dynamin itself has a function in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton at endocytic sites . An attractive possibility is that dynamin may act at multiple steps in vesicle budding and may first help in generating and constricting the vesicle neck ( 4 , 10 – 12 ) . As the endocytic reaction proceeds to fission , oligomerized dynamin may also help to recruit an actin nucleating machinery via proteins that bind its PRD . After fission , this actin meshwork may help propelling the vesicle away from the endocytic site , either by comets or other actin - based transport mechanisms . Furthermore , a role of actin itself in fission cannot be ruled out . Recent studies have revealed a central role of the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex in the formation of crosslinked actin meshwork , such as those found in actin tails of Listeria and intracellular organelles ( 43 , 55 ) . The upstream regulators of the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , however , may vary at distinct sites of actin nucleation ( 56 ) . We speculate that dynamin may be part of this regulatory machinery at sites of endocytosis . Its regulatory action may be achieved through an indirect interaction with the neural Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein and the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , for example via Grb2 or via SH3 domain - containing protein scaffolds , including syndapin (cid:1) pacsin , Abp1 , intersectin , and cortactin among other proteins ( 18 , 26 , 27 , 30 , 34 , 53 ) . Dynamin may also play a regulatory role in actin nucleation at nonendocytic sites , as Fig . 3 . Effect of GTPase domain dynamin mutants on endocytosis and actin comets .

On the basis of the modular structure of dynamin , we suggest the following model . The PRD of dynamin is a critical determinant for the interaction of this protein with the actin cytoskeleton , as revealed by its targeting to actin - rich sites when separated from the remaining portion of the protein . The PH domain , which binds PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 14 , 15 ) , and an amino acid stretch upstream of PH domain , which can insert into the lipid bilayer ( 16 ) , help the protein to anchor at the membrane . Via this dual interaction with the membrane and the cytoskeleton , dynamin may facilitate nucleation of actin at specific membrane sites , such as the necks of coated pits . The GTPase domain , through yet unknown mechanisms , may play a regulatory role on this property of dynamin to connect the membrane to the actin cytoskeleton and on the intracellular sites where this adaptor function must be achieved . Intra - and intermo - lecular interactions within dynamin oligomers or interactions of the GTPase domain with other proteins may mediate this regulation . The importance of the GTPase domain is indicated by the inhib - itory role on the formation of actin tails by expression of dynamins containing mutations in such domain . Our results indicate that dynamin GTPase domain mutants inhibit primarily tail nucleation , with a moderate effect on tail motility . Thus , once tails have been formed , the function of dynamin GTPase in actin assembly becomes less critical . This finding is not surprising if one considers that dynamic actin tails have been reconstituted in vitro with purified components that do not include dynamin . In conclusion , on the basis of the findings reported in this study , we propose that the link to the actin cytoskeleton may represent a critical aspect of dynamin function in endocytosis . It is also likely that dynamin plays a more general role in actin – membrane interactions . We thank Dr . Vladimir Slepnev and Dr . Gian - Carlo Ochoa ( our laboratory ) , Dr .
