Loss - of - function 12 mutations in a C . elegans ortholog of the Rac1 GTPase ( ced - 10 ) and its GEF complex ( ced - 13 5 / DOCK180 , ced - 2 / CrkII , ced - 12 / ELMO ) cause gonad migration defects related to directional 14 sensing ; we discovered an additional defect class of gonad bifurcation in these mutants . Using 15 genetic approaches , tissue - specific and whole - body RNAi , and in vivo imaging of endogenously 16 tagged proteins and marked cells , we find that loss of Rac1 or its regulators causes the DTC to 17 fragment as it migrates . Both products of fragmentation—the now - smaller DTC and the 18 membranous patch of cellular material—localize important stem cell niche signaling ( LAG - 19 2 / DSL ligand ) and migration ( INA - 1 / integrin subunit alpha ) factors to their membranes , but only 20 one retains the DTC nucleus and therefore the ability to maintain gene expression over time . 21 The enucleate patch can lead a bifurcating branch off the gonad arm that grows through germ 22 cell proliferation . Germ cells in this branch differentiate as the patch loses LAG - 2 expression . 23 While the nucleus is surprisingly dispensable for aspects of leader cell function , it is required for 24 stem cell niche activity long - term . Prior work found that Rac1 - / - ; Rac2 - / - mouse erythrocytes 25 fragment ; in this context , our new findings support the conclusion that maintaining a cohesive 26 but deformable cell is a conserved function of this important cytoskeletal regulator . 27 28 INTRODUCTION 29 The formation of each of the two arms of the C . elegans hermaphrodite gonad is led by a post - 30 embryonic migration of a somatic gonad leader cell , the distal tip cell ( DTC ) 1 – 3 . DTCs begin 31 migrating – nonprotrusively 4 – in opposite directions from the site of the future vulva along the 32 ventral midline at the L2 larval stage . In the L3 larval stage , each DTC executes two 90 - degree 33 turns that establish the gonad bend . DTC migration continues along the dorsal body wall during 34 the L3 and L4 larval stages until the two DTCs both reach the dorsal midbody , where they 35 remain throughout adulthood 2 , 5 , 6 . Proliferating germ cells provide a propulsive force to the DTC , 36 which interacts with the extracellular matrix to steer the direction of migration 4 . 37 38 The distal - most end of the adult germline—capped by the DTC—is composed of germ stem 39 cells followed proximally by their still - mitotic descendants , together comprising the proliferative 40 zone 7 . The DTC acts as the germ stem cell niche by expressing the ligand LAG - 2 8 , which is 41 transduced by the GLP - 1 / Notch receptor in germ cells . Active Notch signaling in the germline 42 leads to post - transcriptional repression of meiotic entry factors to prevent differentiation 9 . 43 Proximal to the proliferative zone , germ cells lose active Notch signaling , lose the repression of 44 meiotic entry factors , enter meiosis , and eventually differentiate as gametes 10 – 12 . 45 Hermaphrodites make sperm cells in the L4 larval stage and oocytes as adults 13 , 14 . An essential 46 feature of the adult hermaphrodite germline is that some meiotic cells do not form gametes , but 47 instead take on a nurse - cell - like role in which they donate their cytoplasmic contents to oocytes 48 and undergo apoptosis , becoming engulfed by the somatic gonadal sheath cells that wrap 49 around the germline 15 , 16 . 50 51 2 Apoptosis and engulfment of dead cells are regulated by highly conserved factors , first identified 52 in a C . elegans genetic screen for animals with abnormal cell death ( ced mutants ) 17 – 25 . 53 Engulfing cells activate two partially redundant ced pathways 26 , one of which has also been 54 shown to also be required for DTC migration 20 – 23 . This pathway is composed of CED - 55 10 / Rac1 22 – a regulator of the cytoskeleton 27 conserved among eukaryotes 28 – and factors that 56 have since been discovered to comprise its upstream activating guanine nucleotide exchange 57 factor ( GEF ) complex : CED - 5 / DOCK180 29 – 31 , CED - 2 / CrkII 22 , CED - 12 / ELMO 20 , 21 , 30 , 31 . ( CED - 12 58 has also recently been discovered to have GAP function in the context of F - actin nucleation in 59 C . elegans embryonic morphogenesis 32 ) . Rac GTPases , members of the Rho family of 60 GTPases , are required for cytoskeletal remodeling in protrusions at the leading edge of many 61 migratory cells 33 , 34 . However , the migratory DTC has a smooth leading edge 4 , 35 , 36 , both 62 distinguishing it from the classic model of leader cell migration 37 – 39 and raising the question of 63 how the Rac - pathway ced module – a canonical regulator of lamellipodia – regulates migration in 64 the non - protrusive cell leading gonadogenesis . The DTC may serve as a useful model for the 65 molecular regulation of tubular organs that form with migration of non - protrusive leader cells . 66 One way these Rac pathway ced genes regulate DTC migration is as downstream effectors of 67 noncanonical Wnt signaling 40 , 41 , culminating in repression of the netrin receptor UNC - 5 during 68 DTC dorsal migration 40 . 69 70 Genetic control of gonadogenesis is well - studied 1 , 42 , 43 , and many mutants with polarity 71 defects 40 , 41 , 44 and other gonad malformations have been identified 22 , 45 – 51 . Genetic studies of the 72 three C . elegans Rac - family GTPase - encoding genes ced - 10 22 , rac - 2 52 , and mig - 2 53 have 73 revealed that two play a role in DTC migration 22 , 52 , 54 . mig - 2 47 , 54 and ced - 10 22 cause DTC 74 migration defects when mutated . ced - 10 and rac - 2 are nearly identical at the sequence level 52 75 and act in different subsets of cell types ( rac - 2 is not expressed in the DTC 55 ) . How DTC - 76 migration genes act at a cellular level to coordinate the cell movements of organogenesis is an 77 area of increasing interest . Recent work using live - imaging techniques reveals the key role of 78 interactions between the DTC and extracellular matrix , mediated , for example , by integrin 4 79 ( which in C . elegans is composed of INA - 1 / PAT - 3 and PAT - 2 / PAT - 3 dimers 56 – 58 ) . We set out to 80 investigate a previously unreported class of gonad defect—bifurcation—in genetic mutants that 81 have long been known to have DTC migration defects . 82 83 Here we report that loss - of - function mutations in the Rac - pathway ced genes lead to the 84 fragmentation of the DTC as it migrates . Both products of fragmentation—the distal tip cell 85 ( reduced in size ) and the membranous patch of cellular material—localize important migration 86 ( an integrin alpha subunit , INA - 1 ) and signaling ( the Notch ligand LAG - 2 ) factors to their plasma 87 membrane . However , only one structure retains the DTC nucleus and therefore the ability to 88 maintain gene expression and synthesize new protein throughout adulthood . The patch can 89 promote local germ cell proliferation for a time , leading to a bifurcating branch off the gonad arm 90 that grows through germ cell proliferation until the patch loses LAG - 2 signal due to its lack of 91 nucleus . Cell fragmentation and changes in deformability have been documented in mammalian 92 cell types after Rac1 loss - of - function 59 – 61 ; we conclude that Rac1 is required to keep the DTC in 93 one piece during migration , and that the Rac pathway plays a fundamental and broadly - 94 conserved function in maintaining cellular integrity in a number of Eukaryotic cell types . 95 96 RESULTS 97 Loss of function of Rac - pathway ced genes causes gonad bifurcation 98 Mutations of the cell death pathway genes ced - 10 / Rac1 , ced - 5 / DOCK180 , ced - 2 / CrkII , and ced - 99 12 / ELMO have long been observed to cause gonad migration defects 20 – 22 , 29 , 52 . We examined 100 ced - 10 ( n1993 ) 22 , ced - 5 ( n1812 ) 29 , ced - 2 ( n1994 ) 22 , and ced - 12 ( n3261 ) 21 mutants , all of which are 101 putative null with the exception of ced - 10 ( n1993 ) , a hypomorph 22 , 52 . 102 3 Typically , each gonad arm forms a single U - shaped , blind tube 1 , 6 . In all four mutants , we 103 observed gonad bifurcation ( Figure 1 ) which was not identified in the original or subsequent 104 reports of gonad defects caused by mutations in ced genes ( Gumienny et al . , 2001 , wrote of a 105 different ced - 12 ( oz167 ) allele : “ ced - 12 mutants also occasionally show …short branching or 106 distensions” ) . At the L4 ( Figure 1B ) and young adult ( Figure 1C ) stages , we consistently 107 observe bifurcation in 10 - 16 % of animals ( Figure 1D ) . While misdirected DTC migration or 108 turning defects have been investigated in mutants for these 40 and other genes 35 , gonad 109 bifurcation is strikingly rare 62 – 64 . We decided to focus on this most severe phenotype to elucidate 110 additional roles of Rac - pathway ced genes in regulating DTC migration . 111 112 The Rac pathway acts cell - autonomously to regulate DTC leader cell activity , and loss of 113 function causes somatic gonad cell defects as well as gonad anatomy defects 114 To determine whether gonad bifurcation is caused by cell - autonomous loss of the Rac pathway 115 ced genes , we used a strain with DTC - specific sensitivity to RNAi and a distal tip cell membrane 116 marker 65 ( see Methods and Figure 2A ) to knock down ced - 10 , ced - 5 , ced - 2 , and ced - 12 in the 117 DTC . Indeed , ced gene knockdown in the DTC causes cell - autonomous defects that result in 118 bifurcation ( Figure 2B ) . We next examined the DTC itself in RNAi - treated animals . We made 119 two striking observations . First , when the gonad bifurcates , both tips have a focus of 120 mNeonGreen ( mNG ) signal ( Figure 2B ) , in contrast to the single focus of mNG signal in the 121 control RNAi - treated animals ( Figure 2A ) . Second , even when the gonad does not bifurcate , 122 there is a second patch of mNG signal near the bend of the gonad in 17 - 29 % of L4 larval 123 animals ( Figure 2B’ ) . Similar defects were also observed after RNAi of mig - 2 / RhoG , another 124 small Rac - family GTPase , but were not observed after knockdown of the parallel engulfment 125 pathway members ced - 1 and ced - 6 ( Figure S1 ) , in agreement with previously observed 126 specificity of the Rac pathway ced genes , but not other ced genes , for DTC migration 29 , 52 . 127 128 We next examined the DTC in the mutant animals . A cell membrane marker that is specific for 129 the DTC ( cpIs122 [ lag - 2p : : mNeonGreen : : PLC δPH ] 65 shows a single locus of expression in each 130 gonad arm in otherwise wild - type animals ( Figure 2A’ ) . In c ed - 10 ( n1993 ) , ced - 5 ( n1812 ) , ced - 131 2 ( n1994 ) , and ced - 12 ( n3261 ) mutants , this marker reveals the presence of a patch of mNG 132 fluorescence on both tips of bifurcated gonads ( Figure 2C ) and near the bend in gonads that do 133 not bifurcate ( Figure 2C’ ) . The second site of mNG expression appears with high penetrance 134 across mutants ( 57 - 80 % of mutant animals , N = 107 ) , and is always present when we see gonad 135 bifurcation ( N = 14 / 14 bifurcated mutant gonads with the DTC marker ) . Put another way , every 136 bifurcated gonad we observed has a second mNG + patch , but not every gonad with an ectopic 137 mNG + patch bifurcates . On the other hand , we did not observe a patch every time we observed 138 DTC pathfinding defects , suggesting these two defects reflect different aspects of Rac pathway 139 function in the DTC . We therefore conclude that Rac - pathway loss - of - function causes the 140 formation of this mNG + patch , and hypothesize that the patch sometimes causes gonad 141 bifurcation . 142 143 Somatic gonad defects appear during or just after DTC turning 144 We next sought the origin of the ectopic mNG + patch . We examined c ed - 10 ( n1993 ) , ced - 145 5 ( n1812 ) , ced - 2 ( n1994 ) , and ced - 12 ( n3261 ) mutants expressing the cpIs122 [ lag - 146 2p : : mNeonGreen : : PLC δPH ] 65 cell membrane marker during larval development . Early in gonad 147 migration ( Phase I : ventral migration ) , a single site of mNG is visible at the growing tip of each 148 gonad arm in wild - type and mutant gonads ( Figure 3 ) . As the DTC makes its turns or just after 149 ( Phase II : turning ) , a second mNG + patch appears in the mutant gonads , attached to the DTC 150 by a filament . Because the patch is connected to the DTC at its first appearance , we 151 hypothesize that the DTC is the source of the patch . Patches are observed in all four mutants by 152 Phase III : dorsal migration . 153 4 The DTC fragments after Rac - pathway ced loss of function 154 We tested several hypotheses about how the DTC might give rise to the patch . A bifurcated 155 gonad phenotype has been observed after RNAi treatments that interfere with the cell cycle 63 , 64 , 156 which cause the normally postmitotic DTC to divide aberrantly , or another somatic gonad cell to 157 be mis - specified as an extra DTC 62 , 66 . If the second focus of mNG is caused by aberrant cell 158 division or misspecification of another gonad cell , the “patch” would be a second cell with DTC 159 identity . We also considered that overexpression of membrane fluorescent transgene - encoded 160 proteins could cause abnormal cell growth 67 ; in that case , strains without such a transgene 161 should not form a patch . Finally , we considered that the DTC breaks apart without dividing , and 162 the patch is a membranous fragment of cellular material . 163 164 We first tested whether the patch was or was not a second distal tip cell . We examined a strain 165 expressing an allele encoding endogenously tagged GFP : : HLH - 2 protein 68 , a tagged 166 transcription factor that localizes to the nucleus of the DTC ( among other cells ) in control 167 gonads , with some dim cytoplasmic DTC fluorescence signal also observed ( Figure 4A ) . We 168 exposed the strain bearing this allele to ced - 5 and ced - 12 RNAi ( as these were the most 169 efficient RNAi treatments for causing gonad bifurcation ) and observed GFP : : HLH - 2 expression 170 in bifurcated gonads . If we detected a bright focus of nuclear signal of this tagged protein in both 171 bifurcated gonad tips , we would conclude that the DTC divided or a second somatic gonad cell 172 became mis - specified as a DTC . However , in 19 / 19 animals with bifurcated gonads , we observe 173 nuclear localization in only one of the two structures at the tips of the bifurcated gonads and dim 174 cytoplasmic expression in the other ( Figure 4B - C ) . Of note , the tip containing the nucleus of the 175 DTC is not always the tip closest to the correct anatomical position of the DTC ( Figure S2 ) . 176 Because GFP : : HLH - 2 is not encoded by an overexpressed transgene , nor does it encode a 177 membrane - localized fluorescent protein , this experiment also rules out the possibility that driving 178 an overexpressed fluorescent membrane protein in the DTC is responsible for the formation of 179 the structure at the second tip . 180 181 We observed the same pattern in a strain coexpressing a lag - 2 ( bmd202 [ lag - 2 : : P2A : : H2B : : mT2 ] ) 182 histone tag 69 and lag - 2p : : mNG membrane marker ( lag - 2p : : mNeonGreen : : PLC δPH ) . In an 183 otherwise wild - type genetic background , the DTC membrane and nucleus are the only sites of 184 expression of these markers in the distal gonad ( Figure 4D ) . After crossing these markers into a 185 ced - 5 ( n1812 ) background , nuclear expression is visible in only one of the two membranous 186 bodies ( Figure 4E ) . 187 188 We used this same experiment to quantify the sizes of the DTC and enucleate patch appearing 189 in ced - 5 ( n1812 ) mutant animals coexpressing the lag - 2 : : P2A : : H2B : : mT2 histone tag and the 190 lag - 2p : : mNG membrane marker vs . that of the otherwise wild - type DTC in L4 animals . After 191 fragmentation , ced - 5 mutant DTCs are smaller in their projected area than control DTCs , with 192 the patches smaller still ( Figure 4F ) . However , the summed sizes of the ced - 5 mutant DTC and 193 patch are not significantly different from the sizes of wild - type L4 DTCs , suggesting that we are 194 seeing two pieces of a fragmented DTC ( Figure 4F ) . We conclude that the ectopic patch is not a 195 daughter of the DTC nor a mis - specified second DTC in the affected gonad arm—it is a cell 196 fragment . This led us to ask how a fragment of cellular material can be competent to lead gonad 197 outgrowth . 198 199 Both fragments of the DTC localize integrin , required for DTC migration , throughout 200 larval development 201 We next sought to characterize the molecular repertoire of the structures that result from DTC 202 fragmentation . We hypothesized that the cell fragment must localize key regulators of both DTC 203 leader cell and stem cell niche functions in order to lead to the bifurcation of the gonad . Integrin , 204 5 a receptor that mediates cell interactions with extracellular matrix , is required during DTC 205 migration 4 , 56 , 58 . We examined a strain with an endogenously tagged INA - 1 : : mNG allele 70 , which 206 is localized to the surfaces of many cells , including the DTC ( Figure 5A ) . We asked if the patch 207 was decorated by INA - 1 : : mNG protein . We treated the strain with whole - body ced - 5 RNAi to 208 induce DTC fragmentation and imaged gonads with a second focus of INA - 1 : : mNG expression 209 at or near the gonad bend . In the L4 stage , the smaller DTC and the ectopic patch both continue 210 to localize endogenously tagged INA - 1 : : mNG on their surfaces ( Figure 5B and 5C ) . This is true 211 whether the DTC is the fragment that migrates in the correct ( Figure 5B ) or incorrect ( Figure 5C ) 212 direction . The ectopic patch therefore contains at least some of the cellular machinery that is 213 known to be required for DTC migration . 214 215 Both DTC fragments localize the stem cell niche stemness signal in larvae but only one 216 maintains expression in adults 217 LAG - 2 is a ligand that activates the GLP - 1 / Notch receptor on germ cells , acting as the stemness 218 cue , and is necessary for germ cell mitosis throughout gonad migration and adulthood 8 , 71 , 72 . 219 Germ cell mitosis provides the pushing force necessary for gonad elongation 4 , so we 220 hypothesized that in order for a gonad to bifurcate , both branches must support germ cell 221 proliferation with a source of LAG - 2 , at least for a time . We observed L4 animals of a strain 222 expressing endogenously tagged LAG - 2 : : mNG and lag - 2p : : myr : : TdTomato 73 to mark the DTC 223 membrane ( Figure 6A , top ) . We treated this strain with whole - body ced - 5 RNAi to induce DTC 224 fragmentation and investigated LAG - 2 : : mNG localization ( Figure 6B ) . Indeed , LAG - 2 : : mNG 225 signal was apparent on both structures that were positive for the lag - 2p : : myr : : TdTomato 226 membrane marker upon RNAi knockdown of ced - 5 ( Figure 6C ) , however the patch has less 227 total LAG - 2 : : mNG than the DTC ( Figure 6F ) . While the “patch” is not a cell with DTC identity , it 228 localizes a protein that can maintain stemness in nearby germ cells . 229 230 The ectopic patch does not maintain niche signaling protein long - term , but both DTC 231 fragments persist in adulthood 232 We interpreted the membrane - localized protein signal on the ectopic patch to come from 233 proteins present at the time of DTC fragmentation or produced soon thereafter . We 234 hypothesized that the enucleate patch has a minimal ability to synthesize new proteins because 235 it lacks a genome . We tested whether the patch can sustain stem cell niche function by 236 examining LAG - 2 : : mNG expression in adult animals . In control young adults at the onset of 237 oogenesis , the LAG - 2 : : mNG protein localizes to the DTC body and its processes ( Figure 6D ) . In 238 young adult ced - 5 RNAi - treated animals , we first observed the lag - 2p : : myrTdTomato 239 membrane - marking signal decorating bifurcated gonad tips and patches perdures ( Figure 6E , 240 6E” and 6C ) . The membranous cell fragment is not eliminated . However , LAG - 2 : : mNG protein 241 signal is no longer detected in this structure in more than half of adult animals ( Figure 6C ) , and 242 overall LAG - 2 : : mNG expression is significantly decreased in adult patches relative to L4 243 patches ( Figure 6F , magenta bar ) . The ced - 5 RNAi - treated animals maintain LAG - 2 : : mNG in 244 the DTC itself at levels indistinguishable from control DTCs ( Figure 6E’ and 6C ) , from which we 245 draw two conclusions . First , the loss of LAG - 2 : : mNG signal from the DTC fragment is not due to 246 a global failure of ced - 5 RNAi - treated animals to produce LAG - 2 : : mNG . Second , the DTC that 247 fragmented in the larval stage persists and is both morphologically and molecularly normal 248 hours to days after it breaks apart , suggesting a surprising capacity for cellular recovery in the 249 DTC ( Figure 6E’ , 6F ) . 250 251 Bifurcated germlines are mispatterned , with differentiating germ cells at the second tip 252 Since LAG - 2 : : mNG signal is reduced on the patch relative to the DTC in L4 and is reduced on 253 the surface of the patch in adults ( Figure 6F ) , we predicted that one branch of bifurcated gonads 254 would fail to support stem - like germ cells in later adulthood . We studied germline patterning in 255 6 branched gonads compared to controls using a germline - specific promoter - driven fluorescent 256 histone ( naSi2 ( mex - 5p : : H2B : : mCherry ) ) 74 to visualize the nuclear morphology of germ cells in 257 otherwise wild - type and ced - 5 ( n1812 ) mutant animals . 258 259 A wild - type adult hermaphrodite germline has a distinctive pattern of germ cell nuclear 260 morphology ( Figure 7A ) extending through the formation of oocytes ( Figure 7B ) . Distal germ 261 cells have small , uniform nuclei ( Figure 7C ) and visible mitotic figures ; these are the cells of the 262 proliferative zone . Proximal to these cells are cells of the transition zone , which have distinctive 263 crescent - shaped nuclear fluorescence ( Figure 7D ) ; these are at the leptotene / zygotene stage of 264 meiosis I 14 . Proximal to these cells are meiotic germ cells with “bowl of spaghetti” nuclear 265 morphology of meiotic pachytene 14 ( Figure 7E ) . As germ cells differentiate into oocytes , the 266 fluorescence signal reveals condensed bivalent chromosomes of diakinesis , and in DIC we 267 observe the cells becoming larger and more cytoplasm - rich ( Figure 7B - B” ) . 268 269 In branched gonads of 2 - day adults , imaging is complicated by the displacement deep into the 270 animal of one of the two gonad branches . However , in specimens in which both tips are visible , 271 we observe one normal looking branch with the expected distal - to - proximal pattern of 272 undifferentiated - to - differentiated germ cell nuclear morphology ( Figure 7F - H ) . In the second tip , 273 we consistently observed bulbous masses and disorganized H2B : : mCherry signal ( Figure 7F , I , 274 I’ ) . This includes H2B : : mCherry signal consistent with the condensing chromosomes of 275 oogenesis ( compare Figure 7I’ to 7B’ ) . A normal distal tip germline stem cell niche is not 276 maintained at the second tip , and germ cells appear to be differentiating in this tip . The 277 persistence of the branch despite the collapse of the ectopic niche suggests that the germ cells 278 do not flow from the branch into the “assembly line” of germline output , but instead differentiate 279 in place . 280 281 Aberrant patterning is also visible in younger branched gonads . In control L4 larvae ( Figure 282 S3A , S3C - D ) , most of the distal germline is proliferative , with meiotic transition zone nuclei 283 visible only near the bend . In the proximal germline , chromatin condenses for 284 spermatogenesis 14 , 75 . In branched gonads of ced - 5 ( n1812 ) L4 larvae undergoing 285 spermatogenesis ( Figure S3B ) , we observe two tubes of germ cells , one of which has the 286 expected patterning with undifferentiated mitotic cells distal ( Figure S3E ) . The second branch 287 tip , however , has germ cells with the crescent nuclear morphology typical of the transition zone 288 of meiotic prophase ( Figure S3F ) . While anatomically it is difficult to identify which is the distal 289 tip and which is the second branch at this stage ( see Figure 1 ) , germ cell nuclear morphology 290 reveals that only one branch maintains a stem - like population of germ cells . 291 292 As branched gonads lose LAG - 2 : : mNG signal on the patch membrane in adulthood , the germ 293 cells in the second branch become disorganized , lose stemness , and appear to differentiate 294 ( taking on crescent - shaped nuclear morphology or showing condensed bivalent chromosomes , 295 and making larger , blocky cells that resemble oocytes ) . We conclude that , while both DTC 296 fragments resulting from Rac - pathway ced loss - of - function are initially competent to lead gonad 297 growth via germ cell proliferation , the enucleate patch cannot sustain adult stem cell niche 298 activity . 299 300 DISCUSSION 301 During larval development , the C . elegans hermaphrodite DTC is both a leader cell and a stem 302 cell niche 1 and must coordinate cell - biological processes like cell signaling , basement 303 membrane secretion , and adhesion 4 to form a gonad arm populated by proliferating germ cells . 304 As a leader cell , it is non - protrusive , yet it has long been known that its proper migration 305 requires the canonical “leading edge” Rac pathway members CED - 10 / Rac1 , CED - 5 / DOCK180 , 306 7 CED - 2 / CrkII , and CED - 12 / ELMO . These factors play a role in polarity sensing 40 , however 307 defects in DTC migration polarity have not been reported to cause gonad bifurcation . We found 308 that without Rac pathway function , the DTC fragments during migration into two semi - equivalent 309 structures capable of leading gonad elongation and supporting germ cell proliferation , 310 sometimes driving gonad bifurcation . However , one structure lacks a nucleus and thus lacks the 311 ability to continue to produce LAG - 2 protein and thereby act as a stem cell niche through 312 adulthood . 313 314 Cell migration depends on major cytoskeletal rearrangements regulated by a complex network 315 of signal transduction pathways involving the Rho - family GTPases , including the highly 316 conserved ( in eukaryotes ) regulator of lamellipodial cell migration , Rac1 76 – 78 . Migrating cells 317 often form F - actin - rich protrusions at their leading edge , such as lamellipodia , filopodia , or 318 blebs 38 , 79 . The DTC curiously does not form protrusions during migration 4 , 35 . Nevertheless , DTC 319 migration defects have long been observed after loss of function of ced - 10 / Rac1 20 – 22 , 29 . 320 Migration events required for branching morphogenesis in the vertebrate lung , kidney , 321 mammary , and salivary glands are also driven by leader cells with a smooth leading edge 80 – 83 . 322 The mechanisms behind leader cell migration in these processes is largely unknown . Therefore , 323 elucidating regulators of DTC migration could provide a model for vertebrate organogenesis and 324 its misregulation , which occurs in certain cancers 84 . 325 326 Rac - pathway factors , including ced - 10 , play many important roles in C . elegans development 85 . 327 Rac pathway activity is essential for axon pathfinding 52 , 86 – 88 and dendrite regeneration 89 of 328 neurons . Rac pathway members have recently been discovered to interact with a CLIC chloride 329 channel protein during the formation of the excretory canal ( another tubular organ led by – and in 330 that case composed entirely of – a single cell ) 90 . Embryogenesis also requires ced - 10 / Rac in 331 several events , including epidermal cell intercalation 91 , 92 , gastrulation 93 , mitotic spindle 332 orientation 41 , and of course apoptotic cell corpse clearance 41 . It is not known whether loss - of - 333 function of ced - 10 / Rac or its GEF complex in these other contexts causes cell fragmentation . 334 335 Other C . elegans cells shed portions of themselves at other stages of development that are 336 cleared by entosis 94 . For example , membranous lobes are either trimmed away or left behind 337 after an entosis event in the primordial germ cells ( in a ced - 10 - dependent manner ) 95 and the 338 linker cell ( it is not known if this occurs in a Rho - GTPase - dependent manner ) 96 . However , these 339 cellular remodeling events are transient , and the residual bodies are eliminated by neighboring 340 cells , whereas the DTC patch is long - lasting and signal - active , at least for a time . 341 342 The dividing of a cell without DNA replication into functionally equivalent but genetically distinct 343 daughters ( meiosis notwithstanding ) is not unprecedented in animals . The superficial epithelial 344 cells of the larval zebrafish skin were recently discovered to divide after terminal differentiation 345 and produce hypoploid descendants 97 . Unlike DTC fragments , however , these descendants 346 each have reduced nuclear content but none lack a nucleus entirely . An example of mouse cells 347 fragmenting has recently been reported in the early embryo as a consequence of ectopic 348 activation of the polar body extrusion pathway in blastomeres 98 . The behavior of the DTC after 349 loss of Rac pathway activity is one of rather few documented instances of cell fragmentation 350 without cell death . How loss of Rac - pathway activity causes the DTC to fragment ( and why it 351 only sometimes drives gonad bifurcation ) are questions for future study . 352 353 The fragmented DTC more closely resembles mutant phenotypes observed in mouse 354 erythrocytes after loss of Rac pathway function . Rac1 - / - ; Rac2 - / - erythrocytes are fragmented and 355 misshapen , and these cells are experimentally determined to be less deformable than cells with 356 Rac1 expression 59 ( the best C . elegans BLAST hit of both mouse Rac1 and Rac2 is ced - 10 ) . 357 8 Rac1 also functions in human carcinoma cells to downregulate contractile myosin and make 358 cells more deformable ; Rac1 dominant - active cells outcompete Rac1 - deficient mutant cells via 359 entosis while its depletion causes cells to be stiffer and lose out to more deformable cells 60 . On 360 the other hand , in fibroblasts , Rac1 depletion leads to increased deformability 61 , so Rac1 361 function has a significant but not strictly directional influence on cell deformability . Taken 362 together , the existing literature and our results suggest that Rac1 is important for cells to 363 dynamically deform without breaking apart . We conclude that , although the DTC does not 364 undergo lamellipodial - driven migration , it nevertheless relies on CED - 10 / Rac1 to retain its 365 polarity , shape , and integrity at the tip of the growing gonad . Without Rac1 function when 366 cellular cohesion is lost and the cell breaks apart , each fragment can retain leader cell function 367 and support gonad elongation , suggesting that the nucleus is surprisingly dispensable for 368 completion of gonad growth , but is required for long - term maintenance of the stem cell niche . 369 370 METHODS 371 Sections of this text are adapted from Li et al . , 2022 99 , as they describe our standard laboratory 372 practices . 373 374 Strains 375 Some strains were provided by the CGC , which is funded by NIH Office of Research 376 Infrastructure Programs ( P40 OD010440 ) . In strain descriptions , we designate linkage to a 377 promoter with a p following the gene name and designate promoter fusions and in - frame fusions 378 with a double semicolon ( : : ) . Some integrated strains ( xxIs designation ) may still contain for 379 example the unc - 119 ( ed4 ) mutation and / or the unc - 119 rescue transgene in their genetic 380 background , but these are not listed in the strain description for the sake of concision , nor are 381 most transgene 3’ UTR sequences . Complete strain list in Key Resources Table . 382 383 Worm rearing 384 C . elegans strains were kept at 20°C unless otherwise described on standard NGM media and 385 fed E . coli OP50 . All animals assessed were hermaphrodites , as males have nonmigratory 386 DTCs . Worm populations were synchronized at L1 arrest for developmental staging by standard 387 egg preps 100 . 388 389 Confocal imaging 390 All images were acquired at room temperature on a Leica DMI8 with an xLIGHT V3 confocal 391 spinning disk head ( 89 North ) with a 63× Plan - Apochromat ( 1 . 4 NA ) objective and an 392 ORCAFusion GenIII sCMOS camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) controlled by microManager 101 . 393 RFPs were excited with a 555 nm laser , GFPs were excited with a 488 nm laser , and CFP was 394 excited by a 445 nm laser . Z - stacks through the gonad were acquired with a step - size of 1µm 395 unless otherwise noted . Worms were mounted on agar pads with 0 . 01 M sodium azide . 396 397 RNAi 398 E . coli HT115 ( DE3 ) containing the L4440 plasmid with or without a dsRNA trigger insert from 399 the Ahringer 102 or Vidal 103 RNAi libraries was grown as a single - colony overnight culture at 37°C , 400 expression induced with IPTG ( Apex BioResearch Products , cat # 20 - 109 ) for one hour at 37°C , 401 and was plated and allowed to grow at least overnight on NGM plates . Note , Ahringer ced - 10 402 clone number C09G12 . 8A has < 30 nt homology to the ced - 10 3’ UTR and yielded inconsistent 403 knockdown ; Vidal ced - 10 clone AAA28140 was used preferentially . Worm populations were 404 synchronized by bleaching according to a standard egg prep protocol 100 , plated on NGM plates 405 seeded with RNAi - expressing bacteria as arrested L1 larvae , and kept on RNAi until the time of 406 imaging . Whole - body RNAi treatment was conducted at 20°C , and DTC - specific RNAi treatment 407 was conducted at 16°C due to a temperature - sensitive rrf - 3 mutation in the DTC - specific RNAi 408 9 strain . Whole - body ced - 12 RNAi on the hlh - 2 ( ar623 [ gfp : : hlh - 2 ] ) strain included specimens 409 imaged after two generations on RNAi . 410 411 DTC - specific RNAi was performed using strain NK2115 65 , a genetic background carrying an 412 rde - 1 ( ne219 ) loss of function that prevents RNAi activity globally , with RNAi function restored in 413 the DTC ( in an operon along with a coding sequence for membrane - tethered mNeonGreen ) by 414 a transgene lag - 2p : : mNG : : PLC δPH : : F2A : : rde - 1 and a rrf - 3 ( pk1426 ) mutation that enhances 415 RNAi . 416 417 Image analysis 418 Images were processed in FIJI 104 ( Version : 2 . 14 . 1 / 1 . 54f ) , and images that required stitching 419 used the ImageJ Stitching Plugin 105 . Detailed descriptions of image analysis for different 420 experiments are provided below . 421 422 Measurement of DTC vs patch area 423 To compare the area of the WT DTC with the mutant DTC and enucleate patch , WT and mutant 424 gonads coexpressing the lag - 2p : : mNeonGreen : : PLC δPH membrane marker and lag - 425 2 : : P2A : : H2B : : mT2 nuclear marker were imaged with a 1 . 0 µm Z - step size . Only late L4 animals 426 were imaged for both WT and mutants and only mutants with a patch or bifurcation ( both 427 marked by a second focus of mNG expression ) were imaged . Late L4 animals were defined as 428 between the L4 . 6 - L4 . 9 larval stage , based on vulval morphology 106 . Using FIJI 104 , maximum 429 intensity z - projections were made through the depth of the entire DTC and patch structures . The 430 structures were outlined by hand ( based on membranous mNG signal in the GFP channel ) 431 using the freehand selections tool to define ROIs that corresponded to the boundary of the 432 structure . The area of these ROIs was then measured in µm 2 . 433 434 Fluorescence intensity of LAG - 2 : : mNeonGreen 435 For quantitative comparisons of fluorescence intensity shown in FIGURES , gonads were 436 imaged with uniform laser power and exposure times with 0 . 3 µm Z - steps . For the L4 stage , 437 only L4 . 6 - L4 . 9 ( late L4 ) animals were imaged , staged based on vulval morphology 106 . Young 438 Adults were identified as ~ 24h post the L4 stage and by the presence of some fertilized 439 embryos . Using FIJI 104 , sum - intensity z - projections were made through the depth of the focal 440 DTC and patch structures as visualized with the TdTomato signal in the RFP channel , excluding 441 deeper Z - slices with appearance of large , bright gut granules in the footprint of the DTC . The 442 structures were outlined with the Threshold function to make ROIs , and Mean Gray Value ( and 443 Raw Integrated Density ) were measured inside the ROI in arbitrary units . The same ROIs were 444 shifted onto worm gonad background and GFP fluorescence intensity was measured again . 445 This background was subtracted from the signal for the final value of LAG - 2 : : mNG detected in 446 the structure . In the ced - 5 RNAi group , only RNAi - treated specimens with patches or 447 bifurcations were analyzed ; escapers were discarded . Because different regions of the gonads 448 in adults are often in different focal planes , not every sample had both a visible DTC and a 449 visible patch . Along those lines , we measure lower LAG - 2 : : mNG signal in adult control and ced - 450 5 RNAi DTCs compared to L4 DTCs . We attribute this to imaging adult DTCs at a greater tissue 451 depth , which reduces signal capture , and with greater background autofluorescence in adults 452 relative to L4s . Patches in the adult , on the other hand , were usually on the surface of the gonad 453 and were never under the gut . We never observed adult DTCs ( either control or ced - 5 RNAi - 454 treated ) that lacked LAG - 2 : : mNG signal , while the patches of ced - 5 RNAi - treated adults lacked 455 noticeable signal in more than half of all samples . 456 457 458 459 10 Statistical analyses 460 Sample sizes , tests , test statistics , and p values are given for each analysis in the 461 accompanying figure legends .
