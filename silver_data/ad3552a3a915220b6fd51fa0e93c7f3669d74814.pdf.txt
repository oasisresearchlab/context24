Emergence and maintenance of variable - length actin Ô¨Ålaments in a limiting pool of building blocks Deb Sankar Banerjee 1 and Shiladitya Banerjee 1 , * 1 Carnegie Mellon University , Department of Physics , Pittsburgh , PA 15213 , USA * Correspondence : shiladtb @ andrew . cmu . edu ABSTRACT Actin is one of the key structural components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton that regulates cellular architecture and mechanical properties . Dynamic regulation of actin Ô¨Ålament length and organization is essential for the control of many physiological processes including cell adhesion , motility and division . While previous studies have mostly focused on the mechanisms controlling the mean length of individual actin Ô¨Ålaments , it remains poorly understood how distinct actin Ô¨Ålament populations in cells maintain diÔ¨Äerent lengths using the same set of molecular building blocks . Here we develop a theoretical model for the length regulation of multiple actin Ô¨Ålaments by nucleation and growth rate modulation by actin binding proteins in a limiting pool of monomers . We Ô¨Årst show that spontaneous nucleation of actin Ô¨Ålaments naturally leads to heterogeneities in Ô¨Ålament length distribution . We then investigate the eÔ¨Äects of Ô¨Ålament growth inhibition by capping proteins and growth promotion by formin proteins on Ô¨Ålament length distribution . We Ô¨Ånd that Ô¨Ålament length heterogeneity can be increased by growth inhibition , whereas growth promoters do not signiÔ¨Åcantly aÔ¨Äect length heterogeneity . Interestingly , a competition between Ô¨Ålament growth inhibitors and growth promoters can give rise to bimodal Ô¨Ålament length distribution as well as a highly heterogeneous length distribution with large statistical dispersion . We quantitatively predict how heterogeneity in actin Ô¨Ålament length can be modulated by tuning F - actin nucleation and growth rates in order to create distinct Ô¨Ålament subpopulations with diÔ¨Äerent lengths . SIGNIFICANCE Actin Ô¨Ålaments organize into diÔ¨Äerent functional network architectures within eukaryotic cells . To maintain distinct actin network architectures , it is essential to regulate the lengths of actin Ô¨Ålaments . While the mechanisms controlling the lengths of individual actin Ô¨Ålaments have been extensively studied , the regulation of length heterogeneity in actin Ô¨Ålament populations is not well understood . Here we show that the modulation of actin Ô¨Ålament growth and nucleation rates by actin binding proteins can regulate actin length distribution and create distinct sub - populations with diÔ¨Äerent lengths . In particular , by tuning concentrations of formin , proÔ¨Ålin and capping proteins , various aspects of actin Ô¨Ålament length distribution can be controlled . Insights gained from our results may have signiÔ¨Åcant implications for the regulation of actin Ô¨Ålament length heterogeneity and architecture within a cell . INTRODUCTION In eukaryotic cells , actin Ô¨Ålament growth and turnover are tightly regulated for coordinating a diverse set of physiologi - cal processes including cell motility ( 1 ‚Äì 3 ) , protrusion forma - tion ( 4 ‚Äì 6 ) , endocytosis ( 7 ) , wound healing ( 8 , 9 ) , synaptic activity ( 10 ) , cytokinesis ( 11 , 12 ) , and embryonic develop - ment ( 13 ‚Äì 16 ) . These diÔ¨Äerent functions often require distinct subpopulations of actin Ô¨Ålaments organized into diÔ¨Äerent lengths and architectures ( 17 ) . Study of length control mech - anisms of intracellular structures has been an active area of research . Traditionally , these studies mostly focus on under - standing the physical principle and molecular mechanism that give rise to structures of a typical length ( 18 ‚Äì 23 ) , with a relatively narrow length distribution . The origin of length heterogeneity and the mechanisms to create and maintain a heterogeneous population is not well understood . Here we study mechanisms of controlling heterogeneity in length of a population of actin Ô¨Ålaments . The molecular processes underlying actin Ô¨Ålament growth have been extensively studied both theoretically and experi - mentally . Existing models for actin Ô¨Ålament growth can be categorized into two main classes according to the avail - ability of monomers ( 24 ) : growth in an open system where the monomer concentration remains unchanged in time , and growth in a closed system where free monomer concentration decreases as Ô¨Ålaments increase in length ( keeping the total amount of monomers conserved ) . Length control mechanisms have been proposed for actin Ô¨Ålaments in both the above cases to understand how Ô¨Ålaments of a typical length can be achieved ( 22 , 25 ‚Äì 27 ) . But , how Ô¨Ålaments of diÔ¨Äerent lengths can be obtained is much less understood ( 28 ) . This is relevant for a cell where actin Ô¨Ålaments are found in a wide diversity of lengths . In this study we consider actin Ô¨Ålament growth in a closed system , where the monomer pool is limited ( 29 ) . Though it is not well established if in vivo actin systems can be considered to be assembled from a limiting monomer pool , recent studies show that diÔ¨Äerent actin structures in a cell often compete for the same limiting pool of monomeric Banerjee and Banerjee actin ( 30 , 31 ) . In this study , we use theory and simulations to demonstrate how actin Ô¨Ålament length heterogeneity can be regulated and we demonstrate how distinct actin Ô¨Ålament subpopulations may emerge in a limiting pool of monomers and actin binding proteins , speciÔ¨Åcally formin , proÔ¨Ålin and capping proteins . Since we limit our study to interactions between actin and only a few actin regulatory proteins , the results from our theoretical model can be best captured with an in vitro experimental system , where the concentrations of actin and its regulatory proteins can be precisely controlled . Previous theoretical studies have shown that nucleation and polymerization of actin Ô¨Ålaments in a limiting monomer pool results in an exponential length distribution at steady - state ( 24 , 32 ‚Äì 34 ) , with the standard deviations in length Ô¨Çuctuations as large as the mean . The timescale for reaching such a steady - state length distribution is found to be > 3 hours in vitro ( 32 , 35 ) , while simulations predicted the timescale to be on the order of days ( 26 , 33 , 34 ) under physiological conditions ( e . g . , cell volume ‚àº 1000 ùúáùëö 3 and total monomer concentration 20 ‚àí 100 ùúá M ) , making the steady - state length distribution less relevant for many of the physiological pro - cesses that occur within a timescale of minutes to hours . It has been previously shown that the dynamics of actin length distri - bution can be segregated into a fast regime of nucleation and growth , and a slow regime of length rearrangement between actin Ô¨Ålaments via exchanging monomers ( 33 ) . In the initial regime , the length distribution dynamics has a convective nature ( mean of the distribution increases ) , while in the later regime the Ô¨Ålament lengths undergo a diÔ¨Äusive dynamics ( variance increases keeping mean constant ) ( 33 ) ( Fig S1 ) . We are , however , interested in actin length distribution during an intermediate regime where the number of Ô¨Ålaments and the mean Ô¨Ålament length has reached a steady state . This intermediate regime is attained within minutes and the re - sulting length distribution remains approximately invariant over a timescales of hours , making it physiologically rele - vant as many actin structures such as Ô¨Ålopodia , lamellipodia turns over within or before an hour ( 36 ‚Äì 38 ) . In this regime , the growth of the actin Ô¨Ålament population can be regulated by both spontaneous Ô¨Ålament nucleation and actin binding proteins such as formin , proÔ¨Ålin and capping proteins . It is important to note that actin Ô¨Ålament turnover by spontaneous fragmentation , annealing , and coÔ¨Ålin - mediated severing may aÔ¨Äect the long - time actin dynamics in an actin concentration - dependent manner , thereby altering the time evolution of Ô¨Ålament length distribution . Here we do not consider such eÔ¨Äects and restrict our study to smaller actin concentrations , focusing on timescales short compared to the timescales over which fragmentation or annealing eÔ¨Äects become prominent ( see Methods ) . We show that spontaneous nucleation of actin Ô¨Ålaments and interactions with speciÔ¨Åc actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) can induce signiÔ¨Åcant heterogeneity in actin Ô¨Ålament length , persisting for several hours . We speciÔ¨Åcally study the eÔ¨Äects of growth promoting ABPs like formin and growth inhibiting ABPs like capping proteins on the regulation of actin Ô¨Ålament length distribution . We show that formin and capping protein concentrations can be tuned to regulate the heterogeneity in actin Ô¨Ålament length in the Ô¨Ålament population . In particular , we Ô¨Ånd that formin and capping proteins , when present in similar concentrations , can give rise to a bimodal length distribution that represent two distinct subpopulations of long and short actin Ô¨Ålaments . METHODS Computational model We Ô¨Årst describe the computational model for the nucleation and growth of actin Ô¨Ålaments in the presence of actin binding proteins . All the chemical reactions involved in F - actin growth and nucleation are listed in Fig . 1 , with the parameter values given in Table . 1 . We use a stochastic reaction network frame - work based on Gillespie‚Äôs Ô¨Årst algorithm ( 39 ) to simulate the length dynamics of actin Ô¨Ålaments . Spontaneous nucleation of actin Ô¨Ålaments involves sequential formation of polymeriza - tion intermediates , actin dimers and trimers , with the trimers acting as the seed for nucleation ( 40 ‚Äì 42 ) ( Reactions 2 - 5 in Fig . 1 and Fig . 2a ) . We consider the growth of Ô¨Ålamentous actin ( F - actin ) via association and dissociation of globular actin ( G - actin ) from the barbed end ( Reaction 6 in Fig . 1 and Fig . 2a ) , with the association and dissociation rates ùêæ on and ùêæ oÔ¨Ä ( see Supplemental Methods ) . For simplicity , we do not consider the nucleotide state of the monomers in the Ô¨Ålament and assume that free monomers in the pool are ATP - bound . In the presence of capping proteins , the Ô¨Ålament growth dynamics are described by Reactions 2 - 6 and Reaction 15 ( Fig . 1 ) . The capping bound Ô¨Ålaments do not add or lose any monomers ( i . e . , ùêæ on , ùêæ oÔ¨Ä = 0 ) and remain unchanged in length . Here we have ignored the assembly dynamics via pointed end of the F - actin and we shall discuss the eÔ¨Äect of pointed end growth later in the study . In the presence of proÔ¨Ålin and formin , the growth dynamics are given by Reactions 1 - 14 and Reaction 16 ( Fig . 1 ) . For simplicity , we Ô¨Årst adopt an eÔ¨Äective description where formin - bound Ô¨Ålaments assemble with increased rate , given by ùêæ on = ùõºùêæ + [ ùê¥ 1 ] and disassemble with the same rate as the free barbed end ( Fig . 4 ) . Later , we discuss the eÔ¨Äect of proÔ¨Ålin and formin - mediated nucleation on Ô¨Ålament length dynamics ( Fig . 5 ) . To simulate the combined eÔ¨Äect of capping , formin and proÔ¨Ålin proteins on actin Ô¨Ålament growth , we used an eÔ¨Äective description ( Reactions 2 - 6 and 15 - 18 in Fig . 1 ) in Fig . 6 and a complete description using all the reactions ( 1 - 18 in Fig . 1 ) is presented in Fig S9 . The dimer and proÔ¨Ålin - actin dynamics ( Reaction 1 and 2 in Fig . 1 ) are computed using deterministic evolution of concentration of the constituent reactants . We evolve the deter - ministic equations multiple times to attain equilibrium dimer and proÔ¨Ålin - actin concentration between two stochastically chosen reactions ùúè time apart .

The corresponding rate constants and parameters are listed in Tables 1 and Table 2 . ics is similar to previous studies ( 34 ) . Deterministic evolution of these reactions were adopted to avoid the computationally costly simulation of dimers and proÔ¨Ålin - actin dynamics . The Ô¨Ålament length distributions presented in this study are computed from the Ô¨Ålament length recorded during the last one minute of the simulation , unless speciÔ¨Åed otherwise . For most of the study , we consider a representative system with total actin concentration 10 ùúá M and system volume 200 ùúá m 3 . In our study we have not taken spontaneous fragmentation and annealing of Ô¨Ålaments into account as these slow processes may not aÔ¨Äect the early time ( ‚àº 30 min ) dynamics of Ô¨Ålament length at 10 ùúá M actin concentration . It is also not well under - stood how spontaneous fragmentation and annealing aÔ¨Äect actin Ô¨Ålament growth dynamics in vivo ( 43 ) , and in vitro in the presence of other actin binding proteins . There are conÔ¨Çicting reports from in vitro experiments showing exponential ( 32 ) and unimodal - like ( 44 ) size distribution of actin Ô¨Ålaments , observed over a few hours in the absence of any other actin binding proteins . .

The dimers and the trimers have a high dissociation rate , making spontaneous nucleation of actin Ô¨Ålaments an ineÔ¨Écient process . In addition , the actin binding protein proÔ¨Ålin is known to suppress spontaneous actin nucleation in vivo . However , spontaneous Ô¨Ålament assem - bly may play a signiÔ¨Åcant role in vitro situations where only actin is present , or when proÔ¨Ålin and formin concentrations are relatively low compared to actin .

( f ) Filament length and age are highly correlated in presence of spontaneous nucleation . ( inset ) The emergent correlation is long - lived and remains almost unaltered for hours . We have used 100 ensembles to produce the length distribution and related statistical quantities .

The instantaneous monomer density ùúå av is given by ùúå av = ùúå 0 ‚àí 1 ùëâ (cid:205) ùëõ ùëì ùëñ = 1 ùëõ ùëñ where ùúå 0 is the total actin concentration , ùëâ is the system volume , ùëõ ùëñ is the length of the ùëñ ùë°‚Ñé Ô¨Ålament ( in monomer numbers ) , and ùëõ ùëì is the number of actin Ô¨Ålaments . The growth of all the Ô¨Ålaments can be described by a set of such master equations written according to the polymerization kinetics deÔ¨Åned in Fig . 1 and Fig . 2a . With the parameters listed in Table 2 , the nucleation pro - cess ends within a few minutes and the mean Ô¨Ålament length reaches equilibrium in 10 - 15 min . Over longer timescales , the Ô¨Ålaments can only exchange monomers with other Ô¨Åla - ments via disassembly and assembly , such that the Ô¨Ålament population dwells in a long - lived dynamic state . In the absence of spontaneous nucleation , when there is a Ô¨Åxed number of Ô¨Ålaments simultaneously growing from a limiting monomer pool ( i . e . , instantaneous nucleation ) , the resulting length distribution is narrow with a very small coeÔ¨Écient of variation that is maintained over a timescale of 30 min to few hours ( Fig . 2b ) . This early - time length distribution then evolves to become broader , keeping the mean length constant . The distribution eventually becomes exponential over a very long timescale of several days ( Fig . 2b ) . Thus Length regulation of actin Ô¨Ålaments having a large enough G - actin pool can be suÔ¨Écient to achieve a well regulated length for multiple Ô¨Ålaments growing from a shared subunit pool , which is maintained over physiologically relevant timescales of tens of minutes to a few hours . By contrast , the length distribution is signiÔ¨Åcantly broader when the Ô¨Ålaments nucleate via spontaneous formation of trimer seeds ( Fig . 2c ) , with all other conditions being the same . The mean length is the same in both cases ( Fig . 2d ) as it is a property of the pool size and growth rates . This broadness of length distribution originates from the heterogeneity in length in the Ô¨Ålament population ( Fig . 2e ) and not from temporal Ô¨Çuctuations in individual Ô¨Ålament length ( see Fig . S2 ) . Emergence of Ô¨Ålament length heterogeneity can be un - derstood from the interplay between sequential nucleation of Ô¨Ålaments and their subsequent growth . After nucleation , Ô¨Ålaments start growing with a growth rate proportional to the instantaneous monomer pool density and all Ô¨Ålaments keep growing until the monomer pool density has reached the critical value ùêæ ‚àí / ùêæ + (cid:39) 0 . 12 ùúá M . Thus , the Ô¨Ålaments that nucleated earlier attain a much larger length compared to the Ô¨Ålaments that are nucleated later ( see Movie S1 ) . Once the monomer density has reached its critical value , the Ô¨Åla - ments can only change their length by exchanging monomers between each other . This diÔ¨Äusive process of length rear - rangement is very slow for a large actin pool . This leads to the long - lived dynamic state that retains the heterogeneity in Ô¨Ålament length . This consequently results in Ô¨Ålament length being correlated with their age ( Fig . 2f ) , which is retained for a very long time ( Fig . 2f , inset ) . This age - length correlation is noteworthy because it presents a possible regulatory mech - anism where ABPs ( such as ADF / coÔ¨Ålin ) that interact with Ô¨Ålaments in an age - dependent manner ( 50 ) ( e . g . , nucleotide phosphorylation state dependent ) can exploit this correlation to build a length - dependent regulation of Ô¨Ålament growth . The length heterogeneity decreases ( increases ) with increas - ing ( decreasing ) rate of nucleation , as we have shown by changing dimer production rate ( see Fig . S2 ) . Thus , cellular processes that can aÔ¨Äect the nucleation rate can regulate the length heterogeneity of the resulting Ô¨Ålament population . It is important to note that the timescale of relaxation of Ô¨Ålament length distribution ( shown in Fig . 2b ) is much diÔ¨Äerent in a cell where numerous factors contribute to faster turnover of actin Ô¨Ålaments . Spontaneous fragmentation and annealing of actin Ô¨Ålaments , observed in in vitro systems ( 32 ) , may also decrease this relaxation timescale . However , the rates of fragmentation and annealing being very small ( order of 10 ‚àí 7 ùúá M / s ) ( 32 ) , length relaxation via fragmentation and annealing will take much longer than the typical timescales associated with the turnover of actin - based structures ( ‚àº 30 min - 1 hr ) . F - actin capping increases Ô¨Ålament length heterogeneity We next investigate how the length distribution of actin Ô¨Ål - aments are regulated by actin binding proteins that inhibit Ô¨Ålament growth . Capping proteins ( CP ) act as F - actin growth inhibitors by binding to F - actin barbed ends and blocking the assembly and disassembly of monomers from that end ( Fig . 3a ) ( 51 , 52 ) . Here capping proteins are modeled as coarse - grained moieties that associate F - actin barbed ends at a rate ùêæ + ùê∂ and dissociate at a rate ùêæ ‚àí ùê∂ ( Reaction 15 in Fig . 1 ) . Capping - bound Ô¨Ålaments will stall Ô¨Ålament growth ( ùêæ + , ùêæ ‚àí ‚Üí 0 ) until the capping protein unbinds . We have used Reactions 2 - 6 and Reaction 15 ( Fig . 1 ) to model the eÔ¨Äect of capping proteins , with parameters benchmarked for the well studied capping protein CapZ ( Table 1 ) . In presence of capping proteins , the mean Ô¨Ålament length decreases ( Fig . 3b ) with increasing capping concentration ( ùúå ùëê ) . The mean length ( ¬Ø ùêø ) is approximately inversely proportional to ùúå ùëê ( Fig . 3c - inset ) . The reduction in average length of F - actin with increasing CapZ concentration cannot be explained without considering the eÔ¨Äect of capping proteins on Ô¨Ålament nucleation . By inhibiting the growth of the nucleated Ô¨Ålaments , the capping proteins induce a slower depletion of the monomer pool and promote nucleation of more Ô¨Ålaments ( Fig . 3c ) . The Ô¨Ålament density increases approximately linearly with increasing capping concentration ( Fig . 3c ) . This increase in Ô¨Ålament abundance decreases the mean length of the Ô¨Ålament population . In the absence of spontaneous Ô¨Ålament nucleation ( i . e . , growing a Ô¨Åxed number of Ô¨Ålaments ) , capping proteins can only slow down the growth of the existing Ô¨Ålaments . This will lead to the same mean Ô¨Ålament length and cannot explain a permanent decrease in average length ( Fig . S3 ) . The Ô¨Ålament length distribution loses the unimodal nature in the presence of capping proteins by becoming exponential ( Fig . 3d ) , with the coeÔ¨Écient of variation in length approach - ing 1 ( Fig . 3e ) . This heterogeneity in length does not arise from exchange of monomers between Ô¨Ålaments . Rather , the capping proteins slow down the Ô¨Ålament rearrangement dy - namics in the diÔ¨Äusive growth regime even further ( Fig . S3 ) . The exponential length distribution arises from the interplay between the initial growth of Ô¨Ålaments and the dynamics of capping protein binding to the newly created Ô¨Ålaments . In the initial period of growth , the Ô¨Ålament length grows almost linearly and the waiting time for capping binding to occur has an exponential distribution ( as the binding reaction is a Poisson process , independent of Ô¨Ålament length ) . Thus at high enough capping concentration , the Ô¨Ålaments captured by the capping proteins will acquire an exponential length distribution . The capping unbinding rate being slow , this nucleation - growth - capture process will deplete the monomer pool and give rise to a long - lived state with large length heterogeneity and an exponential distribution ( Movie S2 ) . The process of nucleation - growth - capture does not preserve the information of Ô¨Ålament age in their length ( Fig . 3f ) . The capping proteins bind to all free barbed ends with equal prob - ability regardless of the Ô¨Ålament age . Hence the diÔ¨Äerence in Ô¨Ålament length emerging previously from the diÔ¨Äerence in their age , cannot be retained in the presence of capping proteins .

For additional parameter values see Table 1 and Table 2 . diminish with increasing capping concentration ( Fig . 3f ) . In summary , growth inhibition by capping protein en - hances heterogeneity in length and we do not observe the long - lived unimodal length distribution that resulted with spontaneous F - actin nucleation ( Fig . 2c ) . Our results are in good agreement with the experimentally measured dynamics of mean Ô¨Ålament length ( 35 , 53 ) , length distribution ( 35 ) and Ô¨Ålament nucleation ( 54 ) in the presence of capping proteins . While we neglected actin assembly from the pointed end , pointed - end assembly qualitatively changes actin length dis - tribution in the presence of capping proteins ( Fig . S4 ) . In particular , pointed end assembly increases the mean Ô¨Ålament length , introduces a peak in the length distribution , while retaining the exponential tail of the distribution . Role of Formin on F - actin length control Assembly of actin Ô¨Ålaments in cells is enhanced by growth promoting factors such as formin proteins that bind to the barbed end of the F - actin Ô¨Ålament , increasing F - actin poly - merization rate up to a few folds ( 55 , 56 ) . Formin proteins not only regulate F - actin organization ( 30 ) and actomyosin dy - namics ( 57 ) , but also play important roles in cell motility ( 58 ) and cell adhesion ( 59 ) . While many diÔ¨Äerent types of formins with varied eÔ¨Äects on barbed end assembly rate are present in cells , we parametrize our simulations based on mDia1 ( 49 ) . We model formins as coarse - grained moieties that bind to the barbed end of F - actin at a rate ùêæ + ùêπ and dissociate at a rate ùêæ ‚àí ùêπ ( Fig . 4a ) , with ùêæ ‚àí ùêπ (cid:28) ùêæ + ùêπ . Formin proteins act as growth promoters in the presence of proÔ¨Ålin proteins .

( a ) Schematic diagram of formin binding to F - actin barbed ends , leading to an increase in polymerization rate . ( b ) The mean Ô¨Ålament length increases with increasing formin concentration . ( c ) The Ô¨Ålament number density decreases with increasing formin concentration as promotion of Ô¨Ålament growth depletes the monomer pool quicker , leaving less monomers for nucleation . ( inset ) Increasing Ô¨Ålament mean length saturates at higher formin concentration as the Ô¨Ålament number density saturates . ( d - e ) Enhanced polymerization of F - actin by formin retains the unimodality of the Ô¨Ålament length distribution but the mean increases . The length heterogeneity is non - monotonic , increasing at lower formin concentration while decreasing later at higher formin concentration . The non - monotonic change in coeÔ¨Écient of variation captures the increased heterogeneity in length at small formin concentration . The color code is same as shown in panel - b . ( f ) The correlation between Ô¨Ålament age and length is non - monotonic , with a decrease at an intermediate range of formin concentrations . We have used 100 ensembles and collected length for the last one minute to produce the length distribution and related quantities . For additional parameter values see Table . 1 and Table . 2 . for proÔ¨Ålins . In this simpliÔ¨Åed model , formin - mediated elon - gation is captured via an enhanced assembly rate ùõºùêæ + , with ùõº > 1 ( 55 , 56 ) , allowing us to study the eÔ¨Äect of increased elongation rate on Ô¨Ålament length distribution . For simplic - ity , we also neglect the eÔ¨Äects of formin - mediated F - actin nucleation . This is a reasonable assumption for some types of formins ( e . g . , DAAM1 , FMNL2 and FMNL3 ) that have a very low eÔ¨Éciency of nucleating Ô¨Ålaments ( ‚àº 1 % ) and rather promote barbed end elongation at a higher rate ( 60 ‚Äì 63 ) . We use Reactions ( 2 ) - ( 6 ) and Reaction ( 16 ) ( Fig . 1 ) to model Ô¨Ålament growth driven by formin - mediated elongation in the Ô¨Årst part of this section ( Fig . 4a ) . We study the role of proÔ¨Ålin and formin - mediated nucleation later in this section , where we use Reactions ( 1 ) - ( 14 ) and Reaction ( 16 ) ( Fig . 1 ) to model the Ô¨Ålament growth in the presence of both proÔ¨Ålin and formin . Role of Formin - mediated elongation ‚Äì We Ô¨Ånd that the mean length ( ¬Ø ùêø ) of growing actin Ô¨Ålaments increase with increasing formin concentration ( Fig . 4b ) , while eventually saturating at higher values of formin concentration ( Fig . 4c - inset ) . This sat - uration of mean length occurs as nucleated Ô¨Ålaments remain formin - bound most of the time at high formin concentration , making the eÔ¨Äective actin assembly rate ‚àº ùõºùêæ + . Presence of formins can change the critical concentration for actin growth in a concentration - dependent manner ( see Fig . S5 ) . Depending on the change in elongation rate mediated by dif - ferent types of formin proteins , the critical concentration may increase or decrease compared to the critical concentration in the presence of only actin . However , these estimates of critical concentration are based on our eÔ¨Äective description may not accurately capture the critical concentration in real experimental systems where non - equilibrium processes regu - late various aspects of actin assembly . The enhanced growth of the formin - bound Ô¨Ålaments leads to an accelerated deple - tion of the monomer pool , thereby suppressing spontaneous nucleation . Filament density decreases with increasing formin Banerjee and Banerjee concentration , approximately scaling inversely ( Fig . 4c ) . With increasing formin concentration , Ô¨Ålament length distribution shifts to a higher mean but remains unimodal and qualitatively similar to the case without formin ( Fig . 4d ) . At high enough formin concentration , formins strongly pro - mote growth of the Ô¨Ålaments , preserving the unimodality of length distribution without increasing length heterogene - ity ( Fig . 4d , e and Movie S3 ) . However , the coeÔ¨Écient of variation in Ô¨Ålament length changes non - monotonically with formin concentration , indicating higher heterogeneity at lower formin concentration ( Fig . 4e ) . This increased heterogeneity in length is caused by the competition between formin - bound and free Ô¨Ålaments in absence of enough formins to bind all the Ô¨Ålaments that are being nucleated ( see Fig . S5 ) . This non - monotonicity is also present in the correlation between Ô¨Ålament length and age , with a loss of correlation at small formin concentration , while regaining the correlation back at higher concentration of formins ( Fig . 4f ) . The similarity in length - age correlation at high and low formin concentrations arises from the fact that at high formin concentration the actin growth can be eÔ¨Äectively represented as growth of only F - actin with an enhanced assembly rate ( ‚àº ùõºùêæ + ) . Role of proÔ¨Ålin and Formin - mediated nucleation ‚Äì Formin is known to increase the assembly rate of F - actin in the presence of proÔ¨Ålin proteins that bind to actin monomers to create a proÔ¨Ålin - actin ( PA ) pool ( 64 ) . PA selectively takes part in the assembly of formin - bound Ô¨Ålaments with higher assembly rate . In the above , we did not explicitly consider proÔ¨Ålin dynamics and implicitly assumed that formin - bound Ô¨Ålaments incorporate PA to increase their assembly rates . We also assumed that spontaneous nucleation can proceed in the presence of proÔ¨Ålin . These assumptions are reasonable if the amount of actin monomers is much larger than proÔ¨Ålin - actin amount in the pool . Actin - proÔ¨Ålin ratios in cells are typically larger than 2 : 1 ( 45 ) , leaving enough free monomers for spontaneous nucleation in the beginning . However , with the growth of formin - bound Ô¨Ålaments the proÔ¨Ålin - actin subunits quickly become dominant over free actin monomers . To study the role of proÔ¨Ålin - actin on F - actin length con - trol , we explicitly modeled proÔ¨Ålins and their interaction with actin ( Fig . 1 ) . In addition , we modeled irreversible dimer formation ( from either two G - actin or one G - actin and one proÔ¨Ålin - actin ) by formins at a rate ùêæ FN ( see Supplemental Methods for details ) to study the role of formin - mediated nucleation on F - actin length distribution . We considered three diÔ¨Äerent proÔ¨Ålin concentrations of 2 ùúá M , 5 ùúá M and 10 ùúá M , corresponding to the physiologically relevant actin - proÔ¨Ålin ratios 5 : 1 , 2 : 1 , and 1 : 1 , respectively . We Ô¨Ånd that the mean Ô¨Ålament length shows a non - monotonic dependence on formin concentration , results from a competition between sponta - neous nucleation and formin - mediated F - actin nucleation ( Fig . 5a ) . Filament length is maximum at an intermediate formin concentration , when formin - mediated nucleation is not prevalent but most of the Ô¨Ålaments are formin - bound and grow to be large . At a Ô¨Åxed formin concentration , mean length increases with increasing proÔ¨Ålin concentrations due to less spontaneous nucleation and faster elongation rate of formin - bound Ô¨Ålaments ( Fig . 5a , b ) . While the length distributions are more spread - out at higher actin - proÔ¨Ålin ratios ( Fig . 5b ) , length heterogeneity remains almost invariant for changing formin concentration and actin - proÔ¨Ålin ratio . At very low formin concentration , length heterogeneity is high due to competing subpopulations of Ô¨Ålaments with formin - bound and free barbed ends ( Fig . 5c and Fig . S6 ) . At high proÔ¨Ålin concentrations ( 10 ùúá M with actin - proÔ¨Ålin concentration ratio 1 : 1 ) , the mean length decreases with increasing formin con - centration as more Ô¨Ålaments are created via formin - mediated nucleation ( Fig . 5d ) . As reported in previous studies ( 48 ) , a stronger formin - mediated nucleation leads to an increase in Ô¨Ålament density ( Fig . 5e ) and a reduction in mean Ô¨Ålament length ( Fig . 5f ) with increasing formin concentration . At lower formin concentrations and smaller rate of formin - mediated nu - cleation , ùêæ FN , mean Ô¨Ålament length increases due to reduced nucleation of Ô¨Ålaments ( see Fig . S7 & S8 ) . This is similar to the case where formins act eÔ¨Äectively as growth promoters ( Fig . 4 ) . Overall , our results predict the eÔ¨Äects of Ô¨Ålament elon - gation and nucleation by formins on the emergent length distribution of actin Ô¨Ålaments . The predicted Filament length dynamics in the presence of formin - mediated nucleation ( Fig . 5 ) are in good agreement with the recently reported role of formin in limiting actin Ô¨Ålament length in an in vitro as - say ( 48 ) . The results from our eÔ¨Äective description of formins as growth promoters ( Fig . 4 ) may be relevant in vivo where formin - mediated nucleation often requires other co - factors or nucleation promoting factors . In the absence of such cofactors , formins only play an essential role in barbed - end elongation . For mDia1 the co - factor required for nucleation is adenoma - teous polyposis coli ( APC ) and without APC , mDia1 hardly nucleates new Ô¨Ålaments in the presence of proÔ¨Ålin ( 65 ) . Competition between Formin and Capping proteins results in bimodal F - actin length distribution In the previous sections , we studied how F - actin growth inhibitors and growth promoters maintain Ô¨Ålament length heterogeneity and retain unimodality of length distribution . Here we study their combined eÔ¨Äect on Ô¨Ålament growth and length control . To model the interactions between formin and capping proteins , we adopt an eÔ¨Äective description for formin - driven F - actin elongation as before ( Reactions 2 ‚àí 6 , 15 ‚àí 18 in Fig . 1 ) , without explicitly accounting for proÔ¨Ålin and formin - mediated nucleation . Formin and capping proteins both compete for the F - actin barbed end and this competition was previously thought to be exclusive ( 66 ) . Recent studies ( 49 , 67 ) have uncovered the interaction between free formins ( F ) and capping bound to Ô¨Ålaments ( BC ) and vice - versa .

For additional parameter values see Tables 1 and 2 . ternary complex , referred to as BFC or BCF depending on the order of the complex formation ( Fig . 6a ) . For instance , capping protein binding to a formin - bound barbed end forms a BFC complex , while formin binding to a capping - bound barbed end forms a BCF complex . These complexes can disassemble in two diÔ¨Äerent ways leaving the barbed end either formin - bound or capping - bound ( Fig . 6a ) . The disassembly rate of this complex is larger than the very small disassembly rate of capping and formin proteins from the barbed end ( Table 1 ) . Thus this interaction enables actin Ô¨Ålaments to switch from a capping - bound non - growing state to a formin - bound fast growing state . By varying the amount of formin and capping proteins , we Ô¨Ånd four distinct types of F - actin length distributions that emerge via the interaction of capping and formin proteins with the F - actin Ô¨Ålaments ( Fig . 6b ) . When formin concentration is considerably higher than the capping protein concentration , the resulting length distribution is unimodal ( Fig . 6c ) . Here , the formin proteins outcompete the eÔ¨Äect of capping proteins and retain unimodality of length distribution . We Ô¨Ånd the characteristic exponential length distribution emerging from capping - induced inhibition of F - actin growth , but this eÔ¨Äect fades away in the presence of even small amount of formin ( Fig . 6b ) . In the regionwhere concentration ofcapping proteins is much higher than formin proteins we Ô¨Ånd that the Ô¨Ålament population has a high amount of heterogeneity in length and the coeÔ¨Écient of variation is large ( ùê∂ùëâ > 1 ) ( Fig . 6b and Fig . 6e ) . We refer to these length distributions with power - law tails followed by an eventual exponential decay ( Fig . 6e , Fig . S9 ) as fat - tailed distributions . This broadness in length distribution appears where amount of capping is higher than formin but it is noteworthy that capping proteins alone cannot produce such high amount of heterogeneity in length and the competition between capping and formin proteins plays a role Banerjee and Banerjee ( a ) ( b ) Formin CP G - actin + + BC BF BCF BFC C P F o r m i n BC BF + C P F o r m i n + 1 2 3 4 [ CP ] ( nM ) [ F o r m i n ] ( n M ) Fat - tailed Exponential Unimodal Bimodal C V = 0 . 35 C V = 0 . 8 CV 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 05 [ CP ] = 2 . 5 nM , [ Formin ] = 5 nM 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 05 [ CP ] = 0 . 5 nM , [ Formin ] = 25 nM 10 - 1 10 0 10 - 4 10 - 2 10 0 [ CP ] = 25 nM , [ Formin ] = 10 nM 30 min 5 hr10 hr Bimodal Unimodal Fat - tailed - 0 . 8 ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) [ CP ] ( nM ) [ F o r m i n ] ( n M ) 10 20 30 40 0 40 80 20 10 0 filaments 0 40 80 20 10 0 B BF BC BCF / BFC t = 8 s t = 14 s filaments ( f ) ( g ) ( h ) U n i m oda l P ( L ) P ( L ) P ( L ) L / L _ L / L _ L / L _ L ( Œº m ) L ( Œº m ) L ( Œº m ) Figure 6 : Emergence of bimodal F - actin length distribution by competition between formin and capping proteins .

( h ) Mean Ô¨Ålament length as a function of formin and capping protein concentrations . Increasing formin ( capping ) concentration increases ( decreases ) the mean length of the Ô¨Ålament population . Additional parameter values are given in Table 1 and Table 2 . in promoting this large heterogeneity in length . When formin and capping protein concentrations are com - parable , we see the emergence of a bimodal length distribution , where the Ô¨Ålament population has two clearly segregated sub - populations of small and large Ô¨Ålaments ( Fig . 6b and Fig . 6d ) . The bimodal length distribution is long - lived , being stable without any signiÔ¨Åcant changes over a timescale of tens of minutes to tens of hours ( Fig . 6d ) . The origin of the bimodal - ity lies in the early time segregation of Ô¨Ålaments either by growth promoters in the subpopulation of large Ô¨Ålaments or Length regulation of actin Ô¨Ålaments by growth inhibitors in the subpopulation of small Ô¨Ålaments ( Fig . 6f - g and Movie S4 ) . These segregated subpopulations are stable over a timescale of many hours , as the monomer pool reaches critical concentration when it is in equilibrium with the Ô¨Ålaments . After this initial period of growth , formin and capping proteins cannot signiÔ¨Åcantly alter the Ô¨Ålament length distribution , as in this long - lived diÔ¨Äusive growth regime a small Ô¨Ålament cannot grow fast to become large even if it is formin - bound . In addition to modulating the nature of length distributions , the mean length of the Ô¨Ålament population can also be tuned by changing formin and capping protein con - centrations ( Fig . 6h ) . Increase in formin concentration and decrease in capping protein concentration increases the mean Ô¨Ålament length as expected from the results of the previous sections . We tested the validity of our assumption of neglecting the role of proÔ¨Ålin and formin - mediated nucleation by explicitly modeling these eÔ¨Äects . Our results show that the qualitative na - ture of the Ô¨Ålament length distribution and the phase diagram do not change in the presence of proÔ¨Ålin and formin - mediated nucleation , such that we can obtain both bimodal and fat - tailed length distributions ( see Fig . S6 & S10 ) . CONCLUSIONS In this article , we developed a stochastic model of actin Ô¨Ålament nucleation and assembly from a shared limiting pool of monomers and binding partners . Using this model , we delineate the conditions under which actin Ô¨Ålaments of variable lengths can be built and maintained . Although we ignore many important actin regulators relevant in vivo , our model provides valuable insights into how actin length can be dynamically controlled by tuning concentrations of F - actin nucleators , growth promoters and growth inhibitors . Our model can thus be better realized in an in vitro setup , where the concentrations of actin and its binding partners can be precisely controlled . Our computational model can be extended further by incorporating F - actin fragmentation and annealing , which have shown to aÔ¨Äect F - actin length distribution over longer timescales in vitro ( 32 ) . While the role of spontaneous F - actin fragmentation and annealing remains unclear in vivo ( 43 ) , models can shed light into how these slow processes may regulate Ô¨Ålament length distribution in the presence of growth promoters and growth inhibitors . We show that spontaneous nucleation can induce signif - icant length heterogeneity in the Ô¨Ålament population . This heterogeneity in length is an emergent property of spontaneous nucleation that cannot result from the growth of a Ô¨Åxed number of Ô¨Ålaments from specialized nucleators ( 26 , 27 ) . In addition , spontaneous nucleation results in a strong age - length correla - tion in the Ô¨Ålament population . A recent study by Rosenbloom et al ( 68 ) reports much slower formation and degradation of actin dimers than was previously reported by Sept and McCammon ( 42 ) . With slower nucleation rates , we Ô¨Ånd that the mean length of actin Ô¨Ålaments increases ( resulting from smaller Ô¨Ålament density ) , while the qualitative features of the Ô¨Ålament length distribution remained unchanged ( Fig S11 ) . Filament length heterogeneity and distribution can be controlled by tuning the interaction between F - actin and its growth promoters and inhibitors . We Ô¨Ånd that strong growth inhibition leads to increased length heterogeneity within physi - ologically relevant timescales . In this case , length - independent growth inhibition by capping proteins reduces the age - length correlation in the Ô¨Ålament population and a complete loss of correlation is seen at higher concentration of capping pro - teins . Our results agree well with in vitro studies reporting exponential length distribution and decreasing mean Ô¨Ålament length with increasing capping concentration ( 35 ) . Enhanced F - actin elongation by formin reveals a non - monotonic be - haviour in Ô¨Ålament length distribution with increasing formin concentration . The heterogeneity in length increases for small concentration of formin due to a competition between formin - bound and formin - free Ô¨Ålaments . This heterogeneity goes away at higher concentration of formins when there are enough formin to bind all the Ô¨Ålaments . Thus , a strong enhancement of growth rate does not result in any signiÔ¨Åcant change in length heterogeneity and retains the unimodality of length distribution . Motivated by recent in vitro studies reporting the inter - actions between formin and capping proteins ( 49 , 67 ) , we studied actin Ô¨Ålament growth in the presence of formin and capping proteins . We show that formin and capping protein concentrations can be tuned to regulate the heterogeneity in length in the Ô¨Ålament population . We Ô¨Ånd a bimodal length distribution in a regime where the concentration of formin and capping proteins are comparable such that their competition is enhanced . Bimodal length distribution may originate from an underlying bistability due to autocatalytic growth ( 27 ) , as observed in vitro for microtubules growing in the presence of Kip3 motors ( 69 ) . However , the bimodal length distribution we report here does not originate from any underlying bistability in the Ô¨Ålament growth dynamics . Here bimodality is an emer - gent collective eÔ¨Äect that arises from competition between actin growth promoters and growth inhibitors . This mecha - nism for maintaining subpopulations of short and long actin Ô¨Ålaments may play an important role in assembling distinct actin network organizations with variable lengths ( 70 , 71 ) . The Ô¨Ålaments observed in vivo are often much smaller than the range of Ô¨Ålament lengths reported in our simulations ( Fig . 6h ) . This is because actin density inside the cell are much higher than what we considered , and numerous other actin regulators in the cell may further reduce Ô¨Ålament lengths by enhanced nucleation ( e . g . by Arp - 2 / 3 ) or via F - actin severing ( e . g . via ADF / coÔ¨Ålin ) . We show that explicit modeling of proÔ¨Ålin in physiolog - ically relevant concentrations does not alter the qualitative results but changes the overall length of the formin - bound subpopulation of Ô¨Ålaments ( see Fig . S6 ) . By accounting for formin - mediated Ô¨Ålament nucleation , we Ô¨Ånd that the depen - dence of Ô¨Ålament length on formin concentration is altered , Banerjee and Banerjee depending on the formin nucleation eÔ¨Éciency . But the qualita - tive features of the Ô¨Ålament length distributions do not change in diÔ¨Äerent growth regimes . Interestingly , while formin re - tains length heterogeneity and capping proteins increase it , proÔ¨Ålins are able to reduce Ô¨Ålament length heterogeneity by limiting nucleation ( see Fig . S12 ) . Our model predicts a monotonic increase in actin elongation rate with increasing proÔ¨Ålin concentration ( Fig . S12 ) , which is in good agreement with experimental data for proÔ¨Ålin concentrations lower than that of actin ( 72 ) . At even higher proÔ¨Ålin concentrations , actin elongation rate is found to decrease with proÔ¨Ålin concentra - tion ( 72 ) , which is not captured by our current model since we do not consider the interaction between free proÔ¨Ålins and formin . To the best of our knowledge , bimodality in actin length distribution has not yet been experimentally observed in the presence of formin and capping . The recent studies on capping - formin interaction ( 49 , 67 ) are done in Ô¨Çow channels where the monomer pool may not be conserved and data on Ô¨Ålament length distribution is not reported . Interestingly , Zigmond et al ( 66 ) found unimodal length distribution in the presence of 0 . 5 ùúá M actin , 10 nM capping and 200 nM formin , which is in good agreement with our prediction that the length distribution is unimodal when formin concentration is much larger than that of capping proteins ( Fig . 6b ) . Two kinetically distinct ( diÔ¨Äerent turnover rates ) actin Ô¨Ålament subpopulations regulated by arp - 2 / 3 and formin were reported in cortical actin network ( 73 , 74 ) , but the average lengths of these subpopulations was found to be independent of the concentration of the regulators in the simulations ( 73 ) . The formin - nucleated Ô¨Ålaments were reported to be longer and was found to play an essential role in determining mechanical properties of the cortical network in comparison with the shorter Ô¨Ålaments ( 73 ) . This highlights the signiÔ¨Åcant role that Ô¨Ålament length heterogeneity may play in regulating the mechanical properties of actin networks , opening doors to future studies on this topic .
