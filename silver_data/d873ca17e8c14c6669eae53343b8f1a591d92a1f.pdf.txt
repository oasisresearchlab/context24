Matthews , University of Oregon , Eugene , OR , April 7 , 1997 ( received for review February 4 , 1997 ) ABSTRACT We used a force - measuring laser tweezers apparatus to determine the elastic properties of (cid:108) - bacterio - phage DNA as a function of ionic strength and in the presence of multivalent cations . The electrostatic contribution to the persistence length P varied as the inverse of the ionic strength in monovalent salt , as predicted by the standard worm - like polyelectrolyte model . However , ionic strength is not always the dominant variable in determining the elastic properties of DNA . Monovalent and multivalent ions have quite different effects even when present at the same ionic strength . Multi - valent ions lead to P values as low as 250 – 300 Å , well below the high - salt ‘‘fully neutralized’’ value of 450 – 500 Å characteristic of DNA in monovalent salt . The ions Mg 2 (cid:49) and Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) , in which the charge is centrally concentrated , yield lower P values than the polyamines putrescine 2 (cid:49) and spermidine 3 (cid:49) , in which the charge is linearly distributed . The elastic stretch modulus , S , and P display opposite trends with ionic strength , in contradiction to predictions of macroscopic elasticity the - ory . DNA is well described as a worm - like chain at concen - trations of trivalent cations capable of inducing condensation , if condensation is prevented by keeping the molecule stretched . A retractile force appears in the presence of mul - tivalent cations at molecular extensions that allow intramo - lecular contacts , suggesting condensation in stretched DNA occurs by a ‘‘thermal ratchet’’ mechanism . Ions strongly affect such biologically significant behavior of DNA as wrapping around nucleosomes , packaging inside bacteriophage capsids , and binding to proteins involved in transcriptional initiation and elongation . While such influence is often explained by relatively simple ion exchange equilibria ( 1 , 2 ) , in many cases ions appear to exert their effect by modifying the structure and mechanical properties of DNA— its bending and torsional rigidity . The study of the ionic dependence of the elastic properties of DNA is therefore essential to understand the energetics of these key biological processes . Recent technical advances in nanomanipulation have al - lowed the mechanical behavior of single DNA molecules to be studied . Magnetic beads ( 3 , 4 ) , micro fibers ( 5 ) , optical traps ( 6 ) , and hydrodynamic flow ( 7 ) have been used to apply a wide range of forces to individual bacteriophage DNA molecules . Smith et al . ( 6 ) have recently described three regimes in the elastic response of (cid:108) - bacteriophage DNA ( (cid:108) DNA ) molecules . Between 0 . 01 and 10 pN , the molecule behaves as an entropic spring and is well described by the worm - like chain ( WLC ) model ( 8 – 10 ) , from which a persistence length , P , and a contour length , L o , can be obtained . Between 10 and 65 pN , the molecule deviates from the predictions of the inextensible WLC as it extends beyond its B - form contour length . From this ‘‘enthalpic elasticity’’ regime an elastic stretch modulus , S , can be obtained . Finally , at about 65 pN , the molecule suddenly yields in a highly cooperative fashion and overstretches (cid:39) 1 . 7 times . A more recent study using an optical trapping intero - ferometer ( 11 ) has probed the entropic and enthalpic elasticity of single plasmid - length DNA molecules . In this paper we used a force - measuring optical trap instru - ment ( 6 ) to determine the elastic properties of (cid:108) DNA as a function of ionic strength and in the presence of multivalent cations . Our results show the following effects , some of them unexpected , of ion concentration , valence , and structure on DNA elasticity : ( i ) The electrostatic contribution to P varies as the inverse of the ionic strength , I , in monovalent salt , as predicted by the standard uniformly charged cylinder model ( 12 , 13 ) . However , ionic strength is not always the dominant variable in determining the elastic properties of DNA ; mono - valent and multivalent ions have quite different effects even when present at the same ionic strength . Multivalent ions lead to persistence lengths as low as 250 – 300 Å , well below the high - salt ‘‘fully neutralized’’ value of 450 – 500 Å characteristic of DNA in monovalent salt . ( ii ) Ions in which the charge is centrally concentrated [ Mg 2 (cid:49) , Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) ] lead to lower P values than those in which the same charge is linearly distrib - uted ( putrescine 2 (cid:49) , spermidine 3 (cid:49) ) . ( iii ) The elastic stretch modulus and persistence length display opposite trends with ionic strength—a direct contradiction of macroscopic elasticity theory . ( iv ) DNA is still well described by the WLC model at concentrations of trivalent cations capable of inducing DNA collapse or condensation , if collapse is prevented by keeping the molecule stretched . ( v ) No evidence of the buckling transition that has been postulated to underlie condensation ( 14 ) is observed . Instead , a retractile force appears in the presence of multivalent cations at molecular extensions that allow intramolecular contacts , suggesting the existence of a ‘‘thermal ratchet’’ condensation mechanism in stretched DNA . WLC Elastic Behavior The WLC model describes the behavior of a DNA molecule as intermediate between a rigid rod and a flexible coil , account - ing for both local stiffness and long - range flexibility ( 15 ) . The flexibility of the chain is described by the persistence length P , the distance over which two segments of the chain remain directionally correlated . An interpolation formula that de - scribes the extension x of a WLC with contour length L o in response to a stretching force F is ( 8 , 9 ) FP kT (cid:53) 1 4 (cid:83) 1 (cid:50) x L o (cid:68) (cid:50) 2 (cid:50) 1 4 (cid:49) x L o , [ 1 ] where k (cid:53) the Boltzmann constant and T (cid:53) absolute temper - ature . This equation describes the entropic elasticity of the WLC , arising from the reduced entropy of the stretched chain ( x (cid:35) 16 (cid:109) m for (cid:108) DNA ) , and assumes that the DNA is inextensible .

In this regime DNA can also be enthalpically stretched beyond the contour length defined by B - DNA geometry ( 6 ) . An equation that describes this extensible WLC regime ( 14 (cid:35) x (cid:35) 17 (cid:109) m for (cid:108) DNA ) is ( 10 ) x L o (cid:53) 1 (cid:50) 1 2 (cid:83) kT FP (cid:68) 1 / 2 (cid:49) F S , [ 2 ] where S is the elastic stretch modulus . The first two terms on the right hand side of Eq . 2 describe the extension of the molecule as x 3 L o and correspond to the strong - stretching limit of Eq . 1 . The third term describes the extension of the molecule beyond its canonical B - DNA length ; i . e . , it is the enthalpic component of the elasticity . The range of applica - bility for Eq . 1 may be extended by including this enthalpic component ( 11 ) ; however , nearly identical values of P , L o , and S are obtained . At extensions beyond these two elastic regimes , DNA un - dergoes a reversible overstretch transition to a form (cid:39) 70 % longer than canonical B - DNA ( 5 , 6 ) . Behavior and Analysis of Force – Extension Curves (cid:108) DNA molecules were tethered between two streptavidin - coated latex beads ( diameter (cid:53) 3 . 54 (cid:109) m ) . One bead was held by a micropipette while the other was optically trapped by force - measuring laser tweezers ( Fig . 1 ) . The extension of the DNA molecule was determined from the distance between beads . The force acting on the molecule was inferred from the displacement of the laser beams on position - sensitive photo - detectors , and it was calibrated against the viscous drag on a bead by using Stokes law ( ref . 6 ; C . B . , D . Keller , and S . B . S . , unpublished work ) . The 5 (cid:57) - overhangs of (cid:108) DNA ( methylated c 1857 ind 1 Sam 7 ; New England Biolabs ) were biotinylated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase using biotin - 11 - dCTP ( Sigma ) , dATP , dGTP , and dUTP as described previously ( 6 ) . Single - strand nicks were repaired with DNA ligase . After biotinyla - tion and nick ligation , DNA stocks were stored in an EDTA - containing buffer . Monovalent salt solutions were prepared by diluting 100 mM cacodylate pH 7 buffer stocks ( 86 . 2 mM sodium cacodylate , 13 . 8 mM cacodylic acid ) supplemented with either 100 or 500 mM NaCl ( total Na (cid:49) concentration ca . 186 and 586 mM , respectively ) . MgCl 2 (cid:122) 2H 2 O ( Baker ) , putrescine (cid:122) 2HCl ( Sigma ) , spermidine (cid:122) 3HCl ( Sigma ) , and hexaammine cobalt ( III ) trichloride ( Eastman ) , hereafter re - ferred to as Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) , were utilized without further purifi - cation and prepared as 0 . 1 M stocks in deionized water ( (cid:114) (cid:36) 12 M (cid:86) (cid:122) cm ) . Final concentrations of the di - and trivalent cations were prepared in background buffer ( BB ) : 1 mM NaCl (cid:121) 1 mM cacodylate , pH 7 ( total Na (cid:49) concentration (cid:39) 1 . 86 mM ) . Complete buffer exchange between experiments was ensured by monitoring the conductivity of the fluid chamber eluant . Experimental buffers containing Mg 2 (cid:49) were purged from the chamber by extensive washing with an EDTA - containing buffer . Dependence of F – x Curves on Monovalent Salt Concentra - tion . Force vs . extension curves for single (cid:108) DNA molecules at NaCl concentrations of 1 , 50 , and 500 mM are plotted in Fig . 2 A . The entropic and enthalpic stretching regimes are enlarged in Fig . 3 A , distinctly showing that P decreases and S increases as the salt concentration is raised . A lower value of P causes the force curve to rise more abruptly at low extensions , since the more flexible chain exists in a less extended conformation than the stiffer chain with higher P . Increases in S are readily apparent as increased slopes of the F – x curves at extensions approaching the contour length . As observed previously ( 6 ) , decreasing monovalent ionic strength lowers the force at which (cid:108) DNA cooperatively overstretches to a conformation (cid:39) 1 . 7 times longer than B - DNA . Individual molecules often display hysteresis ( Fig . 2 A , arrows ) upon relaxation of this form . The persistence lengths , contour lengths , and elastic stretch moduli were extracted by fitting the entropic and enthalpic stretching data with the appropriate WLC models : inextensible WLC ( Eq . 1 ) , strong - stretching limit ( Eq . 2 without F (cid:121) S term ) , and extensible WLC ( complete Eq . 2 ) . P and S values are shown in Table 1 . L o was 16 . 5 (cid:54) 0 . 2 (cid:109) m , and it showed no trend with F IG . 1 . Schematic diagram showing the geometry of the experi - ment . Two counter propagating laser beams ‘‘trap’’ a bead in the middle of a specially designed fluid chamber , far ( (cid:46) 100 (cid:109) m ) from the chamber walls . The other bead is held by a micropipette introduced inside the chamber . The micropipette is moved to increase or decrease the tension in the DNA molecule that bridges the two beads .

This corresponds to 3 . 40 (cid:54) 0 . 04 Å (cid:121) base pair ( bp ) , within the range determined from crystallography for B - DNA ( 3 . 32 (cid:54) 0 . 19 Å ) ( 18 , 19 ) . At the strong - stretching limit where P dominates the elasticity ( x (cid:39) 14 – 16 (cid:109) m ) , (cid:108) DNA follows the WLC behavior predicted by Eq . 2 without the enthalpic stretching term F (cid:121) S . A plot of data for 500 mM NaCl and the predicted WLC behavior ( solid line ) are shown in Fig . 4 A . Dependence of F – x Curves on Multivalent Cations . The elastic response of (cid:108) DNA molecules in BB with Mg 2 (cid:49) , putrescine , spermidine , and Co ( NH 3 ) 6 3 (cid:49) is shown in Fig . 2 B . P , L o , and S were derived from the entropic and enthalpic elastic behavior of (cid:108) DNA ( Fig . 3 B ) as explained above . P and S are given in Table 2 . L o values did not differ significantly from those observed in monovalent salt , showing that multivalent cations do not provoke observable secondary structure tran - sitions in (cid:108) DNA under the conditions employed here . The di - and trivalent cations strongly reduce P and increase S of (cid:108) DNA . As shown in Fig . 4 B – E , strong - stretching WLC behavior is still followed ( solid lines ) despite the large reductions in P . F IG . 3 .

Biophysics : Baumann et al . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 94 ( 1997 ) 6187 Multivalent cations also increase the force at which the mol - ecule overstretches , yielding values characteristic of high monovalent salt ( Fig . 2 B ) . The nonzero force ( 1 – 5 pN ) observed with 25 (cid:109) M Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) and 100 (cid:109) M spermidine at x (cid:44) 14 (cid:109) m ( Fig . 3 B ) is likely to be due to side - by - side association of the DNA which , if unconstrained , would lead to intramolecular collapse . This phenomenon was frequently observed with concentrations of spermidine and Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) sufficient to condense DNA ( 20 , 21 ) ; it was reversible , and could be avoided by keeping the molecule stretched . A nonzero force baseline was added to Eqs . 1 and 2 when fitting these F – x curves . The advantages of single - molecule manipulations are obvious here , as we are able to determine the elastic properties of DNA at concentrations of spermidine and Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) that would cause condensation in bulk . Persistence Length Monovalent Salt Dependence of P . P values tabulated in Table 1 as a function of monovalent ionic strength are plotted in Fig . 5 . The three WLC fits ( data points in Fig . 5 ) yield very similar values of P ( normally within 10 % ) . Models which incorporate chain extensibility yield essentially the same P as those that do not , probably because the entropic and enthalpic components dominate the elastic behavior of the molecule in different parts of the F – x curve . The nonelectrostatic contri - bution dominates P at I (cid:46) 20 mM , in accord with previous experimental determinations using light scattering ( 22 ) and flow birefringence ( 23 ) with phage DNA , and electro - optical measurements ( 24 ) with short ( 41 – 256 bp ) DNA fragments . Throughout the range of I investigated here , the data are well fit with a nonlinear Poisson – Boltzmann theory for uni - formly charged cylinders ( 12 , 13 ) P (cid:53) P o (cid:49) P el (cid:53) P o (cid:49) 1 4 (cid:107) 2 l B (cid:53) P o (cid:49) 0 . 324 I (cid:50) 1 Å , [ 3 ] where P o and P el are the nonelectrostatic and electrostatic contributions to P , 1 (cid:121) (cid:107) is the Debye – Hu¨ckel screening length , and l B is the Bjerrum length ( 7 . 14 Å in water at 25°C for double - stranded DNA ) . The last equality gives P in Å with I in molar units . The curve in Fig . 5 is drawn with P o (cid:53) 500 Å ; values between 450 and 500 Å fit equally well , in agreement with most previous determinations ( 25 ) . Values of P with Multivalent Cations . The values of P with Mg 2 (cid:49) , putrescine 2 (cid:49) , spermidine 3 (cid:49) , or Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) are strik - ingly lower than those at essentially the same ionic strength but with Na (cid:49) as the only cation . Twenty - five micromolar spermi - dine and 5 (cid:109) M Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) are the critical concentrations required to condense DNA under these buffer conditions ( 20 , 21 ) . At these concentrations , P was reduced 2 - to 4 - fold relative to low monovalent salt buffer . Higher concentrations did not produce significant further reductions . The effects of Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) on the entropic elasticity are dramatic ( Fig . 6 ) : as little as 2 (cid:109) M Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) reduced P to roughly the same extent as 100 (cid:109) M spermidine 3 (cid:49) , and the plateau value of P at higher Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) concentrations is near 250 Å , half the limiting value for monovalent salt . This fact may have some bearing on the efficiency with which Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) condenses DNA ( 21 ) ( see below ) . Mg 2 (cid:49) and putrescine 2 (cid:49) cannot condense DNA in aqueous solution , yet also reduce P by 2 - to 3 - fold at low ionic strength . We note that Co ( NH 3 ) 6 3 (cid:49) reduces P more strongly F IG . 5 . Dependence of persistence length ( P ) on monovalent ( Na (cid:49) ) ionic strength .

This is probably due to the central concentration of charge in Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) and Mg 2 (cid:49) compared with the linear distribution of charges in the polyamines . These effects of Mg 2 (cid:49) , spermidine 3 (cid:49) , and Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) on the entropic elasticity of DNA agree well with those found pre - viously . Electro - optical studies of short DNA fragments showed that 100 (cid:109) M Mg 2 (cid:49) and 10 (cid:109) M Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) reduced P to (cid:39) 350 Å and 200 Å , respectively , in low monovalent salt ( 26 ) . Linear dichroism and viscometry studies of T7 DNA showed that a precondensation spermidine concentration of 20 (cid:109) M decreased P to (cid:39) 445 Å ( 27 ) . Our result for 100 (cid:109) M spermidine , (cid:39) 430 Å , shows this to be a limiting value , very near the accepted value of P o . Despite the large alteration of the entropic elasticity by multivalent cations , (cid:108) DNA still follows the linear behavior predicted by the strong - stretching limit of the WLC model ( Fig . 4 B – E ) . Changes in the persistence length of a WLC could be due to changes in permanent static bending , thermally induced dynamic bending , or both ( 28 ) . Although , strictly speaking , our data cannot differentiate between ion - induced changes in static vs . dynamic bending , large permanent bends would probably cause deviations from the behavior predicted by the strong - stretching limit ( Eq . 2 ) , and this is not observed ( C . B . , D . Keller , and S . B . S . , unpublished work ) . Furthermore , site - binding is usually invoked to explain the formation of static bends , yet NMR studies of di - and multivalent cation mobility show most ions are loosely associated with random DNA sequences rather than tightly bound ( 29 – 31 ) . We suggest that decreases in P arise mainly from enhanced bending fluctuations skewed toward the concentrated positive charge at sites of transiently associated di - or multivalent counterions . Theory ( I . Rouzina and V . A . B . , unpublished work ) predicts a few transiently associated cations per persistence length , each inducing a bend of (cid:39) 20° distributed over 6 bp , would be sufficient to cause the observed decrease in P . Thermal fluctuations result in an (cid:39) 4° bend per bp , thus the postulated transient bending is similar in magnitude to thermal bending and should not perturb the B - form helix . The reduced P caused by multivalent cations will decrease the volume occupied by the DNA coil , enhancing the close packing of DNA and increasing the probability of intrachain contacts through a reduction in search space . However , an increase in DNA flexibility alone will not drive the collapse of DNA , since divalent cations do not produce this effect . Rather , the driving force for DNA collapse must also reside in the ability of a cation to reduce most , but not all , of the DNA phosphate charge while influencing helix hydration ( 32 ) , helix secondary structure ( 33 ) , and (cid:121) or electrostatic attractions through ion correlation ( 34 , 35 ) . Stretch Elasticity Dependence of S on Monovalent Salt . The elastic stretch modulus of single (cid:108) DNA molecules in monovalent salt buffer was determined by fitting F – x data to the extensible WLC model , Eq . 2 , yielding the S values shown in Table 1 . The scatter for individual S values is high ( mean SD (cid:39) 28 % ) , but S clearly decreases as the ionic strength is lowered , a trend opposite to that of P . This presents a surprising contradiction to the predictions of macroscopic elasticity theory for a homogeneous elastic rod . According to that theory ( 36 ) , if a uniform rod of cross - sectional area A has a stretch modulus of S , then the Young’s modulus E of the material constituting that rod is given by E (cid:53) S (cid:121) A . [ 4 ] The bending rigidity of the rod , B , varies with the Young’s modulus and the cross - sectional area moment of inertia M as B (cid:53) EM . [ 5 ] The persistence length of a WLC is given by P (cid:53) B (cid:121) kT ( 37 ) so that P (cid:53) EM (cid:121) kT . [ 6 ] For a cylindrical molecule , A (cid:53) (cid:112) r 2 and M (cid:53) (cid:112) r 4 (cid:121) 4 and therefore P (cid:53) Sr 2 (cid:121) 4 kT . [ 7 ] Eq . 7 indicates that P and S should vary in the same way with I if r remains approximately constant , while Table 1 shows that they change in opposite directions . Taking a high - salt value for S of 1400 pN from Table 1 and using r (cid:53) 10 Å gives E (cid:53) 4 . 5 (cid:51) 10 8 Pa from Eq . 4 and P (cid:53) 845 Å from Eq . 6 , clearly too large for the high - salt case . A typical low - salt value for S of 500 pN would give P (cid:53) 400 Å by Eq . 7 , whereas the geometric persistence length in low salt has increased by electrostatic effects to beyond 800 Å . Relaxing the assumption that the molecular radius remains constant cannot account for these variations . To make Eq . 7 consistent with the measured S and P values from Table 1 requires that the radius increase from 8 Å at high salt to 16 Å at low salt , a prediction totally at variance with experiment . Fluorescence polarization anisotropy measurements of inter - calated ethidium showed that the radius of 48 - bp DNA frag - ments increased by only 0 . 3 Å between 100 and 20 mM Na (cid:49) ( 38 ) . The decrease in S with decreasing I implies that , as the ionic strength is lowered , DNA becomes more susceptible to en - thalpic elongation . This effect is more complex than a simple increase in electrostatic repulsion among the DNA phos - phates . A charged Hookean spring would adopt a longer equilibrium contour length if the ionic strength were reduced , and its spring constant ( S value ) would also increase . A possible explanation for the decrease of S with I is that at low I there is localized melting in A (cid:49) T - rich regions . Increases in I would reduce both local melting and intramolecular electro - static repulsion , thus simultaneously increasing S and decreas - ing P . Thus it appears that ionic strength effects on S and P reflect different molecular mechanisms , and therefore are not governed by macroscopic elasticity theory . This is not the first indication that DNA does not behave like a classical macroscopic cylinder . Other evidence comes from a comparison of the bending rigidity and the constant of torsional rigidity C ( 39 ) . These are related as B (cid:121) C (cid:53) 1 (cid:49) (cid:115) , [ 8 ] where (cid:115) is the Poisson ratio – i . e . , the negative of the ratio of radial compression to axial elongation ( 36 ) . For an incom - pressible rod , (cid:115) (cid:53) 1 ⁄ 2 , and thermodynamic stability requires (cid:50) 1 (cid:44) (cid:115) (cid:44) 1 ⁄ 2 . Values of (cid:115) (cid:44) 0 correspond to a thickening of the rod as it is stretched , a behavior unknown in homogeneous , isotropic elastic material . From Eq . 5 , B (cid:53) 2 (cid:51) 10 (cid:50) 19 erg (cid:122) cm at 25°C if P (cid:53) 500 Å . Values of C vary considerably from one investigation to the next , but are generally in the range 2 (cid:51) 10 (cid:50) 19 to 3 . 4 (cid:51) 10 (cid:50) 19 erg (cid:122) cm ( for reviews see refs . 25 and 40 ) . These values give (cid:115) from 0 to (cid:50) 0 . 4 . Of course , there is no reason to assume that double - stranded DNA , with its external phosphates , internal stacked base pairs , and major and minor grooves , should behave like an isotropic , homogeneous , cylindrical rod . Indeed , its volume and mass are not strictly fixed , since the presence of a spine of hydration may depend on mechanical stress , temperature , or type of salt . But the simple rod assumption is commonly made in modeling DNA behavior , and the results we discuss here are a dramatic illustration of the limitations of this point of view . Biophysics : Baumann et al . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 94 ( 1997 ) 6189 S with Multivalent Cations . Fits to the extensible WLC model show that di - and trivalent cations stabilize the DNA duplex against enthalpic elongation ( Table 2 ) . Condensing concentrations of spermidine 3 (cid:49) ( (cid:36) 25 (cid:109) M ) and Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) ( (cid:36) 5 (cid:109) M ) stabilize (cid:108) DNA against elongation as if it were in 50 mM NaCl . Mg 2 (cid:49) and putrescine 2 (cid:49) also increase S to similar levels . These observations parallel results with di - and trivalent cations in DNA melting temperature experiments ( 41 – 44 ) , and they support localized melting as a possible explanation for decreases in S as discussed above . Mg 2 (cid:49) and the naturally occurring polyamines may act in vivo to oppose forces which destabilize or melt duplex DNA during supercoiling , replica - tion , and transcription . Concluding Remarks Single - molecule methods offer several advantages over bulk studies : ( i ) The three elastic regimes can be investigated separately , making it possible to distinguish their possibly different molecular origins . ( ii ) Molecules of different lengths can be studied in a variety of solution conditions at molecular extensions where excluded volume effects , which often com - plicate the interpretation of bulk experiments ( ref . 22 and references therein ) , may be neglected . ( iii ) DNA is condensed into compact particles by multivalent cations . In single - molecule experiments the extension of the molecule can be controlled so as to prevent its condensation , making it possible to separate the effects of condensation from changes in the elasticity of DNA induced by these cations . ( iv ) Manipulations of DNA at molecular extensions that preclude intramolecular contacts can be used , as reported here , to test the competing hypotheses that cation - induced condensation is due to attrac - tive intersegmental free energy arising from electrostatics , hydration , and helix perturbation ( 17 ) , or from abrupt buckling transitions ( 14 ) . ( v ) Condensation of single molecules probably involves loop formation to yield a stable toroidal nucleus . Since this mechanism requires slack in the molecule , it can be prevented by applying external tension . The retractile force seen in Fig . 3 B may have been generated when thermal motion created temporary slack , thus enabling loops to form and side - by - side association to occur . Such association acted like a pawl in a ratchet to take up any slack and prevent the reversal of thermal motion . Since the permanent tension generated in the molecule could not have occurred without thermal motion , the constrained condensation behaves as a ‘‘thermal ratchet . ’’ We thank Dr .
