COVID - 19 ' s apparent deceptiveness may be to blame for the uproar : Transmission and death are around average when compared to previous fatal virus epidemics . This led to a major underestimation of the severity of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus at the start of the COVID - 19 epidemic . As a result , this research study refers to viruses that share characteristics with SARS - CoV - 2 as Panic Zone viruses in this study . To stop the spread of these viruses , early identification , proper isolation , and treatment of affected individuals are critical in containing outbreaks . As the current COVID - 19 epidemic demonstrates , this is particularly important when it comes to diseases that are spread via contact or exposure . Keywords : COVID - 19 , Temperature , oxygen , sensor , Arduino , Viruses . I . INTRODUCTION The newest respiratory sickness outbreak , known as Coronavirus Illness 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , was identified in Wuhan , China , in December of this year . The disease causing it , SARS - CoV - 2 , has been demonstrated to be chemically identical to the viruses that cause the respiratory distress syndrome ( SARS ) ( SARS ) . If you ' re accused of having COVID - 19 , you possess pneumonia that satisfies the following four criteria : ( 1 ) fever , with or without a documented temperature ; ( 2 ) radiological evidence of bronchitis ; ( 3 ) low or average white - cell counts ; and ( 4 ) no recovery in signs after three days of antibiotic therapy [ 1 , 2 ] . There have been unprecedented crises of lethal viruses including Zika , Ebola , SARS , and MERS since the turn of the twenty - first century . Either the development of already existing viruses or the advent of new viral species triggered the outbreaks of these viral illnesses . Society has already suffered much as a result of illnesses like polio and AIDS . The death toll was high , but the aftereffects were just as tragic : survivors ' mental health was affected , and the economy suffered as a result . Earlier this year , another virus , SARS - CoV - 2 , made headlines across the globe ( the disease associated with this virus is called COVID - 19 ) . By enhancing self - isolation and early treatment , infectious illness early detection may help reduce the transmission of disease . Diagnostic techniques nowadays mostly use nasal fluid , saliva , or blood samples with nucleic acid assays for current infections and blood - based serological testing with previous infection detection for past infection . Despite their great sensitivity , nucleic acid - based diagnostics may need collecting samples up to a week after exposure before a definitive yes is found1 . In addition , they are difficult to execute on a regular basis and are hampered by a growing scarcity of critical reagents . It is possible to identify significant changes from baseline physiology at the beginning of infection using consumer wearable sensors , which are accurate and widely deployed . Early diagnosis of Lyme disease can be done using smart watches and inexpensive pulse oximeters . Even if there are no symptoms , it may be possible to diagnose viral respiratory infections based on the patient ' s heart rate and skin temperature , according to research that looked back at previous cases . The use of wearable sensors allowed for the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation . Recently - conducted epidemiological studies have shown the utility of using increased heart rate data from smart watches in viral outbreak investigations . The use of wearable technology has a great deal of potential for preventing the pandemic that will be caused by the coronavirus in 2019 . ( COVID - 19 ) . Even though there is still a significant need for improved infection monitoring as a result of the effect of the pandemic , population - scale technology solutions provide the possibility of a technique to identify occurrences in real time for the purpose of virus tracking and identification [ 3 ] . PCR techniques are now used to Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Electronics , Communication and Aerospace Technology ( ICECA 2022 ) IEEE Xplore Part Number : CFP22J88 - ART ; ISBN : 978 - 1 - 6654 - 8271 - 4 978 - 1 - 6654 - 8271 - 4 / 22 / $ 31 . 00 ©2022 IEEE 158 2022 6 t h I n t e r n a t i o n a l C o n f e r e n c e o n E l e c t r o n i c s , C o m m un i c a t i o n a nd A e r o s p a c e T e c hn o l o g y ( I C E C A ) | 978 - 1 - 6654 - 8271 - 4 / 22 / $ 31 . 00 © 2 0 22 I EEE | D O I : 10 . 1109 / I C E C A 55336 . 2022 . 10009600 identify active infections ; however , it may take up to three days following infection for reliable positive results to develop 1 . Furthermore , PCR testing aren ' t routinely performed . Furthermore , since most infections are only discovered after symptoms appear , existing testing techniques are unlikely to detect pre - symptomatic carriers , making it difficult to adopt early - stage treatments that decrease transmission [ 4 , 5 ] . About half of those with COVID - 19 remain asymptomatic , which allows the virus to spread even more quickly . As a consequence of this , there is an immediate need for methods that are easily accessible and don ' t cost an arm and a leg for the genuine early identification of COVID - 19 . This is the concept of a Covid - 19 suspicion detection device that , by identifying the symptoms of Covid - 19 , might aid individuals in isolating themselves and maintaining social distance from others . This piece of equipment mostly picks up on indicators of breathlessness and an increased core body temperature while monitoring a patient ' s condition . In most instances , shortness of breath produces low blood oxygen levels due to infection in the lungs caused by the corona virus , which results in hypoxia ( low blood oxygen levels ) . So , today , we ' re going to examine our device for signs of the virus to see if there are any suspicions that need to be checked out further for confirmation [ 6 ] . Two signs have been suggested in this study : an elevated body temperature and a high blood oxygen percentage . II . RELATED WORK Wearable computers are defined as any body - worn device that is designed to give value added services while a user is conducting other activities . Based on the awareness level , this definition encompasses all body - worn computers . In addition to smartwatches , other examples of wearable computers that are now on the market include fitness and activity trackers , as well as health monitors . Personal tastes determine how individuals use their smartwatches . Participants claimed to use their smartwatches for a variety of purposes , including receiving alerts , augmenting their conventional timepieces , keeping tabs on their health , and even as an entertainment device . There are many physiological changes that may be tracked using wearable sensors while suffering from COVID - 19 or another viral infection [ 7 , 8 ] . From 2014 to 2016 , consumer smart watches quickly infiltrated the field of health research . Studies on patients utilised activity , behaviour , heart rate , and seizure monitoring to help better understand their condition . Most research was aimed at validating the functionality of smart watches . Battery power and data quality constraints are major technological difficulties . Larger research including data from smart watches and other health data are required . A " general - purpose , connected device with a number of sensors " that can be worn on the wrist is what is known as a " smart watch . " A smart watch is not simply a wristwatch ; it is also a " general - purpose , webserver . " Smartwatch , which are recognisable to the vast majority of people and are becoming more ubiquitous as a consumer item [ 10 , 11 ] , have the potential to revolutionise the health care industry . They facilitate personalised messages and reminders , allowing in - situ surveys to be carried out , and enable near - real - time constant monitoring of physiological measurements and physical activity . Additionally , smart watches have the ability to enhance patient care by assisting with and analysing an individual ' s health in their daily lives . These devices have the potential to make a meaningful contribution to the treatment of epilepsy as well as cardiology research and practise . The fundamental principle of biomedical informatics , which states that , a partnership partnering with an online resource is ' better ' than that very same partner unassisted , is applicable to the usage of smart watches as a health information device . Smart watches have gained popularity among casual wearers , but before they can be used to make health care choices , these gadgets must be thoroughly tested [ 12 ] . Smart watches , on the other hand , are a newer kind of technology , and study into their potential health benefits is just beginning . As a result , the purpose of this research is to call attention to methodological issues that are associated with the use of smart watches as a daily support system for health and wellness and to define the applications of smart watch devices in health - related research . Smart watches can do a wide range of tasks , including receiving and making phone calls , sending and receiving messages and emails , and scheduling events on the calendar . It also measures things like how far you walk or run , how fast your heart is beating , and so on [ 13 ] . It often includes a CPU , wireless chip for wi - fi , Bluetooth , and cellular connectivity , as well as a GPS chip . Smart watches may be used in conjunction with smartphones , making it possible to switch between the two . It aids in the process of making and receiving phone calls . For limitless internet and voice calls , the post - paid number and plan may be shared with a smart watch . Wireless chip means it can connect to cellular network and GPS network simultaneously [ 9 ] . There are three types of connectivity provided by this device : Bluetooth , Wi - Fi , and cellular . It ' s a lightweight watch with a small profile . There are hundreds of applications included , including several for staying healthy . It ' s made up of a number of sensors that detect things like heart rate and blood pressure as well as how many calories you ' ve burnt and how far you ' ve travelled . There are many ways to wear it , including phone mode , bracelet mode , and timepiece mode . To meet your own style Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Electronics , Communication and Aerospace Technology ( ICECA 2022 ) IEEE Xplore Part Number : CFP22J88 - ART ; ISBN : 978 - 1 - 6654 - 8271 - 4 978 - 1 - 6654 - 8271 - 4 / 22 / $ 31 . 00 ©2022 IEEE 159 preferences , smart watches come in a range of hues . Nevertheless , your smart watch ' s memory capacity determines how much data you can store on it . As a result , make sure it meets your requirements before purchasing ; otherwise , storing data will be a hassle . Smart watches may go into the thousands of dollars [ 14 , 15 ] . Water resistance varies across the timepieces . The phone ' s touch screen is much larger . The low battery life is a problem . A smart watch can ' t do anything without a smartphone . Because smartwatches have considerably lower accuracy than oximeters , PulseOximeters ' oxygen saturation readings may be more accurate . Smartwatches are still unable to accurately detect core body temperature . They can now monitor the skin ' s temperature , but their results are subject to a variety of outside influences . Wearable temperature sensors , on the other hand , are anticipated to provide a more precise reading of body temperature . Almost certainly ! They ' re not as precise as expensive , high - tech medical equipment , but they ' re not too far off [ 16 ] . The smartwatch or fitness band is acceptable as long as you are not using it for crucial monitoring . Because of their size and cost to operate , most medical devices don ' t come with social media - enabled applications for our cell phones and tablets [ 17 ] . Before we have professional technology in our hands , we still have a long way to go ( or wrists ) . Smartwatches and fitness trackers often include sensors that can capture irregular heart rates , but only when they are at their highest point [ 18 , 19 ] . However , for the most part , they are accurate , and this is preferable than having no heart rate monitoring at all . III . SCOPE OF RESEARCH Infection with Covid - 19 is on the rise , and so is mortality as a result . As a result , we must take responsibility for our own well - being . To begin , we must be conscious of our body temperature and oxygen levels ( which are regarded the most important criteria for identifying the suspect in the second Covid - 19 wave ) as a first precaution . This is consciousness if you ask me . Using the temperature and oxygen levels in our bodies to determine whether or not we are coronas , the covid - 19 detecting gadget will be able to assist us determine whether we are . IV . PROPOSED SYSTEM Symptoms such as elevated body temperature and a low oxygen saturation percentage are common in people with Covid 19 . Shortness of breath and an elevated core body temperature are the primary signs picked up by this equipment . In most instances , shortness of breath produces low blood oxygen levels due to infection in the lungs caused by the corona virus , which results in hypoxia ( low blood oxygen levels ) . It begins by testing temperature using an mpu6050 sensor and oxygen saturation with a max30100 sensor . The person ' s body temperature is considered to be symptom S1 , and their oxygen consumption is assumed to be symptom S2 . Consequently , if the body temperature is high , the symptom s1 is positive , and a normal oxygen saturation level indicates the presence of symptom s2 being negative , indicating that the patient has a normal fever . As a result , if the person ' s body temperature is normal and they find that their oxygen levels are low , they will have shortness of breath , and this will be a sign that they have symptom s1 . After that , if the individual has a high body temperature and low oxygen levels are recorded , the gadget indicates that the person may be a covid afflicted person ( symptoms s1 and s2 ) . This is the idea of a Covid - 19 suspect detection gadget that may assist people isolate themselves and conduct social distance by detecting the symptoms of Covid - 19 . Given that it ' s a suspect - detection gadget , anybody who ' s suspected may be checked out further to confirm it and be treated as a result of it . Fig . 1 . Flow chart of proposed system V .

It has everything you need to get started with the microcontroller , including a micro USB connector , so all you have to do is plug it in . It is designed in such a way that it may simply be mounted on a breadboard . The ATmega32U4 on the Micro board is identical to that on the Arduino Leonardo in that it comes pre - programmed for USB connection . MAX30100 : The MAX30100 is a sensor system that combines pulse oximetry with a heart - rate monitor . It utilises low - noise analogue signal processing , two LEDs , a photodetector , and specialised optics to detect pulse oximetry and heart rate data . MPU6050 : As part of the MPU6050 , you ' ll also get an integrated temperature sensor , which measures temperatures accurately to 1°C in the - 40 to 85°C range . The silicon die temperature is being measured , not the surrounding air temperature . SSD1306 OLED : The SSD1306 is a CMOS OLED driver and controller that may be found in OLED dot - matrix graphic display systems . The brightness of an OLED panel may be adjusted in increments of 256 . OLED displays come in a variety of resolutions , including 128x32 and 128x64 , as well . 128x64 pixels are shown on the OLED panel seen above . An OLED dot - matrix graphic display system uses the SSD1306 CMOS OLED driver and controller . The Brightness of an OLED panel may be adjusted in increments of 256 . As well as 128x32 and 128x64 , OLED displays are also available with various resolutions . The 128x64 pixel OLED panel you see above is one such example . Software Tool used Arduino IDE : Arduino ' s Integrated Development Environment ( IDE ) is built in C and C + + and runs on Windows , macOS , and Linux . Using third - party cores , it may also be used to programme other vendor development boards , such as Arduino similar ones . Proteus : Developed by Lab Center Electronics , Proteus is a computer simulation and electronics design development tool . When you first start working on a project , you want to make sure the circuit design or firmware code works correctly before you start physically changing it . Because of Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Electronics , Communication and Aerospace Technology ( ICECA 2022 ) IEEE Xplore Part Number : CFP22J88 - ART ; ISBN : 978 - 1 - 6654 - 8271 - 4 978 - 1 - 6654 - 8271 - 4 / 22 / $ 31 . 00 ©2022 IEEE 161 its large library collection , Proteus is the best choice for simulating Arduino projects . The software may be used to create PCB designs as well as simulations . You may virtually construct your circuit using the library ' s large number of components . The virtual instruments ( voltmeter & ammeter ) , analyzer , component comes , and other tools that come along with Proteus make it easy to construct and troubleshoot your inventions , regardless of how complicated they may be . VI . SIMULATIONS AND RESULTS It begins by taking a temperature reading from a sensor on the body . This causes the first sign to be marked as positive , displaying s1 + on an OLED display . Next , the heart rate and oxygen saturation are monitored using the Max30100 sensor . s2 + is Shown on the OLED display if the gadget determines that the oxygen percentage in the blood is lower than the usual oxygen level . If the individual has both signs and symptoms of the virus , he or she should be brought to a hospital for testing and treatment . For this project , I ' m measuring temperature with either an MPU6050 or an LM35 sensor . In order to figure out my blood oxygen saturation % , I ' m using a MAX30100 oxygen sensor . Essentially , it ' s On a breadboard , an Fig . 3 . Hardware implementation Arduino Pro Micro is serially linked to an MPU6050 and then to a MAX30100 and an OLED display for testing . As can be seen in the accompanying diagram , the parts are all interconnected . There is a 5V - 9V tiny battery attached to the Arduino pro mini . The gadget is powered up and tested once the connections have been established . For the time being , power up the device and place a hot item near the mpu6050 sensor to see whether the circuit and device work . After detecting the high temperature , the gadget indicates that the first symptom is positives1 + ( positives are shown ) . As a next step , place the max sensor on your arm and apply pressure . This will reduce your blood oxygen percentage , and the gadget will detect a low oxygen percentage and show the second positive symptom ( s2 + ) on the screen . VII . CONCLUSION To summarise , SARS - CoV - 2 , like other viruses in the Panic Zone , has wreaked havoc on the community . The majority of research conducted during the COVID - 19 outbreak focused on the virus ' s epidemiology and possible causes , whereas information on epidemic prevention was scarce . According to the information we ' ve gathered so far , diagnosing and treating patients as soon as the viruses break out in the Panic Zone is critical . The COVID - 19 epidemic has driven home how important it is to use our digital infrastructure to keep track of patients who can ' t be physically present . Because it measures Breath Shortness and Body Temperature , we may determine the severity of our illness at home prior to visiting the hospital using Covid 19 ' s main symptoms . If our health worsens and the gadget identifies that we are suffering from COPD , then the individual will be able to seek urgent medical attention .

In a future where everyone wears a face mask , the addition of a sensor to each mask may transform the way COVID - 19 distribution is monitored . To achieve this aim , a lot of work is required , but the international community as a whole should strive for it . REFERENCES 1 . Sethuraman , N . , Jeremiah , S . S . & Ryo , A .
