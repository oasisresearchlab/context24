S . A . HS1 ( haematopoieticlineagecell - speciﬁcgeneprotein1 ) , apromi - nent substrate of intracellular protein tyrosine kinases in haemato - poietic cells , is implicated in the immune response to extracellular stimuli and in cell diﬀerentiation induced by cytokines . Although HS1 contains a 37 - amino acid tandem repeat motif and a C - terminal Src homology 3 domain and is closely related to the cortical - actin - associated protein cortactin , it lacks the fourth repeat that has been shown to be essential for cortactin binding to ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) . In this study , we examined the possible role of HS1 in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton . Immunoﬂuorescent staining demonstrated that HS1 co - localizes in the cytoplasm of cells with actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 } 3 complex , the primary component of the cellular machinery INTRODUCTION The actin cytoskeleton plays a fundamental role in the function of haematopoietic cells , including antigen - mediated activation of lymphatic receptors [ 1 , 2 ] , platelet activation [ 3 ] and adhesion of leucocytes to vascular cells [ 4 ] . While signalling cascades from extracellular stimuli often lead to changes in the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton , the molecular mechanism by which the actin cytoskeleton is regulated in haematopoietic cells had not been known until the recent discovery of Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) and actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 } 3 complex [ 5 – 8 ] . Arp2 } 3 complex contains two actin - related subunits , Arp2 and Arp3 , and ﬁve other unique polypeptides [ 9 ] . Under physio - logical conditions , Arp2 } 3 complex binds to the side of an actin ﬁlament , serves as the nucleation site for the assembly of monomeric actin , and generates branched actin ﬁlaments , which compose a characteristic actin network , ﬁlling up the areas within cell leading edges including lamellipodia and membrane ruﬄes . However , the stimulation of the nucleation activity of Arp2 } 3 complex requires the function of WASP or its related proteins , which interact with and activate Arp2 } 3 complex upon binding to membrane - associated small GTPases such as Cdc42 [ 7 , 10 , 11 ] . Whereas WASP and small GTPases constitute an important pathway from extracellular signals to the actin net - work , other signalling molecules such as the non - receptor protein tyrosine kinase Src and its related proteins are also known to be implicated in the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton [ 12 ] . However , the key substrate ( s ) of the Src family kinases re - Abbreviations used : Arp , actin - related protein ; DTT , dithiothreitol ; F - actin , ﬁlamentous actin ; G - actin , globular actin ; GFP , green ﬂuorescent protein ; GST , glutathione S - transferase ; HS1 , haematopoietic lineage cell - speciﬁc gene protein 1 ; N - WASP , neural WASP ; SH3 , Src homology 3 ; VCA , verprolin – coﬁlin – acidic motif ; WASP , Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein . 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed , at the Department of Experimental Pathology , Jerome H .

Furthermore , recombi - nant HS1 binds directly to Arp2 } 3 complex with an equilibrium dissociation constant ( K d ) of 880 nM . Although HS1 is a modest F - actin - binding protein with a K d of 400 nM , it increases the rate ofthe actin assembly mediated by Arp2 } 3 complex , and promotes the formation of branched actin ﬁlaments induced by Arp2 } 3 complex and a constitutively activated peptide of N - WASP ( neural Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ) . Our data suggest that HS1 , like cortactin , plays an important role in the modu - lation of actin assembly . Key words : actin cytoskeleton haematopoietic cell , cortactin , tyrosine kinase , Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) . sponsible for cytoskeletal reorganization in haematopoietic cells remain unknown . HS1 ( haematopoietic lineage cell - speciﬁc gene protein 1 ) was originally isolated as a putative transcription factor exclusively expressed in haematopoietic cells [ 13 ] . However , subsequent studies indicate that HS1 is mainly a cytoplasmic protein and is often phosphorylated at tyrosine residues upon activation of membrane receptors including B - cell antigen receptor [ 14 , 15 ] , CD3 T - cell receptors [ 16 ] and Fc e RI of mast cells [ 17 ] . Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 is also concomitant with the activation of one or several intracellular protein tyrosine kinases such as Lck , Syk , Lyn , Fgr and TPK - IIB [ 14 , 18 – 21 ] . Direct association of HS1 with Lyn and Lck has been described in T - cells and during the diﬀerentiation of erythroid cells mediated by erythropoietin [ 15 , 19 , 22 , 23 ] . The physiological function of HS1 is further illustrated by the study of HS1 - knockout mice , which displayed a defect in antigen - induced proliferation and depletion of lymphocytes [ 24 ] . There is also evidence showing that HS1 is implicated in the apoptotic response to the activation of antigen receptors on lymphocytes , and lymphatic cells with low levels of HS1 expression have acquired a resistance to apoptosis [ 25 ] . Consistent with its role in apoptosis , HS1 is able to bind via its Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain to HAX , a Bcl - 2 - like protein [ 26 ] . HS1 contains 3 . 5 37 - amino acid tandem repeats and also an SH3 domain at the C - terminus . This structure is closely related to that of cortactin , an intracellular protein expressed primarily in adherent cells [ 27 , 28 ] . The amino acid sequences of the N - terminus , the repeat motif and the SH3 domain of HS1 share # 2003 Biochemical Society 486 T . Uruno and others Figure 1 Structural comparison of cortactin and HS1 ( A ) Schematic presentation of cortactin and HS1 . The N - terminal region , the 37 - amino acid repeat and SH3 domain are indicated with diﬀerent degrees of shading . ( B ) Alignment of the N - terminal sequence of human cortactin and human HS1 . Identical amino acids are indicated by dots between them . The DDW motif , which is essential for cortactin binding to Arp2 / 3 complex , is boxed . ( C ) Alignment of the repeats of human cortactin and human HS1 . Each repeat is denoted on the left by CortR or HS1R followed by a number corresponding to its position in the sequence . The consensus sequence , as deﬁned using residues with an occurrence of more than 50 % , is also shown . identities of over 65 % with those of cortactin ( Figure 1 ) , whereas the region between the repeat and the SH3 domain , which contains a putative a - helix , two or three phosphotyrosyl residues and a proline - rich region , is less conserved . Like HS1 , cortactin is also known to be implicated in growth - factor signal trans - duction and acts as a primary substrate of Src - related kinases [ 29 , 30 ] . Recent studies demonstrated further that cortactin is an Arp2 } 3 - complex stimulator and modulates the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton [ 31 , 32 ] . In (cid:138) i (cid:138) o , cortactin is tightly associated with the cortical actin and co - localizes with the Arp2 } 3 complex within punctated structures and the cell leading edge . In (cid:138) itro , cortactin binds directly to the Arp2 } 3 complex , enhances the actin nucleation activity of the Arp2 } 3 complex and promotes the formation of actin branches during actin polymerization [ 31 , 32 ] . The distinguishing structural feature of HS1 is that it contains only 3 . 5 repeat units , which is in contrast to the 5 . 5 or 6 . 5 repeat units frequently found in cortactin isoforms . Whereas the repeat domain of cortactin is known to be responsible for ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) binding , it requires at least 4 repeat units for F - actin binding [ 29 , 31 ] . In particular , the cortactin fourth repeat has been implicated in a direct interaction with F - actin [ 33 ] , which is apparently missing in HS1 . Therefore , the role of HS1 in the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton has not yet been established . In fact , a previous study was unable to determine a signiﬁcant level of HS1 associated with F - actin [ 34 ] , although its interaction with the actin cytoskeleton was assumed [ 35 ] . In the present study , we show that HS1 is able to bind to F - actin with modest aﬃnity compared with cortactin . Further - more , HS1 is able to interact directly with Arp2 } 3 complex and activate the Arp2 } 3 - complex - mediated actin nucleation and branching in a manner similar to cortactin . Thus our study indicates that modulating actin assembly is a common function with both cortactin and HS1 . MATERIALS AND METHODS Antibodies Monoclonal antibody against green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) was purchased from Molecular Probes . Polyclonal antibodies against a human Arp3 peptide and recombinant human HS1 tagged with glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) were prepared as described previously [ 31 , 34 ] . All polyclonal antibodies were puriﬁed by Protein A – Sepharose 4 Fast Flow ( Amersham Biosciences ) aﬃnity chromatography as described previously [ 30 ] . Plasmid construction Plasmid pGST - HS1 was constructed as described previously [ 34 ] . A His - tagged HS1 plasmid ( pQEHS1 ) was constructed by # 2003 Biochemical Society 487 Activation of actin polymerization by a protein tyrosine kinase substrate inserting a PCR - generated human HS1 DNA based on pGST - HS1 into the Bam HI and Sal I sites of pQE - 30 ( Qiagen ) . The pQEHS1 plasmid was selected in XL1 - Blue bacterial cells ( Strata - gene ) . The nucleotide sequence of the coding region was con - ﬁrmed by DNA sequencing . Plasmid pHS1 - GFP was prepared with the aid of PCR using pGST - HS1 as the template and the primers 5 « - AGCTCAGAATTCATGTGGAAGTCTGTAGTG - GGC - 3 « and 5 « - AGCTCAGTCGACCACTCCAGAAGCTTG - ACATA - 3 « . The resulting DNA fragment was inserted into Eco RI } Sal I sites of pEGFP1 - N1 ( Clontech ) . Preparation of GST - HS1 and His - HS1 proteins GST - HS1 was prepared as described previously [ 34 ] . To purify His - HS1 protein , XL1 - Blue cells harbouring the pQEHS1 plasmid were grown at 37 (cid:176) C to a density of D ’ ! ! ﬂ 0 . 6 , and expression was induced by adding 0 . 5 mM isopropyl b - d - thiogalactoside ( ‘IPTG’ ) followed by incubation at 34 (cid:176) C with constant shaking at 250 rev . } min for 4 h . The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 g for 20 min and resuspended in lysis buﬀer ( 50 mM NaH # PO % , pH 8 . 0 , 300 mM NaCl and 10 mM imidazole ) at a ratio of 4 ml } g ( wet weight ) . Lysozyme was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mg } ml and the lysate was subsequently incubated on ice for 30 min . The lysate was further subjected to sonication with an ultrasonic microprobe using a setting of six 10 s bursts at 200 – 300 W with a 10 s cooling period between each burst . After sonication , Triton X - 100 was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 % and the lysate was incubated on ice for 20 min . The lysate was then centrifuged at 10000 g for 20 min . The supernatant was mixed with 50 % ( v } v ) slurry of Ni # + - nitrilotriacetic acid ( ‘Ni - NTA’ ) resin and incubated for 1 h at 4 (cid:176) C in a rotator at 20 rev . } min . After washing with lysis buﬀer containing 20 mM imidazole , His - HS1 was eluted with the same buﬀer containing 250 mM imidazole . The eluate was loaded on to a Mono - Q column on a Waters 600 pump in 50 mM Tris } HCl , pH 7 . 5 , containing 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) and 1 mM EGTA , and eluted against a KCl gradient from 0 to 1 M in the same buﬀer at 1 ml } min . The major peak was collected and concentrated with Centricon - 10 ( Millipore ) . The concentration of puriﬁed protein was determined by the Bradford method using BSA as a standard . The puriﬁed His - HS1 protein was divided into small aliquots and stored at ﬁ 80 (cid:176) C . Puriﬁcation of Arp2 / 3 complex Arp2 } 3 complex was puriﬁed from bovine brain extracts by a two - step procedure as described in [ 7 ] with a modiﬁcation . Brieﬂy , frozen bovine brain ( 100 g ) was sliced with blades and homogenized with a dispersion device ( Polytron PT 2100 ; Kinematica AG ) on ice in 100 ml of buﬀer Q ( 20 mM Tris } HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 100 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl # , 5 mM EGTA and 1 mM DTT ) supplemented with 50 l g } ml PMSF , 5 l g } ml leupeptin and 1 l g } ml aprotinin . The homogenized sample was then clariﬁed by centrifugation at 125000 g for 90 min at 4 (cid:176) C , and the supernatant was subjected to chromatography in a 100 ml Q Sepharose column equilibrated with buﬀer Q . The ﬂow - through containing Arp2 } 3 complex was collected , supplemented with 0 . 1 mM ATP and fractionated on a GST - verprolin – coﬁlin – acidic motif ( VCA ) glutathione – Sepharose column equilibrated with buﬀer B ( 50 mM Tris } HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 25 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl # , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT and 0 . 1 mM ATP ) . After washing with 0 . 2 M KCl in buﬀer B , the Arp2 } 3 complex was eluted with buﬀer B containing 0 . 2 M MgCl # . The protein was then dialysed against buﬀer Q and further subjected to additional chromatography using Q Sepharose to remove residues of GST - VCA . The protein in the ﬂow - through fraction of the second Q Sepharose fractionation was concentrated by a Centricon - 30 ( Millipore ) , and the buﬀer was changed to Ca # + - free 1 ‹ poly - merization buﬀer ( 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl # , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 25 mM ATP , 10 mM Tris } HCl , pH 7 . 3 , 3 mM NaN $ and 0 . 5 mM DTT ) . Protein concentration was determined by Bradford method using BSA as the standard . Analysis of the interaction between HS1 and Arp2 / 3 complex Puriﬁed GST - HS1 ( 5 or 10 l g ) immobilized on glutathione – Sepharose ( Amersham Biosciences ) was mixed with 10 pmol of Arp2 } 3 complex in 500 l l of buﬀer A ( 50 mM Tris } HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl and 1 % Triton X - 100 ) , and incubated at 4 (cid:176) C on a rotating wheel for 90 min . After brief centrifugation , the beads were washed twice with buﬀer A and dissolved in 20 l l of 2 ‹ SDS loading buﬀer . The amount of Arp2 } 3 complex in the beads was quantiﬁed by immunoblotting using a polyclonal anti - Arp3 antibody after separation by SDS } PAGE . To analyse the aﬃnity of HS1 for Arp2 } 3 complex , puriﬁed Arp2 } 3 complex ( 4 nM ) was incubated with immobilized GST - HS1 at diﬀerent concentrations for 90 min at 4 (cid:176) C in binding buﬀer ( 50 mM Tris } HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM CaCl # , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 3 mM NaN $ , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl # , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mg } ml BSA and 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) . After incubation , samples were centrifuged at 800 g in a microcentrifuge for 10 s and the supernatants were then fractionated by SDS } PAGE ( 12 % , v } v , gels ) and immunoblotted with polyclonal anti - Arp3 antibody . The proteins that were reactive to Arp3 antibody were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ) with an optimal exposure time that yielded a near - linear detection range based on puriﬁed Arp2 } 3 complex at three known concentrations that were loaded on the same gel . The densities of Arp3 bands shown on the blot , which represented unbound Arp3 , were scanned and quantiﬁed with Scion Image software . The amounts of Arp3 depletion by diﬀerent concentrations of GST - HS1 were used to ﬁt a single rectangular hyperbola using GraphPad Prism 3 , and the K d value was calculated on the basis of V ﬂ V max C } ( K d › C ) , where V is the depletion of Arp3 proteins in the supernatant and C is the concentration of unbound HS1 . The same methodology was also used in the measurement of the aﬃnity for GST - VCA and GST - cortactin . Actin - polymerization assay Polymerization of globular actin ( G - actin ; 10 % pyrene - labelled ) was performed as described in [ 31 ] with a modiﬁcation . Brieﬂy , Ca # + ATP – G - actin in G - buﬀer ( 5 mM Tris } HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl # , 0 . 5 mM DTT and 0 . 2 mM ATP ) was converted into Mg # + ATP – G - actin by mixing with 0 . 1 vol . of 10 ‹ exchange buﬀer ( 2 mM EGTA } 1 mM MgCl # ) at 20 (cid:176) C for 2 min [ 36 – 38 ] . Actin polymerization was initiated by adding 60 l l of Mg # + ATP – G - actin ( 10 l M ) to 240 l l of 1 . 25 ‹ polymerization buﬀer ( 62 . 5 mM KCl , 2 . 5 mM MgCl # , 12 . 5 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 3 , 1 . 25 mM EGTA , 0 . 125 mM CaCl # , 0 . 625 mM DTT , 0 . 3125 mM ATP and 3 . 75 mM NaN $ ) in the presence of Arp2 } 3 complex and His - HS1 at the concentrations indicated . Actin assembly was monitored by measuring the increase in pyrene ﬂuorescence detected with an LS50B spectrophotometer ( Perkin Elmer ) with ﬁlters for excitation at 365 nm and emission at 407 nm . F - actin branching assay F - actin branching assay was based on a method that was described previously [ 39 ] . Brieﬂy , polymerization of 2 . 0 l M monomeric actin was initiated by 30 nM His - HS1 in the presence # 2003 Biochemical Society 488 T .

GST - VCA or GST - HS1 at various concentrations was mixed with 88 nM Arp2 / 3 complex as described in the Materials and methods section .

( B ) Comparison of the aﬃnity of GST - HS1 , GST - cortactin and GST - VCA for Arp2 / 3 complex . Puriﬁed Arp2 / 3 complex ( 4 . 4 nM ) was mixed with diﬀerent amounts of immobilized GST - HS1 , GST - cortactin or GST - VCA . After 90 min of incubation at 4 (cid:176) C , samples were centrifuged at 800 g for 10 s . The presence of Arp3 in the supernatants was detected by immunoblot with anti - Arp3 antibody . Amounts of Arp3 were quantiﬁed by digital scanning and normalized to the percentage of depletion . The resulting data were used to ﬁt a rectangular hyperbola , yielding apparent K d values of 881 , 647 and 115 nM for GST - HS1 , GST - cortactin and GST - VCA , respectively . ( C ) Immunoﬂuorescent staining of HS1 - GFP and Arp2 / 3 complex within macrophage cells . Raw 264 . 7 macrophage cells were transiently transfected with pHS1 - GFP . The transfected cells were ﬁxed and double - stained with monoclonal anti - GFP antibody ( panel a ) and polyclonal anti - Arp3 antibody ( panel b ) . The arrowheads indicate representative locations where HS1 - GFP and Arp3 were apparently co - localized . A non - transfected cell , as shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) , is indicated by an arrow . of 30 nM GST - VCA and 8 nM Arp2 } 3 complex . To visualize actin branches , a molar equivalent of rhodamine – phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) was added to the reaction solution at given times after initiation . Samples were diluted 400 - fold in fresh ﬂuorescence buﬀer ( 100 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl # , 100 mM DTT , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 3 , 0 . 5 % methylcellulose , 20 l g } ml catalase , 100 l g } ml glucose oxidase and 3 mg } ml glucose ) . Diluted samples ( 2 . 0 l l ) were applied on to coverslips precoated with 0 . 1 % nitrocellulose in n - amyl acetate . Actin ﬁlaments were examined by an Olympus IX - 70 inverted microscope using a 100 ‹ 1 . 35 NA objective lens . Images were captured with a digital camera controlled by the SPOT advance software . The digital images were processed with Adobe Photoshop to generate monochromatic images . Actin branches were quantiﬁed by measuring the density of branches ( number of branch points } ﬁlament length ) from ﬁve randomly selected images using Scion Image software . F - actin binding assay F - actin was prepared by incubating G - actin in polymerization buﬀer at room temperature for 4 h . To compare the F - actin binding ability of HS1 with cortactin , F - actin at diﬀerent concentrations was mixed with 30 nM His - HS1 or His - cortactin followed by incubation for 30 min at room temperature . The concentration of F - actin was calculated by the subtraction of 0 . 1 l M from the concentration of G - actin . The reaction solution was centrifuged at 200000 g for 30 min to pellet the bound proteins . The unbound His - HS1 or His - cortactin proteins in the supernatant were fractionated by SDS } PAGE and detected by immunoblotting using antibodies against HS1 or cortactin .

The cells at logarithmic phase were transfected with plasmids pHS1 - GFP or pEGFP1 - N1 with Superfect ( Qiagen ) . After 24 h , the transfected cells were plated on ﬁbronectin - coated glass coverslips in the growth medium . After an additional 12 h incubation , the cells were permeabilized by incubation for 20 s in 0 . 1 M Mes , pH 7 . 4 , containing 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM MgCl # , 1 mM EGTA and 4 % poly ( ethylene glycol ) 6000 . The permeabilized cells were subsequently ﬁxed for 30 min in 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde in PBS followed by three washes with PBS . The cells were then incubated for 30 min in PBS containing 2 % BSA followed by a 1 h incubation in the same buﬀer containing polyclonal anti - Arp3 antibody at a concentration of 50 l g } ml and monoclonal anti - GFP antibody at 10 l g } ml . After three washes with PBS , secondary antibodies ( rhodamine - conjugated anti - rabbit IgG and ﬂuorescein - con - jugated anti - mouse IgG antibodies ) were applied . After 1 h # 2003 Biochemical Society 489 Activation of actin polymerization by a protein tyrosine kinase substrate incubation , cells were washed with PBS and mounted in Prolong antifade solution ( Molecular Probes ) on a glass slide . The samples were examined by confocal laser microscopy using a Bio - Rad Radiance 2100 laser scanning system equipped with a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope . RESULTS HS1 interacts directly with Arp2 / 3 complex The interaction between HS1 and Arp2 } 3 complex was ﬁrst examined using a pull - down assay using GST - HS1 and puriﬁed Figure 3 HS1 promotes actin polymerization nucleated by Arp2 / 3 complex ( A ) Actin - polymerization analysis . Polymerization of 2 l M 10 % pyrene - labelled G - actin was initiated with 80 nM Arp2 / 3 complex and His - HS1 at the indicated concentrations . For comparison , 50 nM His - cortactin was also analysed in parallel . ( B ) His - HS1 alone does not have actin - assembly - promoting activity . The conditions were the same as in ( A ) except that His - HS1 was used at 80 nM and Arp2 / 3 complex at 14 nM .

( D ) Comparison of the aﬃnities of HS1 and cortactin for F - actin : 30 nM His - HS1 , His - cortactin or tag - free cortactin was co - precipitated with F - actin at concentrations ranging from 0 . 3 to 6 l M . The K d values were estimated as described in the Materials and methods section . The estimated K d for His - HS1 was 395 nM and that for either His - cortactin or tag - free cortactin was less than 100 nM . bovine Arp2 } 3 complex . As shown in Figure 2 ( A ) , GST - HS1 at concentrations ranging from 150 to 600 nM ( Figure 2A , lanes 3 – 5 ) was able to pull down readily 88 nM Arp2 } 3 complex as indicated by the presence of Arp3 , a subunit of Arp2 } 3 complex , in the pellets , whereas GST alone ( Figure 2A , lane 6 ) precipitated no detectable Arp3 as analysed by immunblot . Analysis of the Arp3 remaining in the supernatant after pull - down estimated a K d of 881 nM for the binding of GST - HS1 to Arp2 } 3 complex . This K d value is very similar to that of cortactin ( K d ﬂ 647 nM ) but signiﬁcantly greater than that of GST - VCA ( K d ﬂ 115 nM ) , a constitutively active peptide of human neural WASP ( N - WASP ; Figure 2B ) [ 7 ] . The similar aﬃnities of HS1 and cortactin # 2003 Biochemical Society 490 T . Uruno and others Figure 4 HS1 promotes the formation of stable F - actin branches ( A ) Actin polymerization was initiated by 8 nM Arp2 / 3 complex and 30 nM GST - VCA in the absence ( a , c ) or presence ( b , d ) of 30 nM His - HS1 . After 10 min ( a , b ) or 1 h ( c , d ) , rhodamine – phalloidin at molar concentrations equivalent to monomer actin was added . The labelled actin ﬁlaments were examined under a ﬂuorescent microscope . Scale bar ( d ) , 5 l m . Panel ( e ) , an enlarged image derived from ( b ) is shown on the left . On the right a sketch for the reconstruction of these branched actin complexes is presented . ( B ) Quantiﬁcation of HS1 - mediated actin branching . The branch density was calculated based on the ratio of the number of branching sites to the length of the ﬁlament in ﬁve randomly selected images from the same experiment as presented in ( A ) . Each data point was calculated based on the measurement of actin ﬁlaments of more than 200 l m in length . ( C ) Comparison of the actin branching activity of His - HS1 with His - cortactin . Actin branching was initiated in the presence of 8 nM Arp2 / 3 complex , 30 nM GST - VCA , and His - HS1 or His - cortactin at the indicated concentrations . The density of actin branching at each concentration was calculated based on the average branching sites counted from 200 l m actin ﬁlaments . for Arp2 } 3 complex is consistent with a conserved sequence of 63 % identity in their N - termini , which includes the DDW motif that has been demonstrated to be critical for cortactin binding to Arp2 } 3 complex ( Figure 1B ) [ 31 ] . The interaction of HS1 and Arp2 } 3 complex was further examined by analysing murine Raw 264 . 7 macrophage cells overexpressing a form of human HS1 tagged with GFP at its C - terminus ( HS1 - GFP ) . The cellular distributions of HS1 - GFP and endogenous Arp2 } 3 complex were analysed by immuno - ﬂuorescence staining with a monoclonal anti - GFP antibody and polyclonal anti - Arp3 antibody , respectively . As shown in Figure 2 ( C ) , both HS1 - GFP and Arp3 are found in punctate - like structures enriched within the cell periphery and the cytoplasm . In many punctates , co - localization of HS1 - GFP and Arp3 is evident . The speciﬁcity of the staining was veriﬁed by negative GFP staining of a non - transfected cell as indicated by an arrow ( Figure 2C , panels a and b ) and cells expressing GFP only ( results not shown ) . HS1 promotes actin assembly nucleated by Arp2 / 3 complex Arp2 } 3 complex is a primary cellular factor involved in actin nucleation , a rate - limiting step for de no (cid:138) o synthesis of actin ﬁlaments [ 9 ] . Therefore , we determined whether binding of HS1 to Arp2 } 3 complex had any inﬂuence on actin assembly . The eﬀect of HS1 on the nucleation activity of Arp2 } 3 complex was evaluated by measuring the polymerization of pyrene - labelled G - actin . The rate of actin polymerization was apparently enhanced in the presence of both His - HS1 and Arp2 } 3 complex ( Figure 3A ) . Half - maximal actin polymerization was reached within 600 s in the presence of 50 nM His - HS1 and 80 nM Arp2 } 3 . However , the rate of His - HS1 - stimulated actin growth appeared # 2003 Biochemical Society 491 Activation of actin polymerization by a protein tyrosine kinase substrate to be lower than that of His - cortactin , which was able to induce half - maximal stimulation in approx . 300 s under the same conditions ( Figure 3A ) . The apparent activity of His - HS1 in actin assembly was probably due to its interaction with Arp2 } 3 complex because no signiﬁcant increase in actin polymerization was detected in the presence of either Arp2 } 3 ( Figure 3A ) or His - HS1 alone ( Figure 3B ) . The activities of HS1 and cortactin were also compared by their dose - dependent stimulation of half - maximal actin assembly ( t " # ; Figure 3C ) . Whereas His - cortactin has an apparent higher potency than His - HS1 , both proteins showed 50 % stimulation at a concentration near 25 nM and maximal stimulation at 50 nM . Thus , like cortactin , HS1 has apparently a high functional eﬃcacy for Arp2 } 3 complex during actin polymerization although its binding aﬃnity for Arp2 } 3 is low . HS1 is a modest F - actin - binding protein Cortactin is known as a potent F - actin - binding protein through its repeat domain , and its aﬃnity for F - actin appears to be crucial for its stimulation of Arp2 } 3 - mediated actin assembly [ 31 ] . The apparent activity of HS1 to stimulate Arp2 } 3 complex suggests that HS1 may be an F - actin - binding protein as well . However , HS1 has a short repeat domain ( 3 . 5 37 - amino acid tandem repeats ) and its ability to bind to F - actin has not yet been established . We examined the interaction of HS1 with F - actin by co - precipitation of His - HS1 and F - actin and quantiﬁed the interaction by plotting co - precipitated HS1 as a function of F - actin concentration ( Figure 3D ) . This analysis estimated the K d of His - HS1 for F - actin binding to be approx . 395 nM . In a parallel experiment , we also measured the aﬃnity of His - cortactin for F - actin and estimated the K d of His - cortactin at less than 100 nM ( Figure 3D ) . A precise prediction of the K d value for His - cortactin has not been achieved because the critical concentration of actin , approx . 100 nM under typical conditions for F - actin binding , put a limit on the lowest amount of F - actin available for measuring the aﬃnity of His - cortactin . The possible eﬀect of the His tag was ruled out by comparing His - cortactin and tag - free cortactin , both of which showed identical aﬃnity for F - actin ( Figure 3D ) and actin assembly ( results not shown ) . Thus , in spite of the lack of a fourth repeat , HS1 is an F - actin - binding protein but with modest aﬃnity compared with cortactin . HS1 promotes the formation of a branched actin network A hallmark of the actin polymerization initiated by Arp2 } 3 complex is the formation of characteristic branched actin net - work , an activity that can be signiﬁcantly enhanced by cortactin [ 32 ] . To examine whether HS1 has a similar branching activity as cortactin , actin polymerization was initiated by adding His - HS1 , Arp2 } 3 complex and GST - VCA . GST - VCA was included in this study to fully activate the Arp2 } 3 complex and facilitate the measurement of the activity of HS1 for actin branching . After either 10 min or 1 h of initiation , actin was labelled with rhodamine – phalloidinandexaminedbyﬂuorescencemicroscopy . Although many branched actin ﬁlaments in the presence of Arp2 } 3 complex and GST - VCA were readily detected at an early time ( 10 min ; Figure 4A , panel a ) , longer and less - branched actin ﬁlaments became dominant after 1 h incubation ( Figure 4A , panel c ) , presumably due to a debranching process followed by an annealing reaction [ 39 ] . Quantitative analysis based on the branch density also indicated that about two - thirds of the actin ﬁlaments formed without His - HS1 had undergone the de - branching process after 1 h ( Figure 4B ) . In contrast , the presence of His - HS1 yielded short and highly branched actin ﬁlaments with a density 1 . 8 - fold higher than that formed in the absence of His - HS1 at 10 min and 4 - fold higher at 1 h ( Figure 4B ) . The branching activity of His - HS1 was also compared with that of His - cortactin at diﬀerent concentrations after 1 h of actin assembly . While the maximal actin branch density induced by His - HS1 appeared to be lower than that of His - cortactin by nearly 50 % , both proteins were able to show a half - maximal stimulation near 25 nM and reach to a plateau at 100 nM ( Figure 4C ) . DISCUSSION The data presented here demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that HS1 , a prominent substrate of intracellular protein tyrosine kinases in haematopoietic cells , may play a role in actin polymerization by its direct association with Arp2 } 3 complex , the primary com - ponentofthecellularmachineryforactinassembly . Recombinant HS1 is able to bind to the Arp2 } 3 complex , and promote Arp2 } 3 - mediatedactin assembly and actin branching , the activity that is also observed with cortactin , the only protein in mam - malian cells that shares signiﬁcant sequence identity with HS1 . However , the in (cid:138) i (cid:138) o function of HS1 and cortactin may not be necessarily redundant because each of them shows a very distinct expression pattern . While HS1 is exclusively expressed in haematopoietic cells , cortactin is more frequently found in adherent types of cell . In addition , HS1 displays a relatively lower activity for the stimulation of actin nucleation and actin branching compared with cortactin . Such modest activity of HS1 may have a physiological function for haematopoietic cells , which have distinct morphology adapted to their circulation in blood vessels and interaction with vascular cells . Indeed , ex - pression of cortactin in bone marrow is very restricted within limited types of cell , such as megakaryocytes and platelets , which have a characteristically large volume of cytoplasm and are ready to challenge stimuli for shape changes [ 28 ] . It is noteworthy that the WASP family , which currently includes WASP , N - WASP , WAVE1 , WAVE2 and WAVE3 , also shows a tissue - speciﬁc expression pattern for each of its members [ 9 , 40 ] . While WASP is exclusively expressed in haematopoietic cells , N - WASP is mostly found in a variety of adherent cells , particularly in the brain . In addition , each WASP member activates Arp2 } 3 - dependent actin nucleation with diﬀerential eﬃciencies , with the strongest activity found with N - WASP [ 41 , 42 ] . Thus it seems that haematopoietic cells encompass a unique actin - polymeri - zation system that involves HS1 , WASP and the Arp2 } 3 complex . Characterization of the actin network assembled by these molecules may eventually illustrate a unique cytoskeleton more suitable for haematopoietic cells that circulate in the blood . The apparent aﬃnity of HS1 for Arp2 } 3 complex is sig - niﬁcantly lower than that of GST - VCA , as analysed in the absence of actin . Interestingly , HS1 is able to induce half - maximal stimu - lation of Arp2 } 3 - dependent actin polymerization and actin branching at a concentration near 25 nM ( Figures 3C and 4C ) . However , the aﬃnity of HS1 for Arp2 } 3 , as determined by direct binding assay , was near 900 nM ( Figure 2B ) . This apparent discrepancy between functional and binding aﬃnity is also observed with cortactin ( Figure 2B ; see also [ 31 ] ) . One plausible explanation is that HS1 may acquire a higher aﬃnity for Arp2 } 3 complex upon actin assembly . Indeed , a dramatic change in the conﬁguration of Arp2 } 3 complex induced by WASP - related peptides has been postulated based on structural studies [ 43 , 44 ] . Such structural changes may inﬂuence the interaction between HS1 and Arp2 } 3 complex . Supporting this possibility is the observation that activated Arp2 } 3 complex is integrated with newly assembled F - actin at branched points , where cortactin and # 2003 Biochemical Society 492 T . Uruno and others WASP are apparently involved [ 31 , 32 , 45 ] . Alternatively , F - actin , especially newly assembled actin ﬁlaments , could also play a role in the regulation of the interaction between HS1 and Arp2 } 3 complex . Distinguishing these possibilities will require further delineation of the mechanism for actin polymerization and illustration of the structure of branched actin . In addition to binding to Arp2 } 3 complex , HS1 shows a signiﬁcant aﬃnity for F - actin with an estimated K d of 400 nM . Under the same conditions , we measured the K d for cortactin to be less than 100 nM , which is slightly less than that estimated in previous studies [ 29 , 31 ] . This apparent discrepancy might be due to the improved methodology used in the current study , in which a low concentration ( 30 nM ) of His - cortactin and freshly pre - pared F - actin were used . It has been reported that the repeat domain of cortactin is responsible for F - actin binding [ 29 ] . Particularly , the fourth repeat may participate in a direct interaction with F - actin because a series of truncated mutants lacking this repeat failed to show any F - actin binding activity [ 33 ] . However , HS1 contains only 3 . 5 repeats and lacks the fourth repeat found in cortactin . Thus binding of the cortactin family to F - actin seems not to be exclusively dependent on the existence of a particular repeat . It is more likely that F - actin binding requires a correct conﬁguration of the repeat domain as a whole , which may be determined by both the number of repeats and their positions relative to F - actin at branching sites . Indeed , the sequence of the HS1 } cortactin repeat unit is extremely conserved ( Figure 1C ) . It is also possible that sequence elements other than the repeat domain of HS1 may also contribute to its F - actin binding activity . It is worth noting that the sequence that lies between the repeat and the SH3 domain of HS1 is much less conserved and shares only 25 % identity with that of cortactin . This may reﬂect a diﬀerent mechanism for the regulation of each protein in (cid:138) i (cid:138) o and may impose diﬀerent restrictions on their overall conﬁgurations as well .
