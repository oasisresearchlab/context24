HA was recovered in DIGs from DIGs , several apical cargo proteins such as the upon surface arrival and stayed detergent insoluble even inﬂuenza virus haemagglutinin ( HA ) and neuraminidase after prolonged chase times ( Figure 1 ) . Note that the two ( NA ) , brush border enzymes and GPI - anchored proteins proteins on the autoradiograph besides HA and NA bind are found in DIGs during transport to the cell surface unspeciﬁcally to the streptavidin – agarose , as they are ( Simons and Ikonen , 1997 ) . In all cases , the apical proteins already recovered after 2 min of chase , whereas HA and are soluble in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , but become NA reached the surface after 30 min of chase as expected . resistant to TX - 100 after transport to the Golgi complex When TX - 100 instead of CHAPS was used , similar results ( Fiedler et al . , 1993 ; Danielsen , 1995 ; Kundu et al . , 1996 ; were obtained ( data not shown ) . It is unlikely , therefore , Simons and Ikonen , 1997 ) . that detergent insolubility of HA reﬂects a complex Here we have analysed the mechanism of raft association formation with the anterograde or retrograde proteinaceous of HA as a model protein to understand how transmem - delivery machinery . Like HA , NA also stayed insoluble brane proteins can be coupled to raft lipids . We postulate at the cell surface ( Figure 1 ) . In order to ﬁnd out if raft that determinants required for association with the lipid association requires cellular proteins , we next examined microdomain will also be important for apical transport the solubility of HA in isolated inﬂuenza virus particles . and signal transduction processes involving sphingolipid – The viral envelope contains only two major transmembrane cholesterol rafts . proteins , HA and NA , embedded in lipids derived from the plasma membrane . The virus particle therefore provides Results a simple and homogeneous system , allowing quantitative analysis of lipid and protein interactions . When viruses Detergent insolubility of HA is an intrinsic were extracted with TX - 100 at 4°C , ~ 70 % of the HA was property of the molecule found in the pellet whereas it was soluble at 37°C ( Figure We ﬁrst analysed whether raft association of HA is 2A ) . To show that the observed insolubility is not due to only transient during interaction with the apical transport protein – protein interactions between HA and the nucleo - machinery or persists after surface arrival . In a pulse – chase capsid ( NP ) and matrix protein ( M ) , detergent extracts prepared at 4°C were loaded in the bottom of a TX - 100 - containing sucrose gradient . After centrifugation , deter - gent - insoluble HA and NA were recovered in low density fractions , whereas NP and M were found in the pellet because they do not associate with DIGs ( Figure 2B ) . When extracts prepared at 37°C were analysed , HA and NA were found in the bottom fraction ( data not shown ) . These experiments demonstrate that HA is found in DIGs and associates with raft lipids even in the absence of cellular proteins . Fig . 1 . HA stays insoluble after reaching the plasma membrane .

However , when cells were pre - treated with 10 mM CD , HA could be fully solubilized in TX - 100 at 4°C ( Figure 4 , lanes 1 – 4 ) . Note that also in terol is enriched in DIGs ( Brown and Rose , 1992 ; Simons and Ikonen , 1997 ) . In order to demonstrate directly the cholesterol - depleted cells , HA was transported efﬁciently to the Golgi complex , as indicated by its terminally involvement of cholesterol , we decided to analyse raft association of HA in cholesterol - depleted membranes . glycosylated form ( Figure 4 , lane 3 ) . The extent of the cholesterol depletion in tissue culture cells under these Methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( CD ) has been shown before to be a useful tool with which to extract cholesterol from conditions is 50 – 65 % of the total cellular cholesterol ( A . G . Rietveld and K . Simons , unpublished ) , but as the biological membranes with high preference over other lipid species ( Klein et al . , 1995 ; Yancey et al . , 1996 ) . For cellular membranes are heterogeneous this does not allow conclusions about the HA - containing membranes . a titration experiment , [ 3 H ] cholesterol - labelled inﬂuenza viruses were prepared and treated with increasing concen - In order to ﬁnd out whether loss of raft association after cholesterol depletion occurs only for HA or is due trations of CD . Subsequently , virus particles were collected by centrifugation and cholesterol was quantiﬁed .

We 2 . 5 or 10 mM removed 59 (cid:3) 4 % or 92 (cid:3) 1 % of the cholesterol from the virus particle , respectively ( Figure transiently transfected BHK cells with cDNAs encoding the GPI - anchored placental alkaline phosphatase ( PLAP ) 3A ) . The cholesterol - depleted virus particles were then subjected to extraction with TX - 100 at 4°C . The solubility and the doubly acylated src - like kinase fyn . While in untreated cells both proteins were partially insoluble as of HA increased from 32 (cid:3) 9 % in the untreated viruses to 54 (cid:3) 9 % or 85 (cid:3) 11 % after treatment with 2 . 5 or described before ( Brown and Rose , 1992 ; Shenoy - Scaria et al . , 1994 ; Gorodinsky and Harris , 1995 ) , PLAP was 10 mM CD , respectively ( Figure 3B ) . Consistently , no protein was found ﬂoating in TX - 100 density gradients not found in DIGs after cholesterol depletion , in agreement with previous studies ( Cerneus et al . , 1993 ; Hanada et al . , ( data not shown ) . We next analysed the solubility of HA in cholesterol - depleted cellular membranes . Baby hamster 1995 ) ( Figure 4 , lanes 5 – 8 ) . The insolubility of fyn was decreased reproducibly from 70 to 33 % , as quantiﬁed by kidney ( BHK ) cells were transiently transfected with HA cDNA . In a pulse – chase experiment , the terminally phosphor imager analysis ( Figure 4 , lanes 9 – 12 ) . The less dramatic effect on raft association of fyn might be due to modiﬁed ( Golgi ) form of HA was recovered in DIGs whereas the ER form ( lower band ) was soluble as described less efﬁcient removal of cholesterol from the inner leaﬂet 5503 P . Scheiffele , M . G . Roth and K . Simons of the membrane . However , the experiment demonstrates that association with the glycosphingolipid - free cytosolic surface of rafts also requires membrane cholesterol . Cho - lesterol depletion might generally abolish protein binding to sphingolipid – cholesterol rafts or even disrupt the micro - domains . However , endogenous caveolin - 1 could not be solubilized in TX - 100 using the protocol described ( Figure 4 , lanes 13 – 16 ) . This suggests that cholesterol depletion from caveolin - 1 - containing membrane domains is not achieved under the conditions used , probably because caveolin - 1 itself binds tightly to cholesterol ( Murata et al . , 1995 ) , but also other interactions might confer insolubility to caveolin - 1 , such as homo - and hetero - oligomerization of the caveolins ( Monier et al . , 1995 , 1996 ) . Raft association of HA requires a determinant in the TMD The ability of the HA molecule to associate directly with lipid microdomains must be encoded in the protein structure . The most likely candidate region is the mem - brane anchor of HA which might allow partitioning into a raft lipid environment , either by its physical properties for packing with lipids in the microdomain or by binding directly to a raft lipid ( Murata et al . , 1995 ) . We analysed chimeric HA molecules containing lumenal and cyto - plasmic domains of HA with transmembrane domains ( TMDs ) from molecules which should not associate with sphingolipid – cholesterol rafts ( Simons and Ikonen , 1997 ) : one with the TMD of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein ( HGH , Figure 5A ) and another with that of the herpes Fig . 5 . Raft association of HA depends on amino acids in the simplex virus C protein ( HCH , Figure 5A ) ( Srinivas et al . , transmembrane domain . ( A ) HA mutants were constructed containing luminal and cytoplasmic domains of the wild - type protein ( wtHA ) and 1986 ) . HCH has been shown to trimerize and to be transmembrane sequences of VSV G ( HGH ) or HSV gC ( HCH ) . In transported to the plasma membrane with kinetics similar the mutants 4A511 – 5A531 , sets of two or four amino acids in the HA to that of the wild - type HA ( wtHA ) molecule , whereas TMD were replaced by alanines ( bold and underlined ) . The three trimerization and surface transport of HGH were found to cysteines in the cytoplasmic tail and TMD of wtHA are palmitoylation sites . ( B ) Detergent solubility of endoglycosidase H - resistant HA ( R ) occur with slower kinetics ( Lazarovits et al . , 1990 ) . The and - sensitive HA ( S ) forms of HA mutants . Proteins were transiently mutants were expressed transiently in BHK ﬁbroblasts expressed in BHK cells and pulse - labelled with [ 35 S ] methionine . After and analysed in pulse – chase experiments . After a 60 min a 60 min chase , cells were extracted with 1 % TX - 100 at 4°C and HA chase , the HA mutant proteins were immunoprecipitated was immunoprecipitated from soluble ( S ) and insoluble fractions ( P ) . and digested with endoglycosidase H to distinguish ER After digestion with endoglycosidase H , proteins were analysed by gel electrophoresis . and Golgi forms . Neither chimeric protein partitioned into DIGs , whereas the wtHA acquired TX - 100 insolubility in the Golgi complex , as previously observed ( Skibbens extent to the wtHA ( 2A517 , 4A524 , 4A528 , 5A531 ) ( Figure 5B ) . There is a strict requirement for amino acids et al . , 1989 ) ( Figure 5B ) . Therefore , swapping the TMDs caused the protein to lose its ability to interact with in contact with the exoplasmic leaﬂet of the membrane , but changes in residues contacting the cytoplasmic leaﬂet sphingolipid – cholesterol rafts . The TMDs of HCH and HGH are signiﬁcantly shorter than that of the wtHA ( 23 are tolerated . It is therefore not simply the length of the TMD which inﬂuences interaction with sphingolipid – or 20 amino acids , respectively , versus 27 in wtHA ) , and it has been proposed that the length of the membrane - cholesterol rafts , but rather a speciﬁc determinant in the exoplasmic half of the TMD . The most important residues spanning domain can determine Golgi localization of transmembrane proteins by excluding them from mem - identiﬁed by the mutagenesis are large and hydrophobic , with the glycine / serine in mutant 2A520 as the only branes with increased bilayer thickness ( Bretscher and Munro , 1993 ) . In order to ﬁnd out whether raft association exception . is inﬂuenced by the length of the TMD or rather by a more speciﬁc feature in the membrane anchor , we analysed Palmitoylation of the mutant HA 4A511 is not affected additional mutant HA molecules with unaltered TMD length , changing blocks of two or four amino acids in the Besides the TMD , HA is also anchored to the membrane by palmitoylation on three cysteine residues ( Naim et al . , TMD to alanines ( Figure 5A ) . All mutants were expressed transiently in BHK cells and analysed in pulse – chase 1992 ) which might inﬂuence raft association . To rule out an indirect effect of the TMD mutations on palmitoylation , experiments , followed by TX - 100 extraction and immuno - precipitation of HA ( Figure 5B ) . Some mutants were we analysed the incorporation of [ 3 H ] palmitic acid in wtHA , the mutant 4A511 and HCH , which is lacking one soluble ( 4A511 , 2A511 , 2A514 , 2A520 ) whereas others were recovered in DIGs to a slightly lower or similar of the palmitoylation sites in the TMD ( see Figure 5A ) . 5504 Protein binding of cholesterol - rich domains that binding to the cytoplasmic surface of rafts occurs by a mechanism similar to binding of GPI - anchored proteins . However , glycosphingolipids are restricted to the exo - plasmic leaﬂet of the bilayer , and the lipids specifying rafts in the intracellular leaﬂet still remain to be identiﬁed . Cholesterol must also exist in ‘non - raft’ regions of cellular membranes ( Chong , 1994 ) , but in the context of raft lipids , cholesterol appears to be complexed as indicated by its detergent insolubility , whereas cholesterol as such or incorporated in phosphatidylcholine - containing ( ‘non - raft’ ) liposomes is soluble ( Schroeder et al . , 1994 ) . We propose that raft integrity and protein association depend on the presence of cholesterol and that cholesterol deple - Fig . 6 . Solubility of HA 4A511 is not caused by decreased tion can be used as an additional criterion for testing palmitoylation . Proteins were expressed as described in Figure 5 , but whether proteins speciﬁcally associate with the lipid labelling was performed with [ 3 H ] palmitic acid . Cell lysates were treated with endoglycosidase H to differentiate between resistant microdomains . This appears even more important as [ HA ( R ) ] and sensitive forms [ HA ( S ) ] . Samples were split and either in vitro studies demonstrated that some glycosphingolipids analysed directly by Western blotting with polyclonal HA antibodies are intrinsically detergent insoluble ( Schroeder et al . , ( left panel ) or immunoprecipitated with the same antibody and 1994 ) , but in biological membranes they will require analysed by ﬂuorography ( right panel ) . Similar results were obtained when quantiﬁcation of the expression level was performed by labelling cholesterol to form rafts with the ability to bind speciﬁc with [ 35 S ] methionine on a separate dish instead of Western blotting . proteins . Cholesterol is thought to increase the thickness of the lipid bilayer , and lipids with long acyl chains have been The expression level of the proteins was determined by Western blotting of an aliquot of the samples ( Figure 6 , found enriched in DIGs ( Bretscher and Munro , 1993 ; Schroeder et al . , 1994 ) . However , so far there is no left panel ) . Mutant 4A511 HA incorporated essentially the same amount of [ 3 H ] palmitic acid as the wtHA whereas , evidence which would support increased bilayer thickness as an important characteristic for protein association with in agreement with the lack of one palmitoylation site , HCH was labelled signiﬁcantly less ( ~ 25 % decrease of sphingolipid – cholesterol rafts ( see below ) . palmitic acid signal per protein unit according to densito - metric scanning ; Figure 6 , right panel ) . Therefore , it is Transmembrane domains as determinants for raft association unlikely that the loss of raft association of the TMD mutants is due to a change in acylation , but rather reﬂects Membrane - spanning domains have been implicated in different steps of protein trafﬁcking , such as retrieval and deletion of a TMD determinant required for protein – lipid interactions . retention of proteins in the ER or the Golgi complex . In many cases , formation of hetero - or homo - oligomers mediated by the TMDs was proposed to be the mechanism Discussion for TMD involvement ( Machamer et al . , 1993 ; Munro , 1995 ; Nilsson , 1996 ) . Also , in yeast , protein – protein In this study , we analysed the interaction of a type I transmembrane protein with sphingolipid – cholesterol interactions within the membrane plane have been postu - lated to be required for ER retrieval .

It has been reported previously that HA is found in DIGs after transport to the Golgi complex , and this has transmembrane protein , is employed to retrieve proteins with a TMD signal from the cis - Golgi .

This is conﬁrmed further by the fact teins with rafts employs direct protein – lipid interactions , as HA in isolated virus particles in the absence of cellular that cholesterol depletion from cells or virus particles abolishes incorporation into DIGs and leads to subsequent proteins is found in DIGs ( Figure 2B ) . Crucial amino acids identiﬁed by the mutagenesis were mostly hydrophobic solubilization of HA in TX - 100 at 4°C . residues in the exoplasmic half of the TMD . These hydrophobic amino acids could shape the TMD in the Cholesterol as a raft lipid The model for raft structure postulates an important role right way to be accommodated with cholesterol in the microdomain , rather than being employed in direct binding for cholesterol as a spacer to link sphingolipids together in the exoplasmic leaﬂet of the bilayer ( Simons and to one lipid species . This is consistent with the dynamic nature of rafts ( Harder and Simons , 1997 ) . The structural Ikonen , 1997 ) . Our results conﬁrm that cholesterol is crucial for raft association of a transmembrane and two role of this TMD determinant is underlined by the fact that fusion of the normally trimeric HA TMD and the lipid - modiﬁed proteins . Previous studies have already suggested a role for cholesterol in raft association of GPI - cytoplasmic tail to a dimeric molecule , PLAP , yields a detergent - soluble protein ( Arreaza and Brown , 1995 ) . This anchored proteins ( Cerneus et al . , 1993 ; Hanada et al . , 1995 ; Hannan and Edinin , 1996 ) . Interestingly , fyn binds could be due to a change from a trimer to a dimer leading to looser intercalation into the microdomain . However , it to the lipid microdomain in a cholesterol - dependent manner from the cytoplasmic side . This could indicate is possible that the context of the TMD also will be 5505 P .

Restriction enzymes were from Boehringer Mannheim ( Germany ) and were used according to the manufacturer’s One consequence of our ﬁndings is that determinants instructions . for raft association will be an important factor specifying function of a protein .
