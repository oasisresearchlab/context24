Children and the return to school : how much should we worry about covid - 19 and long covid ? Daniel M Altmann professorofimmunologyRosemaryJBoytonprofessorofimmunologyandrespiratory medicine Amongtheunknownsthathavefeaturedinthesteeplearningcurveofourcovid - 19 year , the question of risksto ( andfrom ) childrenhasbeenanongoingarea ofuncertainty . Atfirst , theconundrumthattheyoung seemed so little affected by the infection prompted atleastoneworldleadertopronouncethattheywere“somehowimmune . ” A year into the pandemic we have a much clearer perspective , especially from random testing surveys suchasR , seroprevalencestudies , andcontacttracing studies . The overwhelming observation has been that , across the pandemic , children and adolescents are considerably less likely to be affected by severe diseaseortobeadmittedtohospital . Intransmission tracing studies , children are roughly half as likely as adultstobecomeinfected . 1 Whilethisisstillthecase , during the latest wave the age distribution of cases has shifted downwards . In general , child and adolescent cases account for nomorethanafewpercentofreported , symptomatic cases and few severe or fatal cases . The difference may partly relate to the lower expression of angiotensinconvertingenzyme2inyoungerchildren . However , seroprevalence is similar between adolescentsandadults , suggestingahighprevalence of asymptomatic spread in the former group . 12 Since access to testing has mostly been predicated on presence of case defining symptoms ( and these have been defined in adults where they are likely to be more explicit ) , the likelihood is that the caseload in children has been underestimated . This seems to be confirmed by comparison between unbiased population sampling ( such as the React study ) and symptom based surveys . 2 Theclinicalpresentationandimmuneprofileinthosechildrenwhoareadmittedtohospitalseemssimilartothediseaseinadults . Anexceptiontothisisasmall subset who develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children ( MIS - C ) —a disease of vascular involvement , shock , and strong T cell activation . Where does this leave us in terms of evaluating risks—both to and from children—around the return to school ? The first point to consider is whether the high seroprevalence among adolescents offers potentialhubsofsuper - spreadersforthecommunity . Certainly , in those children who become sufficiently unwell for hospital admission , viral load reaches much higher levels than seen in adults , though it is unclear whether these high levels are also seen in asymptomatic disease . While some reported contact tracing studies in schools identified relatively little spread , others show that teachers engaged in face - to - faceteachinghaveroughlytwicetheinfection risk of those teaching online . 3 - 5 Also , the data indicatethatjumpsintheRvaluehavefollowedtermdaterestartsincountrieswherechildrenhavebeenatschoolduringthepandemic . 6 This scenario is reminiscent of the role played by children in transmission of winter flu—they are relatively unlikely to have severe disease , but can play a significant role in spread to the community and to older relatives . Arguably the biggest unknown is the evaluation of risk of developing long covid during asymptomatic spreadinaschoolsetting . Estimatingtheprevalence of long covid in adults remains a challenge , and for childrenandadolescentsconsiderablymoreso . Until more detailed studies are completed , evidence of the total long covid caseload appears to lie somewhere between the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) estimate of around 10 % and some research cohort studies that tend to put it considerably higher . The ONS data also indicate that around 79 000 of those in the UK with long covid are under the age of 19 . Most of the symptoms described at www . longcovid - kids . org are like those reported by adults : fatigue , shortness of breath , joint pain , rashes , and headaches . Given the strong imperative to get children back into full time , face - to - face teaching after the disruptions of the past year , the key challenge is to maximally offset the risks of community transmission and paediatric cases of covid - 19 and long covid . Analysis has shown that the protective impact of mitigation measuresiscumulativeasoneaddsinmaskwearing , ventilation , regular testing , small class sizes , and spaced classrooms . The next few weeks will pose enormous logistical challenges for heads and teachers . Luckily this is happening as we head into spring , with potential to make use of outdoor teachinganddining . Afterthat , itwillbetimetostart planning for the extension of vaccination programmes into schools .
