Despite a high level of sequence and structure conservation , subtle changes in their design principles 18 determine the interaction with myosin motors and actin - binding proteins . The functional diversity is 19 further increased by posttranslational modifications ( PTMs ) . Therefore , identifying how the structure of 20 actin isoforms relates to function is important for our understanding of normal cytoskeletal physiology . 21 Here , we report the high - resolution structures of filamentous skeletal a - actin ( 3 . 37Å ) , cardiac a - actin 22 ( 3 . 07Å ) , ß - actin ( 2 . 99Å ) , and g - actin ( 3 . 38Å ) in the Mg 2 + ·ADP state with their native PTMs . The 23 structures revealed isoform - specific conformations of the N - terminus that shifts closer to the filament 24 surface upon myosin binding , thereby establishing isoform - specific interfaces . Retropropagated structural 25 changes further show that myosin binding modulates actin filament structure . Further , our structures 26 enabled us to reveal the location of disease - causing mutations and to analyze them with respect to known 27 locations of PTMs . Collectively , the previously unknown structures of single - isotype , posttranslationally 28 modified bare cardiac a - actin , ß - actin , and g - actin reveal general principles , similarities , and differences 29 between isoforms . They complement the repertoire of known actin structures and allow for a 30 comprehensive understanding of in vitro and in vivo functions of actin isoforms . 31 32 2 Introduction 1 2 Actin isoforms are among the most ubiquitous and abundant structural proteins that facilitate the 3 functional organization of the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells ( 1 , 2 ) . Humans express six actin genes in a 4 tissue - specific and developmentally - regulated manner ( 3 ) . The gene products are structurally and 5 functionally conserved among eukaryotes and can be grouped into four muscle actins ( skeletal a - actin , 6 smooth a - actin ( vascular ) , and cardiac a - actin , smooth g - actin ( enteric ) ) and two nonmuscle actins ( ß - 7 actin and g - actin ) ( 4 , 5 ) . Actin isoforms display differential biochemistries , cellular localization , and 8 interactions with myosin motors and actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) ( 2 , 3 , 6 - 10 ) . These characteristics 9 result in the formation of diverse cellular actin networks with distinct compositions , architectures , 10 dynamics , and mechanics that enable fundamental processes such as cell adhesion , migration , and 11 contractility ( 1 , 11 , 12 ) . Actin isoforms share a high sequence identity at the protein level ( ~ 93 - 99 % ) and 12 the ability to self - assemble into helical , polarized filaments ( F - actin ) from monomers ( G - actin ) ( 2 , 13 - 15 ) . 13 Since the publication of the first crystal structure of G - actin in complex with DNaseI ~ 30 years ago , 14 extensive studies have advanced our understanding of the structure of monomeric and filamentous actin , 15 polymerization mechanisms , posttranslational modifications ( PTMs ) , interaction with drugs , myosin 16 motors , and ABPs at ever - increasing resolution ( 14 , 16 - 31 ) . Despite these important advances , isoform - 17 specific mechanisms with myosin motors and ABPs that drive cellular functions and biochemistries are 18 widely documented but poorly understood . 19 20 To address how the structure contributes to the functional distinction of actin isoforms , we employed 21 recombinant and native protein production approaches to obtain pure , single - isotype preparations of 22 individual isoforms to perform cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) analyses . The 2 . 99 - 3 . 38 Å - resolution 23 structures of filamentous actin isoforms with their native PTMs confirmed the overall design principles , 24 and revealed similarities as well as differences between them . We show that the defining feature used to 25 regulate the interaction with binding proteins is the divergent N - terminus that shows isoform - specific 26 conformations that result in distinct binding regions for myosin motors and ABPs . By comparing bare 27 with previous myosin - bound actin structures , we found that once the actin - myosin interface is formed , the 28 N - terminus is shifted closer to the filament surface , thereby establishing isoform - specific binding 29 interfaces . Next , we employed comparative structural analysis to dissect whether the binding of myosin 30 motors alters actin filament structure in an isoform - dependent manner . We found that myosin motors 31 3 induce subtle conformational changes in the actin filament with pronounced changes in the N - terminus 1 and DNaseI loop ( D - loop ) that are likely to contribute to different biochemical properties and distinct 2 actin landscapes in the cell . Lastly , our high - resolution structures of native actin isoforms allowed us to 3 precisely map PTMs and human disease - causing mutations to establish connections between genetic 4 variation and protein function . Together , our work will inform biochemical and cell biological discoveries 5 of isoform - specific actin regulation mechanisms . 6 7 Results 8 9 High - resolution structures and general principles of actin isoforms 10 To determine the structural characteristics and differences between actin isoforms , we solved the high - 11 resolution structures of single - isotype skeletal a - actin ( 3 . 37 Å ) , cardiac a - actin ( 3 . 07 Å ) , ß - actin ( 2 . 99 Å ) , 12 and g - actin ( 3 . 38 Å ) in the filamentous state using cryo - EM ( Figure 1A - D , Figure 1 - figure supplement 13 1 , Table 1 ) . The structures show local resolutions ranging from 2 . 1 - 3 . 5 Å for skeletal a - actin , 1 . 9 - 3 . 3 Å 14 for cardiac a - actin , 1 . 7 - 3 . 0 Å for ß - actin , and 2 . 1 - 4 . 4 Å for g - actin ( Figure 1 - figure supplement 2 ) . For 15 all actin isoforms , the highest local resolutions were obtained in the central core region . Lower local 16 resolutions were obtained in the most surface exposed and flexible regions such as the N - terminus and the 17 D - loop as expected . All actin structures were solved in the Mg 2 + ·ADP state ( Figure 1E , Figure 2 ) and have 18 been obtained without the use of stabilizing drugs that may interfere with the filament structure ( 6 , 32 , 19 33 ) . 20 Our cryo - EM maps allowed us to build unambiguous models of actin isoforms in which secondary 21 structure information including the side chains , the nucleotide and associated cation ( Mg 2 + ·ADP ) , and 22 PTMs were apparent from the densities ( Figure 1E , Figure 1 - figure supplement 2 ) . This allowed us to 23 resolve the N - terminus of actin isoforms that is often disordered or missing in prior structures ( 34 ) . For ß - 24 actin and g - actin , we could resolve the entire N - terminus starting from amino acids D1 and E1 , 25 respectively . For skeletal a - and cardiac a - actin , we could resolve the N - terminus starting from amino 26 acids E4 and D2 , respectively . The first three amino acids present in mature skeletal muscle actin are 27 unresolved , likely due to their enhanced flexibility in the absence of myosin motors and ABPs ( Figure 28 1B ) . The superposition of all actin isoform structures shows a root - mean - square deviation ( RMSD ) 29 between 0 . 83 Å to 1 . 04 Å , indicating an overall similar topology . 30 31 4 Figure 1 : Cryo - EM filament structures of actin isoforms .

Conserved amino acids as shown in black , variable amino acids are highlighted in blue . Amino acids that are absent in mature actin isoforms are shown in grey . Key structural regions and PTMs visible in our cryo - EM structures are indicated . 6 Consistent with the high sequence conservation across actin isoforms ( Figure 1 - figure supplement 1B - 1 C ) , our reconstructions show the characteristic double - stranded actin helix ( Figure 1A - D , Figure 1 - figure 2 supplement 1A ) that has been observed in numerous previous structural studies , including high - resolution 3 cryo - EM studies ( 16 , 19 , 25 , 29 - 31 , 35 , 36 ) . The actin filament itself is composed of G - actin ( 42 kDa ) 4 protomers that are oriented in the same direction ( 16 ) . Each protomer folds into four subdomains that are 5 referred to as SD1 - SD4 ( Figure 1 , Figure 1 - figure supplement 1A ) ( 17 ) . SD1 and SD2 form the outer 6 domain , SD3 and SD4 form the inner domain ( Figure 1 ) . This domain arrangement results in the 7 formation of two clefts – the inner cleft and the outer cleft ( 2 , 14 , 37 ) . 8 9 Figure 1 - figure supplement 2 : Image processing summary for actin isoforms . ( A - D ) 2D classes , global map - model FSC curves , and the local resolution estimated of the experimental maps are shown for skeletal a - actin ( A ) , cardiac a - actin ( B ) , b - actin ( C ) , and g - actin ( D ) . The gold standard , FSC 0 . 143 criterion was used to estimate the global resolution of actin isoforms . The local resolution gradient is in Angstrom . 7 The inner cleft between SD2 and SD4 is part of the nucleotide - binding site which is occupied by 1 Mg 2 + ·ADP in our structures ( Figure 1E , Figure 2A - D , Figure 1 - figure supplement 1A ) . The outer cleft 2 between SD1 and SD3 represents a major binding interface for myosins and ABPs ( 18 ) . It further mediates 3 longitudinal interfaces within the actin filament . SD1 and SD2 of an actin protomer are at the pointed end , 4 SD3 and SD4 are at the barbed end ( Figure 1 - figure supplement 1A ) ( 2 , 14 , 37 ) . The longitudinal 5 interface between two adjacent actin protomers involves the extended D - loop located in SD2 of one actin 6 protomer that interacts with amino acids located in SD1 and SD3 of another protomer . Both , the N - and 7 C - terminus of the actin protomer are in SD1 ( Figure 1 - figure supplement 1A ) ( 2 , 14 , 37 ) . 8 9 Similarities and differences between actin isoforms 10 Actin isoforms differ by conservative and nonconservative substitutions ( Figure 1 - figure supplement 1C ) 11 that contribute to their distinct biochemical and in vivo function ( 1 , 11 , 12 ) . Overall , the amino acid 12 sequence divergence is higher between muscle and nonmuscle actins than within muscle or nonmuscle 13 actin sequences ( Figure 1 - figure supplement 1C ) .

Actin isoforms show the largest divergence at the acidic N - terminus within 2 SD1 ( Figure 1E , Figure 1 - figure supplement 1C , Figure 3A ) where four conservative substitutions allow 3 for functional interactions with myosins and numerous ABPs ( Figure 1 - figure supplement 1C ) . Of note , 4 amino acids 1 - 3 in our structure of skeletal a - actin and the first amino acid in cardiac a - actin are not 5 resolved and therefore not shown in Figure 3 . Other substitutions are within SD1 ( Figure 3B , Figure 3 - 6 figure supplement 1 ) , SD3 ( Figure 3C , Figure 3 - figure supplement 1 ) , and SD4 ( Figure 3D , Figure 3 - 7 figure supplement 1 ) . There are no substitutions in SD2 , the smallest and most flexible subdomain ( 34 ) . 8 No significant changes in lateral and longitudinal interfaces and the pitch of the actin helix were observed 9 between actin isoforms , emphasizing their overall conserved filamentous structure in the absence of 10 myosin motors or ABPs ( Figure 3 - figure supplement 1 ) . 11 Amino acid substitutions at subdomain interfaces , such as the nucleotide - binding site of actin isoforms , 12 are likely to influence protein function . To evaluate their possible impact on nucleotide coordination and 13 the structural organization of the binding site , we performed a comparative structural analysis . Our cryo - 14 EM reconstructions show that the nucleotide - binding site in the inner cleft is highly conserved between 15 actin isoforms ( Figure 1E , Figure 2 ) . The densities for Mg 2 + and ADP were assigned without ambiguity 16 and revealed strong interactions with amino acids located in SD2 ( Q59 , Y69 ) and SD4 ( E207 , R210 , K213 , 17 E214 ) but also with amino acids located in SD1 ( L16 / M15 , K18 , Q137 , Y337 ) and SD3 ( D157 , M305 , 18 Y306 , K336 ) ( Figure 2 ) . While most of the interactions are polar and electrostatic , amino acid Y306 19 forms p - p interactions with the adenine ring of ADP . Amino acids L16 / M15 and M305 / M304 form 20 hydrophobic interactions in the active site ( Figure 2 ) . The positions of the nucleotide and Mg 2 + are 21 virtually identical in all structures , suggesting that the substitution of amino acid L16 in muscle actins 22 with M15 in nonmuscle actins does not alter the overall topology of the nucleotide - binding site . Instead , 23 the larger side chain of M16 , located in a loop that protrudes into the cleft , acts as an extended lid that 24 flanks the active site and shields the phosphate groups of ADP ( Figure 2 ) . Near the nucleotide - binding 25 site , amino acids C10 and V17 in muscle actins are substituted with V9 and C16 in nonmuscle actins 26 ( Figure 3 , Figure 1 - figure supplement 1C ) . These substitutions are conservative in that they maintain the 27 overall oxidation - reduction environment within filamentous actin which is important for its dynamic 28 properties and the interaction with some regulatory proteins ( 38 - 41 ) . 29 30 31 9 PTMs are not only essential for actin structure , function , and dynamics but also for their interaction with 1 myosin motors and APBs ( 42 - 44 ) . PTMs have been identified on > 90 out of the 375 amino acids of actin 2 isoforms ( 44 ) . Widely documented and critical PTMs of mature actins include the posttranslational 3 acetylation of the N - terminus ( ~ 100 % ) by N - terminal acetyltransferase NAA80 and methylation of H73 4 by SET domain protein 3 ( SETD3 ) ( 43 , 45 ) . We could resolve the entire N - terminus including the Nt - 5 acetylated D1 ( D1 AC ) in b - actin and the Nt - acetylated E1 ( E1 AC ) in g - actin . To our knowledge , these are 6 the first reported structures of filamentous nonmuscle actins in which the acetylated N - terminus has been 7 8 Figure 3 : Similarities and differences between actin isoforms .

Note that the first 3 amino acids of skeletal a - actin and the first amino acid of cardiac a - actin are unresolved in our structures . 10 Figure 3 - figure supplement 1 : Variable amino acid distributions along the actin helical pitches .

The acetylation site is exposed on the filament surface and adds an additional negative charge 2 to the already negatively charged N - terminus ( Figure 1 - figure supplement 1C ) . Further , we could resolve 3 the methylated H73 ( H73 me ) that contributes to the overall stability of actin isoforms in all cryo - EM 4 reconstructions ( 46 , 47 ) . The presence of both key PTMs in our cryo - EM reconstructions emphasizes that 5 our recombinant human actins represent bona fide posttranslationally processed forms of mature 6 nonmuscle actins ( Figure 1B ) ( 48 ) . 7 8 Myosin modulates actin filament structure 9 Myosin motors bind actin in a nucleotide - dependent , reversible manner to generate force and motion ( 49 , 10 50 ) . The myosin enzymatic cycle can be categorized into states with weak ( ATP , ADP·Pi ) and strong 11 ( ADP , nucleotide - free ( apo ) ) actin affinity ( 51 , 52 ) . In the strong affinity states , a binding interface is 12 established between actin and the myosin motor domain ( 18 , 53 , 54 ) . To determine whether myosin 13 binding to actin modulates actin filament structure , we compared the structures of filamentous bare actin 14 isoforms with previous high - resolution cryo - EM structures of myosin - bound actins . First , we compared 15 the structure of apo nonmuscle myosin - 2C ( NM2C , PDB ID : 5JLH ) bound to g - actin , the structure of apo 16 myosin - 1B bound to a - skeletal actin ( M1B , PDB ID : 6C1H ) , and the structure of Mg 2 + ·ADP . M1B bound 17 to a - skeletal actin ( PDB ID : 6C1G ) with our structures of bare actin isoforms . The actomyosin structures 18 were selected since they represent distinct high - affinity binding states ( Mg 2 + ·ADP versus apo ) and classes 19 of myosin motors with different enzymatic output ( 24 , 52 , 55 ) . We found that the binding of myosin to 20 SD3 SD1 SD4 Overlap A B C D 11 actin causes subtle conformational changes in the actin filament ( Figure 4 ) . Superimposition of the actin 1 structures revealed that the C - a s of bare and myosin - bound actin protomers deviate with an RMSD of 2 ~ 1 . 15Å . Notably , these changes are similar for myosins from different classes and independent of the 3 nucleotide state of the respective motor domain ( Figure 4 ) . 4 Figure 4 : The actomyosin interface . ( A ) Superimposition of bare actin isoform structures in the Mg 2 + ·ADP state ( left ) , superimposition of myosin - bound actin isoforms structures ( middle ) , and overlap of bare vs myosin - bound actin structures ( right ) are shown . ( B ) Zoomed - in view of the actomyosin interface at the D - loop region . For clarity , only D - loops involved in the binding of myosins are highlighted in the respective dark colors . 12 The binding interface between actin and myosin is dynamic . It spans across two adjacent actin protomers 1 along the long - pitch helix of actin and involves SD1 and SD2 of one protomer and the D - loop of another 2 ( 18 , 24 ) . Structural comparison of bare and myosin - bound actins showed that the actin D - loop adopts 3 distinct conformations with an RMSD of ~ 0 . 95 - 1 . 25Å ( Figure 4A and B ) . A direct comparison of bare g - 4 actin with g - actin / NM2C complex shows the subtle inward movement of the D - loop with an RMSD of 5 ~ 1 . 25Å in the myosin - bound state . This suggests that myosin - binding induces subtle changes in the outer 6 actin cleft that represents a part of the actomyosin interface . Further , the analysis of the actomyosin 7 interface shows that the D - loop conformation does not change significantly with respect to the nucleotide 8 states ( apo versus ADP ) of myosin ( Figure 5B ) . 9 10 Next , we analyzed the position of the exposed actin N - terminus and the effect of Nt - acetylation of 11 nonmuscle actins on the interaction with myosin motors . The structure of NM2C bound to g - actin ( PDB 12 ID : 5JLH ) was selected because structural elements involved in actin binding are partially resolved . The 13 superimposition of bare and myosin - bound actin structures shows that the N - termini of skeletal a - actin 14 points in a different direction compared to those from ß - actin and g - actin ( Figure 5B ) . We also observed 15 that the actin N - terminus is positioned closer to the filament surface in myosin - bound structures compared 16 to bare actin structures . The negatively charged N - termini of bare ß - actin and g - actin are near loop - 2 , a 17 major element of the actomyosin interface that is rich in positively charged amino acids and variable in 18 length ( 55 - 58 ) . This interface is likely to represent one of the initial contact sites upon the formation of a 19 transient intermediate between both proteins during complex formation . Nt - acetylation of actin likely 20 enhances long - range electrostatic interactions between both proteins that subsequently trigger allosteric 21 structural changes that result in the formation of the actomyosin interface . Specifically , a cluster of 22 positively charged amino acids ( R661 , R663 , R664 ) in loop - 2 of NM2C may interact with either the 23 acetylated N - terminus of ß - actin ( D1 AC , D2 , D3 ) or the acetylated N - terminus of g - actin ( E1 AC , E2 , E3 ) 24 ( Figure 5B - C ) to stabilize the interface . Our structural analysis also revealed that a shorter loop - 2 , as it is 25 found for example in M1B , might be less efficient in stabilizing the actin N - terminus ( Figure 5 ) . This 26 suggests that distinct actin - myosin interfaces are formed between actin isoforms and myosin motor 27 proteins that may determine the strength of the interaction and biochemical outputs . 28 29 13 1 Amino acid substitutions overlap with the location of mutations and PTMs in actin isoforms 2 The defining feature of actin isoforms are amino acid substitutions in SD1 , SD3 , and SD4 ( Figure 3 , 3 Figure 1 - figure supplement 1C ) . Further diversification of actin isoform is achieved by isoform - specific 4 Figure 5 : The N - terminus of actin interacts with loop - 2 of myosins . ( A ) Close - up view of the N - termini of bare b - actin ( blue ) and bare g - actin ( red ) and myosin - bound actin isoforms . ( B ) A cluster of positively charged amino acids in the loop - 2 of myosins are in close proximity to amino acids D1 Ac to D3 in the N - terminus of bare b - actin ( blue ) and , ( C ) a cluster of positively charged amino acids in the loop - 2 of myosins are in close proximity to amino acids E1 Ac to E3 in the N - terminus of bare g - actin ( red ) . 14 and - redundant PTM mechanisms that contribute to their biochemical and physiological signatures ( Table 1 2 ) . Mutations in genes encoding for actin isoforms have been linked to debilitating diseases including 2 disorders of the muscle and vasculature and cancers ( 59 - 62 ) . Abnormal PTM patterns are also often linked 3 to disease and can , among other factors , occur in response to mutations of amino acids that would harbor 4 a PTM under physiological conditions . To identify a possible relationship between the location of 5 mutations and PTMs , we systematically analyzed the location of disease - causing mutations ( Table 3 ) and 6 PTMs ( Table 2 ) in the structures of actin isoforms . First , we mapped select mutations for each actin 7 isoform using our cryo - EM structures . We observed that most mutations are localized in either SD1 , SD3 , 8 or SD4 . Relatively few mutations are localized in SD2 ( Figure 6 ) , the most conserved subdomain . By 9 comparing the location of mutations between actin isoforms , we found that more mutations are present at 10 the interface along the short - pitch helix , especially in SD3 , in muscle actins compared to nonmuscle actins 11 ( Figure 6 , Figure 3 - figure supplement 1 ) . PTMs have been reported on ~ 25 % of the amino acids in actin 12 isoforms with phosphorylation being the most abundant modification ( Table 2 ) . By comparing the number 13 of reported phosphorylation sites , we found that sites in nonmuscle actins are more often modified than 14 sites in muscle actins . In some instances , phosphorylation is abolished by amino acid substitutions 15 between actin isoforms . For instance , the phosphorylatable T161 and T200 in nonmuscle actins are 16 substituted with non - phosphorylatable amino acids in muscle actins ( Table 2 ) . Similarly , the substitution 17 of C271 in nonmuscle actins with A272 in muscle actins changes the oxidation - reduction environment 18 between actin isoforms ( Table 2 ) . This suggests that an isoform - specific ‘PTM code’ exists that is likely 19 to change in time and space as cellular conditions demand . By mapping the precise location of PTMs , we 20 found that isoforms undergo extensive post - translational modifications throughout the molecule except 21 for the regions corresponding to amino acids 125 – 145 , 240 – 256 , and 331 – 354 , which have an overall 22 lower PTM burden ( Table 2 ) . This region includes the pathogenic helix ( K112 - T126 ) that mediates the 23 interaction between two actin protomers ( 44 ) . Only two amino acids ( K112 / K113 and K117 / K118 ) have 24 been described to be posttranslationally modified while this region is known as a mutational hotspot in 25 actin isoforms ( Figure 6 and Table 3 ) . As structural changes in the pathogenic helix and structural 26 elements that interact with it can affect filament biochemistry , dynamics , and interactions with binding 27 proteins , altered PTM patterns and / or mutations in this region could underlie one of the molecular 28 mechanisms that lead to disease ( 44 , 63 , 64 ) . 29 30 15 Figure 6 : Location of selected mutations in actin isoform structures . ( A ) Select mutations ( n > 4 ) in skeletal a - actin are mapped onto the a - actin structure . ( B ) Select mutations ( n > 4 ) in cardiac a - actin are mapped onto the cardiac a - actin structure . ( C ) Select mutations ( n > 2 ) in cytoplasmic b - actin are mapped onto the acetylated b - actin structure and ( D ) Select mutations ( n > 4 ) in cytoplasmic g - actin are mapped onto the acetylated g - actin structure . ‘n’ indicates the number of studies that showed mutations of the indicated amino acids . 1 Discussion 2 3 Despite many elegant , high - resolution cryo - EM studies of filamentous actin in the absence and presence 4 of myosin motors and ABPs , our understanding of the structural mechanisms that underlie the nuanced 5 interactions of actin isoforms with interacting proteins remain largely elusive . This knowledge however 6 is critical to understanding how protein binding modulates actin filament structure that in turn may be 7 recognized by and guide other interacting proteins or partners ( 9 , 10 , 25 ) . That way , specialized actin 8 networks with distinct structures and compositions can form and a variety of actin landscapes can be 9 created ( 9 , 10 , 65 - 68 ) . 10 11 To further our understanding of the sequence - structure relationship of actin isoforms , we solved four high - 12 resolution cryo - EM structures including the structure of bare and homogeneous filamentous skeletal a - 13 actin and the previously unknown structures of cardiac a - actin , ß - actin , and g - actin . This allowed us to 14 reveal the similarities and differences between actin isoforms , their distinct modes of interactions with 15 myosin motors , as well as the analysis of the complex interplay between disease - causing mutations and 16 the ‘PTM code’ . Our study showed that the overall structure of actin isoforms is conserved , as expected 17 from the high sequence conservation . However , each of these structures shows subtle differences . Minor 18 changes were observed near the nucleotide - binding cleft ( Figure 2 ) that may contribute to the reported 19 changes in the biochemistries of actin isoforms ( 69 , 70 ) . The most prominent structural change between 20 16 actin isoforms corresponds to the N - terminus location ( Figure 1 , Figure 5 ) . Given that the sequence of 1 actin isoforms differs the most at the N - terminus ( Figure 1E , Figure 1 - figure supplement 1C ) and the 2 central role of the N - terminus in interactions with myosin motors and ABPs , we propose that these 3 topological changes may drive different biochemical interactions . For example , by comparing the 4 structures of a - skeletal actin with the g - actin / NM2C complex , a previous study suggested a pulling 5 mechanism in which the actin N - terminus is pulled towards the actomyosin interface in the rigor state 6 ( 18 ) . Based on our structures that show different conformations of the N - terminus , we suggest that instead 7 of a large conformational change through a pulling mechanism , actin isoform - specific interfaces with 8 myosin motors are formed that involve a more subtle movement of the N - terminus due to retropropagated 9 structural changes . These interfaces likely contribute to the extent actin isoforms can activate the myosin 10 ATPase activity and support motility in vitro and establish different actin landscapes in cells ( 7 , 10 ) . 11 Importantly , these actin isoform - specific interfaces may be further diversified by differential N - terminal 12 processing of actin isoforms , PTMs , and alternatively spliced myosin motors ( 7 , 15 , 41 , 44 , 55 , 71 , 72 ) . 13 For example , the Nt - acetylated N - termini of actin isoforms would likely be more efficient to establish 14 electrostatic interactions with the positively charged loop - 2 of myosin while the addition of a positive 15 charge to the N - terminus of actin isoforms through arginylation may weaken the interaction . While we 16 focused our structural analysis on the interaction between actin isoforms with myosin motors , the actin N - 17 terminus can interact with numerous ABPs ( 15 ) . Therefore , we predict that the proposed isoform - specific 18 interaction mechanisms extend to ABPs . Together , we present direct structural evidence that the binding 19 of myosin motors modulates actin filament structure and propose a possible mechanism for the formation 20 of actin isoform - specific interactions with binding proteins by the conformation of its N - terminus ( Figure 21 5 ) . 22 Actin isoforms are subject to extensive PTM mechanisms that may drive structural changes , distinct 23 biochemistries , and cellular activities ( 3 , 12 , 41 ) . Prevalent PTMs of actin isoforms include acetylation , 24 phosphorylation , and methylation ( Table 2 ) . The high resolution of our structures allowed us to resolve 25 the Nt - acetylated N - termini in filamentous ß - actin and g - actin , to our knowledge , for the first time . Further , 26 we could resolve the methylated H73 / H72 in all our structures . By mapping the known locations of PTMs 27 ( Table 2 ) and disease - causing mutations ( Table 3 ) on our structures of actin isoforms , we revealed that 28 some sites of modification overlap with sites of mutation ( Table 2 , Table 3 , Figure 6 ) . This suggests that 29 some mutations may not only change the structure and biochemistry of actin isoforms but may elicit 30 complex combinatorial effects by abolishing native posttranslational modification patterns or by 31 17 potentially promoting aberrant posttranslational modifications . For instance , T88 in β - and γ - actins are 1 part of the binding interfaces with cofilin and gelsolin 3 and can be phosphorylated under normal 2 conditions ( 44 ) . Mutation of amino acid T88 to I88 in γ - actin not only prevents phosphorylation but has 3 also been linked to age - related hearing loss ( 73 ) . Another example is amino acid K212 that interacts with 4 nucleotides in the active site ( Figure 2 ) and is known to be acetylated and ubiquitinated in β - and γ - actins 5 while mutation K212R has been linked to hearing loss ( 74 ) . Further , our analysis revealed that in addition 6 to the absence of amino acid substitutions in SD2 , its mutation burden is also reduced ( Figure 1 - figure 7 supplement 2 ) . However , PTMs are present in SD2 of actin isoforms , suggesting that major structural 8 alterations induced by amino acid substitutions and / or mutations in the highly conserved D - loop are likely 9 to interfere with its critical role in filament biochemistry and the interactions with ABPs and myosin 10 motors . In summary , our work suggests that in some instances , mutational changes may alter or re - write 11 the ‘PTM code’ of actin isoforms that may further modulate the possible effect of the mutation on protein 12 function . 13 14 In conclusion , we present direct evidence for the structural divergence of actin isoforms that underlies 15 their nuanced interactions with myosin motors and ABPs . Our work serves as a strong foundation for our 16 understanding of the sequence - function relationship of actin isoforms . By adding our cryo - EM structures 17 to the collection of previous structures of the bare and decorated actin filaments , we provide a 18 comprehensive understanding of the remarkable diversity of actin isoforms that is reflected in their 19 biological activities in health and disease . 20 21 Material and Methods 22 23 Protein production and purification 24 Native actins : Rabbit skeletal muscle a - actin ( UniProt ID : P68135 ) was prepared from acetone powder 25 ( Pel - Freez Biologicals , Rogers , AR ) as described earlier ( 75 ) . Cardiac a - actin ( UniProt ID : Q3ZC07 ) was 26 prepared from the left ventricle of a bovine heart ( local butcher ) as described for a - skeletal muscle actin . 27 At the amino acid level , both proteins are identical to the respective human proteins . 28 29 Recombinant actins : P . pastoris transformants for human β - actin ( UniProt ID : P60709 ) and human g - actin 30 ( UniProt ID : P63261 ) were stored at - 80˚C and were revived on YPD solid media plates at 30˚C . Cells 31 18 were inoculated into 200 ml MGY liquid media composed of 1 . 34 % yeast nitrogen base without amino 1 acids ( Millipore Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) , 0 . 4 mg / L biotin , and 1 % glycerol and cultured at 30˚C , 220 rpm . 2 The culture medium was diluted to 6 L with fresh MGY media and cells were further cultured at 30˚C , 3 220 rpm in six 2 L flasks until the optical density at 600 nm ( OD600 ) reached around 1 . 5 . Cells were 4 pelleted down by centrifugation ( 10628 g at 25˚C for 5 min , F9 - 6 x 1000 LEX rotor , Thermo Fisher 5 Scientific , Waltham , MA ) . The cells were washed once with sterilized water and re - suspended into 6 L 6 MM composed of 1 . 34 % yeast nitrogen base without amino acids ( SIGMA Y0626 ) , 0 . 4 mg / L biotin and 7 0 . 5 % methanol . Cells were cultured in twelve 2 L baffled flasks ( 500 mL for each ) at 30˚C , 220 rpm for 8 1 . 5 - 2 days . 0 . 5 % methanol was fed every 24 hours during the culture . Cells were pelleted down by 9 centrifugation ( 10628 g at 25˚C for 5 min , F9 - 6 x 1000 LEX rotor , Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , 10 MA ) . Cells were washed once with water and suspended in 75 mL of ice - cold water . The suspension was 11 dripped into a liquid nitrogen bath and stored at - 80˚C . 50 g cell suspension was loaded into a grinder tube 12 SPEX® SamplePrep , Metuchen , NJ ) pre - cooled with liquid nitrogen . Cells were grinded in a liquid 13 nitrogen bath of a Freezer mill ( SPEX® SamplePrep , Metuchen , NJ ) . The duration of the grinding was 1 14 min with 14 cycle per second ( cps ) . The grinding procedure was repeated 30 times at 1 min intervals . 15 Liquid nitrogen was re - filled every 10 times of the grinding . The resulting powder was kept on dry ice 16 until the next step . The powder was kept at room temperature until it started to melt . Then it was resolved 17 in equal amount of 2 x binding buffer composed of 20mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 20mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 18 0 . 6M NaCl , 4mM MgCl 2 , 2mM ATP ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 2x concentration of protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche 19 cOmplete , EDTA free , Millipore Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) , 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) 20 and 7mM beta - mercaptoethanol . The lysate was sonicated on ice ( 3 minutes , 5 seconds pulse , 10 seconds 21 pause with 60 % amplitude , QSONICA SONICATORS , Newtown , CT ) until all aggregates were resolved . 22 The lysate was centrifuged at 4˚C ( 3220 g for 5 min , A - 4 - 81 rotor , Eppendorf , Enfield , CT ) to remove 23 intact cells and debris . The insoluble fraction was removed by high - speed centrifugation at 4˚C ( 25658 g 24 for 30 minutes , A23 - 6 x 100 rotor , ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) . The supernatant was 25 filtrated with a Filtropur BT50 0 . 2 µm bottle top filter ( SARSTEDT , Nümbrecht , Germany ) and incubated 26 with 6 ml Nickel resin ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) at 4˚C for 1 hour . The resin was pelleted 27 down by centrifugation at 4˚C ( 1258 g for 5 min , A - 4 - 81 rotor , Eppendorf , Enfield , CT ) and washed with 28 ice - cold 50 mL Binding buffer composed of 10mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 10mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 300mM 29 NaCl , 2mM MgCl 2 , 1mM ATP ( pH 7 . 0 ) and 7mM beta - mercaptoethanol for 4 times . The resin was 30 washed 5 times with G - buffer composed of 5mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 0 . 2mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 01 w / v % NaN 3 , 31 19 0 . 2mM ATP ( pH 7 . 0 ) and 0 . 5mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) . The resin was suspended in an ice - cold 40 mL G - 1 buffer with 5 µg / ml TLCK treated chymotrypsin ( Millipore Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) and incubated 2 overnight at 4˚C . The chymotrypsin was inactivated by 1 mM PMSF and the elution was collected into a 3 tube . Actin retained on the resin was eluted with 12 mL G - buffer without actin and all elution fractions 4 were combined and concentrated with a 30 kDa cut - off membrane ( Millipore Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) to 5 0 . 9 ml . The 0 . 9 ml of each actin was polymerized by adding 100 µl of 10x MKE solution composed of 6 20mM MgCl 2 , 50mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid ( EGTA ) , and 1M KCl for 1 hour at room 7 temperature . The polymerized actin samples were pelleted down by ultracentrifugation at room 8 temperature ( 45000 rpm for 1 hour , TLA - 55 rotor , Beckman Coulter , Indianapolis , IN ) . The pellets were 9 rinsed once with a 1 mL G - buffer and re - suspended into ice - cold 0 . 5 mL G - buffer . The actin was 10 depolymerized by dialysis against a 1 L G - buffer at 4˚C for 2 days . The dialysis buffer was exchanged 11 every 12 hours . The solutions with the depolymerized actin were collected into 1 . 5 ml centrifuge tubes 12 and stored on ice . 13 14 Sample preparation and Cryo - EM data collection 15 For cryo - EM studies , G - actin was polymerized by the addition of a 10x stock solution of buffer containing 16 0 . 5M KCl , 20mM MgCl 2 , 10mM EDTA , and 0 . 1M MOPS pH 7 . 0 before plunge freezing . Briefly , C - flat 17 1 . 2 / 1 . 3 gold grids were glow - discharged with a PELCO easiGlow ( TedPella , Redding , CA ) for 60s . 4 µL 18 of actin sample was applied to the grids , incubated for 1 minute , and blotted for 4s at 95 % humidity . Grids 19 were plunged into liquid ethane using a Leica EM GM2 plunger ( Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) 20 and stored in liquid nitrogen until data collection . All grids were screened for homogeneous sample 21 distribution and optimal ice thickness on a Glacios cryo - TEM ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) 22 equipped with a Falcon 3EC direct electron detector at a magnification of 92 , 000x . Data collection on 23 optimal grids was performed on a Titan Krios G3i ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) operated at 24 300kV , equipped with a K3 direct electron detector , a Bioquantum energy filter , and a Cs image corrector . 25 For skeletal a - actin , a total of 2 , 046 movies with a magnification of 81 , 000x , corresponding to a pixel 26 size of 0 . 4455 Å were collected in super - resolution mode at a defocus range of - 0 . 5 µm to - 2 . 5 µm with a 27 total electron dose of 65 e - / Å 2 per movie . For cardiac a - actin , a total of 1 , 444 movies with a magnification 28 of 81 , 000x , corresponding to a pixel size of 0 . 4455 Å were collected in super - resolution mode at a defocus 29 range of - 0 . 5 µm to - 2 . 5 µm with a total electron dose of 60 e - / Å 2 per movie . For acetylated b - and g - 30 actins , a total of 1 , 352 movies and 2 , 952 movies with a magnification of 81 , 000x , corresponding to a pixel 31 20 size of 0 . 4455 Å were collected in super - resolution mode at a defocus range of - 0 . 5 µm to - 2 . 5 µm with a 1 total electron dose of 50 e - / Å 2 and 65 e - / Å 2 per movie , respectively . Data collection for all actins were 2 performed using EPU software ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) . Data collection statistics are 3 shown in Table 1 . 4 5 Image processing and 3D reconstruction 6 All raw movies of skeletal and cardiac a - actin were aligned , drift corrected , and dose weighted using the 7 Patch motion module and the CTF parameters were estimated using the Patch CTF module implemented 8 in cryoSPARCv3 . 2 ( 76 ) . All raw movies of acetylated b - and g - actin were aligned , and motion - corrected 9 using the Patch motion module in cryoSPARC and MotionCor2 software ( 76 ) , and the CTF parameters 10 were estimated using the Patch CTF module implemented in cryoSPARCv3 . 2 . Segments of actin filaments 11 were initially picked using the template - free tracing method implemented in the filament tracer module in 12 cryoSPARC to generate templates for particle picking ( 76 ) . A small set of particles for reference - free 2D 13 classifications was selected and subsequently used as templates for filament tracing . Further , segments of 14 filaments were extracted and several rounds of 2D classifications were performed to remove erroneous 15 picks and well - aligned 2D classes were selected as templates for ab initio 3D reconstruction . For all actins , 16 a major class with a filamentous model that showed clear helical features was selected for 3D refinements 17 using the helical refinement module implemented in cryoSPARCv3 . 2 ( 76 ) . For acetylated b - and g - actins , 18 final rounds of refinements were performed using the homogenous refinement module in cryoSPARC . 19 Data collection statistics , the image processing and the refinement summary of models are shown in Table 20 1 . 21 22 Model building , refinement , and validation 23 For model building , sharpened maps were used to build models of filamentous actins . We have used a 24 common approach of model building , refinement , and validation for all actin isoforms . Briefly , the high - 25 resolution structures of Mg 2 + × ADP bound skeletal and cardiac a - actins , Nt - acetylated b - and g - actins were 26 built using PDB entry 6DJO as a template . Initial rigid - body docking into the cryo - EM reconstructions of 27 actin maps was performed with Molecular Dynamics Flexible Fitting ( MDFF ) function in Chimera ( 77 ) . 28 Iterative model building was performed using real - space refinement in Phenix ( 78 ) and COOT ( 79 ) . The 29 acetylated N - terminus of the b - and g - actins were manually placed in the cryo - EM densities using COOT . 30 It is important to note that the N - terminal amino acids ( 1 to 3 ) showed high flexibility and we manually 31 21 placed the best possible rotamers using COOT and minimized the rotamers using Phenix . All final actin 1 models were refined using Phenix and the refined models were validated using MolProbity ( 80 ) . Amino 2 acids are numbered according to the sequence of mature actin isoforms ( Figure 1 - figure supplement 1C ) . 3 4 Acknowledgments 5 We thank Dr .
