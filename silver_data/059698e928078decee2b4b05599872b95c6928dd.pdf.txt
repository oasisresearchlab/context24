However , it is still unknown if this ﬁ nding holds true with new variants of concern ( VOC ) , such as Delta ( B . 1 . 617 . 2 ) . This study aimed to examine differences in both viral RNA ( as measured by cycle threshold [ C T ] ) and viable - virus levels from children infected with Delta and those infected with original variants ( OV ) . Furthermore , we aimed to compare the pediatric population infection trends to those in adults . We obtained 690 SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR positive na - sopharyngeal swabs from across Manitoba , Canada , which were further screened for mutations characteristic of VOC . Aliquots of sample were then provided for TCID 50 ( 50 % tissue culture infective dose ) assays to determine infectious titers . Using a vari - ety of statistical analyses we compared C T and infectivity of VOC in different age demographics . Comparing 122 Delta - to 175 OV - positive nasopharyngeal swab sam - ples from children , we found that those infected with Delta are 2 . 7 times more likely to produce viable SARS - CoV - 2 with higher titers ( in TCID 50 per milliliter ) , regardless of viral RNA levels . Moreover , comparing the pediatric samples to 130 OV - and 263 Delta - positive samples from adults , we found only that the Delta pediatric culture - positive samples had titers ( TCID 50 per milliliter ) similar to those of culture - positive adult samples . IMPORTANCE These important ﬁ ndings show that children may play a larger role in viral transmission of Delta than for previously circulating SARS - CoV - 2 variants . Additionally , they may suggest a mechanism for why Delta has evolved to be the predominant circu - lating variant . KEYWORDS COVID - 19 , Delta variant , RT - PCR , SARS - CoV - 2 , TCID 50 S evere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , has caused over 556 million cases and 6 . 3 million deaths globally as of 15 July 2022 ( WHO dashboard ) . It has been previously reported that children of all ages are susceptible to SARS - CoV - 2 infection ; however , unlike for other respiratory viruses , they seem to account for fewer cases and deaths , milder symptoms , and a reduced role in viral transmission relative to adults ( 1 – 7 ) . Nevertheless , with new SARS - CoV - 2 variants of concern ( VOC ) rapidly appearing , it is important to understand and monitor how children contribute to ongoing infection and transmission trends . This is particularly imperative with reduced vaccine eligibility and the return of in - person learning at school and early - care settings , as the proximity Editor Alison Sinclair , University of Sussex Ad Hoc Peer Reviewer AsaadAtaa , Thamar University Copyright © 2022 Garnett et al .

The SARS - CoV - 2 Delta ( B . 1 . 617 . 2 ) variant ﬁ rst appeared with devastating effects in India and was quickly detected around the globe , causing surges in case numbers and subsequently becoming the predominant circulating strain by June 2021 ( 9 ) . Delta was determined to be a VOC by the World Health Organization due to evidence of higher transmissibility , worse clinical implications , and decreased vaccine ef ﬁ cacy ( 10 – 13 ) . Speci ﬁ cally , early data showed that Delta has a 60 % increase in transmissibility in adults over previous VOC , including Alpha ( B . 1 . 1 . 7 ) ( 14 ) . Coinciding with the circulation of Delta , pediatric cases , hospitalizations , and COVID - 19 - related complications and deaths have also increased ( 15 ) . This was evi - dent from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention work reporting up to a 10 - fold increase in COVID - 19 - associated hospitalization rates ( 16 ) . However , no studies speci ﬁ cally evaluating the infectivity of children infected with Delta have been com - pleted . Therefore , the aim of this study was to investigate if there are any signi ﬁ cant differences in cycle threshold ( C T ) values or levels of viable infectious virus obtained from swab samples from children and adults infected with Delta and compare these rates to those of previously circulating original variants ( OV ) . RESULTS A total of 130 OV - and 263 Delta - positive samples from adults were compared to 175 OV - and 122 Delta - positive samples from children . In children , there was no difference in median cycle threshold ( C T ) between OV and Delta samples ( 24 [ 18 to 30 ] versus 23 [ 20 to 28 ] ; P = 0 . 97 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . However , the odds of cell culture positivity were signi ﬁ cantly higher for pediatric Delta samples than for OV samples ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 2 . 7 ; 95 % con ﬁ - dence interval [ CI ] , 1 . 6 to 4 . 5 ; P , 0 . 001 ) . We found viable virus in 41 . 0 % ( 95 % CI , 32 . 1 to 50 . 2 % ) of Delta samples compared to 20 . 5 % ( 95 % CI , 14 . 8 to 27 . 3 % ) of OV samples . In samples that were culture positive , the quantity of viable virus , measured as 50 % tissue culture infective doses ( TCID 50 ) per milliliter , was also signi ﬁ cantly higher for Delta than for OV ( 5 . 62E 1 03 TCID 50 / mL [ 5 . 62E 1 2 to 1 . 78E 1 04 ] versus 5 . 62E 1 02 TCID 50 / mL [ 3 . 16E 1 02 to 3 . 16E 1 03 ] ; P , 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . When the pediatric samples were compared to the adult samples , children had a signi ﬁ cantly higher mean C T , denoting less viral RNA , for the Delta VOC ( 23 . 3 [ 19 . 8 to 27 . 6 ] versus 20 . 9 [ 18 . 0 to 24 . 1 ] ; P , 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Children also had a 0 . 55 - lower odds ratio of a positive culture ( 95 % CI , 0 . 36 to 0 . 85 ; P = 0 . 008 ) than adults . However , pediat - ric Delta samples that were culture positive resulted in similar TCID 50 / mL titers com - pared to adult samples ( 5 . 62E 1 03 [ 5 . 62E 1 02 to 1 . 78E 1 04 ] versus 5 . 62E 1 03 [ 5 . 62E 1 02 to 3 . 16E 1 04 ] , P = 0 . 62 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . C T values for the beta globin ( BGB ) gene showed no statistical difference between samples by age ( Fig . 3 ) , thereby signifying that the quality of the samples was compara - ble between age groups . This also con ﬁ rms that there were no differential PCR inhibitors FIG 1 Comparison of SARS - CoV - 2 E gene RT - PCR C T value by VOC versus age group . Median C T values were higher for the Delta variant in pediatric age groups than in adults ( P , 0 . 001 ; Kruskal - Wallis ANOVA ) , implying lower viral RNA levels . Median [ IQR ] C T was similar for children 0 to 17 years old between OV and Delta variant ( 24 [ 18 to 30 ] versus 23 [ 20 to 28 ] ; P = 0 . 97 ) .

DISCUSSION Interpretation . Within the pediatric population , we found that individuals infected with Delta are 2 . 7 times more likely to produce viable SARS - CoV - 2 , and at higher titers , than age - matched individuals infected with OV . This important ﬁ nding shows that chil - dren may play a larger role in viral transmission of Delta than previously circulating SARS - CoV - 2 variants . Children and youth contributing to increased viral transmission of Delta may help explain one mechanism of how Delta became the predominant circulat - ing variant ( 9 ) . However , in agreeance with our previous study , children infected with Delta still have 45 % lower odds of having a culture - positive sample than adults ( 17 ) . Children have borne a signi ﬁ cant burden from disruptions in developmental , social , and educational activities from the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic , while their role in the spread of disease has been continuously scrutinized . Although earlier studies suggested that the spread of disease from and among children is low , more recent evidence suggests that this may be changing ( 15 , 18 ) . As highly transmissible VOC , such as Delta , arise glob - ally , there is a renewed concern regarding the pediatric population ’ s role in seeding out - breaks and an increasing importance to understanding the infection dynamics in this population ( 2 , 19 ) . In the absence of epidemiological evidence of the spread of the vari - ous variants of SARS - CoV - 2 among and from children , we investigated differences in both C T and viable virus levels in children infected with Delta compared to OV . We then further compared the pediatric population infection trends to the adult population . The physiological mechanism of age discrepancies for SARS - CoV - 2 infection is still widely under investigation due to the potentially large number of biological , host , and environmental factors ( 20 ) . These factors may include differences in the dynamics of shedding from children compared to adults and / or re ﬂ ect differences in maturity of their respective immune systems ( 21 ) . FIG 2 Comparison of TCID 50 per milliliter by VOC versus age group . There was no difference in numbers of TCID 50 per milliliter between the different age categories with respect to the Delta variant speci ﬁ cally ( P = 0 . 68 ; Kruskal - Wallis ANOVA ) . In the pediatric age groups , the TCID 50 / mL value was signi ﬁ cantly higher for the Delta variant in the 11 - to 17 - year age category than for OV ( 5 , 620 [ 1 , 780 to 17 , 800 ] versus 316 [ 178 to 2 , 125 ] ; P , 0 . 001 ) , but there was no difference in the 0 - to 10 - year age category . FIG 3 Linear regression analysis of swab beta globin ( BGB ) gene C T versus age shows no statistical difference between BGB C T level and age at which the sample was obtained . SARS - CoV - 2 Delta Infectivity in Children versus Adults Microbiology Spectrum September / October 2022 Volume 10 Issue 5 10 . 1128 / spectrum . 00395 - 22 3 While it has been generally accepted that higher secondary attack rates are associ - ated with higher viral loads , as measured by quantitative nucleic acid ampli ﬁ cation methods ( i . e . , real - time PCR [ RT - PCR ] ) , others have shown that nucleic acid detection does not necessarily coincide with the presence of infectious virus ( 17 , 22 ) . The latter point is apparent in the results shown here , where C T levels were similar in children infected with Delta and OV ; however , Delta - positive samples produced much higher culture positivity than previous variants . Here , culture positivity was evaluated using TCID 50 / mL titers on cells as a surrogate for transmissibility , a much more speci ﬁ c test of infectivity than RT - PCR . This difference between Delta and OV culture positivity in chil - dren may reveal one aspect of its transmissibility advantage ( 23 ) . Limitations . There are limitations of this study that should be considered . These include the lack of clinical and epidemiological data linked to samples from this study . Incorporation of these data is an important next step in establishing SARS - CoV2 Delta VOC transmission dynamics in children . Additionally , without longitudinal sampling , any difference in onset and duration of viral shedding between Delta and OV in children cannot be determined . The duration of infectivity likely plays a major role in increased vi - ral transmission of Delta compared to OV and should be further investigated . It is also possible that differences in RT - PCR and culturable virus between children and adults are accounted for by the nature or quality of the swab sampling differences between these demographics . However , the fact that the levels of the housekeeping gene ( BGB ) from adults and children are comparable makes this less likely ( Fig . 3 ) . Furthermore , the same samples are used for PCR testing and culturable virus , and so , if this is an accepted cri - tique , we should not consider similar C T cutoffs in adults and children . Conclusion . The relationship between age , SARS - CoV - 2 viral load , and transmission has not been comprehensively explored and requires further investigation . Continuation of this work also involves monitoring of viral dynamics for new emerging SARS - CoV - 2 VOC , such as Omicron ( B . 1 . 1 . 529 ) , in different age populations . However , the results presented here , showing that Delta variant grows more often and to higher levels from nasopharyngeal swabs taken from children than previous variants of SARS - CoV - 2 , may have revealed changing infection trends within the pediatric demographic with novel VOC . MATERIALS AND METHODS Sampling collection . Six hundred ninety nasopharyngeal swab samples from unvaccinated patients across Manitoba , Canada ( population , 1 . 4 million ) , from March to December 2020 and July to September 2021 were provided to Cadham Provincial Laboratory , the public health reference laboratory for Manitoba , as part of routine clinical care and contact tracing . The study was performed in accordance with protocol HS23906 ( H2020 : 211 ) as approved by the University of Manitoba Research Ethics Board . SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR . Samples positive for the SARS - CoV - 2 envelope ( E ) gene by real - time PCR ( RT - PCR ) were further screened for mutations characteristic of VOC . The screening targets included spike region deletions in amino acids 69 and 70 and single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP ) , including N501Y , E484K , and L452R . If quality and quantity of sample allowed , lineages were further con ﬁ rmed by whole - genome sequencing using the Freed primer scheme ( 24 ) . In addition , levels of the beta globin ( BGB ) gene , a standard housekeeping gene , were used to test the quality of the swab sample and as an nucleic acid integrity control as measured by RT - PCR ( 25 ) . TCID 50 . Aliquots of patient samples were provided to the National Microbiology Laboratory for 50 % tissue culture infective dose ( TCID 50 ) determination . For TCID 50 evaluation , nasopharyngeal samples were diluted 10 - fold and incubated on Vero cells ( ATCC CCL - 81 ) maintained in modi ﬁ ed Eagle ’ s medium ( MEM ) supplemented with 2 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 1 % penicillin / streptomycin , and 1 % L - glutamine at 37°C with 5 % carbon dioxide for 96 h . Following incubation , cytopathic effect was evaluated under a microscope and recorded . TCID 50 and TCID 50 per milliliter were calculated using the Reed and Muench method as previously described ( 26 ) . Statistical analysis . Statistical analysis was carried out as previously described ( 17 ) . Brie ﬂ y , here we present normally distributed data with means and standard deviations and present nonnormally distrib - uted data with medians and interquartile ranges ( IQRs ) . We assessed normality using the Kolmogorov - Smirnov test . We performed between - group comparisons using Student ' s t test or the Mann - Whitney test and used the Fisher exact test for categorical data . We compared nonparametric group medians using Kruskal - Wallis analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) . We considered two - tailed P values less than 0 . 05 sig - ni ﬁ cant . Statistical results are reported as ( median [ interquartile range ] ; P value ) . We performed statistical analysis with Stata version 16 . 1 and GraphPad Prism 9 . In our previous work , we found that adults had a culture positivity rate of 28 . 9 % ( 27 ) . Based on published data that the Delta variant may be 40 to 60 % more infectious than wild - type SARS - CoV - 2 , and assuming that this value would be related to culture SARS - CoV - 2 Delta Infectivity in Children versus Adults Microbiology Spectrum September / October 2022 Volume 10 Issue 5 10 . 1128 / spectrum . 00395 - 22 4 positivity , we would require 116 pediatric samples to detect a 40 % increase in culture positivity rates , with a power of 0 . 8 and a of 0 . 05 among children ( 28 , 29 ) .
