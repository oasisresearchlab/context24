Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) is a single - stranded , enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the family Coronavidae and is comprised of 16 non - structural , and four structural proteins ( membrane ( M ) , spike ( S ) , nucleocapsid ( N ) and envelope ( E ) ) [ 1 ] . It was first reported in Wuhan , Hubei province , China , in December 2019 [ 2 ] and was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern ( PHEIC ) in January 2020 [ 3 , 4 ] . World Health Organization ( WHO ) declared COVID - 19 a pandemic on March 11 , 2020 [ 5 ] . The current pandamic was third outbreak of coronavirus in humans after severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) in China in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [ 6 ] . The clinical manifestation of COVID - 19 ranges from asymptomatic , acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) [ 7 ] , and septic shock to severe disease leading to death [ 8 ] .

International traveling has been considered one of the primary routes of its spread among countries [ 9 , 10 ] . According to WHO re - ports , more than 765 million COVID - 19 confirmed cases have been reported , with 6 . 93 million deaths as of April 2023 [ 11 ] . The re - production number ( R ˳ ) , according to current studies , is reported to be 2 . 2 , which means each infected patient spreads the virus to two individuals on average [ 12 ] . It is mainly transmitted through dro - plets from infected persons , especially during sneezing , coughing , and speaking [ 13 – 15 ] . The first case of COVID - 19 in Pakistan was reported on February 26 , 2020 , by a resident of Karachi , Sindh , with a travel history to Iran [ 16 ] . Since then , it has rapidly spread to all the provinces of Pakistan [ 17 ] . As of March 2022 , Pakistan is the Asian country with the fif - teenth most COVID - 19 cases [ 18 ] . Real - time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( rRT - PCR ) is the standard assay for the COVID - 19 diagnosis [ 19 ] . SARS - CoV - 2 infection also elicits immune response and antibody devel - opment like other viral infections [ 20 ] . Enzyme - linked im - munosorbent assay ( ELISA ) based antibodies detection is also used for the diagnosis of SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 21 ] and antibody re - sponse [ 22 ] . ELISA - based immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) and im - munoglobulin G ( IgG ) detection are more convenient , faster , and cost - effective compared to laborious and time - consuming rRT - PCR assays [ 20 ] . Serological data on the population helps determine the pre - valence of subclinical infection to analyze the burden of asympto - matic COVID - 19 infection [ 23 , 24 ] . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first study from Malakand , Pakistan , to characterize the ser - oprevalence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG antibodies in the general po - pulation of the Malakand Division . This study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies ( IgG ) , investigate the prevalence of infection , and evaluate clinical signs and symptoms of COVID - 19 in the Malakand division of Pakistan . Materials and methods Study design and participants A Cross - sectional study was conducted from March 2021 to August 2021 to examine the seroepidemiology of SARS - CoV - 2 in - fection in the Malakand Division of Pakistan . Participants of all age groups were included in the study to ensure the analysis of COVID - 19 spread based on age . The general population , as well as medical workers , were included in the study . Exclusion criteria included in - dividuals who refused to provide consent to use their information or were reluctant to provide any demographic , clinical , or symptomatic details . Serum samples were tested to detect anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG anti - bodies in the Division of Molecular Virology , Centre for Excellence Molecular Biology ( CEMB ) , University of the Punjab and Genome Centre for Molecular Based Diagnostics & Research ( GCMBDR ) Lahore , Pakistan . 623 total participants ( including 41 healthcare workers ) were included in this study . Demographic features ( age , sex ) and clinical signs and symptoms of all the recruited study subjects were recorded through a questionnaire . The ethical com - mittee of the University approved the current study . The workflow diagram of the current study is shown in Fig . 1 . Sample preparation The samples were analyzed for the presence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG antibodies 14 days after the onset of symptoms . The blood samples were taken in a 5cc syringe and were transferred to col - lection tubes . These tubes were inverted a few times , centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min , and the serum was transferred to clean Eppendorf tubes . Detection of SARS - COV - 2 igg antibodies using elisa assay The serum samples were used to detect IgG antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 using a highly sensitive ELISA kit ( Elecsys ® Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 using a fully automated COBAS e 411 analyzer , Roche Diagnostics ) following the standard manufacturer’s manual . This kit uses a recombinant protein containing the nucleocapsid ( N ) antigen to determine antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 . If the COI ( cutoff index value ) is less than 1 , the result is interpreted as negative , while a COI equal to or greater than one is considered reactive or positive for anti - SARS CoV - 2 antibodies . The sensitivity and specificity of the immunoassay antibody de - tection kit are 99 . 5 % and 99 . 8 % , respectively [ 25 ] . All the samples were processed for IgG antibody detection , and a successive follow - up SARS - CoV - 2 IgG antibody analysis was run four weeks later on the participants who worked in the medical facility ( Medical and para - medical staff ) . After the confirmation of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG antibodies , 5 % of the severe cases based on symptomology were further subjected to Real - time PCR . Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from five of these participants . Real - time PCR ( Sa - cycler - 96 Sacace Biotechlogies Italy ) was carried out using a COVID - 19 detection kit ( ARGENE SARS - CoV - 2 R gene Biomerieux , France ) in accordance with the protocol . Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 21 and Microsoft Excel 2016 . Means , standard error means , percentages and fre - quencies for age , gender , COVID - 19 specific IgG , and reactive IgG titer were computed for comparative analysis . A chi - square analysis de - termined the statistically significant differences between study groups . A p - value of less than 0 . 05 was considered significant for all the statistical tests performed . Results A total of 623 participants were enrolled in this study : 468 ( 75 % ) were males , and 155 ( 25 % ) were females . The overall SARS - CoV - 2 reactive IgG count analysis revealed a higher IgG titer mean value in males ( 22 . 29 ± 1 . 6 ) as compared to females ( 17 . 63 ± 2 . 1 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . In our studied cohort , two types of subjects were enrolled , i . e . , subjects working in a non - medical setting and subjects working in a medical setting . Therefore , we divided the data into two groups . In the non - Fig . 1 . Workflow diagram of the methodology used in the current project . A . Ali , M . Waqar , A . Akram et al .

In the medical setting , 15 ( 36 . 58 % , 95 % CI 1 . 43 – 2 . 30 ) of 41 participants showed the presence of reactive COVID - 19 - specific IgG antibodies ( Table 2 ) . Gender - based analysis of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies in the non - medical setup subjects Gender - based analysis showed a higher prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies in males ( 37 . 13 % , 95 % CI 3 . 75 – 4 . 76 ) as compared to females ( 12 . 88 % , 95 % CI 3 . 15 – 5 . 13 ) , though no significant association was seen between COVID - 19 specific antibodies and gender ( p value = 0 . 46 ) ( Table 1 ) . Gender - based analysis of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies in the subjects working in a medical setup Gender - based analysis showed a higher prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies in males ( 50 % , 95 % CI 1 . 93 – 4 . 22 ) compared to females ( 4 . 87 % , 95 % CI 1 . 13 – 4 . 86 ) . There was a significant association be - tween COVID - 19 - specific antibodies and gender ( p value = 0 . 004 ) ( Table 1 ) . Analysis of health care workers showed that 15 workers were infected with SARS - CoV - 2 , and a majority were 21 – 30 years of age with no severe symptoms and not seen any severe symptoms in the studied population , including difficulty in breathing , Persistent chest pain , Loss of speech or movement , and bluish lips or face due to lack of oxygen ) ( Table 2 ) . Age distribution of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies in the non - medical individuals Study subjects were divided into seven age groups for age - wise analysis ( ≤10 years , 11 – 20 years , 21 – 30 years , 31 – 40 years , 41 – 50 years , 51 – 60 years and above 60 years ) . A higher prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies was found in the 31 – 40 years group ( 13 . 23 % , 95 % CI 0 . 96 – 1 . 44 ) . The IgG prevalence in other age groups was found to be : 21 – 30 years ( 10 . 48 % , 95 % CI 0 . 96 – 1 . 50 ) , 41 – 50 years ( 8 . 41 % , 95 % CI 0 . 84 – 1 . 40 ) , 51 – 60 years ( 6 . 3 % , CI 0 . 80 – 1 . 46 ) , > 60 years ( 4 . 29 % , 95 % CI 0 . 99 – 1 . 84 ) , 11 – 20 years ( 4 . 98 % , 95 % CI 1 . 01 – 1 . 89 ) and ≤ 10 years ( 2 . 23 % , 95 % CI 0 . 41 – 1 . 75 ) . A statistically significant relationship was seen between IgG - positive subjects and age groups except for the following groups : ≤ 10 years ( p value = 0 . 041 ) , 11 – 20 years ( p - value = 0 . 550 ) , and > 60 ( p value = 0 . 644 ) ( Table 1 ) . Age distribution of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies in the medical participants The individuals in the medical setting were divided into three age groups for analysis ( 21 – 30 years , 31 – 40 years , and 41 – 50 years , ) . A higher prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies was found in the 21 – 30 years group ( 17 . 07 % , 95 % CI 1 . 05 – 2 . 48 ) . The IgG prevalence in other age groups was found to be : 31 – 40 years ( 9 . 75 % , 95 % CI 1 . 19 – 3 . 20 ) , 41 – 50 years ( 9 . 75 % , 95 % CI 0 . 83 – 2 . 66 ) , A statistically significant re - lationship was seen between IgG positive subjects and all age groups ( Table 2 ) . Comparison of mean IgG titer counts in different age groups Comparison of mean IgG titer counts in different age groups in non - medical study subjects showed the highest mean value in children ( ≤10 years ) ( 31 . 5 ± 11 . 8 ) , followed by 31 – 40 years ( 25 . 81 ± 2 . 7 ) , 41 – 50 years ( 23 . 79 ± 3 . 5 ) , 51 – 60 years ( 20 . 16 ± 3 . 5 ) , > 60 ( 18 . 6 ± 3 . 5 ) , 21 – 30 years ( 17 . 55 ± 2 . 3 ) , 11 – 20 years ( 14 . 5 ± 2 . 92 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . A comparison of mean IgG titer counts was also performed in age groups for medical staff , and the highest mean IgG titer was found in the 41 – 50 years group ( 42 . 81 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . Weekly prevalence and evaluation of COVID - 19 IgG antibodies The prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies among all participants was determined weekly . The number of suspected COVID - 19 pa - tients decreased gradually in the consecutive weeks . In this 6 - week analysis , the seroepidemiology was estimated to be 68 % ( n = 85 , 95 % CI 59 . 07 – 76 . 06 ) in week 1 , 54 . 5 % ( n = 61 , 95 % CI 44 . 78 – 63 . 90 ) in week 2 , 52 . 7 % ( n = 58 , 95 % CI 42 . 24 – 62 . 66 ) in week 3 , 42 . 5 % ( n = 45 , 95 % CI 31 . 13 – 50 . 54 ) in week 4 , 34 % ( n = 32 , 95 % CI 32 . 41 – 53 . 18 ) in week 5 % and 28 . 7 % ( n = 25 , 95 % CI 19 . 54 – 39 . 43 ) in week 6 ( Table 3 ) .

Journal of Infection and Public Health 16 ( 2023 ) 1256 – 1261 1258 Weekly analysis of IgG titer in healthcare workers A follow - up analysis of COVID - 19 - positive patients was con - ducted to see the trend of SARS - CoV - 2 IgG titers . A total of 15 COVID - 19 - positive medical staff were included to evaluate the IgG titer . The comparison showed an increase in the mean anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG titers weekly : week 1 ( 20 . 3 ± 2 . 4 ) , week 2 ( 29 . 24 ± 2 . 8 ) , week 3 ( 46 . 12 ± 3 . 1 ) , and week 4 ( 63 . 65 ± 3 . 3 ) ( Fig . 4 ) . Clinical symptoms in all COVID - 19 patients Clinical symptoms of COVID - 19 - positive patients are shown in Table 4 . 20 % ( n = 61 , p value = 0 . 0006 ) experienced fever , 80 % ( n = 245 , p value = 0 . 0003 ) had headache , 95 % ( n = 291 , p value = 0 . 0001 ) ex - perienced loss of smell and taste , 60 % ( n = 184 , p value = 0 . 0007 ) had dry cough , 35 % ( n = 107 , p value = 0 . 0008 ) suffered from dyspnea , 75 % ( n = 230 , p value = 0 . 0017 ) has diarrhea , 55 % ( n = 168 , p value = 0 . 0028 ) had chills and 5 % ( n = 15 , p value = 0 . 0009 ) experienced myalgia . 40 % ( n = 122 , p value = 0 . 0005 ) had conjunctivitis and 90 % ( n = 275 , p value = 0 . 0003 ) suffered body pain . All these symptoms were seen to be significantly associated with COVID - 19 . Discussion Serology data for COVID - 19 - specific IgG antibodies in the tested population from Malakand division , district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Pakistan , were produced in this study . This is the first study to report the seroepidemiology of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in this region of Pakistan . A total of 49 . 1 % ( n = 306 ) were positive for anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG antibodies 14 days after symptom onset , which is relatively higher than government agencies reported . Different studies con - ducted in China showed a higher seroprevalence compared to this study , with 77 . 9 % showing reactive IgG 10 – 18 days after symptom onset [ 26 ] , 100 % IgG positive 19 days after symptom onset [ 22 ] , and reactive IgG in 83 . 3 % of confirmed COVID - 19 cases and 70 . 8 % in suspected COVID - 19 cases [ 20 ] . We found a high seroprevalence of COVID - 19 was seen in males ( 37 . 9 % , mean = 22 . 29 ) as compared to females ( 11 . 3 % , mean = 17 . 63 ) . This finding is supported by a recent seroepidemiological study conducted in Geneva , Switzerland , where seroprevalence of COVID - Table 2 Analysis of demographic features and anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies ( IgG ) in Health Care Workers .

Journal of Infection and Public Health 16 ( 2023 ) 1256 – 1261 1259 19 was higher in males ( 9 % ) compared to females ( 6 . 9 % ) [ 27 ] , and a similar seroprevalence for COVID - 19 was observed in Spain [ 28 ] . One of the reasons for the higher seroprevalence of COVID - 19 in males compared to females in this study could be the exposure rates as most of the males in Pakistani culture interact more in public dealings , while women tend to stay at home . A higher exposure rate to different people could increase the chance of COVID - 19 infection and spread . In the present study , participants 20 – 40 years of age ( 11 . 7 % , 11 . 1 % ) were seen to have a higher COVID - 19 seroprevalence , while children ≤ 10 years ( 1 . 6 % ) had the lowest seroprevalence . Our findings re - garding age groups and prevalence are parallel to studies conducted in other endemic areas [ 27 , 28 ] . This suggests that adults have a higher prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 IgG antibodies than children . Over the 6 - week study course , a decrease in seroprevalence was observed , ranging from 68 % in week 1 – 28 . 7 % in week 4 . However , these findings are in contradiction to a report from Switzerland in which an increasing prevalence was observed from 4 . 8 % to 10 . 8 % [ 27 ] , and an alternative seroprevalence trend in consecutive weeks was observed in a study conducted in Hong Kong [ 29 ] . A possible reason for the current findings could be due to the government’s policy of easing the lockdown to facilitate citizen participation during the Islamic festival , Eid , which took place one week before the start of this study . Weekly serology antibody response data were generated for four weeks for participants who worked in a medical setting . A rise in SARS - CoV - 2 specific IgG titer after symptom onset was seen in successive weeks . An increase in the IgG titer has been seen in other studies , too [ 20 , 22 ] . A study in China by Jin et al . reported headache , fever , fatigue , and shortness of breath to be clinically associated with COVID - 19 [ 30 ] . Diarrhea , dry cough , body pain , and chills have also been re - ported in SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 31 ] . In the present study , COVID - 19 - positive cases also showed similar clinical manifestations . Con - junctivital congestion , redness , and itchiness in the eyes were seen in 40 % of positive cases , which is congruent with other reports of COVID - 19 from an ophthalmological perspective [ 32 – 34 ] . PCR ana - lysis of tears showed the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 causing con - junctivitis [ 35 ] , recommending the use of eye protection while in close contact with COVID - 19 patients [ 36 ] . Other new symptoms detected in COVID - 19 - infected patients were loss of smell ( anosmia ) and taste ( ageusia ) in many pandemic regions [ 37 – 39 ] . We found loss of smell and taste in 95 % of SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients , in - cluding some subjects having no other clinical symptoms . Anosmia and ageusia are new predictors of COVID - 19 , though some COVID - 19 negative cases have also shown these symptoms in the present and previous studies as well [ 40 ] . This study is significant as it gives insights into this popula - tion’s community - based spread of infection , associated immunity and herd immunity . Assuming IgG titer to be associated with im - munity , an age - wise comparison showed 31 – 40 - year - old in - dividuals to have higher immunity than any other age group of this population . However , other factors , such as health conditions and dietary behavior , may be necessary . This study may give insights to government policymakers about early vaccination of this popula - tion as most of the population is not yet vaccinated . Another cri - tical point is that the most prominent symptoms were headache , body pain , and loss of smell and taste this population , which most individuals do not take seriously and do not get themselves tested for COVID - 19 infection , which can lead to an incorrect estimation of the number of COVID - 19 cases and the death rate of this po - pulation . Further , only 1 . 6 % of children ( 1 – 10 years of age ) showed the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies , though their mean IgG titer was relatively high . This can give insight into the closing / opening of primary schools and decisions for education methods in the presence of COVID - 19 . Conclusion The current study is the first to report the seroprevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 in the Malakand division in Pakistan . In conclusion , our results show a higher prevalence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG antibodies that translates to the attainment of herd immunity in the local community resulting in resistance to SARS - CoV - 2 infection . The antibody positivity rates were significantly high in the most active populations ( males and adults ) , whereas lower prevalence was seen in children . Moreover , the follow - up analysis of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG titer in COVID - 19 - positive healthcare workers depicted an increasing trend of IgG titer in successive weeks . Most participants who had lost their sense of smell but had no other symptoms were COVID - 19 positive . These findings suggest the need for more serological stu - dies to evaluate the spread of this infection , specifically in asymp - tomatic carriers . This would help better understand the prevalence of disease in the population and assist in taking control measures and government policy - making strategies . Limitations of the study The current study has a few limitations , including i ) only a small region of the country was covered , ii ) the sample size is small , iii ) the weekly follow - up was short ) the time between PCR and antibody testing is unknown . Summary points • SARS - CoV - 2 is spreading alarmingly globally without any hindrance . • Serological data of this population indicates the prevalence of subclinical COVID - 19 is common in SARS - CoV - 2 infection . • In a non - medical setting , the gender - based analysis showed a higher prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 in males ( 37 . 13 % , 95 % CI 3 . 75 – 4 . 76 ) as compared to females ( 12 . 88 % , 95 % CI 3 . 15 – 5 . 13 ) . • In a medical setting higher prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 was seen in males ( 50 % , 95 % CI 1 . 93 – 4 . 22 ) as compared to females ( 4 . 87 % , 95 % CI 1 . 13 – 4 . 86 ) . • Age - based analysis showed a higher prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 in individuals aged 31 – 40 years ( 13 . 23 % , 95 % CI 0 . 96 – 1 . 44 ) . • In a non - medical setting , higher titers of IgG SARS - CoV - 2 anti - bodies were seen in the ≤ 10 age group . • In a medical setting , higher titers of IgG SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies were seen in the age group of 41 – 50 . The prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies was determined on a weekly basis . The number of suspected COVID - 19 patients decreased gradually in the con - secutive weeks . • A follow - up analysis of COVID - 19 positive patients was also conducted to see the trend in SARS - CoV - 2 IgG titer . The mean IgG titer comparison showed an increase in the anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG on a weekly basis . • Clinical symptoms associated with COVID - 19 in the population in the Malakand division were also associated with dry cough , body pain , diarrhea , headache , and loss of smell and taste . • This study gives an insight into asymptomatic COVID - 19 infection in the studied area . • Only 2 . 23 % of children ( 1 – 10 years of age ) showed the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies , though their mean IgG titer was quite high . This can give insight into the closing / opening of primary schools and decisions for methods of education due to COVID - 19 . • Such studies play a big role for government agencies to enact control measures to stop the spread of infection .
