The budding yeast Kinesin - 5 , Cin8 , is highly concen - trated at kinetochores in mitosis before anaphase , but its functions there are largely unsolved . Here , we show that Cin8 localizes to kinetochores in a cell - cycle - dependent manner and concentrates near the microtubule binding domains of Ndc80 at metaphase . Cin8’s kinetochore localization depends on the Ndc80 complex , kinetochore microtubules , and the Dam1 complex . Consistent with its kineto - chore localization , a Cin8 deletion induces a loss of tension at the Ndc80 microtubule binding domains and a major delay in mitotic progression . Cin8 asso - ciates with Protein Phosphatase 1 ( PP1 ) , and mu - tants that inhibit its PP1 binding also induce a loss of tension at the Ndc80 microtubule binding domains and delay mitotic progression . Taken together , our results suggest that Cin8 - PP1 plays a critical role at kinetochores to promote accurate chromosome segregation by controlling Ndc80 attachment to microtubules . INTRODUCTION To ensure accurate chromosome segregation , spindle microtu - bules attach to the speciﬁc region of the chromosome called the kinetochore . The kinetochore is a macro - molecular protein complex containing more than 100 proteins that assembles on a specialized centromeric chromatin structure [ 1 , 2 ] . The highly conserved Ndc80 complex has critical functions in mediating microtubule attachment and force generation , as well as controlling the spindle assembly checkpoint , the surveillance mechanism that prevents anaphase until all kinetochores are properly attached to spindle microtubules [ 1 , 3 – 6 ] . The Ndc80 complex binds to microtubules via two adjacent domains : a CH domain and an N - terminal tail . Microtubule binding afﬁnity is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the tail domain in response to the dominance of either the kinase or phosphatase [ 7 – 11 ] . During prometaphase , phosphorylation by Aurora B kinase dominates , weakening the interaction be - tween Ndc80 and kinetochore microtubules in order to allow correction of attachment errors . In contrast , during metaphase , dephosphorylation by the Protein Phosphatase 1 ( PP1 ) domi - nates to strengthen Ndc80 attachments to kinetochore microtu - bules [ 10 ] . In budding yeast , deletion of the N - terminal tail results in loss of tension at the Ndc80 - microtubule interface as measured by a ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) tension biosensor within Ndc80 [ 4 ] . Other important kineto - chore - bound yeast microtubule - associated proteins ( MAPs ) are the Dam1 complex and Stu2 / ch - TOG , which are both re - cruited to kinetochores via Ndc80 . The Dam1 complex contrib - utes to kinetochore microtubule attachment by oligomerizing into a ring - like structure that surrounds a microtubule in vitro [ 12 – 19 ] . Stu2 , which is a microtubule polymerase , also binds the Ndc80 complex [ 20 – 22 ] . Recent studies show that Ndc80 , the Dam1 complex , and Stu2 work together at kinetochores to share the load for chromosome segregation in budding yeast [ 4 , 5 , 21 , 23 , 24 ] . In addition to kinetochore - bound MAPs , cytoskeleton motor proteins also have critical roles in chromosome segregation in most eukaryotic cells . Kinesin - 5 , also known as Eg5 or KIF11 in vertebrates , is a highly conserved homotetramer protein complex with two pairs of motor domains oriented in an oppo - site direction that serves to cross - link and slide anti - parallel microtubules apart [ 25 , 26 ] . There are two Kinesin - 5 family members in budding yeast : Cin8 and Kip1 [ 26 , 27 ] . Unlike Kine - sin - 5 proteins in other species , Cin8 can behave as a bi - direc - tional kinesin depending on whether it works alone or in conjunction with a team [ 28 , 29 ] . Cin8 concentrates on central spindle microtubules during anaphase and plays a critical role in the maintenance of spindle pole separation [ 27 , 30 ] . Although Current Biology 28 , 2697 – 2704 , September 10 , 2018 ª 2018 Elsevier Ltd . 2697 Cin8 and Kip1 are functionally redundant for bipolar spindle for - mation , Cin8 makes a greater contribution to chromosome segregation [ 27 , 31 ] . cin8 D cells are viable at 25 (cid:1) C , but they have a high rate of chromosome loss and prolonged progres - sion through mitosis [ 27 , 30 ] . Unlike kip1 D cells , cin8 D cells are synthetically lethal with inactivation of the spindle assembly checkpoint , suggesting a critical role in the segregation pro - cess [ 32 ] . Cin8 has been reported to bind to kinetochores based on a CEN DNA chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assay and ﬂuorescence localization [ 31 , 33 ] . However , previous studies have mainly focused on the microtubule motor func - tions of Cin8 [ 26 , 28 , 29 , 31 ] , and the functions of Cin8 at kinet - ochores have been largely unsolved . Here , we demonstrate that Cin8 localizes to kinetochores in a cell - cycle - dependent manner , achieving maximum concentra - tion at kinetochores prior to anaphase . Cin8 localization to the kinetochore depends on the Ndc80 complex , kinetochore micro - tubules , and the Dam1 complex . Cin8 directly binds to the Dam1 complex in vitro and associates with PP1 through a consensus PP1 binding motif . Depletion of Cin8 leads to a delay in mitotic progression that is associated with the loss of tension at Ndc80 microtubule binding domains as measured by the Ndc80 tension biosensor . Similar defects are produced by muta - tion of the Cin8 PP1 binding motif , although its kinetochore local - ization is normal . These defects are almost as severe as those in Prometa Meta Interphase Telo N d c 80 ( m C he rr y ) C i n8 ( G F P ) M e r ge Early / Middle Late Anaphase : Dsn1 - HIS - FLAG : Cin8 - 3V5 + + + + _ _ FLAG ( Dsn1 ) V5 ( Cin8 ) FLAG IP 40’ 70’ 101’ FLAG ( Dsn1 ) V5 ( Cin8 ) FLAG IP B M e r ge N d c 80 - m C h C i n8 - G F P Control Noc Low Ben Flag ( Dsn1 - HIS - FLAG ) C D M e r ge S p c 29 - R F P T ub1 - G F P Control Noc Low Ben Cin8 Tub1 Cont Noc Ben N o r m a li z ed G F P i n t en s i t y Cont Noc Ben V5 ( Cin8 - SNAP - 3V5 ) Noc Control Cin8 Tub1 C t N B C t N B 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 1 . 4 * * * N o r m a li z ed G F P i n t en s i t i e s A 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 1 . 4 Meta Interphase Telo Early / Middle Late Anaphase Figure 1 .

The levels of Cin8 that associate with kinetochores were detected by immunoblotting . cells lacking the N - terminal tail of Ndc80 [ 4 , 34 ] . Our results demonstrate that a PP1 / Cin8 complex plays a critical role in producing the tension needed at the Ndc80 microtubule binding domains to ensure normal mitotic progression and accurate chromosome segregation . RESULTS Cin - 8 Localizes to Kinetochores in a Cell - Cycle - Dependent Manner To better understand the localization of Cin8 to kinetochores , we measured its concentration at kinetochores throughout the cell cycle by quantitative light microscopy . The concentration of Cin8 on kinetochores was greatest at metaphase , signiﬁ - cantly reduced in anaphase to approximately 20 % of meta - phase levels , and partially recovered during interphase ( Figure 1A ) . Consistent with this , Cin8 co - immunoprecipitated with kinetochores via Dsn1 ( Figure 1B , left ) , a core kinetochore protein that is a component of the Mis12 complex ( also known as the MIND complex ) and allows for the isolation of native kinetochores [ 35 ] ( see details in [ 21 , 36 , 37 ] ) . The levels of co - immunoprecipitated Cin8 were highest at (cid:3) 70 – 101 min af - ter a - factor release , when the cells were highly enriched at metaphase ( Figure 1B , right ; Figure S1A ) . To test whether the kinetochore localization of Cin8 requires microtubules , we measured Cin8 levels after treatment with nocodazole , a microtubule - depolymerizing drug . Nocodazole treatment 2698 Current Biology 28 , 2697 – 2704 , September 10 , 2018 induced an 80 % reduction of Cin8 at kinetochores , as well as a (cid:3) 90 % reduction of microtubules compared to control ( Figure 1C ) . We also examined Cin8 levels on puriﬁed kineto - chores after nocodazole treatment and found that they were signiﬁcantly reduced compared to the control ( Figure 1D ) . Interestingly , a low - dose treatment of benomyl , which induces loss in the extent of microtubule dynamic instability ( dynamic - ity ) and an (cid:3) 50 % reduction of microtubules due to preferential depolymerization of non - kinetochore microtubules [ 4 , 38 ] , did not affect the levels of Cin8 at kinetochores ( Figure 1C ) . These results indicate that Cin8 localizes at the kinetochore from early mitosis through metaphase , and its kinetochore localization requires kinetochore microtubules , but it does not require the normal level of kinetochore microtubule dy - namicity or the normal concentration of non - kinetochore spin - dle microtubules . The core structural kinetochore proteins , including the Ndc80 complex , Dam1 complex , and constitutive centromere - associ - ated protein network ( CCAN ) proteins , are stably associated with kinetochores during metaphase [ 39 ] . To test whether Cin8 is also stably associated with kinetochores , we analyzed A B C D Figure 2 .

The plot of Cin8 bound to Ndc80 or Dam1 versus input Cin8 is shown ( right ) . the turnover rate of Cin8 - GFP using ﬂuorescence recovery after photo - bleaching ( FRAP ) . The half - life for ﬂuores - cence recovery after photobleaching of kinetochore Cin8 - GFP was (cid:3) 35 – 40 s ( Figures S1B and S1C ) . Thus , Cin8 is a dynamic component of the kinetochore , unlike the core structural proteins . Cin8 - Dam1 Interaction Promotes Cin8 Kinetochore Localization Next , we more speciﬁcally investigated the location of Cin8 rela - tive to the kinetochore Ndc80 complex . We determined the po - sitions of the C terminus of Cin8 and the C terminus of Ndc80 relative to the spindle pole body ( Spc29 ) by ﬂuorescence co - localization . The mean position of the C terminus of Cin8 localized outside ( toward the pole ) of the mean position of the C terminus of Ndc80 , near the expected position of the N termi - nus of Ndc80 ( Figure 2A ) [ 40 , 41 ] . From this localization result , we hypothesized that Cin8 may interact with the proteins located near the N terminus of the Ndc80 complex , such as the Ndc80 and the Dam1 complexes . To test this hypothesis , we analyzed Cin8 levels at kinetochores in cells depleted of Ndc80 or Dam1 by a quantitative light microscopy ( LM ) method ( Figure 2B ) . The Ndc80 and Dam1 proteins were fused at the endogenous locus to the auxin - inducible degron ( AID ) epitope tag to mediate degradation of the corresponding proteins in the presence of Current Biology 28 , 2697 – 2704 , September 10 , 2018 2699 auxin and the F box protein OsTir1 [ 42 ] . There was a signiﬁcant decrease in Cin8 levels at the kinetochore in both strains , so we further examined this by purifying kinetochores from cells containing temperature - sensitive mutants in the Ndc80 and Dam1 complexes ( ndc80 - 1 and dad1 - 1 , respectively ) . To ensure that cells were at similar cell - cycle stages , we puriﬁed the kinet - ochores from cells arrested in metaphase prior to the tempera - ture shift . Consistent with the microscopy data , the levels of co - immunoprecipitated Cin8 were less than 10 % of the control levels in ndc80 - 1 mutant cells and signiﬁcantly reduced in dad1 - 1 cells ( a member of the Dam1 complex ) ( Figure 2C ) . Because inactivation of Ndc80 induces the loss of proteins asso - ciated with Ndc80 , including the Dam1 complex [ 15 , 19 , 43 , 44 ] , we tested whether Cin8 interacts directly with Ndc80 or Dam1 complexes by performing in vitro binding assays . The Ndc80 complex or Dam1 complex was immobilized on beads ( see [ 21 ] for methods ) , and increasing amounts of puriﬁed Cin8 were added . There was a dose - dependent increase in the amount of Cin8 that bound to the Dam1 complex , but not to Ndc80 , indicating that Cin8 directly associates with the Dam1 complex ( Figure 2D ) . Taken together , these results suggest that the Dam1 complex is a receptor for Cin8 at the kinetochore . However , there is still some Cin8 on kinetochores puriﬁed from cells lacking Dam1 , suggesting that there may be one or more additional Cin8 receptors at the kinetochore in vivo . Because this residual localization is abolished when Ndc80 is mutated , it is possible that Ndc80 is required for the localization of all Cin8 receptors or that the defect in microtubule attachments in ndc80 mutants prevents Cin8 from localizing to kinetochores .

Cin8 Is Essential for Proper Mitotic Progression and Tension at the Microtubule Binding Domains of Ndc80 In order to investigate the functions of Cin8 at the kinetochore , we measured mitotic duration by time - lapse imaging in cells in which Cin8 was deleted . cin8 D cells were severely delayed be - tween prometaphase and anaphase onset , in addition to the earlier - reported signiﬁcant delay in anaphase progression ( Fig - ure 3A ) [ 30 ] . We previously found that tension at the microtubule binding domains of Ndc80 is essential for proper mitotic pro - gression [ 4 ] . To examine whether loss of CIN8 affects mitotic progression due to a lack of tension at the Ndc80 microtubule binding domains , we analyzed Ndc80 tension in cin8 D cells us - ing the Ndc80 tension sensor [ 4 ] . Cells lacking Cin8 had a signif - icant loss of tension at the Ndc80 microtubule binding domains as revealed by higher FRET emission ratios compared to controls in prometaphase and metaphase , when Cin8 strongly localizes at kinetochores ( Figure 3B ) . The mean values of FRET emission ratio in cin8 D cells at prometaphase and metaphase were near 3 . 8 and 3 . 4 , respectively . These values are close to the values of zero tension in the FRET sensor as measured by in vitro and in vivo experiments [ 4 ] , indicating that Cin8 is essen - tial for producing proper tension at the microtubule binding do - mains of Ndc80 . We then asked what causes the loss of this Ndc80 tension in cin8 D cells . A previous study reported that the protein copy numbers of the Ndc80 and Dam1 complexes , as well as micro - tubule dynamicity , are critical to induce proper tension at Ndc80 [ 4 ] . We therefore examined the kinetochore levels of Ndc80 and Nuf2 ( another component of the Ndc80 complex ) in cin8 D cells at metaphase and found that they were similar to those of control cells ( Figure S2A ) . Next , we measured the levels of three components in the Dam1 complex at kinetochores in cin8 D cells and found no signiﬁcant difference for Dad1 , Dad3 , and Ask1 protein levels compared to control cells ( Figure S2B ) . 2700 Current Biology 28 , 2697 – 2704 , September 10 , 2018 There was also no signiﬁcant difference in the stoichiometry of core structural kinetochore components when puriﬁed kineto - chores were examined by silver - stained PAGE ( Figure S2C ) [ 5 , 21 , 37 ] . Lastly , we examined the degree of microtubule dy - namicity by FRAP but did not detect signiﬁcant differences in the rates of FRAP between control and cin8 D cells ( Figure S2D ) . As expected [ 38 ] , wild - type cells treated with a low dose of benomyl exhibited a severe delay in microtubule ﬂuorescence recovery ( Figure S2D ) . These results imply that Cin8 is involved in controlling tension at the microtubule binding domains of Ndc80 without changing microtubule dynamicity or the amount of Ndc80 and Dam1 complexes at kinetochores . The N - terminal tail of Ndc80 is required to generate tension [ 4 ] , and we noticed that the phenotypes of the cin8 D cells are very similar to those in an Ndc80 mutant lacking the tail ( Ndc80 tail - less ) ( Figures 3A and 3B ) [ 4 , 30 , 34 ] . To determine whether Cin8 might act through the Ndc80 tail , we constructed cells lack - ing both Cin8 and the tail domain of Ndc80 and examined their phenotype . There was no additional mitotic delay in the dou - ble - mutant cells ( Figure S3A ) , suggesting that Cin8 may be involved in tension control at the N - terminal tail of Ndc80 . The N - terminal tail of Ndc80 is not responsible for recruiting Cin8 to kinetochores since Cin8 levels at kinetochores did not change in Ndc80 tailless mutant cells compared to the control ( Figure S3B ) . Cin8 Recruits PP1 to Mediate Proper Mitotic Progression and Tension at Ndc80 The afﬁnity of the Ndc80 tail for microtubules is regulated by the degree of phosphorylation , which is mediated by the balance of Aurora B kinase activity and the opposing PP1 phosphatase [ 4 , 9 – 11 , 23 ] . When kinetochores establish bi - oriented attach - ments at metaphase , Ndc80 should be dephosphorylated by PP1 to increase its afﬁnity for kinetochore microtubules to generate maximal force production [ 10 , 45 ] . Because Cin8 deple - tion didnot alter the loss of Ndc80 tension exhibited by the Ndc80 tailless , we hypothesized that Cin8 may contribute to dephos - phorylation of the Ndc80 tail to enhance microtubule binding A B C D E F G Figure 4 . Cin8 Binds to PP1 to Promote Mitotic Progression and Tension at Ndc80 ( A ) Cin8 was immunoprecipitated from cells ex - pressing Cin8 - 3V5 , Glc7 - 3GFP , or Cin8 - 3V5 / Glc7 - 3GFP , and the levels of associated Glc7 were analyzed by immunoblotting .

( G ) Schematic models of how yeast Kinesin - 5 regulates proper force production at the microtu - bule binding domains of Ndc80 . In wild - type cells , Cin8 recruits PP1 to kinetochores during early mitosis in manner that requires microtubules and Ndc80 and Dam1 complexes . This leads to PP1 dephosphorylation of the Ndc80 N terminus to strengthen its attachment to microtubules and to produce force for proper mitotic progression . In Cin8 - depleted cells , kinetochore - microtubule at - tachments are weak because the N - terminal tail of Ndc80 remains phosphorylated due to the loss of PP1 . Current Biology 28 , 2697 – 2704 , September 10 , 2018 2701 afﬁnity . PP1 opposes Aurora B phosphorylation , so we tested whether Cin8 associates with PP1 by a co - immunoprecipitation assay . Indeed , the catalytic subunit of PP1 , Glc7 , co - puriﬁed with Cin8 ( Figure 4A ) . To determine whether the association is through direct binding to Cin8 , we analyzed Cin8 for PP1 binding motifs and found two conserved binding motifs ( Figure 4B ) ; one ( RVKW ) is in the unstructured region between coiled - coils 3 and 4 , and another ( RVDF ) is in coiled - coil 2 , which is unlikely to bind to PP1 because it associates with unstructured regions . We therefore made mutants in the RVKW motif to abolish Glc7 binding ( cin8 - KAAKA and cin8 - RAKA ) . As a control , we also con - structed cin8 - F467A , a mutant in the Cin8 motor domain that de - creases its microtubule binding afﬁnity ( approximately ten times lower than that of wild - type Cin8 in vitro ) [ 46 ] . We tested whether the mutants altered the levels of PP1 that co - immunoprecipitate with Cin8 . While the amounts of Glc7 that co - puriﬁed with wild - type Cin8andthe cin8 - F476A weresimilar , there wasa signiﬁcant decrease in the amount that co - puriﬁed with the cin8 - KAAKA ( Figure 4C ) . We next asked whether Cin8 contributes to the kinet - ochore localization of PP1 by isolating kinetochores via immuno - precipitation of Dsn1 from cells expressing wild - type Cin8 , cin8 - KAAKA , or cin8 - F476A . Although PP1 levels on the kinetochore were similar to those in cells expressing Cin8 or cin8 - F476A , they were almost abolished in cin8 - KAAKA ( Figure 4D ) . Taken together , these results suggest that Cin8 associates with Glc7 / PP1 through its PP1 binding motif ( RVKW ) at the C terminus , and this helps to recruit PP1 to the kinetochore . We next asked whether a decrease in PP1 at kinetochores is responsible for the severe mitotic delay observed in Cin8 dele - tion cells by characterizing the phenotypes of the PP1 binding mutant . Wild - type , cin8 D , and cin8 - RAKA strains were analyzed for the percentage of cells in prometaphase and metaphase by microscopy ( Figure 4E ) . There was a signiﬁcant increase in cells delayed in mitosis in both cin8 mutant strains , consistent with a role for PP1 binding in mediating mitotic progression . To deter - mine whether this delay is associated with a lack of tension at Ndc80 , we examined whether the cin8 - RAKA cells have lost ten - sion at the microtubule binding domains of Ndc80 using the Ndc80 tension biosensor . The FRET emission ratio at metaphase was signiﬁcantly higher ( (cid:3) 3 . 3 ) in cin8 - RAKA cells than in the con - trol ( (cid:3) 2 . 2 ) , indicating that an almost complete loss of tension as occurs with cin8 D cells and Ndc80 tailless mutants ( Figures 3B and 4F ) [ 4 ] . We note that cin8 - RAKA cells did not alter the level of Cin8 at kinetochores ( Figure S3C ) . These results show that recruitment of PP1 to kinetochores by Cin8 is critical to ensure proper tension at Ndc80 microtubule binding domains and to achieve normal rate of progression through mitosis ( Figure 4G ) . DISCUSSION Cin8 was previously reported to associate with CEN DNA by a ChIP assay [ 33 ] . Here , we show that Cin8 puriﬁes with kineto - chores and localizes near the N terminus of Ndc80 in a cell - cy - cle - regulated manner . We also found that there is a direct interaction between Cin8 and the Dam1 complex . This interac - tion most likely facilitates the enrichment of Cin8 at kinetochores in addition to the interaction between Cin8 and kinetochore mi - crotubules . Because Ndc80 recruits Dam1 to kinetochores , this also explains the lack of Cin8 localization to kinetochores in the ndc80 and dam1 mutant cells . However , further studies are required to reveal the detailed interaction between the Cin8 and the Dam1 complex , as well as the contribution of motor activities in kinetochore localization . A major ﬁnding of our study is that Cin8 controls both tension at Ndc80 microtubule binding domains and the rate of progres - sion through mitosis by recruiting PP1 to the kinetochore ( Fig - ure 4G ) . We favor the possibility that PP1 bound to Cin8 contrib - utes to the dephosphorylation of Ndc80 , increasing microtubule binding afﬁnity . This is because the phenotype of cin8 - RAKA cells is similar to that of Ndc80 tailless , although both of these mutants still exhibit the same level of Cin8 at the kinetochore as controls . However , we were not able to generate an Ndc80 tension sensor strain that also contains mutations in the seven Aurora B phosphorylation sites to test whether it would restore tension in cin8 - RAKA cells as predicted if Ndc80 were the key target . In addition , other kinetochore proteins such as Dam1 are regulated by PP1 , so it will be important to precisely deter - mine the direct targets of the Cin8 - PP1 complex in the future . Our results highlight Cin8 as a major recruiter of PP1 to kineto - chores , butotherproteinsalsocontribute . TheFRETemissionratio of the Ndc80 tension biosensor in cin8 D cells or cin8 - RAKA mu - tants was slightly lower than that of Ndc80 tailless . The Spc105 / Knl1 protein is known to recruit PP1 to silence the spindle check - point [ 36 , 47 , 48 ] , and it could also contribute to Ndc80 dephos - phorylation . Given that there are multiple PP1 regulatory subunits at kinetochores , it was surprising that kinetochores puriﬁed from cin8 - KAAKA mutantcellslackeddetectablePP1 ( Figure4D ) . How - ever , we note that these cells are delayed in mitosis by a lack of tension , so the Aurora B protein kinase will be active and phos - phorylate Spc105 and possibly other regulatory subunits to inhibit PP1 association . Therefore , the lack of PP1 on kinetochores puri - ﬁed from cin8 - KAAKA mutant cells may reﬂect a combination of multipleactivitiesthatcontributetoPP1localization . Nevertheless , Cin8appearstobeasigniﬁcantPP1recruiterbasedontheseverity of loss in tension at the Ndc80 microtubule binding domains . Kinesin - 5 is highly conserved from yeast to humans , but hu - man Kinesin - 5 , Eg5 , does not localize to kinetochores , in contrast to budding yeast Cin8 . However , a recent study reports that the human kinesin - like protein Kif18a recruits PP1 to kinet - ochores [ 49 ] . Additional studies show that PP1 recruited by Kif18a is critical for dephosphorylation of the Ndc80 microtubule binding domains to stabilize microtubule attachment in HeLa cells [ 50 ] . This indicates that human Kif18a acts like Cin8 in budding yeast . Our study has discovered a critical positive - feed - back regulatory pathway that promotes tension at the Ndc80 microtubule binding domains and normal mitotic progression , and this control mechanism might also be highly conserved pro - cess for accurate chromosome segregation in eukaryotic cells .

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS Yeast strains and cell preparation All yeast strains are described in the Key Resources Table and were generated by standard techniques . All yeast cells used for im - aging were grown to logarithmic phase at 24 (cid:1) C in rich YPD media . For benomyl or nocodazole treatment prior to imaging , we added 55 m M of benomyl for low concentration and 10 m M of nocodazole to logarithmic phase cells and incubated for 1 hr at 24 (cid:1) C . For biochemistry experiments , 10 m g / mL of nocodazole was added for 15 min or 1 hr prior to harvesting . For cell synchronization , alpha factor was added to 1 m g / mL of culture for 3 hr . At > 90 % arrest , an aliquot of cells was harvested and the remaining cells were washed 5x in equal volumes of YEP before resuspending in YEP . Cells were monitored for budding as an indication of the start of S - phase ( (cid:3) 40 min ) . Equivalent volumes were harvested every 30 min and ﬁxed or processed for protein puriﬁcation . METHOD DETAILS Auxin Inducible Degradation The auxin inducible degron ( AID ) system was used essentially as described in [ 51 ] . Brieﬂy , cells expressed C - terminal fusions of the protein of interest to an auxin responsive protein ( IAA7 ) at the endogenous locus . Cells also expressed Tir1 , which is required for auxin - induced degradation . 500 m M IAA ( indole - 3 - acetic acid dissolved in DMSO ; Sigma ) was added to media for 2 hr to induce degradation of the AID - tagged protein . In strains with cdc20 - AID , strains were then shifted to 37 (cid:1) C for 2 hr to inactivate the indicated temperature sensitive protein and an additional 500 m M IAA was added prior to harvesting . Protein puriﬁcation Ndc80 was puriﬁed as described in [ 21 ] . Dam1 complex was puriﬁed similarly with the following modiﬁcations . Dad1 was C - termi - nally tagged at the endogenous locus with 3 - Flag and the ﬁrst wash was performed with BH / 0 . 4M KCl . Buffer H ( BH ) contains 25 mM HEPES pH 8 . 0 , 2 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 , 15 % glycerol with KCl at the indicated concentration . Cin8 was puriﬁed similarly with the following changes : Cin8 was either (cid:4) 3V5 tagged or - SNAP - 3V5 tagged at the C terminus . Cells were harvested and washed in BH / 0 . 15 supplemented with 500 m M Mg - ATP . Following the IP , Cin8 was washed in either BH / 0 . 15 for coIP or BH / 0 . 5 for pure protein supplemented with 100 m M Mg - ATP . The ﬁnal wash and storage buffer for Cin8 was BH / 0 . 15 supplemented with 50 m M Mg - ATP . For binding experiments , Ndc80c or Dam1c were puriﬁed and immobilized on Flag beads . Freshly puriﬁed Cin8 was added in 1 / 3 serial dilutions to immobilized protein . Following 3 washes in BH / 0 . 15 supplemented with 50 m M Mg - ATP , proteins were eluted with Flag peptide and run on a 4 % – 12 % gradient gel . Quantiﬁcation of bound and unbound Cin8 was performed using a Typhoon and quantiﬁcation of Ndc80 and Dam1c was estimated by analysis of silver stained PAGE gels with BSA protein standards .

Im - ages were recorded with MetaMorph 7 . 1 software ( Molecular Devices ) on an ANDOR iXON ( DV897 ) EMCCD camera with a total magniﬁcation giving a pixel size of 106 . 7 nm with no electron multiplication . FRET and mECFP ﬂuorescence images were obtained from a Dual - View 2 imaging device ( Photometrics ) with an 89002 ET - ECFP / EYFP ﬁlter ( Chroma Technology ) . This allowed simulta - neous imaging of both the FRET channel ( CFP excitation , YFP emission ) and the mECFP channel ( CFP excitation , YFP emission ) . See details in [ 4 ] . Imaging ( other ) Images were obtained sequentially at 200 nm steps along the z axis using Nikon Element software ( Nikon ) , a Nikon Eclipse Ti micro - scope with image magniﬁcation yielding a 64 nm pixel size from a 100x / 1 . 49NA ( Apo TIRF ) DIC oil immersion objective ( Nikon ) and an ANDOR Clara CCD camera ( ANDOR ) . See details in [ 4 ] . Fluorescence intensity measurement Fluorescent intensity measurement method is essentially as described in [ 4 , 52 ] . The z - axis position of best focus ( maximum inte - grated intensity ) was used for the analysis of sister kinetochore clusters . A 7 3 7 pixel region ( for FRET images and a 11 3 11 for other images ) was centered on a cluster of sister kinetochores to obtain integrated ﬂuorescence , whereas a 9 3 9 pixel ( for FRET images and a 13 3 13 for other images ) region centered on the 7 3 7 pixel region was used to obtain surrounding background in - tensity . Fi = integrated intensity for 7 3 7 region ( integrated counts for the 9 3 9 region integrated counts for 7 3 7 region ) x pixel area of the 7 3 7 region / ( pixel area of the 9 3 9 region pixel area of a 7 3 7 region ) . Measurements were made with MetaMorph 7 . 1 analysis software ( Molecular Devices ) using the region measurements tool . FRET emission ratio ( FRET emission / mECFP emission ) Changes in tension at the Ndc80 FRET biosensor were monitored in live cells by measurement of the emission ratio ( deﬁned as : FRET channel emission ( CFP excitation , YFP emission ) / mECFP channel emission ( CFP excitation , CFP emission ) ) . The FRET emission and CFP emission were measured by the method described above . This is a standard method when the biosensor contains one donor and one acceptor ﬂuorescent protein . Detailed explanations are in [ 4 ] . Kinetochore puriﬁcations Kinetochores were puriﬁed using bead beating lysis as speciﬁed in [ 53 ] . Immunoblotting was performed with Commercial antibodies as follows : a - Flag , M2 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) 1 : 3 , 000 ; a - V5 ( Invitrogen ) 1 : 5 , 000 or a - GFP , JL - 8 ( Living Colors ) 1 : 5 , 000 . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Statistical Analysis All data were expressed , as means ± SD . Statistical signiﬁcance was determined using Student’s t test for comparison between two independent groups . * p < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant .
