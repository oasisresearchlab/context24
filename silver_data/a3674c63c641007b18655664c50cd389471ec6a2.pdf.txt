Unfortunately , the mechanisms underlying EV biogenesis or release are still poorly understood . Recent reports however indicate a role of the actin cytoskeleton in this process . In this study , we have exploited thoroughly characterized camelid nanobodies against actin binding proteins cortactin and fascin - 1 , a branched actin regulator and actin bundler , respectively , in order to assess their roles in EV biogenesis or release . Using this strategy , we demonstrate a role of the cortactin NTA and SH3 domains in EV release . Fascin - 1 also regulates EV release , independently of its actin - bundling activity . We show a contribution of these protein domains in endosomal trafficking , a crucial step in EV biogenesis , and we confirm that EVs are preferentially released at invadopodia , the latter being actin - rich invasive cell protrusions in which cortactin and fascin - 1 perform essential roles . Accordingly , EVs are enriched with invadopodial proteins such as the matrix metalloproteinase MT1 - MMP and exert gelatinolytic activity . Based on our findings , we report that both cortactin and fascin - 1 play key roles in EV release by regulating endosomal trafficking or invadopodia formation and function . Extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) are nanometer - sized vesicles secreted by myriad of cells . EVs mediate local and sys - temic cell - cell communication through horizontal transfer of proteins , mRNAs and ncRNAs 1 . Living cells actively shed two distinct sets of EVs , i . e . microvesicles ( 100 – 1000 nm ) and exosomes ( 50 – 200 nm ) . Microvesicles directly bud from the plasma membrane , whereas exosomes are formed intracellularly within multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) as intraluminal vesicles ( ILVs ) and are released by fusion of these MVBs with the cell membrane 2 . Over the last decade , cancer - cell derived EVs gained more attention as they contribute to the processes of invasion and metastasis in many ways , including stimulating invasive growth , angiogenesis , chemoresistance , establishing the pre - metastatic niche and suppressing the immune response 3 . Consequently , EVs are being recognized as genuine invasive structures 4 . Other mediators of the invasive cell phenotype are invadopodia 5 . These finger - like , actin - rich ventral cell protrusions are responsible for pericellular matrix degradation , which is mediated by focal delivery of matrix metalloproteinases ( MT1 - MMP , MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 ) 6 . Invadopodia thus endow cancer cells with the ability to breach through the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) and basement membrane , hence supporting invasive migration and metastasis . Invadopodia formation is a complex process and requires an intricate interplay between a distinct set of signalling proteins and actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) , necessary for correct actin assembly and branching 7 . Cortactin ( CTTN ) is a key branched actin regulator and scaffolding protein , linking signalling , membrane trafficking and other ABPs to dynamic actin networks 8 . CTTN regulates branched actin assembly via synchro - nised binding with the actin - nucleating ARP2 / 3 complex and filamentous actin ( F - actin ) , at its N - terminal acidic ( NTA ) domain and 4 th repeat domain , respectively .

The latter two proteins enhance ARP2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization 10 , 11 . Besides its role in invadopodia formation and maturation 12 , CTTN has well - established functions in endocyto - sis 13 – 19 and endocytic trafficking 20 – 22 . Fascin - 1 ( FSCN1 ) is an actin bundling protein . The protein specifically bundles parallel ( unipolar ) actin fila - ments , resulting in straight and compact bundles and providing mechanical stiffness 23 . Three actin binding sites were reported , which allow FSCN1 to bind and bundle at least two actin filaments 24 , 25 . FSCN1 was only recently detected in invadopodia where it acts as a stabilizer , enabling long invadopodium lifetime 12 , 24 . We and others have used nanobodies ( Nbs or VHHs ; Variable domain of Heavy chain of Heavy chain antibod - ies ) or single - domain antibodies as research tools to investigate protein function and to sort out molecular path - ways 12 , 26 – 28 . The unique biochemical and biophysical properties of nanobodies , purportedly render them superior to antibodies or antibody - fragments . Moreover , nanobodies can be engineered in such a way that they display a desired function or set of functions , in order to expand their usefulness . Nanobodies can be used to study func - tions of structural ( ‘undruggable’ ) proteins and can be expressed in cells with the purpose of knocking out protein functions 28 . We previously generated stable MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells with doxycycline ( dox ) - inducible expression of thoroughly characterized camelid nanobodies targeting CTTN SH3 or NTA domain ( CTTN SH3 Nb2 or CTTN NTA Nb2 12 , 26 , respectively ) or FSCN1 ( FSCN1 Nb5 12 , 29 ) . FSCN1 Nb5 was additionally coupled to an N - terminal mitochondrial outer membrane ( MOM ) - tag ( MOM - FSCN1 Nb5 ) which limits free diffusion of endogenous FSCN1 at the outer mitochondrial membrane and thus displaces the protein from where it is needed 12 , 28 . All nanobodies have well - established effects on actin polymerization and bundling , and accordingly on invadopodia organization , formation , stabilization and maturation 12 , 26 . EV biogenesis or release is very poorly understood , although mechanisms that regulate the actin cytoskeleton are somehow involved in this process 30 . Moreover , recent literature reports on a synergistic interaction between invadopodia biogenesis and EV release 31 , and CTTN being involved in MVB docking 32 . These observations prompted us to elucidate CTTN’s and FSCN1’s contribution to EV release , using the abovementioned highly characterized camelid nanobodies . In this study , we prove a role of the CTTN NTA domain and demonstrate for the first time a role of the CTTN SH3 domain in EV release . The actin bundler FSCN1 also regulates EV release , albeit independently of its actin - bundling activity . We assess the contribution of these protein domains in endosomal trafficking , a key step in EV biogenesis , and we confirm the close interconnection between invadopodia and EV release . In fact , when inducing an invadopodia pattern change , MVB organization changes equally . Moreover , MDA - MB - 231 EVs are enriched with invadopodial proteins , such as the invadopodia marker MT1 - MMP , and possess gelatinolytic activ - ity . Finally , our data emphasize the importance of discerning genuine EV - regulating from invadopodia - regulating proteins in future research . Results MDA - MB - 231 OptiPrep density gradient ( ODG ) - purified EVs are enriched with EV - markers and lack contaminating proteins . EVs were isolated from pre - purified conditioned medium ( CM ) derived from parental MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells by means of OptiPrep density gradient ( ODG ) centrifugation . The protocol is explained in detail in the Methods Section and is succinctly outlined in Fig . 1a . In a nutshell , ODG centrifugation separates MDA - MB - 231 secretome according to density , ultimately resulting in 12 different density fractions . Western blot analysis shows enrichment of EV - marker proteins CD63 , TSG101 , flotillin - 2 and CD9 in fraction 6 and 7 ( Fig . 1b ) , which are further referred to as EV - positive ( EV + ) fractions throughout this manuscript . These fractions cover densities ρ 1 . 088 g / ml and 1 . 122 g / ml , analogous to previously reported densities using ODG 33 – 35 . Nanoparticle tracking analysis confirmed presence of a high concentration ( average ± 4 × 10 3 particles / cell ) of ± 86 – 151 nm - sized particles ( see Supplementary Dataset File 1 ) , as what is expected when using nanoparticle tracking analysis post - ODG centrifugation 32 , 34 , 35 . All fractions were clear from contaminating cell organelle markers golgin - 245 ( Golgi apparatus ) , calnexin ( endoplasmic reticulum ) , PMP70 ( peroxisomes ) and cytochrome c ( mitochondria ) , thus excluding cell lysis and apoptosis . Shotgun mass spectrometry ( MS ) of EV + fractions resulted in 1 , 217 unique proteins ( see Supplementary Dataset File 2 ) and confirmed presence or absence of the abovementioned markers and contaminants , respectively ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Dataset File 2 ) . When compared to the ExoCarta Top 100 list of exosome markers , 95 proteins out of 100 were retrieved in EV + fractions , including HSP90 - α , HSP70 and flotillin - 1 ( Fig . 1c ) . Of note , these fractions lack the ExoCarta - listed exosome markers serum albumin and α - 2 - macroglobulin , which are most likely contaminating serum proteins 34 , 36 . Organelle contaminants such as prohibitin ( mitochondria ) , GM130 ( Golgi apparatus ) and calreticulin ( endoplas - mic reticulum ) 34 were not detected ( See Supplementary Dataset File 2 ) . Also worth mentioning is the presence of other EV - markers ( ALIX , CD81 and CD82 ) , several integrin subunits , actin , ABPs ( a . o . FSCN1 , vinculin , α - ac - tinin - 1 and 4 , cofilin - 1 , moesin , ezrin , radixin and several subunits of the ARP2 / 3 complex ) , growth factor recep - tors ( a . o . EGFR and TGFR ) , small GTPases ( a . o . CDC42 , RhoA , RhoC ) and a number of α and β - tubulin subtypes ( see Supplementary Dataset File 2 ) . In conclusion , ODG - purified EV preparations derived from MDA - MB - 231 are highly enriched with typical EV - markers and completely clear from contaminating cell organelles . Nanobodies affecting CTTN function or FSCN1 localization induce a decrease in EV release but have different effects on mean EV size . We next set out to investigate the effects of ABP nanobody expression on EV release in MDA - MB - 231 . All ABP nanobodies have well - established effects on actin assem - bly ; CTTN SH3 Nb2 hinders WIP binding 12 , CTTN NTA Nb2 interferes with ARP2 / 3 - mediated actin polym - erization 26 and FSCN1 Nb5 impedes F - actin bundling 12 . Nanobody expression was induced by adding dox and induced cells were grown in parallel with non - induced matching pairs . EVs were isolated by means of ODG cen - trifugation and EV + fractions were analysed using nanoparticle tracking analysis ( Fig . 2a and see Supplementary www . nature . com / scientificreports / 3 SCientiFiC RepoRts | ( 2018 ) 8 : 15606 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 018 - 33868 - z Dataset File 1 ) . Addition of dox as such has no effect on EV release , neither does expression of EGFP , MOM - EGFP or GSN Nb11 ( a nanobody binding the actin severing protein gelsolin or GSN 37 ) ( Fig . 2b ) . Although FSCN1 Nb5 expression does not alter EV release , delocalization of endogenous FSCN1 towards the mitochondrial outer membrane ( MOM - FSCN1 Nb5 ) significantly reduces EV release ( p = 0 . 0276 ) . Both CTTN SH3 Nb2 and CTTN NTA Nb2 significantly reduce EV release ( p = 0 . 0062 and p = 0 . 0397 , respectively ) . Conversely , a CTTN shRNA expressing cell line ( CTTN shRNA1 ) that successfully down - regulates CTTN expression ( ± 80 % reduction , see Supplementary Figure S1 ) , induces an increase in EV release ( p = 0 . 0080 ) ( Fig . 2b and see Supplementary Figure S2 ) . Considering CTTN’s well - established function in endocytosis 13 – 19 , endocytic trafficking 20 – 22 , MVB docking and consequently , EV release 32 , this increase in EV release was unexpected . Next , we treated paren - tal MDA - MB - 231 with ARP2 / 3 complex - inhibitor CK - 666 . The ARP2 / 3 complex nucleates the formation of actin branches 38 and its involvement in endocytosis 14 , 39 – 41 , endocytic dynamics 16 , 21 , 22 and even EV release 32 has been reported . To our surprise , CK - 666 treatment significantly induces EV release ( p = 0 . 0204 ) ( Fig . 2b and see Supplementary Figure S2 ) . Strikingly , both CK - 666 treatment and CTTN shRNA1 expression significantly reduce cell numbers compared to their corresponding controls , but do not affect cell viability ( see Supplementary Figure S3 ) . Nanobody expression does not significantly alter cell counts and viability , nor does expression of Figure 1 . EV isolation protocol flow chart and validation of the technique . ( a ) EV isolation flow chart . MDA - MB - 231 are grown until a density of ± 80 % is reached . Subsequently , cells are washed and the culture medium is replaced by its serum - free counterpart . On days 2 and 3 , the conditioned medium ( CM ) is harvested , centrifuged and filtered to remove dead cells , large vesicles and debris . Next , the CM is concentrated to < 500 µ l using ultrafiltration and loaded on top of a 11 . 5 ml discontinuous OptiPrep gradient . Following 18 h ultracentrifugation , 1 ml fractions are harvested and centrifuged separately to pellet the EVs . Finally , EVs are resuspended in PBS and if desired , stored at − 80 °C . ( b ) Validation of the isolation protocol by Western blot . EVs in the CM are separated according to their density after ODG centrifugation and are harvested in 12 discrete fractions . A representative Western blot of these fractions confirms the presence of EV - markers CD63 , TSG101 , flotillin - 2 and CD9 mainly in fractions 6 and 7 ( EV + fractions ) . All fractions were clear from contaminating cell organelles as indicated by the absence of markers of the Golgi apparatus ( golgin - 245 ) , endoplasmic reticulum ( calnexin ) , peroxisomes ( PMP70 ) and mitochondria ( cytochrome c ) .

Serum albumin and α - 2 - macroglobulin ( dark grey section ) were absent in MDA - MB - 231 EV + fractions but are most likely contaminating proteins . Additional to the proteins detected by Western blot , EV - markers flotillin - 1 , HSP90 - α , HSP70 , CD82 , CD81 and ALIX were identified in the EV + fractions ( light grey and white section ) . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 4 SCientiFiC RepoRts | ( 2018 ) 8 : 15606 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 018 - 33868 - z EGFP , MOM - EGFP or addition of dox as such ( see Supplementary Figure S3 ) . Apart from some outliers , mean EV size of all cell lines typically ranges from ± 90 to 160 nm ( Fig . 2c and see Supplementary Dataset File 1 ) . Only MOM - FSCN1 Nb5 expression significantly reduces EV size ( p = 0 . 0043 ) compared to its non - induced counterpart . To determine whether nanobody expression could interfere with EV protein cargo composition , EV + fractions were analysed by means of shotgun MS ( see Supplementary Figure S4 and Supplementary Dataset File 3 ) . Expression of CTTN NTA Nb2 and FSCN1 Nb5 does not interfere with cargo sorting . However , MS Figure 2 . Nanobodies interfering with CTTN function or FSCN1 localization induce a decrease in EV release but have dissimilar effects on mean EV size . ( a ) EVs of MDA - MB - 231 with dox - inducible EGFP - tagged nanobody ( Nb ) expression ( 24 h , 500 ng / ml dox ) were isolated by means of ODG centrifugation and were subsequently quantified by nanoparticle tracking analysis .

Inducible nanobody expression is illustrated using GSN Nb11 MDA - MB - 231 . α - tubulin was used as a loading control .

( b ) Graphs represent mean difference in LOG EV release ( LOG 10 particles / cell ) between nanobody expressing ( + dox ) and non - expressing ( − dox ) cells with SEM ( n ≥ 3 ) . P 0 . 05 - value was determined by a ratio paired t test . Neither dox addition as such ( p = 0 . 9914 ) , nor EGFP ( p = 0 . 4701 ) or MOM - EGFP ( p = 0 . 3261 ) expression significantly alter EV release . Expression of a nanobody against the actin severing protein gelsolin ( GSN Nb11 ) does not significantly affect EV release ( p = 0 . 2363 ) . EV release is significantly reduced by CTTN SH3 Nb2 and CTTN NTA Nb2 expression ( p = 0 . 0062 and p = 0 . 0397 , respectively ) . FSCN1 Nb5 does not alter EV release ( p = 0 . 7624 ) . Conversely , delocalization of FSCN1 towards the mitochondria ( MOM - FSCN1 Nb5 ) significantly reduces EV release ( p = 0 . 0276 ) . On the other hand , CTTN knockdown by means of RNAi ( CTTN shRNA1 ) or inhibition of the ARP2 / 3 complex by CK - 666 ( 100 µ M , 24 h ) significantly induces EV release ( p = 0 . 0204 and p = 0 . 0080 , respectively ) . * P ≤ 0 . 05 and * * P ≤ 0 . 01 .

Moreover , 60S ribosomal protein L18 ( RPL18 ) was no longer detected in EVs when MOM - FSCN1 Nb5 was expressed . Collectively , these results indicate that CTTN and FSCN1 positively regulate EV release in MDA - MB - 231 . Both SH3 and NTA domain of CTTN are involved in EV release , whereas FSCN1 regulates EV release and size , but independently of its actin - bundling activity . FSCN1 , again independently of its actin - bundling function , and the CTTN SH3 domain may be implicated in EV protein sorting . We decided to exclude the CTTN shRNA 1 MDA - MB - 231 cell line and CK - 666 treatment from subsequent experiments , considering the questionable results . Nanobody - induced reduction in EV release seems related to CTTN or FSCN1 roles in endosomal maturation and / or invadopodia formation or maturation . Endosomal maturation is an essential step in EV biogenesis 2 and interfering with this process can explain a reduction in EV release . CTTN controls late endosomal / lysosomal ( LE / lys ) maturation and consequent retrograde transport to the Golgi apparatus . Knock - down of CTTN leads to a striking compaction of the Golgi apparatus by light microscopy , presumably caused by disturbed lipid trafficking secondary to the maturation defects 22 . We set out to investigate whether our CTTN and FSCN1 nanobodies induce a similar Golgi compaction and thus whether they interfere with LE / lys maturation and trafficking . When compared to a EGFP - control , CTTN SH3 Nb2 moderately induces Golgi - compaction ( p = 0 . 0370 ) ( Fig . 3a , b ) . However , expression of CTTN NTA Nb2 dramatically alters Golgi morphology ( p < 0 . 0001 ) . MOM - FSCN1 Nb5 significantly reduces Golgi area ( p = 0 . 0023 ) , while this is not the case for FSCN1 Nb5 . Of note , EGFP or ABP nanobody expression does not alter cell area ( see Supplementary Figure S5 ) . Secondly , a reduction in EV release could be caused by impeding CTTN and FSCN1 roles in invado - podia formation and function , since there is a synergistic interaction between invadopodia biogenesis and EV secretion 31 . CTTN and FSCN1 are essential proteins for invadopodia biogenesis 7 and our ABP nanobodies induce well - established defects in invadopodia initiation , stabilization and maturation 12 , 26 , 29 . Immunostaining of parental MDA - MB - 231 on polystyrene plates , grown in identical conditions as for EV isolation ( Fig . 2 ) , shows perinuclear enrichment of invadopodial proteins CTTN and F - actin ( Fig . 3c ) , suggesting genuine invadopodia formation . To conclude , these data confirm the involvement of CTTN in endosomal maturation , with both the SH3 and NTA domain playing a role . Moreover , we show a role of FSCN1 in endosomal maturation , independently of its actin - bundling activity . Since MDA - MB - 231 cells form invadopodia during the EV isolation process , nanobody - effects on EV release can also be in part explained by their effects on invadopodia biogenesis , which is indirectly coupled to EV release . MVBs and invadopodia are closely interconnected . It was previously shown that MVBs localize near and dynamically interact with invadopodia 31 . Figure 4a confirms MDA - MB - 231 forming invadopodia on gelatin matrix , which can be observed as F - actin - rich perinuclear dots ( Fig . 4a , left bottom panel ) . MVBs ( CD63 + ves - icles ) organize in a well - delineated region ( middle bottom panel ) and this area colocalizes with the perinuclear invadopodia region ( right bottom panel ) . This is not the case for MCF - 7 breast cancer cells ; these cells do not form invadopodia ( Fig . 4a , left top panel ) and the MVBs are diffusively dispersed throughout the cell ( middle top panel ) . Quantification of the CD63 dot density in MDA - MB - 231 confirms a much higher MVB density at the invadopodia area versus total cell area , or versus total cell minus invadopodia area ( Fig . 4b ) . Colocalization of the perinuclear F - actin ( phalloidin ) dots with invadopodium markers TKS5 , CTTN and dark areas of fluorescent gelatin matrix degradation , corroborates the formation of genuine invasive invadopodia ( Fig . 4c , top and middle panels ) . CD63 + MVBs occasionally colocalize with invadopodia , but both are always near each other ( Fig . 4c , bottom panels ) . ABP nanobody expression affects normal invadopodia pattern formation , giving rise to loosely packed inva - dopodia that occupy more space than sheer perinuclear area 12 . We wondered if the MVB pattern would follow this change in invadopodia spread pattern . ABP nanobody expression indeed induces a significant increase in invado - podia ( F - actin ) spread area , compared to an EGFP control ( Fig . 5a , panels on the left versus panels on the right ) . CD63 + MVB spread area also expands when ABP nanobodies are expressed ( Fig . 5a ) . Quantification of invado - podia and MVB spread area corroborates an enlargement of both invadopodia and MVB area ( Fig . 5b ) . Moreover , in ABP nanobody - expressing cells , MVBs still localize near invadopodia ( see Supplementary Figure S6 ) . Taken together , these results confirm a close spatial interconnection between MVBs and invadopodia in MDA - MB - 231 . MDA - MB - 231 EVs exhibit gelatinolytic activity presumably mediated by matrix metallo - proteinase MT1 - MMP . Mature invadopodia degrade the underlying ECM , achieved by focal delivery of ECM - degrading proteases such as MT1 - MMP ( MMP - 14 ) , MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 6 , 42 . However , we occasionally observed dark areas of matrix degradation on a fluorescent gelatin matrix in the absence of invadopodial protein F - actin ( phalloidin ) , but in the presence of CD63 - punctae ( Fig . 6a ) . A Z - stack shows maximal CD63 signal inten - sity at the top surface of the gelatin matrix ( Fig . 6b , third row ) . This prompted us to examine the matrix - degradative capacity of EVs as such . Accordingly , a fluorescent gelatin matrix was incubated with purified EVs and matrix degradation was analysed compared to a PBS control ( both diluted with cell culture medium ) . Typical areas of matrix degradation 43 can only be observed in the EV - incubated matrix , confirming genuine EV gelatinolytic activ - ity ( Fig . 6c and see Supplementary Figure S7 ) . Western blot analysis and shotgun MS indicate that MDA - MB - 231 EVs are highly enriched in MT1 - MMP ( Fig . 6d and see Supplementary Dataset File 2 ) . Although MDA - MB - 231 secrete MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 ( see Supplementary Figure S8 ) , these proteases were not detected in EVs by MS ( see Supplementary Dataset File 2 ) , suggesting a possible EV - independent way of secretion . Notably , MDA - MB - 231 EVs exclusively contain activated MT1 - MMP , whereas MDA - MB - 231 crude lysate contains both the inactive 64 kDa and active 55 kDa forms ( Fig . 6d ) . No other ECM - degrading metalloproteinases were detected by shotgun MS ( see Supplementary Dataset File 2 ) . Hence , we conclude that MDA - MB - 231 EVs possess intrinsic gelatinolytic activity , which is probably mediated by the membrane - bound metalloprotease MT1 - MMP . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 6 SCientiFiC RepoRts | ( 2018 ) 8 : 15606 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 018 - 33868 - z Discussion In this study , we have investigated CTTN and FSCN1 function in EV release , using invadopodia - forming MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells as a model cell line . We therefore combined the high affinity and precise target - ing of the nanobody technology with the new gold standard for EV isolation ; i . e . ODG centrifugation 34 . CTTN is a critical factor for MVB docking and thus EV secretion . Rescue experiments using CTTN protein mutants confirmed CTTN - mediated actin branching being essential for EV release 32 . Our results are in line with this , as expression of CTTN NTA Nb2 that is known to decrease ARP2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization 26 , results in a lower EV release ( Fig . 2b ) . On the other hand , CTTN SH3 domain mutant W525K did not rescue CTTN knock - down effects ; excluding a role of this domain in EV release 32 . Our CTTN SH3 Nb2 , however , did affect EV release ( Fig . 2b ) . Both nanobody and protein mutant interfere with WIP binding 11 , 12 , but only the CTTN W525K mutant reduces dynamin - 2 binding 12 , 44 . CTTN SH3 Nb2 possibly interferes with the binding of other CTTN interaction partners involved in EV biogenesis or release , contrary to the protein mutant W525K . In line with Figure 3 . Nanobody - induced reduction in EV release could be ascribed to CTTN or FSCN1 roles in endosomal maturation and / or invadopodia formation or maturation .

Conversely , MDA - MB - 231 do form invadopodia which can be observed as perinuclear phalloidin dots ( left bottom panel ) . The CD63 signal organizes in a very discrete region ( middle bottom panel ) and this region colocalizes with the perinuclear invadopodia region ( right bottom panel ) .

Tukey boxplots represent quantification of the amount of CD63 dots per pixel . P 0 . 05 - value was determined by a Mann - Whitney rank sum test and n ≥ 100 cells were quantified for each boxplot . CD63 dot density is significantly higher at the invadopodia region compared to the total cell area ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , or compared to the cell area minus the invadopodia region ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , as illustrated in ( a ) ( bottom panels ) . * * * P ≤ 0 . 001 .

FSCN1 Nb5 impedes FSCN1’s bundling activity , resulting in thin and loosely packed actin bundles 12 . Expression of this nanobody does not impede EV release ( Fig . 2b ) . However , delocalizing FSCN1 towards the mitochondrial outer membrane using MOM - FSCN1 Nb5 12 significantly reduces EV release ( Fig . 2b ) . A different effect of delocalizing ( MOM - FSCN1 Nb5 ) versus interfering ( FSCN1 Nb5 ) FSCN1 nanobodies on MMP - 9 secre - tion was previously reported ; i . e . not FSCN1 Nb5 , but MOM - FSCN1 Nb5 , reduces MMP - 9 secretion in PC - 3 cells 12 . Interestingly , MMP - 9 secretion is regulated by microtubules 45 and researchers demonstrated FSCN1 inter - acting with microtubules through residues that are not required for F - actin binding . FSCN1 thereby positively regulates microtubule dynamics 46 . Moreover , endosomal transport , which is an essential step in EV biogenesis , occurs largely via microtubules 47 . Hence , we speculate that MOM - FSCN1 Nb5 displaces FSCN1 from microtu - bules and thus perturbs its regulating function therein . Supportive for this theory is the observed altered Golgi morphology when expressing MOM - FSCN1 Nb5 , but not FSCN1 Nb5 ( Fig . 3a , b ) . Besides LE / lys maturation and trafficking , normal Golgi assembly and maintenance depends on both actin and microtubule dynamics 48 . Remarkably , MOM - FSCN1 Nb5 expressing cells have significantly smaller EVs than their non - expressing coun - terparts ( Fig . 2c ) , which suggests an additional effect on ILV formation . Strikingly , CK - 666 treatment and CTTN shRNA1 expression result in a specific increase of EV release ( Fig . 2b and see Supplementary Figure 2 ) , corroborated by a noticeable increase in CD63 intensity on Western blot ( see Supplementary Figure 2 ) . These observations were unexpected , as both interventions were previously reported to decrease EV release in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma SCC - 61 cells 32 . Although lower CK - 666 con - centrations were used in the former study , the small - molecule inhibitor is routinely used at 50 – 100 µ M 49 and we previously optimized CK - 666 working concentration for MDA - MB - 231 at 100 µ M 26 . This working concentration induces detectable defects in invadopodia formation and function , and may however affect mechanisms under - lying EV release differently than expected . Of note , the different cell line used in the study may also explain the dissimilar CK - 666 concentrations used and / or the different cell response . Nevertheless , caution is warranted with small - molecule inhibitors , as they often act on molecules with pleiotropic functions within the cell and may induce non - EV - related changes 50 . For example , inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinase ( i . e . an enzyme involved in EV biogenesis ) by means of GW4869 in dendritic cells , surprisingly increases EV release 51 . Up until now , no CK - 666 off - target effects have been published , although its sister molecule CK - 869 can cause plasma mem - brane blebbing in ARP2 / 3 - depleted cells 49 . The unexpected increase in EV release induced by CTTN shRNA1 expression may be ascribed to shRNA off - target effects , of which RNAi approaches frequently suffer 52 , 53 . The fact that we have generated a control scrambled shRNA expressing cell line that non - specifically down - regulates CTTN expression ( see Supplementary Figure 1b ) , further emphasizes the potential promiscuous nature of shRNA . Another possibility is that , for both conditions , the observed increase in EV release results from cellular stress . In this context , André - Grégoire and coworkers recently showed that the chemotherapeutic Temozolomide induces EV release in glioblastoma cells and may even alter EV content , thereby potentially contributing to relapse and aggressive disease 54 . Indeed , tumour cells are known to secrete more EVs than non - transformed cells , probably caused by cellular stress 55 . Accordingly , since CTTN is responsible for serum - independent or growth factor - deprived growth 56 and MDA - MB - 231 were grown in serum - free conditions during EV isolation , knock - down of the protein may induce stress and consequently , an increase in EV release . This also may explain why researchers previously did observe a drop in EV release when expressing CTTN shRNA ; cells were grown in growth factor - replete media 32 . Finally , likewise , the ‘chemotherapeutic action’ of high concentration CK - 666 may induce cellular stress and a subsequent increase in EV release . This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that both treatments significantly reduced cell numbers in our experimental setup , in contrast to nanobody expression ( see Supplementary Figure S3 ) . Hence , our data emphasize the need to exploit different strategies when investi - gating protein function . Relying on one single method may result in false or incomplete conclusions ; the latter was already shown for the actin bundler L - plastin and its role in filopodia extension 57 . In this respect , nanobody technology emerges as a useful complementary strategy . Besides their ( potential ) functions in endosomal trafficking , CTTN and FSCN1 both have roles in invadopo - dia formation and maturation 8 , 12 , 26 . Perturbation of these functions could also have repercussions on EV release . Indeed , Hoshino and coworkers showed that invadopodia are critical MVB docking sites and a determining factor for EV release 31 and we show that MDA - MB - 231 do form invadopodial structures on polystyrene plates ( Fig . 3c ) . CTTN SH3 Nb2 and CTTN NTA Nb2 hinder normal invadopodia formation and maturation 12 , 26 , while both FSCN1 Nb5 and MOM - FSCN1 Nb5 reduce invadopodia stability ( and thus lifetime ) and matura - tion 12 . Conspicuously , despite its effect on invadopodia lifetime , FSCN1 Nb5 expression does not alter EV release ( Fig . 2b ) . This suggests that invadopodium longevity is not an absolute requirement for EV release . Another possibility is that invadopodia are not a prerequisite for EV release . This would mean that all other invadopodium markers tested by others and us ( TKS5 , N - WASP , PI3K 31 and CTTN ) have additional roles in endosomal traf - ficking , which would then completely account for the observed effects on EV release . In this respect , it would be interesting to investigate whether targeting of some ‘invadopodium markers’ in non - invadopodia forming cells , a fluorescent gelatin matrix . Invadopodia are visualized by immunofluorescence of TKS5 , CTTN and F - actin ( Acti - Stain 670 phalloidin staining ) . Perinuclear F - actin dots colocalize with TKS5 ( top panels ) and CTTN ( middle panels ) respectively , and with areas of matrix degradation , confirming the presence of invasive invadopodia . CD63 on the other hand , occasionally colocalizes with F - actin and with areas of matrix degradation ( invadopodia ) , but both signals are always near each other ( bottom panels ) . Boxed areas are enlarged in the bottom right insets and arrowheads Δ indicate areas of colocalization . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 9 SCientiFiC RepoRts | ( 2018 ) 8 : 15606 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 018 - 33868 - z such as MCF - 7 , impacts EV release . Worth mentioning here is that RAB27B - overexpressing MCF - 7 , a cancer cell model that secretes high amounts of EVs 30 , 34 , do not suddenly form invadopodia - like protrusions on gelatin matrix ( See Supplementary Figure S9 ) . However , it seems that invadopodia - forming cells preferentially target their MVBs towards these ventral protrusions for delivery , as MVBs and invadopodia are closely associated ( Fig . 4 and 31 ) . Furhermore , when ABP nanobody expression induces invadopodia dispersion , the MVBs seem to ‘follow’ this pattern change ( Fig . 5 and see Supplementary Figure S6 ) . Recently , Havrylov and Park postulated that EVs are bona fide invasion - associated structures of cancer cells , similar to invadopodia and other specialised protrusive cellular structures 4 . EVs contribute to the processes of invasion and metastasis in many ways 3 . Moreover , there is a strong connection between the invadopodial and EV proteome 4 . Indeed , we also observed many proteins in MDA - MB - 231 EVs that are classified as common invadopo - dial proteins or proteins involved in invadopodium assembly and maturation . These include signalling molecules ( EGFR 58 , TGFR , Src 59 , CDC42 60 , RhoA 61 and RhoC 62 ) , proteins involved in invadopodium precursor formation ( cofilin - 1 62 , several subunits of the ARP2 / 3 complex 60 , FSCN1 12 , α - actinin - 1 / 4 63 and actin 64 ) , invadopodium function ( IQGAP1 , VAMP7 61 , dynamin - 2 65 , MT1 - MMP 61 , tubulins 64 , integrins 66 , talin , ezrin , radixin , moesin 67 , α - actinin - 1 / 4 63 and vimentin 64 ) and invadopodium adhesion to the ECM ( vinculin , paxillin 59 , filamin 68 and integ - rin 66 ) . Unexpectedly , we did not detect key invadopodium markers CTTN , TKS5 and N - WASP 7 in MDA - MB - 231 Figure 5 .

Nanobody expression has a similar effect on the CD63 pattern ( middle panels on the left versus middle panels on the right ) .

Metabolic enzymes GAPDH , PKM , LDHA and G6PD have also been detected in invadopodia 4 and are , with the exception of G6PD , included in the ExoCarta Top 100 list ( see http : / / exocarta . org / ) . These glycolytic enzymes are also highly abundant in our purified EVs ( see Supplementary Dataset File 2 ) . Considering this invadopodial cargo , it is quite conceivable that auto - or paracrine EV uptake could enhance invadopodia formation and function , as was seen by Hoshino and coworkers 31 . It also could ( in part ) explain the observed positive feedback loop between LE / lys fusion of MT1 - MMP vesicles and invadopodia formation and func - tion 69 . Anyhow , our proteomics data further corroborate a close interconnection between invadopodia and EVs . Analysis of EV proteome isolated from stable MDA - MB - 231 cells showed a potential contribution of the CTTN SH3 domain and FSCN1 in EV protein sorting . CD99L2 - sorting could be negatively regulated by the CTTN SH3 domain , whereas FSCN1 , again independently of its actin bundling activity , possibly promotes sort - ing of RPL18 ( See Supplementary Figure S4 and Supplementary Dataset File 3 ) . Importantly , due to the relatively small EV proteome compared to for instance whole cell proteome , analysis of a larger number of samples is needed in order to perform rational statistical analysis and thus , is needed to sort out whether the observed dif - ferences are statistically significant or not . Sinha and colleagues identified other proteins as potentially different cargoes between CTTN knocked - down and control EVs of SCC - 61 cells . However , at least two out of the 22 candidate proteins were false positives 32 . Hence , more research is required to investigate the role of CTTN and FSCN1 in determining EV cargo composition . We observed MVBs colocalizing with areas of matrix degradation , in absence of invadopodium marker F - actin ( Fig . 6a , b ) . Limited by confocal microscopy resolution , it is however not possible to pin - point the exact location of the CD63 signal ( Fig . 6b ; the cell cortex signal is visible in all stacks ) . The signal may localize extracel - lularly and hence originate from secreted EVs that were left behind post - assembly of the invadopodium . On the other hand , the CD63 signal may localize intracellularly and thus may originate from MVBs . In the latter case , it is possible that MVB recruitment precedes invadopodium formation or that MVBs transiently remain after inva - dopodium retraction . Another possibility is that MVB docking and secretion also occur in absence of invadopo - dia . Nevertheless , we show that MDA - MB - 231 EVs possess an intrinsic ability for proteolytic degradation of the ECM , which is probably mediated by MT1 - MMP as MDA - MB - 231 EVs are enriched with the membrane - bound metalloproteinase ( Fig . 6d and see Supplementary Dataset File 2 ) . MT1 - MMP has already been identified in EV cargo of other cell lines 31 , 32 , 70 , whether or not together with MMP - 2 31 , 32 and MMP - 9 32 . Intriguingly , although MS did not detect MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 in EVs ( see Supplementary Dataset File 2 ) , MDA - MB - 231 do secrete both proteins ( Supplementary Figure S8 ) . This may indicate a specific EV sorting mechanism for metalloproteinase MT1 - MMP , yet additional research is warranted to confirm this . MT1 - MMP not only degrades ECM , but also assists in activating other MMPs such as MMP - 2 . In this respect , Hakulinen and coworkers demonstrated that COS - 1 cells - derived pro - MMP - 2 could be activated by EVs purified from MT1 - MMP overexpressing HT - 1080 cells 70 . These and our results suggest that EV - associated MT1 - MMP could promote auto - or paracrine MMP - 2 activation , the latter possibly being secreted in an EV - independent way ( see Supplementary Figure S8 ) . Of note , MT1 - MMP is known to be specifically targeted to invadopodia 6 , 42 , again supportive for an interconnection between invadopodia and EVs . Thus , we hypothesize that EV secretion is a way of redirecting MT1 - MMP activ - ity away from the plasma membrane . Like this , cancer cells further stimulate pericellular matrix degradation in concert with plasma membrane - bound and secreted MMPs . In conclusion , we demonstrate that the CTTN NTA domain , and thus CTTN - regulated branched actin assembly , contributes to EV release . We reveal a role of the CTTN SH3 domain in EV release which , up until now , remained unnoticed by routine use of the W525K mutant . Furthermore , we show for the first time that EV release occurs independently of FSCN1’s F - actin bundling activity and presumably depends on FSCN1’s microtubule - regulating function . Whether the observed nanobody effects are the result of a perturbed endosomal trafficking , invadopodia formation / maturation or both , is still unclear . However , we confirm that MVBs spatially organize near invadopodia and that EVs are enriched with invadopodial proteins . Moreover , EVs possess genuine gelatinolytic activity , the latter presumably mediated by invadopodia marker MT1 - MMP . Hence , our data con - firm recently reported association between invadopodia and EV release ( see summarizing model in Fig . 7 ) , but also highlights the importance of discerning bona fide EV - regulating from invadopodia - regulating protein func - tions in future experiments . We believe that nanobodies can play an important role therein , as they can impinge on protein functionality with surgical precision . Methods Generation of ABP nanobodies .

See Supplementary Methods for a detailed description on the assessment of cell numbers and viability . EV isolation using ODG centrifugation . A brief overview of the protocol is shown in Fig . 1a . A discon - tinuous OptiPrep gradient was used to isolate EVs from MDA - MB - 231 ( described in 34 , with some adjustments ) . In detail , cells were cultured in 5 x T175 flasks until a density of ± 80 % was reached ( day 1 ) . Cells were washed three times using serum - free medium and were further grown on serum - free medium . Nanobody expression was induced by adding 500 ng / ml doxycycline ( + dox , 5 × T175 ) and these were grown in parallel with non - induced cells ( − dox , 5 × T175 without nanobody expression ) . 24 h post - medium change , CM was collected and cells were placed on new serum - free medium ( − or + dox ) for another 24 h ( day 2 ) . On day 3 , CM was again collected and cells were counted using a Bürker chamber . In order to eliminate dead cells , debris and large vesicles , the CM was centrifuged ( 3 min at 75 g using a swinging bucket rotor ) and filtered ( 0 . 22 µ m and 0 . 45 µ m ) . Next , the CM was concentrated via ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra - 15 10 K regenerated cellulose filters ( Merck , Billerica , Massachusetts , USA ) ( 4 , 000 g at 4 °C , spin times of 20 min using a swinging bucket rotor ) until a volume of < 500 µ l was reached . Subsequently , a discontinuous OptiPrep gradient was prepared by layering 3 ml of 40 % , 3 ml of 20 % , 3 ml of 10 % and 2 . 5 ml of 5 % OptiPrep gradient solutions ( see section Antibodies , reagents and buffer preparations in Supplementary Methods ) in a 13 . 2 ml open top polypropylene tube ( Beckman Coulter , Fullerton , California , USA ) . The concentrated CM was placed on top of the discontinuous gradient , followed by 18 h ultra - centrifugation at 100 , 000 g and 4 °C using SW41 Ti rotor ( Beckman Coulter ) . Fractions of 1 ml were collected and diluted with 10 ml PBS ( without Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ) in 13 . 2 ml open top polypropylene tubes , followed by ultracen - trifugation ( 3 h at 100 , 000 g and 4 °C using SW41 Ti rotor ) in order to pellet the EVs ( day 4 ) . The polypropylene tubes were quickly decanted and put upright to drain the PBS . Finally , the invisible EV pellet was resuspended in 50 µ l fresh PBS ( without Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ) and stored at − 80 °C until further use . For isolation of CTTN shRNA1 MDA - MB - 231 EVs , cells were incubated with 500 ng / ml dox 72 h prior medium change ( day 1 ) and were further grown on dox to support shRNA expression . The ARP2 / 3 - inhibitor CK - 666 or DMSO ( control ) were added to a final concentration of 100 µ M on day 1 and day 2 , replacing dox addition . We have submitted all relevant data of our experiments to the EV - TRACK knowledgebase ( EV - TRACK ID : EV180017 , http : / / evtrack . org ) 71 . Figure 7 . Model summarizing the obtained data . Both CTTN SH3 and NTA domain positively regulate EV release in invadopodia - forming MDA - MB - 231 . FSCN1 stimulates EV release independent of its actin - bundling function . EVs are preferentially secreted at invadopodia ( a ) , but we cannot rule out the existence of other MVB docking sites ( b ) . EVs are enriched in invadopodial proteins and auto - or paracrine EV uptake presumably stimulates de novo invadopodia formation ( c ) or stimulates existing invadopodia lifetime and maturation ( d ) . Finally , EV possess matrix - degradative capacity , likely mediated by MT1 - MMP , as the EVs are enriched in the membrane - bound metalloproteinase . MMP - 9 and MMP - 2 are potentially secreted in an EV - independent way and the latter MMPs may be activated by MT1 - MMP ( e ) . The concerted action of all MMPs is responsible pericellular matrix degradation and contributes to the overall invasive behaviour of MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 13 SCientiFiC RepoRts | ( 2018 ) 8 : 15606 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 018 - 33868 - z EV characterization .

EV concentration and mean size . Following EV isolation , fractions were tested for presence of EV - markers CD63 and CD9 by Western blot . Mean concentration and size ( with corresponding standard error ) of particles found in these EV - positive ( EV + ) fractions were determined by means of nanoparticle tracking analysis and each EV + fraction was measured separately . Nanoparticle tracking analysis was performed using a NanoSight LM10 micro - scope ( Malvern Instruments Ltd , Malvern , UK ) equipped with a 488 nm laser and with temperature monitoring . For each EV + fraction , three 30 second videos were recorded and analysed with nanoparticle tracking analysis software version 3 . 2 ( camera level 13 and threshold detection 3 ) . PBS ( without Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ) was used to dilute EV - fractions within measuring range of the NanoSight ( 3 × 10 8 − 1 × 10 9 particles / ml ) . At least 3 biological replicates ( n ≥ 3 ) each cell line were characterized using nanoparticle tracking analysis . A biological replicate consists of an induced ( + dox / CK - 666 ) versus non - induced ( − dox / DMSO ) cell line run in parallel , i . e . same passage number of which EVs were isolated and characterized in parallel . Mean EV concentra - tion of each replicate was expressed as the number of particles per cell , taking all EV + fractions and cell number into account . Seeing nanobody expression has a multiplicative effect on EV release , mean concentration data were transformed to their logarithms ( base 10 ) and analysed using a ratio paired t test ( − dox / DMSO versus + dox / CK - 666 replicates of a single cell line , n ≥ 3 , α = 0 . 05 , two - tailed , Shapiro - Wilk normality test passed ) and using GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad Software , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . For vesicle size assessment , mean particle size of all isolated EV + fractions was plotted and analysed by means of a Mann - Whitney rank sum test ( ordinal and inde - pendent observations which are not normally distributed ; n ≥ 6 , α = 0 . 05 , two - tailed ) , comparing − dox / DMSO versus + dox / CK - 666 of a single cell line ( identical colours on the graph ) .

Coverslips were coated with 0 . 01 % gelatin in PBS ( 1 h at room temperature ) , fixed with 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde ( 10 min on ice ) and quenched with medium ( 1 h at 37 °C ) . For vis - ualisation of matrix degradation , coverslips were coated with Cy3 - gelatin using the QCM Gelatin Invadopodia Assay ( Merck ) and according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Cells were seeded at a density of ± 60 – 80 % onto coated coverslips or in 24 - well polystyrene plates . If desired , nanobody expression was induced by adding dox to a final concentration of 500 ng / ml post - cell adhesion . To investigate EV - mediated matrix degradation , Cy3 - gelatin matrices were incubated with equal volumes of PBS ( without Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + , control , n = 3 ) or EVs in PBS ( n = 3 ) , both diluted with medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum . EVs were diluted to a final con - centration of 4 × 10 10 EVs each coverslip . Immunostaining was performed 24 h later as previously described 27 . Briefly , cells were fixed with 3 % paraformaldehyde for 25 min , permeabilized during 5 min with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 and additionally incubated with 0 . 75 % glycine for 20 min . Every incubation step was followed by at least three wash steps ( PBS with Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ) . After a blocking step with 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , cov - erslips were incubated with primary and secondary antibodies ( 1 h at 37 °C and 30 min at room temperature , respectively ) , with both antibodies diluted in 1 % BSA . Nuclei and F - actin were stained during the last antibody incubation step with DAPI and phalloidin , respectively . Antibody incubation steps were separated by four 4 min wash steps in 1 % BSA . Finally , cells were washed twice with PBS . Coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides using Vectashield antifade mounting medium ( Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA , USA ) and were sealed with nail polish . Cells were analysed at room temperature using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M fluorescence microscope with Apotome module ( Zeiss 63 × 1 . 4 - NA Oil Plan - Apochromat objective , Carl Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) with Axiovision 4 . 5 software ( Zeiss ) , an Olympus IX81 Fluoview 1000 confocal laser scanning microscope ( Olympus x60 1 . 35 - NA Oil UPLSAPO objective , Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) with FluoView FV 1000 software ( Olympus ) or Olympus IX71 inverted fluorescence and phase contrast microscope ( Olympus 10 × 2 0 . 3 - NA UPLFLN phase , 20 × 0 . 45 - LUCPLFLN phase objective , Olympus ) with Cell B software ( Olympus ) . Z - stacks were taken each 0 . 5 µ m with the Olympus confocal scanning microscope . Microscopy images were analysed by means of ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , USA ) . Golgin - 245 , CD63 and phalloidin ( i . e . invadopodia and cell cortex ) spread area were marked out using the free - hand selection tool . Surface area of selected areas was determined using following macro : run ( “Create Mask” ) ; run ( “Analyze Particles … ” , “size = 0 - Infinity circularity = 0 . 00 – 1 . 00 show = Outlines display clear” ) . For CD63 dot quantification , images were converted to 8 - bit ( run ( “8 - bit” ) ) and background was subtracted ( run ( “Subtract Background … ” , “rolling = 50” ) ) . Next , the 8 - bit images were binarised using Li’s Minimum Cross Entropy thresholding method ( set Auto Threshold ( “Li dark” ) ; set Threshold ( 18 , 255 ) ) , followed by classic watershed seg - mentation ( run ( “Watershed” ) ) . CD63 dot quantification was finally achieved using run ( “Analyze Particles … ” , “size = 0 - Infinity circularity = 0 . 00 – 1 . 00 show = Outlines display clear” ) . A Mann - Whitney rank sum test ( ordi - nal and independent observations which are not normally distributed ; n ≥ 100 split up into ≥ 3 independent experiments , α = 0 . 05 , two - tailed ) comparing induced ( + dox ) to non - induced ( − dox ) of a single cell line ( iden - tical colours on the graph ) , comparing invadopodia area to total cell area or comparing invadopodia area to total cell area without the invadopodia region , was used to analyse the results via Graphpad .
