We measured contact patterns 16 weekly from March 2020 to March 2021 to estimate the impact of these policies , covering three 17 national lockdowns interspersed by periods of lower restrictions . 18 Methods : 19 Data were collected using online surveys of representative samples of the UK population by age 20 and gender . We calculated the mean daily contacts reported using a ( clustered ) bootstrap and 21 fitted a censored negative binomial model to estimate age - stratified contact matrices and estimate 22 proportional changes to the basic reproduction number under controlled conditions using the 23 change in contacts as a scaling factor . 24 Results : 25 The survey recorded 101 , 350 observations from 19 , 914 participants who reported 466 , 710 26 contacts over 53 weeks . Contact patterns changed over time and by participants ' age , personal 27 risk factors , and perception of risk . The mean of reported contacts among adults have reduced 28 compared to previous surveys with adults aged 18 to 59 reporting a mean of 2 . 39 ( 95 % CI 2 . 20 - 29 2 . 60 ) contacts to 4 . 93 ( 95 % CI 4 . 65 - 5 . 19 ) contacts , and the mean contacts for school - age 30 children was 3 . 07 ( 95 % CI 2 . 89 - 3 . 27 ) to 15 . 11 ( 95 % CI 13 . 87 - 16 . 41 ) . The use of face coverings 31 outside the home has remained high since the government mandated use in some settings in July 32 2020 . 33 Conclusions : 34 The CoMix survey provides a unique longitudinal data set for a full year since the first lockdown 35 for use in statistical analyses and mathematical modelling of COVID - 19 and other diseases . 36 Recorded contacts reduced dramatically compared to pre - pandemic levels , with changes 37 correlated to government interventions throughout the pandemic . Despite easing of restrictions in 38 the summer of 2020 , mean reported contacts only returned to about half of that observed pre - 39 pandemic . 40 Key words 41 Covid - 19 , Contact survey , Pandemic , Disease Outbreak , Reproduction Number , CoMix 42 .

In England , the 45 government has implemented a variety of measures over the course of the pandemic , including 46 three separate national “lockdowns” [ 1 – 5 ] as well as other local and national measures [ 6 ] . In 47 addition , guidance has been issued on risk mitigation measures during social interactions , 48 including meeting outdoors , maintaining space between people , frequent handwashing or use of 49 hand sanitiser , and the use of face coverings ( masks ) . 50 We conducted a weekly longitudinal survey on the social contacts , behaviours , and attitudes of 51 people in the UK to quantify social interactions over time . We have previously described early 52 findings during the first week of lockdown in England ( 24th to 27th March 2020 ) [ 7 ] . In this 53 paper , we describe observed contact patterns and behaviour in England based on the CoMix 54 social contact survey collected between 24th March 2020 ( the first day of the first national 55 lockdown in the UK ) and 29th March 2021 ( the final day of the third national lockdown in 56 England ) . We present descriptive analyses showing the mean number of contacts people 57 reported and how these differed during three national lockdowns , periods with more relaxed 58 restrictions , and over the Christmas holiday period . We provide a one - year detailed longitudinal 59 account of contact behaviour in England during the first year of the pandemic , create a historical 60 record for future study and policy - making , and improve understanding of the patterns of disease 61 spread and the effectiveness of different policies on reducing contacts to suppress transmission . 62 Methods 63 Ethics statement 64 Participation in this opt - in study was voluntary , and all analyses were carried out on anonymised 65 data . The study was approved by the ethics committee of the London School of Hygiene & 66 Tropical Medicine Reference number 21795 . 67 .

In the UK , participants are invited to the survey and 70 subsequently asked to respond once every two weeks , with two panels of participants who 71 respond in alternating weeks . Initially , each panel consisted of roughly 1 , 500 participants , 72 increasing to about 2 , 500 participants each week from August 2020 ( Figure 1D ) . In May 2020 , 73 we launched two additional panels ( each of approximately 500 participants ) designed to collect 74 data on children’s contact patterns . Parents completed the surveys on behalf of one of their 75 children ( < 18 years old ) who lived in the same household , based on which child had the closest 76 upcoming birthday . 77 A UK - representative sample was recruited by the market research company Ipsos - MORI using 78 quota sampling , with quotas based on age , gender , and region . Ipsos - MORI recruits through a 79 combination of social media and web advertising and email campaigns , and partners with other 80 companies when necessary to meet quotas . New panels were recruited in August 2020 , after 81 the initially planned period of the study was completed and there was a high turnover of 82 participants throughout January 2021 as participants reached their survey limit or dropped out of 83 the study and new participants were recruited . Participants were included for a maximum of 10 84 survey rounds in the first group of panels ( before 9 August ) and 8 in the second group ( after 8 85 August ) to reduce the burden of participating on individuals . Because different policies were 86 employed by the four nations of the UK , in this paper we restrict analysis to participants who 87 reported living in England . 88 The survey design is based on the POLYMOD contact survey [ 8 ] with additional questions 89 about work and school attendance , household composition , use of public transportation , and a 90 variety of others . Details of the early rounds of the CoMix study including the protocol and 91 survey instrument have been published previously [ 7 ] and details of the updated protocol and 92 survey instruments are provided in the supplementary material . 93 Reporting of contacts 94 Contacts that occurred on the day prior to the survey were reported in two ways : individual 95 contacts and group contacts . First , participants were asked to list each contact and their 96 .

Second , we asked participants to report the 97 total number of contacts they had at work , school , or other settings for the age groups 0 to 17 , 98 18 to 59 , and 60 + , both overall and for physical contacts only ( ‘group contacts’ ) . We define direct 99 contact as anyone who met the participant in person with whom at least a few words were 100 exchanged or physical contact was made . Questions on group contacts were included at the end of 101 the survey , and they were added to surveys from the 14th May 2020 to accommodate individuals – 102 such as those working in patient - or public - facing roles – who could not record details of all individual 103 contacts that they made . Since August 2020 , participants were also asked to describe the 104 average time spent with group contacts and any transmission - related precautions they 105 implemented , including distancing , wearing face - coverings , and performing hand hygiene . 106 Demographic information 107 The survey captures information about participant demographics , employment status and 108 whether participants attended work ( or school / university for participants < 18 years old and self - 109 reported students ) in the previous week and on the day they recorded contacts . 110 Risk perception , status , and mitigation 111 Participants were asked questions about their performance of risk mitigating activities and 112 asked to respond to statements regarding their perception of risk . Participants were asked to 113 respond to the statements : i ) “I am likely to catch coronavirus” , ii ) “I am worried that I might 114 spread coronavirus to someone who is vulnerable” , and iii ) “coronavirus would be a serious 115 illness for me” with the likert scale of “Strongly Agree” , “Tend to Agree” , “Neutral” , “Tend to 116 Disagree” , “Strongly Disagree” . Participants self - reported whether or not they considered 117 themselves to be high risk based on definitions given in the survey , which changed between 118 survey versions as government advice changed ( see questionnaires for details ) . Participants 119 were also asked whether they wore a face covering and in which settings , whether they had 120 washed their hands in the three hours prior to the survey , and whether they sanitized their 121 hands in the three hours prior to the survey . 122 Analysis time periods 123 We categorised the dates of contacts in our survey into nine time periods to compare 124 descriptive statistics and calculate contact matrices . The nine time periods were selected to 125 .

While parents answer as proxies for children in the study , we describe the 139 designated child as the “participant” where applicable . We calculated the number and 140 percentage of participants that completed one , two to three , four to five , and six or more rounds 141 of the survey by participant characteristics . 142 Mean contacts 143 We calculated the mean number of contacts and associated confidence intervals with 1000 144 samples using clustered bootstrapping [ 10 ] . Each participant was sampled with replacement 145 and then all observations for selected participants were included in a bootstrapped sample to 146 account for dependency from repeated observations of the same participants . We calculated the 147 mean number of contacts with a moving window over two - week , overlapping intervals to 148 increase the sample size per estimate and to include all participants from simultaneously 149 running panels . While the initial panels were recruited to be representative of the UK population , 150 we used post - stratification weights of the mean by age group and gender ( if available ) to 151 address bias introduced by differences between each sample and the UK population [ 11 ] .

We used the World Population Prospects 2019 156 standard projections overall and by gender for the 2020 UK population [ 12 ] . Estimates of the 157 two - week intervals are presented with the data points aligned to the central time point of each 158 survey round and therefore each data point shown is derived from information up to one week 159 before and after the labelled date . We plotted hospitalised cases of COVID - 19 alongside mean 160 contact data by age and setting to illustrate the relationship between mean contacts and cases . 161 We used hospitalisation data from the UK government online coronavirus dashboard [ 13 ] , which 162 we acquired using the covidregionaldata R package [ 14 ] . 163 We calculated the mean number of contacts in various settings : home , work and school ( all 164 educational establishments , including childcare , nurseries and universities and colleges ) , and 165 “other” ( mostly leisure and social contacts , including shopping ) . The mean number of contacts 166 was influenced by a few participants who reported very high numbers of contacts ( often in a 167 work context ) relative to the rest of the panel . The distribution of reported contacts are right - 168 skewed with high variance . The mean number of contacts shown here were calculated by 169 censoring the maximum number of contacts recorded at 50 per individual per day to reduce the 170 variance , meaning we counted any individual who reported more than 50 contacts as if they 171 reported 50 contacts to reduce the weight of individuals reporting high numbers of contacts on 172 the mean . We have found in previous analyses that censoring at 50 contacts most closely 173 reflects changes in contacts relative to changes in R t over time as estimated by the Real - time 174 Assessment of Community Transmission ( REACT ) study , a large home testing study conducted 175 in the UK with the aim of quantifying COVID - 19 transmission and infections [ 15 , 16 ] . 176 We report bootstrapped mean contacts using the method previously described by responses to 177 questions about reported risk and risk perception , and by employment and income categories . 178 For likert - style questions we group participant responses of “Tend to Agree” , and “Strongly 179 Agree” into one category of “Agree” , and we group the responses of “Tend to Disagree” , and 180 “Strongly Disagree” into one category of “Disagree” . Only adult participants are included in 181 these analyses . For contacts by employment , we only include participants who recorded 182 working on the day in which they were reporting contacts . 183 .

We assumed reported contacts followed a 186 negative binomial distribution , modelled using a log link function , with a random effect for 187 participants by age group ( 0 to 4 , 5 to 17 , 18 to 59 , and 60 years and over ) with post - 188 stratification weights for age and gender ( when available ) based on the UK population . 189 Face coverings 190 We present the bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals of the proportions of participants who 191 reported wearing a face covering in any setting for all participants and separately for only those 192 participants who reported contacts outside the household on the day of the survey . 193 Contact matrices 194 We constructed age - stratified contact matrices for nine age groups ( 0 to 4 , 5 to 11 , 12 to 17 , 18 195 to 29 , 30 to 39 , 40 to 49 , 50 to 59 , 60 to 69 , and 70 + years old ) . For child participants and 196 contacts , we did not record exact ages and therefore sampled from the reported age - group with 197 a weighting consistent with the age distribution of contacts for the participants ' own age group , 198 according to the POLYMOD survey methods [ 8 ] . We fitted a negative binomial model censored 199 to 50 per matrix cell , due to dispersion of the reported number of contacts , to calculate mean 200 contacts between each participant and contact age groups . To find the population normalised 201 reciprocal contact matrix , we first multiplied the columns of the matrix by the mean - normalised 202 proportion of the UK population in each age - group [ 8 , 19 ] . Then we took the cross - diagonal 203 mean of each element of the contact matrix . Finally , we divided the resulting symmetrical matrix 204 by the population mean - normalised proportion of the UK population in each age - group . 205 We used this approach to construct a contact matrix for each of the analysis periods by filtering 206 the contact data by date . For each time period ( table 1 ) we calculated the dominant eigenvalue 207 of the infectiousness and susceptibility corrected contact matrix ( C SI ) , calculated from the 208 measured contact matrix C t and assumed age - dependent relative susceptibility and 209 infectiousness vectors s and i : 210 211 .

This value does not account for immunity in the population , and will 218 therefore be higher than the actual reproduction number at a given time . 219 220 We applied two assumptions of age - dependent susceptibility and infectiousness . First , we 221 assumed that all age - groups are equally infectious and susceptible . Second , we applied a 222 weight for relative susceptibility and infectiousness by age as estimated by Davies et . al . [ 22 ] 223 ( Supplementary information ) . 224 Results 225 Participants characteristics 226 Overall , we recorded 101 , 350 observations from 19 , 914 participants who reported 466 , 710 227 contacts over 53 weeks ( 23rd March 2020 to 29th March 2021 ) . About a quarter of the 228 participants ( n = 4 , 574 ) were proxy respondents ( i . e . the survey was completed by parents on 229 behalf of children ) , and 15 , 340 were adults . The median number of responses per participant 230 was 6 ( min - max 1 - 9 ) with 20 . 6 % ( 4 , 098 ) responding only once . 231 The sample consisted of 8 , 714 ( 52 . 8 % ) females and 7 , 790 ( 47 . 2 % ) males . Participants were 232 assigned social grade based on occupation by the Ipsos - MORI company ( see map in 233 supplementary materials ) , which categorised 11 , 743 ( 63 . 1 % ) participants in social grades A , B , 234 or C1 and 6 , 880 ( 36 . 9 % ) in C2 , D or E . The NHS England region with the most participants was 235 the Midlands with 4 , 029 ( 20 . 2 % ) participants and the North West had the fewest with 1 , 931 236 ( 9 . 7 % ) . The characteristics of the participants were consistent over the different analysis 237 periods , with slight variations over the course of the study , particularly in gender balance and 238 .

For instance , around 14 % of the participants lived in a single person 239 household in the initial recruitment round versus around 16 to 17 % for later recruitment periods . 240 While participants were recruited to fill quotas by age and gender , participation varies by wave . 241 32 . 0 % of participants 18 to 29 completed six or more rounds of the survey , while 27 . 9 % 242 completed only one round ( Table S1 ) . 60 to 69 year olds had the highest percentage of 243 participants complete six or more rounds at 64 . 8 % and the lowest percentage of participants 244 completing only one round at 10 . 0 % . In children’s panels 36 . 6 % to 38 . 7 % of participants in the 245 child’s age group completed six or more rounds and 18 . 9 % to 22 . 5 % completed only one round , 246 not including those with an unknown age group ( Table S2 ) . 247 248 Mean contacts , risk perception , and face coverings 249 Overall , mean daily contacts for working - aged adults ( 18 to 59 years ) recorded over the study 250 period varied from 2 . 39 ( 95 % CI 2 . 20 - 2 . 60 ) during periods of lockdown to 4 . 93 ( 95 % CI 4 . 65 - 251 5 . 19 ) during the summer of 2020 , when many restrictions were relaxed ( supplementary table 3 ) . 252 Contacts for older adults ( 60 + years ) were consistently lower throughout the study period 253 ranging from 1 . 55 ( 95 % CI 1 . 42 - 1 . 69 ) to 3 . 09 ( 95 % CI 2 . 82 - 3 . 39 ) contacts per person per day . 254 Mean recorded contacts for school - age children were more variable , between 2 . 87 ( 95 % CI 255 1 . 59 - 4 . 74 ) contacts per day for 0 to 4 year olds during lockdown when their schools were fully or 256 partially closed to 15 . 11 ( 95 % CI 13 . 87 - 16 . 41 ) contacts per day for 5 to 17 year olds in 257 September 2020 when schools were open ( Figure 1B ) . Baseline surveys , conducted before the 258 COVID - 19 parndemic give an indication of normal levels of contact . The POLYMOD study in 259 2005 / 06 reported a mean of 11 . 7 ( standard deviation ( sd ) 7 . 7 ) contacts per participant per day , 260 with the highest mean contacts per day recorded by children aged 10 to 14 ( 18 . 2 , sd 12 . 2 ) while 261 the lowest were in adults over 70 years old ( 6 . 9 , sd 5 . 8 contacts per day ) . The more recent BBC 262 Pandemic social contact study in 2017 / 18 had similar results , with a mean of 10 . 5 contacts 263 overall [ 19 ] . 264 Following the lifting of Lockdown 1 from late May to early July 2020 , recorded contacts 265 remained low until August 2020 ( Figure 1B ) . Contact patterns rebounded much more quickly 266 after the second lockdown in December 2020 , despite the continuing imposition of restrictions ( a 267 .

Reported contacts were very low during the Christmas period , with a modest easing 269 of restrictions over the holiday period in some parts of England and tighter restrictions in others . 270 Finally , adult contact rates remained low during the third lockdown , with substantial restrictions 271 remaining in place through the end of the study period in March 2021 . The patterns of schools 272 opening and closing was the main determinant of children’s contacts ( Figure 1B and 1C ) . 273 Contacts by setting 274 For adults , contacts made at home mostly reflected household size ( Figure S1 ) and were 275 consistently below a mean of two contacts per day over the study period , with little change in 276 reported contacts across each of the analysis time periods ( Figure 1C ) . Work and other contacts 277 followed a similar pattern to adults : staying low but steadily increasing towards the end of the 278 Lockdown 1 , increasing in August 2020 , decreasing slightly and then returning to levels similar 279 to the Lockdown 1 during the Lockdown 2 in November , and then reducing again over 280 Christmas and throughout Lockdown 3 . 281 During the first Lockdown schools were closed to all except vulnerable children and the children 282 of essential workers , and recorded childrens’ contact rates were very low ( Figure 1B and 1C ) . 283 From early June 2020 until the third week of July 2020 ( when schools were closed for the 284 summer vacation ) there was a limited reopening of schools , but most parents reported that their 285 children continued to be educated from home . Average recorded contact patterns amongst 286 children remained very low during this period ( Figure 1B and 1C ) . When schools re - opened fully 287 in September 2020 , the number of contacts rapidly increased for both school - aged ( 5 to 17 ) and 288 preschool - aged children ( 0 to 4 ) , though the increase in contacts in the latter age group was 289 smaller . Children’s contacts declined significantly during the “half - term” vacation at the end of 290 October 2020 but remained high during the second national lockdown ( November 2020 ) as 291 schools remained open . Schools were closed for the Christmas period , remained closed during 292 the third national lockdown , and reopened on 8th March 2021 . However preschools were the 293 first educational setting to reopen during the relaxation of the first lockdown and were not closed 294 during the third lockdown . The contact patterns of 0 - 4 year olds reflect this , with mean rates of 295 contact for this age group being higher than other children during the periods when preschools 296 were open but primary and secondary schools were closed . 297 .

The 300 relative difference was highest for adults over the 12 month study period during the period of 301 Reduced restrictions with the relative difference of 1 . 59 ( 95 % CI 1 . 54 to 1 . 64 ) for adults ages 18 302 to 59 years and 1 . 51 ( 95 % CI 1 . 45 to 1 . 57 ) for adults ages over 60 years . For children , the 303 relative difference was highest while schools were open during the Schools open , Lockdown 2 , 304 Lockdown 2 easing , and Lockdown 3 with schools open study periods , ranging from 1 . 74 ( 95 % 305 CI 1 . 54 to 1 . 97 ) for ages 0 to 4 to 3 . 03 ( 95 % CI 2 . 82 to 3 . 26 ) for ages 5 to 17 . 306 Precautionary behaviours and risk perception 307 The majority ( around 50 % ) of participants answered “Neutral” to a statement indicating that they 308 were likely to catch coronavirus and this remained fairly consistent over the course of the study 309 ( Figure S1 ) , amongst all adult age groups . Survey participants who agreed with a statement that 310 they were likely to catch coronavirus recorded higher mean contacts ( Figure 3A ) , especially in 311 August 2020 and during the period following the second lockdown . Mean contacts for those who 312 disagreed or were neutral were very similar . 313 Participants who agreed with a statement indicating that they were worried that they might 314 spread coronavirus to others generally had slightly higher mean contacts between the first and 315 second lockdowns than those who disagreed with the same statement ( Figure 3B ) . During all 316 three lockdowns , the mean contact confidence intervals overlap for participants in all three 317 categories ( Agree , Neutral , Disagree ) responding to this question . 318 Survey participants aged 18 to 59 years who disagreed that coronavirus would be serious for 319 them reported slightly higher contacts than those who agreed with the statement , while 320 participants over 60 years of age who disagreed were few in number and reported a wide range 321 of contact behaviours ( Figure 3C ) . Participants who were not high risk generally reported more 322 contacts on average than those who were high risk in both age groups , especially during 323 periods outside of lockdown and towards the end of the third lockdown , with the differences 324 being more pronounced in the over 60 age group ( Figure 3D ) . 325 .

The proportion who self - 328 reported wearing masks increased gradually for both age groups through June 2020 , and a 329 sharp increase in mask use was reported in late July and early August 2020 , shortly after mask - 330 wearing became mandatory for entering shops on 24th July 2020 [ 23 ] . From the 1st of August 331 through 26 March 2021 , mask wearing ranged between 73 % and 86 % for adults 18 to 59 and 332 between 70 % and 84 % for adults over 60 amongst participants with contacts outside the home . 333 Employment and income 334 Participants who were employed part - time consistently reported more contacts on average than 335 full - time or self - employed participants with a wider range of contacts , and full - time workers 336 reported contact means similar or slightly higher than self - employed workers in between 337 lockdowns ( Figure 5A ) . 338 Mean contacts for adult participants over 18 years of age grouped by annual income levels ( less 339 than £20k , £20k to £44 . 9k , and over £45k ) , were similar , and follow consistent patterns of 340 decreasing during lockdowns and increasing slightly between the first and second lockdown 341 ( Figure 5B ) . 342 Contact matrices 343 The contact matrices showed overall higher contacts between all age groups in every period 344 compared to Lockdown 1 , with increased clustering around the diagonal matrix elements 345 indicating higher rates of contact between those of similar ages ( Figure 6 , Supplementary 346 Figure C1 , C2 and C3 ) . This resulted in higher estimates of the basic reproduction number 347 under controlled conditions ( R c ) . The periods with the highest R c were between July and August 348 2020 , which corresponds to lockdown easing and government incentives encouraging the public 349 to dine in restaurants , where contacts particularly increased in 18 to 49 year olds and older 350 adults ( > 60 year olds ) . As schools reopened in September 2020 following the summer vacation , 351 an increase in contacts between children increased R c by a factor of 3 . 17 ( 95 % CI 3 . 06 - 3 . 27 ) 352 relative to Lockdown 1 , or 2 . 12 ( 95 % CI 2 . 05 - 2 . 18 ) when assuming equal transmissibility in all 353 .

However , because early childhood education institutions remained 357 open during Lockdown 3 , higher contact rates were reported between < 4 - year - olds 358 ( Supplementary Figure C3 ) . An increase in contacts between school - aged children and a slight 359 increase in contacts amongst adults were found during the periods when schools reopened during 360 Lockdowns 2 and 3 ( Supplementary Figure C2 , C3 ) . This resulted in an R c much greater than 361 other lockdown periods , for example during Lockdown 2 we estimated R c to be 2 . 42 ( 2 . 31 - 362 2 . 53 , 95 % CI ) and 1 . 60 ( 1 . 54 - 1 . 66 , 95 % CI ) times higher than Lockdown 1 , for equal and 363 COVID - like transmissibility by age , respectively . 364 Discussion 365 Summary of findings 366 We conducted a large , detailed longitudinal social contact survey that has quantified temporal 367 changes in contacts from a representative sample of the English population over the first year of 368 the COVID - 19 pandemic . This period ( from late March 2020 to late March 2021 ) encapsulates 369 three periods of national lockdowns interspersed with periods in which fewer restrictions were in 370 place . Mean contact rates have remained low throughout the year - even at the period of 371 minimum restrictions they were only about half of that observed in pre - pandemic surveys , 372 conducted using similar questionnaires [ 8 , 19 ] . These large reductions in contacts have helped 373 reduce the reproduction number , although only during periods of lockdown has the reproduction 374 number been maintained below one [ 16 , 24 , 25 ] . 375 The survey results suggest that government action was a major factor in the mean number of 376 social contacts , with contact rates dropping markedly during every lockdown . However , it was 377 not the only determinant . Age was clearly associated with contacts , with children reporting the 378 greatest average number of contacts during periods of school opening . Among adults , younger 379 individuals ( 18 to 30 years ) reported the highest mean numbers of contacts throughout the year 380 and the elderly the fewest - a pattern that is consistent with pre - pandemic data , albeit at much 381 lower levels of contact . 382 .

Employment status was also associated with contact patterns , with part - 385 time workers documenting more contacts than others . Income levels were not strongly 386 associated with mean contacts , nor is there any evidence of seasonality in contacts - the 387 observed temporal changes in contacts corresponded to government action and advice . 388 Although easing of restrictions did lead to an increase in contacts , this did not necessarily occur 389 immediately . In particular , the easing of the first lockdown was not associated with a rapid rise in 390 the mean number of contacts until August when the government introduced an incentive 391 scheme to encourage individuals to dine in restaurants , cafes and bars . 392 The use of face coverings was also strongly associated with changes in government policy . 393 Although the proportion of individuals reporting having worn a face covering increased gradually 394 over time , the rates of mask - wearing increased significantly when it became mandatory for entry 395 into shops on the 24th July 2020 . 396 Limitations 397 The survey is conducted online , using a quota - based sample of individuals who have agreed to 398 participate in marketing surveys . This recruitment method is biased towards people with access 399 to the internet and who may be reached by banner ads , email campaigns , and social media 400 advertisements . Participants only received guidance through the text in the questionnaires , and 401 may interpret questions differently . This may be especially evident in the reporting of group 402 contacts . Responses are also subject to recall bias , which may under - or over - estimate contacts 403 depending on the nature of the contacts . Additionally , due to child protection concerns and age - 404 dependent ability to complete the survey , children’s contacts are collected through a parent 405 acting as a proxy for a child , which may lead to inaccurate reporting . Mean contacts are 406 sensitive to a few participants who report many contacts , which we have addressed by 407 assigning all reports of over 50 contacts to 50 contacts . Further research is needed to create 408 standardised methods for analysing highly dispersed contact data , although a standardised 409 approach may not be feasible as it may be context dependent . 410 .

Studies prior to the COVID - 19 pandemic provide a baseline of contacts in 413 several countries which have been used to project estimates of contacts in other countries 414 [ 26 , 27 ] . Many surveys implemented during the pandemic , conducted in countries throughout the 415 world , provide data on behaviour and social contacts during periods of heightened risk of 416 transmission and with restrictions on social behaviour and have been summarized in a recent 417 review of the literature [ 28 ] . CoMix is the largest longitudinal survey in comparison to other 418 surveys in the review and appears to be the only survey to have recorded data every week for 419 at least a year . All surveys in the review reflect fewer social contacts during periods of social 420 restrictions throughout 2020 and 2021 . A number of mobility indices such as google and 421 facebook have been made available during the pandemic , which also provide an indication of 422 movement based on monitoring mobile phones . However , these are less direct measures that 423 reflect less epidemiologically - relevant contacts , and although previous work has suggested that 424 google mobility data correlates well with the CoMix data [ 29 ] the data is usually shared at 425 aggregate level and therefore is impossible to analyse by factors such as age and working 426 status . 427 Conclusion 428 This study quantifies changes in epidemiologically relevant contact behaviour for one full year of 429 the COVID - 19 pandemic in England . Contacts have remained suppressed far below normal 430 levels throughout the year , though changes in contact have occurred following relaxation or 431 tightening of social distancing measures . 432 The CoMix survey is unique in both length and frequency of the data and in its longitudinal study 433 design , which provides a detailed historical record of social behaviour during the COVID - 19 434 pandemic . Importantly , CoMix contact data is age - stratified for both participants and contacts 435 and can be used to construct social contact matrices for age - stratified modelling . This data can 436 be used to inform future outbreak response and can be applied to transmission of other 437 infectious diseases , particularly for a large scale pandemic . 438 439 .
