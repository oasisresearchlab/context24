Three - color imaging differentiated ribosome association with masked and unmasked mRNAs ( fig . S5A ) . b - actin mRNAs hybridized with a second - color probe after protease digestion revealed previously masked mRNAs ( about half of the total ) . Masked mRNAs were associated with brighter ribosomal puncta , supporting the hypothesis that regions rich in ribosomes are part of the same masked complex ( Fig . 2C and fig . S5 , B to D ) . Unbound and unmasked molecules should be washed away during permeablization of live neu - rons . Puromycin eliminated actively translating polysomes , followed by detergent extraction and fixation ( fig . S6A ) . Large , bright ribosomal puncta were retained in dendrites , some containing sin - gle b - actin mRNAs ; in contrast , glial cytoplasmic ribosomal signal was extracted ( fig . S6 , B to D and H ) . After cLTP in detergent - treated neurons , ribosome and b - actin mRNA FISH signal ( Fig . 2D and fig . S6E ) and the size of the optically re - constructed ribosomal puncta ( fig . S6 , F and G ) decreased by about half , consistent with increased dispersal of ribosomes and mRNAs as a result of synaptic stimulation . Increased ribosomal dispersal due to unmasking resulted in increased diffusion of ribosomes and mRNAs . To investigate dendritic rRNA dynam - ics , we employed spot photoactivation of a ribo - somal protein ( L10A ) fusion . Immobile , bright structures surrounded single mRNAs ( Fig . 2E ) . Photoactivated ribosome fusions exhibited diminished motility in dendrites relative to glial cells ( Fig . 2G ) . After cLTP , quantification of ribosome dispersal from photoactivated sites re - vealed that the immobile ribosome fraction de - creased ( fig . S7B ) . Dendritic b - actin mRNAs were immobile , with a small portion under - going active transport ( 18 ) . Upon stimulation , immobile mRNAs exhibited corralled diffu - sion in their local environment ( fig . S7 , C and D ) , consistent with degranulation of a complex that prevents mRNA from diffusing until syn - aptic stimulation . In addition to increased mRNA and ribosome dynamics , cLTP increased protein synthesis of a reporter for b - actin mRNA , consistent with un - masking that correlates with increased local b - actin translation ( fig . S8 ) . The protein FMRP has been shown to be a component of RNA granules and stalls ribosomes on mRNAs ( 19 ) . Fmr 1 knockout brains exhibit a reduction in the postpolysomal fractions ( 20 ) , suggesting a role for Fmr 1 in granule integrity . Accordingly , Fmr 1 knockdown in culture decreased the abundance of masked b - actin mRNAs ( fig . S9 , A to C ) . We observed a similar effect in neurons isolated from knockout animals lacking the b - actin mRNA binding protein ZBP1 ( fig . S9D ) . In the model supported by this work , b - actin mRNA is present all along dendrites and is kept in a dormant state by packaging into inert struc - tures ready to be locally activated . During synaptic stimulation , downstream effectors of signaling pathways locally prompt complex disassembly , putatively allowing active translation of mRNAs at activated synapses . This could be accomplished by regulation of self - aggregating protein motifs through posttranslational modifications ( 21 ) facil - itating cycles of localized RNA granule formation and degranulation , thus making use of the same mRNAs repeatedly over time .

We have developed a transgenic mouse in which all b - actin mRNA is fluorescently labeled . We found that b - actin mRNA in primary fibroblasts localizes predominantly by diffusion and trapping as single mRNAs . In cultured neurons and acute brain slices , we found that multiple b - actin mRNAs can assemble together , travel by active transport , and disassemble upon depolarization by potassium chloride . Imaging of brain slices revealed immediate early induction of b - actin transcription after depolarization . Studying endogenous mRNA in live mouse tissues provides insight into its dynamic regulation within the context of the cellular and tissue microenvironment . R ecentadvanceshaveprovidedinsightsinto the behavior of RNA in real time ( 1 ) . However , most live - cell imaging tech - niques require transfection or injection of ex - ogenous reporters that are typically overexpressed or are missing regulatory elements and binding partners present in the endogenous molecules . Moreover , immortalized cells may not accurately exhibit RNA regulation representative of the na - tive tissue environment .

The resulting MCP mice were crossed with Actb - MBS mice , in which 24 repeats of MBS are knocked into the 3 ′ untranslated region ( UTR ) of the b - actin gene ( 4 ) , to label endogenous b - actin mRNAwith GFP , resulting in MCP×MBS mice ( Fig . 1A ) . b - Actin mRNA , which is es - sential for early embryonic development ( 5 ) , was labeled with the 1200 – nucleotide MBS cas - sette and up to 48 molecules of MCP - GFP ( fig . S2A ) , yet no abnormalities were found by his - tologic analysis ( n = 3 mice ) ; mice were fertile ( fig . S2B ) , and b - actin mRNA and protein ex - pression levels were similar to those of wild - type mice ( fig . S2 , C and D ) . Hence , MS2 - GFP label - ing of endogenous b - actin mRNA did not dis - rupt its function and the expression level in vivo , confirming the physiological relevance of the studies . Localization of b - actin mRNA was observed in primary fibroblast leading edges ( 6 ) , neuronal growth cones ( 7 ) , and mature neuron dendrites and spines ( 8 ) by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) . However , it is unclear how b - actin mRNA localizes in real time . Because loss of mRNA lo - calization occurs in culture , we imaged mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) from MCP×MBS mice within 48 hours after isolation ( Fig . 1B , fig . S3 , and movie S1 ) . Individual mRNA - protein complex ( mRNP ) particles were identifiable in MCP×MBS cells , unlike the background in MCP cells ( fig . S2 , E and F ) . Both single - molecule FISH and GFP labeling in live cells showed that these particles contained only single copies of b - actin mRNA ( Fig . 1D , fig . S4 , and supplemen - tary text ) . The ensemble diffusion coefficient of the labeled endogenous b - actin mRNA was 0 . 09 T 0 . 02 m m 2 / s , similar to a reporter mRNA in a cell line ( 9 ) .

S5 ) than previously reported ( 22 % ) ( 9 ) , possibly due to the differences between the en - dogenous mRNA and the exogenous reporter , or the cell types . Serum - induced localization of b - actin mRNA in fibroblasts appears predom - inantly mediated by rapid release of stationary mRNA and redistribution into discrete cyto - plasmic compartments ( fig . S6 , movies S2 to S5 , and supplementary text ) , although we cannot rule out short movements driven by nonprocessive motors . Neuronal RNA transport granules may con - tain multiple mRNAs ( 10 , 11 ) . To investigate the stoichiometry of b - actin mRNA in hippocampal neurons from MCP×MBS mice , we performed single - molecule FISH ( fig . S7 ) . The intensity histograms of diffraction - limited fluorescent spots indicated mRNPs containing multiple copies of b - actin mRNA in the soma and proximal dendrites ( fig . S7B ) , which decreased with distance from the soma ( fig . S7D ) . In live neurons ( Fig . 1C and movieS6 ) , ~ 25 % ofmRNPsinproximaldendrites contained more than one b - actin mRNA ( Fig . 1E ) . Diffusion of mRNPs in neurons was slower [ dif - fusion coefficient = 3 . 8 ( T 0 . 5 ) × 10 − 3 m m 2 / s ] than in fibroblasts , but ~ 10 % of mRNPs were actively transported anterograde and retrograde ( Fig . 1G and fig . S8A ) with a mean speed of 1 . 3 m m / s ( fig . S8B ) . The ratio of anterograde to retrograde transport was 1 . 1 to 1 . 5 throughout neuronal de - velopment in culture ( fig . S8C ) , which may me - diate constitutive delivery into dendrites . To investigate the activity - dependent dynam - ics of b - actin mRNA , we imaged live neurons before and after depolarization ( 60 mM KCl for 3 to 6 min ) . Pairwise comparisons in the same dendritic regions revealed that there were signif - icant increases in the density of the mRNP par - ticles after KCl depolarization in both cultured neurons ( fig . S9 ) ( 8 ) and acute brain slices ( fig . S10 ) . The diffusion coefficient decreased by a factor of 3 ( fig . S9D ) , and particles with directed motion decreased in both directions ( fig . S9E ) . Therefore , the increase of diffraction - limited spots in the dendrite was not due to transport of mRNA from the soma . We hypothesized that the number of detected spots increased because of the release of mRNAs from mRNP complexes upon stimu - lation . Wequantifiedthenumberof b - actinmRNAs contained in each neuronal mRNP by particle intensity . After KCl depolarization , the number of spots containing single b - actin mRNA increased while the number of particles bearing multiple mRNAs decreased ( fig . S9B and S10B ) . We observed merge and split events of particles ( Fig . 2 , A and B , and movies S7 and S8 ) . Both the split and merge frequencies were reduced after depolarization , but the ratio of split to merge was increased ( Fig . 2C ) . These results suggest that mRNA molecules undergo continuous assembly and disassembly of large mRNP complexes ( 12 ) but favor the released state upon depolarization , possibly for local translation ( 13 , 14 ) . We investigated endogenous b - actin gene ex - pression in native tissue by imaging acute brain slices ( Fig . 2D ) . Transcriptional activity was mon - itored in the hippocampus CA1 region at 20 to 60 m m from the surface before and after KCl depolarization ( Fig . 2E ) . Nascent b - actin mRNA per transcription site increased 10 to 15 min after depolarization ( Fig . 2 , F and G ) , likely because of rapid initiation ( 15 ) . Rapid induction of b - actin transcription was observed in various cell lines ( 4 , 16 , 17 ) but b - actin was not recognized as an immediate early gene in the nervous system , probably because of high basal expression . In - creased expression of b - actin may be implicated in transducing synaptic activity into structural plasticity . The MCP×MBS mouse provides a distinctive tool for monitoring the dynamics of single en - dogenous mRNA in live mammalian cells and tissues . Our results with the b - actin gene suggest that the technique could be generally applicable to other genes to investigate the effect of the tissue microenvironment on single - cell gene expression .

George 1 † Three iron - sulfur proteins – HydE , HydF , and HydG – play a key role in the synthesis of the [ 2Fe ] H component of the catalytic H - cluster of FeFe hydrogenase . The radical S - adenosyl - L - methionine enzyme HydG lyses free tyrosine to produce p - cresol and the CO and CN − ligands of the [ 2Fe ] H cluster . Here , we applied stopped - flow Fourier transform infrared and electron - nuclear double resonance spectroscopies to probe the formation of HydG - bound Fe - containing species bearing CO and CN − ligands with spectroscopic signatures that evolve on the 1 - to 1000 - second time scale . Through study of the 13 C , 15 N , and 57 Fe isotopologs of these intermediates and products , we identify the final HydG - bound species as an organometallic Fe ( CO ) 2 ( CN ) synthon that is ultimately transferred to apohydrogenase to form the [ 2Fe ] H component of the H - cluster . F eFe hydrogenase enzymes rapidly evolve H 2 at a 6 - Fe catalytic site termed the H - cluster ( Fig . 1A ) ( 1 – 3 ) , which comprises a traditional 4Fe - 4S subcluster ( [ 4Fe - 4S ] H ) , produced by canonical Fe - S cluster biosynthesis proteins , that is linked via a cysteine bridge to a dinuclear Fe subcluster ( [ 2Fe ] H ) that contains unusual ligands . Specifically , the [ 2Fe ] H sub - cluster possesses two terminal CN − ligands , two terminal CO ligands , and azadithiolate and CO bridges , all of which are thought to be synthesized and installed by a set of Fe - S proteins denoted HydE , HydF , and HydG . In one recent model for the [ 2Fe ] H subcluster bioassembly pathway ( 4 , 5 ) , the two radical S - adenosyl - L - methionine ( SAM ) enzymes of the set , HydE and HydG , gen - erate the dithiolate moiety and free CO and CN − , respectively , and these ligands are then trans - ferred to a dinuclear Fe precursor bound to HydF , 1 Department of Chemistry , University of California , Davis , Davis , CA 95616 , USA . 2 Institut für Chemie , Technische Universität Berlin , Berlin 10623 , Germany . 3 Department ofBioengineering , Stanford University , Stanford , CA 94305 , USA . 4 Physical Bio - sciences Division , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , Berkeley , CA 94720 , USA . 5 Department of Chemical Engineer - ing , Stanford University , Stanford , CA 94305 , USA . * These authors contributed equally to this work . † Corresponding author .
