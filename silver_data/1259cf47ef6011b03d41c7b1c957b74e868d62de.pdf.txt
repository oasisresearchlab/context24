To this end , fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was used to detect the immobilization of fluorescently labeled ligand caused by binding to receptors in vivo . Measurements of mAb affinity to target antigen within human tumor xenografts revealed a saturable binding iso - therm , from which an in vivo carcinoembryonic antigen den - sity of 0 . 56 nmol (cid:121) g ( 5 . 0 (cid:51) 10 5 (cid:121) cell ) and an association constant of K a (cid:182) 4 (cid:51) 10 7 M (cid:50) 1 were estimated . The present method can be adapted for in vivo studies of cell signaling , targeted drugs , gene therapy , and other processes involving receptor - ligand binding . Specific receptor – ligand binding is crucial to the function of many biologically active molecules and is the basis for a wide range of novel therapeutic and diagnostic strategies . Controversy regard - ingtheperformanceofreceptor - targetingagents ( 1 – 3 ) hasarisen , in part , from uncertainties in evaluating binding in situ . In vitro measurements may be misleading due to in vivo differences in receptor density , presentation , and accessibility , and due to microenvironment - related changes in binding kinetics ( 4 – 6 ) . We devised a method to measure binding directly at a microscopic level in living tissue by applying fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) to detect receptor - mediated immobili - zation of fluorescently labeled ligand . With the FRAP technique , the movement of fluorescently labeled molecules is made evident by exposing the region of interest to a pulse of focused laser light to create a microscopic photobleached pattern that then dissipates due to local trans - port phenomena . This approach has been used extensively to detect binding in cell membranes ( 7 , 8 ) , cytoplasm ( 9 , 10 ) , and various in vitro preparations ( 11 – 16 ) . We previously applied FRAP in vivo to measure the interstitial diffusion and con - vection of albumin within a tumor tissue preparation ( 17 ) , and we report here the application of FRAP to measure binding in vivo . Fluorescent ligand is introduced into tissue , and the fluorescence redistribution after laser exposure is recorded as a series of digital images from which the molecular mobility is calculated . Apparent binding affinity K app , the ratio of bound to free ligand , is inferred from the mobility reduction com - pared with an equivalent nonspecific molecule . An in vivo binding isotherm is then constructed by measuring apparent affinity at various ligand concentrations . MATERIALS AND METHODS Fluorescent Ligand . In this study , the tumor - associated antigen carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) and the CEA - specific mAb ZCE025 constitute the receptor – ligand system . We examined both bivalent ( intact IgG ) and monovalent ( Fab (cid:57) fragment ) forms of the ligand . Control measurements were performed using S1 , a nonspecific mAb of the same IgG 1 isotype . The antibodies ( provided by Hybritech ) were labeled with fluorescein ( Molecular Probes ) at approximate molar ratios of 6 per IgG and 2 . 3 per Fab (cid:57) . A competitive binding assay confirmed that the conjugated anti - CEA molecules retained their high binding affinity : suspensions of LS174T cells were incubated at various ratios of labeled (cid:121) unlabeled mAb , and the mean cell fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry . For both IgG and Fab (cid:57) , the data ( not shown ) indicated an association constant K a ( M (cid:50) 1 ) 80 – 90 % of the value for its unlabeled counterpart . The association constant of ZCE025 was previously measured in vitro to be 6 (cid:51) 10 9 M (cid:50) 1 ( IgG ) and 9 (cid:51) 10 8 M (cid:50) 1 ( Fab (cid:57) ) . Stock solutions of labeled antibody in PBS ( (cid:39) 3 mg (cid:121) ml ) were diluted to the desired concentration ( 100 – 3000 (cid:109) g (cid:121) ml ) in sterile saline containing 1 mg (cid:121) ml BSA . Higher concentrations of intact mAb ( 3000 – 30 , 000 (cid:109) g (cid:121) ml ) were obtained by mixing the labeled material with unlabeled molecules ( (cid:39) 30 mg (cid:121) ml ) . The free diffusion coefficient ( D 0 ) of each molecule was determined by performing FRAP measurements on 0 . 1 - mm - thick glass capillary tubes containing 0 . 1 mg (cid:121) ml fluorescein - conjugated protein . Animal Model . A transparent window chamber allowed noninvasive microscopic observation of human tumor xeno - graft tissue in athymic nude mice . The xenografts were derived from the LS174T colon carcinoma cell line shown to express CEA in vitro ( 18 ) and in vivo ( 19 – 21 ) . Immunohistochemical analysis of xenograft tissue sections confirmed that CEA expression was dense and uniform ( data not shown ) . As described previously ( 19 ) , a portion of folded skin was replaced with a glass coverslip to expose the striated muscle and subcutaneous tissue of the opposing skin layer , upon which a suspension of cultured cells ( 2 (cid:51) 10 5 in 2 (cid:109) l ) was deposited . When the solid tumor xenograft reached an approximate diameter of 4 mm ( 15 – 17 days after cell implantation ) , fluo - rescently labeled protein ( 20 – 6000 (cid:109) g in 0 . 2 ml of sterile saline solution ) was administered by tail vein injection , and the filling of the vasculature within the dorsal chamber was observed by fluorescence microscopy ( see Fig . 1 A ) . For the highest dose level , an additional 0 . 1 ml of ligand solution was injected after a 30 - min interval . At each dose level , measurements were performed on three mice . All procedures were performed in accordance with Massachusetts General Hospital guidelines for research animal care . Fluorescence Photobleaching Data Acquisition . FRAP measurements of interstitial mobility were performed 24 h after i . v . administration of various doses of fluorescently labeled mAb . The 24 - h timepoint was selected on the basis of previous studies ( 22 , 23 ) to allow sufficient accumulation and establishment of a quasi - equilibrium between bound and free The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

An argon ion laser ( model 2020 ; Spectra - Physics ) , tuned to a wavelength of 488 nm , was focused onto the tissue through the microscope objective ( (cid:51) 20 , NA 0 . 4 ) to form a circular spot with nominal diameter of 40 (cid:109) m and incident power of 30 mW . After a brief ( 100 - ms ) exposure to laser illumination , wide - field epifluores - cence images were projected onto an intensified charge - coupled device camera ( model 2400 ; Hamamatsu Photonics , Hamamatsu City , Japan ) , digitized , and stored at a rate of 5 image (cid:121) s for a period of 100 s . Photobleaching recoveries were quantified by spatial Fourier analysis ( 24 , 25 ) inwhicheachsequentialimageissubtractedfrom a prebleach image and multiplied by a windowing function , as described ( 26 ) , to obtain an array f ( x , y , t ) , where t is the time after laser exposure ( s ) , and x and y are the spatial coordinates ( (cid:109) m ) . Each array describing the time - dependent photobleached pattern is then converted by two - dimensional discrete Fourier transform ( 27 ) into the spatial frequency domain F ( u , v , t ) , where u and v are coordinates of a two - dimensional spatial frequency vector ( cm (cid:50) 1 ) . For the purposes of this study , in which diffusion is assumed to be isotropic , the spatial frequency magnitude ( q , in radian (cid:121) cm ) was defined as q 2 (cid:53) 4 (cid:112) 2 ( u 2 (cid:49) v 2 ) . The transformation of individual images is illustrated in Fig . 2 . Direct Mobility and Affinity Calculation from FRAP Data . The dissipation of an arbitrary photobleached pattern is driven by interstitial diffusion , characterized by the effective intersti - tial diffusion coefficient D eff ( cm 2 (cid:122) s (cid:50) 1 ) and by a characteristic diffusion distance . In the Fourier transform domain , the diffusion length is defined by the spatial frequency of each Fourier component . Each periodic spatial frequency compo - nent relaxes at a rate q 2 D eff ( s (cid:50) 1 ) that is independent of other components and unaffected by distortion due to the optical transfer function of the microscope (cid:121) imaging system ( 25 ) . Binding , which acts to preserve the photobleached pattern , is characterized by the effective forward and reverse binding rates k f ( s (cid:50) 1 ) and k r ( s (cid:50) 1 ) . The forward rate k f is actually a pseudo - first - order rate that is the product of intrinsic associ - ation rate k f (cid:57) ( M (cid:50) 1 (cid:122) s (cid:50) 1 ) and concentration of free receptors B ( M ) ; therefore this effective rate will vary with ligand con - centration . The measured fluorescence pattern , F ( u , v , t ) ( con - sisting of a free and bound fraction , F free and F bound ) is assumed to obey a simple first - order reaction - diffusion relation in which only the free fraction diffuses . The relation is given by the following set of ordinary differential equations : dF free dt (cid:53) (cid:50) (cid:126) q 2 D eff (cid:49) k f (cid:33) F free (cid:49) k r F bound . [ 1 ] dF bound dt (cid:53) k f F free (cid:50) k r F bound . [ 2 ] The assumptions that a chemical quasi - equilibrium exists and that free and bound molecules are photo bleached at the same rate provide the following initial condition : dF dt (cid:85) t (cid:53) 0 (cid:53) q 2 D eff k r k f (cid:49) k r F (cid:126) u , v , 0 (cid:33) . [ 3 ] The exact solution to the coupled differential equations is a biexponential decay , for which the eigenvalues are : (cid:108) (cid:53) (cid:50) (cid:126) q 2 D eff (cid:49) k f (cid:49) k r (cid:33) 2 (cid:51) (cid:83) 1 (cid:54) (cid:206) 1 (cid:50) 4 q 2 D eff k r (cid:126) q 2 D eff (cid:49) k f (cid:49) k r (cid:33) 2 (cid:68) . [ 4 ] To reduce the number of curve - fitting parameters , we derived simplified forms appropriate to the observed recovery data . A dimensionless time variable , (cid:116) (cid:53) q 2 D 0 t , was defined based on the diffusion rate in water . Whenever possible , the two binding rates were combined into a single equilibrium affinity , K app (cid:53) k f (cid:121) k r , or were expressed as an immobile fraction (cid:102) , defined by the simple algebraic identity (cid:102) (cid:53) K app (cid:121) ( 1 (cid:49) K app ) . A ‘‘low - affinity , ’’ ‘‘reaction - limited’’ simplification is valid when the association and dissociation rates are of similar magnitude and both much slower than the diffusion rate ( q 2 D eff (cid:46)(cid:46) k f (cid:39) k r ) , meaning that a significant portion of molecules is unbound and that dissociated molecules are likely to diffuse long distances before rebinding . F (cid:126) u , v , t (cid:33) F (cid:126) u , v , 0 (cid:33) (cid:60) (cid:126) 1 (cid:50) (cid:102) (cid:33) exp (cid:83) (cid:50) D eff D 0 (cid:116) (cid:68) (cid:49) (cid:102) . [ 5 ] Eq . 5 was used to analyze the photobleaching recoveries of all nonspecific control molecules to calculate D eff and (cid:102) for each molecule . Under ‘‘high affinity’’ conditions ( k f (cid:46)(cid:46) k r ) most molecules are bound , and the mobile fraction in Eq . 5 is undetectable . The recovery is described by : F (cid:126) u , v , t (cid:33) F (cid:126) u , v , 0 (cid:33) (cid:60) exp (cid:83) (cid:50) q 2 D eff k r q 2 D eff (cid:49) k f t (cid:68) . [ 6 ] Interpretation of the FRAP recovery rate under high affinity conditions depends on the relative magnitudes of the diffusion rate and the binding rate ( i . e . , how far unbound molecules travel before rebinding ) . Because typical dissociation rates for receptor – ligand binding vary over many orders of magnitude ( 28 ) , both reaction - limited and diffusion - limited models were considered . In the reaction - limited case , rebinding is rare ( q 2 D eff (cid:46)(cid:46) k f ) , and the recovery rate is simply the dissociation rate k r . But in the diffusion - limited case , rebinding is common ( k f (cid:46)(cid:46) q 2 D eff ) , and the recovery rate depends on the apparent equilibrium affinity K app : F (cid:126) u , v , t (cid:33) F (cid:126) u , v , 0 (cid:33) (cid:60) exp (cid:83) (cid:50) D eff K app D 0 (cid:116) (cid:68) . [ 7 ] For FRAP experiments involving specific ligand , the recovery rate k obs ( s (cid:50) 1 ) was compared with that of the control ligand ( from which a mean value of D eff was obtained with Eq . 5 ) . Eq . 7 was then used to calculate the apparent affinity by K app (cid:53) q 2 D eff (cid:121) k obs . In the reaction limit , ( k obs (cid:53) k r ) , by virtue of the reaction - limit condition ( k f (cid:44)(cid:44) q 2 D eff ) this calculated apparent affinity value is only the upper limit ( K app (cid:44) q 2 D eff (cid:121) k obs ) . Therefore Eq . 7 provides at least an upper limit estimate of the in vivo affinity . Use of Pharmacokinetic Model to Interpret FRAP Mea - surements of Apparent Affinity . FRAP measurements yield a direct measure of apparent affinity ( K app ) , the product of intrinsic affinity and local ligand concentration . Noninvasive measurement of local ligand concentration in tumor interstitial fluid is problematic ; therefore , to extract the intrinsic affinity we applied a simple two - compartment pharmacokinetic model ( 3 ) to estimate the interstitial fluid concentration based on the total dose injected into the tail vein . The extravasation rate of fluorescent ligand is assumed proportional to the plasma - interstitial fluid concentration difference . (cid:173) C total (cid:173) t (cid:53) PS (cid:64) C plasma (cid:126) t (cid:33) (cid:50) C free (cid:35) , [ 8 ] where C total , the interstitial ligand concentration , is the sum of free and bound ( specific and nonspecific ) components with respect to interstitial fluid volume ( taken to be 20 % of the total tumor volume ) . The vascular permeability surface area prod - uct per unit tissue volume , PS , has been measured in this xenograft model [ 2 . 5 (cid:51) 10 (cid:50) 3 (cid:122) min (cid:50) 1 for IgG , 5 . 1 (cid:51) 10 (cid:50) 3 (cid:122) min (cid:50) 1 1786 Biophysics : Berk et al . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 94 ( 1997 ) for Fab (cid:57) ( 29 ) ] . The initial plasma concentration was calculated from the injected dose divided by a 1 . 0 ml plasma volume , and the plasma clearance kinetics , C plasma ( t ) , of the injected agents in nude mice have been measured previously ( 22 ) . The accu - mulation of labeled ligand was calculated by numerical inte - gration of the extravasation rate over 24 h . A chemical quasi - equilibrium was assumed to exist among free and bound states in the tumor compartment , including nonspecific non - saturable binding affinity , K ns ( measured in control experi - ments ) , and specific saturable binding . K app , the ratio of all bound species to free ligand , was calculated as a function of the parameters K a ( intrinsic receptor - ligand association constant , M (cid:50) 1 ) and B max ( receptor density , M ) : K app (cid:53) C nonspecific (cid:49) C specific C free (cid:53) K ns (cid:49) K a B max 1 (cid:49) K a C free . [ 9 ] For comparison with other measurements of CEA content in the literature , the tissue receptor content ( nmol (cid:121) g ) was cal - culated as the product of interstitial receptor density B max and interstitial volume fraction ( assumed to be 0 . 2 ml (cid:121) g ) . To obtain the mean binding sites per cell , a 70 % cellular volume fraction and a mean single - cell volume of 1000 ( (cid:54) 500 ) (cid:109) m 3 were assumed . Volume fraction and cell size estimates were made based on histological examination of fixed tissue sections . RESULTS Extravasation and accumulation within the xenograft was evident for each putative ligand studied . Fig . 1 illustrates the initial appearance of fluorescently labeled material in the vascular component of the tumor , followed by fluorescent staining of the extravascular compartment over the next 24 h . At the lowest doses administered ( 0 . 13 nmol for IgG ) , accu - mulation of nonspecific antibody could not be detected , whereas a measurable increase of tissue fluorescence was observed after administering the same dose of specific mAb . At larger doses , there was no obvious difference in the images of the fluorescently stained xenograft tissue , and hence no way to judge the extent of binding based simply on appearance . Comparison of photobleached spot images provides quali - tative evidence for tumor - specific binding ( Fig . 2 A and B , and C and D ) . In the presence of control mAb , the nearly complete rapid dissipation of the photobleached spot indicates a high level of molecular mobility . In contrast , the photobleached pattern remained almost static in the presence of specific mAb , revealing the immobilization of mAb due to binding . Fig . 2 E and F illustrates the quantification of the photobleached pattern in terms of spatial frequency . Representative plots of the pattern decay under various conditions ( Fig . 3 ) further illustrate the difference between nonspecific and specific molecules . FRAP measurements made upon the control S1 molecule or its fragment were all fit to Eq . 5 to determine the effective interstitial diffusion coefficients and nonspecific binding affinity of IgG and Fab (cid:57) , as summarized in Table 1 . For the control molecules , both the immobile fraction ( shown in Fig . 4 A ) and the initial recovery rate ( hence D eff ) were dose - independent , in support of the hypothesis that the re - covery is a reaction - limited process with first - order nonsat - urable binding . FRAP measurements performed on CEA - specific mole - cules produced clear evidence of saturable high affinity bind - ing . As Fig . 3 B – D illustrates , the relative persistence of the pattern depended on the dose . At high doses , the initial decay rates were comparable to those exhibited by control molecules , and hence these decays were fitted also to the low affinity model , Eq . 5 . However , in the absence of a detectable initial rapid recovery phase ( as in Fig . 3 B ) , binding affinity was estimated by comparing the diminished decay rate with the mean decay rate of the equivalent nonspecific molecule using Eq . 7 . Fig . 4 shows the construction of binding isotherms based on these data . The relation between bound fraction and total dose ( Fig . 4 A ) shows the saturation phenomenon clearly . Below a critical dose nearly all of the specific ZCE025 mAb was bound ; above that dose , the bound fraction declined toward the nonspecific level . In contrast to its intact form , the monovalent ZCE025 Fab (cid:57) fragment exhibited a reduced mo - bility relative to the control Fab (cid:57) ( Fig . 4 A ) , even at the highest doses we were able to administer ( 1500 (cid:109) g ) . To estimate the intrinsic binding parameters responsible for the observed binding isotherms , the data were compared with F IG . 1 . Extravasation of fluorescein - labeled protein ( nonspecific IgG ) in a tumor xenograft is observed through a window in the mouse dorsal skin . ( A ) Ten minutes after injection , IgG is largely confined to the vascular space . ( B ) After 24 h , the fluorescence emission of the interstitial space exceeds that of the vasculature due to free and bound protein in the interstitial compartment . Although the image in B suggests a substantial level of nonspecific binding , the image does not accurately quantify the vascular - interstitial concentration difference because of differences in optical properties : the interstitium exhibits increased intensity due to scattered out - of - focus fluorescence above and below the plane of focus , whereas the red blood cells strongly absorb fluorescence in the vascular space .

Photobleached patterns are shown for xenograft tissue containing control S1 mAb ( A and B ) and CEA - specific ZCE025 ( C and D ) at times of 1 s ( A and C ) and 100 s ( B and D ) after laser exposure . Spatial detail of the pattern is quantified by two - dimensional Fourier trans - form of the images ( E and F ) . An image is converted into a two - dimensional array of Fourier coefficients , each element with its own spatial frequency vector ( u , v ) . The pattern is characterized by the plot of Fourier coefficient amplitude versus the spatial frequency magni - tude q , where q 2 (cid:53) 4 (cid:112) 2 ( u 2 (cid:49) v 2 ) , at t (cid:53) 1 s ( E ) and 100 s ( (cid:109) ) . Specific mAb ( F ) shows a greater persistence compared with the equivalent nonspecific molecule ( E ) . Biophysics : Berk et al . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 94 ( 1997 ) 1787 predictions of a simple pharmacokinetic model that estimates the local ligand concentration based on the injected dose and the independently measured extravasation ( 29 ) and plasma clearance rates ( 22 ) . The fit of the model to the data ( Fig . 4 A ) indicates a high level of CEA expression in this tumor xeno - graft , (cid:39) 0 . 56 nmol (cid:121) g of tissue or 5 . 0 ( (cid:54) 2 . 5 ) (cid:51) 10 5 binding sites (cid:121) cell , based on the assumptions listed above . This esti - mated antigen ( receptor ) density is approximately directly proportional to the assumed vascular permeability surface area parameter . Therefore , if the permeability were assumed to be a smaller by a factor of two ( which is within the error of that measurement ) , the estimated receptor density would be half the value given above ( e . g . , 0 . 28 nmol (cid:121) g ) . The reduced recovery rates observed for the specific mol - ecules compared with the related control molecule were interpreted using Eq . 7 as described above . The upper limit of apparent affinity K app is the ratio of recovery rates of the nonspecific control molecule ( q 2 D eff ) and the specific molecule ( k obs ) . Affinity values of up to 1000 were estimated ; as shown in Fig . 4 B , the median affinity at doses below 4 nmol was (cid:39) 100 , without a strong dose dependence . If K app is taken to be the product of intrinsic association constant and the binding site concentration ( adjusted for the interstitial fluid volume frac - tion as described in the methods ) , an upper limit of K a (cid:35) 4 (cid:51) 10 7 M (cid:50) 1 is calculated based on the median measurements for both the intact mAb and its fragment . If intrinsic affinity is calculated based on a more conservative estimate of tissue receptor content ( B max (cid:53) 0 . 28 nmol (cid:121) g ) and based on the highest measurements of apparent affinity ( the 90th percentile for K app at low doses of intact IgG is 510 ) then the K a value is (cid:39) 4 (cid:51) 10 8 M (cid:50) 1 , still well below the in vitro value ( 6 (cid:51) 10 9 M (cid:50) 1 ) . A comparison of Fab (cid:57) and intact IgG revealed no substantial difference in the maximum detected affinity , but a continued high Fab (cid:57) affinity at high doses . The pharmacokinetic model reveals that the higher apparent affinity of Fab (cid:57) compared with the intact ZCE025 at high doses results not from a greater number of available binding sites but from the use of total injected dose in plotting the binding isotherm rather than the free ligand concentration in interstitial fluid ( C free ) . As has been noted in other studies ( 30 , 31 ) , the shorter plasma residence time of Fab (cid:57) compared with intact IgG means that a smaller fraction of the injected dose is delivered to the interstitial fluid over a 24 - h period .

Quantification of photobleaching recovery rate in tumor tissue .

In vivo binding isotherms . ( A ) Bound fractions of nonspe - cific S1 IgG ( (cid:77) ) and S1 Fab (cid:57) ( E ) were independent of the total injected dose ( mean values indicated by thin solid and dotted lines , respec - tively ) . Intact ZCE025 mAb ( (cid:109) ) exhibited near complete immobili - zation at low doses and binding site saturation above 2 . 5 nmol . ZCE025 Fab (cid:57) ( F ) exhibited a large bound fraction at all doses . Each data point represents the mean and standard deviation of at least 18 FRAP measurements in three xenografts . Theoretical binding curves are shown ( thick solid line , intact IgG ; dotted line , Fab (cid:57) ) for an in vivo CEA content of 0 . 56 nmol (cid:121) g , calculated as described in the text . To show the sensitivity to the model parameters , IgG binding curves are also shown for 2 - fold reduction ( lower dashed line ) and enhancement ( upper dashed line ) of binding site density ( 0 . 25 and 1 . 0 nmol (cid:121) g ) . ( B ) The apparent binding affinity of anti - CEA molecules is calculated using Eq . 7 , based on the observed initial rate of fluorescence recovery k obs and the diffusion coefficient of the nonspecific control molecule , D eff , taken from Table 1 . The K app value is the factor by which specific binding slows the photobleaching recovery ; values around 1 imply negligible specific binding . Median values for intact IgG ( (cid:109) ) and fragment ( E ) are plotted with error bars showing the 90th percentile values for K app . At low doses , K app should approach the product of the intrinsic association constant K a and the binding site concentration B max . 1788 Biophysics : Berk et al . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 94 ( 1997 ) DISCUSSION The FRAP experiments described here measured transport over distances on the scale of 10 – 100 (cid:109) m within a tissue volume on the order of 0 . 1 nl . Experiments conducted upon more controlled in vitro preparations such as single cells or receptor - coated artificial surfaces may be more appropriate for elucidating the biophysics of receptor – ligand binding , but the attraction of the present method is its ability to reveal the effective binding behavior of tissue , capturing complexities that are not reproduced in model systems . Not only is receptor density likely to vary depending on the microenvironment , but the presentation and accessibility of receptors may also be modulated by effects on cell metabolism or by indirect effects of the extracellular matrix . The in vivo method reveals binding parameters relevant to tissue function such as the accessible receptor concentration , effective binding affinity , and the interstitial diffusion rate , and may be particularly useful for studies of physiology or drug delivery . In conventional phar - macokinetic studies , tissue binding parameters are among the many parameters that can be obtained by fitting the time - dependent ligand biodistribution to a model . This FRAP method provides an independent assessment of the compart - mentalization between bound and free ligand within a tissue . The high spatial resolution of the method suggests that it will be feasible to assess microscopic variations in binding affinity and relate those differences to the local structure and com - position of the tissue . Binding isotherms were generated by performing FRAP measurements of effective binding affinity for a range of doses at a particular timepoint after injection . A Scatchard or similar solid - phase binding analysis can be applied to the measured binding curve to determine the true association constant ( K a , in units of M (cid:50) 1 ) and antigen concentration . In practice such analysis is problematic because the tumor tissue is not a well mixed medium . Antibody extravasation and antigen density in a solid tumor are spatially heterogeneous , and there is likely a gradient in the local binding site occupancy such that regions of tissue near sites of extravasation become saturated at a lower dose than the more distant regions ( 32 , 33 ) . An addi - tional source of variation is the possible presence of shed antigen in the tumor interstitial fluid . ( A complex of antibody and soluble antigen would appear unbound to the FRAP method . ) Nevertheless , estimates of these basic binding pa - rameters were made by comparing the measurements with predictions of a simple pharmacokinetic model . This approach allowed calculation of the CEA expression in this tumor xenograft ; the estimate of 0 . 56 nmol (cid:121) g of tissue ( 101 (cid:109) g (cid:121) g ) corresponds very closely to the mean CEA content of 105 (cid:109) g (cid:121) g measured by Esteban et al . ( 20 ) , using the same experimental system ( LS174T xenograft grown subcutaneously in nude mice to a size of (cid:39) 5 mm diameter ) . It is notable that the in vivo CEA expression per cell ( based on our estimate of mean cell size ) is 5 . 0 (cid:51) 10 5 sites (cid:121) cell , markedly less than levels of over 10 6 (cid:121) cell measured in vitro ( 18 ) . Fluorescence recoveries observed at low doses of each specific molecule generally occurred at detectable rates indi - cating that the in vivo intrinsic association constant , K a , is no greater than 4 (cid:51) 10 7 M (cid:50) 1 , an order of magnitude lower than measured in vitro for Fab (cid:57) and two orders of magnitude lower than for IgG ( 30 ) . This reduced in vivo affinity may be attributable to factors discussed above ( presence of shed antigen , differences in antigen presentation , and spatial het - erogeneity of delivery ) . It is unlikely to be an artifact of the fluorescein conjugation required for the FRAP technique , because the in vitro competitive binding measurements men - tioned previously detected at most a minor reduction ( (cid:44) 20 % ) in the binding affinity of both the antibody and its Fab (cid:57) fragment . Previous in vitro FRAP measurements ( 12 ) suggest fluorescein conjugation either abolishes specific binding en - tirely or has minimal effect on affinity . The failure to detect a higher intrinsic binding avidity for intact IgG ( due to bivalent binding ) compared with its mono - valent fragment suggests that IgG binding is primarily mono - valent in this system . Moreover , the pharmacokinetic simula - tion of the IgG and Fab (cid:57) binding isotherms gave a better fit to the data when monovalent binding was assumed ( same recep - tor density for each molecule ) . The greatest potential source of error lies in the determi - nation of the local free ligand concentration . Unfortunately , in most tissue preparations , this value cannot be calculated directly from fluorescence intensity , but it could be deter - mined either by direct collection of interstitial fluid ( 34 ) or by an analysis of fluorescence partitioning in an excised tumor ( 35 ) . Both methods are problematic , particularly in terms of invasiveness , but could provide useful additional information such as the concentration of soluble receptor – ligand complex . The results of the specific binding measurements demon - strate the feasibility of in vivo detection and quantification of binding at the microscopic level . This experimental method provides a valuable tool to examine , within living tissue , a wide range of physiological phenomena involving receptor – ligand binding .
