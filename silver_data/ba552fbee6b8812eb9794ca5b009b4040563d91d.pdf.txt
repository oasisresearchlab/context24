It was the first identified gene in the solute carrier 6 ( SLC6 ) gene family ( Guastella et al . , 1990 ) , which also includes trans - porters for dopamine , serotonin , norepinephrine , and glycine . This family is characterized by an absolute re - quirement for Na + cotransport , which provides part of the driving force to accumulate neurotransmitter against an otherwise unfavorable concentration gradi - ent . Transporters in this family also exhibit a variable and incompletely understood necessity for Cl  cotransport Correspondence to Henry A .

In the healthy brain , density and surface / cytoplasm distribution of GAT1 transporters are tightly regulated . Previously , we determined that presynaptic boutons and axons have GAT1 molecules at a surface density of 800 – 1 , 300 µm  2 , with 61 – 63 % of these molecules expressed on the plasma membrane ( Chiu et al . , 2002 ) . This pool of transporters cycles to and from the plasma mem - brane , a process that plays a critical role in shaping neuro - transmission and is both constitutively and functionally regulated ( Whitworth and Quick , 2001 ; Zahniser and Doolen , 2001 ; Deken et al . , 2003 ; Loder and Melikian , 2003 ; McHugh et al . , 2004 ; Holton et al . , 2005 ; Wang and Quick , 2005 ; Quick , 2006 ; Boudanova et al . , 2008 ) . Although SLC6 transporters do function to some ex - tent when expressed as monomers ( Scholze et al . , 2002 ; GABA transporter function , oligomerization state , and anchoring : correlates with subcellularly resolved FRET Fraser J .

Oligomerization and subsequent trafficking of mGAT1 were studied in several subcellular regions of live cells using localized fluorescence , acceptor photobleach Förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) , and pixel - by - pixel analysis of normalized FRET ( NFRET ) images . Nine constructs were functionally indistinguishable from wild - type mGAT1 and provided information about normal mGAT1 assembly and trafficking . The remainder had compromised [ 3 H ] GABA uptake due to observable oligomerization and / or trafficking deficits ; the data help to determine regions of mGAT1 sequence involved in these processes . Acceptor photobleach FRET detected mGAT1 oligomerization , but richer information was obtained from analyzing the distribution of all - pixel NFRET ampli - tudes . We also analyzed such distributions restricted to cellular subregions . Distributions were fit to either two or three Gaussian components . Two of the components , present for all mGAT1 constructs that oligomerized , may represent dimers and high - order oligomers ( probably tetramers ) , respectively . Only wild - type functioning con - structs displayed three components ; the additional component apparently had the highest mean NFRET ampli - tude . Near the cell periphery , wild - type functioning constructs displayed the highest NFRET . In this subregion , the highest NFRET component represented  30 % of all pixels , similar to the percentage of mGAT1 from the acutely recycling pool resident in the plasma membrane in the basal state . Blocking the mGAT1 C terminus postsynaptic density 95 / discs large / zona occludens 1 ( PDZ ) - interacting domain abolished the highest amplitude component from the NFRET distributions . Disrupting the actin cytoskeleton in cells expressing wild - type functioning trans - porters moved the highest amplitude component from the cell periphery to perinuclear regions . Thus , pixel - by - pixel NFRET analysis resolved three distinct forms of GAT1 : dimers , high - order oligomers , and transporters associated via PDZ - mediated interactions with the actin cytoskeleton and / or with the exocyst . © 2009 Moss et al .

Moreover , we find that the ra - tio of the FRET between peripheral and perinuclear subcellular compartments correlates with each construct’s function . Furthermore , the all - pixel FRET amplitude distributions have up to three components with low , in - termediate , and high mean amplitudes ; these correspond to mGAT1 dimers , higher - order oligomers , and mGAT1 PDZ - interaction domain – mediated events in specific sub - cellular compartments , respectively .

The ECFP - GalT plasmid was obtained from Addgene ( plasmid 11937 ) ( Cole et al . , 1996 ) . Polyethyleneimine ( PEI ) 50 % solution in H 2 O , GABA , latrunculin B , and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . Cell culture and transfections N2a cells were cultured as described previously ( Son et al . , 2009 ) . Cells were plated onto 12 - well plates , 60 - mm dishes , or 35 - mm culture dishes with 14 - mm glass bottoms that we precoated with 0 . 05 % PEI ( pH 8 . 4 in borate buffer ; 100 mM Na 2 B 4 O 7 , and 100 mM H 3 BO 3 ) .

Transfections were performed using a modification of the manufacturer’s Lipofectamine and PLUS reagent protocol to achieve expression levels of transporter that exceed neither the cells’ synthetic machinery nor trafficking mechanisms ( supple - mental Materials and methods and Table S1 ) . Latrunculin B incu - bations were performed as described previously ( Imoukhuede et al . , 2009 ) . Soragna et al . , 2005 ) , constitutive transporter oligomer - ization is a major factor in the release of newly synthe - sized transporter from the ER ( Scholze et al . , 2002 ; Sorkina et al . , 2003 ; Torres et al . , 2003 ; Bartholomäus et al . , 2008 ) . The crystal structure of the Aquifex aeolicus leucine transporter LeuT Aa ( a bacterial orthologue of the mammalian SLC6 neurotransmitter transporters ) reveals a dimer , with transmembrane domains ( TMs ) 9 and 12 probably providing the dimer interface ( Yamashita et al . , 2005 ) . There may also be higher - order oligomers ( Kilic and Rudnick , 2000 ; Hastrup et al . , 2003 ; Just et al . , 2004 ; Bartholomäus et al . , 2008 ) . Sequence elements in the cytoplasmic N and C ter - mini exert additional control over trafficking . They can serve as substrates for cytosolic regulators such as ki - nases or as motifs for interactions with other proteins , including postsynaptic density 95 / discs large / zona oc - cludens 1 ( PDZ ) domain – containing and soluble N - eth - ylmaleimide – sensitive fusion receptor proteins , which determine the insertion and withdrawal of transporter complexes from the cell surface ( Loder and Melikian , 2003 ; Torres et al . , 2003 ; Farhan et al . , 2004 ; McHugh et al . , 2004 ; Miranda et al . , 2004 ; Holton et al . , 2005 ; Quick , 2006 ; Boudanova et al . , 2008 ) . We wish to understand quantitative aspects of GAT1 in synaptic transmission . To facilitate this goal , one must study transporters that are expressed in appropriate cells at normal levels and at normal locations . Most previous studies involve expression in heterologous ex - pression systems in which the transporter is greatly over - expressed and / or has the potential to associate with incorrect partner proteins . Here , we describe the con - struction of 19 new fluorescent mouse GAT1 ( mGAT1 ) transporters tagged with either cyan or yellow fluores - cent proteins ( CFP and YFP , respectively ; XFP collec - tively ) . The majority of the designs are fusions of the XFP onto the mGAT1 C terminus with additional modi - fications to preserve wild - type trafficking and assembly . We report functional characterization of these con - structs with a quantitative [ 3 H ] GABA uptake assay in which neither protein expression levels nor substrate transport has reached maximum when the transporter is expressed in mouse neuroblastoma 2a ( N2a ) cells ( a neuron - like cell line ) ; we present this expression system as an optimal one for the characterization of transiently expressed neuronal transporters . The assay revealed that several of these fluorescent mGAT1 transporters were functionally identical to wild - type mGAT1 . We applied Förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) techniques to study the assembly of the fluorescent mGAT1s . We especially evaluated , by pixel - by - pixel analy - sis of sensitized emission FRET , the local oligomeriza - tion of each fluorescent transporter construct in various subcellular compartments of a living cell . We conclude that pixel - by - pixel analysis of FRET has the ability to dis - tinguish between subsurface and membrane - inserted Moss et al . 491 We compared the function of the wild - type mGAT1 with our original fluorescent construct , mGAT1 0 GFP ( previously called mGAT1 - GFP ) ( Chiu et al . , 2002 ) , when expressed in the mouse N2a or human HEK 293T cell lines . Previous data show that mGAT1 0 GFP has a major trafficking deficit in vivo ( Chiu et al . , 2002 ) because this construct design disrupts an endogenous PDZ - interacting epitope ( - AYI - CO 2  ) at the mGAT1 C terminus of mGAT1 ( Imoukhuede et al . , 2009 ) . The N2a cell line is both neu - ronal and murine in origin and may possess much of the neces - sary cellular machinery to process and traffic mGAT1 correctly ; HEK 293T cells are a model human line frequently used to assess the function of plasma membrane proteins . 0 , 50 , 100 , 250 , or 500 ng of wild - type mGAT1 plasmid or an equimolar amount of mGAT1 0 GFP or pcDNA3 . 1 ( + ) plasmid was transfected in 12 - well plates . 20 - min [ 3 H ] GABA uptake experiments were performed in both low ( 2 . 5 µM ) and high ( 80 µM ) extracellular GABA concen - trations ( [ GABA ] O ) . Details of the [ 3 H ] GABA uptake assay are in the supplemental material . [ 3 H ] GABA uptake in N2a cells transfected with wild - type mGAT1 remained in the linear range , with respect to cDNA trans - fected , at cDNA levels ≤100 ng cDNA / well in both 2 . 5 and 80 µM [ GABA ] O ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) . The measured [ 3 H ] GABA uptake ap - proached a limit for transfections ≥250 ng cDNA / well . Impor - tantly , compared with the wild - type mGAT1 control , the [ 3 H ] GABA uptake by N2a cells transfected with the mGAT1 0 GFP construct A linear [ 3 H ] GABA uptake assay in a neuronal cell line To evaluate the function of fluorescently modified mGAT1 con - structs relative to wild type , we sought to establish an uptake assay in an appropriate expression system that faithfully reports any functional changes caused by the introduction of the fluoro - phore . In gene transfer experiments , quantitative analysis of pro - tein function can be vitiated by several mechanisms that cause a “ceiling , ” “maximum , ” “limit , ” “plateau , ” “leveling off , ” or “satura - tion” of measured uptake . The nouns in quotes have recently con - noted various phenomena , but we use the verb “to exceed” for each specific effect that we sought to avoid . ( A ) The quantity of template cDNA transfected into the cell may exceed the capacity of the cell’s protein synthetic machinery . ( B ) The quantity of overexpressed protein may exceed the ca - pability of the cell’s posttranslational processing , sorting , or traf - ficking mechanisms . ( C ) The substrate concentration may lie outside a linear region of the dose – response relation . For transporters , Michaelis - Men - ten analyses describe a maximum transport velocity ( V max ) of the neurotransmitter transporter at substrate concentrations that substantially exceed the K m . ( D ) Net substrate flux may exceed the capacity of the cell’s ef - flux pumps , organelle pumps , or simple diffusional removal , leading to partial or complete equilibration . Figure 1 . Establishing a lin - early responding [ 3 H ] GABA uptake assay in an appropri - ate cell type . 50 , 100 , 250 , or 500 ng of wild - type mGAT1 plasmid or an equimolar amount of mGAT1 0 GFP or pcDNA3 . 1 ( + ) plasmid was transfected / well . 20 - min up - take assays were performed on transfected N2a cells in 2 . 5 µM ( A ) or 80 µM ( B ) [ GABA ] O .

Time course experi - ments were performed in 2 . 5 µM ( G ) or 80 µM ( H ) [ GABA ] O on N2a cells trans - fected with 100 ng / well of wild - type mGAT1 plasmid or an equimolar amount of the pcDNA3 . 1 ( + ) plasmid . Each data point represents the mean of six transfections ± SEM . 492 NFRET resolves GAT1 oligomerization state and anchoring Turbo C x Hotstart polymerase with 5  and 3  extensions corre - sponding to the 20 – 22 - nt regions that flanked the intended site of insertion , such that the PCR product integrated in - frame immedi - ately after the fluorophore sequence when used as the primers in a subsequent QuikChange II XL mutagenesis PCR reaction . For mGAT1XFP * , we simply added a GTC codon for Val after the fluoro - phore ORF . Fig . 2 displays the protein sequences of the modified regions of mGAT1 for each fluorescent construct . mGAT1 0 CFP and mGAT1 0 YFP repeated the fusion design of mGAT1 0 GFP but with the fluorophore exchanged as annotated . The three C - terminal residues of the mGAT 0 XFP fusions are - YKI - CO 2  , which com - prises a broadly defined consensus PDZ class II – interacting motif ( X -  - X -  , where  designates a hydrophobic residue and X any residue ) ( Sheng and Sala , 2001 ; Hung and Sheng , 2002 ) . We searched the Ensembl databases using Biomart ( http : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / biomart ) ( Spudich et al . , 2007 ) and applied the GO : 0005886 “plasma membrane” cellular component filter . The search identi - fied no known membrane proteins possessing the - YKI - CO 2  C - terminal sequence . In the mGAT1XFP * constructs , we defined the terminal residue P ( 0 ) more narrowly , changing the terminal isoleucine residue present in mGAT1 0 XFP to a valine in mGAT1XFP * ( Fig . 2 ) . The resulting C - terminal sequence , - YKV - CO 2  , reconstituted a functional PDZ class II – interacting motif present in Ephrin B receptors , a class that relies on interactions with the PDZ domain – containing proteins for clustering ( Torres et al . , 1998 ; Brückner et al . , 1999 ; Lin et al . , 1999 ; Madsen et al . , 2005 ) . Other constructs in the C - terminal XFP fusion series , mGAT1XFP3 , mGAT1XFP8 , mGAT1XFP20 , mGAT1XFP28 , and mGAT1XFP45 , had the most C - terminal 3 , 8 , 20 , 28 , or 45 residues of the hGAT1 appended after the mGAT1XFP fusion ( Fig . 2 ) . The differences in nucleotide sequence between the hGAT1 and mGAT1 C termini were a useful source of positive identification when we analyzed the clones during construction . PCR integration was applied to amplify and insert EYFP or ECFP directly between residues R565 and L566 , I570 and Q571 , or V577 and R578 of mGAT1 to generate the mGAT1 5xx XFP 5xx CT constructs ( Fig . 2 ) . The site of XFP insertion in GAT1 is high - lighted in the nomenclatures for these constructs by superscript residue numbers flanking the fluorophore , and the “CT” denotes that the insertion occurs within the C terminus . The EYFP or ECFP ORFs with 15 additional codons from the downstream MCS of pEYFP - C1 or pECFP - C1 vectors were ampli - fied and fused via PCR integration directly onto the 5  end of the mGAT1 ORF in pcDNA3 . 1 ( + ) to generate the XFP15mGAT1 N - terminally tagged constructs . Surface biotinylation Surface biotinylation experiments were performed as described previously ( Hu and Quick , 2008 ) . The details are in the supple - mental material . Confocal Imaging Transfections for confocal imaging were performed as described for uptake assays but scaled up appropriately according to Table S1 for transfections in 35 - mm culture dishes . Live cells grown on 14 - mm glass - bottom culture dishes ( MatTek ) precoated with 0 . 05 % PEI were washed once with room temperature Krebs - Ringer - HEPES buffer and observed in the same solution ( Ramamoorthy et al . , 1998 ) . Live cells were imaged at room temperature on an Eclipse C1si laser - scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 63× , 1 . 4 numerical aperture VC Plan Apo oil objective and a 32 - an - ode photomultiplier tube ( Nikon ) . Where required , images were linearly unmixed using the EZ - C1 software ( Nikon ) for the emis - sion spectra of the fluorophores of interest using reference spectra individually compiled for each fluorophore expressed in the same cell type and imaged under identical experimental conditions . was reduced ( by 28 – 65 % ) for all cDNA transfection amounts in both 2 . 5 and 80 µM [ GABA ] O , reproducing the functional deficit reported for synaptosome preparations from mGAT1 0 GFP knock - in mice ( Chiu et al . , 2002 ) . On the other hand , HEK 293T cells did not replicate this known functional deficit when expressing the mGAT1 0 GFP construct ; [ 3 H ] GABA uptake reached a limit in 2 . 5 µM [ GABA ] O in cells transfected with as little as 100 ng cDNA / well of wild - type mGAT1 plasmid ( V 100 ng = 83 . 5 ± 1 . 9 fmol / µg / min ; calculated maximum = 86 . 9 ± 2 . 4 fmol / µg / min ; Fig . 1 C ) . Furthermore , when the variable parameter was the mass of cDNA transfected in HEK 293T cells , the maximum calculated mGAT - 1 0 GFP [ 3 H ] GABA flux ( 93 . 5 ± 17 . 9 fmol / µg / min ) was not signifi - cantly different from wild - type mGAT1 ( Fig . 1 C ) . Why does the HEK 293T cell assay fail to replicate the func - tional deficit linked to the PDZ interaction ? We suspected that this failure occurs because the HEK 293T cell assay exceeds a limit associated with one of points A – D above . We tested the relative expression of total mGAT1 protein per cell in HEK 293T cells compared with N2a cells by measuring the absolute fluorescence intensity of mGAT1 0 GFP when expressed in each cell type . 250 ng mGAT1 0 GFP cDNA was transfected per 35 - mm dish of 3 . 5 × 10 5 cells ( equivalent per cell to 100 ng cDNA per 12 - well plate of 1 . 4 × 10 5 cells ; Table S1 ) . Images of complete cells ( 0 . 5 - µm step Z - stack ) were acquired 48 h after transfection . Integrated fluores - cence measurements determined that the volume density of mGAT1 0 GFP expressed in HEK 293T cells was 4 . 9 - fold greater than when expressed in N2a cells ( Fig . 1 , D – F ) . We concluded ( a ) that N2a cells are the more suitable cell type for our experi - ments and ( b ) that one should transfect 100 ng / well of wild - type mGAT1 plasmid or its equimolar amount per unit surface in other well sizes . In addition , under these transfection conditions , [ 3 H ] GABA uptake remained linear , with respect to the assay dura - tion , for ≤60 min in both 2 . 5 or 80 µM [ GABA ] O : linear regression analysis of the 3 - , 10 - , 20 - , and 60 - min data points revealed r 2 = 0 . 997 and 0 . 989 , respectively ( Fig . 1 , G and H ) . In summary , we believe that the assay conditions faithfully re - ported changes caused by the mutations that we studied . We be - lieve these conditions also rendered the optical measurements sensitive to such mutations . Design and cloning of fluorescent mGAT1 constructs We generated 19 new fluorescent mGAT1 constructs to study traf - ficking and oligomerization of the GAT1 transporter . The goal was to generate fluorescent mGAT1 proteins that ( a ) assembled and trafficked as wild type and ( b ) gave robust FRET efficiencies when the transporter oligomerized . Wild - type mGAT1 and mGAT1 0 GFP constructs have been described previously ( Chiu et al . , 2002 ) . The new fluorescent mGAT1 constructs described in this study were designed to rectify trafficking deficits of mGAT1 0 GFP ; in addition , we exchanged the GFP fluorophore for ECFP or EYFP containing the “monomeric” A206K mutation to avoid dis - tortions caused by dimerization motifs within the ECFP and EYFP proteins ( Zacharias et al . , 2002 ) and to facilitate the study of pro - tein – protein interactions by FRET . To generate the fluorescent mutants mGAT1 0 XFP and mGAT1XFP * through mGAT1XFP45 , the wild - type mGAT1 open reading frame ( ORF ) was subcloned without its original stop co - don into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of the pcDNA3 . 1 ( + ) expres - sion vector multiple cloning site ( MCS ) . XFP ORFs were then subcloned downstream from and in frame with the mGAT1 ORF at the NotI and XbaI sites of the pcDNA3 . 1 ( + ) MCS . This resulted in a 12 – amino acid spacer between the end of the mGAT1 se - quence and the beginning of the fluorophore . We modified a method for the integration of PCR fragments without the use of restriction enzymes ( Geiser et al . , 2001 ) to add the final 3 , 8 , 20 , 28 , or 45 codons of the human GAT1 ( hGAT1 ) ORF . These were amplified from a source plasmid using the proof - reading Pfu - Moss et al . 493 based on microscopic images ( Wallrabe and Periasamy , 2005 ; Jares - Erijman and Jovin , 2006 ) . First , in a specimen expressing both donor - and acceptor - tagged molecules , the existence of FRET causes a decrease in the donor intensity , proportional to the number of donor - tagged molecules that interact with accep - tor - tagged molecules . Thus , “acceptor photobleach” FRET directly measures E by quantifying the increase in the donor intensity after Quantification of images was performed using ImageJ software ver - sion 1 . 41 ( Abramoff et al . , 2004 ) . Colocalization calculations were performed using the Colocalization Finder plug - in for ImageJ . FRET FRET efficiency E is defined by the Förster equation ( Lakowicz , 2006a ) . Two classes of techniques provide approximate E values Figure 2 . Schematics of fluorescent mGAT1 construct designs and primary sequence alignments of the regions that are fused with XFP . In each schematic , the mGAT1 peptide is illustrated as a black bar , and TMs are marked as superimposed numbered boxes . TM12 is highlighted in magenta . Linkers deriving from cloning vector are shown in red , and the XFP moiety is shown as a cyan and yellow box . Additional hGAT1 sequence is shown as a dark blue box . # , a variable number of residues depending on the construct design . All sche - matics and their internal features are scaled according to sequence length . The three classes of florescent mGAT1 fusions , C - terminal additions , C - terminal fusions , and N - terminal additions are displayed with their names to the left . For the fusions of XFP to the mGAT1 C terminus , only the last 14 residues of the fluorophore and any appended hGAT1 or other sequence are displayed . For the mGAT1 C - terminal XFP insertions , the regions immediately adjacent to the insertion site and the first four and last four residues of the XFP are displayed . Displayed GAT1 C - terminal sequences are numbered with the terminal residue being P ( 0 ) ; upstream sequence positions are negative . Other important highlighted regions include : fluorophore sequence ( GFP in green ; XFP in light blue ) , the terminal hydro - phobic residues of mGAT1 0 GFP and mGAT1XFP * ( purple ) , the endogenous GAT1 class II PDZ – interacting motif - AYI ( dark green ) , mouse or hGAT1 TM12 sequence ( magenta ) , nonclassical endocytic motifs homologous to FREKLAYAIT in mDAT ( conserved residues underlined ) ( Holton et al . , 2005 ; Boudanova et al . , 2008 ) , RL or RI ER export motif ( bold ) ( Farhan et al . , 2007 ) , and VMI or VMV ( bold ) ER – Golgi intermediate compartment export motif ( Farhan et al . , 2008 ) .

Linker sequence between XFP and mGAT1 is shown in red . 494 NFRET resolves GAT1 oligomerization state and anchoring each region of interest ( ROI ) . Extreme outliers ( pixels with NFRET amplitudes greater than three times the interquartile range [ IQR ] ) and pixels within an ROI with an NFRET amplitude of 0 were eliminated from the calculations . All - pixel NFRET amp - litude distributions for a given collection of cells , or of subregions , were summarized as histograms with a bin size of 0 . 02 NFRET units . Distributions were best fit with two or three Gaussians . Fit - ting concluded when R 2 ≥ 0 . 99 . To calculate FRET efficiency from sensitized emission experi - ments , one needs to modify Eq . 1 because it is not possible to di - rectly measure I D from such samples . Because the sensitized emission of the acceptor is due to the quenching of the donor in the presence of the acceptor , I D can be substituted in Eq . 1 by add - ing the nF signal amplitude to the amplitude of the donor fluo - rescence in the presence of acceptor I DA ( Elangovan et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , we calculated FRET efficiency E as E I I nF DA DA = − +     1 .

R E S U LT S Several mGAT1 C - terminal fluorophore fusions display wild - type function and surface localization We studied the subcellular localization of the mGAT1 C - terminal fluorophore addition constructs by laser - scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy ( Fig . 3 ) and compared their function to nonfluorescent wild - type mGAT1 in [ 3 H ] GABA uptake assays ( Fig . 4 A ) . With the optimized [ 3 H ] GABA uptake assays described in Mate - rials and methods , the major source of variability was apparently unavoidable variations in cell growth . There - fore , where appropriate , we used side - by - side assays ( as in Figs . 4 A and 5 B ) ; in such assays , we believe that dif - ferences in substrate transport velocity of ≥25 % reflect real differences in the membrane levels of functional transporters . The mGAT1 0 XFP constructs display fluo - rescence throughout the cytoplasm ; at the periphery of the cells ( that is , in the region near large amounts of photobleach of the acceptor ( although artifacts including acceptor photoconversion and donor photobleach can distort this mea - surement ) ( Rizzo et al . , 2006 ) . Second , the acceptor displays sensitized emission during excitation of the donor . Measurements of such “sensitized FRET” or “sensitized emission FRET” preserve the fluorophores in the sample and require only a single spec - trally resolved image rather than a time series , but the acquired FRET index ( an indirect measure of E ) ( Elangovan et al . , 2003 ) responds nonlinearly to variations in the extent of interaction be - tween fluorophore - tagged molecules ( Gordon et al . , 1998 ) . This paper distinguishes between acceptor photobleach FRET and sensitized FRET measurements , as appropriate . Acceptor photobleach FRET Live N2a cells were visualized at room temperature in Krebs - Ringer - HEPES buffer 48 h after transfection using either an in - verted LSM 510 Meta laser - scanning confocal microscope equipped with an Achroplan IR 63× , 1 . 4 numerical aperture oil - immersion objective and the meta array of photomultiplier tubes ( Carl Zeiss , Inc . ) or the Eclipse C1si LSCM . Photobleaching was performed as described previously ( Son et al . , 2009 ) . FRET effi - ciency ( E ) was calculated : E I I DA D = −     1 ( 1 ) I DA represents the normalized fluorescence intensity of CFP ( 100 % ) in the presence of nonbleached acceptor . I D represents the normalized fluorescence intensity of CFP after 100 % photo - bleach of the acceptor , YFP . The I D value was extrapolated from a scatter plot of the percentage increase of CFP versus the percent - age decrease of YFP for each cell ( Nashmi et al . , 2003 ) . Quantification of pixel - by - pixel FRET from sensitized acceptor emission Live cells were imaged using the Eclipse C1si LSCM . Full emission spectra images were acquired in 5 - nm bins between 452 and 612 nm , linearly unmixed , and complied into donor spectral bleed - through stacks , acceptor spectral bleed - through stacks , and sam - ple image stacks as described previously ( Son et al . , 2009 ) . The Pix - FRET ImageJ plug - in was used to determine the CFP and YFP bleed - through values and to calculate the net FRET ( nF ) and nor - malized FRET ( NFRET ) in each pixel ( Feige et al . , 2005 ) . With the background and bleed - through corrections set , the nF for each pixel as described by Eq . 2 was calculated and the data out - put as 32 - bit images . nF I I BT I BT FRET CFP CFP YFP YFP = − × − × ( 2 ) nF was normalized for donor and acceptor expression levels ac - cording to Eq . 3 to calculate NFRET and to generate a 32 - bit NFRET image ( Xia and Liu , 2001 ) . NFRET I I BT I BT I I FRET CFP CFP YFP YFP CFP YFP = − × − × × ( 3 ) Normalizing nF to the square root of the product of the donor and acceptor fluorescence intensities controlled for large varia - tions in the expression levels of each fluorophore between differ - ent cells and provided a measure of FRET that is readily comparable between different samples ( Xia and Liu , 2001 ) . Gordon et al . ( 1998 ) explained that NFRET is a relative measure of the dissociation constant ( K d ) for the binding interaction be - tween proteins that increases monotonically ( but not linearly ) at smaller values of K d . Box plots were constructed showing the mean NFRET , the median NFRET , and the spread of the data for Moss et al . 495 poor function of these mGAT1 0 XFP constructs was ex - pected from the functional deficits of the knock - in mouse strain . Because the YFP - CFP FRET pair forms the basis of most measurements , we have not con - structed additional GFP - containing mGAT1 mutants . The constructs mGAT1XFP * , mGAT1XFP3 , mGAT1XFP8 , mGAT1XFP20 , and mGAT1XFP28 ex - hibited strong localization in the cell periphery ( Fig . 3 ) . We determined that a large part of this fluorescence dis - tribution arose from surface membrane expression . Three complementary assay types provide evidence of this point . ( 1 ) For each of these five constructs , [ 3 H ] GABA uptake from transfected N2a cells did not differ signifi - cantly from wild - type mGAT1 ( Fig . 4 A ) . ( 2 ) Surface biotinylation experiments determined that 38 – 44 % of the total expressed mGAT1XFP * , mGAT1XFP3 , mGAT1XFP8 , mGAT1XFP20 , or mGAT1XFP28 protein inserted into the plasma membrane , which again did not differ significantly from wild - type mGAT1 ( 43 % ; Fig . 4 B ) . ( 3 ) Concentration dependence of [ 3 H ] GABA uptake for mGAT1XFP * , mGAT1XFP8 , mGAT1YFP3 , and mGAT1YFP20 was , again , identical to wild - type mGAT1 ( Fig . 4 , C – E ) . Each panel of Fig . 4 ( C – E ) presents the plasma membrane ) , the fluorescence is brighter ( Fig . 3 ) . Fig . 4 A shows that this peripherally enhanced fluores - cence does not represent complete plasma membrane insertion of mGAT1 0 XFP constructs : [ 3 H ] GABA uptake of both mGAT1 0 YFP and mGAT1 0 CFP functioned less well ( 41 ± 1 and 60 ± 8 % , respectively ) compared with wild - type mGAT1 . This poor function was not revealed by our previous expression system in HEK 293T cells ( Chiu et al . , 2002 ) , but a functional deficiency was observed when neurons of mGAT1 0 GFP knock - in mice exhibited reduced [ 3 H ] GABA uptake compared with wild - type mice . We therefore believe that the present assay system has good relevance to several processes that control func - tional levels of mGAT1 expression in neurons . We include data for mGAT1 0 GFP for primarily histor - ical reasons . Its poor function in a knock - in mouse strain ( Chiu et al . , 2002 ) provided a major motivation for the present study . Surprisingly , the mGAT1 0 GFP functioned even less well ( 22 ± 2 % of wild type ) than the corresponding YFP and CFP constructs . We have not systematically explored the source of the differences among the functional data for the three fluorophore fusions ( YFP , CFP , and GFP ) , but as noted , the generally Figure 3 . Expression and subcellular localization of C - terminal XFP addition mGAT1 constructs in N2a cells . Each panel displays representative fluorescence micros - copy images of live N2a cells expressing each C - terminal addition construct 48 h after transfection using the linear range parameters described in Materials and methods . The nomenclature for each construct has been abbreviated to remove the “mGAT1” because this element is common to all the constructs displayed ( i . e . , mGAT1 0 GFP = 0 GFP and mGAT1YFP8 = YFP8 ) . Bars , 10 µm . 496 NFRET resolves GAT1 oligomerization state and anchoring tein sample aggregated in the well of the acrylamide gels and did not separate under electrophoresis . Appar - ently , the mGAT1XFP45 constructs suffer from one or more major deficits . Diminished mGAT1 function results if XFP is incorporated close to TM12 In the mGAT1 565 XFP 566 CT and mGAT1 570 XFP 571 CT constructs , the XFP insertion sites interrupted motifs that are important in the regulation of mGAT1 trafficking ( Holton et al . , 2005 ; Farhan et al . , 2007 , 2008 ; Boudanova et al . , 2008 ) . However , the C terminus region interrupted by our mGAT1 577 XFP 578 CT construct has little influence on mGAT1 oligomerization and trafficking , according to a previous report ( Farhan et al . , 2004 ) . Fig . 5 A displays the subcellular localization of the mGAT1 565 XFP 566 CT , mGAT1 570 XFP 571 CT , and mGAT1 577 XFP 578 CT constructs . concentration dependence data for two fluorescent constructs versus wild - type mGAT1 transfections per - formed in side - by - side assays . Within each set of experi - ments , the K m and V max for the fluorescently tagged transporters did not differ significantly from those of wild - type mGAT1 . On the other hand , mGAT1XFP45 constructs were expressed primarily inside the cell ( Fig . 3 ) . This point is reported by markedly impaired [ 3 H ] GABA uptake com - pared with wild - type mGAT1 ( mGAT1CFP45 , 21 ± 2 % ; mGAT1YFP45 , 22 ± 2 % ; Fig . 4 A ) and by the very small fraction of the total mGAT1XFP45 protein that parti - tioned into the plasma membrane in biotinylation as - says ( 2 . 8 ± 0 . 6 % compared with 44 ± 5 % for wild type ; Fig . 4 B ) . It should be noted that mGAT1XFP45 was particularly challenging to process during surface bio - tinylation experiments because the majority of the pro - Figure 4 .

The nonspecific uptake was determined from wells transfected with empty pcDNA3 . 1 ( + ) vector and subtracted from the test samples , but is displayed for reference in each plot . No significant difference was found between any of these fluorescent mGAT1 con - structs and wild - type mGAT1 for all concentra - tions , as determined by one - way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test ( P ≤ 0 . 05 ) . Data represent the mean uptake for each concentration ± SEM for six to nine transfections . Moss et al . 497 C - terminal YFP insertions ( Fig . 5 B ) . mGAT1 565 YFP 566 CT exhibited a marked deficit in uptake compared with wild - type mGAT1 . Uptake from N2a cells expressing mGAT1 570 YFP 571 CT was intermediate between mGAT1 565 YFP 566 CT and wild - type mGAT1 . Uptake from mGAT1 577 YFP 578 CT - expressing cells did not differ significantly from wild - type mGAT1 . In concentration – response experiments , the K m for mGAT1 577 YFP 578 CT also did not differ sig - nificantly from wild - type mGAT1 , and its V max was 78 % that of wild type ( Fig . 5 C ) . Thus , the presence of the XFP fluorophores between the C - terminal R565 and Q571 residues inhibited interactions required for nor - mal trafficking of mGAT1 to the plasma membrane . Locating the XFP six residues more distally in the C terminus avoided such inhibitions and maintained These three construct designs expressed varying degrees of concentrated fluorescence at the periphery of the cells close to the plasma membrane as well as in intracel - lular compartments . The intracellular localization was greatest in the mGAT1 565 XFP 566 CT constructs , and in many instances , expression was confined entirely to in - tracellular compartments . This observation is exempli - fied by the mGAT1 565 YFP 566 CT image presented in Fig . 5 A ( 21 of out of 79 cells imaged ) . Notably , all cells expressing mGAT1 570 XFP 571 CT or mGAT1 577 XFP 578 CT constructs exhibited some apparent plasma membrane localization , with mGAT1 577 XFP 578 CT showing strong fluorescence concentrated in the cell periphery ( Fig . 5 A ) , similar to that observed for mGAT1XFP3 - mGAT1XFP28 . We studied the [ 3 H ] GABA uptake properties of the Figure 5 . Expression and functional characterization of C - terminal insertion mGAT1XFPCT constructs . ( A ) Each panel displays exemplar fluorescence microscopy images of live N2a cells expressing each of the C - terminal insertion constructs 48 h after transfection . Note that the subcel - lular distributions of mGAT1 565 CFP 566 CT and mGAT1 565 YFP 566 CT differ in the dis - played panels . These variations are not caused by the different fluorophores but are displayed to exemplify each of the two types of subcellular distributions observed for this construct design . Bars , 10 µm .

To quantify acceptor photo - bleach FRET between the mGAT1 oligomers , we constructed a scatter plot of the photobleach - induced changes in CFP and YFP fluorescence of each cell dur - ing the entire bleaching time , fitted a regression line to the data , and extrapolated to complete YFP photo - bleach ( Fig . 6 C ) . The extrapolated values of CFP pho - torecovery for the mGAT1CFP * - mGAT1YFP * and the mGAT1CFP8 - mGAT1YFP8 transfection pairs were 1 . 10 ± 0 . 01 and 1 . 26 ± 0 . 01 , respectively ( Fig . 6 C ) . Eq . 1 yields calculated FRET efficiencies of 9 % for mGAT1CFP8 / mGAT1YFP8 and 21 % for mGAT1CFP * / mGAT1YFP * . For the C - terminal mGAT1XFP45 fusions , which have poor function , we detected no measurable FRET be - tween mGAT1CFP45 - mGAT1YFP45 coexpressed in N2a cells ( Fig . 6 D ) . Likewise , no detectable acceptor photo - bleach FRET signal was recorded from cells coexpressing the CFP15mGAT1 - YFP15mGAT1 constructs ( Fig . 6 E ) . Pixel - based FRET reveals several components to the total FRET signal amplitude distribution The acceptor photobleach FRET data gave a reasonable report of the average FRET signal from confocal images of whole N2a cells expressing fluorescent GAT1 pro - tomers . However , acceptor photobleaching is not opti - mal for measurement of FRET at subcellular resolution in live cells . Attempting acceptor photobleach FRET in mGAT1 577 XFP 578 CT transporters at the plasma mem - brane in numbers almost equivalent to the wild - type nonfluorescent mGAT1 . N - terminal fluorophore additions impair mGAT1 function and trafficking The N - terminally labeled XFP15mGAT1 fusions were primarily retained within intracellular regions ( Fig . 5 D ) and displayed significantly reduced [ 3 H ] GABA uptake compared with wild - type mGAT1 ( CFP15mGAT1 35 ± 2 % and YFP15mGAT1 28 ± 6 % ; Fig . 5 E ) . This extended our previous experience with an N - terminally labeled GFPmGAT1 fusion that had only eight amino acids in its linker between the fluorophore and the mGAT1 ; the previous construct also failed to localize appropriately to the plasma membrane ( Chiu et al . , 2002 ) . Acceptor photobleach FRET with fluorescent mGAT1 constructs shows that oligomerization is required for wild - type function Dimerization / oligomerization of SLC6 transporter pro - tomers is required for export of functional transporter from the ER to the plasma membrane ( Farhan et al . , 2006 ; Bartholomäus et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , fluores - cent mGAT1 constructs that behaved functionally like wild - type mGAT1 were expected to form oligomers of mGAT1 protomers . We studied the assembly of our fluo - rescent GAT1 constructs using the acceptor photobleach FRET technique ( Nashmi et al . , 2003 ) . We first investi - gated acceptor photobleach FRET between mGAT1XFP * Figure 6 . FRET assessed by acceptor photobleach .

( E ) Mean acceptor photobleach and donor photorecovery for the CFP15mGAT1 / YFP15mGAT1 cotransfection in N2a cells ( n = 5 ) . Moss et al . 499 lyzed the number of NFRET components , their am - plitudes , and the proportion of the total NFRET distribution represented by each component . Compar - ing these data with the measured functional properties of each construct suggested that the subcomponents of NFRET distributions may represent mGAT1 dimers , higher - order mGAT1 oligomers , and mGAT1 oligomers interacting with PDZ domain – containing complexes , as explained in the Discussion and Appendix . Negative controls with noninteracting membrane proteins For the negative control , we expressed two fluorescently tagged plasma membrane proteins , mGAT1 and the  4  2 nAChR , which do not interact in N2a cells ( Drenan et al . , 2008 ) . The mGAT1CFP8 construct was cotrans - fected with plasmids that assemble  4YFP /  2 nAChRs ( Nashmi et al . , 2003 ; Khakh et al . , 2005 ; Drenan et al . , 2008 ; Son et al . , 2009 ) . Control transfections of mGAT1CFP8 /  4 /  2 and mGAT1 /  4YFP /  2 plasmids ( 250 ng of each plasmid ) were also performed ( a ) to subcellularly differentiated ROIs would introduce error in the temporal resolution because imaging would be far slower than the dynamics of transporter trafficking . To determine FRET in specific ROIs , we used a spec - trally resolved , sensitized emission FRET approach that determines FRET in a sample on a pixel - by - pixel basis and during the few microseconds required to measure each pixel ( pixels are 69 - nm squares ) . The spectrally unmixed images provide data similar to the three - filter method reported by Xia and Liu ( 2001 ) , but using an optically more efficient , simultaneous detection of pho - tons . Furthermore , we included the NFRET amplitude of each pixel as a datum in the analysis rather than aver - aging the signal amplitudes of all the pixels in an ROI . As shown below , this technique revealed that ( a ) FRET varies among subcellular compartments as defined by each ROI , and ( b ) within every ROI , the total NFRET distribution consists of two or three subcomponents , each with a distinct mean NFRET amplitude . For each fluorescent mGAT1 construct design studied , we ana - Figure 7 . Pixel - by - pixel quantification of sensitized emission FRET between mGAT1CFP8 and  4YFP  2 nAChRs .

The calculated peripheral NFRET for co - expressed mGAT1CFP8 and  4YFP /  2 nAChR was also negative ( Fig . 7 B and Table I ) . Fig . 7 C introduces frequency distributions of NFRET amplitudes from each pixel of several dozen cells . These data are binned to form all - pixel NFRET amplitude dis - tributions : NFRET amplitude on the x axis and number of pixels on the y axis . Although the NFRET distribu - tions for both ROIs for these negative control transfec - tions were best fit with two Gaussians , both components had negative mean NFRET amplitudes ( Fig . 7 C ) . These data confirm that the method detects no interaction be - tween the  4  2 nAChR and GAT1 in intracellular re - gions or in the cell periphery . Region - specific FRET quantification reveals high FRET efficiency in the periphery of cells expressing fluorescent GAT1 constructs that exhibit wild - type function To investigate FRET between fluorescent GAT1 fusions , we defined four ROIs for each cell imaged . These were named the “whole cell ROI , ” the “intracellular ROI , ” the “perinuclear ROI , ” and the “peripheral ROI . ” The whole cell and peripheral ROIs were defined in the con - trol experiments . Intracellular ROI is the space within the concentrated fluorescence at the cell periphery , but subtracting the dark space occupied by the cell nucleus , and is densely filled by ER ( Fig . S1 A ) . The perinuclear generate reference spectra and ( b ) to determine spec - tral bleedthrough as described previously . Both fluo - rescently tagged proteins maintained their normal expression pattern when coexpressed in N2a cells ( Fig . 7 A ) : the fluorescence pattern for fluorescent  4YFP  2 nAChRs was uniform with little enhancement at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 7 A ) , as described previ - ously in N2a cells ( Drenan et al . , 2008 ; Son et al . , 2009 ) , and the fluorescence pattern for mGAT1CFP8 resem - bled that of Fig . 3 . We defined a whole cell ROI that encompassed all the fluorescent pixels in the cell minus the nonfluorescent cell nucleus . The mean NFRET for all pixels within this ROI for cells coexpressing mGAT1CFP8 and  4YFP /  2 nAChR was negative , indicating that no FRET occurred and that there was some overcorrection for donor and acceptor bleedthrough when there was no FRET ( Fig . 7 B and Table I ) . Because the mGAT1CFP8 construct localized strongly in the cell periphery , we used this fluorescence to de - fine a second ROI that contributed “peripheral NFRET . ” The peripheral ROI encompassed both the plasma membrane and a narrow annulus (  700 nm ) of imme - diately adjacent cytoplasm . We use this description because constructs such as mGAT1 0 XFP exhibit con - centrated fluorescence in the cell periphery due to pooling of transporter - containing vesicles within  500 nm of the outer lipid bilayer of the cell , rather than because TABLE I Average NFRET for all pixels measured in each ROI Transfection ROI NFRET Whole Cell Intracellular Perinuclear Periphery Mean a Median IQR Pixels ( ×10 5 ) Mean a Median IQR Pixels ( ×10 5 ) Mean a Median IQR Pixels ( ×10 5 ) Mean a Median IQR Pixels ( ×10 5 )  4YFP /  2CFP / mGAT1 0 . 20 0 . 20 0 . 09 3 . 9  4YFP /  2 / mGAT1CFP8  0 . 08  0 . 08 0 . 31 4 . 3  0 . 14  0 . 13 0 . 12 0 . 7 mGAT1XFP * 0 . 10 0 . 10 0 . 09 7 . 3 0 . 10 0 . 09 0 . 09 4 . 7 0 . 07 0 . 07 0 . 10 1 . 8 0 . 11 0 . 11 0 . 11 2 . 2 mGAT1XFP8 0 . 10 0 . 09 0 . 10 7 . 7 0 . 09 0 . 07 0 . 07 4 . 0 0 . 08 0 . 07 0 . 06 1 . 2 0 . 13 0 . 11 0 . 14 3 . 3 mGAT1XFP45 0 . 04 0 . 02 0 . 14 3 . 1 0 . 03 0 . 01 0 . 13 2 . 5 0 . 08 0 . 05 0 . 18 0 . 9 0 . 01  0 . 004 0 . 12 0 . 2 mGAT1 565 XFP 566 CT 0 . 18 0 . 17 0 . 11 4 . 3 0 . 17 0 . 16 0 . 11 3 . 1 0 . 17 0 . 16 0 . 11 1 . 7 0 . 18 0 . 17 0 . 11 0 . 7 mGAT1 570 XFP 571 CT 0 . 12 0 . 11 0 . 09 4 . 5 0 . 11 0 . 10 0 . 09 3 . 0 0 . 11 0 . 11 0 . 07 1 . 5 0 . 12 0 . 11 0 . 09 0 . 9 mGAT1 577 XFP 578 CT 0 . 16 0 . 14 0 . 16 2 . 6 0 . 12 0 . 10 0 . 13 1 . 3 0 . 12 0 . 10 0 . 12 0 . 7 0 . 20 0 . 18 0 . 17 1 . 2 mGAT1 0 XFP 0 . 13 0 . 11 0 . 11 23 0 . 13 0 . 12 0 . 11 15 0 . 12 0 . 11 0 . 10 3 . 9 0 . 11 0 . 09 0 . 10 7 . 6 a Standard error of the mean NFRET values range from 6 × 10  5 to 7 × 10  4 . the sum of the fit is shown as a solid line .

S1 B ) . Fluorescence images of cells coexpressing the CFP and YFP variants of fluorescent GAT1 fusions were acquired and processed as described above . Sensitized FRET from cells expressing the wild - type – like C - terminal fusion constructs mGAT1XFP * and mGAT1XFP8 confirmed earlier acceptor photobleach FRET findings that oligomerization was required to ob - serve wild - type – like function from our fluorescent constructs ( Fig . 8 ) . In addition , for mGAT1XFP * and mGAT1XFP8 , respectively , NFRET images showed that 30 . 1 and 43 . 3 % of the whole cell ROI NFRET signal came from the peripheral ROI ( Fig . 8 , A and E , and Table I ) . The mean NFRET amplitudes for all pixels in an ROI for N2a cells expressing mGAT1XFP * or mGAT1XFP8 constructs were greatest in the peripheral ROI compared with the intracellular or the perinuclear ROIs ( Fig . 8 , B and F , and Table I ) . Specifically , the ratios of NFRET in the peripheral ROI were 1 . 6 - and 1 . 7 - fold greater than in the perinuclear ROIs for mGAT1XFP * and mGAT1XFP8 , respectively . Also , the reported NFRET from pixels in the peripheral ROI of mGATXFP8 - expressing cells had a much broader IQR than those from the perinuclear ROI ( Fig . 8 F and Table I ) . mGAT1 oligomerization was therefore detected in all ROIs , but an additional molecular event , specifi - cally localized to the periphery of cells expressing mGAT1XFP * and mGAT1XFP8 , resulted in elevated FRET in this region . Analysis of the NFRET distribu - tions from each ROI determined that the NFRET from the intracellular and perinuclear ROIs of mGAT1XFP * - or mGAT1XFP8 - expressing cells were best fit with two Gaussians , both reporting positive mean NFRET . How - ever , the whole cell ROIs and the peripheral ROIs were best fit with three Gaussians ( Fig . 8 , D and H ) . The highest - amplitude NFRET component ( 1 . 2 - to 1 . 8 - fold greater mean NFRET than from the intermediate - am - plitude component ) represented 27 – 30 % of the pixels in the peripheral ROIs ( Fig . 8 , C , D , G , and H ) . Among the three subcellular ROIs , this highest - amplitude com - ponent appeared only in the peripheral ROI and was accompanied by an  30 % reduction in the peripheral ROI NFRET signal contributed by the lowest - amplitude component when compared with the intracellular or perinuclear ROIs ( Fig . 8 , C , D , G , and H ) . Thus , for the wild - type – like functioning mGAT1XFP * and mGAT1XFP8 , we infer that two different oligomeriza - tion events were described by the low - and intermedi - ate - amplitude components that were common to the NFRET distributions of all examined ROIs ( see Discus - sion and Appendix ) . In addition , elevated mean NFRET in the peripheral ROI versus intracellular regions cor - responded to the third high - amplitude component in the peripheral ROI NFRET distribution . We infer that a specific mGAT1 oligomerization or interaction event—the molecular correlate for the third high - amp - litude NFRET component—is highly localized to the cell periphery . Sensitized NFRET from mGAT1XFP45 , which re - ported little function and no FRET by acceptor photo - bleach analysis , was studied pixel by pixel ( Fig . 9 ) . This method did detect some mGAT1XFP45 oligomeriza - tion in small regions . These pixels were too few to influ - ence the whole cell averaging algorithms that calculated FRET by acceptor photobleaching . The perinuclear ROI contained most of these small regions highlighted by the sensitized NFRET approach in mGAT1XFP45 - expressing specimens . The mean NFRET amplitude for all pixels in the perinuclear ROI resembled that re - corded for mGAT1XFP * or mGAT1XFP8 ( Fig . 9 B and Table I ) . For mGAT1XFP45 , the FRETing pixels in the peripheral ROI contributed only 6 . 4 % of the whole cell ROI NFRET signal , nonetheless indicating that some oligomerized mGAT1XFP45’s were exported from the perinuclear region and could eventually contribute to the small but significant [ 3 H ] GABA uptake for this con - struct in the functional assays . The NFRET distributions for all ROIs of mGATXFP45 - expressing cells were best fit with two Gaussians , the first of which reported a neg - ative mean NFRET ( Fig . 9 , C and D ) . The positive popu - lation made up > 75 % of the NFRET signal in the peripheral and perinuclear ROIs . We observed that the mean NFRET of the positive Gaussian component was 1 . 4 - fold larger in the peripheral ROI compared with the same component of the mGAT1XFP45 perinuclear ROI NFRET . Even though very few mGAT1XFP45 oligomers inserted into the plasma membrane , it appeared that those that did insert were subject to the same molecular event that caused increased FRET in the periphery of cells expressing wild - type functioning fluorescent mGAT1 constructs . Next , we examined the FRET of the mGAT1 5xx XFP 5xx CT constructs , which show a graded improvement in func - tion as the XFP moiety is moved downstream within the C terminus away from TM12 ( Fig . 5 ) . mGAT1 565 XFP 566 CT reported a robust mean NFRET amplitude for all pixels ( ≥0 . 17 ) in all ROIs examined ( Fig . 10 , A and B , and Table I ) , indicating that significant transporter oligo - merization was occurring . However , the poor function of this construct , the completely internal distribution of fluorescence in 27 % of cells expressing these constructs , and the minor component ( 16 % of the whole cell ROI NFRET ) contributed from the peripheral ROI lead us to conclude that the NFRET signal was mainly due to assembled intracellular mGAT1 565 XFP 566 CT rather than plasma membrane – inserted transporters , even in the peripheral ROI . The ratio of the mean NFRET for all pixels in the peripheral ROI compared with the perinuclear ROI was 0 . 99 . mGAT1 565 XFP 566 CT NFRET Moss et al . 503 pressing mGAT1 570 XFP 571 CT was similar between the peripheral and perinuclear ROIs ( ratio 1 . 0 ) . Analysis of the NFRET distributions for each ROI determined that all were best fit with two Gaussians ( Fig . 10 , G and H ) . However , in the periphery , the two components did not appear to describe the same populations reported by the components of the other ROIs . The mean amp - litude of the major peripheral NFRET component ( 98 % of the signal ) lay approximately halfway between the amplitudes of the two NFRET components of the peri - nuclear , intracellular , or whole cell ROIs . We suggest that two Gaussian components merged into one with an intermediate NFRET amplitude in the periphery be - cause the populations mix at a level too fine to resolve in a 69 - nm 2 pixel ( see Appendix ) . The second compo - nent of the mGAT1 570 XFP 571 CT peripheral NFRET signal had a mean amplitude ( 0 . 29 ± 0 . 09 ) twice that observed for the second Gaussian component of the perinuclear ROI NFRET ( Fig . 10 , G and H ) . Although contributing only a small fraction ( 2 . 3 % ) of the total sig - nal for the peripheral ROI , the ratio of mean NFRET amp - litude of this component versus the second component distributions were best fit with two Gaussians in all ROIs examined ( Fig . 10 , C and D ) . In the peripheral and perinuclear ROIs , the two subpopulations contributed approximately equally to the total NFRET signal . In the intracellular ROI , the lower mean NFRET signal predominated . The mean NFRET amplitude from mGAT1 570 XFP 571 CT - expressing cells ( Fig . 10 , E and F , and Table I ) was less than that from those expressing mGAT1 565 XFP 566 CT . This probably arose in part from the increased fluoro - phore separation in this construct . The XFP moiety is fused five residues more distal from the end of the TM12 helix in the mGAT1 570 XFP 571 CT constructs . Exact inter - molecular distances cannot be calculated from FRET efficiencies of proteins fused to GFP derivatives ( Rizzo et al . , 2006 ) . However , side - by - side FRET efficiency calculations ( using Eq . 4 ) suggested that in the perinu - clear ROIs , the apparent fluorophore separation in mGAT1 570 XFP 571 CT oligomers ( E = 7 . 9 ± 1 . 9 % ) is on av - erage 1 . 25 - fold greater than in mGAT1 565 XFP 566 CT oligomers ( E = 25 ± 3 . 5 % ) . As for mGAT1 565 XFP 566 CT , the mean NFRET amplitude from all pixels in cells ex - Figure 9 . Pixel - by - pixel quantification of sensitized emission FRET between mGAT1XFP45 .

Moss et al . 505 of the perinuclear or intracellular ROIs ( 2 . 1 and 1 . 7 , re - spectively ) resembled that of the highest - amplitude component of mGAT1XFP * or mGAT1XFP8 NFRET ( Fig . 8 ) . The small but measureable high - amplitude NFRET component in the mGAT1 570 XFP 571 CT periph - eral NFRET signal presumably reflects its impaired plasma membrane insertion , as determined by GABA uptake assays ( Fig . 5 B ) , and is also consistent with the observation that mGAT1 570 XFP 571 CT functions better than mGAT1 565 XFP 566 CT ( Fig . 5 B ) . mGAT1 577 XFP 578 CT , which exhibited almost wild - type function ( Fig . 5 , B and C ) , displayed strong mean NFRET for all pixels in the peripheral ROI , 1 . 7 - fold greater than that observed in the perinuclear ROI ( Fig . 11 , A and B , and Table I ) . This NFRET amplitude was 1 . 5 - to 1 . 8 - fold stronger than that for the mean NFRET amplitude from all pixels in the peripheral ROI of mGAT1XFP * - or mGAT1XFP8 - expressing cells ( Fig . 8 ) . As observed for those other wild - type functioning C - terminal fusions , the NFRET amplitude in the intra - cellular and whole cell ROIs was significantly less . The NFRET distributions from intracellular and perinuclear ROIs of mGAT1 577 XFP 578 CT - expressing N2a cells could be fitted with two Gaussians with low and intermediate mean NFRET amplitudes , the latter component provid - ing approximately two thirds of the NFRET signal in the perinuclear ROI ( Fig . 11 , C and D ) . Importantly , in the peripheral ROI , a third Gaussian component ap - peared ; this component was also detectable in the whole cell ROI ( Fig . 11 D ) . This component had a mean NFRET amplitude ( 0 . 31 ± 0 . 04 ) twice that of the sec - ond intermediate - amplitude NFRET component and comprised  30 % of the peripheral NFRET signal .

Colocalization analysis of the YFP fluorescence and the nF signal in the same group of cells reported that r = 0 . 5 ± 0 . 05 ( Fig . 12 B ) . The square of r indicated that 25 ± 1 . 5 % of the variance of nF in mGAT1XFP8 - expressing cells is associated with changes in YFP intensity . When the relative contribu - tions of the CFP and YFP intensities to the FRET signal in each pixel were normalized to generate the NRET images from the same cells , r = 0 . 01 ± 0 . 05 for I YFP versus NFRET colocalization ( Fig . 12 B ) . This indicated that the normalization step in NFRET corrects for the influ - ence of I YFP variance . One concludes that calculated NFRET was not artificially large due to high local I YFP in some ROIs . functioning mGAT1XFP * and mGAT1XFP8 constructs ( Fig . 8 ) . High NFRET in the peripheral ROI is independent of variance of YFP intensity We examined whether high NFRET amplitudes mea - sured in this study , particularly those at the periphery of cells expressing the wild - type functioning mGAT1XFP8 constructs , were large because of high local concentra - tions of YFP - tagged protomers in some domains . Line profile plots through cells expressing mGAT1XFP8 em - phasized that the pixels with the greatest YFP signal in - tensity were usually located at the periphery of the cell ( Fig . 12 A ) , as were the pixels with the highest amp - litude net FRET ( nF ) or NFRET . We measured the colo - calization of the YFP signal with both the nF signal and the NFRET signals . As a positive control , we determined Figure 12 .

The pixels con - tained within each bin or group are highlighted with the same color in the NFRET image ( Fig . 13 B ) . We cal - culated each pixel’s percent radial distance from the cell’s center to the cell periphery . We analyzed the local - ization of NFRET amplitude for three representative constructs : mGAT1XFP8 , which oligomerized efficiently as determined by acceptor photobleach and sensitized FRET analysis and functioned like wild - type nonlabeled mGAT1 ; mGAT1 565 XFP 566 CT , which showed strong FRET but compromised function ; and mGAT1XFP45 , which demonstrated weak function and weak FRET . The results of the analyses plotted in Fig . 13 C determined Radial distance analysis of NFRET signal amplitude correlates to functional phenotype The presence of the three NFRET components from only the fluorescent mGAT1 constructs with wild - type – like function suggested that one component arose from a mechanism that operates only in the cell periphery for mGAT1 oligomers , which are appropriately inserted into the plasma membrane . Apparently , this plasma membrane – associated component is also the compo - nent with the highest NFRET amplitude . We have al - ready qualitatively observed that the largest amplitude NFRET signal occurred in the periphery of the cell ( Fig . 12 A ) . As described in Materials and methods , we further analyzed NFRET images by grouping pixels into Figure 13 . Radial analysis of NFRET amplitude distributions . ( A ) Exemplar NFRET distribution with bins colored by percentile NFRET amplitude . The colors of the pixels in each bin were applied to the NFRET images as displayed in B .

For these constructs , the peripheral ROI NFRET distributions could be fitted to three Gaussian components , and we have presented analyses that the highest - amplitude component arises from plasma membrane molecules . On the other hand , constructs with significantly reduced substrate transport rates ( corresponding to reduced plasma membrane inser - tion ) relative to wild - type GAT1 displayed peripheral ROI NFRET distributions comprising only two compo - nents ( Fig . 14 B ) . The data suggest a threshold effect : if the peripheral NFRET distribution includes ≥  30 % of the high - amplitude NFRET component , fluores - cent mGAT1 molecules exhibit wild - type – like func - tion ( Fig . 14 B ) . that the NFRET signals from pixels in cells expressing mGAT1XFP8 were the most peripherally located ; the minimum percent distance from the center of mass for any NFRET amplitude percentile group was > 85 % . The pixels in the top fifth percentile of NFRET amplitude for mGAT1XFP8 were located a mean distance of 93 % of the total radius from the center to mass to the edge of the cell , quantifying the statement that the highest - amplitude NFRET pixels were also the most peripher - ally located in the cell . Overall , the localization of NFRET signals of all amplitudes from pixels expressing mGAT1 565 XFP 566 CT trended toward the cell periphery rather than the center of mass , but significantly less so than from mGAT1XFP8 . The trend followed a U - shaped pattern , with the bottom and top 20 % NFRET pixel amplitudes being the most peripherally located ( > 70 % ) , and the medium amplitude NFRET pixels residing in more intracellular locations . Localization of mGAT1XFP45 pixels that reported positive NFRET trended to more random distributions with increas - ing NFRET amplitude . Correlation between function of fluorescent mGAT1 transporters and their NFRET properties Fig . 14 provides two ways to summarize the trends in NFRET and their relationship to function ( [ 3 H ] GABA uptake ) of mGAT1 constructs . Both panels of Fig . 14 highlight the set of three correctly oligomerized , cor - rectly trafficked , and correctly functioning fluores - cent constructs : mGAT1XFP * , mGAT1XFP8 , and mGAT 577 XFP 578 CT . In Fig . 14 A , we compare the function of each fluorescent construct ( relative to nontagged wild - type mGAT1 ) versus the ratio of peripheral to peri - nuclear NFRET . The peripheral / perinuclear ratio was calculated from the mean NFRET for all pixels in each ROI . In this analysis , the fluorescent transporters could be classified into three groups : ( 1 ) The three constructs with > 75 % wild - type func - tion , as determined by [ 3 H ] GABA uptake , displayed a peripheral / perinuclear NFRET ratio ≥1 . 4 . ( 2 ) Constructs with compromised function ( 30 – 65 % wild - type [ 3 H ] GABA uptake ) demonstrated efficient oligomerization as determined by FRET quantifica - tion , but less efficient plasma membrane insertion , indicated by peripheral / perinuclear NFRET ratios close to 1 . 0 . ( 3 ) Represented by mGAT1XFP45 , the constructs that display < 30 % of wild type function , limited oligo - merization , and poor trafficking properties expressed a peripheral / perinuclear NFRET ratio of 0 . 1 . Wild - type functioning fluorescent transporters could therefore be clearly distinguished from constructs with poor oligomerization and / or trafficking : the former possess a peripheral / perinuclear NFRET ratio ≥1 . 4 . Fig . 14 B presents an additional hallmark of the three well - functioning constructs ( as shown by [ 3 H ] GABA Figure 14 . The relationship between transporter function and NFRET . ( A ) Scatter plot of the ratio and mean ( peripheral NFRET ) / ( perinuclear NFRET ) for all pixels in the ROIs versus the percent function of each construct as compared with nonfluo - rescent wild - type mGAT1 in [ 3 H ] GABA uptake assays .

Constructs that showed ≤65 % wild - type function but good whole cell NFRET are represented by half - filled symbols . mGAT1XFP45 , which demonstrated poor function and poor whole cell NFRET , is represented by an open symbol . ( B ) The proportions of each Gaussian component of the total peripheral ROI NFRET signal for each construct are plotted in stacked columns . Each column represents a single construct design and appears on the x axis at the percentage of wild - type [ 3 H ] GABA uptake it exhibits in uptake assays . Moss et al . 509 analyzed pixels was best fit by two Gaussian components , with mean NFRET of 0 . 19 ( representing 75 % of all FRETing pixels ) and 0 . 28 ( Fig . 15 C ) . C - terminal PDZ interactions are required to produce NFRET distributions comprising three Gaussian components The PDZ type II – interacting domain at the distal C ter - minus of mGAT1 is necessary for at least two important transporter interactions in the cell periphery : with the exocyst complex ( Farhan et al . , 2004 ) and with the actin cytoskeleton ( Imoukhuede et al . , 2009 ) . To determine whether an interaction of the C - terminal mGAT1 PDZ - interaction domain produced the observed third , high NFRET component in peripheral ROI NFRET distribu - tions , we coexpressed mGAT1 0 CFP and mGAT1 0 YFP and examined the resulting subcellular NFRET profiles . As demonstrated earlier ( Fig . 4 A ) , this construct design had compromised function . This occurs because the XFP moiety blocks access to the endogenous PDZ - inter - action domain of mGAT1 ( Imoukhuede et al . , 2009 ) . Fig . 16 A displays representative images of the donor and acceptor fluorescence in an mGAT1 0 XFP - express - ing cell together with the defined ROIs and calculated NFRET image . The ratio of mean NFRET amplitude for the peripheral versus the perinuclear regions for 63 cells expressing mGAT1 0 XFP was 0 . 9 ( Fig . 16 B and Ta - ble I ) , in contrast to 1 . 4 observed above for mGAT1XFP8 ( Fig . 8 F and Table I ) . Furthermore , the NFRET distri - butions for all ROIs from mGAT1 0 XFP - expressing cells were best fit by two Gaussian components . This indi - cated that mGAT1 transporters must possess a func - tional C - terminal PDZ - interacting domain to exhibit Nicotinic receptors also display a two - component NFRET distribution Data presented to this point indicate that mGAT1 , a mem - brane protein , displays only a two - component NFRET distribution if its oligomers are not inserted into the plasma membrane at normal wild - type levels . We as - sessed whether this conclusion holds for another mem - brane protein whose oligomerization has been studied in our laboratory in the N2a system : the heteropentam - eric mouse  4  2 nAChR ( Nashmi et al . , 2003 ; Drenan et al . , 2008 ; Son et al . , 2009 ) . Previous data indicate that  4  2 receptors are retained to a large extent in intracel - lular compartments ( Nashmi et al . , 2003 ; Kuryatov et al . , 2005 ; Sallette et al . , 2005 ; Drenan et al . , 2008 ; Son et al . , 2009 ) . As with previous studies of this channel expressed in N2a cells ( Drenan et al . , 2008 ; Son et al . , 2009 ) , HEK 293 cells ( Nashmi et al . , 2003 ) , transfected neurons ( Nashmi et al . , 2003 ; Khakh et al . , 2005 ) , and  4YFP knock - in mice ( Nashmi et al . , 2007 ) , the fluorescence of both  4YFP and  2CFP nAChR subunits appeared evenly throughout the ER of N2a cells ( Fig . 13 A ) , with a high degree of colocalization ( Pearson product - moment correlation coefficient : r = 0 . 9 ± 0 . 02 ; n = 11 cells ) ( not depicted ) . As described above ( Fig . 7 ) , the even fluores - cence distribution throughout the cell provided only a single ROI per cell for this transfection : the ROI encom - passed the entire cell without the nucleus . This was de - termined by the pixels exhibiting YFP fluorescence . Robust FRET was observed throughout cells coex - pressing  4YFP  2CFP nAChR subunits ; the mean NFRET for all pixels was 0 . 20 ( Fig . 15 , A and B , and Table I ) .

The intracellular and perinuclear ROIs were best fit with two Gaussian compo - nents ( Fig . 17 C ) . Treatment of mGATXFP8 - expressing cells with latrunculin B produced NFRET distributions from whole cell and peripheral ROIs that were best fit with two Gaussian components , similar to data for the fluores - cent mGAT1 constructs with less than wild - type function ( Fig . 17 D ) . Latrunculin B treatment therefore demon - strated that the polymerized actin cytoskeleton was re - quired for the PDZ - interacting domain – mediated high NFRET component in the cell periphery . Interestingly , the perinuclear ROI of latrunculin B – treated cells was best fit by three Gaussian components ( Fig . 17 D ) . A three - component perinuclear distribu - tion was not found under other conditions in this study . The amplitude of the third component was equivalent to that seen in the periphery of nontreated cells and comprised a similar proportion of the total NFRET dis - tribution in that ROI (  30 % ; Fig . 17 E ) . This was not observed in the perinuclear ROI of mGAT1 0 XFP - ex - pressing cells , suggesting that the intact PDZ - interact - ing domain of mGAT1XFP8 plays a role . the third high - amplitude NFRET component in the cell periphery . PDZ - mediated tethering to the cytoskeleton locates third high - amplitude NFRET component in the cell periphery A PDZ domain interaction occurs in the ezrin - mediated tethering of mGAT1 oligomers to the actin cytoskeleton ( Imoukhuede et al . , 2009 ) . We therefore investigated whether an intact cytoskeleton is required for the ob - served high NFRET component at the cell periphery . We transfected N2a cells with the mGAT1XFP8 con - structs and in half of the transfected dishes depolymerized the actin cytoskeleton with 5 µM latrunculin B ( Fig . 17 ) . As previously observed , mGAT1XFP8 showed detectable NFRET in all ROIs . The ratio of mean peripheral to peri - nuclear NFRET amplitude was 1 . 4 ( Fig . 17 B , left ; 67 cells , 4 . 7 and 1 . 8 × 10 5 pixels , respectively ) . 5 µM latrunculin B decreased this ratio to 0 . 9 ( Fig . 17 B , right ) . The NFRET distributions for nontreated mGAT1XFP8 - expressing N2a cells were fit with three Gaussian components in the whole cell and peripheral ROIs , with the highest mean amp - litude NFRET component comprising  30 % of the total Figure 16 .

( D ) Distributions of NFRET signal amplitude per pixel for each ROI ( bin width , 0 . 02 ) from mGAT1 0 XFP - expressing cells . The individual components and the sum of the fit are shown as dashed and solid lines , respectively . Moss et al . 511 tation was introduced into every construct ( Zacharias et al . , 2002 ) . ( 2 ) The GAT1 protomers might have no tendency to associate directly and are distributed randomly in cellu - lar membranes , with FRET occurring through stochas - tic interactions in domains where the protomers are clustered at high density . Thus , controlling for colli - sional FRET is critical ( Blackman et al . , 1998 ; Tadross et al . , 2009 ) . In this paper , we believe there is minimum contribution from this scenario : at the expression levels used in this study , for constructs that exhibit > 25 % wild - type mGAT1 function , very little of the total NFRET arises from stochastic interactions of high local concen - trations of mGAT1XFP monomers . To support this statement , we invoke the examples of the mGAT1XFP45 and the XFP15mGAT1 constructs . Neither of these ex - hibited FRET by the acceptor photobleach method , despite extensive colocalization of CFP - and YFP - tagged mGAT1 protomers . In the pixel - by - pixel analysis of sen - sitized mGAT1XFP45 NFRET , some positively FRETing pixels were observed . However , a fraction of the mGAT1XFP45 FRETing pixels is also expected to repre - sent the small proportion of mGAT1XFP45 protomers that was able to assemble as functional oligomers and traffic to the plasma membrane , as reported by the [ 3 H ] GABA uptake assays . Oligomerization is a prereq - uisite for ER export of the SLC6 family of transporters ( Farhan et al . , 2006 ; Bartholomäus et al . , 2008 ) ; there - fore , the functional mGAT1XFP45 construct in the plasma membrane must be at least a dimer . In summary , we be - lieve that donor – acceptor excitations are rare occur - rences unless the fluorophores are part of a biologically functional oligomeric complex . ( 3 ) Therefore , in all likelihood , mGAT1 dimers and possibly higher - order oligomers ( e . g . , dimers of dimers or trimers of dimers ) assemble . Even if mGAT1 can only maximally oligomerize as dimers , a high concentration of dimers in a particular domain can result in inter - di - mer energy transfer , producing NFRET . In our linear expression system , we expect minimal contributions of inter - oligomer proximity to the measured NFRET amp - litude , for the same reason that we expect little contri - bution to the NFRET amplitude from random proximity of donor - and acceptor - tagged mGAT1 monomers . The basic oligomeric unit of mGAT1 is a dimer , and an atomic - scale structure is available for dimers of a homolo - gous transporter ( Yamashita et al . , 2005 ) . Features of this dimer render it unlikely that a trimer would form , so that the simplest likely high - order oligomer is a dimer of dimers . The Appendix presents assumptions and calcu - lations analyzing the FRET properties of dimers and tetramers . The results are consistent with the idea that the first and second Gaussian components of the all - pixel mGAT1 NFRET amplitude distributions represent the dimer and a high - order oligomerization state ( probably a square or rhomboid tetramer ) , respectively . D I S C U S S I O N FRET between GFP variant - tagged molecules reports separations of < 100 Å . In live cells , this distance can be achieved only by directly interacting proteins ( Sekar and Periasamy , 2003 ) . FRET has previously demon - strated that GAT1 and other SLC6 neurotransmitter transporters oligomerize ( Soragna et al . , 2005 ; Farhan et al . , 2006 ; Bartholomäus et al . , 2008 ) . The dimeriza - tion of transporter protomers is required for efficient export from the ER ( Farhan et al . , 2006 ) . Acceptor pho - tobleach FRET gave good whole cell measurements of mGAT1 assembly but did not differentiate between fluo - rescent constructs with wild - type – like or compromised plasma membrane insertion . Pixel - by - pixel analysis of NFRET allowed the accurate measurement of FRET in various subcellular regions , and the individual components of NFRET distributions in each ROI correlate with functional phenotype . Ana - lyzing each construct’s number of Gaussian compo - nents in an NFRET distribution overcame complications from the fact that each construct has a unique separa - tion and / or orientation between fluorophores . We sim - ply assumed that the rank order of NFRET distribution components arises from mechanisms that are common across the entire set of constructs . We observed at least two oligomerization states of the mGAT1 transporter in the basal state ( in the absence of substrate ) . These oligomerization states probably bear no relation to the time - resolved conformational states that occur during the permeation cycle for the SLC6 neurotransmitter transporter family ( Mager et al . , 1994 ; Li et al . , 2000 ; Loo et al . , 2000 ; Kanner , 2003 ; Rudnick , 2006 ) . Rather , they represent the basic oligomer formed by mGAT1 protomers and high - order complexes of basic mGAT1 oligomers ( e . g . , dimers of dimers ) . In intracellular organelles ( e . g . , ER or Golgi ) , these two oligomer types are represented by two Gaussian compo - nents of the NFRET distribution . A third mGAT1 oligo - mer exists in the periphery of cells expressing fluorescent transporters that are functionally indistinguishable from the nontagged wild - type mGAT1 . This species is repre - sented in NFRET distributions by a third Gaussian com - ponent that always possesses the highest mean amplitude of the three . If the high - amplitude component accounts for  30 % of the total NFRET distribution , the fluores - cent mGAT1 construct functions with > 75 % of the wild - type rate . Oligomeric states may generate the components in the Gaussian fits to mGAT1 NFRET distributions We consider three explanations for the measured NFRET between fluorescently tagged GAT1 protomers . ( 1 ) The XFPs themselves might drive apparent oligo - merization of the fused protein of interest . We rule out this possibility because the monomeric A206K mu - 512 NFRET resolves GAT1 oligomerization state and anchoring Figure 17 .

The individual components Moss et al . 513 When NFRET distributions are fit to three Gaussian components , the highest NFRET component reports the specific locations of mGAT1 C - terminal PDZ interactions The peripheral ROI includes both the plasma mem - brane and the immediately adjacent intracellular re - gion . Several of the constructs display high fluorescence in the cell periphery but have major functional deficits , presumably owing to poor plasma membrane insertion . FRET determined that these constructs with trafficking deficits efficiently oligomerized , but the ratio ( periph - eral NFRET / perinuclear NFRET ) was  1 . 0 ( in contrast to the value of  1 . 4 for the best - inserted constructs ) ( Fig . 14 A ) . Furthermore , both the peripheral and peri - nuclear NFRET distributions were fit by two Gaussian components , again in contrast to the three components for the best - inserted constructs ( Figs . 9 D , 10 , D and H , and 16 D ) . The data are consistent with the idea that well - inserted plasma membrane transporters display an additional component with higher mean NFRET ampli - tude comprising  30 % of the NFRET distribution . In the basal state , one third of the acutely recycling pool of GAT1 transporters resides in the plasma mem - brane ( Wang and Quick , 2005 ) . This fraction resembles the proportion of the total peripheral NFRET repre - sented by the highest - amplitude component in the cell periphery . The radial analysis of NFRET amplitudes ( Fig . 13 ) suggests that the highest - amplitude compo - nent of peripheral NFRET represents most of the fluo - rescent GAT1 complexes inserted into the plasma membrane . Furthermore , the presence of this compo - nent and the proportion of the total NFRET that it rep - resents serve as an indicator of transporter function ; the assay could help in the future design of other fluo - rescent transporter constructs . Judging the generality of the pixel - by - pixel method will require examination with additional classes of transmembrane proteins . We demonstrate here that  4  2 nAChRs predominantly re - side in intracellular compartments in the basal state and have NFRET distributions comprising two Gaussian components ( Fig . 12 ) . These two components may rep - resent the two possible functional stoichiometries of  4 and  2 nAChR subunits , (  4 ) 3 (  2 ) 2 and (  4 ) 2 (  2 ) 3 ( Son et al . , 2009 ) . Moreover , independent investiga - tions suggested the geometry of G protein – coupled receptor oligomers by fitting FRET distributions with Gaussian components ( Raicu et al . , 2009 ) . We determined that the physical origin of the third high NFRET component amplitude for mGAT1 oligo - mers closely associated with the surface membrane re - quires ( a ) that the fluorescent mGAT1 construct possess an intact PDZ type II – interaction domain at the distal C terminus , and ( b ) that the mGAT1 C terminus be teth - ered to the actin cytoskeleton via this domain ( Fig . 16 ) . mGAT1 0 XFP does not interact with PDZ proteins ( Imoukhuede et al . , 2009 ) , limiting its presentation at the plasma membrane ( Chiu et al . , 2002 ) , probably because of compromised interaction with the exocyst ( Farhan et al . , 2004 ) . mGAT1 0 XFP NFRET distributions are always fit to only two Gaussian components in any ROI ( Fig . 16 ) . Furthermore , the NFRET distributions from cells expressing a different class of plasma mem - brane oligomers , the  4  2 nAChR , which does not make direct PDZ - mediated interactions in the cell periphery , can be fit to only two components ( Fig . 15 ) . In N2a cells expressing mGAT1XFP8 , which has a functional PDZ - in - teraction domain , actin depolymerization via latrunculin B eliminated the third high - amplitude NFRET compo - nent present in the peripheral ROI ( Fig . 17 ) . Collectively , these results support the view that , if the C terminus of mGAT1 is tethered to an intact cytoskeleton via a func - tional PDZ - interaction domain , one observes three NFRET components in the periphery . We suggest that this interaction produces the highest mean amplitude NFRET component of the three , and thus this compo - nent can be used as a marker of this intracellular event . Presumably , the fluorophores located at the very distal C termini of mGAT1XFP8 oligomers are constrained in a way that increases FRET . If the tethering restricts the mo - tion of the C terminus without changing the average flu - orophore separation , this might actually decrease FRET ( Lakowicz , 2006b ) . On the other hand , if the tethering draws the C termini closer together , or restricts the ro - tation of the fluorescent moieties to angles that have favorable dipole – dipole coupling , this would markedly increase FRET efficiency . In this investigation , latrunculin B treatment of mGAT1XFP8 - expressing cells was the only manipulation causing three NFRET components in an intracellular ROI . The amplitude and proportion of the total NFRET for the perinuclear ROI of the third component resembled that observed in the periphery of untreated cells . We suspect that the perinuclear high - FRET component for the latrun - culin treatment arose from a pathological concentration of mGAT1 oligomers in perinuclear organelles . In addi - tion to decoupling membrane - resident mGAT1 from the actin cytoskeleton , actin depolymerization disrupts nor - mal endocytosis and endosomal sorting and recycling ( Roux et al . , 2006 ; Gauthier et al . , 2007 ; Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ; Morel et al . , 2009 ) . Significant slowing of actin - dependent endocytic traffic relative to overall mGAT1 insertion rates during latrunculin B incubation would explain our previously observed increases in [ 3 H ] GABA uptake for both mGAT1YFP8 or mGAT1 0 GFP ( Imoukhuede et al . , 2009 ) . Additionally , PDZ - associated and the sum of the fit are shown as dashed and solid lines , respectively .

Trafficking and oligomerization motifs in mGAT1 and similar transporters Appropriate mGAT1 plasma membrane expression re - quires a class II PDZ – interacting motif at the terminal residues of mGAT1 ( Chiu et al . , 2002 ; Farhan et al . , 2004 ) . In mGAT1 , this motif mediates interactions with the exocyst complex ( Farhan et al . , 2004 ) and in tether - ing GAT1 to the actin cytoskeleton ( Imoukhuede et al . , 2009 ) . The present data show that the primary sequence of that motif can be either the native - AYI from GAT1 or another class II motif from a different molecule ( - YKV - CO 2  ) . Both motifs have experimentally determined interaction partners ( Brückner et al . , 1999 ; Lin et al . , 1999 ; McHugh et al . , 2004 ; Imoukhuede et al . , 2009 ) . However , the identity and combination of the hydro - phobic residues at P ( 0 ) and P (  2 ) is important ( Harris and Lim , 2001 ; Sheng and Sala , 2001 ) . The terminal - YKI - CO 2  sequence of mGAT1 0 XFP is not present at the C terminus of any known membrane protein and evi - dently is poorly used by PDZ domain – containing pro - teins in N2a cells or in vivo ( Chiu et al . , 2002 ) . The sequence of the C - terminal type II PDZ – interacting mo - tif and its interacting partners are therefore critical in the events that lead to the emergence of the third high - amplitude component of NFRET in the cell periphery . Besides the terminal type II PDZ – interacting se - quence , apparently no other motifs influence traffick - ing within the sequence between the P (  3 ) and P (  28 ) positions in the GAT1 C terminus . These findings cor - roborate previous studies of truncation mutations in neuronal SLC6 transporter trafficking ( Torres et al . , 2003 ; Farhan et al . , 2004 ) . However , a region in the C termini of SLC6 transporters corresponding to the P (  28 ) through P (  44 ) residues of mGAT1 controls constitutive export of transporter from the ER ( Farhan et al . , 2004 , 2007 , 2008 ) and both constitutive and regu - lated endocytosis ( Holton et al . , 2005 ; Boudanova et al . , 2008 ) . mGAT1XFP45 possesses two copies of this region ( Fig . 2 ) , but its uptake deficit ( Fig . 4 A ) is caused pre - dominantly by poor oligomerization ( Figs . 6 D and 9 ) , rather than by the introduction of additional endocytic or exocytotic motifs . Nonetheless , mGAT1 565 XFP 566 CT showed extensive oligomerization ( Fig . 10 , A – D ) but poor trafficking to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 5 B ) , presum - ably because placing the fluorophore between residues R565 ( P (  33 ) ) and L566 ( P (  32 ) ) ( Fig . 2 ) inhibited interaction with the COPII coat ( Farhan et al . , 2007 ; Reiterer et al . , 2008 ) . Moreover , in mGAT1 565 XFP 566 CT , the XFP is adjacent to the 562 LKQR 565 residues ( analogous to 587 FREK 590 in hDAT ) that slow the basal rate of transporter internalization ( Boudanova et al . , 2008 ) ; this may result in faster endocytosis for this construct relative to wild - type mGAT1XFP8 oligomers internalized during the early min - utes of the latrunculin B incubation could possibly get trapped inside the cell ( Taunton et al . , 2000 ; Gauthier et al . , 2007 ; Morel et al . , 2009 ) . Nonetheless , exocyst - driven plasma membrane GAT1 insertion requires the transporter’s PDZ - interacting domain ( Farhan et al . , 2004 ) . Most proteins that form the exocyst complex are loaded onto vesicles in the trans - Golgi region ( Munro , 2004 ) , and their trafficking to the site of exocytosis requires an intact actin cytoskeleton ( Boyd et al . , 2004 ) . In latrunculin B – treated N2a cells , mGAT1XFP8 oligomers presumably as - sociate normally via their PDZ - interaction domains , with the vesicle - associated exocyst complex in the vicinity of the trans - Golgi . However , cytoskeletal disruption inhibits transport of the vesicles and their cargo away from this lo - cation , resulting in a third high - amplitude NFRET compo - nent being recorded in the perinuclear ROI . In contrast , despite possessing a wild - type PDZ - interaction domain , the efficiently oligomerized but intracellularly retained mGAT1 565 XFP 566 CT constructs present only two perinu - clear NFRET components because the location of the flu - orophore prevents the normal interaction with the COPII coat complex ( Farhan et al . , 2007 ) . This mutation domi - nates over the PDZ interactions : transporter complexes cannot exit from the ER ( Farhan et al . , 2004 ) to the trans - Golgi , where the first exocyst / PDZ - interacting domain in - teractions occur . Pixel - by - pixel resolution in NFRET Ultimately , one would like to measure the assembly of membrane proteins at single - molecule resolution in each cellular compartment . At present , this is possible only at the plasma membrane using total internal re - flection fluorescence in FRET mode ( Riven et al . , 2006 ; Bal et al . , 2008a , b ) , although superresolution micros - copy may enable further progress ( Hess et al . , 2007 ; Manley et al . , 2008 ; Tokunaga et al . , 2008 ) . We have therefore resorted to measurements on single pixels , 69 - nm square . We estimate that each pixel represents 10 – 150 mGAT1 molecules , based on comparisons with known samples that we have imaged at single - molecule resolution under comparable conditions ( Chiu et al . , 2001 ) . A pixel’s NFRET amplitude is determined by the concentration of each FRET - yielding oligomer type in that pixel ( Corry et al . , 2005b ) , not by the concentra - tion of fluorophores . Methods to measure FRET in biological samples are continually evolving . Recently , investigators have minimized spurious FRET by judi - ciously selecting the fluorophores by using appropriate instrumentation , and by controlling optical variations during both an individual experiment and the entire investigation ( Raicu et al . , 2009 ; Tadross et al . , 2009 ) . Combining these enhancements with the method pre - sented in this paper will further increase the resolution and reliability of confocal FRET data . We hope eventu - ally to determine the supramolecular geometry of the Moss et al . 515 prevent mGAT1 0 GFP from recapitulating its in vivo behav - ior when expressed in HEK 293T cells . The first is overex - pression caused by the presence of the simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) large T antigen in HEK 293T cells , which allows for episomal replication of transfected plasmids , such as the pcDNA3 . 1 ( + ) used in this study , that contain the SV40 origin of replication . Consistent with this hypothesis , [ 3 H ] GABA uptake was maximal in HEK 293T cells trans - fected with only 50 – 100 ng mGAT1 plasmid , yet submaxi - mal for 500 ng of plasmid in N2a cells ( which lack the SV40 T antigen ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Furthermore , the total fluores - cence of mGAT1 0 GFP was almost fivefold greater when expressed in HEK 293T cells compared with N2a cells ( Fig . 1 , D – F ) . We suspect that overexpression of mGAT1 in HEK 293T cells exceeds the capacity of one or more cellu - lar trafficking mechanisms , so that the cell cannot dynami - cally regulate transporter number at the cell surface . A second possible explanation for the difference in traf - ficking between HEK 293T cells and mouse neurons is that HEK 293T cells do not express the necessary collec - tion of associating proteins to regulate GAT1 trafficking appropriately . For example , protein interacting with C kinase 1 ( PICK1 ) , a PDZ protein involved in GAT1 plasma membrane trafficking , is expressed in N2a cells but hardly detectable in HEK 293 cells ( Bjerggaard et al . , 2004 ) . How - ever , HEK 293T cells appear to process and traffic mGAT - 1 0 GFP like wild - type mGAT1 , suggesting that this cell type does not rely on PDZ interactions to deliver GAT1 to or stabilize its presence at the plasma membrane . Rather , HEK 293T cells may use distinct pathways for these pro - cesses . In fact , hNET mutants with truncated C termini function like wild - type transporter in HEK 293 cells ( from which HEK 293T is derived ) , although in many other cell lines , truncation mutants exhibit reduced substrate uptake ( Bauman and Blakely , 2002 ) . HEK 293T cells were valuable for pioneering heterolo - gous expression studies of excitability proteins ( Lester , 1988 ) and still serve well when one desires sheer quantity rather than faithful processing , assembly , sorting , regula - tion , and targeting . However , our studies show that N2a cells more closely resemble the native neuronal environ - ment of mGAT1 . We developed a transfection protocol and uptake assay in the N2a cell line that remained in the linear range with respect to protein expression level , sub - strate concentration , and assay duration . We chose to work with the N2a cell line because its provenance closely matches that of the mGAT1 protein that we were studying : mouse and neuronal . We cannot claim perfect fidelity , but several influences on expression , oligomerization , and traf - ficking are readily reflected by changed function under these assay conditions . Conclusion We have determined standardized designs for fluores - cent transporter fusions , applied a sensitized emission pixel - by - pixel NFRET analysis method , and measured GAT1 . The trafficking deficit in mGAT1 565 XFP 566 CT also supports earlier findings that mutations of this region dominate over the presence of a class II PDZ – interacting motif at the distal C terminus ( Farhan et al . , 2004 ) . For mGAT1 570 XFP 571 CT , we suggest that moving the fluorophore more distal in the C terminus partially re - lieved the impaired trafficking of the transporters because the 565 RL 566 is preserved , allowing interaction with the COPII machinery , and the XFP is further from 562 LKQR 565 , slowing the basal internalization relative to mGAT1 565 XFP 566 CT . Nevertheless , the functional expression of mGAT1 570 XFP 571 CT at the plasma membrane is probably hampered because the fluorophore is adjacent to , and may sterically interfere with , the 568 VMI 570 motif , which specifies export from the ER – Golgi intermediate com - partment ( Farhan et al . , 2008 ) . Almost wild - type – like function ( similar K m and 78 % V max ) and strong NFRET in the periphery were achieved in the mGAT1 577 XFP 578 CT design , in which the XFP was inserted 6 residues after the 10 - residue region , rich in regulatory information for transporter trafficking ( Figs . 2 , 5 , B and C , and 10 , and Table I ) ( Farhan et al . , 2004 , 2007 , 2008 ; Holton et al . , 2005 ; Boudanova et al . , 2008 ) . We will continue to investigate the endocytosis and exocy - tosis of these constructs . The functional ( Fig . 5 , B and C ) and NFRET ( Fig . 10 ) data suggest that both mGAT1XFP8 and mGAT1 577 XFP 578 CT assemble well as mature trans - porters , and the latter construct has a small deficit in the number of transporters finally inserted into the plasma membrane . mGAT1 577 XFP 578 CT and mGAT1XFP8 dis - played similar proportions of low - , intermediate - , and high - amplitude components for peripheral ROI NFRET distributions , and this may imply similar oligomerization and interaction states for the constructs . Of these two pairs , the mGAT1 577 XFP 578 CT pair can indicate mGAT1 assembly more sensitively because the apparently nearby fluorophores have robust FRET . Value of a linear , responsive cellular assay Various cell lines and transient transfection techniques have been applied to investigate the oligomerization and trafficking of SLC6 transporters ( Melikian and Buckley , 1999 ; Schmid et al . , 2001 ; Whitworth and Quick , 2001 ; Chiu et al . , 2002 ; Torres et al . , 2003 ; Bjerggaard et al . , 2004 ; Farhan et al . , 2004 , 2007 ; Just et al . , 2004 ; Korkhov et al . , 2004 ; Holton et al . , 2005 ; Mazei - Robison and Blakely , 2005 ; Soragna et al . , 2005 ; Bartholomäus et al . , 2008 ) . In gene transfer experiments , quantitative analysis of protein func - tion can be vitiated by several mechanisms that cause a “ceiling , ” “maximum , ” “limit , ” “plateau , ” “leveling off , ” or “saturation” of measured uptake . This study’s data , as well as our laboratory’s previously reported findings , show that when mGAT1 0 GFP is transiently expressed in the widely used HEK 293T cell line , its [ 3 H ] GABA uptake appears normal despite its significant trafficking deficits in vivo ( Chiu et al . , 2002 ) . Several possible mechanisms could 516 NFRET resolves GAT1 oligomerization state and anchoring also considered because mGAT1 molecules function as monomers ; therefore , an mGAT1 oligomer might not display the approximate fourfold radial symmetry that constrains voltage - gated channels ( Scholze et al . , 2002 ; Yamashita et al . , 2005 ; Zhang and Rudnick , 2006 ) . Fig . 18 D shows a model of the apparent FRET efficiencies that would arise from populations of mGAT1 dimers , square tetramers , or rhomboid tetramers for various distances between fluorophores . To set the initial value for the closest distance between protomers r 1 , we used the LeuT Aa structure ( PDB entry 2A65A ; Yamashita et al . , 2005 ) . We assumed that the fluorophores in the mGAT1 C terminus hang directly below the substrate molecule in the protomer core . We determined the proportional values for r 2 – 4 when we varied r 1 ( Fig . 18 , A – C ) . The dimensions of the XFP barrel limit the small - est measurable distance for side - by - side chromophores in an oligomerized membrane protein to r 1 = 24 Å ( Ormö et al . , 1996 ) , and we assumed a largest value of r 1 = 100 Å . The FRET efficiency for each tetramer con - figuration for each r 1 was determined and multiplied by the probability of its occurrence to determine the ap - parent FRET , E app ( Corry et al . , 2005a ) . We also assumed that energy transfer always occurs in all possible FRET - yielding configurations ( i . e . , fluorophore bleaching or blinking was not factored into the calculations ) , with exactly equal representation of donor - and acceptor - tagged protomers in all compartments and equally effi - cient assembly of dimers and high - order oligomers . The calculations show that , relative to E app from a dimer , a square tetramer and a rhomboid tetramer have 1 . 33 - to 1 . 96 - fold and 1 . 54 - to 2 . 87 - fold higher FRET , re - spectively , as r 1 varies . For the majority of the constructs examined in this paper , the mean NFRET amplitude of the second Gaussian fit component was between 1 . 6 - and 2 . 6 - fold greater than for the lowest - amplitude first component . We discuss the width of each component to the Gauss - ian fits to the mGAT1 NFRET distributions . Consider the simple example of a single pixel in which the only oligomer type possible is a dimer . The NFRET amp - litude from that pixel is determined by the number of dimers that possess both a donor - and acceptor - tagged protomer , but the signal from these oligomers is nor - malized to the square root of the product of the pixel’s donor and acceptor fluorophore intensities . Donor - donor dimers , acceptor - acceptor dimers , and non - oligo - merized monomers can also exist in the pixel . Furthermore , immature , bleached , or misfolded XFP moieties may exist , all reducing the measured NFRET from donor - acceptor dimers ( Fig . 18 A ) . If all pixels in an ROI contain only dimers , the fit to the NFRET am - plitude distribution has a width determined by the vari - ation in the number of FRET - yielding dimers relative to the total fluorophore concentration per pixel in the ROI . Some of these statistical considerations generate a the radial distribution of NFRET amplitudes to investi - gate the basic and high - order oligomerization and pe - ripheral interactions of the mGAT1 transporter . Each of these important events is reported as a Gaussian compo - nent of the all - pixel NFRET amplitude distribution . These techniques might also reveal the basic and high - order oligomerization of other SLC6 transporter mem - bers ( Kilic and Rudnick , 2000 ; Hastrup et al . , 2003 ; Just et al . , 2004 ; Bartholomäus et al . , 2008 ) and other multi - subunit plasma membrane proteins ( Raicu et al . , 2009 ; Son et al . , 2009 ) . Future investigations will study the dy - namic changes in the interactions of transporters with regulatory and scaffolding partners in various subcellu - lar compartments , and will examine critical events in transporter modulation , such as the recently reported substrate - mediated dissociation of transporter oligo - mers ( Chen and Reith , 2008 ) . A p p E N D I x : F R E T F O R D I M E R S A N D T E T R A M E R S We assume that the fluorescent mGAT1 constructs with the most wild - type function most accurately report the normal oligomerization properties of mGAT1 via FRET . The lowest - order oligomer is a dimer . If we assume that CFP - and YFP - tagged fluorescent mGAT1 protomers are synthesized and fold equally efficiently , in a cell trans - fected by equimolar amounts of the donor and accep - tor cDNAs , a binomial distribution of donor - donor – , donor - acceptor – , and acceptor - acceptor – tagged dimers will exist ( Fig . 18 A ) . Only 50 % of the total oligomer population , the donor - acceptor dimers , will contribute to the NFRET amplitude . This means that the experi - mentally measured NFRET amplitude for a specific pixel is not the true “pair - wise” FRET data of a single CFP - YFP pair , but is the “apparent” FRET of a specific concentration of the FRET - yielding dimers , mixed with non - FRET productive dimers , and in some organelles donor or acceptor monomers ( Raicu , 2007 ) . In oligo - mers larger than dimers , there is more than one path - way for nonradiative energy transfer ( Fig . 18 , B and C ) . The apparent FRET in each pixel is influenced by : ( a ) The number of donor - acceptor pair radii in the oligomers ( e . g . , two possible FRET radii exist in a square tetramer ; r and r 2 . ( b ) The stoichiometry of the donor and acceptor flu - orophores within each oligomer . ( c ) The relative concentration of each oligomer stoi - chiometry type . ( d ) The proportions of dimers versus higher - order oligomers that exist in the pixel . We considered two possible forms of such an mGAT1 tetramer . The square tetramer would resemble the ar - rangement of subunits in voltage - gated potassium chan - nels ( Kerschensteiner et al . , 2005 ; Miranda et al . , 2008 ) ( Fig . 18 B ) . A rhomboid organization ( Fig . 18 C ) was Moss et al . 517 distribution is fit by a single Gaussian of average amp - litude greater than that for the dimer case ; however , the full width at half - maximum exceeds that from the ROI containing only dimers . We observed throughout this work that the full width at half - maximum of the first low - amplitude NFRET component was less than for the second medium - amplitude component ( Figs . 8 H , 10 , D and H , 11 D , and 16 D ) . Given the presence of nega - tive NFRET amplitudes , we think it unwise to convert the full width at half - maximum values to coefficients of variation . Pixels are 69 nm 2 , but a pixel’s optical signal also con - tains X , Y , and Z contributions from nearby regions , as appropriate to the microscope’s point - spread function , binomial distribution ; but given the additional effects , and the transformation from nF to NFRET , we assume a Gaussian distribution . Now consider a pixel containing only mGAT1 tetra - mers . There are two major sources of variation in the NFRET amplitude : ( 1 ) the proportion of the total fluo - rophore concentration in the pixel that assembles into FRET - yielding tetramers , and ( 2 ) the relative contribu - tions of each FRET - yielding donor and acceptor fluoro - phore stoichiometry in the pixel ( Fig . 18 , B and C ) . Tetramers have more sources of variation than dimers . Therefore , for an ROI whose pixels contain only tetra - mers , and at levels of donor and acceptor fluorophores equal to that of a pure dimer population , the NFRET Figure 18 .

The signal from some or most pixels also arises from a mixed population of oligomerization states . Therefore , the NFRET amplitude is also deter - mined by the numbers of the FRET - yielding dimers and tetramers and the fluorophore stoichiometries in the tetramers . For all the pixels from an ROI containing both dimers and tetramers , the NFRET distribution is fit with two overlapping Gaussian components , one for each oligomer population . The mean amplitudes of these two components represent pixels primarily but not purely containing one oligomerization state and as a result are shifted closer together than if the NFRET signal from the ROI came from pixels that contained either pure dimers or pure tetramers . Subcomponent overlap occurs because in pixels containing a heteroge - neous population of dimers and tetramers , there are numerous possibilities where different mixtures of oligo - mer types and fluorophore stoichiometries result in the same pixel NFRET amplitude .
