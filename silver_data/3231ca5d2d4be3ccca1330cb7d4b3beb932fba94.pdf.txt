Less frequently used are joint grant proposals and patents . Many scholars believe that the use of co - authorship as the sole measure of research collaboration is insufﬁcient because collaboration between researchers might not result in co - authorship . Collaborations involve informal communication ( i . e . , conversational exchange ) between researchers . Using self - reports from 100 tenured / tenure - track faculty in the College of Engi - neering at the University of South Florida , researchers’ networks are constructed from their communication relationships and also from collaborations in three areas : joint publications , joint grant proposals , and joint patents . The data collection : ( 1 ) covers both researchers’ in - progress and completed collaborative outputs , ( 2 ) yields a rating from the researchers on the importance of a relationship to them and ( 3 ) obtains multiple types of relationship ties between researchers allowing for the comparison of multiple networks . Exponential random graph models ( ERGMs ) results show that the more communication researchers have the more likely they produce collaborative outputs . Furthermore , we ﬁnd that joint grant proposals tend to have mixed gender teams and that researchers of the same race are more likely to publish together , but those demographic attributes have no additional explanatory power regarding joint patents . © 2015 Elsevier Ltd . All rights reserved . 1 . Introduction The most frequently used output to measure research collaboration is co - authorship in scholarly publications . However , many scholars regard co - authorship to be insufﬁcient as a measure of research collaboration for three reasons : ( 1 ) not all collaborations result in co - authored publications , ( 2 ) authors might be listed in publications for purely social reasons such as ‘honorary coauthors’ , and ( 3 ) authors appearing in the same publication may not even communicate directly with each other ( Katz & Martin , 1997 ; Laudel , 2002 ; Melin & Persson , 1996 ; Pepe , 2011 ) . Other studies regarding research collaboration analyze the structure of co - inventor networks deﬁned by two patent applicants being linked if there is a patent application together by these two . However , analyzing co - inventor networks is not as widely done as analyzing co - authorship networks ( Breschi & Lissoni , 2004 ) . Finally , there are no studies , to our knowledge , that analyze the properties of networks based on joint grant proposal submissions . ∗ Corresponding author . Tel . : + 1 813 974 2269 .

Cimenler et al . / Journal of Informetrics 9 ( 2015 ) 577 – 590 Collaborations often arise from informal communication between researchers ( Bozeman & Corley , 2004 ; De Solla Price & Beaver , 1966 ; Edge , 1979 ; Hagstrom , 1975 ; Katz & Martin , 1997 ; Tijssen , 2004 ) . Therefore , many scholars make a clear distinction between a researcher’s communication ( e . g . , informal conversational exchanges ) and their collaboration ( e . g . , co - authored or joint publications ) ( Borgman & Furner , 2002 ; Melin , 2000 ; Melin & Persson , 1996 ) . Despite these aforementioned facts , the relationship between a researcher’s communication network and collaborative output networks ( e . g . , network of co - authored or joint publications , grant proposals , and patents ) is not fully addressed in the literature . Moreover , the extant literature does not address the impact of the presence of a communication tie in a researcher’s communication network on the formation of an associated tie in their collaborative output networks in the presence of some demographic attributes ( e . g . , gender , race , department afﬁliation , and spatial proximity ) . The research we report addresses this gap in knowledge . Speciﬁcally , we examine the communication network and three types of collaborative output networks constructed from self - reports from 100 tenured / tenure - track faculty in a college of engineering at a large research university . The data sets used for constructing the networks are the same as the data sets used in the study of Cimenler , Reeves , and Skvoretz ( 2014 ) . Unlike their study in which network measures obtained from the constructed networks were regressed on the researchers’ performance ( determined by the g - index ) , this study uses the relationship ties present in a researcher’s communication network and the effect of sharing the same attribute by two researchers as independent variables in a regression analysis of their collaborative output networks ties as dependent variables . Our objectives are : • To explore how the presence of a tie in the communication network changes the likelihood of forming a tie in each collaborative output network . • To investigate if the sharing of some attribute by two researchers facilitates tie formation between them across the collaborative output networks ( i . e . , the homophily hypothesis ) . 2 . Literature review and hypotheses 2 . 1 . Scientiﬁc collaboration Scientiﬁc collaboration measured by co - authorship relations is a classical subﬁeld of informetrics ( Bar - Ilan , 2008 ; Egghe , 2005 ) . Therefore , in the ﬁeld of informetrics , there are many studies devoted to researchers’ collaboration patterns by constructing collaboration networks at author level ( Bar - Ilan , 2008 ) . A science and technology ( S & T ) system , which consists of a wide range of activities ( e . g . fundamental science or scholarly activity and applied research and developmental activities mainly concentrating on creating new products and processes ) , has become a driving force over the last 20 years for economic growth and development . Therefore , scientiﬁc collaboration is accepted as one of the important attributes contributing to the performance of a S & T system ( Cimenler et al . , 2014 ; Hara , Solomon , Kim , & Sonnenwald , 2003 ; Moed , Glänzel , & Schmoch , 2004 ) . Cimenler et al . ( 2014 ) summarized that scientiﬁc collaboration provide several salient advantages : ( 1 ) “access to expertise for complex problems , new resources and , funding” ( Beaver , 2001 ; Board , 2012 ; Bukvova , 2010 ; Hale , 2012 ; Hara et al . , 2003 ; Katz & Martin , 1997 ; Melin , 2000 ; Sonnenwald , 2007 ) , ( 2 ) “increase in the participants’ visibility and recognition” ( Beaver , 2001 ; Katz & Martin , 1997 ) , ( 3 ) “rapid solutions for more encompassing problems by creating a synergetic effect among participants” ( Beaver , 2001 ; Melin & Persson , 1996 ) , ( 4 ) “decrease in the risks and possible errors made , thereby increasing accuracy of research and quality of results due to multiple viewpoints” ( Beaver , 2001 ; Bukvova , 2010 ) , ( 5 ) “growth in advancement of scientiﬁc disciplines and cross - fertilization across scientiﬁc disciplines” ( Beaver , 2001 ; Cummings & Kiesler , 2005 ) , ( 6 ) “development of the scientiﬁc knowledge and technical human capital , e . g . , participants’ formal education and training , and their social relations and network ties with other scientists” ( Bozeman & Corley , 2004 ) , and ( 7 ) “increase in the scientiﬁc productivity of individuals and their career growth” ( Bozeman & Corley , 2004 ; Fox , 1983 ; Katz & Martin , 1997 ; Lee & Bozeman , 2005 ) . Furthermore , the social dimension of scientiﬁc work ; such as informal conversational exchanges between colleagues ( Bozeman & Corley , 2004 ; Katz & Martin , 1997 ) , co - authorship relations ( Glänzel & Schubert , 2004 ; Katz & Martin , 1997 ) , jointly submitted grant proposals ( Katz & Martin , 1997 ; Rigby , 2009 ) , and co - patent applications ( Balconi , Breschi , & Lissoni , 2004 ; Breschi & Lissoni , 2004 , 2009 ; Meyer & Bhattacharya , 2004 ) is an important leading factor which leads to the above mentioned advantages of scientiﬁc collaboration ( Cimenler et al . , 2014 ) . Collaboration among scientists dates back to the 17th century ( Beaver & Rosen , 1978 ) and has become increasingly prevalent over the last two decades ( Sonnenwald , 2007 ; Wuchty , Jones , & Uzzi , 2007 ) . Sonnenwald ( 2007 ) deﬁned scientiﬁc collaboration as the interaction within a social context among two or more scientists in order to facilitate the completion of tasks with regard to a commonly shared goal . Thus , participants in the collaboration event integrate valuable knowledge from their respective domains to create new knowledge . According to this deﬁnition , collaborations must be perpetuated through social networks ( Abbasi , Altmann , & Hossain , 2011 ) . Therefore , social network analysis ( SNA ) is the method commonly used to reveal the structure of collaboration between researchers ( Friedkin , 1978 ; Hara et al . , 2003 ; Hou , Kretschmer , & Zeyuan , 2008 ; Kretschmer , 2004 ; Newman , 2001c ; Peters & Van Raan , 1991 ; Sonnenwald , 2007 ) . 2 . 2 . Relationship between researchers’ communication and collaborative outputs Co - authorship in scholarly publications is a good indicator of the S & T system performance and has the advantage that it is not only a well - documented metric but also the most tangible form of scientiﬁc collaboration . Therefore , publication O . Cimenler et al . / Journal of Informetrics 9 ( 2015 ) 577 – 590 579 authorship has been used widely in many scientiﬁc collaboration studies ( Cimenler et al . , 2014 ; Glänzel & Schubert , 2004 ; Katz & Martin , 1997 ; Melin & Persson , 1996 ; Moed et al . , 2004 ; Peters & Van Raan , 1991 ; Subramanyam , 1983 ) . For instance , the structural properties of scientiﬁc collaboration patterns was analyzed by depicting the researchers’ co - authorship networks in which two individuals were linked if their names appeared in the same scientiﬁc journal , and it has been found that the researchers’ co - authorship networks indicated a small - world network property in which most authors could be reached from other nodes by a small number of hops despite high clustering in the overall network ( Barabási et al . , 2002 ; Cimenler et al . , 2014 ; Newman , 2001a , 2001b , 2001c ) . Researchers communicate to exchange knowledge , to formulate research hypotheses that address either experimental or theoretical problems and to disseminate their results in order to obtain feedback . Communication and exchange of research results are the most fundamental social processes of science and the principle way of communicating the results is the publication process ( Fox , 1983 ) . Communication not only stimulates researchers to think about unsolved problems , and thus to come up with new ideas and solutions , but it also helps transmit the procedural knowledge to other researchers to solve the problems efﬁciently ( Cimenler et al . , 2014 ; Laudel , 2002 ) . Thus , communication is an important source of and inﬂuential factor for scientiﬁc collaboration ( Bukvova , 2010 ; Cimenler et al . , 2014 ; Glänzel , 2002 ; Hara et al . , 2003 ; Katz & Martin , 1997 ) and communication is necessary to sustain collaboration ( Cimenler et al . , 2014 ; Finholt , 2003 ; Sonnenwald , 2007 ) . Collaborations mostly begin informally and arise from informal communication between researchers , i . e . , through close personal contacts and professional network ( Bozeman & Corley , 2004 ; Cimenler et al . , 2014 ; De Solla Price & Beaver , 1966 ; Edge , 1979 ; Hagstrom , 1975 ; Katz & Martin , 1997 ; Tijssen , 2004 ) . Cimenler et al . ( 2014 ) stated that many studies make a clear distinction between researchers’ communication and collaboration , ( Borgman & Furner , 2002 ; Cimenler et al . , 2014 ; Laudel , 2002 ; Melin , 2000 ; Melin & Persson , 1996 ) . From the network point of view , Newman ( 2001b ) asserted that most people who wrote a paper together might not be genuinely acquainted with one another . Taking the assumption reported by Newman ( 2001b ) , a notable study of Pepe ( 2011 ) sought an answer for the degree of overlap between the structure of researchers’ communication network and the structure of their collaborative output network ( e . g . , co - authorship network ) using SNA . The study by Pepe ( 2011 ) can be extended into multiple networks constructed using the data collected via researchers’ self - reports ( e . g . , network of joint publications , grant proposals , and patents ) . In addition , Lee and Bozeman ( 2005 ) also reported the need to investigate whether collaboration structures of researchers really mimic communication structures of researchers . Based on the discussion so far , the following hypothesis is proposed : Hypothesis 1 . The presence of a tie in a researcher’s communication network increases the likelihood of forming a tie in their collaborative output networks , and this likelihood is greater when communication between researchers is more frequent . 2 . 3 . Relationship between researcher’ demographic attributes and collaborative outputs “Birds of a feather ﬂock together” is the proverbial expression of homophily , which is often used in the social network literature . McPherson , Smith - Lovin , and Cook ( 2001 ) deﬁned homophily as “the principle that a contact between similar people occurs at a higher rate than among dissimilar people . ” That is , it is more likely that individuals who share the same demographic attributes such as gender and race will interact with each other and form social ties ( Marsden , 1988 ; McPherson et al . , 2001 ; Reskin , McBrier , & Kmec , 1999 ) . For example , Marsden ( 1988 ) found that individuals who shared the same race were more likely to discuss important matters . Similarly , Bozeman and Corley ( 2004 ) found that female researchers were more likely to collaborate with female researchers . Spatial proximity also impacts the interaction between researchers and might increase or decrease the likelihood to collaborate . For example , researchers in a close physical proximity tend to collaborate more because of the changes in three properties of informal communication : ( 1 ) increases in the frequency of communication , ( 2 ) increases in the quality of communication , and ( 3 ) reduction of the cost of communication ( Cimenler et al . , 2014 ; Kraut & Egido , 1988 ) . Face - to - face communication facilitates the ﬂow of situated cognitive and social activities because of rapid feedback and multiple channels ( e . g . , voice , facial expression , gesture , body posture ) ( Cimenler et al . , 2014 ; Olson & Olson , 2000 ) . In addition , the use of information and communication technologies ( e . g . , audio and video conferences , mobile phones , e - mail , and social networking sites especially designed to support collaborative environment ) facilitates informal communication and helps researchers collaborate with other distant researchers appropriately ( Borgman & Furner , 2002 ; Cimenler et al . , 2014 ; Schleyer et al . , 2008 ; Sonnenwald , 2007 ) . Furthermore , given the possibility of disciplinary boundaries , the impact of a researcher’s departmental afﬁliation should also be tested for each collaborative output network ( Abbasi & Jaafari , 2013 ) . To sum up , since collaboration is related to many types of shared attributes ( Bozeman & Corley , 2004 ; Hagstrom , 1975 ) , the aforementioned four networks ( researchers’ communication network and their collaborative output networks of joint publications , grant proposals , and patents ) should be analyzed by taking into account demographic attributes of individuals such as gender , race , department afﬁliation , and spatial proximity . Then , the following hypothesis is tested : Hypothesis 2 . Researchers who share the same attributes are more likely to form a collaborative output tie than researchers who do not . 580 O . Cimenler et al . / Journal of Informetrics 9 ( 2015 ) 577 – 590 3 . Method 3 . 1 . Sample and data Since solving a scientiﬁc problem requires different complex tasks varying in uncertainty , many collaborations either do not occur or break up before becoming successful and thus , result in no formal output ( Kraut , Fish , Root , & Chalfonte , 1990 ) . It has been argued by many scholars that co - authorship alone is an insufﬁcient measure or , at best , a partial indicator of research collaborations because many cases of collaborations do not result in co - authored publications . For example , researchers can work closely together , but decide to publish their results separately due to the fact that they are from different ﬁelds and desire to produce single - author papers in their own discipline ( Cimenler et al . , 2014 ; Katz & Martin , 1997 ) . Similarly , Melin and Persson ( 1996 ) stated that despite the fact that many research collaborations ended up with co - authored publications , co - authorship was still a rough indicator of collaboration between researchers . Laudel ( 2002 ) also pointed out that a collaborator’s level of contribution would determine whether or not he / she was rewarded with a co - authorship . As stated in the study of Cimenler et al . ( 2014 ) , several studies criticized the assumption that research collaboration and co - authorship are highly correlated due to the following practices : “listing co - authors for purely social reasons” ( Bozeman & Corley , 2004 ; Hagstrom , 1975 ; Katz & Martin , 1997 ) , “listing co - authors simply by the virtue of providing material or performing a routine task” ( Bozeman & Corley , 2004 ; Katz & Martin , 1997 ; Stokes & Hartley , 1989 ) , “making the colleagues ‘honorary co - authors”’ ( Bozeman & Corley , 2004 ; Katz & Martin , 1997 ; LaFollette , 1992 ) , and “listing co - authors who did not even communicate with each other during research collaboration ( e . g . , many publications in physics and astrophysics include hundreds of authors ) ” ( Pepe , 2011 ) . Bozeman and Corley ( 2004 ) and Lee and Bozeman ( 2005 ) employed a questionnaire to collect researchers’ self - report of collaboration information . The participants were asked to make a self - report of the number of people with whom they had engaged in research collaborations within the past 12 months . This permitted the researchers to indicate which relationships were worthy of being considered as collaborations . Their method can be extended to collecting researchers’ communication and collaboration information in a social network context by employing a questionnaire where researchers identify their contacts and provide the amount of communication and collaboration with those contacts via self - reports ( Cimenler et al . , 2014 ) . The data sets used for this study are the same as the data sets used in the study of Cimenler et al . ( 2014 ) in which using a questionnaire , they surveyed the entire population of 107 researchers who held tenured or tenure - track faculty positions in the College of Engineering at the University of South Florida . The sample size was reduced to 100 researchers after excluding 7 researchers ( Cimenler et al . , 2014 ) . The breakdown of the target population in terms of gender , race , and departmental afﬁliation was as follows : 86 males and 14 females ; 35 Asian , 4 Black , 9 Hispanic , and 52 White ; and 16 Chemical and Biomedical Engineering - CBE , 19 Civil and Environmental Engineering - CEE , 17 Computer Science and Engineering - CSE , 24 Electrical Engineering - EE , 10 Industrial and Management Systems Engineering - IMSE , and 14 Mechanical Engineering - ME . It took almost 5 months ( between October 2013 and March 2014 ) to reach out to target faculty members and to ﬁnalize all responses from the participants . A total of 76 out of 100 tenured / tenure - track faculty members participated . The breakdown of the resulting sample size in terms of gender , race , and departmental afﬁliation was as follows : 68 males and 8 females ; 28 Asian , 3 Black , 5 Hispanic , and 40 White ; and 14 Chemical and Biomedical Engineering - CBE , 13 Civil and Environmental Engineering - CEE , 10 Computer Science and Engineering - CSE , 17 Electrical Engineering - EE , 10 Industrial and Management Systems Engineering - IMSE , and 12 Mechanical Engineering - ME . One potential risk in this study was the low participation rate while collecting the social network data of researchers . If the participation rate is low , it is difﬁcult to entirely depict connections between researchers , opening up the possibility that the results found in the analyses of the networks will be misleading . However , even if a particular faculty member did not ﬁll out the questionnaire , the connections to non - participants are reported by the participants . Thus , connections of non - participants can be obtained from the perspective of participants . At the end , collaboration information for the full list of researchers was obtained . In this study , information about the connections of 24 non - participants was obtained by utilizing the method explained in the study of Cimenler et al . ( 2014 ) . Four 100 × 100 matrixes were constructed from the relational data provided by the researchers : a matrix of communi - cation , joint publications , grant proposals , and patents ( Cimenler et al . , 2014 ) . For the purpose of this study , directionality of the networks is not of fundamental importance ( Cimenler et al . , 2014 ; Pepe , 2011 ) . This is because collaborative out - put networks such as co - authorship networks are analyzed as undirected in the literature . The researchers’ social network data matrixes were symmetrized by converting the patterns to the undirected edges according to the “maximum” method ( Borgatti , Everett , & Freeman , 2002 ) . 3 . 2 . Data collection The questionnaire was 2 pages long and had a total of 4 questions ( see Appendix ) and it was administered in the paper - and - pencil format to increase the response rate . The ﬁrst page included 2 questions and respondents were asked to make a self - report of the number of both in - progress and completed collaborative outputs with other researchers within the college of engineering with whom they engaged in co - authored or joint publications ( in - preparation , [ re ] submitted or rejected , and published ) , joint grant proposals ( in - preparation , declined , and funded ) , and joint patents ( rejected , submitted , and issued ) O .

The names of the researchers from 6 different departments within the college were already populated in 6 different tables in order to facilitate the thought process of the respondents . Each table had a different number of rows due to the different number of researchers in each department and had 5 columns . The ﬁrst and second columns contain researchers’ ﬁrst and last names , respectively . The third , fourth and ﬁfth columns were the columns into which the respondent put the number of total in - progress and completed joint publications , grant proposals , and patents with other researchers . Since it might be hard for the respondents to remember the exact number of their total in - progress and completed collaborative outputs with other researchers , an ordinal scale was used to facilitate the thought process of the respondents . In the scale , the scores 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 were assigned to the number of collaborative outputs of 1 to 2 , 3 to 5 , 6 to 9 , and 10 - above , respectively ( Cimenler et al . , 2014 ) . The second page included 2 questions and respondents were ﬁrst asked to report the names of researchers within the college of engineering with whom they exchanged conversations or ideas as well as the frequency of the exchange . The frequency in communication relations was assessed by a second question : ‘How frequently do you exchange conversations or ideas ? ’ and was rated based on a 6 - point Likert - type scale ( see Appendix ) . The second question refers to the ‘frequency’ dimension of tie strength 1 in the social network literature . The second page was the same as the ﬁrst page except that there was one column kept for reporting the frequency of communication next to the columns across which the researchers’ names were populated . Moreover , the respondent follows the same procedure that was followed to ﬁll out the questionnaire on the ﬁrst page . For example , a researcher scanned the names in the table , found his / her conversational partner’s name , and put a score for the frequency of communication into the cell next to the researcher’s name in a given scale . Information for the relations of both the communication ( i . e . , conversational exchange ) and collaborative outputs between researchers was asked for the last 6 years up to current study date ( between 2006 and 2012 ) . This length of time might be reasonable for reporting the relations of the collaborative outputs , but not for communication because two researchers , for example , may talk to each other frequently while they write a journal or proposal , but when they ﬁnish writing the journal article or proposal they do not talk as frequently as they talked in the past . However , the main point was to investigate to what extent the researchers were genuinely acquainted with one another on average from the self - perception perspective . In addition , the time frame , 6 years , must be the same to maintain a balanced comparison between networks constructed from the relations of both the communication and collaborative outputs ( Cimenler et al . , 2014 ) . The term “collaborate” in question 1 on the ﬁrst page ( see Appendix ) might imply to ask conversational exchange infor - mation which is already asked by question 1 on the second page ( see Appendix ) . However , question 2 following question 1 on the ﬁrst page attracts the participants’ attention to the speciﬁc types of collaborative outputs . Furthermore , question 1 on the second page is speciﬁcally asked to depict the researchers’ acquaintanceship ties ( Pepe , 2011 ) . 4 . Results 4 . 1 . Statistical and descriptive properties of networks Table 1 illustrates the different statistical and descriptive properties of the four networks . The results for the density of both binary and valued relations range from highest to lowest in the following order : the network of communication , the network of grant proposals , the network of publications , and network of patents . Since the type of the rating scale used to construct the network of communication is different from other collaborative output networks , the value of density computed for the network of communication is much higher than the value of density computed for other collaborative output networks . The results indicate that the researchers’ network of relations generating the collaborative outputs is sparser than their network of communication relations . Average geodesic distance , calculated as the average of the shortest paths between each vertex pairs , also has the same order . 1 Tie strength can be assessed by three indicators : the frequency of conversational exchange , the intensity of the conversational exchange , mutual conﬁding or level of intimacy between conversational partners ( Marsden & Campbell , 1984 ) . 582 O . Cimenler et al . / Journal of Informetrics 9 ( 2015 ) 577 – 590 Clustering coefﬁcient ( CC ) is deﬁned as “the average fraction of pairs of a person’s collaborators who have also collaborated with one another” ( Newman , 2001c ) . Clustering coefﬁcient for whole network , CC , is found by averaging the local clustering coefﬁcients of all vertices n ( Watts & Strogatz , 1998 ) . Local clustering coefﬁcient , CC i , of vertex i from vertices n is computed by dividing the number of edges among the neighbors of vertex i by maximum possible edges of the neighbors of vertex i ( Watts & Strogatz , 1998 ) . CC is calculated as CC = 1 / n (cid:2) ni = 1 CC i , where CC i is the proportion of number of edges among neighbors of vertex i to maximum possible edges of neighbors of vertex i . That is , local clustering coefﬁcient calculates the density of an ego’s neighbors , but by leaving out the ego ( Hanneman & Riddle , 2005 ) . The CC value , 0 . 534 , is higher in the researchers’ communication network than other networks : joint publications , 0 . 158 , joint grant proposals , 0 . 285 , and joint patents , 0 . 051 . Then , the results indicate that two researchers have a 53 . 4 % chance of communicating and a 15 . 8 % , 28 . 5 % , and 5 . 1 % chance of collaborating in publications , grant proposals , and patents , respectively , if they have both communicated and collaborated with a third researcher . Assortativity ( degree ) is a measure of extent to which nodes with similar degree centralities tend to attach to one another , i . e . , it is the measure of correlation in the degrees of connected nodes ( Newman , 2002 ) . There is a hypothesis that positive assortativity is a property of many socially generated networks , while negative assortativity is more prevalent in techno - logical and biological networks ( Jackson , 2008 ) . Assortativity that is greater than 0 indicates that proliﬁc authors tend to be connected with only proliﬁc researchers . Assortativity that is less than 0 indicates that more proliﬁc authors tend to be connected with less proliﬁc researchers ( Pepe , 2011 ) . The value of assortativity , − 0 . 146 , is less than 0 in the researchers’ communication network , while it is higher than 0 for the other networks : joint publications , 0 . 044 , joint grant proposals , 0 . 072 , and joint patents , 0 . 217 . The fact that the researchers’ communication network has a negative assortativity means that those with fewer communication ties tend to be connected to those with more communication ties in a core - periphery pattern . 4 . 2 . Network prediction Exponential random graph models ( ERGMs ) are used to model the probability of observing a graph y from a random set of graphs Y conditioning on various local ( or subgraph ) conﬁgurations , such as edges , triangles , reciprocated ties , k - stars , etc .

In other words , the probability of observing a graph y depends on the presence of various conﬁgurations used as independent variables in ERGM model ( Robins et al . , 2007b ) . The distribution of Y can be parameterized in the following form : P ( Y = y | X ) = exp (cid:3) (cid:2) T g ( y , X ) (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:2) , Y (cid:6) , ( 1 ) and , the above equation is the general form of the class of ERGM , where Y is the ( random ) set of relations ( edges and non - edges ) in a network , y is a particular realization of relations , X is a covariate vector ( or a matrix of attributes ) for the vertices and edges , (cid:2) is the vector of coefﬁcients corresponding to a set of various types of conﬁgurations , g ( y , X ) is a vector of network statistics corresponding to the related conﬁguration included in the model if the conﬁguration is observed in the network y , g ( y ) = 1 ; otherwise it is 0 , and (cid:3) ( (cid:2) , Y ) is a normalization constant to let the probabilities sum to 1 , and it is calculated as (cid:2) z ∈ Y exp (cid:3) (cid:2) T g ( z , X ) (cid:4) ( Goodreau et al . , 2008 ; Hunter et al . , 2008 ; Morris et al . , 2008 ; Robins et al . , 2007a ) . The ties in the network of communication can be modeled as an edge covariate that impacts the probability of the tie in the network of joint publications , grant proposals , and patents . Five separate models from simple to complex were run for the binary networks of joint publications , joint grant proposals , and joint patents as the dependent variables , and for the weighted network of communication and homophily terms ( two nodes sharing an attribute , e . g . , both female or both researchers who are collocated on the same hall ) as independent vari - ables . Tables 2a – 2c present the results . Model 1 is the simplest model that gives equal probability to all edges in the network . It is the null model known as the Bernoulli or the Erd˝os – Rényi graph ( Goodreau et al . , 2008 ) . Model 2 investigates whether a ( valued ) tie in the network of communication inﬂuences the probability of a tie in a dependent network . Attribute informa - tion can be incorporated into an ERGM ( Hunter et al . , 2008 ) . Model 3 considers the researchers’ demographic attributes such as gender , race , department afﬁliation , and spatial proximity . Model 4 considers the ties in the network of communication and attribute information . Model 5 includes other two collaborative output networks as the edge covariates . For example , Model 5 can be expressed as : P ( Y = y ) = exp (cid:3) (cid:2)L ( y ) + (cid:4)C ( z ) + r T A ( y ) + o k O ( t k ) (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:2) , Y (cid:6) , ( 2 ) where (cid:2) is the edge parameter and L ( y ) refers to the number of edges in the graph y , (cid:4) and C ( z ) refer to the edge param - eter for the network of communication and the strength of edges ( or frequency scores ) associated with the network of communication which is a graph z , respectively , r T is the vector of parameters for attributes , while A ( y ) is the vector of edge level covariates which refers to uniform homophily effect ( i . e . , individuals who share the same attribute ( denoted as O .

A ( y ) = 1 ) are more likely to form social ties than two actors who do not share ( denoted as A ( y ) = 0 ) ) for each attribute : gender 2 , race 2 , department afﬁliation 2 , and spatial proximity 3 , and O k and O ( t k ) are the edge parameter for two collaborative output networks ( where k = 1 , 2 ) other than the collaborative output network modeled as dependent network and the strength of edges ( or frequency scores ) associated with these networks , respectively . There are two main assumptions when building dyad independent ERGM models . First , the homogeneity assumes that local network conﬁgurations ( e . g . , triangles ) occur across the network homogenously , i . e . , all counted instances are equally probable ( Goodreau , Kitts , & Morris , 2009 ; Lusher , Koskinen , & Robins , 2012 , p . 36 ) . This assumption is similar to the assumption made in all general linear model techniques ( e . g . , linear regression ) in which covariate’s effect is the same for all observations ( Goodreau et al . , 2009 ; Lusher et al . , 2012 , p . 36 ) . Second , dyadic independence assumes that the probability of any tie is not dependent on the value of other ties , only on the attributes of the two actors involved , i . e . , tie variables ( Y ij , Y ji ) is treated as independent observations for each pair 2 One can think of similarity in terms of a 100 × 100 matrix in which the ( i , j ) element is dummy coded ( as 1 and 0 otherwise ) indicating that whether or not the two researchers ( i and j ) have the same attribute . 3 Four 100 × 100 spatial proximity matrixes in which rows and columns refer to researchers making up the pairs , were constructed . The ( i , j ) element of each matrixes are dummy coded ( as 1 and 0 otherwise ) whether or not two researchers’ ofﬁces are next to each other , and located in the same hallway , in the same building , and in different buildings . A dummy coded matrix indicating that researchers are located in the separate buildings was chosen as base proximity matrix . Then , the effect of the ﬁrst three proximity matrixes is evaluated relative to the effect of the base proximity matrix . 584 O .

( i , j ) of nodes ( Goodreau et al . , 2009 ; Lusher et al . , 2012 , p . 59 ) . In our study , we ﬁt ERGM models which basically includes two terms : ( 1 ) two weighted networks following dyadic independent assumption and ( 2 ) the composition of node attributes within ties . Then , our dyad - independent models can be treated as standard logistic regression models ( Goodreau et al . , 2009 ; Lusher et al . , 2012 , p . 59 ) . Since this study assumes the dyadic independence , estimation uses Maximum Likelihood Principle which estimates the value of parameters ( (cid:2) , (cid:4) , r T , o k ) and makes observing data most likely in a given model after maxi - mizing the likelihood of function Logit (cid:7) P (cid:5) Y ij = 1 | Y ijc (cid:6)(cid:8) = (cid:2) T ς [ g ( y , X ) ] ij , where Y cij is all dyads other than Y ij , and ς [ g ( y , X ) ] ij is the change in the value of network statistics g ( y , X ) when the value of Y ij is changed from 0 to 1 ( Goodreau et al . , 2009 ; Lusher et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , the calculation of normalization constant , (cid:3) ( (cid:2) , Y ) , in ERGM models assuming dyadic independence does not become as complex as the calculation of normalization constant in ERGM models assuming dyadic dependence in which the likelihood is approximated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) simulation method ( Goodreau et al . , 2009 ) . Maximum likelihood estimation technique ﬁnds a vector of parameters that makes the probability P (cid:2) ( x obs ) as large as possible , where x obs is the observed graph ( Lusher et al . , 2012 , p . 147 ) . To interpret the parameter estimate ; the logistic transform must be used because the coefﬁcients are expressed as conditional log - odds ( Hunter et al . , 2008 ; Robins et al . , 2007a ) . AIC ( Akaike Information Criterion ) is used for the comparison of ERGM models and the model with the smallest AIC is considered the best ( Goodreau et al . , 2009 ; Harris , 2013 , p . 63 ) . Model 1 is the intercept - only model . The ‘edges’ terms act as the ‘intercept’ of an ERGM model and the calculated proba - bility from the ‘edges’ coefﬁcient reveals the density of the observed network . The size of the effect ( i . e . , log odds ) , − 2 . 525 , means that the addition of any edges to the network of joint grant proposals changes the total number of edges by the prob - ability of 0 . 074 ( calculated by e − 2 . 525 / ( 1 + e − 2 . 525 ) ) . For the network of joint publications and patents , it is 0 . 040 and 0 . 007 , respectively . This tie probability applies to all partners regardless of whether they are homogeneous or heterogeneous 4 on other attributes . These probability values is the same as the density of the networks in Table 1 for binary relations . Model 2 tests if the presence of a communication tie from one researcher to another elevates the chance of collaborative output tie without considering any demographic attributes . There is a positive and signiﬁcant effect of the network of communication on all collaborative output networks . The size of the effect ( i . e . , log odds ) in all three networks are 0 . 730 for joint grant proposals , 0 . 756 for joint publications , and 0 . 713 for joint patents . These values can be transformed into odds ratios by using exponential transformation . Odds ratios are interpreted with respect to reference group for categorical variables ( Harris , 2013 ) . The resulting odd ratios are 2 . 08 ( = e 0 . 730 × 1 ) , 2 . 13 ( = e 0 . 756 × 1 ) , and 2 . 04 ( = e 0 . 713 × 1 ) . The results indicate that researchers who communicates even rarely ( i . e . , once every three months ) are twice more likely to form a collaborative output tie compared with researchers who has no communication between them . If the communication network score is the minimum ‘once every three months ( 1 ) ’ , the probability that a tie that will form in the network of joint grant proposals is 0 . 046 ( calculated by e − 3 . 753 + 0 . 730 ( 1 ) / ( 1 + e − 3 . 753 + 0 . 730 ( 1 ) ) ) , and if communication network score is the maximum ‘once a day ( 6 ) ’ , this probability in the network of joint grant proposals is 0 . 652 ( calculated by e − 3 . 753 + 0 . 730 ( 6 ) / ( 1 + e − 3 . 753 + 0 . 730 ( 6 ) ) ) . Similarly , for the minimum and maximum communication network scores , the probability of a tie that will form in the network of joint publications is 0 . 019 and 0 . 465 , respectively , and these probabilities in the network of joint patents are 0 . 003 and 0 . 101 , respectively . The results indicate that the probability of a tie in the network of joint grant proposals is 4 Two researchers differ from each other in gender , race , department afﬁliation , and spatial proximity . O . Cimenler et al . / Journal of Informetrics 9 ( 2015 ) 577 – 590 585 greater than the probability of a tie in the network of joint publications and joint patents in the presence of both rare and frequent communication . Model 3 considers only demographic attributes in addition to the ‘edge’ parameter . In the network of joint grant proposals , similarity in race and department and being next to each other vs . in different buildings but not gender signiﬁcantly elevates the chances of a tie between two researchers . Moreover , being on the same hall vs . in different buildings elevates the chance of a tie . In the network of joint publications , a tie between two researchers is signiﬁcantly more likely if they are similar on gender , race , and department , and being on the same hall vs . in different buildings . In the network of joint patents , similarity on gender and race do not matter , but similarity of department does as well as being next to each other vs . in different build - ings , being on the same hall vs . in different buildings , and being in the same building vs . in different buildings . All measures of spatial proximity are more important for joint patent activity while the pure demographic measures except department are not , whereas the pure demographic measure such as race are important for the two other types of joint work . When all signiﬁcant variables are considered , we attain the following results . For joint grant proposals as the dependent network , the probability of a tie that is homogenous by race , department , and being next to each other vs . in different buildings is 0 . 326 ( e − 3 . 212 + 0 . 352 + 1 . 324 + 0 . 808 / ( 1 + e − 3 . 212 + 0 . 352 + 1 . 324 + 0 . 808 ) ) and the probability of a tie that is homogenous by race , department , and being on the same hall vs . in different buildings is 0 . 301 ( e − 3 . 212 + 0 . 352 + 1 . 324 + 0 . 695 / ( 1 + e − 3 . 212 + 0 . 352 + 1 . 324 + 0 . 695 ) ) . For joint publications as the dependent network , the probability of a tie that is homogenous by gender , race , department , and being on the same hall vs . in different buildings is 0 . 240 . For joint patents as the dependent network , the probability of a tie that is homogenous by ( 1 ) department and being next to each other vs . in different buildings , ( 2 ) department and being on the same hall vs . in different buildings , and ( 3 ) department and being in the same building vs . in different buildings is 0 . 025 , 0 . 013 , and 0 . 017 , respectively . In the network of joint grant proposals and the network of joint publications , the probabilities of forming a tie homogenous by all signiﬁcant attributes are close to each other and it is the lowest in the network of joint patents . Model 4 tests if the presence of a communication tie from one researcher to another elevates the chance of collaborative output tie taking into account the demographic attribute effects . Having a tie in the communication network remains a strong predictor of ties in the other networks even when the effects of demographic similarity and spatial proxim - ity are taken into account . However , the effects of these latter variables change once the frequency of communication ties is taken into account . In the network of joint grant proposals , the spatial proximity effects change sign and gen - der similarity is now signiﬁcant but negatively , meaning that controlling for communication ties being the same gender depresses the chances of joint grant proposal work . In the network of joint publications , the spatial proximity effects also change sign and only race similarity remains a signiﬁcantly positive effect on tie formation controlling for com - munication ties . In the network of joint patents , only being in the same building vs . in different buildings remains a signiﬁcant enhancer of patent ties among the spatial proximity measures and being in the same department no longer has a statistically signiﬁcant impact . When statistically signiﬁcant variables are only considered the probabilities in three dependent networks for the minimum communication network score ( i . e . , once every three months ) and the maximum communication network score ( i . e . , once a day ) are as follows : ( 1 ) In the network of joint grant proposals , the proba - bility of a tie that is homogenous by gender , race , department , and being next to each other vs . in different buildings is respectively 0 . 018 ( e − 3 . 586 + 0 . 840 × ( 1 ) − 0 . 276 + 0 . 255 − 0 . 590 − 0 . 640 − 0 . 243 / ( 1 + e − 3 . 586 + 0 . 840 × ( 1 ) − 0 . 276 + 0 . 255 − 0 . 590 − 0 . 640 − 0 . 243 ) ) and 0 . 551 ( e − 3 . 586 + 0 . 840 × ( 6 ) − 0 . 276 + 0 . 255 − 0 . 590 − 0 . 640 − 0 . 243 / ( 1 + e − 3 . 586 + 0 . 840 × ( 6 ) − 0 . 276 + 0 . 255 − 0 . 590 − 0 . 640 − 0 . 243 ) ) , and the probabil - ity of a tie that is homogenous by gender , race , department , and in the same building vs . in different buildings is 0 . 027 and 0 . 646 , respectively . ( 2 ) In the network of joint publications , the probability of a tie that is homogenous by race and being next to each other vs . in different buildings is 0 . 008 and 0 . 275 , respectively . ( 3 ) In the network of joint patents , the probability of a tie that is homogenous by being in the same building vs . in different buildings is 0 . 003 and 0 . 120 , respectively . In the presence of frequent communication , the probability of forming a tie in all three networks is much greater . Similar to the model 2 results , the probability of a tie in the network of joint grant proposals is greater than the probability of a tie in the network of joint publications and joint patents in the presence of both rare and frequent communication . Finally , model 5 considers other collaborative output network effects other than the network used as the dependent variable . The pattern of effects for the pure demographic variables and the spatial proximity variables is the same as in model 4 . In the case of joint grant proposals as the dependent network , only joint publications has signiﬁcantly enhances the probability of a tie and the effect of joint patents is not signiﬁcant . In the case of joint publications and joint patents as dependent network , the effect of a communication tie remains signiﬁcantly positive but of much lower magnitude and the other collaboration types ( e . g . , joint grant proposals and joint patents in the case of joint publications as the dependent network ; joint publications and joint patents in the case of joint grant proposals as the dependent network ) have signiﬁcant positive impacts . Considering only statistically signiﬁcant variables , the probabilities in three dependent networks for the minimum communication network score ( i . e . , once every three months ) and the minimum the collabo - rative output network score ( i . e . , the score ‘1’ ) and for the maximum communication network score ( i . e . , once a day ) and the maximum collaborative output network score ( i . e . , the score ‘4’ ) are as follows : ( 1 ) In the network of joint grant pro - posals , the probability of a tie that is homogenous by gender , department , and being in the same building vs . in different buildings is 0 . 079 ( e − 3 . 573 + 0 . 753 × ( 1 ) − 0 . 381 − 0 . 644 − 0 . 277 + 1 . 670 × ( 1 ) / ( 1 + e − 3 . 573 + 0 . 753 × ( 1 ) − 0 . 381 − 0 . 644 − 0 . 277 + 1 . 670 × ( 1 ) ) ) and 0 . 998 ( e − 3 . 573 + 0 . 753 × ( 6 ) − 0 . 381 − 0 . 644 − 0 . 277 + 1 . 670 × ( 4 ) / ( 1 + e − 3 . 573 + 0 . 753 × ( 6 ) − 0 . 381 − 0 . 644 − 0 . 277 + 1 . 670 × ( 4 ) ) ) , respectively . ( 2 ) In the net - work of joint publications , the probability of a tie that is homogenous by race and being next to each other vs . in different buildings is 0 . 412 ( e − 5 . 376 + 0 . 474 × ( 1 ) + 0 . 519 − 0 . 920 + 1 . 549 × ( 1 ) + 3 . 397 × ( 1 ) / ( 1 + e − 5 . 376 + 0 . 474 × ( 1 ) + 0 . 519 − 0 . 920 + 1 . 549 × ( 1 ) + 3 . 397 × ( 1 ) ) ) and 586 O . Cimenler et al . / Journal of Informetrics 9 ( 2015 ) 577 – 590 1 ( e − 5 . 376 + 0 . 474 × ( 6 ) + 0 . 519 − 0 . 920 + 1 . 549 × ( 4 ) + 3 . 397 × ( 4 ) / ( 1 + e − 5 . 376 + 0 . 474 × ( 6 ) + 0 . 519 − 0 . 920 + 1 . 549 × ( 4 ) + 3 . 397 × ( 4 ) ) ) , respectively . ( 3 ) In the network of joint patents , the probability of a tie that is homogenous by being in the same building vs . in different buildings is 0 . 016 and 0 . 889 , respectively . The probability of forming a tie in researchers’ collaborative output networks is drastically increased when the effect of other collaborative output ties ( i . e . , number of collaborative outputs between two researchers ) is taken into consideration . 5 . Discussion Since model 5s had the lowest AIC scores , these models were chosen as the ﬁnal models ( see Tables 2a – 2c ) . Then , the following results are observed . The effect of the network of communication on all collaborative output networks is posi - tive and statistically signiﬁcant . While the other variables are held constant in the model 5s , the resulting odd ratios are in three dependent networks for the minimum communication network score ( i . e . , once every three months ) and the max - imum communication network score ( i . e . , once a day ) as follows : 2 . 12 ( = e 0 . 753 × 1 ) and 91 . 65 ( = e 0 . 753 × 6 ) for the network of joint grant proposals , 1 . 61 ( = e 0 . 474 × 1 ) and 17 . 18 ( = e 0 . 474 × 6 ) for the network of joint publications , and 1 . 25 ( = e 0 . 224 × 1 ) and 3 . 83 ( = e 0 . 224 × 6 ) for the network of joint patents . The results indicate that researchers who communicates even rarely ( i . e . , once every three months ) are 2 . 12 , 1 . 61 , and 1 . 25 times more likely to form a grant proposal , publication and patent tie , respectively ; compared with researchers who has no communication between them . Furthermore , when researchers communicates frequently ( i . e . , once a day ) the likelihood of forming a collaborative output tie is greater , even it increases drastically for grant proposal . Based on these results , Hypothesis 1 , which proposes that a communication tie from one researcher to another elevates the likelihood of forming a tie in each collaborative output network , and even this likelihood is greater when there exists frequent communication between researchers , is fully supported . Hypothesis 2 , the homophiliy hypothesis in which researchers who share the same attribute are expected to be more likely to form social ties than researchers who do not , is partially supported as discussed further on . Being of the same gender had a statistically signiﬁcant negative effect on the network of joint grant proposals , whereas the effect of gender on the network of publications was not statistically signiﬁcant . While holding other variables constant in the model researchers who shares the same gender is 1 . 46 times ( = 1 / e − 0 . 381 ) less likely to form a grant proposal tie compared with researchers who do not share , indicating that grant proposals are submitted with mixed gender teams in the college of engineering . However , this mixed - gender effect disappears when either an increasing communication between researchers or the strength of other collaborative output ties is considered . Sharing the same race attribute had a statistically signiﬁcant positive effect on the network of joint publications , whereas the effect of sharing the same race on the network of joint grant proposals was not statistically signiﬁcant . The same race researchers are 1 . 68 times ( = e 0 . 519 ) more likely to publish together , all else held constant . In other words , sharing the same race increases the chance of joint publications by 68 % . This is consistent with the ﬁnding of Freeman and Huang ( 2014 ) . However , sharing the same race does not impact the chance of joint grant proposals . Being in the same department had a statistically signiﬁcant negative effect on the network of joint grant proposals , but had no effect on the network of joint publications . While holding other variables constant in the model researchers in the same department is almost twice less likely ( 1 . 90 = 1 / e − 0 . 644 ) to form a grant proposal tie compared with researchers who are not , indicating that there is a tendency of interdepartmental collaboration among researchers in joint grant proposals . However , whether or not researchers are afﬁliated with the same department makes no difference in their joint publications . Then , it can be said that grant proposal writing bridges departments to a much greater degree than publication does . However , when either an increasing communication between researchers or the strength of other collaborative output ties is taken into account the effect of sharing the same department on joint grant proposal ties are more prominent . Additionally , there was no effect of the demographic attributes ‘gender’ , ‘race’ and ‘department’ on the network of joint patents . The effect of being in the same level of spatial proximity varies for each collaborative output network . Being in the same building had a statistically signiﬁcant negative effect on the network of joint grant proposals and researchers who are in the same building are 1 . 32 times ( = 1 / e − 0 . 277 ) less likely to collaborate for grant proposals compared with researchers who are in different buildings , all else held constant . However , this negative effect diminishes in the presence of frequent communication and repetitive joint publications . Similarly , being next to each other had a statistically signiﬁcant negative effect on the network of joint publications and researchers who are next to each other are 2 . 51 times ( = 1 / e − 0 . 920 ) less likely to collaborate for publications compared with researchers who are in different buildings , while holding other variables constant in the model . Again , this negative effect diminishes in the presence of frequent communication and repetitive joint publications . In contrast , being in the same building had a statistically positive effect on the network of joint patents . While holding other variables constant in the model this shows that researchers who are in the same building are 3 . 04 times ( = e 1 . 112 ) more likely to form a patent tie compared with researchers who are in different buildings . To summarize , being closer to each other decreases the likelihood of collaboration for publications and grant proposals , but it increases the likelihood of collaboration for patents compared with being in different buildings . The more researchers are distant to each other the more likely they collaborate for publications and grant proposals ( Borgman & Furner , 2002 ; Frenken , Hardeman , & Hoekman , 2009 ; Katz , 1994 ; Schleyer et al . , 2008 ; Sonnenwald , 2007 ) . For example , if this study was conducted to map interdisciplinary relations on a campus , the results would be highly expected that researchers from different colleges were more likely to form collaborative ties for publications and grant proposals . Then , investment for an online collaborative website for researchers will be helpful to connect distant researchers to generate more collaborative outputs between them . O . Cimenler et al . / Journal of Informetrics 9 ( 2015 ) 577 – 590 587 Furthermore , research centers in which researchers are more spatially collocated will help increase the likelihood of forming co - inventor ( i . e . , co - patent ) relations . However , we should be careful while interpreting the negative effect of being closer to each other . First , model 3 , for instance , clearly shows positive rather than negative effects of being closer to each other due to the fact that model 3 includes fewer variables . That is , the results obtained using this model are not conditional on other variables such as communication . Second , the study of Lee , Brownstein , Mills , and Kohane ( 2010 ) found that being closer to each other allowed for better collaboration , which resulted in higher quality research that tended to be cited more often . Finally , we only used physical proximity as a spatial dimension in our models , but other dimensions of proximity such as cognitive , social , organizational , and institutional should also be taken into consideration ( Frenken et al . , 2009 ) . The effect of the network of joint publications and grant proposals on each other was positive and statistically signiﬁcant . Similarly , the effect of the network of joint patents and publications on each other was positive and statistically signiﬁcant . However , the effect of the network of joint patents on the network of joint grant proposals was not statistically signiﬁcant , whereas the effect of the network of joint grant proposals on the network of joint patents was positive and statistically signiﬁcant . This might be due to a temporal order of collaborative outputs . For example , researchers ﬁrst start writing grant proposals to both obtain a publishable output and issue patent at the end . Also , joint publications and joint patents mostly occur simultaneously . Then , the case that the network of joint patents impacts the network of joint grant proposals becomes against the natural progression of collaborative outputs . 6 . Conclusion Using self - reported data collected in a college of engineering and ERGMs , this study demonstrates how and to what extent the presence of a communication tie from one researcher to another increases the likelihood of forming a collaborative output tie in researchers’ collaborative networks ( e . g . , network of joint publications , grant proposals , and patents ) taking into account certain demographic attributes ( i . e . , gender , race , department afﬁliation , and spatial proximity ) . Using ERGM in the ﬁeld of Informetrics enables practitioners and scholars not only to model the structure of researchers’ different networks but also to analyze dependency of network structures . Therefore , we think that it can be widely used for future studies in the ﬁeld of Informetrics ( Jung , Park , Wu , & Park , 2015 ) . Since the result indicates that there is an effect of researchers’ different collaborative networks on one another , the research on scientiﬁc collaboration cannot be reduced to the analysis of only co - authorship networks , as it is often assumed in many scientiﬁc collaboration studies . Additionally , it presents a data collection method that enables us not only to collect the frequency of communication between researchers but also to collect the self - report of the number of in - progress and completed collaborative outputs between researchers . The method facilitates the comparative analysis of researchers’ communication and collaborative output networks by using a richer dataset taking into account both in - progress and collaborative efforts . Collecting researchers’ collaborative output data in a self - reported way provides some indication of whether or not a tie is important in terms of their collabo - rative research efforts . In other words , the self - reported way of collecting the relations in collaborative outputs permits the researchers to assess both which connection or tie is important to them according to their own perceptions and whether or not reported contact is actually involved in research ( Cimenler et al . , 2014 ) . Furthermore , collecting relational data simul - taneously for multiple networks helps us to understand the extent to which researchers’ communication relations impact their collaboration relations from the network perspective . That is , gathering data for researchers’ informal conversational exchange ties and collaborative output ties with other researchers simultaneously helps to test the extent to which scientiﬁc collaboration is nurtured by means of informal conversational exchange ( Lee & Bozeman , 2005 ; Pepe , 2011 ) . The ﬁndings of this study offer three major implications for college and university administrations as well as for policy makers in their attempt to prosper the collaborative relationships between researchers . First , college administrations are informed regarding the extent that the social cohesion formed by interpersonal ties drives the collaboration activity that resulted in collaborative outputs . Second , collaboration is related to many types of shared attributes ( Bozeman & Corley , 2004 ; Hagstrom , 1975 ) . Then , the results of this study also have the potential to identify connections of members from similar groups . Third , this study has the potential to be generalized and applied to other colleges and disciplines , and even the university as a whole . Within a university , structural properties of these four networks across different colleges can be compared in order to help university administrations understand the collaborative environment both within colleges and across colleges . Furthermore , tracking the connections in each network between different colleges or even departments within a university can also help to examine the nature of interdisciplinary relations ( Sá , 2008 ) . For example , this can be done by adding a binary independent variable into the model which indicates whether collaborative ties between researchers are interdisciplinary or not . Thus , policy makers and administrators can be informed about the potentialities of the results found in this study , and they can interpret the results to formulate policies that will help to spur collaborative research across departmental and disciplinary boundaries . In the case of extending the study to the entire university , research performance can be determined based on collaboration relationships ( e . g . , adding other subgraph conﬁgurations into the model ) between different sizes of universities ( e . g . , size can be speciﬁed according to the number of students , employees , departments , active facilities used in research , and etc . ) . This helps allocate research money to strengthen smaller universities that aspire to engage in collaborative research . If small - sized universities have just about the same relative amount of collaboration as large - sized universities ( after capturing the in - progress collaborative relations via self - reported way ) , there will be no economies of scale in this matter ( Cimenler et al . , 2014 ; Melin & Persson , 1996 ) . 588 O . Cimenler et al . / Journal of Informetrics 9 ( 2015 ) 577 – 590 This study has two major limitations . First , there is an issue of accuracy when collecting self - reported data due to biased responses and poor memory ( Lee & Bozeman , 2005 ; Vasileiadou , 2009 ) . For example , respondents may not want to report collaborative output ties , especially joint patents , for conﬁdentiality reasons . Moreover , it is highly possible that respondents might not remember all of their collaborative output ties , therefore they enter incomplete information . A future study can be made to compare the overlaps of the networks constructed by self - reported data with the networks constructed by database information . Despite these concerns , there are many recent studies using the self - report method ( Cimenler et al . , 2014 ; Duque et al . , 2005 ; Sooryamoorthy & Shrum , 2007 ; Van Rijnsoever , Hessels , & Vandeberg , 2008 ; Ynalvez & Shrum , 2011 ) . Second , when this study is applied to other colleges and disciplines , some of these networks disappear . For example , writing joint grant proposals in a college of business is not as common as in a college of engineering . Some colleges and disciplines such as colleges of education and business have a decreased tendency to issue patents , and in some disciplines such as humanities and history , single - authored papers are more valuable than co - authored papers . Furthermore , this study can be run for other colleges of engineering in different universities ( e . g . , small - sized or large - sized , research - oriented ) to understand whether the ﬁndings of this study are more or less speciﬁc for the chosen sample .
