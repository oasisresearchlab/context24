However , cargo molecules carried by EVs to exert their functions , as well as mechanisms for their regulated release and intake , have been poorly understood . In this study , we examined the effects of endothelial cells - derived EVs on neurons suffering from oxygen - glucose deprivation ( OGD ) , which mimics neuronal ischemia - reperfusion injury in human diseases . In a human umbilical endothelial cell ( HUVEC ) – neuron coculture assay , we found that HUVECs reduced apoptosis of neurons under OGD , and this effect was compromised by GW4869 , a blocker of exosome release . Puri ﬁ ed EVs could be internalized by neurons and alleviate neuronal apoptosis under OGD . A miRNA , miR - 1290 , was highly enriched in HUVECs - derived EVs and was responsible for EV - mediated neuronal protection under OGD . Interestingly , we found that OGD enhanced intake of EVs by neurons cultured in vitro . We examined the expression of several potential receptors for EV intake and found that caveolin - 1 ( Cav - 1 ) was upregulated in OGD - treated neurons and mice suffering from middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO ) . Knock - down of Cav - 1 in neurons reduced EV intake , and canceled EV - mediated neuronal protection under OGD . HUVEC - derived EVs alleviated MCAO - induced neuronal apoptosis in vivo . These ﬁ ndings suggested that ischemia likely upregulates Cav - 1 expression in neurons to increase EV intake , which protects neurons by attenuating apoptosis via miR - 1290 . Introduction Stroke is one of the major health threats worldwide with high mortality and morbidity , leading to ~ 5 million deaths per year 1 . Rapid deprivation of oxygen and nutrients immediately after ischemia , as well as the following reperfusion damage in many cases , lead to massive necrotic and apoptotic neuronal death attributed to reduction of ATP , release of excitatory neurotransmitters , burst of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , intracellular cal - cium overload , and local in ﬂ ammation . As a consequence , these pathological insults also frequently lead to persistent disability in patients surviving a stroke 2 . Therefore , neu - ronal protection and regeneration therapies have been urgently required , however , an ef ﬁ cient way to protect neurons from cell death during and after stroke has not been satisfying so far 3 – 6 . Extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) , including microvesicles , ectosomes , exosomes , apoptotic bodies , and so on , are highly heterogeneous membranous vesicles with lipid bilayer and various cargos , and are suggested as novel mediators of intercellular communication 7 . EVs are clas - si ﬁ ed according to different standards , for instance , exo - somes or small EVs ( sEVs ) represent those with the size © The Author ( s ) 2019 OpenAccess ThisarticleislicensedunderaCreativeCommonsAttribution4 . 0InternationalLicense , whichpermitsuse , sharing , adaptation , distributionandreproduction inanymediumorformat , aslongasyougiveappropriatecredittotheoriginalauthor ( s ) andthesource , providealinktotheCreativeCommonslicense , andindicateif changesweremade .

Joseph Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association 1234567890 ( ) : , ; 1234567890 ( ) : , ; 1234567890 ( ) : , ; 1234567890 ( ) : , ; between 30 and 150 nm . Exosomes originate from endo - somes through a ceramide - and / or endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) - dependent pathway , and are secreted into various body ﬂ uids by almost all types of cells via the way of exocytosis after fusion of multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) 8 , 9 . EVs exert their functions by transmitting their cargos including proteins , nucleic acids , and lipid molecules , into recipient cells 10 – 12 . Thus , after secretion into various body ﬂ uids including blood , cerebrospinal ﬂ uid , urine , saliva , and breast milk , EVs are internalized by recipient cells by mechanisms similar to receptor – ligand interaction 13 . A panel of molecules including Flotillin - 1 ( Flot - 1 ) , caveolin ( Cav ) - 1 , Pak - 1 , Rac - 1 , and Dynamin - 2 ( Dyn - 2 ) , has been identi ﬁ ed as receptors mediating EV / exosomal intake by various types of cells 14 . After internalization through endocytosis , phagocytosis , and / or direct fusion , EVs / exosomes are able to deliver their cargos into cytosol , and thereby modify the physiological states of recipient cells 8 . As EVs can be prepared in large scale by a variety of methods , recent studies have been focused on the ther - apeutical use of EVs in different human diseases including stroke , considering their advantages in delivering bio - active molecules into brain 15 – 17 . For instance , functiona - lized EVs derived from mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) can decrease the volume of the ischemic region in the brain after ischemic stroke 18 . Moreover , EVs / exosomes have also been shown to regulate cerebral angiogenesis , neurogenesis , neuronal plasticity , and glia in the central nervous system ( CNS ) under various conditions 19 – 23 . Endothelial cells ( ECs ) consist one of the largest cell population in CNS and locate in close proximity to neu - rons and neural stem cells ( NSCs ) 24 , 25 . ECs not only form blood vessels in brain to provide nutrients to and bring metabolites away from neural cells , but also secrete bioactive molecules to regulate different cell populations in CNS by angiocrine 26 , 27 . In stroke , ECs and the relevant angiocrine functions were shown to participate in the onset , progression , and post - injury neural regeneration of the disease 28 – 30 . In recent years , roles of EVs especially exosomes secreted by ECs have been recognized as important mechanisms mediating EC – neural cell inter - actions 31 , 32 . We have shown that ECs - derived exosomes could promote self - renewal , proliferation , and suppress apoptosis of NSCs in mice 31 . However , a role and the underlying mechanisms of ECs - derived EVs in neuronal damage upon ischemia and reperfusion injury ( IRI ) have not been fully explored . In this study , we accessed this question using human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) - derived EVs . We show that EC - derived EVs could protect neurons after oxygen and glucose deprivation ( OGD ) insult in vitro and brain IRI in vivo , and this effect was likely mediated by miR - 1290 carried by EVs . Interestingly , we found that OGD treatment upregulated the expression of Cav - 1 , a receptor mediating exosomal intake , in neurons . These ﬁ ndings suggested that neurons under IRI could increase their survival by actively upregulating Cav - 1 to enhance intake of EVs / exosomes derived from ECs . Materials and methods Human tissues and mice Human umbilical cord biopsies were obtained from the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics , Xijing Hos - pital . Informed consent was obtained from individuals donating their samples . The protocols involving human samples were approved by the Ethics Committee of Xijing Hospital . C57BL / 6 male mice were maintained under speci ﬁ c pathogen - free conditions . MCAO was performed with mice of 8 - weeks - old following a standard protocol 33 . The occlusion was maintained for 60 min before starting reperfusion , and mice were maintained for 24 h before further analysis . For triphenyltetrazolium chloride ( TTC ) staining , brain slices were immersed in 2 % TTC solution ( Solarbio , Beijing , China ) for 30 min at 37 °C in dark . Pale areas were quantitatively measured . In some experiments , randomly selected mice injured by MCAO were injected intracranially with 1 μ L of EV preparations ( 5 μ g / μ L ) or PBS at the site near CA1 – CA2 of hippocampus ( AP : 2 . 0 mm , ML : 1 . 7 mm , DV : 1 . 35 mm ) of the impaired hemisphere under the navigation of a murine brain ste - reotaxic apparatus ( RWD68000 , RWD Life Sciences Co . , Ltd , Shenzhen , China ) . Both EVs and PBS were pre - labeled ( see below ) to track the injection sites . Subse - quently , mice were maintained routinely for 24 h , and brain sections were prepared for TUNEL assay . To quantify apoptosis , the injection site in each hemisphere was marked , and samples with an acceptable injection site nearing CA1 – CA2 of hippocampus were analyzed further . With the injection site as the center , a circle was made to include the CA1 – CA2 of hippocampus near the injection site ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . TUNEL + cells of CA1 – CA2 within the circle were counted and compared blindly . All experiments were approved and followed the guidelines issued by the Animal Experiment Administration Com - mittee of the Fourth Military Medical University . Cell culture Primary HUVECs were obtained from umbilical vein as described 34 . Single cell suspensions were cultured in endothelial cell medium ( ECM , Sciencell , San Diego , CA ) supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 1 % endothelial cell growth supplements ( ECGS ) , 100 U / mL penicillin , and 100 μ g / mL streptomycin in a humidi ﬁ ed atmosphere with 5 % CO 2 at 37 °C . Cells between passages 3 and 5 were used in experiments . Yue et al . Cell Death and Disease ( 2019 ) 10 : 869 Page 2 of 11 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association Primary hippocampal neurons were isolated from mouse embryos at E17 . 5 . In brief , the hippocampus was dissected and cut into pieces and minced gently . Tissues were digested in 0 . 25 % EDTA - free trypsin for 20 min at 37 °C with intermittent gentle shaking every 5 min . After removing tissue debris , cells were resuspended in Dul - beccoo ’ s modi ﬁ ed Eagle ’ s medium ( DMEM ) supple - mented with 20 % FBS and seeded in culture dishes pre - coated with poly - L - lysine ( PLL ) ( 50 μ g / mL , Sigma - Aldrich , PA ) at 37 °C for 4 h to get adherence . Subse - quently , neurons were washed with PBS to remove FBS and cultured in neurobasal medium containing 1 % Glu - tamax and 2 % B27 ( Gibco , CA ) at 37 °C in a humidi ﬁ ed 5 % CO 2 incubator . The medium was half changed at day 3 and maintained for 7 days . For OGD , the medium was removed . Cells were rinsed with PBS three times and cultured with glucose - free DMEM pre - gassed with 94 % N 2 , 1 % O 2 , and 5 % CO 2 in a low oxygen incubator ( 94 % N 2 , 1 % O 2 , and 5 % CO 2 ) at 37 °C for 1 . 5 h . Cells were then cultured in complete medium again at 37 °C in a regular incubator for 24 h . For co - culture , HUVECs were seeded in the upper chamber of a 24 - well transwell system ( pore size : 0 . 4 μ m , Corning # 353095 , NY ) and cultured up to 80 % con - ﬂ uence . HUVECs were rinsed with PBS for three times and loaded to neurons cultured in a 24 - well plate with the medium of Neurobasal , 2 % B27 , and 1 % glutamine . In some cases , neurons were pretreated by OGD . GW4869 , a blocker of exosomal secretion , was used at the con - centration of 10 μ M 35 . EV isolation and labeling EVs were isolated from HUVECs using a kit following the manufacturer ’ s protocol ( Sigma - Aldrich , Cat # , BCBT8582 ) 31 , 36 . Brie ﬂ y , HUVECs were cultured to 80 % con ﬂ uence , and the culture medium was changed into serum - free ECM with 1 % ECGS and cultured further for 72 h . The culture medium was collected and successively centrifuged at 500× g for 5 min and 3000× g for 30 min to remove cell debris . The supernatants were then ﬁ ltrated through a 0 . 22 - μ m ﬁ lter ( Millipore , CA ) , and mixed with the PEG6000 working solution to the ﬁ nal concentration of 12 % PEG6000 . The mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 12 h followed by centrifuging at 12 , 000× g for 1 h . The supernatants were discarded completely , and pellets were resuspended in PBS and washed with PBS twice . EVs was quanti ﬁ ed using the microtiter plate BCA assay ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c Scienti ﬁ c , Waltham , MA ) according to the provided protocol . The size of EVs was determined using ZETASIZER Nano series - Nano - ZS ( Malvern , England , UK ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) 31 . For labeling , EVs in PBS were mixed with DiI ( Molecular Probes , MA ) at a concentration of 20 μ M and incubated at room temperature for 20 min . The mixtures were then centrifuged at 12 , 000× g for 30 min and washed with PBS for three times . For PKH - 67 labeling , PKH - 67 ( BestBio , Shanghai , China ) were diluted 10 times by diluent and then diluted 25 times by EV samples in PBS . After incu - bated at 4 °C for 15 min , the mixture was used for the injection . For incubation with cultured neurons , puri ﬁ ed EVs were resuspended in complete neuronal medium to the ﬁ nal concentration of 10 μ g / μ L . The mixtures were loaded to cultured neurons and incubated for 12 h . Cells were rinsed with PBS , and cultured routinely in neuronal medium further . Immuno ﬂ uorescence staining Cells were ﬁ xed by 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) and rinsed with PBS for three times , followed by permeabili - zation with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 for 10 min . Samples were blocked by 1 % BSA for 30 min and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C . Cells were then incubated with Dylight 488 - conjugated or Dylight 594 - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Genetex , Alton , CA ) or for 1 h . Washing with PBS was performed between each staining steps . Nuclei were counter - stained with Hoechst for 5 min . Cells were observed under a ﬂ uorescence microscope ( BX51 , Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) . For imaging , the transparent observation chamber was sterilized , pre - gassed with humidi ﬁ ed mixed gas ( 5 % CO 2 ) , and pre - heated to 37 °C . Neurons were incubated with DiI - labeled EVs for 30 min , and distributed in the observation chamber . Cell images were recorded under a ﬂ uorescence microscope ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) for 12 h . Cell death assays Apoptosis was detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase - mediated dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) with the DeanEnd TM Fluorometric TUNEL System kit ( Promega , WI ) following the manu - facturer ’ s instructions . In brief , neurons were seeded on PLL - coated glass coverslips . Cells were rinsed with PBS for three times , ﬁ xed with 4 % PFA for 15 min and per - meabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 and 0 . 1 % sodium citrate solution . Cells were then equilibrated for 10 min at room temperature in the equilibration buffer and incu - bated with a working solution consisting of ﬂ uorescein - labeled nucleotide mix and terminal deoxynucleotidyl - transferase for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidi ﬁ ed dark chamber . The reaction was ended by adding 2 × SSC solution . Nuclei were stained with Hoechst for 5 min . The cover - slips were mounted with 75 % glycerol / PBS and observed under a ﬂ uorescence microscope ( Ti - E , Nikon ) . Release of lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) in culture supernatant was determined with a kit ( Beyotime , Shanghai , China ) . The activity of LDH was estimated by measuring absorbance at 490 nm using a microplate reader . Yue et al .

The levels of miRNA and mRNA were normalized with U6 ( 5 ′ - G GAACGATACAGAGAAGATTAGC and 5 ′ - TGGAAC GCTTCACGAATTTGCG ) and β - actin ( 5 ′ - CATCCGT AAAGACCTCTATGCCAAC and 5 ′ - ATGGAGCCACCG ATCCACA ) , respectively . Western blotting Cells and EVs were lysed with working solution of the RIPA buffer ( Beyotime ) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate – 12 % polyacrylamide gel ( SDS – PAGE ) electrophoresis and blotted onto polyvinylidene ﬂ uoride ( PVDF ) membranes ( Millipore ) . Membranes were incu - bated with PBST ( PBS and 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ) containing 5 % skim milk for 1 h , and successively incubated with pri - mary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and secondary anti - bodies for 1 h at room temperature . Membranes were developed using an enhanced chemoluminescence ( ECL ) system ( Clinx Science Instruments , Shanghai , China ) .

P < 0 . 05 was considered as signi ﬁ cant . Results HUVECs - derived exosomes protected neurons from oxygen - glucose depletion ( OGD ) injury To test the role of EVs in EC - mediated neuronal pro - tection , we set up a coculture system of HUVECs and primary hippocampal neurons treated by OGD in the absence or presence of GW4869 , a neutral sphingomyeli - nase inhibitor that blocks the secretion of exosomes 35 ( Fig . 1a ) . The blocking ef ﬁ ciency of GW4869 was con - ﬁ rmed by isolation of EVs followed by Western blotting ( Fig . 1b ) . The result showed that OGD led to an increase of neuronal apoptosis , which was ameliorated by coculture with HUVECs . However , the protection effect of HUVECs was reduced by the addition of GW4869 ( Fig . 1c , d ) , suggesting that HUVECs - mediated neuronal protection was likely via the secretion of exosomes , a kind of EVs . To further investigate the effects of HUVECs - derived EVs on neurons , we isolated EVs from culture super - natant of HUVECs . HUVECs - derived EVs were vesicles of around 100 nm in size with a bilayer structure ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Western blotting showed that EV markers including CD63 , CD9 , and ALIX were enriched in the EV pre - parations , but the negative markers VDAC1 , calreticulin and lamin A / C were hardly detectable ( Fig . 2c ) . We then incubated primary hippocampal neurons with HUVECs - derived EVs for 12 h . Neurons could ef ﬁ ciently intake DiI - labeled EVs in both cell bodies and neuronal processes ( Fig . 2d ) . Then , primary hippocampal neurons were treated with OGD and incubated with HUVECs - derived EVs for 12 h . TUNEL staining showed that incubation with EVs could reduce neuronal apoptosis after OGD ( Fig . 2e ) . Moreover , the levels of intracellular - activated caspase 3 and LDH release also decreased in OGD - treated neurons incubated with EVs ( Fig . 2f , g ) . These results indicated that EVs from ECs attenuated neuronal apop - tosis induced by OGD . Yue et al .

Cell Death and Disease ( 2019 ) 10 : 869 Page 5 of 11 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association miR - 1290 carried by HUVECs - derived EVs protected OGD - insulted neurons EVs exert their biological functions through delivering cargos they carry . To discover the mechanism of the anti - apoptosis role of HUVECs - derived EVs , we performed data - mining of sequencing data deposited in miRwalk , miRanda , Targetscan , and miR22 database for ECs - derived EVs miRNAs related with apoptosis . ( ) Ten miRNAs were picked up as candidates based on these standards , and qRT - PCR showed that hsa - miR - 1246 and hsa - miR - 1290 were highly enriched in HUVECs - derived EVs ( Fig . 3a , b ) . We then transfected primary neurons with miRNA mimics of hsa - miR - 1246 and hsa - miR - 1290 and determined apoptosis by TUNEL . Quantitative ana - lysis showed that overexpression of miR - 1246 or miR - 1290 attenuated apoptosis in neurons suffering from OGD ( Fig . 3c , d ) . However , examining LDH release and aCsp - 3 level using LDH activity assay and Western blot - ting , respectively , showed that miR - 1290 signi ﬁ cantly reduced death of OGD - treated neurons , but miR - 1246 had marginal activity without statistical signi ﬁ cance ( Fig . 3e , f ) . These data suggested that HUVECs - derived Fig . 3 miR - 1290 and miR - 1246 in HUVECs - derived EVs exhibited protective effect on OGD - treated neurons . a EC - derived and apoptosis - related miRNAs in literatures were screened and illustrated with a Venn plot . b The levels of 10 miRNAs in a were determined in EVs derived from HUVECs . c , d Primary neurons were treated by OGD and incubated with control oligos ( NC ) or mimics of miR - 1246 and miR - 1290 .

Cell Death and Disease ( 2019 ) 10 : 869 Page 6 of 11 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association EVs protected OGD - treated neurons most likely through miR - 1290 , although the effect of miR - 1246 could not be completely excluded . OGD treatment enhanced EV intake by neurons Next , to evaluate the dynamics of EV intake by neurons , we labeled HUVECs - derived EVs with DiI , and incubated primary neurons with DiI - labeled EVs for different peri - ods of time . Live cell imaging showed that neurons could take in a signi ﬁ cant amount of DiI - EVs as early as 1 h after incubation , and EV intake appeared reaching its max - imum at about 3 h after incubation ( Fig . 4a ) . Interestingly , quanti ﬁ cation of intracellular ﬂ uorescence signal showed that OGD treatment enhanced intake of DiI - labeled EVs by neurons ( Fig . 4b ) . Consistently , the level of miR - 1290 was signi ﬁ cantly higher in neurons incubated with HUVECs - derived EVs after OGD - treatment ( Fig . 4c ) . A similar tendency was observed in miR - 1246 ( Supple - mentary Fig . S2 ) . These data suggested that OGD - treated neurons could enhance intake of EVs , which likely serves as a mechanism to increase their survival under stress environment . Cav - 1 was signi ﬁ cantly upregulated in neurons after OGD in vitro and in vivo We then tried to further assess the molecular mechanism for increased EV intake by neurons after OGD . Several molecules of the endocytosis pathway including Flot - 1 , Cav - 1 , Pak - 1 , Rac - 1 , and Dyn - 2 have been implicated in exosomal intake in various types of cells 14 , 38 . Total RNA was prepared from primary neurons suffered from OGD . qRT - PCR showed that OGD treat - ment signi ﬁ cantly upregulated Cav - 1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Immuno - ﬂ uorescence con ﬁ rmed that OGD treatment induced the expression of Cav - 1 in neurons ( Fig . 5c ) . The expression of other exosomal intake - related molecules including Flot - 1 , Pak - 1 , Rac - 1 , and Dyn - 2 was not in ﬂ uenced by OGD as determined by qRT - PCR ( Fig . 5a ) . Furthermore , we established MCAO - reperfusion model in mice ( Fig . 5d ) . Western blotting indicated that Cav - 1 was predominantly upregulated in the injured cerebral hemi - sphere ( Fig . 5e ) . These ﬁ ndings suggested that Cav - 1 was upregulated after IRI in neurons , which could be responsible for increased EV intake by neurons . Fig . 4 OGD - treated neurons displayed enhanced internalization of EVs derived from HUVECs . a HUVECs - derived EVs were labeled with DiI , and incubated with primary neurons . The internalization of DiI - EVs was recorded by live imaging , and shown at 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 h . b DiI - EVs were incubated with neurons from control group or OGD group for 12 h and observed under a ﬂ uorescence microscope . The mean ﬂ uorescence intensity ( MFI ) was determined to compare the difference of ﬂ uorescence intensity between the two groups ( n = 3 ) . c The level of miR - 1290 in neurons incubated with HUVECs - derived EVs for 3 or 12 h was determined ( n = 6 ) .

Cell Death and Disease ( 2019 ) 10 : 869 Page 7 of 11 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association Cav - 1 - mediated EV intake through Cav - 1 - dependent endocytosis pathway To determine whether Cav - 1 was involved in EV intake in OGD - treated neurons , siRNAs to Cav - 1 were synthe - sized , which could suppress Cav - 1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels in neurons after transfection ( Fig . 6a , b ) . Then , primary neurons transfected with Cav - 1 siRNA or control were treated with OGD and incubated with DiI - labeled EVs derived from HUVECs . We found that transfection of Cav - 1 siRNA resulted in obvious reduction of DiI - EVs in neurons as determined by MFI ( Fig . 6c ) . The level of EV - enriched miR - 1290 was also signi ﬁ cantly lower in neurons transfected with si - Cav - 1 compared with those transfected with the control siRNA ( Fig . 6d ) . Moreover , OGD - induced apoptosis , which was attenuated by incubation with HUVECs - derived EVs , was restored in the presence of Cav - 1 siRNAs ( Fig . 6e – g ) . These results suggested that neurons under IRI could increase their survival by upregulating Cav - 1 to enhance intake of EVs derived from ECs . Lastly , we injected HUVEC - derived EVs directly into brain tissues of mice injured by MCAO . TUNEL staining showed that HUVEC - derived EVs could attenuate apoptosis in MCAO - injured brain tissues ( Fig . 6h ; Supplementary Fig . S1 ) , suggesting that EC - derived EVs could serve as a promising therapy for IRI in brain . Discussion EVs have exhibited promising therapeutic potentials in the treatment of stroke , and a panel of clinical trials have been reported 18 , 32 , 39 – 41 . Moreover , studies have also indicated that functionally modi ﬁ ed EVs could be utilized to deliver drugs and speci ﬁ cally target neural cell 18 , 42 . So far , EVs derived from various cell types such as MSCs have been suggested to potentially bene ﬁ t patients by different mechanisms including reduction of edema , immunomodulation , and promoting neurogenesis , and angiogenesis 37 , 38 , 43 – 45 . ECs regulate tissue homeostasis and participate in tissue injury and regeneration through angiocrine . It has been shown that BDNF , NGF , and VEGF secreted by ECs could promote neuronal survival and angiogenesis 24 , 28 , 46 . ECs - derived EVs , which repre - sent a novel type of angiocrine , have been shown to be protective in various human diseases such as cardiovas - cular diseases 47 . Atherosclerotic conditions could pro - mote the package of miR - 92a - 3p into endothelial Fig . 5 Cav - 1 was signi ﬁ cantly upregulated in neurons upon OGD treatment . a Primary neurons were treated with OGD for 1 . 5 h and incubated with HUVECs - derived EVs for 3 or 12 h .

We have recently demonstrated that ECs - derived EVs protect NSCs from apoptosis and promotes stemness 31 . In this study , we further extend our observation to primary hippocampal neurons under OGD , which mimics IRI in stroke . Our data showed that cultured neurons could ef ﬁ ciently internalize EVs , and ECs - derived EVs attenuate apoptosis in neurons under OGD . Therefore , ECs - derived EVs could play protective roles in different stages of stroke , namely protect neurons from cell death and pro - mote regeneration by increasing survival and activity of NSCs . Considering that ECs could be relatively easily cultured ex vivo , these properties of ECs - derived EVs make them attractive candidates as a tool for therapy of stroke . Interestingly , internalized EVs are localized at both cell body and processes of neurons . EVs have been proved to be transported from a neuron to the next one through axon by hijacking the endosomal system 49 . In our con - dition , whether this characteristic intracellular distribu - tion pattern re ﬂ ects different effects of EVs on neurons requires further investigation . Although different components of EVs including pro - teins , RNAs , and lipids have been implicated in their functions , a large amount of studies have pointed to that miRNAs may play a critical role in transmitting signals by EVs between cells under many different experimental settings 38 , 39 , 47 , 50 – 52 . Xin et al . showed that miRNA miR - 17 - 92 cluster in exosomes enhance neuroplasticity and functional recovery after stroke in rats . It has also been shown that MVP - mediated exosomal sorting of miR - 193a Fig . 6 Cav - 1 was responsible for increased internalization of HUVECs - derived EVs by neurons treated by OGD . a Neurons were transfected with three different siRNAs targeting Cav - 1 . The mRNA level of Cav - 1 was determined by qRT - PCR . b The ef ﬁ ciency of si - Cav - 1 and si - Cav - 3 was further con ﬁ rmed by Western blotting . c , d Primary neurons were transfected with si - NC , si - Cav - 1 , or si - Cav - 3 , and treated with OGD and incubated with HUVECs - derived EVs for 12 h . Cells were observed under a ﬂ uorescence microscope , and the mean ﬂ uorescence intensity of DiI - labeled EVs in neurons was measured c . miR - 1290 was determined in different groups d . e – g Knockdown of Cav - 1 abrogated EVs - mediated neuronal protection in OGD , as determined by aCasp - 3 Western blotting e , TUNEL f , and LDH release g . h Male mice of 6 – 8 weeks old were injured by MCAO . Immediately after the MCAO operation , mice were injected intracranially with 1 μ L of pKH67 - PBS or pKH67 - sEVs at the site adjacent to the hippocampus of the impaired hemisphere under the navigation of a murine brain stereotaxic apparatus . The brain samples were sectioned and stained routinely , photographed under a ﬂ uorescence microscope , and apoptotic cells of CA1 – CA2 were quantitatively compared according to Supplementary Fig . S1 . The injection regions that were too far or too close to the hippocampus were excluded from analysis ( n = 5 for PBS and n = 6 for EVs ) .

Cell Death and Disease ( 2019 ) 10 : 869 Page 9 of 11 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association promotes colon cancer progression 50 , 52 . ECs - derived EVs contain many different types of miRNAs 8 . By bio - informatic mining of published data , we identi ﬁ ed two apoptosis - related miRNAs , miR - 1246 and miR - 1290 , were enriched in EC - derived EVs . Further molecular char - acterization has shown that miR - 1290 can attenuate apoptosis of primary neurons treated by OGD , although miR - 1246 also exhibited similar effect but at a weaker strength as compared with miR - 1290 . Both miR - 1290 and miR - 1246 have been implicated in regulating cancer cell proliferation and migration , and exosomal miR - 1290 and miR - 1246 might serve as tumor biomarkers 53 – 57 . Our data have shown that these two miRNAs are highly enriched in ECs - derived EVs , supporting a neuronal protective role of ECs - derived EVs in stroke . However , our data do not completely exclude the contribution of other EV components in EV - mediated neuronal protec - tion . The contribution of components , such as lipids , proteins , and mRNAs , in EVs to neuronal survival is worth of further investigation . It is interesting that OGD treatment increased exosomal intake by neurons . This ﬁ nding suggests that neurons under stress , such as IRI in this study , could actively confront the insults or release stress by increasing intake of EVs from their microenvironment . EVs enter recipient cells through direct fusion , receptor - dependent endocy - tosis and phagocytosis 9 . In our study , we identi ﬁ ed Cav - 1 as a neuronal receptor for intake of ECs - derived EVs , and OGD treatment upregulates Cav - 1 expression in neurons . Knockdown of Cav - 1 could reduce neuronal intake of EVs and overwhelm EVs - mediated neuronal protection in OGD . It has been reported that the interference of endocytosis - related molecules , such as Cav - 1 and Dyn - 2 could disturb the internalization of EVs 14 , 38 . Moreover , Cav - 1 has been shown to be protective in stroke . Cav - 1 de ﬁ ciency increases cerebral ischemic injury , and regula - tion of Cav - 1 expression determines early brain edema after experimental focal cerebral ischemia 58 , 59 . Choi et al . reported that overexpression of Cav - 1 attenuates brain edema by inhibiting tight junction degradation 59 . In addition , Cav - 1 may also participate in neural protection via N - methyl - Daspartate receptor - mediated Src and extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 / 2 activation 60 . Our data put forward a novel mechanism of Cav - 1 - mediated neuronal protection , namely Cav - 1 play its neuronal protective role through mediating exosomal intake in ischemic injury . These ﬁ ndings provide further support for therapeutic use of EVs in the treatment of stroke .
