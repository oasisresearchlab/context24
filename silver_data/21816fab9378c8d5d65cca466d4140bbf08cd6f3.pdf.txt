458 comment Combating COVID - 19 : health equity matters COVID - 19 has affected vulnerable populations disproportionately across China and the world . Solid social and scientific evidence to tackle health inequity in the current COVID - 19 pandemic is in urgent need . Zhicheng Wang and Kun Tang T he outbreak of the respiratory disease COVID - 19 in China has caused global concern 1 . By 24 February 2020 , the number of confirmed infections nationwide had reached 77 , 658 , of which 64 , 786 were in Hubei province ( with 47 , 071 in Wuhan city ) . The Chinese government’s massive lockdown and travel - restriction measures have already seen preliminary effects 2 . However , the overstretch of the health system’s capacity within the epicenter , especially in Wuhan city , has already led to a large discrepancy in the case - fatality rate in Hubei province ( 3 . 96 % ) , which is about 5 times that of other provinces in China ( 0 . 79 % ) and 3 . 6 times that of the rest of the world ( 1 . 11 % ) 3 , 4 . Developing an equitable health system is at the core of the principles and goals of the Healthy China 2030 plan and the Sustainable Development Goals 5 , 6 . The global efforts to contain the epidemic cannot ignore health equity , especially at the epicenter , where the outbreak is still ongoing . Ensuring equal treatment opportunities for all is key to winning this battle . Financial protection during outbreak matters . At the initial stage of the COVID - 19 epidemic , out - of - pocket expenditure posed a substantial financial burden for the poor populations with severe symptoms , even for those under coverage by the social health insurance scheme . On 22 January 2020 , after realizing the severity of the outbreak , the National Healthcare Security Administration and Ministry of Finance immediately issued a notice to guarantee that the out - of - pocket medical expenses of all patients confirmed to have COVID - 19 would be subsidized by the government , and this policy was later extended to all suspected cases 7 . The removal of catastrophic medical expenditures cleared the financial barriers for patients with both confirmed and suspected cases of COVID - 19 to seek medical treatment right away while also protecting them from being impoverished by the infection . However , perhaps more importantly , it ensured that the disease - control efforts reached out to the most marginalized and vulnerable people to contain the spread of the causative coronavirus . However , financial protection is only one aspect of achieving health equity during this outbreak . The overloaded clinical capacity , although supplemented with thousands of health workers from other provinces , could not meet the demand of COVID - 19 screening and treatment at the initial stage of the epidemic in Wuhan city . Many patients with COVID - 19 symptoms posted ‘Help me’ messages through social media , seeking treatment opportunities . Social media can be a useful channel for those with good internet literacy , but for those who have no access to the internet , especially among the elderly , the chance of being hospitalized was slim . After the lockdown of Wuhan city and Hubei province , people with suspected COVID - 19 were ordered to self - quarantine at home , awaiting hospitalization . This situation resembles the Chicago heat wave in 1995 , during which those who lived alone or had little social capital were more likely to die from the disaster 8 . In addition , timely treatment also depends on the effective operation of communities . The lack of community capacity and mobilization in the deprived regions may be another key bottleneck to providing timely assistance to patients and the affected families , as was seen in the H1N1 influenza epidemic in the USA 9 . This may also explain the disproportionally high level of morbidity and mortality in particular cities and provinces , in contrast to that in other parts of China . Apart from the immediate health effects for the vulnerable populations , the epidemic will inevitably have long - term socioeconomic impacts on both the people infected and the communities in which they live . The outbreak of cholera in London in 1854 , for example , is still believed to exert negative economic consequences on neighborhoods and the city 10 . The livelihoods of the vulnerable groups living in deprived areas are severely affected by the epidemic . The decrease in income will in turn harm their future health 11 . If this vicious cycle is not broken , the problems of local health inequity in the epidemic areas will remain or could even be exacerbated . Solid evidence for tackling health inequities during the COVID - 19 outbreak is in urgent need . The scarcity of health - equity assessment during the current outbreak will halve the disease - control efforts . In the future , we suggest adopting a stronger and more rapid social - science approach in support of research on the ‘social autopsy’ of the COVID - 19 outbreak 12 . We believe health equity should be at the center of all policies designed to strengthen China’s health system and emergency responses during the current epidemics and other public - health crises in the future . ❐ Zhicheng Wang and Kun Tang ✉ Research Center for Public Health , School of Medicine , Tsinghua University , Beijing , China . ✉ e - mail : tangk @ mail . tsinghua . edu . cn Published online : 26 March 2020 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41591 - 020 - 0823 - 6 References 1 .
