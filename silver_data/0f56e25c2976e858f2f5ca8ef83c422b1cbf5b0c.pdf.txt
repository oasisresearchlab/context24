A nanobody - based molecular toolkit provides new mechanistic insight into clathrin - coat initiation Linton M Traub * Department of Cell Biology , School of Medicine , University of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh , United States Abstract Besides AP - 2 and clathrin triskelia , clathrin coat inception depends on a group of early - arriving proteins including Fcho1 / 2 and Eps15 / R . Using genome - edited cells , we described the role of the unstructured Fcho linker in stable AP - 2 membrane deposition . Here , expanding this strategy in combination with a new set of llama nanobodies against EPS15 shows an FCHO1 / 2 – EPS15 / R partnership plays a decisive role in coat initiation . A nanobody containing an Asn - Pro - Phe peptide within the complementarity - determining region 3 loop is a function - blocking pseudoligand for tandem EPS15 / R EH domains . Yet , in living cells , EH domains gathered at clathrin - coated structures are poorly accessible , indicating residence by endogenous NPF - bearing partners . Forcibly sequestering cytosolic EPS15 in genome - edited cells with nanobodies tethered to early endosomes or mitochondria changes the subcellular location and availability of EPS15 . This combined approach has strong effects on clathrin coat structure and function by dictating the stability of AP - 2 assemblies at the plasma membrane .

The process depends on the deposition of an ordered precession of cytosolic coat components at a small , flat , demarcated zone of the plasma membrane destined to transform morphologically into a spherical clathrin - coated vesicle ( Avinoam et al . , 2015 ; Bucher et al . , 2018 ) . Generally , the local assembly of the organized coat coordinates the process of membrane deformation into an invaginated bud with the recognition and capture of transmembrane cargo ( Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ; Mettlen et al . , 2018 ) . To properly build the coat , a succession of discrete coat proteins display different kinetics of arrival and depar - ture ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) , and can be differentially positioned within the assembling polyhedral cla - thrin lattice ( Sochacki et al . , 2017 ; Ma et al . , 2016 ) that is emblematic of this type of intracellular transport vesicle coat . The so - called pioneer proteins ( Ma et al . , 2016 ; Traub and Wendland , 2010 ) , which arrive first to define and arrange the incipient bud site , include epidermal growth fac - tor receptor pathway substrate 15 ( Eps15 ) , the core heterotetrameric clathrin adaptor AP - 2 , and FCH / F - BAR domain only protein 1 ( Fcho1 ) and Fcho2 ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Eps15 is a fibrous ( > 30 nm ) protein oligomer ( Tebar et al . , 1997 ; Cupers et al . , 1997 ) , originally identified as a tyrosine phosphorylated substrate of the activated EGF receptor , hence the designation Eps15 ( Fazioli et al . , 1993 ) . Yet even in the absence of EGF receptor activation , Eps15 localizes to the vast majority of cell surface clathrin - coated structures at steady state ( van Delft et al . , 1997a ; Benmerah et al . , 1999 ; Tebar et al . , 1996 ) , is positioned predominantly at the margins of assem - bling lattices ( Sochacki et al . , 2017 ; Tebar et al . , 1996 ; Henne et al . , 2010 ; Edeling et al . , 2006 ) , and is among the first assembled coat proteins encountered by an activated G protein - coupled Traub . eLife 2019 ; 8 : e41768 .

A large multi - domain protein , Eps15 binds physically to numerous other coat components , includ - ing AP - 2 ( Edeling et al . , 2006 ; Benmerah et al . , 1996 ; Traub et al . , 1999 ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) , Fcho1 / 2 ( Henne et al . , 2010 ; Reider et al . , 2009 ; Uezu et al . , 2011 ; Umasankar et al . , 2012 ) , Dis - abled - 2 ( Dab2 ) ( Teckchandani et al . , 2012 ) , epsin 1 ( Chen et al . , 1998 ; McPherson et al . , 1998 ) , HIV - 1 Rev - binding protein ( Hrb ) ( Doria et al . , 1999 ; Whitehead et al . , 1999 ; Yamabhai et al . , 1998 ) , Numb ( Santolini et al . , 2000 ; Evergren et al . , 2018 ) , stonin 2 ( Rumpf et al . , 2008 ) , and syn - aptojanin 1 ( McPherson et al . , 1998 ; Haffner et al . , 1997 ) , among other proteins including ubiqui - tin ( Hofmann and Falquet , 2001 ) . Because of this multiplicity of protein – protein contacts , residence of Eps15 at clathrin bud sites is not solely dependent on AP - 2 ( van Delft et al . , 1997a ) . While much is known about the biology of Eps15 ( Teckchandani et al . , 2012 ; van Bergen En Henegouwen , 2009 ; Milesi et al . , 2019 ) , several aspects of its operation still remain opaque , including how the multiple synchronous protein – protein interactions might be prioritized and regulated , how asymmet - ric partitioning within a clathrin - coated structure is achieved , and how post - translational modifica - tions , including phosphotyrosine addition ( Torrisi et al . , 1999 ) and ubiquitination ( Polo et al . , 2002 ; van Delft et al . , 1997b ; Francavilla et al . , 2016 ) , impact Eps15 operation and stability . Numerous complimentary experimental approaches are available in contemporary cell biology to probe the structure , location and function of individual gene products . Most notably , genome - edit - ing technology provides an unparalleled ability to disrupt or modify gene products in a cellular set - ting ( Smith et al . , 2017 ; Housden et al . , 2017 ) . Transcription activator - like effector nuclease ( TALEN ) - mediated genome editing is used here to silence the EPS15R - encoding EPS15L1 locus in a HeLa cell line that also lacks the expression of the pioneer proteins FCHO1 and FCHO2 ( Umasankar et al . , 2014 ) . Other technically useful current tools for biochemical and cellular analyses are single chain nanobodies ( Nbs ) derived from Camelidae species ( Beghein and Gettemans , 2017 ; Wang et al . , 2016a ) . Since the variable heavy - chain domain from heavy chain antibodies ( V H H ) encoded by Nbs is only a single , stably folded , compact chain of ~ 13 kDa , they are easy to subclone , express and transfect ( Moutel et al . , 2016 ; Dmitriev et al . , 2016 ) . They are further versatile as the smallest , autonomous native antigen - binding fold in that ectopically expressed monomeric V H H frag - ments often remain operational in the reduced cytosolic environment ( Moutel et al . , 2016 ; Pleiner et al . , 2015 ; Schenck et al . , 2017 ) . Here , a set of anti - Eps15 Nbs is characterized biochemi - cally and an assortment of Nb - based fusion proteins for cell - based analysis evaluated . Results Identification of anti - EPS15 EH domain Nbs A phage - based immune llama ( Lama glama ) V H H library , raised against residues 1 – 314 of the Homo sapiens ( Hs ) EPS15 protein from chromosome 1 ( Wong et al . , 1994 ) , was generated and screened . As Nbs preferentially recognize folded conformational antigens over linear or peptide regions , the immunizing antigen corresponds to three consecutively - arrayed Ca 2 + - binding , EF - hand - like Eps15 homology ( EH ) domains ( designated EH1 - EH3 ) ( Figure 1A ) , where the individual tandem EH domains are about 32 % identical and 50 % similar to one another . The divergence between EH domain sequences is paralleled by differences in selectivity for endogenous tripeptide - based Asn - Pro - Phe ( NPF ) short linear motif ( SLiM ) ( Van Roey et al . , 2014 ) - containing binding partners ( Rumpf et al . , 2008 ; Paoluzi et al . , 1998 ; Confalonieri and Di Fiore , 2002 ) . Overall , EPS15 residues 1 – 314 are ~ 60 % identical and 77 % similar to resides 1 – 365 of EPS15R , a closely related paralogous protein encoded by chromosome 19 ( Wong et al . , 1995 ) ( Figure 1A ) . Comparative sequence analysis of the seven ELISA - positive V H H clones reveals three discrete families ( Figure 1B ) , albeit because of an identical hypervariable complementarity - determining region 3 ( CDR3 ) ( Figure 1C ) , family 2 and 3 might be derived from the same B cell lineage that diverge due to somatic - mutation - driven affinity maturation and / or PCR amplification errors . There are 18 amino acid differences between Nb E _ 142 and E _ 180 , but only six of the changes are within CDR1 and CDR2 . This sequence variation between family 2 and 3 is curious because the CDR3 loop is typically the longest , most divergent in amino acid composition , conformationally variable , and important for antigen recognition ( Mitchell and Colwell , 2018 ; McMahon et al . , 2018 ) .

In in vitro pull - down assays , a direct physical interaction between each of the chosen Nbs with the EPS15 N - terminal EH domain antigen is seen ( Figure 1D ) . Nb E _ 3 binds to GST - EPS15 EH1 - 3 ( resi - dues 1 – 314 ) , but poorly to GST fused in - frame to either domain EH1 alone ( residues 1 – 109 ) or EH1 + 2 ( residues 1 – 217 ) . Not unexpectedly , Nb E _ 142 and E _ 180 show similar binding selectivity , in accordance with the shared CDR3 sequences of these two Nb clones . However , Nb E _ 142 clearly shows a higher apparent affinity , and interacts with all three EH domain proteins , EH1 , EH1 + 2 and EH1 - 3 ( Figure 1D ) . One interpretation of the data is that Nb E _ 3 recognizes the EH3 domain while Nb E _ 142 ( and E _ 180 ) binds to the EH1 domain . Yet Nb E _ 3 does show appreciable binding to GST - EPS15 EH1 + 2 , and E _ 142 binds to GST - EPS15 ( 1 - 314 ) at perhaps suprastoichiometric levels , and does not require EH1 . A robust interaction of Nb E _ 142 with GST - EPS15 EH2 + 3 ( residues 121 – 314 ) occurs in addition to binding to the EH1 domain alone ( Figure 1F ) ; this interaction with a GST - fusion lacking the EH1 domain confirms specific binding of Nb E _ 142 to EH domains other than EH1 . Intriguingly , Nb E _ 3 , E _ 142 and E _ 180 , as well as the other four related Nb clones , all show the remarkable presence of an immunodominant Asn - Pro - Phe ( NPF ) tripeptide within the CDR3 region ( Figure 1C ) . A BLAST analysis of available Nb sequences using the Nb E _ 142 sequence as the search query fails to identify a single NPF sequence within the CDR3 hypervariable loop of any currently characterized V H H clone . Only a series of selected anti - Tulip virus X Nbs derived from a single alpaca contain either an NPW or NPV tripeptide sequence within the CDR3 loop ( Beekwilder et al . , 2008 ) . As the majority of EH domain partners ( the so - called EH network ) deploy some variation of the NPF SLiM ( Paoluzi et al . , 1998 ; Confalonieri and Di Fiore , 2002 ) to bind to an EH domain , this strongly suggests that the newly selected anti - EPS15 EH domain Nbs bind , in part , to the functional interac - tion surface of the EH domain ( de Beer et al . , 1998 ) . In agreement , the previously described anti - EPS15 Nb does not contain an NPF within CDR3 ( Figure 1C ) , does not bind to the native EPS15 pro - tein efficiently ( data not shown ) , and was originally selected to detect ( denatured ) EPS15 by immu - noblotting ( Regan - Klapisz et al . , 2005 ) . Direct evidence for the participation of the CDR3 NPF tripeptide in EH domain binding comes from site - directed mutagenesis . Compared with the native V H H , a Nb E _ 142 ( NPF ﬁ APA ) replace - ment eliminates completely the interaction with GST - EPS15 ( 1 - 314 ) ( Figure 2A ) . Because of the mini - mal nature of the NPF SLiM , with a single hydrophobic anchor ( Phe ) residue , individual internal NPF motifs generally bind to EH domains rather weakly , with an equilibrium dissociation constant ( K D ) of > 100 m M ( Yamabhai et al . , 1998 ; de Beer et al . , 1998 ) . Cyclized ( stapled ) NPF peptides bind with higher apparent affinity ( ~ 10 fold , de Beer et al . , 2000 ) due to stabilizing conformational rigid - ity ( Yamabhai et al . , 1998 ) , since the NPF adopts a type I b - tight turn when engaging an EH domain ( de Beer et al . , 2000 ) . It seems likely that the structural constraints of the overall Nb immunoglobu - lin ( Ig ) superfamily fold and the CDR3 loop similarly increase the apparent affinity of the Nbs for the EH domain , although contributions of CDR1 and CDR2 are also likely . The differing relative position - ing of the NPF in the CDR3 loop may be responsible for the lower apparent affinity of the Nb E _ 3 clone and / or more involvement of the CDR1 and - 2 loops in engagement of the EH3 domain .

DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 41768 5 of 42 Tools and resources Biochemistry and Chemical Biology Cell Biology Characterization of a function - blocking Nb As a protein – protein interaction module , in biochemical pull - down assays , the immobilized GST - EPS15 ( 1 - 314 ) EH1 - 3 array interacts physically with several NPF - harboring cytosolic partners from HeLa cell lysate , in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure 2B and C ) . The apparent affinity correlates roughly with the number of NPF SLiMs ( HRB : 5 ; DAB2 : 5 ; epsin 1 : 3 ; clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein ( CALM ) : 2 ) and not with the presence an extreme C - terminal NPF repeat ( HRB , DAB2 and epsin 1 ) ( Yamabhai et al . , 1998 ) , with HRB being the most avid binding partner ( Doria et al . , 1999 ; Whitehead et al . , 1999 ; Salcini et al . , 1997 ) . Both major isoforms of CALM con - tain two NPFs , one of which is near the C - terminus but not as close as occurs in either DAB2 or HRB . However , only very limited binding of cytosolic CALM to the immobilized EH domain array is evident ( Figure 2D ) . In this assay , the engagement of cytosolic NPF partners by GST - EPS15 EH1 - 3 is affected by highest apparent affinity Nb E _ 142 protein ; thus the V H H clone is function blocking . Sup - plementing HeLa cell lysate with Nb E _ 142 at an equimolar amount relative to the GST - EPS15 ( 1 - 314 ) causes a substantial loss of DAB2 and epsin 1 from the bound pellet fraction and incomplete inhibition of the HRB association . A fivefold molar excess of Nb E _ 142 produces near complete obstruction of HRB , DAB2 and epsin 1 interactions , concomitant with recovery of the bound V H H domain with the GST - EPS15 fusion in the pellet fraction ( Figure 2D ) . In addition , a W57A substitu - tion in the EPS15 EH1 domain ( Whitehead et al . , 1999 ) , which involves the absolutely phylogeneti - cally conserved Trp residue in all EH domains ( Confalonieri and Di Fiore , 2002 ; de Beer et al . , 1998 ; de Beer et al . , 2000 ) and disrupts the canonical NPF interaction surface between a - helices a C and a D ( Figure 2E ) ( Rumpf et al . , 2008 ) , abolishes the association of Nb E _ 142 with GST - EPS15 ( 1 - 109 ) ( Figure 2F ) . Yet the same W57A mutation has a comparatively modest effect on binding in the context of the larger GST - EPS15 ( 1 - 314 ) fusion protein ( Figure 2F ) . Collectively , these data clearly indicate that Nb E _ 142 engages EH domains as an NPF - mimicking pseudoligand that con - tacts a conserved interaction site upon the canonical EH domain . If the Nbs bind to EH domains primarily utilizing an NPF - motif - mediated interaction , then reactiv - ity with the related EPS15R EH domains is highly probable as the EPS15 and EPS15R EH domain regions are ~ 80 % similar . In EPS15R , both the EH1R and EH3R domains favor NPFR motifs ( Paoluzi et al . , 1998 ) and the position + 4 Arg participates directly in binding to the EPS15 EH2 domain ( de Beer et al . , 2000 ) . Strikingly , two of three of the Nb families identified display NPFR peptide sequences in CDR3 ( Figure 1C ) . In line with the biochemical differences noted for GST - EPS15 ( 1 - 314 ) engagement , both Nb E _ 3 and E _ 142 cross - react with a GST - EPS15R ( 1 - 365 ) fusion , while the Nb E _ 142 ( NPF ﬁ APA ) CDR3 mutant does not ( Figure 3A ) . Nb E _ 3 binding to EPS15R is comparatively weak , however . In sum , the biochemical data indicate that Nb E _ 142 is an orthosteric , function - blocking pseudoequivalent NPF ligand for the Eps15 / R protein EH domains . The EH domains of intersectin 1 similarly bind to NPF motifs ( Yamabhai et al . , 1998 ) , and the two N - terminal Hs intersectin 1 EH domains are about 43 % identical to one another while the EH1 - 2 array ( residues 1 – 312 ) ( Snetkov et al . , 2016 ) is roughly 39 % identical to EPS15 EH1 - 3 ( residues 1 – 314 ) and 36 % identical to EPS15R EH1R - 3R ( residues 1 – 365 ) . Yet in the same binding assay , Nb E _ 142 does not interact appreciably with GST - intersectin 1 ( 1 - 312 ) although the unmistakable Nb binding to both GST - EPS15 ( 1 – 109 / EH1 ) and GST - EPS15 ( 1 – 217 / EH1 + 2 ) is apparent ( Figure 3B ) . This indicates importantly that additional non - NPF side chains must contribute to the selective bind - ing of Nb E _ 142 to the EPS15 / R EH domains , and likely accounts for the markedly higher apparent affinity of this Nb over the native NPF ligand for EPS15 / R EH domains . Also , since none of the anti - Figure 2 continued increasing amounts of GST - EPS15 ( 1 - 314 ) EH1 - 3 domain .

DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 41768 7 of 42 Tools and resources Biochemistry and Chemical Biology Cell Biology EPS15 Nbs display acidic residues trailing the NPF in CDR3 , it makes it improbable that Nb E _ 142 binds to other proteins with C - terminal EH domains , like EHD1 ( Kieken et al . , 2010 ) . Biochemical titrations better gauge the affinity of Nb E _ 142 for EPS15 EH domains . Using 2 m M Nb E _ 142 and immobilized GST - EPS15 ( 1 – 109 / EH1 ) varied from 0 . 5 to 20 m M , saturation occurs at around 10 m M and half - maximal binding occurs at ~ 3 m M ( Figure 3C – D ) . With the larger GST - EPS15 ( 1 – 314 / EH1 - 3 ) fusion , half - maximal binding is also seen at ~ 2 m M ( Figure 3D and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . That the apparent K D for Nb E _ 142 is roughly similar for the two fusion proteins indi - cates that binding to each EH domain is independent and of similar affinity . Thus Nb E _ 142 binds to the EH domain with low micromolar affinity at physiological ionic strength ; these results demonstrate that the K D of Nb E _ 142 for an EH domain is considerably better than a single endogenous NPF peptide ( Yamabhai et al . , 1998 ; de Beer et al . , 1998 ) . Nb E _ 142 is an immunoprecipitation - grade reagent . In addition to the binary interaction with recombinant GST - EPS15 ( 1 - 314 ) antigen ( Figure 3E ) , purified His 6 - tagged Nb E _ 142 bound to Ni - NTA - agarose efficiently immunoprecipitates Eps15 from both K - 562 erythroleukemia cell ( Lozzio and Lozzio , 1975 ) lysates and rat brain cytosol ( Figure 3E ) . This Nb thus recognizes the native full - length protein . And in agreement with Nb E _ 142 also interacting with EPS15R ( Figure 3A ) , there is quantitative precipitation of EPS15R from the K - 562 lysate . Analysis of co - immunoprecipitating components shows the known EPS15 / R interaction partners FCHO1 , FCHO2 and AP - 2 ( a subunits ) ( Figure 2B ) are co - recovered with the EPS15 / R immobilized through the EH domain regions by Nb E _ 142 ( Figure 3E ) . The extent of recovery of cytosolic FCHO1 / 2 , which bind to the C - terminal DPF region of EPS15 / R with the m - homology domain ( m HD ) ( Henne et al . , 2010 ; Reider et al . , 2009 ; Umasankar et al . , 2012 ) , and AP - 2 , which binds to the DPF region of EPS15 / R utilizing the appendages of the a and b 2 subunits ( Benmerah et al . , 1996 ; Iannolo et al . , 1997 ) , mirrors the known differential affinities ( Ma et al . , 2016 ) . In the same assay , NPF - dependent EH domain binding partners ( HRB , Figure 3E ) do not co - precipitate with Eps15 / R , again in line with function - blocking Nb activity . Nb E _ 142 interacts with EPS15 intracellularly Unexpectedly , when transiently transfected into HeLa cells , the diffuse , rather featureless intracellu - lar distribution of an mNeonGreen ( mNG ) - tagged ( Shaner et al . , 2013 ) Nb E _ 142 fusion is not sub - stantially different from the control mNG protein alone , and is clearly distinct from the punctate pattern of endogenous EPS15 staining in these cells detected with an anti - peptide antibody recog - nizing the extreme C - terminus ( Hinrichsen et al . , 2003 ) ( Figure 4A – E ) . Immunoblots of whole cell extracts from transfected HeLa cells confirm synthesis and stability of the intact mNG - Nb fusion pro - teins as well as various clathrin coat components , including EPS15 ( Figure 4F ) . In fewer than half the transfected cells , small concentrations of mNG - Nb E _ 142 that overlap some EPS15 puncta are seen ( Figure 4B’ , arrowheads ) . Essentially similar results are obtained irrespective of whether Nb E _ 142 is tagged at the N or C terminus with mNG , or with enhanced green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) . In addi - tion , in repeated experiments , transfection of either GFP - tagged Nb E _ 3 or Nb E _ 180 produces an Figure 3 continued immobilized GST , GST - EPS15 ( 1 – 109 / EH1 ) or GST - EPS15 ( 1 – 217 / EH1 - 2 ) and GST - intersectin 1 l ( ITSN1l ) ( 1 – 312 / EH1 - 2 ) with periplasmic extracts containing either Nb E _ 3 , Nb E _ 142 as indicated .

While superficially these results suggest Nb E _ 142 may not function effectively as a so - called chromobody ( Rothbauer et al . , 2006 ) , in some mNG - Nb E _ 142 - expressing cells an alteration in the steady - state distribution of endogenous EPS15 is evident compared with the adjacent non - transfected cells ( Figure 4G ) . The intensity of the EPS15 surface puncta is diminished relative to adjacent non - transfected cells , indicative of less EPS15 deposition at these sites , and some limited interference with EPS15 function . Additionally , in adherent cell mem - brane cortices from inadvertently sheared - off cells ( identified by lack of DNA staining ) , a dim mNG - Nb E _ 142 signal is seen to colocalize closely with endogenous EPS15 ( Figure 4B , arrows , and Figure 4C - E ) . As Nb E _ 142 is able to robustly immunoprecipitate EPS15 ( R ) from cytosol , and because the Nbs act as pseudoligands , these transfection data suggest that in viable cells EPS15 / R deposited at clathrin coat assembly sites at the plasma membrane have EH domains locally occupied in a way that makes Nb E _ 142 binding unfavorable . The concept of avidity - dependent , regionalized NPF occupancy of the EPS15 / R EH domains gath - ered at incipient clathrin - coated structures is supported experimentally by the intracellular distribu - tion and positioning of a transiently transfected triple Nb E _ 142 array . In HeLa cells , compared with the single Nb E _ 142 fusion , a larger mNG - Nb E _ 142 (cid:2) 3 protein construct ( Figure 4—figure supple - ment 1 ) now labels punctate AP - 2 - positive structures at very low expression levels . Given that both the ectopic mNG - Nb E _ 142 and the mNG - Nb E _ 142 (cid:2) 3 proteins each contain only a single fluores - cent mNG domain , the increased efficiency of EPS15 / R labeling by the polyvalent reporter ( Fig - ure 4—figure supplement 1 ) must signify better apparent affinity for the massed EH domains at the sites of clathrin - coat assembly . This indicates that through avidity - based phenomena , artificially but flexibly grouped NPF - harboring Nbs can compete in vivo with the deployment multiple NPF - motifs by endogenous EH domain partner proteins . Markedly different results are obtained when a single Nb E _ 142 is appended in - frame to a tan - dem Fab1p , YOTB , Vac1p , and EEA1 ( FYVE 2 ) domain ( Figure 5A ) ; this leads to strong sequestration of endogenous EPS15 within cells . In HeLa SS6 cells , transient overexpression of the control GFP - FYVE 2 alone , which binds to the endosomal compartment phospholipid marker phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PtdIns3P ) ( Chen and De Camilli , 2005 ) , results in an enlarged labeled endosome com - partment ( Figure 5B ) , but the subcellular distribution of EPS15 remains undisturbed at clathrin - coated structures on the cell surface . A C - terminal Nb E _ 142 extension to the GFP - FYVE 2 chimera produces a dramatic alteration in steady - state EPS15 positioning ; the protein now colocalizes exten - sively with the clustered GFP - FYVE 2 - Nb E _ 142 fusion protein on large swollen endosomes and near completely disarranges assembly of EPS15 at typical scattered puncta on the plasma membrane ( Figure 5C ) . To explain the markedly altered subcellular distribution of EPS15 , note that a funda - mental tenet of coat - assisted vesicle formation is the cycling of coat protomers between a mem - brane - attached , assembled pool and a cytosolic , reserve pool . If EPS15 is one of the early arriving pioneers at a nascent bud , it is deposited from a supply in the dispersed soluble pool . The popula - tion of EPS15 in the cytosolic fraction ( Figure 3 ) ( van Delft et al . , 1997a ) confirms that this coat pro - tein too cycles between a membrane - assembled and a cytosolic pool . Additionally , like the tandem mNG - Nb E _ 142 (cid:2) 3 fusion , a concentrating / multivalency effect of densely tethered Nb E _ 142 upon a two - dimensional membrane surface markedly increases the capacity of the Nb to capture endoge - nous EPS15 at that site . The endosome - bound Nb E _ 142 can thus lure EPS15 from the latter soluble Figure 4 continued shown with nuclei ( asterisks ) in intact cells identified . The presence of mNG - Nb E _ 142 within EPS15 - positive , morphologically aberrant clathrin - coated structures is evident on the adherent membrane fragments from sheared - off non - viable cells ( Heuser , 1989 ) .

Thus organelle - attached Nb E _ 142 disturbs the steady - state balance of endogenous EPS15 ( R ) positioning within the cell , and therefore does function as an intrabody . Compared with the GFP - FYVE 2 - Nb E _ 142 chimera , a destabilized mutant ( designated 3maj ; Tang et al . , 2016 ) with three framework side chain substitutions ( S73R , C98Y and S117F ; GFP - FYVE 2 - desNb E _ 142 ; see Figure 1C ) also relocalizes endogenous EPS15 to an expanded , PtdIns3P - positive endosomal compartment in HeLa SS6 cells ( Figure 5D ) . The rationale for the conditionally - destabilized mutant is that in the absence of antigen binding , the structurally perturbed Nb V H H is labile and subject to protein quality control and accelerated proteasomal degradation ( Tang et al . , 2016 ) . However , the effect of the conditionally destabilized Nb on EPS15 redistribution is not as penetrant as the native Nb . Assembly of endogenous EPS15 at plasma membrane clathrin - coated structures is still evident . Despite the dramatic change in intracellular localization of EPS15 , immuno - blots show that ectopic expression of neither Nb E _ 142 nor desNb E _ 142 alters the overall abun - dance of EPS15 , EPS15R or other core clathrin coat components ( Figure 5E ) . Further , at low - to - moderate relative expression levels , AP - 2 remains at dispersed puncta at the plasma membrane despite the massive relocation of EPS15 ( R ) to GFP - FYVE 2 - Nb E _ 142 - positive intracellular endosomal structures ( Figure 5F , arrows ) . In cells expressing high levels of GFP - FYVE 2 - Nb E _ 142 with promi - nent enlarged PtdIns ( 3 ) P - positive endosomes , AP - 2 becomes mislocalized with the EPS15 on these internal organelles and AP - 2 puncta at the cell surface become less abundant ( Figure 5F , arrow - heads ) but not in the GFP - FYVE 2 - desNb E _ 142 producing HeLa cells ( Figure 5G ) . Yet , in 5 min uptake assays of fluorescently - tagged transferrin , GFP - FYVE 2 - Nb E _ 142 - producing cells traffic the endocytic tracer into the lumen of swollen endosomes in cells irrespective of whether there is strong AP - 2 clustering with the Nb bound EPS15 or not ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 , arrowheads ) . Because of the dilated lumen of expanded endosomes in the presence of the overexpressed FYVE 2 module , the internalized transferrin signal is generally neither as compact nor intense as in the adja - cent untransfected cells ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1G – J ) ; thus the results are confounded by overexpression - induced endosome morphology alterations . Nevertheless , despite the FYVE 2 - pro - voked variable endosomal dimensions ( a right - shifted volume distribution of tracer - labeled endo - somes ) , quantifying integrated fluorescence intensity of the internalized transferrin tracer shows that prominent sequestration of EPS15 ( R ) on endosomes by ectopic Nb E _ 142 clearly does not terminate clathrin - mediated endocytosis of transferrin in HeLa SS6 cells ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1J ) . Mitochondria - directed Nb E _ 142 effects on CCS structure and function Because transient overexpression of the PtdIns3P - binding tandem FYVE domain alters endosome morphology considerably and may perturb endosomal structure and dynamics in functional studies ( Gucwa and Brown , 2014 ; Hu et al . , 2002 ) , a mitochondria - tethered alternative Nb E _ 142 fusion was evaluated . The tailored chimera is composed of a 31 - amino acid N - terminal mitochondrial outer membrane targeting element from M . musculus Akap1 ( Ma and Taylor , 2008 ) fused in - frame to Nb E _ 142 and then followed by infra - red fluorescent protein ( iRFP ; Filonov et al . , 2011 ) . Very similar near - quantitative intracellular redistribution of endogenous EPS15 in HeLa SS6 cells expressing this fusion protein , but not a control ( with central FKBP12 - rapamycin binding ( FRB ) domain instead of the Nb E _ 142 module ) , is evident ( Figure 6A and B ) . EPS15 puncta disappear from the basal sur - face , and in medial confocal optical sections , cells expressing the Akap1 - Nb E _ 142 - iRFP do not dis - play assembled EPS15 puncta at the cell margins , as seen in the adjacent untransfected or Akap1 - FRB - iRFP transfected cells ( Figure 6B’ , arrows ) .

Functional studies show that both Akap1 - FRB - iRFP and Akap1 - Nb E _ 142 - iRFP - producing HeLa cells internalize transferrin despite the conspicuous difference in EPS15 positioning within the Nb E _ 142 - expressing cells ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A – B’ ) , as is seen with the GFP - FYVE 2 - Nb E _ 142 - producing cells ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . A small subpopulation of Akap1 - Nb E _ 142 - iRFP - expressing cells display strongly suppressed , but not halted , transferrin internalization . Since a similar fraction ( ~ 15 % ) of the Akap1 - FRB - iRFP fusion produces a similar phenotype , the diminished transferrin uptake is not likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and ATP restriction but more proba - bly due to the known cell - cycle dependence of transferrin endocytosis ( Sager et al . , 1984 ) and / or heterogeneity in relative internalization dependent upon local context and positioning of the cul - tured cells within the adherent population ( Snijder et al . , 2009 ) . Overall , in the presence of a normal complement of endocytic clathrin coat components , artificial spatial displacement of EPS15 / R onto mitochondria does not severely disrupt short - term clathrin - mediated endocytosis in parental HeLa SS6 cells . Mitochondria sequestration of EPS15 in gene - edited HeLa cells As Eps15 / R and Fcho1 / 2 function along the same pathway in a redundant manner ( Ma et al . , 2016 ; Wang et al . , 2016b ) , the effect of forced expression of the mitochondria - targeted Nb E _ 142 was explored in novel HeLa cells rendered FCHO1 / 2 - and EPS15R - null by successive TALEN - mediated gene editing ( Figure 7A ) . Of the three new triple - null lines obtained that exhibit indels within the targeted exon 5 region of the EPS15R - encoding EPS15L1 gene on chromosome 19 ( Figure 7B ) , and have no detectable EPS15R protein on immunoblots ( Figure 7C ) , one , clone # 40 , was selected for further analysis . The relative cellular abundance of EPS15 , AP - 2 and several other clathrin - mediated endocytosis components is not changed in the HeLa clone # 40 cells ( Figure 7C ) . Like the HeLa clone # 64 / 1 . E cells from which they are derived , clone # 40 cells display morphologically abnormal clathrin - coated structures at steady state ( Figure 7D – F ) ; compared with the parental HeLa SS6 cells , fewer , larger and more clustered AP - 2 - and EPS15 - positive clathrin assemblies are present on the ventral membrane in clone # 40 cells . This abnormal distribution and morphology of clathrin - coated struc - tures in the genome - edited cells implies FCHO1 / 2 and EPS15R play some significant role in bud site selection and maintenance . Side - by - side comparison of transferrin uptake and the steady - state abundance of transferrin receptors at the cell surface reveals that both the HeLa # 64 / 1 . E ( Umasankar et al . , 2014 ) and the clone # 40 cells display defective clathrin - mediated endocytosis compared with parental HeLa SS6 cells ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ) . Although fluorescent transferrin is internalized into periph - eral early endosomes ( lysosome - associated membrane glycoprotein 1 ( LAMP1 ) - negative ) in a 5 min pulse of the genome - edited cells at 37˚C ( accounting for their long - term viability ) , the extent is less than in the HeLa SS6 cells . Instead , the majority of the transferrin is bound to transferrin receptors diffusely situated over the plasma membrane ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1B’ and C’ ) . This pool of surface transferrin receptors is not similarly evident in the parental cells . Comparative accumula - tion of surface transferrin receptors in the genome - edited lines is confirmed by fluorescent Figure 6 continued views , EPS15 assembled in clathrin - coated structures at the plasma membrane is indicated ( arrows ) .

DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 41768 15 of 42 Tools and resources Biochemistry and Chemical Biology Cell Biology transferrin labeling experiments conducted on ice for 60 min ( unpublished ) ; the data thus indicate slowed egress of the transferrin receptor from the surface of the genome - edited cells for reentry into the endosomal compartment , leading to stalling and accumulation of this ( and other ) endocytic cargo at the plasma membrane . Transient expression of negative control Akap1 - FRB - iRFP in the HeLa clone # 40 cells has no obvi - ous effect on the subcellular patterning of EPS15 ( Figure 8A ) , as in parental the HeLa SS6 cells . The high degree of colocalization of EPS15 with AP - 2 at surface puncta is not different from adjacent untransfected cells . By contrast , in Akap1 - Nb E _ 142 - iRFP producing clone # 40 cells , ectopic trap - ping of EPS15 on the mitochondria - massed Nb E _ 142 is clear , with a concomitant loss of EPS15 from the plasma membrane . In these transfected clone # 40 cells , AP - 2 clusters at the surface are diminished in size and number in a manner that correlates with the efficiency of EPS15 segregation at mitochondria ( Figure 8B - F ) . The majority of AP - 2 - positive puncta that do remain are populated with detectable endogenous EPS15 protein ( Figure 8C – F ) . Thus , in this genetic background stable membrane - associated AP - 2 assemblies depend heavily on EPS15 for their generation . Based on the apparent affinity and computed cellular abundance in HeLa cells ( Hein et al . , 2015 ; Itzhak et al . , 2016 ) , HRB , HRB - like protein ( HRBL ) and DAB2 are most likely the predominant inter - action partners for the EH domains at assembling clathrin - coated structures ( Figure 2 ) . Comparison of the steady - state distribution of EPS15 and HRB in clone # 40 cells shows that whereas both pro - teins overlap at the aberrant enlarged clathrin - coated structures that are a distinctive feature of untransfected cells , in Akap1 - Nb E _ 142 - iRFP - expressing cells , neither protein is efficiently deposited on the plasma membrane ( Figure 8G – L ) . In these cells , EPS15 is lured onto the cytosolic face of mitochondria but HRB is not , and EPS15 is associated with the few HRB puncta that are evident at the plasma membrane ( Figure 8I – L ) . Thus , in the presence of Akap1 - Nb E _ 142 - iRFP , HRB is essen - tially displaced into the soluble cytosolic compartment . Overall , these findings recapitulate the effect of combined EPS15 and EPS15R RNAi in the parental HeLa clone # 64 / 1 . E cells , where there is a shift from large irregular clathrin - coated assemblies to small , abortive diffraction - limited structures ( Ma et al . , 2016 ) . The defects in AP - 2 - containing clathrin - coated structures in Akap1 - Nb E _ 142 - iRFP - transfected clone # 40 cells translate into clathrin - mediated endocytosis dysfunction . A modified uptake assay format ( Reis et al . , 2015 ) , with a 2 min pulse of transferrin at 37˚C followed by surface stripping on ice and rewarming to 37˚C for a further 2 min ( Figure 9A ) , was used since the clone # 40 cells display faulty clathrin - mediated internalization ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ) . As this procedure removes the surface bound transferrin pool , alterations in rapid internalization are easier to discern . Loss of EPS15 from surface puncta in clone # 40 cells by massing upon mitochondria with Akap1 - Nb E _ 142 - iRFP has a strong inhibitory effect on transferrin uptake ( Figure 9 ) . In both basal and medial confocal optical sections and maximal intensity projections , the presence of small intracellular endosomes positive for the fluorescent endocytic tracer is strongly decreased compared with the neighboring untransfected cells , and also with control Akap1 - FRB - iRFP producing clone # 40 HeLa cells ( Figure 9 ) . In these experiments , quantitation shows that the number of > 0 . 2 m m 2 transferrin - positive intracellu - lar structures within the three - dimensional volume of untransfected cells surrounding the Akap1 - Nb E _ 142 - iRFP - expressing cells is roughly double that of the EPS15 - sequested cell population ( Fig - ure 9—figure supplement 1 ) . Since the larger transferrin - containing vesicular structures represent progressive concentrating endosomal fusion reactions ( Rink et al . , 2005 ) , and because the Akap1 - Nb E _ 142 - iRFP - transfected HeLa clone # 40 cells display substantially elevated levels of transferrin Figure 7 continued resistant indels in the three TALEN clones is indicated .

Rescue of AP - 2 puncta in clone # 40 cells with grossly misplaced EPS15 by the FCHO1 unstructured interdomain linker Ectopic expression of Akap1 - Nb E _ 142 - iRFP is unlikely to grossly perturb PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels on the basis of the proper plasma membrane deposition of endogenous AP - 2 in transfected HeLa SS6 cells ( Figure 6 ) . Indeed , the failure of AP - 2 to assemble into normally dispersed puncta at the surface of clone # 40 cells is not due to bulk effects on phosphoinositide metabolism in Akap1 - Nb E _ 142 - iRFP - transfected cells . Using the phospholipase C d 1 pleckstrin - homology ( PH ) domain as an intracellular biosensor for PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , both co - transfected Akap1 - FRB - iRFP or Akap1 - Nb E _ 142 - iRFP - express - ing cells show an abundance of this plasma membrane localized lipid even with the marked differ - ence in EPS15 localization ( Figure 10A and B ) . These results reveal that despite a plasma membrane supply of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , elevated levels of the transferrin receptor at the cell surface ( Figure 7—fig - ure supplement 1 ) , and a normal cellular concentration of AP - 2 ( Figure 7C ) , the absence of utiliz - able FCHO1 / 2 and EPS15 / R pioneers in HeLa clone # 40 cells is not compatible with widespread and stable deposition of AP - 2 at the cell surface and assembly of clathrin - coated structures . In addition , the noted parallel decrease in AP - 2 and HRB puncta in the presence of the Akap1 - Nb E _ 142 - iRFP trap again supports the notion that the EH domains of EPS15 / R play a key role in docking HRB at nascent coated buds . Fully concordant with the widely dispersed PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 within the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane in both Akap1 - FRB - iRFP - and Akap1 - Nb E _ 142 - iRFP - transfected HeLa clone # 40 cells is the restoration of extensive and apparently random deposition of AP - 2 on co - transfection with GFP - tagged FCHO1 ( 1 – 609 ) ( Figure 11 ) . This truncated FCHO1 protein contains the membrane - binding N - terminal EFC / F - BAR domain ( Umasankar et al . , 2012 ; Henne et al . , 2007 ) and the adjoining intrinsically disordered linker that appears to operate as an allosteric activator ( Umasankar et al . , 2014 ; Hollopeter et al . , 2014 ) , driving a reconfiguration of AP - 2 from the closed to the membrane - bound open state ( Jackson et al . , 2010 ) . Ectopic GFP - FCHO1 ( 1 – 609 ) can reconstitute the regularly dispersed HeLa clathrin - coated structure pattern at very low levels of expression of the linker ( Figure 11A ) . Measurement of AP - 2 - positive puncta in FCHO1 linker - expressing cells , compared with adjacent non - transfected HeLa clone # 40 cells , documents the overall shift to smaller , more numerous 0 . 2 – 0 . 6 m m 2 structures ( Figure 11—figure supplement 1 ) . In parallel technical replicates , as expected EPS15 is sequestered prominently by the overexpressed Nb decoy on mitochondria , and little endogenous EPS15 is deposited along with the corrected AP - 2 in the compact , scattered surface puncta ( Figure 11B ) . Thus the normalizing effect of the FCHO1 ( EFC domain and ) linker is manifest largely in the absence of co - assembled EPS15 . Also in the same experiment , by itself the expressed GFP - FCHO1 ( 1 – 609 ) produces a profusion of small clathrin - coated structures spread over the basal plasma membrane that contain both AP - 2 and EPS15 , while the transfected Akap1 - Nb E _ 142 - iRFP alone repeatedly diminishes the intensity and abundance of AP - 2 structures at the ven - tral surface of clone # 40 cells ( Figure 11C – D ) . The FCHO1 - corrected phenotype is starkly different from the untransfected clone # 40 cells , and closely mirrors the results seen in clone # 64 / 1 . E cells ( Umasankar et al . , 2014 ; Sager et al . , 1984 ) , where we have shown this is not due to the phospho - lipid - binding N - terminal EFC domain ( Umasankar et al . , 2014 ) . These striking results again verify that FCHO1 / 2 act epistatically to EPS15 / R and demonstrate clearly that a major role of EPS15 / R is normally to cooperate with full - length FCHO1 / 2 to bind to and activate AP - 2 proteins at incipient clathrin - coated structures , as we previously suggested ( Ma et al . , 2016 ) .

The GFE3 plasmid , which contains a GFP reporter and an anti - body - like gephyrin recognizing FingR module for ubiquitin conjugation and targeted proteasomal degradation of gephyrin mediated by an in - frame fusion of the Rattus norvegicus X - linked inhibitor of apoptosis ( XIAP ) E3 ligase RING domain ( residues 440 – 496 ) ( Gross et al . , 2016 ) , was repurposed by substitution of Nb E _ 142 for the fibronectin - derived FingR section . The negative control , parental GFE3 transfection into HeLa SS6 cells , has negligible impact on the steady - state distribution of EPS15 at clathrin - coated puncta on the ventral cell surface ( Figure 12A ) . By contrast , the G - Nb E _ 142 - E3 plasmid is highly effective in promoting the degradation of EPS15 in transiently trans - fected cells positive for GFP ( Figure 12B ) . The effectiveness of the XIAP E3 is superior to similar con - structs containing the C - terminus of Hsc70 - interacting protein ( CHIP ) or von Hippel - Lindau tumor suppressor E3 ligase domain ( data not shown ) . Variability of different synthetic E3 ligase chimeras to promote degradation of selected target proteins has been seen by others ( Shin et al . , 2015 ) . As with Akap1 - Nb E _ 142 - iRFP , effective elimination of EPS15 / R by the tailored G - Nb E _ 142 - E3 fusion protein still leaves AP - 2 assembled at clathrin - coated sites on the plasma membrane of the HeLa SS6 cells ( Figure 12C – D ) .

The molecular mode of action of function - blocking intrabodies varies . Some can disrupt a critical protein – protein , protein – nucleic acid or protein – lipid interaction , thereby pre - venting the normal biological activity of the target , or stabilize a specific , functionally significant con - formational state ( Staus et al . , 2016 ; Zimmermann et al . , 2018 ) . Alternatively , and especially for proteins that operate as interaction hubs like Eps15 / R ( Figure 2B ) , where a single Nb cannot possi - bly incapacitate all of the interaction information encoded within the target protein , imposed regional compartmental sequestration is a companion strategy . Here , using new NPF motif - harbor - ing llama Nbs , it is demonstrated that during assembly the collective EH domains of EPS15 and EPS15R deposited at clathrin - coated structures appear poorly accessible ; this provides an important clue to the occupancy of EH domains during lattice assembly and sorting in light of the known mod - est K D for a single NPF . EH domain interaction ( Yamabhai et al . , 1998 ; de Beer et al . , 1998 ) . These results confirm and extend previous data showing that ectopic expression of the tandem EH domain module can inhibit clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Carbone et al . , 1997 ) , and that removal of EH2 + EH3 from EPS15 prevents proper targeting to and stationing at clathrin - coated structures ( Benmerah et al . , 1999 ) . Inactivating point mutations to each of the three EH domains of the full - length Drosophila Eps15 orthologue abolish proper positioning at the synapse , while a C - terminally truncated D DPF mutant still localizes properly and is able to effectively rescue the defective synaptic vesicle endocytosis at eps15 - null nerve terminals ( Koh et al . , 2007 ) . And in the squid giant axon , microinjection of an NPF peptide interferes with clathrin - mediated endocytosis at an early stage , roughly halving the occurrence of clathrin - coated structures at the synapse ( Morgan et al . , 2003 ) . Eps15b , an alternatively - spliced isoform of Eps15 in vertebrates , lacks the N - terminal EH1 - 3 tandem array entirely and does not localize to the plasma membrane but rather to endosomes ( Roxrud et al . , 2008 ) . Yet the EH domain module , alone , is not able to concentrate at clathrin - coated structures ( Benmerah et al . , 2000 ) . In the budding yeast S . cerevisiae , where Hs EPS15 can substitute for the orthologous Ede1p , the minimal region of Ede1p necessary for proper targeting to clathrin - coated buds is EH3 , a flanking proline - rich region and the coiled - coil domain ( Lu and Drubin , 2017 ) . This argues that EH domains play a critical role in placing Eps15 at the membrane bud site but highlights the cooperativity of the binding information hardwired into Eps15 / R ( Figure 2B ) and their early - arriv - ing binding partners . In metazoa , these include AP - 2 , Fcho1 / 2 , Hrb , Dab2 , epsin , and CALM ( Manna et al . , 2015 ) . These endocytic proteins display a densely wired interactome , and it seems likely they are responsible for high frequency occupancy of the EH domains at clathrin assembly sites . Like EPS15 / R , HRB / L ( also designated AGFG1 / 2 ) and DAB2 are both detected in proximity labeling mass spectrometry experiments as early , and thus edge positioned , components ( Paek et al . , 2017 ) . Because Nb E _ 142 can bind efficiently to EPS15 / R in the soluble state , the poor labeling at clathrin - coated structures with mNG - Nb E _ 142 and other tagged versions indicates not only that the EH domain module is locally occupied at these assembly zones , but that any mono - meric Nb E _ 142 bound to incoming EPS15 / R is promptly displaced by the forming EH network that Figure 11 continued outlined ) , while the iRFP is pseudocolored ( blue ) .

Somewhat contradictory , Nb E _ 142 can compete with dilute binding partners in vitro ( Figure 2 ) ; Nb E _ 142 therefore varies in the ability to bind stably to EH domains dependent on the surrounding microenvironment . A plausible explanation for this apparent discrep - ancy is an increase in effective membrane concentration of the endogenous EH binding partners at nascent clathrin bud sites by two - dimensional partitioning and avidity effects slowing unbinding and diffusion away ( Yogurtcu and Johnson , 2018 ) . The results from the new triple - null clone # 40 HeLa cells expressing a mitochondria - bound Nb E _ 142 illustrate that without FCHO1 / 2 and EPS15 / R , coated assemblies do not form stably and cla - thrin - mediated endocytosis falters . Thus the steady - state perdurance of clathrin - coated structures depends on presence of the pioneer EPS15 in clone # 40 cells , albeit with abnormal morphology . However , in parental HeLa cells , loss of either set alone does not similarly abolish uptake ( Ma et al . , 2016 ; Umasankar et al . , 2012 ; Teckchandani et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 , Fig - ure 6—figure supplement 1 ) . To explain this compensation , there must be a shared partner protein ( s ) that is bound to both these pioneers , and can still operate in the absence of one . Again , this is emblematic of the extensive redundancy in the pioneer interaction web ( Figure 2B ) . Potential candi - dates for a critical common partner are once more AP - 2 and / or its direct binding partners DAB2 , CALM , HRB or epsin . Both CALM and HRB operate as vital SNARE retrieving sorting adaptors ( Miller et al . , 2011 ; Pryor et al . , 2008 ) . That the Nb - directed mislocalization of EPS15 in the HeLa clone # 40 cells leads to bulk loss of clathrin - coated structures and diminished clathrin - based uptake indicates that the EH domain proteins intersectin 1 and intersectin 2 , which are both expressed in HeLa cells ( Figure 4 ) ( Itzhak et al . , 2016 ) , cannot sustain the process without FCHO1 / 2 and EPS15 / R . These findings differ from siRNA - based experiments ( Teckchandani et al . , 2012 ) unless Nb E _ 142 also quantitatively depletes intersectins . Nb E _ 142 does not bind physically to the intersectin 1 EH domains , and although hierarchical clustering , based on ultrastructural localization within clathrin - coated structures , places EPS15 / R and intersectin in distinct branches ( Sochacki et al . , 2017 ) , and the BioPlex 2 . 0 database ( with HEK 293 cells ) ( Schweppe et al . , 2018 ) does not score EPS15 / R as intersectin 1 or - 2 binding partners , the noted discrepancy could be due to intersectins binding physically to EPS15 / R ( Sengar et al . , 1999 ) and so being concomitantly unavailable when massed at an inappropriate intracellular organelle , or due to lower cellular abundance . Quantitative proteomics reveals that in HeLa cells intersectin 1 and - 2 are present at ~ 20 – 30 % the level of EPS15 / R ( Hein et al . , 2015 ; Itzhak et al . , 2016 ) . The experiments presented here reveal that the pioneers localized to the perimeter of clathrin - coated structures at steady state ( Sochacki et al . , 2017 ; Ma et al . , 2016 ; Tebar et al . , 1996 ; Henne et al . , 2010 ; Edeling et al . , 2006 ) are generally necessary for the inception of new clathrin - coated buds . Because HeLa clone # 40 cells clearly have PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane when Akap1 - Nb E _ 142 - iRFP is expressed , the diminished number and / or inten - sity of AP - 2 puncta in these cells highlights the supportive role the FCHO1 / 2 - EPS15 / R partnership plays in stabilizing active , conformationally - rearranged AP - 2 at the cell surface . The still normal abun - dance of cytosolic AP - 2 and clathrin in these multiply genome - edited cells tends to argue strongly against AP - 2 pairs simply engaging the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich plasma membrane and simultaneously interacting with a clathrin triskelion to initiate stable , productive clathrin coat assembly ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ) . Indeed , super - resolution microscopy of the AP - 2 and clathrin distribution at the ventral surface in single HeLa cells reveals substantial amounts of membrane - deposited AP - 2 without a coincident clathrin signal ( Leyton - Puig et al . , 2017 ) . While it is possible that a priming FCHO1 / 2 . EPS15 / R nanocluster ( Ma et al . , 2016 ) operates downstream or alongside AP - 2 colliding with the plasma membrane in a suitable orientation to engage PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 through the binding sites on the large a - and b 2 - subunit trunks ( Jackson et al . , 2010 ; Gaidarov et al . , 1996 ) , the fact that the intrinsically disordered linker in Fcho1 / 2 appears to act as a regulator of AP - 2 switching from the closed to the open state ( Umasankar et al . , 2014 ; Hollopeter et al . , 2014 ) suggests that Figure 12 continued HeLa SS6 cells , transiently XIAP E3 ligase transfected as in A and B above , were stained with antibodies against EPS15 ( red ) and the AP - 2 a subunit ( blue ) as indicated . Color - separated enlargements ( C’ – D’’ ) of the regions boxed in C and D are shown below . Scale bar ; 10 m m .

DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 41768 24 of 42 Tools and resources Biochemistry and Chemical Biology Cell Biology these pioneers promote the stable association of AP - 2 with the membrane . The strongest evidence for this model is the unmistakable reconstitution of apparently normal AP - 2 puncta in the presence of a membrane - tethered FCHO1 linker domain in clone # 40 cells ( Figure 11 ) . Under normal circum - stances at the edge of a de novo forming coat , membrane - attached FCHO1 / 2 interacts with incom - ing EPS15 / R through the m HD ( Ma et al . , 2016 ; Shimada et al . , 2016 ) , steering the AP - 2 - bound EPS15 to relay the heterotetramer to FCHO1 / 2 for local access to the activating linker . This concept is in line with EPS15 / R being the highest affinity binding partner of the FCHO1 / 2 m HD ( Umasankar et al . , 2012 ; Shimada et al . , 2016 ) and being the only proteins in the genome with the tandem DPFX 2 - 3 DPFX 2 - 3 DPF SLiMs necessary for optimal m HD engagement , both FCHO1 / 2 ( Umasankar et al . , 2012 ; Henne et al . , 2007 ) and EPS15 ( Wang et al . , 2016b ) binding to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and the interdomain linker of FCHO1 / 2 regulating AP - 2 ( Umasankar et al . , 2014 ; Hollopeter et al . , 2014 ) to rearrange the m 2 subunit to co - align PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , YXXØ and [ DE ] XXXL [ LI ] cargo binding interaction surfaces at the planar plasma membrane ( Jackson et al . , 2010 ) . The data are also consistent with these rim - localized pioneers being able to drive deposition of new , open AP - 2 into the interior of the incipient lattice . It has recently been demonstrated that large , long - lived clathrin assemblies in human embryonic stem cell - derived fibroblasts correlate with elevated expression levels of AP - 2 ( Dambournet et al . , 2018 ) . Strikingly , while this may be mechanistically related to the abnormal clathrin - coated struc - tures in the genome - edited HeLa clone # 64 / 1 . E and clone # 40 cells , due to an increase in the cyto - solic AP - 2 pool , the effect of EPS15 impoundment in clone # 40 cells shown here indicates that even with high soluble levels of AP - 2 and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , normally sized and distributed clathrin - coated structures on the plasma membrane require the activity of EPS15 / R and FCHO1 / 2 . It has also just been reported that conditionally hematopoietic compartment compound - null Eps15 - / - / Eps15L1 - / - mice are anemic due to dysfunctional erythrocyte differentiation and maturation ( Milesi et al . , 2019 ) . Remarkably , although the transferrin receptor is the prototypical AP - 2 - dependent YXXØ - sig - nal - harboring transmembrane receptor ( Traub and Bonifacino , 2013 ; Collawn et al . , 1990 ) , the Eps15 - / - / Eps15L1 - / - double knock - out mice display strikingly abnormal accumulation of the transferrin receptor on the surface of the defective circulating red blood cell population ( Milesi et al . , 2019 ) . This dysregulation of the efficient internalization of the transferrin receptor in the erythrocyte precur - sor cells ( reticulocytes ) expressing normal AP - 2 is obviously reminiscent of the phenotype of HeLa clone # 40 cells with Nb E _ 142 - mediated sequestration of EPS15 shown here , and independently reit - erates the upstream role of Eps15 / R ( and Fcho1 / 2 ) in the proper functioning of the AP - 2 adaptor complex under normal conditions . The utility of Nb - based tools for endocytosis research The rationale behind generating Nbs against clathrin coat components is that , because clathrin - mediated endocytosis is an essential process , there is likely a limit to the number of component genes that can be systematically disrupted before overall cell viability becomes compromised . As shown here , tailored Nb - based intrabodies with in - frame subcellular compartment targeting informa - tion can impose relocation / mislocalization of Nb antigens , and change the dynamics , spread and accessibility of the soluble pool of the target antigen ( Beghein et al . , 2016 ) . Repurposed E3 ligases can impose non - physiological turnover of Nb target proteins as an alternative to RNAi and genome - editing techniques ( Moutel et al . , 2016 ) . These engineered biological tools do not require normal catabolic turnover of the target protein , as in si / shRNA - mediated gene silencing . Instead , as soon as the Nb - based chimera titrates out the target , either by compartmental sequestration or ectopic E3 - mediated proteasomal degradation , any morphological or functional effect can be examined . Although not explored here , two other potential methods to promote rapid proteasomal degrada - tion of EPS15 / R with the Nb E _ 142 intrabody are by appending a degron sequence directly to the Nb ( Zhao et al . , 2018 ) or through TRIM21 - mediated ubiquitination by making a combinatorial anti - body fusing an Fc domain to the V H H domain and using the ‘Trim - Away’ approach ( Clift et al . , 2017 ) . There are some constraints to the approaches reported here . For one thing , because they depend on transient transfection , the absolute expression level within the transfected cell population varies widely . While this can reveal dose - dependent effects , it hampers bulk population - based stud - ies , as does the overall transfection efficiency . It might also be useful to modify the subcellular sequestration approach to make it inducible , either with chemical ( Stanton et al . , 2018 ) or Traub . eLife 2019 ; 8 : e41768 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 41768 25 of 42 Tools and resources Biochemistry and Chemical Biology Cell Biology optogenetic ( Benedetti et al . , 2018 ) dimerizers . Future investigations can explore whether a strat - egy of electroporation of purified recombinant Nb E - 142 protein chimeras ( Clift et al . , 2017 ) or appending a cell - penetrating adduct to the Nb ( Herce et al . , 2017 ) can alter the kinetics of the phe - notypic response . An important practical feature of the assortment of tools described here is that , because of the highly conserved nature of the Nb framework sequence and fold , other , different antigen selective Nbs can be quickly and simply substituted for Nb E _ 142 by standard cloning techniques . Finally , it is atypical that the NPF - harboring Nbs , especially Nb E _ 142 , do not map to a single epi - tope upon the EH domain but rather present an orthosteric pseudoligand . This is a manifestation of the important structural differences between single - domain ( V H H ) and classical dimeric heavy - light chain antibodies ( Dmitriev et al . , 2016 ; Zimmermann et al . , 2018 ) . Protruding CDR loops project off one edge of V H H Ig b - sandwich domain ( Figure 1E ) , making them conformationally biased and poorly anti - peptide selective , quite unlike traditional heavy + light chain antibodies ( De Genst et al . , 2006 ; Muyldermans et al . , 2009 ) . This is the underlying reason for Nbs being able to recognize and stabilize different conformations of GPCRs and attendant signaling components ( Manglik et al . , 2017 ) .

Recombinant DNA A plasmid encoding full - length ( amino acids 1 – 896 ) Hs EPS15 in pGEX - 5X - 1 was kindly provided by Tomas Kirchhausen . The EH domain module ( 1 - 314 ) fused to the C - terminus of GST was generated from this parental plasmid using QuikChange site - directed mutagenesis ( Agilent ) to introduce a stop codon at position 315 ( S315 * ) using the primers listed in Table 1 . This plasmid was then used to make GST - EPS15 ( 1 - 109 ) and ( 1 - 217 ) by similar introduction of L110 * and W218 * stop codons ( Table 1 ) using QuikChange . The GST - EPS15 ( 121 - 314 ) construct was prepared using Phusion muta - genesis and the phosphorylated primer set listed in Table 1 . GST - EPS15R ( 1 - 365 ) was generated by PCR using primers ( Table 1 ) and an EPS15L1 cDNA ( BC142716 , Transomic Technologies ) and cloned into pGEX - 5X - 1 between BamHI and XhoI sites . The pMW172 vector containing GST fused to Hs intersectin 1 l ( 1 - 312 ) , inserted between Not I and EcoRI restriction sites ( Snetkov et al . , 2016 ) , was generously provided by Michael Way . The cDNAs encoding Nb E _ 3 , E _ 142 and E _ 180 were amplified by PCR from preparations in pMECS using the primers A6E and PMCF ( Table 1 ) and cloned into pHEN6c between PstI and BstEII sites . This encodes a Nb with an N - terminal 22 - residue PelB sequence for periplasmic expression and a His 6 tag at the C terminus . QuikChange mutagenesis was used to introduce the NPF ﬁ APA substitution in the Nb E _ 142 pHEN6c plasmid using an appropriate primer set ( Table 1 ) . Nb E _ 3 / 142 / 180 were amplified by PCR for cloning into pEGFP - N1 vector using universal primers ( Table 1 ) . For insertion of these Nbs into a mNG - encoding plasmid , first mNG was amplified from a commercially - synthesized mNG clone ( Genscript ) using a primer pair ( Table 1 ) and then substituted for eGFP in the pEGFP - C1 vector using the AgeI and XhoI restriction sites . Nb E _ 3 and E _ 142 were then subcloned into this vector utilizing PCR with primers ( Table 1 ) allowing in - frame insertion with the BglII and HindIII sites and adding four glycine residues between the mNG and the Nb . For con - struction of the in - frame tandem mNG - Nb E _ 142 (cid:2) 3 vector , the cloning involved sequential addi - tion of the PCR - amplified ( primer pairs reported in Table 1 ) Nb E - 142 cDNA between HindIII and SalI sites with a ( Ser - Gly - Gly ) 3 spacer between Nb repeat 1 and 2 , insertion of a third Nb E _ 142 cDNA between SalI and BamHI sites with a Val - Asp - Gly - Gly - Ser - Gly - Gly - Ser - Gly - Gly spacer between Nb 2 and 3 and a 3’ TAA stop codon and , finally , directional cloning replacement of the first Nb E _ 142 repeat between BglII and HindIII sites to remove the original in - frame stop codon . GFP - FYVE 2 - Hs FCHO1 m HD plasmid , modified from the GFP - FYVE 2 - Ub D GG plasmid from Pietro de Camilli ( Chen and De Camilli , 2005 ) , has been described previously ( Ma et al . , 2016 ) .

Nb E _ 3 , E _ 142 and E _ 180 were amplified by PCR with primers ( Table 1 ) and substituted for the FCHO1 m HD between EcoRI and ApaI sites , adding four glycine residues following the second tandem FYVE domain . The conditionally stable version of Nb E _ 142 , with the 3maj substitutions ( S73R , C98Y and S117F ; Tang et al . , 2016 ) was synthesized commercially ( IDT ) and subcloned into the GFP - FYVE 2 - plasmid similarly using a primer pair ( Table 1 ) and the same restriction sites . The Akap1 - FRB - iRFP - encoding plasmid ( piRFP - N1 - Akap1 - FRB ) was provided by Gerry Hammond . Using primers ( Table 1 ) Nb E _ 142 was PCR amplified and substituted for the FRB module between BglII and AgeI sites , adding a Gly - Ser - Gly - Ser - Gly linker at the 3’ end . The GFP - PLC d 1 PH domain PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 sensor and construction of the GFP - Hs FCHO1 ( 1 – 609 ) and ( 1 - 467 ) plasmids have been described ( Umasankar et al . , 2014 ) . pCAG _ EGFP - GFE3 ( plasmid # 79869 ) ( Gross et al . , 2016 ) was obtained from Addgene . To replace the central FingR domain with Nb E _ 142 , PCR using primers that allowed cloning of the Nb between MfeI and BglII sites ( Table 1 ) was used . All plasmid constructs were verified by automated double - stranded dideoxynucleotide sequenc - ing ( Genewiz ) . Full sequence details and maps are available upon request . Recombinant protein purification GST fusion proteins were synthesized in the E . coli BL21 codon plus RIL strain ( Invitrogen ) . After transformation , GST and all GST - fusion proteins were purified by a standardized protocol involving induction of cultures grown in 2 x YT medium at 37˚C to an OD 600 of ~ 0 . 6 – 0 . 8 with 100 m M IPTG at 18˚C overnight . Bacteria were then collected by centrifugation ( 15 , 300 x g max , 4˚C , 10 min ) and pel - lets resuspended in a 3 : 1 mixture of B - PER and Y - PER ( Thermo - Fisher ) with 0 . 25 mg / ml freshly pre - pared hen egg lysozyme and 50 U / ml benzonase nuclease ( Sigma ) . During resuspension , PMSF was added to 1 mM from a 200 mM stock solution in isopropanol . The bacterial suspension was centri - fuged ( 27 , 000 x g max , 4˚C , 15 min ) and then the supernatant fraction collected and incubated batch wise at 4˚C with continuous up - and - down mixing of 0 . 5 – 2 . 0 ml added glutathione - Sepharose ( GE ) , as required . After initial washing of the Sepharose with ice - cold PBS by centrifugation , the beads were transferred to a disposable polypropylene column on ice and washed with ~ 10 column volumes of PBS . Bound GST / GST - fusion proteins were eluted with 25 mM Tris - HCl , 250 mM sodium chloride , 10 mM reduced glutathione and 2 mM DTT on ice . Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed into PBS at 4˚C . Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method with BSA as the stan - dard and aliquots stored at (cid:0) 80˚C . Nb production , screening and purification For the generation of the Nb clones , immunization , library construction and screening was carried out by the Nanobody Service Facility at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel , Belgium . The entire procedure was as described in detail ( Vincke et al . , 2012 ) . Briefly , a single llama was inoculated six times over a 35 day period with a mixture of 250 m g purified Hs EPS15 ( 1 - 314 ) and Gerbu adjuvant P . Purified lymphocytes from blood collected on day 39 were used to isolate mRNA for cDNA synthesis by RT - PCR with and oligo ( dT ) primer . The immune nanobody library construction utilized this cDNA and appropriate primers to amplify V H H antigen specific sequences . PCR products were digested with PstI and NotI for subcloning into the phagemid vector pMECS . From the library of ~ 3 (cid:2) 10 8 trans - formants , 97 % ( 93 of 95 clones ) had correctly sized inserts and sequencing confirmed the presence of germ line V H H sequences . Antigen - specific clones were identified by solid phase biopanning E . coli TG1 infected with the library using 200 m g / ml of the immunizing EPS15 ( 1 - 314 ) immobilized on plates . After two sequential rounds of selection of phagemid particles , 14 specific clones were obtained , which sequencing revealed corresponded to seven individual V H H sequences .

Bacteria were initially grown at 37˚C to an OD 600 of ~ 0 . 8 – 1 . 0 in LB supplemented with 0 . 1 % glucose , 2 mM magnesium chloride and ampicillin and then IPTG added to a final concentration of 1 mM before incubation overnight at 28˚C . Large - scale inductions were carried out similarly but using 500 ml cultures . Bacte - ria were collected by centrifugation ( 9000 x g max , 4˚C , 15 min ) and resuspended in ice - cold TES buffer ( 200 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 500 mM sucrose ) . The bacterial suspension was incubated at 4˚C with continual vigorous mixing at 250 rpm on an orbital shaker for ~ 60 min before addition of 2 volumes of 1 / 4 - strength TES ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 125 mM EDTA , 125 mM sucrose ) . After an additional 60 – 90 min incubation at 4˚C with continual mixing at 250 rpm , the bac - teria were pelleted by centrifugation at 10 , 000 (cid:2) g max at 4˚C for 30 min and the supernatant ( peri - plasmic extract ) aspirated and stored in aliquots at (cid:0) 80˚C . Before use in biochemical binding assays , samples of periplasmic extract were adjusted to 125 mM sodium chloride by addition of 1 / 40 vol of a 5 M stock solution on ice and then centrifuged at ~ 125 , 000 x g max ( 45 , 000 rpm , Beckman TLA 55 rotor ) at 4˚C for 20 min . Aliquots of the clarified supernants were added to immobilized GST / GST - fusion proteins bound to washed glutathione - Sepharose beads for pull - down assays . To purify the Nb E _ 142 - His 6 protein from periplasmic extract , the protein was first purified over a 1 . 5 mL column Ni - NTA - agarose ( MC Labs ) , eluted with 500 mM imidazole , concentrated to 5 ml using an Amicon Ultra 15 device with a 3000 nominal molecular weight limit and then 2 . 5 ml fraction - ated at 0 . 8 ml / min in the upward direction over a HiLoad Sephacryl S - 100 HR column ( 16 (cid:2) 60 mm , GE ) equilibrated in 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 150 mM sodium chloride . Peak 2 ml fractions identified by SDS - PAGE were pooled , and concentrated with an Amicon Ultra device to ~ 4 ml with a protein concentration of ~ 1 . 75 mg / ml . Aliquots of the purified Nb E _ 142 were stored at (cid:0) 80˚C . For biochemical interaction assays , first , purified GST or the appropriate GST - fusion protein ( 25 – 200 m g ) was immobilized on 25 m l of packed glutathione - Sepharose ( GE ) by incubation in 750 m l PBS at 4˚C for ~ 2 hr with continual mixing . The beads were then recovered by centrifugation at 10 , 000 x g max for 1 min and washed into either PBS or assay buffer ( 25 mM Hepes - KOH , pH 7 . 2 , 125 mM potassium acetate , 5 mM magnesium acetate , 2 mM EDTA , 2 mM EGTA and 2 mM DTT ) and resus - pended to a total volume of 50 m l in residual wash buffer . Clarified periplasmic extract or HeLa cell Triton X - 100 lysate was added to the washed beads and incubation continued at 4˚C for 60 min with continuous up - and - down mixing . The beads were again sedimented by centrifugation ( 10 , 000 x g max , 1 min ) and a 70 m l aliquot of each supernatant fraction removed and transferred to a new microfuge tube on ice . After aspirating the remainder of each supernatant , the pellets were washed 4 x with 1 . 5 ml / wash ice - cold PBS and then the Sepharose bead pellet resuspended in SDS sample buffer to a final volume of 100 m l . After briefly boiling , aliquots of 2 % of each supernatant and 10 % of each supernatant were resolved by SDS - PAGE and either stained with Coomassie brilliant blue in 40 % methanol , 10 % acetic acid or transferred to nitrocellulose in a cold buffer of 15 . 6 mM Tris , 120 mM glycine at 110V for 75 min . After staining the blots with 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) Ponceau S in 5 % acetic acid ( Sigma ) to identify and mark the molecular mass standards , the nitrocellulose was cut into appropri - ate replicate sections , destained in transfer buffer , and blocked overnight in 5 % non - fat milk powder in TBST ( 25 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM sodium chloride , 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ) at room temperature . Quantitative binding assays ( Pollard , 2010 ) were performed at 4˚C for 60 min in PBS containing 100 m g / ml carrier BSA . The final assay volume was 400 m l , to allow calculation of molarities using the molecular weights of 13 , 683 . 2 for Nb E _ 142 - His 6 , 26 , 200 for GST , 38 , 271 . 3 for GST - Hs EPS15 ( 1 – 109 / EH1 ) and 60 , 924 . 7 for GST - Hs EPS15 ( 1 – 314 / EH1 - 3 ) . The Nb E _ 142 concentration was fixed at 2 m M and GST - Hs EPS15 ( 1 - 109 ) varied from 0 . 5 to 20 m M while ( 1 - 314 ) was titrated over the range 0 . 25 – 10 m M . The intensity of the Nb E _ 142 band in the supernatant fractions , collected under equi - librium conditions ( Pollard , 2010 ) , was determined with ImageJ / Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ; Rueden et al . , 2017 ) and data normalized to the Nb E _ 142 found in the GST control supernatant fraction . A complete list of the primary antibodies used in this study are provided in Table 2 . Primary anti - bodies were diluted in 1 % non - fat milk in TBST and typically incubated with the nitrocellulose - immo - bilized protein antigens at room temperature for 2 hr . After thorough washing with TBST , appropriate HRP - conjugated anti - mouse / rabbit / goat antibodies ( Amersham / GE Healthcare ) diluted in 1 % milk in TBST were added and incubated at room temperature for 60 min .

Cells lines and tissue culture The parental cell line HeLa SS6 ( Elbashir et al . , 2001 ) , derived from the female cervical adenocarci - noma HeLa line , has the characteristic compact , dense epithelial morphology and was verified of H . sapiens origin by sequencing results ( Umasankar et al . , 2014 ) . Cell line authentication using autoso - mal short tandem repeats ( STRs ) by the University of Arizona Genetics Core coincides with HeLa above an 80 % match threshold . The HeLa SS clone # 64 / 1 . E ( clone 1 . E cells ) were produced previ - ously by sequential TALEN - mediated gene disruption of the FCHO2 locus on chromosome five and the FCHO1 locus on chromosome 19 ( Umasankar et al . , 2014 ) . TALEN - mediated generation of clones # 15 , # 19 and # 40 from the # 64 / 1 . E line was as we have described ; assembly of the TALEN arrays ( Joung and Sander , 2013 ) , transfection and selection were by the procedures outlined ( Umasankar et al . , 2014 ) . All HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM , Lonza ) supplemented with 10 % FCS ( Atlanta Biologicals ) and 2 mM L - glutamine ( Gibco ) in a humidified 5 % CO 2 atmosphere at 37˚C . K - 652 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supple - mented with 5 % FCS and 2 mM L - glutamine at 37˚C .

Cells tested negative for mycoplasma using a PCR - based assay , and were rou - tinely discarded after no more than 30 passages . Triton X - 100 whole cell lysates were prepared from parental HeLa SS6 cells cultured in at least 5 (cid:2) 15 cm Petri dishes and collected into CellStripper dissociation reagent ( Corning ) . For transfections , Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) was used . First , media from the cells plated in 35 mm culture dishes or 6 - well trays was aspirated and replenished with 2 ml of fresh DMEM , 10 % FCS , 2 mM glutamine . Aliquots of the appropriate endotoxin - free mini / midiprep plasmid DNA ( 0 . 4 – 1 . 0 m g ) diluted into 375 m l Opti - MEM ( Gibco ) were incubated at room temperature for ~ 15 min with occasional mixing before addition of 5 m l of the Lipofectamine 2000 stock solution to each tube of DNA . After incubation at room temperature for an additional ~ 45 min , the transfection mixture was added drop wise to the cells and incubated at 37˚C overnight in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO 2 . After 16 – 20 hr , cells were used for endocytosis assays or either fixed for morphological analysis or processed for immunoblotting . Cells were detached by incubation at room temperature with Cell - Stripper and collected into microfuge tubes on ice . After rinsing the dishes with PBS and pooling with the CellStripper suspension , cells were recovered by centrifugation ( 500 (cid:2) g max for 5 min at 4˚ C ) and the supernatants aspirated and discarded . Each pellet was resuspended in hot SDS sample buffer and boiled before analysis by SDS - PAGE . For transferrin uptake assays , cells on cover slips were first incubated in a starvation medium com - posed of DMEM , 25 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 2 , 0 . 5 % BSA and 2 mM L - glutamine , for 60 min at 37˚C in 5 % CO 2 to discharge intact apotransferrin from surface transferrin receptors . For the 5 min pulse experi - ments , cells were incubated in 500 m l starvation medium supplemented with 25 m g / ml Alexa Fluor 568 - conjugated human transferrin ( Life Technologies / Thermo Fisher ) at 37˚C , then placed immedi - ately into an ice / water bath and rapidly washed three times with ice - cold PBS before fixation in ice - cold 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) in PBS on ice for 10 min . For the modified uptake assay ( Reis et al . , 2015 ) , starved HeLa clone # 40 cells were incubated 25 m g / ml Alexa Fluor 568 - transferrin in 500 m l at 37˚C for 2 min , transferred to an ice / water bath and washed three times with 0 . 2 M acetic acid , 0 . 5 M sodium chloride , pH 2 . 5 ( Lamb et al . , 1983 ) . Then 500 m l of warmed starvation medium was added to the cells and incubation continued at 37˚C for a further 2 min before fixation in paraformadehyde on ice . Immunofluorescence analysis After removing culture medium , cells attached to 12 mm round glass cover slips were fixed in ice - cold 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS on ice for 10 min . The cells were then washed three times with ice - cold PBS before incubation in 5 % normal goat serum ( Sigma ) , 0 . 2 % saponin ( Sigma ) in PBS at room temperature for at least 30 min . For incubation with primary antibodies , appropriate dilutions were prepared in 5 % normal goat serum , 0 . 2 % saponin in PBS and centrifuged at 15 , 000 (cid:2) g max for 10 min before addition to the fixed and permabilized cells . Incubation with primary antibodies was for 60 min at room temperature , followed by three washes with PBS . Fluorochrome - coupled second - ary antibodies ( Invitrogen ) were similarly diluted ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) in 5 % normal goat serum , 0 . 2 % saponin in PBS and centrifuged at 15 , 000 (cid:2) g max for 10 min before addition of aliquots of the clarified superna - tant to the cells . For double transfection experiments involving both iRFP and GFP , where the effi - ciency of GFP expression is sharply reduced , an anti - GFP nanobody ( GFP - Booster , Chromotek ) conjugated to Atto 488 was used to detect GFP - expressing cells unambiguously . After incubation at room temperature for 30 – 45 min , the cells were washed three times with PBS , in some cases incu - bated briefly in 2 m g / ml Hoechst 33258 DNA dye in PBS , and mounted on glass slides in either Cyto - seal ( Thermo Fisher ) or SlowFade Diamond ( Life Technologies ) mounting medium . Confocal microscopy and image processing All images were acquired using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope equipped with a 60 (cid:2) PlanApo ( NA 1 . 42 ) oil objective lens and controlled by the Olympus Fluoview FV1 - ASW 4 . 1 software . Fluorochromes were excited with the laser bench combiner as follows : a 405 nm laser for Hoechst , the 488 nm laser for Alexa Fluor 488 , Atto 488 , GFP and mNG , the 559 nm laser for Alexa Fluor 546 and (cid:0) 567 , and the 635 nm laser for Alexa Fluor 647 .

Sequential z - stacks were collected with a 0 . 3 m m - step size between sections . Minor adjustments to intensity and contrast were performed in Adobe Photo - shop CC and composite images were assembled and annotated in Adobe Illustrator CC . Quantitation of fluorescence confocal images was similar to that described previously ( Ma et al . , 2016 ) , but performed using the Nikon NIS Elements 5 . 11 . 01 analysis package . In some cases , confo - cal z - stack images were first deconvoluted and assembled into a single maximum - projection image as previously described ( Ma et al . , 2016 ) . For all images , after threshold - based background correc - tion of raw files , a binary mask of objects was generated by processing for punctate structures ( using the Advanced Denoising and Detect Regional Maxima function ) , and then individual statistics for object size computed . Fluorescence intensity measurements were determined by analyzing full 3D volumes , again by using the Denoising function , smoothing , deconvolution , and 3D binary threshold - ing and segmentation in NIS Elements . The original transferrin channel was then quantified using the process - generated mask . In the 1 , 024 (cid:2) 1 , 024 pixel images acquired with the FV1000 60 (cid:2) objective and 2 (cid:2) magnification , the individual pixel size is 0 . 103 nm . For comparisons in the transiently - transfected cell image data sets , region - of - interest segmentation was performed on the basis of the distribution of the fluorescence signal in transfected cell marker channel . Counted objects were classified into area - based or volume - based category bins as described previously ( Ma et al . , 2016 ) . In most instances , comparable total cell areas were compared , as stated in the individual figure legends . Usually , five separate data sets were analyzed , and the data combined for presentation in the figures . Dot / boxplots were generated using PlotsOfData ( Postma and Goed - hart , 2019 ) .
