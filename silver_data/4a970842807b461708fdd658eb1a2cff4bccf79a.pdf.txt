Over the past ﬁve years , an increasing number of studies have clearly described the importance of this highly metabolically active commensal bacterium as a component of the healthy human microbiota . Changes in the abundance of F . prausnitzii have been linked to dysbiosis in several human disorders . Administration of F . prausnitzii strain A2 - 165 and its culture supernatant have been shown to protect against 2 , 4 , 6 - trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid ( TNBS ) - induced colitis in mice .

Current Opinion in Microbiology 2013 , 16 : xx – yy This review comes from a themed issue on Ecology and industrial microbiology Edited by Jerry Wells and Philippe Langella 1369 - 5274 / $ – see front matter , Published by Elsevier Ltd . http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . mib . 2013 . 06 . 003 Fa ecalibacterium prausnitzii , a dominant member of the healthy human colon microbiota Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was initially classiﬁed as Fuso - bacterium prausnitzii , but in 1996 , the complete sequence of the 16s rRNA gene of different human strains ( ATCC 27766 and ATCC 27768 ) established that they were only distantly related to Fusobacterium and were more closely related to members of Clostridium cluster IV ( the Clos - tridium leptum group ) [ 1 , 2 ] . The new nomenclature was deﬁnitively adopted in 2002 , when Duncan et al . [ 3 ] proposed that a new genus Faecalibacterium be created to include the non - spore - forming and non - motile Gram positive bacterium named Faecalibacterium pauznitzii ( for - merly Fusobacterium prausnitzii ) . Today , F . prausnitzii species are a major representative of Firmicutes phylum , Clostridium class , Ruminococcaceae family . She ﬁrst complete genome of the F . prausnitzii reference strain A2 - 165 ( DSM17677 ) was sequenced in 2010 in the frame of the ‘Human Microbiome Project’ . Four other complete F . prausnitzii genomes have been then sequenced ( SL3 / 3 , L2 / 6 , M21 / 2 and KLE1255 ) but the annotations are still incomplete . Sequenced . F . prausnitzii strains appear to lack plasmids and have circular 2 . 93 to 3 . 32 Mb chromosomes with an average GC content between 47 and 57 % and are predicted to encode around 3000 pre - dicted proteins . In humans , the Faecalibacterium genus is divided into two different phylogroups [ 4 (cid:2) ] although it is not known if they have different physiological functions . Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) revealed that the reference strain A2 - 165 ( DSM17677 ) is a long bacillus of around 2 m m with rounded ends ( Figure 1 ) . We observed cell wall extensions , like ‘swellings’ that have not been previously described in this species . Interestingly , the same morphotype was also observed in other F . prausnitzii strains from the same phylogroup ( data not shown ) . F . prausnitzii is an extremely oxygen sensitive ( EOS ) bacterium and is difﬁcult to cultivate even in anaerobic conditions [ 3 ] . The major end products of glucose fer - mentation by F . prausnitzii strains are formate , small amounts of D - lactate ( L - lactate being undetectable ) and substantial quantities of butyrate ( > 10 mM butyrate in vitro ) [ 3 , 5 ] . Recently , culture medium supplemented with ﬂavins and cysteine or glutathione was shown to support growth of F . prausnitzii under micro - aerobic conditions [ 6 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . In the future , it may be possible to generate metabolic maps from genome annotations and transcriptomics data under different fermentative con - ditions and thereby identify other components that can be added to the medium to enhance growth in vitro . Such approaches might permit to increase the viability of F . prausnitzii under micro - aerobic conditions and open up possibilities to develop novel probiotic formulations . F . prausnitzii is a dominant member of the subgroup C . leptum , the second most represented in fecal samples ( after the C . coccoides group ) corresponding to (cid:3) 21 % of all prokaryotic cells [ 7 ] . It is now generally accepted that F . prausnitzii accounts for approximately 5 % , of the total fecal microbiota in healthy adults but this can increase to around 15 % in some individuals [ 8 ] . F . prausnitzii is Available online at www . sciencedirect . com www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Microbiology 2013 , 16 : 1 – 7 widely distributed in the Gastrointestinal Tract ( GIT ) of other mammals such pigs [ 9 ] , mice [ 10 ] and calves [ 11 ] as well as poultry [ 12 , 13 ] , and the insect cockroach [ 14 ] . The abundance and ubiquity of F . prausnitzii suggest that it is a functionally important member of the microbiota with a possible impact on host physiology and health . Changes in the abundance of fecal C . leptum group , and in particular F . prausnitzii , have been extensively described in differ - ent human intestinal and metabolic diseases . F . prausnitzii : an highly metabolic bacteria of the microbiota Li et al . [ 15 (cid:2) ] demonstrated that F . prausnitzii population variation is associated with modulation of eight urinary metabolites of diverse structure , indicating that this species is one of the highly functionally active members of the microbiome [ 15 (cid:2) ] . However , it seems important to better investigate the role of F . prausnitzii metabolism on intestinal homeostasis also considering the crosstalk with the other members of microbiota . The recently described gnotobiotic models for F . prausnitzii will be useful in discovering effects on the host and its interactions with other species [ 16 (cid:2) ] . Morover , F . prausnitzii is one of the most abundant butyrate - producing bacterium in the GIT [ 17 ] . Butyrate plays a major role in gut physiology and it has pleiotropic effects in intestinal cell life cycle and numerous beneﬁcial effects for health through protection against pathogen invasion , modulation of immune system and reduction of cancer progression [ 18 ] . In addition , butyrate is proposed to have anti - inﬂammatory activities in the colon mucosa [ 19 ] . For instance , intra - rectal delivery of butyrate producing bacteria has been previously shown to prevent colitis [ 20 ] . Thus , by producing butyrate in the gut , F . prausnitzii may impact on physiological functions and homeostasis to maintain health . However , speciﬁc phys - iological and health effects of butyrate production by F . prausnitzii have not yet been demonstrated [ 21 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . F . prausnitzii : a sensor of health ? Most data linking abundance of F . prausnitzii to health status come from 16S rRNA based proﬁling of microbiota in inﬂammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) of which there is three types Crohn’s disease ( CD ) , ulcerative colitis ( UC ) and Pouchitis . Table 1 summarizes the variation of relative abundance of F . prausnitzii in fecal or mucosal samples from IBD patients compared to healthy subjects , using different methods . The data reveal that the relative abundance of F . prausnitzii can serve as an indicator or biomarker of intestinal health in adults and low levels could be predictive for CD . CD are notably classiﬁed according disease location ( ileal CD : ICD , colonic CD : CCD ) and it has been shown that CD - associated dysbio - sis is not the same in patients with or without ileal involvement . Indeed , F . prausnitzii deﬁciency was ﬁrst shown in ICD patients [ 21 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . It has been thus demon - strated that low F . prausnitzii level in ICD undergoing surgery is associated with a higher risk of post - operative recurrence [ 21 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . In 2008 , Swidsinski et al . [ 23 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] pro - posed a diagnostic test based on F . prausnitzii prevalence and leukocyte count features to distinguish active CD from UC with good sensitivity ( 79 – 80 % sensitivity and 98 – 100 % speciﬁcity respectively ) . In fact , F . prausnitzii depletion ( < 1 . 10 9 mL (cid:4) 1 ) along with normal leukocyte counts ( > 30 leukocytes / 10 4 m m 2 ) is typical in CD , but not UC patients , where a massive increase of leukocyte counts together with high F . prausnitzii numbers is observed [ 23 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Moreover , even if the host genotype partially determines the microbial community compo - sition in the human gut , concordance of the disease in monozygotic twins is less than 50 % indicating that environmental factors play a key role [ 24 ] . In fact , bac - terial infection - driven dysbiosis and environmental fac - tors are correlated to IBD characterized by an imbalance of mucosal protective bacteria shared by bacteria from the C . leptum group including F . prausnitzii [ 22 ] . However , microbiota proﬁling in cohorts of patients means we cannot determine which came ﬁrst the disease or a change in the microbiome . Long - term longitudinal studies in prospective cohorts will be required to establish a causal link between changes in the microbiota and disease progression . The effects of IBD treatments on F . prausnitzii popu - lation levels are still unclear , but some show a positive impact on F . prausnitzii population in the microbiota . For instance , Rifaximin ( reported to induce clinical remission in patients with active CD ) is associated with an increased level of Biﬁdobacteria and F . prausnitzii [ 25 ] . Other speciﬁc treatments such as chemotherapy and interferon a - 2b were shown to reverse the depletion of F . prausnitzii [ 26 ] . Moreover , a high - dose cortisol therapy or Inﬂiximab can completely restore F . prausnitzii concentrations from zero to higher levels than 1 . 4 (cid:5) 10 10 bacteria / mL within few days [ 23 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . This observation suggests that the depletion of F . prausnitzii in active CD is not a causative 2 Ecology and industrial microbiology COMICR - 1112 ; NO .

How - ever , as F . prausnitzii has been shown to exhibit both in vitro and in vivo anti - inﬂammatory effects [ 21 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] , a negative effect of a decrease of F . prausnitzii levels cannot be completely ruled out and suggests that this bacterium might also con - tribute to homeostasis in a healthy gut . In fact , we recently showed in the ﬁrst gnotobiotic model with F . prausnitzii that it could inﬂuence gut physiology through mucus pathway and the production of mucus O - glycans [ 16 (cid:2) ] . Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) The intestinal microbiota of IBS patients differed signiﬁ - cantly from that of healthy subjects with a twofold increased in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio [ 27 ] . A negative correlation has been observed between the abundance of Faecalibacterium - related bacteria and IBS symptoms . IBS - A ( alternating - type IBS ) patients have signiﬁcantly lower levels of Faecalibacterium spp . This is a common signature found in IBS - associated and IBD - associated microbiota which provides a molecular basis for the observation that some features of IBS , such as micro - inﬂammation , are shared with IBD , particularly during remission periods [ 27 ] . In contrast to IBS - A , F . prausnitzii is not modiﬁed in IBS - D ( diarrhea - predomi - nant ) and is notably lower or not modiﬁed in IBS - C ( constipation - predominant IBS ) patients [ 27 – 29 ] . This observation suggests that only the IBS - A form is associ - ated with lower F . prausnitzii counts . Obesity While a connection between microbiota and obesity - related disorders has been established , the underlying mechanisms and microbiota changes are still poorly understood [ 30 ] . The ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes is altered in overweight and obese subjects but not others . In addition , the presence of F . prausnitzii species has been linked to the reduction of low - grade inﬂammation in obesity and diabetes independently of caloric intake [ 31 , 32 ] . However , F . prausnitzii levels were signiﬁcantly higher in south Indian obese children than in non - obese participants [ 33 ] . Owing to the inconsistencies in correlating F . prausnitzii with obesity in different cohorts , its role in this metabolic disorder is still uncertain and requires further studies [ 31 , 32 ] . Coeliac disease This is a chronic inﬂammatory disorder of the small intestine , characterized by a permanent intolerance to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals .

Interestingly , a similar trend was detected in duodenal biopsies of untreated or treated coeliac disease children compared with controls [ 36 ] . Different hypotheses could explain these changes : ﬁrstly , the activation of the adaptive and innate immune response ; and / or secondly , the reduction in polysaccharides intake , since these dietary compounds usually reach the distal part of the colon , and constitute one of the main energy sources for beneﬁcial components of gut microbiota . Other diseases Fecal abundance of F . prausnitzii has also been analyzed in other diseases such as self limited colitis [ 22 ] , atopic diseases [ 37 ] , chronic idiopathic diarrhea [ 38 ] , acute appendicitis [ 39 ] , neuroendocrine tumors of the midgut [ 26 ] , liver transplantation [ 40 ] and colorectal cancer ( CRC ) [ 41 ] . On the basis of the huge quantity of scientiﬁc data in diseased and healthy subjects we conclude that F . prausnitzii abundance in the microbiota is a good intestinal health indicator , except in UC patients . This was surprising given the clear relationship between active disease in CD patients and low abundance of F . prausnitzii . Moreover , most studies give support to the notion that this bacterium is very sensitive to its environment ; its proportion negatively corre - lates with the presence of acute or moderate inﬂammation . A systematic evaluation of F . prausnitzii in patients feces , based on the analysis of the gut microbiota or components of the microbiota , could be useful to develop therapeutic strategies and personalized medicine . However , the routine diagnostic tools to detect F . prausnitzii dysbiosis in clinical laboratories are not yet developed and due to its sensitivity to the oxygen , molecular detection techniques will need to be developed as prognostic markers of disease therapy . Possible mechanisms of F . prausnitzii anti - inﬂammatory effects F . prausnitzii and its culture supernatant can attenuate 2 , 4 , 6 - trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid ( TNBS ) - induced colitis in mice [ 21 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . This highlights its potential to be exploited as a therapeutic for IBD but until now , the 4 Ecology and industrial microbiology COMICR - 1112 ; NO .

The supernatant of F . prausnitzii blocks NF - k B activation induced by a pro - inflammatory stimulus [ 21 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . 2 . Butyrate produced by F . prausnitzii inhibits NF - k B activation in mucosal biopsies . 3 . F . prausnitzii components might interact with CD103 + dendritic cells ( DCs ) in the lamina propria and stimulate their migration to mesenteric lymph nodes ( MLN ) and the induction of Tregs . 4 . M cell transcytosis of F . prausnitzii in organized lymphoid structures may induce Tregs . 5 . The capacity of F . prausnitzii to induce high amounts of IL - 10 in antigen presenting cells may enhance the suppressive activity of Foxp3 + Tregs and block Th17 cells induced by pro - inflammatory stimuli .

One possible mechanism is attributed to secreted component ( s ) of F . prausnitzii culture super - natant that inhibited NF - k B activation and IL - 8 secretion induced by IL - 1 b in Caco - 2 cells ( Figure 2 ) [ 21 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . The production of butyrate was shown to have only a slight impact in the suppression of inﬂammation by live F . prausnitzii in the mouse TNBS colitis model [ 21 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . This suggests that another metabolite or factor produced during anaerobic growth would play a major role . We are currently searching for these factors using metabolomic , biochemical and genetic approaches . Further studies are needed to determine whether such anti - inﬂammatory factor can attenuate the NF - k B acti - vation in immune cells and primary epithelial cells which would provide further evidence for its role in prevention of colitis . Other possible mechanisms con - tributing to the protective effect of F . prausnitzii in colitis might be related to its capacity to induce rela - tively large amounts of IL - 10 and low amounts of IL - 12 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [ 21 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . If F . prausnitzii also induces large amounts of IL - 10 in muco - sal dendritic cells and macrophages , it may contribute to intestinal homeostasis by inhibiting the production of pro - inﬂammatory cytokines such as IFN - g , TNF - a , IL - 6 and IL - 12 and enhancing the suppressive activity of Foxp3 + Tregs in the mucosa [ 42 ] ( Figure 2 ) . The induction of IL - 10 in immune cells by F . prausnitzii may also play a role in shaping T cells responses , in particular in the induction of Tregs in the colon as described for certain other commensals [ 43 – 45 ] . More - over , the amount of TLR4 in human intestinal DCs is negatively correlated with F . prausnitzii level suggesting that intestinal DC function may be inﬂuenced by this bacterium [ 46 ] . Conclusion F . prausnitzii , is a major EOS component of the intestinal microbiota which has been largely ignored until recently . Its low prevalence in many intestinal disorders , particu - larly in IBD patients , suggests its potential as an indicator of intestinal health . F . prausnitzii is a butyrate producer and has demonstrated anti - inﬂammatory effects in vitro and in vivo using a mouse colitis model making it a key member of the microbiota that may contribute to intes - tinal homeostasis . Thus , modulation of F . prausnitzii abundance , for example using prebiotics and / or probiotics and / or formulations that permit survival through the upper part of the intestinal tract might have prophylactic or therapeutic applications in human health . For instance , the ﬁber inulin has well - characterized impact on micro - biota composition inducing speciﬁc and signiﬁcant increase in Biﬁdobacterium and F . prausnitzii [ 47 , 48 ] . Moreover the rapid detection of F . prausnitzii abundance in feces warrants further investigation as a biomarker of intestinal health . Experimental procedures Scanning electron microscopy Scanning electron microscopy analyses were performed on the MIMA2 platform ( INRA , Massy , France ) . 1 mL of pure culture in LYBHI medium was pelleted , resus - pended and then ﬁxed in 200 m l of glutaraldehyde , 3 % ruthenium red for two hours in an anaerobic chamber and then stored at 4 8 C .
