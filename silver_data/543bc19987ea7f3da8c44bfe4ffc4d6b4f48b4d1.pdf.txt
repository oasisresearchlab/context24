The pandemic brought a severe socioeconomic shock - decreasing economic activity - and forced policy responses that affected the education sector - notably school closures - . There is scarce evidence on the implications of the pandemic and its socioeconomic conse - quences on learning inequality , particularly in the Latin - American context . The aim of this paper is to measure the change in learning inequality during the years of the pandemic ( 2020 – 2021 ) in Colombia . To measure learning inequality , we use the results of a standardize exam taken by all upper secondary education graduates in the country . To capture inequality , we use secondary - level students ’ characteristics , their households , and schools ’ characteristics . Our econometric results suggest an increase in learning inequality between 48 % and 372 % depending on the dimension studied , except for gender where learning inequality decreased . Moreover , through dynamic specifications , we determine that for all the analyzed dimensions the 2020 – 2021 period rep - resents a change in the trend of learning inequality as in the periods prior to the pandemic inequality gaps decreased or , at least , remained constant . We conclude with concrete and immediate policy recommendations to target the learning processes of vulnerable students and bridge learning gaps . 1 . Introduction The first cases of Covid - 19 in Colombia were reported in early March 2020 . Shortly , the authorities decided to begin a preventive isolation policy , and declared it mandatory as from March 25th , 2020 . The mandatory preventive isolation plan included a set of health measures and major changes at the economic and social levels in order to control the spread of Covid - 19 . Progressively and by phases , certain industries and sectors were able to reopen with the purpose of mitigating the economic crisis . Until the 1st of September 2020 the government began a pilot authorizing few economic sectors to reopen with any mobility restrictions . Lockdowns stopped the production and economic activity of various sectors , and significantly decreased the national output : the Colombian GDP decreased 7 . 3 % in 2020 , particularly during the second quarter ( April - June ) it decreased 15 . 7 % ( DANE , 2023 ) . The magnitude of the impacts of the pandemic were disproportionately large for vulnerable population groups ( DANE , 2023 ) . The preventive isolation policy included school closures . In Latin America , school closures lasted 70 % longer than in OECD 1 countries ( OECD et al . , 2021 ) , despite the lack of evidence that closures were indeed an effective health measure ( Heavey et al . , 2020 ; Rajmil , 2020 ) . In Colombia in particular , most of the schools remained closed during ☆ This article is the result of a project led by Sandra García and Darío Maldonado in partnership with Universidad de Los Andes and the Fundaci ´ on Barco who financed Lucas Marín Llanes and Mariana Rodríguez Pico .

Furthermore , the return to in person classes took place with significant differences across municipalities in timing and number of students benefiting from reopening . 2 This is especially problematic in the Colombian context , like other Latin American countries , because before the pandemic a high proportion of students had learning gaps , as well as significant learning inequalities related to the socioeconomic characteristics of the students . In this context of uneven affectations during Covid - 19 and the implemented policies , in this paper we explore the changes in learning inequalities in Colombia during the years of the pandemic . The costs in the education attainment of children and adolescents caused by the pandemic have been unevenly distributed . The United Nations ( 2020 ) argued that during the pandemic there was a decrease in the educational opportunities for the most vulnerable students , such as for those living in poverty , those living in rural areas , women , displaced persons , among others . Similarly , households with limited access to electronic devices faced difficulties in supporting children and adolescents in their learning process ( Valle , 2020 ) . The learning loss for students with lower perfor - mance prior to the pandemic is greater than for the rest of the students ( Angrist et al . , 2021 ) . In the United States , after three months of school closures , it was found that low - income students reduced their scores and performance by 36 % , while high - income students increased their scores by 45 . 5 % in the same period ( Opportunity Insights Economic Tracker , 2020 ) . Uneven learning loss will have long - term consequences for human capital accumulation ( Azevedo et al . , 2020 ) . Thus , it is necessary to measure student ’ s learning outcomes and assess whether or not inequality gaps increased during the pandemic in Colombia . The latter contributes to the design of mechanisms to target the learning process of vulnerable students and mitigate the long - term consequences mentioned above . In this paper we measure how learning inequality changed in the period 2016 – 2021 to determine whether inequality is statistically different between the pre - pandemic years ( 2016 – 2019 ) and the pandemic years ( 2020 – 2021 ) . We use data from the National Stan - dardized Scholastic Aptitude Test for high school seniors in Colombia , called Saber 11 , which is a compulsory test for all secondary education graduates in Colombia . In most countries standardized tests were not implemented during the pandemic ; while Colombia managed to implement the test despite the difficulties implied by the health shock . We use four dimensions to quantify these gaps in educational learning : individual ( gender and ethnicity ) , household ( socioeconomic status ) , schools ( sector and area ) and municipality ( a categorization of munic - ipalities according to permanent violence exposure and poverty rates – Programas de desarrollo territorial , PDET ) . 3 Using econometric models , controlling for observable factors of students and their environments , and for time - invariant unobservable characteristics of schools , we esti - mate the change in learning inequality gaps associated with each dimension and with the years of the pandemic ( 2020 – 2021 ) . Moreover , through dynamic specifications , we determine that for all the analyzed dimensions the 2020 – 2021 period presents a change in the trend of learning inequality as in the periods prior to the pandemic inequality gaps decreased or , at least , remained constant . These empirical findings push forward our argument on the widening of inequality gaps specif - ically during the years of the pandemic . We find that gender inequality decreased by 17 . 9 % during the Covid - 19 period . Conversely , for all other characteristics of interest , inequality increased dramatically . The estimate percentage changes range from 48 % ( household socioeconomic status ) to 372 % ( school area ) inequality increases . This paper contributes to the literature by documenting how the pandemic and all its socioeconomic consequences affected education processes . Evidence prior to the Covid - 19 pandemic documented the effects of school closures due to holidays , teacher strikes , wars , natural disasters , or four - day school week showing negative and persistent ef - fects on student performance ( Andrabi et al . , 2020 ; Busso and Camacho , 2020 ; Thompson and Ward , 2022 ) . In the context of this pandemic , it has been estimated that closing schools for one - third of the school year reduces student learning by one whole year and reduces enrollment rates ( Angrist et al . , 2021 ; Chatterji and Li , 2021 ; Engzell et al . , 2020 ; Kaffenberger , 2021 ; Maldonado and De Witte , 2020 ) . In developing countries , such as Mexico and South Africa , the learning loss caused by school closures has also been quantified ( Ardington et al . , 2021 ; Hevia et al . , 2022 ) . These studies show that in absence of remedial in - terventions , the learning loss will accumulate because students did not acquire the knowledge expected by the training programs , and , without adjustments , students will face substantial knowledge gaps . The result - ing long - term costs are of unprecedented magnitude . Estimates of the economic impact of pandemic closures , smaller in magnitude than Colombia ’ s , show long - term economic losses up to $ 10 billion ( Azevedo et al . , 2021 ) . This paper also contributes to the literature by measuring how un - evenly distributed were the educational costs of the pandemic , affecting disproportionately the most vulnerable students . In other countries , there is evidence of the drop of standardized test scores , reductions in enrollment rates and their unequal distribution in vulnerable students ( Chatterji and Li , 2021 ; Engzell et al . , 2020 ; Maldonado and De Witte , 2020 ; Unicef , 2021a ) . Alban Conto et al . ( 2021 ) find that remote learning is especially inadequate for the most vulnerable and youngest students . In that sense , Hossain ( 2021 ) suggests that the most vulnerable students are less likely to access distance education services . Therefore , learning costs and inequality gaps are expected to have a greater impact among the most vulnerable children and adolescents . In Latin America , through simulations , it has been found that the pandemic widened learning gaps ( Neidh ¨ ofer et al . , 2021 ) . In this paper , we contribute to validate empirically these simulations by estimating the change in learning inequality in Colombia based on observed educational outcomes . In the second section of this paper , we present the evolution of so - cioeconomic outcomes and the education sector in Colombia during the years of the pandemic . The third section presents the data and its sources . In the fourth section , we present the quantitative methodology . The fifth section presents the results . Finally , we conclude and discuss policy recommendations to target vulnerable student ’ s learning pro - cesses to bridge learning inequality gaps . 2 . Colombian context Colombian population was deeply affected by the pandemic . First , the fall in economic activity was very pronounced since GDP felt by 7 . 3 % in 2020 . But this happened in a context where most workers do not have access to any protection since , before the pandemic , 63 . 6 % of the labor market in Colombia worked informally ( Alvarado et al . , 2021 ; Fern ´ andez and Eslava , 2022 ) . This not only implies that in the face of the pandemic many families had low insurance to protect them from the associated economic shock but also that restrictions on mobility ( due to social isolation policies ) highly affected the income of most of the Colombian households . All this reflected in higher unemployment and poverty . The national unemployment rate increased from 10 . 9 % in 2019 to 16 . 5 % in 2020 . National monetary poverty increased from 35 . 7 % in 2 According to the Observatorio de la Gesti ´ on Educativa , Santa Marta and Barrancabermeja are the cities lagging the furthest behind with 19 % and 38 % progress in reopening , respectively . Bogota and Medellin rank highest with 91 % and 98 % respectively . However , we do not have access to this data at the school level nor this information homogenized the definition of in - person classes . 3 The Territorially Focused Development Plans ( Planes de desarrollo con enfoque territorial , PDET ) were designed within the framework of the Peace Agreement . They were established to prioritize the execution of investments in municipalities historically affected by the armed conflict and with the highest poverty rates in the country . L .

Furthermore , when analyzed by area , multidimensional poverty increased in rural areas from 34 . 5 % to 37 . 1 % ( DANE , 2023 ) . Lastly , the economic shock caused by the pandemic amplified existing inequalities evidenced by the increase in the Gini Index from 50 . 5 in 2019 – 53 . 7 in 2020 ( DANE , 2022 ) . For most of these socioeconomic indicators , Colombia went back to the levels of the beginning of the XXI st century . At the same time , the education sector was one of the most affected by the pandemic since the social isolation policies implied prolonged school closures . In most of Latin - American countries school closures lasted more than 18 months ( Unicef , 2021b ) . Colombia had closures that lasted for up to 21 months . This policy decision affected more than 10 million students in the country . In 2020 most of primary and secondary students attended in - person classes until mid - March when school clo - sures were enforced . In 2021 , the National Government started a pro - gressive reopening of schools . However , there were territorial differences in the country and even until September 2021 , 18 months after the first school closures , 30 % of students remained in remote learning ( Observatorio de la Gesti ´ on Educativa , sf ) . The first pilots to reopen schools started on October 19th , but this covered very few schools and in very few territorial entities . 4 As a consequence , very few students had in - presence education in the second semester of 2020 and in the first of 2021 . Employing a nation - wide representative sample of schools , García et al . ( 2021 ) show that 62 . 3 % of secondary - level students were attending schools that did not offer any in - person education during the first semester of 2021 and only 16 % of students attended in - person lessons . The other students belong to a school that reopened during the first semester of 2021 , but they decided not to attend , or the school did not offer in person education for their level or grades . Online education in many schools was far from ideal . García et al . ( 2021 ) found that 57 % of secondary - level students had access to edu - cation platforms and 61 % to live lessons with a teacher . Furthermore , 17 % of secondary students did not have any contact with their teachers within the previous week . Moreover , there are important gaps between rural and urban schools that could explain the widening on learning inequality gaps . For example , 54 % of students in urban areas had access to education platforms , while this percentage for rural students corre - sponded to 32 % . Hence , this brief characterization of the education sector in Colombia puts forward its limitations during the pandemic and potentially explains the results of our study . Therefore , the combination of the educational crisis explained by restrictive policies and the socioeconomic downturn in the Colombian context could explain a widening in inequality learning gaps . On the one hand , the socioeconomic crisis accompanied by higher unemployment and higher poverty , among others , affected the economically vulnerable students . Not only the usual link - a reduction in the opportunities to learn because of a lack of economic resources - between poverty and academic success is in play here . Poverty also reduces cognitive capacity Table 3 Learning inequality variation during Covid - 19 by SES status .

On September 1st , 2020 , the Government began a reopening pilot of some economic sectors . The education sector , including schools , remained excluded . It was until October 19th , 2020 , that a pilot for reopening schools began . Nonetheless , the reach of this pilot was limited even in Bogota , Colombia ’ s capital , where only 15 % of public schools participated . This process resulted in more than 50 % of the students remaining in remote learning by the end of 2020 . L . Marín Llanes et al . International Journal of Educational Development 100 ( 2023 ) 102788 5 because poverty - related concerns consume mental resources , leaving less resources available to perform tasks and thus negatively affecting the student ’ s learning processes ( Mani et al . , 2013 ; Banerjee and Duflo , 2011 ) . Additionally , preoccupations on household ’ s income are dis - tractors for children and adolescents because scarcity changes how people allocate attention and how they look at problems and make de - cisions . Scarcity , as put by Shah et al . ( 2012 ) , demands greater focus in basic needs leading to neglect other problems such as learning perfor - mance . The consequences of the economic downturns caused by the pandemic , such as the one we aim to demonstrate in this paper , disproportionately affect vulnerable students by coping their cognitive resources and reducing their cognitive capability and attention to learn . On the other , school closures before and during the pandemic affected students ’ performance , especially for the most vulnerable groups ( Andrabi et al . , 2020 ; Angrist et al . , 2021 ; Busso and Camacho , 2020 ; Chatterji and Li , 2021 ; Engzell et al . , 2020 ; Kaffenberger , 2021 ; Mal - donado and De Witte , 2020 ; Opportunity Insights Economic Tracker , 2020 ; Thompson and Ward , 2022 ) . 3 . Data This study uses data from Saber 11 test , a Colombian standardized aptitude test designed to measure learning at the end of secondary ed - ucation . Before the pandemic it was used by most higher education in - stitutions to decide whether to accept students ’ applications . Although the test result does not establish whether or not a student obtains a high school diploma , taking the test is mandatory by law and no higher ed - ucation institution can accept a student that graduated from a Colom - bian high school that did not take the test . The Colombian Institute for the Evaluation of Education ( ICFES by its Spanish acronym ) is the entity in charge of designing and managing the test and has information on the results of educational achievement in the areas of language , mathe - matics , natural sciences , citizenship skills and English , as well as an overall score . The database with the results also provides sociodemo - graphic information of students and their households . In this article , we restrict the sample to students in the 15 – 21 age range at the time of taking the test . The database is a cross - section , repeated annually at the school level , and has 2 , 537 , 477 observations for the period 2016 – 2021 . For each student , the database has information on test results , on individual and household characteristics , on the school where the student completed high school , and on the municipality in which the student resides . Using school identifiers , we merge data from the Ministry of Education on the type of school , and enrollment in tenth and eleventh grades . The municipality data comes from different sources . This informa - tion includes the Multidimensional Poverty Index ( MPI ) , the rurality index and the distance to the capital , and a classification of Fig . 4 .

Finally , we include the variable of night luminosity measured through satellite images to have an estimate of the level of economic activity at the municipality level ( Li and Zhou , 2017 ; Li et al . , 2020 ; Sullivan III , 1989 ; Yang et al . , 2019 ) . To measure the relationship between the shock generated by the pandemic in 2020 – 2021 and educational inequality , we conduct an econometric analysis in which the outcome variable is the overall percentile on the Saber 11 test for each student . The percentile is a numerical variable that takes values between 1 and 100 and represents the relative position of an individual ’ s test score in the distribution of the cohort taking the exam in that same semester . We use this variable because it allows comparisons of results between years ; it enables us to exploit the relative position of each student ’ s performance , which is related to the inequality dimension we explore in this article . Table 1 shows descriptive statistics that allow us to characterize the students who took the test between 2016 and 2019 and those who took it in 2020 and 2021 . Although differences between students in these two periods are statistically significant , the magnitudes are small except for internet access . The proportion of students without internet access decreased from 40 . 4 % between 2016 and 2019 – to 26 . 7 % in 2020 – 2021 . The latter can be explained by the progressive availability of internet access between 2016 and 2019 , and by the challenges brought by the pandemic that forced households to obtain internet connectivity services . 6 Moreover , the government implemented a policy to subsidize internet access for 500 , 000 households from low socio - economic levels , which may explain part of the observed increase ( MinTIC , 2021 ) . 7 There were differences in Saber11 percentiles between groups prior to 2020 and , aside from gender and PDET students , these gross differ - ences increased during the pandemic years ( 2020 – 2021 ) . Appendix 1 , Table A1 presents the change in percentile mean differences before and during Covid - 19 for each analyzed characteristic . We present this descriptive evidence to put forward the intuition that the pandemic increased pre - existing learning gaps and the magnitude of the gross differences between groups . Regarding the individual characteristics , the data shows that there is a gender gap in Saber 11 test scores . On average , males rank at a higher percentile than females . However , the inequality between men and women decreased from 4 . 6 percentiles before to Covid - 193 . 9 percentiles in 2020 – 2021 . In other words , there was a drop of 15 . 2 % . Before Covid - 19 , there was a gap in Saber11 scores of 20 . 7 percentiles between the non - ethnic population and the ethnic population . This gap increased to 21 . 1 percentiles during Covid - 19 , representing a 1 . 9 % increase . In relation to the household dimension , the mean difference in Saber 11 scores between students from high and low socioeconomic status increased from 19 . 1 pre - Covid to 19 . 9 during Covid - 19 , suggesting a 4 . 2 % increase .

( 2019 ) . 6 Despite there being a progressive increase in internet access , the change between the years prior to Covid - 19 and 2020 was significant . In 2016 , 55 . 6 % of students did not have internet access at home . This percentage was 40 . 6 % , 38 . 5 % , 36 . 4 % , and 28 . 5 % from 2017 to 2020 , respectively . 7 The program Hogares Conectados was launched in May of 2020 with the purpose of connecting to the internet 500 , 000 families at accessible costs ( MinTIC , 2021 ) . L . Marín Llanes et al . International Journal of Educational Development 100 ( 2023 ) 102788 7 students was 19 . 2 percentiles prior to Covid - 19 and increased to 21 . 2 percentiles during Covid - 19 . This change represents an increase of 10 . 4 % . Moreover , the inequality in Saber11 between urban and rural students was 15 . 2 percentiles before Covid - 19 and increased to 15 . 8 percentiles in 2020 – 2021 , representing an increase in inequality of 3 . 9 % . When analyzing the average difference in Saber11 scores between PDET and non - PDET municipalities , we find that the gap before Covid - 19 was 14 . 1 percentiles and remained unchanged in 2020 – 2021 . Hence , for all explored characteristics , except for gender and PDET , the gross gaps on learning outcomes increased during the pandemic . However , the changes presented in this section may be correlated with other determinants of inequality . Therefore , we propose an econometric strategy to analyze the inequality associated with each variable controlling for other students ’ characteristics and their social context . 4 . Methodology In all of our analyses the outcome variable is the percentile in which the student fell on the Saber 11 test in his / her cohort . The statistical analysis method enables us to determine the association between the variables of interest and Saber11 percentiles before ( 2016 – 2019 ) and during ( 2020 – 2021 ) the Covid - 19 pandemic . The variables of interest have been traditionally considered relevant in the educational process in Colombia and have been used in previous studies of educational gaps . Our approach focuses on four dimensions : individual , household , educational institution , and municipality . The Fig . A2 . 1 . Learning inequality variation by individual characteristics .

International Journal of Educational Development 100 ( 2023 ) 102788 8 individual dimension consists of gender and ethnicity . The household dimension consists of a socioeconomic categorical variable that clas - sifies each student by its corresponding household socioeconomic status ( SES ) into four different categories ( low , middle - low , middle - high and high SES ) . The categories are built according to a set of variables including assets at home ( washing machine , internet , computer , oven , tv , car , and videogames console ) and the mother ’ s education . To be consistent with the dichotomous definition of the rest of the variables of interests , we group low and middle - low SES students , and middle - high and high SES students in two categories . For the educational institu - tion level , we use the information on the school where the student finished high school including the sector ( public or private ) , and the area ( rural or urban ) . The municipality dimension considers whether or not the student resided in a municipality with historical high poverty rates and exposed to violence ( PDET ) . All these characteristics correspond to dichotomous variables ; they are equal to 1 if the student belongs to the group with higher historic educational outcomes ( men , non - ethnic , high SES , private school , urban , non - PDET ) . To estimate the effect of Covid - 19 on student learning , we would require an experimental or quasi - experimental data structure . This type of data is generally not feasible considering that the shock generated by the pandemic affected all students and , that in Colombia , there are no longitudinal data on students ’ performance . Nonetheless , through sta - tistical methods it is possible to analyze the change in students ’ relative performance conditioning to their individual and environmental characteristics . Fig .

( 2 ) and represent the percentile points change in inequality by each characteristic in comparison to 2019 . In these models we include the IPW .

International Journal of Educational Development 100 ( 2023 ) 102788 9 To analyze the learning gaps based on the observable characteristics of interest , we estimate econometric models for each interest variable . To explore the change in inequality for each variable , we estimate a model interacting the variable of interest with a Covid - 19 fixed effect . This allows us to estimate the change in educational inequality on our variable of interest associated with the pandemic years , net of the contribution of other observable and unobservable variables . The model is formally specified as follows : y i , s , t = ̃ δ 1 Z g , t | g = i , s + δ 2 μ cov id (cid:0) 19 ∗ ̃ Z g , t | g = i , s + θZ g , t | g = i , s + βX i , t + μ p + μ s + ε i , s , t ( 1 ) where y i , s , t corresponds to the percentile occupied by the student i who attended school s and took the Saber - 11 test in year t . ̃ Z g , t | g = i , s represents the specific variable of interest analyzed , which can be at the individual level ( Gender , Ethnicity , SES ) or at the school level ( Private school , Urban or PDET ) , which is why the subscript can be i or s . μ Covid (cid:0) 19 cor - responds to a Covid - 19 fixed effect taking the value of 1 from 2020 onwards . Z g , t | g = i , s captures the other variables of interest either from the individual or the school levels which are included as controls in every regression 9 . X i , t captures the values of other control variables included in the model , μ p and μ s correspond to period and school fixed effects , respectively . 8 Finally , ε i , s , t is the stochastic error of the model clustered at the school level to control for potential serial correlation among students in the same school . The two parameters of interest are δ 1 and δ 2 . The first captures the pre - pandemic inequality associated with the variable ; the second , cap - tures how that inequality changed in the pandemic years . Hence , the relative change in inequality gaps during the pandemic is measured by the ratio between δ 2 and δ 1 . Note that in all cases we control by all other variables of interest , other school level variables , and period and school fixed effects . The variables in the matrices Z g , t | g = i , s and X i , t are included as control measures for student characteristics . By controlling for these variables and introducing fixed effects , we measure the change in the net differ - ence in the outcome variable for each characteristic of Z g , t | g = i , s . The re - sults are presented in percentile points and normalized by the level of inequality prior to the pandemic captured by δ 1 . Additional to measuring the change in learning inequalities during the pandemic , this methodological approach enables us to explore the dynamic evolution of inequalities over time . Hence , by exploiting the dynamic variation , we specified the following model : y i , s , t = δ 1 ̃ Z g , t | g = i , s + ∑ 2018 y = 2016 α y ̃ Z g , t | g = i , s ∗ μ y + ∑ 2021 y = 2020 β y ̃ Z g , t | g = i , s ∗ μ y + θZ g , t | g = i , s + βX i , t + μ p + μ s + ε i , s , t ( 2 ) Where y i , s , t corresponds to the percentile occupied by the student i who attended school s and took the Saber - 11 test in year t . ̃ Z g , t | g = i , s represents the specific variable of interest analyzed , which can be at the individual level or at the school level , which is why the subscript can be i or s . Z g , t | g = i , s captures the other variables of interest either from the individual or the school levels which are included as controls in every regression . X i , t captures the values of other control variables included in the model , μ y , μ p and μ s correspond to year , period , and school fixed effects , respectively . Finally , ε i , s , t is the stochastic error of the model clustered at the school level to control for potential serial correlation among students in the same school . On the one hand , α y estimates correspond to the changes in inequality gaps for the interest variable ̃ Z g , t | g = i , s in the 2016 – 2018 period , relative to the 2019 baseline level measured by δ 1 . On the other , β y captures the dynamic evolution of learning inequality gaps during the Covid - 19 pandemic . Econometrically , it is desirable that α y estimates are statistically null or have the opposite sign of β y . Even if in this paper we do not aim to estimate causal relationships , it is desirable to find these results as they will allow us to show that the Covid - 19 pandemic changed the trend in the evolution of learning inequality for senior students in Colombia . 5 . Results In this section we present the change in learning gaps based on the results of Saber 11 test between the period before and after the pandemic hit , following the methodology developed in the previous section . Table 2 summarizes the findings for the static model and the results are presented according to the dimension to which each variable of interest belongs : individual variables , household variables , school variables , and municipality variables . 5 . 1 . Gaps by Individual Characteristics The results of the static model suggest that the gender inequality gap decreased 1 . 073 percentiles points during the 2020 – 2021 period . This estimate suggests a reduction in the gender inequality gap of 17 . 9 % . Fig . 1 presents the estimates of α y and β y vectors from Eq . ( 2 ) and sug - gests that during 2016 and 2017 the gender inequality gap remained statistically unchanged and decreased in less than 0 . 3 percentiles points during 2018 . Therefore , the yearly reduction of more than 1 percentile point in 2020 and further in 2021 represents a change in the trend of the gender inequality gap for senior students in Colombia . In other contexts , there is evidence of reductions in the gender learning gap due to larger dropout rates of the most vulnerable women ( Kwauk et al . , 2021 ) . As the purpose of this article is not to develop in - depth analysis for each of the dimensions explored , we compute gross share of women taking the Saber 11 exam before and during the pandemic by SES status at the school level . For the lowest SES status , the share of women taking the test before the pandemic was 3 . 78 % , while during the 2020 – 2021 period it was 2 . 38 % . For the mid - low and mid - high SES statuses , we identify an increasing participation of women ( 21 . 69 – 22 . 09 % , and 16 . 46 – 18 . 11 % , respectively ) . However , we also identify a decreasing share for women belonging to the higher SES category from 3 . 5 % to 2 . 81 % . Even if these statistics suggestively sup - port the hypothesis proved in other contexts , we are not able to estimate a reliable dropout measure as the denominator to compute the share of women taking the exam could be biased by specific trends in school dropout of women and vulnerable students . Therefore , we limit our analysis to this descriptive evidence , but we do not claim that the dropout mechanism completely explains our findings for the gender learning gap . In terms of the ethnicity gap , the results of the static model suggest an increase in the inequality gap of 0 . 782 percentiles points during the pandemic . This represents a 51 . 9 % increase relative to the level of inequality prior to the pandemic years . Even if the average ethnicity gap increased during Covid - 19 , the yearly estimates of the dynamic model do not point towards a statistically significant increase during 2020 and 2021 . 5 . 2 . Gaps by Household Characteristics For the household level characteristics , as mentioned in the previous section , we employ a SES index to classify students between low and high SES in the household . The results suggest an increase of 1 . 315 8 These matrices include the variables of interest ( Z g , t | g = i , s ) and other control variables ( X i , t ) . In this enumeration are all the variables of interest and control variables in the model . Individual level : gender , ethnicity , ageHousehold level : computer , internet , books in the home , television , parents ’ highest education and overcrowding . School level : sector , area , school day , nature ( academic / technical ) and educational institution . Municipality level : rurality index , dis - tance to the capital , MPI , PDET , presence of armed groups , luminosity . L . Marín Llanes et al . International Journal of Educational Development 100 ( 2023 ) 102788 10 percentiles points on the SES learning inequality gap during the pandemic period , corresponding to a 47 . 6 % increase . According to the dynamic model , Fig . 2 shows that the marginal change in inequality gap was negative or null before the pandemic , while it was positive and statistically significant during Covid - 19 . Moreover , in Table 3 we present results for the SES categorical var - iable in order to explore differences in magnitudes by level of SES status . Even if inequality gaps increased in every SES category compared to low SES students , these results suggest that the widening of the inequality gaps during the pandemic years is driven by the difference between high and low SES students . In the Table , we show that the percentile change in inequality gaps is increasing on SES status as the estimate corre - sponding to high SES students is 1 . 858 , while for mid - low and mid - high SES students the estimates correspond to 0 . 266 and 1 . 426 percentiles points , respectively . 5 . 3 . Gaps by school characteristics Moving to the results at the school level , we find the largest varia - tions in learning inequality . Our static results suggest an increase in the inequality gap of 2 . 068 percentile points between private and public schools . Before 2020 , controlling for observable measures and unob - servable time - invariant school characteristics , the gap between private and public schools was negative and unsignificant . These results suggest that the years of the Covid - 19 are associated with the surge of a private - public school ’ s inequality gap . In Fig . 3 we present the estimates from Eq . ( 2 ) and our findings suggest that , prior to the pandemic years , the dynamic evolution of the school sector inequality gap was negative and nearly statistically unsignificant . However , since 2020 we quantify a significant increase of this inequality gap that continued to grow in 2021 . In terms of the inequality gap between schools in rural and urban areas , we find an increase of 0 . 886 percentiles points during the Covid - 19 period , representing a 372 . 3 % change . Additional to a significant increase in this inequality gap , our results point to a change in the trend of this variable as presented in Fig . 3 . The dynamic model suggests null or negative estimates prior to the pandemic , that turned positive and economically significant in 2020 . In contrast to the school sector gap , the 2021 estimate for this variable is statistically equal to 0 . 5 . 4 . Gaps by municipality characteristics Analyzing inequality in Saber11 results in municipalities with high poverty rates and historically exposed to violence ( PDET ) , we find an increase in inequality learning gaps of 0 . 676 percentiles points in the Covid - 19 period . As well as for the private - public learning gap , before the pandemic , the difference between non - PDET and PDET students was negative and unsignificant . Nonetheless , the years of the pandemic are associated with the rise of an inequality learning gap at this level . In Fig . 4 , the dynamic estimation suggests null estimates for the periods prior to the pandemic and positive coefficients for the years 2020 and 2021 . Hence , these results are straightforward in showing that prior to the pandemic years , inequality learning between students in PDET and not PDET municipalities remained constant , while during the pandemic the inequality gap significantly increased . 5 . 5 . Robustness checks A potential limitation of our methodology is that the Covid - 19 pandemic could be associated with a change in the composition of co - horts . As we are not able to control for the composition of the sample nor for dropout rates , we include in Appendix 2 robustness check estima - tions with an inverse probability weighting ( IPW ) to control for the potential change in the composition of the sample during 2020 and 2021 . The results of these estimations are presented in Tables A2 . 1 and A2 . 2 , and Fig . A2 . 1 . to A2 . 4 in Appendix 2 , and our estimates of interest remain unchanged in relation to our baseline results , indicating that the potential change in the composition of the sample is not a source of bias of our findings . 6 . Conclusions One of the adverse effects of the pandemic was the educational crisis due to the socioeconomic downturn , school closures , teachers and stu - dents ’ motivation , amongst others ( Angrist et al . , 2021 ; Rodríguez - Pla - nas , 2022 ; Storey and Zhang , 2021 ) . The results presented in this paper suggest that the pandemic years are associated with the widening of Colombia ’ s pre - existent inequality gaps in learning processes of high school students . Gender was the only dimension in which there was a reduction in inequality . The econometric model suggests that the learning gaps — which considered the characteristics included in the models — increased by more than 48 % in all the other variables analyzed . Among the characteristics analyzed , school area stands out with increases in inequality of 372 % , compared to pre - existing inequality gaps . The reduction in the gender gap should be analyzed carefully because it may be related to changes in the composition of the sample . On the one hand , it is possible that the average results differentiated by gender are explained by differences in motivation , learning methods or skills between men and women ( Henderlong Corpus & Lepper , 2007 ; Mancini , 2018 ) . On the other hand , it has been found that the reduction in the achievement gap is explained by the disproportionately higher dropout rates of women in vulnerable contexts due to limitations to their mobility , child , and elder care activities , performing unpaid domestic work , and the greater likelihood of getting married ( Kwauk et al . , 2021 ) . In some countries , female school dropout during the pandemic resulted in transactional sex and teenage pregnancy ( Oulo et al . , 2021 ; Agile / - Gender P . M . A . & ICRHK , 2020 ) . In Colombia , according to data from the National Agency of Statistics ( DANE by its Spanish acronym ) , between 2020 and 2021 there was an increase of 31 . 5 % in the number of preg - nancies among women under 14 years old . Higher dropout rates among vulnerable women would have a compositional effect on test scores by not observing the test scores of those who dropped out . However , the results presented in this study are not conclusive regarding the mecha - nisms explaining the decrease in the gender gap and we do not have a reliable measure of female dropout during the pandemic years , thus its identification is beyond the scope of this paper . Further research is needed to better understand the observed change in the gender gap . One limitation of this study is that we did not control for dropout at the school level , a factor that may be correlated with average Saber 11 scores in 2020 and 2021 . This implies that the results may be under - estimated as the estimated changes in learning inequality correspond only to those students who did not drop out . However , the robustness checks with the IPW suggest that our results remain qualitatively un - changed when controlling for the probability of students taking the exam during the 2020 – 2021 period . Finally , the observed changes in inequality correspond to students who experienced the pandemic only during the last two years of high school . It is possible that the effect of the pandemic on younger students ’ learning processes is even greater and that these unevenly distributed losses accumulate over time . Given these limitations , our results are a lower bound of the change in learning inequality during the pandemic in Colombia . In the short term , the public policy implication of our results points out to the need to set up learning recovery strategies that target the most vulnerable students . These results also highlight the need for structural changes that address learning inequalities ( and low levels of learning ) that were present before the pandemic and were exacerbated after the Covid - 19 crisis . For instance , it is necessary to secure access to adequate infrastructure and highly qualified teachers to students belonging to groups where learning inequalities grew the most . Providing specific policy recommendations goes beyond the scope of this paper , however , a bottom - up approach could be implemented by L . Marín Llanes et al . International Journal of Educational Development 100 ( 2023 ) 102788 11 teachers to be responsive to the individualized needs of students from different backgrounds and with different characteristics that condition their learning processes . Thus , assuring qualified teachers among loca - tions or groups that suffered the most can be a way to address learning inequality . Qualified teachers have to acknowledge and identify how inequality exists within their classrooms to design strategies that rein - force the learning process of disadvantaged students . As suggested by the literature and evidence in recent years , struc - tural changes to education policy are difficult to materialize ( Angrist et al . , 2021 ) . However , the educational crisis and negative learning outcomes increase the urgency for concrete interventions . In Colombia , and in several contexts , there is an opportunity to align the incentives of teachers , policy makers , and other actors to implement these in - terventions . Programs that include teacher training have shown to have positive results on student learning ( Crouch , 2020 ; Angrist et al . , 2021 ) . Similarly , the infrastructure and the lessons learned from structured pedagogy programs are scalable beyond the current beneficiary schools and hold elements of the policy recommendations ( Barrera - Osorio et al . , 2018 ) . The immediate actions that we propose hereby are key to bridge educational inequality gaps due to the pandemic and its socioeconomic implications , and we consider them essential to prevent further deep - ening on inequality in the forthcoming decades .
