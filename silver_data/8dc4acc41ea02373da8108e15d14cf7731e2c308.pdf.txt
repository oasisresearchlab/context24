PHYSICAL REVIEW E 89 , 062715 ( 2014 ) Anisotropic spontaneous curvatures in lipid membranes Nikhil Walani , Jennifer Torres , and Ashutosh Agrawal * Department of Mechanical Engineering , University of Houston , Houston , Texas 77004 , USA ( Received 20 September 2013 ; revised manuscript received 7 March 2014 ; published 26 June 2014 ) Symmetry restrictions due to ﬂuidity require the strain energy in the Helfrich theory of lipid membranes to be locally isotropic in nature . Although this framework is suitable for modeling the interaction of membranes with proteins that generate spherical curvature such as clathrin , there are other important membrane - bending proteins such as BIN - amphiphysin - Rvs proteins that form a cylindrical coat with different curvatures in the longitudinal and the circumferential directions . In this work , we present a detailed mathematical treatment of the theory of lipid membranes incorporating anisotropic spontaneous curvatures . We derive the associated Euler - Lagrange equations and the edge conditions in a generalized setting that allows spatial heterogeneities in the properties of the membrane - protein system . We employ this theory to model the constriction of a membrane tubule by a cylindrical scaffold . In particular , we highlight the role of the equilibrium equation in the tangential plane in regulating the spatial variation of the surface tension ﬁeld .

INTRODUCTION Cellular membranes undergo dynamic remodeling for successful execution of various processes such as cellular transport , cell mobility , and cell division , to name a few [ 1 – 6 ] . This in general entails local bending of the membrane that could single handedly or collectively be caused by ( i ) curvature - inducing proteins or lipids , ( ii ) active force - generating cytoskeletal ﬁlaments , and ( iii ) symmetry - breaking enzymes [ 5 , 6 ] . In the existing literature on membrane mechan - ics , this bending effect has been modeled on the continuum scale by introducing a so - called spontaneous curvature ﬁeld . The application of this concept has ranged from studies modeling shapes of biological structures such as red blood cells to studies modeling processes such as cellular transport [ 1 , 3 ] . The idea of a spontaneous curvature ﬁeld is tied to the form of the strain energy function of a lipid membrane . For the Helfrich model , the strain energy depends on the local mean curvature and the Gaussian curvature of the surface [ 7 – 9 ] . This was rigorously proven on the basis of symmetry restrictions that ensure membranes offer vanishing resistance to in - plane shear deformations as they behave like two - dimensional ﬂuids [ 10 , 11 ] . For the classical Helfrich model with quadratic dependence on mean curvature and lineardependenceonGaussiancurvature , apreferredgeometry imposed by curvature - inducing proteins can be generated by prescribing a resting mean curvature and a Gaussian curvature . In general , the preferred mean curvature , called the spontaneous curvature , has been used in the literature to regulate the membrane geometry by shifting the vertex of the parabolic energy landscape ( associated with the mean curvature ) to the prescribed curvature . This approach works well for proteins that form spherical coats and induce an isotropic curvature . One excellent example of such a protein is clathrin , which plays an important role in the various vesicle - mediated transport processes in cells [ 2 , 3 ] . However , there is a different set of curvature - inducing proteins called the BIN - amphiphysin - Rvs ( BAR ) proteins that generate * Corresponding author : aagrawa4 @ central . uh . edu a cylindrical curvature instead of a spherical curvature [ 12 – 15 ] . Figure 1 shows the two types of protein scaffolds and their effect on membrane geometry . As the normal curvatures along the longitudinal axis and the circumferential direction of a cylinder are different , spontaneous curvatures generated by such proteins are anisotropic in nature . As a consequence , the standard Helfrich model is not equipped to model such membrane - protein interactions because of the inherent isotropy built into the system . To address this issue , several studies have proposed a modi - ﬁed quadratic strain energy in different contexts . A generalized energy for membranes where tilting and chirality of lipids give rise to anisotropic spontaneous curvatures was proposed in [ 16 ] . In a series of papers , the effect of anisotropic inclusions was studied via a mismatch tensor that energetically penalized the difference between the intrinsic curvatures preferred by the inclusions and the local membrane curvatures along the preferred directions [ 17 – 19 ] . For a nematic membrane made of rodlike molecules , a strain energy that incorporated sponta - neous curvatures in both the normal curvatures and the twist was proposed in [ 20 ] . Models for BAR protein attachment that account for membrane - protein electrostatic interactions and symmetry breaking by loop insertion have been reviewed in [ 21 ] . In addition to these works , computational models and an all - atom molecular dynamics model have been de - veloped to investigate the interaction of BAR proteins with the lipid membrane [ 22 – 29 ] . For an extensive list of theoretical and computational studies on membrane - protein interactions , we refer the reader to [ 30 , 31 ] . In this paper we build upon these works to present a detailed derivation of a generalized theory to model interactions of a membrane with nonspherical protein scaffolds . In particular , we derive the Euler - Lagrange equations in a fully nonlinear setting for an inhomogeneous membrane that is equipped to capture spatial variations in membrane and protein coat properties . In addition to the modiﬁed shape equation , we present the force equilibrium equation in the tangential plane in the context of anisotropic membranes . Furthermore , we derive the explicit expressions for forces and moment that act locally at any arbitrary boundary in such a membrane . The paper is organized as follows . In Sec . II we discuss the strain 1539 - 3755 / 2014 / 89 ( 6 ) / 062715 ( 8 ) 062715 - 1 ©2014 American Physical Society NIKHIL WALANI , JENNIFER TORRES , AND ASHUTOSH AGRAWAL PHYSICAL REVIEW E 89 , 062715 ( 2014 ) FIG . 1 .

In Sec . III we compute the variations and derive the Euler - Lagrange equations and the edge conditions . In Sec . IV we customize the governing equations for axisymmetric surfaces and model the interactions of a cylinder and a spherical vesicle with crescent - shaped proteins . Finally , we summarize our results in Sec . V . II . STRAIN ENERGY The lipid membrane and the protein scaffold form a nonstandard composite system . It bears similarity to ﬁber - reinforced solid materials that exhibit anisotropy generated by the directionality of the ﬁbers [ 32 ] . However , there is a fundamental difference that distinguishes the two materials . In a ﬁber - reinforced material , the ﬁbers are embedded in the matrix and as a result , the ﬁbers get convected with the matrix when subjected to a deformation . In contrast , BAR proteins are not transmembrane proteins and sit outside the outer monolayer . Thus , while the protein shell is more solidlike , the membrane inside still remains ﬂuid , allowing lipids to diffuse over the surface . Furthermore , the curvature - inducing proteins are more dynamic and can diffuse and reorient on the surface and self - assemble in different conﬁgurations depending on their spatial distribution and membrane geometry . As a result , these proteins cannot be modeled as embedded entities that get convected with a deforming membrane . This fact limits the use of symmetry arguments in a reference conﬁguration typically used to obtain restrictions on the constitutive functions of ﬁber - reinforced materials . To circumvent this problem , we impose symmetry restrictions in the current conﬁguration , similar to the approach proposed in [ 17 – 19 ] . This ensures in - corporation of directional effects from the curvature - inducing λ μ n 180 0 ( a ) ( b ) FIG . 2 . ( Color online ) Protein attachment on the membrane : ( a ) orientation of the protein in the tangential plane and ( b ) 180 ◦ rotation of the protein about the surface normal leads to an indistinguishable state . proteins without picking up unphysical effects due to protein embedding . Let ω be a two - dimensional surface with a nonuniform distribution of crescent - shaped bar proteins that tend toward anisotropic curvatures . The locus of points on ω is tracked by the position vector r ( θ μ ) , where θ μ ( μ = 1 , 2 ) are the surface coordinates . Here and henceforth , greek indices range over { 1 , 2 } and , if repeated , are summed over that range . The basis vectors on the tangential plane at any point are given by a α = r , α , where ( ) , α = ∂ ( ) / ∂θ α . This yields the metric a αβ = a α · a β and the unit surface normal vector n = a 1 × a 2 / | a 1 × a 2 | . The local curvature tensor ﬁeld is given by b = b αβ a α ⊗ a β , where b αβ = n · r , αβ = − a α · n , β ( 1 ) are the coefﬁcients of the second fundamental form , a α = a αβ a β are the contravariant basis vectors , and ( a αβ ) = ( a αβ ) − 1 is the dual metric [ 33 ] . We assume that the curvatures induced by the proteins depend on both the geometry of the proteins and their local concentrations . The orientation of a protein on the surface is given by a unit vector λ ( θ μ ) that is tangential to the one - dimensional curve that captures the in - plane protein geometry as shown in Fig . 2 ( a ) . The orientational vector λ and the surface normal n furnish a third orthonormal vector μ = n × λ , which together form a local triad { λ , μ , n } at any point on the surface . Since a membrane behaves as a ﬂuid shell offering bending resistance , the strain energy function depends on the curvature tensor b . However , unlike the classical model , for the present case we assume an additional dependence on a structural tensor M = λ ⊗ λ − μ ⊗ μ ( 2 ) to capture the anisotropic spontaneous curvatures generated from membrane - protein interactions . Such a structural tensor is routinely used to deﬁne orthotropic symmetry in two - dimensional materials [ 34 ] . In the present setting , we do not resort to a reference conﬁguration and require the model to have orthotropic symmetry in the current conﬁguration . This is motivated by the fact that a crescent - shaped protein rotated by 180 ◦ cannot be distinguished from the original protein . As a consequence , the normal spontaneous curvatures they generate are also indistinguishable [ Fig . 2 ( b ) ] . As is necessary for any material , we require the strain energy density W ( b , M ) to be Galilean invariant . This yields a list of invariants I = { tr ( b ) , tr ( M ) , det ( b ) , det ( M ) , tr ( Mb ) } . ( 3 ) 062715 - 2 ANISOTROPIC SPONTANEOUS CURVATURES IN LIPID . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW E 89 , 062715 ( 2014 ) Since the second and fourth invariants above are constant scalar ﬁelds , the irreducible basis comprises three elements H , K , and D , where H = tr ( b ) / 2 is the mean curvature , K = det ( b ) is the Gaussian curvature , and D = tr ( Mb ) / 2 is the curvature deviator . In addition to H and K present in the Helfrich model , W now is dependent on a new element D because of the directionality imposed by an orthotropic protein scaffold . To get insight into the invariants , we compute them in terms of the local principal curvatures . In the { a α , a β } and { λ , μ } bases , they can be expressed as H = 12 a αβ b αβ = ( κ λ + κ μ ) / 2 , ( 4a ) K = 12 ε αβ ε θψ b αθ b βψ = κ λ κ μ − τ 2 , ( 4b ) D = 12 b αβ ( λ α λ β − μ α μ β ) = ( κ λ − κ μ ) / 2 , ( 4c ) where κ λ = b αβ λ α λ β , κ μ = b αβ μ α μ β , τ = b αβ λ α μ β ( 5 ) are the normal curvatures along λ , μ , and the twist , respec - tively . Above , λ α and μ α are the projections of λ and μ along the tangential vectors with λ α = λ · a α , μ α = μ · a α = ( n × λ ) · a α = ε θα λ ψ a θψ , ( 6 ) where ε αβ = a − 1 / 2 e αβ , a = det ( a αβ ) , and e αβ is the permu - tation tensor with e 12 = − e 21 = 1 and zero if α = β . From Eq . ( 4c ) it is evident that D is the difference in the normal curvatures along the two orthogonal directions allowing us to prescribe a new spontaneous curvature D 0 that captures the protein - induced anisotropic curvatures . This is similar to prescribing H 0 , the spontaneous curvature associated with the mean curvature in the Helfrich model . Since { H , D } together uniquely determine { κ λ , κ μ } and vice versa [ see Eq . ( 4 ) ] , prescribing { H 0 , D 0 } is analogous to imposing preferred curvatures { κ 0 λ , κ 0 μ } in the two directions λ and μ . In contrast , imposing a set of { H 0 , K 0 } can lead to inﬁnitely many combinations of { κ 0 λ , κ 0 μ } . Hence , the unique direction of attaching proteins cannot be deciphered in a model that depends solely on H and K . III . VARIATIONS The integration of the strain energy per unit area over the entire surface ω gives the total strain energy ˜ E = (cid:2) ω W ( H , D , K ; θ α ) . ( 7 ) An explicit dependence on surface coordinates allows mod - eling of heterogeneous membranes with spatially varying properties [ 35 ] . To impose the area and the volume constraints , we obtain an augmented potential energy functional E = (cid:2) ω [ W ( H , D , K ; θ α ) + λ ( θ α ) ] da − pV ( ω ) , ( 8 ) where λ ( θ α ) is the surface tension ﬁeld and p is the trans - membrane pressure [ 36 ] . We allow tension to vary spatially in order to prevent local areal dilation . This assumption is based on the observation that a bilayer can only endure a maximum of 2 % – 3 % stretch before tearing apart [ 37 ] . We consider a family of surfaces generated by r ( θ α ; (cid:12) ) . The virtual displacement of the surface is given by u ( θ α ) = ∂∂(cid:12) r ( θ α ; (cid:12) ) | (cid:12) = 0 = ˙ r , where the superposed dot refers to the derivative with respect to the parameter (cid:12) [ 38 ] . Variation of E in Eq . ( 8 ) yields ˙ E = (cid:2) ω ˙ Wda + (cid:2) ω ( W + λ ) ( ˙ J / J ) da − p ˙ V , ( 9 ) where J = √ a / A is the ratio of the material area after deformation to that before and ˙ W = W H ˙ H + W K ˙ K + W D ˙ D . ( 10 ) The variations of the mean curvature and the Gaussian curvature were derived in [ 38 ] and are given by 2 ˙ H = a αβ ˙ b αβ − b αβ ˙ a αβ , ( 11a ) ˙ K = − Ka αβ ˙ a αβ + ˜ b αβ ˙ b αβ . ( 11b ) In this paper we focus on the variation of the curvature deviator , which , with the help of Eq . ( 4c ) , can be expressed as ˙ D = 12 ( ˙ κ λ − ˙ κ μ ) . ( 12 ) Using Eq . ( 5 ) , variations of κ λ and κ μ can be expressed as ˙ κ λ = ˙ b αβ λ α λ β + 2 b αβ ˙ λ α λ β , ˙ κ μ = ˙ b αβ μ α μ β + 2 b αβ ˙ μ α μ β . ( 13 ) From Eq . ( 6 ) and the relation a α = a αγ a γ , we can compute ˙ λ α = a αγ ( λ · ˙ a γ ) + ( λ · a γ ) ˙ a αγ , ( 14a ) ˙ μ α = ( ˙ n × λ ) · a α + ( n × λ ) · ˙ a α . ( 14b ) It is important to emphasize that in the current model λ is prescribed a priori . As a result , it is unaffected by the virtual displacements and ˙ λ = 0 . However , since μ = n × λ , ˙ μ (cid:5) = 0 because of the variations of n . Since n · n = 1 , ˙ n is perpendicular to n and lies in the tangential plane . As a result , ˙ n × λ is oriented along the normal whose projection in the tangential plane vanishes . This simpliﬁes Eq . ( 14b ) to ˙ μ α = a αγ ( μ · ˙ a γ ) + ( μ · a γ ) ˙ a αγ . ( 15 ) Substituting Eqs . ( 13 ) , ( 14a ) , and ( 15 ) in ( 12 ) , we can ﬁnally obtain ˙ D = 12 ˙ b αβ ( λ α λ β − μ α μ β ) + b αβ [ a αγ ˙ a γ · ( λ β λ − μ β μ ) + ˙ a αγ a γ · ( λ β λ − μ β μ ) ] . ( 16 ) A . Tangential variations For tangential variation u = u λ a λ , we can show ( see [ 38 ] for details ) ˙ a γ = u η ; γ a η + u λ b λγ n ( 17 ) and ˙ a αγ = − a αθ a γψ ( u θ ; ψ + u ψ ; θ ) . ( 18 ) Here and henceforth a semicolon signiﬁes the covariant deriva - tive along the tangential direction . Substitution of Eqs . ( 17 ) 062715 - 3 NIKHIL WALANI , JENNIFER TORRES , AND ASHUTOSH AGRAWAL PHYSICAL REVIEW E 89 , 062715 ( 2014 ) and ( 18 ) in ( 14a ) furnishes ˙ λ α = − λ γ a αθ a γψ ( u θ ; ψ + u ψ ; θ ) + a αθ u γ ; θ λ γ . ( 19 ) Since the metric is covariant constant , a γψ u ψ ; θ = u γ ; θ , a αθ u θ ; ψ = u α ; ψ . ( 20 ) Combining Eqs . ( 19 ) with ( 20 ) yields ˙ λ α = − λ ψ u α ; ψ . ( 21 ) Following a similar procedure , we can show ˙ μ α = − μ ψ u α ; ψ . ( 22 ) We employ Eqs . ( 13 ) , ( 21 ) , and ( 22 ) along with the Mainardi - Codazzi equations and the variation of the covariant components of the curvature tensor [ 38 ] ˙ b αβ = u η ; α b ηβ + u η ; β b ηα + u η b ηα ; β ( 23 ) to compute ˙ κ λ = u η b αβ ; η λ α λ β , ˙ κ μ = u η b αβ ; η μ α μ β . ( 24 ) Substitution of Eq . ( 24 ) in Eq . ( 12 ) ﬁnally furnishes the variation of the curvature deviator ˙ D = u η b αβ ; η ( λ α λ β − μ α μ β ) / 2 . ( 25 ) Having obtained ˙ D , we can now proceed to derive the force equilibrium equation in the tangential plane . Since ˙ V vanishes for tangential variations and ˙ J / J = u η ; η [ 38 ] , we can write Eq . ( 9 ) as ˙ E = (cid:2) ω [ ˙ W − u η ( W + λ ) ; η ] da + (cid:2) ω [ u η ( W + λ ) ] ; η da , ( 26 ) where W , η = W H H , η + W K K , η + W D D , η + ∂W / ∂θ η . ( 27 ) Making use of ˙ H = u η H , η and ˙ K = u η K , η ( derived in [ 38 ] ) together with Eqs . ( 10 ) and ( 25 ) – ( 27 ) and the Stokes theorem , we compute the Euler - Lagrange equation λ , η = − ∂W / ∂θ η − W D [ b αβ ( λ α λ β ) ; η ] . ( 28 ) The above equation allows for the computation of the surface tension ﬁeld on the surface . It generalizes the tangential equilibrium equation derived in [ 11 , 38 ] for homogeneous membranes and in [ 35 ] for membranes interacting with isotropic curvature - inducing proteins . The ﬁrst term on the right - hand side is a result of spatial heterogeneities in mem - brane properties and holds for both isotropic and anisotropic membranes . The second term is speciﬁc to anisotropic mem - branes and is governed by the functional dependence of the strain energy on D and the orientation of the proteins . If the membrane is homogeneous and isotropic , the right - hand side would vanish , furnishing a uniform surface tension over the entire surface . However , if the properties vary spatially or have a directionality , as is expected in the present context , the right - hand side can be nonzero , forcing the surface tension to evolve over the surface . B . Normal variations For normal variation u = u ( θ α ) n , we follow a similar procedure . Using Eqs . ( 14a ) and ( 15 ) and the relations ˙ a α = u , α n − ub βα a β , ˙ a αβ = − 2 ub αβ , ( 29a ) ˙ b αβ = u ; αβ − ub αγ b γβ ( 29b ) ( see [ 38 ] ) , we derive ˙ λ α = ub γψ a αψ λ γ , ˙ μ α = ub γψ a αψ μ γ . ( 30 ) Substituting Eqs . ( 29b ) and ( 30 ) in ( 13 ) , we compute the variations of the normal curvatures ˙ κ λ = (cid:3) u ; αβ + ub αγ b γβ (cid:4) λ α λ β , ˙ κ μ = (cid:3) u ; αβ + ub αγ b γβ (cid:4) μ α μ β , ( 31 ) which together with Eq . ( 12 ) yield ˙ D = (cid:5) u ; αβ + ub αγ b γβ (cid:6) ( λ α λ β − μ α μ β ) / 2 . ( 32 ) Substituting Eq . ( 32 ) , along with the relations 2 ˙ H = (cid:15)u + u ( 4 H 2 − 2 K ) , ˙ J / J = − 2 Hu , ˙ K = 2 KHu + ( ˜ b αβ u , α ) ; β ( 33 ) from [ 38 ] in Eq . ( 9 ) and employing the Stokes theorem , we compute the associated Euler - Lagrange equation 12 [ W D ( λ α λ β − μ α μ β ) ] ; βα + 12 W D ( λ α λ β − μ α μ β ) b αγ b γβ + (cid:15) (cid:5) 12 W H (cid:6) + ( W K ) ; βα ˜ b βα + W H ( 2 H 2 − K ) + 2 H ( KW K − W ) − 2 Hλ = p . ( 34 ) This is the modiﬁed shape equation in the context of anisotropic membranes . Suppressing the dependence of W on the curvature deviator D yields the original shape equation for the isotropic lipid membranes [ 11 , 35 , 36 , 38 ] . C . Edge conditions With the Euler - Lagrange equations ( 28 ) and ( 34 ) satisﬁed , the variation of the energy E for a surface ω with a boundary ∂ω reduces to ˙ E B = B t + B n , where B t = (cid:2) ∂ω ( W + λ ) u α ν α ds ( 35 ) and B n = (cid:2) ∂ω (cid:7) 12 ( W H − W D ) ν α u , α − 12 [ ( W H ) , α − ( W D ) , α ] ν α u + ( W K ˜ b αβ + W D λ α λ β ) ν β u , α − [ ( W K ) , α ˜ b αβ + ( W D λ α λ β ) ; α ] ν β u (cid:8) ds . ( 36 ) Equation ( 35 ) is the contribution from the tangential variations , which remains the same as that for the isotropic case [ 36 ] . In contrast , the contribution from the normal variations given by Eq . ( 36 ) is altered by the inclusion of the curvature deviator . We deﬁne a vector τ as the unit tangent to ∂ω as shown in Fig . 3 by taking the derivative with respect to the arc length parametrizing the boundary ∂ω , τ = d r [ θ α ( s ) ] ds . The unit normal to the boundary lying in the tangent plane to the surface can then be deﬁned by the vector ν = τ × n . Using the orthonormality of ν and τ , we can decompose the derivatives 062715 - 4 ANISOTROPIC SPONTANEOUS CURVATURES IN LIPID . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW E 89 , 062715 ( 2014 ) FIG . 3 .

( 36 ) as u , α = τ α u (cid:6) + ν α u , ν , where u (cid:6) is the derivative along τ in the direction of increasing arc length and u , ν is the normal derivative along ν [ 36 ] . We combine this with u , ν = − τ · ω − ( κ ν ν + τ τ ) · u and u = u · n to recast the edge contributions for a piecewise smooth boundary as ˙ E B = (cid:2) ∂ω ( F ν ν + F τ τ + F n n ) · u ds − (cid:2) ∂ω M τ · ω ds + (cid:9) i f i · u i , ( 37 ) where M = 12 W H + κ τ W K + W D λ α λ β ν β ν α − 12 W D , F ν = W + λ − κ ν M , F τ = − τM , F n = ( τW K ) (cid:6) − 12 ( W H ) , ν − ( W K ) , β ˜ b αβ ν α + 12 ( W D ) , ν − ( W D λ α λ β ) ; β ν α − ( W D λ α λ β ν β τ α ) (cid:6) , f i = ( W K [ τ ] + W D [ λ α λ β ν β τ α ] ) i n . ( 38 ) Square brackets indicate forward jumps in values within the brackets at the corners of the boundary , where there is a jump in τ . Above , M is the bending moment per unit length , F ν is the in - plane normal force per unit length , F τ is the in - plane shear force per unit length , F n is the transverse shear force per unit length and f i is the force applied at i th corner of ∂ω . As expected , the anisotropic contribution to the strain energy results in modiﬁed expressions for the boundary forces and moment , furnishing an extension to the edge conditions derived for isotropic membranes [ 39 – 42 ] . IV . EXAMPLE In this section we test the proposed theory by simulating the constriction of a cylindrical tubule by an exterior scaffold made of crescent - shaped proteins , such as BAR protein dimers . To this end , we customize the equations derived in the previous section for axisymmetric surfaces parametrized by meridional arc length s and azimuthal angle θ . For such a surface , r ( s , θ ) = r ( s ) e r ( θ ) + z ( s ) k , ( 39 ) where r ( s ) is the radius from axis of revolution , z ( s ) is the ele - vation from a base plane , and ( e r , e θ , k ) form the coordinate ba - sis . Since ( r (cid:6) ) 2 + ( z (cid:6) ) 2 = 1 , we can deﬁne an angle ψ such that r (cid:6) ( s ) = cos ψ , z (cid:6) ( s ) = sin ψ . ( 40 ) Above and in the rest of the section , ( ) (cid:6) = ∂ ( ) / ∂s . With θ 1 = s and θ 2 = θ , we can easily show that a 1 = r (cid:6) e r + z (cid:6) k , a 2 = r e θ , n = − sin ( ψ ) e r + cos ( ψ ) k . ( 41 ) Using Eq . ( 41 ) and its derivative , we can show that the metric ( a αβ ) = diag ( 1 , r 2 ) , the dual metric ( a αβ ) = diag ( 1 , 1 r 2 ) , and the covariant components of the curvature tensor ( b αβ ) = diag ( ψ (cid:6) , r sin ψ ) . Together they furnish the two invariants 2 H = ψ (cid:6) + sin ψ r , ( 42a ) K = H 2 − [ H − ( sin ψ ) / r ] 2 . ( 42b ) The BAR proteins align in a helical pattern on the mem - brane tubule [ 14 ] . The lateral and tip to tip interactions between the dimers help to deform the underlying membrane [ 27 ] . To achieve this efﬁciently , the BAR proteins maintain close proximity and orient themselves on the cylindrical surface with low tilt angle [ 13 ] ( tilt with respect to the longitudinal axis of the tubule ) . Thus , for our simulations , we neglect the small tilt angle and assume a continuous distribution of crescent - shaped dimers aligned in the circumferential direction . As a result , the two orientation vectors are given by λ = − e θ , μ = cos ψ e r + sin ψ k . ( 43 ) The corresponding normal curvatures in the two directions become κ λ = ( sin ψ ) / r and κ μ = ψ (cid:6) . Together , they yield the curvature deviator D = [ ( sin ψ ) / r − ψ (cid:6) ] / 2 . We consider an extension of the Helfrich energy W that is quadratic in the mean curvature H and the curvature deviator D . For the time being , we suppress the dependence of W on the Gaussian curvature K as the inﬂuence of protein coat on the Gaussian modulus is not yet known . We discuss the possible consequences of different Gaussian moduli in Sec . IV A . The generalized form of W can therefore be written as W ( H , D ; s ) = ˆ k 1 ( s ) [ H − H 0 ( s ) ] 2 + ˆ k 2 ( s ) [ D − D 0 ( s ) ] 2 + 2ˆ k 12 ( s ) [ H − H 0 ( s ) ] [ D − D 0 ( s ) ] , ( 44 ) where H 0 ( s ) and D 0 ( s ) are the preferred H and D values that arise because of the anisotropic curvatures generated by the protein scaffold . In addition to the spontaneous curvatures , we assume that the protein scaffold also alters the effective bending moduli and hence allows them to vary spatially . In the absence of the protein coat , the last two terms vanish , furnishing the standard Helfrich energy . To get some additional insight into the membrane - protein system , we can express the above energy in terms of the normal curvatures in the λ and μ directions in lieu of the mean curvature and the curvature deviator . With the help of Eqs . ( 4a ) and ( 4c ) , Eq . ( 44 ) can be written as W = k 1 ( s ) (cid:3) κ λ − κ 0 λ ( s ) (cid:4) 2 + k 2 ( s ) (cid:3) κ μ − κ 0 μ ( s ) (cid:4) 2 + 2 k 12 ( s ) (cid:3) κ λ − κ 0 λ ( s ) (cid:4)(cid:3) κ μ − κ 0 μ ( s ) (cid:4) . ( 45 ) The link between the Eqs . ( 44 ) and ( 45 ) is provided by the relations ˆ k 1 = k 1 + k 2 + 2 k 12 , ˆ k 2 = k 1 + k 2 − 2 k 12 , ˆ k 12 = ( k 1 − k 2 ) , ( 46 ) H 0 = (cid:5) κ 0 λ + κ 0 μ (cid:6)(cid:10) 2 , D 0 = (cid:5) κ 0 λ − κ 0 μ (cid:6)(cid:10) 2 . In Eq . ( 45 ) , { κ 0 λ , κ 0 μ } and { k 1 , k 2 } are the spontaneous curvatures and the bending moduli along the directions λ and μ and hence 062715 - 5 NIKHIL WALANI , JENNIFER TORRES , AND ASHUTOSH AGRAWAL PHYSICAL REVIEW E 89 , 062715 ( 2014 ) provide a more intuitive picture of the effect of the protein scaffold on the membrane in the two directions . The shape equation ( 34 ) for W ( H , D ; s ) and axisymmetric geometry reduces to p = L (cid:6) r + W H ( 2 H 2 − K ) − 2 H ( W + λ − W D D ) + ( W D ) (cid:6) cos ψ r , ( 47 ) where L / r = 12 [ ( W H ) (cid:6) − ( W D ) (cid:6) ] . ( 48 ) The equilibrium equation in the tangential plane [ Eq . ( 28 ) ] takes the form λ (cid:6) = − W (cid:6) . ( 49 ) We account for the area incompressibility of the membrane by transforming the independent variable from arc length s to area a employing the relation da / ds = 2 πr . In addition , we nondimensionalize the system of equations and deﬁne ¯ r = r / R 0 , ¯ z = z / R 0 , ¯ a = a / 2 πR 20 , ¯ κ λ = R 0 κ λ , ¯ κ μ = R 0 κ μ , ¯ H = R 0 H , ¯ D = R 0 D , ¯ λ = λR 20 (cid:10) k 0 , ¯ L = R 0 L / k 0 , ¯ k 1 = ˆ k 1 / k 0 , ¯ k 2 = ˆ k 2 / k 0 , ¯ k 12 = ˆ k 12 / k 0 , ( 50 ) where R 0 is a reference radius of curvature and k 0 is the bending modulus of the uncoated membrane . The uncoated tubule has a uniform circumferential radius ( ¯ κ λ = 0 . 5 ) with ¯ k 1 = 1 , ¯ k 2 = ¯ k 12 = 0 , and κ 0 λ = κ 0 μ = 0 . We simulate the shape evolution of the tubule for a sequence of nonuniform protein concentrations ( C 1 , C 2 , C 3 ) shown in Fig . 4 ( a ) . In a realistic setting , such a changing spatial concen - tration would correspond to a binding - driven accumulation of the protein dimers . Since in the present study we do not explicitly model the self - assembly dynamics of dimers , we prescribe the protein concentration ﬁeld a priori . We cap the concentration to a maximum value as the protein size and geometry would impose a physical restriction on the packing density . We assume that the effective membrane parameters inﬂuenced by the protein coat ( ¯ H 0 , ¯ D 0 , ¯ k 1 , ¯ k 2 ) depend linearly on the protein concentration ﬁeld [ Fig . 4 ( b ) ] . A concentration - dependent preferred curvature has indeed been experimentally observed for the BAR domain attachments [ 12 ] . We assume that the protein scaffold prefers a narrower tubule and prescribe a larger curvature ( ¯ κ 0 λ = 1 ) in the circumferential direction and zero curvature in the longitudinal direction ( ¯ κ 0 μ = 0 ) . In the ( H , D ) framework , these maximum directional curvatures transform to ¯ H 0 = 0 . 5 and ¯ D 0 = 0 . 5 . These values correspond to the maximum protein concentra - tion and get scaled by the local concentration values in the rest of the coated domain . In addition , we assume that the protein coat results in increased effective bending modulus and set ˆ k 1 = 2 and ˆ k 2 = 1 in the highest concentration region . These parameters , computed from Eq . ( 46 ) , assume a double stiffening of the membrane in the λ and μ directions . This choice of parameters is in agreement with a stiffness of 20 ± 10 k B T for the BAR proteins computed by the shape - based coarse - graining approach [ 22 ] . 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 0 0 . 5 1 C ( θ α ; t ) ¯ a t 1 t 2 t 3 ( a ) 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 C ( ) P a r a m e t e r s ¯ k 1 ¯ k 2 ¯ H 0 , ¯ D 0 ( b ) FIG . 4 . ( Color online ) ( a ) Three prescribed spatially varying protein concentration ﬁelds and ( b ) linear dependence of the various protein - induced parameters on the concentration values . For the above - mentioned parameters , we solve the differen - tial equations ( 40 ) , ( 42a ) , and ( 47 ) – ( 49 ) over an area domain varying from 0 to ¯ a 0 = 30 for vanishing transmembrane pressure subject to the boundary conditions ¯ r ( 0 ) = 2 , ¯ z ( 0 ) = 0 , ψ ( 0 ) = π / 2 , ¯ r ( ¯ a 0 ) = 2 , ψ ( ¯ a 0 ) = π / 2 , ¯ λ ( ¯ a 0 ) = 1 / 16 . ( 51 ) The last boundary condition is obtained from the solution of the standard shape equation to maintain the original cylindrical geometry far away from the protein coat domain . The computed tubule geometry and the surface tension ﬁeld are shown in Fig . 5 . As the protein coat continues to grow , the preferred circumferential and meridional curvatures are effectively imposed and the tubule attains a smaller radius in the coated domain [ Fig . 5 ( a ) ] . It is important to note that the changes in the geometry are accompanied by a concomitant change in the surface tension values shown in Fig . 5 ( b ) . The surface tension proﬁle closely follows the concentration proﬁle . From a far away normalized resting tension of 0 . 06 , the surface tension increases to 0 . 27 in the protein coat domain ( for C 3 concentration ﬁeld ) , leading to an approximate increase by 450 % . Such a drastic change in the surface tension would be speciﬁcally relevant to comprehend the role and energetics of ﬁssion proteins that form cylindrical coats . The role of the tangential equilibrium equation in capturing the spatial variation in the surface tension thus cannot be undermined . A . Effect of Gaussian modulus In the results presented so far , we had suppressed the role of Gaussian energy because of lack of experimental or 062715 - 6 ANISOTROPIC SPONTANEOUS CURVATURES IN LIPID . . .

( b ) Surface tension ﬁeld for the three geometries . numerical data on an estimate of the Gaussian modulus in the protein - coated domain . If the modulus remains unaffected by the scaffold , which appears rather non - intuitive , the equilibrium equations and the boundary conditions remain unchanged and the results presented before hold . If the modulus changes spatially , like the other bending moduli , it would affect both the geometry and the membrane stresses . To get a quantitative insight into this effect , we revisit the tubule problem with a modiﬁed strain energy ¯ W ( H , D , K ; s ) = W ( H , D ; s ) + ¯ k ( s ) [ K − K 0 ( s ) ] , where the ﬁrst term is the energy in Eq . ( 44 ) and the second term is the contribution from the Gaussian curvature . Since crescent - shaped dimers prefer a cylindrical geometry , we set K 0 ( s ) = 0 . In the uncoated domain , we set ¯ k = − k 0 based on the recent ﬁndings of Hu et al . [ 43 ] . In the protein - coated domain , we perform a parametric analysis and compute the equilibrium solution for a few different values of ¯ k . A similar approach was adopted by Das et al . to model the impact of Gaussian modulus on the geometry of a membrane with two distinct phases of lipids [ 44 ] . Since the constraint on the Gaussian modulus from the stability condition is not known for anisotropic membranes at present , we allow the modulus to span both the positive and the negative regimes . The tubule shapes and the membrane tension variations for three speciﬁc values of maximum ¯ k ( ¯ k = k 0 , − k 0 , − 3 k 0 ) corresponding to the C 3 concentration ﬁeld are shown in Fig . 6 . The changes in the overall geometry are rather subtle with minor variations occurring near the membrane - coat interface .

( b ) Surface tension ﬁeld for the three geometries . tension , however , appear more signiﬁcant , especially for the positive value of the modulus . Overall , the variations in the Gaussian modulus do not alter the qualitative response of the tubule . V . CONCLUSION We have derived the generalized theory for lipid mem - branes that interact with protein scaffolds inducing anisotropic spontaneous curvatures . In addition to the mean curvature and Gaussian curvature , the strain energy for a membrane interacting with a protein scaffold with orthotropic symmetry depends on the curvature deviator . Inclusion of this invariant alters both the equilibrium equations and the edge conditions as shown in this paper . The proposed theory is equipped to model various kinds of spatial heterogeneities that may arise because of the membrane - protein interactions . We show the efﬁcacy of the theory by modeling the squeezing of a tubule by crescent - shaped proteins . We emphasize the role of the equilibrium equation in the tangential plane by evaluating the surface tension ﬁeld on the surface and showing its nonuniform behavior . Since membrane tension is a critical component in several cellular processes and remains an enigma in experimental studies , modeling - based quantitative estimates of tension can prove to be of vital importance . We model the inﬂuence of the Gaussian modulus on the equilibrium geometry and the membrane tension . Although the inﬂuence of the protein coat on the modulus is unknown at present , a 062715 - 7 NIKHIL WALANI , JENNIFER TORRES , AND ASHUTOSH AGRAWAL PHYSICAL REVIEW E 89 , 062715 ( 2014 ) comparison of the experimental data on tubule shapes with the simulation results might provide an avenue to gain insight into the nature of the modulus . Overall , the proposed framework would be valuable in com - prehending biological phenomena where membrane - protein scaffold interactions play an important role . This bears special relevance for modeling of endocytic pathways in yeast and mammalian cells as cylindrical protein coats play a critical role in both vesicle formation and ﬁssion . Lack of an apt mathematical framework may lead to erroneous conclusions about the need and roles of different compo - nents of the endocytic machinery . In addition , the proposed framework would form the basis for formulating a dynamic model to capture the self - assembly of such proteins on a curved surface . This would be critical for understanding curvature - based protein sorting and localization in cellular membranes .
