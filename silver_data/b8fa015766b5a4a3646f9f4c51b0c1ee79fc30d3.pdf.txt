( tludwig @ primate . wisc . edu ) . We recently reported the development of TeSR1 , a serum - free , animal product – free medium that supports the derivation and long - term feeder - independent culture of human embryonic stem cells 1 . Although the derivation of new human embryonic stem cell lines in those defined conditions offered an important proof of principle , the costs of some of the defined components in that culture system made it impractical for everyday research use . Here we describe modifications to the medium ( mTeSR1 ) that include the use of animal - sourced proteins ( bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) and Matrigel ) and cloned zebrafish basic fibroblast growth factor ( zbFGF ) . We include a simple protocol that allows purification of up to 100 mg zbFGF in less than three days ( Fig . 1 ) , an amount sufficient to make 1 , 000 l of mTeSR1 medium . The modifications presented here make mTeSR1 practical for routine research use , and the protocols presented are those currently used in our laboratory for standard human embryonic stem cell culture .

Care should be taken to assure the quality of any components composed of purified nonrecombinant proteins , most notably BSA and Matrigel . BSA in particular has tremendous variability from lot to lot and must be rigorously screened before use 15 . Additionally , water quality is critical , and only reagent - grade Type 1 water should be used in the preparation of medium for cell culture . Generally , “sterile ( pharmaceutical ) water” is not manufactured to meet the specifications of reagent water , and is not an adequate substitute 16 . Long - term storage of water can also considerably affect quality , and therefore even high - quality water should not be stored for an extended period of time 17 . We routinely use a Millipore Milli - Q Ultrapure Water System ( Biocel or Synthesis systems ) to obtain water for use in medium preparation . If adequate purification systems are not available , reagent - grade Type 1 water may be purchased from several vendors including Fisher Scientific and Ricca Chemical Company ( this information is provided for information only , as we have not specifically tested water from these vendors ) . © 2006 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / www . n a t u r e . c o m / n a t u r e m e t hod s 642 | VOL . 3 NO . 8 | AUGUST 2006 | NATURE METHODS PROTOCOL 10 ml of Trace Elements B , 5 ml of Trace Elements C , 100 mg of insulin and 55 mg of holo - transferrin . Bring up to 1 l in a Class A volumetric flask . Filter - sterilize the resulting stock using a 0 . 22 - µ m PES filter . BSA must be added before other protein components . Insulin , in particular , readily adheres to glass , and substantial amounts will stick to the glassware if added before BSA . ■ PAUSE POINT Stock B can be stored at 4 ° C for a month . 35 | Prepare L - glutamine – BME stock by dissolving 146 mg L - glutamine into 10 ml of PBS . Add 7 µl of 2 - mercaptoethanol . Mix until completely dissolved . Glutamine is highly labile , and degrades upon freezing and thawing . It is important that this component stock be prepared fresh each time the medium is made and used immediately . 36 | Assemble mTeSR1 medium by mixing together the following : 800 ml DMEM / F12 200 ml Stock B ( Step 34 ) 2 ml zbFGF stock ( Step 26 ) 2 ml TGF β1 stock ( Step 27 ) 129 . 7 µl pipecolic acid working stock ( Step 29 ) 2 ml GABA stock ( Step 31 ) 2 ml LiCl stock ( Step 32 ) 2 ml chemically defined lipid concentrate 10 ml L - glutamine – BME stock ( Step 35 ) 10 ml MEM NEAA solution 560 mg NaHCO 3 if culturing at 5 % CO 2 ( 1 . 6 g NaHCO 3 if culturing at 10 % CO 2 ) Once mixed well , adjust pH to 7 . 4 using 10 N NaOH . Adjust osmolarity to between 340 and 350 mOsMol using crystalline NaCl . Filter - sterilize using a 0 . 22 - µm PES filter . ■ PAUSE POINT This medium can be stored at 4 ° C for at least 2 weeks . 37 | To prepare Matrigel - coated plates , thaw GFR Matrigel matrix overnight on ice at 4 ° C according to the manufacturer ' s recommendations . 38 | Place sterile 1 . 5 ml tubes and tips into a freezer for at least 1 h before aliquoting the Matrigel . 39 | Keeping the Matrigel on ice at all times and using chilled tips , aliquot 0 . 5 mg of Matrigel into frozen 1 . 5 - ml tubes on ice . Immediately freeze tubes at – 80 ° C . The concentration of Matrigel varies from lot to lot , so the volume of Matrigel needed to obtain 0 . 5 mg will vary accordingly . ■ PAUSE POINT The stock vials can be stored at – 80 ° C up to several months . 40 | To plate Matrigel , thaw 0 . 5 mg Matrigel ( one vial ) by diluting into 6 ml of cold DMEM / F12 ( this should take no more than a minute ) . Plate 1 ml of the resulting solution into each well of a 6 - well culture plate . Allow Matrigel to settle at room temperature for at least 1 h before use . Aspirate excess Matrigel from the plate immediately before plating cells . Plates need not be rinsed before use . ■ PAUSE POINT The plates can be wrapped with parafilm or foil and stored at 4 ° C for 1 week . Warm plates to room temperature before use . Plates should be discarded if the medium dries . 41 | To transfer human embryonic stem cells into mTeSR1 medium , replace culture medium with 2 ml / well of mTeSR1 medium 3 d before passage . 42 | Feed cells 2 ml / well mTeSR1 daily until ready to passage . mTeSR1 medium should be warmed to 37 ° C before feeding cells , and spent medium should be completely removed at each feeding . 43 | At passage , cells can be plated directly onto Matrigel - coated plates . 44 | Culture cells in a water - jacketed incubator at 37 ° C in a humidified atmosphere of either 10 % CO 2 and 5 % O 2 , or 5 % CO 2 and air .

Passaging cells cultured in mTeSR1 at the appropriate time is critical for success with this culture system . Cells will not attach properly if passaged too early and will differentiate if allowed to overgrow . There is roughly a 24 - h window to passage cells for optimal attachment and proliferation of undifferentiated cells . Cells should be split when colony centers begin to become dense , appearing brighter than the edges when viewed with a phase contrast microscope ( see Fig . 3 ) . Initially , it may be helpful to split sister wells of a single culture on successive days . Observation of these cultures in the days immediately after passage will help to identify the appropriate timing . As long as appropriate passage timing is adhered to , no adaptation time is required for cells transferred into mTeSR1 medium . 46 | When cells are ready to passage , aspirate the medium and incubate cells with 1 ml / well of prewarmed 2 mg / ml dispase ( in DMEM / F12 ) for 7 min at 37 ° C . 47 | During incubation time , prepare plates by aspirating excess Matrigel and pipetting 2 ml / well warmed mTeSR1 medium into a Matrigel - coated plate ( Steps 37 – 40 ) . 48 | When the incubation is complete , aspirate dispase solution and gently rinse cells on the plate ( centrifugation is not necessary ) a minimum of three times using 1 ml of warmed DMEM / F12 medium / well for each rinse . Adequate rinsing is critical , and reducing the number of rinses at this step will result in reduced or failed attachment . ▲ CRITICAL STEP 49 | After the third rinse , add 2 ml of mTeSR1 medium to the well and gently scrape cells from the plate while slowly expelling medium from a pipet . Plate cells directly into prepared Matrigel plates , distributing appropriately . Cells should be passaged so that roughly 3 × 10 5 cells are seeded into each fresh well . Generally , this will translate into a 1 : 3 to 1 : 6 split every 4 – 5 d . ➨ TROUBLESHOOTING ▲ CRITICAL STEP Passaging timing and technique a b c Figure 3 | Assessment of appropriate passage timing . ( a – c ) Human embryonic stem cells ( H14 passage 35 ) cultured in TeSR1 medium ready to be passaged . Note that the center of the colonies is denser , appearing brighter when viewed using a 2 × objective ( a ) . Although cells at the center of the colony appear smaller , with single nucleoli when viewed at 4 × ( b ) or 10 × ( c ) , they are actually columnar , and focusing through the center of these cells shows that the two nucleoli are stacked on top of each other . Note that the area between colonies should remain completely free of differentiated cells .

The yield of protein expression is dependent on many factors , but decreased protein yield may occur . In this case transform new BL21 Rosetta pLysS with plasmid pzbFGF ( available upon request from the Thomson laboratory ) to obtain a new expression strain . Step 49 Cells do not attach when passaged . Dispase solution may not have been completely rinsed away . Increase number and volume of rinses to assure complete removal of dispase . Cells differentiate at passage . Small isolated areas of differentiation may occasionally occur in culture . These isolated areas may be marked and removed by aspiration with a pasteur pipet . Large amounts of differentiation may result from poor - quality BSA or Matrigel . Testing different lots may improve culture . CRITICAL STEPS Step 5 It is crucial to thoroughly resuspend the cell pellet for efficient lysis . This can be achieved by vigorous pipetting or sonication . Step 9 The SDS - PAGE analysis is performed here to insure successful overproduction of zbFGF before going through the remaining protein purification procedure . A strong band at 17 kDa should appear in samples AI and S before proceeding to the next step . Step 12 The zbFGF containing fractions are expected to elute between 30 – 40 % Buffer B content , which corresponds to a NaCl concentration of 600 – 800 mM . Step 14 To decide which fractions to pool for the next purification step , be conservative to avoid unnecessary carryover of impurities . Bands obviously copurified in the next step should be avoided as much as possible . Estimate the contribution of your target protein by its staining intensity . If 50 % or more of your sample is zbFGF , you may include it in the pool . The subsequent heparin affinity purification is very powerful and eliminates the remaining impurities . Step 19 The zbFGF - containing fractions elute immediately after increasing the content of Buffer B to 100 % ( 2 M NaCl ) . Step 20 We have observed formation of zbFGF dimers as a result of oxidization . These dimers can be separated in a gradient elution between 1 and 2 M NaCl . The use of DTT as a reducing reagent sufficiently minimized dimer formation . Excessive exposure to air will increase dimer content . Step 48 Because this medium lacks serum , dispase solution must be completely rinsed from the cells before plating . If the dispase solution is not completely removed , the cells will not attach at passage . Step 49 Passage timing is critical when using mTeSR1 , more so than with any other medium we have used , and care must be taken to assure that cells are not split prematurely or allowed to overgrow . This will require flexibility on the part of the technical staff , as the cells may not conform well to a strict splitting regimen . COMMENTS FGF signaling has a central role in sustaining human ES cells 2 – 6 . We have previously shown that bFGF is less stable in serum - free medium compared to medium conditioned by fibroblasts 4 , which in part explains the use of the high concentrations of bFGF present in mTeSR1 . Heparan sulfate proteoglycans modulate the stability and activity of FGFs by forming high affinity binding complexes , but at high concentrations , FGF proteins can signal through direct interaction with FGF receptors , and the requirement for these complexes can be circumvented . In the future , the addition of appropriate heparan sulfate proteoglycans to mTeSR1 may further improve the culture of human ES cells and reduce the required bFGF concentrations . At lower concentrations of FGFs , both activin and TGF β have clear strong effects on human embryonic stem cells 7 – 9 , and based on inhibitor studies , it has been suggested that TGF β / activin signaling is essential for human embryonic stem cell self - renewal 9 , 10 . We have shown previously that the elimination of bFGF from TeSR1 has a strong impact on human embryonic stem cell culture , but the elimination of TGF β has only a modest , albeit statistically significant , impact after several passages 1 . It is important to keep in mind , however , that these growth assays were done on human © 2006 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / www . n a t u r e . c o m / n a t u r e m e t hod s NATURE METHODS | VOL . 3 NO . 8 | AUGUST 2006 | 645 PROTOCOL embryonic stem cells passaged in clumps , and that the densities of the cultures increased over time after plating . Thus , some of the components may have only modest effects under these specific conditions because the pathways could already be stimulated nearly adequately by autocrine / paracrine signaling . Clonal assays would be a more sensitive approach to determining the roles of individual growth factors , but similar to other feeder - free conditions , human embryonic stem cells now clone very poorly in TeSR1 and mTeSR1 . It is not yet clear whether the neurotropins recently reported 11 to increase the cloning efficiency of human embryonic stem cells grown on fibroblasts or conditioned medium will increase the cloning efficiency in TeSR1 , but increasing cloning efficiency remains an important area of research . We have observed no difference in the ability of human bFGF and zbFGF to sustain human embryonic stem cells , and the purification protocol provided here for zbFGF makes the use of mTeSR1 practical for routine human embryonic stem cell culture . One of the consequences of poor cloning efficiency is related to karyotypic stability of human embryonic stem cells . The literature suggests that human embryonic stem cells passaged mechanically by hand in well - defined clumps maintain a normal karyotype more consistently than those passaged enzymatically 12 . One interpretation of this apparent difference is that because human embryonic stem cells clone poorly , any passaging technique that dissociates colonies into individual cells will result in a tremendous selective pressure for abnormal cells that have an increased cloning efficiency . It is therefore very important when passaging human embryonic stem cells by enzymatic methods that clump size be carefully controlled and dissociation not be allowed to separate cells into individual cells . If care is taken , the cells can be remarkably stable in TeSR1 and mTeSR1 even with enzymatic passage . For example , we have now maintained cell line H9 in TeSR1 for 55 passages with a normal karyotype . But a new cell line we derived exclusively in TeSR1 ( WA15 ) converted from a normal karyotype to trisomy 12 sometime between 4 and 7 months of culture 1 . Taken together , these karyotype results are comparable to what we have previously observed with fibroblast coculture and enzymatic dissociation 13 . Thus , periodically monitoring the karyotypes of human embryonic stem cell cultures is prudent , regardless of culture conditions . Human embryonic stem cells cultured in TeSR1 or mTeSR1 are smaller than cells cultured on fibroblasts , and most people switching to this medium severely underestimate cell densities unless the cells are actually counted . Four to five million cells per well of a 6 - well plate is not uncommon just before splitting , and because of this increased density , cultures must be fed daily to assure adequate nutrition . This increased density ( and growth rate ) may also account for the increased importance of passage timing . If cells are split just a day too late , they can differentiate at passage and cannot be rescued . Previously when culturing human embryonic stem cells on fibroblasts or conditioned medium , we were able to passage cells once a week , maintaining a consistent split regimen , and the exact day of passage was less critical . Using TeSR1 or mTeSR1 , however , cells must be observed daily and split when the appropriate density is achieved , generally every 4 – 5 days . But regardless of these differences , new personnel in the lab with no prior culture experience have learned to culture human embryonic stem cells in this medium much more quickly than those previously learning fibroblast coculture , and we now use mTeSR1 for all routine human embryonic stem cell culture . The zbFGF purification procedure has been modified from a method previously published by Seeger and Rinas 14 . It can be scaled up by proportionally increasing the amount of wet cell weight and column volumes . The procedure for the preparation of medium is novel .
