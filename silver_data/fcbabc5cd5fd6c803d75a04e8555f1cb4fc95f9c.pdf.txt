To reach cancer cells in a tumor , a blood - borne therapeutic molecule , particle , or cell must make its way into the blood vessels of the tumor and across the vessel wall into the interstitium , which it then must migrate through . Unfortunately , tumors often develop in ways that hinder these steps . The goal of research in this area is to analyze each of these steps experimentally and theoretically and integrate the resulting information into a uniﬁed theoretical framework . This paradigm of analysis and synthesis has fostered a better understanding of physiological barriers in solid tumors and aided in the development of novel strategies to exploit and / or overcome these barriers for improved cancer detection and treatment .

For these agents to be successful , they must satisfy two requirements : ( a ) the relevant agent must be effective in the in vivo microenvi - ronment of tumors , and ( b ) this agent must reach the target cells in vivo in optimal quantities . The goal of research in this area is to examine the latter issue—the delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic agents to solid tumors and normal host tissues . All conventional and novel therapeutic agents can be divided into three cate - gories—molecules , particles , and cells . For example , in chemotherapy , the agent can be injected as a molecule or incorporated in a nano - particle or liposome . In gene therapy , it can be a molecule , a viral or nonviral particle , or a genetically engineered cell . In immunotherapy , it can be a molecule , such as an antibody , or a cell , such as activated lymphocytes . A blood - borne molecule or particle that enters the tumor vasculature reaches cancer cells via distribution through the vascular compartment , transport across the microvascular wall , and transport through the interstitial compartment . For a molecule of given size , charge , and conﬁguration , each transport process may involve diffusion and convection . In addition , during the journey the molecule may bind nonspeciﬁcally to proteins or other tissue components , bind speciﬁcally to the target ( s ) , or be metabolized ( 69 ) . Although lymphokine - activated killer cells ( lymphocytes activated by the lymphokine interleukin - 2 ) or tumor - inﬁltrat - ing lymphocytes are capable of deformation , adhesion , and migration , they encounter the same barriers that restrict their movement in tumors . Some of these physiological parameters are also important for heat transfer in normal and tumor tissues during hyperthermic treatment of cancer ( 70 ) . The overall aim of research in this area is to develop a quantitative understand - ing of each of the above - mentioned steps involved in the delivery of various agents . More speciﬁcally , the goal is to understand ( a ) how angiogenesis takes place and what determines blood ﬂow heterogeneities in tumors , ( b ) how blood ﬂow inﬂuences the metabolic microenvironment in tumors and how microenvi - ronment affects the biological properties of tumors ( e . g . vascular permeability , cell adhesion ) , ( c ) how material moves across the microvascular wall , and ( d ) how material moves through the interstitial compartment and the lymphatics . In addition , ( e ) the role of cell deformation and adhesion in the delivery of cells has been examined . Finally , ( f ) knowledge of these processes for molecules , particles , and cells has been integrated into a uniﬁed framework for scale - up from mice to men ( Figure 1 ; see color ﬁgure ) . In this article , I describe various experimental and theoretical approaches , recent ﬁndings in these six areas , and how some of these concepts have been taken from bench to bedside for potential improvement in cancer detection and treatment .

TRANSPORT IN SOLID TUMORS 243 EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL APPROACHES The following ﬁve approaches have been used to gain insight into transport phe - nomena in solid tumors . 1 . A tissue - isolated tumor connected by a single artery and a single vein to the circulation of the host ( 148 , 149 ) . This technique , originally developed in 1961 for rats ( 54 ) , has recently been adapted to mice ( 101 , 102 ) and humans ( 107 ) . 2 . A modiﬁed Sandison rabbit ear chamber ( 31 , 169 ) , a modiﬁed Algire mouse dorsal chamber ( 113 , 114 ) , and a cranial window in mice and rats ( 168 ) . Use of the ear chamber offers the advantage of superior optical quality and using the mice offers the advantage of working with immunodeﬁcient and geneti - cally engineered cells and animals ( 23 , 30 , 42 , 127 , 161 ) . A quantitative angio - genesis assay was recently developed using these transparent windows to study the physiology of vessels induced by individual growth factors ( 28 , 79 , 147 ) ( Figure 2 ; see color ﬁgure ) . In addition , single vessels of tumors have been perfused in these windows ( 115 , 116 ) , several acute preparations , e . g . liver and mesentery , have been utilized ( 44 ) , and a new model to visualize lymphatic and lymphangiogenesis in the mouse tail has been developed ( 86 , 110 ) . 3 . In vitro methods to assess the deformability , adhesion , permeability , and growth stress of normal and neoplastic cells ( 58 , 119 , 129 , 145 , 158 ) , as well as measurements of the expression of adhesion molecules in intact monolayers ( 77 , 128 ) ( Figure 3 ; see color ﬁgure ) . 4 . Various molecular biology techniques ( e . g . in situ hybridization and Southern , Northern , and Western blotting ) , including development of genetically engi - neered cells and mice ( 23 , 30 , 42 , 86 , 127 , 161 ) . Also , green ﬂuorescence protein has been used as an in vivo reporter to monitor promoter activity noninvasively ( 42 ) . 5 . Mathematical models to describe and integrate the data obtained from the above four approaches , to scale up biodistribution data from mice to men , and to design future experiments ( 6 – 9 , 11 , 12 , 37 , 74 , 82 , 83 , 132 , 133 , 135 , 140 , 163 ) . Each of these approaches has its limitations . In combination , however , they have permitted development of the framework for tumor microcirculation and drug delivery described in this article . DISTRIBUTION THROUGH VASCULAR SPACE The chaotic blood supply of tumors is the ﬁrst barrier encountered by a blood - borne agent . The tumor vasculature consists both of vessels recruited from the preexisting network of the host vasculature and of vessels resulting from the angiogenic response of host vessels to cancer cells ( 39 , 67 ) . Movement of mol - A n nu . R e v . B i o m e d . E ng . 1999 . 1 : 241 - 263 .

F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y . 244 JAIN ecules through the vasculature is governed by the vascular morphology ( i . e . the number , length , diameter , and geometric arrangement of various blood vessels ) and the blood ﬂow rate ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 49 , 108 ) . Although the tumor vasculature originates from the host vasculature and the mechanisms of angiogenesis are similar ( 39 , 108 , 139 ) , its organization may be completely different , depending on the tumor type , its growth rate , and its loca - tion . The fractal dimensions and minimum path lengths of tumor vasculature are different from those of the normal host vessels ( 2 , 3 , 48 , 49 ) . The architecture and blood ﬂow are different not only among various tumor types but also between a tumor and its metastases ( 67 , 81 ) . For example , unlike in normal tissue , where the velocity of red blood cells is dependent on vessel diameter , there is no such dependence in tumors ( 44 , 114 , 168 ) . Furthermore , the velocity of red blood cells may be an order of magnitude lower in some tumors compared with the host vessels ( Figure 4 ) . The temporal and spatial heterogeneity in tumor blood ﬂow may , in part , be a result of elevated geometric and viscous resistance in tumor vessels ( 107 , 149 , 150 , 151 ) coupling between high vascular permeability and elevated interstitial ﬂuid pressure ( 4 , 135 ) , vascular remodeling by intussuscep - tion ( 139 ) , and solid stress generated by proliferating cancer cells ( 53 , 58 ) . Based on perfusion rates , four regions can be recognized in a tumor : an avas - cular , necrotic region ; a seminecrotic region ; a stabilized microcirculation region ; and an advancing front ( 34 ) ( Figure 5 ) . Intratumor blood ﬂow distributions in spontaneous animal and human tumors are now being investigated with nuclear magnetic resonance , positron emission tomography , and functional computed tomography ( 35 , 37 , 56 , 153 ) . Although limited , these results are in concert with the transplanted tumor studies : Blood ﬂow rates in necrotic and seminecrotic regions of tumors are low , whereas those in nonnecrotic regions are variable and can be substantially higher than in surrounding ( contralateral ) host normal tissues ( 159 ) . Considering these spatial and temporal heterogeneities in blood supply coupled with variations in the vascular morphology at both microscopic and mac - roscopic levels , it is not surprising that the spatial distribution of therapeutic agents in tumors is heterogeneous and that the average uptake decreases , in gen - eral , with an increase in tumor weight . This perfusion heterogeneity also makes it difﬁcult to heat the tumor periphery during hyperthermia ( 70 ) . METABOLIC MICROENVIRONMENT The temporal and spatial heterogeneities in blood ﬂow lead to a compromised metabolic microenvironment in tumors . To quantify the spatial gradients of key metabolites , two optical techniques were recently adapted : ﬂuorescence ratio - imaging microscopy and phosphorescence quenching microscopy ( 27 , 60 , 117 , 118 , 157 ) . Both pH and p0 2 decrease with distance from tumor vessels , leading to acidic and hypoxic regions in tumors ( Figure 6 ) . Coupled with the use of cells selected for impaired glycolytic and oxidative pathways , these methods have pro - A n nu . R e v . B i o m e d . E ng . 1999 . 1 : 241 - 263 .

Although low p0 2 and pH are detrimental to some therapies ( e . g . radiation ) , they might enhance the effect of certain drugs , if the drug could be delivered in adequate quantities to those regions ( 80 , 136 , 160 ) . To gain further insight into tumor metabolism , two powerful approaches have been combined : magnetic resonance spectroscopy and tissue - isolated tumors . The former allows measurement of the energy level in tumors whereas the latter allows control of the supply of individual substrates ( e . g . glucose , oxygen ) to the tumor . A n nu . R e v .

( Top left ) Schematic of a heterogeneously perfused tumor showing well - vascularized periphery ; a seminecrotic , intermediate zone ; and an avascular , necrotic central region . Note that immediately after intravenous injection , the molecules are delivered to perfused regions only . ( Top right ) Low interstitial pressure in the periphery permits adequate extravasation of ﬂuid and macromolecules . ( Bottom ) These macromolecules move toward the center by the slow process of diffusion . In addition , interstitial ﬂuid oozing from tumor carries macromolecules with it by convection into the normal tissue . Note that the interstitial movement may be further retarded by binding . Products of metabolism may be cleared rapidly by blood . ( Adapted from Reference 68 . ) Using this approach , Eskey et al ( 36 ) recently showed that solid tumors depend more on glucose than oxygen to maintain their ATP level . Using a sandwich culture system , Helmlinger et al ( 57 ) are currently examining the relationship between the gradients of metabolites and gene expression . Two novel ﬁndings have resulted from this work on hypoxia . The relationship between hypoxia and A n nu . R e v . B i o m e d . E ng . 1999 . 1 : 241 - 263 .

Distance from the vessel wall , in microns , is shown on the x - axis , with zero being the vessel wall . ( Adapted from Reference 60 . ) vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) promoter activity in vivo is not as expected from in vitro studies . In addition , deletion of hypoxia - inducible factor 1 - a lowers angiogenesis and oxygenation in tumors . Surprisingly , instead of growing slowly , these tumors grew faster ( 23 ) . TRANSPORT ACROSS THE MICROVASCULAR WALL Once a blood - borne molecule has reached an exchange vessel , its extravasation , J s ( g / s ) , occurs by diffusion , convection and , to some extent , presumably trans - cytosis ( 65 ) . Diffusive ﬂux is proportional to the exchange vessel’s surface area , S ( cm 2 ) , and the difference between the plasma and interstitial concentrations , C p – C i ( g / ml ) . Convection is proportional to the rate of ﬂuid leakage , J f ( ml / s ) , from the vessel . J f , in turn , is proportional to S and the difference between the vascular and interstitial hydrostatic pressures , p v – p i ( mm Hg ) , minus the osmotic reﬂection coefﬁcient ( r ) times the difference between the vascular and interstitial osmotic pressures p v – p i ( mm Hg ) . The proportionality constant that relates trans - luminal diffusion ﬂux to concentration gradients , ( C p – C i ) , is referred to as the vascular permeability coefﬁcient , P ( cm / s ) , and the constant that relates ﬂuid leakage to pressure gradients is referred to as the hydraulic conductivity , L p ( cm / mm Hg { s ) . The effectiveness of the transluminal osmotic pressure difference in producing ﬂuid movement across a vessel wall is characterized by r , which is A n nu . R e v . B i o m e d .

F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y . 248 JAIN close to one for a macromolecule and close to zero for a small molecule . Thus , the transport of a molecule across normal or tumor vessels is governed by three transport parameters ( P , L p , and r ) , the surface area for exchange , and the trans - vascular concentration and pressure gradients . Vascular permeability and hydraulic conductivity of tumors in general are signiﬁcantly higher than that for various normal tissues ( 33 , 52 , 65 , 116 , 152 , 166 – 168 ) , and hence , these vessels may lack permselectivity ( 165 ) . Positively charged molecules have a higher permeability ( 29 ) . Despite increased overall permeability , not all blood vessels of a tumor are leaky ( Figure 7 ; see color ﬁgure ) . Even the leaky vessels have a ﬁnite pore size , which has been measured in a variety of human and rodent tumors ( 61 ) . The hypothesis is that the large pore size in tumors represents wide interendothelial junctions ( 61 , 143 ) . Not only does the vascular permeability vary from one tumor to the next , but within the same tumor it varies both spatially and temporally , and during tumor growth , regres - sion , and relapse ( 65 , 78 ) . The local microenvironment plays an important role in controlling vascular permeability . For example , a human glioma ( HGL21 ) is fairly leaky when grown subcutaneously in immunodeﬁcient mice , but it exhibits blood - brain barrier properties in the cranial window ( Figure 7 ) . Such site - depen - dent differences have been found with other tumors in other orthotopic sites ( 44 ) . The working hypothesis is that the host – tumor interactions control the production and secretion of cytokines associated with permeability changes [ e . g . vascular permeability factor ( VPF ) / VEGF and its inhibitors ] ( 42 , 84 ) . A better understand - ing of the molecular mechanisms of permeability regulation in tumors is likely to yield strategies for improved drug delivery ( 164 ) . If tumor vessels indeed leak ﬂuid and macromolecules , then what leads to the poor extravasation of these agents in various regions of tumors ? Experimental and human tumors exhibit high interstitial ﬂuid pressure ( 1 , 16 , 18 – 20 , 22 , 25 , 55 , 66 , 106 , 131 , 144 , 175 , 176 ) ( Table 1 ) . Furthermore , the uniformly high pressure drops precipitously to normal values in the periphery of the tumor or in the peritumor region ( 5 , 16 , 74 ) . This may lower ﬂuid extravasation in the high - pressure regions , especially because oncotic and hydrostatic pressures are also equal between the intravascular and extravascular space ( 18 , 21 , 154 ) . Because the transvascular transport of macromolecules in normal tissues occurs primarily by convection ( 65 , 142 ) , convective transport of macromolecules in the center of tumors may be less than in the tumor periphery ( 5 , 74 , 116 ) . Additionally , the average vascular surface area per unit of tissue weight decreases with tumor growth ; hence , reduced transvascular exchange would be expected in large tumors compared with small tumors ( 5 , 6 ) . TRANSPORT THROUGH INTERSTITIAL SPACE AND LYMPHATICS Once a molecule has extravasated , its movement through the interstitial space occurs by diffusion and convection ( 66 ) . Diffusion is proportional to the concen - tration gradient in the interstitium , and convection is proportional to the interstitial A n nu . R e v . B i o m e d . E ng . 1999 . 1 : 241 - 263 .

The latter , in turn , is proportional to the pressure gradient in the interstitium . Just as the interstitial diffusion coefﬁcient , D ( cm 2 / s ) , relates the diffusive ﬂux to the concentration gradient , the interstitial hydraulic conduc - tivity , K ( cm 2 / mm Hg { s ) , relates the interstitial velocity to the pressure gradient ( 66 ) . Values of these transport coefﬁcients are determined by the structure and composition of the interstitial compartment as well as by the physicochemical properties of the solute molecule ( 14 , 24 , 87 – 89 , 137 , 141 , 155 ) . Using ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching , Berk et al found D of vari - ous molecules in neoplastic tissue to be about one - third that in water ( 15 ) and to be similar to that in the host tissue ( 24 ) . Similarly , the value of K for a human colon carcinoma xenograft ( LS174T ) measured using two different methods ( 17 , 175 ) was found to be higher than that of a hepatoma ( 155 ) , which in turn was higher than that of the liver . Given these relatively high values of D and K , why are exogenously injected macromolecules not distributed uniformly in tumors ? As discussed next , there are two reasons for this apparent paradox . The time constant for a molecule with diffusion coefﬁcient D to diffuse across distance L is approximately L 2 / 4 D . For diffusion of immunoglobulin G in tumors , this time constant is 1 h for a 100 - l m distance , days for a 1 - mm distance , and months for a 1 - cm distance . Thus , for a 1 - mm tumor , diffusional transport would take days , and for a 1 - cm tumor , it would take months . If because of cellular proliferation ( 58 ) and interstitial matrix rearrangement the central vessels have collapsed completely , there would be no delivery of macromolecules by blood A n nu .

The role of binding is clearly illustrated in Figure 8 ( see color ﬁgure ) , which compares the rate of ﬂuorescence recovery of a photobleached spot in tumor tissue injected with both nonspeciﬁc and speciﬁc immunoglobulin G . In addition to the heterogeneity in D in tumors , the most unexpected result of these photobleaching studies was the large extent ( 30 % – 40 % ) of nonspeciﬁc binding ( 15 ) . As mentioned earlier , interstitial ﬂuid pressure is high in the center of tumors and low in the periphery and surrounding tissue ( 5 , 16 , 74 ) . Therefore , one would expect interstitial ﬂuid motion from the periphery of the tumor into the surround - ing normal tissue ( Figure 5 ) . In various animal and human ( xenograft ) tumors studied to date , 6 % – 14 % of plasma entering the tumor has been found to leave from the periphery of the tumor ( 65 , 68 ) . This ﬂuid leakage leads to a radially outward interstitial ﬂuid velocity of 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 l m / s at the periphery of a 1 - cm tissue - isolated tumor ( 65 ) . [ The radially outward velocity is likely to be an order of magnitude lower in a tumor grown in the subcutaneous tissue or muscle ( 5 ) . ] A macromolecule at the tumor periphery has to overcome this outward convection to diffuse into the tumor . The relative contribution of this mechanism of hetero - geneous distribution of antibodies in tumors may be smaller than the contribution of heterogeneous extravasation because of elevated pressure and necrosis ( 5 ) . In most normal tissues , extravasated macromolecules are taken up by the lym - phatics and brought back to the central circulation . Because of the lack of func - tional lymphatics within the tumor , the ﬂuid and macromolecules oozing from the tumor surface must be picked by the peritumor host lymphatics ( 7 ) . To char - acterize the transport into and within the lymphatic capillaries , Leu et al ( 110 ) recently developed a mouse tail model . Uptake and transport in this model have been measured using a macroscopic approach ( routine test dilution analysis ) and a microscopic approach ( ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ) ( 13 , 156 ) . Current efforts are directed toward uncovering mechanisms of lymphangiogenesis ( 86 ) and understanding changes in lymphatic transport in the presence of a tumor ( 109 ) , the working hypothesis being that proliferating tumor cells generate enough stress so that even if lymphatics form in tumors , they collapse . TRANSPORT OF CELLS Thus far , discussion has been limited to the parameters that govern the transport of molecules and particles ( e . g . liposomes ) in tumors . When a leukocyte enters a blood vessel , it may continue to move with ﬂowing blood , collide with the vessel wall , adhere transiently or stably , and ﬁnally extravasate . These interactions are governed by both local hydrodynamic forces and adhesive forces . The former are determined by the vessel diameter and ﬂuid velocity , and the latter by the expres - sion , strength , and kinetics of bond formation between adhesion molecules and by surface area of contact ( 125 , 130 ) . Deformability of cells affects both types A n nu . R e v . B i o m e d . E ng . 1999 . 1 : 241 - 263 .

Using intravital microscopy , Fukumura et al ( 41 ) recently showed that rolling of endogenous leukocytes is generally low in tumor vessels , whereas stable adhe - sion ( $ 30 s ) is comparable between normal and tumor vessels . On the other hand , both rolling and stable adhesion are nearly zero in angiogenic vessels induced in collagen gels by basic ﬁbroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) or VEGF / VPF , two of the most potent angiogenic factors ( 28 ) . Whether the latter is due to a low ﬂux of leukocytes into angiogenic vessels and / or down - regulation of adhesion molecules in these immature vessels is currently under investigation . The age of the animal also plays an important role in leukocyte - endothelial interactions ( 162 ) . To gain further insight into the types of cells that adhere to tumor vessels , the localization of interleukin - 2 – activated natural killer ( A - NK ) cells in normal and tumor tissues in mice was examined using positron emission tomography ( 119 , 120 ) . Immediately after systemic injection , these cells were localized primarily in the lungs , and a nondetectable number of cells arrived in the tumor ( 119 ) . These ﬁndings were consistent with previous work on the deformability of these cells using micropipet aspiration technique , in which interleukin - 2 activation was shown to make these cells rigid , and their mechanical entrapment in the lung microcirculation was predicted ( 121 , 145 ) . Constitutive expression of certain adhesion molecules in the lung vasculature also facilitates their localization in the lungs ( 76 ) . One approach to reduce lung entrapment is to reduce the rigidity of these cells ( 122 ) . Instead , to circumvent the lung , Melder et al injected A - NK cells into the blood supply of tumors and found that A - NK cells , both xenogenic and syngeneic , adhered to blood vessels in three different tumor models ( 120 , 126 , 146 ) . These results also supported the hypothesis that the endogenous cells that adhere to tumor vessels after systemic interleukin - 2 injection are mostly activated lympho - cytes ( 138 ) . To ﬁnd out which adhesion molecules are involved in the A - NK cell adhesion to tumor vessels , two in vitro approaches have been utilized . In the ﬁrst approach , the tumor vasculature was simulated in vitro , by incubating the human umbilical vein endothelial cells in the tumor interstitial ﬂuid collected using a micropore chamber ( 54 , 80 , 83 , 124 ) . Using targeted sampling ﬂuorometry , Munn et al ( 128 ) were able to quantify the expression of relevant adhesion molecules on the human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers . To determine the relative contribu - tions of these molecules in adhesion under physiological ﬂow conditions , the ﬂow chamber was utilized ( 129 ) . By using appropriate antibodies , it was found that the molecules up - regulated on the human umbilical vein endothelial cells include intracellular adhesion molecule - 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 , which bind to CD18 and very late antigen - 4 on the A - NK cells . Sporadic up - regulation of E - selectin was also observed , and the role of these molecules was conﬁrmed in vivo by treating A - NK cells with antibodies against CD18 and very late antigen - 4 prior to injecting them into the arterial supply of tumors .

F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y . 252 JAIN in vitro studies , blocking these adhesion molecules nearly eliminated the adhesion of A - NK cells to tumor vessels ( 124 ) . What leads to the up - regulation of these molecules in the tumor vasculature ? These molecules can be up - regulated by tumor necrosis factor alpha and a 90 – kDa protein ( p90 ) secreted by some neoplastic cells ( 85 , 123 , 125 ) , and they can be down - regulated by transforming growth factor beta ( 45 – 47 ) . To ﬁnd out whether other molecules are present in the tumor milieu that also induce this up - regulation , and because tumor growth and metastasis are angiogenesis dependent , the two most potent angiogenic molecules—bFGF and VEGF / VPF—were stud - ied ( 38 , 39 , 76 ) . It was found that VEGF can mimic tumor interstitial ﬂuid and up - regulate these molecules ( 30 , 147 ) . bFGF , on the other hand , exhibited no effect when used alone , but it abrogated the up - regulation induced by VEGF or tumor necrosis factor alpha ( 124 ) . These ﬁndings were in concert with earlier reports that bFGF retards the transmigration of lymphocytes across endothelial monolayer ( 95 ) and reduces adhesion of endothelial cells to collagen at low cell density ( 62 ) . They also offer a possible explanation for heterogeneous leukocyte – endothelial interactions in tumors ; bFGF might have down - regulated adhesion molecules in these tumors . Current efforts are directed toward deﬁning interac - tions between angiogenic and adhesion molecules using various in vitro and in vivo approaches , including genetically engineered mice ( 30 , 76 , 97 , 161 ) . PHARMACOKINETIC MODELING : SCALE UP FROM MOUSE TO HUMAN Thus far , the steps in the delivery of molecules and cells to and within solid tumors have been analyzed . Can this information be integrated into a uniﬁed framework ? The answer is yes , to some extent , using physiologically based phar - macokinetic modeling . This approach , pioneered by two chemical engineers in the 1960s , has been applied successfully to describe and scale up the biodistri - bution of low - molecular - weight agents ( for reviews , see 26 , 50 , 70 ) . This approach has been extended to macromolecules and cells ( 11 , 12 , 170 – 172 ) . In this approach , a mammalian body is represented by a number of physio - logical compartments interconnected anatomically . The volume and blood ﬂow rate for each of these compartments / organs are known or can be measured . The parameters that characterize transport across the subcompartments ( i . e . vascular , interstitial , and cellular ) and the metabolism of various agents are not generally known and cannot be easily measured . One philosophy has been to use as many measured parameters as possible and to estimate the remaining parameters by ﬁtting the model to the murine biodistribution data . By scaling up the parameters using well - deﬁned scale - up laws ( 26 ) , the biodistribution in human patients can be predicted and compared with clinical data . Discrepancies between predictions and actual data help in identifying interspecies differences and force the ques - A n nu . R e v . B i o m e d . E ng . 1999 . 1 : 241 - 263 .

TRANSPORT IN SOLID TUMORS 253 tioning of model assumptions . This is an evolutionary process—as understanding of underlying physiology and biochemistry improves , the relevant parameters are modiﬁed and the model is reﬁned further . The model is useful not only for design - ing murine experiments and / or clinical trials , but also for identifying sensitive parameters that need careful measurement and analysis . If detailed spatial infor - mation about a tissue / organ is needed , then a distributed parameter model for that organ , e . g . tumor , must be developed ( 6 – 9 , 11 , 12 , 63 , 64 , 82 ) . Although simple in principle , this cyclic approach of analysis and synthesis has served as a useful paradigm for developing a deeper understanding of drug and cell distribution in normal and malignant tissues . The level of sophistication of these models is likely to improve as understanding of underlying principles grows ( 2 ) . BENCH TO BEDSIDE The physiologic factors that contribute to the heterogenous delivery of therapeutic agents to tumors include heterogeneous blood supply , interstitial hypertension , relatively long transport distances in the interstitium , and cellular heterogeneities ( Figure 5 ) . How can these physiologic barriers be exploited or overcome ? Can ﬁndings about these barriers be taken from bench to bedside ? Two recently devel - oped strategies that have the potential to improve the detection and treatment of solid tumors in patients are described here . As stated earlier , all solid tumors in patients exhibit interstitial hypertension ( Table 1 ) , provided the patient has not received any anti - edema treatment ( 22 ) . Also , interstitial ﬂuid pressure rises steeply in the tumor boundary ( 16 , 74 ) . This knowledge has been used to improve the design of the needle used by radiologists to localize the tumor for surgical excision ( 75 ) . The needle placement in a tumor can be facilitated by placing a pressure - sensor in the needle . Because tumors begin to exhibit interstitial hypertension almost from the onset of angiogenesis ( 21 ) , this needle may be able to help in localizing early disease . The same concept may be useful in optimizing location and infusion pressure of needles employed in intratumor infusion of therapeutic agents ( 17 ) , and for monitoring response to therapy ( 176 ) . Several physical ( e . g . radiation , heat ) and chemical ( e . g . vasoactive drugs ) agents may lead to an increase in tumor blood ﬂow or vascular permeability ( 32 , 40 , 43 , 51 , 53 , 65 , 81 , 98 , 99 ) , or lower pH ( 80 , 160 ) . Another approach may be based on increasing the interstitial transport rate of molecules by increasing K or D enzymatically ( 17 , 68 , 155 ) or by using multistep approaches ( 9 , 10 , 12 , 163 ) . Several physical and chemical agents have been used to lower interstitial ﬂuid pressure in tumors ( 53 , 100 , 103 – 105 , 111 , 112 , 114 , 177 ) . Because microvascular and interstitial pressures in tumors are approximately equal , any change in one is followed rapidly by a similar change in the other , and thus the convective enhancement disappears rapidly ( 18 , 133 , 173 , 174 ) . By adapting a poroelastic model to solid tumors , it has been calculated theoretically and conﬁrmed exper - A n nu . R e v . B i o m e d . E ng . 1999 . 1 : 241 - 263 .

F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y . 254 JAIN imentally that the time constant of pressure transmission across the tumor vas - culature is on the order of 10 s ( 133 ) . During such a short time period , the convective enhancement is calculated to be very small ( ; 1 % ) . However , if the vascular pressure is increased repeatedly and if the transvascular transport is uni - directional or if the molecule binds avidly in the extravascular region , then , in principle , drug delivery to solid tumors can be increased signiﬁcantly ( 134 ) . In contrast , the physiologic barriers discussed here may be less of a problem for ( a ) radioimmunodetection , ( b ) treating leukemias , lymphomas , and small tumors ( e . g . micrometastases ) in which the physiological barriers are not yet fully established , ( c ) treatment of adequately perfused , low - pressure regions of large tumors for debulking , and ( d ) treatment with antibodies or other agents directed against the host cells ( e . g . tumor endothelial cells , ﬁbroblasts ) or the subendoth - elial matrix . These physiologic barriers also may pose fewer problems for treat - ment with a molecule or cell that has nearly 100 % speciﬁcity for cells in the tumor . Until such selective molecules or cells are developed , methods are urgently needed to overcome or exploit these physiologic barriers in tumors . It is hoped that an improved understanding of transport in tumors will help in developing these strategies ( 71 – 73 ) . Visit the Annual Reviews home page at http : / / www . AnnualReviews . org .

TRANSPORT IN SOLID TUMORS C - 3 Figure 3 Targeted sampling fluorometry provides quantifi - cation of adhesion molecule expression on the surface of endothelial cells in an intact monolayer . The red propidium iodide marks the cell nuclei , while the green antibody binds to adhesion molecules ( VCAM - 1 in this case ) . Using the cell nuclei as guides , the computer places appropriate regions of interest ( blue circles ) for measuring the green fluorescence of individual cells .
