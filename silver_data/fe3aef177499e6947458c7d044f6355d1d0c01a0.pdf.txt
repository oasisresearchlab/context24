ARTICLE Podosome formation promotes plasma membrane invagination and integrin - β 3 endocytosis on a viscous RGD - membrane Fakun Cao 1 , Yuhuan Zhou 1 , Xiaoting Liu 1 & Cheng - han Yu 1 ✉ Integrin receptors orchestrate cell adhesion and cytoskeletal reorganization . The endocytic mechanism of integrin - β 3 receptor at the podosome remains unclear . Using viscous RGD - membrane as the model system , here we show that the formation of podosome - like adhesion promotes Dab2 / clathrin - mediated endocytosis of integrin - β 3 . Integrin - β 3 and RGD ligand are endocytosed from the podosome and sorted into the endosomal compartment . Inhibitions of podosome formation and knockdowns of Dab2 and clathrin reduce RGD endocytosis . F - actin assembly at the podosome core exhibits protrusive contact towards the substrate and results in plasma membrane invaginations at the podosome ring . BIN1 speci ﬁ cally associates with the region of invaginated membrane and recruits DNM2 . During the podosome formation , BIN1 and DNM2 synchronously enrich at the podosome ring and trigger clathrin dissociation and RGD endocytosis . Knockdowns of BIN1 and DNM2 suppress RGD endocytosis . Thus , plasma membrane invagination caused by F - actin polymerization promotes BIN1 - dependent DNM2 recruitment and facilitate integrin - β 3 endocytosis at the podosome . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 0843 - 2 OPEN 1 School of Biomedical Sciences , Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine , University of Hong Kong , Hong Kong , China . ✉ email : chyu1 @ hku . hk COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2020 ) 3 : 117 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 0843 - 2 | www . nature . com / commsbio 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 0 ( ) : , ; S ignaling at the integrin - mediated adhesion regulates cell motility and tissue organization 1 , 2 . Through the binding of extracellular matrices , activated integrins can recruit adhe - sion adaptor proteins ( e . g . talin , FAK , and paxillin ) and assemble different types of cell – matrix adhesions , including focal adhesion , podosome , and invadopodium 3 , 4 . In particular , podosomes exhibit a short lifetime and can be found in various cell types , including macrophage , dendritic cell , smooth muscle cell , and ﬁ broblast on viscous matrices 5 , 6 . Each podosome is about 0 . 5 – 2 µm in diameter and exhibits a distinct core and ring organization 7 , 8 . The podo - some core consists of branched F - actin network polymerized by N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 9 , 10 . The podosome ring contains integrin receptors and adhesion adaptor proteins and surrounds the podosome core . Unlike contractile F - actin stress ﬁ bers attached to focal adhesions , the branched actin network of podosome core is protrusive towards the extracellular space 11 . Disassembly of integrin - mediated adhesion is an essential pro - cess to facilitate cell migration . Abnormal integrin endocytosis has been reported to promote cell migration and cancer metastasis 12 , 13 . Various endocytic pathways , such as clathrin - mediated , clathrin - independent , caveolin - dependent , phosphatidylinositol - dependent endocytosis of integrin receptors have been reported 14 , 15 . In par - ticular , Dab2 and Numb can directly bind to the NPxY motif of integrin β 3 - subunit cytoplasmic tails 16 , facilitate the assembly of clathrin coat , and promote focal adhesion disassembly 17 . Mem - brane curvature modulations by F - actin polymerization are also critical factors in receptor endocytosis . BIN / Amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) domain proteins can bind to curved membrane and pro - mote the recruitment of dynamin to the membrane ﬁ ssion site 18 , 19 . Dynamin is multidomain GTPase involved in endocytosis and remodeling of membrane organelles 20 . Upon GTP hydrolysis , dynamin oligomers collectively undergo conformational changes , resulting in the ﬁ ssion of endocytic pits and the release of endocytic vesicles . Arg - Gly - Asp ( RGD ) peptide derived from ﬁ bronectin is one of the key ligands to activate integrin - α V β 3 heterodimer and trigger adhesion formation 21 , 22 . RGD supported lipid bilayer membrane ( RGD - membrane ) has been used as a model platform to study adhesion signaling of integrin - β 3 under low traction force conditions 23 , 24 . In particular , viscous RGD - membrane can pro - mote embryonic ﬁ broblasts , which normally form contractile focal adhesions to assemble podosome - like adhesions 6 , 25 . Podosome - like adhesions of the embryonic ﬁ broblast on RGD - membrane shares similar core / ring components and lifetime as macrophage podosomes . Because of their remarkable similarity , the podosome - like adhesion on RGD - membrane is referred to the podosome . While integrin endocytosis at the focal adhesion has been well studied , how activated integrin - β 3 receptor undergoes endocytosis at the podosome remains unclear . Here , we report that membrane invagination resulted from protrusive F - actin polymerization triggers integrin - β 3 endocytosis at the podosome . Results Dab2 localizes at integrin - β 3 in the podosome ring . REF52 ﬁ broblast cells formed micron - sized RGD clusters as adhesion sites on RGD - membrane ( Fig . 1a ) . Integrin - β 3 receptors were enriched at RGD clusters and recruited cytosolic adaptor protein Dab2 ( Sup - plementary Fig . 1a – c ) . Clathrin light chain ( CLC ) was also found in Dab2 - positive integrin - β 3 clusters ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ) . As F - actin started to polymerize within the RGD – integrin - β 3 cluster and formed the podosome core , solid micron - sized adhesion transformed into a doughnut - shape podosome ring ( Supplementary Movie 1 ) . Dab2 colocalized with a subpopulation of integrin - β 3 at the podosome ring ( Fig . 1a ) . Other adhesion adaptor proteins , such as talin , were also found at the podosome ring and exhibited a mutually exclusive pattern with Dab2 ( Supplementary Fig . 1e , f ) . Integrin - β 3 and RGD ligand are internalized at the podosome . As F - actin increasingly polymerized at the podosome core , the intensities of Dab2 , integrin - β 3 , and RGD at the podosome ring gradually decreased ( Fig . 1b ) . The lost RGD puncta were subse - quently observed above the adhesion plane and internalized into the cell ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Movie 2 ) . Internalized RGD puncta colocalized with the con ﬁ rmation - speci ﬁ c antibody of activated integrin - β 3 ( Fig . 1d ) and were dynamically sorted into Rab5 , Rab7 , Rab11 , and Rab4 positive endosomes ( Fig . 1e – h and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . When Dab2 and clathrin heavy chain were individually knocked down by siRNA , podosome formation were not affected ( Supplementary Fig . 3a , b ) . However , the amount of endocytosed RGD inside the cell ( RGD endocytosis level , sum - med intensities within 2 – 20 µm above the adhesion plane ) became signi ﬁ cantly reduced ( Supplementary Fig . 3c – f ) . Inhibitions of podosome formation suppress RGD endocytosis . Src and PI3K inhibition ( PP2 10 µM and wortmannin 100 nM , respectively ) can suppress podosome formation by impeding the activation of actin nucleators 9 , 26 and resulted in the decrease of RGD endocytosis level ( Fig . 2a – f and Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Autophosphorylation of FAK at Y397 ( pY397 - FAK ) were found at both integrin - β 3 / RGD puncta in the endosomal compartment and adhesion sites on RGD - membrane ( Fig . 2g and Supple - mentary Fig . 5a , b ) . The level of pY397 - FAK in the endosomal compartment can be used as a surrogate to biochemically detect the level of RGD endocytosis . In order to exclusively detect the level of pY397 - FAK in the endosomal compartment , the con - tribution of pY397 - FAK signal from the adhesion site was quenched by detaching the cell from RGD - membrane and sus - pending in serum - free PBS for 30 min before lysis ( Fig . 2h ) . Without cell detachment , Src and PI3K inhibition did not alter the combined pY397 - FAK signal ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . However , pY397 - FAK levels in the endosomal compartment were reduced when cells were under the condition of Src and PI3K inhibition followed by detachment ( Fig . 2i , j ) . Dynamin2 ( DNM2 ) recruitment to the podosome ring triggers RGD endocytosis . DNM2 is one of the key regulators to pinch off clathrin - coated endocytic structures from the plasma membrane . Knockdown of DNM2 and overexpression of dominant negative mutant DNM2 - K44A resulted in the decrease of RGD endocy - tosis level without interfering the podosome formation ( Fig . 3 and Supplementary Fig . 6a – e ) . During the progressive F - actin poly - merization at the podosome ( phase I ) , there was a distinct increase of DNM2 recruitment to the podosome ring while CLC began to dissociate ( zone 1 in Fig . 4a and Supplementary Movie 3 ) . DNM2 reached its peak intensity before F - actin , and CLC became completely dissociated from the podosome ring ( Fig . 4b , e ) . At the same time , the intensities of RGD and integrin - β 3 at the podosome ring gradually decreased ( Fig . 4b , c , e , and Supplementary Fig . 6f ) . When F - actin started to depolymerize ( phase II ) , DNM2 remained absent , and the intensities of RGD and integrin - β 3 gradually increased . Without prominent F - actin assembly and podosome formation , the intensities of RGD , CLC and DNM2 remained relatively unchanged ( zone 2 in Fig . 4a , d ) . Protrusive F - actin polymerization causes plasma membrane deformation at the podosome ring . While the underlying sup - ported lipid membrane remained intact , the RGD intensity at the podosome core was lower than the background intensity of ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 0843 - 2 2 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2020 ) 3 : 117 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 0843 - 2 | www . nature . com / commsbio RGD - membrane ( Supplementary Fig . 7a , b ) . The local depletion of RGD implied the involvement of physical perturbations that counteracted the diffusive characteristics of supported lipid membrane . By interference re ﬂ ection microscopy ( IRM ) , the region of podosome core exhibited the lowest intensity , indi - cating the close contact and protrusive F - actin polymerization towards the supported lipid membrane ( Fig . 5a , b ) . As F - actin progressively polymerized at the podosome core , the intensity of the plasma membrane , visualized by membrane marker mCherry - KRas - CT became enriched around the F - actin ( arrow - heads in Fig . 5c and Supplementary Fig . 7c ) .

The intensity rises of the plasma membrane around the protrusive podosome core suggested membrane deformation or stacking of multiple lipid bilayer structures at the podosome ring . BIN1 is recruited to the deformed plasma membrane at the podosome ring . BIN1 , a curvature - sensing N - BAR domain protein was associated with the deformed plasma membrane around protrusive F - actin assembly and colocalized with integrin - β 3 at the podosome ring ( Fig . 5e , f , Supplementary Fig . 7d , and Supplementary Movie 4 ) . The recruitment of BIN1 was speci ﬁ c to podosome adhesions , as BIN1 was absent at non - podosome adhesions that lacked protrusive F - actin polymerization ( empty arrowhead in Fig . 5f ) . N - BAR domain of BIN1 ( aa 1 – 267 ) colo - calized with full length BIN1 at the podosome ring ( Fig . 5g ) . BIN1 without N - BAR domain ( BIN1 Δ N - BAR , aa 268 – 476 ) became cytosolic and was not enriched at the podosome ring ( Fig . 5h ) . Other SH3 - containing BAR - domain proteins , including FBP17 and syndapin2 did not distinctly enrich at the podosome ( Sup - plementary Fig . 8a , b ) . CIP4 , a F - BAR domain containing protein was found at the podosome core but did not localized at the plasma membrane enrichment around the polymerizing F - actin ( Supplementary Fig . 8c ) BIN1 recruits DNM2 to the podosome ring and promotes RGD endocytosis . During the podosome formation , BIN1 and DNM2 exhibited similar spatiotemporal recruitments around the F - actin core and colocalized at the podosome ring ( Fig . 6a , b , Supplementary Fig . 10a , and Supplementary Movie 5 ) . Like DNM2 , BIN1 also reached the peak intensity in the early phase of podosome formation before F - actin ( Fig . 6c ) . Knockdown of BIN1 caused the decrease of RGD endocytosis level without interfering podosome formation ( Fig . 6d – f and Supplementary Fig . 9a , b ) . Knockdown of CIP4 , on the other hand , did not suppress RGD endocytosis ( Supplementary Fig . 8d – e ) . It is known that C - terminal SH3 domain of BIN1 can directly interact with DNM2 ’ s PRD domain 27 ( Supplementary Fig . 9c ) . BIN1 Δ SH3 ( aa 1 – 404 ) was found at the podosome ring while DNM2 Δ PRD ( aa 1 – 742 ) was diffusive within the cell and did not enriched at the podosome ( Supplementary Fig . 9d , e ) . When BIN1 was knocked down , DNM2 recruitment to the podosome ring was signi ﬁ cantly reduced ( Fig . 6f , g and Supplementary Movie 6 ) . Overexpression of BIN1 Δ SH3 also impeded the recruitment of DNM2 to the podosome ring ( Supplementary Fig . 9d , h ) and resulted in the reduction of RGD endocytosis level ( Supplementary Fig . 9f – g ) . Discussion Podosomes are integrin - mediated adhesions , and each podosome consists of the unique ring and core organizations . On RGD - membrane , integrin - β 3 adhesion binds to RGD ligand and forms the adhesion ring of the podosome . Here , we ﬁ nd that endocytic adaptor protein Dab2 and clathrin localize at the podosome ring and subsequently dissociate as F - actin progressively polymerizes at the podosome core . Concurrently , integrin - β 3 and RGD ligand at the podosome ring gradually diminish and are internalized . Puncta of RGD ligand colocalize with activated integrin - β 3 and pY397 - FAK at the endosomal compartment and therefore are used as a surrogate to measure the endocytosis level of integrin - β 3 . While RGD puncta are found in early endosomes ( Rab5 - positive ) , late endosomes ( Rab7 - positive ) , slow - recycling endosomes ( Rab11 - positive ) , and fast - recycling endosomes ( Rab4 - positive ) , higher degrees of RGD enrichment at Rab7 and Rab4 - positive endosomes are observed . Blockages of actin nucleator activation by Src and PI3K inhibition suppress podosome formation and cause the decrease of the amount of endocytosed RGD and endosomal pY397 - FAK level .

Close association with the underlying supported bilayer substrate accounts for the physical perturbation that causes the local deple - tion of RGD intensity at the podosome core .

Knockdown of BIN1 and overexpression of BIN1 Δ SH3 mutant result in the poor recruitment of DNM2 . It appears that BIN1 serves as an upstream regulator to recruit DNM2 to the invaginated membrane at the podosome ring . Both BIN1 and DNM2 progressively enrich at the podosome ring in the early phase of podosome formation and reach the peak intensity earlier than F - actin . At the same time , the intensities of integrin - β 3 and RGD ligands start to diminish . Podosome formation and receptor - mediated endocytosis share many similar mole - cular events , including endocytic adaptor binding , membrane curvature modulation , Arp2 / 3 - mediated F - actin polymerization , and dynamin - mediated ﬁ ssion 32 , 33 . In the case of membrane receptors with soluble ligands , the assembly of clathrin triskelion is the main driving force for plasma membrane bending , and BAR domain proteins sense and stabilize the membrane curva - ture . However , as integrin - β 3 receptors are physically anchored to extracellular RGD ligands , membrane bending around ligand - bound integrin - β 3 receptors solely by the assembly of clathrin triskelion may not be energetically favorable . Protrusive F - actin polymerization is necessary to trigger plasma membrane invagi - nation and BIN1 accumulation around the podosome core . BIN1 - mediated DNM2 recruitment then triggers the ﬁ ssion of invagi - nated membrane and promotes the endocytosis of integrin - β 3 at the podosome ring ( Fig . 7 ) .

On the other hand , integrin endocytosis can promote anchorage - independent cell survival of cancer cells 35 . Viscous RGD - membrane may resemble the microenvironment of cleaved extracellular matrices by matrix metalloproteinases of invasive cancer cells 36 . Matrix - bound integrin receptors can remain in the active conformation after endocytosed and recruit FAK to the endosome . Without cell attachment to matrices , autopho - sphorylation of pY397 - FAK contributed from active integrin receptors in the endosome can continue to support ERK and PI3K signaling 37 , 38 . Likewise , integrin endocytosis and recycling play an important role in cell migration . While each podosome adhesion can turn over within 2 – 12 min 7 , protrusive character - istics of the podosome can locally promote the plasma mem - brane invagination and trigger the disassembly of podosome via integrin receptor endocytosis . In this study , we demonstrate a podosome - speci ﬁ c and membrane curvature - dependent pathway to facilitate integrin - β 3 endocytosis . It remains to be investigated whether endocytosed integrin - β 3 recycles to the plasma mem - brane to promote new adhesion formation and cell migration . Methods Preparation of RGD - membrane . 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) and 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine - N - ( cap biotinyl ) ( biotinyl - Cap - PE ) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids ( 850375C and 870273C , respectively ) . Lipids with desired compositions were mixed in chloro - form and dried by rotatory evaporation in 50 – 60 °C water bath . The lipids were then rehydrated with 2 ml Milli - Q water in 4°C fridge overnight . To make small unilamellar vesicles ( SUVs ) , the lipids suspension was probe - sonicated in an ice bath and then centrifuged at 16 , 000× g for 3h at 4°C . Supernatant solution of SUVs was collected and stored at 4°C . Glass substrate ( 25 mm in diameter , # 1 . 5 ) was prepared by bath - sonication for 30 min , and then was immersed in freshly pre - pared 50 % sulfuric acid overnight , rinsed with 50 ml Milli - Q water 10 times , and ﬁ nally dried under a nitrogen gas stream . Supported lipid membrane was self - assembled by incubating the mixture of lipid SUVs ( 99 . 8 mol % of DOPC and 0 . 2mol % of biotinyl - Cap - PE ) and an equal volume of phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) on the glass substrate in room temperature 22 . Excess lipid SUVs were removed in a Milli - Q water bath . The glass substrate with supported lipid mem - brane was assembled with an Atto ﬂ uor Cell chamber ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c A7816 ) and was always kept under the aqueous condition . Membrane detects were blocked by a 30 - min incubation of BSA in PBS buffer ( 1 mg / mL ) . 1 . 5 µg of neu - travidin ( NA , Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) with no tag ( A2666 ) , Cascade Blue ( NACB , A2663 ) , DyLight 488 ( NA488 , 22832 ) , DyLight 594 ( NA594 , 22842 ) , or DyLight 680 ( NA680 , 22848 ) was then introduced onto the supported lipid membrane for 30min and then washed away by 25ml of PBS buffer . Subsequently , 1 . 5µg of cyclo [ Arg - Gly - Asp - D - Phe - Lys ( Biotin - PEG - PEG ) ] ( RGD , PCI - 3697 - PI , Peptides Inter - national ) was introduced onto neutravidin - coated supported lipid membrane for 30min and then washed away by 25ml of PBS buffer . Before seeding cells , each chamber with RGD - membrane was rinsed with 15ml serum - free DMEM medium and kept in 37 °C . Unless otherwise stated , live cell imaging began 90min after seeding cells on RGD - membrane . Cell culture .

MEF cell was used in the membrane invagination experiment , as REF52 cell exhibited var - ious membrane ruf ﬂ ing that often resulted in high ﬂ uctuation and uneven back - ground signal of the plasma membrane . Unless otherwise stated , REF52 cells were utilized in all other experiments . Plasmid and siRNA / shRNA . Plasmid and siRNA / shRNA were transiently trans - fected via Neon electroporation system ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) . For plasmids , experiments were performed 24 – 48h after electroporation .

COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 0843 - 2 ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2020 ) 3 : 117 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 0843 - 2 | www . nature . com / commsbio 9 ( Zeiss ) was used to control image acquisition . A wide ﬁ eld epi ﬂ uorescence micro - scope ( Nikon Eclipse Ti - E ) equipped with an IRM ﬁ lter cube ( 50 / 50 beam splitter as dichroic mirror and 530 / 11nm excitation ﬁ lter ) , a high - pressure mercury lamp , and ×100 oil immersion lens ( NA = 1 . 45 ) was used to perform IRM . An environmental chamber ( 37°C and 5 % CO 2 ) was attached to the microscope body for long - term time - lapse imaging . Phenol red - free DMEM ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c 11054 - 020 ) with 20mM HEPES ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c 15630 - 080 ) was used as the imaging medium . Quanti ﬁ cation of podosome - forming cells . The cell was identi ﬁ ed as “ podosome - forming cell ” when one podosome was found . Podosome was de ﬁ ned as the RGD ring assembly and a dense F - actin core . In addition , RGD intensity at the F - actin core had to be depleted and be lower than the background intensity of RGD - membrane ( see Supplementary Fig . 7a , b ) . Quanti ﬁ cation of RGD endocytosis level . After 3 - h adherence on RGD - mem - brane , cells were treated with 4 % paraformaldehyde at 37°C for 20 min ﬁ rst and then 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 treatment at 37°C for 20 min . Under identical image acquisition parameters , ﬁ xed cells with endocytosed RGD were imaged by a spinning disc confocal microscopy with a z - step of 500 nm . Z - stack images from 2 to 20µm were summed together , and the region of interest of the entire cell ( ROI ) was de ﬁ ned by ImageJ software . Intensity within the cell in the summed image ( I total ) , camera background intensity ( I BKG ) , and area of ROI ( A ROI ) were measured accordingly . The level of RGD endocytosis was then de ﬁ ned as ( I total − I BKG ) × A ROI . The ratio of endocytosis level was calculated by Excel software and plotted by GraphPad Prism software . Bleach correction . RGD aggregates outside the cell were used as the bleached correction standard during the time - lapsed imaging acquisition . Intensities were measured by the “ Spot function ” of Imaris software ( Bitplane ) . An intensity cor - rection curve was then generated , and bleach - corrected RGD intensity was de ﬁ ned by multiplying the correction curve to the raw intensity value . For time - lapsed images , kymographs , and supplementary movies , bleach corrections of fusion proteins were performed by “ Bleach correction by simple ratio ” in ImageJ software . Images were uniformly and unbiasedly processed to enhance the contrast after bleach correction . Intensity analysis and kymograph . Intensity measurement of podosome com - ponents and drift correction were achieved by the “ Spot function ” of Imaris software ( Bitplane ) . Kymograph , ROI selection , and mean intensity measurement were performed by ImageJ software . To synchronize the event , the timepoint with the highest F - actin intensity in each dataset was set to be 400 - s , and the other channels was realigned accordingly . The ratio of intensity was calculated by dividing the intensity value with that of the ﬁ rst timepoint in each channel and was plotted by GraphPad Prism software . Recruitment level and ratiometric analysis of DNM2 . The intensity of DNM2 at the podosome ring ( I t ) , cellular background ( I C ) , and camera background ( I BKG ) were measured by ImageJ software . The intensity of DNM2 at ﬁ rst time point was de ﬁ ne as I 0 . Recruitment level of DNM2 over time was then de ﬁ ned as ( I t − I 0 ) / ( I C − I BKG ) and plotted by GraphPad Prism software . Ratiometric images were prepared by subtracting camera background and dividing cellular background in ImageJ . The identical dynamic range of ratiometric images was applied . Colocalization analysis . Colocalization analysis was achieved by Coloc function of Imaris software ( Bitplane ) . Integrin - β 3 was used as the reference channel . The amount of voxels ( V ) of integrin - β 3 and Dab2 were measured accordingly . Voxels were identi ﬁ ed at the adhesion plane only . The percentage of colocalization was de ﬁ ned by V Dab2 / V integrin - β 3 . Immuno ﬂ uorescent staining . After 3 - h adherence on RGD - membrane , cells were treated ﬁ rstly with 4 % paraformaldehyde and then 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 treatment for 20min each at 37 °C . 5 % BSA with 10 % normal donkey serum ( blocking buffer ) was used for overnight blocking at 4°C . Samples were then incubated with the primary antibody in blocking buffer at 4 °C for 48h . Primary antibody was then washed with PBS , followed by secondary antibody incubation for 2h in room temperature . Primary antibodies included activated human integrin - β 3 antibody ( 1 : 25 , anti - LIBS2 epitope clone ab62 , Millipore MABT27 ) and pFAK - Y397 ( 1 : 50 , Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c 44 - 624G ) .

Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c 89900 ) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c A32959 ) and were boiled in 4X Laemmli buffer . Lysates were separated by SDS – PAGE on 12 % gel ( Bio - Rad 161 - 0175 ) . Protein concentrations of the lysates were determined by Bradford assay ( Bio - Rad 500 - 0006 ) . Gels were transferred to PVDF membrane ( Millipore IPVH00005 ) and blocked by 5 % non - fat milk ( for non - phosphorylated targets ) or 5 % BSA ( for phosphorylated targets ) for 1 h in room temperature . PVDF membranes were then incubated with 5 % BSA con - taining primary antibody at 4 °C overnight , washed with 1X TBST , followed by secondary antibody for 1 h in room temperature . Western blots were developed by ECL ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c SG251207 ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instruction . Primary antibodies included pFAK - Y397 ( 1 : 1000 , Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c 44 - 624G ) , anti - BIN1 clone 99D ( 1 : 1500 , Millipore 05 - 449 ) , anti - DNM2 clone 27 ( 1 : 1000 , BD Biosciences 610263 ) , anti - Dab2 ( D7O9T ) ( 1 : 1000 , Cell Sig - naling Technology 12906 ) , anti - Clathrin heavy chain clone 23 ( 1 : 1000 , BD Bios - ciences 610499 ) , anti - CIP4 clone 21 ( 1 : 1000 , BD Biosciences 612557 ) , anti - tubulin alpha ( G436 ) ( 1 : 10 , 000 , Bioworld BS1699 ) , and anti - GAPDH ( 1 : 10 , 000 , Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c AM4300 ) .
