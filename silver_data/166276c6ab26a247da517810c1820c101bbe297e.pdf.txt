91 From Receivers to Givers : Understanding Practice of Reciprocity in an Online Support Community CHELSEA KIM , University of California , Davis , USA HAO - CHUAN WANG , University of California , Davis , USA In online communities , members often join as resource receivers and later transition to contributors . This study aims to examine the process of the transition through the lens of reciprocity . In the context of Gomusin Café , an online support group where women with romantic partners serving in South Korean military exchange social support , we conducted semi - structured interviews ( n = 16 ) probing how the members return the support they received to unspecified audience ( generalized reciprocity ) and to repeated interaction partners ( direct reciprocity ) . We found experiencing common hardships and forming social attachment to the community as important preceding conditions for the members to practice generalized reciprocity . The members also sought direct reciprocity despite it’s not technically and normatively supported in the platform . We discuss theoretical and practical implications of these findings .

Promoting contribution is a key to building successful online communities [ 27 ] , so understanding why people contribute to online communities has been the interest of researchers and practitioners . Many studies answered the question from the perspective of user motivation , investigating what drives users to contribute to online communities , and they identified altruism , reputation , fun , and the norm of reciprocity as some of the key motivations [ 11 , 22 ] . More recent studies of contribution in online communities suggest that members can have different roles such as readers , or lurkers , contributors , and leaders [ 1 , 43 , 57 ] . Compared to the earlier studies , these studies take a more longitudinal view on online community membership and contribution . According to these studies , throughout membership , users often transition from one role to another , usually starting as passive readers and then developing into contributors [ 43 , 57 ] . Still , even with such fluidity of roles , online communities exhibit a power - law distribution of contribution , where a small number Authors’addresses : ChelseaKim , ccckim @ ucdavis . edu , UniversityofCalifornia , Davis , OneShieldsAvenue , Davis , California , USA , 95618 ; Hao - Chuan Wang , University of California , Davis , One Shields Avenue , Davis , California , USA , 95618 .

Even though the later findings on different roles of online community members allowed a more nuanced understanding of the contributing behaviors and the sustenance of online communities , we have a limited understanding of how members transition from receivers to contributors . In this paper , we examine the process of transition through the lens of reciprocity . According to this perspective , one’s contributing behaviors depend on the previous experience of receiving resources from others . This perspective is compared to the motivational perspective on contribution , which views community members as independent actors who are driven by internal motivation such as fun and reputation . Some studies [ 25 , 31 , 33 ] have examined the practice of reciprocity in the context of exchanging physical goods . For example , Lampinen et al . [ 31 ] found that members of a local online exchange group felt urge to contribute because they feel sense of indebtedness from what they received before . In their network analyses , Kizilcec et al . [ 25 ] observed the pattern of reciprocity in online gift giving where people pay gift forward after receiving . Lauterbach et al . [ 33 ] observed the pattern of reciprocity in a Couchsurfing community where people provide a place to stay to travelers . We learned from these studies that users’ contribution in communities is not only driven by individualistic motivations , but also driven by the norm of reciprocity . However , we have a limited understanding of what makes individuals more or less likely to practice reciprocity in online communities , which is a critical knowledge gap to fill for CSCW and online community design regarding the sustainability of online communities . To fill this gap , our study explores how members of an online support community practice reci - procity in exchanging informational and emotional support . We conducted in - depth interviews with 16 users of Gomusin Café , an online community of women who have their romantic partners serving in South Korean military . Gomusin Café is distinguished from other types of online communities that previous CSCW research has focused on ( e . g . , health communities , knowledge communities ) , as the interaction happening in the community is more interpersonal and less instrumental . The members experience the highest level of uncertainty and frustration during the first five to seven weeks while they lose contact with their partners who are in the training camp . After the training camp , they regain contact with their partners but still cannot see their partners freely during the remaining period of the service . Going through this period , members not only exchange information and knowledge but also exchange emotional support by sharing their everyday life . Members also engage in social interactions unrelated to military such as free - and - for - sale and DIY tips . With this unique nature , Gomusin Café allows us to study contribution in more casual and interpersonal ( vs . instrumental ) social interaction groups , which only a few previous studies have done [ 5 ] . The social and interpersonal factors driving contribution may be less salient in other contexts that are less interpersonal and more instrumental such as knowledge repository ( e . g . , Wikipedia and StackOverflow ) . In this context , we examine to what extent and through what process do members of Gomusin Café practice reciprocity . Answering these questions will help the CSCW community better understand the transition process from receivers to givers in communities . 2 RELATED WORK Two areas of research guide our perspective on contribution in online support communities : 1 ) user contribution in online support communities and 2 ) reciprocity in online communities . 2 . 1 User contribution in online support communities Much of social support happens in online communities these days [ 38 ] . People who are going through the hardships including , but not limited to , cancer , depression , single parenting , and immigration seek support from others in online communities [ 2 , 24 , 30 , 47 , 50 , 54 , 55 ] . By providing Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No . CSCW1 , Article 91 . Publication date : April 2022 . Reciprocity in Online Communities 91 : 3 informational and emotional support , online communities help members cope with the hardships [ 23 , 50 , 51 ] . Receiving social support helps individuals solve the problem and buffers distress during the hardship , positively affecting individuals’ psychological and physical well - being [ 10 , 28 ] . Conventional designs of online communities allow users easily access a large group of people who are experiencing or have experienced a common hardship . Acknowledging the importance of online communities as a source of social support , CSCW research on online support communities has explored diverse topics such as how users use technological features to support others [ 35 ] , how receiving different types of support predicts commitment to the group [ 51 ] , how individuals adopt , use , and disengage from a support community [ 36 ] , and how different groups of users exhibit different patterns of usage [ 16 ] . Like with any other types of online communities , promoting contributions from the members is a key to building successful online support communities [ 27 ] . A body of literature adopted the framework of motivation in understanding contributing behaviors , investigating what drives individuals to contribute knowledge , support , and information to online communities . For example , entertainment , expectation to get information , and the value from providing information were identified as some key motivations for contributing to a user - generated encyclopedia platform [ 29 ] . Similarly , recreation , self - advancement , and helping were the key reasons behind users’ participation in an online mathematics community [ 48 ] . Rotman et al . [ 45 ] found self - interest and the need for recognition as the motivations of the citizens participating in a citizen - science project , and Coleman and Lieberman [ 11 ] additionally revealed other motivations like reciprocity and reputation from the users in a knowledge sharing community . In the context of a Chinese depression support community , Zhang et al . [ 58 ] identified understanding depression , seeking treatment , self - expression , seeking empathy , and cultivating healthy habits as some motivations . Another body of literature examined contribution as one of many different roles that online community members can take . Using diverse typologies , studies in this body of literature have identified different roles in online communities . For example , Choi et al . [ 9 ] identified initiators , commentators , attractors , and translators as the four different user types in Reddit . Brandtzaeg and Heim [ 4 ] identified sporadics , lurkers , socializers , debaters , and actives as the five different user roles in Norwegian social networking sites . Muller et al . [ 40 ] examined lurkers , uploaders , and contributors in a file - sharing service . These roles are not fixed , and members may change their roles organically . According to the Reader - to - Leader framework [ 43 ] , users transition from readers to contributors , collaborators , and then to leaders in online communities . Similarly , Rotman et al . [ 45 ] found that users’ motivation to participate in a citizen - science project changes throughout the membership . Relatedly , individuals’ experience of receiving support in the earlier days of their membership positively predicts the likelihood of staying and contributing to the community [ 37 ] . These studies suggest the importance of facilitating the role transition from receivers to contributors and using proper strategies to retain and to promote participation of users with different roles . 2 . 2 Reciprocity as a Mechanism Promoting Contribution While most of the previous studies of contribution in online communities view contribution as an outcome of individuals’ perceived external and internal rewards , some studies adopt a relational perspective on contribution . Instead of focusing on the psychological factors motivating individuals to contribute , they focus on individuals’ relationships and interactions with other community members as the factors driving contribution . For example , in a survey study , Hsieh et al . [ 22 ] found that one’s previous experience of receiving help from others predicts the likelihood of helping newcomers . Also , using behavioral log data , Pan et al . [ 42 ] predicted the number of replies one received with the number of replies one gave to others in an online health community . Adopting Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No . CSCW1 , Article 91 . Publication date : April 2022 . 91 : 4 Chelsea Kim and Hao - Chuan Wang the relational perspective can reveal the factors influencing contribution that remained hidden when adopting the motivation perspective . Also , it can provide a more nuanced understanding of the factors that are already identified . For example , how do motivations for contribution operate differently depending on one’s previous interaction with other members ? One useful framework to adopt in studying contribution from the relational perspective is reciprocity . Reciprocity is a fundamental principle guiding human social behavior where one returns what they received or retrieves what they gave [ 18 ] . People exhibit the pattern of reciprocity when exchanging various things including tangible items such as money and tokens as well as expressive messages such as supportive messages [ 39 , 42 ] . On the individual level , the norm of reciprocity in exchange ensures receiving help from others in time of need [ 18 ] . Reciprocity is also crucial for individuals’ well - being , as over - benefiting is associated with the sense of indebtedness and under - benefiting with the sense of burden [ 17 , 34 ] . On the group level , reciprocity in a community promotes members’ participation and sustenance of the community [ 26 , 44 ] . Reciprocity is not a completely new concept in the research of online community . Indeed , reciprocity norm is a recurring theme in the research of motivations for contribution . This body of research found that individuals contribute to online communities guided by the belief that they have to return the help they received from other community members [ 26 , 37 , 41 ] . For example , individuals were more likely to contribute information to a community when they were prompted with the norm of reciprocity compared to when not [ 59 ] . However , the concept of reciprocity can inform us more than just on why users contribute to online communities . Instead of studying reciprocity norm as a psychological factor operating in an individual’s mind and contribution as an outcome behavior , we aim to probe the contributing behaviors as a practice of reciprocity . Studying contribution as a reciprocal behavior means viewing contribution as being contingent upon the experience of receiving . Individuals’ contribution to online communities can be in two forms of reciprocity : direct reciprocity and generalized reciprocity . Direct reciprocity is a form of reciprocity where one returns a favor to a specific person who has done a favor for them before [ 39 ] . In the context of online communities , members practice direct reciprocity by helping others who helped them before . Usually , direct reciprocity occurs when members get to know each other , build relationships , and engage in repeated interactions . Findings about the salience of direct reciprocity in online communities are inconsistent . Even though direct reciprocity is essential in maintaining close relationships and small - scale societies [ 6 , 32 ] , some suggest lack of direct reciprocity in large - scale online communities [ 52 , 53 ] . On the other hand , in their network analysis , Faraj and Johnson [ 13 ] observed that people follow the pattern of direct reciprocity when sharing knowledge in online communities . Generalized reciprocity is a form of reciprocity where one returns a favor to a different person than the one who did a favor for them before [ 39 ] . In the context of online communities , members practice generalized reciprocity when they receive help from and give help to the unspecified members . They contribute to the community by helping whoever needs help in the community , regardless of their previous interaction experience with the help seeker . Users practice generalized reciprocity in online communities when they socialize , exchange gift , and exchange knowledge [ 13 , 22 , 25 , 56 ] . Our perspective on contribution in online support communities combines the literature on members’ transition from receivers to contributors and the framework of reciprocity . According to the perspective , online community members join primarily as support receivers . Then , some of them practice reciprocity by becoming contributors , while others are stuck in the bottleneck in their transformation from receivers to contributors . We aim to draw a detailed picture of how individuals practice each of direct and generalized reciprocity by transitioning from support receivers to providers . We propose to answer to what extent and through what process members of Gomusin Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No . CSCW1 , Article 91 . Publication date : April 2022 . Reciprocity in Online Communities 91 : 5 Café practice reciprocity . In specific , we propose to examine the two types of reciprocity separately : RQ1 ) To what extent and through what process do the members return favor to non - specific individuals ( generalized reciprocity ) ? ; RQ2 ) To what extent and through what process do the members repeatedly exchange favor with specific individuals ( direct reciprocity ) ? 3 METHOD 3 . 1 Participants In South Korea , all able - bodied males aged between 19 and 35 are required to perform compulsory military service for at least 21 months . Women who have their romantic partners serving in military are called Gomusin , a Korean term for rubber shoes . Established in 2003 and now with more than 551K members , Gomusin Café is an online community where these women exchange information and emotional support while waiting for their romantic partners to be discharged . The community is hosted by Naver , the biggest web search engine in South Korea . Naver has a subsidiary service called Naver Café , a platform in the form of a bulletin board where users can form and join groups . In Gomusin Café , members can set up a username which they can use over time , and there are diverse boards discussing different topics such as romantic relationship advice and information about training camp . There are also boards for the topics that are irrelevant to military such as free - and - for - sale . One of our researchers was a member of the community in the past , so we had background knowledge of the situation that Gomusins go through and the types of interaction the members have in the community . The knowledge enabled us to contextualize the findings to the user group and to interpret the findings accordingly . Also , the fact that the researcher was once an insider made the participants more open , trusting , and willing to share their experience [ 12 ] . In addition , the characteristics of Gomusin Café where a ) members share similar hardships and b ) members exchange both informational and emotional support made the community an exemplary case of online support groups . We decided that Gomusin Café will be a proper context to study social and relational aspects of contribution , since it is distinguished from the sites that are less interpersonal and more instrumental in nature ( e . g . , Stackoverflow ) , which previous research of online communities mostly has focused on [ 11 , 48 ] . We recruited participants in two rounds . We posted a recruiting material to the group each in February of 2020 and in April of 2021 . People who were interested in being interviewed completed a short survey linked to the post , which took five minutes on average ( SD = 1 . 13 ) to complete . In the survey , they answered a few questions about demographics and community usage and provided contact information . 52 members in the first round and 16 members in the second round completed the survey . We used purposive sampling , to make sure we have participants with variety of experience regarding the length of relationship and the length of membership . We sought to study active members , so only those who reported to have posted , commented on , or read any post in the past month were contacted . We sought as many interviews as possible until we had the thematic categories related to our research questions repeating . As a result , we interviewed 16 female participants in total ; we interviewed seven in the first round in March and April of 2020 and nine in the second round in April of 2021 ( Table 1 ) . It is notable that there was one year gap between the two rounds of data collection , and the COVID - 19 pandemic arose around this time . However , there was no significant difference between the themes emerged in the two rounds of data collection , as the Korean government’s policy regarding military service was not affected by the pandemic at large . Vacations were suspended or limited during the pandemic , but the change in the vacation policy due to the pandemic had been made before the first round of the interview . Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No . CSCW1 , Article 91 . Publication date : April 2022 . 91 : 6 Chelsea Kim and Hao - Chuan Wang Table 1 .

They were all current members of the group , and the duration of their membership ranged from less than a month to three years . 3 . 1 . 1 Procedure . One of the authors conducted in - depth semi - structured interviews using a same interview outline . The interviews were from 25 to 45 minute long . All interviews were conducted on phone and recorded , and the recorded interviews were transcribed later . All information was anonymized , and the participants were associated to the interview scripts through participant codes instead of the real name ( i . e . , PX with a number in place of X ) . Since all interviews were conducted in Korean , the transcripts were translated in English by one of the researchers who is a native Korean speaker . Transcribing and coding were done on Atlas . ti Cloud . The interview was structured in three parts overall . First , we asked questions about the par - ticipants’ demographics and romantic relationships . Second , we asked questions about how the participants use the community , where participants were prompted to share their recent experiences of receiving and providing emotional and informational support . Participants were asked to walk through their psychological and behavioral process during the experiences in detail . Third , we asked whom participants exchanged support with and whether they had had previous interaction experience with the interactants . This part was intended to delve deeper into the topic of reciprocity by probing with whom individuals exchange support . Instead of using the term ‘reciprocity’ directly , we expected the insight about the theme to emerge naturally while the participants share their experience of social interaction . 3 . 1 . 2 Analysis . Our analysis adopts grounded theory , which involves constant comparison of data , iterative coding , and reflection of our stance as researchers in interpreting data [ 8 ] . Instead of starting with hypotheses or expecting to observe predetermined themes , we aimed to identify themes that emerge throughout the analysis of the interviews answering our research questions . First , we conducted an open coding of three interview scripts , which is about 18 percent of the entire data , to identify salient themes related to participants’ motivation and usage . Second , from Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No . CSCW1 , Article 91 . Publication date : April 2022 . Reciprocity in Online Communities 91 : 7 the themes recurring from the open coding , we selected the ones that are relevant to our research questions . For example , one of the most recurrent themes emerged in the open coding step was informativeness of the posts available in the community , but this was not selected since it’s not closely addressing our research questions through the interpretive lens of reciprocity . Third , we went over the rest of the scripts to conduct thematic analysis [ ? ] to structure the participants’ statements into broad themes around practice of reciprocity . We added and combined the themes when new themes emerged . Fourth , with the pool of the themes , we went over the script multiple times again . We grouped and consolidated the themes to reduce and focus the data . 4 RESULTS With the overarching goal to gain a deeper understanding of the practice of reciprocity , we organized the results by the themes around the two salient types of reciprocity that appear to guide individu - als’ participation in online communities : returning favor to non - specific individuals ( generalized reciprocity ) and repeating support exchange with specific members ( 4 . 2 ) . 4 . 1 How do people return favor to non - specific individuals ? 4 . 1 . 1 Join to receive information ; provide information to newcomers . Consistent to the concept of generalized reciprocity , all , except for three , participants received support in the earlier days of the membership , and then , transitioned to support providers . They initially joined the community to get information , where they either passively consumed information by searching through the existing posts or actively sought information by writing support seeking posts . After they achieved their informational need , their support seeking behaviors gradually decreased . For example , after the two - month - long training camp , soldiers are assigned to a division where they complete the rest of their service . The soldiers can use their cell phones during free time , so Gomusins can get information directly from their partners . Also , after their partners are assigned to a division , there is not much information Gomusins can get from the community , as the rules and schedule vary between different divisions . A participant shared how the information that she could receive from the community became limited after the assignment : “After my ex was assigned to a division , there was not much information I could get from the community . Among the large group of members , there were not many people whose boyfriends were assigned to the same division as mine” ( P6 ) . However , she made an important statement : “So many people usually stop logging in after the assignment . I didn’t stop” ( P6 ) . Not needing information any more did not mean quitting the community for some members . P6 stayed in the community , providing information to new members : “In the earlier days , I didn’t know anything , so I logged in to get information . Now since time has passed and I have information , I tend to log in to answer others’ questions , like how to mail letters and what the vacation policy is like” ( P6 ) . We found that this transition from support receivers to support givers is a patterned lifecycle of membership that all , except for three , of our participants experienced . The members started as primary support receivers in the earlier days , and they became helpers in the later days of their membership . If they transitioned into helpers , generalized reciprocity was completed . If they did not , they quitted the cycle at the phase of receivers . Confirming our previous understanding , the sense of shared identity coming from experiencing a common hardship emerged as a key factor driving this transition to helpers . Unlike other hardships ( e . g . , weight loss ) where experience and situations vary across individuals , some hardships , such as being a Gomusin , pregnancy , and immigration , are characterized by experiencing similar timelines of events and obstacles . For example , the length of the training camp and the restrictions on getting in touch with the romantic partners are same for all soldiers and Gomusins . The fact that they have previously experienced the hardship made the senior members feel empathy for the new Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No . CSCW1 , Article 91 . Publication date : April 2022 . 91 : 8 Chelsea Kim and Hao - Chuan Wang members . One participant shared : “I really want to help them , especially beginning Gomusins . I feel sense of belonging as another Gomusin . That’s why I comment actively to the advice seeking posts” ( P2 ) . When probed on why she feels this way toward the newcomers , she reflected on her experience of going through the same hardship in the past : “I went through so much trouble when I didn’t have information . Even one piece of information helps . I want to help , no matter how small it is” ( P2 ) . 4 . 1 . 2 Without social attachment , members leave the community . Surprisingly , some members volun - tarily chose to quit the community after they received the help they needed . This is contradictory against the theory of reciprocity , which suggests members return favor upon receiving . These members who left the community after receiving help perceived the community differently from how the members who remained and provided support perceived the community . While those who inclined to leave perceived the community as a source of information , those who remained in the community had adopted the community as a site of everyday social interaction . This suggests that the norm of reciprocity in a large online community is more likely to operate when users adopt the community as a social group than when users perceive the community merely as a source of information . Below , we describe the two different types of the users . First , many participants had built social attachment to and were enjoying casual social interac - tion in the community . They initially joined Gomusin Café with the specific purpose of seeking information but later began using the community for casual social interaction : “Nowadays , I log in when I am bored or when the café just comes to my mind . I become curious , ‘what are the members doing right now ? ’” ( P2 ) They often sought for advice about the issues that are irrelevant to military , such as which color of a dress to buy ( P4 ) and which part - time job to get ( P5 ) . P3 even made a parallel between Gomusin Café and other Social Networking Sites , stating that she “casually check ( s ) ” Gomusin Café as she would check Facebook or Instagram when she is bored . Building social attachment to the community and adopting the community as a site of everyday social interaction allowed members not only to stay in the community but also to contribute more actively . For the members who built social attachment to the community , contribution became an easier and more casual behavior ; they contributed to the community even without the intention to ’help’ someone . When asked why they help others by commenting on the support seeking posts , some participants said that they did not intend to help anyone : “I just comment because I see the post . . . I didn’t have a particular motivation to help someone . ” ( P4 ) . For some participants , contributing to the community is a fun activity they do in a close social circle : “I never thought this is a spending of any time or energy . I could not find anyone off - line who has the same concern as I do . And I could find the exact people I was looking for online . Wow . I really was looking for these people . I actually wanted to ask their Kakaotalk ID ( laugh ) . Maybe my personality is a bit nosy , but I love to empathize with others . I wanted to interact with them as much as possible through commenting” ( P6 ) ; “I like reading different peoples’ stories . I feel like missing out if I don’t log in every day” ( P15 ) . In contrast , some participants were planning not to log in as much after the training camp period is over . Sticking strictly to the informational use of the community , these participants often viewed building social attachment to the community as negative . For example , P12 shared her concern about how the non - informative interaction on Gomusin Café might harm the romantic relationship : “I think people who keep using it do so to gossip about their and others’ relationships , like to talk about the fight they had with their boyfriends . I think that’s unhealthy . If the couple has a problem , they should solve it by themselves . When sharing the problem with others , misunderstandings may occur , and the problem can become worse . I think posting is not the best way to solve the problem . ” P3 expressed her concern over talking about the personal and intimate issues with strangers : “We don’t know each other . They are people I met online . I don’t feel comfortable having a deep conversation with people whom I don’t know well” ( P3 ) . She also shared how talking to others experiencing the same Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No . CSCW1 , Article 91 . Publication date : April 2022 . Reciprocity in Online Communities 91 : 9 problem can be exhausting : “this is a special situation where the sense of depression may be shared . I’m worried about becoming even more depressed when I can’t see my boyfriend . ” Why do some people build social attachment to the community while others do not ? We suggest two possible explanations . First , the two groups may have had different experience after joining the community . Participants who had negative attitude on building social attachment to the community mentioned some specific usages of the community as undesirable , such as sharing relationship - related problems . It is possible that in the earlier days of their membership , these participants might have been exposed to the depressing and negative social interaction , while those who successfully built social attachment to the community engaged in a broader range of more positive social activities . Second , the difference may come from individuals’ different beliefs and perceptions on privacy issues and online relationships . Some participants felt less comfortable with revealing too much about themselves online ( P3 ) or building close relationships with people whom they met online ( P4 ) . 4 . 2 How do people repeatedly exchange support with specific individuals ? 4 . 2 . 1 Members form close relationships in subgroups . Some members built more intimate relation - ships with specific members , with whom they exchanged support repeatedly . In specific , Gomusins with partners in a cohort often built a subgroup and repeatedly interacted with each other based on the cohort - based commonality . Soldiers in a cohort enlist on the same day and are subject to the same policy and schedule during the training camp . Even though all members in Gomusin Café already share the identity of Gomusin , those in a cohort share an even stronger identity : “We have tighter relationships , because we are cohorts who sent boyfriends to army on the same day to same place” ( P13 ) . In Gomusin Café , these subgroups were not bounded visibly by technological features like separate bulletin boards . Instead , there was a common practice to include the cohort number in the title of a post , especially during the training camp period . Then , Gomusins with their boyfriends in the cohort commented on the posts to share their feelings and to support each other . As the members interact repeatedly with each other , they remembered and recognized each others’ usernames . This way , individuals became increasingly more identifiable and targeted , placed in a situation conducive to direct reciprocity : “If the person is from the same cohort , I remember and check the posts from that user” ( P9 ) . In the subgroups , participants exchanged information that is more relevant and helpful to the members . For example , our participants exchanged most up - to - date information with the members in their cohort group . Gomusins in a cohort updated each other in real - time when they got a phone call from their boyfriends , because during the training camp , soldiers are only allowed to make a few short phone calls at random times . When a Gomusin posted that they got a phone call , other Gomusins in the cohort expected their boyfriends to call soon and kept their eyes on their phones : “I post when I get a call . Then , people ask what time I got it , and some of them worry that they haven’t got the call yet . Then people reply , ‘you will get it soon’” ( P9 ) . 4 . 2 . 2 Members migrate to another platform to build friendships . Several participants had built friendships with the members they met in the community . They tried finding someone who can fill the emptiness that they felt after their significant others suddenly become unavailable . Explaining how she started talking to a member in her cohort every day , P10 said , “We suddenly lost someone we used to talk to every day . We felt so empty , and we wanted a replacement” ( P10 ) . Gomusins who built this kind of intimate relationships shared more than just information : “We not only talk about the military stuff , but casual things like ‘I went to this place , I did this today , ’ just like I would with my friend” ( P10 ) .

Publication date : April 2022 . 91 : 10 Chelsea Kim and Hao - Chuan Wang Interestingly , our participants built and maintained friendships on Kakaotalk , a popular messaging platform in South Korea , instead of in Gomusin Café . They met each other in Gomusin Café but migrated to Kakaotalk to continue the interaction . For example , P6 recognized the username of a member when the member commented on her post for the second time in Gomusin Café . She “talked to the member super friendly on comment” ( P6 ) . After realizing that they had very similar personality and interests , they exchanged Kakaotalk IDs and “became real - life besties” ( P6 ) . P15 also developed an off - line friendship on Kakaotalk : “I moved from Gwangju to Seoul . I’m living with my boyfriend’s parents , and we are planning to get married . My boyfriend is in the army , and I moved to Seoul to wait until he gets discharged . I don’t have any friends in Seoul . I posted seeking for Gomusins living in the area . Someone commented , and we moved onto Kakaotalk . We became good friends . ” ( P15 ) . We found two reasons behind the migration for the continued personal - level interactions . First , in terms of the sociotechnical features , the bulletin board system adopted by Gomusin Café has some limitations in promoting repeated and intimate interaction . P4 was concerned about seeking support for personal issues in the place where anyone can read the post and comments : “Commenting on Gomusin Café is too public , since she is talking about her private problem . ” P12 described Kakaotalk as more “accessible , ” because it sends alerts every time she receives a message , whereas Gomusin Café requires the users to log in and check their posts . We found that the bulletin board system also makes members deindividuate others , discouraging the members building intimate relationships . Most of our participants did not even remember the usernames of those who helped them before . Instead , they remembered the helper as ‘a member of the community’ : “I don’t think I will ever remember . I just think ‘a member’ commented” ( P2 ) ; “If someone comments , I think ‘someone commented . ’ If the number of view increases , I think ‘the view increased . ’ I don’t care too much about who commented” ( P5 ) . Direct reciprocity is unlikely when the deindividuation happens , as one must feel the sense of indebtedness to the specific individual helper in order to practice direct reciprocity [ 18 ] . Second , there was a norm among the community members that building friendships in the community should be discouraged . Indeed , two participants ( P15 , P16 ) informed us that the com - munity administrators moderate the friendship building behaviors . The members “cannot build friendship” and are required to “talk formally” to each other , or the administrators contact them individually to give warning . Both participants who mentioned this policy agreed with the policy . They viewed it as necessary to promote an inclusive environment for everyone : “Gomusin Cafe is a large group of people . Some people may feel isolated , some might feel uncomfortable . I think that’s why the administrators prevent us from building friendships” ( P15 ) . P16 pointed out that if there are certain “central members” who already have tight relationships among themselves , newcomers may not feel welcomed or comfortable to ask for help . 5 DISCUSSION In the interviews of the 16 members of Gomusin Café , we aimed to understand how online support community members practice generalized and direct reciprocity . Through this case study , we found that generalized and direct reciprocity guide different types of participation and that the two types of participation exhibit different characteristics . We also identified several factors facilitating and hindering the two types of reciprocity . Summary of the practice of the two types of reciprocity is in Table 2 . Below , we discuss our key findings as well as their theoretical and practical implications . 5 . 1 Members contribute to the community following the lifecycle of reciprocity Our findings draw a detailed picture of how online community members practice reciprocity throughout their membership ( See Figure 1 ) . Previous studies have found that individuals exhibit the pattern of reciprocity in online communities [ 13 , 25 ] , but the cross - sectional and quantitative Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No . CSCW1 , Article 91 . Publication date : April 2022 . Reciprocity in Online Communities 91 : 11 Table 2 . Description of Different Types of Reciprocity in Online Communities nature of these studies left us unclear about the specific process . We found that members of Gomusin Café practice generalized reciprocity longitudinally , instead of giving and receiving support at the same time . In the early days of their membership , the members participated primarily as receivers of informational support by reading informative posts and comments . Then , as they achieved seniority , they often transformed to contributors by reciprocating the support to the incoming members . Fig . 1 . Lifecycle of Reciprocity in Online Communities Our findings resonate with the Reader - to - Leader framework [ 43 ] , which proposes that users transition from readers to contributors , collaborators , and then to leaders in online communities . The framework suggests that in each transition step , many users terminate their participation instead of moving onto the new role . For example , only a small portion of readers transform to contributors . What’s important for the CSCW community is to understand the bottleneck in users’ transformation from one stage to another , so that we can devise interventions to support Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No . CSCW1 , Article 91 . Publication date : April 2022 . 91 : 12 Chelsea Kim and Hao - Chuan Wang individuals and communities effectively . In the current study , we identified two processes that precede this transformation , which should be addressed in the design of online communities to prevent members from quitting and to promote contribution . First , members experienced empathy and sense of solidarity which came from experiencing a common hardship . This is consistent to the claim of Preece and Schneiderman [ 43 ] that in designing online communities , forming an atmosphere of empathy and trust that promotes belonging to the community is important for promoting contribution . Second , members had to form social attachment to the community to remain in the community after achieving the informational utility . It emerged as a clear theme that members had to perceive community not only as a source of information but also as a place of everyday social interaction . This finding provides a novel and important insight into the research of reciprocity in online communities . In online communities as large as the one that we studied , the mechanism of reciprocity may operate only after individuals perceive the community as their social group instead of as an information repository . Conventionally , in CSCW , the work - oriented information sharing and the relationship - oriented social support are studied and designed rather separately and differently [ 11 , 36 , 48 , 51 ] . However , results from the current study revealed a need to understand the intersection between the two aspects in a unified and integrated manner . The model of reciprocity also appears to provide a feasible theoretical framework for describing the connection between reciprocal information sharing and the social dynamics among community members . Our study so far , however , has not yet clearly revealed what factors result in the individual differences of practice , making some people adopt the community as the site of casual social interaction while making others perceive the adoption as negative . We carefully suggest the different experience in the earlier phase of the membership and the different dispositional characteristics across users as two possible factors . Based on this suggestion , future studies focusing specifically on members’ adoption of online communities will allow more a sophisticated understanding of how to transform users from receivers to givers . Our findings add direct reciprocity to the lifecycle of contribution suggested in the Reader - to - Leader framework . We found that direct reciprocity is concentrated during a short time window during the first few weeks , especially within the subgroups of the members who share more specific similarities ( i . e . , day of enlistment ) . Within the large community with more than 500K members , members with the needs for specific support during a time window exchanged support in smaller groups where they built stronger bond and exchanged support more efficiently . This finding might be specific to the case of Gomusins , where members go through a uniform timeline of hardship . Nevertheless , we may reasonably expect this finding generalizable to the support communities for other issues , such as immigration , pregnancy , and cancer , of which members go through a common timeline comprised of different stages of hardships . 5 . 2 Direct reciprocity in online communities is a double - edged sword Even though members expressed the need and understood the value of building intimate relation - ships with other members , the practice of building friendship was not common in Gomusin Café . One reason is the technological limitations of the bulletin board system . In online communities adopting the bulletin board system , everyone can see all posts , and anyone can interact on com - ments . The openness of the bulletin board system made Gomusin Café a less desirable place to seek support for personal issues than other platforms allowing more privacy ( e . g . , private messaging app ) . Also , compared to the systems like Social Network Sites where users have their own public or semi - public profiles [ 3 ] , bulletin board system makes users to pay less attention to the identity of each user and more attention to the content of the posts . Thus , the system is not ideal for users to continue interaction with specific members and to reciprocate the favor to specific members . Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No . CSCW1 , Article 91 . Publication date : April 2022 . Reciprocity in Online Communities 91 : 13 However , the limitation of the bulletin board system in promoting direct reciprocity does not mean we should focus on improving the design to facilitate building close relationships . Indeed , our findings suggest that facilitating direct reciprocity in large online communities might be a double - edged - sword . On the one hand , it fulfills the members’ needs to have more intimate and emotional connection with others while going through the hardship . On the other hand , it may prevent inclu - sive environment for everyone , as the presence of the core members with tight connections among themselves may make the newcomers or peripheral members feel unwelcomed and participate less . This two - sided nature of promoting intimate relationships in online communities resonates with the negative consequences of bonding social capital [ 19 , 44 ] . Bonding social capital , which is often formed in strong ties or within homogeneous groups , lets individuals access emotional support when they go through crisis [ 20 , 44 ] . However , bonding social capital formed in a group leaves little space for individuals who are heterogeneous from the members of the group [ 19 ] . We propose the CSCW community to extend work on this dilemmatic nature of building sociality in online communities . It is also notable that building close relationships was moderated by the administrators . The moderation often made members migrate to another platform , which is the tendency previously observed in toxic online communities [ 21 ] . Even though moderation in online communities is essential to prevent potential harassment and hate speech [ 7 , 46 ] , previous work in CSCW also suggests that moderation in online communities imposes certain norms that might restrict some groups of users from voicing freely [ 14 ] and cause a spike in the moderated behavior in other platforms [ 21 ] . In the context of our study , the moderation policy aims to welcome the newcomers and to include the isolates . Also , the behavior moderated in the community , which is to build close relationships , is not harmful per se . Therefore , we believe that the negative outcomes of content moderation are less likely in the context of Gomusin Café . 5 . 3 Design Implications Based on the findings , we summarize the design implications of our findings : 1 . To retain members and foster role - transitioning from receivers to reciprocal contributors , online community design , both in terms of system features and social norms , should consider how to promote the building of non - exclusive social attachment in the earlier stage of the membership . Welcoming and engaging new members , promoting casual social interaction , and structuring more frequent and easier interaction within small groups could be some effective approaches . 2 . To enable more effective support exchange among the members sharing similar needs , online communities can consider supporting tools for subgroups , such as group - based messaging and chatting . 3 . To promote more extensive emotional support and sustainable relationships among the members while preventing the isolation of the peripheral members , online communities need to consider how to provide more private and accessible features for direct messaging , in separate from the public bulletin board . 4 . The overall design of online support community will benefit from recognizing and considering the patterned lifecycle reciprocity , which offers insights beyond the views only considering the cross - sectional and short - term motivations . 6 LIMITATIONS We would like to acknowledge some limitations of the study . First is the limitation inherent to the qualitative method . Since the context of this study is very specific , which is a community of people with their romantic partners serving in military , our results naturally might not be generalizable to all online support communities or online communities in general . However , while every case study Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No . CSCW1 , Article 91 . Publication date : April 2022 . 91 : 14 Chelsea Kim and Hao - Chuan Wang has its unique context , it is meaningful in attesting the general framework presented and followed in the literature . Our findings resonate with the body of literature led by the Reader - to - Leader framework , contributing to a more generalizable understanding of online communities . Also , even though the context of our study is compulsory military service which is unique to South Korea and few other nations , we expect our findings to be generalizable to other online support communities of the individuals experiencing a common timeline of hardships ( e . g . , pregnancy , immigration , cancer ) . Some of our findings might be specific to large - scale online communities , considering that Gomusin Café has more than 550K members . In smaller - sized communities , close relationships and direct reciprocity may be more common . Future studies can examine sociality and reciprocity in different types and sizes of online communities . Second , due to our sampling method where participants volunteered for the interview , it is likely that our sample is more active and contributing than the user population . Thus , our focus was put more on how people transform to contributors than on how people quit the cycle of reciprocity . Future work could investigate more in - depth how members quit the cycle of reciprocity before becoming contributors . Also , our sample was demographically homogeneous , with the female participants in early 20s , except for two . Considering different perceptions on social relationships and different social interaction behaviors across different gender and age groups [ 15 ] , the practices of reciprocity observed in our study may differ in the groups of other demographic characteristics . However , considering that reciprocity is a norm universal in human social behavior [ 18 ] , we expect that the findings will be largely applicable to the groups of diverse demographic traits . Interview studies with more diverse samples or large - scale surveys will address this limitation . 7 CONCLUSIONS To summarize , our study makes two contributions . First , we draw a detailed picture of how reci - procity is practiced in an online community . This picture allows a better understanding of the findings of the previous quantitative studies , which observed reciprocity mainly through the corre - lation between giving and receiving behaviors . Second , we applied a novel perspective to studying contributions in online communities , which views contribution as a social behavior . Applying this perspective revealed that contributing behaviors are contingent upon receiving help in the earlier days of the membership . Our findings emphasize the need to adopt more nuanced perspective in research and design of online communities instead of homogenizing users in different phases . 7 . 1 Acknowledgement We thank our participants for making this study happen .
