Pollard , Yale University , New Haven , CT , and approved August 21 , 2017 ( received for review May 5 , 2017 ) During their life cycle , apicomplexan parasites , such as the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum , use actomyosin - driven gliding motility to move and invade host cells . For this process , actin fila - ment length and stability are temporally and spatially controlled . In contrast to canonical actin , P . falciparum actin 1 ( Pf Act1 ) does not readily polymerize into long , stable filaments . The structural basis of filament instability , which plays a pivotal role in host cell invasion , and thus infectivity , is poorly understood , largely be - cause high - resolution structures of Pf Act1 filaments were missing . Here , we report the near - atomic structure of jasplakinolide ( JAS ) - stabilized Pf Act1 filaments determined by electron cryomicro - scopy . The general filament architecture is similar to that of mam - malian F - actin . The high resolution of the structure allowed us to identify small but important differences at inter - and intrastrand contact sites , explaining the inherent instability of apicomplexan actin filaments . JAS binds at regular intervals inside the filament to three adjacent actin subunits , reinforcing filament stability by hy - drophobic interactions . Our study reveals the high - resolution structure of a small molecule bound to F - actin , highlighting the potential of electron cryomicroscopy for structure - based drug design . Furthermore , our work serves as a strong foundation for understanding the structural design and evolution of actin filaments and their function in motility and host cell invasion of apicomplexan parasites . F - actin | Plasmodium | cryo - EM | jasplakinolide | malaria A ctin is a highly conserved protein abundantly expressed in almost all eukaryotic cells . In concert with a multitude of actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) , it is involved in many important biological processes , including cell motility , muscle contraction , and vesicle trafficking ( 1 ) . After the discovery and first purification of actin from muscle by Straub in 1942 ( 2 ) , it took almost 50 years until the first crystal structure of monomeric globular actin ( G - actin ) in complex with DNase I was solved ( 3 ) . Since then , structural models of filamentous actin ( F - actin ) have been de - termined either from medium - resolution electron cryomicroscopy ( cryo - EM ) maps ( 4 , 5 ) or by interpreting X - ray fiber diffraction data ( 6 ) , each of which has certain limitations . The introduction of new direct electron detectors finally enabled the determination of near - atomic structures of mammalian F - actin by cryo - EM ( 7 , 8 ) . Unicellular eukaryotic apicomplexan parasites , such as species of the genera Plasmodium , Cryptosporidium , and Toxoplasma , require actin for efficient host cell invasion ( 9 , 10 ) . Apicomplexan actin is part of a molecular machine called the glideosome . Myosin A , in combination with several glideosome - associated proteins , interacts with actin to create the force needed for gliding . Details of the un - derlying mechanism , however , are only partly understood ( 11 , 12 ) . While most apicomplexan parasites express only one actin isoform , Plasmodium falciparum has two different actins ( 13 , 14 ) . Plasmodium actin 1 is expressed throughout the life cycle and is closely related to the single actin isoform found in other apicomplexan parasites ( 15 ) . It shares 93 % of its sequence with the actin of Toxoplasma gondii ( 16 ) . Plasmodium actin 2 is only present in life cycle stages involved in transmission through the mosquito , including the gametocytes and sporozoites ( 15 , 17 , 18 ) , and cannot be substituted by actin 1 in ga - metogenesis ( 19 ) . Both Plasmodium actin isoforms are among the most divergent identified in one organism , sharing less than 80 % of their sequence with each other as well as with opisthokont ( animal and yeast ) and plant actins ( 14 ) . Monomeric P . falciparum actin 1 ( Pf Act1 ) shares its fold with mammalian G - actin ( 19 ) . Despite this similarity , there are small but appreciable structural deviations , especially at the binding interface of ABPs and the nucleotide - binding pocket . Further - more , the contact sites important for filament formation contain notable deviations , particularly within the DNase - 1 – binding loop ( D - loop ) which is essential for polymerization ( 4 ) . Although all apicomplexan parasites express actin , it has been difficult to directly visualize actin filaments in vivo . Besides one recent study that reported an actin - based cytoskeleton in ma - turing P . falciparum gametocytes using superresolution micros - copy ( 20 ) , studies of other stages of the parasites describe shorter filamentous structures in equilibrium with high concentrations of G - actin ( 21 – 25 ) . Stabilization of Plasmodium actin filaments using high concentrations of the actin - filament stabilizing agent jasplakinolide ( JAS ) inhibits parasite growth and impairs host cell invasion ( 26 ) . Thus , it has been proposed that the unstable nature of apicomplexan actin filaments is essential for parasite survival ( 9 ) . These in vivo findings are supported by several Significance The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum actively invades host cells , using a mechanism that relies on the interaction of the motor protein myosin and actin filaments which serve as tracks . We determined the structure of stabilized P . falciparum actin 1 filaments at near - atomic resolution using single - particle electron cryomicroscopy . The high resolution of the structure allowed us to identify important positions in the filament that are essential for the temporal and spatial control of actin po - lymerization and play a pivotal role in host cell invasion , and thus infectivity . In general , our study provides important in - sights into the structural design of actin filaments . Author contributions : I . K . and S . R . designed research ; S . P . , E . - P .

Pf Act1 filaments can be stabilized also in vitro with JAS ( 19 , 28 ) , a cyclic peptide originally isolated from the marine sponge Jaspis johnstoni ( 29 ) . Similar to the competitively binding phal - loidin , which has a weaker effect on parasite actin ( 30 ) , JAS dramatically reduces the critical concentration of actin subunits necessary to drive polymerization and stabilizes filaments ( 28 , 31 ) . JAS - stabilized Pf Act1 filaments are suitable for electron microscopy studies , as shown by negative staining ( 30 ) and cryo - EM reconstructions of Pf Act1 filaments ( 19 ) . Despite the limited resolution of the maps , it was shown that the helical rotation angle of JAS - stabilized Pf Act1 filaments ( − 167 . 5° ) slightly deviates from the one of canonical mammalian skeletal muscle F - actin ( − 166 . 6° ) , indicating possible different interactions of the actin subunits within the filament ( 19 , 30 ) . Biochemical studies on Pf Act1 and T . gondii actin filaments indicated that the D - loop , as well as an interface once called hydrophobic plug ( 4 ) [ sub - sequently referred to as “ plug ” because of its hydrophilic nature ( 5 , 7 ) ] , have an impact on the filament stability ( 9 , 19 ) . However , the structural basis of filament instability of Pf Act1 , which plays a pivotal role in host cell invasion , and thus infectivity , remains poorly characterized , largely because high - resolution structures of Pf Act1 filaments were missing . Here , we report the near - atomic structure of JAS - stabilized Pf Act1 filaments at an average resolution of 3 . 8 Å , determined by cryo - EM . We identify several small but crucial differences compared with canonical actins at inter - and intrastrand contact sites as the probable cause for the instability of the parasite actin filament . Small differences are sufficient to weaken key interac - tions at the plug and D - loop regions . We further show that JAS binds at regular intervals inside the filament to three adjacent F - actin subunits , occupying a hydrophobic groove that matches its shape . It reinforces intra - and interstrand contacts and , in addi - tion , directly compensates for weak spots in Pf Act1 filaments . Results and Discussion Structure Determination . Without stabilizing agents , only short , irregular filaments and aggregates of Pf Act1 are observed in negative - stain electron microscopy ( 9 , 19 ) . To exclude the pos - sibility that the staining procedure , including a pH shift to pH 4 – 5 and drying of the sample , disrupts existing but labile filaments , we vitrified nonstabilized Pf Act1 filaments and analyzed them by cryo - EM ( Fig . S1 ) . Although we screened different conditions , we could only identify short , irregular filaments and fragments , in - dicating that the staining procedure is not the cause for the in - stability of the Pf Act1 filaments . Because these short , irregular filaments and fragments are not suitable for data collection and processing , we stabilized Pf Act1 filaments with JAS for cryo - EM , as described previously ( 19 , 30 ) . This resulted in long , straight filaments , in which single actin subunits could already be distin - guished on the micrograph level , illustrating their regular ar - rangement within a double - stranded helix ( Fig . S2 A ) . We collected a cryo - EM dataset and processed it using a single - particle – based approach with external constraints and a priori values that account for the filament character ( details are provided in Materials and Methods ) . The constrained refinement converged into a homogeneous Gaussian distribution of pro - jection angles around the equator ( Fig . S2 B ) . In the case of fil - aments , the reported average resolution is often affected by the edges , which are prone to processing artifacts , and the internal flexibility of the protein ( 32 ) . This is also true for the 3D re - construction of Pf Act1 filaments ( Fig . 1 A ) . Although the average resolution is 3 . 8 Å , the local resolution of the central fraction is between 3 . 2 Å and 3 . 6 Å ( Fig . S2 C and D ) . Based on the ob - served resolution gradient , we built an atomic model for the central part of the filament only , containing five actin subunits ( Fig . 1 A and B ) . We could clearly identify map density corre - sponding to ADP and the coordinated cation , most probably Mg 2 + ( Fig . 1 C ) . The coordination within the nucleotide - binding site of filamentous Pf Act1 is remarkably similar to that of canonical F - actin ( Fig . S3 ) . In addition , JAS could be assigned to map den - sities residing at the center of the filament , intercalating between actin subunits ( Fig . 1 A and D ) . The orientation of JAS within the map is unambiguous , although the bromine moiety is under - represented , most likely due to radiation damage ( Fig . 1 D ) . Filament Architecture and Interfaces in Pf Act1 . Filamentous JAS - stabilized Pf Act1 arranges in a polar double - stranded helix ( Fig . 1 A ) and shares its general filament architecture with mammalian F - actin ( 7 ) . As reported previously ( 19 , 30 ) , however , the helical rotation angle ( also known as the helical twist , d φ ) of JAS - stabilized Pf Act1 is − ( 167 . 5 ± 0 . 1 ) ° , deviating from the value for canonical actin of − 166 . 6° by ∼ 1° . The helical rise , dz , of ( 27 . 42 ± 0 . 02 ) Å is similar to canonical actin . Previously , the helical symmetry was refined using a single - particle – based heli - cal reconstruction approach ( 19 ) . In our case , since we built our atomic model into a nonsymmetrized ( C1 ) electron density map at 3 . 8 Å resolution , we could determine the helical symmetry parameters of the filament in an alternative way and just overlay the subunits of the model . In general , the values describing the helical symmetry directly depend on the pixel size , which is dif - ficult to determine accurately . A standard method to measure the pixel size of a given microscope setup is to use a calibration specimen with known dimensions . Depending on the specimen , the inaccuracy of the derived value can be as large as 1 – 5 % . Since the pixel size has a noteworthy impact on the helical symmetry parameters , it is best to compare parameters retrieved from the same microscope setup . For a direct comparison , we therefore determined the helical symmetry parameters of an atomic model of canonical F - actin , originating from a dataset that was collected on the same microscope using comparable set - tings ( results will be published elsewhere ) . The dz of this model is ( 27 . 4 ± 0 . 1 ) Å , and the d φ is − ( 166 . 6 ± 0 . 1 ) ° . These values corre - spond well with the helical symmetry parameters of F - actin that Fig . 1 .

We conclude from this that the calibration of our electron microscope is accurate and the twist of Pf Act1 filaments is indeed ∼ 1° larger than in previously determined canonical F - actin structures . The interface of the two strands within the filament changes slightly due to the altered twist . However , when examining the structures in more detail , we did not observe striking differences that might have an effect on the stability of the filament . All major interactions at the interfaces are present ( Fig . S4 ) . Only the position of the D - loop is clearly shifted relative to the posi - tion in canonical F - actin ( Fig . 2 ) . However , the hydrophobic in - teraction at this site with the adjacent actin subunit is not affected , and therefore cannot account for the inherent instability of Pf Act1 filaments ( Fig . S4 C and D ) . The different position of the D - loop , which is also the least conserved region of Pf Act1 , is likely not the cause for the different helical twist . Namely , the D - loop in Plasmodium actin 2 is nearly identical in sequence with Pf Act1 , yet actin 2 filaments have the conventional twist ( 19 ) . Conversely , the repositioning of the D - loop could be a consequence of the larger twist . On the other hand , replacement of the D - loop in Pf Act1 with that of mammalian actin leads to more stable filaments , which , however , still have the twist of 167 . 5° ( 19 ) . Thus , if and how the position of the D - loop and the unusual helical twist in Pf Act1 filaments are correlated remain to be investigated . The subdomain ( SD ) organization of filamentous Pf Act1 ( Fig . 1 B ) resembles that of the recent structure of canonical F - actin in the ADP state ( 7 ) . All major intra - and interstrand interfaces reported for canonical F - actin are structurally conserved in Pf Act1 . These include the plug region in SD3 , which is involved in mainly electrostatic interactions between the two strands ( Fig . S4 A and B ) . The D - loop in SD2 connects by hydrophobic interac - tions to a complementarily shaped groove in SD3 of an adjacent subunit within the same strand . This contact is furthermore enforced by Y170 , which inserts into the D - loop , resembling a lock - and - key interaction ( Fig . S4 C and D ) . In addition , there are two hydrophobic contact sites that have not been described pre - viously . The first interface consists mainly of V288 in SD3 , which enters a shape - complementary groove in SD4 of the adjacent intrastrand subunit ( Fig . S5 A ) . The second one is in close vicinity and is made up of residues 195 – 202 of SD4 , which interact with SD1 of the opposing interstrand subunit ( Fig . S5 B ) . Conformational Change upon Transition Between Globular and Filamentous Pf Act1 . The canonical actin monomer undergoes a conformational change upon polymerization . During the transi - tion from G - actin to F - actin , SD1 and SD2 rotate by ∼ 20° rel - ative to SD3 and SD4 , resulting in a flattening of the protomer ( 6 , 7 ) . When comparing the globular conformation ( 19 ) with the filamentous conformation of Pf Act1 , we observed that it un - derwent a similar conformational change ( Fig . S6 ) . During the transition from globular Pf Act1 to its filamentous form , the monomer rotates by ∼ 11 . 5° ( Fig . S6 C and D ) . The rotation is noticeably smaller than in canonical actin . However , in the crystal structure of globular Pf Act1 , the SDs are already rotated by ∼ 7° relative to canonical G - actin . This could be an intrinsic feature of Pf Act1 and could be responsible for the higher hy - drolysis rate in the G - form compared with canonical G - actin ( 19 ) . On the other hand , it could also indicate a certain degree of flexibility of monomeric actin . In this line , a recent study on MamK , an actin homolog from bacteria , revealed monomers with different interdomain angles within one crystal ( 33 ) . Such a difference in conformation or higher degree of flexibility could also reflect a different dependence between ATP hydrolysis and polymerization in the early - branched actins ( 19 ) . In addition , the smaller difference in conformation between the free actin monomer and the subunit in the filament may contribute to the instability of the filaments by favoring depolymerization . JAS - Binding Mode . JAS binds at regular intervals inside the fila - ment connecting three actin subunits that span both strands ( Figs . 1 A and 3 A and Movie S1 ) . It therefore mediates additional intra - and interstrand contacts . This is in agreement with previous mo - lecular modeling studies ( 34 ) . However , the proposed binding site and orientation of JAS differ substantially . JAS snugly fits into a complementarily shaped groove formed by the interface of SD4 of one subunit and SD3 of the adjacent intrastrand subunit . Its cyclic ring stacks onto a plateau formed by residues 198 – 202 of SD4 of the first subunit . The aromatic side chains of JAS enter between the two strands , separating SD4 of the same subunit and SD1 of the opposing interstrand subunit ( Fig . 3 and Movie S1 ) . The interactions between JAS and the Pf Act1 filament are of a hydrophobic nature . Hydrophobic and weakly soluble in water ( 29 , 35 ) , JAS binds to prominent hydrophobic patches inside the actin filament ( Fig . S7 ) . Interestingly , the hydrophobic patches are highly conserved in sequence , explaining the universal sta - bilizing effect of JAS on many F - actins , including those from green algae and higher plants ( 19 , 28 ) ( Fig . S8 ) . It has been reported that JAS influences at least the dynamic properties , thermal stability , and ATP hydrolysis rate of actin ( 36 , 37 ) . The structures of JAS - stabilized Pf Act1 and canonical F - actin , how - ever , are remarkably similar . It would therefore be tempting to speculate that JAS does not alter the filament architecture . Structures of alternatively stabilized Pf Act1 filaments and JAS - stabilized canonical actin , however , will be needed to prove this . Comparison of JAS - Stabilized Pf Act1 and Canonical Actin Filaments . To understand which residues are responsible for the inherent instability of Pf Act1 filaments and how it is overcome by the binding of JAS , we compared the atomic model of JAS - stabilized Pf Act1 with the atomic model of canonical F - actin in detail [ Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) ID code 5JLF ] ( 7 , 32 ) . Note that the sequence of Pf Act1 is shifted by one amino acid relative to skeletal muscle α - actin from Oryctolagus cuniculus . A compari - son of the backbone of both models revealed that the only large difference between them is the position of the D - loop ( Fig . 2 and Fig . S9 ) . This is surprising , since the protein sequences also differ Fig . 2 . Structurally deviating D - loop in Pf Act1 .

( C ) Backbone of corresponding atomic models in blue and green , respectively [ α - actin : PDB accession code 5JLF ( 32 ) ] . The observed differences within the D - loop originate most likely from P42 in Pf Act1 at the position of Q41 in α - actin that introduces a kink . 10638 | www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1707506114 Pospich et al . in many other regions between Pf Act1 and canonical actin ( Fig . S9 B ) . The D - loop of filamentous Pf Act1 is clearly shifted outward relative to the one of canonical actin ( Fig . 2 B ) . This shift is pos - sibly due to a substitution of Q41 to proline that introduces a kink ( Fig . 2 C ) . Although this shift has no direct influence on the in - terface ( Fig . S4 C and D ) , it might still slightly destabilize the intrastrand contact at this site and weaken the overall stability of the filament . In this line , a D - loop mutant , in which the complete D - loop of Pf Act1 was exchanged for that of canonical actin , formed filaments also in the absence of any stabilizing agent ( 19 ) . Interestingly , while the tip of the D - loop interacts hydro - phobically with the adjacent intrastrand subunit in both actins ( Fig . S4 ) , the outward - facing base of the D - loop is negatively charged in Pf Act1 and neutral to positive in canonical F - actin ( Fig . S10 ) . Although this may not have any effect on the stability of the filament itself , the change of charge likely has an impact on the interactions of Pf Act1 with ABPs , particularly coronin and myosin . Both bind to F - actin at the position of or in close vicinity to the D - loop ( 32 , 38 , 39 ) . A detailed inspection of the other interfaces revealed addi - tional small but important differences within the plug region and the JAS - binding site of Pf Act1 that probably affect the stability of the filament . The plug region is the major interstrand contact in F - actin and relies on electrostatic complementary surface potentials ( 5 , 7 ) . The general arrangement of the plug and the interaction with the adjacent actin subunit are conserved in JAS - stabilized Pf Act1 filaments ( Fig . 4 and Fig . S4 A and B ) . The interaction is weaker , however , in Pf Act1 because a substitution of M269 in canonical F - actin by K270 in Pf Act1 results in an inversion of the electrostatic potential and , consequently , repulsion at this site and weakening of the interaction ( Fig . 4 A , B , D , and E ) . Although the double - point mutation G200S / K270M for Pf Act1 did not result in long filaments in the absence of any stabilizing agent ( 19 ) , pre - vious studies on actin from T . gondii demonstrated that a point mutation of K270 to methionine increased the stability of filaments in the presence of a low amount of phalloidin ( 9 ) . This indicates that this site is indeed important for filament stability . However , its optimization alone is not sufficient to compensate for the instability induced by weaker interactions at other sites . At the position of amino acids R39 and H40 in the plug region of canonical F - actins , there is a lysine and an asparagine in Pf Act1 , respectively . Since lysine is less bulky than arginine , this results in an opening of the groove , in which glutamate E271 from the opposing subunit enters , weakening the key - and - lock in - teraction ( Fig . 4 A , C , D , and F ) . Asparagine , instead of histidine , deteriorates the electrostatic interactions at this site . Both resi - dues are located at the base of the D - loop , indicating that not only weaknesses at the tip of the D - loop but also those at its lower part can account for filament instability . This also explains the rela - tively strong stabilizing effect of the above - mentioned D - loop mutant , in which the complete D - loop of Pf Act1 was exchanged for that of canonical actin ( 19 ) . We found two additional interfaces that are probably desta - bilized in Pf Act1 filaments compared with canonical F - actin ( Figs . 5 and 6 ) . In canonical F - actin , a hydrophobic key - and - lock interaction of I287 located in SD3 with a shape - complementary groove in SD4 strengthens the intrastrand contact ( Fig . 5 A ) . In Pf Act1 , this isoleucine is replaced by valine , which is still hy - drophobic but less bulky . Consequently , it does not match the shape of the groove and is a greater distance away from the hydrophobic interface ( Fig . 5 B ) . By binding to both interstrand subunits , JAS reinforces the interaction that is weakened in Pf Act1 , explaining its stabilizing effect ( Fig . 5 C ) . A prominent hydrophobic patch on SD4 spans the inward - directed surface of canonical F - actin and interacts with a hy - drophobic region on SD1 of the opposing interstrand subunit ( Figs . 5 A and 6 A ) . While the opposing surface is the same in Pf Act1 , the surface of SD4 is less hydrophobic . This is mainly due to a substitution of T194 and V201 by histidine and serine , respectively . In addition , S199 is replaced by a glycine ( G200 ) that is less bulky , and thus reduces the surface available for the interaction as well as consequently weakening the interaction at Fig . 4 .

Supporting this observation , phalloidin - stabilized F - actin from T . gondii could be further stabilized by replacing G200 by serine ( 9 ) . In Pf Act1 , however , the double - point mutation G200S / K270M did not result in stable filaments ( 19 ) , indicating that stabilizing the filament only at one position cannot compensate for the instabilities in other regions as dis - cussed above . Interestingly , JAS binds exactly at the interface between SD1 and SD4 ( Fig . 6 C ) . Since it is hydrophobic itself , it most likely compensates for the loss of hydrophobicity at this interface , and thereby stabilizes the interstrand contact . To support our structural observations , we performed an in silico analysis of the energy landscape at the binding interfaces . The contribution of a certain side chain to an interaction can be evalu - ated by calculating the free energy change , ΔΔ G , arising from a mutation to alanine . We used Robetta to calculate an in silico ala - nine scan ( 40 , 41 ) for Pf Act1 and α - actin ( Fig . S11 ) . As expected from the comparison of the structures , the energy change at the plug interface is more prominent for α - actin ( Fig . S11 D ) , indicating a stronger interaction than in Pf Act1 ( Fig . S11 A ) . The hydrophobic key - and - lock interaction near the JAS - binding site ( Fig . 5 and Fig . S5 ) is also weaker for Pf Act1 ( Fig . S11 B and E ) , whereas the D - loop interface of Pf Act1 resembles the one of α - actin ( Fig . S11 C and F ) . Concluding Remarks The overall structure of Pf Act1 filaments is very similar to that of canonical F - actin . However , several small but important differ - ences at the intra - and interstrand interfaces can be pinpointed as being associated with the inherent filament instability ( Table S1 ) . This also highlights the high sensitivity of F - actin to small alterations at important interfaces . JAS not only directly com - pensates for these weak spots but also stabilizes the filament in general by mediating additional inter - and intrastrand contacts . Our findings deepen our understanding of actin filaments in general and lay the structural foundation for further biochemical studies evaluating the impact of specific residues . It is hoped that this will expand the current model of motility and host cell in - vasion by Plasmodium and apicomplexan parasites in general . It is likely that Pf Act1 filaments are stabilized in vivo by other proteins . A temporally regulated stabilization of filaments by , for example , coronin , glideosome - associated connector ( 42 ) , or myosin could lead to longer filaments when required during the parasite life cy - cle . Thus , further work is needed to elucidate the exact binding modes of these F - actin – binding proteins on parasite actin filaments . Importantly , our structure of a small molecule bound to F - actin also highlights the potential of cryo - EM for structure - based drug design directed to F - actin . Studying small molecules in complex with F - actin at atomic resolution is of particular interest . The high similarity of actins from different species requires the exact tai - loring of drugs to avoid nonspecific binding . Pf Act1 itself could be considered a possible target , taking into account the importance of gliding motility for the life cycle of Plasmodium . Materials and Methods Details are provided in SI Materials and Methods . Pf Act1 Expression , Purification , and Polymerization . Pf Act1 was expressed and purified essentially as described previously ( 19 ) and polymerized for 16 h at 20 °C by adding F - buffer components to a final composition of 10 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 50 mM KCl , 4 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM DTT , and 0 . 5 mM ATP . In JAS - stabilized samples , JAS ( Sigma ) was included at a 1 : 1 molar ratio to actin during polymerization . Grid Preparation and Image Acquisition for JAS - Stabilized Pf Act1 . An initial sample check and empirical adjustment of the protein concentration were performed using a standard negative staining protocol described previously ( 7 ) . For cryosample preparation , the protein sample was first incubated on a previously glow - discharged carbon grid ( C - Flats 2 / 1 ; Protochips ) , manually blotted , and finally plunged into liquid ethane for vitrification using a cryo - plunger Cp3 ( Gatan ) . Following sample optimization , the final dataset was collected on an FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope corrected for spherical aberration ( Cs ) and equipped with a Falcon2 direct detector ( FEI ) and an XFEG ( FEI ) operated at 300 kV . Image Processing . Images were manually inspected and drift - corrected using Unblur and Summovie ( 43 ) . Selection of particles was performed manually with sxhelixboxer in SPARX ( 44 ) , and CTFFIND4 ( 45 ) was used for contrast transfer function ( CTF ) estimation . An initial 3D reference was created from Fig . 5 . Destabilized intrastrand contact near JAS - binding site in Pf Act1 .

( B ) In Pf Act1 , isoleucine is replaced by valine , resulting in a weaker intrastrand interaction . ( C ) JAS ( gray ) binds close to this intrastrand contact , reinforcing the interface . Surfaces are colored from high ( yellow ) to low ( white ) hydrophobicity . Dashed lines indicate boundaries of actin subunits . Fig . 6 . Destabilized interstrand contact near JAS - binding site in Pf Act1 . ( A ) Interstrand contact of α - actin is mediated by the hydrophobic residues V201 and T194 ( Fig . 5 A ) . ( B ) Hydrophobicity is reduced in Pf Act1 due to substitutions to serine and histidine , respectively , resulting in a destabilized interface ( Fig . 5 B ) . ( C ) JAS ( gray ) binds at this interface and strengthens the interstrand contact . Surfaces are colored from high ( yellow ) to low ( white ) hydrophobicity , and ribbons are depicted in the color of the respective subunit . 10640 | www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1707506114 Pospich et al . a homology model of Pf Act1 ( discussedbelow ) using CHIMERA ( 46 ) and SPARX . The refinement and postprocessing were performed with RELION 1 . 4 ( 47 ) in combination with additional restraints to account for the filament character . Model Building and Refinement . A homology model of filamentous Pf Act1 was created using Modeler ( 48 ) with canonical F - actin [ PDB ID code 5JLF ( 32 ) ] as a reference structure . This model was flexibly fitted using iModFit ( 49 ) before it was refined in real space using PHENIX ( 50 ) . Further refinement was per - formed manually using Coot ( 51 ) to minimize model bias . An initial model of JAS was generated using Grade . globalphasing ( 52 ) and manually refined in Coot . The final refinement and validation were performed using REFMAC ( 53 ) . The data statistics are summarized in Table S2 . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS . We thank O . Hofnagel for his valuable assistance in electron microscopy and F .
