NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver injuries ranging from steatosis to steatohepatitis with or without ﬁbrosis . Fibrosis may progress to cirrhosis and complications including hepatocellular carcinoma . His - tologic ﬁndings represent the complexity of pathophysiology . NAFLD is closely associated with obesity and is most closely linked with insulin resistance ; the current Western diet , high in saturated fats and fructose , plays a signiﬁcant role . There are several mechanisms by which excess triglycerides are acquired and accumulate in hepatocytes . Formation of steatotic droplets may be disordered in NAFLD . Visceral adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity and insulin resistance results in aberrant cytokine expression ; many cytokines have a role in liver injury in NAFLD . Cellu - lar stress and immune reactions , as well as the endocannabinoid system , have been implicated in animal models and in some human studies . 145 A nnu . R e v . P a t ho l . M ec h .

AREV403 - PM05 - 07 ARI 10 December 2009 16 : 54 NAFLD : nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NASH : nonalcoholic steatohepatitis T2DM : type 2 diabetes mellitus INTRODUCTION Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) is a clinico - pathologicallydeﬁnedentitymostcom - monly associated with characteristics associated with increased cardiovascular risk , referred to collectively as metabolic syndrome . Fatty liver itself is independently associated with increased cardiovascular risk ( 1 ) and biomarkers of car - diovascular disease ( 2 ) , and , in obese individ - uals , it is a marker of insulin resistance ( 3 ) and diabetes ( 4 ) . Populationstudieshaveshownthat NAFLD itself is probably a cause of increased mortality ( 5 ) . By deﬁnition , NAFLD occurs in individuals whose alcohol consumption is in - signiﬁcant ( < 10gperdayforwomen , < 20gper day for men ) and is characterized histologically by at least 5 % steatosis and other parenchymal changes , ranging from inﬂammation to hepa - tocyte apoptosis / necrosis to ﬁbrosis . The most worrisome form of the disease is nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) because of the risk of progressive liver disease ( 6 ) . PREVALENCE AND RISK FACTORS The prevalence of NAFLD is increasing in parallel with the prevalence of obesity ; both processes are closely linked to insulin resis - tance . The worldwide epidemic of obesity and the prevalence of NAFLD are most certainly heavily inﬂuenced by , if not directly related to , the diet and relative lack of exercise of the Westernlifestyle . Themostrecentreportsfrom the Centers for Disease Control and Preven - tion ( CDC ) indicate that 66 % of adults in the United States are overweight , and that of those , half are obese . It is projected that by 2025 up to 45 % of Americans will be obese ( 7 ) . As a reﬂection of the geographical and ethnic spread of obesity , theprojectedpercentincreaseintype2diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) by 2030 is 32 % in Europe , 72 % in the United States , and ≥ 150 % in sub - Saharan Africa , India , and the Middle East ( 7 ) . Children and adolescents , who are signiﬁcantly less likely to have confounding processes such as alcohol use and / or viral hepatitis , are likewise affected by the increasing prevalence of over - weight , obesity , and the features of metabolic syndrome , and these factors are important as - sociations with the comorbidity of NAFLD ( 8 , 9 ) . Aswithothercomplexdiseaseprocesses , un - derlying environmental , genetic , and hormonal factors that result in phenotypic disease ex - pression have to be considered in prevalence estimates . Notable differences in predilection for NAFLD are found related to age , gen - der , and ethnicity . To date , none of the vary - ing methods for estimating prevalence can dis - tinguish steatosis and steatohepatitis resulting from nonalcoholic sources from those result - ing from alcohol abuse . Although it is rec - ognized that at present the only unequivocal means of diagnosis for NAFLD is liver tissue evaluation , this method clearly cannot be em - ployed for population screening , and outside the setting of a study , liver biopsy is only un - dertaken for clinically detected abnormalities . Serologic assays based on liver tests are fraught with difﬁculties , not the least of which is agree - ingonwhatconstitutestheupperlimitsof“nor - mal” for the common liver tests alanine amino transferase ( ALT ) and aspartate amino trans - ferase ( AST ) , as levels of these enzymes are fre - quently elevated in the obese population ( 10 ) . Also , NAFLD and even NASH with ﬁbrosis and / or cirrhosis may be present histologically in the setting of normal ALT levels ; 79 % of subjects with > 5 . 5 % steatosis by quantitative imaging had normal ALT in a large multiethnic population study ( 11 ) . Finally , imagingmayindicatehepaticsteato - sis , but no modality detects disease activity . Further , ultrasound evaluation is only accurate when > 33 % of the liver is affected ( 12 ) , and computed tomography is limited by radiation exposure . Quantitative steatosis measurements by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy are challenging to perform , but the technique is evolving ( 13 ) . Increased age has an unexplained impact on NALFD . In adult studies , the older indi - viduals ( 40 – 60 years old ) had hepatic steatosis 146 Tiniakos · Vos · Brunt A nnu . R e v . P a t ho l . M ec h . D i s . 2010 . 5 : 145 - 171 .

AREV403 - PM05 - 07 ARI 10 December 2009 16 : 54 ranging from 24 % to 54 % , compared with 18 % in ≤ 20 year olds ( 14 ) . An autopsy study of 742 unselected subjects 2 – 19 years old showed that 9 . 6 % overall had steatosis ( 15 ) ; when fur - ther analyzed , the data showed that 17 % of adolescents , compared with 0 . 7 % in the 2 - 4 - year - old range , were affected by NAFLD ( 16 ) . Increased age is also associated with preva - lence of signiﬁcant ﬁbrosis in NAFLD / NASH ( 17 ) . The role of gender in NAFLD and NASH is under evaluation . Early biopsy - based studies indicated that NASH more commonly affected women than men ; current studies of NAFLD indicate that men are more commonly affected ( 18 ) . The latter ﬁnding is in keeping with the stronger association of NAFLD with increased abdominal adiposity ( the apple - shaped body habitus ) than with total or subcutaneous adi - posity . The majority of studies in children have also shown a higher incidence of NASH in boys than in girls ( 16 , 19 ) . In all studies , compared with Caucasians , African Americans are signiﬁcantly underrep - resented and Hispanic and Asian individuals are overrepresented ( 18 , 20 ) . An apparent paradox in African Americans of high insulin resistance but decreased visceral adiposity and hepatic steatosis has been documented in a large popu - lation study by imaging techniques for quanti - tative steatosis and body fat distribution ( 8 ) . Given these caveats , the literature contin - ues to support the idea that NAFLD is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in American adults ( 20 ) , adolescents , and chil - dren ( 16 ) . It is estimated that approximately 3 – 36 % of the general American population has NAFLD , with increased risks to 95 % in pa - tients with obesity and 70 % for patients with T2DM ( 21 ) . Of these patients , it has been re - portedthat20 – 30 % haveNASHandthatasub - group will have the increased risk ( s ) associated with it for cirrhosis and its long - term complica - tions , including liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) ( 22 ) . Genetic predisposition studies are sugges - tive , but to date they remain too small for ﬁrm conclusions ( 23 ) . Studies have documented FFA : free fatty acid TNF - α : tumor necrosis factor alpha TGF - β : transforming growth factor beta familial fatty liver disease and cirrhosis within kindreds ( 24 ) . Another recent small study showed a trend toward familial clustering and maternal linkage for insulin resistance in patients with NAFLD ( 25 ) . Kr¨uppel - like factor 6 ( KLF6 ) , proposed to control several compo - nents of NASH as well as hepatic stellate cell ( HSC ) activation in response to inﬂammation and hepatocyte growth , has recently been im - plicated . Possession and transmission of alleles with a polymorphism in KLF6 in NAFLD were shown , then conﬁrmed to be associated with advanced NASH in two large multiethnic pediatric and adult cohorts ; a protective func - tional polymorphism was also identiﬁed ( 26 ) .

AREV403 - PM05 - 07 ARI 10 December 2009 16 : 54 TG : triacylglycerol ( triglycerides ) MDB : Mallory – Denk bodies HISTOPATHOLOGIC FINDINGS Although a plethora of noninvasive tests for di - agnosing NASH have emerged in recent years ( 28 ) , the literature continues to support the concept that liver biopsy is the gold standard for conﬁrming or excluding the diagnosis as well as documenting amounts of activity and ﬁ - brosis and architectural integrity ( 14 , 28 ) . The diagnosis of NASH relies not only on the pres - ence of the lesions discussed below , but also on the pattern ( s ) of these lesions within the hep - atic parenchyma . Thus , a simple listing or scor - ing of lesions is not considered adequate for diagnosis . Steatosis The unequivocal histological hallmark of NAFLD in both adults and children is steato - sis , the histologic manifestation of intracyto - plasmic lipid in the form of triglycerides ( TG ) within hepatocytes ( 29 ) ; by deﬁnition , steato - sis is always a component of NAFLD . The in - tracytoplasmic fat in NAFLD can take several forms : ( a ) large droplets of macrovesicular fat that ﬁll the cytoplasm , displacing the remain - ing contents of the cell and nucleus peripher - ally , ( b ) mixed large and small droplets , which can easily be delineated , or ( c ) rarely , in addi - tion to macrovesicular steatosis , foci of hepato - cytes with true microvesicular steatosis . Semi - quantitativemethodsforthehistologicalassess - mentofsteatosisarebasedonroutinestains , not on those that speciﬁcally identify lipids , such as Oil Red O . The most reproducible method follows the acinar architecture and refers to the percentage of liver parenchyma occupied by steatotic hepatocytes : 0 – 33 % ( or 0 – 5 % and 5 – 33 % ) , 33 – 66 % , or > 66 % ( 14 ) . Inadultpatients , steatosisismostcommonly observed in the perivenular , acinar zone 3 hep - atocytes ; in some adult and pediatric cases , steatosis may occupy the entire acinus . In chil - dren , another pattern of steatosis is observed in periportal , zone 1 hepatocytes . Finally , steato - sis in children is more commonly moderate or severe ( 19 , 30 , 31 ) than in adults . Steatohepatitis Adult pattern . The minimal histologic crite - ria for the diagnosis of adult NASH include steatosis , hepatocellular injury ( usually in the form of ballooning ) , and lobular inﬂammation , typically occurring with a zone 3 predomi - nance . As in other forms of chronic liver dis - ease , ﬁbrosis is not required for the diagnosis of steatohepatitis . Hepatocellular injury in NASH usually oc - curs in the form of ballooning , but it may also present as apoptotic ( acidophilic ) bodies and lytic necrosis . Several studies have shown positive correlations with both histologic and serum markers of apoptosis in NASH ( 32 ) , which we discuss further below . Hepatocellu - lar ballooning refers to enlarged hepatocytes , with rareﬁed cytoplasm , that may have a retic - ulated appearance or contain Mallory – Denk bodies ( MDB ; also discussed below ) . The bal - looned hepatocytes are predominantly located among steatotic hepatocytes in acinar zone 3 and are frequently , but not always , associated with perisinusoidal ﬁbrosis . Loss of the nor - mal intracytoplasmic deposition of keratin 8 / 18 ( K8 / 18 ) immunostaininghasrecentlybeenpro - posed as an objective marker for their histolog - ical recognition ( 33 ) . Lobular inﬂammation , usually mild , con - sists of small foci of inﬂammatory cell inﬁltrates composed of lymphocytes , eosinophils , and oc - casionally polymorphonuclear leukocytes . In addition , Kupffer cell aggregates ( microgran - ulomas ) and lipogranulomas may be seen in the lobules . Portal inﬂammation in NAFLD most of - ten takes the form of chronic inﬂammatory in - ﬁltrates . Varying degrees of portal inﬂamma - tion occur in NASH , and increased severity may correlate with increased severity of activ - ity and laboratory features of insulin resistance , but not with serologic markers in a large series of pediatric and adult biopsies ( 34 ) . However , when marked and disproportionate to the lob - ular ﬁndings or to ﬁbrosis , consideration of a possible concurrent liver disease such as hep - atitis C is given ( 14 ) . 148 Tiniakos · Vos · Brunt A nnu .

AREV403 - PM05 - 07 ARI 10 December 2009 16 : 54 The characteristic “chicken wire” pattern of ﬁbrosis in adult patients with noncirrhotic NASHisperisinusoidal / pericellularandusually is ﬁrst observed in acinar zone 3 . With progres - sion , portal and periportal ﬁbrosis may develop in conjunction with the zone 3 perisinusoidal ﬁbrosis , followed , in some cases , by bridg - ing ( central - portal , portal - portal , or central - central ) ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis ( 35 ) . NASH cir - rhosis is most commonly macronodular or mixed ( 14 ) ; studies from biopsy series have proven that steatosis and other lesions may not persist in cirrhosis . The term cryptogenic cir - rhosis has been applied to many such cases ; however , if prior specimens show evidence of NASH , the resultant cirrhosis is , by deﬁnition , not cryptogenic . Clinical studies had related caseswithtruecryptogeniccirrhosistounderly - ingclinicalcorrelatesforNAFLD , aswellasoc - currence of NASH in posttransplant liver spec - imens ( reviewed in Reference 14 ) . Other histological lesions include the following : 1 . MDB ( previously known as Mallory’s hyaline ) are dense , ropy , eosinophilic , intracytoplasmic perinuclear inclusions often found in ballooned hepatocytes . In untreated adult NASH , they are most commonly found in zone 3 and in areas of perisinusoidal ﬁbrosis . MDB alone , however , are not unique to and may occur in steatohepatitis of other etiology ( alco - holic or drug induced ) , chronic cholesta - sis , copper storage diseases , glycogenesis , proliferative lesions , and hepatocellular neoplasms ( 36 ) . When present , they are considered by most pathologists to be a useful morphologic ﬁnding ( 37 ) and are related to higher necroinﬂammatory activity ( 35 ) . 2 . Variable degrees and distributions of iron deposition within hepatocytes and / or the cells of the reticulo - endothelial system may be seen in NAFLD and NASH . Studies on the signiﬁcance of iron de - position and abnormal iron metabolism genetics in the pathogenesis and / or perpetuation of injury and ﬁbrosis in NASH have given conﬂicting results ( 38 , 39 ) . The hormonal iron regulator , hep - cidin , isunderinvestigationinobesityand NASH ( 40 ) . 3 . Ductular reaction , the presence of hyper - plastic ductular structures accompanied by varying amounts of inﬂammation and connective tissue at the portal tract inter - face , is thought to arise from hepatic pro - genitor cells . In NASH , ductular reaction is related to portal and advanced ﬁbrosis and may provide a pathway for progres - sive ﬁbrosis , as discussed below ( 41 ) . 4 . Megamitochondria ( giant mitochondria ) are intracellular , round or cigar - shaped eosinophilic structures and are com - monly observed in hepatocytes with microvesicular steatosis . Electron mi - croscopy reveals that mitochondria in NAFLD may show paracrystalline in - clusions , loss of cristae , and multilamel - lar membranes ( 42 ) . Unlike in alcoholic liver disease , in which megamitochon - dria are associated with progression ( 43 ) , the signiﬁcance of megamitochondria in NAFLD is not known . 5 . Glycogenated hepatocyte nuclei are vac - uolated and may be seen in clusters within the parenchyma . When located within periportal hepatocytes , they are consid - ered by some investigators to be charac - teristic of NASH ( 44 ) or diabetes ( 45 ) . Pediatric pattern ( s ) . Pediatric patients ( 2 – 19 years old ) have been reported to have differing histologic ﬁndings in clinically char - acterized NAFLD / NASH . Instead of the zone 3 accentuation of the adult biopsies , the former ﬁndings are largely portal based . This may includethedepositionofmacrovesicularsteato - sis , the predominance of chronic inﬂammation , and the ﬁrst stage of ﬁbrosis . In addition , many biopsies are characterized by ( a ) extensive , panacinar steatosis , the uncommon occurrence of deﬁnitive hepatocellular ballooning and MDB and ( b ) the absence of lobular inﬂam - mation .

The initial study showed that type 2 NASH is more commonly encountered in liver biopsies of younger , obese boys of Asian , Hispanic , and Native American origin ( 31 ) . Subsequent studies have shown that most cases of pediatric NAFLD / NASH , in fact , have features of both type 1 and type 2 and that the purely type 2 pattern is less common ( 19 , 46 ) . The switch from the portal - predominant pattern to the zone 3 pattern , which is more common in older children , may be related to hormonal or endocrine changes caused by puberty . Cirrhosis has been observed in rare cases in children with NAFLD / NASH , and this condition carries signiﬁcant concern for future health - related personal and societal consequences ( 47 ) . SCORING SYSTEMS FOR PATHOLOGIC EVALUATION Semiquantitative histological scoring systems have been developed for grading necroinﬂam - matory lesions and staging ﬁbrosis in NAFLD Table 2 Brunt scoring system for lobular and portal inﬂammation a Lobular inﬂammation ( L ) Portal inﬂammation ( P ) Degree Description Degree Description 0 None 0 None 1 < 2 foci / 20 × ﬁeld 1 Mild 2 2 – 4 / 20 × ﬁeld 2 Moderate 3 > 4 / 20 × ﬁeld 3 Marked a Adapted from Reference 35 . in both adults and children . A method of de - riving a global disease activity grade based on the major histological lesions of NASH , namely steatosis , hepatocellular ballooning , and lobu - lar and portal inﬂammation , was proposed in 1999 ( 35 ) ; the method noted that the signiﬁ - cant differential in activity is not the steatosis amount , but rather ballooning and inﬂamma - tion . The score also proposed a ﬁve - tier ( 0 – 4 ) staging method for the characteristic pattern of ﬁbrosis observed in NASH from zone 3 perisi - nusoidal to cirrhosis ( Tables 1 – 3 ) . Recently , the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases – sponsored NASH Clinical Research Network ( CRN ) pro - posed and validated a scoring system for the clinicaltrialsoftheCRN . Thesystem , amodiﬁ - cation of the 1999 NASH scoring method , cov - ers the spectrum of NAFLD . For disease activ - ity , the NAFLD activity score ( NAS ) is feature based and derived from addition of individual scores for steatosis , lobular inﬂammation , and hepatocellular ballooning . The staging system for ﬁbrosis was expanded to include the pedi - atric pattern of portal ﬁbrosis ( stage 1c ) , and the initial perisinusoidal ﬁbrosis in zone 3 was further divided into delicate and dense ( stages 1a and 1b , respectively ) ( Table 4 ) ( 48 ) . Sampling variability may be problematic in the histological diagnosis of NAFLD / NASH , as in other chronic liver diseases , but it may be overcome using biopsies of adequate length and diameter ( 14 ) . Sampling error may be an important consideration in the design and in - terpretation of trials and natural history studies ( reviewed in Reference 14 ) . PATHOGENIC MECHANISMS PROPOSED IN NONALCOHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS Scientiﬁc investigations into pathogenesis of NAFLD / NASH have increased exponentially in the past 10 years .

The commonly quoted “normal” amount of hepatocellular lipids is < 5 % lipid by weight ( 49 ) . In the normal hepatocyte , energy received from circulation of glucose , fructose , and lipids isstoredasglycogen , andincreasedlipidsarere - distributed to peripheral storage in adipocytes or used for combustion ( 50 ) ; there is little ca - pacity for storage of lipids . In NAFLD , the pro - cesses of lipid trafﬁcking are dysregulated with resultant increased intrahepatocellular lipids ( 51 ) , particularly as saturated lipids ( 52 ) . In adipose tissue , which is specialized for storage of TG , extensive overload with lipids results in metabolic incompetence and subsequent macrophage inﬁltration ( 50 ) . In hepatocytes , excessive lipid storage may directly contribute to organelle failure , including mitochon - drial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum ER : endoplasmic reticulum ROS : reactive oxygen species ( ER ) and other organelle stress , and may play a role in hepatic insulin resistance ( 53 , 54 ) . In cell cultures , exposure of hepatocytes di - rectly to saturated FFA leads to mitochondrial depolarization and to increased production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) ( 55 ) . However , studies also show that lipid droplets and for - mation of TG ( a stable fat ) safely sequester and release nonesteriﬁed fatty acids , thus protecting thecellsfromthelipotoxiceffectsofectopicfats ( 54 , 56 ) . Thus , the increased ﬂux of FFA from the diet and from DNL is proposed as a toxic “hit” to the liver in NAFLD ( 57 ) . It may not be TG per se in the hepatocytes that results in lipotoxicity , but rather the accumulation of TG may serve as a biomarker of increased hepatic exposure to potentially toxic FFA ( 57 , 58 ) and the pathogenic consequences thereof .

Many of the current concepts of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are highlighted . There are three major intersecting components : ( 1 ) increased visceral adipose tissue ( VAT ) and altered systemic and hepatic response to increased insulin ( insulin resistance ) ; ( 2 ) altered hepatic fatty acid ( FA ) export , oxidation , and desaturation within the liver ; and ( 3 ) the initiation and subsequent effects of lipotoxicity .

Gray arrows indicate areas of newer investigation and highlight developing work showing that steatosis and steatohepatitis are not necessarily interdependent processes . Increased caloric intake , in combination with increased saturated fat and fructose consumption , leads to increased VAT ; fructose consumption also stimulates de novo lipogenesis ( DNL ) and does not cause the satiety signaling that occurs with glucose . VAT is a metabolically active tissue that produces numerous proinﬂammatory cytokines [ tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - α ) , interleukin - 6 ( IL - 6 ) , and C - reactive protein ( CRP ) ] and is associated with decreased adiponectin , an adipokine that is anti - inﬂammatory . Both VAT and hepatic steatosis cause and are caused by hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in a feed - forward relationship . VAT also increases delivery of free fatty acids ( FFA ) to the liver via the portal circulation , resulting in an increased load of FA metabolism within the liver . DNL , increased reesteriﬁcation of triglycerides , and increased oxidation are all affected . In some patients , compensatory mechanisms to prevent lipotoxicity from the altered FA metabolism fail , and steatohepatitis and ﬁbrosis result . The circulating proinﬂammatory cytokines from VAT , lack of appropriate desaturation of saturated fatty acids ( SFA ) to polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) , increased reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) from oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress , and increased portal endotoxin have all been speculated to play a role in lipotoxity . Failure of hepatocyte repair and inﬂammation perpetuate the process ( es ) that initiate and promote ﬁbrosis . Abbreviation : VLDL , very low density lipoprotein . Failure of Lipid Formation and Storage in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease : PAT and CIDES PAT [ perilipin , adipophilin , and tail - interacting proteins of 47kd ( TIP47 ) ] are a family of lipid droplet – associated proteins that are actively in - volved in droplet formation and turnover ( 50 , 54 ) . Sophisticated techniques have shown the localizations and complex associations of PAT with intracellular lipid droplets ( 59 ) . PAT have been shown to play a role in insulin resis - tance and obesity ; they may also play a role in NAFLD . Dysfunction of PAT can result in increased size and decreased numbers of lipid droplets , as well as increased lipolysis with resultant insulin pathway dysregulation 152 Tiniakos · Vos · Brunt A nnu .

This remains an area of ongoing investigation . The cell death – inducing DNA fragmen - tation factor - α - like effector ( CIDE ) proteins ( designated CIDEA , CIDEB , etc . ) were ini - tially characterized as mitochondrial activators of apoptosis , but they are now being inves - tigated for their roles in cellular energy bal - ance ( 61 – 63 ) . CIDEA is thought to control lipid metabolism ; CIDEA knockout mice are lean and obesity resistant ( 64 ) . In a human genetic study , an association was found be - tween a polymorphism of CIDEA and obe - sity ( 61 ) . CIDEB knockout mice had increased adiponectin , increased insulin sensitivity , and improved plasma and liver TG ( 63 ) . CIDEC ( or fat - speciﬁc protein of 27 kDa ) is a lipid droplet protein that plays an important role in droplet formation . In vitro , CIDEC is suf - ﬁcient to stimulate formation of lipid droplets and necessary for lipid droplet expansion dur - ing adipogenesis ( 62 ) . Expression of exogenous CIDEC results in spontaneous accumulation of TG - containing lipid droplets ( 62 ) . Although PAT proteins seem to play overlapping roles in droplet formation , such that the absence of one has a minimal effect on droplet size , the absence of CIDEC inhibited large lipid droplet forma - tion ( butnotformationofsmalldroplets ) invivo ( 62 ) . Hepatic Steatosis : Lipid Disequilibrium TG in the liver can be utilized as metabolic fuel through oxidation , exported out of the hepa - tocyte as very low density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) , or stored . The primary sources of increased TG in hepatocytes are ( a ) fatty acids in the diet de - livered to the liver , the amount of which in - creases in systemic insulin resistance , ( b ) DNL within hepatocytes , ( c ) recirculation of non - esteriﬁed fatty acids from the peripheral tis - sues ( some from adipose tissues and some from skeletal muscle ) , and ( d ) inadequate removal via VLDL production and secretion . The im - balance between these inputs and outputs re - sults in steatosis and possibly contributes to inﬂammation and the subsequent downstream effects . Increased free fatty acids : dietary sources . Although “fat” is a generic term , it should not inappropriately imply uniformity of structure , function , and pathogenic propensity . Investiga - tions in humans ( 29 ) and in animals ( 65 ) show there are signiﬁcant differences in liver injury related to the types of fatty acids . Alterations in the type ( s ) of fat both in the diet and stored in the liver likely contribute to NAFLD . This has been studied in a variety of animal mod - els , most commonly in those with various di - etary manipulations . Even though a high - fat diet is frequently used to induce hepatic steato - sis , inprincipleitisdifﬁculttoalteronenutrient without also altering others . Thus , by deﬁni - tion a high - fat diet ( 60 % of calories or more ) is lower in carbohydrates and / or protein , making results more difﬁcult to decipher . Another chal - lenge with animal studies using high - fat diets is the common practice of simply referring to the diet as high fat without providing information regarding the balance of speciﬁc fats , such as ( a ) polyunsaturated fatty acids with several dou - ble bonds on the carbon backbone ( PUFA ) , ( b ) monounsaturated fatty acids ( MUFA ) , ( c ) saturated fats ( SF ) , ( d ) hydrogenated fats with no double bonds , and ( e ) various sugars . Buettner et al . ( 65 ) compared high - fat diets ( consisting of 42 % of energy from fat ) utilizing coconut oil ( primarily SF ) , olive oil ( primar - ily MUFA ) , lard ( mixture of SF and MUFA ) , and ﬁsh oil ( primarily PUFA ) in rats . After 12 weeks , the ﬁrst three diets led to signiﬁcant hepatic steatosis as well as to increased plasma TG , whereas the ﬁsh oil ( PUFA ) - based diet did not . A ﬁnal challenge arising from animal mod - els is histologic evaluation ; several studies re - quire use of special stains to demonstrate the tiny lipid droplets .

AREV403 - PM05 - 07 ARI 10 December 2009 16 : 54 concernsabouttheoverallapplicabilityofmany models to the human situation . Reduced availability of PUFA in the diet may also contribute to steatosis by favoring lipid synthesis over oxidation and export . The underlying mechanisms are incompletely un - derstood , but PUFA have been demonstrated to decrease expression of prolipogenic nuclear receptors such as sterol response element bind - ing protein ( SREBP ) - 1 and carbohydrate re - sponsive element binding protein ( ChREBP ) while enhancing expression of genes related to lipid oxidation ( 65 ) . In cell culture and animal models , SF cause steatosis as well as increased insulin resistance ( 66 ) . In NAFLD patients , a relative depletion of PUFA , particularly long - chain PUFA of the n - 3 and n - 6 class , has been observed ( 67 ) . Another research group found decreased levels of PUFA in the hepatic lipids in NASH patients compared with patients with steatosis only , or patients with normal livers , despite the fact that the reported diets of the patients did not differ : All patients studied re - ported that approximately 5 – 6 % of their calo - ries came from PUFA ( 68 ) . Several factors may be responsible for the lower hepatic PUFA con - tent . Fatty acid distribution in adipose tissue reﬂects diet ( 69 ) ; however , this may not nec - essarily be applicable to fatty acid distribution in the liver ( 68 ) . Further , defective desatura - tion processes , which result in decreased cellu - lar transition of SF to MUFA , have been shown to increase steatosis and hepatocyte injury both in vivo and in vitro ( 70 ) . Transfats ( partiallyhydrogenatedfatswhose double bonds are located in trans rather than cis , resulting in a less ﬂexible backbone ) occur both naturally from bacterial conversion and artiﬁ - cially from partial hydrogenation . Trans fats are common in modern diets , especially fast foods and baked goods , as they extend food’s shelf life . However , trans fats have been shown to cause NASH in sedentary mice , both alone and when combined with a high - fructose diet ( 71 ) . Tetri et al . ( 71 ) speculated that one possible result of increased trans fats was reduction in TG pro - duction , as plasma TG were not elevated . With increased recognition of the dangers of trans fats , these fats are being removed from many foods , but it should be noted that even foods labeled “zero trans fat” are allowed to contain up to 0 . 5 g of trans fat . Increased free fatty acids : de novo lipogen - esis and carbohydrates . DNL typically waxes and wanes in response to feeding and fast - ing , with increased synthesis occurring after consumption of a meal . DNL is increased in NAFLD patients compared to healthy subjects ( 72 ) and fails to increase in the postprandial pe - riod ( 73 ) . It is unclear how this contributes to steatosis overall , as Donnelly et al . ( 73 ) found that despite increased DNL in NAFLD pa - tients only 26 % of the TG stored in the liver were from this source . This defect in postpran - dialDNLﬂuxcanbeinducedinnormalindivid - uals as well as in hyperinsulinemic individuals via a high - carbohydrate meal ( 74 ) . Parks et al . ( 75 ) tested simple sugars to determine the li - pogenic response in healthy controls and found that acute fructose ( but not glucose ) ingestion doubles DNL , thus augmenting postprandial lipemia . Fructose consumption may be an important dietary contributor to NAFLD pathogenesis . Fructose is a monosaccharide that is commonly found in the diet as a component of high - fructosecornsyruporaspartofthedisaccharide sucrose ( cane sugar ) . It is well documented that fructose consumption has markedly increased over the past several decades , especially in the form of high - fructose corn syrup , a primary component in most soft drinks and “juice” drinks ( 76 ) . For reasons that are not well understood , fructose ( but not glucose ) fails to stimulate postprandial ghrelin or insulin secretion , thus failing to initiate the central satiety response ( 77 ) . Thus , high fructose con - sumption may result in overeating and weight gain , as well as in prolonged aberrant fasting hyperinsulinemia ( 71 ) . Animal models with in - creased dietary fructose have shown increased hepatic steatosis ( 78 ) . More recently , studies of NAFLD patients have shown that increased consumption of fructose ( 79 , 80 ) , soft drink 156 Tiniakos · Vos · Brunt A nnu . R e v . P a t ho l . M ec h .

Endocannabinoids in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis The endocannabinoids are endogenous lipid mediators that form part of the complex neural circuitry controlling energy intake and regula - tion and that elicit a broad range of effects sim - ilar to those of marijuana ( 82 ) . Interest in this system is increasing due to the demonstration of effects in the liver and the development of a chemical mediator , rimonabant , that antago - nizestheeffects . Theactionsofendogenousen - docannabinoids are mediated via cannabinoid ( CB1 ) receptors . These receptors are predom - inantly expressed in the central nervous system but are also found on adipocytes and hepato - cytes . Stimulation of CB1 has a broad range of effects , including increased lipogenesis , de - creased adiponectin , increased leptin and in - sulin resistance , and decreased fatty acid oxi - dation ( 82 ) . CB1 blockade improves increased adiposity and hepatic steatosis in rat models . In a two - year randomized , placebo - controlled hu - man trial , the CB1 antagonizer rimonabant re - sulted in signiﬁcant weight loss , improved waist circumference , and improved plasma TG and insulin sensitivity ( 83 ) . Effects of Steatosis in the Liver Accumulation of lipids , especially FFA , causes detrimental effects in the hepatocytes , includ - ing oxidative stress , induction of ER stress , and the uncoupled protein response and subsequent expression of proinﬂammatory cytokines ( re - viewed in Reference 50 ) . Exposure to fatty acids in vivo induces an inﬂammatory response , as well as steatosis ( 66 ) . Fatty acid oxidation . In normal hepatic lipid metabolism , fatty acids are disposed of via ei - ther synthesis of TG or oxidation . Fatty acid oxidation in the liver begins with the conver - sion to acyl - CoA and results in the production ofenergy ( ATP ) . Severalclassesoftranscription factors , including PPARs and SREBPs , control lipid metabolism in the liver . SREBP - 1c is the predominant isoform in the liver , and it reg - ulates other crucial downstream target genes involved in fatty acid and TG synthesis such as fatty acid synthase ( FAS ) , SCD1 , and acetyl - CoAcarboxylase ( 84 ) . ThecrucialroleofSCD1 in conversion of toxic SF to nontoxic MUFA , and in subsequent protection from develop - ment of steatohepatitis , has been shown both in cell culture and in animal models ( 70 ) . Adiponectin is a key factor in FFA metabolism . Adiponectin is decreased in obe - sity ; thus , its effects of controlling FFA entry and oxidation in the mitochondria are subse - quently decreased , allowing FFA to accumulate in the cytoplasm ( 85 ) . Mitochondria are the pri - mary organelles for glucose and FA oxidation . Although structural mitochondrial abnormali - ties have been observed in NAFLD , fatty acid oxidation in this disease seems to increase , not decrease ( 86 ) . This results in the production of ROS and in the accompanying downstream ef - fects of oxidative stress . Oxidative stess , insulin resistance , and in - ﬂammation . Oxidative stress ( deﬁned as an imbalance in the production of ROS and pro - tective antioxidants ) has often been linked to NAFLD ( 86 , 87 ) , and may be a ﬁnal com - mon mechanistic occurrence in the lipotoxic - ity of FFA ( 57 , 56 ) . Sanyal et al . ( 86 ) demon - strated that immunohistochemical staining for 3 - nitrotyrosine , a marker for oxidative stress , was elevated in liver biopsies from subjects with NAFLD and was even higher in NASH than in steatosis alone . Allard et al . ( 68 ) recently showed that oxidative stress in the liver tissue of NAFLD patients ( as measured by total lipid peroxides ) signiﬁcantly correlated with inﬂam - mation and that steatosis negatively correlated with a composite measurement of antioxidant levels in the tissue . Potential sources of oxida - tive stress include mitochondrial dysfunction ( 88 ) and depleted antioxidants ( 87 ) . Li et al . ( 55 ) demonstrated that exposure of hepatocytes to SF leads to mitochondrial www . annualreviews . org • Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease 157 A nnu . R e v . P a t ho l . M ec h .

Human studies that used vitaminEorursodeoxycholicacidtorepletean - tioxidants have had positive results in children ( 90 , 91 ) but , to date , none in adults ( 92 ) . Insulin resistance , deﬁned as the lack of ap - propriate downstream effects of insulin signal - ing , isalmostuniversallyfoundinNAFLD ( 93 ) . The association between steatosis and insulin resistance is clear , but the causal relationship ( s ) is under investigation . An early - phase rodent study based on differential fat loading in hep - atic tissue , but not muscle , allowed investiga - tion of hepatic insulin resistance in the setting of normal peripheral insulin sensitivity . This study showed a dose - response relationship be - tween an increase in hepatic insulin resistance and the degree of hepatic steatosis . Samuel et al . ( 94 ) proposed that the effect was mediated via blunting of steps in the insulin - signaling cascade , including ( a ) insulin receptor sub - strate ( IRS ) - 1 and - 2 tyrosine phosphorylation , ( b ) impaired activation of AKT2 , and ( c ) inac - tivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 ( GSK3 ) . Thus , lipid accumulation itself may increase in - sulinresistance , whichresultsinineffectivelipid handling and further accumulation in a feed - forward cycle . Human treatment trials focused on improvement of insulin resistance have in - cluded various insulin - sensitizing agents ( thi - azolidinediones ) , gluconeogenic agents ( met - formin ) , and weight - loss regimens ( reviewed in Reference 95 ) . Pro - and Anti - Inﬂammatory Conditions Obesity is considered a proinﬂammatory condition . However , not all obese and diabetic subjects have steatosis or steatosis with inﬂam - mation . It is the latter condition that more often progresses to ﬁbrosis and end - stage liver disease ; thus , inﬂammationhasbeenrecognized as a key pathophysiologic feature of steatosis . In 1998 , Day & James ( 96 ) proposed the “two - hit” hypothesis in NAFLD : Inﬂammation , caused by a “second hit” combined with the primary insult ( the “ﬁrst hit , ” which led to steatosis ) leads to progressive disease . Variations of the two - hit hypothesis exist , and more recently Jou et al . ( 58 ) proposed that a more important step is a putative “third hit” : hepatocyte death and lack of repair . They suggest that as combined oxidative / metabolic stresses and dysregulated cytokine production continue , hepatocyte compensatory mechanisms are eventually overwhelmed , leading to an increased rate of hepatocyte death . Necrosis can result in the production of chemoattractants that recruit various types of immune cells into the liver , and a ﬁbroinﬂammatory repair response is generated . As in other forms of liver disease , if this response is unregulated , it progressively distorts the normal liver parenchyma . Because bothsteatosisandinﬂammationareintertwined in a circular feed - forward relationship , NASH probably develops and / or progresses when multiple compensatory mechanisms carried out by liver cells are repeatedly overwhelmed . An example of an otherwise potentially protective mechanism that when missing or depleted may lead to increased hepatocyte cell death is the adipokine adiponectin . Role of Visceral Adipose Tissue Adipose tissue , rather than serving simply as a passive organ for excess energy storage , is a metabolically active organ with endocrine and inﬂammatory functions . This is especially true of visceral fat , which is an important source of a variety of cytokines , collectively referred to as adipocytokines or adipokines . This role may be the mechanism by which visceral adiposity contributes to NAFLD . Visceral fat is more metabolically active than subcutaneous fat , and it secretes more TNF - α and IL - 6 and less adiponectin ( 97 ) . Ethnic differences in visceral fat are under evaluation as potential links to understanding differences 158 Tiniakos · Vos · Brunt A nnu . R e v . P a t ho l . M ec h . D i s . 2010 . 5 : 145 - 171 .

AREV403 - PM05 - 07 ARI 10 December 2009 16 : 54 in NAFLD . In a magnetic resonance imaging study of hepatic TG content in over 2000 His - panic , Caucasian , and African American indi - viduals , Guerrero et al . ( 18 ) found that African Americans had lower levels of hepatic TG , de - spite similar total body adiposity and insulin re - sistance . Interestingly , controlling for amounts of intraperitoneal fat almost completely elim - inated the ethnic variation in hepatic TG . In addition , women had higher subcutaneous fat and overall adiposity than did men , but they had lower hepatic TG levels . Asians have in - creased amounts of visceral fat depots in re - lation to their body mass index ( BMI ) , and as such , are also at equivalent risks of diabetes andNAFLD / NASHasCaucasians ( 20 ) , despite lower BMI . In a comprehensive analysis of both fat dis - tribution and circulating adipocytokines , Van Der Poorten et al . ( 98 ) found that visceral fat was independently associated with both inﬂam - mation and increasing ﬁbrosis on biopsy in NALFD patients . For every 1 % increase in vis - ceralfat , oddsratios—independentofotherfea - tures of the metabolic syndrome—were two to one for increasing necroinﬂammation and two to eight for increasing ﬁbrosis stage ; this ﬁnd - ing suggests that visceral fat depots are primary factors in NAFLD . The study also showed that insulin resistance itself was not an independent predictor , but that IL - 6 levels were indepen - dently associated with histologic inﬂammation , thus supporting the key role of inﬂammation generated by visceral fat in NAFLD . Overall , abdominal visceral fat is most consistently asso - ciated with increased IL - 6 levels and C - reactive protein ( CRP ) , a systemic marker of inﬂam - mation ( 99 ) , and may be an important variable determining which overweight individuals de - velop NAFLD and NASH . Stefan et al . ( 100 ) characterized metabol - ically benign obesity by studying normal , overweight , and obese adults . Despite ﬁnding similar amounts of visceral fat , the authors foundincreasedskeletalmuscleTGandhepatic steatosis in the obese insulin - resistant group compared with the obese insulin - sensitive group . One conclusion was that hepatic fat , rather than visceral fat , is more important in determining the metabolic consequences of obesity . However , as only 56 % of the subjects in the obese insulin - resistant group had hepatic steatosis , it is difﬁcult to draw ﬁrm conclusions . Adipokines / cytokines . Abnormal cytokine metabolism is a major feature of all models of NALFD / NASH , and the most extensively in - vestigated adipocytokines in NAFLD / NASH are TNF - α , IL - 6 , adiponectin , and resistin . Obesity - related hepatic steatosis is directly associated with increased production of inﬂam - matory cytokines and decreased production of anti - inﬂammatory cytokines ( 101 , 102 ) . Several interventional trials in humans have shown a beneﬁcial link between weight loss and alterations of cytokines ( 95 ) . Cytokines are involved in the recruitment and activation of Kupffer cells ( resident hepatic macrophages ) and are responsible for the trans - formation and perpetuation of hepatic stellate cells to the myoﬁbroblastic phenotype ( 103 ) . Kupffer cells reside along the luminal side of the sinusoids and can be activated by exposure to portal and systemic circulatory products , in - cluding gut - derived bacteria , microbial debris , and bacterial endotoxins . Lipid accumulation in the liver is also associated with Kupffer cell activation ( 104 ) . TNF - α . TNF - α , secreted by adipocytes and by hepatocytes , was the ﬁrst cytokine known to be elevated in obesity and NAFLD ( 105 ) . TNF - α regulates inﬂammation , cell viability , metabolism , andothercytokines ( 106 ) andplays a central role in the response to endotoxin by generatingbothinﬂammationandapoptosis . As currently understood , TNF - α both promotes and is activated by insulin resistance via activa - tion of IKK - β ( inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF - κ B ) . Activation of IKK - β results in ac - tivation of NF - κ B , a proinﬂammatory “master switch” that regulates inﬂammatory mediators including CRP , plasminogen activator inhibitor ( PAI - 1 ) , TNF - α , IL - 6 , and IL - 1 β ( 104 ) . Im - portantly , TNF - α antagonizes adiponectin , an anti - inﬂammatory adipocytokine , so as TNF - α www . annualreviews . org • Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease 159 A nnu . R e v . P a t ho l .

F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y . AREV403 - PM05 - 07 ARI 10 December 2009 16 : 54 levels increase , the balance shifts in the direc - tion of inﬂammation . TNF - α has been shown to be elevated ( 107 , 108 ) in relation to the anti - inﬂammatory adipokine adiponectin ( 109 ) in human NAFLD . Speciﬁcally , TNF - α is elevated in patients with NASH and increases stepwise from obesity to simple steatosis to NASH ( 108 ) . In the liver tissue of NAFLD patients , Crespo et al . ( 107 ) identiﬁed increased levels of mRNA and a TNF - α receptor , p55 , and showed that circulating levels correlate with signiﬁcant ﬁbrosis . In obese ( ob / ob ) mice fed a high - fat diet , di - etarymanipulationtofavoranti - TNFpathways and anti - TNF antibody improved insulin sen - sitivity , hepatic steatosis , and visible inﬂamma - tion in the liver ( 110 ) . Pentoxifylline , a phos - phodiesterase inhibitor , was shown to prevent production of TNF - α , as well as other cy - tokines , and has had a modest positive effect in small studies of human NAFLD ( 95 ) . Adiponectin and resistin . Effects of visceral adiposity may be at least partially mediated via altered levels of circulating adiponectin , as in - creased visceral adiposity is a strong predictor of decreased adiponectin ( 111 ) . Adiponectin is produced by visceral adipocytes and demon - strates insulin - sensitizing properties via ( a ) ac - tivation of AMPK , ( b ) stimulation of glucose utilization , and ( c ) promotion of fatty acid oxi - dation ( 112 ) . Adiponectin and TNF - α are mu - tually antagonizing adipokines ( 113 ) . Unlike TNF - α , adiponectin is decreased in obesity , particularly with increased visceral adiposity ( 111 ) , and has likewise been shown to be de - creased in pediatric and adult NAFLD ( 108 , 114 ) and to have a negative correlation for hepatic steatosis ( 115 ) . This deﬁciency may be critical in the progression to NASH , as adiponectin may protect the liver from inﬂam - mation via direct antagonism of TNF - α . In two mouse models of hepatic steatosis , recombi - nant adiponectin inhibited TNF - α , improved insulin sensitivity , and improved steatohepati - tis ( 113 ) . In contrast to TNF - α , adiponectin hasantilipogenicandanti - inﬂammatoryeffects ; thus , imbalance in the TNF - α / adiponectin ra - tio may be important for NASH develop - ment ( 109 ) . Many therapies associated with im - provement in NAFLD have also resulted in increased plasma adiponectin levels including weight loss , decreasing visceral adiposity , di - etary PUFA , and PPAR γ ligands [ thiazolidine - diones ( TZDs ) ] ( 112 ) . Resistin is a proinﬂammatory cytokine also associated with impairment of insulin action ( 108 ) . In contrast to adiponectin , increased re - sistin levels have been correlated with NAFLD severity and NASH development ( 116 ) . Interleukin - 6 . IL - 6 is an adipocytokine as - sociated with NALFD and obesity that is se - creted in larger amounts by visceral fat com - pared to subcutaneous fat in obese adults ( 117 ) . Increased systemic IL - 6 was associated with in - creased inﬂammation and ﬁbrosis in NAFLD patients ( 98 ) . Using a transgenic model with twofold increased IKK - β to stimulate NF - κ B , Cai et al . ( 104 ) produced similar insulin resis - tance as a high fat diet . They demonstrated that both liver mRNA and plasma levels of IL - 6 were increased and that an anti - IL - 6 antibody signiﬁcantlyimprovedinsulinresistance . These ﬁndings suggest a sequence of cellular events : Steatosis activates IKK - β and NF - κ B , which then induces IL - 6 . IL - 6 causes insulin resis - tance locally and could be the link to systemic insulin resistance . High - fat diets in mice lead to increases in hepatic NF - κ B activity as well as to increased hepatic steatosis and mRNA lev - els of IL - 6 , IL - 1 β , and TNF - α . Feldstein et al . ( 118 ) clariﬁedtheroleofsteatosisinthismecha - nismbydemonstratingthatFFAactivatedIKK - β / NF - κ B via a cathepsin B – dependent mecha - nism that subsequently increased TNF - α with further liver injury . IL - 6 levels decreased with therapy in a small pilot study of vitamin E in NAFLD , whereas levels of TNF - α remained constant ( 119 ) . Gut : Endotoxin Endotoxin is another focus of investigation in the promotion of inﬂammation in NAFLD . 160 Tiniakos · Vos · Brunt A nnu . R e v . P a t ho l . M ec h . D i s . 2010 . 5 : 145 - 171 .

AREV403 - PM05 - 07 ARI 10 December 2009 16 : 54 Endotoxin , one of the components of the outer wall of gram - negative bacteria , is released by the microbiota in the gut and is directly in - troduced into the liver via the portal blood . There , via Toll - like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) , endo - toxin stimulates an inﬂammatory response , in - cluding increasing levels of TNF - α . Kupffer cells , the ﬁrst line of defense , are activated by endotoxin ( 120 ) . Marked activation of Kupffer cells in human NASH has been observed ( 121 ) . Genetically obese ( 122 ) and diet - induced obese mice ( 123 ) are sensitized to endotoxin hepa - totoxicity , and ob / ob mice ( who are prone to steatosis ) have increased small intestinal bacte - rial overgrowth ( 110 ) . Alterations in gut micro - bial ﬂora could presumably decrease endotoxin ; in animal models , antibiotics and probiotics have led to variable improvement in steatosis and inﬂammation ( 78 , 110 , 124 , 125 ) . Problems with examining endotoxin in hu - man NAFLD include the short half - life of endotoxin and the fact that systemic lev - els may not reﬂect portal blood levels . Ruiz et al . ( 126 ) examined 40 morbidly obese NAFLD patients and found elevated circu - lating lipopolysaccharide - binding protein ( a surrogate marker of endotoxin ) in NASH . Other researchers have found elevated plasma endotoxin in NAFLD patients compared to healthy controls ( 79 ) as well as increased small bowelovergrowth . Studiesinobeserodentsand twin studies in humans have elegantly shown metabolic alterations related to loss of diversity of the gut microbiota related to energy use and storage in obesity ( 127 ) . Innate Immunity in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Recently , several lines of investigation have focused on the interacting role ( s ) of the in - nate immune system in obesity , insulin resis - tance , and liver pathology ( 128 ) . Fatty acids candirectlyactivateinﬂammatorysignalingand hepatic insulin resistance as ligands for TLRs with downstream , intracellular activation of c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) and IKK . Liver - related innate immune responses to excess fat can directly result in hepatocyte apoptosis ( via increased FAS expression ) . All resident cells of the liver express TLRs . Their exact func - tions have not been fully explored , but the spe - ciﬁc TLRs demonstrated in NASH ( in ani - mal models ) include TLR2 and TLR4 , and coreceptors for TLR4 , CD14 , and MD2 have also been identiﬁed in these models . Intracel - lular lipid accumulation may sensitize hepato - cytes to ligand binding effects , and inhibitors of the TLRs have been shown to decrease inﬂammation and ﬁbrosis in dietary animal models . PROGRESSION OF NONALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE AND NONALCOHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS Hepatocyte Injury in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Hepatocyte injury in NASH results from the above - described mechanisms related to FFA lipotoxicity , oxidative stress , unfolded pro - tein response , adipokine / cytokine effects , mi - tochondrial injury , and inﬂammation . Histological forms of hepatocellular injury in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis . Two forms of hepatocyte death are recognized , although not clearly separated . One is necrotic death , in which hepatocytes become swollen and lose metabolic functions ; the other , a metaboli - cally active form of cell death is apoptosis . Apoptosis results in nuclear and cytoplasmic fragmentation . Hepatocyte ballooning . Ballooned hepato - cytes occur in many forms of hepatitic and cholestatic liver diseases . They result from mi - crotubular disruption and from alterations to the intermediate ﬁlament cytoskeleton in se - vere cell injury preceding lytic necrosis ( 129 ) . Their large cell volume may be related to in - creased ﬂuid in the cytosol ( 130 ) , accumulated fat ( 131 ) , or other factors .

Hepatocyte death . Hepatocyte death occurs in the form of lytic ( oncotic ) necrosis , apopto - sis , or a combination of the two ( necroapop - tosis ) . Necrosis and apoptosis are commonly the result of the same triggering factors and signaling pathways , and they likely represent extremes in the spectrum of cell death ( 132 ) . Necrosis leads to cell swelling , karyolysis , and rupture of the cytoplasmic membrane , whereas necrosis is a metabolically inactive event asso - ciated with ATP depletion and is commonly associated with an inﬂammatory cell reaction . Histologically , the presence of cell lysis is in - ferred from foci of Kupffer cells in the sinusoids ( spotty necrosis ) or from foci or regions of hep - atocyte “drop - out . ” Apoptosis is a highly reg - ulated , metabolically active form of cell death . Pathways for apoptosis have been characterized as extrinsic and intrinsic ; both pathways con - verge on the ﬁnal effector caspases to mediate cell death . The extrinsic pathway is activated by death ligands and their receptors , such as FAS and FASL , and by TNF - α - related apoptosis - inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) ; the intrinsic pathway is activated by mechanisms of cell and mem - brane stress ( lysosomal , ER , and mitochondrial injury ) ( 133 ) . In NASH , apoptosis correlates with other above - described components of disease inﬂam - matory activity and ﬁbrosis ( 32 , 134 ) . Serum levels and immunohistochemical detection of apoptotic markers , such as the M30 neoanti - gen , correlate with disease severity in NAFLD ( 32 ) , conﬁrming the role of apoptosis in NASH . Markers of apoptosis are included in non - invasive , diagnostic biomarker panels to pre - dict the presence of NASH in obese patients ( 135 ) . In NASH , apoptotic hepatocytes may be the result of lipotoxicity , mainly induced by sat - urated FFA , that can modulate both intrin - sic and extrinsic pathways ( 133 ) . The latter is a TNF - α pathway ( 118 ) , and the former is a mitochondrial or a lysosomal pathway involving either JNK - dependent activation of the proapoptotic protein Bax or direct Bax activation , respectively ( 133 ) . Genetic poly - morphisms of transcription factor 7 - like 2 , which predisposes to diabetes , may impact liver injury and modulate a fat - induced increase of circulating markers of apoptosis in NASH . Interestingly , the antiapoptotic B cell lym - phoma 2 ( BCL - 2 ) protein appears strongly ex - pressed in human steatohepatitis , probably rep - resenting an adaptive response ( 134 ) . Thus , on the basis of the recognized signiﬁcance of hepatocyte apoptosis in NAFLD pathogene - sis , it has been proposed that the develop - ment of progressive NAFLD in some patients , but not in others , may be the result of in - creased susceptibility of steatotic hepatocytes to apoptosis arising from abnormal regulation of BCL - 2 proteins , alteration in JNK activa - tion , or preferential activation of ER stress ( 132 , 133 ) . Other Histologic Findings Related to Hepatocyte Injury Histologic alterations within hepatocytes and the surrounding parenchyma constitute the constellation of lesions of NAFLD . Mallory – Denk bodies . Hepatocytes contain K8 / 18 . MDB , which are perinuclear , “ropy” eosinophilic aggregates , are composed of mis - folded , ubiquitinated K8 / 18 decorated by the stress - induced and ubiquitin - binding protein p62 , heat - shock proteins 70 and 25 , and α B - crystallin ( 136 ) . A high K8 / 18 ratio and keratin cross - linking by transglutaminase 2 play impor - tant roles in MDB formation ( 137 ) . Studies in transgenicanimalshaveshownthatbackground genetic susceptibility alters susceptibility to MDB formation and to liver injury ( 138 ) . Both the association of p62 ( an immediate early - response gene product ) with ubiquitinated keratinsandtheprotectiveroleplayedbyK8 / 18 in guarding hepatocytes from apoptosis ( 137 ) suggest that MDB represent the end product of the sequestration process of abnormal , possibly deleterious proteins and that they may 162 Tiniakos · Vos · Brunt A nnu .

During NASH development , the recognized aldehyde by - products of lipid peroxidation , HNE and MDA , can cross - link keratin ﬁlaments to form MDB ; MDB can stimulate neutrophil chemotaxis ( 139 ) . Furthermore , TGF - β may participate in MDB formation by induction of tissue transglutaminase ( 140 ) . Deﬁnitive MDB have been reported in only a few animal models of NASH . Megamitochondria . For a description of megamitochondria , see the subsection entitled Steatohepatitis , above . In NASH , mitochon - drial dysfunction results from reactive lipid peroxidation products , ROS , reactive nitrogen species , and TNF - α , all of which can block respiratory chain components , alter mitochon - drial DNA , and lead to increased mitochondrial ROSformation . Theadditionalﬁndingoffunc - tional abnormalities in mitochondria of skele - tal muscle in some cases of NASH has led to the suggestion that NASH may be a mitochon - drialdisease ( 140 ) . Analternativeinterpretation of the structural alterations of NASH is that they represent a generalized response to ox - idative stress , rather than being a result of cell injury , and that they may be a form of adap - tation ( 141 ) . Ultrastructural mitochondrial ab - normalities were found to increase following otherwise histologically successful therapy for NASH with a TZD ( 142 ) . Pigmented Kupffer cells / microgranulomas . Kupffer cells are resident macrophages within the liver parenchyma with close physical prox - imity to hepatocytes , stellate cells , endothe - lial cells , and circulatory products within the sinusoids . As macrophages , Kupffer cells en - gulf apoptotic and necrotic hepatocytes , and their digestion products may be visualized with histochemical stains ( pigmented Kupffer cells ) . Phagocytosis of apoptotic hepatocytes results in activation of Kupffer cells ( 143 ) . Other acti - vation pathways in NAFLD include proinﬂam - matory cytokine production , locally by hepato - cytes or distantly by adipocytes , and activation of scavenger receptors for the clearance of ox - idized lipids and gut - derived endotoxin ( 102 ) . Activated Kupffer cells play a central role in pathogenesis and the progression of liver dis - ease by contributing to parenchymal inﬂamma - tion , hepatocyte injury , and initiation of ﬁbrosis via cytokine secretion ( TNF - α , TGF - β ) . The loss of the normal periportal accentuation of Kupffer cells in normal liver to the zone 3 dis - tribution in NASH accentuates the zonal injury in this process ( 121 ) . Fibrosis Injury to the hepatic parenchyma and / or the biliarytreeresultsinwell - characterized , stereo - typic responses of the macrophages ( Kupffer cells and portal macrophages ) and of the ﬁbro - genic cells of the liver , the hepatic stellate cells , and portal myoﬁbroblasts that lead to deposi - tion of matrix materials with varying degrees of ﬁbrosis ( scar ) , and consequently , vascular ar - chitectural parenchymal remodeling . The end - stage form of scarring and remodeling , cirrho - sis , may lead to liver failure and carries a risk of HCC . Fibrosis and progression to the remodeled parenchyma of cirrhosis may be viewed as a failure of appropriate adaptive and repair mechanisms . There is an increasing appre - ciation for the loss of hepatocytes’ normal ability to regenerate and the subsequent activation of hepatic progenitor cells ( 41 , 144 ) . These complex processes ultimately involve activation of the ﬁbrogenic cells of the liver , primarily hepatic stellate cells , but also portal myoﬁbroblasts ( 103 ) . Epithelial - mesenchymal transition is another possible source of matrix deposition under investigation ( discussed below ) . Clinical tests to predict ﬁbrosis in NASH are based on the presence of serum factors reﬂecting ﬁbrogenesis , matrix depo - sition , and resultant liver dysfunction ( 145 ) . Any mechanistic understanding of ﬁbrogenesis and ﬁbrosis in NAFLD / NASH must account for several recognized features of the disease : ( a ) the patterns of ﬁbrosis noted in both adults www . annualreviews . org • Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease 163 A nnu .

Investigators have found increased CTGF protein and mRNA both in liver biopsies with increased ﬁbrosis in patients with NAFLD and in cultured stellate cells exposed to high levels of glucose and insulin ( 146 ) . Lipotoxicity , oxidative stress , and inﬂam - mation play recognized roles in the initiation and progression of ﬁbrosis in NASH ( 147 ) . In addition , secreted adipokines , including adiponectin , leptin , and the effector cytokines of the renin - angiotensin system , are central to ﬁbrogenesis in NAFLD / NASH ( 148 ) . The role or roles of PPAR γ and other nuclear receptors in treatment of lipid disorders , inﬂammation , and ﬁbrosis are also under investigation ( 50 ) . The recently proposed paradigm of concur - rent periportal ductular proliferation and por - tal / periportalﬁbrosis ( theductularreaction ) for the portal - based ﬁbrosis in chronic hepatitis C has also been shown in studies of biopsies from patients who have NASH with portal ﬁbrosis ( 41 ) . Theamountsofbothductularreactionand ﬁbrosis , as well as direct evidence of hepatocyte senescence and decreased hepatocellular prolif - eration , were shown to correlate with elevated serum levels of insulin and calculated levels of insulin resistance ( 41 ) . Epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , a ( patho ) physiologic process by which local en - vironmental alterations induce differentiation of mature epithelial cells into cells with mes - enchymal phenotypic markers and functions , is being demonstrated in a variety of inﬂamma - tory conditions of solid organs and organs with endocrine and / or exocrine function , as well as in cancers of solid organs . EMT has recently been shown to occur in diseases of the biliary system ( 149 ) , but to date no studies of EMT as a mechanism of ﬁbrosis in NAFLD / NASH have been published . HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA IN NONALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE AND NONALCOHOLICSTEATOHEPATITIS The risk of HCC in NAFLD - related liver dis - ease is commonly proposed but less well estab - lishedcomparedtoALDandotherchronicliver diseases that result in cirrhosis ( 93 ) . Two com - parative studies have shown HCC secondary to NASHcirrhosistobelesscommonthanthatfor hepatitis C virus – related cirrhosis ( 150 , 151 ) . Published rates of HCC in NASH cirrhosis and / or cryptogenic cirrhosis vary from 0 % to 47 % ( 14 ) . Recently , attention has been drawn to noncirrhotic patients with NAFLD / NASH ( 14 , 152 ) or metabolic syndrome ( 153 ) with HCC . CONCLUSIONS AND CONTROVERSIES As we have shown in this review , the mecha - nisms by which obesity and insulin resistance result in fatty liver , steatohepatitis , and ﬁbrosis are quite complex and are likely to differ in humans compared to cultured cells and the various animal models utilized to study NASH . The complex nature of the underlying ethnic differences and genetics of humans is challenging to dissect , yet it is known to factor into predisposition and severity of metabolic diseases , including NASH . The role ( s ) of di - etary components , energy use , and the central and peripheral nervous systems in liver diseases related to overweight conditions cannot be dis - counted . One of the fundamental controversies of NAFLD / NASH remains : What is the actual potential cytotoxicity of steatosis without inﬂammation and ﬁbrosis ?
