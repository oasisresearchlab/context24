The 14 emergence of VoCs fueled interest in understanding the potential impact of travel restrictions and 15 surveillance strategies to prevent or delay the early spread of VoCs . We performed phylogenetic 16 analyses and mathematical modeling to study the importation and spread of the VoCs Alpha and Delta 17 in Switzerland in 2020 and 2021 . Using a phylogenetic approach , we estimated 383 - 1 , 038 imports of 18 Alpha and 455 - 1 , 347 imports of Delta into Switzerland . We then used the results from the phylogenetic 19 analysis to parameterize a dynamic transmission that accurately described the subsequent spread of 20 Alpha and Delta . We modeled different counterfactual intervention scenarios to quantify the potential 21 impact of border closures and surveillance of travelers on the spread of Alpha and Delta . We found that 22 implementing border closures after the announcement of VoCs would have been of limited impact to 23 mitigate the spread of VoCs . In contrast , increased surveillance of travelers could prove to be an 24 effective measure for delaying the spread of VoCs in situations where their severity remains unclear . 25 Our study shows how phylogenetic analysis in combination with dynamic transmission models can be 26 used to estimate the number of imported SARS - CoV - 2 variants and the potential impact of different 27 intervention scenarios to inform the public health response during the pandemic . 28 .

Variants of concern ( VoCs ) have emerged which 31 are associated with increased transmissibility , immune escape , changes in disease severity , or a 32 combination thereof ( 1 ) . Alpha and Delta emerged in late 2020 and mid 2021 , and their transmission 33 dynamics were influenced by importations , the heterogeneous landscape of naturally acquired and 34 vaccine - elicited immunity and non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) such as surveillance of travelers 35 and travel restrictions . It was previously shown that the resumption of travel after lockdowns in summer 36 2020 led to the importation of a new SARS - CoV - 2 variant that fuelled epidemics in countries with low - 37 incidence ( 2 , 3 ) . In winter 2020 / 2021 , Swiss authorities tightened travel restrictions again for travelers 38 from the United Kingdom ( UK ) ( 4 ) , which were followed by overall stricter measures in Switzerland once 39 concerns about the newly detected Alpha variant were communicated . To date , however , the impact of 40 such travel restrictions and surveillance strategies to prevent or delay the introduction of VoCs are not 41 well understood . 42 43 Global genomic surveillance is vital to capture the transmission dynamics of different SARS - CoV - 2 44 variants around the world . Genomic and epidemiological data allow characterization and quantification 45 of the spread of VoCs ( 5 – 9 ) . At the end of 2020 , sequencing efforts helped to characterize the first VoC , 46 Alpha , that was initially detected in the UK , showing a 37 % - 100 % increase in transmissibility over 47 previously circulating variants ( 5 , 7 – 11 ) . In early 2021 , Alpha was continuously displaced by another 48 VoC , Delta , which likely emerged in India ( 12 ) . For Delta , studies have estimated an increased 49 transmissibility compared to previously circulating variants , which were predominantly Alpha in Europe 50 and North America , Beta in South Africa , and Gamma in South America , between 40 % and 167 % ( 8 , 9 ) . 51 VoCs emerge in one place and spread to different countries through travel . Therefore , quantifying the 52 impact of travel and imported SARS - CoV - 2 cases can help guide pandemic responses , particularly prior 53 to wide - spread vaccination . Routinely obtained surveillance data can provide valuable information 54 about the place of exposure , but can be biased ( 13 ) . Leveraging the wealth of genomic data offers the 55 opportunity to integrate an additional level of information to inform the impact of travel and importation 56 events . To try to prevent or slow the import of VoCs , some countries have introduced travel restrictions 57 such as vaccination certificates , testing , or travel bans . Although travel restrictions have not prevented 58 .

For 64 example , the early description of the emergence of Alpha was based on mathematical and statistical 65 modeling approaches and critically influenced the early response against the variant ( 10 ) . Phylodynamic 66 analyses have been used to study the evolution of infectious pathogens in intra - and inter - host systems 67 ( 15 , 16 ) . For example , BEAST ( 17 ) can be combined with compartmental transmission models to infer 68 epidemiological parameters such as the basic reproduction number R 0 ( 18 , 19 ) . Inter - host 69 epidemiological dynamics has also been used to study the importation of infectious pathogens such as 70 Zika virus , dengue virus or SARS - CoV - 2 ( 6 , 20 – 27 ) . Integrating phylogenetic analyses with dynamic 71 transmission models also has the potential to provide comprehensive inferences and projections of the 72 SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic . 73 74 In this study , we used a step - wise approach of phylogenetic analyses in combination with a dynamic 75 SARS - CoV - 2 transmission model to study the spread of VoCs in Switzerland . First , we reconstructed 76 phylogenies of the Alpha and Delta variants to estimate the number of imported cases into Switzerland . 77 Second , we modeled the importation and spread of Alpha and Delta in Switzerland . Finally , we 78 simulated the impact of three counterfactual scenarios to mitigate the spread of Alpha and Delta . 79 .

We accessed sequencing data via GISAID ( 34 ) on 15 February 2022 , to ensure the considered 85 sequences encompass the introduction periods of Alpha and Delta into Switzerland . We used a 86 combination of code from CoVariants . org and in - house scripts to select all Alpha ( Nextstrain clade 20I ) 87 and Delta ( Nextstrain clades 21A , 21I , and 21J ) sequences sampled in Switzerland prior to 31 March 88 2021 and 31 July 2021 , respectively , which are the dates when the proportion of each VoC was over 89 90 % among all sequenced cases in Switzerland . We then ran the selected sequences through the 90 Nextstrain ncov pipeline ( 35 ) , as modified for CoVariants . org , to generate ‘focal’ phylogenies . These 91 focal trees contained all Alpha or Delta sequences from Switzerland which pass quality control criteria , 92 alongside up to 10 , 000 global sequences that were most genetically similar to this set , and around 200 93 random samples , distributed across time , to provide genetic background . All global and background 94 sequences were also sampled prior to 31 March 2021 and 31 July 2021 , respectively . The final set of 95 sequences that we used for the analysis can be seen on GISAID under EPI _ SET _ 221003xn . 96 97 Phylogenetic analysis 98 To estimate the number of imports of VoCs into Switzerland , we collapsed phylogenetic trees into 99 clusters . As previously described in Hodcroft et al . ( 24 ) , we collapsed subtrees that contain only 100 sequences from a single country into the parental node recursively . We inferred an import whenever a 101 node without Swiss sequences led to a node with Swiss sequences . We used two approaches to 102 estimate the number of imports , referred to as the liberal and conservative phylogenetic approach , 103 which infer upper and lower bounds on the number of imports . When Swiss and non - Swiss sequences 104 intermix within a subtree , the conservative approach counted this as only one import , with further non - 105 Swiss sequences assumed to originate from parallel evolution outside of Switzerland or exports from 106 Switzerland ( Fig 1A ) . In the liberal approach , we treated each subsequent cluster of Swiss sequences 107 within the mixed sub - tree as a separate importation to Switzerland ( Fig 1B ) . 108 109 .

In contrast , the conservative approach considered only the earliest 111 clusters with a Swiss sequence as imports , which means that further potential imports were strictly 112 excluded . We chose the date of the earliest sequence of a cluster as the import date and shifted the 113 date backwards by seven days to account for the delay from infection to case reporting . All code used 114 to identify the selected sequences , to analyze the resulting phylogenies , to estimate the number of 115 imports , and for the phylogenetic builds can be found on GitHub : github . com / emmahodcroft / Intros - CH - 116 AlphaDelta . 117 118 119 Fig 1 : Illustrative example of the conservative and liberal approach to estimate the importation of SARS - 120 CoV - 2 variants of concern ( VoC ) to Switzerland . A : In the conservative approach , subtrees with mixed 121 Swiss and non - Swiss sequences are considered as one importation . Non - Swiss sequences are 122 assumed to be exports from Switzerland or to originate from parallel evolution outside of Switzerland . 123 In this example , there would be one import into Switzerland . B : In the liberal approach , each subsequent 124 subtree of only Swiss sequences is considered as a separate importation event . In this example , there 125 would be two imports to Switzerland . 126 127 Transmission model 128 Deterministic model 129 We used a deterministic , population - based transmission model for SARS - CoV - 2 in Switzerland that 130 was described by the following set of ordinary differential equations ( ODEs ) ( Fig 2 ) : 131 .

We estimated κ using a logistic growth model for the proportion of 145 the variant among all sequences ( Sup Fig 1 ) .

The model includes individuals that were 160 susceptible ( S ) , exposed to the pre - circulating variant ( E 1 ) or the imported VoC ( E 2 ) , infected with the 161 pre - circulating variant ( I 1 ) or the imported VoC ( I 2 ) , tested ( C 1 C 2 ) , recovered from infection ( R 1 R 2 ) . ω 162 denotes the importation of VoC as derived from the phylogenetic analysis . 163 164 We simulated the importation of Alpha and Delta to Switzerland during the period from 1 October 2020 165 to 1 May 2021 and 1 February 2021 to 1 September . We designated variants as either ‘Alpha’ , ‘Delta’ 166 or ‘other variants’ and the mathematical modeling analyses started on 1 October 2020 for Alpha and 1 167 February 2021 for Delta and ended on 1 May and 1 September , respectively . The initial state variables 168 and the model parameters were informed by the literature , demography , estimates , and assumptions 169 ( Table 1 ) . The initial number of recovered individuals infected with all previously circulating variants was 170 informed by the Corona Immunitas study and set to 15 % and 25 % of the overall population for 1 October 171 2020 and 1 February 2021 , respectively ( 36 ) . The initial number of exposed and infectious individuals 172 infected with previously circulating variants were based on the number of laboratory - confirmed SARS - 173 CoV - 2 cases , the ascertainment rate , and the infectious period . The initial number of exposed and 174 infectious individuals infected with the respective VoCs was set to zero . All other state variables , unless 175 otherwise specified , were set to zero .

( 38 , 39 ) 182 Counterfactual scenarios 183 We evaluated the potential impact of different intervention strategies to mitigate the spread of VoCs in 184 Switzerland in various counterfactual scenarios : 185 a ) Existing border closure : We assumed that borders were already closed at the time of the first 186 estimated import . We then simulated the opening of borders 1 to 100 days after the first 187 estimated import and introduced imports as estimated from that date forward . 188 b ) Implemented border closure : We assumed that borders were closed on the day of the 189 international warning about the VoCs . For Alpha and Delta , we stopped imports for 1 to 60 days 190 after 16 December 2020 ( 40 ) 24 May 2021 ( 41 ) . 191 c ) Increased surveillance of travelers : We assumed improved surveillance , quarantine , and 192 isolation of travelers . We reduced the number of imports by 1 - 99 % by sampling from the 193 estimated number of imports . 194 We calculated the time to dominance ( > 50 % ) of the VoC and compared it to the time to dominance as 195 observed in Switzerland . Counterfactual scenarios that did not reach dominance within the predefined 196 period were excluded from the analysis . 197 198 .

The model accounts for superspreading of SARS - CoV - 2 and simulates 201 epidemic trajectories with 1 , 10 , and 100 seeds , which can be interpreted as imports . The branching 202 process was based on a negative binomial distribution to describe the number of secondary cases , with 203 a mean corresponding to R e and overdispersion parameter k ( 13 , 42 , 43 ) . The generation time was 204 sampled from the gamma distribution with a mean of 5 . 2 days and a standard deviation of 1 . 72 days 205 ( 31 ) . For R e of the variant , we randomly drew 10 4 values from a uniform distribution between 1 . 05 to 206 1 . 15 . For each seeding scenario , we simulated 10 4 epidemic trajectories . 207 208 Results 209 In autumn 2020 , the effective reproduction number R e of SARS - CoV - 2 increased substantially which 210 led to a rapid exponential increase in laboratory - confirmed cases in Switzerland ( Fig 3A and 3B ) . In the 211 following weeks and months , cantonal and federal authorities strengthened control measures that led 212 to a reduction of R e ( Sup Fig 2A ) . On 16 December 2020 , researchers in the UK announced a newly 213 discovered SARS - CoV - 2 variant with a potentially increased transmissibility ( Alpha ) . In response to 214 these findings , the Swiss federal authorities introduced travel restrictions to travelers from the UK ( 4 ) 215 and increased sequencing coverage of SARS - CoV - 2 ( Sup Fig 2B and 2C ) . Nevertheless , Alpha then 216 replaced the previously circulating variants during a period of high incidence from January to March 217 2021 , pushing R e above 1 again . Based on genomic sequencing , we estimated that Alpha reached 218 dominance ( > 50 % ) in Switzerland on 5 February 2021 . In May 2021 , Delta was identified as a new VoC . 219 Subsequent growth of Delta in June and July 2021 led to an increase of laboratory - confirmed SARS - 220 CoV - 2 cases during summer 2021 . We estimated that Delta reached dominance in Switzerland on 27 221 June 2021 . 222 .

A : Number of 224 laboratory - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 cases per day . B : Effective reproduction ( R e ) number of SARS - CoV - 225 2 in Switzerland . 226 227 We estimated the number of Alpha and Delta importations to Switzerland using two phylogenetic 228 approaches . The Alpha tree contained 7 , 988 Swiss Alpha sequences , 9 , 901 non - Swiss Alpha 229 sequences , and 162 background sequences . The Delta tree contained 5 , 210 Swiss Delta sequences , 230 9 , 973 non - Swiss Delta sequences , and 147 background sequences . Using the liberal approach , we 231 found 1 , 038 and 1 , 347 imports of Alpha and Delta into Switzerland , respectively ( Fig 4A and 4B ; Sup 232 Table 1 ) . With the conservative approach we found 383 and 455 imports of Alpha and Delta into 233 Switzerland , respectively . 234 235 We then introduced these estimated imports in the deterministic SARS - CoV - 2 transmission model , 236 which resulted in 593 , 418 and 592 , 768 simulated reported cases from 1 October to 1 May with the 237 liberal and conservative approach , respectively , compared to 606 , 575 cases reported by the FOPH ( Fig 238 .

For 1 February to 1 September , we simulated 288 , 397 and 271 , 702 SARS - CoV - 2 239 cases with the liberal and conservative approach , respectively , compared to 260 , 933 cases reported 240 by the FOPH ( Fig 4D ; Sup Table 1 ) . 241 242 To better understand the dynamics of VoCs replacing previously circulating variants , we estimated the 243 time VoCs reached dominance . With the liberal approach , Alpha reached 50 % of all infections on 5 244 March 2021 and Delta reached 50 % on 30 June 2021 ( Fig 4E and 4F ) . With the conservative approach , 245 dominance was reached somewhat later , namely on 22 March 2021 and 9 July 2021 , respectively . 246 Compared to genomic monitoring data , the model lagged 28 to 45 days behind for Alpha and 3 to 12 247 days behind for Delta , respectively . This suggests that either the liberal approach better approximates 248 the true number of imported cases that resulted in subsequent transmission chains , that certain events 249 during the early phase of importation accelerated the growth of VoCs , or both . Stochastic simulations 250 of imported variants highlight that the expected variation in the early growth phase can shift the epidemic 251 trajectories by several weeks ( Sup Fig 3ABC ) . 252 253 254 255 .

Complete border closure for 100 days delayed 269 the time to dominance by around 40 days . The effect of closed borders is substantially reduced when 270 implemented after the international warning ( Fig 5B ) . Increased surveillance of travelers that reduces 271 the number of imported VoCs that result in a subsequent transmission chain by 25 % , 50 % , and 75 % 272 would delay the time to dominance of Alpha for 4 , 10 , and 19 days ( 95 % compatibility interval ( CI ) : 2 - 6 , 273 7 - 14 , and 13 - 28 days ) and of Delta for 3 , 6 , and 14 days ( 95 % CI : 2 - 5 , 5 - 10 , and 8 - 18 days ) ( Fig 5C ) . 274 275 276 Fig 5 : Counterfactual scenarios for mitigating the spread of VoCs in Switzerland .

In the phylogenetic analysis , we found that single importation events happened early and 285 at least several hundred Alpha ( 383 - 1 , 038 ) and Delta ( 455 - 1 , 347 ) cases were introduced into the Swiss 286 SARS - CoV - 2 epidemic during the study period . The integration of these importation events into a 287 transmission model accurately described the subsequent spread of VoCs . We estimated a 41 % and 288 56 % increased transmissibility of Alpha and Delta compared to previously circulating variants , which is 289 in the range of previously reported estimates ( 5 , 7 – 11 ) . Applying our transmission model using 290 counterfactual intervention scenarios showed that only very strict or existing control measures would 291 substantially delay the time to dominance of VoCs . In contrast , implementing border closures after 292 international warnings delayed the time to dominance of VoCs by a few days only . Increased 293 surveillance of travelers - which is less disruptive than border closures - could prove effective for 294 delaying the spread of VoCs in situations where their severity remains unclear . These findings have 295 important implications for informing intervention strategies in the case of newly emerging SARS - CoV - 2 296 VoCs and future pandemic preparedness . 297 298 The major strength of our study is the combination of phylogenetic analyses with a dynamic 299 transmission model . This not only allowed us to estimate the number of imports but also to investigate 300 counterfactual intervention scenarios . During the study period , SARS - CoV - 2 sequencing coverage in 301 Switzerland was relatively high with an average of 14 % of reported cases being sequenced . Our 302 phylogenetic approach to estimate imported variants is standardizable and thus applicable to other 303 countries with similar genomic surveillance and other emerging pathogens . 304 305 Our study also has a number of limitations . First , we used a deterministic transmission model for our 306 main analysis and ignored the potential effects of stochasticity during the importation and early growth 307 phase of VoCs . In the model , we assumed that all imported VoCs enter a deterministic growth trajectory . 308 In contrast , some imported VoCs might not result in continuous transmission chains and go extinct even 309 with R e > 1 . We showed that stochastic effects during importation and the early growth phase can cause 310 a variation in the time to dominance of several weeks . With the phylogenetic analysis we found 311 .

Second , we fixed the generation time for Alpha , Delta , and earlier circulating variants 313 to 5 . 2 days . There is some evidence that the generation time of Delta is somewhat shorter ( 44 ) , but we 314 do not expect this to affect our results substantially . Third , we did not consider the importation of other 315 variants that could compete with the new VoCs . Since the new VoCs were characterized by an 316 increased transmissibility , we do not expect this assumption to substantially affect the dynamics of the 317 new VoCs replacing previously circulating variants . Fourth , we did not consider co - infection with 318 different variants ( 45 ) . As we focus our analysis on the spread of VoCs and not on their evolution , we 319 do not expect this to affect our results substantially . Fifth , we assumed a constant ascertainment of 320 SARS - CoV - 2 infections of 50 % , which was informed by seroprevalence studies ( 38 , 39 ) . During the 321 study period , test positivity varied and ascertainment might have fluctuated as well . Thus , our 322 transmission model cannot precisely describe the overall number of infections , which was not the 323 objective of our study . In addition , the high variation in genomic sequencing among different countries 324 can influence the estimated number of imports from the phylogenetic analysis . Finally , the phylogenetic 325 analysis has intrinsic limitations due to the limited sequencing coverage , and interpretation during 326 outbreaks requires caution ( 2 , 46 ) . This is specifically true for Alpha , as sequencing in Switzerland was 327 scaled up considerably during 2021 . There is currently no gold standard for estimating imports . In our 328 analysis , we only considered one importation event per cluster , which could lead to an underestimation 329 of imports . To address this issue , we used two approaches to estimate lower and upper bounds on the 330 number of imports . The liberal approach considered any cluster containing Swiss sequences as an 331 importation event . If the sequencing coverage was low , the liberal approach would thus overestimate 332 imports and exports could cause Swiss sequences to be falsely classified as imports . In contrast , the 333 conservative approach considered only the earliest clusters with Swiss sequence as imports , which 334 means that further potential imports were strictly excluded . 335 336 For monitoring the transmission dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 , it is important to differentiate between 337 locally - acquired and imported infections , particularly in situations when the local incidence of infections 338 is low ( 13 ) . Based on routine surveillance data from FOPH , we previously extrapolated a total of 6 , 211 339 and 37 , 061 imported cases in Switzerland during summer 2020 and 2021 , respectively . Using genomic 340 data to estimate the number of imports might have the advantage of being less prone to the bias in 341 .

Other studies estimated the number of imported infections during the early 342 phase of the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic . For example , 13 and 101 introductions were estimated to South 343 Africa over two and eight months ( 27 , 47 ) , 120 introductions were estimated in Boston over three months 344 ( 23 ) , and more than 1 , 000 introductions were estimated to the UK over three months ( 6 ) . During summer 345 2020 , we estimated 34 to 291 introductions of the SARS - CoV - 2 variant EU1 to Switzerland over four 346 months ( 3 ) . 347 348 Global genomic surveillance is essential to monitor the emergence and spread of VoCs . As of February 349 2023 , more than 14 million SARS - CoV - 2 sequences have been submitted to GISAID ( 34 ) . This effort 350 facilitated the early identification of several VoCs , such as Omicron in November 2021 ( 47 ) . Early 351 detection of variants with substantial immune evasion or altered severity can inform policy makers to 352 adjust control measures , vaccination programs , and health systems . For example , several countries 353 imposed controversial travel bans for visitors from South Africa to prevent importation of Omicron ( 48 ) . 354 In our analysis , we found that complete border closures following warnings of VoCs have limited impact 355 and delay their spread by a couple of days only . Hence , travel bans and any time they may buy for 356 certain interventions , such as increasing the uptake of booster vaccines , have to be carefully balanced 357 against the societal and economic costs that accompany them . Similar to our findings , McCrone et al . 358 reported that control measures that had just been introduced in response to warnings about Delta were 359 late , as introductions have already occurred to other countries ( 25 ) . In addition to studying importation 360 and exportation events of VoCs , it is important to better understand the spread of VoCs in the local 361 context . Variations in naturally - acquired and vaccine elicited levels of immunity , local control measures , 362 mobility , and behavior can strongly influence the local spread of VoCs . Taking these factors into account 363 will be critical to inform country - specific strategies to respond to the emergence of new VoCs . 364 365 Integrating phylogenetic analyses with dynamic transmission models can provide critical insights into 366 the importation and early spread of SARS - CoV - 2 VoCs , and how they are impacted by different 367 intervention scenarios . In this study , we showed that border closures would have had a limited impact 368 on the spread of Alpha and Delta in Switzerland . In contrast , increased surveillance of travelers can 369 potentially delay the spread of VoCs by several weeks , which can buy time for health systems to prepare 370 for new epidemic waves . 371 .
