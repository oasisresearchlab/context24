Maternally transferred immunity may also be harnessed to target diseases asso - ciated with endogenous protein misfolding and aggregation , such as Alzheimer ’ s disease ( AD ) and AD - pathology in Down syndrome ( DS ) . While familial early - onset AD ( fEOAD ) is associated with autosomal dominant mutations in the APP , PSEN1 , 2 genes , promoting cere - bral Amyloid - β ( A β ) deposition , DS features a life - long overexpression of the APP and DYRK1A genes , leading to a cognitive decline mediated by A β overproduction and tau hyperphosphorylation . Although no prenatal screening for fEOAD - related mutations is in clinical practice , DS can be diagnosed in utero . We hypothesized that anti - A β MAbs might promote the removal of early A β accumulation in the central nervous system of human APP - expressing mice . To this end , a DNA - vaccine expressing A β 1 - 11 was delivered to wild - type female mice , followed by mating with 5xFAD males , which exhibit early A β plaque formation . MAbs reduce the offspring ’ s cortical A β levels 4 months after antibodies were undetectable , along with alleviating short - term memory de ﬁ cits . MAbs elicit a long - term shift in microglial phenotype in a mechanism involving activation of the Fc γ R1 / Syk / Co ﬁ lin pathway . These data suggest that maternal immunization can alleviate cognitive decline mediated by early A β deposition , as occurs in EOAD and DS . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 021 - 01851 - 6 OPEN 1 The Leslie and Susan Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center , Bar - Ilan University , Ramat Gan , Israel . 2 The Paul Feder Laboratory on Alzheimer ’ s disease research , Bar - Ilan University , Ramat Gan , Israel . 3 The Mina and Everard Goodman faculty of Life sciences , Bar - Ilan University , Ramat Gan , Israel . 4 Immunoregulation Section , Laboratory of Immunology and Molecular Biology , National Institute on Aging , Baltimore , MD , USA . ✉ email : eitan . okun @ biu . ac . il COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2021 ) 4 : 329 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 021 - 01851 - 6 | www . nature . com / commsbio 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 0 ( ) : , ; M aternal antibodies ( MAbs ) , transferred from the mother to the offspring , provide critical and effective protection against pathogens in the immunologically immature neonates 1 , 2 . Maternal IgG transplacental transfer to fetuses 3 and throughout breastfeeding in neonates 2 is mediated by Fc - receptor - neonatal ( FcRn ) IgG transport across the placental syncytiotrophoblasts 4 and through the intestinal epithelium 5 , 6 , respectively . Therefore , MAbs may be used to boost neonates ’ immunity by transferring antibodies ( Abs ) from vaccinated mothers to the offspring . Maternal vaccination can be adminis - tered during pregnancy against in ﬂ uenza infection , Tetanus tox - oid , reduced diphtheria toxoid , and acellular pertussis . Pneumococcal , Meningococcal , and hepatitis A and B vaccines may be given in pregnancy in speci ﬁ c populations . All the vac - cinations mentioned above can also be administered post - partum , during breastfeeding , or both 7 , 8 . Thus , in many countries , maternal vaccination is a routine procedure during pregnancy , post - partum , and breastfeeding . We , therefore , hypothesized that maternal immunity might also be harnessed to target diseases associated with early endo - genous protein misfolding and aggregation , such as familial early onset Alzheimer ’ s disease ( fEOAD ) and Alzheimer ’ s disease ( AD ) - related pathology in Down syndrome ( DS ) . In contrast to the more common late - onset AD ( LOAD ) , fEOAD is associated with autosomal dominant mutations in the Amyloid - precursor protein ( APP ) and Presenilin 1 and 2 ( PSEN1 , 2 ) genes 9 , 10 . EOAD commences before the age of 65 and is the most common cause of early onset neurodegenerative dementia 10 . EOAD and LOAD share common features , such as neuritic plaques and neuro ﬁ - brillary tangles , but differ in onset , severity , and localization of the pathology in the brain 9 , 10 . In an extreme and rare example , individuals carrying the very aggressive mutation L166P in PSEN1 that induces an exceptionally high increase of Amyloid - β ( A β ) - 42 production exhibit onset of AD in adolescence 11 . DS , caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 , is the most prevalent genetic cause for intellectual disability , affecting ~ 1 in every 750 live births 12 . The life expectancy of individuals with DS has risen sig - ni ﬁ cantly in the past several decades due to improved medical treatment of various comorbidities . Nevertheless , individuals with DS have a shortened life expectancy and accelerated aging compared to the general population 13 . DS shares common pathological symptoms with AD 14 , as individuals with DS experience AD - related cognitive decline in their fourth and ﬁ fth decades of their lives 14 , 15 . A signi ﬁ cant and widespread AD - related pathology precedes the cognitive decline , detected as early as at the age of 12 years 16 , which includes neuro ﬁ brillary tangles , A β angiopathy , extracellular A β and neuritic plaques 17 and microgliosis 18 – 20 . This is in part due to overexpression of the APP and DYRK1A genes , located on the tri - plicated chromosome 21 21 , although A β deposition is also promoted by non - APP mediated mechanisms 15 , 22 . In this respect , A β - related pathology in DS shows high similarity to EOAD 23 . Thus , A β pathology is etiologically and mechanistically shared between EOAD and DS 24 – 26 . While prenatal screening for fEOAD - related mutation is currently not in clinical practice , DS is typically diagnosed towards the end of the ﬁ rst trimester of the pregnancy . Therefore , individuals with DS , as do individuals with some adolescence - onset variants of fEOAD , such as the L166P in PSEN1 , may present unique groups that can bene ﬁ t from an early intervention directed at A β pathology . A β CoreS is a DNA vaccine coding A β 1 - 11 ( a B - cell epitope ) fused to a Hepatitis - B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) and a Hepatitis - B core antigen ( HBcAg ) , both contain multiple T - helper epitopes that help facilitate Ab production 27 . The A β CoreS construct was previously shown to delay cognitive decline and reduce human A β pathology in the 3xTg - AD mouse model of AD 27 . A modi ﬁ ed vaccine targeting murine A β , which is triplicated in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS 28 , was also shown to induce anti - A β Ab production that facilitates clearance of soluble oligomers and small extracellular inclusions of A β from the hippocampus and cortex of Ts65Dn mice 29 . Anti - A β Ab production was correlated with reduced neurodegeneration and restoration of the homeo - static phenotype of microglia and astrocytes in this strain 29 . These ﬁ ndings support the notion that immunotherapy against A β can slow the progression of dementia in DS and that an anti - murine A β vaccination is safe to use in mice , as vaccinated wild - type ( WT ) mice exhibited no cognitive or other behavioral abnormalities that could indicate neurotoxicity 29 . In the current study , we hypothesized that maternal vaccina - tion at the developmental and postnatal stages coupled with an active vaccination post - partum would yield a continuous immune coverage against A β , effectively targeting early neuropathology and dementia as occurs in fEOAD and DS . Mouse models of trisomy - 21 successfully recapitulate several aspects of DS , such as cholinergic neurodegeneration , elevated levels of A β and phospho - tau , and impaired cognitive ability 30 . However , these current DS models critically fail to recapitulate extracellular A β plaque accumulation 22 , 29 . Indeed , several DS models , including the Ts65Dn strain , overexpress murine A β , which does not aggregate as human A β ( hA β ) , potentially due to three amino - acids differences in the N - terminus . These differences have been reported to modulate the binding of metal ions , which can in ﬂ uence the ﬁ brillogenesis of A β peptides 31 . The replacement of His - 13 for Arg in rodent A β disrupts a metal coordination site , rendering the rodent peptide less prone to zinc - induced aggre - gation in vitro . Moreover , this region is essential for the speci ﬁ city of amyloid interactions 32 . Thus , mouse models that encompass triplication of murine APP exhibit elevated levels of APP protein and soluble A β but not plaque pathology . Humanized models of DS such as the Tc1 strain also lack plaque pathology due to a nonfunctional human APP gene 33 . Accordingly , these models lack plaque - associated microglial pathology 29 , 34 , 35 . These considerations led us to use the 5xFAD strain that encompasses ﬁ ve mutations associated with A β pathology in fEOAD 36 : the KM670 / 671NL ( Swedish ) , I716V ( Florida ) , and V717I ( London ) mutations in APP and the M146L , L286V mutations in PSEN1 . Herein , WT female mice were vaccinated against hA β 1 - 11 or a sham vaccine at 8w of age . Vaccinated females were then crossed with 5xFAD males to produce maternally vaccinated transgenic and WT offspring . Following weaning , transgenic offspring were actively vaccinated against A β 1 - 11 or sham . The offspring were then tested for cognitive capacity at 4 m and were sacri ﬁ ced for neuropathology assessment at 5 m . A β - speci ﬁ c antibodies from vaccinated mice directly affected the phagocytosis capacity of primary microglial cells in a Syk - dependent manner . Our ﬁ ndings provide evidence for a long - term effect of maternal vaccination on A β - related pathology , long after maternal Abs were not detectable in the offspring ’ s circulation . Results Maternal anti - A β antibodies are transferred to 5xFAD fetuses and newborns . Female C57BL / 6j mice ( 8w - old ) were immunized against A β 1 - 11 using the A β CoreS - DNA construct or HBsAg as control ( Fig . 1a ) . Vaccinated females produced a high anti - A β Ab titer compared with controls ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 1b ) . Both mouse groups generated anti - HBsAg titers . However , mice vaccinated with the HBsAg alone produced a higher titer than mice vacci - nated with A β CoreS that includes A β 1 - 11 and HBsAg domains ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 1c ) , possibly due to epitope competition . This is further indicated by a negative correlation of r = − 0 . 5 found between anti - A β and - HBsAg Ab levels ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 1d ) . The A β CoreS vaccine elicited high IgG1 , IgG2a , IgG2b , and IgM titers ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 021 - 01851 - 6 2 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2021 ) 4 : 329 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 021 - 01851 - 6 | www . nature . com / commsbio against A β ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 1e ) . HBsAg alone induced higher IgG1 levels ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 1f ) and higher IgG2b levels ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 1f ) compared with A β CoreS - vaccinated mice . Following vaccination , WT females were mated with 5xFAD males to produce hemizygous transgenic and WT offspring . For Abs analysis , circulating blood was taken from 5xFAD fetuses at E17 , P0 , P7 , P14 , P21 , P28 , P42 , and P56 . Maternal Anti - A β Abs crossed the placenta to the fetuses , as early as E17 , compared with controls ( P < 0 . 0001 Fig . 1g ) . Strikingly , these Abs crossed to a greater extent via lactation of the colostrum ( P0 ) and milk ( P7 - P21 ) . Ab levels gradually increased in vaccinated fetuses compared with controls , with the progression of breastfeeding reaching a peak at P14 ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 1g ) . Following weaning at P28 , Ab levels decreased to those of controls . At P42 , no Ab difference was observed between the two groups ( P = 0 . 12 , Fig . 1g ) . IgG2b was the most prevalent immunoglobulin ( Ig ) isotype to transfer via the placenta and lactation , peaking at P7 ( Fig . 1h ) . Active immunization of maternally vaccinated 5xFAD pups induces mostly anti - A β IgG2b Abs . We next assessed whether maternal vaccination is comparable to active vaccination at a young age . Prior to active vaccination , elevated levels of A β - speci ﬁ c IgG2b and IgM were found in maternally vaccinated pups compared with controls ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 2a ) . Normalizing the pups ’ isotype concentration to those of their dams revealed that Fig . 1 Maternally induced anti - A β antibodies cross the placenta and lactation into the circulation of 5xFAD fetuses and newborns . a Study design for dams ( upper timeline ) and pups ( bottom timeline ) .

A signi ﬁ cant positive correlation of r = 0 . 6 was found between dams ’ and pups ’ IgG2b levels ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 2c ) . Nor - malized IgM levels were also high in pup circulation , reaching 36 % of the mothers ’ concentration , higher than all other isotypes ( P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 2b ) . At 1 m of age , both groups of A β 1 - 11 and sham maternally vaccinated pups received either A β 1 - 11 or sham active vaccination , to create four experimental groups : No treatment ( M − / A − ) , maternal vaccination only ( M + / A − ) , active vaccination only ( M − / A + ) and combined maternal and active vaccination ( M + / A + ) . A control WT group was administered with the control vaccine only for behavioral and neuropathological baseline ( Fig . 1a ) . Blood Ab titers at 1 m re ﬂ ected maternal IgG , whereas Ab titers at 2 . 5 , 3 . 5 , and 5 m re ﬂ ected a humoral response to active vaccination . Following active vaccination , total IgG levels in the M − / A + and M + / A + groups dramatically increased compared with M − / A − , M + / A − , and WT groups ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 2d ) . The yield of active vaccination in the M + / A + group was 18 . 24 ± 4 . 09 - fold the concentration of maternal Abs and remained high at 5 m ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 2d ) . Exposure to maternal Abs in the M + / A − group was limited up to 1 m of age , following which Ab levels were undetectable ( Fig . 2d ) . In actively vaccinated offspring , IgG1 , IgG2a , and IgG3 levels were higher than control at 2 . 5 m ( P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 2e , f , g , respectively , summarized in Fig . 2j ) and decreased to baseline at later time - points . As expected , levels of IgG2b were elevated following vaccination and remained high until 5 m of age in the M − / A + and M + / A + groups compared with the M − / A − , M + / A − , and WT groups ( P < 0 . 001 , Fig . 2h , j ) . Accordingly , IgM levels were elevated following vaccination in actively vaccinated mice at 2 . 5 m ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 2i , j ) , which decreased to baseline at later time - points . Maternal and active vaccination rescue short - term memory abilities and normalizes exploratory behavior . To compare the effects of maternal and active vaccinations with that of A β on cognition , mice were tested in a battery of behavioral paradigms at 4 m of age ( Fig . 1a ) . Short - term memory capacity was assessed using the novel object recognition ( NOR ) test 37 . While WT , M − / A + , and M + / A + vaccinated 5xFAD mice exhibited a clear preference for the novel object throughout the experiment , unvaccinated mice showed no such preference after the ﬁ rst 20 s of the trial ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 3a 1 - 2 ) . M + / A − mice exhibited a preference to the novel object only during the ﬁ rst 60 s ( P < 0 . 01 compared with M − / A − , P < 0 . 0001 compared with M + / A + , Fig . 3a 1 - 2 ) , suggesting that maternal vaccination alone only par - tially ameliorated de ﬁ cits in short - term memory , while active vaccination and combined vaccination resulted in a full short - term memory restoration . M − / A − mice exhibited lower exploratory behavior in this task , as they spent less time near the familiar and novel objects together , compared with M + / A − ( P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 3a 2 , b ) . No difference was observed in the spontaneous - alternation T - maze for short - term memory assessment ( P = 0 . 51 , Fig . S1a ) . To rule out non - cognitive effects on short - term memory assessment , we also tested exploratory behavior . Similar to WT controls , M + / A + 5xFAD mice spent more time in the center of the open ﬁ eld ( OF ) arena 38 , compared with M − / A − , M + / A − , and M − / A + vaccinated 5xFAD mice ( P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 3c 1 - 2 ) . Exploration speed and distance did not differ between groups ( P = 0 . 61 , P = 0 . 59 , respectively , Fig . S1b - c ) . These results imply that a combination of maternal and active vaccination completely normalized exploratory behavior in 4m - old 5xFAD mice . To rule out anxiety - related confounds , mice were tested in the elevated zero - maze ( EZM ) 39 . The fraction of time spent in the open / close zones of the maze did not differ between groups ( P = 0 . 96 , Fig . S1d ) , suggesting no effect on anxiety - related behavior . However , the number of entries to the anxiogenic open section of the EZM was lower among M − / A − mice compared with M + / A − ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 3d 1 - 2 ) . Exploration distance and speed did not differ between groups ( P = 0 . 15 , P = 0 . 15 , respectively , Fig . S1e , f ) . These ﬁ ndings suggest that while no anxiety - like behavior is found , maternal and active vaccinations enhance exploratory behavior among 5xFAD mice in the EZM . Maternal vaccination reduces cerebral A β levels in adult 5xFAD mice . Mice were sacri ﬁ ced at 5 m to assess A β - related neuropathology ( Fig . 1a ) . Cortical A β 40 and A β 42 levels were quanti ﬁ ed using a modi ﬁ ed sELISA protocol 40 in soluble ( TBST - soluble ) , pre - amyloid complexes ( SDS - soluble ) , and insoluble - ﬁ brillary ( FA - soluble ) A β extracts . M + / A − and M + / A + mice exhibited reduced soluble A β 42 compared with both M − / A − and M − / A + mice ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 4a ) . No difference was observed between M − / A − and M − / A + groups ( P = 0 . 16 , Fig . 4a ) , although M − / A − was the only group to have elevated levels of soluble A β 42 compared with WT controls ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 4a ) . SDS - soluble pre - amyloid A β 42 was reduced in M + / A − and M − / A + but not in M + / A + treated mice compared with M − / A − , ( P < 0 . 01 , P = 0 . 21 , respectively , Fig . 4b ) . However , M − / A − mice were the only group to have elevated levels of SDS - soluble A β 42 compared with WT controls ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 4b ) . Importantly , insoluble A β 42 was reduced in maternally vaccinated mice ( M + / A − and M + / A + ) , compared with unvaccinated and actively vaccinated mice ( M − / A − and M − / A + ) ( P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 4c ) . No difference was observed in cortical insoluble A β 42 between M − / A − and M − / A + ( P = 0 . 68 , Fig . 4c ) or between M + / A − and M + / A + ( P = 0 . 97 , Fig . 4c ) . Elevated levels of insoluble A β 42 were observed in M − / A − and M − / A + compared with WT controls ( P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 4c ) . These ﬁ ndings suggest that active vaccination alone is insuf ﬁ cient in reducing insoluble A β 42 . Moreover , active vaccination did not yield additional reduction in already maternally immunized mice , suggesting that early passive maternal vaccination results in a long - lasting effect on either A β accumulation , clearance , or both . Maternally vaccinated mice ( M + / A − and M + / A + ) exhibited reduced soluble A β 40 compared with M − / A − and M − / A + mice ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 4d ) . M − / A + mice exhibited a non - signi ﬁ cant reduction in soluble A β 40 compared with M − / A − mice ( P = 0 . 22 , Fig . 4d ) . However , M − / A − was the only group in which soluble A β 40 was signi ﬁ cantly higher than WT controls ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 4d ) . In the SDS - soluble fraction , A β 40 was lower in M − / A + , M + / A − and M + / A + vaccination groups compared with unvaccinated mice ( P < 0 . 01 , P < 0 . 01 , P < 0 . 05 , respectively , Fig . 4e ) . Elevated levels of SDS - soluble A β 40 were measured in M − / A − mice compared with WT controls ( P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 4e ) . While M − / A − mice exhibited elevated levels of insoluble A β 40 compared with WT controls ( P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 4f ) , no difference was observed between 5xFAD groups ( P = 0 . 13 , Fig . 4f ) . Insoluble A β 42 / A β 40 ratio 41 was signi ﬁ cantly higher in M − / A − mice compared with WT controls ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 4g ) , with no difference from all other 5xFAD groups ( P = 0 . 13 , main effect maternal vaccination , P = 0 . 16 , main effect active vaccination , Fig . 4g ) . To test whether the reduction in cerebral A β among maternally vaccinated mice is a result of enhanced clearance or reduced production of A β , hAPP levels were measured at the transcript and protein levels . hAPP mRNA did not differ for both maternal ( P = 0 . 42 ) and active ( P = 0 . 35 ) vaccinations ( Supplementary Fig . S2a ) , suggesting that reduced APP production cannot explain the observed reduction in A β . At the protein level , actively and COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 021 - 01851 - 6 ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2021 ) 4 : 329 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 021 - 01851 - 6 | www . nature . com / commsbio 5 combined vaccinated mice exhibited a reduction in hAPP compared with untreated and maternally vaccinated mice ( P < 0 . 05 , supplementary Fig . S2b ) . This effect accounts for only ~ 18 % of the ﬁ nal reduction seen in cerebral A β levels and is possibly due to the neutralization of hAPP by antibodies . These results suggest that most of the observed reduction in A β is not due to lowered hAPP expression and is , therefore , attributable to A β clearance . Maternal anti - A β IgG levels in offspring circulation negatively correlated with insoluble A β 42 levels at 5 m of age ( r = − 0 . 43 , P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 4h , S3a ) , whereas active vaccination showed no such correlation ( r = − 0 . 11 , P = 0 . 32 , Fig . 4h , S3d ) . Similar correlations were found for maternal IgG2b and IgM levels Fig . 3 Combination of maternal and active vaccination rescues short - term memory abilities and normalizes exploratory behavior .

A limited - time exposure of offspring to MAbs resulted in a long - lasting effect on A β pathology and short - term memory restoration , months after MAbs were not detected in the circu - lation . As A β was not targeted by MAbs later than 1 m of age , two mechanisms could be ruled out : ( a ) maternal Abs interfere with A β oligomerization and ﬁ brillation , to prevent plaque forma - tion 42 , and ( b ) maternal vaccination facilitates A β clearance by microglia via opsonization 43 . This led us to hypothesize that maternal vaccination promoted a long - lasting microglial phago - cytic phenotype , independently of the presence of anti - A β Abs . To verify this , we assessed the expression of various Fc receptors in the brain at 1 m following maternal vaccination only , and at 5 m of age , following maternal and active vaccination . The acti - vating Fc γ RI , Fc γ RIII , and Fc γ RIV initiate Fc - mediated phago - cytosis via several actin - regulating pathways 44 , 45 . Additionally , FcRn is crucial for the transport of maternal Abs from the pla - centa and gut to the circulation of fetuses and newborns 46 . At 1 m , cerebral Fc γ RI levels were elevated in maternally vaccinated WT and 5xFAD mice compared with sham - vaccinated controls ( P < 0 . 05 , P < 0 . 001 , respectively , Fig . 5a ) . Interestingly , Fc γ RIII levels increased in maternally vaccinated 5xFAD mice compared with controls ( P < 0 . 001 , Fig . 5b ) , but not among vaccinated WT mice compared with WT controls ( P = 0 . 12 , Fig . 5b ) . A similar strain - speci ﬁ c effect was also observed for Fc γ RIV expression in the brain ( P = 0 . 07 for WT , P < 0 . 0001 for 5xFAD , Fig . 5c ) . FcRn levels were elevated in both WT and 5xFAD mice compared with controls ( P < 0 . 01 for WT , P < 0 . 01 for 5xFAD , Fig . 5d ) . Inter - estingly , levels of the inhibitory Fc γ RIIb were elevated in vacci - nated 5xFAD mice compared with controls ( P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 5e ) , but not in vaccinated WT mice ( P = 0 . 18 , Fig . 5e ) . These results indicate that the presence of MAbs correlates with transcript upregulation of their receptors in the brain . At 5 m , Fc γ RI levels in M + / A − , M − / A + , and M + / A + mice were elevated compared with M − / A − mice ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 5f ) . No difference was observed between M + / A − and M + / A + mice , implying the absence of additional contribution of active vaccination to Fc γ RI upregula - tion in already maternally vaccinated mice . Fc γ RIII mRNA levels were higher in M + / A − and M − / A + mice compared with unvaccinated mice ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 5g ) . However , combined maternal and active vaccination M + / A + did not differ sig - ni ﬁ cantly from unvaccinated mice ( P = 0 . 07 , Fig . 5g ) . Fc γ RIV transcript levels did not differ between groups ( P = 0 . 27 , the main effect for maternal vaccination , P = 0 . 47 , main effect for active vaccination , Fig . 5h ) . FcRn levels in M + / A − , M + / A + , and M + / A + mice were elevated compared with M − / A − mice ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 5i ) . Levels of inhibitory Fc γ RIIb were elevated in M + / A − and M − / A + compared with M − / A − ( P < 0 . 05 , P < 0 . 01 , respectively , Fig . 5j ) . Importantly , Fc γ RIIb levels were reduced in M + / A + compared with M − / A + mice ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 5j ) , suggesting that the combined vaccination results in upregulation of activator FcRs and downregulation of inhibitory FcRs . In addition , elevation in Fc γ RI , Fc γ RIII , and FcRn strongly correlated with A β reduction ( full data are described in the supplementary note , Fig . S4a – c , e ) . Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells - 2 ( TREM2 ) , an innate immune receptor expressed on microglia , is heavily implicated in microglial recruitment to A β plaques 47 – 49 . DNAX - activating protein of 12 kDa ( DAP12 ; also known as TYROBP ) associates with TREM2 and is essential for its function in signal transduction following ligand binding 50 , 51 . Intriguingly , 1m - old maternally vaccinated WT and 5xFAD mice exhibited high expression of TYROBP compared with controls ( P < 0 . 01 , Supplementary Fig . S4g ) . TYROBP expression remained elevated months after maternal vaccination , as its expression in M + / A − mice was higher compared with M − / A − mice ( P < 0 . 05 , Supplementary Fig . S4h ) . M − / A + and M + / A + exhibited a non - signi ﬁ cant elevation in TYROBP expression at 5 m of age compared with controls ( Supplementary Fig . S4h ) . This suggests that in addition to upregulating Fc γ R , maternal vaccination also enhances the expression of TYROBP in a long - lasting manner , which supports TREM2 signaling in microglia . Maternal vaccination elevates Fc γ RI on microglial cells . As Fc γ R signaling could mediate the effects of maternal vaccination on A β pathology , we next assessed Fc γ RI , Fc γ RIIb , Fc γ RIII , and Fc γ RIV expression in CNS cells . Fc γ RI was abundantly expressed in microglia , but not in neurons or astrocytes ( full data are described in the supplementary note , Figs . S5 – 6 ) . Consequently , we assessed Fc γ RI levels in microglial cells in the hippocampus and cortex of maternally and actively immunized mice . At 5 m , hippocampal Fc γ RI levels were elevated in M + / A − and M + / A + microglia compared with both M − / A − and M − / A + ( P < 0 . 05 , P < 0 . 01 , respectively , Fig . 6a - b ) . Active vaccination alone did not yield such elevation compared with M − / A − ( P = 0 . 84 , Fig . 6a , b ) . Fc γ RI expression was normally distributed in M + / A + microglia ( P = 0 . 7 compared with the simulated normal distribution of the same mean and standard deviation , Fig . 6c ) and close to the normal distribution in M + / A − ( P = 0 . 04 , Fig . 6c ) . In M − / A − and M − / A + , Fc γ RI distribution was skewed to the right and signi ﬁ cantly differed from the simulated normal distribution ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 6c ) . Fc γ RI distribution in M + / A − and M + / A + hippocampal microglia differed from M − / A − and M − / A + ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 6d ) , with no difference between M + / A − and M + / A + mice , suggesting no additive effect of active vaccination on already maternally immunized animals . Similar effects were found in cortical microglia , as Fc γ RI levels were elevated in M + / A − and M + / A + mice , compared with controls ( full data are described in the supplementary note , Fig . S7 ) . Maternal vaccination activates phagocytosis - related signaling cascades in microglial cells . Maternal vaccination upregulated Fc γ RI , Fc γ RIII , Fc γ RIV , and FcRn transcripts ( Fig . 5a – j ) and increased microglial Fc γ RI protein expression ( Fig . 6a – d ) . Clus - tering of Fc γ Rs induces activation of Src - related kinases that phosphorylate the immunoreceptor tyrosine - based activation motif ( ITAM ) domain on Fc γ Rs . Syk is recruited to the receptor and undergoes autophosphorylation . This in turn activates downstream signaling molecules , such as AKT , ERK , and co ﬁ lin , all involved in actin - cytoskeleton regulation and are essential for phagocytosis 52 . At 5 m of age , pSyk was upregulated in the hippocampus of M + / A − and M + / A + compared with M − / A − and M − / A + mice ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 7a , b ) . Similarly , total Syk was also upregulated in maternally vaccinated mice ( P < 0 . 001 , Fig . 7a - b ) , suggesting that Fc γ R upregulation by maternal vaccination resulted in activation of downstream Syk signaling . pAKT levels were elevated as a result of active vaccination in M − / A + and M + / A + compared with M − / A − and M + / A − , with no effect of maternal vaccination ( P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 7a , c ) . Total AKT levels did not differ between groups ( P = 0 . 9 , main effect for active vaccination , 0 . 76 , main effect for maternal vaccination , Fig . 7a , c ) . In a similar manner , pERK levels increased in actively vaccinated mice M − / A + and M + / A + compared with ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 021 - 01851 - 6 8 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2021 ) 4 : 329 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 021 - 01851 - 6 | www . nature . com / commsbio M − / A − and M + / A − , with little contribution of maternal vaccination ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 7a , d ) . Total ERK levels did not differ between groups ( P = 0 . 98 , main effect for active vaccination , 0 . 54 , main effect for maternal vaccination , Fig . 7a , d ) . This may serve as evidence for Syk activation of ERK and AKT - mediated actin regulation as a result of active , but not maternal , vaccination . pCo ﬁ lin levels increased in maternally immunized mice M + / A − , compared with unvaccinated mice M − / A − ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 7a , e ) . No difference was observed between actively M − / A + and combined M + / A + vaccination ( P = 0 . 87 , Fig . 7a , e ) . Moreover , Fig . 5 Maternal vaccination induces long - term FcRs upregulation in the brain .

Levels of co ﬁ lin were reduced in actively M − / A + and combined M + / A + mice compared with unvaccinated M − / A − and maternally vaccinated M − / A + mice ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 7a , e ) . This may serve as evidence that maternal vaccination enhances actin polymerization via Syk - mediated elevation in pCo ﬁ lin levels and reduction in Co ﬁ lin levels . Finally , we found that both maternal , M + / A − and M + / A + , and active M − / A + vaccination reduce actin levels compared with unvaccinated M − / A − mice ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 7a , f ) . These ﬁ ndings provide evidence for maternal vaccination ’ s long - term effect in facilitating FcR - mediated phagocytosis signaling pathways ( Fig . 7g ) . Maternal vaccination facilitates long - term A β clearance via enhancing FcR - mediated microglial phagocytosis . FcR upre - gulation led to the recruitment and activation of Syk , which in turn initiated an actin - regulating pathway via AKT , ERK , and Co ﬁ lin . Regulation of actin polymerization and depolymerization is essential for the construction of the phagosome 44 . CD68 , a lysosomal protein expressed in macrophages and activated microglia , is often associated with pro - in ﬂ ammatory disease - associated microglia . To assess whether maternally and actively vaccinated mice exhibit elevated phagocytic behavior , immuno - ﬂ uorescence ( IF ) analysis of CD68 among hippocampal Iba1 + cells was conducted . Maternally vaccinated mice M + / A − exhibit elevated CD68 levels in Iba1 + cells , compared with M − / A − Fig . 6 Maternal vaccination upregulates microglial FcRs expression . Microglial Fc γ RI protein expression was quanti ﬁ ed using immuno ﬂ uorescence following maternal and active vaccination at 5 m of age ( n = 5 ) . a Fc γ RI expression was assessed using double - labeled immuno ﬂ uorescence in Iba1 + microglia , using the x10 and x63 objectives for visualizing and quanti ﬁ cation , respectively . b Quanti ﬁ cation of Fc γ RI signal intensity among microglia . c Scatter plot and intensity distribution Fc γ RI signals in Iba1 + cells . d Overlay and comparisons of Fc γ RI expression distribution . * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * * P < 0 . 0001 , two - way ANOVA , corrected two - sample Kolmogorov – Smirnov test , data are presented as mean ± SEM .

Moreover , M − / A + and M + / A + mice exhibit higher CD68 expression than M − / A − and M + / A − mice ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 8a , b ) , with no difference between M − / A + and M + / A + ( P = 0 . 75 , Fig . 8a , b ) . These ﬁ ndings suggest that maternal vaccination alone enhances microglial phagocytosis . Rami ﬁ ed microglia were also observed in the hippocampi of naïve , maternally , and actively vaccinated mice ( Supplementary Fig . S8a ) . At the transcript level , M + / A − mice exhibit elevated levels of CD68 mRNA compared with M − / A − ( P < 0 . 001 , Fig . 8c ) , suggesting that maternal vaccination support microglial phagocytosis even in the absence of MAbs , possibly via FcR - Syk activation . Additionally , actively vaccinated M − / A + and com - bined M + / A + vaccination mice also exhibit elevated transcript levels of CD68 compared with unvaccinated controls ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 7 Maternal vaccination activates actin - cytoskeleton regulation pathways via Syk , AKT , ERK , and Co ﬁ lin phosphorylation .

These data imply that microglial phagocytosis is enhanced in maternally and actively vaccinated mice . To support the maternal vaccination / FcR / Syk / phagocytosis hypothesis , we stained hippocampal CD68 + cells for pSyk . Maternally vaccinated M + / A − mice exhibited elevated pSyk levels among CD68 + cells in the hippocampus , compared with M − / A − mice ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . S9a , b ) , suggesting that maternal vaccination alone is suf ﬁ cient in inducing Syk activation in microglial cells , long after maternally induced Abs are abolished . Additionally , maternally and actively M + / A + mice exhibited elevated microglial pSyk levels compared with actively M − / A + immunized mice ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . S9a , b ) , suggesting that active vaccination alone does not induce Syk activation as strongly as maternal vaccination . MAbs facilitate A β clearance by microglial cells in a Syk - dependent manner . We next assessed the effect of MAbs on Syk - dependent phagocytic capacity of N9 murine embryonic microglial cell - line 53 and adult primary microglia . Increasing concentration ( 0 . 75 – 5 µM ) of BAY - 61 - 3606 ( BAY ) , a highly selective Syk inhibitor 54 in the media of N9 cells reduced A β - induced Syk phosphorylation in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 9a ) . Accordingly , alteration in downstream signaling mole - cules of the Fc - mediate phagocytosis pathway was observed , namely , a reduction in ERK and AKT phosphorylation and an increase in co ﬁ lin phosphorylation ( Supplementary Fig . S10a , c ) . As activation of ERK and AKT exhibited a considerable reduction in cells incubated with 5 µM of BAY , the following experiments were conducted using this concentration . We ﬁ rst assessed the general capacity of N9 cells to perform phagocytosis of FBS - coated ﬂ uorescent beads following a 3 h FBS deprivation . N9 cells treated with BAY exhibited reduced phagocytic activity compared with controls ( P < 0 . 001 , Fig . 9b , c ) and a reduction in FITC intensity ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 9d ) , re ﬂ ecting not only a lower percentage of phagocytic cells but also a lower number of intracellular beads . Importantly , Syk inhibition reduced phagocytosis of A β 42 peptide , as the number of A β foci per mm 2 was reduced by ~ 50 % fol - lowing BAY administration compared to naïve cells ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 9e , f ) . Next , we tested whether pre - incubation of A β with serum from anti - A β vaccinated dams facilitates phagocytosis of Ab – Ag complexes . N9 cells were treated with A β 42 alone , A β 42 pre - incubated with serum from sham , or anti - A β vaccinated dams with and without BAY . 5 . 1 % of untreated N9 cells were A β positive , demonstrating baseline phagocytosis capacity of these cells ( Fig . 9g , h ) . Incubation with serum from sham - vaccinated resulted in 11 . 7 ± 0 . 03 % of phagocytic cells ( P < 0 . 0001 compared to baseline , Fig . 9g , h ) , and incubation with serum from anti - A β vaccinated dams elicited phagocytosis in 81 ± 0 . 003 % of the cells Fig . 8 Maternal vaccination enhances microglial phagocytosis .

COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 021 - 01851 - 6 ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2021 ) 4 : 329 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 021 - 01851 - 6 | www . nature . com / commsbio 13 ( P < 0 . 0001 compared with baseline and sham - vaccinated serum , Fig . 9g , h ) . Importantly , this drastic effect was abrogated by Syk inhibition , as only 18 . 3 ± 0 . 003 % of BAY and serum - treated cells were phagocytic ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 9g , h ) . The median of FITC intensity increased among cells treated with anti - A β serum compared with sham - vaccinated serum ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 9i , j ) and reduced following treatment with BAY ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 9i , j ) . These results demonstrate that MAbs facilitate Fc - receptor mediated A β phagocytosis in a Syk - dependent pathway . To fur - ther understand the alteration in cellular signaling following serum and A β administration , Syk phosphorylation was mea - sured using western blotting 10 – 30 min after treatment with either A β 42 alone , serum from anti - A β vaccinated dams , or A β 42 pre - incubated with serum from vaccinated and sham - vaccinated dams ( Fig . 9k ) . A β alone elicited elevation in Syk activation ( 3 . 75 - fold change of naïve cells after 20 min , Fig . 9k ) . Serum from anti - A β vaccinated dams alone also resulted in Syk activation ( 4 . 06 - fold change of naïve cells after 10 min , Fig . 9k ) . The difference in Syk activation timing implies that A β and antibodies alone may activate different signaling pathways , e . g . Fc - receptor signaling by antibodies and TREM2 signaling by A β , both of which are Syk - dependent . Interestingly , serum from sham - vaccinated dams eli - cited a milder activation of Syk ( 1 . 92 - fold change of naïve cells after 10 min , Fig . 9k ) , supporting our hypothesis that Syk phos - phorylation associated with Fc receptors peaks 10 min following treatment . Treatment with both A β and serum from vaccinated dams yielded a strong but transient Syk activation ( 4 . 16 - fold change of naïve cells after 20 min , Fig . 9k ) , suggesting that Ab – Ag complexes generate a somewhat different effect than Ab or Ag alone . To further examine the contribution of MAbs to Fc - receptor Syk - mediated A β clearance by microglia , a phagocytosis assay was conducted in adult primary microglia from naïve WT mice . Cells were administered with A β 42 ( 750 nM ) following incubation with serum from sham - vaccinated dams , anti - A β vaccinated dams , and Syk inhibitor BAY . 4 h following A β administration , primary microglial cells were ﬁ xed and stained for CD68 and intracellular A β . Treatment with serum from sham - vaccinated females did not increase A β phagocytosis compared with untreated cells ( P = 0 . 37 , Fig . 10a , b ) . In contrast , treatment with anti - A β serum increased phagocytic activity compared with both untreated and sham - vaccinated serum treatment ( P < 0 . 001 , Fig . 10a , b ) . Importantly , this effect was abrogated by Syk inhibition ( P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 10a , b ) , demonstrating that A β clearance facilitated by antibodies is a Syk - dependent process . Discussion To date , there is no effective therapy for AD nor AD - related neuropathology and dementia in DS . Considering the positive outcomes of active vaccination in 3xTg - AD and Ts65Dn mouse models of fEOAD and DS 27 , 29 and the rapid propagation of cerebral A β in these conditions , maternal vaccination may serve as an early , preventative intervention , well before the formation of A β plaques . So far , anti - A β vaccination targeting dementia in AD patients has failed to translate to the clinic . However , the age of intervention in relation to the onset of the disease and the sub - jects ’ immunological age might be held responsible 55 – 57 . The DS case is , therefore , quite different in this manner . DS is detectable in utero , and the progression of A β pathology is earlier and faster in DS than in late - onset AD . We thus propose that early anti - A β intervention in the form of maternally transferred Abs , along with active postnatal vaccination , may provide continuous immune targeting of A β in individuals with DS . Moreover , should prenatal testing for fEOAD - related mutations eventually translate to the clinic as a diagnostic tool , the maternal vaccination strategy may also bene ﬁ t individuals prone to early A β deposition , such as individuals carrying the L166P mutation in PSEN1 , who exhibit disease onset at adolescence 11 . In this study , we vaccinated WT females prior to their preg - nancy with transgenic embryos , as the duration of mature IgG production exceeds the length of pregnancy in mice . In humans , full humoral response can be achieved during pregnancy . In contrast to the full A β 42 , using the 1 - 11 fragment of A β , which does not contain cytotoxic T - cell epitopes , reduces the risk of a hazardous response 27 . Moreover , WT mice that received anti - A β 1 - 11 vaccine did not exhibit any behavioral or cognitive decline , neuronal loss , or in ﬂ ammatory response compared with con - trols 29 . To date , more than 50 clinical trials have been conducted using DNA delivery by electroporation , reporting enhancement of DNA immunogenicity in humans and tolerability by experi - mental animal and human subjects without causing substantial negative side effects 58 , 59 . The transfer of IgG2b Abs from dams to pups is supported by elevation of FcRn expression , which facilitates the passage of maternal Abs through the placenta and the crossing of maternal Abs from the gut of newborns into the circulation 46 . Moreover , FcRn plays a role in elongating IgG half - live as it restores opso - nized IgG and prevents its degradation . Maternal vaccination thus initiates a positive regulation loop in which the presence of MAbs elevates the transcription of FcRn , which in turn supports the passage of these Abs through the placenta and lactation and elongates their half - live and functionality . Among the MAbs milieu , IgG2b was the most common isotype that crossed the placenta . IgG2b and IgM were the most common isotypes delivered through lactation . Since IgM cannot cross the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) 60 , IgG2b is the main candidate effector for any downstream immunomodulation inside the CNS . Accord - ingly , we found elevated levels of Fc γ RI and Fc γ RIII , which bind IgG2b 45 , but no expression of cerebral Fc α / μ R that binds IgA and IgM . The positive correlation between maternal and newborns IgG2b levels along with the negative correlation between IgG2b levels in newborns and their A β levels at 5 m strongly support this suggestion . Indeed , we found that high maternal IgM levels in newborns were correlated with low A β pathology at 5 m . The contribution of IgM , if exists , is thus attributed to peripheral rather than CNS immunomodulation . Following active vaccina - tion , IgG2b was the only isotype to remain high three months after the last boost . Taken together , IgG2b remains the main effector of both maternal and active vaccination . We hypothesized that a combination of maternal and active vaccination would yield continuous protection from A β neuro - toxicity . Indeed , this combination resulted in normalization of exploratory behavior and restoration of short - term memory capacity . Intriguingly , maternal vaccination alone had no effect on exploratory behavior and only a partial positive effect on short - term memory . In contrast , active vaccination yielded a full rescue of short - term memory ability . Reduction in A β levels , however , was strongly dependent on maternal vaccination . Active vaccination produced a minor reduction in insoluble A β levels , whereas maternal vaccination , with or without the addition of active vaccination , greatly reduced levels of this fraction . More - over , MAbs concentration in the newborns ’ serum was sig - ni ﬁ cantly more predictive of A β clearance than actively induced - Abs in young adult mice . Taken together , the cognitive and neuropathological ﬁ ndings indicate that the combination of maternal and active vaccination produced the most potent ther - apeutic effect . MAbs were present in the offspring ’ s circulating blood for the short and limited period of pregnancy and lactation . Following weaning , these Abs were no longer detectable . However , four months after Abs were absent , A β levels were dramatically ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 021 - 01851 - 6 14 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2021 ) 4 : 329 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 021 - 01851 - 6 | www . nature . com / commsbio reduced , implying a long - lasting immunomodulatory effect on microglial cells . Maternal vaccination indeed increased the expression of effector Fc γ Rs and FcRn in the brain . Notably , the expression levels of Fc receptors negatively correlated with inso - luble A β levels . Fc receptors , expressed on various immune cells , constitute critical elements for activating or downregulating immune responses 61 . Our data suggest that an increase in FcR ligands upregulates the expression of Fc γ RI , Fc γ RIII , and Fc γ RIV at the transcript level in the brain , and Fc γ RI at the protein level in microglial cells . The effector Fc γ RI contains an intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine - based activation motif ( ITAM ) domain , which mediates cellular activation triggered by Ab - receptor binding 61 . Clustering of Fc γ Rs induces activation of Src family kinases that phosphorylates the ITAM domain within the receptor . When an effector FcR is activated , Syk is recruited to the receptor and undergoes autophosphorylation , resulting in acti - vation of downstream signaling molecules , such as AKT , ERK , and co ﬁ lin , all involved in actin - cytoskeleton regulation and are essential for phagocytosis 52 . The Fc γ Rs - Syk pathway is heavily implicated in phagocytosis 62 , 63 , a central function of microglial cells in the context of targeting amyloid burden 35 . Indeed , we found that Syk was activated in maternally vaccinated mice . Accordingly , levels of phospho - co ﬁ lin were increased , and levels of co ﬁ lin decreased . The actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / co ﬁ lin protein family consists of small actin - binding proteins that play central roles in accelerating actin turnover by disassembling actin ﬁ laments 64 . The activity of co ﬁ lin is regulated by phos - phorylation on residue Ser3 by LIM kinases ( LIMK1 and LIMK2 ) and TES kinases ( TESK1 and TESK2 ) , which inhibit its interac - tion with actin 65 . Thus , maternal vaccination - induced FcR - Syk mediated co ﬁ lin phosphorylation contributes to the inactivation of co ﬁ lin and promotes actin polymerization , which is essential for phagosome formation in microglia 44 . ERK and AKT activa - tion is also implicated in Fc - mediated phagocytosis , as both molecules undergo phosphorylation under Syk activation . Inhi - bition of Src and Syk kinases suppresses phagocytosis in primary human microglia , suppressing ERK and AKT activity 62 . Follow - ing the onset of A β propagation , ERK and AKT activation increased in actively , but not maternally , vaccinated mice . CD68 is a heavily glycosylated type I transmembrane glyco - protein , mainly associated with endosomal / lysosomal compart - ments 66 . In the brain , it is highly expressed in phagocytic microglia 67 . In accordance with previous results , maternally vaccinated mice express higher levels of microglial CD68 , sug - gesting enhanced phagocytic activity . In addition to Fc γ R - Syk axis activation in microglia , we found that maternal vaccination upregulates the expression of TYROBP , a signaling adapter pro - tein essential for TREM2 signaling in microglia 50 , 51 . We speculate Fig . 10 Maternal antibodies mediate A β phagocytosis by primary adult microglia in a Syk - dependent manner . A β phagocytosis capacity of adult primary microglia was assessed following treatment with either A β 42 alone or A β 42 pre - incubated with serum from anti - A β or sham - vaccinated dams . The contribution of Syk signaling was assessed using Syk inhibition by BAY - 61 - 3606 . a Immuno ﬂ uorescence images and ( b ) quanti ﬁ cation of A β phagocytosis by adult primary microglia reveal that serum from anti - A β vaccinated dams facilitates A β clearance in a Syk - dependent pathway . * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 , Chi - squared test for independence , Fisher ’ s exact test , data are presented as mean ± SEM . COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 021 - 01851 - 6 ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2021 ) 4 : 329 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 021 - 01851 - 6 | www . nature . com / commsbio 15 that TREM2 - mediated microglial activation is a secondary and complementary event , initiated following Fc γ R - upregulation , as FcRs , rather than TREM2 , are the primary receptor family for IgG antibodies . Moreover , TREM2 is required for the full pha - gocytic capacity of antibody – A β complexes ( a process mediated by FcR for phagocytosis ) by the N9 mouse microglial cell line and primary microglia , showing that TREM2 enables the phagocytic functions of other receptors 68 . In line with these data , we found that N9 and primary microglia phagocytosis of A β is dramatically increased in the presence of anti - A β antibodies obtained from vaccinated dams . This effect is antibody - speci ﬁ c , as serum from sham - vaccinated dams ( containing high titers of anti - HBSAg Abs ) did not yield an equivalent increase . Importantly , antibody - mediated phagocytosis is a Syk - dependent process , as inhibition of Syk abrogated phagocytic increases by Abs in both N9 and primary cells . Taken together , the association of A β clearance with microglial Syk activation maternal vaccination in vivo , and the establishment of causal relations between MAbs and phago - cytosis capacity in vitro serve as evidence for the modulatory effect of MAbs on microglial cellular function in eliminating A β from the brain parenchyma . We thus propose that during a short and limited period , maternal vaccination had set the infrastructure for facilitating future phagocytosis and clearance of A β by microglia . Such infrastructure consists of upregulation of effector Fc γ R in the brain . This Abs - induced process is supported by a positive reg - ulation loop of Abs - FcRn that facilitates Ab delivery via the placenta and lactation and increases Abs functionality . Upon A β - expression , this infrastructure facilitates Fc - mediated phagocy - tosis and A β clearance , without the addition of active vaccination . Of note , the 5xFAD mouse model of EOAD used here does not provide a good model for DS in terms of construct validity , due to several reasons : ( a ) the model is based on APP and PSEN1 mutations rather than on APP triplication , ( b ) the 5xFAD model lacks triplication of non - APP Hsa21 genes , and ( c ) the mutations in PSEN1 , which is not characteristic of DS , may result in a confounding effect . Furthermore , the 5xFAD lacks tau - related mutations , and resultantly , no tau hyperphosphorylation and NFT formation occur in this model . Nonetheless , its face validity in recapitulating early A β plaque pathology , as occurs in DS , is satisfactory at the phenotype level compared with other DS mouse models . To test the translatability of maternal vaccination to clinical trials , this approach needs to be tested in mouse models encompassing trisomy of Hsa21 - orthologous genes , including human APP . In this study , we tested the ef ﬁ cacy of maternal vaccination in reducing A β - related neuropathology and cognitive decline . We found that maternal vaccination reduced A β pathology drama - tically independently of active vaccination , in a long - lasting manner , months after MAbs were undetectable . A combination of maternal and active vaccination yielded the most potent results in reducing cerebral A β levels and ameliorating cognitive decline . Mechanistically , we propose that maternal vaccination activates the FcR - Syk - co ﬁ lin axis , resulting in actin regulation and promotion of A β clearance by microglial cells . In vitro phagocytosis was indeed facilitated by MAbs , via Syk - dependent pathways . Thus , maternal vaccination may provide a novel therapeutic approach for preventing early A β accumulation and dementia , as occurs in DS individuals and some variants of fEOAD . Methods Study design . 8 - week old C57BL6 WT female mice ( n = 10 / group ) were actively vaccinated using the A β CoreS DNA - vaccine ( Fig . 1a ) . Females were then crossed with 5xFAD males . IgG transfer via the placenta and lactation were assessed in one cohort ( n = 10 / group ) , while long - term effects of maternal and active vaccination were tested in a second cohort ( n = 5 / group ) . At 1m , active vaccination against A β or sham was administered to maternally or sham - vaccinated offspring , to yield four experimental groups : sham - vaccinated M − / A − , maternally vaccinated M + / A − , actively vaccinated M − / A + , and combined maternal and actively vaccinated mice M + / A + . Sham - vaccinated WT mice were used as healthy controls . Animals . The 5xFAD EOAD mouse model ( Jackson Laboratories # 34840 ) , which encompasses ﬁ ve AD - related mutations within the APP and PSEN1 genes 36 , was used in this study to model early A β accumulation in DS . 5xFAD mice were generously provided by Michal Schwartz ( The Weizmann Institute , Rehovot , Israel ) . C57BL mice were used as dams and healthy controls ( Jackson Laboratories # 000664 , Bar Harbor , ME ) .
