Structure can help , but adding structure to a problem space also takes signifcant efort . ProbMap is a novel application for automatically constructing a design gallery from unstructured text input . Given a list of problem statements , ProbMap extracts and semantically groups the stakeholders to construct hierarchical search facets which enables designers to more efciently navigate the problem statements . We contribute a novel feature extraction algorithm using natural language processing and a technique for automatically constructing a design gallery .

However , collecting , curating , and making sense of large - scale community input is still a major challenge [ 8 , 14 ] . Navigating a large com - plex problem space can be cognitively demanding—even for expert designers [ 24 ] . Prior work shows how design galleries can sum - marize diverse design artifacts such as posters [ 9 ] , solutions [ 22 ] , websites [ 6 , 12 , 16 , 21 ] , visualizations [ 15 ] , images [ 5 ] , works of art [ 10 ] , mobile apps [ 13 ] , products [ 6 , 18 ] , and generative design concepts [ 17 ] . Design galleries provide structure to the design space and designers tend to beneft when ideas are grouped semantically into clusters , rather than being presented without structure [ 19 ] . Often , users navigate design galleries through faceted search . For example , D . Tour curates design websites by the amount of text on the page , the primary colors , and the visual composition [ 21 ] . Search facets are often derived from the design artifacts themselves through manual annotations [ 3 ] or feature extraction [ 21 ] . However , feature extraction methods , and design galleries more broadly , have focused on visual design contexts , and less so on text - based features . We introduce ProbMap a text - based design gallery that is gen - erated automatically by extracting stakeholders and using them as search facets to help designers navigate large complex problem spaces . Our approach leverages natural language processing and clustering to facilitate problem space exploration . By clustering stakeholders into semantic groups , we also provide hierarchical search facets to help designers see the design space at multiple lev - els of abstraction and reduce the dimensionality of the design space . We make the following contributions : 1 ) a novel design gallery that focuses on presenting problem statements , 2 ) a feature extrac - tion method to identify stakeholders from unstructured problem statement , 3 ) a method to automatically afnity map stakeholders through semantic clustering . 2 SYSTEM OVERVIEW AND CORPUS ProbMap , shown in Figure 1 , is an algorithm and system for curating unstructured text - based design data , such as problem statements . ProbMap automates common design activities completed by expert designers such as stakeholder identifcation and afnity mapping . We collected a corpus of 679 problem statements from a series of community design workshops and class assignments related to COVID - 19 . From these statements , ProbMap extracted 248 distinct stakeholders which were clustered into 68 stakeholder groups . The following sub - sections detail our approach . 2 . 1 Feature Extraction ( Identify Stakeholders ) Stakeholders are the people who afect or are afected by a problem or solution . Identifying stakeholders is an essential starting point for any human - centered design process [ 4 , 20 ] . Previous research has focused on extracting key design information from products [ 7 ] , research papers [ 1 , 2 ] , and websites [ 21 ] . However , extracting design information about potential users and stakeholders might help to focus design activities toward a human - centered perspective . To automatically extract stakeholders from our corpus of prob - lem statements , we developed a novel feature extraction method shown in Figure 2 . Our approach starts by identifying noun and noun phrases using Part - of - Speech Tagging algorithms provided by the NLTK 1 and TextBlob Python packages 2 . Next , we lemma - tized the noun to resolve entities such as Merchant and Merchants . Finally , we use ConceptNet to determine if each noun is a stake - holder . ConceptNet is a knowledge graph that connects words and phrases [ 23 ] through conceptual relationships . For each extracted noun , we recursively traverse ConceptNet through IsA relation - ships to determine if the root concept is Person . As an example , ( Merchant ) − [ : isA ] − > ( Person ) . Figure 2 : Our feature extraction method for identifying stakeholders within problem statements . To evaluate , we randomly selected 50 problem statements from our corpus and labeled the stakeholders . There was moderate agree - ment ( α u = 0 . 63 ) between the labels from a human coder and our fea - ture extraction algorithm as measured by Krippendorf’s α u [ 11 ] —a measure of inter - rater reliability for segmentation ( i . e . : unitization ) . 2 . 2 Clustering ( Afnity Mapping ) Designers often engage in sense - making activities , such as afnity mapping , to distill insights from large collections of unstructured or semi - structured user research . These activities focuses the de - signer’s attention on the most important design aspects . To mimic this afnity mapping process , we developed an algo - rithm for clustering stakeholders into semantically similar groups . Our algorithm frst creates an adjacency matrix based on the pair - wise similarity of each stakeholder . Pairwise similarity was com - puted from the cosine similarity of the word embeddings using the Universal Sentence Encoder 3 . The resulting adjacency matrix represents an undirected and unweighted graph where edges were drawn between vertices when the similarity was above a threshold of 0 . 55 . Finally , Markov Clustering ( MCL ) automatically identifes clusters based on a simulation of stochastic fow of the graph [ 25 , 26 ] using the Markov Clustering Python library 4 . Finally , we select the cluster label by choosing the most common noun phrase . 3 DISCUSSION Based on our initial evaluation , ProbMap had moderate agreement with human coders related to stakeholder identifcation . The clus - ters also appear to provide sensible groupings . For example , one of 1 https : / / www . nltk . org / 2 https : / / github . com / sloria / textblob 3 https : / / tfhub . dev / google / universal - sentence - encoder / 1 4 https : / / markov - clustering . readthedocs . io 135 ProbMap : Automatically constructing design galleries through feature extraction and semantic clustering UIST ’21 Adjunct , October 10 – 14 , 2021 , Virtual Event , USA the clusters labeled ‘students’ includes college students , international students , freshman students , teachers , and other semantically sim - ilar stakeholders . The ‘city leaders’ cluster contained city leaders , politicians , government ofcials , mayors , and others . Overall , the clusters were relatively diverse and included essential workers , stu - dents , elderly people , city leaders , business owners , homeless , patients , drivers , and parents . This demonstrate the depth and breadth of stakeholders that ProbMap is capable of curating . This demo paper presents a new method for making sense of unstructured text - based design data , specifcally problem statements , by automating design activities that are traditionally completed by expert designers .
