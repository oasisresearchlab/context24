Correspondence : nelambert @ augusta . edu ORCID : 0000 - 0001 - 7550 - 0921 Abstract Classical G protein - coupled receptor ( GPCR ) signaling takes place in response to extracellular stimuli and involves receptors and heterotrimeric G proteins located at the plasma membrane . It has recently been established that GPCR signaling can also take place from intracellular membrane compartments , including endosomes that contain internalized receptors and ligands . While the mechanisms of GPCR endocytosis are well understood , it is not clear how internalized receptors are supplied with G proteins . To address this gap we use gene editing , confocal microscopy , and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer to study the distribution and trafficking of endogenous G proteins . We show here that constitutive endocytosis is sufficient to supply newly internalized endocytic vesicles with 20 - 30 % of the G protein density found at the plasma membrane . We find that G proteins are present on early , late , and recycling endosomes , are abundant on lysosomes , but are virtually undetectable on the endoplasmic reticulum , mitochondria , and the medial Golgi apparatus . Receptor activation does not change heterotrimer abundance on endosomes . Our results provide a detailed subcellular map of endogenous G protein distribution , suggest that G proteins may be partially excluded from nascent endocytic vesicles , and are likely to have implications for GPCR signaling from endosomes and other intracellular compartments . 2 Introduction Heterotrimeric G proteins transduce a vast number of important physiological signals ( Gilman , 1987 ) , most often in response to activation by G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) ( Pierce , Premont , & Lefkowitz , 2002 ) . Canonical G protein signaling occurs when a cell surface GPCR is activated by an extracellular ligand , which in turn promotes activation of plasma membrane G protein heterotrimers and downstream effectors . Recently , it has become clear that GPCRs can also signal from intracellular compartments ( Calebiro et al . , 2010 ; Eichel & von Zastrow , 2018 ) , most notably endosomes and the Golgi apparatus ( Calebiro et al . , 2009 ; Ferrandon et al . , 2009 ; Irannejad et al . , 2017 ; Irannejad et al . , 2013 ; Mullershausen et al . , 2009 ) . Signaling from endosomes is often a continuation of signaling that starts at the plasma membrane and persists as ( or resumes after ) active receptors are endocytosed ( Tsvetanova , Irannejad , & von Zastrow , 2015 ) . Much is known about the machinery responsible for GPCR internalization , and also about the trafficking itineraries of specific receptors after endocytosis . Some receptors are efficiently sorted for recycling and are returned to the plasma membrane , whereas other receptors are rapidly degraded ( Hanyaloglu & von Zastrow , 2008 ) . It is also known that at least one isoform of the G protein effector adenylyl cyclase is actively internalized ( Lazar et al . , 2020 ) . In contrast , much less is known about how G protein heterotrimers traffic from the plasma membrane through intracellular compartments ( Wedegaertner , 2012 ) . It is not known how efficiently heterotrimers are loaded onto endocytic vesicles at the plasma membrane , how receptor activation might change this process , or what the fate of G proteins might be after endocytosis . Activation at the plasma membrane promotes heterotrimer dissociation , and the resulting loss of membrane avidity allows G bg dimers and some G a subunits to translocate through the cytosol to sample intracellular membranes ( Akgoz , Kalyanaraman , & Gautam , 2004 ; Hynes et al . , 2004 ; Ransnäs et al . , 1989 ; Slepak & Hurley , 2008 ; Wedegaertner , Bourne , & von Zastrow , 1996 ) . However , these processes reverse quickly when activation ceases ( Akgoz , Kalyanaraman , & Gautam , 2004 ) , meaning that activation - dependent translocation of free G a subunits and G bg dimers would be an inefficient mechanism to deliver inactive heterotrimers to intracellular membranes . While G proteins have been detected on the surface of endosomes and other intracellular compartments ( Hewavitharana & Wedegaertner , 2012 ; Irannejad et al . , 2013 ; Scarselli & Donaldson , 2009 ; Wedegaertner , 2012 ) there has been no quantitative comparison of G protein distribution across subcellular compartments . Here we study the subcellular distribution of endogenous heterotrimeric G proteins in cultured cells using CRISPR - mediated gene editing , confocal imaging , and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer ( BRET ) . We find that G proteins are abundant on membrane 3 compartments that are functionally continuous with the plasma membrane , including early , late , and recycling endosomes . However , heterotrimer density on endocytic membranes is lower than on the plasma membrane , suggesting that G protein endocytosis is inefficient . Endocytic trafficking of G proteins is not regulated by GPCRs . Our findings are likely to have implications for GPCR signaling from endosomes , as internalized receptors are concentrated in G protein - deficient compartments . Results To study the localization of endogenous G proteins we used gene editing to attach small peptide tags to the amino terminus of G b 1 subunits ( GNB1 ) in HEK 293 cells . We chose this subunit because it is the most abundant G b subunit in this cell type ( Cho et al . , 2022 ) , it can associate with any type of G a or G g subunit ( Hillenbrand et al . , 2015 ) , and it can be labeled without disrupting heterotrimer formation or function . For bioluminescence experiments we added the HiBit tag ( Schwinn et al . , 2018 ) and isolated clonal “HiBit - b 1 “ cell lines . For imaging experiments we added a tandem tag that included the 11 th beta strand of mNeonGreen2 ( mNG2 ( 11 ) ) ( Feng et al . , 2017 ) and HiBit in cells constitutively expressing mNG2 ( 1 - 10 ) and isolated “mNG - b 1 “ cell lines ( Figure 1A ) . Amplicon sequencing verified that cell lines had correctly edited GNB1 genes and SDS - PAGE revealed single proteins with apparent molecular weights consistent with edited G b 1 subunits ( Figure 1B ) . BRET assays demonstrated that tagged subunits in HiBit - b 1 and mNG - b 1 cell lines formed functional heterotrimers with endogenous G a and G g subunits ( Figure 1C , D ) . Endogenous G a and G b subunits are expressed at approximately a 1 : 1 ratio , and G b subunits are tightly associated with G g and inactive G a subunits ( Cho et al . , 2022 ; Gilman , 1987 ; Krumins & Gilman , 2006 ) , therefore we assume that the large majority of mNG - b 1 and HiBit - b 1 subunits in unstimulated cells are part of heterotrimers . Endogenous G proteins primarily associate with the plasma membrane and endolysosomes Confocal imaging of mNG - b 1 cells revealed the expected bright fluorescence at the plasma membrane . Most cells also contained pleiomorphic intracellular structures and dim cytosolic fluorescence that was sufficient to suggest relative exclusion of mNG - b 1 from the nucleus . Especially notable were clusters of large vesicular structures located at the cell periphery which 4 were later identified as lysosomes ( Figure 2A ; see below ) . Large intracellular organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum , mitochondria , and Golgi apparatus were not evident . To identify the intracellular membrane compartments with mNG - b 1 fluorescence we coexpressed a series of organelle markers tagged with red fluorescent proteins . Markers of the endoplasmic reticulum , mitochondria and medial Golgi apparatus indicated that these large compartments were virtually devoid of mNG - b 1 fluorescence ( Figure 2B - D , Figure 2 - figure supplements 1 - 3 ) . In some cells an indistinct region of mNG - b 1 fluorescence was interleaved with leaflets of the Golgi apparatus , but line profiles suggested that this was a distinct structure ( Figure 2D , Figure 2 - figure supplement 3 ) , most likely the perinuclear recycling compartment ( see below ) . In contrast , mNG - b 1 clearly colocalized with the marker FYVE , which binds to phosphatidylinositol - 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) on the surface of endosomes ( Figure 3A , B , Figure 3 - figure supplement 1 ) . However , mNG - b 1 fluorescence was not detected on every FYVE - positive vesicle and when present was much less intense than fluorescence of adjacent segments of the plasma membrane ( Figure 3B ) . The median signal - to - background ratio for FYVE - positive structures was less than one - fourth that of the plasma membrane ( Figure 3C ) . FYVE domains primarily localize to early endosomes ( Hammond & Balla , 2015 ) , so it was not surprising that similar colocalization of mNG - b 1 was observed with the early endosome marker rab5a . As was the case with FYVE , mNG - b 1 was detectable in some rab5a - positive vesicles but not others and was not as intense as the nearby plasma membrane ( Figure 3A , C , Figure 3 - figure supplement 2 ) . In order to determine the fate of G proteins after endocytosis we then examined mNG - b 1 colocalization with markers of recycling and late endosomes ( Stenmark , 2009 ) . Dim mNG - b 1 fluorescence was detected on indistinct rab11a - positive structures clustered diffusely in the vicinity of the nucleus ( Figure 3A , Figure 3 - figure supplement 3 ) , which we presumptively identified as the perinuclear recycling compartment ( PNRC ) . Similarly , mNG - b 1 colocalized extensively with vesicles labeled with rab7a , a marker of late endosomes ( Figure 3A , Figure 3 - figure supplement 4 ) . Notably , mNG - b 1 fluorescence was more intense on rab7a - positive late endosomes than on FYVE - or rab5a - positive early endosomes ( Figure 3C ) . The presence of mNG - b 1 on late endosomes suggested that some G proteins may be degraded by lysosomes . Accordingly , mNG - b 1 strongly colocalized with lysosomes marked with LysoView 633 ( Figure 3A , Figure 3 - figure supplement 5 ) or long - term incubation with fluorescent dextran ( Figure 3 - figure supplement 5 ) . In many instances the intensity of mNG - b 1 fluorescence on lysosomes was similar to that of the nearby plasma membrane ( Figure 3A ) . These imaging results suggest 5 that G proteins are likely to undergo endocytosis and enter both recycling and degradative pathways and may become more concentrated as late endosomes mature . As an alternative approach we performed bystander BRET experiments to map the subcellular localization of endogenous HiBit - b 1 . This approach provides an unbiased index of membrane protein colocalization from large populations of cells and has the additional advantage of very high sensitivity ( Lan et al . , 2012 ) . We expressed LgBit and a series of inert Venus - tagged membrane markers in HiBit - b 1 cells and observed large bystander signals at the plasma membrane , smaller bystander signals at endosomes , and very small bystander signals at the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria ( Figure 3D ) . Although bystander BRET signals cannot be directly compared between different compartments , these results are generally consistent with what we observed using confocal imaging and confirm the presence of G proteins on multiple endosomal compartments . Constitutive G protein endocytosis is inefficient That mNG - b 1 fluorescence was less intense on endosomes than the plasma membrane suggested that G protein density may be lower on the surface of endosomes than on the plasma membrane . However , differences in fluorescence intensity could be due to differences in the amount of membrane surface area sampled in the imaging volume . Likewise , differences in bystander BRET between compartments could be due to differences in several factors , including expression and efficiency of compartment - specific BRET acceptors . Therefore , we devised a co - labeling protocol that allowed us to compare mNG - b 1 fluorescence to the amount of newly internalized membrane imaged at endocytic vesicles , and to make the same measurements at the plasma membrane . To stain both the plasma membrane as well as newly formed endocytic vesicle membrane we exposed live cells to the styryl dye FM4 - 64 , which rapidly and reversibly partitions into ( but does not cross ) membranes and is only fluorescent in a hydrophobic environment ( Betz , Mao , & Smith , 1996 ) . When cells are exposed to FM4 - 64 at physiological temperatures the plasma membrane is stained immediately , and this is followed over the course of several minutes by the appearance of intracellular vesicles that have trapped the dye ( Figure 4A , Figure 4 - figure supplement 1 ) . As an orthogonal approach we stained cells with CellMask Deep Red , a lipophilic dye that permanently stains the plasma membrane and therefore is incorporated into endocytic vesicles . Both dyes are expected to produce fluorescence signals proportional to the surface area of the membrane sampled by the imaging method , allowing us to normalize the fluorescence of individual vesicles to the nearby plasma membrane . We reasoned that if G proteins are passively incorporated into endocytic vesicles 6 without any enrichment or exclusion , then mNG - b 1 fluorescence in each vesicle should have the same intensity relative to the plasma membrane as lipophilic dyes . After staining cells and allowing 15 minutes for constitutive endocytosis we found that FM4 - 64 and CellMask dyes reported similar amounts of membrane surface area in endocytic vesicles ( Figure 4A , B ) ; in both cases peak vesicle intensity was on average similar to the intensity of the plasma membrane ( Figure 4C ) . In contrast , peak mNG - b 1 fluorescence on the same endocytic vesicles was much less intense than the plasma membrane ( Figure 4A - C ) . There was considerable variability between individual vesicles , such that some vesicles contained no detectable mNG - b 1 fluorescence ( Figure 4A , Figure 4 - figure supplement 1 ) . This result confirms that heterotrimeric G proteins are present on newly internalized membrane but also suggests that G proteins are partially excluded from endocytic vesicles . Receptor activation does not change G protein endocytosis The above results suggested that constitutive endocytosis of heterotrimeric G proteins is inefficient . However , it is possible that GPCR and G protein activation could change how G proteins are loaded onto endocytic vesicles . To test this possibility , we performed similar imaging experiments with mNG - b 1 cells transfected with SNAP - tagged b 2 adrenergic receptors ( SNAPf - b 2 AR ) . This receptor is often used as a model of activity - dependent GPCR internalization ( Benovic et al . , 1988 ; von Zastrow & Kobilka , 1992 ) and has been shown to activate G proteins on endosomes ( Bowman , Shiwarski , & Puthenveedu , 2016 ; Irannejad et al . , 2013 ) . We labeled SNAPf - b 2 AR with a membrane - impermeant SNAP ligand ( AF 647 ) at room temperature to prevent constitutive endocytosis , then incubated cells with FM4 - 64 and the agonist isoproterenol for 15 minutes at physiological temperature to promote receptor endocytosis . Confocal imaging after agonist washout revealed numerous intracellular vesicles with intense AF 647 fluorescence , consistent with robust receptor internalization ( Figure 5A ) . Normalization and comparison to FM4 - 64 fluorescence indicated that SNAPf - b 2 AR was enriched approximately three - fold on endocytic vesicles compared to the nearby plasma membrane ( Figure 5B , C ) , consistent with active recruitment of active receptors to clathrin - coated pits and endocytic vesicles . In contrast , mNG - b 1 fluorescence in the same vesicles was again lower than expected given the amount of membrane imaged in each vesicle ( Figure 5B , C ) . Once again there was considerable variability between individual endocytic vesicles ( Figure 5A , D ) . Using FM4 - 64 fluorescence as a standard for membrane surface area we calculated that mNG - b 1 density on receptor - containing vesicles was 28 ± 8 % ( mean ± 95 % CI ; n = 91 ) of the 7 nearby plasma membrane . Although this density was higher than that calculated for vesicles formed by constitutive endocytosis ( 20 ± 8 % ; n = 45 ) , the difference did not reach significance ( Figure 5D ) . These results demonstrate that activation - dependent internalization of b 2 adrenergic receptors does not significantly promote or prevent loading of G proteins onto endocytic vesicles . These findings suggested that receptor activation should have no impact on the abundance of G proteins on endosomes . To test this idea , we performed bystander BRET experiments with HiBit - b 1 cells transiently expressing b 2 adrenergic , D2 dopamine or M3 muscarinic receptors to activate G s , G i / o and G q / 11 heterotrimers , respectively . We incubated cells with agonist for 30 minutes under conditions permissive for vesicular trafficking , then washed with antagonist to allow receptors and heterotrimers to become inactive prior to measuring BRET . Under these conditions no significant changes in bystander BRET were observed at any endosome compartment ( Figure 5E ) . These results support the idea that receptor and G protein activation do not lead to persistent changes in G protein abundance on the surface of endosomes . Discussion While the mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis , chaperoning and trafficking of nascent G protein heterotrimers are fairly well understood ( Gabay et al . , 2011 ; Marrari et al . , 2007 ; Wedegaertner , 2012 ) , the mechanisms that regulate the subcellular distribution of heterotrimers after delivery to the plasma membrane have not been studied as extensively . Here we show that constitutive and activity - dependent endocytosis of G proteins is inefficient . Avoidance of endocytosis is likely to be important for maintaining a high density of heterotrimers at the plasma membrane , where much important signaling takes place . On the other hand , this limits the abundance of G proteins on the surface of endosomes . At present we can only speculate regarding the mechanism that limits G protein density on endocytic vesicles . Many endocytosis mechanisms , including clathrin - mediated endocytosis , rely on bulky coat proteins and adapters to induce membrane curvature and recruit cargo ( Doherty & McMahon , 2009 ) . One possibility is that heterotrimeric G proteins are simply excluded from nascent endocytic vesicles by steric occlusion . While large extracellular domains are known to impede endocytosis of membrane proteins ( DeGroot et al . , 2018 ) , a similar relationship has not been demonstrated for intracellular domains . It is noteworthy that the monomeric G proteins H - Ras and N - Ras are also less abundant on endosomes than the plasma membrane , and therefore are separated from 8 internalized growth factor receptors ( Pinilla - Macua , Watkins , & Sorkin , 2016 ; Surve , Watkins , & Sorkin , 2021 ) . Some studies using overexpressed G protein subunits have suggested that a large pool of G proteins is located on intracellular membranes , including the Golgi apparatus ( Chisari et al . , 2007 ; Saini et al . , 2007 ; Tsutsumi et al . , 2009 ) , whereas others have indicated a distribution that is dominated by the plasma membrane ( Crouthamel et al . , 2008 ; Evanko , Thiyagarajan , & Wedegaertner , 2000 ; Marrari et al . , 2007 ; Takida & Wedegaertner , 2003 ) . A likely factor contributing to this discrepancy is the stoichiometry of overexpressed subunits , as neither G a nor G bg traffic appropriately to the plasma membrane as free subunits ( Wedegaertner , 2012 ) . Our results show that endogenous G proteins are primarily located on the plasma membrane and are present on internal membranes at substantially lower levels . We identify the specific intracellular compartments where G proteins are found and show the relative abundance of G proteins on each compartment . Nascent heterotrimers are likely formed and lipid modified on the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus ( Wedegaertner , 2012 ) , yet few heterotrimers can be found on these compartments at any given moment , consistent with a relatively slow rate of turnover compared to forward trafficking during biosynthesis ( Gabay et al . , 2011 ) . In the present study we have limited our analysis to the medial portion of the Golgi apparatus . It is possible that G proteins may be more abundant on the trans - Golgi network , as this compartment is involved in membrane protein recycling ( Nakano , 2022 ) . Likewise , we found that few heterotrimers are associated with mitochondria , despite the fact that previous studies have demonstrated functional roles for G proteins on these organelles ( Hewavitharana & Wedegaertner , 2012 ) . Our results suggest that GPCR signaling from intracellular compartments will generally have to be transduced by a lower density of G proteins . Fully lipid - modified heterotrimers in their inactive state are unlikely to detach from membranes at a significant rate ( Shahinian & Silvius , 1995 ) . Therefore , we infer from the presence of G b 1 on early , late , and recycling endosomes that heterotrimers undergo vesicle - mediated endocytosis in unstimulated cells and are not efficiently sorted to either the slow recycling pathway or the degradative pathway . Our results are largely consistent with the hypothesis that G proteins passively follow bulk endocytic flow of membrane and suggest that at least some G proteins are recycled to the plasma membrane . Our imaging results also show that G proteins are apparently more abundant on late endosomes and lysosomes than on early endosomes , suggesting that they become concentrated as late endosomes mature . We cannot exclude the possibility that heterotrimers traffic between membrane compartments by mechanisms other than vesicular trafficking ( Saini , Chisari , & Gautam , 2009 ) . However , even if 9 this is the case our conclusions that G proteins are internalized inefficiently and are present at lower density on most intracellular membranes are still valid . The cell lines we developed should prove useful for answering additional questions related to G protein regulation , such as possible non - vesicular translocation due to palmitate turnover ( Saini , Chisari , & Gautam , 2009 ; Wedegaertner & Bourne , 1994 ) , the role of ubiquitination ( Dohlman & Campbell , 2019 ) , and localization in subcompartments not studied here . Our study is not without limitations . Our labeling strategy was designed to interfere as little as possible with heterotrimer function , but we cannot rule out the possibility that the tags we used to visualize and track G proteins had some influence on their trafficking . By labeling G b 1 subunits we cannot directly distinguish heterotrimers from free G bg dimers , complicating interpretation . This strategy also does not allow us to resolve heterotrimers containing different G a subunits . It is quite possible that heterotrimers containing different G a subunits could be subject to different trafficking mechanisms . Our conclusion that GPCR activation has no lasting effect on the subcellular distribution of G proteins rests on three representative receptors , chosen because they activate three of the four major G protein families . It is possible that other receptors will influence G protein distribution using mechanisms not shared by the receptors we studied . Finally , our study was limited to a single non - differentiated cell type . It would not be surprising to find that differentiated cells have mechanisms to regulate G protein trafficking and distribution that are not shared by the model cells we used ( Calebiro et al . , 2009 ; Kotowski et al . , 2011 ; Lin et al . , 2024 ; Puri et al . , 2022 ) . In summary , here we show that heterotrimeric G proteins are more abundant on the plasma membrane than on any intracellular compartment where they are thought to be important for signaling . Our results are likely to have functional implications for signaling from intracellular compartments . Receptor - G protein coupling is thought to be rate - limited by collision and G protein abundance ( Hein et al . , 2005 ) , and decreasing G protein expression is known to impair downstream signaling ( Gabay et al . , 2011 ; Schwindinger et al . , 1997 ) . Signaling from endosomes and other compartments may thus be disadvantaged by a low density of G proteins . Further studies are warranted to examine the stoichiometry of receptors , G proteins , regulators , and effectors in different subcellular compartments and how this affects signaling . Materials and Methods Cell culture and transfection . Human embryonic kidney HEK 293 cells ( ATCC ; CRL - 1573 ) were propagated in 100 mm dishes , on 6 - well plates , or on 25 mm round coverslips in high glucose DMEM ( Cytiva ) and 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Cytiva ) supplemented with penicillin streptomycin ( Gibco ) . HEK 293T cells stably expressing mNG2 ( 1 - 10 ) ( Cho et al . , 2022 ) were kindly supplied by Manuel Leonetti ( Chan Zuckerberg Biohub San Francisco ) . Cells were transfected in growth medium using linear polyethyleneimine MAX ( Polysciences ) at a nitrogen / phosphate ratio of 20 and were used for experiments 24 - 48 hours later . Up to 3 . 0 µ g of plasmid DNA was transfected in each well of a 6 - well plate . Gene editing .

RNP and repair ssODNs ( dissolved in nuclease - free water ) were added to single - cell suspensions ( 10 µ l of 1 . 2 ´ 10 4 cells µ l - 1 ) and electroporated using a Neon™ Transfection device ( Invitrogen ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . Cells were expanded and diluted into 48 - well plates and grown for 3 weeks . Wells containing single cell colonies were duplicated into 12 - well plates and screened for HiBit expression by mixing crude lysates with purified LgBit protein ( Promega ) and measuring luminescence in the presence of 5 µ M furimazine . After clone expansion genomic DNA was extracted using the GeneJET Genomic DNA purification kit ( ThermoFisher ) and used as a template for amplicon sequencing . Sequencing primers were designed to span the editing site and to produce amplicons less than 500 base pairs in length . Amplicon sequencing was performed by Azenta Life Sciences ( Amplicon - EZ ) and analyzed using CRISPResso2 . Cell lines used for experiments had correctly edited alleles but were hemizygous due to competing repair mechanisms .

SNAPf - b 2 AR , SNAPf - D2R , SNAPf - M3R and D2S - Nluc were kindly provided by Jonathan Javitch ( Columbia University ) . Venus - Kras , Venus - PTP1b , Venus - MOA , Venus - rab5a , Venus - rab7a , Venus - rab11a and memGRKct - Venus were described previously ( Hollins et al . , 2009 ; Lan et al . , 2012 ) . All plasmids were verified by automated sequencing . Imaging . Imaging was performed on a Leica SP8 laser scanning confocal microscope using a 63 ´ 1 . 40 NA oil immersion objective . Cells grown on 25 mm round coverslips were transferred to a steel imaging chamber and imaged in HEPES Imaging ( HI ) buffer which contained 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM NaHEPES , 5 mM glucose , 2 . 5 mM KCl , 1 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 ( pH 7 . 2 ) . All imaging was carried out at room temperature with the exception of the experiment shown in SI Appendix Figure S9 , which was carried out at 37 ° C . For colocalization of mNG - b 1 and red organelle markers 0 . 2 µ g of each marker was transfected per coverslip ; mNG - b 1 was excited at 488 nm and detected at 495 - 545 nm , and red markers were excited at 552 nm and detected at 565 - 665 nm . Lysosomes were stained with either LysoView 633 ( Biotium ; 1 : 1 , 000 in growth medium for 15 minutes at 37 ° C ) or 10 , 000 m . w . CF 640 dextran ( Biotium ; 25 µ g ml - 1 overnight at 37 ° C followed by a 60 - minute chase ) ; both dyes were excited at 638 nm and detected at 650 - 700 nm . For simultaneous imaging of mNG - b 1 , FM4 - 64 and CellMask Deep Red , cells were placed in HI buffer containing 1 : 1 , 000 CellMask Deep Red ( Invitrogen ) for 15 minutes at room temperature , then returned to culture medium containing 5 µ M FM4 - 64 ( a . k . a . SynaptoRed ; Calbiochem ) and incubated at 37 ° C for 15 minutes . Imaging was then performed in HI buffer containing 5 µ M FM4 - 64 . For simultaneous imaging of mNG - b 1 , FM4 - 64 and b 2 AR , cells were transfected with 1 µ g of SNAPf - b 2 AR , stained in HI buffer containing 5 µ M SNAP - Surface Alexa 647 ( New England Biolabs ) for 15 minutes at room temperature , then returned to culture medium containing 10 µ M isoproterenol and 5 µ M FM4 - 64 and incubated at 37 ° C for 15 minutes . Imaging was then performed in HI buffer containing 5 µ M FM4 - 64 . CellMask Deep Red and SNAP - Surface Alexa 647 were excited at 638 nm and detected at 650 - 700 nm ; mNG - b 1 and FM4 - 64 were excited at 488 nm and detected at 500 - 570 nm and 675 - 755 nm , respectively . Image analysis . Signal / background ratios for the plasma membrane and endosomes ( Figure 3C ) were calculated using mean fluorescence values from rectangular ( for the plasma membrane ) and round ( for endosomes ) regions of interest ( ROIs ) surrounding the structures and nearby cytosol ( for background ) . A single plasma membrane ROI and 1 - 3 endosome ROIs were sampled per cell / image . Mean fluorescence intensity line profiles were extracted from 3 µ m lines centered on vesicles as absolute fluorescence intensity ( Figure 3B ) , or fluorescence intensity normalized to the mean intensity of a nearby section of plasma membrane ( Figure 4C and Figure 5C ) . Vesicles that contained and did not contain internalized receptors were compared ( Figure 5D ) by dividing the peak mNG - b 1 signal by the peak FM4 - 64 signal for each vesicle ; both signals were first normalized to their respective plasma membrane signals and subjected to background subtraction . A single vesicle was sampled per cell / image . All image analysis was carried out using ImageJ and raw images . For construction of figures images were exported as . TIF files with or without uniform contrast enhancement applied by ImageJ . BRET . For bystander BRET mapping of HiBit - b 1 localization cells were transfected in 6 - well plates with 1 µ g per well of a Venus - tagged compartment marker and 0 . 1 µ g per well of CMV - LgBit . For measurements cells were resuspended in Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline ( DPBS ) . For long - term agonist stimulation ( Figure 5E ) HiBit - b 1 cells expressing CMV - LgBit ( 0 . 1 µ g per well ) and either SNAPf - b 2AR , SNAPf - D2R or SNAPf - M3R ( 0 . 5 µ g per well ) were 12 incubated with agonist for 30 minutes in the incubator , then washed and resuspended in DPBS containing antagonist prior to reading BRET . Agonists were isoproterenol ( 10 µ M ) , dopamine ( 100 µ M ) and acetylcholine ( 100 µ M ) ; antagonists were ICI 118551 ( 10 µ M ) , haloperidol ( 10 µ M ) and atropine ( 10 µ M ) ; all small molecule ligands were obtained from Millipore Sigma or Cayman Chemical . For functional validation of mNG - b 1 cells , D2R - Nluc ( 50 ng per well ) was transfected , and cells were resuspended in permeabilization buffer ( KPS ) containing 140 mM KCl , 10 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM Potassium EGTA , 20 mM NaHEPES ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 10 µ g ml −1 high - purity digitonin and 2U ml −1 apyrase . Kinetic BRET measurements were made from permeabilized cells during sequential injection of dopamine ( 100 µ M ) and GDP ( 100 µ M ) . For functional validation of HiBit - b 1 cells , SNAPf - b 2AR , SNAPf - D2R or SNAPf - M3R ( 0 . 5 µ g per well ) , CMV - LgBit ( 0 . 1 µ g per well ) and memGRK3ct - Venus ( 0 . 5 µ g per well ) were transfected , and cells were resuspended in DPBS . Kinetic BRET measurements were made from intact cells during sequential injection of agonists and antagonists at the concentrations listed above . All BRET measurements were made in buffer solutions containing the substrate furimazine ( Promega or ChemShuttle ; 1 : 1 , 000 from a 5 mM stock dissolved in 90 % ethanol / 10 % glycerol ) . Steady - state BRET and luminescence measurements were made using a Mithras LB940 photon - counting plate reader ( Berthold Technologies GmbH ) running MicroWin2000 software . Kinetic BRET measurements were made using a Polarstar Optima plate reader ( BMG Labtech ) running BMG Optima version 2 . 20R2 software . Raw BRET signals were calculated as the emission intensity at 520 – 545 nm divided by the emission intensity at 475 – 495 nm . Net BRET signals were calculated as the raw BRET signal minus the raw BRET signal measured from cells expressing only the donor . Statistical analysis . All statistical testing was carried out using GraphPad Prism version 10 . 1 . 1 . Comparison of mNG signals in vesicles with and without receptors ( Figure 5D ) was made using an unpaired t - test . Comparison of endosome bystander signals with and without agonist treatment ( Figure 5E ) was made using paired t - tests with a false discovery rate ( FDR ) of 1 % ( method of Benjamini , Krieger and Yekutieli ) .
