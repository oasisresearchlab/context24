Methods Secondary attack rates ( SARs ) for schools and day - care centres were calculated using data from state - wide mandatory notification of SARS - CoV - 2 index cases in educational institutions and additional information on routine contact tracing and PCR - testing . Findings From August to December 2020 , every sixth of overall 784 independent index cases caused a transmission in educational institutions ( risk 0·17 , 95 % CI 0·14 – 0·19 ) . In a subgroup , monitoring of 14 , 594 institutional high - risk contacts ( 89 % PCR - tested ) of 441 index cases revealed 196 secondary cases ( SAR 1·34 % , 1·16 – 1·54 ) . Transmission was more likely from teachers than from students / children ( incidence risk ratio [ IRR ] 3·17 , 1·79 – 5·59 ) , and from index cases in day - care centres ( IRR 3·23 , 1·76 – 5·91 ) than from those in secondary schools . In 748 index cases , teachers caused four times more secondary cases than children ( 1·08 vs . 0·25 secondary cases per index , IRR 4·39 , 2·67 – 7·21 ) . This difference was mainly due to common transmission from teacher index cases to teacher contacts ( mean secondary cases 0·56 teacher to teacher vs . 0·04 child to teacher , IRR 13·3 , 6·6 – 26·7 ) . Interpretation In educational institutions , the risk of contacts to a confirmed COVID - 19 case for infection is one percent , but varies depending on type of institution and index case . Hygiene measures targeting the day - care setting and teacher - to - teacher transmission are priorities in reducing the burden of infection and may promote on - site education during the pandemic .

Following a similar strategy , we also searched Google Scholar , SSRN , medRxiv , and the reference lists of identified literature . We found one recent systematic review that pooled findings from five small - scale cohort studies on COVID - 19 transmission risk published until 14th September 2020 on overall 18 index cases and 3 , 345 contact persons into a combined infection attack rate estimate of 0·08 % ( 95 % CI 0·00 - 0·86 ) . Since then , another three cohort studies on transmission risk in schools and day - care centres have been published from Germany and Italy including 135 index cases and 4 , 188 contact persons and reporting secondary attack rates between one and three percent . The aforementioned systematic review found that , stratified by role of the index case , there was a non - significant trend towards higher infection attack rates in staff ( 0·70 % , 0·00 - 3·56 ) than in student index cases ( 0·15 % , 0·00 - 0·93 ) , but recommended further research to confirm this trend . Similarly , a cross - sectional study using data from 30 outbreaks during the first COVID - 19 wave in 2020 in the U . K . pointed towards an increased risk of SARS - CoV - 2 in staff compared to students . A number of modelling studies from the first wave of COVID - 19 provide inconclusive results . While two publications , one from several countries and one from Switzerland , concluded that school closures contributed markedly to the reduction of transmission and mobility , two other studies , one using cross - country data and one from Japan rated school closures among the least effective measures to reduce COVID - 19 incidence rates . Added value of this study By both , the number of index cases and contact persons studied , this cohort study is more than twice larger than the total of all published cohort studies on COVID - 19 transmission risk in schools and day - care centres combined . Besides , this is the first study on transmission risk in schools to incorporate a period of drastically changing background incidence in the source .

Based on data that emerged from the current public health practice in Germany , which frequently incorporates routine PCR - testing during active follow - up of asymptomatic high - risk contacts to index cases , this study provides a precise estimate of the true underlying SARS - CoV - 2 transmission risk in schools and day - care centres . Thanks to the large sample size , this study allows for a meaningful examination of differences in the risk of transmission with respect to the characteristics of the index case . We found that the individual risk of acquiring SARS - CoV - 2 among high - risk contacts in the educational setting is 1·3 % , but that this risk rises to 3·2 % when the index case is a teacher and to 2·5 % when the index case occurs in a day - care centre . Furthermore , we could show that , on average , teacher index case produced about four times as many secondary cases as student / child index cases . Despite the relatively small proportion of teachers among index cases ( 20 % ) , our study of transmission pathways revealed that the majority of all secondary cases ( 54 % ) , and the overwhelming majority of secondary cases in teachers ( 78 % ) were caused by teacher index cases . Implications of all the available evidence In this setting , where preventative measures are in place and COVID - 19 incidence rates were rising sharply in the population , we found a low and stable transmission risk in educational institutions , which provides evidence for the effectiveness of current preventative measures to control the spread of COVID - 19 in schools . The identification of a substantial transmission risk within the group of teachers , but not between children / students and teachers indicates the need for an additional focus on infection prevention during teachers’ activities outside the classroom , e . g . in staff - meetings and in break rooms . Our findings on substantial variation in transmission risk can be useful for a more tailored risk assessment during the early phase of infection control in schools and day - care centres . Taken together , the presented innovations have potential to safe public health resources ( e . g . testing ) and ensure sustained education during the pandemic . .

This task requires a profound scientific basis on the beneficial and hazardous effects of these restrictions on social , economic , and health outcomes . Since the start of the colder season in the Northern Hemisphere , the number of infections with COVID - 19 has started to rise again , reaching more than half a million newly reported cases globally per day in December 2020 . 1 These alarmingly high numbers have led decision makers worldwide to impose partial or complete lockdowns . In the majority of countries , these measures include the full or partial closure of educational institutions . 2 The closure of schools and day - care centres has been one of the major debates since the start of the pandemic worldwide . 3 Although children generally develop milder symptoms than adults or stay asymptomatic , they can become infected with COVID - 19 and transmit the virus to others . 4 – 6 At the same time , the implications of school closures are multifaceted and are considered to affect children from most deprived families the hardest 3 , with limited access to computers and the internet as one out of several mechanisms mediating this disadvantage . Furthermore , even under the best conditions , home schooling with the parents , online teaching , TV education , or a combination thereof , are inferior learning environments as opposed to the classroom context . Besides , as schools also fulfil the task of child - care , school closures not only affect the children’s learning and mental health 7 , but also the parents’ ability to pursue their work obligations . Similar reasoning applies to day - care facilities : taking on more child - care duties is associated with economic losses for the parents , while the transfer of child - care duties to grandparents increases the risk of COVID - 19 for an older population group , which will be associated with a higher number of severe disease and eventually COVID - 19 - related deaths . 8 Analysing data from August to December 2020 on routine containment measures taken by District Public Health Authorities ( DPHAs ) around index cases in educational institutions in Rhineland - Palatinate , Germany , this study provides urgently needed information on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission risk and patterns in schools and day - care centres during a period with exponentially increasing COVID - 19 population incidence . .

During this period , publicly recommended hygiene measures in secondary schools ( i . e . beginning approximately with age 10 years ) in Rhineland Palatinate included ( i ) physical distancing ( > 1·5 meters ) , ( ii ) cross - or pulse - ventilation of class - rooms before and after class , and then every 20 minutes for 5 minutes during class , 11 ( iii ) face masks in school - buildings and “on campus” , but not in the class - room , ( iv ) increased frequency of surface cleaning , and ( v ) structural support of individual hygiene ( hand , cough etiquette ) . 12 , 13 On November 2 nd , 2020 , this concept was modified by additionally recommending face masks inside the classroom . 13 Comparable recommendations existed for primary schools and day - care centres , but exempting the children from physical distancing ( i ) and wearing of face masks ( iii ) . 14 SARS - CoV - 2 and COVID - 19 are notifiable according to the German Infectious Diseases Protection Act ( Infektionsschutzgesetz , IfSG ) , a Federal Law implemented by each Federal State’s own jurisdiction . Based hereon , physicians and laboratories have to notify COVID - 19 cases to the responsible DPHA alongside with contextual information . This includes information on whether the person is a child or teacher in a school or day - care centre ( § 33 IfSG ) . From the DPHAs , information on newly identified COVID - 19 cases is forwarded to one of the 16 Federal State Infectious Diseases Surveillance Centers ( Landesmeldestellen ) , within 24 hours , and from there to the national surveillance centre at Robert Koch - Institute ( RKI ) in Berlin . Origin of index cases and contact persons Each of the 24 DPHAs in Rhineland - Palatinate is responsible for all investigations around notifiable diseases , and represent populations between 61 , 000 and 430 , 000 individuals per district . Following the identification of a COVID - 19 case , qualified personnel at the competent DPHA interviews the index case , traces contacts , and initiates an active follow - up of those in category - I for fourteen days following the last contact with the index case . A category - I contact is defined as a person who either stayed face - to - face ( < 1·5 meters ) with a COVID - 19 - case for .

In the latter case , only SARS - CoV - 2 positive PCR - tests of secondary cases are notified to the DPHA , with the result that negative test results are only available to the DPHAs who organize testing themselves . This explains why DPHAs with external testing have missing information on the total number of tests done in contact persons of a given index cases , even when such testing was routinely offered to all contact persons as a standard procedure for all index cases included in this study . Study setting and definitions With start of the study , a 2 - page questionnaire was distributed to all DPHAs , alongside with detailed instructions on inclusion and exclusion criteria for index cases and a link to upload completed questionnaires ( ec . europa . eu / eusurvey ) . For inclusion into this study , an index case was defined as an individual that ( i ) tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 - RNA from respiratory material , ( ii ) was notified as working in or attending an educational institution according to § 33 IfSG , and ( iii ) had worked in or attended the institution for at least one day during the infectious period . The infectious period was defined as follows : ( i ) for symptomatic index cases as time from 2 days before to 10 days after onset of symptoms ; ( ii ) for asymptomatic cases with unknown origin from 2 days before to 10 days after the date of taking the diagnostic swab ; and ( iii ) for asymptomatic cases with known contact to a primary case from 3 days to 15 days after exposure . A secondary case was defined as an individual that was identified ( i ) as a contact person to an index case by the competent DPHA and ( ii ) tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 - RNA during the quarantine associated with that index case . Contact persons and secondary cases not attending the educational institution , e . g . persons living in the same household , were not to be reported in this questionnaire . Beginning with August 17 th , 2020 , we asked DPHAs to file one questionnaire for each eligible index case about 2 weeks after its identification , when information on all potential secondary cases would be available , i . e . after completion of .

Afterwards , DPHAs received requests for contribution to SARS - S on a weekly basis , alongside interim analysis of the surveillance . Statistical analysis Assuming equal exposure time in all contact persons of a given index case , we calculated secondary attack rates ( SAR , i . e . individual level risk of transmission ) as the proportion of secondary cases among contact persons of a given index case , together with corresponding binomial 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CIs ) . 16 Associations between transmission risk on the individual level and a number of the index case’s characteristics were analysed using negative binomial regression , providing estimates of the crude incidence risk ratio ( IRR ) comparing the SAR in exposed and unexposed together with its 95 % CI and a p - value testing H0 : “both SARs are equal” ( IRR = 1·0 ) . For sensitivity , we repeated these analyses based on the number of PCR - tested contacts only . The risk of causing a SARS - CoV - 2 cluster was calculated by dividing the number of index cases with at least one secondary case by the total number of index cases . To this end , we used binomial regression models estimating risk ratios ( RRs ) with 95 % CIs and p - values testing H0 : RR = 1·0 . Since this part of the analysis did not rely on an individual person denominator , it also included data from index cases with missing information on total number of contact persons and / or number of PCR tests done . Finally , we used negative binomial regression to estimate IRRs , their 95 % CIs , and corresponding p - values for comparing the proportions of secondary cases caused by students / children and teachers , respectively .

Sixteen percent of the 74 , 733 COVID - 19 cases notified in Rhineland - Palatinate in 2020 were younger than 20 years , which approximates the population proportion of 18·3 % in this age group . Among these , 1 , 954 notifications contained contextual information on educational institutions ( 1 , 298 students / children and 684 teachers ) , 84 % of which were notified during the study period . Secondary attack rates ( SAR ) Overall , DPHAs provided additional information for a total of 784 independent notified index cases attending an educational institution prior to diagnosis of a SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( 591 students / children , 157 teachers , 36 unknown role ) . Full information on PCR - testing was available for 14 , 591 contact persons to 441 index cases ( median 25 contacts per index case , IQR 17 - 40 ) . Among these , the DPHAs identified 81 clusters with 196 PCR - positive secondary cases ( SAR 1·34 % , 95 % CI 1·16 % – 1·54 % ) ( table 1 , left ) . Repeating the analysis based on only the 13 , 005 PCR - tested contacts ( PCR - coverage 89 % ) , gave an overall SAR of 1·51 ( 95 % CI 1·30 – 1·73 ) . The majority of contacts ( 71 % ) were tested between seven and ten days after their last contact with the index case ( supplementary figure 1 ) . The SARs varied by characteristic of the index case : role ( teacher > student / child , IRR = 3·17 , p < 0·001 ) , symptom status at time of diagnosis ( pre - / asymptomatic < symptomatic , IRR = 0·47 , p = 0·02 ) , type of institution ( day - care centres > secondary schools , IRR = 3·23 , p < 0·001 ) , and by age ( older than 35 years > age between 6 and 21 years ) ( table 1 , left ) . Cluster level risk and cluster size To calculate the risk of causing a cluster ( i . e . the risk of transmission to at least one secondary case ) , we included additional 343 index cases with complete information on secondary cases , but missing information on total number of contact persons tested . In the combined dataset of overall 784 index cases , there were 130 clusters reported via the SARS - Surveillance ( cluster risk 0·17 , 95 % CI 0·14 – 0·19 ) . We observed variation in risk of causing a cluster by .

Index cases in dynamic groups were more likely to cause SARS - CoV - 2 clusters than index cases in stable groups . Transmission patterns by role of index case Teacher index cases caused on average more secondary cases ( 169 / 157 , risk = 1·08 ) than students / children ( 145 / 591 , risk = 0·25 ; IRR 4·39 , p < 0·001 ) . The average number of secondary cases in teachers caused by a student / child index case was 0·04 ( corresponding to about one teacher secondary case in 25 student / child index cases ) compared to 0 . 56 ( one teacher secondary case in 2 teacher index cases ) when the index case was also a teacher ( IRR 13·25 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . A similar comparison looking at secondary cases in children / students found a similar , but less pronounced difference towards a more likely transmission from teacher index cases to student / child secondary cases ( 81 / 157 , risk = 0·52 ) compared to transmission in educational settings among peers ( 120 / 591 , risk = 0·20 , IRR 1·54 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Even though our study contains about four times as many index cases in students / children as teachers ( 591 vs . 157 ) , teachers caused more than three times as many secondary cases in teachers ( 88 vs . 25 secondary cases ) ( table 2 ) . Clusters of three or more teachers among secondary cases were almost exclusively caused by teacher index cases ( figure 2 ) . Index case , cluster size , and cluster - composition The 329 secondary cases reported in this study occurred in 130 clusters , while the majority , 654 of overall 784 indexes ( 83 % ) , led to zero secondary cases . In those 130 cases , where transmission occurred , the average cluster size was 2·5 secondary cases ( supplementary figure 2 ) . There were nine clusters reported with seven or more secondary cases ( table 3 ) , of which seven ( 78 % ) were caused by a teacher index . Seven of the large outbreaks were in day - care centres for young children , where the index cases had on average 78 category - I contacts . All nine outbreaks occurred in settings , where the index cases had a large number of category - I contacts ( between 37 and 166 contacts ) , as opposed to an average of 33 ( median 25 ) contacts per index case in the overall study . Larger outbreaks were more often caused by teachers ( mean cluster size 3·5 vs 1·9 ) explaining why “black dots” prevail when moving from the lower left to the upper right corner of the grid in figure 2 . Outbreaks involving several teachers follow commonly on an index case in teachers and rarely on an index in children / students , explaining why there is only a few white dots with proximity to the y - axis and clearly more white dots that .

Discussion This study provides evidence for the low transmission of COVID - 19 in schools and day - care centres in the current German setting , with high incidence rates and under preventative measures . We found , that approximately 1·3 % of school contacts of an index case will become SARS - CoV - 2 positive . When restricting the denominator to PCR - tested contacts , we found nearly the same secondary attack rate ( SAR ) of 1·5 % . These numbers are well in line with other published findings on risk of transmission in schools . 19 – 24 One other study from Germany based on 87 school index cases from the DPHA of Frankfurt calculated a slightly higher but comparable SAR of 1·9 % . 19 Other studies from different settings in Australia , Italy , Ireland , and Singapore also report comparable SARs between 0 % and 3 % . 20 – 23 Compared to students / children , the SAR was higher when the index case was a teacher . Likewise , the risk of causing a cluster and the mean number of secondary cases was higher when teachers were identified as index cases compared to students . Although not formally tested in other studies , mainly due to small sample size , descriptive findings in published literature already point towards larger numbers of secondary cases in teacher index cases and support our findings . 21 , 25 , 26 In one study from the UK , half of eighteen primary school outbreaks involved teachers only . 25 At the same time , we found that there is only limited transmission from child index cases to teachers , and that such events happen mainly in day - care centres : among a total of 591 student / child index cases , transmission was identified to 25 teachers : ( i ) thirteen children below six years of age caused 22 secondary infections in day - care teachers , ( ii ) while three school children caused three infections in school teachers . The fact that teachers themselves were the primary source of infection for teachers in educational institutions supports the hypothesis that professional contacts independent of teaching activities with students and children ( e . g . during staff meetings , work breaks ) are likely to contribute to transmission in educational institutions . The role of asymptomatic cases in the spread of the COVID - 19 pandemic has been subject of an ongoing debate . A recent review and meta - analysis found that the proportion of asymptomatic cases was 17 % of all COVID - 19 - positive cases . 27 , 28 They further report that the risk of transmission was about 40 % lower in asymptomatic cases as compared to symptomatic cases . While this is in line with our finding of a 50 % lower attack rate in contacts of .

Indeed , what we observed as ‘asymptomatic’ may in some cases just have been a PCR - diagnosis in the “pre - symptomatic” phase , e . g . in contact persons of COVID - 19 positive cases outside the school / day - care setting . Hence , ‘asymptomatic’ cases in the presented study may in fact just have spent less days of their infectious period in school / day - care , thus explaining the lower risk of transmission . At the same time , these findings do not support the prevailing fear that asymptomatic cases could play a major role in the transmission of COVID - 19 in schools / day - care under the current hygiene measures . One explanation for this finding , apart from shorter contact times due to ‘pre - symptomatic’ diagnosis , is a potential lower viral load in asymptomatic versus symptomatic cases . 29 This study has limitations . First , we do not have a full survey of notified cases in the context of educational institutions from all sixteen reporting DPHAs . This raises the question of selection bias . However , we advised DPHAs to report consecutive index cases over at least a 4 - week period or longer , thus reducing the chance of systematic under - or over - reporting of more or less salient index cases and associated under - or overestimation of transmission risk . Second , although all DPHAs routinely offer PCR tests to all contact persons to a COVID - 19 index case at high - risk of transmission in the educational setting , 44 % of our sample came from DPHAs that had outsourced sampling and testing to community testing centres . From these DPHAs , we received reliable information on secondary cases , but not on total contact persons and contact persons tested , since only positive test results are notifiable by testing - centres and associated laboratories . However , comparing the mean number of secondary cases between both samples shows similar results ( 0·39 versus 0·44 secondary cases per index case , data not shown ) , making us confident that these are from the same source population . Third , the proportion of PCR tests among contact persons from DPHAs organizing testing themselves decreased in November and December , presumably as a function of increasing incidence and associated workload . However , only an estimated 20 % of COVID - 19 cases generally stay asymptomatic during the course of infection 27 and all contact persons were monitored for disease symptoms . Thus , the 15 % missing PCR tests in contact persons in November would result in 3 % that could have become SARS - CoV - 2 positive without being detected , making us confident that this had only minor effects on the presented results . Finally , our study attributes all transmissions in children / students and teachers detected in contact persons to COVID - 19 index cases that were detected in educational settings to schools or day - care . This approach does not acknowledge that children / students and teachers may also have contact outside the institution , e . g . during leisure activities . This may have increased the .

In summary , we could show that on occurrence of an index case in an educational institution , the individual risk of acquiring SARS - CoV - 2 as a category - I contact person is about 1·3 % . This risk is significantly higher when teachers are index cases , mainly due to more common transmission between teachers . At the same time , there is lower risk of transmission between children / students , and only negligible risk for a transmission from children / students to teachers . We recommend increased attention to workplace safety in the educational setting with a focus on contact patterns between teachers in schools and day - care centres .

Figure displays number ( % ) of SARS - CoV - 2 cases notified in the Federal State of Rhineland - Palatinate by calendar week , overall , and among subjects ≤ 20 years of age . Figure 2 : Frequency of secondary cases in children and teachers by role of the index case . Graph displays frequency and role of 784 index cases and their association with secondary transmission to teachers and students / children in schools and day - care centres in Rhineland - Palatinate , Germany , 2020 . Grid position of circles represent the number of secondary cases in students / children ( x - axis ) and teachers ( y - axis ) . The circle size is proportional to the number of index cases with the respective number of secondary cases reported in this study . The colour inside the cirlce represents the share of children ( white ) and teachers ( black ) observed among index cases representd by that circle . Circles in areas of the grid with same shade of grey represent clusters of similar size . For instance , the black dot at the very top of the grid identifies one cluster of size 15 ( high cluster size = dark shade of grey ) that emerged from a teacher index case ( indicated by black colour vs . white colour of dot ) and produced 10 secondary cases in teachers ( position on y - axis ) and 5 in student / children ( position on x - axis ) . .
