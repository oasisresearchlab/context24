In this study , we re - examine the question of the growth of science . To do this we ( i ) use current data up to publication year 2012 and ( ii ) analyse it across all disciplines and also separately for the natural sciences and for the medical and health sciences . Furthermore , the data are analysed with an advanced statistical technique – segmented regression analysis – which can identify specific segments with similar growth rates in the history of science . The study is based on two different sets of bibliometric data : ( 1 ) The number of publications held as source items in the Web of Science ( WoS , Thomson Reuters ) per publication year and ( 2 ) the number of cited references in the publications of the source items per cited reference year . We have looked at the rate at which science has grown since the mid - 1600s . In our analysis of cited references we identified three growth phases in the development of science , which each led to growth rates tripling in comparison with the previous phase : from less than 1 % up to the middle of the 18th century , to 2 to 3 % up to the period between the two world wars and 8 to 9 % to 2012 . Key words growth of science ; bibliometrics ; cited references 3 1 Introduction Many studies in information science have looked at the growth of science ( Evans , 2013 ) . Tabah ( 1999 ) offers an overview of the literature which groups these studies under the label " the study of literature dynamics " ( p . 249 ) : “The information science approach is to follow the published literature and infer from the growth of the literature the movement of ideas and associations between scientists” ( Tabah , 1999 , p . 249 ) . Price ( 1965 ; 1951 , 1961 ) can undoubtedly be seen as a pioneering researcher on literature dynamics ( de Bellis , 2009 ) . Price analysed the references listed in the 1961 edition of the Science Citation Index ( SCI , Thomson Reuters ) and the papers collected in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London . His results show that science is growing exponentially ( in a certain period by a certain percentage rate ) and doubles in size every 10 to 15 years . The exponential growth in science established by Price has become today a generally accepted thesis which has also been confirmed by other studies ( Tabah , 1999 ) . In this study , we want to re - examine the question of the growth of science . To do this we will ( i ) use current data up to publication year 2012 and ( ii ) analyse it across all disciplines and also separately for the natural sciences and for the medical and health sciences . Furthermore , the data will be analysed with an advanced statistical technique – segmented regression analysis – which can identify specific segments with similar growth rates in the history of science . The study is based on two different sets of data : ( 1 ) The number of publications held as source items in the Web of Science ( WoS , Thomson Reuters ) per publication year and ( 2 ) the number of cited references in the publications of the source items per cited reference year ( Bornmann & Marx , 2013 ; Marx , Bornmann , Barth , & Leydesdorff , in press ) . The advantage of using cited references rather than source items is that they can give insight into the early period of modern science . There is no database available which covers publications ( source items ) from the early period . The disadvantage of using cited 4 references is that the literature which has not been cited yet is not considered . Furthermore , publishing in the early period is inferred by todays citing ( here : in the period from 1980 to 2012 ) . 2 Methods Publications are very suitable source of data with which to investigate the growth rates of science : “Communication in science is realized through publications . Thus , scientific explanations , and in general scientific knowledge , are contained in written documents constituting scientific literature” ( Riviera , 2013 , p . 1446 ) . Having a paper published in a journal is an integral part of being a scientist : “ [ It ] is a permanent record of what has been discovered , when and by which scientists – like a court register for science – [ and it ] shows the quality of the scientist’s work : other experts have rated it as valid , significant and original” ( Sense About Science , 2005 ) . Because “efficient research requires awareness of all prior research and technology that could impact the research topic of interest , and builds upon these past advances to create discovery and new advances” ( Kostoff & Shlesinger , 2005 , p . 199 ) , cited references in the publications are also an important source of data with which to examine scientific growth . An increase in the number of cited references indicates that there are more citing and / or cited publications . Our study is based on all the publications from 1980 to 2012 and the cited references in these publications . The data is taken from an in - house database belonging to the Max Planck Society ( Munich , Germany ) based on WoS . It was established and is maintained by the Max Planck Digital Library ( MPDL , Munich , Germany ) . As the data prepared by the MPDL relates to publications ( and their cited references ) since 1980 , it was only possible to include these publications ( and their cited references ) in the analysis . The first step in the study was to select all the publications ( all document types ) that appeared between 1980 and 2012 ( 38 , 508 , 986 publications ) and determine the number of publications per year . The 5 second step was to select the cited references in the publications from 1980 to 2012 and to determine the number of cited references per year ( from 1650 to 2012 ) ( 755 , 607 , 107 cited references in total ) . The annual number of publications or cited references formed the basis for the ( segmented ) regression analyses ( van Raan , 2000 ) – the third step in the analysis . Based on the annual number of publication , a growth model y ( t ) = b 0 * exp ( b 1 * ( t - 1980 ) ) was estimated by a nonlinear regression using SAS PROC NLIN ( SAS Institute Inc . , 2011 ) , where the intercept b 0 equals y ( 0 ) – the outcome in the year 1980 . The model converged : overall 96 % of the total variance of the annual number of publications could be explained by the regression model . Segmented regression analysis was used to determine different segments of growth development in the cited references within the annual time series ( Bornmann , Mutz , & Daniel , 2010 ; Brusilovskiy , 2004 ; Lerman , 1980 ; McGee & Carleton , 1970 ; Mutz , Guilley , Sauter , & Nepveu , 2004 ; Sauter , Mutz , & Munro , 1999 ; Shuai , Zhou , & Yost , 2003 ) . In the model estimations , the logarithmised number of cited references per year forms the dependent variable . In mathematical and statistical terms we assumed a simple exponential growth model which considers separate segments in the time series ( e . g . , a segment with a decline around both World Wars , WW ) . This model can be formulated as a differential equation f ` ( t ) = b 1 * f ( t ) where b 1 is the growth constant or the multiplication factor and t is the time ( cited reference year ) . The change f ( t ) in a period t 1 - t 0 is therefore proportional to the status at the starting point in time t 0 . The solution of the differential equation is an exponential function : y ( t ) = y ( 0 ) * exp ( b 1 * t ) . The growth rate in percent ( y ( t ) - y ( 0 ) ) / y ( 0 ) is exp ( b 1 ) - 1 . The doubling time is the amount of time required for an outcome to double in size ( t = ln ( 2 ) / b 1 ) . Logarithmising the function y ( t ) results in a linear function ln ( y ) = b 0 + b 1 * t with b 0 = log ( y ( 0 ) ) , the parameters of which can be estimated with a linear regression . In the segmented regression different segments can be identified with different regression coefficients , where both the breakpoints ( cited reference year ) a of the segments as 6 well as the growth constant b 1 of each segment is estimated . For example , let log _ y the logarithmic transformed annual number of cited references , ‘year’ the cited reference year , and a 1 / a 2 the breakpoints of differentiating three segments . Then , we need to estimate the unknown regression parameters b 0 , b 1 , b 2 and b 3 , and the breakpoints a 1 and a 2 by minimizing the following objective function – in particular the sum of squared residuals ( Brusilovskiy , 2004 , p . 2 ) : IF year < = a 1 THEN log _ y = b 0 + b 1 * year + ε ; ( 1 ) ELSE IF year < = a 2 THEN log _ y = b 0 + b 1 * a 1 + b 2 * ( year - a 1 ) + ε ; ELSE IF year < = a 3 THEN log _ y = b 0 + b 1 * a 1 + b 2 * ( a 2 - a 1 ) + b 3 * ( year - a 2 ) + ε ε ~ i . i . d . N ( 0 , I σ 2 ) In the function the residuals ε are assumed to be multivariate normally distributed with a zero mean vector and a covariance matrix with identical variances σ 2 ( homoscedasticity ) and zero covariance ( no autocorrelations of the residuals ) overall and across the segments . These are rather strong assumptions for time series data . Given the high proportion of explained variance ( low proportion of residual variance in this study ) and low standard errors , which we generally observed in the regression analyses , the violations of the assumptions were not considered with the risk of slightly higher standard errors . The model parameters were estimated by the least squares method ( Gauss - Newton ) under the restriction that the breakpoints a 1 , a 2 , … are ordered ( e . g . , 1690 < a 1 < a 2 < 2012 ) . In order to avoid local minima of the estimation procedure a grid of different starting values for the parameters was used . The regression constant b 0 was erased in our analysis to enhance the fit of the model . The following criteria were used to choose the number of segments : First , by visually inspecting the data it was obvious that the relationships are strongly linear with different slopes within three or four segments ( see , e . g . , Figure 2 ) . Second , statistical criteria were 7 used . In the case of least - squares estimations the amount of explained variance ( R 2 ) is the method of choice . In this study , models were selected , where the amount of explained variance no longer substantially increased . In other words , segmented regression models with three breakpoints could explain 99 % of the total variance of the annual number of references . Thus , it was possible to divide the series of the annual number of cited references in the time interval from 1650 to 2012 into four segments . Differences between disciplines ( natural sciences and medical and health sciences ) ( D ) regarding the slope parameters are tested by expanding equation 1 by corresponding interaction terms with disciplines ( e . g . , b 1 * D * year ) for each slope parameter ( b 1 , b 2 , b 3 , … ) . The disciplines were dummy - coded ( natural sciences : D = 0 , medical and health sciences : D = 1 ) . The statistical analyses were performed using the SAS procedure PROC NLIN ( SAS Institute Inc . , 2011 ) . 3 Results Figure 1 shows the exponential growth of global scientific publication output for the period 1980 to 2012 ( 33 years ) . While the dots represent the observed values , the predicted values are the result of the regression analysis . As the result of the segmented regression analysis ( Table 1 ) shows , the global scientific publication output is growing at a rate of approximately 3 % annually . The volume of publications doubles approximately every 24 years . A similar result – exponential growth of publications – is also reported by Pautasso ( 2012 ) for 18 biological sub - fields . However with the model in Table 1 we are looking at a relatively short and recent period of scientific activity in society . The analysis of cited references from the publications allows us to start the analysis of scientific activity much earlier . According to van Raan ( 2000 ) scientific evolution started “after the Scientific Revolution in 16th century Europe” ( p . 8 347 ) . However , van Raan ( 2000 ) starts the analysis of cited references considerably later , in 1800 . In this study , we start with the analysis of cited references in the middle of the 17th century . This period saw the development of the institutionalised structures of modern science with publication of the results of scientific work in journals and manuscripts undergoing critical peer review before publication ( Bornmann , 2011 ) . In peer review , active scientists in the same discipline review the scientific work of each other and decide on success and failure . The use of the peer review procedure since the middle of the 17th century is an important step towards an independent science system from other areas of society , for example from church ( Gould , 2013 ) . According to Popper ( 1988 ) we can assume that it is rational criticism – institutionalized as peer review procedures – driven by the idea of truth that characterises modern science . Gattei ( 2009 ) says that the " growth of knowledge and criticism are closely interconnected " ( p . 2 ) . Figure 2 shows the segmented growth of the annual number of cited references between 1650 and 2012 . The observed values and those predicted by the model are visualised . As Table 2 shows , regression analysis has identified four different segments with different growth rates : The first phase from 1650 to approximately 1750 is characterised by a relatively low growth rate of less than 1 % , with cited references doubling in 150 years approximately . It is followed by a phase with a growth rate of slightly less than 3 % which lasts until the period between WWI and WWII . Interestingly , these two segments identified by the regression analysis correspond to phases of economic growth and the start of the Industrial Revolution in Europe in about 1750 . " Pre - 1750 growth was primarily based on Smithian and Northian effects : gains from trade and more efficient allocations due to institutional changes . The Industrial Revolution , then , can be regarded not as the beginnings of growth altogether but as the time at which technology began to assume an ever - increasing weight in the generation of growth and when economic growth accelerated dramatically . An average growth rate of 0 . 15 – 9 0 . 20 % per annum , with high year - to - year variation and frequent setbacks was replaced by a much more steady growth rate of 1 . 5 % per annum or better” ( Mokyr , 2005 , p . 1118 ) . The second phase in Figure 2 is followed by a third phase with the strongest growth rate of approximately 8 % and which lasts to the start of the 21st century . Doubling time for cited references in this phase is approximately 9 years . The final phase has a negative growth rate . Around 1980 , the curve in Figure 2 starts to flatten off and then fall significantly : from 1980 , more publications are included in the regression analysis each year , which in many cases refer to publications which could not yet be cited in the previous year . The fourth segment therefore reflects " time - dependent database characteristics in , for instance , the registration of references " ( van Raan , 2000 , p . 348 ) . To establish in how far the use of all the publications since 1980 has an influence on the growth rate of science ( particularly in the last 30 years ) , we have extracted the annual growth rates of the cited references given in the publications for 2012 in Figure 3 . 1 , 859 , 648 publications ( from 2012 ) and 53 , 345 , 550 cited references between 1650 and 2012 were included in this analysis . As illustrated by a comparison of the results in Table 3 with the results in Table 2 the regression analysis identified four segments with different growth rates even though only one year was taken into account . While the growth rates for the medium and younger segment hardly differ , ( we are looking here at just the segments with a positive growth rate ) , when only one year is taken into account , the growth rate is much lower in the oldest segment than in the analysis of citing publications from 1980 to 2012 . By taking just one year into account , the number of cited references particularly in this segment falls as generally speaking , very old publications are rarely cited ( Marx , 2011 ) . In contrast to Figure 2 we see in Figure 3 an abrupt decline in the number of cited references from around 2010 . van Raan ( 2000 ) , who observes a similar fall a few years before 1998 in his data , explains this drastic decline thus : " It is well known , particularly in the natural science and medical fields , that publications of a given year ( here : 1998 ) have a peak in the distribution of their 10 references around the age of three years . Therefore , [ in the figure ] in the last three years the number of references will decrease” ( p . 350 ) . According to van Raan ( 2000 ) the growth rates in Figure 2 and Figure 3 reflect two processes : " ageing ( scientists will be increasingly less interested in increasingly older literature ) , and growth ( there were simply much less papers published in 1930 as there are in 1990 , so there is less to be cited to earlier years ) " ( p . 351 ) . Tabah ( 1999 ) also discusses these two processes in connection with growth in science ; they influence each other as described here : " Specifically , the faster a literature or even a given journal grows ( in terms of number of articles published per year ) , the more rapidly it ages " ( p . 250 , see also Egghe & Rousseau , 2000 ) . Similarly van Raan ( 2000 ) writes : " Although undoubtedly ageing of earlier published work is part of reality , another part of reality is that in earlier times there were many fewer documents published than in recent times . Thus , the time - dependent distribution of references will always be a specific combination of the ageing and growth phenomena of science , or better said : of scientific literature " ( pp . 347 - 348 ) . In earlier analyses of the growth rate of science , the time before , between and WWI and WWII has been of particular interest ( Larsen & von Ins , 2010 ; Price , 1965 ; van Raan , 2000 ) . In conformity with our results , other studies have also shown a significant fall in the number of cited references during this period . Furthermore , this and other studies , as van Raan ( 2000 ) writes , also show that the two dips are " immediately followed by an astonishing ‘recovery’ of science after the wars toward a level more or less extrapolated from the period before the wars " ( p . 347 ) . However the results for the period between WWI and WWII , from around 1920 to 1935 , revealed some inconsistencies : " In Price’s analysis this period shows a ‘hill’ when extrapolating the exponential increase of the pre - World War I period . This ‘hill’ has almost disappeared in our analysis " ( van Raan , 2000 , p . 349 ) . Like Price ' s , our study shows that a significant increase in the number of cited references in the period between the wars has several consequences , one of which is that the third segment with a growth rate of 11 around 8 % ( see Table 2 ) does not begin in the ' Big Science ' period ( see above ) , but a few years earlier . According to our data , WWII is only a temporary low point in the significant growth of science since the period between the wars . In our final analysis we looked at the extent to which we could determine whether there were differences between growth rates in different disciplines . The main categories of the Organisation for Economic Co - operation and Development ( 2007 ) ( OECD ) were used as a subject area scheme for this study . A concordance table between the OECD categories and the WoS subject categories is provided by InCites ( Thomson Reuters ) ( see http : / / incites - help . isiknowledge . com / live / globalComparisonsGroup / globalComparisons / subjAreaSchemes Group / oecd . html ) . The OECD scheme enables the use of six broad subject categories for WoS data : ( 1 ) natural sciences , ( 2 ) engineering and technology , ( 3 ) medical and health sciences , ( 4 ) agricultural sciences , ( 5 ) social sciences , and ( 6 ) humanities . However , neither the numbers for engineering and technology nor those for the social sciences and humanities were included in this study . According to the Council of Canadian Academies ( 2012 ) , the usefulness of citation impact indicators depends on the extent to which the research outputs are covered in bibliometric databases , and this coverage varies by subject category . The coverage tends to be high in the natural and life sciences , which place a high priority on journal publications . In engineering , the social sciences and humanities , where the publication of books , book chapters , monographs , conference proceedings etc . is more traditional , the extent of the coverage is reduced ( Lariviere , Gingras , & Archambault , 2006 ) . We therefore undertook discipline - specific analyses for the natural sciences and the medical and health sciences . 15 , 435 , 641 publications from 1980 to 2012 and corresponding 379 , 294 , 777 cited references from 1650 to 2012 were included in the analyses for the natural sciences . The corresponding figures for the medical and health sciences were 12 , 796 , 558 publications and 256 , 164 , 353 cited references . The results of the analyses are shown in Figure 4 , Figure 5 , Table 4 , and Table 5 . The results are very similar . The regression analysis 12 identified 3 segments with interpretable content up to the beginning of the 21st century , with similar start and end points . Only the middle segment , which exhibits a higher level of scientific activity compared to the oldest segment , begins slightly earlier in the natural sciences than in the medical and health sciences ( in 1720 rather than 1750 ) . Furthermore , the growth rates in the medical and health sciences since the 18th century have been minimally higher than in the natural sciences . The doubling times in the medical and health sciences are correspondingly slightly lower than in the natural sciences . The results of the regression analysis in which the interaction terms with disciplines are included confirm the similarities . The interaction effects ( results are not shown here ) disciplines × publication years for each segment are statistically significant , but they are too small to justify any statements about real differences between the disciplines . The statistical significance results ( more or less ) from the high proportion of explained variance and the associated very low standard errors of the parameters . 4 Discussion In this study we have looked at the rate at which science has grown in terms of number of publications and cited references since the mid - 1600s . In our analysis we identified three growth phases in the development of science , which each led to growth rates tripling in comparison with the previous phase : from less than 1 % up to the middle of the 18th century , to 2 to 3 % up to the period between the two world wars and 8 to 9 % to 2012 . As the growth rate of the cited references in the third segment is significantly higher than that based on the source segments in this study ( approximately 3 % ) , we can assume that WoS only covered a small part of the total publications . We can further suppose that the number of early publications is underestimated and the publications’ growth rate is overestimated in the cited reference analysis because of aging ( see above ) . van Raan ( 2000 ) reports , based on analyses of cited references , a growth rate of around 10 % for the period from 1800 to the mid - 1990s . 13 We can only confirm this result for the last 70 years ( and not for the last 200 years ) . However , when considering the studies by Price ( 1965 ) and by van Raan ( 2000 ) and our study , it should be noted that scientific growth since the beginning of modern science has not been measured directly with the publication volume , but indirectly with the number of cited references . Unfortunately , there is currently no literature database containing every publication since the beginning of modern science to today and which can be used for statistical analysis . Our results support estimates such as those made in a comment piece by Frazzetto ( 2004 ) about the far - reaching changes that have taken place in science over the last century : “Without doubt , science has put on a new face in the past century . It has come to occupy a central role in society and now enjoys a privileged position among the knowledge - producing disciplines . As a consequence , the resources devoted to science have increased hugely . There has also been , in general , a visible shift in the way in which science is organized and in how it produces knowledge . Science has become ‘big’ , global and complex … and the emphasis has shifted from the individual scientist to collaborative work . Similarly , scientific knowledge production has become more costly , and forms of funding have subsequently changed , with industry and venture capital now providing the bulk of financial resources” ( Frazzetto , 2004 , p . 19 ) . An end to this development cannot be foreseen ( with new highly - productive players such as China and India moving swiftly into the science community ) . Finally , we would like to mention three limitations of our study : The first limitation concerns the use of publications to measure scientific growth . There are advantages and disadvantages to using this data , as described by Tabah ( 1999 ) : “Although counting publications is simple and relatively straightforward , interpretation of the data can create difficulties that have in the past led to severe criticisms of bibliometric methodology … The main problems concern the least publishable unit ( LPU ) , disciplinary variance , variance in quality of work , and variance in journal quality” ( p . 264 ) . Publications 14 are not singular entities that have static forms . Publication practices differ , not only between disciplines , but also within disciplines . Publication numbers and both publishing styles as well as citing styles have developed through history ( de Bellis , 2009 ) . Add to this the explosion in publishing numbers linked to external factors in the past decades , related to the “Audit Society” and “New Public Management” , with “salami sliced publishing” , and the notion of “least publishable unit” ( Bornmann & Daniel , 2007 ) . Not to mention that at least during the first 100 years of publishing in Philosophical Transactions , it was not the scientists that published their work , but the editor , that received letters of talks read to the community that were published . There is of course the option of using other data than publications to measure scientific growth such as the number of scientists . However , as a rule this other data is not more suitable than bibliometric data as it has its own limitations ( for example , there is no database that can provide reliable information about the number of scientists practising modern science since its beginnings to this day ) . The second limitation refers to the view of “growth” as an “increase in numbers” ( publications , cited references , or scientists ) . This study views science through an internal perspective , where all differences are expected to be the result of internal aspects of a static research practice in “modern science” , as opposed to a mixture of internal ( analytic ) practices and external ( sociological , historical , psychological ) practices that continuously have altered the ways of viewing science in the same four centuries that this study focuses on . Furthermore , it is not clear whether an “increase in numbers” is directly related to an “increase of actionable knowledge” , for example for reducing needs , extending our knowledge about nature in some lasting way or some other “higher purposes” ( Bornmann , 2012 , 2013 ) . The third limitation concerns the database used here : WoS . According to van Raan ( 2000 ) “characteristics of the instruments ( in this case : the database ) will also be reflected in the measurements . Even worse , characteristics of databases may change in the course of time” 15 ( p . 348 ) . The WoS ( or the SCI ) has been in operation for several decades and has changed over the years . For example , the coverage of journals has been extended . The growth of science is not the only explanation for an increasing number of publications in the data , as Michels and Schmoch ( 2012 ) note : " By subdividing the journals into different categories , it was possible to distinguish which increases are related to a growth of science and which to the database provider’s policy of achieving a broader coverage of journals . The number of articles in the observation period [ 2000 - 2008 ] grew by 34 percent in total , a remarkable increase for this short period . If the number of articles in the categories ‘start’ and ‘new’ , which represent the growth of science , are added together , the growth rate in this period is 17 percent” ( p . 841 ) . As this study is mainly based on an analysis of cited references , we are assuming that the changes of the database characteristics do not exert a major influence on the results . As we have shown , even substantial changes to the data , such as limiting it to one year or one field in the citing papers , does not have a significant influence on the results arrived at with the cited references . 16 Acknowledgements The data used in this paper is from a bibliometrics database developed and maintained by the Max Planck Digital Library ( MPDL , Munich ) and derived from the Science Citation Index Expanded ( SCI - E ) , Social Sciences Citation Index ( SSCI ) , Arts and Humanities Citation Index ( AHCI ) prepared by Thomson Reuters ( Scientific ) Inc .
