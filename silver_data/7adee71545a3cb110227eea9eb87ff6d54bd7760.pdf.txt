However , there has been no consensus regarding the optimal conditions for vascu - larization , including macropore size , shape , interconnection , and the arrangement of macropores , due to the failure to accurately control porous structure of biomaterials . To investigate the effect of the porous structure parameters on vascularization of the biomaterials , an accurate control of these parameters is required . In this study , porous b - tricalcium phosphate ( b - TCP ) with accurately controlled pore parameters is fabricated by using assembled organic microspheres as templates combined with casting technique . Using this technique , we pro - duced a series of disk - type b - TCP with variable pore sizes and variable interconnections to evaluate the inﬂuence of macropore size and interconnection on the vascularization of bioceramic material in vivo . The vascularization of b - TCP implanted in the rabbit model is evaluated by histomorphology and single photon emission computed tomography . The results showed that the pore parameters affect not only the size of the blood vessels growing into the porous structure but also the number of blood vessels formed in the pores of the bioceramic . The increase in pore size only resulted in an increase in size of the blood vessels growing into the macroporous of the bioceramic scaffolds . However , with the increase in size of interconnection , both the size and number of the blood vessels formed in the macroporous increased . Therefore , we conclude that the size of the interconnections is more im - portant for vascularization in the scaffold compared with the pore size . On the other hand , there was no signiﬁcant difference in vascularization in the scaffolds with pores size above 400 m m , and there was no marked increase in extent of vascularization with further increase in pore size above 400 m m , indicating that the upper limit of pore size for vascularization is 400 m m . Introduction A main step in tissue engineering is seeding living cells into porous materials to construct living tissues . 1 After implantation of tissue constructs , the transplanted cells as well as the native host cells that migrate into the scaffold depend on the transport of nutrients and waste products between the cells and the host tissue for survival . Since the transport in the ﬁrst stage is exclusively carried out by dif - fusion processes that can supply the cells with nutrients only at a distance < 200 m m from the nearest capillary in the sur - rounding tissue , the transplanted cells in central area of scaffolds frequently either fail to engraft or die rapidly due to oxygen deﬁciency , lack of nutrient , and inadequate removal of waste products . 2 So , it is very important for implanted tissue - engineered constructs , especially the implants of lar - ger size , to develop sufﬁcient vasculature rapidly in vivo . To increase the vascularization of tissue - engineered con - structs , several approaches have been employed such as ex vivo culturing of scaffolds with endothelial cells alone or in combination with ﬁbroblasts , the addition of angiogenic growth factors , and provision of a vascularized tissue ﬂap . 3 – 9 However , without appropriate porous structure for blood vessels formation in scaffold , the effectiveness of these appro - aches in angiogenesis in the transplants will be limited . 10 – 17 The pore size and interconnections between macropores as two important parameters of porous structure in the scaffolds are two essential factors for the promotion of blood vessel growth . 13 – 17 It has been shown that the length of time course and the depth of vascular ingrowth into the biomaterial scaffolds implanted may depend on their pore size . 12 , 16 , 17 It has also been noted in other studies that the interconnection between pores is a more critical factor for vascularization in biomaterial scaffolds rather than the pore size . 13 , 15 1 Department of Orthopaedics of XiJing Hospital , Fourth Military Medical University , Xi’An , P .

Further , most of these conclu - sions were based on the studies using materials with random pore geometry , wide range of porosity , and pores of various sizes with smaller interconnection due to the failure to accu - rately control the porous structure of the scaffolds . 12 , 13 , 15 , 17 , 18 So , there has been no consensus regarding the optimal porous structure for vascularization , and quantitative results from these studies are seldom obtained . In this study , we developed porous b - tricalcium phos - phate ( b - TCP ) with accurately controlled pore size and interconnections by using slip casting shaping and polyme - thylmethacrylate ( PMMA ) as porogen agent . The measured dimensions of macropores and interconnections were accu - rately controlled in the theoretical scope . Under the accurate control of the porous structure , we investigated the role of macropores and interconnections in vascularization of the porous scaffolds in vivo and determined the optimal porous structure for vascularization . Materials and Methods Fabrication of porous b - TCP bioceramics with different three - dimensional porous structure An organic scaffold was prepared to develop a porous structure as follows . PMMA balls are chemically combined together to manufacture an organic scaffold in the shape of a block . This chemical welding is ensured by acetone , which causes a slow superﬁcial dissolution of the individual poly - mer balls and allows the realization of bridges at the contact points between balls . This movement leads to the formation of necks between PMMA balls and a signiﬁcant shrinkage of the ball pile , which is correlated with the interconnection size between beads . To control the neck dimension between balls , the dimensional variation of the organic frame is continu - ously recorded during the chemical - forming treatment to correlate with the interconnection size between beads . To measure the shrinkage of the organic scaffold , caused by the PMMA ball coalescence , a piston precisely sliding in the metal mould is put into contact with the surface of the bed of balls , in its highest part . On the top of the piston , an elec - tronic displacement sensor is positioned , with a resolution to one micrometer ( Tesa Digico 11 Tesa ) , which records the movement of polymeric material . For different shrinkages , the chemical dissolution or bridging between balls is stopped by water action . Stoichiometric b - TCP powders for this study were synthesized by the reaction of a diammonium phos - phate solution ( NH 4 ) 2 HPO 4 and a calcium nitrate solution Ca ( NO 3 ) 2 (cid:2) 4H 2 O . The b - TCP aqueous slurries were poured into a plaster mold containing the polymeric frame and ﬁlled the voids between polymeric particles to obtain green disks with a diameter of 15 mm and a thickness of 4mm . To create macroporosity within the ceramic , the porogen agent ( PMMA ) was eliminated by a debinding treatment that was carried out at a low temperature after drying of the sample in the plaster mold . Heating to 220 8 C during 30h allows a large quantity of polymer to be burned . The residual organic is then eliminated by heating at 400 8 C for 5 h . After this debinding treatment , samples were sintered at 1100 8 C during 3 h to consolidate the ceramics . After sintering , the samples were cooled to room temperature in the furnace . The b - TCP disks were sterilized with ethylene oxide and sealed in a sterile package until use . The pore dimension of porous bioceramic scaffold was con - trolled by the initial choice of size of PMMA balls constituting the organic skeleton . The interconnection size was adjusted by the shrinkage amplitude of the ball pile during the chemical - forming treatment . Using this technique , two sets of disk - type porous b - TCP with different macropores size and intercon - nections were prepared ( shown in Table 1 ) . The ﬁrst set of scaffolds possessed the same interconnection of 120 m m , and the macropores varied from 300 to 700 m m ; the second series of scaffolds had the same macropore of 300 – 400 m m but different interconnection pathway from 70 to 200 m m . The porous struc - ture of the scaffold was observed and measured by SEM ( Shimadzu EPMA - 8705QHII ) and Micro - CT ( explore Locus SP ; GE ) . The porosity , the mean diameter of macropores , and interconnectionofporousbioceramicswerecalculatedbyusing the analysis software package ( Microview ABA 2 . 1 . 2 ; GE ) . 19 – 21 Surgical procedure Ninety - six New Zealand white rabbits with an average weight of 3 (cid:3) 0 . 5kg were randomly divided into eight groups according to the type of porous implants . The animals were housed in cages , in a sterile animal house , with free access to food and water . The rabbits were operated on under anesthesia by intravenous injection of 0 . 5mg / kg of Acepro - mazine Calmivet - Vetoquinol and 10mg / kg of Ketamine . A longitudinal incision about 3 . 0cm in length was made through full - thickness of the skin , and the paravertebral fascia lumbodorsalis abounding in blood vessels was exposed under sterile conditions . Subsequently , two pockets in bilateral peri - vertebral fascia lumbodorsalis were created by blunt dissec - tion . Two porous b - TCP blocks with same structure were Table 1 .

The antibiotics were intramuscularly administered twice in 3 days postoperatively . The rabbits were sacriﬁced at 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 weeks postoperatively , and the implanted b - TCP blocks were harvested . The animal experiment was in accordance with the Standing Committee on Ethics in China and carried out at the Laboratory for Animal Research of Research Institute of Orthopaedics in XiJing hospital afﬁliated to Fourth Military Medical University in China . Histological analysis After being bisected from tangential to the sagittal suture , specimens were ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate - buffered saline for 24 h . The specimens were decalciﬁed in 15 % EDTA for 3 weeks at 4 8 C . After being dehydrated in gradient series of ethanol ( 70 % * 100 % ) and cleared in toluene , the samples were embedded in parafﬁn ; then , 4 m m thick sec - tions were cut for hematoxylin – eosin staining . Histomorphometry Five sections of the central part from each sample were used for histomorphometric analysis . Images of the sections were taken with a Leica MTLA microscope connected with a CCD camera using the same light intensity and exposure . The mean blood vessels size and their number were obtained by randomly selecting six histological images in the central area and six ones in the peripheral area of every parafﬁn section at 10 (cid:4) magniﬁcation .

The area percentage of blood vessels was calculated as follows : the area percentage of blood vessels ( % ) ¼ ( area of newly formed blood vessels / area of implant ) (cid:4) 100 % . 6 , 22 Single photon emission computed tomography analysis Single photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) is a nondestructive method to observe and analyze the vascu - larization in bioceramics . 23 – 25 We observed blood ﬂow through the implant areas in the scaffolds by SPECT . At 2 , 4 , and 8 weeks after surgery , the rabbits were injected with 99m Tc - MDP ( 18 . 5MBq / kg ) through ear edge vein under se - dation as previously described in detail . 25 In 4h , the anesthe - tized rabbits remained stationary on a platform in the center of the system , whereas the X - ray unit and gamma cameras with a parallel - hole rotated around the platform . Static im - ages at scan speed 1 frame / 5min were obtained and stored in a 256 (cid:4) 256 matrix . The vascularization of the implants was analyzed by observing the regions of interest ( ROI ) radio - counting . ROI were drawn over the round implantation re - gion with 1 . 5cm diameter . Statistical analysis Results were expressed as mean (cid:3) standard deviation ( SD ) . Statistical software SPSS 11 . 0 was used to analyze the data by one - way analysis of variance . A Student’s t - test was also ap - plied on the data to assess the effect of macropore and inter - connection size at each implantation time . All results were considered to be signiﬁcant at the 5 % critical level ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Results The structural characterization of macroporous b - TCP bioceramics All b - TCP blocks represented similar macrostructures , consisting of well - interconnected and regular spherical mac - ropores , but different in the diameter of macropores and in - terconnections between macropores . One to three small round pores representing the interconnections were observed in every spherical macropore ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . Figure 1 showed four kinds of macroporous bioceramics with macropore sizes of 300 – 400 , 400 – 500 , 500 – 600 , and 600 – 700 m m , respectively , in this study . The measured values of mean macropores dimen - sion were accurately controlled in the theoretical scope by the initial choice of size of PMMA balls constituting the organic skeleton ( Table 1 ) . The diameter of interconnection between macropores was adjusted by the shrinkage amplitude of the ball pile during the chemical - forming treatment . In this study , a series of scaffolds with the same macropore size of 300 – 400 m m but with different diameters of interconnection ranging from 70 to 200 m m were prepared ( Fig . 2 ) . The measured mean size of interconnections was also accurately controlled in the theoretical scope ( Table 1 ) . The estimated total porosity of all FIG . 3 .

However , the increase of the size of interconnections resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in porosity of scaffold . The relevant data were summarized in Table 1 . Light microscopic observation Inﬂammatory cellular response to the implants was mild around all the ceramic implants . On day 7 , a few small and immature blood capillaries with lots of red blood cells were observed in the peripheral macropores of all porous implants ( Fig . 3A ) . At 2 weeks after implantation , the ﬁbrous tissue inﬁltrated into more macropores of the scaffold and had a stronger and denser appearance . The blood vessels penetrat - ing the scaffolds were predominantly seen in the peripheral areas of the implants ( Fig . 3B ) . In contrast , the centre of the scaffold was still avascular with only a few single cells mi - grating along the macropores . Four weeks postoperatively , ﬁbrous tissue was seen in the central part of all the implants . The blood vessels were seen throughout the whole scaffolds . The blood vessels in the peripheral region were larger than those in the central region of the implanted b - TCP ( Fig . 3C ) . At 8 weeks after implantation , the peripheral areas of the im - planted b - TCP had signiﬁcantly degraded , having been re - placed with thick ﬁbrous tissue . Some capillaries in the peripheral areas of scaffold degenerated , but more blood ves - sels full of red cells were observed in the central area ( Fig . 3D ) . FIG . 4 .

The vascularization in implants showed difference histo - logically depending on the size of pore and interconnection between macropores of the scaffolds at 2 and 4 weeks after implantation . More blood capillaries were observed in disks with larger interconnections ( Fig . 4C – E ) compared with the scaffold with smaller interconnections ( Fig . 4A , B ) . The capil - laries in the scaffold with larger interconnections or macro - pores were larger in diameter ( Figs . 4D , E and 5B – D ) . Large blood vessels running through several consecutive macro - pores were observed in the scaffold with larger macropores size ( Fig . 5D ) or interconnections size ( Fig . 4E ) . We seldom observed large capillaries in the scaffolds with smaller mac - ropores ( Fig . 5A ) or interconnections ( Fig . 4A , B ) . Histomorphometric analysis The amount of blood vessels formed in implants . It was noticed that the number of blood vessels increased within the ﬁrst 4 weeks in all samples and then become stabilized . There was no signiﬁcant change in amount of capillaries from 4 to 8 weeks ( p > 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 6A , B ) . No signiﬁcant difference in the number of vessels was shown within all kinds of scaffolds by 1 week ( p > 0 . 05 ) . At 2 , 4 , and 8 weeks , the increase in inter - connections size resulted in a statistically signiﬁcant increase in the number of blood vessels formed ( p < 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 6A ) . More blood vessels formed in the scaffolds with larger inter - connections than in those with smaller interconnections . The amount of blood vessels formed in implants with different interconnection size was in the following decreasing order : 200 , 150 , 120 , 100 , and 70 m m . The Student’s t - test showed some signiﬁcant differences between the various intercon - nection sizes . The samples with interconnection size of 200 m m had signiﬁcantly more blood vessels than other samples with interconnection size of 150 120 , 100 , and 70 m m ( p < 0 . 01 ) . The difference between 150 and 100 m m was signiﬁcant at p < 0 . 05 . The samples with interconnection size of 70 m m had signiﬁ - cantly less blood vessels than other samples with larger in - terconnections ( p < 0 . 01 ) . Only the difference between 100 and 120 m m at 2 weeks as well as 120 and 150 m m at 4 weeks wasnot signiﬁcant at p > 0 . 05 . Overall , there was a signiﬁcant effect of interconnection size on the number of blood vessels formed . However , variations in pore size with invariable intercon - nections did not affect the number of the blood vessels formed within the macroporous structure as much as the variation in interconnections itself ( Fig . 6B ) . At only 2 weeks , the number of blood vessels in the scaffold with macropore size above 400 m m in was higher than that in the scaffolds with macropore size 300 – 400 m m . However , the difference was either not or only marginally signiﬁcant , indicating that the macropore size has only limited impact on the amount of blood vessels formed at 2 weeks . At 4 and 8 weeks , no signiﬁcant difference in the number of the blood vessels was observed between the sam - ples with pores of different size but invariable size of inter - connections ( p ¼ 0 . 102 ) ( Fig . 6B ) .

From Figure 6C , we can see that the mean size of the blood vessels increased with the increase in size of the interconnections ( p < 0 . 01 ) . Larger blood vessels ( diameter (cid:5) 100 m m ) were only seen in the scaffold with interconnections above 100 m m in size ( Fig . 4C – E ) . The increase in macropore size with unchanged interconnections did not affect the mean size of blood vessels formed on condition that the diameter of macropores is larger than 400 m m ( p > 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 6D ) . On the other hand , when the diameter of pores was smaller than 400 m m , the mean size of blood vessels dramatically decreased ( p < 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 6D ) . In the b - TCP bioceramics with macropore size above 400 m m , larger blood vessels ( diameter (cid:5) 100 m m ) were observed ( Fig . 5B – D ) . Moreover , the vessels in size of * 200 m m were spo - radically seen in the peripheral area of the scaffold with macropores 600 – 700 m m in size ( Fig . 5D ) . The area percentage of newly formed blood vessels in scaffold . The area percentage of blood vessels is affected by the amount and size of blood vessels , thus this parameter can represent the extent of vascularization of the implanted scaffolds . Figure 6E and F showed that the area percentage of blood vessels in all scaffolds displayed a signiﬁcant increase within the ﬁrst 4 weeks ( p < 0 . 001 ) , but nonsigniﬁ - cant change in the area of vessels in all implants was ob - served from 4 to 8 weeks . The size of both the macropores and interconnections affected the area percentage of blood vessels . It is clear that the percentage area of newly formed blood vessels in porous b - TCP bioceramics with larger di - ameter interconnections ( 150 and 200 m m , respectively ) ( Fig . 6E ) or larger diameter macropores ( 400 – 500 , 500 – 600 , and 600 – 700 m m , respectively ) ( Fig . 6F ) was remarkably higher than that of the samples with smaller diameter FIG . 6 .

SPECT ﬁndings Two weeks postoperatively , indistinct radioactivity visual - ization was observed in all groups after intravenous injection 99m Tc - MDP . At 4 and 8 weeks , radioactivity visualization in the implantation region was clearer than that visualized at 2 weeks ( Fig . 7 ) . Figure 8 showed that the ROI radiocounting in the region of implanted scaffold signiﬁcantly increased within 4 weeks of implantation in all scaffolds ( p < 0 . 01 ) , but nonsigniﬁcant change in the ROI radiocounting in all im - plants was observed from 4 to 8 weeks . The ROI radio - counting ( Fig . 8A ) and intensity of radioactivity visualization ( Fig . 7A – E ) signiﬁcantly increased with the increase in size of the interconnections ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Pore size also affected the ROI radiocounting ( Fig . 8B ) and intensity of radioactivity visualization ( Fig . 7C , F , G ) . At 2 and 4 weeks , the ROI radiocounting and intensity of radioactivity visualization were higher in the groups of scaffolds with pore size above 400 m m compared with the groups of scaffolds with pore size of 300 – 400 m m ( p < 0 . 01 ) . However , there was no signiﬁcant difference in the ROI radiocounting when the diameter of pores was larger than 400 m m ( p > 0 . 05 ) . At 8 weeks , some - what higher ROI radiocounting was observed in the scaffold with pore size 400 – 500 m m and interconnection size 120 m m than in other scaffolds , but the difference between these groups are not signiﬁcant ( p > 0 . 05 ) . The SPECT results were similar to those from histologic analysis . Discussion Three - dimensional porous biomaterials have been exten - sively used as scaffolds in the ﬁeld of tissue engineering for in vitro study of cell – scaffold interactions and tissue synthesis and in vivo study of induced tissue and organ regeneration . So , preparing an ideal biomaterial as a scaffold is a key procedure in tissue engineering . The b - TCP has been shown to have good biocompatibility and osteoconductivity in both animal experiments and clinical settings . 26 – 29 The chemical composition of b - TCP is near the bone . Moreover , the re - sorbability of b - TCP allows a gradual biological degradation over a period of time and a progressive replacement by the natural host tissue . 30 This property imparts signiﬁcant advan - tages onto b - TCP compared with other biomedical materials , which are not resorbed and replaced by natural bone . 31 Our previous study showed that pure b - TCP was completely resorbed at skeletal sites over 24 weeks . 15 The degradation rate of pure b - TCP can meet the requirement of bone repair . So , pure b - TCP was chosen as a matrix in this study . Besides the chemical composition , the other critical property to improve the efﬁciency of biomaterials to be used in tissue engineering is the porous structure : pore shape , porosity , pore size , and pore interconnection pathway 13 , 15 , 16 – 18 , 32 – 37 Previous studies have shown that porous structure which is indepen - dent of the material may directly or indirectly affect the bio - logical properties of the scaffolds . 32 – 37 For example , porous network of scaffold could promote cell attachment , pro - liferation , and differentiation and allow tissue to grow in the scaffold . 16 – 18 , 32 – 35 It is more noticeable that the porous archi - tectural characteristics of materials have a profound effect on the vascularization postimplantation , which provides the ba - FIG . 7 .

THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE AND VASCULARIZATION 3799 T i ss u e E ng i n ee r i ng P a r t A 2010 . 16 : 3791 - 3803 .

Several studies have shown that appropriate internal structure of scaffold can allow the nutrients to inﬁltrate and provide pathways for new blood vessels ingrowth . 12 , 13 , 15 – 18 , 38 So , consideration must be given to appropriate design of the po - rous structure in tissue reconstruction . Optimal structural parameters may be different in different tissue engineering applications , which need to be considered in the design of the scaffolds . Pore and interconnection be - tween adjacent pores as two critical structural parameters of biomaterials have been shown to have a strong impact on cell processes and , subsequently , in the guidance of tissue forma - tion . 13 , 15 – 18 , 32 – 35 However , the effect of the two critical struc - tureparameters on vascularization has not been systematically investigated . Although there are a few reports in literature indicating a beneﬁcial effect on vascularization for macropore and interconnection , 13 , 15 , 17 , 18 it is still not completely clear how these parameters are able to inﬂuence the efﬁciency of the process of blood vessels formation . Moreover , there has been no consensus regarding the optimal porous structure for vascularization ; and no quantitative conclusions have been reached owing to failureto accurately control porous structure . To evaluate the effect of a single structural parameter on the biologicalproperties of biomaterials , other parameters must be kept identical while evaluating different biomaterials . Most of previous conclusions were based on studies using scaffolds with random pore geometry , wide ranges of porosity , and pores of various sizes with smaller interconnections or even without interconnection pathway . Therefore , an accurate control of porous structure is required to investigate the effect of pore parameters on the vascularization of biomaterials , and this is a big challenge in the fabrication of the porous bio - ceramics . Solid freeform fabrication or rapid prototyping technique and slip casting shaping technique in the present study all allow for precise control of the internal pore struc - tures of biomaterial and , in particular , of the pore size and their interconnection , which condition the clinical effectiveness of biomaterial . Our fabrication method allows for macropore and interconnection sizes to be unequal . The macropore and in - terconnection sizes of porous scaffolds can be controlled in different dimensions , respectively , by using our method ac - cording to the different applications . However , solid freeform fabrication or rapid prototyping allows for macropore and interconnection sizes to be equal in that the two are essentially the same . 39 , 40 In the present study , the bioceramic scaffolds with high porosity and accurately controlled porous structure weresuccessfullyfabricated to overcome the limitations due to imprecise structural characteristics . The diameter of the pores and interconnection between pores were accurately controlled by using slip casting shaping technique and PMMA as poro - gen agent . Using this technique , we produced a series of disk - type porous b - TCP with variable pore sizes and variable interconnections that may facilitate blood vessels ingrowth . Each scaffold had a consistent pore structure and showed no signiﬁcant variation in mean pore size , mean interconnection size , structure , or alignment at separate points within the scaffold , indicating the homogeneity of the scaffolds pro - duced . The results of SEM and micro - CT examination showed that the mean size of pores and interconnections of porous b - TCP prepared were accurately controlled in the theoretical scope . Above all , the precisely controlled parameters guaran - tee the rationality of the present study as concerned with the effect of the two structural parameters on blood vessels for - mation in b - TCP bioceramic . In this study , all scaffolds were implanted in rabbit fascia lumbodorsalis that abounds in blood vessels to evaluate the role of pore size and interconnection in the guidance of blood vessels formation . Based on the results obtained , we can ﬁnd some general rules on vascularization of the porous b - TCP : ( 1 ) The vascularization in all types of scaffolds signiﬁcantly improve with duration of implantation . Only a few imma - ture blood capillaries are formed in peripheral macropores of all porous implants on 7 days . From 2 weeks postopera - tively , the mean size and total number of blood vessels begin to signiﬁcantly increase , indicating that it is a key time for vascularization . Four weeks postoperatively , capillaries inﬁl - trate the central macroporous of all implants . The mean size and total number of blood vessels in the implants reached a peak at this time point and then stablilized , indicating that the vascularization of porous b - TCP had ﬁnished at this time point . 41 ( 2 ) Most of the newly formed blood vessels are capillaries that were composed of only a single layer of en - dothelial cells . Microvessels with smooth muscle were not seen in all pores . ( 3 ) Capillaries in the peripheral region are more abundant , larger , and more mature than those in the central region of the implanted b - TCP . FIG . 8 .

F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y . The extent of vascularization in the implants showed some variations depending on the size of pores and interconnection between macropores of scaffolds since 2 weeks postimplan - tation . These two structural parameters affect not only the size of the blood vessels growing into the porous structure but also the number of blood vessels formed . The number of the blood vessels signiﬁcantly increased with the increase of intercon - nections size , whereas the increase in pore size with invariable interconnections did not affect the number of the blood vessels as much as the size of interconnections . It is also noticed that the number of blood vessels increased within the ﬁrst 4 weeks in all samples and then become stabilized , suggesting that the number of the blood vessels was mainly determined by the size of the interconnections in the ﬁrst 4 weeks after implantation . Similar to the effect on the number of newly formed blood vessels , the increase in the size of interconnections also re - sulted in an increase in the size of the blood vessels . Larger blood vessels running through several consecutive pores were observed in the scaffold with interconnections larger than 120 m m in diameter . From the above results , we can see that the scale of interconnections appeared to limit the size of blood vessels running through the adjacent pores . This ﬁnding is consistent with the work of Maddalena et al . , who thought that the interconnection pathway could limit the vascularization of bioceramics , representing a bottleneck for blood vessel invasion . 13 The pore size also affects the diam - eter of newly formed blood vessels in the scaffold . There might be larger space for blood vessels formation in large pores from onset . The mean size of blood vessels exhibited a signiﬁcant increase with the increase in the pore size when the pore size was smaller than 400 m m . However , the increase in the pore size did not affect the mean size of the blood vessels when pore size was larger than 400 m m . This ﬁnding suggests that larger macropore size is beneﬁcial for ingrowth of blood vessels , and the diameter of macropores smaller than 400 m m limits the ingrowth of blood vessels , resulting in blood vessels of smaller diameter . An interesting observation was that the newly formed blood vessels such as rosary ran through several adjacent pores in the scaffolds with larger pores size and intercon - nections , and their lumen was smaller in the interconnection pathway , whereas the vessels enlarged after extending into the pores of larger size . This ﬁnding also indicated that both the pores and interconnection pathway could limit the size of blood vessels formed . This phenomenon is understandable , the macropores mainly provide the space for the growth of the blood vessels , whereas the interconnections are func - tioning as the door for ingrowth of the blood vessels , so that their size determine the size and number of the blood vessels which were allowed to grow into the macropores . It is , thus , evident that the interconnection is very important for blood vessels formation in the scaffold . 13 , 15 Through evaluating the area percentage of newly formed blood vessels , we identiﬁed the extent of vascularization of the scaffolds implanted . We also observed dynamic vascu - logenesis in the scaffold by SPECT . The results of SPECT conﬁrmed the conclusion from histomorphometric in this study . From the results obtained , we noticed an important effect of interconnection size on the extent of vascularization in bioceramics . The extent of vascularization in scaffolds continuously and signiﬁcantly increased with the increase in size of interconnections ; however , this did not occur with further increase of the pore size above 400 m m . Only when the diameter of macropores was smaller than 400 m m , the ex - tent of vascularization dramatically increased with the in - crease in pore size . In other words , 400 m m of the pore size is the upper limit to extension of the vasculature . Conclusions The present study clearly demonstrated that macropore size and interconnection play an important role in vascu - larization of the bioceramic with accurately controlled po - rous structure . Pore interconnection is directly related to the number of newly formed vessels , as it provides the way for the ingrowth of blood vessels . Both the pore size and inter - connection pathway affect the diameter of blood vessels . The macropore mainly provides the space for the newly formed blood vessels , and the interconnection is functioning as the door for the ingrowth of blood vessel ; thus , their sizes de - termine the diameter of the blood vessels inﬁltrated through the macropores in scaffold . Interconnection is more impor - tant for the vascularization in scaffold compared with pore size , because interconnection determines both the number and size of blood vessels . In this study , there was no sig - niﬁcant difference in the vascularization when the diameter of pores was larger than 400 m m , indicating that the upper limit of pore size for vascularization is 400 m m . These results may be referenced on the design of optimal porous structure of scaffolds to meet the speciﬁcity of vascularization in tis - sue - engineered construct in vivo . Of course , the optimization of scaffold macropore size and interconnection size alone is not enough to ensure sufﬁcient neovascularization for a large size bone defect that is treated with the scaffold . Other ad - ditional factors such as cells or proteins are necessary to ensure sufﬁcient neovascularization .
