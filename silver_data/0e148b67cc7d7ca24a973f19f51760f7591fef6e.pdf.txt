However , low statistical power is problematic in neurop - sychological research involving clinical populations and novel interventions for which avail - able sample sizes are often limited . One notable example of this problem is evident in the literature regarding the cognitive sequelae of deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) of the subtha - lamic nucleus ( STN ) in persons with Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) . In the current review , a post hoc estimate of the statistical power of 30 studies examining cognitive effects of STN DBS in PD revealed adequate power to detect substantial cognitive declines ( i . e . , very large effect sizes ) , but surprisingly low estimated power to detect cognitive changes associa - ted with conventionally small , medium , and large effect sizes . Such wide spread Type II error risk in the STN DBS cognitive outcomes literature may affect the clinical decision - making process as concerns the possible risk of postsurgical cognitive morbidity , as well as conceptual inferences to be drawn regarding the role of the STN in higher - level cognitive functions . Statistical and methodological recommendations ( e . g . , meta - analysis ) are offered to enhance the power of current and future studies examining the neuropsychologi - cal sequelae of STN DBS in PD . INTRODUCTION Despite myriad notable limitations to null hypothesis testing ( Cohen , 1994 ; Donders , 2000 ) , this traditional approach to statistical analysis remains decidedly prevalent in psychological research . As such , consideration of statistical power is critical for investigators and research consumers alike . Statistical power refers to Address correspondence to : Steven Paul Woods , Psy .

Power is dependent on four primary factors : ( a ) the sample size ; ( b ) the critical alpha level ( 0 . 05 by convention ) ; ( c ) the effect size observed ( or anticipated ) in the population of interest ; and ( d ) the specific statistical procedure being used . As a general rule , power values increase with larger sample sizes , stronger effects , higher critical alpha levels , and the use of tests that control more aspects of error variance . In other words , one is more likely to accurately reject a null hypothesis in a study with a large sample and liberal critical alpha level in which substantial effect sizes are evident ( Hallahan & Rosenthal , 1996 ) . The generally accepted convention for adequate power is 0 . 80 ( range ¼ 0 , 1 ) , which indicates that there is an 80 % prob - ability that the null hypothesis will be rejected when true effects are present ( Cohen , 1992 ) . Power values below 0 . 80 increase one’s risk of committing a Type II error ( i . e . , not rejecting the null hypothesis when true population differences are present ) . Cohen ( 1988 ) and a multitude of subsequent prominent investigators ( e . g . , Wilk - inson & the American Psychological Association’s Task Force on Statistical Inference , 1999 ) have urged behavioral scientists to perform power analyses to determine an appropriate sample size given the particular study design and hypothesized effects . Despite such longstanding recommendations and the increasing availability of resources and tools for its calculation , statistical power is not widely reported in pub - lished psychological research ( e . g . , Rossi , 1990 ; Sedlmeier & Gigerenzer , 1989 ) . The conspicuous absence of power analyses has prompted numerous investigators over the past 30 years to conduct post hoc power analyses of specific psychological litera - tures . For example , systematic post hoc power reviews are available for psychotherapy ( e . g . , Kazantzis , 2000 ) and rehabilitation counseling ( e . g . , Kosciulek & Szymanski , 1993 ) outcomes , health psychology ( e . g . , Maddock & Rossi , 2001 ) , and projective per - sonality assessment ( e . g . , Acklin , McDowell , & Orndoff , 1992 ) . By and large , such power reviews reach the same general conclusion : Insufficient power remains a wide spread problem in psychological research ( Cohen , 1992 ; Sedlmeier & Gigerenzer , 1989 ) . In fact , the failure to consider power has been proposed as one of the ‘‘seven deadly sins’’ of statistical practice in clinical neuropsychology ( Millis , 2003 ) . In a recent systematic review of the neuropsychological literature , Bezeau and Graves ( 2001 ) conducted post hoc power analyses of 66 articles from the 1998 and 1999 issues of Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology , Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society , and Neuropsychology . Consistent with other recent power analyses performed in the psychological literature ( Maddock & Rossi , 2001 ; Sedlmeier & Gigerenzer , 1989 ) , neuropsychological research generally demonstrated insufficient power to detect small and medium effect sizes . However , the median observed population effect size for the neuropsychological articles was large ( Cohen’s d ¼ 0 . 91 ) and corresponded to an ample median power estimate of 0 . 93 . The authors concluded that neuropsychological research typically addresses larger effect sizes than are documented in general psychological research , which may therefore allow for the use of smaller sample sizes . Although they provide critical and informative data , statistical power reviews of broad literatures such as provided by Bezeau and Graves ( 2001 ) may not effec - tively generalize to specific populations and = or hypotheses ( Rossi , 1990 ) . Statistical power is particularly problematic in neuropsychological studies involving clinical populations that are difficult to recruit and enroll in research protocols . For 28 STEVEN PAUL WOODS ET AL . example , small samples sizes are endemic to studies involving persons with localized brain lesions , low base rate neurological and medical conditions ( e . g . , prion diseases ) , and = or who are undergoing novel treatment protocols ( e . g . , deep brain stimulation ) . In fact , interventional studies typically exhibit significantly lower power estimates than non - interventional studies , which is often tolerated given the novelty , potential clinical impact , and repeated - measures designs common to clinical trials ( Maddock & Rossi , 2001 ; Vickers , 2003 ) . Although the ethical and logistical factors underlying the smaller sample sizes in interventional studies are legitimate and difficult to circumvent , the resultant limitations on statistical power are nonetheless challenging . Neuropsychological findings derived from such small population samples are often - times contradictory and vary widely across published studies ( e . g . , Demakis , 2003 ) , which ultimately diminishes one’s ability to draw coherent clinical and conceptual inferences from the scientific literature ( e . g . , Cohn & Becker , 2003 ; Maxwell , 2004 ) . One notable example of this problem is evident in studies examining the cog - nitive effects of deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) of the subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) in persons with Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) . STN DBS is a functional neurosurgical pro - cedure developed to reduce the cardinal motor symptoms of PD ( e . g . , akinesia , rigid - ity , and tremor ) in treatment refractory patients . Briefly , the surgery involves the bilateral implantation of high - frequency stimulation , quadripolar electrodes into the STN of persons with PD . The electrodes are subsequently linked to a subcuta - neous pulse generator ( akin to a cardiac pacemaker ) that is implanted in the sub - clavicular area , which allows for outpatient adjustment of stimulation parameters ( i . e . , frequency , pulse width , and amplitude ) to maximize treatment efficacy ( Rizzone et al . , 2001 ) . A growing body of literature supports the effectiveness of STN DBS for ameliorating off - motor symptoms and dyskinesias , as well as reducing antiparkinso - nian medication dosages ( Limousin et al . , 1998 ; Pollak et al . , 2002 ) . The exact mech - anism by which STN DBS reduces the symptoms of PD is controversial , but the high - frequency stimulation procedure may inhibit neuronal activity ( e . g . , membrane hyperpolarization ) in the STN that , in turn , enhances the functioning of nigrostriatal motor output pathways ( see Dostrovsky & Lozano , 2002 , for a review ) . It has been proposed that STN DBS may minimize the risk of cognitive morbidity relative to other neuroanatomical targets ( e . g . , globus pallidus internus ) and surgical techniques ( e . g . , lesioning methods ) ( Van Horn , Schiess , & Soukup , 2001 ) . To this end , a recent qualitative review of 16 published studies provided tenta - tive support for the gross cognitive and neurobehavioral safety of STN DBS in PD ( Woods , Fields , & Tro¨ster , 2002 ) . Nevertheless , the median sample size of the STN DBS studies in that review was 10 ( range ¼ 1 – 63 , all single - group pretest – posttest designs ) , which raises the concern that this literature may possess inadequate power to detect significant adverse postsurgical cognitive changes . Limited statistical power—in even a small subset of studies—might also falsely increase the variability of STN DBS cognitive outcomes ( i . e . , adequately powered studies report adverse cog - nitive outcomes , whereas underpowered studies erroneously report no iatrogenic effects thereby resulting in increased variability in the literature ) . Indeed , inconsisten - cies persist across this literature regarding the extent and duration of possible changes in episodic memory , attention , and executive functions ( e . g . , verbal fluency ) after STN DBS . For example , several investigators observed postsurgical declines on mea - sures of verbal fluency , attention , and executive functions , perhaps mediated by the STATISTICAL POWER IN STN DBS 29 effects of stimulation on neighboring associative and limbic fronto - striato - thalamo - cortical pathways ( Woods et al . , 2002 ) . Yet the nature and extent of cognitive decrements after STN DBS is controversial as other studies report no change ( and even improvement ) in these same cognitive ability areas ( e . g . , Jahanshahi et al . , 2000 ) . Whether STN DBS is associated with incident cognitive impairment is a ques - tion of considerable clinical ( as well as conceptual ) relevance . Research indicates that cognitive impairment—a common feature of PD ( see Tro¨ster & Woods , 2003 for a review ) —is associated with greater difficulties independently managing one’s instru - mental activities of daily living ( IADLs ) ( e . g . , Cahn et al . , 1998 ) . Thus , even modest declines in executive or memory functions might be burdensome for patients who already evidence mild neuropsychological deficits prior to surgery ( n . b . , frank dementia is an exclusion criterion for a majority of surgical candidates ) . Accord - ingly , if limited statistical power in the STN DBS literature has masked significant postsurgical cognitive declines , such information would likely alter the informed consent process as regards the potential costs and benefits of surgery . In the absence of formal statistical power analyses , however , it is difficult to determine whether inadequate statistical power might have obscured important cognitive risks associa - ted with STN DBS and = or contributed to inconsistent cognitive outcomes in the literature . Therefore , the aim of the present study was to provide a post hoc estimate of the statistical power of the STN DBS cognitive outcomes literature . METHOD To identify the relevant published articles , key search terms ( e . g . , subthalamic nucleus , deep brain stimulation , cognitive , etc . ) were entered into the PsychINFO , PubMed , and ISI Web of Science electronic databases for the years 1997 to 2004 . In addition , references from articles reporting cognitive outcomes of STN DBS were reviewed to identify other papers of interest that may not have been indexed in the aforementioned databases . To be included in the current power review , an article must have used a repeated - measures design and at least one paired - samples group - level statistical analysis ( e . g . , a paired - samples t - test ) to examine the cognitive seque - lae of STN DBS in a sample of persons with PD . Studies that used single - and = or mixed comparison - group designs were included . We excluded review articles , single case studies , statement papers , investigations that used only animal subjects , and studies not published in English . The 30 articles that met study inclusion criteria were reviewed to determine whether power estimates or standardized effect sizes were reported ( Alegret et al . , 2001 ; Ardouin et al . , 1999 ; Berney et al . , 2002 ; Brusa et al . , 2001 ; Burchiel , Anderson , Favre , & Hammerstad , 1999 ; Daniele et al . , 2003 ; Dujardin , Defebvre , Krystkowiak , Blond , & Destee , 2001 ; Funkiewiez et al . , 2003 , 2004 ; Gironell , Kulisevsky , Fortuny , Garcia - Sanchez , & Pascual - Sedano , 2003 ; Halbig et al . , 2003 ; Hershey et al . , 2004 ; Hilker et al . , 2003 ; Jahanshahi et al . , 2000 ; Limousin et al . , 1998 ; Lopiano et al . , 2002 ; Moretti et al . , 2003 ; Moro et al . , 1999 ; Morrison et al . , 2004 ; Patel et al . , 2003 ; Perozzo et al . , 2001 ; Pillon et al . , 2000 ; Saint - Cyr , Tre´panier , Rajeev , Lozano , & Lang , 2000 ; Schneider et al . , 2003 , Schroeder et al . , 2003 , 2004 ; Tre´panier et al . , 2000 ; Volkmann et al . , 2001 ; Whelan , Murdoch , Theodoros , Hall , & Silburn , 2003 ; Witt et al . , 2004 ) . The G (cid:1) Power statistical package ( Buchner , Faul , & 30 STEVEN PAUL WOODS ET AL . Erdfelder , 1997 ; Erdfelder , Faul , & Buchner , 1996 ) was then used to calculate the statistical power of each study . Specifically , post hoc power calculations for paired - samples t - tests were generated considering each individual study’s sample size , associated degrees of freedom , and a critical alpha level of 0 . 05 . The effect size index f [ ( r m ) = r ] is recommended for study designs in which k (cid:2) 2 ( Cohen , 1988 ) , as with the STN DBS literature where multiple repeated measures designs are common - place . Accordingly , power estimates were conducted using a priori defined Cohen’s f values for small ( f ¼ 0 . 10 ) , medium ( f ¼ 0 . 25 ) , and large ( f ¼ 0 . 40 ) effect sizes . Cohen’s f values—which are always positive and range from zero to an indefinite upper limit—are interpreted as the standard deviation of the standardized means in a given set of populations ( Cohen , 1988 ) . Following recommendations from Zak - zanis ( 2001 ) and Rossi ( 1990 ) , we also calculated power estimates for very large ( f ¼ 1 . 5 ) Cohen’s f values since traditional effect size conventions may not adequately cover the range of effects that might be of clinical interest . In a second analysis , we derived power values specifically for verbal fluency tasks using the observed rather than a priori defined effect sizes . Verbal fluency tasks were reported in 19 ( 63 % ) of the 30 STN DBS studies , making them the most commonly employed cognitive measures in this literature . Power values were calculated for these studies using the observed effect size ( f ) , sample size , degrees of freedom , and a critical alpha level of 0 . 05 . We were unable to derive power values for 5 of the 19 verbal flu - ency studies because they did not report sufficient data to generate an effect size . RESULTS None of the 30 studies reported statistical power analyses or formal measures of effect size . The median sample size of persons with PD undergoing STN DBS in these studies was 14 ( interquartile range ¼ 8 , 22 ) . Descriptive statistics derived from the post hoc power analyses are presented in Table 1 . Results revealed overall mini - mal power for the detection of conventionally small , medium , or large effect sizes ( range ¼ 0 . 05 , 0 . 91 ) . Only 7 % ( n ¼ 2 ) of the studies reviewed demonstrated adequate power ( (cid:2) 0 . 80 ) to detect a traditionally large effect . Power estimates based on observed effect sizes from the 14 studies that reported sufficient data on verbal fluency are displayed in Table 2 .

STATISTICAL POWER IN STN DBS 31 Cohen’s f effect size of 0 . 23 ( SD ¼ 0 . 15 ) in these studies provided a mean observed power of 0 . 16 ( SD ¼ 0 . 12 ) to detect postsurgical verbal fluency changes . Not surpris - ingly , the five studies that reported significant declines in verbal fluency after STN DBS demonstrated superior power ( M ¼ 0 . 25 , SD ¼ 0 . 09 ) to the nine that observed no such changes ( M ¼ 0 . 11 , SD ¼ 0 . 13 ) , X 2 ( 1 , N ¼ 14 ) ¼ 5 . 6 , p ¼ . 02 , d ¼ 1 . 27 , power ¼ 0 . 55 . DISCUSSION Published studies on the neuropsychological sequelae of STN DBS in PD lar - gely suggest that this procedure is associated with minimal risk of gross cognitive decline for a majority of appropriate surgical candidates . In support of this conten - tion , data from the present review indicate that , on average , studies within the STN DBS literature demonstrate a 94 % chance of detecting such substantial postsurgical cognitive declines ( i . e . , very large effect sizes ) if they were truly present . However , it remains uncertain whether STN DBS leads to milder cognitive decrements in atten - tion , verbal memory , and executive functions ( see Woods et al . , 2002 ) that neverthe - less might be of clinical significance . Our review revealed surprisingly low statistical power to identify conventionally small , medium , and large effect sizes in the STN DBS cognitive outcomes literature ; for example , the studies reviewed averaged only a 34 % probability of accurately detecting the presence of a traditionally large effect . In fact , only two ( 7 % ) of the 30 published studies reviewed afforded sufficient power ( (cid:2) 0 . 80 ) to detect a hypothesized large effect size . Low power was evident even when we examined the observed medium effect sizes associated with postsurgical changes in verbal fluency , which was the most commonly assessed domain . Notably , studies that reported significant postsurgical verbal fluency declines displayed superior power to those that observed no effect of DBS on verbal fluency performance . It is widely held that the substantial gains in motor functioning and health - related quality of life after STN DBS ( e . g . , Pollak et al . , 2002 ) outweigh the risk of cognitive decline for a large proportion of surgical candidates ( Woods et al . , 2002 ) . However , evidence for low statistical power to detect small , medium , and large effect sizes precludes one from drawing conclusions regarding the full impact of STN DBS on cognitive functions . This is of considerable importance because Type II error is especially risky when assessing cognitive morbidity associa - ted with STN DBS ( cf . , an elevated Type I error risk would fall conservatively in the direction of safety ) . While the presence of Type II error in interventional studies designed to detect the benefits of a given procedure may result in the erroneous Table 2 Effect sizes and statistical power of verbal fluency changes after STN DBS in persons with PD Verbal fluency statistic M SD Median IQR Range Effect size ( f ) . 23 . 15 . 18 . 14 , . 30 . 05 , . 61 Power . 16 . 12 . 11 . 06 , . 23 . 06 , . 45 Note .

Indeed , postsurgical cognitive decrements associated with large ( and perhaps even medium ) effect sizes may adversely impact performance of IADLs for persons with PD ( e . g . , Cahn et al . , 1998 ; Chaytor & Schmitter - Edgecombe , 2003 ) , especially for patients with mild presurgical cognitive deficits for whom even a slight decrement in neurop - sychological performance may lead to IADL complications . Accordingly , the possi - bility of significant Type II error in the existing STN DBS cognitive outcomes literature might influence the clinical decision - making process regarding the risk – benefit ratio of cognitive morbidity and considerable motor gains associated with this procedure . Surgical candidates and their caregivers should be informed regard - ing the possible risk of unforeseen cognitive decrements associated with STN DBS . A postsurgical neuropsychological evaluation may be indicated to assess the possible incidence of subtle cognitive , psychiatric , and = or functional impairment , as well as to inform interventions that would maximize adherence to postsurgical medical regi - mens ( Woods et al . , 2002 ) . Inadequate statistical power necessitates cautious interpretation of the concep - tually driven investigations of the STN’s involvement in higher - level cognitive func - tions . Given the relative ease with which stimulation parameters may be manipulated on an outpatient basis , DBS provides the cognitive neuropsychologist a unique opportunity to employ more rigorous , hypothesis - driven experimental methodolo - gies . In response , emerging studies are exploring the nature and extent of the STN’s role in specific aspects of language , executive functions , and social cognition using dissociation methodologies ( e . g . , on - off - on stimulation designs ) that require accept - ance of a true null hypothesis . Nevertheless , absence of evidence cannot be taken as convincing evidence of absence when interpreting the literature regarding the neu - ropsychological sequelae of STN DBS in persons with PD . As eloquently stated by Cohen ( 1988 ) : An analysis which finds that the power was low should lead one to regard the nega - tive results as ambiguous , since failure to reject the null hypothesis cannot have much substantive meaning when , even though the phenomenon exists ( to some given degree ) , the a priori probability of rejecting the null hypothesis was low . ( p . 4 ) The small samples in the STN DBS literature are ostensibly a function of logistical and ethical problems inherent to research evaluating novel neurosurgical procedures ( see Fields & Tro¨ster , 2000 ) . Although the use of repeated - measures methodologies may increase study power by reducing variability parameters ( Vickers , 2003 ) , investigators are nevertheless encouraged to maximize the number of enrolled study participants . Such efforts will likely be facilitated by the increasing availability of STN DBS subsequent to its approval by the Food and Drug Admin - istration . Ideally , sample sizes would be dictated by a priori power analyses . Numerous texts ( e . g . , Cohen , 1988 ) , published articles ( e . g . , Hallahan & Rosenthal , 1996 ) , and computer software packages ( e . g . , G (cid:1) Power : Buchner et al . , 1997 ) are readily accessible in this regard . Sample sizes informed by a priori power analyses will increase statistical rigor , as well as afford investigators the opportunity to utilize more complex statistical procedures to examine possible mediators of postsurgical STATISTICAL POWER IN STN DBS 33 cognitive changes ( e . g . , age , presurgical cognitive deficits , psychiatric illness , stimu - lation parameters ) . A few limitations of the current study should be highlighted . Firstly , not all of the studies included in this review were designed for the primary purpose of evaluat - ing cognitive outcomes . Secondly , the post hoc statistical power analyses reported herein were conducted specifically for paired - samples statistical tests and therefore do not necessarily generalize to other reported statistical analyses ( e . g . , between - group comparisons or regression - based analyses ) ( see Rossi , 1990 ) . Thirdly , the apparent variability in the STN DBS cognitive outcomes literature may be partly attributable to factors other than low statistical power . For instance , heterogeneity in participant demographics and disease characteristics , surgical techniques , stimu - lation parameters , variable test - retest intervals , practice effects , postsurgical medication changes , and = or Type I error due to multiple exploratory statistical com - parisons ( see Maxwell , 2004 ) might also contribute to inconsistent findings ( see Woods et al . , 2002 , for review ) . When appropriate , investigators might therefore consider decreasing sample heterogeneity , using highly reliable and valid dependent measures with continuous outcome variables ( cf . , dichotomous dependent variables ) , limiting critical alpha corrections , and pooling data across multiple research centers in an effort to increase power ( e . g . , Hallahan & Rosenthal , 1996 ; Maddock & Rossi , 2001 ) . Finally , meta - analyses are another means of potentially increasing the statisti - cal power of existing literatures that , like STN DBS , are hampered with small sample sizes ( e . g . , Demakis , 2003 ) . Enhanced statistical power is one of the most commonly cited benefits of meta - analytic studies ( Cohn & Becker , 2003 ) . A fundamental aim of a meta - analysis is to estimate a population effect size ( h ) by examining findings across independent studies ( Demakis , 2006 ) . Meta - analyses can increase statistical power by lowering the standard error associated with the population effect size , which ultimately provides a smaller confidence interval and thereby increases one’s power to detect true nonzero population effects ( Cohn & Becker , 2003 ) . Meta - analy - ses would also allow for a more precise and powerful examination of potential mod - erator variables ( e . g . , stimulation parameters ) that might influence the neuropsychological outcomes of STN DBS . A priori power analyses should also be considered to evaluate the risk of Type II error for meta - analyses , particularly when studies with small sample sizes are involved ( Hedges & Pigott , 2001 ) .
