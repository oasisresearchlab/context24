Using single - molecule mRNA quantiﬁcation in Drosophila embryos , we determine the magnitude of ﬂuctuations in the expression of four critical patterning genes . The accumulation of mRNAs is identical across genes and ﬂuctuates by only (cid:1) 8 % between neighboring nuclei , generating precise protein distributions . In contrast , transcribing loci exhibit an intrinsic noise of (cid:1) 45 % independent of speciﬁc promoter - enhancer architecture or ﬂuctu - ating inputs . Precise transcript distribution in the syncytium is recovered via straightforward spatio - temporal averaging , i . e . , accumulation and diffusion of transcripts during nuclear cycles , without regula - tory feedback . Common expression characteristics shared between genes suggest that ﬂuctuations in mRNA production are context independent and are a fundamental property of transcription . The ﬁndings shed light on how the apparent paradox between stochastic transcription and developmental preci - sion is resolved . INTRODUCTION A fundamental question in biology concerns the degree of preci - sion that cellular systems exhibit in their responses to a given set of environmental conditions , extracellular signals , or other input stimuli ( Lagha et al . , 2012 ; Lander 2013 , Little and Wieschaus , 2011 ) . Production of and interactions between molecules are intrinsically stochastic , limiting the ability of cells to control gene expression and biochemical activities ( Raser and O’Shea , 2005 ) , but the propensity of cellular systems to achieve appro - priate phenotypic behavior constrains the tolerable magnitude of molecular ﬂuctuations ( Rao et al . , 2002 ) . In most contexts , it is unknown how closely cellular activity and phenotypic behavior rely on precise control of gene expression . Many features of Drosophila embryogenesis suggest that strict control of gene expression determines reproducible and precise cell fate establishment . In Drosophila embryos , patterned gene expression in the early syncytium of (cid:1) 6 , 000 nuclei is triggered by asymmetrically distributed , maternally supplied cues ( Sauer et al . , 1996 ) . Among these is the tran - scription factor Bicoid ( Bcd ) , the anterior - posterior ( AP ) con - centration gradient of which shows remarkably reproducible distributions between embryos ( Gregor et al . , 2007 ) . Moreover , within an embryo , the nuclei at similar AP coordinates differ in Bcd concentration by less than 10 % ( SD over mean ) , a degree of precision sufﬁciently high for each row of cells along the AP axis to discern its position from its immediate neighbors ( Gregor et al . , 2007 ) . Bcd precision correlates with highly precise protein distribution of zygotically expressed target genes ( Dubuis et al . , 2013 ; Gregor et al . , 2007 ) that confer cells with distinct gene expression programs within under 3 hr following fertilization ( Gergen et al . , 1986 ; Kornberg and Tabata , 1993 ) . These observations suggest a model in which tightly regulated transcriptional inputs give rise to rapidly established , highly pre - cise outputs . However , the degree of precision in developmental transcription is largely unexplored . In all contexts assayed from prokaryotes to mammalian cells , absolute levels of a given tran - script differ by at least (cid:1) 50 % between genotypically identical cells , and for a majority of genes , this variability is even higher ( Cohen et al . , 2009 ; Gandhi et al . , 2011 ; Golding et al . , 2005 ; Pare´ et al . , 2009 ; Taniguchi et al . , 2010 ; Raj et al . , 2006 , 2010 ; Reiter et al . , 2011 ; Sigal et al . , 2006 ; Zenklusen et al . , 2008 ) . Quantitative observations support the idea that the process of transcription is intrinsically stochastic ( Kaern et al . , 2005 ; Li and Xie , 2011 ) . In developmental contexts , it is unknown whether relatively small input transcription factor ﬂuctuations impact the transcriptional output and whether embryogenesis requires the activity of specialized ﬁltering and / or feedback mechanisms to ensure ﬁdelity in the rapid establishment of gene expression programs . Cell 154 , 789 – 800 , August 15 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . 789 Here , we address these questions with an enhanced method of ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) and accompanying image analysis ( Little et al . , 2011 ) to label and detect individual zygotically expressed mRNA molecules . We measure in abso - lute molecular counts the magnitude and ﬂuctuations in the earliest gene expression events of the Drosophila embryo . To separate input ﬂuctuations from variability intrinsic to transcrip - tion , we focus on those spatial domains in which gene expres - sion is maximally unconstrained . Here , patterning inputs do not determine expression output levels , and thus , input ﬂuctuations cannot impact output variability . These regions thereby reveal the greatest degree of precision achievable by the system . We show that in these regions , the earliest expressed genes share common expression characteristics : despite their expression in spatially distinct territories , their rates of production are identical , and all display intrinsically stochastic transcriptional activity . These similarities suggest that expression rate and variability result from fundamental , global features of transcriptional regu - lation that limit the attainable degree of precision . Nevertheless , the stochastic expression results in precise and nearly uniform transcript accumulation , achieved by straightforward spatiotem - poral averaging . RESULTS Measuring Absolute Numbers of mRNA Transcripts in Early Drosophila Embryos Previous work in Drosophila embryos has documented that nuclei at similar AP coordinates express nearly equivalent pro - tein amounts of the gap gene Hunchback ( Hb ) with ﬂuctuations of < 10 % ( Gregor et al . , 2007 ) . The transcriptional activator of Hb , Bcd , displays variability on the same order as Hb ( Gregor et al . , 2007 ) . A precise transcriptional response of the hb locus presents the most straightforward though as yet untested expla - nation of minimal Hb variation . To quantitatively evaluate tran - scription of hb , we adapted a FISH method developed previously ( Little et al . , 2011 ) to label hb mRNAs using multiple ﬂuorescently labeled antisense DNA oligonucleotides ( Figure 1A ) . By scanning confocal microscopy , we detect two broad classes of objects : sparse , bright spots representing sites of nascent transcription ( e . g . , Wilkie et al . , 1999 ) ; and numerous diffraction limited spots , (cid:1) 90 % of which are located in the internuclear space that we refer to as cytoplasmic particles ( Figures 1A – 1C ) . These particles exhibit sufﬁciently high contrast to be readily distinguished from background imaging noise using automated image processing ( Figure 1D ) . Each particle is found on at least three adjacent 250 nm confocal imaging sections with three - dimensional struc - ture identical to the measured point spread function ( PSF ; Fig - ures S1A – S1D available online ) . To test detection efﬁciency , we applied probes with alternating ﬂuorophore colors . A mini - mum of 85 % of cytoplasmic particles detected in one channel are found in the other , indicating that > 94 % of mRNAs are detected in at least one channel ( Figures S1E – S1G ) . Tight unimodal clustering around mean intensity suggests that the cytoplasmic particles are similar in mRNA content ( Fig - ure 1D ) . Deviation from mean intensity results from at least two phenomena : particles can be bound by different probe numbers , and multiple particles can overlap and be detected as single A B D E C F Figure 1 .

U . ] ) . See also Figures S1 and S2 . 790 Cell 154 , 789 – 800 , August 15 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . spots . To determine the relative contributions of each , we exam - ined correlation of intensities in two - color detection . Correlation is weak ( Figure 1F ) , implying that the fractional SD of mRNA con - tent in detected particles is at most 16 % ( see Experimental Pro - cedures ) . To determine the number of mRNAs per particle , we compared counts of maternally deposited hb mRNA particles in entire imaged embryos to those from quantitative RT - PCR ( Figure S1H ) . We found an average of 1 . 2 ± 0 . 5 mRNAs per imaged particle . The low mean indicates that the probability of detecting more than two mRNAs per particle is essentially zero . This observation , coupled with the SD in mRNA content from imaging , determines a probability of 97 % of ﬁnding one mRNA per particle ( see Experimental Procedures ) . Moreover , comparing counts of wild - type ( WT ) and hb hemizygous embryos yields a 2 - fold concentration difference ( Figure S1I ) , lending further support to the validity of our approach . Because the density of zygotically produced hb mRNA in - creases above about one molecule per m m 3 , PSFs of individual molecules begin to overlap . We extend particle counting to arbi - trarily high density using the naturally large dynamic expression range . We determine counts in dense regions by measuring total ﬂuorescence collected from all mRNAs per volume and calibrat - ing to low - expressing regions where individual mRNAs are counted directly ( Figure S2A ) . We thereby measure absolute concentration and local ﬂuctuation with accuracies of 12 % and 5 % , respectively ( Figures S2B and S2C ) . The two methods have overlapping domains of applicability : direct counts are ac - curate for transcript concentrations % 0 . 5 molecules / m m 3 , and total ﬂuorescence for concentrations R 0 . 35 molecules / m m 3 ( Figure S2C ) . Thus , our FISH method is suitable for high - preci - sion measurements of absolute mRNA counts at any density . Cytoplasmic hb mRNA and Protein Distributions Display Similar Levels of Precision To assess ﬂuctuations in transcript number between nuclei , we measure mRNA concentration in cylinders separated by one internuclear distance to a depth of 12 m m beneath the plasma membrane , encompassing the majority of zygotically expressed transcripts ( Figures 1E and S3A ) . As expected from prior obser - vations ( e . g . , Tautz et al . , 1987 ) , hb transcripts accumulate dramatically in the embryo anterior during early blastoderm ( Fig - ure 2A ) . Transcription is terminated early in the interphase of nuclear cycle 14 ( nc14 ) except near the embryo midpoint , and maternally supplied transcripts are continuously lost from the posterior ( Figures 2A , S3B , and S3C ) . hb mRNA expression pro - ﬁles correlate well with observed protein levels ( Figure S3D ) . As an initial quantiﬁcation of precision , we ascertain the degree of variability independent of putative regulatory inputs by examining the spatial domain of maximal transcript accumu - lation , i . e . , nuclei found in regions of highest - observed gene product levels . Here , expression noise ( the fractional SD of hb concentration ) is 8 % ± 2 % as early as nc12 ; thus , hb mRNA levels exhibit equal or better precision than Hb protein ( Gregor et al . , 2007 ) . Age - ordered embryos show a monotonically increasing count through mid - nc14 ( Figure 2B ) , with an approx - imately constant fractional SD across embryos ( 17 % ± 3 % , Fig - ure 2B inset ) . Ambiguous age determination in ﬁxed samples results in large ﬂuctuations across embryos of approximately the same age . This effect is minimized in embryos undergoing mitosis , during which transcription ceases ( Shermoen and O’Farrell , 1991 ) , allowing unambiguously temporal ordering . Counts differed by less than 11 % in mitotic embryos , similar to the degree of reproducibility in Hb protein proﬁles ( Gregor et al . , 2007 ) . The actual precision and reproducibility are likely to be higher because our measurements contain systematic errors arising from the FISH procedure such as physical distor - tion ( 5 % measurement error ) and error in counts ( 2 % – 3 % mea - surement error ; see Experimental Procedures and Figure S2C ) . A B Figure 2 . Precision and Reproducibility of Cytoplasmic hb Proﬁles ( A ) Absolute cytoplasmic hb mRNA counts per standardized volume as a function of AP position are presented .

See also Figure S3 . Cell 154 , 789 – 800 , August 15 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . 791 Importantly , variation of cytoplasmic proﬁles is nearly at the level of Poisson counting noise , i . e . , at the lowest bound that can be attained by a stochastic process . For 500 molecules per volume , as observed in late nc13 or early nc14 , counting noise amounts to 5 % , matching the lower bound of our measurements ( Fig - ure 2A , inset ) . Large mRNA counts provide a natural buffer against potential ﬂuctuations in translation that have been observed in other systems ( Bar - Even et al . , 2006 ; Newman et al . , 2006 ; Taniguchi et al . , 2010 ) , yielding precise Hb expres - sion . By comparison , in genome - wide studies , the most highly ( and therefore most precisely ) expressed genes in yeast and E . coli exhibit cell - to - cell ﬂuctuations exceeding 50 % in mRNA count ( Gandhi et al . , 2011 ; Taniguchi et al . , 2010 ) . Thus , early embryos exhibit an extraordinary degree of precision , rarely observed in other contexts . Our timeline suggests that hb transcript lifetime is large because we see no decrease in counts during the 12 th and 13 th mitoses ( Figure 2B ) . We veriﬁed this by measuring hb mRNA lifetime directly , disrupting transcription with a - amanitin injection and subsequently monitoring loss of zygotic hb ( Figures S3E and S3F ) . We ﬁnd a lifetime of (cid:1) 60 min , consistent with an estimate from imaging : transcript loss of < 11 % ( Figure 2B ) in 5 min of mitosis ( Foe and Alberts , 1983 ) corresponds to a lifetime of > 45 min . These results show that the accumulation of tran - scripts is only mildly impacted by degradation . Determining Instantaneous Transcriptional Activity by Measuring Total Nuclear Nascent mRNA Content The low noise of hb cytoplasmic mRNA counts suggests that nuclei in the fully active region produce transcripts at nearly equivalent rates . However , all systems studied to date , including E . coli , yeast , cultured cells , and late Drosophila embryos ( Gold - ing et al . , 2005 ; Larson et al . , 2011 ; Pare´ et al . , 2009 ; Raj et al . , 2006 ; Zenklusen et al . , 2008 ) , produce transcripts through brief intervals of dense output interspersed with long quiescent periods of stochastic duration ( Li and Xie , 2011 ) . This seems incompatible with near uniformity of cytoplasmic mRNA content . To determine the extent of variability in transcriptional activity , we developed a measure of transcription using the ﬂuorescence intensities of nascent transcription sites . Consistent with previous results from Wilkie et al . ( 1999 ) , we observe that the maximum number of detectable nascent sites per nucleus increases from DNA replication during interphase from two sites earlyto four at mid - to - late interphase ( Figure S4A ) . Because sister chromatid loci remain in close physical proximity until mitosis , and because transcription sites occasionally occupy overlapping focal volumes , the number of active loci is challenging to discern . Instead , we used the total ﬂuorescence of all transcription sites in a nucleus as a measure of instanta - neous transcriptional activity . Assuming that nascent and mature mRNAs are equally accessible to probes , nascent site intensities can be represented as an equivalent number of mature cyto - plasmic mRNAs by normalizing to the mean or ‘‘unit’’ intensity of completed transcripts , yielding transcriptional activity in absolute units of total mRNA content . To determine the extent of measurement error arising from differences in probe binding afﬁnity and / or the subsequent normalization procedure , we used probes of alternating ﬂuorophore colors . Ideally , for a given nascent site , the number of cytoplasmic units ( C . U . ) will be iden - tical in both colors . Plotting nascent mRNA content of one color as a function of the other yields points on a line with a slope close to unity ( among ﬁve embryos , the mean slope [ ± SD ] is 0 . 90 ± 0 . 09 ) , with a scatter of 5 % ( Figure 3A ) . We thus measure tran - scriptional activity with an error of 5 % and relate it to absolute mRNA content with an uncertainty under 20 % ( the largest devi - ation of 0 . 90 ± 0 . 09 from 1 ) . Three lines of evidence support the idea that nascent mRNA content reﬂects instantaneous transcriptional activity . First , the appearance of loci is coupled to the nuclear mitotic cycle : they are observed during interphase and absent during mitosis . Second , transcription in anterior nuclei initiates slightly earlier than in those closer to the center of the embryo , both because anterior nuclei inhabit a region of higher concentration of Bcd and because of metasynchronous nuclear divisions propagating as a wave toward the embryo center ( Foe and Alberts , 1983 ) . Consistent with expectation , during the ﬁrst minute of the 13 th interphase , we observe a gradient of nascent mRNA content along the AP axis ( Figure S4B ) . Third , we designed probe sets to label the 5 0 and 3 0 portions of the completed transcript with ﬂu - orophores of green and red colors , respectively . If nascent sites are composed of incomplete transcripts , then 5 0 sequences must be more numerous than 3 0 sequences ( Figure S4C ) , result - ing in an increase of green signal at the expense of red . In agree - ment , our measurements reveal the enrichment of green signal after normalization ( Figure 3B ) . Importantly , greater 5 0 enrich - ment is observed as the fraction of transcript labeled with green ﬂuorophore increases ( increasing slopes of ﬁt lines in Figure 3B ) . Thus , nascent hb loci are largely composed of unﬁnished tran - scripts and serve as a measure of transcriptional activity . Variation in Nascent Transcription Site Activity Is 6 - Fold Higher than Variation in Cytoplasmic Output Given the low noise in cytoplasmic counts , we expected that the nascent mRNA content at all genomic loci would rise simulta - neously until saturated with RNA polymerase II ( RNAP ) , in princi - ple reaching and sustaining some maximum nascent mRNA content . However , our measurements of nascent mRNA content show otherwise ( Figures 3C – 3E ) . The nuclear nascent mRNA content varies by 22 % ± 3 % , 3 - fold higher than that observed in cytoplasmic counts . To be certain that this variability does not result from the delay in attaining steady - state maximum activity after mitosis ( Figure S4D ) , we conﬁned our analysis to mid and late interphase 13 embryos . We observe this degree of variation even when loci are allowed the full temporal extent of interphase 13 to reach a putative maximum ( Figure 3E ) . These results indicate that hb loci fail to sustain any amount of uniform maximum content . The 22 % variation we observe reﬂects ﬂuctuations across a maximum of four active genomic loci in each nucleus of WT embryos . If transcription from each locus acts independently , then the variability between nuclei must decrease in proportion to the root of the number of loci ; thus , the expected variability between individual loci is 22 % 3 ﬃﬃﬃ 4 p = 44 % . To test whether loci are in fact independent , we examined embryos heterozygous for a hb deﬁciency in which each nucleus possesses a maximum of only two loci . We observed that total nascent mRNA content 792 Cell 154 , 789 – 800 , August 15 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . per nucleus varies by 33 % ± 6 % , which corresponds to a transcriptional activity of 33 % 3 ﬃﬃﬃ 2 p = 47 % in individual loci . This number is nearly identical to WT and , hence , consistent with independence . The variability between individual loci of (cid:1) 45 % represents a 6 - fold increase over ﬂuctuations in cyto - plasmic counts . Analyzing closely apposed alleles on sister chromatids with sufﬁcient separation to reliably gauge intensities reveals no correlation in their activities ( Figure 4A ) , indicating in - dependent activity even for recently duplicated loci . If the observed ﬂuctuations result from variability in any input factor controlling hb expression ( i . e . , ‘‘extrinsic’’ noise ) , then the varia - tion in total nuclear activity would show no dependence on the number of loci in the nucleus . However , because the noise scales with the number of loci ( Figure 4B ) , the ﬂuctuations we observe in the maximally expressed domain are intrinsic to the process ( es ) of transcription and not determined by variability in the controlling inputs . Transcriptional activity will necessarily exhibit some degree of noise arising from stochastic single - molecule events , but the ﬂuctuations we observe exceed the Poisson expectation consid - erably . From our observations , we can estimate the number of RNAPs engaged in transcription per nucleus and thereby deter - mine the expected degree of ﬂuctuations ; we ﬁnd the predicted noise magnitude of at most 11 % ( see Experimental Procedures ) . Theobserved ﬂuctuationsof22 % ± 3 % areat least2 - fold greater than this prediction , ruling out a model in which transcriptional ﬂuctuations in the region of maximum expression are determined by a single rate - limiting step of RNAP loading ( Figure S4C ) . From these observations , we conclude that ﬁrst , even in the domain of maximal expression , hb is not saturated with the maximum possible density of RNAP , and second , despite the near uniformity of cytoplasmic transcript concentration , instan - taneous activity of individual hb loci is intrinsically stochastic . The estimated variation in transcriptional activity at an individual locus is very similar to the minimum value of (cid:1) 50 % observed for differences in mRNA numbers for the most highly expressed genes in yeast and E . coli ( Gandhi et al . , 2011 ; Taniguchi et al . , 2010 ) . In all contexts , variation between cells is signiﬁcantly higher than that predicted for a process with a single rate - limiting step ( Chubb et al . , 2006 ; Golding et al . , 2005 ; Le et al . , 2005 ; Raj et al . , 2006 ) . These similarities across such diverse contexts sug - gest that the observed ﬂuctuations are globally inherent features of the activity of otherwise ‘‘fully activated’’ genes .

The observed tolerance of ﬂuctuations , linked with the apparent inability to sustain saturating RNAP density , suggests that this degree of imprecision cannot be circumvented even in this highly precise developmental context . The Magnitude of Expression Noise Is Independent of Autoregulation and Transcriptional Modulation Our results suggest that in addition to ﬂuctuations from control - ling inputs , hb activity possesses a large inherently stochastic component . We examined whether the inherent noise could be attributed to features of hb regulation . First , the hb locus con - tains several binding elements for Hb protein itself , and genetic evidence indicates that Hb is required for its own expression ( Holloway et al . , 2011 ; Margolis et al . , 1995 ; Treisman and Desplan , 1989 ) . Positive feedback will amplify ﬂuctuations if locally produced mRNA and protein dominate autoregulation ( i . e . , if diffusion is limited ) . Second , noise necessarily decreases as RNAPs approach their maximum loading density along the gene , but transcriptional repressors might disallow high den - sities , resulting in greater variability . To determine the effect of positive feedback , we examined mRNA production in embryos homozygous for an early hb stop codon . Mutants and WT siblings display similar expression pat - terns until mid - nc14 when WT embryos show reduced anterior expression and the loss of accumulated transcripts ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . In mutants , hb is maintained , resulting in continued high transcript density at late times ( Figure 5A ; Margolis et al . , 1995 ) . However , the absence of autoinhibition did not alter the magnitude of variation in transcriptional activity compared to WT siblings , supporting the idea of intrinsic ﬂuctuations and sug - gesting that zygotic Hb inhibits its own expression ( Li et al . , 2008 ; Perry et al . , 2012 ; Treisman and Desplan , 1989 ) . We also examined whether the removal of transcriptional in - hibitors would allow the accumulation of larger numbers of RNAP . First , we examined hb expression in runt homozygous mutants because Runt is implicated in gap gene regulation ( Chen et al . , 2012 ; Li et al . , 2008 ; Tsai and Gergen , 1994 ) . hb expression differs from WT starting at mid - nc14 when runt embryos maintain high levels of hb transcript in the anterior 20 % – 40 % ( Figure 5C ) . hb proﬁles in runt mutants tend to resemble younger WT siblings , reaching WT levels near the end of nc14 ( Tsai and Gergen , 1994 ) , suggesting a delay in the reduction of anterior expression . In support , we ﬁnd that runt mutants express slightly greater transcriptional activity than WT embryos with similar expression proﬁles ( Figure 5D ) . How - ever , at no time does expression noise differ noticeably from WT . Therefore , runt activity is required for the correct timing of hb downregulation but plays no discernable role in determining ﬂuctuations in transcriptional activity . Finally , we tested the effect of manipulating the activity of maternally provided transcriptional modulators . We impaired the activity of the repressors Capicua and the corepressor Grou - cho by mutation and observed that although hb expression boundaries were altered consistent with previous observations ( e . g . , Margolis et al . , 1995 ) , hb expression noise in the anterior was not affected . We also altered the genetic dosage of bcd to provide between 50 % and 280 % of WT activity , which shifted hb expression along the AP axis as expected ( Liu et al . , 2013 ) but had no effect on expression variability ( Figures S5A and S5B ) . Thus , our data are consistent with the view that the ﬂuctu - ations in hb transcriptional activity arise from intrinsically sto - chastic processes , independent of variability in transcriptional modulators . Gap Genes Share Expression Characteristics and Are Produced at Equal Rates hb transcription ﬂuctuates around a mean polymerase density that is about half the level that is physically obtainable . What sets the magnitude of the mean activity ? Speciﬁc features of the hb promoter may limit activity . Alternatively , the maximum rate may not be speciﬁc to hb but shared among early expressed genes . If so , this would suggest that the maximum obtainable output , and its related noise level , is not set by any speciﬁc A B Figure 4 . Fluctuations in hb Transcription Are Dominated by Intrinsic Noise ( A ) Transcriptional activity of loci on optically resolved sister chromatids is uncorrelated ( Pearson correlation coefﬁcient R = 0 . 02 ) , compared to the tight correlation ( R = 0 . 97 ) inacontrol experimentusingprobes ofalternating colors ( with 4 % imaging noise ) . ( B ) Transcriptional variability arises from ﬂuctuations in inputs ( extrinsic noise ) and from the process of transcription itself ( intrinsic noise ) . Two extreme scenarios are presented in cartoon form .

To discern between these possibilities , we measured the accumulation of transcripts of four gap genes primarily responsible for trunk patterning : hb , Kru¨ppel ( Kr ) , knirps ( kni ) , and giant ( gt ) ( Figure 6A ) . We found that all four genes display nearly uniform accumulation of cytoplasmic mRNAs accompa - nied by over 3 - fold higher ﬂuctuations in instantaneous transcriptional activity , essentially identical to the characteristics of hb ( Figures 6B and 6C ) . These results strongly suggest that all early transcriptional events are subject to common constraints . To closely compare transcript accumulation between genes , we took advantage of the observation that for Kr and kni , cyto - plasmic mRNA density increases monotonically between early nc12 and well into interphase 14 ( Figures S5C and S5D ) , in contrast to hb , which ceases accumulating broadly in early nc14 ( Figure 2A ) . We used counts of Kr or kni as a proxy for time , reducing staging uncertainty when comparing different genes . We performed dual - color labeling with probes against pairs of gap genes and report cytoplasmic counts of hb , gt , and kni mRNA as a function of Kr ( Figure 6 ) . Figure 6C displays the expression of hb and Kr in WT ( blue ) , hb hemizygous ( green ) , and Kr 1 heterozygous ( red ) embryos during nc12 and nc13 .

See also Figure S5 . after multiplying the counts of the deﬁ - cient gene by 2 , all points collapse onto the same line ( Figure 6C ) , showing the absence of compensatory mechanisms . We observed the same behavior for gt - Kr and kni - Kr expression pairs . Unexpectedly , for the three sets of gene pairs , linear ﬁtting yields lines with slopes between 0 . 9 and 1 . 15 ( Figure 6E ) ; that is , in their regions of maximal expression , the four genes are produced at nearly identical rates . The differences between absolute levels within these regions ( Figure 6E ) reﬂect differences in the timing of when kni , Kr , and gt transcripts begin to accumulate , and for hb the perdurance of maternal mRNA . These maximal production rates are inde - pendent of Bcd activator concentration : although genetically altering the dosage of bcd between 50 % and 280 % of WT shifts the expression domains along the AP axis ( Liu et al . , 2013 ) , this manipulation does not alter either accumulation rate or precision ( Figures S5A and S5B ) . These results are consistent with the idea that these tran - scripts are produced at the same rate . This strong similarity occurs despite the fact that these genes are expressed maximally in nonoverlapping spatial domains . The transcrip - tional activity in the maximally expressed domain and the magnitude of transcriptional noise are therefore set indepen - dently of the inputs that determine spatially patterned ex - pression , which are speciﬁc to each gene . By focusing on the regions of maximal expression , we could isolate the features of transcription that appear to be universal across gap genes and , furthermore , match the noise characteristics previously observed in bacteria and cell cultures . This suggests that the failure to sustain a maximal loading of RNAPs on Cell 154 , 789 – 800 , August 15 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . 795 the gene and the intrinsic noise of 45 % are a common feature of transcriptional activation across diverse biological contexts . DISCUSSION The fundamental question of how embryos achieve precise control over the earliest transcriptional events is largely unan - swered . General models of embryogenesis posit that early developmental events are dominated by molecular noise and imprecision in the control of gene expression ( Arias and Hay - ward , 2006 ; Manu et al . , 2009 ; Rao et al . , 2002 ) , a view consis - tent with observations of wide ﬂuctuations in transcriptional activity in the majority of systems assayed quantitatively ( Li and Xie , 2011 ) . Indeed , the ﬁnding in ﬂy embryos that instanta - neous transcriptional activity varies between loci by nearly 50 % suggests that early transcription in ﬂy embryos obeys rules of stochastic activity observed in other systems where output can vary by a similar degree and is often much higher ( Munsky et al . , 2012 ) . Stochastic variation appears to be a universal feature of transcription from single - cell organisms grown in cul - ture ( Raj et al . , 2006 ; So et al . , 2011 ; Stewart - Ornstein et al . , 2012 ) and for cells in certain developmental settings ( Pare´ et al . , 2009 ; Raj et al . , 2010 ; Saffer et al . , 2011 ) . Drosophila embryos display an extraordinary degree of precision in the rapid establishment of distinct gene expression programs ; neverthe - less , even this system cannot circumvent stochastic transcrip - tional activity . This ﬁnding supports the idea that control systems that might overcome stochastic molecular activity are difﬁcult to design , costly to implement , and rarely if ever found ( Lestas et al . , 2010 ) . It is possible that cultured yeast and bacteria exist at sufﬁ - ciently high densities such that precision is not required to ensure survival of a large fraction of the population ; indeed , in several cases , stochastic expression serves to maximize survival options ( Balaban et al . , 2004 ; Maamar et al . , 2007 ; Mirouze et al . , 2011 ; Nachman et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , for prokaryotes and haploid yeast and unlike early embryos , the presence of a single genomic locus precludes the possibility of noise ﬁltering by aver - aging over independent loci . Alternatively , precision might be required to ensure the survival of single - cell organisms when grown in their endogenous conditions , which may be difﬁcult to study in a laboratory setting . However , in stark contrast to single - cell organisms , many developing embryos possess large ﬁelds of cells that must coordinately undertake rapidly deter - mined fate decisions , thus mandating high precision and low expression noise such that the appropriate gene expression pro - grams are induced at the correct time and place . If in Drosophila patterning mRNAs accumulate in a precise manner minimizing expression noise , as we have shown here , how then can the embryo achieve this near uniformity ? Spatiotemporal Averaging Reconciles Highly Variant Transcription with Precise Accumulation and Recovers the Input - Output Relationship Large differences in nascent transcript content sustained over sufﬁciently long periods would inevitably result in unequal transcript production , inconsistent with nearly homogeneous cytoplasmic transcript concentration . As noted above , the long lifetime of hb transcripts allows substantial accumulation during the course of the syncytial blastoderm stage .

The impact of time averaging can be estimated in two independent ways . First , transcript accumulation reﬂects temporal integration of a signal ﬂuctuating with a characteristic time t 0 , the time it takes a polymerase to traverse the 3 . 2 kbp of the hb gene . RNAP processivity is esti - mated at 1 . 1 – 1 . 4 kbp / min ( Irvine et al . , 1991 ; O’Brien and Lis , 1993 ; Shermoen and O’Farrell , 1991 ; Thummel et al . , 1990 ) , providing a rough estimate consistent with the observed noise ﬁltering ( see Extended Experimental Procedures ) . Alternatively , a more careful estimate ( Figure S6B ) yields a theoretical bound on the maximum efﬁciency of temporal averaging based on directlymeasuredquantities , mostcrucially , theabsolutenumber of engaged polymerases per nucleus . In the case of Kr mRNA proﬁle , by the time the mean expression level reaches 800 molecules per nucleus , pure temporal averaging can at most reducethe expression noise to 8 % . For these late embryos , how - ever , our measurements show a consistently lower noise level of 6 % ± 2 % , suggesting an additional noise - ﬁltering mechanism . Additional ﬁltering can be readily provided by a small degree of spatial averaging by the exchange of mRNA between neigh - boring cytoplasmic volumes before the partitioning of the syncy - tial blastoderm . mRNA possesses some mobility : both hb and Kr transcript numbers increase at > 10 m m from their sites of pro - duction in nuclei ( Figures S3A and S6A ) . We note that cylindrical summation volumes with a diameter of one internuclear distance contact each other , so that the mRNA traveling distance required to observe spatial averaging is very small . A straightforward estimate ( see Extended Experimental Procedures ) shows that attributing the excess noise ﬁltering to spatial averaging requires only 4 % of produced transcripts to be exchanged between neighboring volumes . Thus , even a limited degree of spatial averaging is completely sufﬁcient to account for the appearance of low variation in cytoplasmic accumulation from stochastic transcription . These results have several implications . First , we note that the observed variation in cytoplasmic concentration is likely to contain error introduced by our measurement , and the variation we observe is nearly at the level of counting noise . This might indicate that spatial averaging predominates the ﬁltering of tran - scription noise ; however , the degree to which RNAP numbers ﬂuctuate and , therefore , the extent of purely temporal averaging can only be determined with measurements in living embryos . Second , both spatial and temporal averaging mechanisms effec - tively relax a requirement for rapid , tightly controlled transcrip - tional responses to modulating inputs , thereby minimizing the need for additional layers of feedback or other control systems . In turn , the ﬂuctuations of putative inputs must approach the same degree of noise as the intrinsic variability of the transcrip - tional process itself before any effect on gene expression is realized . It is well established that the position of the Hb expression boundary depends on Bcd genetic dosage ( Driever and Nu ¨ sslein - Volhard , 1988 ) and that the concentration of Hb protein along the AP axis depends upon and is at least as precise as Bcd concentration ( Gregor et al . , 2007 ) . Superﬁcially , a highly sto - chastic transcriptional response would appear to render irrele - vant any link between Bcd precision and Hb output : the 10 % ﬂuctuations observed for Bcd ( Gregor et al . , 2007 ) cannot directly impact a transcriptional process whose noise is > 40 % . However , each nucleus employs averaging mechanisms re - ducing the effect of intrinsic noise . Because of the central role played by time averaging , the relative importance of various noise sources depends on the timescale of observation . The immediate readout ( on a scale of minutes ) is dominated by intrinsic transcriptional noise that renders the precision of the input irrelevant . Averaging over active loci , over time , and between neighboring nuclei , the contribution of intrinsic noise becomes comparable with the input ( or extrinsic ) ﬂuctuations . Thus , on a long timescale , such as 3 hr of development , the pre - cision of patterning decisions becomes limited by the extrinsic variability . A precise response to Bcd will be recovered as long as the mean activity of hb transcription is correlated with Bcd concentration , as proposed previously by Erdmann et al . ( 2009 ) . This reconciles the apparently stochastic behavior of hb transcriptional activity with the precisely positioned boundary of expression ( Porcher et al . , 2010 ) . In this manner , Hb activity and ﬂuctuations in the boundary domain retain the previously observed dependence upon levels of and ﬂuctuations in Bcd concentration . Limitations to Precise Control of Gene Expression We have shown that in the context of the gap genes , transcript output in the maximally expressing region does not equate with the actual maximum attainable density of RNAP loading . This maximum is attained by only a small fraction of nuclei at any given moment . Thus , it is currently unclear what determines the mean density of RNAP loading common to these four genes and what prohibits all nuclei from continuously activating the achievable maximum density . It is possible that the output rate is determined by a common , maternally supplied and spatially ubiquitous factor , for example Zelda or BSF ( De Renzis et al . , 2007 ; Liang et al . , 2008 ) , which calibrates the RNAP density of these four genes to give rise to the observed transcript output rate . Conversely , from the perspective of noise minimization , it would seem advantageous to design these genes’ promoter - enhancer architecture such as to obtain the actual maximum possible density because higher output achieves greater noise reduction . However , a biological system likely cannot be readily engineered to produce transcripts at an arbitrarily rapid rate . Hence , it seems likely that mean RNAP loading , and hence tran - script output , is strongly inﬂuenced by physical considerations , such as transcription factor binding , promoter melting , enhancer looping , and / or chromatin accessibility , that might be difﬁcult to overcome by any simple means . Future work will determine the extent to which the mean polymerase density we observe for these four genes is a shared feature of early expression and the extent to which this rate can be manipulated according to cellular context . Moreover , further studies will be required to determine the timescale of ﬂuctuations of an active locus during interphase , i . e . , whether variations arise largely from ‘‘bursts’’ of dense RNAP loading followed by quiescent periods , or con - versely , if the variations result from RNAP - loading rates that are maintained continuously during interphase but differ dramat - ically between loci . Cell 154 , 789 – 800 , August 15 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . 797 The formation of cellular membranes during the 14 th inter - phase prohibits spatial exchange . It is thus improbable that spatial averaging mechanisms can play a role in ensuring precise responses at this time . Moreover , the transcripts of the pair - rule genes are directed to the apical surface where they accumulate ( Davis and Ish - Horowicz , 1991 ) . Differential cellular behavior , presaging the formation of morphological structures , emerges in the latter part of the 14 th interphase . Thus , it is likely that shortly after the onset of the 14 th interphase , individual cells begin accu - mulating gene products required for their speciﬁc behaviors , thus rendering spatial averaging a hindrance to differentiation . It is therefore likely that temporal averaging and / or other mech - anisms such as regulatory feedback ensure the precise distribu - tion of patterning factors at this time . The degree of precision of transcriptional events over the course of the 14 th interphase will be the subject of future investigations .
