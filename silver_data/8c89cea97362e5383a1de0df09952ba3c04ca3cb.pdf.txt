De novo conformational coupling between elements in the plasma membrane and Ca 2 + stores , where the actin cytoskeleton plays an important regulatory role , has been proposed as the most likely mechanism to activate SOCE in platelets . Here we have examined for the first time changes in platelet F - actin levels on a sub - second timescale . Using stopped - flow fluorimetry and a quenched - flow approach we provide evidence for the involvement of cofilin in actin filament reorganization and SOCE in platelets . Thrombin ( 0 . 1 unit / ml ) evoked an initial decrease in F - actin that commenced within 0 . 1 s and reached a minimum 0 . 9 s after stimulation , prior the activation of SOCE . F - actin then increased , exceeding basal levels again approximately 2 . 5 s after stimulation . Thrombin also induced cofilin dephosphorylation and activation , which paralleled the changes observed in F - actin , and rapid Btk activation . Inhibition of cofilin dephosphorylation by LFM - A13 resulted in the loss of net actin depolymerization and an increased delay in SOCE initiation . These results suggest that cofilin is important for the rapid actin remodeling necessary for the activation of SOCE in platelets through de novo conformational coupling .

Indirect coupling models assume the generation of a small diffusible molecule that operates as a Ca 2 + influx factor ( CIF ) so gating Ca 2 + channels in the PM . 6 - 8 On the other hand , direct or constitutive conformational coupling models propose a physical interaction between Ca 2 + channels in the PM and IP 3 receptors in the membrane of the intracellular Ca 2 + stores . 5 , 9 It has also been suggested that SOCE might be activated by the insertion of preformed channels into the PM by vesicle fusion in a “secretion - like” coupling model . 10 , 11 A modification of the constitutive conformational coupling model proposes a dynamic and reversible conformational coupling based on the transport of portions of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) containing IP 3 receptors to the PM to facilitate de novo protein coupling . 9 , 12 - 14 De novo conformational coupling requires a mechanical support provided by the actin cytoskeleton . 14 In addition , the cortical actin cytoskeleton plays a regulatory role by acting as a negative clamp that prevents constitutive coupling and activation of SOCE . 4 , 5 , 14 , 15 The de novo conformational coupling model requires that the cortical actin barrier be rapidly disrupted following cell stimulation to allow the coupling to occur . 9 , 12 , 16 Earlier determinations of agonist - evoked changes in platelet F - actin have been made on a timescale of seconds or minutes ; 17 - 19 however , we are not aware of determinations of F - actin content on the same timescale as agonist - evoked Ca 2 + entry , which can commence within a second of stimulation . 16 , 20 For personal use only . on October 22 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 4 Proteins involved in actin filament remodeling include a large number of actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) , which control actin reorganization by direct contact with F - actin or with G - actin monomers . Some ABPs , like tropomodulin or Cap Z , bind to the barbed ends of F - actin , preventing the addition of more G - actin subunit . 21 - 23 , 24 Twinfilin , verprolin / WIP , DNase I and thymosin (cid:1) 4 , inhibit actin polymerization by sequestering G - actin units . 21 , 24 - 27 The role of other ABPs on actin remodeling , such as profilin and Srv2 , is more subtle . Profilin - bound actin monomers cannot add to the pointed end but add to the barbed end , and Srv2 appears to be a shuttle transferring actin monomers from cofilin to profilin , and allowing nucleotide exchange on the monomers . 28 , 29 Other ABPs , such as gelsolin , actively reduce the length of actin filaments by promoting the cleavage of the filaments . 21 , 30 , 31 Cofilin accelerates depolymerization , though the mechanism of this effect is not completely understood . 21 ABPs can be regulated by several intracellular mechanisms . A major pathway involves the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) by a LIM kinase - Rho - protein kinase C ( PKC ) - Ca 2 + \ calmodulin dependent pathway . 32 - 35 Recent studies have presented an alternative pathway for actin reorganization based on the equilibrium between Ser \ thr kinases and phosphatases . 33 - 37 Especially relevant is the regulation of cofilin by the Ser \ thr phosphatase , slingshot , which dephosphorylates the residue Ser 3 allowing cofilin to bind to the actin cytoskeleton and reduce the length of the actin filament by removing G - actin monomers from the barbed end . 32 - 39 Here we have investigated the temporal relationship between Ca 2 + entry and actin filament reorganization on a sub - second time scale . The results suggest that actin depolymerization precedes release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores and the activation of Ca 2 + entry , the former indicating that it is independent of rises in cytosolic free Ca 2 + concentration ( [ Ca 2 + ] c ) .

K . ) with an excitation wavelength of 340 or 360 nm and emission at 500 nm . Dye - loaded cells ( 100 µl ; 4 x 10 8 cells / mL ) and an agonist solution ( 100 µl ) were introduced into the sample flow circuit via separate reservoirs at the top of the sample - handling unit 16 . Mn 2 + influx was monitored as a quenching of fura - 2 fluorescence at the isoemissive wavelength of 360 nm , presented on an arbitrary linear scale . 40 Results were corrected for the effects of quenching extracellular fura - 2 and basal leak of Mn 2 + into the cells by subtraction of agonist - free control runs . 40 To reduce leakage of Mn 2 + into the cells before the experiment , 50 M M MnCl 2 was added to the cell suspension and 350 M M MnCl 2 was added to the agonist solution , giving a final concentration of 200 M M extracellular Mn 2 + after mixing . F - actin kinetic measurements The kinetics of F - actin reorganization were determined in samples stimulated for various times before fixing using a rapid quench flow system 16 ( Hi - Tech Ltd . , Salisbury , Wilts . , U . K . ) . Briefly , the cell suspension ( 75 µl ) and an agonist solution ( 75 µl ) were introduced into the sample flow circuit via separate reservoirs at the top of the sample - handling unit and then mixed after the times indicated with 75 µl 3 % ( w / v ) formaldehyde in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) before storing on ice for 10 min . Fixed platelets were permeabilized by incubation for 10 min with 0 . 025 % ( v / v ) Nonidet P - 40 detergent dissolved in PBS .

One - dimensional SDS - electrophoresis was performed on 12 . 5 % sodium dodecyl sulphate - polyacrylamide gels and separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred , for 2 h at 0 . 8 mA / cm 2 , in a semi - dry blotter ( Hoefer Scientific , Newcastle , Staffs . , United Kingdom ) onto nitrocellulose for subsequent probing . Blots were incubated overnight with 10 % ( w / v ) BSA in tris - buffered saline with 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ( TBST ) to block residual protein binding sites . Blocked membranes were then incubated with the anti phospho - Btk ( Y - 223 ) antibody or the anti - Btk antibody diluted 1 : 1000 in TBST or with the anti - phosphoSer 3 - cofilin antibody diluted 1 : 250 in TBST or with anti - cofilin antibody diluted 1 : 100 in TBST for 1 h . The primary antibody was removed and blots washed six times for 5 min each with TBST . To detect the primary antibody , blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG antibody or horseradish peroxidase - conjugated donkey anti - goat IgG antibody , diluted 1 : 2000 and 1 : 2500 in TBST , respectively ; washed six times in TBST , and exposed to enhanced chemiluminescence reagents for 1 min . Blots were then exposed to photographic films and the optical density was estimated using scanning densitometry . Statistical Analysis Analysis of statistical significance was performed using Student’s unpaired t - test .

Fura 2 - loaded platelets were rapidly mixed with thrombin at a final concentration of 0 . 1 U / mL in the presence of 100 µ M EGTA and 200 M M MnCl 2 . Recording fura 2 fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm indicated that the delay in onset of thrombin - induced Ca 2 + release from the intracellular stores was 1 . 64 ± 0 . 09 s ( mean ± SE ; Figure 1 ; n = 20 ) . At the isoemissive wavelength of 360 nm , Mn 2 + quench of fura 2 fluorescence was first detected with latencies of 2 . 14 ± 0 . 09 s ( Figure 1 ; n = 20 ) . As shown previously , 16 mixing cells with agonist - free HBS containing 100 µ M EGTA and 200 M M MnCl 2 did not modify fura 2 fluorescence at either excitation wavelength ( not shown ) , confirming that the mixing procedure per se did not activate the cells . Time course of thrombin - evoked actin filament reorganization It has been reported that actin filament reorganization is necessary for the activation of SOCE in a number of cells , including smooth muscle cells , 43 corneal endothelial cells , 7 pancreatic acinar cells 5 , glioma C6 cells 44 and platelets . 14 To investigate the time course of actin filament remodelling , platelet samples were prepared by quenched flow for subsequent staining with FITC - phalloidin . The delay times between the rapid mixing of cells with 0 . 1 U / mL thrombin and the subsequent fixation with 3 % formaldehyde in PBS ( see the Materials and methods section ) were set at 100 - 200 ms intervals for the first 2 s and at 500 ms for subsequent timepoints , commencing 100 ms after the mixing of cells with thrombin . Thrombin ( 0 . 1 U / mL ) For personal use only . on October 22 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 10 evoked an initial decrease in platelet F - actin that commenced within 100 ms and reached a minimum 0 . 9 s after stimulation at 70 . 7 ± 4 . 4 % of the resting level ( Figure 1 ; P < 0 . 05 ; n = 21 ) . The F - actin content then increased , exceeding basal levels again approximately 2 . 5 s after stimulation . As reported above for Ca 2 + mobilization , mixing cells with agonist free HBS did not evoke significant changes in F - actin content ( Figure 1 ; dashed line ) . Time course of cofilin phosphorylation evoked by thrombin The actin depolymerizing factor cofilin is an ABP involved in actin reorganization that is negatively regulated by phosphorylation at Ser 3 and reactivated by dephosphorylation . 34 , 36 In view of the initial net actin depolymerization induced by thrombin we have investigated the time course of changes in cofilin phosphorylation after treatment with 0 . 1 U / mL thrombin . To do this , platelet samples were prepared by quenched flow for subsequent SDS / PAGE and Western - blot analysis . The delay times between the rapid mixing of cells with thrombin and the subsequent mixing with Laemmli´s buffer ( see the Materials and methods section ) were set as described above for determination of F - actin content . Thrombin ( 0 . 1 U / mL ) evoked an initial dephosphorylation of cofilin that commenced within 100 ms and reached a minimum 0 . 9 s after stimulation at 78 . 1 ± 7 . 7 % of the resting level , as detected by Western blotting with an anti - phosphoSer 3 - cofilin antibody ( Figure 2 , top panel and graph ; P < 0 . 05 ; n = 15 ) . Cofilin phosphorylation at Ser 3 then increased , exceeding resting levels again approximately 1 . 5 s after stimulation . Western blotting with an anti - cofilin antibody revealed that a similar amount of the protein was loaded in all lanes ( Figure 2 , lower panel ) . Time course of actin filament reorganization and cofilin phosphorylation evoked by thrombin in the presence of LFM - A13 We have recently demonstrated the involvement of Bruton´s tyrosine kinase ( Btk ) in actin remodelling and SOCE in thapsigargin - treated human platelets . 45 Hence we have investigated For personal use only . on October 22 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 11 whether the role of Btk in SOCE might be mediated by cofilin and the regulation of actin reorganization . The activation of Btk was analysed by Western blotting using a rabbit monoclonal phosphospecific anti - Btk antibody that only detects Btk autophosphorylated at the tyrosine residue 223 , which has been shown to be the full activated form of Btk . 46 , 47 Treatment of human platelets with thrombin ( 0 . 1 U / mL ) evoked a rapid activation of Btk that was detectable within 100 ms and reached a maximum 2 . 5 s after stimulation at 385 ± 27 % of the resting level ( Figure 3 , top panel ; n = 6 ) . Western blotting with an anti - Btk antibody revealed that a similar amount of protein was loaded in all lanes ( Figure 3 , lower panel ) . Pretreatment of platelets for 10 min with 10 M M LFM - A13 , which abolishes Btk activation , 45 inhibited the thrombin - evoked dephosphorylation of cofilin detected in the first 1 . 5 s after stimulation with the agonist , and enhanced thrombin - evoked cofilin phosphorylation as detected by Western blotting with an anti - phosphoSer 3 - cofilin antibody ( Figure 4 ; n = 6 ) . Consistent with this , treatment of the cells for 10 min with 10 M M LFM - A13 abolished thrombin - evoked net actin depolymerization ( Figure 5 ) . After treatment with LFM - A13 the F - actin content 0 . 9 s after treatment with thrombin ( 0 . 1 U / mL ) was 110 % of basal compared with 70 % of basal in controls ( Table 1 ; P < 0 . 001 ) . Treatment of platelets with LFM - A13 did not significantly increase the latency of thrombin - evoked Ca 2 + release . The thrombin - evoked increase in [ Ca 2 + ] c was first detected after a delay of 1 . 85 ± 0 . 14 s after a 10 min pretreatment with 10 M M LFM - A13 ( n = 6 ) , compared with 1 . 64 ± 0 . 09 s in controls ( Table 1 ; P = 0 . 20 ) . In contrast , the latency of thrombin - evoked Mn 2 + entry was increased by the Btk inhibitor ( Table 1 ) . Mn 2 + entry was first detected 2 . 60 ± 0 . 17 s ( n = 10 ) after agonist addition following a 10 min pretreatment with 10 M M LFM - A13 , compared with 2 . 14 ± 0 . 09 s in controls ( P < 0 . 05 ) . We have previously shown that pretreatment of human platelets for 10 min with 10 M M LFM - A13 decreased thrombin - evoked Ca 2 + entry by about 30 % without having any effect on thrombin - evoked release of Ca 2 + from the intracellular stores . 45 For personal use only . on October 22 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 12 Discussion We have previously proposed that SOCE in human platelets may be activated by a de novo conformational coupling model in which Ca 2 + store depletion leads to trafficking of portions of the ER towards the PM to allow coupling between IP 3 RII in the ER membrane and hTRPC1 in the PM 12 - 16 . In support of this model , we have shown that SOCE is reduced by inhibitors of polymerization such as cytochalasin D or latrunculin A , which impair reorganization of the cytosolic actin network that provides support to the transport of the ER towards the PM or by stabilization of the membrane cytoskeleton using jasplakinolide , which interfere with the depolymerization of the membrane cytoskeleton and which might thus prevent the approach of the ER and PM through the dense cortical F - actin layer present in platelets 14 . We have also shown in co - immunoprecitation experiments that Ca 2 + store depletion following treatment with thapsigargin ( TG ) or the physiological agonist thrombin results in de novo coupling of IP 3 RII and hTRPC1 12 , 15 , 16 . This coupling is inhibited by agents that interfere with remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton 15 and is reversed if the Ca 2 + stores are allowed to refill 48 . The coupling between IP 3 RII and hTRPC1 is closely temporally correlated with the activation of Ca 2 + release from the ER and the activation of Ca 2 + entry in thrombin - stimulated platelets 16 , supporting the hypothesis that this coupling event may underlie the activation of SOCE . Rapid coupling of IP 3 RII in the ER membrane to hTRPC1 in the PM requires an equally rapid reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton to allow the approach of the ER and PM , which are normally separated by a dense cortical layer of F - actin 14 . Here we have monitored for the first time thrombin - stimulated changes in platelet F - actin content on a sub - second timescale . Using a quenched - flow approach to fix platelet samples at varying times after stimulation with 0 . 1 U / mL thrombin , we have shown that there is an initial decrease in F - actin content that commenced within 100 ms of stimulation . The F - actin content of the cells reached For personal use only . on October 22 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 13 a minimum around 70 % of the resting level 0 . 9 s after stimulation and then began to increase again , exceeding the resting level about 2 . 5 s after stimulation . The early decrease in platelet F - actin content preceded the release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores , which was determined by stopped - flow fluorimetry in parallel experiments on the same platelet preparations to occur about 1 . 6 s after stimulation with thrombin . This early decrease and subsequent rise in platelet F - actin content may play an important role in the trafficking of portions of the ER towards the PM . The fact that the actin remodeling preceded Ca 2 + store release might explain the close temporal correlation between Ca 2 + release and the coupling of IP 3 RII to hTRPC1 that we have previously reported 16 . Since remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton occurred prior to the release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores , it cannot be dependent on either Ca 2 + store depletion or a rise in [ Ca 2 + ] c . To investigate the mechanism of early thrombin - evoked changes in platelet F - actin , we focused on the possible role of cofilin , an actin binding protein which promotes actin depolymerization by removing G actin subunits from the barbed ends of the filaments . 21 , 25 - 38 Cofilin has been shown to be activated by the Ser \ Thr phosphatase , slingshot , which dephosphorylates the residue Ser 3 , 33 - 39 . Cofilin dephosphorylation has been shown to be involved in transient association with the actin cytoskeleton 49 , decreasing cofilin affinity for actin after phosphorylation at Ser 3 . 50 Western blotting using platelet samples prepared by quenched flow from the same cell preparations used for F - actin measurements revealed that the platelet content of cofilin phosphorylated on Ser 3 changed with a similar timecourse to the content of F - actin . Thrombin ( 0 . 1 U / mL ) evoked an initial dephosphorylation of cofilin that commenced within 100 ms , reached a minimum 0 . 9 s after stimulation at around 78 % of the resting level and then cofilin phosphorylation at Ser 3 increased again , exceeding resting levels about 1 . 5 s after stimulation . The close temporal correlation between the changes in platelet phosphocofilin and F - actin contents are compatible with cofilin playing a role in the observed early actin depolymerisation . For personal use only . on October 22 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 14 A role for cofilin in the early thrombin - evoked actin depolymerisation is supported by our observations with the Btk inhibitor , LFM - A13 . Pretreatment of platelets for 10 min with 10 M M LFM - A13 , which we have previously shown abolishes Btk activation , 45 inhibited the early cofilin dephosphorylation and the actin depolymerisation evoked by thrombin . Our results demonstrate that thrombin induced rapid Btk phosphorylation and activation , which is consistent with a role for Btk in the activation of cofilin and actin filament reorganization stimulated by thrombin . We have previously shown that Btk inhibition reduced Ca 2 + entry evoked following thrombin - evoked Ca 2 + store depletion . 45 Here we found that Btk inhibition increased the latency of thrombin - evoked Ca 2 + entry as assessed by Mn 2 + quench of fura - 2 fluorescence . These alterations in the activation of Ca 2 + entry following Btk inhibition might be explained by a failure of SOCE activation by de novo conformational coupling when actin depolymerization is inhibited . The residual Ca 2 + entry observed following inhibition of actin depolymerization may be accounted for by the cytoskeleton - independent SOCE pathway activated via extracellular signal - related kinase 1 / 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) that we have previously described 51 . Another mechanism of regulating cofilin activity is through its binding to phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) , which inhibits the actin - binding ability of cofilin 52 - 54 . This mechanism has been shown to be important for the spatial regulation of cofilin activity . The PIP 2 - and actin - binding sites have been localized in residues W104 - M115 of the cofilin primary sequence 55 . In addition to the described mechanism of cofilin activation through the activation of Btk , thrombin might also regulate cofilin activity by the activation of phospholipase C , which might cooperate to remodel the actin cytoskeleton through PIP 2 hydrolysis , leading to activation of cofilin 53 . In summary , we have shown that platelet activation by thrombin is associated with rapid depolymerization of F - actin prior to the release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores and the For personal use only . on October 22 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 15 activation of Ca 2 + entry . This early actin depolymerization and later polymerization may be important in allowing trafficking of portions of the ER towards the PM to allowing the de novo coupling of IP 3 RII to hTRPC1 , which we have suggested may underlie the activation of SOCE in human platelets 12 - 16 , 48 . The activation of cofilin by its dephosphorylation at Ser 3 parallels the early thrombin - evoked actin depolymerization and appears to be essential for this to occur . In NIH3T3 cells , cofilin dephosphorylation has been shown to lie downstream of Ras activation and to involve two Ras effector pathways : Raf - MEK and PI3K 56 . We have previously demonstrated that inhibition of Ras 57 , MEK 51 or PI3K 58 results in inhibition of SOCE in human platelets . These earlier data are compatible with an important role for cofilin activity in the activation of SOCE by a reversible de novo coupling model in human platelets .
