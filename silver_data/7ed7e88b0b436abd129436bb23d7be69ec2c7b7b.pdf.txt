The FASEB Journal (cid:127) Research Communication Pivotal role of integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 in hypotonic stress - induced responses of human endothelium Masakazu Hirakawa , Masahiro Oike , 1 Michi Watanabe , Yuji Karashima , and Yushi Ito Department of Pharmacology , Graduate School of Medical Sciences , Kyushu University , Fukuoka , Japan ABSTRACT We have previously reported that both hypotonic stress ( HTS ) and lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) induce ATP release and a transient reorganiza - tion of actin through sequential activation of RhoA / Rho - kinase and focal adhesion kinase F - actin ( FAK ) / paxillin in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . LPA is known to induce the activation of RhoA via its speciﬁc receptors , but the mechanisms by which HTS initiates these intracellular signals are not known . The present study aimed to identify the mole - cule ( s ) that are unique to the sensing and / or transduc - ing the mechanical stress . Reverse transcriptase - poly - merase chain reaction revealed the expression of several integrin subunits in HUVECs . Anti - integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 antibody ( Ab ) , but not anti - integrin (cid:1) 2 , (cid:1) 6 , (cid:1) v , or (cid:2) 4 antibodies , inhibited HTS - induced RhoA transloca - tion , tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin , ATP release , and actin reorganization . However , the LPA - induced ATP release and actin reorganization were not inhibited by any of these anti - integrin antibod - ies , indicating that integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 plays a pivotal role in the HTS - induced but not in the LPA - induced re - sponses . It is therefore reasonable to assume that this particular subtype of integrin is involved in the initia - tion of the responses induced by mechanical stimuli in HUVECs . —Hirakawa , M . , Oike , M . , Watanabe , M . , Karashima , Y . , Ito , Y . Pivotal role of integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 in hypotonic stress - induced responses of human endothe - lium . FASEB J . 20 , 1992 – 1999 ( 2006 ) Key Words : ATP release (cid:1) tyrosine kinase (cid:1) RhoA (cid:1) actin cy - toskeleton It is well established that vascular endothelial func - tions are controlled by mechanical stresses . We have previously demonstrated that application of hypotonic stress ( HTS ) to human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) sequentially activates within a few minutes small GTPase family protein RhoA and ty - rosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) and paxillin , thereby leading to ATP release and actin reorganization ( 1 ) . Previous reports showed that ty - rosine phosphorylation of FAK and RhoA / Rho kinase activation was also induced by other mechanical stresses , such as shear stress and mechanical strain ( 2 – 5 ) . Furthermore , ATP release and actin reorganiza - tion are well - known mechanosensitive responses in vascular endothelium ( 6 , 7 ) . However , we have shown that lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) also induces the same intracellular signals and responses in HUVECs ( 1 ) , suggesting that the responses evoked by HTS are not speciﬁc for mechanical stress . DNA microarray assay has also shown that the gene expression proﬁle in HUVECs after exposure to shear stress for 24 h was similar to that after stimulation with cytokines , suggest - ing that most of the shear - induced changes were not speciﬁc to shear stress ( 8 ) . We have shown that RhoA activation is the most upstream event in the cascade initiated by HTS ( 1 ) . Although binding of LPA to its speciﬁc receptors activates RhoA and subsequently Rho - kinase ( 9 ) , it seems unlikely that HTS or other mechanical stresses activate LPA receptors but rather that they activate RhoA via an LPA - insensitive pathway . The family of transmembrane integrin molecules has been reported to play a role in mechanical stress - induced endothelial responses , such as cytoskeletal modulation ( 10 ) , cell migration ( 11 ) , endothelium - dependent vasodilatation ( 12 ) , and activation of mitogen - activated protein kinase and FAK ( 13 ) . Therefore , in the present study we investigated the possible involvement of integrins in the HTS - induced responses in HUVECs . For this purpose , we examined the effects of anti - integrin blocking anti - bodies on HTS - and LPA - induced signals and responses in HUVECs . Our results demonstrate that integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 is a key molecule that discriminates between HTS - and LPA - induced responses in HUVECs . MATERIALS AND METHODS Culture of HUVECs HUVECs were purchased from Cambrex ( East Rutherford , NJ ) . Cells were cultured in M199 medium supplemented with 15 (cid:3) g / ml endothelial cell growth supplement ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) , 5 U / ml heparin , and 15 % FBS . 1 Correspondence : Department of Pharmacology , Gradu - ate School of Medical Sciences , Kyushu University , Fukuoka 812 - 8582 , Japan .

Expression of GAPDH mRNA was examined as an internal control with the primers 5 (cid:4) - GGGTCATCATCTCTGCACCT - 3 (cid:4) ( forward ) and 5 (cid:4) - ATCCA - CAGTCTTCTGGGTGG - 3 (cid:4) ( reverse ) . Immunoﬂuorescence staining of integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 Cellular localization of integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 was examined by immu - noﬂuorescence staining with a monoclonal anti - human inte - grin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 antibody ( Ab ; clone JBS5 , Chemicon International , Temecula , CA ) . Cells were washed twice with PBS and incu - bated with the anti - integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 Ab ( 10 (cid:3) g / ml ) for 15 min . The Ab bound to the cell surface integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 was then visualized with FITC - conjugated anti - mouse immunoglobulin ( Ig ) Ab ( Sigma ) . Fluorescence images were captured with a digital microscope camera ( VB6000 , Keyence , Osaka , Japan ) connected to a ﬂuorescence microscope ( Eclipse E600 , Ni - kon , Tokyo , Japan ) . Block of integrins with monoclonal anti - integrin antibodies Monoclonal integrin antibodies were used for blocking inte - grins on cell membrane surface . HUVECs were incubated either with monoclonal anti - human integrin (cid:1) 2 ( clone A2 - IIE10 , 10 (cid:3) g / ml , Upstate Biotechnology , Lake Placid , NY ) , (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 ( 5 (cid:3) g / ml ) , (cid:1) 6 ( clone NKI - GoH3 , 10 (cid:3) g / ml , Chemicon International ) , (cid:1) v ( clone AV1 , 10 (cid:3) g / ml , Chemicon Interna - tional ) , or (cid:2) 4 ( clone ASC - 3 , 10 (cid:3) g / ml , Chemicon Interna - tional ) antibodies at 37°C for 30 ( (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 ) or 60 ( (cid:1) 2 , (cid:1) 6 , (cid:1) v , and (cid:2) 4 ) min . HTS or LPA was then applied to the cells , and assays were performed . Luciferin - luciferase bioluminescence assay The extracellular ATP concentration ( [ ATP ] o ) was measured by using luciferin - luciferase bioluminescence . Cells were seeded on 96 - well plates and cultured for 2 days before the assay . Each well contained before the experiment on average 5000 cells . After careful removal of the culture medium , we added 50 (cid:3) l of isotonic or hypotonic Krebs solution or LPA - containing Krebs solution containing 10 mg / ml luciferase - luciferin ( Wako , CO , Osaka , Japan ) to each well and counted the emitted photons during 10 min by a luminescence detection system ( Argus - 50 / 2D luminometer , Hamamatsu Photonics , Hamamatsu , Japan ) . Standard curves for converting photon counts into [ ATP ] o were obtained with the same solutions to avoid possible artifacts of ionic composition and drugs on the luciferin bioluminescence . Western blot analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation and RhoA activation Tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins and RhoA activation were assessed with chemiluminescence Western blotting using an enhanced chemiluminescence system ( Su - perSignal West Dura , Pierce , Rockford , IL ) . Cells were lysed after 1 , 2 , 5 , or 10 min exposure to HTS . Western blot analysis for phosphotyrosine was performed by using monoclonal anti - phosphotyrosine Ab ( clone PY20 , Exalpha Biologicals , Watertown , MA ) . For the assessment of RhoA activation , the cell lysate was centrifuged for 1 h at 100 , 000 g , and the pellet was harvested as a membrane fraction . A constant amount of membrane fraction ( 50 (cid:3) g protein per lane ) was separated with SDS - PAGE , and RhoA was detected with monoclonal anti - RhoA Ab ( Cytoskeleton , Denver , CO ) . The expression of (cid:2) - actin protein was assessed as an internal control , using monoclonal anti - (cid:2) - actin Ab ( Sigma ) . The emitted chemilumi - nescence was detected in each experiment and analyzed with a lumino image analyzer ( FAS - 1000 , Toyobo , Osaka , Japan ) . Immunological staining of endothelial F - actin The rearrangement of F - actin by HTS was examined by a previously reported immunological method ( 14 ) using rho - damine - conjugated phalloidin ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) . Solutions and drugs The standard extracellular solution was a modiﬁed Krebs solution ( 1 . 5 mM Ca 2 (cid:5) solution ) containing ( in mM ) : 132 NaCl , 5 . 9 KCl , 1 . 2 MgCl 2 , 1 . 5 CaCl 2 , 11 . 5 glucose ( Glc ) , and 11 . 5 HEPES ; pH adjusted to 7 . 3 with NaOH . Hypotonic solutions were made by adding appropriate amounts of distilled water to normal Krebs solution . We have previously conﬁrmed that the reduction of the ionic concentrations did not inﬂuence the [ Ca 2 (cid:5) ] i responses ( 15 ) . All other drugs were purchased from Sigma . Data analysis Pooled data are mean (cid:6) se , and statistical signiﬁcance was determined using Student’s unpaired t test . Probabilities (cid:7) 5 % ( P (cid:7) 0 . 05 ) were regarded as signiﬁcant . RESULTS Expression of integrin subunits in HUVECs First , we examined which subunits of integrin (cid:1) and (cid:2) are expressed in the HUVECs used in the present study . RT - PCR revealed that at least mRNAs of (cid:1) 3 , (cid:1) 5 , (cid:1) 6 , (cid:1) v , (cid:2) 1 , (cid:2) 3 , (cid:2) 4 , and (cid:2) 5 subunits are expressed in HUVECs ( Fig . 1 A ) . Integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 is one of the possible combi - nations of these integrin subunits that has been re - ported to be involved in mechanosensing in vascular 1993 ROLES OF INTEGRIN IN HYPOTONIC RESPONSES endothelium ( 16 ) . We therefore used immunoﬂuores - cence staining with an anti - integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 Ab to detect and localize integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 in HUVECs . As shown in Fig . 1 B , integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 did not show an apparent clustering on the cell surface but was scattered over the mem - brane surface . Effects of integrin antibodies on HTS - induced RhoA activation Next , we examined the effects of blocking antibodies against integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 on HTS - induced responses . We also used the blocking antibodies against integrin (cid:1) 6 , (cid:1) v , and (cid:2) 4 subunits , the mRNAs of which were detected in HUVECs with RT - PCR . Furthermore , to exclude possible nonspeciﬁc effects of IgG , we examined the effects of the blocking Ab against the integrin (cid:1) 2 subunit , which was not detected with RT - PCR . The HTS - induced membrane translocation of small G pro - tein RhoA , a hallmark of its activation ( 17 ) , was maxi - mal 2 to 5 min after starting HTS in control HUVECs ( Fig . 2 ) . The anti - integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 Ab inhibited the mem - brane translocation of RhoA induced by (cid:8) 30 % HTS ( Fig . 2 ) , whereas the other anti - integrin antibodies did not affect the maximal level and the time course of the HTS - induced translocation of RhoA ( Fig . 2 ) . Effects of integrin antibodies on HTS - induced tyrosine phosphorylation In control HUVECs , HTS ( (cid:8) 30 % ) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of 125 and 68 kDa proteins ( Fig . 3 ) , which we have previously identiﬁed as FAK and paxil - lin , respectively , by using anti - focal adhesion kinase F - actin , anti - phosphorylated FAK , and anti - paxillin an - tibodies . In addition , we have also shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins is a downstream Figure 1 . Presence of integrin subtypes in HUVECs .

Cells were treated with anti - integrin (cid:1) 2 ( clone A2 - IIE10 , 10 (cid:3) g / ml , 60 min ) , (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 ( clone JBS5 , 5 (cid:3) g / ml , 30 min ) , (cid:1) 6 ( clone NKI - GoH3 , 10 (cid:3) g / ml , 60 min ) , (cid:1) v ( clone AV1 , 10 (cid:3) g / ml , 60 min ) , and (cid:2) 4 ( clone ASC - 3 , 10 (cid:3) g / ml , 60 min ) antibodies at 37°C . Cells were lysed before or after applying (cid:8) 30 % HTS for indicated period and centrifuged as described in Materials and Methods . Band densities of RhoA and (cid:2) - actin were measured in membrane fraction , and RhoA / (cid:2) - actin values were expressed relative to that of iso - tonic control . Note that anti - integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 Ab , but not other antibodies , completely suppressed the HTS - induced change in RhoA expression in membrane fraction . Representative RhoA band images are shown in upper panel .

The FASEB Journal signal of RhoA activation in HUVECs ( 1 ) . Because the anti - integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 Ab inhibited the HTS - induced RhoA translocation ( Fig . 2 ) , we might also expect that this Ab would inhibit the HTS - induced tyrosine phosphoryla - tion . Indeed , the HTS - induced tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of 125 kDa FAK ( Fig . 3 A ) and 68 kDa paxillin ( Fig . 3 B ) was signiﬁcantly inhibited in HUVECs pretreated with the anti - integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 Ab but not by the anti - integrin (cid:1) 2 , (cid:1) 6 , (cid:1) v , and (cid:2) 4 antibodies ( Fig . 3 ) . Effects of integrin antibodies on HTS - induced ATP release in HUVECs As reported previously , the sequential activation of RhoA and FAK / paxillin leads to ATP release in HUVECs ( 1 ) . We have therefore also examined the effects of the anti - integrin antibodies on the HTS - induced ATP release , as assessed by the increase in [ ATP ] o . An exposure of control cells for 10 min to a (cid:8) 30 % hypotonic solution elevated [ ATP ] o to 62 . 3 (cid:6) 1 . 6 nM ( n (cid:9) 28 ) , a value that is signiﬁcantly higher than that of 18 . 2 (cid:6) 0 . 5 nM ( n (cid:9) 29 ) during a 10 min exposure to isotonic solution ( Fig . 4 A ) . None of the anti - integrin antibodies affected the values of [ ATP ] o in isotonic solution ( P (cid:10) 0 . 05 vs . untreated control ; Fig . 4 A ) . In contrast , the anti - integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 Ab signiﬁcantly inhib - ited the HTS - induced increase in [ ATP ] o ( 28 . 9 (cid:6) 1 . 1 nM , n (cid:9) 7 , P (cid:7) 0 . 01 vs . untreated control ) , but the anti - integrin (cid:1) 2 , (cid:1) 6 , (cid:1) v , or (cid:2) 4 antibodies did not affect the HTS - induced ATP release ( P (cid:10) 0 . 05 vs . untreated con - trol ; Fig . 4 A ) . Effects of integrin antibodies on HTS - induced actin reorganization We have also demonstrated that HTS induces a tran - sient reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton , which occurs in parallel with the ATP release ( 1 , 18 ) . Dense actin ﬁbers reached a maximum level 2 min after starting HTS and then converged into peripheral ad - hesion complexes after 10 min ( Fig . 4 B ) .

Representative band images are shown in upper panels . Densitometric analysis of phosphorylated tyrosine bands revealed that anti - integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 Ab abolished HTS - induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both proteins ( lower panels ) .

Therefore , these results suggest that integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 plays a central role in sensing HTS and evoking intracellular signals and responses in HUVECs Effects of integrin antibodies on LPA - induced responses in HUVECs As reported previously , LPA mimicked all of the HTS - induced intracellular signals and responses in HUVECs ( 1 ) . In the present study , we ﬁrst conﬁrmed the LPA increased [ ATP ] o in untreated control cells ( LPA , 49 . 5 (cid:6) 2 . 4 nM , n (cid:9) 12 ; without LPA , 19 . 6 (cid:6) 3 . 3 nM , n (cid:9) 12 ; P (cid:7) 0 . 01 ; Fig . 5 A ) . However , unlike the HTS - induced ATP release , this LPA - induced [ ATP ] o increase was not inhibited by the anti - integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 Ab ( with LPA , 44 . 7 (cid:6) 2 . 2 nM , n (cid:9) 4 ; without LPA , 26 . 6 (cid:6) 5 . 7 nM , n (cid:9) 4 ; both P (cid:10) 0 . 05 vs . control ; Fig . 5 A ) . Anti - integrin (cid:1) 2 , (cid:1) 6 , (cid:1) v , and (cid:2) 4 antibodies also did not affect the LPA - induced increase in [ ATP ] o ( Fig . 5 A ) . LPA also induced a transient reorganization of actin ﬁlaments in control cells ( Fig . 5 Ba ) and its time course was similar to the HTS - induced one , i . e . , actin ﬁbers appeared after 2 min and converged into peripheral local adhesion complexes in 10 min . The anti - integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 Ab did not interfere with the LPA - induced actin reorganization ( Fig . 5 Bb ) . Furthermore , anti - integrin (cid:1) 2 , (cid:1) 6 , (cid:1) v , and (cid:2) 4 antibodies also did not affect LPA - induced actin reorganization ( not shown ) . There - fore , these results suggest that integrins do not play any role in the LPA - induced responses in HUVECs . DISCUSSION The present study shows that the HTS - induced mem - brane translocation of RhoA ( Fig . 2 ) , tyrosine phos - phorylation of FAK and paxillin ( Fig . 3 ) , ATP release ( Fig . 4 A ) , and actin reorganization ( Fig . 4 B ) in HUVECs are suppressed by the anti - integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 Ab . These effects were not due to nonspeciﬁc effects of the Figure 4 . Effects of anti - integrin antibodies on HTS - induced ATP release and actin reorgani - zation . A ) Extracellular ATP concentration ( [ ATP ] o ) was measured 10 min after changing to luciferin - luciferase - containing isotonic or (cid:8) 30 % hypotonic solutions . Anti - integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 Ab but not anti - integrin (cid:1) 2 , (cid:1) 6 , (cid:1) v , or (cid:2) 4 antibodies suppressed HTS - induced increase in [ ATP ] o . Note that [ ATP ] o in isotonic solution was not affected by any of these anti - integrin antibodies . * * P (cid:7) 0 . 01 vs . hypotonic control . B ) Transient actin reorganization was induced by (cid:8) 30 % HTS in control cells ( upper panels ) . Maximum of dense actin ﬁbers was observed at 2 min and converged into peripheral bundles in 10 min . Formation of actin ﬁbers was not observed in anti - integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 Ab - treated cells , whereas it was normally observed in cells treated with anti - integrin (cid:1) 2 , (cid:1) 6 , (cid:1) v , or (cid:2) 4 antibodies ( lower panels ) . Scales (cid:9) 50 (cid:3) m . 1996 Vol . 20 October 2006 HIRAKAWA ET AL . The FASEB Journal treatment with Ab , since higher concentrations of the blocking antibodies against integrin (cid:1) 2 , (cid:1) 6 , (cid:1) v , and (cid:2) 4 subunits did not affect any of these HTS - induced intracellular signals and responses . We have previously reported that HTS induces a sequential activation of RhoA / Rho - kinase and FAK / paxillin and that the acti - vation of this cascade leads to ATP release and actin reorganization ( 1 ) . The present results , therefore , in - dicate that the activation of integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 is located upstream of these HTS - induced sequential responses . In addition to their involvement in cell attachment and migration , integrins have been supposed to play a role in endothelial mechanotransduction ( 16 ) . Urbich et al . ( 11 ) reported that integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 mediates the shear stress - induced cell migration and the activation of MAPK , Akt , and FAK in HUVECs . In contrast , Tzima et al . ( 10 ) reported that the shear stress - induced activa - tion of integrin (cid:1) v (cid:2) 3 in bovine aortic endothelial cells leads to a transient suppression of Rho activity and disruption of actin ﬁlaments . Other groups also re - ported the involvement of integrin (cid:2) 1 subunit ( 19 , 20 ) and (cid:1) v (cid:2) 3 ( 19 ) in shear stress - mediated responses in endothelium . Integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 and (cid:1) v (cid:2) 3 share the same extracellular matrix ligand , ﬁbronectin , and it was reported that the interaction between these integrins and ﬁbronectin was required for the shear stress - induced association of integrin with the adapter pro - tein Shc in HUVECs ( 21 ) . Therefore , both (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 and (cid:1) v (cid:2) 3 integrins may play a role in endothelial mechano - transduction . However , as described in the present study , the clone AV1 of the anti - integrin (cid:1) v Ab , which was developed using human integrin (cid:1) v (cid:2) 3 as an im - munogen and was shown to successfully block integrin (cid:1) v (cid:2) 3 - mediated cell adhesion ( 22 ) , did not affect any of the HTS - induced responses in HUVECs . Our conclu - sion is therefore that integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 plays a pivotal role in the HTS - induced responses in HUVECs . We have shown in a previous study that LPA mim - icked the HTS - induced responses ( 1 ) . It is well estab - lished that LPA binds to its speciﬁc receptors and activates RhoA via LPA 1 and LPA 2 receptors ( 23 ) , but evidence for the involvement of integrins in the activa - tion of LPA receptors has not been presented so far . However , since none of the anti - integrin antibodies Figure 5 . Effects of anti - integrin antibodies on LPA - induced ATP release and actin reorganiza - tion . A ) LPA induced increase in [ ATP ] o , mea - sured for 10 min , in isotonic solution . Anti - integrin (cid:1) 2 , (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 , (cid:1) 6 , (cid:1) v , or (cid:2) 4 antibodies did not affect LPA - induced increase in [ ATP ] o . B ) Transient reorganization of actin was in - duced by LPA in control cells ( Ba ) . Unlike HTS - induced actin reorganization , anti - integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 Ab did not affect LPA - induced actin reor - ganization ( Bb ) . Scales (cid:9) 50 (cid:3) m . 1997 ROLES OF INTEGRIN IN HYPOTONIC RESPONSES examined in this study suppressed the LPA - induced ATP release ( Fig . 5 A ) and actin reorganization ( Fig . 5 B ) , it is unlikely that they are involved in the activation of LPA receptors . Various candidate mechanosensing molecules , such as heparan sulfate proteoglycan ( 24 ) , or molecular complexes , including PECAM - 1 , cad - herin , and VEGFR2 , have been proposed for endothe - lium ( 25 ) . If they are also involved in HTS - induced responses , these sensor molecules may activate integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 and intracellular signals originating from RhoA activation . Therefore , the present results indicate that LPA and HTS induce identical intracellular signals and that only a few initial mechanosensing molecules , in - cluding integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 and LPA receptor ( s ) , are actu - ally stimulus - speciﬁc ( Fig . 6 ) . ATP release has been considered as one of the central mechanosensitive responses in endothelium ( 15 ) and also in other cell types ( 26 – 28 ) . ATP release is not only evoked by hypotonic cell swelling ( 15 ) but also by shear stress ( 29 ) and membrane stretch ( 27 ) . The present study revealed for the ﬁrst time that integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 is involved in HTS - induced ATP release . Al - though we did not examine the possible role of integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 in the ATP release induced by other mechanical stresses , its involvement might be likely since this particular subtype of integrin has been reported to mediate shear stress - induced responses in vascular en - dothelium ( 10 , 11 , 16 , 21 , 30 ) . ATP release is also induced by nonmechanical stimuli , such as agonist stimulation ( 31 ) , third generation (cid:2) blockers ( 32 ) , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ; 33 ) , and LPA ( 1 ) in vascular endothelium , but until now it has not been clear whether these responses are mediated by the same pathways as the mechanosensitive ATP release . The results shown in this study and in our previous report ( 1 ) may resolve this issue : ATP release is one of the common endothelial responses evoked by RhoA - medi - ated intracellular signals , and any stimulus that evokes these signals would also induce ATP release . In conclu - sion , HTS - induced but not LPA - induced responses are mediated by integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 , and therefore integrin (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 plays a pivotal role in the initiation of HTS - induced responses in HUVECs .
