However , RNA replication can be impeded by the extraordinary stability of 31 duplex RNA products , which must be dissociated for re - initiation of the next replication cycle . 32 Here we have explored rolling circle synthesis ( RCS ) as a potential solution to this strand 33 separation problem . RCS on small circular RNAs - as indicated by molecular dynamics 34 simulations - induces a progressive build - up of conformational strain with destabilisation of 35 nascent strand 5’ and 3’ ends . At the same time , we observe sustained RCS by a triplet 36 polymerase ribozyme on small circular RNAs over multiple orbits with strand displacement 37 yielding concatemeric RNA products . Furthermore , we show RCS of a circular Hammerhead 38 ribozyme capable of self - cleavage and re - circularisation . Thus , all steps of a viroid - like RNA 39 replication pathway can be catalysed by RNA alone . Our results have implications for the 40 emergence of RNA replication and for understanding the potential of RNA to support complex 41 genetic processes . 42 43 44 45 46 Key words : origin of life , rolling circle , rolling circle synthesis , circular RNA , circular nucleic 47 acids , ribozymes , hammerhead , persistence length , RNA molecular dynamics simulation . 48 Page 3 of 39 Introduction 49 The versatility of RNA functions underpins hypotheses regarding the origin and early evolution 50 of life . Such hypotheses of an “RNA world” – a primordial biology centred on RNA as the main 51 biomolecule - are in accord with the essential role of RNA catalysis in present day biology 52 ( Cech , 2000 ; Goldman and Kacar , 2021 ; Nissen et al . , 2000 ; Wilkinson et al . , 2020 ) and the 53 discovery of multiple prebiotic synthetic pathways to several of the RNA ( and DNA ) 54 nucleotides ( Becker et al . , 2019 ; Kim et al . , 2020 ; Patel et al . , 2015 ; Powner et al . , 2009 ; Xu 55 et al . , 2020 ) . In addition , progress in both non - enzymatic ( Deguzman et al . , 2014 ; Hassenkam 56 et al . , 2020 ; Prywes et al . , 2016 ; Rajamani et al . , 2008 ; Wachowius and Holliger , 2019 ; Zhang 57 et al . , 2020 ; Zhou et al . , 2020 ) and RNA - catalysed polymerization of RNA and some of its 58 analogues ( Attwater et al . , 2018 , 2013 ; Cojocaru and Unrau , 2021 ; Ekland and Bartel , 1996 ; 59 Horning and Joyce , 2016 ; Johnston et al . , 2001 ; Mutschler et al . , 2018 ; Shechner et al . , 2009 ; 60 Tagami et al . , 2017 ; Tjhung et al . , 2020 ) is beginning to map out a plausible path to RNA self - 61 replication ; a cornerstone of the RNA world hypothesis . 62 63 RNA in vitro evolution and engineering have led to the discovery of RNA polymerase 64 ribozymes ( RPRs ) able perform templated RNA synthesis of up to ~ 200 nucleotides ( nt ) 65 ( Attwater et al . , 2018 ) , synthesizing active ribozymes including the catalytic class I ligase core 66 ( Horning and Joyce , 2016 ; Tjhung et al . , 2020 ) at the heart of the most efficient RPRs , as well 67 as initiate processive RNA synthesis using a mechanism with analogies to sigma - dependent 68 transcription initiation ( Cojocaru and Unrau , 2021 ) . A RPR capable of utilizing trinucleotide 69 triphosphates ( triplets ) as substrates ( a triplet polymerase ribozyme ( TPR ) ) has been shown 70 to display a much enhanced capacity to copy highly structured RNA templates including 71 segments of its own sequence ( Attwater et al . , 2018 ) . 72 73 Nevertheless , there remain a number of fundamental obstacles to be overcome before an 74 autonomous self - replication system can be established . A central problem among these is the 75 so called “strand inhibition problem” , a form of product inhibition due to the accumulation of 76 highly stable dead - end RNA duplexes , which cannot be dissociated ( efficiently ) under 77 replication conditions ( Le Vay and Mutschler , 2019 ) . The strand inhibition problem has been 78 overcome by ( PCR - like ) thermocycling ( or thermophoresis ) ( Horning and Joyce , 2016 ; Salditt 79 et al . , 2020 ) but this approach may be limited to short RNA oligomers ( even in the presence 80 of high concentrations of denaturing agents ) as the melting temperatures of longer RNA 81 duplexes approach or even exceed the boiling point of water ( Freier et al . , 1986 ; Szostak , 82 2012 ) . 83 84 Page 4 of 39 While RNA duplexes occur by necessity as intermediates of RNA replication , the extent of the 85 strand inhibition problem can be modulated by genome topology . Circular rather than linear 86 genomes are widespread in biology including eukaryotes , prokaryotes and viruses ( Møller et 87 al . , 2018 ; Moss et al . , 2020 ; Shulman and Davidson , 2017 ) . Circular RNAs ( circRNAs ) are 88 found as products of RNA splicing ( Kristensen et al . , 2019 ) and RNA - based self - circularization 89 is known in multiple ribozymes ( Hieronymus and Müller , 2019 ; Lasda and Parker , 2014 ; 90 Petkovic and Müller , 2015 ) . Templated RNA synthesis on circular templates ( Rolling Circle 91 Synthesis ( RCS ) ) is also widespread and found in the replication of the RNA genomes in some 92 viruses and in viroids . Indeed , viroid RNA replication has been proposed to resemble an 93 ancient mechanisms for replication ( Diener , 1989 ; Flores et al . , 2014 ) . RCS has potentially 94 unique properties with regards to the strand inhibition problem where RNA duplex melting in 95 principle can be effected by continuous toehold strand displacement driven by nucleotide 96 hybridization and the ratchet of nascent strand extension by triphosphate hydrolysis . In an 97 idealized RCS mechanism , such strand invasion and displacement processes are both 98 isoenergetic and coordinated to nascent strand extension ( Blanco et al . , 1989 ; Daubendiek et 99 al . , 1995 ) , with rotation of the single - stranded RNA ( ssRNA ) preventing the build - up of 100 topological tension ( Kuhn et al . , 2002 ) . Thus RCS is a potentially open - ended process leading 101 to the synthesis of single - stranded multiple repeat products ( concatemers ) with an internally 102 energized strand displacement circumventing the “strand inhibition problem” ( Tupper and 103 Higgs , 2021 ) . 104 105 Here we have explored RCS of small circular RNA ( scRNA ) templates as a potential solution 106 to the strand inhibition problem in RNA - catalysed RNA replication . We show that RCS can be 107 catalysed by a TPR , which is able to perform continuous templated extension of circular RNA 108 templates for multiple cycles yielding concatemeric repeat products . We also explore the 109 mechanistic basis for RCS and strand displacement by molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations 110 of scRNA in explicit solvent . Finally , we explore the potential of a full viroid – like replication 111 cycle catalysed by RNA by design and synthesis of a circular Hammerhead ribozyme capable 112 of both product cleavage and self - circularization . 113 Page 5 of 39 Results 114 RNA - catalysed primer extension using small circular RNA templates . 115 We first set out to investigate whether templated RNA synthesis on scRNAs could be 116 catalysed by an RNA catalyst . To extend beyond the full circle and initiate RCS requires duplex 117 invasion and displacement of the original RNA product strand . However , most RPRs are 118 inhibited by duplex RNA both in the form of template secondary structures and as linear duplex 119 RNA . We therefore explored the potential of a recently described TPR ( Attwater et al . , 2018 ) , 120 which is able to utilize triphosphorylated trinucleotides ( triplets ( ppp NNN ) ) as substrates for 121 polymerization . Due to increased binding of the triplets to the template ( compared e . g . to the 122 canonical mononucleotide triphosphates ( NTPs ) ) , triplets are able to invade and cooperatively 123 “open up” template secondary structures for replication ( Attwater et al . , 2018 ) . We 124 hypothesized that this ability might also promote the continuous invasion of the opposing 125 strand and facilitate the RCS mechanism ( Figure 1A ) . Similar to what was described 126 previously , RNA synthesis by the TPR best in the eutectic phase of water ice , due to beneficial 127 reaction conditions for ribozyme catalysis such as reduced RNA hydrolysis and high ionic and 128 RNA substrate concentrations ( Attwater et al . , 2010 ) . This was also the case on scRNA 129 templates . 130 131 We prepared scRNA templates ( 34 - 58 nt in length ) by in vitro transcription and ligation and 132 confirmed circularity by resistance to exonuclease degradation in contrast to the linear , non - 133 ligated counterparts ( Figure 1B , Figure 1 - Figure supplement 1 , see sequences for all 134 oligonucleotides in Supplementary file 1 ) . On these , we first investigated primer extensions 135 using just a single triplet ( ppp GAA ) as this provides an even banding pattern of incorporation 136 facilitating analysis allowing primer extension efficiencies of linear and circular templates to 137 be more readily compared ( Figure 1C ) . Primer extension experiments using a purified 36 nt 138 scRNA as template resulted in full - length extension around the circle ( Figure 1D ) , but with 139 reduced efficiency compared to a linear RNA template . Furthermore , we observed a periodic 140 pattern of extension efficiency for the triplet junctions in agreement with the helical pitch of 141 double - stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) ( 11 . 3 base pairs ( bp ) / turn ( Bhattacharyya et al . , 1990 ) ) ( Figure 142 1E ) . Presumably , triplet junctions located on the inside of the scRNA ring are less well 143 accessible and therefore less efficiently ligated than in linear RNA , which is freely accessible 144 from all sides ( Figure 1F ) . In turn , this leads to the observed periodicity and reduced synthetic 145 efficiency on scRNAs . 146 147 Page 6 of 39 148 Figure 1 ) Primer extension on circular RNA templates .

F ) Schematic model of 157 scRNA illustrating the different accessibility of in - or outside facing ligation junctions showing the scRNA 158 template ( blue ) , P9 primer ( red ) and the product strand ( light grey ) . Original gel images and numerical 159 values are supplied in Figure 1 - source data 1 . 160 161 Despite the reduced extension efficiency in scRNA , we obtained full circle extension products 162 for multiple templates ( 34 to 58 nt in size , Figure 2A , B ) with a clear trend towards increasing 163 mean extension efficiency for circular templates with increasing size predicting parity with the 164 linear template at around 120 nt ( Figure 2C ) . Note , in these experiments extension beyond 165 full circle was not intended or possible ( lane 1 to 6 in Figure 2B ) as the specific triplet 166 substrates needed for displacing the primer were not present in the reaction . 167 168 Page 7 of 39 Having established full - length synthesis on scRNA templates , we next tested if primer 169 extension could proceed beyond full circle requiring duplex invasion and displacement of the 170 primer / product strand . We first tested this using primer P10 + 3 , comprising a 5’ extension of 171 three GAA repeats , thus covering the last three UUC triplet binding sites on the circular 172 templates ( Figure 2B top right ) . We observed a extension of up to three bands above the full 173 circle mark ( Figure 2B lane 7 - 12 ) , indicating displacement of the primer 5’ - end upon 174 incorporation of three additional pppGAA triplets . This showed that “beyond full circle” 175 synthesis including strand displacement is possible on scRNA templates boding well for the 176 implementation of full RCS . To that effect , we next optimized buffer and extension conditions 177 for more efficient extension above the full circle mark ( Figure 2 - Figure supplement 1 ) . 178 Interestingly , greater dilution of reaction mixtures prior to freezing resulted in more efficient 179 stand displacement . Greater dilution does not alter the final solute concentrations within the 180 eutectic phase ( Attwater et al . , 2010 ) but increases the eutectic phase / ice interface area . 181 This suggest that strand invasion may be aided by surface effects , as previously suggested 182 for RNA refolding ( Mutschler et al . , 2015 ) . Under these optimized buffer and extension 183 conditions , we observed progressive accumulation of longer and longer RCS products , over 184 prolonged reaction times ( up to 6 weeks ) ( Figure 2D ) with reaction speed decreasing after ca . 185 4 weeks incubation , indicating continued RCS over extended periods of time ( Figure 2E , F ) . 186 187 Page 8 of 39 188 Page 9 of 39 Figure 2 ) Full - length and beyond full - length RNA - catalysed RNA synthesis on circular RNA 189 templates .

For simplicity , a 36 210 nt circular RNA sequence of ( UUC ) 12 was chosen as a template strand ( similar to the scRNA 211 template in Figure 1 , 2D ) for direct comparison with the experimental system . The 212 complementary strand comprising GAA triplets starting from 9 bp dsRNA ( corresponding to 213 binding of primer P 9 ) was extended ( in triplet increments ) from 18 , 21 , 24 , 27 till 30 bp of 214 dsRNA ( corresponding to extension products in bands 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 in the gel in Figure 1D ) , 215 using the most representative structure of the previous simulation as a starting point for the 216 next one . 217 The simulation trajectories revealed the high energy barrier of dsRNA for bending and 218 accommodating a circular shape ( Figure 3A ) . Instead , we observe that , as dsRNA is 219 elongated , the remaining ssRNA segment of the scRNA becomes increasingly extended . As 220 the dsRNA part reaches 27 bp ( corresponding to band 6 in Figure 1C ) , the ssRNA segment 221 was fully extended and torsional strain was relieved by dissociation ( “peeling off” ) of the 222 dsRNA 5’ and 3’ ends rather than by bending or the introduction of kinks into the dsRNA 223 segment ( Figure 3B ) . Subsequently , multiple peeling off and rebinding events were observed 224 during the trajectories indicating that the dynamics of this process are fast ( Supplementary 225 Movie 1 and 2 ) . 226 227 In the experimental data , we observed a larger than expected inhibitory effect for insertion of 228 the final triplets ( extension to 33 and 36 nt of dsRNA , bands 8 and 9 in Figure 2D into the 229 corresponding scRNA template ) . This may reflect the onset of the 3’ and 5’ end destabilization 230 observed in simulations ( Figure 3 ) , which would likely attenuate primer extension by the 231 Page 10 of 39 ribozyme . Our data shows a further slowdown in triplet incorporation when RCS is extended 232 beyond full circle . We hypothesize that this might be caused by rebinding of the displaced 233 strand on the template and interference with ribozyme extension . According to our simulations , 234 the displaced strand would be > 9 nt and , thus , long enough to reach the template strand and 235 hybridize to the complementary repetitive sequence . 236 237 As a control for the observed dsRNA end destabilization mechanism , we also ran a simulation 238 of a linear RNA molecule containing four triplets and a nick between two of them , but observed 239 neither base opening nor dissociation at any strand end ( Figure 3 - Figure supplement 1 ) . 240 Groove dimensions and local helical parameters ( roll , twist and slide ) for the RCS simulations 241 on circular RNA did not show any major adjustment compared with the linear RNA control 242 ( Figure 3 - Figure supplement 2 ) . We observed an oscillation of high / low values of bending 243 along the molecule in phase with RNA - turn periodicity in an attempt to create an overall 244 curvature ( Velasco - Berrelleza et al . , 2020 ) , although with moderate success ( ~ 60 º on an arc 245 length of 30 bp of dsRNA ) and no formation of kinks or other disruption of the canonical A - 246 form typical of the RNA duplex ( Figure 3 - Figure supplement 2 ) . 247 248 To mirror the experimental eutectic phase conditions , simulations were run at relatively high 249 Mg 2 + concentrations ( 100 mM ) and compared with the presence of monovalent ions like K + 250 ( 200 mM ) and high concentration of Mg 2 + ( 500 mM ) , but simulations did not show any major 251 differences in terms of melting or dsRNA bending ( Figure 3 - Figure supplement 1 , 2 ) . 252 However , Mg 2 + compared to K + makes more stable interactions with different parts of the RNA 253 and , consequently , may increase the probability of distorted conformations facilitating the 254 exposition of nucleobases at the 5’ and 3’ ends . On the contrary , K + counter ions are mainly 255 positioned along the major and minor groove , allowing the bases to orient towards the inside 256 of the dsRNA helix for base - pairing interactions ( Figure 3C and Figure 3 - Figure supplement 257 3 ) . The role of Mg 2 + in the stabilization of complex RNA folding has been observed repeatedly 258 in several structures ( Sponer et al . , 2018 ) , like the ribosome ( Klein et al . , 2004 ) and the 259 Hepatitis delta virus ribozyme ( Nakano et al . , 2001 ) . Increasing MgCl 2 concentration to 500 260 mM does not seem to bring extra benefit , as the system appears to be saturated already at 261 100 mM Mg 2 + ( Figure 3 - Figure supplement 3 , 4 ) . 262 Page 11 of 39 In summary , our simulations support the notion that a circular RNA template ( in the presence 263 of Mg 2 + ions ) leads to increased dynamics of nucleobase exposure , RNA duplex 264 destabilization and 5’ and 3’ end melting , which may facilitate strand displacement during RNA 265 replication . The simulations clearly show the implausibility of a small circular fully dsRNA 266 molecule ( as schematically illustrated in Figure 1E ) due to the prohibitive energetic cost of 267 bending of the dsRNA . Instead , the system appears to relieve internal strain by extending the 268 ssRNA segment of the circle ( partially shielding the dsRNA segment ) and peeling of both 269 dsRNA 5’ and 3’ ends ( Figure 3 ) , consistent with the helical period of triplet extension observed 270 ( Figure 1 , 2 ) ( with ligation junctions facing into the ssRNA centre being less accessible ) and 271 the observed reduction in RCS efficiency . Dynamic destabilization of dsRNA 5’ ends may aid 272 continuous extension of the 3’ end ( RCS ) and would be predicted to manifest itself in RNA 273 circles up to 200 bp as suggested by RNA persistence length ( Abels et al . , 2005 ) . 274 275 Figure 3 ) Molecular dynamics simulation of circular RNA .

To this 288 end , we designed barcoded templates that would allow us to distinguish TPR - made RNA 289 products arising from non - templated terminal transferase ( TT ) activity from those from 290 templated RCS by sequencing . The barcoded small RNA templates ( termed A - D ) were 291 prepared either as circular or linear RNAs comprising different internal triplet “barcodes” ( at 292 position 3 , 6 and 9 ) of variable GC - content for individual identification ( Figure 4A and Figure 293 4 - Figure supplement 1 ) . On these , we performed one - pot primer extension experiments , in 294 which all four templates ( either A - D linear or A - D circular ) were mixed in equal proportions . 295 After gel electrophoresis , the area above full - length extension products were excised , RNA 296 recovered , and sequenced ( Figure 4 - Figure supplement 1 ) . 297 298 Analysis of the sequencing products from the one - pot reaction showed template - dependent 299 high - fidelity RNA synthesis up to full length ( position 9 ) for all templates ( linear and circular ) 300 ( Figure 4B ) . Further , all templates gave longer than full - length products indicative of continued 301 RNA synthesis by the TPR after full length ( positions > 9 ) . However , the fidelity dropped after 302 full length indicative of significant non - templated terminal transferase - like ( TT ) activity in this 303 regime ( Figure 4B ) . For example , the average fidelity for insertion of the expected triplet 304 ( ppp GAA ) for position 10 ( full length + 1 ) for circular templates was 10 . 9 % whereas for position 305 9 ( full length ) it was 89 . 9 % . For linear templates , the fidelity for full length + 1 dropped to 0 . 7 % 306 compared to full length 78 . 8 % . Note , that fidelity at full length + 1 dropped much more for linear 307 than for circular templates . For this reason , the probability of a product extending to longer 308 than full length ( positions 10 - 12 ) with the correct sequence was many fold higher for circular 309 compared to linear RNA templates ( Figure 4C ) . A few events of blunt - end ligation with other 310 template / product strands ( see e . g . position 15 for linear template C and D ) ( Figure 4B ) were 311 also observed for linear templates . 312 313 On all circular templates ( with the exception of template B , where too few reads were obtained ) 314 extension beyond full length ( while containing a significant TT component ) continued to insert 315 the barcode triplets correctly , indicating continuous RCS at least up to position 18 ( 63 nt , more 316 than 1 . 5 “orbits” on the scRNA template ) . 317 Page 13 of 39 318 Page 14 of 39 Figure 4 ) RNA - catalysed RNA synthesis beyond full length for circular templates .

D ) Model illustrating ( 1 . ) beyond full - 328 length extension on a circular template ( templated RCS ) and ( 2 . ) on a linear template ( non - templated ) . 329 Full analysis of the data in Figure 4B is supplied in Figure 4 - source data 1 . 330 331 Control experiments , with individually incubated templates ( in contrast to the one - pot 332 experiments ) mixed after gel purification , showed essentially identical results ( Figure 4 - 333 Figure supplement 2A ) . Interestingly , non - diluted samples had a decreased fidelity at position 334 10 ( the point of strand invasion ) compared to diluted samples ( Figure 4 - Figure supplement 335 2B ) suggesting that dilution appears to aid not only extension efficiency ( Figure 2 - Figure 336 supplement 1D ) , but also strand invasion fidelity and continued templated synthesis . In 337 summary , these results are consistent with RNA - catalysed RCS on scRNA templates beyond 338 the full circle . 339 340 Multiple repeat rolling circle products 341 Next we sought to test if RCS efficiency could be increased by double priming on the circular 342 template , an approach known as branched RCS ( Berr and Schubert , 2006 ) . Indeed , we 343 observed a higher degree of RCS with a 36 nt scRNA template ( 8211 ) having two identical 344 primer sites leading to two different products being formed ( product I or II ) ( Figure 5A , B ) . In 345 order to test the primer site functionality individually we used different triplet combinations 346 ( Figure 5B ) . When only the ppp GAA triplet was present , primers were extended only by two 347 triplets as expected ( lane 1 in Figure 5B ) ( with a small amount of non - templated TT 348 incorporation of a 3rd triplet ) . When ppp GAA and ppp AUA or ppp GCG triplets were added , 349 respectively ( lane 2 or 3 in Figure 5B ) , products extended up to 5 triplet - incorporations with 350 extension stopping at triplet 6 ( coding for CUG ) showing that both primer sites were 351 functioning . Finally , when all triplets ( ppp GAA , ppp AUA , ppp GCG , ppp CUG ) were present , 352 extension continued to beyond full circle ( positions ≥10 ) ( Figure 5B ) and bands corresponding 353 to extension products exceeding two whole orbits ( > triplet 21 ( 63nt ) ) of replication were 354 observed ( Figure 5C ) . 355 356 Page 15 of 39 357 Page 16 of 39 Figure 5 ) RNA - catalysed branched RCS .

Original gel images and full analysis of the 366 data in Figure 5D are supplied in Figure 5 - source data 1 . 367 368 Sequencing of the long , branched RCS RNA products ( excised from band ≥15 triplets , Figure 369 5 - Figure supplement 1 ) identified a range of long reads ( from both products I and II ) including 370 many reads of the product with 15 correct triplet incorporations ( Figure 5E ) representing ~ 1 . 5 371 orbits ( n : 7x10 3 and 1x10 5 reads of Product I and II , respectively ) . However , much longer 372 sequences were present in decreasing numbers of reads , with the longest products 373 comprising 29 correct triplet incorporations ( 96 nt ) ( n = 2 ) representing RCS of more than 2 . 5 374 orbits and the longest reported product synthesised by the TPR . Thus , RNA - catalysed RCS 375 has the potential to yield extended RNA concatemer products under isothermal conditions . 376 Freeze - thaw ( FT ) cycles have been shown to enhance ribozyme activity by effecting RNA 377 refolding ( Mutschler et al . , 2015 ) and indeed inclusion of 4 FT cycles lead to more efficient 378 production of longer RCS RNA products ( Figure 5B and C ) . In summary , isothermal conditions 379 allow RCS of long concatemeric products containing multiple ( > 2 . 5 ) copies of the scRNA 380 template with RCS efficiency further enhanced by FT cycling . 381 382 Proto - viroid like self - circularizing ribozyme 383 A number of biological systems including viroids uses an RCS strategy for genome replication . 384 However , RCS synthesis of RNA concatemers is only one part of the viroid replication cycle , 385 which also involves resection ( i . e . cleavage ) of the concatemer into individual units and 386 circularisation of unit length RNAs by ligation to recreate the original circular RNA genome . 387 As both RNA cleavage and RNA ligation can be efficiently catalysed by RNA , we sought to 388 investigate if a viroid - like replication cycle might be catalysed by RNA alone . To this end , we 389 designed a proto - viroid RNA comprising a 39 nt scRNA template encoding a designed micro - 390 hammerhead ribozyme ( µHHz ) as well as its substrate for cleavage ( Figure 6A ) . The µHHz 391 could be synthesized by the TPR ( Figure 6B ) . Furthermore , the µHHz could catalyse both self - 392 cleavage ( forming a 2’ , 3’ cyclic phosphate ( > p ) ) and re - ligation leading to circularization ( under 393 RCS reaction conditions at - 7 o C in eutectic ice ) ( Figure 6C , lane 2 ) . A similar equilibrium 394 between cleavage and ligation in eutectic ice had previously been observed for the unrelated 395 hairpin ribozyme ( Mutschler et al . , 2015 ) . 396 Page 17 of 39 397 Figure 6 ) Steps of a viroid - like replication cycle catalysed by RNA alone .

D ) Schematic illustration of the RNA - catalysed viroid - like 402 replication with steps comprising RNA - catalysed combined RCS ( 1 - 3 ) , resection ( 4 , 5 ) and self - 403 circularization . ( 6 , 7 ) . Original gel images are supplied in Figure 6 - source data 1 . 404 405 Page 18 of 39 When the µHHz had been 5’ - phosphorylated ( Figure 6C , lane 3 ) only cleavage but no 406 circularization was seen , as phosphorylation blocks the 5’ - hydroxyl nucleophile for re - ligation 407 ( see steps 5 and 6 , Figure 6D ) . To the best of our knowledge , the µHHrz is the smallest ( 39 408 nt ) self - cleaving and - circularizing RNA system reported to date and the first time self - 409 circularization has been shown in a Hammerhead ribozyme . Kinetic analysis of the cleavage 410 and circularization reaction show a slow but accumulating amount of cleavage product as a 411 function of time ( black points in Figure 6 - Figure supplement 1A ) . Analysing the ratio between 412 linear ( cleaved ) and circular ( ligated ) products ( Figure 6 - Figure supplement 1 ) showed that 413 the proportion of circle was initially very high ( approx . 40 % after 0 . 5 day ) . Based on this , it is 414 likely that all or most µHHz molecules are transiently circular at some point immediately after 415 cleavage , but become progressively trapped in a state unable to re - ligate , most likely due to 416 hydrolysis of the > p or misfolding . While only completing half of a full replication cycle 417 ( formation of a ( + ) - strand scRNA from a ( - ) - strand scRNA template , these results outline the 418 potential for a full viroid - like rolling circle RNA replication cycle based on RNA - catalysis alone . 419 Page 19 of 39 Discussion 420 Viroids are transcriptional - parasites composed entirely of a circular RNA genome and are 421 considered the simplest infectious pathogens known in nature . They lack protein coding 422 regions in their genome , and can be completely replicated in ribosome - free conditions ( Daròs 423 et al . , 1994 ; Diener , 2003 ; Fadda et al . , 2003 ; Flores et al . , 2009 ) . They can comprise a circular 424 RNA genome of as little as ~ 300 nt in e . g . Avsunviroidae encoding a Hammerhead ribozyme 425 responsible for maturation by resecting the RNA genome ( Flores et al . , 2000 ) . The resected 426 viroid genome is then ligated ( circularized ) by a host protein ( e . g . tRNA ligase ) ( Nohales et 427 al . , 2012 ) . Due to the simplicity of this replication strategy , viroids have been suggested to 428 represent possible “relics” from a primordial RNA - based biology ( Diener , 1989 ; Flores et al . , 429 2014 ) . Indeed circular RNA genomes would present a number of potential advantages for 430 prebiotic RNA replication , including increased stability by end protection ( Litke and Jaffrey , 431 2019 ) , a reduced requirement for specific primer oligonucleotides to sustain replication 432 ( Attwater et al . , 2018 ; Szostak , 2012 ) or resolve the end replication problem , i . e . the loss of 433 genetic information from incomplete replication in linear genomes . Circular RNA structures 434 self - assemble from RNA mononucleotides through wet - dry cycling ( Hassenkam et al . , 2020 ) 435 and a virtual circular genome has been suggested as a model for primordial RNA replication 436 ( Zhou et al . , 2021 ) . Thus , Viroid - like systems are likely candidates to have emerged as the 437 simplest Darwinian systems even before self - replication . 438 439 Here we have explored to what extent such a potentially prebiotic replication strategy can be 440 carried out with RNA alone . Our data shows that RNA can indeed facilitate RCS on scRNA 441 templates yielding concatemeric RNA products , which can be processed ( i . e . resected ) and 442 recircularized by an encoded ribozyme in a scheme reminiscent of viroid replication . Thus , 443 one half of full a viroid replication cycle ( ( - ) - strand replication leading to a self - circularizing ( + ) - 444 strand ) can be carried out by just two ribozymes . 445 Completing the viroid replication cycle would require the reverse ( + ) - strand replication leading 446 to a self - circularizing ( - ) - strand product and may require a second ribozyme ( e . g . a second 447 µHHrz ) encoded in the ( - ) - strand akin to the mechanism used by natural viroids ( Flores et al . , 448 2000 ) . 449 450 MD simulations indicate that the RCS process is aided by accumulating strain in the nascent 451 dsRNA segment leading to increased peeling off of dsRNA 5’ and 3’ ends ( i . e . strand 452 displacement ) . In turn , this peeling off creates a more dynamic environment potentially aiding 453 5’ end invasion by extending the 3’ end . This topological strain induced strand displacement 454 may be general and independent of the precise RCS mechanism on scRNA templates and 455 thus should also apply to non - enzymatic polymerization of RNA . Our observation that RCS 456 Page 20 of 39 can be enhanced by the use of branched extension , freeze - thaw thermocycling and pre - 457 freezing dilution may also relate to this . While the precise mechanistic basis for these 458 enhancements is currently unknown , it seems plausible that all of these enhance 5’ product 459 strand end displacement by accelerating conformational equilibration through RNA un - and 460 refolding as observed previously ( Mutschler et al . , 2015 ) . 461 462 In biology , both viroids and Hepatitis D virus ( HDV ) replication proceeds through RCS on 463 circular RNA genomes mediated by proteinaceous RNA polymerases but RCS has also been 464 reported for circular DNA templates and proteinaceous DNA polymerases in nature 465 ( Wawrzyniak et al . , 2017 ) and in biotechnology ( Daubendiek et al . , 1995 ; Givskov et al . , 2016 ; 466 Kristoffersen et al . , 2017 ; Mohsen and Kool , 2016 ) . dsDNA persistence length is somewhat 467 shorter than dsRNA ( dsDNA : 45 - 50 nm ( 140 - 50 nt ) vs . dsRNA 60 nm ( 200 nt ) and stacking 468 interactions weaker than in dsRNA ( Kebbekus et al . , 1995 ; Svozil et al . , 2010 ) , therefore 469 dsDNA may more readily adopt a circular shape or kinks to alleviate build - up of strain or to 470 adopt strong bends ( Wolters and Wittig , 1989 ) , we would nevertheless expect the a similar 471 strand displacement effect would play part . Indeed , in both cases RCS proceeds efficiently for 472 circular genomes ranging from a few hundred nt to over 1 . 5kb ( Mohsen and Kool , 2016 ) . In 473 contrast , RNA - catalysed polymerization ( record of producing approx . 200 nt products 474 ( Attwater et al . , 2013 ) ) is currently limited to RCS on small RNA circles . A more efficient RNA - 475 catalysed RCS - based replication strategy will likely require improvements to the ribozyme 476 polymerase catalytic activity , speed and processivity as well as the design of the template . 477 Improvements to ribozyme polymerase processivity , which is known to be poor ( Johnston et 478 al . , 2001 ; Lawrence and Bartel , 2003 ) , might have the greatest impact and might be realized 479 either through e . g . tethering or other topological linkages to the circular template ( Cojocaru 480 and Unrau , 2021 ) . A more processive polymerase ribozyme should also result in less non - 481 templated triplet TT activity , which appears to be a consequence of slow RCS extension and 482 is likely aggravated by peeling off of the 3’ end . Thus more efficient RCS may also require the 483 stabilization of the 3’ end triplet junction in the ribozyme active site in the same way as primer 484 / nascent strand termini are stabilized within the active sites of proteinaceous RNA - and DNA 485 polymerase ( Chim et al . , 2018 ; Houlihan et al . , 2020 ) . Finally , introduction of secondary 486 structure motifs in the RNA nascent strand might drive increased 5’ dissociation ( e . g . through 487 formation of stable hairpin structures ) relieving strain at the 3’ - end . 488 Larger circular RNA templates might provide advantages for the RCS as they are less strained 489 and provide increased access to the internal face of the circle and might also be able to encode 490 the whole ribozyme itself . On the other hand , reduced torsional strain on the dsRNA would be 491 expected to reduce strand invasion and “peeling off” of the product strand . All of these factors 492 merit detailed investigation . 493 Page 21 of 39 494 In conclusion , our motivation for investigating RNA - catalysed RCS was as a potential solution 495 towards the so - called “strand inhibition problem” , the inhibition of RNA replication by 496 exceedingly stable RNA duplex products . This inhibition has not just a thermodynamic 497 component , i . e . the significant amount of energy required to melt such duplexes , but a kinetic 498 component , because even if dissociation of RNA duplexes can be achieved , RNA replication 499 must outpace duplex reannealing , which is rapid unless duplex concentrations are low or 500 reactions take place in a highly viscuous medium ( He et al . , 2017 ; Tupper and Higgs , 2021 ) . 501 In this context , we reasoned that RCS might provide favourable properties : synthesis and 502 strand displacement on a circular template can proceed essentially iso - energetically as base - 503 pairing ( H - bonding / stacking ) interactions broken in the product strand during strand 504 displacement are continuously compensated for by new base - pairing interactions formed in 505 the nascent strand . In turn , this could lead to an open - end formation of template coupled 506 stochiometric excess of single stranded RNA product strand to encode functions to further aid 507 replication as we show here with resection and recircularisation by an encoded ribozyme . 508 In the course of this work , we discovered another mechanism that might contribute to 509 overcoming the strand inhibition problem . MD simulations indicate that - at least - on small 510 RNA circles – the build - up of strain in the nascent dsRNA could aid strand displacement 511 ( Figure 3 ) . However , the MD simulations also suggest that strain is non - directional destabilizes 512 both nascent strand 5’ - as well as 3’ - end likely inhibiting extension and promoting non - 513 templated triplet addition . Thus , the potential advantages of scRNA RCS seems to be 514 tempered by opposing effects such as strain as well as reduced template accessibility due to 515 circular RNA ring geometry ( Figure 1 ) . Nevertheless , we find that a viroid - like replication 516 strategy can be accomplished by RNA catalysis alone , with one ribozyme performing RCS on 517 circular RNA templates yielding concatemeric RNA products , which can be processed ( i . e . 518 resected ) and recircularized by a second ribozyme . Future improvements in polymerase 519 ribozyme activity and processivity may allow all necessary components of such a replication 520 cycle to be encoded on a circular RNA “genome” and propagated by self - replication and - 521 processing reactions . 522 Materials and methods 523 Oligonucleotides 524 Base sequences of all oligonucleotides used throughout this work can be found in 525 Supplementary file 1 . 526 527 In vitro transcription 528 Page 22 of 39 dsDNA templates ( containing T7 promotor sequence at the 5’ end upstream of the region to 529 transcribe ) for in vitro transcription was generated by “fill - in” using three cycles of mutual 530 extension using GoTaq HotStart , ( Promega , Madison , Wisconsin ) between the relevant 531 oligonucleotide and primers : 5T7 or HDVrt ( the latter for defined 3’ terminus formation 532 ( Schürer et al . , 2002 ) ) 533 The T7 transcription protocol used is based on Megascript . Briefly explained , transcriptions of 534 RNA requiring a triphosphate at the 5’ - end ( termed GTP Transcription ) reaction were carried 535 out under the following conditions : 40 mM Tris - Cl pH 8 , 10 mM DTT , 2 mM spermidine , 20 536 mM MgCl2 , 7 . 5 mM each NTP ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , dsDNA templates ( varying amount , 537 preferably > 5 μM ) , 0 . 01 units / μL of inorganic pyrophosphatase ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , 538 Waltham , Massachusetts ) , ~ 50 μg / μ L of T7 RNA polymerase ( home made by Isaac Gallego ) . 539 Reactions were left overnight ( ~ 16 hours ) at 37°C . Then 0 . 5x volume EDTA ( 0 . 5 M ) was added 540 together with ( at least ) 2 . 5x volume of loading buffer ( final conditions > 50 % formamide or > 8M 541 Urea and 5 mM EDTA ) . For transcription of RNA with a monophosphate 5’ - end ( termed GMP 542 Transcription ) the same procedure is followed as for NTP Transcription , however 10 mM GMP 543 and 2 . 5 mM of each NTP instead of the higher amount of NTP used for GTP transcription . 544 545 Gel electroporation for analysis or purification 546 The sample in appropriate loading buffer were separated on 10 - 20 % 8 M Urea denaturing 547 PAGE gel using an EV400 DNA Sequencing Unit ( Cambridge Electrophoresis ) . The product 548 band was visualised by UV shadowing ( for non - labelled RNA ) or florescence scanning 549 ( Typhoon scanner , Amersham Typhoon ) ( for labelled RNA ) . When needed the identified 550 product based on relative migration was excised . The excised gel fragment was then 551 thoroughly crushed using a pipette tip and suspended in 10 mM Tris - Cl pH 7 . 4 to form a slurry . 552 For freeze and squeeze extraction , the slurry was frozen in dry ice , then heated to 50°C ( ~ 5 553 min ) and finally left rotating at room temperature ( from 2 hours to overnight ) to elute the 554 product from the gel material . The eluate was then filtered using a Spin - X column ( 0 . 22 μm 555 pore size , Costar ) , ethanol precipitated , ( 100 mM Acidic acid and 80 % ethanol ( 10 ug glycogen 556 carrier was present when noted ) ) . UV absorbance was measured with a Nanodrop ND - 1000 557 spectrophotometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) to determine yield of redissolved purified RNA . 558 559 Calculation of extension efficiency 560 Gel Images from the Typhoon scanner where analysed in ImageQuant software ( Cytiva life 561 science ) for quantifying band - intensity . Quantified band intensities were exported to Excel 562 ( Microsoft , Redmond , Washington ) for further analysis . Extension efficiency ( E ) for a given 563 band ( b ) was calculated as the sum of the intensities ( I ) of all the bands from b to n , ( n being 564 the highest detectable band ) , divided by the sum of I of all bands from b - 1 to n : 565 Page 23 of 39 𝐸𝐸 𝑏𝑏 = ∑ 𝐼𝐼 𝑏𝑏 𝑛𝑛𝑏𝑏 ∑ 𝐼𝐼 𝑏𝑏−1 𝑛𝑛𝑏𝑏 � ( 1 ) 566 Thus , E represents the efficiency of the given ligation junction ( Lb ) to allow production of the 567 extension product in band b , i . e . the extension efficiency . 568 569 Triplet transcription 570 Triplets were prepared via run - off in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase . More details 571 on the method can be found in ( Attwater et al . , 2018 ) . Reaction conditions were as follows : 572 100 pmols of DNA template for each triplet was mixed with equimolar DNA oligo 5T7 to form 573 the template for transcription . For triplets starting with purines , the NTP transcription protocol 574 was used as described above with a total NTP concentration of 30 mM but only adding the 575 nucleotides necessary for the triplet ( e . g . AUA was transcribed with only ATP and UTP ) . For 576 triplets starting in pyrimidines a lower total NTP concentration was used ( 4 . 32 mM ) as this 577 yielded better defined bands for purification . 50 μL transcription reactions were stopped with 578 2 μL EDTA ( 0 . 5M ) and 5 μL of 100 % glycerol was added to facilitate gel loading . The samples 579 were separated by 30 % 3 M Urea denaturing PAGE as described above . Correct sequence 580 composition was confirmed by A260 / 280 absorbance ratio , measured with the Nanodrop . 581 582 Circularization of RNA 583 Linear 5’ - end monophosphate labelled RNA to be used for circularization was either prepared 584 by in vitro transcription ( 300 μL reaction volume ) or ordered directly as chemically synthesized 585 RNA ( Integrated DNA Technologies ( IDT ) , Iowa , United Stated ) . Linear RNA was gel purified 586 as described above . When needed purified RNA was treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase 587 ( PNK ) ( New England Biolabs ( NEB ) , Ipswich , Massachusetts ) to remove 3’ - end cyclic 588 phosphate then RNA was phenol / chloroform extracted , ethanol precipitated and redissolved 589 in ddH2O . For splinted ligation , 3 pmol purified RNA was mixed with equimolar splint RNA in 590 262 . 5 μL ddH2O . The sample was heated to 80°C ( 2 min . ) followed by cooling to 17°C ( 10 591 min . ) and finally incubated on ice ( 5 - 30 min . ) . Then reaction conditions were adjusted to 50 592 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 2 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM DTT , 400 μM ATP ( 1x T4 RNA ligase 2 reaction 593 buffer ( NEB ) ) including 0 . 25 units / μL T4 RNA ligase 2 ( Neb ) ( final volume 300 μL ) and 594 samples left over night ( ~ 16 hours ) at 4°C . For non - splinted ligation , 10 pmol gel purified RNA 595 was mixed in 237 μL ddH2O followed by heating to 95°C and then quickly moved to ice . Then 596 reaction conditions were adjusted to 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM DTT ( 1x 597 T4 RNA ligase reaction buffer ( Neb ) ) , 100 μM ATP including 1 unit / μL T4 RNA ligase 1 ( NEB ) 598 ( final volume 300 μL ) and samples left over night ( ~ 16 hours ) at 16°C . Circularized RNA was 599 electrophorated by 10 % 8M Urea denaturing PAGE for analysis and purification as described 600 above . 601 Page 24 of 39 602 Templated RNA - catalysed RNA synthesis ( the primer extension assay ) 603 Ribozyme activity assay was performed essentially as described in ( Attwater et al . , 2018 ) . In 604 a standard reaction ( modified where specified ) , ribozyme heterodimer ( 5TU / t1 ) , template , 605 primer ( 5 pmol of each ) and triplets ( 50 pmol of each ) were annealed in 7 . 5 μL water ( 80 °C 2 606 min , 17 °C 10 min ) . Then 2 . 5 μL 4x reaction buffer was added ( final volume 10 μL ) and 607 samples were left on ice for ~ 5 min to ensure folding . Final pre - frozen conditions were ( unless 608 otherwise noted ) either ( Tris buffer system ) 50 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 3 at 25 °C ) , 100 mM MgCl2 and 609 0 . 01 % Tween20 , or ( CHES buffer system ) 50 mM CHES ( pH 9 at 25 °C ) , 150 mM KCl , 10 610 mM MgCl2 and 0 . 01 % Tween20 . At this point some samples ( noted in the text ) were diluted 611 by adding ddH2O ( e . g . 50x dilution corresponds to adding 490 μL ddH2O to the 10 μL 612 samples ) . Finally , samples were frozen on dry ice and incubated at - 7 °C in a R4 series TC120 613 refrigerated cooling bath ( Grant , Shepreth , UK ) to allow eutectic phase formation and reaction , 614 respectively . 615 To end the incubations , samples that had been diluted were thawed , moved to 2mL tubes , 616 ethanol precipitated ( with glycogen carrier ) and redissovled in 10 μL ddH2O . This step was 617 avoided for undiluted samples that were already 10 μL . Finally , 0 . 5 μL EDTA ( 0 . 5M ) was 618 added to all samples to a final volume of 15 μL . ( In experiments where the effect of dilution 619 was investigated , e . g . as experiment presented in Supporting Figure 5 , ddH2O was added to 620 all the thawed samples to reach the same volume before precipitation ) . 621 To prepare for separation of extension products , 3 μL of the reacted samples after addition of 622 EDTA ( corresponding to 1 pmol template RNA ) was diluted to reach the final loading 623 conditions : 166 mM EDTA , 6M Urea ( + Bromophenol blue ) and 10 - 20 pmol competing RNA 624 ( to prevent long product / template reannealing ) ( final volume 10 μL ) . Finally , samples were 625 denatured ( 95°C for 5 min ) and RNA separated by 8M Urea denaturing PAGE . 626 627 Sequencing of extension products 628 In the primer extension reactions used for sequencing , the primer extension was performed 629 as described above except for the following changes : 5 pmol ribozyme heterodimer / template , 630 20 pmol primer ( with a 5’adapter sequence ) and 100 pmol of each triplet was used . In the 631 cases where multiple templates were mixed in the same reaction ( one - pot ) , the final template 632 concentration remained 5 pmol in total . All reactions were done in the CHES buffer and were 633 diluted 50x as standard . 634 635 Adapter ligation and RT - PCR : After Urea PAGE separation of the extension products , the 636 noted region of the gel was dissected out , and carefully recovered as described above . The 637 RNA was ethanol precipitated ( 80 % ethanol with 10 ug glycogen carrier ) resulting in a dry 638 Page 25 of 39 RNA pellet . To append an adaptor sequence to the 3’ - end of the purified RNA products the 639 dry RNA was redissolved in conditions allowing adenylated adapter ligation by T4 RNA Ligase 640 2 truncated K227Q ( Neb ) following manufacturers descriptions . Final adapter ligation 641 conditions were : 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM DTT ( 1x T4 RNA ligase 642 reaction buffer ( NEB ) ) , 15 % PEG8000 , 0 . 04 % Tween 20 , 5 pmol adenylated DNA primer 643 ( Adap1 , for base sequences see Supplementary file 1 ) and 20 U / µL T4 RNA Ligase 2 644 truncated K227Q ( Neb ) ( final volume 10 µL ) . The samples were then ligated at 16°C for two 645 hours . Pre - adenylation of Adap1 using Mth RNA Ligase ( Neb ) was performed following 646 manufacturers descriptions . After adapter ligation , samples were diluted 10 - fold to achieve 647 conditions for performing RT - PCR ( 25 cycles ) using 0 . 5 µM forward ( PCRp3 ) and reverse 648 primer ( RTp1 ) and the SuperScript III One - Step RT - PCR system with Platinum Taq DNA 649 polymerase ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Finally , RT - PCR products were gel purified in 3 % 650 agarose gel and cleaned up using QIAGen gel extraction kit ( QiaGen , Hilden , Germany ) . 651 652 Sanger sequencing : Purified RT - PCR products were cloned in to pGEM vector using pGEM - 653 T easy vector Systems ( Promega ) as described by manufacturer and transformed into heat - 654 competent 10 - Beta cells ( NEB ) . Inserts from single colonies were PCR amplified ( using 655 primers pGEM _ T7 _ Fo , pGEM _ SP6 _ Ba ) and send in for Sanger sequencing ( Source 656 bioscience ) ( using pGEM _ T7 _ Fo as sequencing primer ) . Illumina sequencing : Illumina 657 adaptors were added to purified RT - PCR products by PCR ( 15 cycles ) using 0 . 5 µM forward 658 ( Ill x _ Fo , x denotes different barcodes 1 - 15 , see oligo sequences in supplementary material ) 659 and reverse primers ( Ill _ Ba ) and Q5 Hot - Start High - Fidelity 2X Master Mix ( Neb ) . PCR 660 products were gel purified in 3 % agarose gel and qPCRed ( using NEBNext Library Quant Kit 661 for Illumina ) to quantify concentration . Finally , the DNA ( consisting of Illumina adapters , 662 barcodes and RT - PCRed sequence from the RNA extension ) were prepared following 663 manufactures protocol for MiSeq Illumina sequencing ( Illumina , San Diego , California ) ( see 664 e . g . MiSeq System Guide ) . 665 666 Sequencing data analysis 667 Illumina Sequencing data were acquired and processed as FASTQ files using Terminal ( and 668 available software packages such as FASTX - toolkit ) . Prior to analysis the whole output file 669 form illumina sequencing runs ( containing also unrelated sequences ) was split based on 670 barcodes identifying the individual samples and trimmed starting with the original ( P9 1 ) primer 671 sequence ( GAAGAACTG ) . After the P9 1 sequence , the triplets at positions 1 , 2 , 3 etc . would 672 be identifiable representing extension products made by the ribozyme . The presence for the 673 3’ adapter sequence ( GTCGAATAT… ) in the aligned sequences marked the end of the 674 original RNA extension product . Sequencing data can be found as described belos under 675 Page 26 of 39 section data availability : File 1 include sequence data for circular and linear one - pot analysis 676 ( C1 and L1 , respectively ) , File 2 include sequence data for branched RCS analysis ( B3 ) ) . 677 Analysis of the one - pot experiments : By counting the number of times a given triplet was 678 present at a given position , we were able to calculate the fidelity for each triplet at this position . 679 Identifying and counting the sequencing reads ( n ) for each position was done using grep ( in 680 Terminal ) with a list of all relevant sequences ( positions 3 to 18 ) and the sequencing files . The 681 triplet at position 3 , the first barcode position , was used to classify the sequences into coming 682 from template A to D and thus has 100 % fidelity for the correct triplet ( Figure 4B ) . 683 684 In example , for analysing the fidelity ( F ) of position 4 , the following list was used : 685 GAAGAACTG ( primer ) GAA ( pos1 ) GAA ( pos2 ) YYY ( pos3 ) XXX ( pos4 ) . Here YYY was either of the first 686 barcode triplets for templates A - D , ( ATA ( template A ) , AAA ( template B ) , TTA ( template C ) or ATC ( template D ) ) 687 and XXX was either of the 14 possible triplets ( CTG , ATA , CCA , CCC , AAA , CAC , GGG , TTA , 688 TCC , GGC , ATC , GAT , CGC , GAA ) . F at position 4 was then calculated for template A - D as 689 the number of occurrences of a triplet in positon 4 ( e . g . CCA ) divided by the sum of 690 occurrences of all the triplets multiplied by 100 % . A generalized term for calculating the F at 691 all positions ( 3 - 18 ) and for all templates ( A - D ) is : 692 𝐹𝐹 ( 𝑎𝑎 , 𝑌𝑌 ) = 𝑛𝑛 ( 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 , 𝑎𝑎 , 𝑌𝑌 ) 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆�𝑛𝑛 ( 𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋 , 𝑎𝑎 , 𝑌𝑌 ) � � × 100 % ( 2 ) 693 Here F is the fidelity , a is the position of the triplet , Y is the template A - D . n is the number of 694 sequencing reads for a given triplet ( xxx ) for position a on template Y or for all the 14 triplets 695 ( XXX ) , for a on Y . Eventually , the fidelity for positions 3 - 15 in the context of template A - D for 696 all triplets was plotted in Figure 4B . Accumulated chance for a product of reaching positions 697 X ( shown in plot in Figure 4C ) was calculated by multiplying all fidelities for moving from 698 position 3 to position X with correct triplets ( fidelities found in Figure 4C ) . Data for this analysis 699 can be found as described in data availability section below ( File 1 ) . Numerical data and 700 calculation is supplied in Figure 4 - source data 1 . 701 Analysis of the branched RCS : By counting the number ( n ) of correct sequences with a specific 702 length ending in the 3’adapter sequence , we identified long RCS products ( Figure 5D ) . This 703 was done using grep ( in Terminal ) with a list of all relevant sequences ( positions 9 to 30 , both 704 product I and II ) , and the sequencing file . Data for this analysis can be found as described in 705 data availability section below ( File 2 ) Numerical data and calculation is supplied in Figure 5 - 706 source data 1 . 707 708 Self - circularizing Micro Hammerhead ribozyme assay 709 RNA catalysed synthesis of fluorophore labelled self - circularizing micro Hammerhead 710 ribozyme was prepared in 2x large ( 500 pmol ) reactions set up and incubated as described 711 Page 27 of 39 above . Specifically , 500pmol ribozyme heterodimer ( 5TU / t1 ) and circular template 712 ( HHrzCtemp alt7 ) , 2000 pmol primer ( HHrzP12 ) and 50 µmol of each of the triplets were 713 annealed followed by adding buffer to 50 mM CHES , pH 9 ; 150 mM KCl ; 10 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 05 % 714 Tween 20 ( 1mL ) . Then the sample was diluted 50 times to a final volume of 50 mL . After 4 715 weeks incubation at - 7 °C , EDTA was added ( 5mM final concentration ) , reactions were thawed 716 and concentrated to a final volume of ~ 300 µL using a centrifugation filter ( Amicon Ultra , 3 717 kDa cut off ) retaining long RNA products . Micro Hammerhead ribozyme RNA ( marked in 718 Figure 6C ) was purified by gel electrophoresis and excised product was dissolved to 10 µM in 719 H2O with 0 . 5 mM EDTA . 720 721 Chemically synthesized fluorophore labelled self - circularizing micro Hammerhead ribozyme 722 RNA ( IDT ) was gel purified as described above and excised product was dissolved to 10 µM 723 in H2O with 0 . 5mM EDTA . 724 725 micro Hammerhead ribozyme cleavage / circularization assay 726 Micro hammerhead self - circularization assays comprise 10 pmol micro HHrz annealed ( 80 °C 727 2 min , 17 °C 10 min ) in 4 µL water with 1 µL 5x reaction buffer , final reaction conditions : 50 728 mM CHES , pH 9 ; 150 mM KCl ; 10 mM MgCl2 ( same as for the Templated RNA - catalysed 729 RNA synthesis ) . Then incubated in ice for 5 min to ensure folding . This was then frozen on 730 dry ice and either moved to - 7 °C for eutectic phase formation ( reaction ) or - 80 °C ( control ) . 731 After incubation , 10 µL loading buffer ( 95 % Formamide , 25 mM EDTA , Bromophenol blue ) 732 was added directly to the cold samples to stop the reaction and mixed while thawing . Finally , 733 reactions were analysed by 20 % denaturing PAGE like described above . 734 735 5’ phosphorylation of micro HHrz RNA with polynucleotide kinase ( NEB ) as done following 736 manufacturer’s directions . RNA was then phenol / chloroform washed , precipitate and 737 dissolved in ddH2O with 0 . 5mM EDTA to 10 µM ( determined by Nanodrop ) . 738 739 Molecular Dynamics simulations . 740 All simulations were set up with the AMBER 18 suite of programs and performed using the 741 CUDA implementation of AMBER’s pmemd program ( Case , n . d . ) . A linear ssRNA of 36 nt with 742 the sequence ( UUC ) 12 was built using the NAB utility , which was then circularised using an in - 743 house programme ( Pyne et al . , 2021 ) . From there , the complementary strand containing GAA 744 triplets was progressively grown representing the different stages of the rolling circle 745 replication , containing 9 , 18 , 21 , 24 , 27 till 30 nt of dsRNA keeping the rest single - stranded . 746 For each stage , a representative structure was used as a scaffold to grow the dsRNA part and 747 thus build the structure to model next stage . A linear dsRNA fragment containing 4 GAA triplets 748 Page 28 of 39 with a nick between the first and second was run as a control . This molecule had a total length 749 of 16 bp as it was capped by a CG dimer on each end . 750 The AMBER99 forcefield ( Cheatham et al . , 1999 ) with different corrections for backbone 751 dihedral angles including the parmBSC0 for α and γ ( Pérez et al . , 2007 ) and the parmOL3 for 752 χ ( glycosidic bond ) ( Zgarbová et al . , 2011 ) were used to describe the RNA . All initial structures 753 were explicitly solvated using a truncated octahedral TIP3P box with a 14 Å buffer . They were 754 neutralized by two different types of salt , KCl and MgCl 2 , described by the ‘scaled charged’ 755 Empirical Continuum Correction ( ECC ) set of ion parameters ( Duboué - Dijon et al . , 2018 ) , and 756 with the necessary ion pairs ( Machado and Pantano , 2020 ) for matching 0 . 2 M in the case of 757 KCl , and 0 . 1 and 0 . 5 M in the case of MgCl 2 . Simulations were performed at constant T and 758 P ( 300 K and 1 atm ) following standard protocols ( Noy and Golestanian , 2010 ) for 400 ns . 759 The last 100 ns sampled every 10 ps were used for the subsequent analysis . AMBER program 760 CPPTRAJ ( Roe and Cheatham , 2013 ) was used to determine base - pair step parameters , 761 radial distribution functions of ions around RNA and distances between atoms , including 762 groove width and hydrogen bonds . The latter were defined with a distance cutoff of 3 . 5 Å and 763 an angle cutoff of 120° . Counterion - density maps were obtained using Canion ( Lavery et al . , 764 2014 ) and were subsequently visualized with Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) . SerraNA 765 software was used to calculate curvatures at different sub - fragment lengths ( Velasco - 766 Berrelleza et al . , 2020 ) . 767 768 Page 29 of 39 Acknowledgements : 769 This work was supported by the Carlsberg Foundation ( ELK ) , by the Medical Research 770 Council ( MRC ) program grant program no .

Purification of circularized RNA . Identification and dissection 802 of circularized RNA were performed by denaturing PAGE . Representative SyBr Gold stained 803 10 % Urea PAGE gel is shown here for illustrating the circularization process of circular RNA 804 Page 30 of 39 templates used in main text Figure 2B . In the gel , RNA before ( odd lanes ) and after ( even 805 lanes ) ligation with T4RNA ligase 2 was analysed . A 10 nucleotide ( nt ) RNA splint ( covering 806 5 nt of the 5’ - end and 3’ - end of the linear RNA strand ) was used for circularization as required 807 by T4 RNA ligase 2 . In the ligated samples , multiple bands ( A - D ) appeared representing 808 various combinations of ligated RNA strands . By migration analysis ( right panel ) , we identified 809 A and C as linear constructs and B and D as circularized constructs ( illustrations of the 810 identified structure of A - D can be seen to the right of the gel ) . Monomeric circularized RNA 811 ( corresponding to band B ) was dissected out and used throughout this work . Bands A - D 812 discussed here should not be confused with templates A - D used in main text figure 4 .

A ) Comparison 816 between linear and circular primer extension using the CHES reaction buffer system ( similar 817 to main text Figure 1D that is in the Tris buffer system ) . Extensions performed at - 7 o C for 2 818 weeks . B ) The periodic oscillations were observed with various repeat sequence templates 819 ( CGG , GAC and GAA ) in both CHES and Tris buffer systems . Extensions performed at - 7 o C 820 for 4 weeks . C ) Dilution of samples increased the efficiency . The plot in C ) shows the 821 difference in extension efficiency ( Δ - extension efficiency ) between the undiluted ( Un . ) and the 822 2 - 50 fold diluted ( x2 - x50 ) samples . The Δ - extension efficient of the ligations before invasion 823 ( mean of bands 1 - 9 ) were unaffected by the dilution ( giving a Δ - extension efficient of ~ 1 ) . 824 However , the Δ - extension efficiency of band 10 ( full length + 1 triplet , invasion ) increased 825 strongly with dilution . Extensions performed at - 7 o C for 1 week . D ) The same effect of dilution 826 ( improving invasion ) was seen over a range of MgCl2 concentrations ( 50 - 200 mM ) . 827 Extensions performed at - 7 o C for 1 weeks . All extension reactions presented here were run 828 at standard reaction conditions described in main text Materials and Methods except when 829 specified otherwise for dilution , salt or buffer system .

Counterion - density maps around RNA molecules that show 846 an occupancy ~ 10 times or greater the bulk concentration ( in red ) as seen in simulations . 847 These areas are the molecular regions where cations localize preferentially . In the case of 200 848 mM KCl , these align along the grooves , whereas , in the case of MgCl 2 , they tend to be closer 849 to the backbone and bridge distant backbone points , making the bases more exposed . 850 Extremely high Mg 2 + concentrations provide similar interacting profiles to moderate levels 851 indicating saturation on the preferred binding sites in both cases . 852 853 Figure 3 - Figure supplement 4 . Averages and standard deviations ( as error bars ) of radial 854 distribution functions ( rdf ) of cations around RNA backbone phosphates . The rdf indicate the 855 probability of finding an ion within a certain distance of a particular RNA atom in relation to its 856 bulk concentration ( set at 1 ) . Magnesium ions make more direct interactions with RNA 857 backbone ( first peak ) and mediated by water molecules ( subsequent peaks ) than potassium . 858 The smaller rdf peaks observed on 500 mM compared to 100 mM indicate a relatively lower 859 ion condensation around RNA with respect to bulk concentration due to saturation . 860 861 Figure 4 - Figure supplement 1 .
