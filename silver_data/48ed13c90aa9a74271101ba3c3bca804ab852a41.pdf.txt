It commonly affects the deep leg veins ( such as the calf veins , femoral vein , or popliteal vein ) or the deep veins of the pelvis . It is a potentially dangerous condition that can lead to preventable morbidity and mortality . Aim : To present an update on the causes and management of DVT . Methods : A review of publications obtained from Medline search , medical libraries , and Google . Results : DVT affects 0 . 1 % of persons per year . It is predominantly a disease of the elderly and has a slight male preponderance . The approach to making a diagnosis currently involves an algo - rithm combining pretest probability , D - dimer testing , and compression ultrasonography . This will guide further investigations if necessary . Prophylaxis is both mechanical and pharmacological . The goals of treatment are to prevent extension of thrombi , pulmonary embolism , recurrence of thrombi , and the development of complications such as pulmonary hypertension and post - thrombotic syndrome . Conclusion : DVT is a potentially dangerous condition with a myriad of risk factors . Prophylaxis is very important and can be mechanical and pharmacological . The mainstay of treatment is anticoagulant therapy . Low - molecular - weight heparin , unfractionated heparin , and vitamin K antagonists have been the treatment of choice . Currently anticoagulants specifically targeting components of the common pathway have been recommended for prophylaxis . These include fondaparinux , a selective indirect factor Xa inhibitor and the new oral selective direct thrombin inhibitors ( dabigatran ) and selective factor Xa inhibitors ( rivaroxaban and apixaban ) . Others are currently undergoing trials . Thrombolytics and vena caval filters are very rarely indicated in special circumstances . Keywords : deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , venous thromboembolism , prophylaxis , treatment Introduction The term thrombosis refers to the formation , from constituents of blood , of an abnormal mass within the vascular system of a living animal . When this process occurs within the deep veins , it is referred to as deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) . An accurate diagnosis of DVT is extremely important to prevent potentially fatal acute complication of pulmonary embolism ( PE ) and long - term complications of postphlebitis syndrome and pulmonary hypertension . It is also important to avoid unjustified therapy with anticoagulants with associated high risk of bleeding in patients misdiagnosed with the condition . 1 J ou r na l o f B l ood M ed i c i ne do w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / www . do v ep r e ss . c o m / b y 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 on 11 - J an - 2019 F o r pe r s ona l u s e on l y .

We aim to critically review the current state of knowledge on this subject , with a view to updating clinicians on the prophylaxis and treatment of DVT . Methods A literature review of DVT was done from 1970 to date using a manual library search , journal publications on the subject , and Medline . Full texts of the materials , including those of relevant references were collected and studied . Information relating to the epidemiology , pathology , clinical presentation , investigations , prophylaxis , treatment , and complications was extracted from the materials . Results epidemiology DVT is a major and a common preventable cause of death worldwide . It affects approximately 0 . 1 % of persons per year . The overall average age - and sex - adjusted annual incidence of venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) is 117 per 100 , 000 ( DVT , 48 per 100 , 000 ; PE , 69 per 100 , 000 ) , with higher age - adjusted rates among males than females ( 130 vs 110 per 100 , 000 , respectively ) . 2 Both sexes are equally afflicted by a first VTE , men having a higher risk of recurrent thrombosis . 3 , 4 DVT is predominantly a disease of the elderly with an incidence that rises markedly with age . 2 A study by Keenan and White revealed that African - American patients are the highest risk group for first - time VTE . Hispanic patients’ risk is about half that of Caucasians . The risk of recurrence in Caucasians is lower than that of African - Americans and Hispanics . 5 The incidence of VTE is low in children . Annual inci - dences of 0 . 07 to 0 . 14 per 10 , 000 children and 5 . 3 per 10 , 000 hospital admissions have been reported in Cauca - sian studies . 6 , 7 This low incidence may be due to decreased capacity to generate thrombin , increased capacity of alpha - 2 - macroglobulin to inhibit thrombin , and enhanced antithrombin potential of vessel walls . The highest incidence in childhood is during the neonatal period , followed by another peak in adolescence . 8 The incidence rate is compara - tively higher in adolescent females because of pregnancy and use of oral contraceptive agents . 9 Pregnant women have a much higher risk of VTE than nonpregnant women of similar age and the risk has been shown to be higher after cesarian section than after vaginal delivery . 10 In a study conducted in an African population , the documented rate was 48 DVT per 100 , 000 births per year . 11 The incidence appears to be highest in the postpartum period . 11 , 12 The approximate risk for DVT following general surgery procedures is 15 % to 40 % . It nearly doubles after hip or knee replacement surgery or hip fracture surgery ( 40 % to 60 % ) . 13 Geerts et al revealed that without prophylaxis , fatal PE occurs in 0 . 2 % to 0 . 9 % of patients undergoing elective general surgery , 0 . 1 % to 2 % of those undergoing elective hip replacement and up to 2 . 5 % to 7 . 5 % of those undergoing surgery for hip fracture . 14 Though regarded mainly as a surgi - cal complication , most symptomatic VTE events and fatal PE occur in medical patients . 15 Pathogenesis / classification Thrombus formation preferentially starts in the valve pockets of the veins of the calf and extends proximally . This is espe - cially true for those that occur following surgery . 16 Though most thrombi begin intraoperatively , some start a few days , weeks , or months after surgery . Lending its support to the origin of thrombus in valve pockets is a recent hypothesis of an increased expression of endothelial protein C receptor ( EPCR ) and thrombomodulin ( TM ) and a decreased expres - sion of Von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) noted in valve sinus endothelium compared with vein luminal endothelium . This means an upregulation of anticoagulants ( EPCR , TM ) and a downregulation of procoagulant ( vWF ) properties of the valvular sinus endothelium . 17 Thrombus is composed predominantly of fibrin and red cells ( red or static thrombus ) . Venous thrombus must be differentiated from postmortem clot at autopsy . Postmortem clots are gelatinous and have a dark red dependent portion ( formed by red cells that have settled by gravity and a yellow chicken fat supernatant resembling melted and clotted chicken fat ) . They are usually not attached to the underly - ing wall . This is in contrast to the venous thrombi which are firmer . They almost always have a point of attachment to the wall and transection reveals vague strands of pale gray fibrin . 18 DVT in the lower limb can be classified as a ) proximal , when the popliteal vein or thigh veins are involved or b ) distal , when the calf veins are involved . Clinically , proximal vein thrombosis is of greater importance and is associated with serious chronic diseases such as active cancer , conges - tive cardiac failure , respiratory insufficiency , or age above 75 years , whereas distal thrombosis is more often associated with risk factors such as recent surgery and immobilization . Fatal PE is far more likely to result from proximal DVT . 19 Post - thrombotic syndrome , a chronic , potentially disabling J ou r na l o f B l ood M ed i c i ne do w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / www . do v ep r e ss . c o m / b y 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 on 11 - J an - 2019 F o r pe r s ona l u s e on l y .

These include phlegmasia alba dolens , phlegmasia cerulea dolens , and venous gangrene . In phlegmasia alba dolens , the thrombosis involves only the major deep venous channels of the extremity , sparing collateral veins . However , in phlegmasia cerulea dolens , the thrombosis extends to the collateral vein , resulting in massive fluid sequestration and more significant edema . Clinical features History and clinical examination are not reliable ways of diagnosing DVT . 21 Lower extremity DVT can be symptomatic or asymptomatic . Patients with lower extremity DVT often do not present with erythema , pain , warmth , swelling , or tenderness . Symptomatic patients with proximal DVT may present with lower extremity pain , calf tenderness , and lower extremity swelling . 22 , 23 Homans’ sign may be demonstrable in DVT . Most of these features lack specificity ; hence clinical evaluation usually implies the need for further evaluation . The left leg is the commonest site for venous thrombosis in pregnancy 11 and in acute massive venous thrombosis . This may be due to compression of the left iliac vein by the right iliac artery ( May – Thurner syndrome ) . 24 Phlegmasia alba dolens is characterized by edema , pain , and blanching without cyanosis while phlegmasia cerulea dolens is characterized by these features in addition to cyanosis , which characteristically progresses from distal to proximal areas and bleb / bulla formation . Risk factors Rudolph Virchow described three conditions that predispose to thrombus , the so - called Virchow’s triad . This triad includes endothelial injury , stasis or turbulence of blood flow , and blood hypercoagulability . Stasis and endothelial injury are important in DVT following trauma or surgery while hypercoagulability is responsible for most cases of spontaneous DVT . At least 96 % of patients treated for VTE have been shown to have at least one risk factor . 25 Risk can be classified as acquired or genetic . When genetic defects are combined with one or more acquired risk factors , or in combined genetic defects or combination of two acquired defects , it results in a risk of VTE that exceeds the separate effects of a single factor . 26 In adults , the clinical conditions that predispose to VTE are increasing age , cancer and its treatment , prolonged immobility , stroke or paralysis , previous VTE , congestive heart failure , acute infection , pregnancy or puerperium , dehydration , hormonal treatment , varicose veins , long air travel , acute inflammatory bowel disease , rheumatological disease , and nephrotic syndrome . Other acquired factors that have recently been associated with increased risk of VTE disorders include persistent elevation of D - dimer and atherosclerotic disease . 27 Oral contraceptive pills , especially those that contain third - generation progestins increase the risk of VTE . 28 Risk of DVT associated with long - duration air travel is called economy class syndrome . 29 It is 3 % to 12 % in a long - haul flight with stasis , hypoxia , and dehydration being pathophysi - ological changes that increase the risk . 30 van Aken et al dem - onstrated that subjects with elevated levels of interleukin - 8 have increased risk of venous thrombosis , supporting an important role of inflammation in etiopathogenesis of venous thrombosis . 31 Clayton et al have described a strong association between recent respiratory infection and VTE . They demonstrated an increased risk of DVT in the month following infection and PE in 3 months following infection , both persisting up to a year . 32 In the pediatric age group , the most important triggering risk factors for development of thromboembolism are the presence of central venous lines , cancer , and chemotherapy . Severe infection , sickle cell disease , trauma , and antiphos - pholipid syndromes are clinical conditions associated with hypercoagulability states . 33 Genetic risk factors can be divided into strong , moderate , and weak factors . 34 Strong factors are deficiencies of anti - thrombin , protein C and protein S . Moderately strong factors include factor V Leiden , prothrombin 20210A , non - O blood group , and fibrinogen 10034T . Weak genetic risk factors include fibrinogen , factor XIII and factor XI variants . Clinical prediction rules A commonly accepted evidence - based approach to diagno - sis of VTE is the use of a clinical model that standardizes the clinical assessment ( combining risk factors , signs and symptoms ) and subsequently stratifies patients suspected of DVT . Though this model has been used for both primary care patients and secondary settings , there is no doubt that it does not guarantee accurate estimation of risk in primary care patients in whom DVT is suspected . 35 J ou r na l o f B l ood M ed i c i ne do w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / www . do v ep r e ss . c o m / b y 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 on 11 - J an - 2019 F o r pe r s ona l u s e on l y .

Based on clinical pre - sentation and risk factors , an initial model was developed to group patients into low - , moderate - , and high - probability groups . The high - probability group has an 85 % risk of DVT , the moderate - probability group a 33 % risk , and the low - probability group a 5 % risk . 36 However , in a later study , Wells and colleagues further streamlined the diagnostic pro - cess by stratifying patients into two risk categories : “DVT unlikely” if the clinical score is # 1 and “DVT likely” if the clinical score is . 1 ( Table 1 ) . 37 D - dimer assay D - dimer is a degradation product of cross - linked fibrin that is formed immediately after thrombin - generated fibrin clots are degraded by plasmin . It reflects a global activation of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis . 38 It is the best recognized biomarker for the initial assessment of suspected VTE . The combination of clinical risk stratification and a D - dimer test can exclude VTE in more than 25 % of patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of VTE without the need for additional investigations . 39 Even in patients with clinically suspected recurrent DVT , this combination ( clinical evalu - ation and D - dimer ) has proved to be useful for excluding DVT , especially in patients included in the lower clinical pretest probability group . 40 Levels of D - dimer can be popularly measured using three types of assay : • Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . • Latex agglutination assay . • Red blood cell whole blood agglutination assay ( simpliRED ) . These assays differ in sensitivity , specificity , likelihood ratio , and variability among patients with suspected VTE . ELISAs dominate the comparative ranking among D - dimer assays for sensitivity and negative likelihood ratio . D - dimer assays are highly sensitive ( values up to 95 % ) , but have poor specificity to prove VTE . The negative predic - tive value for patients with a negative D - dimer blood test is nearly 100 % . Hence a negative value of D - dimer may safely rule out both DVT and PE . False positive D - dimer results have been noted in inflammation , 41 pregnancy , 42 malignancy , 43 and the elderly . 44 Clinical usefulness of the measurement of D - dimer has been shown to decrease with age . 45 The use of age - dependent cut - off values of D - dimer assays is still a matter of controversy . Several studies have shown that the levels of D - dimer assays increase with gestational age and in complicated pregnancies as observed in preterm labor , abruptio placenta , and gestational hypertension . 46 – 48 Elevated D - dimer was found to be predictive of poor outcome ( per - sistent thrombosis , recurrence or post - thrombotic syndrome ) in children with an acute thrombotic event . 49 False negative D - dimer results have been noted after heparin use ; hence it has been recommended that D - dimer assay should be done prior to administering heparin to a patient . 43 Other causes of false negative D - dimer results are late presentation ( symp - toms longer than 2 weeks ) and small below - knee DVT . venous ultrasonography Venous ultrasonography is the investigation of choice in patients stratified as DVT likely . 50 It is noninvasive , safe , available , and relatively inexpensive . There are three types of venous ultrasonography : compression ultrasound ( B - mode imaging only ) , duplex ultrasound ( B - mode imaging and Doppler waveform analysis ) , and color Doppler imaging alone . In duplex ultrasonography , blood flow in normal vein is spontaneous , phasic with respiration , and can be augmented by manual pressure . In color flow sonography , pulsed Doppler signal is used to produce images . 51 Compression ultrasound is typically performed on the proximal deep veins , specifically the common femoral , femoral , and popliteal veins , whereas a combination of duplex ultrasound and color duplex is more often used to investigate the calf and iliac veins . 52 The major ultrasonographic criterion for detecting venous thrombosis is failure to compress the vein lumen under gentle probe pressure . Other criteria for ultrasonographic diagnosis of venous thrombosis include loss of phasic pattern in which flow is defined as continuous , response to valsava or augmen - tation ( Duplex ultrasound ) , and complete absence of spectral or color Doppler signals from the vein lumen . 53 The other advantages of venous ultrasound are its ability to diagnose other pathologies ( Baker’s cysts , superficial or intra - muscular hematomas , lymphadenopathy , femoral aneurysm , superficial thrombophlebitis , and abscess ) , and the fact that there is no risk of exposure to irradiation , while its major limita - tion is its reduced ability to diagnose distal thrombus . 22 Venous compressibility may be limited by a patient’s characteristics such as obesity , edema , and tenderness as well as by casts or immobilization devices that limit access to the extremity . Com - pression B - mode ultrasonography with or without color Duplex imaging has a sensitivity of 95 % and a specificity of 96 % for diagnosing symptomatic , proximal DVT . 54 For DVT in the calf vein , the sensitivity of venous ultrasound is only 73 % . 55 Repeat or serial venous ultrasound examination is indicated for initial negative examination in symptomatic patients who are highly suspicious for DVT and in whom J ou r na l o f B l ood M ed i c i ne do w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / www . do v ep r e ss . c o m / b y 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 on 11 - J an - 2019 F o r pe r s ona l u s e on l y .

Serial testing has been found unnecessary for those in whom DVT is unlikely by Wells score and has a negative D - dimer test . Contrast venography Venography is the definitive diagnostic test for DVT , but it is rarely done because the noninvasive tests ( D - dimer and venous ultrasound ) are more appropriate and accurate to perform in acute DVT episodes . It involves cannulation of a pedal vein with injection of a contrast medium , usually noniodinated , eg , Omnipaque . A large volume of Omnipaque diluted with normal saline results in better deep venous filling and improved image quality . 56 The most reliable cardinal sign for the diagnosis of phlebothrombosis using venogram is a constant intraluminal filling defect evident in two or more views . 56 Another reliable criterion is an abrupt cutoff of a deep vein , a sign difficult to interpret in patients with previous DVT . 57 It is highly sensitive especially in identifying the location , extent and attachment of a clot and also highly specific . Being invasive and painful remains its major setback . The patient is exposed to irradiation and there is also an additional risk of allergic reaction and renal dysfunction . Occasionally a new DVT may be induced by venography , 58 probably due to venous wall irritation and endothelial damage . The use of nonionic contrast medium has reduced considerably risks of anaphylactic reaction and thrombogenecity or may have even eliminated them . 59 , 60 impedance plethysmography The technique is based on measurement of the rate of change in impedance between two electrodes on the calf when a venous occlusion cuff is deflated . Free outflow of venous blood produces a rapid change in impedance while delay in outflow , in the presence of a DVT , leads to a more gradual change . 61 It is portable , safe , and noninvasive but its main drawback remains an apparent insensitivity to calf thrombi and small , nonobstructing proximal vein thrombi . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRi ) This investigative modality has high sensitivity in detect - ing calf and pelvic DVTs , 62 and upper extremity venous thromboses . 63 It is also relevant in ruling out differential diagnoses in patients suspected of DVT . MRI is the diag - nostic test of choice for suspected iliac vein or inferior vena caval thrombosis when computed tomography venography is contraindicated or technically inadequate . There is no risk of ionizing radiation but it is costly , scarce , and reader expertise is required . Algorithm for the diagnosis of DvT The first step is the pretest probability assessment using an established model such as the Wells score ( Figure 1 ) . If score is # 1 ( DVT unlikely ) , D - dimer assay is done . If assay is negative , DVT is excluded and the patient can be discharged without further investigations . If assay is positive , a venous ultrasound is indicated . Negative venous ultrasound scan excludes the diagnosis of DVT . Diagnosis of DVT is made if venous ultrasonography is positive . If the DVT is likely ( probability score $ 2 ) , venous ultrasonography is indicated . DVT is diagnosed and treated if venous ultrasound is positive . If negative , D - dimer assay should be done . Negative D - dimer excludes the diagnosis of DVT while a positive result is an indication for follow - up studies ; repeat ultrasound in 6 to 8 days or do venography . This algorithm is not used in pregnancy because D - dimer is falsely elevated . Prophylaxis Mechanical Mechanical methods of prophylaxis against DVT include intermittent pneumatic compression ( IPC ) device , graduated compression stocking ( GCS ) , and the venous foot pump . Intermittent pneumatic compression enhances blood flow in the deep veins of the leg , preventing venous stasis and hence preventing venous thrombosis . 64 Agu et al have shown that these mechanical methods reduce postoperative venous thrombosis . 65 A Cochrane review showed a reduction of Table 1 Pretest probability assessment ( wells score ) Points Active cancer ( treatment ongoing or within previous 6 months or palliative ) 1 Paralysis , paresis , or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities 1 Recently bedridden for 3 days or major surgery within 12 weeks requiring general or regional anesthesia 1 Localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep veins 1 entire leg swollen 1 Calf swelling 3 cm . asymptomatic side ( measured 10 cm below tibial tuberosity ) 1 Pitting edema limited to the symptomatic leg 1 Collateral superficial veins ( nonvaricose ) 1 Previous DvT 1 Alternative diagnosis as likely as or more likely than DvT − 2 Notes : DvT unlikely : # 1 ; DvT likely : $ 2 J ou r na l o f B l ood M ed i c i ne do w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / www . do v ep r e ss . c o m / b y 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 on 11 - J an - 2019 F o r pe r s ona l u s e on l y .

Compared with pharmacological prophylaxis alone , combined modalities reduce significantly the incidence of DVT , but the effect on PE is unknown . This is recommended especially for high - risk patients . 68 A mechanical method of DVT prophylaxis is indicated in patients at high risk of bleeding with anticoagula - tion prophylaxis . These includes patients with active or recent gastrointestinal bleeding , patients with hemor - rhagic stroke , and those with hemostatic defects such as severe thrombocytopenia . 69 It is contraindicated in patients with evidence of leg ischemia due to peripheral vascu - lar disease . There is a theoretical risk of fibrinolysis and clot dislodgement . 70 Leg wrappings and stockings with no pressure gradient are ineffective in the prevention of DVT . 71 Hilleren - Listerud demonstrated that knee - length GCS and IPC devices are as effective as thigh - length GCS and IPC devices . They are also more comfortable , cheaper and more user - friendly for the patient . 72 Chin et al compared the efficacy and safety of differ - ent modes of thromboembolic prophylaxis ( IPC , GCS , and enoxaparin ) for elective total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) in Asian patient and recommended IPC as the preferred method of thromboprophylaxis for TKA . 73 However no meaningful difference in performance between GCS and IPC was dem - onstrated by Morris and Woodcock . 74 Daily use of elastic compression stockings after proxi - mal DVT reduced the incidence of postphlebitis syndrome by 50 % . 20 Other mechanical means in both medical and surgical patients include ambulation and exercises involving foot exten - sion . They improve venous flow and should be encouraged .

Studies have shown that the incidence of all DVTs , proximal DVT , and all PE including fatal PE has been reduced by low - dose UFH . 75 , 76 LMWH has additional advantages over unfractionated heparin ( Table 2 ) . It can be given once or twice daily without laboratory monitoring . Other advantages are predictability , dose - dependent plasma levels , a long half - life , less bleeding for a given antithrombotic effect , and a lower incidence of heparin - induced thrombocytopenia than with UFH . 77 The risk of heparin - induced osteoporosis is lower with LMWH than with UFH as it does not increase osteoclast number and activity . 78 It has a far greater effect on inhibi - tion of factor Xa and a lesser effect on antithrombin III by inhibiting thrombin to a lesser extent than UFH . 79 Current contraindications to the early initiation of LMWH throm - boprophylaxis include the presence of intracranial bleeding , ongoing and uncontrolled bleeding elsewhere , and incom - plete spinal cord injury associated with suspected or proven spinal hematoma . Fondaparinux , a synthetic pentasaccharide , has been approved for prophylaxis of DVT . It is an indirect selective inhibitor of factor Xa which binds to antithrombin with high affinity in a reversible manner . Heparin - induced thrombocy - topenia has not been reported with fondaparinux as it does not interact with platelet function and aggregation , and has a predictable response . 80 Monitoring of prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time is also not required . In sum - mary , it has an equal or better effectiveness than currently available agents , a low bleeding risk , no need for laboratory monitoring , and once daily administration . Dabigatran is a new oral univalent direct thrombin inhibitor . Dabigatran etexilate is the prodrug of dabigatran . It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with a bioavailability of 5 % to 6 % . It has a half - life of 8 hours after single - dose administration and up to 17 hours after multiple doses with plasma levels that peak at 2 hours . 81 The drug is excreted largely unchanged via the kidneys . It has a low bioavailability ( 6 % ) , produces a predictable anticoagulant effect , and requires no coagulation monitoring . 81 Dabigatran has been approved in Canada and Europe for VTE prevention after orthopedic surgery . The RE - COVER trial compared dabigatran etexilate with warfarin for 6 months in patients with acute VTE ; dabigatran was as effective as warfarin in preventing recurrent VTE , with comparable major bleeding and significantly lower total bleeding rates . 82 , 83 Another study ( The RE - NOVATE II trial ) compared the efficacy and safety of oral dabigatran with subcutaneous enoxaparin for extended thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty . 82 Extended prophylaxis with oral dabigatran 220 mg once daily was as effective as subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg once daily in reducing the risk of VTE after total hip arthroplasty , and superior to enoxaparin for reducing the risk of major VTE . The risk of bleeding and safety profiles were similar . 84 Rivaroxaban is a potent and selective oral factor Xa inhibitor . It has a rapid onset of action , a high bioavailability ( 80 % ) , and a half - life of 4 to 12 hours . 81 EINSTIEN - DVT trial has shown that oral rivaroxaban is as effective in prevent - ing recurrence of symptomatic VTE as the current standard therapy of injectable LMWH , enoxaparin , or fondaparinux , and an oral vitamin K antagonist in well - managed patients . 85 The results of RECORD phase III trials have also shown that rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily is superior to the LMWH enoxaparin , when used for prophylaxis of VTE in orthopedic surgeries . 86 The drug also has the major advantages of once daily oral dosing and no required laboratory monitoring . Other drugs in this group such as apixaban and edoxaban are currently undergoing clinical trials . Oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin can be commenced preoperatively , at the time of sur - gery , or postoperatively for the prevention of VTE . 87 Warfarin is contraindicated in antepartum thromboprophylaxis because it crosses the placenta and can result in unwanted teratoge - nicity and bleeding in the fetus . 88 However the drug is safe during lactation as it does not accumulate in the breast milk to a substantial extent . 89 Unlike warfarin , heparin is safe and it is recommended both in pregnancy and lactation . 90 The use of aspirin alone is not recommended for throm - boprophylaxis against VTE for any patient group . Some studies on the use of aspirin as prophylactic agent for DVT have shown some degree of protection against VTE in hos - pitalized patients , 91 , 92 while other studies have either shown no benefit , 93 , 94 or have proven to be less effective to other thromboprophylactic agents . 95 , 96 The duration of thromboprophylaxis depends on the level of risk of VTE . For patients undergoing total hip replacement or hip fracture surgery , prolonged thromboprophylaxis beyond 10 days and up to 35 days is recommended especially for patients who are considered to be at high risk for VTE , while in patients admitted with acute medical illness thromboprophylaxis should be continued until discharge for the majority of the patients . 87 Treatment The goal of therapy for DVT is to prevent the extension of thrombus , acute PE , recurrence of thrombosis , and the J ou r na l o f B l ood M ed i c i ne do w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / www . do v ep r e ss . c o m / b y 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 on 11 - J an - 2019 F o r pe r s ona l u s e on l y .

The initial treatment usually involves achieving a therapeutic dose of UFH or LMWH , or with fondaparinux . Studies have shown that the efficacy of treatment with heparin largely depends on the ability to achieve a critical therapeutic ratio within the first 24 hours of treatment , 97 , 98 ie , achieving an activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) that is 1 . 5 times the mean of control value or the upper limit of normal aPTT range ( aPTT ratio ) of 1 . 5 to 2 . 5 . This level corresponds to a heparin blood level of 0 . 3 to 0 . 7 U / mL by amidolytic antifactor Xa assay . 99 Because of the advantages of LMWH , it is recommended over unfractionated UFH for treatment of acute DVT . UFH is , however , preferred in patients with severe renal failure as LMWH is mainly excreted via the kidneys . Heparin is initially given with warfarin and stopped after a minimum of 4 to 5 days , at which time the international normalized ratio ( INR ) should be within 2 . 0 to 3 . 0 ( therapeutic range ) . This overlap with warfarin is essential because factors II , IX , X will not be affected until after 5 days , hence the intrinsic clotting pathway is intact . The initial prolongation of INR is mainly due to the effect of depression of factor VII which has a half - life of 5 to 7 hours . Warfarin remains the drug of choice for long - term therapy to prevent clot formation once acute anticoagula - tion is achieved . LMWH is , however , preferred after long - term therapy of DVT in pregnancy as warfarin therapy is contraindicated , 100 and in patients with cancer . Long - term anticoagulant therapy with LMWH is more effective than warfarin at preventing recurrent venous thrombosis in cancer patients without a statistically significant bleeding risk . 101 The duration of anticoagulation depends on whether the patient has a first episode of DVT , ongoing risk factors for VTE disease , and known thrombophlebitis . 102 In patients with first proximal DVT occurring in the context of a transient risk factor such as surgery or trauma , the risk of recurrence is very low and a limited duration of treatment ( 3 months ) is adequate . 103 , 104 Long - term anticoagulation therapy should be considered for recurrent thromboses , patients with ongoing risk such as active cancer and a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE where no risk factors for bleeding are present , and where anticoagulation control is good . This may be particularly the case if D - dimer is raised after discontinuing anticoagulation , in males , in those with post - thrombotic syndrome , and in those with antiphospho - lipid antibodies . 43 , 105 Thrombolytic therapy This is rarely indicated . The risk of major bleeding , including intracranial hemorrhage , should be weighed against the benefits of a complete and rapid lysis of thrombi . It is indi - cated in massive DVT which leads to phlegmasia cerulean dolens and threatened limb loss . The available thrombolytic agents include tissue plasminogen activator , streptokinase , and urokinase . Endovascular thrombolytic methods have evolved consid - erably in recent years . Catheter - directed thrombolysis ( CDT ) can be used to treat DVTs as an adjunct to medical therapy . 106 Current evidence suggests that CDT can reduce clot burden and DVT recurrence and consequently prevent the formation of post - thrombotic syndrome compared with systemic anticoagu - lation . 106 Pharmacomechanical CDT is now routinely used in some centers for the treatment of acute iliofemoral DVT . 107 Appropriate indications may include younger individuals with acute proximal thromboses , a long life expectancy , and relatively few comorbidities . Limb - threatening thromboses may also be treated with CDT , although the subsequent mor - tality remains high . 106 A number of randomized controlled trials are currently underway comparing the longer - term outcomes of CDT compared with anticoagulation alone . Vena cava filters Vena cava filters are indicated in very few circumstances . They include absolute contraindication to anticoagulation , life - threat - ening hemorrhage on anticoagulation , and failure of adequate anticoagulation . 108 Absolute contraindications to anticoagula - tion include central nervous system ( CNS ) hemorrhage , overt gastrointestinal bleeding , retroperitoneal hemorrhage , massive hemoptysis , cerebral metastases , massive cerebrovascular acci - dent , CNS trauma , and significant thrombocytopenia ( , 50 , 000 / µ L ) . 108 They may be retrievable or nonretrievable , most of the newly developed ones being retrievable . Studies to assess the effectiveness of filters revealed significantly fewer patients suffering PE in the short term , but no significant effect on PE . There was a higher rate of recurrent DVT in the long term . 109 Complications of inferior vena cava filters include hematoma over the insertion site , DVT at the site of insertion , filter migration , filter erosion through the inferior vena cava wall , filter embolization , and inferior vena cava thrombosis / obstruction . 110 Conclusion DVT is a potentially dangerous clinical condition that can lead to preventable morbidity and mortality .

Prevention consists of both mechanical and pharmacological modalities and is encouraged in both inpatients and outpatients who are at risk of this condition . The goal of therapy for DVT is to prevent the extension of thrombus , acute PE , recurrence of thrombosis , and the development of late complication such as pulmonary hypertension and post - thrombotic syndrome .
