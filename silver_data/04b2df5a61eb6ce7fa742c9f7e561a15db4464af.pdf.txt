These facilities are at high risk of disease transmission due to close 39 contacts between people in prison and with the wider community . People in prison are also 40 vulnerable to severe disease given their high burden of co - morbidities . We developed a 41 mathematical model to evaluate the effect of various public health interventions , including 42 vaccination , on the mitigation of COVID - 19 outbreaks , applying it to prisons in Australia and 43 Canada . We found that , in the absence of any intervention , an outbreak would occur and 44 infect almost 100 % of people in prison within 20 days of the index case . However , the rapid 45 rollout of vaccines with other non - pharmaceutical interventions would almost eliminate the 46 risk of an outbreak . Our study highlights that high vaccination coverage is required for 47 variants with high transmission probability to completely mitigate the outbreak risk in 48 prisons . 49 50 51 All rights reserved .

Such facilities 54 ( including gaols / jails , prisons , and other custodial settings ) , termed here “prisons” , are 55 vulnerable to outbreaks of SARS - CoV - 2 and other highly transmissible respiratory infections 56 due to their congregate nature with unavoidable close contact between people . People in 57 prison are particularly vulnerable to severe COVID - 19 given the higher prevalence of co - 58 morbidities and poorer social determinants of health compared to the general population [ 2 , 59 6 , 7 ] . Prisons’ enclosed environments mean that SARS - CoV - 2 can easily spread between 60 people in prison , correctional and healthcare staff ( for an Australian prison setting and this 61 terminology will be used throughout the manuscript ) / correctional employees ( in a Canadian 62 prison setting ) , and visitors . The transfer of people in prison between correctional facilities 63 and into the community can also fuel outbreaks in other facilities and into surrounding 64 communities [ 8 ] . Prisons are therefore high - priority settings for coordinated public health 65 responses to the COVID - 19 pandemic and future outbreaks of other respiratory infections [ 3 , 66 9 - 12 ] . However , the response to COVID - 19 in prisons has been hampered due to limited 67 access and use of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) in resource limited settings , poorer 68 access and delay to the vaccination and vaccine hesitancy , security and logistical constraints , 69 frequent movement of people between correctional settings , and the continuous entry and exit 70 of people into the prison [ 13 - 17 ] . Correctional settings , therefore , require system - level and 71 evidence - based responses [ 18 , 19 ] . 72 There have been several modelling studies evaluating the potential impact of prison - specific 73 interventions to mitigate COVID - 19 outbreaks in correctional settings . It was estimated that a 74 large COVID - 19 outbreak would be expected in prisons without both non - pharmaceutical 75 interventions ( NPIs ) such as the use of PPE for people in prison and staff , decarceration of 76 All rights reserved .

These models , however , did not consider the heterogeneous 79 transmission network inside prisons , the characteristics of the population ( among whom there 80 is an increased risk of severe disease ) , and , for the most part , failed to use real - world data for 81 calibration . These previous studies also neglected to focus on the combination of public 82 health interventions that could potentially mitigate COVID - 19 outbreaks . To our knowledge , 83 this is the first study which has sought to model a combination of intervention strategies 84 using models validated with ‘real - world’ data . In this study , we aimed to develop a COVID - 85 19 model for two high - income prison settings in Australia and Canada and validate the model 86 outputs against outbreak data from these two settings , and sought to evaluate the potential 87 impact of various intervention scenarios in averting cases and morbidity . 88 89 90 Methods 91 We previously developed a COVID - 19 Incarceration model by expanding on an existing 92 spreadsheet model originally developed by Recidiviz ( https : / / www . recidiviz . org ) [ 29 ] to 93 capture additional complex features within prison environments , to reflect the mixing patterns 94 between people in prison and correctional and healthcare staff , and to model a broad range of 95 interventions and mitigation strategies for COVID - 19 outbreaks . The model is publicly 96 available under an open - access license ( GNU General Public License , Version 3 ) via GitHub 97 [ 30 ] along with a user manual .

The Canadian prison is the largest provincial prison in Quebec , where it 104 was the epicenter of the SARS - CoV - 2 epidemic , with a capacity of 1 , 400 adult men ( > 18 105 years old ) [ 31 , 32 ] . Both prisons experienced SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks while multiple non 106 pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) were in place , but prior to a vaccine being available . A 107 more detailed explanation of COVID - 19 outbreaks in both prisons and interventions 108 implemented will be explained later . 109 Model structure 110 The scenarios and structures of the model were informed by a reference group drawn from 111 both healthcare and correctional organizations . A detailed explanation of the model structure 112 is available elsewhere [ 33 ] . Here we provide a summary and focus on the intervention 113 scenarios investigated in the two settings . Briefly , the model is compartmental and 114 implemented in Microsoft Excel ( Redmond , WA ) . The model includes compartments 115 representing the number of people in prison and staff who are susceptible , exposed , 116 infectious , have mild illness , severe illness , are hospitalized , and recovered , with the number 117 of deaths and new infections calculated daily ( Figure 1 ) . The model incorporates potential 118 virus transmission between people in prison , correctional and healthcare staff , and visitors . It 119 allows the designation of the prevalence of vulnerabilities in the population which could lead 120 to severe COVID - 19 disease , varied numbers of close contacts , and the daily intake and 121 release of people in prison . People in prison are grouped by age in the model with a certain 122 proportion in each age group considered ‘vulnerable’ to severe COVID - 19 ( classified as a 123 All rights reserved .

Seven age - group cohorts were used for people in prison ( 0 - 19 , 20 - 44 , 45 - 124 54 , 55 - 64 , 65 - 74 , 75 - 84 , and 85 + years of age ) . The model incorporated the probability of 125 showing symptoms , being hospitalized , and moving to critical or intensive care among those 126 hospitalized ( Table 1 ) . Age - specific infection fatality rates were specified for each age group . 127 As people in prison enter the prison , they are allocated to each age group based on the age 128 distribution of the people currently incarcerated . The model is implemented in a difference 129 equation framework with the number of people in each compartment updated daily over 120 130 days . The model tracks people in prison who enter the prison either through reception or via 131 transfer from another correctional setting , the daily number of visitors , and correctional and 132 healthcare staff working at the site . People in prison leave the model population to reflect the 133 number that are released after the end of their sentence or released early as a public health 134 mitigation measure . We assumed symptomatic people in prison were not released until 135 recovered . Staff are assumed to attend the prison site every day . Individuals from the 136 community can visit the site every day to represent family visitors , but they are assumed to 137 only have a limited number of contacts each visit ( with a family member in prison and 138 correctional staff ) . 139 The COVID - 19 progression rates were based on published data . The transmission of COVID - 140 19 from infected to susceptible people per close contact with an infectious person had a value 141 of 0 . 05 for the alpha variant [ 34 ] , a value based on epidemics in Wuhan , China , accounting 142 for different contacts through school , home , work and other contacts . While distance used for 143 a close contact varies internationally , for the purposes of our analyses , we defined a close 144 contact to be a distance of less than 1 . 5 meters for longer than 15 minutes . We assumed the 145 transmission probability was 1 . 5 times higher for the delta variant [ 35 ] , and two times higher 146 for the omicron variant , compared to the alpha variant [ 26 , 27 ] . This transmission probability 147 was adjusted to reflect the variable of susceptibility by age , the use of PPE ( including masks , 148 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Viral shedding 149 during the course of infection was considered to be low during the exposed stage [ 36 ] , and 150 hospitalized patients ( assumed to be isolated ) and healthcare workers were assumed to always 151 wear PPE ( assumed to be 1 in the ‘Infectious’ stage and from 0 ‘Exposure’ to 0 . 8 among 152 healthcare staff ( Table 1 ) ) . The number of contacts is specified in the model for each 153 population group , and we assumed homogeneous mixing within the modelled prison setting . 154 The effect of vaccination in preventing transmission and reducing hospitalization among 155 people in prison and staff receiving the first and second dose is detailed in Table 1 . 156 Interventions incorporated into the model 157 The effects of five intervention strategies to reduce the risk of COVID - 19 transmission were 158 incorporated into the model ( Figure 2 ) . All NPIs are delineated in light pink and vaccination 159 in dark orange . These include : 1 . Deferred incarceration or early release of people in prison 160 ( decarceration ) , 2 . Use of PPE by staff or people in prison , including gloves and masks , 3 . 161 Quarantine of new people in prison at reception ( assumed quarantine for 14 days for all 162 newly admitted people in prison in single cells ( preferred ) or in groups ( if quarantine capacity 163 is limited ) , 4 . Isolation of people in prison with suspected or proven infection ( assumed 164 isolation for 14 days ) , and 5 . Vaccination of people in prison and staff . Each intervention was 165 simulated individually or in combination ( combining interventions from 1 to 4 ) for NPIs , and 166 a combination of NPI with vaccination ( combining interventions from 1 to 5 ) . 167 Demographic data 168 We collected data regarding demographics and prison characteristics from Corrective 169 Services NSW ( CSNSW ) and the Justice Health & Forensic Mental Health Network 170 ( JHFMHN ) for the Australian prison and the Ministry of Public Security [ 37 , 38 ] for the 171 Canadian prison .

Although staff work 176 in shifts , they were assumed to intermingle extensively during each shift resulting in a high 177 number of contacts and sufficient enough to transmit the virus during shifts . The number of 178 contacts per healthcare staff ) was estimated from the number of patients seen per day . It was 179 assumed that 70 - 80 % of healthcare staff have close contact with other correctional staff 180 ( personal communication with CSNSW and JHFMHN reference group ) . As this information 181 was not available for the Canadian prison , we used similar intermingling and number of 182 contacts per inmate and staff as the Australian prison as both facilities have similar structures 183 and resources . We gathered all the detailed data explained above through consultation with 184 the reference group which was then incorporated into the parameters . 185 The Baseline scenario 186 The Australian prison experienced an outbreak with the delta variant from 11 August 2021 187 following multiple entries of infected inmates and staff . There were multiple NPIs in place at 188 the time of the outbreak including : decarceration of people in prison , reduction in contacts , 189 quarantine for 14 days at reception ( entry ) , isolation of people in prison with suspected or 190 proven infection , PPE for people in prison and staff , and thermal screening of non - essential 191 staff and family visitors . Note that decarceration of people in prison in the Australian prison 192 strategy was existed but the population size was not changed during the outbreak of COVID - 193 19 . 194 The Canadian prison experienced an outbreak during the early stages of the pandemic from 195 15 April 2020 when staff infected with the alpha variant entered the prison . Prior to this 196 outbreak , there were several NPIs already in place aimed at controlling the number of close 197 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Distribution of PPE to all people in prison was introduced in 200 this prison during the outbreak from 2 June 2020 onwards . 201 To correspond to what is believed to have occurred and set a ‘baseline scenario’ for both the 202 Australian and Canadian prison models ( Figure 3 ) , we used the prison - specific demographic 203 data as well as the interventions in place at the time of each prison’s first outbreak . No 204 vaccines were available in either prison at the time of the outbreak , however , vaccination 205 began in the Australian prison among people in prison and staff during the outbreak and it 206 likely contributed to mitigating the outbreak . In the Canadian prison , the first vaccine was 207 administered on April 30 , 2021 ( personal communication on 19 January 2022 , CIUSSS du 208 Nord - de - l’Île - de - Montréal ) . A counterfactual ‘no - response’ scenario was run to see how 209 large the COVID - 19 outbreak could have been with no interventions in place ( Figure 3 ) . 210 Applications of the model 211 Scenarios simulated 212 We simulated each model intervention separately ( using scenarios 1 to 5 ) and in a 213 combination scenario for 120 days to project the potential epidemic of COVID - 19 within 214 people in prison and staff . The number of hospital and intensive care unit ( ICU ) beds required 215 are estimated from the model . 216 For the vaccination scenarios , on the advice of the reference group for the Australian prison , 217 we assumed 50 % of people in prison and 100 % of staff were vaccinated ( an estimate of the 218 likely achievable coverage as vaccination of staff was mandated in the prison system ) . We 219 assumed the same vaccination coverage among people in prison and staff in the Canadian 220 prison as this information was not available . For intervention scenarios , we used the beta 221 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

We further simulated a vaccination scenario using the omicron 223 variant in both prisons to assess the possible impact of vaccination status in reducing 224 COVID - 19 outbreaks for variants with a higher transmission probability ( Appendix ) . 225 226 Results 227 Model calibration and validation : impact of model assumptions in the Australian and 228 Canadian prisons 229 Our model matched both the Australian and Canadian COVID - 19 outbreaks well ( Figure 3 ) . 230 In the Australian prison , where all NPIs were in place before the outbreak , the infections 231 peaked on day 23 ( Figure 3 ) with the first death from COVID - 19 on day 26 . The model 232 estimated that there would have been 850 cumulative infections over 120 days with 1 . 7 % of 233 cases hospitalized at the peak of the infection ( Table 2 ) . In the Canadian prison , the infections 234 peaked on day 28 , with the first death from COVID - 19 on day 33 . The model estimated that 235 there would have been 910 cumulative infections over 120 days with 80 people hospitalized 236 at the peak of the infection ( Table 2 ) . Although the modelled estimates were higher than the 237 number of people who were diagnosed with COVID - 19 in the Canadian prison , we believe 238 that there were undiagnosed cases in the prison ( personal communication on 28th July 2020 , 239 CIUSSS du Nord - de - l’Île - de - Montréal ) . Therefore , the estimated modelling outbreak ( blue 240 line ) was used as the baseline to assess the impact of the interventions compared to the 241 baseline scenario . 242 Absence of interventions 243 Australian prison 244 All rights reserved .

Within 120 days of the outbreak , a total of 180 deaths due to COVID - 248 19 were estimated ( with deaths yet to plateau by 120 days ; Table 2 ) . At the peak of 249 prevalence , approximately 84 % of correctional and 92 % of healthcare staff would also be 250 infected and unable to attend work at the prison ( Appendix , Figure A . 1 ) . Furthermore , our 251 model estimated that if no response were in place , 470 hospital including 70 ICU beds would 252 be needed at the peak of the outbreak in the local hospital facility ( Table 2 ) . 253 Canadian prison 254 For the following intervention scenarios in the Canadian prison , the delta variant was used to 255 ensure consistency with the Australian prison . The model showed that , in the absence of a 256 public health response ( no response scenario ) , there would have been a large spike of 257 COVID - 19 cases ( assuming admissions and releases continue ) with almost 100 % of people in 258 prison becoming infected within 20 days ( Figure 3 ) . In this scenario , a total of 4 , 520 people 259 in prison and staff would be infected during 120 days of an outbreak , with 160 deaths ( Table 260 2 ) . At the peak of the prevalence among people in prison , 94 % of correctional and 83 % of 261 healthcare staff would also be infected and unable to attend work at the prison ( Appendix 262 A . 1 ) . Our model estimated that if no response were in place , 320 hospital including 50 ICU 263 beds would be needed at the peak of the outbreak ( Table 2 ) . 264 265 Interventions 266 Australian prison 267 All rights reserved .

The model also showed that each intervention would reduce 272 the number of occupied hospital and ICU beds ( Table 2 ) . In combination , the interventions 273 ( baseline ) led to a substantially reduced outbreak with 77 % fewer infections during the 120 - 274 day outbreak period compared to the no - response scenario ( Figure 4 ( a ) , Table 2 ) . 275 Canadian prison 276 In the Canadian prison , decarceration also had the biggest impact in reducing cumulative 277 infection over 120 days ( 69 % reduction ) , followed by PPE ( 17 % reduction ) , quarantine at 278 reception ( 12 % reduction ) , and isolation of people in prison ( 5 % reduction ) ( Figure 4 ( b ) , 279 Table 2 ) . The impact of isolation was smaller in the Canadian prison than in the Australian 280 prison due to the reduced capacity for isolation and quarantine of people in prison ( a 281 maximum of 100 inmates for isolation and 252 for quarantine in the Canadian prison 282 compared to a maximum of 900 for isolation and quarantine in the Australian prison ) . In the 283 baseline scenario , 80 % of COVID - 19 infections were averted compared to the no - response 284 scenario over 120 days ( Figure 4 ( b ) , Table 2 ) . 285 Vaccination coverage among people in prison with / without NPIs 286 The model predicted immunization of people in prison and staff would have a substantial 287 impact on COVID - 19 outbreaks . Ensuring at least 50 % of people in prison are vaccinated 288 with 100 % of staff fully vaccinated ( following a mandate which occurred in Australia but not 289 in Canada ) from day 0 in both prison settings would completely prevent an outbreak from 290 occurring if other NPIs remain in place during the 120 - day outbreak period ( Figure 4 , Table 291 All rights reserved .

Our model predicted that 50 % vaccination coverage among people in prison is not enough 292 to prevent COVID - 19 outbreaks when transmission probability is high such as for the 293 omicron variant , which has twice the transmission probability of the alpha variant ( Appendix 294 Figure A . 2 & Figure A . 3 ) . Conversely , vaccinating 100 % of people in prison and staff would 295 prevent COIVD - 19 outbreaks for both beta and omicron variants ( Appendix Figure A . 2 & 296 Figure A . 3 ) . 297 Coverage of vaccination among staff 298 Ensuring 100 % of correctional and healthcare staff are fully vaccinated ( defined as a 299 minimum of two doses of any mRNA vaccine ) would mitigate transmission among staff even 300 without other NPIs ensuring there would be minimal impact on the workforce ( with delta 301 variant , Appendix Figure A . 4 ) . In this scenario , almost 77 % of the outbreaks among staff 302 would be reduced but would still occur among people in prison , with a slower growth rate 303 and a lower peak in daily infections , even if the outbreak was initiated by a staff member . 304 305 Discussion 306 We developed a mathematical model incorporating the infrastructure of prison settings , 307 COVID transmission , and disease dynamics . The model was used to assess combinations of 308 targeted public health strategies to illustrate epidemic patterns and the effect of prevention or 309 mitigation programs . The model can be readily adapted for application to different prison 310 settings and to other respiratory viruses with similar transmission patterns , and so could be 311 used for general pandemic preparedness in prison settings in the future . We applied the model 312 to two prisons in two high - income countries - Australia and Canada , including the key 313 characteristics of the prisons where real - world COVID - 19 outbreaks occurred . Our model 314 showed that modelling outputs predicted the COVID - 19 caseload well , and highlighted the 315 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Most importantly , our model 317 demonstrated that NPI combined with vaccination ( completely prevent an outbreak from 318 occurring ) was the most effective interventions , followed by decarceration ( 59 - 69 % reduction 319 in cumulative incidence over 120 days ) in reducing COVID - 19 outbreaks in prison settings . 320 The model showed that NPIs , and in particular , decarceration , can reduce the size of a 321 COVID - 19 outbreak within prisons and substantially reduce associated morbidity and 322 mortality . Reducing the prison population size ( decarceration ) , quarantine of people in prison 323 at reception , and isolation of symptomatic people in prison are designed to reduce close 324 contacts between infected and susceptible individuals—and essentially reduce the susceptible 325 population within a prison , while the widespread use of PPE and vaccination reduces the risk 326 of transmission during close contact . While these interventions are effective , our modelling 327 showed that an outbreak could still occur . Our findings are important for resource - limited 328 settings where access to vaccines in correctional settings may not available . For example , in 329 Cambodia , prison authorities were urged to take action to reduce COVID - 19 outbreaks [ 39 ] 330 as the average prison occupancy was greater than three times its capacity . Hence , a decision 331 to release people from prison ( primarily those who pose minimal risk to public safety ) was 332 made to reduce overcrowding [ 39 ] . Reducing the number of people entering or leaving 333 prisons to minimize the change of the COVID - 19 outbreaks was also introduced in NSW 334 prisons in the early outbreaks [ 40 ] 335 Where possible , vaccination of both people in prison and staff , combined with NPIs , will 336 mitigate all future outbreaks and should be prioritized in countries where this has not 337 occurred [ 41 ] . Our model highlighted that at the peak of prevalence among people in prison , 338 94 % of correctional and 83 % of healthcare staff would be infected and unable to attend work 339 at prison .

Additionally , the absence of correctional staff can lead to a breakdown of order and 344 security within the prison , making it more difficult to maintain the safety and rehabilitation of 345 people in prison . Thus , it is crucial to prioritize the health and safety of correctional staff in 346 order to ensure the overall well - being of both those incarcerated and the general public . It is 347 also important to note that maintaining a high level of booster uptake is essential to ensure the 348 immunity of both people in prison and staff in correctional settings which will help mitigate 349 the risk of new outbreaks occurring . 350 A recent modelling study in the United Kingdom assessed the impact of vaccination , 351 combined with various restriction levels ( different rules in place to reduce close contacts 352 including opening of non - essential shops , retails , traveling throughout the country or abroad , 353 national lockdown ) , in reducing the number of people hospitalized and deaths due to COVID - 354 19 [ 42 ] . The model highlighted that even with low level restrictions , vaccination can prevent 355 number of people being hospitalized . The feasibility of achieving this comprehensive 356 approach will likely vary across prisons , depending on the available resources , health and 357 correctional infrastructure , and nature of operations within the facility . Another modelling 358 study also showed that the combination of NPIs and vaccination can prevent deaths due to 359 COVID - 19 , but required immense effort [ 20 , 43 ] . For example , more than doubling of the 360 vaccination rate was needed to halve the deaths within 100 days [ 43 ] . Therefore , it is evident 361 that ongoing NPIs are needed in prison even if the vaccination rates are high , particularly 362 with the emergence of increasingly transmissible COVID - 19 variants . 363 There are some limitations to our study . It is important to note that as our model is 364 compartmental , it does not capture all the complexities within a prison , or the specific 365 All rights reserved .

This means it may overestimate the magnitude of an 366 outbreak in a prison where the internal structure includes multiple wings and yards that can 367 be isolated from each other in the event of an outbreak . Our model is also deterministic which 368 means it does not capture probabilistic effects when the infection numbers are small . The 369 model describes the movement between quarantine and isolation and the general prison 370 population as an average rate equal to the inverse of the quarantine / isolation period . This 371 means that there can be a slow release of infected individuals from quarantine / isolation in the 372 model catalyzing an outbreak earlier than what might be expected . Depending on the 373 intervention parameters , these are shown as a delayed trajectory with a slightly lower peak . 374 However , people in prison in quarantine / isolation may still interact with staff , and exposed 375 individuals may be released at the end of their quarantine / isolation periods , meaning that this 376 slow spread of infection from quarantine / isolation is not unrealistic . Our model did not take 377 into account the reduction in population size resulting from policing and court orders during 378 COVID - 19 outbreaks . For our next study , we plan to develop a more detailed individual - 379 based model that considers the movement of inmates between prisons and courts . Finally , our 380 model does not describe the impact of varied testing strategies for COVID - 19 . 381 Our study has several strengths . While our model was designed to investigate interventions 382 for SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in prisons , its structure is flexible enough to consider other 383 respiratory infections in other closed population settings by changing the transmission 384 probability . It also ensures flexibility to define and assess different scenarios and a 385 combination of targeted public health strategies to illustrate epidemic patterns and the effect 386 of prevention or mitigation programs . Here , we focused on COVID - 19 outbreaks in two 387 ‘real - world’ prison settings with intervention strategies to mitigate future outbreaks .

Therefore , our findings are likely 390 generalizable to female prisons . 391 In conclusion , our analysis demonstrates that the entry of one infected person into prison is 392 sufficient to establish an outbreak , infecting almost all people in prison within 120 days in the 393 absence of an intervention . A high vaccination coverage , in combination with other NPIs , 394 would eliminate the risk of an outbreak in a prison , but the feasibility of these interventions 395 will depend on both the health and custodial infrastructure of the facility . Lessons learnt from 396 this study can be used to evaluate other respiratory viruses in congregate settings in the future . 397 398 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .
