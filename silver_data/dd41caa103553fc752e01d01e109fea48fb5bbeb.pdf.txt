Disciplinar y Differences and Undergraduates’ Information - Seeking Behavior by Ethelene Whitmire JASIST , 53 ( 8 ) : 631 - 638 , 2002 presented by Christopher Maier 2004 - 10 - 26 INLS 279 : Bioinformatics Research Review Motivation • Previous works focused on faculty , graduate students • Look at undergraduates • Differences because information - seeking behaviors are not developed yet ? • Similarities because professors instill discipline - speciﬁc seeking habits ? Biglan’s Typolog y Hard Soft Paradigm Development Pure Applied Practicality Life Non - Life Object of Study Biglan’s Typolog y , Continued • Used as a framework in numerous examinations of the differences between various academic ﬁelds • This is the ﬁrst use of the typology in information and library science research Research Question Using Biglan’s Typology as a framework , will differences in information - seeking behavior be evident between different academic disciplines , as manifested by undergraduates in that ﬁeld ? The Data • Data drawn from 1996 College Student Experiences Questionnaire ( collected by Indiana University ) • Covers 5175 students from 38 4 - year institutions . Only majors in ﬁelds covered by Biglan’s typology were considered for this study - - no Biologists : ( Subject Break - down 22 % 22 % 24 % 32 % Freshman Sophomore Junior Senior 24 % 25 % 29 % 9 % 8 % 6 % Physical Sciences Engineering Humanities Business Social Sciences Education Questions • Information - seeking behavior assessed from self - reported measures of library usage Analysis • t - tests for each of three typology dimensions Findings : Hard vs . Soft Findings : Pure vs . Applied Findings : Life vs . Non - Life Results • Majors in soft , pure , life disciplines engaged in more information - seeking activities than hard , applied , non - life majors • Biglan’s Typology can be a useful framework in ILS research Considerations • This study looked at undergrads , not researchers established in their ﬁeld - - maybe undergrads don’t know what the important resources in their ﬁeld are yet • Lots of freshmen in sample - - not advanced in their ﬁeld , still doing basic stuff • Also looks at “current” or “anticipated” major , not necessarily what the student graduates with Discuss • Averages all hover around 2 , which translates to “occasionally” • Did hard , applied , non - life majors not seek information ? Problem with this study is that it couches information - seeking behavior in terms of physical library use . • How about different combinations , such as e . g . hard , pure , non - life majors ? Author suggests tailoring library services to each “tier” of disciplines Comments • Good • Large sample size , many universities • Bad • Limited to physical library services • “Paradigm” and “Practicality” axes of the typology not equally represented • Interesting to see results if limited to upperclassmen , or students doing “research” ( as opposed to e . g . ﬁnding information for a report )
