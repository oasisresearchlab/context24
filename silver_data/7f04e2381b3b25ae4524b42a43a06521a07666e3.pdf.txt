ORIGINAL ARTICLE Periodontal Disease Impairs Muscle Recovery by Modulating the Recruitment of Leukocytes Bárbara Capitanio de Souza , 1 , 4 Bibiana Franzen Matte , 1 André Luiz Lopes , 2 Bruno Costa Teixeira , 2 and Marcelo Lazzaron Lamers 1 , 3 Abstract — The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of periodontal disease ( PD ) associated with physical exercise on inflammatory mediators and muscle repair . Twenty - four Wistar rats were divided into four groups : control ( SH ) , healthy trained ( TH ) , sedentary with PD ( SP ) , and trained with PD ( TP ) . PD was induced in groups SP and TP while the trained groups performed treadmill exercises for 8 weeks . For the analysis of IL - 6 , IL - 10 , TNF - α , and leukocyte count , we collected blood samples . Cryolesions were induced in the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius , which were analyzed for morphological changes . The presence of PD modified leukocyte counts , while exercise showed an additive role . PD increased levels of IL - 6 , IL - 10 , and TNF - α , and physical exercise changed only values of IL - 10 . The association between physical exercise and PD was responsible for an increased concentration of leukocytes in the region of the inflammation . Serum levels of inflammatory markers were modified by PD and , when combined with exercise , may negatively modulate inflammation . The association between PD and physical exercise showed the most significant changes in the number of inflammatory cells and may negatively influence the process of muscle repair .

INTRODUCTION Periodontal disease ( PD ) is present in a high percent - age of the adult population and is characterized as an infectious and inflammatory disease with different levels of aggressiveness that affect the soft and hard tissues surrounding teeth [ 1 ] . The protective ( gingiva ) and sup - portive ( periodontium ) tissues surrounding teeth may de - velop an inflammatory response due to chronic oral bacte - ria accumulation [ 2 , 3 ] , which can modify several local and systemic inflammatory mediators , which might influence homeostasis in non - oral tissues [ 4 , 5 ] . PD is known to increase blood levels of several pro - inflammatory cytokines [ 6 ] , which makes PD a risk factor Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article ( https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1007 / s10753 - 019 - 01128 - 5 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users . 1 Dentistry School , Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul ( UFRGS ) , Porto Alegre , Brazil 2 Laboratory of Exercise Research ( LAPEX ) , College of Physical Educa - tion ( ESEF ) , Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul ( UFRGS ) , Porto Alegre , Brazil 3 Department of Morphological Sciences , Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul ( UFRGS ) , Porto Alegre , Brazil 4 To whom correspondence should be addressed at Dentistry School , Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul ( UFRGS ) , Porto Alegre , Brazil .

For instance , PD can modify the response of skeletal muscle cells to physical training [ 9 – 11 ] . The increased mechanical or chemical stress on skel - etal muscle cells leads to a decrease in the repair of dam - aged fibers , which can occur in different degrees , depend - ing on the type and load of the exercise that is performed [ 12 , 13 ] . Eccentric exercises with moderate intensities may cause muscle damage affecting the structure and muscle performance [ 11 ] . Some substances , whose expression is stimulated by exercises , such as free radicals and inflam - matory mediators , can induce severe alterations in the structure of crucial molecules responsible for the mainte - nance of cellular homeostasis , resulting in a possible loss of function or vitality of the cells [ 14 ] . The tissue repair process involves the synchronized action of cellular ( leukocytes ) and chemical ( cytokines ) elements in injured areas , to restore tissue homeostasis and structure [ 15 , 16 ] . It is a response of the body to any tissue damage caused by a wide variety of chemical and mechanical stimulation [ 17 ] . Disruption of this process may compromise the efficiency of the inflammatory re - sponse and result in reduced tissue repair [ 18 ] . Structural microlesions that occur during muscle ac - tivity can cause a decrease in the capacity to produce strength , which changes the maximum strength produced by the tissue , in addition to increasing the tension of the passive structures in the muscle [ 19 ] . This process in - creases the amount of protein in the blood , generating additional inflammatory responses linked to microlesions [ 19 , 20 ] . It is possible that changes in serum levels of inflam - matory markers , triggered by different chronic inflamma - tory situations such as PD , might indirectly influence the muscle repair process . The objective of study was to ana - lyze the role of the association between PD and treadmill training in muscle repair . It was observed that PD was able to modify the leukocyte count and levels of IL - 6 , IL - 10 , and TNF - α . When related to physical exercise , a PD negatively influenced the muscle repair process . MATERIAL AND METHODS Animal Model This study is under the Brazilian Law of Procedure for the Use of Animal for Science , and the Research Ethics Committee of UFRGS approved it ( approval # 19728 ) . All surgeries were performed under anesthesia , and all efforts were made to minimize suffering . Twenty - four male Wistar rats aged 60 days , weighing an average of 250 g , were provided by the animal colony of the UFRGS for this study . During the experiment , the animals were kept in collective polypropylene cages ( 3 animals per cage ) . The rats were fed with balanced rodent chow and water ad libitum , and kept in a photoperiodic cycle of 12 h light / dark . The animals were randomly divided into four exper - imental groups using stratified randomization by weight , with six rats in each of the following groups : control ( SH ) , healthy and trained ( TH ) , with PD and sedentary ( SP ) , and with PD and trained ( TP ) . The experimental model is illustrated in Fig . 1 . All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . The number of animals per group was kept at the minimum for ethical reasons but still enough to reach statistical signifi - cance . Individuals blinded to all groups performed all measurements and assessments . The process of identifying was known only to an external researcher . Induction of PD The induction of PD was performed by ligation [ 21 , 22 ] by a trained operator . The animals were sedated via IP xylazine ( 1 mg / kg ) and then anesthetized via IP sodium pentobarbital ( 15 mg / kg ) . After anesthesia , the cervical region of the upper second and mandibular first molars of the rats from the SP and TP groups received a sterile 4 . 0 silk suture . In our experimental model , it was observed predominantly gingival inflammation . Treadmill Exercise Protocol The treadmill exercise protocol started after the 30th day of the placement of the ligatures ( TP ) and lasted for 8 weeks with a frequency of 5 days / week . The protocol was adapted from the study for the verification of the anaerobic threshold in rats and consisted of daily exercise with a gradual increase in speed until approximately 70 % of the speed capability of the animal was attained . The provision for exercise duration , as well as the corresponding velocity , was adjusted ( Table 1 ) . The animals were weighed throughout the weeks of training . Muscle Cryolesion To analyze the muscle response to damage , at the end of the exercise protocol , the animals underwent a muscle injury by cryolesion [ 23 ] . For this purpose , the animals were sedated with xylazine ( 1 mg / kg ) and anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium ( 15 mg / kg ) . A trained operator 383 Periodical Disease Impairs Muscle Recovery performed the procedure . For the cryolesion induction , a 6 mm diameter metal rod , previously immersed in liquid nitrogen ( 20 seconds ) , was pressed directly against the muscle of the left leg of the animal for 10 seconds . After the bat had cooled down , the procedure was repeated on the same muscle . The injury was performed twice . A homologous paw was used to control the surgery . The rats received acetaminophen diluted in water ( 110 – 300 mg / kg / day ) in order to avoid discomfort after the cryolesion / surgery . After the cryolesion , the animals did not perform any exercise and were sacrificed 3 days after the cryolesion with an anesthetic overdose . Blood Collection Blood samples were collected from the tail vein at the end of the 8th weeks of the exercise protocol and 3 days after cryolesion and centrifuged ( 1 ml , 4oC , 3200 gm , 10 min ) . The serum was stored at − 80 °C until the time for analysis . Inflammatory markers ( IL - 6 , IL - 10 , and TNF - α ) in serum were measured by ELISA ( enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ) ( BD Bioscience , San Diego , CA ) . The blood analysis was performed by modification of absorbance at a wavelength of 450 nm with a correction to 560 nm using an ELISA reader ( xMark Absorbance Microplate Spectrophotometer , Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) . During blood collection , blood smear slides were dried and stained with the hematologic dye panoptic ( MG RENYLAB CHEM FARM LTD , Barbacena ) . A single - blinded and calibrated observer performed the leukocyte count in relative values ( % ) before and during the study ( Kappa inter - and intra - rater 0 . 8 – 0 . 882 ) .

Sample Preparation for Microscopy The thymus , gastrocnemius , and tibialis anterior mus - cles were collected , fixed in methacarn solution ( 60 % methanol , 10 % acetic acid , and chloroform 30 % , 4 h , 4 °C ) , dehydrated ( ethanol ) , diaphanized ( xylol ) , and embed - ded in paraffin ( Paraplast® Oxford , St . Louis , MO . , USA ) . Slices ( 5 μ m ) were made with a microtome and subjected to regular hematoxylin – eosin ( HE ) staining protocol . The images were captured by a video camera system ( JVC , TK - C620 , Victor Co , Tokyo , Japan ) coupled to a binocular microscope ( Olympus Optical Co . , Tokyo , Japan ) at 200 × or 400 × magnification . Images were recorded using Microsoft VidCap 32 ( Microsoft Corp . Software , USA ) . Morphometric Analysis The replacement of the thymic parenchyma by adipose tissue was used as a criterion for thymic degeneration . Three randomly selected thymic HE - stained slices and 200 × mag - nification pictures were analyzed from 5 different areas for each slice . The volumetric density of fat cells was quantified using a test system ( M - 42 ) ( Supplementary Fig . 1A ) , which analyzed the measured relative density of the tissue . The formula V = Pp / Ptx100 % was used , where Pt was the total number of points applied on the picture ( 42 in this case ) , and Pp was the number of points that relies on fat cells . The fat volumetric density was calculated using the average of the values obtained from the five areas analyzed for each slice [ 26 – 28 ] . The percentage of inflammatory cells was divided into three different regions of the lesion : ( 1 ) center of the lesion , ( 2 ) adjacent region without inflammation , and ( 3 ) intermedi - ate region in order to analyze the inflammatory intensity of the muscle samples that underwent cryolesion . For each muscle sample , three randomly selected HE - stained slices were se - lected , and 3400 × magnification pictures were taken for each region of the lesion . For each picture , the M - 42 test system ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) was used to determine the volumetric density of inflammatory cells using the formula V = Pp / Ptx100 % , where Pt was the total number of points on the picture ( 42 in this case ) and Pp was the number of points that relies on inflammatory cells . The volumetric density was calculated by the average of the values obtained from the three pictures from each of the three regions of the lesion presented in each slice [ 26 – 28 ] . Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed using SPSS ( Statistical Package for Social Sciences ) version 17 . 0 for Windows . The results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and percent - age . Data were submitted for analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) , and a post hoc Tukey test and means were compared by F test at 5 % . RESULTS PD Is Associated with Changes in Mice Leukocyte Count Histomorphometric analysis of the replacement of parenchyma by adipose tissue of the thymus indicated no difference between the experimental groups ( Supplementary Fig . 1B ) , which suggested that chronic induction of PDs ( 90 days ) and the physical protocol used in this study did not cause any significant change to the immune response . The thymus is a small gland that is responsible for the production of T lymphocytes . The presence of degenerative changes within the thy - mus , such as necrosis , cellular debris , calcifications , and cystic changes , could indicate its inflammation - driven reduction [ 29 , 30 ] . By the end of the experiment , the trained rats without PD ( TH ) showed no significant changes in any of the components of white blood cell count when compared to the control groups ( SH ) . Before cryolesion , the sedentary ( SP ) and trained ( TP ) animals with PD had higher circu - lating in the levels of lymphocytes ( 71 % , 72 . 4 % , respec - tively , p < 0 . 01 , n = 6 ) and lower neutrophil levels ( 25 % and 23 % , respectively , p < 0 . 01 , n = 6 ) when compared to the control group ( Fig . 2A and B ) . After 3 days of cryolesion induction , the control and trained animals without PD had a similar leukocyte count . However , the groups with PD had lower mono - cyte counts . The association between treadmill training and PD was also associated with higher neutrophil and eosinophil levels ( 28 % and 1 . 8 % , respectively , p < 0 . 01 , n = 6 ) . These data suggest that the association between physical training and PD might be linked to an extended acute phase of the inflammatory response in muscle lesions . Inflammatory Cytokines and Muscular Strength The analysis of the plasma levels of cytokines dem - onstrated that before the injury , isolated exercise caused an 385 Periodical Disease Impairs Muscle Recovery increase in the levels of anti - inflammatory interleukins . PD also induced an increase in pro - inflammatory ( TNF - α and IL - 6 ) ( Fig . 3 ) cytokines . These data suggest that PD can induce a pro - inflammatory reaction . After 3 days of cryolesion , all experimental groups showed an increase in cytokine levels when compared to the control group , al - though groups with PD still presented higher levels of IL - 6 and TNF - α . The association of physical activity with PD maintained high levels of IL - 10 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . The analysis of the intensity of the inflammation in the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscle ( Fig . 4A and B , respectively ) after 3 days of cryolesion induction indicated that the central region of the lesion of seden - tary and trained animals without PD had similar levels of inflammatory cells . The association between PD and physical exercise showed the most significant change in the number of inflammatory cells in the central ( tibialis anterior 71 . 4 % and gastrocnemius 85 % ) and the middle region ( tibialis anterior 62 . 5 % and gastrocnemius 71 % ) of the lesion . DISCUSSION A variety of infectious – inflammatory diseases , along with PD , may modulate the degree of systemic immune response by regulating the profile of circulating leukocytes and serum levels of interleukins , which may influence the process of regeneration / repair [ 31 , 32 ] . During the inflammatory process in the periodontal tissues , the stimulation and release of inflammatory medi - ators , and the cells of the immune system , especially cyto - kines such as IL - 1 β , IL - 6 , IL8 , and TNF - α , are responsible for monitoring the immune response [ 33 , 34 ] . Moreover , a study previously published revealed the contribution of PD in the maintenance of chronic inflation through the activa - tion of specific intracellular pathways [ 35 ] . In this study , we demonstrated that PD induces an increase in pro - inflammatory mediators in sedentary and trained rats , which is associated with the repair of injured striated muscles by the cryolesion response , and this effect is exacerbated by moderate treadmill exercise .

It has been shown that activation of these cells may be influenced by local or systemic levels of inflam - matory mediators such as IL - 6 [ 36 – 38 ] . Moderate physical exercise can cause an increase in the anti - inflammatory profile , in addition to maintaining the levels of circulating cortisol [ 39 ] , which allow the correct activation of these cells . The release of cytokines such as IL - 6 and TNF - α in muscle tissue due to chronic inflammatory processes has shown a high capacity to compromise homeostasis of local metabolic pathways since the presence of inflammatory macrophages in the injured area in the skeletal muscle damages the repaired tissue [ 40 ] . The WBC profile indicated that there was significant leukocyte recruitment after injury . For the group with PD , a significant difference in the increase of neutrophils was observed , which may slow the healing process , because some studies have shown that neutrophils play a crucial role in tissue repair . The secondary damage is through the release of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and proteases , as well as phagocytosis and monocyte recruitment by releas - ing cytokines [ 41 , 42 ] . Although leukocytes are necessary for proper tissue repair through the secretion of growth factors and cytokines that coordinate myogenesis [ 35 ] factors , deregulation of the expression of inflammatory cytokines resulting from increased recruitment of these cells or prolonged accumulation in the injured area may lead to a deficient healing process [ 43 – 46 ] . The WBC results also indicated a significant increase in eosinophils in the trained group with PD . The inflam - matory process also increased the activation of eosinophils , which contribute to muscle lysis by lymphocytes and an increase in the production of major basic protein - 1 ( major basic protein - 1 , MBP - 1 ) . Eosinophils can also increase muscle fibrosis with MBP - dependent processes and nega - tively regulate cellular immune response to the injured Fig . 4 .

Additionally , monocyte – macrophage precur - sor levels were reduced in the group with PD and increased in the trained group and disease - free after induction of muscle injury . These cells play an essential role in muscle repair as macrophages originate from different strains re - sponsible for promoting the differentiation and prolifera - tion of satellite cells [ 22 , 46 ] . This finding suggests that PD slows the process of muscle repair . The results of the analysis of myeloid cells correlate with the results of the histomorphological analysis of areas where muscle damage was present . The anterior tibial and gastrocnemius quantified passionate intensity indicates that groups with PD have a higher number of inflammatory cells in the three areas analyzed . Moreover , the association of PD with exercise showed an additive effect , which may have been responsible for prolonging the local inflamma - tory events . The results obtained from the analyses of serum levels of inflammatory mediators indicate that PD altered the levels of IL - 6 , TNF - α , and IL - 10 , with a cumulative effect with exercise . The increase in cytokines such as IL - 6 and TNF - α , after muscle injury , indicates that these substances may contribute to the regeneration process . The analysis of the levels of IL - 10 shows that on the third day after the injury , the group of trained animals with PD had significantly higher values when compared to other groups . This suggests that the induction of PD had an additive effect on the inflammatory response , which in - duced greater recruitment of IL - 10 . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first study which shows that PD is associated with an increase in pro - inflammatory mediators in sedentary and trained rats , which is correlated with changes in the repair of injured striated muscles by the cryolesion response , and that this effect is exacerbated by moderate exercise on a treadmill . Physical exercise can trigger different levels of mus - cle injuries , and the process of muscle repair involves the activation of satellite cells , which are myogenic precursor cells [ 36 ] . It has been shown that activation of these cells may be influenced by local or systemic levels of inflam - matory mediators such as IL - 6 and TNF - α [ 41 ] . Exercise can also cause an increase in anti - inflammatory mediators such as the expression of IL - 10 and regulates the levels of circulating cortisol , which allow for correct activation of these cells [ 29 , 39 ] . The analyses of serum levels of inflammatory mediators in PD indicate altered levels of IL - 6 , TNF - α , and IL - 10 and an additive effect when combined with physical exercise for IL - 6 and IL - 10 . The increase of cytokines such as IL - 6 and TNF - α after muscle injury indicates that these substances may contribute to the regenerative process , stimulating in - flammatory cells to initiate the process of tissue repair [ 31 ] . In this study , the analysis of the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior showed that the inflammatory PD groups had a more significant number of inflammatory cells in the three muscle areas . Furthermore , it was found that the asso - ciation between PD and physical exercise was cumulative . CONCLUSION The results indicate that PD influenced the modula - tion of the inflammatory process that occurred in the area of muscle injury by increasing inflammatory markers , es - pecially IL - 6 and TNF - α . Besides , when PD was associat - ed with exercise , the effects of muscle recovery after injury were impaired . The data indicate that there should be concern about the consequences of the inflammatory reac - tion caused by PD and the practice of intense physical exercise to explain possible injury processes and worse muscle recovery .
