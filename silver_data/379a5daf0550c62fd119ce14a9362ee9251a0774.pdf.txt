The centrosome excluded this source of signal . During rescent [ 43 ] . We followed the dynamics of the plasma membrane in cleaving cells by using multiphoton time - metaphase , the chromatin and adjacent spindle also ex - cluded these vesicles , although subresolution vesicles lapse microscopy [ 44 , 45 ] . were still present around the centrosomes ( Figure 3c ) . Upon anaphase onset , we observed diffuse , small - vesicle Following the completion of an ingressed furrow , we ob - served a pronounced accumulation of membrane oc - staining that became localized to the spindle midzone region ( Figure 3d ) . This staining was conspicuous from curring at the leading edge of the ingressed furrow that forms the intercellular canal ( n 5 13 ; Figure 4a , 4 – 12 anaphase through telophase and eventually diminished in intensity after this time . During late telophase , we min ) . This accumulation persisted until 5 – 7 min into the next cell cycle . Prior to the next division , it appeared that observed larger vesicles moving parallel to midzone micro - tubules toward the equatorial plane ( Figure 3e ) . After the cell division remnant was internalized along with this bolus of accumulated membrane and moved toward a the furrow ingressed , movement along the axis of the intercellular canal was observed ( see Movie 5 ) . The exact centrosome ( n 5 4 ; Figure 4a , 16 . 0 min ) . role and function of these vesicles remains unclear at this time .

For example , actin - myosin rings and a requirement for secretion are common to both animal and plant cells [ 14 , 18 , 19 , 31 , 46 ] . The work described in this paper suggests , however , that secretion is required not only for initial furrowing events , but also during the terminal stages that finally separates the two daughter cells from each other . Using 4D - multiphoton microscopy , we observed FM1 – 43 - labeled membrane accumulating immediately after the furrow became fully ingressed . Such accumulation could be caused by Golgi - derived vesicles that are targeted to the apex of the cleavage furrow , where they exocytose . Alternatively , membrane could accumulate by flowing down the apex of the furrow into the tip . When a cell cleaves , the surface area has to increase , which implies that new plasma membrane has to be inserted . We found that BFA treatment did not inhibit furrowing . Indeed , following a cytokinesis failure , multiple furrows formed Internal membrane dynamics in early embryos labeled with Bodipy between all pairs of centrosomes . These observations BFA .

However , perhaps a more likely explanation is that pericentrosomal region excludes larger vesicles , whereas the the plasma membrane of the cells that we study have centrosomes and nucleus exclude all membrane staining .

The midbody in animal cells to be required for proper spindle alignment [ 51 ] . could therefore be a spindle - derived scaffold for various targeted proteins involved in cell separation events as Secretion , motor molecules , and cytokinesis well as spindle alignment events ( Figure 6 ) . The involvement of BFA - sensitive pathways ( this study ; [ 31 ] ) and syntaxins [ 19 ] in cytokinesis raises the possibility that other evolutionarily conserved molecules involved in It is possible that kinesin molecules bound to vesicles secretion , such as the dynamins or Rab GTPases , might could move dynactin / dynein ( also bound to these vesicles ) be necessary during animal cytokinesis , as seen in plants . to plus ends of microtubules that reside in the intercellular Recent studies of Rabkinesin 6 [ 52 ] , XKLP3 [ 53 ] , and a canal .

Inhibition of kinesin or 742 Current Biology Vol 11 No 10 Figure 5 Membrane dynamics in an isolated blastomere treated with BFA . The furrow remained ingressed for 5 . 5 min before regressing in the BFA - multiphoton time course of a P 0 blastomere labeled with FM1 - 43 in treated embryo . This time corresponds to the time in which membrane the presence of BFA is shown . The figure shows a sequence of 3D accumulation would have normally occurred in untreated blastomeres ; projections of a thick axial slice taken through the dividing cell . At however , no accumulation was seen , and ultimately , cytokinesis the 1 . 5 min time point , the furrow had invaginated . By 3 . 0 min , the failed . At 10 . 5 min the cleavage furrow had completely regressed . The furrow had almost completed .

However , also Movie 9 in the Supplementary material . one minute after this period the furrow had regressed ( 9 . 0 min ) . The myosin function has also been shown to prevent mem - recently been found to produce cytokinesis defects in HeLa cells [ 56 ] , and this finding suggests that targeting brane resealing and delivery to sites of membrane disrup - tion [ 54 , 55 ] . Inhibition of Rabkinesin 6 / Rab6 - KIFL has pathways are indeed involved in secretion and that these pathways are involved in cytokinesis as well . Figure 6 Kinesins , such as KLP3A [ 57 ] and ZEN - 4 / CeMKLP1 [ 6 , 7 ] , have been found localized to spindle midzone microtu - bules and are also necessary for the completion of cytoki - nesis . The spindle midzone fails to assemble in zen - 4 mutants [ 6 , 7 ] . The RhoGAP CYK - 4 also interacts with ZEN - 4 [ 58 ] , and this finding suggests a cooperative inter - action during the assembly and maintenance of the spin - dle midzone . Future molecular and genetic studies may provide clues to the role of microtubule - based molecular motors and associated regulatory proteins in midzone as - sembly and vesicle targeting during cytokinesis . Recent evidence suggests that the motor molecules that are used in vesicle transport in neurons depend on the distance the vesicles must travel [ 59 , 60 ] . The microtubule network is thought to be used primarily for long - range vesicle transport and to require microtubule - based mo - tors , such as kinesins . The actin network , however , is used for short - range transport and motors such as myosin - Va [ 59 ] . In S . cerevisiae , it is known that vesicles are trans - Targeted exocytosis is required in both plant and animal cytokinesis . ported along actin cables toward the mother - bud neck Plant cytokinesis is depicted on the left and animal cytokinesis on and that this transport requires Myosin Va [ 61 – 63 ] . In the right . The model proposes that vesicles ( circles ) traffic along plants , both the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons are microtubules toward the equatorial plane of the cell in both plant crucial for normal cell division [ 1 , 64 ] . Recent evidence and animal cells . In plants , vesicles are transported along the microtubules of the phragmoplast and ultimately fuse at the of short - range , actin - based vesicle movement has been equatorial plane forming the cell plate between the daughter cells . In observed in Xenopus extracts and suggests that vesicle animal cells , vesicles are transported along the microtubules of the transport may be mediated with the aid of treadmilling residual body of the mitotic apparatus to the midzone , where they fuse actin tails [ 65 ] . Whether these mechanisms are required and seal off the intercellular canal and thus separate the daughter cells . during cytokinesis is unclear . Since actin is locally en - riched in the terminal furrow in animal cells [ 49 , 66 , 67 ] , Research Paper Brefeldin A - sensitive completion of cytokinesis Skop et al . 743 Figure 7 Model for vesicle fusion in sealing off the intercellular canal . The sequence shows events that may occur at the apex of the furrow . Here , progressive vesicle fusion in the vicinity of the persisting intercellular canal forms finger - like projections that fuse with the membrane from the opposite side of the furrow . Cell separation is then complete . it is possible that actin may play a role in localized move - of cytokinesis . INCENPs / ICP - 1 / ICP - 2 [ 68 , 69 ] , ZEN - 4 / CeMKLP1 / CHO1 / pavarotti / [ 6 , 7 , 70 , 71 ] , KLP3A [ 57 ] , ments of vesicles between the midbody and plasma mem - brane during the terminal phase of cytokinesis . the formin gene ( CYK - 1 ) [ 72 ] , the aurora kinase ( AIR - 2 ) [ 8 , 69 ] , and a RhoGAP ( CYK - 4 ) [ 58 ] are all required for the late stages of cytokinesis . Their exact role in the final Membrane accumulation at terminal furrows Membrane accumulates at the intercellular canal after stages of cytokinesis is unclear . Their mutant phenotypes suggest that these proteins are required for the mainte - furrow completion . The increase in membrane labeling seen at the apex of the late cleavage furrow with an extra - nance of the contractile ring , formation of the spindle midzone structure , or both . We suggest that these proteins cellular membrane probe is probably due to extensive , localized plasma membrane ruffling caused by the local are required , not for the actual pinching off of membrane , but for the stabilization of the cytokinetic ring and / or insertion of new membrane . Our observations suggest that this localized accumulation is required for breaking and the maintenance of the structural integrity of the spindle midzone . We propose that these conditions are necessary resealing the intercellular canal during the terminal phase of cytokinesis . It has been observed that blastomeres can - for targeting BFA - sensitive vesicles to the region of the intercellular canal and allow vesicles to fuse into a minia - not be separated until 5 min after cleavage [ 26 ] ; ( A .

Furthermore , we propose that the spindle mid - time required to break and reseal the intercellular canal . We have shown that BFA - treated blastomeres do not ac - zone of animal cells is functionally analogous to the plant cumulate membrane within this time frame and that they phragmoplast along which BFA - sensitive vesicles are suffer cytokinesis failures , and this finding indicates that transported to the equatorial plane , where they fuse to membrane - targeting mechanisms are necessary during form the cell plate . the late stage of cytokinesis in a process similar to that of plants .

The tubulin : : GFP ( WH204 ) strain was cultured at 25 8 C [ 32 ] . the equatorial plane was observed , although membrane fusion events could not be seen because they are beyond optical resolution limits in this system .
