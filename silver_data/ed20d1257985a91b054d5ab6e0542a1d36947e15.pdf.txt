Conclusion SUMMARY : Buruli ulcer ( BU ) is an emerging human disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans , which mainly affects the extremities . It is most endemic in sub - Saharan Africa ; however , it has been reported worldwide , including in some non - tropical areas . ` ` M . ulcerans subsp . shinshuense ' ' is proposed as a subspecies of M . ulcerans , which have been reported from Japan and China . A total of 35 BU cases have been reported as of November 2012 . Although M . ulcerans is categorized as nontuber - culous mycobacteria , it has some unique characteristics that could only be observed in this bacterium . It possesses a giant virulent plasmid , composed of 174 - kbp nucleotides , coding polyketide synthase to produce macrolide toxin called mycolactone . The discovery of such a linkage of plasmid and its patho - genesis has not been reported in other human disease - causing mycobacteria . 1 . Introduction Buruli ulcer ( BU ) is a necrotizing skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans , belonging to nontuber - culous mycobacteria ( NTM ) family . It has a unique characteristic of producing a macrolide toxin called ` ` mycolactone ' ' ( 1 – 5 ) , which has not been identified in any other species of mycobacteria including Mycobac - terium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae . BU has been reported in at least 33 countries , and M . ulcerans disease is probably the third most common mycobac - terial disease after tuberculosis and leprosy in some en - demic areas among immunocompetent individuals ( 6 ) . BU is categorized as a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) . The most endemic areas include sub - Saharan Africa , and a control strategy has been implemented to minimize morbidity and disability associated with BU especially in these areas ( Fig . 1 ) . The mode of transmission remains unclear ; however , it is speculated that an aquatic environmental source is the origin of infection . Similarities in charac - teristics are found in other mycobacterial strains , which mainly infect frogs , fish , or turtles ( 7 – 9 ) , and therefore , they must be differentiated when searching for M . ul - cerans in environmental sources . In this review , the history of researches on M . ulcerans and other mycolac - tone - producing mycobacteria are described , focusing on mycolactone and their virulent plasmids . 2 . Epidemiology and symptoms of BU 2 – 1 . History Historically , BU first gained notice from two foci . One focus was in Central Africa where the first related description was made by Sir Albert Cook . He described several cases of chronic large ulceration in Uganda in 1897 . Later on , the disease was named after Buruli County in Uganda , where the first large epidemic was investigated in the 1960s ( 10 , 11 ) . At present , sub - Saha - ran Africa , especially Cote d ' Ivoire , Ghana , and Benin are the highest endemic countries to be controlled . The other focus is in southeastern Australia . In the first report , there was a series of unusual painless ulcers in a patient from Bairnsdale in 1935 ( 12 ) . Thirteen years af - ter the first report , MacCallum et al . made the first description of the mycobacterial infection in 1948 ( 13 ) . The name M . ulcerans first appeared in a report by Fenner in 1952 ( 14 ) . Currently , Bellarine Peninsula in Victoria is known to be the highest endemic area in Australia ( 15 ) . 84 Fig . 1 .

Symptoms BU often starts as a painless papule or nodule , look - ing like an insect bite . However , it gradually leads to the destruction of skin and ulceration . Interestingly , despite their severity , the lesions are often painless . The ulcer usually presents with a yellow - whitish necrotic base with undermined borders and edematous surroundings . Major affected sites are the extremities and the face . If patients seek treatment during early stages , antibiotics ( rifampicin and streptomycin as recommended by the WHO ) can prove to be successful . Delayed treatment may cause irreversible deformity , long - term functional disabilities such as restriction of joint movement , exten - sive skin lesions , and sometimes life - threatening sec - ondary infections ( 1 – 5 ) . 2 – 3 . BU in Japan The first reported case of BU in Japan was a 19 - year - old woman in 1980 ( 16 ) . The causative agent was isolat - 85 Table 1 .

The photograph was provided by the attending doctor ( Dr . Hideaki Imada ) in the NHO Higashihiroshima Medical Center . 85 ed and classified as ` ` M . ulcerans subsp . shinshuense ' ' because it was closely related to M . ulcerans ( 17 ) . The second reported case was a 37 - year - old woman in 2003 ( 18 ) . After the second report , there has been a steady in - crease , summing up to a total of 35 cases as of Novem - ber 2012 ( 16 – 26 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . Among all cases , 23 ( 65 . 7 z ) subjects were female and 12 ( 34 . 3 z ) were male . The average age of those affected was 39 . 7 years ( range , 2 – 84 years ) for females and 43 . 3 years ( range , 5 – 81 years ) for males . Eleven cases were found in the Chugoku region , 9 in the Chubu region , 7 in the Tohoku region , 6 in the Kinki region , 1 in the Kanto region , and 1 in the Kyushu region ( Fig . 3 ) . Although there was no geographical focus in the distribution , 3 out of 4 cases in Fukushima Prefecture ( Tohoku region ) were family members . The highest number of cases ( 9 cases ) was found in Okayama Prefecture ( Chugoku region ) . There has also been one report from China of which M . ulcerans subsp . shinshuense was isolated from an ulcer ( 27 ) . Hence , M . ulcerans subsp . shinshuense is now speculated to be an endemic species of M . ulcerans in east Asia ( 28 , 29 ) . This subspecies has been isolated or at least confirmed through direct nucleotide sequencing in the identified cases . The characteristics of BU in Japan are shown in Table 1 . Though there seem to be some differences in clinical presentation such as more painful cases in Japanese cases ( Fig . 4 ) , histopathologi - cal findings do not differ from those of other parts of the world . Unlike other mycobacterial infections , the histopathology of BU presents with poor formation of granulation tissue and little inflammatory cell infiltra - tion surrounding the ulcerative lesion . Although there is extensive necrosis , the circumjacent epidermis is usually unaffected , and the lesions are usually deeper in the sub - cutaneous areas . Acid - fast bacilli are often evident on the lower dermis . 3 . Mycolactone and mycolactone - producing mycobacteria 3 – 1 . Isolation of mycolactone From the very beginning , pathologists were certain that some toxic substances from M . ulcerans relate to the unique characteristic of the skin lesions in BU be - cause histopathological changes were observed distant from where massive acid - fast bacilli were detected ( 30 – 32 ) . In 1999 , mycolactone was isolated as the cause of cytopathicity and cell - cycle arrest in cultured L929 murine fibroblasts ( 33 ) . Guinea pigs produced lesions similar to those of BU in humans following purified mycolactone injection ( 34 ) . Mycolactone is not a pro - tein but a smaller molecule , which is composed of a 12 - membered ring ( macrolide ) to which two polyketide - derived side chains are attached . It structurally resem - bles immuno - suppressants such as rapamycin , FK506 , and cyclosporin A . The characteristic mixture of mycolactone congeners varies in clinical isolates from geographically different areas ( 35 ) . The structure that 86 Fig . 5 . Basic structure of mycolactone and complete structure of mycolactone A / B . Boxed site indicates isomers A ( cis ) and B ( trans ) ( 33 , 36 ) . 86 has the highest activity in mammalian cell lines is mycolactone A / B , which exists as a 3 : 2 equilibrating mixture ; the major and minor components are Z - D 4 ? , 5 ? - and E - D 4 ? , 5 ? - isomers , respectively , on the unsaturated fatty acid side chain ( 36 ) ( Fig . 5 ) . 3 – 2 . Discovery of mycolactone synthetase bearing plasmid pMUM001 Attempts to identify genetic bases of the virulent fac - tor in M . ulcerans started by comparing closely related mycobacterial strain Mycobacterium marinum ( 37 ) . This idea of subtraction was thought of because these two strains were genetically related species but M . marinum produced no mycolactone . A type I polyketide synthase ( pks ) gene fragment was identified as an M . ulcerans specific gene based on genomic suppressive subtractive hybridization between M . ulcerans and M . marinum ( 38 ) . In 2004 , a giant plasmid , which bears mycolactone - producing enzymes , was identified using pks probes identified through subtractive hybridization . These probes were hybridized using pulsed - field gel electrophoresed DNA or a BAC library of the M . ul - cerans Ghana isolate Agy99 . The plasmid pMUM001 is composed of 174 , 155 bp , as a 62 . 8 z GC content , and its 81 protein - coding DNA sequences bears a cluster of genes for complete mycolactone synthesis ( 39 , 40 ) . The discovery of pMUM001 had profound implications for mycobacterial research because mycobacterial plasmids have never been directly linked to virulence . Moreover , the M . tuberculosis complex , the most virulent mycobacterium for humans , is reported to have no plasmids . 3 – 3 . Role of mycolactone The role of mycolactone in M . ulcerans survival in na - ture is not clarified . On the other hand , during infection of humans , which causes BUs , the function of mycolac - tone is thought to cause ` ` painless lesions ' ' and ` ` poor acute inflammatory cellular infiltration . ' ' Although its mechanisms have not yet been revealed , painless lesions were successfully demonstrated by M . ulcerans infection and / or purified mycolactone injection in mice . Nerve degeneration occurs through invasion of bacilli or mycolactone at the perineural and endoneurial level , in - ducing loss of pain sensation or hypoesthesia ( 41 , 42 ) . Mycolactone effectively suppresses the capacity of den - dritic cells to secrete b - chemokines macrophage inflam - matory protein ( MIP ) - 1 a , MIP - 1 b , regulated on activa - tion , normal T cell expressed and secreted , as well as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interferon g - inducible protein 10 , which may limit initiation of pri - mary immune responses . Moreover , it inhibits the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the infection site ( 43 ) . 3 – 4 . Other mycolactone - producing mycobacteria In 2001 , there was an outbreak of a new granuloma - forming disease in a laboratory , which killed a number of experimental frogs ( Xenopus tropicalis ) . Granulomas were identified systemically on the skin as well as in other areas ; the causative agent was later identified as Mycobacterium liflandii ( 44 ) . It formed orange - pig - mented colonies after long cultivation , possessed giant plasmid pMUM002 similar to pMUM001 , and had IS 2404 and IS 2606 like M . ulcerans . The product of pMUM002 has now been identified as mycolactone E ( 7 ) . M . liflandii was initially thought to be the causative pathogen for BU ; however , it is now known that it in - fects mainly frogs ( 45 ) . Some M . marinum strains isolated from fish are known to be Mycobacterium pseudoshottsii , which have IS 2404 , IS 2606 , and pMUM003 ( similar to plasmid pMUM001 ) , and produce mycolactone F ( 8 ) . M . pseu - doshottsii has been isolated in Japan , especially from various types of farm - raised fish such as yellow tail ( Seriola quinqueradiata ) , greater amberjack ( Seriola dumerili ) , sevenband grouper ( Epinephelus septemfas - ciatus ) , striped jack ( Pseudocaranx dentex ) , and yellow - tail amberjack ( Seriola lalandi ) ( 46 ) . M . pseudoshottsii were isolated from the kidney of the fish that were lethally affected . The genomes of some of these mycolactone - producing mycobacteria were analyzed , and interestingly , it is now evident that these species are very closely related in their evolution . What is more striking , differences in the genome sequencing of the plasmids for pMUM001 , pMUM002 , and pMUM003 correspond to differences in the structures of the un - saturated fatty acid side chains for each type of mycolactone , namely , A / B , E , and F ( 47 , 48 ) . 4 . Conclusion Some researchers have reported that mycobacterial strains that have pMUM001 - like plasmids and produce mycolactone should be considered a single species ( 49 ) . This conclusion emerged from a number of genomic studies . Nonetheless , infection of these mycobacteria in fish or frogs , especially in places with high risk of infec - tion such as fish farms , is causing a considerable anxiety in people . Therefore , there is a need to understand the possibility of infection from animals to humans , a need for invention of easy diagnostic tools , and a need to raise awareness among people about the mycobacteria 8787 with the right information .
