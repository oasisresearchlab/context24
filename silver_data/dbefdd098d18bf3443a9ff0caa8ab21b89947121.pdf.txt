THOMAS PARSONS * Department of Microbiology , Health Sciences Center , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , Virginia 22908 Received 4 December 1995 / Returned for modiﬁcation 21 January 1996 / Accepted 28 March 1996 The integrin family of cell surface receptors mediates cell adhesion to components of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . Integrin engagement with the ECM initiates signaling cascades that regulate the organization of the actin - cytoskeleton and changes in gene expression . The Rho subfamily of Ras - related low - molecular - weight GTP - binding proteins and several protein tyrosine kinases have been implicated in mediating various aspects of integrin - dependent alterations in cell homeostasis . Focal adhesion kinase ( FAK or pp125 FAK ) is one of the tyrosine kinases predicted to be a critical component of integrin signaling . To elucidate the mechanisms by which FAK participates in integrin - mediated signaling , we have used expression cloning to identify cDNAs that encode potential FAK - binding proteins . We report here the identiﬁcation of a cDNA that encodes a new member of the GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) family of GTPase regulators . This GAP , termed Graf ( for GTPase regulator associated with FAK ) , binds to the C - terminal domain of FAK in an SH3 domain - dependent manner and preferentially stimulates the GTPase activity of the GTP - binding proteins RhoA and Cdc42 . Subcellular localization studies using Graf - transfected chicken embryo cells indicates that Graf colocalizes with actin stress ﬁbers , cortical actin structures , and focal adhesions . Graf mRNA is expressed in a variety of avian tissues and is particularly abundant in embryonic brain and liver . Graf represents the ﬁrst example of a regulator of the Rho family of small GTP - binding proteins that exhibits binding to a protein tyrosine kinase . We suggest that Graf may function to mediate cross talk between the tyrosine kinases such as FAK and the Rho family GTPases that control steps in integrin - initiated signaling events . Integrin - mediated cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) has both structural and biochemical ramiﬁcations for cell homeostasis ( 31 ) . Integrins bind components of the ECM via large extracellular domains . These sites of integrin - ECM interaction trigger the formation of protein complexes on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane termed focal adhe - sions . Focal adhesions contain several proteins with the capac - ity to simultaneously bind the short cytoplasmic tails of inte - grins and actin ﬁlaments . Thus , focal adhesions serve to anchor the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane and directly link the extracellular and intracellular environments ( 10 ) . Be - sides playing a structural role , the binding of integrins to ECM results in the initiation of intracellular signaling cascades ( 17 , 49 ) . Activation of these cascades has been proposed to regu - late gene expression ( 22 , 66 ) , cell survival ( 8 , 54 ) , cell migra - tion and adhesion , and differentiation ( 31 ) . Recent studies have generated an extensive list of potential mediators of in - tegrin signaling , including the cytoplasmic protein kinases focal adhesion kinase ( pp125 FAK or FAK ) ( 55 ) , pp60 src ( 18 , 35 , 55 ) , pp59 fyn ( 18 ) , C - terminal Src kinase ( Csk ) ( 4 ) , and protein ki - nase C isoforms (cid:97) and (cid:100) ( 2 , 32 ) ; the adaptor molecules Crk and Grb2 ( 5 , 61 ) ; the p21 Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors C3G and Sos ( 61 , 65 ) ; and phosphoinositol 3 - kinase ( PI 3 - K ) ( 15 , 24 ) . FAK has been predicted to play a critical role in initiating cytoplasmic signals from focal adhesions ( 49 , 59 ) . Following cell adhesion to ECM components , FAK displays increases in both phosphotyrosine ( pTyr ) content and FAK - associated tyrosine kinase activity ( 23 , 26 , 40 , 56 ) . Phosphory - lation of FAK on Tyr 397 creates a high - afﬁnity binding site for the Src homology 2 ( SH2 ) domains of Src family kinases Src and Fyn ( 18 , 57 ) . The binding of activated Src family kinases to FAK leads to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK ( 12 ) and other focal adhesion proteins , including paxillin ( 11 ) , ten - sin ( 6 ) , and p130 CAS ( 26a ) . When tyrosine phosphorylated , these proteins may serve to recruit SH2 domain - containing signaling molecules such as Grb2 , Crk , and PI 3 - K p85 subunit to focal adhesions ( 5 , 12 , 15 , 60 , 61 ) . FAK exhibits a unique domain structure , possessing a cen - trally located catalytic domain ﬂanked by N - and C - terminal domains of 415 and 378 amino acid residues , respectively , that appear to serve as binding sites for potential regulators , effec - tors , and activators of FAK . In vitro , the N - terminal domain of FAK directly binds peptides that mimic the cytoplasmic do - mains of (cid:98) 1 , (cid:98) 2 , and (cid:98) 3 integrins ( 58 ) , while in vivo , the N - terminal domain also binds SH2 domains of Src family kinases ( 18 , 57 ) . Similarly , the C - terminal domain has been shown to bind the focal adhesion proteins paxillin ( 28 ) , p130 CAS ( 26a ) , and talin ( 14 ) , as well as the adaptor molecules Grb2 ( 61 ) and the p85 subunit of PI 3 - kinase ( 15 , 24 ) . Finally , C - terminal residues 904 - 1041 of FAK contain a focal adhesion targeting ( FAT ) sequence , a domain that is both necessary and sufﬁcient for focal adhesion localization ( 27 ) . Although the paxillin bind - ing site extensively overlaps the FAT sequence , the FAK - pax - illin interaction does not appear to be sufﬁcient to mediate efﬁcient localization of FAK to focal contacts ( 28 ) . Integrin - mediated formation of focal adhesions and phos - phorylation of FAK are largely dependent on the ability of a cell to form an intact cytoskeleton . Perhaps the most signiﬁcant regulators of actin cytoskeleton are the small GTP - binding proteins of the Rho subfamily ( 25 ) . In ﬁbroblasts , it has been shown that Rho family members Cdc42 , Rac1 , and RhoA * Corresponding author .

Furthermore , these three GTPases function in a cascade , such that activation of Cdc42 leads to activation of Rac1 , which in turn activates Rho ( 35 , 43 ) . The observed effects of Rho on the cytoskeletal organization may be mediated in part by PIP 2 . Activation of Rho leads to an increase in phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( 4 , 5 - PIP 2 ) ( 16 ) , which has been shown to regulate several actin - binding proteins ( 21 , 33 , 39 , 67 ) . Re - cently , these GTPases have also been implicated in regulating kinase cascades and gene expression , as activated Rac1 and Cdc42 stimulate c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) / stress - acti - vated protein kinase ( SAPK ) ( 20 , 44 ) , and activated Rac1 , RhoA , and Cdc42Hs stimulate serum - response factor ( SRF ) ( 29 ) . Similarly , GTP - bound forms of Rac1 and Cdc42 have been shown to bind and activate the cytoplasmic protein ki - nases p65 PAK and p120 ACK , further linking this family of GTPases to kinase cascades ( 42 , 43 ) . Rho family GTPases also play a role in regulating growth control . Activated mutants of Rho GTPases and activators of Rho GTPases can mediate cellular transformation . Furthermore , Rac has been shown to mediate aspects of Ras - induced transformation ( 46 ) . Finally , it is well documented that the ability of Rho family GTPases to participate in signaling events is determined by their nucleo - tide - bound state and subcellular localization ( 7 ) . The cycling of GTPases between active GTP - bound states and inactive GDP - bound states is regulated by numerous GTPase - activating pro - teins ( GAPs ) , guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) , and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors ( GDIs ) ( 25 ) . We have used an expression cloning technique to identify binding partners for the C - terminal domain of FAK . We report here the identiﬁcation of a cDNA that encodes a FAK - binding protein . The predicted amino acid sequence of this cDNA revealed two homology domains : a centrally located GAP do - main and a distally located SH3 domain . In vitro analysis indicates that the protein encoded by this cDNA is a functional GAP for Cdc42 and RhoA and the SH3 domain binds to a proline - containing amino acid sequence in FAK . We refer to this molecule as Graf ( GTPase regulator associated with FAK ) . Graf mRNA is expressed in a variety of avian tissues and is relatively abundant in brain and liver . Exogenous ex - pression of the Graf cDNA in chicken embryo ( CE ) cells re - vealed that Graf can associate with actin - based cytoskeletal structures and may play a role in organizing cytoskeletal archi - tecture . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells and viruses . CE cells were prepared and maintained as described pre - viously ( 9 ) . For expression of Graf and FAK in CE cells , cDNAs encoding these proteins were cloned into RCAS retroviral vectors ( subgroup A for FAK expres - sion or subgroup B for Graf expression ) ( 27 , 28 , 30 ) and transfected into primary CE cells by the calcium phosphate method ( 9 , 48 ) . Following transfection , cells were passaged for 7 to 9 days to allow for viral propagation and infection of the cell population . Typically , by day 5 posttransfection , transfected cell populations were resistant to superinfection by a virus of the same subgroup , indicating efﬁcient transfection and virus propagation . Screening of cDNA libraries . A (cid:108) gt11 cDNA library derived from CE mRNA ( Clontech , Palo Alto , Calif . ) was screened by using a GST - FAK fusion protein , GST - Cterm ( consisting of amino acid residues 686 to 1053 of avian FAK ) that had been labeled in vitro with 32 P ( 28 ) . Generation of 32 P - labeled GST - FAK was as follows . GST - Cterm was expressed in Escherichia coli , afﬁnity puriﬁed by using glutathione - Sepharose , and phosphorylated in vitro using cyclic AMP - dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit ( PKA , Sigma , St . Louis , Mo . ) as described ( 28 , 34 ) . Brieﬂy , GST - Cterm fusion protein ( approximately 3 (cid:109) g ) coupled to gluta - thione - Sepharose was washed in heart muscle kinase ( HMK ) buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 100 mM NaCl , 12 mM MgCl 2 ) , resuspended in 50 (cid:109) l of HMK buffer containing 50 U of PKA , 100 (cid:109) Ci of [ (cid:103) - 32 P ] ATP ( 6 , 000 Ci / mmol ; Dupont NEN , Wilmington , Del . ) and 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , and incubated for 45 min at room temperature ( RT ) . Beads were subsequently washed once with 1 ml of HMK stop buffer ( 10 mM sodium phosphate [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 10 mM sodium pyro - phosphate , 10 mM EDTA ) and ﬁve times with 1 ml of Tris - buffered saline ( TBS ) ( 10 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 150 mM NaCl ) . GST - Cterm was eluted twice at RT with constant rotation in 10 bed volumes of glutathione solution ( 20 mM reduced glutathione , 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 120 mM NaCl ) . Screening of (cid:108) gt11 expression libraries has been previously described ( 34 , 64 ) . Brieﬂy , approximately 10 6 PFU were plated on 20 150 - mm plates and grown for 4 h at 37 (cid:56) C . Plates were covered with nitrocellulose ﬁlters ( B85 ; Schleicher & Schuell ) that had been soaked in isopropyl - (cid:98) - D - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) and returned to 37 (cid:56) C for an additional 8 h of growth . Filters were removed , denatured and renatured , and blocked in hybridization solution as follows . For denaturation and renaturation , ﬁlters were incubated twice for 5 min in 100 ml of Hyb75 ( 20 mM HEPES [ N - 2 - hydroxyethylpiperazine - N (cid:57) - 2 - ethanesulfonic acid ] [ pH 7 . 7 ] , 75 mM KCl , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 2 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 05 % Nonidet P - 40 ) ( 34 ) supplemented with guanidine hydrochloride ( GuHCl ) to a ﬁnal concentration of 6 M . The ﬁlters were then washed four times for 10 min per wash in 100 ml of Hyb75 containing 3 M GuHCl ( a 1 : 1 dilution of the 6 M GuHCl solution ) . This step was repeated four times , each time using Hyb75 containing a twofold dilution of the GuHCl from the previous wash step . Filters were transferred to new dishes and washed twice for 30 min in 100 ml of Hyb75 . Filters were then blocked for 30 min in 50 to 75 ml of Hyb75 plus 5 % milk and then 30 min in 50 to 75 ml of hybridization solution plus 5 % milk . Hybridization solution was generated as described previously ( 34 ) . Brieﬂy , DH5 E . coli cells harboring the parental pGex2TK vector were induced to express GST with IPTG ( 0 . 1 mM ﬁnal concentration ) for 2 h at 37 (cid:56) C . Following induction , bacteria were pelleted , resuspended in 1 / 20 the original volume in Hyb75 , and lysed on ice by sonication . Lysates were clariﬁed by centrifugation at 12 , 000 (cid:51) g for 15 min at 4 (cid:56) C . Hybridization buffer was stored at (cid:50) 20 (cid:56) C and diluted 1 : 5 prior to use . Following blocking , 32 P - labeled fusion protein was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 6 cpm / ml of hybridization buffer . Filters were hybridized for 12 h at 4 (cid:56) C . Following hybridization , ﬁlters were washed three times for 15 min per wash at RT in 100 ml of Hyb75 plus 1 % milk . Filters were then exposed to ﬁlm for 12 h at (cid:50) 70 (cid:56) C with an intensifying screen . Positive clones were puriﬁed by successive rounds of plaque puriﬁcation . cDNA inserts were cloned into pBluescript ( Strat - agene , La Jolla , Calif . ) and sequenced on both strands by dideoxy sequencing . Genetics Computer Group sequence analysis software was used to analyze DNA and amino acid sequences . Mutagenesis , epitope - tagged Graf , and fusion proteins . For expression of GST - GrafSH3 , clone 11A cDNA sequences ( see Fig . 1 ) encoding the C - terminal 113 amino acid residues ( 471 to 584 ) were cloned into pGex3X . Vectors encod - ing GST - AblSH3 , and GST - Grb2 , GST - ScrSH3 , and GST - CasSH3 were gener - ously provided by A . M . Pendergast , A . Pawson , J . Brugge , and A . H . Bouton , respectively . pGex2TK - cterm encodes the fusion protein GST - Cterm and was constructed by cloning FAK sequences that encode amino acid residues 686 to 1053 into pGex2TK . GST - GrafGAP was engineered by cloning 11A cDNA sequences that encode residues 171 to 404 into pGex3X . Mutations resulting in FAK point mutants pmP878A and pmP881A were generated in the FAK cDNA by site - directed mutagenesis ( Altered Sites ; Promega , Madison , Wis . ) and con - ﬁrmed by dideoxy sequencing . FAK sequences encoding the proline to alanine mutants were cloned into pGex2TK - Cterm for in vitro expression and evalua - tion . The cDNA construct encoding the C - terminal epitope - tagged variant of Graf , cGraf , was generated as follows . The coding region of clone 11A was ampliﬁed by PCR using primers that generated 5 (cid:57) Nhe I and 3 (cid:57) Cla I restriction sites . The resulting PCR product was digested with Nhe I and Cla I and ligated into Xba I / Cla I - digested pBSctag ( 27 , 28 , 56 ) to generate pBS Graf - ctag . To facilitate clon - ing of Graf - ctag into RCAS B , Graf - ctag was cloned into the Cla12Nco adaptor plasmid ( 30 ) . pBS Graf - ctag was digested with Nco I and Sal I and ligated into similarly digested Cla12Nco . The Nco I - Sal I fragment derived from Graf - ctag encodes Graf amino acid residues 92 to 584 fused in frame to the 11 - amino - acid epitope tag consisting of the amino acid sequence KPPTPPPEPET . The Graf - ctag expression cassette was subsequently cloned from Cla12Nco into RCAS B as a Cla I fragment . The Nco I sites of clone 11A and Cla12Nco provide a eukaryotic initiation codon for expression in CE cells ( 30 , 36 ) . In vitro association . For in vitro binding experiments , approximately 5 (cid:109) g of GST , GST - AblSH3 , GST - CasSH3 , GST - Grb2 , GST - SrcSH3 , GST - GrafSH3 , GST - Cterm , GST - CtermP878A , or GST - CtermP881A was added to either 1 . 0 mg of total cell protein ( concentration of 1 . 0 mg / ml ) derived from normal CE cells or 500 (cid:109) g of total cell protein ( concentration of 0 . 5 mg / ml ) derived from CE cells expressing cGraf that had been lysed in radio immunoprecipitation assay buffer ( RIPA ) . Protein complexes were washed three times with RIPA and twice with TBS , resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) ( 38 ) , and transferred to nitrocellulose . FAK and cGraf were de - tected by immunoblotting using the FAK - speciﬁc monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) 2A7 ( 55 ) or the epitope tag - speciﬁc MAb KT3 ( which recognizes the peptide KPPTPPPEPET ) at a concentration of 2 . 5 (cid:109) g / ml ( 28 , 41 ) . GTPase activation assays . RhoA , Rac1 , Cdc42 ( gifts from Alan Hall ) , Ras ( a gift from Michael Weber ) , and the Graf GAP domain were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E . coli and puriﬁed by protease cleavage as described previ - ously ( 50 , 52 ) . First , 40 ng of puriﬁed RhoA , Rac1 , Cdc42 , and Ras were loaded with 15 (cid:109) Ci of [ (cid:103) - 32 P ] GTP ( 6 , 000 Ci / mmol ; Dupont NEN ) in loading buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 50 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 1 mg of bovine serum 3170 HILDEBRAND ET AL . M OL . C ELL . B IOL . albumin [ BSA ] per ml , 1 mM DTT ) for 15 min at RT in a total volume of 30 (cid:109) l . MgCl 2 was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 mM , and the GTPase mixture was placed on ice . Then , 5 (cid:109) l of each loaded GTPase was diluted to a ﬁnal concentration of 5 nM in GTPase buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mg of BSA per ml , 1 mM DTT ) in the presence or absence of 1 , 5 , 10 , or 20 nM Graf GAP domain and incubated for 15 min at RT . Following incu - bation , 1 ml of wash buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT ) was added and the mixture was ﬁltered through nitrocellulose membranes ( B85 ; Schleicher & Schuell ) . Membranes were washed with 10 ml of wash buffer , air dried , and counted to determine the amount of [ (cid:103) - 32 P ] GTP remaining ( 63 ) . For analysis of in vivo - expressed Graf , cGraf was immunoprecipitated from 500 (cid:109) g of total cell protein ( concentration of 0 . 5 mg / ml ) in RIPA using MAb KT3 at a concentration of 10 (cid:109) g / mg of cellular protein . Immune complexes were washed three times with RIPA , once with TBS , and once with GAP buffer and resus - pended in 100 (cid:109) l of GAP buffer . GTPases preloaded with [ (cid:103) - 32 P ] GTP were added to a ﬁnal concentration of 5 nM , and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at RT with constant rotation . Following incubation , 1 ml of wash buffer was added . The immune complexes were pelleted , and the supernatants were re - moved and ﬁltered as described above . Filters were washed and counted as described above . Before the immune complexes were washed in GAP buffer , one - ﬁfth of each immunoprecipitate was removed and subjected to immunoblot analysis using MAb KT3 . Immunoﬂuorescence . CE cells expressing cGraf alone or coexpressing FAK and cGraf were plated on glass cover slides and grown overnight . Cells were washed three times with calcium - and magnesium - free phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and ﬁxed using 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at RT . Cells were washed three times in PBS and permeabilized with 0 . 4 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 3 min at RT . Slides were washed three times in PBS to remove Triton . For simultaneous detection of cGraf and actin , cells were incubated with MAb KT3 at a concentration of 10 (cid:109) g / ml in PBS and TRITC - phalloidin ( for detection of actin ) ( Sigma , St . Louis , Mo . ) ( 1 : 5 , 000 dilution in PBS ) for 1 h at RT . Slides were washed three times in PBS to remove excess antibody . Primary antibody was detected by using ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate - conjugated goat anti - mouse Ab ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , West Grove , Pa . ) at a concentration of 5 (cid:109) g / ml for 1 h at RT . For costaining of FAK and cGraf , cells were incubated with a mixture of MAb KT3 ( 10 (cid:109) g / ml in PBS ) and protein A - puriﬁed FAK - speciﬁc polyclonal antibody BC3 ( 1 : 400 dilution in PBS ) ( 55 ) for 1 h at RT . Primary antibodies were detected with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate - conjugated goat anti - mouse Ab and Texas red - conjugated donkey anti - rabbit Ab ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , West Grove , Pa . ) . Coverslips were washed in PBS and mounted on microscope slides for observation and photography . Northern ( RNA ) blot analysis . RNA was isolated from 17 - day CE tissues by phenol - chloroform extraction using RNAzol ( Tel - Test , Friendswood , Tex . ) and poly ( A ) - containing RNA was selected by using oligo ( dT ) - Sepharose ( Qiagen , Chatsworth , Calif . ) . The GRAF cDNA probe ( bp 285 to 1804 ) was radiolabeled with [ (cid:97) - 32 P ] CTP by nick translation using random primers . The probe ( 5 (cid:51) 10 8 cpm / (cid:109) g ) was hybridized with poly ( A ) - RNA - containing ﬁlters overnight at 42 (cid:56) C and washed twice ( 15 min ) in 0 . 2 (cid:51) SSC – 0 . 1 % SDS at 42 (cid:56) C and twice ( 15 min ) in 0 . 1 (cid:51) SSC – 0 . 1 % SDS at 68 (cid:56) C ( 1 (cid:51) SSC is 0 . 15 M NaCl plus 0 . 015 M sodium citrate ) . Autoradiograms were obtained by exposure of blots to Kodak XAR ﬁlm for 18 to 72 h . Nucleotide sequence accession number . The DNA sequence of clone 11A has been deposited in GenBank under accession no . U36309 . RESULTS Cloning of FAK binding proteins . We have previously de - scribed a C - terminal domain of FAK that is both necessary and sufﬁcient for focal adhesion localization ( 27 ) . In an effort to identify proteins that bind either the FAT sequence or other regions of the FAK C terminus , we used the entire C - terminal domain of FAK ( amino acid residues 686 to 1053 ) to screen a (cid:108) gt11 expression library derived from CE cDNA as described in Materials and Methods . Of the 10 6 PFU screened , one clone ( clone 11A ) was positively identiﬁed and puriﬁed . The trans - lated amino acid sequence of clone 11A predicted a 584 - ami - no - acid open reading frame contiguous with (cid:98) - galactosidase encoded by the phage vector ( Fig . 1A ) . Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence indicated that 11A encoded a novel SH3 domain - containing regulator of Ras - related low - molecular - weight GTP - binding proteins . Centrally located residues 213 to 363 showed extensive homology to GAPs for members of the Rho family of GTPases ( Fig . 1B ) , showing highest homology to (cid:98) - chimaerin . C - terminal amino acid residues 533 to 582 shared homology with SH3 domains of several proteins ( Fig . 1C ) . On the basis of the limited degree of amino acid sequence similarity , this cDNA does not appear to encode the chicken homolog of a previously identiﬁed GAP or SH3 domain - containing protein . Finally , amino acid residues 396 through 527 comprise a proline / serine - rich motif in which the proline and serine content is approximately 43 % . We refer to the protein encoded by this cDNA as Graf , for GTPase regulator associated with FAK . Analysis of Graf mRNA expression . To determine the tissue distribution of Graf mRNA expression , poly ( A ) - containing RNA was prepared from individual tissues from 17 - day CEs . Northern blot analysis using a probe directed to the GAP domain revealed a major 5 . 0 - kb RNA species in most tissues ( Fig . 2B ) . The 5 . 0 - kb RNA species was most abundant in brain and liver ( Fig . 2B ) . On the basis of the size of the major RNA species detected by Northern blot analysis and the total length of overlapping cDNAs isolated to date ( approximately 3 . 0 to 3 . 2 kb ) , there remains approximately 1 . 8 to 2 . 0 kb of uniden - tiﬁed 5 (cid:57) and 3 (cid:57) sequence . Graf is GAP for RhoA and Cdc42 . Sequence analysis indi - cated that Graf should function as a GAP for members of the Rho subfamily of small GTP - binding proteins . To assess the GAP activity of Graf , a portion of Graf containing the GAP domain ( residues 171 to 404 ) was expressed as a GST fusion protein , and the GST fusion protein was assayed for the ability to activate the intrinsic GTPase activity of GTP - bound Rac1 , Cdc42 , and RhoA . As shown in Fig . 3A , the Graf GAP domain was able to stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of RhoA and Cdc42 but not that of Rac1 or Ras ( data not shown ) . In a parallel analysis , the GAP domain of p190 stimulated the GTPase activity of RhoA , Cdc42 , and Rac1 , showing highest activity towards Rho ( 16 - fold activation of Rho GTPase activ - ity ; data not shown ) in agreement with previously published data ( 63 ) . These results indicate that Cdc42 and RhoA may be the preferred substrates for Graf . To assess the GAP activity of Graf expressed in vivo , Graf was expressed in CE cells and assayed for activity towards RhoA , Rac1 , Cdc42 , and Ras ( Fig . 3B ) . An epitope - tagged variant of Graf , cGraf was expressed in CE cells and immuno - precipitated by using the epitope - speciﬁc MAb KT3 . One - ﬁfth of each immunoprecipitate was removed and analyzed by im - munoblotting to verify that equal amounts of cGraf were pres - ent in each experimental sample and that no cGraf was present in the negative control samples ( inset , Fig . 3B ) . The remainder of each immunoprecipitate was then assayed for GAP activity . Figure 3B ( inset ) shows that comparable amounts of cGraf were recovered in each KT3 precipitation ( (cid:49) lanes ) used in the GAP assay , while there was no detectable cGraf in the control precipitations ( (cid:50) lanes ) . Immune complexes containing cGraf exhibited a six - to sevenfold increase in GAP activity towards Cdc42 and RhoA compared to immune complexes isolated from nontransfected cells . Immune complexes from cGraf - transfected cells showed little GAP activity with GTP - Rac or Ras . These results conﬁrm the activity of Graf towards Rho and Cdc42 and suggest that the activity towards Rho and Cdc42 in vivo may be comparable . Considering that the Graf GAP domain exhibited highest sequence similarity to (cid:97) - and (cid:98) - chimaerins , GAPs that function exclusively on Rac GTPases ( 1 ) , the lack of RacGAP activity associated with Graf was surprising . The SH3 domain of Graf mediates binding to FAK in vitro . The experimental approach used to identify clone 11A indi - cated an interaction of Graf with the C - terminal domain of FAK . Since SH3 domains have been shown to mediate protein - protein interactions ( 19 ) we assayed the ability of the Graf SH3 domain to bind FAK in vitro . Portions ( 5 (cid:109) g ) of GST , GST - GrafSH3 , GST - AblSH3 , GST - SrcSH3 , GST - CasSH3 , or GST - V OL . 16 , 1996 Graf , AN SH3 DOMAIN - CONTAINING RhoGAP 3171 Grb2 fusion proteins coupled to glutathione - Sepharose were mixed individually with 1 mg of total cell protein ( concentra - tion of 1 . 0 mg / ml in RIPA ) derived from CE cells . The GST complexes were recovered and assayed for the amount of bound FAK by immunoblotting the precipitated protein com - plexes with MAb 2A7 . As shown in Fig . 4 , the Graf SH3 fusion protein precipitated approximately 20 % of the total FAK present in the lysate ( compare lanes 1 and 3 ; lane 1 represents FIG . 1 .

B IOL . the total amount of immunoreactive FAK in 100 (cid:109) g of lysate ) . Conversely , GST ( lane 2 ) , AblSH3 ( lane 4 ) , and SrcSH3 ( lane 5 ) bound no detectable FAK . The SH3 domain of p130 CAS efﬁciently bound FAK in the lysate ( lane 6 ) , whereas the Grb2 fusion protein bound approximately 0 . 5 to 1 % of the FAK in the lysate ( lane 7 ) . Since the GST - Grb2 fusion protein contains an SH2 domain as well as two SH3 domains , it is unclear that the observed interaction is mediated solely by the Grb2 SH3 domains . The C terminus of FAK contains two proline - rich regions that may function as ligands for SH3 domains . The ﬁrst pro - line - rich motif spans residues 712 to 721 and includes the se - quence P 712 PRPSRPGYP . This proline - rich sequence of FAK was dispensable for the Graf - FAK interaction , as a GST - FAK fusion protein consisting of residues 721 to 941 bound the GrafSH3 fusion protein in a far Western blot and bound cGraf in solution ( data not shown ) . The second proline motif spans residue 875 to 884 and contains the sequence P 875 KKPPR PGAP . To ascertain the role of this proline - rich sequence in FAK - Graf interactions , FAK cDNA sequences encoding the proline motif PKKPPRPGAP were mutated to encode either PKKA 878 PRPGAP or PKKPPRA 881 GAP and cloned into pGex2TK - Cterm . The resulting Cterm mutants , CtermP878A and CtermP881A , were expressed in E . coli and assayed for the ability to bind cGraf expressed in CE cells . As shown in Fig . 5B , Cterm ( lane 4 ) and CtermP881A ( lane 6 ) efﬁciently bound to cGraf . In contrast , CtermP878A showed substantially re - duced binding ( lane 5 ) . As expected , GST alone showed no binding to cGraf ( lane 2 ) , and no KT3 - reactive proteins were precipitated by Cterm in mock - transfected CE lysate ( lane 3 ) . These data indicate that the proline - containing sequence P 875 KKPPR is sufﬁcient for Graf binding to FAK , with Pro 878 being an essential residue in the Graf SH3 ligand . Of interest in these experiments is the observation that CtermP881A re - producibly bound more cGraf than wild - type Cterm ( compare lanes 4 and 6 ) . The sequences encompassing amino acid resi - dues 875 to 884 contain three overlapping PXXP motifs , the core sequence required for SH3 binding . Two of these are eliminated by the P881A mutation . Therefore , it is possible that normally other proteins in the cell lysate compete with Graf for binding to the 875 to 884 proline - rich sequence and that the P881A mutation relieves this competition . Support for this hypothesis comes from the observation of Guinebault et al . that the SH3 domain of the p85 subunit of PI 3 - K binds to this proline - rich region in human FAK ( 24 ) . Subcellular localization of Graf . To investigate the potential role of Graf in vivo , an epitope - tagged variant of Graf was generated and expressed in CE cells . CE cells expressing cGraf were grown overnight on glass cover slides and stained by using MAb KT3 . As shown in Fig . 6A and B , some cells overexpress - ing Graf displayed a diffuse cytoplasmic staining . However , a signiﬁcant portion of the Graf staining was localized to the FIG . 2 . Northern blot analysis of Graf mRNA . Poly ( A ) - containing RNA ( 2 (cid:109) g ) , prepared from individual tissues of a 17 - day - old embryo , were subjected to Northern blot analysis using an approximately 1 . 5 - kb Graf - speciﬁc cDNA probe ( nucleotides 285 to 1804 ) . Panel A shows the analysis of RNAs prepared from liver ( Li ) and brain ( B ) ; panel B shows the analysis of RNAs prepared from eye ( E ) , brain ( B ) , lung ( Lu ) , liver ( Li ) , intestine ( I ) , or skeletal muscle ( M ) . The blot in panel B is overexposed to reveal the presence of low levels of Graf RNA in eye , heart , lung , intestine , and skeletal muscle . The positions of 28S ( 4 . 8 kb ) and 18S ( 1 . 8 kb ) RNAs are indicated . FIG . 3 . GAP activity of Graf towards Rho family GTPases . RhoA , Rac1 , Cdc42 , and Ras GTPases were expressed in E . coli and puriﬁed as described in Materials and Methods . ( A ) Equal amounts ( in moles ) of each GTPase were preloaded with [ (cid:103) - 32 P ] GTP and incubated in either the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of puriﬁed Graf GAP domain . The amount of [ (cid:103) - 32 P ] GTP remaining bound to the GTPase was determined by a nitrocellulose ﬁltration assay ( see Materials and Methods ) ( 63 ) . Fold activation represents the ratio of radioactivity remaining following incubation in the absence of GAP domain versus the amount of radioactivity remaining following incubation in the presence of GAP domain . ( B ) cGraf was immunoprecipitated from 500 (cid:109) g of total cell protein with either MAb KT3 ( (cid:49) ) or a nonspeciﬁc MAb ( (cid:50) ) . One - ﬁfth of each immunoprecipitate was evaluated for the presence of cGraf by immu - noblotting with MAb KT3 ( inset ) . The remainder of each precipitation was subsequently incubated with puriﬁed [ (cid:103) - 32 P ] GTP - loaded GTPase ( indicated across the bottom ) . Following incubation , the supernatants were removed and assayed by nitrocellulose ﬁltration as described above . Each lane of the inset corresponds to the vertical data bar directly beneath it . For both panels A and B , all datum points represent the average value of at least three independent experiments , while the immunoblot of cGraf in panel B is representative of one such experiment . V OL . 16 , 1996 Graf , AN SH3 DOMAIN - CONTAINING RhoGAP 3173 actin cytoskeleton , including both actin stress ﬁbers and corti - cal actin ( open arrows , panels A and B ) . To assess the possible colocalization of Graf and ﬁlamentous actin , CE cells express - ing cGraf were costained with MAb to the KT3 tag ( panels C , E , and G ) and TRITC - phalloidin to detect actin stress ﬁbers ( panels D , F , and H ) . There was a signiﬁcant colocalization of cGraf with both actin stress ﬁbers ( C versus D and E versus F ) and cortical actin ( G versus H ) . The cells depicted in Fig . 6 also show that Graf overexpression may affect cytoskeleton integ - rity . The cell displayed in panels C and D had relatively low levels of cGraf expression and exhibited well - deﬁned actin stress ﬁbers and normal cell shape . In contrast , the cells shown in panels G and H displayed intense staining with KT3 ( G ) , contained few actin stress ﬁbers ( H ) , and exhibited an abnor - mal cell shape . Colocalization of FAK and cGraf . The ability of FAK and Graf to associate in vivo would indicate a possible role for this interaction in integrin - mediated signaling events . Thus , CE cells overexpressing both FAK and cGraf were immunostained by using MAb KT3 alone ( Fig . 7A ) or in combination with the FAK - speciﬁc polyclonal sera BC3 ( Fig . 7B and C ) . In CE cells expressing both FAK and cGraf , cGraf localized to structures similar to focal adhesions ( panel A ) . To further test if these cellular structures were focal contacts , cells were costained for the detection of cGraf ( panel B ) and FAK ( panel C ) . As shown in panels B and C , there was colocalization of cGraf and FAK in focal adhesion structures ( open arrows ) . In these cells , cGraf also colocalized with actin ﬁbers , whereas the FAK - speciﬁc antibody , BC3 , stained predominantly focal adhesions , indicat - ing that cGraf expression did not alter FAK localization . DISCUSSION Using expression cloning , we have identiﬁed a novel GAP for the Rho family GTPases that we refer to as Graf . Graf contains several readily identiﬁable domains , including a cen - trally located GAP domain , a serine - proline - rich domain , and a C - terminally located SH3 domain . To date , we have been unable to identify the authentic 5 (cid:57) end of the Graf cDNA ; thus , additional domains may reside N terminal to the consensus GAP domain . In addition , the presence of a serine - proline - rich domain predicts that Graf may be the target of proline - di - rected serine / threonine kinases , perhaps phosphorylating Graf in a cell cycle - speciﬁc fashion . Biochemical characterization of Graf demonstrates that Graf can function as a negative regu - lator of RhoA and Cdc42 . Graf also preferentially binds to the C - terminal domain of FAK via a proline - rich motif in FAK and the SH3 domain of Graf . The potential localization of a GAP for Cdc42 and / or Rho to cytoskeletal structures , including fo - cal adhesions and actin stress ﬁbers , is intriguing in light of the recent work implicating Rho family GTPases in regulating cytoskeletal organization and architecture ( including stress ﬁ - ber and focal adhesion formation , membrane rufﬂing , and ﬁlopodium outgrowth ) , kinase cascades , and gene expression ( 20 , 29 , 37 , 44 , 45 , 50 , 52 , 62 ) . Recent evidence shows that the Rho family GTPases Cdc42 , Rac , and Rho act in a cascade to regulate the formation of ﬁlopodia , lamellipodia , actin microﬁlaments , and focal adhe - sions ( 37 , 45 , 50 , 52 ) . The mechanism ( s ) by which integrin - ECM interactions trigger the activation of these GTPases is unclear . Despite the fact that several potential effectors of Cdc42 , Rac , and Rho have been characterized , the mecha - nisms by which these enzymes act to inﬂuence cytoskeletal architecture largely remains unknown . It has been reported that activated Rho regulates the production of 4 , 5 - PIP 2 by stimulating the activity of a phosphatidylinositol 5 (cid:57) - kinase ( PI 5 - K ) ( 16 ) . In turn , 4 , 5 - PIP 2 has been shown to regulate the FIG . 4 . In vitro binding of the Graf SH3 domain to FAK . GST - fusion pro - teins ( 5 (cid:109) g ) coupled to glutathione - Sepharose were added to 1 . 0 mg of total cell protein derived from CE cells and incubated for 1 h . Protein complexes associ - ated with the beads were pelleted , washed , resolved by SDS - PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose , and assayed by immunoblotting with the FAK - speciﬁc MAb 2A7 as described in Materials and Methods . Lysate ( lane 1 ) depicts the amount of immunoreactive FAK in 100 (cid:109) g of total cell protein and serves as a 10 % loading control . GST fusion proteins used for each sample are indicated across the top . FIG . 5 . Pro 878 in the FAK C terminus is essential for efﬁcient binding to the Graf SH3 domain . ( A ) To ensure that equal amounts of fusion protein were added to each sample , equal volumes of each GST - Cterm fusion protein were subjected to SDS - PAGE and Coomassie blue staining . ( B ) Equal amounts ( 5 (cid:109) g ) of GST , GST - Cterm , GST - CtermP878A , and GST - CtermP881A ( indicated across the top ) coupled to glutathione - Sepharose were added to 500 (cid:109) g of total cell protein derived from CE cells expressing cGraf ( lanes 2 and 4 to 6 ) and incubated for 1 h . Following incubation , protein complexes associated with the beads were pelleted , washed , resolved by SDS - PAGE , transferred to nitrocellu - lose , and assayed by immunoblotting with MAb KT3 as described in Materials and Methods . Lane 1 depicts the amount of cGraf in 50 (cid:109) g of total cell protein and serves as a 10 % loading control . For lane 3 , cell lysate derived from mock - transfected CE cells was used as a negative control . 3174 HILDEBRAND ET AL . M OL . C ELL . B IOL . FIG . 6 .

V OL . 16 , 1996 Graf , AN SH3 DOMAIN - CONTAINING RhoGAP 3175 function of several actin - binding proteins that are predicted to modulate the polymerization and depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments ( 21 , 33 , 39 , 67 ) . Thus , Rho may act in part to regulate actin microﬁlament assembly by regulating the production of PIP 2 . The evidence presented herein indicating an association of Graf , a negative regulator of both Cdc42 and RhoA , and FAK raises the possibility that Graf may have pleiotropic effects on integrin - mediated cell signaling . Unfortunately , to date we have been unable to detect endogenous Graf in ﬁbroblasts or other tissue extracts because of the poor immunoreactivity of current antibodies . Thus , we have been unable to establish deﬁnitively an in vivo interaction between endogenous Graf and FAK . Nonetheless , the in vitro association of the Graf SH3 domain with FAK , the apparent speciﬁcity of this interaction , and the localization of overexpressed Graf to focal adhesion structures suggest a potential interaction , a possibility that must be assessed by using better reagents . It is intriguing to speculate that Graf may function to down - regulate the Cdc42 - Rac - Rho GTPase cascade , perhaps atten - uating GTPase - mediated cellular responses to integrin - ECM interactions , including actin reorganization , tyrosine kinase cascades , and gene expression . Thus , the recruitment of Graf to newly assembled focal complexes ( or other FAK - containing structures ) may serve to place Cdc42 in the GDP - bound state , resulting in the attenuation of formation of ﬁlopodia , lamelli - podia , actin stress ﬁbers , and focal adhesions . These possibil - ities are testable and are currently under investigation . To date , many proteins exhibiting RhoGAP activity have been identiﬁed . In vivo , GAPs may exhibit exquisite substrate speciﬁcity , acting only on one subtype of GTPase ( 53 ) ; thus , multiple GAPs would be needed to regulate the large number of small GTPases identiﬁed to date . Alternatively , individual GAPs may be expressed in speciﬁc cell types or at speciﬁc stages of development , providing overlapping speciﬁcity for different small GTPases . Finally , individual GAPs may be reg - ulated spatially , biochemically , and / or temporally . In this sce - nario , a GAP may be targeted ( perhaps by phosphorylation ) to a speciﬁc subcellular compartment or regulated by speciﬁc environmental stimuli . While there are no reports of Rho - GAPs that possess regulated GAP activity , there is evidence for the directed subcellular localization of GAPs ; Myr5 and p120 RasGAP - associated p190 may associate with the actin cytoskeleton in vivo . Speciﬁcally , Myr5 demonstrates actin binding activity ( 47 ) and p190 shows colocalization with the actin cytoskeleton ( 13 ) . Graf provides another example of a GAP that may be targeted to the actin cytoskeleton . Since the SH3 domain has been shown to bind FAK directly , one might predict that the SH3 domain of Graf is also responsible for mediating its association with other components of the actin cytoskeleton ( 3 ) , thus targeting Graf to cortical actin and actin stress ﬁbers . Whereas only preliminary experiments address the tissue - or cell type - speciﬁc expression of Graf , it appears that Graf is evolutionarily conserved . Two expressed sequence tag se - quences , derived from Caenorhabditis elegans mRNA , contain a predicted open reading frame with signiﬁcant similarity to avian Graf ( accession no . D36250 and D36080 ; submitted by Yuji Kohara et al . ) . Sequence comparison of the Graf peptide sequence to the DNA database of the C . elegans genome proj - ect reveals two cosmid clones , zk328 and t04c9 , that , when translated , also display high sequence similarity to Graf . The homology between avian Graf and the predicted open reading frames of these cosmids and cDNAs spans the amino - terminal FIG . 7 . Colocalization of FAK and cGraf .

Thus , the conservation of Graf between vertebrates and invertebrates indicates that Graf may regulate common biological processes that have been conserved through evolution .
