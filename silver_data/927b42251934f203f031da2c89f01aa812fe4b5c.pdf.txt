Methods for Cell and Particle Tracking Erik Meijering , Oleh Dzyubachyk , Ihor Smal In Imaging and Spectroscopic Analysis of Living Cells Volume 504 of Methods in Enzymology ( P . M . Conn ed . ) Elsevier , February 2012 , Ch . 9 , pp . 183 - 200 Abstract : Achieving complete understanding of any living thing inevitably requires thorough analysis of both its anatomic and its dynamic properties . Live cell imaging experiments car - ried out to this end often produce massive amounts of time - lapse image data containing far more information than can be digested by a human observer . Computerized image analy - sis offers the potential to take full advantage of available data in an efﬁcient and reproducible manner . A recurring task in many experiments is the tracking of large numbers of cells or par - ticles and the analysis of their ( morpho ) dynamic behavior . In the past decade , many methods have been developed for this purpose , and software tools based on these are increasingly becoming available . Here we survey the latest developments in this area and discuss the var - ious computational approaches , software tools , and quantitative measures for tracking and motion analysis of cells and particles in time - lapse microscopy images . 1 Introduction A fundamental property of any real - world object is that it extends in both space and time . This is particularly true for living organisms , which , by deﬁnition , require the passage of time for their metabolism , growth , reac - tion to stimuli , and reproduction . Full understanding of any animate entity therefore necessitates studying not only its spatial ( anatomic ) but also its temporal ( dynamic ) properties ( Tsien , 2003 ) . It is therefore no surprise that research in medicine and biology has come to rely increasingly on time - lapse imaging and longitudinal examinations . In both the health sciences and the life sciences , the technologically deﬁcient times when researchers had to draw conclusions based on static two - dimensional ( 2D ) images are long gone , and it is now commonplace to image and study subjects in three dimensions over time ( denoted 3D + t or 4D ) . Live imaging of dynamic processes at the cellular and molecular lev - els has been made possible by the development of a vast spectrum of ﬂuo - rescent proteins and nanocrystals and groundbreaking advances in optical microscopy technology . The resulting increase in the amount , size , dimen - sionality , and complexity of the image data has brought about new chal - lenges for automated data analysis and management ( Vonesch et al . , 2006 ; Methods for Cell and Particle Tracking 2 0 0 . 01 0 . 02 0 . 03 0 . 04 0 . 05 0 . 06 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 " Cell Tracking " " Particle Tracking " " Cell " AND " Tracking " " Particle " AND " Tracking " Figure 1 : Percentage of publications in the PubMed database ( National Library of Medicine , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , USA ) as a function of publication year for the indicated combinations of words in the title and / or abstract . The plot shows the exponentially increasing interest in cell and particle tracking in the biomedical ( and related ) literature . No - tice that by plotting percentages ( of the total body of literature published in any given year ) we have corrected for the intrinsic growth of the number of publications . In other words , the curves indicate a rising “market share” of tracking related research . Rittscher , 2010 ; Peng , 2008 ; Swedlow et al . , 2009 ) . A topic for which in - terest has increased exponentially in recent years ( Figure 1 ) is object track - ing ( Zimmer et al . , 2006 ; Meijering et al . , 2006 , 2009 ; Dorn et al . , 2008 ; Jaqaman and Danuser , 2009 ; Rohr et al . , 2010 ) . Indeed , it is practically impossible to manually follow hundreds to thousands of cells or particles through many hundreds to thousands of image frames , and sophisticated computerized methods are very much needed for these tasks . Although ﬁrst attempts to automate the tracking of cells or particles by digital image processing date back at least 30 years , the development of more advanced tracking methods really took off in the past decade , and it is only since a couple of years that biology at large is able to reap the fruits of these efforts through the increased availability of software imple - mentations of such methods . The purpose of this article is to summarize these developments and to provide hands - on suggestions for practitioners in the ﬁeld . After a brief description of the main tracking approaches , we highlight freely available software tools for cell and particle tracking , dis - cuss frequently used measures to quantify dynamics , and conclude with concrete tips and tricks on various practical aspects . 2 Tracking Approaches Before discussing tracking tools it is useful to survey the different method - ological approaches on which these may be based . Since the appearance Methods for Cell and Particle Tracking 3 and behavior of cells can be quite different from particles , the image pro - cessing techniques developed to track them are usually also quite different , and are therefore discussed separately here . In either case , there are gen - erally two sides to the tracking problem : 1 ) the recognition of relevant objects and their separation from the background in every frame ( the seg - mentation step ) , and 2 ) the association of segmented objects from frame to frame and making connections ( the linking step ) . 2 . 1 Cell Tracking Approaches In images where the cells have sufﬁciently and consistently different inten - sities than their surroundings , they are most easily segmented by threshold - ing , which labels pixels above the intensity threshold as “object” and the remainder as “background” , after which disconnected regions can be auto - matically labeled as different cells . In the case of severe noise , autoﬂuo - rescence , photobleaching ( in ﬂuorescence microscopy ) , poor contrast , gra - dients , or halo artifacts ( in phase - contrast or differential interference con - trast microscopy ) , thresholding will fail , and more sophisticated segmenta - tion approaches are needed . Popular examples ( see Meijering et al . ( 2008 , 2009 ) for a more elaborate discussion ) are template matching ( which ﬁts predetermined patches or models to the image data but is robust only if cells have very similar shape ) , watershed transformation ( which completely separates images into regions and delimiting contours but may easily lead to oversegmentation ) , and deformable models ( which exploit both image information and prior shape information ) . The simplest approach to solving the subsequent association prob - lem is to link every segmented cell in any given frame to the nearest cell in the next frame , where “nearest” may refer to spatial distance but also to difference in intensity , volume , orientation , and other features . This nearest - neighbor solution works well as long as the cells are well sepa - rated in at least one of the dimensions of the feature space . Essentially , this criterion also applies to so - called online cell tracking approaches , which alternate between segmentation and linking on a per - frame basis . For in - stance , template matching , mean - shift processing , or deformable model ﬁtting is applied to one frame , and the found positions or contours are used to initialize the segmentation process in the next frame , and so on , which implicitly solves the linking problem ( see Figure 2 for an example result of applying such a scheme to a challenging tracking problem ) . 2 . 2 Particle Tracking Approaches Individual proteins or other ( macro ) molecular complexes within cells ( col - lectively referred to as particles ) are hardly ( if at all ) visible in brightﬁeld Methods for Cell and Particle Tracking 4 Figure 2 : Cell tracking and lineage reconstruction for studying embryogenesis . The top row shows four time points of a 3D + t ﬂuorescence microscopy image data set of a developing C . elegans embryo , starting from the four - cell stage until approximately the 350 - cell stage , with the segmentation and tracking results ( surface renderings with arbitrary colors ) overlaid on the raw image data ( volume renderings ) . In this case , a level - set based model evolution approach was used for segmentation and tracking , modiﬁed from Dzyubachyk et al . ( 2010a ) . The bottom graph shows the lineage tree automatically derived from the tracking results , with the horizontal guidelines ( red , dashed ) corresponding to the four time points . or phase - contrast microscopy and require ﬂuorescent labeling and imaging . Since ﬂuorescent proteins are two orders of magnitude smaller ( nanome - ter range ) than the optical resolution of typical microscopes ( 100 nm or worse ) , they appear as diffraction limited spots ( foci ) in the images . If their contrast to the background is sufﬁciently large throughout the image , they can be localized to nanometer resolution by intensity thresholding and computing the centroid position of each segmented spot , or by ﬁtting a theoretical or experimentally acquired model of the point spread function ( Cheezum et al . , 2001 ; Carter et al . , 2005 ) . However , in live cell imaging , the contrast is often poor , and more sophisticated approaches are needed . The results of a recent comparison study ( Smal et al . , 2010 ) suggest that better results can be obtained by specialized algorithms from mathematical morphology and supervised ( machine - learning ) approaches . Similar to cell tracking , the most straightforward strategy to solve the association problem is to apply local nearest - neighbor linking . However , in the case of particle tracking , the available information to resolve poten - Methods for Cell and Particle Tracking 5 Figure 3 : Particle tracking for studying vesicle dynamics . The left image shows the last frame of a 2D + t ﬂuorescence microscopy image sequence of vesicles moving in the cyto - plasm , with the detection and tracking results overlaid ( arbitrarily colored trajectories ) . The results , adapted from Smal et al . ( 2008 ) , were obtained using a tracking algorithm based on a Bayesian estimation framework , implemented by particle ﬁltering . On the right , the trajec - tories are alternatively presented in a spatiotemporal rendering . tial ambiguities in the matching process is much more limited ( often the particles all have similar appearance ) . In addition , particles may disappear , ( re ) appear , split , and merge . More consistent results can be achieved by using global rather than local linking strategies . Examples include spa - tiotemporal tracing ( Bonneau et al . , 2005 ) and graph - based optimization approaches ( Sbalzarini and Koumoutsakos , 2005 ; Jaqaman et al . , 2008 ) . Alternatively , various Bayesian estimation approaches have been explored in recent years ( Genovesio et al . , 2006 ; Smal et al . , 2008 ; Godinez et al . , 2009 ) , with promising results ( see Figure 3 for an example ) . 3 Tracking Tools Computational approaches to cell and particle tracking as described in the previous section are interesting in their own right , but have no value to practitioners in the ﬁeld unless they are implemented and released in the form of user - friendly software tools . Fortunately there is an increasing tendency among computer scientists , spurred by various open source and reproducible research movements , to go the extra mile and develop such tools . Table 1 lists over 30 currently available tools for cell and / or particle tracking , their main features , and where to ﬁnd more detailed information about them . Here we brieﬂy comment on common aspects .

The columns indicate ( from left to right ) the name of the tool , availability ( Free = freeware , Paid = paid license code required or available as a paid service only , Request = freely available from the developers on request ) , the platform on which the tool runs ( Java = runs on all platforms with the Java Virtual Machine installed , ImageJ = plugin for ImageJ and runs on all platforms with Java installed , IDL = runs on all platforms with the IDL Virtual Machine installed , Matlab = runs on all platforms with Matlab installed , Lin = distribution for Linux , Mac = distribution for Mac OS X , Win = distribution for Microsoft Windows ) , whether source code is available , whether it was developed primarily for cell tracking or for particle tracking , whether it can track multiple objects , the maximum spatial dimensionality per frame it can handle ( 2D image or 3D stack ) , the level of automation ( Auto = automatic after initial parameter setting , Manual = requires continuous user input , Semi = partly automatic but requires user input ) , the author of the tool or a literature reference ( with year ) describing the tool , and ﬁnally the website where to ﬁnd the tool . 3 . 1 Cell Tracking Tools The general assumption made by most cell tracking tools is that the cells can be modeled as bright regions against a darker background ( the ﬂuo - rescence microscopy scenario ) . If this is not the case , or if the images are too noisy , it is necessary to apply suitable ﬁlters to match this as - sumption . Most commercial tracking tools ( such as Volocity , ImarisTrack , MetaMorph , Image - Pro Plus ) , as well as more general purpose open source software packages ( CellProﬁler , FARSIGHT , ICY , and ImageJ / Fiji ) , offer ample functionality for image preprocessing . Virtually all cell tracking tools are capable of tracking multiple cells and allow the user to compute basic dynamics parameters from the result - ing trajectories . Few tools ( such as StarryNite ) are designed speciﬁcally for the study of embryogenesis , which requires not only segmentation and tracking of individual cells , but also accurate handling of all cell divisions and the reconstruction of the complete cell lineage tree . Several freeware tools ( such as AceTree ( Boyle et al . , 2006 ; Murray et al . , 2006 ) , and ALES ( Braun et al . , 2003 ) , not listed in the table ) are available for the visualiza - tion , curation , and analysis of the cell lineages . 3 . 2 Particle Tracking Tools Similar to cell tracking , most particle tracking tools , too , assume the target objects ( foci ) to be signiﬁcantly brighter than the local background , and preﬁltering ( noise reduction and deconvolution ) of the images generally has a positive impact on their performance . In contrast with the mentioned commercial tools , many of which contain functionality for both cell track - ing and particle tracking and are stand - alone applications , most freeware particle tracking tools are available either as a plugin of the widely used Methods for Cell and Particle Tracking 8 ImageJ / Fiji image analysis platform ( MTrack2 , Octane , ParticleTracker , SpotTracker ) , or as a Matlab module ( plusTipTracker , u - track ) . While all tracking tools generally perform well if the image data sat - isﬁes certain conditions ( see the tips and tricks at the end of this article ) , experimental constraints often force these conditions to be violated , as a re - sult of which automated tracking falls short or fails completely . Fixated on full automation , most tools offer very little functionality for manual trajec - tory inspection , curation , or creation . A tool speciﬁcally designed for this purpose is MTrackJ , an ImageJ / Fiji plugin , which at the time of writing has already been used in over a 100 scientiﬁc journal publications , testifying that fully automated tracking is still utopian in many situations . 4 Tracking Measures The direct result of applying tracking tools is a sequence of coordinates indicating the position of each tracked object at each time point . While this is an essential step and a tremendous data reduction , from millions to billions of ( mostly irrelevant ) pixels to a few ( or perhaps a few tens or hun - dreds of ) thousands of coordinate values , by itself this does not lead to new insights . The ﬁnal step to knowledge is the computation of biologically meaningful quantitative measures from these coordinates . Here we distin - guish four categories of measures , characterizing the motility , diffusivity , velocity , and morphology of the moving objects , respectively . 4 . 1 Motility Measures The ﬁrst step towards quantitative analysis is to reconstruct the trajecto - ries of the tracked objects from the measured coordinates . This problem of “connecting the dots” is practically always solved by linear interpola - tion , resulting in piecewise - linear trajectories , although higher - order in - terpolation schemes ( in particular cubic splines ) can be expected to yield ( bio ) physically more accurate representations . Given the trajectories , a va - riety of measures can be straightforwardly computed . The most obvious measures of motility include ( see Table 2 for deﬁnitions ) the total trajec - tory length ( the total distance traveled by the corresponding object ) , the distance between start and end point ( the net distance traveled ) , the max - imum distance to the start ( or any other reference ) point , and the conﬁne - ment ratio ( also referred to as the meandering index or the straightness index ) ( Beltman et al . , 2009 ) . Related measures , but for which varying deﬁnitions are found in the literature , include the chemotactic index and the McCutcheon index ( Meijering et al . , 2008 ) . Other obvious measures to compute are local orientations ( with respect to the coordinate system or Methods for Cell and Particle Tracking 9 Measure Deﬁnition Total distance traveled d tot = ∑ N − 1 i = 1 d ( p i , p i + 1 ) Net distance traveled d net = d ( p 1 , p N ) Maximum distance traveled d max = max i d ( p 1 , p i ) Total trajectory time t tot = ( N − 1 ) ∆ t Conﬁnement ratio r con = d net / d tot Instantaneous angle α i = arctan ( y i + 1 − y i ) / ( x i + 1 − x i ) Directional change γ i = α i − α i − 1 Instantaneous speed v i = d ( p i , p i + 1 ) / ∆ t Mean curvilinear speed ¯ v = 1 N − 1 ∑ N − 1 i = 1 v i Mean straight - line speed v lin = d net / t tot Linearity of forward progression r lin = v lin / ¯ v Mean squared displacement MSD ( n ) = 1 N − n ∑ N − n i = 1 d 2 ( p i , p i + n ) Table 2 : Quantitative tracking measures commonly found in the literature . The drawing ( top ) shows a sample trajectory consisting of N points p i = ( x i , y i ) and the table ( bottom ) deﬁnes the measures . The example is given for the 2D + t case but the measures can be extended straightforwardly to 3D + t . A constant frame rate is assumed with a time interval of ∆ t seconds between successive frames . The distance d ( p i , p j ) between any two points p i and p j is usually taken to be the Euclidean norm (cid:107) p i − p j (cid:107) . a reference point ) , directional change ( turning angle ) ( Soll , 1995 ; Beltman et al . , 2009 ) , and the autocorrelation of the latter , which is indicative of directional persistence and process memory . 4 . 2 Diffusivity Measures A more sophisticated measure computable from a trajectory is the mean squared displacement ( MSD ) . It is a function of time lag ( see Table 2 ) and enables one to characterize the mode of motion of the corresponding object by inspection of the resulting MSD - time curve ( Qian et al . , 1991 ; Methods for Cell and Particle Tracking 10 Saxton and Jacobson , 1997 ) . In the case of a pure random walk ( such as Brownian motion of particles ) , the curve will be a straight line , given by MSD ( t ) = cDt , with c = 4 in 2D and c = 6 in 3D , and where D denotes the so - called diffusion coefﬁcient . If the motion is impeded by obstacles , the diffusion is anomalous , and characterized by MSD ( t ) = cDt α with α < 1 . An object whose motion is conﬁned to some region , will yield a curve that may be modeled as MSD ( t ) = R [ 1 − a 1 exp ( − a 2 cDt / R ) ] , which converges to a maximum value R proportional to the size of the region , where a 1 and a 2 are positive constants related to the geometry of that region . The ultimate case of R = 0 , corresponding to immobile objects , results in a curve that is zero everywhere . On the other hand , if there is directed motion ( ﬂow ) in addition to diffusion , the curve behaves as MSD ( t ) = cDt + ( vt ) 2 , where v is the speed . Notice that the MSD is just the second - order moment of displacement . It may be helpful to compute other moment orders as well ( Sbalzarini and Koumoutsakos , 2005 ) . 4 . 3 Velocity Measures Other measures that can be easily derived from a trajectory are those con - cerning the rate of displacement . Instantaneous velocity , for example , is computed as the displacement from one frame to the next , divided by the time interval ( Table 2 ) . Notice that this quantity is a vector , and its magni - tude value is called speed , although in the literature the latter is also often referred to as velocity . A useful measure derived from instantaneous speed is the arrest coefﬁcient ( Beltman et al . , 2009 ) , deﬁned as the fraction of time that the object is pausing ( having a speed less than some minimum value ) . The mean curvilinear speed is computed as the arithmetic mean of the instantaneous speeds . If the frame rate is constant , that is if the time elapsed between any two successive frames in the image sequence is the same , this is equal to computing the ratio between the total distance trav - eled and the total trajectory time . Alternatively , if we use the net distance traveled , the ratio yields the mean straight - line speed . The ratio between the latter and the former speeds is a measure expressing the linearity of forward progression . Rather than taking grand averages , it is often useful to make speed histograms ( Qian et al . , 1991 ; Bahnson et al . , 2005 ) , as they give more insight into the statistics of the dynamics . 4 . 4 Morphology Measures In contrast with particle tracking , cell tracking algorithms usually record the entire cell shape at each time point , from which a position estimate is commonly derived by computing the centroid , to which , in turn , the above mentioned measures can be applied . Having the full shape as a function of Methods for Cell and Particle Tracking 11 time also allows for the computation of a host of measures characterizing the cell morphology ( Soll , 1995 ; Bakal et al . , 2007 ) . A distinction can be made here between measures of size and orientation versus measures of geometric complexity . Examples of the former in the case of 2D + t ( and 3D + t ) include the perimeter ( surface area ) , area ( volume ) , and the major and minor axes . Measures of ( size and orientation invariant ) complexity include circularity ( sphericity ) , eccentricity ( ellipticity ) , and convexity or concavity . More sophisticated analysis of morphology is possible by de - composing the shape in terms of Zernike polynomials , or based on Fourier analysis , independent component analysis ( ICA ) , or principal component analysis ( PCA ) , the latter of which appears to be most suitable ( see Pincus and Theriot ( 2007 ) for a thorough discussion ) . 5 Tips and Tricks Concluding this article , we complement our discussion of tracking meth - ods , tools , and measures with tips and tricks ( including some serious warn - ings ) concerning the imaging , tracking , and analysis . Since research goals , available equipment , and experimental conditions may vary widely , it is impossible to provide detailed protocols here . Nevertheless , the following general remarks should serve as a good basis for further consideration in designing cell and particle tracking experiments . 5 . 1 Imaging • Dimensionality : The ﬁrst thing to consider in preparing a time - lapse imaging experiment is whether to study the processes of interest in 2D or in 3D over time . If photobleaching and photodamage are to be min - imized , or when dealing with very rapid motion of cells or particles , 3D + t imaging may simply be no option in view of the excess exposure and recording times required . However , biological processes naturally do take place in 3D + t , and it has been shown in various studies that 2D + t imaging and analysis may lead to different results ( Meijering et al . , 2008 ) . It is therefore important to verify one’s assumptions . • Image quality : One of the most critical factors affecting the perfor - mance of tracking tools is the signal - to - noise ratio ( SNR ) of the image data . Several studies ( Cheezum et al . , 2001 ; Carter et al . , 2005 ; Smal et al . , 2010 ) have indicated that the accuracy , precision , and robust - ness of most particle detection and tracking methods drop rapidly for SNR < 4 . Thus , in order to minimize tracking errors , the illumination settings should be such that at least this SNR is reached . Even though for cell tracking the SNR may be somewhat less critical than for particle Methods for Cell and Particle Tracking 12 tracking ( as cells are much larger and therefore more clearly visible ) , it is advisable to use a similar minimum level . • Frame rate : Another critical imaging parameter to be tuned carefully is temporal resolution . It is obvious that in the case of directed mo - tion , the lower the frame rate , the larger the distances traveled by the objects between frames , and thus the higher the chance of ambiguities in reconstructing trajectories . For cell tracking , as a rule of thumb , the frame rate should be chosen such that cells move less than their diame - ter from frame to frame ( Zimmer et al . , 2006 ) . For particle tracking , it has been suggested ( Jaqaman and Danuser , 2009 ) that in order for the nearest - neighbor linking scheme ( used in many tools ) to perform well , the ratio ( ρ ) of the average frame - to - frame displacement and the average nearest - neighbor distance within frames should be ρ (cid:28) 0 . 5 . 5 . 2 Tracking • Preprocessing : In live - cell imaging , the SNR ( directly related to light exposure ) is often deliberately minimized to avoid photobleaching and photodamage , while it ought to be maximized to ensure high tracking performance . This conﬂict of requirements may be resolved to some extent by processing the data prior to tracking . Noise reduction ﬁlters are widely available and in some tracking tools they are an integral part of the processing pipeline . Sophisticated ﬁlters have also been developed to transform transmitted light contrast images into pseudo - ﬂuorescence images ( Xiong and Iglesias , 2010 ) , making them suitable for processing by tracking tools designed for ﬂuorescence microscopy . • Tool selection : As shown in this article , quite a number of tools al - ready exist for cell and particle tracking , and it seems likely that more tools will become available in the near future . There is no single cri - terion to decide which of these is best for a given purpose , but Table 1 provides hints where to start looking . Commercial tools usually offer the most user - friendly interfaces and extensive functionality but may be prohibitively expensive . For many tracking and motion analysis tasks , freeware tools are often sufﬁcient , and if source code is available , it is usually not difﬁcult to tailor a tool to one’s needs . • Veriﬁcation : The results of automated tracking are rarely perfect . The lower the SNR , or the larger the number of objects , their density , motil - ity , or similarity , the larger the risk of tracking errors . It is therefore advisable to visually inspect ( a representative part of ) the trajectories prior to analysis , and , where necessary , to ﬁx erroneous track initiation , termination , duplication , switching , splitting , and merging events ( Belt - Methods for Cell and Particle Tracking 13 man et al . , 2009 ) . Unfortunately , most tools ( especially freeware ) lack ﬂexible track editing functionalities , and it may be helpful to use tools ( such as MTrackJ ) designed speciﬁcally for this purpose . 5 . 3 Analysis • Diffusivity : Several warnings are in order when estimating diffusion coefﬁcients from MSD - time curves ( Meijering et al . , 2008 ) . First , the 2D diffusion coefﬁcient ( computed from 2D tracking ) is equal to the 3D coefﬁcient only in isotropic media , where displacements in the three spa - tial dimensions are uncorrelated . Second , the shorter the trajectories , the higher the inaccuracy of diffusion estimates . Third , even for long trajec - tories , the inherent localization uncertainty may cause apparent subdif - fusion patterns at short time scales . Finally , a trajectory may contain both diffusive and nondiffusive parts , which are obscured if the MSD is computed over the entire trajectory . • Velocity : The estimation of velocities based on ﬁnite differencing of subsequent position estimates implicitly assumes linear motion from frame to frame . It is important to realize that this minimalist approach yields the lowest possible estimate , and results in underestimation of the true velocities in cases where the dynamics is more complex . Another warning concerns velocity estimation of migrating cells . Commonly this is based on the cell centroid position . However , in the case of consid - erable shape changes , the centroid position may show a much larger ﬂuctuation , and is no longer representative . • Aggregation : A ﬁnal issue to consider is how to aggregate the esti - mates of a parameter when tracking multiple objects . In principle there are two approaches ( Beltman et al . , 2009 ) : object - based or frame - based , which may lead to different results , depending on the statistic . For ex - ample , when tracking objects consisting of two subpopulations ( slow and fast moving ) , a histogram of the per - object mean speeds will reveal this , whereas the per - frame mean speed histogram does not . Conversely , frame - based analyses would allow the detection of different modes of motion ( for a single object or a population of synchronized objects ) , which may go unnoticed with an object - based approach .
