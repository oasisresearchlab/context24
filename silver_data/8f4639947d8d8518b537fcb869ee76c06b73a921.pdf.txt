INTRODUCTION Transport of proteins between compartments of the endo - cytic and secretory pathways occurs mainly via vesicles coated with speciﬁc cytosolic proteins ( Mellman , 1996 ; Roth - man and Wieland , 1996 ) . One of the best characterized coat protein is clathrin , which , in association with adaptor com - plexes ( APs ) , participates in multiple transport steps ( Hirst and Robinson , 1998 ; Smith and Pearse , 1999 ) . Four different AP complexes have been identiﬁed ( AP - 1 to AP - 4 ; Boehm and Bonifacino , 2001 ) . All APs share a similar composition . They are comprised of two large subunits ( 80 – 130 kDa ) , one medium size subunit ( 50 kDa ) , and one small subunit ( 20 kDa ) . For instance , AP - 1 contains (cid:2) 1 - and (cid:1) - adaptin large chains , a (cid:3) 1A or (cid:3) 1B medium chain , and a (cid:4) 1A or (cid:4) 1B small chain ( Scales et al . , 2000 ) . Cargo sorting relies on (cid:2) - adaptin and (cid:3) chains . These two chains recognize tyrosine - and leucine - based sorting signals found in the cytoplasmic domains of cargo proteins ( Ohno et al . , 1995 ; Rapoport et al . , 1998 ) , thereby concentrating them into bud - ding vesicles . Each individual AP complex functions at a distinct intra - cellular site ( Kirchhausen , 1999 ) . Hence , AP - 1 is mainly re - Article published online ahead of print . Mol . Biol .

Recently , the function of AP - 1 in membrane traf - ﬁc has been carefully reassessed . Gene targeted disruption of (cid:3) 1A or (cid:1) - adaptin in mice and of (cid:3) 1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggested that AP - 1 is required for retrograde transport from endosomes to the TGN of mannose 6 - phos - phate receptors ( MPR ) in mammalian cells as well as chitin synthase III and syntaxin Tlg1p in yeast cells ( Zizioli et al . , 1999 ; Meyer et al . , 2000 ; Valdivia et al . , 2002 ) . However , studies on the dynamics of AP - 1 followed in living cells expressing yellow - ﬂuorescent - protein – tagged (cid:3) 1 revealed that AP - 1 is mainly associated with transport structures moving from the TGN toward the cell periphery , whereas AP - 1 – associated retrograde transport appears to rarely oc - cur ( Huang et al . , 2001 ) . In addition , AP - 1 has been impli - cated both in the transport of the transferrin receptor from apical to basolateral membranes in epithelial cells ( Futter et al . , 1998 ) and the recycling of the low - density lipoprotein receptor and the transferrin receptor to the basolateral mem - brane ( Gan et al . , 2002 ) . AP - 1 was also reported to mediate transport from the TGN to the basolateral membrane of many membrane proteins ( Folsch et al . , 1999 , 2001 ) . Thus AP - 1 could function in more than one location ; however , how a single vesicular coat could play multiple roles is not understood yet . The amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a genetically trac - table eukaryotic cell that is commonly used as cellular model to study membrane trafﬁcking in the endocytic pathways . Being a professional phagocyte , Dictyostelium binds to and internalizes large size particles ( (cid:1) 1 (cid:3) m ) by phagocytosis ( Maniak , 1999 ; Neuhaus and Soldati , 1999 ; Cardelli , 2001 ; Maniak , 2001 ; Rupper and Cardelli , 2001 ) . Laboratory strains can also grow in axenic liquid culture medium . Flu - id - phase nutrients are then mainly internalized by macropi - nocytosis , concentrated in endosomes , and degraded in ly - sosomes . Undigested material can eventually be returned to the cell surface via postlysosomal vacuoles ( Neuhaus and Soldati , 1999 ) . The biosynthesis of lysosomal enzymes in Dictyostelium is similar to that in mammalian cells ( Cardelli , 1993 ) . Newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases are ﬁrst syn - thesized as membrane - bound , N - glycosylated precursor proteins in the ER and then transported to the Golgi . How - ever , in contrast to mammalian cells where lysosomal en - zymes are targeted to lysosomes through the recognition of mannose 6 - phosphate ( M6P ) sugars by MPRs , the sorting machinery recognizing M6P sugars is poorly characterized in Dictyostelium , and in particular MPRs have not been iden - tiﬁed yet ( Cardelli , 1993 ) . The fact that the clathrin heavy chain is required for proper sorting of lysosomal enzymes ( Ruscetti et al . , 1994 ) suggests that clathrin - coated vesicles play a crucial role in this process in Dictyostelium . As a ﬁrst step toward a better understanding of AP - 1 – dependent transport mechanisms , we decided to investigate AP - 1 function in the model organism Dictyostelium . Here we report for the ﬁrst time the molecular and functional char - acterization of the AP - 1 complex in this organism . Together our data provide new evidence for the sorting function of AP - 1 in the endocytic pathway and uncover the role of AP - 1 in CV biogenesis . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture , Development , and Secretion Assay D . discoideum strain DH1 – 10 ( Cornillon et al . , 2000 ) was cultured at 22°C in HL5 medium . To measure growth on bacterial lawns , cells were mixed with 400 (cid:3) l of overnight liquid culture of Klebsiella aerogenes and plated on SM nutrient agar plates ( Kay , 1987 ) . For developmental analysis , cells were plated on 0 . 45 - (cid:3) m membrane ﬁlters ( Whatman , Maidstone , UK ) laid on Na / K phosphate buffer and incubated at 24°C in humid chambers ( Sussman , 1987 ) . To assess constitutive secretion in HL5 culture medium , cells were resuspended in HL5 at 5 (cid:2) 10 6 cells / ml and incubated at 22°C . After 10 h , culture medium was TCA precipitated and pellets were ana - lyzed by Western blotting . Electron Microscopy For conventional electron microscopy the cells were processed as described ( Orci et al . , 1973 ) . Sections were photographed in a Philips CM - 10 transmission electron microscope ( Philips , Eindhoven , The Netherlands ) at calibrated magniﬁcations . Antibodies and Immunoﬂuorescence Microscopy Polyclonal antibodies to Dictyostelium (cid:3) 1 and (cid:1) - adaptin were raised in rabbits using KLH - coupled peptides ( 320 VPPDADTPKFRC 331 ; Covalab , Lyon , France ) and GST - (cid:1) ( 592 – 896 ) recombinant protein , respectively . Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Dictyostelium cathepsin D ( Journet et al . , 1999 ) and clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) were gifts from Dr . J . Garin ( CEA , Grenoble , France ) and Dr . T . O’Halloran ( University of Texas , Austin , TX ) , respectively . Mouse monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) against (cid:5) - mannosidase ( 2H9 ; Mierendorf et al . , 1983 ) , comitin ( 190 - 68 - 1 ; Weiner et al . , 1993 ) , and a Golgi unknown antigen ( 1 / 39 ; Graf et al . , 1999 ) , were kind gifts from Dr . H . Freeze ( University of California , La Jolla , CA ) , Dr . A . Noegel ( University of Ko¨ln , Germany ) , and Dr . R . Gra¨f ( Muenchen , Germany ) . Monoclo - nal antibodies ( mAbs ) against coronin ( 176 - 2 - 5 ) , vacuolin B ( 221 - 1 - 1 ) , and the A subunit of the vacuolar H (cid:3) - ATPase ( 221 - 35 - 2 ) have been characterized previously ( Zhu and Clarke , 1992 ; Jenne et al . , 1998 ; Neuhaus et al . , 1998 ; de Hostos , 1999 ) . The rat antiphagosome mAb M12A9 was reported to cross - react with Dictyostelium (cid:1) - adap - tin ( Morrissette et al . , 1999 ) . The mAb H161 , speciﬁc for a p80 cell surface marker , has been described ( Ravanel et al . , 2001 ) . Rh50 was stained with a rabbit polyclonal antibody ( Benghezal et al . , 2001 ) . To allow simultaneous labeling with an anti - p80 antibody and another mouse mAb , the H161 antibody was directly coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 ( Molecular Probes , Leiden , Netherlands ) according to manufac - turer’s instructions , and cells were processed for immunoﬂuores - cence as described ( Ravanel et al . , 2001 ) . For indirect immunoﬂuo - rescence analysis , unless indicated , cells were grown on glass coverslips for 3 days , ﬁxed with (cid:4) 20°C methanol for 10 min , incu - bated with the indicated antibodies for 1 h , and then stained with corresponding ﬂuorescent secondary antibodies . Cells were visual - ized with a Zeiss confocal microscope ( LSM510 ) ( LePecq , France ) . For ﬂuorescence microscopy in living cells , just prior observation cells were compressed under a thin layer of agarose ( Yumura et al . , 1984 ) . For excitation of all GFP constructs , the 488 band of an argon - ion laser was used together with a 515 – 565 ﬁlter for emission . For epiﬂuorescence microscopy cells were observed using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope . Immunoprecipitation , Binding Assay , and Western Blotting For immunoprecipitations , 10 7 cells were lysed in lysis buffer ( PBS , 10 mM EDTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 , protease inhibitors ) and cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 13 , 000 rpm in a microfuge . About 1 mg of protein extract was incubated overnight at 4°C with mAb M12A9 and Gammabind Sepharose beads ( Amersham Pharmacia , Orsay , Y . Lefkir et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 1836 France ) . The beads were then washed three times in lysis buffer and twice in 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , and bound proteins analyzed by immunoblots . SDSpolyacrylamideelectrophoresisandimmunoblot - ting were performed as previously described ( Cornillon et al . , 2000 ) . Bands were visualized using an ECF kit ( Amersham Pharmacia ) and a STORM Imager ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) . Bind - ing assays between GST - (cid:1) fusion proteins and cytosol were carried out as described ( Doray and Kornfeld , 2001 ) . Gel Filtration , Sucrose Gradient Fractionation To prepare cytosol , Dictyostelium cells were washed twice in break - ing buffer ( 1 mM EDTA , 150 mM NaCl , 20 mM MES - Na buffer , pH 6 . 5 , 10 mM iodoacetamide , protease inhibitor cocktail ) , suspended at 4 (cid:2) 10 8 cells / ml in the same buffer and then broken by six strokes in a ball - bearing cell cracker ( Balch and Rothman , 1985 ) . Unbroken cells were removed by low speed centrifugation ( 1000 (cid:2) g , 5 min , 4°C ) . The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100 , 000 (cid:2) g for 1 h in a SW50Ti rotor . Cytosol was collected and then loaded onto a HiPrep 16 / 60 Sephacryl S - 300 HR gel ﬁltration column ( Amersham Pharmacia ) equilibrated in breaking buffer . One - milliliter fractions were collected , and protein contents were TCA precipitated before SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting analysis . Membrane preparations and sucrose gradient fractionation were carried out as reported ( Bogdanovic et al . , 2000 ) . Plasmids and Cell Transfection Full - length ( nucleotides 1 – 1287 ) and truncated ( nucleotides 1 – 1233 ) apm1 cDNAs , encoding (cid:3) 1 and (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct , respectively , were ampliﬁed by PCR , sequenced ( MWG - Biotech , Ebersberg , Germany ) , and cloned into the Dictyostelium expression vector pDXA - 3C ( Manstein et al . , 1995 ) . Plasmid were transfected in Dictyostelium by electropo - ration as described ( Cornillon et al . , 2000 ) . (cid:1) - Adaptin encoding cDNA was isolated by PCR screening of a cDNA library kindly provided by Dr . Fuller ( University of California , San Diego , CA ) with oligonucleotides derived from a partial gene sequence ( con - tig6354 ) encoding part of Dictyostelium (cid:1) - adaptin . A full - length cDNA insert ( GenBank accession number AY144597 ) was se - quenced on both strands and cloned into pDXA - 3C . For GFP tag - ging of (cid:1) - adaptin , a GFP insert was obtained by PCR using pTX - GFP as template ( Levi et al . , 2000 ) and inserted before the stop coding of (cid:1) cDNA . (cid:1) - GFP was included in AP - 1 complexes and partitioned into membranes and cytosol as native (cid:1) - adaptin and , very few monomeric (cid:1) - GFP proteins were detected in cytosol frac - tionated by gel ﬁltration on a Sephacryl S300 column ( our unpub - lished results ) . GST - (cid:1) constructs were made by PCR and subcloned into the vector pGEX - 4T ( Amersham Pharmacia ) . Apm1 Knockout DNA fragments comprising nucleotides 373 – 578 ( 5 (cid:6) fragment ) and 579 - 1287 ( 3 (cid:6) fragment ) of apm1 cDNA were ampliﬁed by PCR from DH1 - 10 genomic DNA and cloned into pCRII - TOPO ( Invitrogen , Groningen , Netherlands ) . The apm1 knockout construct was made by inserting the blasticidin resistance cassette ( Sutoh , 1993 ) between the 5 (cid:6) and 3 (cid:6) apm1 fragments . The ﬁnal construct was linearized by Sal I and electroporated into DH1 - 10 cells as for complementation studies . Transformants were selected in the presence of 10 (cid:3) g / ml blasticidin , and individual colonies were tested by Southern blot and immunoblotting . Four independent clones were identiﬁed and displayed identical phenotypes . One clone was chosen for further characterization . RESULTS Biochemical Characterization of Dictyostelium AP - 1 Complex Clathrin - associated adaptor complexes are essential compo - nents of the mammalian endocytic and biosynthetic trans - port pathways . As a ﬁrst step toward the understanding of AP - 1 function in Dictyostelium , we undertook the molecular characterization of AP - 1 subunits in this organism . First , the AP - 1 medium chain ( (cid:3) 1 ) was clearly identiﬁed because it shares 69 % identity with the (cid:3) 1A subunit of the mouse AP - 1 complex ( de Chassey et al . , 2001 ) . A rabbit polyclonal anti - body against (cid:3) 1 was raised , and this antiserum recognized a protein with an electrophoretic mobility of 50 kDa ( Figure 1A ) as predicted from its cDNA sequence . Next , the identi - ﬁcation of the (cid:1) - adaptin subunit was facilitated by the char - acterization of an antimurine phagosome mAb ( M12A9 ) that Figure 1 . Biochemical characterization of (cid:3) 1 - containing AP com - plexes . ( A ) (cid:3) 1 and (cid:1) - adaptin are subunits of 300 - kDa cytosolic complexes . Dictyostelium cytosol from wild - type ( DH1 ) was frac - tionated on a Sephacryl S - 300 HR gel ﬁltration column . Fractions were collected and proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using the anti - (cid:3) 1 antiserum or the anti – (cid:1) - adaptin mAb M12A9 . In DH1 cells , (cid:3) 1 and (cid:1) - adaptin are detected in a peak fraction corre - sponding to an apparent size of (cid:7) 300 kDa . ( B ) (cid:3) 1 and (cid:1) - adaptin belong to same AP - 1 complexes . Cell lysates were incubated either with Gammabind beads alone ( beads ) , rat anti - HA antibody bound beads ( clone 3F10 ; anti - HA ) or anti – (cid:1) - adaptin mAb bound beads ( M12A9 , anti - (cid:1) ) . Bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti - (cid:3) 1 and anti - Cathepsin D ( CatD ) rabbit antisera . To eval - uate the amount of (cid:3) 1 and CatD in the lysates , 1 / 80 of the amount of cells lysate incubated with beads was loaded on the gel ( lysate ) . ( C ) The (cid:3) 1 chain is detected in Golgi - enriched fractions . Total membranes were fractionated on linear 15 – 57 % sucrose gradients . After centrifugation at 100 , 000 (cid:2) g for 3 h , fractions were collected , and proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE . The distribution of (cid:3) 1 ( circles ) , comitin ( squares ) , and a Golgi unknown protein ( triangles ) were determined by Western blotting , quantiﬁed , and expressed as a percentage of total signal throughout all fractions . Sucrose per - centages are indicated by small closed circles . Dictyostelium AP - 1 Vol . 14 , May 2003 1837 cross - reacts with Dictyostelium phagosomes ( Morrissette et al . , 1999 ) . In Dictyostelium , this antibody recognized a 100 - kDa protein ( Figure 1A ) , consistent with the molecular mass of APs large subunits . Molecular cloning of the correspond - ing cDNA suggested that this protein could correspond to Dictyostelium (cid:1) - adaptin because the deduced protein se - quence shares 44 % of identity with the human (cid:1) 1 - adaptin ( Figure 2 ) . To determine whether (cid:3) 1 and (cid:1) - adaptin associate with other subunits to form a bona ﬁde AP - 1 complex , Dictyoste - lium cytosol was fractionated by gel ﬁltration on a Sephacryl S300 column . (cid:3) 1 and (cid:1) - adaptin were detected in fractions 16 – 26 , peaking at fraction 20 , which corresponds to an ap - parent size of (cid:7) 300 kDa ( Figure 1A ) as observed for AP - 1 complexes in different species ( Kirchhausen , 1999 ) . The as - sumption that both chains were subunits of the same adap - tor complex was further strengthened by the ﬁnding that the (cid:3) 1 subunit , but not the lysosomal enzyme Cathepsin D ( CatD ) , can be coimmunoprecipitated in cell lysates with the (cid:1) - adaptin chain recognized by the anti - (cid:1) M12A9 antibody ( Figure 1B ) . Taken together , these results demonstrate the existence of an AP - 1 complex in Dictyostelium . Intracellular Localization of the AP - 1 Complex in Dictyostelium In mammalian cells , AP - 1 is found not only in the cytosol but also in association with Golgi membranes . To establish the intracellular localization of (cid:3) 1 - containing AP complexes in Dictyostelium , membranes were fractionated on linear ( 15 – 57 % ) sucrose gradients ( Figure 1C ) . As previously reported ( Bogdanovic et al . , 2000 ) , lysosomal compartments were con - centrated in high - density fractions ( fractions 2 – 5 ) , whereas plasma membrane , contractile vacuole , and Golgi mem - branes were contained in low - density fractions ( fractions 8 – 11 ; unpublished data ) . Comitin ( p24 ) , an actin - binding protein associated with the Golgi apparatus , was previously found in two distinct fractions in sucrose gradients ( Weiner et al . , 1993 ) . As shown in Figure 1C , (cid:3) 1 cofractionated with low - density comitin ( peaking at fraction 9 ) in fractions con - taining Golgi membranes . This result was further conﬁrmed using an antibody ( mAb 1 / 39 ) against an unknown antigen speciﬁcally localized to the Golgi apparatus ( Graf et al . , 1999 ) . Indeed distribution of (cid:3) 1 on sucrose gradient was similar to that of the protein detected by mAb 1 / 39 ( Figure 1C ) . Together , these data indicate that the AP - 1 complex is mainly associated with Golgi - enriched fractions in Dictyoste - lium . The AP - 1 localization was next examined by confocal microscopy experiments . Double immunostaining with polyclonal anti – (cid:1) - adaptin and anticomitin antibodies re - vealed that (cid:1) - adaptin and comitin ( a marker for the Golgi ) were mainly concentrated in the same Golgi area as well as in vesicular structures throughout the cytoplasm ( Figure 3A ) . The localization of AP - 1 subunits to the Golgi was also conﬁrmed by assessing the distribution of GFP - tagged (cid:1) - adaptin ( for the biochemical characterization of (cid:1) - GFP see MATERIALS AND METHODS ) . When expressed in Dictyo - stelium cells , (cid:1) - GFP localized to the Golgi area labeled with clathrin ( Figure 3A ) , suggesting that in vivo , AP - 1 subunits recruit clathrin coats . Some clathrin - coated structures did not colocalize with (cid:1) - GFP and could correspond to vesicles including other adaptor proteins . Interestingly , (cid:1) - GFP and native (cid:1) - adaptin associated with Golgi membranes were insensitive to Brefeldin A ( BFA ) , a fungal metabolite that triggers dissociation of vesicular coats ( e . g . , COP1 and AP - 1 ) from membranes of mammalian cells ( Donaldson et al . , 1990 ; Robinson and Kreis , 1992 ; Wong and Brodsky , 1992 ) . This lack of sensitivity to BFA was already reported for (cid:2) - COP in Dictyostelium cells and is likely due to the presence of a BFA resistance gene ( Mohrs et al . , 2000 ) . Disruption of the actin network using DMSO leads to the reversible fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus and the redistribution of Golgi markers ( e . g . , (cid:2) - COP ) in the cyto - plasm of mammalian and Dictyostelium cells ( Weiner et al . , 1993 ; Mohrs et al . , 2000 ) . To determine whether (cid:1) - GFP re - distributes as endogenous (cid:1) - adaptin during DMSO treat - ment in vivo , (cid:1) - GFP – expressing cells were incubated in 5 % DMSO for 0 , 20 , and 40 min , stained with a polyclonal anti – (cid:1) - adaptin antibody , and analyzed by epiﬂuorescence microscopy ( Figure 3B ) . After 20 min of treatment , both (cid:1) - GFP and endogenous (cid:1) - adaptin showed a diffuse cytosolic stain and also localized to many vesicular structures . How - ever , after 40 min , both proteins reassembled in a perinu - clear region with identical kinetics . These results demon - strate that (cid:1) - GFP and native (cid:1) - adaptin are localized to the same organelle and behave identically when cells are treated with an agent that affects Golgi integrity . Dictyostelium AP - 1 Recruits Clathrin The colocalization of (cid:1) - GFP with clathrin suggested that AP - 1 recruits clathrin coats in living cells . To assess clathrin binding of Dictyostelium (cid:1) - adaptin , we constructed GST - (cid:1) fusion proteins and assayed their ability to bind clathrin from Dictyostelium cytosol . Analysis of the protein sequence of Dictyostelium (cid:1) - adaptin revealed only one putative copy of the clathrin box motif , at position 630 ( Figure 2 ) , identiﬁed in mammalian (cid:1) chain as responsible for clathrin binding ( ter Haar et al . , 2000 ; Doray and Kornfeld , 2001 ) . Both GST - (cid:1) 592 – 896 ( hinge and appendage , with the clathrin box ) and GST - (cid:1) 663 – 896 ( appendage , without the clathrin box ) dis - played clathrin binding capacities ( Figure 3C ) . As the pres - ence of the hinge domain resulted in an enhanced recruit - ment of clathrin in pull - down experiments , the hinge and appendage domains could present independent clathrin binding domains as previously reported for mammalian (cid:1) chain ( Doray and Kornfeld , 2001 ) . Intracellular Dynamics of (cid:1) - GFP in Living Cells To determine the dynamic localization of AP - 1 in living cells , we observed the intracellular dynamics of (cid:1) - GFP – expressing cells by time - lapse confocal microscopy . The main event was the rapid movement of AP - 1 structures emerging from the Golgi area toward the cell periphery . These AP - 1 structures included vesicles but also tubules and / or queues of vesicles along a same track ( Figure 4A ) . Most AP - 1 structures rapidly disappeared when reaching their destination ( or were moving out the confocal plane ) , but in some cases , AP - 1 vesicles moved back to the Golgi following the same track ( Figure 4B ) . Together these obser - vations are consistent with the role of AP - 1 in the transport of cargo proteins from the TGN to endosomes . In addition , AP - 1 structures moving toward the TGN were also observed but at a very low frequency ( our unpublished results ) , al - Y . Lefkir et al .

Bound proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE ( 7 % gel ) and revealed by Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal anticlathrin heavy chain ( top panel ) . Similar amount of GST - (cid:1) proteins ( twice this amount for control GST ) were used in the binding assay . Molecular weights are indicated on the right ( kDa ) . Y . Lefkir et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 1840 though these events were difﬁcult to reliably quantify be - cause AP - 1 structures moving along microtubules hardly stayed in a same confocal plane and , consequently , AP - 1 structures docking to Golgi membranes could be easily over - looked . This result suggests that AP - 1 could be also impli - cated in retrograde transport between endosomes and the TGN in Dictyostelium cells as reported for mammalian and yeast cells . The (cid:2) 1 Chain Is Not Required for AP - 1 Assembly and Golgi Localization To determine the role of AP - 1 in Dictyostelium , we decided to invalidate genes encoding AP - 1 subunits . For unknown reasons , we failed to inactivate the (cid:1) - adaptin gene , and therefore the apm1 gene , encoding the (cid:3) 1 AP - 1 subunit , was disrupted by targeted integration of the blasticidin selection marker ( see MATERIALS AND METHODS ) . The (cid:3) 1 protein was not detected in mutant cells ( Figure 5A ) , whereas stable transfection of native (cid:3) 1 ( apm1 (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 ) , or (cid:3) 1 truncated by deletion of its 18 C - terminal residues ( apm1 (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct ) , restored (cid:3) 1 expression to levels com - parable to wild - type cells ( DH1 ; Figure 5A ) . The deleted domain in (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct corresponds to a region in murine (cid:3) 2 required for the interaction between (cid:3) chains and ty - rosine - based signals ( Owen and Evans , 1998 ) . This trun - cated (cid:3) 1 chain was unable to bind mammalian tyrosine signals in a yeast two - hybrid assay ( our unpublished results ) . Therefore the (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct construct was used hereafter to determine whether the observed defects in mutant apm1 (cid:4) cells were due to the absence of a functional (cid:3) 1 subunit or to any aberrant functions of partial AP - 1 com - plexes deprived of (cid:3) 1 chains . To determine the structure of AP - 1 complexes in mutant apm1 (cid:4) cells , cytosol was fractionated by gel ﬁltration and fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti – (cid:1) - adaptin antibody . In contrast to wild - type cells , (cid:1) - adaptin from apm1 (cid:4) cytosol was detected in fractions 20 – 26 , peaking at fraction 22 , which corresponds to an apparent size of (cid:7) 250 kDa ( Figure 5B ) . Therefore AP - 1 subunits are able to assemble without (cid:3) 1 chains . A characteristic of AP complexes is to cycle between cy - tosolic and membrane - bound pools . To evaluate whether AP - 1 complexes without (cid:3) 1 chains partitioned into cytosolic and membrane fractions as native AP - 1 , we determined the relative amount of (cid:1) - adaptin in cytosol ( C ) and total mem - brane ( M ) fractions prepared by centrifugation . In wild - type cells , 87 % of total cellular (cid:1) - adaptin associated with mem - branes , whereas only 52 % was detected in membranes of apm1 (cid:4) mutant cell ( Figure 5C ) . We next assessed the intra - cellular localization of AP - 1 partial complexes in apm1 (cid:4) cells . As observed in Figure 5D , (cid:1) - adaptin was detected in the Golgi area of apm1 (cid:4) , apm1 (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct and wild - type cells . Taking together these results demonstrate that (cid:3) 1 is not essential for speciﬁc recruitment of AP - 1 to Golgi mem - branes in Dictyostelium cells but participates in membrane binding efﬁciency .

Expres - sion of native (cid:3) 1 , but not of (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct , in apm1 (cid:4) cells reverted the growth defect . In old cultures , some giant cells with 3 – 5 nuclei per cell appeared , suggesting cytokinesis defects in this mutant . On nutrient depletion , Dictyostelium cells aggregate and proceed to a developmental cycle leading to the formation of fruiting bodies . Previous studies on clathrin heavy - chain null mutants ( chc (cid:4) ) revealed the important role played by clathrin during Dictyostelium development ( Niswonger and O’Halloran , 1997 ) . chc (cid:4) cells are delayed in early develop - Figure 5 .

Cell lysates from wild - type ( DH1 ) , (cid:3) 1 - deleted ( apm1 (cid:4) ) , and mutant cells stably transfected with native (cid:3) 1 ( apm1 (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 ) or truncated (cid:3) 1 ( apm1 (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct ) were immunoprecipitated with the anti – (cid:1) - adaptin antibody and analyzed by Western blotting using the anti - (cid:3) 1 rabbit antiserum .

Dictyostelium cytosol from wild - type ( E ) and apm1 (cid:4) cells ( F ) was fractionated on a Sephacryl S - 300 HR gel ﬁltration column . Frac - tions were collected and proteins were analyzed by Western blot - ting using the anti – (cid:1) - adaptin mAb M12A9 . In mutant apm1 (cid:4) cells , (cid:1) - adaptin was detected in fractions 20 – 26 , peaking at fraction 22 , which corresponds to an apparent size of (cid:7) 250 kDa . ( C ) Analysis of the association of (cid:1) - adaptin with membranes . The indicated cell lines were lysed in breaking buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , pH7 ; 200 mM sucrose ; 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 ; 15 mM KCl ; 1 mM EDTA ; 1 mM DTT ) as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS . Membranes ( M ) and cytosol ( C ) were separated by centrifugation at 100 , 000 (cid:2) g for 1 h . The presence of (cid:1) was detected by Western blotting using the anti – (cid:1) - adaptin mAb M12A9 , quantiﬁed , and expressed as the per - centage of total (cid:1) - adaptin in both fractions . AP - 1 complexes without (cid:3) 1 chains show a reduced binding to membrane compared with native AP - 1 . ( D ) Intracellular localization of (cid:1) - adaptin in apm1 (cid:4) cells . The indicated cell lines were ﬁxed , incubated with the anti – (cid:1) - adaptin polyclonal rabbit antiserum , and stained with a Cy3 anti - rabbit secondary antibody . Bar , 5 (cid:3) M Figure 6 . Growth and development of apm1 (cid:4) cells . ( A ) apm1 (cid:4) cells have a growth defect when fed upon bacteria . To assess growth on bacteria , cells were plated onto Klebsiella aerogenes lawns and Dictyostelium colonies were observed 7 d later . ( B ) Cells were grown axenically at 22°C without shaking . Growth was measured by cell counting using a hemocytometer . apm1 (cid:4) mutant ( F ) and apm1 (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct ( Œ ) cells grow slower than wild - type ( E ) and apm1 (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 ( ‚ ) cells . ( C ) The kinetics of development of the apm1 (cid:4) mutant is delayed . For development analysis , cells were plated on 0 . 45 - (cid:3) m membrane ﬁlters laid on Na / K phosphate buffer and incubated at 24°C in humid chambers for the indicated periods of time . Although after 29 h the development of wild - type cells was complete , apm1 (cid:4) cells showed ﬁnger - like structures . After 44 h of development , fruiting body - like structures appeared , though the stalks were very thin in comparison to wild - type structures . Y . Lefkir et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 1842 ment and fail to produce any spores . To evaluate the role of AP - 1 in development , mutant cells were layered onto ﬁlters soaked with Na / K phosphate buffer . In contrast to chc (cid:4) cells , the early stages of development in apm1 (cid:4) cells ( e . g . , aggregation ) were normal as well as the morphology of each developmental step ( our unpublished results ) . However , the overall kinetics of development was delayed ( Figure 6C ) . After 29 h , although development of wild - type cells was complete , apm1 (cid:4) cells showed ﬁnger - like structures . After 44 h of development , fruiting body - like structures appeared , though the stalks were very thin in comparison to wild - type structures . Interestingly , in HL5 medium , only 10 % of mu - tant spores germinated and gave rise to amoeba compared with 70 % for control spores . Stable transfection of native (cid:3) 1 complemented both growth and developmental defects . However , (cid:3) 1 truncated of the 18 C - terminal residues ( (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct ) did not restore these functions ( our unpublished results ) . Thus , in Dictyostelium , AP - 1 seems to be important for cell growth , development , and spore germination . Notably , the (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct did not rescue any defects establishing that the ab - sence of a fully functional (cid:3) 1 chain accounts for the ob - served phenotypes in apm1 (cid:4) cells . Lysosomal Enzyme Precursors Are Secreted in apm1 (cid:3) Cells In mammalian cells , AP - 1 is required for the transport of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes between the TGN and lysosomes . Accordingly , defects in lysosomal enzymes transport lead to secretion of enzyme precursor forms into the culture medium ( Le Borgne and Hoﬂack , 1998 ) . To test if AP - 1 could play a similar role in Dictyostelium , we analyzed whether the precursor forms of two lysosomal enzymes ( (cid:5) - mannosidase and cathepsin D ) could be detected in cul - ture medium from apm1 (cid:4) mutant cells . Dictyostelium (cid:5) - mannosidase is synthesized as a 140 - kDa precursor , which , upon transport to lysosomes , is processed into peptides of 60 and 58 kDa ( Mierendorf et al . , 1983 , 1985 ; Cardelli et al . , 1986 ) . In wild - type cells , no precursor form ( pro ) was detected in the culture medium after 10 h of incubation ( Figure 7A ) and most of the enzyme in the intra - cellular fraction ( P ) was found in its mature lysosomal form ( mat ) . In contrast , in apm1 (cid:4) cells , the (cid:5) - mannosidase precur - sor was detected in the culture medium ( 48 % of total en - zyme secreted after 10 h ) and less mature form ( mat ) accu - mulated relative to the amount of secreted precursor ( Figure 7A ) . Complementation of mutant cells with native (cid:3) 1 , but not with (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct ( 38 % of enzyme secreted after 10 h ) , reverted this phenotype , although more intracellular mature form was detected in apm1 (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct than in apm1 (cid:4) cells , sug - gesting that (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct could partially restore AP - 1 sorting func - tions . The fate of cathepsin D , another lysosomal enzyme , was also assayed and identical maturation and secretion defects were observed ( our unpublished results ) . These results demonstrate that AP - 1 is required for the targeting of two lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes , indicating that Dictyostelium and mammalian AP - 1 adaptor complexes share similar functions . To exclude the possibility that apm1 (cid:4) mutant cells display a general membrane trafﬁcking defect , we analyzed the internalization rate of a cell surface transmembrane protein ( p80 ) known to be constitutively internalized ( Ravanel et al . , 2001 ) . Wild - type cells showed (cid:7) 80 % of p80 endocytosis after 30 min monitored by ﬂow cytometry , and the rate of endocytosis was similar in apm1 (cid:4) cells ( our unpublished results ) , excluding a major defect in membrane protein endocytosis in mutant cells . Endocytic Compartments in apm1 (cid:3) Cells As the transport of lysosomal components is impaired in apm1 (cid:4) cells , the apm1 (cid:4) deletion could also affect the overall biogenesis and / or morphology of the endocytic compart - ments . To assess this possibility , we analyzed the intracellular distribution of a transmembrane endosomal protein , p80 , in wild - type and mutant cells . The p80 protein is present at the cell surface but also throughout the endocytic pathway . As previously described ( Ravanel et al . , 2001 ) , in wild - type cells , p80 was detected in early endocytic compartments ( character - ized by a low concentration of p80 ) and also in late endocytic compartments ( characterized by a high concentration of p80 ; Figure 7B ) . In apm1 (cid:4) cells , p80 was similarly distributed in endocytic compartments with high and low p80 content . How - ever , although this marker was normal in location , the size of these endocytic compartments appeared smaller and the num - ber of vacuole structures was signiﬁcantly increased ( Figure 7B ) . To demonstrate that these morphological defects were not restricted to p80 - containing vacuoles , cells were allowed to internalize the ﬂuid - phase marker FITC - dextran for 60 min to label all endocytic compartments and analyzed by epiﬂuores - cence microscopy . In these conditions , identical defects in size and number of vacuoles were observed and the expression of (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct in apm1 (cid:4) cells did not restore the wild - type phenotype ( Figure 7C ) . Electron microscopy analysis further conﬁrmed these results . In contrast to wild - type cells that displayed sev - eral large vacuoles , apm1 (cid:4) cells displayed only one or two medium - size vacuoles surrounded by many small vacuoles ( Figure 8 ) . Finally the localization of two other endosomal markers , the actin binding protein coronin ( early and late en - dosomes ) and the coat protein vacuolin ( postlysosomal vacu - oles ) , was also found identical in apm1 (cid:4) and wild - type cells ( Figure 7B and our unpublished results ) . Therefore , apm1 (cid:4) mutant cells present a normal organization of the endocytic pathway but an altered morphology of endocytic organelles . AP - 1 Is Required for Transport of Proteins to the Contractile Vacuole Complex To live in hypo - osmotic condition , Dictyostelium cells have developed a specialized compartment , the contractile vacu - ole complex ( CV ) . This osmoregulatory organelle is com - posed of large cisternae ( bladder ) and interconnecting ducts . The cisternae fuse periodically with the plasma membrane to expel water from the cells . Because clathrin - deﬁcient cells display osmoregulatory defects and the CV complex is miss - ing ( O’ Halloran and Anderson , 1992 ) , we ﬁrst assayed the function of the CV complex in apm1 (cid:4) mutant cells . Wild - type and mutant cells were shifted from culture medium to water and observed (cid:1) 30 min . Rapidly , both cell types swelled and rounded up because of water import . Although wild - type cells rapidly adjusted to the osmotic stress and returned to their original shape , apm1 (cid:4) mutant cells stayed swollen ( Figure 9 ) . The expression of native (cid:3) 1 , but not of (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct , allowed apm1 (cid:4) mutant cells to regain the ability to adjust to osmotic stress ( Figure 9 ) . Dictyostelium AP - 1 Vol . 14 , May 2003 1843 Next we examined the integrity of the CV complex by studying the localization of two CV resident proteins , Rh50 ( Dictyostelium rhesus protein ; Benghezal et al . , 2001 ) and VatA ( a subunit of the peripheral vacuolar - H (cid:3) - ATPase V1 domain ; Zhu and Clarke , 1992 ; Jenne et al . , 1998 ; Neuhaus et al . , 1998 ; de Hostos , 1999 ) in apm1 (cid:4) mutant cells . In wild - type and apm1 (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 cells , Rh50 localized exclusively to the CV network , whereas VatA was mainly present in the CV network but also was detected in early endosomes . In contrast , Rh50 and VatA did not colocalized to the CV network in apm1 (cid:4) and apm1 (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct mutant cells ( Figure 10A ) . Instead , Rh50 was mainly found on punctuate structures in the Golgi area stained with the anticomitin antibody , whereas VatA was mainly detected in vacuoles , which were likely endo - somes because they contained p80 ( Figure 10B ) . In addition , Cal - modulin , another CV component ( Ultricht and Soldati , 1999 ) , also redistributed in endosomes in apm1 (cid:4) cells , and the characteristic CV network was not detected in apm1 (cid:4) mutant cells incubated with FM 4 – 64 ( a ﬂuorescent dye known to label the CV complex ; our unpublished results ) . Thus , no recognizable CV network can be detected in apm1 (cid:4) cells , although it is not clear whether Rh50 - Figure 7 . The transport of lysoso - mal enzymes is defective in apm1 (cid:4) cells . ( A ) Secretion of the (cid:5) - mannosi - dase immature precursor . Wild - type ( DH1 ) , apm1 (cid:4) mutant ( apm1 (cid:4) ) , and mutant cells stably transfected with native (cid:3) 1 ( apm1 (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 ) or truncated (cid:3) 1 ( apm1 (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct ) were resus - pended in HL5 at 5 (cid:2) 10 6 cells / ml and incubated at 22°C on a rotating wheel . After 10 h , cells were centri - fuged , and supernatants ( S ) and cell pellets ( P ) wereanalyzedbyWestern blotting . Inwild - typecells , (cid:5) - manno - sidase is synthesized as a 140 - kDa precursor ( pro ) which , when trans - ported to lysosomes , is processed into peptides of 60 and 58 kDa ( mat ) not separated on this gel . Although no precursor is secreted in DH1 or apm1 (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:3) 1cells , the (cid:5) - mannosidase precursorwassecretedin apm1 (cid:4) and apm1 (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct cells . ( B ) p80 is cor - rectly distributed in endocytic com - partments of apm1 (cid:4) cells . Methanol ﬁxed wild - type ( DH1 ) , apm1 (cid:4) mu - tant ( apm1 (cid:4) ) cells were stained with an anticoronin antibody ( 176 - 2 - 5 ) , followed by an Alexa Fluor 568 anti - mouse secondary antibody and ﬁ - nally incubated with the anti - p80 an - tibody ( H161 ) directly coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 . Arrows indicate vacuoles with high content of p80 and displaying coronin . p80 and co - ronin are correctly distributed in all endocytic compartments . However , the size of these compartments ap - pearssmallerandthenumberofvac - uole structures is signiﬁcantly in - creased in apm1 (cid:4) mutant cells . Bars , 5 (cid:3) M .

In these conditions , apm1 (cid:4) and apm1 (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct cells show identical defects in the size and the number of vacuoles . Bars , 5 (cid:3) M . Y . Lefkir et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 1844 positive structures correspond to altered nonfunctional contractile vacuoles or to mislocalized Rh50 , for instance to the Golgi appa - ratus . The absence of functional CV and the mis - localization of CV components suggested that the morphology of the CV complexes was altered in apm1 (cid:4) mutant cells . In electron microscopy images , CV appears as large translucent vacu - oles ( Chastellier et al . , 1978 ; Quiviger et al . , 1978 ) . Electron microscopy analysis of thin section series of apm1 (cid:4) mutant cells did not reveal the presence of large vacuoles character - istic of CV organelles ( Figure 8 ) . DISCUSSION In this study , we report the function of a clathrin - associated complex in the model organism Dictyostelium discoideum . We Figure 8 . Ultrastructure of endocytic compart - ments in mutant apm1 (cid:4) cells . Thin sections elec - tron microscopy analysis of wild - type ( A ) and apm1 (cid:4) ( B ) cells reveals that mutant cells display only one or two medium - size vacuoles sur - rounded by small vacuoles in contrast to wild - type cells containing several large vacuoles . The arrow indicates a translucent vacuole likely to correspond to a contractile vacuole . Bars , 1 (cid:3) M Dictyostelium AP - 1 Vol . 14 , May 2003 1845 focused on AP - 1 which , in mammalian cells , is most impli - cated in transport from the TGN to endocytic compartments . We made the molecular characterization of Dictyostelium AP - 1 and showed that this complex displays similar com - position , localization , and dynamics than mammalian AP - 1 complexes . Taking advantage of Dictyostelium genetic tools , we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that the deletion of one single AP subunit , (cid:3) 1 , results in strong phenotypes , includ - ing defects in basic cell functions and in several clathrin - dependent transport pathways . We provide the ﬁrst in vivo evidence that (cid:3) 1 Ct domain , which interacts with tyrosine - based sorting signals , is essential for the correct targeting of lysosomal hydrolases from the Golgi compartment to lyso - somes . Furthermore , we demonstrate that the AP - 1 coat is implicated in the biogenesis of a functional osmoregulatory organelle , the contractile vacuole . Molecular Characterization and Dynamics of Dictyostelium AP - 1 The high homology of (cid:1) - adaptin and (cid:3) 1 chains with corre - sponding mammalian AP - 1 subunits strongly suggested that these chains were subunits of a same AP - 1 complex . This assumption was conﬁrmed by showing that these chains assemble with putative (cid:2) 1 and (cid:4) 1 subunits to form in a high - molecular - weight complex of (cid:7) 300 kDa , consistent with the size of an heterotetrameric AP complex ( Figure 1A ) . Although these (cid:2) 1 and (cid:4) 1 chains were not characterized in this study , blast searches in available EST and genomic data basis indicate potential genes encoding (cid:2) 1 ( contig11712 en - coding a protein of 927 aa sharing 52 % identify and 28 % similarity with mouse (cid:2) 1 ) and (cid:4) 1 subunits ( cDNA clone SSF227 encoding a deduced protein sequence of 154 aa sharing 55 % identity and 28 % similarity with mouse (cid:4) 1 ) . The identiﬁcation of this AP complex as Dictyostelium AP - 1 was further established by studying its intracellular localization . Subcellular fractionation studies indicate that the AP - 1 complex is mainly associated with Golgi - enriched fractions ( Figure 1C ) . Confocal microscopy analyses show that AP - 1 is concentrated in the Golgi area ( Figure 3A ) as well as vesicular structures . Finally , a (cid:1) - GFP fusion protein expressed in Dictyostelium cells localizes to this same perinu - clear region ( Figure 3A ) , which undergoes a reversible frag - mentation when cells are treated with DMSO , an agent that affects Golgi integrity ( Figure 3B ) . Therefore the intracellular localization of AP - 1 in Dictyostelium is similar to that ob - served for mammalian AP - 1 complexes ( Robinson , 1989 ) . In mammalian and yeast cells , AP - 1 has been reported to be involved in retrograde ( endosomes to TGN ) transport of several proteins ( Zizioli et al . , 1999 ; Meyer et al . , 2000 ; Valdivia et al . , 2002 ) . However , live microscopy studies of cells expressing YFP - tagged - (cid:3) 1A chains indicates that AP - 1 – coated structure moving toward the TGN are hardly ob - served ( Huang et al . , 2001 ) , thus leaving open the debate on the transport pathway in which operate AP - 1 complexes . The incorporation of a functional (cid:1) - GFP protein into AP - 1 complexes allowed us to examine the dynamics of the AP - 1 coat in Dictyostelium living cells . As described in mammalian cells ( Huang et al . , 2001 ) , AP - 1 labeled with (cid:1) - GFP is de - tected in vesicles , spherical and tubular structures moving along a same track from the TGN to the cell periphery and very rarely toward the TGN . Therefore the main function of AP - 1 in Dictyostelium appears to be in anterograde ( TGN to endosomes ) transport . Surprisingly , we also detected vesi - cles moving back and forth between TGN and endosomes . This observation suggests that AP - 1 vesicles could rapidly deliver cargo proteins to endosomal compartments without fusion between vesicles and endosomes and the loss of vesicles integrity . Alternatively , this movement could reﬂect the Golgi dynamics , which has been reported to varied between a compact organization and a dispersed structure accompanied by fast protrusions of Golgi tubules and vesi - cles ( Schneider et al . , 2000 ) . Further studies will be required to test these hypotheses . An essential feature of AP - 1 complexes in all species is to facilitate the recruitment of cytosolic clathrin onto nascent vesicles . This process occurs through a direct interaction between clathrin and sequences in the hinge domains of (cid:2) 1 and (cid:1) - adaptin ( Shih et al . , 1995 ; ter Haar et al . , 2000 ; Doray and Kornfeld , 2001 ) . As expected , immunoﬂuorescence mi - croscopy studies in Dictyostelium cells establish that (cid:1) - adap - tin mainly localizes to clathrin - coated vesicles ( Figure 3A ) . Furthermore , GST - (cid:1) fusion proteins comprised of either the hinge and appendage domains or only the appendage re - gion displayed clathrin - binding abilities ( Figure 3C ) as re - ported for mammalian (cid:1) subunit of AP - 1 ( Doray and Korn - feld , 2001 ) . Taken together , these results support the conclusion that we have identiﬁed a bona ﬁde AP - 1 complex in Dictyostelium with features comparable to that of mam - malian AP - 1 . Dictyostelium , A Model Organism To Study the Function of AP - 1 Yeast genetic studies aimed at understanding the function of AP - 1 have been hindered by the absence of major trafﬁcking defects in (cid:3) 1 - deleted strains ( Stepp et al . , 1995 ) . On the contrary , deletions of (cid:3) 1A and (cid:1) chains in mice lead to embryonic lethality , also preventing functional analysis of AP - 1 in vivo ( Zizioli et al . , 1999 ; Meyer et al . , 2000 ) . To overcome this problem , we took advantage of the molecular Figure 9 . Mutant apm1 (cid:4) cells display osmoregulatory defects . Wild - type ( DH1 ) and mutant cells were shifted from culture me - dium ( HL5 ) to water and observed after 30 min by contrast - phase microscopy . Rapidly , both cell types swelled and rounded up be - cause of water import . While wild - type cells rapidly adjusted to the osmotic stress and returned to their original shape , apm1 (cid:4) mutant cells stayed swollen because of water import . The expression of native (cid:3) 1 ( apm1 (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 ) but not of (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct ( apm1 (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct ) allows apm1 (cid:4) mutant cells to regain their normal shape .

In wild - type and apm1 (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 cells , Rh50 and VatA colocalize to the CV , whereas in apm1 (cid:4) and apm1 (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) Ct cells , Rh50 and VatA are not detected in the CV network . ( B ) apm1 (cid:4) mutant cells were dou - ble - labeled with combinations of the indicated antibodies . Anti - Rh 50 ( rabbit polyclonal ) , anti - VatA ( mAb 221 - 35 - 2 ) , anti - p80 ( H161 coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 ) , and anticomitin ( mAb 190 - 68 - 1 ) fol - lowed by the appropriate second - ary antibodies ( Alexa Fluor 488 anti - mouse , Alexa Fluor 568 anti - mouse , and Cy3 anti - rabbit anti - bodies ) . In contrast to wild - type cells , in apm1 (cid:4) cells Rh50 mainly colocalizes with comitin and VatA is detected in p80 - contain - ing endosomes . Bars , 5 (cid:3) M . Dictyostelium AP - 1 Vol . 14 , May 2003 1847 characterization of AP - 1 in Dictyostelium and of the molec - ular genetic techniques well developed in this model organ - ism . The apm1 gene , encoding Dictyostelium (cid:3) 1 chain , was disrupted by inserting a blasticidin resistance marker gene . In contrast to yeast cells and mice , apm1 deletion results in viable cells with several phenotypic alterations , indicating that Dictyostelium is a unique and valuable model to study the function of AP - 1 in vivo . (cid:2) 1 Is Not Required for AP - 1 Subunits Assembly and Membrane Recruitment In apm1 (cid:4) mutant cells , other AP - 1 subunits are still able to form partial AP - 1 complexes ( Figure 5B ) , which are correctly localized to the Golgi apparatus ( Figure 5D ) . These results demonstrate that (cid:3) 1 is dispensable for the speciﬁc docking of AP - 1 to Golgi membranes . However , these partial com - plexes are less stably associated with membranes because only 52 % of total (cid:1) - adaptin are detected in membranes prepared from apm1 (cid:4) mutant cells compared with 87 % for wild - type cells ( Figure 5C ) . Because AP (cid:3) chains are in - volved in the recognition of tyrosine - based signals found on transported proteins , our results demonstrate that the rec - ognition of cargo proteins by (cid:3) 1 chains is not necessary for membrane recruitment of AP - 1 in Dictyostelium cells but contributes to the efﬁciency or / and the stability of the inter - action . How is AP - 1 deprived of (cid:3) 1 subunit still targeted to the right compartment ? One possibility is that another AP - 1 subunit ( e . g . , (cid:2) 1 ) could also participate in the recognition of cargo proteins and therefore this interaction could be sufﬁ - cient for speciﬁc binding of partial AP - 1 complexes to Golgi membranes . On the other hand , determinants responsible for membrane localization of APs have been identiﬁed in (cid:5) and (cid:1) chains of AP - 2 and AP - 1 complexes , respectively ( Page and Robinson , 1995 ) . More recently , AP - 2 complexes have been shown to interact with phosphoinositides through two phospholipid binding domains in the (cid:5) chain and the surface of (cid:3) 2 Ct domain ( Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ; Collins et al . , 2002 ; Rohde et al . , 2002 ) . Sequence alignment of (cid:5) and (cid:3) 2 with AP - 1 (cid:1) and (cid:3) 1 , respectively , indicates that AP - 1 could also bind phospholipids ( Collins et al . , 2002 ) . Accordingly , the recognition of Golgi speciﬁc phospholipids by (cid:1) - adaptin could be sufﬁcient for membrane binding of partial AP - 1 complexes in apm1 (cid:4) cells . This hypothesis is in agreement with the ﬁnding that AP - 1 can be recruited in an ARF - 1 dependent manner to protein - free soybean liposomes ( Zhu et al . , 1999 ) . However , the presence of peptides con - taining tyrosine - based signals in liposomes clearly enhances AP - 1 recruitment to soybean liposomes , indicating that cargo proteins are also involved in AP - 1 recruitment ( Crottet et al . , 2002 ) . Our results are in agreement with these in vitro studies because native AP - 1 associates with membranes more efﬁciently than AP - 1 complexes without (cid:3) 1 chains ( Figure 5C ) . Notably , AP - 1 complexes deprived of mouse (cid:3) 1A subunits do not associate with membranes ( Meyer et al . , 2000 ) suggesting that in mammalian cells , lipid and cargo interactions through other AP - 1 subunits are not sufﬁcient for the recruitment of partial AP - 1 complexes to Golgi mem - branes . This discrepancy between Dictyostelium and mam - malian AP - 1 complexes could reﬂect their respective afﬁnity for sorting signals and membrane lipids between species . (cid:2) 1 Deletion Affects AP - 1 and Clathrin Functions Clathrin heavy chain null mutant in Dictyostelium ( chc (cid:4) mutant ) displays pleiotropic defects , including growth and developmental defects , as well as the inhibition of several transport events along the endocytic pathway ( O’Halloran and Anderson , 1992 ; Ruscetti et al . , 1994 ; Niswonger and O’Halloran , 1997 ) . Clathrin is known to be recruited by several proteins at different intracellular locations , prevent - ing thus to analyze the precise role of clathrin - coated struc - tures in any individual transport pathway . Our study allows for the ﬁrst time to ascribe some defects observed in chc (cid:4) mutant cells to the AP - 1 adaptor complex . As reported for chc (cid:4) cells , apm1 (cid:4) cells are viable but grow slower than wild - type cells ( Figure 6 , A and B ) . In addition , mutant cells show a much weaker defect in Dictyostelium development compared with chc (cid:4) cells , suggesting that other clathrin - associated coats are involved in Dictyostelium development . The fact that Dictyostelium AP - 4 medium chain is upregulated during development reinforces this possibility ( de Chassey et al . , 2001 ) . In Dictyostelium as in mammalian cells , clathrin has been implicated in the transport of lysosomal enzymes between the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes . For instance , chc (cid:4) mu - tant cells secrete immature forms of the hydrolase , (cid:5) - man - nosidase ( Ruscetti et al . , 1994 ) . In apm1 (cid:4) cells , the precursor form of this enzyme is also secreted ( Figure 7A ) , supporting the conclusion that Dictyostelium AP - 1 is required for the transport of lysosomal enzymes from TGN to lysosomes . However , this defect is only partial because mature (cid:5) - man - nosidase is still detected intracellularly . Cell surface inter - nalization and further processing of the secreted immature precursor is likely to account for this residual mature en - zyme as reported for mannose - 6 - phosphate receptors in (cid:3) 1A deleted ﬁbroblasts ( Meyer et al . , 2000 ) . Alternatively , Dictyostelium hydrolases could be transported to lysosomes through an AP - 1 – independent mechanism , for instance through a GGA ( Golgi - localized (cid:1) - ear – containing Arf - bind - ing proteins ) mediated transport pathway as described for several proteins in other organisms ( Black and Pelham , 2000 ; Dell’Angelica et al . , 2000 ; Hirst et al . , 2000 ; Zhdankina et al . , 2001 ) . In mammalian cells , transport of lysosomal enzymes is mediated by MPRs . As MPRs have not been identiﬁed in Dictyostelium , our results suggest the existence of another lysosomal enzyme receptor whose trafﬁcking is AP - 1 depen - dent . Recently , targeted disruption of the AP - 1 (cid:3) 1A gene in mice has revealed that AP - 1 may act in MPRs retrieval from early endosomes to the TGN ( Meyer et al . , 2000 ) . This re - trieval function was also described in yeast , where the dis - ruption of the (cid:3) 1 gene inhibits Golgi retrieval of chitin synthase III and syntaxin Tlg1p ( Valdivia et al . , 2002 ) . Our data in Dictyostelium are consistent with the role of AP - 1 in this endosomes to TGN retrograde pathway , because a block in recycling of MPR like receptor would also lead to a general defect in lysosomal enzyme targeting . However , the Golgi steady state localization of AP - 1 and the fact that AP - 1 – coated structures moving toward the Golgi area are hardly observed suggest that in Dictyostelium , AP - 1 is mainly involved in sorting putative MPR - like proteins at the TGN level . The reason for this discrepancy is unknown . Studies on other clathrin - dependent transport processes from the TGN could provide missing clues . Y . Lefkir et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 1848 The morphology of the endocytic pathway is affected both in apm1 (cid:4) and chc (cid:4) cells . Despite of lysosomal enzyme tar - geting defects , apm1 (cid:4) mutant cells present a normal local - ization of several other endocytic protein markers ( Figure 7B ) , suggesting that the overall organization of the endocytic pathway is not altered . In contrast , the morphology of the endocytic organelles is modiﬁed in apm1 (cid:4) as well as in chc (cid:4) cells . Conventional thin - section electron microscopy reveals the absence of large vacuoles in AP - 1 – deﬁcient cells and a higher density of small vacuoles ( Figure 8 ) . Endo - lysosomal organelles are known to undergo repeated homotypic and heteropypic fusion events , leading to the formation of big vacuoles referred to as postlysosomes or secretory lyso - somes ( Neuhaus et al . , 2002 ) . It is tempting to propose that clathrin / AP - 1 complexes could be implicated in sorting events essential for the biogenesis of late endocytic compart - ments . For instance , essential components of the fusion ma - chinery ( e . g . , SNARES ) required for speciﬁc fusion events between vacuoles could be incorrectly addressed in the ab - sence of functional AP - 1 complexes , thus preventing the formation of large vacuoles . Conversely , AP - 1 – coated vesi - cles could contribute to the constant ﬂux of membrane re - quired to establish and maintain the structure of these or - ganelles . Interestingly , apm1 (cid:4) mutant cells display a reduced rate of ﬂuid - phase endocytosis and phagocytosis ( our unpublished results ) , whereas endocytosis of a plasma membrane recep - tor is not affected . In chc (cid:4) cells , all these endocytic pathways are altered to some extent . Although receptor - mediated en - docytosis in Dictyostelium is likely to involved AP - 2 clathrin associated adaptor complexes , our results suggest that AP - 1 could play a role in pinocytosis and phagocytosis . This possibility is currently under investigation . Finally , the contractile vacuole complex , an osmoregula - tory organelle in Dictyostelium also involved in Ca 2 (cid:3) regu - lation ( Moniakis et al . , 1999 ) , is an integral compartment distinct from endosomes and the plasma membrane . Al - though endosomes and CV share common components ( Bush et al . , 1994 ; Temesvari et al . , 1996 ) , these two compart - ments are apparently not connected to each other because no protein and membrane exchanges occur ( Gabriel et al . , 1999 ; Clarke et al . , 2002 ) . Clathrin - coated vesicles have been pro - posed to play an essential role in the biogenesis of CV complexes by transporting proteins and membrane required for CV formation ( O’Halloran and Anderson , 1992 ) . Here we show for the ﬁrst time , that AP - 1 is involved in the targeting of two CV components . Rh50 , a membrane protein exclu - sively restricted to the CV network ( Benghezal et al . , 2001 ) , is mostly retained in the Golgi apparatus in AP - 1 deﬁcient cells whereas the vacuolar H (cid:3) - ATPase ( VatA ) is routed to endo - somes , its other physiological localization ( Figure 10 ) . Tar - geting defects of these CV components correlate with the absence of functional and morphologically detectable CV complexes ( Figures 8 and 9 ) . Together these results suggest that AP - 1 is implicated in the biogenesis of the CV complex . In conclusion , our study demonstrates that the genetically tractable model organism , D . discoideum , is a valuable model for studying the function of AP vesicular coat proteins in vivo . Further genetic approaches are now being used to identify additional components implicated in the AP - 1 – de - pendent transport machinery . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank A .
