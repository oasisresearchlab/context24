ORIGINAL ARTICLE Loss of PTEN induces microtentacles through PI3K - independent activation of coﬁlin MI Vitolo 1 , AE Boggs 1 , 2 , RA Whipple 1 , JR Yoon 1 , 2 , K Thompson 1 , MA Matrone 3 , EH Cho 4 , EM Balzer 5 and SS Martin 1 , 2 , 6 Loss of PTEN tumor suppressor enhances metastatic risk in breast cancer , although the underlying mechanisms are poorly deﬁned . We report that homozygous deletion of PTEN in mammary epithelial cells induces tubulin - based microtentacles ( McTNs ) that facilitate cell reattachment and homotypic aggregation . Treatment with contractility - modulating drugs showed that McTNs in PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells are suppressible by controlling the actin cytoskeleton . Because outward microtubule extension is counteracted by actin cortical contraction , increased activity of actin - severing proteins could release constraints on McTN formation in PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells . One such actin - severing protein , coﬁlin , is activated in detached PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells that could weaken the actin cortex to promote McTNs . Expression of wild - type coﬁlin , an activated mutant ( S3A ) , and an inactive mutant ( S3E ) demonstrated that altering coﬁlin phosphorylation directly affects McTNs formation . Chemical inhibition of PI3K did not reduce McTNs or inactivate coﬁlin in PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells . Additionally , knock - in expression of the two most common PI3K - activating mutations observed in human cancer patients did not increase McTNs or activate coﬁlin . PTEN loss and PI3K activation also caused differential activation of the coﬁlin regulators , LIM - kinase1 ( LIMK ) and Slingshot - 1L ( SSH ) . Furthermore , McTNs were suppressed and coﬁlin was inactivated by restoration of PTEN in the PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells , indicating that both the elevation of McTNs and the activation of coﬁlin are speciﬁc results arising from PTEN loss . These data identify a novel mechanism by which PTEN loss could remodel the cortical actin network to facilitate McTNs that promote tumor cell reattachment and aggregation . Using isogenic MCF - 10A PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) and PIK3CA mutants , we have further demonstrated that there are clear differences in activation of coﬁlin , LIMK and SSH between PTEN loss and PI3K activation , providing a new evidence that these mutations yield distinct cytoskeletal phenotypes , which could have an impact on tumor biology .

We have previously shown that MECs extend long dynamic microtubule - based protrusions of the plasma membrane , termed microtentacles ( McTNs ) . McTNs are induced by ECM detachment , structurally distinct from classical actin - based extensions of adherent cells 5 and persist for days in breast tumor lines that are resistant to anoikis . 6 , 7 Although traditional studies of tumor dormancy have established the notion that solitary disseminated tumor cells undergo extended periods of inactivity during mitotic quiescence , 8 our ﬁndings indicate that detached cells continue to actively respond to the microenvironment via cytoskeletal rearrangement and McTNs without requiring active cell growth . Metastatic breast tumor cells often display abnormalities in actin cytoskeletal organization compared with their non - tumori - genic counterparts . 9 – 12 Normal cells counteract the expansion of microtubules with inward tension from the actin cortex to control cell morphology . However , altering the balance between microtubules and actin has serious implications for circulating tumor cell ( CTC ) dissemination , as metastatically efﬁcient CTCs can avoid shear - induced fragmentation by undergoing sphere - to - cylinder shape transformations within capillaries . 13 PTEN can inﬂuence actin organization through dephosphorylation of its lipid substrate phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( PIP 3 ) to yield phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) . Using homologous recombination , we engineered a homozygous deletion in PTEN in MCF - 10A human MECs . 14 These PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells have an increase in the PIP 3 : PIP 2 ratio compared with the MCF - 10A parental cells , which has been veriﬁed by mass spectrometry . 15 Both phosphoinositide lipids are important regulators of the actin cytoskeleton . PIP 2 directly binds actin - associated proteins to tether the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane or activates proteins that are involved in the initiation of de novo actin polymerization ( for example , vinculin , proﬁlin and 1 University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum NCI Cancer Center , Baltimore , MD , USA ; 2 Program in Molecular Medicine , University of Maryland Graduate Program in Life Sciences , Baltimore , MD , USA ; 3 Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine , The Scripps Research Institute , La Jolla , CA , USA ; 4 Department of Cell Biology , The Scripps Research Institute , La Jolla , CA , USA ; 5 Johns Hopkins Institute for NanoBioTechnology , Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , MD , USA and 6 Department of Physiology , University of Maryland School of Medicine , Baltimore , MD , USA .

Coﬁlin is an actin - severing protein that promotes the dissocia - tion of G - actin from the minus end of F - actin and is activated by dephosphorylation . Coﬁlin – PIP 2 binding is believed to abrogate the afﬁnity of coﬁlin for actin . 21 , 22 It is possible that the reduced PIP 2 in the PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells could yield more coﬁlin available to bind actin . By decreasing the ability to counteract PI3K - driven increases in PIP 3 , PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells could also undergo greater actin rearrangement . In this study , we have determined that the loss of PTEN expression in MECs enhances the formation of long , dynamic McTNs following ECM detachment . By manipulating cellular contractility , we further established that these tubulin - based McTNs promote cell attachment . The actin - severing protein , coﬁlin , was more highly activated in the PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells , providing a mechanism for greater McTN formation . However , neither the McTN increase nor the coﬁlin activation was dependent on activation of PI3K or Akt . Patient - derived PI3K mutations were also unable to induce McTNs or coﬁlin activation . These ﬁndings reveal that PTEN loss has a further ability to both induce McTNs and rescue cells from apoptosis , 14 producing a unique phenotype that could facilitate tumor - cell metastasis by rendering epithelial cells insensitive to ECM detachment while simultaneously increasing epithelial reattachment responses . RESULTS PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) MECs produce more McTNs We have previously evaluated the production of tubulin - based McTNs in a panel of human breast tumor cell lines . 23 Detachment of the invasive cell lines SUM - 149 , Hs578t , HCC1395 and MDA - MB - 436 yields McTNs that are longer and more numerous compared with noninvasive ZR - 75 - 1 , Bt - 20 , SkBr3 and MDA - MB - 468 lines , which display relatively short and rigid McTNs . Interestingly , most of these breast cancer ( BC ) cell lines have either already lost PTEN expression or harbor the reciprocal PI3K - activating mutations and are not suitable for studying PTEN loss in human breast epithelial cells ( Supplementary Table T1 ) . PTEN loss can be more clearly addressed in the isogenic MCF - 10A background without compli - cation from the numerous other genetic differences in this panel of breast tumor cell lines . To determine whether the absence of PTEN expression is sufﬁcient to alter McTNs , parental MCF - 10A and PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) clones were evaluated for McTN production . Each of the three PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) clones exhibited double the amount of cells forming McTNs compared with their isogenic PTEN - expressing counterparts ( Figure 1a ) . Immunoﬂuorescence staining conﬁrmed the presence of a - tubulin within these McTN protrusions ( Figure 1b ) . Cell attachment and homotypic aggregation are increased by PTEN deletion To assess the effect of McTN induction in PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells , cell adherence was measured by real - time changes in electrical impedance as cells attached to microwells with integrated electrodes . This impedance measurement was then normalized to parental MCF - 10A cells to calculate relative attachment curves . Within the ﬁrst hour , initial adhesion was elevated in each of the PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cell clones , which attached over two - fold more rapidly than the MCF - 10A parental cells ( Figure 2a ; raw data , Supplementary Figure S1 ) . Increased cellular aggregation correlates with an elevated metastatic potential in vivo , 24 so we sought to examine the inﬂuence of PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) - induced McTNs on homotypic cell – cell binding . When suspended , PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells start aggregating within 6h , whereas the MCF - 10A cells remained as individual cells . By 24h , the PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells formed distinct spheroid clusters ( Figure 2b ) . Flow cytometry conﬁrmed that after 24 h , the MCF - 10A and PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells are viable and arrested in G1 ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) , indicating that the spheroid clusters of PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells arise from cell aggregation rather than division . Time - lapse ﬂuorescence microscopy of live cells expressing membrane - targeted green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) has illu - strated that McTNs promote aggregation by encircling neighbor - ing cells . 7 , 25 Mixing PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells differentially labeled with red and green ﬂuorescent membrane probes further demonstrated this cell - wrapping phenomenon with epiﬂuorescence ( Figure 2c ) and confocal microscopy ( Figure 2d ) . Attenuating actomyosin contractility increases McTN production and cell reattachment Current evidence supports a model where the balance between the expansive force of polymerizing microtubules and inward force of the actin cortex regulates McTN protrusion from the cell surface . 25 Accordingly , microtubule stabilization enhances the prevalence of McTNs on detached epithelial cells . 7 , 23 , 26 , 27 McTNs are supported by coordination of the intermediate ﬁlament protein , vimentin and stable posttranslational modiﬁed forms of a - tubulin ( Glu - tubulin ) . 23 However , neither vimentin nor Glu - tubulin levels were affected by deletion of PTEN ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . Therefore , we investigated the potential role of the actin cytoskeleton on McTN formation in response to PTEN deletion . Small - molecule inhibitors were used to examine the role of non - muscle myosin II , which has a fundamental role in cell shape , movement and contractile activity by regulating the actin cytoskeleton . 28 Blebbistatin binds to the myosin – ADP – Pi complex to interfere with phosphate release , thus blocking myosin in a functionally inactive , actin - detached state , paralyzing the motor activity of non - muscle myosin II . 29 The myosin head is unable to contact actin and perform its ‘power stroke , ’ resulting in a weakened actin cortex . The decrease in cellular contractility induced by blebbistatin elevated McTNs three - fold in MCF - 10A parental cells and two - fold in PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells ( Figure 3a ) . The presence of tubulin within the protrusions conﬁrmed their McTN identity ( Figure 3b ) . This result suggests that decreasing tension in the actin cortex results in the outward expansion of microtubules during McTN extension . 30 ML - 7 is a myosin light chain kinase ( MLCK ) inhibitor that prevents MLCK from phosphorylating MLC , thus decreasing NMII’s ATPase activity and inhibiting contraction . 31 ML - 7 was also expected to greatly reduce cortical tension and contractility , thereby increasing McTN formation . Surprisingly , McTN production was completely abolished by ML - 7 treatment ( Figures 3a and c ) . MCF - 10A and PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells treated with 20 m M ML - 7 showed only a minimal reduction of pMLC ( Supplementary Figure S4 ) consistent with others who have reported that ML - 7 does not decrease pMLC . 31 – 33 MLCK has also been shown to have a role in disrupting the cortex 34 and have a kinase - independent activity that stimulates the dissociation of actin and myosin . 35 If cortical disruption and dissociation of actin and myosin is inhibited by ML - 7 , the actin cortex would essentially be ‘locked , ’ a prediction consistent with our observations that ML - 7 induces a rounded , smooth shape that suppresses McTNs . Despite their inhibitory effects on myosin , blebbistatin treatment results in a ‘loosening , ’ whereas ML - 7 treatment results in a ‘tightening’ of actin cortex . 30 Our previous studies have shown that the McTNs promote the reattachment of cells to tissue culture substrates and endothelial PTEN loss induces microtentacle formation MI Vitolo et al 2201 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2013 ) 2200 – 2210 monolayers . 7 , 23 , 27 However , when McTNs were induced by actin depolymerization , cell attachment was not signiﬁcantly increased . 7 Although actin depolymerization can decrease cell - ular contractility to increase McTNs , it may also impair cytoskeletal functions necessary for ﬁrm adhesion . Blebbistatin induced McTNs , but to verify that these induced McTNs maintained functionality , we assessed cell - substratum reattachment . Change in impedance was measured for PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) and parental cells during initial adhesion ( the ﬁrst hour after initial cell seeding ) . In the presence of blebbistatin , cells adhered two - fold quicker than that of the control ( Figure 3d ; raw data , Supplementary Figure S5 ) . Conversely , cells plated in ML - 7 - containing media attached two - fold slower and never regained the ability to spread ( Figure 3d ; raw data , Supplementary Figure S5 ) . Although broadly depoly - merizing actin generates McTNs that cannot increase attachment , speciﬁcally altering actomyosin contractility can either suppress McTNs ( ML - 7 ) or induce McTNs that remain functional for cell - substratum attachment ( blebbistatin ) . Activated coﬁlin is elevated in the suspended PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) MECs and regulates McTNs We were able to manipulate cellular contractility , the actin cytoskeleton and McTN production by modulating the function of non - muscle myosin II . Therefore , we examined the phosphor - ylation status of MLC , but no consistent differences between suspended MCF - 10A and PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) clones were observed ( Supplementary Figure S6 ) . Alternatively , we found that the MCF - 10A parental cells maintained a higher level of phosphory - lated ( inactive ) coﬁlin ( Figure 4a ) . Densitometry analysis of four separate experiments shows that pCoﬁlin levels only decrease by 20 % in MCF - 10A cells after detachment . By comparison , pCoﬁlin levels are reduced by 55 – 75 % in PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells , indicating a more robust detachment - induced activation of coﬁlin in PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells ( Figure 4b ) . We constructed a non - phosphorylatable mutant coﬁlin ( S3A ) that remains active 36 upstream of the IRES - GFP marker and scored GFP - positive transfected cells for McTNs pro - duction . There is a signiﬁcant difference in coﬁlin phosphorylation Figure 1 . Tubulin - based McTNs are increased on PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) MECs . ( a ) MCF - 10A cells and three PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) clones were ﬂuorescently stained with CellMask Orange and suspended in an ultra - low attachment plate in complete media . Blinded counting showed a consistent McTN increase in the PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells ( n ¼ 6 , * P o 0 . 002 ) .

PTEN loss induces microtentacle formation MI Vitolo et al 2202 Oncogene ( 2013 ) 2200 – 2210 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited and McTN generation between vector control and wild - type ( WT ) coﬁlin - expressing cells and between the WT coﬁlin - and S3A - expressing cells ( Figure 4c ) . MCF - 10A cells were able to highly phosphorylate exogenous WT coﬁlin and suppress McTNs . Although the S3A mutant did not induce McTNs to the levels observed in PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells , likely due to the fact that it was unable to suppress phosphorylation of endogenous coﬁlin as the levels of pCoﬁlin remain similar to that of the non - transfected and vector - transfected controls ( Figure 4c ) , it was able to relieve suppression of McTNs observed in the WT overexpressing cells . The PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells were similarly able to highly phosphorylate exogenous WT coﬁlin , which resulted in suppression of McTNs ( Figure 4d ) . To further conﬁrm that an increase in inactivated coﬁlin could decrease McTNs production , a coﬁlin S3E phospho - mimic was also constructed for expression in the PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells 36 and able to suppress McTNs ( Figure 4d ) . Beyond exogenous expression of WT and mutant coﬁlin , we were able to manipulate endogenous coﬁlin phosphorylation levels via expression of the coﬁlin phosphatase , Slingshot - 1L ( SSH ) . SSH expression depho - sphorylates coﬁlin ( activates ) , leading to an increase in McTN production ( Figure 4e ) . Both the vector control and the catalytically inactive SSH are unable to dephosphorylate coﬁlin or produce any increase in McTNs ( Figure 4e ) . Increased activated coﬁlin in the PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) MECs is not due to elevated PI3K or AKT activity The absence of PTEN expression promotes the activation of the PI3K and MAPK pathways , 14 and PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells maintain higher levels of pAKT than parental controls in suspension ( Figure 4a ) . To determine the importance of the PI3K pathway in the production of McTNs , a small - molecule inhibitor ( LY294002 ) was used to suppress PI3K activity , which was conﬁrmed by a dose - dependent decrease in pAKT in all the three PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) clones ( Figure 5a ) . Figure 2 . Attachment and homotypic aggregation are enhanced in PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells .

PTEN loss induces microtentacle formation MI Vitolo et al 2203 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2013 ) 2200 – 2210 If the increase in PI3K activity or pAKT in the PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells was responsible for the decrease in pCoﬁlin , the pCoﬁlin levels should increase upon LY294002 treatment . However , this was not the case . Despite the presence of the PI3K inhibitor , the pCoﬁlin levels remained much lower in all the three PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) clones than the MCF - 10A controls ( Figure 5a ) and addition of LY294002 did not alter McTN production ( Figure 5b ) . Therefore , PI3K activity and / or pAKT are not responsible for the coﬁlin activation and increased McTNs in the suspended PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells . In support of this conclusion , the MCF - 10A cells with the ‘knock - in’ PIK3CA mutations in exon 9 or 20 , which render PI3K constitutively active , 37 do not exhibit increased McTNs over the MCF - 10A cells ( Figure 5c ) . Additionally , although the clones with the activating PI3K maintain elevated pAKT levels in suspension , their pCoﬁlin levels do not decrease past that of the suspended MCF - 10A cells ( Figure 5d and e ) . Future investigations will be required to determine if PTEN’s role as a broad - spectrum protein phosphatase or cytoskeletal docking protein are responsible for this coﬁlin regulation , but our results establish that PTEN loss activates coﬁlin without requiring PI3K or Akt activity . PI3K mutation and PTEN loss differentially regulate LIM - kinase1 ( LIMK ) and SSH LIMK and SSH - 1L are known to speciﬁcally regulate coﬁlin phosphorylation . LIMK can be activated through phosphorylation of T508 by downstream kinases in the Rho family , 38 – 40 but SSH - 1L can be inactivated by phosphorylation ( S978 ) . 41 , 42 Western blot analysis of PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells reveals an absence of phosphorylated LIMK1 ( pLIMK ) - T508 and phosphorylated SSH - 1L ( pSSH - 1L ) - S978 ( Figure 6a ) , and there is no difference in pLIMK - T508 and pSSH - 1L - S978 levels in attached and detached PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells . Therefore , the phosphorylation states of LIMK and SSH - 1L at these sites are likely not responsible for the robust decrease in coﬁlin Figure 3 . Decreased contractility enhances McTNs .

( d ) Real - time attachment measurements of blebbistatin - treated MCF - 10A and PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells attach approximately two - fold quicker at 1h compared with the dimethyl sulfoxide control cells . At all time points , ML - 7 - treated cells attached approximately 50 % less than that of the controls . Impedance values are normalized to dimethyl sulfoxide controls ( n ¼ 4 , representative results from triplicate experiments ) . PTEN loss induces microtentacle formation MI Vitolo et al 2204 Oncogene ( 2013 ) 2200 – 2210 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited phosphorylation in the suspended PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells . This ﬁnding lends additional support to our conclusion that the change in pCoﬁlin in the PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells is a PI3K - independent event as SSH - 1L has been shown to modulate coﬁlin through PI3K . 43 In contrast , cells expressing mutant PI3K do maintain higher levels of pLIMK - T508 and pSSH - 1L - S978 ( Figure 6b ) . Therefore , the presence of phosphorylated pLIMK - T508 and pSSH - 1L - S978 in the mutant PI3K - expressing cells and the absence of pLIMK - T508 and pSSH - 1L - S978 in the PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells provides a mechanistic difference that could account for the different levels of pCoﬁlin observed between these two genotypes . Deﬁning the complete signaling mechanisms by which PTEN loss and PI3K mutation cause this differential regulation of pLIMK - T508 and pSSH - 1L - S978 will be an important focus for future studies . Coﬁlin activation is directly due to PTEN loss To determine whether the increase in activated coﬁlin is a direct effect of PTEN loss , we restored PTEN expression in the PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells . When both the PTEN or GFP proteins were expressed in adherent PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells , there was no difference in the pCoﬁlin levels ( Figure 7a ) . However , an increase in pCoﬁlin was observed in Figure 4 . Coﬁlin is activated in suspended cells , but to a much higher degree in cells without PTEN expression . ( a ) Representative western blot analysis shows that coﬁlin is highly phosphorylated ( pCoﬁlin ) and inactive when cells are attached and dephosphorylated to an active form when cells are detached . ( b ) Densitometry analysis shows that pCoﬁlin levels only decrease 20 % in MCF - 10A cells after detachment . By comparison , pCoﬁlin levels are reduced 55 – 75 % in PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells , indicating a more robust detachment - induced activation of coﬁlin in PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells . Levels of pCoﬁlin were normalized to total coﬁlin in each sample and the ratio of pCoﬁlin in suspended cells compared with attached cells was determined ( n ¼ 4 , * P o 0 . 01 ) . ( c ) MCF - 10A cells transfected with vector only ( V ) , coﬁlin ( WT ) or mutant coﬁlin ( S3A ) and ( d ) PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells transfected with vector only ( V ) , coﬁlin ( WT ) or mutant coﬁlin ( S3E ) for 24h . Untransfected ( NT ) and transfected cells were blindly counted for McTNs ( n ¼ 6 , * P o 0 . 01 ) and analyzed by western blotting . ( e ) MCF - 10A cells were transfected with vector only ( V ) , WT SSH ( SSH WT ) or catalytically inactive SSH ( SSH CS ) for 24h and scored blindly for McTNs ( n ¼ 6 , * P o 0 . 01 ) or analyzed by western blotting . PTEN loss induces microtentacle formation MI Vitolo et al 2205 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2013 ) 2200 – 2210 the suspended PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells when PTEN was reexpressed as compared with GFP - expressing control cells ( Figure 7a ) . Multiple cell samples were ﬁxed in suspension and subjected to blinded McTN scoring ( Figure 7b ) . The results of quantitative McTN analysis indicate that reexpression of PTEN in PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells suppresses McTNs . Therefore , PTEN has a direct effect on McTNs formation and coﬁlin phosphorylation . DISCUSSION According to the cellular tensegrity model , epithelial cells counteract the outward force of microtubules , originating from the microtubule organizing center , through contraction of the cortical actin cytoskeleton . 44 Imbalances in cortical regulation can weaken the actin cortex to allow McTN formation . Coﬁlin is a ubiquitously expressed actin - binding protein required for the reorganization of actin ﬁlaments , and its phopho - regulation has been directly linked to cortical actin integrity where depleted or inactivated coﬁlin results in elevated actomyosin contractility . 45 Our study demonstrates that suspended MECs devoid of PTEN exhibit an increase in activated coﬁlin compared with their isogenic PTEN - expressing controls ( Figure 4 ) , leading to increased McTN formation , and that the phosphorylation state of coﬁlin serine - 3 is sufﬁcient to regulate McTNs ( Figures 4c - e ) . The low levels of pCoﬁlin in suspended PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells are not due to activation of the PI3K pathway . Although pAKT diminishes in the PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells with increasing doses of the PI3K inhibitor , LY294002 , the pCoﬁlin levels remain low and the McTNs counts do Figure 5 . Increased coﬁlin activity in the PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) MECs is not due to elevated PI3K or AKT activity .

( d ) Representative western blot analysis of attached and suspended MCF - 10A cells compared with those bearing the E545K and H1074R PIK3CA mutations . ( e ) Densitometry results show the ratio of suspended normalized pCoﬁlin levels to attached normalized coﬁlin levels is similar in the MCF - 10A and PIK3CA mutant cells ( n ¼ 3 ) . PTEN loss induces microtentacle formation MI Vitolo et al 2206 Oncogene ( 2013 ) 2200 – 2210 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited not change . Additionally , the PIK3CA cells containing activated PI3K mutations do not exhibit an increased McTN or decreased pCoﬁlin , supporting the conclusion that it is not the PI3K pathway activation that causes increased McTN production and coﬁlin activation in the PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells . Although in another cell system , growth - factor - induced dephosphorylation of pCoﬁlin was due to PI3K - mediated SSH - 1L activation , 43 the dephosphorylation of pCoﬁlin we observe with homozygous deletion of PTEN in detached MECs does not seem to operate via a similar mechanism because both PI3K inhibition with LY294002 and PI3K - activating mutants did not affect coﬁlin activation . The differences in cell type , ECM attachment state and growth - factor stimulation could explain these apparent differences in signaling mechanism . The coﬁlin - regulating molecules LIMK1 and SSH also differ between suspended PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) and PIK3CA cells . The PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells maintain lower levels of pLIMK - T508 and pSSH - S978 , which would both favor reduced pCoﬁlin . In contrast to PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells , the PIK3CA cells exhibit higher levels of pLIMK and pSSH than the PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells , events which would both favor increased pCoﬁlin . Further studies are needed to assess whether LIMK is activated via another mechanism or whether other known coﬁlin - speciﬁc phosphatases ( SSH2 , SSH3 and chronophin ) are more active in the PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells . 46 , 47 Nonetheless , differential activation of LIMK , SSH , coﬁlin and McTNs between the PI3K mutant and PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells deﬁnes a series of important mechanistic differences in cytoskeletal signaling between PTEN loss and PI3K activation . In addition to regulating the PI3K pathway and phosphoinosi - tide production , PTEN may have other catalytic , binding or dephosphorylating properties affecting coﬁlin activation . As a protein phosphatase , PTEN can dephosphorylate tyrosine - , serine - and threonine - phosphorylated peptides , 48 although it is not clear how or if PTEN and coﬁlin associate . PTEN contains a conserved catalytic domain shared with other protein - tyrosine - phosphatases , ﬂanked by noncatalytic , regulatory sequences ( protein - tyrosine - phosphatases reviewed in Denu et al . 49 ) . In addition to its catalytic domain , PTEN has a potential binding site for PDZ domain - containing proteins at its C - terminus . 50 PTEN also contains a stretch of sequence , overlaping the catalytic domain , which is similar to a domain within the cytoskeletal proteins tensin and auxilin , suggesting that PTEN may participate in regulating cytoskeletal phosphorylation events . 51 PTEN loss / mutation and the reciprocal oncogenic PIK3CA are common targets of mutation in human cancers , being the second most commonly mutated target next to p53 . Although some have shown these mutations to be mutually exclusive , 52 others argue that PTEN loss and PIK3CA are concordant . It is believed that PTEN protein loss and PIK3CA mutations have different functional effects on activation of the PI3K signaling pathway , which could lead to different outcomes . 53 , 54 A recent study of 125 patients under the age of 55 with lymph - node - negative invasive BCs treated with adjuvant chemotherapy identiﬁed PTEN positivity correlated with an excellent prognosis , whereas the PI3K / AKT / Figure 6 . LIMK and SSH are differentially regulated by PTEN loss and PIK3CA activation in detached MECs .

( b ) Western blot analysis of suspended MCF - 10A cells and mutant PI3K clones . Figure 7 . Expression of PTEN decreases activated coﬁlin and McTNs in PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells . MCF - 10A PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) clones ( 1 , 2 and 3 ) were infected with either PTEN or GFP ( CT ) adenovirus once a day for 2 days . ( a ) Both attached and suspended ( 1h ) cells were analyzed by western blot for pCoﬁlin ( n ¼ 3 , representative blot ) and ( b ) McTN formation ( n ¼ 6 , * P o 0 . 002 ) . PTEN loss induces microtentacle formation MI Vitolo et al 2207 & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2013 ) 2200 – 2210 mTOR pathway had no prognostic value . 55 Another study determined that PTEN loss is strongly associated with both mouse and human basal - like BC , which is among the BC subtypes with the worst prognosis . 56 A third study analyzing gene proﬁles from 351 stage II BC tumors determined that 86 % of tumor samples had PTEN mRNA levels below the median and a signature PTEN loss expression proﬁle , which included 11 ( 3 % ) samples with PIK3CA mutation along with the low PTEN mRNA levels . 52 The same group used another set of 295 BC samples for gene proﬁling and the cases with signature PTEN loss expression proﬁle had signiﬁcantly worse disease - free survival by Kaplan – Meier survival curves . Recent clinical studies highlight differences in patient outcomes depending on whether a PTEN loss / mutation or PIK3CA mutation is harbored , and PTEN loss leads to a worse prognosis . 52 , 55 , 56 In this study , we have observed that dynamic , tubulin - based McTNs increase in MCF - 10A PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) clones compared with their isogenic , parental MCF - 10A or the PIK3CA - mutated MCF - 10A cells . These results establish novel and important distinctions in the cytoskeletal pathway activation that occur with PTEN loss as compared with PIK3CA activation . Signiﬁcant differences in the activation state of coﬁlin , LIMK and SSH were all noted between cells with PTEN loss and those with activation of PI3KCA , which could each contribute to the differential elevation of McTNs in PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells . Data indicate that McTNs regulate adhesive properties of detached cells and can increase the efﬁciency of CTCs reattachment to metastatic sites . 26 , 27 This is consistent with the in vivo ﬁnding that CTC adhesion is tubulin - dependent and enhanced by actin depolymerization . 57 Our studies demonstrate that PTEN deletion increases both tumor - cell survival 14 and McTN formation in detached cells . These cellular effects provide two possible explanations for why PTEN loss is thought to speciﬁcally increase the risk of hematogenous metastasis in BC . 52 Elucidating the critical mechanisms by which PTEN loss enhances these metastatic risk factors may aid the design of novel therapeutic strategies that reduce metastasis by selectively targeting the survival and reattachment of CTCs . Given the numerous differences in cytoskeletal structure and signaling noted between cells with PTEN loss and PIK3CA activation , our data reveal that the prognostic implications and treatment strategies for these two genotypes may ultimately be very distinct . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture MCF - 10A cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA , USA ) . The maintenance of the MCF - 10A , MCF - 10A / PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) and MCF - 10A / PIK3CA ‘knock - in’ cell lines has been previously described . 14 , 37 Cells were maintained in a 37 1 C incubator with 5 % CO 2 . Membrane McTN scoring Cells were trypsinized and suspended in complete media without phenol red for 30min . Cells were either counted live as previously described 23 or ﬁxed . Brieﬂy , a 50 1 C - prewarmed solution of phosphate - buffered saline paraformaldehyde was added to the suspended cells for a ﬁnal concentration of 4 % . Cells were incubated for 10min at room temperature . An equal volume of Fluoromount plus CellMask Orange plasma membrane stain ( 1 : 10000 , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) and Hoechst 33342 ( 1 : 5000 , Sigma - Aldrich , St Louis , MO , USA ) were added . A portion of the ﬁxed and stained cell solution was transferred to a slide and protected with a coverslip . Single cells were scored blindly for McTNs . Cells with two or more McTNs extending greater than the radius of the cell body were scored as positive . Plasmids and transfections Coﬁlin , S3A and S3E were PCR ampliﬁed using the following primers and ligated into the Xho I / Eco RI sites of the pIRES2 - AcGFP1 plasmid ( Clontech , Mountain View , CA , USA ) . Sense primers : ( WT ) 5 0 - CTCGAGATGGCCTCCG GTGTGGCTGTCTCT - 3 0 , ( S3A ) 5 0 - CTCGAGATGGCCGCCGGTGTGGCTGTCTCT - 3 0 , ( S3E ) 5 0 - CTCGAGATGGCCGAGGGTGTGGCTGTCTCT - 3 0 ; antisense primer : 5 0 - GAATTCTCACAAAGGCTTGCCCTCCAGG - 3 0 . The SSH and SSH ( CS ) plasmids were very generous gifts from Dr Alyson Fournier . 58 pAcGFP1 - Mem ( GFP - mem ) was purchased from Clontech . Transfections were performed using Fugene - HD ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . Immunoﬂuorescence Cells were ﬁxed in suspension with 0 . 3 % glutaraldehyde in 80m M pipes , pH 6 . 8 , 1m M MgCl 2 , 5m M EGTA and 0 . 5 % NP40 for 20min at room temperature then centrifuged ( 300r . p . m . , 5min ) on to poly - L - lysine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) - coated coverslips . After washing with phosphate - buffered saline , cells were incubated with 10mg / ml NaBH 4 for 7min , washed with phosphate - buffered saline and then incubated with 10mg / ml bovine serum albumin and 0 . 1 % Tween 20 in phosphate - buffered saline prior to antibody staining . Microtubules were stained indirectly using an anti - a - tubulin ( DM1A , 1 : 1000 ; eBioscience , San Diego , CA , USA ) followed by AlexaFluor568 - or AlexaFluor488 - conjugated secondary antibody ( 1 : 1000 ; Invitrogen ) . Hoechst 33342 ( 1 : 5000 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) was added during secondary antibody incubation . Z - stacks were obtained using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope ( Olympus , Center Valley , PA , USA ) . Stacks were imaged as maximum intensity projections using ImageJ ( NIH , Bethesda , MD , USA ) . Cell association assay The same PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) clone was plated in duplicate , one stained with CellMask Orange and the other transfected with GFP - mem . Cells were trypsinized , mixed in a single well and allowed to associate . Live cell images were captured using an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope . Three - dimensional surface rendering was done using the Volocity software ( ImproVision Inc . , Waltham , MA , USA ) . Attachment assay The impedance assay used an xCelligence RTCA SP real - time cell - sensing device ( Roche Applied Science , Indianapolis , IN , USA ) to assess attach - ment . 27 Impedance values were normalized to the parental MCF - 10A control line for each time point . Test cell lines were represented as the fold change of the control cell line attachment . Western blot analysis Western blots were performed as previously described . 14 Primary antibodies for PTEN , pAKT ( S473 ) , AKT , phosphorylated extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 / 2 ( pERK1 / 2 ) , ERK1 / 2 , pCoﬁlin ( Ser3 ) and coﬁlin were purchased from Cell Signaling ( Danvers , MA , USA ) ; a second coﬁlin antibody recognizing the C - terminal end , LIMK and pLIMK was purchased from Abcam ( Cambridge , MA , USA ) ; SSH and pSSH were purchased from ECM Biosciences ( Versailles , KY , USA ) ; and anti - GFP was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) . All the antibodies were used at the manufacturer’s recommended dilutions . Densitometry was performed using ImageJ . Adenoviral infection Equal numbers of PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells were infected daily for 2 days with either a PTEN or GFP control adenovirus ( Vector Biolabs , Philadelphia , PA , USA ) . Cell lysates were harvested while the cells were attached or after 1 - h suspension . Lysates were analyzed by western blotting . Duplicate PTEN - or GFP - infected cells , both attached and suspended , were ﬁxed , stained and blindly scored for McTN production . Statistical analysis Signiﬁcance was measured by t - test ( Excel , Microsoft , Redmond , WA , USA ) . CONFLICT OF INTEREST The PTEN (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells are licensed by Horizon Discovery Ltd .
