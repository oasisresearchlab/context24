Introduction In spite of the remarkable progress achieved in the fight against malaria , the disease continues to have debilitating impact on people’s health and livelihoods . Global update from 2015 showed that 212 million cases of malaria led to 429 000 deaths of which most of the victims were children aged under 5 years in Africa [ 1 ] . Specifically , in the same year , 92 % of death cases due to malaria occurred in the African Region , 6 % in the South - East Asia Region , and 2 % in the Eastern Mediterranean Region . Children under 5 are especially susceptible to malaria illness , infection and death . Reports from 2015 also showed that malaria killed an estimated 303 000 under - fives across the world , with 292 000 occurring in the African Region . The disease kills 1 child every 2 minutes [ 1 ] . The malaria parasite , acquires iron during various stages of its life cycle . There have been theories that the blood stage of the parasite acquires iron from serum transferrin , from iron produced during the breakdown of hemoglobin , or from a free pool of intracellular iron [ 2 ] . Malaria induces the destruction of infected and non - infected red blood cells . This hinders the ability of reticuloendothelial macrophages to recycle iron back to the bone marrow [ 3 ] . Iron deficiency anaemia ( IDA ) is the most prevalent anaemia globally , and it is more common in developing countries [ 4 , 5 ] ; were malaria morbidity and mortality is predominant [ 3 ] . The primary iron storage protein that acts as a reservoir for iron is ferritin [ 6 ] . It plays a key role in the regulation of iron homeostasis and is also accepted as a biomarker in the evaluation of body iron stores [ 7 ] . Made up of an approximately spherical apoprotein shell ( molecular weight of 480 000 ) that encloses a core of ferric hydroxyphosphate of about 4 000 iron atoms ) , human ferritin is composed of two immunologically distinct types : H and L [ 6 ] . The H - subunit functions as a ferroxidase and carries out oxidation of iron to the Fe 2 + form , while the L - subunit is associated with iron nucleation , mineralization , and long term iron storage [ 8 ] . When iron is exported to serum , it is bound by the glycosylated iron - transport protein known as transferrin ( Tf ) . Found in the blood plasma , lymph , and other body fluids , Tf is saddled with the responsibility of transporting iron to all cells . This keeps free iron at very low concentrations inimical to the survival of iron - dependent pathogens [ 9 ] like Plasmodium species . The enabling step in the uptake of iron from Tf requires that the protein is attached to specific receptors on the surface of the cell known as transferrin receptor ( TfR1 ) . Another receptor , TfR2 also binds Tf and may act as the homeostatic iron sensor , regulating hepcidin synthesis in response to diferricTf concentration [ 6 ] . Hepcidin is a peptide hormone with 25 amino acids [ 10 ] . Chromosome 19 carries the hepcidin antimicrobial peptide ( HAMP ) gene that encodes hepcidin , through the 84 amino acid precursor known as Serum Hepcidin Concentration is Elevated during Malaria Infection among Children DOI : 10 . 9790 / 3008 - 1301043741 www . iosrjournals . org 38 | Page preprohepcidin [ 6 , 10 ] . This precursor molecule , thereafter , undergoes two enzymatic cleavages in the hepatocyte cytoplasm and in the blood , to liberate the 25 amino acid - containing biologically active form known as hepcidin - 25 [ 10 ] . The role of hepcidin is the inhibition and subsequent destruction of ferroportein ( FPN1 ) . FPN1 is the major iron export protein , located in the basolateral surface of gut enterocytes and the plasma membrane of reticuloendothelial ( RE ) cells like macrophages [ 11 , 12 ] . Malaria and iron deficiency ( ID ) are major public health problems for children living in sub - Saharan Africa . Many researchers have done work on malaria among children in these regions [ 13 – 17 ] . Serum hepcidin may be a good marker for the prediction of anaemia of inflammation ( AI ) [ 18 ] . This research work was aimed at evaluating serum hepcidin concentration dynamics during malaria infection among children in Sokoto , North - Western Nigeria . II . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 Subjects and Setting The subjects in this cross - sectional study comprised 402 children diagnosed with malaria , as well as malaria negative control subjects ; all aged between 1 and 17 years . Informed consent was obtained from the guardian or parents of the subjects . The study was conducted in the paediatric department of Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital ( UDUTH ) Sokoto and Specialist Hospital Sokoto which are Tertiary Hospital in Sokoto metropolis . Sokoto is located in North - West Geographical zone of Nigeria . 2 . 2 Laboratory 2 . 2 . 1 Blood Sample Collection Blood sample was collected by venipuncture as described by Jurry et al [ 19 ] . 4mls of venous blood was obtained from each of the subjects , 2mls was dispensed into plain bottle . Sera were obtained after centrifuging the blood samples at 4500 × g for 15 minutes and were stored at - 20 o C until analysis . The remaining two 2mls of blood was transferred in to EDTA bottle under aseptic condition . The samples collected in EDTA bottles were carefully mixed 5 - 6 times to prevent clotting . About 6µl and 2µl of EDTA blood samples were collected and placed on a clean - grease free glass slide ; 6µl for thick film and the 2µl for thin film . The blood films were made immediately ( within 30 minutes ) after sample collection and thick films were handled with care avoiding it being washed away during staining [ 20 , 21 ] . 2 . 2 . 2 Laboratory Analysis 2 . 2 . 2 . 1 Malaria Parasite Testing The SD Bioline Malaria Ag P . f / Pan Rapid Test Kit was used to carry out the malaria parasite test ( 05CDA096A ) [ 22 , 23 ] . This was then followed by microscopy using stained thick and thin blood film for effective determination of parasite density [ 20 ] . 2 . 2 . 2 . 2 Serum Hepcidin Estimation Serum hepcidin level was estimated using the enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) kit from Kamiya biomedical company , USA ( KT - 50560 ) [ 24 ] . 2 . 2 . 2 . 3 Serum Iron Estimation Serum iron was estimated using colorimetric assay kit procured from BiovisionInc . [ 25 ] . 2 . 2 . 2 . 4 Serum Ferritin Estimation Serum ferritin level was estimated using ELISA kit procured from Enzo - Life - Science , UK ( ELS - 20015 ) . 2 . 2 . 2 . 5 Total Iron Binding Capacity ( TIBC ) Estimation TIBC was estimated using colorimetric assay kit procured from Biovision Inc . , USA ( BID - 10543 ) . 2 . 3 Statistical Analysis The data obtained were analyzed using SPSS Version 20 . They were grouped into malaria positive and negative subjects , as well as various age groups , expressed empirically . The Kolmogorov - Smirnov test was used to determine the normality of the data . Analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was used for comparison of 3 or more groups while the independent t - test was used for comparisons between 2 groups . Correlation test was also carried out using Pearson’s linear correlation analysis . P value ≤ 0 . 05 was considered as statistically significant . III . Results A total of 402 children were enrolled for this study comprising 200 ( 49 . 8 % ) males and 202 ( 51 . 2 % ) females of age range 1 - 17 years . The results from Table 1 showed that 126 ( 31 . 3 % ) children were malaria infected while 276 ( 68 . 7 % ) were non malaria infected children . Table 2 compares the serum hepcidin concentration and some iron indices between the malaria infected and malaria negative subjects ( control ) showing statistically significant differences for all parameters . Results from Table 3 shows significant correlation between serum hepcidin concentration and malaria parasite density . Further details are found in the tables below .

IV . Discussion Malaria , ID , anaemia , and high infection rate are intertwined factors common among young African children [ 26 ] . The epidemiological data of malaria varies with geographical location . Thus , specific data obtained for a given location can be of help when designing strategic malaria control programs [ 16 ] . In Nigeria , the disease is endemic and shows seasonality in the various geographic zones of the country [ 27 ] . In 2009 , the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Health showed that malaria contributed directly to 25 % of infant mortality and 30 % of under - five mortality [ 28 ] . Out of a total of 402 subjects , aged between 1 – 17 years , who were enrolled for this study , results showed that 126 ( 31 . 3 % ) children were infected with malaria ( Table 1 ) . This result is higher than that of Abdullahi et al . [ 16 ] who reported 27 . 29 % prevalence rate and lower compared to the results of the study of Umaru and Uyaiabasi [ 29 ] who reported 35 . 7 % prevalence rate . This result is also lower when compared to the result of the study of Jiya et al . [ 30 ] in Sokoto , who reported the prevalence rate of 45 . 4 % among children . The prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum infection in this study was also lower than the 60 . 6 % obtained by Dawaki et al . [ 31 ] among Hausa communities in Kano state , Nigeria . This relatively low prevalence could be due to absence of breeding sites for the Anopheles vector in some months of the year . The proliferation of Plasmodium during malaria infection requires iron during the clinically silent liver stage of growth and in the pathological phase of erythrocyte invasion [ 2 ] ; and the small molecule hepcidin , has been identified as a vital controller of iron bioavailability [ 32 , 33 ] . In this study , there was a statistically significant increase ( p = . 00 ) in the serum hepcidin concentration in malaria infected children ( 273 . 88 ± 59 . 84 ng / ml ) in comparison to non - malaria infected children ( 163 . 23 ± 70 . 81 ng / ml ) ( Table 2 ) . This result indicate Serum Hepcidin Concentration is Elevated during Malaria Infection among Children DOI : 10 . 9790 / 3008 - 1301043741 www . iosrjournals . org 40 | Page upregulation of hepcidin response during malaria infection and agrees with that of several studies [ 26 , 33 – 35 ] . Moreover , malaria parasite density showed a strong positive correlation ( r = . 03 , p = . 05 ) with serum hepcidin concentration ( Table 3 ) . Humans and mice infected with Plasmodium have been shown to have elevated plasma hepcidin levels with positive correlation to parasitemia and plasma IL - 6 [ 36 ] . The upregulation of hepcidin during malaria infection may contribute to anaemia [ 2 , 32 ] , through its binding to FPN1 and subsequent internalization in lysosomes [ 6 ] . This may have protective effect as shown in mice during experimental malaria . Immunoneutralization of hepcidin was associated with parasitemia and death in Plasmodium berghei infection . This was not the case when the animals were pretreated with a hepcidin - expressing lentivirus that conferred some form of protection to the infection [ 36 ] . Results from this study , on the contrary , showed a significant decrease ( p = . 00 ) in the serum iron concentration between malaria infected children ( 57 . 52 ± 17 . 07 µg ) and non - malaria infected control ( 106 . 96 ± 35 . 95 µg ) . This was similar to the serum ferritin concentration for the 2 groups ( Table 2 ) . These results were similar to those obtained by Jeremiah et al . [ 37 ] , and Onuoha [ 38 ] who showed in their study that serum iron , serum ferritin , and total iron binding capacity were affected by malaria at p < . 01 . This may be the consequence of intravascular hemolysis of parasitized red cells , phagocytosis of parasitized and unparasitized red cells , and hypersplenism associated with the anaemia seen in acute malaria [ 3 ] . V . Conclusion Our study had shown that serum hepcidin concentration is increased during malaria infection among children in our study population . We further infer that determination of serum hepcidin concentration in synergy with other iron parameters may be a useful marker in the prognosis and management of malaria infection in our setting . the determination of serum hepcidin concentration in synergy with other iron parameters may be a useful marker in the prognosis and management of malaria infection in Sokoto , Nigeria .
