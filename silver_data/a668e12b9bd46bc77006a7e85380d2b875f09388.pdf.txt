China Abstract It becomes challenging to identify feasible control strategies for simultaneously relaxing the countermeasures and containing the Covid - 19 pandemic , given China’s huge population size , high susceptibility , persist vacci - nation wanning , and relatively weak strength of health systems . We propose a novel mathematical model with waning of immunity and solve the optimal control problem , in order to provide an insight on how much detect - ing and social distancing are required to coordinate socio - economic activities and epidemic control . We obtain the optimal intensity of countermeasures , i . e . , the dynamic nucleic acid screening and social distancing , under which the health system is functioning normally and people can engage in a certain level of socio - economic activities . We ﬁnd that it is the isolation capacity or the restriction of the case fatality rate ( CFR ) rather than the hospital capacity that mainly determines the optimal strategies . And the solved optimal controls under quar - terly CFR restrictions exhibit oscillations . It is worth noticing that , if without considering booster or very low booster rate , the optimal strategy is a ”on - o ﬀ ” mode , alternating between lock down and opening with certain social distancing , which reﬂects the importance and necessity of China’s static management on a certain area during Covid - 19 outbreak . The ﬁndings suggest some feasible paths to smoothly transit from the Covid - 19 pandemic to an endemic phase .

Introduction Since the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , many countries have experienced the multiple outbreaks of infection , accompanied by lockdown , opening and re - lockdown and re - opening and etc [ 1 , 2 ] . A series of strong prevention and control measures have been taken to e ﬀ ectively keep transmission suppressed for two more years in China [ 3 , 4 ] . However , enforcing these countermeasures for long periods of time can have substantial negative socio - economic impacts . Recently , many developed western countries have almost completely canceled o ﬀ travel restrictions and other interventions given high coverage of vaccination and natural transmissions [ 5 ] . Faced with the pressure of imported cases and spreading domestic outbreaks , China’s ticking to the dynamic zero - COVID policy becomes great challenging . It is urgent to propose ∗ Corresponding author .

Mathematical modeling has played a key role in examining the e ﬀ ectiveness of intervention measures and informing the key parameters that a ﬀ ect the disease infection . In response to the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic , some researchers considered the various scenarios with di ﬀ erent intensities of nonpharmaceutical measures under which a stable equilibrium with low case numbers was attained [ 6 ] . Lauro et al . examined the optimal timing of one - short interventions for epidemic control by observing total attack rate , peak prevalence and average time of infection [ 7 ] . Some researchers have investigated optimal control strategies based on Pontryagin’s maximum principle [ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ] . Bin et al . proposed an on - o ﬀ ( also called bang - bang ) social distancing policy for mitigating a second wave [ 14 ] . Kumar Das et al . framed an optimal control problem to analyze the e ﬀ ectiveness of diagnosis based on traced contacts made by a conﬁrmed COVID patient [ 15 ] . Lu et al . proposed a novel two - stage epidemic model with a dynamic control strategy to seek appropriate control strategies to minimize the control cost and ensure the normal operation of society [ 16 ] . The optimal control questions usually involve the minimization of the number of infected individuals as well as the economic cost of the countermeasures by looking for the optimal intensify of nonpharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) [ 8 , 9 , 14 ] . The optimal vaccination scheme has also been considered by many researchers in order to answer who should be vaccinated ﬁrst . Matrajt et al . presented optimal age - targeted vaccination policies , and obtained that when minimizing deaths , it is optimal to vaccinate the elderly ( younger age groups ) for low ( high ) vaccine e ﬃ cacy [ 17 ] . Grundel et al . coordinated both social distance and vaccination to mitigate SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks by formulating an age - di ﬀ erentiated compartmental model in an attempt to answer how much social distancing measures can be relaxed for various coverage of vaccination [ 18 ] . However , as immunity is waning and the lack of clinically e ﬀ ective drugs , simultaneous optimal control of cost and social distancing as well as avoiding run of medical resources becomes challenging and falls within the scope of this study . Our main purpose is not to eliminate the infection , but rather to demonstrate how to coordinate disease control and social distancing , and to provide some guiding principles of not only beneﬁting public health and psychological well - being but also proﬁting the economy , which will apply to our national policy on mitigating COVID - 19 pandemic . To this end , we propose a novel mathematical model with waning of immunity and examine the optimal contact rate and detection rate such that cost is minimized , and as well as the number of hospitalized / isolated individuals no greater than the hospital / isolation capacity . In order to transit from COVID - 19 pandemic to endemic phase , we further include the case fatality rate ( CFR ) as a restriction . Whereafter , the e ﬀ ect of vaccine on controlling the spread of COVID - 19 is also analyzed . Our results have essential implications for ongoing discussion of ”dynamics zero” policy and provide insights into preparedness for future pandemics . 2 . A compartmental model and optimal control problems In this section , we establish a dynamic model tailored to COVID - 19 by incorporating social distancing , nucleic acid screening and vaccination . Considering fairly high vaccination rate and the fact that immunity improves after vaccination and / or natural infection but wanes as antibodies decay [ 19 ] , we divided the popula - 2 Jo u r n a l P re - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof tion into those with high immunity provided by booster or prior infection and low immunity . In fact , there is evidence showing that individuals with high immunity have relatively low risk of infection , and they are less likely to get serious illness if they do get it [ 20 , 21 ] . We consider a SEIS - type model , then , the population is divided into susceptible individuals ( S i ) , exposed individuals ( E i ) , infectious individuals with either mild symp - toms ( I im ) who may only need to admit to the isolated compartment ( Q i ) , or severe symptoms ( I is ) who need to be hospitalized for treatment , i . e . , admitted to hospitalized compartment ( H i ) , and death compartment ( D i ) . Here we use i = 1 or 2 to represent individuals with low or high immunity . We assume that mild cases that go undetected eventually recover on their own , and those who are detected are immediately isolated and then recovered after a period of isolation , but severe cases are hospitalized once detected and cannot cause further transmission , in which they may either die or recover . All infected individuals become susceptible with high immunity as soon as they recover . The model ﬂow diagram is shown in Fig 1 and the model equations are as follows .   dS 1 ( t ) dt = ω 2 S 2 − ν 1 S 1 − P 2 j = 1 c ( t ) ˆ c β 1 S 1 ( ϕ I jm + I js ) , dS 2 ( t ) dt = − ω 2 S 2 + ν 1 S 1 − P 2 j = 1 c ( t ) ˆ c β 2 S 2 ( ϕ I jm + I js ) + P 2 j = 1 ( γ Q Q j + γ H j H j + γ I m I jm ) , dE i ( t ) dt = P 2 j = 1 c ( t ) ˆ c β i S i ( ϕ I jm + I js ) − σ E i , dI im ( t ) dt = ( 1 − ρ i ) σ E i − δ ( t ) I im − ξ I m I im − γ I m I im , dI is ( t ) dt = ρ i σ E i − δ ( t ) I is − ξ I s I is , dQ i ( t ) dt = δ ( t ) I im + ξ I m I im − γ Q Q i , dH i ( t ) dt = δ ( t ) I is + ξ I s I is − γ H i H i − d i H i , dD i ( t ) dt = d i H i , ( 2 . 1 ) where S i , E i , I im , I is , Q i , H i and D i ( i = 1 , 2 ) are considered as the corresponding population proportions , ν 1 represents the rate of booster vaccination , ω 2 represents immunity waning rate , ˆ c is the baseline number of daily contacts before the COVID - 19 outbreak , β i is the infection risk given a contact between a susceptible individual S i and a serve case , ρ i denotes the probability of infected individuals who are with severe symptoms , ξ I m or ξ I s is the symptom - driven testing rate for mild or serve patients . δ ( t ) : [ 0 , ∞ ] −→ [ 0 , 1 ] is detection rate due to nucleic acid screening and c ( t ) : [ 0 , ∞ ] −→ [ 0 , 1 ] represents social distancing strategy , here c ( t ) = 1 means no social distancing , c ( t ) = 0 means complete lockdown . Functions c ( t ) and δ ( t ) represent the intensities of control measures we need to solve , and we assume that those two countermeasures are kept constant over one week , which are realistic and feasible in practice . When no NPIs are taken , i . e . , c ( t ) = 1 and δ ( t ) = 0 , the e ﬀ ective reproduction number gives R t ( t ) = ( 1 − ρ 1 ) ϕ ˆ c β 1 γ I m + ξ I m + ρ 1 ˆ c β 1 ξ I s !

( 2 . 2 ) In order to coordinate socio - economic activities and epidemic prevention and control , we need long - term , sustainable strategies to contain the spread . Then , we will establish di ﬀ erent optimal control problems ( OCPs ) based on model ( 2 . 1 ) to determine the optimal combination of social distancing strategy ( contact rate ) and 3 Jo u r n a l P re - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof 𝑺 𝟐 𝑺 𝟐 𝑰 𝟐𝒎 𝑰 𝟐𝒔 𝑸 𝟐 𝑯 𝟐 𝑫 𝟐 𝑺 𝟐 𝑺 𝟏 𝑬 𝟏 𝑰 𝟏𝒎 𝑰 𝟏𝒔 𝑸 𝟏 𝑯 𝟏 𝑫 𝟏 𝑬 𝟐 𝑺 𝟐 𝑸 𝟏 Nucleic acid screening Immunity waning Social distancing State transition process Vaccine booster shots Fig 1 : Flow diagram for a dynamic model tailored to COVID - 19 with social distancing , nucleic acid screening , and vaccination . detection rate within a given period to minimize the costs of taking countermeasures and maintain strict cap on the hospitalized beds and beds used for isolation . Let Q max and H max represent the capacities of the isolated resources and the hospital beds that can accept COVID - 19 patients respectively . Then the OCP is then given by min c , δ R T 0 ( 1 − c ( t ) ) 2 + κδ 2 ( t ) P 2 j = 1 ( S j + E j + I jm + I js ) dt , ( a ) subject to model ( 2 . 1 ) , ( b ) 0 ≤ c ( t ) ≤ 1 , ( c ) 0 ≤ δ ( t ) ≤ 1 , ( d ) N · ( H 1 ( t ) + H 2 ( t ) ) ≤ H max , ( e ) N · ( Q 1 ( t ) + Q 2 ( t ) ) ≤ Q max , ( f ) c ( t ) = c ( n ∆ t ) , t ∈ [ n ∆ t , ( n + 1 ) ∆ t ] , n = 0 , 1 , . . . , K , ( g ) δ ( t ) = δ ( n ∆ t ) , t ∈ [ n ∆ t , ( n + 1 ) ∆ t ] , n = 0 , 1 , . . . , K , ( h ) ( 2 . 3 ) where ( a ) is the objective function , which includes the normalized cost of taking social distancing to reduce contacts ( the ﬁrst term ) and the relative cost of taking nucleic acid screening to block some transmission ( the second term ) , and constant κ is the cost regulator of taking nucleic acid screening . ( c ) and ( d ) represent restric - tions on control measures . ( e ) is to prevent exceeding the maximum number of hospital beds that can accept COVID - 19 patients . ( f ) indicates that the number of quarantined persons does not exceed isolation capacity . Note that N is the total number of individuals and hence the left sides of ( e ) and ( f ) represent the numbers of individuals who seek the hospital beds or to be quarantined . ( g ) and ( h ) mean that countermeasures are kept constant over a given period ( say , ∆ t may be a week ) , K ( or T ) is the total number of weeks ( days ) considered . And in the objective function , we use ( 1 − c ( t ) ) 2 and δ 2 ( t ) to discourage very strict contact restrictions and very frequent testing in order to avoid occurring of bang - bang / singular controls , as references [ 18 , 22 , 23 ] suggested . Omicron has demonstrated an increased transmissibility relative to Delta but possibly lower clinical sever - ity than Delta [ 24 ] , and consequently ones hope to transit from COVID - 19 pandemic to endemic phase . If the 4 Jo u r n a l P re - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof mortality of COVID - 19 infections is similar to that of inﬂuenza , we may coexist with COVID - 19 through coor - dinating socioeconomic development and suitable / feasible measures . Then we further include the case fatality rate ( CFR ) at the end of our considered period as an additional restriction on the basis of the OCP ( 2 . 3 ) . In order to calculate the CFR , let’s denote the cumulative number of conﬁrmed cases by C ( t ) , then we have dC dt = 2 X j = 1 (cid:0) δ ( t ) ( I im + I is ) + ξ I m I im + ξ I s I is (cid:1) . ( 2 . 4 ) So the CFR within T days is D 1 ( T ) + D 2 ( T ) C ( T ) . The corresponding optimal control problem is min c , δ R T 0 ( 1 − c ( t ) ) 2 + κδ 2 ( t ) P 2 j = 1 ( S j + E j + I jm + I js ) dt , ( a ) subject to model ( 2 . 1 ) and ( 2 . 4 ) , ( b ) 0 ≤ c ( t ) ≤ 1 , ( c ) 0 ≤ δ ( t ) ≤ 1 , ( d ) N · ( H 1 ( t ) + H 2 ( t ) ) ≤ H max , ( e ) N · ( Q 1 ( t ) + Q 2 ( t ) ) ≤ Q max , ( f ) D 1 ( T ) + D 2 ( T ) C ( T ) ≤ r max , ( g ) c ( t ) = c ( n ∆ t ) , t ∈ [ n ∆ t , ( n + 1 ) ∆ t ] , n = 0 , 1 , . . . , K , ( h ) δ ( t ) = δ ( n ∆ t ) , t ∈ [ n ∆ t , ( n + 1 ) ∆ t ] , n = 0 , 1 , . . . , K , ( i ) ( 2 . 5 ) where ( 2 . 5 g ) indicates that the yearly CFR is less than a given level r max . Note that both OCP ( 2 . 3 ) and ( 2 . 5 ) are optimal control problems with pure state constraints [ 23 , 25 ] since constraints ( 2 . 3 ) ( e - f ) and ( 2 . 5 ) ( e - f ) do not include the controls . We use the direct method [ 12 , 26 , 27 ] , which appends to the Hamiltonian a penalty multiplier that directly multiplies the constraints , to handle pure state constraints . See Appendix A for the corresponding necessary conditions [ 27 ] and fast direct multiple shooting algorithms [ 28 ] to solve our OCPs numerically . 3 . Numerical studies Throughout the simulations , we choose parameters tailored to the COVID - 19 outbreak by Omicron variant in Xi ’an , the capital city of Shaanxi Province , China . However , we expect that the conclusions are suitable to other developed countries . We get the permanent population of Xi ’an , i . e . , N = 12952907 , and the total number of hospital beds ( which is 66 , 506 ) according to the Statistical yearbook of Xi ’an [ 29 , 30 ] , and we obtain H max = 13 , 700 = 20 % ∗ 66506 by assuming that 20 % of beds can be used for COVID - 19 patients . We let Q max = 42000 as the baseline quarantined capacity according to the ability during previous outbreak [ 31 ] , in which more than 42 , 000 people were quarantined in Xi’an city during 2021 outbreak in Shaanxi province . We hypothesize that people with high immunity will transit to low immunity after six month due to the wane of immunity [ 19 ] , that is ω 2 = 1 / 180 , and high immunity induce an 80 % reduction in being infection . Symptom - driven testing automatic rate of serve cases is 1 / 3 . 8 [ 32 ] , which means that it takes an average of 3 . 8 days for a 5 Jo u r n a l P re - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof serve case to see a doctor . We can further assume that a mild case takes 5 days to see a doctor considering its mild symptoms , i . e . , ξ I m = 1 / 5 . Here , the parameters describing disease progression meet SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron variant’s characteristics , detailed meanings and values for parameters are shown in Table 1 . We assume that the initial number of people with high immunity is about one - ﬁfth of the population size and the cost regulator κ of nucleic acid screening is equal to 2 , that is , the cost of nucleic acid screening is twice as much as the cost of social distancing . There is a evidence show that the basic reproduction number of Delta variant is 3 . 2 ( 95 % CI 2 . 0 - 4 . 8 ) according to outbreak in Guangdong Province , China [ 33 ] , and the basic reproduction number of Omicron is about 1 . 5 - 2 . 5 times that of Delta [ 34 , 35 ] . Then we can take β 1 = 0 . 2 as baseline value to make the e ﬀ ective reproduction number ( R t ( 0 ) ) in the beginning to be 6 . 55 in a population where the number of people with high immunity is one - ﬁfth of the population size , or 7 . 55 in a population with low immunity , i . e . a population that has never experienced the COVID - 19 or got a booster shot , see details in Table 1 . We would like to develop time - varying strategies over one year , so we ﬁx K = 52 and T = 364 . We numerically solve the optimal problem ( 2 . 3 ) by making use of fast tailored direct optimal control solvers [ 36 ] . In particular , we compute the gradients of the left - hand sides of the inequality constraints ( 2 . 3e ) and ( 2 . 3f ) using a continuous forward method . The simulation of all optimal control problems is completed in MATLAB with the help of open OCL - open optimal control library [ 37 ] . We will measure the impact of optimal strategies on four quantities of interest : the cumulative numbers of deaths ( D 1 ( T ) + D 2 ( T ) ) , conﬁrmed cases ( C ( T ) ) , total costs of taking countermeasures within a year ( say T ) and the e ﬀ ective reproduction numbers ( R t ( T ) ) . We also focus on the variation in solved optimal social distancing strategy ( c ∗ ( t ) ) and detection rate ( δ ∗ ( t ) ) with hospital beds and isolated resources occupancy , the e ﬀ ective reproduction number ( R t ) and the evolution of the epidemic under the optimal controls in every case . Note that the term ”optimal solutions” ( ”minimized” ) in the following refers to the notion that the best possible disease control policy is identiﬁed from a set of ”local optimal solutions” ( ”local minimized” ) that satisfy optimality conditions since iterative schemes often only guarantee local optimality [ 36 , 37 ] . 3 . 1 . Optimal control problem with limited hospital and isolation capacity We initially let H max = 13700 and Q max = 42000 ( named as the benchmark case ) to get the optimal controls and optimal solutions , shown in Fig 2 . It shows that at approximately 230th day , quarantine resources are exhausted up till about the 315th day , c ∗ ( t ) and δ ∗ ( t ) stay around 0 . 7708 and 0 . 1638 during this period , respectively . And hospital beds are never used up and the proportion of susceptible individuals with high immunity remains at 0 . 94 for most of the considered period . Note that the disease infection takes o ﬀ once the controls end at the end of our considered period . If we simply consider a constrain of the shortage of hospital beds , i . e . , without constraint ( 2 . 3f ) , it follows from Fig 2 that at approximately 90th day , hospital beds are exhausted up till the end , c ∗ ( t ) and δ ∗ ( t ) stay around 0 . 94 and 0 . 07 during considered period , respectively , which means a single constrain may allow the relatively loose strategies , compared to the optimal controls under two constrains . Note that in such scenario relatively large infections may be caused but with no run of hospital resources . Further , we notice that the obtained optimal 6 Jo u r n a l P re - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof Table 1 : Detailed meanings and values for parameters describing disease progression meet SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron variant’s characteristics .

See Fig B . 1 in Appendix B for details . And small changes in the probability of severe symptoms ( ρ 1 , ρ 2 ) have little impact on the required intensity of prevention and control measures , but have a signiﬁcant impact on the number of hospitalizations and deaths . See Fig B . 2 and Table B . 1 in Appendix B for details . To examine the variation in the optimal intensiﬁes of interventions with the capacities of isolation resources and hospital beds , we conducted the following scenarios : cases with isolation resources expanded by half ( Case I : H max = 13700 , Q max = 63000 ) , doubled ( Case II : H max = 13700 , Q max = 84000 ) and a case with the capacity of hospital beds doubled ( Case III : H max = 13700 × 2 , Q max = 42000 ) , shown in Fig 3 . It can be seen that with the increase of isolation resources , the optimal contact rate increases and detection rate decreases during the time when the quarantined resource has been fully occupied , and the time to reach the upper limit of isolation resources advances . This implies that given our control purpose , more isolation resources can allow looser 7 Jo u r n a l P re - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof 0 10 20 30 40 50 Time in weeks 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 C ou n t e r m e a s u r e s ( a ) c * ( t ) with ( 2 . 3f ) * ( t ) with ( 2 . 3f ) c * ( t ) without ( 2 . 3f ) * ( t ) without ( 2 . 3f ) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Time in days 400 5000 13700 H 1 ( t ) + H 2 ( t ) ( b ) 1 10 2 1 10 4 4 . 2 10 4 1 10 6 Q 1 ( t ) + Q 2 ( t ) H 1 ( t ) + H 2 ( t ) with ( 2 . 3f ) H 1 ( t ) + H 2 ( t ) without ( 2 . 3f ) H max Q 1 ( t ) + Q 2 ( t ) with ( 2 . 3f ) Q 1 ( t ) + Q 2 ( t ) without ( 2 . 3f ) Q max 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Time in days 0 0 . 5 1 S i ( c ) S 1 ( t ) S 2 ( t ) E 1 ( t ) E 2 ( t ) I 1m ( t ) I 2m ( t ) I 1s ( t ) I 2s ( t ) 0 2 4 E i , I i m , I i s 10 - 3 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Time in days 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 S i ( d ) S 1 ( t ) S 2 ( t ) E 1 ( t ) E 2 ( t ) I 1m ( t ) I 2m ( t ) I 1s ( t ) I 2s ( t ) 0 0 . 02 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 08 0 . 1 E i , I i m , I i s Fig 2 : Results for the OCP ( 2 . 3 ) of The benchmark case with or without constraint ( f ) . The optimal combination of social distancing strategy ( c ∗ ( t ) ) and detection rate ( δ ∗ ( t ) ) is shown in ( a ) , where the solid line corresponds to the case considering constraint ( 2 . 3f ) , and the dotted line represents the case where constraint ( 2 . 3f ) is not considered . The variation in hospital beds and isolated resources occupancy with a logarithmic scale on the vertical axis is shown in ( b ) , where the solid line corresponds to the case considering constraint ( 2 . 3f ) , and the dotted line represents the case where constraint ( 2 . 3f ) is not considered . The evolution of the epidemic under the optimal controls with or without constraint ( 2 . 3f ) is shown in ( c ) or ( d ) respectively , where the left vertical axis corresponds to evolution of susceptible individuals ( S i ) , and the right vertical axis corresponds to evolution of latent ( E i ) , mild ( I im ) , and severe ( I is ) patients ( i = 1 , 2 ) . contact restriction and less detection . Further , we list the corresponding quantities of interest for case I - III in Table 2 . This demonstrates that with the increase of isolation resources , the cumulative number of deaths further increases while the total cost of taking countermeasures decreases ( note that the cost of increasing quarantined resources is not considered here ) . That is because the more quarantine resources , the larger the scale of the infection allowed . It is interesting to note that for the benchmark case and case III , the optimal controls coincide and the corresponding quantities of interest are the same . That is to say , when the hospital capacity is increased , the optimal intensity of control measures and the scale of infections remain the same as those with baseline capacity . This means that optimal countermeasures are primarily inﬂuenced by the capacity of quarantine resources , that is because only a small number of infected individuals needs to be hospitalized , which corresponds to the fact that individuals with high ( low ) immunity have a 0 . 7 % ( 1 % ) chance of becoming seriously ill and being hospitalized once infected [ 21 ] . 3 . 2 . Optimal control problem involving inﬂuenza - based case - fatality constraints On the basis of CDC statistics on estimated inﬂuenza disease burden for past seasons ( [ 41 ] ) , the annual CFR of inﬂuenza for the period of 2015 - 2019 was approximately 0 . 09 % to 0 . 14 % . We then take this information as the case fatality restrictions when considering the OCP ( 2 . 5 ) . For comparison , we still assume that the respective capacities of isolation and hospital beds are kept at baseline levels . To analyze the inﬂuence of additional CFR restriction on optimal controls , we analyze some cases with di ﬀ erent CFR restrictions . It follows from Fig 4 that as the CFR restriction becomes loose ( i . e . , r max increases ) , 8 Jo u r n a l P re - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof 0 10 20 30 40 50 Time in weeks 0 . 7 0 . 75 0 . 8 0 . 85 0 . 9 0 . 95 C ou n t e r m e a s u r e s c * ( t ) ( a ) The benchmark case , Case III Case I Case II 0 10 20 30 40 50 Time in weeks 0 0 . 02 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 08 0 . 1 0 . 12 0 . 14 0 . 16 0 . 18 0 . 2 C ou n t e r m e a s u r e s * ( t ) ( b ) 0 100 200 300 Time in days 0 200 400 600 800 1000 H 1 ( t ) + H 2 ( t ) ( d a s h ed li n e s ) ( c ) 0 2 4 6 8 10 Q 1 ( t ) + Q 2 ( t ) ( s o li d li ne s ) 10 4 2Q max Q max 1 . 5Q max Fig 3 : Results for the OCP ( 2 . 3 ) under The benchmark case and Cases I - III .

This implies that the stricter the CFR restriction , the stricter control measures needed to be taken in the early stage , while the relatively more relaxed control measures allowed in the later stage . It corresponds to the fact that strict control measures in the early stage lead to relatively few new infections and hence the low CFR , the control measures required in late stage will then be relatively relaxed . In particular , for relatively low r max ( r max = 1 × 10 − 3 or even less ) , the number of isolated individuals ( Fig 4 ( c ) ) and the yearly CFR ( Fig 4 ( d ) ) just reach their upper limits at the end of the control period . For relatively large r max ( r max = 1 . 1 × 10 − 3 and r max = 1 . 2 × 10 − 3 ) , the optimal controls and the corresponding hospital beds and isolated resources occupancy are similar to those with the benchmark case ( see details in Fig B . 3 - B . 4 ) . This indicates that for relatively ( relaxed ) strict CFR restriction , i . e . , r max is relatively ( large ) small , the optimal controls are mainly determined by ( the isolation resources ) the limit of CFR .

And hospital beds are never used up for various restrictions of CFR ( Fig 4 ( c ) ) . The corresponding quantities of interest under these scenarios are given in Table 3 . We can get that for relatively large r max ( r max = 1 . 1 × 10 − 3 or even greater ) , the values of each indicator are the same as those in the benchmark case . And with the further decrease of r max ( r max = 1 × 10 − 3 or even less ) , the cumulative number of deaths and conﬁrmed cases decrease , while total costs of taking control measures increase . It can also be veriﬁed that the infection size and the cost under optimal countermeasures are mainly a ﬀ ected by isolation resources ( the yearly CFR restriction ) when the yearly CFR restriction is loose ( strict ) .

Moreover , if the yearly CFR restriction is relaxed from 9 × 10 − 4 to 1 × 10 − 3 , the cumulative number of deaths will increase 1 . 8 times ( Table 3 ) . This motivates us to consider scenarios in which the constraint is relaxed somewhat , and consequently the yearly CFR restriction is replaced by the quarterly CFR restriction . 10 Jo u r n a l P re - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof Then a multi - stage problem ( C . 3 ) is established based on the OCP ( 2 . 3 ) and allows you to implement discrete events where a jump in the state trajectory happens [ 37 ] , to seek the optimal prevention and control measures ( See details in Appendix C ) . In the following we initially examine the impact of seasonal restrictions on optimal controls ( see Fig 5 ) and corresponding deaths ( see case 0 in table C . 2 ) . It is worth noting that if the maximum allowable CFR is 9 × 10 − 4 , the optimal controls given quarterly CFR limit exhibit seasonal oscillations ( blue curves in Fig 5 ( a ) and ( b ) ) compared to yearly CFR limit ( yellow curves in Fig 4 ( a ) and ( b ) ) . To examine whether it is possible to relax a certain quarter or several quarters of the constraint to reduce the scale of deaths , as opposed to relaxing the yearly constraint directly , we consider the possible relaxation scenarios listed in table C . 1 and obtain the cumulative number of deaths / conﬁrmed cases listed in table C . 2 . We ﬁnd that the scale of death within a year of most cases in table C . 2 is smaller than the case with yearly CFR limit r max = 1 × 10 − 3 , especially cases 1 , 2 and 5 in table C . 2 where the CFR restrictions for the ﬁrst , second and ﬁrst two quarters were relaxed . This implies that it is better to relax the restriction for a certain quarter or several quarters rather than for the yearly restriction in terms of the scale of deaths . Besides , it follows from Fig 5 that the optimal controls for scenario 5 exhibit oscillations with averagely highest optimal contact rate and lowest detection rate . We can obtain that hospital beds are never fully occupied in any scenario , and scenario 5 requires minimal isolation resources / hospital beds . 0 13 26 39 52 Time in weeks 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 C oun t e r m ea s u r e s c * ( t ) ( a ) Case 0 Case 1 Case 2 Case 5 0 13 26 39 52 Time in weeks 0 0 . 05 0 . 1 0 . 15 0 . 2 C oun t e r m ea s u r e s * ( t ) ( b ) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Time in days 0 100 200 300 400 500 H 1 ( t ) + H 2 ( t ) ( da s hed li ne s ) ( c ) 0 1 2 3 4 5 Q 1 ( t ) + Q 2 ( t ) ( s o li d li ne s ) 10 4 0 13 26 39 52 Time in weeks 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 1 . 2 C F R 10 - 3 ( d ) Q max Fig 5 : Results for the multi - stage problem under cases 0 or 1 , 2 , 5 where strict limits are maintained every quarter or the CFR restrictions for the ﬁrst , second and ﬁrst two quarters were relaxed .

E ﬀ ect of booster vaccination on optimal controls In order to explore the e ﬀ ect of booster vaccination on optimal controls , we initially analyze the impact of increasing vaccination rates . We re - solve the OCP ( 2 . 3 ) when the vaccination rate ( v 1 ) increases from 0 . 1 ( Table 1 ) to 0 . 12 and 0 . 15 while keeping the baseline restrictions for isolation and hospital capacity , respectively , as shown in Fig 6 and 7 . It follows from Fig 6 that the higher the rate of booster vaccination , the weaker the prevention and control measures required ; the later the restriction of quarantine resources been reached . And Fig 7 ( a - b ) shows that the higher the rate of booster vaccination , the more ( less ) the susceptible population with high ( low ) immunity . 0 10 20 30 40 50 Time in weeks 0 . 7 0 . 75 0 . 8 0 . 85 0 . 9 0 . 95 C oun t e r m ea s u r e s c * ( t ) ( a ) v 1 = 0 . 1 , Q max = 42000 v 1 = 0 . 12 , Q max = 42000 v 1 = 0 . 15 , Q max = 42000 v 1 = 0 . 12 , Q max = 21000 0 10 20 30 40 50 Time in weeks 0 0 . 02 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 08 0 . 1 0 . 12 0 . 14 0 . 16 0 . 18 0 . 2 C oun t e r m ea s u r e s * ( t ) ( b ) 0 100 200 300 Time in days 0 100 200 300 400 500 H 1 ( t ) + H 2 ( t ) ( da s h ed li n e s ) ( c ) 0 1 2 3 4 5 Q 1 ( t ) + Q 2 ( t ) ( s o l i d li ne s ) 10 4 Q max = 21000 Q max = 42000 Fig 6 : ( a ) and ( b ) : Optimal combination of social distancing strategy ( c ∗ ( t ) ) and detection rate ( δ ∗ ( t ) ) with di ﬀ erent v 1 and Q max ; ( c ) : Hospital beds and isolated resources occupancy under di ﬀ erent v 1 and Q max . 0 100 200 300 364 Time in days 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 S 1 10 6 ( a ) 240 260 280 300 320 340 360 4 4 . 5 5 5 . 5 6 6 . 5 7 10 5 0 100 200 300 364 Time in days 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 S 2 10 6 ( b ) v 1 = 0 . 1 , Q max = 42000 v 1 = 0 . 12 , Q max = 42000 v 1 = 0 . 15 , Q max = 42000 v 1 = 0 . 12 , Q max = 21000 240 260 280 300 320 340 360 1 . 21 1 . 22 1 . 23 1 . 24 1 . 25 10 7 Fig 7 : The evolution of S 1 ( a ) and S 2 ( b ) under corresponding optimal controls with di ﬀ erent v 1 and Q max . In addition , the corresponding quantities of interest under various vaccination rates are given in Table 2 . It shows that the higher the rate of booster vaccination , the lower the cumulative number of deaths , the lower 12 Jo u r n a l P re - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof the total cost of taking control strategies , and the lower the e ﬀ ective reproduction number at time T . And increasing vaccination rate by 20 % and reducing the restriction of isolation resources by half ( i . e . , v 1 = 0 . 12 and Q max = 21000 ) will lead to a ( signiﬁcant decrease ) decrease in ( the death toll ) the total cost . This suggests that e ﬀ ective and available vaccines can contribute to reducing control costs , relaxing control measures , alleviating medical resources and reducing the infection scales . As a particular case we consider the case with no booster , i . e . , v 1 = 0 ( Fig 8 ) . Subplot ( b ) of Fig 8 shows that the optimal contact rate c ∗ ( t ) is obvious piece - wise functions with switching between 0 and certain levels , which corresponds to lockdown measure , opening , re - lockdown and re - opening and so on . In particular , Fig 8 ( b ) shows that lockdown needs to be implemented at week 7 , 9 , 12 , 15 , . . . , and Fig 8 ( c ) shows that the total number of quarantined individuals reaches the restriction at the end of week 7 , 9 , 12 , 15 , . . . , and hospital beds never run out . This means that given no booster , all the isolation resources will occupy when the lockdown measure ends . Note that the e ﬀ ective reproduction numbers R t under optimal countermeasures show no tendency of decrease , shown in Fig 8 ( d ) , indicating that the infection may not be controlled . A case with the quite low booster rate v 1 = 0 . 001 is also shown in Appendix D , and similar conclusions can be drawn . This indicates that given no vaccination or very low booster rate , intermittent lockdowns can ensure the isolated / hospitalized individuals no greater than the capacities in exchange for at least four times the cost of the benchmark case ( Table 2 ) , suggesting that vaccination and e ﬀ ective booster shots play a vital role in helping realize the smooth transition from a pandemic to an endemic phase and avoiding lockdown measures . To further analyze what intensity vaccination rates are e ﬀ ective in terms of avoiding lockdowns , we focus on the optimal combinations of social distancing strategy ( c ∗ ( t ) ) and detection rate ( δ ∗ ( t ) ) for the OCP ( 2 . 3 ) under the benchmark case with di ﬀ erent v 1 , shown in Fig 9 . It shows that when the rate of vaccination v 1 reaches 0 . 01 , no lockdown is necessary , and to keep people as half mobility as they were before the pandemic , the vaccination rate of 0 . 02 is needed . 4 . Discussion Designing our own path to smoothly transit from the COVID - 19 pandemic to an endemic phase is chal - lenging , given high susceptibility , persist vaccination wanning , and relatively weak strength of health systems . In this study , we proposed a novel mathematical model with waning of immunity and examined the optimal con - tact rate and detection rate such that the cost is minimized , and as well as the number of hospitalized / isolated individuals no greater than the hospital / isolation capacity . Under the solved , optimal and dynamic intensiﬁes of social distancing and detecting , the health system keeps normal operated , and hence these measures can act as our normalized control strategies which becomes a feasible transition path from a pandemic to an endemic phase has been suggested . There are evidences showing that the quarantining of infected individuals or people who need specially monitoring [ 42 , 43 ] and providing more adequate medical resources are critical to mitigating the outbreak [ 12 , 44 ] . On the basis of reasonable parameter values tailored for Xi’an , the capital city of Shaanxi province , our study made it clear that it is the restriction of isolation resource rather than the capacity of hospital beds that signiﬁcantly a ﬀ ects the optimal intensiﬁes of contact reduction and detection .

When looking for the path of transition from a pandemic to an endemic , ones hope that the develop trend and / or death rate of infection caused by a novel variant are similar to those for inﬂuenza . We then further considered an additional restriction determined by the CFR of inﬂuenza and found that for relatively small ( large ) yearly CFR , the optimal controls are mainly determined by CFR ( the isolation capacity ) . And the optimal controls under quarterly CFR restriction may show oscillations , and relaxing quarterly CFR restriction may cause a relatively low death rate . In particular , we analyzed the impacts of booster vaccination , we obtained that if there is no booster or vaccination rate is extremely low , the optimal contact rates are obvious piece - wise functions with switching between 0 and certain levels . That is to say the optimal strategy is a control mode switching between lock down and opening with certain social distancing , demonstrating that vaccination and e ﬀ ective booster shots play a vital role in helping realize the smooth transition from a pandemic to an endemic phase and avoiding lockdown measures . This also reﬂects the importance and necessity of China’s static management on a certain area during Covid - 19 outbreak . What the problem has been solved in this study is to ﬁnd the optimal countermeasures within a ﬁxed planning horizon . This could lead to the phenomenon that disease infection takes o ﬀ at the end of control . We may solve this problem by adding a terminal term about the number of infected people at the end of control to the objective function or some terminal state constraints about the fraction of infected people . We leave this for future work . Funding Source This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( grant number : 12031010 ) .

Necessary conditions for a general problem and fast direct multiple shooting algorithms for optimal control problems We consider the following optimal control problem : min µ R T 0 F ( x , µ , t ) dt , ( a ) subject to ˙ x ( t ) = f ( x , µ , t ) , x ( 0 ) = x 0 ( b ) g ( x , µ , t ) ≤ 0 , ( c ) h ( x , t ) ≤ 0 , ( d ) a ( x ( T ) , T ) ≤ 0 , ( e ) ( A . 1 ) where state x ( t ) ∈ R n , control µ ( t ) ∈ R m , functions F from E n × E m × E into E , f from E n × E m × E into E n , g from E n × E m × E into E q , h from E n × E into E p and a from E n × E n × E into E n . The special cases of the mixed constraint g ( x , µ , t ) ≤ 0 are µ i ∈ [ N i , M i ] with N i < M i , where M i and N i are constants . And this situation is the one covered in this article . We ﬁrst give some relevant notations . An interval ( θ 1 , θ 2 ) ⊂ [ 0 , T ] with θ 1 < θ 2 is called an interior interval if h i ( x ( t ) , t ) < 0 , ∀ t ∈ ( θ 1 , θ 2 ) . If the optimal trajectory satisﬁes h i ( x ( t ) , t ) = 0 for τ 1 ≤ t ≤ τ 2 for some i , then [ τ 1 , τ 2 ] is called a boundary interval . And the instant τ 1 is called an entry time if there is an interior interval ending at t = τ 1 and a boundary interval starting at τ 1 . τ 2 is called an exit time if a boundary interval ends and an interior interval starts at τ 2 . The time τ is a contact time for x if it is an isolated point such that h ( x ( τ ) , τ ) = 0 . The entry , exit and contact times are called junction times . In order to formulate the minimum principle for the problem ( A . 1 ) , we deﬁne the Hamiltonian function H d : E n × E m × E 1 → E 1 as H d = F ( x , µ , t ) + λ d f ( x , µ , t ) ; ( A . 2 ) and the Lagrangian function L d : E n × E m × E n × E q × E q × E 1 → E 1 as L d ( x , µ , λ d , ψ , η d , t ) = H d ( x , µ , λ d , t ) + ψ g ( x , µ , t ) + η d h ( x , t ) . ( A . 3 ) According to Theorem 9 . 3 . 1 in [ 45 ] or [ 27 ] , we have the following minimum theorem underlying the direct method . Theorem 1 . Let ( µ ∗ , x ∗ ) be an optimal pair of functions . Then there exist an adjoint function λ d , which may be discontinuous at a time in a boundary interval or a contact time , multiplier functions ψ , α , γ d , η d , and a jump parameter ζ d ( t ) at each time τ where λ d is discontinuous , such that the followings conditions hold : ( a ) ˙ x ∗ = f ( x ∗ , µ ∗ , t ) , x ∗ ( 0 ) = x 0 , satisfying constraints g ( x ∗ , µ ∗ , t ) ≤ 0 , h ( x ∗ , t ) ≤ 0 , and the terminal constraints a ( x ∗ ( T ) , T ) ≤ 0 ; ( b ) the adjoint equation ˙ λ d = − L x [ x ∗ , µ ∗ , λ d , ψ , η d , t ] with the transversality conditions λ d ( T − ) = α a x ( x ∗ ( T ) , T ) + γ d h x ( x ∗ ( T ) , T ) , and α ≥ 0 , α a ( x ∗ ( T ) , T ) = 0 , γ d ≥ 0 , γ d h ( x ∗ ( T ) , T ) = 0 ; 18 Jo u r n a l P re - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof ( c ) the Hamiltonian minimizing condition H d [ x ∗ ( t ) , µ ∗ ( t ) , λ d ( t ) , t ] ≤ H d [ x ∗ ( t ) , µ , λ d ( t ) , t ] at each t ∈ [ 0 , T ] for all µ satisfying g [ x ∗ , µ , t ] ≤ 0 ; ( d ) the jump conditions at any time τ , where λ d is discontinuous , are λ d ( τ − ) = λ d ( τ + ) + ζ d ( τ ) h x ( x ∗ ( τ ) , τ ) and H d [ x ∗ ( τ ) , µ ∗ ( τ − ) , λ d ( τ − ) , τ ] = H d [ x ∗ ( τ ) , µ ∗ ( τ + ) , λ d ( τ + ) , τ ] − ζ d h t ( x ∗ ( τ ) , τ ) ; ( e ) the Lagrange multipliers µ ( t ) are such that ∂ L d ∂µ | µ = µ ∗ = 0 , dH d dt = dL d dt = ∂ L d ∂ t ; ( f ) the complementary slackness conditions ψ ( t ) ≥ 0 , ψ ( t ) g ( x ∗ , µ ∗ , t ) = 0 , η ( t ) ≥ 0 , η ( t ) h ( x ∗ ( t ) , t ) = 0 , and ζ d ( τ ) ≥ 0 , ζ d ( τ ) h ( x ∗ ( τ ) , τ ) = 0 hold . Let’s use OCP ( 2 . 5 ) as an example . Let x = ( x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x 15 ) = ( S 1 , E 1 , I 1 m , I 1 s , Q 1 , H 1 , D 1 , S 2 , E 2 , I 2 m , I 2 s , Q 2 , H 2 , D 2 , C ) denote the state variables and µ ( t ) = ( δ ( t ) , c ( t ) ) denote control variables . The ordinary di ﬀ erential equations de - scribing the development of the disease at each stage satisfy equations ( 2 . 1 ) and ( 2 . 4 ) , which are denoted as ˙ x ( t ) = f ( x ( t ) , µ ( t ) , t ) . ( A . 4 ) Then the objective function is F ( x , µ , t ) = ( 1 − c ( t ) ) 2 + κδ 2 ( t ) P 2 j = 1 ( S j + E j + I jm + I js ) . The corresponding constraints are g ( x , µ , t ) =  − c ( t ) c ( t ) − 1 − δ ( t ) δ ( t ) − 1  , h ( x , t ) =  N · ( H 1 + H 2 ) − H max N · ( Q 1 + Q 2 ) − Q max  . The terminal constraint is a ( x ( T ) , T ) = D 1 ( T ) + D 2 ( T ) − r max C ( T ) . Direct methods are basic approaches to address optimal control problems , which transform the original inﬁnite optimal control problem into a ﬁnite dimensional nonlinear programming problem ( NLP ) . Among them , the direct multiple shooting method is the method of choice for nonlinear optimal control problems [ 28 ] . In our paper , we assumed our controls are piecewise constant ( see ( 2 . 3 ) ( g - h ) ) , i . e . , µ ( t ) = ( δ qn , c qn ) . = q n for t ∈ [ n ∆ t , ( n + 1 ) ∆ t ] . Then , we solve the ODE on each interval [ n ∆ t , ( n + 1 ) ∆ t ] independently , starting with an artiﬁcial initial value s n : ˙ x n ( t ) = f ( x n ( t ) , q n ) , t ∈ [ n ∆ t , ( n + 1 ) ∆ t ] with x n ( n ∆ t ) = s n . 19 Jo u r n a l P re - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof The corresponding trajectory pieces denoted as x n ( t ; s n , q n ) and the integrals follows l n ( s n , q n ) = Z ( n + 1 ) ∆ t n ∆ t F ( x n ( t ; s n , q n ) , q n , t ) dt . Thus , we arrive at the following NLP formulation : min µ P N − 1 n = 0 l n ( s n , q n ) subject to s 0 − x 0 = 0 , ( initial value ) s n + 1 − x n ( ( n + 1 ) ∆ t ; s n , q n ) = 0 , n = 0 , . . , N − 1 , ( continuity ) − g ( x n , q n , t ) ≥ 0 , n = 0 , . . , N , ( discretized path constraints ) − h ( x n , t ) ≥ 0 , n = 0 , . . , N , ( discretized path constraints ) − a ( s N , T ) ≥ 0 . ( terminal constraints ) ( A . 5 ) If we denoted all variables as w = ( s 0 , q 0 , s 1 , q 1 , . . . , s N , q N ) , the following ﬁnite dimensional NLP can be obtained [ 28 ] . min w a ( w ) subject to b ( w ) = 0 , c ( w ) ≥ 0 . Then , we can use an iterative Sequential Quadratic Programming to solve this form of NLP [ 46 ] . Appendix B . Supplementary drawing For relatively strict measures ( c ∗ ( t ) ≡ 0 . 77 and δ ∗ ( t ) ≡ 0 . 16 ) , we obtain that neither the isolation resources nor the number of hospital beds would be used up ( shown in Fig B . 1 ( b ) ) , while the total cost of interventions is relatively high ; for relatively loose measures ( c ∗ ( t ) ≡ 0 . 8 and δ ∗ ( t ) ≡ 0 . 14 ) , we ﬁnd that although the number of hospital beds would not be used up , but at least 2 . 7 × 10 5 isolated beds are needed for mild cases , more than six times as the isolation capacity ( Fig B . 1 ( a ) ) . Those mean that any combination of constant controls are not indeed as well as our solved optimal and dynamic control in terms of contribution to our objectives . 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Time in days 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 H 1 ( t ) + H 2 ( t ) ( a ) 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 3 Q 1 ( t ) + Q 2 ( t ) 10 5 Q max 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Time in days 0 50 H 1 ( t ) + H 2 ( t ) ( b ) 0 5000 Q 1 ( t ) + Q 2 ( t ) Fig B . 1 : The variation in hospital beds and isolated resources occupancy when countermeasures are more lax ( ( a ) : c ∗ ( t ) ≡ 0 . 8 and δ ∗ ( t ) ≡ 0 . 14 ) or more restrictive , ( ( b ) : c ∗ ( t ) ≡ 0 . 77 and δ ∗ ( t ) ≡ 0 . 16 ) than the optimal combination of social distancing strategy and detection rate in Fig 2 ( a ) .

The corresponding quantities of interest are listed in Table B . 1 . This shows that small changes in the probability of severe symptoms ( ρ 1 , ρ 2 ) have little impact on the required intensity of prevention and control measures , but have a signiﬁcant impact on the number of hospitalizations and deaths . 0 10 20 30 40 50 Time in weeks 0 . 74 0 . 76 0 . 78 0 . 8 0 . 82 0 . 84 0 . 86 0 . 88 0 . 9 0 . 92 C oun t e r m ea s u r e s c ( t ) ( a ) 0 . 1 1 , 0 . 1 2 0 . 5 1 , 0 . 5 2 1 , 2 1 . 5 1 , 1 . 5 2 2 1 , 2 2 0 10 20 30 40 50 Time in weeks 0 0 . 02 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 08 0 . 1 0 . 12 0 . 14 0 . 16 C oun t e r m ea s u r e s ( t ) ( b ) 0 100 200 300 Time in days 0 200 400 600 800 1000 H 1 ( t ) + H 2 ( t ) ( da s hed li ne s ) ( c ) 0 1 2 3 4 5 Q 1 ( t ) + Q 2 ( t ) ( s o li d li ne s ) 10 4 Fig B . 2 : Results for the OCP ( 2 . 3 ) under The benchmark case with di ﬀ erent probability of severe symptoms .

It shows that the optimal controls and the corresponding hospital beds and isolated resources occupancy are similar to those with the benchmark case . Appendix C . A multi - stage problem We now extend the OCP ( 2 . 3 ) to establish multi - stage problems ( also called multi - phase problems ) , which allows you to implement discrete events where a jump in the state trajectory happens [ 37 ] , to seek the optimal prevention and control measures .

The risk of infection in di ﬀ erent stages is indicated by β il ( l = 1 , 2 ; i = 1 , · · · , M ) , where the subscript l represents the susceptible population with high or low level of immunity , and superscript i represents the i th stage . The ordinary di ﬀ erential equations describing the development of the disease at each stage satisfy equations ( 2 . 1 ) and ( 2 . 4 ) , which are denoted as X 0 i ( t ) = f ( X i ( t ) , µ i ( t ) , β il ) , ( C . 2 ) where X 0 i ( t ) . = dX i dt and i = 1 , · · · , M . Then the corresponding multi - stage optimal control problem is expressed as : min c 1 , . . . , cM δ 1 , . . . , δ M P Mi = 1 (cid:18)R T i T i − 1 (cid:16) ( 1 − c i ( t ) ) 2 + κδ 2 i ( t ) P 2 j = 1 ( S ij + E ij + I ijm + I ijs ) (cid:17) dt (cid:19) , ( a ) subject to for i ∈ { 1 , . . . , M } X 0 i ( t ) = f ( X i ( t ) , µ i ( t ) , β il ) , ( b ) D i 1 ( T i ) + D i 2 ( T i ) C i ( T i ) ≤ r imax , ( c ) 0 ≤ δ i ( t ) ≤ δ max , s max ≤ c i ( t ) < 1 ( d ) N · ( H i 1 ( t ) + H i 2 ( t ) ) ≤ H max , ( e ) N · ( Q i 1 ( t ) + Q i 2 ( t ) ) ≤ Q max , ( f ) c i ( t ) = c i ( n ∆ t ) , t ∈ [ n ∆ t , ( n + 1 ) ∆ t ] , n = 0 , 1 , . . . , K , K ∆ t = T i − T i − 1 ( g ) δ i ( t ) = δ i ( n ∆ t ) , t ∈ [ n ∆ t , ( n + 1 ) ∆ t ] , n = 0 , 1 , . . . , K , K ∆ t = T i − T i − 1 ( h ) for i ∈ { 1 , . . . , M − 1 } X i + 1 j ( T i ) = X ij ( T i ) for j ∈ { 1 , . . . , 6 , 8 , . . . , 13 } , ( i ) X i + 1 j = 0 for j ∈ { 7 , 14 , 15 } , ( g ) ( C . 3 ) where ( c ) indicates that the staged CFR does not exceed the corresponding upper limit r imax and ( d ) represents restrictions on control measures of each stage . Equations ( i ) and ( g ) represent the relationship between the initial value of the equation describing the next stage and the corresponding compartment value at the end of the previous stage . Specially , equations ( i ) means that the ﬁrst state X i + 1 j of stage i + 1 is equivalent to the last stage X ij of stage i at timepoint T i . In the following simulation we consider four quarters in a year to illustrate . We let 0 < δ ( t ) < δ max = 0 . 2 , s max = 0 . 6 < c ( t ) < 1 and r imax < 1 . 1 × 10 − 3 to further limit the intensity of countermeasures and the quarterly CFR restrictions ( r imax , i = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) respectively , which is determined by the results of OCP ( 2 . 5 ) . We still ﬁxed β i 1 = 0 . 2 ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) and β i 2 = 0 . 2 β i 1 . We ﬁrst examine the impact of considering seasonal restrictions on optimal controls and corresponding deaths . The corresponding quantities of interest under some cases with same seasonal limits ( case 0 and 15 in 23 Jo u r n a l P re - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof table C . 1 ) are given in case 0 and 15 in table C . 2 . It is worth noting that if the maximum allowable CFR is 9 × 10 − 4 , the optimal controls given quarterly CFR limit exhibit seasonal oscillations ( blue curves in Fig 5 ( a ) and ( b ) ) compared to yearly CFR limit ( yellow curves in Fig 4 ( a ) and ( b ) ) , and the cumulative number of deaths and conﬁrmed cases in a year are greater for quarterly CFR limit ( case 0 in table C . 2 ) than those for yearly CFR limit ( r max = 9 × 10 − 4 in table 2 ) . While for relatively loose CFR limit ( say , 1 × 10 − 3 ) , the numbers of deaths and total costs in a year do not di ﬀ er much between the yearly ( ( r max = 9 × 10 − 3 in table 3 ) or quarterly CFR limits ( case 15 in table C . 2 ) . To investigate the e ﬀ ect of various quarterly CFR limits on optimal controls and cumulative number of deaths / conﬁrmed cases , and examining whether it is possible to relax a certain quarter or several quarters of the constraint to save on the cost of countermeasures or reduce the scale of deaths , as opposed to relaxing the yearly constraint directly , we consider the possible relaxation scenarios listed in table C . 1 and obtain the cumulative number of deaths / conﬁrmed cases listed in table C . 2 . We ﬁnd that the scale of death in a year of most cases in table C . 2 was smaller than the case with yearly CFR limit r max = 1 × 10 − 3 , which means that it is better to relax the restriction for a certain quarter or several quarters rather than to relax the yearly restriction in terms of the scale of deaths . It is worth noting that scenarios 1 , 2 , and 5 ( bold black font in table C . 2 ) not only reduce the number of deaths ( by 3 . 17 % , 0 . 51 % and 4 . 52 % , respectively ) and conﬁrmed cases ( by 3 . 31 % , 0 . 98 % and 4 . 97 % , respec - tively ) within a year , but also resulted in cost savings ( by 4 . 40 % , 4 . 73 % and 7 . 26 % , respectively ) compared to scenario 0 , and scenario 5 has the largest reduction in death toll ( or conﬁrmed cases ) and cost . It shows from Fig 5 that the optimal controls for scenario 5 exhibit oscillations with averagely highest optimal contact rate and lowest detection rate . We can obtain that hospital beds are never fully occupied in any scenario , and scenario 5 requires minimal isolation resources / hospital beds in these four scenarios . Moreover , by comparing scenario 15 with the most relaxed case per quarter , both scenario 10 and 14 not only have more deaths and infections in a year than scenario 15 , but also their costs within a year are more than that for scenario 15 , and hence are less feasible or undesirable . Fig C . 1 shows the variation of the optimal social distancing strategy ( a ) and detection rates ( b ) , hospital beds and isolated resources occupancy ( c ) and the CFR within t days of each quarter for scenarios 10 , 14 , 15 . We can ﬁnd that the consumption of medical resources in these cases is far more than that in case 0 . Appendix D . Results for the OCP ( 2 . 3 ) with di ﬀ erent v 1 = 0 . 001 Results for the OCP ( 2 . 3 ) when v 1 = 0 . 001 are shown in Fig D . 1 . Subplots ( b ) of Fig D . 1 shows that the optimal contact rate c ∗ ( t ) is obvious piece - wise functions with switching between 0 and certain levels , which corresponds to lockdown measure , opening , re - lockdown and re - opening and so on . Note that the e ﬀ ective re - production numbers R t under optimal countermeasures show no tendency of decrease , shown in Fig D . 1 ( d ) , in - dicating that the infection may not be controlled , which is also consistent with oscillations of the corresponding optimal solutions ( shown in Fig D . 1 ( a ) ) . This indicates that given very low booster rate , intermittent lockdowns can ensure the isolated / hospitalized individuals no greater than the capacities in exchange for at least four times 24 Jo u r n a l P re - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof 0 13 26 39 52 Time in weeks 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 C oun t e r m ea s u r e s c * ( t ) ( a ) Case 0 Case 10 Case 14 Case 15 0 13 26 39 52 Time in weeks 0 0 . 05 0 . 1 0 . 15 0 . 2 C oun t e r m ea s u r e s * ( t ) ( b ) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Time in days 0 100 200 300 400 500 H 1 ( t ) + H 2 ( t ) ( da s hed li ne s ) ( c ) 0 1 2 3 4 5 Q 1 ( t ) + Q 2 ( t ) ( s o li d li ne s ) 10 4 0 13 26 39 52 Time in weeks 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 1 . 2 C F R 10 - 3 ( d ) Q max Fig C . 1 : Results for the OCP ( C . 3 ) under cases 0 , 10 , 14 , 15 when β i 1 = 0 . 2 ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) .
