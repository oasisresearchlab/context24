Membrane tension and peripheral protein density mediate membrane shape transitions Zheng Shi 1 and Tobias Baumgart 1 , * 1 Department of Chemistry , University of Pennsylvania , 231 S . 34th St . , Philadelphia , PA 19104 , USA Abstract Endocytosis is a ubiquitous eukaryotic membrane budding , vesiculation , and internalization process fulfilling numerous roles including compensation of membrane area increase after bursts of exocytosis . The mechanism of the coupling between these two processes to enable homeostasis is not well understood . Recently , an ultrafast endocytosis ( UFE ) pathway was revealed with a speed significantly exceeding classical clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) . Membrane tension reduction is a potential mechanism by which endocytosis can be rapidly activated at remote sites . Here we provide experimental evidence for a mechanism whereby membrane tension reduction initiates membrane budding and tubulation mediated by endocytic proteins such as endophilin A1 . We find that shape instabilities occur at well - defined membrane tensions and surface densities of endophilin . From our data , we obtain a membrane shape stability diagram that shows remarkable consistency with a quantitative model . This model applies to all laterally diffusive curvature coupling proteins and therefore a wide range of endocytic proteins . Introduction The cellular processing of signals and cargo is accompanied by the formation of transient , highly curved membrane structures such as tubules and vesicles 1 . One of the best understood membrane transport processes is CME . Among other contributors 2 , several types of BAR domain proteins , including endophilin , help induce or stabilize the curvature of clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCV ) 3 . During clathrin - independent endocytosis , plasma membrane retrieval is modulated by the actions of endophilin and dynamin 4 . Here we correlate the onset of membrane deformation with the number density of BAR - domain proteins on the membrane , and evaluate how membrane tension modifies that relationship . Cellular membrane tensions arise from two primary sources : hydrostatic pressure across the lipid bilayer and cytoskeleton - membrane adhesion 5 . These tensions span a range of values from 0 . 003 mN·m −1 to around 0 . 3 mN·m −1 , depending on cell type and Users may view , print , copy , and download text and data - mine the content in such documents , for the purposes of academic research , subject always to the full Conditions of use : http : / / www . nature . com / authors / editorial _ policies / license . html # terms * To whom correspondence should be addressed : T .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t state 5 – 7 . Cells actively maintain their unique membrane tensions and the idea that tension is a regulator of biological processes such as endocytosis has gained attention since the late 1990s 5 , 8 with significantly more contributions in recent years 6 , 9 – 17 . However , in experiments with biological cells , the magnitude of tension has only been coarsely controlled , if it was controlled at all . Results We first investigated membrane deformation through the N - terminal BAR domain of endophilin , and then compared these measurements to those obtained with full length endophilin . To enable tension - controlled measurements , a single micropipette - aspirated giant unilamellar vesicle ( GUV , labelled with red fluorophores ) , consisting of a spherical part and an aspirated part ( Fig . 1a ) , was transferred into a solution containing endophilin N - BAR domains ( labelled with a green fluorophore ) ( Fig . 1b ) 18 . The protein / membrane binding process was quantified by measuring the increase of green fluorescence signal on the GUV contour , which was converted into the molecular density of proteins on the membrane ( see Methods ) via a calibration method 19 . Simultaneously , the geometry ( aspiration length L p and vesicle radius R v , see Fig . 1a ) of the GUV was monitored in order to document membrane budding / tubulation transitions induced by N - BAR domain binding . Diameters of membrane tubes induced by N - BAR domains are typically below optical resolution 20 , rendering them challenging to image directly , especially during their emergence . However , in our setup , the change in GUV geometry provides a precise indicator for the onset of the membrane shape transition . Effects of protein density and membrane tension When a certain amount of endophilin N - BAR domains was bound on the GUV membrane , the aspiration length L p decreased and membrane tubes grew towards the vesicle exterior until all pipette - aspirated membrane area was consumed ( aspiration length L p = 0 ) ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Figure 1 ) . The observed membrane tube formation is consistent with the known capacity of N - BAR proteins to generate membrane curvature 21 . In contrast to the tubulation and corresponding GUV geometry change observed at a membrane tension of 0 . 05 mN·m −1 ( Fig . 1c ) , we found that the endophilin N - BAR induced shape instability can be suppressed ( Fig . 1d ) by subjecting vesicles to larger lateral tensions ( ≥ 0 . 25 mN·m −1 , see Supplementary theory ) . In order to investigate how membrane tension affects tubulation , GUVs covered with endophilin N - BAR were subjected to a range of tensions by varying the pipette aspiration pressures . A vesicle under high tension was first equilibrated in the protein chamber to ensure constant coverage of endophilin N - BAR domain , while suppressing tubulation . The tension of the vesicle was then decreased about threefold within two seconds . When the GUV experienced lower membrane tension , membrane tubes emerged around the vesicle , concomitant with a decrease in L p ( Fig . 1d ) . Monitoring vesicle radius and aspiration length allows assessing reductions of visible membrane area as growing tubes consume membrane area from the vesicle geometry . Both the protein - induced and tension change - induced membrane tubulations are correlated with a Shi and Baumgart Page 2 Nat Commun . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2015 July 08 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t decrease in visible GUV membrane area , as calculated from changes in aspiration length and vesicle radius ( Fig . 2 and Supplementary Figure 2 , also see Methods ) . However , besides tubulation , the visible membrane area decrease induced by tension reduction has an additional contribution from entropic membrane fluctuations . We show and discuss in Supplementary Figure 3 that effects related to membrane fluctuations are substantially smaller than protein effects . Determining a shape stability diagram To obtain an experimental membrane shape stability diagram correlating protein density and membrane tension at the shape transition , GUVs aspirated at a range of membrane tensions were transferred into endophilin N - BAR solutions ( Fig . 2 ) . Potential osmotic contributions to changes in vesicle geometry were carefully excluded ( Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 4 ) . Consistently , we observed formation of membrane tubes , and the associated decrease in visible membrane area , only after the protein density on GUVs reached a well - defined threshold level , indicating the existence of a protein transition - density required for inducing membrane tubulation . We define the transition - density as the protein density at which visible membrane area of GUVs begins to decrease , as indicated by the arrows in Figure 2 . The transition - density has no observable dependence on the protein concentration in the bulk solution ( Supplementary Figure 5a ) . However , comparison between a high tension GUV ( Fig . 2a ) and a low tension GUV ( Fig . 2b ) reveals a striking influence of membrane tension on the transition - density with minimal effect on protein - membrane binding ( Supplementary Figure 5b ) . We constructed a membrane shape stability diagram by systematically determining the transition - densities of the protein for GUVs under various membrane tensions ( Fig . 3 ) . This stability diagram was obtained for GUVs with the composition DOPS / DOPE / DOPC = 45 / 30 / 25 with membrane - bound endophilin N - BAR domains . This lipid composition was chosen to mimic the innerleaflet headgroup composition of plasma membranes , where endocytic events take place 22 . Di - oleoyl lipid chains were chosen in order to suppress demixing of lipid mixtures . We found that full length endophilin shows a qualitatively similar membrane tubulation behaviour as its N - BAR domain , albeit with higher transition - densities compared to the N - BAR domain ( Fig . 4 ) , consistent with a potential auto - inhibition of endophilin function 23 . The stability diagram ( Fig . 3 ) illustrates how two factors , density increase ( horizontal arrows ) and tension decrease ( vertical arrows ) , can be used to control the transformation of lipid membranes from a planar ( white ) to tubular ( dark gray ) state . These two trajectories in the stability diagram correspond to the scenarios in Figure 1c and Figure 1d respectively . The stability diagram shows a positive intercept ρ 0 of the stability boundary on the x - axis ( displaying number density of N - BAR dimers on the membrane ) . This is consistent with the fact that at vanishing membrane tension , GUVs with identical lipid compositions in both leaflets are stable towards tubulation in the absence of curvature - inducing proteins . Analytical model based on three adjustable parameters We next aim to fit a biophysical model to our data , with the goal to illuminate molecular details of the curvature instability induced by endophilin . We seek the following features of Shi and Baumgart Page 3 Nat Commun . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2015 July 08 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t a suitable model : a ) it should allow for locally varying protein densities on the membrane in a temperature - dependent manner , to account for entropic contributions to shape stability ; b ) it should feature a coupling between local protein density and membrane curvature ; c ) the exact geometry of the membrane after deformation does not need to be prescribed by the model , because we focus on the onset of the shape instability . While several theories have been developed to explain spontaneous budding / tubulation of membranes 24 – 26 , only the linear stability theory 27 used in the following is consistent with the requirements listed above . Note that the shape of the membrane after undergoing the instability would have to be described with a non - linear approach 28 . Using σ to represent the membrane tension , and ϕ̄ to represent the average cover fraction of proteins on the membrane ( experimentally the cover fraction is obtained by dividing the measured N - BAR dimer density to its close - packed density ρ max = 30000 µm −2 29 ) , the instability criterion can be written as ( see Supplementary theory for details ) , ( 1 ) Here κ is the bending rigidity , C 0 describes the spontaneous curvature of the membrane induced by protein binding ( positive for N - BAR domains ) , k B is the Boltzmann constant and the T is the temperature . The parameter b is normally a constant and can be expressed in a simple lattice model as b = λ ( β k B T ) −1 where β is the excluded area of the protein and λ represents an effective ‘interaction area’ for molecular interactions in a protein density gradient 30 . The parameter α represents the attraction strength between protein molecules in the two - dimensional Van der Waals model 31 . It follows from Eq . 1 that the experimentally determined stability limit can be fitted with the expression , with a i being parameters that are optimized to yield the best fit with the experimental data . These three fit parameters , a 1 to a 3 , are directly related to three molecular properties of the protein : C 0 , b , and α ( Supplementary equation 11 ) . Furthermore , these molecular properties can be correlated with a set of three measurable physical properties : the protein’s membrane curvature coupling strength : κ C 0 , the maximal tension that allows the curvature instability : σ * , and the protein density required for tubulating a tensionless membrane : ρ 0 ( Supplementary equation 12 ) . As shown in Figure 3 , the model is in good agreement with the measured relation between transition - density and membrane tension . In order to be able to obtain the spontaneous curvature from the value of the curvature coupling strength κ C 0 , we measured the bending rigidity of the membrane used here ( DOPS / DOPE / DOPC = 45 / 30 / 25 ) as κ = 23±3 k B T ( Mean ±SD , repeated for five GUVs , also see Methods and Supplementary Figure 6 ) . Assuming β = 50nm 2 19 , the fit results correspond to a spontaneous curvature C 0−1 = 5 . 1±0 . 7nm ( here and where not further specified below , uncertainties result from the standard error of fit parameters and error propagation ) agreeing well with values inferred from N - BAR protein curvature sorting experiments performed on a GUV - tether system 19 , 31 . The upper tension Shi and Baumgart Page 4 Nat Commun . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2015 July 08 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t limit for enabling membrane shape transitions through endophilin N - BAR for the lipid composition used here is σ * = 0 . 19±0 . 04 mN·m −1 . Finally , the protein transition - density required for tubulating a tensionless membrane is ρ 0 = 650±150µm −2 , corresponding to about 7 . 5 protein dimers on a CCV - sized membrane ( assuming a CCV radius of 30 nm ) . Interestingly , the number of endophilin molecules in synaptic boutons was measured in a recent study 32 . An endophilin dimer density of 546±36µm −2 on the synaptosome surface can then be estimated ( see Supplementary theory for details ) . This endophilin density turns out to be within the stable regime of the stability diagram ( for any membrane tension ) , but is localized close to the stability boundary ( assuming typical neuronal membrane tensions of 0 . 003 mN·m −1 to 0 . 04 mN·m −1 5 ) . This suggests that under physiological conditions , the plasma membrane of neuronal cells can easily switch between stable ( endocytosis suppressed ) and unstable ( endocytosis activated ) states by changing membrane tension or locally concentrating proteins such as endophilin . We reiterate in passing that our shape stability theory describes the capacity of a peripheral protein to generate curvature not only with the well - known spontaneous curvature , but with two additional parameters related to molecular details of the protein / membrane system : the protein density for tubulating a tensionless membrane , and the maximal tubulation tension . In future contributions we will demonstrate that these parameters can vary significantly , comparing different types of proteins . Shape stability boundary is unaffected by binding kinetics We note that the biophysical shape stability fitted to our experimental data is valid only under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions – an assumption that needs verification . We therefore investigated if binding kinetics of proteins to the membrane measurably affects the transition - density . Negatively charged PS lipids can affect the binding kinetics of proteins both in vivo and in vitro 18 , 33 . Specifically , a larger fraction of PS lipids in the membrane is known to increase the membrane binding rate of the endophilin N - BAR domain 18 . In order to test the thermodynamic equilibrium hypothesis , we measured the membrane shape transition points for vesicles containing different amounts of negatively charged lipids . Not surprisingly , the equilibrium density of proteins on the membrane significantly increases with an increasing amount of PS lipids in GUVs ( Fig . 5 ) . Interestingly however , transition - densities , as well as the tension dependence , are identical within uncertainties for the three lipid compositions tested ( Fig . 5 and Supplementary Figure 7 ) . Equivalently , for the same lipid composition , only equilibrium densities , but not transition - densities , depend on bulk protein concentration ( Supplementary Figure 5a ) . To further validate the hypothesis that membrane binding kinetics do not affect our results , we measured an apparent protein binding rate by determining the slope of the protein binding curve in a time interval close to the shape instability ( Supplementary Figure 8a ) . Using GUVs under the same membrane tension ( 0 . 110±0 . 007 mN·m −1 , Mean±SD ) , we found that transition - densities exhibit no dependence on the apparent protein binding rate ( see Supplementary Figure 8b , showing a zero slope within statistical error ( 7 . 5±10s ) ) . We therefore conclude that under our Shi and Baumgart Page 5 Nat Commun . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2015 July 08 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t conditions , protein - membrane binding kinetics plays a negligible role in controlling the membrane curvature instability . Lipid shape as an additional control parameter We finally asked if lipid shape can affect the shape transition - density for endophilin N - BAR . Figure 6 shows that the cone - shaped lipids cholesterol and DOPE both significantly reduce the transition - density at constant membrane tension . This amplification effect of cone - shaped lipids on membrane tubulation is consistent with previous observations in a different experimental system 26 . However , only the presence of DOPE but not cholesterol lowers the bending rigidity of the membrane ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) . Therefore , at least for cholesterol , we can attribute its effect on the transition - density to the conical lipid shape 34 , 35 . It is well known that proteins with membrane curvature insertion ability will lead to different spontaneous curvature of the membrane depending on the protein’s insertion depth 36 . Therefore , in the presence of conical lipids , the protein’s coupling strength to membrane curvature may be altered by allowing the protein to insert more deeply into the lipid bilayer – a hypothesis that remains to be tested . In addition to membrane tension and protein density , lipid shape provides a third level of control that cells can use to regulate membrane shape transitions ( Fig . 7 ) . Discussion It has to be emphasized that we have used the simplest thermodynamic theory of membrane stability in the presence of curvature - inducing proteins , which neglects the highly anisotropic spontaneous curvature and significant oligomerization tendency of N - BAR domain proteins 18 , 37 – 40 . Nevertheless , our model accurately describes the shape transition . Precisely because the model does not assume details about the protein other than the curvature - coupling strength and an excluded area for the protein , it likely applies to all endocytic proteins . The presence of a well - defined membrane shape transition - density provides an attractive explanation for how endocytic protein recruitment can control plasma membrane deformation during CME : the initiation of membrane buds and the formation of a CCV may proceed only after establishing well defined transition - densities of endocytic proteins . For UFE , however , the endocytic vesicle formation route of a 10 millisecond duration leaves little time for a plasma membrane patch to undergo a sequential protein recruitment process as in CME ( typically 10 ~ 20s 2 ) . Thus , instead of recruiting additional curvature generating proteins to the membrane , for the case of UFE , a more plausible signal that triggers membrane budding is the lowering of membrane tension in the presence of already membrane - bound peripheral proteins . Due to the membrane fluidity , tension changes propagate at a speed of about 10 6 µm·s −1 11 , 41 . Therefore , a tension reduction caused by processes such as the fusion of exocytic vesicles into the plasma membrane can likely trigger endocytosis at a much faster rate compared to the process of recruiting peripheral curvature - inducing proteins . For classical endocytosis , a checkpoint that separates abortive from propagating endocytic pits has been identified 42 , 43 . It is possible that the stability boundary identified in our shape diagram provides a mechanistic explanation for this Shi and Baumgart Page 6 Nat Commun .

Abortive endocytic pits might assemble due to local fluctuations in protein density and membrane tension , but in situations where the stability boundary is not passed such fluctuations will eventually decay without producing vesicles . Our findings provide new insights into how cellular membrane shapes and dynamics are controlled by interacting with curvature - coupling proteins as well as via the regulation of membrane physical properties such as tension and lipid shape . We suggest that the coupling of membrane tension and density of curvature - coupling proteins determined here plays modulatory roles in all forms of endocytosis .

Casein , Tris , HEPES , and EDTA were obtained from Fisher Scientific ( Rochester , NY ) . All commercial reagents were used without further purification . Streptavidin conjugated microspheres with mean diameter of ~ 6µm were from Polysciences , Inc . ( Warrington , PA ) . An additional 0 . 5 % DSPE - Bio - 574 PEG2000 was added into the lipid mixture when preparing GUVs for membrane bending rigidity measurements through tether pulling . Rat endophilin A1 N - BAR _ C241 ( residues 1 – 247 ) and full - length endophilin A1 were expressed , purified and labelled with AF - 488 as described 18 , 23 . Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford analysis using bovine serum albumin ( Thermo ) as a standard . Concentrations indicated refer to total concentration of endophilin in terms of dimeric units . Imaging chamber preparation and GUV transfer procedures GUVs were prepared in 300mM sucrose solution by the standard method of electroformation with 0 . 3 % Texas Red - DHPE in desired lipid compositions , using indium tin oxide covered glass slides onto which thin films of lipids were prepared from chloroform solutions 44 . Two imaging chambers , GUV chamber and protein chamber , were formed between two coverslips ( 20mm×40mm , pre - treated with 2µL of 2 . 5mg·ml −1 casein , 20mM Tris , and 2mM EDTA ) overhanging a glass microscope slide ( 2mm thick ) . The GUV chamber has a total volume of 375µL and is made by diluting 5 ~ 8µL of the GUV stock solutions into a buffer containing glucose , sucrose , NaCl and HEPES . The osmolarity of the buffer was selected to be 20 % higher than the GUV stock solution ( measured with a micro - osmometer Advanced Instruments Inc . ( Norwood , MA ) ) to ensure that the vesicles had enough excess area for micropipette aspiration . The protein chamber had a total volume of 187 . 5µL . The protein stock solution was diluted to designated concentrations , using the Shi and Baumgart Page 7 Nat Commun . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2015 July 08 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t same buffer as used for diluting GUVs . For both chambers , we chose pH = 7 and NaCl was kept at 50mM , with 7mM HEPES . Sucrose and glucose ( 1 : 1 ) concentrations were adjusted to yield total osmolarities of the desired values . Micropipettes and transfer capillaries were prepared and casein - treated through incubation with saturated casein solutions followed by rinsing 18 , 44 . Occasionally , GUV membranes were observed to stick to pipette walls . Data from such vesicles were discarded . The GUV transfer was a four - step process as shown in Figure 1b : ① A GUV was aspirated into a micropipette to adjust the desired membrane tension . ② The transfer capillary was manually positioned to cover the GUV . ③ The GUV was transferred from the GUV chamber into the protein chamber using a motor - controlled micromanipulator ( Luigs and Neumann , Ratingen , Germany ) . ④ The transfer capillary was removed to expose the GUV to protein . The moment when the GUV was not protected anymore by the transfer capillary was defined as time zero in the protein - GUV association analysis . Zero aspiration pressure was checked before and after the protein - GUV association process to ensure absence of pressure drifts 45 . All the transfer and imaging processes were carried out at room temperature ( 23 . 7±0 . 3 ° ; Mean±SD measured on different days ) . Microscopy and data analysis The protein - membrane association process and the membrane geometry changes were monitored with a confocal fluorescence microscope 44 , using a 60× 1 . 1 N . A . objective ( Olympus , Center Valley , PA ) . The aspiration length , L p , micropipette radius , R p and GUV radius , R v were measured with Image J , as illustrated in Figure 1a . The GUV geometry was calculated as Area ( t ) = 4 π R v ( t ) 2 + 2 π R p L p ( t ) , Volume ( t ) = 4 π R v ( t ) 3 / 3 + π R p 2 L p ( t ) . The average protein fluorescence intensity was determined by fitting a Gaussian ring to the GUV contour ( excluding the aspirated region ) using MATLAB . R v can also be obtained from the fitting and was checked with the direct measurement in Image J . The measured fluorescence intensity was then converted to protein number density ρ ( t ) on the membrane , using the method of Ref . 19 , as follows . GUVs containing x % BODIPY and ( 100 - x ) % DOPC were prepared ( x : 0 . 1 ~ 0 . 7 ) and at least ten independent GUVs were imaged under the same settings as during the recording of GUV - protein association . A linear fit ( r 2 = 0 . 99 ) was carried out to get the relation between measured GUV fluorescence intensity and BODIPY density on the membrane . The quantum yield difference between BODIPY and AF - 488 was determined to be BODIPY / ‘AF - 488’ = 0 . 5 , by imaging bulk solution intensity of SUVs ( containing BODIPY ) and AF - 488 labelled proteins under the same solution conditions as in our experiments ( 50mM NaCl , pH 7 ) 46 . The average lipid headgroup area was assumed as 0 . 7 nm 2 . The relation between imaged average fluorescence intensity ( FL , in arbitrary units for 16 - bit images ) and dimeric endophilin N - BAR density ( ρ in the unit of µm −2 and with a labelling efficiency LE ) on GUVs is : FL / LE = ( 4 . 9±0 . 2 ) × ρ . The membrane shape transition point t c was defined as the time point when Area ( t ) begins to decrease ( Fig . 2 ) , and the corresponding protein density ρ ( t c ) was defined as the transition - density .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Membrane bending rigidity measurements A 1mm thick sample chamber was formed by overhanging two coverslips on both sides of a microscope glass slide . The bottom of the chamber was pre - treated with 2µL of 2 . 5mg·ml −1 casein in 20mM Tris - HCl and 2mM EDTA to prevent adhesion of beads and GUVs to the coverslip . The chamber was filled with 1µL of microsphere dispersion , 5µL of GUV dispersion , and 90 ~ 100µL of the same sucrose , glucose , NaCl and HEPES mixture as described above , resulting a final environment containing 50mM NaCl . The chamber was mounted on an inverted microscope ( 1×71 ; Olympus , Center Valley , PA ) equipped with a home built optical trap as described in refs 45 , 46 . A GUV ( about 10µm in radius ) was aspirated at a constant pressure and subsequently brought into contact with a trapped bead . Then the bead was moved at 10µm·s −1 to pull out a membrane tether of 20µm in length . The tether pulling force f is determined as for a Hookean spring : f = k Δ x , where k is the trap stiffness and Δ x is the displacement of the bead relative to its equilibrium position . The stiffness of the trap with a typical value of 0 . 05pN·nm −1 was calibrated by the drag - force method 47 for multiple beads . Aspiration pressure was changed after the formation of a stable tether to obtain the relation between tether pulling force and membrane lateral tension . Each lateral tension was maintained until the pulling forces reached equilibrium ( typically a few seconds ) . Membrane bending rigidity was subsequently extracted from the relation : 48 . For each lipid composition used , force - tension relations and thus bending rigidities were measured on tethers pulled from at least five independent GUVs .

Membrane tension and bound protein density modulate membrane shape transition ( a ) A representative trial with high ( 0 . 206 mN·m −1 ) membrane tension , the membrane - bound endophilin N - BAR density at the onset of area decrease ( as indicated by the arrow ) genuinely reveals the shape transition point . The area is calculated from the time - dependent aspiration length and vesicle radius as shown in Supplementary Figure 2b . ( b ) A representative trial with low ( 0 . 029 mN·m −1 ) membrane tension . Transition - density ( marked by the dashed lines ) decreased significantly compared to the high tension case shown in ( a ) . Bulk concentrations of endophilin N - BAR are 150nM in ( a ) and 75nM in ( b ) . Potential influence of bulk protein concentration on transition - densities was eliminated by comparing the transition - densities of similar tension GUVs in endophilin N - BAR solutions of various bulk concentrations ( Supplementary Figure 5a ) . Additionally , there was no observable influence of membrane tension on the endophilin N - BAR’s equilibrium density on GUVs ( Supplementary Figure 5b ) . Shi and Baumgart Page 14 Nat Commun .

Three ways of mediating membrane curvature instability Three regulatory elements are identified in this contribution that can modulate membrane shape transitions induced by the binding of curvature coupling proteins . Notably , membrane budding and tubulation is not solely induced by protein association ( left arrow ) . The effects of lowering membrane tension ( middle arrow ) and changing membrane lipid composition ( right arrow ) also control membrane shape transition without the assistance of additional proteins . The contribution of peripheral proteins is defined by their density on the membrane , emphasizing a thermodynamic role played by protein molecules in mediating membrane shape transitions . The tension effect may explain an ultrafast pathway cells can utilize to control membrane shape transformations such as endocytosis . Shi and Baumgart Page 19 Nat Commun .
