Introduction Dynamin was first identified as a microtubule - binding protein ( Shpetner and Vallee , 1989 , 1992 ; Scaife and Margolis , 1990 ; Maeda et al . , 1992 ) . However , the importance of its association with microtubules was questioned after the establishment of a function for dynamin in endocytosis . Dynamin is a homologue of the Drosophila melanogaster shibire gene ( Chen et al . , 1991 ) , mutations in dynamin block endocytosis , and dynamin’s GTPase activity is crucial for the fission of endocytic pits . Polymerized dynamin rings have been proposed to function as a pinchase ( Urrutia et al . , 1997 ) or poppase ( Stowell et al . , 1999 ) or by a molecular switch mechanism requiring subsequent activation of a downstream substrate ( Sever et al . , 2000 ) . Three dynamin isoforms have been identified in mam - mals . Dynamin 1 ( dyn1 ) and dyn3 are tissue specific ( neurons and brain for dyn1 ; testis , lung , and heart for dyn3 ) , whereas dyn2 is ubiquitously expressed . Dynamin has five characteristic domains : a GTPase domain in its N terminus , a middle domain that binds to  - tubulin ; a pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain that binds to phosphinositide - 4 , 5 - diphosphate and leads to mem - brane localization , a GTPase effector domain , and a pro - rich domain in the C terminus . The pro - rich domain binds to various SH3 domain – containing proteins and microtubules ( Herskovits et al . , 1993b ) . Recently , dyn2 mutations were found to be associated with Charcot - Marie - Tooth ( CMT ) neuropathies ( Zuchner et al . , 2005 ) , but the molecular and cellular mechanisms of dyn2’s involvement in disease pathogenesis are still unclear . The CMT hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies fall into two main groups . CMT type 1 includes demyelinating forms of the disease in which nerve conduction velocities ( NCVs ) are reduced ; CMT type 2 includes the axonal forms in which NCVs are normal , but conduction amplitudes are decreased ( Suter and Scherer , 2003 ) . There are also dominant intermedi - ate ( DI ) subtypes of CMT , denoted DI - CMTA , DI - CMTB , and DI - CMTC , that are characterized by both axonal and demyelinat - ing NCVs ( Kennerson et al . , 2001 ; Verhoeven et al . , 2001 ; D ynamin is a fission protein that participates in endocytic vesicle formation . Although dynamin was originally identified as a microtubule - binding protein , the physiological relevance of this function was unclear . Recently , mutations in the ubiquitously ex - pressed dynamin 2 ( dyn2 ) protein were found in patients with Charcot - Marie - Tooth ( CMT ) disease , which is an inherited peripheral neuropathy . In this study , we show that one of these mutations , 551  3 , induces prominent decoration of microtubules with the mutant dyn2 . Dyn2 was required for proper dynamic instability of micro - tubules , and this was impaired in cells expressing the 551  3 mutant , which showed a remarkable increase in microtubule acetylation , a marker of stable microtubules . Depletion of endogenous dyn2 with a small interfering RNA also resulted in the accumulation of stable micro - tubules . Furthermore , the formation of mature Golgi complexes , which depends on microtubule - dependent membrane transport , was impaired in both dyn2 knock - down cells and cells expressing the 551  3 mutant . Col - lectively , our results suggest that dyn2 regulates dynamic instability of microtubules , which is essential for organ - elle motility , and that this function may be impaired in CMT disease . Dynamic instability of microtubules requires dynamin 2 and is impaired in a Charcot - Marie - Tooth mutant Kenji Tanabe and Kohji Takei Department of Neuroscience , Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine , Dentistry , and Pharmaceutical Sciences , Okayama 700 - 8558 , Japan © 2009 Tanabe and Takei This article is distributed under the terms of an Attribution – Noncommercial – Share Alike – No Mirror Sites license for the first six months after the publica - tion date ( see http : / / www . jcb . org / misc / terms . shtml ) .

Results and discussion We assessed whether expression of the CMT - associated 551  3 and K558E dyn2 mutants inhibits endocytosis by transfecting COS - 7 cells with dyn2 cDNAs and examining uptake of Alexa Fluor 488 – transferrin . As a positive control , the cells were transfected with K44A , a GTPase - negative dyn2 mutant which is known to inhibit endocytosis ( Herskovits et al . , 1993a ; Jordanova et al . , 2003 ) . DI - CMTB patients have mutations within the dyn2 PH domain , including the deletion mutant 551  3 and the point mutant K558E ( Zuchner et al . , 2005 ) . This suggests that the impairment in CMT may be caused by an inability to form active dynamin polymers , which are needed to bind and then deform membranes to carry out peripheral cell functions ( McNiven , 2005 ) . In this study , we investigated the effect of the 551  3 mutation on dyn2 function and found that it induces the accumulation of stable micro - tubules , as does the reduction of endogenous dyn2 , indicating that dyn2 regulates the dynamic instability of microtubules Figure 1 .

Moreover , dynamin was originally identi - fied as a microtubule - associated protein ( Shpetner and Vallee , 1989 ) . Both dyn1 and dyn2 polymerize around microtubules , and these interactions lead to the stimulation of dynamin GTPase activity ( Maeda et al . , 1992 ; Warnock et al . , 1997 ) . To test whether dyn2 localizes along microtubules , we transfected COS - 7 cells with wild - type or 551  3 dyn2 cDNA constructs tagged with the V5 epitope . Microtubules were visu - alized by immunostaining for  - tubulin . Immunostaining with antibodies to V5 indicated that wild - type dyn2 was present in a punctate pattern on the plasma membrane as well as in sub - stantial amounts in the cytosol , where the puncta seemed to co - localize with the microtubules ( Fig . 2 , A – C ) . 551  3 dyn2 also colocalized with and prominently decorated microtubules van der Bliek et al . , 1993 ) . Although expression of either the K558E or K44A mutant completely blocked endocytosis ( Fig . 1 , A and B ; Zuchner et al . , 2005 ) , expression of 551  3 did not ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) . However , the transferrin - containing compart - ments in the 551  3 - transfected cells no longer accumulated at the perinuclear region ( Fig . 1 C ) but were instead transported to early and recycling endosomes ( Fig . S1 ) . Internalized transferrin - containing endosomes are transported along microtubules by dynein – dynactin complexes to perinuclear recycling endosomes ( Burkhardt et al . , 1997 ) . Therefore , it is likely that processes involved in capturing endosomes or traveling along micro - tubules are impaired in 551  3 - expressing cells . Supporting this microtubule - related role for dyn2 , it has previously been shown that 551  3 expression induces microtubule reorganization Figure 2 . Dyn2 remains associated with microtubules after the extraction of soluble proteins . ( A – L ) COS - 7 cells were transfected with the indicated con - structs and incubated with antibodies specific for V5 ( A , D , G , and J ) or  - tubulin ( B , E , H , and K ) , and the V5 and  - tubulin images were merged ( C , F , I , and L ) . To extract the cytosolic proteins , the cells were incubated with Triton X - 100 ( TX100 ) before fixation and processed for immunofluorescence ( D – F and J – L ) .

Therefore , we tested whether the dyn2 mutants could have the same effect . Acetylation distinguishes stable microtubules from dynamic microtubules ( Piperno et al . , 1987 ; Westermann and Weber , 2003 ) , although tubulin acetylation itself does not pro - mote microtubule stability ( Palazzo et al . , 2003 ) . Accordingly , we assessed the effect of 551  3 expression in COS - 7 cells on microtubule acetylation . Expression of wild - type , K44A , or ( Fig . 2 , G – I ) , as previously reported ( Zuchner et al . , 2005 ) . To more clearly demonstrate the association of dyn2 with micro - tubules , we performed immunolocalization after cytosolic pro - teins were extracted from cells with Triton X - 100 . Both wild - type dyn2 ( Fig . 2 , D – F ) and 551  3 ( Fig . 2 , J – L ) clearly colocalized with the microtubules in these conditions ( Zuchner et al . , 2005 ) . These results indicate that a subpopulation of dyn2 molecules localizes to microtubules in vivo and that the 551  3 mutation may alter the microtubule - binding properties of dyn2 . Figure 3 .

This indicates that dyn2 depletion does not affect the microtubule polymerization or de - polymerization mechanisms but rather increases the duration of microtubule pause . This implies that wild - type dyn2 increases the frequency of microtubule growth and / or shrinkage . Next , we investigated how the effect of dyn2 on micro - tubules contributes to cellular activities . Because impaired dynamic instability of microtubules is suggested to inhibit traf - ficking along microtubules ( Mimori - Kiyosue and Tsukita , 2003 ; Vaughan , 2005 ) and Golgi apparatus formation is dependent on microtubule - mediated transport ( Thyberg and Moskalewski , 1999 ) , we examined Golgi formation in dyn2 siRNA cells and 551  3 - expressing cells . External tracers could not be used to directly monitor microtubule - dependent transport in these experiments because they cannot be internalized by the dyn2 siRNA cells ( Thyberg and Moskalewski , 1999 ) . As expected , the Golgi complex was dispersed in  90 % of dyn2 siRNA cells ( Fig . 5 A , left ) . The fragments of the Golgi complex maintained characteristic cisternal stack morphologies , as judged with double - immunofluorescence staining using cis / medial ( GRASP65 ) - and trans ( p230 ) - Golgi markers ( Fig . 5 A , right ) and with electron microscopy ( Fig . 5 B ) . To rule out the possibility that the Golgi fragmentation in dyn2 siRNA cells is an indirect effect of endocytotic blockade , we analyzed Golgi formation in the 551  3 - expressing cells , in which dyn - dependent endocytosis is not blocked ( Fig . 1 ) . As controls , we also examined Golgi formation in K44A - and K558E - expressing cells , in which endocytosis is blocked ( Fig . 1 ) . Unlike expression of either K44A or K558E , 551  3 expression induced Golgi fragmentation ( Fig . S3 ) . Thus , the Golgi frag - mentation in dyn2 siRNA cells is not caused by the inhibition of dynamin - dependent endocytosis but is more likely the result of impaired organelle transport , which is dependent on normal microtubule dynamic instability . The regulation of microtubule stability by dyn2 seems to be independent of its GTPase activity because the K44A mutant had no effect on microtubule - dependent organelle transport ( Fig . S3 B ) . Similarly , the role of dyn2 in centrosome cohesion does not require its GTP domain ( Thompson et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore , it is possible that dyn2 can function as a structural protein independently of its GTPase activity . How is microtubule - dependent transport impaired by dyn2 depletion or expression of the 551  3 mutation ? One possi - bility is that minus end – oriented motor proteins are inhibited in these cells . Supporting this , inhibition of these motor proteins has been observed when dynamitin , a subunit of the dynein – dynactin complex , is overexpressed ( Burkhardt et al . , 1997 ) . Alternatively , dyn2 depletion and 551  3 expression may impair the capture of pre - Golgi intermediates onto microtubules . To examine these two possibilities , we analyzed the movement of the fragmented Golgi in dyn2 - depleted HeLa cells . For this pur - pose , HeLa cells expressing N - acetylglucosaminyltransferase I ( NAGT ) – GFP , a Golgi marker , were transfected with different dyn2 siRNA constructs , and Golgi fragmentation was induced by nocodazole treatment . The nocodazole was then washed out to allow microtubule polymerization , and the movement of the frag - mented Golgi during the recovery phase was observed by live cell imaging . In control cells , the fragmented Golgi eventually moved K558E dyn2 did not alter the degree of microtubule acetylation ( Fig . 3 A and not depicted ) . In contrast , 551  3 expression re - sulted in a massive accumulation of acetylated tubulin ( Fig . 3 A ) . Quantitative image analysis revealed a significant increase of acetylated tubulin in 551  3 - expressing cells ( the fluorescence intensity ratios of acetylated tubulin to dynamin - V5 were 3 . 9 ± 1 . 8 and 2 . 4 ± 1 . 1 in 551  3 and wild - type cells , respectively ; n = 30 , P < 0 . 05 ) , with no significant difference in total tubulin expression between 551  3 and the wild type ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) . Thus , the differential microtubule - binding patterns observed in 551  3 - expressing cells are likely caused by the abnormal accu - mulation of acetylated microtubules . We then asked whether the 551  3 - induced accumulation of acetylated microtubules is caused by a loss of function or a gain of function of dyn2 . To this end , we examined the effect of siRNA - mediated depletion of endogenous dyn2 on microtubule stability in HeLa cells . Two different dyn2 - specific siRNAs suc - cessfully knocked down endogenous dyn2 in HeLa cells ( Fig . S2 ) , and transferrin internalization was inhibited ( not depicted ) , as reported previously ( Huang et al . , 2004 ) . Immunofluorescence of the dyn2 siRNA – treated ( dyn2 siRNA ) cells did not show any apparent reorganization of microtubules ( Fig . 4 A ) . How - ever , Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that these cells had an approximately twofold increase in acety - lated tubulin , although the total tubulin protein levels did not change ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . In addition , localization of EB1 to the plus end of dynamic / growing microtubules in control siRNA – treated cells ( Mimori - Kiyosue and Tsukita , 2003 ) was signifi - cantly reduced in dyn2 siRNA cells ( Fig . 4 A and Fig . S2 , D and E ) , whereas total EB1 protein levels were unchanged ( Fig . 4 B ) . In contrast , the minus ends of microtubules were not affected by the siRNA treatment , as judged by staining pericentrin ( Fig . 4 A ) or  - tubulin ( not depicted ) . These results indicate that depletion of endogenous dyn2 , like the 551  3 mutant , induces the accu - mulation of acetylated microtubules and reduces the proportion of dynamic / growing microtubules . Thus , the 551  3 - induced accumulation of stable microtubules is caused by a loss of micro - tubule - related dyn2 function . To further confirm the effect of dyn2 depletion on micro - tubule stability , we performed the following two experiments . First , we treated siRNA - transfected HeLa cells with nocodazole , which is an inhibitor of microtubule polymerization . As the half life of stable microtubules (  1 h ) is much longer than that of dynamic microtubules (  5 – 10 min ; Schulze et al . , 1987 ) , no - codazole is expected to be more effective on dynamic micro - tubules . Nocodazole treatment for up to 1 h resulted in the disappearance of microtubules in control cells , whereas micro - tubules persisted in dyn2 siRNA cells ( Fig . 4 , C and D ) . Next , we analyzed the effect of dyn2 siRNA on HeLa cells that stably express GFP - tubulin . In control cells , microtubules showed repeated growth and shrinkage , a behavior known as dynamic instability ( Mitchison and Kirschner , 1984 ) , whereas growth and shrinkage were less frequently observed in dyn2 siRNA cells ( Fig . 4 E and Video 1 ) . Thus , dyn2 depletion indeed induces stable microtubule accumulation . Analysis of various microtubule dynamic instability parameters in dyn2 siRNA cells revealed that neither the growth rate nor the shortening rate was significantly on A ugu s t 27 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m JCB • VOLUME 185 • NUMBER 6 • 2009 944 Figure 4 .

This is consistent with observations that sug - gest neuropathies , including CMT , are caused by defects in membrane transport steps such as endocytosis , axonal transport , or protein degradation ( Suter and Scherer , 2003 ) . Notably , all of the dyn2 mutations that are associated with CMT , including 551  3 and K558E , are located in the PH domain ( Zuchner et al . , 2005 ) . The predicted structures of these mutant PH domains in - dicate that 551  3 but not K558E impairs the proper formation of the  3 /  4 loops , which is required for dyn2 dimerization . This implies that the decoration of microtubules induced by 551  3 , not by dyn2 depletion , may be caused by the abnormal polymerization activity of 551  3 resulting from the loss of dyn2 dimerization . In other words , wild - type dyn2 may contribute to the correct bundling of microtubules through its polymerization activity . Interestingly , dynamin was identified previously as a microtubule - binding protein ( Shpetner and Vallee , 1989 ) that cross - links microtubules to form bundles in vitro ( Scaife and Margolis , 1990 ; Maeda et al . , 1992 ; Shpetner and Vallee , 1992 ) . Dynamin also increases its GTPase activity when it polymerizes around microtubules ( Warnock et al . , 1997 ) . However , the physio - logical significance of these observations was unclear . This study is the first indication that dyn2 plays a role in the regula - tion of dynamic instability of microtubules in vivo and that this function of dyn2 is essential for microtubule - dependent mem - brane transport . However , the fact that dyn2 localizes at the microtubule bundle in cytokinesis ( Thompson et al . , 2002 ) and at the centrosome ( Thompson et al . , 2004 ) implies it has even more diverse microtubule - related functions , the elucidation of which will also require further study . Materials and methods Reagents and antibodies All chemicals and reagents were of biochemical grade . Nocodazole was purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . The following primary antibodies were used : rabbit antibodies against V5 ( Millipore ) , pericentrin ( Covance ) , and GRASP65 ( a gift from N . Nakamura , Kanazawa University , Kanazawa , Japan ) ; mouse antibodies against GM130 , EB1 , and p230 ( BD ) ;  - tubulin ,  - actin , and acetylated tubulin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) ; and goat anti - dyn2 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) . The following secondary antibodies were used : Alexa Fluor 488 – conjugated anti – goat IgG and Rhodamine red - X – conjugated anti – mouse IgG ( Invitrogen ) ; Cy3 - conjugated anti – rat IgG ( KPL ) ; and HRP - conjugated anti – mouse IgG , anti – rabbit IgG , and anti – goat IgG ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Alexa Fluor 488 – conjugated human transferrin was also purchased from Invitrogen . DNA construction Wild - type and K44A mutant rat dyn2 cDNAs were a gift from M . McNiven ( Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN ) and were subcloned into pcDNA4 V5 / His ( Invitrogen ) . Mutations were introduced with QuikChange II XL ( Agilent Technologies ) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions , and se - quences were verified by DNA sequencing . NAGT - GFP was a gift from N . Nakamura , and GFP - Rab5 and - Rab11 were gifts from M . Fukuda ( Tohoku University , Sendai , Japan ) . DNA was purified for transfection experiments by using a Plasmid Maxi kit from QIAGEN . Cell culture and transfection COS - 7 and HeLa cells were maintained in DME supplemented with 10 % serum . Transfection was performed by using Effectene ( QIAGEN ) accord - ing to the manufacturer’s instructions . The cells were analyzed 48 h after transfection . The uptake of transferrin was performed by incubating the cells with 25 µg / ml Alexa Fluor 488 – conjugated transferrin for 30 min at 37°C , as described previously ( Tanabe et al . , 2005 ) . Detergent extraction experiments were performed by incubating the cells in Brinkley reassembly buffer ( BRB80 ; 80 mM Pipes / KOH , pH 6 . 8 , 4 % polyethylene glycol 8000 , toward the perinuclear region ( Fig . 5 C and Video 2 ) . However , in dyn2 siRNA cells , we did not observe perinuclear concentra - tion of the fragmented Golgi , even after 30 min . Furthermore , tracking analysis revealed that movement of the fragmented Golgi in control siRNA cells repeatedly stopped ( Fig . 5 C ) , which might reflect a search and capture behavior ( Vaughan , 2005 ) . However , in the dyn2 siRNA cells , such movement was rarely seen . Moreover , although the velocity of the fragmented Golgi in dyn2 siRNA cells was comparable with that of control cells ( Fig . 5 D ) , the total distance moved was reduced in the dyn2 siRNA cells ( Fig . 5 E ) . These results suggest that , although movement along microtubules was not altered by dyn2 deple - tion , microtubule - mediated capture was inhibited . Because pre - Golgi elements are captured by interacting with EB1 , which localizes on microtubule plus ends ( Vaughan , 2005 ) , the dyn2 depletion – mediated reduction of EB1 recruitment ( Fig . 4 A ) may be responsible for the fragmentation of the Golgi complex . In dyn2 siRNA cells , EB1 was no longer localized in a punctate manner at the plus ends of microtubules , whereas the protein level was not affected ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) , demonstrating that dyn2 knockdown caused dislocation of EB1 from microtubule plus ends to the cytosol . It is unlikely that dyn2 directly acts on EB1 because dyn2 is localized along the entire length of the microtubules rather than restricted to the plus ends . However , it is plausible that the mislocalization of EB1 in dyn2 siRNA cells is a consequence of altered microtubule stability . To date , dynamin has been found to function in vesicle fission in endocytosis ( Takei et al . , 1995 ) , in actin reorganiza - tion ( Schafer , 2004 ) , and in centrosome cohesion ( Thompson et al . , 2004 ) . This study reveals yet another function , namely in dynamic instability of microtubules . We showed that this func - tion of dyn2 is essential for microtubule - dependent membrane transport . It is unlikely that the accumulation of stable micro - tubules and the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus are caused by dysfunction of the centrosome ( Thompson et al . , 2004 ) be - cause we did not detect impairment of the centrosome in the dyn2 siRNA – transfected HeLa cells ( Fig . 4 A ) . Decreased microtubule instability might impair capture of pre - Golgi organ - elles , which is necessary for the formation of the mature Golgi . Alternatively , dynamin might be involved in the maintenance of cargo attachment to the microtubules . Further examination is required to distinguish between these possibilities . In this study , we demonstrated that different CMT mutants affect different membrane transport events . Thus , K558E affects endocytosis , whereas 551  3 impairs microtubule - dependent Table I .

Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy Cells were fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temper - ature or with 100 % methanol for 10 min at  20°C . After three washes with PBS , the cells were treated with 1 % BSA and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 30 min and then incubated with primary antibodies for 45 min at room tem - perature . After three washes with PBS , the cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with secondary antibodies . After another three washes with PBS , the cells were mounted in PermaFluor ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and analyzed by the spinning disc confocal microscope system ( CSU10 ; Yokogawa Electric Co . ) on an inverted microscope ( IX - 71 ; Olympus ) equipped with an Ar / Kr laser . Images were acquired using a UPlan - Apochromat 100× NA 1 . 35 oil immersion objective ( Olympus ) and an electron - multiplying charge - coupled device camera ( iXon ; Andor Technology ) . Image capture and acquisition were performed using MetaMorph software ( MDS Analyti - cal Technologies ) . All images were saved as TIFF files , and brightness and contrast were adjusted with ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health ) . For conventional electron microscopy , cells were fixed with 4 % paraformal - dehyde and 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 4 , for 10 min at room temperature . The series were observed by using a transmis - sion electron microscope ( H - 7100 ; Hitachi ) at the Central Research Labora - tory at the Okayama University Medical School . Live imaging and data analysis HeLa cells stably expressing GFP –  - tubulin were a gift from Y . Mimori - Kiyosue ( Knowledge Action Network Research Institute , Kobe , Japan ) . To visualize the Golgi complex , NAGT - GFP was introduced into HeLa cells by Effec - tene . The cells were transfected with siRNAs 24 h after DNA transfection and then observed 48 h later . To observe Golgi motility , the cells were in - cubated with 10 µM nocodazole for 2 h and then washed and incubated in DME + 10 % FBS . The cells were incubated in culture medium and kept at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 using a stage incubator ( MI - IBC ; Olympus ) and digi - tal gas mixer ( GM - 2000 ; Tokai Hit ) and imaged using the aforementioned confocal system . The quantification and analysis of fluorescent signals was performed by using MetaMorph software and ImageJ . Microtubule dynamic instability parameters were measured as described previously ( Shelden and Wadsworth , 1993 ; Mimori - Kiyosue et al . , 2005 ) . In brief , HeLa cells sta - bly expressing GFP –  - tubulin were imaged with a 2 - s interval 72 h after transfection with siRNAs . Life history plots of 17 microtubules in three con - trol cells and 20 microtubules in four dyn2 siRNA cells were analyzed . The duration of growth / pause / shrinking of microtubules was analyzed as de - scribed in Shelden and Wadsworth ( 1993 ) . Rates of growth / shrinking are instantaneous ( measured within one interval between successive frames ) . All data were analyzed for significance using a Student’s t test . Online supplemental material Fig . S1 shows localization of internalized transferrin under the expression of the 551  3 mutant . Fig . S2 shows the dyn2 siRNA effects on acetylated tubulin and EB1 localization . Fig . S3 shows Golgi fragmentation induced by the expression of 551  3 . Videos 1 and 2 show time - lapse experiments of HeLa cells stably expressing GFP –  - tubulin or NAGT - GFP , respectively , that were transfected with control or dyn2 siRNAs . We thank Dr .
