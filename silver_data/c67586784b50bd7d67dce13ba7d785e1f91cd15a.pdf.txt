Bamburg 1 1 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , Colorado State University , Fort Collins , Colorado and 2 Department of Neuroscience , University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , Minnesota , USA Abstract The regulation of ﬁlopodial dynamics by neurotrophins and other guidance cues plays an integral role in growth cone pathﬁnding . Filopodia are F - actin - based structures that explore the local environment , generate forces and play a role in growth cone translocation . Here , we review recent research showing that the actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / coﬁlin family of proteins mediates changes in the length and number of growth cone ﬁlopodia in response to brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) . Although inhibition of myosin contractility also causes ﬁlopodial elongation , the elongation in response to BDNF does not occur through a myosin - dependent pathway . Active ADF / coﬁlin increases the rate of cycling between the monomer and polymer pools and is critical for the BDNF - induced changes . Thus , we discuss potential mechanisms by which ADF / coﬁlin may affect ﬁlopodial initiation and length change via its effects on F - actin dynamics in light of past research on actin and myosin function in growth cones . Key words : actin - depolymerizing factor , coﬁlin , ﬁlopodia , growth cone . Introduction Neuronal growth cones rely on dynamic ﬁlopodia to explore their surroundings , as well as for force generation related to motility ( Heidemann et al . , 1990 ) . Filopodia are generally short ( 0 . 5 to several µm ) membranous protrusions containing a core of colinear , bundled F - actin ﬁlaments , but also contain myosin and components of focal contacts ( Bridgman & Dailey , 1989 ; Steketee & Tosney , 2002 ) . The F - actin in ﬁlopodial bundles is cross - linked with fascin ( Cohan et al . , 2001 ) and is very stable , having a half - life more than 10 - fold longer ( approximately 25 min ) than lamellipodial F - actin ( Mallavarapu & Mitchison , 1999 ) . Regulation of ﬁlopodia in neurons is important for both growth cone guidance and neurite branch formation , both of which determine the ultimate arborization and connectivity in the nervous system ( Goodman & Shatz , 1993 ; Gallo & Letourneau , 1999 ) . Contact with guidance cues directs both of these processes ; growth cone morphology and the behavior of its actin and microtubule cytoskeletal structures is modiﬁed downstream of guidance molecules ( Gallo et al . , 1997 ; Gallo & Letourneau , 2004 ; Zhou & Cohan , 2004 ) and axonal collateral branching ( following extensive ﬁlopodial sprouting ) can result from contact with beads coated with nerve growth factor ( NGF ; Gallo & Letourneau , 1998 ) . In addition , den - dritic ﬁlopodia are precursors to dendritic spines , post - synaptic structures whose diverse and dynamic morphology is thought to underlie learning and mem - ory ( Sala , 2002 ) . Neurotrophins have been implicated in modulating the formation and morphology of both dendritic ﬁlopodia and spines ( Shimada et al . , 1998 ; Matsutani & Yamamoto , 2004 ) . Furthermore , a point mutation that impairs secretion of the neurotrophin brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) is corre - lated with hippocampal functional impairment in humans and animals and plasticity impairment in hippocampal cell culture models ( Egan et al . , 2003 ; Hariri et al . , 2003 ) , providing a potential link between ﬁlopodial regulation and adult cognitive function . Growth cone ﬁlopodia explore their local environ - ment via extension , waving and retraction . When adhered at their tips , they can exert a pulling force ( Heidemann et al . , 1990 ; Smith , 1994 ; Suter et al . , 1998 ; Suter & Forscher , 2000 ) that can either move attached objects ( such as beads or other neurite shafts ) rearwards towards the growth cone or pull Correspondence : James R .

Fass et al . material from the growth cone central region antero - gradely , resulting in engorgement of the ﬁlopodium and advance of the growth cone along the path of the ﬁlopodium ( Goldberg & Burmeister , 1986 ; Smith , 1994 ; Letourneau , 1996 ) . Engorgement of a ﬁlopo - dium into a neurite is a proposed mechanism for interactions with guidepost cells during grasshopper pioneer axon extension ( Sabry et al . , 1991 ) and has been observed during interactions between Aplysia growth cones and restrained ( immobilized ) Aplysia cell adhesion molecule ( apCAM ) - coated beads ( Suter et al . , 1998 ) , as well as between chick sym - pathetic neuron growth cones and other cells or beads coated with polyornithine or laminin ( Smith , 1994 ) . This ﬁlopodial behavior seems analogous to the entire growth cone , in which there is an inverse relationship between retrograde ﬂow and growth cone advance ( Lin & Forscher , 1995 ) . This relation - ship has led to a model for forward motility whereby a cellular process will either be retracted at some time after protrusion or adhere to some stable substrate , allowing the same forces that would have caused retraction to result in forward movement of more proximal cellular components . Generation of pulling force is dependent upon motor proteins ( for a review , see Brown & Bridgman , 2004 ) , presumably isoforms of myosin attached to actin ﬁlaments with opposite orientations ( Wylie et al . , 1998 ; Bridgman et al . , 2001 ; Wylie & Chantler , 2001 ; Bridgman , 2002 ; Brown & Bridgman , 2003b ) . However , it is as yet unclear which speciﬁc isoforms of myosin are involved directly in ﬁlopodial retraction or , for that matter , engorgement . Nevertheless , ﬁlopodial behavior is not simply the result of motor - based rearrangement of static actin structures . F - actin throughout the growth cone is constantly turning over , via polymerization at the leading edge , retrograde ﬂow of F - actin and depo - lymerization within the transitional zone ( Forscher & Smith , 1988 ; Lin & Forscher , 1995 ; Welnhofer et al . , 1997 ; Schaefer et al . , 2002 ) . One of the major agents responsible for this turnover is the actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / coﬁlin ( AC ) family of proteins ( reviewed by Sarmiere & Bamburg , 2004 ) . The AC proteins bind preferentially to F - actin on which the associated ATP has been hydrolyzed to ADP ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ) and promote both severing of ﬁlaments ( Bamburg et al . , 1999 ; Ichetovkin et al . , 2000 , 2002 ) and depo - lymerization from the pointed end . Once in the mon - omer state , proﬁlin induces a rapid exchange of ATP for ADP on the G - actin and , because AC proteins preferentially bind ADP – actin monomers , they are free to recycle to F - actin to repeat their dynamizing effects ( Pollard et al . , 2000 ) . Proﬁlin - bound ATP – G - actin readily participates in barbed - end polymerization ; thus , rather than simply promoting depolymerization of F - actin , active AC proteins can participate in enhancing the rate of cycling , or turnover , between G - and F - actin in many systems ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Lappalainen & Drubin , 1997 ; Rosenblatt et al . , 1997 ; Theriot , 1997 ) , including within neuronal growth cones ( Meberg & Bamburg , 2000 ) . How might AC proteins be involved speciﬁcally in ﬁlopodial regulation ? Recently , Gehler et al . ( 2004a ) demonstrated that BDNF signals in retinal ganglion growth cones by inhibiting Rho GTPase . Working downstream of Rho , Gehler et al . have found that BDNF effects on ﬁlopodia are mediated through modulation of AC protein activity and , although myosin II - dependent alterations in ﬁlopodia length can occur in these growth cones , BDNF does not work through modulating myosin II activity ( Gehler et al . , 2004b ) . These experiments will be reviewed ﬁrst and we will then address their potential implications for how AC proteins may function in ﬁlopodial initiation , extension and retraction . AC regulation of ﬁlopodia Gehler et al . previously demonstrated that BDNF binding to the p75 neurotrophin receptor ( p75 NTR ) enhances ﬁlopodial length by decreasing the activity of RhoA ( Gehler et al . , 2004a ) . Their results showed that several neurotrophins ( BDNF , nerve growth factor ( NGF ) , and neurotrophin ( NT ) - 3 ) cause increases in ﬁlopodial length in chick retinal , dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) and ciliary growth cones ( Gehler et al . , 2004a ) . Furthermore , these length changes were mimicked and pre - empted by treatment with either of two p75 - speciﬁc antibodies : CHEX and AB1554 . Neurotrophin - induced ﬁlopodial length changes were not observed in growth cones of p75 – / – mouse retinal or DRG neurons , yet these growth cones had longer ﬁlopodia , similar to neurotrophin - treated p75 + / + growth cones , implicating unoccupied p75 NTR in downregu - lation of ﬁlopodial length . Finally , both p75 – / – and BDNF - treated neurons displayed reduced levels of RhoA activity . More recent experiments have dis - sected the signaling downstream of Rho , beginning with the rho - associated coiled - coil kinase ( ROCK ) , also called Rho kinase ( ROK ) or Rho - associated kinase ( Gehler et al . , 2004b ) . Rho - associated kinase is well characterized as an upregulator of myosin II - dependent contractility in non - muscle cells ( e . g . Hirose et al . , 1998 ) that acts through either direct activation of myosin light chain kinase or inhibition of the phosphatase that removes the phosphate from the light chain ( Amano et al . , 1996 ; Kimura et al . , 1996 ) . In addition , ROCK regu - lates AC activity via the activation of speciﬁc kinases , namely LIMK1 and 2 ( named for the proteins lin - 11 , islet - 1 and Mec - 3 , which contain similar LIM domains ) ADF / coﬁlin and ﬁlopodial dynamics 175 and testicular kinase ( TESK ) 1 and 2 , which phos - phorylate and inactivate AC proteins at serine 3 ( Arber et al . , 1998 ; Yang et al . , 1998 ; Toshima et al . , 2001a , 2001b ) . The dephosphorylation ( activation ) of AC is regulated both by general phosphatases ( Meberg et al . , 1998 ; Samstag & Nebl , 2003 ) and more speciﬁc phosphatases , such as those of the slingshot family , of which six isoforms have been identiﬁed in mammalian cells ( Niwa et al . , 2002 ; Endo et al . , 2003 ; Ohta et al . , 2003 ; Nagata - Ohashi et al . , 2004 ) . Although the mechanisms regulating the slingshot phosphatases are not all known , one of these isoforms , namely slingshot - 1L ( SSH - 1L ) , requires binding to F - actin for activity ( Ohta et al . , 2003 ; Nagata - Ohashi et al . , 2004 ) and is also phosphor - ylated and inactivated by p21 - activated kinase 4 ( PAK4 ; J . Soosairajah et al . , unpubl . obs . , 2004 ) and other as yet unidentiﬁed kinases . In addition , the dephosphorylation of AC is regulated by its binding to members of the 14 - 3 - 3 family of phosphoprotein - binding partners ( Gohla & Bokoch , 2002 ) . Both LIMK1 and slingshot also bind 14 - 3 - 3 family mem - bers and because the consequences of these interactions are not well understood , the effects of the Rho signaling pathway on AC activity may be quite complex . However , a summary of the known regula - tory pathways is given in Fig . 1 . Gehler et al . ( 2004b ) treated cultured retinal ganglion neurons with a number of inhibitors or loaded the neurons with puriﬁed proteins using the Chariot™ reagent ( ActiveMotif , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . Inhibitors included the ROCK inhibitors Y - 27632 , HA - 1077 and H - 1152 and blebbistatin , a small molecule inhibitor of myosin II ( Straight et al . , 2003 ) . Proteins loaded included the AC - binding scaffolding protein 14 - 3 - 3 ζ and several mutants of Xenopus AC ( XAC ) : a non - severing mutant XAC KK95 , 96QQ ( KKQQ ) , a non - phosphorylatable and , therefore , constitutively active XAC ( S3A ) ( XACA3 ) and a pseudophosphorylated and , therefore , less active XAC ( S3E ) ( XACE3 ) , which acts in a dominant negative manner in polarization of cultured ﬁbroblasts ( Dawe et al . , 2003 ) . The BDNF - induced increase in growth cone ﬁlopodial length ( Gehler et al . , 2004a , 2004b ) could be mimicked by ROCK inhibition or introduction of XACA3 and blocked by introduction of XACE3 or the non - severing XAC KKQQ mutants or 14 - 3 - 3 ζ . No further increases in ﬁlopodial length were observed when BDNF was used to treat cells pretreated with a ROCK inhibitor or preloaded with XACA3 . Immu - nostaining speciﬁc for inactive ( phosphorylated ) AC revealed similar reductions throughout the growth cone after BDNF or ROCK inhibitor treatment ; these reductions were blocked in cells loaded with 14 - 3 - 3 ζ , suggesting 14 - 3 - 3 ζ prevented the ﬁlopodial length increase through its ability to inhibit activation of endogenous AC . Finally , slingshot immunostaining was punctate throughout the growth cone and , in some cases , was observed along and at the tips of ﬁlopodia , although its involvement in BDNF signaling was not assessed directly . Gehler et al . also assessed ROCK and XAC effects on ﬁlopodial number in the same way , but the results were somewhat more ambiguous ( Gehler et al . , 2004b ) . Inhibition of ROCK and loading with XACA3 mostly recapitulated BDNF - induced increases in ﬁlopodial number , but further increases were observed when these treatments were combined with Figure 1 . Schematic representation of the regulatory interactions between several actin regulatory proteins and the actin polymerization / depolymerization cycle . p21 - activated kinase 4 ( PAK4 ) activates ( phosphorylates ) LIM kinase 1 ( LIMK1 ) and inactivates ( phos - phorylates ) slingshot - 1L ( SSH - 1L ) on a site other than the C - terminal tail domain ( J . Soosairajah et al . , unpubl . obs . , 2004 ) . Slingshot inactivates ( dephosphorylates ) LIMK1 and activates ( dephosphorylates ) actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / coﬁlin ( AC ) , resulting in a net increase in AC activity and actin ﬁlament turnover . The other players in this pathway are F - actin and 14 - 3 - 3 ζ . F - Actin is necessary for slingshot activity ; the interaction of SSH - 1L , which has been phosphorylated in its C - terminal tail domain by an unidentiﬁed kinase , and F - actin is inhibited by 14 - 3 - 3 γ and 14 - 3 - 3 ζ ( Nagata - Ohashi et al . , 2004 ; J . Soosairajah et al . , unpubl . obs . , 2004 ) . Stimulatory interactions ( arrows ) and inhibitory interactions ( blocked lines ) are shown . Active AC increases F - actin turnover rate by binding preferentially to ADP – actin subunits ( white ) as opposed to ADP·Pi - actin ( gray ) and ATP - actin subunits ( black ) . Bound AC increases F - actin severing and pointed end depolymerization . Free ADP – G - actin monomers can exchange their bound nucleotide ( enhanced by proﬁlin ) and engage in polymerization ( predominantly at the barbed end ) . 176 J . Fass et al . BDNF . Similarly , XACE3 loading did not completely block the effects of BDNF treatment on ﬁlopodial number , whereas loading of XAC KKQQ or 14 - 3 - 3 ζ did . These inconsistencies may be the result of unequal protein loading , partial activity of XACE3 or the presence of endogenous AC proteins . However , taken together , these results suggest that whereas BDNF controls ﬁlopodial length solely through AC regulation , the effects of BDNF on ﬁlopodial number are only partially AC dependent and may involve an AC - independent pathway . Given the downregulation of Rho and ROCK by BDNF , another pathway through which ﬁlopodial elongation and numbers could be affected is through modulation of myosin II activity . To investigate the role of myosin II , Gehler et al . ( 2004b ) used bleb - bistatin , an inhibitor of non - muscle myosin II , both alone and in concert with the various treatments already described . Treatment of growth cones with blebbistatin resulted in concentration - dependent increases in ﬁlopodial length and number but , over - all , the morphological responses differed from those seen following BDNF treatment . Time - lapse imaging revealed that 20 µ mol / L blebbistatin increased ﬁlopodial extension rates , while gradually reducing retraction rates . Paradoxically , blebbistatin also reduced the fraction of time ﬁlopodia spent extend - ing or retracting . In addition , blebbistatin treatment caused lamellipodial retraction , as well as ﬁlopodial detachment , bending and buckling . In contrast , BDNF treatment did not result in lamellipodial retrac - tion and ﬁlopodia remained substrate bound . Treat - ment with BDNF resulted in enhanced ﬁlopodial extension rates , and no change in either retraction rates or in the fraction of time ﬁlopodia spent extend - ing or retracting . Further evidence that the effects of BDNF on ﬁlopodial length are not mediated via myosin II came from experiments combining blebbistatin treatment with BDNF , ROCK inhibitors and XAC mutants ( Gehler et al . , 2004b ) . Blebbistatin ( 20 µmol / L ) caused additive increases in ﬁlopodial length when used in concert with BDNF , ROCK inhibitor or XACA3 loading , whereas XACE3 loading did not block blebbistatin - induced increases in ﬁlopodial length . Blebbistatin did not cause changes in ﬁlopodial number at concentrations lower than 50 µmol / L , at which additivity with other treatments was assessed . Thus , results from Gehler et al . ( 2004b ) suggest that BDNF acts to regulate growth cone ﬁlopodia independently of myosin II contractility . One major question arising from the results described above is : what direct effect is increased AC activity having on growth cone F - actin ? Recent work by Condeelis and colleagues has shown that activated coﬁlin and Arp2 / 3 act in concert to increase the number of free barbed ends , thus allow - ing a burst of actin polymerization that drives lamel - lipodial protrusion and can thereby determine the direction of lamellipodia - driven migration ( Ichetovkin et al . , 2002 ; DesMarais et al . , 2004 ; Ghosh et al . , 2004 ) . The ﬁnding of Gehler et al . ( 2004b ) that the non - severing KKQQ mutant blocked BDNF - induced changes as well as the XACE3 mutant suggests that severing is also important in ﬁlopodial length and number regulation and , on a qualitative basis , BDNF treatment was seen to induce an increase in lamel - lipodial area ( S . Gehler & P . Letourneau , unpubl . obs . , 2004 ) . However , it is not known whether BDNF induced bulk polymerization or depolymerization in the experiments of Gehler et al . ( 2004b ) . Whereas Gehler et al . ( 2004b ) applied BDNF in solution , it seems likely that growth cones would encounter more localized sources of neurotrophins during development . However , even in the case of homogeneous activation , Gehler et al . did not exam - ine whether AC proteins are differentially activated or targeted to different compartments of the growth cone or F - actin populations . Phosphorylated AC staining appears fairly homogeneous throughout the growth cone ( once thickness is accounted for ; see Fig . 2A ) and does not disappear preferentially from any particular region after exposure to BDNF . How - ever , simultaneous tracking of both total AC proteins and their activation state is required in order to ascertain whether localized activation of AC proteins is occurring in response to even homogeneous exposure to BDNF . In addition , there may be other mechanisms localizing the effects of AC in the growth cone , such as protection of some fraction of the F - actin population by tropomyosin ( DesMarais et al . , 2002 ) . Nevertheless , the work of Gehler et al . ( 2004b ) strongly suggests that BDNF regulates ﬁlopodial length solely through regulation of AC protein activation , whereas ﬁlopodial number may involve additional signaling pathways . However , it seems unlikely ( although not implausible ) that length and number of ﬁlopodia are regulated directly ( i . e . that there is a direct feedback pathway from some sensor of length or number to a mechanism for controlling length or number ) . Rather , we hypothesize that the number and length of ﬁlopodia present at any time depends on several mechanisms : initiation , extension and retraction . Thus , we ask which of the processes causing ﬁlopodia to arise or change in length may be affected by AC regulation . Initiation Data from melanoma cells suggest membrane - bound enabled / vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ( Ena / ADF / coﬁlin and ﬁlopodial dynamics 177 VASP ) family proteins accumulate in a speciﬁc area of the leading edge membrane , where they compete with capping proteins for barbed ends of actin ﬁlaments in the lamellar meshwork and , thus , allow localized elongation and consolidation ( through bundling of the elongating ﬁlaments ; e . g . by fascin ) of the affected ﬁlaments , a process called conver - gent elongation ( Svitkina et al . , 2003 ) . Svitkina et al . ( 2003 ) termed the initial structures resulting from this process ‘ Λ - precursors’ due to the arrowhead - shaped concentration of local actin ﬁlaments ( Fig . 3 ) . The Λ - precursors have not yet been observed in growth cones and growth cones differ from migrating cells in important aspects , such as the distribution of Arp2 / 3 , which is enriched in the peripheral rufﬂing lamella of ﬁbroblasts but , in growth cones , is enriched in the central domain ( Strasser et al . , 2004 ) . However , there is evidence to suggest that the convergent elongation model may extend to neurite growth cones , where Ena / VASP is located at the tips of ﬁlopodia and is essential for ﬁlopodial formation in response to Netrin - 1 ( Lebrand et al . , 2004 ) . Another proposed mechanism for growth cone ﬁlopodial initiation involves actin ﬁlament nucleation from growth cone structures called focal rings ( Steketee et al . , 2001 ) . These structures are found at the bases of ﬁlopodia and may be associated with deﬁning the site of the initial nub , which develops into a ﬁlopodium . Convergent elongation and focal ring - dependent ﬁlopodial initiation are not mutually exclusive mechanisms , because focal rings could precede the formation of localized Ena / VASP patches or form as a consequence . Regardless , there are no data concerning the dependence of either of these hypothesized mechanisms on the rate of actin turnover , which is increased in growth cones expressing XAC ( wt ) ( Meberg & Bamburg , 2000 ) and is presumably increased as a result of the AC activation following BDNF treatment and ROCK inhibition and decreased following loading with XACE3 or KKQQ mutants . In the case of the convergent elongation hypothesis , one may imagine that more rapid turnover may allow more frequent convergence of peripheral actin ﬁlaments to form Λ - precursor structures that either meet membrane - associated concentrations of initia - tion factors , such as Ena / VASP , or bring together barbed - end associated proteins that then further the initiation process . Extension Once nascent ﬁlopodia have grown beyond the Λ - precursor or bud stage , what determines their ultimate length or , rather , the length distribution of all the ﬁlopodia on a growth cone at a certain time point ? G - Actin adds to the tips of ﬁlopodia ( Okabe & Hirokawa , 1991 ) , where bundled F - actin ﬁlaments are thought to cause membrane protrusion by an elastic Brownian ratchet mechanism ( Mogilner & Oster , 2003 ; Upadhyaya & van Oudenaarden , 2004 ) . By observing photobleached or photoactivated marks Figure 2 . Brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) - induced reduction of phosphorlyated actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / coﬁlin ( pAC ) levels in retinal growth cones . Treatment with BDNF for up to 30 min resulted in a progressive reduction in the intensity of pAC staining ( A , C , E , G ) . Growth cones were counterstained with Alexa Fluor 568 - phalloidin ( B , D , F , H ) . 178 J . Fass et al . on ﬁlopodial actin bundles , Mallavarapu and Mitchison ( 1999 ) revealed two distinct , seemingly independent mechanisms of control over ﬁlopodial length versus time . They determined that both retraction rate ( indi - cated by retrograde motion of the ﬁduciary marks ) and elongation rate ( indicated by an increase in the relative distance between a ﬁduciary mark and the end of the ﬁlopodium ) governed changes in the posi - tion of the ﬁlopodium tip ( i . e . total ﬁlopodial length , assuming lack of lamellipodial advance or retraction ) . Their data also suggested that there was a stronger correlation between length change and elongation ( polymerization ) rate than between length changes and retraction rates . However , these studies were performed in untreated growth cones ; drug or growth factors could , potentially , shift dominance between these two processes . The BDNF - induced ﬁlopodial length increases reported by Gehler et al . ( 2004b ) could have been due to either a reduction in retraction rate or an increase in polymerization . One possibility is that increased AC activity may lead to an increased G - actin concentration , but this is not necessarily the case . However , DesMarais et al . ( 2004 ) found that by blocking either Arp2 / 3 or coﬁlin function they could prevent an increase in free barbed ends and concomitant lamellipodial protrusion in rat adenocar - cinoma cells . Conceivably , activation of coﬁlin ( and / or ADF ) leads to a greater prevalence of severing and then minus - end depolymerization , whereas acti - vation of both coﬁlin and Arp2 / 3 leads , more often , to severing and then protection of the free pointed ends , limiting minus - end depolymerization and preserving free barbed ends . The former would cause Figure 3 . Platinum replica electron microscopy ( top ) of the leading edge of a mouse melanoma B16F1 cell showing a ﬁlopodium ( arrow ) and a Λ - precursor ( arrowhead ) . Some ﬁlaments converging to the vertex of the Λ - precursor are highlighted in cyan . Fluorescence images of the same cell expressing a green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - fascin chimera ( green ) costained with rhodamine - phalloidin ( red ) are shown at the bottom .

Svitkina , University of Pennsylvania . ) ADF / coﬁlin and ﬁlopodial dynamics 179 an overall shift from F - actin to G - actin , whereas the latter would cause the reverse . Thus , the BDNF - mediated increase in AC activity alone may have led to increased turnover as well as somewhat elevated G - actin levels , which then increased the rate of polymerization at ﬁlopodial tips . Alternatively , AC activity could ‘chop up’ the actin meshwork surrounding the base of a ﬁlopodium . Presumably it is myosin - generated tension produced between this actin meshwork and the ﬁlaments of a ﬁlopodial actin bundle that results in retrograde motion of that ﬁlopodium ( Jay , 2000 ) and a highly severed actin meshwork with less structural integrity may serve as a poorer base for tension generation . Less tension leads to less retrograde ﬂow and , thus , with even a constant rate of polymerization at ﬁlopodial tips , ﬁlopodial length would increase . If this is the mechanism underlying increased ﬁlopodial length , it is evidently not entirely effective ; as shown in Fig . 2 , there is no marked decrease in F - actin density evident after BDNF treatment , during the same time that ﬁlopodial length is increasing . Thus , it is reasonable that inhibition of myosin II via blebbistatin would further decrease the rate of retrograde ‘reeling in’ of ﬁlopodia , further increasing length . Retraction As mentioned above , we must interpret the results of Gehler et al . ( 2004b ) on ﬁlopodial retraction and extension with caution ; these may be the result of a combination of changes in polymerization rate at the tip and retrograde ‘reeling in’ of the ﬁlopodial actin bundle with respect to the substrate ( and growth cone ) . However , although BDNF does signal through ROCK ( Gehler et al . , 2004b ) , which is known to affect myosin activity , there seems to be compensatory signaling to limit the effects of BDNF to AC proteins . We are led to this conclusion by the ﬁnding of Gehler et al . , ( 2004b ) that enhancing AC activity ( which should not affect myosin activation and , thus , retrograde F - actin ﬂow ) was sufﬁcient by itself to reproduce the ﬁlopodial changes caused by BDNF signaling . The balance of forces and relative motions of growth cone cytoskeletal structures during different behaviors is poorly understood . Certainly , tension generation within growth cones is important , because treatment with the broader - acting and less - speciﬁc myosin inhibitor 2 , 3 - butanedione monoxime ( BDM ) retards retrograde ﬂow and leads to increased outgrowth ( Lin et al . , 1996 ) . Retrograde ﬂow occurs in the actin meshwork of lamellipodia ( Forscher & Smith , 1988 ; Welnhofer et al . , 1997 ) and ﬁlopodia ( Mallavarapu & Mitchison , 1999 ) and must , ultimately , result from motor - based tension generation between surface adhesions and F - actin within the growth cone or neurite shaft . Filopodia can also form surface adhesions and it appears that these adhesions serve different functions ( including regulation of lamellipodial veil advance between adjacent ﬁlopo - dia ) according to their locations along a ﬁlopodium ( Steketee & Tosney , 2002 ) . The idea that ﬁlopodia speciﬁcally , and the growth cone in general , can either retrogradely pull in protrusions ( ﬁlopodia or lamellipodial ) or grab hold of substrate adhesions and generate tension leading to growth cone advance is known as the clutch hypothesis ( Mitchison & Kirschner , 1988 ; Jay , 2000 ) , but the locations and dynamics of ‘clutching’ ( i . e . the force distribution over time within growth cones ) are not well characterized . Many classes of non - muscle myosins are found in neuronal growth cones and their roles in neurite outgrowth and growth cone motility have been reviewed recently ( Brown & Bridgman , 2003a ; Brown & Bridgman , 2004 ) . Brieﬂy , although myosin II has been the best studied of they myosin classes , there is still controversy over the roles of its speciﬁc isoforms ( Brown & Bridgman , 2003a ) . Myosin IIb appears be responsible for retrograde ﬂow of F - actin in growth cone lamellipodia and myosin IIa may func - tion redundantly . In addition , myosin IIa may have a role in stabilizing nascent focal contacts ( Wylie & Chantler , 2001 ) . Myosin 1B ( MYO1B ) and D are present in neurons , but have not been well studied , whereas there is some controversial evidence that MYO1C ( and not myosin II ) is responsible for retro - grade ﬂow ( Diefenbach et al . , 2002 ) . Although some evidence initially suggested that myosin V resists ﬁlopodial retraction ( Wang et al . , 1996 ) , other studies have refuted this and , instead , implicated myosin Va in organelle transport ( Evans et al . , 1997 ) ; myosin Vb and c are not well studied in the nervous system . Myosin VI is also found in growth cones , but its physiol - ogical function has not been well studied . Blebbistatin , a small molecule inhibitor of myosin II ( Cheung et al . , 2002 ) that works by indirectly inter - fering with actin binding ( Kovacs et al . , 2004 ) , was recently assessed against non - muscle myosins and found to inhibit human non - muscle myosin II but not human myosins Ib , Va and X ( Straight et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , myosin VI cannot be ruled out as a possible mediator of blebbistatin - induced ﬁlopodial changes observed by Gehler et al . ( 2004b ) . The observation that blebbistatin increased ﬁlopodial length implies a reduction of retrograde ﬂow of ﬁlopodial F - actin bundles , by inhibition of myosin IIa or b . Meanwhile , Gehler et al . ( 2004b ) reported that ﬁlopodia detach - ment and ‘bending and buckling’ increased in response to blebbistatin treatment . Detachment may have been a result of loss of focal contact stabilization via myosin IIa inhibition , whereas the bending and 180 J . Fass et al . buckling behavior suggests continued activity of some myosin class within the ﬁlopodia ( perhaps myosin VI ) . Alternatively , this behavior may have sim - ply been an effect of random variation of myosin II inhibition . Differential regulation of AC proteins in turning behavior Could differential AC regulation across the growth cone be a mechanism of achieving directional guid - ance ? It has been observed previously that ﬁlopodial extension and retraction rates vary across growth cones ( Bray & Chapman , 1985 ; Mallavarapu & Mitchison , 1999 ) and that calcium signaling can result from contacts experienced by individual ﬁlopodia ( Gomez et al . , 2001 ) . The AC proteins can be regulated downstream of intracellular calcium ( Meberg , 2000 ) . In addition , individual ﬁlopodia can respond to contact with guidance cues ( Smith , 1994 ; Gallo & Letourneau , 2004 ) and ﬁlopodial sprouting has been shown to be necessary for turning in response to a guidance cue ( Zheng et al . , 1996 ) . This suggests a potential link between AC activity , ﬁlopodia and turning and , indeed , preliminary data suggest that AC activity is increased concomitantly with ﬁlopodial sprouting on the far side of a growth cone turning away from a negative guidance cue ( Fig . 4 ) . Alternatively , a recent study found that growth cone turning on a uniform substrate was signiﬁcantly correlated with lamellipodial size and not with ﬁlopo - dial length or number ( Wang et al . , 2003 ) . Further - more , preferential laser inactivation on one side of the growth cone of myosin Ic , but not myosin V , interfered with turning behavior . Although this study suggests a dominant role for both motor activation and lamellipodial area in growth cone turning , the turning was not a result of guidance cue signaling . Thus , it remains to be seen whether turning depends on asymmetric motor protein activation or lamellipodial protrusion during physiologically relevant guidance behavior . Conclusions Filopodia are dynamic structures and similar distri - butions of lengths and numbers of ﬁlopodia could result from different regulatory processes . In order to more fully understand the regulation of ﬁlopodial behavior , lifetime analysis of individual ﬁlopodia ( i . e . ‘birth’ and ‘death’ times , length histories , locations ) should be used to characterize the responses to different guidance cues . The results of Gehler et al . ( 2004b ) document the role of AC in the regulation of the length and number of growth cone ﬁlopodia ; however , the mechanisms underlying this control remain unclear . Activation of AC may increase ﬁlopodial length either by increas - ing the G - actin pool , thus enhancing polymerization at ﬁlopodial tips , or by modifying the actin meshwork within the transitional zone , making motor - based retraction of ﬁlopodial F - actin bundles less efﬁcient . Filopodial number may be regulated by AC proteins via enhancement of convergent elongation of lamel - lipodial F - actin ﬁlaments underlying the plasma mem - brane , thus making ﬁlopodial initiation more frequent . However , this mechanism has not yet been demon - strated fully in neurons . Further studies that use pho - tobleaching , photoactivation or speckle microscopy to track F - actin within ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia will be helpful in pinning down the mechanism by which AC regulates ﬁlopodial length and number .

The upper panels show a typical growth cone in the absence of any externally applied guidance cue . The white / red colors show the region of highest AC activity ( lowest levels of phosphorylated AC ) normalized for every growth cone to a region in the distal neurite shaft where each immunoﬂuorescent image is adjusted to the same intensity ( to correct for differences between antibody afﬁnities ) . Bottom panels show a growth cone turning away from an aggrecan stripe , which contains rhodamine dextran for visualization ; there is an accumulation of the active AC away from the repulsive guidance cue .
