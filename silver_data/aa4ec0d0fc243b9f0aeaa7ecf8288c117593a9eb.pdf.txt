Today , dynamic force microscopy allows us to image surfaces of conductors and insulators in vacuum with atomic resolution . The most widely used technique for atomic - resolution force microscopy in vacuum is frequency - modulation atomic force microscopy ( FM - AFM ) . This technique , as well as other dynamic methods , is explained in detail in this article . In the last few years many groups have expanded the empirical knowledge and deepened our theoretical understanding of frequency - modulation atomic force microscopy . Consequently spatial resolution and ease of use have been increased dramatically .

INTRODUCTION Imaging individual atoms was an elusive goal until the introduction of the scanning tunneling microscope ( STM ) in 1981 by Binnig , Rohrer , Gerber , and Weibel ( 1982 ) . This humble instrument has provided a break - through in our ability to investigate matter on the atomic scale : for the ﬁrst time , the individual surface atoms of ﬂat samples could be made visible in real space . Within one year of its invention , the STM helped to solve one of the most intriguing problems in surface sci - ence : the structure of the Si ( 111 ) - ( 7 ! 7 ) surface . The adatom layer of Si ( 111 ) - ( 7 ! 7 ) was imaged with an STM by Binnig et al . ( 1983 ) . This image , combined with x - ray - scattering and electron - scattering data helped Takayanagi , Tanishiro , Takahashi , and Takahashi ( 1985 ) to develop the dimer - adatom - stacking fault ( DAS ) model for Si ( 111 ) - ( 7 ! 7 ) . G . Binnig and H . Rohrer , the inventors of the STM , were rewarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986 . The historic initial steps and the rapid success of the STM , including the resolution of the silicon 7 ! 7 reconstruction , were described in their No - * Electronic address : Franz .

The spectacular spatial resolu - tion of the STM along with its intriguing simplicity launched a broad research effort with a signiﬁcant im - pact on surface science ( Mody , 2002 ) . A large number of metals and semiconductors have been investigated on the atomic scale and marvelous images of the world of atoms were created within the ﬁrst few years after the inception of the STM . Today , the STM is an invaluable asset in the surface scientist’s toolbox . Despite the phenomenal success of the STM , it has a serious limitation . It requires electrical conduction of the sample material , because it uses the tunneling cur - rent which ﬂows between a biased tip and a sample . However , early STM experiments showed that whenever the tip - sample distance was small enough that a current could ﬂow , signiﬁcant forces would act collaterally with the tunneling current . Soon it was speculated that these forces could be put to good use in the atomic force mi - croscope ( AFM ) . The force microscope was invented by Binnig ( 1986 ) and , shortly after its invention , Binnig , Quate , and Gerber ( 1986 ) introduced a working proto - type , while Binnig and Gerber spent a sabbatical at Stanford and the IBM Research Laboratory in Al - maden , California ( Riordon , 2003 ) . Binnig et al . ( 1986 ) were aware that , even during STM operation , signiﬁcant forces between single atoms are acting , and they were conﬁdent that the AFM could ultimately achieve true atomic resolution ( see Fig . 1 , adapted from Binnig et al . , 1986 ) . The STM can only image electrically conductive samples , which limits its application to the imaging of metals and semiconductors . But even conductors— except for a few special materials , like highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( HOPG ) —cannot be studied in ambi - ent conditions by STM but have to be investigated in an ultrahigh vacuum . In ambient conditions , the surface layer of solids constantly changes by adsorption and de - sorption of atoms and molecules . An ultrahigh vacuum is required for clean and well - deﬁned surfaces . Because electrical conductivity of the sample is not required in atomic force microscopy the AFM can image virtually any ﬂat solid surface without the need for surface prepa - ration . Consequently , thousands of AFM’s are in use in university , public , and industrial research laboratories all over the world . Most of these instruments are operated in ambient conditions . For studying surfaces on the atomic level , an ultrahigh - vacuum environment is required , where it is more difﬁcult to operate an AFM . In addition to the experimental challenges of the STM , the AFM faces four more substantial experimental complications , which are summarized in Sec . III . While Binnig , Quate , and Gerber ( 1986 ) anticipated the true atomic resolution ca - pability of the AFM from the beginning , it took ﬁve years before atomic resolution on inert surfaces could be demonstrated ( Giessibl , 1991 ; Giessibl and Binnig , 1992b ; Ohnesorge and Binnig , 1993 ; see Sec . IV ) . Re - solving reactive surfaces by AFM with atomic resolution took almost a decade from the invention of the AFM . The Si ( 111 ) - ( 7 ! 7 ) surface , a touchstone of the AFM’s feasibility as a tool for surface science , was resolved with atomic resolution by dynamic atomic force microscopy ( Giessibl , 1995 ) . The new microscopy mode has proven to work as a standard method , and in 1997 Seizo Morita from Osaka University in Japan initiated an interna - tional workshop on the subject of ‘‘noncontact atomic force microscopy . ’’ A year later , the ‘‘First International Workshop on Non - contact Atomic Force Microscopy ( NC - AFM ) ’’ was held in Osaka , Japan with about 80 attendees . This meeting was followed in 1999 by one in Pontresina ( Switzerland ) with roughly 120 participants and the ‘‘Third International Conference on Noncontact Atomic Force Microscopy ( NC - AFM ) ’’ in Hamburg , Germany in 2000 with more than 200 participants . A fourth meeting took place in September 2001 in Kyoto , Japan , and the 2002 conference met at McGill Univer - sity in Montreal , Canada . The next meeting is scheduled for Ireland in Summer 2003 . The proceedings for these workshops and conferences ( Morita and Tsukada , 1999 ; Bennewitz , Pfeiffer , et al . , 2000 ; Schwarz et al . , 2001 ; Tsukada and Morita , 2002 ; Hoffmann , 2003 ) and a re - cent review by Garcia and Perez ( 2002 ) are a rich source of information about atomic force microscopy and its role in surface science . Also , a multiauthor book about NC - AFM has recently become available ( Morita et al . , 2002 ) . The introduction of this book ( Morita , 2002 ) cov - ers interesting aspects of the history of the AFM . This review can only cover a part of the ﬁeld , and the author must apologize to the colleagues whose work he was not able to treat in the depth it deserved . However , many of these publications are listed in the bibliography and ref - erences therein . II . PRINCIPLE OF ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPY A . Relation to scanning tunneling microscopy The AFM is closely related to the STM , and it shares its key components , except for the probe tip . The prin - ciple of the STM is explained very well in many excel - lent books and review articles , e . g . , those of Binnig and Rohrer ( 1985 , 1987 , 1999 ) ; Gu ¨ ntherodt and Wiesendan - ger ( 1991 ) ; Chen ( 1993 ) ; Stroscio and Kaiser ( 1994 ) ; and Wiesendanger ( 1994 , 1998 ) . Nevertheless , the key prin - ciple of the STM is described here because the addi - tional challenges faced by the AFM become apparent FIG . 1 . Scanning tunneling microscope ( STM ) or atomic force microscope ( AFM ) tip close to a sample [ Fig . 1 ( a ) of Binnig et al . ( 1986 ) ] . 950 Franz J . Giessibl : Advances in atomic force microscopy Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 75 , No . 3 , July 2003 clearly in a direct comparison . Figure 2 shows the gen - eral setup of a scanning tunneling microscope ( STM ) : a sharp tip is mounted on a scanning device known as an xyz scanner , which allows three - dimensional positioning in the x , y , and z directions with subatomic precision . The tunneling tip is typically a wire that has been sharp - ened by chemical etching or mechanical grinding . W , Pt - Ir , or pure Ir are often chosen as the tip material . A bias voltage V t is applied to the sample , and when the dis - tance between tip and sample is in the range of several angstroms , a tunneling current I t ﬂows between the tip and sample . This current is used as the feedback signal in a z - feedback loop . In the topographic mode , images are created by scan - ning the tip in the xy plane and recording the z position required to keep I t constant . In the constant - height mode , the probe scans rapidly so that the feedback can - not follow the atomic corrugations . The atoms are then apparent as modulations of I t , which are recorded as a function of x and y . The scanning is usually performed in a raster fashion with a fast scanning direction ( saw - tooth or sinusoidal signal ) and a slow scanning direction ( sawtooth signal ) . A computer controls the scanning of the surface in the xy plane while recording the z posi - tion of the tip ( topographic mode ) or I t ( constant - height mode ) . Thus a three - dimensional image z ( x , y , I t ! const ) or I t ( x , y , z ! const ) is created . In the AFM , the tunneling tip is replaced by a force - sensing cantilever . The tunneling tip can also be re - placed by an optical near - ﬁeld probe , a microthermom - eter etc . , giving rise to a whole family of scanning probe microscopes ( see Wickramasinghe , 1989 ) . 1 . Tunneling current in scanning tunneling microscopy In an STM , a sharp tip is brought close to an electri - cally conductive surface that is biased at a voltage V t . When the separation is small enough , a current I t ﬂows between them . The typical distance between tip and sample under these conditions is a few atomic diameters , and the transport of electrons occurs by tunneling . When ! V t ! is small compared to the work function " , the tunneling barrier is roughly rectangular ( see Fig . 3 ) with a width z and a height given by the work function " . According to elementary quantum mechanics , the tun - neling current is given by I t # z $ " I 0 e # 2 % t z . ( 1 ) I 0 is a function of the applied voltage and the density of states in both tip and sample and % t " ! 2 m " / & , ( 2 ) where m is the mass of the electron and & is Planck’s constant . For metals , " ! 4 eV , thus % t ! 1 Å # 1 . When z is increased by one angstrom , the current drops by an order of magnitude . This strong distance dependence is pivotal for the atomic resolution capability of the STM . Most of the tunneling current is carried by the atom that is closest to the sample ( the ‘‘front atom’’ ) . If the sample is very ﬂat , this front atom remains the atom that is clos - est to the sample during scanning in x and y , and even relatively blunt tips yield atomic resolution easily . 2 . Experimental measurement and noise The tunneling current is measured with a current - to - voltage converter ( see Fig . 4 ) , a simple form of which consists merely of a single operational ampliﬁer ( OPA ) with low noise and low input bias current , and a feed - back resistor with a typical impedance of R " 100 M ’ and small parasitic capacitance . The tunneling current I t is used to measure the distance between tip and sample . The noise in the imaging signal ( the tunneling current in an STM , force or some derived quantity in an AFM ) needs to be small enough that the corresponding vertical noise ( z is considerably smaller than the atomic corru - gation of the sample . In the following , the noise levels FIG . 2 . A scanning tunneling microscope ( schematic ) . FIG . 3 . Energy diagram of an idealized tunneling gap . The image charge effect ( see Chen , 1993 ) is not taken into account here . FIG . 4 . A simple current - to - voltage converter for an STM and for the qPlus sensor shown in Fig . 11 . It consists of an opera - tional ampliﬁer with high speed , low noise , and low input bias current , as well as a feedback resistor ( typical impedance R ! 10 8 ’ ) that has low parasitic capacitance . The output volt - age is given by V out " # R ! I t . 951 Franz J . Giessibl : Advances in atomic force microscopy Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 75 , No . 3 , July 2003 for imaging signals and vertical positions are described by the root - mean - square ( rms ) deviation of the mean value and indicated by the preﬁx ( , i . e . , ( ) * ! + # ) # + ) , $ 2 , . ( 3 ) To achieve atomic resolution with an STM or AFM , a ﬁrst necessary condition is that the mechanical vibra - tions between tip and sample be smaller than the atomic corrugations . This condition is met by a microscope de - sign emphasizing utmost stability and establishing proper vibration isolation , such as is described by Kuk and Silverman ( 1988 ) ; Chen ( 1993 ) ; or Park and Barrett ( 1993 ) . In the following , proper mechanical design and vibration isolation will be presumed and are not dis - cussed further . The inherent vertical noise in an STM is connected to the noise in the current measurement . Fig - ure 5 shows the qualitative dependence of the tunneling current I t on vertical distance z . Because the measure - ment of I t is subject to noise , the vertical distance mea - surement is also subject to a noise level ( z : ( z I t " ( I t " - I t - z " . ( 4 ) It is shown below that the noise in the current measure - ment ( I t is small and that - I t / - z is quite large ; conse - quently the vertical noise in an STM is very small . The dominating noise sources in the tunneling current are the Johnson noise of the feedback resistor R in the current ampliﬁer , the Johnson noise in the tunneling junction , and the input noise of the operational ampli - ﬁer . The Johnson noise density of a resistor R at tem - perature T is given by ( Horowitz and Hill , 1989 ) n R " ! 4 k B TR , ( 5 ) where k B is the Boltzmann constant . In typical STM’s , the tunneling current is of the order of I t ! 100 pA and is measured with an acquisition bandwidth of B ! 1 kHz , where B is roughly determined by the spatial frequency of features that are to be scanned times the scanning speed . Thus , for a spatial frequency of 4 atoms / nm and a scanning speed of 250 nm / s , a bandwidth of B " 1 kHz is sufﬁcient to map each atom as a single sinusoidal wave . With a gain of V / I " R " 100 M ’ and T " 300 K , the rms voltage noise is n i ! B " ! 4 k B TRB " 40 . V at room tem - perature , corresponding to a current noise of ( I t " 0 . 4 pA . With Eqs . ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) , the vertical noise is ( z I t ! ! 4 k B TB / R 2 % t ! I t ! , ( 6 ) which amounts to a z noise of 0 . 2 pm in the present example . Thus in an STM the thermal noise in the tun - neling current is not critical , because it is much smaller than the required resolution . It is interesting to note that the noise in an STM increases proportional to the square root of the required bandwidth B , a moderate rate com - pared to the B 1 . 5 dependence which holds for frequency - modulation atomic force microscopy [ see Eq . ( 53 ) ] . The spectacular spatial resolution and relative ease of obtaining atomic resolution by scanning tunneling mi - croscopy rests on three properties of the tunneling cur - rent : • As a consequence of the strong distance dependence of the tunneling current , even with a relatively blunt tip the chance is high that a single atom protrudes far enough out of the tip that it carries the main part of the tunneling current ; • Typical tunneling currents are in the nanoampere range—measuring currents of this magnitude can be done with a very good signal - to - noise ratio even with a simple experimental setup ; • Because the tunneling current is a monotonic function of the tip - sample distance , it is easy to establish a feedback loop that controls the distance so that the current is constant . It is shown in the next section that none of these con - ditions is met in the case of the AFM , and therefore substantial hurdles had to be overcome before atomic resolution by AFM became possible . B . Tip - sample forces F ts The AFM is similar to an STM , except that the tun - neling tip is replaced by a force sensor . Figure 6 shows a sharp tip close to a sample . The potential energy be - tween the tip and sample V ts causes a z component of the tip - sample force F ts " # - V ts / - z and a tip - sample FIG . 5 . Tunneling current as a function of distance and rela - tion between current noise ( I t and vertical noise ( z ( arbitrary units ) . FIG . 6 . ( Color in online edition ) Schematic view of an AFM tip close to a sample . Chemical short - range forces act when tip and sample orbitals ( crescents ) overlap . Long range forces ( in - dicated with arrows ) originate in the full volume and surface of the tip and are a critical function of the mesoscopic tip shape . 952 Franz J . Giessibl : Advances in atomic force microscopy Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 75 , No . 3 , July 2003 spring constant k ts " # - F ts / - z . Depending on the mode of operation , the AFM uses F ts or some entity derived from F ts as the imaging signal . Unlike the tunneling current , which has a very short range , F ts has long - and short - range contributions . We can classify the contributions by their range and strength . In vacuum , there are short - range chemical forces ( fractions of nm ) and van der Waals , electrostatic , and magnetic forces with a long range ( up to 100 nm ) . In ambient conditions , meniscus forces formed by adhesion layers on tip and sample ( water or hydrocarbons ) can also be present . A prototype of the chemical bond is treated in many textbooks on quantum mechanics ( see , for example , Baym , 1969 ) : the H 2 $ ion is a model for the covalent bond . This quantum - mechanical problem can be solved analytically and gives interesting insights into the char - acter of chemical bonds . The Morse potential ( see , for example , Israelachvili , 1991 ) V Morse " # E bond # 2 e # % ( z # / ) # e # 2 % ( z # / ) $ ( 7 ) describes a chemical bond with bonding energy E bond , equilibrium distance / , and a decay length % . With a proper choice of E bond , / , and % , the Morse potential is an excellent ﬁt for the exact solution of the H 2 $ prob - lem . The Lennard - Jones potential ( see , for example , Ash - croft and Mermin , 1981 ; Israelachvili , 1991 ) , V Lennard - Jones " # E bond # 2 z 6 / 6 # z 12 / 12 $ , ( 8 ) has an attractive term 0 r # 6 originating from the van der Waals interaction ( see below ) and a repulsive term 0 r # 12 . While the Morse potential can be used for a qualita - tive description of chemical forces , it lacks an important property of chemical bonds : anisotropy . Chemical bonds , especially covalent bonds , show an inherent angular de - pendence of the bonding strength ( see Pauling , 1957 and Coulson and McWeeny , 1991 ) . Empirical models which take the directionality of covalent bonds into account are the Stillinger - Weber potential ( Stillinger and Weber , 1985 ) , the Tersoff potential , and others . For a review see Bazant and Kaxiras ( 1997 ) and references therein . The Stillinger - Weber ( SW ) potential appears to be a valid model for the interaction of silicon tips with silicon samples in AFM . As Bazant and Kaxiras ( 1997 ) write , ‘‘ Although the various terms [ of the Stillinger - Weber potential ] lose their physical signiﬁcance for distortions of the diamond lattice large enough to destroy sp 3 hy - bridization , the SW potential seems to give a reasonable description of many states experimentally relevant , such as point defects , certain surface structures , and the liquid and amorphous states ’’ ( Bazant and Kaxiras , 1997 ) . Using the Stillinger - Weber potential , one can explain subatomic features in Si images ( Giessibl , Hembacher , et al . , 2000 ) . Qualitatively , these ﬁndings have been re - produced with ab initio calculations ( Huang et al . , 2003 ) . The Stillinger - Weber potential necessarily contains nearest - and next - nearest - neighbor interactions . Unlike solids with a face - centered - cubic or body - centered - cubic lattice structure , solids that crystallize in the diamond structure are unstable when only next - neighbor interac - tions are taken into account . The nearest - neighbor con - tribution of the Stillinger - Weber potential is V n # r $ " E bond A % B # r / ! $ # p # # r / ! $ # q & ! e 1 / # r / / ! # a $ for r % a / ! , else V nn # r $ " 0 .

( 11 ) Stillinger and Weber found optimal agreement with ex - perimental data for the following parameters : A " 7 . 049 556 277 , p " 4 , 5 " 1 . 20 , B " 0 . 602 2245 584 , q " 0 , 4 " 21 . 0 , E bond " 3 . 4723 aJ , a " 1 . 8 , / !

The potential is constructed in such a way as to ensure that V n and V nn and all their derivatives with respect to distance vanish for r & a / ! " 3 . 7718 Å . The diamond structure is favored by the Stillinger - Weber po - tential because of the factor ( cos 2 $ 13 ) 2 —this factor is zero when 2 equals the tetrahedron bond angle of 2 " 109 . 47° . With increasing computer power , it becomes more and more feasible to perform ab initio calculations for tip - sample forces . See , for example , Perez et al . ( 1997 , 1998 ) ; Ke et al . ( 2001 ) ; Tobik et al . ( 2001 ) ; Huang et al . ( 2003 ) . The van der Waals interaction is caused by ﬂuctua - tions in the electric dipole moment of atoms and their mutual polarization . For two atoms at distance z , the energy varies as 1 / z 6 ( Baym , 1969 ) . Assuming additivity and disregarding the discrete nature of matter by replac - ing the sum over individual atoms by an integration over a volume with a ﬁxed number density of atoms , the van der Waals interaction between macroscopic bodies can be calculated by the Hamaker approach ( Hamaker , 1937 ) . This approach does not account for retardation effects due to the ﬁnite speed of light and is therefore only appropriate for distances up to several hundred angstroms . For a spherical tip with radius R next to a ﬂat surface ( z is the distance between the plane connecting the centers of the surface atoms and the center of the closest tip atom ) the van der Waals potential is given by ( Israelachvili , 1991 ) 953 Franz J . Giessibl : Advances in atomic force microscopy Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 75 , No . 3 , July 2003 V v dW " # A H R 6 z . ( 12 ) The van der Waals force for spherical tips is thus pro - portional to 1 / z 2 , while for pyramidal and conical tips , a 1 / z force law holds ( Giessibl , 1997 ) . The Hamaker con - stant A H depends on the type of materials ( atomic po - larizability and density ) of the tip and sample . For most solids and interactions across a vacuum , A H is of the order of 1 eV . For a list of A H for various materials , see Krupp ( 1967 ) and French ( 2000 ) . The van der Waals interaction can be quite large—the typical radius of an etched metal tip is 100 nm and with z " 0 . 5 nm , the van der Waals energy is ! # 30 eV , and the corresponding force is ! # 10 nN . Because of their magnitude , van der Waals forces are a major disturbance in force micros - copy . Ohnesorge and Binnig ( 1993 ) have shown ( see Sec . IV ) that large background van der Waals forces can be reduced dramatically by immersing the cantilever in water . A more modern approach to the calculation of van der Waals forces is described by Hartmann ( 1991 ) . When the tip and sample are both conductive and have an electrostatic potential difference U 6 0 , electro - static forces are important . For a spherical tip with ra - dius R , the potential energy is given by Sarid ( 1994 ) . If the distance between a ﬂat surface and a spherical tip with radius R is small compared to R , the force is ap - proximately given by ( see Olsson , Lin , Yakimov , and Er - landsson , 1998 ; Law and Rieutord , 2002 ) F electrostatic # z $ " # 78 0 RU 2 d . ( 13 ) Like the van der Waals interaction , the electrostatic in - teraction can also cause large forces—for a tip radius of 100 nm , U " 1 V , and z " 0 . 5 nm , the electrostatic force is ! # 5 . 5 nN . It is interesting to note that short - range van der Waals forces ( energy 0 1 / z 6 ) add up to long - range overall tip - sample forces because of their additivity . The opposite effect can occur with electrostatic forces : in ionic crys - tals , where adjacent atoms carry opposite charges , the envelope of the electrostatic ﬁeld has a short - range ex - ponential distance dependence ( Giessibl , 1992 ) . 1 C . The force sensor ( cantilever ) Tip - sample forces can vary strongly on the atomic scale , and Pethica ( 1986 ) has proposed that they even explain artifacts like giant corrugations apparent in STM experiments . However , it is difﬁcult to isolate force ef - fects in scanning tunneling microscopy , and a dedicated sensor for detecting forces is needed . The central ele - ment of a force microscope and its major instrumental difference from a scanning tunneling microscope is the spring which senses the force between tip and sample . For sensing normal tip - sample forces , the force sensor should be rigid in two axes and relatively soft in the third axis . This property is fulﬁlled with a cantilever beam , and therefore the cantilever geometry is typically used for force detectors . A generic cantilever is shown in Fig . 7 . For a rectangular cantilever with dimensions w , t , and L ( see Fig . 7 ) , the spring constant k is given by ( Chen , 1993 ) k " Ywt 3 4 L 3 , ( 14 ) where Y is Young’s modulus . The fundamental eigenfre - quency f 0 is given by ( Chen , 1993 ) f 0 " 0 . 162 t L 2 ! Y 9 , ( 15 ) where 9 is the mass density of the cantilever material . The properties of interest are the stiffness k , the eigenfrequency f 0 , the quality factor Q , the variation of the eigenfrequency with temperature - f 0 / - T , and of course the chemical and structural composition of the tip . The ﬁrst AFM’s were mostly operated in the static contact mode ( see below ) , and for this mode the stiff - ness of the cantilever should be less than the interatomic spring constants of atoms in a solid ( Rugar and Hansma , 1990 ) , which amounts to k : 10 N / m . This constraint on k was assumed to hold for dynamic atomic force micros - copy , as well . However , it turned out later that in dy - namic atomic force microscopy , k values exceeding hun - dreds of N / m help to reduce noise and increase stability ( Giessibl , Bielefeldt , et al . , 1999 ) . The Q factor depends on the damping mechanisms present in the cantilever . For micromachined cantilevers operated in air , Q is mainly limited by viscous drag and typically amounts to a few hundred , while in vacuum , internal and surface effects in the cantilever material are responsible for damping and Q reaches hundreds of thousands . The ﬁrst cantilevers were made from a gold foil with a small diamond tip attached to it ( Binnig , 1986 ) . Simple cantilevers can even be cut from household aluminum foil ( Rugar and Hansma , 1990 ) and etched tungsten wires ( McClelland et al . , 1987 ) . Later , silicon microma - chining technology was employed to build cantilevers in 1 More information about tip - sample forces can be found in Ciraci et al .

Phys . , Vol . 75 , No . 3 , July 2003 parallel production with well - deﬁned mechanical prop - erties . The ﬁrst micromachined cantilevers were built at Stanford in the group of Calvin F . Quate . Initially , mass - produced cantilevers were built from SiO 2 and Si 3 N 4 ( Albrecht et al . , 1990 ) . Later , cantilevers with integrated tips were machined from silicon - on - insulator wafers ( Akamine et al . , 1990 ) . The most common cantilevers in use today are built from all - silicon with integrated tips pointing in a [ 001 ] crystal direction ; these were devel - oped by Wolter , Bayer , and Greschner ( 1991 ) at IBM Sindelﬁngen , Germany . Figures 8 and 9 show the type of cantilevers that are mainly used today : micromachined silicon cantilevers with integrated tips . Tortonese , Bar - rett , and Quate ( 1993 ) have built self - sensing cantilevers with integrated tips and a built - in deﬂection - measuring scheme utilizing the piezoresistive effect in silicon ( see Fig . 10 ) . In dynamic atomic force microscopy , some require - ments for the force sensor are similar to the desired properties of the time - keeping element in a watch : ut - most frequency stability over time and temperature changes and little energy consumption . Around 1970 , the watch industry was revolutionized with the introduc - tion of quartz tuning forks as frequency standards in clocks ( Walls , 1985 ; Momosaki , 1997 ) . Billions of these devices are now manufactured annually , and the devia - tions of even low - cost watches are no more than a few seconds a week . Experimental studies of using quartz - based force sensors were carried out soon after the in - vention of the AFM . Gu¨thner et al . ( 1989 ) and Gu¨thner ( 1992 ) used tuning forks as force sensors in acoustic near - ﬁeld microscopy , while Karrai and Grober ( 1995 ) used a tuning fork to control the distance between the optical near - ﬁeld probe and the surface in a scanning near - ﬁeld - optical microscope . Bartzke et al . ( 1993 ) pro - posed the ‘‘needle sensor , ’’ a force sensor based on a quartz bar oscillator . Rychen et al . ( 1999 ) and Hem - bacher et al . ( 2002 ) demonstrated the use of quartz tun - ing forks at low temperature , and other applications of quartz tuning forks as force sensors can be found in Ed - wards et al . ( 1997 ) ; Ruiter et al . ( 1997 ) ; Todorovic and Schulz ( 1998 ) ; Tsai and Lu ( 1998 ) ; Wang ( 1998 ) ; and Rensen et al . ( 1999 ) . Quartz tuning forks have many at - tractive properties , but their geometry gives them marked disadvantages for use as force sensors . The great beneﬁt of the fork geometry is the high Q factor , which is a consequence of the presence of an oscillation mode in which both prongs oscillate opposite to each other . The dynamic forces necessary to keep the two prongs oscillating cancel in this case exactly . However , this only works if the eigenfrequency of both prongs matches pre - cisely . The mass of the tip mounted on one prong and the interaction of this tip with a sample breaks the sym - metry of tuning fork geometry . This problem can be avoided by ﬁxing one of the two beams and turning the fork symmetry into a cantilever symmetry , where the cantilever is attached to a high - mass substrate with a low - loss material . Figure 11 shows a quartz cantilever based on a quartz tuning fork ( Giessibl , 1996 , 1998 , 2000 ) . Quartz tuning forks are available in several sizes . We have found optimal performance with the type of tuning fork used in Swatch wristwatches . In contrast to micromachined silicon cantilevers , the quartz forks are large . Therefore a wide selection of tips can be mounted FIG . 8 .

Giessibl : Advances in atomic force microscopy Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 75 , No . 3 , July 2003 on a tuning fork with the mere help of tweezers and a stereoscopic microscope—sophisticated micromachining equipment is not needed . Tips made from tungsten , dia - mond , silicon , iron , cobalt , samarium , CoSm permanent magnets , and iridium have been built in our laboratory for various purposes . Figure 12 shows a quartz cantilever oriented for lateral force detection ( see Sec . X . D ; Giessibl , Herz , and Mannhart , 2002 ) . Piezoelectric sen - sors based on thin ﬁlms of materials with much higher piezoelectric constants than quartz ( Itoh et al . , 1996 ) are also available . However , these devices lack the very low internal dissipation and high - frequency stability of quartz . The general advantage of piezoelectric sensors versus piezoresistive sensors is that the latter dissipate power in the mW range , while electric dissipation is neg - ligible in piezoelectric sensors . Therefore piezoelectric sensors are preferred over piezoresistive schemes for low - temperature applications . 1 . Cantilever tips For atomic - resolution atomic force microscopy , the front atom of the tip should ideally be the only atom that interacts strongly with the sample . In order to re - duce the forces caused by the shaft of the tip , the tip radius should be as small as possible ( see Sec . II . B ) . Cantilevers made of silicon with integrated tips are typi - cally oriented so that the tip points in the [ 001 ] crystal direction . Due to the anisotropic etching rates of Si and SiO 2 , these tips can be etched so that they develop a very sharp apex ( Marcus et al . , 1990 ) , as shown in Fig . 13 . Recently , it has turned out that not only the sharp - ness of a tip is important for atomic force microscopy , but also the coordination of the front atom . Tip and sample can be viewed as two giant molecules ( Chen , 1993 ) . In chemical reactions between two atoms or mol - ecules , the chemical identity and the spatial arrange - ment of both partners plays a crucial role . For atomic force microscopy with true atomic resolution , the chemi - cal identity and bonding conﬁguration of the front atom is therefore critical . In [ 001 ] - oriented silicon tips , the front atom exposes two dangling bonds ( if bulk termina - tion is assumed ) and has only two connecting bonds to the rest of the tip . If we assume bulk termination , it is immediately evident that tips pointing in the [ 111 ] direc - tion are more stable , because then the front atom has three bonds to the rest of the tip ( see Figs . 14 ) . In a simple picture where only nearest - neighbor interactions are contributing signiﬁcantly to the bonding energy , the front atom of a [ 111 ] - oriented silicon tip has 3 / 4 of the bulk atomic bonding energy . For a [ 111 ] - oriented metal tip with fcc bulk structure , the bonding energy of the front atom has only 3 / 12 of the bulk value . This trivial picture might explain why silicon can be imaged with atomic resolution using positive frequency shifts ( i . e . , re - pulsive forces ) with a [ 111 ] silicon tip ( to be discussed below ) . Even if the [ 111 ] sidewalls of these tips recon - struct to , say , Si 7 ! 7 , the front atom is ﬁxed by three bonds , and a very stable tip should emerge . Figure 15 shows a tip with [ 111 ] orientation . The tip is cleaved from a silicon wafer . Experiments show that these tips can come very close to a surface without getting dam - aged ( Giessibl , Hembacher , et al . , 2001b ) . 2 . Measurement of cantilever deﬂection and noise In the ﬁrst AFM , the deﬂection of the cantilever was measured with an STM . The backside of the cantilever FIG . 12 . ( Color in online edition ) Micrograph of a ‘‘qPlus’’ lateral force sensor . The lateral force sensor is similar to the normal force sensor in Fig . 11 .

( Color in online edition ) Micrograph of a ‘‘qPlus’’ sensor—a cantilever made from a quartz tuning fork . One of the prongs is ﬁxed to a large substrate and a tip is mounted to the free prong .

Phys . , Vol . 75 , No . 3 , July 2003 was metalized , and a tunneling tip was brought close to it to measure the deﬂection ( Binnig et al . , 1986 ) . While the tunneling effect is very sensitive to distance varia - tions , this method has a number of drawbacks : • It is difﬁcult to position a tunneling tip so that it aligns with the very small area at the end of the cantilever . • The tunneling tip exerts forces on the cantilever , and it is impossible to distinguish between forces caused by cantilever - sample and cantilever - tunneling tip in - teractions . • When the cantilever is deﬂected , the lateral position of the tip on the backside of the cantilever is shifted . The atomic roughness of the cantilever backside along with the lateral motion results in a nonlinear deﬂec - tion signal . Subsequent designs used optical ( interferometer , beam - bounce ) or electrical methods ( piezoresistive , piezoelec - tric ) for measuring the cantilever deﬂection . The deﬂec - tion of silicon cantilevers is most commonly measured by optical detection through an interferometer or by bouncing a light beam off the cantilever and measuring its deﬂection ( the ‘‘beam bounce method’’ ) . For detailed descriptions of these techniques , see Sarid ( 1994 ) ; opti - cal detection techniques are discussed extensively by Howald ( 1994 ) . The deﬂection of piezoresistive cantile - vers is usually measured by making them part of a Wheatstone bridge ( see Tortonese et al . , 1993 ) . The deﬂection of the cantilever is subject to thermal drift and other noise factors . This can be expressed in a plot of the deﬂection noise density versus frequency . A typical noise density is plotted in Fig . 16 , showing a 1 / f dependence for low frequency that merges into a con - stant noise density ( ‘‘white noise’’ ) above the ‘‘1 / f corner frequency . ’’ This 1 / f noise is also apparent in macro - scopic force - sensing devices , such as scales . Typically , scales have a reset or zero button , which allows the user to reset the effects of long - term drift . Machining AFM’s from materials with low thermal expansion coefﬁcients FIG . 13 .

The 15 – 20 - Å - thick coating of the tip is mostly due to hydrocarbons which have been po - lymerized by the electron beam . Interestingly , the crystal struc - ture appears to remain bulklike up to the apex of the tip . From Marcus et al . , 1990 . FIG . 14 .

Thermal stability A change in temperature can cause bending of the cantilever and a change in its eigenfrequency . In this re - spect , quartz is clearly superior to silicon as a cantilever material , as quartz can be cut along speciﬁc crystal ori - entations such that the variation of oscillation frequency of a tuning fork or cantilever is zero for a certain tem - perature T 0 . For quartz cut in the X $ 5° direction , T 0 ! 300 K , see , for example , Momosaki ( 1997 ) . This can - not be accomplished with silicon cantilevers . In the dy - namic operating modes ( see Sec . VI ) , drifts in f 0 , caused by variations in temperature , add to the vertical noise . The eigenfrequency [ see Eq . ( 27 ) ] is determined by the spring constant and the effective mass of the cantilever . The spring constant changes with temperature , due to thermal expansion and the change of Young’s modulus Y with temperature . Changes in the effective mass due to picking up a few atoms from the sample or transfer - ring some atoms from the tip to the sample are insigniﬁ - cant , because a typical cantilever contains at least 10 14 atoms . The resonance frequency of a cantilever is given in Eq . ( 15 ) . With the velocity of sound in the cantilever material v s " ! Y / 9 , Eq . ( 15 ) can be expressed as ( Chen , 1993 ) f 0 " 0 . 162 v s t L 2 . ( 16 ) The temperature dependence of the eigenfrequency is then given by 1 f 0 - f 0 - T " 1 v s - v s - T # ; , ( 17 ) where ; is the thermal expansion coefﬁcient . For silicon oriented along the [ 110 ] crystal direction ( see Fig . 7 ) , ( 1 / v s ) ( - v s / - T ) " # 5 . 5 ! 10 # 5 K # 1 and ; " 2 . 55 ! 10 # 6 K # 1 at T " 290 K ( Kuchling , 1982 ; Madelung , 1982 ) . The resulting relative frequency shift for ( rectangular ) silicon cantilevers is then # 5 . 8 ! 10 # 5 K # 1 . This is a large noise source in classical FM - AFM , where relative frequency shifts can be as small as # 6 Hz / 151 kHz " # 4 ! 10 # 5 ( see row 5 in Table I ) and a temperature variation of < T " $ 0 . 69 K causes an equal shift in resonance fre - quency . The drift of f 0 with temperature is much smaller for cantilevers made of quartz . Figure 17 shows a com - parison of typical frequency variations as a function of temperature for silicon and quartz . The data for silicon are calculated with Eq . ( 17 ) , the quartz data are taken from Momosaki ( 1997 ) . As can be seen , quartz is re - markably stable at room temperature compared to sili - con . Less signiﬁcant noise sources , like the thermal ﬂuc - tuation of A , are discussed by Giessibl , Bielefeldt , et al . ( 1999 ) . Hembacher et al . ( 2002 ) have measured the fre - quency variations of a quartz tuning fork sensor from room temperature to 5 K . D . Operating modes of AFM’s 1 . Static atomic force microscopy In AFM , the force F ts which acts between the tip and sample is used as the imaging signal . In the static mode of operation , the force translates into a deﬂection q ! " F ts / k of the cantilever . Because the deﬂection of the cantilever should be signiﬁcantly larger than the defor - mation of the tip and sample , restrictions on the useful range of k apply . In the static mode , the cantilever should be much softer than the bonds between the bulk atoms in tip and sample . Interatomic force constants in solids are in a range from 10 N / m to about 100 N / m—in biological samples , they can be as small as 0 . 1 N / m . Thus typical values for k in the static mode are 0 . 01 – 5 N / m . The eigenfrequency f 0 should be signiﬁcantly higher than the desired detection bandwidth , i . e . , if ten lines per second are recorded during imaging a width of say 100 atoms , f 0 should be at least 10 ! 2 ! 100 s # 1 " 2 kHz in order to prevent resonant excitation of the cantilever . Even though it has been demonstrated that atomic resolution is possible with static atomic force microscopy ( Giessibl and Binnig , 1992b ; Ohnesorge and Binng , 1993 ; Schimmel et al . , 1999 ) , the method can only be applied in certain cases . The magnitude of 1 / f noise can be reduced by low - temperature operation ( Giessibl , 1992 ) , where the coefﬁcients of thermal expansion are very small , or by building the AFM of a material with a low thermal expansion coefﬁcient . The long - range at - tractive forces have to be canceled by immersing tip and sample in a liquid ( Ohnesorge and Binnig , 1993 ) or by partly compensating for the attractive force by pulling at the cantilever after jump - to - contact has occurred ( Giessibl , 1991 , 1992 ; Giessibl and Binnig , 1992b ) . Jarvis et al . ( 1997 , 1996 ) have introduced a method for cancel - ling the long - range attractive force with an electromag - netic force applied to the cantilever . While the experimental realization of static atomic force microscopy is difﬁcult , the physical interpretation FIG . 16 . Noise spectrum of a typical cantilever deﬂection de - tector ( schematic ) , characterized by 1 / f noise for low frequen - cies and white noise for intermediate frequencies . For very high frequencies , the deﬂection noise density of typical canti - lever deﬂection sensors goes up again ( ‘‘blue noise , ’’ not shown here ) . 958 Franz J .

Dynamic atomic force microscopy In the dynamic operation modes , the cantilever is de - liberately vibrated . The cantilever is mounted on an ac - tuator to allow the external excitation of an oscillation . There are two basic methods of dynamic operation : amplitude - modulation ( AM ) and frequency - modulation ( FM ) operation . In AM - AFM ( Martin , Williams , and Wickramasinghe , 1987 ) , the actuator is driven by a ﬁxed amplitude A dri v e at a ﬁxed frequency f dri v e , where f dri v e is close to but different from f 0 . When the tip ap - proaches the sample , elastic and inelastic interactions cause a change in both the amplitude and the phase ( relative to the driving signal ) of the cantilever . These changes are used as the feedback signal . The change in amplitude in AM mode does not occur instantaneously with a change in the tip - sample interaction , but on a time scale of = AM ! 2 Q / f 0 . With Q factors reaching 100 000 in vacuum , the AM mode is very slow . Albrecht , Grutter , Horne , and Rugar ( 1991 ) solved this problem by introducing the frequency - modulation ( FM ) mode , in which the change in the eigenfrequency occurs within a single oscillation cycle on a time scale of = FM ! 1 / f 0 . Both AM and FM modes were initially meant to be ‘‘noncontact’’ modes , i . e . , the cantilever was far away from the surface and the net force between the front atom of the tip and the sample was clearly attractive . The AM mode was later used very successfully at a closer distance range in ambient conditions involving re - pulsive tip - sample interactions ( ‘‘Tapping Mode’’ ; Zhong et al . , 1993 ) , and Erlandsson et al . ( 1997 ) obtained atomic resolution on Si in vacuum with an etched tung - sten cantilever operated in AM mode in 1996 . Using the FM mode in vacuum improved the resolution dramati - FIG . 17 .

CHALLENGES FACED BY ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPY WITH RESPECT TO SCANNING TUNNELING MICROSCOPY In a scanning tunneling microscope , a tip has to be scanned across a surface with a precision of picometers while a feedback mechanism adjusts the z position such that the tunneling current is constant . This task seems daunting , and the successful realization of scanning tun - neling microscopy is an amazing accomplishment . Yet , implementing an AFM capable of atomic resolution poses even more obstacles . Some of these challenges be - come apparent when comparing the characteristics of the physical observables used in the two types of micro - scopes . Figure 18 is a plot of tunneling current and tip - sample force as a function of distance . For experimental measurements of force and tunneling current , see , for example , Schirmeisen et al . ( 2000 ) . The tunneling cur - rent is a monotonic function of the tip - sample distance and increases sharply with decreasing distance . In con - trast , the tip - sample force has long - and short - range components and is not monotonic . A . Stability van der Waals forces in vacuum are always attractive , and if chemical bonding between tip and sample can occur , the chemical forces are also attractive for dis - tances greater than the equilibrium distance . Because the tip is mounted on a spring , approaching the tip can cause a sudden jump - to - contact when the stiffness of the cantilever is less than a certain value . This instability occurs in the quasistatic mode if k % max # # - 2 V ts - z 2 $ " k ts max ( 18 ) ( Tabor and Winterton , 1969 ; McClelland et al . , 1987 ; Burnham and Colton , 1989 ) . The jump - to - contact can be avoided even for soft cantilevers by oscillating the can - tilever at a large enough amplitude A : kA & max # # F ts $ " F ts max ( 19 ) ( Giessibl , 1997 ) . If hysteresis occurs in the F ts ( z ) rela - tion , the energy < E ts needs to be supplied to the canti - lever for each oscillation cycle . If this energy loss is large compared to the intrinsic energy loss of the cantilever , amplitude control can become difﬁcult [ see the discus - sion after Eq . ( 47 ) ] . A new conjecture regarding k and A is then k 2 A 2 > < E ts Q 2 7 . ( 20 ) The validity of these criteria is supported by an analysis of the values of k and A for many NC - AFM experi - ments with atomic resolution in Table I . Fulﬁlment of the stability criteria thus requires either the use of large amplitudes , cantilevers with large spring constants , or both . However , using large amplitudes has critical disadvantages , which are discussed in Sec . VIII . B . Nonmonotonic imaging signal The magnitude of the tunneling current increases con - tinuously as the tip - sample distance decreases , i . e . , the tunneling current is a strictly monotonic decreasing function of the distance ( see Fig . 5 in Sec . II . A . 2 above ) . This property allows a simple implementation of a feed - back loop : the tunneling current is fed into a logarithmic ampliﬁer to produce an error signal that is linear with the tip - sample distance . In contrast , the tip - sample force is not monotonic . In general , the force is attractive for large distances , and upon decreasing the distance between tip and sample , the force turns repulsive ( see Fig . 18 ) . Stable feedback is only possible on a branch of the force curve , where it is monotonic . Because the tunneling current is monotonic over the whole distance range , whereas the tip - sample force is not , it is much easier to establish a z distance feedback loop for an STM than for an AFM . C . Contribution of long - range forces The force between tip and sample is composed of many contributions : electrostatic , magnetic , van der Waals , and chemical forces in vacuum . In ambient con - ditions there are also meniscus forces . While electro - static , magnetic , and meniscus forces can be eliminated by equalizing the electrostatic potential between tip and sample , using nonmagnetic tips , and operating in vacuum , the van der Waals forces cannot be switched off . For imaging by AFM with atomic resolution , it is desirable to ﬁlter out the long - range force contributions FIG . 18 .

Giessibl : Advances in atomic force microscopy Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 75 , No . 3 , July 2003 and measure only the force components that vary at the atomic scale . In an STM , the rapid decay of the tunnel - ing current with distance naturally blocks contributions of tip atoms that are further distant from the sample , even for fairly blunt tips . In contrast , in static atomic force microscopy , long - and short - range forces add up to the imaging signal . In dynamic atomic force microscopy , attenuation of the long - range contributions is achieved by proper choice of the cantilever’s oscillation amplitude A ( see Sec . VII . A . 3 ) . D . Noise in the imaging signal Forces can be measured by the deﬂection of a spring . However , measuring the deﬂection is not a trivial task and is subject to noise , especially at low frequencies ( 1 / f noise ) . In static atomic force microscopy , the imaging signal is given by the dc deﬂection of the cantilever , which is subject to 1 / f noise . In dynamic atomic force microscopy , the low - frequency noise is discriminated if the eigenfrequency f 0 is larger than the 1 / f corner fre - quency . With a bandpass ﬁlter with a center frequency around f 0 , only the white noise density is integrated across the bandwidth B of the bandpass ﬁlter . Frequency - modulation atomic force microscopy , de - scribed in detail in Sec . VI , helps to overcome three of these four challenges . The nonmonotonic force - vs - distance relation is a remaining complication for atomic force microscopy . IV . EARLY AFM EXPERIMENTS The ﬁrst description of the AFM by Binnig et al . ( 1986 ) already lists several possible ways to operate the microscope : contact and noncontact , static , and dynamic modes . Initially , AFM’s were mainly operated in the static contact mode . However , soon after the invention of the AFM , Du¨rig , Gimzewski , and Pohl ( 1986 ) mea - sured the forces acting during tunneling in an STM in ultrahigh vacuum with a dynamic technique . In these experiments , the interaction between a tungsten STM tip and a thin ﬁlm of Ag condensed on a metal cantilever was studied . The thermally excited oscillation of the metal cantilever was observed in the spectrum of the tunneling current , and the force gradient between tip and sample caused a shift in the resonance frequency of the cantilever . In a later experiment , Du¨rig , Zu¨ger , and Pohl ( 1990 ) used Ir tips and an Ir sample . While varia - tions of the force on atomic scale were not reported in these experiments , it was shown that both repulsive ( W tip , Ag sample ) and attractive forces ( Ir tip , Ir sample ) of the order of a few nN could act during STM opera - tion . G . Binnig , Ch . Gerber , and others started the IBM Physics Group at the Ludwig - Maximilian - Universita¨t in Munich . The author joined this group in May 1988 and helped to build a low - temperature ultrahigh - vacuum AFM to probe the resolution limits of the AFM . If atomic resolution was possible , we thought that the best bet would be to try it at low temperatures in order to minimize the detrimental effects of thermal noise . The microscope was ﬁtted to a quite complex vacuum system which was designed by G . Binnig , Ch . Gerber , and T . Heppell with colleagues from VG Special Systems , Hastings , England . Because it was anticipated that the design of the instrument would have to go through many iterations involving the breaking of the vacuum , the vacuum system was designed in an effort to keep the bakeout time short and to allow rapid cooling to 4 K ( see Giessibl , Gerber , and Binnig , 1991 ) . Our instrument could resolve atoms in STM mode on graphite at T " 4 K in 1989 , but AFM operation with atomic resolu - tion was not yet possible . As AFM test samples , we used ionic crystals and in particular alkali halides . Alkali ha - lides can be viewed as consisting of hard spheres that are charged by plus / minus one elementary charge ( Ashcroft and Mermin , 1981 ) . These materials are easily prepared by cleaving in vacuum , where large [ 001 ] planes with fairly low step densities develop . In late 1989 , E . Meyer et al . ( Meyer , Heinzelmann , Rudin , and Gu¨ntherodt , 1990 ) showed quasiatomic reso - lution on LiF ( 001 ) in ambient conditions . The AFM im - ages were explained with the ‘‘contact - hard - spheres model’’ by Meyer et al . ( Meyer , Heinzelmann , Brod - beck , et al . , 1990 ) , which assumes that the front atom of the tip and the sample atoms are hard spheres . Also in 1990 , G . Meyer and N . M . Amer ( 1990 ) published a pa - per about the successful imaging of NaCl in ultrahigh vacuum at room temperature with quasiatomic resolu - tion . Quasiatomic resolution means that the images re - ﬂect atomic periodicities , but no atomic defects . The im - ages appear to arise from a tip that has several or possibly many atomic contacts ( minitips ) spaced by one or several surface lattice vectors . This hypothesis is sup - ported by the common observation in contact atomic force microscopy that the resolution appears to improve after the tip is scanned for a while . Wear can cause the tip to develop a set of minitips which are spaced by mul - tiple sample surface lattice vectors , yielding a quasi - atomic resolution . This mechanism is not observed and not expected to occur in today’s noncontact AFM ex - periments . In both contact AFM experiments ( E . Meyer et al . and G . Meyer et al . ) , only one type of ion was apparent in the force microscope images . In 1990 , we improved our 4 - K ultrahigh - vacuum instrument by mounting the whole vacuum system on air legs and adding a vibration insulation stage directly at the microscope . The major experimental challenge was the detection of the cantile - ver deﬂection . As in the ﬁrst AFM by Binnig ( 1986 ) , tunneling detection was used to measure the deﬂection of a micromachined V - shaped cantilever with a spring constant of k " 0 . 37 N / m , made by Albrecht et al . ( 1990 ) . The cantilever was made from SiO 2 and plated with a thin gold ﬁlm for electrical conductance . The tunneling tip had to be adjusted to an area of a few . m 2 before the microscope was inserted into the low - temperature vacuum system . As it turned out later , successful tunnel - ing between the platinum - coated tungsten tip and the gold - plated cantilever was only possible if the tip had 961 Franz J . Giessibl : Advances in atomic force microscopy Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 75 , No . 3 , July 2003 drifted towards the ﬁxed end of the cantilever beam dur - ing cooling of the instrument from room temperature to 4 K . When the tunneling tip was adjacent to the free end of the cantilever , a jump - to - contact between tunneling tip and cantilever occurred and stable tunneling condi - tions were hard to achieve . However , if the tunneling tip met the cantilever at a distance L tunneling from the ﬁxed end of the cantilever with total length L , the effective stiffness of the cantilever increased by a factor of ( L / L tunneling ) 3 [ see Eq . ( 14 ) ] and a jump - to - contact was less likely to occur . Endurance was critical , because only in one of about ten cooling cycles did all parts of the complicated microscope work . KBr ( cleaved in situ ) was used as a sample . After the sample was approached to the cantilever , jump - to - contact occurred and the sample area where the cantilever had landed was destroyed . Af - ter jump - to - contact occurred , the pressure on the tip re - gion was released by pulling back the sample , so that the cantilever still stayed in contact with the sample , but the repulsive force between the front atom of the cantilever and the sample was reduced to ! 1 nN . With the re - duced tip - sample force , the sample was moved laterally to an undisturbed area , and atomic resolution was im - mediately obtained . In summer of 1991 , we ﬁnally succeeded in obtaining true atomic resolution on KBr . Figure 19 shows the KBr ( 001 ) surface imaged in contact mode . Both ionic species are visible , because repulsive forces are used for imag - ing . The small bumps are interpreted as K $ ions and the large bumps as Br # ions . Today even with reﬁned non - contact AFM , only one atomic species appears as a pro - trusion in images of ionic crystals . Most likely , the domi - nant interaction between front atom and sample in noncontact AFM is electrostatic , so the charge of the front atom determines whether cations or anions appear as protrusions ; see , for example , Livshits , Shluger , and Rohl ( 1999 ) , Livshits et al . ( 1999 ) , and Shluger et al . ( 1999 ) . Figure 20 shows atomic resolution on KBr with linear singularities and atomic defects . This image was ob - tained by scanning an area of 5 ! 5 nm 2 for awhile and then doubling the scan size to 10 ! 10 nm 2 . The fast - scanning direction was horizontal , the slow - scanning di - rection vertical from bottom to top . In the lower section in Fig . 20 ( region 1 ) the scan size was 5 ! 5 nm 2 . Region 2 is a transition area , where the x - and y - scan widths were continuously increased to 10 nm ( an analog scan electronics was used where the widths of both scanning axes were independently controlled by a potentiometer in real time ) . In region 3 , the scan size was set at 10 ! 10 nm 2 . Initially , we interpreted the singularity as a monoatomic step ( Binnig , 1992 ) . However , the height difference between the central area in Fig . 20 and the surrounding area is much smaller than a single step ( 3 . 3 Å ) . Therefore today it appears that the central area is a ‘‘scan window , ’’ i . e . , a region slightly damaged by the pressure of the scanning cantilever . Even scanning at very small loads of a nN or so disturbed the surface slightly and created a depressed area with a ) ! ) R 45° superstructure on the KBr surface . The pres - ence of atomic defects ( arrows in Fig . 20 ) , linear defects , and superstructures strengthened our conﬁdence in the true atomic resolution capability of the AFM . However , the experimental difﬁculties with low - temperature op - eration , sample preparation , tunneling detection , etc . made it quite impractical for routine measurements . In 1993 , Ohnesorge and Binnig ( 1993 ) pursued a dif - ferent method for canceling the damaging long - range forces . The long - range attractive forces which cause jump - to - contact were reduced by immersing the cantile - ver and sample in a liquid , as explained by Israelachvili ( 1991 ) . Ohnesorge and Binnig ( 1993 ) achieved true atomic resolution by atomic force microscopy across FIG . 19 . ( Color in online edition ) Atomically resolved image of KBr ( 001 ) in contact AFM mode .

Giessibl : Advances in atomic force microscopy Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 75 , No . 3 , July 2003 steps on calcite in repulsive and attractive mode . True atomic resolution of inert surfaces by AFM had thus been clearly established . However , the enigmatic icon of atomic - resolution microscopy , Si ( 111 ) - ( 7 ! 7 ) , re - mained an unsolved challenge . Even experts in experi - mental atomic force microscopy were convinced that this goal was impossible to reach because of silicon’s high reactivity and the strong bonds that are formed be - tween cantilever tips and the Si surface . V . THE RUSH FOR SILICON Imaging the Si ( 111 ) - ( 7 ! 7 ) reconstruction was cru - cial for the success of the STM , and therefore imaging silicon by AFM with atomic resolution was a goal for many AFM researchers . However , so far atomic resolu - tion had not been obtained on reactive surfaces . The ions in alkali - halides form more or less closed noble - gas shells and are therefore inert . In contrast , silicon is known to form strong covalent bonds with a cohesive energy of roughly 2 eV per bond . The jump - to - contact problem outlined in Sec . III . A is even more severe for silicon , and using silicon cantilevers on silicon samples in contact mode , in vacuum , had been proven not to work . At Park Scientiﬁc Instruments , the frequency - modulation technique pioneered by Albrecht et al . ( 1991 ) was used at that time in ambient conditions , and it was tempting to incorporate the technique into our newly designed ultrahigh - vacuum microscope ( the ‘‘Au - toProbe VP’’ ) . Marco Tortonese had developed piezore - sistive cantilevers during his time as a graduate student in Cal Quate’s group in Stanford and made them avail - able to us . In vacuum , the piezoresistive cantilevers had excellent Q values and were thus predestined for use in the FM mode . In late 1993 , Giessibl and Trafas ( 1994 ) observed single steps and kinks on KBr using the FM method ( see Fig . 21 ) . Also in 1993 , Giessibl ( 1994 ) ob - served atomic rows on Si ( 111 ) - ( 7 ! 7 ) , and in May 1994 ( Giessibl , 1995 ) , the ﬁrst clear images of the 7 ! 7 pattern appeared ( see Fig . 22 ) . A different route had been pursued by the group of H . - J . Gu¨ntherodt : Howald , Lu¨thi , Meyer , Gu¨thner , and Gu¨therodt ( 1994 ) coated the tip of the cantilever with PTFE ( poly - tetra - ﬂuoro - ethylen ) and found that atomic steps and even the Si ( 111 ) 7 ! 7 unit cell periodicity could be imaged in contact mode in vacuum ( see Fig . 23 ) . Erlandsson et al . ( 1997 ) showed that atomic resolu - tion on Si ( 111 ) 7 ! 7 is also possible with the amplitude - modulation technique ( see Fig . 24 ) . VI . FREQUENCY - MODULATION ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPY A . Experimental setup In FM - AFM , a cantilever with eigenfrequency f 0 and spring constant k is subject to controlled positive feed - back such that it oscillates with a constant amplitude A ( Albrecht et al . , 1991 ; Du¨rig et al . , 1992 ) as shown in Fig . 25 . The deﬂection signal ﬁrst enters a bandpass ﬁlter . Then the signal splits into three branches : one branch is phase shifted , routed through an analog multiplier , and fed back to the cantilever via an actuator ; one branch is used to compute the actual oscillation amplitude—this signal is used to calculate a gain input g for the analog multiplier ; and one branch is used to feed a frequency detector . The frequency f is determined by the eigenfre - quency f 0 of the cantilever and the phase shift ? be - tween the mechanical excitation generated at the actua - tor and the deﬂection of the cantilever . If ? " 7 / 2 , the loop oscillates at f " f 0 . Forces between tip and sample cause a change in f " f 0 $ < f . The eigenfrequency of a harmonic oscillator is given by ( k * / m * ) 0 . 5 / ( 2 7 ) , where k * is the effective spring constant and m * is the effective mass . If the sec - ond derivative of the tip - sample potential k ts " - 2 V ts / - z 2 is constant for the whole range covered by the oscillating cantilever , k * " k $ k ts . If k ts ’ k , the FIG . 21 .

Phys . , Vol . 75 , No . 3 , July 2003 square root can be expanded as a Taylor series and the shift in eigenfrequency is approximately given by < f " k ts 2 k f 0 . ( 21 ) The case in which k ts is not constant is treated in the next section . By measuring the frequency shift < f , one can determine the tip - sample force gradient . The oscillator circuit is a critical component in FM - AFM . The function of this device is understood best by analyzing the cantilever motion . The cantilever can be treated as a damped harmonic oscillator that is exter - nally driven . For sinusoidal excitations A dri v e e i 2 7 f dri v e t and a quality factor Q ( 1 , the response of the oscillation amplitude of the cantilever is given by A A dri v e " 1 1 # f dri v e 2 / f 02 $ if dri v e / # f 0 Q $ . ( 22 ) The absolute value of the amplitude is given by ! A ! " ! A dri v e ! ! # 1 # f dri v e 2 / f 02 $ 2 $ f dri v e 2 / # f 02 Q 2 $ ( 23 ) and the phase angle between the driving and resulting signals is ? " arctan # f dri v e Qf 0 # 1 # f dri v e 2 / f 02 $ $ . ( 24 ) In the case of a closed feedback loop like that shown in Fig . 25 , the driving frequency can no longer be chosen freely but is determined by f 0 of the cantilever , the phase shift ? , and the tip - sample forces . The purpose of the oscillator circuit is to provide controlled positive feedback ( with a phase angle of ? " 7 / 2 ) such that the cantilever oscillates at a constant amplitude . This re - quirement is fulﬁlled with the setup shown in Fig . 25 . The cantilever deﬂection signal is ﬁrst routed through a bandpass ﬁlter which cuts off the noise from unwanted frequency bands . The ﬁltered deﬂection signal branches into an rms - to - dc converter and a phase shifter ( see Horowitz and Hill , 1989 ) . The rms - to - dc chip computes a dc signal that corresponds to the rms value of the am - plitude . This signal is added to the inverted setpoint rms amplitude , yielding the amplitude error signal . The am - plitude error enters a proportional ( P ) and optional in - tegral ( I ) controller , and the resulting signal g is multi - FIG . 23 .

The phase shifter is adjusted so that the driving signal required for establishing the desired oscillation amplitude is minimal ; ? is exactly 7 / 2 in this case . Du¨rig et al . ( 1992 ) and Gauthier et al . ( Gauthier , Sasaki , and Tsukuda ; 2001 ; Gauthier , Perez , et al . , 2002 ) have ana - lyzed the stability issues related to this forced motion . The ﬁltered cantilever deﬂection signal is fed into a frequency - to - voltage converter . Initially , analog circuits were used as frequency - to - voltage converters ( Albrecht et al . , 1991 ) . Recently , commercial digital phase - locked - loop ( PLL ) detectors made by Nanosurf , 2 and analog quartz - stabilized PLL’s ( Kobayashi et al . , 2001 ) became available which are more precise and more convenient . The PLL allows one to set a reference frequency f ref and outputs a signal that is proportional to the difference between the input frequency f and the reference fre - quency f ref . This signal < f " f # f ref is used as the imag - ing signal in FM - AFM . Some researchers use the PLL’s oscillator signal to drive the cantilever . The advantage is the greater spectral cleanliness of the PLL oscillator sig - nal . A disadvantage is that the cantilever drive loop be - comes more convoluted , and once the PLL is out of lock , the oscillation of the cantilever stops . B . Experimental parameters While it was believed initially that the net force be - tween the front atom of the tip and the sample had to be attractive when atomic resolution was desired , theoreti - cal ( Sokolov et al . , 1999 ; Jarvis et al . , 2001 ) and experi - mental evidence ( Giessibl , Bielefeldt , et al . , 2001 ; Giessibl , Hembacher , et al . , 2001b ) suggests that atomic resolution even on highly reactive samples is possible with repulsive forces . Nevertheless , the dynamic modes are commonly still called ‘‘noncontact’’ modes . For atomic studies in vacuum , the FM mode is now the pre - ferred AFM technique . FM - AFM was introduced by Albrecht , Grutter , Horne , and Rugar ( 1991 ) in magnetic force microscopy . In these experiments , Albrecht et al . imaged a thin - ﬁlm CoPtCr magnetic recording disk [ Fig . 7 ( a ) in Albrecht et al . ( 1991 ) ] with a cantilever that had a spring constant k ! 10 N / m , eigenfrequency f 0 " 68 485 Hz , amplitude A " 5 nm , Q value of 40 000 ( Albrecht , 2000 ) , and a tip with a thin magnetic ﬁlm coverage . The noise level and imaging speed were improved signiﬁcantly over those obtained by amplitude - modulation techniques . In 1993 , the frequency - modulation method was implemented in the prototype of a commercial STM / AFM for ultrahigh vacuum ( Giessibl and Trafas , 1994 ) . Initial experiments on KCl yielded excellent resolution and , soon after , the Si ( 111 ) - ( 7 ! 7 ) surface was imaged with true atomic resolution for the ﬁrst time ( Giessibl , 1995 ) . FM - AFM has ﬁve operating parameters : ( 1 ) The spring constant of the cantilever k . ( 2 ) The eigenfrequency of the cantilever f 0 . ( 3 ) The quality factor value of the cantilever Q . ( 4 ) The oscillation amplitude A . ( 5 ) The frequency shift of the cantilever < f . The ﬁrst three parameters are determined by the type of cantilever that is used , while the last two parameters can be freely adjusted . The initial parameters which provided true atomic resolution ( k " 17 N / m , f 0 " 114 kHz , Q " 28 000 , A " 34 nm , < f " # 70 Hz ) were found empirically . Surprisingly , the amplitude necessary for obtaining good results was very large compared to atomic dimensions . The necessity of using large ampli - tudes for obtaining good results seems counterintuitive , because the tip of the cantilever spends only a small fraction of an oscillation cycle in close vicinity to the sample . In hindsight , it appears that the large amplitudes were required to prevent instabilities of the cantilever oscillation ( see Sec . III . A ) . Apparently , the product be - tween spring constant and amplitude ( column ‘‘ kA 1 nN 3 ’’ in Table I ) has to be larger than ! 100 nN to provide a sufﬁciently strong withdrawing force . In the experiments conducted in 1994 ( see rows 1 and 2 in Table I ) , this condition was not met , and correspond - ingly , the resolution was not yet quite atomic . An addi - tional lower - threshold condition for A was proposed : E " 12 kA 2 ( column ‘‘ E 1 keV 3 ’’ in Table I ) should be large compared to < E ts deﬁned in Eq . ( 44 ) . This condi - tion is required for maintaining stable oscillation ampli - tudes , as shown below . As shown in Table I , atomic reso - lution on silicon and other samples was reproduced by other groups with similar operating parameters , < f ! # 100 Hz , k ! 20 N / m , f 0 ! 200 kHz , and A ! 10 nm . 2 These are the easyPLL Digital FM Detectors made by Nanosurf AG , Liestal , Switzerland CH - 8804 .

Phys . , Vol . 75 , No . 3 , July 2003 Several commercial vendors now offer frequency - modulated AFM’s that operate with these parameters . 3 The use of high - Q cantilevers with a stiffness of k ! 20 N / m oscillating with an amplitude of A ! 10 nm has enabled many groups to routinely achieve atomic reso - lution by FM - AFM . As shown in Table I , this mode is used in many laboratories now , and we therefore call it the ‘‘classic’’ FM - AFM mode . While the operating pa - rameters of the classic FM - AFM mode provide good re - sults routinely , it was not proved initially that these pa - rameters yielded optimal resolution . The search space for ﬁnding the optimal parameters was not completely open , because micromachined cantilevers were only available with a limited selection of spring constants . A theoretical study later showed ( Giessibl , Bielefeldt , et al . , 1999 ) , that the optimal amplitudes are in the Å range , requiring spring constants of the order of a few hundred N / m , much stiffer than the spring constants of commercially available cantilevers . This result has been veriﬁed experimentally by achieving unprecedented resolution with a cantilever with k " 1800 N / m and sub - nm oscillation amplitudes ( Giessibl , Hembacher , et al . , 2000 ; Giessibl , Bielefeldt , et al . , 2001 ) . Eguchi and Hasegawa ( 2002 ) have also achieved extremely high resolution with a silicon cantilever with a stiffness of 46 . 0 N / m and an oscillation amplitude of only 2 . 8 nm . VII . PHYSICAL OBSERVABLES IN FM - AFM A . Frequency shift and conservative forces 1 . Generic calculation The oscillation frequency is the main observable in FM - AFM , and it is important to establish a connection between frequency shift and the forces acting between tip and sample . While the frequency can be calculated numerically ( Anczykowski et al . , 1996 ) , an analytic cal - culation is important for ﬁnding the functional relation - ships between operational parameters and the physical tip - sample forces . The motion of the cantilever ( spring constant k , effective mass m * ) can be described by a weakly disturbed harmonic oscillator . Figure 26 shows the deﬂection q ! ( t ) of the tip of the cantilever : it oscil - lates with an amplitude A at a distance q ( t ) from a sample . The closest point to the sample is q " d and q ( t ) " q ! ( t ) $ d $ A . The Hamiltonian of the cantilever is H " p 2 2 m * $ kq ! 2 2 $ V ts # q $ , ( 25 ) where p " m * dq ! / dt . The unperturbed motion is given by q ! # t $ " A cos # 2 7 f 0 t $ , ( 26 ) and the frequency is f 0 " 1 2 7 ! k m * . ( 27 ) If the force gradient k ts " # - F ts / - z is constant during the oscillation cycle , the calculation of the frequency shift is trivial : < f " f 0 k ts 2 k . ( 28 ) However , in classic FM - AFM k ts varies by orders of magnitude during one oscillation cycle , and a perturba - tion approach as shown below has to be employed for the calculation of the frequency shift . The ﬁrst derivation of the frequency shift in FM - AFM ( Giessibl , 1997 ) utilized canonical perturbation theory ( see , for example , Goldstein , 1980 ) . The result of this calculation was < f " # f 0 kA 2 + F ts q ! , , ( 29 ) where the brackets indicate averaging across one oscil - lation cycle . The applicability of ﬁrst - order perturbation theory de - pends on the magnitude of the perturbation , i . e . , on the ratio between V ts and the energy of the oscillating can - tilever E " H 0 . In FM - AFM , E is typically in the range of several keV’s ( see Table I ) , while V ts is only a few electron volts and ﬁrst - order perturbation theory yields results for < f with excellent precision . An alternate approach to the calculation of < f has been taken by Baratoff ( 1997 ) , Du¨rig ( 1999a , 1999b ) , and Livshits , Shluger , and Rohl ( 1999 ) . This approach also derives the magnitude of the higher harmonics and the constant deﬂection of the cantilever . The method involves solving Newton’s equation of motion for the cantilever ( effective mass . * , spring constant k ) : . * d 2 q ! dt 2 " # kq ! $ F ts # q ! $ .

The results of these calculations are also applicable for amplitude - modulation atomic force microscopy ( Bielefeldt and Giessibl , 1999 ) . Ho¨lscher , Allers , et al . ( 1999 ) have also used a canonical perturbation - theory approach and extended it to show that the frequency shift as a function of amplitude for inverse power forces can be expressed as a rational function for all ampli - tudes , not just in the large - amplitude limit . Sasaki and Tsukada have obtained a similar result to Eq . ( 29 ) with a different type of perturbation theory ( Sasaki and Tsukada , 1998 , 1999 ; Tsukada et al . , 2002 ) . 2 . An intuitive expression for frequency shifts as a function of amplitude For small amplitudes , the frequency shift is a very simple function of the tip - sample forces—it is propor - tional to the tip - sample force gradient k ts . For large am - plitudes , the frequency shift is given by the rather com - plicated equations ( 29 ) and ( 35 ) . With integration by parts , these complicated formulas transform into a very simple expression that resembles Eq . ( 28 ) ( Giessibl , 2001 ) : < f # z $ " f 0 + k ts # z $ , 2 k ( 36 ) with + k ts # z $ , " 1 7 2 A 2 ’ # A A k ts # z # q ! $ ! A 2 # q ! 2 dq ! . ( 37 ) This expression is closely related to Eq . ( 28 ) : the con - stant k ts of Eq . ( 28 ) is replaced by a weighted average + k ts , , where the weight function w ( q ! , A ) is a semicircle with radius A divided by the area of the semicircle B " 7 A 2 / 2 ( see Fig . 27 ) . For A & 0 , the semicircular weight function with its normalization factor 2 / 7 A 2 is a repre - sentation of Dirac’s delta function . Figure 28 shows the convolution with the proper normalization factor , and it is immediately apparent from this ﬁgure how the use of small amplitudes increases the weight of the short - range atomic forces over the unwanted long - range forces . The amplitude in FM - AFM allows one to tune the sensitivity of the AFM to forces of various ranges . 3 . Frequency shift for a typical tip - sample force The interaction of the macroscopic tip of an AFM with a sample is a complicated many - body problem , and F ts cannot be described by a simple function . However , quite realistic model forces can be constructed from lin - ear combinations of the following basic types : ( a ) inverse - power forces , ( b ) power forces , and ( c ) exponen - tial forces . Analytic expressions for the frequency shift as a function of tip - sample distance z and amplitude A are listed in Giessibl and Bielefeldt ( 2000 ) . A typical tip - sample force is composed of long - range contribu - tions and short - range contributions . This force can be approximated by a long - range van der Waals component and a short - range Morse - type interaction : F ts # z $ " C z $ / $ 2 % E bond # # e # % ( z # / ) $ e # 2 % ( z # / ) $ . ( 38 ) FIG . 27 . Calculation of the frequency shift < f : < f is a convo - lution of a semispherical weight function with the tip - sample force gradient . The radius A of the weight function is equal to the oscillation amplitude of the cantilever . The weight function w is plotted in arbitrary units in this scheme— w has to be divided by 7 A 2 / 2 for normalization ( see Fig . 28 ) . 967 Franz J . Giessibl : Advances in atomic force microscopy Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 75 , No . 3 , July 2003 Here C depends on the tip angle and the Hamaker con - stant of tip and sample , and E bond , / , and % are the bonding energy , equilibrium distance , and decay length of the Morse potential , respectively . With the results de - rived in Giessibl and Bielefeldt ( 2000 ) , the resulting fre - quency shift is < f # z , A $ " f 0 kA C z $ / % F 11 , 1 / 2 # # 2 A z $ / $ # F 21 , 3 / 2 # # 2 A z $ / $ & # f 0 2 % E bond kA C e # % z 1 M 11 / 2 # # 2 % A $ # M 23 / 2 # # 2 % A $ 3 $ e # 2 % z 1 M 11 / 2 # # 4 % A $ # M 23 / 2 # # 4 % A $ 3 D , ( 39 ) where F ca , b ( z ) is the hypergeometric function and M ba ( z ) is Kummer’s function ( Abramowitz and Stegun , 1970 ) . Equation ( 39 ) describes the frequency shift as a func - tion of amplitude and tip - sample distance . For small am - plitudes , the frequency shift is independent of the ampli - tude and proportional to the tip - sample force gradient k ts [ Eq . ( 28 ) ] . For amplitudes that are large compared to the range of the tip - sample force , the frequency shift is a function of the amplitude , < f 0 A # 1 . 5 . If amplitudes larger than the range of the relevant forces are used , it is helpful to introduce a ‘‘normalized frequency shift’’ 5 deﬁned by 5 # z , A $ ª kA 3 / 2 f 0 < f # z , A $ . ( 40 ) For large amplitudes , 5 ( z , A ) asymptotically approaches a constant value ( see Fig . 2 in Giessibl and Bielefeldt , 2000 ) , i . e . , lim A → A 5 ( z , A ) * 5 lA ( z ) . The normalized fre - quency shift is calculated from the tip - sample force with 5 lA # z $ " 1 & 7 ’ 0 A F ts # z $ z ! $ ! z ! dz ! . ( 41 ) The normalized frequency shift helps to characterize AFM experiments and has a similar role as the tunneling impedance in scanning tunneling microscopy on metals . Ho¨lscher et al . ( 2000 ) have performed frequency - shift versus distance measurements with a silicon cantilever on a graphite surface , with amplitudes ranging from 54 to 180 Å , and veriﬁed the concept of the normalized frequency shift 5 " < f ! k ! A 3 / 2 / f 0 as the pertinent imag - ing parameter in classic FM - AFM ( see Fig . 29 ) . Five frequency - shift curves taken with amplitudes ranging from 54 to 180 Å match precisely when rescaled using the normalized frequency shift . Thus for small ampli - tudes the frequency shift is very sensitive to short - range forces , because short - range forces have a very strong force gradient , while for large amplitudes , long - range forces contribute heavily to the frequency shift . Figure 30 shows the tip - sample force deﬁned in Eq . ( 38 ) and the corresponding force gradient and normalized fre - quency shift 5 lA . The parameters for the short - range interaction are adopted from Perez et al . ( 1998 ) : % " 12 . 76 nm # 1 , E bond " 2 . 273 eV , and / " 2 . 357 Å . The FIG . 28 . Calculation of the frequency shift < f : < f is a convo - lution of a weight function w with the tip - sample force gradi - ent . For small amplitudes , short - range interactions contribute heavily to the frequency shift , while long - range interactions are attenuated . However , for large amplitudes the long - range interactions cause the main part of the frequency shift , and short - range interactions play a minor role . FIG . 29 . ( Color in online edition ) Experimental normalized frequency - shift versus distance data , acquired with a low - temperature ultrahigh - vacuum AFM with a graphite sample surface and a silicon cantilever . The average distance between the center of the tip’s front atom and the plane deﬁned by the centers of the surface atom layer is d , thus the minimal tip - sample distance is d # A . Five experimental frequency - shift versus distance data sets with amplitudes from 54 to 180 Å are expressed in the normalized frequency shift 5 " kA 3 / 2 < f / f 0 . The ﬁve experimental data sets match exactly , proving the va - lidity of the concept of a normalized frequency shift . The black curve is a simulated 5 ( d # A ) curve using a Lennard - Jones short - range force and a 1 / ( d # A ) long - range force . In the re - pulsive regime , the deviation between the experimental dots and the simulated curve is substantial , because the 1 / ( d # A ) 12 dependence of the repulsive Lennard - Jones potential describes only the interaction of the tip and sample atom . The sample atom is embedded in a lattice with ﬁnite stiffness ; graphite , the sample surface material , is a very soft material . Hertzian contact theory ( see , for example , Chen , 1993 ) is an appropriate model when the repulsive forces are large enough to cause overall sample deformations . From Ho¨lscher et al . , 2000 . 968 Franz J . Giessibl : Advances in atomic force microscopy Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 75 , No . 3 , July 2003 force gradient is vanishing for z & 6 Å , while the normal - ized frequency shift for large amplitudes reaches almost half its maximum at this distance . The dependence of the frequency shift on amplitude shows that small am - plitudes increase the sensitivity to short - range forces ! The ability to adjust the amplitude in FM - AFM compares to tuning an optical spectrometer to a passing wavelength . When short - range interactions are to be probed , the am - plitude should be in the range of the short - range forces . While using amplitudes in the Å range has been prob - lematic with conventional cantilevers because of the in - stability problem described in Sec . III . A , stiff sensors such as the qPlus sensor displayed in Fig . 11 are well suited for small - amplitude operation . 4 . Deconvolution of forces from frequency shifts Frequency shifts can be measured with high accuracy and low noise , while the measurement of dc forces is subject to large noise . However , forces and not fre - quency shifts are of primary physical interest . A number of methods have been proposed to derive forces from the frequency shift curves . The ﬁrst type of method requires the relation of fre - quency shift versus distance < f ( z ) over the region of interest . Because force and frequency shift are con - nected through a convolution , a deconvolution scheme is needed to connect forces ( or force gradients ) to the frequency shift and vice versa . Giessibl ( 1997 ) has pro - posed constructing a model force composed from basic functions ( inverse power and exponential forces ) and ﬁt - ting the parameters ( range and strength ) of the model force so that its corresponding frequency shift matches the experimental frequency shift . Gotsmann et al . ( 1999 ) have proposed a numerical algorithm , and Du ¨ rig ( 1999b ) has developed an iterative scheme for force de - convolution . Giessibl ( 2001 ) has proposed a simple and intuitive matrix method to deconvolute forces from fre - quency shifts . The second type of spectroscopy method requires a knowledge of the frequency as a function of cantilever amplitude < f ( A ) . Ho¨lscher , Allers , et al . ( 1999 ) and Ho¨lscher ( 2002 ) have modiﬁed the method elucidated in Sec . 12 of Landau’s textbook on classical mechanics ( Landau and Lifshitz , 1990 , 13th ed . ) to recover the in - teraction potential from the dependence of the oscilla - tion period T " 1 / f on energy E " kA 2 / 2 . For the third approach , developed by Du¨rig ( 2000 ) , the full tip - sample potential curve can be recovered within the z interval covered by the cantilever motion if the amplitudes and phases of all the higher harmonics of the cantilever motion are known . This method is very elegant because , in principle , the higher harmonics can be measured in real time , which eliminates the need to take time - consuming < f ( z ) or < f ( A ) spectra . Du¨rig’s method is particularly promising for small - amplitude op - erations , because already the ﬁrst few harmonics at 2 f , 3 f , . . . contain characteristic information about the tip - sample potential . B . Average tunneling current for oscillating tips When the tip of the cantilever and the sample are both conductive , simultaneous STM and FM - AFM op - eration is possible , i . e . , the tunneling current I t as well as the frequency shift can be recorded while scanning the surface . In most cases , the bandwidth of the tunneling current preampliﬁer is much smaller than the oscillation frequency f 0 of typical cantilevers . The measured tun - neling current is given by the time - average over one os - cillation cycle . With the exponential distance depen - dence I t ( z ) " I 0 e # 2 % t z [ see Eq . ( 1 ) ] we ﬁnd + I t # z , A $ , " I 0 e # 2 % t z M 11 / 2 # # 4 % t A $ , ( 42 ) where M ba ( E ) is the Kummer function ( Abramowitz and Stegun , 1970 ) . When % t A ( 1 , + I t # z , A $ , ! I t # z , 0 $ / ! 4 7 % t A . ( 43 ) Figure 31 shows the tunneling current as a function of the product between % t and A . For A " 5 nm and % t " 1 Å # 1 , the average tunneling current is ! 1 / 25 of the value when the cantilever does not oscillate . Because the noise of the current measurement decreases with an in - FIG . 30 . Force F ts ( z ) , force gradient k ts ( z ) , and large - amplitude normalized frequency shift 5 lA ( z ) for the tip - sample force deﬁned in Eq . ( 38 ) . When the cantilever’s oscil - lation amplitude A is small compared to the range of the tip - sample forces 4 , the frequency shift is proportional to the force gradient , while for A ( 4 , the frequency shift is proportional to 5 lA ( z ) .

Phys . , Vol . 75 , No . 3 , July 2003 creasing average tunneling current , the use of small am - plitudes improves the quality of simultaneous STM and FM - AFM measurements . It should be noted that Eq . ( 43 ) is an upper threshold . When using large amplitudes ( % t A ( 1 ) , the tunneling current vs time is a series of Gaussian functions spaced by 1 / f where f is the oscillation frequency of the canti - lever . Especially when using cantilevers with large eigen - frequencies , the tunneling current varies very rapidly with time . Because of slew - rate and bandwidth limita - tions , typical tunneling preampliﬁers are unable to con - vert these rapid current variations in output voltage swings . Thus the experimental average current can be - come even smaller than that given by Eq . ( 43 ) . C . Damping and dissipative forces Conservative tip - sample forces cause a frequency shift . A nonconservative component in the tip - sample force , that is , a hysteresis in the force - versus - distance graph < E ts # x ! $ " ( F F ! ts # x ! $ x ! ! $ dx ! ! , ( 44 ) where F is the trajectory of the oscillating cantilever , causes energy loss in the motion of the cantilever . This energy loss is measurable . The cantilever itself already dissipates energy ( internal dissipation ) . When the tip of the cantilever is far from the sample , the damping of the cantilever is due to internal dissipation and the energy loss per oscillation cycle is given by < E CL " 2 7 E Q , ( 45 ) where E " kA 2 / 2 is the energy of the cantilever and Q is its quality factor . When the phase angle between the excursion of the actuator and the excursion of the can - tilever is exactly ? " 7 / 2 , the cantilever oscillates at fre - quency f 0 and the driving signal is A dri v e " Ae i 7 / 2 / Q . Hence the driving amplitude and dissipation are con - nected : ! A dri v e ! " ! A ! < E CL 2 7 E . ( 46 ) When the tip oscillates close to the sample , additional damping occurs and the driving signal A dri v e is increased by the oscillator control electronics to A dri v e ! in order to maintain a constant amplitude A where ! A dri v e ! ! " ! A ! < E CL $ < E ts 2 7 E " ! A ! # 1 Q $ < E ts 2 7 E $ . ( 47 ) Equation ( 47 ) has an important implication for the op - timal Q factor of the cantilever . While a high Q factor results in low - frequency noise [ see Eq . ( 50 ) below ] , Eq . ( 47 ) shows that the Q value of the cantilever should not be much higher than the ratio 2 7 E / < E ts . If Q is much higher than this value , it is difﬁcult for the oscillator circuit to maintain a constant amplitude , because small changes in < E ts require a major correction in the con - trol output g . Measurement of the damping signal yields the dissipa - tion in the approach and retract phases of the oscillating tip , where < E ts " 2 7 E Q # ! A dri v e ! ! ! A dri v e ! # 1 $ . ( 48 ) The ratio ! A dri v e ! ! / ! A dri v e ! is easily accessible in the dc input ( g ) of the analog multiplier chip shown in Fig . 25—an increase in the tip - sample dissipation < E ts is re - ﬂected in an increased gain signal g ! in the oscillator electronics and g ! / g " ! A dri v e ! ! / ! A dri v e ! . Several authors have recorded this signal simultaneously with the fre - quency shift and thus measured both elastic and non - elastic interaction forces simultaneously . See , for ex - ample , Bammerlin et al . ( 1997 ) ; Luthi et al . ( 1997 ) ; Ueyama et al . ( 1998 ) ; Hug and Baratoff ( 2002 ) . Physical origins of dissipation are discussed by Ab - durixit et al . ( 1999 ) ; Du¨rig ( 1999a ) ; Hoffmann , Jeffery , et al . ( 2001 ) ; Gauthier , Kantorovich , et al . ( 2002 ) ; Giessibl , Herz , and Mannhart ( 2002 ) ; and Hug and Baratoff ( 2002 ) . It should also be noted that dispersions in the oscilla - tor circuit and in the actuator assembly can lead to arti - facts in the interpretation of damping data , because ! A dri v e ! " ! A ! / Q only holds for f " f 0 . Anczykowski et al . ( 1999 ) have introduced a method that yields the correct dissipation energy even for cases in which the phase angle between actuator and cantilever is not ? " 7 / 2 . Mechanical resonances in the actuator assembly are likely to occur at the high resonance frequencies of con - ventional cantilevers . These resonances can cause sharp variations of the phase with frequency and thus create artifacts in the measurement of < E ts . A self - oscillation technique for cantilevers ( Giessibl and Tortonese , 1997 ) helps to avoid these resonances . VIII . NOISE IN FREQUENCY - MODULATION ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPY A . Generic calculation The vertical noise in FM - AFM can be calculated in the same fashion as in the STM case ( see Fig . 5 ) ; it is given by the ratio between the noise in the imaging sig - nal and the slope of the imaging signal with respect to z : ( z " ( < f " - < f - z " . ( 49 ) Figure 32 shows a typical frequency - shift - versus - distance curve . Because the distance between the tip and sample is measured indirectly through the frequency shift , it is clearly evident that the noise in the frequency measure - ment ( f " ( < f translates into vertical noise ( z and is given by the ratio between ( < f and the slope of the frequency shift curve < f ( z ) [ Eq . ( 49 ) ] . Low vertical 970 Franz J . Giessibl : Advances in atomic force microscopy Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 75 , No . 3 , July 2003 noise is obviously obtained for a low - noise frequency measurement and a steep slope of the frequency - shift curve . Additional boundary conditions apply : if the force between front atom and the surface is too large , the front atom or larger sections of tip or sample can shear off . It is interesting to note that in FM - AFM the noise will increase again upon further reducing the tip - sample distance when approaching the minimum of the < f ( z ) curve . Because the frequency shift is not mono - tonic with respect to z , stable feedback of the micro - scope is only possible either on the branch of < f with positive slope or on the one with negative slope . In FM - AFM with atomic resolution , the branch with positive slope is usually chosen . However , when using very small amplitudes , it is also possible to work on the branch with negative slope ( see Giessibl , Hembacher , et al . , 2001b ) . It is of practical importance to note that the minimum of the frequency - versus - distance curve shown in Fig . 32 is a function of the lateral tip position . Directly over a sample atom , the minimum can be very deep . However , at other sample sites there may be small negative fre - quency shift . Imaging can only be performed with frequency - shift setpoints that are reachable on every ( x , y ) position on the imaged sample area , otherwise a tip crash occurs . B . Noise in the frequency measurement Equation ( 49 ) shows that the accuracy of the frequency - shift measurement determines directly the vertical resolution in FM - AFM . What is the accuracy of the measurement of the oscillation frequency of the can - tilever ? Martin et al . ( 1987 ) and McClelland et al . ( 1987 ) have studied the inﬂuence of thermal noise on the can - tilever , and Albrecht et al . ( 1991 ) and Smith ( 1995 ) have calculated the thermal limit of the frequency noise . Leaving aside prefactors of the order of 7 , all these au - thors come to a similar conclusion , namely , that the square of the relative frequency noise is given by the ratio between the thermal energy of the cantilever ( k B T ) and the mechanical energy stored in it ( 0 . 5 kA 2 ) , divided by its quality factor Q and multiplied by the ratio between bandwidth B and cantilever eigenfre - quency f 0 . Speciﬁcally , Albrecht et al . ( 1991 ) ﬁnd ( f thermal f 0 " ! k B TB 7 kA 2 f 0 Q . ( 50 ) Albrecht et al . ( 1991 ) support Eq . ( 50 ) with measure - ments on the dependence of ( f 0 upon Q ( Fig . 5 in Al - brecht et al . , 1991 ) and A ( Fig . 6 in Albrecht et al . , 1991 ) and clearly state that Eq . ( 50 ) contains only the thermal cantilever noise and disregards the noise of the deﬂec - tion sensor . Correspondingly , the frequency noise be - comes larger than predicted by Eq . ( 50 ) for large Q val - ues in Fig . 5 of Albrecht et al . ( 1991 ) . These deviations are traced to interferometer noise , e . g . , noise in the can - tilever’s deﬂection sensor . Albrecht et al . ( 1991 ) do not provide measurements of ( f 0 as a function of bandwidth B . Equation ( 50 ) predicts a B 0 . 5 dependence . However , theoretical arguments by Du¨rig et al . ( 1997 ) and an analysis and measurements by Giessibl ( 2002 ) indicate a B 1 . 5 dependence of frequency noise . The following analysis shows the reasons for that . The frequency is given by the inverse of the time lag G between two consecutive zero crossings of the canti - lever with positive velocity . However , the deﬂection of the cantilever q ! is subject to a noise level ( q ! as shown in Fig . 33 . The deﬂection noise ( q ! has two major con - tributions : thermal excitation of the cantilever outside of its resonance frequency and instrumental noise in the measurement of the deﬂection q ! . The oscillation period G can only be measured with an rms accuracy ( G . The uncertainty of the time of the zero crossing is ( G / 2 , where ( G / 2 is given by the ratio between the cantilever deﬂection noise and the slope of the q ! ( t ) curve : ( G 2 " ( q ! 2 7 f 0 A . ( 51 ) Because f 0 " 1 / G , ( f 0 / f 0 " ( G / G and ( f detector f 0 " ( q ! 7 A . ( 52 ) Equation ( 52 ) applies only to frequency changes on a time scale of 1 / f 0 . When measuring frequency variations over a longer time scale , more zero crossings can be used to determine the frequency change , and the preci - sion of the frequency measurement increases . The out - FIG . 32 . Schematic plot of frequency shift < f as a function of tip - sample distance z . The noise in the tip - sample distance measurement is given by the noise of the frequency measure - ment < f divided by the slope of the frequency - shift curve . FIG . 33 . Typical cantilever deﬂection signal as it appears on an oscilloscope . The oscillation frequency is given by the inverse time lag between two consecutive zero crossings with positive velocity . 971 Franz J . Giessibl : Advances in atomic force microscopy Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 75 , No . 3 , July 2003 put of the frequency detector ( phase - locked - loop , see Fig . 25 ) typically has a low - pass ﬁlter with bandwidth B FM ’ f 0 ; thus the effective frequency noise is smaller than the value after Eq . ( 52 ) ( see Giessibl , 2002 ) . With ( q ! " n q ! ! B FM , we ﬁnd ( f detector " n q ! 7 A B FM 3 / 2 . ( 53 ) The scaling law ( f 0 B FM 3 / 2 was ﬁrst found by Du¨rig et al . ( 1997 ) . The frequency noise has two major contributors : ( a ) thermal noise of the cantilever and ( b ) detector noise . Because the two noise sources are statistically in - dependent , we ﬁnd ( Becker , 1969 ) ( f " ! ( f detector2 $ ( f thermal2 ( 54 ) with ( f thermal " ! k B TBf 0 / # 7 kA 2 Q $ . ( 55 ) The detector deﬂection noise density n q ! detector is deter - mined by the physical setup of the deﬂection sensor and describes the quality of the deﬂection sensor . For prac - tical purposes , it can be assumed to be constant for fre - quencies around f 0 . Good interferometers reach deﬂec - tion noise densities of 100 fm / ! Hz . For most setups , thermal noise is negligible compared to detector noise . In summary , the frequency noise is proportional to the deﬂection noise density times B 1 . 5 and inversely propor - tional to the amplitude . While Eq . ( 55 ) suggests the use of cantilevers with inﬁnitely high Q , Eq . ( 47 ) and the discussion after it imply that Q should not be signiﬁ - cantly larger than the ratio between the energy stored in the cantilever and the energy loss per oscillation cycle due to the tip - sample interaction . If Q is much higher than this value , controlling the amplitude of the cantile - ver can become difﬁcult , and instabilities are likely to occur . Frequency noise is discussed in greater depth and compared to experimental noise measurements by Giessibl ( 2002 ) . C . Optimal amplitude for minimal vertical noise Both the nominator and denominator in the generic FM - AFM noise [ Eq . ( 49 ) ] are functions of the amplitude—the frequency noise is proportional to 1 / A , the slope of the frequency shift curve is constant at ﬁrst and drops as A # 1 . 5 for large amplitudes . Thus there is minimal noise for amplitudes on the order of the range 4 of the tip sample force F ts ( Giessibl , Bielefeldt , et al . , 1999 ) : A optimal ! 4 . ( 56 ) Here , we calculate the vertical noise for a speciﬁc ex - ample . We consider a tip - sample interaction given by a Morse potential with a depth of # 2 . 15 eV , a decay length of % " 1 . 55 Å # 1 , and an equilibrium distance of / " 2 . 35 Å . As a cantilever , we consider a qPlus sensor as shown in Fig . 11 with k " 1800 N / m and n q ! " 100 fm / ! Hz , operated with B FM " 100 Hz . Figure 34 shows the vertical noise as a function of amplitude for a ﬁxed closest tip - sample distance of z min " 4 Å . Minimum noise occurs for log A / m " # 9 . 9 , i . e . , for A ! 1 . 26 Å , while for A " 340 Å the noise is about one order of mag - nitude larger . For chemical forces , 4 ! 1 Å . However , op - erating a conventional cantilever with amplitudes in the Å range close to a sample is impossible because of the jump - to - contact problem ( Sec . III . A ) . The cantilever spring constant k needs to be at least a few hundred N / m to enable operation with amplitudes in the Å range . IX . APPLICATIONS OF CLASSIC FREQUENCY - MODULATION ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPY A . Imaging Shortly after the ﬁrst demonstration of true atomic resolution of Si by AFM , Kitamura and Iwatsuki ( 1995 ) ; Gu¨thner ( 1996 ) ; Lu¨thi et al . ( 1996 ) ; and Nakagiri et al . ( 1997 ) succeeded in imaging Si with atomic resolution using FM - AFM with similar parameters . In November 1994 , Patrin ( 1995 ) succeeded in imaging KCl , an insu - lator with FM - AFM ( see Fig . 35 ) . Other semiconductors ( Sugawara et al . , 1995 ; Morita and Sugawara , 2002 ) , more ionic crystals ( Bammerlin et al . , 1997 ; Reichling and Barth , 1999 , 2002 ; Bennewitz , Bammerlin , and Meyer , 2002 ) , metal oxides ( Fukui et al . , 1997 ; Raza et al . , 1999 ; Barth and Reichling , 2002 ; Fukui and Iwasawa , 2002 ; Hosoi et al . , 2002 ; Pang and Thornton , 2002 ) , metals ( Loppacher et al . , 1998 ; Minobe et al . , 1999 ) , organic monolayers ( Gotsmann et al . , 1998 ; Ya - mada , 2002 ) , adsorbed molecules ( Sasahara and Onishi , 2002 ; Sugawara , 2002 ) , and even a ﬁlm of xenon phys - isorbed on graphite ( Allers et al . , 1998 ; see Fig . 36 ) were imaged with atomic resolution . FM - AFM can also be used for high - resolution Kelvin probe microscopy by studying the inﬂuence of electrostatic forces on the im - age ( Kitamura and Iwatsuki , 1998 ; Arai and Tomitori , 2002 ) . Classic frequency - modulation atomic force mi - croscopy provided a new tool to study problems that were not accessible by STM . Sugawara et al . ( 1995 ; see FIG . 34 .

In 2001 , Lantz et al . ( 2001 ) performed spectroscopy over speciﬁc atomic sites on the silicon surface . Figure 39 shows three distinct sites in the silicon 7 ! 7 unit cell , where frequency - shift data were collected . Figure 40 shows the corresponding frequency - shift data and the corresponding forces , calculated with the algorithm pro - posed by Du¨rig ( 1999b ) . This is a signiﬁcant break - through , because the measured forces are mainly caused by the interaction of two single atoms ( see also the per - spective by de Lozanne , 2001 ) . X . NEW DEVELOPMENTS A . Dissipation measurements and theory As early as 1991 , Denk and Pohl ( 1991 ) used FM - AFM to record the drive signal required to maintain a constant cantilever amplitude . In the distance regime covered by their early experiment , they found that the major dissipation mechanism is due to Ohmic losses of currents that are induced by the variable capacitance ( due to oscillation ) of the tip - sample assembly in con - nection with a constant tip - sample bias voltage . They obtained dissipation images on semiconductor hetero - structures with a feature size of some 10 nm and coined the term ‘‘scanning dissipation microscopy . ’’ Lu¨thi et al . ( 1997 ) recorded the damping signal in atomic resolution experiments on silicon . Today , a number of theories have been proposed to explain the energy loss in dy - namic atomic force microscopy ( Du ¨ rig , 1999a ; Gauthier and Tsukada , 1999 ; Sasaki and Tsukada , 2000 ; Kantorov - ich , 2001 ) . Recently , dissipative lateral forces have also been studied ; see Pfeiffer et al . ( 2002 ) and below . B . Off - resonance technique with small amplitudes Pethica early identiﬁed the problem of the long - range background forces and searched for a way to minimize them ( AFM challenge number 3 , Sec . III ) . In dynamic force microscopy , the contribution of various force com - ponents F i with a corresponding range 4 i to the imaging signal is a function of the cantilever oscillation ampli - tude A . For A ( 4 , the imaging signal is proportional to @ i F i ! 4 i , while for A ’ 4 , the imaging signal is propor - tional to @ i F i / 4 i ( see Sec . VII . A ) . Thus , for small am - plitudes , the imaging signal is proportional to the force gradient and the weight of short - range forces is much FIG . 39 . 6 nm ! 6 nm constant - frequency - shift image ( < f " # 38 Hz , rms error 1 . 15 Hz , scan speed 2 nm / s ) .

Phys . , Vol . 75 , No . 3 , July 2003 larger than the weight of long - range forces . This fact has been used in an off - resonance technique developed by Hoffmann , Oral , Grimble , O¨zer , Jeffrey , and Pethica ( 2001 ) . In this technique , a tungsten cantilever with k ! 300 N / m is oscillated at a frequency far below its reso - nance frequency with an amplitude A 0 of the order of 0 . 5 Å . When the cantilever comes close to the sample , the oscillation amplitude changes according to A " A 0 1 $ k ts / k ( 57 ) with a tip - sample stiffness k ts . Two other AFM chal - lenges , namely , the instability problem and the 1 / f noise problem , are also solved because of the stiff cantilever and the dynamic mode . Conceptually , this small - amplitude off - resonance technique is very attractive due to its simplicity in implementation and interpretation . A lock - in technique can be used to measure A , which im - proves the signal - to - noise ratio . The quality of the im - ages presented is so far not as good as the quality of classic or small - amplitude FM - AFM data , possibly be - cause the scanning speed is slow and thermal drift is a problem . Ongoing work has to show whether the image quality issues are due merely to technical imperfections or to more fundamental reasons . Atomic dissipation processes ( Hoffmann , Jeffery , et al . , 2001 ) and force - versus - distance data ( Oral et al . , 2001 ) have been mea - sured with the technique . C . Dynamic mode with stiff cantilevers and small amplitudes Intuitively , the amplitudes that are used in classic FM - AFM are much too large : if a silicon atom were magni - ﬁed to the size of an orange , the average distance of the cantilever used in classic noncontact AFM mode would amount to 15 m . The necessity of such large amplitudes was outlined in Sec . III . Intuitively , it was clear that greater sensitivity to short - range forces should be achieved with small amplitudes . It was even planned to use the thermal amplitude ( Giessibl , 1994 ) to enhance short - range force contributions . However , empirical ﬁndings showed that because of the stability issues out - lined above , large amplitudes had to be used with the relatively soft cantilevers that were available . Similar de - tours were taken in the development of the STM in sev - eral respects—the ﬁrst STM’s were insulated from exter - nal vibrations by levitation on superconducting magnets , and the ﬁrst STM tips were fabricated using complicated mechanical and chemical preparation techniques , while later STM’s used much simpler systems for vibration in - sulation and tip preparation ( see Binnig , 1997 , p . 59 ) . In FM - AFM , it was ﬁnally shown that small ampli - tudes do work , but only if extremely stiff cantilevers are used . After the theoretical proof of the beneﬁts of using small amplitudes with stiff cantilevers ( Giessibl et al . , 1999 ) , we tried to convince manufacturers of piezoresis - tive cantilevers to make devices with k ! 500 N / m—without success . However , the theoretical ﬁndings gave us enough conﬁdence to modify a quartz tuning fork to a quartz cantilever sensor with a stiffness of roughly 2 kN / m ( the qPlus sensor ; see Fig . 11 and Giessibl , 1996 , 1998 ) . Even the ﬁrst experiments were successful , yielding AFM images of silicon with excellent resolution . For the ﬁrst time , clear features within the image of a single atom were observed ( see Fig . 41 ) . The structure of these images was interpreted as originating from the orbitals of the tip atom , the ﬁrst observation of FIG . 41 . ( Color in online edition ) Image of a single adatom on Si ( 111 ) - ( 7 ! 7 ) . A 3 sp 3 state points towards the surface nor - mal on the Si ( 111 ) surface , and the image of this atom should be symmetric with respect to the z axis . Because images in an AFM are a convolution of tip and sample states , and the sample state is well known in this case , the tip state is most likely to be two 3 sp 3 states originating in a single Si tip atom ( see Giessibl , Hembacher et al . , 2000 ) .

Silicon adatoms display a single sp 3 dangling bond sticking out perpendicular from the surface . Thus the image of this atom is expected to be spherically symmetric with respect to the vertical axis . We interpret the image as being caused by an overlap of two sp 3 dangling bonds from the tip with the single dan - gling bond from the surface ; for a detailed description see Giessibl , Hembacher , et al . ( 2000 ) ; Giessibl , Bielefeldt , et al . ( 2001 ) . On the subatomic level , the im - age is sensitive to the chemical identity and the struc - tural surroundings of the front atom of the tip . First at - tempts to engineer tips with a known symmetry are under way ( Giessibl , Hembacher , et al . , 2001b ) . Figure 42 is an image of a Si ( 111 ) - ( 7 ! 7 ) surface imaged with a qPlus sensor with a [ 111 ] - oriented Si tip ( see Fig . 11 ) with extremely small amplitudes ( 2 . 5 Å ) and even posi - tive frequency shifts , i . e . , repulsive forces . The tip was found to be extremely stable compared to [ 001 ] - oriented tips . It should be noted that the claim of subatomic resolu - tion capability is under debate . Hug et al . ( 2001 ) pro - posed that the experimental observations of subatomic resolution could be artifacts due to feedback errors . However , Giessibl , Hembacher , et al . ( 2001a ) concluded that analysis of the feedback signals rules out feedback artifacts . So far , subatomic resolution has not been re - ported using classic noncontact AFM . The small - amplitude technique with very stiff cantilevers allows the achievement of tip - sample distances close to the bulk distances and obtains single - atom images with non - trivial internal structures ( subatomic resolution ) on sili - con ( Giessibl , Bielefeldt , et al . , 2001 ) and rare - earth metal atoms ( Herz et al . , 2003 ) . The enhanced resolution of short - range forces as a result of using small ampli - tudes was conﬁrmed experimentally by Eguchi and Ha - segawa ( 2002 ) . Furthermore , Huang , Cuma , and Liu ( 2003 ) have performed ab initio calculations and con - ﬁrmed that atomic substructures linked to atomic orbit - als are expected to occur when tip and sample reach distances similar to bulk next neighbor spacings . The capacity of the stiff - cantilever small - amplitude technique to image standard insulators with moderate short - range forces is shown in Fig . 43 , where a KCl [ 001 ] surface is imaged with a qPlus sensor with a silicon tip . D . Dynamic lateral force microscopy Experiments on atomic friction became possible with the invention of the lateral force microscope , introduced in 1987 by Mate et al . ( 1987 ) . The resolution power of the lateral force microscope has been improving steadily , opening many applications , including high - resolution wear studies on KBr ( Gnecco et al . , 2002 ) . However , the observation of single atomic defects has not been achieved by quasistatic lateral force microscopy . Be - cause of the similarity of the challenges faced by normal force and lateral force microscopy , the frequency - modulation method has been tried . Pfeiffer et al . ( 2002 ) imaged atomic steps with this technique , and recently Giessibl et al . ( 2002 ) achieved true atomic resolution with a large - stiffness , small - amplitude lateral frequency - modulated AFM ( see Fig . 12 ) . In addition to the fre - quency shift , the dissipated power between tip and sample was measured as the difference between the power required for maintaining a constant amplitude when the cantilever is close to the sample and the power FIG . 43 .

Figure 44 shows experimental data on the conservative and dis - sipative force components between a single adatom on a Si surface and a single atom tip . When the cantilever is vibrating laterally directly over an adatom , almost no extra dissipation occurs , while when approaching and re - tracting the tip from the side , a dissipation of the order of a few eV per oscillation cycle is measured . The data are interpreted with a theory going back to Tomlinson ( 1929 ) . XI . SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Imaging ﬂat surfaces with atomic resolution in direct space—regardless of their electrical conductivity—is standard practice now thanks to atomic force micros - copy . The theoretical understanding of AFM has been advanced considerably and a direct link between the ex - perimental observables ( frequency shift , damping , and average tunneling current ) and the underlying physical concepts ( conservative and dissipative forces ) has been established . Forces can be deconvoluted from frequency - shift data easily and low - temperature spec - troscopy experiments show an outstanding agreement between theoretical and experimental tip - sample forces . Atomic force microscopy yields information about the strength and geometry of chemical bonds between single atoms . Four techniques for atomic - resolution force micros - copy in vacuum are in use today : the classic frequency - modulation technique with large amplitudes and soft cantilevers ( used by most experimenters ) ; frequency modulation with small amplitudes and stiff cantilevers ; the off - resonance technique originated by the Pethica group ; and the amplitude - modulation method . The fu - ture will show if one of these techniques will survive as an optimal method or if all or some techniques will re - main in use . Lateral force microscopy with true atomic resolution has been demonstrated using the small - amplitude / stiff - cantilever technique . XII . OUTLOOK While FM atomic force microscopy is an established experimental technique , applications in the surface sci - ence of insulators are just starting to emerge . Atomic force microscopy is still more complicated than scanning tunneling microscopy , and these complications appear to deter many scientists . However , signiﬁcant progress has been made in recent years , and exciting results can be expected in the surface science of insulators , where the AFM is a unique tool for atomic studies in direct space . The possibilities of atomic - resolution force microscopy are overwhelming : access to the very scaffolding of mat - ter , the chemical bond . Progress in our physical under - standing and subsequent simpliﬁcation of the use and interpretation of AFM’s has been signiﬁcant over the past few years . Atomic force microscopy offers addi - tional observables—forces and damping—that are even vectors with three spatial components—the tunneling current in an STM is a scalar entity . There are strong indications that dynamic force microscopy allows the im - aging of features within single - atom images attributed to atomic valence orbitals . Thus the whole ﬁeld of classic STM studies could be revisited with the enhanced reso - lution technique . One of the greatest challenges of the AFM is the preparation of well - deﬁned tips . As in the early days of the STM , tip preparation has acquired a certain mys - tique , with recipes ranging from sputtering to controlled collisions . Because the tip is closer to the sample in the AFM than in the STM , the stability of the front atom is more important in the AFM . Also , the chemical identity and backbond geometry of the tip is crucial in an AFM . The use of nanotubes as tips appeared to be promising , but , the observations expressed in Fig . 4 of Binnig and Rohrer ( 1987 ) regarding the necessity of a rigid , cone - shaped tip are to be heeded , especially in the AFM , where forces between tip and sample are larger than in the STM . Atomic manipulation by scanning probe microscopes is an exciting challenge . Arranging atoms on conducting surfaces has been possible by use of the STM for a de - cade ( Eigler and Schweizer , 1990 ; Crommie et al . , 1993 ; Meyer et al . , 1996 ; Kliewer et al . , 2000 ; Manoharan et al . , 2000 ) . Morita and Sugawara ( 2002 ) have successfully ex - tracted single atoms from a Si ( 111 ) - ( 7 ! 7 ) surface in a controlled fashion with a force microscope . An exciting extension of this work would be possible if atoms could also be deposited with atomic precision by atomic force microscopy . The construction of one - dimensional con - ductors or semiconductors on insulating substrates would allow the building of electronic circuits consisting only of a few atoms . While it appears difﬁcult to ma - nipulate atoms with a probe that oscillates to and from the surface with amplitudes of the order of 10 nm , the continuous decrease in amplitudes used in dynamic force microscopy might allow us someday soon to move atoms in a controlled manner by atomic force micros - copy .
