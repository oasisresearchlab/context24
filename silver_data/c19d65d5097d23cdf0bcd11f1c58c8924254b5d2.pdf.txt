Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature Richard Rorty P hilosophy and the Mir - ror of Nature hit the philosophical world like a bombshell . Richard Rorty , a Princeton professor who had contributed to the an - alytic tradition in philoso - phy , was now attempting to shrug off all the cen - tral problems with which it had long been preoc - cupied . After publication , the Press was barely able to keep up with demand , and the book has since gone on to be - come one of its all - time best - sellers in philosophy . Rorty argued that , beginning in the seventeenth century , phi - losophers developed an unhealthy obsession with the notion of representation . They compared the mind to a mirror that reﬂects reality . In their view , knowledge is concerned with the accuracy of these reﬂections , and the strategy employed to obtain this knowl - edge—that of inspecting , repairing , and polishing the mirror— belongs to philosophy . Rorty’s book was a powerful critique of this imagery and the tradition of thought that it spawned . He ar - gued that the questions about truth posed by Descartes , Kant , Hegel , and modern epistemologists and philosophers of language simply couldn’t be answered and were , in any case , irrelevant to serious social and cultural inquiry . This stance provoked a bar - rage of criticism , but whatever the strengths of Rorty’s speciﬁc claims , the book had a therapeutic effect on philosophy . It reener - gized pragmatism as an intellectual force , steered philosophy back to its roots in the humanities , and helped to make alterna - tives to analytic philosophy a serious choice for young graduate students . Twenty - ﬁve years later , the book remains a must - read for anyone seriously concerned about the nature of philosophical inquiry and what philosophers can and cannot do to help us un - derstand and improve the world .   ( Click here to view our web site description . )
