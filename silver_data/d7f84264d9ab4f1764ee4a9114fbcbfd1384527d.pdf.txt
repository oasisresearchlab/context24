It is not well understood how the mechanobiological state of cells 17 is programmed by the interplay of intracellular organization and complex extracellular mechanics 18 when stimulated by cell volume modulation . Here , by controlling cell volume via osmotic 19 pressure , we evaluate physical phenotypes ( including cell shape , morphodynamics , traction force , 20 and extracellular matrix ( ECM ) remodeling ) and molecular signaling ( YAP ) , and we uncover 21 fundamental transitions in active biophysical states . We demonstrate that volumetric compression 22 shifts the ratiometric balance of Rho GTPase activities , thereby altering mechanosensing and 23 cytoskeletal organization in a reversible manner . Specifically , volumetric compression controls 24 cell spreading , adhesion formation , and YAP nuclear translocation , while maintaining cell 25 contractile activity . Furthermore , we show that on physiologically relevant fibrillar collagen I 26 matrices , which are highly non - elastic , cells exhibit additional modes of cell volume - dependent 27 mechanosensing that are not observable on elastic substrates . Notably , volumetric compression 28 regulates the dynamics of cell - ECM interactions and irreversible ECM remodeling via Rac - 29 directed protrusion dynamics , at both the single - cell level and the multicellular level . Our findings 30 support that cell volume is a master biophysical regulator and reveal its roles in cell mechanical 31 state transition , cell - ECM interactions , and biophysical tissue programming . 32 1 Introduction 1 2 Volume regulation is critical in cell behavior , function , differentiation , and survival 1 – 3 , which are 3 also codependent on the extracellular context 4 , 5 . The mechanisms underlying the impact of cell 4 volume change on intracellular organization and function and extracellular mechanosensing are 5 not well understood . Moreover , native tissue microenvironments that are composed of a 6 scaffolding extracellular matrix are complex materials with non - elastic properties ( e . g . stress 7 relaxation , strain - induced stiffening , alignment , densification , and plasticity ) 5 , 6 . Together , these 8 render a challenging , dynamic picture of cell mechanosensing and biophysical phenotype 9 regulation in the body . 10 11 The cytoskeleton provides mechanical support and enables physical functions , such as migration 12 and force generation . It is a highly dynamic network of filaments and accessory protein complexes 13 that are constantly undergoing turnover and interactions . Its organization and spatiotemporal 14 profile dictate mechanical outputs and physical interactions with the cell’s surroundings . Actin 15 filaments are the key base components , involved in cell protrusions ( lamellipodia , filopodia ) , force 16 generation ( stress fibers , actin cortex ) , and structure 7 , 8 . Rho GTPases , notably Rac1 , RhoA , and 17 CDC42 are upstream signals that control actin dynamics and cytoskeletal tension through 18 modulating actin nucleation factors and myosin II 9 , 10 . These ultimately determine how the actin 19 cytoskeleton is organized and programmed . 20 21 The extracellular matrix that scaffolds cells in most tissue microenvironments is a complex 22 network of proteins . Collagen I is one of the most prominent components and provides the fibrillar 23 architecture found in many tissues . Unlike standard elastic or purely rigid substrates used in 24 many mechanosensing studies , the ECM is a complex material with non - elastic properties . ECM 25 fibers are interconnected through various bonds that can unbind or become rearranged under 26 applied forces , which can lead to stress relaxation and permanent restructuring of the local 27 architecture and ligand distribution 6 , 11 , 12 . Non - elasticity confers mechanics - driven time - 28 dependence in ECM properties . The interfacing of the dynamic cytoskeleton with the non - elastic 29 ECM through physical contact and adhesions results in spontaneous physical interactions together 30 with biophysical signaling and feedback that underlie tissue development , homeostasis , and 31 pathology 5 , 13 . While the functions of various cytoskeletal features are well known on stiff or elastic 32 substrates , their functions in non - elastic microenvironments are much less established . 33 34 Cell volume changes can be induced by various biophysical stimuli , including osmotic pressure , 35 mechanical compression , and alterations in cell spreading ( e . g . via changes in substrate 36 stiffness ) 1 , 3 , 14 . Hyper - osmotic pressure and mechanical compression can both reduce cell volume 37 through water efflux , resulting in increased intracellular crowding , cytoskeletal concentration , and 38 substantial changes to the physical profile of the cell 3 , 14 . Volume modulation can occur both 39 physiologically and pathologically 1 , 2 . However , it is not well understood how it transforms the 40 cytoskeletal and mechanosensing machinery and biophysical cell and tissue phenotypes , especially 41 in physiologically relevant non - elastic microenvironments . 42 43 Here , we investigate the role of volumetric compression in cytoskeletal reprogramming and its 44 impact on mechanosensing and cell - matrix interactions . We compress cells via osmotic pressure 45 from water soluble , low molecular weight polyethylene glycol ( PEG300 ) 3 , 14 , 15 . We reveal that 46 2 Rho GTPase signaling is altered by volumetric compression . A ratiometric shift between active 1 Rho and Rac alters cytoskeletal organization and cell shape dynamics ; stress fibers across the cell 2 interior and fluctuating lamellipodia are reduced while peripheral actin is increased along with the 3 presence of altered cell adhesions . This modulates mechanosensing , particularly on non - elastic 4 collagen I substrates , which is dependent on dynamic cell boundary fluctuations . Furthermore , we 5 demonstrate that a rebalancing of Rho GTPase activities can override the cytoskeleton state under 6 compression and partially rescue the non - compressed cell phenotypes . 7 8 Results 9 10 Sustained restriction in cell volume alters cell spreading behavior and morphodynamics . In 11 biological processes , such as cancer and development , or after surgical procedures , such as 12 implantation or injection , cells are subjected to mechanical compression in a complex 13 microenvironment with cell - cell and cell - matrix interactions ( Fig . 1A ) . For instance , in 14 hepatocellular carcinoma , we found some regions of the tumors exhibit a gradient of nuclei size 15 and density from the stroma toward the inner region of the tumor ( Fig . 1B , Patient 1 ) . Furthermore , 16 in regions where a tumor grew inside vasculature ( microvascular invasion ) , we observed both 17 compressed endothelial cells and more packed , smaller tumor cells between the solid tumor and 18 the stroma ( Fig . 1B , Patient 2 ) . Abundant studies have supported that dysregulated growth of 19 tumors induces compression on both constitutive cancer cells as well as the normal adjacent 20 cells 16 – 18 , which possibly leads to volumetric compression on cells 19 and changes in cell shape and 21 behaviour 20 . Here , we introduce volumetric compression on mesenchymal - like liver cancer cells 22 ( SNU - 475 ) via polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) - induced colloidal osmotic pressure and allow for cell 23 spreading on a collagen - coated tissue culture plastic surface . After 24 hours of cell spreading , we 24 found that the PEG - induced compression leads to a reduction in cell spreading area and controls 25 cell morphology ( Fig . 1C ) . A higher PEG concentration results in a smaller cell spreading area . 26 These compressed cells also adopted a more “solid - like” , convex shape with less irregularity , 27 characterized by the metric “solidity” ( Fig . 1D ) . To visualize cell shape and volume in 3D , we 28 loaded the cells with CellTracker , a live cytosolic dye , before plating the cells to attach under 29 compression for 24 hours ( Fig . 1E ) . Consistent with the previous studies 3 , 14 , 21 , the inert soluble 30 polymer PEG - 300 in culture media persistently induces compression on cells to reduce cell volume 31 ( Fig . 1F , G ) and subsequently condenses and increases concentrations in the cytosol indicated by 32 the fluorescent intensity of the CellTracker signal ( Fig . 1H ) . 33 34 Cells in the mesenchymal state are highly dynamic and fluid - like to enable morphogenesis 22 and 35 cancer metastasis 23 . Studies have shown that under mechanical stress , mesenchymal cells undergo 36 a dramatic transition in spreading state and migration mode 24 . We investigate how volumetrically 37 compressed mesenchymal cancer cells adapt their spreading state on the rigid 2D surface 38 dynamically ( Supplementary Video 1 ) . Ten - hour time - lapse imaging reveals that under 39 compression the cells spread into smaller areas at a lower rate ( Supplementary Fig . 1A ) with much 40 less volatile edges ( Fig . 1I ) . This is reflected by the soon plateaued cell solidity under compression , 41 while cells in the isotonic condition have rapidly changing cell shape with an increasing 42 irregularity , indicated by a continuously decreasing solidity . When fitting the cell centroids’ 43 movement during cell spreading into the anomalous diffusion model 25 , 26 , we observed less 44 persistence , more confined , and subdiffusive motion under compression ( Supplementary Fig . 1B - 45 F ) . Furthermore , after 24 hours of cell spreading , the compressed cells form “bulge - like” shapes , 46 3 whose heights and contact angles are significantly higher than the “sheet - like” non - compressed 1 cells ( Fig . 1J ) . This indicates that volumetric compression limits cell spreading capability . 2 Literature has shown that cell spreading , cytoskeleton , tension , and nuclear deformation dictate 3 subcellular translocation of YAP / TAZ , a master regulator of mechanostransduction 27 – 29 . We find 4 the compressed cells with restricted cell spreading indeed have reduced YAP nuclear localization 5 and lack perinuclear stress fibers ( Fig . 1K ) . After fully spreading ( ~ 24 hours ) , the cells in the 6 isotonic condition exhibit dramatic morphodynamics with ruffling and cell area fluctuation over 7 two hours , while compressed cells show significantly reduced shape fluctuation and a rather stable 8 cell morphology and area ( Fig . 2A , B and Supplementary Fig . 2A , Supplementary Video 2 ) . 9 10 Volumetric compression regulates the actomyosin - adhesion machinery via Rho and Rac re - 11 balancing . Actin cytoskeletal arrangement is a direct determinant of cell morphology , force 12 generation states , migration , cell - cell communication , and cell interactions with the 13 microenvironment . To understand the impact of volumetric compression on cell spreading 14 dynamics , we investigate actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion using immunofluorescence 15 staining after 24 hours of cell spreading . We observe distinct actin arrangements under varied 16 volumetric compression ( Fig . 2C - E ) . The “solid - like” morphology and the limited dynamics of 17 compressed cells are associated with ( 1 ) the formation of thick actin bundles on the cell periphery 18 that are rich in phosphorylated myosin light chain ( pMLC ) ( Fig . 2E , Supplementary Fig . 2D ) , and 19 ( 2 ) the loss of VASP - rich lamellipodia . Further , abundant VASP is accumulated at the adhesion 20 sites of the peripheral actomyosin bundles ( Fig . 2C , Supplementary Fig . 2B ) , which has been 21 associated with tension maintenance in confluent epithelium 30 . In the isotonic condition , the 22 lamellipodia of cells made up approximately 15 % of the cell area on average , whereas cells have 23 significant area reduction in the lamellipodia portion under 2 % PEG compression and almost no 24 lamellipodia under 4 % PEG compression ( Fig . 2D ) . The impeded growth of lamellipodia 25 subsequently results in the loss of Myosin - X directed filopodia ( Fig . 2F ) . Vinculin , a component 26 of the focal adhesion ( FA ) complex , also exhibits altered morphology and distribution ( Fig . 2G , 27 Supplementary Fig . 2C ) . In the isotonic condition , the cells can form nascent adhesions to guide 28 lamellipodium growth , which are absent in the compressed cells . However , in all conditions , cells 29 formed mature FA plaques to anchor and establish actin stress fibers or peripheral actomyosin 30 bundles . Interestingly , the total FA area per cell is conserved despite the reduction in cell area 31 under the compressed conditions ( Fig . 2H , Supplementary Fig . 2C ) , which give rise to fewer but 32 larger vinculin plaques in highly compressed ( 4 % PEG ) cells . The conserved total FA area 33 suggests a conserved anchorage force for the adhering cells regardless of the volumetric 34 compression 31 , 32 . 35 36 Small GTPases Rho and Rac are master regulators of the actin cytoskeleton . Rho - associated kinase 37 ( ROCK ) , a key downstream effector of RhoA , phosphorylates myosin to generate contractile force , 38 whereas Rac1 facilitates actin elongation , protrusion , and lamellipodia formation 33 . The intricate 39 balance between Rho and Rac determines cell morphology , migratory phenotypes , and cell 40 functions 34 – 37 . Previous studies have shown physical confinements or hyperosmolarity triggers 41 actin cytoskeletal response mediated by Rho / ROCK 24 , 38 – 40 . Here , without compression , Rho and 42 Rac in the mesenchymal - like SNU475 cells coordinate in such a way that the cells spread into thin 43 sheets with pronounced internal actomyosin stress fibers and dynamic lamellipodia . We 44 hypothesize that under volumetric compression , the shifted cell morphology with the assembly of 45 actomyosin bundles on the cell periphery and the loss of lamellipodium is linked to a volume - 46 4 regulated Rho / Rac rebalancing ( Fig . 2J ) . This is confirmed by measuring active ( GTP - bound ) 1 RhoA and active Rac1 from the same batches of cells in the compression conditions after 24 hours 2 of spreading ( Fig . 2I ) . We find that under high volume compression ( 4 % PEG ) , cells have elevated 3 Rho activation and significantly reduced active Rac1 . Interestingly , 2 % PEG compression did not 4 render a detectable enhancement in RhoA activity but was sufficient to suppress Rac1 activity . 5 This compression - suppressed Rac1 activity explains the loss of lamellipodia and reduced 6 morphodynamics . To evaluate the Rho - related actomyosin machinery in the compressed cells , we 7 measure the densities of the actin cytoskeleton and pMLC from fluorescent images 8 ( Supplementary Fig . 2D - G ) . Notably , compared to the isotonic case , the mid - level compressed 9 ( 2 % PEG ) cells have a higher density of pMLC but a similar pMLC density colocalized with F - 10 actin ( pMLC intensity / F - actin intensity ) . In the highly compressed ( 4 % PEG ) cells , although F - 11 actin and pMLC are both highly condensed , the normalized pMLC by the total actin is decreased 12 ( Supplementary Fig . 2G ) , suggesting a lower level of contractile stress despite a high Rho 13 activation . This supports the prior finding that both Rho activity and the extent of cell spreading 14 impact myosin phosphorylation 35 . 15 16 Volumetric compression dictates elastic and non - elastic cell - substrate interactions . To further 17 investigate cellular force and how cells physically interact with their surroundings under 18 volumetric compression , we evaluate cell contractility using both traction force microscopy ( TFM ) 19 and the collagen compaction assay ( Fig . 3 ) . Based on methods developed previously 41 – 44 , we 20 characterized cell traction force by computing the strain energy generated on elastic 21 polyacrylamide ( PA ) substrates with a ~ 3 kPa shear storage modulus ( Supplementary Fig . 3A ) . 22 Consistent with the culture on a rigid substrate , under compression attaching cells adopted a “solid - 23 like” morphology ( Fig . 3A ) and a reduced spreading area ( Fig . 3B ) . To our surprise , strain energy 24 generated by the cells is conserved under 2 % PEG compression compared to isotonic ( Fig . 3C ) 25 despite a smaller cell area , consistent with a higher strain energy density of these compressed cells 26 ( Fig . 3D ) . Under the higher compression ( 4 % PEG ) , the cells no longer generate the same level of 27 strain energy , yet maintain a comparable level of strain energy density with a much smaller cell 28 spreading area . The results of TFM imply that volumetric compression does not suppress or inhibit 29 force generation machinery ( energy density ) but can influence the total mechanical output ( strain 30 energy ) based on the cell spreading area . 31 32 Collagen compaction assays are often used to evaluate cell forces in a soft ECM context . Here , we 33 find volumetric compression also influences the dynamics of collagen gel compaction ( Fig . 3E , 34 F ) . At all levels of compression , the collagen gel area reached the plateau in less than 24 hours . 35 With the increase in compression , the level of collagen compaction decreases . Given that collagen 36 is a highly viscoplastic material , we evaluate the plastic deformation of the gels by completely 37 removing cellular force with the addition of 2 % Triton X - 100 at Hour 48 . After the relaxation of 38 elastic deformations caused by cell contraction , we show that majority of the collagen compaction 39 is plastic ( Fig . 3F , H ) . When exposed to the compression , the plastic compaction of collagen ( Fig . 40 3H ) and the local collagen fiber condensation ( Fig . 3E , third row , and Fig . 3G ) is reduced , as a 41 function of the PEG concentration . Comparing isotonic and 2 % PEG conditions , we find that 42 although cells are able to reach the same level of actomyosin contractility based on traction forces 43 ( Fig . 3C ) , the compressed cells are not able to compact the gel at the same level . This implies that 44 non - elastic ECM remodeling capabilities are altered by compression and that standard TFM 45 measurements do not reveal these features . 46 5 1 Cellular force plastically remodels collagen ECM 45 , 46 . We have previously shown dynamic 2 protrusions of cells are required for continuous recruitment and plastic densification of collagen 6 , 47 . 3 Cells build up both tension and adhesion ligands in fibrous ECM and stiffen the ECM via force 4 and protrusions 48 – 50 . Considering volumetric compression shifts Rac / Rho balance and controls cell 5 morphodynamics ( Fig . 2 ) , we hypothesize the shifted Rac / Rho - regulated cytoskeleton dynamics 6 alter cell - ECM interactions and matrix remodeling under compression . We proceed to investigate 7 the cell - substrate interactions at the single - cell level ( Fig . 4 ) . First , we compare the cell spreading 8 state on fibrous collagen gels ( gel thickness : ~ 200μm ) and elastic polyacrylamide ( PA ) substrates 9 ( Fig . 4A , B ) after seeding under compression for 24 hours . Consistent with previous findings 28 , 51 , 10 on elastic substrates cell spreading and YAP nucleus translocation are stiffness - dependent ( Fig . 4 , 11 Supplementary Fig . 4D ) . On the soft gel ( shear modulus ~ 5 . 5 Pa , at 1Hz , Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , 12 the cells acquire minimal area and stay rounded ( high circularity ) with or without the volumetric 13 compression ( Fig . 4A , B and Supplementary Fig . 4 A - C ) . On the stiff gel ( shear modulus ~ 7 . 5 14 kPa , Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , the cells spread but the spreading area reduced when compression 15 increased . From high - resolution images , we notice the round , non - spreading cells on a soft elastic 16 substrate in the isotonic condition still generate small VASP - rich protrusions while the compressed 17 cells cannot , possibly due to the suppressed Rac activity ( Supplementary Fig . 4C ) . When seeded 18 on a non - elastic collagen surface ( shear modulus ~ 33 Pa , Supplementary Fig . 3 ) with an initial 19 stiffness of the same order of magnitude as the soft elastic PA gels’ stiffness , the cells are able to 20 spread ( Fig . 4A , B ) and strongly engage with the substrate by strain - stiffening and continuous 21 plastic collagen fiber recruitment in the isotonic condition ( Fig . 4e , f , Supplementary Video 3 ) . 22 Under volumetric compression , however , the cells remain round and cannot drive cell spreading 23 on the collagen surface ( Fig . 4A , B , G , H ) . However , when we crosslink collagen via glycation , we 24 partially recover cell spreading under 4 % PEG compression ( Fig . 4C , D ) , presumably via 25 increasing substrate stiffness and reducing force - induced relaxation 47 . The results altogether 26 suggest that volumetric compression does not impair the stiffness - and tension - sensitive 27 actomyosin contractile machinery but rather suppresses the dynamic cytoskeletal protrusion - 28 mediated processes , which are important in the local densification and stiffening of soft non - elastic 29 ECM substrates and the subsequent spreading of cells on the mechanically remodeled 30 environments ( Fig . 4E - H ) . Furthermore , when we remove the contractility of isolated single cells 31 on collagen by depolymerizing actin with Cytochalasin D ( CytoD ) after cell spreading ( Hour 24 ) , 32 the collagen elastically recoiled , leaving behind different levels of plastic collagen densification 33 ( Fig . 4I ) . In the isotonic case , the cells introduce a significant amount of long - range densification 34 of collagen as well as a high strain ( total deformation / cell area ) due to continuous fiber recruitment 35 and cell spreading , while the highly compressed ( 4 % PEG ) cells generate a much shorter range of 36 plastically densified fibers with very limited elastic deformation and strain on the ECM ( Fig . 4I , J ) . 37 Interestingly , the elastic collagen recoil , as well as the strain , in the 2 % PEG condition is on par 38 with that in the isotonic condition ( Fig . 4J ) . This implies that the 2 % PEG compressed cells still 39 generate a considerable amount of contraction despite a reduction in plastic remodeling via 40 reduced dynamic protrusion . 41 42 High - resolution confocal imaging ( Fig . 4K ) and scanning electron microscopy ( Fig . 4L ) further 43 confirm that cells make use of dynamic , far - reaching protrusions to spread on a soft , fibrous 44 collagen surface , and reveal that the compressed cells only form short - range , bleb - like protrusions 45 to interact with the local fibers and reach the spreading equilibrium once the local fibers are 46 6 plastically recruited ( Fig . 4G , H ; Supplementary Video 4 ) . When shortening the cell - cell distance 1 by increasing cell seeding density ( 5 - or 10 - fold increase ) in the collagen compaction assay ( Fig . 2 4M ) , we demonstrate that a larger collection of the short - range plastic recruitment of the 4 % PEG 3 compressed cells is still sufficient to achieve large - scaled plastic compaction of the whole gel . A 4 tenfold increase in cell numbers under the 4 % PEG compression leads to a comparable compacted 5 gel area to the gels in the isotonic case . This confirms the importance and impact of cell protrusion 6 dynamics in non - elastic cell - ECM interactions . 7 8 Forcing the activation of Rac1 restores compressed cells’ spreading , ECM recruitment via 9 dynamic protrusions , and YAP nuclear translocation . The feedback circuit between cell 10 protrusion , cell spreading , and long - range ECM remodeling ( Fig . 4E , F ) is impaired by volumetric 11 compression through a shifted Rho / Rac balance in a contractile cell . On 2D rigid surfaces , the cells 12 undergo a transition from “dynamic” to “constrained” due to inhibited Rac1 and enhanced RhoA 13 activity ( Fig . 1 , 2 , Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Here , we demonstrate the capability of partially reversing 14 compressed cell phenotypes by overriding the compression - induced Rho / Rac circuitry . We apply 15 two strategies ( Fig . 5A ) : ( 1 ) relaxing Rho / ROCK induced actomyosin contractility via the small 16 molecule ROCK inhibitor ( Y27632 ) ; or ( 2 ) enhancing Rac1 activity via constitutively active Rac 17 ( RacV12 ) or a small GTPases activator . We first investigate cell spreading on the rigid surface . 18 With the inhibition of RhoA’s downstream effector ROCK , we recover cell protrusions and 19 spreading of the compressed cells ( Supplementary Fig . 5 , Supplementary Video 5 ) . On the Rac1 20 axis , we find that cells positively transfected with constitutively active Rac ( RacV12 ) exhibit 21 increased cell spreading with edge ruffling under 4 % PEG compression ( Fig . 5B ) . Treating 4 % 22 PEG compressed cells with a small GTPases activator CN04 also recover lamellipodia formation 23 and protrusion dynamics ( Fig . 5C , D , Supplementary Video 6 ) , as well as cell spreading and cell 24 shape ( Fig . 5E ) . We confirm that CN04 induces long - lasting ( at least 6 hours ) effects on Rac1 25 activation but not on RhoA ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . To further rule out the possibility that potential 26 activation of Rho by CN04 contributes to cell spreading , a Rho activator ( CN03 ) is used . We show 27 that solely activating RhoA fails to induce changes in actin organization , cell area , and cell shape 28 in the compressed cells ( Fig . 5C ) . Interestingly , although the GTPase activator CN04 has 29 prolonged activation on Rac1 , the reactivated protrusion dynamics seem to reduce within 2 hours 30 but the cell continues to spread and eventually reaches the steady state at a higher cell area ( Fig . 31 5D , E ) . This may suggest a biphasic effect of Rac on protrusion dynamics ; Rac1 is necessary for 32 protrusion generation but increasingly activated Rac1 over time can also counteract Rho activity 34 , 33 which impedes the retraction of cell protrusions . 34 35 On soft fibrous ECM , we show that reshaping the Rac / Rho balance in the compressed cells by 36 small molecule drugs also switches cell spreading and cell - ECM interaction phenotypes ( Fig . 5f , g , 37 Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Both Rac1 activation ( CN04 ) ( Supplementary Video 7 ) and ROCK 38 inhibition even at low dosing ( Y27632 , 1μM ) , but not Rho activation , can rescue cell spreading in 39 the compressed cells . Notably , the rescued cell spreading by relaxing cell contractility can be 40 inhibited by the Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) , suggesting an inhibitory role 41 of Rho / ROCK - regulated contractility in Rac1 - directed protrusion formation . By measuring fold 42 change in collagen intensity underneath the cells , we find that only Rac1 activation recovers ECM 43 densification and long - range remodeling ( Fig . 5F , G ) . The co - treatment of Rac1 activation by 44 CN04 and ROCK inhibition leads to a more drastic recovery of cell spreading but collagen 45 densification is diminished . At the bulk level , we show that activating Rac1 with the GTPase 46 7 activator in the 4 % PEG compressed cells promote collagen plastic compaction ( Fig . 5H ) . 1 Transfecting the cells with constitutively active Rac also rescues cell spreading on the soft fibrous 2 ECM under 4 % PEG compression but fails to increase collagen densification ( Fig . 5I ) . Although 3 thin edge ruffling is observed in the RacV12 - transfected cells , the lamellipodia formation via the 4 forced Rac activation is likely driven by the actin growth without modulating cell contraction 52 . 5 This suggests that Rho / ROCK - mediated cell contractility and cell protrusion - retraction dynamics 6 are necessary for establishing ECM tension and dynamic fiber recruitment , but ROCK inhibition 7 ( Fig . 5F , G ) or solely activating Rac ( Fig . 5I ) are sufficient to recover tension - independent cell 8 spreading in highly compressed conditions . Furthermore , by comparing YAP nuclear translocation 9 across some conditions where cells can recover spread area while maintaining contractility , 10 including Rac1 activation and collagen cross - linking , we show that compression regulates YAP 11 activity via cell spreading area ( Fig . 5J and Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . By recovering cell spreading 12 via matrix stiffening ( crosslinking ) or activating Rac1 without disrupting cell contractility , we 13 demonstrate a partial rescue of YAP nuclear translocation under high compression . Notably , solely 14 activating RhoA with a suppressed cell spreading under compression is not sufficient to trigger 15 YAP nuclear translocation . 16 17 Rapid switching between actin cytoskeletal states can be controlled by volumetric 18 compression . Consistent with a previous study 53 , the cells allowed to spread for 24 hours in the 19 isotonic condition adopt a polarized morphology with high ECM remodeling in their vicinity . 20 Interestingly , the morphodynamics and protrusions continue enabling ECM recruitment in the less 21 remodeled region over 8 hours ( Fig . 6A , Supplementary Video 8 ) . When shocking a fully 22 spreading cell on collagen with 4 % PEG ( Fig . 6B , Supplementary Video 9 ) , we observe that the 23 cell’s morphodynamics is almost instantly suppressed , leading to a gradual retraction of the 24 established long - reaching protrusions , and eventual cell rounding with a local “condensed ring” of 25 the collagen underneath . Having demonstrated that recovering the highly compressed cells in 26 isotonic media restores cell spreading and ECM recruitment ( Fig . 5F , G ) , time - lapse imaging 27 further confirms that the compressed cells release dynamic protrusions to condense and align the 28 surrounding ECM fibers when reverted back to isotonic media ( Fig . 6C , Supplementary Video 29 10 ) . Together , the results suggest that the volumetric compression effects on morphodynamics and 30 cell protrusions are reversible . 31 32 We then investigate the implications of this reversible effect on the actin cytoskeleton using time - 33 lapse imaging on 2D rigid surfaces ( Fig . 6D , E ) . We utilize Lifeact - RFP expressing SNU475 cells 34 to label actin . These cells exhibit consistent temporal spreading dynamics as observed in the 35 Celltracker labeled cells ( Fig . 1 and Fig . 2 ) under 4 % PEG compression . When spreading in the 36 4 % PEG medium , a gradual transition from the actin cortex to peripheral actin bundles can be seen 37 during cell spreading ( Fig . 6D , Supplementary Video 11 ) . With minimum lamellipodia observed , 38 the extension of these thick actin bundles mainly drives the cell spreading , possibly via adhesion . 39 After 4 - 5 hours , the cell area and morphology reach a steady state with a stable and almost “frozen” 40 actin organization , which resembles the early stage of cell spreading in isotonic conditions ( “Initial 41 contact” stage , Supplementary Fig . 9 and Supplementary Video 12 ) . When released back into 42 isotonic media from 24 - hour compression ( Fig . 6E , Supplementary Video 13 ) , the compressed 43 cells rapidly deploy protrusions , which is also recapitulated by the spreading stage in the isotonic 44 condition ( “Spreading” stage , Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . These newly developed protrusions evolve 45 into sheet - like lamellipodia and facilitate the splitting of the existing thick peripheral actin bundles 46 8 into multiple thinner actin cables , which resemble typical transcellular stress fibers . We thus 1 discover an intrinsic relationship between the cell cortex , thick peripheral actin cables , and 2 transcellular stress fibers , which are inter - convertible by dynamic Rac1 - driven actin protrusions 3 tuned by cell volume . Notably , the restored dynamic protrusions in these “unfrozen” cells growing 4 typically from the vertices of the peripheral actin bundles suggest an inhibitory effect of 5 membrane - proximal actin on cell protrusion formation 54 . These findings highlight a central role 6 of dynamic protrusions in cytoskeletal architecture patterning and redistribution . 7 8 Alongside others 19 , 55 , using multicellular tumor spheroids ( MCTS ) , we demonstrate that fully 9 encapsulated cells in a collagen matrix ( 3D ) capture the same phenotype under compression as 10 seen on the collagen cushions ( Fig . 7A ) . Volumetric compression sufficiently induces 11 mesenchymal cells to transform into a non - motile state and block the “solid to fluid” phase 12 transition 56 , characterized by high solidity of the spheroid shape . By rebalancing Rho / Rac 13 activities via Rac1 activation and ROCK inhibition , we partially recover invading protrusions , 14 measured by a reduction in the spheroid solidity . We also develop a cell culture chip that introduces 15 a continuous osmotic gradient to single cells embedded in 3D collagen ( Fig . 7 B , C ) . We find actin 16 arrangement , actin intensity , and collagen remodeling are functions of the level of environmental 17 osmolality ( Fig . 7 D , E ) , further demonstrating that cell mechanical states can be tightly tuned by 18 cell volume . To demonstrate the universality of the volumetrically controlled cytoskeletal states 19 and YAP translocation cross multiple dynamic cell types , we also volumetrically compress mouse 20 mesenchymal stem cells ( mMSCs ) ( Supplementary Fig . 10A - D ) , metastatic breast cancer cells 21 MDA - MB - 231 ( Supplementary Fig . 10E - H ) , and human umbilical vein endothelial cells 22 ( HUVECs ) ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . After 24 hours of spreading on the rigid surface under 23 compression , all the cell types exhibit polygonal shapes consisting of pronounced peripheral actin 24 bundles and smaller cell area . Interestingly , when losing far - reaching dynamic protrusions under 25 compression , the connectivity of the endothelial cell network is reduced in the tube formation 26 assay on Matrigel ( Supplementary Fig 11E , F ) . By relaxing cell contractility with a ROCK 27 inhibitor , we are able to recover the suppressed protrusions and re - establish the endothelial 28 network . 29 30 Discussions and conclusion 31 32 In this study , we demonstrate that volumetric compression is a biophysical master regulator of 33 mechanobiological cell states and functions , notably cytoskeletal organization and mechanical 34 performance , elastic and non - elastic cell - matrix interactions , and mechanosensing ( Fig . 8 ) . The 35 underlying mechanochemical circuitry is centered on tuning the balance of Rho GTPase activities , 36 highlighting the programmability of these signals by volume regulation . 37 38 Actin organization and structures play functional , mechanical roles . We demonstrate that 39 volumetric compression modulates cytoskeletal states , as well as the distribution of adhesions , 40 reversibly . When compressed , interior stress fibers are significantly reduced and 41 peripheral / cortical actin cables become more prominent , coupled with a loss of lamellipodia and 42 cell boundary fluctuations . In 2D , this is associated with altered adhesions from smaller , evenly 43 distributed plaques to bigger , more clustered adhesion sites that are primarily localized at the cell 44 periphery . Despite the redistribution of cell adhesion , the total adhesion area is conserved . Thus , 45 volumetric compression renders cells to be more polygonal , compact shaped with minimum 46 9 motility , which we term as a “frozen state” . Beside interrogating the volumetric compression , we 1 also report a similar peripheral actin bundle arrangement in response to the mechanical 2 compression applied onto the cells ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) , suggesting a universal cellular 3 response to compressive stresses . Architectural changes in actin can be triggered in response to 4 environmental changes , such as cell confluency 30 , to maintain cohesion and tension across 5 epithelial sheets 57 . Our study isolates the effect of cell volume on cytoskeletal states in single cells 6 and reveals how actomyosin and adhesion machinery respond to volumetric compression . Recent 7 work demonstrates that actin stress fibers can be embedded within the cell actin cortex , and these 8 two actin architectures share synergistic actions in cell contractility 58 . In our study , we show that 9 interior stress fibers and thick peripheral cables can originate from the same actin bundles that can 10 be interconverted via volumetric compression . Specifically , volumetric compression modulates 11 lamellipodia and cell boundary fluctuation dynamics , which mediate the redistribution of stress 12 fibers from within thick peripheral cables . 13 14 In ECMs , cell protrusions can play mechanical roles in cell migration and spreading by non - 15 elastically remodeling the local matrix , e . g . mechanically opening pores or locally accumulating 16 matrix fibers 6 , 59 . Our study demonstrates that volumetric compression regulates cytoskeletal 17 organization and fundamentally alters its mechanical function . Notably , overall cell contractility , 18 which is a common measure of cell mechanical output , does not fully recapitulate the altered states 19 and function of compressed cells , especially in the context of cell - matrix interactions and the cell - 20 induced compaction of non - elastic gels . While cell traction forces are comparable between 21 compressed cells and non - compressed cells ( especially in 2 % PEG vs . isotonic ) , ECM compaction 22 at the global scale and densification at the local scale are significantly reduced under compression 23 ( Fig . 3 ) . These non - elastic interactions are associated with the dynamic fluctuations of the cell 24 periphery , highlighting the importance of cells dynamically “sampling” their surroundings in a 25 complex mechanical environment . These findings provide a potential approach to pattern non - 26 elastic multicellular systems ( e . g . in vitro microtissues 60 ) by tuning cell - ECM interactions via 27 modulating osmolarity ( e . g . a continuous osmotic gradient in 3D matrices , Fig . 7B - E ) . 28 29 The interplay of cells and their substrates entails not only spontaneous mechanical interactions but 30 also feedback through mechanosensing . Recent findings showed the critical impact of substrate 31 stiffness 61 , 62 and Rac1 - mediated rigidity sensing 62 for tumorigenic cell reprogramming . In addition 32 to stiffness , cells can simultaneously exhibit compressed profiles in complex diseased tissues such 33 as expanding tumors ( Fig . 1B ) . Our results show that the interplay between compression and 34 substrate properties modulates mechanosensing phenotypes and subsequent cell and tissue states . 35 On soft , non - elastic collagen substrates , cells can mechanically densify their surroundings , which 36 results in increased ligand density and stiffness . Cells can then sense the remodeled environment 37 and respond accordingly via spreading and transcriptional programs . Compressed cells , however , 38 have impaired ability to mechanically remodel non - elastic surroundings due to suppressed 39 protrusion dynamics , resulting in reduced cell spreading and YAP nuclear translocation on these 40 substrates ( Fig . 5J , and Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . However , compressed cells are still able to respond 41 expectedly to stiff substrates ( e . g . crosslinked collagen or stiff PA substrates ) , indicating that their 42 canonical stiffness - sensing pathways , which are primarily driven by actomyosin contractility and 43 adhesions , are intact ( Fig . 4A - D ) . Our findings highlight the important role of dynamic cell 44 boundary fluctuations , particularly lamellipodial - like dynamics , as the initiator of cell spreading 45 and tension building , as well as the mediator of mechanosensing , in non - elastic substrates . 46 10 Volumetric compression , therefore , acts as a mechanosensing switch in non - elastic tissue 1 microenvironments . 2 3 Our data demonstrate that the impact of volumetric compression on cell states is driven at the 4 molecular signaling level by the rebalancing of Rho GTPase activities , particularly Rac1 and 5 RhoA . Compression suppresses Rac1 and activates RhoA , shifting their equilibrium ratio , leading 6 to the reduction of Rac1 - driven cell spreading and protrusion dynamics while maintaining RhoA - 7 driven contractility . This ratio can be subsequently biochemically controlled to override 8 mechanical regulation of cell states and mechanosensing phenotypes . Reverting Rho GTPase 9 activities by Rac1 activation or ROCK inhibition unfreezes compressed cells and partially rescues 10 protrusion - related cellular functions , such as cell spreading , boundary ruffling , invasive 11 protrusions , and endothelial network formation . In summary , our study reveals the mechanisms 12 and consequences of cell state programming via volumetric compression . 13 14 Acknowledgments 15 16 We thank Dr .

Mouse 3 MSCs and breast cancer cell line MDA - MB - 231 were cultured in DMEM ( Gibco ) with 10 % 4 FBS ( Gibco ) and 1 % Pen Strep ( Gibco ) . HUVECs were cultured in the microvascular 5 endothelial cell growth medium ( Cell Applications ) . Cells were passaged with 0 . 25 % Trypsin - 6 EDTA ( Gibco ) when confluency reached 80 - 90 % . Cell culture medium was changed every 2 - 3 7 days . 8 Method details 9 Cell culture in compression medium 10 To prepare the isotonic and the hyperosmotic culture media with a controlled nutrient 11 concentration , we added 4 % 1xPBS ( isotonic ) , 2 % PEG - 300 plus 2 % 1xPBS ( mid - level 12 compression ) , and 4 % PEG - 300 ( high - level compression ) to the supplemented culture media by 13 volume . All the experiments based on the 2D rigid surface were conducted on collagen I coated 14 plastic surface of 15 - well μ - slides ( ibidi ) . The surface was incubated with 50 μg / mL collagen I 15 ( High concentration rat tail collagen , CORNING ) solution in 0 . 02N acidic acid at 37°C for 1 16 hour , followed by washing three times in PBS and air drying . Trypsinized cells were 17 subsequently resuspended in the isotonic or hyperosmotic media and evenly seeded on the rigid , 18 elastic , or collagen substrates . 19 Collagen cushion fabrication 20 21 For collagen anchorage , the glass surfaces of the 35mm glass - bottom dishes or glass - bottom well 22 plates ( Cellvis ) were coated with 1 . 8 mg / mL 3 - hydroxytyramine hydrochloride ( or dopamine - 23 HCl , Acros Organics ) in 10mM Tris - HCl buffer ( pH 8 . 5 ) for 1 . 5 hours at room temperature 24 ( RT ) , followed by a thorough wash in cell culture grade water . The coated dishes were then air - 25 dried in a 60 °C oven and cooled down to the RT before use . Round glass coverslips ( 8mm in 26 diameter ) were treated in sterilized 3 % bovine serum albumin solution in PBS for 2 - 3 hours at 27 RT or 4°C overnight , rinsed with water , and air - dried before use . High concentration rat tail 28 collagen ( ~ 10mg / mL , CORNING ) was neutralized by 0 . 5M NaOH sterile solution and then 29 adjusted to the final concentration with water and 10x PBS . In this study , the final concentration 30 of collagen is 2mg / mL . A 25 - μL neutralized collagen droplet was gently dispensed onto the 31 dopamine - HCl coated glass surface to form a dome without any bubbles . A BSA - treated 32 coverslip was quickly assembled on top of the collagen dome . Due to the surface tension of the 33 collagen solution , the droplet flattened out to cover the coverslip by maintaining a thickness of a 34 few hundred micrometers . After full gelation at 37°C in a humid incubator for 1 hour , the 35 collagen cushions were soaked in PBS for 15 - 30 min and the top coverslips were then dislodged 36 by gentle PBS streams repeatedly pipetted at the collagen - coverslip interface . To visualize 37 collagen fibers and quantify collagen remodeling , the collagen cushions were incubated in Alexa 38 Fluor 647 NHS Ester dye ( 12 - 20 μg / mL ) ( Thermo ) in PBS at 37°C for 1 hour and were 39 thoroughly washed with sterile PBS for three to five times until the buffer was colorless . 40 41 Post - glycation of collagen cushions 42 14 1 We prepared a ribose ( Sigma ) solution at a concentration of 250mM in PBS . The ribose solution 2 was sterilized with a 0 . 22 μm syringe filter . Collagen cushions were soaked in 2mL ribose 3 solution per dish at 37 °C in a humid incubator for five days . Before seeding cells on the 4 cushion , the collagen cushions were thoroughly washed with fresh PBS three times followed by 5 quenching in the PEG - conditioned media . 6 Fabrication of polyacrylamide ( PA ) substrates 7 To fabricate the soft and stiff PA substrates for cell spreading experiments , we followed the 8 protocol described previously 41 . In brief , clean glass surfaces of 35 - mm glass - bottom dishes were 9 coated with a thin , even layer of 0 . 1N NaOH and then silanized with ( 3 - 10 aminopropyl ) trimethoxysilane ( Thermo Scientific ) for 3 min . After a thorough wash , the glass 11 surfaces were treated with 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde ( Polysciences , Inc . ) for 30 min . The dishes were 12 then rinsed with deionized water and dried in a 60 °C oven . A gel premix was made of 250 μL 13 40 % acrylamide ( AA ) ( Sigma ) and 125 μL 2 % bis - acrylamide ( bis - AA ) ( Sigma ) . The soft gel is 14 made by thoroughly mixing 20 μL premix and 230 μL PBS , and the stiff gel is made by mixing 15 75 μL premix and 175 μL PBS . Polymerization of the PA gels was initiated by introducing 0 . 75 16 μL N , N , N′ , N′ - tetramethylethylenediamine ( TEMED ) ( MP Biomedicals , LLC ) and 2 . 5 μL 10 % 17 ammonium persulfate ( APS ) ( Sigma ) . 15 μL of the final mix was dispensed on the silanized 18 glass surface and rapidly covered by a dichlorodymethyl silane ( Sigma ) - treated square coverslip 19 ( 12mm×12mm ) . The gel mix was allowed to polymerize for 30 min before the coverslip was 20 carefully removed . After a 30 min UV sterilizing cycle in sterile PBS , the PA substrates were 21 functionalized with 0 . 2mg / mL Sulfo - SANPAH ( Thermo Fisher ) followed by incubation in 100 22 μg / mL collagen I solution in 0 . 2N acidic acid at 4°C overnight . The substrates were washed 23 three times with PBS before seeding cells . 24 Traction force microscopy 25 26 The elastic PA substrates for TFM were prepared and functionalized by the protocol described in 27 the previous sections , except that the gel mix was made followed by the reported recipe 63 : 94 μL 28 40 % AA , 15μL 2 % bis - AA , 364 μL PBS , 3 . 4 μL 0 . 2 - μm dark red carboxylated microbeads 29 ( Invitrogen ) , 5 μL 10 % APS and 1 μL TEMED . The shear modulus of the gel was characterized 30 by a rheometer as 3 kPa . SNU475 cells were seeded on the PA substrates at the density of 2000 - 31 4000 cells / dish in the isotonic or PEG - conditioned media for 24 hours . Before the experiments , 32 the cells were labeled with CellTracker Green ( Invitrogen ) for 25 min and washed with the same 33 conditioned medium . Randomly selected isolated single cells and the microbeads substrate were 34 imaged with a 20× objective on a position - saving confocal microscope ( Leica SP8 ) . The cells 35 were then removed by carefully adding PBS - diluted Triton X - 100 ( Sigma ) into the dish at a final 36 concentration of 8 % . The recorded positions of the microbeads substrates were imaged again 37 after 15 min . The drift between microbeads fields before and after the cell removal was corrected 38 with the plugins “Correct 3D drift” or “Descriptor - based registration” on ImageJ . The 39 microbeads displacement field was calculated by the plugin “PIV” and cell traction force was 40 then calculated and plotted by the plugin “FTTC” using a Poisson ratio of 0 . 5 and a regulation 41 factor of 3×10 - 9 . Strain energy of a single cell was derived using the calculated traction vectors 42 ( T ) and deformation vectors ( u ) by the following definition ( Eq . 1 ) : 43 15 1 𝑊 = 1 2 ∫ 𝑑𝐴𝑇 ( 𝑟 ) ⋅ 𝑢 𝑠 ( 𝑟 ) ( 1 ) 2 3 RhoA and Rac1 activation assays 4 5 Colorimetric - based GLISA assays ( Cytoskeleton , Inc . ) were used to quantify RhoA and Rac1 6 activity . SNU475 cells ( 500 , 000 cells / dish ) were seeded on collagen I - coated 100 mm plastic 7 Petri dishes ( Falcon ) in the isotonic or PEG - conditioned medium . Cells were allowed to spread 8 for 24 hours . For the drug treated conditions , the drugs were added in the culture at Hour 18 and 9 the cells were treated with the drugs for 6 hours . At Hour 24 , the cells were washed with ice - cold 10 PEG - conditioned PBS and lysed with lysing buffer . The protein was clarified by 1 min high 11 speed centrifuging ( 10 , 000 RPM ) at 4°C , aliquoted in pre - chilled microcentrifuge tubes , and then 12 snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80°C . To prevent extensive hydrolysis of the active 13 ( GTP - bound ) G - proteins , only one dish of cells was handled each time . The lysing procedure for 14 each dish was done within 10 min . A small aliquot of cell lysate was later thawed and used for 15 total protein quantification following the “BCA Protein Assay Kit” manual ( Thermo Scientific ) . 16 The same quantity ( 60 μL ) of total protein from each condition at the concentration of 0 . 5 17 mg / mL was loaded in duplicate or triplicate wells of the GLISA plate . The procedures of protein 18 binding , antigen presenting , conjugation of primary and secondary antibodies , and signal 19 detection were conducted strictly following the manufacturer’s manual . The signal in each well 20 was read by a microplate spectrophotometer ( Molecular Devices ) at the absorbance of 490 nm . 21 22 Rheological characterizations on PA and collagen gels 23 24 An Anton Parr Shear Stress Rheometer was used for the mechanical characterization of collagen 25 gels with the 25 - mm parallel - plate geometry and a 500µm gap . A 25 - mm no . 1 cover glass 26 ( VWR ) was used for the top plate and a 40 mm cover glass ( Fisherbrand ) as the bottom plate . 27 Both silanized cover glasses were attached to each plate of the rheometer with double - sided tape 28 ( 3M 666 ) . Polyacrylamide was deposited onto the bottom plate of the rheometer immediately 29 before gelation , and the top plate was lowered rapidly so that the gel formed a uniform disk 30 between the two plates . Approximately , 300 µL of solution was pipetted onto the rheometer , the 31 gap was set to 500µm , and the sample was kept in a custom - made humidity chamber to prevent 32 evaporation . Polymerization progress was monitored by imposing three cycles of 0 . 5 % strain 33 every 5 min , measuring the shear storage modulus G′ as a function of polymerization time . For 34 strain sweep measurements , gels were subjected to 5 oscillations at 0 . 1 Hz at increasing 35 amplitudes from 2 to 12 % in 2 % increments and 12 to 100 % in 4 % increments . Logarithmic 36 frequency sweeps ( 0 . 01 ~ 3 Hz ) were performed on the soft PA gel and the stiff PA gel at a 5 % 37 strain . 38 39 Sample preparation for scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) 40 41 Spreading cells on the collagen cushions were fixed with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde ( Polysicences , 42 Inc . ) diluted in PEG - conditioned PBS overnight at 4°C . The fixed samples were washed three 43 times and then treated with 1 % OsO 4 in PBS for 1 hour . The samples were then thoroughly 44 washed in deionized water three times and gradually dehydrated in ethanol with an incrementally 45 increased concentration : 30 % , 50 % , 70 % , 80 % , 90 % , and 95 % . Samples were treated for at least 46 16 5 min in each ethanol bath . The samples were then soaked in fresh 100 % ethanol for 5 min three 1 times , followed by 50 % ethanol plus 50 % hexamethyldisilazane ( HMDS ) for 30 min and 100 % 2 HMDS for 30 min . After the removal of excessive HMDS , the fully dehydrated samples were 3 air - dried in the chemical hood overnight . The samples were kept dry in a desiccator before SEM 4 imaging . Samples were then mounted on a support with carbon tape ( 3M ) and then covered with 5 an 8nm layer of iridium with a sputter coater . 6 7 Immunofluorescence staining 8 9 Cells were washed with PEG - conditioned PBS and then fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) 10 ( Santa Cruz ) for 15 min at room temperature ( RT ) . PFA was also accordingly conditioned with 11 PEG300 to minimize the potential osmolarity shock during fixation . After washing the cells three 12 times with PBS , the cells were permeabilized with 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 15 min and 13 then blocked in 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in PBS for 1 hour at RT . After blocking , 14 samples were incubated with the primary antibodies in PBS overnight at 4°C . Followed by a 15 thorough wash three times in PBS for 1 hour , the samples were stained with the secondary 16 antibodies and rhodamine - phalloidin for F - actin in the dark for 1 hour at RT . After a thorough 17 wash in PBS three times for 1 hour , the cells were then stained with nucleus dye Hoechst before 18 the imaging . The primary antibodies used in this study are : anti - YAP ( sc - 101199 , Santa Cruz , 19 1 : 200 ) , anti - vinculin ( sc - 73614 , Santa Cruz , 1 : 200 ) , anti - Myosin light chain ( phospho S20 ) 20 ( ab2480 , Abcam , 1 : 200 ) , anti - VASP ( sc - 46668 , Santa Cruz , 1 : 200 ) , anti - MYO10 ( PAB21665 , 21 Abnova , 1 : 200 ) , and a dye - conjugated antibody anti - hemagglutinin ( HA ) tag - Dylight 488 22 ( 26183 - D488 , Invitrogen ) . The secondary antibodies used in this study are : Alexa Fluor 488 23 Goat Anti - Mouse IgG antibody ( Invitrogen , A - 11001 ) and Alexa Fluor 647 Goat Anti - Rabbit 24 IgG antibody ( Invitrogen , A - 21244 ) . We use Hoechst 33342 ( Invitrogen , H3570 , 1 : 2000 ) to stain 25 the cell nuclei , and Rhodamine Phalloidin ( Abcam , ab235138 , 1 : 1000 ) or Alexa Flr 488 26 Phalloidin ( Invitrogen , A12379 , 1 : 500 ) to stain for F - actin . 27 28 Drug treatments 29 30 Small molecule drugs used in this study are : ROCK inhibitor Y27632 ( Cayman ; 1μM and 25 μM 31 for SNU475 cells ; 5μM for HUVECs ) , Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 ( Tocris ; 50μM ) , actin 32 polymerization inhibitor Cytochalasin D ( Abcam ; 20 μM ) , Rho activator CN03 ( Cytoskeleton , 33 Inc . ; 1μg / mL ) , Small GTPases ( Rho / Rac / Cdc42 ) activator CN04 ( Cytoskeleton , Inc . ; 1μg / mL ) . 34 35 Collagen compaction assay 36 37 24 - well plates were coated with 500 μL 3 % BSA in PBS per well at RT for 1 hour , then rinsed 38 with PBS , and air - dried in a sterile environment . 500 μL neutralized 2mg / mL collagen mixed 39 with SNU475 cells at densities of 0 . 3×10 6 cells / mL , 1 . 5×10 6 cells / mL , or 3×10 6 cells / mL was 40 dispensed in each well and quickly transferred in the cell culture incubators ( 37°C ) and allowed 41 to polymerize for 1 hour . 1mL of isotonic or PEG - conditioned cell culture medium was gently 42 added to each well from the side to dislodge the gel . The gels were cultured for up to 48 hours 43 and the media were changed every day for the density of 0 . 3×10 6 cells / mL and twice a day for 44 gels with higher seeding density . Macrographs were taken to record the gel area in each well 45 over time . To estimate the plastic compaction of the gels , the cellular force was completely 46 17 removed in 2 % Triton X - 100 by replacing 500 μL culture medium with 500 μL 4 % Triton X - 100 1 in PBS at Hour 48 followed by incubation at 4°C overnight . We define the initial gel area at 2 Hour 0 is A 0 , the gel area at Hour 48 before decellularization is A plastic + elastic , and the relaxed gel 3 area after decellularizing is A plastic . The mechanics of collagen compaction and the contribution of 4 cellular force are evaluated as percentages defined as total compacted area C total , plastically 5 compacted area C plastic , and elastically recoilled area normalized by plastically compacted area 6 C recoilled : 7 8 Total compacted area ( C total ) : 9 𝐶 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 𝐴 𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐 + 𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐 𝐴 0 × 100 % ( 2 ) 10 Plastically compacted area ( C plastic ) : 11 𝐶 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 𝐴 𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐 𝐴 0 × 100 % ( 3 ) 12 Normalized elastic recoiling ( C recoilled ) : 13 𝐶 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑑 = 𝐴 𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐 −𝐴 𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐 + 𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐 𝐴 𝑝 × 100 % ( 4 ) 14 15 Tube formation assay for HUVECs 16 17 Ice cold 10μL of growth factor reduced Matrigel ( CORNING ) was dispensed in each well of a 18 15 - well µ - Slide ( ibidi ) and then gelled at 37°C for 30 minutes . After the full gelation of the 19 Matrigel , 50 μL of endothelial cell growth medium conditioned with PEG - 300 or ROCK 20 inhibitor Y27632 with 10 , 000 cells was evenly plated on the Matrigel surfaces . The cells were 21 allowed to spreading and form 2D tubular structures for 24 hours . The live GFP - labelled cells in 22 each well were then scanned by an EVOS imaging system ( Invitrogen ) . The cells were also fixed 23 and their F - actin was stained by rhodamine phalloidin . 24 25 Cell transfection 26 27 RacV12 : The plasmid of constitutively active Rac1 ( RacV12 ) was a kind gift from Dr .

SNU475 cells were plated in a 6 - well plate at a density of 5×10 4 29 cells / well and allowed to attach and proliferate for 2 days to reach a ~ 80 % confluency . The cells 30 were then transfected with RacV12 ( 0 . 17 μg / well ) in Opti - MEM ( Gibco ) containing 5 . 5 μL 31 Lipofectamine 3000 ( Invitrogen ) , following the manufacturer’s protocol . The “Control” cells 32 were the cells treated with Lipofectamine 3000 without the plasmid . After 4 hours of culture in 33 the transfection reagent , the media were replaced with fresh complete RPMI medium and the 34 cells were allowed to recover and express RacV12 for 2 days before using the cells for 35 experiments . RacV12 - positive cells co - expressed Hemagglutinin ( HA ) which was determined 36 after fixation by immunofluorescence staining with the antibody HA - 488 . The baseline signal for 37 RacV12 - positive cells was defined as higher than the maximum mean intensity of the 488 signal 38 of the Lipofectamine - treated “control” cells . 39 40 LifeAct - RFP : SNU475 cells in a well of a 24 well plate ( 2×10 4 cells / well ) were treated in 500 μL 41 complete RPMI medium with 8 μg / mL polybrene ( Sigma ) and 2μL ( 2 multiplicity of infection ) 42 rLV Ubi - LifeAct - TagRFP lentiviral vector ( ibidi ) for 16 hours , The medium was then replaced 43 18 with fresh medium and cells were allowed to expand for 2 days . Stably transfected ( RFP 1 positive ) cells were then selected with 2 μg / mL puromycin ( Gibco ) in the culture medium . 2 3 Osmotic gradient device 4 5 A PDMS sheet with a 2mm thickness was cut to fit on a round glass cover slip ( diameter : 6 40mm ) . A ~ 4mm width , 13mm long channel was cut out of the PDMS block by a scalpel blade . 7 A reservoir was then cut out on each side of the channel by an 8mm biopsy punch twice so that 8 each reservoir can roughly contain 200 μL culture medium . The PDMS block and the glass cover 9 slip were permanently bond together after a surface treatment in an air plasma cleaner . This open 10 channel device was sterilized in 70 % ethanol and then air dried in a tissue culture cabinet . Two 11 small pieces of PDMS was used to plug the two ends of the channel to create a small vessel . 12 Approximately 120 μL collagen ( 2mg / mL ) with a cell density of 10 , 000 cells / mL ( SNU475 13 cells ) was then filled up the straight channel without leakage into the reservoirs . After gelling the 14 collagen at 37°C for 1 hour , the PDMS plugs were removed and ~ 200 μL isotonic medium was 15 added in both reservoirs . The medium was allowed to diffuse into the gel at 37°C for 1 hour from 16 both sides until the color of the gel became uniform . Then media were changed to fresh isotonic 17 medium and 4 % PEG medium respectively in the two reservoirs . The device was carefully 18 transferred into the incubator and cultured for 24 hours . The same medium type was replenished 19 at Hour 12 . At Hour 24 , the gel on the device was fixed and stained with rhodamine phalloidin 20 and Hoechst . A confocal image volume stack was taken to cover the whole length of the channel 21 with a 1200 μm width and a 1000 μm depth . 22 23 Tumor invasion in the 3D collagen ECM 24 25 SNU475 tumor spheroids were made from 1 , 000 cells in 100uL culture medium per well in an 26 ultra - low attachment 96 well round bottom plate ( CORNING ) for 2 days . The spheroids were 27 collected and mixed into a 2mg / mL neutralized rat tail collagen precursor solution . It was made 28 sure about 4 - 5 spheroids were incorporated in 60uL gel solution per well in dopamine - HCl 29 functionalized glass bottom 12 - well plates ( Cellvis ) . The gel droplets formed domes and were 30 allowed to solidify for 1 hour at 37°C , followed by the addition of isotonic or PEG - conditioned 31 media with or without drug treatments . The spheroids were then allowed to grow for 48 hours . 32 33 Applying mechanical compression on cells 34 35 Planar mechanical compression was applied on cells , following the previously reported 36 method 65 . In brief , LifeAct - SNU475 cells ( 8 , 000 cells / well ) were plated on 50μg / mL collagen I 37 coated 0 . 4 μm pore polyester transwells in 6 - well plates ( Corning ) . Round agarose cushions 38 ( diameter : 20mm ) were cut out from a ~ 2mm thick sterile 0 . 8 % ( w / v ) agarose sheet formed in a 39 petri dish . The agarose cushions were gently placed on top of the cell covered transmembranes 40 after the cells were allowed to attach for 2 hours . The cells were considered under minimum 41 compression from the agarose cushions due to the buoyancy . For the compressed condition , a 42 small cup filled with stainless steel balls weighing 25 g in total was gently placed on top of the 43 agarose cushion , which introduced approximately 5 . 8 mmHg ( ~ 773Pa ) pressure on the cells . 44 Both sides of the transwells were filled with complete culture medium . The cells in this 45 experiment setup were cultured for 24 hours . The cells were then washed with PBS and fixed 46 19 with 4 % PFA before the weights and cushions were removed . The transwells were transferred to 1 a glass bottom dish for confocal imaging . 2 3 Schematic illustrations 4 5 Schematics in the manuscript were designed and drawn using an open - source software Inkscape . 6 7 Microscopic imaging and data analysis 8 9 All fluorescent imaging was conducted on a confocal microscope ( Leica SP8 ) equipped with an 10 environmental chamber ( 37°C , 5 % CO 2 ) for the live - cell imaging . For the time - lapse imaging of 11 cell spreading , long - distance 10x or 20x objectives were used . Fluorescent images were acquired 12 with the long - distance 20x objective or a water immersion 40x objective . For live cell imaging 13 and , cells were stained with CellTracker Green ( Invitrogen , C7025 , 1 : 1000 dilution ) for 25 min , 14 washed with PBS , centrifuged , and resuspended in a fresh culture medium . For the high - 15 resolution cell volume reconstruction and calculation , live CellTracker - labelled cells were 16 imaged with the water immersion 40x objective with a z - step of 0 . 1 μm . All image analysis was 17 performed with Fiji ( ImageJ ) 64 . Cell spreading area and shape descriptors ( solidity and 18 circularity ) were quantified by manual tracing or generating a binary mask from the fluorescent 19 images . FA size was characterized based on the confocal fluorescent images ( max projection ) , 20 using ImageJ with this sequence : “Subtract Background > Gaussian Blur , 21 sigma = 0 . 6 > Threshold > Convert to Mask > Analyze Particles” . YAP subcellular localization was 22 determined by the ratio of YAP mean intensity in the nuclei and cytoplasm following the 23 quantifying method published previously 28 , 29 . Masks of the nucleus or whole cell shape were 24 manually traced or segmented with ImageJ . Using the high resolution live CellTracker images 25 and ImageJ’s “3D Objects Counter” , we estimated cell volume by the voxel number from the 26 thresholded CellTracker signal , following a previously reported protocol 3 . 27 Statistics 28 The statistical tests , the number of biological replicates , and technical replicates were stated in 29 figure legends . The statistical comparisons were performed using either Origin 2020b 30 ( OriginLab ) or GraphPad Prism 9 ( GraphPad ) . 31 32 References 33 34 1 . Hoffmann , E . K . , Lambert , I .

Proposed model of the mechanosensing and cell - ECM nonelastic interactions 1 dictated by Rho / Rac rebalancing via volumetric compression . ( A ) Shifted cell mechanosensing 2 under volumetric compression . The intact actomyosin machinery enables cells to spread via 3 stiffness sensing on elastic , rigid surfaces with a changed arrangement of cytoskeleton and FA 4 with a conserved total FA area . However , on the soft non - elastic collagen the suppressed dynamic 5 protrusions fail to initiate the long - range fiber recruitment thus the strain stiffening in the ECM to 6 facilitate further cell spreading , which can be reverted by re - activating Rac1 in the compressed 7 cells . Due to the intact actomyosin machinery and rigidity sensing , increasing ECM tension by 8 collagen fiber crosslinking is also sufficient to partially rescue the suppressed cell spreading under 9 compression . Furthermore , this volumetrically controlled cell mechanical state by osmolarity is 10 reversible by cell volume recovery .

Characterization of spreading dynamic of cells under compression . 4 ( A ) Spreading rate of the cells between 15 - min time intervals over the course of the 10 - hour time - 5 lapse imaging . In the isotonic condition and 2 % PEG condition , the cells rapidly spread in the first 6 hour and then continue spreading at a slowed - down rate afterward . The 4 % PEG renders a rather 7 stably low spreading rate . Overall , the non - compressed cells exhibit a much higher spreading rate . 8 Data represent mean±s . e . m .

( F ) The logarithmic 13 derivative β ( t ) of the MSD trajectories characterizes the cell movement as the anomalous diffusion 14 model .

Rheological characterization of polyacrylamide ( PA ) gels and 3 collagen . ( A ) A strain sweep ( 1 % - 300 % ) was used to characterize the mechanical property ( shear 4 storage modulus : G’ ; shear loss modulus : G’’ ) of the PA gel ( with microbeads ) used for the traction 5 force microscopy . The shear storage modulus ( G’ ) of the gel substrate at 1 Hz is ~ 3 kPa , therefore 6 the estimated Young’s modulus is ~ 9 kPa , assuming PA is nearly incompressible ( Poisson ratio 7 equals 0 . 5 ) . This Young’s modulus was used to calculate the strain energy generated by the cells 8 in Fig 3 . ( B ) Frequency sweeps ( 0 . 01 ~ 3 Hz ) were performed on the soft PA gel and the stiff PA 9 gel at a 5 % strain . The “soft” and “stiff” PA gels were used to demonstrate cell spreading on an 10 elastic substrate in Fig 4 . ( C ) Strain sweeps ( 1 % - 300 % ) at the frequency of 1 Hz were also 11 performed to characterize both soft and stiff PA gels , as well as the collagen gel ( 2mg / mL ) . With 12 the strain increasing , the PA gels exhibit constant modulus ( elastic behavior ) , while collagen 13 exhibit strain stiffening behavior before failure . The shear storage moduli of the soft gel , the stiff 14 gel , and collagen are 5 . 5 Pa , 7 . 5 kPa , and 33 Pa at 1 Hz , respectively . ( D ) Cyclic shear rheology 15 reveals a nonlinear viscoplastic behavior of collagen at 20 % and 40 % strains .

We demonstrate that solely activating Rho does not rescue cell spreading . 10 Relaxing cell contractility significantly rescues the compression - suppressed cell spreading and 11 protrusion formation , which can be inhibited by the Rac1 inhibitor . This demonstrates the 12 inhibitory effects of Rho / ROCK contractility on Rac1 - guided protrusion formation . 13 50 1 Supplementary Figure 8 .

Spreading of a LifeAct - labelled SNU475 cell on the 2D rigid surface 2 over 10 hours in the isotonic condition . There are three stages of cell spreading : ( I ) Initial 3 contact : the round cell adheres to the substrate with only cortical actin . Over time , the cortical actin 4 flattens out to become peripheral actin bundles . The bundles extend the cell body and establish 5 multiple adherent vertices with no evident lamellipodia formed . At the moment , the cell exhibits 6 a distinct polygonal shape . ( II ) Spreading : sheet - like dynamic lamellipodia are formed from the 7 vertices ( enlarged in the insets ) to facilitate the separation of the peripheral actin bundles into stress 8 fibers .
