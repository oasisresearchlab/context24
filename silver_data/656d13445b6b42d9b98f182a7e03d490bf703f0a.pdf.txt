Remarkably , another event that is completely di ﬀ erent from those related to actin regulation has the same relevance ; the Rac1 - mediated production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) through NADPH oxidases ( NOX ) . Each outcome involves di ﬀ erent Rac1 downstream e ﬀ ectors ; on one hand , events related to the actin cytoske - leton require Rac1 to bind to WAVEs proteins and PAKs that ultimately promote actin branching and turnover , on the other , NOX - derived ROS production demands active Rac1 to be bound to a cytosolic activator of NOX . How Rac1 - mediated signaling ends up promoting actin - related events , NOX - derived ROS , or both is poorly understood . Rac1 regulators , including sca ﬀ old proteins , are known to exert tight control over its functions . Hence , evidence of Rac1 regulatory events leading to both actin remodeling and NOX - mediated ROS generation are discussed . Moreover , cellular functions linked to physiological and pathological conditions that exhibit crosstalk between Rac1 outcomes are analyzed , while plausible roles in neuronal functions ( and dysfunctions ) are highlighted . Together , discussed evidence shed light on cellular mechanisms which requires Rac1 to direct either actin - and / or ROS - related events , helping to understand crucial roles of Rac1 dual functionality . 1 . Introduction Small RhoGTPases are single - domain nucleotide - dependent binary switches that act as highly - tuned regulators in signal transduction [ 1 ] . The cycling between active GTP - bound and inactive GDP - bound forms allows RhoGTPases to bind to or to dissociate from downstream e ﬀ ec - tors , respectively [ 2 ] . Guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) that catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP , and GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) that increase intrinsic GTP hydrolysis are respectively re - sponsible for RhoGTPases switching between their active and inactive form [ 3 ] . Furthermore , switching between GDP and GTP may involve cytosol - membrane translocation , as farnesyl or geranylgeranyl - carrying RhoGTPases can form soluble complexes with guanine dissociation in - hibitors ( GDIs ) , thus preventing RhoGTPases from membrane - targeting and GEFs - mediated activation [ 4 ] . A remarkable feature of RhoGT - Pases - based signaling networks is that speci ﬁ c interacting patterns be - tween GEFs and RhoGTPases , coupled with post - translational mod - i ﬁ cations and sca ﬀ olding molecules lead to spatiotemporal promotion of determined outcomes [ 5 ] . Ras - related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 ( Rac1 ) , a member of the RhoGTPases family , has a pivotal role in the regulation of actin polymerization during cytoskeletal rearrangement events [ 6 ] . Rac1 - mediated actin regulation takes place through binding of Rac1 to the sca ﬀ olding molecule known as insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 ( IRSp53 ) , thus leading to Rac1 binding to WASP - family verprolin - homologous ( WAVE ) proteins [ 7 ] . As a result , WAVEs bind to and activate the actin - nucleating protein , actin - related protein 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex , which initiates growth of new branched ﬁ la - ments [ 8 ] . Another way in which Rac1 can regulate the actin cytos - keleton is by binding to p21 - activated kinases ( PAKs ) which in turn conducts cytoskeletal rearrangement via phosphorylating Lim kinases ( LIMKs ) [ 9 ] . LIMKs phosphorylate co ﬁ lin subsequently , thereby re - leasing it from actin ﬁ laments and thus suppressing actin - severing ac - tivity [ 10 ] . In this way , the Rac1 / Pak1 / LIMK1 / co ﬁ lin axis may mod - ulate the turnover of actin ﬁ laments at the lamellipodium [ 11 ] . Rac1 - mediated actin regulation has important roles in cell - cell adhesion [ 12 ] , cell - extracellular matrix ( ECM ) early interaction [ 13 ] , cell polarization [ 14 ] and cell mobility [ 15 ] . These events are widely regarded as actin - related outcomes of the Rac1 signaling axis . Additionally , Rac1 is in - dispensable for the assembly of the membrane - located superoxide - producing NADPH oxidase ( NOX ) complexes , where it is required for the electron transfer from NADPH to oxygen [ 16 ] . NOX isoforms I and II ( NOX1 and NOX2 ) are activated via Rac1 having relevant roles in physiology and in several human diseases including neurodegenerative pathologies [ 17 ] . Besides Rac1 , the assembly of the NOX complex https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . freeradbiomed . 2018 . 01 . 008 Received 2 August 2017 ; Received in revised form 3 January 2018 ; Accepted 5 January 2018 ⁎ Correspondence to : Laboratory of Cell and Neuronal Dynamics , Faculty of Sciences , Universidad de Chile , Las Palmeras 3425 , 7800024 Santiago , Chile .

T requires the binding of at least two cytoplasmic subunits ( an activator and an organizer ) to the membrane - located catalytic subunit , which in turn must be bound to a membrane - located anchorage subunit [ 18 ] . The cytoplasmic activators p67 phox and NOXA1 are the NOX2 and NOX1 components serving as targets for Rac1 , respectively [ 19 ] . In the cytosol , prenylated Rac1 is inactive and bound to RhoGDIs [ 20 ] . Through various receptor - mediated signaling cascades that involve Rac1 GEFs , the Rac1 - RhoGDI complex is translocated to the membrane [ 21 , 22 ] . NOXs enzymes play signi ﬁ cant roles in endothelial functions [ 23 ] , cellular proliferation [ 24 ] , cancer [ 25 ] , establishment of neuronal polarity [ 26 ] and neurodegeneration [ 27 ] . Taken together , it is evident that Rac1 presents two di ﬀ erent downstream outcomes ; actin - and NOX - related events ( Fig . 1 ) . How Rac1 can promote each outcome in a coordinated manner is intriguing . An example of Rac1 - mediated sig - naling bifurcation is seen in the context of MAP kinases function . In this way , Wu et al . [ 28 ] showed that downstream from Tat ( Human im - munode ﬁ ciency virus type 1 transactivator of transcription ) signaling , two independent Rac1 - mediated outcomes take place ; activation of RhoA - Nox4 - dependent Ras / ERK which favors proliferation , and acti - vation of PAK1 - Nox2 - dependent JNK that promotes cytoskeletal re - arrangement It has been suggested that RhoA may favor Nox4 activity via up - regulating its expression levels during ﬁ broblast di ﬀ erentiation [ 29 ] . However , the correlation between RhoA and Nox4 is not resolved and appears to be context - dependent as recent evident shows that loss of Nox4 increases levels of RhoA in Huh7 and PLC / PRF / 5 cells , while overexpression of Nox4 in SNU449 cells increased RhoA levels [ 30 ] . In the present review , we are interested in Rac1 - mediated signaling bi - furcation regarding ROS production and actin regulation outcomes , which have been studied mostly as separate events . Here , we bring together evidence of co - occurrence and crosstalk between both func - tions . One layer of modulation for such outcomes is provided by Rac1 regulators , namely GEFs , GAPs and GDIs . Then Rac1 regulators driving both actin - and NOX - related outcomes are discussed . Moreover , cross - talk events between Rac1 axes involving redox signaling are also ad - dressed along with their physiological and pathological roles high - lighting possible roles in neuronal functions . 2 . Linking H 2 O 2 - dependent redox signaling to Rac1activity 2 . 1 . H 2 O 2 - induced protein modi ﬁ cations and redox signaling Once produced , the anion superoxide is dismutated into hydrogen peroxide either by superoxide dismutases or spontaneously [ 31 ] . Hy - drogen peroxide in turn can pass through membranes and oxidize protein thiol groups [ 32 ] . Though NOX - mediated ROS production occurs on the outer side of the plasma membrane , signi ﬁ cant amounts of NOX - derived ROS di ﬀ use into the cytoplasm triggering locally re - stricted redox events [ 33 ] . Particularly , H 2 O 2 generates reversible oxidation of cysteine residues [ 34 ] yielding either disul ﬁ de bonds ( RS - SR ' ) , glutathione disul ﬁ de ( GSSG ) or S - glutathionylated proteins ( R - SSG ) [ 35 ] , as well as S - nitrosylation if nitric oxide , nitroxyl or perox - ynitrite are involved [ 36 ] . Such events modulate signaling networks thus making hydrogen peroxide a relevant second messenger [ 37 , 38 ] . 2 . 2 . H 2 O 2 - mediated signaling con ﬁ nement by antioxidant systems As for case of other second messengers , H 2 O 2 - mediated signaling is spatiotemporally constrained . In this sense , compartmentalized events such as H 2 O 2 microdomains and gradients have been implicated in several cellular functions [ 39 , 40 ] . How H 2 O 2 locally exerts its role is still a matter of debate ; nonetheless , the action of the antioxidant sys - tems provide hints on how this might occur . Breakdown of H 2 O 2 is conducted by peroxidases such as catalase , glutathione peroxidase and peroxiredoxins . Importantly , cysteine oxidations can be reversed via the activity of the latter antioxidant anzymes [ 41 ] . An excellent review by Ren et al . [ 42 ] highlights that thioredoxin ( Trx ) and glutathione ( GSH ) systems regulate redox signaling involved in various biological events in the CNS . Peroxiredoxins has been widely regarded as H 2 O 2 sca - vengers that partially impede H 2 O 2 - mediated thiol oxidation [ 43 ] . However , given some contexts peroxiredoxins have been postulated as enablers of protein thiol oxidation [ 44 ] . Which of these mechanisms prevails , or has the most signi ﬁ cant impact on redox - signaling , is still an open question [ 45 ] . Intriguingly , Kwon et al . [ 46 ] found that per - oxiredoxin6 ( Prdx6 ) binds to NOXA1 and assembles with the Nox1 complex , supporting Nox1 - mediated migration of colon epithelial cells . Over the last years , peroxiredoxins have been increasingly suggested as key players in H 2 O 2 - mediated signaling [ 45 , 47 ] . As for the case of H 2 O 2 signaling con ﬁ nement via antioxidant systems , Rac1 activity undergoes tight spatiotemporal regulation too ; it has been shown that active Rac1 can exhibit a marked di ﬀ erential spatial distribution in several cellular processes , such as axonal elongation and dendritic spine formation [ 26 , 48 ] . Interestingly , and as pointed out below , spatial regulation of Rac1 activity may be directly linked to H 2 O 2 - dependend redox control . 2 . 3 . Redox regulation of Rac1 via H 2 O 2 - induced fast - cycling activity Alongside GEFs , GAPs and GDIs , it is widely regarded that Rac1 undergoes post - translational modi ﬁ cations that allow ﬁ ne - tuned reg - ulation of its activity and localization [ 5 ] . In fact , mutations in Rac1 ' s regulators are prevalent in some type of cancers such as melanoma [ 49 ] . In addition , up - regulation of Rac1 activity by increased nucleotide cycling induced via oncogenic mutations are well - known [ 50 , 51 ] ; these sort of modi ﬁ cations promote GEF - independent guanine nucleotide exchange activity . Another way of obtaining high GEF - independent guanine nucleotide exchange activity is by cysteine oxidation ; hence Rac1 may be considered as a redox target . The latter is supported by evidence showing that ROS and RNS directly a ﬀ ect Rac1 activity . In this sense , Heo and Campbell , 2005 [ 52 ] show that peroxide increases Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange by 10 - fold . Later , Hobbs et al . [ 53 ] showed that Rac1 - Cys18 may be glutathiolated , which is a reversible oxidative modi ﬁ cation , upon ROS induction in primary chondrocytes from human joints . Importantly , human articular chondrocytes are known for expressing Nox2 and su ﬀ ering elevated levels of ROS during osteoarthritis [ 54 ] . Moreover , isolated glutathiolated Rac1 showed a 200 - fold increase in nucleotide exchange rate in comparison to non - oxidized Rac1 [ 53 ] . Also , a mimicking form of this redox fast - cycling Rac1 generated enhanced lamellipodia formation in Swiss 3T3 cells , while expression of a redox - insensitive Rac1 variant did not show changes in the lamellipodia , whilst increased activity of the mimicking form of Rac1 redox fast - cycling was con ﬁ rmed via pull - down activity assays [ 53 ] . More recently , it has been reported that glutathionylation Fig . 1 . Dual functions of Rac1 . Upstream events involving several signal transduction cascades induce GEFs activity , thus promoting GTP - bound Rac1 formation . Active Rac1 mediates two downstream outcomes : Actin - related and NOX - related events . At the same time , GAPs may favor the GDP - bound state while GDIs hijack inactive Rac1 in the cy - toplasm . RTK , receptor tyrosine kinases . GPCR , G protein - coupled receptor . VEGFR2 , vascular endothelial growth factor 2 . A . Acevedo , C . González - Billault Free Radical Biology and Medicine 116 ( 2018 ) 101 – 113 102 of Rac1 on cysteine 81 and 157 , residues near the nucleotide binding site , inactivate Rac1 in endothelial cells under conditions of diabetes and hyperlipidemia [ 55 ] . Taken together , redox - dependent modulation of nucleotide cycling in Rac1 seems to be a relevant layer of regulation , though it could function either as a promoter or inhibitor of Rac1 ac - tivity . Even though redox signaling and NOX - derived ROS have been shown to play key roles in several neuronal processes [ 56 ] , Rac1 redox regulation via glutathionylation has yet to be explored in neurons . 2 . 4 . Structural aspects involved in Rac1 - mediated ROS - and actin - related events Spatiotemporal regulation of Rac1 activity may cooperate with other systems that control redox events , such as peroxidases , in such a way that multilayered - regulation would be articulated . Structurally , it is not clear how those mechanisms work in concert over Rac1 domains . In this sense , it is well - established that Rac1 interacts with p67phox . Such an interaction requires residues belonging to the N - terminal ( S22 , T25 , N26 , F28 , G30 and E31 residues ) which are near or inside the switch I region , as well as residues from the C - terminal ( A159 , L160 , and Q162 residues ) [ 57 ] . Mutations that lead to constitutively active forms of Rac1 ( Rac1 - G12V and Rac1 - Q61L ) do not a ﬀ ect its function regarding NOX activation and e ﬀ ectively promote NOX activity [ 58 , 59 ] . Other Rac1 domains such as the insert region have been re - garded as not crucial for NOX assembly and activation [ 60 ] . Several Cdc42 - and Rac - interactive binding ( CRIB ) e ﬀ ectors of Rac1 such as PAK , WAVE and the sca ﬀ old IRSp53 , as well as non - CRIB sca ﬀ olding proteins including IQGAP and Sra / CYFIP have been found to interact with the Rac1 N - terminal domain , as does p67phox [ 61 ] . 3 . Rac1 - dependent ROS and actin regulation in neuronal functions NOX - mediated ROS have an important role as physiological mes - sengers . One remarkable example regarding such a function is during axonal formation . In this line , increased p40phox / NOX2 levels and co - localization at growth cone contact sites with apCAM beads and in - teracting growth cones have been observed . Thus apCAM - clustering promotes actin rearrangement and NADPH oxidase activation during neurite outgrowth [ 62 ] . Based on the latter , Munnamalai et al . [ 62 ] proposed that cytosolic NADPH oxidase subunits such as p40 are as - sociated with actin structures in unstimulated growth cones . Here , NOX2 subunits p47phox , p67phox , p40phox , and Rac1 translocate to the plasma membrane ( with or without F - actin ) and activate NOX2 upon growth cone stimulation by external cues . In addition , it has been shown that in order to sustain axonal development , Rac1 is activated via RyR - mediated Ca 2 + release from the ER [ 63 ] . In this mechanism , ER Ca 2 + release promotes Rac1 - activation , which in turn activates NOX2 leading to ROS production . Since RyR activity is promoted by ROS and Ca 2 + [ 64 ] , a feed - forward loop in which activated Rac1 maintains axonal growth and NOX - mediated ROS production was es - tablished [ 63 ] . Notably , this loop could be abrogated by applying NSC23766 , which blocks the interaction of Rac1 with its GEFs Tiam1 and TRIO . Thus ROS production would be sustained in neurons via RyR - mediated Ca 2 + release / GEFs / Rac1 / NOX pathway . 4 . Involvement of Rac1 regulators in redox and actin events 4 . 1 . Rac1 - GEFs involved in NOX - mediated ROS and actin cytoskeleton events Coordination between upstream and downstream e ﬀ ectors may enable localized activation of Rac1 , thus establishing and maintaining actin - related events [ 15 ] and / or focalized NOX - mediated production of ROS [ 65 ] . As the latter relies on GEFs [ 66 ] , the most - characterized Rac1 - GEFs that modulate actin - related functions and NOX - dependent ROS production are discussed below . 4 . 1 . 1 . β PIX The GEF for Rac1 and Cdc42 known as β PIX ( β form of the PAK - interacting exchange factor ; also referred as Cool - 1 or ARHGEF7 ) was ﬁ rst identi ﬁ ed in a search for components directly upstream or down - stream of Cdc42 and Rac1 , being found enriched in focal complexes and necessary for PAK recruitment [ 67 ] . The subcellular localization of β PIX is associated with focal adhesions sites , while tyrosine phos - phorylation of β PIX appears to determine its spatial regulation [ 68 ] . In neurons , β PIX can be found in dendritic spines [ 69 ] , where it may be recruited to synapses by its interaction with the sca ﬀ old Shank [ 70 ] . β PIX has been linked with activity - dependent synaptogenesis [ 71 ] , as well as to dendritic and neurite outgrowth [ 72 , 73 ] . β PIX participates in several pathways downstream of receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) , G protein - coupled receptor ( GPCR ) , integrins and T - cell receptor ( TCR ) [ 74 ] . A relevant feature of β PIX is that it contains a binding domain for GIT1 ( G - protein - coupled receptor kinase - interacting target ; [ 75 ] ) , a GAP for the small GTPase known as Arf ( ADP - ribosylation factor ) [ 76 ] . Together , GIT1 and β PIX function as a module that can be targeted to sca ﬀ old and coordinate Rac1 - mediated actin regulation [ 77 , 78 ] . Focal adhesion establishment is among the best - studied GIT1 / β PIX / Rac1 - mediated events . Targeting the GIT1 / β PIX complex to focal complexes depends on direct binding of GIT1 to paxillin [ 79 ] , an integrin - recruited adaptor protein [ 80 ] . Since β PIX also binds to PAK , which is one of the main downstream e ﬀ ectors for Rac1 , adhesion and protrusion - related processes can be elicited as Rac1 is locally activated via GIT1 / β PIX axis [ 68 , 81 ] . In neurons , the GIT1 / β PIX / Rac1 axis leads to PAK - dependent phosphorylation of the myosin II light chain ( MLC ) , thereby promoting dendritic spine and synapse formation [ 69 ] . Furthermore , it has been shown that maintenance and clustering of surface GABA A receptors are achieved via the GIT1 / β PIX / Rac1 / PAK axis , thus keeping the integrity and strength of inhibitory synapses [ 82 ] . On the other hand , β PIX has been related to NOX - mediated ROS production as the PI3K products PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 enhance β Pix activation to promote Rac1 activity and NOX1 activation [ 83 ] . The stimulation of ROS pro - duction mediated by β Pix has been con ﬁ rmed by Kaito et al . , ( 2014 ) [ 84 ] , who reported that phosphorylation of β Pix positively regulates NOX1 activity . More recently it has been shown that the polarity pro - tein SCRIB may interact with p22phox / β PIX / Rac1 to promote ROS production [ 85 ] . 4 . 1 . 2 . Dock180 This is a speci ﬁ c Rac1 GEF ( 180 - kDa protein downstream of CRK ) that was initially identi ﬁ ed as a binding protein for CRK , a homolog of the oncogene product v - Crk from the CT10 retrovirus able to transform 3T3 ﬁ broblasts [ 86 ] . Usually , GEFs interact with Rho - GTPases through their Dbl homology - pleckstrin homology ( DH - PH ) domain . This is not the case for DOCK180 , which does not contain the DH - PH domain ; instead it interacts with Rac1 by its Docker domain [ 87 ] . In order to achieve an e ﬃ cient activation and localization of Rac1 , DOCK180 forms a complex with the sca ﬀ old protein , ELMO1 ( engulfment and mobility ) [ 88 , 89 ] . Elevated PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 levels that are locally - gen - erated at the leading edge , promote membrane localization of Dock180 / ELMO and polarized activation of Rac1 during elongation and migration in LR73 cells ( a variant of the CHO cell line ) [ 90 ] . Although it has been observed that Dock180 may promote epithelial cell migration [ 88 , 91 ] or even metastasis [ 92 ] , this GEF is known to localize at both integrin - and cadherin - based adhesions sites [ 93 ] . Similarly to β PIX , Dock180 has been localized in dendritic spines along with its inter - acting partners RhoG and ELMO1 , where Dock180 promotes spine morphogenesis [ 94 ] . Furthermore , roles of Dock180 in axonal guidance and pruning have been reported [ 95 , 96 ] . Interestingly , there is some evidence indicating that ELMO1 / Dock180 can promote NOX - mediated ROS production . It has been reported that the brain - speci ﬁ c angio - genesis inhibitor 1 ( BAI1 ) directly interacts with ELMO1 / Dock180 , and A . Acevedo , C . González - Billault Free Radical Biology and Medicine 116 ( 2018 ) 101 – 113 103 together they activate Rac1 [ 97 , 98 ] . In this sense , Billings et al . [ 65 ] reported that BAI1 promotes NOX2 activation via ELMO1 / Dock180 – - mediated Rac1 activation in macrophages . 4 . 1 . 3 . Vav Named after the sixth letter of the Hebrew alphabet , Vav was ﬁ rst characterized as an oncogene responsible for tumorigenesis in nude mice injected with NIH3T3 cells transfected with DNA from human esophageal carcinomas [ 99 ] . Vav is a GEF of Rac1 , RhoA and Cdc42 , and functions downstream of GPCR and phosphorylation via Src and Syk tyrosine kinases that release Vav from its auto - inhibitory con - formation [ 100 ] . It has been shown that Vav3 localizes to membrane rafts in immune cells [ 101 ] , while Vav1 locally promotes cytoskeletal rearrangements that take place in the peripheral area of immunological synapses [ 102 ] . Also , Vav1 is localized at lamellipodia of pancreatic tumor cells where it promotes Rac1 - mediated invasive migration [ 103 ] . Vav2 and Vav3 are known to regulate neurite outgrowth and branching , axon guidance and the collapse of the growth cone [ 104 , 105 ] . Moreover , Vav2 and Vav3 are essential for theta - induced LTP and spine enlargement [ 106 ] . It has been proposed that targeting of Vav to di ﬀ erent downstream pathways may rely on the regulation of multiple phosphorylation steps [ 107 ] . Vav2 functions as a mediator of growth factors and mechano - transduction , with well - known roles in cell - cell adhesion , migration and angiogenesis [ 108 , 109 ] . On the other hand , Vav1 is particularly expressed in hematopoietic tissues , and plays key roles in lymphocyte development and function [ 110 ] . Vav1 is es - sential for T - cell receptor ( TCR ) - mediated cytoskeletal reorganization [ 110 , 111 ] . Importantly , Vav1 and PI3K are linked , as PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 enhances phosphorylation and activation of Vav1 by Lck [ 112 ] and promotes its recruitment to the plasma membrane [ 113 ] . Regarding NOX - related events , Price et al . [ 114 ] showed in COS phox cells that stimulation of endogenous Rac1 by expressing of a constitutively active form of Vav1 highly activates NOX2 . In the same study , increased levels of Rac1 - GTP and ROS were observed when expressing constitutively active forms of Vav2 or Tiam1 ; however Vav1 induced the highest ROS production . Also , by using COS phox and human neutrophils treated with fMLP , Ming et al . [ 115 ] showed that there is a direct interaction be - tween p67 phox and Vav1 . This interaction activates Rac2 to a greater extent than Rac1 , which in turn enhances the interaction between p67 phox and Vav1 . Interestingly , this study also shows that the inter - actions between p67 phox , Vav1 , and Rac and subsequent Rac activation are not associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 . In such a way , a phosphorylation - independent mechanism could be con - sidered as a mediator to the di ﬀ erent downstream targets of the Vav1 / Rac axis . In addition , a positive regulation of NADPH oxidase activity through p47 Phox phosphorylation exerted by PAK1 via Vav1 - dependent Rac1 activation has been found in microglia upon fMLP stimulation [ 116 ] . Also , based on molecular modeling and some experimental evidence , Armstrong et al . [ 117 ] proposed that Vav1 along with p67 phox , p40 phox and Rac1 forms a quaternary complex to activate NADPH oxidase - mediated ROS production . 4 . 1 . 4 . Tiam1 The Rac1 - GEF known as Tiam1 ( T - lymphoma invasion and metas - tasis 1 ) was originally identi ﬁ ed as an invasion - inducing gene in the context of proviral insertional mutagenesis assays [ 118 ] . Tiam1 has been linked to the formation of cell - cell adhesions mediated by cad - herin and cell migration suppression , while disassembly of cell - cell adhesions mediated by downregulation of Tiam1 may promote cell migration [ 119 , 120 ] . Membrane translocation of Tiam1 is crucial for its capacity to induce Rac1 - mediated e ﬀ ects such as actin - related events and NOX - derived ROS generation [ 121 , 122 ] . Tiam1 has been related to several events located at membrane ru ﬄ es and others ( Tiam1 sub - cellular locations have been reviewed by Boissier et al . [ 123 ] ) . In neurons , Tiam1 is involved in the formation of dendritic spines , being highly enriched at the post - synaptic density [ 124 ] . Also , as Rac1 - mediated actin events are crucial to ensure proper function of dendritic spines [ 125 ] , the Tiam1 / Rac1 axis has key roles in synaptic plasticity [ 126 ] . Importantly , Tiam1 / Rac1 - mediated actin dynamics at dendritic spines may be modulated via calcium - dependent phosphorylation of Tiam1 [ 127 ] . Tiam1 - mediated activation of Rac1 has been linked with lowered cell scattering upon induction with hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) and EGF [ 128 ] . It has been show that expression of wild - type Tiam1 promotes E - cadherin localization at cell - cell contacts , in a pro - cess that is likely to be mediated by the interaction of Tiam1 and Rac1 with the Ras GTPase - activating - like protein 1 ( IQGAP1 ) [ 128 , 129 ] . In contrast , upon integrin - induced signaling , Tiam1 , probably in associa - tion with PAR3 and PKC ζ , may promote Rac activation , cell migration and tumor invasion [ 130 , 131 ] . Besides , Tiam1 has also been linked to NOX - mediated ROS production . In this sense , Price et al . 114 ] showed that activation of endogenous Rac1 by expression of a constitutively - active form of Tiam1 activates NADPH oxidase in COS phox cells . Ad - ditionally , at the initial stages of diabetes the Tiam1 - Rac1 - NOX2 axis leads to increased intracellular ROS [ 122 ] . Remarkably , a signi ﬁ cant interaction between Vav2 and Tiam1 has been reported in endothelial cells undergoing shear stress . In this study , Liu et al . [ 132 ] showed that Vav2 conducts Rac1 loading of GTP while Tiam1 acts as a sca ﬀ old linking Rac1 to the ﬂ ow - sensitive polarity complex Par3 / VE - cadherin and to the NADPH oxidase , thus favoring ﬂ ow - dependent ROS pro - duction . 4 . 1 . 5 . P - Rex The PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - dependent Rac exchanger 1 or P - Rex was ﬁ rst puri ﬁ ed from neutrophil cytosol and identi ﬁ ed as a factor able to ac - tivate Rac via PIP3 stimulation ; it was thus originally linked to ROS production [ 133 ] . This GEF locates at membranes at GPCR and PI3K - mediated signaling microdomains ; the sub - cellular localization of P - Rex1 has been recently reviewed by Welch et al . [ 134 ] . In neurons , P - Rex1 localizes at neurite shafts , distal tips and at the growth cone [ 135 , 136 ] . The P - Rex family are Rac1 - GEFs activated by PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and by the G βγ subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein complex linked to G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCR ) . Accordingly , it has been suggested that P - Rex acts as a “ coincidence detector ” for both signals [ 137 ] . The gelsolin protein superfamily member , ﬂ ightless - 1 homolog ( FLII ) has been recently identi ﬁ ed as an interacting partner for Rac1 and P - Rex [ 128 ] . FLII is pivotal for actin cytoskeleton events , regulating capping in actin barbed - ends and severing [ 138 , 139 ] . Marei et al . [ 128 ] reported that FLII binds to active Rac1 , thus serving as a sca ﬀ olding protein for P - Rex1 which in turn enhances the interaction of Rac1 with FLII . Together , this promotes P - Rex1 / Rac1 - driven cell migration [ 140 ] . As can be appreciated , Rac1 activation by Tiam1 or P - Rex1 may yield opposing actin - related outcomes ; suppression or promotion of migra - tion , respectively . This has been proposed by Marei et al . [ 128 ] who reported that activation of Rac1 by Tiam1 or P - Rex1 results in distinct actin rearrangements , each one leading to di ﬀ erent phenotypes . Fur - ther , there is considerable evidence showing that P - Rex regulates NOX - mediated ROS . For instance , a di ﬀ erentiated human pro - myeloytic cell line treated with P - Rex1 antisense oligonucleotide has reduced C5a - stimulated ROS production [ 133 ] . Also , in a study on neutrophils from P - Rex1 knockout mice , it was found that disruption of P - Rex1 impairs Rac2 activation and ROS production upon fMLP exposure [ 141 ] . In a similar study done in mouse neutrophils , it was found that P - Rex1 co - operates with Vav1 during fMLF - stimulated ROS production ; in fact , mice lacking both P - Rex1 and Vav1 showed severe reduction in Rac1 and Rac2 activities [ 142 ] . Moreover , Nie et al . [ 143 ] reported that P - Rex1 expression mediates fMLP - stimulated ROS generation in COS phox . They also observed that superoxide generation is further enhanced by expression of PKC δ and by overexpression of Akt . Consistently , it has been proposed that the assembly of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex via GPCR / PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 / P - Rex also involves PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - mediated phosphorylation of p40phox and p47phox through Akt and PKC δ activity [ 144 ] . A . Acevedo , C . González - Billault Free Radical Biology and Medicine 116 ( 2018 ) 101 – 113 104 Table 1 highlights the main ﬁ ndings regarding the GEFs - controlled dual function of Rac1 . 4 . 2 . Redox control of GEF - dependent Rac1 regulation In a further line of evidence , Src family kinases are well - known regulators of actin cytoskeleton re - arrangements upon cell adhesion and migration [ 145 ] , and ROS - dependent activation of Src is crucial for cell adhesion [ 146 ] . In fact , Src activation and hence actin - related events such as adhesion may be suppressed via antioxidant - mediated ROS removal [ 147 ] . Rac1 activity may be regulated by Src - dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2 and Tiam1 [ 148 ] . In this sense , Gianni et al . [ 149 ] demonstrated in human HT29 colonic adenocarci - noma cells that c - Src promotes Rac1 - mediated ROS ( in NOX1 ) by in - creasing the levels of active Rac1 through the activation of Vav2 by tyrosine phosphorylation ; this mechanism did not depend on Tiam1 . Interestingly , transfection with a constitutively active form of Src pro - motes NOX1 - dependent ROS production in HT29 cells [ 149 ] . 4 . 3 . RhoGDIs involved in Rac1 - mediated ROS production and actin events Rac1 dissociation from the RhoGDI - Rac1 complex has been in - vestigated during Fc γ R - mediated phagocytosis . Here , Rac1 is translo - cated to the phagosomes as a RhoGDI1 ( or RhoGDI2 ) - Rac1 complex , concomitant with ROS production [ 22 ] . Regarding dissociating me - chanisms , Griner et al . , ( 2013 ) [ 150 ] reported inactivation of RhoGDI2 via PKC α phosphorylation of Ser 31 in a region that contacts Rac1 in response to phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate stimulation in HEK 293 T cells , thus promoting translocation of active Rac1 and suggesting that PKC α may be pro - tumorigenic . It has been shown that increases in in - tracellular Ca 2 + and subsequent activation of PKC α generates serine phosphorylation in RhoGDI α , thus inducing membrane translocation and Tiam1 - induced activation of Rac1 . This leads to cytoskeletal re - arrangement in NIH / 3T3 Fibroblasts and PC3 ( human prostate cancer line ) cells [ 151 ] . On the other hand , PKC α phosphorylation on RhoGDI α at Serine 96 releases Rac1 to mediate apical amylase secre - tion upon cholecystokinin - stimulated pancreatic acini cells [ 152 ] . The e ﬀ ect of other post - translational modi ﬁ cations over RhoGDI such as lysine acetylation [ 153 ] on Rac1 activity and possible interactions be - tween RhoGDI with unprenylated Rac1 have yet to be determined . Also , it is well - established in macrophages that Rac1 - dependent ROS pro - duction is regulated via RhoGDI α . In this line , the dissociation of the cytoplasmic complex RhoGDI α - Rac1 - GDP and subsequent membrane localization of GTP - Rac1 is crucial to activate NOX2 [ 19 ] . In neurons , it has been observed that RhoGDI α is necessary for the maintenance of mature - mushroom - shaped spines in rat hippocampal neurons ; however , the precise RhoGDI α - mediated mechanisms were not investigated [ 48 ] . 4 . 4 . GAPs involved in Rac1 - mediated ROS production and actin events GAPs have also been linked to NOX - derived ROS production . In this sense , neutrophils from mice de ﬁ cient in the breakpoint cluster region protein ( BRC ) , a GAP acting on Rac1 , showed high increased O 2 - pro - duction upon stimulation by PMA and Fmlf [ 154 ] . Of note , BCR has been found to be involved in spine formation limitation and to interact with PSD - 95 [ 155 , 156 ] . Among well - studied GAPs having roles in neuronal functions is srGAP3 that interacts with Slit / Robo and is re - quired for Rac1 - mediated neurite outgrowth , spine formation and plasticity [ 157 , 158 ] . Some evidence suggests that srGAP3 might be related to NOX activity since Ozer et al . [ 159 ] found that cDNA srGAP3 is down - regulated by 1 . 5 fold during NOX - derived ROS mediated oxi - dative stress in apoptotic cell death induced by inhibitors of TYMS , a crucial enzyme regarding cancer - related cell proliferation . 4 . 5 . NOX - dependent regulation of protein tyrosine phosphatases , RhoGDI and p190Rho - GAP Protein tyrosine phosphatases ( PTPs ) have key roles in actin - related events such as cell adhesion and migration and their activity may be controlled via localized redox inactivation [ 160 ] . Redox - dependent regulation of PTPs , particularly in low - molecular - weight protein tyr - osine phosphatase ( LMW - PTP ) , brings together Rac1 and Rho regula - tion through a redox - mediated axis . In this sense , Nimmual et al . [ 161 ] demonstrated that Rac - dependent ROS production leads to the inhibi - tion of the LMW - PTP and a subsequent increase in tyrosine phosphor - ylation and activation of p190Rho - GAP , thus decreasing Rho activity . The latter event was required for cell - spreading mediated by integrins , and formation of membrane ru ﬄ es [ 161 ] . Furthermore , PTPs with proline - glutamine - serine - threonine - rich motifs ( PTP - PEST ) show loca - lized ROS - induced inactivation via recruitment of the NADPH oxidase ( NOX ) subunit p47phox to focal complexes during endothelial cell migration [ 162 ] . Oxidative inactivation of PTP - PEST has also been linked to NOX1 - derived ROS in the context of mucosal wound repair [ 163 ] . More recently , Lee et al . [ 164 ] demonstrated that integrin - bound PTP - PEST dephosphorylates RhoGDI1 promoting its release from the membrane and the subsequent formation of RhoGDI1 - Rac1 complexes in the cytoplasm . Conversely , the same study showed that translocation of Src - phosphorylated RhoGDI1 to the leading edge promotes local activation of Rac1 [ 164 ] . Taken together , NOX - mediated ROS might promote RhoGDI1 - Rac1 dissociation via PTP - PEST inactivation , thus augmenting Rac1 activity locally .

González - Billault Free Radical Biology and Medicine 116 ( 2018 ) 101 – 113 105 5 . Crosstalk between actin and ROS - related events mediated by Rac1 In the following section , evidence concerning Rac1 - mediated cross - talking phenomena is addressed , focusing on cellular functions and dysfunctions where the dual function of Rac1 might play a key role . 5 . 1 . Crosstalk events regulated by the HACE1 / Rac1 axis Crosstalk between events related to the actin cytoskeleton and Rac1 - mediated ROS production can be found in studies focusing on Rac1 degradation by the ubiquitin - proteasome system ( UPS ) [ 165 , 166 ] . In this sense , by using MDCKII cells and hepatocyte growth factor treat - ment , Castillo - Lluva et al . [ 167 ] found that HACE1 ( HECT domain and Ankyrin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin - protein ligase 1 ) antagonizes migration via poly - ubiquitylation of active Rac1 and subsequent UPS degradation . Indeed , HACE1 selectively targets membrane - associated Rac1 , thus decreasing migration . Conversely , marked accumulation of actin and Rac1 at the leading edge , as well as increased duration of migration are observed when the HACE1 - mediated degradation of ac - tive Rac1 is disrupted [ 167 ] . In another study , Goka and Lippman [ 168 ] showed that HACE1 de ﬁ ciency results in the accumulation of activated Rac1 enhancing migration and invasion as well as anchorage - in - dependent growth in the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF12A . Furthermore , the same study reported that strong tumorigenic trans - formation is observed when knocking - down HACE1 and overexpressing HER2 / neu , a well - established activator of several Rac1 GEFs in breast cancer [ 66 , 169 ] . Therefore , Rac1 degradation via HACE1 is linked to actin - related events , such as cell mobility . Besides actin - related events , there is strong evidence showing that the HACE1 - Rac1 axis also parti - cipates in NOX - mediated ROS production . In this respect , Daugaard et al . [ 170 ] showed in - vitro and in - vivo that HACE1 activity correlates with NOX - mediated ROS levels , while the underlying mechanism is direct targeting of active Rac1 bound to the subunit NOXA1 . Thereby , they demonstrated that the ubiquitylation and degradation of Rac1 mediated by HACE1 is directly - related to NOX - mediated ROS produc - tion . Although NOX2 may also be involved , this aspect was not in - vestigated further [ 170 ] . Supporting the latter , Centibas et al . [ 171 ] discovered that Hace - / - MEF cells undergo ROS - induced cell death upon glutamine starvation . In fact , the ROS - induced cell death of Hace - / - MEFs was mediated by Rac1 and NOX activation [ 171 ] . In summary , these studies clearly show that Rac1 displays a dual function mediated by the HACE1 - Rac1 axis . On the other hand , there is some evidence suggesting that the HACE1 / Rac1 axis might be involved in neuronal development and degeneration . In this way , Hollstein et al . [ 172 ] identi ﬁ ed loss of function mutations in HACE1 leading to autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorders associated to intellectual dis - ability , spasticity , and abnormal gait . Also , there is evidence of in - creased oxidative stress in striatal regions of the brain of Hace1 KO mice , whereas HACE1 ectopic expression correlates with neuroprotec - tion against oxidative stress in striatal neuronal progenitor cells [ 173 ] . The same study also reports decreased HACE1 levels in the striatum of postmortem patients with Huntington ' s disease . Though the authors of the latter study highlight the role of the transcription factor Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2 - related Factor ( NRF2 ) , the role of Rac1 may be re - levant . Another line of evidence allows relating actin cytoskeleton and Rac1 - mediated ROS through RHO inhibition - induced migration . Rounded - amoeboid melanoma cells , which are characterized by high RHO - ROCK - actomyosin activity , present mechanisms for rapid migra - tion via inhibiting Rac1 - mediated cell adhesion [ 174 ] . Notably , Herraiz et al . [ 175 ] observed that increased Rac1 activity along with ROS levels inversely correlate with RHO - ROCK actomyosin activity in melanoma cells . Moreover , they obtained a highly invasive phenotype by applying antioxidant treatments that increased actomyosin contractility . 5 . 2 . Crosstalk events related to cell adhesion and polarity In endothelial cells ( ECs ) , mechanosensing - induced activation of Rac1 at cell - cell junctions is essential for aligning actin stress ﬁ bers in response to ﬂ uid shear stress [ 176 ] . The mechanosensory complex in - volved in this process consists of the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( PECAM - 1 ) , vascular endothelial cadherin ( VE - cadherin ) , and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) [ 177 ] . An interesting feature of this complex is that PECAM - 1 transduces me - chanical signals via Src - mediated phosphorylation of Vav2 , Rac1 acti - vation and localized NOX - activation , where the latter is mediated by a complex composed of Tiam1 , VE - cadherin , p67phox and Par3 [ 132 ] . Hence , Rac1 - mediated ROS production downstream of Vav2 is linked with cell - adhesion and polarity . A similar mechanism can be found in neurons where the interaction of L1 adhesion molecule and b1 integrins generates Src - dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2 , and sub - sequent activation of Rac1 , Pak1 , MEK , and the MAP kinases ERK [ 178 ] . This is essential for neuronal migration , axonal growth and guidance , as well as for process branching during development [ 105 , 179 ] . It remains to be investigated whether or not this process involves Rac1 - mediated ROS production . Further evidence showing that Rac1 is key during axonal formation comes from a feedback loop with PI3K . In this mechanism , Rac1 is activated by the speci ﬁ c Rac1 - GEFs , Tiam1 and STEF / Tiam2 [ 180 , 181 ] . In turn , these GEFs are in - duced by their interaction with the polarity protein Par3 associated with Par6 and the atypical Protein Kinase C ( aPKC ) , while this inter - action is promoted via PI3K - induced Cdc42 activation [ 182 , 183 ] . As activated Rac1 can bind PI3K [ 184 ] , and PIP3 can recruit Vav2 to ac - tivate Rac1 [ 185 ] , a positive - feedback loop promoting Rac1 - mediated actin ﬁ lament reorganization may be established during neuronal po - larization [ 186 , 187 ] . In this context , the Rac1 - PI3K feedback loop could signal via the Sra - 1 / WAVE1 complex [ 188 ] and PAK - mediated phos - phorylation of Shootin1 [ 189 ] . It has been observed in epithelial cells that the apical polarity complex Crumbs ( Crb ) breaks a similar Rac1 - PI3K positive - feedback loop , thereby repressing the activation of Rac1 as well as PI3K signaling at the apical membrane , whereas the Rac1 - PI3K loop restricts Crb function [ 190 ] . Notably , Crb can also repress NADPH oxidase - dependent superoxide production in epithelia via Crb - dependent inhibition of Rac1 [ 191 ] . Conversely , the same study re - ported that loss of the inhibitory function of Crb results in NOX - medi - ated ROS overproduction . Taken together , studies on Rac1 - PI3K posi - tive - feedback in neuronal polarity and its Crb - dependent inhibition in epithelia suggest that Rac1 can display both ROS - and actin - related functions in tight association with polarity - related e ﬀ ectors . All cross - talk events described so far in this section are summarized in Fig . 2 . Furthermore , sca ﬀ olding events conducted by the polarity protein Scrib also suggest crosstalk between ROS - and actin - related Rac1 outcomes . The GIT1 / β PIX / Rac1 axis is involved in several polarity events due to the interaction between β PIX and Scrib [ 192 ] . In this line , it has been shown that Scrib is crucial to activate and localize Rac1 at the leading edge upon directed epithelial migration in MCF10A mammary cells [ 193 ] . Also , Nola et al . [ 194 ] reported that Rac1 - mediated PAK acti - vation at the leading edge of migrating MEF cells depends on the Scribble / β PIX / GIT1 axis . On the other hand , Zhan et al . [ 195 ] observed that in order to maintain mammary epithelial polarity , Scrib locally promotes Rac1 activation at cell - cell junctions , suggesting that the GIT1 / β PIX complex and Scribble may be interacting in such an event . Additionally , Boczonadi et al . [ 196 ] showed that Scrib assembles with β PIX and Rac1 to regulate junctional complexes in cardiomyocytes . Remarkably , Zheng et al . [ 85 ] recently reported a direct interaction between Scrib and the NADPH oxidase subunit p22phox , whereby Scrib acts as a sca ﬀ old recruiting β Pix to induce Rac1 - mediated ROS pro - duction in macrophages . Interestingly , they found that Scrib also binds to NOXO1 ( subunit of NOX1 ) , thereby showing an extended role for the Scrib / β Pix / Rac1 axis regarding NOX - mediated ROS production . In neurons , Scrib may promote Rac1 / PAK - regulated actin polymerization A . Acevedo , C . González - Billault Free Radical Biology and Medicine 116 ( 2018 ) 101 – 113 106 during dendritic spine formation by interacting with the neuronal nitric oxide synthase adaptor protein ( NOS1AP ) and β PIX / GIT1 [ 197 ] . Also , it has been suggested that Scrib directs cytoskeleton elongation during neurite outgrowth mediated by nerve growth factor in PC12 cells ; here , membrane - located Scrib forms a complex with β PIX , Rac1 , HRas and ERK1 / 2 [ 198 ] . Interestingly , Scrib and Rac1 are crucial in the process known as active forgetting in the mushroom body neurons of Drosophila [ 199 ] . In this study , a direct interaction between Scrib , Rac1 , PAK3 and co ﬁ lin was found to promote active forgetting downstream of dopa - minergic signaling . More recently , Liu et al . [ 200 ] con ﬁ rmed in mice that Rac1 activity favors active forgetting while Rac1 inactivation promotes memory retention . These and other studies strongly suggest that active forgetting heavily relies on Rac1 - mediated actin regulation [ 201 , 202 ] . A possible sca ﬀ olding role for Scrib regarding Rac1 - medi - ated ROS production in neuronal functions has yet to be investigated . 6 . Crosstalk between redox and sca ﬀ olding events in Rac1 - dependent actin regulation 6 . 1 . Key sca ﬀ olding events in Rac1 - mediated actin cytoskeleton regulation There is strong evidence showing that Rac1 - mediated actin events are tightly - regulated by sca ﬀ olding interactions . This fact contrasts with what it is known about Rac1 - mediated ROS production , which does not appear to rely on sca ﬀ olding proteins . As sca ﬀ olding interac - tions would be the way by which Rac1 outcomes might be selected , such events are discussed in the following sections . Of note , and as discussed later , redox protein modi ﬁ cation of sca ﬀ olds indicates crosstalk between the two Rac1 - mediated outcomes . Rac1 - mediated actin regulation requires sca ﬀ olding events to take place , as shown by the fact that interaction between Tiam1 and the Arp2 / 3 complex links activation of Rac1 to actin polymerization [ 203 ] , and Sra - 1 and Nap1 link Rac1 to actin assembly thus driving lamellipodia formation [ 204 ] . Another well - studied sca ﬀ olding protein that spatially restricts Rac1 activity is QGAP1 , that binds and crosslinks actin ﬁ laments , while ac - tive Rac1 promotes the oligomerization of IQGAP1 [ 205 , 206 ] . More - over , IQGAP1 can enhance actin polymerization by interacting with ( Arp ) 2 / 3 [ 207 ] . Another case of ﬁ ne modulation of Rac1 activity is provided by the Tiam1 interacting proteins spinophilin and insulin re - ceptor substrate protein 53 kDa ( IRSp53 ) [ 208 ] . In this study , Raja - gopal et al . , [ 208 ] showed in ﬁ broblasts that Tiam1 - dependent Rac1 activation may be mediated by IRSp53 or spinophilin , depending on the sort of upstream signaling ; in fact each sca ﬀ old may lead to totally di ﬀ erent independent events such as IRSp53 / Tiam1 / Rac1 - dependent adhesion or spinophillin / Tiam1 / Rac1 - dependent migration . Rajagopal et al . [ 208 ] suggested that the interaction between Tiam1 and distinct sca ﬀ olding proteins allows the selection of speci ﬁ c Rac1 - dependent outcomes . 6 . 2 . Actin cytoskeleton sca ﬀ olding involves redox regulation It is well - documented that actin itself and some of its regulators undergo reversible cysteine oxidation ( speci ﬁ c modi ﬁ cations have been recently reviewed by Xu et al . [ 209 ] ) . Several lines of evidence suggest that actin polymerization is increased or decreased depending on the speci ﬁ c cysteine residue that is oxidized , cell type and experimental settings [ 209 ] . Also , it has been proposed that thiol oxidation , and hence H 2 O 2 - mediated signaling , plays a pivotal role in actin events related to cell migration [ 210 ] , neuronal development [ 56 , 63 , 211 , 212 ] and synaptic plasticity [ 213 , 214 ] . Considering that Rac1 is directly involved in ROS production , it is interesting to note that some of the Rac1 - related e ﬀ ectors that modulate the actin cytoskeleton undergo hydrogen peroxide - inducible redox modi ﬁ cations , namely cysteine oxidation . Remarkable evidence of crosstalk between Rac1 - mediated ROS - and actin - related events stems from the redox control of IQGAP . It has been reported that cysteine oxidation of IQGAP residues co - loca - lizes with p47phox and F - actin at the leading edge during migration in endothelial cells [ 215 ] . 7 . Deregulated Rac1 activation in neurodegeneration It has been reported that ﬁ brillar amyloid - beta peptide , which is observed in AD , promotes increased Rac1 activity via Tiam1 activation by a Ca 2 + - dependent mechanism , this phenomenon also involves en - hanced actin polymerization [ 216 ] . Here , amyloid beta mediates Rac1 activation through phosphorylation and translocation of Tiam1 ; in fact , Fibrillar A1 - 42 induced a signi ﬁ cant increase ( 1 . 5 - fold ) in the level of Thr phosphorylation of Tiam1 . Calcium - dependent PKC activity was responsible for Tiam1 phosphorylation . Therefore , upon amyloid beta exposure , Rac1 is over - activated by Ca 2 + signaling ( conventional PKC activity ) that promotes Tiam1 activation and its translocation to the membrane [ 217 ] . A link between actin dynamics and ROS production upon amyloid beta exposure has been proposed by Tsoy et al . [ 218 ] , whom by using immortalized cerebral endothelial cells ( bEnd3 ) ob - served that A β 42 promoted ROS production by up to 83 % after 60 min of treatment . They also demonstrated that A β 42 favored actin poly - merization , while pretreatment with the antioxidant N - acetylcysteine ( NAC ) suppressed A β - induced actin polymerization and cytoskeletal rearrangement [ 218 ] . Manterola et al . [ 219 ] also found a positive correlation between A β 42 exposure and Rac1 activation in SN4741 cells ( a line originated from substantia nigra dopaminergic cells derived from transgenic mouse embryos ) , primary embryonic cortical neurons from rats and in neuronal organotypic cultures of the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex . They observed that A β 1 – 42 peptide stimulates the Rac1 pathway through Tiam - 1 phosphorylation by novel PKCs . These kinases are not calcium dependent . Similarly , in a mice model of the Fragile X syndrome , characterized by thin , long and immature high Fig . 2 . Signaling pathways involving actin - related and NOX - re - lated outcomes . Upstream signals mediated by GEFs converge at Rac1 , while GTP - bound Rac1 binds to e ﬀ ectors leading to ROS production ( p67phox and NOXA1 ) and actin dynamics regulation ( PAKs and WAVEs ) . Upstream from Rac1 , negative - regulation is exerted by the Crumbs complex ( Crb ) , whereas downstream ne - gative - regulation is conducted by HACE1 . GPCR , G protein cou - pled receptor .

González - Billault Free Radical Biology and Medicine 116 ( 2018 ) 101 – 113 107 density dendritic spines , Bongmba et al . [ 220 ] found that Rac1 is over - activated in the mouse brain . It has been observed that NOX2 - derived ROS is locally produced at synapses and that NOX2 has a post - synaptic localization [ 214 , 221 , 222 ] . Remarkably , Abdel - Rahman et al . [ 223 ] showed that NOX2 rather than the mitochondria is the major source of synaptic ROS in forebrain synaptosomes from mice . Therefore , it might be possible that neurodegenerative hyper - activation of Rac1 could be inducing deregulated NOX activation . 8 . Concluding remarks Rac1 o ﬀ ers a remarkable example on convergence between sig - naling pathways leading to actin modi ﬁ cation and ROS production . These two seemingly independent cellular events should not be un - derstood as separate entities since their co - occurrence and crosstalk are present in several cellular functions . This is evidenced by the redox susceptibility of some actin regulators and Rac1 itself , where redox - modi ﬁ ed fast - cycling form of Rac1 has proved to a ﬀ ect actin dynamics . In the case of neuronal functions , over the past years it has become evident that Rac1 outcomes co - occur in order to conduct processes such as neuronal polarization . It can be considered that crosstalk between actin - and NOX - related events is facilitated by the fact that both have a common regulator ; Rac1 . Sharing such a common axis allows integra - tion of several upstream signaling pathways . Also , since ROS - produc - tion and redox modi ﬁ cations are involved , rapid , short - lived and re - versible events can take place . Furthermore , as Rho - GTPase regulators and sca ﬀ old proteins play key roles , ﬁ ne - tuned coordination is achieved . Future research should focus on how redox cycles , binary switches and sca ﬀ olds work in concert to give rise to such an agile , integrated and coordinated network . In this sense , it would be helpful to clarify to what extent Rac1 - mediated ROS a ﬀ ects the functions of Rho - GTPase , actin regulators and their crosstalk , thus evaluating the net e ﬀ ect of redox events . Furthermore , comparing the e ﬀ ect of redox - driven modulation of Rac1 against other post - translational modi ﬁ ca - tions is also needed . Novel regulatory loops might be discovered once those phenomena were better characterized . It is worth noting that sca ﬀ olding events are observed both in actin - and NADPH oxidase - re - lated downstream outcomes . In addition , some cellular functions and dysfunctions that show crosstalk between actin regulation and ROS production are related to direct regulation of Rac1 levels , for example , HACE1 - mediated Rac1 degradation . Taken together , dual function of Rac1 relies substantially on interacting patterns and multi - layered regulation . Such features need to be explored to understand complex cellular functions that require coordinated dynamic interplay between actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and ROS production .
