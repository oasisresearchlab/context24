Two populations of CCPs are detected 14 within the same cell : ‘productive’ CCPs that invaginate and pinch oﬀ , forming clathrin - coated vesicles 15 ( CCVs ) [ 1 , 2 ] , and ‘abortive’ CCPs [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] that prematurely disassemble . The mechanisms of gating 16 between these two populations and their relations to the functions of dozens of early - acting endocytic 17 accessory proteins ( EAPs ) [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ] have remained elusive . Here , we use experimentally - guided 18 modeling to integrate the clathrin machinery and membrane mechanics in a single dynamical system . 19 We show that the split between the two populations is an emergent property of this system , in which 20 a switch between an Open state and a Closed state follows from the competition between the chemical 21 energy of the clathrin basket and the mechanical energy of membrane bending . In silico experiments 22 revealed an abrupt transition between the two states that acutely depends on the strength of the clathrin 23 basket . This critical strength is lowered by membrane - bending EAPs [ 10 , 11 , 12 ] . Thus , CME is poised 24 to be shifted between abortive and productive events by small changes in membrane curvature and / or 25 coat stability . This model clariﬁes the workings of a putative endocytic checkpoint whose existence was 26 previously proposed based on statistical analyses of the lifetime distributions of CCPs [ 4 , 13 ] . Overall , 27 a mechanistic framework is established to elucidate the diverse and redundant functions of EAPs in 28 regulating CME progression . 29 Main 30 Cells engulf cargo mainly via clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , which occurs when nascent clathrin - 31 coated pits ( CCPs ) evolve into clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) [ 1 , 2 , 14 ] ( Fig . 1A ) . Biochemical analyses of 32 CME have identiﬁed numerous and diverse endocytic accessory proteins ( EAPs ) implicated in this progression 33 [ 6 , 7 , 15 ] , as well as their interactions [ 16 , 17 , 18 ] , and temporal appearances [ 5 , 19 ] . The process of CME is 34 mechanically demanding as it involves the generation of small vesicles from a ﬂat cell surface . The mechanical 35 demands are met by suﬃcient chemical energy derived from assembling clathrin coats [ 20 ] and association 36 of membrane curvature - generating EAPs [ 21 , 22 ] . Indeed , a notably high proportion of CCPs , referred to as 37 abortive pits [ 3 ] , fail to progress towards productive , cargo - loaded CCPs . Based on statistical and kinetic 38 arguments , previous studies have proposed that turnover of abortive CCPs vs . maturation of productive 39 CCPs is gated by a regulatory mechanism , referred to as the endocytic checkpoint [ 4 , 13 ] ( Fig . 1A ) . 40 The activities of multiple EAPs impinge on the endocytic checkpoint [ 2 , 9 , 23 ] . Yet , in systematic screens , 41 knockdown of most EAPs yield mild or undetectable eﬀects on CME [ 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 ] , and multiple EAPs have 42 overlapping phenotypes even under sensitive and comprehensive imaging [ 9 ] . Indeed , measurements of the 43 1 eﬀect of EAP knockdown on CME did not correlate with their eﬀects on CCP maturation [ 28 ] . Moreover , 44 CME persists in cells expressing a truncated mutant of adaptor protein complex 2 ( AP2 ) deﬁcient in EAP 45 recruitment , yet these cells exhibit dramatically increased numbers of abortive CCPs that fail to gain curva - 46 ture , despite signiﬁcant clathrin assembly [ 13 ] . These data establish the resilience of CME and suggest the 47 functional redundancy of EAPs . Given this , biochemistry - based approaches alone are insuﬃcient to reveal the 48 regulatory mechanism governing CME progression . Thus , while the recruitment of EAPs and the acquisition 49 of curvature appears to play a role in passing the endocytic checkpoint , the actual gating mechanism has 50 remained elusive . 51 Other studies have pursued the mechanical aspects of CME by inferring the strengths of clathrin coats 52 on the plasma membrane [ 29 ] and puriﬁed clathrin baskets [ 30 ] from structural studies , as well as from 53 changes in membrane morphology [ 31 ] , the spatial distributions of EAPs at CCPs [ 32 ] , and the elasticity 54 of the clathrin baskets [ 33 ] . However , these data have yet to be integrated with the known biochemistry 55 to deﬁne the endocytic checkpoint and to clarify the conditions of CCP progression . To do so will require 56 quantifying and understanding membrane mechanics , biochemistry , and the interplay between the two in 57 one dynamical system . A data - driven mechanochemically explicit model that includes membrane , clathrin , 58 and EAP components is poised to ﬁll this gap . Existing models [ 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 ] lack the explicitness and 59 experimental scrutiny to deﬁne the checkpoint from the integrated biochemical and biomechanical properties 60 of CME . 61 EAPs initiate curvature generation at CCPs 62 Abortive pits fail to generate curvature [ 13 , 28 ] . Additionally , so - called pioneer EAPs that have curvature 63 generating activities [ 7 ] have been identiﬁed at nascent CCPs [ 1 , 38 ] . Therefore , to test the role of EAPs 64 in generating early curvature and establishing initial conditions for coat assembly , we measured the time - 65 dependent invagination depth at individual CCPs as an estimation of curvature generation during CME . For 66 this purpose , ARPE cells overexpressing eGFP - labelled clathrin light chain were imaged by near simultaneous 67 epiﬂuorescence ( Epi ) - TIRF ( total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ) microscopy [ 39 ] ( Fig . 1B ) . Images acquired 68 from the TIRF channel had higher signal - to - noise ( SNR ) ratio and were used for tracking clathrin intensities 69 over time [ 13 ] , whereas the Epi - channel more accurately reﬂects the rate of accumulation of clathrin at each 70 CCP . Bona ﬁde CCPs were identiﬁed from all the observed tracks using an unbiased ﬁlter of the intensity 71 ﬂuctuations that represent proper clathrin coat assembly [ 28 ] . Matching eGFP intensities were extracted 72 from low SNR Epi images using primary / subordinate channel tracking [ 13 ] . The resulting CCP intensity 73 traces from the two channels within a lifetime cohort of 24 − 40 seconds were aligned and averaged [ 40 ] , and 74 logarithmically transformed to give average traces of the invagination depth ( ∆ z ) of the CCPs’ center - of - mass 75 [ 39 ] ( Fig . 1C - D ) . We chose the 24 − 40 s cohort to reﬂect the invagination behavior of the most frequent tracks 76 among ∼ 5 × 10 4 CCPs over > 10 cells per each condition . See Methods for more details . 77 Clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein ( CALM ) , a phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin 78 assembly protein , and epsin are pioneer proteins [ 1 ] that function at early stages of CME : both bind clathrin 79 and are capable of bending membranes [ 41 , 21 ] . We therefore examined the eﬀect of siRNA - mediated knock - 80 down ( KD ) of CALM and epsin1 ( Fig . S1A - B ) on ∆ z . In negative control siRNA - treated cells ∆ z ascended 81 over time and reached ∼ 50 nm , as expected for an average ∼ 100 nm diameter CCV . In contrast , in CALM 82 KD cells ∆ z remained ﬂat at ∼ 0 nm ( Fig . 1C ) . This KD eﬀect is fully rescued by over - expressing CALM 83 ( Fig . S1C ) . KD of epsin1 also decreased initial curvature generation , albeit to a lesser extent ( Fig . 1D ) . These 84 defects in curvature formation indicate that CALM is required for and epsin1 contributes to the initiation of 85 curvature at CCPs . 86 A mechanochemical model for clathrin - coated pits 87 A computational model that incorporates the clathrin basket , the plasma membrane and EAPs’ curvature 88 generation was developed for studying CME as a molecularly and mechanically integrated system . We used 89 the preceding experimental ﬁndings in our model as a guide for setting the initial membrane morphology before 90 2 simulating subsequent coat assembly and further membrane bending . To compute the evolution of membrane 91 curvature during CME , we adopted a recent algorithm for simulating membrane morphological dynamics 92 under external force based on triangular meshes [ 42 ] ( Fig . 2A ) . The algorithm relies on a representation 93 of the membrane as a mesh of discrete triangular units . As the membrane deforms , eﬃcient remeshing is 94 implemented to dynamically adjust the mesh conﬁguration and to reﬂect membrane deformability without 95 reducing mesh quality . This ensures accurate computing of the membrane’s bending energy throughout CCV 96 formation [ 42 ] . Individual CME events are modeled as taking place on a complete sphere reﬂecting the closed 97 topology of real cells ( Fig . 2A ) . This avoids the complication of using truncated boundary conditions [ 43 ] 98 and enables more accurate computation of bending forces [ 42 ] . CME events are initiated at the bottom of the 99 sphere . To reduce computational load , the dimension of the model cell relative to a CCP was considerably 100 smaller than for a real cell , but still large enough to enclose an entire CME event and to exclude non - CME 101 related curvature eﬀects . To set initial conditions for control cells , we introduced some initial curvature at 102 the location of a future CME event prior to clathrin assembly . For the CALM KD cells , we introduced a ﬂat 103 region as the initial condition . For epsin1 KD cells , we introduced a degree of curvature between control and 104 CALM as the initial condition ( Fig . 2B ) . See Methods and ( Fig . S2A ) for more details and the units used 105 in the model . 106 Flexibility of clathrin assembly . The experimentally observed requirements for CALM and epsin1 in 107 initial curvature generation are consistent with previous ﬁndings in cells that clathrin - assembly alone was not 108 suﬃcient to generate curvature [ 13 ] , which in turn is consistent with the known ﬂexibility of clathrin baskets 109 [ 33 , 44 ] . To reﬂect such ﬂexibility and to compute the interactions between individual clathrin molecules , we 110 adopted a coarse - grained approach that structurally describes the triskelion by chains of spheres [ 45 ] ( Fig . 111 2C ) . One triskelion consists of a center sphere and three symmetrically attached arms , each consisting of 112 one proximal , one distal and one terminal domain represented by 17 spheres in total . Multiple triskelia can 113 self - assemble into polygonal baskets via interactions between their proximal domains that form lattice edges 114 [ 44 ] , a simpliﬁed but geometrically concrete representation of the high - resolution clathrin structure [ 46 ] . We 115 described such binding using four harmonic springs to reﬂect the previously mentioned ﬂexibility , a simpler 116 version of the previously proposed schemes of clathrin ﬂexibility [ 44 , 47 ] . Speciﬁcally , we deﬁned a spherical 117 coordinate system where the center of a triskelion T a ( blue in Fig . 2C ) points in the + z direction , and the 118 three terminal domains of T a remain on the equatorial plane . T a binds to another triskelion T b via interactions 119 between their proximal domains . The ﬁrst two springs , characterized by coeﬃcient k 1 , connect the central 120 sphere ( marked with a star ) of T a to the ‘corner’ sphere ( marked with a pentagon ) of T b . Conversely , they 121 connect the center of T b to the corner of T a ( Fig . 2D . 1 ) . The two k 1 springs controlled the rotational motion 122 of T b relative to T a about the mid - point between the two triskelia deﬁning a ‘ﬂapping’ ﬂexibility . 123 The second two springs , characterized by coeﬃcient k 2 , connect two imaginary control points outside T a 124 to another two control points outside T b , acting as two weightless balancing poles ( Fig . 2D . 2 ) . The relative 125 positions from the control points to T a and T b were ﬁxed so that the resulting spring forces and torques were 126 entirely applied to the two triskelia . The two k 2 springs mainly controlled the rotational motion of T b about the 127 axis ( p ) deﬁned by a proximal domain of T a , reﬂecting a ‘twisting’ ﬂexibility [ 47 ] . All the springs in this work 128 yield zero resting length , i . e . l 0 = 0 , and the total spring energy is equivalent to the chemical energy preserved 129 in a clathrin basket . Note that both k 1 and k 2 springs penalize a third ‘sliding’ ﬂexibility ( Fig . S2B ) that 130 could lead to unrealistic polygonal structures with (cid:29) 6 edges . Flat clathrin assemblies consist predominantly 131 of hexagonal structures [ 20 ] : ‘sliding’ is thus implausible . On the other hand , ‘ﬂapping’ ﬂexibility is plausible , 132 and can be manipulated by lowering k 1 to ﬂatten the hexagonal lattices . Increasing ‘ﬂapping’ is independent 133 on k 2 springs ( Fig . S2C ) ; therefore , k 2 is ﬁxed at a high value to prohibit ‘sliding’ without aﬀecting ‘ﬂapping’ . 134 Next , we integrated the chemical energy from clathrin basket assembly with the mechanical energy from 135 the bent membrane and computed the time evolution of the two components from initial conﬁguration to 136 steady state . The membrane and clathrin were mechanically connected via adaptor proteins , speciﬁcally AP2 137 [ 8 ] , which are represented as particles occupying multiple vertices on the membrane . We used another spring 138 with coeﬃcient k 3 to connect the AP2 - occupied vertices and the terminal domains of the clathrin triskelia 139 ( Fig . 2E ) . This third spring reﬂects the eﬀect of triskelia pulling or pushing the membrane . This tugging works 140 against triskelion - triskelion binding . Thus , the k 3 springs transfer energy from the clathrin coat assembly to 141 3 the membrane and vice versa they impose mechanical constraints by the membrane on the assembly process . 142 An AP2 particle moved from the membrane vertex it occupied only when moving to a neighboring vertex 143 would reduce the k 3 spring energy ( green dots and yellow springs in Fig . 2E ) . This relocation reﬂected the 144 sheer - stress - free property of the membrane . 145 Altogether , the described mechanochemical system represents individual clathrin triskelia as rigid bodies 146 free to undergo translational Brownian motion determined by the spring forces , and rotational Brownian 147 motion determined by the torques derived from those forces [ 48 ] . These include the k 1 , 2 spring forces and 148 torques from the clathrin - clathrin interaction , and the k 3 spring force and torque from the clathrin - membrane 149 interaction . On the other hand , individual vertices of the membrane , simply treated as particles , underwent 150 translational Brownian motion . This motion is determined by the k 3 spring force from the clathrin - membrane 151 interaction , and the internal force from the membrane itself caused by bending ( dominating term ) , lipid 152 reorganization , osmotic pressure and tension [ 42 ] . See Methods for more details . 153 Interplay between membrane curvature and basket structure 154 The membrane vertices dynamically depicted morphological changes upon interacting with a clathrin basket . 155 Given the initial membrane morphology for a particular molecular conﬁguration , we next let clathrin triskelia 156 assemble one by one . Clathrin baskets were able to attach closely to both curved and ﬂat membranes owing 157 to the ﬂexible interactions among triskelia and between triskelia and membrane . Most of the springs were 158 not resting at their natural length l 0 = 0 , thus reserving some energy to deform the membrane . We stopped 159 clathrin recruitment after 20 triskelia and relaxed the clathrin basket and the membrane together until equi - 160 librium was reached . Separation of clathrin recruitment and relaxation was necessary to reduce computational 161 time . Moreover , because considerable debate remains as to whether the clathrin basket assembles before or 162 along with curvature formation [ 14 ] , we chose to ﬁnish the assembly ﬁrst then simulate the dynamics of the 163 morphologies . See Methods for more details . 164 Modeling coat assembly at the three initial membrane morphologies reﬂecting control , CALM and epsin1 165 KD resulted in distinct pentagon - hexagon structures ( Fig . 3A ) , which relaxed into diﬀerent ﬁnal morphologies 166 ( Fig . 3B ) . Emerging from this mechanochemical conﬁguration , the 20 triskelia assembled into four pentagons 167 in the control cells , but only one in the CALM KD cells , and three in the epsin1 KD cells ( Fig . 3A , asterisks ) . 168 As a result , the basket in the control cells eventually created suﬃcient curvature to successfully enclose a 169 membrane vesicle ( Fig . 3B ) , but the basket in the CALM KD cells stayed relatively open and ﬂat , and the 170 basket under epsin1 KD reached lower curvature compared to control . Importantly , these diﬀerences match 171 our experimentally observed curvature defects of KD of curvature - generating pioneer EAPs , as well as the 172 relative eﬀects of CALM and epsin1 KD on CME and CCP dynamics [ 9 , 28 ] . They also reveal positive feedback 173 between initial membrane curvature and the incorporation of pentagons required for curvature - generation by 174 nascent clathrin baskets . 175 CCPs evolve into two states— Open and Closed 176 We next exploited the model to investigate possible diﬀerences between abortive and productive fates of CCPs . 177 For this purpose , we explored whether multiple equilibrium shapes of clathrin baskets exist and whether these 178 shapes depend on the basket strength , which might vary under diﬀerent molecular conditions ( i . e . as the 179 unimolecular clathrin ‘basket’ becomes a multi - component clathrin coat ) . The basket strength was varied 180 computationally by tuning the spring coeﬃcients . As discussed above , the k 2 springs must be strong ( k 2 (cid:29) 0 ) 181 to avoid unreasonable clathrin structures ; and the k 1 springs could be lowered for generating ﬂat lattices ( see 182 Methods and Fig . S2B - C ) . Therefore , we ﬁxed k 2 = 200 and treated k 1 as a free parameter to adjust basket 183 strengths . Additionally , we deﬁned a dimensionless tightness factor 184 T : = (cid:34)(cid:112)(cid:80) bound ( r center − r corner ) 2 n bound l p (cid:35) − 1 ( 1 ) 4 as the property to diﬀerentiate various equilibrium shapes of clathrin baskets . T monotonically reﬂects the 185 tightness of the basket : the larger T is , the closer ( i . e . tighter ) clathrin triskelia bind to each other . T 186 incorporates the summation of all the bound center - to - corner pairs , and is normalized by the number of pairs 187 n bound and the constant length of the proximal domain l p . We also set k 3 = 100 at a high value to let clathrin 188 baskets eﬀectively reshape the membrane . 189 Starting with an initial control membrane morphology , conﬁgurations with low k 1 = 10 evolve to an 190 Open basket equilibrium ( Fig . 4A , Video 1 ) . In contrast , at high k 1 = 100 , we observed Closed baskets at 191 equilibrium ( Fig . 4B , Video 2 ) . To examine the molecular conﬁguration of these states , we implemented a 192 high - resolution , realistic visualization of the clathrin triskelia and lipid - based membrane following the physical 193 scales indicated by the Protein Data Bank ( rcsb . org ) using a customized algorithm , see Methods for more 194 details . Importantly , the outcome of these simulations in terms of basket shapes do not linearly depend on 195 k 1 ; that is , the baskets do not continuously loosen while decreasing k 1 . Instead , the curve T vs k 1 displayed 196 a sigmoidal behavior with a sudden transition from open to closed shapes as k 1 crossed a critical value , k c 197 ( Fig . 4C ) . Interestingly , at k 1 = k c , both Open and Closed states could be observed , indicating the existence 198 of a switch - like behavior known to regulate biological systems at many scales , from neuronal synchronization 199 to bird ﬂocking [ 49 ] . Speciﬁcally , for a critical value k c = 30 , CCPs coexist in an Open state ( T < 20 ) or 200 Closed state ( T > 30 ) . However , moving k 1 beyond k c does not signiﬁcantly change T , suggesting that a 201 single closed state for these baskets exists . The two states obtained through time evolution are consistent with 202 a reductionist model describing equilibrium membrane morphologies under molecularly induced mechanical 203 manipulations [ 37 ] . Additionally , repeating simulations at k 1 = k c , yielded a bimodal distribution for T ( Fig . 204 4D ) , in agreement with recent super - resolution microscopy images of static CCPs [ 50 ] . 205 The two states emerging at k c are due to the membrane’s sensitive response to basket closure—the bending 206 energy ( E mem ) at the membrane vertices near the clathrin baskets are nonlinearly related to the basket 207 tightness ( T ) . To reveal this relation , > 300 values of E mem with T were chosen to fully represent the time 208 evolution of a given CCP from its initial to equilibrium state . We examined multiple k 1 = 20 , 30 , . . . 70 values 209 ( six evolutions per each k 1 ) to incorporate both Open and Closed scenarios . Each data point of ( E mem , T ) is 210 represented as a dot colored according to k 1 in Fig . 4E . After pooling all the data points , we show that when 211 E mem is small , increasing E mem corresponds to a nearly linear increase of T , indicating a more energetically 212 demanding stage of closure . However , when E mem (cid:38) 30 κ ( where the bending modulus of the membrane 213 κ = 100 k B T ) , small increases in E mem correspond to a dramatic increase of T , indicating a nearly eﬀortless 214 closure of baskets at k 1 ≥ k c . Baskets with k 1 < k c are gated by the energetic threshold . The sensitive relation 215 between the membrane and the baskets governs the bi - state transition around k c . 216 The endocytic checkpoint is a mechanochemical switch 217 Biologically , the Open / Closed switch delineates the state boundary between abortive and productive CCPs . 218 Based on our model , we speculate that cells operate with clathrin coats assembled near the critical value 219 k 1 ∼ k c . Small changes in k 1 can thus control the abortive vs productive fate of CCPs . We propose that the 220 exquisite sensitivity of the switch deﬁnes the mechanism of the endocytic checkpoint . Transitions from Open 221 to Closed can occur with the recruitment of clathrin or AP2 - binding EAPs that strengthen the clathrin basket 222 to alter k 1 [ 11 ] . Additionally , EAPs that strengthen interactions between clathrin baskets and the membrane , 223 e . g . by binding membranes , AP2 and / or clathrincan aﬀect k 3 springs and impact the relation k 1 vs T . Cutting 224 k 3 in half leads to lower curvatures because the increased compliance of the springs allows the membrane to 225 depart from the basket geometry and relax in a ﬂatter conﬁguration with smaller bending force . As a result , 226 open baskets at k 1 = 30 and even some at k 1 = 20 become closed ( Fig . S3A - B ) . Conversely , doubling k 3 raises 227 geometric constraints imposed by the basket onto the membrane , thus causing larger curvatures and larger 228 bending forces that prevent open k 1 = 30 baskets to close ( Fig . S3C - D ) . Lastly , EAPs that induce membrane 229 curvature could alter k c by sharing some energetic burden with clathrin and allowing baskets with k 1 < k c 230 to close . This could explain the observed relationship between membrane curvature and clathrin assembly 231 [ 10 , 11 , 12 ] . 232 Following these ﬁndings , we therefore computationally evaluated whether the fate - determining switch 233 5 that emerges from the competition between basket closure and membrane resistance against bending could 234 be inﬂuenced by EAPs that induce curvature to assist clathrin . For this , we introduced k 4 springs ( Fig . 5A ) 235 to parameterize additional curvature generation at the clathrin lattice . Curvature generation by EAPs would 236 force compaction of the internal membrane meshwork . Thus , these k 4 springs pull neighboring AP2 - occupied 237 membrane vertices towards a controlling center that extends extracellularly by a certain distance r w . Indeed , 238 these added forces help the clathrin baskets to bend the membrane . Under weak k 4 springs ( k 4 = 10 ) , T values 239 at k 1 ≤ k c were already signiﬁcantly increased . Consequently , some originally Open baskets with k 1 < k c 240 ( k 1 = 20 , i . e . modeling increased EAP - imposed curvature ) and all of the open baskets with k 1 = k c = 30 241 became closed ( Fig . 5B . 1 , S4 ) . The baskets with k 1 (cid:28) k c ( k 1 = 10 ) stayed open . Under stronger k 4 springs 242 ( k 4 = 20 ) , all of the k 1 < k c ( k 1 = 20 ) baskets and even a k 1 (cid:28) k c ( k 1 = 10 ) basket closed ( Fig . 5B . 2 , 243 S4 ) . Importantly , the observed switch - like behavior , and the co - existence of two states , persist independent 244 of k 4 . Thus , curvature generating EAPs could inﬂuence the switch - like endocytic checkpoint by increasing T 245 at k 1 < k c , or , eﬀectively , by lowering k c , to promote basket closure and thus productive CCPs . 246 A role for dynamin2 in the endocytic checkpoint . Dynamin is an EAP best known for its roles during 247 membrane ﬁssion [ 51 ] ; however numerous studies have implicated an earlier function for dynamin2 ( Dyn2 ) in 248 regulating the endocytic checkpoint [ 4 , 13 , 2 ] . In experiments with endogenously labelled Dyn2 , both Dyn2 - 249 positive and - negative CCPs were observed [ 13 ] and statistical analyses of thousands of pits revealed that 250 Dyn2 - negative CCPs are predominantly abortive . In line with this data , siRNA - mediated knockdown of Dyn2 251 resulted in a decrease in stabilized CCPs and an increase in short - lived abortive CCPs [ 52 ] . In further support 252 of its early role in CME , Dyn2 is present on nascent and ﬂat CCPs [ 53 , 32 ] and high - resolution correlative 253 light and electron microscopy has positioned Dyn2 towards the edges of ﬂat and domed clathrin lattices , along 254 with FCHO and Eps15 [ 32 ] . Finally , results from a comprehensive CRISPRi - mediated knockdown screen of 255 67 EAPs , revealed common phenotypes between Dyn2 and several pioneer EAPs ( e . g . CALM . Eps15 , epsin1 , 256 FCHO1 , NECAP2 ) , namely a lower initiation rate and smaller fraction of stable CCPs [ 9 ] . 257 Based on their spatial and phenotypic similarities , we tested the eﬀects of siRNA - mediated KD of Dyn2 , 258 Eps15 and FCHO2 ( Fig . S5A - C ) on CCP invagination depth ( ∆ z ) using our Epi - TIRF assay . Unexpectedly , 259 KD of the known curvature - generating protein FCHO2 did not signiﬁcantly inhibit CCP invagination , nor 260 did KD of Eps15 ( Fig . 5C ) . In contrast , siRNA - mediated KD of Dyn2 resulted in a strong reduction in CCP 261 invagination depth ( ∆ z ∼ 0 ) similar to CALM KD ( Fig . 5D ) . This eﬀect was fully rescued by re - introduction 262 of Dyn2 ( Fig . S5D ) . The observed Dyn2 - requirement for curvature generation earlier than its membrane - 263 ﬁssion function [ 54 ] could result either from known direct ( through its wedging function [ 55 ] ) or indirect 264 ( through its interactions with curvature generating EAPs [ 7 ] ) activities of Dyn2 . These results establish that 265 Dyn2 plays a key role in regulating the endocytic checkpoint by relieving the constraint on basket strength 266 to allow baskets with k 1 ≤ k c to close ( Fig . 5B ) . 267 Conclusion 268 Our combined experimental and computational ﬁndings deﬁne the long - proposed concept of an endocytic 269 checkpoint as an emergent property of the mechanochemical interaction between membrane and clathrin 270 machinery . Using a realistic model of these interactions adjusted to experiments , we identify two states of 271 CCPs according to the shape of clathrin baskets : an Open state for weak baskets and a Closed state for 272 strengthened baskets . These two states match our previous perception of the abortive and productive fates 273 developed based on the statistics of CCP lifetime . We speculate that plasma membranes and the clathrin 274 baskets that assemble upon them are poised at k 1 ∼ k c , hence allowing for the regulation of CME by EAPs 275 that aﬀect membrane curvature and / or the strength of the assembled basket . 276 The presented data and accompanying model jointly resolve three long - standing puzzles in the ﬁeld of 277 CME : i ) We ﬁnd that nascent CCP progression is gated by an emergent mechanochemical property of the en - 278 ergy balance between clathrin basket assembly and membrane bending . Thus the elucive endocytic checkpoint 279 is not a molecular machine , but a biophysical characteristic of CCP maturation ; ii ) The sensitive switch - like 280 behavior of the endocytic checkpoint oﬀers an explanation for how functionally diverse EAPs can determine 281 6 the fate of abortive or productive CCPs ; iii ) We discover Dyn2 as a key regulator of early curvature gen - 282 eration and provide a mechanism for its observed ability to regulate the endocytic checkpoint . Together 283 these discoveries explain the resilience and observed compensatory behavior of CME [ 13 , 28 , 14 ] in that the 284 mechanochemical switch - like behavior of the checkpoint is exquisitely sensitive to the interplay between mem - 285 brane curvature and the strength of the clathrin basket , either of which can be modulated by functionally 286 diverse EAPs . 287 7 Methods 288 Cell lines 289 ARPE19 - HPV16 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Gibco DMEM / F12 medium ( ThermoFisher , 290 11330032 ) . A version of the cell line stably expressing eGFP - CLCa was generated as described in our previous 291 work [ 56 ] . 292 siRNA transfection and rescue 293 Cells for siRNA interference were seeded on a six - well plate ( 250 , 000 cells / well ) and transfected with siRNA 294 after 6 hours . Two rounds of transfection were conducted over 3 days to achieve > 90 % target protein 295 knockdown on day 4 of the experiments . For each transfection , 100 µl Opti - MEM with 110 pmol siRNA 296 ( tube 1 ) and 100 µl Opti - MEM ( Gibco ) with 6 . 5 µl Lipofectamine RNAi - MAX ( Invitrogen ) ( tube 2 ) were 297 incubated at room temperature for 5 min . Then , the reagents in tube 1 and 2 were mixed and incubated 298 at room temperature for 15 min before adding them drop by drop to the cells . siControl : 5’ - UUC UCC 299 GAA CGU GUC ACG U - 3’ ; siCALM : 5’ - ACAGUUGGCAGACAGUUUA - 3’ ; siDyn2 ( 3’UTR ) : a mixture of 300 # 1 5’ - CUGCACUCUGUAUUCUAUUAAUAAA - 3’ , and # 2 5’ - GGUAUAUCAACUUCCCAUUAGCAGG - 3’ ; 301 siEPS15 : 5’ - AAACGGAGCUACAGAUUAUUU - 3’ ; siFCHO2 : 5’ - CCAAGUGUGUAGAACAGGAGCGUUU - 302 3’ ; si - epsin1 : mixture of # 1 5’ - GAUCAAGGUUCGAGAGGCC - 3’ , # 2 5’ - GGAAGACGCCGGAGUCAUU - 3’ , 303 # 3 5’ - GAACGUGCGUGAGAAAGCU - 3’ , and # 4 5’ - ACUAAUCCCUUCCUCCUAU - 3’ . CALM ( Protein - 304 Tech , 28554 - 1 - AP ) , Dyn2 ( SantaCruz , sc - 166669 ) , EPS15 ( abcam , ab174291 ) , epsin1 ( ZEN - BIO , R24229 ) , 305 FCHO2 ( Genetex , GTX120444 ) , and GADPH ( ABclonal , AC033 ) antibodies were used for Western Blotting 306 to conﬁrm siRNA knockdown eﬃciency . 307 For CALM rescue experiments , we expressed wildtype CALM ( with a myc - tag and siRNA - resistant coding 308 sequence ) using a retroviral vector ( giftfrom David Owen ) [ 41 ] . For Dyn2 rescue experiments , wildtype DNM2 309 with a N - terminal HA - tag was cloned into pLVx - IRES - puro vector with a distinct 3’ UTR . Corresponding 310 retro - and lenti - viruses were produced in 293T cells and used to infect ARPE19 - HPV16 eGFP - CLCa cells to 311 achieve stable expression of exogenous CALM and Dyn2 . 312 Epi - TIRF microscopy imaging and quantiﬁcation 313 Cells were grown on a gelatin - coated 35mm glass bottom ibidi dish ( ibidi , # 81218 ) overnight . Imaging 314 was conducted with a 100 × oil , NA 1 . 49 Apo TIRF objective ( Nikon ) mounted on an Eclipse Ti2 inverted 315 microscope equipped with 1 ) a H - TIRF module for TIRF acquisition ( penetration depth = 80 nm ) , 2 ) a M - 316 TIRF module for epiﬂuorescence acquisition , and 3 ) an Okolab cage incubator to sustain 5 % CO2 and 37 ◦ C . 317 For time - lapsed Epi / TIRF imaging , TIRF and epiﬂuorescence signals were acquired nearly simultaneously at 318 the frame rate of 0 . 66 frame / s . The Nikon Perfect Focus System ( PFS ) was applied during imaging . 319 After imaging , cmeAnalysis [ 13 ] was applied for tracking ﬂuorescently labelled particles , including gap 320 closing [ 57 ] . Tracks that overlap with others or deviate from the properties of a diﬀraction - limited particle 321 were excluded from the analysis . Tracks passing this ﬁltering scheme were further classiﬁed into bona ﬁde 322 CCPs vs clathrin - coats by DASC [ 28 ] , a ﬂuctuation - based unbiased method . The tracks classiﬁed as CCPs 323 were used for ∆ z measurement . All image analysis software and parameter settings for Epi - TIRF analysis 324 are available at https : / / github . com / DanuserLab / cmeAnalysis . 325 Modeling 326 Membrane initiation 327 For simulations of membrane bending under the mechanical constraints imposed by the clathrin - coat we 328 leveraged the recently published triangular - mesh - based method [ 42 ] . This method optimally balances the 329 physical and geometrical conditions that govern the computing accuracy and eﬃciency . The dynamics of CCP 330 8 morphology is captured by an algorithm that controls the mesh - based representation of the membrane based 331 on physical potentials . Remeshing operations are initiated when either the triangular geometry or the local 332 strain in the mesh degenerate , thus maintaining high mesh quality for accurately computing membrane - related 333 interactions . To start a simulation a spherical membrane is slightly pulled by external control points that 334 initiate curvature . Dependent on the molecular conditions ( WT , CALM KD and epsin1 KD ) the points were 335 placed at diﬀerent heights to generate diﬀerent initial equilibrium geometries for further computation ( Fig . 336 1F , Fig . S3A ) ; see the method ‘ ClathrinMediatedEndocytosisInit ’ in the class ‘ @ BiophysicsApp’ on GitHub : 337 https : / / github . com / DanuserLab / biophysicsModels for further documentation . Throughout the paper the 338 energy unit 1 k B T and length unit 10 nm are used for scaling . 339 Forces , torques , noises and dynamics 340 All spring forces were computed as F s 12 = − k ( r 2 − r 1 ) , indicating the force exerted in point 1 by an elastic 341 connector to point 2 . Other forces were numerically derived from the energy potential as F = − [ E ( r + ∆ r ) − 342 E ( r ) ] / ∆ r ( see Table S1 ) . These potentials include volume and surface area constraints on the membrane , 343 reﬂecting osmotic pressure and membrane tension ; the Helfrich bending energy [ 58 ] , reﬂecting the membrane 344 bending force ; and the internal energy of the membrane , reﬂecting the resistance to deformation . The latter 345 also controls the mesh geometry , as described above . Implementing these forces requires an adaptive time 346 step for enhancing computational eﬃciency . Detailed implementations and instructions of these forces , the 347 remeshing and adaptive time step can be found in [ 42 ] and our GitHub repository . We treated clathrin 348 triskelia as rigid bodies following [ 48 ] . Each triskelion consists of 52 spheres according to [ 45 ] . A Cartesian 349 rotation vector a deﬁned as the rotation coordinates [ 59 ] was implemented to describe rotational movement 350 of the triskelia . As a result , the torque within the triskelia is derived from the rotational variation to the total 351 spring energy E tots = (cid:80) E s , summing over all the pairs of connected points ( see Table S1 ) : 352 τ = − E tots [ r ( a + ∆ a ) ] − E tots [ r ( a ) ] ∆ a Here r indicates the coordinates of the points in the triskelia and a indicates the triskelia’s orientations in 353 space [ 48 ] . 354 All forces on the membrane vertices were included in a Langevin equation with adaptive time steps that 355 eﬃciently describes overdamped Brownian motion , see [ 42 ] . The random force was eliminated to reduce 356 the noise that aﬀects the morphologies . All forces and torques on the clathrin triskelia were included in 357 a rotational Langevin equation [ 48 ] with the random force eliminated . Also , the k 3 spring force , and the 358 forces derived from osmotic pressure and tension in a particular vertex were spatially smoothed by averaging 359 over the immediately neighboring vertices . Removing the random forces and the spatial averaging reduced 360 the impact of noise and numerical distortions associated with the discrete meshing , resulting in sharper 361 transitions between the Open and Closed states . However , the remeshing process still implies on some random 362 decisions during triangulation [ 42 ] . Therefore , for any given parameter setting multiple simulations were run 363 to obtain statistically meaningful results . The dynamics of CCP formation is implemented in the application 364 ‘ ClathrinMediatedEndocytosis ’ . 365 For simulating a molecular wedge , k 4 springs generate forces in the vertices neighboring an AP2 - occupied 366 vertex , pointing towards the control points above the vertex ( Fig . 5A ) . These forces are balanced in the 367 control point by a force exerted on the AP2 - occupied vertex . For asymmetric mesh conﬁgurations , these two 368 sets of forces generate also a torque about the connector between vertex and control point . However , for 369 computational simpliﬁcation we neglect this torque because of the usually nearly equidistant arrangement of 370 the vertices pulled by k 4 springs about the AP2 vertex . 371 Clathrin assembly 372 After initializing the membrane morphology , clathrin triskelia were placed on the membrane one by one . After 373 a triskelion attaches to the membrane it was subjected to mechanical relaxation before the next , adjacent 374 9 triskelion was placed . The newly added triskelion was relaxed with at least one proximal leg bound to the 375 previous ones . During relaxation , the membrane was ﬁxed . However , the feet of the triskelia were allowed to 376 move to connect to membrane vertices under minimization of of the k 3 spring energy . We limited the basket 377 sizes to 20 triskelia for computational eﬃciency . Moreover , because of the size - invariance of the mebrane 378 bending energy [ 58 ] , the default basket of 20 triskelia bears a higher energy density than baskets with a 379 larger size . Therefore , smaller baskets are more relevant to explore the functions of EAPs in modulating the 380 checkpoint . 381 High - resolution visualization of simulation data in 3D 382 The 3D visualizations of clathrin - membrane interactions were generated using OmVisim , a 3D visualization 383 software created by Omphalos Lifescience Inc . Each spatial - related property from the original Matlab sim - 384 ulation data was linearly transformed to correspond to the coordinate space of OmVisim , without altering 385 the original shape and relative positioning of the objects . For clathrin visualization , a set of positions and 386 orientations of clathrin was used to spawn a single triskelion mesh ( PDB ID : 3IYV on Protein Data Bank ; 387 processed using PyMOL —https : / / pymol . org / 2 / ) . For membrane visualization , the triangle vertices of the 388 membrane and interpolated positions between the vertices were used to approximate a membrane surface . 389 Assuming a lipid bilayer depth of 7 nm , another membrane surface was generated solely for visualization pur - 390 poses . Then , lipid meshes ( PDB ID : 8ND ; processed using PyMOL and Blender—https : / / www . blender . org / ) 391 were spawned to populate the surfaces , resulting in a lipid bilayer visualization . To view cross - sections of 392 the visualizations , a “null space” was introduced into the 3D environment where nothing is rendered . Visual 393 parameters that are not derived from any simulation data , including lipid size and other stylistic properties 394 like color , lighting , and camera positioning , were ﬁne - tuned to enhance visual clarity . 395 Acknowledgment 396 We thank Jenny ( Qiongjing ) Zou for software management , Madhura Bhave for data sharing and Milo Lin 397 for helpful discussion .
