Carcamo 1 , 2 , 3 , Sushil Pangeni 1 , 4 , Taekjip Ha 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 * Cells connect with their environment through surface receptors and use physical tension in receptor – ligand bonds for various cellular processes . Single - molecule techniques have revealed bond strength by measuring “ rupture force , ” but it has long been recognized that rupture force is dependent on loading rate — how quickly force is ramped up . Thus , the physiological loading rate needs to be measured to reveal the mechanical strength of individual bonds in their functional context . We have developed an overstretching tension sensor ( OTS ) to allow more accurate force measurement in physiological conditions with single - molecule detection sensitivity even in mechanically active regions . We used serially connected OTSs to show that the integrin loading rate ranged from 0 . 5 to 4 piconewtons per second and was about three times higher in leukocytes than in epithelial cells . P hysical forces govern many cellular pro - cesses , including cell adhesion , migra - tion , division , and differentiation ( 1 – 3 ) . Single - molecule mechanical measure - menttechnologiescanrevealthestrength of these bonds in the form of “ rupture force ” ( 4 ) . The rupture force depends on the loading rate , which is a measure of how quickly the force is ramped up during such measurements ( 4 – 6 ) . Loading rates in single - molecule mea - surements range from as low as ~ 0 . 1 pN / s in optical or magnetic tweezers up to ~ 10 6 pN / s in atomic force microscopy , resulting in a sub - stantial range of measured rupture forces even for the same bond , depending on the applied loading rate ( 7 – 9 ) . Thus , the physiological load - ing rate must be determined to reveal the rele - vant mechanical strength of individual bonds in their functional context ( 10 ) . However , the measurement of cellular force loading rate at the single - molecule level has remained a con - siderable challenge . To explore receptor - specific mechanotrans - duction by measuring the force exerted on individual receptors in living cells , molecu - lar tension probes have been developed that transduce the detected force into fluorescence signals ( 11 ) . Force - sensitive nanostructures , such as elastic peptides and DNA hairpins , have been used to measure piconewton forces ( 3 to 20 pN ) ( 12 , 13 ) . Meanwhile , force - rupturable structures , such as a DNA – protein complex and double - stranded DNA ( dsDNA ) , have been adopted to limit the maximum tension exerted on a single receptor ( 4 to 56 pN ) ( 14 , 15 ) . Such tension regulation studies have shown that a certain level of force on integrin is required for cell spreading , with the threshold differ - ing substantially between integrin subtypes ( 10 to 40 pN ) ( 14 , 16 ) . Thus , understanding diverse mechanotransduction processes de - mands accurate measurement and monitor - ing of force in the tens of piconewtons range . In this study , we used DNA overstretching – induced dehybridization of an oligonucleotide to measure a broad range of single - molecular tension ( 16 to 95 pN ) with minimal interfer - ence on the target receptors . Stretching force – induced oligonucleotide dehybridization When stretched with a high force ( > 60 pN ) , long dsDNA undergoes a structural transition from its native B - form to a partially single - stranded state ( 17 ) , and short DNA can be fully dehybridized even at lower forces ( 18 – 20 ) . We hypothesized that the dehybridization of oligonucleotides occurs at different levels of force depending on their sequence , both composition and length , allowing each se - quence to serve as a digital tension sensor . To test this , we sourced 18 – base pair ( bp ) sequences with different GC content ( 39 , 50 , 61 , and 83 % ) from the bacteriophage lambda DNA ( l DNA ) and fluorescently labeled the DNA oligonucleotides ( table S1 ) . A double - stranded l DNAwas captured in a microfluidic chamber using an optical tweezers system ( fig . S1 ) . The l DNA was biotinylated on both ends of the same strand and attached to streptavidin - coated polystyrene beads . A single - stranded l DNA ( ss l DNA ) template was generated by overstretching the l DNA with force exceed - ing 75 pN . The fluorescently labeled oligonu - cleotides were subsequently hybridized to the ss l DNA at low tension ( ~ 5 pN ) . Their positions were monitored using confocal scanning imag - ing and identified by their binding positions in l DNA ( table S1 ) . We stretched the ss l DNA templateat aconstant speed of100 nm / s . As the force applied to the ss l DNA increased , the probes began to dissociate ( Fig . 1B ) . The de - hybridization forces at roomtemperature ( 25°C ) of the four probes were 32 , 35 , 44 , and 55 pN , correlating with rising GC content ( Fig . 1C ) . Shorter probes ( 15 bp , GC 40 % and 60 % ) dehybridized at a force 11 pN lower than the 18 - bp probes ( fig . S1 ) . A longer probe ( 25 bp , GC 84 % ) withstood force up to 60 pN , approach - ing the overstretching force of l DNA . To fur - ther expand the detection range , we evaluated a high – GC content ( 18 bp , GC 83 % ) peptide nucleic acid ( PNA ) sequence . The dehybrid - ization force rose from 55 pN for DNA homo - duplex to 95 pN for the PNA – DNA hybrid ( fig . S1 ) , reflecting the higher stability of PNA – DNA hybrids ( 21 ) . To assess how loading rate influences dehy - bridization force , we performed experiments at stretching speeds of 20 , 50 , 100 , and 300 nm / s , yielding loading rates ranging from 0 . 2 to 5 . 9 pN / s for probes tested ( Fig . 1D ) . As loading rate increased , dehybridization force generally increased , but the change remained modest across the tested range . Specifically , a probe ( 18 bp , GC 61 % ) exhibited dehybridization forces of 43 . 1 ± 3 . 3 pN ( SD ; 0 . 23 pN / s ) , 43 . 0 ± 2 . 9 pN ( 0 . 58 pN / s ) , 43 . 8 ± 3 . 9 pN ( 1 . 2 pN / s ) , and 45 . 5 ± 4 . 0 pN ( 3 . 7 pN / s ) at the varying speeds . This modest increase suggests that de - hybridization of these oligonucleotides accu - rately reports force near this range of loading rates . Moreover , by varying oligo sequence , length , and chemical composition , the detec - tion force can be programmed . Finally , we measured dehybridization forces at 37°C , the temperature used for our live - cell experiments . The force levels were lowered by between 8 and 16 pN for the 18 - bp probes and by 2 pN for the 25 - bp probe ( Fig . 1D ) . Overstretching tension sensor Using the characterized sequences , we devel - oped digital tension sensors ( 20 ) , which we call overstretching tension sensors ( OTSs ) . First , we targeted a V integrins ( 16 ) by conjugating cyclo - RGDfK peptide ( cRGDfK ) to the 5 ′ end of ssDNA and biotinylating its 3 ′ end ( Fig . 2A ) . To avoid steric hindrance , we incorporated a polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) linker into the pep - tide and appended six thymines at the 3 ′ end ofDNA . A Cy3 fluorophorewasattachedto the sixth thymine from the 3 ′ end ( fig . S2 ) . A com - plementaryoligonucleotide , conjugated with a fluorescent quencher ( BHQ2 ) at the 5 ′ end , was hybridizedtoformaDNAduplex . Consequently , the fluorescence signal is suppressed until the quencher strand is removed by stretching force . Hamsterepithelialcells ( CHO - K1 ) wereseeded onto a PEG - coated glasssurface functionalized with OTSs . OTSs , incorporating the DNA se - quence with dehybridization forces of 30 , 46 , or 58 pN ( 37°C , 100 nm / s ) , were denoted as dp30 , dp46 , and dp58 , respectively .

Thus , the results should be interpreted cau - tiously when these parameters deviate from the calibrated conditions . The cells spread well on all three surfaces , producing force - generated fluorescence sig - nals in a streak pattern of mature focal adhe - sions ( Fig . 2B ) . For comparison , cells were also seeded on surfaces coated with tension gauge tethers ( TGTs ) , DNA - based tension regulators that restrict the maximum integrin force to 33 , 43 , or 53 pN , as predicted by physical model - ing ( 14 , 21 ) . The cell area increased with higher allowedintegrin forcesontheTGTsurfaces . In contrast , the cell area remained constant on the three OTS surfaces and was larger than on the TGT surfaces ( Fig . 2C and fig . S3 ) . Thus , OTS offers uniform and strong mechanical support regardless of its dehybridization force , unlike the rupturable TGTs that change cell adhesion responses depending on the tension thresholds . The dehybridization signal was less frequent for dp43 than for dp30 and was very low for dp58 , indicatingthatsingle - integrinforcesrarely exceed58pN ( Fig . 2D ) . Similarpatternsofspread - ing and force transmission were also observed in human foreskin fibroblasts , BJ - 5ta ( fig . S3 ) . OTS cumulatively records force transmis - sion events , and the analysis of signal increase through time - lapse imaging allows for tempo - ral resolution of force - generated signals ( 22 ) . Human foreskin fibroblast spreading on the dp30 surface exhibited streaky force signal patterns , resulting from the accumulation of puncta at the growing tip of focal adhesions ( Fig . 2E ) ( 16 , 21 ) . Despite the high density of dp43 used to facilitate fibroblast spreading ( ~ 1500 m m − 2 ) ( 16 ) , force signal calibration showed that OTS still achieved near – single - molecule level detection sensitivity owing to its high quenching and annealing efficiency ( Fig . 2E and movie S1 ) . Focal adhesions are multiprotein structures that establish physical connections between internal actin bundles and the external sub - strate . The dp30 force signals showed a clear alignment with paxillin , which served as a fo - cal adhesion marker ( fig . S4 ) . To further inves - tigate dynamic force transmission during focal adhesion formation and maturation , we an - alyzed the force signal time trajectories . The temporally aligned signal traces clearly showed that force transmission predominantly occurs during an increase in paxillin signal ( Fig . 2F ) . During this phase , the reflection interference contrast microscopy ( RICM ) signal progres - sively decreased owing to close contact be - tween the cell membrane and the substrate , signifying the strengthening of cell adhesion to the substrate . After the peak of the paxillin signal , the force signal rapidly faded , suggest - ing that forces higher than 30 pN play an im - portant role in focal adhesion maturation . In summary , simultaneous imaging of OTS , paxillin , and RICM shows that the OTS re - ports on single - molecule force events during mechanical signaling . OTS refreshing Near focal adhesions , OTS force signals grad - uallyaccumulatedovertimeowingtofrequentforcetransmission , diminishing the sensitivity for detecting additional force transmission events . After 90 min of fibroblast spreading , we observed intense fluorescence signals con - centrated in focal adhesions , corresponding to > 100 force - activated dp46 molecules per square micrometer ( Fig . 3A ) . Although 90 % of the OTS remained intact , allowing for additional force detection without substantial underestimation , the existing fluorescence sig - nals reduced the detection sensitivity . To re - store high detection sensitivity in these regions , we introduced quencher strands into the im - aging chamber . These strands hybridized to the ruptured OTSstrandswithin2min , effectivelyerasingthe force - generated fluorescence signals ( Fig . 3B ) , andthesubsequentremovalofquencherstrandsallowedforcerecordingstoresume . This ap - proach of OTS refreshing maintained high de - tection sensitivity even after prolonged cell incubation , without disrupting cells ( Fig . 3C ) . To monitor force transmission within ma - tured focal adhesions , we imaged dp30 in fibroblasts at 10 - s intervals . We observed submicrometer - sized spots that slowly trans - located along the focal adhesion ( Fig . 3D ) . Fig . 1 . Stretching force – induced oligonucleotide dehybridization .

Dehybridization force of five DNA oligonucleotides was measured using four different stretching speeds ( 20 , 50 , 100 , and 300 nm / s ) . The loading rates corresponding to the applied force were calculated using force - extension data and stretching speed ( fig . S1 ) . Data are mean ± SD .

These transient small clusters were also detected with dp46 , but less frequently ( fig . S5 ) . Overall , OTS refreshing revealed integrin subclusters within integrin - dense focal adhesions , which may collectively share the mechanical load and mediate dy - namic and localized force transmission . Integrin force loading rate measurements The mechanical stability of biochemical bonds between molecular components — including ligands , surface receptors , adapter proteins , andactinfilaments — isdependent on theforce loading rate . Single - molecule force measure - ments have revealed the rupture force of bonds or unfolding force of proteins ( 7 – 9 ) . However , the specific loading rate that is most pertinent in vivo for each scenario remains to be clarified . Furthermore , considerationoftheloadingrate is fundamental to the force measurement it - self because the structural change of a tension probe depends not only on the force level but also on the loading rate ( 23 ) . At least two levels of force should be detected within a single tension sensor to measure load - ing rate . To achieve this , we labeled dp16 with Atto647N and dp30 with Cy3 and then serially connected them ( Fig . 4A ) . In dp16 / dp30 , the Atto647N signal ( red ) appeared when the ap - plied tension was > 16 pN , and the Cy3 signal ( green ) appeared when the force exceeded 30 pN . To monitor single - molecule force sig - nals without overlap , we immobilized a low density ( 0 . 7 m m − 2 ) of dp16 / dp30 ( fig . S6 ) . The density of fluorescent spots was even lower because most OTSs were in the quenched state . To facilitate cell spreading , integrin li - gands were additionally immobilized through a ssDNA linker of equal length . A density of 110 m m − 2 of cRGDfK ligands was sufficient to support epithelial cell ( U2 - OS ) spreading ( Fig . 4B ) . After cell spreading and subsequent OTS re - freshing , we observed the emergence of dp16 signal ( red ) , followed by dp30 signal ( green ) on the same diffraction - limited spot , indicat - ing a 13 . 2 pN increase in force across a single integrin – ligand bond ( Fig . 4C , movie S2 , and fig . S1 ) . Such colocalized spots were observed only in the cell - occupied area ( movies S2 and S3 ) . The histogram of the delay time between dp16 and dp30 signals exhibited a single - exponential decay , with a decay time of 13 . 4 s ( fig . S9 ) , corresponding to an average loading rate of 0 . 99 pN / s ( D F / D t = 13 . 2 pN / 13 . 4 s ) . This observed loading rate aligned closely with the loading rate used in the force calibrations ( 0 . 4 to 0 . 9 pN / s for 16 to 30 pN at 37°C ) , demon - strating consistency between the cellular force and OTS calibration loading rates ( fig . S1 ) . The probability that two different integrins se - quentially bind and activate the same OTS is expected to be very low because only 0 . 6 % of sensors are fluorescently labeled and < 0 . 1 % of the labeled sensors are activated per time point under our measurement condition ( 0 . 2 - s exposure every 5 s ) . Actomyosin activity and actin polymeriza - tion drive cellular forces . We explored their roles in force transmission and loading rates using cytoskeletalinhibitors onepithelialcells . Para - amino - blebbistatin ( 10 m M ) , inhibiting actomyosin activity , did not alter cell spread - ing on OTS ( dp16 , dp30 , and dp46 ) but reduced force transmission events by 30 % ( fig . S8 ) and decreasedtheloadingrateto 0 . 74pN / s ( Fig . 4C ) . CK666 suppresses actin branching by inacti - vating Arp2 / 3 ( 24 ) . Similar to BJ - 5ta fibroblast ( 16 ) , CK666 ( 50 m M ) did not affect epithelial cell spreading area or force transmission fre - quency ( fig . S8 ) . Notably , however , CK666 low - ered the loading rate to 0 . 56 pN / s ( Fig . 4C ) , highlighting actin branching ’ s key rolein force development .

S8 ) , precluding loading rate measurement . Leukocytes migrate from the bloodstream to inflammation sites through sequential adhesive interactions . The force loading rate on integrin a 4 b 1 in leukocytes was measured using dp16 / dp30 conjugated with an a 4 b 1 - specific ligand , LDVP peptide ( MUPA - LDVPAAK ) ( 16 ) . Monocytes ( THP - 1 ) adhered to the LDVP - coated surface ( 0 . 7 m m − 2 dp16 / dp30 , 11 m m − 2 in total ) , transmitting high forces ( movie S3 ) . The average loading rate between 16 pN and 30 pN was 2 . 7 pN / s ( Fig . 4E and fig . S7 ) , about three times higher than that of epithe - lial cells . Given that actin retrograde flow relies on the cell membrane ’ s reaction force , the phys - ical properties of the membrane likely play a crucial role in transmitting force to the sub - strate . In hypertonic medium , which reduces the osmotic pressure , a lower loading rate was observed ( 1 . 9 pN / s ) ( Fig . 4F ) . Conversely , hy - potonic conditions yielded a higher loading rate ( 4 . 0 pN / s ) . Thus , membrane tension may influence the loading rate , possibly by facilitat - ing actin retrograde flow . Cytochalasin D , at 10 m M , inhibited mono - cyte spreading and force transmission . How - ever , at 0 . 5 m M , cell area was not significantly reduced , and force transmission persisted ( fig . S9 ) , allowing loading rate measurement . The loading rate ( 1 . 8 pN / s ) was significantly lower than that of the control ( 2 . 8 pN / s ; Fig . 4G ) , underscoring actin polymerization ’ s im - portance in force development . Otheractinpolymerizationinhibitors , SMIFH2 ( 1 m M ) and CK666 ( 10 m M ) , also reduced the loading rate , but the effects were less pro - nounced . Notably , inhibition of actomyosin activity did not significantly decrease mono - cyte spreading area , force transmission fre - quency ( dp30 ) , or loading rate , implying that actin polymerization primarily drives mono - cyte adhesion ( Fig . 4G and fig . S9 ) . The viscosity of blood , ranging from 3 . 5 to 5 . 5 centipoise ( cP ) , is higher than that of the cell medium , which typically measures around 1 cP at 37°C . We introduced hydroxypropyl methyl - cellulose , increasing medium viscosity , up to 0 . 25 % , thereby elevating the viscosity to 9 cP ( 25 ) . The loading rate was not significantly af - fected by the viscosity in this range ( Fig . 4H ) . Collectively , we conclude that the single - molecule force loading rate through integrins is around a single piconewton per second . The loading rate in adhering monocytes was higher than in epithelial cells , suggesting their capabil - ity to swiftly assess their mechanical environ - ment during the dynamic phases of leukocyte adhesion and extravasation . We speculate that a similar range of loading rates may apply to many other mechanosensitive receptors , in - cluding cadherins , T and B cell receptors , and Notch receptors , because these receptors are also closely associated with actin filaments ( 26 – 29 ) . Notably , cadherins , which primarily Fig . 3 . OTS refreshing .

Discussion Molecular tension probes offer promise in revealing receptor - specific mechanotransduc - tion ( 30 ) but have limitations , including their narrow force measurement range , accuracy , and calibration without regard to temper - ature or loading rate . Our work demonstrates that stretching - induced oligonucleotide de - hybridization is particularly suited for devel - oping tension sensors for a wide range of force levels . Dehybridization increases the sensor ’ s length by only 3 nm for 18 - bp DNA ( 19 ) , and likely as a result , cells exhibited similar spreading across all tested OTSs , suggesting that dehy - bridization does not interfere with mechano - sensing through integrins . TheOTS can record transient or infrequent force transmission eventswithoutcontinuousilluminationoflivingcells , preventing phototoxicity . Its refreshable nature maintains sensitivity in receptor - dense and mechanically dynamic regions such as focal adhesions , extending the observation time beyond early adhesion or short - term im - aging ( 22 ) . Moreover , configuring an OTS in a serial connection opens avenues for measuring cel - lular loading rates , a pivotal parameter in cel - lular mechanics including rigidity sensing ( 31 – 34 ) , across a wide range of force . Nota - bly , force ramping events have been captured only for T cell receptors within a low - force range ( < 4 pN ) ( 35 ) . Previous studies have shown that a 10 pN integrin tension differ - ence markedly alters cell spreading ( 14 , 16 ) . Given the loading rates of 0 . 5 to 4 pN / s de - termined in our study , cells would have only a few seconds to sense the mechanical environ - ment through single integrin molecules . We measured the loading rate for ligands tethered to rigid glass by a PEG linker . On softer surfaces , the effective loading rate might be lower , as ligands tend to move in the direction of the applied force . The resulting tilt in bal - ance toward receptor – ligand unbinding before mechanical activation of integrin signaling is likely to be the fundamental mechanism un - derlying rigidity sensing ( 33 ) . Exploring loading rates is expected to un - cover cell mechanics not observable through force level measurements alone . The under - standing derived from integrin force loading rates can also be extended to the mechanics of cytoplasmic adaptor proteins . Notably , talin and filamin undergo substantial structural changes to relay force from membrane recep - torsto thecytoskeleton ( 36 ) . Magnetictweezers studies indicate that their unfolding force varies with loading rates , from 0 . 1 to 10 pN / s , a range deemed physiologically pertinent ( 37 – 39 ) . These findings , which are consistent with our mea - sured loading rates , imply that adaptor pro - teins could regulate cell adhesion by detecting integrin force loading rates .
