The main propose of this system - description paper is to facili - tate the reader with replicability and to pro - vide insightful analysis of the developed sys - tem . Here in Vista . ue , we proposed a sin - gle multilingual hate speech detection model . This model was ranked 46 / 70 for English Task A and 31 / 43 for English Task B . Vista . ue was able to rank 38 / 41 for Spanish Task A and 22 / 25 for Spanish Task B . 1 Introduction According to the article ( Bosco et al . , 2017 ) , nearly a quarter of a billion people , throughout the world , currently live in a country other than their place of birth . This is an increase of 41 % from 2000 to 2015 . This ﬁgure includes more than 21 million refugees often vulnerable and dissat - isﬁed . Since 2015 , Europe is facing an unprece - dented refugee crisis , the by - effect of the Syrian civil war and the terrible living conditions in equa - torial Africa . 1 , 300 , 000 people have generated this increased migration ﬂow to Europe which can only but increase , putting European stable soci - eties , so far , under pressure . Therefore , the implications for the European so - ciety and the way we behave towards immigra - tion , immigrant integration and social inclusion for newcomers and their children , are becoming more decisive and must be addressed either at a local or global level , considering a political and social perspective . While this phenomenon stim - ulates the generation and diffusion of hate speech and hate crimes , at the same time several initia - tives are promoted , but they should be further im - proved to increase the awareness and empathy of receiving populations while avoiding polarization against immigrants . Hate speech analysis and hate maps allow both a greater understanding of social phenomena linked to the integration of migrants , that more targeted actions to improve it . The integration of mi - grants is strongly linked to the new cultural con - text where they try to rebuild their lives . The pro - cess of acculturation depends on personal and so - cial variables of the migrant , in large part in turn dependent on the cultural context of his / her ori - gin , on the characteristics of the context of reset - tlement and on events occurring during this life period . The different migrants strategies ﬁrstly af - fect the different outcomes achieved . In particular , he can decide whether or not to maintain the cul - tural identity of origin and whether or not to es - tablish and maintain new relationships within the new contest . This gives rise to four possible dif - ferent outcomes : integration , assimilation , separa - tion / segregation , marginalization ( Berry , 1997 ) . 1 . 1 Motivation Data released by European Community about pop - ulation change ( Union , 2015 ) show that from the 1990s onwards natural population change had a di - minishing role in EU demographic developments , while the role of net migration became increas - ingly important . In the period 2011 to 2013 , net migration contributed more than 80 % to total population growth , drawing an overall pattern of growth of EUs populations driven increasingly by changes in migratory ﬂows , which hides a range of demographic situations among the EU Member States . Between 2004 and 2013 , indeed the pop - ulation of 11 EU Member States decreased , with the biggest reductions recorded in Germany and Romania , but a high overall increase in popula - tion numbers was recorded in the other countries like UK ( a gain of 4 . 51 million inhabitants ) , Spain ( 3 . 96 million ) , France ( 3 . 54 million ) and Italy ( 3 . 29 million ) . Among these countries , character - ized by a negative natural population change , also compounded by negative net migration , Italy is af - fected by a negative natural change , that was com - pletely offset by net migration which accounted for 108 % of the total population change . As a part of the motivation , we participated in the shared task named ”SemEval - 2019 Task 5 : Multilingual Detection of Hate Speech Against Immigrants and Women in Twitter” . Section 2 outlines the existing approaches in a systematic manner and the description of the task mentioned in Section 3 . Paper also provides a short , compre - hensive and structured overview of automatic hate speech detection in Section 4 followed my result comparison and conclusion in Section 5 and 6 re - spectively . 2 Related Work For any text classiﬁcation task , the most obvi - ous information to utilize is surface - level features , such as a bag of words . Indeed , unigrams and larger n - grams are included in the feature sets by a majority of authors ( Chen et al . , 2012 ; Sood et al . , 2012 ; Xu et al . , 2012 ; Warner and Hirschberg , 2012 ; Van Hee et al . , 2015 ) . These features are often reported to be highly predictive . Still , in many works , n - gram features are combined with a large selection of other features . For example , in their recent work , ( Nobata et al . , 2016 ) report that while token and character n - gram features are the most predictive single features in their exper - iments , combining them with all additional fea - tures further improves performance . Character level n - gram features might provide a way to attenuate the spelling variation problem of - ten faced when working with user - generated com - ment text . For instance , the phrase ”ki11 yrslef a $ $ hole” , which is regarded as an example of hate speech , will most likely pose problems to token based approaches since the unusual spelling vari - ations will result in very rare or even unknown tokens in the training data . While using Charac - ter level approaches , on the other hand , are more likely to capture the similarity to the canonical spelling of these tokens . Author ( Mehdad and Tetreault , 2016 ) systematically compare charac - ter n - gram features with token n - grams for hate speech detection and found that character n - grams prove to be more predictive than token n - grams . Apart from word and character based features , hate speech detection can also beneﬁt from other surface features ( Chen et al . , 2012 ; Nobata et al . , 2016 ) , such as information on the frequency of URL mentions and punctuation , comment and to - ken lengths , capitalization , words that cannot be found in English dictionaries , and the number of non - alpha numeric characters present in tokens . Hate speech and sentiment analysis are closely related , and it is safe to assume that usually , neg - ative sentiment pertains to a hate speech message . Because of this , several approaches acknowledge the relatedness of hate speech and sentiment anal - ysis by incorporating the latter as an auxiliary clas - siﬁcation . Author ( Dinakar et al . , 2012 ; Sood et al . , 2012 ; Njagi et al . , 2015 ) followed a mul - tistep approach in which a classiﬁer dedicated to detect negative polarity is applied prior to the clas - siﬁer speciﬁcally checking for evidence of hate speech . Further , ( Njagi et al . , 2015 ) run an addi - tional classiﬁer that weeds out non - subjective sen - tences prior to the aforementioned polarity classi - ﬁcation . 3 Task Description and Dataset The main task ( Basile et al . , 2019 ) was to detect Hate Speech in Twitter toward two different tar - gets , immigrants and women . The data were avail - able in a multilingual perspective , English , and Spanish . 3 . 1 Task Description The task was partition into two groups : Task A and Task B . Making a total of four subtasks ( En - glish / Spanish task A / B ) . TASK A - Hate Speech ( HS ) Detection against Immigrants and Women : a two - class ( or bi - nary ) classiﬁcation where systems have to predict whether a tweet in English or in Spanish with a given target ( women or immigrants ) is hateful or not hateful . TASK B - Aggressive behavior ( AG ) and Target Classiﬁcation ( TR ) : where systems are asked ﬁrst to classify hateful tweets for English and Spanish ( e . g . , tweets , where Hate Speech against women or immigrants has been identiﬁed , ) as aggressive or not aggressive , and second to identify the tar - get harassed as individual or generic ( i . e . single human or group ) . A binary value ( 1 / 0 ) indicating if HS is occur - ring against one of the given targets ( women or immigrants ) . If HS occurs ( i . e . the value for the feature at point HS is 1 ) , a binary value indicat - ing if the target is a generic group of people ( 0 ) or a speciﬁc individual ( 1 ) denoted as TR . And if HS occurs ( i . e . the value for the feature at point HS is 1 ) , a binary value indicating if the tweeter is aggressive ( 1 ) or not ( 0 ) denoted as AG . Thus , making 3 columns ( named HS , TR and , AG ) for each tweet . 3 . 2 Dataset As per detail provided by the organizing commit - tee , all data for the competition were collected from Twitter and manually annotated mainly via the ”Figur8 crowdsourcing platform” . The Table 1 describes the distribution of the dataset . Language Task Train Dev Test English A 9000 1000 3000 English B 9000 1000 3000 Spanish A 5000 500 1600 Spanish B 5000 500 1600 Table 1 : Task Dataset Distribution .

This is done with the help of regular expression . r " http \ S + " , " url " , tweet 4 . 2 Experimental Setup Here , a common architecture is used for all the four subtasks . The only difference is the hyper - parameter . The Table 4 shows the experimental parameter values . Task Paramter Value EN / ES - A / B batch size 1 EN / ES - A / B epochs 2 EN / ES - A / B optimizer Adam EN / ES - A / B validation split 0 . 20 Table 4 : Experimental Parameter . 4 . 3 Single Multilingual System Architecture Author ( Raiyani et al . , 2018 ) have used simple feedforward dense architecture and able to achieve beyond the average result for ﬁnding aggression over social media ( Facebook and Twitter ) . In par - ticular , their model was able to stand the best performing model for English Tweets . Using a similar architectural concept , here , we are using a character - based dictionary . First of all , all the unique characters from the dataset are stored in the form of a dictionary . Then , using this dictionary , each character in the dataset are replaced by its key value . Thus , this transforms the dataset into an integer from the text . Finally , this integer data is further transformed into a binary array and fed to the Dense architecture . The Figure 1 shows the ﬂowchart of system process . Where as the Figure 2 shows the Dense Architecture . Figure 1 : System Flowchart . To store the intermediate character into the dic - tionary , pika library 1 was used . The number of unique characters found for English and Spanish 1 https : / / pika . readthedocs . io / en / stable / is respectively 169 and 172 ( this also includes all the special character and emojis ) . Figure 2 : Feedforward Dense Architecture . The architectural hyper parameter were selected based on trail and run . The same can be found in the Table 5 . The code of the entire task could be found in the online GitHub repository ( Raiyani , 2019 ) .

In the next section we will talk about the system performance and its global standing in the task . 5 Result Comparison and Discussion The Table 6 shows the English task A average precision , recall , and F1 measure in reference to the baseline ( SVC and MFC ) . The same for Span - ish task A is found in the Table 7 . The Table 8 shows the F1 measure over all the three param - eter ( namely , Hate Speech ( HS ) , Target Classiﬁ - cation ( TR ) , and Aggressive ( AG ) ) . The ranking of task B is done using the value of Exact Match Ra - tio ( EMR ) ( the evaluation formula could be found here 2 ) . The Table 9 shows the EMR value in ref - erence to the baseline SVC and MFC . The provided ﬁnal ranking among all the sub - tasks are shown in Table 10 . 6 Conclusion and Future Work In this system description paper , we presented a single multilingual model for hate speech detec - tion among immigrant and women .

Further , We consider that our system can be grown , mainly due to the following facts : ( 1 ) The system does not count any NLP feature into account ( 2 ) Due to this , many hate tweets are missed . ( 3 ) Especially , for task B , features like Part of Speech ( POS ) tagging and Entity Extrac - tion ( EE ) can improve the result . Lastly , how to address these aspects and generate a more accu - rate , comprehensive and ﬁne - grained hate speech detection remains our further work .
