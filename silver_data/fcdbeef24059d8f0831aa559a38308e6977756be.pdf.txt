SH3 domains of yeast and amoeboid myosins I interact with activators of the Arp2 / 3 complex , an important regulator of actin polymerization . No binding partners for the SH3 domains of myosins I have been identified in higher eukaryotes . In the current study , we show that two proteins with prominent functions in endocytosis , synaptojanin - 1 and dynamin , bind to the SH3 domain of human Myo1E . Myosin 1E colocalizes with clathrin - and dynamin - containing puncta at the plasma membrane and this co - localization requires an intact SH3 domain . Expression of Myo1E tail , which acts in a dominant - negative manner , inhibits endocytosis of transferrin . Our findings suggest that myosin 1E may contribute to receptor - mediated endocytosis . Keywords myosin ; dynamin ; synaptojanin ; endocytosis ; SH3 domain INTRODUCTION Class I myosins are actin - dependent molecular motors expressed in various organisms from yeast to humans . All class I myosins contain a head ( motor ) domain , a light chain - binding neck domain , and a tail , which can be either short , consisting only of a membrane - binding tail homology ( TH ) - 1 domain , or long , with a proline - rich TH2 domain and an SH3 domain in addition to TH1 . In humans and mice , there are eight myosin I ( Myo1 ) heavy chain genes , two of which , Myo1E and F , are long tailed [ 1 , 2 ] . Long - tailed Myo1s are found in both lower and higher eukaryotes . Long - tailed yeast and amoeboid Myo1s interact with activators of the Arp2 / 3 complex , an important regulator of actin polymerization , and are involved in actin reorganization and endocytosis [ 3 - 9 ] . In budding yeast , inactivation of Myo1 isoforms ( Myo3p and Myo5p ) leads to defects in endocytosis [ 3 ] . In Acanthamoeba , various Myo1 isoforms are found in association with 2Current address - The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , MA , 02139 # Corresponding author .

In Dictyostelium , long - tailed Myo1s ( myo B , C , and D ) are required for fluid - phase endocytosis [ 11 ] . Myo1e , the mouse homolog of the human long - tailed myosin , Myo1E ( formerly referred to as Myo1C under the old myosin nomenclature [ 12 ] ) , has been previously localized to phagocytic structures [ 13 ] . In this study , we report that Myo1E binds to two proline - rich proteins , synaptojanin - 1 and dynamin , via its SH3 domain , and can be observed to co - localize with dynamin by immunofluorescence microscopy . Synaptojanin - 1 and dynamin are involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and our observations of live cells using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy microscopy ( TIRF ) indicate that Myo1E colocalizes with clathrin - and dynamin - containing puncta at the plasma membrane . Expression of Myo1E tail , which acts in a dominant - negative manner , inhibits endocytosis of transferrin , which suggests that interaction of Myo1E with endocytic proteins may play an important role in receptor - mediated endocytosis . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials Antibodies : rabbit anti - Myo1E [ 14 ] , mouse monoclonal anti - myc ( Zymed ) , rabbit anti - dynamin - 2 ( Oncogene ) , mouse anti - dynamin Hudy - 1 ( Upstate ) , anti - GFP ( Molecular Probes ) . Secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa - 488 and - 568 were purchased from Molecular Probes . Cloning and recombinant protein expression All constructs were produced using PCR cloning and vectors pEGFP - C1 and pLNCX2 - EGFP ( BD Biosciences Clontech ) . Primers used to subclone Myo1E tail ( including TH1 , TH2 , and SH3 domains ) flank AA 710 - 1109 , primers for subcloning TH1 domain surround AA 717 - 920 , TH2 domain – AA 913 - 1060 , TH3 domain - AA 1052 - 1109 . GST - tagged proteins were expressed using vector pGEX - 5X - 3 and affinity - purified according to standard protocols . HeLa and Cos - 1 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and transfected using Lipofectamine . Yeast two - hybrid screening A Myo1E tail fragment ( TH2 + SH3 ) subcloned into pGBKT7 - BD vector using primers flanking aa 915 - 1109 was used to screen pretransformed human kidney Matchmaker cDNA library ( Clontech ) following the manufacturer’s protocol . Positive clones were isolated and verified by mating with yeast strains containing empty vector , lamin C ( negative control ) , or Myo1E bait construct ( see Fig . 1 ) . Synaptojanin - 1 fragment identified using yeast two - hybrid represents a splice form that has previously been isolated from embryonic muscle cells ( Genbank accession number DQ421853 . 1 ) . Binding and immunoprecipitation assays Pull - down of proteins from rat brain extracts was performed as described [ 15 ] . For pull - downs from HeLa or Cos - 1 cells , cells were lysed in 20 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 75 mM KCl , 1 mM EGTA , 2 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 % NP - 40 and centrifuged for 15 min . at 16 , 000 g . The supernatant was incubated with GST - tagged proteins and glutathione agarose for 3 hrs at 4°C . Beads were washed 4 times with phosphate - buffered saline containing 1 % Triton X - 100 . Synaptojanin - 1 and dynamin were purified from rat brain essentially as described [ 16 ] except that 20 mM Pipes pH 6 . 5 , 1 . 2 M NaCl , 1 mM EDTA was used to elute bound dynamin and synaptojanin - 1 from endophilin - SH3 - beads and a Source 15Q FPLC column ( Amersham ) eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0 . 3 M NaCl was used to separate dynamin from synaptojanin - 1 .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t were incubated for 2 hrs at 4°C . The bead pellets and unbound proteins were separated by centrifugation and processed for SDS - PAGE . Deoxycholate - solublized , synapse - enriched rat brain extracts were prepared essentially as described [ 17 ] . Extracts were pre - cleared with 1 / 10 volume protein - A - Sepharose ( Amersham ) 1 hr at 4°C , and incubated with 100 μ g / ml anti - Myo1E antibody or rabbit IgG overnight at 4° C . Protein - A - Sepharose ( blocked with 5 % BSA ) was added at 1 / 10 dilution , and incubated 1 hr at 4°C . Pellets were washed 7×5 min with 10 mg / L BSA , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 M KCl , 5 mM Mg - ATP , 1 mM Pefabloc , 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and processed for SDS - PAGE . TIRF microscopy Swiss3T3 cells stably expressing DsRed - clathrin were cultured in DMEM / 10 % FBS the presence of 0 . 5 mg / ml G - 418 . Cells were transiently transfected with EGFP - tagged myosin constructs using 3 . 4 μ g total DNA and 10 μ l Lipofectamine 2000 per 35 mm dish . For analysis of dynamin and Myo1E localization , untransfected Swiss3T3 cells were transiently transfected with EGFP - Myo1E and mRFP - dynamin - 1 as described above . Cells were trypsinized and replated onto 35 - mm glass - bottom dishes ( Well - Co , Warner Instruments , Hamden , CT ) 3 hrs post - transfection and imaged the following day using a Nikon Eclipse 2000 multimode TIRF microscope prototype . During imaging cells were maintained in DMEM containing 25 mM HEPES and no phenol red supplemented with 5 % FBS , using a dish warmer ( Warner Instruments ) to maintain 37°C temperature . For analysis of Myo1E and clathrin colocalization , green and red channels for a single frame from each time - lapse movie were examined separately using ImageJ , and each distinct fluorescent punctum was manually marked . The two sets of marked images were then superimposed , and puncta that appeared in both channels , as well as puncta that were present only in the red or only in the green channels , were counted . At least three separate dishes of cells were examined for each construct . Transferrin internalization Internalization assays using Alexa - 568 - transferrin were performed as described [ 18 ] except that PBS ( pH 4 ) was used in place of citrate buffer to remove surface - bound transferrin . Image collection was performed using Bio - Rad 1024 confocal microscope . For the analysis of transferrin uptake in cells expressing EGFP - tagged Myo1E tail constructs , images of at least 100 EGFP - expressing cells were collected for each construct , and cells that exhibited punctate transferrin labeling were counted as positive and cells that did not contain distinct transferrin puncta counted as negative . Immunofluorescence microscopy For immunofluorescence staining , cells were plated onto acid - washed coverslips and fixed using pH - shift fixation as described in [ 19 ] . Anti - Myo1E polyclonal antibody and Hudy - 1 monoclonal antibody were used to label Myo1E and dynamin , respectively . RESULTS Identification of synaptojanin - 1 as a Myo1E - binding protein using yeast two - hybrid screening The tail of Myo1E contains a positively charged TH1 domain , a proline - rich TH2 region , and an SH3 domain , which may interact with proline - rich motif - containing proteins ( Figure 1A ) . To identify proteins binding to the tail of Myo1E , we conducted a yeast two - hybrid screen of a human kidney cDNA library using Myo1E tail fragment containing TH2 and SH3 regions as a bait ( Figure 1B ) . This screen identified a cDNA fragment corresponding to the C - terminal portion of synaptojanin - 1 , a lipid phosphatase implicated in synaptic vesicle trafficking [ 20 ] . Krendel et al .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Specificity of the two hybrid interaction was verified by examining interaction of synaptojanin - 1 with a negative control protein ( Lamin C ) ( Fig . 1C ) . Synaptojanin - 1 contains an N - terminal region homologous to yeast inositol phosphatase Sac1p , a central inositol 5 - phosphatase domain , and a C - terminal proline - rich domain ( PRD ) that is involved in interactions with SH3 domain - containing proteins ( Figure 1B ) . Two isoforms of synaptojanin - 1 generated by alternative splicing have been described : a 145 kD isoform expressed primarily in adult neurons and a 170 kD isoform that is more ubiquitously expressed [ 21 ] . The two isoforms differ by the presence of several additional proline - rich motifs in the p170 isoform and by distinct membrane - binding properties . The synaptojanin - 1 fragment identified in the screen corresponds to the longer , 170 kD , splice form of human synaptojanin - 1 and includes a small portion of the inositol 5 - phosphatase domain and the entire PRD ( Figure 1B ) . Synaptojanin - 1 and dynamin bind to the SH3 domain of Myo1E In order to verify Myo1E - synaptojanin - 1 interactions , GST - tagged SH3 domain of human Myo1E was used to pull down proteins from rat brain extracts . Synaptojanin - 1 bound to GST - SH3 but not to GST alone ( Figure 2A ) . GST - tagged SH3 domain of endophilin - 1 , a known binding partner of synaptojanin - 1 [ 15 ] , was used as a positive control . In addition to the synaptojanin - 1 band , both Myo1E and endophilin pull down reactions contained bands of ∼ 100 kD , the molecular weight of the known endophilin binding protein dynamin [ 15 ] . Immunoblot analysis revealed that both dynamin - 1 and – 2 were present in protein complexes bound to Myo1E and endophilin ( Figure 2A ) . Thus , our data indicate that both long ( 170 kDa ) and short ( 145 kDa , brain - specific ) isoforms of synaptojanin - 1 , as well as dynamins 1 and 2 , interact with Myo1E . To determine whether interactions of Myo1E SH3 domain with synaptojanin - 1 and dynamin were direct and independent of each other , we analyzed binding of synaptojanin - 1 and dynamin purified from rat brain to GST - SH3 ( Figure 2B ) . GST - SH3 was able to independently bind to purified synaptojanin - 1 and dynamin , confirming that both synaptojanin - 1 and dynamin bind directly to the SH3 domain of Myo1E . Binding of synaptojanin - 1 , dynamin - 1 , and dynamin - 2 to Myo1E SH3 was further confirmed in binding assays , in which GST - SH3 was used to pull down overexpressed human dynamin - 1 , dynamin - 2 , or synaptojanin - 1 ( C - terminal portion of the kidney isoform ) or endogenous dynamin - 2 from cell lysates ( Figure 2C ) . To verify the importance of the SH3 domain - PRD interaction for Myo1E binding to synaptojanin and dynamin , we introduced a W1089K mutation in the SH3 domain of Myo1E to replace a conserved tryptophan in the hydrophobic groove of the SH3 domain with a positively charged lysine [ 22 ] . This mutation disrupted interactions of Myo1E SH3 domain with both synaptojanin - 1 and dynamin ( Figure 2 ) . Thus , Myo1E interactions with synaptojanin - 1 and dynamin involve conserved residues in the SH3 domain and are likely to occur via PRDs in dynamin and synaptojanin - 1 . To determine whether Myo1E forms complexes with synaptojanin - 1 and dynamin in vivo , we immunoprecipitated Myo1E from a synapse - rich fraction of rat brain . Synaptojanin - 1 and dynamin are highly expressed at synapses , and we find that Myo1E is enriched over total brain homogenate in this synapse - rich fraction ( E . K . O . , unpublished observations ) . Myo1E co - immunoprecipitated with synaptojanin - 1 and both dynamin - 1 and dynamin - 2 ( Figure 3 ) . Myo1E co - localizes with clathrin - coated and dynamin - containing vesicles Since the binding experiments described above indicated that Myo1E interacts with dynamin and synaptojanin , two proteins that are involved in clathrin - dependent endocytosis , we sought to determine whether Myo1E colocalizes with clathrin associated endocytic structures at the plasma membrane . Previously , TIRF microscopy of live DsRed - clathrin - expressing Swiss 3T3 Krendel et al . Page 4 FEBS Lett . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2008 February 20 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t cells has been successfully used to analyze recruitment of endocytosis - related proteins to clathrin - containing puncta at the plasma membrane ( presumably coated pits and newly formed vesicles ) [ 23 , 24 ] . TIRF microscopy was used to examine localization of EGFP - tagged Myo1E or Myo1E tail in DsRed - clathrin expressing Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts . DsRed - clathrin and EGFP - Myo1E ( or EGFP - Myo1E - tail ) localized to puncta on the bottom surface of the cells ( Figure 4 ) . In cells co - expressing clathrin and Myo1E , 34 . 6 % of all clathrin - positive puncta contained Myo1E . Interestingly , the degree of co - localization of Myo1E tail with clathrin was higher than that of full - length Myo1E with clathrin ( Figure 4 ) , possibly reflecting the fact that in the absence of a functional motor domain Myo1E persists in clathrin - coated structures for prolonged time periods . Co - localization of Myo1E tail with clathrin was lower in cells expressing Myo1E tail with mutant SH3 domain that does not bind dynamin and synaptojanin ( Figure 4 ) . While the presence of the functional SH3 domain was important for proper localization of Myo1E tail , it was not sufficient , since the isolated SH3 domain was mostly diffuse and showed a very low degree of co - localization with clathrin puncta ( Figure 4 ) . A tail construct consisting of TH2 and SH3 domains also showed lower degree of co - localization with clathrin than full - length Myo1E tail ( Figure 4 A , B ) . Thus , in addition to the interaction of the SH3 domain with dynamin and / or synaptojanin , the interaction of the positively charged TH1 domain with membrane phospholipids may play an important role in recruitment of Myo1E to clathrin - coated pits and / or vesicles . However , TH1 domain alone was not sufficient for co - localization with clathrin puncta ( Figure 4 A , B ) . In addition , neither EGFP - tagged Myo1A , which possesses only a positively charged TH1 domain but no TH2 or SH3 domains , nor EGFP - tagged Myo1A tail ( TH1 ) localized to clathrin containing puncta ( data not shown ) , further confirming that TH2 and SH3 domains may contribute to proper localization of Myo1E . We also used TIRF microscopy to determine whether Myo1E is present on dynamin - containing vesicles in live cells . In Swiss3T3 cells transfected with RFP - dynamin - 1 and EGFP - Myo1E , Myo1E co - localized with dynamin - containing endocytic structures ( Figure 4C ) . Using immunofluorescence labeling of fixed cells , we also observed co - localization of EGFP - Myo1E - tail and endogenous Myo1E with endogenously expressed dynamin ( Figure 5 ) . Only a small fraction of Myo1E - positive puncta was observed to co - localize with dynamin by immunofluorescence ; this suggests that it is difficult to detect transient interactions of Myo1E with endocytic vesicles using antibody staining of fixed cells . These observations confirm that Myo1E interacts in vivo with dynamin molecules assembled on endocytic structures at the plasma membrane , such as clathrin - coated pits and budding vesicles . Since synaptojanin - 1 is expressed in non - neuronal cells at extremely low levels and , unlike dynamin , its localization in live non - neuronal cells is unknown , we did not examine Myo1E localization in Swiss3T3 or HeLa cells relative to synaptojanin - 1 localization . Expression of Myo1E tail inhibits receptor - mediated endocytosis To determine whether interactions of Myo1E with its tail - binding partners play a role in endocytosis , we examined uptake of fluorescent transferrin in HeLa cells expressing EGFP - tagged fragments of Myo1E tail , which can act in a dominant - negative fashion by displacing endogenous Myo1E ( Figure 6 ) . While almost all control cells exhibited punctate transferrin labeling , ∼ 80 % of cells expressing Myo1E tail did not take up transferrin ( Figure 6B ) . Presumably , the tail domain displaces endogenous motor by competing with tail - binding partners that may be required for Myo1E localization and / or function in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Replacement of the conserved tryptophan in the SH3 domain with a lysine ( W1089K mutation ) , which abolishes interactions with synaptojanin and dynamin , reduced the ability of Myo1E tail to inhibit transferrin internalization ( Figure 6B ) , indicating that SH3 domain interactions are important for Myo1E functions . On the other hand , expression of the Krendel et al . Page 5 FEBS Lett . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2008 February 20 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t isolated SH3 domain did not inhibit transferrin uptake , suggesting that TH1 and / or TH2 domains , which contribute to Myo1E localization to clathrin - coated vesicles , may be necessary to completely displace endogenous Myo1E . Additionally , this observation indicates that inhibition of transferrin uptake by Myo1E DN - tail is not due solely to the SH3 domain sequestering the Myo1E interacting proteins dynamin and synaptojanin but rather due to specific displacement of endogenous Myo1E . DISCUSSION Formation of endocytic vesicles at the plasma membrane involves multiple transient interactions between proteins involved in invagination of clathrin - coated pits , vesicle scission , and vesicle uncoating . Assembly of protein complexes during endocytosis relies to a large extent on interactions between SH3 domains and PRDs , which are found in many endocytic proteins . In the present study , we describe binding of two PRD - containing endocytic proteins , dynamin and synaptojanin - 1 , to the SH3 domain of Myo1E . This interaction was detected both in vitro , using pull - downs of purified proteins , and in vivo , using immunoprecipitation of protein complexes from synapse - enriched brain extract and immunolocalization of Myo1E and dynamin . Our observation of the interaction between human Myo1E and endocytic proteins suggests that this longtailed myosin may play a role in clathrin - dependent endocytosis . Involvement of longtailed class I myosin in endocytosis has been previously demonstrated for yeast myosins [ 3 , 7 - 9 ] , but not for their mammalian homologs . Recently mouse myosin Myo1f , which is closely related to Myo1E , was shown to regulate presentation of cell adhesion receptors , integrins , on the surface of neutrophils [ 25 ] , suggesting that long - tailed class I myosins in mammals may contribute to both endo - and exocytosis of cell surface receptors . Interaction between Myo1E SH3 domain and PRD - containing endocytic proteins may promote recruitment of Myo1E to clathrin - coated structures since an inactivating mutation in the SH3 domain reduced Myo1E localization to clathrin - containing puncta . However , the SH3 domain alone was not sufficient for localization to clathrin - coated vesicles , since removal of the TH1 and TH2 domain abolished vesicular localization . The positively - charged TH1 domain in Myo1E tail may contribute to its localization to the endocytic machinery through interactions with acidic phospholipids or , as has been shown for Myo1A , through interactions with TH - 1 binding proteins [ 19 ] . The observed role for the SH3 domain in Myo1E localization is reminiscent of findings in budding yeast where SH3 domain of Myo5p is required but not sufficient for polarized localization to cortical patches in the bud [ 26 ] . Expression of Myo1E tail in HeLa cells inhibited endocytic uptake of transferrin , which occurs via receptor - mediated endocytosis . This observation suggests that Myo1E tail can act in a dominant - negative manner by displacing endogenous Myo1E , and that disruption of Myo1E interactions with tail - binding proteins inhibits clathrin - dependent endocytosis . An intact SH3 domain and TH1 domain were necessary for the efficient inhibition of transferrin uptake . Thus , both protein - protein interactions mediated by the SH3 domain and membrane binding promoted by the TH1 domain may be important for Myo1E functions in endocytosis . A potential contribution of Myo1E to endocytosis is further substantiated by the observation that mouse Myo1e localizes to the intermicrovillar region of the intestinal brush border , a region characterized by active endocytosis ( M . K . and M . S . M . , unpublished observations ) . There are a number of potential functional roles for the SH3 mediated interaction of Myo1E with synaptojanin - 1 and dynamin . Synaptojanin - 1 or dynamin may serve as docking sites for Myo1E on the coated pit / vesicle for functions that are independent of the activities of these two proteins . Myo1E may then facilitate coated vesicle formation by remodeling the cortical actin network and / or transporting vesicles away from the plasma membrane and toward the endosomal compartments . Alternatively , Myo1E may regulate dynamin functions during Krendel et al . Page 6 FEBS Lett . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2008 February 20 .

Some known examples of regulation of the activity of these proteins by their binding partners include upregulation of GTPase activity of dynamin by binding to SNX9 [ 27 ] and activation of phosphatase activity of synaptojanin by binding to the SH3 domain of endophilin [ 16 ] . An intriguing possibility is that binding of dynamin and synaptojanin to Myo1E tail may activate motor activity since it has been demonstrated that Myo1E ATPase activity is autoinhibited by its SH3 domain [ 28 ] . Disruption of actin cytoskeletal dynamics inhibits fission and internalization of clathrin - coated vesicles [ 29 ] ; therefore , as an actin - dependent motor localized to clathrin - coated vesicles , Myo1E may play an important role in vesicle formation and internalization .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Figure 1 . Myo1E tail structure and identification of tail - binding proteins using yeast two - hybrid screen . A . The domain structure of Myo1E and the tail constructs used to investigate Myo1E localization . Myo1E heavy chain is composed of an N - terminal motor domain , a neck domain with a single IQ light chain binding motif , and a tail domain . Myo1E tail consists of a positively charged TH1 domain , a proline - rich TH2 , and an SH3 ( TH3 ) domain [ 2 ] . B . Myo1E construct used as a bait for the yeast two - hybrid screening consists of TH2 and SH3 domain . Synaptojanin - 1 ( SJ - 1 ) contains two phosphatase domains ( Sac1 - homology and inositol - 5 - phopshatase ) and a C - terminal PRD . Synaptojanin - 1 fragment isolated in the yeast two hybrid screen includes a portion of the inositol 5 - phosphatase domain and the PRD . C . Interaction of Myo1E with SJ - 1 in a yeast two - hybrid assay . Yeast clone containing both Myo1E bait construct and SJ - 1 construct exhibits signs of a positive interaction : the ability to grow on the nutrient - deficient medium and development of blue color due to ß - galactosidase reaction . Negative controls ( Myo1E bait plus empty vector , SJ - 1 construct plus empty vector , SJ - 1 construct plus non - interacting protein ( Lamin C ) ) do not grow on the nutrient - deficient medium .

Myo1E binding proteins from rat brain extracts . Immunoblot analysis indicates that both GST - tagged Myo1E SH3 and endophilin - SH3 but not GST alone bind synaptojanin - 1 ( SJ - 1 ) , dynamin - 1 , and dynamin - 2 ( Dyn - 1 , 2 ) . A Coomassie stained gel showing the amount of GST fusion proteins used for pulldowns is shown in the lower panel ( GST fusions ) . B . Binding of purified synaptojanin - 1 and dynamin to Myo1E SH3 domain . SDS - PAGE of glutathione - bead pellet ( P ) and supernatant ( S ) fractions followed by Coomassie staining indicates that GST - tagged Myo1E SH3 but not mutant SH3 or GST bind purified synaptojanin - 1 and dynamin . Note that mobility shift of dynamin band in lane 3 ( SH3 pellet ) is a gel artifact caused by the difference in total protein load between the lanes . Right - hand panels show Coomassie stained gels of the purified synaptojanin - 1 and dynamin preparations used . C . Binding of synaptojanin - 1 , dynamin - 1 , and dynamin - 2 expressed in cultured cells to Myo1E SH3 . Cos - 1 cells transfected with EGFP - tagged dynamin - 1 or myc - tagged synaptojanin - 1 ( partial clone isolated from the kidney cDNA library ) , HeLa cells transfected with untagged dynamin - 2 or non - transfected HeLa cells were lysed and cell lysates were incubated with GST - tagged proteins as indicated . Immunoblots indicated that overexpressed synaptojanin - 1 and dynamin - 1 and - 2 as well as endogenous dynamin - 2 ( End . Dyn - 2 ) from HeLa lysate bound to GST - SH3 but not pure GST or mutant SH3 ( SH3 WK ) . Lower panels show Coomassie stained gels of the GST fusions used . Krendel et al . Page 10 FEBS Lett .
