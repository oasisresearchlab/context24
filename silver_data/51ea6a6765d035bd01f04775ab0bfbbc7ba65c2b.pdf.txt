Darnay 1 1 Department of Experimental Therapeutics , The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , Texas 77030 2 Department of Biochemistry , Weill Medical College of Cornell University , New York , NY 10021 Abstract Transforming growth factor - β activated kinase 1 ( TAK1 ) , a member of the MAPKKK family , was initially described to play an essential role in the TGF beta - signaling pathway , but recent evidence has emerged implicating TAK1 in the IL - 1 and TNF pathways . Notably , two homologous proteins , TAB2 and TAB3 , have been identified as adaptors linking TAK1 to the upstream adaptors TRAFs . However , it remains unclear whether the interaction between TAB2 / TAB3 and TAK1 is necessary for its kinase activation and subsequent activation of the IKK and MAPK pathways . Here , we characterized the TAB2 / TAB3 - binding domain in TAK1 and further examined the requirement of this interaction for IL - 1 , TNF , and RANKL signaling . Through deletion mapping experiments , we demonstrated that the binding motif for TAB2 / TAB2 is a non - contiguous region located within the last C - terminal 100 residues of TAK1 . However , residues 479 – 553 of TAK1 appear to be necessary and sufficient for TAB2 / TAB3 interaction . Conversely , residues 574 – 693 of TAB2 were shown to interact with TAK1 . A green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) fusion protein containing the last 100 residues of TAK1 ( TAK1 - C100 ) abolished the interaction of endogenous TAB2 / TAB3 with TAK1 , the phosphorylation of TAK1 and prevented the activation of IKK and MAPK induced by IL - 1 , TNF , and RANKL . Furthermore , TAK1 - C100 blocked RANKL - induced nuclear accumulation of NFATc1 and consequently osteoclast differentiation consistent with the ability of a catalytically inactive TAK1 to block RANKL - mediated signaling . Significantly , our study provides evidence that the TAB2 / TAB3 interaction with TAK1 is crucial for the activation of signaling cascades mediated by IL - 1 , TNF , and RANKL .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t cytokines induce a cascade of signaling events leading to the activation of transcription factors such as NF - κ B and AP1 through upstream kinases including I κ B kinase ( IKK ) and the mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ; JNK , p38 , and ERK ) . These events culminate in the expression and regulation of numerous pro - inflammatory genes ( 1 , 2 ) . Transforming growth factor - β - activated kinase 1 ( TAK1 ) , a member of the MAP3K family , was initially identified as a kinase in TGF - β signaling ( 3 ) . Recent evidence has emerged indicating that TAK1 is involved in various signaling pathways , including IL - 1 , IL - 18 , TNF , and receptor activator of NF - κ B ligand ( RANKL ) ( 4 – 7 ) . Since TAK1 has the capacity to be activated by various cytokines , upstream adaptor molecules are critical in providing the selectivity of initiating distinct signaling events upon receptor activation . Members of the TNF - receptor - associated factor ( TRAF ) family of adaptor proteins are involved in coupling activated TNF and IL - 1 receptors to NF - κ B and MAPKs pathways ( 8 – 11 ) . Although TRAF proteins have no known enzymatic activity , recent evidence indicates that they act as E3s through their N - terminal really interesting new gene ( RING ) domain ( 12 – 14 ) . RING - type E3s contain a series of Cys and His residues distinctly separated to constitute a novel Zn - binding domain . TRAF6 together with the heterodimeric E2 complex ( Ubc13 / Uev1A ) facilitates the synthesis of unique Lys63 ( K63 ) - linked poly - ubiquitin chains on itself , rather than the conventional Lys48 ( K48 ) - linked poly - ubiquitin chains that target proteins for degradation . This unique K63 - linked poly - ubiquitin chain likely provides a scaffold to recruit downstream effector molecules to activate various signaling components . TAK1 - binding protein 2 ( TAB2 ) , or its homologue TAB3 , appears to be the adaptor molecule linking these TRAF molecules to activate TAK1 ( 15 – 19 ) . Both TAB2 and TAB3 contain a highly conserved C - terminal novel zinc finger ( NZF ) domain , which binds preferentially to K63 - linked poly - ubiquitin chains ( 20 ) ( B . G . D . , unpublished observations ) . Mutation of this Zn - finger domain abolishes the ability of TAB2 and TAB3 to bind to poly - ubiquitin chains , as well as their ability to activate TAK1 that appears to be a ubiquitin - dependent kinase of MKK and IKK ( 21 ) . However , the mechanism by which the poly - ubiquitination events induce TAK1 activation has yet to be determined . Following IL - 1 , TNF , or LPS stimulation , two possible TAK1 complexes exist , one which consists of TAB2 - TAK1 - TAB1 and another which consists of TAB3 - TAK1 - TAB1 that causes the activation of MAPKs and NF - κ B pathways ( 18 , 21 ) . These data suggest that TAB2 and TAB3 may play redundant roles in TAK1 activation ( 18 ) . Consistent with this hypothesis , activation of NF - κ B and MAPKs pathways by IL - 1 and TNF is intact in TAB2 - deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) ( 22 ) ( A . B . , unpublished observations ) . Additionally , knockdown of both TAB2 / TAB3 by siRNA results in complete loss of TAK1 activation ( 19 ) . While it appears that TAK1 activation requires poly - ubiquitination of TRAF6 and RIP1 in the IL - 1 and TNF pathways , respectively , the precise role of TAB2 / TAB3 in TAK1 activation has not been clearly investigated . Furthermore , the dissection of the respective roles of TAB2 and TAB3 in regulating TAK1 signaling is prevented due to the compensatory nature of these proteins . The development of a construct that could ablate the functional interaction of both TAB2 / TAB3 with TAK1 could be an alternative strategy to examine the functional role of TAB2 / TAB3 in regulating TAK1 - dependent signaling . In this study , we demonstrated that the binding motif for TAB2 / TAB3 on TAK1 is a non - contiguous region within the last C - terminal 100 residues of TAK1 ( TAK1 - C100 ) , and more specifically encompassing residues 479 – 553 of TAK1 . Furthermore , TAK1 - C100 prevented endogenous interaction of TAB2 and TAK1 , and blocked IL - 1 and TNF signaling . Additionally , we show the requirement of TAK1 kinase activity in RANKL signaling and Besse et al . Page 2 J Biol Chem . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2011 October 18 .

Notably , we demonstrate that TAK1 - C100 abolishes RANKL - mediated activation of IKK and JNK , nuclear accumulation of NFATc1 , and terminal osteoclast differentiation . Our results reveal the critical function of the TAB2 / TAB3 and TAK1 interaction for eliciting TAK1 - dependent signals generated by the cytokines IL - 1 , TNF , and RANKL .

The various C - terminal truncated forms of TAK1 Δ 1 - Δ 5 were generated by PCR using gene specific primers containing Eco RI ( 5 ′ ) and Bam HI ( 3 ′ ) sites that was subsequently digested and cloned into p3XFLAG - CMV - 14 . To generate the fragments encoding residues 479 – 579 ( TAK1 - Δ 6 ) and 479 – 513 ( TAK1 - Δ 7 ) , we performed PCR with gene specific primers containing Sca I ( 5 ′ ) and Bam HI ( 3 ′ ) sites and after digesting with the appropriate enzymes , the fragments were fused to the sequence encoding residues 1 – 300 of TAK1 and inserted into p3XFLAG - CMV - 14 .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t cDNA was purchased from ATCC ( Rockville , MD ) and initially cloned into a pCR3 - T7 vector using Bam HI ( 5 ′ ) and Not I ( 3 ′ ) sites . We subcloned it from pCR3 - T7 - TAB3 into pGEX - KG between Bam HI ( 5 ′ ) and a blunted Sal I ( 3 ′ ) site . Expression vectors encoding FLAG - RANK , FLAG - TRAF6 , GST - I κ B α , and GST - cJun have been previously described ( 28 , 29 ) . All constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing . Recombinant Proteins Purification of all GST fusion proteins has been previously described ( 28 , 29 ) . Recombinant RANKL has been previously described ( 24 , 25 ) . Isothermal Titration Calorimetry ( ITC ) and Data Analysis Prior to analysis , purified GST fusion proteins consisting of TAK1 ( 479 – 579 ) and TAB2 ( 574 – 693 ) in which the GST portion was cleaved with thrombin were further purified by gel filtration ( Superdex 200 ) . Following overnight dialysis with identical buffer ( 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM tris ( 2 - carboxyethel ) phosphine hydrochloride ) , the protein was concentrated in Amicon Ultra - 4 tubes ( Millipore ) with a 5 - kDa molecular mass cutoff . ITC measurements were performed at 25°C using a VP - ITC machine that was connected to a computer with ORIGIN software ( Microcal Inc , Northampton , MA ) . Prior to titration , protein samples were centrifuged at 10 , 000 r . p . m . at 4°C for 10 min and degassed by vacuum aspiration for ~ 10 min . The calorimeter cell and titration syringe were extensively rinsed with dialysis buffer ( 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM tris ( 2 - carboxyethel ) phosphine hydrochloride ) . The calorimetric titrations were carried out with 20 – 45 injections of 5 – 10 μ l TAK1 residues 479 – 579 ( 0 . 5 – 0 . 8 μ M ) , spaced 180 s apart , into the sample cell containing a solution of 1 . 334 ml TAB2 residues 574 – 693 ( 20 – 80 μ M ) . After subtracting the heat of dilution , the association constant ( K A ) , enthalpy change ( Δ H ) and the stoichiometry ( N ) were obtained by fitting the thermograms to a one - set binding site model using ORIGIN software . The remaining thermodynamic parameters , the dissociation constant ( K D ) , free energy change ( Δ G ) , and the entropy change ( Δ S ) were calculated from the relationships : K A − 1 = K D and - RT ln K A = Δ G = Δ H - T Δ S . Transfection and Retroviral Infection Transfection of HEK293 cells were performed using Calcium Phosphate Transfection kit ( Invitrogen ; Carlsbad , CA ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . For production of retroviral supernatants , GP2 - 293 cells were co - transfected with the indicated retroviral vector and pVSV - G ( Clontech ; Palo Alto , CA ) using Fugene 6 transfection reagent ( Boehringer Mannheim ; Indianapolis , IN ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . Twelve hours after transfection , the medium was replaced with fresh medium . Viral supernatants were collected after 48 – 72 hours and used to infect HEK293 , RAW264 . 7 , or L929 cells . After two days , selection was initiated with G418 ( 500 μ g / ml ) or puromycin ( 4 μ g / ml ) . Stable pools of cells or clones were maintained in G418 ( 300 μ g / ml ) or puromycin ( 2 μ g / ml ) . Reporter Gene Assays HEK293 cells were plated into 6 - wells plates and transfected as above together with an NF - κ B - driven luciferase reporter construct ( 0 . 5 μ g / well ) . The total amount of DNA was adjusted to 2 . 5 μ g / well with empty vector . Thirty - six hours after transfection , cells were harvested and lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity using Dual - Luciferase Reporter Assay System from Promega ( Madison , WI ) .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Protein Extraction , Immunoprecipitation , and Western Blotting Cells were harvested , washed two times with ice - cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and then lysed in buffer containing 20 mM TRIS , pH 7 . 4 , 250 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM sodium orthovanadate , 2 mM EDTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 2 mg / ml leupeptin , and 2 mg / ml aprotinin for 20 minutes on ice . Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 13K rpm for 15 minutes . Protein was estimated by using the BioRad Protein Assay dye . For immunoprecipitation , equivalent amounts of cell lysate were incubated with various antibodies for 2 hours at 4°C under rotation . Then 15 μ l of Protein A / G agarose beads were added and incubated for an additional hour at 4°C under rotation . The immune complex was washed 3 times with lysis buffer and one time with low - salt buffer ( 20 mM TRIS , pH 7 . 4 , 25 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT ) . For GST pull down assays , glutathione agarose beads coated with indicated GST fusion proteins were mixed with equivalent amounts of cell lysate for 2 hours at 4°C under rotation . The protein complexes were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and one time with low - salt buffer . For immunoblotting , the immunoprecipitates , GST pulled - down protein complexes , or cell lysates were resolved on SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane ( BioRad ; Hercules , CA ) . The membranes were immunoblotted with indicated antibodies followed by the appropriate secondary antibody and the visualized by using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence ( ECL ) Western Blotting system ( Amersham ; Piscataway , NJ ) . In Vitro Kinase Assays JNK and NEMO activities were analyzed using GST - Jun and GST - I κ B α as substrates as previously described ( 23 – 25 ) . Briefly , cells were plated in 6 - well or 10 cm plates and the next day they were starved overnight . The following day , cells were treated with the indicated cytokine and washed three times in ice - cold PBS . Cells were lysed for 20 min on ice in lysis buffer and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 13k rpm for 15 minutes . Equivalent amount of proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti - JNK1 or anti - NEMO antibodies as described above . The kinase assay was performed in a 2x reaction mix containing 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 20 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT , 2 . 5 μ g of GST - Jun or GST - I κ B α , and 10 μ Ci of [ γ - 32 P ] ATP at 30°C for 20 min . Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS - sample buffer and subjected to 10 % SDS - PAGE . Phosphorylation of GST - Jun or GST - I κ B α was detected using autoradiography . The incorporation of [ γ - 32 P ] ATP into the substrate was quantitated with a Phosphorimager using ImageQuant software ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) . Osteoclast Differentiation Stable RAW cell lines were plated in 24 - well plates at 1 × 10 4 cells / well in triplicate , and the next day treated with 100 ng / ml with RANKL . After 5 days , cells were fixed and stained for TRAP after which pictures were taken of representative fields . Osteoclast formation was assessed by counting the number of TRAP - positive multi - nucleated cells per well . In some cases prior to fixing the cells , pictures were taken with a 10× objective lens under bright or fluorescent light . RESULTS Binding of TAB2 Occurs in a Non - contiguous Region Within the C - terminal Tail of TAK1 While previous studies have shown that TAB2 could interact with the C - terminus of TAK1 , the precise domain in TAK1 that is required for TAB2 binding has not been mapped . To further map the region of TAK1 that is required to bind TAB2 , we took two alternative approaches . In the first approach , we created a series of C - terminal deletion mutants of FLAG - tagged TAK1 ( Fig . 1A ) and co - transfected full - length TAK1 ( TAK1 - FL ) or the Besse et al . Page 5 J Biol Chem . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2011 October 18 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t indicated TAK1 deletion mutants with FLAG - TAB2 in HEK293 cells . The cell lysates were either immunoprecipitated with anti - TAB2 and immunoblotted with anti - FLAG or immunoblotted with anti - FLAG . TAB2 co - precipitated with only TAK1 - FL , TAK1 - Δ 5 and TAK1 - Δ 6 ( Fig . 1B ) . Analysis of these TAK1 deletion mutants indicated that TAB2 appears to interact with residues 479 – 547 of TAK1 , since TAK1 - Δ 5 and TAK1 - Δ 6 both interacted with TAB2 , but not TAK1 - Δ 1 - Δ 4 or TAK1 - Δ 7 . In confirmation of these results , we performed GST - fusion pull down experiments with either GST or GST - TAB2 and lysates from transiently transfected HEK293 cells programmed to express various TAK1 deletion mutants . Similar to the co - immunoprecipitation experiments , only TAK1 - FL , TAK1 - Δ 5 , and TAK1 - Δ 6 interacted with GST - TAB2 ( Fig . 1C ) . These results demonstrate that the region of TAK1 comprised between the residues 479 – 547 interacts with TAB2 . In the alternative approach , we compared the primary amino acid sequence within the last 100 residues of TAK1 from multiple species and designed three internal TAK1 deletion mutants that lacked residues between 508 – 547 ( Fig . 1A ; Δ 8 – Δ 10 ) . We analyzed the ability of these TAK1 mutants to interact with co - transfected TAB2 in HEK293 cells . TAB2 co - precipitated with TAK1 - FL and TAK1 - Δ 8 , but weakly with TAK1 - Δ 9 and not at all with TAK1 - Δ 10 ( Fig . 1D ) . Similarly , GST - TAB2 also interacted with TAK1 - FL and TAK1 - Δ 8 , but weakly with TAK1 - Δ 9 and not at all with TAK1 - Δ 10 ( Fig . 1E ) , suggesting that residues 521 – 545 are not essential for the interaction but residues 509 – 520 are important . TAB3 , a Homologue of TAB2 , Binds to the Same Region of TAK1 TAB3 has recently been described as functional homologue of TAB2 ( 17 , 18 ) . To determine whether the TAB2 - binding region in TAK1 interacts also with TAB3 , we transiently transfected HEK293 cells with various TAK1 deletion mutants and examined their ability to precipitate with GST - TAB3 . Similar to TAB2 , GST - TAB3 interacted only with TAK1 - FL , TAK1 - Δ 6 , and TAK1 - Δ 8 ( Fig . 1F ) . Notably , TAK1 - Δ 9 interacted weakly with GST - TAB2 , but not at all with GST - TAB3 suggesting a slight variation in the binding motif . A GFP - fusion Protein Containing the C - terminal 100 Residues of TAK1 Binds Both TAB2 and TAB3 The data presented thus far indicate that residues 509 – 520 of TAK1 are important for binding both TAB2 and TAB3 . To determine whether this region is sufficient to interact with TAB2 / TAB3 , we created green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) fusion proteins containing residues 505 – 536 or 505 – 547 of TAK1 and examined their ability to bind TAB2 ; however , both of these constructs failed to interact with TAB2 and TAB3 ( data not shown ) . Since both TAB2 and TAB3 interacted with TAK1 - Δ 6 , which contains the C - terminal 100 residues of TAK1 , we generated additional GFP - fusion proteins consisting of residues 479 – 579 ( TAK1 - C100 ) , 479 – 520 ( TAK1 479 – 520 ) , 505 – 553 ( TAK1 505 – 553 ) , and 479 – 553 ( TAK1 470 – 553 ) of TAK1 ( Fig . 2A ) . The GFP - fusion protein containing TAK1 - C100 and TAK1 479 – 553 interacted with both TAB2 and TAB3 by co - immunoprecipitation and GST - fusion pull down experiments , while GFP - fusion proteins containing TAK1 479 – 520 or TAK1 505 – 553 failed to interact with TAB2 and TAB3 ( Fig . 2B – C ) . Collectively , these data indicate that the interaction of TAB2 / TAB3 with TAK1 resides in a non - contiguous region of TAK1 , and suggests that residues 509 – 520 of TAK1 are important for this interaction , but not sufficient for binding TAB2 and TAB3 ( see Discussion ) . The C - terminal 100 Residues of TAK1 Binds to Residues 574 – 693 of TAB2 Since we mapped a small region of TAK1 that is necessary for interaction with TAB2 / TAB3 , we also determined the region of TAB2 that interacts with TAK1 . We constructed a series of GST - fusion proteins containing the C - terminal region of TAB2 ( Fig . 2D ) and similar to previous experiments , we examined their ability to interact with TAK1 . HEK293 Besse et al . Page 6 J Biol Chem . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2011 October 18 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t cells were transfected with FLAG - tagged TAK1 and cell lysates were used in GST pull - down experiments . TAK1 interacted with TAB2 mutants containing residues 516 – 693 or 574 – 693 , but not with residues containing primarily the C - terminal Zn - finger domain of TAB2 ( 653 – 693 ) ( Fig . 2E ) . These data suggest that a region between residues 574 – 653 of TAB2 is necessary to interact with TAK1 . Consistent with these observations , mutation of the Zn - finger domain ( C670 / 673A ) of TAB2 did not prevent TAK1 from interacting with TAB2 ( data not shown ) . In confirmation of our findings , we examined quantitatively the interaction between recombinant proteins consisting of the C - termini of both TAK1 ( 479 – 579 ) and TAB2 ( 574 – 693 ) by isothermal titration calorimetry . Measurements from this experiment indicated a stiochiometric - binding ratio of 1 : 1 between TAK1 and TAB2 with a calculated K D of 65 μ M ( data not shown ) . Taken together , these results indicate that the C - terminal 100 residues of TAK1 are sufficient to interact with the C - terminus of TAB2 . TAK1 - C100 Significantly Impairs TAB2 - TAK1 Interaction and Inhibits TRAF6 - induced Activation of IKK We hypothesized that since TAB2 / TAB3 both interacted with the C - terminal 100 residues of TAK1 , expression of only the C - terminal tail of TAK1 may function as a dominant negative mutant and block subsequent TAK1 activation and downstream signaling . To explore this possibility , we created a retroviral vector expressing a GFP - fusion protein consisting of the C - terminal 100 residues of TAK1 ( TAK1 - C100 ) ( Fig . 2A ) . While a somewhat smaller region was sufficient to interact with TAB2 / TAB3 , we opted to use TAK1 - C100 to ensure correct folding and increase the ability to interact with both TAB2 and TAB3 . The activation of IKK by TRAF6 has been reported to involve the K63 - linked auto - ubiquitination of TRAF6 , which serves as a scaffold to recruit TAB2 by its ability to selectively bind K63 - linked poly - ubiquitin chains ( 12 , 21 , 30 , 31 ) ( B . G . D . , unpublished observations ) . The formation of a TRAF6 - TAB2 - TAK1 complex may cause conformational changes in the catalytic domain of TAK1 thereby inducing its kinase activity . HEK293 cells stably expressing TRAF6 or empty vector ( pMX ) were infected with retrovirus expressing either GFP or TAK1 - C100 and selected with neomycin for two weeks . After selection , the cells were harvested and lysates were examined for the interaction between TAB2 and TAK1 by immunoprecipitation with anti - TAB2 and immunoblotting with anti - TAK1 . The interaction between TAB2 - TAK1 complex was significantly impaired in cells expressing TAK1 - C100 compared to the cells expressing only GFP ( Fig . 2F ) . We observed equivalent expression of all of the exogenous proteins as well as TAB1 indicating that the loss of the TAB2 - TAK1 complex was not due to downregulation of any of these proteins ( Fig . 2F ) . Furthermore , expression of TRAF6 caused activation of IKK as judged by immunoblotting with anti - phospho I κ B α , which was significantly reduced in TRAF6 - expressing cells that also expressed TAK1 - C100 ( Fig . 2F ) . These data reveal the essential requirement of the TAB2 - TAK1 interaction for TAK1 - dependent activation of the NF - κ B pathway . TAK1 - C100 Blocks NF - κ B Activation by RANK , TRAF6 , and TAB2 Since TAK1 lies downstream of both RANK and TAB2 , we next determined whether TAK1 - C100 , through its ability to sequester both TAB2 / TAB3 could inhibit NF - κ B activation induced by RANK and TAB2 . HEK293 cells were transiently co - transfected with RANK and TAB2 in combination with GFP or TAK1 - C100 together with a NF - κ B luciferase reporter vector . While expression of GFP had no effect , TAK1 - C100 significantly inhibited RANK - and TAB2 - induced NF - κ B activation ( Fig . 3A ) . Furthermore , we generated HEK293 cells stably expressing either GFP or TAK1 - C100 and then examined the ability of RANK , TRAF6 , and TAB2 to activate an NF - κ B luciferase reporter in these cell lines . As previously observed , the RANK - , TRAF6 - , and TAB2 - induced NF - κ B activation was significantly impaired in cells expressing TAK1 - C100 compared to GFP Besse et al . Page 7 J Biol Chem .

Taken together , these results demonstrate that the interaction between TAB2 / TAB3 and TAK1 is critical for TAK1 activation and subsequent NF - κ B activation . TAK1 - C100 Inhibits Signaling by IL - 1 and TNF The essential role of TAK1 in activation of NF - κ B by IL - 1 and TNF has been reported in embryonic fibroblasts lacking TAK1 ( 32 , 33 ) . To determine whether TAK1 - C100 inhibits IL - 1 and TNF signaling , we generated L929 ( mouse fibroblast ) cell lines stably expressing either GFP or TAK1 - C100 . Non - infected L929 cells were used as autofluorescence staining control ( Fig . 4A ) . Next , serum - starved cells were stimulated with either IL - 1 or TNF for the indicated times and cell lysates prepared . Stable expression of TAK1 - C100 , but not GFP , inhibited both IL - 1 - and TNF - induced phosphorylation of I κ B α , c - Jun , and p38 ( Fig . 4B ) , which suggests that TAK1 - C100 function as a dominant negative inhibitor by blocking the interaction between TAB2 / TAB3 and TAK1 . To further confirm this hypothesis , we stimulated the two different cell lines with IL - 1 and examined whether TAK1 was present in the TAB2 complex by immunoprecipitating with anti - TAB2 antibody . After IL - 1 stimulation , L929 cells expressing GFP showed increased amounts of TAK1 co - precipitating with TAB2 , but TAK1 was absent in the anti - TAB2 complex from cells expressing TAK1 - C100 ( Fig . 4C ) , although equivalent amounts of TAB2 were immunoprecipitated . Furthermore , using a phospho - specific antibody directed against the active form of TAK1 ( 15 , 34 ) , the phosphorylation of TAK1 induced by IL - 1 stimulation was also inhibited in cells expressing TAK1 - C100 ( Fig . 4C ) . These data reveal an essential role of the TAB2 - TAK1 complex for both IL - 1 and TNF signaling . TAK1 is Required for RANKL - induced Osteoclast Differentiation From the data presented above , TAK1 - C100 blocked NF - κ B activation induced by RANK and its essential modulator TRAF6 ( Fig . 3 ) , which suggests that TAK1 may function in the RANKL - RANK pathway . As a prelude to investigating the TAB2 - TAK1 complex in the RANK pathway , we first sought to determine whether TAK1 is required for osteoclast differentiation in vitro . The mouse macrophage cell line RAW264 . 7 ( RAW ) was infected with a control retrovirus ( pMX ) or expressing either FLAG - tagged TAK1 ( TAK1 - WT ) or a catalytically inactive mutant of TAK1 ( TAK1 - K63W ) followed by selection with puromycin . After selection , cells were examined for their ability to differentiate into TRAP - positive osteoclast following RANKL treatment for 5 days . Results from this experiment revealed that only control cells or cells expressing TAK1 - WT have the ability to form osteoclasts , while cells expressing TAK1 - K63W failed to form osteoclasts ( Fig . 5A – B ) . These data demonstrate that the kinase activity of TAK1 is crucial for in vitro RANKL - stimulated osteoclast differentiation . Catalytically Inactive TAK1 Inhibits RANKL - induced IKK and JNK Activation Loss of osteoclast differentiation by RANKL in cells expressing TAK1 - K63W may reflect the absence of IKK and / or JNK activation by RANKL . To test this hypothesis , we examined the activation of IKK and JNK after RANKL stimulation in RAW cells stably expressing empty vector , TAK1 - WT , or TAK1 - K63W . The RANKL - mediated activation of both IKK and JNK was significantly reduced in cells expressing TAK1 - K63W as compared to either cells expressing empty vector or TAK1 - WT ( Fig . 5C ) . These data demonstrate that TAK1 - K63W functions as a dominant negative regulator of RANKL - mediated osteoclast differentiation most likely by blocking both IKK and JNK activation . TAK1 - C100 Inhibits RANKL - mediated Osteoclast Differentiation and Signaling The data presented thus far have demonstrated that the interaction between TAB2 and TAK1 is essential for activation of NF - κ B and MAPK induced by IL - 1 and TNF or by transient Besse et al .

We next addressed whether the interaction of TAK1 with TAB2 is required for RANKL - mediated signaling and osteoclast differentiation . We generated RAW cells stably expressing GFP or TAK1 - C100 and selected individual clones expressing each protein for further analysis . First , we examined RANKL - mediated osteoclast differentiation in these clones expressing either GFP or TAK1 - C100 . Expression of TAK1 - C100 , but not GFP alone , prevented RANKL - dependent osteoclast differentiation as visualized by TRAP - positive staining ( Fig . 6A ) . As shown graphically , TAK1 - C100 significantly reduced the number of TRAP - positive osteoclasts induced by RANKL ( Fig . 6B ) . These results demonstrate that the interaction between TAB2 and TAK1 is necessary for RANKL - induced osteoclast differentiation . We next examined the activation of IKK and JNK upon RANKL stimulation in RAW cells expressing GFP or TAK1 - C100 . The RANKL - induced activation of both JNK and IKK was notably impaired in cells expressing TAK1 - C100 as compared to cells expressing only GFP ( Fig . 6C ) . Furthermore , the transcription factor NFATc1 plays an important role in terminal differentiation of osteoclast progenitors ( 35 – 39 ) . We examined for expression of NFATc1 in nuclear extracts following RANKL stimulation for zero , 12 , 24 , and 48 hours in cells expressing either GFP or TAK1 - C100 . RAW cells expressing GFP exhibited nuclear accumulation of NFATc1 after RANKL stimulation , which was completely abolished in cells expressing TAK1 - C100 ( Fig . 6D ) . Taken together these results demonstrate that the interaction between TAB2 / TAB3 and TAK1 is required to obtain full activation of TAK1 , which in turn activates both the IKK complex and MAPKs pathways . Moreover , interfering with the interaction between TAB2 and TAK1 also results in the loss of induction of NFATc1 by RANKL . DISCUSSION In the IL - 1 and TNF pathways , genetic ablation of TAK1 in mice has implicated this MAP3K in the activation of IKK and JNK , which results in the induction of NF - κ B and AP1 transcription factors , respectively ( 32 , 33 ) . However , IL - 1 and TNF activate these pathways in the absence of either TAB1 or TAB2 ; the later of which is likely compensated its homologue TAB3 . The functional role of TAB1 in this process remains unclear at present . Previous studies have demonstrated that TRAF6 interacts with TAB2 in an IL - 1 - dependent manner , resulting in the formation of a TRAF6 - TAB2 - TAK1 complex that is required for activation of NF - κ B and JNK ( 15 ) . In this model , TAB2 acts as a bridge linking TRAF6 to TAK1 and thereby mediating the activation of TAK1 in the IL - 1 pathway . Similarly , since TRAF6 is essential for RANKL - mediated signaling ( 11 , 40 – 44 ) , engagement of the RANK pathway may use the identical TRAF6 - TAB2 - TAK1 complex for its signaling leading to osteoclast differentiation . In contrast , stimulation by TNF causes the site - specific K63 ubiquitination of RIP1 in the TNFR1 complex by an unidentified E3 ligase ( possibly TRAF2 or cIAP1 ) , which serves to recruit TAB2 and NEMO resulting in the receptor recruitment of the TAK1 ( through the NZF ubiquitin binding domain of TAB2 / 3 ) and IKK complexes ( 45 ) . While this model demonstrates an essential requirement of TAK1 in activating these signaling cascades , the functional interaction between TAB2 / TAB3 and TAK1 remains elusive due to a suitable cell system lacking both TAB2 and TAB3 . We hypothesized that disruption of the constitutive interaction between TAB2 / TAB3 may interfere with TAK1 activation since previous data indicated that silencing both TAB2 and TAB3 by siRNA knockdown abolished IL - 1 and TNF signaling ( 19 ) . We sought an alternative strategy “to neutralize” both TAB2 and TAB3 by developing a construct that could interact with both TAB2 / TAB3 and block their interaction with TAK1 . To test our hypothesis , we first characterized the region of TAK1 that is necessary to interact with TAB2 and TAB3 . Through deletion mapping , co - immunoprecipitation , and GST pull - down Besse et al . Page 9 J Biol Chem . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2011 October 18 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t experiments , we demonstrated that residues 509 – 520 of TAK1 appear to be important for binding both TAB2 and TAB3 , but not sufficient . However , a larger region encompassing residues 479 – 553 of TAK1 was sufficient for interacting with TAB2 and TAB3 . Further analysis utilizing programs to predict secondary structure ( 46 ) of the C - terminal 100 residues of TAK1 indicated an alpha - helical structure ( Fig . 7 ) . In brief , the last 100 residues of TAK1 are predicted to form four alpha helices ( Helix 1 , 490 – 505 ; Helix 2 , 512 – 526 ; Helix 3 , 536 – 549 ; Helix 4 , 553 – 573 ) . Since TAK1 - Δ 5 , which terminated with residue 547 , and GFP - TAK1 479 – 553 interacted with TAB2 / TAB3 , Helix 4 probably does not contribute to this interaction as summarized in Fig . 7 . We also generated GFP - fusion constructs encompassing Helix 1 and part of Helix 2 ( TAK1 479 – 520 ) , Helix 2 ( TAK1 505 – 536 ) , both Helix 2 and 3 ( TAK1 505 – 547 and 505 – 553 ) , or Helix 1 , 2 , and 3 ( TAK1 479 – 553 ) , but all of these constructs except TAK1 479 – 553 failed to interact with TAB2 / TAB3 . These results suggest that the C - terminal 100 residues of TAK1 , with the exception of Helix 4 , forms a tertiary conformation and that eliminating any one or more of these predicted helices may interfere with the intermolecular contacts required for the proper folding of this domain . Nonetheless , the C - terminal region of TAK1 appears as a functional domain that is required for interacting with TAB2 / TAB3 . Since TAK1 - C100 was able to bind both TAB2 and TAB3 , we next investigated whether this region could functionally block the interaction of endogenous TAB2 / TAB3 and TAK1 . Using a retroviral delivery system , we presented evidence that a GFP fusion protein consisting of TAK1 - C100 was able to significantly impair the constitutive interaction of TAB2 / TAB3 with TAK1 . Furthermore , using L929 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing TAK1 - C100 we clearly demonstrated that interfering with the TAB2 / TAB3 - TAK1 interaction blocked NF - κ B and MAPKs signaling upon IL - 1 and TNF stimulation through the inhibition of TAK1 phosphorylation . Moreover , expression of TAK1 - C100 in HEK293 cells abolished the ability of RANK , TRAF6 , and TAB2 to activate an NF - κ B luciferase reporter . Collectively , these data support a critical role of the interaction of either TAB2 or TAB3 with TAK1 for its activation and therefore its ability to stimulate the IKK and JNK pathways in response to IL - 1 and TNF stimulation . Analogous to the IL - 1 signal transduction pathway , RANKL requires engagement of the TRAF6 machinery for its signaling since TRAF6 - deficiency results in complete loss of RANKL signaling and osteoclast differentiation ( 11 , 40 ) . Notably , the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF6 and its auto - ubiquitination are essential for NF - κ B and JNK activation in osteoclast progenitors ( B . L . and B . G . D . , unpublished observations ) . Ectopic expression of a catalytically inactive TAK1 abolished RANKL - mediated IKK and JNK activation and consequently the differentiation of these cells into TRAP - positive osteoclasts , suggesting an essential role of TAK1 in this process . In support of this hypothesis , RAW cells stably expressing TAK1 - C100 showed dramatic loss of RANKL - mediated IKK and JNK activation and osteoclast differentiation . Furthermore , the nuclear accumulation of NFATc1 , a critical transcription factor for osteoclast differentiation , was considerably reduced in TAK1 - C100 expressing RAW cells . These results place TAK1 as a potential upstream activator of NFATc1 in the formation of multi - nucleated osteoclasts . In summary , we have demonstrated in this study the fundamental role of TAB2 / TAB3 as key adaptors between different receptor complexes and a central kinase , TAK1 , involved in multiple pathways . By identifying a region of TAK1 that is necessary for interacting with TAB2 / TAB3 , we were able to develop a model system to explore the functional requirement of this interaction in signaling by IL - 1 , TNF , and RANKL . Indeed , TAB2 - deficient MEFs showed normal activation of downstream signaling pathways upon IL - 1 and TNF stimulation , suggesting that the TAB2 homologue TAB3 compensates for the absence of Besse et al .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t TAB2 ( data not shown ) . Nevertheless , in the current proposed model ( 47 ) , blocking TAB2 - TAK1 and TAB3 - TAK1 interactions would likely prevent the recruitment of TAK1 to the TRAF6 and TRAF2 complexes and consequently TAK1 activation . Further investigation will be necessary to understand the role of TAB2 / TAB3 in TAK1 - dependent signaling possibly by generation of conditional knockout mice deficient in both TAB2 and TAB3 .
