The two adjectives most commonly used to define cal - cium signalling are universal and versatile 1 . The uni - versality of calcium ions ( Ca 2 + ) as signalling molecules derives from their ubiquity as intracellular second mes - sengers that control a wide range of critical processes , whereas the versatility of Ca 2 + depends on its ability to generate signals with largely different spatial and temporal forms 2 ( Box 1 ) . Among the many organelles , mitochondria have major roles as both regulators and decoders of Ca 2 + inputs . Owing to their intrinsically dynamic nature , mitochondria can localize at specific positions throughout the cell , thereby shaping the cellular Ca 2 + response . Mitochondria also act as Ca 2 + - dependent effectors of a vast range of processes , such as energy production and cell death ( Box 2 ) . As described by Ernesto Carafoli in a fascinating historical review 3 , the first indirect evidence of Ca 2 + transport inside mitochondria dates back to 1953 ( ref . 4 ) , but the concept that isolated mitochondria can take up high levels of Ca 2 + by using ATP - derived energy emerged only in the 1960s , with observations made by two independent groups 5 , 6 . Since then , mitochondria have been thought of as well - defined structures capable of accumulating large amounts of Ca 2 + ions inside their matrix . Over the past 60 years , intense research in the Ca 2 + field has defined the basic features of mitochon - drial Ca 2 + handling and has clearly established the role of mitochondria in the regulation of cellular Ca 2 + homeo - stasis , as well as specific functions of mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake . Under resting conditions , the Ca 2 + con - centration ( [ Ca 2 + ] ) inside mitochondria approaches the values measured in the bulk cytoplasm ( 100 – 200 nM ) , but during stimulation with [ Ca 2 + ] - increasing agents , mitochondria accumulate 10 - to 20 - fold more Ca 2 + than the cytosolic compartment . The sources of Ca 2 + required for such [ Ca 2 + ] rises are external ( the prevail - ing mechanism in neurons and other excitable cells ) , whereby Ca 2 + is taken up from the extracellular milieu ( [ Ca 2 + ] of ~ 1 mM ) by plasma membrane channels , such as transient receptor potential channels ( TRPCs ) and Ca 2 + release - activated Ca 2 + ( CRAC ) channel protein 1 ( ORAI1 ) , or internal , resulting from the release of Ca 2 + from internal sources — endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) or sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) in muscle cells , the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes — via different classes of intra - cellular channel , such as the inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) receptors ( Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 Rs ) , ryanodine receptors ( RyRs ) and TRPC mucolipin 1 ( TRPML1 ) . These intracellular Ca 2 + stores are loaded with Ca 2 + ( [ Ca 2 + ] > 300 µM ) at the expense of ATP hydrolysis via the activity of Ca 2 + pumps ( sarcoplasmic / endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + ATPases ( SERCAs ) and the secretory pathway Ca 2 + - ATPases ( SPCAs ) ) . The reduction of ER intraluminal Ca 2 + results in a massive influx of Ca 2 + from the extracellular space through the CRAC channels , a mechanism known as capacitative Ca 2 + influx or store - operated Ca 2 + entry ( SOCE ) , to provide Ca 2 + for refill - ing the ER and to regulate a large number of signalling functions by increasing cytosolic [ Ca 2 + ] 7 ( Box 1 ; fig . 1 ) .

The machineries , regulation and cellular functions of mitochondrial calcium Carlotta Giorgi 1 , 3 , Saverio Marchi 1 , 3 and Paolo Pinton 1 , 2 * Abstract | Calcium ions ( Ca 2 + ) are some of the most versatile signalling molecules , and they have many physiological functions , prominently including muscle contraction , neuronal excitability , cell migration and cell growth . By sequestering and releasing Ca 2 + , mitochondria serve as important regulators of cellular Ca 2 + . Mitochondrial Ca 2 + also has other important functions , such as regulation of mitochondrial metabolism , ATP production and cell death . In recent years , identification of the molecular machinery regulating mitochondrial Ca 2 + accumulation and efflux has expanded the number of ( patho ) physiological conditions that rely on mitochondrial Ca 2 + homeostasis . Thus , expanding the understanding of the mechanisms of mitochondrial Ca 2 + regulation and function in different cell types is an important task in biomedical research , which offers the possibility of targeting mitochondrial Ca 2 + machinery for the treatment of several disorders . 1 Department of Morphology , Surgery and Experimental Medicine , Section of Pathology , Oncology and Experimental Biology , Laboratory for Technologies of Advanced Therapies ( LTTA ) , University of Ferrara , Ferrara , Italy . 2 Maria Cecilia Hospital , GVM Care and Research , Cotignola , Ravenna , Italy . 3 These authors contributed equally : Carlotta Giorgi , Saverio Marchi . * e - mail : paolo . pinton @ unife . it https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41580 - 018 - 0052 - 8 Corrected : Publisher Correction nATure revIeWS | MoleCulAR Cell BIology R e v i e w s volume 19 | november 2018 | 713 Ca 2 + - selective channel located at the inner mitochon - drial membrane ( IMM ) explain how large amounts of Ca 2 + could enter these organelles . Ca 2 + uptake is driven by a membrane potential difference ( ΔΨ ) generated by the respiratory chain , which provides the electrochem - ical force required for positively charged ions to enter the matrix . However , Ca 2 + does not remain inside mito - chondria but instead is rapidly extruded into the cyto - plasm through a complex system of Ca 2 + antiporters , restoring the basal state . Thus , the coordination of this highly sophisticated Ca 2 + machinery , which consists of different pumps , channels and auxiliary proteins , is cru - cial for the maintenance of mitochondrial Ca 2 + homeo - stasis , which in turn further demonstrates the impact of the mitochondrial compartment in the regulation of cellular Ca 2 + signalling . In this Review , we describe the molecular details of the different Ca 2 + transporters and provide mechanistic insight into the related regulatory pathways of mito - chondrial Ca 2 + uptake and efflux , discussing the most recent discoveries and the many unanswered questions and conflicting interpretations regarding mechanisms of Ca 2 + homeostasis . We also outline the physiological role of mitochondrial Ca 2 + and its deregulation in several pathological contexts . Mitochondrial Ca 2 + entry The continuous development of methods for measur - ing [ Ca 2 + ] , based on either luminescent or fluorescent probes ( Box 3 ) , has enabled the characterization of intrin - sic mechanisms regulating mitochondrial Ca 2 + handling . To reach the mitochondrial matrix , cytosolic Ca 2 + has to Box 1 | Ca 2 + as a second messenger Calcium ions ( Ca 2 + ) are ubiquitous second messengers that translate information delivered by extracellular and intracellular signals into an intracellular effect . A rise in cytoplasmic Ca 2 + concentration ( [ Ca 2 + ] c ) is elicited by a wide variety of molecules and decoded into very different , sometimes opposite , effects . To fulfil such a complex signalling role , [ Ca 2 + ] c rises are spatially and temporally regulated ( see the figure ) . The localized rises can remain confined , thereby preventing the inappropriate stimulation of different cellular domains , or gradually diffuse , as in the case of Ca 2 + waves — orderly propagations of [ Ca 2 + ] c rises throughout the cell . Agonists of G protein - coupled receptors , such as histamine , ATP or carbachol , can induce , in many cell types , a series of repetitive [ Ca 2 + ] c increases , commonly referred to as Ca 2 + oscillations . Each of these signalling patterns , through the specific recruitment of downstream effectors , is decoded into the appropriate cellular effect . various mammalian proteins are regulated by Ca 2 + , and these are classified as buffer or trigger proteins 216 . Ca 2 + buffers encompass calsequestrin and calreticulin , which are located at the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , respectively , and the cytosolic proteins calbindin and calretinin , as well as the relatively slow buffer parvalbumin . This class of molecules not only cooperates with Ca 2 + channels , transporters and pumps to shape intracellular Ca 2 + signals but also displays multiple functions and physiological roles 217 . Trigger proteins include modulators of muscle contraction ( troponin C , slow skeletal and cardiac muscles ( Tn - C ) ) , proteases ( calpain ) , kinases ( protein kinase C ( PKC ) ) phosphatases ( calcineurin B ) , transcription factors ( members of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) and cAMP - responsive element - binding protein ( Creb ) families ) and key mediators of various enzymes ( calmodulin ) . most of these possess one or multiple EF - hand Ca 2 + - binding motifs and change their conformation upon binding Ca 2 + . overall , Ca 2 + binding can affect the localization , molecular associations and functions of a multitude of proteins , regulating a vast array of biological processes , such as contraction , transcription and other signalling networks . The functions of Ca 2 + in coordinating different cellular events are not limited to variations in its cytosolic levels but can be extended to changes in Ca 2 + inside organelles . For example , lysosomal Ca 2 + activates calcineurin , which in turn promotes transcription factor EB ( TFEB ) translocation into the nucleus and transactivation of its target genes 132 . As another example , after fertilization , mitochondrial Ca 2 + entry sustains production of reactive oxygen species and cell cycle progression in early Xenopus laevis embryos 218 .

Mitochondrial Ca 2 + channels . The first barrier , the OMM , is considered highly permeable to Ca 2 + ions , and this permeability is ensured by high expression of the voltage - dependent anion - selective channel proteins ( VDACs ) , which form pores in the OMM and represent the first molecular interface between mitochondria and Ca 2 + stores ( the ER and / or SR and the extracellular space ) . VDACs exist as three subtypes ( VDAC1 , VDAC2 and VDAC3 ) , which are expressed more or less ubiquitously but vary in their isoform ratios and sub - mitochondrial distribution among tissues 8 , 9 and mediate the flux of ions , nucleotides ( ADP and / or ATP ) and other metabolites . VDACs can assume multiple structural conformations , and the transition between open ( diameter of the chan - nel pore : 2 . 5 nm ) and closed ( pore size : 0 . 9 nm ) states occurs in a voltage - dependent manner . Low transmem - brane potentials determine a high - conductance , anion - selective state , whereas increased voltages ( 20 – 40 mV ) promote lower conducting conformations , which are assumed to be impermeable to nucleotides but still allow the flow of small cations , including Ca 2 + ( refs 10 , 11 ) . Notably , closed conformations of VDACs show higher selectivity and efficiency of Ca 2 + transport 12 , but the posi - tive charge does not exclude Ca 2 + from the open state , as the anion selectivity of VDACs is not very high . Of note , it has been proposed that the potential across the IMM might influence the OMM pores , suggesting that VDACs located at the mitochondrial membrane contact sites might assume a closed state , whereas VDACs positioned beyond the contacts should stay in the high - conducting open conformation 13 . Overall , VDACs mediate Ca 2 + flux in both open and closed conformation , thereby limiting the generation of any [ Ca 2 + ] gradient across the OMM . Recent findings have highlighted the key role of VDACs in enhancing the Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P3 - induced Ca 2 + signal from the ER in different contexts 14 , 15 , facilitating Ca 2 + entry into the intermembrane space ( IMS ) and its accumu - lation inside the matrix ( fig . 2a ) . However , other uni - dentified pathways might be involved in the control of Ca 2 + permeation across the OMM , as the depletion of all VDAC isoforms does not affect the sensitivity of mitochondria to Ca 2 + - driven cell death 16 . After reaching the IMS , Ca 2 + ions pass the IMM mainly through the mitochondrial Ca 2 + uniporter ( MCU ) complex . However , MCU - independent , Ca 2 + uptake mechanisms have been reported , including an IMM - located pool of RyRs 17 , the canonical short tran - sient receptor potential channel 3 ( TRPC3 ) 18 , mitochon - drial uncoupling protein 2 ( UCP2 ) , UCP3 19 and leucine zipper EF - hand - containing transmembrane protein 1 ( LETM1 ) 20 . Nevertheless , the MCU unequivocally represents the dominant mechanism that allows Ca 2 + accumulation inside the mitochondrial matrix . It is now firmly established that the uniporter exists in a macro molecular complex , which apart from pore - form - ing subunits comprises several regulatory proteins 21 – 23 ( fig . 2b ) . Molecular characterization of the complex was made possible by studies that simultaneously identified MCU protein ( previously known as CCDC109a ) as the bona fide channel - forming component 24 , 25 . The other elements of the holocomplex are the MCU regulator MCUb ( also known as CCDC109b ) 26 and the IMS - resident protein mitochondrial calcium uptake protein 1 ( MICU1 ) ( ref . 27 ) , which binds to its paralogue MICU2 ( ref . 28 ) to form a heterodimeric structure 29 , 30 , which is associated with MCU through essential MCU regulator , EMRE ( also known as SMDT1 ) 31 . Additional compo - nents of the complex have been described , including Caspase An endoprotease involved in cell death and inflammation that contains catalytic cysteine residues in its active site that hydrolyse substrate peptides after specific aspartic acid residues . Box 2 | Mitochondrial Ca 2 + in cell death and cancer There is no doubt that cell death belongs to the numerous cell functions in which Ca 2 + exerts a complex regulatory role . It has long been known that in neurons and other cell types an uncontrolled increase in cytoplasmic Ca 2 + concentration ( [ Ca 2 + ] c ) can trigger apoptosis 219 – 221 , and likewise , agents that are able to release Ca 2 + from intracellular stores have been shown to be pro - apoptotic 222 . mitochondria have emerged as a critical site for the action of the apoptotic Ca 2 + signal . Whereas transient mitochondrial Ca 2 + oscillations stimulate metabolism and constitute a pro - survival signal , prolonged mitochondrial Ca 2 + overload is a fundamental trigger to initiate apoptosis through the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore ( mPTP ) 138 , 140 . Indeed , treatment with apoptotic stimuli causes a release of Ca 2 + from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and induces dramatic changes in mitochondrial morphology and in the release of caspase cofactors , leading to caspase activation . If Ca 2 + changes are prevented , mitochondrial morphology is preserved , and the cells are protected from apoptosis 140 . The mitochondrial Ca 2 + machinery thus represents a key decoding station for cell fate decisions . Several proto - oncogenes and tumour suppressors critically control these decisions by modulating mitochondrial Ca 2 + dynamics . By either controlling Ca 2 + signals arising from the er ( as is the case for promyelocytic leukaemia protein ( Pml ) , PTen , p53 and AKT , for example ) or directly modifying the activity of mitochondrial proteins involved in Ca 2 + influx and efflux ( as is observed , for example , for fragile histidine triad protein ( FHIT ) , signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) and tumour suppressor candidate 2 ( TUSC2 , also known as FUS1 ) ) , these proteins are able to modulate anti - apoptotic or pro - apoptotic signals , preventing or facilitating mitochondrial Ca 2 + overload and consequently cell death ( reviewed in ref . 140 ) . In response to different stress signals , tumour suppressors and proto - oncogenes can act at the er by modulating Ca 2 + store content and / or Ca 2 + dynamics ( including Ca 2 + leakage , Ca 2 + uptake and Ca 2 + release ) 223 and at mitochondria by affecting the expression levels of the components of the mitochondrial Ca 2 + uniporter ( mCu ) complex or the expression of leucine zipper EF - hand - containing transmembrane protein 1 ( leTm1 ) , which can drive mCu - independent Ca 2 + uptake , thereby regulating mitochondrial Ca 2 + levels 224 , 225 . mitochondrial Ca 2 + levels can also regulate the metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis ( Warburg effect ) that generally occurs in cancer cells and fuels their proliferation . More specifically , lowering the levels of mitochondrial Ca 2 + stimulates the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase , which is inhibited by Ca 2 + , thereby inducing the phosphorylation , and hence inactivation , of pyruvate dehydrogenase . In consequence , pyruvate is utilized for the production of lactate , instead of acetyl - CoA , which would be channelled to the Krebs cycle . notably , recent evidence has shown that both glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism are essential for cancer cell proliferation 226 . In addition , higher mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake capacity and generation of reactive oxygen species have been recognized as features of metastatic cells , and they promote cell migration and invasiveness but at the same time increase the vulnerability of cancer cells to Ca 2 + - mediated apoptosis . overall , it has become evident that the loss of mitochondrial Ca 2 + homeostasis is a hallmark of tumorigenesis and that it can favour the survival and augment the proliferative and migratory activity of cancer cells . restoring proper mitochondrial Ca 2 + signalling could therefore be a promising avenue for cancer treatment . For example , by modulating mitochondrial Ca 2 + , cancer cells could be re - sensitized to pro - apoptotic signalling . Indeed , many chemotherapeutic agents , as well as photodynamic therapy 227 , 228 , exert their cytotoxic effects via Ca 2 + signalling at er – mitochondria contact sites , and therefore , their actions are completely abolished in cancer cells with altered Ca 2 + kinetics and could be improved by combinatorial treatment with drugs targeting mitochondrial Ca 2 + transport machinery . nATure revIeWS | MoleCulAR Cell BIology R e v i e w s volume 19 | november 2018 | 715 MICU3 ( ref . 28 ) and MICU1 . 1 , a MICU1 splicing variant with higher Ca 2 + - binding affinity than MICU1 ( ref . 32 ) , which are tissue - specific members of the uniporter and are expressed in the central nervous system and skeletal muscle , respectively . The working model of the uniporter holocom - plex is the result of extensive research . After pass - ing the OMM , the incoming Ca 2 + is first handled by MICU1 – MICU2 dimers owing to their strategic IMS localization and the presence of two Ca 2 + - binding EF - hand domains in both MICU1 and MICU2 . Loss - of - function studies have definitively demonstrated that MICU1 – MICU2 dimers act as gatekeepers of the uniporter , setting the [ Ca 2 + ] threshold for MCU acti - vation and allowing mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake exclu - sively at a high [ Ca 2 + ] , thereby limiting the detrimental accumulation of Ca 2 + inside the matrix under basal ( unstimulated ) conditions 33 – 35 . Dissecting the intrinsic role of both MICU1 and MICU2 is complicated by the observations that MICU2 and MCU protein expression could be affected by the loss of MICU1 or vice versa and that MICU2 is unable to associate with MCU protein in a MICU1 - knockout background . One model proposes that MICU1 is a pure stimulatory subunit and identifies the dominant gatekeeping mechanism in MICU2 ( refs 29 , 30 ) . However , recent findings have provided new insights into the MICU regulatory mechanism , showing that at low cytosolic [ Ca 2 + ] ( < 500 nM ) , MICU1 alone is sufficient to repress MCU activity and requires MICU2 only when the external [ Ca 2 + ] is between 500 nM and 1 . 5 μM 36 , 37 . Thus , in MICU2 - knockout cells , the Ca 2 + threshold for MCU activation is ~ 500 nM , which is threefold lower than in the presence of MICU2 . Importantly , when the [ Ca 2 + ] rises , MICU1 cooperates with MCU to favour extensive Ca 2 + entry 33 , 38 , whereas MICU2 limits the MICU1 - mediated gain of uniporter function 36 , suggest - ing that MICU2 represents an additional layer of control for MCU activation . Although initial nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) studies of a truncated version of Caenorhabditis elegans MCU protein proposed a pentameric stoichiometry 39 , very recent observations showed that MCU assem - bles into tetrameric structures that form a channel 40 – 43 . The activity of this channel is strictly dependent on EMRE as mammalian MCU does not transport Ca 2 + in an EMRE - knockout background 31 . Although it was originally proposed that EMRE might control MCU by sensing the [ Ca 2 + ] in the matrix through its carboxy - terminal domain 44 , subsequent , and in our opinion more convincing , observations have revealed that the carboxyl terminus of EMRE is located in the IMS rather than in the matrix 45 , 46 , where it connects the MICU1 – MICU2 sensors to MCU , thereby regulating Ca 2 + entry 46 . MCU channel has been shown to be negatively regulated by MCU protein paralogue MCUb 26 , although over - expression of MCUb in Trypanosoma cruzi did not have a dominant - negative effect on MCU 47 , suggesting that in lower organisms , MCUb might have a complementary role to MCU protein . The characterization of the function of the MCU complex fulfils all the properties that were attributed to the uniporter several years before its molecular dis - covery , such as sensitivity to inhibition by ruthenium red , high Ca 2 + selectivity 48 , induction of Ca 2 + uptake only in energized mitochondria and low Ca 2 + affinity ( the appar - ent dissociation constant ( K d ) of MCU is 20 – 30 μM ) 49 , implying that the function of the MCU complex relies completely on two main parameters : the mitochon - drial membrane potential and the [ Ca 2 + ] in the area surrounding the channel . Mitochondrial membrane potential as a driving force for Ca 2 + uptake . After the wide acceptance of the chemiosmotic theory , it was postulated that the driv - ing force for Ca 2 + entry into the mitochondria is the proton electrochemical gradient potential generated by the activity of the respiratory electron transport chain . The reductive transfer of electrons through respira - tory complexes I – IV produces the energy required to pump H + ions against their concentration gradient in the IMS , resulting in a ΔΨ of 150 – 180 mV ( negative inside , thus favouring cation entrance ) ( fig . 2c ) .

The endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) ( sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells ) is the major intracellular Ca 2 + storage organelle . The sarcoplasmic / endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + ATPases ( SERCAs ) actively pump Ca 2 + into the store . The dynamic release of Ca 2 + from the ER is mediated by ryanodine receptors ( RyRs ) and inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate receptors ( Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 Rs ) . Ca 2 + released from the ER is captured by nearby mitochondria located in close contact with the ER through voltage - dependent anion - selective channel proteins ( VDACs ) and the mitochondrial Ca 2 + uniporter ( MCU ) complex , activating cellular metabolism . Depletion of the ER Ca 2 + stores results in the activation of Ca 2 + sensor protein stromal interaction molecule 1 ( STIM1 ) at the junctions between the ER and the plasma membrane , where it binds to and activates the Ca 2 + channel protein Ca 2 + release - activated Ca 2 + channel protein 1 ( ORAI1 ) ( which functions as a Ca 2 + release - activated Ca 2 + channel ( CRAC ) ) for store - operated Ca 2 + entry ( SOCE ) . The intracellular Ca 2 + influx is also mediated by transient receptor potential channels ( TRPCs ) , most of which are activated by depletion of Ca 2 + from the ER and act as CRACs . The plasma membrane Ca 2 + ATPases ( PMCAs ) function to export Ca 2 + from the cytosol and maintain the intracellular Ca 2 + concentration at the basal value for proper cell signalling . In addition to the ER , lysosomes have recently been recognized as the second largest store of intracellular Ca 2 + , and they are able to release Ca 2 + through TRPC mucolipin 1 ( TRPML1 ) , which is crucial for maintaining correct lysosomal membrane trafficking .

The role of mitochondria in many Ca 2 + sig - nalling pathways depends on close interactions with the ER Ca 2 + store and the formation of ER – mitochondria con - tact sites . The distance between the ER and the mitochon - drion at these sites varies between 10 nm and 60 nm 52 , and the ER associates more frequently with mitochondria than with other organelles 53 , 54 . Upon opening of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 Rs , this allows mitochondria to be exposed to micro - domains of high [ Ca 2 + ] that are necessary to induce Ca 2 + accumulation through the low - affinity MCU complex . These synaptic - like , inter - organelle associations , called mitochondria - associated membranes ( MAMs ) 55 , are small enough to allow contact between proteins on the surface of both organelles and ensure that upon induction of Ca 2 + mobilization the [ Ca 2 + ] on the cytosolic surface of the OMM reaches levels tenfold higher than those in the bulk cytosol 56 ( fig . 2a ) . Conversely , the [ Ca 2 + ] to which the OMM is exposed during SOCE is similar in mitochondria located near the plasma membrane and those located in other intracellular areas . However , mitochondria can also form associations with the plasma membrane , called plasma membrane - associated mito - chondria ( PAM ) 57 , where mitochondria are exposed to a threefold higher [ Ca 2 + ] upon activation of voltage - gated Ca 2 + channels in the plasma membrane 56 . Mitochondrial Ca 2 + efflux Historically , two major systems have been postu - lated to extrude Ca 2 + from the mitochondrial matrix : the mitochondrial Na + / Ca 2 + exchanger ( mNCX ) and the mitochondrial H + / Ca 2 + exchanger ( mHCX ) . The first appears to be the predominant antiporter in excitable tissues ( heart and brain ) , whereas the latter mainly leads to Ca 2 + release in non - excitable tissues ( liver and kidney ) . The stoichiometry of mNCX - driven transport is defined as electrogenic , with three ( or four ) Na + for one Ca 2 + ( refs 58 , 59 ) , whereas the exchange ratio of mHCX is electroneutral ( two H + for one Ca 2 + ) 60 ( fig . 2d ) . Thus , the two Ca 2 + efflux systems mediate the extrusion of Ca 2 + from the mitochondrial matrix towards the IMS , reaching the cytosolic compartment by VDACs or addi - tional Ca 2 + - extruding mechanisms located at the OMM , such as the NCX family member NCX3 ( also known as SLC8A3 ) ( ref . 61 ) . Although Na + - dependent and Na + - independent Ca 2 + exit mechanisms have been described since the 1970s , the molecular identities of the different components of mitochondrial Ca 2 + efflux were revealed only a few years ago . In 2010 , mNCX function was ascribed to NCLX ( also known as SLC8B1 ) , a product of mammalian SLC8B1 ( ref . 62 ) . NCLX mediates not only Na + / Ca 2 + exchange but also Li + - dependent Ca 2 + transport , which was previously described for NCXs 63 . This property of NCLX , together with its confirmed mitochondrial localization , its sen - sitivity to the classical NCX inhibitor CGP - 37157 and observations in multiple cell types that loss of NCLX alters mitochondrial Ca 2 + efflux 62 , 64 – 66 , provides strong indication that NCLX is the mNCX . Whereas the molecular nature of the mNCX is gener - ally accepted today , the identity of the mHCX is more con - troversial . In 2009 , it was proposed that the IMM protein LETM1 acts as mHCX in both fly and mammalian cells as well as in vitro in proteoliposomes 20 . LETM1 might oligomerize into hexameric structures , thus acting as a transporter , even though it contains only a single trans - membrane helix 67 . However , the role of LETM1 in Ca 2 + release from the mitochondrial matrix has been ques - tioned 68 ; indeed , LETM1 was first reported as a K + / H + exchanger 69 – 71 , and some LETM1 - related features described in initial studies , such as a stoichiometry of one H + for one Ca 2 + and sensitivity to the MCU inhibitor ruthenium red 20 , conflict with those originally described for mHCX . Novel findings obtained with a highly purified LETM1 - containing liposome system have partially clari - fied these issues , suggesting an electroneutral transport of Ca 2 + and insensitivity to ruthenium red and CGP - 37157 and thereby reaffirming LETM1 as a strong candidate for mHCX function 72 . However , owing to the numerous Dissociation constant ( K d ) . A measure that indicates the strength of the binding interaction between a single biomolecule ( for example , a protein ) and its ligand or binding partner ( for example , Ca 2 + ions ) . The smaller the K d value is , the greater the binding affinity of the ligand for its target . Chemiosmotic theory states that the energy stored in the form of the transmembrane electrochemical gradient is used to produce ATP inside the mitochondrial matrix . The protons move back across the inner mitochondrial membrane through the f 1 f 0 ATPase enzyme , coupling the electrochemical gradient to ATP production by combining ADP with inorganic phosphate . Box 3 | Methods of measuring mitochondrial Ca 2 + Two main genetically encoded strategies are currently used to design functional probes that measure mitochondrial Ca 2 + concentrations : those based on the Ca 2 + - activated photoprotein aequorin and those based on the use of fluorescent proteins and dyes . using appropriate mitochondria - targeting signals , aequorin has been directed to both the outer mitochondrial membrane and the intramembrane space , although the most commonly used version is the aequorin chimaera targeted to the mitochondrial matrix by the pre - sequence of subunit vIII of cytochrome c oxidase 229 . recombinant aequorin binds Ca 2 + with an apparent dissociation constant K d of 10 μ m ( K d value for low - affinity , point - mutated aequorin is ~ 130 μ m ) . Aequorin provides important benefits , such as a wide dynamic range , a high signal - to - noise ratio and the ability to emit light upon Ca 2 + binding ( without requiring potentially damaging light excitation ) . However , the use of aequorin displays some pitfalls , including low light emission by the photoprotein , which renders it inappropriate for imaging Ca 2 + waves at the single - cell level . These disadvantages have led to the extensive employment of alternative methods , such as fluorescent protein - based approaches , which combine bright fluorescence with efficient targeting to cellular subcompartments through tagging with localization signals or synthetic fluorescent dyes , which can be directly loaded into cells without the need for transfection . rhod - 2 Am ( K d = 0 . 57 μ m ) is the most commonly used chemical probe , offering reliable results in saponin - permeabilized cells or isolated mitochondria . However , it cannot be precisely targeted to mitochondria in intact cells , and measurement of its signal exhibits multiple drawbacks 230 . mitochondrial fluorescent Ca 2 + indicators are based on Ca 2 + detection through a Ca 2 + - sensing protein , such as calmodulin , and they are classified into two families : the first family is represented by the cameleons , which are based on förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) ; the second family encompasses engineered single fluorescent proteins , such as GCaMP and pericam . These two classes of sensor allow ratiometric measurement of Ca 2 + levels . mitochondrially targeted chameleons include 2mt - D2cpv and its variants ( K d = 0 . 3 – 3 μ M ) and consist of cyan and yellow fluorescent protein pair , linked by calmodulin and the m13 peptide from the myosin light - chain kinase . mito - pericams ( K d of ~ 2 μ M for the most used variants ) are built up by combining a circularly permutated fluorescent protein and a Ca 2 + - responsive element . The development of mito - GCamP chimaeras ( K d of the semi - ratiometric , high - affinity 2mt - GCamP6m chimaera = 0 . 167 μ m ) and their derivatives , mito - CePIAs ( K d of the original CePIA2mt construct = 0 . 67 μ m ) and mito - GeCos ( 2mt - Gem - GeCo1 K d = 0 . 34 μ m ) has expanded the spectra for the analysis of mitochondrial Ca 2 + concentrations . Intriguingly , by fusing GFP and aequorin , a new class of ratiometric Ca 2 + probes , termed GAPs , has been generated 231 . GAP indicators have been targeted to various organelles , including mitochondria , but the performance of mito - GAP constructs has not yet been widely tested . nATure revIeWS | MoleCulAR Cell BIology R e v i e w s volume 19 | november 2018 | 717 conflicting results with respect to mitochondrial Ca 2 + levels observed in LETM1 - silenced cells 20 , 64 , 67 , 73 , 74 , addi - tional experimental evidence is required to firmly estab - lish the functional role of LETM1 as a component of the mitochondrial Ca 2 + efflux machinery . In addition , it has been proposed that LETM1 might promote mitochon - drial Ca 2 + entry under particular conditions , such as at low cytosolic [ Ca 2 + ] ( < 1 μM ) , functioning as a high - affinity Ca 2 + uptake system alternative to the MCU 20 . This concept has been confirmed by others 74 , 75 , but pro - gress in understanding the mechanisms of the MCU has diminished interest in such observations . Experimental evidence suggests that mHCX and mNCX cannot be the sole molecular pathways aimed to extrude Ca 2 + from the mitochondrial matrix . It has also been proposed that under certain conditions the transient opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore ( mPTP ) might represent an alternative Ca 2 + efflux pathway 76 , 77 , although other observations question this hypothesis 78 . Regulation of mitochondrial Ca 2 + Molecular studies have revealed that the heterogeneity of the machinery driving mitochondrial Ca 2 + exchanges is associated with an equally complex regulatory system , which operates at multiple levels to maintain physio - logical Ca 2 + homeostasis . Many proteins have been reported to be regulators of Ca 2 + uptake by acting on specific molecular components of the influx – efflux machinery , controlling mitochondrial membrane potential or regulating the association of mitochondria with Ca 2 + stores ( TABle 1 ) . Owing to their strategic position in the OMM , VDACs are the preferential targets for endogenous proteins located at the interface between mitochondria and the cytoplasm to control Ca 2 + influx into mito - chondria . This group of regulators includes BCl - 2 family members 79 . For example , apoptosis regulator BCL - X L interacts with VDAC1 and VDAC3 ( but not VDAC2 ) , shaping mitochondrial Ca 2 + entry by favouring Ca 2 + transfer across the OMM 80 . Mechanistically , BCL - X L was suggested to promote VDAC closure 81 , which would enhance its selectivity and permeability for Ca 2 + ( see discussion on VDACs above ) . However , this aspect remains largely unclear , and several reports contradict this potential mechanism . First , it has been reported that BCL - X L promotes the open VDAC state rather than the closed configuration 82 . It has also been proposed that VDACs can assume a cation - selective open confor - mation 83 . Finally , BCL - X L has been reported to inhibit VDAC1 activity , thus lowering , rather than increasing , the mitochondrial [ Ca 2 + ] 84 . Several intramitochondrial proteins have been sug - gested to regulate Ca 2 + signalling by altering MCU com - plex assembly or functions . The first , in chronological order , is MCU regulator 1 ( MCUR1 ) ( fig . 2b ) . It has been shown that MCUR1 binds to MCU at the matrix interface and that MCUR1 knockdown abolishes Ca 2 + uptake in intact cells 85 . The interaction between MCU and MCUR1 has been reported in other studies 86 – 88 , and MCUR1 was recently proposed to function as a scaffold in the assembly of the uniporter complex 89 .

The formation of microdomains of high Ca 2 + concentration between the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and mitochondria is critical for ensuring proper Ca 2 + entry into the mitochondrial matrix . a | The correct distance between the ER and mitochondria ( ~ 50 nm ) is preserved by different regulators , including mitofusin 2 ( MFN2 ) , the vesicle - associated membrane protein - associated protein B / C ( VAPB ) – protein tyrosine phosphatase - interacting protein 51 ( PTPIP51 ) complex and , at least in yeast , the ER – mitochondrial encounter structure ( ERMES ) complex ( in mammals PDZ domain - containing protein 8 ( PDZD8 ) has been identified as an orthologue of maintenance of mitochondrial morphology protein 1 ( Mmm1 ) of the complex ) . Once released by inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate receptors ( Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 Rs ) , the ER Ca 2 + enters mitochondria through outer mitochondrial membrane ( OMM ) voltage - dependent anion - selective channel proteins ( VDACs ) and thus reaches the intermembrane space ( IMS ) . b | Ca 2 + reaches the mitochondrial matrix via the mitochondrial Ca 2 + uniporter ( MCU ) complex , which is located at the inner mitochondrial membrane ( IMM ) . The MCU complex consists of the pore - forming subunit MCU and the transmembrane proteins : MCU regulatory subunit b ( MCUb ) and the essential MCU regulator ( EMRE ) in association with the IMS proteins : mitochondrial calcium uptake protein 1 ( MICU1 ) and MICU2 . MCU regulator 1 ( MCUR1 ) might regulate Ca 2 + entry from the matrix , but its role as a specific MCU complex component is highly controversial . c | The activity of the electron transport chain , a series of enzymes and coenzymes located in the cristae , results in the pumping of H + ions to outside the mitochondrial matrix , thereby generating an electrochemical proton gradient . This gradient consists of two components : the difference between the cytosolic and matrix pH and the membrane potential difference ( ΔΨ ) , which is maintained at approximately – 180 mV and represents the driving force for mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake . d | Mitochondria contain both Na + - dependent and Na + - independent mechanisms for Ca 2 + extrusion towards the cytoplasm . The molecular nature of the Na + / Ca 2 + exchanger ( mNCX ) has been identified in NCLX , an IMM protein containing 13 transmembrane domains and catalysing K + - independent electrogenic transport . Leucine zipper EF - hand - containing transmembrane protein 1 ( LETM1 ) has been proposed as the mitochondrial H + / Ca 2 + exchanger ( mHCX ) . It might act as a transporter by forming hexameric structures , exchanging Ca 2 + ions for H + ions in an electroneutral manner . However , it has been suggested that LETM1 acts as a K + / H + exchanger rather than an mHCX . Very recent findings have shown that LETM1 contributes to Na + cycling , thus modulating Ca 2 + fluxes in an indirect way 232 ( not shown ) .

Moreover , the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , which lacks any uniporter activity , possesses an MCUR1 ortho - logue ( found in mitochondrial proteome protein 32 ( Fmp32 ) ) , suggesting a function for MCUR1 outside the MCU complex . Indeed , MCUR1 has been described as a cofactor in the assembly of the respiratory chain rather than the essential component of the uniporter , indicating that the reduction of Ca 2 + uptake observed in MCUR1 - depleted cells may be due to an alteration of the mitochondrial membrane potential 90 . Notably , in hepato - carcinoma cells , MCUR1 was shown to regulate Ca 2 + entry in an uniporter - dependent manner , whereas forced MCUR1 silencing induced a decrease in ΔΨ ( ref . 91 ) , indi - cating that the role of MCUR1 in Ca 2 + uptake is complex and requires further investigation . Solute carrier family 25 member 23 ( SLC25A23 ) has been recently proposed as a novel regulator of the uniporter 92 , although its yeast homologue ( suppressor of AAC2 lethality ( Sal1 ) ) was originally described as a Ca 2 + - regulated mitochondrial ATP – Mg / P i carrier 93 , 94 . Several regulatory factors , shown in TABle 1 , have been reported to maintain the close association between the ER and mitochondria , thereby ensuring proper Ca 2 + transfer . Particularly worthy of mention are two proteins , mitofusin 2 ( MFN2 ) and PDZ domain - containing protein 8 ( PDZD8 ) . MFN2 was originally characterized as an ER – mitochondria tether 95 , but its role was strongly contested 96 , and it is still unclear whether MFN2 pro - motes or inhibits ER – mitochondria contacts . PDZD8 , previously known as a regulator of retroviral infection 97 , has recently been described as the long - sought mamma - lian orthologue of yeast maintenance of mitochondrial morphology protein 1 ( Mmm1 ) , which is a compo - nent of the er – mitochondrial encounter structure complex ( ERMES complex ) and coordinates Ca 2 + exchange exclu - sively via its ER – mitochondria tethering role 98 . Finally , the molecular duo formed by the OMM protein tyro - sine phosphatase - interacting protein 51 ( PTPIP51 ; also known as RMDN3 ) and its binding partner at the ER , vesicle - associated membrane protein - associated protein B / C ( VAPB ) has been identified as a structural regula - tor of ER – mitochondria association 99 – 101 . Reducing the expression of at least one of these factors results in a strong decrease in mitochondrial Ca 2 + accumulation . Post - translational modifications represent additional layers in the regulation of mitochondrial Ca 2 + handling . The first post - translational modification associated with mitochondrial Ca 2 + regulation was phosphoryl ation , with the protein kinase C ( PKC ) family of kinases shown to be capable of finely tuning mitochondrial Ca 2 + homeo - stasis 102 . Recently , a phosphorylation - driven regu latory pathway for Ca 2 + efflux has been identified 103 , whereby two kinases ( PTeN - induced putative kinase 1 ( PINK1 ) and protein kinase A ( PKA ) ) positively regulate NCLX 103 . Intriguingly , PINK1 is also able to boost mitochondrial Ca 2 + extrusion by phosphorylating LETM1 at Thr192 ( ref . 104 ) . Function and interactions of VDACs with other molecular partners such as BCL - 2 proteins are affected by multiple phosphorylation events 105 . During hypoxia and inflammatory - mediated oxidative stress , the MCU can be targeted by reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , which promote S - glutathionylation of Cys97 of MCU protein subunits . This modification does not affect the inter - action of MCU with other uniporter subunits , but it increases the stability of the complex , thereby promot - ing Ca 2 + accumulation in mitochondria and augmenting the susceptibility to cell death 106 . In addition , the MCU can be subject to phosphoryl ation events . Proline - rich tyrosine kinase 2 ( PYK2 ) can target the MCU subunits , promoting the formation of multimeric channels 107 . In heart disease , a pool of Ca 2 + / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII ) localized to the mitochon - drial matrix can phosphorylate MCU protein at two sites ( Ser57 and Ser92 ) , resulting in a higher Ca 2 + response 108 . Interestingly , phosphoryl ation of Ser92 seems to be crucial for MCU activity in various contexts 86 , and the CaMKII – MCU axis has been shown to regulate vascular smooth muscle cell migration and neointimal hyperplasia after endothelial injury 109 . However , subsequent electro - physiological studies have failed to confirm the regula - tory effect of CaMKII on MCU 110 . No phosphorylation events have been associated with other uniporter com - plex components , although MICU1 can be methylated by protein arginine N - methyltransferase 1 ( PRMT1 ) 111 . Finally , the mitochondrial matrix AAA proteases have been shown to degrade unassembled EMRE , thus ensur - ing correct stoichiometry between the different complex subunits and preserving uniporter activity 112 , 113 . Overall , these observations demonstrate that mito - chondrial Ca 2 + uptake and efflux are regulated at multiple levels . An aberration in a single regulatory mechanism could result in the harmful remodelling of mitochon - drial Ca 2 + fluxes , which in turn could lead to detrimen - tal changes in cellular Ca 2 + homeostasis and specific pathological phenotypes ( see TABle 1 and below ) . Roles in cellular Ca 2 + homeostasis One of the main functional roles attributed to mito - chondrial Ca 2 + uptake is the ability to spatially remodel intracellular Ca 2 + signalling . Numerous correlative stud - ies performed in different cellular types have suggested that mitochondria shape the intracellular Ca 2 + response both locally and in the bulk cytoplasm . However , these observations were obtained using chemical compounds with low specificity that have a strong impact on mito - chondrial functions and thus on the whole cellular metabolism , producing some spurious and controver - sial results 114 . Moreover , the ability of mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake to shape the cytosolic Ca 2 + transient is strongly influenced by the cell type and density of competing Ca 2 + removal fluxes . For example , adult cardiac myocytes display very high Ca 2 + transport capacity by SERCA pumps and plasma membrane NCXs , which transport Ca 2 + out of the myoplasm 20 – 60 times more quickly than mitochondrial transporters under physiological condi - tions . Accordingly , in cardiomyocytes , the contribution of mitochondria to decreasing cytoplasmic Ca 2 + levels has been estimated to be < 1 % 115 , 116 . Conversely , in non - muscle cells with modest SERCA and / or NCX functions , mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake could be critical in termi - nating cytosolic Ca 2 + bursts and transiently buffering the intracellular Ca 2 + . Förster resonance energy transfer ( freT ) . A distance - dependent energy transfer process that involves a donor molecule in an excited electronic state that may transfer energy to an acceptor chromophore , leading to a reduction in the donor’s fluorescence intensity and excited state lifetime and an increase in the acceptor’s emission . its efficiency depends on the inverse sixth distance between donor and acceptor . Ratiometric measurement A measurement based on the use of a ratio between two fluorescence intensities that display a shift in their emission or excitation spectra when they bind to Ca 2 + . The intensity ratio is calculated at wavelengths for which the difference in fluorescence between bound and free indicator reaches its maximum . Mitochondrial permeability transition pore ( mPTP ) . A protein complex that , under certain pathological conditions , including Ca 2 + overload and oxidative stress , opens in the inner mitochondrial membrane , allowing the free passage of molecules > 1 , 500 Daltons and leading to mitochondrial swelling and cell death through apoptosis or necrosis . BCL - 2 family A large group of evolutionarily conserved proteins that share BCl - 2 homology domains . BCl - 2 family members are deeply involved in cell death regulation , consisting of both anti - apoptotic ( BCl - 2 and apoptosis regulator BCl - x l ( also known as BCl2l1 ) ) and pro - apoptotic ( apoptosis regulator BAx and BCl - 2 homologous antagonist / killer ( BAK ) ) factors . ER – mitochondrial encounter structure complex ( erMes complex ) . Characterized in yeast , a protein complex consisting of four core components , whose major function is to mechanically link the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) with mitochondria . www . nature . com / nrm R e v i e w s 720 | november 2018 | volume 19 The molecular characterization of Ca 2 + influx and efflux pathways has provided new evidence supporting the concept that mitochondria can act as bulk cytosolic Ca 2 + - buffering systems . During Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - mediated Ca 2 + release from the ER , the peak amplitude of the cyto - solic Ca 2 + signal is considerably lower in cells in which mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake capacity is increased by MCU protein overexpression 25 . By contrast , in PDZD8 - depleted neurons , in which ER – mitochondria tethering is disrupted , cytoplasmic Ca 2 + levels are elevated , and this increase can be related to reduced mitochondrial Ca 2 + - buffering activity 98 . Similar findings have been obtained in NCLX - silenced astrocytes 117 , although this effect is more pronounced upon SOCE than after empty - ing ER Ca 2 + stores . Thus , mitochondria promptly take up cytoplasmic Ca 2 + regardless of whether it derives from internal stores ( ER ) or the extracellular space . Depletion of MCU protein or UCP2 ( which , as dis - cussed above , contributes to MCU - independent Ca 2 + influx into mitochondria ) , with a consequent reduction of mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake , strongly inhibits SOCE by limiting the oligomerization of stromal interaction molecule 1 ( STIM1 ) and activation of ORAI1 ( ref . 118 ) ( fig . 1 ) . This phenomenon occurs only upon ER Ca 2 + store depletion through Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - generating stim - uli , whereas the loss of UCP2 or MCU protein does not affect STIM1 oligomerization and SOCE activation when Ca 2 + is mobilized by SERCA inhibition , which induces minimal and delayed mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake . Thus , the Ca 2 + - buffering capacity of mitochon - dria positioned at the opening of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 Rs could represent a pivotal mechanism in the modulation of SOCE , as previously suggested 119 . The cytosolic [ Ca 2 + ] affects the function of both ER - resident proteins ( such as Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 Rs ) 120 and store - operated Ca 2 + channels 121 , with high cytosolic Ca 2 + levels in the area surrounding the channels inhibiting their activity and reducing Ca 2 + release through the Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 R or Ca 2 + entry by ORAI1 . The strategic positioning of mitochondria in the vicinity of these channels lowers the [ Ca 2 + ] locally , preventing negative regulation and sustaining channel activity . Indeed , MCU protein loss impairs mitochondrial Ca 2 + - buffering capacity , which in turn limits CRAC channel function by enhancing Ca 2 + - mediated slow inactivation of the channels 122 . Similarly , the number of cytosolic Ca 2 + oscillations ( Box 1 ) generated by discharge of Ca 2 + from Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - sensitive stores is significantly lower in MCU protein - depleted cells , which reflects Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 R inhibition resulting from impaired mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake 122 . Overall , by controlling Ca 2 + channel functions and collecting large amounts of Ca 2 + in specific subcel - lular areas , mitochondria have the ability to preclude the propagation of Ca 2 + waves ( Box 1 ) , thereby regulat - ing specific cellular processes that depend on ( or that are regulated by ) Ca 2 + ( ref . 123 ) . For example , in pancre - atic acinar cells , mitochondria are distributed as a firewall along the border of the apically located zymogen gran - ules , confining the Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - evoked cytosolic Ca 2 + signals — which are important for granule release — to the apical secretory region through their Ca 2 + - buffering capacity 124 . A crucial role for mitochondria positioning in the regulation of spatially confined cytosolic Ca 2 + rises has also been described in neurons 125 . In neonatal cardiomyocytes , reducing mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake results in a prominent increase in the ampli - tude of beat - to - beat cytosolic Ca 2 + oscillations , which in turn contributes to extending the contraction of the cardiac muscle 126 . However , in adult cardiac myocytes , inhibition of MCU using either a pharmacological approach ( Ru360 ) or genetic knockout has almost no effect on cytosolic Ca 2 + transients 127 , 128 . Overall , there is strong evidence that mitochondria contribute to the regulation of cellular Ca 2 + both in the bulk cytoplasm and locally in spatially defined cellular subcompartments . However , several aspects of mito - chondrial Ca 2 + - buffering mechanisms require more clari fication , including the complex relationship between mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake and SOCE . For example , in breast cancer cell lines , abolition of mitochondrial Ca 2 + accumulation by MCU protein depletion has been observed to reduce 129 or marginally increase 130 SOCE . Although different experimental conditions might explain some contradictory results , other important factors should be taken into account , including the num - ber of mitochondria and their subcellular distrib ution , which can vary substantially depending on the cell type and condition 56 , 131 , and the impact of other organelles in the local buffering of cytoplasmic Ca 2 + ( refs 132 , 133 ) . Moreover , mitochondrial Ca 2 + transporters can also regulate SOCE independently of their contrib ution to mitochondrial Ca 2 + - buffering capacity . For example , upon ER Ca 2 + depletion , cytosolic Na + levels rapidly increase owing to the activity of canonical TRPCs at the plasma membrane 134 . This increase in cytosolic Na + promotes NCLX activity and drives mitochondrial Ca 2 + efflux , which lowers [ Ca 2 + ] in the mitochondrial matrix , thereby reducing the activity of the respiratory chain and in consequence lowering generation of ROS . Prolonged ROS production by mitochondria leads to SOCE inhib - ition via the oxidation of ORAI1 at Cys195 ( ref . 135 ) , and thus , NCLX activity contributes to sustaining SOCE through the regulation of ROS production . Pathophysiology of mitochondrial Ca 2 + Mitochondrial Ca 2 + has an important function in regu - lating cell fitness through its ability to impact cell ener - getics by activating oxidative metabolism , mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis 120 , 136 , 137 . Notably , however , deregulation of intracellular Ca 2 + and increased mito - chondrial Ca 2 + influx are potent triggers of necrosis , apoptosis and autophagy 138 – 140 . Thus , mitochondrial Ca 2 + homeostasis is intimately linked to both cell growth and survival and cell death . Bearing in mind this dual role , it is perhaps not surprising that mitochondrial Ca 2 + dynamics and their regulation have been implicated in various pathophysiological processes , including insulin secretion and diabetes , cardiomyocyte contraction and heart failure , inflammatory responses and pathological inflammation and neuronal homeostasis and neuro - degeneration ( TABle 1 ) . These examples are discussed in more detail below . In addition , recent preclinical and clinical data have indicated that mitochondrial Ca 2 + deregulation is a novel feature of cancer pathology ( Box 2 ) . PTEN - induced putative kinase 1 ( PiNK1 ) . A serine / threonine kinase that is imported inside mitochondria in healthy conditions , whereas it accumulates at the outer mitochondrial membrane in dysfunctional mitochondria to promote their degradation through mitophagy .

Insulin secretion and associations with diabetes . Pancreatic β - cells are the body’s sole source of circulating insulin . β - Cells are specifically designed to synthesize and store large amounts of insulin 141 , which is secreted on the basis of the demand of target tissues . In healthy individuals , β - cells sense changes in plasma glucose concentration and respond by releasing corresponding amounts of insulin into the bloodstream . Despite dec - ades of research , the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of β - cells are not yet fully defined . Nutrient secretagogues , especially glucose , initiate downstream signals that enable β - cells to break down sugar and release insulin by stimulating mitochon - drial energy metabolism 142 . Glucose uptake induces glycolysis - dependent ATP increase . The resulting shift in the cytosolic ATP : ADP ratio leads to the clo - sure of ATP - sensitive K + ( K ATP ) channels on the plasma membrane of β - cells , eliciting plasma membrane depolarization . Once a threshold potential is reached , voltage - gated Ca 2 + channels in the plasma membranes of β - cells open , generating individual Ca 2 + microdomains beneath the plasma membrane 143 – 145 . The main role of the increase in sub - plasma mem - brane Ca 2 + is to permit insulin release 146 , involving the activation of PKC β - type II ( PKCβII ) and its trans - location to the surface of secretory vesicles localized in that area , although targets of PKC are not well charac - terized 147 . Insulin secretion is further promoted by mitochondria . In β - cells , a pool of mitochondria is strat - egically situated close to plasma membrane Ca 2 + channels , forming PAMs , where they are able to sense micro - domains of high Ca 2 + concentrations in their proximity , take up Ca 2 + through the MCU and fuel the exocytotic process by producing ATP , thereby sustaining and ampli - fying the phase of insulin secretion 144 , 148 , 149 . Moreover , the increased cytosolic [ Ca 2 + ] consequent on the opening of voltage - gated Ca 2 + channels promotes ER Ca 2 + accumu - lation and can lead to ER Ca 2 + release 150 through channels including RyRs 151 . This release can be followed by mito - chondrial Ca 2 + uptake at MAMs with consequent ATP production , further enhancing insulin secretion . Thus , the mitochondrial Ca 2 + machinery has a fundamental physiological role in glucose - mediated insulin secretion by supplying energy for the process ( fig . 3A ) . Defects in mitochondrial Ca 2 + homeostasis within pancreatic β - cells , with a consequent reduction of mito - chondrial ATP production and thus impaired insulin secretion , are considered some of the causal factors in the aetiology of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes 152 . In particu - lar , the er stress caused by ER Ca 2 + depletion could repre - sent the main factor contributing to mitochondrial Ca 2 + dysfunction , reduced ATP production and reduction in glucose - stimulated insulin secretion . Chronic ER Ca 2 + depletion owing to persistent leaky RyR channels is responsible for decreased mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake and β - cell failure 151 . It has been demonstrated that the activity of ER - localized TWIK - related alkaline pH - activated K + channel 1 ( TALK1 ) further exacerbates ER stress by increasing Ca 2 + flow 153 , thus contributing to islet dysfunction . Therefore , strategies to restore an efficient mitochondrial Ca 2 + response in these cells represent promising therapeutic approaches for the treatment of diabetes . Potential therapeutic targets include the MCU 73 and its regulatory partner MICU1 ( ref . 154 ) , which are required for the feedforward mechanism of Ca 2 + entry into mitochondria and guarantee insulin secretion in β - cells , as well as ER channels ( for example , TALK1 ) , the inhibition of which could reduce ER Ca 2 + handling defects in β - cells during the pathogenesis of diabetes . Cardiac cell functions and heart failure . Ca 2 + is of vital importance for maintaining cardiac cell function , as it is a key modulator of cardiac functional cycle ( excita - tion , contraction or diastole , and relaxation or systole ) . Moreover , it also has a key role in the pathology of heart failure , being responsible for cardiac cell death via apoptotic and necrotic pathways 155 . Under physiological conditions , Ca 2 + signalling in the heart exerts three main functions : controlling the so - called excitation – contraction coupling ( EC coupling ) , excitation – transcription coupling ( ET coupling ) and excitation – metabolism coupling ( EM coupling ) mecha - nisms . While EC and ET coupling are governed essen - tially by cytosolic Ca 2 + transients that drive contraction and cardiac muscle gene activation or inactivation , mitochondrial Ca 2 + contributes to the local control of oxidative metabolism ( EM coupling ) , generating the ATP needed to power cardiac excitation and contraction during every heartbeat 156 . In mammals , the cardiac cycle starts with the gen - eration of an automatic action potential in a group of specialized cells , named sinoatrial nodal cells , which autonomously produce the electrical cardiac impulse needed for the subsequent contraction ( of note , other cells within the conduction system have similar prop - erties ) . The action potential is initiated with a change in membrane potential , which becomes more pos - itive , mainly owing to the opening of Na + channels and flow of Na + into the cell . This depolarization , also called funny current ( I f ) 157 , 158 , induces a progressive opening of T type ( transient opening Ca 2 + channels ( TTCCs ) ) and L type Ca 2 + channels ( long - lasting Ca 2 + channels ( LTCCs ) ) , eventually triggering a cytosolic Ca 2 + influx 159 , 160 . The cytosolic Ca 2 + influx through LTCCs is sufficient to regulate and activate mitochondrial func - tions and thus ATP production 161 through the generation of Ca 2 + microdomains around nearby mitochondria . Ca 2 + influx through LTCCs also triggers Ca 2 + release from the nearby junctional SR ( the portion of SR in association with other membrane structures , such as sarcolemma ) via intracellular Ca 2 + release channels in a process known as Ca 2 + - induced Ca 2 + release ( CICR ) , which is crucial for muscle contraction 162 , 163 . The high local cytosolic [ Ca 2 + ] generated during CICR initiates contraction ( EC cou - pling ) by binding troponin C ( TN - C ) on myofilaments 164 and boosts mitochondrial metabolism by promoting Ca 2 + uptake into mitochondria 165 . Only the generation of well - defined mitochondrial Ca 2 + microdomains , either at the entrance of voltage - gated Ca 2 + channels at the plasma membrane ( sarcolemma ) after LTCC opening or Nutrient secretagogues substances that promote secretion . ER stress A stressful condition of the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) that triggers a signalling cascade , termed the unfolded protein response , which is aimed to restore er homeostasis . Excitation – contraction coupling ( eC coupling ) . A process whereby the action potential travelling along the plasmalemma evokes initiation of mechanical shortening of the myofibrils through Ca 2 + release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum .

A component of the troponin complex , together with troponin i and troponin T , which regulates muscle contraction by Ca 2 + binding .

A rapid increase in mitochondrial Ca 2 + is essential for telegraphing the enhanced metabolic demand for ATP necessitated by muscle contraction to increased production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation . Thus , mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake is fundamental for providing the necessary link between the ATP supply and demand during cardio myocyte contraction ( fig . 3B ) . In this con - text , MCU activity functions to increase heartbeat fre - quency by favouring rapid Ca 2 + mitochondrial uptake during the cardiac cycle 126 . Oxidative phosphorylation enhanced by MCU activity is also required for reload - ing SR Ca 2 + stores and sustaining increased heart rate (cid:19) (cid:20) (cid:19) (cid:26) (cid:25) (cid:27) (cid:21)

The generation of high Ca 2 + microdomains at membrane contact sites . Mitochondria - associated membranes ( MAMs ) ( established between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) ) or plasma membrane - associated membranes ( PAMs ) are fundamental to permit mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake through the mitochondrial Ca 2 + uniporter ( MCU ) complex and for many cellular functions . A | In pancreatic β - cells , glucose uptake ( 1 ) induces ATP production via glycolysis ( 2 ) . The increased metabolism inhibits ATP - sensitive K + channels ( K ATP channels ) ( 3 ) and permits the opening of transient opening Ca 2 + channels ( TTCCs ) and long - lasting Ca 2 + channels ( LTCCs ) on the plasma membrane ( 4 ) and in turn insulin release assisted by protein kinase C β - type ( PKC β ) ( 5 ) . The increase in cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration ( [ Ca 2 + ] ) also promotes mitochondrial ATP production from mitochondria at PAMs ( 6 ) , increased ER Ca 2 + concentration ( 7 ) and , in turn , increased ER Ca 2 + release by inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate receptors ( Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 Rs ) and / or by ryanodine receptors ( RyRs ) ( 8 ) , and mitochondrial ATP production at MAMs ( 9 ) . B | In cardiac cells , during an action potential , the Na + inward current ( funny current ( I f ) ) ( 1 ) leads to opening of LTCCs and / or TTCCs ( 2 ) . The cytosolic increase in Ca 2 + is captured by mitochondria at PAMs to produce ATP ( 3 ) ; it also induces Ca 2 + - induced Ca 2 + release ( CICR ) from the ER through RyRs ( 4 ) that permits cardiac muscle contraction ( 5 ) and sustains mitochondrial metabolism and the ATP production that supports contraction ( 6 ) . C | In epithelia , different chronic stress situations , including tissue damage or infection ( 1 ) , induce ER stress ( 2 ) with a consequent , prolonged Ca 2 + transfer towards mitochondria at MAMs and mitochondrial Ca 2 + overload ( 3 ) . This Ca 2 + overload induces a strong inflammatory response mediated by the activation of the NACHT , LRR and PYD domains - containing protein 3 ( NLRP3 ) inflammasome , which is essential for the production of interleukin - 1 β ( IL - 1 β ) and other pro - inflammatory mediators , and by activation of mitochondrial antiviral signalling ( MAVS ) complexes , which could interact with the MCU complex to positively regulate the release of the pro - inflammatory cytokine interferon - β ( IFN β ) . D | Mitochondria are key for buffering Ca 2 + in neurons . Da | Under normal stimulation , action potential generation ( 1 ) promotes Ca 2 + entry through voltage - gated Ca 2 + channels ( VGCCs ) in presynaptic cells ( 2 ) and mitochondria efficiently buffer Ca 2 + ( 3 ) to ensure moderate neurotransmitter release ( 4 ) . Db | During excitotoxicity ( 1 ) , higher levels of glutamate released from presynaptic cells ( 2 ) induce excessive activation of N - methyl - d - aspartate receptors ( NMDARs ) and Ca 2 + entry into postsynaptic cells ( 3 ) , with consequent mitochondrial Ca 2 + overload ( 4 ) and the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore ( mPTP ) ( 5 ) , which promotes apoptosis . SR , sarcoplasmic reticulum . nATure revIeWS | MoleCulAR Cell BIology R e v i e w s volume 19 | november 2018 | 723 during the fight - or - flight response 166 . The crucial role of MCU - mediated Ca 2 + uptake in preserving cardiovascular homeostasis is supported by the observation that Mcu + / – female mice exhibit a decreased cardiac stroke volume ( the amount of blood pumped by the left ventricle in one contraction ) and that MICU2 loss predisposes to lethal abdominal aortic aneurysms 167 . Undoubtedly , mitochondria in cardiomyocytes are far from being only passive Ca 2 + sinks — they are able to sense cytosolic Ca 2 + signals and transform them into mitochondrial energy production . It remains controver - sial , though , whether variations in the mitochondrial [ Ca 2 + ] occur quickly in a beat - to - beat fashion , taking place synchronously with cytosolic Ca 2 + fluctuations , or whether Ca 2 + uptake can occur slowly 168 . Recent data suggest the existence of subpopulations of mitochondria exposed to high levels of [ Ca 2 + ] with the ability to take up Ca 2 + on a beat - to - beat basis 116 , 128 . The new mechanistic understanding of MCU complex functions and advance - ments in Ca 2 + measurement technologies ( Box 3 ) will be instrumental in solving this issue . As mitochondrial Ca 2 + is fundamental for maintain - ing the ATP supply in myocardial cells , disrupted cardio - myocyte Ca 2 + homeostasis is recognized as a major contributor to the heart failure phenotype 169 . Acute heart diseases , such as ischaemia – reperfusion injury , are mainly attributed to mitochondrial Ca 2 + overload , which is evoked by a massive extracellular Ca 2 + influx , together with increased production of ROS caused by excessive mitochondrial respiratory chain activity , which by driving the activation of the mPTP leads to necrotic and apoptotic cardiac cell death ( Box 2 ) . Thus , targeting the regulatory systems of mitochondrial Ca 2 + homeo - stasis , such as the MCU complex and NCLX , as well as limiting ROS generation and mPTP activation , could represent a potential therapeutic strategy to combat these pathologies . The use of mPTP modulators , such as ciclosporin A ( CsA ) , which is a known inhibitor of the mPTP com - ponent cyclophilin - related protein ( CYPD ; also known as PPID ) , has been reported in experimental studies to reduce myocardial infarction size and to preserve cardiac function . However , in clinical trials , opposite effects were observed by the same group upon administration of CsA , thus failing to demonstrate a final and conclusive benefit for clinical outcomes 170 , 171 . Therefore , more specific and novel mPTP inhibitors , based on new findings regarding the molecular composition of mPTP 172 , are required to translate mPTP inhibition as a cardioprotective strategy into clinical practice . In parallel , other strategies targeting the regulatory systems of mitochondrial Ca 2 + homeostasis are being explored . Cardiac - specific inducible MCU - knockout mice 127 , 173 show drastic inhibition of acute mitochon - drial Ca 2 + uptake , which correlates with a slowed functional response to an acute increase in cardiac workload , although the basal mitochondrial [ Ca 2 + ] appears remarkably normal . These animals are strongly protected from the damage resulting from ischaemia – reperfusion injury 127 , 173 , which is consistent with previ - ous results obtained in isolated hearts treated with the MCU inhibitor Ru360 ( ref . 174 ) . In agreement with this view , the increased MCU current induced by activation of CaMKII during ischaemia – reperfusion injury was shown to promote mPTP opening and myocardial cell death 108 . These data support MCU as a potential new target for cardioprotective drug design . However , the role of MCU in ischaemia – reperfusion injury is highly debated , as is its modulation by CaMKII ( see section above ) . Indeed , animals with whole - body MCU dele - tion and mice with myocardial MCU inhibition through the expression of a dominant - negative form of MCU protein — generated in a mixed genetic background — are unable to accumulate Ca 2 + inside the matrix but show no protection against ischaemia – reperfusion injury - driven damage 175 – 177 . Intriguingly , CsA administration is strongly cardioprotective in wild - type but not in MCU - null hearts 175 , suggesting that the myocardial cell death occurring in whole - body MCU - knockout mice sub - jected to ischaemia – reperfusion injury is independent of canonical Ca 2 + - dependent mPTP functions . Of note , deletion of MCU in a pure background is embryonic lethal , probably owing to cardiac defects , suggesting that the mixed genetic background , by as yet unknown mechanisms , masks the crucial role of mitochondrial Ca 2 + in development and cardiovascular homeostasis . In addition to MCU - mediated Ca 2 + uptake , it has recently been identified that Ca 2 + efflux from mito - chondria is essential for maintaining cardiac cellular function . Targeting NCLX by increasing its expression is sufficient to prevent mitochondrial Ca 2 + overload and to limit mPTP opening , with a consequent reduction in myocardial infarction size and decreased cell death after ischaemia – reperfusion injury 66 . Although NCLX deletion in adult cardiomyocytes elicits sudden death , germline cardiac - specific knockout does not cause heart failure 66 . Moreover , whole - body NCLX - knockout mice are viable , and they do not suffer from severe cardiac failure ( I . Sekler , personal communication ) . However , they show a range of symptoms that includes cognitive impairment , reduced brown fat thermogeneration and defective T cells . Thus , a still unknown mechanism could exist in the newborn animals that compensates for whole - body loss of NCLX , explaining the mild phenotype observed in whole - body knockout mice . The maintenance of contact sites between the SR and mitochondria also contributes to the damage asso - ciated with ischaemia – reperfusion injury . In particular , downregulation of PTPIP51 , a crucial regulator of ER – mitochondria and SR – mitochondria contacts ( TABle 1 ) , protects cardiomyocytes from mitochondrial Ca 2 + over - load and cell death , highlighting its potential as a new therapeutic target for alleviating heart damage after ischaemia – reperfusion injury 178 . In chronic heart failure , major myocyte dysfunction is related to accumulation of cytoplasmic Ca 2 + . This defect in failing cells largely results from decreased expression and activity of the SR Ca 2 + ATPase 179 and increased RyR Ca 2 + leakage 180 ( in particular , RyR2 ) owing to their redox modifications 181 , 182 or phosphorylation by CaMKII 183 and PKA 184 . The consequent high amount of Ca 2 + that persists in the cytoplasm could result in mitochondrial Ca 2 + overload and dysfunction , thereby contributing to heart failure and myocyte cell death 185 , 186 . In parallel , Myofilaments The principal molecular regulators of contraction in cardiac and skeletal muscles , responsible for force generation and motion . Myofilaments consist primarily of thick filament myosin and thin filament actin proteins , as well as additional components , including troponin , titin and nebulin . Fight - or - flight response The physiological reaction that helps an animal in response to emergency situations such as a harmful event or an attack . www . nature . com / nrm R e v i e w s 724 | november 2018 | volume 19 deprivation of SR Ca 2 + stores also means that less Ca 2 + can be released from the SR upon LTCC activation , resulting in a decreased magnitude of Ca 2 + transients and reduced mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake upon stim - ulation , which in turn reduces ATP supply , leading to contractile dysfunction 187 . Induction of SR Ca 2 + leakage is also sufficient to induce spontaneous action poten - tials and is therefore considered an important trigger for cardiac arrhythmias 188 , 189 . In addition , heart failure is frequently associated with an elevation of intracellular Na + concentration , which induces higher NCLX activity , thereby limiting the ability of mitochondrial [ Ca 2 + ] to rise to levels sufficient to support the robust ATP prod - uction required to match the increased energy demand necessary for contraction 190 . Overall , these findings suggest that targeting both MCU and NCLX to prevent mitochondrial Ca 2 + over - load in combination with systems to reduce SR Ca 2 + mishandling could represent an effective strategy for the treatment of heart failure . Inflammatory responses and pathological inflam - mation . The first evidence that mitochondrial Ca 2 + is important during inflammation dates back more than 30 years 191 , but increasing interest in this area has become evident only since the molecular identity of the MCU complex and identification of the mitochondrial locali zation o f t he NACHT , lrr and PYD domains - containing protein 3 inflammasome ( NLRP3 inflammasome ) 192 . Studies have highlighted how chronic stress increases mitochondrial Ca 2 + accumulation , which in turn induces excessive and sustained inflammation . Mitochondrial Ca 2 + homeostasis has been reported to be disrupted in infectious diseases , where MCU seems to be the main player in the regulation of bacteria - induced and virus - induced activation of inflammation ( fig . 3C ) . Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection of airway epithe - lial cells from patients with cystic fibrosis drives exces - sive MCU - mediated mitochondrial Ca 2 + accumulation , which is critical for the activation of NLRP3 - dependent inflammatory response , which exacerbates the patho - logy of cystic fibrosis 193 . Loss of MCU in vitro has been shown to reduce mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake and to blunt activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome induced by P . aeruginosa 193 . MCU - mediated Ca 2 + overload has also been found to be essential for a virus - induced inflammatory response . Viral infections perturb Ca 2 + homeostasis , by increas - ing either ER Ca 2 + release or extracellular Ca 2 + influx , thereby promoting Ca 2 + influx into mitochondria . MCU specifically interacts with mitochondrial antiviral signalling ( MAVS ) complexes localized on mitochondria and posi tively regulates the release of the pro - inflammatory cytokine interferon - β ( IFNβ ) upon viral infection 194 . Chronic viral infection is accompanied by ER stress , inducing mitochondrial Ca 2 + overload through an MCU – MAVS - dependent pathway , with subsequent sustained IFNβ production that contributes to auto - immune diseases . Knockdown or silencing of MCU ( or MAVS ) reduces mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake capacity and decreases virus - induced IFNβ levels 194 and thus the inflammatory response . The importance of regulating MCU under stress conditions , when the risk of Ca 2 + overload is elevated , has also been reported in a model of the inflammatory response induced after tissue injury in the liver . During liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy , loss of MICU1 , the Ca 2 + - sensing regulator of MCU , leads to an enhanced and sustained pro - inflammatory response , which is associated with mitochondrial Ca 2 + overload . The mitochondrial Ca 2 + overload response is followed by mPTP opening , sensitizing MICU1 - deficient hepato - cytes to cell death instead of permitting cell proliferation and regeneration 195 . These findings all support the notion that increased Ca 2 + flux through the MCU complex fuels important pathways related to inflammatory responses , identify - ing this complex as a potential target in the treatment of inflammation - associated diseases . Neuronal homeostasis and neurodegeneration . Ca 2 + is the major signalling molecule connecting neuronal depolar ization to synaptic activity . Through their posi - tioning at the mouth of the Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P3Rs or close to the plasma membrane to take up Ca 2 + from the ER or to modulate extracellular Ca 2 + entry , respectively , mito - chondria have a primary function in shaping cytosolic Ca 2 + oscillations . Moreover , Ca 2 + sequestration by mito - chondrial buffering systems located at synaptic regions affects neurotransmitter release 125 ( fig . 3Da ) . Therefore , both defects in mitochondrial positioning and toxic changes in Ca 2 + buffering could contribute to differ - ent neurological disorders 196 . In this context , the cell death - inducing sequence of mitochondrial Ca 2 + over - load , ROS formation and mPTP opening could impor - tantly contribute to neuronal pathology , particularly neurodegeneration . For example , during excitotoxicity , postsynaptic neurons are subject to extremely high levels of glutamate , which induces excessive activa - tion of N - methyl - d - aspartate receptors ( NMDARs ) , increased Ca 2 + uptake and necrotic or apoptotic - like excitotoxic cell death ( fig . 3Db ) . Moderate NMDAR over - activity has been linked to apoptotic damage in many neurodegenerative diseases , and higher concen - trations of glutamate and necrotic cell death have been observed in the ischaemic core after a stroke 197 . Both pharmacological 198 and genetic 199 inhibition of MCU are able to suppress excitotoxicity , suggesting that this approach could be explored as a neuroprotective strategy in disorders with aberrant NMDAR activity . A therapeutic strategy based on MCU complex targeting has also been investigated for spinocerebel - lar ataxia type 28 ( SCA28 ) , an autosomal dominantly inherited ataxia caused by mutations in AFG3L2 and characterized by a loss of Purkinje cells 200 . AFG3 - like protein 2 ( AFG3L2 ) depletion induces an accumulation of MCU – EMRE complexes ( devoid of MICU regulation ) , which is concomitant with increased uptake of Ca 2 + into mitochondria , leading to high mitochondrial Ca 2 + levels and neuronal apoptosis 112 . Accordingly , MICU1 - knockout mice exhibit alterations in the post - natal arborization of Purkinje cells 35 . Furthermore , Afg3l2 - knockout Purkinje cells display altered mitochondrial Ca 2 + - buffering capacity — associated with disturbed NACHT , LRR and PYD domains - containing protein 3 inflammasome ( NlrP3 inflammasome ) . A complex whose formation leads to the activation of caspase 1 , the secretion of pro - inflammatory cytokines and the induction of inflammatory cell death ( or pyroptosis ) . Mitochondrial antiviral signalling ( MAVs ) . A CArD domain - containing protein located on the outer mitochondrial membrane . Excitotoxicity A pathological process by which neurons are damaged or killed by an excessive activation of receptors for excitatory neurotransmitters , such as glutamate . such hyper - stimulation produces a massive entry of Ca 2 + inside the cell and induces mitochondrial damage . N - methyl - d - aspartate receptors ( NMDArs ) . glutamate - gated cation channels showing high Ca 2 + permeability . They can be found at most excitatory synapses and exhibit the highest affinity for glutamate among the glutamate receptors . Purkinje cells A class of large inhibitory neurons located in the cerebellar cortex of the brain and characterized by an intricate dendritic arbor . They have crucial roles in motor coordination . nATure revIeWS | MoleCulAR Cell BIology R e v i e w s volume 19 | november 2018 | 725 ultrastructure and intracellular localization of these organelles — and reducing glutamate stimulation in these cells to reduce cellular Ca 2 + uptake could prevent their degeneration 201 . However , simultaneous deletion of Mcu together with Afg3l2 specifically in mouse Purkinje cells does not promote their survival 202 , sug - gesting that increased mitochondrial Ca 2 + is not suf - ficient to trigger the loss of Purkinje cells in SCA28 . Thus , although mitochondrial Ca 2 + overload is not the unique mechanism responsible for neuronal death , the restoration of normal mitochondrial Ca 2 + dynam - ics could represent a valuable strategy to limit Purkinje cell degeneration . Other neurodegenerative disorders , including amyo - trophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , Alzheimer disease , Parkinson disease and Huntington disease , display dys - regulation of Ca 2 + homeostasis , which in most cases has been attributed to alteration of the ER – mitochondria connection . In familial Alzheimer disease , mutated presenilin 2 increases ER – mitochondria tethering in an MFN2 - dependent manner 203 . The ALS - associated protein TAR DNA - binding protein 43 ( TDP - 43 ) dis - rupts the VAPB – PTPIP51 axis , leading to a decrease in ER – mitochondria contact sites and bioenergetic crisis 101 . A similar molecular mechanism has been described for α - synuclein 100 , which forms pathological aggregates in Parkinson disease , although other reports have demon - strated a pro - tethering role for α - synuclein 204 . In addi - tion to its ( contested ) role in ER – mitochondria tethering , α - synuclein localizes at MAMs and induces mitochon - drial damage , such as a loss of membrane potential and morphological alterations 205 . Other mitochondrial aberrations have also been associated with neurodegeneration . In multiple sclero - sis , tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) exposure affects mitochondrial membrane potential and reduces Ca 2 + uptake , which limits oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation and myelination of neuronal axons 206 . Reducing Ca 2 + - mediated mPTP formation by pharma - cological inhibition of CYPD confers neuroprotection in an autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of multiple sclerosis 207 . The genetic deletion of CYPD also exhibits beneficial effects in mice expressing ALS - linked mutants of superoxide dismutase - 1 ( SOD1 ) 208 , which are charac - terized by increased mPTP opening and aberrant Ca 2 + transients in astrocyte processes 209 . In Huntington disease , the mutant huntingtin ( mHTT ) , which mediates neuronal degeneration , inter - acts with Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P3Rs , causing a chronic ER Ca 2 + leak 210 . Notably , early in disease pathogenesis , the neg - ative effects of this leak can be compensated by reduced mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake capacity 211 , which can alleviate the mHTT - related toxicity by preventing mitochondrial Ca 2 + overload , mPTP opening and neuronal apoptosis . Overall , these findings support a central role for mitochondrial Ca 2 + in neurodegeneration : enhanced Ca 2 + uptake can promote mPTP opening and apoptosis , whereas too low of a mitochondrial [ Ca 2 + ] can affect the energy supply and the cytosolic Ca 2 + - buffering capa city . Thus , regulating mitochondrial [ Ca 2 + ] by re - establishing the proper ER – mitochondria association is essential to preserve neuronal homeostasis . Conclusions and perspectives A large body of evidence has accumulated regarding the molecular basis of mitochondrial Ca 2 + homeostasis , a pivotal regulator of many cellular functions . Mitochon - drial Ca 2 + has a crucial role in controlling mitochondrial functions and adapting mitochondrial activity to cellular needs , but it is also tightly coupled to the cytosolic Ca 2 + changes induced by a variety of stimuli . Importantly , genetic or environmental alterations in intracellular Ca 2 + signalling are linked to many human diseases , including common disorders and vari ous cancers ( Box 2 ; TABle 1 ; Supplementary table 1 ) . A complete understanding of the pathways allowing mitochondrial Ca 2 + entry and release will be crucial for characterization of the molecular pathways linked to mitochondrial Ca 2 + dynamics . In the future , it will be particularly important to gain a complete understanding of mitochondrial Ca 2 + regu - lation and its integration with other processes . This will include a molecular description of the newly discovered accessory proteins and post - translational modifications of mitochondrial Ca 2 + channels and transporters as well as a determination of a definition of the omic signature of mitochondrial Ca 2 + signalling by defining the role of mitochondrial Ca 2 + in genome , proteome and metabo - lome regulation . It will also be important to develop new drugs targeting mitochondrial Ca 2 + pathways . Classical inhib itors of MCU ( ruthenium red and its derivatives ) and of mNCX ( benzothiazepines , such as CGP - 37157 ) lack full specificity and could affect other important cellular functions , thereby confounding the experimen - tal findings . Ruthenium red also displays very low cell permeability , limiting its employment to isolated mito - chondria . Very recently , two compounds , DS16570511 ( ref . 212 ) and mito xantrone 213 , have been proposed as novel MCU inhibitors . The former inhibits mitochon - drial Ca 2 + uptake in intact cells and the perfused heart but requires further validation , and the latter has been extensively characterized but exhibits high cytotoxicity that could hamper its use in vivo . Building on this molecular description of mito - chondrial Ca 2 + regulation , it will be possible to better define the role of mitochondrial Ca 2 + signalling in many human disorders through the identification of specific mutations in the proteins responsible for the mainten - ance of mitochondrial Ca 2 + homeostasis . For example , considering the role of Ca 2 + signalling and mitochondria in neurons , the mechanisms of neurodegenerative dis - eases , as well as neuronal aberrations with more complex phenotypes , such as psychiatric disorders , will be better understood , and new therapeutic approaches will be proposed . Moreover , the contribution of mitochondrial Ca 2 + in cancer will be clarified , opening the possibility of modulating mitochondrial Ca 2 + homeostasis to increase the efficacy of cytotoxic agents . Finally , the emerging participation of mitochondrial Ca 2 + in the process of ageing 214 and its importance in stem cell biology 215 will produce new and exciting achieve - ments in the future and will attract scientists from other fields to this fascinating and still vastly unexplored area of mitochondrial biology .
