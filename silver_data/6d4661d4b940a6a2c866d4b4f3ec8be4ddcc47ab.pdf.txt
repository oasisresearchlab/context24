Correspondence : Jonathan Stoye . E - mail : jstoye @ nimr . mrc . ac . uk How do enveloped viruses bud from their host cells ? To understand how this process is achieved , several fundamental steps must be considered . First , viral structural components must be transported to the appropriate site , typically just under a cell membrane , and there assembled ( Figure 1a ) [ 1 ] . Second , the plasma membrane must be distorted to make a succession of curved budding structures ( Figure 1b , c ) ; this requires overcoming the mechanical bending resistance of the plasma membrane [ 2 ] . Third , following the formation of the bud , the virus has to pinch off and escape from the cell ( Figure 1d , e ) [ 3 ] . This involves machinery that constricts the neck of the bud , resulting in fusion between the membranes on either side of the neck and the release of the virus from the plasma membrane . Studies with a number of virus types , most prominently retroviruses , have now revealed that cellu - lar proteins that are intimately involved in intracellular mem - brane trafficking and receptor re - localization play key roles in facilitating these processes . For a long time , it has been known that the only retroviral component required for assembly and budding is the Gag polyprotein , which ultimately forms the viral core [ 1 ] . Gag is cleaved into a variety of smaller components as the virus matures . These include , from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus , the matrix ( MA ) , capsid ( CA ) and nucleocapsid ( NC ) . Depending on the virus analyzed , a variety of other protein products are seen after cleavage of Gag . For example , in human immunodeficiency virus - 1 ( HIV - 1 ) a short peptide called p6 is cleaved from the carboxy - terminal end of NC , whereas in murine leukemia virus ( MuLV ) a p12 peptide is cleaved from between MA and CA . Three types of functional domain of Gag can be identified : M , sequences required for transport to and binding of mem - branes ; I , involved in Gag - Gag interactions ; and L , late sequences [ 1 , 3 ] . The L domains are short peptide motifs located in different regions of Gag in different viruses ; mut - ation in these sequences results in failure to release budded viruses [ 4 , 5 ] . Many L domains are interchangeable between viruses , suggesting that their role in the late stages of budding is to act as docking sites for cellular proteins [ 5 - 7 ] . A key step in understanding the late budding process came with the demonstration that the L domain of HIV - 1 Gag interacted with a component of the cellular machinery responsible for sorting cargo into multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) [ 8 - 10 ] . MVBs are formed from early endosomes when their mem - branes invaginate into the endosomal lumen , resulting in Abstract Budding through the host - cell membrane is a key step in the life cycle of many viruses . Recent studies of retrovirus replication implicate a large number of cellular proteins in this process .

Mono - ubiquitination acts as a signal for directing proteins into MVBs , although it might not be the only signal , given that membrane proteins that are not ubiquitinated can also be transported to the MVBs . The formation of MVBs requires three protein complexes , which were first characterized in yeast and are collectively known as the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport ( ESCRTs ) [ 13 - 15 ] . ESCRTI and ESCRTII each contain one subunit that binds ubiquitin . ESCRTII is believed to function downstream of ESCRTI , as overexpression of the former can compensate for the loss of the latter , but the opposite is not the case . ESCRTII func - tions to recruit ESCRTIII to the membrane . Recent studies have confirmed the interaction between proteins of ESCRTs I and II and between those of ESCRTs II and III [ 16 , 17 ] . The full ESCRT complex is dissociated by the AAA ( ATPase asso - ciated with diverse cellular activities ) protein , Vps4 [ 18 , 19 ] . HIV - 1 interacts with the Tsg101 component of ESCRTI via a late domain within the p6 domain of Gag that contains the sequence P ( S / T ) AP ( in the single - letter amino - acid code ) . Depletion of Tsg101 results in production of a late - domain phenotype , similar to the stage shown in Figure 1d [ 8 ] . Arti - ficially recruiting Tsg101 into another late - domain mutant rescues budding activity [ 9 ] . These findings suggest that the ESCRT complexes might facilitate scission of the nascent virion from the cell . Very recent studies have shown that release of HIV - 1 can be blocked at a late stage by mutation or deletion of at least eight cellular proteins that are involved in the biogenesis of MVBs [ 17 ] . Other retroviruses containing different L domains , such as MuLV ( character - ized by a PPXY motif , where X is any amino acid ) and equine infectious anemia virus ( EIAV , characterized by a YPXL motif ) , do not interact directly with Tsg101 [ 3 ] . Budding of these viruses is arrested by dominant - negative mutants of various components of the MVB pathway , again implicating at least some portions of the endosomal sorting machinery in virus release [ 20 - 22 ] . In addition , some retro - viruses appear to contain two L domains that can contribute to virus release [ 23 , 24 ] . L domains are also found in the matrix proteins of rhabdoviruses [ 25 ] , filoviruses [ 9 ] and orthomyxoviruses [ 26 ] , suggesting that involvement of the MVB pathway may be a common theme in virus budding . Are these proteins the only cellular factors to play a role in virus budding ? The article by Wang and colleagues in this issue of Journal of Biology [ 27 ] suggests otherwise . It brings several other participants in the field of cell - membrane movement into play , with intriguing possibilities . Wang et al . describe the interaction between the Gag protein of the Moloney MuLV and components of the cellular endocytic machinery , the endophilins . The interaction was initially detected in a yeast two - hybrid protein - protein interaction screen using as its ‘bait’ the Gag protein from the MuLV - related murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( MAIDS ) virus . Subsequently , endophilin 2 was found to interact with the Gag proteins of MuLV and Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV ) but not of HIV - 1 , Mason Pfizer monkey virus 3 . 2 Journal of Biology 2003 , Volume 3 , Issue 1 , Article 3 Yap and Stoye http : / / jbiol . com / content / 3 / 1 / 3 Journal of Biology 2003 , 3 : 3 Figure 1 A schematic representation of retrovirus budding . ( a ) Gag proteins move to the plasma membrane and begin to associate with one another . ( b ) Formation of electron - dense aggregates under a deforming plasma membrane follows . ( c ) Bud curvature steadily increases . ( d ) Membrane fusion leads to pinching - off of the virion ; ( e ) proteolytic processing of Gag leads to virion maturation and formation of an electron dense core . L - domain mutants of most retroviruses arrest at a stage equivalent to ( d ) but with an extended stalk [ 3 , 4 ] ; in other viruses , such as human T - lymphotropic virus 1 ( HTLV - 1 ) , arrest occurs at a stage roughly equivalent to ( b ) [ 38 ] . MA , matrix ; CA , capsid ; NC , nucleocapsid ; Env , envelope proteins . Out Gag RNA Env In MA = CA = NC = ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) ( MPMV ) or simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) . MuLV Gag could also interact with rat endophilin 1 , another member of the endophilin family [ 27 ] . The interaction between endophilin 2 and MuLV Gag was confirmed using a fusion protein made up of glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) and endophilin 2 , attaching this to beads and using them to pull down Gag from MuLV - infected cells . Significantly , 0 . 7 % of the endophilin 2 present in MuLV - producing cells became incorporated into the virions . Inter - estingly , (cid:1) - adaptin and clathrin , two other components of the clathrin - mediated endocytic machinery [ 28 ] , were also found to be incorporated into MuLV virions . The region required for binding to endophilin 2 was mapped to the MA domain of the Gag protein . An intact endophilin 2 protein was required for Gag interaction , as determined in the yeast two - hybrid system , but various fragments of endophilin 2 could be incorporated into MuLV virions even though they did not interact with Gag in this assay . Overexpression of full - length endophilin 2 in MuLV - pro - ducing cells resulted in a dose - dependent reduction in virion production . Fragments of endophilin 2 were also inhibitory , but to a somewhat lesser degree . In contrast , an excess of endophilin 2 did not affect production of HIV - 1 from cells , ruling out the idea that the effects on MuLV are due to direct toxicity . This suggested that the specific binding of endophilin 2 to MuLV Gag plays an important role in MuLV production . It will be of considerable interest to determine where virus production is arrested in over - expressing cells . Inhibiting endophilin 2 levels by 80 % using a small interfering ( si ) RNA , however , did not seem to affect viral production . This was attributed to the potentially low levels of endophilin 2 required for virion production , or the presence of other members of the endophilin family that could make up for the reduction in endophilin 2 . Although perfectly plausible , these explanations do not completely dispel the uncertainty introduced by the nega - tive siRNA experiments . Hence , the conclusion that endophilins are absolutely required for MuLV budding remains to be confirmed by further experimentation . Relatively little is known directly about the function of endophilin 2 , but endophilin 1 is a 40 kDa cytoplasmic protein containing an amphipathic domain at the amino terminus as well as a Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain near the carboxyl terminus [ 29 ] . It is a multifunctional protein that is believed to participate in both early and late stages of endocytosis [ 28 ] , has lipid transferase activity [ 30 ] and is considered capable of affecting membrane curvature [ 31 ] as well as binding and deforming liposomes into tubules [ 32 ] . It can bind to proline - rich domains in multiple cellular pro - teins , including dynamin and synaptojanin [ 33 ] . The closely related endophilins 2 and 3 , though less well characterized , seem likely to possess similar properties [ 29 ] . Given the membrane - bending properties of endophilins , a role for this family of proteins in virus budding seems , at least superficially , an attractive hypothesis . But compared to endocytosis , MVB formation and virus budding are topolog - ically different processes , with endocytosis involving invagi - nation into the cytoplasm whereas MVB formation and virus budding involve evagination , away from the cyto - plasm . It seems likely that much of the protein machinery mediating these processes is fundamentally different ( for example , involving components of clathrin - coated pits versus the ESCRT complex ) . It seems quite feasible , however , that some proteins might be involved in both processes , particularly those with the ability to bend and fuse membranes . Certainly there is evidence for some cross - talk , as shown by the interaction between endophilins and ALIX , a key player in formation of ESCRT complexes and virus release [ 17 , 34 , 35 ] . Although significant steps have been taken towards under - standing virus budding during the past couple of years , there are still a number of important issues that remain to be addressed . How is the initial bud formed ? It may be that energetic requirements for membrane distortion can be met simply by the I - domain - mediated assembly of Gag mole - cules , resulting in movement of associated membrane lipid molecules [ 36 ] . But what happens in the case of viruses like MPMV that assemble in the cytoplasm ? Is there a need for cellular enzymes such as endophilin to introduce negative curvature ( bending towards the outside of the cell ) by mod - ifying the lipid composition of the membrane ? How does membrane pinching - off take place ? The ESCRT complex is intimately involved , but is the whole complex required and what is the role of other factors such as the ubiquitin ligase , Nedd4 , that are clearly involved in the budding of certain viruses [ 23 , 24 ] ? How is the plasma membrane targeted for budding ? In macrophages HIV - 1 can bud into vacuoles [ 37 ] , but what targets Gag and associated ESCRT complexes to the cell surface in HIV - infected T cells ? Given the pace of progress in this area , driven in part by the urgency of devel - oping novel antiretroviral drugs , we can be optimistic that these and related questions will soon be answered , bringing closer a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of virus budding and membrane remodeling .
