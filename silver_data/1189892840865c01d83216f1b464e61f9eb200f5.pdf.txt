Many diverse nat - ural , social and human made systems—ranging from food webs to human contact networks , to the Internet—can be studied in the context of network science . This the - sis is a compendium of research in applied network science , investigating structural and dynamical patterns behind the formation of networks and processes supported on them . Trophic food webs—networks of who eats whom in an ecosystem—have fas - cinated network scientists since data from ﬁeld observations of the gut content of species ﬁrst became available . The empirical patterns in food webs reveal a rich hierarchy of feeding patterns . We study how global structure of food webs relates to species immediate diet over a range of 46 diﬀerent ecosystems . Our ﬁnding suggest that food webs fall broadly into two diﬀerent families based on the extent of species tendency towards omnivory . Drawing inspiration from food webs , we investigate how trophic networks support spreading processes on them . We ﬁnd that the interplay of dynamics and network structure determines the extent and duration of contagion . We uncover two distinct modes of operation—short - lived outbreaks with high incidence and endemic infections . These results could be important for understanding spreading phenomena such as epidemics , rumours , shocks to ecosystems and neuronal avalanches . Finally , we study the emergence of structural order in random network mod - els . Random networks serve as null models to empirical networks to help uncover signiﬁcant non - random patterns but are also interesting to study in their own right . We study the eﬀect of triadic ties in delaying the formation of extensive giant compo - nents —connected components taking over the majority of the network . Our results show that , depending on the network formation process , order in the form of a giant component can emerge even with a signiﬁcant number of triadic ties . xii CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION We live in a connected world . Networks of nodes , representing agents , elements or entities , interacting via a set of connections or links are ubiquitous in nature , society and artiﬁcial systems . Ecosystems are often characterized by the trophic networks of food webs—feeding relationships between species [ 201 ] . Chemical reactions between molecules in cells lead to the study of interactomes—networks describing interaction relationships , typically between proteins [ 254 ] . A typical human brain consists of 10 11 neurons connected together via 10 14 synapses [ 80 , 117 ] resulting in a large network over which neural activity propagates . People are connected socially via various kinds of relationships—social friendships in real life [ 255 ] and on social media such as Facebook [ 155 ] and Twitter [ 146 ] , collaborations in science [ 180 ] , physical contact based on the proximity of interactions which leads to the study of human contact networks in epidemiology of infectious disease [ 72 , 141 ] , and many others . Power grids consist of generators , transformers and substations all linked together with high - voltage transmission lines [ 5 ] while the Internet is made up of computers connected to each other [ 194 ] . The ubiquity of networked systems has lead to the rise of network science—the study of the formation , structure and function of these systems . With the availability of data and increased computational power , network science has emerged over the past two decades as the de facto framework of studying complex , interacting systems . The main strength of the network science approach is its ability to abstract a variety of very diverse systems into the language of networks . The tools developed for studying generic networks are then readily applied to net - works arising from the observation of empirical systems . Techniques ranging from 1 CHAPTER 1 . INTRODUCTION 2 measurements of various network properties to building stochastic network models to explain the formation of real world systems have resulted in an unprecedented insight into the organization and function of complex networked systems [ 42 ] . In this thesis we study various structural and dynamical properties of networks— both with a view to studying empirical networks as well as random network models in their own right . The thesis is laid out as follows . Chapter 2 introduces the minimum background information on network sci - ence to follow the arguments developed in later chapters . We focus on deﬁning the most widely used network types and structural network properties in modelling real world systems . We also introduce the notion of random networks and their im - portance as null models of empirical networks . We motivate the study of random network models in their own right via highlighting some emergent properties ( e . g . vanishing clustering coeﬃcient , formation of a giant connected component ) in two popular random network models—the Erdős - Rényi random graph and the conﬁgu - ration model . We close our discussion by mentioning a number of other widely used random network models that are beyond the scope of this thesis . In Chapter 3 we study a particular example of a networked system—ecological food webs . Food webs , viewed as networks , are an abstract representation of who eats whom in an ecosystem . Theoretical ecologists have been fascinated by the intricate , non - random patterns observed in the structure of food webs as reconstructed by ﬁeld ecologists by examining species gut content or by direct observation of animal diet . This interest has resulted in a number of theoretical models of food web formation from simple rules to explain the observed structured in nature , however the existing models cannot fully account for all of the patterns . In this chapter we study the structure of 46 empirical food webs . We focus on the characterization of food webs based on local preying patterns formalized in the concept of network motifs . We show that almost all food webs fall into one of two families distinguished by the overall extent of omnivory , the tendency of species to consume prey from multiple hierarchical levels . We formulate a new food web model—the generalized preferential preying model—that can successfully produce artiﬁcial food webs belonging to either family and can replicate the structure of empirical food webs remarkably well . In Chapter 4 we move beyond structural analysis of networks by considering dynamical processes spreading through a network . Inspired by the model for food webs , we study how an initial pulse of activity spreads through these types of trophic networks . We study this under two paradigmatic processes—a complex contagion process inspired by epidemiology and a neural network process . Our results based on numerical simulations uncover that the topology of the network can have a signiﬁcant CHAPTER 1 . INTRODUCTION 3 qualitative impact on the spreading properties of both processes . The underlying topology can determine whether the pulse of activity will percolate through the entire network or remain conﬁned to a small subset of nodes , and also whether the activity will quickly die out or become endemic and endure indeﬁnitely . These results could help our understanding of many spreading processes naturally supported on top of network topologies such as epidemics , rumours , shocks to ecosystems , neuronal avalanches and many others . Finally , in Chapter 5 we combine both structure and dynamics of networks by studying how the structure of random networks changes as they undergo random link dynamics . A large number of empirical networks , particularly human social net - works , exhibit a large number of triangles or triadic ties which conﬁrms the common belief that a person’s friends are likely to be friends with each other . This observa - tion has spurred a large interest in studying random network models that can create a signiﬁcant number of triangles . Despite the plethora of theoretical research , some questions about such highly clustered networks remain evasive due do the edge inde - pendence assumption being violated and techniques developed for networks without triangles or small loops in general do not apply . In this chapter we explore simple relaxation dynamics of highly clustered networks to an unclustered ( uncorrelated ) equilibrium state under two link rewiring schemes . We study the evolution of the clustering coeﬃcient and the presence of a giant connected component . We ﬁnd that under both dynamics a giant connected component emerges via a continuous phase transition at a diﬀerent critical point than in equilibrium networks . Additionally , we derive time evolution equations for various general network properties . Our re - sults could help us understand the properties of random network ensembles better , speciﬁcally when dealing with highly unusual samples . CHAPTER 2 BACKGROUND Network science has exploded in popularity in the last couple of decades . Networks are used to describe diverse complex , interacting systems , from power grids to hu - man brain networks , and network science has become a paradigmatic framework of analysing complex datasets that admit a network interpretation . Despite the recent peak of interest in network science , driven by the avail - ability of data and increased computational power , the roots of modern network science date back to the early 18th century and Euler who studied the famous Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem [ 91 ] ( see Biggs et al . [ 40 ] for a reprinted and trans - lated version ) . This was the beginning of graph theory—the mathematical study of the properties of pairwise relationships of network structures . While graph theory has traditionally studied ﬁxed and immutable network structures , a probabilistic theory of networks was initiated by Erdős , Rényi and Gilbert in the 1960s [ 88 , 89 , 105 ] . This approach treats networks as random vari - ables and any ﬁxed network is assumed to originate from a probability distribution over networks or as a realization of some underlying random process . Network prop - erties are then studied as averages over the whole probability distribution under consideration . The probabilistic approach has been very successful at studying empirical networks because it recognizes the stochastic nature of network formation in the real world . Even though we only observe one realization of a real network structure at any given time ( e . g . the structure of the Internet , while changing over time , has a ﬁxed structure at any given point in time ) , the formation of it is assumed to be the result of some random process . The insight oﬀered by network science is then to measure 4 CHAPTER 2 . BACKGROUND 5 the properties of the empirical network and compare it to expectation values of various random network models in a quest to ﬁnd out the formation principles behind the empirical network . In many instances new random network models based on simple rules are formulated that can provide explanations for the empirical network structures we observe . This can lead to further insight about the function of the network . While random network models are often motivated by the need to study em - pirical networks , they are objects of interest in their own right . Random networks often exhibit a rich structural phenomenology as parameters of the network forma - tion process are changed . Furthermore , stochastic processes taking place on top of random networks can lead to new and interesting phenomena [ 77 ] . Tools from statis - tical physics are indispensable to studying random networks and random processes on random networks in their own right . In this chapter we introduce the the terminology and the fundamental deﬁni - tions of networks , starting from graph theory basics to introducing some of the most popular probabilistic network models . Often the networks studied in network science are called complex networks —this is to emphasize that most empirical networks as well as random network models have non - trivial structural features as opposed to simple networks such as regular lattices or trees . The majority of real - world exam - ples such as the Internet , the World Wide Web , social networks—are all complex but possibly in diﬀerent ways . Many random network models produce complex net - works because of the emergence of non - trivial patterns in the network formation process . While there is no universal deﬁnition of what exactly makes a network complex , the term is used to emphasize the lack of regularity and a high degree of non - trivial topological features which in turn motivates the methodology of studying these networks . 2 . 1 Complex networks A network is a collection of nodes , representing interacting agents such as people in a social network or species in an ecological food web , together with links , representing interactions between the agents , who is friends with whom in a social network or what species prey on each other in a food web . Networks are studied mathematically in the language of graph theory . Sometimes a distinction between networks and graphs is made in the literature , the former describing naturally occurring networked systems while the latter describing the abstract notion of a collection of nodes and links . In reality , both terms convey exactly the same meaning and information , so in the CHAPTER 2 . BACKGROUND 6 context of this thesis we will use the terms interchangeably . In graph theory terms , we represent a network as a tuple G = ( V , E ) where V is the set of nodes ( vertices ) and E is the set of links ( edges ) . It is customary to denote the number of nodes and the number of links as N = | V | and L = | E | respectively . We shall label the nodes by integer indices V = { 1 , . . . , N } and links by e ij ∈ E where i , j ∈ { 1 , . . . , N } are indices of the nodes at the ends of link e ij . A very convenient representation of a network is its adjacency matrix A . This is an N × N matrix whose entries a ij indicate a presence or absence of links between nodes i and j : a ij =   1 if e ij ∈ E 0 otherwise . ( 2 . 1 ) A network is undirected if its adjacency matrix is symmetric , that is A = A (cid:62) . Undirected networks are common models of systems in which interaction be - tween agents are inherently devoid of directionality . Examples include the Internet , composed of computers ( nodes ) and network connection between them ( links ) , co - authorship networks of scientiﬁc disciplines and sexual contact networks . Links can also have directionality . For example , a survey asking people to name their friends would likely result in some pairs of friends i , j only one of whom named the other as a friend . The World Wide Web—a collection of websites with hyperlinks pointing from website to website—is a directed network since hyperlinks need not be reciprocated . Similarly , food webs—networks of whom - eats - whom in an ecological community—are directed because prey rarely feed on their predators . In directed networks the adjacency matrix is no longer symmetric because of the inherently asymmetric nature of directed links . A network is simple if it does not allow self - edges ( self - loops ) , i . e . a ii = 0 for all i ∈ V , or multi - edges , i . e . E is a set rather than a multiset . In this thesis we will be mainly concerned with studying simple undirected networks ( Chapter 5 ) and simple directed networks ( Chapters 3 and 4 ) . More general types of networks are often studied . For example , weighted networks place diﬀerent weights or strengths on links to emphasize the often het - erogeneous importance of diﬀerent links ( e . g . the weights could be distances or throughput in a transportation network [ 151 , 187 ] , collaboration frequency in scien - tiﬁc collaboration networks [ 179 ] or strength of relationships in social networks [ 110 ] to name a few ) . Temporal networks assume that the connectivity of the network depends on time , i . e . the adjacency matrix is no longer static but is rather a func - tion of an independent time variable A ( t ) [ 119 ] . This approach is useful in studying CHAPTER 2 . BACKGROUND 7 evolving networks over time as opposed to static snapshots . Recently multilayer networks have become popular in modelling systems that consist of multiple distinct but interconnected networks [ 43 , 142 ] . These can be useful for studying systems such as transportation networks in which interchanges are served by diﬀerent types of transport links or social media networks in which users interact on several social media platforms . Many other types and generalizations of networks have been in - troduced , but we focus on simple undirected and directed networks in the following work . We now turn to describing some basic network measures and models which provide the basis of quantitative research in network science . While there is a large body of literature relating to a multitude of network properties and network mod - els , we have selected here some of the most fundamental concepts with particular attention devoted to those which will be the subject of study in later chapters . The material presented here can be found in a number of introductory books on network science [ 21 , 54 , 185 ] . A number of high quality reviews on research in network struc - ture and dynamics that develop these concepts have also been published over the years [ 6 , 42 , 77 ] . 2 . 2 Network properties 2 . 2 . 1 Network degrees The node degree is the number of links attached to it . Using the adjacency matrix , the degree of node i is given by k i = (cid:88) j ∈ V a ij . ( 2 . 2 ) The collection of all degrees { k 1 , k 2 , . . . , k n } deﬁnes the degree sequence of the net - work . In any undirected network we have the useful identity that the sum of all degrees equals twice the number of links ( since any link contributes to the degree of two nodes ) : (cid:88) i ∈ V k i = 2 L . ( 2 . 3 ) This is the so called handshake lemma ﬁrst proven by Euler [ 91 ] as part of the resolution to the Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem ( see Biggs et al . [ 40 ] for a reprinted and translated version ) . CHAPTER 2 . BACKGROUND 8 In directed networks , the directionality of links naturally leads to the notions of in - degree and out - degree , counting the number of links pointing to and away from a node respectively : k in i = (cid:88) j ∈ V a ji , ( 2 . 4 ) k out i = (cid:88) j ∈ V a ij . ( 2 . 5 ) The equivalent to the handshake lemma in directed networks does not have the factor of two since each link contributes one to total in - degree and out - degree count : (cid:88) i ∈ V k in i = (cid:88) i ∈ V k out i = L . ( 2 . 6 ) The mean degree of an undirected network is deﬁned as (cid:104) k (cid:105) = 1 N (cid:88) i ∈ V k i . ( 2 . 7 ) Combining the expression for the mean degree and the identity given by eq . ( 2 . 3 ) we get another identity , true for any undirected network : (cid:104) k (cid:105) = 2 L N . ( 2 . 8 ) This simple identity will be useful in Chapter 5 for deriving analytical expressions for various properties in random network models . The equivalent descriptions of mean in - degree and mean out - degree in di - rected networks turn out to be equal : (cid:104) k in (cid:105) = 1 N (cid:88) i ∈ V k in i = 1 N (cid:88) i ∈ V k out i = (cid:104) k out (cid:105) = : (cid:104) k (cid:105) , ( 2 . 9 ) leading to (cid:104) k (cid:105) = L N . ( 2 . 10 ) The density or connectance of an undirected network measures how many links are present in the network out of all possible links . In undirected networks this is given by ρ = 2 L N ( N − 1 ) = (cid:104) k (cid:105) N − 1 . ( 2 . 11 ) CHAPTER 2 . BACKGROUND 9 For directed networks , the factor of two is absent from the deﬁnition . A network in which ρ → 0 as N → ∞ is called sparse while for dense networks ρ remains non - zero . Equivalently , in sparse networks the number of links scales at most linearly with the number of nodes , L ∼ N , while in dense networks it must scale with the square of the number of nodes , L ∼ N 2 . Of course , the deﬁnitions of sparse and dense networks make sense only in the inﬁnite network limit , so they are of limited use to empirical networks . Nevertheless , most real world networks are in fact sparse [ 21 , Sec . 2 . 4 ] in the sense that L (cid:28) N 2 . The mean degree (cid:104) k (cid:105) and the density ρ together with the number of nodes N and links L forms a very basic but useful set of summary statistics to gauge the large - scale properties of the network in question at a glance . However , we can gain a lot more insight by studying the full degree distribution deﬁned as p k = N k N , ( 2 . 12 ) where N k is the number of nodes with degree k . The degree distribution has the in - terpretation that p k is the probability of selecting a random node with degree k . The degree distribution has become a crucial network metric because it was discovered that many network structures from diverse areas exhibit a common pattern—their degree distribution is a power law [ 20 , 22 , 194 ] : p k ∝ k − γ . ( 2 . 13 ) In directed networks , the degree distribution is bivariate : p kl denotes the probability of a random node simultaneously having an in - degree k and an out - degree l . The marginals p k = (cid:80) l p kl and p l = (cid:80) k p kl give the in - degree and out - degree distributions respectively . 2 . 2 . 2 Components Networks can be connected —meaning there exists a path between any two nodes i and j in the network—or disconnected , in which case the network consists of a union of connected components . Components are of interest because the size and number of these have a direct impact on any dynamics on the network . For example , a con - tact network that is fragmented into many small components is immune to endemic infections as any disease will not be able to spread beyond the small component it originated in . A disconnected component in a power grid could equally be immune from power outages originating somewhere else in the network or , to the contrary , suﬀer from a complete power outage due to having been disconnected from the main CHAPTER 2 . BACKGROUND 10 grid . There are two qualitatively diﬀerent types of components—the so called giant components and small components . In an empirical network it is common to ﬁnd that a large proportion of nodes form one , big component while the rest of the network is composed of much smaller components , disconnected from the largest component ( e . g . see ﬁg . 2 . 4 ) . Sometimes the largest component in an empirical network is called the giant component—however this is a slight abuse of terminology as there is a speciﬁc deﬁnition of what it means to be a giant component in network science . A giant component of a network model is deﬁned as a component whose size grows linearly with the number of nodes N while small components are those whose size remains constant . The component structure of directed networks is much more complicated [ 78 , 233 ] due to the fundamental fact that the reachability of node j from node i via a directed path does not guarantee the existence of a reciprocal path from j to i . Because of this , we distinguish several types of giant components in directed networks . A directed network can be decomposed into a giant weakly connected com - ponent ( GWCC ) , corresponding to the giant component if we replaced all directed links with undirected ones , and small directed components . Then , the GWCC can be decomposed further into the giant strongly connected component ( GSCC ) , in which there is a directed path between any pair of nodes , the giant in - component ( GIN ) , a set of nodes from which it is possible to reach the GSCC , and ﬁnally the giant out - component ( GOUT ) , formed by the nodes that can be reached from the GSCC . This is supplemented by a hierarchy of ﬁnite , directed structures called tubes and tendrils [ 233 ] . We will describe the formation of giant components in some random network models in Section 2 . 3 and the study of giant components in relation to network clustering will be the topic of Chapter 5 . 2 . 2 . 3 Clustering A network property that has attracted a lot of attention due to its prominence in social networks [ 246 ] is that of clustering 1 or transitivity . Clustering is concerned with quantifying the number of triangles—closed loops of length three—in networks . The importance attached to triangles in networks comes from the simple observation that in social networks it is highly likely that many friends of a given person will be friends amongst themselves—thus leading to the presence of triangles . 1 Not to be confused with ﬁnding closely related clusters of nodes as in community detection . CHAPTER 2 . BACKGROUND 11 The extent of clustering in an undirected network is generally measured by the clustering coeﬃcient ( sometimes called the global clustering coeﬃcient or tran - sitivity ) [ 185 ] deﬁned as C = 3 N (cid:52) N ∧ = tr (cid:0) A 3 (cid:1) (cid:80) i (cid:54) = j ( A 2 ) ij , ( 2 . 14 ) where N (cid:52) is the number of triangles and N ∧ is the number of connected triples in a network . Note that each triangle contributes three to the number of connected triples so that the factor of three in this deﬁnition normalizes the clustering coeﬃcient to be in [ 0 , 1 ] . This deﬁnition also admits a probabilistic interpretation—it is the probability that a randomly chosen connected triple is closed . An alternative to the clustering coeﬃcient is to consider the local clustering of each node [ 248 ] . The local clustering coeﬃcient of node i quantiﬁes how likely any two neighbours of node i are neighbours between themselves : c i = e i (cid:0) k i 2 (cid:1) = (cid:80) j , m a ij a jm a mi k i ( k i − 1 ) , ( 2 . 15 ) where e i is the number of such existing connections between node i ’s neighbours and (cid:0) k i 2 (cid:1) is the maximum possible number of such connections . Having computed this for all nodes , one can average to obtain the average clustering coeﬃcient of the network : ¯ C = 1 N (cid:88) i ∈ V c i . ( 2 . 16 ) Local clustering is mainly interesting because it has been shown to correlate with degree in many empirical networks [ 67 , 243 ] often as a power law c k ∝ k − α , where c k is the average clustering coeﬃcient across nodes with degree k . Note that despite their similarities , the global and the average clustering coeﬃcients are not equivalent , see ﬁg . 2 . 1 . Furthermore , it is possible to design networks whose global and average clustering coeﬃcients demonstrably converge to diﬀerent limits [ 217 , Apendix C ] . We shall favour the global clustering coeﬃcient because of its easier interpretation and calculation in Chapter 5 . Deﬁnitions of clustering have been extended to directed networks [ 93 ] , but the directedness of links have resulted in a proliferation of alternative deﬁnitions [ 54 ] . Instead , it is more common to analyse directed networks in terms of its motifs which we discuss next . CHAPTER 2 . BACKGROUND 12 1 2 3 4 Figure 2 . 1 : Example of a network in which C = 0 . 75 (cid:54) = 0 . 8˙3 = ¯ C . 2 . 2 . 4 Network motifs To reduce the complexities involved in studying large networks as a whole , a popular approach has been to focus on the occurrence patterns of much smaller subgraphs [ 171 ] . These smaller subgraphs called motifs 2 can oﬀer insight into the evolution and organization of a networked system . This is because the recurrence of certain motifs can signal a particular functional role in the network [ 171 , 222 ] . The study of network motifs is particularly popular in directed networks in which measures such as the clustering coeﬃcient can be diﬃcult to deﬁne . The smallest meaningful motifs ( beyond single links ) are the connected subgraphs on three nodes . In the undirected case there are only two such motifs—a triangle and a wedge which is not a triangle ( also known as a connected triplet or a 2 - star ) — which naturally leads to the deﬁnition of the clustering coeﬃcient—the proportion of wedges which are also triangles . On the other hand , in directed networks there are 13 possible motifs , see ﬁg . 2 . 2 . This number grows very quickly if we consider even larger structures—there are 6 motifs on four nodes in undirected networks [ 173 ] and 199 motifs in directed networks [ 206 ] . a b Figure 2 . 2 : The 13 unique connected motifs on directed networks . These can be separated into two groups : ( a ) ﬁve triads , S1 – S5 , that only contain single links , ( b ) eight triads , D1 – D8 , that have double links . Network motifs are interesting to study for the same reason as clustering— in many real networks some motifs are signiﬁcantly more abundant than others , 2 Sometimes the term is used to implicitly describe network subgraphs which occur at signiﬁcantly higher numbers than expected according to some null model , here our use of the term is synonymous with subgraph . CHAPTER 2 . BACKGROUND 13 especially when compared to some network null model . Practically , one measures the number of occurrences N M of motif M in the real network , generates an ensemble of random networks to act as a null model and measure the occurrences of M in each of the random networks . We can then write down a statistical signiﬁcance z - score for motif M : z M = N M − (cid:104) N M (cid:105) rand σ rand , ( 2 . 17 ) where (cid:104) N M (cid:105) rand and σ rand are the randomized ensemble average and standard devi - ation of the appearance of M in the random ensemble , respectively . Thus , if z M is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero , it can be evidence of diﬀerent mechanisms inﬂuenc - ing the evolution of the real network . The last question is , what null model to use ? A popular choice is the conﬁg - uration model which considers all networks with a ﬁxed degree sequence . We discuss random network models next . 2 . 3 Random network models Randomness is ubiquitous in nature . From a simple ﬂipping of a coin to explaining the physical phenomena in thermodynamics , random numbers , random variables and the framework of statistical modelling is an indispensable tool . The same is true for network science in which random network models play a role analogous to random variables in statistics or ensembles in statistical physics . The use of random network models in network science is twofold . First , they can serve as null models in hypothesis testing about real network formation . For example , comparing an empirical network such as a friendship network between schoolchildren to an ensemble of randomly generated networks with a ﬁxed number of nodes and links ( equal to the same quantities observed in the real network ) , we can test the hypothesis that social networks form completely randomly . If many of the network properties ( degree distribution , clustering , etc . ) in the artiﬁcial ensemble are not comparable to the same properties measured in the empirical network , we can reject the “full randomness” hypothesis and argue that there is evidence for some hidden mechanisms in social network formation or test the randomness hypothesis against some other random network model with more constraints [ 184 ] . Secondly , stochasticity is an inherent feature in empirical network formation . Indeed , at ﬁrst sight real networks like the one in ﬁg . 2 . 4 appear to be at least partially randomly connected and it is not unthinkable that in the real world there is a great degree of stochasticity when links of a network are formed . For example , CHAPTER 2 . BACKGROUND 14 we only observe a single snapshot of the World Wide Web of hyperlinks pointing from website to website at any given moment . However , arguably the appearance of the observed network has been inﬂuenced by many small , random events and if we were to turn back time and repeat the evolution of the World Wide Web , we would ostensibly arrive at a diﬀerent conﬁguration . One of the major aims of network science is to formulate network models that reproduce properties of real networks thus shedding light on the evolution and function of networked systems but in doing so it is crucial to consider stochastic models of network formation . The term complex networks emphasizes the point that real networked systems often exhibit non - trivial , highly irregular properties , often driven by inherent stochasticity in model formation , as opposed to the structural regularity of lattice models ( ﬁg . 2 . 3 ) often studied in statistical physics [ 153 ] . Figure 2 . 3 : Left : regular 2D lattice . Right : Erdős - Rényi random graph . Both networks have N = 100 nodes and L = 180 links . Figure created using [ 198 ] . These considerations motivate the study of random network models , both as models of empirical network formation and in their own right . There is a plethora of of such models , but we focus our discussion on two of the most inﬂuential ones— the Erdős - Rényi random graph and the conﬁguration model—which will also be the subject of Chapters 3 and 5 . 2 . 3 . 1 Erdős - Rényi random graph Erdős - Rényi random graph ( henceforth ER model ) , sometimes just called the ran - dom network model or the random graph , is one of the simplest random network models and the subject of the ﬁrst systematic studies of random network ensembles CHAPTER 2 . BACKGROUND 15 Figure 2 . 4 : Protein interaction network of yeast S . cerevisiae with N = 2018 nodes representing proteins and L = 2930 links representing binding interactions [ 254 ] . Figure created using [ 198 ] . CHAPTER 2 . BACKGROUND 16 Figure 2 . 5 : The network of the electrical power grid of the Western United States with N = 4941 nodes and L = 6594 links . The nodes represent generators , trans - formers and substations , and the links are high - voltage transmission lines between them [ 248 ] . Figure created using [ 198 ] . CHAPTER 2 . BACKGROUND 17 initiated by Erdős and Rényi [ 88 , 89 ] , and Gilbert [ 105 ] . The ER model , typically denoted by G ( N , L ) , as originally studied by Erdős and Rényi is deﬁned by placing a ﬁxed number of links L randomly between a ﬁxed number of nodes N , prohibit - ing the placement of multiple links and self - loops so that the resulting network is a simple undirected network . Because there are (cid:0) N 2 (cid:1) choices for placing L links , each G ( N , L ) network is only a speciﬁc realization amongst many potential candidates with diﬀerent placements of links ( see ﬁg . 2 . 3 for an example realization ) . As such , a complete description of the properties of the G ( N , L ) model would have to take into account the whole statistical ensemble of all possible realizations of networks . This is in fact a fundamental feature of all random network models—they are not deﬁned in terms of a single randomly generated network but rather as an ensemble of networks by assigning a probability distribution over all possible network realizations . For example , in the case of the G ( N , L ) model , the probability distribution P ( G ) over all networks G is given by P ( G ) = 1 / Ω N , L for all simple networks G with exactly N nodes and L links , where Ω N , L is the number of such networks , and zero otherwise [ 185 ] . A closely related model to the G ( N , L ) model is the G ( N , p ) model ﬁrst studied by Gilbert [ 105 ] . In this model , instead of ﬁxing the number of links L a priori , each of the potential (cid:0) N 2 (cid:1) links is realized with some ﬁxed probability p . The G ( N , p ) thus deﬁnes a diﬀerent ensemble of random networks since , unlike in the G ( N , L ) model , each network realization can potentially have a diﬀerent number of links . The G ( N , p ) model is usually preferred because it allows for easier calculations of network properties [ 21 , 42 , 185 ] and as such is the de facto version of the ER model . Finally , one can show that in the large network limit , both ensembles are equivalent [ 14 , 225 ] , i . e . when N → ∞ , most networks in the G ( N , p ) ensemble have a number of links close to the expected number of links . The ER model readily admits an extension to directed networks—the G ( N , L ) model is exactly the same , but the links are directed , while the G ( N , p ) model realizes N ( N − 1 ) possible links with probability p as there are twice as many directed links possible compared to the undirected case . We now describe some properties of the ER model that we will make use of in Chapter 5 . Detailed derivations of these results can be found in any introductory book on network science such as Newman [ 185 ] or Barabási and Pósfai [ 21 ] . Probability of a network . As already discussed , the probability of generating a speciﬁc network in the G ( N , L ) model is uniform in the total number of networks Ω N , L with N nodes and L links , and zero otherwise . By contrast , in the G ( N , p ) CHAPTER 2 . BACKGROUND 18 model any simple network can be generated with probability p L ( 1 − p ) ( N 2 ) − L . Mean degree . In the G ( N , L ) model , the mean degree is just (cid:104) k (cid:105) = 2 LN and is in fact the same for all network realizations . In the G ( N , p ) model , the expected number of links is (cid:104) L (cid:105) = p (cid:0) N 2 (cid:1) so that the mean degree is (cid:104) k (cid:105) = 2 (cid:104) L (cid:105) N = p ( N − 1 ) . Degree distribution . In the G ( N , p ) model the degree distribution is a binomial : p k = (cid:18) N − 1 k (cid:19) p k ( 1 − p ) N − 1 − k . ( 2 . 18 ) In many cases the G ( N , p ) model is studied in the limit of large networks , i . e . as N → ∞ , since some of the analytical calculations become exact only in this limit . Typically the so called sparse limit is considered [ 185 , p . 134 ] in which the mean degree (cid:104) k (cid:105) is ﬁxed . In this limit the degree distribution is Poisson : p k = e −(cid:104) k (cid:105) (cid:104) k (cid:105) k k ! . ( 2 . 19 ) Because of this result , ER networks are sometimes called Poisson random graphs . This result is also the ﬁrst to suggest that the ER model is inadequate for modelling real world networks because the degree distributions are rarely as homogeneous as a Poisson distribution and much more often feature heavy tails , often manifested as a power law degree distribution [ 20 , 180 ] . Clustering coeﬃcient . Because in the G ( N , p ) model all links are independently realized with probability p , the clustering coeﬃcient takes the same value C = p = (cid:104) k (cid:105) N − 1 . Thus , in the sparse limit the clustering coeﬃcient vanishes and there are almost no triangles in a typical network . In fact , one can calculate the expected number of loops of any ﬁxed size which turns out to be independent of network size [ 39 ] . This means that ER networks are locally tree - like —lacking in short loops as observed in many real networks . This constitutes a second major shortcoming of ER networks as a model for real networks . Giant component . Consider the two limiting cases of the G ( N , p ) model : for p = 0 , there are no links in the network and it is completely disconnected while for p = 1 , all of the possible (cid:0) N 2 (cid:1) links are present , the network is connected and is in fact the complete graph on N nodes . The largest connected component in each case is of size 1 and N respectively . However , if we increase N , in the ﬁrst case for p = 0 , the largest component is always of the same size 1 , independent of network size , CHAPTER 2 . BACKGROUND 19 while in the p = 1 case it is linear in N . Such a connected component that grows linearly with network size is called a giant component . One of the most interesting properties of the ER model is that a giant com - ponent emerges spontaneously as we increase the connection probability p or equiv - alently the mean degree (cid:104) k (cid:105) in the sparse limit case . There exists a critical value of connection probability p c ( equivalently , a critical mean degree (cid:104) k (cid:105) c ) at which the largest component stops being of ﬁxed size and independent of N and becomes extensive —grows linearly with N . This phenomenon is called a phase transition and is ubiquitous in the natural sciences [ 226 ] and statistical mechanics [ 221 ] , examples of which include the water - ice transition and the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic tran - sition in magnetic materials , both manifesting under changing temperature . In the case of random networks , the connection probability p or the mean degree (cid:104) k (cid:105) are analogous to temperature . It turns out that for the ER model , the transition to a giant component in the sparse limit occurs at (cid:104) k (cid:105) c = 1 , that is , a giant component that grows linearly with N is present when the average degree of the network is at least one . Moreover , it is the only giant component as the second largest component only grows logarithmically with N [ e . g . see 48 , Ch . 6 , or 83 , Ch . 2 ] , so most of the time we talk about the giant component . The emergence of the giant component is an example of phenomena studied in percolation theory [ 2 ] . It is important to note that the presence of a giant component is not the same as the whole network becoming connected . Indeed , a giant component can exist and only encompass a minority of nodes if the mean degree is only slightly larger than one . In ﬁg . 2 . 6 we show the evolution of the size of the giant component in the G ( N , p ) model in the sparse limit both analytically and via numerical simulation . We observe that there is no giant component present for any value of mean degree (cid:104) k (cid:105) < 1 , while for (cid:104) k (cid:105) > 1 a giant component exists and occupies a ﬁxed fraction of nodes in the network . Note , however , that for the network to become fully connected , the mean degree must be much larger than the critical degree (cid:104) k (cid:105) c = 1 . The emergence of a giant component in random network models with clus - tering will be our main focus in Chapter 5 . 2 . 3 . 2 Conﬁguration model While the ER model was instrumental in launching the study of random networks , its application to modelling real network structures was quickly realized to be lim - ited because many of its properties were not exhibited by real networks . Perhaps the most important roadblock to its success is that it produce networks with homo - CHAPTER 2 .

To remedy this shortcoming , random network models with arbitrary degree distributions have been proposed , the most popular of which is the conﬁguration model , sometimes also called the generalized random graph model as it is a generalization of the ER model . The conﬁguration model dates back to Bender and Canﬁeld [ 32 ] and Bollobás [ 49 ] who deﬁne a random network ensemble with a ﬁxed degree sequence . The idea is to ﬁx the number of nodes N and the degree sequence k = { k 1 , k 2 , . . . , k N } , and to construct realizations of networks with the given degree sequence by assigning to each node a number of half - edges or stubs equal to its degree and forming edges by randomly pairing the half - edges . This procedure generates a network with exactly the desired degree sequence . Importantly , this construction generates each network with degree sequence k with uniform probability [ 174 ] which is crucial for accurately calculating properties of the network ensemble in expected value . Of course , not every integer sequence is a degree sequence—it has to satisfy some constraints to be able to generate a network , i . e . it has to be graphic . One trivial condition is the handshake lemma we already introduced in Section 2 . 2 : N (cid:88) i = 1 k i = 2 L , ( 2 . 20 ) where L is the number of links . But this is not the only requirement for a degree CHAPTER 2 . BACKGROUND 21 sequence to be graphic , a necessary and suﬃcient condition is given by the Erdős - Gallai theorem [ 101 ] . A popular algorithm for deciding whether a given degree sequence is graphic is the Havel - Hakimi algorithim [ 111 , 114 ] . An improvement providing a linear time algorithm has recently been proposed [ 74 ] . The CM has some caveats , most importantly , because of the random match - ing of half - edges , it is prone to creating both self - edges and multiple connections leading to networks that are not simple . One might be tempted to reject any poten - tial matchings of half - edges that would result in a self - edge or multi - edge , but doing so would violate the uniform sampling property and thus invalidate the analytical calculation of network properties [ 185 ] . Two other approaches to dealing with these shortcomings have been proposed—erasing any self - edges and multi - edges after the network construction or rejecting any completed networks that have these from the ensemble [ 51 ] , but both methods generate slightly diﬀerent ensembles with diﬀerent network properties . In practice it is preferable to allow the creation of these unin - tended artefacts even if the real network systems that are being modelled do not have these features , the reason being that for a large class of degree sequences ( i . e . those obeying the so called structural cutoﬀ for which the maximum degree k max is no larger than ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) N ) 1 / 2 [ 45 ] ) both the number of self - edges and multi - edges created during the CM process is ﬁxed and independent of network size meaning that for large networks these constitute a negligible fraction of all links and can be safely ignored [ 185 , p . 436 ] . These caveats have been resolved by a direct network construction method from a given degree sequence that has recently been proposed [ 41 , 74 ] . This method generates biased samples of simple networks from the CM with appropriate weights , enabling the calculation of average properties in the network ensemble . This tech - nique has also been extended to directed networks [ 140 ] and networks with prescribed degree correlations [ 27 ] . A slightly diﬀerent deﬁnition of the CM was introduced by Newman et al . [ 183 ] who , instead of ﬁxing the degree sequence k of the ensemble at the outset , prescribe drawing a valid degree sequence from a ﬁxed degree distribution p k for each new network realization . This means that the degree sequence will be diﬀerent from network to network , but the resulting ensemble of networks will have the same degree distribution on average . The two diﬀerent ensembles are sometimes referred to as the microcanonical ensemble ( with hard constraints ) and the canonical ensemble ( with soft constraints ) in analogy to the two maximum entropy ensembles in statistical physics in which either all possible states with a ﬁxed energy E are considered ( microcanonical ) or CHAPTER 2 . BACKGROUND 22 the states can have diﬀerent energies as long as the average energy (cid:104) E (cid:105) is ﬁxed ( canonical ) [ 221 ] . The existence of two distinct CM ensembles also parallels the two distinct ER models—the ﬁxed link model G ( N , L ) and the average ﬁxed link model G ( N , p ) , and the correspondence to the microcanonical and canonical ensembles of the ER models is the same . Interestingly , while the two ER models are equivalent in the thermodynamic N → ∞ limit , the two CM ensembles are not equivalent even in the N → ∞ limit due to the fact that the number of constraints in this case grows linearly with N unlike in the ER case [ 14 , 225 ] . This motivates the need for a principled choice of exactly which model to use in applications as results obtained from either ensemble may diﬀer signiﬁcantly . The CM model can also be generalized to directed networks . In this case , instead of specifying the degree sequence k = { k 1 , k 2 , . . . , k N } , we specify the bi - degree sequence of pairs of in - degrees and out - degrees : k = { ( k in 1 , k out 1 ) , ( k in 2 , k out 2 ) , . . . , ( k in N , k out N ) } [ 90 , 140 ] . As with the undirected version , one can consider instead the canonical ensemble by specifying the bivariate joint degree distribution p kl . Link probability Unlike in the ER model in which each link has the same prob - ability p of being realized , the CM model has heterogeneous link probabilities which depend on the degree sequence . For a large class of degree distributions which are not heavy tailed [ 15 , 36 , 185 ] , in the CM model the probability of creating a link between nodes i and j is given by p ij = k i k j (cid:104) k (cid:105) N . ( 2 . 21 ) This expression , however , is generally not valid for heavy - tailed degree distributions such as the power - law . In such cases , the expressions for p ij take a more complicated form involving “hidden variables” [ 46 , 60 ] related to Lagrange multipliers arising from the constrained maximisation problem when solving for p ij [ 15 , 224 ] . This slightly more complex situation corresponds to natural correlations arising in the CM for heavy - tailed degree distributions which are not present for more homogeneous degree distributions [ 36 , 46 , 129 ] . The link probabilities p ij allows one to calculate the probability of generating any particular network structure as in the case of the ER model , although the precise expression is more involved [ 15 ] . Clustering coeﬃcient . The clustering coeﬃcient in the CM is given by C = 1 N (cid:0) (cid:104) k 2 (cid:105) − (cid:104) k (cid:105) (cid:1) 2 (cid:104) k (cid:105) 3 . ( 2 . 22 ) CHAPTER 2 . BACKGROUND 23 Thus , clustering only depends on the ﬁrst two moments of the degree distribution . Like in the ER model , the clustering coeﬃcient scales as N − 1 and vanishes in the large network limit , however , an important diﬀerence is that this more general ex - pression involves the second moment of the degree distribution (cid:104) k 2 (cid:105) in the numerator which can be large in highly skewed degree distributions like the power law p k ∼ k − γ for γ ∈ ( 2 , 3 ) and thus make the clustering coeﬃcient non - negligible in ﬁnite networks [ 66 ] . Giant component . The emergence of the giant component in the CM was ﬁrst studied by Molloy and Reed [ 174 , 175 ] who showed that the CM has a giant compo - nent if and only if (cid:104) k 2 (cid:105) − 2 (cid:104) k (cid:105) > 0 . ( 2 . 23 ) This condition , now commonly known as the Molloy - Reed condition , thus general - izes the corresponding result for the ER model and , like the clustering coeﬃcient , only depends on the ﬁrst two moments of the degree distribution . Because of the appearance of the second moment of the degree distribution , as in the case of the clustering coeﬃcient , for power law degree distributions with the exponent γ < 3 a giant component is always present . This fact has been used to show that power - law networks are exceptionally resilient to random failures of nodes [ 64 ] but at the same time susceptible to targeted attacks [ 65 ] as well as large scale invasions by infectious diseases [ 181 , 192 , 193 ] . 2 . 3 . 3 Other important models We brieﬂy mention a few other inﬂuential random network models that will not be the subject of this thesis . The small - world network model , also known as the Watts - Strogatz ( WS ) model is a model of networks that exhibits both the small - world property—the typ - ical average distance between nodes is logarithmic in the network size—and high clustering [ 248 ] . It is based on a probabilistic rewiring procedure of edges and inter - polates between a regular ring lattice and an Erdős - Rényi random graph . The main limitation of this model is the homogeneous degree distribution . The preferential attachment model , also know as the Barabási - Albert ( BA ) model is a growing network model formulated to explain the formation of the World Wide Web [ 20 ] . The “growth” part refers to new nodes arriving in the system while “preferential attachment” ensures that they get preferentially linked with existing CHAPTER 2 . BACKGROUND 24 high - degree nodes . The main appeal of this model is that it produces a true scale - free degree distribution p k ∝ k − 3 , however its clustering coeﬃcient still vanishes with system size as C ∝ N − 0 . 75 albeit slower than in the ER random graph . The BA model has also been extended to be able to generate scale - free degree distribu - tions with any exponent in the range ( − 2 , ∞ ) [ 144 , 145 ] . It has also been modiﬁed to include intrinsic node ﬁtness that inﬂuences the preferential attachment beyond just the node degree , this is known as the Bianconi – Barabási model [ 38 ] and can account for degree correlations in modelling the Internet . It also exhibits interesting condensation transitions [ 37 ] . The stochastic block model [ 118 ] is a network model for producing networks with community structure—subsets of nodes characterized by denser connections between them than with other “external” nodes [ 108 ] . This model is basically an ex - tension of the ER model in that it partitions the nodes into sets of disjoint partitions ( communities ) and assigns links between nodes in communities and links between nodes from diﬀerent communities with altered probabilities . Various extensions have been proposed to account for more realistic network structures : overlapping com - munities [ 4 ] , degree heterogeneity [ 134 ] , directed networks and multigraphs [ 197 ] , and weighted networks [ 3 ] to name a few . Networks with community structure and community detection in empirical networks is a vast subject area in network science , comprehensive reviews of the subject include Fortunato [ 96 ] , Fortunato and Hric [ 97 ] . Spatial networks or geometric graphs are models of networks in which nodes are explicitly embedded in some underlying coordinate space and links between nodes are made via some distance metric . The study of spatial networks goes back to Gilbert [ 106 ] and has attracted a lot of attention in the following decades [ 24 , 199 ] . Spatial networks are attractive to model real systems in which the underlying space is relevant , examples include transportation networks [ 152 ] , Internet [ 252 ] , power grids ( ﬁg . 2 . 5 ) [ 5 ] , neural networks in the brain [ 52 ] and many others . Exponential random graphs are a class of generative network models that ap - ply Jayne’s principle of maximum entropy [ 126 , 127 ] to generate maximally random networks with pre - deﬁned constraints . This method borrows heavily from statistical mechanics in that it treats a realization of a speciﬁc network as a microstate of the statistical ensemble of all random networks with the desired macroscopic properties ( enforced by constraints ) . Random networks are obtained by maximising the Gibbs entropy [ 70 ] of the probability distribution of graphs subject to constraints of inter - est ( e . g . number of triangles / clustering [ 53 , 191 , 230 ] , degree sequence [ 14 , 15 , 36 ] , degree correlations [ 34 ] , community structure [ 100 ] ) . This method is very ﬂexible CHAPTER 2 . BACKGROUND 25 because almost any network structure can be encoded as a constrained optimization problem . The drawback is that the models get analytically intractable very quickly when the constraint go beyond very simple [ 190 ] and even sampling the ensemble via Markov Chain Monte Carlo can yield unsatisfactory results [ 121 , 191 ] . These types of random network models have been particularly popular in social sciences where they are also known as p ∗ models [ 213 , 214 ] . CHAPTER 3 NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING Food webs are abstract representations of which species consume which others in an ecosystem [ 62 , 87 , 189 , 201 ] . In a network - based description , species are represented by nodes and their trophic interactions are represented by directed links , pointing from prey to predator [ 81 , 82 , 201 ] . In practice , food webs are inferred by ﬁeld ecologists , typically by studying species gut content or by direct observation of animal diet ( e . g . see [ 163 ] for a description of the resolution of Little Rock Lake food web ) . Figure 3 . 1 is an example of such a food web and illustrates why directed networks are the natural theoretical abstraction for the study of their properties . Much work has been devoted to understanding the origin and meaning of the particular feeding patterns observed in various ecosystems [ 103 , 167 , 202 ] . Faced with the complexity of whole food webs , many researchers have focused on the interactions among subsets of species , through the analysis of small , connected subgraphs , or motifs [ 25 , 50 , 56 , 196 , 229 ] . However , the emergence of these motifs corresponding to speciﬁc preying behaviours is still not well understood . In this chapter we study the structure of 46 empirical food webs in the context of a new food web metric and accompanying model which allows us to classify food webs into two broad families according to their motif structure . 3 . 1 Background 3 . 1 . 1 Trophic coherence Consider a directed network of N nodes characterized by the N × N adjacency matrix A with elements a ij = 1 if there is a directed link from i to j and a ij = 0 26 CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 27 Figure 3 . 1 : A subset of the Chesapeake Bay food web focusing on trophic interactions between water birds [ 200 ] . CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 28 otherwise . The in - degree and the out - degree of node j are deﬁned as k in j = (cid:80) i a ij and k out j = (cid:80) i a ji respectively . We shall assume that our network is weakly connected— there is only one weakly connected component—and that there is a positive number of nodes B > 0 with k in = 0 which we will call basal nodes . It is standard in ecology [ 131 , 154 ] to deﬁne the trophic level s j of node j as s j = 1 + 1 k in j (cid:88) i a ij s i ( 3 . 1 ) if k in j > 0 or s j = 1 if k in j = 0 . In other words , the trophic level of basal nodes ( autotrophs in the ecological context ) is set to be s = 1 by convention while the other nodes ( consumer species ) are assigned the average trophic level of their in - neighbours ( prey , resources ) , plus one . Equation ( 3 . 1 ) deﬁnes a linear system which can be solved for s j to assign a trophic level to every node in the network . In order to do this , two conditions must hold . First , there must be at least one basal node , B > 0 which we have assumed is the case ; and second , every node in the network must be reachable by a path from at least one basal node . Note that food webs in particular always satisfy both conditions so that a unique solution for trophic levels exists . Next , following Johnson et al . [ 131 ] , we associate a trophic distance to each link ij by x ij = s j − s i . 1 Then consider the distribution of trophic distances p ( x ) as measured on a network . By eq . ( 3 . 1 ) , this always has mean (cid:104) x (cid:105) = 1 and standard deviation q = (cid:112) (cid:104) x 2 (cid:105) − 1 which we will call the trophic incoherence parameter . The trophic incoherence parameter is thus a measure of the homogeneity of the trophic distance distribution p ( x ) : the more similar the trophic distances of all links , the more coherent the network . For perfectly coherent networks we have q = 0 which translates to having only integer valued trophic levels . In the context of ecology , this would characterize a food web in which species feed on prey only one trophic level below their own and there are distinct groups of “herbivores” feeding only on basal species , “predators” feeding only on “herbivores” and so on . For less coherent networks , q > 0 indicates a less ordered trophic structure where the trophic levels can have fractional values and species tend to prey on a broader range of trophic levels . Thus trophic coherence can be seen as an average measure of trophic specialization of consumer species in a food web . Figure 3 . 2 shows two examples of food webs with vastly diﬀerent trophic structures : Crystal Lake ( Delta ) [ 239 ] , a highly coherent network with q = 0 . 17 and Coachella Valley [ 204 ] , a highly incoherent terrestrial food web with q = 1 . 21 . 1 This is not a distance in the mathematical sense since it can assume negative values . CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 29 5 1 4 3 2 Figure 3 . 2 : Examples of diﬀerent degrees of trophic coherence in food webs . Left : Crystal Lake ( Delta ) [ 239 ] —a highly coherent network with q = 0 . 17 , note that only one link prevents the network from being perfectly coherent ( q = 0 ) . Right : Coachella Valley [ 204 ] —an incoherent network with q = 1 . 21 , note the high number of nodes falling between integer trophic levels due to the complex patterns of trophic links . Trophic coherence as measured by q has been shown to be the best statistical predictor of linear stability as well as a number of structural properties of empirical food webs [ 76 , 131 ] . It has also been related to the cycle structure and distribution of eigenvalues in directed networks [ 128 ] . 3 . 1 . 2 Food web motifs Faced with the complexities of studying large networked systems , scientists have sought to gain insight by looking at the role of smaller local modules or subgraphs embedded within the whole network structure [ 123 ] , sometimes termed “building blocks” of networks [ 171 ] . There is a large scientiﬁc interest in studying the sub - graph composition of both empirical networks [ 143 , 206 ] and popular network models [ 18 , 99 , 123 ] , studying correlations between subgraph counts and global network mea - sures [ 243 ] , and formulating network models that can prescribe diﬀerent subgraph frequencies in a bid to uncover a new class of null models [ 95 , 133 , 156 , 211 , 212 ] . Because the number of possible non - isomorphic graphs on n vertices grows very quickly even for small n , it is customary to study the smallest possible sub - graphs that would give rise to non - trivial behaviour . In particular , as we are study - ing directed networks , we will be focusing on the three - node connected subgraphs ( henceforth triads ) of which there are exactly 13 distinct ones ( ﬁg . 3 . 3 ) . Subgraphs such as these have received a lot of attention in food web modelling because many of these triads admit a straightforward ecological interpretation [ 229 ] . CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 30 a b Figure 3 . 3 : The 13 unique connected triads on directed networks . These can be separated into two groups : ( a ) ﬁve triads , S1 – S5 , that only contain single links , ( b ) eight triads , D1 – D8 , that have double links ( corresponding to mutual predation ) . The eight triads D1 – D8 feature double links which correspond to mutual predation between two species . The ﬁve single link triads S1 – S5 consist of some of the more basic building blocks of food webs . The triad S1 is a simple food chain [ 25 , 62 ] , S2 represents omnivory ( a predator preying on two species at diﬀerent trophic levels ) [ 25 , 204 ] , triad S3 is a cycle ( a relatively rare feature ) [ 204 , 229 ] , and triads S4 – S5 represent a predator preying on two species ( apparent competition ) and two predators sharing a prey species ( direct competition ) , respectively [ 50 ] . One of the most successful methods for gaining insight into the origin and function of small substructures has been to study their relative prevalence in an empirically observed network against some null model of a synthetic network which incorporates some ground hypothesis about the formation process of the empirical network [ 171 , 173 ] . Applying this technique to food webs , ecologists have developed several competing hypotheses for the relative prevalence of the three - node triads . The prevailing hypotheses are that these triads emerge as a result of physical con - straints ( e . g . species body size , abstracted by the “niche dimension” ) in the assembly of food webs [ 56 , 229 ] , that functional importance leads to the observed structural patterns [ 206 ] , or that certain stability properties favour some subgraphs over others [ 50 ] . Attempts to explain subgraph patterns using the two most established food web models , the generalized cascade model [ 228 ] and the generalized niche model [ 250 ] , have been unsatisfactory since either model produces food webs with rigid three - species subgraph patterns [ 56 , 229 ] while real food - webs display a far richer array of local preying patterns [ 50 , 229 ] . To remedy this disagreement between theory and observation , we study a new food - web model , the Generalized Preferential Preying Model ( GPPM ) [ 131 ] which takes into account the trophic coherence of networks and can accurately predict the three - species subgraph patterns across a wide array of distinct types of food - webs . CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 31 3 . 1 . 3 Food web models We brieﬂy describe the two most widely used structural food web models—the Gen - eralized Cascade Model and the Generalized Niche Model—before introducing the starting point of modelling food webs with trophic structure via the Preferential Preying Model . Cascade Model and Generalized Cascade Model The original Cascade Model [ 61 ] assigns a a random number n i to each species i from the uniform distribution on [ 0 , 1 ] . Then for all pairs ( i , j ) , i is set to be the consumer of j with some constant probability p if n i > n j and with probability zero otherwise . If the number of species is set to be N and the expected number of links to L , the constant probability takes the form p = 2 L N ( N − 1 ) . ( 3 . 2 ) The Cascade Model thus assumes a “pecking order” of species and a rule under which no species can consume prey higher than itself in the order . On the other hand , the probability of a species preying on a lower - ranked species is constant regardless of how far down the hierarchy the potential prey exists . This was the ﬁrst attempt to show that networks similar to real food webs could be generated via simple rules and imposing a hierarchy of species . The model was later modiﬁed so that the number of prey would be instead drawn from a Beta distribution as in the Niche Model [ 250 ] and the new model was called the Generalized Cascade Model [ 227 ] . This amendment improved the model’s predictions with respect to the distribution of prey and predators ( i . e . the empirically observed degree distributions ) . Niche Model and Generalized Niche Model As in the Cascade Model , in the Niche Model [ 250 ] each species i is awarded a uniform random number in [ 0 , 1 ) called the niche value , but the model reﬁnes the Cascade Model by constraining a species i diet to a subset of species j with lower niche value . Speciﬁcally , species i is constrained to consume species j such that c i − r i / 2 ≤ n j < c i + r i / 2 , i . e . all species within an interval of size r i centred at c i and no others . The range parameter is deﬁned as r i = x i n i where x i is drawn from the Beta distribution with parameters ( 1 , β ) . For a ﬁxed number of species N and an expected number of links L , the parameter β takes the form CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 32 β = N ( N − 1 ) 2 L − 1 . ( 3 . 3 ) The centres of the intervals c i are drawn from the uniform distribution on [ r i / 2 , n i ] . The Niche Model is an improvement on the Cascade Model by allowing for cannibalism as well as looping—propensity to consume prey above a species trophic niche . The motivation behind the Niche Model is the so called intervality hypoth - esis —that there is an intrinsic ordering of species such that the prey of any given predator are contiguous [ 63 ] . Recent work has shown that food webs are biased to - wards intervality [ 228 ] , although they are generally not perfectly interval , especially if species body size is taken as a proxy for niche value [ 57 ] . Nevertheless , the Niche Model has been very successful as it outperforms the Cascade Model in predicting many structural features of food webs [ 250 ] . The Niche Model was later modiﬁed to account for the fact that real food webs are not maximally interval by introducing an additional contiguity parameter c which determines the proportion of prey to be allocated according to the original Niche Model prescription and the rest according to the Generalized Cascade Model [ 228 ] . This modiﬁed model is known as the Generalized Niche Model and is implemented as the original Niche Model , but with reduced ranges r i = cx i n i . Then for each species a number of extra prey k cascade i = ( 1 − c ) x i n i N is drawn randomly from all the available species with niche values lower than n i as in the Generalized Cascade Model . Thus , the Generalized Niche Model interpolates between the Niche Model ( c = 1 ) and the Generalized Cascade Model ( c = 0 ) . Preferential Preying Model ( PPM ) The Preferential Preying Model ( PPM ) was introduced by Johnson et al . [ 131 ] as the ﬁrst food web model to explicitly model trophic coherence in food webs . It is a growing network model , inspired by the Barabási - Albert model of preferential attachment [ 20 ] , but in the context of a growing ecosystem through immigration of new species . The model starts with B nodes ( basal species ) with trophic levels s = 1 and no links . New nodes are then added sequentially until the total number of nodes reaches N . Every new node i is ﬁrst awarded a random prey node j from all the existing nodes in the network and assigned a temporary trophic level ˆ s i = 1 + s j . Following this , another κ i prey nodes l are chosen with a probability that decays with the tentative trophic distance ˆ x il = s l − ˆ s i , speciﬁcally : P il ∝ exp (cid:18) − | ˆ x il − 1 | T (cid:19) , ( 3 . 4 ) CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 33 where T is a “temperature” parameter that tunes the trophic coherence : for T = 0 , perfectly coherent networks are generated ( q = 0 ) , while q increases monotonically for T > 0 . The number of prey κ i in the original PPM is obtained similarly to the Niche Model method [ 227 ] by setting κ i = x i n i , where n i is the number of nodes in the network when node i arrives and x i is a Beta random variable with parameters ( 1 , β ) such that β = N 2 − B 2 2 L − 1 , ( 3 . 5 ) where L is the expected number of links in the resulting network . This way the Generalized Cascade Model is recovered in the T → ∞ limit while the degree distri - butions are as in the Generalized Niche Model . Even though the PPM captures many empirically observed patterns in food webs , it suﬀers from a major drawback , namely it can only generate acyclic networks . While this is a property that is shared by many food webs , it is far from universal [ 56 ] and , in particular , makes the PPM unsuitable for studying mutual predation or food web motifs . To remedy this , we now describe an extension of the PPM that can generate cycles . 3 . 2 Generalized Preferential Preying Model ( GPPM ) In this section we extend the PPM model introduced by Johnson et al . [ 131 ] in a way that allows bidirectional links ( corresponding to mutual predation ) and cycles of higher order to form thus producing more realistic networks . Again , we denote by B , N and L the number of basal nodes ( autotrophs ) , the number of total nodes and the number of links in the network respectively as input parameters . The network construction begins with B basal nodes and no links . We assign trophic level s = 1 for all basal nodes . We then proceed to introduce N − B new , non - basal nodes in the network sequentially . For each such new node j , we pick exactly one prey node or in - neighbour i at random from among all the existing node in the network thus creating a link from i to j . In doing so , we assign a temporary trophic level to node j as ˆ s j = 1 + ˆ s i . After this procedure ﬁnishes , we have a network of N nodes , N − B links and each node i has a temporary trophic level ˆ s i that is an integer ( since every non - basal node has only one in - neighbour at this point ) . Finally , we add the remaining links to the network to bring the total number of links up to L ( in expected value ) . For this , we choose links to be placed among CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 34 all possible pairs of disconnected nodes ( i , j ) where j is not a basal node 2 with a probability P ij that decays with the tentative trophic distance ˆ x ij = ˆ s j − ˆ s i between them . Speciﬁcally , we set P ij ∝ exp (cid:32) − ( ˆ x ij − 1 ) 2 2 T 2 (cid:33) . ( 3 . 6 ) As in the original PPM , the “temperature” parameter T sets the amount of deviation from a perfectly coherent network and the probabilities are normalized so that the expected number of links in the ﬁnal network is L . 3 At the end of the network creation process the trophic levels need to be recalculated according to eq . ( 3 . 1 ) as the addition of new links will have changed the network topology , and the trophic levels in the ﬁnal network need not correspond to the temporary integer valued trophic levels . 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 Temperature T 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 1 . 25 I n c o h e r e n ce q B = 10 B = 25 B = 50 Figure 3 . 4 : Dependence of the incoherence parameter q on the temperature param - eter T .

The model exhibits a monotonic dependence of q on T which provides a basis for ﬁtting the model to empirical food webs given the empirically observed value of q . We also note that the level of incoherence that is achieved at any given 2 This ensures no incoming links to basal nodes which would make them non - basal . 3 In principle , the link addition process can be amended so that the ﬁnal number of links is exactly L not just on average . However , this can be detrimental because in some situations , e . g . for low T and high link density , the exact number of links L may not be attainable without distorting the probability distribution set by eq . ( 3 . 6 ) . CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 35 temperature depends on B / N , the ratio of basal species to all species . Before ﬁtting the model to empirical data , we explore some interesting properties of the GPPM in the following section . 3 . 3 Properties of the GPPM 3 . 3 . 1 Limits The GPPM has two interesting limiting behaviours as we change the temperature parameter T . As T → 0 , the probability of forming links between trophic levels more than one apart tends to zero so the model generates perfectly layered networks with q = 0 . In the other extreme , as T → ∞ , the probability of forming links between diﬀerent trophic levels becomes homogeneous and the generated networks become increasingly more random . In this limit the model generates directed Erdős - Rényi random graphs with two restrictions ( biases ) that make it diﬀerent from fully random directed ER graphs : 1 . The basal nodes are still precluded from receiving any incoming connections . 2 . The initial “skeleton” of N − B links is still present , ensuring that the network is weakly connected . This interesting deviation from the ER random graph has lead to the study of the basal network ensemble which is deﬁned as a subset of the ER random graph ensem - ble in which a number of basal nodes B is ﬁxed and cannot receive any incoming connections and for every non - basal node , the proportion of incoming links coming from basal nodes is the same . This is equivalent to ﬁxing the mean degree (cid:104) k (cid:105) in the ER ensemble and leads to highly homogeneous networks in which the distribution of trophic levels is bimodal [ 128 ] . 3 . 3 . 2 Distribution of trophic levels We can calculate the distribution of trophic levels in the GPPM model when T = 0 exactly and the mean trophic level in the limit T → ∞ which leads to an interesting crossover behaviour of the mean trophic level in coherent and incoherent networks . Let T = 0 be ﬁxed , then links can only be formed between integer valued trophic levels . Furthermore , it is only necessary to consider the ﬁrst stage of intro - ducing N − B non - basal nodes and their links because the second stage of introducing the remaining L − N + B links at T = 0 will not alter the values of the trophic levels . CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 36 As before , start with B basal nodes and consider time steps t = 0 , . . . , N − B , where at teach time step a new node is added with one incoming link chosen randomly from all the existing nodes already in the network . Let n s ( t ) be the expected number of nodes on level s at time t . Then the ﬁrst level satisﬁes n 1 ( t ) = B for all time by the deﬁnition of basal nodes . For higher trophic levels we can write d dtn s + 1 ( t ) = n s ( t ) B + t , ( 3 . 7 ) since the expected increase in the number of nodes at level s + 1 is the fraction of nodes which are at level s . Rescaling the time variable as x = ( t + B ) / B this reads d dxn s + 1 ( x ) = n s ( x ) x . ( 3 . 8 ) This equation can be solved iteratively for any level s given the initial condition n s ( x = 1 ) = n s ( t = 0 ) = 0 for all s (cid:54) = 1 . This gives the general solution n s ( x ) = B ( s − 1 ) ! log s − 1 ( x ) . ( 3 . 9 ) Using this , the distribution of trophic levels p s ( x ) is obtained by dividing n s ( x ) by the total number of nodes at time t which is B + t . Solving for t = N − B ⇒ x = N / B , we obtain the distribution of trophic levels once the network has been assembled : p s = B N 1 ( s − 1 ) ! log s − 1 (cid:18) N B (cid:19) . ( 3 . 10 ) Letting λ = log ( N / B ) we note that this is a shifted Poisson distribution with support s ∈ 1 , 2 , . . . . This gives for the mean trophic level (cid:104) s (cid:105) = log (cid:18) N B (cid:19) + 1 . ( 3 . 11 ) Thus , the mean trophic level for coherent networks is logarithmic in the ratio of total number of nodes to basal nodes . This suggests a slow growth in the mean trophic level and consequently the mean food chain length in coherent food webs as a function of the number of species . What about when T (cid:54) = 0 ? We can’t say much about the general case , but we can perform the calculation of the mean trophic level (cid:104) s ∞ (cid:105) when T → ∞ . Again consider B basal nodes and N − B non - basal nodes connected via N − B links at the end of the growth part of the model . The inﬁnite temperature limit means that we can place the remaining L − N + B links randomly between the nodes as long as we disallow incoming connections to basal nodes . For simplicity we consider the CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 37 eﬀect of the N − B initial links to have negligible impact on the ﬁnal values of the trophic level , i . e . we assume that L (cid:29) N − B . Because all links can be placed randomly between the nodes , at the end of the network creation it must be the case that each non - basal node has , on average , the same incoming degree (cid:104) k inNB (cid:105) which is made up of the same proportion of links coming from basal nodes , L B , and links coming from other non - basal nodes , L NB : (cid:104) k inNB (cid:105) = L N − B = L B + L NB N − B . ( 3 . 12 ) This together with the deﬁnition of trophic level ( eq . ( 3 . 1 ) ) allows us to write down a self - consistent equation for the mean level of non - basal nodes : (cid:104) s NB (cid:105) = 1 + L NB (cid:104) s NB (cid:105) L + L B L . ( 3 . 13 ) Rearranging we obtain (cid:104) s NB (cid:105) = L L B + 1 . ( 3 . 14 ) Thus , the mean trophic level , including basal nodes , is given by [ 128 , SI Appendix ] (cid:104) s ∞ (cid:105) = N − B N (cid:104) s NB (cid:105) + B N = L L B (cid:18) 1 − B N (cid:19) + 1 . ( 3 . 15 ) If we make the assumption that the number of links L and the number of basal links L B are proportional to N and B , respectively , ( equivalently , assuming the average outgoing degree of basal nodes is equal to that of the mean degree of the network ) , this simpliﬁes to (cid:104) s ∞ (cid:105) = N B . ( 3 . 16 ) Thus , in contrast to the coherent T = 0 case , in the random network limit , the mean trophic level is linear in the ratio of total nodes to basal nodes suggesting a much more pronounced growth in the mean food chain length in incoherent food webs as a function of the number of species . In ﬁg . 3 . 5 we plot the mean trophic level (cid:104) s (cid:105) of 46 food webs ( details to follow in Section 3 . 4 . 4 ) and compare it to the model prediction at T = 0 . We can see that the model prediction is very accurate for more coherent food webs ( low q ) while it is not performing as well for more incoherent food webs . Measuring the absolute relative error of the prediction versus the actual value , 63 % of predictions are within 10 % and 78 % of predictions are within 20 % of the observed values . Furthermore , CHAPTER 3 .

Food webs are arranged by increasing trophic incoherence parameter q . Grey bars indicate food web membership to Family 1 as uncovered by a hierarchical clustering algorithm used to compare similarity of food web motif proﬁles in Section 3 . 4 . Details of food webs can be found in Section 3 . 4 . 4 . ( b ) Relative error of the analytical prediction . ( c ) Distribution of relative errors . even in the case of more incoherent networks , the logarithmic dependence on the N / B ratio is a much better approximation than the linear dependence in the T → ∞ limit . This suggests two things : 1 . Even highly incoherent food webs ( high q ) are much less random than randomly assembled GPPM networks . 2 . For coherent networks ( low q ) the agreement between the analytical prediction of the mean trophic level and the actual empirical value suggests that species “entering” an ecosystem and choosing prey randomly is a good mechanistic approximation on how some food webs evolve . 3 . 3 . 3 Degree distribution To calculate the degree distribution of the GPPM at T = 0 , we make use of the fact that the distribution of trophic levels , p s , is a shifted Poisson distribution as derived in the previous section : p s = e − λ λ s − 1 ( s − 1 ) ! for s = 1 , 2 , 3 . . . , ( 3 . 17 ) CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 39 where λ = log ( N / B ) . Denote by N s the expected number of nodes at level s . Then B = N 0 = Np 0 . In the T = 0 case , we need to distribute a ﬁxed number of links L uniformly between any two adjacent trophic levels s , s + 1 . The total number of possible places to put links is ∞ (cid:88) s = 1 N s N s + 1 = N 2 ∞ (cid:88) s = 1 p s p s + 1 = : N 2 C , ( 3 . 18 ) so that each of these places has uniform probability L / N 2 C of being assigned a link . The expected number of links between any two adjacent levels s , s + 1 is then given by ¯ L s , s + 1 = N s N s + 1 L N 2 C = p s p s + 1 L C . ( 3 . 19 ) From here on we focus on the out - degree distribution ( the calculation for the in - degree is analogous ) . The average out - degree at level s is given by ¯ k out s = ¯ L s , s + 1 N s = p s + 1 L NC . ( 3 . 20 ) The out - degree distribution of a random node at level s is then given by a binomial distribution : P [ deg ( v s = k ) ] = (cid:18) ¯ L s , s + 1 k (cid:19) q ks ( 1 − q s ) ¯ L s , s + 1 − k , ( 3 . 21 ) where q s is the probability of attracting one of the ¯ L s , s + 1 links emanating from the N s nodes at level s : q s = 1 N s = 1 Np s . ( 3 . 22 ) Finally , the out - degree distribution for a random node in the whole network is given by a mixture of these binomial distributions where the weights are given by the shifted Poisson distribution of the node trophic levels : P [ deg ( v = k ) ] = ∞ (cid:88) s = 1 p s P [ deg ( v s = k ) ] . ( 3 . 23 ) It is unclear whether there is a closed form expression for this distribution as the mixture of binomials diﬀer not only in the probability parameter q s , but also in the “number of trials” parameter ¯ L s , s + 1 . CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 40 3 . 4 Motif analysis of food webs We now come to the main part of the chapter in which we study the eﬀect of trophic coherence on local topological features in food webs . In particular , we show that the relative prevalence of three - species motifs , corresponding to local preying patters , can be explained by the level of trophic coherence in both empirical and model food webs . This result provides another viewpoint in the debate about the origin of motif prevalences in food webs and further evidence of the importance of global organization in food webs [ 131 ] . 3 . 4 . 1 Quantifying triad signiﬁcance For any given network the exact number N k of any of the k = 1 , . . . , 13 connected triads ( ﬁg . 3 . 3 ) is inﬂuenced by the network size and the degree distribution of the vertices . To test the statistical signiﬁcance of any given triad k , the empirically observed number N k is compared against appearances of the same triad in a ran - domized ensemble of networks serving as a null model [ 173 ] . This comparison gives a statistical signiﬁcance or z - score z k = N k − (cid:104) N k (cid:105) rand σ rand , ( 3 . 24 ) where (cid:104) N k (cid:105) rand and σ rand are the randomized ensemble average and standard devi - ation for triad k , respectively . The z - score of triad k thus measures the deviation of prevalence in the observed network with respect to the null model . The z - scores of all 13 triads can be summarized in a triad signiﬁcance proﬁle ( TSP ) which is a vector z = { z k } with components z k for each triad k . Additionally , the normalized version of the TSP is often used to compare networks of diﬀerent sizes and link densities [ 173 ] . This is given by ˆz =    z k (cid:113)(cid:80) 13 k = 1 z 2 k    . ( 3 . 25 ) The randomization procedure used to obtain the randomized ensemble statis - tics is a matter of choice . A careful selection of null model is important to discern between real eﬀects and artefacts present in the TSP [ 29 ] . In our analysis , we follow the conﬁguration model ( CM ) prescription [ 183 , 185 ] , and preserve the number of incoming and outgoing links for each node ( the degree sequence ) while randomizing links via a Markov chain Monte Carlo switching algorithm [ 171 , 173 ] . This preserves both the total number of nodes ( species ) and the links ( trophic interactions ) in the CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 41 network . The generation of randomized networks and counts of triads was carried out with mﬁnder , the algorithm used by Milo et al . in their seminal work on network motifs [ 136 , 171 ] . It is important to emphasize that the TSP is a relative measure of which triads are over - and under - represented with respect to the null model provided by the randomized CM networks . The over - ( under - ) representation as indicated by a positive ( negative ) z - score indicates that these triads appear more ( less ) frequently than in the randomized networks but do not imply an absolute saturation ( absence ) of said triads . Nevertheless , the TSP is an adequate tool for comparing networks of diﬀerent sizes and degree distributions . 3 . 4 . 2 Comparing networks based on triad signiﬁcance To quantitatively compare networks based on their TSP , we use Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient r between the normalized z - score vectors ˆz a and ˆz b of networks a and b , respectively [ 173 , 229 ] . This is deﬁned as r = (cid:80) nk = 1 ( ˆ z ak − ¯ z a ) (cid:0) ˆ z bk − ¯ z b (cid:1) ( n − 1 ) σ ˆz a σ ˆz b , ( 3 . 26 ) where ¯ z a = (cid:80) nk = 1 ˆ z ak n ( 3 . 27 ) and σ ˆz a = (cid:118)(cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:116) 1 n − 1 n (cid:88) k = 1 (cid:0) ˆ z ak − ¯ z a (cid:1) 2 ( 3 . 28 ) are the mean and the standard deviation of the normalized z - score vectors , a and b specify the networks , k is an index over the triads and n = 13 is the total number of triads . With this deﬁnition a value of r close to 1 indicates that the two networks have very similar TSPs and thus patterns of over - and under - represented triads , a value close to 0 indicates no similarity , and a value close to − 1 indicates anti - similarity— i . e . triads over - represented in one network will typically be under - represented in the other ( and vice versa ) . Comparing the empirical networks is straightforward as we just calculate the r - coeﬃcient pairwise for the z - score vectors of all 46 food webs in our database . On the other hand , for comparison with the model , for each empirical network we ﬁt our food - web model to the data , generate 1000 instances of a model network and then compute the r - coeﬃcient of the empirical z - score vector and the average z - score CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 42 vector of the model - generated ensemble . 3 . 4 . 3 Clustering food webs into families To uncover clusters of food webs with similar TSPs , we use a hierarchical , agglomera - tive clustering algorithm [ 92 ] based on the Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient r between TSPs . First , we need to convert this to a distance measure . We deﬁne d = (cid:112) 2 ( 1 − r ) . ( 3 . 29 ) This deﬁnition ensures that d is a Euclidean metric [ 241 ] and we can readily apply hierarchical clustering . We use the UPGMA ( average linkage ) algorithm [ 92 ] to uncover the full cluster hierarchy . 3 . 4 . 4 Empirical food web data We study the triad signiﬁcance proﬁle ( TSP ) in 46 empirical food webs from a variety of environments : marine , freshwater ( river and lake ) and terrestrial .

NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 46 3 . 5 Results 3 . 5 . 1 Motifs in empirical food webs The main results are summarized in ﬁgs . 3 . 6 and 3 . 7 . Figure 3 . 6 shows the pairwise Pearson correlation coeﬃcients of the triad signiﬁcance proﬁles between all 46 food webs . The food webs are arranged by in - creasing incoherence parameter q so that more coherent food webs are assigned a lower ID . Red hue or warmer colours indicate a larger coeﬃcient , while blue hue or colder colours indicate an anti - correlation in the TSPs . We see that roughly two families of food webs emerge with similar TSPs . The ﬁrst family ( roughly ID 1 - 22 ) is characterized by relatively high coherence ( low incoherence parameter q ) , for which the similarities in the TSPs are very high ( r ≥ 0 . 8 ) . There is a second family of food webs , characterized by a high incoherence parameter q , that also show high similarities in their TSPs . Membership to this second family is not as clear as there is a tighter core of food webs belonging to it , with a periphery that only shares some similarities . 0 . 14 1 . 35 Incoherence q 151015202530354045 F oo d w e b I D 41381321412756191811916101721154131282522292046443635303842323326393443374540242327 Food web ID 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 1 . 25 1 . 50 D i s t a n ce d − 0 . 6 − 0 . 3 0 . 0 0 . 3 0 . 6 0 . 9 Figure 3 . 6 : Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient of the triad signiﬁcance proﬁles ( left ) and clustering of food webs into two families ( right ) .

Black crosses just below the heatmap indicate membership to Family 1 according to a clustering algorithm . Right : Dendrogram of the hierarchical clustering algorithm applied to food webs based on the distance d = (cid:112) 2 ( 1 − r ) . A threshold distance d c = 1 . 1 uncovers two large families with smaller subclusters within . To make these ideas more precise , we performed hierarchical clustering of food webs based on a distance metric derived from the pairwise Pearson correlation coeﬃcients . The resulting clusters are shown as a dendrogram in ﬁg . 3 . 6 . By choosing CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 47 a threshold distance d c , we can group food webs into a number of distinct families based on the similarities of their TSPs . Setting d c = 1 . 1 , we identify two families which include all webs . Family 1 consists of food webs with ID 1 – 22 , 25 , 28 , 29 , 31 , 36 , 41 , 44 , 46 whereas Family 2 contains webs with ID 23 , 24 , 26 , 27 , 30 , 32 - 35 , 37 - 40 , 42 , 43 , 45 . We also observe that these larger families contain within themselves smaller , even more closely related clusters ( e . g ID 1 – 22 corresponding to very low q ) . Setting a lower threshold distance could provide a more ﬁne - grained classi - ﬁcation of food webs in more than two distinct families but we now show that this coarse classiﬁcation into two families allows us to qualitatively diﬀerentiate food webs based on species preying patterns , speciﬁcally the extent of omnivory . To this end , we look closer at the bulk behaviour of the TSPs for the two families . Figure 3 . 7 shows the normalized proﬁles of Family 1 ( top ) and Family 2 ( bottom ) . Figure 3 . 7 : Triad signiﬁcance proﬁles ( TSP ) as measured by the normalized z - score of the two groups of food webs .

( b ) Food webs in the second family ( ID 23 , 24 , 26 , 27 , 30 , 32 - 35 , 37 - 40 , 42 , 43 , 45 ) with high incoherence parameter characterized by an over - representation of triad S2 . We ﬁrst consider Family 1 . The bulk behaviour of food webs in this family CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 48 is characterized by an over - representation of triads S1 , S4 and S5 , as well as an under - representation of triad S2 ( with the exception of ID 22 Michigan Lake , ID 29 Florida Bay and ID 46 Everglades Graminoid Marshes ) . We should ﬁnd the pattern of under - representation of triad S2 ( which represents omnivory ) unsurprising , since the majority of food webs belonging to this family have a low incoherence parameter q , which limits the ability of species to feed on multiple diﬀerent trophic levels . Equally , the over - representation of triads S1 , S4 and S5 is to be expected as these are the only three triads out of 13 that can arise in a hypothetical food web with q = 0 , which is a value close to the empirical values of q for food webs in this family . The double link triads D1 - D8 are all under - represented or close to even , in agreement with our expectations . We now turn to Family 2 . Here the triads S1 , S4 and S5 no longer follow a strong pattern of over - representation and the double link triads D1 - D8 are not always under - represented . The most distinguishing feature , however , is the bulk over - representation of triad S2 ( with the exception of ID 40 Weddell Sea ) , in stark contrast to Family 1 . We will argue that this is the main feature that separates the two food web families . This pattern of food webs based on the under - or over - representation of triad S2 was alluded to in previous work [ 229 ] , however it is in disagreement with the predictions of the generalized cascade [ 228 ] and niche [ 250 ] models which can only produce food webs where S2 is over - represented [ 229 ] . Subsequently , we present results from our model which show that it is possible to change the pattern of under - representation to over - representation of triad S2 by increasing the incoher - ence parameter q , thus providing evidence that trophic coherence can naturally give rise to two food web families characterized by low or high prevalence of omnivory , respectively . 3 . 5 . 2 Comparison between empirical and model networks We have also investigated the similarities of triad signiﬁcance proﬁles between the empirical food webs and model generated food webs . To this end we study the similarity of the TSPs between each empirical food web and an ensemble of model food webs ﬁtted to the data of the empirical one . The results are summarized in ﬁg . 3 . 8 . Averaging over an ensemble of 1000 model generated food webs ﬁtted to each empirical food web , we measured the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient between the TSP of the empirical food web and the TSP of the ensemble average . The results show that the model is able to reproduce empirically observed TSPs for the majority of food webs in both families with high accuracy . The model fails to produce accurate CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 49 TSPs for a number of food webs and sometimes even produces anti - correlated TSPs ( r < 0 ) . If we require that r > 0 . 5 , eight food webs are not able to be reproduced accurately by our model , ﬁve in Family 1 ( ID 31 Lough Hyne , ID 36 Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve , ID 41 Caribbean Reef , ID 44 El Verde Rainforest and ID 46 Everglades Graminoid Marshes ) and three in Family 2 ( ID 23 Bridge Broom Lake , ID 24 Grassland ( U . K . ) and ID 40 Weddell Sea ) . Recall that IDs are assigned in the order of increasing q so these particular food webs are unusual members of their respective families in that they tend to have extreme values of q with respect to the majority of networks in either family ( higher than average in Family 1 and lower than average in Family 2 ) . Because of the imperfect agreement between q and family membership , our model cannot replicate the structure of these sporadic webs . This suggests that for some food webs information about trophic coherence q may not be enough to reproduce realistic looking TSPs and there may be further mechanisms of prey selection at play [ 229 ] . 0 10 20 30 40 Food web ID 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 P e a r s o n r Pearson r Incoherence q Figure 3 . 8 : Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient of the triad signiﬁcance proﬁles ( TSP ) . The coeﬃcient is measured between the empirical TSP and the average TSP in the model ensemble over 1000 simulated networks . Food webs are arranged by increasing incoherence parameter q . The grey shading indicates membership to the ﬁrst family . 3 . 5 . 3 The role of omnivory and basal species We now focus on the claim that the main diﬀerence between the two families of food webs is the relative under - and over - representation of triad S2 , or the degree of omnivory in a food web . A prevalence of triad S2 indicates that the species in a food web often feed on diﬀerent trophic levels , contributing to an increased incoherence parameter q as discussed at the start of this section . A scarcity of triad CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 50 S2 , on the other hand , indicates that species only tend to feed on prey with similar trophic levels , which in turn signals a low incoherence parameter . This suggests a relationship between the z - score of triad S2 and network incoherence as measured by q . Furthermore , model results ( ﬁg . 3 . 4 ) suggest that a high proportion of basal species to all species , B / N , produces more coherent food webs ( i . e . with a low incoherence parameter q ) . We take this as an additional predictive food web statistic for family membership . Our ﬁndings are summarized in ﬁg . 3 . 9 . This is a scatter plot of all 46 food webs where we have plotted the ﬁtted model temperature T and the measured incoherence parameter q against the ratio of basal species to all species B / N . We observe a clear anti - correlation between q and B / N ( linear model q = a BN + b : a = − 1 . 06 , b = 0 . 77 , R 2 = 0 . 53 , p = 8 . 47 · 10 − 9 ) that indicates a positive relationship between how coherent a network is ( low q ) and how many of its species are basal . 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 Basal ratio B / N 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 T e m p e r a t u r e T 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 Basal ratio B / N 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 I n c o h e r e n ce q Under Over ˆ z S 2 Figure 3 . 9 : Scatter plots of the temperature T ( left ) and the incoherence parameter q ( right ) versus the basal species ratio B / N for all food webs . The gradient indi - cates the degree of over - representation ( red circles ) or under - representation ( blue di - amonds ) of the feed - forward triad S2 as measured by the normalized z - score ˆ z S2 . The line shows the transition from over - representation ( above ) to under - representation ( below ) as observed in the model with N = 100 , (cid:104) k (cid:105) = L / ( N − B ) = 10 averaged over 100 runs . Error bars are approximate 95 % conﬁdence intervals . We have also coloured the markers of each food web to indicate the level of over - or under - representation of triad S2 as measured by the normalized z - score ˆ z S2 . Red circles indicate an over - representation while blue diamonds indicate an under - representation of S2 in the respective food web . Remarkably , based on this measure , we uncover two clusters of food webs corresponding roughly to the two families based on TSP similarities . The ﬁrst cluster is once again characterized by a high incoherence parameter q as well as a low ratio of basal species to all species CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 51 B / N . The second cluster is characterized by a low incoherence parameter and a high ratio of basal species to all species . The only exceptions are six food webs in the ﬁrst family ( ID 20 Coweeta ( 1 ) , ID 21 Martins Stream , ID 31 Lough Hyne , ID 36 Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve , ID 41 Caribbean Reef and ID 44 El Verde Rainforest ) , four of which correspond to food webs poorly matched by our model ( ﬁg . 3 . 8 ) . We conclude that , indeed , the main diﬀerence between the two families is the relative role of triad S2 as already observed in the bulk behaviour of the TSPs in ﬁg . 3 . 7 . Finally , we study whether our model exhibits a similar transition from a rela - tively S2 - poor to an S2 - rich state which would explain the relatively good agreement between empirical and model generated TSPs for the two families ( ﬁg . 3 . 8 ) . We ﬁnd that for a given basal species ratio B / N there exists a critical temperature T c , and thus a critical incoherence parameter q c , which signiﬁes such a transition . For T ( and q ) below these critical values , the model generates networks where S2 is under - represented , while for values above critical , the networks generated have either an even or an over - represented number of S2 triads . We include the transition line of the two regimes in ﬁg . 3 . 9 for an ensemble of 100 model networks with N = 100 species and an average ( non - basal ) degree (cid:104) k (cid:105) = L / ( N − B ) = 10 . Networks with q below the line show an under - representation of S2 triads , while networks with q above the line show an over - representation as measured by ˆ z S2 . Remarkably , the model results are in very good agreement with the empirical data despite the fact that both the network size N and the average degree (cid:104) k (cid:105) vary considerably between the empirical food webs . Almost all food webs with an under - represented number of S2 triads fall below the transition line of the model while those with an over - represented number reside above the line . These ﬁndings suggest that the two families of food webs diﬀer in the degree of omnivory present as measured by the prevalence of triad S2 which is itself intimately related to the incoherence parameter q . Interestingly , based on the strong anti - correlation between q and B / N , either parameter is a strong determinant of family membership . To our knowledge , the GPPM is the ﬁrst food - web model able to reproduce triad signiﬁcance proﬁles consistent with empirical observations . The ability to produce model networks belonging to either of the two families suggests that the parameters q and B / N are both important in the mathematical modelling of food webs and may , in fact , be fundamental for understanding local preying patterns in food webs . CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 52 3 . 6 Discussion Our investigation of trophic interaction patterns in food webs has revealed signiﬁcant correlations between the degree of omnivory , hierarchical organization of trophic species and the density of basal species . The analysis of local trophic interactions via triad signiﬁcance proﬁles in empirical food webs reveals two distinct families of food webs characterized by a relatively low or high incoherence parameter respectively . While certain diﬀerences across families of food webs based on their TSPs have been observed before [ 229 ] , these are not predicted by any existing food web models , calling into question their use as null models given the academic signiﬁcance attached to food web motifs [ 25 , 50 , 56 , 196 , 229 ] . Trophic coherence provides a network theoretic metric that enables us to classify and predict the relative prevalence of such motifs . We have shown qualitatively that the the main diﬀerence between the two food web families is the extent of omnivory , as measured by the over - or under - representation of triad S2 ( the “feed - forward loop” ) . This classiﬁcation of food webs into two families according to the extent of omnivory is at odds with previous claims that omnivory occurs more often than one would expect to happen by chance across most food webs [ 229 ] . On the other hand , the existence of these families may be related to diﬀerent ways omnivory emerges in food webs and inﬂuences their stability [ 10 , 131 , 177 ] . We have tested our prediction for the onset of omnivory using a new model for generating synthetic food webs with a given trophic coherence . We ﬁnd that the model exhibits a transition from an under - representation of omnivory to an over - representation of omnivory as a function of trophic coherence . Our model results ﬁt the food web data very well , providing evidence of the importance of trophic coherence as well as the basal species density in modelling realistic trophic interactions . We would like to emphasize that these ﬁndings are remarkably robust between food webs originating from vastly diﬀerent habitats . This work has expanded on the importance of trophic coherence in predicting structural features in food webs [ 131 ] , but the biological origin of trophic coherence remains elusive . Basal species density and its eﬀect of suppressing highly incoherent structures in both empirical and model food webs may provide some clues . All other things being equal , a higher proportion of autotrophs in a food web will necessarily mean that a higher proportion of consumers will feed on these basal species . In turn , this would have a dampening eﬀect on the formation of long food chains in the trophic hierarchy and hence fewer possibilities for a varied diet of species at the top . Figure 4 . 1 exempliﬁes how this hypothesis could lead to very diﬀerent food CHAPTER 3 . NOVEL PATTERNS IN FOOD WEB MODELLING 53 web structures . Established food web models do not treat basal species density as a predictor for emergent structure but rather as an emergent property itself . On the other hand , most food webs have been found to be signiﬁcantly more trophically coherent than a random graph with the same density of basal species , so there must be other coherence - inducing mechanisms at play [ 128 ] . Further work is needed to elucidate the reasons behind this property of ecosystem structure . CHAPTER 4 SPREADING PROCESSES ON TROPHIC NETWORKS In the previous chapter we saw how analysing network structure can lead to new insights about complex food webs . It is perhaps surprising that just by looking at connection patterns between interacting agents , in this case feeding relations be - tween species , we can draw conclusions about qualitative diﬀerences between the networks . However , network structure is only half the story . When we study dy - namical processes on top of networked systems , we uncover a whole new world of interesting phenomena by incorporating a set of states that nodes in a network can take which are evolved according to some simple rules . Of course , the emergence and nature of these phenomena are also mediated by the underlying network structure . A major area of network science is to understand how diﬀerent network structures aﬀect dynamics . In this chapter we study two simple dynamical processes on the trophic net - work model introduced in the previous chapter . Our aim is to investigate how the dynamics diﬀer as we change the underlying structure of networks . 4 . 1 Background and related work The spreading of activity through a network has been extensively studied in a wide variety of settings [ 23 , 205 ] . Perhaps the most notable example is the study of infectious disease on human contact networks in epidemiology [ 71 , 141 , 195 ] . Math - ematical modelling of infectious disease has a rich history because of its importance in informing public health interventions for the control of disease [ 16 , 137 , 139 ] . In the next section we brieﬂy review basic models and concepts of epidemic models , their extensions on contact networks as well as some spreading processes which do 54 CHAPTER 4 . SPREADING PROCESSES ON TROPHIC NETWORKS 55 not originate from the study of epidemiology . 4 . 1 . 1 Compartmental epidemic models Most of the classical models of epidemic diseases use compartmentalization of the population in which individuals are grouped into compartments according to their disease state ( e . g . susceptible , infected or recovered ) with transition rates for chang - ing from state to state as the disease progresses [ 16 , 137 ] . Without any underlying contact network structure such models are very simplistic and assume that all indi - viduals in a given state are statistically indistinguishable from each other so it makes sense to only study the evolution of proportions of individuals in each compartment . This is the so called “well - mixed” population case because the absence of a contact network implicitly assumes that individuals constantly interact with each other in exactly the same way . 1 The modern mathematical modelling of epidemics was initiated by Kermack and McKendrick [ 139 ] who deﬁne and study a compartmental SIR model ( sometimes also called the Kermack - McKendrick model ) with three disease states—susceptible , infected and recovered . They study the model in the deterministic setting using a set of coupled nonlinear ODEs : dS dt = − βSI dI dt = βSI − γI dR dt = γI , ( 4 . 1 ) where β is the infection rate and γ is the recovery rate . Infection is supported via the law of mass action —the assumption that rate of encounters between susceptible and infected individuals is proportional to the product of their numbers in society as indicated by the βSI terms . 2 This is just another way of saying that the population is well - mixed ( homogeneous mixing assumption ) . The key quantity which determines whether the infection can spread is the so called epidemic threshold R 0 = βS / γ . If R 0 < 1 , each infected person will in turn infect fewer than one person before 1 In fact , the absence of an underlying contact network is equivalent to the case of individuals living on a complete network . 2 It is important to note that this formulation of the SIR model has density dependent transmission—the number of infectious contacts is dependent on the population size . An alter - native way to model SIR dynamics is via frequency dependent transmission where the number of infectious contacts is rescaled by the inverse population size N − 1 . Both modelling assumptions can be justiﬁed depending on the disease dynamics under study , but frequency dependent transmission is usually more natural for infectious disease modelling even though it is diﬀerent from the original Kermack - McKendrick model . CHAPTER 4 . SPREADING PROCESSES ON TROPHIC NETWORKS 56 recovering and the disease will die out . On the other hand , if R 0 > 1 , the opposite is true and the epidemic will spread . The epidemic threshold R 0 is perhaps the single most important quantity in epidemiology . The SIR model can be made more realistic by making it stochastic using reaction diﬀusion equations [ 242 ] . In this case , the SIR model is governed by the reactions S + I β −→ 2 I I γ −→ R , ( 4 . 2 ) and the evolution of the disease is modelled as a continuous time Markov chain [ 216 ] . It is worth noting that although the Markov Chain formulation is exact , its use for acquiring analytic results is limited because of the sheer number of interdependent equations—an SIR model of 3 compartments and N individuals gives rise to a total of 3 N possible states of the epidemic which limits exact results to small systems and very simple dynamics . Because of this , a popular approach is to simulate the epidemic directly using Monte Carlo methods , typically using Gillespie’s algorithm ( also known as the stochastic simulation algorithm or kinetic Monte Carlo ) [ 107 ] . One can show that the deterministic ODE model is an approximation of the full Markov Chain model in which all individuals in the same compartment are assumed to be statistically indistinguishable from each other and the interactions they experience can be described by the average interactions due to the full system [ 23 ] . This approach of reducing a stochastic model to its deterministic limit is sometimes called mean - ﬁeld ( MF ) theory . It is much more realistic to model epidemics on explicit contact network structures [ 19 , 23 , 71 , 72 , 195 ] . In this scenario , instead of implicitly assuming that individuals all interact with each other , they are identiﬁed as nodes of some predeter - mined network structure which prescribes the exact interactions between individuals via the link structure . As in the case of homogeneous mixing , exact results from a Markov Chain formulation are sparse , so practitioners rely on stochastic simu - lations and various mean - ﬁeld approximation schemes ( see [ 141 , 195 ] for thorough reviews ) . Analogously to the homogeneous mixing case , there is a critical epidemi - ological threshold which separates diseases that die out quickly from diseases that spread to infect a considerable part of the network . In this case the threshold is dependent both on the eﬀective infection rate and the network topology . There are many diﬀerent kinds of compartmental models studied in epidemi - ology and beyond [ 195 ] . The SI model only has two compartments and models diseases in which infected individuals remain infected indeﬁnitely . The SIS model CHAPTER 4 . SPREADING PROCESSES ON TROPHIC NETWORKS 57 ( also known as the contact process in the statistical physics literature [ 112 , 116 ] ) allows for recovery , but does not grant immunity from the disease . The SEIR model incorporates a latent state ( E for exposed ) to deal with individuals exposed to the disease but not yet infectious while the SIRS model incorporates waning immunity . More complicated compartmental models may also include age structure , popula - tion demographics via birth and death rates and even attempt to move beyond the Markovian assumption to include memory eﬀects and model more realistic infectious periods [ 44 , 159 , 160 ] . 4 . 1 . 2 Complex contagion Classical epidemic models are sometimes called “simple contagions” to reﬂect the fact that individuals have a constant probability of acquiring infection from infec - tious peers for every such exposure and interactions are generally assumed to be independent . Recently , however , there has been an interest in studying “complex contagions” in which various other assumptions are made to make transmission dy - namics more realistic [ 188 ] and applicable to phenomena outside epidemiology such as in modelling rumour spreading or the diﬀusion of innovation . A subset of models that try to capture complex contagion are threshold models . The most famous threshold model is the Watts Global Cascades Model or Watts Threshold Model ( WTM ) [ 247 ] . It is a binary state model with individuals adopting either of two states : S for susceptible and I for infected analogously to epidemic models . Each individual i also has a threshold R i drawn from some distri - bution and ﬁxed in time . The states of the nodes change in time according to an update rule in which a susceptible individual i becomes infected if at least a thresh - old fraction R i of its neighbours are infected , else it remains susceptible . An infected individual remains infected indeﬁnitely . The model exhibits a phase transition from local cascades in which only a ﬁnite number of individuals get infected to global cascades which involve infecting a ﬁnite fraction of the population . Another example of a complex contagion is the so called Generalized Epidemic Process ( GEP ) introduced independently by Janssen et al . [ 125 ] and Dodds and Watts [ 75 ] . This model incorporates memory of past exposures to a contagious inﬂuence and can interpolate between the WTM and a simple SIR model . Recently , it has been shown to be , in fact , a special case of the WTM [ 170 ] . CHAPTER 4 . SPREADING PROCESSES ON TROPHIC NETWORKS 58 4 . 1 . 3 Other spreading processes The literature on spreading processes on networks extends far beyond epidemic and contagion models typically considered in epidemiology . It is beyond the scope of this thesis to discuss the many diﬀerent kinds of processes studied on networks , so we provide some examples together with selected reviews for the interested reader . Examples include random walks and diﬀusion on networks [ 8 , 161 , 166 ] , spin models such as the Ising model , XY model or the Potts model [ 77 ] , synchronization models [ 17 ] , ﬁring neural network models [ 13 , 120 ] , and models of social dynamics , including opinion and voter dynamics [ 58 ] . A recommended textbook that touches upon many of these types of processes has been published by Barrat et al . [ 23 ] . 4 . 1 . 4 Generalized network structures While most of the preceding discussion on spreading processes on networks has historically been focused on simple , undirected networks , the study of spreading processes on more general network structures such as directed or weighted networks as well as multi - layer networks [ 43 , 142 ] and temporal networks [ 119 ] has become more prominent in recent years . There is good reason for considering more general network structures as they can confer an even higher degree of realism . For example , weighted networks are the natural framework for considering contagion which is not equally facilitated across all links [ 85 , 102 ] 3 while directed networks become relevant in studying contagion with an intrinsic asymmetry in the propagation such as in some sexually transmitted diseases [ 169 ] or on some social media platforms such as Twitter [ 30 ] . In this chapter we continue the tradition of studying the eﬀect of network structure on spreading dynamics by considering two diﬀerent spreading processes on top of directed networks with a given trophic coherence . 4 . 1 . 5 A note on discrete vs continuous time dynamics In the preceding discussion on spreading processes , we have implicitly assumed con - tinuous time dynamics . Working in continuous time is equivalent to asynchronous updating of individual states as exempliﬁed by Gillespie’s algorithm [ 107 ] . Alter - natively , one can choose to work in discrete time steps which naturally corresponds to parallel or synchronous updating of individual states . Synchronous updating of states has the advantage of allowing fast simulations , but care must be taken if 3 This scenario is similar to studying contagion in which the rate of infection is individual de - pendent [ 138 , 181 ] . CHAPTER 4 . SPREADING PROCESSES ON TROPHIC NETWORKS 59 discrete time simulations are used as approximations to genuinely continuous time dynamics [ 94 ] . For us , we have chosen the spreading processes deﬁned in the fol - lowing section to be naturally discrete so we do not face these approximation issues . For a more comprehensive discussion on these two approaches see [ 205 , Sec . 3 . 5 ] . 4 . 2 Two spreading processes With a view of exploring the inﬂuence of trophic structure on how activity of some kind spreads through a directed network , we consider two diﬀerent paradigmatic spreading processes : a model of complex contagion and a ﬁring neural network model . In both models we take time to be discrete and update nodes in parallel ( synchronously ) . 4 . 2 . 1 Complex contagion model Our ﬁrst model is an adaptation of the classical Susceptible - Infected - Susceptible ( SIS ) epidemic model [ 195 ] which bears resemblance to the global cascades model [ 247 ] in that spreading dynamics is governed by the proportion of a node’s infected neighbours . In this model each node i in a network at time t is characterized by a binary state variable s i ( t ) which can take two values : s i ( t ) = S if node i is susceptible or s i ( t ) = I if node i is infected . Next , we need to specify spreading dynamics . First , a node which was infected at time t automatically becomes susceptible again at time t + 1 : P [ s i ( t + 1 ) = S | s i ( t ) = I ] = 1 . ( 4 . 3 ) In deﬁning transmission dynamics , we incorporate the phenomenon of “complex con - tagion” whereby an “infection” event can be a non - linear function of the proportion of neighbours of the node in question who are already infected [ 12 , 188 ] . Speciﬁcally , at each time step t + 1 a susceptible node i becomes infected with probability given by P [ s i ( t + 1 ) = I | s i ( t ) = S ] = (cid:18) n i k i (cid:19) α , ( 4 . 4 ) where n i is the number of infected in - neighbours ( i . e . nodes j such that a ji = 1 ) at time t and k i is the in - degree of node i . The parameter α introduces a non - linearity in the dynamics leading to diﬀerent complex contagion scenarios . When α is between 0 and 1 , the probability is a concave function of the proportion of infected CHAPTER 4 . SPREADING PROCESSES ON TROPHIC NETWORKS 60 neighbours which means that the probability to be infected grows rapidly with the ﬁrst few infected contacts of a susceptible node and slowly thereafter . On the other hand , if α > 1 the probability is convex meaning that a large proportion of infected neighbours is required to trigger an infection event . Finally , if α = 1 , the probability of infection is linearly proportional to the fraction of infected neighbours . This is equivalent to the global cascades model [ 247 ] with uniformly distributed threshold values with the diﬀerence that nodes in our model recover immediately . 4 . 2 . 2 Neural network model The second model we consider is a version of the Amari - Hopﬁeld neural network [ 13 , 120 ] . As in the contagion model , each node has a binary state variable v i ( t ) = ± 1 representing that at time t a neuron can either ﬁre an action potential or not . The probability of node i updating its state at time t + 1 is given by a sigmoid P [ v i ( t + 1 ) = ± 1 ] = 1 2 ( ± tanh [ βh i ( t ) ] + 1 ) , ( 4 . 5 ) where h i ( t ) = (cid:88) j a ji v j ( t ) ( 4 . 6 ) is a “ﬁeld” experienced by node i whose strength is determined by the aggregate state of its in - neighbours . The parameter β allows for a degree of stochasticity , i . e . for low β the updates become increasingly random as nodes switch between states spontaneously and the ﬁeld h i plays no role while for high β the dynamics become more deterministic . The ﬁeld h i classically takes the adjacency matrix a ij to be weighted to account for the eﬀect of diﬀerent synaptic weights , but for our purposes we consider all weights to be equal to unity . 4 . 3 Coherent networks For completeness , we brieﬂy recall the construction of the trophic network ensemble described in the previous chapter ( see Section 3 . 2 for a full discussion ) that serves as the network backbone that we study the spreading processes on . We start with B basal nodes ( i . e . nodes with zero in - degree ) and proceed to introduce N − B non - basal nodes sequentially at each step choosing one random in - neighbour for each new node . At the end of this procedure the network has N nodes , each with a preliminary trophic level ˜ s i , and N − B links . Finally , to introduce the remaining L − N + B CHAPTER 4 . SPREADING PROCESSES ON TROPHIC NETWORKS 61 links , we place a link between each pair of nodes ( i , j ) with probability proportional to P [ a ij = 1 ] ∝ exp (cid:18) − ( ˜ s j − ˜ s i − 1 ) 2 2 T 2 (cid:19) , ( 4 . 7 ) where T is a temperature parameter modulating the degree of order or trophic co - herence in the network . The completed networks are then characterized by the distribution of trophic levels s i of nodes and the distribution of trophic distances x ij = s j − s i of links . We denote by q the standard deviation of the distribution of trophic distances so that q = (cid:112) (cid:104) x 2 (cid:105) − 1 . q is called the trophic incoherence parame - ter and measures the disorder of the generated networks—a temperature parameter of T = 0 leads to q = 0 and perfectly coherent or “layered” networks while higher val - ues of T lead to more disorder . Figure 4 . 1 shows two examples of networks generated using this model with identical parameters N , B and L but diﬀerent temperatures T and diﬀerent resulting trophic coherence q . Figure 4 . 2 shows the monotonic depen - dence of q on T as well as the eﬀect of the number of basal species B . Our goal is to study the dynamics of spreading processes on networks that range from ordered ( low T ) to disordered ( high T ) networks . ( a ) ( b ) Figure 4 . 1 : ( a ) An example of a maximally coherent network ( q = 0 ) . ( b ) A network with the same parameters N , B and L as the one on the left , but less trophically coherent ( q = 0 . 49 ) . In both cases , the hight of the nodes on the vertical axis represents their trophic level . The networks were generated with the preferential preying model as described in the main text , with T = 0 . 001 for the one on the left , and T = 1 for the one on the right . 4 . 4 Results In order to numerically investigate the eﬀects of trophic structure on spreading phe - nomena , we generate networks with a speciﬁed number of nodes N , basal nodes B and edges L , but varying temperature parameter T as described in Section 4 . 3 and perform Monte Carlo simulations of each of our dynamical systems on top of these CHAPTER 4 .

The initial condition for both the contagion and neural network model is to set all nodes to susceptible / inactive except for the basal nodes which are all infected / active , i . e . s i ( t ) = S or v i ( t ) = − 1 if k in i > 0 and s i ( t ) = I or v i ( t ) = 1 if k in i = 0 . For each simulation run we measure the duration of the infection , that is , the number of time steps until no nodes are infected , as well as the incidence , the proportion of nodes which have at any time been in the infected state . Figure 4 . 3a shows the mean incidence against T for various value of α . On highly coherent networks ( T (cid:39) 0 ) , the infection spreads to the whole system for any value of α . On leas coherent topologies , however , whether contagion is sub - or super - linear has a strong inﬂuence on spreading : for α > 1 the infection only reaches a fraction of the network , while for α < 1 the eﬀect of coherence on incidence is non - monotonic . In ﬁg . 4 . 3b , where the mean incidence is plotted against α for various values of T , we can see how the eﬀect of α on spreading is modulated by topology , becoming less severe the more coherent the networks . Hence , it is the interplay of both the trophic coherence of the underlying network and the form of the infection probability which determines whether the infection can reach a large proportion of nodes . We also performed a similar investigation of the Amari - Hopﬁeld neural model on networks generated in the same way . The duration is now the number of time steps taken before all nodes are in the inactive ( not ﬁring ) state and the incidence is the proportion of nodes which at any moment during this period adopted the active ( ﬁring ) state . As with the infection , whether this pulse will propagate throughout the whole network is determined by both the neural dynamics , as parametrised by CHAPTER 4 .

Despite the diﬀerent dynamics , the curves bear a resemblance to the infection dynamics in panels ( a ) and ( b ) . In both cases , a high trophic coherence ( T (cid:39) 0 ) can ensure that the pulse of activity will reach most of the network irrespectively of other parameters , whereas if the network is incoherent ( T (cid:29) 0 ) , propagation resulting in a large incidence requires low α ( for the complex contagion model ) or low β ( in the neural network ) respectively . Figure 4 . 4 displays heatmaps of incidence and duration for both the com - plex contagion model ( ﬁgs . 4 . 4a and 4 . 4b ) and the neural network model ( ﬁgs . 4 . 4c and 4 . 4d ) . Figures 4 . 4a and 4 . 4c show the mean incidence against T and the relevant model parameter ( α for the complex contagion and β for the neural network ) , while ﬁgs . 4 . 4b and 4 . 4d show the logarithm of the duration against the same parameters . We performed simulations for a maximum of 10 3 Monte Carlo steps , so any dura - tion above this can mean either a long but eventually ﬁnite ( transient ) period of CHAPTER 4 . SPREADING PROCESSES ON TROPHIC NETWORKS 65 activation or an endemic state in which a degree of activity survives indeﬁnitely . By comparing incidence and duration , we can discern that both models ex - hibit three qualitatively diﬀerent regimes of behaviour : at high T and high α or β , activity dies out quickly without reaching most of the system ; at high T and low α or β , activity spreads to the whole system and remains indeﬁnitely ; ﬁnally , at low T , activity spreads to the whole system but dies out quickly . We can refer to these regimes as inactive , endemic and pulsing respectively . The main qualitative diﬀerence between the behaviour of the two models regards the endemic regime . In the complex contagion case , the endemic regime is conﬁned to suﬃciently incoherent networks and its range increases monotonically with T . On the other hand , in the neural network endemicity occurs for any T if β (cid:46) 2 , and the range is non - monotonic with T , peaking at intermediate values of T . Why does trophic coherence aﬀect the spreading processes as described and in such similar ways for both kinds of dynamics ? Consider ﬁrst the case of complex contagion on a perfectly coherent network ( low T ) , like the one in ﬁg . 4 . 1a . If the basal nodes are all initially infected , then we have from eq . ( 4 . 4 ) that in the next time step the probability of infection for nodes at level s = 2 is P = 1 for any value of α and thus the infections moves up a level . By the same process , one time step later the infections spreads to level s = 3 and continues to spread in this way until it has reached the whole system—at which point the infection dies out because the nodes at the top have no outgoing connections . On an incoherent network ( high T ) , like the one in ﬁg . 4 . 1b , as the infection moves up the trophic levels , the fraction of infected in - neighbours aﬀecting a given node i , f i becomes lower with increasing s i . This is because with increasing T , the connections between nodes span a wider range of trophic levels and since infected nodes recover immediately , it is likely that at any given time a smaller proportion of a node’s in - neighbours will bee infected than in the low T scenario . Hence , if the network is suﬃciently incoherent , a pulse of activity will die out as it progresses up the levels and only reach a ﬁnite fraction of the nodes . This explains why the pulsing regime occurs at low T . According to eq . ( 4 . 5 ) , the above considerations apply also to the neural network model at low T when β is suﬃciently high that the probability of a node being activated when all its in - neighbours are active is P (cid:39) 1 . For the complex contagion to become endemic , given that nodes recover im - mediately after infection , there must be some degree of feedback , i . e . the network must contain cycles . As Johnson and Jones [ 128 ] have shown , the expected number of cycles in a network is a function of its trophic coherence q , and for q below a particular value ( which depends on other topological properties ) , networks are al - CHAPTER 4 .

Symbols indicate diﬀerent network sizes ( N = 1000 , 5000 and 10000 ) and proportions of basal nodes B ( N / B = 10 and 20 ) . In all cases , the mean degree is (cid:104) k (cid:105) = 5 . Averages are over 1000 runs . most always acyclic . This explains the endemic phase which grows in range with T . However , the extent of node reinfection will depend on both the density of cycles and the infection probability as determined by eq . ( 4 . 4 ) ; reinfection is therefore more likely at lower α . Again , this argument extends to the neural - network model with a caveat . In the complex contagion model a node must have at least one infected in - neighbour to have non - zero probability of becoming infected , so for the endemic regime to arise , cycles in the network are a necessity . By contrast , the neural net - work model admits spontaneous node activation for any ﬁnite value of β . If β is low enough , the system enters the standard paramagnetic ( or memoryless ) phase of the model with continuous , random activation of nodes . This explains why the endemic regime for the neural model extends to the full range of T for low β . Finally , the non - monotonic dependence of the endemic regime with T in the neural model seems to be cause by a balance between the two mechanisms we have described for activity propagation : a rapid pulse which can travel of coherent networks and the reverberation allowed for by the cycles present in incoherent ones . It is perhaps noteworthy that this eﬀect of feedback in the neural model is similar to the mechanism of “cluster reverberation” put forward to explain short - term memory [ 130 ] . To conclude , we look into the eﬀects of network size and the proportion of basal nodes on incidence . Figure 4 . 5a shows how incidence depends on T when we ﬁx α = 1 for the complex contagion model and ﬁg . 4 . 5b shows the same for the neural network model with β = 3 . Results are presented for three network sizes CHAPTER 4 . SPREADING PROCESSES ON TROPHIC NETWORKS 67 ( N = 1000 , 5000 and 10000 ) , and two ratios of basal nodes , N / B = 10 and 20 . In the complex contagion model , the lines for diﬀerent N but ﬁxed basal ratio collapse and there is only a small eﬀect of the basal ratio on the incidence at high T . In the neural network model , however , there is a much more pronounced inﬂuence of the basal ratio on the incidence at high T . At high T , a ratio of N / B = 10 allows for the activity to reach the whole system while this is not possible if N / B = 20 . This may be a consequence of the dependence of the mean trophic level on this ratio [ 128 ] which for random graphs has an expected value (cid:104) s (cid:105) = N / B ( see eq . ( 3 . 16 ) ) . When N / B = 20 , the non - monotonicity of incidence with T is also exacerbated slightly by N . 4 . 5 Discussion We have shown that the trophic coherence of directed networks can have a signiﬁcant impact on spreading processes taking place on top of the networks . In particular , our numerical investigation of two very diﬀerent dynamics—one a model inspired by epidemics and the other a neural network model originally put forward to explain associative memory—indicates that this topological feature is relevant for any sys - tem in which some kind of signal is transmitted between agents in such a way that these signals interact . While there is not yet an analytical theory able to describe the precise spreading dynamics as a function of trophic coherence , it is clear that such a theory should take into account two eﬀect : the transmission of pulses of synchronous activities which can occur on highly coherent topologies , and the maintenance of en - demic states enabled by feedback loops on incoherent networks . Trophic coherence has already been shown to play an important role in determining various features of directed networks such as linear stability [ 131 ] , feedback loops [ 128 ] and interval - ity [ 76 ] . We add here to such work by showing that spreading processes are also strongly inﬂuenced by this recently identiﬁed topological feature and submit that more research is required to determine its relationship to other network properties , to build a generalised understanding of its bearing on dynamical processes , and to discover by what mechanisms non - trivial trophic coherence comes about in nature . CHAPTER 5 CLUSTERING AND ROBUSTNESS IN NETWORKS Network robustness or resilience to random or targeted breakdown is a widely stud - ied phenomenon in network science due to its crucial role for designing artiﬁcial networks such as power grids and the Internet as well as understanding connectivity patterns and stability of natural networks [ 7 , 64 , 65 ] . The tool of choice for studying robustness is percolation—the random ( or targeted ) removal of nodes or links on a network , which is among the most widely studied processes in statistical physics [ 2 ] . The robustness of the network is then measured as the fraction of of nodes remaining in the giant connected component . The emergence of robustness in random networks is typically studied in equi - librium ensembles such as the ER and the CM ensembles . Much less is known about the emergence of robustness in systems far from equilibrium . While the equilibrium case only considers the emergence of robustness on average , in this chapter we ex - plore how robustness arises starting from atypical , minimum entropy states of the ensemble and relaxing towards more typical equilibrium states . 5 . 1 Background and related work Robustness of networks is generally studied in the context of percolation theory [ 2 ] . In its simplest form , percolation theory studies the robustness of interconnected systems such as networks by randomly removing a fraction of nodes or links ( cor - responding to site percolation and bond percolation respectively ) and examining the structure of the remaining system . Conventionally , percolation is parametrized by the node or link occupation probability p so that each node or edge is deleted with probability 1 − p . A robust or a resilient network is one which requires a large frac - 68 CHAPTER 5 . CLUSTERING AND ROBUSTNESS IN NETWORKS 69 tion of node / link deletions to lose its giant connected component ( GCC ) while a non - robust network is one which does not require much damage to disintegrate into a union of many small components . This leads naturally to the concept of percola - tion threshold p c which is simply the smallest value of the occupation probability for which a GCC exists with high probability in the N → ∞ limit . It is worth noting that the study of percolation is intimately linked to the study of the SIR disease model on networks as discussed in Chapter 4 [ 138 , 181 ] . Many other types of percolation processes beyond simple site and bond per - colations have been proposed , examples include k - core percolation , in which nodes of degree less than k are progressively removed [ 79 ] , bootstrap percolation , in which a collection of initially “activated” nodes activate their neighbours successively [ 28 ] and a generalized epidemic process which studies percolation via a contagion pro - cess [ 75 , 125 ] . Recently these have all been shown to be special cases of the Watts Threshold Model discussed in Chapter 4 [ 170 ] . Other percolation processes include choice so as to maximise the damage mimicking targeted attacks [ 7 , 65 , 223 ] or to delay the percolation threshold such as in explosive percolation [ 84 ] . Network robustness via percolation can be studied in two ways—on single networks , usually of empirical origin , or on whole random network ensembles . In the ﬁrst instance , there is only one underlying network structure , for example an empir - ical network such as a snapshot of the Internet [ 64 ] or a power grid [ 215 ] . Because of the stochastic nature of percolation , the percolation process is repeated many times for the same network structure and averages of the size of the GCC are computed for each value of p to determine the robustness and percolation threshold of the empiri - cal network . By contrast , for studying percolation in random network ensembles the underlying network structure is also diﬀerent from realization to realization , but the procedure for studying robustness is the same—generate many realization of random networks from some predeﬁned ensemble ( e . g . the conﬁguration model with a ﬁxed degree sequence ) , damage them via percolation and average the resulting sizes of the GCCs [ 55 ] . Studying percolation via simulations is time and resource consuming . In many cases analytical results can be derived to predict the percolation threshold , size of the GCC if it exists and even the size distribution of small components . In some cases these results are exact ( in the N → ∞ limit ) but in others only approximate results have been obtained due to intrinsic correlations in the network structure ( such as the existence of triangles ) . In the next two sections we brieﬂy review approaches to studying network robustness via percolation for ensembles of random tree - like as well as triangle rich networks . CHAPTER 5 . CLUSTERING AND ROBUSTNESS IN NETWORKS 70 5 . 1 . 1 Robustness of tree - like networks The study of network robustness started with the study of random network models itself by Erdős and Rényi [ 89 ] who studied the emergence of the giant connected component ( GCC ) in the Erdős and Rényi ( ER ) random graph model ( see Sec - tion 2 . 3 . 1 ) . In the G ( N , p ) model the link occupation probability p is exactly the same as the bond occupation probability as studied in percolation theory [ 2 ] . The dif - ference between traditional percolation theory and percolation on random graphs is the underlying structure—rather than considering rigid lattice models , more general structures such as the ER model are considered ( see ﬁg . 2 . 3 ) . Erdős and Rényi [ 89 ] showed that there exists a critical link occupation probability ( percolation threshold ) p c = 1 / N over which the G ( N , p ) model almost surely has a unique GCC containing a positive fraction of nodes . Equivalently , in the large network limit ( N → ∞ ) , there is a critical average degree (cid:104) k (cid:105) c = 1 over which a GCC emerges . With the advance of generalized random networks such as the conﬁguration model ( CM ) , robustness results in terms of the existence of a GCC were extended [ 174 ] leading to the celebrated Molloy - Reed criterion which states that in inﬁnite CM networks a GCC exists almost surely provided (cid:104) k 2 (cid:105) − 2 (cid:104) k (cid:105) > 0 . The size of the GCC when it exists was also derived by Molloy and Reed [ 175 ] . Cohen et al . [ 64 ] derive the same expression using a diﬀerent approach and apply it to studying the resilience of the Internet . Schwartz et al . [ 218 ] generalizes this method for directed networks . Slightly later in two seminal papers Callaway et al . [ 55 ] and Newman et al . [ 183 ] introduced the generating function ( GF ) formalism [ 249 ] which allows for an - alytical calculation of the critical point , the size of the GCC if it is present and nu - merical calculation of the size distribution of small components . The GF approach was later extended to directed networks which have a more complicated component structure [ 47 , 78 , 147 ] . Only very recently the GF formalism has yielded an analyt - ical expression for the size distribution of small components in undirected networks [ 149 ] as well as directed and multiplex networks [ 148 ] . More recently , an alternative approach to assess network robustness has emerged—the so called message passing algorithm —ﬁrst introduced in the context of general epidemic models [ 132 ] but later leading to a range of new results about the location of the phase transition for the emergence of the GCC as well as a new , fast algorithm for the numerical calculation of the component size distribution [ 135 ] . The message passing algorithm has also been extended to directed networks leading to new insights about the component structure [ 233 ] . It has also been extended to characterizing robustness of ﬁnite networks which highlights some limitations of the CHAPTER 5 . CLUSTERING AND ROBUSTNESS IN NETWORKS 71 approach when compared to direct numerical simulation [ 234 ] . The huge success of both the GF and the message passing approach has crucially hinged on the “locally tree - like assumption” . Simply put , both approaches for calculating component sizes and the emergence of the GCC only yield exact results in the case of networks with no short loops such as triangles . As we saw in Section 2 . 3 . 2 , large CM networks have exactly this property which have enabled the application of these two approaches to accurately describe the robustness properties of CM networks . However , real networks are rarely triangle - free which makes these methods inadequate for networks with high clustering . In the next section we brieﬂy review approaches to studying robustness of clustered networks . 5 . 1 . 2 Robustness of clustered networks Studying percolation in networks with a non - negligible number of short , closed loops is fundamentally non - trivial because of the structural correlations that do not ex - ist in in tree - like networks . To illustrate this simple fact , consider that in tree - like networks one can safely assume that the second neighbours of a random node are always exactly two links away from the initial node . In networks with short loops such as triangles this is no longer true as the second neighbour of a node can also be a ﬁrst neighbour via a transitive link , see ﬁg . 5 . 1 . Ignoring these correlations leads to overestimating the number of second neighbours and consequently the extent of the giant component [ 182 ] . Nevertheless , several attempts to extend the methods developed for tree - like networks to networks with non - negligible clustering coeﬃ - cients have been made [ 33 , 207 , 220 , 256 ] , although exact results are limited to some special cases [ 73 ] . ( a ) ( b ) Figure 5 . 1 : ( a ) A tree - like network in which no short loops are present . Both second neighbours of the central node are exactly two links away . ( b ) A network with a triangle . One of the second neighbours of the central node is also a ﬁrst neighbour because of the transitive link . Attempts to extend the GF method to networks with considerable clustering CHAPTER 5 . CLUSTERING AND ROBUSTNESS IN NETWORKS 72 have either yielded results for a limited set of networks , ( e . g . networks in which triangles can have no overlapping edges [ 220 ] ) or in contradictory results due to the violation of edge independence in clustered random networks [ 33 ] . Recently the message passing algorithm has also been extended to clustered networks [ 207 ] , but it is inadequate in dealing with whole random network ensembles with clustering . Treating the full ensemble of random networks with a given degree sequence k = { k 1 , k 2 , . . . } and a ﬁxed clustering coeﬃcient C > 0 still proves to be intractable in the general case [ 256 ] . Instead , Del Genio and House [ 73 ] study the special case of k − regular networks , where every node has degree k , and a ﬁxed clustering coeﬃcient C . They show that regardless of the level of clustering , a GCC is always present except in the degenerate C = 1 case in which the network consists of a union of disconnected cliques of size k + 1 . Despite the large body of research surrounding the eﬀect of clustering on the robustness of networks , its implications are still not fully understood which points to a need for more fundamental research of clustered networks . Here we take a step back and explore simple relaxation dynamics of highly clustered networks to an un - clustered ( uncorrelated ) equilibrium state . Speciﬁcally , we study the evolution of the clustering coeﬃcient under two edge rewiring schemes starting with fully clustered , degree - regular networks in which all nodes have the same number of neighbours and a maximal number of triangles . We ﬁnd that under both dynamics whose equilib - rium distributions correspond to the ER random graph and the CM respectively , a GCC emerges via a continuous phase transition . We provide an analytical prediction of the critical point for this transition as well as derive time evolution equations for various network properties . 5 . 2 Methods 5 . 2 . 1 Network metrics We consider undirected graphs with N nodes and L edges described by a sym - metric N × N adjacency matrix A with binary edge variables a ij ∈ { 0 , 1 } for i , j ∈ { 1 , . . . , N } with a ij = 1 , i (cid:54) = j indicating an edge between nodes i and j so that L = (cid:80) i , j A ij . The degree distribution of a network is deﬁned as p k = N k / N , where N k is the number of nodes with degree k . We denote the n th moment of the degree distribution by (cid:104) k n (cid:105) . We deﬁne the multiplicity m ij of an edge ij to be the number of triangles it participates in [ 219 ] . Similarly to the degree distribution , we deﬁne the edge multiplicity ( or simply multiplicity ) distribution as q m = L m / L , where L m is the CHAPTER 5 . CLUSTERING AND ROBUSTNESS IN NETWORKS 73 number of edges with multiplicity m . We denote the n th moment of the multiplicity distribution by (cid:104) m n (cid:105) . The clustering coeﬃcient of a network is deﬁned as three times the number of triangles divided by the number of connected triples , i . e . C = 3 N (cid:52) / N ∧ [ 185 ] . This measure of clustering is properly normalized so that C ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] . It also admits a probabilistic interpretation—it is the probability that a randomly chosen connected triple of nodes is closed . We can express the clustering coeﬃcient in terms of the degree and multi - plicity distributions . For any network we have N ∧ = (cid:88) k (cid:18) k 2 (cid:19) N k = N (cid:88) k (cid:18) k 2 (cid:19) p k = N (cid:104) k 2 (cid:105) − (cid:104) k (cid:105) 2 ( 5 . 1 ) and 3 N (cid:52) = (cid:88) m L m = L (cid:88) m mq m = L (cid:104) m (cid:105) . ( 5 . 2 ) Putting the above results together and noting that in any network L = N (cid:104) k (cid:105) / 2 , we obtain the following general expression for the clustering coeﬃcient : C = (cid:104) k (cid:105)(cid:104) m (cid:105) (cid:104) k 2 (cid:105) − (cid:104) k (cid:105) . ( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 2 . 2 Random network ensembles We study relaxation dynamics of k - regular networks under edge rewiring in two random network ensembles—the conﬁguration model ( CM ) and the Erdős – Rényi random graph ( ER ) . The CM [ 48 , 174 , 185 ] is deﬁned by drawing a valid degree sequence k = { k i } Ni = 1 from a degree distribution p k and producing a network realization uniformly at random from all possible networks with that degree sequence [ 74 , 185 ] . Provided the second moment of the degree distribution remains ﬁnite , it can be shown that the clustering coeﬃcient scales as C ∼ 1 / N so that in the thermodynamic limit ( N → ∞ ) the resulting networks are tree - like [ 185 ] . The ER random graph [ 88 , 89 , 105 ] is deﬁned by placing L edges uniformly at random between N nodes 1 . If we require that the mean degree (cid:104) k (cid:105) = 2 L / N be ﬁxed , the degree distribution of the ER model in the thermodynamic limit is Poisson with mean (cid:104) k (cid:105) [ 185 ] . The ER model is thus a special case of the CM and has the same scaling behaviour of the clustering coeﬃcient . 1 Another common deﬁnition leading to a slightly diﬀerent model is to place each of the possible (cid:0) N 2 (cid:1) edges with equal probability p , but this does not enforce a ﬁxed number of edges . CHAPTER 5 . CLUSTERING AND ROBUSTNESS IN NETWORKS 74 Given that both the CM and ER random graphs are asymptotically triangle - free , it is natural to consider them as equilibrium ensembles for relaxation dynamics of highly clustered networks into an unclustered state . To this end we describe two edge rewiring mechanisms that have the CM and the ER random graphs as equilibrium distributions ( see ﬁg . 5 . 2 for a graphical demonstration ) . 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 5 . 2 : ( a ) Double edge swap or degree - preserving randomization . ( b ) Edge replacement or full randomization . Double edge swap ( CM ) . The double - edge swap [ 172 , 208 ] is deﬁned by choosing two existing edges in the network at random and rewiring their ends to produce two new edges while deleting the original two . This is also known as degree - preserving randomization and so naturally produces network realizations in the CM ensemble with a ﬁxed degree sequence . The double - edge swap deﬁnes a Markov chain whose equilibrium distribution is the CM [ 208 ] . Edge replacement ( ER ) . Alternatively , one can fully randomize a network by picking an edge at random and placing it anywhere in the network where there is no edge already [ 158 , 178 ] . In this scheme the number of edges is preserved but the degrees of the nodes are not . Edge replacement deﬁnes a Markov chain whose equilibrium distribution is the ER ensemble . A double - edge swap or an edge replacement constitutes an elementary rewiring step . 5 . 3 Results To assess the evolution of network measures over time , we take into account the network size and the rewiring scheme ( either CM or ER ) to normalize the number of elementary rewiring steps per number of edges . If r CM and r ER are the number of elementary rewiring steps in the CM and ER ensembles respectively , we deﬁne the CHAPTER 5 .

( 5 . 4 ) These deﬁnitions have the useful interpretation that when t scheme = 1 , the rewiring scheme has , on average , modiﬁed each edge in the network . 5 . 3 . 1 Multiplicity distribution The multiplicity distribution evolves over time as edges are rewired and triangles are destroyed . The initial conﬁguration of a k - regular network is a disjoint union of N / ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 ) cliques of size (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 which ensures maximal clustering C = 1 . In other words , at time t = 0 , the multiplicity distribution is (cid:40) q (cid:104) k (cid:105)− 1 = 1 q m = 0 if m (cid:54) = (cid:104) k (cid:105) − 1 . ( 5 . 5 ) Consider the smallest informative time step ∆ t CM = 2 / L or ∆ t ER = 1 / L corresponding to exactly one elementary rewiring step . At t = 0 a clique of size (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 has exactly (cid:0) (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 2 (cid:1) edges all of which have maximal multiplicity (cid:104) k (cid:105) − 1 . Rewiring any single edge will destroy (cid:104) k (cid:105) − 1 triangles leading to a decrease of 2 ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) − 1 ) + 1 edges with maximal multiplicity , one for the rewired edge and an additional two for each destroyed triangle . Assuming that no new triangles are created , the single rewired edge will have multiplicity zero . Figure 5 . 3 shows the transition rates in the multiplicity distribution of a single clique . We now make the ansatz that this is the main way the multiplicity distribu - tion changes over time—multiplicity is predominantly decreased by rewiring single edges from cliques and all such rewirings are independent . In this case , we can write down the full transition rate diagram between multiplicity classes as shown in CHAPTER 5 .

( 5 . 6 ) Figure 5 . 5 shows the numerical solution of these ODEs which is in excellent agreement with simulation results . The calculations are valid both in the ER and the CM case . Average multiplicity . Using the time evolution equations for the multiplicity distribution , we can derive exact expressions of its moments . Speciﬁcally we are interested in the average multiplicity (cid:104) m (cid:105) as it features in the expression for the CHAPTER 5 . CLUSTERING AND ROBUSTNESS IN NETWORKS 77 clustering coeﬃcient . We have d (cid:104) m (cid:105) dt = (cid:104) k (cid:105)− 1 (cid:88) m = 1 mdq m dt . ( 5 . 7 ) Inserting eq . ( 5 . 6 ) we obtain the simple expression d (cid:104) m (cid:105) dt = − 3 (cid:104) m (cid:105) . ( 5 . 8 ) Using the initial condition (cid:104) m (cid:105) ( 0 ) = (cid:104) k (cid:105) − 1 , this has solution (cid:104) m (cid:105) = ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) − 1 ) e − 3 t . ( 5 . 9 ) Figure 5 . 5 shows the analytic solution of the average multiplicity which is in perfect agreement with simulation results . 5 . 3 . 2 Degree distribution In the case of the ER model , the degree distribution is also changing over time . Consider the degree distribution p k ( t ) as a function of time and a time step ∆ t ER . We can calculate the rate at which p k ( t ) changes . An edge replacement event in the ER model consists of two steps . First , a random edge is selected . Second , a random pair of nodes that are not linked by an edge ( let us call this pair a non - edge ) is selected and the edge selected in the ﬁrst step is deleted while the non - edge becomes an edge . When a random edge is selected , p k can decrease if at least one end of the edge has degree k . Alternatively , p k can increase if at least one end of the edge has degree k + 1 . The probability of reaching a node of degree k by following a randomly chosen edge is given by the so called excess degree distribution [ 185 ] which reads s k = kp k / (cid:104) k (cid:105) . Given this and the fact that a randomly chosen edge can have 0 , 1 or 2 nodes of degree k , we can calculate the expected number of nodes of degree k at the ends of a random edge : E ( k → k − 1 ) = 2 s 2 k + 2 s k ( 1 − s k ) = 2 s k = 2 kp k (cid:104) k (cid:105) . ( 5 . 10 ) This is the expected number of nodes whose degree would decrease from k to k − 1 during a single edge selection step . Note that at the beginning of the process the degree distribution is regular so E ( k → k − 1 ) = 2 as expected . Similarly , the expected number of nodes whose degree would decrease from CHAPTER 5 . CLUSTERING AND ROBUSTNESS IN NETWORKS 78 k + 1 to k leading to an increase in p k is : E ( k + 1 → k ) = 2 s k + 1 = 2 ( k + 1 ) p k + 1 (cid:104) k (cid:105) . ( 5 . 11 ) Now consider the second step in the edge replacement event , the selection of a non - edge . When a random non - edge is selected , p k can also change in two ways . It can increase if at least one of the selected nodes has degree k − 1 and it can decrease if at least one of the nodes has degree k . The calculation of the expected number of nodes changed as a result of this is similar to the previous case , but we must consider the distribution of non - degrees instead . To this end we study the graph complement of the original network deﬁned as a network in which two nodes are linked if and only if they are not linked in the original network . From here on we denote by an overbar quantities in the graph complement . It is easy to see that the degrees of nodes in the complement are given by ¯ k = N − 1 − k where k is the degree of a node in the original network and we have p ¯ k = p k . Thus , the non - edges are selected proportionally to ¯ k not k as in the case of edge selection so we must work with the excess non - degree distribution given by s ¯ k = ¯ kp k / (cid:104) ¯ k (cid:105) . Note that the mean non - degree is given by (cid:104) ¯ k (cid:105) = (cid:88) k ¯ kp k = N − 1 − (cid:104) k (cid:105) . ( 5 . 12 ) As in the case of edge selection , the expected number of nodes whose degree would increase from k to k + 1 thus reducing p k during a single non - edge selection step is E ( k → k + 1 ) = 2 q ¯ k = 2¯ kp k (cid:104) ¯ k (cid:105) = 2 ( N − 1 − k ) N − 1 − (cid:104) k (cid:105) p k . ( 5 . 13 ) When N is large we can approximate this by E ( k → k + 1 ) (cid:39) 2 p k . ( 5 . 14 ) Similarly , p k can increase if we select a non - edge with at least one node with degree k − 1 . The expected number of such nodes in a single non - edge selection is E ( k − 1 → k ) (cid:39) 2 p k − 1 .

This allows us to write down the time evolution equations for p k : dp k dt = 2 p k − 1 − 2 (cid:18) 1 + k (cid:104) k (cid:105) (cid:19) p k + 2 k + 1 (cid:104) k (cid:105) p k + 1 , ( 5 . 16 ) for k = 0 , 1 , . . . . This system of ODEs is not closed , so in order to solve it numerically , we must truncate the system at some p k ∗ setting p k = 0 for all k > k ∗ . The value of k ∗ should be set high enough so the probability mass unaccounted for is minimal for accurate predictions . We test our predictions by numerically solving the ODEs for a network with average degree (cid:104) k (cid:105) = 2 and setting the cut - oﬀ k ∗ = 8 . The results are shown in ﬁg . 5 . 7 . The numerical solution of the ODE system is in excellent agreement with simulation results . We also note that the cut - oﬀ is appropriate for this level of approximation as the total probability mass does not diverge from unity noticeably over the time period considered . 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 t ER 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 p k p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 total mass Figure 5 . 7 : Evolution of the degree distribution in an ER network with average degree (cid:104) k (cid:105) = 2 and N = 10 5 − 1 .

Using the time evolution equa - tions for the degree distribution , we can derive exact expressions of its moments . CHAPTER 5 . CLUSTERING AND ROBUSTNESS IN NETWORKS 80 Speciﬁcally , we are interested in the second moment (cid:104) k 2 (cid:105) . We have d (cid:104) k 2 (cid:105) dt = (cid:88) k k 2 dp k dt . ( 5 . 17 ) Inserting eq . ( 5 . 16 ) we obtain the simple expression d (cid:104) k 2 (cid:105) dt = − 4 (cid:104) k 2 (cid:105) (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 4 (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 4 . ( 5 . 18 ) Using the initial condition (cid:104) k 2 (cid:105) ( 0 ) = (cid:104) k (cid:105) 2 and recalling that the average degree (cid:104) k (cid:105) is constant , this has solution (cid:104) k 2 (cid:105) = (cid:104) k (cid:105) (cid:16) (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 − e − 4 t (cid:104) k (cid:105) (cid:17) . ( 5 . 19 ) 5 . 3 . 3 Clustering coeﬃcient Putting together the results for the multiplicity and degree distributions , and using eq . ( 5 . 3 ) , we obtain exact expressions for the clustering coeﬃcient as a function of time in both the CM and ER ensembles : C CM = e − 3 t C ER = ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) − 1 ) e − 3 t (cid:104) k (cid:105) − e − 4 t (cid:104) k (cid:105) . ( 5 . 20 ) We note that in the CM ensemble , the clustering coeﬃcient has no dependence on the average degree while this is not the case for the ER ensemble . This is because the number of connected triples N ∧ in the CM ensemble is constant by virtue of having a ﬁxed degree sequence while it is dependent on the evolving degree sequence in the ER ensemble . 5 . 3 . 4 Giant connected component We ﬁnd that under both rewiring schemes there is an emergence of global connec - tivity via the appearance of a giant connected component ( GCC ) at some critical time t c ( equivalently , critical clustering coeﬃcient C c ) . We conﬁrm from simulation results that a GCC emerges in a continuous phase transition ( ﬁgs . 5 . 8 and 5 . 9 for the CM and ﬁgs . 5 . 10 and 5 . 11 for the ER ensembles ) . Note that the large ﬂuctuations in the 2 - regular case is due to the fact that 2 - regular networks are exactly at the point of criticality in the unclustered CM case ( C = 0 ) . This phenomenon has been studied in the context of reversible polymerization of rings [ 31 ] . CHAPTER 5 .

We observe a continuous phase transition at a critical point C cER which depends on the average degree of the network as explained in the main text . Vertical lines correspond to the analytically calculated critical points . CHAPTER 5 . CLUSTERING AND ROBUSTNESS IN NETWORKS 83 We can calculate the critical point analytically by using the known result that a GCC in an ER random graph emerges when (cid:104) k (cid:105) = 1 [ 185 ] . We conjecture that a GCC induced by edge rewiring emerges when the average number of external edges between the original N / ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 ) cliques of size (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 exceeds one . If this is the case , the critical number of elementary rewiring steps is r c = N 2 ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 ) . ( 5 . 21 ) Expressing this in terms of the time variable , we obtain the critical time for both the CM and the ER rewiring schemes : t cCM = 2 (cid:104) k (cid:105) ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 ) t cER = 1 (cid:104) k (cid:105) ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 ) . ( 5 . 22 ) Note that these diﬀer by a factor of two . This is because in the CM rewiring scheme , even though every elementary rewiring step involves two edges , the two rewirings are not independent—during one rewiring step it is possible to connect at most two disconnected components . Expressed in terms of the clustering coeﬃcient , the critical thresholds read : C cCM = e − 6 / (cid:104) k (cid:105) ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 ) C cER = ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) − 1 ) e − 3 / (cid:104) k (cid:105) ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 ) (cid:104) k (cid:105) − e − 4 / (cid:104) k (cid:105) 2 ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 ) . ( 5 . 23 ) Figures 5 . 8 and 5 . 9 conﬁrm that these are in excellent agreement with simu - lations in the CM case and ﬁgs . 5 . 10 and 5 . 11 conﬁrm a good agreement in the ER case which improves as the mean degree increases . What is the cause of the discrepancy of the analytical result for the critical point and the numerical simulations , particularly for low mean degree ER networks ? We conjecture that this is due to some edges being rewired multiple times while others are not rewired at all . This would have the eﬀect of increasing the critical time because we have to wait slightly longer until the average number of rewired edges discounting edges rewired multiple times reaches the point where long range connectedness emerges . Figure 5 . 10 seems to conﬁrm this to be the case . Let us calculate this revised critical time in the ER case . During an edge replacement step , the probability of any edge being chosen for rewiring is 1 / L . So after r rewiring events the probability that a speciﬁc edge CHAPTER 5 . CLUSTERING AND ROBUSTNESS IN NETWORKS 84 has not been rewired is P ( not rewired ) = (cid:18) 1 − 1 L (cid:19) r . ( 5 . 24 ) Substituting r = Lt since we are in the ER case and taking the limit as L → ∞ , we get P ( not rewired ) = e − t . ( 5 . 25 ) The new revised time for the emergence of the GC , call it t r , is then the time at which point this probability drops below a certain threshold . What is this threshold ? It should be when the proportion of edges that have been rewired gives rise to a GCC which is precisely given by t c . We can then write e − t r = 1 − t c . ( 5 . 26 ) Note that by Taylor expansion we have t r (cid:39) t c if this time is small as in the case when the average degree (cid:104) k (cid:105) → ∞ . This explains why the t c value becomes a better predictor for the critical threshold as the mean degree increases as seen in ﬁg . 5 . 10 . The revised critical point in the ER case is thus t r = − log ( 1 − t c ) = log (cid:18) (cid:104) k (cid:105) ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 ) (cid:104) k (cid:105) ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 ) − 1 (cid:19) . ( 5 . 27 ) Figure 5 . 12 conﬁrms that t r is a better predictor of the location of the phase tran - sition . The diﬀerence between t c and t r becomes negligible as the mean degree increases . Another aspect that could inﬂuence the position of the critical point is the possibility of having rewired more edges that needed to connect previously discon - nected components . We show in Section 5 . A that this should have no bearing on the critical point in large networks . 5 . 4 Discussion In this chapter we studied the evolution of highly clustered networks under ran - dom edge rewiring dynamics . Our main result is showing the existence of a phase transition in which a giant connected component emerges . Del Genio and House [ 73 ] showed that equilibrium ensembles of degree - regular networks with prescribed clustering always admit a giant connected component . As a consequence , spreading processes such as infectious diseases in contact networks could always become en - CHAPTER 5 .

Solid vertical lines correspond to the critical time t c ER while dashed vertical lines correspond to the revised critical time t rER . demic regardless of the level of clustering . By contrast , our work implies that this need not be the case in non - equilibrium systems . Depending on the precise mech - anisms of time evolution of real networks and the level of clustering maintained , a giant connected component facilitating spreading processes may or may not exist . We have studied a model in which highly clustered populations undergo fully ran - dom connectivity changes and even in this simple scenario we observe two diﬀerent modes of global connectivity . Another interesting aspect of our work is from the perspective of statisti - cal mechanics . A maximally clustered network is essentially the lowest entropy microstate in the context of the random network ensembles studied here . This is because such a network , under relabelling of nodes , is unique and least likely to be produced by chance at equilibrium . By using this conﬁguration as a starting state for network dynamics , we have shown that the emergence of global connectivity is eﬀec - tively delayed . This raises several other research questions , for example , is random rewiring the most or least eﬀective method of delaying the onset of global connectiv - ity ? It is probable that more sophisticated rewiring methods involving choice , such as those studied in explosive percolation [ 84 ] , would lead to diﬀerent critical thresh - olds . We have also limited ourselves to studying rewiring that consistently destroys triangles , but what about rewiring with a view to increase the number of triangles ? A number of greedy as well as equilibrium algorithms exist and are widely applied to model highly clustered networks [ 98 , 210 ] , but it is unclear how they cover the space of all networks and can lead to interesting behaviour such as hysteresis loops [ 98 ] . Indeed , clustering in networks still leaves much to be explored . CHAPTER 5 . CLUSTERING AND ROBUSTNESS IN NETWORKS 86 5 . A Extraneous edges Another mechanism that could change the location of the critical point t c is the number of extraneous edges between already connected components . A GCC is formed when there are enough external edges between the initial cliques . Only one external edge is needed to connect two cliques , but there are multiple ways to do it and sometimes multiple edges end up linking together the same cliques . For example , we need only one edge two join two disconnected triangles , but there are a total of 9 ways to do it , moreover there is no guarantee that we will not end up with multiple edges between these triangles . More generally , let the average degree (cid:104) k (cid:105) be ﬁxed , then at t = 0 there are n = N / ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 ) cliques of size (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 . Any two cliques can therefore be connected in ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 ) 2 ways . Suppose we never want to make more than one external edge to connect disconnected components . Then at t = 0 the number of choices for placing an external edge is given by ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 ) (cid:18) n 2 (cid:19) = N ( N − (cid:104) k (cid:105) − 1 ) 2 . ( 5 . 28 ) After each rewiring event , the number of choices decreases by ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 ) 2 , so after r − 1 rewires , the probability of placing an extraneous edge on the next rewire , r , is P ( extra edge on step r ) = 2 ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 ) 2 r N ( N − (cid:104) k (cid:105) − 1 ) . ( 5 . 29 ) Thus , the expected number of extraneous edges after r rewiring events is E ( extra edges by step r ) = r (cid:88) r (cid:48) = 0 2 ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 ) 2 r (cid:48) N ( N − (cid:104) k (cid:105) − 1 ) . ( 5 . 30 ) In particular , setting r = r c = N / 2 ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 ) we get E ( extra edges by step r c ) = 2 ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 ) 2 N ( N − (cid:104) k (cid:105) − 1 ) · N 4 ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 ) (cid:18) N 2 ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 1 ) + 1 (cid:19) = N + 2 (cid:104) k (cid:105) + 2 4 ( N − (cid:104) k (cid:105) − 1 ) . ( 5 . 31 ) CHAPTER 5 . CLUSTERING AND ROBUSTNESS IN NETWORKS 87 Taking the limit N → ∞ , we get E ( extra edges by step r c ) (cid:39) 1 4 , ( 5 . 32 ) which is ﬁxed and independent of network size . Therefore , the formation of extra - neous edges does not aﬀect the location of the critical point in the large network limit . CHAPTER 6 CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK The studies considered in this thesis provide us with insights about the structure , organization and dynamics of complex networked systems . Some research questions in network science are motivated by an ever increasing amount of data while others consider fundamental properties of network models as their starting point of investi - gation . Here we have presented a synthesis of both data driven research ( Chapter 3 ) and theoretical inquiry ( Chapters 4 and 5 ) into network science . Studying the make - up of ecological interactions may prove to be the corner - stone in understanding the relationship between human activity and nature , and is especially relevant in the age of ever more prevalent markers of climate change . Food webs have fascinated ecologists for decades due to their structural features resulting , for example , in counter - intuitive stability properties in the face of ever increasing complexity [ 131 , 167 ] . In Chapter 3 we investigated how local preying patterns , con - ceptualized as network motifs , relate to large - scale organization described by trophic coherence . We found that the motif corresponding to omnivory—the tendency to prey on species from several trophic levels—is strongly correlated with trophic co - herence and provides a basis of clustering food webs into two families—ones where omnivory is widespread and the others where it is sparse . Our network model which incorporates tunable trophic coherence can successfully generate artiﬁcial food webs in either family , suggesting the importance of trophic coherence as well as basal species density in modelling realistic food webs . However , the biological origin of trophic coherence and the fragmentation of food webs into distinct families depend - ing on the extent of ommnivory is still not understood . This is an important research question both for network scientists and ecologists in order to understand how food 88 CHAPTER 6 . CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK 89 webs assemble in nature . Network structures are not only interesting because of the complex structural patterns often found in empirically observed networks , but also because of their propensity to support dynamical processes on top of their topologies . In Chapter 4 we studied two paradigmatic spreading processes—a complex contagion inspired by epidemics and a neural network process—on directed networks with tunable trophic coherence . Our results uncovered a rich interplay between network structure and the fate of outbreaks ranging from short - lived but global infections to endemic infections conﬁned to a small subset of nodes . These results could help our understanding of a variety of network processes taking place on directed networks—from epidemics and rumour spreading to shocks to ecosystems . The study of the relationships between local and global network properties and how change in one inﬂuences another is a widely studied topic in network sci - ence . However , many attempts in quantifying these eﬀects end up with inconclusive results due to the inherent diﬃculties in studying random networks that exhibit strong link dependence . In Chapter 5 we laid the groundwork for studying how clustering inﬂuences the formation of a giant connected component in ensembles of random networks . Contrary to previous approaches that study the problem at equilibrium , we use a non - equilibrium approach by selecting unlikely network states ( maximal clustering ) and studying their relaxation to common network states ( low clustering ) within the ensemble of interest . We show that by selecting highly unlikely conﬁgurations with a maximal number of triangles , the onset of the giant connected component can be delayed , unlike in the case of equilibrium networks . Our research readily raises several other research questions about the organization of complex systems . For example , is random rewiring the most eﬀective method of delaying the formation of a GCC or are there methods , possibly including choice in the rewiring akin to explosive percolation [ 84 ] , that would eﬀect the position of the phase tran - sition ? When considering directed networks , an analogous research question would be to study the emergence of a strongly connected component when starting from highly coherent network conﬁgurations as considered in Chapters 3 and 4 . Our focus in this thesis has been on simple directed and undirected net - works , however , in recent years several generalizations of network structures have been proposed to better capture the interactions in real world systems . Multilayer networks [ 43 , 142 ] is a framework suited for studying complex systems which are made up of of a number of interacting , but fundamentally distinct networks . Exam - ples include transportation multilayer networks [ 9 ] in which nodes represent stops or interchanges and links in each layer correspond to diﬀerent transportation types . CHAPTER 6 . CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK 90 Another example is social media networks—people are represented by nodes but con - nections between them will vary between diﬀerent social media platforms and real life connections [ 155 , 162 ] . Simplicial complexes , originally studied in the context of al - gebraic topology [ 113 ] , have become an interesting tool of modelling complex systems in which more than two nodes can have interactions between them thus generalizing the inherent dyadic interactions represented by links in networks [ 68 , 69 , 253 , 257 ] . The quintessential example is scientiﬁc collaboration networks . A transitive rela - tionship between three authors in a classical network description cannot distinguish between the case that all three authors have collaborated on the same paper and the case that they have collaborated only pairwise on distinct papers . A simplicial complex description , however , allows for both kinds of interactions to be present and distinguishable from one another . Hypergraphs take the notion of simplicial com - plexes and extends it even further allowing very general interactions between any set of nodes [ 35 , 104 ] . Generalized network structures is a ﬂourishing ﬁeld with many recent results obtained as generalizations of simpler results on networks . This is sure to become an exciting new paradigm for studying complex , interacting systems . BIBLIOGRAPHY [ 1 ] Luis G Abarca - Arenas and Robert E Ulanowicz .
