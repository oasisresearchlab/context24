Short Title : PCDH19 mutations in Female Epilepsy Communicated by < Please don’t enter > ABSTRACT : Mutations in PCDH19 , encoding protocadherin 19 on chromosome X , cause familial epilepsy and mental retardation limited to females or Dravet - like syndrome . Heterozygous females are affected while hemizygous males are spared , this unusual mode of inheritance being probably due to a mechanism called cellular interference . To extend the mutational and clinical spectra associated with PCDH19 , we screened 150 unrelated patients ( 113 females ) with febrile and afebrile seizures for mutations or rearrangements in the gene . Fifteen novel point mutations were identified in 15 female patients ( 6 sporadic and 9 familial cases ) . In addition , qPCR revealed two whole gene deletions and one partial deletion in 3 sporadic female patients . Clinical features were highly variable but included almost constantly a high sensitivity to fever and clusters of brief seizures . Interestingly , cognitive functions were normal in several family members of 2 families : the familial condition in family 1 was suggestive of Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus ( GEFS + ) whereas all three affected females had partial cryptogenic epilepsy . These results show that mutations in PCDH19 are a relatively frequent cause of epilepsy in females and should be considered even in absence of family history and / or mental retardation . © 2010 Wiley - Liss , Inc .

EFMR is a disorder with a remarkable X - linked inheritance : only females with heterozygous mutations are affected whereas males with hemizygous mutations are unaffected ( Fabisiak and Erickson , 1990 ; Juberg and Hellman , 1971 ; Ryan , et al . , 1997 ) . This unusual mode of inheritance is likely to be due to cellular interference , a mechanism assuming that only the co - existence of PCDH19 - positive and - negative cells , as a result of random X inactivation in females , is pathogenic ( Depienne , et al . , 2009 ; Johnson , 1980 ; Wieland , et al . , 2004 ) . The phenotype of EFMR varies from mild to severe in terms of seizure type and severity as well as in the degree of cognitive impairment ( Scheffer , et al . , 2008 ) . Seizures begin in infancy or early childhood ( 6 – 36 months ) and are sensitive to fever in most patients . Patients present with variable seizure types including tonic - clonic , tonic , atonic , absences , myoclonic jerks and partial seizures . Behavioral problems are often part of the clinical picture and can manifest as autistic , obsessive or aggressive features ( Depienne , et al . , 2009 ; Scheffer , et al . , 2008 ) . Recently , we have shown that the clinical spectrum associated with PCDH19 mutations can overlap that of Dravet syndrome ( Depienne , et al . , 2009 ) . Intellectual outcome was reported to range from normal intellect to mental retardation within families ; however , all patients reported to date either had intellectual disability or belonged to families where cognitive delay was present in other family members ( Scheffer , et al . , 2008 ) . In the present study , we have screened 150 unrelated probands with diverse epilepsy subtypes with or without cognitive impairment or mental retardation in order to define the mutational and clinical spectra associated with PCDH19 mutations .

The referral physicians filled a detailed clinical questionnaire for every patient and clinical reports were also collected for most patients to assess the clinical history of the disease . Ninety - five percent ( n = 142 ) of the patients had been initially referred to our diagnosis laboratory for genetic testing of SCN1A based on the association of febrile and afebrile seizures . Most patients ( n = 104 ) had no family history of epilepsy . These sporadic cases include 16 patients with DS in whom SCN1A testing was negative . Forty - six probands had at least one relative with epilepsy . The mode of inheritance was compatible with that of EFMR in 10 families . Eight families were reported as GEFS + ( Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus ) conditions . Eight families had a homogeneous phenotype of generalized idiopathic epilepsy ( n = 5 ) or partial epilepsy ( n = 3 ) . Informed written consent was obtained from the patients’ parents before blood sampling . This study was approved by the ethical committee ( CCPPRB of Pitié - Salpêtrière Hospital , Paris , n°69 - 03 , 25 / 9 / 2003 ) . PCDH19 Screening The coding sequence of PCDH19 ( transcript reference EF676096 ) was amplified in 11 fragments , and screened using direct sequencing , as already described ( Depienne , et al . , 2009 ) . Mutations found in patients were directly searched for in available parents using direct sequencing of the corresponding amplicon . When the mutation was absent from both parents , parental testing was performed using microsatellite markers at the PCDH19 locus to ensure that the mutation occurred de novo . In addition , 190 French controls ( 95 females and 95 males who were healthy spouses of patients with other autosomal dominant diseases ) and 200 Polish controls ( 118 females and 82 males ) were included to test new variants of the PCDH19 gene . Mutation interpretation and amino acid conservation in orthologs and paralogs was assessed using the Alamut 1 . 31 Software ( Interactive Biosoftware ) and Clustalw ( available at http : / / bioinfo . hku . hk / services / analyseq / cgi - bin / clustalw _ in . pl ) . Deletions or duplications involving PCDH19 were searched for using quantitative real - time PCR . Six primer pairs ( one per exon ) were designed using PrimerExpress 1 . 5 ( sequences available on request ) . Real - time PCR experiments were performed using 100 ng of genomic DNA , 0 . 4 µM of each primer and 12 . 5 µl of Sybr Green PCR master mix ( Applied Biosystems ) in a total volume of 25 µl .

The Infinium II Genotyping reaction steps were performed according to the manufacturer’s specifications . Image data analysis and automated genotype calling was performed using Beadstudio 3 . 1 ( Illumina ) . Breakpoints of the deletions were defined as the first and last SNP comprised in the region of the deletion , which were homozygous and presented a decreased log ratio ( in the order of - 0 . 5 ) .

A total of 15 different mutations , all novel , were identified at the heterozygous state in 15 female patients ( Tables 1A , Figure 1 and supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Eight were missense variants ( c . 242T > G / p . Leu81Arg ; c . 437C > G / p . Thr146Arg ; c . 617T > A / p . Phe206Tyr ; c . 747A > T / p . Glu249Asp ; c . 1023C > G / p . Asp341Glu ; c . 1682C > G / p . Pro561Arg ; c . 1700C > T / p . Pro567Leu ; c . 1852G > A / p . Asp618Asn ) , 2 were nonsense mutations ( c . 462C > A / p . Tyr154X ; c . 2656C > T / p . Arg886X ) , 4 were base pair insertions or deletions introducing a frameshift into the protein sequence ( c . 424delG / p . Ala142ProfsX70 ; c . 514dupG / p . Glu172GlyfsX54 ; c . 697 _ 700delinsTAAC / p . Asp233X ; c . 2019delC / p . Ser674LeufsX2 ) and one was an in - frame duplication of three amino - acids ( c . 415 _ 423dup / p . Ser139 _ Ala141dup ) . All mutations were located in exon 1 with the exception of the p . Arg886X nonsense mutation , which was located in exon 4 . Missense variants all affected amino - acids of the extracellular domain of protocadherin 19 , which are highly conserved in orthologs and in paralogs of PCDH19 ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . To confirm that the 15 mutations were pathogenic , we screened 190 healthy French individuals . None was found in the control population , supporting their deleterious role . Since Family 2 , in which the c . 437C > G / p . Thr146Arg mutation was identified , was of Polish origin , this variant was also tested and not found in 200 healthy Polish Controls . Parents of mutated probands and affected relatives were tested for the mutation when available . Six out of the 15 probands with PCDH19 mutations were isolated cases ( families 3 , 5 , 6 , 11 , 13 and 14 ) but both parents were available in only 3 families . The mutation was absent in both parents in one family out of the 3 , indicating that it arose de novo ( family 11 ) . Remarkably , in the 2 other families ( 13 and 14 ) , the mutation was inherited from the asymptomatic mother . In familial cases ( families 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 and 15 ) , mutations were inherited from a healthy father in 3 families ( families 2 , 9 and 12 ) , leading to a recurrent transmission of the mutation to all the daughters . In families 8 and 15 , which yet include two affected daughters , the mutations were absent from both parents , suggesting germinal mosaicism in one parent . However , the sister of the proband was unavailable for genetic analysis in both families , so it remains uncertain whether the affected sisters had the same mutation than the proband . In families 1 , 4 and 10 , the mutation was inherited from an affected mother and segregated with the disease in all affected family members . It was not possible to determine the origin of the mutation in the remaining Page 7 of 25 John Wiley & Sons , Inc .

In order to uncover micro - rearrangements in PCDH19 that could have been missed by direct sequencing , we developed quantitative real - time PCR assays to measure the copy number of each exon of the gene . This analysis identified two whole gene deletions and a partial deletion spanning exons 1 to 3 , in 3 additional female patients ( Figure 2 and Table 1B ) . Analysis of the corresponding patients’ DNA using high density SNP array revealed that the deletions had different size and breakpoints . The whole gene deletions in patients N07 0897 ( family 17 ) and N07 1329 ( Family 18 ) spanned 0 . 5 and 6 . 3 Mb , respectively , and comprises nearby genes ( Figure 3 ) . The largest deletion encompasses DIAPH2 , a gene possibly involved in oogenesis and associated with premature ovarian failure type 2 ( Bione , et al . , 1998 ) . The 0 . 5 Mb deletion includes TNMD , TSPAN6 , SYTL4 and SRPX2 , the gene responsible for X - linked recessive rolandic seizures associated with oral and speech dyspraxia and mental retardation ( Roll , et al . , 2006 ) . Contrary to the two other deletions , deletion of exons 1 to 3 was limited to the PCDH19 gene in patient N08 0125 ( family 16 ) . Parents of the proband were unavailable in family 17 but analysis of the parents in families 16 and 18 revealed that the deletions arose de novo . Summary of clinical features for PCDH19 - positive patients The clinical features of PCDH19 - positive patients are summarized in Table 2 . The clinical pictures were variable from one patient to another . However , seizures were highly sensitive to fever in most patients , especially in the 2 first years of life and during childhood . Another characteristic feature observed in PCDH19 - positive patients was seizures occurring in clusters ( 2 - 10 seizures per day , lasting over several days ) . Remarkably , cognitive functions ranged from normal to severe intellectual deficiency . Indeed , several or all family members of 2 families ( families 1 and 2 ) had no cognitive impairment . Case reports Family 1 , of French origin , includes 4 female patients . Neonatal periods were uneventful for all patients . The proband ( N05 0550 ) was a 6 - year - old girl . Her affected mother was treated with Phenobarbital ( PB ) during her whole pregnancy . GTCS , lasting ~ 20 seconds and occurring in clusters of 5 - 10 seizures per day , have appeared at 11 months of age , after a febrile episode . Clusters of seizures have persisted for 10 days .

Clinical investigations , including search for infectious agents , lumbar puncture and CT scan , were normal . Seizures persisted but became rarer when the patient was treated with sodium valproate ( VPA ) and Clobazam ( CLB ) , and finally stopped with PB . Later on , GTCS became very rare , occurring most often in afebrile contexts , but absence episodes were sometimes observed . EEGs were normal . Psychomotor development of the patient was normal and she had no school difficulties at 6 years of age . She was still treated by PB at the time of the study . Her mother ( N05 0548 ) was 28 years old at the time of the study . At 18 months of age , while she was febrile , she presented a cluster of 4 - 5 brief GTCS per day that lasted for several days . Later on , febrile or afebrile GTCS regularly recurred until age 7 . VPA appeared inefficient but GTCS finally ceased when she was treated with PB . However , absence episodes , mostly triggered by fatigue were observed . EEGs and cerebral MRI were normal . The maternal grandmother of the proband ( N05 0549 ) was 54 years old when examined for the last time . As her daughter , she has had a cluster of GTCS lasting several days at 18 months of age although it remained uncertain whether she was febrile or not at this time . GTCS persisted until age 10 , and then absences occurred from age 15 . Myoclonic jerks were also noticed during adolescence . VPA was inefficient but PB allowed a reasonable control of the seizures . She was still treated with PB at the time of the study . Her psychomotor development had always been normal and no cognitive deficit was perceptible . EEGs and cerebral MRI remained unavailable . The maternal aunt of the proband ( N09 2223 ) , was 36 years old when examined . At 18 months of age , she developed febrile status epilepticus without later motor deficit but secondary psychomotor decline . When she was 10 , she developed afebrile GTCS and transient losses of consciousness ( suggesting either absences or partial seizures ) . She always had school difficulties and developed psychotic manifestations . At the time of the study , she presented with moderate intellectual deficiency . EEGs during childhood were unavailable but those during adulthood were normal . MRI was normal . During childhood , she was treated with PB which appeared effective . In adulthood , carbamazepine ( CBZ ) was ineffective but she finally became seizure - free under VPA . She was still treated with VPA at the time of the study . Family 2 was of polish Ashkenazi origin on the paternal side . There was no family history of seizures or cognitive impairment in the previous generations . The three patients were born after uneventful pregnancies and had normal neonatal periods . None of them had psychiatric features and neurological examination always remained normal . Patient N09 2853 was 24 years old at the time of the study . Since the age of 7 months , seizures occurred in clusters Page 9 of 25 John Wiley & Sons , Inc .

There were one or two clusters per months , frequently favoured by hyperthermia . Brain MRI , at 5 years of age showed a frontal median dermoid cyst . She underwent resection of the cyst without any modification of seizure frequency . From the age of 9 years , the seizure semiology was modified , starting with a short yell or the repetition of a word related to the events of the previous days and followed by hyperactivity , fear , pallor and tachycardia . Consciousness was not altered during the shorter episodes . Clusters including more than 10 daily seizure episodes occurred over 2 to 3 days with intervals of 6 weeks to 3 months . They occurred mostly during daytime or as she fell asleep and were currently triggered by fever , emotions or sleep deprivation . She frequently experienced right frontal headache during the days preceding the seizures . At the age of 10 years , stereoencephalography showed rapid spikes followed by slow spike - waves in the left frontal cortex with contralateral propagation . The diagnosis of cryptogenic partial frontal epilepsy was considered . She has been treated with CBZ from the age of three years to the age of nineteen years in addition to other successive drugs ( VPA , VGB , LTG , TPM and LEV ) . Seizure offset occurred when she was 19 years old , as she was treated with CBZ and LEV , whose doses were then progressively decreased . Neuropsychological testing , at the age of 16 years showed a VIQ score of 115 and a PIQ score of 87 with slight impairment in working memory and visual treatment . She is now 23 years old and is attending the courses of French engineering school . Patient N09 2265 was one year younger than her sister . She experienced a first cluster of GTCS lasting one hour , when she was five years old , 12 hours after a febrile episode . At 6 years , she had two similar clusters favoured by hyperthermia as well as several afebrile nocturnal episodes . Neuropsychological testing , when she was 7 years old showed a VIQ score of 117 . She continued to experience repeated clusters of seizures with a modified semiology including automatic gestures , chewing and elevation of the left arm . Seizures were mainly triggered by fever . Some nocturnal tonic - clonic seizures also occurred . She was first treated with VPA , which was substituted with CBZ at the age of 10 years . Treatment could be stopped 6 years later . Now aged 22 years , she attends the classes of a French engineering school as her sister . The youngest sister ( N09 2851 ) was 15 at the time of the study . Since 9 months of age , she experienced clusters of GTCS during febrile episodes as well as nocturnal seizures with a semiology consisting of straightening up of the body , incoherent language , hypertonia with hand contractions , deviation of the head ( mainly on the right ) , chewing and bruxism . Seizure semiology was progressively modified with staring , back dropping and yelling , clonic Page 10 of 25 John Wiley & Sons , Inc .

EEG was in favour of a possible fronto - temporal origin . She has first been treated with CBZ . LTG was added when she was 7 years old and CBZ was switched to LEV two years later . Seizure offset occurred at 13 years of age . When seen for the last time , she was attending normal school although she displays slight reduced processing speed . She has won several championships of bridge . Family 4 , of French origin , included 3 female patients who all had GTCS but detailed clinical data were available for the proband only ( N09 0418 ) . She was born after uneventful pregnancy and had a normal development before the onset of seizures . She experienced a first brief generalized febrile seizure at 13 months . Two weeks later , she had a cluster of brief GTCS without fever and a treatment by VPA and Clonazepam ( CLN ) was started . At the age of 3 years , she had several generalized seizures in clusters . Seizures were brief ( < 2 minutes ) but repeated over several days ( 3 - 4 days ) . Afterwards , she had occasional episodes of GTCS occurring in cluster , which were commonly triggered by fever and lasted one or two minutes or even only a few seconds . VPA was replaced by TPM for a better control of the seizures . She never had myoclonia or partial seizures . At the age of 6 year , her language was delayed but she was able to make simple sentences . She was described as an introverted child , who had difficulties to establish social interactions . She was capable of communicating with words but did not use language spontaneously . For instance , she preferred pointing at objects or images rather than naming them . When examined for the last time , at 7 years old , she had a mild cognitive and language delay . Her mother was reported to have generalized seizures between age 2 and 6 years , that were first treated by PB and later on by VPA . At that time , polyspike - wave discharges were observed on EEGs . At the age of 18 years , she became free of seizures without treatment . However , when examined at age 44 , she presented with mild intellectual disability . The half - sister of the proband had 3 “Grand Mal” seizures at the age of 5 years old without fever . She became free of seizures when treated with VPA . However , during the adolescence , she presented with important scholar difficulties and psychiatric instability . Family 12 includes two affected sisters born from non consanguineous parents of French origin . Both sisters have had intra - uterine growth retardation related to a homozygous variant of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene in the mother . However , they were considered healthy full - term newborns . The proband ( N08 0696 ) , who Page 11 of 25 John Wiley & Sons , Inc .

She had about 10 febrile GTCS lasting a few minutes the same day with normal examination in - between , normal interictal EEG and normal brain MRI . Another series of afebrile paroxysmal events , characterized by numerous absences without abnormal movements lasting less than a minute , occurred one week later despite the initiation of VPA therapy . CLB was therefore added to VPA . Three more clusters of 5 - 10 seizures occurred at the ages of 2 , 3 and 4 years , requiring an add - on treatment with LTG . The clinical manifestations were heterogeneous , including absences , clonic and tonic seizures , sometimes associated with eyes turning . Most seizures lasted 1 to 5 minutes , but clusters of 10 to 15 minute - long seizures were also observed . Interictal EEGs remained normal except for occasional posterior slow waves . At the age of 3 . 5 years , psychomotor retardation and language delay became evident . She also had a mild microcephaly ( - 2 SD ) . The youngest sister ( N 09 1103 ) was 2 . 5 years old at the time of the study . She had a first cluster of ~ 10 afebrile GTCS at 8 . 5 months , leading to a treatment by VPA . Brain MRI was normal and interictal EEG revealed bitemporal slow waves but no paroxysmal activity . Another seizure cluster occurred a few days later and VGB was added to VPA . Two more episodes of 8 - 10 afebrile seizures occurred at the age of 21 months and were characterized by generalized tonic manifestations , sometimes asymmetrical with head turning , lasting a few minutes . EEG recording of a seizure showed generalized discharges from the beginning of the seizure . After replacement of VGB by TPM , no other seizures occurred . Her psychomotor development was slightly retarded , as she sat alone at 13 months , walked independently at 18 , but her speech ability was relatively preserved at the age of 2 . Her head growth followed the - 2 SD curve until 6 months then slowed down to - 2 . 5 / - 3 SD . Family 17 was of French origin and included a single affected female patient ( N07 0897 ) who was 7 years old at the time of the study . Her parents were reported to be healthful and there was no further history of febrile seizures or epilepsy in the family . The proband was born after an uneventful pregnancy and had a normal development before the onset of seizures . At 15 months , while she was febrile , she started having clusters of brief generalized tonic seizures that required hospitalization . A treatment by VPA was set up but tonic seizures lasting 2 - 3 minutes and repeating during several days recurred at 19 months in a febrile context . Despite the successive introduction of multiple AEDs ( CLB , TPM , PB and PHT ) , brief hypertonic seizures occurring in clusters persisted over time . An Page 12 of 25 John Wiley & Sons , Inc .

At 5 years old , she had a normal neurologic examination but showed a global developmental delay predominating in language and learning ( estimated to a one - year delay ) . The proband of family 18 was born at 36 weeks from a bichorionic gemellar pregnancy . Her parents , her twin sister and a youngest sister were all healthy . Her psychomotor development was normal until the onset of seizures . She experienced a first afebrile generalized convulsive status epilepticus at the age of 14 months . Investigations including brain imaging , lumbar puncture , toxic and metabolic screenings were normal . EEG was normal . She was treated with CLN and VPA . She started walking at 16 months , almost two months after her twin sister . She had new episodes of febrile GTCS at 1 . 5 , 2 . 5 and 3 . 5 years . Behavioural disturbances and language delay became obvious around 3 years old . A decrease in CLN dosage at the age of 4 years led to a new status epilepticus and LTG was added to CLN and VPA . Likewise , a decrease in VPA dosage at the age of 5 years was unsuccessful . From the age of 5 years , she had several clusters of GTC seizures , most of them triggered by mild fever . At the age of 7 years , she had a moderate cognitive impairment including a global executive dysfunction . Karyotyping was normal and search for X - Fragile expansion was negative . Diurnal and nocturnal EEGs and Brain MRI remained normal . A novel attempt to decrease CLN dosage at 7 years led to the recurrence of afebrile seizures in clusters . CLN was replaced by CLB . At the time of the study ( 11 years ) , she was free of seizures since age 9 on tritherapy ( VPA , CLB , TPM ) . She was able to read and her language appeared normal . However , she had major behavioural and personality disturbances . She also had difficulties with logical reasoning and graphics . She never had ataxia or myoclonic jerks and her seizures were photoinsensitive . Page 13 of 25 John Wiley & Sons , Inc .

We also tested 37 male patients in this study but no mutation was found . However , we cannot exclude that mosaicism has been missed by screening only DNA extracted from blood cells in these patients . Although all the previously reported mutations were clustered in exon 1 of PCDH19 ( corresponding to the extra - cellular cadherin domain of protocadherin 19 ) ( Depienne , et al . , 2009 ; Dibbens , et al . , 2008 ; Hynes , et al . , 2009 ) , we now report a nonsense mutation in exon 4 ( p . Arg886X ) that segregated in several affected members of family 1 . This shows that the PCDH19 mutational spectrum is not limited to mutations in exon 1 . Furthermore , two whole gene deletions and one partial deletion were identified using quantitative real - time PCR . These deletions constitute the first micro - rearrangements involving PCDH19 identified in female patients with febrile seizures and epilepsy . Altogether , these results confirm that mutations in PCDH19 are associated with a loss - of - function of protocadherin 19 in cells that have inactivated the normal X chromosome , and that screening of PCDH19 should include a specific method to search for rearrangements in addition to direct sequencing of the whole coding sequence . As previously reported , the phenotype of the patients with PCDH19 mutations was highly variable between families but also within affected members of a same family ( Table 2 ) . This variability includes the age at onset ( mean age at onset : 16 months , ranging from 7 months to 5 years ) , the occurrence of status epilepticus episodes ( 42 % , 10 / 24 ) , the response to AEDs ( pharmacoresistance in 76 % of the cases , 19 / 25 ) and the temporal evolution of the patients . However , seizures occurring in cluster ( 92 % , 23 / 25 patients ) and a high sensitivity to fever ( 90 % , 20 / 22 patients ) were almost invariably present in PCDH19 - positive patients . All patients have had generalized seizures ( although in some cases , the generalized seizures were only in febrile contexts ) and 68 % exhibited multiple seizure types ( 17 / 25 ) including partial seizures ( of frontal or temporal origin ) and atypical absences . Although seizures appeared highly resistant to AEDs during the first years of life , the frequency and pharmacoresistance of seizures tended to decrease over time , and some patients were even free of seizures during adolescence or adulthood on monotherapy . Myoclonic jerks were infrequent in patients with PCDH19 mutations ( 9 % , 2 / 23 ) and photosensitivity was reported in only one case out of 25 ( < 5 % ) . In contrast , a high frequency of behavioral disturbances , including autistic features , was noticeable ( 28 % , 7 / 25 patients ) . In some patients , social withdrawal or personality troubles were even the most prominent and disabling feature when the children became Page 14 of 25 John Wiley & Sons , Inc . Human Mutation 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 F o r P e e r R e v i e w 14 < Depienne et al . > older . Interestingly , the phenotypes of the patients with PCDH19 deletions seemed indistinguishable from those with point mutations although this finding needs to be confirmed with a larger number of patients carrying deletions . Intellectual deficiency was also very variable from one patient to another : cognitive impairment was reported to be mild in 6 patients , moderate in 10 , and moderate / severe in 2 patients . One patient was too young to evaluate her cognitive status ( family 7 ) . Interestingly , in families 1 and 2 , most or all patients presented without cognitive impairment . In family 2 for instance , all the 3 sisters with the p . Thr146Arg mutation had normal cognitive abilities . The history of epilepsy in the 3 sisters was nevertheless similar to other patients with moderate mental retardation and included in particular many seizures in cluster during childhood , persistence of the seizures despite polytherapy and later development of partial seizures of frontal or temporal origin . This highly suggests that the cognitive prognosis is not related to the severity of epilepsy . In family 1 , the history of febrile and afebrile seizures in the proband , her mother and her grand - mother was highly suggestive of Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures plus ( or Genetic Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures plus , GEFS + , MIM # 604233 ) ( Scheffer and Berkovic , 1997 ) . It is unclear so far whether the favorable cognitive outcome in these patients is due to the mutation itself , which could have milder functional consequences on the protocadherin 19 . The large intrafamilial variability of the phenotype ( in particular in family 1 ) however suggests that other genetic or non genetic modifier factors could be involved as well . One attractive hypothesis is that this phenotypic variability could be due to random or skewed X inactivation . Cellular interference is based on the random X inactivation resulting in a functional mosaicism in females ( Compagni , et al . , 2003 ; Depienne , et al . , 2009 ; Johnson , 1980 ; Wieland , et al . , 2004 ) . A totally skewed X inactivation in neurons would theoretically leads to a homogenous cell population ( expressing or not the normal protocadherin 19 ) , corresponding to a non - pathogenic situation . It is possible that a partially skewed X inactivation ( such as 60 : 40 , 70 : 30 or 80 : 20 ) could represent situations less severe than a random X inactivation ( 50 : 50 ) where the cellular interference is expected to be the highest . The severity of the epilepsy could therefore be correlated with the relative amount of inactivated neurons for each chromosome in the brain and some mutation carriers , like mutated mothers in family 13 and 14 for example , could even be asymptomatic due to totally skewed X inactivation .

It is now well - established that SCN1A mutations are associated with a large clinical spectrum ranging from febrile seizures only to typical or atypical Dravet syndrome ( Depienne , et al . , 2010 ; Harkin , et al . , 2007 ) . We have previously reported that the similarity between PCDH19 and SCN1A clinical spectra comprises Dravet syndrome ; now , we show that it also extends to that of GEFS + . Indeed , intellectual disability as well as partial epilepsy can also be part of SCN1A - positive GEFS + families ( Depienne , et al . , 2010 ; Escayg , et al . , 2000 ) . Differentiating one condition to the other would therefore be difficult in some cases . However , some clinical features could help prioritizing the analysis : for instance female patients with an age at onset after 12 months and presenting with seizure clusters should be first screened for PCDH19 mutations , especially when the families include several females but no male patients . Regarding Dravet Syndrome , screening for PCDH19 mutations should be performed for female patients when analysis of SCN1A ( including a method searching for SCN1A micro - rearrangements ) is negative . Given the unusual mode of inheritance and the wide phenotypic variability associated with PCDH19 , genetic counseling appears delicate . In the case of mutations inherited from an asymptomatic father , all the daughters are expected to be affected . Therefore , taking into account the frequent bad cognitive prognosis , it could be possible to offer a prenatal diagnosis using only a fetal sex determination from maternal blood ( Wright and Burton , 2009 ) . Female patients with PCDH19 mutations have a 50 % risk to transmit the mutation but only the females would be affected , for a global risk of 25 % . However , in some situations , genetic counseling could be even more difficult , such as in family 17 in which the proband had a PCDH19 deletion encompassing other nearby genes with a recessive X - linked inheritance such as SRPX2 . In that case , the patient will have a 25 % risk to have an affected daughter and of a 25 % risk to have a son affected with a phenotype of variable severity including rolandic epilepsy , oral and speech dyspraxia , mental retardation and perisylvian polymicrogyria . In conclusion , these results extend the mutational and clinical spectra associated with PCDH19 - related epilepsies and show that mutations in PCDH19 are a frequent cause of epilepsy in females and should be considered even in absence of family history and / or mental retardation .
