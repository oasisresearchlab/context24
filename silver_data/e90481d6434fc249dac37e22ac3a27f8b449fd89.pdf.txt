DeJager , MD , PhD IMPORTANCE Parkinsonian motor signs are common in the aging population and are associated with adverse health outcomes . Compared with Parkinson disease ( PD ) , potential genetic risk factors for mild parkinsonian signs have been largely unexplored . OBJECTIVE To determine whether PD susceptibility loci are associated with parkinsonism or substantia nigra pathology in a large community - based cohort of older persons . DESIGN , SETTING , ANDPARTICIPANTS Eighteencandidatesingle - nucleotidepolymorphisms from PD genome - wide association studies were evaluated in a joint clinicopathologic cohort . Participants included 1698 individuals and a nested autopsy collection of 821 brains from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project , 2 prospective community - based studies . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were a quantitative measure of global parkinsonism or component measures of bradykinesia , rigidity , tremor , and gait impairment that were based on the motor Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale . In secondary analyses , we examined associations with additional quantitative motor traits and postmortem indices , including substantia nigra Lewy bodies and neuronal loss . RESULTS Parkinson disease risk alleles in the MAPT ( rs2942168 ; P = . 0006 ) and CCDC62 ( rs12817488 ; P = . 004 ) loci were associated with global parkinsonism , and these associations remained after exclusion of patients with a PD diagnosis . Based on motor Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale subscores , MAPT ( P = . 0002 ) and CCDC62 ( P = . 003 ) were predominantly associated with bradykinesia , and we further discovered associations between SREBF1 ( rs11868035 ; P = . 005 ) and gait impairment , SNCA ( rs356220 ; P = . 04 ) and rigidity , and GAK ( rs1564282 ; P = . 03 ) and tremor . In the autopsy cohort , only NMD3 ( rs34016896 ; P = . 03 ) was related to nigral neuronal loss , and no associations were detected with Lewy bodies . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In addition to the established link to PD susceptibility , our results support a broader role for several loci in the development of parkinsonian motor signs and nigral pathology in older persons .

P arkinson disease ( PD ) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive rest tremor , bradykine - sia , rigidity , and gait impairment ; these motor symp - toms are collectively referred to as parkinsonism . 1 At autopsy , PD pathology consists of α - synuclein protein inclu - sions , termed Lewy bodies , within the midbrain substantia nigra and associated degeneration of dopaminergic neurons . Data 2 - 4 suggest that nigral Lewy bodies and neuronal loss are also related to mild parkinsonian signs among persons with - out PD . In addition , clinical parkinsonism , which follows dis - ruption of nigrostriatal pathways controlling movement , 5 can also be associated with other common age - related neu - ropathologies , including cerebrovascular lesions 6 , 7 and Alz - heimer disease . 8 In fact , the manifestation of mild parkinso - nian signs is common in older individuals , having been reported 9 - 11 to occur in up to 50 % of some cohorts . Further - more , mild parkinsonian signs are associated with sub - stantial morbidity , 12 , 13 including risk of mild cognitive impairment , 14 dementia , 15 , 16 and mortality 11 ; therefore , understanding the causes and risk factors are an important public health goal . Genome - wide association studies ( GWASs ) 17 - 20 have suc - cessfully identified several common susceptibility loci for PD , and we investigated whether these alleles more broadly affect mild parkinsonian motor signs or nigral pathology in older persons . Our study was based on the hypothesis that overlapping genetic mechanisms may be responsible for PD , other causes of nigrostriatal pathology , and perhaps addi - tional determinants of motor impairment that present as parkinsonism . We leveraged data from the Religious Orders Study ( ROS ) 21 and Rush Memory and Aging Project ( MAP ) , 22 2 complementary , community - based cohort studies of aging combining prospective , longitudinal clinical evaluations with brain donation at death . We found that 2 PD suscepti - bility loci , MAPT ( OMIM 157140 ) and CCDC62 ( OMIM 613481 ) , are associated with global parkinsonism , and sev - eral others are associated with discrete parkinsonian fea - tures or additional motor traits , suggesting a broader effect on age - related motor impairment in the population . Unex - pectedly , although variants at NMD3 ( OMIM 611021 ) were related to substantia nigra neuronal loss , none of the PD loci showed associations with nigral Lewy bodies . Methods Participants and Clinical Evaluations Study participants from ROS 21 and MAP 22 did not have a diag - nosis of dementia at enrollment , agreed to annual clinical evaluations , and signed an informed consent and an Ana - tomic Gift Act form to donate their brains at death . They did not receive financial compensation . The studies were ap - proved by the institutional review board of Rush University MedicalCenter . Atotalof1698individuals ( ROS , 810 , andMAP , 888 ) withgenotypingdatawereavailableforanalysesofglobal parkinsonism , andthenestedautopsycohortincluded821par - ticipants at the time of these analyses . The ROS 21 and MAP 22 participants received a uniform structured clinical evalua - tionthatincludesmedicalhistory , neurologicexamination , and neuropsychologicalperformancetests . DiagnosisofPD ( n = 46 ) was based on self - reported history , including L - dopa treat - mentatanytimebeforeorduringthestudy . 2 Parkinsonismwas assessedbytrainednursesatstudyentryandwasbasedon26 itemsfromamodifiedversionofthemotorsectionoftheUni - fied Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale ( mUPDRS ) . 23 Four pre - viouslyestablishedparkinsoniansignscores ( bradykinesia , ri - gidity , tremor , and gait disturbance ) were derived from these 26 items , and a summary global parkinsonian sign score was constructed by averaging these 4 scores , as detailed in prior publications . 2 , 23 Clinical evaluations also included testing of upper and lower extremity motor function , including quanti - tative assessments of gait ( time and number of steps to walk 2 . 4mandturn360° ) , Purduepegboard , andfingertapping , as previously described . 7 , 12 Postmortem Procedures Themean ( SD ) postmortemintervalwas8 . 3 ( 7 . 4 ) hours . Aspart of comprehensive neuropathologic evaluations , diagnostic blocks were dissected from the midbrain , including the sub - stantia nigra . 24 Nigral neuronal loss was assessed in the sub - stantia nigra in the mid to rostral midbrain near or at the exit ofthethirdnerveusinghematoxylin - eosinstainand6 - μmsec - tions using a semiquantitative scale ( 0 - 3 ) . 2 Lewy bodies were identifiedwithantibodiestoα - synucleinusingalkalinephos - phataseasthechromogen . 24 AtissuediagnosisofPDwasbased on the presence of nigral Lewy bodies and moderate or se - vere nigral neuronal loss . 25 Postmortem indices of Alzheimer disease pathology and cerebrovascular disease were col - lected as previously described . 6 , 26 Genotyping and Single - Nucleotide Polymorphisms Genome - widegenotypingandquality - controlprocedureshave been reported . 27 Genotype imputation was performed using BEAGLEsoftware , version3 . 3 . 2 ( http : / / faculty . washington . edu / browning / beagle / beagle . html ) . We used reference haplo - type panels from 87 Centre d’Etude du Polymorphisme Hu - main individuals of Northern European ancestry in the 1000 Genomes Project ( 1000 Genomes Project Consortium interim phaseIhaplotypes , 2010 - 2011datafreeze ) . 28 , 29 Forselectionof candidate single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , we ini - tiallyconsultedthePDGenewebsite ( http : / / www . pdgene . org ) , 30 which performs meta - analyses of available GWAS data and ranks susceptibility loci with the strongest statistical evi - dence of association . The available PDGene meta - analysis results were last updated in November 2011 ; therefore , a select number of additional candidate SNPs were supple - mented based on published studies . 17 - 20 All of the PD sus - ceptibility loci evaluated in this study have been reported to have genome - wide significant associations with PD ( P < 5 × 10 −8 ) in case - control studies . 17 - 20 In our imputed data set , we did not have confident estimates of genotypes for SNPs at the MMP16 ( chr8 : 89442157 ) or SYT11 - GBA ( chr1 : 154105678 ) loci , so these were excluded from our analyses . The list of SNPs , reference alleles , frequency in our study cohort , and relevant references are included in the Supple - ment ( eTable 1 and eReferences ) .

Our primary analyses examined the association of SNPs with the quantitativesummarymeasureofglobalparkinsonismorthe componentparkinsoniansigns ( bradykinesia , gait , rigidity , and tremor ) . LinearregressionmodelswereusedtorelateSNPswith globalparkinsonismaswellasthequantitativemeasuresofbra - dykinesia and gait ; the scaled outcomes were square root – transformed to better approximate the assumptions of nor - mality . Logisticregressionwasusedforanalysesoftremorand rigidity . Unadjusted P values are presented throughout ; P < . 0028 was considered significant after adjusting for mul - tiple hypothesis testing ( α = . 05 divided by 18 SNPs ) . Because this correction for multiple tests is conservative and each of these susceptibility polymorphisms has been independently validatedasaPDsusceptibilitylocus , weadditionallyconsid - ered an unadjusted value of P < . 05 as suggestive evidence of association in our analyses . Secondary analyses included ad - ditional clinical motor traits and postmortem indices , as de - scribed above . Linear regression was used for all quantitative motoroutcomes ( Purduepegboard , fingertaps , gaitspeed , gait steps , turn speed , and turn steps ) . Consistent with prior studies , 2 , 6 for analyses of postmortem indices , linear regres - sionwasusedforglobalAlzheimerdiseasepathology , andlo - gisticregressionwasusedtoevaluatetheextentofnigralneu - ronalloss ( ordinal ) , thepresenceofnigralLewybodies , orthe presenceofmacroscopicormicroscopicinfarcts . Allanalyses were adjusted for patient age ( baseline or death ) and sex . Results There were 1698 participants with baseline assessments of global parkinsonism and available genotyping included in our primary analysis . The distribution , quality , and severity of parkinsonian signs were previously reported for the ROS and MAP cohorts . 2 , 23 Demographic and clinical characteris - tics for the study cohort are reported in Table 1 . Eighteen SNPs were selected on the basis of prior identification of PD susceptibility loci from GWAS meta - analyses ( Supplement [ eTable 1 ] ) . 30 Association of PD Susceptibility Variants With Parkinsonism We evaluated the 18 PD risk variants with global parkinson - ismatbaselineevaluations ( Table2 ) , aquantitativesummary measure of parkinsonian motor features based on the mUPDRS . We found MAPT ( rs2942168 ; P = . 0006 ) to be sig - nificantly associated with parkinsonism , and another locus , CCDC62 ( rs12817488 ; P = . 004 ) , was suggestively associated . The observed associations between baseline global parkin - sonismandboth MAPT ( P = . 0004 ) and CCDC62 ( P = . 004 ) re - mainedafterexcluding46participantswithaclinicaldiagno - sisofPD ( Supplement [ eTable2 ] ) , suggestingthatourfindings are driven by the mild parkinsonian signs broadly ascer - tained in the cohort . Surprisingly , the direction of effects for the associations with global parkinsonism in our cohort was opposite from that reported for association with PD suscepti - bility . Specifically , rs2942168 A and rs12817488 G , at MAPT and CCDC62 , respectively , wereassociatedwithincreasedparkin - sonism at baseline assessments in our cohorts ( Supplement [ eFigure 1 ] ) , whereas these alleles were protective against PD in other published studies . 18 , 30 Although recognized as a distinct syndrome , the clinical manifestationsofparkinsonismareoftenheterogeneous . For example , tremor - and gait - predominant forms of PD are recognized , 31 and it has been suggested 32 that such heteroge - neity might be genetically encoded . We therefore also evalu - ated associations between PD susceptibility loci and 4 dis - crete domains of motor impairment that comprise the global parkinsonism trait derived from the relevant components of the mUPDRS : bradykinesia , rigidity , tremor , and gait impair - ment ( Table 3 and Supplement [ eTable 3 ] ) . Both MAPT ( P = . 0002 ) and CCDC62 ( P = . 003 ) were predominantly asso - ciatedwithbradykinesiaatbaselinestudyevaluations . These analyses also implicated associations between other PD risk allelesandparkinsonianfeatures : SREBF1 wasassociatedwith gait impairment ( P = . 005 ) , SNCA with rigidity ( P = . 04 ) , and GAK with tremor ( P = . 03 ) . Therefore , the global parkinson - ism summary score may obscure more - selective genetic as - sociationswiththecomponentdomains . Similarto MAPT and Table1 .

Association of PD Susceptibility Variants With Nigral Pathology We next investigated whether PD susceptibility loci are asso - ciated with nigral pathology , including α - synuclein Lewy bodies and neuronal loss , which are characteristic of PD and also have been linked to parkinsonian motor signs in older persons without PD . 2 Among our study cohort , a subset of 821 deceased individuals was available with genotyping and a complete , uniform neuropathologic evaluation ( Table 1 ) . Interestingly , the NMD3 locus was related to the severity of nigral neuronal loss ( rs34016896 ; P = . 03 ) ( Table 5 ) based on semiquantitative assessment of pigmented dopaminergic neurons on hematoxylin - eosin – stained tissue sections from the midbrain . Surprisingly , none of the PD susceptibility loci showed associations with the presence of Lewy body pathol - ogy in the substantia nigra ( Supplement [ eTable 5 ] ) based on α - synuclein immunohistochemistry . The prevalence of nigral Lewy body pathology in our cohort ( 19 . 7 % ) is consistent with that seen in similar older community - based cohorts . 35 In addition to synuclein pathology , parkinsonism can result from other common neuropathologies , including Alzheimer disease 36 , 37 and cerebrovascular lesions . 6 However , PD risk alleles were associated with neither a quantitative measure of global Alzheimer disease pathology nor the presence of mac - roscopic or microscopic infarct pathology ( Supplement [ eTable 6 ] ) . Discussion Mildparkinsoniansignsarecommonintheagingpopulation , with estimates as high as 50 % in persons older than 85 years basedonthecohortstudiedandthedefinitionused . 9 - 11 These signsarenotbenign ; theirseverityisassociatedwithsubstan - tialmorbidity , 12 , 13 includingcognitivedecline , 14 dementia , 15 , 16 and risk of death . 11 In an effort to expand our understanding of risk factors for parkinsonian signs , we investigated 18 ge - neticvariantsimplicatedinPDsusceptibilityforlinkswithpar - kinsonism in 2 large community - based cohorts . Our findings suggest that several loci , including MAPT and CCDC62 , may have a broader role in age - related motor impairment in the populationbeyondtheirestablishedconnectiontoPD . Analy - ses of individual parkinsonian features and related quantita - tive motor measures implicated several additional loci , in - cluding GAK , SREBF1 , and SNCA . Althoughmildclinicalsigns have been described in otherwise healthy carriers of domi - nantmutationsinfamilieswithmendelianPD , 38 toourknowl - edge , genetic risk factors for mild parkinsonian signs in the broaderpopulationhavenotpreviouslybeenreported . Insum , our findings begin to reveal the genetic architecture of mild parkinsonian signs and point to an overlap with determi - nants of PD susceptibility . Comparedwiththepublished 17 - 20 , 30 effectsonPDrisk , we found an opposite direction of effect for several variants on global parkinsonism in our cohort . There are several poten - tial explanations for this unexpected result . First , compared with PD GWASs , our cohort was distinguished by older par - ticipants , community - based recruitment , and a prospective study design . In fact , patients manifesting mild parkinsonian signsinourcohortwerenearly20yearsolder , onaverage , than thetypicalcasesincludedinPDGWASs . 18 Thus , ifagivenvari - ant is associated with accelerated PD clinical manifestation , recruitmentofanolder , largelyneurologicallyhealthysample mayexcludesuchalleles , leadingtoanapparentopposite , pro - tective effect . Simulations have demonstrated 39 that similar effectreversalscanarisefromgeneinteractioneffectsafterdis - tortion of allele frequencies of unknown interacting variants . AnotherpotentialcontributormightbethattheproxySNPsun - derconsiderationareinincompletelinkagedisequilibriumwith thetruecausalvariants . 40 Finally , althoughglobalparkinson - ism in our cohort and PD diagnosis were assessed using simi - lar metrics ( mUPDRS ) , these traits may have divergent ge - netic architectures . For example , mild parkinsonian signs in theolderpopulationarelikelytobemorepathologicallyhetero - geneous than are those for PD . Few individuals ( 1 . 1 % ) in our cohort carried a diagnosis of PD , and these patients could be excludedfromtheanalysiswithoutsignificantlyaffectingthe results . Thus , althoughourfindingssuggestanintriguingover - lap between genetic risk for PD and parkinsonism , additional studies will be required to understand the mechanisms re - sponsible for this association . Althoughthedevelopmentofparkinsonism , includingmild parkinsonian signs , is not specific for a particular pathologic process , the clinical manifestations have traditionally been neuroanatomically linked to dysfunction in nigrostriatal pathways . 5 Parkinsonisminourcohort , similartothatinother clinicopathologic studies , has been associated with PD - related α - synuclein pathology 2 , 41 as well as Alzheimer dis - easepathologicchanges 36 , 37 andbraininfarctburden . 6 Wehy - pothesized that such heterogeneous brain lesions might similarlyresultindopaminergicneuronaldysfunctionand / or lossandthedevelopmentofparkinsonianmotorsigns . InROS and MAP , for example , a previous study 2 showed that the as - sociationofLewybodypathologyandglobalparkinsonismcan be statistically mediated by nigral neuronal loss . However , in the present study , neither of the loci identified in association with parkinsonism ( MAPT and CCDC62 ) showed evidence of an association with nigral neuronal loss in our sample of 821 autopsies . Of the other PD risk alleles , only NMD3 was asso - ciated with nigral neurodegeneration , and none of the evalu - ated SNPs was associated with nigral Lewy bodies , Alzhei - Table5 .

In a prior study , 42 the MAPT H1haplotypeshowedevidenceofanasso - ciationwithcorticalLewybodypathology ; however , thestudy cohort is difficult to compare with the ROS / MAP cohort be - causeitwaslargelyfromaclinic - basedpopulationsamplewith dementia , and nigral Lewy bodies were not considered inde - pendently . Surprisingly , although the PD - associated H1 hap - lotype tag SNP at MAPT , rs2942168 , was significantly associ - atedwithglobalparkinsonism , itwasnotassociatedwithnigral pathology in our cohort . Statistical power may be limited in the reduced sample size of the autopsy cohort , and it is also possible that our current neuropathologic procedures under - estimate the true anatomic extent of Lewy bodies and spec - trum of nigral neuronal loss , hindering our capability to de - tectsuchassociations . Furthermore , itisnowrecognizedthat α - synucleinpathologyisfoundthroughouttheneuraxisinPD affecting the autonomic ganglia , spinal cord , brainstem , lim - bic , andcorticalregions . 43 Itispossiblethatmorecomprehen - sive characterization of such widespread neuropathologic changesmightallowthedetectionofgeneticassociationswith thenervoussystemlesionsunderlyingmildparkinsoniansigns . Strengthsofourstudyincludethecommunity - based , pro - spectivecohortdesignandsystematiccollectionofclinicaland pathologic data . Although our analyses included nearly 1700 participants and more than 800 brains in the autopsy cohort , thesesamplesarenotlargeenoughtodefinitivelyexcludeas - sociations with global parkinsonism or nigral pathology . Ad - ditional potential limitations include an older population , which might limit generalizability to the broader adult popu - lation . We also did not consider less common or rare variant susceptibilityfactorsforPD , suchastheestablishedpolymor - phisms at LRRK2 and GBA , which will be an important future area of investigation . It will also be essential to replicate and confirmourfindingsinadditionalcommunity - andpopulation - based cohorts with a similar collection of clinical and neuro - pathologic data . Conclusions Our results suggest that PD susceptibility loci may have a broadereffectonthedevelopmentofparkinsonianmotorsigns in older individuals . Larger sample sizes will enable future meta - analyses with improved power to reveal additional ge - netic risk factors for mild parkinsonian signs and related pa - thology in the aging population .
