The Emergence of Organizations and Markets John F . Padgett and Walter W . Powell Princeton University Press Princeton & oxford Padgett _ FINAL . indb 3 7 / 20 / 12 8 : 42 AM 2 Autocatalysis in Chemistry and the Origin of Life John F . Padgett the purpose of this chapter is to provide back - ground to social scientists on the concept of autocatalysis , drawn from chemistry and the literature on the origins of life . More compre - hensive , though less focused , reviews of the early history of life from different theoretical perspec - tives are provided in eigen , in Maynard smith and szathmáry , and in Margulis and sagan . 1 the literature on the origin of life is tumultuous , much like the history of biological life itself . the placid and comforting image of Darwin’s warm tidal pool as the physical locus for the first emer - gence of chemical life has been partly replaced ( or at least challenged ) in the current literature by violent volcanoes and thermal vents . the even more violent crashing of venus - and Mars - sized proto - planets to create our earth and its moon lies in the background of these early crescive volcanoes , which may have helped power early evolution . obviously academic disputes do not compare in degree of violence to this , but much heat and constructive energy has been gener - ated by an ongoing theoretical struggle between the rnA - first position , which places all its ex - planatory emphasis on the self - organization of nucleic acids , and the metabolism - first position , which focuses on the self - organization of sim - pler energy - processing chemistries that rnA and DnA later regulated and reproduced . A minority position insists that lipid cell vesicles came first , which both types of chemistry came to inhabit . 1 eigen 1992 ; Maynard smith and szathmáry 1995 ; Mar - gulis and sagan 1995 . Perhaps the best popular treatment is capra 1996 . this literature review chapter cannot adjudi - cate these highly technical disputes , even though its assumption will be that all three contending positions have something valuable to contribute . its purpose is more modest : to point out that the concept of autocatalysis lies at the founda - tion of all of these positions . the three schools of thought do not dispute the foundational im - portance of the concept of autocatalysis to the definition and emergence of life . they just dis - pute exactly which were the primary chemicals and chemical reactions involved in early autoca - talysis . if the concept of autocatalysis ever suc - ceeds in its transposition to the social sciences , we likewise can anticipate fruitful contention about exactly which types and combinations of autocatalysis are applicable to which historical episodes of organizational transformation . this chapter proceeds in four sections : first , a definitional overview of the problem ; second , a selective review of the current chemical litera - ture on the origin of life ; third , a brief review of formal modeling in this area ; and finally a section on autopoiesis , the first not entirely suc - cessful attempt to transpose the concept of auto - catalysis to the social sciences . i conclude with some remarks about Harrison White and Wil - liam sewell Jr . , on whose work we build . DEFInITIOnS OF ChEMICAL AuTOCATALYSIS AnD LIFE the motivating puzzle for everyone who studies the origin of life on earth is that life arose very Padgett _ FINAL . indb 33 7 / 20 / 12 8 : 42 AM 34 ■ Chapter 2 quickly , in geological time . the core facts , as de - scribed by Martin and russell , 2 are these : the earth is 4 . 5 billion years ( Gyr ) old , and the first ocean had condensed by ca . 4 . 4 Gyr . there are good reasons to believe that life arose here by ca . 3 . 8 Gyr , because carbon isotope data provide evidence for biological co 2 fixation in sedimentary rocks of that age . By 3 . 5 Gyr , stromatolites were pres - ent , preserved microbial mats indicative of deposition by photosynthetic prokaryotes . 3 By ca . 1 . 5 Gyr , so - called acritarchs became reasonably abundant , microfossils of uni - cellular organisms that are almost certainly eukaryotes and are probably algae because of an easily preserved cell wall . By 1 . 2 Gyr , spectacularly preserved multicellular organ - isms appear that were very probably red algae . in other words , as measured directly by fossils , life emerged about 20 percent of the way into the history of the earth . As measured indirectly by chemical traces , life emerged 15 percent of the way into the history of the earth . in such an early epoch , the originally molten earth was still quivering with volcanoes , left over from the gi - ant collision of its birth and subsequent meteor bombardments . Life emerged so early in the his - tory of the earth that the history of the earth it - self is shaped by the history of life upon it—for example , the earth’s atmosphere of oxygen , not to mention soil and oil . the definition of life is contested but only in the sense that authors differ as to how many of the following list of items to include in the definition : 1 . thermodynamic throughput of energy 2 . Autocatalysis or self - reproduction 3 . cellular enclosure 4 . evolution 2 Martin and russell 2003 , 59 – 60 include citations for each of their numbers . to place these numbers in comparative perspective , the universe is 13 . 7 billion years old ( Weintraub 2011 ) ; the sun is 4 . 6 Gyr ; the cambrian explosion , from which all animal phyla descend , is 0 . 53 Gyr ( Gould 1989 ; Morris 1998 ) ; and humans ( i . e . , homo sapiens ) arose . 0002 billion years ago . 3 Prokaryotes are simple single - celled bacteria , with no internal compartmentalization . eukaryotes are complex and larger single - celled bacteria with extensive internal differen - tiation , including mitochrondria and a nucleus . once aggre - gated , eukaryotes became cells in higher - level multicellular organisms . this list is almost hierarchical , in the natural - science sense of that term : 4 namely , items lower in the list are included within and presuppose items higher in the list . throughput of energy is required not just as fuel for chemical reactions but also for self - organization of any kind , defined thermodynam - ically as a decrease in entropy . Maximal entropy is defined as randomness in an ensemble ; hence decrease in entropy means increase in nonran - domness or order . 5 the second Law of ther - modynamics states that any ensemble that is energetically isolated will gradually decay into complete randomness and that any ensemble that is energetically coupled to only one reser - voir will gradually increase in entropy , going to equilibrium with its environmental reservoir . Material ensembles , in other words , gradually disintegrate and “die . ” the reason that living systems , which increase in order over develop - mental and evolutionary time , appear to violate the second Law of thermodynamics is through - put of energy . Here ensembles are attached to two reservoirs—an energy source from which order is drawn and an energy sink into which disorder is deposited . 6 throughput of energy in physical and chemical ensembles induces align - ment , patterning , or order into the elements of those ensembles . the earth itself is an ensemble experiencing a throughput of energy , since light from the sun during the day is radiated away as heat into outer space during the night . Prigogine has done mathematically the most to analyze these “far - from - equilibrium” throughput systems , which he has labeled “dissi - pative systems . ” 7 Morowitz added the important addendum that cycling is part of the “pattern” produced by steady - state energy throughput . 8 All authors treat the throughput of energy as 4 simon 1969 . 5 the formula for entropy—namely , s = – k∑ i p i ln e p i —is al - most identical to that for information in shannon - type infor - mation theory—namely , i = – ∑ s p s ln 2 p s . Hence many authors equate entropy with information , even though Morowitz ( 1992 , 74 , 126 ) warns against such switching between inter - pretative contexts . 6 no system violates the second Law if both source and sink are included in the definition of “ensemble . ” intermediate ensembles “defeat” the Law only through degrading the order in source into the disorder in sink . 7 Prigogine [ 1955 ] 1967 ; nicolis and Prigogine 1977 , 1989 . Prigogine won the nobel Prize in 1977 . the phrase far from equilibrium is potentially confusing for social scientists . in this context , it refers to thermodynamic equilibrium or dis - ordered “death . ” Steady state is the term physicists use instead of equilibrium when referring to stable and reproducible pat - terns generated by throughput . 8 Morowitz 1966 ; Morowitz 1968 , 29 – 33 . Padgett _ FINAL . indb 34 7 / 20 / 12 8 : 42 AM Autocatalysis in Chemistry ■ 35 a necessary precondition to life , but only a few of them treat this criterion as sufficient . 9 As Prigogine made clear , physical thermal convec - tion systems are ordered dissipative systems , without being alive . Autocatalytic systems are chemical dissipative systems with the criterion of self - reproduction added . the word chemical , unlike the word physical , implies transformation : elements inter - act not only by aligning with each other but also by changing each other . the most general defini - tion of self - reproduction is that which was dis - cussed in the introductory chapter to this book : “A set of nodes ( in this case chemicals ) whose 9 see schrödinger [ 1944 ] 1967 for a prescient analysis , be - fore DnA was discovered , based on thermodynamics . transformational interaction reproduces the nodes in the set . ” in the face of inevitable dissipa - tion and random decay in constituent chemical elements , chemical systems with the topology of autocatalysis have the potential ( realized under favorable kinetic circumstances ) to reconstruct their own lost components . in the steady - state case where energetic input equals energetic out - put , autocatalysis implies self - maintenance of the chemical network as a whole . At the micro level of individual chemicals , however , system self - maintenance is only achieved by the continual regeneration of the constituent chemicals to re - place those that have been lost . simple examples are given in figure 2 . 1 . self - repair of the system against perturbations that are not too severe is one corollary . if energy input exceeds energy A .

Padgett _ FINAL . indb 35 7 / 20 / 12 8 : 42 AM 38 ■ Chapter 2 chemical autocatalysis when coupled with a powering energy source and cellular enclosure leads naturally to cells that physically grow and eventually divide . Add a finite resource con - straint to growing and dividing cells , and Dar - win’s natural selection is induced . All then that is missing for evolution is variation , which could be random or could be structured . evolution , while not part of my and others’ definition of life , easily grows out of the lower items on the list , once a few auxiliary features are added . speed of evolution , however , is another mat - ter . it took about 70 percent of the earth’s his - tory before the early single - celled bacteria ever assembled into multicelled algae . And it took about 88 percent of the earth’s history before anything as recognizable as organized critters with body plans emerged . if we were reasoning halfway into the history of the earth , i’m not sure that the concept of evolution would have entered our minds . the inventions of sex and cell death 20 were late arrivals in the history of evolution , which sped up biological evolution enormously , perhaps analogous to the invention of language in human evolution . none of these later steps is explained by autocatalysis alone , but autocatalysis remains a critical processual building block in higher - order explanations of evolutionary and historical transformations . ThE ChEMICAL OrIgIn OF LIFE the details of biochemistry are incredibly com - plicated , even at the level of bacteria . Fortunately social scientists ( who deal with enough complex - ity already ) do not need to know those details in order to appreciate the structure and topology of the issues involved in the study of biological genesis . the questions asked in origins - of - life re - search are more useful to social scientists than of Species : “it is interesting to contemplate a tangled bank , clothed with many plants of many kinds , with birds singing on the bushes , with various insects flitting about , and with worms crawling through the damp earth , and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms , so different from each other , and dependent upon each other in so complex a man - ner , have all been produced by laws acting around us” ( Dar - win [ 1859 ] 1993 , 648 ) . competitive natural selection lies at the heart of Darwin’s laws , to be sure , but intraspecies com - petition is structured within a tangled web of interspecies eco - logical and chemical flows that in ensemble more accurately warrant the label of ( interdependent ) co - evolution than of ( autonomous ) evolution . 20 Bacteria can be killed , but they do not die if fed . Left to their own , they are immortal . Programmed death was an his - torical invention that imposed cell turnover and thus speeded evolution . are the specific answers generated in that sub - field because social scientists have their own ver - sions of these issues . the intellectual objective is to engage in interdisciplinary dialogue about challenging topics of interest to multiple disci - plines , not to copy or mimic in either direction . 21 Again Morowitz is useful to cut to the chase . Figure 2 . 3 reproduces two of his diagrams , which lay out in schematic overview the chemi - cal structures both of currently living biochem - istries and of posited primitive biochemistries . the generality is such that contending rnA - first and metabolism - first positions both can be ac - commodated . in currently living biochemical systems , metabolism generates amino acids and nucleobases ( among other things ) , which are 21 thanks again are due to the santa Fe institute , in par - ticular ellen Goldberg , erica Jen , and Walter Fontana , for en - couraging interdisciplinary dialogue across unusually distant disciplines .

How can anything be jump - started without the products produced by it ? in particular protein enzymes are very com - plicated macromolecules that control virtually all chemistries in living organisms , and these are created by even more complex strings of genes in DnA . Did Deus ex machina do all this ? the second diagram in figure 2 . 3 , represent - ing primitive biochemistry , simplifies the auto - catalysis problem without resolving it . instead of complicated macromolecules like DnA and protein enzymes , researchers currently imagine “low - efficiency catalysts” to get the earliest au - tocatalytic chemical system moving . A variety of candidates for the very first iterations of this primitive cycle have been proposed , but nearly everyone now agrees that sooner or later those low - efficiency catalysts were primitive , short - stringed rnA . this is called the “rnA world” hypothesis . 23 this hypothesis has become hegemonic in the field not because it solves everything but because it allows the simplification of the intractable top diagram in figure 2 . 3 into the “easier” bottom one . Prior to this simplification , DnA and protein enzymes both were considered enormously com - plicated macromolecules with various versions of rnA ( trnA , rrnA , mrnA , etc . ) 24 serving only the intermediating function of translating between these complex worlds . 25 that is because this is what they do today . But focusing on com - plicated DnA and proteins directly makes their 22 Food energy inputs and outputs are implicit but not shown . 23 the phrase is from Gilbert ( 1986 ) , who suggestively drew attention to and labeled path - breaking experiments by Altman and cech , which demonstrated catalytic produc - tion capacity for transfer rnA ( trnA ) and ribosomal rnA ( rrnA ) , respectively . thereby ribosomes became “ribo - zymes . ” two decades of experimental research on the rnA world since then are reviewed in orgel 2004 and Penny 2005 . i agree with Martin and russell ( 2003 , 64 ) that the label “rnA era” would have been more felicitous than “rnA world , ” in order to eliminate the connotation of a world be - ing self - contained . But it is too late for linguistic corrections like this . 24 http : / / en . wikipedia . org / wiki / List _ of _ rnAs . 25 Woese ( 2002 , 8745 ) suggestively emphasizes this “sym - bolic” or “linguistic” translation function of rnA between the DnA and protein worlds . He provocatively interprets the move from the bottom to the top diagrams in figure 2 . 3 as “the evolution of modern cells , then , had to begin with the onset of translation . ” emergence seem virtually impossible . in the sim - plified rnA world of the alleged past , however , plastic and multifunctional rnA molecules did double duty : both as DnA inheritance machines and as protein catalysts of chemical reactions in cells . that doesn’t mean that they did this very well , but over evolutionary time the “Darwin - eigen cycle” kicked in to induce greater spe - cialization and genome precision . 26 this positive feedback loop , which generates genome com - plexity , is the following : “selection increases [ rnA reproduction ] fidelity à larger genome size à new functionality evolving à selection increases fidelity . ” As my first item of business in the formal - modeling section of this chapter , i will review eigen’s hypercycle and quasi - species models , which are referenced here . Molecular - Darwinian conceptual frameworks like these tell us not much in detail about how evolution did it , but they give contemporary biochemists con - fidence ( justified or not ) that the transition from the bottom diagram in figure 2 . 3 to the top one is “just” a matter of Darwinian engineering . Most evolutionary biochemists think they understand that , in principle at least . 27 the hegemonic rnA - world hypothesis leaves open the question of how the bottom chemi - cal structure in figure 2 . 3 evolved . to their credit , both of the contending rnA - first and metabolism - first positions have been motivated by exciting empirical findings . simultaneous with the discovery of DnA , 28 the famous ex - periments by stanley Miller , 29 way back in the 1950s , set the origin - of - life agenda for the next thirty years . those experiments surprisingly generated amino acids just by sending electric sparks , which simulated lightning , through a gaseous mixture of methane , ammonia , hydro - gen , and vaporized water . these gases simulated the ideas of oparin and of Urey ( Miller’s teacher ) about the presumed reductive atmosphere of early earth . those experiments , together with laboratory syntheses of nucleobases , 30 gave 26 Poole , Jeffares , and Penny 1998 ; Poole , Jeffares , and Penny 1999 , 881 ; Penny 2005 , 641 . 27 Margulis 1967 , 1970 , Marulis and sagan 1995 , and Margulis and Dolan 2002 ; Woese 1998 , 2002 ; and shapiro 2011 inject informed and healthy doses of skepticism into this consensus . i discuss their views at the end of this section . 28 Watson and crick 1953 . one of the more famous con - clusions in science is their comment , “it has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immedi - ately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material . ” 29 Miller 1953 , 1955 , 1957 . 30 two decades of experiments are reviewed in Miller and orgel 1974 , 83 – 117 . oró and Kimball ( 1960 ) were the Padgett _ FINAL . indb 39 7 / 20 / 12 8 : 42 AM 40 ■ Chapter 2 empirical support to early pre - DnA hypoth - eses by oparin and Haldane , 31 and by Darwin himself , 32 about life emerging from a “prebiotic soup . ” Another glance at the bottom diagram in figure 2 . 3 illustrates why all of this experimental ferment consolidated the rnA - first theoretical position : 33 primitive biochemical catalysts might have polymerized spontaneously out of amino - acid ( à protein ) and / or nucleobase ( à rnA ) components , which then could have triggered metabolism in nearby energy - rich chemicals . 34 Alas , the exciting rnA - first position has con - fronted so far insuperable empirical difficulties , one of which is that no geochemist believes any - more the original assumption of oparin - Urey - Miller about the highly reductive atmosphere of early earth , which made the amino - acid experi - ments work so well . the consensus now is that the atmosphere on early earth was composed mostly of nitrogen , carbon dioxide , and water vapor with a little bit of chemically more active carbon monoxide and methane possibly thrown in as non - steady - state transients from the moon - forming impact . 35 For a couple of decades , this stubborn fact about the early atmosphere threw into question the optimistic assumption of the rnA - first school that synthesizing amino - acid and nucleobase components of proteins and rnA , respectively , was easy . 36 first to synthesize nucleobases . the Miller and orgel book reported with considerable optimism on the state of the field and hopes of researchers in 1974 . even in 1974 , however , every thing was not rosy : “nucleoside synthesis under plau - sibly prebiotic conditions has proved to be unexpectedly dif - ficult , so much so that no really satisfactory method has been reported” ( ibid . , 112 ) . see oró , Miller , and Lazcano 1990 for an updated review . 31 oparin [ 1924 ] 1938 ; Haldane 1929 . 32 “it is often said that all the conditions for the first pro - duction of a living organism are now present , which could ever have been present . But if ( and oh what a big if ) we could conceive in some warm little pond with all sorts of ammo - nia and phosphoric salts , —light , heat , electricity & c . present , that a protein compound was chemically formed , ready to undergo still more complex changes , at the present day such matter wd be instantly devoured , or absorbed , which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed . ” Darwin to Joseph Hooker , February 1 , 1871 , http : / / bevets . com / equotesd . htm . 33 the first to articulate this position was Muller ( 1926 , 1966 ) . see Lazcano 2010 for history . 34 indeed the hope was that AtP itself might also have been so catalyzed . 35 Zahnle , shaefer , and Fegley 2010 ; Zahnle et al . 2007 ; sleep 2010 . 36 “A number of experiments were later carried out using co and co 2 model atmospheres . However , the synthesis of organic compounds by the action of electric discharges on neutral gas mixtures is much less efficient than when reduced model atmospheres are used . As the gas mixture becomes less reducing ( less H 2 , cH 4 or nH 3 ) , the yields of organic compounds decrease drastically , with glycine being the only major amino acid synthesized . the presence of methane and this empirical barrier to the rnA - first school of thought no longer seems as daunt - ing as it once did . For one thing , Miller and his colleagues , right before he died , added a little iron to their previous neutral - atmosphere ex - periments , which seemed to solve the problem . 37 More significant , numerous amino acids and even nucleobases have been discovered on me - teors from outer space , dating to the beginning of the solar system . 38 Whatever the chemical synthesis details , in other words , it once again seems a safe assumption that amino acids and nucleobases were there virtually from the begin - ning , not just on earth but all over the solar sys - tem . the emergence of life might not be just an earthly phenomenon . 39 A second empirical problem has proved to be more recalcitrant . it has so far proven im - possible to synthesize rnA in the lab from its nucleobase , ribosome ( sugar ) , and phosphate components . this is the lower - right arrow in the bottom diagram of figure 2 . 3 . rather than review all the experimental difficulties , which i frankly do not understand , the conclusion of the most prominent rnA - first advocates in the field will be cited : A robust , prebiotically plausible synthe - sis of rnA , if achieved , will dramatically strengthen the case for the rnA world hy - pothesis . Despite nearly a half a century of effort , however , the prospects for such a syn - thesis have appeared somewhat remote . 40 ammonia appears to be especially important for the forma - tion of diverse mixtures of amino acids . the main problem in the synthesis of amino acids and other biologically relevant organic compounds with non - reducing atmospheres appears to be the limited amount of hydrogen cyanide that is formed , which is a central intermediate in the strecker amino acid synthesis and an important precursor for the synthesis of nu - cleobases” ( cleaves et al . 2008 , 106 ) . i have deleted numerous citations , present in the original , from this quote . 37 cleaves et al . 2008 . 38 chyba et al . 1990 ; chyba and sagan 1992 ; cronin and chang 1993 ; ehrenfreund et al . 2002 ; Martins et al . 2008 . 39 All along it has been recognized in the origin - of - life lit - erature that so - called Panspermia —the importation into earth of spores of extraterrestrial organisms—cannot definitively be ruled out by our current evidence , especially in light of the enormous shower of meteors carrying organic compounds that descended upon the earth in its early years . However , no complicated macromolecules like nucleic acids and proteins have been found in meteors . An interesting new “aromatic world” hypothesis about the origin of life ( ehrenfreund et al . 2006 ; ehrenfreund and cami 2010 ) seeks to integrate the extraterrestrial influx of organic materials from early meteors into the existing theories . Moving out even beyond the solar system , Kuan et al . ( 2003 ) document the presence of glycine , the most common amino acid , in the orion galaxy . 40 Anastasi et al . 2008 , 273 . Padgett _ FINAL . indb 40 7 / 20 / 12 8 : 42 AM Autocatalysis in Chemistry ■ 41 From our discussion of prebiotic chemistry we will conclude that the abiotic synthesis of rnA is so difficult that it is unclear that the rnA World could have evolved de novo on the primitive earth . . . . the polymerization of nucleotides in aqueous solution is an uphill reaction and does not occur spontaneously to a significant extent . . . . consequently , at - tempts to polymerize nucleotides from aque - ous solution must necessarily make use of external activating agents . . . . it is possible that all of these , and many other difficulties will one day be overcome and that a convinc - ing prebiotic synthesis of rnA will become available . However , many researchers in the field , myself included , think that this is un - likely and that there must be a different kind of solution to the problem of the origin of the rnA World . 41 An uncharitable way of describing decades of hard experimental work is this : the notion of Hadean oceans chock - full of oparin’s prebiotic soup still enjoys some popularity , but the question remains of how a solution at equilibrium can start doing chem - istry . Put another way , once autoclaved , a bowl of chicken soup left at any temperature will never bring forth life . 42 in the language of autocatalysis , all the pieces of rnA seem to be there in the chicken soup . But there is something missing that turns those pieces into a cyclical chemistry that reproduces . For a while , porous clay seemed to be a promis - ing spatial array within which nucleobases could self - organize . 43 But “there is as yet no experi - mental support for the idea of a self - replicating , informational clay mineral . ” 44 this is the unfor - tunate dead - end in which the rnA - first school of thought currently finds itself . the evolution - ary road leading out from rnA seems clear , but the evolutionary road leading up to rnA is en - shrouded in fog . 45 the metabolism - first school of thought is a second crack at the origin - of - life problem . this 41 orgel 2004 , 100 , 109 , 114 . 42 Martin and russell 2003 , 62 . 43 cairns - smith 1982 ; Ferris 2002 ; Huang and Ferris 2003 . 44 orgel 2004 , 114 . orgel ( 1998 ) and shapiro ( 2006 , 107 – 17 ) provide more details on this negative assessment . 45 not everyone has given up . Anastasi et al . ( 2008 ) outline an experimental search procedure to exhaustively explore all the synthesis options involving compounds similar to rnA that have not been tried over the last fifty years . theoretical position goes back to oparin , but it received a large boost in popularity from the dramatic discovery of life in the late 1970s at the very bottom of the ocean around thermal vents oozing from deep inside the earth . 46 it was not so much the waving tube worms or giant clams that fascinated origin - of - life researchers but the ther - mal bacteria emerging from within the volcanic vents that provided the worms and the clams their food . this was not a warm tidal pond fu - eled by photosynthesis ; this was life based on sulfur and iron . 47 thermal vents reminded geo - chemists of early conditions on earth when vol - canoes interacted chemically with oceans with much greater frequency than they do today . 48 this discovery , moreover , dovetailed nicely with the earliest application of genome sequencing to evolutionary questions , which placed thermal archaebacteria at or near the root of the evo - lutionary tree . 49 Far - from - equilibrium energy throughput obviously is not a problem with thermal vents . on a basic level , the metabolism - first posi - tion and the rnA - first position both agree that autocatalysis in the form of Morowitz’s second diagram in figure 2 . 3 must kick in for chemi - cal life as we know it to emerge . the difference between these positions lies on the emphasis of the metabolism - first school on metallic surface catalysts , which are regarded as having jump - started cyclical metabolism before rnA evolved to do that job more efficiently . 50 thermal vents are perfect for that job because they are porous rock funnels consisting largely of iron , sulfur , and nickel , arranged in tiny 3D compartments . 51 thermal vent theory has been criticized because rnA is not stable at the high temperatures ( ~ 300° c ) of “black smoker” cones . 52 But later - ally away from the central rift , the temperature of thermal vents is not too high ( ~ 50 – 60° c ) , and mixture of magma material with convective seawater is more thorough . 53 in addition , many 46 corliss et al . 1979 . 47 Wächtershäuser 1992 . 48 Baross and Hoffman 1985 , 329 ; sleep 2010 . 49 Woese and Fox 1977 ; Woese , Magrum , and Fox 1978 ; Woese 1981 , 1982 , 1987 ; Achenbach - richter et al . 1987 ; iwabe et al . 1989 ; Woese , Kandler , and Wheelis 1990 ; stetter 1996 , 151 ; Woese 2000 . 50 Wächtershäuser 1988 . 51 vivid pictures of what thermal - vent precipitates look like up close today , in laboratories , and 3 . 6 billion years ago ( two fossils from ireland ) are shown in Martin and russell 2003 , 63 and Martin and russell 2007 , 1914 . thermal vents structurally have not changed over time . 52 Miller and Bada 1988 ; Bada and Lazcano 2002 . 53 russell et al . 1988 ; corliss 1990 ; Martin and russell 2007 , 1914 .

A number of “minimal cores” have been proposed , 57 but the most popular has been the reductive or re - verse citric - acid cycle ( and components thereof ) . the reductive citric - acid cycle is the oxidative or regular citric - acid cycle run in reverse : “Where the Krebs cycle takes complex carbon molecules in the form of sugars and oxidizes them to co2 54 stetter 1996 . recently subterranean archaebacteria also have been discovered deep inside thermal hot springs in idaho ( chappelle et al . 2002 ) , far removed from any organic food other than primitive co 2 and H 2 . the authors speculate that if life exists on Mars , it will be of this form . 55 Morowitz et al . 2000 , 7704 . 56 see Dagley and nicholson 1970 , which breaks this into manageable pieces . 57 A creatively “out of the box” suggestion by Jalbout ( 2008 ) is that the formose cycle , which makes sugars , formed in the gases of outer space . Formaldehyde and glycoaldehyde , key chemicals in that cycle , have been detected there by radio telescope . the formose cycle is the one metabolic cycle that is known to be possible without enzymes . and water , the reverse cycle takes co2 and wa - ter to make carbon molecules . ” 58 the reductive citric - acid cycle is described in terms of both chemical outputs and chemical mechanics in figure 2 . 4 . the reason for the metabolism - first school’s substitution of reverse citric - acid cycle for normal ( oxidative ) citric - acid cycle is that the normal cycle requires biochemical input from the calvin cycle , whereas the reductive citric - acid cycle can process primitive chemicals directly . 59 58 http : / / en . wikipedia . org / wiki / reverse _ Krebs _ cycle . 59 Morowitz 1999 ; smith and Morowitz 2004 .

All the formal models of autocatalysis re - viewed in this section are by definition toy mod - els . Whether their findings carry over into the real world of chemistry requires experimental and paleontological verification . Apart from the details of their individual fates , however , in ensemble they offer the promise that there are general principles about the emergence of life , which are there to be found underneath the enor - mous variety of particular histories of life forms . the models themselves are the “glue” that might be able to connect the biochemical sciences and the social sciences into symbiosis—or if not they themselves , then others like them . it is at least worth a try . Biochemists and social scientists both study “life” in its different manifestations . that doesn’t mean that the word means exactly the same thing in its different realms . But it does mean that the two realms overlap , with evolu - tionary consequences for both sides . AuTOPOIESIS social scientists are likely to have encountered the chemical concept of autocatalysis through the almost identical philosophical concept of “autopoiesis , ” invented by the chilean biolo - gists Maturana and valera 129 and imported into sociology by the German social theorist niklas Luhmann . 130 this pre - history and connotation are , from my perspective , most unfortunate . the concept of autopoiesis , unlike the concept of autocatalysis , was invented with no reference whatsoever to the extensive literature on the origin of life . 131 its intellectual roots lay instead in cybernetic systems theory . 132 Because of this intellectual heritage , autopoiesis emphasizes au - tonomy and self - control , not interdependence ; systems and subsystems , not self - organizing flux ; and static equilibrium , not evolutionary dynam - ics . the concept of autopoiesis itself is fine , but what it is used for is not—at least not if the topic of interest is emergence and the production of novelty . in my opinion , Maturana - varela and 129 varela , Maturana , and Uribe 1974 ; Maturana 1975 , 1981 ; Maturana and varela 1980 ; varela 1979 . their label “autopoiesis , ” invented by them , derives from αύτόσ = self , and π οιειυ = to make . 130 Luhmann 1982 , 1986a , 1989 , 1990 , [ 1984 in German ] 1995 . 131 the papers by Maturana and valera , just cited , contain remarkably few non - self citations : 4 , 0 , z , 23 citations , respec - tively . only varela ( 1979 ) makes a serious effort to engage with the field . that book is the only writing to cite eigen and schuster , who first published on hypercycles in 1971 , but even its references to them are perfunctory . 132 the first english translation of their 1973 spanish book—eventually to become Maturana and varela 1980— was published as a preprint ( Maturana and varela 1975 ) in the research center on cybernetics at the University of illinois established by Heinz von Foerster .

At the end of the period , from 2000 , the star shrinks into a dyad ( D ) . on this basis , we have 1 , 696 such network histories—sequences of positions—for each of the firms in our population . some firms’ histories , of course , are likely to resemble each other ( not because they are tied to each other but because they have similar sequences of network position - ing ) while differing from others . Using an optimal matching algorithm modified from the analysis of gene sequencing , we construct a matrix of pair - wise distances between each of the sequences . optimal matching of sequences is a method that historical sociology borrowed from the natural sciences . the use of optimal matching in the natural sciences typically does not involve temporality ; instead , the sequences are typically spatial . one important area in the natural sci - ences in which optimal matching is used is DnA analysis . DnA molecules are considered to be very similar even when large chunks of the mo - lecular sequence are in reverse order ( sankoff and Kruskal 1999 ) . Unlike measures based on vector similarities , optimal matching has some advantages for historical application ; but it has been justifiably criticized by Wu ( 2000 ) and others ( Levine 2000 ) for its lack of sensitivity to the directionality of time . For example , a firm that is an isolate for eight years and then be - comes a small star periphery in 1995 for the next Table 12 . 5 .
