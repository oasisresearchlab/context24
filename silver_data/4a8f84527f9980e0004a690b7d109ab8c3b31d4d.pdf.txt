The participants were 27 student members of a cake decorating art club from one central university in Taiwan . A quasi - experimental pretest - posttest design was adopted , with 90 h of experimental teaching over 16 weeks . The results , which included the use of a questionnaire , classroom observation , and in - depth interviews , suggest that in terms of creativity , the group participating in ﬂipped classroom learning signiﬁcantly outperformed the group using traditional learning strategies . Furthermore , ﬂipped classroom learning promoted learner motivation and satisfaction . Keywords : ﬂipped classroom , creativity , learning strategies , learning motivation , experimental teaching , creative thinking 2 , learning satisfaction , cake decorating art club INTRODUCTION Decorated cakes play a prominent role in events such as birthdays , wedding anniversaries , and Mother’s Day . Because some consumers demand varied cake decoration , and in response to an increasingly competitive environment , cake decorators must develop more sophisticated techniques to meet consumer needs . Previously , employees were subjected to rigid workplace cultures and were taught , in a mentoring system , to strictly abide by traditional techniques and recipes . Thus , ideas to create new products were considerably limited . Therefore , training cake decorators to be creative artists with a breadth of vision , imagination , and creativity is essential ( Ruhlman , 2001 ) . Particularly , in the study of creativity , creativity is not only seen as a way of thinking and acting but also as an indication of innovation capability . Some researchers believe that creativity can be cultivated through education or training ( Nickerson , 1999 ; Fasko , 2000 ; Donnelly , 2004 ; Steen - Utheim and Foldnes , 2018 ) . Decorated cake art is the combination of cuisine and art . A course in cake decoration aims to cultivate cultural , artistic , and creative decorators . In addition to knowledge and technologies imparted by classroom teachers , students can make use of club activities with a group of like - minded people in pursuit of common goals and ideals . Student clubs are not subject to time and curriculum constraints , and a group of profession - oriented people with common interests can make use of extracurricular time to discuss , study , and improve their work and enhance their innovation energy . Students in a cake decorating art club must eﬀectively apply learning methods , strategies , materials , and platforms to achieve ideal learning outcomes and pursue optimal creative expression ( Clark and Peterson , 1986 ) . Taiwan’s Fu Jen Catholic University ( 2014 ) used the ﬂipped classroom learning strategy to survey 500 teachers in 2012 , and the results revealed the following : the satisfaction percentage was 1 . 88 % ; 46 % of the teachers indicated that satisfaction showed a “very signiﬁcant improvement ; ” 2 . 67 % of the teachers indicated that student test scores had Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 1 December 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 533187 fpsyg - 11 - 533187 December 29 , 2020 Time : 13 : 14 # 2 Tien et al . The Impact of Flipped Classroom on the Creativity improved signiﬁcantly ; and 2 . 8 % of the teachers indicated that the learning motivation of students had improved signiﬁcantly . A ﬂipped classroom uses online learning materials and audio - visual aids to augment the pre - existing knowledge and skills of students before the lesson is taught . This approach stimulates student interest in learning and enhances student satisfaction with learning . The actual learning activities that students participate in can easily trigger their learning motivation . Thai et al . ( 2017 ) compared the ﬂipped classroom approach with other learning strategies and determined that the ﬂipped classroom exhibits higher learning eﬀectiveness than other teaching methods and exerts a positive eﬀect on student learning satisfaction and intrinsic motivation . At present , “ﬂipped - learning” is popular and is recognized as the best method to stimulate the creative thinking of students ( Bergmann and Sams , 2012 ; Islim , 2018 ) ; the core concept of ﬂipped learning is learner centered . When students become the central focus of a lesson , they can choose what to read and can arrange their learning progress according to their level and time . Thus , they can directly participate in activities that can likely enhance their learning motivation ( Hathorn and Ingram , 2002 ) , thus obtaining excellent results ( Hwang et al . , 2011 ) . Accordingly , by using the ﬂipped classroom approach , cake decorating art clubs can have the following advantages . First , following instructional videos , students can learn the production process , make a cake at home , preliminarily experiment with ﬂavors , and design decoration blueprints in advance . Second , for cake making , furnishing , and decoration , if students have a problem , they can re - watch instructional videos on computer networks , smartphones , and other tools ; furthermore , students can be tested through immediate self - testing questions to detect their problems . Third , during the process of self - learning , if students are confused , they can return to the classroom for discussion with classmates and thus improve themselves through cooperative learning , opinion sharing , and problem solving . Fourth , in the process of ﬂipped classroom learning , students continue to learn and think , which may trigger their enthusiasm and further stimulate their creative thinking ( Chen and Guo , 2012 ) . Flipped classroom learning has been applied in formal courses in subject areas such as social humanities , medicine , and nature science , with excellent achievements ( Akinoglu and Tandogan , 2006 ; Strayer , 2007 ; O’Dowd and Aguilar - Roca , 2009 ; Hwang et al . , 2011 ) . However , no study in the ﬁeld of cooking club learning activities exists , and no study has developed new community mentor teaching and learning strategies to stimulate student creativity . Therefore , this study attempted to apply the ﬂipped classroom model to a cake decorating art club for the purpose of exploring how ﬂipped classroom learning inﬂuences artistic creativity in cake decoration . The purposes of this study were as follows : ( 1 ) To determine whether diﬀerent learning strategies inﬂuence artistic creativity in cake decoration . ( 2 ) To investigate whether ﬂipped learning aﬀects student motivation and the degree of learning satisfaction . LITERATURE Flipped Classroom Meaning The ﬂipped classroom is a learning model that promotes communication between teachers and students through pre - class self - preparation , classroom teaching , and after - class exercises . It is learner centered , emphasizing student problem - solving and practical operations as well as the cultivation of high - level thinking and creativity ( Chang and Hwang , 2018 ; Zainuddin , 2018 ) , in contrast to traditional lecture - based teaching with the teacher as the “lecture material deliverer” ( González - Gómez et al . , 2016 ; Hao , 2016 ; Sohrabi and Iraj , 2016 ) . The ﬂipped classroom requires students to initiate self - learning activities through online textbooks , audio , and videos before class , which may improve student pre - knowledge and skills , stimulate learning interest and motivation , encourage participation in actual classroom learning activities , and enhance their independent learning ability and interaction with the learning content . This approach can also increase self - initiated learning ( Lin and Tsai , 2020 ) . With in - depth exercises and output in class ( He et al . , 2016 ; Chang and Hwang , 2018 ) , the strategy of ﬂipped classroom teaching can be used by students in the practice of learning by doing , and doing by learning . The initiative of learning truly rests on the students themselves , which enhances their learning motivation ( Thai et al . , 2017 ) . Teaching Model The ﬂipped classroom , proposed by Bergmann and Sams ( 2012 ) , is also known as the “reversed classroom . ” It reverses the traditional learning environment , and students have to prepare a lesson in a ﬂipped classroom . When encountering diﬃcult problems , students can discuss their problem with each other through online cooperative learning ; back in the classroom , teachers can guide students to speculate , discuss , and share results . Lo et al . ( 2018 ) adopted the ﬂipped classroom education model in microeconomics courses at the University of Miami , and students read speciﬁc parts of a workbook , listened to an audio recording , or previewed related slides before class . Subsequently , instructors gave a 10 - min mini - lecture in the classroom , made guided inquiries , and oﬀered guidance directed toward the assigned reading ; during the remaining time , students were arranged to engage in research work , experiments , or cooperative learning . This teaching strategy allowed students to complete the learning of basic knowledge and concepts outside class time , which broke the traditional mode of teacher - centered learning . In the traditional learning mode , students listen in the classroom and perform practice activities afterward . Flipped learning is an innovative learning model . Impact of Flipped Classroom on Creativity Class activities are not teacher - centered but rather involve cooperative learning and critical thinking training ; interactive activities are designed to solve problems through group work . In the 1990s , Eric Mazur , a physics professor at Harvard University , Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 2 December 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 533187 fpsyg - 11 - 533187 December 29 , 2020 Time : 13 : 14 # 3 Tien et al . The Impact of Flipped Classroom on the Creativity observed that students only responded to tests and did not utilize knowledge . The professor then asked students to preview the material , and students then reﬂected on problems encountered during “prep” through the web ; afterward , the professor guided students to speculate and discuss and set them on creative thinking tasks in the classroom . To motivate creativity , ﬂipped classroom activities must have good patterns in order to attain learning goals . The annular ﬂipped classroom constructed by Gerstein ( 2011 ) is a four - stage model ; the stages are experiential engagement , concept exploration , meaning making , and demonstration and application . A ﬂipped classroom lesson usually begins with participatory learning activities , such as team cooperation , problem - solving exercises , games , and experimental activities . Outside the classroom , students by themselves watch instructional videos , engage with a podcast curriculum , and visit teaching sites ; in addition , they participate in online discussions and in other ways to explore the meaning of related concepts ( Zhong et al . , 2013 ) . Next , the students complete tests , write a podcast , and make reﬂective audio recordings and videos to complete the construction of their own knowledge . Finally , teams demonstrate learning outcomes and applications through creative , personalized items and presentations . The ﬂipped classroom can entail two stages : before class and in class . In the ﬁrst stage , students must watch instructional videos before class and then conduct practice tasks . In the second stage , in class , students must rapidly complete a few tests , followed by problem solving to complete the internalization of knowledge . Finally , they draw a conclusion and provide feedback . The entire learning process is student - centered , with an activity - oriented approach . Flipped classroom activities allow students to demonstrate creativity and ingenuity , increasing the worth and uniqueness of work . Furthermore , ﬂipped learning can enhance the artistic value of work and let students perceive and compare advantages and shortcomings of their own work and that of others’ work . Students can sum up the characteristics of creative works and thus strengthen their critical thinking and creativity . Hsieh ( 2003 ) found that peer assessment may provide students with opportunities to enhance critical thinking and the ability to express appreciation . Kaufman et al . ( 2009 ) argued that creative thinking and critical thinking skills are always interoperable ; the ﬁrst is divergent thinking and the second is convergent thinking , and the two closely cooperate and inter - operate , leading to eﬀective thinking ( Zhang , 2013 ) . Adopting ﬂipped learning in student club activities may eﬀectively stimulate thinking and promote creativity . Relationship Between the Flipped Classroom and Learning Motivation and Satisfaction Lin and Lin ( 2016 ) observed that ﬂipped classroom learning helps students acquire knowledge and skills more eﬀectively . Teachers can provide relevant textbook content in advance , for example , ingredient functionality , quantity yield , weight per portion , procedures , and an image of the ﬁnished product . This approach may allow students to review the content of the course video recorded by a teacher and initiate self - directed learning based on the recipe . It may also help students grasp key points for preview purposes and help them obtain pre - knowledge of the course content . In ﬂipped classroom learning , students can use Facebook , YouTube , computer networks , smartphones , and other social media and electronic devices to watch video instructions at any time . Again , students can ubiquitously learn without being restricted by time and space ( Hwang et al . , 2010 ) . Many scholars have noted that the learning interest of learners in ﬂipped classrooms and the integrity of the curriculum design aﬀect student satisfaction with ﬂipped classroom learning . Flipped classroom learning can enhance motivational eﬀectiveness and learning satisfaction ( Kunter et al . , 2007 ; Kim et al . , 2014 ; Chen et al . , 2016 ) . Lin and Tsai ( 2020 ) conﬁrmed that when teachers adopt the aspects of the ﬂipped classroom teaching model , such as providing relevant materials beforehand , this can help students grasp the key points of a chapter . In addition , posing questions before class can strengthen existing professional knowledge and improve student attention . These strategies can signiﬁcantly improve student knowledge , skills , and learning satisfaction . The learning strategy of the ﬂipped classroom can enhance student interest in learning and learning motivation and can result in learning satisfaction . Creativity Creative personnel training is the most essential education and economic policy for the 21st century ( Chen , 2006 ) . In the wave of knowledge - based economy and globalization , creative personnel training has recently become a key goal at all levels of education in Taiwan ( Chen et al . , 2005 ; Tang , 2005 ) . Taiwan launched the “White Paper of Creativity Education” in 2002 , which concerns ﬁve main areas : individuals , schools , society , industry , and culture . Furthermore , “teaching innovation” and “creativity cultivation” are included in teacher evaluations , appointments , and grading indexes . Creativity is encouraged as a selection criterion in entrance examinations at all levels of school . Creativity has become a future trend in education . Creativity refers to innovating knowledge through mental organization and re - composition , such that a new thing is inspired ; this force is called “creativity” . Creativity is based on prior knowledge and experience , and students employ their personality traits such as curiosity , imagination , and adventure . They apply learned creating art to create new , strange , and unique products through a ﬂexible and eﬃcient creative process , which portrays their smooth , unique , and sophisticated abilities ( Torrance , 1962 ; Guilford , 1967 ) . Zhang ( 2013 ) interprets creativity as “the formation of a new concept of psychological process beyond the existing experience , breaking the limitation of habits in problem situations ; and ﬂexible application experience with problem - solving abilities without conventions and restriction . ” To facilitate research into creative thinking , creativity is often considered as including two components : “ﬂuency” and “elasticity . ” Fluency is the ability to smoothly and quickly come up with many solutions for a problem . Elasticity usually refers to the ability to ﬁnd problems and “get hold of” a diverse and Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 3 December 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 533187 fpsyg - 11 - 533187 December 29 , 2020 Time : 13 : 14 # 4 Tien et al . The Impact of Flipped Classroom on the Creativity unique answer ; that is , a diversity of applications can be found for existing things , which is considered an ability to think elastically ( Adams et al . , 1994 ) . In brief , according to scholarly perspectives , creativity is deﬁned as an ability to think creatively . Assessment of Creativity Generally , the assessment of creativity is explored from the viewpoint of process , person , product , and press / place . Amabile ( 1983 ) indicated that whether the process of thinking is creative depends on the ultimate product . Amabile emphasized that a product or an observed reaction is the ultimate proof of creativity . Runco et al . ( 2000 – 2001 ) have pointed out that “creativity is often deﬁned according to the product . ” In general , most scholars deﬁne creativity from the creation of a “product , ” which is relatively able to reach a consensus ( Mayer , 1999 ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS The Establishment of Flipped Classroom Teaching Before the semester began , the construction of a learning platform was completed . Curriculum content ( nine units ) was placed in smartphones and on Facebook , YouTube , and other sites . Students in the club were then asked to download materials from the platform before the ﬁrst class . Students could view the content at any time , which oﬀered them ﬂexibility ; they were able to learn , no matter when or where ( Hwang et al . , 2010 ) . Students watched videos to understand materials , such as the production process ( as in Figure 1 ) , the baking process , and baking completion ( see Figure 2 ) . For example , what are the chiﬀon cake ingredients ? What is the weight of those ingredients ? What amounts are required ? ( see Figure 3 ) . Students could re - watch videos if they were puzzled and read and take notes at their own pace . Students that were afraid to ask an instructor a question for the fear of being made fun of and consequently losing interest in learning was thus avoided . In addition , cameras were placed in the classroom to observe learning activities , as shown in Figures 4 , 5 . FIGURE 1 | The process of making a chiffon cake . When students returned to the formal classroom , the instructors inspected learning outcomes and student creativity by means of reviewing worksheets ( Figure 6 ) . Instructors thus “got the hang of” what students had learned , any queries students had , and what imagination or creative thinking they had employed . Accordingly , the instructors came to understand the learning situations of the students . They provided guidance by sharing observations , directing activities , moderating discussions , promoting cooperative learning and product presentations and , lastly , encouraging students to create works , as shown in Figure 7 . Experimental Design and Samples The experimental course included nine units : chiﬀon cake , raw cheesecake , yeast muﬃn , almond cake , brownie cheesecake , cupcake , mousse cake , duo - tone cake , and creative decorated cake . The experimental procedures of this research refer to Chiou ( 2009 ) using the non - equivalent control group design . The experimental subjects were divided into an experimental group and control group . O 1 X 1 O 2 O 1 X 2 O 2 Before the experiment , both groups were given the same topic for pre - test ( O 1 ) . After the pre - test , the experimental group used the ﬂipped classroom method ( X 1 ) ; the control group used the traditional narration method ( X 2 ) . After the experiment , both groups accepted the post - test on the same topic ( O 2 ) to detect the diﬀerences in learning between the two groups of students . A sample of 27 people ( aged approximately 19 – 20 years ) was randomly selected from a cake decorating student club in the hospitality department of a university . For a period of 16 weeks , 5 h per week , 12 people were allocated into the experimental group , which was further divided into four groups ; each group of three people participated in ﬂipped classroom learning . The control group of 15 people was divided into ﬁve groups , with each FIGURE 2 | A chiffon cake after baking .

The number of the control group and marshaling was the same as the experimental group ; the two groups were tested separately , and the pre - test score was taken as the covariate variable . For the sake of objectivity , both the groups had the same instructor , a specialized technical associate professor with approximately 20 years teaching experience and chef experience in a domestic ﬁve - star West Point hotel . Assessment Tool Matrix for Creative Culinary Works Scale Matrix for Creative Culinary Works is a creative cooking product rating scale developed by Horng and Lin ( 2009 ) . This scale was adopted and modiﬁed by four experts ( two from the hospitality department and two from the industry ) . It contained four subscales . Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 6 December 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 533187 fpsyg - 11 - 533187 December 29 , 2020 Time : 13 : 14 # 7 Tien et al . The Impact of Flipped Classroom on the Creativity TABLE 1 | The score sheet of cake decoration . Name of product : Maker : Full face photo Proﬁle photo Taste : Such as chocolate or fruit The story’s description : The ﬁrst was for “professional techniques” and contained ( 1 ) cake decoration tips , ( 2 ) operation correctness of the batter mixing process , ( 3 ) cake baking process operation , and ( 4 ) production process and hygiene . The second was for “color” and “shape” and measured ( 1 ) uniqueness of painting , ( 2 ) uniqueness of shape and style , ( 3 ) holistic shape , and ( 4 ) esthetic appearance . The third subscale was for “ﬂavor” and “taste” and measured ( 1 ) internal meticulous organization , ( 2 ) uniqueness of ﬂavor , and ( 3 ) density and refreshment . The fourth was the overall assessment and measured ( 1 ) commerciality , ( 2 ) attractiveness , ( 3 ) cake named after a creative theme , ( 4 ) compatibility with story , and ( 5 ) creativity of cake integrity . This scorecard , with a total of 16 questions , was used for the pre - test and post - test . Scores were given on a 5 - point Likert scale from “high” ( 5 points ) to “low” ( 1 point ) . The reliability of its items ranged from 0 . 88 to 0 . 95 , and the reliability of the overall scale was 0 . 98 , indicating good reliability . In addition to on - site instructor scoring , according to the recommendation of Associate Professor Huang’s students , creative ideas and achievements were presented in a photo , tagged with a cake decorating score sheet ( Table 1 ) , and it was then sent to experts for rating on the basis of the designed “creative cooking product rating scale . ” Learning Motivation and Satisfaction Scale To understand students’ feelings and views on learning motivation and satisfaction regarding learning strategies , the authors referred to the measurement tool compiled by Chiou et al . ( 2004 ) , the “Learning Attitudes Scale , ” which has a Cronbach’s α of 0 . 89 . The survey instrument was reviewed by three experts , which made the learning attitude questionnaire of this study more valid and reliable . In - depth interviews of the experimental group were conducted immediately after the completion of the survey to discuss learning motivation . Research Implementation Procedure The experimental procedure is outlined in Table 2 . The implementation was as follows . The teaching experiment was divided into three stages . The ﬁrst stage was the preparation stage and included ( 1 ) setting up a digital teaching platform and a classroom camera ; ( 2 ) making a cake decoration teaching video , and creating a curriculum plan and a study list for student activities . Two pastry instructors and two baking curriculum experts from inside and outside of the school were invited to review and revise course materials . Therefore , the content of the teaching material accurately corresponded with expert perspectives ; and ( 3 ) developing the creative cake art product scale , with questions for the pre - test and post - test , to understand the creativity of the two groups of students . The pre - test was conducted with 35 students who had completed a cake decoration course . Reliability and validity were tested , and the items were screened . The second stage was the pre - test stage , which included the following . ( 1 ) Instructors used traditional teaching methods to teach three units ( e . g . , chiﬀon cake and cheesecake ) to TABLE 2 | The process of the study implementation . Stage Activities The ﬁrst stage ( The 1st week ) Preparation phase ( 1 ) Make and select instructional videos of making decorated cakes . ( 2 ) Complete experts’ examination of instructional videos .

The Impact of Flipped Classroom on the Creativity both groups of students for a total of 12 h over 4 weeks . ( 2 ) One week after the three units were completed , the pre - test ( the creative cake art product assessment scale derived from the Matrix for Creative Culinary Works ) was administered to examine the creativity of the two groups . The third stage was the formal experimental stage as follows : ( 1 ) The experimental group implemented ﬂipped classroom learning methods , whereas traditional learning methods were applied with the control group . The learning content included brownie cheesecake , cupcakes , mousse cake , two - color cake , and creative cake decoration , for a total of ﬁve units . The duration of the experimental teaching period was 13 weeks ( 39 h ) . ( 2 ) One week afterward , both groups took the same creative cake art assessment post - test . Interviews were conducted with the experimental group regarding their learning motivation and teaching and learning activities . Data Analysis Method Because the pre - test scores of the experimental class and the control class were diﬀerent , in order to avoid the diﬀerence in the previous levels of the two classes aﬀecting the experimental results , a covariance analysis ( ANCOVA ) was used to solve this problem . In this study , an ANCOVA was performed using the pre - test as the covariate and the post - test as the dependent variable . Before using the ANCOVA , a within - group regression coeﬃcient homogeneity test was ﬁrst performed to see if it was appropriate to use this statistical method . RESULTS ANALYSIS The Effect of Different Learning Strategies on Student Creativity Experiment Participants This study adopted a quasi - experimental design . Again , the experimental group consisted of 12 students , accounting for 44 . 4 % of the total ; the control group consisted of 15 students , accounting for 55 . 6 % of the total . To eliminate interference from unrelated variables , single factor one - way univariate analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) was used to correct for any interfering variables and improve the internal validity of the results . The learning strategies were viewed as independent variables , the pre - test scores were covariates , and the post - test scores were the dependent variable . The Comparison of Two Averages and Standard Deviation Prior to the experiment , students had knowledge of cake decoration . From the ﬁrst to the 7th week , the instructor , course content , time , duration , learning hours , worksheets , and teaching methods were identical . The pre - test was performed for the two groups in the 8th week ( Figure 8 ) . The results indicate that the average pre - test score of the experimental group was 43 . 5 points ; the score of the control group was 42 . 8 points . The diﬀerence between the two groups was only 0 . 7 points , which was insigniﬁcant . After the pre - test , the experiment began . The experimental group adopted the ﬂipped learning strategy , whereas the control group made use of traditional learning strategies . The post - test was conducted in the 16th week . The average post - test score for the experimental group was 52 . 2 points , with a standard deviation of 3 . 95 points , and that of the control group was 15 . 7 points , with a standard deviation of 2 . 06 ; the diﬀerence between the two averages was 6 . 5 points . Eﬀect size measured the magnitude of the inﬂuence of the learning method and was computed as the mean score of the post - test minus the mean score of the pre - test , divided by the standard deviation of the pre - test ( Cohen , 1988 ) . According to Cohen’s ( 1988 ) rule , the eﬀect size of the experimental group was 0 . 62 , indicating that the use of ﬂipped classroom teaching had a moderate eﬀect on student creativity . The eﬀect size for the control group was 0 . 06 , indicating the use of traditional teaching had no eﬀect on student creativity . The results therefore indicate that the performance of the experimental group was signiﬁcantly better than that of the control group . Many studies have determined that teachers’ guidance , thinking , and behavior aﬀect the learning and thinking of students ( Barell , 2003 ; Costa , 2006 ) . Yeh ( 2004 ) have aﬃrmed that classroom interaction , learning strategies , and a supportive learning environment can stimulate and enhance student creativity . Clark and Peterson ( 1986 ) observed that student thinking , planning , and decision making constitute the major part of the psychological environment of learning ; classroom teaching , teaching materials , learning methods , teaching design , and the teacher - student interaction exert a direct eﬀect on learning quality . One - Way Univariate Analysis of Covariance As Table 3 indicates , the result of the test for homogeneity was F = 0 . 998 ( P = 0 . 328 , > 0 . 05 ) , which was not signiﬁcant . Thus , the homogeneity assumption of the regression coeﬃcient group was not violated , in line with the basic assumption , and an analysis of covariance was conducted . As observed in Table 4 , excluding the eﬀect of the pre - test scores ( covariance ) , its F - value was 28 . 717 and the P - value ( P < 0 . 001 ) was signiﬁcant , which implies that the ﬂipped classroom learning strategy was superior to traditional learning strategies . The Effect of Different Learning Strategies on Learning Motivation and Learning Satisfaction With the use of a questionnaire , a learning satisfaction survey of the experimental group was conducted . This was followed by in - depth interviews exploring the feelings and views of the experimental group regarding the teaching activities . The analysis results are as follows : ( 1 ) Can ﬂipped classroom learning trigger your motivation ? In all , 83 % of the students strongly agreed and 17 % agreed ; thus , all students agreed that ﬂipped classroom learning strategies , for decorated cake creativity , were able to trigger their motivation . Watching teaching videos at home was helpful for understanding cake ingredients , cake making processes , cake decorating , cake baking , cake painting , and baking time . When students had a basic understanding of making a cake , they had more enthusiasm to work together and discuss cake modeling , Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 8 December 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 533187 fpsyg - 11 - 533187 December 29 , 2020 Time : 13 : 14 # 9 Tien et al .

Again , if they became confused , students were able to re - watch videos , which avoids the fear of asking the teacher questions or of being made fun of and consequently losing interest in learning . ( 2 ) Can the ﬂipped teaching strategy make you better understand the baking process of making a decorated cake and the amount of water storage capacity ? In all , 92 % of students strongly agreed and 8 % agreed . In baking , the amount of water plays a key role in success or failure . Two processes are especially critical to success in the process of making a cake . One is the batter mixing process , and the other is the amount of water storage capacity in the baking process . Only a perfect operation can produce high - quality cakes . Liu ( 1999 ) pointed out that stirring is determinable for batter quality in the mixing process , and stirring is a crucial factor in the physical structure of a cake ; the degree of agitation is essential to cake quality . Xu et al . ( 1996 ) conﬁrmed that the amount of water aﬀects whether the cake is dense or solid when baked . This professional knowledge and the production process were visualized and presented through a teaching video , and then , the instructor and students discussed them and shared outcomes , which helped students fully understand the skills of cake baking . ( 3 ) Can the ﬂipped classroom learning strategy make learning the art of decorated cake making simpler ? Here , 100 % of students agreed . All students agreed that the ﬂipped classroom can make learning easier because the video functions of pause or rewind for repeat viewing can be used with a teaching video in order to understand the cake making process . For example , overlong stirring time leads to large speciﬁc gravity , small volume , large holes , stickiness , and bad taste , thus , the cake is not agreeable . However , insuﬃcient mixing time results in sparse batter that is diﬃcult to fully bake ; thus , the interior of the product will be wetter . ( 4 ) Can the ﬂipped classroom make you more creative in the process of learning ? In all , 92 % of students strongly agreed ; 8 % agreed . Most students agreed that watching teaching videos before class was helpful for understanding the process of cake making , which enabled more imaginative cake modeling . With worksheets , students drew their own ideas into a single pattern and then returned to the club to discuss them with other students , observe other products , and write the story of their product . The appearance of a decorated cake is created through story , which makes the product richer and more creative . ( 5 ) Can ﬂipped classroom learning make you more creative in the process of making artistic cakes ? Overall , 83 % of students strongly agreed , and 17 % agreed . Most students stated that , by watching the process of cake making , the brain imagines a wide range of shapes and diﬀerent ﬂavors of cake . Then , in the club , they can discuss the shape of the cake or the recipe of a unique taste with others . Mutual observation and cooperative learning may contribute to the creation of a good product ; the works of decorated cake would thus contain more diversity and creativity . In traditional learning , students only followed instructions given by the instructor or the president of the club to make duplicate cakes , and fewer creative ideas entered the product . ( 6 ) Do you think that the “ﬂipped classroom learning strategy” is suitable for learning creativity in artistic cake design ? All 100 % of the students strongly agreed . Most students felt that the ﬂipped classroom was very good for their learning . By watching teaching videos , they were able to grasp the principles and procedures of cake making , for example , the degree of agitation , formulation of additives , capacity of water storage in the baking process , baking , molding , cooling , and decoration . Because they became quite familiar with the cake ingredients and the use of the appliances , they could successfully complete cake production . CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION Conclusion This study sheds light on the eﬀect of diﬀerent learning strategies for creativity in the area of cake decoration learning . The results revealed that the experimental group , students undergoing ﬂipped learning , had better performance in creativity than the control group ; that is , students undergoing traditional learning . The ﬂipped classroom is a student - centered learning mode ; before the course , students were able to watch teaching videos to learn the entire production process of decorated cake baking , including ingredients , mixing , baking , molding , cooling , decorating , and shaping . Furthermore , students painted their ideas and stories on worksheets ; the process of drawing may spark the imagination and inspire creativity . One student mentioned , with respect to the appearance and taste of the cake , that they wanted to use extruded whipped cream to make a fairy tale character , and that the formulation should be of delicate taste . When the students decorated a cake at home , they encountered diﬃculties . Therefore , they not only repeated production but Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 10 December 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 533187 fpsyg - 11 - 533187 December 29 , 2020 Time : 13 : 14 # 11 Tien et al . The Impact of Flipped Classroom on the Creativity also continued to imagine the end product . Therefore , even when they failed to successfully complete the cake decoration , they generated numerous ideas , which could stimulate more creative works , through the guidance of the instructor and peer discussion , when they returned to the classroom . Chung and Chow ( 2004 ) argued that active learning can inspire creativity , but students must have prior knowledge , life experiences , and a background related to the issue ; students can participate in discussions with other students in the classroom or engage in active learning after class ( Lee and Wang , 1998 ) . Vygotsky ( 2004 ) had the view that creativity is based on the elements of past experiences ; this is because the human brain extracts memories and , simultaneously , breaks down , links , and remodels experience to generate new propositions and new behavior ( Vygotsky , 1987 ) . Accordingly , by means of ﬂipped classroom learning , students understood the entire process of decorated cake making . They drew what they watched and imagined on worksheets ; in the process of drawing , they continued thinking , conceiving , and asking questions . Then , they returned to the club , where they received guidance from the instructor . In addition , through cooperative learning , they learned from each other , which inspired them to employ creativity in creating products with unique shapes or ﬂavors . In - depth interviews revealed that students believed that ﬂipped classroom learning can increase motivation . In addition to making cake making simpler , ﬂipped classroom learning prompted their own unique ideas . The process of making a decorated cake is cumbersome and complicated . The weight of ingredients , stirring , baking time , foaming , the appearance of whipped cream , and decorating all must be considered . Flipped classroom learning can proceed according to student reading speed ; furthermore , students can repeatedly watch teaching videos and make a cake at home in advance . In the production process , students may learn spontaneously and ﬁnd solutions actively if they encounter diﬃculties or feel confused . Accordingly , the students conﬁrmed that autonomous ﬂipped learning made cake classes easier to understand , stimulated learning motivation , maintained learning , and allowed them to achieve learning goals . Classroom observation revealed that most students in the experimental group exhibited more serious learning attitudes and were more attentive , and only a few students played with their phone or chatted . By contrast , students in the control group were “hurry - scurry” and appeared unsure of what to do ; some played on their phone alone or chatted with others , and only a few students took serious notes and followed the steps to make a cake . As for the speed of completing cake making , the control group was slower than the experimental group . Classroom observation also suggested that the experimental group outperformed the control group in terms of the student learning ability and the taste and shape of cakes . The results conﬁrmed that the ﬂipped classroom is an eﬀective learning strategy for creativity . Suggestion The results of this study cannot be generalized to students of Chinese or Western cooking , housekeeping services , or customer service technology , or to other student communities . Furthermore , this was a short - term study ; a long - term study would be required to ascertain the retention of the identiﬁed learning outcomes . After observing teaching in the classroom , the researchers discovered that the instructor retained traditional teaching methods . The instructor was unable to make suﬃcient use of technology and IT and thus encourage students to be innovative and capable of problem solving . The ﬂipped classroom teaching mode does not have a ﬁxed pattern ; thus , instructors cannot give proper guidance for student creativity and innovation . Accordingly , future research can investigate whether the teacher’s ability to use IT aﬀects student innovation and creativity . At present , many DIY businesses are attached to physical stores in the baking industry . Thus , consumers without baking experience can use mobile phones to download and follow videos to make a cake and , when watching a video , they can ask the clerk if they have a problem . Due to the prevalence of online learning , learning is no longer limited to a “classroom” ; and learning is not limited by time or place . Future research can explore whether adding music to teaching videos improves student interest , motivation , and concentration .
