Keywords : Endocytosis Clathrin 1 - butanol Live - cell imaging Actin Phosphoinositides Introduction The growth , invagination , pinching and uncoating of clathrin - coated pits are governed by protein – protein and protein – lipid interactions ( reviewed in [ 1 , 2 ] ) . Phosphoinositide - 4 , 5 - bipho - sphate ( PIP2 ) has been proposed to play a central role in coated pit mediated endocytosis [ 1 , 2 ] . The clathrin adaptor AP - 2 binds to PIP2 [ 3 ] and this interaction is in part responsible for recruitment of AP - 2 to the plasma membrane [ 4 ] . Phosphati - dylinositol 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase ( PIP5K ) , the enzyme that generates PIP2 , interacts with AP - 2 through a direct contact with μ 2 - adaptin , one of its subunits [ 5 ] . Depletion of PIP5K β by RNAi treatment in HeLa cells decreased the cellular level of PIP2 and reduced the clathrin - dependent endocytosis of transferrin , whereas overexpression of PIP5K β had the oppo - site effect , while also increasing the number of clathrin - coated pits at the plasma membrane [ 6 ] . Another way to stimulate the activity of PIP5K is by exposing it to phosphatidic acid ( PA ) , the product of the transphosphatidylation reaction catalyzed by phospholipase D ( PLD ) [ 7 ] . Normal activity of PLD is required for clathrin - mediated internalization of the angiotensin - and μ - opioid receptors and for degradation of epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor [ 8 – 10 ] .

Treat - ment with 1 - butanol was used to show the dependence on PIP2 of AP - 2 recruitment to lysosomal membranes in vitro [ 12 ] and also to dissect aspects of vesicular traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus [ 12 – 15 ] . Here we show that treatment of cells with 1 - butanol , as well as other primary alcohols , blocks the endocytosis of transferrin and the formation of coated pits and vesicles . We observe rapid disappearance of coated pits and a complete block in the appearance of new ones . The latter effect of 1 - butanol on coated pit formation is completely reversed if cells are incubated with liposomes enriched with PIP2 , consistent with the essential role of PIP2 in coated pit assembly . We also observed formation of new coated pits just seconds after removal of the primary alcohols . The coated pits mature to coated vesicles with kinetic parameters similar to those measured in untreated cells . The appearance of new pits is almost synchronous , forming during the first ∼ 3 min with a much higher frequency than usual , before returning to normal values . We have used this synchronization to dissect the role of actin in coated pit assembly . In yeast cells , the actin and clathrin - based machineries are interlinked in sustaining normal endocytosis [ 16 ] . In mammalian cells , however , the role of actin in the clathrin - based endocytic pathway is less well defined . Actin is recruited to assembling coated vesicles in mammalian cells [ 17 – 19 ] and it has therefore been suggested that it also critical for coated pit formation [ 19 ] and membrane scission [ 17 , 18 ] . Pharmacological interfer - ence ( Latrunculin A or B or Cytochalasin D ) with actin assembly prevents to variable degrees ( 0 to 80 % inhibition ) the uptake of transferrin [ 6 , 20 – 24 ] . We have interfered pharmacologically with actin assembly in the presence or absence of 1 - butanol . We find that inhibiting the actin polymerization has no detectable effects on the growth and maturation of an individual coated pit as it transforms into a fully formed coated vesicle , nor does it have detectable effects on the final uncoating step . In contrast , there is a progressive decrease in the frequency of new coated pit formation , an increase in the number of large clathrin / AP - 2 clusters and a coalescence of active zones , the plasma membrane regions available for pit assembly [ 25 ] . As in control cells , 1 - butanol exposure to cells pre - treated with Latrunculin B led to the rapid loss of coated pits and vesicles , which reappeared promptly when 1 - butanol was removed . We suggest that the actin cytoskeleton helps create diffusion barriers or confinement zones at the plasma membrane of mammalian cells that favor the buildup of phosphoinositides and protein factors required for efficient formation of coated pits . Materials and methods Cell culture and transfection BSC - 1 , COS - 7 and HeLa cells were grown as previously described [ 25 ] . BSC - 1 and HeLa cell lines stably expressing EGFP - fusion chimeras of AP - 2 or LCa or galactosyltransfer - ase ( GalT ) were described previously [ 25 , 26 ] . We have generated cell lines stably expressing EGFP - fusion chimeras of AP - 1 , AP - 3 , Arf1 , Caveolin - 1 , β - COP or ε - COP by transfec - tion with the respective plasmids ( see below ) followed by selection and maintenance with complete medium supple - mented with geneticin ( G418 , 0 . 5 – 0 . 7 mg / ml ) . All other constructs were transiently expressed . Cells were prepared for fluorescence microscopy experiments as previously described [ 25 ] . The following chemicals and fluorescent probes were employed : LatA , LatB , CytoD ( Sigma ) , HEPES ( VWR ) , geneticin ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , Alexa Fluor 594 human transferrin ( Molecular Probes ) , Rhodamine Phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) . Plasmids Rat clathrin light chain A1 , dynamin2 , sigma - 1 , sigma - 2 , sigma - 3a ( tetrameric clathrin adaptors small chains ) , Arf1 , rab22 and Caveolin1 were fused to fluorescent proteins ( EGFP , Tomato ) using C1 or N1 terminal fusion vectors ( BD Biosciences Clontech ) . All transfections were carried out using FuGENE 6 ( Roche Diagnostics , Indianapolis , IN ) . Preparation of cells for imaging The preparation of cells for imaging was as previously described [ 25 ] . For t - butanol and 1 - butanol applications , the imaging medium was replaced with imaging medium contain - ing indicated % v / v of compound . Washouts were performed by replacing back the imaging medium . Image acquisition Confocal microscopy image acquisition was carried out with the same instrumentation as in [ 25 ] . Exposure times varied between 500 and 1000 ms . TIRF / EPI experiments were performed using an inverted microscope ( Axiovert 200M ; Carl Zeiss , Thornwood , NY ) equipped with a Zeiss TIRF module and a 100× 1 , 45NA Zeiss TIRF lens . EPI fluorescence illumination was provided through Lambda DG - 4 illumination unit ( Sutter Instru - ments , Novato , CA ) . A 470 nm solid state laser ( Crystal lasers , Reno , NV ) was the source of illumination in TIRF . The measured penetration depth of the TIRF illumination was 90 nm . Endocytosis of the coated pits was quantified using normalized EPI and TIRF fluorescence profiles : fluorescence records were normalized to their maximum intensity , the area in between the EPI and TIRF fluores - cence traces after the peak in the EPI signal was measured as an indication of endocytosis . Image processing and analysis of dynamics of AP - 2 spots Particle identification was performed following criteria described previously [ 25 ] . All particle tracks were individu - ally validated . Calculation of several descriptors ( lifetime , maximal intensity distributions , etc . ) was performed using an image analysis application developed using Matlab 7 ( Mathworks , Natick , MA ) . 4037 E X P E R I M E N T A L C E L L R E S E A R C H 3 1 2 ( 2 0 0 6 ) 4 0 3 6 – 4 0 4 8 Results 1 - butanol blocks transferrin uptake by preventing the formation of clathrin - coated pits and vesicles Transferrin binds to its receptor , which is internalized by a clathrin - dependent pathway . A brief ( 5 min ) incubation of HeLa cells with 1 – 2 % 1 - butanol prevented the uptake of fluorescently labeled Alexa - 594 transferrin in a dose - depen - dent manner ( Figs . 1C – D ) . This endocytic block was signifi - cantly less pronounced in cells treated with t - butanol ( Figs . 1E – F ) . The effect of 1 - butanol is completely reversible , as shown by the full recovery of transferrin uptake monitored in cells following washout of the alcohol ( Figs . 1G – H ) . Analogous results were obtained with other primary alcohols such as 1 - propanol and ethanol ( data not shown ) . We then used live cell imaging [ 25 ] to follow the effect of 1 - butanol on the formation of coated pits and vesicles [ 25 ] . BSC1 cells display a character - istic punctate pattern at the plasma membrane , correspond - ing to coated pits and vesicles labeled here with EGFP - LCa ( for clathrin ) or σ 2 - EGFP ( for AP - 2 ) ( Fig . 2A , untreated , [ 25 ] ) . These punctate patterns are lost upon incubation with 2 % 1 - butanol ( Fig . 2A , 1 - butanol and Supplementary Movies 1 and 2 ) ; a similar effect was observed for other coated pit and coated vesicle components such as dynamin ( Fig . 2B ) or epsin and auxilin - 1 ( data not shown ) . Treatment with other primary alcohols such as 1 - propanol or ethanol led to a similar disappearance of coated pits and vesicles ( Fig . 2C ) . On the contrary , treatment with the secondary and tertiary alcohols 2 - propanol and t - butanol did not affect coated pits labeled with AP - 2 ( Fig . 2D ) . The disruptive effect of 1 - butanol on the formation of coated pits and vesicles is very fast , leading to the complete loss of coated structures within 5 – 7 s after alcohol addition . A representative kymograph for this experiment , performed with BSC1 cells simultaneously expressing σ 2 - EGFP and Tomato - LCa , shows the abrupt loss of both signals within seconds of exposing the cell to 2 % 1 - butanol ( Figs . 3A and B ) . Not only is appearance of new pits prevented , but also maturation of pits exposed to 1 - butanol during the growth phase stops , due to their rapid dissolution ( Fig . 3A ) . We used alternate imaging by total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) and wide - field epifluorescence ( EPI ) illumination to follow the fate of dissolving pits labeled with σ 2 - EGFP ( Figs . 3C – F ) . Loss of the TIRF signal before loss of its corresponding EPI signal reflects the normal pattern of the AP - 2 signal as the mature coated vesicle moves towards the cell interior and out of the evanescent field , just before uncoating ( Figs . 3C and E , untreated ) . In contrast , both TIRF and EPI signals disappeared together in dissolving pits of cells treated with 1 - butanol ( Figs . 3D and F , 1 - butanol ) , indicating that dissolution occurred at the plasma membrane and did not involve invagination . Similar results were obtained in cells expressing EGFP - LCa ( not shown ) . The disruptive effect of 1 - butanol on coated pits requires presence of a membrane beneath the clathrin coat , as shown by absence of coat dissolution in cells first bathed with hypertonic medium to induce the formation of clathrin micro - cages lacking enclosed vesicles [ 27 ] and then treated with 1 - butanol ( Fig . 3G , EGFP - LCa , sucrose ) . The acute effect of the 1 - butanol treatment also resulted in loss of the punctate pattern characteristic of the clathrin adaptors AP - 1 and AP - 3 , specific for the secretory pathway ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . In contrast , it had no detectable effect on the localization of proteins unlinked to clathrin coats such as caveolin - 1 - EGFP , β - COP - EGFP , ε - COP - EGFP and Rab22 - EGFP ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . 1 - butanol also had no significant effects on the localization of Arf1 - EGFP , on the organization of the Golgi apparatus as monitored with GalT - EGFP , or on chimeras of EGFP fused to protein domains that are targeted to membranes by their binding preferences to Fig . 1 – 1 - butanol blocks Tf uptake . ( A – F ) HeLa cells were pre incubated for 5 min at 37°C with PBS / Glucose / BSA ( PBS - GB ) ( A , B ) , PBS - GB with 1 . 5 % v / v 1 - butanol ( C ) , PBS - GB with 2 % v / v 1 - butanol ( D ) , PBS - GB with 1 . 5 % v / v t - butanol ( E ) , and PBS - GB with 2 % v / v t - butanol ( F ) ; followed by incubation with 10 μ g / ml Alexa594 - Tf for 2 min at RT ( B – F ) and 5 min at 37°C in therespectivemedia ( A – F ) ; cellsweresubsequentlytransferred to 4°C and acid washed with ( 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 125 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 1 M Glycine pH 2 . 5 ) . ( G – H ) HeLa cells were pre - incubatedwithmediaalone ( G ) orwith2 % v / v1 - butanol ( H ) for 5 min at 37°C , followed by an additional 5 min in media without 1 - butanol and Tf uptake and acid wash were carried out similarly as in panels A – F .

Thus , the inhibition of transferrin uptake induced by 1 - butanol treatment is readily explained by the disappearance of endocytic clathrin - coated pits and vesicles . Coated pits and coated vesicles reform upon washout of 1 - butanol The inhibition of transferrin uptake produced by 1 - butanol was reversed upon removal of the alcohol ( Fig . 1H ) , and this effect correlated with the reformation of clathrin - coated pits Fig . 2 – 1 - butanol and other primary alcohols disassemble clathrin - coated pits .

A burst of newly formed coated pits appeared within seconds of removing the 1 - butanol from the medium , and all of these new pits matured to form coated vesicles . BSC - 1 cells stably expressing EGFP - LCa or σ 2 - EGFP were first treated with 2 % v / v 1 - butanol for 1 min to remove all coated pits and vesicles . The medium bathing the cells was then exchanged with one lacking 1 - butanol , and the cells were imaged for up to 5 min . Within 1 min after initiation of the washout period we observed a transient ∼ 3 - fold increase in the surface density of newly formed coated pits , which corresponded to a similar increase in their formation rate ( Figs . 4A – B and Supplementary Movies 3 and 4 ) ; 3 – 5 min after Fig . 3 – 1 - butanol leads to the simultaneous disassembly of AP - 2 and clathrin without coated vesicle internalization .

All newly formed coated pits matured to endocytic coated vesicles , regardless of when the coat started to assemble , with characteristics similar to those observed in untreated cells ( Figs . 4C – D and Supplementary Fig . 4 – Washout of 1 - butanol results in a transient burst of coated pit nucleations .

Coated vesicles formed 1 min after initiation of the washout period had shorter lifetimes and were correspond - ingly smaller ( as determined by the maximum fluorescence intensity achieved just prior to the uncoating step [ 25 ] ) than those formed in the absence of the alcohol ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . The lifetimes and sizes of the coated vesicles formed subsequently were indistinguishable from those of untreated cells . We found similar disassembly and reformation of coated pits upon treatment with 1 - butanol and after its washout , respectively , in U373MG astrocytes and in HeLa cells stably expressing EGFP - LCa ( not shown ) or σ 2 - EGFP ( Figs . 4E and F ; and Supplementary Movie 6 ) . The washout of the other primary alcohols ethanol and 1 - propanol also led to synchro - nous reformation of coated pits and vesicles ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Liposomes containing phosphoinositide - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate allow the formation of coated pits and vesicles in cells treated with 1 - butanol If the loss of clathrin - coated pit / vesicle assembly is a specific consequence of PIP2 depletion induced by the 1 - butanol treatment , then replenishing cells with exogenous PIP2 in the presence of 1 - butanol should rescue coated pit formation and endocytosis . We tested this hypothesis by treating BSC - 1 cells stably expressing σ 2 - EGFP with 2 % v / v 1 - butanol for 1 min to produce a complete loss of coated pits and vesicles . Subsequent imaging of the cells in the presence of the alcohol but after incubation with liposomes ( 50 μ g / ml final concentra - tion ) containing a mixture of 5 % PIP2 , 45 % phosphatidyl - ethanolamine ( PE ) and 50 % phosphatidyl - choline ( PC ) showed a complete recovery of the formation of coated pits and vesicles , beginning as early as one min after exposure to the liposomes ( Figs . 5A and B and Supplementary Movie 7 ) . Coated vesicles that formed under this condition had an average lifetime ( 35±11 s , Fig . 5C ) , very similar to that found in the absence of the alcohol ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . The control experiment , done by adding liposomes containing equimolar amounts of ( PE ) and ( PC ) but lacking PIP2 showed no recovery of coated pit and coated vesicle formation ( Figs . 5A and B , control liposomes ) . We conclude from these observations that the PIP2 delivered by the liposomes was sufficient to correct the biosynthetic defect of PIP2 elicited by 1 - butanol , and that PIP2 is essential for clathrin - coated pit and coated vesicle formation . Inhibition of actin polymerization leads to formation of AP - 2 clusters and a reduction in coated pits and vesicles After verifying that 1 - butanol treatment ( up to 20 min ) does not affect actin polymerization ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , we used the synchronization of coated pit formation after removal of 1 - butanol as a tool to investigate further the role of actin polymerization in the endocytic event . Actin poly - merization was inhibited by sequestering actin monomers with Latrunculin B ( LatB ) ( Fig . 6 ) or Latrunculin A ( LatA ) ( Supplementary Fig . 5 , left panels ) , or by capping the growing end of actin fibers with Cytochalasin D ( CytoD ) ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 5 right panels ) . Incubation of BSC1 cells with LatB ( 2 . 5 μ g / ml ) resulted in a progressive accumulation of AP - 2 structures that appeared larger than diffraction limit ( high - lighted in the bottom region of Fig . 6A , LatB ) , indicating that they may correspond to clusters of coated pits or coated vesicles unresolved from each other , as previously suggested [ 19 ] . About 60 % of the membrane - bound AP - 2 had accumu - lated in these structures ( Figs . 6A and B ) after 15 min of incubation with LatB ( a time at which no more actin stress fibers could be detected , Supplementary Fig . 3 , LatB ) . The AP - 2 content of the majority of these structures was 3 – 4 times higher than the amount contained in the largest coated vesicles formed during normal conditions ( Fig . 6B ) . At this point , we also observed ∼ 50 % reduction in the formation rate of new coated pits ( Fig . 6C ) . The growth characteristics of the remaining pits and vesicles as defined by their maximum size and lifetime remained unchanged , however , even when the cells were exposed to LatB for 25 min ( Fig . 6D , Supplementary Movie 8 ) . We observed a similar accumulation of relatively static coat structures paralleled by the progressive decrease of coated pits and vesicles , which nonetheless exhibited normal dynamics , in cells extensively treated with LatA or Cytocho - lasin D ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton affects coated motility and alters the spatial distribution of coated pit formation As reported by Gaidarov et al . [ 30 ] , depolymerization of actin had a marked effect on the movement of coated pits . In control cells , coated pits , tracked in their growing phase ( initial 20 s ) , displayed an average immediate velocity ( Euclidian displacement of the centroid divided by time ) of 0 . 032±0 . 011 μ m / s ( Fig . 7A ) . The displacement of the coated pits was linearly correlated with the square root of time , as is characteristic of a two - dimensional random walk ( Fig . 7B and Supplementary Figs . 6B and D ) ; the overall displacement of ∼ 150 nm was well within the endocytic permissive zones previously observed in BSC1 cells [ 25 ] . Inhibition of actin polymerization by LatB ( Fig . 7A ) , LatA or CytoD treatment ( Supplementary Figs . 6A and C ) led to increases in both the average immediate velocity of coated pits ( to ∼ 0 . 087± 0 . 017 μ m / s ) and their average displacement , which became ∼ 500 nm ( Fig . 7B and Supplementary Figs . 6B and D ) , but these motions were correlated within neighborhoods , as if due to some concerted displacement of the plasma membrane . Furthermore , depolymerization of the cytoskeleton led to an increase in the clustering of sites of formation of coated pits . In the absence of polymerized actin there is an increase in the probability of formation of an additional coated pit at a given distance from any coated pit ( as measured by the Ripley ’ s L function calculated with PASSAGE software , [ 31 ] ) , over an increased radius ( Fig . 7C ) . These observations are consistent with the dissolution of local barriers in the context of the maintenance of the overall ratio of areas in which coated pits can or cannot form . Normal coated pits and vesicles reform in the absence of polymerized actin upon 1 - butanol washout The variable effects of actin disassembly on coated pit and coated vesicle formation have made it difficult to reach a 4042 E X P E R I M E N T A L C E L L R E S E A R C H 3 1 2 ( 2 0 0 6 ) 4 0 3 6 – 4 0 4 8 simple interpretation linking the actin and clathrin systems . Therefore , we took advantage of the significantly more rapid effects of 1 - butanol on coated pit and coated vesicle dynamics as a way to facilitate the analysis . As in control cells , we found that 1 - butanol led to rapid and complete disappearance of AP - 2 structures in cells pre - incubated with LatB ( Fig . 6A ) . When the 1 - butanol was removed from cells in the continued presence of the actin polymerization inhibitory compounds , new coated pits and vesicles promptly appeared ( Fig . 6A ) . The dynamics of these assembling pits and vesicles were Fig . 5 – Liposomes containing phosphoinositide - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate allow the formation of coated pits and vesicles in cells treated with 1 - butanol .

The uptake of transferrin , which was partially inhibited in the presence of LatB , recovered to 60 – 80 % of control values during the first minutes of the 1 - butanol washout period , followed by a sharp reduction 15 min later if LatB remained in the medium . A similar experiment using t - butanol did not activate the uptake of transferrin after washing the alcohol ( Fig . 7E ) , as expected for a compound that has no effect on coated pit and vesicle formation . Discussion We have addressed here the role of PIP2 and actin on coated pit and coated vesicle formation , using as an experimental tool the rapid and acute effect of primary alcohols on assembly and disassembly of endocytic clathrin structures . The primary alcohols , 1 - butanol , 1 - propanol and ethanol , all had the same three effects on the formation of clathrin coats at the plasma membrane : ( 1 ) they induced rapid disassembly of existing coated pits ; ( 2 ) they inhibited formation of new ones ; ( 3 ) their removal caused a transient increase in the number of new coated pits and vesicles that formed immediately after washout . The first two effects are probably caused by specific interference with the activity of PLD and to a lesser extent by more general inhibitory effects related to alcohols in general . The third effect , significant upregulation of the formation of new pits , probably comes from reversing the inhibition of PLD activity . Exposure of PLD to primary alcohols results in the production of phosphatidyl alcohol instead of PA , thus creating an imbalance in the production of PIP2 mediated by PI5K , itself activated by PA . We propose that the resulting acute reduction in PIP2 ( or of other phosphoinositides whose biosynthesis is linked to PIP2 ) not only impairs the nuclea - tion and recruitment of coat components required to initiate and sustain coated pit assembly but also promotes dissolu - tion of coat components from pits before they complete assembly into mature coated vesicles . In support of a direct role of PIP2 in coat formation , we show that , in the continued presence of 1 - butanol , addition of PIP2 containing liposomes leads to uptake of PIP2 and rapid recovery of normal coated structures . A number of proteins that regulate coat formation are known to interact with phosphoinositides . The best char - acterized are the tetrameric AP - 2 and the monomeric CALM clathrin adaptors , present in all endocytic coated pits and vesicles . Their interactions with PIP2 are mediated by lipid binding sites located at the N - terminus of α - adaptin and of CALM , respectively ; mutations in these lipid binding sites reduce their targeting to clathrin - coated pits and vesicles . A decrease in PIP2 levels could therefore reduce the ability to recruit AP - 2 or CALM ( or some of other protein ) to sites of coat assembly . Dissolution of coats , through inhibition of PLD by 1 - butanol , probably reflects a release of AP - 2 from the membrane together with clathrin triskelions bound to them ; it is unlikely that such dissolution occurs by an activation of the standard uncoating process , however . Standard uncoating sustained by coated vesicles requires Hsc70 and its co - factor auxilin , a process marked by a burst in the recruitment of auxilin to fully assembled coated vesicles just prior to their uncoating [ 32 , 33 ] ; in contrast , auxilin is not recruited to disappearing coated pits in cells treated with 1 - butanol ( not shown ) . Knockdown by RNAi of PLD2 inhibits transferrin recycling from endosomes back to the cell surface , but knockdown of PLD1 or PLD2 does not prevent transferrin internalization [ 34 ] . It is hard to correlate these observations directly with the data presented here , as the RNAi experiments were performed in a much longer time frame ( days ) than ours ( minutes ) . It is possible , for example , that cells exposed to a long term perturbation in their PLD activity respond by upregulating other enzymes to compensate for the defect ; indeed such compensation has been observed upon depletion by RNAi of different PIP5K isoforms [ 6 ] . The onset of the reversal in the inhibition of coated pit assembly is rapid and starts 5 – 7 s after removal of the primary alcohols ; the frequency of new coated pits appearing during the first minutes of the reversal is always higher than in untreated cells . This transient increase can be explained by an overshoot in the amount of available PIP2 at the onset of the wash period . The temporary increase of PIP2 could be generated , if for example , PI4P , the substrate of PIP5K , accumulated during the 1 - butanol treatment because of lack of consumption by inactive PIP5K ; upon removal of 1 - butanol , PIP5K is stimulated again by freshly synthesized PA , leading to a temporary increase in the amount of PIP2 . This model has been proposed as an explanation for the overshoot in actin dynamics observed in Dictyostelium upon removal of 1 - butanol [ 35 ] . Previous studies focused on understanding the role of actin in coated pit and coated vesicle formation have linked actin dynamics with clathrin function [ 6 , 16 – 19 , 23 , 24 , 30 , 36 – 38 ] . Highlights of these studies include : ( 1 ) transient capture of actin , particularly at late stages in the formation of a coated pit / vesicle [ 17 – 19 ] ; ( 2 ) co - localization of actin binding proteins such as cortactin , Hip1R and N - WASP [ 39 ] with clathrin structures , but only partial inhibition of endocytosis during RNAi knockdown of these proteins [ 36 , 37 , 40 ] ; ( 3 ) variable inhibition of transferrin uptake and clathrin dynamics in cells treated with compounds that interfere with actin dynamics [ 18 , 19 , 23 , 24 , 36 ] . We have confirmed that treatment of cells with agents that prevent actin dynamics hinders assembly of clathrin - coated pits and vesicles and endocytosis of transferrin . We find that the inhibitory effects are progressive : they become more apparent with longer exposure to the actin - polymerization inhibiters . If actin polymerization is required for coated vesicle formation , we expected that cells first treated for an extensive period with LatB , in order to achieve a severe block in coated pit assembly , followed by 1 - butanol , to eliminate the remain - ing pits , would not form new coated pits and vesicles upon removal of the alcohol . Instead , we observed exactly the opposite : recovery of transferrin uptake , accompanying the reappearance of new coated pits , which matured to form coated vesicles following normal assembly dynamics . The period of efficient coated pit formation lasted several minutes , until the cells eventually reverted to the regime with decreased frequency of new pits and reappearance of cla - thrin / AP - 2 clusters , as observed under conditions of extensive 4046 E X P E R I M E N T A L C E L L R E S E A R C H 3 1 2 ( 2 0 0 6 ) 4 0 3 6 – 4 0 4 8 actin depolymerization . These results lead us to conclude that actin does not have an essential role in any of the events required to form a coated vesicle , including nucleation , assembly of the coat , budding of the underlying membrane to form the mature coated vesicle and uncoating . Nonetheless , sustained coat assembly fails in the absence of a functional actin cytoskeleton . It is thought that the actin cytoskeleton helps define regions of constrained lateral diffusion for proteins and lipids at the plasma membrane by imposing actin - based barriers [ 41 ] . Presence of such corrals might impose a diffusion barrier to phosphoinositides generated locally , thus favoring an increase in their local concentration that might facilitate recruitment of lipid - binding coat components . In BSC1 cells , the regions where assembly of coated pits occurs can be modeled by permissive zones of 200 to 400 nm in diameter , surrounded by rings of 100 nm in width that are inactive [ 25 ] . Similar active regions are observed in many types of cells in culture , including HeLa , COS , U373MG astrocytes [ 25 , 33 ] , as well as in primary adipocytes [ 42 ] . Our modeling is consistent with electron microscopic observa - tions that show the presence of endocytic zones , which contain pits , intercalated with regions rich in cytoskeleton and devoid of coated pits [ 24 ] . Santini and colleagues showed that G - protein coupled receptor activation generated a localized increase within , “ coated pit zones , ” in the number of coated pits , a phenomenon that was dependent on the presence of a functional actin cytoskeleton [ 43 ] . Relaxation of barriers by extensive actin depolymerization creates a new situation with large patches of membrane accessible to coat assembly , but where the local lipid concentration is lower than the required threshold to ensure efficient nucleation and capture of coat components . This adjustment would result in a decrease in the frequency of coated pits , and those that form would start at localized regions with sufficient local accumulation of lipids to sustain assembly as detected by the increase in pit clustering . Relaxation of the actin barriers has the additional effect of reducing the frequency of new coats appearing during the early stages of alcohol washout , as expected if the same amounts of lipids , but at a lower concentration , are recovered in a larger unconstrained region .
