Within SAGA , the Atxn7 amino terminus anchors Non - stop , a deubiquitinase , to the complex . To understand the scope of Atxn7 - dependent regulation of Non - stop , substrates of the deubiquitinase were sought . This revealed Non - stop , dissociated from Atxn7 , interacts with Arp2 / 3 and WAVE regulatory complexes ( WRC ) , which control actin cytoskeleton assembly . There , Non - stop countered polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of WRC subunit SCAR . Dependent on conserved WRC interacting receptor sequences ( WIRS ) , Non - stop augmentation increased protein levels , and directed subcellular localization , of SCAR , decreasing cell area and number of protrusions . In vivo , heterozygous mutation of SCAR did not significantly rescue knockdown of Atxn7 , but heterozygous mutation of Atxn7 rescued haploinsufficiency of SCAR .

Within SAGA , the Ataxin - 7 ( Atxn7 ) amino - terminus anchors the deubiquitinase module ( DUBm ) to the larger complex ( Lee et al . , 2009 ) . Mutation of Atxn7 and non - stop leads to aberrant gene expression , defective non - homologous end joining , decreased immune response , reduced replicative lifespan , neurodegeneration , blindness , tumorigenesis , and cancer ( Glinsky et al . , 2005 ; Weake et al . , 2008 ; McCormick et al . , 2014 ; Lang et al . , 2011 ; Bonnet et al . , 2014 ; Furrer et al . , 2011 ; Li et al . , 2018 ; Mohan et al . , 2014a ) . The progressive retinal and neurodegenerative disease Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 7 ( SCA7 ) is caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion of the ATXN7 gene , resulting in polyglutamine ( polyQ ) expansion at the amino terminus of the Atxn7 protein ( Giunti et al . , 1999 ; David et al . , 1997 ) . SCA7 disease is characterized by progressive cone - rod dystrophy leading to blindness , and progressive degeneration of the spine and cerebellum ( Martin , 2012 ; Garden , 1993 ) . Cloud et al . eLife 2019 ; 8 : e49677 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 49677 1 of 35 RESEARCH ARTICLE In Drosophila , loss of Atxn7 leads to a phenotype similar to overexpression of the polyQ - expanded amino terminal truncation of human Atxn7 ( Latouche et al . , 2007 ) – reduced life span , reduced mobility , and retinal degeneration ( Mohan et al . , 2014a ) . Without Atxn7 , the Drosophila DUBm is released , enzymatically active , from SAGA . Once released , the module acts as a gain - of - function , leading to reduced ubiquitination of H2B . Similarly , the mammalian DUBm binds and deu - biquitinates substrates without Atxn7 in vitro , albeit at a lower rate ( Lan et al . , 2015 ; Yang et al . , 2015 ) . Consistent with Non - stop release and over activity mediating the Drosophila Atxn7 loss - of - function phenotype , reducing non - stop copy number alleviates lethality associated with loss of Atxn7 ( Mohan et al . , 2014a ) . Non - stop is a critical mediator of retinal axon guidance and important for glial cell survival ( Weake et al . , 2008 ; Martin et al . , 1995 ) . Interestingly , abnormal ubiquitin signaling in the nervous system contributes to a number of genetic and spontaneous neurological and retinal diseases , including SCA3 , SCAR16 , Alzheimer’s , Parkinson’s , ALS , and Huntington’s disease ( Petrucelli and Dawson , 2004 ; Campello et al . , 2013 ; Mohan et al . , 2014b ) . Few functions are known for the DUBm beyond deubiquitination of H2Bub , H2Aub , shelterin , and FBP1 ( Atanassov and Dent , 2011 ; Atanassov et al . , 2009 ) . In polyQ - Atxn7 overexpression models , sequestration of the DUBm may result in reduced deubiquitinase activity on critical substrates . Interestingly , both increased and decreased H2Bub have been shown to hinder gene expression , and imbalances ( whether up or down ) in ubiquitination are observed in retinal and neurological diseases ( Ristic et al . , 2014 ) . Together , these data suggest more needs to be understood about Atxn7 - mediated regulation of DUBm function . To better understand the Non - stop - Atxn7 regulatory axis , we set out to identify substrates for Non - stop and determine the consequence of Atxn7 loss on Non - stop / substrate interactions . To this end , we purified Non - stop - containing complexes , fractionated them by size , and tested enzymatic activity to identify novel complexes bearing enzymatically active Non - stop . This revealed the func - tionally active DUBm associates with protein complexes distinct from SAGA . Mass spectrometry revealed Arp2 / 3 complex and Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) - family verprolin homolo - gous protein ( WAVE ) Regulatory Complex ( WRC ) members suppressor of extracellular cAMP recep - tor ( cAR ) ( SCAR ) , HEM protein ( Hem ) , and specifically Rac1 - associated protein 1 ( Sra - 1 ) , as interaction partners of the independent DUBm . These complexes function together to initiate actin branching ( Kurisu and Takenawa , 2009 ) . Pull - down and immunofluorescence verified interaction and revealed extensive colocalization between Non - stop and WRC subunit SCAR . In flies , loss of Atxn7 led to increased interaction between Non - stop and SCAR . In cells and in flies , loss of Atxn7 resulted in a 2 . 5 - fold increase in SCAR protein levels , while loss of Non - stop led to 70 % decrease in SCAR protein levels . Spatiotemporal regulation of SCAR is essential for maintain - ing cytoskeletal organization . A constant ubiquitination - proteasomal degradation mechanism con - tributes to establishing and maintaining SCAR protein amount . Mutating the Non - stop enzymatic pocket to increase affinity for ubiquitin led to increased interaction with SCAR . An alternative enzy - matic pocket mutation decreasing affinity for ubiquitin reduced interaction with SCAR . When Non - stop was knocked - down in cells , the amount of ubiquitinated SCAR increased . Loss of SCAR in Non - stop mutants was rescued by proteasome inhibition , suggesting Non - stop counters SCAR polyubi - quitination and proteasomal degradation . An emerging class of proteins , important for neural function and stability bear WRC interacting receptor sequences ( WIRS ) which contribute to direct interaction and spatiotemporal regulation of SCAR ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . Close examination of Non - stop amino acid sequence revealed conserved WIRS motifs in Drosophila and human Non - stop orthologues . Mutating these decreased Non - stop - SCAR interaction , but allowed Non - stop to assemble into SAGA . Overexpression of Non - stop increased total SCAR protein levels approximately 5 - fold . Interest - ingly , SCAR protein levels increased in cellular compartments where Non - stop increased , including in the nucleus . When SCAR protein levels were increased and relocalized by augmenting Non - stop , local F - actin amounts increased too , leading to cell rounding and fewer cell protrusions . Mutation of Non - stop WIRS motifs reduced Non - stop ability to increase SCAR protein , F - actin , and to reduce cellular protrusions . Although SCAR heterozygosity was not sufficient to rescue defective retinal axon targeting upon Atxn7 knockdown , loss of Atxn7 was sufficient to rescue loss of F - actin in SCAR heterozygotes .

The resultant retinal and neurodegenerative phenotype is rescued by reducing non - stop yet it is inconsistent with phenotypes arising from muta - tions in other regulators of H2B ubiquitination , such as Drosophila homolog of RAD6 ( Dhr6 ) ( the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme ) , Bre1 ( E3 ubiquitin ligase ) , or Ubiquitin - specific protease 7 ( USP7 ) ( H2B deconjugating enzyme ) ( van der Knaap et al . , 2005 ; van der Knaap et al . , 2010 ; Tsou et al . , 2012 ; Haddad et al . , 2013 ; Mohan et al . , 2010 ; Koken et al . , 1991 ; Bray et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore , we sought novel interaction partners for Non - stop ( Figure 1A ) . To this end , an unbiased biochemical screen was deployed to specifically identify protein complexes stably interacting with enzymatically active DUBm ( Figure 1B ) . Drosophila S2 cells were stably transfected with a pRmHA3 - based induc - ible expression vector to produce epitope - tagged Non - stop - 2xFLAG - 2xHA ( Non - stop - FH ) ( Mohan et al . , 2014a ; Cherbas et al . , 2011 ; Guelman et al . , 2006 ; Kusch et al . , 2004 ; Suganuma et al . , 2008 ; Bunch et al . , 1988 ) . Whole cell extracts were prepared from these cell lines and immunoblotted to verify they expressed amounts of Non - stop comparable to wild - type cells ( Figure 1C , Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Non - stop - containing protein complexes were purified from nuclear extracts via tandem affinity purification of their epitope tags : FLAG , then HA ( Suganuma et al . , 2010 ) . The complexity of these samples were assessed by silver stain ( Figure 1D ) . Isolated complexes from SAGA subunits Atxn7 and Will Decrease Acetylation ( WDA ) are shown for comparison ( Mohan et al . , 2014a ) . Although similar in profile to Atxn7 and WDA purifications , Non - stop - containing complexes were unique , indi - cating Non - stop has novel interaction partners . To separate SAGA from other Non - stop - interacting protein complexes , purified complexes were separated by size using Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography ( Figure 1E , upper ) ( Kusch et al . , 2003 ) . For comparison purposes , data for Atxn7 and Ada2B are reproduced here ( Mohan et al . , 2014a ) . Atxn7 and Ada2b are SAGA - specific subunits . Their elution from the gel - filtration column indicates those fractions contain SAGA ( Mohan et al . , 2014a ; Kusch et al . , 2003 ) . Non - stop eluted in additional fractions ( Figure 1E , upper ) . To determine which fractions contained enzymatically active Non - stop , the ubiquitin - AMC deubi - quitinase activity assay was performed , in which the fluorescent probe AMC is initially quenched by conjugation to ubiquitin but fluoresces when released by deubiquitination , permitting an indirect measurement of the relative amount of deubiquitination occurring in each sample ( Figure 1E , lower ) ( Ko¨hler et al . , 2010 ; Samara et al . , 2010 ) . In complexes purified through Atxn7 , peak deubiquiti - nase activity was detected around 1 . 8MDa , consistent with SAGA complex and previous purification , fractionation , and mass spectrometry of Atxn7 , which is reproduced here for purposes of compari - son ( Mohan et al . , 2014a ; Kusch et al . , 2003 ; Lee et al . , 2011 ) . In Non - stop purifications , however , deubiquitinase activity resolved into three major peaks . The major activity peak resolved at about 1 . 8 MDa , along with SAGA , and was labeled ‘Group 1’ . A secondary peak , ‘Group 2’ , was resolved centering approximately 669 kDa , which was interpreted to be non - SAGA large multi - protein com - plexes . A final peak with the lowest enzymatic activity , centering about 75 kDa , was labeled ‘Group 3 . ’ The DUBm , consisting of Non - stop , Sgf11 , and E ( y ) 2 are predicted to have a molecular mass of 88 kDa , meaning this last peak was the DUBm interacting with very small proteins , if any . Silver stain - ing of a single fraction at the center of Group 2 revealed the fractionation procedure resolved com - plexes into a pattern distinct from the total input ( Figure 1E , right ) . The three fractions comprising the center of each peak were combined , and MudPIT mass spec - trometry was performed to identify their protein constituents ( Washburn et al . , 2001 ) . MudPit pro - teomics provides a distributed normalized spectral abundance factor ( dNSAF ) which acts as a reporter for relative protein amount within a sample ( Washburn et al . , 2001 ) . Consistent with previ - ous characterizations of SAGA , Group 1 contained SAGA complex subunits from each of the major ( HAT / TAF / SPT / DUB ) modules ( Mohan et al . , 2014a ; Kusch et al . , 2003 ; ; Lee et al . , 2011 ; Setiaputra et al . , 2015 ) . Group 2 was selected for further interrogation because it was predicted to contain non - SAGA large multi - protein complexes . Group 2 contained the DUBm : Non - stop , Sgf11 , and E ( y ) 2 – indicating the DUBm remained intact during purification and fractionation ( Ko¨hler et al . , 2010 ; Samara et al . , 2010 ; Lee et al . , 2011 ) . Histone H2A and H2B were also detected in Group 2 , Cloud et al . eLife 2019 ; 8 : e49677 .

Furthermore , Non - stop dNSAF was not over - represented relative to Sgf11 and E ( y ) 2 , further confirming Non - stop bait protein was not expressed beyond physiological levels ( Figure 2A ) ( Zhang et al . , 2010 ) . Non - stop co - purifies with Arp2 / 3 and WRC complexes Notably , within Group 2 , Arp2 / 3 complex ( all subunits ) and WRC subunits SCAR , Hem , and Sra - 1 were represented in high ratio to DUBm members , as determined by dNSAF ( Figure 2A ) ( Pollard and Beltzner , 2002 ; Chen et al . , 2010 ) . WRC complex activates Arp2 / 3 to promote actin branching , which is important for a range of cel - lular activities including cell migration , cell adhesion , exocytosis , endocytosis , maintenance of nuclear shape , and phagocytosis ( Zallen et al . , 2002 ; Takenawa and Miki , 2001 ; Alekhina et al . , 2017 ; Navarro - Le´rida et al . , 2015 ; Vishavkarma et al . , 2014 ; Verboon et al . , 2015 ) . Non - stop and Atxn7 - containing complexes were purified from nuclear extracts , where their function in gene regu - lation is best characterized . WRC and Arp2 / 3 function in the nucleus is more enigmatic . Although Arp2 / 3 and WRC have demonstrated nuclear functions , their roles in actin branching in the cyto - plasm are better understood ( Navarro - Le´rida et al . , 2015 ; Verboon et al . , 2015 ; Yoo et al . , 2007 ; Rawe et al . , 2004 ; Miyamoto et al . , 2013 ) . SAGA , WRC , and Arp2 / 3 complexes are all critical for proper central nervous system function , making the regulatory intersection for these complexes intriguing for further study ( Zallen et al . , 2002 ; Meyer and Feldman , 2002 ; Chou and Wang , 2016 ; Dumpich et al . , 2015 ; Kessels et al . , 2011 ; Irie and Yamaguchi , 2004 ) . In Drosophila , SCAR is particularly important for cytoplasmic organization in the blastoderm , for egg chamber structure during oogenesis , axon development in the central nervous system , and adult eye morphology ( Zallen et al . , 2002 ) . To further characterize the relationship between Non - stop , Atxn7 , and WRC , we turned to the BG3 cell line ( ML - DmBG3 - c2 , RRID : CVCL _ Z728 ) . These cells were derived from the Drosophila 3 rd instar larval central nervous system . Biochemical and RNAseq profiling of these cells indicate they express genes associated with the central nervous system . Their morphology is similar to that of Drosophila CNS primary cultured cells ( Cherbas et al . , 2011 ; Ui et al . , 1994 ) . To verify interaction between Non - stop and WRC , BG3 cells were transiently transfected with either Non - stop - FH or SCAR - FLAG - HA ( SCAR - FH ) and immunoprecipitated using anti - FLAG resin . Anti - HA antibody was used to verify pull down of the tagged protein . A previously verified anti - SCAR antibody confirmed the presence of SCAR in Non - stop - FH immunoprecipitate ( Figure 2B ) ( Verboon et al . , 2015 ; Rodriguez - Mesa et al . , 2012 ; Cetera et al . , 2014 ; Tran et al . , 2015 ; Verboon and Parkhurst , 2015 ) . Reciprocal immunoprecipitation of SCAR - FH utilizing an anti - FLAG resin followed by immunoblotting for Non - stop using an anti - Non - stop antibody confirmed SCAR - FH associated with endogenous Non - stop ( Figure 2C ) ( Mohan et al . , 2014a ) . To visualize the scope of Non - stop and WRC colocalization , indirect immunofluorescence was used to localize endogenous SCAR and Non - stop in BG3 cells . BG3 cells were plated on concanava - lin A coated coverslips giving them an appearance similar to S2 cells plated on concanavalin A ( Rogers et al . , 2003 ) ( Figure 2D ) . SCAR localized in a characteristic pattern with high concentrations Figure 1 continued transfected cell lines .

The complexity of eluted fractions was analyzed and Group 2 peak fraction , number 14 , is shown ( right ) .

Recombinant Non - stop was Figure 2 continued on next page Cloud et al . eLife 2019 ; 8 : e49677 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 49677 6 of 35 Research article Cell Biology Neuroscience around the nucleus and at the cell periphery ( Rogers et al . , 2003 ) . Non - stop localized similarly to SCAR , but also further within nuclei . Examination of the spatial relationship between Non - stop and F - actin , using phalloidin , revealed Non - stop overlapping with portions of F - actin / phalloidin ( Figure 2E ) ( Cooper , 1987 ) . Atxn7 and Non - stop coordinate SCAR protein levels Atxn7 loss releases Non - stop from SAGA and is lethal , although , lethality is rescued by reducing Non - stop gene copy number . This implies a class of Non - stop target ( s ) , which associate more with Non - stop in the absence of Atxn7 . Furthermore , it raises the possibility that a subset of these may contribute to toxicity resulting from Atxn7 loss ( Mohan et al . , 2014a ) . To determine if interaction between Non - stop and SCAR is regulated by Atxn7 , endogenous Non - stop was immunoprecipitated from either wild - type or Atxn7 - mutant 3 rd instar larval whole cell extracts . Immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted to detect endogenous SCAR protein . In Atxn7 mutant extracts , approximately 1 . 4 times more SCAR was present per Non - stop captured ( Figure 3A , right ) . This suggests Atxn7 retains a pool of Non - stop that can be freed to interact with SCAR . If Non - stop was acting as a SCAR deubiquitinase to counter proteolytic degradation , then loss of Atxn7 would lead to increased SCAR protein . Conversely , reducing Non - stop would lead to less SCAR protein . To test these hypotheses , RNAi was used to knock down Non - stop or Atxn7 tran - scripts in cell culture and SCAR protein levels were observed by immunoblotting . BG3 cells were soaked in dsRNA targeting LacZ ( negative control ) , Non - stop , or Atxn7 . After six days , denaturing whole cell protein extracts were prepared from these cells and immunoblotted to detect SCAR . Pon - ceau S total protein stain was used as loading control to verify analysis of equal amounts of protein ( Romero - Calvo et al . , 2010 ; Lee et al . , 2016 ) . Protein extracts from Non - stop knockdown cells con - sistently showed approximately 70 % decrease in SCAR protein levels relative to LacZ control knock - down . Consistent with a model in which Atxn7 restrains Non - stop deubiquitinase activity , cells treated with Atxn7 - targeting RNAs showed 2 . 5 - fold increase in SCAR protein ( Figure 3B ) . We veri - fied these results by immunoblotting whole cell extracts prepared from the brains of 3 rd instar larvae bearing homozygous mutations for Atxn7 ( Ataxin7 [ KG02020 ] ) , a loss - of - function allele ( Mohan et al . , 2014a ) or non - stop ( not 02069 ) , also a loss of function allele ( Poeck et al . , 2001 ) . Larval brain extracts from Atxn7 mutants showed about 2 . 5 - fold increase in SCAR protein levels ( Figure 3C ) . In non - stop mutant extracts SCAR was decreased approximately 75 % ( Figure 3C ) . SAGA was first identified as a chromatin modifying complex and predominantly characterized as a transcriptional coactivator . Therefore , we examined whether Non - stop influences SCAR gene expression . In genome wide analysis of glial nuclei isolated from mutant larvae , SCAR transcript was significantly down regulated by one fold in Non - stop deficient glia , but not in Sgf11 deficient glia ( Ma et al . , 2016 ) . Since Sgf11 is required for Non - stop enzymatic activity , it is not clear what mecha - nism links Non - stop loss to reduction in SCAR gene expression . To confirm the relationship between Non - stop and SCAR gene expression , we used qRT - PCR to measure SCAR transcript levels in BG3 cells knocked - down for non - stop . We found a similar one half decrease in SCAR transcript levels ( Figure 3D ) . However , examination of Atxn7 knockdown showed no decrease in SCAR transcript lev - els ( Figure 3D ) . Therefore , while non - stop loss leads to modest decreases in SCAR transcripts , SCAR gene expression is independent of Atxn7 or Sgf11 , suggesting this gene is not SAGA - dependent or dependent on Non - stop enzymatic activity . To determine the consequences of reducing SCAR tran - scripts by half on SCAR protein levels , we examined SCAR heterozygous mutant larval brains Figure 2 continued immunoprecipitated using anti - FLAG affinity resin and purified interactors analyzed by immunoblotting for the presence of endogenous SCAR .

To compare the relative proportion of SCAR Figure 3 continued on next page Cloud et al . eLife 2019 ; 8 : e49677 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 49677 8 of 35 Research article Cell Biology Neuroscience ( SCAR [ Delta37 ] / + ) . qRT - PCR analysis showed heterozygous SCAR brains produced 40 % less SCAR transcript than wild - type brains ( Figure 3E ) . However , heterozygous SCAR mutant and wild - type brains showed similar amounts of SCAR protein , demonstrating this amount of transcript is sufficient for full protein production ( Figure 3F ) . Since non - stop mutants showed a similarly modest decrease in SCAR gene expression but a drastic decrease in protein levels , we tested the possibility that Non - stop counters SCAR protein degradation post - translationally . Purification and mass spectrometry identified WRC members SCAR , HEM , and SRA - 1 , as interac - tion partners of the independent DUBm ( Figure 2A ) . In Drosophila , HEM , SRA - 1 , and Abi recruit an unidentified deubiquitinase to balance SCAR regulation through a constant ubiquitination - proteaso - mal degradation mechanism facilitating rapid changes in SCAR protein amount and localization ( Chen et al . , 2014 ; Kunda et al . , 2003 ) . In mammals , the USP7 deubiquitinase acts as a molecular rheostat controlling proteasomal degradation of WASH ( Hao et al . , 2015 ) . To probe whether ubiquitinated SCAR is a substrate for Non - stop , the substrate binding pocket of Non - stop was modified to either augment ( Non - stop ( C406A ) ) , or reduce ( Non - stop ( C406S ) ) sub - strate binding ( Morrow et al . , 2018 ) . These mutants were immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts prepared from transiently transfected BG3 cells . Immunoblotting revealed that Non - stop ( C406A ) bound to SCAR approximately 4 - fold more than wild - type Non - stop while Non - stop ( C406S ) bound only about 1 / 3 rd as well ( Figure 4A and B , upper panels ) . To verify both mutants incorpo - rated into SAGA , interaction with Ada2b was confirmed ( Figure 4A and B , lower panels ) . Entry into the proteasome for destruction can be triggered by polyubiquitination ( Grice and Nathan , 2016 ; Meulmeester et al . , 2005 ) . To determine whether Non - stop counters polyubiquitina - tion of SCAR , HA - ubiquitin and SCAR - FLAG were expressed in BG3 cells and either LacZ ( negative control ) or non - stop were knocked down followed by a brief period of proteasomal inhibition to pre - serve polyubiquitinated SCAR which would otherwise be rapidly destroyed by the proteasome ( Xia et al . , 2012 ) . Immunoprecipitation of SCAR followed by immunoblotting with a ubiquitin - spe - cific antibody revealed that knock - down of Non - stop nearly tripled levels of SCAR polyubiquitination ( Figure 4C ) . To determine whether Non - stop regulates SCAR entry into a proteasomal degradation pathway 3 rd instar larval brains were cultured ex vivo to permit pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome in defined genetic backgrounds ( Rabinovich et al . , 2015 ; Prithviraj et al . , 2012 ) . Wandering 3 rd instar larval brains were isolated from non - stop homozygous mutant larvae and cultured for 24 hr in the presence of MG132 proteasome inhibitor . Treating non - stop brains with MG132 rescued SCAR protein amounts to levels found in wild type brains ( Figure 4D ) . Together , these data show Non - stop counters polyubiquitination and entry of SCAR into the proteasomal degradation pathway . Non - stop regulates SCAR protein levels and localization To examine whether increasing Non - stop led to increased SCAR , we expressed recombinant Non - stop in BG3 cells and utilized indirect immunofluorescence to observe the amount and location of endogenous SCAR protein . Upon expression of Non - stop - FH in BG3 cells , endogenous SCAR pro - tein levels increased five - fold compared with mock transfected cells ( Figure 5A ) . Utilizing anti - HA Figure 3 continued interacting with Non - stop , immunoblotting signals were quantified by densitometry and the amount of SCAR interacting per given amount of Non - stop was calculated and expressed relative to WT control .

Increased SCAR protein co - compartmentalized with Non - stop , even within the nucleus , where SCAR function is more enigmatic ( Figure 5A ) . To quantify co - compartmentalization of SCAR and Non - stop , the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios of Non - stop - FH and endogenous SCAR were calcu - lated by dividing immunofluorescence intensity within each nucleus by that of the corresponding cytoplasm . This was plotted as the ratio nuclear : cytoplasmic SCAR on the Y axis and the ratio nuclear : cytoplasmic Non - stop on the X axis . As the amount of Non - stop in the nucleus increased , so did the amount of SCAR in the nucleus , showing Non - stop was driving SCAR localization ( R 2 = 0 . 8 ) ( Figure 5A ) . SCAR functions , within WRC , to activate Arp2 / 3 and facilitate branching of F - actin filaments ( Kurisu and Takenawa , 2009 ) . With correct spatiotemporal regulation of these actin - branching com - plexes , cells are able to establish appropriate shape and size through extension of actin - based pro - trusions ( Blanchoin et al . , 2014 ) . BG3 cells have a characteristic bimodal appearance when plated in the absence of concanavalin A ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) . If Non - stop overexpression were disrupting SCAR function through augmenting and mislocalizing SCAR , changes in cell shape and ability to form pro - trusions were predicted ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ) . Using phalloidin to observe F - actin in cells overexpressing Non - stop , a substantial change in cell morphology was observed . Cells displayed fewer projections and covered less total area ( Figure 5B ) . This was specific for cells expressing Non - stop in the cytoplasm or both nucleus and cytoplasm . Increased Non - stop signal associated closely with increased phalloidin signal . Overexpression of SCAR alone similarly led to reductions in cell area and number of projections observed ( Figure 5B ) . Non - stop bears multiple , conserved , WRC interacting receptor sequence ( WIRS ) motifs The basis for interaction between the SAGA DUBm , Arp2 / 3 , and WRC was sought . WRC subunits HEM , SRA - 1 , and Abi mediate interaction with an unidentified deubiquitinase to counteract protea - somal degradation of SCAR ( Kunda et al . , 2003 ) . WRC subunits Abi and SRA - 1 mediate interaction with WRC interacting receptor sequences ( WIRS ) - bearing proteins which contribute to spatiotempo - ral regulation of SCAR ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . Recall , Hem and Sra - 1 were present in mass spectrometry analysis of Group 2 proteins , suggesting Non - stop was in vicinity of this surface of WRC . Primary sequence analysis of DUBm subunits revealed four WIRS - conforming sequences on Non - stop and three on mammalian Non - stop orthologue USP22 . These were numbered from 0 to 3 , with WIRS1 and 3 conserved in location between Drosophila and mammalian Non - stop . ( Figure 6A ) . None of the other DUBm components bore conserved WIRS motifs . Although analysis of the yeast orthologue of Non - stop ( UBP8 ) did not reveal a WIRS - like motif , the Atxn7 orthologue Sgf73 did . In Figure 4 continued immunoblotted for SCAR . Immunoblots for Ada2b control for incorporation into the SAGA complex . Immunoblots for HA verify the presence of the Non - stop - FH constructs . Ada2b and SCAR intensity were quantified and normalized to HA . Values are shown as relative to WT . Error bars represent standard error . ( B ) Non - stop catalytic mutation which decreases substrate binding also decreases interaction with SCAR . The Non - stop catalytic cysteine was mutated to serine ( C406S ) . BG3 cells were mock transfected ( - ) , transfected with Non - stop - FH , or with Non - stop C406S - FH ( C406S ) and whole cell extracts were prepared . Flag resin was used to immunoprecipitate the Non - stop - FH constructs . Pull - downs were immunoblotted for SCAR . Incorporation into SAGA was verified by Ada2b immunoblot . HA immunoblots verify the presence of the Non - stop - FH constructs . Ada2b and SCAR intensity was quantified and normalized to HA . Values are shown as relative to wild type . Error bars are standard error . ( C ) Non - stop counters polyubiquitination of SCAR . BG3 cells were treated with dsRNA targeting either non - stop or LacZ and transfected with HA - ubiquitin ( HA - Ub ) and SCAR - FLAG ( SCAR - F ) . Control cells were treated with LacZ dsRNA and a mock transfection was performed . After six days , cells were treated with MG132 protease inhibitor for 6 hr and denaturing whole cell extracts were made . Anti - flag resin was used to capture SCAR - FLAG . Immunoblots were performed for ubiquitin ( VU - 1 ) and Flag to verify presence of SCAR . Protein intensity for VU - 1 was measured and normalized to Flag protein intensity .

WT or not brains were dissected from 3 rd instar larva and cultured ex vivo . Half of the brains from each genotype were treated for 24 hr with protease inhibitor [ 50 m m MG132 ( MG132 + ) ] while the remaining brains served as untreated control ( MG132 - ) . Whole cell extracts were immunoblotted for SCAR . SCAR protein intensity was measured and normalized to Ponceau total protein control . Numbers are expressed as relative to WT untreated control .

Overexpression of Non - stop increases SCAR levels , directs SCAR localization , and alters cell morphology – reducing cell area and number of cell protrusions . ( A ) Augmenting Non - stop increases local levels of SCAR . Drosophila BG3 central nervous system cells were transfected with no plasmid ( control ) or with Non - stop - FH expression vector as indicated . Exogenous Non - stop and endogenous SCAR were located and quantified through nuclear localization by DAPI ( DNA ) ( white ) and indirect immunofluorescence toward : Non - stop - FH ( anti - HA ) ( magenta ) , and anti - SCAR ( yellow ) .

DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 49677 12 of 35 Research article Cell Biology Neuroscience yeast , the DUBm can also be found separate from SAGA , although not without Sgf73 ( Lim et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , we focused on Non - stop WIRS motifs . To verify Non - stop WIRS motifs are important for Non - stop / SCAR interaction , putative WIRS motifs were inactivated using a phenylalanine to alanine substitution , previously demonstrated to be effective at inactivating these motifs ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . This mutant displayed an approximate 80 % reduction in SCAR binding , but still integrated into SAGA as observed by maintenance of Atxn7 binding ( Figure 6B ) . To determine whether Non - stop WIRS sequences are necessary for Non - stop - mediated modula - tion of SCAR function , a series of phenylalanine to alanine point mutants of individual WIRS domains ( WIRS F - A ) were generated and expressed in BG3 cells . As above ( Figure 5 ) , the ability of Non - stop WIRS mutants to increase the levels of endogenous SCAR protein , to change cell area , and to change the number of protrusions per cell was measured . Immunofluorescence was used to detect the HA epitope on exogenously expressed Non - stop and an antibody toward endogenous SCAR was used to observe SCAR protein levels . Cells expressing moderate amounts of Non - stop as judged by the spectrum of fluorescence intensity were analyzed to avoid assaying cells with either too little or too much exogenous Non - stop relative to endogenous protein . The ratio of HA fluores - cence to SCAR fluorescence in each mutant was calculated and compared to wild - type Non - stop ( Figure 6C ) . In each case , the Non - stop mutant produced less SCAR protein than wild type , suggest - ing that these motifs are indeed important for Non - stop mediated increases in SCAR protein levels ( Figure 6C ) . Mutant Non - stop was also less potent for decreasing cell area and decreasing the num - ber of cell protrusions ( Figure 6D ) . The effect of mutating each WIRS was not equivalent , suggesting a hierarchy for which is most important for WRC stabilization . In Drosophila , specific cell - type and subcellular location of actin branching enzymes facilitate fine tuning of actin remodeling in space and time ( Zallen et al . , 2002 ) . SCAR and the single Drosophila WASp homolog act non - redundantly to orchestrate actin branching in different tissues and to regu - late different developmental decisions . SCAR is particularly important in axon development in the central nervous system and adult eye morphology , but also essential for blastoderm organization and egg chamber structure during development . Within these tissues , cells display both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of SCAR ( Zallen et al . , 2002 ) . Considering the demonstrated importance of Atxn7 , Non - stop , and SCAR in the nervous system and eye , the interplay between these genes was examined in 3 rd instar larval brains . To observe an output of SCAR function , phalloidin was used to visualize F - actin . In Non - stop mutants , F - actin inten - sity was reduced by approximately 70 % ( Figure 7A ) . In Atxn7 mutants , F - actin levels increased approximately 1 . 7 times ( Figure 7B ) . To test for genetic interaction between the SAGA DUBm and SCAR , heterozygous mutations of Atxn7 and SCAR were combined and F - actin levels determined ( Figure 7C ) . In Atxn7 heterozygotes , F - actin levels were not significantly different than wild - type . In SCAR heterozygotes , however , F - actin levels were decreased . Combining Atxn7 and SCAR heterozy - gous mutants rescued F - actin levels . Together , these results support a model where Atxn7 restrains Non - stop from stabilizing and increasing levels of SCAR , which then increases F - actin . Figure 5 continued Scale bar is 10 m M . Hashed lines outline DAPI ( inner circle ) to approximate nuclear location and the outermost SCAR signal to approximate the cell edge ( outer circles ) . Three categories of HA ( Non - stop - FH ) expression are shown : Non - stop ‘nuclear’ , Non - stop ‘cytoplasmic’ , and Non - stop ‘nuclear and cytoplasmic . ’ Total SCAR signal was measured in HA positive cells ( Non - stop - FH ) and mock transfected cells ( Control ) . The average increase in endogenous SCAR immunofluorescence intensity was determined relative to control ( top , right panel ) . Error bars are standard error . To examine the relationship between Non - stop localization and increased SCAR protein , SCAR immunofluorescence intensity was measured in the nucleus ( as defined by DAPI ) and in the cytoplasm . A ratio of nuclear SCAR intensity divided by cytoplasmic SCAR intensity was calculated . HA intensity was similarly measured in the nucleus and cytoplasm . A ratio of nuclear HA intensity to cytoplasmic HA intensity was calculated . The HA ratio was plotted on the X axis and the SCAR ratio was plotted on the Y axis . A trend line was calculated and the R 2 was determined to be 0 . 80 . ( B ) Increasing Non - stop alters F - actin organization similarly to increasing SCAR – reducing cell area and number of cell protrusions . BG3 cells were transfected with no - plasmid ( Control ) , Non - stop - FH , or SCAR - FH . The location of exogenously expressed proteins were determined as above and F - actin was visualized using phalloidin . Cell area and total number of cellular projections were counted by quantifying the phalloidin signal distribution . HA - positive cells ( Non - stop - FH or SCAR - FH ) were compared to mock transfected ( Control ) cells ( bottom panels ) . Cells expressing Non - stop - FH were split into three categories of HA ( Non - stop - FH ) expression as above . T - tests were used to compare samples and p - values are shown .

Neu - ral - specific expression of Atxn7 RNAi ( Dietzl et al . , 2007 ) , driven by elav - Gal4 , results in defective axon targeting . Similarly , knockdown of either Non - stop ( Perkins et al . , 2015 ) or SCAR ( Perkins et al . , 2015 ) led to defective axon targeting . Gcn5 knock - down ( Dietzl et al . , 2007 ) , however , resulted in wild - type axon targeting . To test whether defective axon targeting upon Atxn7 loss , could be rescued by reducing SCAR ( Perkins et al . , 2015 ) , Atxn7 was knocked - down in a SCAR heterozygous background . Although there were fewer defects in axon targeting ( 62 % normal vs 52 % normal ) , this difference was not sufficient to achieve statistical significance ( p = 0 . 73 ) . Discussion Purification of Atxn7 - containing complexes indicated that Atxn7 functions predominantly as a mem - ber of SAGA ( Mohan et al . , 2014a ) . In yeast , the Atxn7 orthologue , Sgf73 , can be separated from SAGA along with the deubiquitinase module by the proteasome regulatory particle ( Lim et al . , 2013 ) . Without Sgf73 , the yeast deubiquitinase module is inactive ( Samara et al . , 2010 ) . In higher eukaryotes , Atxn7 increases , but is not necessary for Non - stop / USP22 enzymatic activity in vitro ( Mohan et al . , 2014a ; Lan et al . , 2015 ) . In Drosophila , loss of Atxn7 leads to a Non - stop over activ - ity phenotype , with reduced levels of ubiquitinated H2B observed ( Mohan et al . , 2014a ) . Here , puri - fication of Non - stop revealed the active SAGA DUBm associates with multi - protein complexes including WRC and Arp2 / 3 complexes separate from SAGA . SCAR was previously described to be regulated by a constant ubiquitination / deubiquitination mechanism ( Kunda et al . , 2003 ) . SCAR pro - tein levels increased upon knockdown of Atxn7 and decreased upon knockdown of non - stop . Decreases in SCAR protein levels in the absence of non - stop required a functional proteasome . Conversely , overexpression of Non - stop in cells led to increased SCAR protein levels and this increased SCAR protein colocalized to subcellular compartments where Non - stop was found . Nuclear Arp2 / 3 and WRC have been linked to nuclear reprogramming during early development , immune system function , and general regulation of gene expression ( Yoo et al . , 2007 ; Miyamoto et al . , 2013 ; Taylor et al . , 2010 ) . Distortions of nuclear shape alter chromatin domain location within the nucleus , resulting in changes in gene expression ( Navarro - Le´rida et al . , 2015 ; Rodriguez - Mesa et al . , 2012 ) . Nuclear pore stability is compromised in SAGA DUBm mutants , resulting in deficient mRNA export ( Ko¨hler et al . , 2008 ) . Similarly , mutants of F - actin regulatory pro - teins , such as Wash , show nuclear pore loss ( Verboon et al . , 2015 ) . Non - stop may contribute to nuclear pore stability and mRNA export through multiple mechanisms . When we examined the basis for this unexpected regulatory mechanism , we uncovered a series of WIRS motifs ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) conserved in number and distribution between flies and mam - mals . These sequences functionally modulate Non - stop ability to increase SCAR protein levels . Point mutants of each WIRS resulted in less SCAR protein per increase in Non - stop protein . WIRS mutant Non - stop retained the ability to incorporate into SAGA , indicating these are separation of function mutants . Figure 6 continued immunoprecipitated using anti - FLAG resin to capture exogenous Non - stop and immunoblotted for SCAR . Immunoblot for Atxn7 verified incorporation into the SAGA complex .

Arrows point to localized accumulation of Non - stop WIRS mutant protein , which coincide with aberrant actin protrusions commonly observed upon WRC or Arp2 / 3 loss of function .

In yeast , the proteasome regulatory particle removes the DUBm from SAGA ( Lim et al . , 2013 ) . In higher eukaryotes , caspase - 7 cleaves Atxn7 at residues which would be expected to release the DUBm , although this remains to be shown explicitly ( Young et al . , 2007 ) . The mechanisms orches - trating entry and exit of the DUBm from SAGA remain to be explored .

Proteins were digested using Endoproteinase Lys - C at 1 : 100 w / w ( Roche ) at 37˚C overnight . The samples were brought to a final concentration of 2 M urea and 2 mM CaCl 2 and a second digestion was performed overnight at 37˚ C using trypsin ( Roche ) at 1 : 100 w / w . The reactions were stopped using formic acid ( 5 % final ) . The digested size exclusion eluates were loaded on a split - triple - phase fused - silica micro - capillary col - umn and placed in - line with a linear ion trap mass spectrometer ( LTQ , Thermo Scientific ) , coupled with a Quaternary Agilent 1100 Series HPLC system . The digested Not and control FLAG - IP eluates were analyzed on an LTQ - Orbitrap ( Thermo ) coupled to an Eksigent NanoLC - 2D . In both cases , a fully automated 10 - step chromatography run was carried out . Each full MS scan ( 400 – 1600 m / z ) was followed by five data - dependent MS / MS scans . The number of the micro scans was set to one both for MS and MS / MS . The settings were as follows : repeat count 2 ; repeat duration 30 s ; exclusion list size 500 and exclusion duration 120 s , while the minimum signal threshold was set to 100 . Mass spectrometry data processing The MS / MS data set was searched using ProLuCID ( v . 1 . 3 . 3 ) against a database consisting of the long ( 703 amino acids ) isoform of non - stop , 22 , 006 non - redundant Drosphila melanogaster proteins ( merged and deduplicated entries from GenBank release 6 , FlyBase release 6 . 2 . 2 and NCI RefSeq release 88 ) , 225 usual contaminants , and , to estimate false discovery rates ( FDRs ) , 22 , 007 random - ized amino acid sequences derived from each NR protein entry . To account for alkylation by CAM , 57 Da were added statically to the cysteine residues . To account for the oxidation of methionine to methionine sulfoxide , 16 Da were added as a differential modification to the methionine residue . Peptide / spectrum matches were sorted and selected to an FDR less than 5 % at the peptide and pro - tein levels , using DTASelect in combination with swallow , an in - house software .
