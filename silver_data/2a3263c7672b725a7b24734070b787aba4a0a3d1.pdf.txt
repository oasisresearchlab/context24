Deusinglaan 1 , 9713 AV Groningen , The Netherlands Non - phagocytic eukaryotic cells can internalize particles < 1 µ m in size , encompassing pathogens , liposomes for drug delivery or lipoplexes applied in gene delivery . In the present study , we have investigated the effect of particle size on the pathway of entry and subsequent intracellular fate in non - phagocytic B16 cells , using a range of ﬂuorescent latex beads of deﬁned sizes ( 50 – 1000 nm ) . Our data reveal that particles as large as 500 nm were internalized by cells via an energy - dependent process . With an increase in size ( 50 – 500 nm ) , cholesterol depletion increased the efﬁciency of inhibition of uptake . The processing of the smaller particles was signiﬁcantly perturbed upon microtubule disruption , while displaying a negligible effect on that of the 500 nm beads . Inhibitor and co - localization studies revealed that the mechanism by which the beads were internalized , and their subsequent intra - cellular routing , was strongly dependent on particle size . Inter - nalization of microspheres with a diameter < 200 nm involved clathrin - coated pits . With increasing size , a shift to a mechanism that relied on caveolae - mediated internalization became apparent , which became the predominant pathway of entry for particles of 500 nm in size . At these conditions , delivery to the lysosomes was no longer apparent . The data indicate that the size itself of ( ligand - devoid ) particles can determine the pathway of entry . The clathrin - mediated pathway of endocytosis shows an upper size limit for internalization of approx . 200 nm , and kinetic parameters may determine the almost exclusive internalization of such particles along this pathway rather than via caveolae . Key words : caveolae , endocytosis , gene delivery , microsphere uptake , particle size . INTRODUCTION In recent years , cationic - lipid - mediated gene transfer has become a versatile tool for cellular transfection , relevant to fundamental cell biological research and gene therapy alike ( reviewed in [ 1 , 2 ] ) . However , the interaction between DNA and cationic lipids is difﬁ - cult to control , resulting in the formation of complexes ( ‘lipo - plexes’ ) that display a very heterogeneous size distribution . Often , the particle size ranges from 100 nm to > 1 µ m , and , evi - dently , the efﬁciency of cellular uptake and subsequent intracel - lular processing , a prerequisite for effective cellular transfection , may well depend on particle size . Although the molecular details of the mechanism by which cationic lipid carriers mediate DNA delivery are still poorly understood , current evidence supports the hypothesis that the cationic lipid – DNA complexes enter cells by means of endocytosis . Subsequently , a ‘perturbation’ of the endosomal membrane occurs , causing release of the complex - associated plasmid into the cytosol , eventually leading towards nuclear integration of the gene [ 3 – 8 ] . Yet , a number of different endocytic pathways can be distinguished , utilized by eukaryotic cells to internalize a large variety of substances , and which might affect the kinetics of intracellular complex processing and thereby transfection efﬁciency itself . These pathways include phagocytosis , macropinocytosis , clathrin - mediated endocytosis and non - clathrin - mediated endocytosis , the latter including inter - nalization via caveolae . It is believed that such a diverse range of mechanisms is used by cells to accomplish different tasks . In previous work , we demonstrated that cationic lipid – DNA complexes primarily transfect cells , following complex inter - nalization via the pathway of clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 9 ] .

However , in this previous work , it could not be excluded that a minor fraction entered cells via caveolae . Caveolae are invagi - nated , ﬂask - shaped plasma membrane domains , which are es - pecially enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids . They are characterized by the presence of the integral membrane protein caveolin . Interestingly , caveolae can internalize large molecular complexes , such as cholera toxin [ 10 ] , and may serve as a portal of entry for certain viruses such as SV40 ( simian virus 40 ) [ 11 , 12 ] and bacteria [ 13 ] . In fact , in this manner , bacteria ( or viruses ) might escape delivery to and digestion in lysosomes [ 13 ] . Analogously , by avoiding lysosomal targeting , as occurs along the pathway of receptor - mediated endocytosis , such a pathway could thus be advantageous in carrier - mediated drug and DNA delivery . Moreover , another previous study [ 8 ] hinted that size might be an important parameter in the pathway of particle entry . The purpose of the present study was therefore to investigate the effect of particle size on the pathway of entry and processing by cells . How - ever , since it is virtually impossible to produce homogeneous populations of lipoplexes of well - deﬁned sizes , we systematically studied the uptake of ﬂuorescent latex particles of deﬁned sizes by non - phagocytic mouse melanoma B16 cells . In this manner , insight was obtained into the size - dependent regulation of particle internalization via an endocytic mechanism . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture The murine melanoma cell line B16 - F10 was cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium containing 10 % ( v / v ) c (cid:2) 2004 Biochemical Society 160 J . Rejman and others foetal calf serum and 100 µ g / ml penicillin / streptomycin ( Gibco BRL , Life Technology , Merelbeke , Begium ) with 5 % CO 2 at 37 ◦ C . Fluorescent microspheres Fluorescent microspheres Fluoresbrite ® YG ( yellow – green ; λ ex , 445 nm ; λ em , 500 nm ) and Fluoresbrite ® YO ( yellow – orange ; λ ex , 535 nm ; λ em , 570 nm ) were purchased from Polysciences ( Warrington , PA , U . S . A . ) . Their sizes were 50 , 100 , 200 , 500 and 1000 nm in diameter . The microspheres were incubated with B16 cells in serum - free medium . Removal of attached beads was accomplished by washing the cells three times ( 10 min ) with 0 . 2 M ethanoic acid / 0 . 5 M NaCl . In addition , cells were washed with a 0 . 4 % ( w / v ) Trypan Blue solution [ 9 , 14 ] to quench extracellular ﬂuorescence , thus enabling determination of the fraction that was actually inter - nalized . FACS analysis A Coulter Elite ﬂow cytometer was used to perform FACS ana - lysis . After incubation with microspheres , the cells were washed three times and detached by trypsinization . After centrifugation , the cells were resuspended in a 0 . 4 % ( w / v ) Trypan Blue solution inHanksbalancedsaltsolution ( HBSS ) toquenchtheextracellular ﬂuorescence . The treated samples were subsequently washed twice , and analysed by ﬂow cytometry , with 5000 – 10000 cells measured in each sample . Cholesterol depletion Cholesterol depletion was carried out essentially as described previously [ 9 ] , with 10 mM methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ) [ 15 – 17 ] , in the presence of 1 µ g / ml lovastatin ( Sigma ) for 1 h at 37 ◦ C . Cytoskeletal disruption The cells were pre - incubated with 10 µ g / ml nocodazole ( Sigma ) for 60 min at 37 ◦ C to disrupt microtubuli . Consecutively , micro - spheres of 50 , 100 , 200 or 500 nm in diameter were added and incubated in serum - free cell - culture medium in the presence of the drug . Potassium depletion B16 cells were washed once with potassium - free buffer , pH 7 . 4 , containing 140 mM NaCl , 20 mM Hepes , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mg / ml D - glucose , followed by a wash with hypotonic buffer ( potassium - free buffer diluted with water , 1 : 1 ) . Then , the cells were washed again three times with potassium - free buffer . Controlcellsweretreatedwithbuffer , pH 7 . 4 , containing140 mM NaCl , 20 mM Hepes , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mg / ml D - glucose and 10 mM KCl . Microspheres of different sizes were incubated with the cells in potassium - free or potassium - contain - ing buffer , as indicated . Subsequently , the cells were analysed by FACS . Treatment with other drugs / inhibitors B16 cells were treated with genistein ( 200 µ M ) [ 18 , 19 ] , ﬁlipin ( 5 µ g / ml ) [ 20 , 21 ] , chlorpromazine ( 10 µ g / ml ) [ 22 ] or 5 - ( N , N - dimethyl ) amiloridehydrochloride ( 10 µ M ) [ 23 ] ( allfromSigma ) , in serum - free culture medium for 1 h , at 37 ◦ C . Subse - quently , ﬂuorescent latex beads were added and the incubation was continued for another 2 h , after which the cells were analysed by FACS . Expression of Eps15 ( epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate clone 15 ) mutants In the present study , we employed two GFP ( green ﬂuorescent protein ) – Eps15 constructs ( gifts from Dr Alexandre Benmerah and Dr Alice Dautry - Varsat , Pasteur Institute , Paris , France ) , Eps15 ( DIII ) , and a mutant form deprived of AP - 2 ( adaptor pro - tein - 2 ) - binding sites ( D3 (cid:3) 2 ) . B16 cells were transfected with the GFP – DIII and GFP – D3 (cid:3) 2 constructs using SAINT2 ( N - methyl - 4 ( dioleyl ) methylpyridinium chloride ) / DOPE ( dioleoylphos - phatidylethanolamine ) as the carrier system , as previously des - cribed [ 9 ] . At 2 days after transfection , the cells were incubated with differently sized beads in serum - free medium for 3 h at 37 ◦ C . After intense washing , cells were treated with Trypan Blue , washed three times in HBSS and examined by confocal microscopy ( Leica TCS SP2 ; Germany ) : λ ex , 488 nm and λ em , 530 nm for GFP ; λ ex , 535 nm and λ em , 570 nm for red beads . Co - localization of beads with BODIPY ® ( 4 , 4 - diﬂuoro - 4 - bora - 3a , 4a - diaza - s - indacene ) – LacCer ( lactosylceramide ) or caveolin For BODIPY ® – LacCer co - localization studies , cells were incu - batedwiththelipidanalogue ( 1 µ M ) inthepresenceofﬂuorescent microspheres for 30 min at 10 ◦ C . The lag time between adding the beads and the lipid was 5 min . After 90 min of incubation at 37 ◦ C , the medium was removed and the cells were washed once in HBSS after which they were treated with Trypan Blue , as described above , and analysed by confocal microscopy ( Leica TCS SP2 ) . For co - localization of the beads with caveolin , the B16 cells were washed three times with serum - free medium and then were incubated with ﬂuorescent latex beads for 30 min at 4 ◦ C to promote their interaction with the plasma membrane . To trigger internalization , the cells were subsequently incubated at 37 ◦ C for 30 min , after which time interval they were ﬁxed for 30 min in 4 % ( w / v ) paraformaldehyde . The cells were permeabilized with 0 . 2 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 and non - speciﬁc sites were blocked with PBS containing 1 % ( w / v ) BSA and 0 . 2 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 . Subsequently , the cells were incubated with the primary antibody against caveolin 1 ( rabbit pAb ; Transduction Laboratories Pharmingen , Alphen a / d Rijn , The Netherlands ) diluted 1 : 100 , for 16 h at 4 ◦ C . After washing with PBS , the primary antibody was coupled with FITC - labelled anti - rabbit IgG antibody at a dilution of 1 : 75 for 45 min at room temperature ( 20 ◦ C ) . For microscopy , the cells were embedded in mounting medium from DAKO ( Carpinteria , CA , U . S . A . ) . The cells were examined by confocal scanning microscopy as above . Lysosome staining LysoTracker Red B16 cells were ﬁrst incubated with ﬂuorescent microspheres ( green ) for 2 h ( 37 ◦ C , serum - free medium ) . After extensive washing , the lysosomal marker , LysoTracker Red ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR , U . S . A . ) , was applied ( 50 pM at 37 ◦ C for 1 h ) . Subsequently , the cells were washed and treated with extra - cellular quencher [ 0 . 4 % ( w / v ) Trypan Blue ] . c (cid:2) 2004 Biochemical Society Particle size affects the mechanism of uptake 161 Figure 1 Size - dependent internalization of ﬂuorescently labelled microspheres The cells were incubated at 37 ◦ C with ﬂuorescently labelled microspheres of 50 ( for 1 h ) ( A ) , 200 ( 3 h ) ( B ) or 500 ( 3 h ) ( C ) nm in diameter and then washed three times for 10 min with 0 . 2 M ethanoic acid / 0 . 5 M NaCl solution to remove surface - boundbeads . Alternatively , to ascertain visualization of the internalized fraction only , thecells were treated with the ﬂuorescence - quenchingdye Trypan Blue ( 0 . 4 % ) , as described in the Materials and methods section . The samples were subsequently examined by confocal microscopy ( Leica TCS SP2 ) . The insets represent corresponding phase - contrast images . FITC – dextran Alternatively , B16 cells were ﬁrst incubated with FITC – dextran ( green ) for 12 h at 37 ◦ C to allow the dye to accumulate in the endo / lysosomal compartments . The cells were incubated with ﬂuorescent microspheres ( red ) in serum - free medium for 4 h at 37 ◦ C . After washing and quenching the cell - associated particles , samples were studied by means of confocal microscopy ( Leica TCS SP2 ) . RESULTS Efﬁciency of uptake of beads is dependent on size To determine the effect of particle size on the pathway of inter - nalization by non - phagocytic cells , ﬂuorescently labelled micro - spheres of 50 , 100 , 200 , 500 and 1000 nm in diameter were incubated with mouse melanoma B16 cells . Evidence of uptake was obtained by confocal microscopy and FACS . To discriminate between cell - association and actual internalization , extracellular ﬂuorescence was quenched by addition of Trypan Blue , the non - quenched fraction thus representing internalized beads [ 14 ] . The data revealed that the cells took up particles up to a size of 500 nm at 37 ◦ C ( Figure 1 ) , i . e . no uptake was seen of particles 1 µ m in size . From quantitative data obtained by FACS , we estimate that , relative to internalized 50 nm beads , the uptake of the 100 nm beads was diminished by approx . 3 – 4 - fold , whereas the internalization of the 200 and 500 nm beads was reduced by approx . 8 – 10 times . Internalization of beads with diameters of 50 and 100 nm started immediately at 37 ◦ C after initial binding at 4 ◦ C ( Figure 2 ) , and continued for approx . 3 h . Over a time interval of 30 min , some 50 % of the cell - associated beads were internalized , as determined by Trypan Blue quenching ( see above ) . In contrast , little , if any , uptake of 500 nm beads was seen over a period of 30 min , and signiﬁcant accumulation within the cells could be only detected after 2 – 3 h . Examination of the cells by ﬂuorescence microscopy revealed further that the internalized beads of 50 , 100 and 200 nm were distributed throughout the cells ( Figures 1A , 1B and 2 ) . Following a subsequent chase , the particles accumulated in the perinuclear region of the cells . In contrast , 500 nm beads were localized largely at the periphery of the cells ( Figure 1C ) , irrespective of the incubation time or that of the subsequent chase ( results not shown ; cf . Figure 1C ) . No internalization of the beads was seen at 4 ◦ C . c (cid:2) 2004 Biochemical Society 162 J . Rejman and others Figure 2 Internalization of ﬂuorescently labelled 50 nm microspheres Microspheres of 50 nm were ﬁrst incubated with the cells at 4 ◦ C , to allow binding ( 30 min ) . The unbound beads were removed by extensively washing the cells with ice - cold HBSS buffer ( ﬁve times ) . Internalization , followingwarmingup , wasexaminedbyconfocalmicroscopy ( LeicaTCSSP2 ) . Pictureswereobtainedatdifferenttimepoints : 0 ( A ) , 5 ( B ) and20 ( C ) min . Diffusecell - surface staining was gradually replaced with a distinct intracellular localization of the beads , which eventually accumulated near the perinuclear region of the cell . Figure 3 Microtubule disruption perturbs the intracellular processing of internalized beads The cells were incubated with nocodazole ( 10 µ g / ml ) for 60 min at 37 ◦ C , before addition of the beads . Subsequently , microspheres were added to the solution and incubated for 2 h at 37 ◦ C . The cells were then acid - washed and / or treated with Trypan Blue to remove and / or quench extracellular ﬂuorescence respectively . The samples were examined by confocal microscope ( Leica TCS SP2 ) . Note that incubation of the cells with nocodazole caused the accumulation of 50 ( A ) and 200 ( B ) nm particles just beneath the plasma membrane . Microtubule disruption affects particle internalization and processing in a size - dependent manner Although quantitative differences in particle internalization were observed ( see above ) , those with a diameter up to 200 nm were re - latively rapidly processed , and accumulated in the perinuclear region of the cell ( see Figure 1B ; cf . Figure 2 for 50 nm beads ) . This process was microtubule - dependent . Thus pre - incubation of the cells with nocodazole caused the accumulation of 50 , 100 and 200 nm particles near the plasma membrane ( Figure 3 ) . Presumably , disruption of the microtubules precluded intracel - lular trafﬁcking of these beads from early to late endosomes . A quantitative analysis of the internalized fractions by FACS following this treatment revealed further that , apart from intra - cellular processing , the effective internalization was also modu - lated . The amount of internalized 50 and 100 nm microspheres was reduced by > 50 % in nocodazole - treated cells . Interestingly , theuptakeof200 nmbeadswasdiminishedbyonly25 % , whereas boththeinternalizationandintracellulardistributionofthe500 nm particles remained unchanged . Accordingly , these data suggest that , in a size - dependent manner , differences exist in the potential control and mechanism of internalization , a point of inﬂection becoming apparent at a size of approx . 200 nm . Internalization of the beads is diminished by cholesterol depletion In recent years , it has been well - established that different types of endocytosis can operate simultaneously and that some of those are susceptible to cholesterol depletion [ 9 , 15 – 17 , 24 , 25 ] . It was therefore of interest to examine whether size - dependent distinc - tions in internalization could be revealed as a function of chol - esterol depletion . To this end , the cells were pre - treated with M β CD and were incubated in the presence of lovastatin , an inhib - itor of de novo synthesis of cholesterol [ 9 , 17 ] . As shown in Figure 4 , the internalization of the beads was affected by cholesterol depletion , showing a tendency towards decreased internalization c (cid:2) 2004 Biochemical Society Particle size affects the mechanism of uptake 163 Figure 4 Differential effect of cholesterol depletion on the internalization of microspheres The cells were pre - incubated with 10 mM M β CD for 1 h at 37 ◦ C . Lovastatin ( 1 µ g / mg ) was present during both cholesterol depletion and the subsequent incubation . Beads of 50 , 100 , 200 or 500 nm were added and the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 ◦ C . Evidence of uptake was obtained by FACS . The ﬂuorescence intensity of beads in control cells was set at 100 % . Irrespective of size , the uptake of the microspheres was reduced , suggesting that efﬁcient internalization requires cholesterol . However , uptake of the 500 nm microspheres was affected most prominently . For each size of microsphere , three independent experiments were carried out in duplicate . with increased particle size , the uptake of the 500 nm particles becoming inhibited by > 90 % . Both caveolae - [ 20 , 21 , 26 – 28 ] and clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 9 , 17 , 29 ] have been shown to depend on cholesterol . However , recent evidence also suggests a role for cholesterol in macropinocytosis [ 25 ] , although such a mechanism is likely to be of less relevance in non - professional endocytosing cells , such as B16 cells . Yet , interestingly , the data in Figure 4 reveal different susceptibilities , in particular when comparing the 200 nm beads with the 500 nm beads , implying distinct cholesterol - dependent internalization mechanisms . To discriminate further between these mechanisms , the following experiments were carried out . The mechanism of bead internalization is size - dependent ; clathrin versus caveolin coats Transferrin is generally accepted as a ligand exclusively internal - ized via the clathrin - coated - pit pathway . Therefore we employed FITC – transferrin as a model compound to adjust concentrations of inhibitors utilized for blocking this pathway of endocytosis . Internalization of ﬂuorescent microspheres was studied at con - centrations , which entirely inhibited the uptake of transferrin . Previously , we have shown that depletion of intracellular potas - sium inhibits clathrin - mediated endocytosis of a ( heterogeneous ) mixture of lipoplexes ( mean diameter of approx . 200 nm ) [ 9 ] . To examine whether or not the ensuing inhibition of transfection efﬁciency , as observed , resulted from an inhibition of the internal - ization of a deﬁned population , we next examined the extent to which microsphere uptake was inhibited as a function of size . We adopted a procedure in which cells were ﬁrst subjected to hypo - tonic shock and then transferred to isotonic potassium - free buffer , resulting in rapid depletion of cellular potassium [ 30 ] . Figure 5 shows that , in potassium - depleted cells , the uptake of micro - spheres decreases with decreasing diameter , the 50 nm beads showing the highest degree of inhibition ( approx . 70 % ) , whereas internalization of the 500 nm beads was barely affected ( 15 % ) . A similar pattern of inhibition as a function of diameter was observed for microsphere uptake by cells pre - treated with chlor - promazine , which perturbs clathrin - processing and thereby clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 22 ] . In this case , the inhibition of Figure 5 Effect of inhibitors of clathrin - mediated endocytosis on the internalization of microspheres B16 cells were ﬁrst washed with potassium - free buffer , pH 7 . 4 , consisting of 140 mM NaCl , 20 mM Hepes , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mg / ml D - glucose . It was followed by rinsing withhypotonicbuffer ( potassium - freebufferdilutedwithwater , 1 : 1 ) . Thecellswerethenwashed again three times with potassium - free buffer . Control cells were treated with buffer , pH 7 . 4 , composed of 140 mM NaCl , 20 mM Hepes , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mg / ml D - glucose and10 mMKCl . Microspheresofdifferentsizeswereincubatedwiththecellsinpotassium - free or potassium - containing buffer for 60 min at 37 ◦ C . Alternatively , B16 cells were pre - treated with chlorpromazine ( 10 µ g / ml ) in serum - free cell - culture medium for 1 h , at 37 ◦ C . After this period , ﬂuorescentlatex beads wereaddedand incubatedfor 2 h . For each size of microsphere , three separate experiments were carried out in duplicate . internalization of microspheres with sizes between 200 and 50 nm progressively decreased from 70 to 30 % , whereas the uptake of those with a diameter of 500 nm was unaltered or even slightly higher ( Figure 5 ) . To obtain further support for the observations that apparently the smaller beads are preferentially internalized via the pathway of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , we overexpressed dominant - negative constructs of Eps15 , which have been shown to inhibit clathrin - dependent endocytosis [ 31 , 32 ] . In the present study , we employed two Eps15 constructs generated by Benmerah et al . [ 31 ] in which GFP was fused to the entire C - terminal domain of Eps15 ( DIII overexpression of which highly inhibited transferrin endocytosis ) or a mutant form ( D3 (cid:3) 2 ) deprived of all AP - 2 binding sites ( overexpression of which did not change uptake of transferrin ) . Thus B16 cells were transfected with GFP – DIII and GFP – D3 (cid:3) 2 constructs using SAINT2 / DOPE as a plasmid carrier system , as described previously [ 9 ] . The cells were subsequently incubated with the ﬂuorescent microspheres . Overexpression of the entire C - terminal domain ( DIII ) inhibited the internalization of 200 nm beads ( Figure 6B ) . The lack of AP - 2 - binding sites in the construct restored the internalization of 200 nm particles ( Fig - ure 6D ) . These data are consistent with the inhibition observed upon chlorpromazine treatment ( Figure 5 ) , suggesting a depen - dence of clathrin - coat mediated uptake . In contrast , as shown in Figures 6 ( A ) and 6 ( C ) , the internalization of the 500 nm particles was equally effective in the cells transfected with two different constructs and non - transfected cells , implying that their entry into the cell is insensitive to the changes in the organization of the clathrin - coated pits . Since B16 cells are non - phagocytic cells , a signiﬁcant contri - bution of macropinocytosis to the internalization of the large beads at non - stimulating conditions , was considered less likely . Indeed , several pieces of evidence argued against such a con - tribution . When cells had been pre - treated with the macropino - cytosis inhibitor 5 - ( N , N - dimethyl ) amiloride hydrochloride ( see the Materials and methods section ) or cytochalasin D , the level of internalization of the 500 nm beads was essentially indistin - guishable from that observed for non - treated cells , determined c (cid:2) 2004 Biochemical Society 164 J .

Subsequently , ﬂuorescent latex beads were added and incubated for the subsequent 2 h in the presence of inhibitors . Evidence of uptake was obtained by FACS . The ﬂuorescence intensity of beads in control cells was set as 100 % . Note that the inhibitors only affected the internalization of the 500 nm beads , i . e . leaving internalization of (cid:1) 200 nm microspheres unaltered . Results are means + − S . D . from three independent experiments , carried out in duplicate . as described above . Moreover , following addition of 500 nm beads , membrane rufﬂing of diIC 18 ( 1 , 1 (cid:1) - dioctadecyl - 3 , 3 , 3 (cid:1) , 3 (cid:1) - tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate ) - labelled plasma mem - branes was never observed ( results not shown ; see Discussion ) . Therefore , we next investigated whether or not these larger particles could be internalized along the pathway of caveolae - mediated endocytosis . The sphingolipid LacCer is internalized almost exclusively via a caveolae - mediated pathway [ 9 , 33 ] . This lipid marker was therefore employed to verify the effectiveness of a variety of potential inhibitors of this pathway in B16 cells , caveolae being also present at the surface of these cells [ 34 ] . Thus inhibitors , as indicated below , used at concentrations that completely inhibited the internalization of BODIPY ® - labelled LacCer , were subsequently employed to examine the ability of such an inhibitor to block internalization of the beads as well . Filipin has been reported to speciﬁcally block caveolae - mediated uptake [ 20 , 21 ] . When B16 cells had been treated with this compound ( 1 mg / ml ) for 60 min before incubation with mi - crospheres of different sizes , no signiﬁcant effect was observed on the uptake of the beads with a diameter (cid:1) 100 nm ( Figure 7 ) . However , while the uptake of the 200 nm beads was reduced by approx . 20 % , the uptake of the 500 nm particles was reduced by more than 50 % . Genistein inhibits caveolae - mediated uptake of SV40 [ 35 ] . Pre - treatment of the B16 cells with this drug at a concentration that completely inhibited the uptake of BODIPY ® – LacCer re - duced the uptake of 500 nm microspheres by more than 50 % , whereas the internalization of particles < 200 nm was relatively unaffected or even slightly enhanced ( Figure 7 ) . In line with this observation , as shown in Figure 8 ( A ) , a high degree of co - localization of internalized BODIPY ® – LacCer and the 500 nm beads was observed , which is consistent with the notion that inter - nalization of the 500 nm microspheres occurs via a caveolae - mediated mechanism . In contrast , as shown in Figure 8 ( B ) , there was hardly any co - localization observed for internalized BODIPY ® – LacCer and the 200 nm beads , emphasizing the size - dependent differences in the mechanism of uptake . Further support for a caveolae - mediated pathway of entry of the large 500 nm beads was obtained when investigating the poten - tial co - localization of caveolin , using FITC - labelled antibodies , and the ﬂuorescent 500 nm spheres . The merged confocal micro - graphs reveal yellow dots , which indicate co - localization of label - led caveolin and the 500 nm beads ( Figure 9 ) . No signiﬁcant co - localization for the smaller beads was seen ( results not shown ) , the appearance being fully in line with the distinct localization of LacCer and the 200 nm beads , as seen in Figure 8 ( B ) . Taken together , these data fully agree with the notion that caveolae are prominently and preferentially involved in the internalization of larger latex particles , i . e . with diameters exceeding 200 nm , but less than 1 µ m . Hence these data are consistent with a size - dependent internalization of beads via clathrin - and caveolae - mediated pathways . Beads of 200 nm , but not of 500 nm , arrive in late endosomal / lysosomal compartments As well as a distinction in the mechanism of internalization , the fate of the particles also appears to be size - dependent , the data suggesting that the smaller beads are able to reach late endosomal / lysosomal compartments after incubation for 4 h at 37 ◦ C . To verify this experimentally , B16 cells were ﬁrst incubated with FITC – dextran ( Figure 10 ) for 12 h , which was followed by an incubation with ﬂuorescent microspheres for 4 h . Co - localization was observed for dextran and microspheres (cid:1) 200 nm ( Fig - ure 10B ) , but not for 500 nm beads ( Figure 10A ) . These results were conﬁrmed by employing LysoTracker Red ( results not shown ) . DISCUSSION Given the heterogeneity of cationic lipid – DNA complexes , it has been difﬁcult to deﬁne precisely the effect of lipoplex size on transfection and at what level ( s ) in the overall transfection process size might be relevant . This prompted us to investigate the internalization of ﬂuorescent latex particles of deﬁned size by a non - phagocytic cell line , the B16 melanoma . In the present study , we have shown that particle size as such can strongly affect the efﬁciency of cellular uptake , the mode of endocytosis and the subsequent efﬁciency of particle processing along the endocytic pathway . This insight is of relevance in the context of both fundamental work , e . g . that aimed at deﬁning internalization pathways of micro - organisms , and applied studies , such as in carrier - mediated delivery of drugs . Previous studies demonstrated that epithelial cells can internalize microspheres of < 100 nm in diameter [ 36 , 37 ] . In the present paper , we demonstrate that microspheres as large as 500 nm are also internalized by non - phagocytic cells . Microspheres with diameters less than 200 nm , and approx . 80 % of the 200 nm beads as such , are internalized via clathrin - coated pits . The 500 nm beads enter the cells by a clathrin - independent pathway , the lower size limit of this pathway becoming gradually apparent at approx . 200 nm , whereas the upper limit is below 1 µ m , as these particles are not internalized by the non - phagocytic B16 cells . Internalization of the 500 nm microspheres , but not that of the smaller ones ( Figure 7 ) , was pro - minently inhibited by pre - treatment of the cells with ﬁlipin and genistein , both interfering with caveolae - mediated endocytosis [ 20 , 22 , 35 ] , whereas the 500 nm beads , and not the smaller ones , co - localized with the caveolae marker LacCer [ 33 ] ( Fig - ure 8 ) . Moreover , the data revealing a co - localization of the 500 nm beads and caveolin fully support these observations ( Figure 9 ) . In contrast , chlorpromazine , potassium depletion and overexpression of dominant - negative constructs of Eps15 did not affect internalization of the 500 nm beads , but progressively inhibited uptake of particles (cid:1) 200 nm . Accordingly , the data strongly suggest that larger particles ( at least 200 nm , but less than c (cid:2) 2004 Biochemical Society 166 J . Rejman and others A B Figure 8 Selective co - localization of internalized BODIPY R (cid:1) – LacCer and microspheres of distinct size Cells were incubated with BODIPY ® – LacCer ( 1 µ M ) in the presence of ﬂuorescent microspheres for 30 min at 10 ◦ C . The lag time between adding the beads and the lipid was 5 min . A 90 min incubation at 37 ◦ C was followed by removal of medium and washing in HBSS . After treatment with Trypan Blue , the cells were examined by confocal microscopy ( Leica TCS SP2 ) . The merged picture revealed numerous yellow dots indicating the co - localization of the internalized 500 nm beads and LacCer ( A ) . In contrast , such a co - localization was not apparent for BODIPY ® – LacCer and the 200 nm beads ( B ) .

Those with a diameter of 200 nm or less are processed along the pathway of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , entirely consistent with previous results that lipoplexes with an mean size of 200 nm are primarily inter - nalized along the same pathway [ 9 ] . Internalization of particles with diameters of 50 and 100 nm is a relatively rapid process , showing kinetics reminiscent of c (cid:2) 2004 Biochemical Society Particle size affects the mechanism of uptake 167 Figure 9 Internalized 500 nm beads co - localize with caveolin - 1 B16 cellswereincubatedwith500 nmdiameterﬂuorescentlatexbeadsfor30 minat4 ◦ C , whichwasfollowedbyinternalizationfor30 minat37 ◦ C .

Note that the beads localized near the cell periphery are red , whereas those that are in the process of internalization are yellow , reﬂecting a co - localization of internalized beads and caveolin . See the text for further details . receptor - mediated internalization of ligands , such as transferrin via coated vesicles . Thus half of the cell - associated fraction of 50 – 100 nm beads was internalized within 30 min ( Figure 2 ) . In contrast , even though 200 nm beads were shown to be internalized via a clathrin - mediated mechanism , their cellular processing was substantially slower , signiﬁcant internalization becoming apparent only after several hours . Similar ( low ) rates of cellular processing have been demonstrated earlier for clathrin - mediated uptake of lipoplexes with an mean diameter of 200 nm [ 9 ] . Such a size - dependent delay of uptake has also been reported for viral particles [ 38 ] and polyplexes [ 39 ] . Sinceourdatademonstratethatefﬁcientuptakeofmicrospheres requires cholesterol , we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that macropinocytosis is , to some extent , involved in the internal - ization of larger particles ( > 200 nm ) . This mode of particle inter - nalization , although not ubiquitous , may operate in cells other than macrophages and , as reported recently , is also dependent on the presence of cholesterol in the plasma membrane [ 25 ] . However , in light of the speciﬁcity of the applied inhibitors and given the co - localization studies , our data at best suggest a minor contribution of such a pathway in the present system . Moreover , it is well established that macropinocytosis requires a functional actin cytoskeleton [ 25 , 40 – 42 ] , whereas the internalization of the 500 nm beads is insensitive to cytochalasin D ( results not shown ) , which is known to block macropinocytosis [ 43 ] . Moreover , mem - brane rufﬂing , representing a prerequisite for formation of macro - pinosomes [ 25 ] , was never observed under these conditions , as visualized by labelling the plasma membrane with the ﬂuorescent lipid dye diIC 18 ( results not shown ) . Interestingly , even after 4 h at 37 ◦ C , the larger particles , in contrast with those with diameters of (cid:1) 200 nm , had not ( yet ) reached the lysosomal compartment . In fact , these observations may also shed some light on the question why larger lipoplexes might give rise to higher transfection efﬁciency [ 8 , 9 , 44 – 46 ] . Al - though the net internalization might be less , as compared with the smaller particles , actual gene release into the cytosol may well be higher , due to the prolonged residence time of the complexes in this compartment , thus avoiding rapid lysosomal degradation . Such an explanation is in agreement with reports that several pathogens , including viruses , bacteria and other parasites enter cells via caveolae , thereby escaping degradation in the lysosomal compartment [ 13 ] , possibly due to deprivation of the proper signals required for fusion with other cellular compartments [ 47 ] . Evidently , the actual size of single ﬂask - shape caveolae is too small for accommodating particles as large as 500 nm . In addition , the beads are obviously also devoid of speciﬁc ligands present on viral particles or bacteria , which can be bound and processed via caveolae - localized receptors [ 13 ] . Moreover , why are the smaller particles excluded from this internalization pathway ? Although a clear explanation is lacking , it can be speculated that electrostatic interactions localize the particles to either clathrin or caveolin - coated domains when they surf across the membrane surface . Evidently , following association with caveolae and given their size , recruitment of an internalization machinery is needed to accommodate particles that extend beyond the actual size of a caveolae domain , which appears possible given internalization of bacteria and viruses along this pathway . A preferential inter - nalization of the larger particles may then be related to a more strict dependence of clathrin - mediated internalization on particle size , i . e . displaying an upper limit of around 200 nm and a more rapid kinetics of internalization , the latter rationalizing why signiﬁcant entry of smaller particles ( (cid:1) 200 nm ) is not apparent via a caveolae - mediated pathway . Consistent with this notion , 100 nm particles never co - localized with 500 nm beads in co - incubation experiments ( results not shown ) . Moreover , over a c (cid:2) 2004 Biochemical Society 168 J .

Also , given the 200 nm size limit for the clathrin - mediated pathway of internalization , it would then be anticipated that kinetically both processes of internalization may start to compete when the size exceeds this diameter . This is indeed the case . In conclusion , the present study reveals the relevance of parti - cle size itself , i . e . devoid of ligands , as an important factor in governing the cellular pathway of entry and processing , relevant c (cid:2) 2004 Biochemical Society Particle size affects the mechanism of uptake 169 to various recent observations of pathogen entry . In addition , the work may prove useful for the rational design of carriers for drug and gene delivery , the efﬁciency of which depends on the mode of entry and efﬁciency of trafﬁcking to the lysosomes . Be - fore reaching this ultimate destination , an early release of the cargo is desirable in order to avoid degradation . Here , a rationale is provided as to why particle size may represent an important parameter in such a programmable mechanism of delivery .
