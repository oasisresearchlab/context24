It is usually simpler to compare two objects at a time , furthermore , some relations ( e . g . , the outcome of sports matches ) are naturally known for pairs . This paper investigates and compares pairwise comparison models and the stochastic Bradley - Terry model . It is proved that they provide the same priority vectors for consistent ( complete or incomplete ) comparisons . For incomplete comparisons , all ﬁlling in levels are considered . Recent results identiﬁed the optimal subsets and sequences of multiplicative / additive / reciprocal pairwise comparisons for small sizes of items ( up to n = 6 ) . Simulations of this paper show that the same subsets and sequences are optimal in case of the Bradley - Terry and the Thurstone models as well . This , somehow surprising , coincidence suggests the existence of a more general result . Further models of information and preference theory are subject to future investigation in order to identify optimal subsets of input data .

O C ] 7 O c t 2022 1 Introduction Comparison in pairs is a frequently used method in ranking and rating objects when scaling is diﬃcult due to its subjective nature . From a methodological point of view , two main types of models can be distinguished : the ones based on pairwise comparison matrices ( PCMs ) and the stochastic models motivated by Thurstone . The aim of this paper is to present some linkages between these approaches . We establish a direct relation between them via the concept of consistency . Evaluating consistent data , we mainly focus on the similarities of the results in the case of incomplete comparisons . In ( Bozóki and Szádoczki , 2022 ) and ( Szádoczki et al . , 2022 ) , the authors investigate incomplete pairwise compar - isons evaluated via two diﬀerent weight calculation techniques from an information retrieval point of view . Incompleteness means that the comparisons between some pairs of objects are missing . In case of consistent data , this absent information is preserved in the results of the compared pairs . However , in real problems , the results of comparisons are usually not consistent , therefore this missing information can cause signiﬁcant modiﬁcations in the evaluations . The main question of the ( Bozóki and Szádoczki , 2022 ) and ( Szádoczki et al . , 2022 ) is which structure of the comparisons is optimal for ﬁxed numbers of comparisons investigating pairwise comparison matrices via the logarithmic least squares and the eigen - vector methods ( LLSM and EM ) . We ask the same question in case of the Bradley - Terry ( BT ) model , when the evaluation is performed via maximum likelihood estimation ( MLE ) . What are the similarities and the diﬀerences of the optimal comparisons’ arrangements in case of LLSM and BT ? Do the ﬁndings of the papers remain valid in the case of a sub - stantially diﬀerent paired comparison method ? Are the conclusions method - speciﬁc , i . e . , do the results of the paper ( Bozóki and Szádoczki , 2022 ) apply only for the method LLSM and EM or in general as well , for other models based on paired comparisons ? The rest of the paper is organized as follows . Section 2 presents the closely related literature and the research gap that we would like to consider in the current study . Sec - tion 3 describes the preliminary methods , namely the AHP with LLSM , EM and the Bradley - Terry model with MLE . In Section 4 we describe the connection between these models . We pay special attention to consistency , which is deeply investigated in PCM - based methods , but not in stochastic models . Subsection 4 . 1 contains theoretical results about the connection of the models in consistent cases , while Subsection 4 . 2 presents ex - amples demonstrating the diﬀerences if the data are inconsistent . Section 5 details the 2 simulation methodology that is used to ﬁnd optimal solutions concerning information re - trieval , while Section 6 contains the main results of the numerical experiments . Finally , Section 7 concludes and discusses further research questions . 2 Literature review Applying the method of paired comparisons is essential in psychology ( Thurstone , 1927 ) , sports ( Csató , 2021 ; Orbán - Mihálykó et al . , 2022 ) , preference modelling ( Choo and Wed - ley , 2004 ; Mantik et al . , 2022 ) , ranking ( Fürnkranz and Hüllermeier , 2011 ; Shah and Wain - wright , 2018 ) , and decision making methods ( Stewart , 1992 ) . Through the concept of consistency / inconsistency , we compare some recent results ( Bozóki and Szádoczki , 2022 ) gained on the domain of PCMs used by the popular multi - attribute decision making method Analytic Hierarchy Process ( AHP ) ( Saaty , 1977 ) to the outcomes provided by the also widely used Bradley - Terry model ( Bradley and Terry , 1952 ) . The latter one is a special case of the more general Thurstone motivated stochastic models . Both these stochastic methods and the generalization of the AHP can be used on incomplete data , when some of the paired comparisons are missing ( Harker , 1987 ; Ishizaka and Labib , 2011 ) , which is often demonstrated on sport examples ( Orbán - Mihálykó et al . , 2019 ; Bozóki et al . , 2016 ) . However , in this regard , several theoretical questions have been investigated in the most recent literature ( Chen et al . , 2022 ) . AHP - based and stochastic Thurstone - motivated models are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in their fundamental concepts . In case of two diﬀerent principles of a problem’s solution , the linkage between them is always motivational : what are the common features and the diﬀerences of the methods . As far as the authors know , only few publications are devoted to this question . Researchers usually deal with one of the methods . However , in ( MacKay et al . , 1996 ) , the authors recognize the following : ‘the two branches resemble each other in that both may be used to estimate unidimensional scale values for decision alternatives or stimuli from pairwise preference judgments about pairs of stimuli . The models diﬀer in other respects . ’ Nevertheless , in ( Genest and M’lan , 1999 ) the authors compare the AHP based methods and the Bradley - Terry model in case of complete comparisons and they prove that in special cases some diﬀerent types of techniques provide equal solutions . In ( Orbán - Mihálykó et al . , 2015 ) , the authors compared numerically the AHP and Thurstone methods : evaluating a real data set on a 5 - value scale , the numerical results provided by 3 the diﬀerent methods were very close to each other . Further numerical comparisons for incomplete data can be found in ( Orbán - Mihálykó et al . , 2019 ) . Consistency / inconsistency of PCMs is a focal issue in the case of pairwise comparisons ( Brunelli , 2018 ; Duleba and Moslem , 2019 ) , but it is not investigated in stochastic models . The results’ compatibility with real experiences are related to inconsistency of the PCM : discrepancy may appear even in the case of complete comparisons . The question necessarily raises : what does the consistency mean in BT model ? Nowadays , more and more attention is paid to incomplete comparisons , as it is a part of information recovery . In case of missing comparisons there are two further aspects that have crucial eﬀect on the results in every model , namely , the number of known entries , and their arrangement . Our approach is strongly relying on the graph representation of incomplete paired comparisons ( Gass , 1998 ) . We are determining the best representing graphs ( the best pattern of known comparisons ) in the Bradley - Terry model for all possible number of comparisons ( edges ) for given number of alternatives ( vertices ) . The importance of the pattern of known comparisons in PCMs has been investigated for some special cases by ( Szádoczki et al . , 2022 ) , who emphasized the eﬀect of ( quasi - ) regularity and the minimal diameter ( longest shortest path ) property of the representing graphs . ( Szádoczki et al . , 2022 ) also examined some additional ordinal information in the examples studied by them . Finally , ( Bozóki and Szádoczki , 2022 ) have investigated all the possible ﬁlling in patterns of incomplete PCMs , and determined the best ones for all possible ( n , e ) pairs up until 6 alternatives with the help of simulations , where n is the number of items to be compared , while e is the number of compared pairs . Their main ﬁndings ( besides the concrete graphs ) are ( i ) the star - graph is always optimal among spanning trees ; ( ii ) regularity and bipartiteness are important properties of optimal ﬁlling patterns . To the best of the authors’ knowledge , there has been no similar study in case of the family of stochastic models , thus in this paper we would like to ﬁll in this research gap , too . 4 3 Preliminaries of the applied methods 3 . 1 Analytic Hierarchy Process The AHP methodology is based on PCMs , which can be used to evaluate alternatives according to a criterion or to compare the importance of the diﬀerent criteria . Deﬁnition 1 ( Pairwise comparison matrix ( PCM ) ) Let us denote the number of items to be compared ( usually criteria or alternatives ) in a decision problem by n . The n × n matrix A = [ a ij ] is called a pairwise comparison matrix , if it is positive ( a ij > 0 for ∀ i and j and reciprocal ( 1 / a ij = a ji for ∀ i and j ) . a ij , the general element of a PCM , shows how many times item i is better / more im - portant than item j . In an ideal case these elements are not contradicting to each other , thus we are dealing with a consistent PCM . Deﬁnition 2 ( Consistent PCM ) A PCM is called consistent if a ik = a ij a jk for ∀ i , j , k . If a PCM is not consistent , then it is said to be inconsistent . In practical problems , the PCMs ﬁlled in by decision makers are usually not consistent , and because of that , there is a large literature of how to measure the inconsistency of these matrices ( Brunelli , 2018 ) . Recently even a general framework has been proposed for deﬁning inconsistency indices of reciprocal pairwise comparisons ( Bortot et al . , 2022 ) . In case of consistent PCMs all the diﬀerent weight calculation techniques result in the same weight ( prioritization / preference ) vector that determines the ranking of the compared items . However , for inconsistent data , the results of diﬀerent weight calculation methods can vary . Two of the most commonly used techniques are the logarithmic least squares method ( Crawford and Williams , 1985 ) and the eigenvector method ( Saaty , 1977 ) . Deﬁnition 3 ( Logarithmic Least Squares Method ( LLSM ) ) Let A be an n × n PCM . The weight vector w of A determined by the LLSM is given as follows : min w n (cid:88) i = 1 n (cid:88) j = 1 (cid:18) ln ( a ij ) − ln (cid:18) w i w j (cid:19)(cid:19) 2 , ( 1 ) where w i is the i - th element of w , 0 < w i and (cid:80) ni = 1 w i = 1 . 5 Deﬁnition 4 ( Eigenvector Method ( EM ) ) Let A be an n × n PCM . The weight vector w of A determined by the EM is deﬁned as follows : A · w = λ max · w ( 2 ) where λ max is the principal eigenvalue of A , and the componentwise positive eigenvector w is unique up to a scalar multiplication . These techniques can be generalized to the case , when some elements are absent from the PCM , when we have to deal with an incomplete pairwise comparison matrix ( IPCM ) . For IPCMs the LLSM’s optimization problem only includes the known elements of the matrix , while the EM is based on the Consistency Ratio - minimal completion of the IPCM and its principal right eigenvector ( Shiraishi et al . , 1998 ; Shiraishi and Obata , 2002 ; Bozóki et al . , 2010 ) . It is also worth mentioning that the inconsistency indices and their respective thresholds can also be generalized for the IPCM case ( Ágoston and Csató , 2022 ; Kułakowski and Talaga , 2020 ) . A suitable tool to handle IPCMs is to use their graph representation ( Gass , 1998 ) . Deﬁnition 5 ( Representing graph of an IPCM ) An IPCM A is represented by the undirected graph G E = ( V , E ) , where the vertex set V of G E corresponds to the items to be compared ( alternatives / criteria ) of A , and there is an edge in the edge set E of G E if and only if the appropriate element of A is known . The generalized deﬁnition of a consistent PCM in the incomplete case is as follows ( Bozóki and Tsyganok , 2019 ) : Deﬁnition 6 ( Consistent IPCM ) An incomplete pairwise comparison matrix ( IPCM ) A represented by the graph G E = ( V , E ) is called consistent , if a i 1 i 2 · a i 2 i 3 · . . . · a i k i 1 = 1 ( 3 ) for any cycle in G E that is ( i 1 , i 2 , . . . , i k , i 1 ) , for which ( i l , i l + 1 ) ∈ E and ( i k , i 1 ) ∈ E . 6 3 . 2 Stochastic approach : the Bradley - Terry model From the stochastic branch , this paper investigates the Bradley - Terry model ( BT ) for two options , worse and better . It is a special case of the more general Thurstone motivated model , in which the performances of the objects are considered to be random variables ξ i with expected values m i , i = 1 , 2 , . . . , n . The result of a comparison is connected to the realized value of the diﬀerence of the random variables ξ i − ξ j = m i − m j + η i , j . If the result of the comparison is that ‘ i is worse than j ’ , then the diﬀerence is negative . Vice versa , the comparison result that ‘ i is better than j ’ means that the diﬀerence of the random variables belonging to the objects i and j is non - negative . Of course , ‘ i is worse than j ’ means that ‘ j is better than i ’ . η i , j ( i < j ) are supposed to be independent continuous random variables with common cumulative distribution function ( c . d . f . ) F . The probability density function f is supposed to be symmetric , positive on R , and its logarithm is strictly concave . The probabilities of the above - mentioned events ( worse and better ) , due to the sym - metry , are as follows . p i , j , 1 = P ( ξ i − ξ j < 0 ) = F ( 0 − ( m i − m j ) ) = F ( m j − m i ) = p j , i , 2 ( 4 ) p i , j , 2 = P ( 0 ≤ ξ i − ξ j ) = 1 − p i , j , 1 = F ( m i − m j ) = p j , i , 1 ( 5 ) If F is the standard normal cumulative distribution function , then we are dealing with the Thurstone model . In the case , when F ( x ) = 1 1 + exp ( − x ) , ( 6 ) the c . d . f . of the logistic distribution , then we are applying the BT model . In case of the BT model , one can check that p i , j , 1 = exp ( m j ) exp ( m i ) + exp ( m j ) , ( 7 ) and p i , j , 2 = exp ( m i ) exp ( m i ) + exp ( m j ) . ( 8 ) In the rest of the paper , we focus on the case of logistic distribution . Let D i , j , 1 be the number of comparisons when ‘ i is worse than j ’ and let D i , j , 2 be the number of comparisons 7 when ‘ i is better than j ’ . For the sake of simplicity , D i , i , 1 = D i , i , 2 = 0 . Data matrix D contains the elements D i , j , k , and its dimension is n × n × 2 . Obviously D i , j , 1 = D j , i , 2 and D i , j , 2 = D j , i , 1 , and the data matrix can also be written in a two dimensional matrix form as follows : the row number is the number of pairs for which i < j , n ( n − 1 ) / 2 , while the number of columns is the number of options ( better and worse ) , 2 . We use the same notation D for both data forms . If the decisions are independent , the probability of sample D as a function of the parameters is as follows , L ( D | m ) = n − 1 (cid:89) i = 1 n (cid:89) j = i + 1 p D i , j , 1 i , j , 1 · p D i , j , 2 i , j , 2 . ( 9 ) The maximum likelihood estimation ( MLE ) of the parameter vector m is the n di - mensional argument (cid:98) m for which function ( 9 ) reaches its maximal value . As ( 9 ) depends only on the diﬀerences of the expected values , one parameter can be ﬁxed ( for example m 1 = 0 ) . Supposing this , in ( Ford Jr , 1957 ) the author proves a necessary and suﬃcient condition which guarantees the existence and uniqueness of the MLE in the BT model : the directed graph of the comparisons has to be strongly connected . In this case the vertices are the items to compare , as previously , and there is a directed edge from item i to item j if 0 < D i , j , 2 and from item j to item i if 0 < D i , j , 1 ( i < j ) . Instead of ( 9 ) , frequently the log - likelihood , ln L ( D | m ) = n − 1 (cid:88) i = 1 n (cid:88) j = i + 1 ( D i , j , 1 · ln ( p i , j , 1 ) + D i , j , 2 · ln ( p i , j , 2 ) ) , ( 10 ) is maximized . Its maximum value is at the same argument , as the maximum of ( 9 ) . The condition for the existence and uniqueness of the maximal point is the same , as mentioned before . Note , that the matrix D can be multiplied by an arbitrary positive number , and the argument of the maximal value of ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) does not change . This can be easily seen from ( 10 ) . This means , that the values of D i , j , k , k = 1 , 2 are not necessarily integer or rational numbers . We will use this property during the investigations in the next section . 8 4 Connection between the BT and PCM models 4 . 1 Consistent data matrix’s evaluation The vector of the estimated expected values (cid:98) m can be converted into a weight vector by a strictly monotone transformation as follows : (cid:98) w = (cid:18) exp ( (cid:98) m 1 ) (cid:80) ni = 1 exp ( (cid:98) m i ) , . . . , exp ( (cid:98) m n ) (cid:80) ni = 1 exp ( (cid:98) m i ) (cid:19) . ( 11 ) Similarly , if the exact expected values m were known , a weight ( priority ) vector could be constructed by their help as follows : w = (cid:18) exp ( m 1 ) (cid:80) ni = 1 exp ( m i ) , . . . , exp ( m n ) (cid:80) ni = 1 exp ( m i ) (cid:19) . ( 12 ) This transformation eliminates the eﬀect of the ﬁxed parameter . The weights are positive and their sum equals to 1 , as in the case of AHP . Now starting from a normalized vector with positive components w ( PCM ) = (cid:16) w ( PCM ) 1 , . . . , w ( PCM ) n (cid:17) , ( 13 ) we can construct a PCM , containing the ratios of the coordinates a i , j = w ( PCM ) i w ( PCM ) j , i = 1 , 2 , . . . , n , j = 1 , 2 , . . . , n . ( 14 ) Similarly , taking the ratios of the coordinates of ( 12 ) , a PCM can be constructed , whose elements are the exponential values of the diﬀerences of the expected values : a ( BT ) i , j = exp ( m i − m j ) i = 1 , 2 , . . . , n , j = 1 , 2 , . . . , n . In the case of BT , due to ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) , these ratios are exactly the ratios of the probabilities of ‘better’ and ‘worse’ . It is a well - known fact , that , in the case of AHP , either EM or LLSM is applied , supposing a complete and consistent PCM composed by ( 14 ) , the starting vector w ( PCM ) will be the result of the methods . On the other hand , if the PCM is complete and consistent , its elements can be expressed as the ratios of the components of a weight vector . This priority vector equals the result of the evaluation of the PCM via LLSM or EM . From ( Bozóki et al . , 2010 ) it is also known that in the case of incomplete comparisons , the existence and uniqueness of the computed priority vector of EM and LLSM holds if and only 9 if the representing graph of the comparisons ( see Deﬁnition 5 ) is connected . This implies that even in the case of incomplete comparisons with a consistent IPCM constructed by ( 14 ) , if the representing graph is connected , then the starting w ( PCM ) would be recovered by LLSM and EM , too . Accordingly , in the following , we state a theorem which proves that if the coeﬃcients D i , j , k are the exact probabilities of the possible comparisons’ results , then the MLE recovers the exact expected values in both complete and incomplete cases . First , let K = { ( i , j ) : i (cid:54) = j } be the pairs of all possible comparisons . In the case of incomplete comparisons , let I ⊂ K with pairs i < j . Every subset I deﬁnes a representing graph G I , exactly as in Deﬁnition 5 . Theorem 1 Let F be the logistic c . d . f . ( 6 ) . Let our starting vector be m ( 0 ) = ( 0 , m ( 0 ) 2 , . . . , m ( 0 ) n ) , an arbitrary expected value vector with a ﬁxed ﬁrst coordinate . Let the data belonging to m ( 0 ) be deﬁned as follows : D ( d ) i , j , 1 = F ( m ( 0 ) j − m ( 0 ) i ) , ( 15 ) and D ( d ) i , j , 2 = F ( m ( 0 ) i − m ( 0 ) j ) . ( 16 ) Let the incomplete data matrix D ( m ( 0 ) ) be deﬁned as follows : D ( m ( 0 ) ) i , j , 1 = D ( m ( 0 ) ) j , i , 2 = D ( d ) i , j , 1 and D ( m ( 0 ) ) i , j , 2 = D ( m ( 0 ) ) j , i , 1 = D ( d ) i , j , 2 if ( i , j ) ∈ I and zero otherwise . Fix the ﬁrst coordinate of m at 0 . If the graph belonging to I is connected , then the log - likelihood function , ln L ( D ( m ( 0 ) ) | m ) = (cid:88) i < j , ( i , j ) ∈ I (cid:16) D ( m ( 0 ) ) i , j , 1 · ln p i , j , 1 + D ( m ( 0 ) ) i , j , 2 · ln p i , j , 2 (cid:17) , ( 17 ) attains its maximal value at (cid:98) m = m ( 0 ) and the argument of the maximal value is unique . Proof . First we note that the connectedness of the graph deﬁned by I and its strongly connected property are equivalent in this case , as both D ( m ( 0 ) ) i , j , 1 and D ( m ( 0 ) ) i , j , 2 are positive in the case of ( i , j ) ∈ I . Recalling that D ( m ( 0 ) ) i , j , 1 + D ( m ( 0 ) ) i , j , 2 = 1 and p i , j , 2 = 1 − p i , j , 1 , ( 17 ) has the following form : B ( x 1 , . . . , x k ) = k (cid:88) s = 1 C s · ln x s + ( 1 − C s ) · ln ( 1 − x s ) , 0 < x s < 1 , 0 < C s < 1 . ( 18 ) 10 where C s = D ( m ( 0 ) ) i , j , 1 , x s = p i , j , 1 , k is the number of elements ( i , j ) in the set I for which i < j and we made a one - to - one correspondence Z between these pairs in I and the positive integers 1 , 2 , . . . , k , Z ( i , j ) = s , ( i , j ) ∈ I , i < j . If we consider the multivariate function ( 18 ) , we can see that it takes its maximal value at (cid:101) x s = C s , s = 1 , 2 , . . . , k , and the argument of the maximum is unique . Now the question is whether C can be expressed by an expected value vector , for example in the form C s = F ( m j − m i ) , Z ( i , j ) = s . It does not hold for an arbitrary vector C , but since C s = D ( m ( 0 ) ) i , j , 1 , ( Z ( i , j ) = s ) , then m ( 0 ) provides a possible solution for the above question , C s = F ( m ( 0 ) j − m ( 0 ) i ) , due to the construction of the coeﬃcients . On the other hand , taking into account the connectedness of the graph deﬁned by I , the condition in ( Ford Jr , 1957 ) is satisﬁed , therefore the argument maximizing ( 17 ) , (cid:98) m , is unique . These together imply that (cid:98) m = m ( 0 ) . First , we note that Theorem 1 remains true if the coeﬃcients C s are multiplied by a positive constant value , therefore only the ratios of D ( m ( 0 ) ) i , j , k are relevant . Theorem 1 states that if the coeﬃcients are the exact probabilities belonging to an expected value vector , then the maximum likelihood estimation reproduces the exact ex - pected value vector . In addition , starting out of an expected value vector , computing the exact probabilities by ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) , moreover constructing a consistent IPCM matrix from the ratios of the probabilities p i , j , 2 / p i , j , 1 , LLSM , EM and the priority vector of BT ( 12 ) are the same weight vectors . In these special cases the results of the three methods correspond even for incomplete comparisons . The fact that the coeﬃcients are the exact probabilities belonging to an expected value vector means that there is no contradiction in them . On the other hand , the property of ‘free of contradictions’ is described by the concept of con - sistency in the case of PCM and IPCM matrices . Additionally , in Subsection 3 . 2 the data D i , j , 1 and D i , j , 2 are integer , not probabilities . Still if they are all positive , a complete PCM matrix can be composed by taking the ratios D i , j , 2 / D i , j , 1 and D i , j , 1 / D i , j , 2 . If for a certain pair ( i , j ) D i , j , 1 = 0 and / or D i , j , 2 = 0 , the IPCM matrix will not contain the element a i , j and a j , i . The consistency of an incomplete PCM is given in Deﬁnition 6 . Taking this deﬁnition as the basis , we deﬁne the concept of consistent data in the case of the BT model as follows . Let I be the subset of those pairs for which there exist comparisons and both data are positive , i . e , I = { ( i , j ) : i (cid:54) = j , 0 < D i , j , 1 , 0 < D i , j , 2 } ⊆ K . 11 Deﬁnition 7 Let I ⊂ K , and let the graph G I be connected . Introduce h i , j = D i , j , 2 D i , j , 1 , ( i , j ) ∈ I . Data matrix D is called consistent in I , if for any cycle in G I , that is ( i 1 , i 2 , . . . , i k , i 1 ) , with ( i l , i l + 1 ) ∈ I and ( i k , i 1 ) ∈ I h i 1 , i 2 · h i 2 , i 3 · . . . · h i k , i 1 = 1 . ( 19 ) Data matrix D is called inconsistent in I if it is not consistent in I . Data consistency is deﬁned by the consistency of IPCM constructed by the ratios of the appropriate data in D . Now we prove the following statement , which is an equivalent form , but presents another feature of data consistency in the BT model : Theorem 2 Let I deﬁne a connected graph . Data matrix D is consistent in I if and only if there exists an m ( 0 ) ∈ R n , m ( 0 ) = ( 0 , m ( 0 ) 2 , . . . , m ( 0 ) n ) for which D i , j , 2 D i , j , 1 = F ( m ( 0 ) i − m ( 0 ) j ) F ( m ( 0 ) j − m ( 0 ) i ) , ( i , j ) ∈ I ( 20 ) Proof . As a ﬁrst step , let I be a spanning tree . As 0 < D i , j , 1 and 0 < D i , j , 2 if ( i , j ) ∈ I , we know that the graph G I is strongly connected , the MLE exists and it is unique . Let us investigate the log - likelihood function in the form of a multivariate function , as in Theorem 1 , with the coeﬃcients D i , j , 1 and D i , j , 2 ( see ( 18 ) ) . Taking the partial derivatives with respect to x s , we can conclude that the maximum is at (cid:98) x s = D i , j , 1 / ( D i , j , 1 + D i , j , 2 ) . We have to prove that there exists an n dimensional vector m ( 0 ) = ( 0 , m ( 0 ) 2 , . . . m ( 0 ) n ) , for which D i , j , 1 / ( D i , j , 1 + D i , j , 2 ) = F ( m ( 0 ) j − m ( 0 ) i ) . For that , consider the following form : m j − m i = F − 1 (cid:18) D i , j , 1 D i , j , 1 + D i , j , 2 (cid:19) . ( 21 ) It is easy to see that this system of linear equations can be uniquely solved if ( i , j ) ∈ I , after ﬁxing m 1 = 0 . Denoting the solution by m ( 0 ) = ( 0 , m ( 0 ) 2 , . . . , m ( 0 ) n ) , we get D i , j , 2 D i , j , 1 = F ( m ( 0 ) i − m ( 0 ) j ) F ( m ( 0 ) j − m ( 0 ) i ) = exp ( m ( 0 ) i ) exp ( m ( 0 ) j ) . ( 22 ) We note that if I is a spanning tree , but D i , j , 1 = 0 or D i , j , 2 = 0 for some ( i , j ) ∈ I , then the MLE does not exist , as the necessary and suﬃcient condition given by Ford is not satisﬁed . 12 In the second step , let I be a general subset of K with 0 < D i , j , 1 and 0 < D i , j , 2 if ( i , j ) ∈ I , moreover assume that I deﬁnes a connected graph . Take a spanning tree I b ⊆ I . Let m ( 0 ) = (cid:98) m I b , the MLE of the expected value vector belonging to the data set D i , j , k , ( i , j ) ∈ I b . Now ( 20 ) is satisﬁed if ( i , j ) ∈ I b . If ( i , j ) / ∈ I b , there exists a cycle in I , ( i 1 , i 2 , . . . , i k , i 1 , ) i 1 = i , i k = j , ( i 1 , i 2 ) , ( i 2 , i 3 ) , . . . , ( i k − 1 , i k ) ∈ I b . Therefore , for l = 1 , 2 , . . . k − 1 , h i l , i l + 1 = D i l , i l + 1 , 2 D i l , i l + 1 , 1 = F ( m ( 0 ) i l + 1 − m ( 0 ) i l ) F ( m ( 0 ) i l − m ( 0 ) i l + 1 ) = exp ( m ( 0 ) i l ) exp ( m ( 0 ) i l + 1 ) . ( 23 ) Taking the productions of these quantities along the path from i to j and applying ( 19 ) , the left hand side is 1 h j , i = h i , j , while the right hand side equals exp ( m ( 0 ) i ) exp ( m ( 0 ) j ) = F ( m ( 0 ) i − m ( 0 ) j ) F ( m ( 0 ) j − m ( 0 ) i ) , ( 24 ) which proves ( 20 ) for any ( i , j ) ∈ I . Conversely , assume that D i , j , 2 D i , j , 1 = F ( m ( 0 ) i − m ( 0 ) j ) F ( m ( 0 ) j − m ( 0 ) i ) ( 25 ) if ( i , j ) ∈ I . Applying again the equality F ( m ( 0 ) i − m ( 0 ) j ) F ( m ( 0 ) j − m ( 0 ) i ) = exp ( m ( 0 ) i ) exp ( m ( 0 ) j ) , ( 26 ) and taking their product on a cycle ( i 1 , i 2 , . . . , i k , i 1 ) with ( i l , i l + 1 ) ∈ I , ( i k , i 1 ) ∈ I , after simpliﬁcation we get ( 19 ) , namely h i 1 , i 2 · h i 2 , i 3 · . . . · h i k , i 1 = 1 . ( 27 ) We note , that if D is consistent in I and G I is a connected graph , then m ( 0 ) = ( 0 , m ( 0 ) 2 , . . . , m ( 0 ) n ) in ( 20 ) is unique . Recalling Theorem 1 , m ( 0 ) equals to the evaluation of the MLE . The ﬁnal conclusion of Subsection 4 . 1 , that in the case of consistent com - parison data D and connected representing graph , the evaluations of BT , LLSM and EM provide the same priority vector . In other words , the results of these three methods coin - cide both in complete and incomplete cases . The ratio D i , j , 2 D i , j , 1 is common in sports results’ 13 evaluations : the ratios of the number of wins and defeats often appear in PCMs ( for ex - ample in ( Bozóki et al . , 2016 ) ) . Therefore , in this case , supposing consistent data , the evaluation of BT , LLSM and EM would be the same . As an example , consider D =   D 1 , 2 , 1 D 1 , 2 , 2 D 1 , 3 , 1 D 1 , 3 , 2 D 1 , 4 , 1 D 1 , 4 , 2 D 2 , 3 , 1 D 2 , 3 , 2 D 2 , 4 , 1 D 2 , 4 , 2 D 3 , 4 , 1 D 3 , 4 , 2   =   1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 1   . ( 28 ) The PCM constructed on the basis of these data is A =     1 D 1 , 2 , 2 D 1 , 2 , 1 D 1 , 3 , 2 D 1 , 3 , 1 D 1 , 4 , 2 D 1 , 4 , 1 D 1 , 2 , 1 D 1 , 2 , 2 1 D 2 , 3 , 2 D 2 , 3 , 1 D 2 , 4 , 2 D 2 , 4 , 1 D 1 , 3 , 1 D 1 , 3 , 2 D 2 , 3 , 1 D 2 , 3 , 2 1 D 3 , 4 , 2 D 3 , 4 , 1 D 1 , 4 , 1 D 1 , 4 , 2 D 2 , 4 , , 1 D 2 , 4 , 2 D 3 , 4 , 1 D 3 , 4 , 2 1     =     1 2 2 1 12 1 1 12 12 1 1 12 1 2 2 1     . ( 29 ) One can easily check that data matrix D is consistent and so is A . Performing MLE in BT model , the estimated expected value vector equals (cid:98) m = ( 0 , − 0 . 693 , − 0 . 693 , 0 ) ( 30 ) and the priority vector is (cid:98) w ( BT ) = ( 1 3 , 1 6 , 1 6 , 1 3 ) . ( 31 ) One can check that , applying PCM A , LLSM and EM also provide the same priority vector . 4 . 2 Inconsistent data matrices’ evaluations In Subsection 4 . 1 , we proved that in case of consistent comparison data , LLSM , EM and BT result in the same priority vectors . However , the following example demonstrate that in case of inconsistent data , the three method provide diﬀerent priority vectors both for complete and incomplete cases . 14 Let n = 4 , m ( 0 ) = ( 0 , 0 . 25 , 0 . 75 , 1 . 75 ) . The probabilities of the comparisons’ results are D ( m ( 0 ) ) =   p 1 , 2 , 1 p 1 , 2 , 2 p 1 , 3 , 1 p 1 , 3 , 2 p 1 , 4 , 1 p 1 , 4 , 2 p 2 , 3 , 1 p 2 , 3 , 2 p 2 , 4 , 1 p 2 , 4 , 2 p 3 , 4 , 1 p 3 , 4 , 2   =   0 . 562 0 . 438 0 . 679 0 . 321 0 . 852 0 . 148 0 . 622 0 . 378 0 . 818 0 . 182 0 . 731 0 . 269   . ( 32 ) These data are consistent . If we modify p 3 , 4 , 1 and p 3 , 4 , 2 by subtracting / adding 0 . 2 , we get the modiﬁed data matrix D ( mod ) =     p 1 , 2 , 1 p 1 , 2 , 2 p 1 , 3 , 1 p 1 , 3 , 2 p 1 , 4 , 1 p 1 , 4 , 2 p 2 , 3 , 1 p 2 , 3 , 2 p 2 , 4 , 1 p 2 , 4 , 2 p ( mod ) 3 , 4 , 1 p ( mod ) 3 , 4 , 2     =     0 . 562 0 . 438 0 . 679 0 . 321 0 . 852 0 . 148 0 . 622 0 . 378 0 . 818 0 . 182 0 . 531 0 . 469     . ( 33 ) One can check that D ( mod ) is inconsistent . The corresponding PCM is A =   1 p 1 , 2 , 2 p 1 , 2 , 1 p 1 , 3 , 2 p 1 , 3 , 1 p 1 , 4 , 2 p 1 , 4 , 1 p 1 , 2 , 1 p 1 , 2 , 2 1 p 2 , 3 , 2 p 2 , 3 , 1 p 2 , 4 , 2 p 2 , 4 , 1 p 1 , 3 , 1 p 1 , 3 , 2 p 2 , 3 , 1 p 2 , 3 , 2 1 p ( mod ) 3 , 4 , 2 p ( mod ) 3 , 4 , 1 p 1 , 4 , 1 p 1 , 4 , 2 p 2 , 4 , 1 p 2 , 4 , 2 p ( mod ) 3 , 4 , 1 p ( mod ) 3 , 4 , 2 1   =   1 0 . 779 0 . 472 0 . 174 1 . 284 1 0 . 607 0 . 223 2 . 117 1 . 649 1 0 . 883 5 . 755 4 . 482 1 . 132 1   . ( 34 ) One can easily check that A is not consistent . For example , take a 1 , 3 a 1 , 4 = 0 . 472 0 . 174 = 2 . 713 (cid:54) = a 4 , 3 = 1 . 132 . ( 35 ) The result vectors computed by LLSM and EM are w ( LLSM ) = ( 0 . 105 , 0 . 135 , 0 . 276 , 0 . 484 ) , ( 36 ) 15 w ( EM ) = ( 0 . 103 , 0 . 132 , 0 . 279 , 0 . 485 ) . ( 37 ) If we evaluate data matrix D ( mod ) by BT via MLE , the estimated expected values are (cid:98) m = ( 0 , 0 . 246 , 0 . 954 , 1 . 450 ) . ( 38 ) Transforming this into a weight vector we get (cid:98) w ( BT ) = ( 0 . 109 , 0 . 140 , 0 . 284 , 0 . 466 ) . ( 39 ) (cid:98) w ( BT ) diﬀers from w ( LLSM ) and w ( EM ) , demonstrating that , in the case of inconsistent data , the evaluations of LLSM , EM and BT provide diﬀerent results . We can observe the same phenomenon if we restrict the data to the set I = { ( 1 , 2 ) , ( 1 , 3 ) , ( 1 , 4 ) , ( 3 , 4 ) , ( 2 , 1 ) , ( 3 , 1 ) , ( 4 , 1 ) , ( 4 , 3 ) } , that is we evaluate incomplete comparisons . D ( mod ) I =   p 1 , 2 , 1 p 1 , 2 , 2 p 1 , 3 , 1 p 1 , 3 , 2 p 1 , 4 , 1 p 1 , 4 , 2 p ( mod ) 3 , 4 , 1 p ( mod ) 3 , 4 , 2   =   0 . 562 0 . 438 0 . 679 0 . 321 0 . 852 0 . 148 0 . 531 0 . 469   ( 40 ) Now , the incomplete PCM A I looks as follows , A I =   1 p 1 , 2 , 2 p 1 , 2 , 1 p 1 , 3 , 2 p 1 , 3 , 1 p 1 , 4 , 2 p 1 , 4 , 1 p 1 , 2 , 1 p 1 , 2 , 2 1 ∗ ∗ p 1 , 3 , 1 p 1 , 3 , 2 ∗ 1 p ( mod ) 3 , 4 , 2 p ( mod ) 3 , 4 , 1 p 1 , 4 , 1 p 1 , 4 , 2 ∗ p ( mod ) 3 , 4 , 1 p ( mod ) 3 , 4 , 2 1   =   1 0 . 779 0 . 472 0 . 174 1 . 284 1 * * 2 . 117 * 1 0 . 883 5 . 755 * 1 . 132 1   . ( 41 ) It is inconsistent for the same reason as it was presented in ( 35 ) . Its evaluation by LLSM and EM are w ( LLSM ) I = ( 0 . 106 , 0 . 136 , 0 . 301 , 0 . 457 ) , ( 42 ) 16 and w ( EM ) I = ( 0 . 107 , 0 . 134 , 0 . 302 , 0 . 458 ) , ( 43 ) respectively . Applying the incomplete and inconsistent data matrix D ( mod ) I , estimating the expected values by BT via MLE and taking the priority vector , the result is diﬀerent from ( 42 ) and also from ( 43 ) , namely (cid:98) m I = ( 0 , 0 . 250 , 1 . 017 , 1 . 366 ) ( 44 ) and (cid:98) w ( BT ) I = ( 0 . 112 , 0 . 143 , 0 . 308 , 0 . 437 ) . ( 45 ) This incomplete example demonstrates that all three investigated methods , namely BT , LLSM and EM may provide diﬀerent results during the evaluations . 5 Evaluating information retrieval from incomplete com - parisons We are applying Monte - Carlo simulations to investigate the information retrieval from incomplete comparisons in case of the BT model . The steps of the simulations with expla - nations are the following . 1 . Generate n random integer values from 1 to 9 with uniform distribution and normalize them . In this way a random weight ( priority ) vector is created . This will be the initial priority vector belonging to BT . 2 . Take the logarithm of all coordinates and decrease the new components by the ﬁrst one . A random vector with zero ﬁrst coordinate is now constructed . This vector serve as the initial random expected value vector in the BT model . 3 . Calculate the exact probabilities of the comparison results by ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) for all possible pairs . A consistent and complete system of the comparisons’ results has been generated . 17 4 . As previously presented , based on consistent comparison results MLE recovers the initial expected values both in complete and incomplete cases . Because of that , perturbations are made on the consistent results as follows : each value D ( m ( 0 ) ) i , j , 1 are modiﬁed by adding to them independent uniformly distributed random numbers on [ − perturb , perturb ] . The value of perturb can be chosen between 0 and 1 . The perturbed values pert D ( m ( 0 ) ) i , j , 1 are claimed to be strictly between 0 and 1 . 5 . Compute pert D i , j , 2 by pert D ( m ( 0 ) ) i , j , 2 = 1 − pert D ( m ( 0 ) ) i , j , 1 . As 0 < pert D ( m ( 0 ) ) i , j , 1 < 1 , so is pert D ( m ( 0 ) ) i , j , 2 . 6 . Use the previously constructed complete comparisons’ results as data in BT model , and evaluate them via MLE . The outcome expected value vector is (cid:98) m K . The outcome priority vector is (cid:98) w K . 7 . Compute the results belonging to the diﬀerent graph structures as follows . For each possible connected graph I : apply only the data belonging to the graph structure and perform MLE in BT model . By omitting a subset of comparisons incomplete and inconsistent data is considered . The existence and uniqueness of the evaluation is guaranteed by the connectedness and by 0 < pert D ( m ( 0 ) ) i , j , 1 < 1 and 0 < pert D ( m ( 0 ) ) i , j , 2 < 1 . The results of the evaluation in the case of graph structure I are denoted by (cid:98) m I and (cid:98) w I . 8 . The diﬀerences between the results belonging to the complete case and the graph structure I can be deﬁned by several measures . We used Euclidean distance of the estimated expected value vectors EU _ M = EU ( (cid:98) m K , (cid:98) m I ) = (cid:118)(cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:116) n (cid:88) i = 1 ( (cid:98) m Ki − (cid:98) m Ii ) 2 , ( 46 ) the Euclidean distances of the estimated weight vectors EU _ W = EU ( (cid:98) w K , (cid:98) w I ) = (cid:118)(cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:116) n (cid:88) i = 1 ( (cid:98) w Ki − (cid:98) w Ii ) 2 , ( 47 ) Pearson correlation coeﬃcient belonging to the expected values P E _ M = P E ( (cid:98) w K , (cid:98) w I ) = (cid:80) ni = 1 (cid:98) m Ki · (cid:98) m Ii n − (cid:98) m K · (cid:98) m I (cid:114) (cid:80) ni = 1 (cid:16)(cid:98) m Ki − (cid:98) m K (cid:17) 2 n (cid:114) (cid:80) ni = 1 (cid:16)(cid:99) m iI − (cid:98) m I (cid:17) 2 n , ( 48 ) 18 and belonging the priority vectors P E _ W = P E ( (cid:98) w K , (cid:98) w I ) = (cid:80) ni = 1 (cid:98) w Ki · (cid:98) w Ii n − (cid:98) w K · (cid:98) w I (cid:114) (cid:80) ni = 1 (cid:16)(cid:98) w Ki − (cid:98) w K (cid:17) 2 n (cid:114) (cid:80) ni = 1 (cid:16)(cid:98) w Ii − (cid:98) w I (cid:17) 2 n . ( 49 ) To investigate the similarities of the rankings , the Spearman ρ rank correlation ρ = ρ ( (cid:98) m K , (cid:98) m I ) = 1 − (cid:80) ni = 1 d 2 i 6 n ( n 2 − 1 ) ( 50 ) where d i is the diﬀerence in rankings of the i th object , and the Kendall τ rank correlations τ = τ ( (cid:98) m K , (cid:98) m I ) = 2 n ( n − 1 ) (cid:88) i < j sign ( (cid:98) m Ki − (cid:98) m Kj ) · sign ( (cid:98) m Ii − (cid:98) m Ij ) . ( 51 ) were applied . These rank correlations are the same either the expected value vectors’ or the priority vectors’ rankings are considered . The above - mentioned measurements characterize the deviations and the similarities in diﬀerent manner , hence provide diﬀerent measures of information retrieval . In case of Euclidean distances , the smaller the value , the more information is regained , and the less information is lost due to the incomplete comparisons . In case of the correlation coeﬃcients , the closer the result is to 1 , the more information is recovered . We call these measurements similarity measures and compute all of them for the diﬀerent graph structures . 9 . Repeat the steps 1 - 8 N times , where N is the number of simulations . These quantities are , of course , random quantities depending on the random values of the data matrix . Take the average and the dispersion of the similarity measures over the simulations . We do not know bounds for the values (cid:98) m but we do for the other measurements . As they are all bounded , therefore their expected values and variances are ﬁnite . Consequently , both the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem can be applied for them . The central limit theorem guarantees the ( u α · σ ) / √ N upper bound for the simulation error with reliability 1 - α if σ is an upper bound for the standard deviation of the random quantity , and Φ ( u α ) = 1 − α 2 . Now , the Euclidean distance of the weight vectors are less than √ 2 , the correlation coeﬃcients are between - 1 and 1 , therefore the standard deviations of these quantities are less than or equal to √ 22 and 1 , respectively . Using the upper bound 19 1 , ( u α · σ ) / √ N = ( 2 . 58 · 1 ) / √ N when the reliability is 1 - α = 0 . 99 . N = 10 6 simulations were carried out , thus the theoretical upper bound of the simulation error is 0 . 00258 . Of course , the estimated standard deviations are much less than the theoretical upper bounds , therefore the true simulation errors are much smaller than the theoretical values . They are usually of diﬀerent order of magnitude . Narrow conﬁdence intervals can be given in which the means of the quantities are situated with a given reliability . 6 Simulation results The examined number of objects to compare are n = 4 , 5 and 6 . In the case of n = 4 , together with the complete case , 6 graphs can be distinguished for deﬁning the set of comparisons . Two of them have 3 , two of them have 4 , one and one have 5 and 6 edges , respectively . In the case of n = 5 objects , the number of diﬀerent graphs is 21 . While in case of n = 6 , there are 112 diﬀerent possible graph structures . We can observe that in almost all cases , for a given number of objects and given number of comparisons each similarity measure marks the same graph to be the best . There are few exceptions for n = 6 and large numbers of edges , namely if e = 12 and 13 . In the case of e = 12 the best structure by ρ diﬀers from the best marked by the other measures . If the number of edges equals 13 , then the rank correlations ρ and τ indicate graph g109 to be the best , while the other measures indicate g110 . Although the numerical diﬀerences are small , this phenomenon appears independently of the value of the perturbation , moreover , in the case of PCM methods , too . The optimal graph structures , sequences and the exceptions are the same as it was presented in ( Bozóki and Szádoczki , 2022 ) . Figure 1 shows the optimal graphs for the diﬀerent completions levels . Graphs with e and e + 1 ( e = 7 , 8 , 9 ) edges are reachable from each other by the addition / deletion of a single ( orange ) edge . This observation supports that the most information retrieval belongs to the structure of the graph . The independence of the rankings from the similarity measures can be seen in Figure 2 : graphs g1 , g2 , . . . , g5 ( the complete graph g6 is omitted ) are in the same ranking according to all 6 measurements . It is important to note that the smaller EU _ M and EU _ W indicates the better information retrieval , while in case of PE _ M , PE _ W , ρ and τ the larger value is preferred . Figure 3 demonstrates that even the standard deviations 20 Figure 1 : Optimal graphs for n = 5 , e = 4 , 5 , . . . , 10 work the same way in case of choosing the best graph , keeping in mind that the smaller the standard deviation , the smaller the volatility in every measurement . See , for example , 21 τ deﬁned by ( 51 ) : the graph structure g2 is the worst and g5 is the best , as they have the smallest and largest average values , respectively . Investigating the dispersion , the largest value belongs to g2 and the smallest one is for the graph structure g5 . Figure 2 : Average measures of information retrieval in the case of diﬀerent graph structures : average distances deﬁned by ( 46 ) , ( 47 ) , average correlations deﬁned by ( 48 ) , ( 49 ) , ( 50 ) and ( 51 ) , respectively , comparing n = 4 objects and applying 0 . 15 perturbation . Based on the simulations , we can conclude that the larger the number of edges , the better the information retrieval . This observation is true in average and for the best graphs , as well , for all the examined number of objects ( 4 , 5 and 6 ) , for all the perturbation values and all the investigated measurements . Figure 4 presents the average distances , when the averages contain the data of the graphs with 5 , 6 , . . . , 14 edges independently of the graph structures . Figure 5 represents the averaged rank correlations ρ and τ ( averages are taken by the number of edges ) in case of n = 6 items and 0 . 15 perturbation . Figures 6 and 7 show the values belonging to the optimal graphs in case of ﬁxed edge numbers . One can see the monotone decreasing features of the Euclidean distances and the monotone increasing feature of the correlations , as expected . In the case of 4 objects , the weakest graph structure with 4 edges is better than the best graph structure with 3 edges . This is true for 4 and 5 edges , too . In the case of 22 Figure 3 : Standard deviations of the diﬀerent measures deﬁned by ( 46 ) , ( 47 ) , ( 48 ) , ( 49 ) , ( 50 ) and ( 51 ) in the case of diﬀerent graph structures comparing n = 4 objects and applying 0 . 15 perturbation . Figure 4 : Average EU _ M and EU _ W distances deﬁned by ( 46 ) and ( 47 ) in the function of the number of graphs’ edges . 23 Figure 5 : Average rank correlations Spearman ρ and Kendall τ ( deﬁned by ( 50 ) and ( 51 ) ) in the function of the number of graphs’ edges . 5 and 6 objects , although the best graphs with k edges are always weaker than the best graphs with k + 1 edges , nevertheless one can ﬁnd such cases when the best graph with k edges is better than the worst graph with k + 1 edges . We draw the attention that every measure indicates this observation , which is presented in Figure 8 for g 30 and g 49 . The same conclusion can be drawn for all perturbation values . This fact also supports that the reason resides in the structures of the graphs . Therefore it is worth planning the structure of the comparisons in order to gain the most information that is possible . Fixing a graph structure , let us investigate the similarity measures in the function of the perturbation . We can realize that increasing the perturbation , the distances get larger , while the correlations get smaller , as expected . The standard deviations of the similarity measures are also growing in all cases . Presenting the data belonging to the star - graph , Figures 9 , 10 , and 11 illustrate this ascertainment , too . The smallest number of comparisons , if the results can be evaluated , equals n − 1 , therefore it is specially interesting which comparison graph is worth using to get as much information as possible . According to the simulation results , the star - graphs are proved to be the best whatever similarity measure and perturbation were applied , independently 24 Figure 6 : Euclidean distances between the priority vectors belonging to the optimal graph structure with a given edge number and the complete graph ( deﬁned by ( 46 ) ) in the function of the number of graphs’ edges . Figure 7 : Pearson correlation coeﬃcients between the optimal graphs and the complete graph in the function of the number of graphs’ edges . 25 Figure 8 : An example in which less comparisons provide more information retrieval : the best graph with 7 edges and the worst with 8 edges ( n = 6 objects and 0 . 15 perturbation ) .

PE _ M and PE _ W are very close to each other . of the number of compared items . This result coincides with the observation published in ( Bozóki and Szádoczki , 2022 ) for the EM and LLSM methods , too . In the case of n = 6 objects and 0 . 15 perturbation , the correlation coeﬃcients are presented in Figure 12 . The ﬁrst ( blue ) columns belong to star - graph . It is clear that they are the highest . As in ( Orbán - Mihálykó et al . , 2019 ) were proved , the axiomatic properties of the Thur - stone motivated models are similar , independently of the distribution of the random vari - ables . As a robustness analysis , the simulations were also performed for the Thurstone model ( standard normal c . d . f . instead of logistic ( 6 ) ) allowing two options in decisions ( worse and better ) . Based on those , we can conclude that the observations stated in this section are all valid for this model , as well . Once again , this supports the ascertainment that the information retrieval depends on the structure of the comparisons’ graph and not on the model itself , and the method of the evaluation . The detailed data of the simulations are available in the online appendix at https : / / math . uni - pannon . hu / ~ orban . 27 Figure 11 : Dispersions of the similarity measures EU _ M , EU _ W , PE _ M , PE _ W , ρ and τ deﬁned by ( 46 ) , ( 47 ) , ( 48 ) , ( 49 ) , ( 50 ) and ( 51 ) , respectively , in the function of the perturbation values . 7 Conclusion In this paper , we have investigated some of the connections between the PCM - based de - cision making techniques and the stochastic models . One of the main contributions of the study is the deﬁnition and the deeper investigation of the consistency in case of the Bradley - Terry model , similarly to the concept used in AHP ( see Theorems 1 and 2 , and Deﬁnition 7 ) . The information retrieval of the diﬀerent graphs of comparisons has been examined for the case of the Bradley - Terry ( and the Thurstone ) model ( s ) with the help of many diﬀerent measurements . We have found that the measures almost always provide the same ranking of the diﬀerent structures of comparisons . For spanning trees the star - graph provided the most information ( comparing all possible comparison structures to the complete one ) . It is also true that the best graphs for a given number of objects to compare and a given number of comparisons were always the same as the ones found by ( Bozóki and Szádoczki , 2022 ) , which suggests that the optimality of these graphs is more general , it is not restricted to 28 Figure 12 : The correlation coeﬃcients between the results belonging to the diﬀerent graph structures having 5 edges and the complete case for 6 objects and 0 . 15 perturbation . the AHP model or the domain of PCMs . It can be an interesting research question for the future to investigate whether these graphs are optimal in case of other models , and what can be the ( analytical ) reasons behind this . Do the reasons originate of the comparisons’ structures ? In the current study , we have not labelled the diﬀerent objects . One could study the labelled structures of comparisons : what are the best graphs in those cases ? In particular , which star - graph is optimal , the one centered around the best , the worst or some other object ? In our view , it would be also important to continue the investigation of the connections between the AHP and the stochastic models , especially in connection with the properties of inconsistency and inconsistency indices .
