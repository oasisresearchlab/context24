These struc - tural changes are driven by changes in actin filament and micro - tubule dynamics and organisation . While most evidence suggests that the two cytoskeletal systems are remodelled in parallel during mitosis , recent work in interphase cells has implicated the centro - some in both microtubule and actin nucleation , suggesting the potential for regulatory crosstalk between the two systems . Here , by using both in vitro and in vivo assays to study centrosomal actin nucleation as cells pass through mitosis , we show that mitotic exit is accompanied by a burst in cytoplasmic actin filament formation that depends on WASH and the Arp 2 / 3 complex . This leads to the accumulation of actin around centrosomes as cells enter anaphase and to a corresponding reduction in the density of centrosomal microtubules . Taken together , these data suggest that the mitotic regulation of centrosomal WASH and the Arp 2 / 3 complex controls local actin nucleation , which may function to tune the levels of centrosomal microtubules during passage through mitosis .

These changes play a vital role in the control of animal cell division and begin as cells enter prophase . At this time , the inter - phase microtubule cytoskeleton is disassembled ( Centonze & Borisy , 1990 ; Niethammer et al , 2007 ; Mchedlishvili et al , 2018 ) , allowing microtubule nucleation to become focused at centrosomes ( Zhai et al , 1996 ; Piehl et al , 2004 ; Mchedlishvili et al , 2018 ) , where gamma - tubulin accumulates ( Khodjakov & Rieder , 1999 ; Bettencourt - Dias & Glover , 2007 ; Sulimenko et al , 2017 ) . With the loss of the nuclear / cytoplasmic compartment barrier at the onset of prometaphase , this is followed by a sudden change in micro - tubule organisation ( Mchedlishvili et al , 2018 ) and dynamics ( Zhai et al , 1996 ) . During prometaphase , the short , dynamic centrosomal microtubules that remain capture chromosomes ( Mitchison & Kirschner , 1985 ) drive bipolar spindle formation ( Magidson et al , 2011 ) and interact with the cortex to guide positioning of the mitotic spindle ( McNally , 2013 ) . The actin cytoskeleton also undergoes changes over the same period . These begin in prophase when the interphase actin cytoskeleton is disassembled ( Matthews et al , 2012 ) . This likely frees up a pool of actin monomers ( Kaur et al , 2014 ) , which is then used to assemble a thin ( Clark et al , 2013 ) , mechanically rigid ( Fischer - Friedrich et al , 2015 ) , cortical actomyosin network that drives mitotic rounding ( Reinsch & Karsenti , 1994 ; Ragkousi & Gibson , 2014 ; Sorce et al , 2015 ) . While the mechanisms underly - ing this mitotic switch in actin organisation are not well 1 MRC - LMCB , UCL , London , UK 2 IPLS , UCL , London , UK 3 IFOM , the FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology , University of Milan , Milan , Italy 4 University of Grenoble , Grenoble , France 5 Institute of Translational Medicine , Cellular and Molecular Physiology , University of Liverpool , Liverpool , UK 6 Department of Oncology and Hemato - Oncology , University of Milan , Milan , Italy 7 Hospital Saint - Louis , Paris , France * Corresponding author .

Interestingly , these parallel changes in actin and microtubule organisation appear to be largely independent of one another ( Mchedlishvili et al , 2018 ) . Thus , mitotic rounding is not much altered in cells entering mitosis without microtubules . Conversely , mitotic spindle assembly occurs with relatively normal kinetics in spherical cells that have been treated with latrunculin to remove their actomyosin cortex ( Lancaster et al , 2013 ) . Thus , during mitotic entry , the two systems appear to be independently regulated . However , this changes at anaphase , where the behaviour of the two filament systems is tightly coordinated for proper cell division . The signals emanating from the anaphase spindle polarises the overlying actomyosin cortex ( Rappaport , 1996 ) . This is achieved mainly through the activity of the centralspindlin complex ( White & Glotzer , 2012 ) , which binds overlapping microtubules at the midzone . This complex , in turn , recruits Ect2 ( Yu¨ce et al , 2005 ; Su et al , 2011 ) , leading to Rho activation and assembly of a contractile actomyosin ring ( Rappaport , 1996 ; Fededa & Gerlich , 2012 ) , which drives cytokinesis ( Wagner & Glotzer , 2016 ; Basant & Glotzer , 2018 ) . At the same time , as the anaphase spindle elongates , signals associated with the anaphase chromatin appear to aid relaxation of the polar cortical actomyosin network ( Salmon & Wolniak , 1990 ; Motegi et al , 2006 ; von Dassow , 2009 ; Ramkumar & Baum , 2016 ) . This leads to the de - phosphorylation of ERM proteins , which cross - link actin to the plasma membrane ( Rodrigues et al , 2015 ) , to the loss of anillin ( Kiyomitsu & Cheeseman , 2013 ) and to activation of SCAR / WAVE and the Arp2 / 3 complex at opposing cell poles ( Zhang & Robinson , 2005 ; King et al , 2010 ; Nezis et al , 2010 ; Bastos et al , 2012 ; Luo et al , 2014 ) . In some instances , the process of polar relax - ation and cell re - spreading is sufficient to drive division in cells that lack an actomyosin ring ( Neujahr et al , 1997 ; Dix et al , 2018 ) . In studies looking at the role of the actin cytoskeleton in division , the mitotic cortical actomyosin network has been subject to most scrutiny . This is because cortical cytoskeleton controls animal cell shape and is by far the brightest actin - based structure visible under the microscope . However , two groups have reported the existence of dynamic cytoplasmic actin - based structures in dividing HeLa cells ( Mitsushima et al , 2010 ; Field & Le´na´rt , 2011 ; Fink et al , 2011 ) . While the precise function of this pool of cytoplasmic actin remains unclear , it has been reported to play a role in spindle assembly and positioning in various systems ( Woolner et al , 2008 ; Sabino et al , 2015 ) . In addition , cytoplasmic actin appears to work together with an unconventional Myosin , Myo19 , to aid the partitioning of mito - chondria at anaphase ( Rohn et al , 2014 ) . Here , building on a previous study that identified the WASH / Arp2 / 3 - dependent nucleation of actin at centrosomes in interphase cells ( Farina et al , 2016 ) , we have re - examined the dynamics and potential function of non - cortical actin at mitotic exit . Using a combination of cell biology and biochemistry , we report the identifi - cation of a pool of WASH / Arp2 / 3 - dependent cytoplasmic actin that is nucleated around centrosomes in early anaphase , which appears to limit the nucleation of centrosomal microtubules . Results In order to explore the possibility that actin is nucleated at centro - somes during mitotic exit , as it is in interphase cells ( Farina et al , 2016 ) , we fixed a population of HeLa cells and examined the amount of F - actin ( phalloidin ) and microtubules in a region close to centrosomes at different cell cycle stages . This revealed an increase in the density of F - actin in a small region around the centrosomes during the passage from metaphase to early anaphase ( Fig 1A and B ) . During this period , we observed no significant changes in the levels of non - centrosomal cytoplasmic actin ( Fig EV1A and C ) . This increase in centrosomally associated actin was accompanied by a decrease in microtubules intensity in the same region ( Figs 1A and EV1B ) . A similar increase in actin accumulation and a correspond - ing decrease in tubulin intensity were also observed around the centrosomes of early anaphase Jurkat cells , a T - lymphocyte cell line ( Fig EV1E and F ) . To investigate the dynamics of actin during this period , we used a spinning disc confocal to image HeLa cells expressing Lifeact - GFP . We observed a dynamic pool of cytoplasmic actin in metaphase , as described previously ( Mitsushima et al , 2010 ; Fink et al , 2011 ) . At anaphase , this pool became concentrated sub - cortically around the opposing poles ( Figs 1C and EV2 , Movies EV1 – EV3 ) . In order to define the dynamics of actin accumulation around the centrosomes , we generated a stable HeLa cell line expressing RFP - Lifeact and GFP - tubulin and performed relatively high temporal resolution acquisition ( Fig 1D ) . Shortly after anaphase onset , we observed an increase in the levels of actin around centrosomes ( Fig 1D – F ) , while non - centrosomal cytoplasmic actin levels remained unchanged ( Fig EV1A and D ) . This burst of actin filament formation was extremely transient , occurring within minutes of anaphase onset , and was over by the time the cytokinetic furrow became clearly visible ( Figs 1C – F and EV2 , Movies EV1 – EV3 ) . Further , we observed this transient accumulation of actin around centrosomes during anaphase using diverse actin reporters ( siR - actin , Lifeact - GFP and RFP - Lifeact ) , albeit with different accu - mulation dynamics that we attribute to the nature of the probes and their differing actin - binding kinetics ( Figs 1 and EV2 ) . During the same period , the density of microtubules , measured as an integrated intensity in a small region around spindle poles , dropped ( Fig 1D and G ) . Thus , this transient appearance of cytoplasmic actin close to centrosomes at mitotic exit is associated with a reduction in the density of centrosomal microtubules . In order to better visualise centrosomal actin in vivo , and as a method by which to isolate centrosomes for the in vitro experiments ( see below ) , we also carried out similar analysis during monopolar cytokinesis ( Hu et al , 2008 ) . For these experiments , we arrested HeLa cells in prometaphase using STLC ( Mayer et al , 1999 ; DeBonis et al , 2004 ) — a treatment that inhibits the Eg5 motor to prevent the assembly of a bipolar spindle ( Fig 2 ) . Actin nucleation was then followed as these prometaphase - arrested cells were forced to exit mitosis through the addition of a Cdk1 inhibitor ( RO - 3306 ) ( Hu et al , 2008 ) . Importantly , under these conditions , the analysis of centrosomal actin is facilitated by the fact that the monopole contains both centrosomes and remains far from the cell cortex ( Fig 2A ) — even though many other aspects of cytokinesis appear similar ( Karayel et al , 2018 ) . In this experiment , we observed little centrosomal - associated actin in the cells arrested in prometaphase with STLC ( Figs 2A and EV3 , Movie EV4 ) . However , within ~ 6 min 2 of 16 The EMBO Journal 38 : e 99843 | 2019 ª 2019 The Authors The EMBO Journal Francesca Farina et al A C D E F G B Figure 1 . ª 2019 The Authors The EMBO Journal 38 : e 99843 | 2019 3 of 16 Francesca Farina et al The EMBO Journal of Cdk1 inhibitor addition we observed a burst of actin filament formation close to centrosomes ( Figs 2A and EV3 , Movie EV4 ) . Strikingly , these actin filaments formed parallel bundles that lay in between the astral microtubules emanating from the large monopole present in these cells ( Fig 2A and B ) . To confirm this finding , cells arrested in prometaphase and cells after forced exit were fixed and stained to visualise actin filaments ( phalloidin ) . We observed a similar increase in actin around centrosomes during forced exit in multiple cell lines : in HeLa cells ( Fig 2C – E ) , the Jurkat T - cell line ( Fig EV4A and B ) and the MAVER1 B - cell line ( Fig EV4C and D ) . Further , this actin accumulation was accompanied by a reduction in the density of centrosomal microtubules ( Fig 2E ) . Thus , cytoplasmic actin appears to transiently accumulate around centrosomes during mitotic exit in both monopolar and bipolar divisions , and this is accompanied by a local decrease in microtubule density . Previous work demonstrated that the actin formed at interphase centrosomes is nucleated by a local pool of Arp2 / 3 ( Farina et al , 2016 ) . To investigate the role of Arp2 / 3 complex in actin accumula - tion during mitotic exit , we treated cells with either DMSO or the Arp2 / 3 complex inhibitor , CK666 , and determined the amount of centrosomal actin in fixed ( Fig 3 ) and live cells ( Fig EV5 ) . While the DMSO control behaved as described above , the CK666 Arp2 / 3 inhi - bitor was effective in eliminating the formation of cytoplasmic actin , including the actin emanating from the centrosome ( Fig 3A – D ) . This was the case in both regular bipolar mitosis ( Fig 3A and B ) , forced monopolar exit ( Fig 3C and D ) and live monopolar exit ( Fig EV5A and B ) . While the actin accumulation decreased in cells treated with the Arp2 / 3 inhibitor , interestingly we found that Arp2 / 3 inhibition prevented the reduction in the density of microtubules associated with centrosomes during normal mitotic exit ( Figs 3E and EV6A ) and in monopolar exit ( fixed cells – Figs 3F and 6B ; live cells — EV5C ) . This suggests that the pool of actin associated with the centrosomes may influence centrosomal microtubules in early anaphase . This could aid division , as we observed a small percent - age of cells with spindle oscillations ( data not shown ) . These results indicate the role of Arp2 / 3 in generating the burst of cytoplasmic actin associated with centrosomes at mitotic exit . To determine the localisation dynamics of Arp2 / 3 during mitotic progression , we fixed and stained cells using an antibody against a component of the complex , p34 ( Fig 4A ) . This revealed a pool of Arp2 / 3 at the centrosome , marked by centrin 1 ( Fig 4A and B ) that was very low to undetectable in metaphase , but increased signifi - cantly in intensity as cells were forced to leave mitosis ( Fig 4A and B ) . A similar increase in the level of centrosomal Arp2 / 3 was also observed when we analysed the association of p34 with centro - somes purified from cells before and shortly after forced mitotic exit ( Fig 4C and D ) . Additionally , we observed a pool of Arp2 colo - calised with centrin at the centre of centrosomes , which was signifi - cantly higher during anaphase ( Fig EV7A and B 0 ) . These data identify a pool of Arp2 / 3 that is recruited to centrosomes soon after the onset of anaphase , where it functions to nucleate the formation of local actin filaments . To validate these findings and to determine whether centrosomes might be a potential source of the cytoplasmic pool of actin formed at anaphase , we performed biochemical experiments on centro - somes isolated from cells arrested in prometaphase and those ▸ Figure 2 .

While centrosomes isolated from prometaphase cells failed to nucleate significant levels of actin , centrosomes isolated from cells shortly after forced exit from mitosis nucleated large actin asters ( Fig 4E and F ) . Significantly , the in vitro growth of these actin asters could be inhibited by the addition of capping protein ( Fig 4G and H ) , which caps the growing plus ends of filaments ( Pollard & Borisy , 2003 ) , as expected if they were formed as the result of active Arp2 / 3 localised at the centrosome . Further , when we washed - out capping protein and switched the colour of the labelled monomeric actin in the solution , we were able to show that this actin was nucleated at the centre of the aster at the centrosome ( yellow dot in Fig 4G ) . Finally , we used CK666 to confirm that the formation of these actin asters was dependent on Arp2 / 3 complex activity ( Fig 4I and J ) , as it was in cells exiting mitosis . Next , we turned to WASH to determine whether this anaphase pool of centrosomal actin filament formation depends on the WASH complex , as was previously described for interphase cells ( Farina et al , 2016 ) . To begin , we used western blotting to follow WASH1 in interphase cells , mitotic cells or cells following forced mitotic exit ( Fig 5A and B ) . This revealed a clear CDK1 - dependent band shift , in line with the idea that WASH is modified by phosphorylation ( Olsen et al , 2010 ) . In addition , we were able to see a shift in the size of the WASH1 complex on a native gel , during monopolar cytokinesis , suggesting the possibility that there are larger changes in the WASH complex at the transition between metaphase and anaphase ( Fig 5B ) . Finally , we observed a slight elevation of WASH1 signal around centrosomes when we imaged WASH1 localisation in prometaphase - arrested cells and in cells forced to exit mitosis ( Fig EV7C ) . To test whether WASH complex plays a function in generating the burst of centrosomal actin filament formation at anaphase , we performed WASH1 RNAi ( confirmed by Western blot Fig 6C ) . For this experiment , WASH1 RNAi cells were arrested in STLC and then released ( Fig 6A and B ) to avoid the impact of WASH RNAi on mitotic entry . When the levels of centrosomal actin were analysed in WASH RNAi cells as they exited mitosis , we observed a near complete loss of centrosomal actin in cells exiting mitosis , both in live ( Fig 6A and B ) and in fixed samples ( Fig 6D and E ) . Moreover , we observed a similar loss in the ability of centrosomes to nucleate actin asters when we pre - treated purified centrosomes with anti - WASH1 antibody ( Fig 6F and G ) . Thus , both in vivo and in vitro , ◀ Figure 3 . Arp 2 / 3 - dependent actin accumulation at the centrosome .

Discussion This paper identifies a role for Arp2 / 3 and its upstream activator , WASH complex , in the nucleation of actin filaments from centro - somes at mitotic exit . While it has long been clear that the spindle directs the assembly of a contractile actomyosin ring at anaphase , and that actin and microtubules work together to control cell shape and organisation ( Huber et al , 2015 ) , there has been little evidence of crosstalk between the two filament systems occurring in the opposite direction during mitosis . The data presented here , along with data in studies carried out in lymphocytes in interphase ( Inoue et al , 2019 ) and in Xenopus egg extracts in vitro ( Colin et al , 2018 ) , suggest that actin may also play a role in tuning microtubule nucle - ation at the centrosome . A E G H I J F B C D Figure 4 . 8 of 16 The EMBO Journal 38 : e 99843 | 2019 ª 2019 The Authors The EMBO Journal Francesca Farina et al There are many ways in which the microtubule network can be influenced by actin filaments ( Rodriguez et al , 2003 ; Coles & Bradke , 2015 ; Huber et al , 2015 ; Colin et al , 2018 ) . Actin can direct the growth and alignment of microtubules ( Kaverina et al , 1998 ; Thery et al , 2006 ; Lo ´ pez et al , 2014 ; Elie et al , 2015 ) , can change MT dynamics ( Zhou et al , 2002 ; Hutchins & Wray , 2014 ) and can subject MTs to mechanical forces and physical constraints ( Gupton et al , 2002 ; Brangwynne et al , 2006 ; Fakhri et al , 2014 ; Huber et al , 2015 ; Robison et al , 2016 ; Katrukha et al , 2017 ; Colin et al , 2018 ) . These interactions occur along the length of microtubules and at their growing plus ends ( Akhmanova & Steinmetz , 2015 ; Mohan & John , 2015 ) , and are especially prevalent at the cell periphery ( Waterman - Storer & Salmon , 1997 ; Wittmann et al , 2003 ) , where the two filament systems converge in a crowded space . The presence of actin at the centrosome ( Farina et al , 2016 ) now provides an additional spatial region where the two filaments systems can interact to regulate one another’s behaviour . Here , we show that centrosomal actin is generated through the local recruit - ment and utilisation of the Arp2 / 3 complex during anaphase . This is likely to be regulated by the change in Cdk1 activity at mitotic exit . The anaphase burst of centrosomal actin is also dependent on the activity of the WASH complex . The timing of centrosomal actin nucleation correlates with the shift in the WASH1 band ( Fig 5A and B ) , suggesting that this process might be regulated by the change in mitotic kinases and phosphatases activity at mitotic exit . This could be augmented by the mitotic regulation of Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figs 4A – D , EV7A and B ) . The precise nature of the activation of these complexes and their crosstalk remains to be determined . Like Arp2 / 3 on a bead , bacterium or patch ( Pollard et al , 2000 ; Pollard & Borisy , 2003 ; Reymann et al , 2011 ) , the local activation of Arp2 / 3 is expected to generate actin filaments that have their minus ends fixed in place , while their plus ends grow out into the cyto - plasm ( Figs 1 – 4 and EV1 – EV3 ) . This is in keeping with the fact that the extension of these asters can be capped by capping protein ( Fig 4G ) . However , in cells exiting mitosis normally ( Figs 1C and D , and EV2 , Movies EV1 – EV3 ) , centrosomes also appear to nucleate a much more diffuse cytoplasmic pool of actin . This may result from Arp2 / 3 - dependent branching of centrosomally nucleated filaments in the cytoplasm of anaphase cells . Together , this pool of cytoplas - mic WASH - Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin may have an impact on the viscosity of the cytoplasm ( Moulding et al , 2012 ) , as has been shown in meiotic cells ( Chaigne et al , 2016 ) . Cytoplasmic actin could act in this manner , to limit the movement of separated orga - nelles after the disassembly of the anaphase spindle — as has been shown for mitochondria ( Rohn et al , 2014 ) . Previous studies have suggested mitotic roles for cytoplasmic actin in centrosome separation ( Rosenblatt et al , 2004 ; Cao et al , 2010 ) , pole splitting ( Sabino et al , 2015 ) and spindle assembly ( Woolner et al , 2008 ; Po’uha & Kavallaris , 2015 ; Vilmos et al , A B Figure 5 .

Our data suggest that the capacity for the generation of centrosomal actin in metaphase is limited . Moreover , in HeLa cells , where this cytoplasmic actin was first observed ( Mitsushima et al , 2010 ; Fink et al , 2011 ) , Arp2 / 3 complex activity has little influence on the timing of mitotic progression ( Lancaster et al , 2013 ) and contributes little to metaphase cortical mechanics ( Chugh et al , 2017 ) . However , our data support the idea that cytoplasmic actin has a significant function at the onset of anaphase ( including in the control of mitochondrial movement ( Rohn et al , 2014 ) ) , when CDK1 - mediated phosphorylation of WASH is relieved and active Arp2 / 3 returns to the centrosome to induce a burst of actin . This burst in centrosomal actin is accompanied by a reduction in the microtubule density around the centrosomes at early anaphase . In the absence of centrosomal actin nucleation , with Arp2 / 3 inhi - bitor , this reduction in microtubule density is inhibited . This suggests an antagonistic crosstalk between the two filament systems at mitotic exit . The precise nature of this antagonism between local actin and microtubule formation at the centrosome remains to be determined ( Piel et al , 2001 ; Obino et al , 2016 ; Inoue et al , 2019 ) . We speculate that this burst of anaphase actin nucleation at centro - somes may cause steric problems , as the two systems compete for physical space around the centrosome . However , in live cells , we cannot rule out the possibility of an indirect crosstalk mediated by either changes in localisation or activity of proteins affecting post - translational modifications of tubulin during mitotic exit ( Shi et al , 2019 ) . Further , it is possible that the centrosomal actin pool could have a more profound effect depending on the nature of micro - tubules , i . e . astral vs spindle microtubules at mitotic exit . The actin dependent reduction in microtubule density around centrosomes may help cells leaving mitosis to re - establish a telophase array of sparse , long centrosomal microtubules . These microtubules canthenspantheentirespaceofthecells , assistingin polarrelaxation , adjusting spindle orientation ( Kiyomitsu & Cheeseman , 2013 ) and / or promoting re - spreading ( Ferreira et al , 2013 ) . In short , this reduction in microtubule density at early anaphase could assist cells exiting mitosisto returntotheir interphaseorganisationandmorphology . Materials and Methods Cell culture HeLa Kyoto cells were cultured in DMEM , and Jurkat cells ( immor - talised human T lymphocytes ) as well as MAVER1 CML B cells in RPMI 1640 ( Gibco ) at 37 ° C and 5 % CO 2 . All media were supple - mented with 10 % foetal bovine serum and penicillin / streptomycin ( Gibco ) . Cells were synchronised in prometaphase using S - trityl - L - cysteine ( STLC ; Sigma ) at 5 l M treatment for 18 h ( Skoufias et al , 2006 ) . Forced mitotic exit was performed by the addition of 20 l M RO - 3306 ( Enzo Life Sciences ) , an inhibitor of Cdk1 / cyclin B1 and Cdk1 / cyclin A to STLC - treated cells . For the Arp2 / 3 complex inhibi - tion experiments , we used 0 . 2 mM CK666 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Control experiments were performed using DMSO . For CK666 treatment ( Fig 3 ) , cells were plated with 2 mM thymidine for 22 h , were released from thymidine block for 9 h , following which they were treated with DMSO or 0 . 2 mM CK666 for 15 min . They were then processed for staining . Actin network disruption was performed by adding 10 l g / ml cytochalasin D ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Microtubule depolymerisation was performed by adding 1 l M nocodazole ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 1 h at 37 ° C and 5 % CO 2 and for 30 min at 4 ° C . Stable and transient cell transfection Stable HeLa cell lines expressing GFP - a - tubulin and RFP - Lifeact were established starting from HeLa stably expressing GFP - a - tubulin by lentiviral transduction with rLV - Lifeact - RFP ( Ibidi ) using 3 MOI ( multi - plicity of infection ) . After 24 h , cells were incubated with fresh medium for 48 h . After 72 h post - transduction , stable cells were selected using 1 l g / ml puromycin . Medium with puromycin was replaced every 2 – 3 days until resistant colonies were identified . ON - TARGETplus Human SMARTpool WASH1 - targeting ( siWASH1 ) siRNAs ( Dharmacon , GE Healthcare ) were transfected into HeLa cells at a final concentration of 20 nM using Lipofectamine RNAiMax ( Life Technologies ) according to supplier’s protocol . Negative control siRNA was performed using AllStars Negative Control siRNA ( Qiagen ) . Isolation of centrosomes Centrosomes were isolated from cells arrested in prometaphase ( STLC ) or shortly after their forced mitotic exit ( RO - 3306 5 0 ) using a previously published protocol ( Farina et al , 2016 ) . Cells were incu - bated for 18 h with STLC and then treated with nocodazole ( 0 . 2 l M ) and cytochalasin D ( 1 l g / ml ) . For the mitotic exit , we added to STLC - treated cells 20 l M RO - 3306 for 5 min , and cells were kept on ice for 30 min . Centrosomes were then harvested by centrifugation onto a 60 % sucrose cushion and further purified by centrifugation through a discontinuous ( 70 , 50 and 40 % ) sucrose gradient . Composition of sucrose solutions was based on TicTac buffer ( 10 mM Hepes , 16 mM Pipes ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 50 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA ) .
