Molecular Characterization of CDC42 , a Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gene Involved in the Development of Cell Polarity Douglas I . Johnson and John R . Pringle Department of Biology , The University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 Abstract . The Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC42 gene product is involved in the morphogenetic events of the cell division cycle ; temperature - sensitive cdc42 mu - tants are unable to form buds and display delocalized cell - surface deposition at the restrictive temperature ( Adams , A . E . M . , D . I . Johnson , R . M . Longnecker , B . E Sloat , and J . R . Pringle . 1990 . J . Cell Biol . 111 : 131 - 142 ) . To begin a molecular analysis of CDC42 function , we have isolated the CDC42 gene from a yeast genomic DNA library . The use of the cloned DNA to create a deletion of CDC42 confirmed that the gene is essential . Overexpression of CDC42 under control of the GALIO promoter was not grossly deleterious to cell growth but did perturb the normal pattern of selection of budding sites . Determination of the DNA and predicted amino acid sequences of CDC42 revealed a high degree of similarity in amino acid sequence to the ras and rho ( Madaule , P . , R . Axel , and A . M . Myers . 1987 . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . 84 : 779 - 783 ) families of gene products . The similarities to ras proteins ( , , ~ 40 % identical or related amino acids overall ) were most pronounced in the regions that have been implicated in GTP binding and hydrolysis and in the COOH - terminal modifications leading to membrane association , suggesting that CDC42 function also involves these biochemical prop - erties . The similarities to the rho proteins ( ~ 60 % identical or related amino acids overall ) were more widely distributed through the coding region , suggest - ing more extensive similarities in as yet undefined bio - chemical properties and functions . T rIE Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC24 , CDC42 , and CDC43 gene products play critical roles in the estab - lishment of cell polarity , the localization of secretion and cell - surface deposition , and the development of normal cell shape ( Hartwell et al . , 1974 ; Sloat and Pringle , 1978 ; Field and Schekman , 1980 ; Sloat et al . , 1981 ; Pringle and Hartwell , 1981 ; Pringle et al . , 1986 ; Adams et al . , 1990 ) . Yeast strains carrying temperature - sensitive lethal mutations in these genes have essentially identical morphological phenotypes . At permissive temperatures , the mutants grow and bud normally ; at restrictive temperatures , the nuclear cycle continues but bud formation is blocked . Cell mass and volume continue to increase , resulting in greatly enlarged , unbudded cells . The cytoplasmic actin network appears dis - organized ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ; Adams et al . , 1990 ) , and chitin and other cell surface materials appear to be de - posited randomly or uniformly throughout the enlarging cell walls , in contrast to their normal highly localized patterns of deposition . In addition , some temperature - sensitive cdc24 mutants show abnormal positioning of budding sites when grown at permissive temperatures , suggesting that the CDC24 gene product is involved in the initial selection and organization of the budding site ( Sloat et al . , 1981 ) . Another cdc24 mutant was identified among a collection of calcium - D . I . Johnson ' s present address is Department of Microbiology and Molecu - lar Genetics , University of Vermont , Burlington , VT 05405 . sensitive mutants , suggesting a possible interaction of the gene product with calcium ( Ohya et al . , 1986a , b ) . The CDC24 gene has been cloned ( Coleman et al . , 1986 ; Ohya et al . , 1986a ) and sequenced ( Miyamoto et al . , 1987 ) . The predicted gene product contains two putative Ca2 + - binding domains . As a step in the further analysis of this system , we have begun a molecular characterization of the CDC42 gene and its product . We report here the isolation and sequence analy - sis of CDC42 , as well as the phenotypes associated with its deletion or overexpression . Remarkably , the predicted amino acid sequence of the CDC42 product is strikingly similar to the ras ( Capon et al . , 1983 ; Powers et al . , 1984 ; Tatchell , 1986 ) and rho ( Madaule and Axel , 1985 ; Madaule et al . , 1987 ; Anderson and Lacal , 1987 ) families of gene products from yeast and larger eukaryotes .

The permissive and restrictive temperatures for growth of temperature - sensitive mutants were 23 and 36°C , respectively . Esche - richia coli strain I - IBI01 was routinely used as a plasmid host . The S . cere - visiae strains used were C276 , MATa / MAT ~ gal2 / gal2 prototrophic , and C276 - 4A , MATa gal2 prototrophic ( Wilkinson and Pringle , 1974 ) ; JPT163BD5 - 5C , MATv ~ cdc42 - 1 gal2 ( Adams et al . , 1990 ; Adams , A . , and J .

Plasmids pBR322 , YEp24 , YRp7 , YIpS , and YEp51 have been described elsewhere ( Maniatis et al . , 1982 ; Botstein et ai . , 1979 ; Broach et al . , 1983 ) . The yeast - E , coil shuttle plasmid YEpl03 contains the URA3 selectable yeast marker and the 2 - # plasmid origin of replication ( Lillie , S . , and J . R . Pringie , unpublished results ) . The yeast genomic DNA library in plasmid YEp24 ( provided by D . Botstein , Genentech , South San Francisco , CA ) contains fragments produced by partial Sau 3A digestion of DNA from S . cerevisiae strain DBY939 ( Carlson and Botstein , 1982 ) . DNA and RNA Manipulations Standard procedures were used for recombinant DNA manipulations ( Maniatis et al . , 1982 ) , E . coli and yeast transformations ( Maniatis et al . , 1982 ; Hinnen et al . , 1978 ) , plasmid isolation from E . coli ( Birnboim and Doly , 1979 ) and yeast ( Sherman et al . , 1986 ) , and nick translations using 32p - dATP ( Maniatis et al . , 1982 ) . Total yeast DNA was isolated essentially as described previously ( Bloom and Carbon , 1982 ) . Total RNA was pre - pared from strain C276 - 4A growing exponentially in the rich , glucose - con - taming medium YM - P ( LiUie and Pringle , 1980 ) essentially as described by Maccecchini et al . ( 1979 ) . Poly ( A ) - containing RNA was then isolated by chromatography on poly ( U ) - Sephadex ( Bethesda Research Laborato - ries , Gaithersburg , MD ) , following the manufacturer ' s instructions . DNA and RNA blot hybridizations were performed essentially as described previ - ously ( Maniatis et al . , 1982 ; Thomas , 1980 ) , using 1 % agarose gels and nitrocellulose paper . The DNA - DNA hybridizations were performed at 65°C for , , o16 h in a solution containing 5 × SSC salts ( Maniatis et al . , 1982 ) and 1 % sarkosyl . The RNA - DNA hybridizations were performed at 42°C for " , , 16 h in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7 , containing 5× SSC salts , 250 # g / ml calf thymus DNA , 0 . 02 % bovine serum albumin , 0 . 02 % FicoU 400 , 0 . 02 % polyvinylpyrollidone , and 50 % formamide . MI 3 dideoxy sequencing ( Sanger et al . , 1977 ) was performed essentially as described in the Bethesda Research Laboratories M13 sequencing man - ual , using 35S - dATP and the vectors M13mp8 , M13mplS , and M13mpl9 . Exonuclease III generation of M13 deletion derivatives used in dideoxy - sequencing reactions was performed using a modification ( Beltzer et al . , 1986 ) of the procedure of Henikoff ( 1984 ) . The mutagenic oligonucleotide GAGACCCTAGTCATAT ( the underlined A is T in the wild - type sequence ) and certain sequencing primers were provided by The University of Michi - gan Center for Molecular Genetics Oligonucleotide Synthesis Facility ( Ann Arbor , MI ) . Site - directed mutagenesis ( Kunkel , 1985 ) was performed using the MUTA - GENE TM kit from Bio - Rad Laboratories ( Richmond , CA ) , fol - lowing the supplier ' s instructions . The mTn3 ( URA3 ) minitransposon ( Seifert et al . , 1986 ) was used for in - sertional inactivation of the CDC42 gene . The Sea I - Xba I fragment from pBR ( 42 ) l ( see Results ) and a fragment from YEp24 containing the 2 - # plas - mid origin of replication were inserted by standard procedures into plasmid pHSS6 ( Seifert et al . , 1986 ) to generate plasmid pHSS6 ( 42 ) l . After co - transformation of pHSS6 ( 42 ) l and a mTn3 ( URA3 ) transposon - containing plasmid into the appropriate E . coli strain ( Seifert et al . , 1986 ) , cells that contained a mTn3 ( URA3 ) transposon inserted into pHSS6 ( 42 ) 1 were selected . The locations and orientations of the insertions were then deter - mined relative to the Xho I and Pvu I sites of pHSS6 ( 42 ) l by restriction - enzyme analysis ( see Results ) .

YRp ( 42 ) l was con - structed by inserting the 1 . 1 - kb TRP1 / ARSI Eco RI fragment from YRp7 into the Eco RI site of pBR ( 42 ) l . YRp ( 42 ) 2 was constructed by deleting a 3 . 3 - kb Ava I fragment from pBR ( 42 ) l ( using a site in the vector ) and then inserting the TRP1 / ARS1 fragment as just de - scribed , pBR ( 42 ) 3 was constructed from pBR ( 42 ) l by deleting DNA to the left of the Sea I site and to the right of the Nde I site using restriction sites within the vector . YRp ( 42 ) 3 was constructed by inserting the TRP1 / ARSI fragment into pBR ( 42 ) 3 as just described .

Amino acid sequence similarities were determined using the Microgenie TM sequence - analysis programs ( Beckman Instruments , Inc . , Fullerton , CA ) . Visualization of Chitin Rings Plasmid - containing yeast cells were grown under conditions selective for the plasmid , with 2 % glucose or 2 % galactose as the sole carbon source . Chitin rings were visualized by fluorescence microscopy after staining cells in 0 . 1 % Calcofluor for 3 rain and washing in distilled water ( Sloat and Prin - gle , 1978 ) . Results Isolation and Identification of CDC42 Plasmids that complemented the temperature - sensitive cdc42ol mutation in strain DJTD2 - 16D were isolated from a yeast genomic - DNA library in the URA3 - containing plas - mid YEp24 . 24 primary Ura + Ts + transformants were ob - tained . From each transformant , a plasmid was recovered into E . coli that could retransform DJTD2 - 16D to Ura + Ts + . The Ura + and " Is + phenotypes of these transformants cosegregated after growth on nonselective media ( data not shown ) , indicating that the complementation of cdc42 - 1 was due to the autonomously replicating recombinant plasrnids . Restriction enzyme analyses and DNA - DNA blot hybridiza - tion experiments ( data not shown ) indicated that all 24 plas - mids contained overlapping regions of DNA . Several repre - sentative plasmids that were examined in more detail shared a common 2 . 7 - kb region of DNA ( Fig . 1 A ) . DNA - DNA blot hybridization experiments using total yeast DNA and a probe derived from one of these plasmids revealed only the fragments expected if the cloned DNA was derived without rearrangement from contiguous chromosomal DNA that was single copy in the haploid genome ( Fig . 2 A , lanes 1 - 5 ) . The observation that all 24 complementing plasmids con - tained overlapping DNA inserts suggested that the CDC42 Figure 2 . ( A and B ) DNA - DNA blot hybridization analyses of chromosomal DNA from parental and transformed strains . After digestion with the indicated restriction enzymes , DNA fragments were separated and hybridized to radioactively labeled pBR ( 42 ) l as described in Materials and Methods . The sizes of the fragments visualized are indicated in kilobase pairs . ( A ) Total DNA from strain TD4 ( lanes 1 - 5 ) and from the same strain after integration of a plasmid containing cdc42 - complementing sequences and the URA3 gene ( see text ; lane 6 ) was digested with Eco RI ( lane I ) , Eco RI + Xba I ( lane 2 ) , Eco RI + Pvu I ( lane 3 ) , Eco RI + Xho I ( lane 4 ) , or Eco RI + Barn HI ( lanes 5 and 6 ) . As the integrated vector sequence contains a single Bam HI site , the replacement of the original 4 . 3 - kb F _ , co RI fragment ( lane 5 ) by two new Eco RI / Bam HI fragments in the transformant ( lane 6 ) indicates that the integration had occurred at the chromosomal site homologous to the cdc42 - complemendng DNA . ( B ) Total DNA from strain DJID7 - 1 ( lanes 1 and 2 ) and from the same strain after integration of a fragment in which cdc42 - complementing DNA had been replaced by URA3 ( see text ; lanes 3 and 4 ) was digested with Eco RI ( lanes I and 3 ) or Eco RI + Xba I ( lanes 2 and 4 ) . The URA3 fragment used contained an Eco RI site immediately adjacent to the Spe I site used in the cloning . Thus , integration of the hybrid fragment at the chromosomal site homologous to the cdc42 - complementing DNA would result in the loss of the chromosomal Xba I site but the addition of a new Eco RI site at nearly the same location . Therefore , digestion of DNA from the transformant with Eco RI should yield two new fragments of about the same sizes as those generated by an Eco RI + Xba I digestion of the parental DNA , together with the original 4 . 3 - kb Eco RI fragment ( from the chromosome not involved in the integration event ) . Digestion of DNA from the transformant with Eco RI + Xba I should yield doublet bands at the positions of the two new bands in the Eco RI digest . The results shown conform to these predictions . ( C ) Analyses of mRNA transcripts encoded by the cdc42 - complementing region . Poly ( A ) + - RNA from strain C276 ( 20 ~ g / lane in lanes 1 and 2 ; 10 tzg / lane in lanes 3 and 4 ) was separated and hybridized to radioactive probes as described in Materials and Methods . The probe for lanes I and 2 was pBR ( 42 ) 3 ; autoradiography was for 9 . 5 ( lane 1 ) and 140 h ( lane 2 ) . The probes for lanes 3 and 4 were single - strand DNAs prepared by primer extension in the presence of 32P - dATP on templates of M13mpl8 ( lane 3 ) and M13mpl9 ( lane 4 ) into which the cdc42 - complementing Sca I - Xba I fragment had been cloned using the Sma I and Xba I sites of the vectors .

Nucleotide sequence of the CDC42 region and pre - dicted amino acid sequence of the CDC42 product . The CDC42 open reading frame was identified as described in the text . The nucleotide se - quence is numbered relative to the A of the putative initia - tor codon . The Xho I , Hpa I , and Pvu I sites ( underlined ) are located at positions - 525 to - 520 , - 67 to - 62 , and + 192 to + 197 , respectively . The TTG L ~ " codon altered by site directed mutagenesis is boxed . Multiple inframe stop codons ( . . . ) are present with - in the 40 - bp 5 ' to the putative initiator ATG and within the 30 - bp 3 ' to the putative termi - nation codon . Possible TATA promoter sequences ( broken underlines ) are present at po - sitions - 112 to - 107 and - 96 to - 91 . In addition , a 17 - bp stretch of poly ( dA - dT ) is pres - ent at position - 5 I0 to - 494 . Similar stretches of poly ( dA - dT ) have been implicated in the constitutive expression of certain promoters ( Struhl , 1986 ) . These sequence data are available from EMBL / Gen - Bank / DDBJ under accession number X51906 . gene itself , rather than a plasmid borne suppressor , had been cloned . This hypothesis was supported by the observations that CDC42 maps to chromosome XII and that the cloned DNA hybridized to the chromosome XII band after or - thogonal field alternation gel electrophoresis ( Johnson et al . , 1987 ) . To test further the identity of the cloned DNA , we in - tegrated a plasmid containing cdc42 - complementing se - quences and the yeast selectable marker URA3 into a CDC42 ÷ yeast strain and then determined the meiotic link - age between the integrated URA3 gene and a cdc42 muta - tion . The 2 . 5 - kb Xho I - Sal I fragment from plasmid pBR ( 42 ) l was inserted into the Sal I site of the URA3 - containing plasmid YIp5 ( which cannot replicate autono - mously in yeast ) . The resulting plasmid was linearized within the insert at the unique Xba I site and transformed into strain TIM , selecting for Ura ÷ . Two stable Ura ÷ transfor - mants were shown by DNA - DNA blot hybridization to have the plasmid integrated at the chromosomal site homologous to the cdc42 - complementing DNA ( Fig . 2 A , lanes 5 and 6 ) . These transformants were crossed to the cdc42 - 1 strain DJMD2 - 7C . 80 of 84 four - spore tetrads were parental di - types ( 2 Ura ÷ Ts + : 2 Ura - Ts - ) ; the remaining four tetrads segregated 3 Ts÷ : 1 Ts - . Thus , integration had indeed oc - curred at the CDC42 locus . The recessive , temperature - sensitive lethal phenotype of the cdc42 - 1 mutation suggests that the CDC42 gene product is essential for vegetative growth . To test this conclusion and complete the identification of the cloned DNA , we generated a deletion mutation by replacing the cdc42 - complementing region with the URA3 gene . The DNA between the unique Hpa I and Xba I sites in plasmid pBR ( 42 ) l ( Fig . 1 A ) was replaced with the URA3 - containing Sma I - Spe I fragment from YEp24 . A 2 . 5 - kb Xho I - Spe I fragment , which con - tained the URA3 gene flanked on both sides by DNA from the cdc42 - complementing region , was excised from the re - suiting plasmid and used to transform the CDC42 / cdc42 het - erozygous diploid strain DJID7 - 1 to Ura + . Two stable Ura + Ts - transformants were shown by DNA - DNA blot hybridi - zation to have sustained fragment replacement by the trans - forming sequences at the site homologous to the cdc42 - com - plementing DNA ( Fig . 2 B ) . Dissection of 22 tetrads from these transformants yielded exclusively a segregation of 2 live , The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 111 , 1990 146 Figure 4 .

Mutagenesis was performed as described in Materials and Methods using M13mpl9 containing the 1 . 8 - kb Sca I - Xba I fragment ( see text ) as template . The column of letters is the wild - type CDC42 sequence ; the T to A transversion produced by muta - genesis is also indicated . Sequence 1 is of a control template that was not altered by the mutagenesis ; note that the uppermost two bands in the G lane are " ghost bands " that were not present in other sequencing runs on control templates . Sequence 2 is of a template containing the mutation . The dideoxy nucleotide used in each se - quencing reaction is indicated above the corresponding lane . Ura - Ts - : 2 dead , showing that the insertion of URA3 had produced a lethal mutation that was at or near the CDC42 lo - cus . Microscopic examination of the dead spore clones showed that they had undergone several rounds of cell division before arresting as large , unbudded cells ( like the cdc42 - 1 ts mu - tant ) . Moreover , the Ts - phenotype of the original diploid transformants showed that the new lethal mutation failed to complement the cdc42 - 1 ~ mutation , providing further evi - dence that the bona fide CDC42 gene had been cloned . Localization of CDC42 on the Complementing DNA To localize the CDC42 gene , subclones were constructed as described in Fig . 1 A . Complementation of the cdc42 - 1 mu - tation by plasmids YRp ( 42 ) l and YRp ( 42 ) 3 , but not by YRp ( 42 ) 2 , indicated that CDC42 lies within the 1 . 6 - kb Sca I - Nde I region . Subclones derived from this region all failed to complement the cdc42 - 1 mutation ( Fig . 1 B ) . However , cdc42 - 1 cells transformed with plasmid YEp ( 42 ) 3 yielded Ts + subclones at a frequency of ~ 10 - t when plated at 36°C . These subclones were stably Ts ÷ and Ura ÷ when grown un - der nonselective conditions , suggesting that integration of the plasmid had generated a complete , Ts ÷ copy of CDC42 from the complete , but mutant , copy originally in the chro - mosome and an incomplete , but otherwise wild - type , copy in the plasmid . Although the frequency of integration seemed surprisingly high ( see Discussion ) , this result sug - gested strongly that the cdc42 - 1 mutation lies to the right of the Hpa I site . In contrast , cdc42 - 1 cells transformed with either plasmid YEp ( 42 ) 4 or YEp ( 42 ) 5 yielded Ts ÷ subclones at frequencies no greater than those observed with the con - trol plasmid YEp24 , indicating that recombination - mediated marker rescue could not occur . This result was surprising in view of the data ( presented below ) suggesting that these two fragments span the entire CDC42 coding region ( see Dis - cussion ) . Localization of CDC42 was also attempted by determining the distribution of sites at which transposon insertion could inactivate cdc42 - complementing activity . Transposon - con - taining plasmids were collected and analyzed as described in Materials and Methods , then tested for cdc42 - comple - menting activity in strain DJTD2 - 16D . The results ( Fig . 1 B ) suggested that the CDC42 gene occupied a ~ , 0 . 9 - kb region lying mostly between the Hpa I and Nde I sites . Analysis of mRNA Transcripts RNA - DNA blot hybridization using a probe spanning the cdc42 - complementing region revealed only one major tran - script ( Fig . 2 C , lane / ) ~ 1 kb long ( as judged by its comigra - tion with the URA3 transcript ; data not shown ) . A 14 - fold longer exposure of the autoradiogram revealed a faint band corresponding to a transcript of , ' - , 3 kb , but did not reveal any additional transcripts of lower molecular weight ( Fig . 2 C , lane 2 ; see Discussion ) . Hybridization of the ~ l - kb tran - script to one of two single - strand probes ( Fig . 2 C , lanes 3 and 4 ) indicated that it is transcribed from left to right as shown in Fig . 1 B . Analysis of CDC42 Nucleotide and Predicted Amino Acid Sequences The 1 . 8 - kb Sca I - Xba I fragment from pBR ( 42 ) l was in - serted into M13mpl8 and M13mpl9 that had been digested with Sma I and Xba I . These phages and appropriate deletion derivatives ( see Materials and Methods ) were then used in dideoxy - sequencing reactions . Both strands of the cdc42 - complementing region between the Sca I and Nde I sites ( Fig . 1 B ) were completely sequenced using this strategy ( Fig . 3 ) . This analysis revealed the presence of eight ATG - initiated open reading frames ( ORFs ) ~ of > 140 codons ( Fig . 1 B ) and no TACTAAC consensus splicing sequence ( Lang - ford et al . , 1984 ) , suggesting an absence ofintrons . The vari - ous data presented above suggested strongly that the 191 codon ORF was the CDC42 gene , but did not completely eliminate the possibility that the 100 codon ORF on the other strand was responsible for CDC42 activity . To settle this point , we used site - directed mutagenesis to change the TTG L ~ u codon at nucleotides 208 - 210 of the 191 codon ORF ( see Fig . 3 ) to a TAG nonsense codon ( Fig . 4 ) . The cor - responding change in the 100 codon ORF was from ACA TM to ACT TM at codon 2 ; as both of these threonine codons are used frequently ( Bennetzen and Hall , 1982 ) , this change presumably would not affect the expression of the hypotheti - cal 100 amino acid gene product . DNA sequence analyses showed the absence of any other nucleotide changes within the 191 codon or 100 codon ORFs . After mutagenesis and sequence analysis , the Xho I - Hind III fragment containing the CDC42 region ( see Fig . 1 ; the Hind 1II site is next to the Xba I site in M13mpl9 ) was isolated from phage with and without the mutation and inserted into Sal I / Hind III - digested plasmid YEpl03 . The resulting plasmids that con - tained the mutation were unable to complement the cdc42 - 1 mutation in strain DJTD2 - 16D . In contrast , two control plas - mids that had been generated using the same procedure , but 1 . Abbreviation u . ~ ed in this paper : OR . F , open reading frame .

Similarities between the predicted amino acid sequences of the CDC42 gene product , the S . cerevisiae RII01 and Rtt02 gene products ( Madaule et al . , 1987 ) , the human rho gene product ( Madaule and Axel , 1985 ) , and the human H - ras gene product ( Capon et al . , 1983 ) . The one letter amino acid code is used . Numbering cor - responds to the human H - ras amino acid sequence . Dashes and asterisks indicate amino acids identical and related , respectively , to those of the CDC42 gene prod - uct . ( Amino acids considered related were aspartate and glutamate ; isoleucine , leucine , valine , and alanine ; lysine and arginine ; asparagine and glutamine ; and serine and threonine . ) Gaps were introduced by eye to maximize the amino acid similarities . Overlines indicate the regions for which peptide sequence data are available for the mam - malian protein G25K ( see tex0 . Note that the amino - terminal sequence of the human rho protein is missing because the available sequence was derived from an in - complete cDNA . did not contain the mutation , retained cdc42 - complementing activity . Thus , it seems clear that the 191 codon ORF en - codes the CDC42 gene product . The predicted CDC42 product is a polypeptide of 191 amino acids with molecular weight of 21 , 356 and a net charge of + 2 ( Fig . 3 ) . Comparison of the amino acid se - quence with the National Biomedical Research Foundation protein database revealed a high degree of similarity between the CDC42 product and members of the ms and rho families of gene products ( Fig . 5 ) . For example , the CDC42 product is 30 % identical ( 40 % identical or related ) in predicted amino acid sequence to the human H - ras product and com - parably similar to the yeast RAS1 and RAS2 gene products . Much of this similarity is in the regions of the ras proteins that have been implicated in GTP binding and hydrolysis ( residues 5 - 21 , 28 , 57 - 64 , 114 - , 120 , and 143 - 148 ; Dever et al . , 1987 ; de Vos et al . , 1988 ) and the COOH - terminal modifications leading to membrane association ( residues 186 - 189 : Clarke et al . , 1988 ; Hancock et al . , 1989 ; Schafer et al . , 1989 ) . Interestingly , however , the highly conserved Ash and Lys residues at positions 116 and 117 of ms , which have been implicated in the guanine specificity of the nucleotide - binding site , are replaced by Thr and Gln in CDC42 ( see also below ) . The similarities of CDC42 to the rho proteins are more extensive and more widely distributed through the coding regions . In particular , the CDC42 prod - uct is ' ~ 53 % identical ( ~ 58 % identical or related ) to the hu - man andAplysia rho gene products , 52 % identical ( 61 % iden - tical or related ) to the S . cerevisiae RIt01 gene product , and 37 % identical ( 51 % identical or related ) to the S . cerevisiae RII02 gene product , which is itself 53 % identical ( 66 % identical or related ) to the S . cerevisiae RII01 gene product . Although the available data are still limited , it appears that the closest homologue to CDC42 may be " G25K , " a 25 - kD GTP - binding protein that has been purified from several mammalian tissues ( Evans et al . , 1986 ; Waldo et al . , 1987 ; Polakis et al . , 1989 ) . Of the four peptides for which se - quence is available , three are very similar to regions in the CDC42 product ( overlined in Fig . 5 ) : t > 4 is identical in 19 / 20 positions to residues 47 - 66 of CDC42 ; p2 is identical in 10 / 12 ( and similar in 1 / 12 ) positions to residues 109 - 120 of CDC42 ; and pl is identical in 14 / 17 ( and similar in 1 / 17 ) po - sitions to residues 167 - 183 of CDC42 . It is worthy of special note that G25K , like CDC42 , has Thr - Gln instead of Asn - Lys in the putative guanine specificity region ( see above and Discussion ) .

Cells were grown on 2 % galactose as the sole car - bon source and stained with Caleofluor to reveal bud scars as described in Materials and Methods . ( . 4 and B ) Haploid strain DJMD22 - 3B containing ( A ) control plas - mid YEp51 or ( B ) plasmid YEp51 ( 42 ) . ( C and D ) Diploid strain DJDI containing ( C ) plasmid YEp51 or ( D ) plas - mid YEp51 ( 42 ) . Bars , 4 t ~ m . Expression of CDC42 under GALlO - promoter Control Inspection of the CDC42 sequence revealed that the Hpa I site is at position - 67 to - 62 relative to the putative initiator ATG codon ( Fig . 3 ) . This suggested that the lack of com - plementation and unusual marker - rescue results obtained with the Hpa I - Xba I fragment in plasmid YEp ( 42 ) 3 ( see above ) might have reflected the presence of only an incom - plete promoter in this fragment , a possibility consistent with the observation of potential TATA promoter sequences at po - sitions - 112 to - 107 and - 96 to - 91 ( see Fig . 3 ) . To explore this possibility , the Hpa I - Xba I fragment from plasmid pBR ( 42 ) l was inserted into the Sal I site of plasmid YEp51 so that the 191 codon ORF should be under the control of the yeast galactose - inducible GALIO promoter in the result - ing shuttle plasmid . This plasmid , YEp51 ( 42 ) , complemented the cdc42 - 1 mutation in strain DJMD22 - 3B when cells were grown on either 2 % glucose or 2 % galactose as the sole car - bon source , as judged by the cells ' ability to grow at a normal rate at 36°C . These results supported our interpretation of the results obtained with plasmid YEp ( 42 ) 3 ( see Discussion ) . However , even at 23°C , YEp51 ( 42 ) - containing cells growing on either carbon source displayed abnormalities in their bud - ding patterns , as revealed by the staining of bud scars with Calcofluor . In contrast to the normal unipolar budding pat - tern of haploid cells and bipolar budding pattern of diploid cells ( Fig . 6 A and C ; Sloat et al . , 1981 ) , we observed appar - ently random budding patterns in , ~ 75 % of YEp51 ( 42 ) - con - taining DJMD22 - 3B and DJD1 cells grown under derepressing conditions ( 2 % galactose ) and , ~ 35 % of YEp51 ( 42 ) - con - taining DJMD22 - 3B cells grown under repressing conditions ( 2 % glucose ) ( Fig . 6 , B and D ) . ( Note that only cells with two or more bud scars could be included in these counts ; 100 such cells were counted in each case . ) Only , ~ 10 % of the haploid or diploid ceils containing YEp51 itself exhibited such budding patterns when growing on either galactose or glucose . However , similar abnormalities of budding pattern were also observed in " ~ 50 % of DJTD2 - 16D cells containing the CDC42 gene on a 3 . 7 - kb Barn HI - Sal I fragment ( Fig . 1 A ) inserted into the high - copy number plasmid YEpl03 . Discussion The CDC42 gene product is involved in the morphogenetic steps of the yeast cell cycle . To begin exploring CDC42 func - tion at the molecular level , we have isolated and sequenced this gene . All cdc42 - complementing clones that we analyzed Johnson and Pringle Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC42 Gene 149 contained overlapping DNA segments , suggesting that the bona fide CDC42 gene had been isolated . This suggestion was confirmed by the findings that the isolated DNA segment could direct integration to the CDC42 locus and that deletion of this segment yielded a lethal mutation that failed to com - plement the cdc42 - 1 ~ mutation . Subcloning localized CDC42 to a 1 . 6 - kb segment of DNA , the sequencing of which re - vealed several ORFs . The longest of these was identified as CDC42 by several lines of evidence , including the results of transposon and site - directed mutagenesis , the demonstration that a plasmid in which this ORF should be expressed under GALIO control could complement a cdc42 - 1 ~ mutation , and the demonstration that the putative CDC42 mRNA was tran - scribed from the strand appropriate for this ORE This mRNA was somewhat longer than expected from the size of the ORF , and it is conceivable that the actual CDC42 transcript is a lower abundance species that we did not detect . However , it seems more likely that the CDC42 transcript has unusually extensive untranslated regions at the 5 ' end , the 3 ' end , or both . Further work will be necessary to resolve these issues . We obtained rather confusing results when we attempted to use recombination - mediated marker rescue ( Patterson et al . , 1986 ) to confirm that the bona fide CDC42 gene had been isolated and to localize the cdc42 - 1 ts mutation . Plas - mid YEp ( 42 ) 3 ( Fig . 1 B ) failed to complement the cdc424 t ~ mutation but yielded Ts + recombinant subclones at the sur - prisingly high frequency of ~ 10 % . As the insert in YEp ( 42 ) 3 spans the entire CDC42 ORE the failure of complementa - tion presumably results from the absence of an adequate pro - moter in the 64 bp of sequence 5 ' to the initiator ATG in this clone . This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the same fragment could complement the cdc424 ' ~ mutation when linked to the GALIO promoter . Interestingly , this com - plementation was observed both during growth on galactose and during growth on glucose , which should repress tran - scription from the GALIO promoter . Perhaps only a small amount of CDC42 mRNA is required and repression of the particular promoter construction used here ( the GALIO pro - moter plus 64 bp of CDC42 upstream sequence ) is incom - plete during growth on glucose . In any event , similar effects have been observed by others ( Broach , J . , personal commu - nication ) . The Ts + subclones observed with YEp ( 42 ) 3 apparently resulted from integration of the entire plasmid . It is clear that such integration could generate a complete , normal copy of the gene , but it is unclear why the event occurred in such high frequency . Perhaps the DNA segment contains a hot spot for recombination , or the production of some normal CDC42 product ( from a partially functional promoter in YEp ( 42 ) 3 ) allows the cells to survive long enough at restrictive temper - ature that the chances of rescue by plasmid integration are increased . Alternatively , there could be selection for such in - tegrants even during growth at the nominally " permissive " temperature ( see Adams et al . , 1990 ) . In contrast , neither plasmid YEp ( 42 ) 4 nor plasmid YEp ( 42 ) 5 ( Fig . 1 B ) yielded Ts + recombinant transfor - mants at a frequency detectably above control values , al - though the inserts of these plasmids , taken together , span the entire CDC42 coding region . A possible explanation for this result is that the cdc42 - 1 allele actually contains two muta - tions , such that neither plasmid ' s insert contains the wild - type information corresponding to both mutant sites . This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that only the one cdc42 ' s mutant was isolated in a search that yielded multiple independent mutants for each of the related genes CDC24 and CDC43 ( Adams et al . , 1990 ) . Sequencing of the cdc42 - 1 allele should resolve this point . Our results have provided some additional information about CDC42 function . First , the finding that overexpression of CDC42 can l ~ ad to mislocalization of budding sites sug - gests that the CDC42 product is involved in the initial selec - tion of the budding site as well as in the subsequent emer - gence of the bud . Interestingly , the same inference has been made about the CDC24 product on the basis of mutants that display a similar mislocalization of budding sites ( Sloat et al . , 1981 ) . In addition , deletion of RSR / ( another ms - related gene that seems to be involved in bud emergence ) produces a similar mislocalization of budding sites ( Bender and Prin - gle , 1989 ) , and overproduction of ABP ( actin - binding pro - tein ) 85 leads to a somewhat different abnormal pattern of budding ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) . It seems possible that these proteins are involved in marking the site at which bud emer - gence should occur , and that mislocalization of an over - produced or abnormal protein can thus perturb the normal budding pattern . However , it also remains possible that the mislocalization of budding sites in these situations simply reflects a less specific cellular pathology ( Hayashibe , 1975 ; Thompson and Wheals , 1980 ) . Second , the finding that the predicted CDC42 protein has substantial sequence similarity to the ras and rho families of proteins provides important , though limited , clues to its function at the molecular level . Much of this similarity is in the regions that have been implicated in the binding and hy - drolysis of GTP . In this regard , it is relevant that the Aplysia rho gene product has been shown to bind and hydrolyze GTP after expression in E . coli ( Anderson and Lacal , 1987 ) , and that the G25K protein ( which shares with CDC42 an unusual feature in the putative GTP - binding site : see Results ) binds guanine nucleotides avidly ( Evans et al . , 1986 ; Waldo et al . , 1987 ; Polakis et al . , 1988 ) . If the CDC42 product indeed also has GTP binding and hydrolysis activities ( a point to be tested as soon as CDC42 - specific antibodies are available ) , it is likely also to be involved in signal transduction of some sort . However , it is important to note that this biochemical motif has apparently been adapted to a wide variety of pur - poses in yeast . Confirmed or suspected GTP - binding / hydro - lyzing proteins identified to date include the RAS1 and RAS2 products , implicated in the control of adenylate cyclase and hence ( via the cAMP - dependent protein kinase ) in the over - all coordination of cell growth and macromolecular synthe - sis ( Powers et al . , 1984 ; Tatchell , 1986 ) ; the GS / / product , which may be involved in the Gl - to - S phase transition ( Kiku - chi et al . , 1988 ) ; the YFH product ( Gallwitz et al . , 1983 ) , which appears to be localized to the Golgi apparatus ( Segev et al . , 1988 ) and is implicated in the control of secretion and Ca 2 + flux ( Segev and Botstein , 1987 ; Wagner et al . , 1987 ) ; the SEC4 product , which is involved in post - Golgi apparatus events of the secretory pathway ( Salminen and Novick , 1987 ; Goud et al . , 1988 ) ; the SCG1 / GPA1 product , which appears to be involved in the pheromone response pathway ( Dietzel and Kurjan , 1987 ; Miyajima et al . , 1987 ) ; the GPA2 prod - uct , which may be involved in regulating cAMP levels ( Na - kafuku et al . , 1988 ) ; the CIN4 product , which appears to be involved in ensuring normal chromosome transmission dur - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 111 , 1990 150 ing mitosis ( Steams , T . , personal communication ) ; the ARF / and ARF2 gene products , which are similar to mammalian ADP - ribosylation factor ( Sewell and Kahn , 1988 ) ; and the Rtt01 and RH02 products , whose function ( s ) are unknown but apparently distinct from those of the RAS1 and RAS2 pro - ducts ( Madaule et al . , 1987 ) . There is no reason to think that this list is complete . Thus , the critical step in elucidating CDC42 function is likely to be determining what signals are transduced , and by means of what downstream effectors . On these points we have as yet few clues . The extensive sequence similarities be - tween the CDC42 product and the RHO gene products of yeast and animals suggests that there may be common aspects of function beyond GTP binding and hydrolysis . However , this clue is not too helpful until more is known of the function of the other RHO gene products . The similarity of cdc42 mutants to cdc24 mutants and the evidence that the CDC24 product is a Ca2 + - interactive protein ( Ohya et al . , 1986a , b ; Miyamoto et al . , 1987 ) suggest that signal trans - duction by the CDC42 product may also involve Ca 2 + , but there are no clues yet as to the nature of such possible in - volvement . Finally , the observation that the CDC42 product has COOH - terminal sequences similar to those at which ms and related proteins become modified by hydrophobic pros - thetic groups ( Clarke et al . , 1988 ; Goodman et al . , 1988 ; Molenaar et al . , 1988 ; Hancock et al . , 1989 ; Schafer et al . , 1989 ) suggests that the CDC42 product also may be modified as a mechanism for attachment to the cell membrane . This is an attractive notion if , as suggested above , one function of the CDC42 product is to help mark the site on the cell sur - face at which the new bud should emerge .
