Upon recruitment to intracellular membranes , the canonical clathrin triskelion assembles into a polyhedral protein coat that facili - tates vesicle formation and captures cargo molecules for trans - port . The triskelion is formed by trimerization of three clathrin heavy - chain subunits . Most vertebrates have two isoforms of clathrin heavy chains , CHC17 and CHC22 , generating two clathrins with distinct cellular functions . CHC17 forms vesicles at the plasma membrane for receptor - mediated endocytosis and at the trans - Golgi network for organelle biogenesis . CHC22 playsakeyroleinintracellulartargetingoftheinsulin - regulated glucose transporter 4 ( GLUT4 ) , accumulates at the site of GLUT4 sequestration during insulin resistance , and has also been implicated in neuronal development . Here , we demon - strate that CHC22 and CHC17 share morphological features , in that CHC22 forms a triskelion and latticed vesicle coats . However , cellular CHC22 - coated vesicles were distinct from those formed by CHC17 . The CHC22 coat was more stable to pH change and was not removed by the enzyme complex that disassembles the CHC17 coat . Moreover , the two clathrins were differentially recruited to membranes by adaptors , and CHC22 did not support vesicle formation or transferrin endocytosis at the plasma membrane in the presence or absence of CHC17 . Our findings provide biochemical evi - dence for separate regulation and distinct functional niches for CHC17 and CHC22 in human cells . Furthermore , the greater stability of the CHC22 coat relative to the CHC17 coat may be relevant to its excessive accumulation with GLUT4 during insulin resistance . Clathrin is a triskelion - shaped ( three - legged ) protein that is recruited by adaptor molecules to cellular membranes where it self - assembles into a latticed coat , driving membrane bud for - mation . Simultaneously , clathrin organizes adaptor molecules , capturing membrane - embedded cargo for sorting into result - ing clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) 4 ( 1 , 2 ) . Clathrin heavy - chain ( CHC ) subunits form a triskelion by trimerization at their C terminus . Most vertebrates ( mice being a notable exception ) have two CHC isoforms , CHC17 and CHC22 , generated by genome duplication during vertebrate evolution ( 3 ) . CHC17 triskelia mediate the canonical functions associated with clath - rin , including receptor - mediated endocytosis and lysosome biogenesis . Bound to the center of CHC17 triskelia are the clathrin light - chain ( CLC ) subunits that influence assembly and leg rigidity ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) . CHC22 , which does not naturally bind CLCs , still shares 85 % amino acid sequence identity with CHC17 ( 6 ) . Despite this high degree of homology , CHC22 plays different cellular roles than CHC17 clathrin . In humans , CHC22 is expressed primarily in muscle and fat ( 7 ) and appears transiently during neuronal development ( 8 ) in contrast to the ubiquitous and chronic expression of CHC17 . In muscle and fat , CHC22 is required for formation of the glucose transporter 4 ( GLUT4 ) storage compartment ( GSC ) , from which GLUT4 is This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants R56 - DK083589 , P30 - DK063720 ( a Pilot and Feasibility Study from the UCSF DERC ) , and R01 - DK095663 , Wellcome Trust Investigator Award 107858 / Z / 15 / Z ( to F .

Although mice have a similar insulin response leading to GLUT4 translocation in muscle and fat , CHC22 clathrin par - ticipation is a feature of human GSC formation that is absent from murine models . Additionally , CHC22 accumulates at over - loaded GLUT4 compartments that can form during insu - lin - resistant type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , suggesting a potential role for CHC22 in pathogenesis ( 7 ) . Here , we compare the biochemical , morphological , and functional properties of CHC17 and CHC22 to understand their ability to operate in separate biological niches and gain insight into the properties of assembled CHC22 that might be relevant to human insulin resistance . In this study , we have produced the first images of purified CHC22 CCVs and triske - lia , both resembling structures formed by CHC17 ( 10 – 12 ) . We demonstrate that CHC22 and CHC17 form segregated coated vesicles and that regulation of their membrane recruitment and disassembly , as well as uncoating , is distinct . Although a previ - ous report suggested that CHC22 could functionally substitute for CHC17 at the plasma membrane ( 13 ) , we found this not to be the case for either endocytic - coated vesicle formation or transferrin uptake . Thus fundamental biochemical differences underlie the non - redundant functions of the two clathrins . These differences are relevant to CHC22 function in human health and disease , and could account for some of the docu - mented differences in human and murine glucose metabolism noted from mouse models ( 14 , 15 ) . Results CHC22 forms coated vesicles that are distinct from those formed by CHC17 Functional studies indicate that CHC22 and CHC17 operate in separate membrane traffic pathways in formation of the human GLUT4 storage compartment ( 7 ) , and the two isoforms are separately immunoprecipitated from cell lysate ( 6 ) . Our previous immunofluorescence studies in human skeletal mus - cle showed that CHC17 and CHC22 are typically found at sep - arate locations in cells , with about 15 % overlap ( by Pearson’s correlation ) ( 7 ) . This suggests that a small fraction of intracel - lular membrane might be coated with mixtures of CHC17 and CHC22 . However , CHC22 was implicated as a component of CHC17 - coated vesicles by proteomics experiments , which showed that CHC22 was depleted from CCV preparations fol - lowing siRNA - mediated down - regulation of CHC17 ( 16 ) . We therefore sought to establish the degree to which CHC22 and CHC17 form mixed lattices in cells . To this end , we purified clathrin - coated vesicles from HeLa cells using the same CCV purification protocol as in the cited proteomics study ( 16 , 17 ) , and note that HeLa cells ( atypical for their tissue origin ) express CHC22 at similar levels to human myotubes ( 9 ) . We found that a Tris / acetate / EDTA ( TAE ) - buff - ered SDS - PAGE system described previously ( 18 ) separates CHC22 and CHC17 by electrophoretic mobility ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) and this analysis revealed that both isoforms were present in Figure 1 .

We then examined the CCVs by immunoelectron microscopy using an anti - CLC antibody to detect CHC17 and an isoform - specific anti - heavy - chain anti - body to detect CHC22 . Immunogold labeling with secondary antibodies coupled to different - sized gold particles revealed that CCVs were primarily labeled for only one CHC isoform ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) . Quantification showed that 93 . 1 % of CCVs with two or more gold particles were labeled by antibodies rec - ognizing either CHC22 or CHC17 but not both ( Fig . 1 E ) . Sta - tistical analysis of CCVs labeled with two gold particles demon - strated that the number of CCVs co - labeled for both CHC17 and CHC22 was significantly below the number that would be expected to co - label for both clathrins if mixed coats are formed , taking into account the efficiency of antibody labeling and the relative abundance ( 9 ) of the two clathrin heavy chains in HeLa cells ( Fig . 1 F ; “Experimental procedures” ) . Negatively stained images showed that vesicles labeled only for CHC22 were coated with lattices visually similar to CHC17 lattices ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) . This analysis by electron microscopy reveals that when purified from cells , CHC22 CCVs are predominantly dis - tinct from those formed by CHC17 ( Fig . 1 ) , although their lat - tices share morphology . CHC22 and CHC17 coats have distinct biochemical dissociation properties and both clathrins are triskelia The clathrin coat was first described for its lattice ( clathrate ) structure ( 19 ) , and later CHC17 clathrin was shown to be a triskelion ( 10 – 12 ) . We previously showed by size - exclusion chromatography that the recombinantly expressed C - terminal third of CHC22 ( Hub fragment , residues 1074 – 1640 ) forms a trimer ( 6 ) . However , due to low solubility ( different from the CHC17 Hub ) , it was not possible to obtain sufficient CHC22 Hub protein to visualize this fragment . Without a human tissue source for purifying CHC22 , we addressed whether we could purify CHC22 following over - expression in tissue culture and sought to take advantage of an existing HeLa cell transfectant ( HeLa - CHC22 (cid:4) x9 - TO ) that can over - express CHC22 (cid:4) x9 under the control of a Tet - On promoter ( 6 ) . CHC22 (cid:4) x9 pro - tein lacks 60 amino acids ( 457 – 507 encoded by Exon 9 ) com - prising the CHCR0 region between the distal leg and the N - terminal domain , so that CHC22 (cid:4) x9 is virtually full - length ( 1580 of 1640 residues ) with intact trimerization , proximal , and distal leg and terminal domains . Doxycycline treatment of HeLa - CHC22 (cid:4) x9 - TO caused CHC22 (cid:4) x9 to be the dominant clathrin in these cells ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . We then addressed whether CHC22 and CHC17 can be differentially dissociated from HeLa CCVs . It was previously observed that high pH combined with low salt concentrations efficiently strips CHC17 from membranes ( 20 ) , so we tested the effects of pH change in low salt on releasing CHC22 from CCVs purified from untransfected HeLa cells . Sequential exposure of mixed purified CCVs to increasing pH removed CHC17 without substantially dissociating CHC22 from their respec - tive CCVs . Only 13 % of CHC22 was solubilized at pH 8 . 5 , whereas 95 % of CHC17 was released from the CCV mixture ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . From the pellet of CCVs exposed to pH 8 . 5 , we were able to solubilize CHC22 by exposure to 0 . 5 M Tris Figure2 .

To obtain purified CHC22 (cid:4) x9 , CCVs were isolated from HeLa - CHC22 (cid:4) x9 - TO cells treated with doxycycline , then exposed to increasing pH to remove CHC17 , followed by Tris stripping the final pellet to release CHC22 (cid:4) x9 . To obtain puri - fied CHC17 for comparison , CCVs were purified from untrans - fected HeLa cells ( with a natural 10 - fold excess of CHC17 over CHC22 ) , then exposed to pH 7 . 0 , releasing CHC17 and leaving CHC22 behind on pelleted membranes . Immunoblotting with isoform - specific antibodies confirmed the purity of the CHC22 (cid:4) x9 and CHC17 obtained by these methods ( Fig . 2 E ) . Analysis of the separated purified clathrin isoforms by deep - etch electron microscopy showed that CHC22 (cid:4) x9 has the same triskelion configuration and approximate dimensions as CHC17 ( Fig . 2 F ) , providing morphological evidence that CHC22 is a triskelion . Differential enzymatic uncoating of CHC22 and CHC17 The CHC17 triskelia cycle from the cytosol to nascent CCVs at the plasma membrane or other organelles , and are returned back to the cytosol by uncoating fully closed CCVs ( 1 ) . Uncoat - ing is mediated by an ATPase complex consisting of the 70 - kDa heat - shock cognate protein ( Hsc70 ) and auxilin , and requires ATP hydrolysis ( 22 , 23 ) . Notably , CHC22 lacks the 5 - residue recognition site ( QLMLT ) for Hsc70 binding to CHC17 ( 24 ) ( Fig . 3 A ) . Our previous work showed that , at steady state , most cellular CHC22 is associated with membranes , whereas CHC17 is about half - cytosolic at any one time ( 6 ) , suggesting that CHC22 disassembly dynamics are different from those of CHC17 . Furthermore , the in vitro conditions necessary to dis - sociate CHC22 from CCVs for purification suggested differ - ences in properties of CHC22 lattices compared with CHC17 lattices . We therefore addressed whether CHC22 CCVs are uncoated by the same cellular mechanism that operates for CHC17 coat disassembly . CCVs purified from HeLa cells were incubated with recombinant uncoating complex ( UC , Hsc70 plus a functional fragment of auxilin ) with and without ATP . After centrifugation , CHCs released to the supernatant or remaining in the pellet were assessed by immunoblotting with isoform - specific antibodies ( Fig . 3 B ) . The UC plus ATP effec - tively removed more than 50 % of the CHC17 from CCVs under these conditions , but only 16 % of CHC22 was released ( Fig . 3 C ) . These data show that under conditions where CHC17 coats are efficiently removed , the Hsc70 – auxilin complex is significantly less efficient in uncoating CHC22 assemblies , consistent with loss of Hsc70 efficacy when the QLMLT sequence is deleted from CHC17 ( 24 ) . These findings indicate that CHC22 uncoat - ing proceeds differently from CHC17 uncoating . Cellular dissociation of CHC22 coats may be performed by different proteins or under different conditions than cellular CHC17 disassembly . Differential membrane recruitment of CHC22 and CHC17 Clathrin recruitment to membranes is driven by adaptor pro - teins that recognize phospholipids at specific intracellular loca - Figure3 .

Immunoisolation of CHC22 from HeLa cells and human skeletal muscle in earlier studies showed co - purification of the adaptors AP1 , AP3 , and GGA2 ( Golgi - associated , (cid:4) adaptin ear - containing , adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor – binding protein 2 ) , but not the plasma membrane - associated adaptor AP2 ( 6 , 7 ) . Although the adaptors bound to CHC22 also bind to CHC17 , immunoisola - tion showed more GGA2 co - isolated with CHC22 than with CHC17 relative to the other adaptors ( 7 ) , suggesting a possible mechanism for their differential recruitment . To address CHC interactions with GGA2 , we examined whether forced mem - brane association of GGA2 could attract CHC22 and / or CHC17 to membranes . It has been shown that membrane asso - ciation of GGA2 dramatically increases in HeLa cells stably expressing a chimeric CD8 protein with the cytoplasmic tail of CIMPR ( CD8 - CIMPR ) ( 26 ) . In these cells , we assessed the pro - portion of adaptors and clathrin that were membrane associ - ated by immunoblotting the membrane and cytosol fractions ( Fig . 3 , D and E ) . Compared with cells expressing CD8 without the cytoplasmic domain of CIMPR ( CD8 - WT ) , the fractions of GGA2 and CHC22 associated with membranes were signifi - cantly increased in the CD8 - CIMPR cells . The membrane local - ization of CHC17 appeared slightly increased in the CD8 - CIMPR cells , but this was not statistically significant ( Fig . 3 E ) . Thus , increased membrane association of GGA2 correlates with greater recruitment of CHC22 than CHC17 , supporting the biochemical evidence that preferential adaptor binding properties contribute to differential localization and functions of CHC22 and CHC17 . CHC22 does not substitute for CHC17 in endocytosis Our previous work localized CHC22 function to internal membrane traffic and showed by fluorescence microscopy that down - regulation of CHC22 did not affect receptor - mediated endocytosis of fluorescent transferrin ( Tf ) or epidermal growth factor ( 7 , 9 ) , consistent with lack of AP2 binding or co - localiza - tion with AP2 ( 6 , 7 ) . However , it was reported that in cells treated with siRNA to down - regulate CHC17 , over - expressed CHC22 was apparently able to rescue endocytosis of transfer - rin , suggesting potential redundant roles of the two heavy - chain isoforms ( 13 ) . To address whether CHC22 forms coated vesicles at the plasma membrane , we used electron microscopy to quantify the presence of clathrin - coated structures at the plasma mem - brane in cells treated with siRNA targeting CHC22 or CHC17 ( Fig . 4 ) . We found , as expected , that siRNA - mediated depletion of CHC17 caused near - complete elimination of clathrin - coated structures at the plasma membrane compared with control siRNA - treated cells . However , CHC22 depletion had no signif - icant effect on the prevalence of clathrin - coated pits or vesicles at the plasma membrane compared with cells treated with con - trol siRNA ( Fig . 4 ) . Together with our previous work showing that CHC22 is not localized to the plasma membrane ( 6 , 9 ) , these new data establish that endogenous CHC22 does not sup - port formation of clathrin - coated structures at the plasma membrane . To address whether CHC22 can substitute for CHC17 func - tionally in endocytosis , we used a fluorescence - activated cell sorter ( FACS ) to quantitatively measure Tf uptake and directly measure levels of expression of each clathrin . To ensure analy - sis of true receptor - mediated endocytosis and not pinocytosis , we exposed cells to 10 (cid:5) g / ml of fluorescently labeled Tf at 4 °C for surface binding , then washed to remove excess ( unbound ) Tf prior to warming the cells to 37 °C . After uptake , residual surface Tf was stripped with acidic buffer ( Fig . 5 A ) so that cell - associated fluorescence represented only internalized Tf from the pulsed exposure ( “Experimental procedures” ) . To establish whether CHC22 can replace CHC17 function in receptor - me - diated Tf endocytosis , we confirmed that down - regulation of CHC17 but not CHC22 affected Tf uptake ( Fig . 5 , B - D ) . Cells treated to down - regulate either CHC17 or CHC22 were then sequentially transfected to express siRNA - resistant CHC17 or CHC22 , tagged with GFP ( Fig . 5 , C - G , supplemental Fig . S1 ) . The GFP tag on both “rescue” constructs made it possible to measure their relative expression levels ( Fig . 5 E ) , so that we Figure 4 .

We observed that in the absence of CHC17 , transfection of CHC22 did not rescue Tf uptake in this assay ( Fig . 5 F ) , even when expressed at a higher level than that effective for rescue by CHC17 ( Fig . 5 E ) . Starting levels of surface - bound Tf were sim - ilar for CHC17 - depleted cells transfected with either rescue construct ( Fig . 5 G ) . Transfection of HeLa cells that were treated with control siRNA or with siRNA targeting CHC22 con - firmed that internalization was not reduced by these treat - ments and showed increased Tf uptake when GFP - CHC17 was transfected but not when GFP - CHC22 was transfected ( supplemental Fig . S1 ) . Taken together , the electron microscopy analysis of coated pit formation and the Tf uptake assays presented here are con - sistent with our previous studies , and strongly support the con - clusion that CHC22 does not participate in receptor - mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane . Discussion In this study , we examined the morphology and biochemical properties of CHC22 clathrin , which we have previously shown is involved in regulation of GLUT4 membrane traffic in humans ( 7 ) . We show for the first time that CHC22 forms a latticed coat on CCVs that are distinct from CHC17 - coated vesicles . We also extend our initial biochemical observations that the C - terminal third of CHC22 forms a trimer ( 6 ) to show that the nearly full - length CHC22 (cid:4) x9 , and by inference full - length CHC22 , has a triskelion shape similar to that of CHC17 . Notably , we find that the CHC22 lattice is stable under alkalin - izing conditions that disassemble CHC17 and that its uncoating properties differ from those of CHC17 . Specifically , the uncoat - ing ATPase complex of Hsc70 and auxilin that acts to remove CHC17 from membranes does not effectively uncoat CHC22 under the same conditions , suggesting that CHC22 is uncoated less efficiently in cells or uncoated by an alternative mechanism . Finally , we show that CHC22 does not function in coat forma - tion at the plasma membrane or receptor - mediated endocyto - sis of transferrin and that the “internal” adaptor GGA2 plays a role in preferential recruitment of CHC22 to membranes over CHC17 . Together , our data indicate that different biochemical properties underlie the different cellular functions of the two vertebrate CHCs . Human GLUT4 trafficking epitomizes the different cellular functions of CHC22 and CHC17 . In humans , 70 % of post - pran - dial blood glucose is cleared by import into skeletal muscle and fat using the GLUT4 transporter that is released from its intra - cellular storage compartment in response to insulin ( 27 , 28 ) . Our previous work supports a role for CHC22 in targeting GLUT4 to this insulin - responsive compartment , whereas CHC17 is known to control a different part of the GLUT4 traf - ficking pathway by mediating endocytosis of GLUT4 to termi - nate insulin - stimulated glucose uptake ( 7 , 29 ) . In muscle from insulin - resistant T2D patients , GLUT4 trafficking is perturbed such that GLUT4 is not released to the cell surface in response to insulin . Instead , GLUT4 intracellular storage compartments become over - loaded with GLUT4 . CHC22 clathrin accumu - lates at the abnormal GLUT4 compartments , whereas CHC17 localization seems unaffected ( 7 ) . We identify GGA2 as a pref - erential CHC22 adaptor , and GGA2 has been previously shown to mediate trafficking of GLUT4 to the same intracellular GLUT4 storage compartment where CHC22 accumulates ( 30 ) . Furthermore , we demonstrate here that CHC22 lattices are resistant to cellular and biochemical uncoating conditions that disassemble CHC17 , indicating that CHC22 coats are appar - ently more stable and could be pathogenic in excess . Indeed , we showed previously that expression of CHC22 in mouse muscle , where it is not normally expressed , excessively traps GLUT4 in intracellular compartments leading to elevated blood glucose ( 7 ) . Together these observations lead us to speculate that enhanced CHC22 accumulation at the aberrant GLUT4 storage compartment that results from insulin resistance might con - tribute to and exacerbate GLUT4 retention . It is notable that separate roles for CHC22 and CHC17 were also observed in a cell line model of transient CHC22 expression during neuronal development ( 8 ) . Thus , distinct roles of these clathrins have potential significance for additional physiological pathways . The findings reported here further support segregated intra - cellular functions of CHC22 and CHC17 clathrin and resolve debates about their functional redundancy ( 13 , 16 ) . We dem - onstrate by electron microscopy that CHC22 does not form endocytic structures at the plasma membrane , when present at its normal levels of expression , even when CHC17 is down - regulated . Furthermore , consistent with lack of CHC22 co - im - munoprecipitation with the AP2 adaptor ( 6 , 7 ) , we show that when CHC17 is depleted from cells to inhibit receptor - medi - ated endocytosis of Tf , expression of CHC22 does not rescue CHC17 function . We designed this latter experiment to specif - ically test receptor - mediated endocytosis because previous experiments reporting the ability of CHC22 to replace depleted CHC17 in transferrin uptake ( 8 , 13 ) used a 5 - or 10 - fold higher concentration of transferrin without washing out excess prior to uptake or stripping residual surface - bound Tf after uptake . In these previous studies , internalization was assessed by con - focal microscopy and receptor - mediated endocytosis would have been accompanied by pinocytosis of unbound Tf . In the present study , we used quantitative FACS , non - saturating con - centrations of transferrin , and washed away excess before initiating internalization and residual surface bound Tf was removed , thus measuring only internalized Tf . In this assay , CHC22 did not restore Tf uptake that was inhibited by deple - tion of CHC17 , even though CHC22 expression was higher than levels of CHC17 that rescued Tf endocytosis . Here we further support the non - redundant functions of the two clath - rins by our observation that CHC22 and CHC17 form separate CCVs in cells . We also did not observe decreased CHC22 upon CHC17 depletion ( Figs . 4 C and 5 C ) , as suggested by Borner et al . ( 16 ) . Using siRNA targeting the separate isoforms we often see the opposite effect , that CHC22 levels tend to increase upon CHC17 depletion ( 7 , 9 ) ( although no significant increase was observed in the experiments shown here ) . We have shown that whereas CHC22 does not co - immunoprecipitate with AP2 , it does associate with some adaptors that are also bound by CHC17 , including AP1 and GGA2 ( 6 , 7 ) . If CHC17 is depleted , sites on these adaptors would become available for CHC22 binding , possibly explaining increased stability of CHC22 CHC22 biochemistry 20840 J . Biol . Chem .

Here we identify GGA2 as a shared adaptor that seems to pref - erentially recruit CHC22 to intracellular membranes . Because this preference is not dramatic , we propose that there are addi - tional adaptors unique to CHC22 recruitment , which would be required to increase local CHC22 concentration such that it could compete with CHC17 for shared adaptor interactions . In conclusion , we find that although CHC22 is similar to CHC17 in morphology , the biochemical characteristics of these two clathrin heavy chains with 85 % sequence identity are quite different . Their uncoating and membrane recruitment are dif - ferentially regulated , and we propose that elucidation of these mechanisms could provide insight into the pathogenesis and treatment of insulin resistance leading to T2D . Furthermore , identification of CHC22’s triskelion shape and its ability to form stable lattices set the stage for further structural and bio - chemical understanding of CHC22 regulation and its role in human glucose homeostasis ( 7 ) , as well as in pathways of neu - ronal development ( 8 ) . Experimental procedures Cell culture HeLa cells ( Subtype 229 ) were grown in DMEM high glucose supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 50 units / ml of penicillin , and 50 (cid:5) g / ml of streptomycin . HeLa cells stably expressing a doxycycline - inducible construct , pJM601 - CHC22 (cid:4) x9 ( HeLa - CHC22 (cid:4) x9 - TO cells ) ( 6 ) were supple - mented with 50 (cid:5) g / ml of G418 and grown in media supple - mented with tetracycline - free FBS . Expression of CHC22 (cid:4) x9 was induced in HeLa - CHC22 (cid:4) x9 - TO cells by adding 1 (cid:5) g / ml of doxycycline ( or as indicated ) , and cells were cultured 24 h before harvest . Stable HeLa cell clones expressing CD8 con - structs ( from Matthew Seaman , Cambridge University ) were produced and cultured as described ( 26 ) . siRNA - mediated depletion of CHC isoforms HeLa cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting CHC17 ( 40 n M ) , CHC22 ( 20 n M ) , or All - Star Negative control siRNA ( 40 n M ) ( Qiagen ) ( 31 ) using JetPrime (cid:2) ( Polyplus ) transfection reagent according to the manufacturers’ instructions . Cells were analyzed 72 or 96 h after transfection was initiated . Preparation of membrane and CCV fractions CCV preparation was similar to Hirst et al . ( 17 ) . HeLa cells or HeLa - CHC22 (cid:4) x9 - TO cells exposed to 1 (cid:5) g / ml of doxycycline were grown on four 500 - cm 2 dishes . Cells were rinsed with ice - cold PBS followed by ice - cold Buffer A ( 0 . 1 M MES , pH 6 . 5 , 0 . 2 m M EGTA , 0 . 5 m M MgCl 2 , 0 . 02 % NaN 3 , 0 . 2 m M PMSF ) , then scraped in 4 ml of Buffer A per dish . Homogenization by Potter - Elvehjem homogenizer ( 15 strokes ) or by sonication was fol - lowed by centrifugation ( 2 , 000 (cid:8) g for 30 min ) , and superna - tants were treated with 10 (cid:5) g / ml of RNase A ( 30 min , 4 °C ) . Membranes were then pelleted ( 109 , 000 (cid:8) g , 30 min ) and resus - pended in 300 (cid:5) l of Buffer A . To separate CCVs from the mem - brane fraction , the suspension was mixed with equal volumes ( 300 (cid:5) l ) of 12 . 5 % Ficoll and 12 . 5 % sucrose in Buffer A and cen - trifuged ( 17 , 400 (cid:8) g , 30 min ) . The supernatant was diluted with 4 volumes of Buffer A ( 2 . 4 ml ) , and CCVs were pelleted ( 109 , 000 (cid:8) g , 30 min ) . Pellets were resuspended in 100 (cid:5) l of Buffer A . Isolation of CHC isoforms for imaging To purify CHC22 (cid:4) x9 , CCV pellets isolated from HeLa - CHC22 (cid:4) x9 - TO cells suspended in HEPES buffer ( 10 m M HEPES - NaOH , pH 6 . 5 , 0 . 2 m M EGTA , 0 . 02 % NaN 3 ) , then cen - trifuged ( 100 , 000 (cid:8) g , 30 min ) . The resulting pellet was stripped gradually of CHC17 by sequential exposure to HEPES buffer with increasing pH ( 10 m M HEPES - NaOH , pH 7 . 0 , 7 . 5 , 8 . 0 , 8 . 5 , 0 . 2 m M EGTA , 0 . 02 % NaN 3 ) , spinning out the pellet after each extraction . The final pellet was resuspended in high Tris buffer ( 50 % Buffer A and 50 % 1 M Tris - HCl , 2 m M EDTA , 0 . 4 m M PMSF , pH 7 . 0 ) , then centrifuged to yield a supernatant contain - ing pure CHC22 (cid:4) x9 , which was imaged . To produce a similar preparation of purified CHC17 , CCVs were isolated from untransfected HeLa cells and washed in HEPES buffer , pH 6 . 5 , then CHC17 was stripped from the resulting pellet by extrac - tion in HEPES buffer , pH 7 . 0 . Deep - etch replicas of each sepa - rated CHC were prepared by adsorbing proteins on mica flakes and then quick - freezing , freeze - fracturing , deep - etching , and platinum - replicating ( 32 ) , in a fee - for - service arrangement at the Washington University Center for Cellular Imaging , St . Louis , MO . Separation of CHC isoforms by SDS - PAGE CHC isoforms were separated by electrophoresis in contin - uous TAE - buffered SDS - PAGE ( 18 ) . TAE gels were prepared with 6 . 3 % acrylamide , 0 . 17 % bisacrylamide , 0 . 1 M Tris - HCl , 0 . 2 M sodium acetate , 0 . 02 M EDTA , 0 . 1 % SDS , pH 7 . 4 , and polym - erized with 0 . 075 % tetramethylethylenediamine and 0 . 75 % ammonium persulfate . Samples in standard Laemmli SDS buffer were electrophorese d 3 h in 0 . 1 M Tris - HCl , 0 . 2 M sodium acetate , 0 . 02 M EDTA , 0 . 1 % SDS , pH 7 . 4 , at 100 mA ( (cid:9) 70 V ) , at 22 °C . Immunoblotting Protein samples were separated by SDS - PAGE ( 10 % acryl - amide or TAE , 6 . 3 % acrylamide ) and transferred to nitrocellu - lose . TAE gels were incubated in transfer buffer ( 50 m M Tris , 39 m M glycine , 0 . 037 % SDS , 20 % methanol pH 8 . 3 ) for 30 min at 22 °C prior to transfer . Membranes were labeled with primary antibodies ( 1 – 5 (cid:5) g / ml ) as follows : anti - CHC17 ( TD . 1 , self - raised mouse monoclonal against CHC17 terminal domain ) ( 33 ) or anti - CHC22 ( SHL - KS , affinity purified self - raised rabbit polyclonal against CHC22 C terminus cross - absorbed against the CHC17 C terminus ) ( 6 , 34 ) . For Fig . 1 A , TD . 1 antibody at 0 . 27 (cid:5) g / ml was mixed with SHL - KS to achieve equivalent label - ing of both CHC isoforms . Horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - con - jugated secondary antibodies were detected using ECL TM re - agent ( Amersham Biosciences ) . Quantification was performed using ImageJ ( NIH ) . Uncoating assays Uncoating experiments were modified from a published pro - tocol ( 35 ) . To prepare CCVs , HeLa cells ( confluent 500 cm 2 dish ) were rinsed three times in PBS ( 4 °C ) , removed by scrap - CHC22 biochemistry J . Biol . Chem .

Homogenates were centri - fuged ( 1000 (cid:8) g , 15 min ) , then the post - nuclear supernatants were centrifuged ( 10 min , 100 , 000 (cid:8) g ) . To generate a crude CCV fraction , the pellet was exposed to detergent to remove uncoated membranes , then rinsed to remove excess detergent , resuspended in 900 (cid:5) l of uncoating buffer ( room temperature , 15 min to release free triskelia ) , then centrifuged ( 10 min , 100 , 000 (cid:8) g ) and resuspended in 900 (cid:5) l of uncoating buffer ( 50 (cid:5) g / ml ) . The uncoating reaction was allowed to reach steady - state for 10 min , 37 °C with full - length rat Hsc70 ( 1 . 3 (cid:5) M ) recombinantly produced in Sf9 cells , GST - auxilin ( 401 – 910 ) ( bovine ) ( 0 . 13 (cid:5) M ) recombinantly produced in BL21 - DE bacte - ria , and ATP ( 0 . 5 m M ) ( 36 ) , then samples were centrifuged ( 30 min , 100 , 000 (cid:8) g ) to analyze pellet and supernatant by immu - noblotting for CHCs . Immunogold labeling of HeLa CCVs CCVs prepared from HeLa cells ( Buffer A ) were adsorbed to freshly glow - discharged formvar / carbon - coated copper mesh EM grids for 2 min . Samples were washed by transferring EM grids between 20 - (cid:5) l drops of buffer A to buffer G ( 25 m M HEPES , 125 m M potassium acetate , 5 m M magnesium acetate , pH 7 . 2 ) , then fixed on 20 (cid:5) l of 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde in buffer G for 15 min . Samples were blocked by transfer over buffer G , then PBS , then PBS with 0 . 15 M glycine , pH 7 . 2 , for 5 min , and PBS with 1 % ( m / v ) fish gelatin for 30 min . Samples were double - labeled with mouse monoclonal anti - CLC ( decorating CHC17 ) ( CON . 1 , 4 (cid:5) g / ml ) ( 33 ) and anti - CHC22 ( SHL - KS , diluted 1 : 200 ) in PBS with 1 % fish gelatin for 1 h , then washed by suc - cessive transfer over six 20 - (cid:5) l drops of PBS with 1 % fish gelatin . To minimize background from secondary antibodies ( 5 / 10 nm gold - labeled goat anti - mouse / rabbit antibodies diluted 1 : 30 in 1 % fish gelatin in PBS ) , diluted antibodies were pre - adsorbed on unlabeled , fixed HeLa CCVs on EM grids for 1 h , then 20 (cid:5) l were used to detect primary antibody labeling for 1 h . After labeling , samples were washed three times in PBS with 1 % fish gelatin , twice in PBS , then fixed in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in PBS ( 10 min ) , washed twice with PBS and distilled water and stained with ( 2 % ( m / v ) uranyl acetate / water ) . All steps were at room temperature ( 22 °C ) . Statistical analysis of immunogold - labeled HeLa CCVs Although only 6 . 9 % of multi - labeled CCVs contained labels for CHC17 and CHC22 , we asked if this proportion was signif - icantly different from what we would expect if all CCV coats contained both heavy chains . This analysis is complicated by several factors , including : 1 ) the actual abundance of each pro - tein in cells , CHC17 is (cid:9) 10 times more abundant than CHC22 ( 9 ) ; 2 ) the efficiency of each primary and secondary antibody used for staining , likely to be different for each epitope and difficult to estimate ; and 3 ) the proportion of each CHC that is in CCVs as opposed to free in the cytosol , again unknown , although our previous data and those presented here indicate that CHC22 is more likely to be found on membranes than CHC17 . Given these unknowns , we used the CCVs with only one label ( by definition either CHC17 or CHC22 ) to empirically determine the likelihood of a given label being CHC17 or CHC22 . This analysis showed that a given label had a 62 . 6 % chance of being CHC17 and a 37 . 4 % chance of being CHC22 . We used these probabilities to calculate the expected number of dual - labeled CCVs . As this is simplest in the case of CCVs labeled with exactly two gold particles we limited our statistical analysis to this case , which included 190 analyzed CCVs . We calculated expected numbers to be : 1 ) both labels are CHC22 (cid:2) 14 or 26 % CCVs ; 2 ) one CHC17 label and one CHC22 label (cid:2) 47 or 89 % CCVs ; 3 ) both labels are CHC17 (cid:2) 40 or 75 % CCVs ; if all CCVs are composed of CHC17 and CHC22 at a 10 : 1 ratio . We then conducted a (cid:3) 2 test to determine whether our observed 11 dual - labeled CCVs was significantly lower than the expected 89 dual - labeled CCVs . This was highly significant ( p (cid:3) 0 . 0001 , n (cid:2) 190 CCVs with two labels , df (cid:2) 1 ) , suggesting that CHC17 and CHC22 form separate populations of CCVs . Embedding and ultra - thin sectioning of HeLa cells For ultra - thin sectioning , siRNA - treated HeLa cells washed twice ( 5 m M EDTA , 4 . 5 g / liter of glucose in PBS , pH 7 . 3 , 37 °C ) were resuspended ( same buffer , 10 min ) and an aliquot was removed to assess expression of CHC isoforms by immunoblot - ting . Cells ( pelleted 300 (cid:8) g , 6 min , 4 °C ) were fixed ( 3 % glutar - aldehyde in 0 . 1 M cacodylate , pH 7 . 2 ) , then processed for embedding in Epon and stained as described ( 37 ) . For quantifi - cation of clathrin - coated structures , images of ultra - thin sec - tions of embedded cells were analyzed using NIH ImageJ by observers blind to condition . FACS - based assay of Tf uptake HeLa cells were treated with siRNA targeting each CHC or All - Star Negative control siRNA ( 20 n M ) ( Qiagen ) for 72 h . During the last 24 h of siRNA transfection , cDNA encoding green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged CHC17 or CHC22 was transfected and experiments were started the next day . For transferrin uptake assays , cells were starved of FBS for 2 h in uptake media ( DMEM (cid:6) 0 . 1 % BSA ) then incubated with Alexa Fluor 647 - coupled transferrin ( Tf - AF647 Thermo Fisher Scien - tific ) , 10 (cid:5) g / ml in ice - cold uptake media ; for 10 min on ice . Unbound Tf - AF647 was removed by 3 successive washes ( ice - cold PBS ) . Uptake was then initiated by adding warm uptake media to the cells and endocytosis was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 37 °C . After uptake , cells were placed back on ice and residual surface - bound Tf - AF647 was removed by 3 successive washes ( ice - cold PBS ) , followed by two acid washes ( 0 . 15 M glycine buffer , pH 3 ) to strip any remaining surface Tf - AF647 , and finally a further 3 successive washes ( ice - cold PBS ) . The cells were then fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min on ice and then 15 min at room temperature .

To develop and validate the FACS - based Tf - uptake assay , three control conditions were evaluated for each assay : ( i ) cells were mock - treated without Tf - AF647 to determine the non - specific fluorescent background ; ( ii ) cells were fixed with para - formaldehyde after removal of excess Tf - AF647 to determine the amount of surface transferrin bound prior to uptake ; ( iii ) cells were left on ice after binding Tf and then exposed to an acidic strip to test the efficacy of surface - bound Tf stripping .

For each assay , FACS results were normalized to samples treated with control siRNA ( siCon ) with no CHC - expressing DNA , as 100 % uptake . Results from six assays were pooled to create the graphs reported in Fig . 5 . CHC22 expression , CHC17 expression , sur - face - bound Tf , and Tf - uptake were each analyzed by one - way ANOVA ( GraphPad Prism ) to determine the effect of CHC17 and CHC22 levels on Tf uptake .
