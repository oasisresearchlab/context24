While the template - dependent biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins provides stability and rigidity to genetic information , glycans are synthesized without any templates . The biosynthesis of glycans by mixtures of glycosyltransferases and other modification enzymes gives heterogeneity and flexibility to glycan structures and contributes to the regulation of context - dependent cellular functions . The direct assessments of these concepts are , nevertheless , hampered by the same inherent complexities in the sequence and composition of the generated glycoforms . Proteoglycans are biomacromolecules that harbor glycosami - noglycan chains 1 . Glycosaminoglycans are long , sulfated glycans with repeating disaccharide units , among which chondroitin sul - fate ( CS ) , keratan sulfate ( KS ) and heparan sulfate ( HS ) are com - mon in proteoglycans . These glycans have variable patterns of sulfate and sulfamate groups , augmenting the heterogeneity that is crucial for biological activities . They are major components of the extracellular matrix and are also richly expressed on the surface of cells in the central nervous system ( CNS ) 2 where they regulate aspects of CNS development and homeostasis , such as experience - dependent plasticity and axon guidance 3 , 4 . Regarding axonal growth , CS - proteoglycans ( CS - PGs ) and KS - proteoglycans show inhibitory effects . Digestion of CS and KS chains improve axonal regeneration or sprouting and promote functional recovery after CNS injury 5 – 7 . In contrast , HS - PGs enhance axonal growth 8 . CS and HS compete for the neuronal receptors PTPR σ and LAR 9 – 12 at the same binding site ( the first Ig - like domain ) 13 , although HS also binds to an addi - tional site at the juxta - membrane region 14 . Both PTPR σ and LAR belong to the type IIa receptor - type protein tyrosine phosphatase ( RPTP ) family in which the phosphatase activities are turned on by ligands that induce receptor monomerization and turned off by ligands that induce receptor clustering 15 . Accordingly , a molecular switch model of PTPR σ has been proposed to explain the oppos - ing effect of CS and HS in regulating axonal growth 13 . However , the underlying mechanisms are still elusive . Here , we examine the patterns of sulfate and sulfamate groups within CS and HS that are needed for binding to PTPR σ and LAR to further understand the factors affecting axonal fate . A sugar library containing HS oligosaccharides with variable modification patterns has been prepared for this purpose . These compounds , together with synthetic CS oligomers with defined sulfation motifs , enable the identification of features that govern the clustering or monom - erization of PTPR σ and the biological importance of this behavior . We show that the inhibition of axonal regeneration by CS is a result of the disruption of autophagy flux , leading to autophagosome accu - mulation and dystrophic endball formation . This could be reversed by HS oligosaccharides holding sulfate and sulfamate groups with sufficient length to induce receptor clustering . We have also found that cortactin , an actin - binding protein implicated in autophagy flux , is a direct substrate for PTPR σ . Altogether , our data highlight a pathway associating glycosaminoglycans , PTPR σ and cortactin in axonal growth inhibition and regeneration . Results Preparation of HS sugar library .

CS inhibits axonal growth , while HS promotes it . Here , we have prepared a library of HS octasaccharides and , together with synthetic CS oligomers , we found that PTPR σ preferentially interacts with CS - E—a rare sulfation pattern in natural CS—and most HS oligomers bearing sulfate and sulfamate groups . Consequently , short and long stretches of natural CS and HS , respectively , bind to PTPR σ . CS activates PTPR σ , which dephosphorylates cor - tactin—herein identified as a new PTPR σ substrate—and disrupts autophagy flux at the autophagosome – lysosome fusion step . Such disruption is required and sufficient for dystrophic endball formation and inhibition of axonal regeneration . Therefore , sulfation patterns determine the length of the glycosaminoglycan segment that bind to PTPR σ and define the fate of axonal regeneration through a mechanism involving PTPR σ , cortactin and autophagy .

Epimerization of several GlcA residues to α - l - iduronic acid ( IdoA ) and formation of multiple sulfate and sulfamate groups all contribute to the extreme microheterogeneity of the mature poly - saccharide 16 . Natural HS chains also display segments with high levels of modification interspersed with sequences of unmodified residues . Capturing the scale of this complexity in well - defined syn - thetic compounds is a challenge to carbohydrate chemists . With this in mind , we aimed to prepare an octasaccharide library covering a reasonable sample of the functional group com - position of HS to help clarify its roles in axonal fate . Our synthetic strategy incorporates convergent assembly 17 , 18 and divergent func - tional group transformations 19 . This approach should allow access to several compounds in a fast and efficient manner . We applied a key orthogonal protecting group combination 17 , 18 to bring the variability of HS and enable differential functionalization at the octasaccharide level . Two sequence backbones were targeted , spe - cifically , that with IdoA as the only uronic acid residue present and another with alternating IdoA and GlcA residues . Thus , sequential ( 2 + 2 ) and ( 4 + 4 ) glycosylations starting from disaccharide build - ing blocks 1 – 3 effectively provided , through tetrasaccharides 4 and 5 , the desired fully protected octasaccharides 6 and 7 ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Note ) . The functional group transformations toward the final com - pounds were then tackled .

Thus , 16 HS octasaccharide analogs ( 8 – 23 ) were completed from just two fully protected octasaccharide precursors . Our implementation of the divergent strategy , on this length and extent , shows its effectiveness in acquiring numerous HS octasac - charides to form the desired compound library . Essential structures of CS and HS on axonal fate . We speculated that specific functional binding domains within the CS or HS chains permit interaction with PTPR σ and LAR . CS chains are composed of alternating GlcA and N - acetyl - β - d - galactosamine ( GalNAc ) residues . Each unit is differentially modified by sulfate formation resulting in heterogeneous sequences with specific motifs desig - nated as CS - O , CS - A , CS - C , CS - D and CS - E depending on the sul - fate group pattern . To identify the binding structures in CS , we first checked the interactions between PTPR σ and CS polysaccharides enriched with particular sulfation motifs using surface plasmon res - onance ( SPR ) . Among these compounds , the CS - E - enriched poly - saccharide ( derived from squid ) , where a major proportion of the repeating disaccharides have sulfate groups at both C - 4 and C - 6 of GalNAc , showed the best affinity to PTPR σ ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) , matching previous reports 20 , 21 . Because these sugars are still hetero - geneous in terms of size and functionalization , we used chemically defined synthetic CS tetrasaccharides 22 , 23 . Biotinylated tetrasaccha - rides with CS - O , CS - A and CS - E units ( 24 , 25 and 26 , respectively ; Fig . 1b ) were immobilized , and the receptors PTPR σ and LAR were injected as analytes . Complementing the aforementioned results , only the CS - E tetrasaccharide 26 showed high affinity to both receptors ( Fig . 2a ) , with K D values of 17 nM and 16 nM for PTPR σ and LAR , respectively ( Fig . 2b ) . The biotinylated CS - E disaccharide 27 did not bind to these receptors ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . These results suggest that the CS - E tetrasaccharide is the minimal CS structure required for binding to PTPR σ and LAR . Because HS and CS share a binding site on PTPR σ 13 , we estab - lished a competition assay on SPR to determine the receptor - binding structure of HS . Briefly , 26 was immobilized on a sensor chip , and then two analytes ( first the receptor and then the HS oligosaccharide ) were injected sequentially without any regener - ating procedures . Three possible sensorgram patterns are shown in Supplementary Fig . 2a . Heparin , a highly sulfated variant of HS , successfully eluted PTPR σ and LAR from 26 ( Supplementary e 500 1 , 000 1 , 500 2 , 000 – 500 0 500 1 , 000 1 , 500 0 Time ( s ) R e s pon s e ( RU ) K D = 107 nM – 200 0 200 400 600 800 1 , 000 – 200 0 200 400 600 800 – 50 1 , 500 2 , 000 – 100 0 50 100 150 500 1 , 000 0 – 200 0 200 400 600 800 1 , 000 Time ( s ) – 50 – 100 0 50 100 150 Time ( s ) Time ( s ) Time ( s ) Time ( s ) R e s pon s e ( RU ) R e s pon s e ( RU ) R e s pon s e ( RU ) R e s pon s e ( RU ) R e s pon s e ( RU ) 8 9 14 15 23 0 1 2 3 3 Total sulfate and sulfamate groups per disaccharide Surface - bound ligand 500 1 , 000 1 , 500 2 , 000 – 100 0 100 200 300 500 1 , 000 1 , 500 2 , 000 – 100 0 100 200 300 0 0 Time ( s ) Time ( s ) R e s pon s e ( RU ) R e s pon s e ( RU ) PTPR σ K D = 17 nM LAR K D = 16 nM Analyte 100 200 300 400 500 0 50 100 150 300 400 100 200 0 50 100 200 300 400 0 50 100 200 300 400 0 50 100 200 300 400 500 0 50 Time ( s ) 100 300 400 0 50 200 Time ( s ) Time ( s ) Time ( s ) R e s pon s e ( RU ) Time ( s ) Time ( s ) R e s pon s e ( RU ) R e s pon s e ( RU ) R e s pon s e ( RU ) 24 26 25 Surface - bound ligand A na l y t e L A R R e s pon s e ( RU ) P T P R σ R e s pon s e ( RU ) d c b a 1 , 500 2 , 000 500 1 , 000 0 1 , 500 2 , 000 500 1 , 000 0 1 , 500 2 , 000 500 1 , 000 0 1 , 500 2 , 000 500 1 , 000 0 O NH HO OSO 3 HO O O 3 SO OH O 2 C O O 3 S O NH HO OSO 3 O O O 3 SO OH O 2 C O O 3 S O ( CH 2 ) 5 NH 2 28 Fig . 2 | Determination of the receptor - binding structures of sulfated glycans by SPR a , Direct interaction between PTPR σ or LAR and the synthetic biotinylated CS tetrasaccharides .

Consistent with the competition assay , all HS structures having at least one sul - fate / sulfamate group showed interaction with PTPR σ ( Fig . 2c ) , with higher O - sulfonation and N - sulfonation generally giving lower K D values in both monovalent and bivalent binding models ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . The interaction appeared saturated when more than two sulfate / sulfamate groups per disaccharide unit are present . No obvious impact of epimerization on binding could also be observed on comparison of 15 and 23 , which have the same sulfate / sulfamate group pattern but have mixed IdoA / GlcA and IdoA only backbones , respectively .

NATURe CHeMICAL BIOLOGY | VOL 15 | JULY 2019 | 699 – 709 | www . nature . com / naturechemicalbiology 705 Articles NaTuRE CHEmiCal Biology Activation of PTPR σ by CS - E tetrasaccharide . We next studied the impacts of these sugars on PTPR σ signaling . To determine its bulk phosphatase activity , PTPR σ was coexpressed with v - src tyrosine kinase cells in which the basal tyrosine phosphorylation level was increased . The cells were then treated with CS and HS oligosaccharides . Expression of PTPR σ alone slightly reduced the cellular phosphotyrosine levels detected by 4G10 monoclonal antibody ( Fig . 3a , third lane in the second blot ) . Treatment with dp4 or 29 ( a synthetic CS - E tetrasaccharide as methoxyphenyl glycoside , Fig . 1b ) 22 showed further reduction of phosphotyrosine levels ( Fig . 3a , fourth and fifth lanes in the second blot ) , suggest - ing that these tetrasaccharides activated PTPR σ possibly through monomerization ( Fig . 3b ) . Notably , the CS - E - enriched polysac - charides induced dephosphorylation , while heparin suppressed it ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . Subsequently , we constructed a chime - ric receptor ( named PTPR σ TK ) wherein the PTPR σ ectodomain ( ECD ) was fused to the intracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) ( Fig . 3c ) . Because the kinase activity of EGFR is activated by ligand - induced clustering of its ECD , acti - vation of PTPR σ TK should also reflect clustering of PTPR σ ( ECD ) . Thus , phosphorylation of the intracellular domain of EGFR allowed us to judge the extracellular state of PTPR σ as regulated by different ligands . PTPR σ TK was transiently expressed in cells , and the cells were treated with the same molar ratio of oligosaccharides . Both dp4 and 29 reduced the phosphorylation of EGFR at Y1173 , suggesting that these tetrasaccharides induced the monomerization of PTPR σ ( Fig . 3d ) . In contrast , the commercially acquired heparin octasaccharide fragments ( herein referred to as dp8 ) and the syn - thetic CS - E octasaccharide 30 ( ref . 24 ; Fig . 1b ) caused the clustering of PTPR σ as indicated by the increased phosphorylation of EGFR ( Fig . 3d ) . In the same chimeric receptor assay , phosphorylation was reduced by the CS - E - enriched polysaccharides and increased by heparin ( Supplementary Fig . 3b ) consistent with the aforemen - tioned observation . As pointed out by others 20 , the CS - E - enriched polysaccharides contain substantial amounts ( about 40 % ) of motifs other than CS - E . These other motifs probably limit the length of the consecutive CS - E disaccharide repeats in these natural polysac - charides such that effective clustering of PTPR σ does not occur . We found that PTPR σ TK - transfected cells showed better survival under serum - free conditions . This behavior could be reversed by tetrasaccharide 29 and the CS - E - enriched polysaccharides ( Fig . 3e , second and third graphs , respectively ) as well as the EGFR kinase inhibitors PD168393 and AG1478 ( Fig . 3e , first graph ) , supporting the idea that the tetrasaccharides dissociated PTPR σ TK and sup - pressed its EGFR activity . In the rat brain , the CS - E disaccharide unit accounts for approximately 3 % of the total CS disaccharides , while roughly 50 % of HS disaccharides have at least one hydroxy or amino moiety modified by sulfonation 25 , 26 . Consequently , we propose a model wherein CS and HS switch PTPR σ on and off , respectively . With only three CS - E disaccharide units probably present in a typical chain of around 100 disaccharide repeats , a short stretch of consecutive CS - E disaccharides up to hexasaccharide is possible in natural CS . Conversely , because O - sulfonated and N - sulfonated disaccharide repeats are prevalent in natural HS , long stretches of such structures are very likely . Thus , short and long stretches of the binding domain expected in natural CS and HS would mono - merize and cluster the receptors , respectively ( Supplementary Fig . 3c ) . The CS - E tetrasaccharide and HS octasaccharides bear - ing sulfate / sulfamate groups have comparable affinities to PTPR σ ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Table 1 ) . Bidirectional competition assay also demonstrated that CS - E tetrasaccharide ( 26 or 29 ) and HS octasaccharide ( 14 ) could effectively compete for binding to PTPR σ ( Supplementary Fig . 3d ) . These modes of action would lead to promotion or suppression of dystrophic endball formation and axonal regeneration . Disrupted autophagy in endballs . To reveal the significance of the RPTP binding to glycosaminoglycans , we focused on dystro - phic endballs , which are terminal structures closely associated with failure of axonal regeneration 13 , 27 . By tracing the corticospinal tract ( CST ) using biotinylated dextran amine after spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , we observed that most axon tips formed dystrophic endballs at the lesion ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . To understand their cellular mechanisms , we adopted an in vitro glial scar model established by Tom et al . 27 . When adult dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neurons were seeded on laminin , their axon tips formed growth cones , which advanced by approximately 0 . 1 mm over the 2 - h observation period ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Video 1 ) . When neurons were cultured on a gradient of the bovine CS - PG aggrecan , even though axons could invade the inner side of the aggrecan rim , their elongation was almost completely stopped by the gradient ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . The aggrecan contained roughly 0 . 2 % CS - E disaccharides ( Supplementary Table 2 ) , which could limit the stretch of possible CS - E repeats to the minimal length needed for PTPR σ binding ( for example , tetrasaccharide ) , considering that aggrecan carries 50 to 100 CS chains . Unlike growth cones , the dystrophic endballs did not exhibit any forward migration during the recording ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Video 2 ) . The axon tips on the aggrecan gradient transformed into club - like structures , which were quite similar to the drawings by Cajal 28 . Many vacuoles accumulated in dystrophic endballs but not in growth cones ( Fig . 4a , rightmost image ) . These vacuoles harbored double - membrane structures of less than 1 μ m in diameter , with contents exhibiting the same density as the cytosol ( Fig . 4b ) . In addition , the microtubule - associated protein 1 light chain 3 ( LC3 ) - positive puncta , a well - established marker for autophagosomes 29 , were more concentrated in dystrophic endballs than in growth cones ( Fig . 4c and Supplementary Fig . 4c ) . These data suggested that the said vacuoles are autophagosomes . There are two possible explanations for the accumulation of autophagosomes : ( 1 ) elevation of the basal level of autophagy or ( 2 ) disruption of autophagy flux especially at the fusion step between autophagosomes and lysosomes . To reveal the causes of autopha - gosomal accumulation , we introduced mRFP - GFP - LC3 ( tfLC3 ) , a marker for autophagy flux , to living neurons 30 . This fusion protein localizes in autophagosomes during autophagy , giving both green and red fluorescence ( seen as yellow , Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . After fusion with lysosomes , GFP is rapidly quenched by the acidic envi - ronment . Thus , autophagosomes and autolysosomes can be dis - tinguished by yellow and red colors , respectively . Approximately 70 % of autophagic vacuoles in growth cones were autolysosomes . In contrast , most autophagic vacuoles appeared yellow in dystro - phic endballs , indicating disrupted autophagy flux ( Fig . 4d and Supplementary Fig . 4e ) . Live imaging with expression of GFP - LC3 and the lysosomal marker mRFP - Lamp1 also gave similar results ( Fig . 4e and Supplementary Fig . 4f ) . It was previously reported that autolysosomes at axon tips were actively transported to the soma on microtubules 31 . In growth cones , we found that autophago - somes were retrogradely transported after fusion with lysosomes ( Supplementary Fig . 5 and Supplementary Video 3 ) . Conversely , autophagosomes in dystrophic endballs were stacked at the axon tips without fusion to lysosomes ( Supplementary Fig . 5 and Supplementary Video 4 ) . The motility of lysosomes was not altered in dystrophic endballs , confirming that the molecular transport was not necessarily affected . These results indicated that autophagy flux was severely disrupted at the fusion step between autophagosomes and lysosomes , causing the abnormal accumulation of autophago - somes in dystrophic endballs . Next , we asked whether autophagosomes would also accumu - late in vivo in dystrophic endballs . Spinal cord sections after a contusion SCI were prepared and stained with anti - LC3 antibody . CST axons stopped at the side rostral to the lesion where CS was NATURe CHeMICAL BIOLOGY | VOL 15 | JULY 2019 | 699 – 709 | www . nature . com / naturechemicalbiology 706 Articles NaTuRE CHEmiCal Biology enriched ( Fig . 4f ) . The tips of the regenerating stopping axons were swollen and contained many LC3 - positive puncta . We , therefore , conclude that the accumulation of autophagosomes is one of the common pathological features of dystrophic endballs , both in vitro and in vivo . Disrupted autophagy causes endballs . To determine whether disruption of autophagy flux is sufficient to induce dystrophic endballs , we knocked down Syntaxin17 , VAMP8 and SNAP29 , which are essential SNARE proteins for the formation of autolyso - somes 32 . Two efficient siRNAs for each gene were selected and used ( Supplementary Fig . 6a ) . Knocking down these three SNARE pro - teins in DRG neurons transformed the axon tips from growth cones to dystrophic endballs with accumulated LC3 - positive autopha - gosomes ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Axonal elongation was also significantly impaired in the knocked - down neurons ( Fig . 5c , d ) . To confirm these data , we treated DRG neurons on laminin with chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 , which prevented autolysosomal formation . These compounds significantly impaired axonal elongation , induc - ing club - like structures at the axon tips ( Fig . 5e and Supplementary Fig . 6b ) consistent with the previous result 33 . We also observed the accumulation of autophagosomes in these swollen structures ( Fig . 5f and Supplementary Fig . 6c ) . These results show that the disruption of autophagy flux is sufficient to induce a dystrophic endball - like structure . CS disrupts autophagy through PTPR σ . To examine the impact of the CS – PTPR σ interaction on autophagy flux , PTPR σ was tran - siently expressed in stable transfectants for mRFP - GFP - LC3 . In the control cells , almost all autophagic vacuoles were autolysosomes . Conversely , when PTPR σ - transfected cells were seeded on aggre - can ( Supplementary Fig . 7a , b ) , almost all autophagic vacuoles were autophagosomes , suggesting severe disruption of autophagy flux similar to that in dystrophic endballs . PTPR σ contains a wedge sequence at the N terminal region of the first catalytic domain . An exogenous peptide was shown to inhibit the catalytic activ - ity by homophilic binding to an endogenous sequence 34 and pro - moted functional recovery after SCI 35 . Indeed , the wedge peptide of PTPR σ promoted axonal regeneration in vitro ( Supplementary Fig . 7c – e ) . We tested whether the wedge peptide of PTPR σ would prevent the disruption of autophagy flux induced by CS . The wedge peptide achieved a greater rescue of autophagy flux compared to a TAT peptide control ( Supplementary Fig . 7f , g ) . To further test whether the phosphatase activity of PTPR σ was involved in dystro - phic endball formation , we constructed a phosphatase - dead mutant of PTPR σ ( PTPR σ ( ECD ) - HA ) in which the intracellular catalytic domains of PTPR σ were deleted ( Supplementary Fig . 7h ) 36 . The mutant was properly presented on the cell surface of transfected cells ( Supplementary Fig . 7i ) but did not show any phosphatase activity even in the presence of the monomerizing ligands dp4 and 29 ( Supplementary Fig . 7j ) . When introduced into dystrophic end - balls formed in an aggrecan gradient , PTPR σ ( ECD ) - HA allowed axonal penetration across the aggrecan rim ( Supplementary Fig . 7k , l ) , probably due to its dominant idle presence . These data demonstrate that the CS – PTPR σ interaction and the intracellular domain of PTPR σ are important to disrupt autophagy flux and promote dystrophic endball formation . More importantly , tetra - saccharide 29 showed a similar inhibitory effect on autophagy flux through PTPR σ ( Fig . 5g , h ) . Cortactin is a substrate for PTPR σ . Cortactin is an actin - binding protein , which undergoes several post - translational modifications including tyrosine phosphorylation . In particular , Y421 and Y466 phosphorylations are essential for its actin - binding activity 37 . Some population of Y421 - phosphorylated cortactin specifically localize to lysosomes 38 , providing an actin bridge that enables the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes . Indeed , knocking cortactin down resulted in inhibition of autolysosome formation and autophago - some accumulation 39 . Consistent with these previous works , we also found that genetic silencing of cortactin inhibited lysosomal quench of GFP - LC3 ( Supplementary Fig . 8a , b ) , confirming that cortactin is essential in autophagosome – lysosome fusion . Moreover , piv - otal roles of phosphorylated cortactin and its tyrosine kinase Src in elongating growth cones had been suggested previously 40 . Thus , we tested whether cortactin is a new substrate for PTPR σ . Purified cortactin was dephosphorylated at Y421 by the recombinant cata - lytic domain of PTPR σ ( Fig . 6a ) . Knockdown of PTPR σ resulted in increased levels of phosphorylated cortactin , suggesting that cor - tactin is a physiological substrate for PTPR σ ( Fig . 6b ) . In addition , overexpression of PTPR σ reduced the phosphorylation of cortactin in different cells ( Fig . 6c and Supplementary Fig . 8c ) , which was reinforced by the monomerizing ligand 29 and suppressed by the clustering ligand heparin ( Fig . 6c ) . Dystrophic endballs formed in the CS - PG aggrecan gradient showed reduced phosphorylated Y421 - cortactin signals compared to healthy growth cones on lam - inin ( Fig . 6d , e ) . Furthermore , the lentiviral knockdown of cortac - tin ( Supplementary Fig . 8d ) resulted in endball - like structures with accumulation of autophagosomes ( Fig . 6f , g ) and impaired axonal elongation ( Supplementary Fig . 8e , f ) . Hence , cortactin is a physi - ological target of PTPR σ and plays an indispensable role in dystro - phic endball formation and inhibition of axonal regeneration . Finally , we attempted to rescue the dystrophic endballs by using synthetic HS oligomers . Based on our competition binding assay , we selected octasaccharides 14 and 23 as representative HS com - pounds . Indeed , these two sugars , together with compound 12 , sub - stantially induced phosphorylation of PTPR σ TK ( Supplementary Fig . 9a ) and are potential drug candidates to cluster PTPR σ and suppress its phosphatase activity . As expected , 14 and 23 prevented the formation of dystrophic endballs in adult DRG neurons and facilitated their penetration across the gradient ( Supplementary Fig . 9b ) . Nearly half of the axons invading the aggrecan rim could pass the rim of the aggrecan gradient ( Supplementary Fig . 9c ) com - parable to the results when CS was digested by chondroitinase ABC ( Supplementary Fig . 9d ) . Discussion We successfully identified the binding domains of CS and HS required for interaction with their shared receptors PTPR σ and LAR . The synthetic CS and HS oligosaccharides with defined structures and length have vital roles in accomplishing this out - come . Together with previous reports , we introduce the concept that glycan sulfation patterns determine axonal fate after injury ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . It is likely that HS - PGs on the surface of axon tips cluster PTPR σ as the default state 13 , 16 . On injury , the axon tips are exposed to emerging CS - PGs that monomerize PTPR σ , which in turn leads to dephosphorylation of cortactin , disruption of autophagy flux , dystrophic endball formation and , ultimately , inhibition of axonal regeneration . Different types of sulfated glycosaminoglycan have been inde - pendently studied mainly based on their backbones . However , recent advances revealed their shared functions or shared interact - ing partners . Our results demonstrate that the sulfation patterns of these glycans rather than their backbone structures are more critical in some cases in tuning biological functions . These issues should be carefully addressed by future studies using the com - bined strategy of synthetic chemistry and genome editing . We also showed that synthetic HS octasaccharides can rescue axons fol - lowing inhibition of their elongation . Because these HS oligosac - charides can be imported into the CNS through the blood – brain barrier 41 and lack C - 3 sulfation , an important functionality for anticoagulation activity 16 , they might be potential drug candidates targeting traumatic CNS injury . NATURe CHeMICAL BIOLOGY | VOL 15 | JULY 2019 | 699 – 709 | www . nature . com / naturechemicalbiology 707 Articles NaTuRE CHEmiCal Biology Another important finding here is that an extrinsic signal , namely , CS and PTPR σ , locally disrupts autophagy flux . Neurons are terminally differentiated and highly polarized cells . Advancing growth cones are active structures with elevated turnover of cyto - skeletons and membranes . Therefore , it is reasonable that autophagy is active at the axon tips as reported previously 31 . Consistently , mice lacking basal autophagy in neurons develop neurodegeneration 42 , 43 . Accumulation of autophagosomes was observed in dystrophic syn - apses in human patients with Alzheimer’s disease 44 . Thus , some neurodegenerative diseases could be explained partly by intrin - sic defects in the autophagy machinery . Several lines of evidence implicated the pivotal roles of autophagy in axonal regeneration . For instance , autophagosomal accumulation in injured axon in rat model of optic nerve injury was demonstrated 45 . A similar phenom - enon was also observed in SCI model 46 . Furthermore , the forced induction of autophagy by Beclin - 1 peptide showed therapeutic effect after SCI 47 . However , the underlying cellular and molecu - lar mechanisms is unclear . Therefore , our present finding that an extrinsic signal induces a localized disruption of autophagy flux through PTPR σ is unexpected and provides insight into the mecha - nisms of traumatic nerve injury and neurodegenerative diseases . Of note , PTPR σ localizes phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate - positive autophagic vacuole during autophagy and positively regulates its early phase 48 . Thus , together with our current data , there might be cell - specific or context - dependent diverse roles of PTPR σ at several steps in autophagy . The downstream molecules to PTPR σ signaling has long been unclear . PTPR σ and LAR seem to have diverse and different sub - strates specificities 49 . By focusing on disruption of autophagy flux , we successfully identified cortactin as a substrate of PTPR σ . PTPR σ catalyzes the dephosphorylation of cortactin at Y421 in a ligand - dependent manner . More importantly , dystrophic endballs almost completely lack pY421 signals . The Src tyrosine kinase family , including Src and Fyn , are major kinases for cortactin 37 . They are highly enriched in the developing brain and elongat - ing axonal growth cones . It was also reported that loss of Src kinase activity resulted in impaired axonal elongation 50 . Thus , our current work would also suggest a probable mechanism of Src - mediated axonal elongation .

Cells were suspended in 400 μ l of ice - cold PBS , and run on FACS Calibur ( BD Bioscience ) to acquire at least 10 , 000 count event for each sample . Data was analyzed with CellQuestPro software ( BD Bioscience ) . Contusive SCI . Adult C57BL / 6J mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital ( 50 mg kg − 1 ) . After laminectomy at cervical level 7 ( C7 ) , the dura matter was exposed and contusive injury was induced with a force of 100 kilodynes by using an Infinite Horizon Impactor ( Precision Systems and Instrumentation ) , which can provide a consistent degree of contusive injury . All impacts induced contusive injury in the dorsal CST of the spinal cord . Anterograde tracing of the CST and histology . Mice were deeply anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital at 1 week after SCI operation . A 34 - gauge needle ( Terumo ) with a 10 % solution of biotinylated dextran amine ( BDA , 10 kDa ; Molecular Probes ) was stereotaxically inserted at four sites ( anterior – posterior axis : + 0 . 5 , 0 , − 0 . 5 , − 1 . 0 mm ; mediolateral axis : 1 . 5 mm ; depth : 0 . 5 mm ) per hemisphere of the mouse forelimb sensorimotor cortex . The BDA solution was injected by using an electrical pump at an injection rate of 0 . 25 μ l min − 1 . Two weeks later , to obtain spinal cord sections , the animals were transcardially perfused with PBS for 5 min followed by 4 % PFA / PBS for 10 min . The spinal cord was dissected and further fixed in the same fixative overnight at 4 °C . The tissues were immersed in 30 % ( w / v ) sucrose / PBS and stored overnight at 4 °C . The fixed and cryoprotected spinal cord tissues were embedded with optimal cutting temperature compound ( Sakura Finetek ) . Frozen sections of 20 μ m thickness were sagittally or transversely cut using a cryostat microtome , mounted on glass slides and used in the immunohistochemical study . Sections were washed three times with PBS and incubated in blocking solution consisting of 10 % BSA and 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 2 h at room temperature . After blocking , sections were incubated with 1 : 400 AlexaFluor647 conjugated streptavidin substrate ( Molecular Probes , S32357 ) diluted in 0 . 05 % ( v / v ) Tween20 in PBS overnight at 4 °C . After three washes , the sections were incubated with primary antibody diluted in 5 % BSA and 0 . 15 % Triton X - 100 in PBS overnight at 4 °C . The next day , the sections were incubated with Alexafluor - conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1 : 200 ; Molecular Probe ) . The primary antibodies used here were rabbit anti - LC3A / B ( 1 : 500 ; Cell Signaling Technology , 12741S ) and mouse anti - CS56 ( 1 : 200 ; Sigma , C8035 ) . Finally , after extensive washing with PBS , the sections were stained with 1 : 1 , 000 4 ’ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( Dojindo ) to visualize the cellular nucleus . Stained sections were observed and analyzed using an inverted confocal microscope ( Nikon ) . Images were analyzed using Photoshop CC software . Statistics and reproducibility .
