METHODOLOGY Open Access Variable - angle total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy of intact cells of Arabidopsis thaliana Yinglang Wan 1 , William M Ash III 2 , Lusheng Fan 1 , 3 , Huaiqin Hao 1 , Myung K Kim 2 and Jinxing Lin 1 * Abstract Background : Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) is a powerful tool for observing fluorescently labeled molecules on the plasma membrane surface of animal cells . However , the utility of TIRFM in plant cell studies has been limited by the fact that plants have cell walls , thick peripheral layers surrounding the plasma membrane . Recently , a new technique known as variable - angle epifluorescence microscopy ( VAEM ) was developed to circumvent this problem . However , the lack of a detailed analysis of the optical principles underlying VAEM has limited its applications in plant - cell biology . Results : Here , we present theoretical and experimental evidence supporting the use of variable - angle TIRFM in observations of intact plant cells . We show that when total internal reflection occurs at the cell wall / cytosol interface with an appropriate angle of incidence , an evanescent wave field of constant depth is produced inside the cytosol . Results of experimental TIRFM observations of the dynamic behaviors of phototropin 1 ( a membrane receptor protein ) and clathrin light chain ( a vesicle coat protein ) support our theoretical analysis . Conclusions : These findings demonstrate that variable - angle TIRFM is appropriate for quantitative live imaging of cells in intact tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana . Keywords : Quantitative , VA - TIRFM , optical analysis , intact cell , cell wall Background Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) , also known as evanescent wave microscopy ( EWM ) , is a powerful tool for observing the distribution and movement of fluorescently labeled molecules in an aqueous environment . This technique can be used when the molecules of interest are very close to the boundary between the aqueous environment and another medium with a higher refractive index ( n ) . It is based on the phy - sical phenomenon of total internal reflection ( TIR ) , which occurs when a ray of light strikes a boundary between two materials with different n values and the incident angle ( θ i ) is greater than the critical angle of incidence ( θ c ) [ 1 ] . Under these conditions , all of the light is reflected back into the medium with the higher n value ( Formula 1 ) [ 1 ] . When TIR occurs , a nearfield light wave forms at the boundary ; this “ evanescent wave ” ( EW ) can penetrate the surface of the medium to a depth ( d ) approximately equal to 1 / 3 of the wave - length of the incident light ( Formula 2 ) [ 1 ] . Formula for calculating critical angle of incidence : θ c = sin − 1 (cid:2) n 1 / n 2 (cid:3) ( 1 ) Formula for calculating the depth of an EW field : d = λ 0 / 4 π (cid:2) n 2 2 sin 2 θ − n 1 2 (cid:3) − 1 / 2 ( 2 ) The TIRFM can provide a few hundred nanometers of excitation volume near the plasma membrane ; this fea - ture is particularly useful because the excitation volume is the site of many important events associated with the plasma membrane . TIRFM provides a higher spatial reso - lution and a higher signal - to - noise ratio than classic fluorescence microscopy or laser scanning confocal * Correspondence : linjx @ ibcas . ac . cn 1 Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology , Institute of Botany , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100093 , China Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Wan et al .

When equipped with an electron - multiplier charge - coupled device ( EM - CCD ) , the instru - ment can provide reliable imaging even with weak signals and a short exposure time . Therefore , the EM - CCD / TIRFM combination is a viable solution for laboratories ; it provides high spatial and temporal resolution for studying events occurring near the plasma membrane [ 2 - 4 ] . Because the TIRFM technique is unrivaled in its ima - ging capability in the near - boundary field , it has been successfully applied to in vivo studies of animal cells for the past decade [ 3 , 4 ] . However , the thick cell wall that surrounds the cytoplasm of plant cells has cast doubt on the possible utility of TIRFM in plant cell studies [ 5 , 6 ] . Recently , a new technique known as variable - angle epi - fluorescence microscopy ( VAEM ) was developed to cir - cumvent this problem . The technique allows laser light to penetrate the cell wall using a sub - critical angle in which θ i is slightly smaller than θ c [ 7 ] , and it has been used successfully in studies of the membrane physiology of plant cells [ 8 , 9 ] . However , because VAEM provides a relatively deep illumination field of variable depth , it is sometimes referred to as pseudo - TIRFM [ 5 ] . In the present study , we coupled our TIRFM equip - ment to a device that was used to vary θ i . Using this tech - nique of variable - angle TIRFM ( VA - TIRFM ) , we were able to observe the dynamic and endocytotic behaviors of green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged plant membrane proteins in living Arabidopsis thaliana cells . The specific membrane proteins examined were phototropin 1 ( PHOT1 ; a photoreceptor protein ) and clathrin light chain ( CLC ; an endosomal vesicle coat protein ) . During our experiments , we observed that PHOT1 - GFP and CLC - GFP both exhibited two different modes of dynamic behavior , a lateral - movement mode and a blinking mode respectively . Observation of the blinking mode occurred only with true TIRFM , which provides an EW field with a constant depth of illumination . Therefore , we carried out an optical analysis to explain this experimental phe - nomenon and investigated whether VA - TIRFM will prove useful in the quantitative analysis of membrane - associated proteins in intact plant cells . Results and discussion Optical analysis of plant peripheral layers and limitations of VAEM in plant - cell studies To analyze the optical principles underlying our fluores - cence observations of plant cells , we first examined the peripheral layers around the plant cytosol . Unlike micro - scopic observations of animal cells ( Figure 1A ) , micro - scopic observations of plant cells ( Figure 1B ) must accommodate five different peripheral layers between the incident light and the cytosol ( n = 1 . 38 ) ; these layers are the immersion oil ( n = 1 . 52 ) , glass cover slip ( n = 1 . 52 ) , aqueous medium ( n = 1 . 33 ) , cell wall ( n = 1 . 42 to 1 . 48 ) , and plasma membrane ( d = 7 nm ) [ 1 , 10 ] . This complex optical layering causes two major difficulties in the application of TIRFM technology to plant cell stu - dies . First , because the aqueous layer between the cell wall and the cover slip has the smallest refraction index of these peripheral layers , the interface between the glass and the aqueous medium ( g / am interface ) has the smallest θ c of all the interfaces ( Figure 2A ) . Second , because the cell wall is quite thick ( > 200 nm ) [ 11 ] , the depth of the EW field ( ~ 100 nm ) is insufficient to pene - trate this thick boundary when TIR occurs at the g / am interface ( Figure 2A ) . VAEM solves these problems by creating a sub - critical angle of incidence , resulting in a narrow illumination field inside cytosol Figure 1D and 2B ) [ 7 ] . According to Formula 1 , θ c at the g / am interface is 61 . 0° . The angle of refraction ( δ ) inside the cytosol for a sub - critical angle of incidence ( θ i < θ c ) can be calculated using Snell ’ s law ( Formulas 3 and 4 ) . With the n values given above for cytosol and glass and θ i set at 60 . 0° ( slightly less than θ c ) , then δ is 72 . 5° inside the cytosol . The depth of the illumination field from the refractive laser light can then be calculated by a trigonometric for - mula ( Formula 5 ) . Snell ’ s law describes the relationship between θ i and δ as : sin θ i / sin δ = n 2 / n 1 ( 3 ) When incident light penetrates × different optical layers , δ in the last medium ( δ x ) can be calculated as : sin θ i / sin δ x = n x / n 1 ( 4 ) Variable depth of illumination ( d ) within an observa - tion field ( width = a ) can be calculated as : d = a / tan δ x ( 5 ) In our experimental set - up , the observation field of the EM - CCD camera is 512 × 512 pixels , equivalent to 81 . 9 × 81 . 9 μ m ( a = 81 . 9 μ m ) ; thus , according to For - mula 5 , d can vary from 0 to 25 . 9 μ m in this field ( Fig - ure 2B and 2E ) . Given that the width of a single cell is 20 μ m , d can vary from 0 to 6 . 3 μ m . This theoretical result is consistent with the experimental results reported by Konopka et al . , who used VAEM to observe GFP - tagged CLC and the GFP - tagged microtubule - bind - ing domain in intact plant cells ; they determined that the depth of the VAEM observation ranged from a few microns to approximately 40 microns [ 7 ] . Therefore , we have designated this illumination field as the variable - angle epifluorescence ( VAE ) field ( Figure 1D ) , distinct from the EW field associated with TIRFM ( Figure 1C ) . Wan et al . Plant Methods 2011 , 7 : 27 http : / / www . plantmethods . com / content / 7 / 1 / 27 Page 2 of 7 The narrow and constant EW illumination field is the major advantage of the TIRFM technique over laser scan - ning or spinning - disc confocal microscopy [ 3 ] . On the other hand , VAEM does not exceed these techniques in spatial resolution and is markedly limited in its usefulness for observations of intact plant cells because the variable illumination depth prevents accurate quantitation . The observed molecules do not maintain a constant dynamic state between different observations or among the differ - ent regions in a single observation with a variable illumi - nation depth . In contrast , true TIRFM can be used to quantitatively measure the protein docking time on the plasma membrane [ 12 ] and to analyze the oligomeric states of membrane proteins in animal cells [ 13 ] . Thus , VAEM is inferior to true TIRFM ; the disadvantages out - lined above limit its suitability for studies of protein dynamics and behaviors in plant cell membranes . “ Frustrated ” TIR and EW field in intact plant cells Another major difference between plant and animal cells is that unlike migrating animal cells , plant cells do not adhere to glass surfaces . Thus , an aqueous film of varying thickness is present between the glass surface and the cell wall . When laser light strikes the g / am interface with θ i > θ c , and the aqueous film is sufficiently thin ( h < 1 / 5 l ; approximately 100 nm ) , the tail of the evanescent wave transmits most of the light into the next medium so that only a small part of the light energy is reflected back ; this phenomenon has been dubbed “ frustrated ” TIR ( fTIR ) [ 14 ] . After calculating the altered θ c and the loss of energy in the fTIR situation , Ash et al . used TIR holographic microscopy to examine onion epidermal cells attached to a glass surface [ 15 ] . Their analysis suggested that laser light can penetrate the aqueous medium even when θ i > θ c . The critical factor for the fTIR phenomenon is a suf - ficiently thin aqueous film . As shown in Figure 2C and 2D , a laser light beam can penetrate the aqueous medium under fTIR conditions . Thus , the first major obstacle to the application of TIRFM to plant - cell studies is overcome . If we consider the n values of the different peripheral layers in plant cell microscopy , we see that TIR may occur at two different interfaces , the cell wall / cytoplasm ( cw / c ) interface and the glass / cell wall ( g / cw ) interface . Given that the average n of cell walls is 1 . 45 [ 10 ] and that cell walls of outer epi - dermal cells are smooth and of constant thickness ( roughly 250 nm ) [ 11 ] , θ c at the cw / c interface ( θ c ( cw / c ) ) is 72 . 1° . According to Snell ’ s law ( Formula 3 ) , θ i from the objective lens ( θ c1 in Figure 2C and 2E ) should be greater than 65 . 2° to create TIR at the cw / c interface . When θ i is further increased by the variable angle device and reaches θ c at the g / cw interface ( θ c ( g / cw ) = 72 . 5° ) , the light beam is completely reflected back ( θ c2 in Figure 2D ) . Again , the EW field cannot reach the cytosol in an intact cell . There are two critical requirements to obtain EW field illumina - tion inside the cytosol in an intact plant cell : an incident angle between θ c1 and θ c2 ( 65 . 2° < θ i < 72 . 5° ) and a suffi - ciently thin aqueous film ( d < 100 nm ) . When the EW Figure 1 Peripheral boundaries around animal and plant cells . ( A ) Schematic model of peripheral boundaries around an animal cell migrating on a glass surface .

Cell walls can be removed through enzymatic digestion to create protoplasts , “ naked ” plant cells that provide another approach for obtaining EW field illumination inside the plant cell cytosol . When protoplasts are tightly attached to a glass surface , the EW field can penetrate into the cytosol in a manner similar to that in TIRFM observation of animal cells ( Figure 1C ) . However , the preparation of protoplasts seems likely to affect the organization of at least some membrane and cytoskeletal proteins [ 16 , 17 ] , limiting the usefulness of protoplasts in physiological studies . EW and VAE field observations of PHOT1 - GFP and CLC - GFP in intact plant cells To test our theoretical analysis of EW and VAE field observation , we performed TIRFM and VAEM experi - ments . The results were unambiguous and reproducible . For example , when we examined GFP - tagged PHOT1 or CLC in transgenic Arabidopsis cells using VA - TIRFM , Figure 2 Optical analysis of light paths in VAEM and TIRFM observations in plant cells . ( A ) When the aqueous film between the cover glass and the cell wall is thick ( > 100 nm ) and θ i is greater than 61 . 0° ( θ c ) , all light energy is reflected at the g / am interface . The EW field forms in the aqueous medium but cannot penetrate into the cytosol . ( B ) When θ i is less than 61 . 0° ( θ c ) , a VAE field forms , illuminating the cytosol with variable depth . Angles of refraction for all optical boundaries with θ i = 60 . 0° are shown . ( C ) When the aqueous film is sufficiently thin ( < 100 nm ) , and θ i is smaller than θ c for g / cw ( θ c2 ) but greater than θ c for g / c ( θ c1 ) [ ( i . e . , θ c1 < θ i < θ c2 ) ] , an EW field of constant depth is created inside the cytosol at the cw / c interface . ( D ) When θ i > θ c2 , the light is completely reflected at the cell wall interface , and the EW field is not deep enough to penetrate into the cytosol . ( E ) Optical parameters of plant - cell peripheral boundaries . In the situation shown in ( A ) , the EW field is 105 nm deep and cannot penetrate the cell wall . In the situation shown in ( C ) and with θ i = 67 . 0° , the EW field penetrates 159 nm into the cytosol .

Plant Methods 2011 , 7 : 27 http : / / www . plantmethods . com / content / 7 / 1 / 27 Page 4 of 7 we observed two different dynamic modes : a lateral - movement mode ( Figure 3A and 3B ) , additional movie files show this mode in more detail ( see Additional file 1 and 2 online ) ; and a blinking mode ( Figure 3C and 3D ) , additional movie files show this mode in more detail ( see Additional file 3 and 4 online ) . Because a uniformly pre - sent blinking mode can only be observed in an EW field with a constant depth of illumination , our observation of a blinking mode was a true - TIRFM observation . ( Actu - ally , it was this original observation that prompted us to analyze the optical characteristics of the peripheral layers in plant - cell microscopy . In turn , these theoretical ana - lyses of the fTIR phenomenon have supported our TIRFM observations in intact plant tissues ) . PHOT1 is a membrane - associated receptor of blue light that localizes on the peripheral membrane of hypocotyl cortical and epidermal cells [ 18 ] . In 4 - day - old dark - grown seedlings , PHOT1 - GFP is found on the plasma membrane , but exposure to blue light initiates its internalization by activating its functional domains [ 18 , 19 ] . In our experi - ments , we found that the lateral - movement mode of PHOT1 - GFP was observable only after a 3 - 5 - min period of blue laser illumination ( Figure 3A and Additional file 1 online ) , suggesting that the PHOT1 - GFP spots moving lat - erally were blue - light - induced PHOT1 - GFP endosomes moving inside the cell near the plasma membrane ( i . e . , in the VAE field ) . When we changed the θ i so that θ c1 < θ i < θ c2 ( Figure 2C ) and gently pressed the seedling against the surface of the glass slide , we observed a typical TIRFM image showing blinking behavior of the labeled protein ( Figure 3C and Additional file 3 online ) . This finding confirms the theo - retical analysis above , showing that with a sufficiently thin water film and a carefully adjusted θ i , membrane receptor proteins can also be observed in the EW field ( Figure 2C ) . In comparing the dynamic modes of PHOT1 - GFP molecules , we found that the PHOT1 - GFP spots exhibiting lateral movement were both more numerous and more intense than those exhibiting blink - ing behavior . This observation suggested that some of the PHOT1 - GFP was assembled in early endosomes or the trans - Golgi network , whereas the PHOT1 - GFP in the plasma membrane was distributed as monomers or dimers ( Kaiserli et al . 2009 ) . Together , these observations of PHOT1 - GFP provide solid evidence supporting our current functional model of VA - TIRFM observation in intact plant cells ( Figure 2C ) . This functional model was also confirmed by our observations of the dynamic modes of CLC - GFP in an intact Arabidopsis seedling . CLC molecules normally assemble together with clathrin heavy chains to form a “ cage ” that coats endosomal vesicles [ 20 ] . The docking time of CLC - GFP signals at the plasma membrane may reflect the maturation phase of clathrin - coated pits [ 12 , 21 ] . Because many CLC - GFP molecules interact dur - ing cage assembly on the plasma membrane , whereas PHOT1 exists only as monomers and dimers on the plasma membrane [ 19 , 20 ] , the CLC - GFP and PHOT1 - GFP spots were expected to be of different sizes and to reflect different dynamic behaviors ( Figure 3 ) . Nonethe - less , as we observed for PHOT1 - GFP , CLC - GFP also exhibited both blinking and lateral - movement modes . Interestingly , the blinking mode ( arrowheads in Figure 3B ) and the lateral - movement mode ( arrows in Figure 3B ) were both observed in the same visual field ( Addi - tional file 2 online ) , indicating a highly variable depth for the VAE field . In the regions with more shallow illu - mination , most of the CLC - GFP spots were blinking , with only a few laterally moving spots present in the same cell ( Figure 3B , left ) . In the regions with deep illu - mination fields , more laterally moving CLC - GFP spots were found ( Figure 3B , right ) . In contrast , when cells were observed in a constant EW field , no laterally mov - ing spots were detected in the entire visual field ( Figure 3D and Additional file 4 online ) . Taken together , these experimental results constitute strong evidence that Figure 3 PHOT1 - GFP and CLC - GFP fluorescence observations by VAEM and TIRFM . Still images taken from time - lapse sequences indicate localization of PHOT1 - GFP ( A and C ) and CLC - GFP ( B and D ) in hypocotyl epidermal cells of 4 - day - old Arabidopsis seedlings . Observations were made using VAEM ( A , B ) or TIRFM ( C , D ) observations . GFP - labeled pits in lateral - movement mode are indicated by arrows , and those in blinking mode are indicated by arrowheads . The shaded wedge in ( B ) indicates the trend of changing depth of VAE field illumination .

Plant Methods 2011 , 7 : 27 http : / / www . plantmethods . com / content / 7 / 1 / 27 Page 5 of 7 true - TIRFM observations can be made in intact plant cells . Therefore , these observations are a valid basis for quantitative analyses . Conclusions Our theoretical analyses and experimental results demon - strate that the θ i selected on VA - TIRFM equipment and the firmness of attachment of intact seedlings to the glass cover slip affect the type of observation of GFP - tagged membrane proteins that is made . Observation of lateral movement indicates VAEM , whereas observation of blink - ing behavior indicates a true TIRFM ( EWM ) . These two clearly distinguishable results support the validity of quan - titative analysis of VA - TIRFM results . Trajectory - tracking methods [ 22 - 24 ] can be used with VA - TIRFM to record the parameters of molecule movement , such as velocity and mean square displacement , allowing their roles in cel - lular trafficking and signaling processes to be analyzed . Furthermore , fluctuation in the observed fluorescence intensity might reflect movement through early endosomes or the trans - Golgi network from the plasma membrane [ 25 ] . Analyses of attachment time and photobleaching of blinking spots can be used to quantitatively determine the attachment mode , endocytosis rate , and oligomeric states of membrane - attached proteins [ 13 , 25 , 26 ] . Methods Plant material The Arabidopsis seedlings expressing PRE PHOT1 : : PHOT1 - GFP in the phot1 - 5 background [ 27 ] and PRE CLC : : CLC - GFP in WT ( Col - 0 ) background [ 8 ] were observed in this study . The seeds were sterilized and planted on the surface of 0 . 4 % phytagel ® ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO . USA ) medium with 1 / 2 MS basal salts ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and 1 % sucrose ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . The seedlings were put in the chamber with illumination from white fluorescence lamps with 7000 - 10000 lux of illuminance for 16 hours per day at a temperature of 22°C . VA - TIRFM setup and observation An objective - type TIR fluorescence microscope was built using an inverted microscope ( IX - 71 , Olympus ) equipped with a 100× oil - immersion objective lens ( numerical aper - ture = 1 . 45 ) and a diode laser ( Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics Tech . Co . , Ltd . , Changchun , China ) for illumination of objects through an adjustable - angle inter - nal reflective fluorescence illuminator . GFP - tagged mole - cules were excited by a 471 nm laser , respectively , and fluorescence signals were collected by the objective . Signals were filtered through either an FF01 - 525 / 45 - 25 band - pass filter ( Semrock , Lake Forest , Illinois , USA ) and then directed using a back - illuminated EM - CCD camera ( ANDOR iXon DV8897D - CS0 - VP , Andor Technology plc . , Belfast , Northern Ireland ) . The Micro - Manager program ( version 1 . 3 ; open source software developed by the Vale Lab at the University of California , San Francisco , CA , USA ) was used to operate the equipment . For sample preparation , Arabidopsis seedlings were immersed in half - strength Murashige and Skoog liquid medium on a cover glass ( BRAND Gmbh , Wertheim , Germany ; n , 1 . 52 ± 0 . 01 ; thickness , 0 . 13 - 0 . 17 mm ) . Another cover glass was placed on top of the sample , and this sandwich was pressed gently to tightly attach the seedling to the glass surface .
