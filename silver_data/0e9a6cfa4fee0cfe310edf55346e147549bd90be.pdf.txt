Core CTD content ( chemical - gene , chemical - disease and gene - disease interactions manually curated from the literature ) are integrated with each other as well as with select ex - ternal datasets to generate expanded networks and predict novel associations . Today , core CTD includes more than 30 . 5 million toxicogenomic connections relating chemicals / drugs , genes / proteins , diseases , taxa , Gene Ontology ( GO ) annotations , pathways , and gene interaction modules . In this update , we re - port a 33 % increase in our core data content since 2015 , describe our new exposure module ( that har - monizes exposure science information with core tox - icogenomic data ) and introduce a novel dataset of GO - disease inferences ( that identify common molec - ular underpinnings for seemingly unrelated patholo - gies ) . These advancements centralize and contex - tualize real - world chemical exposures with molecu - lar pathways to help scientists generate testable hy - potheses in an effort to understand the etiology and mechanisms underlying environmentally inﬂuenced diseases . INTRODUCTION The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database ( CTD ; http : / / ctdbase . org ) is a public resource for toxicogenomic infor - mation manually curated from the peer - reviewed scientific literature , providing key information about the interactions of environmental chemicals with gene products and their ef - fect on human disease ( 1 – 4 ) . CTD is curated by professional biocurators who leverage controlled vocabularies , ontolo - gies and structured notation to code a triad of core interac - tions describing chemical - gene , chemical - disease and gene - disease relationships ( 5 ) , which are then internally inte - grated to generate inferred chemical - gene - disease networks . These data are further associated with external data sets to establish novel , statistically ranked inferences between di - verse types of information ( 6 – 7 ) . Additionally , as part of our continued , active engagement with the scientific com - munity , CTD plays a significant role in advancing text - mining methods for biomedical information as part of the BioCreative consortium ( 8 – 12 ) , facilitates the development of semantic standards for the environmental health science community ( 13 ) , complies with reporting standards set by the BioSharing Information Resources ( 14 ) and is a regis - tered member ( https : / / biosharing . org / biodbcore - 000173 ) of BioDBcore ( 15 ) . Here , we provide our biennial database update , most no - tably highlighting our newly released exposure science mod - ule , which harmonizes and integrates data on chemical ex - posures into CTD’s broader biological framework ( 16 ) . Ex - posure science plays an important role in evaluating exper - imental toxicity data , developing risk assessments and in - forming public health policy ( 17 ) . Centralization of human exposure information is critical to assessing the ‘exposome’ , defined as the cumulative measure of an individual’s expo - sure since birth ( 18 ) . As well , the exposome complements genome research by recording and measuring the environ - mental component with which genes interact to determine one’s phenotype ( 18 ) . CTD’s new exposure science module provides investigators with a centralized resource for mak - ing connections between real - world environmental chem - ical measurements and laboratory - derived toxicogenomic data . This new feature , as well as other updates described herein , further expands the utility of CTD for environmen - tal health research . * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

This represents a 33 % increase in chemical - gene - disease interactions since our last update ( 4 ) . CTD also integrates manually curated data to generate predictive inferences ( 6 , 7 ) ; for example , if chemical A interacts with gene B , and independently gene B is associated with disease C , then chemical A is inferred to have a relationship with disease C ( via gene B ) . Inter - nal integration of core data generated more than 19 . 7 mil - lion inferred gene - disease relationships and 1 . 8 million in - ferred chemical - disease relationships , which are statistically ranked ( 7 ) . Finally , integration with external annotations from GO ( 19 ) , KEGG ( 20 ) , Reactome ( 21 ) and BioGRID ( 22 ) yields additional inferred relationships ( Table 1 ) . In to - tal , more than 30 . 5 million toxicogenomic connections are now freely available for analysis and hypothesis develop - ment . Aside from our own public web application ( PWA ) , CTD research and curated content is disseminated further into the scientific community in a number of important ways . First , at least 72 external resources now include and dis - play CTD information as part of their own databases , a 44 % increase from the 50 sources since our last re - port ( http : / / ctdbase . org / about / publications / # use ) . Second , in conjunction with Pfizer scientists , we developed ToxE - valuator , a proprietary tool that integrates CTD chemical - gene - disease relationships with other diverse ( public and private ) datasets into a single , web - based platform to aid Pfizer scientists in generating mechanistic toxicity - related hypotheses ( 23 ) . Finally , CTD continues its commitment to spearhead and advance biomedical text - mining research for the scientific community by teaming with the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) to orga - nize a BioCreative community challenge which focused on developing tools to identify and extract specific disease and chemical content ( 11 ) . For this endeavor , we helped develop a large corpus of manually curated annotations for chemicals , diseases and their interactions from 1500 PubMed articles ( 12 ) ; this corpus is freely available ( down - load by clicking : http : / / sourceforge . net / projects / bioc / files / CDR Data . zip / download ) , as are many of the associated text - mining tools developed by the 25 teams that partici - pated . New CTD exposure science module Most notably , since our last update , CTD has released a new exposure module ( 16 ) . This component was devel - oped in response to the community’s need for a centralized database that curates and harmonizes the real - world mea - surements and biological effects of environmental chemi - cals ( e . g . air pollutants , pesticides , heavy metals , polychlori - Figure 1 . Integration of exposure data curation into CTD framework . Core CTD is composed of interactions between chemicals , genes , diseases , Gene Ontology ( GO ) terms and pathway annotations ( colored circles in top diagram ) . In March 2015 , CTD released an exposure science mod - ule ( light orange circle in top diagram ) . For this paradigm , CTD manu - ally curates exposure statements ( bottom light blue box , with light orange categories connected by black lines ) describing how environmental stres - sors interact with human receptors during an exposure event to result in an exposure outcome . This curation paradigm uses many of the same con - trolled vocabularies as those used in core CTD to allow seamless data inte - gration and connectivity between the two projects : exposure stressors are chemicals ( blue arrow ) ; exposure events report biomarker measurements for chemicals ( blue arrow ) and proteins ( green arrow ) ; and exposure out - comes can be either altered phenotypes ( defined as GO terms , gray arrow ) or diseases ( red arrow ) . nated biphenyls , inter alia ) and human biomarkers incurred by such exposure . Working with the exposure science community , CTD de - veloped a novel manual curation paradigm ( 16 ) using the exposure ontology as its foundation ( 24 ) . In this module , CTD biocurators annotate over 35 data fields to four main categories that collectively form an exposure statement . A statement relates how an exposure stressor interacts with a human exposure receptor during an exposure event to re - sult in an exposure outcome ( Figure 1 ) . An integral fea - ture of this curation paradigm is that we use many of the same controlled vocabularies when curating chemical - gene - disease interactions for core CTD ( 5 , 16 ) . Thus , chem - D974 Nucleic Acids Research , 2017 , Vol . 45 , Database issue Table 1 .

This curation strategy provides three important advantages . First , it al - lows heterogeneous exposure information from different ar - ticles published by different laboratories in different jour - nals over the decades to become standardized and central - ized into a single repository , facilitating connections be - tween unique studies . Second , it brings exposure science data into the broader CTD framework , allowing both expo - sure data to leverage CTD curated knowledge and also al - lowing core CTD to help inform exposure analysis . Finally , the use of controlled vocabularies transforms complex , in - terdependent exposure incidents into modular data , allow - ing exposure information to be sorted , filtered and viewed from a variety of perspectives ( such as geographical location and receptor type ) . The manually curated exposure data are displayed on two new tabs on CTD’s PWA : ‘Exposure Studies’ ( provid - ing a summary of each exposure article ) and ‘Exposure Details’ ( providing detailed biomarker measurements ) , on all relevant Chemical , Gene , Disease , GO and Reference pages . Additionally , investigators can use CTD’s new ex - posure study query page ( http : / / ctdbase . org / query . go ? type = expStudies ) to quickly retrieve information aggregated at the study ( research article ) level ( Figure 2A ) using param - eters for a chemical stressor ( e . g . ‘air pollutants’ ) , the type of human receptor studied ( e . g . ‘study subjects’ ) and a geo - graphic location ( e . g . ‘United States’ ) . Select terms ( chemi - cals , genes , diseases , GO and references ) returned in the re - sult page are hyperlinked to their corresponding pages in CTD ( Figure 2B ) , allowing users to seamlessly explore ad - ditional associated information . The real - world measurements of exposure biomarkers are found under the ‘Details’ link on an ‘Exposure Stud - ies’ page or can be viewed in toto on the ‘Exposure De - tails’ data - tab for a chemical - of - interest ( Figure 3 ) . This lat - ter option aggregates the data from the germane articles in CTD , providing users with a landscape view of expo - sure measurements and outcomes from the published lit - erature . As well , an ‘Exposure Details’ query page is also available ( http : / / ctdbase . org / query . go ? type = expDetails ) to retrieve records at the highly granular exposure statement level . In July 2016 , CTD included more than 70 600 man - ually curated exposure statements for 803 chemicals , 153 biomarker genes , 301 diseases and 181 phenotypes ( GO - BP terms ) from over 1250 exposure scientific articles ( Figure 2C ) . Exposure data is also freely available to users in down - load files ( http : / / ctdbase . org / downloads / # exposureevents ) . New availability of GO - Disease inferences Over the last decade ( 4 ) , CTD has successfully generated novel connections between different types of data by inte - grating diverse information through a common intermedi - ate ( 1 , 6 , 7 ) . For example , if gene A is annotated to GO bi - ological process term B ( by GO annotators ) , and , indepen - dently , gene A is also associated with disease C ( by CTD biocurators ) , then GO term B can be inferred to disease C ( via gene A ) ( Figure 4A ) . These GO - disease inferences help users discover common molecular , biological and cellular events shared among seemingly unrelated diseases ( Figure 4B ) . The availability of this novel dataset ( 27 ) can be lever - aged in numerous ways , including discovering potential co - morbidities ( especially in exposure science ) , possible new treatment options by repositioning pharmaceutical drugs or identifying possible side effects . CTD’s files for GO - Disease - Gene Inference Networks are freely available ( http : / / ctdbase . org / downloads / # godiseasegenes ) and in July 2016 included more than 795 000 inferences between over 15 700 GO terms and 4200 diseases . Disease mappings and link - outs Since 2006 , CTD has maintained and used MEDIC as a practical vocabulary for curation of disease information ( 25 ) . MEDIC was created by merging disease terms from Nucleic Acids Research , 2017 , Vol . 45 , Database issue D975 Figure 2 . CTD’s new exposure curation content . ( A ) CTD’s new ‘Exposure Studies’ query page ( http : / / ctdbase . org / query . go ? type = expStudies ) allows users to retrieve study information using a variety of search parameters , including exposure chemical stressor ( e . g . air pollutants , blue circle ) , receptor description ( e . g . study subjects ) and countries ( e . g . the USA ) as the study location ( blue arrows ) . ( B ) The results display curated exposure studies meeting the query parameters ( highlighted in yellow ) with integrated links to any mentioned genes , chemicals , diseases , phenotypes ( GO - BP terms ) and source references ( blue dotted boxes with orange callout labels ) . The ‘Author’s Summary’ column provides the take - home point of each study , and the ‘Details’ link in the ‘Measurements’ column takes the user to the specific assay measurements . As well , all exposure content is reciprocally displayed on the aforementioned pages ( i . e . gene , chemical , disease , phenotype and source references ) , making the information seamlessly integrated into the broader biological context of the CTD framework . ( C ) Data status for CTD exposure module as of July 2016 includes over 70 600 manually curated statements from more than 1250 references ( updated monthly at : http : / / ctdbase . org / about / dataStatus . go ) . the flat list of the OMIM resource ( 28 ) with two Medical Subject Heading ( MeSH ) disease hierarchies ( 29 ) to pro - duce an extensive , navigable vocabulary . While originally intended to be only a placeholder until a more sophisti - cated disease resource emerged , MEDIC has proven to be remarkably successful , convenient and adaptable , and has been incorporated by many systems ( 30 – 34 ) . In 2015 , CTD began analyzing and comparing the disease terms and hi - erarchical structure used in MEDIC against the newly es - tablished Disease Ontology ( DO ) ( 35 ) , in an effort to co - ordinate MEDIC with this new resource . A single , robust , community - accepted disease vocabulary would be valuable for synchronizing the vast arrays of different biological databases . Toward that end , CTD is coordinating with the DO staff to find ways that MEDIC could help inform DO , and vice versa . As a first step , CTD now provides direct web links between 3 , 258 MEDIC disease terms to 2 , 943 equiv - alent terms in DO , based upon common MeSH accession identification numbers shared between the two vocabular - ies . Ultimately , bidirectional cross - links between MEDIC and DO will enable greater interoperability and data shar - ing for the entire scientific community . FUTURE DIRECTIONS Since 2004 , CTD has evolved from a fledgling database to an extensive public resource with over 30 . 5 million toxi - cogenomic relationships ( Table 1 ) . We will continue to ex - pand our core and exposure curation modules with new data content added every month ( http : / / ctdbase . org / about / dataStatus . go ) . D976 Nucleic Acids Research , 2017 , Vol . 45 , Database issue Figure 3 . Landscape view of real - world measurements and outcomes curated for exposure science . The ‘Exposure Details’ data - tab ( red arrow ) on CTD’s chemical page for air pollutants lists 2591 results ( red circle ) for air pollution markers ( e . g . particulate matter , sulfates and carbon ) , including the type of medium in which the marker was assayed , the units of measurements , the statistics associated with the measurement ( blue box ) , as well as any disease / phenotype outcomes . This view aggregates the data from all germane articles for the chemical - of - interest . Column headers in the table will sort the information by clicking ( blue arrow ) and embedded terms are hyperlinked to their respective CTD pages ( green arrow and green inset box ) , allowing users to easily navigate to other concepts . At the bottom of every CTD page , a link allows users to download the information onto a desktop in a variety of formats . Additionally , we plan to enhance and develop new visual - ization and analytical tools to help users better explore our curated exposure science data . Two goals include allowing users to choose which data fields are displayed on a web page and enriching query pages to allow greater specifica - tion and filtering of returned data . We also plan to lever - age web - based maps to view exposure chemicals , events and outcomes from a geographical perspective . Currently in CTD , we have exposure data for 109 countries and all 50 US states . As well , we intend to release a new phenotype module , which will include our manual curation of chemicals regu - lating biological , cellular and physiological events in con - junction with anatomical descriptors . This feature will help associate and identify chemical - induced phenotypes that precede the clinical manifestation of a disease . We previ - ously released an initial deposit of this dataset using MeSH terms as our phenotype descriptions ( 26 ) ; however , since then , we have mapped those terms to the more versatile GO - BP controlled vocabulary to reflect greater granularity and broader coverage of biological concepts . Finally , we plan to devise computational programs that will systematically connect the spectrum of CTD cu - rated content by linking chemical - gene initiating events , chemical - phenotype and gene - GO key events , chemical - disease events and exposure - level outcomes for populations . Such computationally predicted adverse outcome pathways ( cpAOP ) have been recently described for fatty liver disease using rat data ( 36 ) . We hope to systematically expand upon this effort by leveraging CTD data to generate cpAOPs con - necting chemicals to disease outcomes . SUMMARY • We increased CTD content by 33 % to over 30 . 5 million toxicogenomic relationships . Nucleic Acids Research , 2017 , Vol . 45 , Database issue D977 Figure 4 . CTD’s new dataset generates novel inferences between GO terms and diseases . ( A ) Every GO term has its own page in CTD , and GO terms can be inferred to diseases based upon shared genes . Data integration via shared genes ( here , genes IL4 and TNF , green box ) allows the GO biological process ( GO - BP ) term ‘positive regulation of mononuclear cell migration’ ( orange oval ) to be inferred to the disease cardiomyopathies ( red circle ) . ( B ) An example of how users can leverage this information . Two diseases ( cardiomyopathies and contact dermatitis ) initially appear to be unrelated because they share no genes ; however , when instead viewed using inferred GO - BP terms , the two diseases overlap significantly with 583 inferred GO - BP terms ( P = 4 . 72 × 10 - 201 , Fisher’s exact test ) , suggesting potential molecular underpinnings common between the two pathologies . This discovery can have implications for recognizing co - morbidities ( especially for exposure science ) , identifying avenues to reposition therapeutic drugs or creating alerts to potentially new side effects . CTD’s files for ‘GO - Disease - Gene Inference Networks’ ( as well as all CTD curated content ) are freely available from our ‘Data Downloads’ page ( http : / / ctdbase . org / downloads / ) . • We introduced our exposure science module , containing 70 600 exposure statements for over 800 chemicals , 150 genes , 300 diseases and 180 phenotypes . • We described our GO - disease inference dataset , connect - ing functional , biological and cellular events between seemingly unrelated diseases . • We enhanced community database interoperability by providing links from our MEDIC disease vocabulary to DO terms .
