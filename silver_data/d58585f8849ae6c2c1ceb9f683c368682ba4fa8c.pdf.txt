We found that 57 . 5 % of infected referrals were male , 61 . 7 % of deaths by COVID - 19 occurred in subjects over 65 years of age , and only 2 . 4 % of deaths occurred in younger subjects ( < 30 years old ) . Analysis showed that mean PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 concentrations were cor - related to the incidence of COVID - 19 ( r = 0 . 547 , P < 0 . 05 , and r = 0 . 609 , P < 0 . 05 , respectively ) and positive chest CT scans ( r = 0 . 597 , P < 0 . 05 , and r = 0 . 541 , P < 0 . 05 respectively ) . We observed that a high daily air temperature ( 30 – 51 °C ) and a high relative humidity ( 60 – 97 % ) led to a significant reduction in the daily incidence of COVID - 19 . The highest number of positive chest CT scans were obtained in June 2020 and March 2021 for daily air temperature ranging from 38 °C and 49 °C and 11 °C and 15 °C , respectively . A negative correlation was detected between COVID - 19 cases and air temperature ( r = − 0 . 320 , P < 0 . 05 ) and relative humidity ( r = − 0 . 384 , P < 0 . 05 ) . In Ahvaz , a daily air temperature of 10 – 28 °C and relative humidity of 19 – 40 % are suitable for the spread of coronavirus . The highest correlation with the number of COVID - 19 cases was found at lag3 ( r = 0 . 42 ) and at lag0 with a positive chest CT scan ( r = 0 . 56 ) . For air temperature and relative humidity , the highest correlations were found at day 0 ( lag0 ) . During lockdown ( 22 March to 21 April 2020 ) , a reduction was observed for PM 10 ( 29 . 6 % ) , PM 2 . 5 ( 36 . 9 % ) and the Air Quality Index ( 33 . 3 % ) when compared to the previous month . During the pandemic period ( 2020 – 2021 ) , the annual mean concentrations of PM 10 ( 27 . 3 % ) and PM 2 . 5 ( 17 . 8 % ) were reduced compared to the 2015 – 2019 period .

Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Journal ( 2022 ) 4 : 182 – 195 1 3 than 118 , 000 COVID - 19 cases in 114 countries and 4291 deaths on 11 March 2020 and declared the beginning of a new global pandemic ( World Health Organization , 2020 ) . The number of new cases increased sharply worldwide with 3 , 942 , 907 infected people and 271 , 646 deaths reported in May 2020 in more than 200 countries [ 82 ] . In Iran , approxi - mately 9 , 000 COVID - 19 cases and 354 deaths were reported on 11 March 2020 ( https : / / behda sht . gov . ir ) . The first COVID - 19 case in Iran was reported in Qom county on 19 February 2020 and on 23 February 2020 in Ahvaz [ 32 , 68 ] . In Iran , the highest number of daily infected cases ( 14 , 051 ) and deaths ( 486 ) were reported on 27 and 16 November 2020 , respectively ( https : / / world omete rs . info ) . With the virus spreading , the Iranian government started programs for reducing fatalities ; one of these was lockdown . The first lockdown started on 22 March 2020 . Hence , a reduction of air pollution was observed due to limited anthropogenic activities [ 58 , 64 ] . COVID - 19 is well known as an acute respiratory disease leading to pneumonia with symptoms including fever , cough and dyspnea [ 39 ] with a fatality rate of approximately 2 – 3 % [ 38 , 65 ] . COVID - 19 primarily transmits from person to per - son in a closed environment due to reduced air ventilation [ 57 ] , the lack of ultraviolet light which can inactivate the virus and a reduced dilution indoors when compared to out - door air [ 17 ] . Male sex , advanced age , underlying disease and comorbidities may be associated with severe illness and a higher rate of mortality [ 7 ] . In addition , COVID - 19 appears to be correlated to the increasing rate of thrombo - embolic events in hospitalized patients [ 17 , 37 , 53 ] . Many factors contribute to disease emergence , includ - ing climate change , globalization and urbanization ; most of these factors are caused by humans [ 23 ] . Anthropogenic activities are a major issue of air pollution due to the emis - sion of harmful pollutants and sources of transmissible dis - ease agents [ 5 , 22 – 24 , 43 , 44 , 73 ] . Fine particles , with an aerodynamic diameter lower than 2 . 5 µm ( PM 2 . 5 ) or 10 µm ( PM 10 ) , are mainly emitted from sources such as vehicles , energy industries and dust [ 35 , 43 ] and have potentially the most significant effects on human health when compared to other air pollutants [ 25 ] . Particles , especially PM 2 . 5 , are known to be responsible for different lung diseases and res - piratory infections [ 45 , 50 , 56 ] . Previous studies showed that acute exposure to air pollutants increased the severity and the risk of hospital admissions for respiratory viral infec - tions [ 28 ] . A good correlation was observed between air pollution and SARS - CoV - 1 outbreak in China , furthermore , exposure to air pollution was shown to increase the trans - mission of viral infections [ 14 , 18 ] . The transmission rate of SARS - CoV - 2 could be affected by air pollution level , air temperature and relative humidity [ 27 ] . A study in Bangla - desh indicated that high air temperature and relative humid - ity significantly reduced the transmission of COVID - 19 , while a peak of COVID - 19 spread was observed at a mean temperature of 26 °C [ 36 ] . Some studies have reported a cor - relation between the spread of COVID - 19 , air pollution and some meteorological parameters [ 27 , 36 , 38 , 54 , 58 , 66 , 72 , 79 ] . For the first time , this study investigated the relation - ships and time lag effects between PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 concen - trations , daily hospital admissions for COVID - 19 , chest CT scans , air temperature and relative humidity in Ahvaz , Iran from March 2020 to March 2021 . 2 Materials and Methods 2 . 1 The Study Area Ahvaz ( 31° 19 ′ N 48° 40 ′ E ) , the capital city of Khuzestan province , is located in the southwest of Iran . This city covers an area of 185 km 2 and has approximately 1 . 2 million inhab - itants [ 6 , 33 , 40 ] . Ahvaz experiences a hot desert climate with a long summer and short winter . The annual mean tem - perature is approximately 24 . 9 °C and sand and dust storms are common [ 34 ] . Iranian cities are ranked as the most pol - luted by PM 10 in the world [ 59 , 72 ] and can be considered as a case study to investigate the effects of lockdown on PM levels . Figure 1 shows a map of Ahvaz and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) of the city over Middle Eastern dust storms during summer 2021 with a backward trajectory of particulate matters ( PM ) . Based on the annual PM 10 mean concentration , Ahvaz ( 372 µg m −3 as the annual average in 2009 ) is the most polluted city in the world [ 55 ] . The high levels of PM in the air can be explained by industries located inside and around the city such as steel , gas and petroleum companies , oil refineries , and storms originating from the desert areas of Arabian countries [ 34 ] . 2 . 2 COVID‑19 Data An Acute Respiratory Section ( ARS ) or Respiratory Emer - gency ( RE ) unit was created in the Emergency Service at the Ahvaz Petroleum Hospital , located at the north of Ahvaz , for new daily cases with COVID - 19 symptoms . Samples were taken by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) ; to evaluate chest symptoms , we used computed tomography scans ( CT scan ) . Daily samples were recorded by the official group in the ARS and then the results were reported by the laboratory to the statistical team at the Emergency Operations Center ( EOC ) . The results were recorded daily , including date , first name , surname , age , sex , PCR test result and chest CT scan , and if need be , fatality date . Patients who were referred for chest CT scans were screened for COVID - 19 symptoms , and symptomatic patients were supported by a surgical mask and placed in an isolation room . All hospital referral data were taken from the Research and Education Center of Petroleum 184 Dr . Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Journal ( 2022 ) 4 : 182 – 195 1 3 Hospital . More than 15 , 000 positive PCR and 10 , 400 posi - tive chest CT scans were analyzed during the study period . We retrieved all data from 21 March 2020 until 20 March 2021 . 2 . 3 Environmental Data Air quality monitoring data were provided by Ahvaz ' s Environmental Protection Agency ( A - EPA ) . Due to obsolete or incomplete observations for several air pol - lutants , we restricted our regional analysis to two major air pollutants : hourly PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 concentrations ( µg m −3 ) ( http : / / khzdoe . ir / rha ) . Additional meteorological parameters , including hourly air temperature and relative humidity in Ahvaz from 21 March 2020 to 20 March 2021 were provided by the Meteorological Organization for four monitoring stations located in Ahvaz . Only background monitoring stations with at least 75 % of validated hourly Fig . 1 The location of study area , a MODIS of Ahvaz over a Middle Eastern dust storms on summer 2021 and b backward trajectory of particu - late matters 185 Dr . Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Journal ( 2022 ) 4 : 182 – 195 1 3 data in a year were included to calculate valid daily aver - ages [ 42 ] . 2 . 4 Air Quality Related to PM 10 , PM 2 . 5 and Lockdown By using daily PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 concentrations , we inves - tigated PM 10 versus PM 2 . 5 and the ratio PM 2 . 5 / PM 10 . To consider the short - term effects of meteorological param - eters [ 72 ] , the PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 mean concentrations during the COVID - 19 pandemic ( 2020 – 2021 ) were compared to previous years ( 2015 – 2019 ) . We defined three time peri - ods : before ( 21 February to 21 March 2020 ) , during ( 22 March to 21 April 2020 ) and after lockdown ( 22 April to 21 May 2020 ) . In addition , the air quality index ( AQI ) was calculated . where , IN HI and IN LO represent the AQI value , B HI and B LO are breakpoint concentrations more than or less than C , and C is the concentration of each pollutant . This parameter can be divided into six categories including good , satisfactory , moderate , poor , very poor , and severe depending on whether the AQI respectively falls between 0 – 50 , 51 – 100 , 101 – 200 , 201 – 300 , 301 – 400 , and 401 – 500 . 2 . 5 Statistical Analyses Data were tested for normality with the Kolmogo - rov – Smirnov one - sample D test . The non - parametric Spear - man test was used to analyze correlations between variables and applied to daily data : PM 10 , PM 2 . 5 , temperature , relative humidity , COVID - 19 cases , and positive chest CT scans . Statistical significance was set at P < 0 . 05 and statistical analyses were performed with Excel . 3 Results 3 . 1 Hospital Admissions Information Of the 15 , 280 COVID - 19 cases admitted to the Petroleum Hospital from 21 March 2020 to 20 March 2021 ( Table 1 ) , 57 % of patients were male with an average age of 50 . 1 years ; the average age of women was slightly higher ( 50 . 5 years ) . Among those with a positive PCR result , 40 . 0 % of males and 46 . 8 % of females experienced underlying diseases . With regards to the number of deaths , 56 . 6 % were male ; the average age of deaths for both male and female was similar ( 66 . 5 years ) . AQI = IN HI − IN LO B HI − B LO × ( C − B LO ) + IN LO , The highest number of patients were with the age ranges of 35 – 39 and 55 – 59 years , 12 . 3 % and 11 . 3 % of the total number of hospital admissions , respectively . Children ( < 9 years ) represented 0 . 1 % of the total number of patients . Analysis showed that 61 . 7 % of deaths by COVID - 19 occurred in subjects over 65 years ; 2 . 4 % of people < 30 years of age died in Petroleum Hospital . The highest number of fatalities occurred in subjects who were 70 – 79 years of age . Furthermore , 35 . 9 % of patients died in the 30 – 64 years age range ( Table 2 ) . 3 . 2 Time‑Series Variations of PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 The highest daily PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 concentrations were observed on 18 March 2021 ( 396 . 4 µg m −3 ) and on 6 May 2020 ( 121 . 6 µg m −3 ) , respectively ( Fig . S1 ) . In Ahavz , the highest ( 160 . 84 and 67 . 68 µg m −3 ) and the lowest ( 51 . 27 and 25 . 79 µg m −3 ) monthly PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 mean concen - trations were also observed in October 2020 for PM 10 , and in January 2021 for PM 2 . 5 ( Fig . S2 ) . The annual mean con - centrations of PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 were 119 . 6 and 38 . 2 µg m −3 , respectively , showing that PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 concentrations exceeded the annual limit value established by the WHO Air Quality Guideline for the protection of human health ( 50 and 25 µg m −3 , respectively ) . A significant correlation between the daily mean concentrations of PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 was identified ( r = 0 . 75 , P < 0 . 01 ) , with an average PM 2 . 5 / PM 10 value of . 0 . 32 ( Fig . 2a , a ' Table 3 ) . 3 . 3 Correlation Analyses Between PM 10 , PM 2 . 5 , COVID‑19 Cases and Positive Chest CT Scans The temporal pattern of monthly PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 versus COVID - 19 cases and positive chest CT scans showed that with an increase of PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 concentrations , the rate of COVID - 19 cases and positive chest CT scans also increased , especially from October 2020 to March 2021 . The highest and lowest monthly average COVID - 19 ( 79 . 36 , 21 . 4 cases ) and positive chest CT scans ( 31 . 93 , 3 . 15 cases ) were in March 2021 and April 2020 for COVID - 19 with PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 respectively ( 124 . 45 and 93 . 15 µg m −3 ) and on June 2020 and January 2021 for positive chest CT scans with Table 1 Referral information to the Petroleum Hospital between March 2020 and March 2021 Male Female Percentage ( % ) 57 . 5 42 . 5 Average age ( years ) 50 . 1 50 . 5 People with underlying disease ( % ) 40 . 0 46 . 8 COVID - 19 fatality rate ( % ) 56 . 6 43 . 4 Average age of deaths ( years ) 66 . 5 66 . 5 186 Dr . Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Journal ( 2022 ) 4 : 182 – 195 1 3 PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 concentrations of 31 . 93 and 3 . 15 µg m −3 , respectively ( Fig . S3 ) . The PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 concentra - tions were correlated with the number of COVID - 19 cases : r = 0 . 47 ( P < 0 . 05 ) , and r = 0 . 41 ( P < 0 . 05 ) , respectively ( Fig . 3a – b ' , Table 3 ) . Furthermore , the PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 concentrations were both correlated with positive chest CT scans ( r = 0 . 59 , P < 0 . 05 , and r = 0 . 56 , P < 0 . 05 respectively ) . 3 . 4 Temporal Variations of Temperature and Relative Humidity The relationship between air temperature ( °C ) and rela - tive humidity ( % ) are shown in Fig . 4 . The highest daily temperature and relative humidity were 51 . 5 °C and 97 % , respectively , on 30 July 2020 and 2 December 2020 . The daily times series showed that an increasing temperature led to reduced relative humidity reaching a peak during summer for temperature and winter for relative humid - ity . Furthermore , the monthly variations showed that July 2020 with a mean air temperature of 47 . 8 °C and a rela - tive humidity of 27 % was the warmest during the time period of this study . The highest monthly average relative humidity 80 % was identified in December 2020 with a mean temperature of 20 . 3 °C ( Fig . S4 ) . Multivariate analy - sis showed that the mean temperature was significantly associated with relative humidity ( Table 3 ) . The interac - tion between air temperature was negatively correlated ( r = − 0 . 81 , P < 0 . 01 ) with relative humidity ( Fig . 4a , a ' , Table 3 ) .

Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Journal ( 2022 ) 4 : 182 – 195 1 3 3 . 5 Meteorological Parameters , COVID‑19 Incidence and Positive Chest CT Scans The highest number of declared COVID - 19 cases was observed when the daily air temperature and relative humid - ity ranged between 10 . 3 and 28 . 0 °C and between 19 and 40 % respectively in February – March 2021 . The lowest num - ber of COVID - 19 cases was registered when the relative humidity exceeded on average 60 % with a mean air tempera - ture of 20 – 30 °C in Ahvaz . The lowest average number of positive chest CT scans was observed for relative humidity ranged from 65 to 80 % with 3 . 1 – 4 . 3 cases on average . The highest positive chest CT scan was obtained in June 2020 and March 2021 for daily air temperature ranging from 38 to 49 °C and 11 to 15 °C , respectively .

Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Journal ( 2022 ) 4 : 182 – 195 1 3 respectively . Higher relative humidity ( > 60 % ) strongly reduced the number of positive chest CT scan ( see Fig . S5 ) . The results of correlation between air temperature and relative humidity with COVID - 19 cases and positive chest CT scan of patients admitted to the Petroleum Hospital dur - ing March 2020 to March 2021 are shown in Fig . 5a – b ' . A negative correlation was found between COVID - 19 inci - dence with air temperature ( r = − 0 . 33 , P < 0 . 05 ) and rela - tive humidity ( r = − 0 . 35 , P < 0 . 05 ) . There was no associa - tion between air temperature and positive chest CT scans ( r = 0 . 32 , P > 0 . 05 ) while the relative humidity and posi - tive chest CT scans were negatively correlated ( r = − 0 . 82 , P < 0 . 01 ) . 3 . 6 Time Lag Effect A higher correlation ( r = 0 . 60 ) was identified between daily PM 10 concentrations at day + 10 and the number of COVID - 19 cases at day 0 ( Table 4 ) , while the highest cor - relation with positive chest CT scans was observed on day 0 ( r = 0 . 59 ) . For daily PM 2 . 5 , the highest correlation with the number of COVID - 19 cases was found between lag3 ( r = 0 . 42 ) and lag0 with positive chest CT scans ( r = 0 . 56 ) . For air temperature and relative humidity , the highest cor - relations were found on day 0 ( lag0 ) . 3 . 7 Air Quality and the Effect of Lockdown The mean PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 concentrations and the AQI were calculated before , during and after lockdown from 21 February to 21 May 2020 ( Fig . 6 ) . Before the lock - down , the mean PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 concentrations and the AQI were 114 . 5 and 40 . 5 µg m −3 and 168 , respectively . The reduction during the lockdown period ( established from 22 March to 21 April 2020 ) was 29 . 6 % , 36 . 9 % and 33 . 3 % , respectively . From 22 April 2020 to 21 May 2020 , the AQI in Ahvaz increased by 66 . 1 % ; this was similar to the PM 10 ( + 63 . 6 % ) and PM 2 . 5 ( + 61 . 3 % ) concentrations . A comparison of PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 mean concentrations between the pre - COVID - 19 pandemic from 2015 to 2019 was carried out between 2020 and 2021 ( Table 5 ) . During the COVID - 19 period , the annual PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 mean concentrations were reduced by 27 . 3 % and 17 . 8 % , respec - tively , when compared to the 5 - years time period .

Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Journal ( 2022 ) 4 : 182 – 195 1 3 4 Discussion In the Middle Eastern regions , the annual PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 mean concentrations typically ranged from 72 to 303 and 11 to 35 µg m −3 , respectively [ 34 ] . Over the 2015 – 2019 period , the annual PM 10 mean concentrations ranged from 155 . 8 to 178 . 3 µg m −3 while the PM 2 . 5 mean concentra - tions ranged from 43 . 5 to 50 . 7 µg m −3 . In 2020 – 2021 , during the COVID - 19 pandemic , the annual PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 mean concentrations were 119 . 6 and 38 . 2 µg m −3 , respectively . The poor and continuous deterioration in air quality in Ahvaz is due to the presence of several indus - tries inside and around the city and dust storms from Ara - bian countries [ 4 , 20 , 41 , 73 ] . The PM 2 . 5 / PM 10 ratio in the Middle East is due to the high levels of PM during dust storms and ranges from 0 . 21 to 0 . 59 [ 42 ] . Our analysis revealed a PM 2 . 5 / PM 10 of 0 . 32 in Ahvaz from March 2020 Table 4 Correlation coefficient ( Spearman’s test ) between daily PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 mean concentrations , air temperature , and relative humidity with positive chest CT scan and COVID - 19 cases at different time lags ( 0 – 13 days ) The strongest correlations are shown in bold ( ns not significant , P > 0 . 1 ) PM 10 vs COVID PM 10 vs CT scan PM 2 . 5 vs COVID PM 2 . 5 vs CT scan T vs COVID T vs CT scan RH vs COVID RH vs CT scan lag0 0 . 47 0 . 59 0 . 41 0 . 56 − 0 . 33 0 . 32 − 0 . 35 − 0 . 82 lag1 0 . 35 0 . 55 0 . 30 0 . 52 − 0 . 24 0 . 30 − 0 . 23 − 0 . 63 lag2 0 . 50 ns 0 . 40 ns − 0 . 26 0 . 28 − 0 . 22 − 0 . 63 lag3 0 . 55 ns 0 . 42 ns − 0 . 24 0 . 28 − 0 . 20 − 0 . 62 lag4 0 . 43 ns 0 . 40 ns − 0 . 22 0 . 29 − 0 . 22 − 0 . 63 lag5 0 . 47 ns 0 . 24 ns − 0 . 22 0 . 28 − 0 . 21 − 0 . 61 lag6 ns ns ns ns − 0 . 21 0 . 27 − 0 . 23 − 0 . 61 lag7 ns ns ns ns − 0 . 23 0 . 27 − 0 . 27 − 0 . 60 lag8 ns ns ns ns − 0 . 22 0 . 28 − 0 . 21 − 0 . 58 lag9 ns ns ns ns − 0 . 23 0 . 27 − 0 . 21 − 0 . 60 lag10 0 . 60 ns ns ns − 0 . 22 0 . 28 ns − 0 . 60 lag11 0 . 47 ns ns ns ns 0 . 28 ns − 0 . 59 lag12 0 . 55 ns ns ns ns 0 . 26 − 0 . 20 − 0 . 58 lag13 ns ns ns ns ns 0 . 26 − 0 . 22 − 0 . 55 002 051 001 05 0 05 - PM10 ( µg / m3 ) PM2 . 5 ( µg / m3 ) AQI Change rate Variation ( during - after ) % Variation ( before - during ) % After - lockdown During - lockdown Before - lockdown Fig . 6 Mean PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 concentrations and air quality index ( AQI ) before ( 21 February to 21 March 2020 ) , during ( 22 March to 21 April 2020 ) and after lockdown ( 22 April to 21 May 2020 ) in Ahvaz , Iran 190 Dr . Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Journal ( 2022 ) 4 : 182 – 195 1 3 to March 2021 . Depending on the fraction of coarse dust in the air , this ratio may undergo change [ 29 , 42 ] . This low value is typical of regions dominated by geological dust in contrast to rural areas where combustion processes involving coal or wood burning show predominance [ 30 ] . Approximately 61 . 7 % of deaths by COVID - 19 occurred in subjects over 65 years of age in Petroleum Hospi - tal and only 2 . 4 % of deaths occurred in younger subjects ( those < 30 years of age ) . Reference [ 61 ] showed that 80 % of deaths by COVID - 19 occurred in adults over 65 years of age in the United States and concluded that most deaths occurred in the 60 – 69 - year age group in five European coun - tries ( Italy , Spain , France , Germany and the Netherlands ) . In Italy , the fatality rates ranged from less than 3 % in sub - jects < 60 years of age to more than 30 % in people > 80 years of age [ 74 ] . The large differences in fatality rates by age are associated to higher rates of chronic comorbidities in elder populations [ 74 , 75 ] . Our study confirms previous results [ 17 ] which reported that males were more at risk of COVID - 19 . Preliminary studies were performed to assess the effects of air pollution ( e . g . , PM 10 , PM 2 . 5 ) and meteoro - logical parameters ( e . g . , air temperature , relative humidity ) on the spread of COVID - 19 [ 48 , 82 ] . We are still far from fully understanding COVID - 19 epidemiology , so conduct - ing different studies could help enhance our understanding of this disease . Epidemiological studies have confirmed the association of PM with respiratory diseases and found that fine PM could potentiate viral transmissions [ 48 , 73 , 78 ] . Further - more , viral replication in the respiratory system is enhanced by the negative effects of PM on the integrity of the human respiratory barrier [ 48 ] . The influenza and respiratory syncy - tial viruses remain in the air for a long period after becoming attached to PM , this allows viruses to be transmitted by the airborne route [ 51 ] . In this study , both the PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 concentrations were positively correlated with the incidence of COVID - 19 ( chest CT scans and PCR tests ) . The inci - dence of COVID - 19 increased with rising PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 concentrations [ 82 ] and a high frequency of PM 10 concentra - tion peaks ( exceeding 50 μg m −3 ) resulted in an accelerated spread of COVID - 19 , thus suggesting a “boost effect” with regards to viral infectivity [ 71 ] . The increase in outdoor air PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 concentrations was positively associated with an increased risk of COVID - 19 transmission [ 9 ] . Ref - erence [ 48 ] reported a significant correlation between PM 10 ( r 2 = 0 . 15 ) , PM 2 . 5 ( r 2 = 0 . 23 ) and the incidence of COVID - 19 between the 26th of January and the 29th of February 2020 in Wuhan and XiaoGan ( China ) . A 1 µg m −3 increase in long - term PM 2 . 5 exposure is related to a 15 % increase in the risk of death by COVID - 19 [ 79 ] . Reference [ 81 ] reported a positive association between the incidence of COVID - 19 and both PM 2 . 5 ( r = 0 . 48 ) and PM 10 ( r = 0 . 49 ) concentrations in Wuhan ( China ) . Following an increase of 10 µg m −3 in PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 , the mortality rate of COVID - 19 increased by 0 . 83 % and 0 . 86 % , respec - tively [ 81 ] . Similarly , in Europe , positive relationships were found between PM 10 , PM 2 . 5 , and the fatality rate of COVID - 19 [ 26 ] . Other studies have reported that short - term PM 2 . 5 exposure is positively correlated to the risk of respiratory infection by COVID - 19 among people in Canada and New York [ 3 , 76 ] . In the present study , higher correlations were found between PM 10 , PM 2 . 5 and chest CT scans compared to PCR tests . In China , only 3 % of admitted patients had nega - tive PCR tests while having positive chest CT scans [ 80 ] . However , PCR tests are easy to perform and provide fast results , thus enabling the rapid diagnosis of COVID - 19 [ 1 ] . The mean temperature and air quality were previously shown to be significantly associated with the COVID - 19 pandemic in New - York [ 10 ] . Air temperature and relative humidity are the most important meteorological parameters affecting COVID - 19 mortality and the air temperature is known to be correlated to the spread of COVID - 19 [ 16 , 54 , 63 ] . In this study , we also found that high daily air tempera - ture ( 30 – 51 °C ) and high relative humidity ( 60 – 97 % ) led to a significant reduction in the daily incidence of COVID - 19 . High air temperature and relative humidity appear to have an inhibitory effect on COVID - 19 transmission . The virus was transmitted more efficiently in Ahvaz at a daily air tem - perature of 10 – 28 °C with a relative humidity of 19 – 40 % . In Milan ( Italy ) , [ 82 ] showed there was a negative asso - ciation between daily air temperature and relative humidity with the number of new cases of COVID - 19 . In Wuhan , the daily temperature ( r 2 = 0 . 14 ) was inversely correlated to the incidence of COVID - 19 [ 48 ] . Reference [ 8 ] reported that cities with a mean air temperature lower than 24 °C were all at high - risk of COVID - 19 transmission while [ 13 ] showed that the most suitable air temperature for the spread of coro - navirus was 13 – 24 °C with a relative humidity of 50 % . Our findings are in line with this previous research . Lockdown due to the COVID - 19 pandemic reduced industrial activities , transport and energy consumption [ 38 ] .

Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Journal ( 2022 ) 4 : 182 – 195 1 3 In Iran , 21 March to 21 April 2020 was selected as a period of lockdown by the government to reduce the incidence of COVID - 19 . During the lockdown , there was a significant reduction in PM 10 ( 29 . 6 % ) , PM 2 . 5 ( 36 . 9 % ) , and AQI ( 33 . 3 % ) in Ahvaz when compared to the month before ( 21 Febru - ary to 21 March 2020 ) . During the COVID - 19 pandemic , the annual mean concentrations of PM 10 ( 27 . 3 % ) and PM 2 . 5 ( 17 . 8 % ) were reduced when compared to the previous 5 - year period ( 2015 – 2019 ) [ 38 ] also showed that PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 concentrations and AQI decreased by 15 % , 8 % and 13 % , respectively , during the lockdown in Baghdad . Reference [ 11 ] reported that in Malaysia , PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 concentra - tions decreased during lockdown by 26 – 31 % and 23 – 32 % , respectively . This significant reduction of PM levels was widely observed in Europe , the United States and in Asia before and during the lockdown ( e . g . , Andrée , 2020 ; Masum and Pal , 2020 ) [ 72 ] . By considering temporal data , trends analysis in Marseille ( southern France ) showed that the restrictive measures due to COVID - 19 led to 11 % reduction in PM 2 . 5 concentrations when compared to data for 2010 to 2019 [ 42 ] . A comparison between different studies and the variations in PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 concentrations during COVID - 19 lockdown is presented in Table 6 . In this study , PM 2 . 5 and PM 10 concentrations were aver - aged from air quality monitoring stations . We also assumed that all individuals shared the same particle levels in and around Ahvaz ; therefore the individual exposure estimate was erroneous [ 72 ] . In addition , only the outdoor exposure to PM was considered while people spent almost 100 % of their time in indoor environments during lockdown ; PM con - centrations are generally lower indoors than outdoors [ 47 ] . A high concentration on a given day can produce effects over the following days , i . e . , a lag effect , and accumula - tive exposure can produce larger delayed effects [ 67 ] . The estimated effects are erroneous by omitting the lag effect of PM exposure , i . e . , by assuming that all effects occur on one day [ 69 ] . Lag models with la ag of several days / weeks have offered a better measure of the effects of air pollution on human health when compared to the single day model [ 2 , 52 ] . Higher correlations were found between daily PM 2 . 5 and PM 10 concentrations and the number of COVID - 19 cases at 3 - and 10 - days lag , while positive chest CT scans were better correlated to PM 2 . 5 and PM 10 with no lag . In Ahvaz , significant relationships were reported between an increase in PM 10 levels and cardiovascular deaths between 3 - and 13 - days lag [ 21 ] . 5 Conclusion In Ahvaz , males over 65 years of age were at high risk of COVID - 19 . In this study , several parameters were analyzed to provide additional evidence relating to the relationship between particle pollution ( PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 ) , meteorologi - cal parameters ( air temperature and relative humidity ) and COVID - 19 incidence between May 2020 and May 2021 in Ahvaz ( Iran ) . Significant correlations between daily PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 concentrations were identified . We found a posi - tive relationship between PM 10 and PM 2 . 5 with COVID - 19 incidence and positive chest CT scans , thus yielding further evidence that air pollution provides a favorable context for the spread of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus [ 19 , 82 ] . The interac - tion between daily air temperature was negatively correlated with relative humidity . In Ahvaz , an air temperature between 10 and 28 °C and a relative humidity between 19 and 40 % were found to be most suitable for the spread of coronavirus . However , a high daily air temperature ( > 30 °C ) and rela - tive humidity ( > 60 % ) significantly reduced the incidence of COVID - 19 . Air quality was notably improved during the COVID - 19 lockdown ; this led to a large reduction in PM 10 , PM 2 . 5 and AQI when compared to mean concentrations over the previous 5 years ( 2015 – 2019 ) .
