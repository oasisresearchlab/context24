The communication between these cells is critical in maintaining liver function homeostasis , and dysregulation of such communication contributes to the pathogenesis of various liver diseases . Extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) , including exosomes and ectosomes , act as important mediators of cell - to - cell communication . EVs can be produced and uptaken by a wide range of cells including all types of cells in the liver . Growing evidences show that EVs are involved in the development of liver diseases , especially non - alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) and alcoholic liver disease ( ALD ) . In this review , we will summarize recent advance in how EVs production are altered in NAFLD and ALD and how the changes of EVs quantity and cargos influence the progression of these diseases . The therapeutic and diagnostic potential of EVs in NAFLD and ALD will be also discussed in this review . Keywords : extracellular vesicles , non - alcoholic fatty liver disease , alcoholic liver disease , pathogenesis , biomarker INTRODUCTION The term extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) refers to a highly heterogeneous population of cell - derived membrane - enclosed structures ( van Niel et al . , 2018 ) . EVs can be generally divided into two classes , ectosomes and exosomes ( Gurunathan et al . , 2021 ) . They are presenting in all biological fluids such as blood , milk , saliva , intercellular fluid and play pleiotropic roles in cell - to - cell communications ( Ratajczak and Ratajczak , 2020 ) . EVs carry various cargoes of proteins , lipids , and genetic materials that can deliver signals to induce physiological or pathological changes in recipient cells ( Cocozza et al . , 2020 ) . In the field of liver diseases , the number of publications about EVs has grown exponentially over past decade . EVs are emerging as key players in the pathogenesis and progression of metabolic liver diseases including non - alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) and alcoholic liver disease ( ALD ; Eguchi and Feldstein , 2018 ) . NAFLD and ALD are serious health issues around the world . They can progress to hepatocyte injury , steatohepatitis , or cirrhosis , an entity designated as alcoholic steatohepatitis ( ASH ) and non - alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ; Mitra et al . , 2020 ) . In these diseases , a large number of EVs are released by stressed / damaged hepatocytes and published : 14 July 2021 4 Wu et al . EV in NAFLD and ALD Frontiers in Physiology | www . frontiersin . org 2 July 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 707429 act on the target cells to promote inflammation , angiogenesis , and fibrosis ( Hernandez et al . , 2020 ) . Additionally , as an effective way to deliver protein or nuclear acid to target cells , EVs have been considered as a potential tool for the therapy of liver diseases including NAFLD and ALD . They also have been suggested as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for liver diseases ( Szabo and Momen - Heravi , 2017 ; Urban et al . , 2019 ; Wiklander et al . , 2019 ; Thietart and Rautou , 2020 ) . Here , we focus on the current state of knowledge pertaining to EVs , including how EVs production is regulated in NAFLD and ALD and how EVs mediated intercellular communications contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of NAFLD / ALD . We will also discuss possible therapeutic and diagnostic applications of EVs in NAFLD and ALD . THE BIOGENESIS , CARGOS , AND BIOLOGIC FUNCTION OF EVS The Biogenesis of EVs Extracellular vesicles are membrane - enclosed nanostructures , they can be secreted by specific tissues and cells in vitro and in vivo . For example , all types of cells in the liver have been proved to generate EVs under in vitro conditions ( Xie et al . , 2019 ) . Based on their biogenesis mechanisms , two major categories of EVs have been described : Ectosomes and Exosomes ( Figure 1 ) . Exosomes are approximately 30 – 200 nm in diameter ( Pegtel and Gould , 2019 ) . They arise from endosomal multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) , which fuse with the plasma membrane and then release into extracellular space and circulation ( Doyle and Wang , 2019 ) . During this process , early endosomes are formed by the inward budding of the plasma membrane , or in some cases from the trans - Golgi network ( Teng and Fussenegger , 2020 ) . Early endosomes fuse to form late endosomes and finally generate MVBs . Exosomes are essentially intraluminal vesicles ( ILVs ) of MVBs . Multiple molecular mechanisms of ILVs generation in MVBs have been revealed . Furthermore , accumulating evidences supports that the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport ( ESCRTs ) play a critical role in the biogenesis of MVBs and cargo sorting ( Sun et al . , 2018 ) . ESCRTs consist of four complexes of protein components , including ESCRT - 0 , ESCRT - I , ESCRT - II , and ESCRT - III ( Mashouri et al . , 2019 ) . The ESCRT - 0 components recognizes and sequesters ubiquitylated cargos in the endosomal membrane ( Juan and Furthauer , 2018 ) , ESCRT - I / II complexes appear to be responsible for membrane deformation into buds with sequestered cargo ( Frankel and Audhya , 2018 ) , and then ESCRT - III subcomplexes drive the fission of vesicle ( Larios et al . , 2020 ) . In addition to the ESCRTs mechanism , the biogenesis of MVBs depends on other mechanisms . For instance , neutral sphingomyelinase 2 ( nSMase2 ) can regulate the production of bioactive lipid ceramide , thereby triggering the maturation of MVBs ( Kosaka et al . , 2010 ; Shamseddine et al . , 2015 ) . Eventually , exosomes are formed in the extracellular space by fusing MVBs with the plasma membrane and releasing the contained ILVs . The small GTPase Ral such as Rab27 a / b , Rab35 , and RalA has been widely accepted to participate FIGURE 1 | The biogenesis of extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) . Exosomes and ectosomes are two types of EVs secreted by cells . Exosomes ( ~ 30 – 200 nm in diameter ) originate from the endosomal pathway and are secreted by the fusion of multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) with the plasma membrane . Ectosomes ( size range ~ 50 – 500 nm ) are generated by the direct outward budding of the plasma membrane . The budding of EVs involves a variety of mechanisms , and is a combination of one or more of the following mechanisms : endosomal sorting complexes required for transport ( ESCRT ) complex , neutral sphingomyelinase 2 ( nSMase2 ) generating ceramide , GTPase Ral , and the Rho family . However , specific biogenesis mechanisms are not yet clearly known . EVs are highly heterogeneous population . The cargos of EVs contain different types of cell surface proteins , intracellular protein , genetic materials [ such as DNAs , messenger RNAs ( mRNAs ) , and miRNAs ] , and lipid . Wu et al . EV in NAFLD and ALD Frontiers in Physiology | www . frontiersin . org 3 July 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 707429 in the progression ( Maas et al . , 2017 ) . Specifically , some proteins also are involved in the biogenesis of exosomes , and they can be used as markers for exosomes such as CD9 , CD81 , CD63 , flotillin , TSG101 , ceramide , and Alix ( Kalluri and LeBleu , 2020 ) . By contrast , ectosomes with a size range of ~ 50 – 500 nm in diameter that generated by the direct outward budding of the plasma membrane ( Gurunathan et al . , 2021 ) . They are also known as microparticles or microvesicles . Less is known about the molecular mechanisms of ectosome biogenesis compared with that of exosomes . Recent evidence demonstrates that two ESCRT subcomplexes may be involved in the outward - budding of ectosomes . The ESCRT - I component TSG101 is recruited to the cell surface by arresting domain - containing protein 1 ( ARRDC1 ) , directly causes the evagination of plasma membrane and the release of ectosomes ( Nabhan et al . , 2012 ) . The negative curvature - promoting ESCRT - III proteins could mediate plasma membrane deformation and release of ectosomes ( Chiaruttini et al . , 2015 ) . Additional mechanisms that regulate the biogenesis of ectosomes include the small GTPase Arf6 and the Rho family ( RhoA , Cdc42 , and Rac1 ) , which induce actin / cytoskeletal rearrangements to promote the shed of ectosomes ( Latifkar et al . , 2019 ) . External factors can involve in the biogenesis of ectosomes . For example , the influx of calcium induces the redistribution of the phospholipids , thereby promoting the release of ectosomes ( Abels and Breakefield , 2016 ) . The Cargos of EVs As a class of highly heterogeneous bilayered structures , EVs carry a rich cargo of various bioactive substances . Firstly , EVs are enriched with a complex of various proteins including cytoskeletal proteins , cytosolic proteins , extracellular matrix proteins , secreted proteins , and plasma membrane proteins such as adhesion proteins , receptors , tetraspanins , transporters , and vesicle trafficking - related proteins ( Akbar et al . , 2019 ) . Similar to a cell , the lipid membrane of EVs is enriched with cholesterol , ceramide , phosphatidylserine , and sphingolipids ( Kreimer et al . , 2015 ) . In addition , EVs contain vesicle - specific genetic materials , such as non - coding RNAs ( e . g . , miRNA , long non - coding RNA , mitochondrial associated tRNA , and small nucleolar RNA ) , messenger RNAs ( mRNAs ) , and DNAs ( e . g . , mitochondrial DNA , and even genomic DNA ; Stahl and Raposo , 2019 ) . Notably , the composition of EVs can reflect the characteristics of the parental cells . Therefore , analysis of EVs composition showed that some components were specific from cell and tissue of origin , and some are common in all EVs ( Kowal et al . , 2016 ) . The composition of EVs determines their complexity and potential functional diversity . As EVs carry abundant cargos , many studies have identified the proteomic , transcriptomic , and lipidomic profiles of EVs by high - throughput analysis ( Gandham et al . , 2020 ) . At the present time , EVs - specific cargos can be accessible on public databases such as ExoCarta , Vesiclepedia , EV - TRACK , and EVpedia ( Keerthikumar et al . , 2017 ; Roux et al . , 2020 ) . These resources provide insightful information for studying molecular mechanism of EVs’ pathophysiological role underlying different disease conditions . The Biologic Function of EVs Growing evidences indicate that EVs have many cell - intrinsic biologic functions . EVs play important roles in cell - cell communication and exist in various tissues and biological fluids ( Sung et al . , 2018 ) . EVs can complete intercellular communication in a paracrine or autocrine manner , involving a variety of physiological and pathological responses , such as inflammatory response , invasion and metastasis of tumor cells , angiogenesis , immune response , and drug resistance , etc ( Shen et al . , 2017 ) . Due to the characteristics of biocompatibility and stability , EVs can be ideal vehicles for the delivery of drugs , miRNAs , proteins , and other molecules ( Villata et al . , 2020 ) . Experimental evidence has shown the potential use of EVs in delivering targeted RNA - based therapies in the context of liver diseases ( O’Brien et al . , 2020 ) . In addition , different EVs contents at different stages can be used as biomarkers and non - invasive diagnostic tools . For instance , circulating miR - 135a - 3p in serum EVs serve as potential biomarkers of NAFLD ( Jiang et al . , 2021 ) . In a word , EVs is promising in clinical applications both as biomarkers and as therapeutic delivery vehicles , but further studies are required to completely resolve the functional capabilities of EVs . EVS IN THE LIVER AND UPON ALCOHOL AND LIPOTOXIC STIMULATION Liver is the largest metabolic organ of the human body . The organ is composed of several different types of parenchymal and non - parenchymal cells , which include hepatocytes , biliary epithelial cells ( cholangiocytes ) , Kupffer cells , liver sinusoidal endothelial cells ( LSECs ) , hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) , and other immune cells ( Trefts et al . , 2017 ) . In both physiological and pathological conditions , all types of cells in the liver have been proved to release EVs as well as being targets of endogenous EVs . Compared with the normal physiological condition , the concentration of EVs and the composition of EVs cargos undergo significant changes when the liver was under stress / damage or pathological state ( Xie et al . , 2019 ) . Healthy human volunteers with binge alcohol drinking or mice after binge or chronic alcohol consumption showed significantly increased number of exosomes in serum . These exosomes were rich in miRNA - 122 , which is one of the most abundant miRNA in hepatocytes . Alcohol treatment activated the exosome biogenesis pathways by increasing mRNA expression levels of Rab27b , which was critical in controlling late endosomal formation ( Momen - Heravi et al . , 2015a ) . A very recent study showed that chronic - plus - binge ethanol induced the production of mtDNA - enriched EVs activation of the ASK1 - p38 pathway , which elevated the expression of NSMase2 , ALIX , Rab27A protein , and genes related to ESCRT ( Hgs , Pdcd61p , Stam1 , and Ykt6 ; Ma et al . , 2020 ) . In addition , alcohol also stimulated hepatocytes to release abundant EVs in a caspase - 3 activation dependent manner ( Verma et al . , 2016 ) . Moreover , another study showed that the alcohol - induced increase in EVs generation Wu et al . EV in NAFLD and ALD Frontiers in Physiology | www . frontiersin . org 4 July 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 707429 was associated with disruption of autophagy and impaired autophagosome and lysosome function . This study reveals that alcohol disrupts autophagy function through reduced lysosomal proteins ( LAMP1 and LAMP2 ) in livers with ALD , subsequently leading to a significant increase in EVs release both in macrophages and hepatocytes ( Babuta et al . , 2019 ) . Alcohol - and - HIV - induced lysosomal dysfunction showed similar effects in vitro and in liver - humanized mice ( Dagur et al . , 2021 ) . These studies clearly illustrated the link between effects of alcohol on EVs biogenesis . Similar with alcohol exposure , excessive lipid accumulation in hepatocytes was also related with large amounts of EVs release . Lipids can promote EVs release by activating death receptor 5 signaling and ROCK1 ( Hirsova et al . , 2016 ) . Endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress was also considered as a key regulator of EVs release in hepatocytes in response to free fatty acid treatment , evidenced by inositol requiring enzyme 1 α ( IRE1 α ) deficiency diminished the increased EVs release stimulated by free fatty acid ( Kakazu et al . , 2016 ) . A new study using in vivo NASH model further confirmed the critical role of ER stress in controlling EVs release from liver . High fat , fructose , and cholesterol diet activated IRE1 α signaling and EVs generation , while mice with liver specific knockout of IRE1 α blocked the elevation of EVs in this model ( Dasgupta et al . , 2020 ) . In addition to stress , mixed lineage kinase 3 was considered as a key regulator of EVs release in hepatocytes in response to lipotoxicity ( Ibrahim et al . , 2016 ) . As mentioned above , the composition of EVs changes significantly under stress / injury or pathological conditions . Alcohol and / or its metabolites can increase the amounts of EVs cargos . For instance , the amount of CYP2E1 , other P450 isoforms and some hepatic proteins were elevated in EVs released from alcohol exposed liver ( Cho et al . , 2017b ) . Similarly , hepatocyte abundant miR - 122 and miR - 192 were enriched in EVs isolated from serum of mice with fatty liver ( Povero et al . , 2014 ) . EVS IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF ALD AND NAFLD EVs in the Development of ALD Alcohol and its metabolites can induce a wide spectrum of hepatic lesions , the most common characteristic of which are fatty liver , hepatic inflammation , and fibrosis / cirrhosis ( Dunn and Shah , 2016 ) . Previous studies have identified several mechanisms in the progression of ALD , such as acetaldehyde and oxidative stress related to ethanol metabolism , epigenetic changes , ethanol - mediated induction of endotoxins from the impairment of intestinal permeability and subsequent activation of Kupffer cells ( Seitz et al . , 2018 ) . In addition , second hits include the complex of pharmacological , genetic , and viral factors , which can promote the progression of ALD . Currently , the contribution of EVs in the pathogenesis and progression of ALD is under evaluation . Research evidence suggests that the levels of CYP2E1 and other P450 isoforms are elevated in circulating EVs from alcohol - exposed mice and patients with alcoholism . EVs containing CYP2E1 and other P450 isoforms can further promote hepatocyte death by activating apoptosis signaling pathways ( Cho et al . , 2017b ) . Recent data indicate that long - term excessive intake of ethanol can promote the release of EVs rich in pro - inflammatory mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) by hepatocytes . These mtDNA enriched EVs were response for neutrophil recruitment and activation in the liver , which further damage the liver ( Cai et al . , 2017 ; Ma et al . , 2020 ) . Hepatocytes derived EVs can also impact other cells in the liver , especially liver macrophages . EVs isolated from serum of patients with alcohol binge drinking or in vitro ethanol - treated hepatocytes were taken up by recipient monocytes \ macrophages , and the mature form of liver - specific miRNA - 122 was transferred horizontally . EVs - mediated high levels of miRNA - 122 can increase the sensitivity of monocytes to LPS , thereby inducing more pro - inflammatory cytokines ( Momen - Heravi et al . , 2015a ) . In addition , hepatocyte - derived EVs activated macrophages into an M1 inflammatory phenotype . The CD40L contained in hepatocyte - derived EVs contributed to the activation of pro - inflammatory macrophage associated with alcohol - induced liver damage ( Verma et al . , 2016 ) . Another report showed that the number of circulating EVs was increased in ALD mice . The ALD associated EVs can be uptake by both hepatocytes and macrophages , which enhanced monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 expression and increased the number of M1 Kupffer cells / infiltrated monocytes . The effects of ALD EVs on liver macrophages was mediated by abundant Heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) in ALD EVs ( Saha et al . , 2018 ) . Notably , hepatocyte - derived EVs release were increased in AH and these EVs promote HSCs activation by specific miRNAs ( e . g . , miR - 27a and miR - 181a ) , which can target and repress the quiescent HSCs marker . In addition , AH - hepatocyte - derived EVs were enriched with DAMPs ( e . g . , mtDNA ) , which subsequently activated hepatic macrophages through toll - like receptor 9 ( TLR - 9 ) signaling ( Eguchi et al . , 2020 ) . Besides hepatocytes , monocyte / macrophage can also secrete more EVs after alcohol exposures . It was shown that alcohol dose - dependently increased EVs production in monocytes . EVs derived from alcohol treated monocytes promoted the M2 differentiation of naïve recipient monocytes . miR - 27a was identified as the major contributor of the effects of EVs derived from alcohol treated monocytes ( Saha et al . , 2016 ) . Extracellular vesicles also played an important role in the process of second hits aggravating ALD . For instance , the human plasma - derived exosomes contain substantial levels of metabolically active CYP2E1 , which play a key role in exacerbating alcohol and acetaminophen - ( APAP ) induced toxicity in hepatocytes ( Rahman et al . , 2019 ) . Another study showed that some cytokines and chemokines , such as IL - 8 , IL - 10 , and IL - 1ra were found specifically packaged in EVs from HIV - infected alcohol drinkers , which implied a novel mechanism for the involvement of EVs in the development of ALD ( Kodidela et al . , 2018 ) . All these studies have established solid evidences for the key role of EVs in the development of ALD . We have summarized these mechanisms in Figure 2 . Wu et al . EV in NAFLD and ALD Frontiers in Physiology | www . frontiersin . org 5 July 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 707429 EVs in the Development of NAFLD Certain toxic lipids such as saturated free fatty acids , free cholesterol , or ceramides and other sphingolipids accumulate in hepatocytes during the progression of NAFLD , leading to hepatocyte stress / injury through lipotoxicity . EVs are produced in large quantities during lipotoxicity and are involved in key processes in the pathogenesis of NAFLD , including angiogenesis , fibrosis , and inflammation . Hepatocytes are the main cell type of the liver , accounting for 80 % of the liver volume . Studies on mouse models and human subjects with NASH showed that hepatocytes are the main contributors to the elevated levels of circulating EVs ( Srinivas et al . , 2020 ) . Therefore , hepatocyte - derived EVs may play a key role in the pathogenesis and progression of NAFLD . For example , lipotoxic hepatocyte - derived EVs can promote liver inflammation through the interaction with macrophages , which express and release of several proinflammatory cytokines , such as IL - 1 β and IL - 6 . These EVs have been shown to contain TRAIL , which induce macrophage activation by activating NF - κ B pathway ( Hirsova et al . , 2016 ) . Palmitate as a precursor for some toxic lipid moieties , such as lysophosphatidyl choline , can induce the release of C16 : 0 ceramide - enriched EVs . The ceramide metabolites contain sphingosine - 1 - phosphate ( S1P ) , which promoted macrophage recruitment to the liver via S1P1 receptor mediated macrophage chemotaxis and enhanced liver inflammation ( Kakazu et al . , 2016 ) . In Steatohepatitis , activated IRE1A - induced the massive release of EVs , thereby recruiting macrophages into the liver and promoting liver inflammation by transmitting hepatocellular ER stress to macrophages ( Dasgupta et al . , 2020 ) . Additionally , lipotoxic hepatocyte - derived EVs were enriched with the ( C - X - C motif ) ligand 10 ( CXCL10 ) , which was a potent chemokine for macrophage chemotaxis . EVs - associated CXCL10 was more effective than free chemokines in stimulating macrophage chemotaxis ( Ibrahim et al . , 2016 ) . Another study showed that increased circulating EVs in NASH were enriched with mtDNA , which subsequently activated macrophage by TLR - 9 inflammatory signal ( Garcia - Martinez et al . , 2016 ) . The progression of NAFLD is significantly associated with the increase of visceral adiposity . EVs from visceral adipose tissue can target hepatocyte and HSC lines in vitro . These EVs increased matrix metalloproteinase - 1 ( TIMP - 1 ) and integrin ανβ - 5 expression and decreased matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) - 7 and plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1 expression in hepatocytes , while increased expression of TIMP - 1 , TIMP - 4 , Smad - 3 , integrin ανβ - 5 , integrin ανβ - 8 , and MMP - 9 in HSCs . These changes caused dysregulation of TGF β signaling pathway and may contribute to liver fibrosis in NASH ( Koeck et al . , 2014 ) . Lipotoxic hepatocyte derived EVs can be efficiently uptaken by HSCs . These EVs are rich in miR - 128 - 3p , which inhibits peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - γ ( PPAR - γ ) and consequent phenotypical switch from quiescent to activated HSCs ( Povero et al . , 2015 ) . The angiogenesis is a key pathological feature in the progression to NASH , particularly the development of fibrosis . Hepatocyte - derived EVs can as proangiogenic factor and induce endothelial cell migration and tube formation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo in a process requiring VNN1 - dependent internalization ( Povero et al . , 2013 ) . Hepatic non - parenchymal cell - derived EVs are also contributed to the pathogenesis and progression of NAFLD . For instance , activated HSCs - derived EVs mediated its FIGURE 2 | Extracellular vesicles in the development of alcoholic liver disease ( ALD ) . Alcohol exposure in the liver can increase the number of circulating EVs . Some biomolecules loaded by EVs are upregulated , acting on target cells [ such as macrophages , endothelial cells , and hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) ] and promoting inflammation and fibrosis . The release of circulating EVs containing a high level of these biomolecules is related to the progression of ALD to their inflammatory and more aggressive forms alcoholic steatohepatitis ( ASH ) . Wu et al . EV in NAFLD and ALD Frontiers in Physiology | www . frontiersin . org 6 July 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 707429 intercellular transfer to other quiescent or activated HSCs and these EVs were enriched with the connective tissue growth factor ( CCN2 ) , which may cause enhancement or fine tuning of fibrogenic signaling in response to chronic liver injury ( Charrier et al . , 2014 ) . Endothelial cell - derived EVs could regulate the phenotype and migration of HSCs via transfer of sphingosine kinase 1 ( SK1 ) and its product S1P ( Wang et al . , 2015 ) . Taken together , EVs released from stressed / injured hepatocytes target liver non - parenchymal cells such as macrophages and HSCs , linking lipotoxicity with events such as inflammation and fibrosis , which are associated with the progression of NAFLD to NASH . In addition , hepatic non - parenchymal cell - derived EVs are also contributed to the development of NAFLD . We have summarized the EVs in NASH in Figure 3 . THE THERAPEUTIC AND DIAGNOSTIC POTENTIAL OF EVS IN NAFLD AND ALD EVs Based Therapeutics for NAFLD and ALD From the perspective of disease treatment , unmodified or engineered EVs can be used as therapeutics for liver diseases . The therapeutic potential of EVs has become a hot research topic recently ( Murphy et al . , 2019 ) . Due to the inherent regenerative capacity of liver tissue and the tropism of systemic injection of nanovesicles in this organ , the liver is an ideal target for EVs based therapy ( Borrelli et al . , 2018 ) . Currently , EVs based therapy on liver diseases are still in preclinical stage and in most of these studies , EVs are derived from mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ; Driscoll et al . , 2021 ) . EVs from amnion - derived MSCs may improve inflammation and fibrogenesis in rat models of NASH and liver fibrosis by attenuating the activation of HSC and Kupffer cells ( Ohara et al . , 2018 ) . EVs form human liver stem cells showed similar beneficial effects in mouse model of NASH ( Bruno et al . , 2020b ) . Our own study confirmed that myeloid - specific IL - 6 induces myeloid cells to release miR - 223 - enriched EVs , which are then targeted to hepatocytes to attenuate NAFLD - associated fibrosis ( Hou et al . , 2020 ) . In addition , induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSC ) - derived EVs could be internalized by HSCs and exerted anti - fibrotic effects . These iPSC - EVs contained several specific miRNAs ( such as miR - 92a - 3p and miR - 302 - 3p ) , which can inhibit fibrogenesis ( Povero et al . , 2019 ) . These are unmodified EVs directly used as therapeutic agents . In terms of ALD treatment , EVs based therapy has not been extensively studied . There were some clues that using small molecule compounds to regulate biogenesis and release EVs may benefit ALD . For instance , CYP2E1 inhibitor chlormethiazole efficiently blocked the elevated EVs release from hepatocytes in response to alcohol ( Cho et al . , 2018 ) . Most of engineered EVs use different methods to load the required goods such as specific biomolecules and small molecule drugs into EVs for targeted therapy ( Wu et al . , 2021 ) . In terms of EVs as vehicles for small molecule drugs , EVs - mediated miRNA - 122 inhibitors use RNA interference to prevent the pro - inflammatory EVs produced by alcohol - treated hepatocytes ( Momen - Heravi et al . , 2015a ) . However , the number of studies on this treatment is quite limited in the areas of NAFLD . FIGURE 3 | Extracellular vesicles in the development of non - alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . During the process of lipotoxicity , a large number of EVs released from liver carry inflammatory molecules to liver non - parenchymal cells ( macrophages , HSCs , and endothelial cell ) , which can promote liver inflammation , angiogenesis , and fibrosis . Wu et al . EV in NAFLD and ALD Frontiers in Physiology | www . frontiersin . org 7 July 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 707429 Extracellular vesicles have broad prospects in the therapeutic field . They have the ability to overcome natural obstacles , their inherent cell targeting properties , and their stability in the circulation ( Vader et al . , 2016 ) . However , EVs - based therapeutics face several remaining challenges , such as large - scale EVs production and safety issue ( Bruno et al . , 2020a ) . Therefore , due to these current significant limitations , there is still a long way to go for EVs to have clinical translational utility . EVs as Biomarkers for NAFLD and ALD As mentioned above , the total number of circulating EVs was significantly increased in patients with various liver diseases . Based on the stability of EVs , it exists in most body fluids and iconic cargoes such as nucleic acid and protein , so it has the potential to be a circulating biomarker ( Szabo and Momen - Heravi , 2017 ) . Numerous studies have therefore investigated the potential applications of EVs - based diagnostic markers in the field of NAFLD and ALD . For instance , CD14 + macrophage / monocytes and iNKT derived EVs can be used as markers of the severity of liver injury and fibrosis in NAFLD patients ( Kornek et al . , 2012 ) . Serum EVs miR - 192 - 5p can be used as a potential noninvasive biomarker for disease progression of NAFLD ( Liu et al . , 2020 ) . Additionally , EVs miR - 122 and miR - 192 can as a biomarker for the diagnosis of advanced NAFLD or NASH in serum from NAFLD patients ( Lee et al . , 2017 ) . For ALD , circulating miRNAs in EVs can be used to distinguish liver injury in different mouse models including ALD , drug induced liver injury and inflammatory liver damage ( Bala et al . , 2012 ) . Furthermore , in human alcoholic hepatitis ( AH ) patients , miRNA - 192 and miRNA - 30a in EVs were significantly increased in the plasma ( Momen - Heravi et al . , 2015b ) . The APAP - and ethanol - induced liver injury increased the amounts of liver - specific proteins ( e . g . , GST , ALB , HP , and FGB ) in circulating EVs , which can served as reliable and noninvasive biomarkers ( Cho et al . , 2017a ) . Notably , the latest research shows that the number of circulating EVs and their sphingolipid cargoes can be used very powerful biomarker to distinguish AH from heavy drinkers , decompensated alcohol - associated cirrhosis and other end - stage liver diseases . The incorporation of circulating EVs concentration and sphingolipid cargo with traditional Model for End Stage Liver Disease score provided a better performance in predicting 90 - day mortality of AH patients ( Sehrawat et al . , 2021 ) . These findings indicated that EVs together with other biomarkers can potentially serve as a more powerful and accurate tool for diagnosis . CONCLUSION In recent years , EVs in the field of metabolic liver disease has gathered significant traction . During lipotoxicity and alcohol exposure , EVs are released in large quantities through different mechanisms . These EVs plays a key role in the transmission of information between different cell types in the liver . They can change the function of target cells and activate different pathways , thereby promoting the occurrence , pathogenesis and development of NAFLD and ALD . Understanding these issues will help us to understand the mechanism of disease and study potential therapeutic interventions . EVs may provide new clues for the therapeutic and diagnosis , but this field is still in its infancy . With more research on EVs , it is believed that EVs can be successfully used in the treatment and clinical diagnosis of NAFLD / ALD in the near future .
