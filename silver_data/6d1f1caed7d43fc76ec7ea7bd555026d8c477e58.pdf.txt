Negative Stances Detection from Multilingual Data Streams in Low - resource Languages on Social Media using BERT and CNN based Transfer Learning Model SANJAY KUMAR , Department of Computer Science and Engineering , Delhi Technological University , India Online social media allows users to connect with a large number of people across the globe and facilitate the exchange of information eiciently . These platforms cater to many of our day - to - day needs . However , at the same time , social media have been increasingly used to transmit negative stances like derogatory language , hate speech , and cyberbullying . The task of identifying the negative stances from social media posts or comments , or tweets is termed negative stance detection . One of the major challenges associated with negative stance detection is that most of the content published on social media is often in a multi - lingual format . This work aims to identify negative stances from multilingual data streams in low - resource languages on social media using a hybrid transfer learning and deep convolutional neural network approach . The proposed work strats by preprocessing the multi - lingual datasets by removing irrelevant information like special characters , hyperlinks , etc . The processed dataset is then passed through a pre - trained BERT ( bidirectional encoder representations from transformers ) model to generate embeddings by ine - tuning the model as per the dataset under consideration . The generated word embeddings are then passed to a deep convolutional neural network for extracting the latent features from the texts and removing the unessential information . This helps our model to achieve robustness and efectiveness for eicient learning on the given dataset and make appropriate predictions on zero - shot data . The paper utilizes several optimization strategies for examining the impact of ine - tuning diferent BERT layers on the model’s performance . ntensive experiments on a variety of languages , namely , English , French , Italian , Danish , Arabic , Spanish , Indonesian , German , and Portuguese are performed . The experimental results demonstrate the efectiveness and eiciency of the proposed framework .

Identifying the legitimacy of any fact shared on social media is a challenging task in the scattered and diverse social media environment with global outreach . In the United States , for example , there has been a substantial increase in inciting hatred and related crime since Trump’s election . As a result , authorities and social media outlets dealing with the trend must - have techniques for detecting violent behavioral patterns , and negative speech in speciic , because these forms of online aggressiveness not only contaminate the society of the internet communities in which they occur , but they can also lead to physical abuse , and severe damage [ 11 , 31 ] . The topic of detecting cyber abuse has recently garnered scholarly interest .

Process . 2 • Trovato and Tobin , et al . In this study , we mainly concentrate on the term " hate speech " as objectionable social media content because it may be used to represent a wide spectrum of defamatory consumer content . Any message that targets an individual or a group of people is considered hate speech based on characteristics such as orientation , sex , gender , nationality , religion , race , or other considerations [ 20 ] . Misclassifying everyday communication as hate speech can have a severe inluence on individuals’ freedom of thought and reputation , whilst misclassifying hostile talks as unproblematic would keep online communities’ position as hazardous areas . A big number of researchers have focused on using NLP in conjunction with ML and Deep Learning technologies to detect online hate speech [ 37 ] . Although diferent text mining - based features have been used in supervised machine learning - based approaches , such as surface features , sentiment classiication , knowledge - based features , lexical assets , linguistic attributes , or consumer - based and platform - based data , they all require a well - deined feature extraction methodology [ 28 ] Deep learning methods are now being used for feature extraction as well as classiier training , which looks to be bucking the trend . These latest models use deep learning methods like CNN , LSTMs , and others to enhance hate speech classiication models’ eiciency , and yet they still lack labeled training data and are unable to improve generalization features [ 38 ] . In the modern world , where negative stances are not conined to one language , let’s say India might be getting hate from Spain , Portugal , and France hence making it a very diicult situation to deal with . Within the NLP community , there have been many eforts to deal with hate speech Detection , but multilingual hate speech detection has been a challenging task in the community . Many Researchers are making eforts towards solving this problem using multiple techniques [ 14 ] . One of the major challenges with detecting negative stances on social media is that social media content is often available in multi - lingual formats with a mix of local slang and dialects . Thus in this paper , we propose a multi - lingual hybrid approach for negative stance detection from multilingual data streams in low - resource languages on social media . We use a mix of the pre - trained BERT model and deep CNN architectures . We start by preprocessing the collected dataset ; this involves removing the unnecessary text from the dataset , like special characters , URLs , etc . This cleaned dataset is then translated into the English language to obtain uniformity across the datasets . The translated dataset is then passed through another batch of preprocessing functions like lowercasing , removing stopwords , stemming , lemmatization , etc . This gives us clean and processed datasets in all the languages translated into the English language . The processed datasets are then passed through a pre - trained BERT model to generate feature embeddings for the words in our datasets . The BERT model is ine - tuned on the datasets under consideration to it our problem statement more appropriately . The generated feature embeddings are then passed through a deep CNN layer to extract the latent features and remove the irrelevant noise in the dataset . Such intensive feature generation and extraction help our model to be robust and efective in eiciently focusing on learning the essential features from the datasets and adequately using it on zero - shot test data . We also study the impact of ine - tuning techniques on various layers of the BERT architecture for generating feature embeddings . Our indings indicate that integrating contextual and syntactical content from all of BERT’s transformers to ine - tune the pre - trained BERT model on the downstream task gives the best results . We perform intensive experiments on nine real - life low - resource language datasets belonging to English , French , Italian , Danish , Arabic , Spanish , Indonesian , German , and Portuguese language . We evaluate various standard performance metrics and compare the performance of our model with several contemporary language negative stance detection methods . The experimental results demonstrate the efectiveness and utility of our model . The major contributions of this work can be summarised below . ( 1 ) A multi - lingual hybrid approach for negative stance detection from multilingual data streams in low - resource languages on social media is introduced . ( 2 ) The proposed work intends to provide a generalized framework that can be used with the content of any language like English , French , Italian , Danish , Arabic , Spanish , Indonesian , German , and Portuguese .

With a considerable increase in accuracy , our proposed approach outperforms diferent current state - of - the - art approaches . 2 LITERATURE REVIEW This section provides relevant insight into the ield and topic of hate speech analysis and both the traditional and current methodologies being used for the same . Negative stances had been a means of promoting and engaging in unpleasant and violent acts against a person or a group of persons . These can and are frequently related with and depending on sex , religion , race , and other factors . There had been a continuous increase in hateful content online , particularly on social media platforms , over the last decade , and various studies had been undertaken in response to harmful and hateful information online . This negative content is very widely available in datasets in a large number of languages , popularly but not limited to English [ 9 , 20 ] . Early works such as by Sood So et al . [ 33 ] made use of keyword - based classiiers where the prediction was hinged on a list of profane words . Davidson et al . [ 8 ] in the study however found a mismatch between hateful tweets and their corresponding ratings , suggesting improvement in keyword approaches . As a baseline work , Waseem et al . [ 37 ] utilized a number of diferent features on their annotated corpus of English tweets from the Twitter dataset which identiied n - grams as the most indicative feature . The study also suggested using speciic independent words for every target group . From a classiication point of view in Indonesian Tweets , Elisabeth et al . [ 11 ] made use of many algorithms such as SVM ( Support Vector Machine ) , Naive Bayes , and Logistic Regression . The Twitter dataset throughout was observed to be a reliable source for research . Şahi et al . [ 31 ] made use of Twitter to ilter out potential harmful and hateful content towards women using ive diferent machine learning models on Turkish tweets . The advancement in the ield encouraged many intensive approaches for the task of ofensive content analysis , which included both traditional machine learning approaches [ 10 , 16 , 21 , 24 , 32 ] and the recently trending , state - of - the - art deep learning methodologies such as Glove [ 22 ] , Bi - LSTM [ 36 ] , etc . Gambäck et al . [ 12 ] introduced a deep learning - based Twitter hate - speech text identiication using CNN and word embedding . Each tweet is categorized by the classiier into one of the four pre - established groups : racism , sexism , a combination of both , or non - hate - speech . Ziqi et al . [ 38 ] applied LSTM and a variety of diferent strategies to detect hazardous and objectionable information . Beatty [ 2 ] focused on examining models that can identify the propagation of hate speech on Twitter by analyzing its dissemination through the network graph . An important task is to incorporate techniques for hate speech study for languages other than English as well . To accomplish this , two primary ways are adopted . The irst includes translating the text written in the non - English language to English and then applying an algorithm for the analysis and study . A challenge that many researchers faced was the lack of well - labeled datasets and continuously changing and evolving vocabulary in a particular language of study . Melton et al . [ 19 ] created an ensemble of advanced deep learning models that synergistically utilize the best aspects of the state - of - the - art techniques . They integrated a tuning factor into ACM Trans .

[ 18 ] created a dataset of 10 , 224 Turkish tweets that contain hate speech was created and made available to the public . These tweets were categorized as either ofensive , hate speech , or neither , and the tweets that were identiied as hate speech were further classiied into subcategories . Corazza et al . [ 6 ] proposed a GRU and LSTM based neural network architecture for hate speech detection with satisfactory performance across multiple languages , speciically English , Italian , and German . They conducted a comprehensive analysis of the experimental outcomes for the three languages to gain a better understanding of the various components used in the system . Khan et al . [ 15 ] introduced hate speech detection in Roman Urdu and collected over 90 , 000 tweets and carefully examined them to discover 5 , 000 Roman Urdu tweets . To assess the efectiveness of hate speech detection , they applied ive supervised learning techniques , including a deep learning method . The indings indicate that Logistic Regression outperformed all other methods . The OptNet - Fake named model introduced a hybrid architecture that combines a meta - heuristic algorithm for feature selection based on their usefulness , and a deep neural network for the purpose of detecting fake news on social media platforms [ 17 ] . Ghosal and Jain [ 13 ] introduced Hindi and Bengali hate content detection framework to identify the hate orientation associated with each term , utilizing co - occurrence patterns of words , contextual semantics , and emotion analysis . Based upon a variety of techniques , it served as a basis of understanding and foundational stone for this work using transfer learning [ 25 , 29 ] approach on multilingual detection of negative stances like ofensive , cyberbullying , and hate speech . This paper build upon the foundations of transfer learning and BERT - based features on multiple datasets rich in diverse languages and compared the results with trending and reliable approaches for negative stance detection . 3 PROPOSED WORK In this section , we illustrate our proposed multi - lingual hybrid approach for negative stance detection from multilingual data streams in low - resource languages on social media . To begin the process , the initial phase involves preprocessing the data , wherein it is cleaned and translated into English . This initial step holds signii - cance in ensuring data consistency across various datasets , as well as facilitating easier processing and analysis . By eliminating irrelevant information and noise , the data becomes more streamlined and is prepared for the subsequent stage , which involves extracting features . The feature vectors generated by BERT are then processed further using a deep CNN architecture . CNNs have proven to be highly suitable for extracting features from sequential data , like text , and have demonstrated efectiveness in sentiment analysis tasks . Utilizing a CNN architecture enables the model to unveil concealed relationships and contextual nuances within the dataset’s contents . This step holds signiicance in enhancing the model’s accuracy in detecting negative stances , particularly in scenarios involving intricate language or ambiguous context . Finally , the features extracted from the CNN architecture are utilized to classify social media content based on its negative or positive stance . This classiication is achieved by training a binary classiier on the extracted features and assessing its performance through validation set testing . By leveraging the synergies between BERT and CNN architectures , the proposed methodology demonstrates efective detection of negative stances in multilingual data streams , especially in low - resource languages within social media . The incorporation of pre - trained models and transfer learning techniques empowers the model to learn from diverse data and adapt to novel languages and contexts . Deep learning techniques , such as BERT and CNN architectures , enable the model to uncover concealed dependencies and contextual cues that conventional machine learning approaches might overlook . In summary , the proposed approach serves as a robust tool for sentiment analysis and stance detection in multilingual social media data streams . It amalgamates the strengths of various inluential deep learning techniques while ofering lexibility and adaptability to diferent languages and contexts . By identifying ACM Trans .

The low diagram of our proposed model is shown in Fig . 1 . Fig . 1 . Flow diagram for our proposed multi - lingual hybrid approach for negative stance detection from multilingual data streams in low - resource languages on social media . 3 . 1 Data Preprocessing In this step , we collect data from various online sources and recent publications that are benchmarked and widely used in the literature . However , these datasets can exhibit substantial disparities , both in terms of language , style , syntax , and semantics . To establish consistency across these datasets , it becomes necessary to preprocess them prior to employing them for negative stance detection on social media . The preprocessing step commences by ACM Trans . Asian Low - Resour . Lang . Inf . Process . 6 • Trovato and Tobin , et al . eliminating unnecessary noise , special characters , URLs , and other irrelevant information present in the datasets . This is crucial for streamlining the data and enhancing its analytical tractability . Subsequently , the cleaned datasets are subjected to translation into the English language through the utilization of machine translation tools . This aids in creating a cohesive collection of datasets that share linguistic and stylistic similarities , encompassing both syntactic and semantic aspects . By carrying out translation into English , we ensure that the data is presented in a standardized format that facilitates smoother processing and analysis . Additionally , this step helps overcome the challenges associated with working with low - resource languages , wherein existing language models and resources may be scarce or unavailable . Through the translation of data into a widely employed language like English , we gain the advantage of utilizing existing language models and resources , consequently enhancing the accuracy of our negative stance detection model . Overall , the data preprocessing step is essential for ensuring that the input data is in a standardized format that can be more easily processed and analyzed . By eliminating irrelevant information and translating the data into a commonly used language , we establish uniformity in the dataset , rendering it suitable for feature extraction using BERT and CNN architectures . This step plays a crucial role in achieving exceptional accuracy in negative stance detection on social media , especially in the case of low - resource languages . 3 . 2 Feature Generation by Fine - Tuning BERT After preprocessing the datasets , the next step is to generate feature vectors for the items in the datasets , which can be used by our deep learning framework for negative stance detection on social media . To generate these feature vectors , we use a state - of - the - art language model called Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers ( BERT ) . We use the pre - trained BERT - base model , which is trained on a large corpus of English text , including the English Wikipedia and the Book Corpus containing 2 , 500M tokens . This pre - trained model is used as a starting point because it has already learned to represent the semantic and syntactic features of the English language . However , since this model is not speciically trained for negative stance detection on social media , it lacks the task - speciic details required for our datasets . To integrate the negative - stance speciic details into the feature vectors generated by the BERT model , we ine - tune the pre - trained model on our datasets . Fine - tuning involves training the pre - trained model on our speciic datasets to capture the task - speciic features required for negative stance detection . This process generates a language model that has lower layers that are more generalized to capture the syntax and semantics of the language , while the top layers capture information speciic to the problem statement under consideration , i . e . , negative stance detection on social media . The ine - tuning step for the pre - trained BERT model on our speciic datasets is represented by Eq . 1 .  = argmin   ︁  = 1  (  ,   ,   ) ( 1 ) Where  is the set of model parameters ,   is the  th input example in the dataset ,   is its corresponding label ( i . e . , positive or negative stance ) ,  is the total number of examples in the dataset , and  (  ,   ,   ) is the loss function that measures the diference between the predicted and actual labels for the input example . The ine - tuning process is crucial for achieving high accuracy in negative stance detection , particularly in low - resource languages where pre - existing language models and resources may not be available . By ine - tuning the BERT model on our speciic datasets , we can ensure that the model is optimized for our task and is capable of generating accurate feature vectors for each item in the dataset . These feature vectors will then be further processed using a deep CNN architecture to uncover the hidden dependencies and contexts among the contents of the datasets , which will enable us to classify social media content as bearing a negative or positive stance . The process of generating feature vectors using the ine - tuned BERT model is presented below in Eq . 2 . ACM Trans . Asian Low - Resour . Lang . Inf . Process .

The output of this equation is a feature vector that captures the semantic and syntactic features of the input example , including the task - speciic details required for negative stance detection on social media . The entire process of generating feature vectors by ine - tuning the BERT model is represented in Fig . 2 . Fig . 2 . Flow diagram for feature generation by fine - tuning BERT 3 . 3 Feature Processing using Deep CNN Architecture The generated feature vectors in the previous are processed further in this step to reveal the dependencies and contexts of the social media content in the datasets . Here , instead of using just the inal feature vectors generated by the last output layer of the BERT model , we stack and use the output generated by all the layers . To put it more ACM Trans . Asian Low - Resour . Lang . Inf . Process . 8 • Trovato and Tobin , et al . clearly , the outputs of all transformer encoders are used instead of the output of the most recent transformer encoder . As a result , each transformer encoder’s output vectors are concatenated , and a matrix is created . The generated feature matrix is then passed through a deep CNN architecture to apply step - wise convolutions and pooling . This generates a one - dimensional feature vector of size 768 , which is used in the next layer for classifying the social media content as bearing negative stance or not . Let  = [  1 ,  2 , . . . ,   ] be the input feature vectors generated in the previous step , where  is the number of input feature vectors and   ∈ R 768 . The output of each transformer encoder  is denoted as   = [  1 ,  2 , . . . ,   ] , where   ∈ R 768 . The concatenated feature matrix  is given by :  = [  1 ,  2 , . . . ,   ] ( 3 ) Where  is the number of transformer encoders used in the BERT model . The output of the deep CNN architecture is denoted as  , and it is calculated by applying step - wise convolutions and pooling to the feature matrix  :  =     (     (  ) ) ( 4 ) Where     ( · ) denotes the convolution operation , and     ( · ) denotes the pooling operation . Finally , the output vector  ∈ R of size 1 is obtained by passing the one - dimensional feature vector  through a classiication layer :  =  (   +  ) ( 5 ) Where  ∈ R 1 × 768 and  ∈ R are the weights and bias of the classiication layer , respectively , and  ( · ) is the sigmoid activation function . This is shown in Fig . 3 . 3 . 4 Motivation behind combining BERT and CNN feature The reason for using two diferent types of features extracted from BERT and CNN in our proposed methodology is to leverage the unique strengths and capabilities of each approach for the task of negative stance detection in multilingual data streams on social media . BERT ( Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers ) is a powerful language model that captures contextual information and semantic relationships within a given text . By ine - tuning BERT on the multilingual datasets , we enable it to learn the speciic characteristics and patterns related to negative stances in low - resource languages on social media . BERT generates high - dimensional contextualized word embeddings that efectively represent the meaning and sentiment of the text . CNNs ( Convolutional Neural Networks ) are well - suited for extracting features from sequential data , such as text . They excel at capturing local patterns and detecting important n - gram features that contribute to the overall sentiment and stance of the text . By using a deep CNN architecture , the model can uncover hidden dependencies and contexts among the contents of the datasets , especially in cases where the language is complex or the context is ambiguous . The CNN component allows the model to extract relevant features and enhance its ability to detect negative stances accurately . By combining the BERT - based and CNN - based feature extraction , we harness the complementary strengths of both approaches . BERT efectively captures the overall semantic meaning and sentiment of the text , while the CNN excels at uncovering local patterns and dependencies . Through this two - step feature extraction process , the model becomes adept at capturing both the global and local contextual information , thereby augmenting its proiciency in comprehending and efectively detecting negative stances . Moreover , the utilization of BERT - based features imparts a degree of language transferability . As BERT has been trained on an extensive corpus of multilingual data , it exhibits the capability to capture language - speciic nuances and adapt to diverse low - resource languages . On the other hand , the CNN - based features enable the model to capture task - speciic local patterns that may not ACM Trans . Asian Low - Resour . Lang . Inf . Process . Negative Stances Detection from Multilingual Data Streams in Low - resource Languages on Social Media using BERT and CNN based Transfer Learning Model • 9 Fig . 3 . Flow diagram for feature processing using deep CNN architecture . be fully captured by the pre - trained BERT model alone . Hence , by integrating these two categories of features , our proposed methodology capitalizes on the rich contextual representations ofered by BERT and the pattern detection capabilities of CNNs . This synergistic amalgamation signiicantly enhances the overall performance of the model for negative stance detection in multilingual data streams on social media , particularly when dealing with low - resource languages . 3 . 5 Detecting Negative Stance using DNN Classifier The deep neural network ( DNN ) classiier is the inal step in our proposed approach for detecting negative stances from multilingual data streams in low - resource languages on social media . In this step , we pass the inal processed feature vectors to a fully - connected DNN , which is trained to classify the social media content as either bearing negative stance or not . The DNN classiier extensively explores the latent dependencies and relationships amongst the features of the feature vectors . By doing so , it can uncover hidden patterns and nuances in the social ACM Trans . Asian Low - Resour . Lang . Inf . Process . 10 • Trovato and Tobin , et al . media content that might indicate a negative stance . This continuous and rigorous processing and investigation over the previous steps helps our framework to better detect the stance of the social media content and classify it accurately . We use a binary cross - entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer to train the DNN classiier . The accuracy and other performance metrics of the DNN classiier are evaluated using standard metrics such as precision , recall , and F1 - score . Overall , the DNN classiier is a critical component of our proposed approach , as it helps to ensure that the inal output of our framework is reliable , accurate , and useful for various applications , such as sentiment analysis and opinion mining . Let  = [  1 ,  2 , . . . ,   ] be the input feature vectors generated in the previous step , where  is the number of input feature vectors and   ∈ R 768 . The fully - connected DNN classiier is denoted as  ( · ) , and it maps the input feature vectors  to a probability score  ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] that indicates the likelihood of the social media content bearing a negative stance :  =  (  ) ( 6 ) The DNN classiier is trained by minimizing the binary cross - entropy loss function  :  = − 1   ︁  = 1 [   log (   ) + ( 1 −   ) log ( 1 −   ) ] ( 7 ) Where   ∈ 0 , 1 is the ground truth label of the  - th social media content , and  is the total number of social media content . The Adam optimizer is used to update the weights of the DNN classiier during training :   + 1 =   −  ˆ   √ ˆ   +  ( 8 ) Where   is the weight vector at iteration  ,  is the learning rate , ˆ   and ˆ   are the estimates of the irst and second moments of the gradients , respectively , and  is a small value added for numerical stability . 4 DATASETS AND PERFORMANCE MATRICES In this section , we discuss the various datasets and performance metrics used by us for this study . We use a total of nine datasets of varying languages and several benchmarked performance metrics to evaluate and estimate the performance of our model . 4 . 1 Dataset Description For our study , we use a total of nine datasets belonging to belonging to English , French , Italian , Danish , Arabic , Spanish , Indonesian , German , and Portuguese language .

These provide a consistent and clear view of the work and make it relatively simple and straightforward to compare with traditional and state - of - the - art methodologies . The metrics are deined as follows . ACM Trans . Asian Low - Resour . Lang . Inf . Process . Negative Stances Detection from Multilingual Data Streams in Low - resource Languages on Social Media using BERT and CNN based Transfer Learning Model • 13 ( 1 ) Precision - It gives a measure of how good the model is when looking at the total predicted positives and can be used to identify when a model is predicting false positives , making it closely related to false positives .          = True Positive True Positive + False Positive ( 9 ) ( 2 ) Recall - recall gives a measure of how good the model is when dealing with total actual positives and serves as a great metric for the evaluation of false negatives .       = True Positive True Positive + False Negative ( 10 ) ( 3 ) F1 score - It acts as a balancing metric between both precision and recall .  1      = Precision x Recall Precision + Recall ( 11 ) 5 RESULT AND ANALYSIS In this section , we present the results of our study on negative stance detection from multilingual social media data using a BERT and CNN - based transfer learning model . We performed extensive experiments on real - life datasets in English , French , Italian , Danish , Arabic , Spanish , Indonesian , German , and Portuguese , as mentioned in Section 4 . 1 . We evaluated the performance of our model using various benchmarked performance metrics , as mentioned in Section 4 . 2 . This allowed us to determine the efectiveness of our proposed approach in detecting negative stances in multilingual social media content . In addition , we compared the performance of our model with several baseline algorithms , including SVM , SGD , LR , Glove + CNN , and Bi - LSTM , to gain a more comparative study . Furthermore , we compared the performance of our model with several contemporary negative stance detection algorithms , including Chu et al . [ 5 ] , Saeed et al . [ 30 ] , Chakrabarty et al . [ 4 ] , Anand et al . [ 1 ] , and Van et al . [ 35 ] . The necessary hyper - parameters are performed for various comparing models along with the proposed model . The baseline algorithms were ine - tuned to give their best performance . Speciically , for Support Vector Machines ( SVM ) , we utilized a Radial basis function kernel with a Penalty parameter ( C ) set to 10 and a gamma coeicient of 0 . 0001 . In case of Stochastic Gradient Descent ( SGD ) , the learning rate was set to 0 . 01 and elasticnet regularization term with an alpha coeicient of 0 . 1 was assigned . We selected a learning rate of 0 . 01 and employed L1 regularization with the solver liblinear for logistic regression . In order to manage the level of regularization , a penalty parameter value of 0 . 01 was assigned . The Glove + CNN approach incorporated GloVe word embeddings with a dimensionality of 300 . This architecture was paired with a Convolutional Neural Network ( CNN ) architecture , utilizing a ilter size of 5 , Max pooling as the pooling strategy , a dropout rate of 0 . 25 , a learning rate of 0 . 001 , and a batch size of 32 . For the Bidirectional Long Short - Term Memory ( Bi - LSTM ) model , embedding size was set to 300 and 128 LSTM units were utilized . For the proposed model , we used 3 convolutional layers each with ilter sizes 3 , 4 , and 5 to capture diferent n - gram features . For the BERT layer of the proposed model , we utilized 12 transformer layers , with a weight decay of 0 . 01 , and a dropout rate of 0 . 1 . The deep neural network of the proposed model has 4 layers , a dropout of 0 . 1 , and Adam as the optimizer . The experimental simulations were conducted on a personal computer equipped with an 11th - generation Intel i7 processor , the RTX 3070 graphics card , and 32 GB of RAM . All the techniques were implemented using the Python programming language , leveraging several standard Python libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow . We also utilized publicly accessible GitHub repositories for some of our experiments . The experimental results demonstrate the efectiveness and utility of our model in detecting negative stances from multilingual social media data , achieving state - of - the - art performance on the evaluated datasets .

The baseline algorithms are ine - tuned to give their best performance . The results for the Precision , Recall , and F1 scores for our proposed framework and all the chosen baseline algorithms for the real - life datasets are presented in Tab . 1 , Tab . 2 , and Tab . 3 , respectively . From Tab . 1 , we can see that the proposed model outperforms the baseline algorithms in terms of Precision scores across most of the datasets except for Germanross , Spanishpierera , French , and Arabic datasets . For Germanross dataset , our model is the worst performer while for the Germanbretschneider , our model is the best performer in terms of Precision . This shows that for the two German datasets , our model gives extreme values . From this , we can infer that our model is able to focus only on certain speciic parts of the German language and needs more ine - tuning and generalization for it . For the French dataset also , our model gives poor results , indicating the need for further improvements to accommodate the French language . Tab . 2 illustrates that our model is almost the best performer in terms of recall across all the datasets . This good performance of our model can be attributed to the appropriate feature embeddings generated by ine - tuning the pre - trained BERT model . This helps our model eiciently capture the language - speciic details of the social media content . From Tab . 3 , we can infer that our proposed framework is the best performer for all the datasets except for English and Germanross in terms of F1 Score . This can be attributed to the efective feature processing done by the deep CNN architectures . This helps our model in extracting and utilizing the latent syntactical and semantic features of the various languages . This gives our model enough understanding of the contextual information , to detect the negative stance in the social media content . 5 . 2 Comparison with Contemporary Algorithms As part of our experimental analysis , we also compare the performance of our proposed algorithm with several contemporary algorithms , namely , Chu et al . [ 5 ] , Saeed et al . [ 30 ] , Chakrabarty et al . [ 4 ] , Anand et al . [ 1 ] , and Van et al . [ 35 ] . Table 4 , Table 5 , and Table 6 present the results obtained for the various contemporary algorithms and our proposed algorithms across all the chosen datasets evaluated for Precision , Recall , and F1 Score , respectively . From the results , we can see that our proposed algorithm is the best algorithm across all the datasets and for all the performance metrics . All the contemporary algorithms come second to our work . The enhanced performance of our work can be attributed to the appropriate feature processing of the features extracted from the ine - tuning of the BERT architecture by a sophisticated multi - layer deep CNN architecture . The inal classiication made using a dense DNN architecture also helps our framework in extracting all the latent features and inally classifying the social media content as possessing a positive or negative stance .

Our approach enhances the efectiveness of negative stance detection on a given dataset and generalizes it to new datasets . To achieve this , we irst collected and pre - processed various datasets belonging to diferent languages . We then ine - tuned a BERT architecture to our problem statement to extract features from the processed datasets . These feature vectors were then passed through a deep CNN architecture to extract hidden dependencies and contexts from the datasets . The processed features were then passed through a dense DNN architecture to uncover latent features and inally classify social media content as bearing a negative or positive stance . We compared the performance of our proposed architecture with several baselines and contemporary algorithms . Our indings demonstrate that our model can detect various biases in the collection or annotation of datasets , indicating its robustness and reliability . However , we recognize that the lack of datasets with considerably large sizes and information in diferent languages , such as Arabic , German , and others , is a major challenge . Therefore , we recommend expanding the current datasets as a possible solution to this issue . Overall , our proposed approach for negative stance detection on social media can have a signiicant impact on society by enabling early detection of harmful stances , leading to the creation of a peaceful and harmonious community . We believe that our approach can be further improved and expanded upon in future studies to enhance its efectiveness and applicability in various scenarios .
