ARTICLE Synergy between Cyclase - associated protein and Co ﬁ lin accelerates actin ﬁ lament depolymerization by two orders of magnitude Shashank Shekhar 1 , 2 , 3 , Johnson Chung 3 , Jane Kondev 2 , Jeff Gelles 3 * & Bruce L . Goode 1 * Cellular actin networks can be rapidly disassembled and remodeled in a few seconds , yet in vitro actin ﬁ laments depolymerize slowly over minutes . The cellular mechanisms enabling actin to depolymerize this fast have so far remained obscure . Using micro ﬂ uidics - assisted TIRF , we show that Cyclase - associated protein ( CAP ) and Co ﬁ lin synergize to processively depolymerize actin ﬁ lament pointed ends at a rate 330 - fold faster than spontaneous depo - lymerization . Single molecule imaging further reveals that hexameric CAP molecules interact with the pointed ends of Co ﬁ lin - decorated ﬁ laments for several seconds at a time , removing approximately 100 actin subunits per binding event . These ﬁ ndings establish a paradigm , in which a ﬁ lament end - binding protein and a side - binding protein work in concert to control actin dynamics , and help explain how rapid actin network depolymerization is achieved in cells . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13268 - 1 OPEN 1 Department of Biology , Brandeis University , Waltham , MA 02454 , USA . 2 Department of Physics , Brandeis University , Waltham , MA 02454 , USA . 3 Department of Biochemistry , Brandeis University , Waltham , MA 02454 , USA . * email : gelles @ brandeis . edu ; goode @ brandeis . edu NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 5319 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13268 - 1 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 0 ( ) : , ; L iving cells dynamically rearrange their actin cytoskeletons in response to external signals in order to move , change shape , and reorganize their internal architecture 1 . This remodeling requires rapid actin ﬁ lament depolymerization . While this pro - cess occurs in seconds in vivo 2 , puri ﬁ ed actin ﬁ laments take minutes to depolymerize in vitro 3 , 4 . How accelerated depoly - merization is achieved in vivo has been unclear . Co ﬁ lin has long been recognized as a central player in promoting actin dis - assembly 5 – 9 . In addition to its ability to sever ﬁ laments , Co ﬁ lin modestly accelerates depolymerization under physiological con - ditions , increasing the rate of subunit loss by about 4 - fold ( to ~ 1 subunit s − 1 ) at ﬁ lament pointed ends 10 – 12 . Twin ﬁ lin , another member of the actin depolymerization factor homology ( ADF - H ) family , also enhances depolymerization at ﬁ lament ends . Yeast and mammalian Twin ﬁ lins alone can accelerate depolymerization at barbed ends , and in the presence of Cyclase - associated protein ( CAP ) , yeast Twin ﬁ lin accelerates pointed - end depolymerization by ~ 20 fold , whereas mammalian Twin ﬁ lin does not 13 , 14 . These observations have established that ADF - H proteins can catalyze shortening at ﬁ lament ends , but do not account for the estimated > 100 - fold faster actin depolymerization in vivo 15 . Thus , cellular mechanisms driving rapid pointed - end depolymerization are only partially understood . CAP , also called Srv2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , is a con - served multidomain actin - binding protein found in animals , plants , and fungi 16 . Genetic and biochemical studies have linked Srv2 / CAP to Co ﬁ lin in controlling actin dynamics and actin - based cellular processes 17 – 21 . The N - terminal half of Srv2 / CAP ( N - Srv2 / N - CAP ) self - associates to form hexameric shuriken - like ( bladed ) structures that bind to the sides of actin ﬁ laments and enhance Co ﬁ lin - induced severing by 4 – 8 fold 18 , 22 . The C - terminal half of Srv2 / CAP ( C - Srv2 / C - CAP ) dimerizes and binds with high af ﬁ nity to Co ﬁ lin - bound ADP - actin monomers , catalyzing the dissociation of Co ﬁ lin and promoting nucleotide exchange on actin monomers 17 , 19 – 21 . Functions of N - Srv2 / N - CAP in driving actin ﬁ lament turnover in vitro and in vivo depend critically on a conserved actin - binding surface on its helical - folded domain ( HFD ) 18 , 23 . This surface is also critical for the synergy between N - Srv2 and yeast Twin ﬁ lin in promoting actin depolymerization 13 . Thus , N - Srv2 / N - CAP interactions with actin ﬁ laments are crucial for its known in vitro and in vivo functions . Here we show that Srv2 / CAP synergizes with Co ﬁ lin to enhance pointed - end depolymerization by > 300 - fold , reaching speeds of up to ~ 50 subunits s − 1 . Using micro ﬂ uidics - assisted total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence ( mf - TIRF ) microscopy 24 and single - molecule imaging , we show that individual CAP hexamers interact transiently ( on average for 2 . 2 ± 0 . 2 s ) with the pointed ends of Co ﬁ lin - decorated actin ﬁ laments and remove about 100 subunits each time . Results Srv2 is an actin ﬁ lament depolymerase . Using mf - TIRF , we investigated the effects of S . cerevisiae CAP ( Srv2 ) and Co ﬁ lin ( Cof1 ) , individually and combined , at ﬁ lament pointed ends ( Fig . 1a , b ) . In these experiments , preformed ﬂ uorescently labeled actin ﬁ laments were ﬂ owed into a micro ﬂ uidic chamber and captured at their barbed ends by capping protein ( CapZ ) anchored on the glass coverslip . Actin disassembly occurs more readily after subunits undergo ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release 25 . Therefore , we incubated ﬁ laments for 15 min to allow P i release , and then exposed them to Cof1 and / or full - length Srv2 ( note : Srv2 / CAP concentrations shown always refer to the concentration of the hexamers rather than monomers ) . In control reactions , ﬁ laments depolymerized at their pointed ends at a rate of 0 . 14 ± 0 . 04 subunits s − 1 ( ±sd ) whereas ﬁ laments incubated with 1 µM Cof1 depolymerized at 0 . 43 ± 0 . 1 subunits s − 1 ( ~ 3 - fold faster ; Fig . 1c , d , Supplementary Movie 1 ) . Using ﬂ uorescently labeled Cy3 - Cof1 , we con ﬁ rmed that this concen - tration of Cof1 rapidly decorates ﬁ laments along their lengths ( Fig . 1d ) , which has been shown to prevent severing 26 , 27 . These effects of yeast Cof1 are similar to those reported for human Co ﬁ lin - 1 and ADF alone 10 , 12 . In addition , 0 . 5 µM Srv2 alone increased pointed - end depolymerization by ~ 7 - fold , to a rate of 0 . 96 ± 0 . 14 subunits s − 1 , establishing Srv2 as an actin depolymerase . Srv2 and Co ﬁ lin synergize in depolymerizing pointed ends . When we combined Srv2 and Cof1 , pointed - end depolymerization was accelerated by 330 - fold to a rate of 43 . 9 ± 6 . 0 subunits s − 1 ( Fig . 1c – e ) ( Supplementary Movie 1 ) , approaching the estimated rates of actin turnover in vivo 15 . The rate observed in vitro for Cof1 and Srv2 together far exceeded the sum of the rates observed for each protein individually , indicating that these two proteins work synergistically to depolymerize actin . Put another way , this synergy of Cof1 with Srv2 leads to ~ 100 - fold faster depolymer - ization than Cof1 alone . We then asked whether this in vitro activity can occur under physiological conditions where a high concentration of pro ﬁ lin - bound actin monomers is present ( Fig . 1f ) . Adding 3 µM actin monomers ( in presence or absence of 6 µM Pro ﬁ lin ) did not appreciably alter synergistic depolymer - ization by Srv2 and Cof1 , con ﬁ rming that Srv2 ’ s ability to interact with free actin monomers ( through its C - terminus ) does not hinder the depolymerization activities . N - Srv2 mediates synergistic depolymerization with Cof1 . Srv2 / CAP has two distinct functions in promoting actin turnover . Its hexamer - forming N - terminal half promotes ﬁ lament turnover and its dimeric C - terminal half promotes monomer recycling 16 ( Fig . 2a ) . To dissect the mechanism underlying fast synergistic depolymerization , we used a point mutant of Srv2 in the N - terminal HFD domain ( Srv2 - 90 , Fig . 2a ) that disrupts its con - served actin ﬁ lament - binding site and causes striking defects in actin organization in vivo 23 . Unlike wild - type full - length Srv2 , Srv2 - 90 failed to enhance pointed - end depolymerization in the presence of Cof1 and exhibited negligible depolymerization activity on its own ( Fig . 2b ) . Thus , direct interactions of the N - Srv2 with actin ﬁ laments are required for its depolymerization effects . We also observed that wild - type N - Srv2 and full - length Srv2 had similar depolymerization effects in the absence of Cof1 , and that N - Srv2 was suf ﬁ cient to synergize with Cof1 indis - tinguishably from full - length Srv2 ( Fig . 2c ) . Therefore , N - Srv2 accounts for the full depolymerization activity , and was used for all subsequent experiments unless otherwise speci ﬁ ed . Impor - tantly , synergistic depolymerization activity was observed at pH values spanning the physiological range ( 6 . 8 – 7 . 8 ) ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . In previous studies , we showed that S . cerevisiae Twin ﬁ lin ( Twf1 ) synergizes with N - Srv2 to enhance pointed - end depoly - merization by 17 - fold 13 . Therefore , we tested whether the depolymerization effects of S . cerevisiae Cof1 and Twf1 ( with Srv2 ) are additive . Adding Cof1 , Twf1 and N - Srv2 to ﬁ laments resulted in rapid severing , which precluded reliable measurement of depolymerization rates at the pointed ends . We speculate that Twf1 ’ s binding to ﬁ lament sides interrupts complete decoration by Cof1 , thus promoting severing . Therefore , we decided to predecorate actin ﬁ laments with Cof1 ( 1 µM ) , and then ﬂ ow in the mixture of Cof1 , Twf1 and N - Srv2 . In these experiments , severing was no longer an issue , and therefore depolymerization ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13268 - 1 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 5319 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13268 - 1 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications rates could be measured . This analysis revealed no appreciable difference in the rates of pointed - end depolymerization induced by Cof1 , Twf1 and N - Srv2 versus Cof1 and N - Srv2 ( Fig . 2d ) . Further analysis showed that at a ﬁ xed concentration of Cof1 ( 1 µM ) , N - Srv2 accelerated depolymerization in a concentration - dependent manner ( Fig . 2e , K M = 50 ± 10 nM ; k cat = 53 ± 8 sub - units s − 1 ) . This effect saturated near 150 nM N - Srv2 , still well below the total cellular concentration of Srv2 in S . cerevisiae ( 0 . 5 µM hexamers ) 13 . These kinetics suggest that at lower N - Srv2 concentrations , the rate - limiting step in depolymerization may be binding of N - Srv2 hexamers to Co ﬁ lin - saturated ﬁ laments . At higher N - Srv2 concentrations , a different step in the mechanism ( such as release of actin subunits from ﬁ lament ends ) may become rate - limiting . Reciprocally , varying Cof1 concentration over a tenfold range ( 0 . 1 – 1 µM ) at a ﬁ xed concentration of 0 . 5 µM N - Srv2 did not signi ﬁ cantly alter the depolymerization rate ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . At even lower Cof1 concentrations ( 0 . 05 µM ) , depoly - merization was slightly diminished , possibly due to incomplete decoration of ﬁ laments by Cof1 . Reducing Cof1 concentration below 0 . 05 µM led to extensive severing , which precluded reliable measurement of depolymerization rates .

Srv2 / CAP homologs show remarkable conservation across plants , animals , and fungi in their domains , structure , and interactions 16 . To address whether the synergistic depolymerization activity is conserved , we examined the activities of mammalian N - CAP1 in conjunction with mammalian Co ﬁ lins ( Co ﬁ lin - 1 or ADF ) .

These results indicate that the CAP - Co ﬁ lin synergy has been conserved across a billion years of evolution , from S . cerevisiae to mammals , and that it applies to both widely expressed isoforms of mammalian Co ﬁ lin . Srv2 / CAP and Co ﬁ lin synergy persists with phosphate present . Actin ﬁ laments age via rapid ATP hydrolysis followed by slow P i release ( 0 . 002 s − 1 ) 28 , 29 . The latter step has long been considered to be rate - limiting in ﬁ lament disassembly 29 . Further , Co ﬁ lin pre - ferentially binds to ADP - actin over ADP + P i - actin 29 , and sub - saturating concentrations of Co ﬁ lin exhibit drastically reduced severing activity in the presence of 20 mM free P i ( included to maintain ﬁ laments in the ADP + P i state ) 26 , 30 . All of our experi - ments presented so far were performed using aged ADP - actin ﬁ laments ( after P i release ) . To determine whether Srv2 and Co ﬁ lin synergy , like Co ﬁ lin alone , is sensitive to the nucleotide state of actin , we next included 20 mM P i in the depolymerization reactions to maintain ﬁ laments in the ADP + P i state . For these experiments , we increased the concentration of Cof1 to 5 µM , which allowed full decoration of ﬁ laments even in the presence of 20 mM P i ( Sup - plementary Fig . 3 ) . Remarkably , synergistic depolymerization by 0 . 5 µM N - Srv2 and 5 µM Cof1 was unaffected by the presence of 20 mM P i compared to controls lacking P i or including 20 mM SO 4 2 − ( Fig . 3b ) . Thus , the synergistic depolymerization pathway appears to bypass the normal slow P i release step in actin ﬁ lament disassembly , either by being insensitive to the presence of ﬁ lament - bound P i or by accelerating P i release from ﬁ laments . Srv2 / CAP hexamers transiently interact with pointed ends . To better understand how Srv2 synergizes with Co ﬁ lin to drive depolymerization , we performed single - molecule imaging using Cy5 - maleimide - labeled Srv2 Δ CARP molecules ( Fig . 2a ) , which have only a single cysteine per monomer . In the presence of Cof1 , Cy5 - Srv2 Δ CARP and unlabeled N - Srv2 showed similar effects on depolymerization ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Photobleaching records of surface - adsorbed Cy5 - Srv2 Δ CARP and statistical modeling indicated that 77 . 9 ± 2 . 6 % of hexamers were labeled , most with either 1 or 2 dyes ( Fig . 4a , Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . To directly observe Cy5 - Srv2 Δ CARP molecules on Cof1 - decorated ﬁ laments during depolymerization , we simultaneously imaged Alexa - 488 actin and Cy5 - Srv2 Δ CARP ( 83 nM ) at high time resolution ( 0 . 065 s per frame ) ( Supplementary Movie 2 ) . Cy5 - Srv2 Δ CARP molecules preferentially bound to the pointed ends rather than the sides of ﬁ laments ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Interactions at the pointed ends were transient , with an average dwell time of 2 . 2 ± 0 . 2 s ( Fig . 4b − d ) , translating to a Cy5 - Srv2 Δ CARP dissociation rate constant k off = 0 . 45 s − 1 . Further , the shape of the intensity distribution of the pointed end - associated Cy5 - Srv2 Δ CARP ﬂ uorescent spots ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) agreed with that predicted from the step photobleaching of surface - immobilized individual Cy5 - Srv2 Δ CARP molecules ( Sup - plementary Fig . 5 ) , suggesting that pointed end - bound molecules are single hexamers . We also determined the kinetics of Srv2 Δ CARP association with the ﬁ lament pointed end by measuring the average length of time from the end of one Cy5 - Srv2 Δ CARP binding event to the beginning of the next , and then correcting ( see Methods ) for the fraction of molecules that are unlabeled . This measurement yielded a second - order association rate constant k on = 1 . 1 ± 0 . 2 × 10 7 s − 1 M − 1 . This extremely fast rate approaches the expected diffusion - limited rate constant for a large molecule the size of a Srv2 hexamer associating with a ﬁ lament end . The single - molecule observations also provide insights into the mechanism of synergistic depolymerization . At 8 . 3 nM Cy5 - Srv2 Δ CARP , the ﬁ lament end is occupied by Srv2 only ~ 15 % of the time , and ﬁ laments depolymerize at only ~ 15 % of the maximal rate seen at saturating Srv2 concentrations ( Table 1 ) . Similarly , at 83 nM Cy5 - Srv2 Δ CARP , the ﬁ lament end is occupied ~ 65 % of the time , and ﬁ laments depolymerize at ~ 65 % of the maximal rate . This parallel between end occupancy and depolymerization rate suggests a model in which the pointed end depolymerizes rapidly when Srv2 is bound to the ﬁ lament end . Consistent with the model , at the lower ( 8 . 3 nM ) concentration of Srv2 , we observe two distinct behaviors : brief periods of rapid depolymerization interspersed with longer periods of little or no depolymerization ( Fig . 4e , red ) . The two behaviors are less obvious at 83 nM , likely because the individual Srv2 binding events are too closely spaced in time ( e . g . , Fig . 4c ) to be well resolved in the velocity data ( Fig . 4e , black ) .

However , at Srv2 concentra - tions well below K M ( Fig . 2e ) , the pointed end is occupied only a small fraction of the time , giving rise to slower rates of depolymerization . To test the model , we examined ﬁ lament depolymerization during individual Srv2 binding events . This analysis is dif ﬁ cult because the precision of actin ﬁ lament length measurement is limited in our experiments by ﬁ lament Brownian motion and partial ( 10 % ) ﬂ uorescent labeling of actin monomers .

ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13268 - 1 6 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 5319 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13268 - 1 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications depolymerization ( e . g . , Fig . 4f ) , some are not ( e . g . , Fig . 4g ) . As expected , a histogram of all depolymerization velocities measured at 8 . 3 nM Cy5 - Srv2 Δ CARP when the protein was absent from the ﬁ lament end showed a narrow peak centered close to zero ( Fig . 4h , top ) . In contrast , velocities when Cy5 - Srv2 Δ CARP was present at the end showed a broader distribution , including large velocities ( consistent with rapid depolymerization ) as well as a signi ﬁ cant number of velocities close to zero . Thus , the data in Fig . 4f − h suggest that not all single - molecule Srv2 binding events at the ﬁ lament pointed end produce rapid depolymerization . It is possible that this heterogeneity is caused by differences in the nature of Srv2 hexamer interactions with the ﬁ lament end and / or how well the end of the ﬁ lament is decorated by Cof1 . Despite the fact that we could not accurately measure depolymerization velocities during Srv2 binding events shorter than those selected for Fig . 4g , h , we could still calculate how many actin subunits were removed from the pointed end on average during each Srv2 binding event . From the saturation kinetics of pointed - end depolymerization , we calculated k cat / K M = 106 ± 27 × 10 7 actin subunits s − 1 M − 1 ( Fig . 2e ) , which is the mean number of actin subunits removed per binding event multiplied by the association rate constant 31 . The latter quantity , k on = 1 . 1 ± 0 . 2 × 10 7 s − 1 M − 1 , was measured in the single - molecule experiments described above . The ratio of these values yields the mean number of subunits removed per Srv2 Δ CARP binding event , 96 ± 30 subunits . Thus , on average each binding of an individual ~ 40 nm diameter Srv2 hexamer 20 reduces the ﬁ lament length by ~ 270 nm . Discussion Cellular actin ﬁ lament networks must be dynamically assembled and turned over , and their monomeric actin building blocks rapidly recycled for new rounds of polymerization . Two members of the ADF - homology superfamily , Co ﬁ lin and Twin ﬁ lin , have been implicated in promoting actin depolymerization 8 , 10 , 12 – 14 . Alone , Twin ﬁ lin processively tracks the barbed ends of ﬁ laments and modestly enhances their rate of depolymerization . Co ﬁ lin both severs ﬁ laments and modestly enhances the depolymeriza - tion rate at ﬁ lament ends . Neither protein alone can enhance pointed - end depolymerization to rates of depolymerization expected to occur in vivo . In this study , we have elucidated a multicomponent mechan - ism in which Co ﬁ lin and Srv2 / CAP , which individually have only modest depolymerization effects , together produce a dramatic > 300 - fold acceleration of depolymerization at ﬁ lament pointed ends . We show that Srv2 / CAP hexamers transiently bind to the pointed end of Co ﬁ lin - decorated ﬁ laments , with each binding event on average leading to the removal of about 100 actin sub - units . It is unlikely that this number of actin subunits leave in a complex with a single departing Srv2 hexamer . Instead , we pro - pose that the subunits dissociate as free actin monomers , Co ﬁ lin - bound actin monomers , and / or very short oligomers ( Fig . 5a ) . Together with previous observations , our results demonstrate that Srv2 / CAP can affect actin dynamics in four distinct ways . First , as we show here , and in agreement with earlier bulk stu - dies 17 , Srv2 / CAP alone enhances pointed - end depolymerization . Our direct observation of these effects on individual actin ﬁ la - ments by TIRF microscopy establish Srv2 / CAP as a bona ﬁ de pointed - end depolymerase . Further , our results reveal that in conjunction with ﬁ lament decoration by Co ﬁ lin , these interac - tions of Srv2 / CAP promote extraordinarily fast rates of pointed - Table 1 Comparison of ﬁ lament end occupancy by Srv2 and depolymerization rate .

In a subset of these binding events , Srv2 catalyzes the dissociation of actin subunits . Subunits might be released as actin monomers , Co ﬁ lin - bound monomers , and / or Co ﬁ lin - bound oligomers . b On ﬁ laments that are more sparsely decorated with Co ﬁ lin , Srv2 / CAP can bind to ﬁ lament sides and enhance Co ﬁ lin - mediated severing , in addition to accelerating pointed - end depolymerization of the severing products . Twin ﬁ lin interacts with ﬁ lament barbed ends to promote their depolymerization , where its interactions with Srv2 / CAP increase its processivity . The thickness of arrows indicates relative rates of polymerization or depolymerization at the two ends of the ﬁ lament .

Second , the C - terminal half of Srv2 / CAP catalyzes displacement of Co ﬁ lin from ADP - actin monomers and promotes nucleotide exchange , possibly in collaboration with its binding partner Pro ﬁ lin 17 , 19 – 21 , 32 , 33 . Our results here show that the presence of actin monomers ( with or without Pro ﬁ lin ) does not alter Srv2 / CAP synergy with Co ﬁ lin in pointed - end depoly - merization , demonstrating the potential for this depolymerization activity to occur under physiological conditions in vivo , where micromolar concentrations of pro ﬁ lin - bound actin monomers are present . Third , the N - terminal half of Srv2 increases the pro - cessivity of Twin ﬁ lin at barbed ends , resulting in longer depoly - merization runs induced by Twin ﬁ lin 13 . Fourth , N - Srv2 also enhances Co ﬁ lin - mediated severing of ﬁ laments , by directly interacting with ﬁ lament sides 18 , 22 . This occurs at lower levels of Co ﬁ lin , where ﬁ lament sides are sparsely decorated 18 . In the present study , we have shown that at higher concentrations of Co ﬁ lin , as found in vivo , Co ﬁ lin more completely decorates ﬁ lament sides , and Srv2 no longer enhances severing but pro - motes rapid pointed - end depolymerization . Depolymerization effects are mediated by N - Srv2 , and require its direct interactions with actin ﬁ laments , and are dependent on a conserved surface on the HFD domain 18 , 22 , 23 . An accompanying manuscript makes similar observations and provides the structural basis for N - Srv2 / N - CAP interactions with the pointed ends of ﬁ laments 34 . How might the two ﬁ lament - disassembling activities of Srv2 / CAP ( enhancement of severing and synergistic depolymerization ) contribute to actin turnover in vivo ? In the complex cellular milieu , there are many actin ﬁ lament side - binding proteins that compete with Co ﬁ lin , producing discontinuities in Co ﬁ lin dec - oration to promote severing 27 , 35 . When this occurs , Srv2 is likely to bind ﬁ lament sides and enhance severing , in addition to interacting with pointed ends of ﬁ laments ( including Co ﬁ lin - decorated products of severing ) and catalyze depolymerization ( Fig . 5b ) . How Twin ﬁ lin - mediated depolymerization contributes to cellular actin disassembly is not well understood , but our data suggest that Twin ﬁ lin can enhance Co ﬁ lin - mediated severing by interrupting Co ﬁ lin decoration on ﬁ lament sides . In addition , Twin ﬁ lin binds with high af ﬁ nity to Capping Protein , and Twin - ﬁ lin functions have been linked genetically and biochemically to Capping Protein 36 – 38 . Therefore , Twin ﬁ lin may have a particularly important role in controlling dynamics at barbed ends ( Fig . 5b ) . In summary , our results uncover a synergistic , conserved mechanism of actin depolymerization driven by Srv2 / CAP and Co ﬁ lin . These results establish a paradigm in which an actin ﬁ lament end - binding protein and a side - binding protein work in concert to govern actin dynamics . Further , they ﬁ ll a major gap in our understanding of how actin networks can be disassembled rapidly , and may account for the high rates of depolymerization hypothesized to occur in vivo , e . g . , at the leading edge and sites of endocytosis 2 , 39 . Methods Puri ﬁ cation and labeling of rabbit muscle actin . Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was puri ﬁ ed from acetone powder 40 generated from frozen ground hind leg muscle tissue of young rabbits ( PelFreez , Rogers , AR ) .

Actin was polymerized by the addition of 2mM MgCl 2 and 50mM NaCl and incubated overnight at 4 °C . F - actin was pelleted by centrifugation for 150 min at 361 , 000 × g , and the pellet solubilized by dounce homogenization and dialyzed against G - buffer for 48 h at 4 °C . Monomeric actin was then precleared at 435 , 000 × g , and loaded onto a S200 ( 16 / 60 ) gel - ﬁ ltration column ( GE Healthcare , Marlborough , MA ) equilibrated in G - Buffer . Fractions containing actin were stored at 4°C . For biotinylation of actin , the F - actin pellet described above was dounced and dialyzed against G - buffer lacking DTT . Monomeric actin was then polymerized by adding an equal volume of 2× labeling buffer ( 50 mM imidazole pH 7 . 5 , 200 mM KCl , 0 . 3 mM ATP , 4 mM MgCl 2 ) . After 5min , the actin was mixed with a 5 - fold molar excess of NHS - XX - Biotin ( Merck KGaA , Darmstadt , Germany ) and incubated in the dark for 15 h at 4 °C . Labeled F - actin was pelleted as above , and the pellet was rinsed brie ﬂ y with G - buffer , then by homogenized with a dounce , and depolymerized by dialysis against G - buffer for 48 h at 4 °C .

Next , the solution was centrifuged at 450 , 000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C . The supernatant was collected , and the concentration and labeling ef ﬁ ciency was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 and 495nm . Molar extinction coef ﬁ cients used were as follows : ε 280 actin = 45 , 840 M − 1 cm − 1 , ε 495 Alexa - 488 = 71 , 000 M − 1 cm − 1 and ε 280 AF488 = 7810 M − 1 cm − 1 . Puri ﬁ cation and biotinylation of SNAP tagged CapZ . SNAP - CapZ 41 was expressed in E . coli BL21 DE3 ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) by growing cells to log phase at 37 °C in TB medium , then inducing expression using 1mM IPTG at 18 °C overnight . Cells were harvested by centrifugation and pellets were stored at − 80 °C . Frozen pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer ( 20 mM NaPO 4 pH 7 . 8 , 300 mM NaCl , 1mM DTT , 15 mM imidazole , 1mM PMSF ) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail ( 0 . 5 µM each of pepstatin A , antipain , leupeptin , aprotinin , and chymostatin ) . Cells were lysed by sonication with a tip sonicator while keeping the tubes on ice . The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 150 , 000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C .

The beads were ﬁ rst washed thoroughly with washing buffer ( 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl and 1mM DTT ) to remove unbound protein and then incubated with thrombin ( 0 . 05 mg / ml ) to cleave Co ﬁ lin from bead - bound GST . The cleaved protein was recovered by centrifugation . The supernatant con - taining the protein was concentrated and loaded on to a Superose 12 gel - ﬁ ltration column ( GE Healthcare , Pittsburgh , PA ) pre - equilibrated with 10mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT .

Frozen pellets were resuspended in 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , and protease inhibitors as described above . Cells were lysed by sonication with a tip sonicator while keeping the tubes on ice . The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 150 , 000 × g for 30min at 4°C . The supernatant was loaded on a 1 ml HiTrap HP Q column ( GE ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13268 - 1 8 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 5319 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13268 - 1 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications Healthcare , Pittsburgh , PA ) , and the ﬂ ow - through was harvested and dialyzed against 20 mM HEPES pH 6 . 8 , 25mM NaCl , and 1mM DTT . The dialyzed solution was then loaded on a 1ml HiTrap SP FF column ( GE Healthcare , Pittsburgh , PA ) and eluted using a linear gradient of NaCl ( 20 – 500mM ) . Fractions containing ADF / Co ﬁ lin were concentrated , dialyzed into 20mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , and 1mM DTT , snap frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at − 80°C .

The protein was then aliquoted , snap frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at − 80 °C . For ﬂ uorescent labeling of Srv2 Δ CARP , the same procedure as above was followed with the exception that 1mM DTT in the elution buffer was replaced with 0 . 2mM Tris ( 2 - carboxyethyl ) phosphine ( TCEP ) 45 . The eluted fractions were concentrated and incubated with at least ﬁ vefold molar excess of Cy5 ‐ maleimide dye ( GE Healthcare , Pittsburgh , PA ) for 30min at 25°C and additionally for 14h at 4°C .

Peak fractions were pooled , aliquoted , snap frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at − 80 °C . Puri ﬁ cation of Pro ﬁ lin . Human Pro ﬁ lin - 1 was expressed in E . coli BL21 DE3 by growing cells to log phase at 37°C in TB medium , then inducing expression using 1mM IPTG at 37 °C for 3h . Cells were harvested by centrifugation and pellets were stored at − 80 °C . Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 1mM EDTA , 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , lysozyme + protease inhibitors as described above ) , kept on ice for 30min , and then further lysed by sonication . Lysates were cleared for 25 min at 272 , 000 × g at 4 °C , and the supernatant was collected and loaded on a HiTrap Q column ( Buffer : 20mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 ) followed by a Superdex 75 column equilibrated in 20mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM NaCl . Peak fractions were pooled , snap frozen in aliquots , and stored at − 80 °C . Micro ﬂ uidics - assisted TIRF microscopy . Actin ﬁ lament depolymerization was monitored by micro ﬂ uidics - assisted Total Internal Re ﬂ ection Microscopy ( mf - TIRF ) 12 , 24 , 46 . Coverslips were ﬁ rst cleaned by sonication in detergent for 60min , followed by successive sonications in 1 M KOH and 1M HCl for 20min each and in ethanol for 60 min . Coverslips were then washed extensively with H 2 O and dried in an N 2 stream . The cleaned coverslips were coated with a 80 % ethanol solution adjusted to pH 2 . 0 with HCl containing 2 mg / ml mPEG - silane , MW 2 , 000 and 2 μ g / ml Biotin - PEG - silane , MW 3 , 400 ( Laysan Bio Inc . , Arab , AL ) and incubated overnight at 70 °C . A 40 µm high PDMS mold with three inlets and one outlet was mechanically clamped onto a PEG - Silane coated coverslip . The chamber was then connected to Maes ﬂ ow micro ﬂ uidic ﬂ ow - control system ( Fluigent , France ) , rinsed with TIRF buffer ( 10 mM imidazole pH 7 . 4 , 50mM KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA , 0 . 2mM ATP , 10mM DTT , 15 mM glucose , 20 μ g / ml catalase , 100 μ g / ml glucose oxidase ) and incubated with 1 % BSA and 10µg / ml streptavidin in TIRF buffer for 5 min . CapZ was then anchored on the surface by ﬂ owing in 1nM biotin - SNAP - CapZ for 5min . Preformed actin ﬁ laments ( 10 % Alexa - 488 labeled ) were then introduced and captured by anchored CapZ at their barbed ends with their distal pointed ends free in solution . All experiments were carried out at room temperature in TIRF buffer . Each experiment was repeated at least three times , and yielded similar results . Data from a single replicate are presented in the ﬁ gures . Actin ﬁ laments were ﬁ rst aged to ADP - F - Actin under continuous ﬂ ow for 15 min and then exposed to speci ﬁ c biochemical conditions ( e . g . Co ﬁ lin and / or Srv2 in TIRF buffer ) . Single - and multi - wavelength time - lapse TIRF imaging were performed using a Nikon - Ti200 inverted microscope equipped with a 150 mW Ar - Laser ( Mellot Griot , Carlsbad , CA ) , a ×60 TIRF - objective with a numerical aperture of 1 . 49 ( Nikon Instruments Inc . , New York , NY ) and an EMCCD camera ( Andor Ixon , Belfast , Northern Ireland ) . One pixel was equivalent to 143 ×143 nm . During measurements , optimal focus was maintained by the Perfect Focus system ( Nikon Instruments Inc . ) . Images were corrected for background ﬂ uorescence using the Fiji 47 rolling ball background subtraction algorithm ( ball radius 5 pixels ) , analyzed using the Fiji kymograph plugin , and the kymograph slopes were measured to determine the depolymerization rates of individual ﬁ laments . One actin subunit was taken to contribute 2 . 7nm to the ﬁ lament length . Single - molecule imaging and analysis . Flow cells were formed by placing two PEG - silane biotin coated coverslips ( as described above ) orthogonally on top of each other with lines of silicone grease as a spacer . The ﬂ ow cell was then rinsed with TIRF buffer and incubated with 1 % BSA and 10 µg / ml streptavidin in TIRF buffer for 5 min . Actin ﬁ laments were anchored along their lengths were then elongated by introducing a solution containing 1 μ M G - actin ( 10 % Alexa - 488 labeled and 0 . 5 % biotinylated ) and 4 μ M Pro ﬁ lin . The ﬂ ow cell was then rinsed with TIRF buffer to remove free monomers . These ﬁ laments were then exposed to a mixture of Cy5 - Srv2 Δ CARP and yeast Cof1 in TIRF buffer . The ﬂ ow cell was excited by 488 nm ( 0 . 15 mW ) and 633 nm ( 1 mW ) lasers simultaneously and imaged on a micro - mirror TIRF microscope 48 by spectrally separating the emission with a 635 long - pass ﬁ lter . Images were acquired continuously ( 65 or 100 ms integration time ) using custom - written LabVIEW software ( GLIMPSE ; https : / / github . com / gelles - brandeis / Glimpse ) and captured by an EMCCD camera ( Andor Ixon Ultra ) . One pixel was equivalent to 130 × 130 nm . For image processing , the pointed - end of an actin ﬁ lament was tracked using a thresholding algorithm ( Supplementary Movie 3 ) written in MATLAB . The integrated intensity in the Cy5 - Srv2 Δ CARP channel was determined in a 5 ×5 pixel box drawn at the location of the pointed end of the ﬁ lament . The integrated intensity values were background corrected by subtracting the sum of 25 median pixel intensity values collected from the perimeter of a 19 pixel by 19 pixel square centered on the area of interest . The average intensity over time was smoothed using a moving window of 0 . 71s ( second - order polynomial , Savitzky - Golay ﬁ lter ) ( Fig . 4d ; Supplementary ﬁ gure 6 ) . The residence time of an individual Cy5 - Srv2 Δ CARP molecule at the pointed end was determined from this intensity pro ﬁ le over time . Only residence times longer than four frames were counted as true Cy5 - Srv2 Δ CARP binding events ( Fig . 4e ) . Depolymerization rates during periods when Cy5 - Srv2 Δ CARP was present or absent at the pointed end were measured by a linear ﬁ t over measured ﬁ lament lengths as a function of time during the bound or unbound duration ( Fig . 4h ) . The mean time between Srv2 Δ CARP binding events at the ﬁ lament ends was calculated 49 as m ¼ fm 0 (cid:2) 1 (cid:2) f k off ; ð 1 Þ where m ′ is the observed mean time between consecutive Cy5 - Srv2 Δ CARP dwells at the actin ﬁ lament pointed end , f is the fraction of Cy5 - Srv2 Δ CARP molecules with at least one dye as determined in the analysis of Fig . 4b , and k off is the dissociation rate constant of the Cy5 - Srv2 Δ CARP molecule from the ﬁ lament end . The second - order association rate constant for Srv2 Δ CARP binding to the ﬁ lament end was then calculated as k on = 1 / ( mc ) where c was the concentration of Srv2 Δ CARP in the experiment .
