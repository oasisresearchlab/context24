Fay * Departmentof MolecularBiology , Collegeof Agricultureand Natural Resources , Universityof Wyoming , Laramie , WY * davidfay @ uwyo . edu Abstract Molting is an essential process in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans during which the epi - dermal apical extracellular matrix , termed the cuticle , is detached and replaced at each larval stage . The conserved NIMA - related kinases NEKL - 2 / NEK8 / NEK9 and NEKL - 3 / NEK6 / NEK7 , together with their ankyrin repeat partners , MLT - 2 / ANKS6 , MLT - 3 / ANKS3 , and MLT - 4 / INVS , are essential for normal molting . In nekl and mlt mutants , the old larval cuticle fails to be completely shed , leading to entrapment and growth arrest . To better understand the molecu - lar and cellular functions of NEKLs during molting , we isolated genetic suppressors of nekl molting - defective mutants . Using two independent approaches , we identified CDC - 42 , a con - served Rho - family GTPase , and its effector protein kinase , SID - 3 / ACK1 . Notably , CDC42 and ACK1 regulate actin dynamics in mammals , and actin reorganization within the worm epi - dermis has been proposed to be important for the molting process . Inhibition of NEKL – MLT activities led to strong defects in the distribution of actin and failure to form molting - specific apical actin bundles . Importantly , this phenotype was reverted following cdc - 42 or sid - 3 inhibi - tion . In addition , repression of CDC - 42 or SID - 3 also suppressed nekl - associated defects in trafficking , a process that requires actin assembly and disassembly . Expression analyses indicated that components of the NEKL – MLT network colocalize with both actin and CDC - 42 in specific regions of the epidermis . Moreover , NEKL – MLT components were required for the normal subcellular localization of CDC - 42 in the epidermis as well as wild - type levels of CDC - 42 activation . Taken together , our findings indicate that the NEKL – MLT network regulates actin through CDC - 42 and its effector SID - 3 . Interestingly , we also observed that downregula - tion of CDC - 42 in a wild - type background leads to molting defects , suggesting that there is a fine balance between NEKL – MLT and CDC - 42 – SID - 3 activities in the epidermis .

Competinginterests : The authorshave declared that no competinginterestsexist . mutations in the human NEK genes have been implicated in a number of diseases includ - ing cancer and maladies that result from defective cilia . To better understand the biologi - cal functions of NEK kinases , we have undertaken studies in the model system nematode , Caenorhabditis elegans . In this study , we found that NEK kinases regulate the organization of actin , a major component of the cytoskeleton and a player in many cellular processes . In the absence of normal NEK kinase activity , actin fails to form proper filamentous struc - tures during worm development , which leads to growth arrest . Interestingly , these defects in nekl mutants can be partially reversed by simultaneously reducing the activities of CDC42 or ACK1 , two conserved proteins that are key regulators of actin dynamics . Other findings suggest that NEK kinases control actin organization through functional interac - tions with CDC42 and ACK1 . These studies provide a new link between NEK kinases and the actin cytoskeleton and , together with other reports , suggest that these functions may be conserved in humans . Introduction Members of the NIMA - related kinase ( NEK ) family are conserved serine / threonine kinases found in fungi , plants , and animals . The original member of the family , Never in Mitosis A ( NIMA ) , was discovered in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans , where it promotes cell cycle progression [ 1 , 2 ] . More recent analysis has indicated that NIMA interacts with compo - nents of the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport ( ESCRT ) to control normal polarized growth [ 3 ] . Most mammalian genomes encode eleven NEKs , termed NEK1 – NEK11 [ 4 ] , which have a number of distinct functions including roles in cell cycle progression , ciliogen - esis , DNA damage response , and inflammasome activation [ 5 – 14 ] . Correspondingly , a number of NEKs have been implicated in human diseases including cancer , polycystic kidney disease , situs inversus , cardiopathies , paucity of bile duct syndrome , and Majewski syndrome [ 5 , 15 – 24 ] . The genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans encodes four NEK - like proteins , termed NEKL - 1 – NEKL - 4 [ 25 ] . NEKL - 3 is a close ortholog of mammalian NEK6 and NEK7 , whereas NEKL - 2 is most similar to NEK8 and NEK9 [ 25 , 26 ] . We have previously shown that NEKL - 2 and NEKL - 3 , together with three conserved ankyrin repeat partners , MLT - 2 / ANKS6 , MLT - 3 / ANKS3 , and MLT - 4 / INVS , are required for the completion of molting [ 25 – 27 ] . Dur - ing molting , larvae release their old apical extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , termed the cuticle , and synthesize a new one underneath , thereby allowing for further growth and development [ 28 ] . Whereas null mutations in nekls or mlts lead to a complete failure to shed the old cuticle during the first larval molt , hypomorphic alleles typically arrest during the second molt and exhibit a partial release of the old cuticle [ 25 – 27 ] . Our previous studies have suggested that the role of NEKL – MLT proteins in molting may be linked to their regulation of endocytic trafficking , which is critical for the normal molting process [ 25 – 27 ] . Whether the perturbation of normal trafficking is primarily responsible for molting defects in nekl and mlt mutations , however , is currently unresolved . In this study , we further clarify the mechanism through which the NEKL – MLT pathway is involved in molting . More specifically , by using two independent screens , we have linked the NEKL – MLT pathway with the Rho - like GTPase , CDC - 42 / CDC42 , and its conserved effector protein , SID - 3 / ACK1 . CDC42 was initially identified as an essential cell polarity and budding regulator in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its activity is in large part controlled through its association with GTP ( in the active state ) and GDP ( in the inactive state ) [ 29 , 30 ] . Studies in mammals have shown that CDC42 becomes activated in response to different cdc - 42 suppression of NIMA kinases PLOS Genetics | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1007313 April 2 , 2018 2 / 30 intracellular and extracellular signals and , depending on the type of the stimulus , can interact with a wide variety of effectors to control diverse cellular functions . These include actin reorga - nization and polarization , intracellular trafficking , polarized growth , microtubule polarization , and septin organization [ 31 – 41 ] . CDC42 is thus considered to be a key regulator in the estab - lishment and maintenance of cellular polarity , a function that is essential for normal prolifera - tion , differentiation , and morphogenesis [ 34 ] . ACK1 is a non - receptor tyrosine kinase and serine / threonine protein kinase that is implicated in cell morphology , migration , survival , growth , and proliferation [ 42 – 44 ] . More specifically , ACK1 functions in trafficking and cla - thrin - mediated endocytosis through binding to the epidermal growth factor receptor and cla - thrin [ 45 – 47 ] , and also regulates the formation of actin filaments by phosphorylating both the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) and cortactin [ 48 , 49 ] . In addition , ACK1 has been reported to promote the activation state of CDC42 [ 50 ] . In C . elegans , mutations in sid - 3 affect the transfer of dsRNA between cells , suggesting a possible connection to endocytosis and RNA import [ 51 ] . Nevertheless , the functions of SID - 3 are not well characterized in C . ele - gans , and previous studies have not linked SID - 3 functions to CDC - 42 in this species . Our study for the first time functionally connects CDC - 42 / CDC - 42 and SID - 3 / ACK1 with the NIMA - related kinase network . Moreover , we demonstrate that these pathways are critical for the regulation of actin - dependent ECM remodeling and vesicular trafficking in the polar - ized epithelium of C . elegans . Results Inhibition of CDC - 42 suppresses molting defects in nekl - 3 mutants We have previously shown that mutations in components of the NEKL – MLT network lead to a spectrum of molting defects during larval development . In the case of nekl - 3 ( sv3 ) hypo - morphic mutants , larvae typically arrest at the second ( L2 / L3 ) molt and exhibit a stereotypical corset phenotype , whereby the unshed L2 cuticle constricts a significant portion of the central body region [ 25 – 27 ] . To gain insights into the underlying mechanisms controlling molting , as well as targets and components of the NEKL – MLT network , we carried out a screen for RNAi suppressors of nekl - 3 ( sv3 ) molting defects . Among the genes identified , an RNAi clone target - ing cdc - 42 led to penetrant suppression of nekl - 3 ( sv3 ) , such that most treated animals pro - gressed through L3 and L4 stages as compared with control animals that arrested at the L2 / L3 transition ( Fig 1A and 1B ) . We also tested the ability of cdc - 42 ( RNAi ) feeding to suppress defects in nekl - 3 ( gk506 ) null mutants , which arrest during the L1 / L2 molt and exhibit complete encasement within both the L1 and L2 cuticles [ 25 ] . In contrast to the nekl - 3 ( sv3 ) hypo - morphic allele , suppression of nekl - 3 ( gk506 ) by cdc - 42 ( RNAi ) was relatively weak but did lead to an increase in the average width of treated animals ( S1A Fig ) . Repression of CDC - 42 suppresses defects in multiple nekl – mlt mutant backgrounds To test if a reduction in CDC - 42 can suppress loss - of - function phenotypes in other members of the NEKL – MLT network , we examined the effects of cdc - 42 ( RNAi ) feeding on the hypo - morphic alleles of nekl - 2 ( fd91 ) and mlt - 4 ( sv9 ) . In addition , we tested cdc - 42 ( RNAi ) on nekl - 2 ( fd81 ) ; nekl - 3 ( gk894345 ) double mutants . Notably , single mutants of nekl - 2 ( fd81 ) and nekl - 3 ( gk894345 ) are aphenotypic , whereas ~ 99 % of double mutants arrest as larvae with molting defects [ 26 ] . On control RNAi plates , all three strains displayed near uniform L2 / L3 arrest ( Fig 1C – 1E ) , consistent with previous reports [ 25 , 26 ] . RNAi feeding of cdc - 42 led to partial sup - pression of molting defects in all three strains , whereby animals developed through L3 and L4 cdc - 42 suppression of NIMA kinases PLOS Genetics | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1007313 April 2 , 2018 3 / 30 stages and in some cases progressed to adulthood ( Fig 1C – 1E ) . Suppressed adult animals , how - ever , appeared to be sterile , which is likely due to a requirement for cdc - 42 in the germline [ 52 , 53 ] . In addition , we tested for cdc - 42 ( RNAi ) suppression of the nekl - 2 ( gk839 ) null allele , which leads to arrest with a complete encasement phenotype at the L1 / L2 molt [ 25 – 27 ] . Similar to findings for nekl - 3 ( gk506 ) , cdc - 42 ( RNAi ) led to a significant increase in larval width ( S1B Fig ) , although suppression was quite weak . The inability of cdc - 42 ( RNAi ) to robustly suppress null alleles of nekl - 2 and nekl - 3 indicates that reduction of cdc - 42 cannot fully compensate for the complete loss of NEKL activity .

Animals were fed mixtures of bacteria expressing RNAi against either mlt - 2 or mlt - 3 , together with either cdc - 42 or control RNAi . Although suppression under these conditions was weaker than that observed for the hypomorphic alleles described above , cdc - 42 ( RNAi ) led to a significant increase in body width ( S2 Fig ) , which may be due to partial release of the unshed cuticle . Taken together , these results demonstrate that depletion of CDC - 42 can alleviate molting defects in all tested members of the conserved nekl – mlt network . CDC - 42 function is required for molting in C . elegans Given our observation that partial loss of cdc - 42 activity can lead to suppression of molting defects in nekl – mlt mutants , we were interested to determine if perturbation of CDC - 42 levels might have an effect on molting in an otherwise wild - type background . Injection of cdc - 42 dsRNA , which induces a strong reduction in CDC - 42 activity in the germline , leads to severe defects in the early embryonic development of F1 progeny because of disruptions in cell polar - ity and spindle orientation [ 52 , 54 ] . In contrast , cdc - 42 ( gk388 ) null homozygous mutants derived from heterozygous mothers complete embryogenesis but arrest later in development , likely because maternal CDC - 42 provided by the germline is sufficient for progression through early stages of development [ 52 – 55 ] . Interestingly , we found that 32 % ( n = 79 ) of cdc - 42 ( gk388 ) homozygous progeny derived from heterozygous mothers displayed clear molting defects . Most commonly , cuticle detach - ments were observed in the head and tail regions , but in some cases shedding defects were visi - ble in other locations ( Fig 2 ) . Based on P - cell divisions , the majority of cdc - 42 homozygotes arrested at the L3 stage , although 14 % of examined animals progressed to L4 or adult stages ( n = 79 ) . Injection of genomic DNA encoding wild - type cdc - 42 into a balanced cdc - 42 ( gk388 ) strain resulted in normal molting in the F1 generation of transformed larvae ( n > 20 ) , demon - strating that the molting defects in this strain are specifically attributable to a lack of zygotic cdc - 42 expression . Taken together , our findings indicate that whereas weak inhibition of CDC - 42 can partially compensate for a reduction in nekl – mlt activities , CDC - 42 is nevertheless required for normal molting . CDC - 42 is expressed in the epidermis and colocalizes with NEKL – MLT components Because the epidermis is the primary tissue that modulates molting in C . elegans [ 25 – 27 , 56 ] , we next examined the pattern of CDC - 42 expression in the larval epidermis . A functional GFP : : CDC - 42 reporter ( S1 Table ) was expressed in epidermal syncytia ( hyp1 – hyp11 ) as well as in lateral specialized epithelial seam cells ( Fig 3A ) . GFP : : CDC - 42 accumulated in rounded , rod - like , or irregularly shaped structures throughout the cytosol that were enriched in the api - cal region of hyp7 . GFP : : CDC - 42 was also observed in ring - shaped structures , suggesting that CDC - 42 is associated with the membranes of vesicles ( Fig 3A ) . Furthermore , smaller CDC - 42 puncta accumulated at the boundary between the main epidermal syncytium hyp7 and seam cells ( Fig 3A ) . We failed to observe any obvious differences in the pattern of GFP : : CDC - 42 expression in molting versus intermolt animals ( Fig 3B ) , suggesting that CDC - 42 localization may not be grossly altered during the molting program . We did , however , detect a statistically significant increase in mean levels of GFP : : CDC - 42 expression in molting versus intermolt animals , although these changes were relatively modest ( Fig 3C ) . We next asked if CDC - 42 colocalized with components of the NEKL – MLT network that we previously examined using functional CRISRP - generated reporters ( S1 Table ) [ 25 , 26 ] . In cdc - 42 suppression of NIMA kinases PLOS Genetics | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1007313 April 2 , 2018 5 / 30 apical regions of hyp7 , extensive colocalization between MLT - 2 : : mKate2 and GFP : : CDC - 42 puncta was observed in 100 % of animals ( n = 33 ) , primarily at the boundary of seam cells ( Fig 3D and S3A Fig ) , although colocalization was also observed in more medial regions of hyp7 ( Fig 3E and S3B Fig ) . GFP : : CDC - 42 also colocalized with a subset of bright NEKL - 3 : : mKate2 puncta in 8 / 8 animals . Specifically , co - localization was observed in the apical portion of hyp7 in regions non - adjacent to the seam cell . ( Fig 3F and S3C Fig ) . Given that we previously described two independent complexes containing NEKL - 2 – MLT - 2 – MLT - 4 and NEKL - 3 – MLT - 3 [ 26 ] , our results indicate that CDC - 42 partially colocalizes with both complexes during development . The NEKL – MLT network controls CDC - 42 localization in the epidermis Given the observed functional and spatial connections between CDC - 42 and NEKL – MLT components , we next determined if the localization of CDC - 42 is dependent on the NEKL – MLT network . Notably , GFP : : CDC - 42 epidermal localization was altered in 89 % ( n = 53 ) of nekl - 2 ( fd91 ) and 79 % ( n = 53 ) of nekl - 3 ( sv3 ) molting - defective larvae ( Fig 4A – 4C ) . In particu - lar , apical expression of CDC - 42 : : GFP was altered either throughout the entire epidermis or within limited regions . Changes included smearing ( diffuse expression ) of the GFP : : CDC - 42 marker as well as increased aggregation . Although GFP : : CDC - 42 was highly enriched at seam cell boundaries in nekl - 2 ( fd91 ) and nekl - 3 ( sv3 ) mutants , consistent with wild type , seam cells in these mutants were abnormally small and round relative to wild - type controls ( Fig 4A – 4C ) , suggesting a non - autonomous role for NEKL - 2 and NEKL - 3 in seam cell processes .

These findings are consistent with a role for the NEKL – MLT network in directly or indirectly regulating epidermal CDC - 42 subcellular localization . To address the possibility that the observed changes in GFP : : CDC - 42 localization in nekl and mlt mutants were due to indirect effects caused by improper shedding of the cuticle , we examined GFP : : CDC - 42 expression in several unrelated molting - defective backgrounds depleted for FBN - 1 , a fibrillin - like protein ( Fig 4D ) ; MLT - 11 , a putative protease inhibitor ( S4C Fig ) ; or QUA - 1 , a hedgehog - like signaling molecule ( S4D Fig ) . We observed that the pat - tern of GFP : : CDC - 42 localization and seam cell morphology appeared normal in 92 % ( n = 26 ) of fbn - 1 ( tm290 ) mutants , as well as 71 % ( n = 14 ) of mlt - 11 ( RNAi ) , and 100 % ( n = 10 ) of qua - 1 ( RNAi ) worms , indicating a specific role of the NEKL – MLT protein network in the control of CDC - 42 localization .

As a dynamic switch , CDC - 42 cycles between GTP - bound active and GDP - bound inactive forms . To assay CDC - 42 activity , we made use of two independent reporters of CDC - 42 activation . We first examined a GST : : GFP : : WSP - 1 ( GBD ) reporter that associates with GTP - bound active CDC - 42 and is expressed under the control of the cdc - 42 promoter [ 57 ] . In the case of wild type larvae we observed a punctate pattern of expression near the apical surface , which was very similar to our observations for the GFP : : CDC - 42 reporter ( Fig 4E ) . Notably , we observed both qualitative and quantitative differences in patterns of GST : : GFP : : WSP - 1 ( GBD ) in wild - type larvae and nekl - 2 ( fd91 ) and nekl - 3 ( sv3 ) single mutants . GST : : GFP : : WSP - 1 ( GBD ) tended to form aggregations in the mutants ( Fig 4F and 4G ) . In addition , apical expression levels of GST : : GFP : : WSP - 1 ( GBD ) in mutants were nearly twice the levels observed in wild type larvae ( Fig 4H ) , suggesting increased CDC - 42 activity in the mutants . To confirm these results , we used another reporter for CDC - 42 activity , WSP - 1 ( CRIB ) : : mCherry , which is expressed exclusively in the epidermis under the control of the lin - 26 pro - moter [ 58 ] . In wild - type larvae , WSP - 1 ( CRIB ) : : mCherry was primarily observed in small puncta and filament - like structures throughout the epidermis of molting and intermolt ani - mals , with occasional localization within slightly larger aggregates ( S5A Fig ) . The different expression pattern of this reporter in comparison to both GFP reporters for active and total CDC - 42 may be due to difference in the fluorescence tag and its C terminal localization . Although we observed some variability in the pattern of WSP - 1 ( CRIB ) : : mCherry between individual larvae , no consistent differences were detected between molting ( n = 25 ) and inter - molt ( n = 31 ) animals . In contrast , we observed a strong increase in the size ( S5 Fig ) of WSP - 1 ( CRIB ) : : mCherry puncta in 93 % of nekl - 2 ( fd91 ) ( n = 28 ) and 96 % of nekl - 3 ( sv3 ) ( n = 28 ) larvae , as well as an increase in the number of puncta in some animals . This included the formation of very large accumulations that were never observed in wild type ( S5 Fig ) . In contrast to nekl mutants , we observed a wild - type pattern for WSP - 1 ( CRIB ) : : mCherry in 91 % of fbn - 1 ( tm290 ) molting - defective mutants ( n = 21 ) ( S5D Fig ) , and the size of mCherry puncta in fbn - 1 ( 290 ) mutants was much closer to that of wild type ( S5 Fig ) , suggesting that the observed effects on CDC - 42 activity are likely specific to perturbation of the NEKL – MLT network . Collectively , these findings indicate that NEKL – MLT components affect both CDC - 42 subcellular localiza - tion as well as its activity levels . We also tested the effect of expressing two predicted CDC - 42 hyperactive variants ( G12V and Q61L ) [ 54 , 59 – 61 ] in the epidermis using the dpy - 7 promoter , which drives specific expression within epidermal cells [ 62 ] . Whereas expression of wild - type CDC - 42 from trans - genic arrays was well tolerated and gave rise to transmitting lines , both the G12V and Q61L CDC - 42 variants were highly toxic , leading to severe morphological defects and accompanying embryonic and L1 larval lethality in most GFP - marked F1 progeny ( n > 1000 ) . In one represen - tative experiment using cdc - 42 ( G12V ) with the co - injection marker sur - 5 : : GFP , we observed 57 % embryonic lethality and 27 % early L1 lethality ( n = 165 ) of GFP - positive worms whereas cdc - 42 ( Q61L ) led to 55 % embryonic lethality and 22 % L1 lethality ( n = 176 ) . This level of lethality was observed using a range of DNA concentrations and is likely due to the deleterious effects of hyperactive CDC - 42 on the epidermis of embryos undergoing morphogenesis . Approximately 20 % of F1s did not arrest as embryos or L1 larvae but failed to produce stable transmitting lines . F1s that escaped early arrest were typically highly mosaic for expression of the GFP - containing array with a majority displaying some form of morphogenetic defect including molting deficits ( S6 Fig ) . In some cases , we observed complete entrapment within cdc - 42 suppression of NIMA kinases PLOS Genetics | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1007313 April 2 , 2018 9 / 30 the old cuticle at the L2 / L3 stage , whereas other worms failed to shed only a portion of the cuti - cle or became entrapped at later stages ( S6 Fig ) . These findings are consistent with our above data and indicate that epidermal - expressed hyperactive CDC - 42 can cause defects in molting . One caveat to these studies , however , is that the observed effects on molting could be indirectly due to defects in epidermal cells induced by the CDC - 42 gain - of - function mutants earlier in development . Nevertheless , molting phenotypes were observed in some animals that did not display obvious morphological defects ( S6 Fig ) , suggesting that these effects are separable . Mutations in the C . elegans activated Cdc42 - associated kinase 1 ortholog , SID - 3 , suppress molting defects in nekl - 2 and nekl - 3 mutants In a parallel forward genetic screen [ 63 ] , we identified a mutation , fd139 , that strongly suppressed molting defects in nekl - 2 ( fd81 ) ; nekl - 3 ( gk894345 ) double mutants ( Fig 5A and 5B ) . Molecular identification of fd139 revealed it to affect sid - 3 , the ortholog of activated Cdc42 - associated kinase 1 ( ACK1 ) . ACK1 was initially described as a positive regulator of CDC42 activity , although later Fig 5 . Mutations in sid - 3 suppress molting phenotypes of nekl - 2 ; nekl - 3 hypomorphic mutants .

In C . elegans , SID - 3 regulates systemic RNAi and is expressed in the epidermis in a pattern that is similar to what we observed for CDC - 42 [ 51 ] . fd139 is a 5 - bp deletion in sid - 3 exon 13 , leading to a frameshift following Ser 989 of the SID - 3 protein ( B0302 . 1a ) . Using CRISPR / Cas9 methods , we generated five additional alleles of sid - 3 , all of which induced strong suppression of the corset phenotype in nekl - 2 ( fd81 ) ; nekl - 3 ( gk894345 ) animals ( Fig 5A and S2 Table ) . This included two C - terminal ( fd213 and fd214 ) and three N - terminal ( fd218 , fd219 , fd221 ) alleles , of which the latter group caused frameshifts within 60 bp downstream of the start codon . Notably , none of these alleles has any obvious phe - notype on their own , consistent with a previous report [ 51 ] . The ability of the N - terminal sid - 3 alleles to suppress nekl - 2 ( fd81 ) ; nekl - 3 ( gk894345 ) mutants indicates that complete inactivation of SID - 3 can suppress molting defects in the double mutants . These results further strengthen the functional connection between NEKL – MLT components and CDC - 42 and also suggest that SID - 3 cooperates with CDC - 42 in the molting network . The viability of null mutations in sid - 3 , however , indicates that unlike CDC - 42 , SID - 3 is not required for normal molting [ 51 ] . NEKL – MLT components are required for normal actin organization in the epidermis In mammals , CDC42 and Ack1 have important roles in the regulation of the actin cytoskele - ton . Importantly , epidermal actin is reorganized during molts to form circumferentially ori - ented arrays , which have been proposed , though not formally demonstrated , to be critical for molting [ 64 ] . The observation that inhibition of both cdc - 42 and sid - 3 can suppress defects in nekl – mlt mutants further suggested that the NEKL – MLT network may control actin localiza - tion during molting . We first sought to recapitulate the observations of Costa et al . [ 64 ] using phalloidin staining of actin in fixed wild - type worms . We observed that intermolt L2 larvae generally showed very weak actin staining in the epidermis ( Fig 6A ) , suggesting that actin in these animals may be largely diffuse . Occasionally , intermolt animals contained dispersed epidermal actin puncta as well as some accumulation at the seam cell boundary ( Fig 6A ) . In contrast , phalloidin staining in molting animals was much stronger , and actin was clearly organized into parallel apical bundles , consistent with Costa et al . ( Fig 6B ) [ 64 ] . To test if epidermal actin organization is regulated by the NEKL – MLT network , we first examined actin staining in nekl - 2 ( fd91 ) ( n = 29 ) and nekl - 3 ( sv3 ) ( n = 18 ) hypomorphic ani - mals . We failed to observe normal actin bundles in any of the examined animals from both genetic backgrounds . In most larvae , the pattern of actin differed dramatically from wild type in that puncta were more numerous and tended to form aggregations ( Fig 6C and 6D ) . More - over , although mutants occasionally contained short filamentous - like structures , they failed to complete the formation of parallel bundles observed in wild - type molting animals ( S7 Fig ) . In 24 % of nekl - 2 ( fd91 ) and 11 % of nekl - 3 ( sv3 ) mutants we observed some actin filaments or rows of actin puncta in the dorsal and ventral areas of hyp7 , usually above the body wall muscles ( S7B and S7C Fig ) . Notably , patches with actin filaments were more frequently observed in body regions constricted by the old cuticle ; it is possible that actin filaments formed and rap - idly disassembled in the non - constricted regions . In addition , actin accumulations at the hyp7 – seam - cell boundary were frequently undetectable . Consistent with the above findings , actin was mislocalized in 100 % ( n = 38 ) of nekl - 2 ( fd81 ) ; nekl - 3 ( gk894345 ) double mutants , although to a lesser extent than in nekl - 2 ( fd91 ) and nekl - 3 ( sv3 ) single mutants ( Fig 6E ) . Likewise , we observed that formation of filaments was initiated to varying extents in 68 % ( n = 38 ) of nekl - 2 ( fd81 ) ; nekl - 3 ( gk894345 ) mutants ( S7D Fig ) but cdc - 42 suppression of NIMA kinases PLOS Genetics | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1007313 April 2 , 2018 11 / 30 failed to form complete rings . Similar to the single mutants , filaments were prevalent within , but not exclusive to , regions constricted by the cuticle . Large actin aggregates were observed in the posterior regions of nekl - 2 ( fd81 ) ; nekl - 3 ( gk894345 ) larvae , which are typically free of old cuticle . As a control , we also performed phalloidin staining with fbn - 1 ( tm290 ) molting - defec - tive animals and observed a normal molting - specific pattern of actin organization ( n = 8 ) ( Fig 6F ) , indicating that the effects observed for nekl - 2 and nekl - 3 depletion are not likely to be an indirect consequence of improper molting . Collectively , our findings suggest that formation of actin bundles can be initiated but not completed in nekl hypomorphs . Furthermore , filament formation is more severely disrupted in stronger loss - of - function nekl mutants . The strong loss of function allele nekl - 3 ( sv3 ) shows very subtle and rare formation of actin filaments , whereas actin bundle formation was more extensive when two weak loss of function alleles , nekl - 2 ( fd81 ) and nekl - 3 ( gk894345 ) , were com - bined . From these studies we conclude that NEKL - 2 and NEKL - 3 play an important role in actin organization during molting . Depletion of CDC - 42 and SID - 3 reverse actin organization defects in nekl mutants Given that cdc - 42 or sid - 3 depletion can suppress molting defects in nekl - 2 and nekl - 3 mutants , we next determined if epidermal actin organization was restored in suppressed larvae . We observed that cdc - 42 ( RNAi ) had a strong effect on actin organization in both nekl - 2 ( fd91 ) and nekl - 3 ( sv3 ) backgrounds , both by reducing the occurrence of actin accumulations and by pro - moting the formation of actin filaments ( Fig 6G and 6H ) . In the case of nekl - 2 ( fd91 ) ; cdc - 42 Fig 6 . Actin organization in the epidermis is controlled by NEKL and CDC - 42 pathway components . ( A , B ) Apical actin , which is largely diffuse in intermolt larvae ( A ) , reorganizes into a network of parallel bundles during molting ( B ) . The apical actin network is severely perturbed in nekl - 2 ( fd91 ) ( C ) , nekl - 3 ( sv3 ) ( D ) , and nekl - 2 ( fd81 ) ; nekl - 3 ( gk894345 ) ( E ) mutants , unlike in fbn - 1 ( tm290 ) molting - defective control animals ( F ) .

The observed differ - ences between nekl - 2 and nekl - 3 strains may be due to differences in their specific allele strengths or because cdc - 42 ( RNAi ) can more efficiently suppress reduced NEKL - 2 functions . To further analyze effects of CDC - 42 downregulation on actin organization in the apical epidermis , we carried out actin staining on cdc - 42 ( gk388 ) molting defective mutants . Although many of these animals were mostly impermeable to phalloidin , we observed a range of abnor - mal actin patterns . Importantly , in 60 % of mutants ( n = 25 ) actin puncta were organized in parallel rows , reminiscent of molting - specific actin bundles in wild type ( S8C and S8D Fig ) . Nevertheless , filaments connecting these puncta were often missing . Furthermore , the bound - ary with the seam cells in cdc - 42 ( gk388 ) mutants was not always enriched in actin filaments . In the remainder of cdc - 42 ( gk388 ) molting defective animals ( 40 % ) , actin puncta and rare fila - ments showed abnormal actin organization patterns and did not form parallel rows ( S8E and S8F Fig ) . Thus , loss of cdc - 42 activity in an otherwise wild - type background leads to alterations in the normal pattern of actin staining , although this phenotype was generally less severe than that observed in nekl - 2 and nekl - 3 mutants . We also examined actin localization in suppressed and nekl - 2 ( fd81 ) ; nekl - 3 ( gk894345 ) sid - 3 ( fd139 ) animals and observed either a normal molting - specific actin pattern in animals that contained filaments ( n = 6 ) ( Fig 6I ) or a normal punctate intermolt actin pattern ( n = 13 ) . Taken together , our data imply that NEKL - 2 and NEKL - 3 influence the formation of epider - mal apical actin structures during development and that this function is tightly balanced by the activities of CDC - 42 and SID - 3 . Apical actin colocalizes with NEKL – MLT components Because NEKL – MLT components partially colocalize with CDC - 42 and because nekl depletion led to a strong perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton , we next asked whether members of the NEKL – MLT network colocalize with actin . For these studies , we used a strain carrying an inte - grated vab - 10 actin - binding domain ( ABD ) mCherry fusion reporter , which can serve as a proxy for actin expression in live animals [ 65 ] . A CRISPR - generated reporter for NEKL - 2 : : NeonGreen ( S1 Table ) strongly colocalized with the VAB - 10 ( ABD ) : : mCherry reporter in 100 % of worms ( n = 15 ) at subapical regions of the epidermal – seam cell boundary , with little colocalization observed in other regions ( Fig 7A and S9A Fig ) . Likewise , a CRISPR - generated reporter for MLT - 4 ( S1 Table ) , which forms a putative complex with NEKL - 2 [ 26 ] , showed a similar degree of overlap with VAB - 10 ( ABD ) : : mCherry in the same region ( n = 16 ) ( Fig 7B and S9B Fig ) . Lastly , a CRISPR - generated reporter for NEKL - 3 ( S1 Table ) was also found to strongly colocalize with VAB - 10 ( ABD ) : : mCherry in hyp7 in 100 % of examined animals ( n = 11 ) , however , in contrast to NEKL - 2 and MLT - 4 , this overlap occurred throughout the cytoplasm and rarely at the seam cell boundary , where NEKL - 3 is largely absent ( Fig 7C and S9C Fig ) . Collectively , our data place members of the NEKL – MLT complex in close proximity to both actin and CDC - 42 , consistent with a role for NEKL – MLT proteins in regulating the actin cytoskeleton through the CDC - 42 – SID - 3 pathway . Depletion of CDC - 42 and SID - 3 suppress trafficking defects in nekl mutants We previously reported that inhibition of NEKL – MLT components leads to defects in endocy - tosis in the epidermis [ 25 , 26 ] .

To examine effects on trafficking , we used a marker for clathrin , GFP : : CHC - 1 , which localizes to clathrin - coated pits at the apical membrane [ 25 , 26 ] and was also distributed in a punctate pattern throughout the epidermis ( Fig 8A and 8B ) . Consistent with our previous findings , 100 % ( n = 57 ) of nekl - 2 ( fd81 ) ; nekl - 3 ( gk894345 ) double mutants contained abnormal accumulations of the GFP : : CHC - 1 marker . Specifically , nekl - 2 ( fd81 ) ; nekl - 3 ( gk894345 ) mutants exhibited fewer total GFP : : CHC - 1 puncta but these puncta were larger ( Fig 8C and 8D and S10 Fig ) [ 26 ] . In some cases , GFP : : CHC - 1 accumulations were observed to extend from the apical hyp7 surface to more medial regions of the epidermis , whereas other accumulations were exclusively medial ( Fig 8C and 8D ) . cdc - 42 ( RNAi ) was observed to fully restore normal GFP : : CHC - 1 morphology in small percentage ( 15 % ; n = 34 ) of suppressed nekl - 2 ( fd81 ) ; nekl - 3 ( gk894345 ) animals that Fig 8 .

Expression of GFP : : CHC - 1 marker was examined in 24 sagittal planes through the epidermis . Color scale indicates the epidermal position of analyzed puncta in maximal projections of sagittal planes . Yellow line indicates location that was used to generate transverse plane projections from z - stacks of sagittal planes . In the apical sagittal plane illustration , filled white circles indicate apical puncta , whereas unfilled circles with dotted edges represent epidermal puncta that are present only in medial or basal planes . The transverse plane model indicates how selected puncta from the sagittal plane would appear along the apical – basal axis . ( B ) GFP : : CHC - 1 is expressed in small , well - distributed puncta throughout the epidermis in wild - type animals . ( C , D ) The GFP : : CHC - 1 expression pattern is severely altered in nekl - 2 ( fd81 ) ; nekl - 3 ( gk894345 ) double mutants grown on standard NGM ( C ) and control RNAi ( D ) plates , with the formation of large aggregates of the marker . ( E , F ) This phenotype can be partially reversed in cdc - 42 ( RNAi ) – treated animals ( E ) and in nekl - 2 ( fd81 ) ; nekl - 3 ( gk894345 ) ; sid - 3 ( fd139 ) triple mutants ( F ) .

In addition , we observed a slight increase in the number of GFP : : CHC - 1 puncta in nekl - 2 ( fd81 ) ; nekl - 3 ( gk894345 ) animals treated with cdc - 42 ( RNAi ) versus control , although these differences were not statistically significant ( S10 Fig ) . In fact , abnormal clathrin aggregations were prevalent in the epidermis of many cdc - 42 ( RNAi ) animals that were partially or fully suppressed for molting defects ( S11B Fig ) , suggesting that cdc - 42 ( RNAi ) may suppress molting defects through a mechanism that is at least partially independent of traffick - ing as judged by clathrin localization . In contrast , sid - 3 ( fd139 ) , which induces stronger sup - pression of molting defects in nekl - 2 ( fd81 ) ; nekl - 3 ( gk894345 ) mutants than cdc - 42 ( RNAi ) ( compare Fig 1D and Fig 5B ) , led to restoration of normal GFP : : CHC - 1 expression in 82 % of animals ( n = 39 ) ( Fig 8F and S10 Fig ) . Very rarely , some aggregates could be observed in nekl - 2 ( fd81 ) ; nekl - 3 ( gk894345 ) ; sid - 3 ( fd139 ) triple mutants , although they were typically smaller than in non - suppressed double mutants ( S11C Fig ) . In summary , our results indicate that inhi - bition of CDC - 42 and its partner SID - 3 can suppress molting phenotypes in mutants of the nekl – mlt network and can at least partially correct associated defects in actin patterning and trafficking . Discussion We have shown that inhibition of the small Rho GTPase CDC - 42 leads to the suppression of molting defects in nekl – mlt hypomorphic backgrounds . Likewise , we independently found that mutations in sid - 3 , the C . elegans ortholog of activated Cdc42 - associated kinase 1 , also suppress nekl mutants , indicating that CDC - 42 – SID - 3 functions are closely connected to NEKL – MLT signaling in the epidermis . Furthermore , we have observed that cdc - 42 downre - gulation in wild type can lead to molting defects and developmental arrest , suggesting that there is a functional balance between NEKL – MLT and CDC - 42 activities in the epidermis . This balance becomes particularly important during molting , when inhibition of either com - ponent impairs normal ECM remodeling . Moreover , our observation that inhibition of CDC - 42 and SID - 3 can suppress molting defects in nekl – mlt mutants indicates that NEKL kinases are most likely negative regulators of CDC - 42 – SID - 3 . This control could be at the level of CDC - 42 – SID - 3 intrinsic activity , through effects on subcellular localization , or both . Consistent with a strong functional link , we observed that CDC - 42 partially colocalizes with components of both NEKL – MLT complexes , NEKL - 2 – MLT - 2 – MLT - 4 and NEKL - 3 – MLT - 3 . Furthermore , normal GFP : : CDC - 42 localization and activity depend on NEKL - 2 and NEKL - 3 , suggesting that there is both a spatial and functional interaction between CDC - 42 and the NEKL – MLT protein network . Interestingly , independent proteomic studies to identify binding partners of mammalian NEK6 and NEK7 both identified CDC42 [ 68 , 69 ] . These find - ings suggest that CDC42 interacts directly or indirectly with NEK6 and NEK7 , the highly con - served mammalian orthologs of NEKL - 3 . Furthermore , a CDC42 modifier , Rho - GAP SNX26 ( ARHGAP33 ) , which is implicated in regulation of vesicular trafficking , has also been identi - fied as interacting with NEK6 [ 68 ] . Because the phosphorylation targets of NEK kinases are largely unknown , we hypothesize that CDC42 , its regulators , or its effectors could be con - trolled by NEK phosphorylation ( Fig 9 ) . This is consistent with findings that the phosphoryla - tion status of CDC42 and its GEFs is important for their localization and activity [ 70 – 72 ] . CDC42 has important functions in the establishment of cell polarity , cytoskeletal reorgani - zation and the regulation of endocytosis [ 34 , 59 , 73 , 74 ] . In this study we analyzed the effects of nekl – mlt depletion on two CDC - 42 - dependent processes , actin remodeling and endocytosis , which are known to be important for molting in C . elegans [ 27 , 64 , 75 ] . It has been previously proposed that apical actin bundles reorganize at each molt to facilitate proper ECM formation [ 64 ] . In support of this model , we have shown that loss of NEKL - 2 and NEKL - 3 activity leads cdc - 42 suppression of NIMA kinases PLOS Genetics | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1007313 April 2 , 2018 16 / 30 cdc - 42 suppression of NIMA kinases PLOS Genetics | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1007313 April 2 , 2018 17 / 30 to defects in the pattern of apical actin , a failure to form molting - specific arrays of actin bun - dles , and defective molting ( Fig 9 ) . These apical actin bundles are proposed to contract as new cuticle is synthesized between the actin filaments , thus allowing for the formation of a new cuticle that is larger than the previous one [ 64 ] . Our finding that NEKL - 2 and NEKL - 3 deple - tion strongly perturb apical actin organization suggests a mechanism by which both detach - ment of the old cuticle and new cuticle synthesis might be impaired in nekl – mlt mutants . Namely , disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton may alter the distribution and timing of new cuticle synthesis and create an abnormal juxtaposition of the old and new cuticles , resulting in a failure to fully separate . Our observation that nekl mutants often contain incompletely formed molting - type actin bundles within constricted body regions supports this idea . In addi - tion , colocalization data from this study indicate that components of the NEKL – MLT network and actin are partially coexpressed in the same subcellular compartments , which , together with CDC - 42 colocalization data , further support a model for the specific control of actin orga - nization by NEKL kinases through CDC - 42 . Consistent with this model , inhibition of CDC - 42 and SID - 3 can suppress actin localization defects in nekl mutants , suggesting that NEKL – MLT components are required to spatially and / or temporally repress CDC - 42 – SID - 3 activity in the epidermis . Interestingly , studies in mammalian cells have implicated MLT - 4 / INVS in apical actin reg - ulation as INVS knockout mouse fibroblasts form excessive actin - rich filopodia during inter - phase as well as in mitosis [ 76 ] . Notably , filopodia formation is CDC42 dependent , and filopodia overproduction by mammalian cells is a characteristic of mutations that lead to higher CDC42 activity [ 77 , 78 ] . Moreover , CDC42 activity increases in mammalian cells fol - lowing depletion of INVS , consistent with INVS acting as a negative regulator of CDC42 [ 79 ] . Our study suggests that this function for MLT - 4 / INVS may be conserved in C . elegans and demonstrates for the first time that other components of the NEKL – MLT network control CDC42 activity and actin organization . Both CDC42 and the actin cytoskeleton have been previously implicated in multiple aspects of vesicular trafficking . For example , actin may control the spatial organization of endocytic machinery components , promote the formation of membrane invaginations , create forces required for vesicle fission and internalization , and provide a barrier function that negatively regulates the rate of endocytosis [ 80 – 82 ] . Actin is essential for clathrin - mediated endocytosis in yeast , although its role in mammalian endocytosis may be more limited . Interestingly , actin is required for mammalian endocytosis at cell surfaces that are enriched for actin filaments [ 81 ] . Notably , such cortical enhancement of actin filaments is found at the apical surface of epidermal syncytium in C . elegans [ 64 ] , providing a potential connection between actin and the regulation of vesicular trafficking during molting . Importantly , endocytosis is a critical process for ECM remodeling in C . elegans , and inacti - vation of core endocytic components , including CHC - 1 , leads to molting defects [ 25 – 27 , 75 , 83 – 86 ] . One possible role of endocytosis in ECM remodeling may be in resorption and recy - cling of old cuticle components [ 27 ] . Furthermore , epidermal endocytosis has been implicated in the process of sterol uptake from the surrounding environment , and sterols have a proposed role in the synthesis of hormonal cues that initiate molting in nematodes [ 27 , 56 ] . In addition , endocytosis is closely coupled to exocytosis [ 87 ] , a process critical for cuticle synthesis [ 27 ] . Namely , the rate of exocytosis must be balanced with a commensurate level of endocytosis to Fig 9 . Summary model of observed results . NEKL - 2 and NEKL - 3 downregulation leads to aberrant actin and clathrin expression patterns in the epidermis , which can be partially suppressed by cdc - 42 ( RNAi ) or completely restored to the wild - type expression pattern by inactivating SID - 3 .

Previously , we have shown that the NEKL – MLT protein network regulates endocytosis in the epidermis [ 25 , 26 ] . In this study , we found that highly penetrant trafficking defects in nekl - 2 ( fd81 ) ; nekl - 3 ( gk894345 ) double mutants can be partially or completely suppressed by CDC - 42 and SID - 3 downregulation . Nevertheless , we observed that suppression of molting defects was not always well correlated with the restoration of normal clathrin localization patterns . This could be due to different threshold requirements for the suppression of molting defects versus the normalization of clathrin - mediated endocytosis . For example , a partial correction of vesicular trafficking may be sufficient to prevent overt molting defects . Alternatively , impaired endocytosis may not be a primary cause of molting defects in nekl – mlt mutants , con - sistent with our earlier finding that trafficking alterations are not detected in all molting - defec - tive animals depleted for components of the NEKL – MLT network [ 25 , 26 ] . Instead , the observed endocytosis defects could be a secondary consequence of actin disorganization in nekl – mlt mutants , given that apical actin assembly and disassembly are critical for normal endocytosis [ 81 , 82 , 88 – 93 ] . In addition , it is possible that perturbation of both endocytosis and apical actin organization contribute to the observed molting defects in nekl – mlt mutants and that suppression can be achieved through compensatory effects on either process . In summary , our data implicate the C . elegans orthologs of NIMA - related kinases NEK6 , NEK7 , NEK8 , and NEK9 , along with their conserved ankyrin - repeat binding partners , in the regulation of actin remodeling and intracellular trafficking through functional interactions with CDC42 and its effector ACK1 . We propose that , by modulating CDC42 – ACK1 activity , NEK kinases may control a wide variety of cellular processes including effects on actin mor - phology and endocytosis ( our study ) , along with potential downstream effects on cell cycle – related processes and ciliogenesis .

RNA interference RNAi was performed using bacterial strains from Geneservice using standard protocols [ 95 ] . In the study that identified cdc - 42 , we screened all available clones on LGII ( ~ 3000 clones ) for clones that allowed nekl - 3 ( sv3 ) mutants to bypass L2 / L3 arrest . Control RNAi experiments were carried out using the bacterial strain HT115 carrying either a vector plasmid ( pPD129 . 36 ) or gfp ( RNAi ) . Marker localization studies involving mlt - 3 ( RNAi ) were carried out using strains that were previously grown for several generations on lin - 35 ( RNAi ) plates , which increases RNAi sensitivity [ 96 ] . Combined RNAi treatments in S2 Fig were performed using RNAi - hypersensi - tive rrf - 3 ( pk1426 ) mutants . Bacteria expressing mlt - 2 , mlt - 3 , cdc - 42 , and gfp ( RNAi ) constructs were grown to the same density and combined at specific ratios . A bacterial culture expressing mlt - 2 ( RNAi ) was combined at a 2 : 1 ratio with bacteria expressing cdc - 42 ( RNAi ) or gfp ( RNAi ) , whereas the mlt - 3 ( RNAi ) bacterial strain was mixed with the above RNAi clones at a 1 : 2 ratio . CDC - 42 gain - of - function mutants Plasmids were generated by amplifying the dpy - 7 promoter region from plasmid pCFJ1662 ( gift of Barth Grant ) using the primers 5’ - tcgacaaagctttctcattccacgatttctc - 3’ and 5’ - tcgacactg - cagttatctggaacaaaatgtaagaa - 3’ . Following digestion with HindIII and PstI , PCR product was inserted into pD95 . 75 to create plasmids pDF400 . Genomic cdc - 42 coding sequences was amplified from fosmids WRM069cE02 and WRM0610aC01 using primers 5’ - tgattcggatccatgca - gacgatcaagtgcgtc - 3’ and 5’ - tgattcggtacctcgttccaattcacccactca - 3’ , digested with BamHI and KpnI , and ligated into PDF400 to produce pDF406 . G12V and Q61L cdc - 42 mutants were gen - erated using the Q - 5 Site - Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( New England Biolabs ) and the following primers : For G12V primers 5’ - gttggagatgtagctgtcggtaaaac - 3’ and 5’ - gacgacgcacttgatcgt - 3’ ; for Q61L primers 5’ - actgctggactggaagattac - 3’ and 5’ - atcaaacaatcctaatgtgtatg - 3’ . G12V ( pDF409 ) and Q61L ( pDF412 ) Plasmids were sequence confirmed and injected with sur - 5 : : GFP ( pTG96 ) into 20 – 25 N2 worms at the following concentrations : 50 ng / μl sur - 5 : : GFP + 100 ng / μl cdc - 42 , 100 ng / μl sur - 5 : : GFP + 50 ng / μl cdc - 42 , 100 ng / μl sur - 5 : : GFP + 20 ng / μl cdc - 42 , 100 ng / μl sur - 5 : : GFP + 15 ng / μl cdc - 42 . Each injected worm was transferred to a new plate every 24 hours and its progeny were scored and imaged . Genetic identification and analysis of sid - 3 sid - 3 ( fd139 ) was identified as described in Joseph et al . [ 63 ] . CRISPR / Cas9 technology was used to generate additional loss - of - function alleles of sid - 3 in the nekl - 2 ( fd81 ) ; nekl - 3 ( gk894 345 ) background . Specifically , genome engineering was performed using CRISPR / Cas9 ribo - nucleoproteins in combination with the dpy - 10 co - CRISPR method [ 97 – 99 ] . crRNAs were cdc - 42 suppression of NIMA kinases PLOS Genetics | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1007313 April 2 , 2018 20 / 30 designed to target sequences in the N terminus ( 5’ - AGTGCTCCGCAAAG CACAGT - 3’ ) or C terminus ( 5’ - TGAGCCGATTCTCTCGTCTG - 3’ ) of sid - 3 . Absence of re - pair templates allowed for non - homologous repair mechanisms to generate random frame - shifts and premature stop codons in the desired regions . Six loss - of - function alleles were isolated , including fd213 , a 16 - bp insertion and one point mutation in exon 13 , causing a frameshift after L987 and premature stop at amino acid position 1034 ; fd214 , a 7 - bp deletion in exon 13 , causing a frameshift after L987 and premature stop at amino acid position 1006 ; fd218 , a 5 - bp deletion in exon 1 , causing a frameshift after K19 and premature stop at amino acid position 25 ; fd219 , a 1 - bp deletion in exon 1 , causing a frameshift after A20 and premature stop at amino acid position 101 ; and fd221 , a 31 - bp insertion and 1 - bp deletion in exon 1 , caus - ing a frameshift after A20 and premature stop at amino acid position 24 ( also see S2 Table ) . Suppressed nekl mutants were analyzed at the last molt ( Fig 6 ) or as L4 or adult worms ( Figs 5 and 8 ) . Actin staining Actin staining was performed following a modified procedure from Costa et al . [ 64 ] . Animals were washed in M9 solution , and fixation was carried out by incubating animals in fixative ( 2 % paraformaldehyde in 0 . 05 M Na 3 PO 4 , pH 7 . 4 ) for 2 h at room temperature . Worms were washed three times in PBS and stored at 4˚C . Phalloidin - TRITC ( 0 . 1 mg / ml , dissolved in methanol ) was diluted in permeabilization solution ( 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 1 M NaCl , 3 . 7 % sucrose ) at a ratio of 1 : 500 . Equal amounts of liquid containing fixed animals and the phalloi - din - containing solution were mixed and incubated in a dark chamber for at least 1 h . To avoid possible post mortem artifacts in our analyses , we scored only the animals that did not show any alterations in the morphology of their internal organs . Microscopy Fluorescent images were acquired using an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope with a spin - ning - disc confocal head ( CSUX1 Yokogawa ) . Confocal illumination was provided by an ILE - 4 laser launch ( SpectralAppliedResearch ) . MetaMorph7 . 7 software was used for image acquisi - tion . DIC images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse epifluorescence microscope and Open Lab software . This setup was also used for measuring body length and width . Body width was measured in the central region of animals ; 50 animals were scored for each category . Animals were immobilized using a 0 . 1 M solution of levamisole . Distinguishing molting larvae from intermolt larvae was achieved using 0 . 5 - μm red beads mixed with food ( Sigma L3280 ) , follow - ing the protocol of Nika et al . [ 100 ] . For Fig 6 , wild - type molting and intermolt animals were categorized using a mlt - 10p : : gfp - pest reporter [ 101 , 102 ] . Fluorescence intensity of GFP : : CDC - 42 in Fig 3 was measured using the FIJI program . For each animal , average fluorescence intensity was measured in 10 equal , randomly selected regions of hyp7 and average values were determined . GFP : : CDC - 42 was analyzed in 27 molt - ing and 30 intermolt wild - type animals . Fluorescence intensity of GST - GFP : : WSP - 1 ( GBD ) in Fig 4 was measured using ImageJ program . Mean intensities in selected areas were calculated for 11 animals or more and averaged . Background mean intensities were subtracted . Average area of puncta in S5 Fig and number of puncta in S10 Fig were calculated using FIJI program , using ten animals for each genetic background . Colocalization analyses were performed on L4 - stage larvae to allow for better visualization of fluorescent structures . Line scanes in S3 and S9 Figs were made using Metamorph . Colocalization with VAB - 10 ( ABD ) : : mCherry marker was performed in apical regions of epidermis that are slightly more medial than the plane con - taining actin bundles , as this region showed the greatest extent of colocalization .
