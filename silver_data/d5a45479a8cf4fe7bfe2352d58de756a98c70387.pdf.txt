PRL - induced pathways are mediated by two non - receptor tyrosine kinases , JAK2 and Src . We previously demonstrated that prolactin stimulates invasion of breast cancer cells TMX2 - 28 through JAK2 and its target serine / threonine kinase PAK1 . We hypothesize herein that the actin - binding protein cortactin , a protein involved in invadopodia formation and cell invasion , is activated by PRL . We demonstrate that TMX2 - 28 cells are more invasive than T47D breast cancer cells in response to PRL . We determine that cortactin is tyrosyl phosphorylated in response to PRL in a time and dose - dependent manner in TMX2 - 28 cells , but not in T47D cells . Furthermore , we show that PRL mediates cortactin tyrosyl phosphorylation via Src , but not JAK2 . Finally , we demonstrate that maximal PRL - mediated TMX2 - 28 cell invasion re - quires both Src and JAK2 kinase activity , while T47D cell invasion is JAK2 - but not Src - dependent . Thus PRL may induce cell invasion via two pathways : through a JAK2 / PAK1 mediated pathway that we have previously demonstrated , and Src - dependent activation and tyrosyl phosphorylation of cortactin . © 2015 Elsevier Inc .

Prolactin ( PRL ) , the hormone which regulates lactation and mam - mary gland development , is also implicated in promoting breast cancer cell proliferation , survival , motility and angiogenesis , and the prolactin receptor ( PRL - R ) is expressed in nearly 98 % of human breast cancers ( reviewed in Ref . [ 1 ] ) . Importantly , PRL mediates breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis . Administration of PRL in animal models increases metastasis , while loss of the PRL - R pre - vents the progression of neoplasia into invasive carcinoma [ 2 , 3 ] . Overexpression of degradation - resistant PRL - R in MCF10A cells increases cell proliferation and invasion , while PRL - R knockdown in T47D cells signi ﬁ cantly reduces cell invasion and matrix - degrading matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) - 9 expression [ 4 ] . Additionally , PRL , along with IGF - 1 , increases MMP - 2 expression and cell inva - sion in a MAPK - dependent manner [ 5 ] . We have previously pro - vided evidence of a novel PRL - mediated pathway during cell invasion . We demonstrated that PRL increases MMPs secretion and invasion of TMX2 - 28 cells , a highly invasive variant of the MCF - 7 breast cancer cell line , in a JAK2 / p21 - activated kinase ( PAK1 ) - dependent manner [ 6 , 7 ] . Cell migration is an important step in metastasis and PRL acts as a chemoattractant to breast cancer cells , promoting their motility [ 8 , 9 ] . Cell migration relies on actin cyto - skeletal reorganization mediated by small Rho - GTPases Rac1 and CDC42 . PRL activates Rac1 through Tec tyrosine kinase / Vav1 and serine / threonine kinase Nek3 [ 9 e 13 ] . Additionally , PRL activates CDC42 [ 11 ] . We have demonstrated two novel mechanisms that regulate PRL - mediated breast cancer cell motility ; ( 1 ) through PAK1 and ﬁ lamin A and ( 2 ) through regulation of adhesion turnover [ 14 , 15 ] . Prolactin - mediated pathways are regulated by non - receptor tyrosine kinases ( nRTKs ) , as the PRL - R has no intrinsic kinase ac - tivity . In response to PRL , receptors dimerize and activate down - stream nRTKs . One nRTK activated by PRL is JAK2 , a protein that participates in cell cycle progression , apoptosis , genetic instability and histone modi ﬁ cation ( reviewed in Ref . [ 16 ] ) . PRL - R dimeriza - tion leads to activation and autophosphorylation of JAK2 at tyro - sines 1007 / 1008 [ 17 e 19 ] . JAK2 activation stimulates several important signaling cascades , including signal transducers and activators of transcription , mitogen activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) , and phosphoinositol - 3 kinase pathways ( reviewed in Ref . [ 1 ] ) . PRL - mediated JAK2 activation is implicated in breast cancer progression , as eliminating JAK2 activity suppresses PRL - mediated tumorigenesis [ 20 ] . In addition to JAK2 , PRL can also Abbreviations : PRL , prolactin ; JAK2 , Janus kinase 2 ; PRL - R , prolactin receptor ; nRTKs , non - receptor tyrosine kinases ; MMP , matrix metalloproteinase . * Corresponding author .

Src activation in response to PRL has also been implicated in breast cancer invasion . In the presence of a stiff collagen matrix , PRL sig - nals through Src / FAK to promote secretion of MMP - 2 and works synergistically with estrogen to promote breast cancer cell prolif - eration [ 23 , 24 ] . As PRL promotes breast cancer cell invasion and modulation of the actin cytoskeleton , we decided to study the actin - binding protein cortactin as a possible target of PRL signaling in breast cancer cells . Cortactin is localized to the cortical actin cytoskeleton where it mediates actin nucleation , endocytosis , and actin poly - merization during cell motility and adhesion ( reviewed in Ref . [ 25 ] ) . Notably , the cortactin gene CTTN lies on chromosome locus 11q13 , which is often ampli ﬁ ed in metastatic breast cancers , and cortactin overexpression has been implicated in tumor aggressiveness and poor prognoses in breast cancer ( [ 26 ] , reviewed in Ref . [ 25 ] ) . Furthermore , tyrosyl phosphorylation of cortactin is required for its full activation , and increased levels of tyrosyl phosphorylated cortactin correspond with increased cell motility and invasion ( reviewed in Refs . [ 25 , 27 e 30 ] ) . Cortactin can be tyrosyl phosphorylated by several kinases , including the Src family kinases , Fer kinase and c - Met [ 31 e 33 ] . Interestingly , ablation of cortactin phosphorylation by stable expression of phospho - tyrosine - de ﬁ cient mutant cortactin in highly invasive MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells reduces metastasis in nude mice [ 34 ] . Furthermore , depletion of cortactin in breast cancer cells over - expressing active Src diminishes invadopodia formation [ 35 ] . In this study we provide evidence that cortactin is a novel target in PRL signaling and demonstrate that PRL promotes tyrosyl phosphorylation of cortactin in highly invasive TMX2 - 28 breast cancer cells , but not in less invasive T47D cells . Our data suggest that tyrosyl phosphorylation of cortactin in response to PRL is mediated through Src but not JAK2 tyrosine kinase . Finally , both JAK2 and Src activity are required for PRL - mediated TMX2 - 28 cell invasion , thus , introducing a novel PRL - dependent mechanism that regulates breast cancer cell invasion . 2 . Material and methods 2 . 1 . Antibodies Monoclonal a phospho - tyrosine ( a PY ; clone 4G10 ; EMD Milli - pore ) , monoclonal a JAK2 ( Invitrogen ) , polyclonal a PY416 Src Family Kinases ( Cell Signaling ) , and polyclonal a PY1007 / 1008 JAK2 ( Invi - trogen ) were used for immunoblotting . Monoclonal a cortactin ( clone 4F11 ; Millipore ) and polyclonal a Src ( Cell Signaling ) were used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting . JAK2 was immunoprecipitated using a JAK2 antiserum provided by Dr . Carter - Su ( The University of Michigan ) . Prolactin was purchased from Dr . Parlow ( National Hormone and Peptide Program , NIDDK ) . 2 . 2 . Cell cultures T47D and TMX2 - 28 ( sub - line of MCF - 7 cells [ 6 ] ) cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium or DMEM ( Corning Inc ) , respectively , with all supplements . Deprivation media for T47D and TMX2 - 28 cells consisted of RPMI 1640 or DMEM , respectively , supplemented with 1 % bovine serum albumin ( Sigma e Aldrich ) . 2 . 3 . Cell invasion assay Equal numbers of T47D and TMX2 - 28 cells ( 5 (cid:1) 10 5 ) were placed in deprivation media with or without inhibitors ( 0 . 1 m M PP1 , 50 m M AG490 ) in the upper chamber of a Boyden chamber ( Corning Inc . ) coated with Matrigel ( BD Biosciences ) . Deprivation media with or without 500 ng / ml PRL was placed in the lower chamber . After 48 h , cells from ﬁ ve separate ﬁ elds that had invaded the Matrigel were counted after ﬁ xation with 4 % formalin ( Sigma ) and staining with Differential Quik Stain ( Polysciences , Inc ) . 2 . 4 . Immunoprecipitation Cells were deprived of serum for 72 h before treatment with or without PRL . Proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell ly - sates using the indicated antibodies and protein A - agarose . Proteins were resolved by SDS - PAGE followed by immunoblotting . Fold phosphorylation of cortactin was determined by densitometric analysis of a PY bands normalized to a cortactin bands using Image J software . 2 . 5 . Assessing Src and JAK2 kinase inhibition To assess inhibition by PP1 , endogenous Src and JAK2 were immunoprecipitated with a Src or a JAK2 from cells deprived from serum for 72 h and treated with PP1 ( Calbiochem , 0 . 1 m M , 2 h ) and PRL ( 200 ng / ml , 20 min ) and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay in the presence of 10 m Ci of [ g - 32 P ] ATP ( MP Biomedicals ) . Relative levels of incorporated 32 P into Src and JAK2 were assessed by autoradiography and estimated by a phosphoimager . The same membrane was blotted with a Src and a JAK2 antibodies . To assess inhibition by AG490 , deprived cells were treated with 0 , 25 , 50 , 100 , and 125 m M AG490 ( Calbiochem ) overnight . Before harvesting , cells were treated with PRL ( 200 ng / mL ) for 20 min . Proteins were resolved using SDS - PAGE and immunoblotted using a pY1007 / 1008 JAK2 antibody to determine JAK2 autophosphor - ylation and a PY416 Src Family Kinase antibody to determine Src autophosphorylation . The same membrane was probed with a JAK2 and a Src antibodies . 2 . 6 . Statistical analysis Data from at least 3 separate experiments were pooled and analyzed using 1 - way ANOVA plus Tukey ' s honest signi ﬁ cant dif - ference test . Differences were considered to be statistically signif - icant at P < 0 . 05 . Results are expressed as the mean ± SE . 3 . Results and discussion 3 . 1 . TMX2 - 28 cells are more invasive than T47D cells We have previously demonstrated that PRL stimulates the in - vasion of TMX2 - 28 cells via a JAK2 / PAK1 pathway [ 7 ] . In an attempt to identify additional mechanisms that regulate PRL - dependent cell invasion , we decided to compare the invasiveness of TMX2 - 28 and the poorly invasive T47D breast cancer cells . 100 ng / ml of PRL did not stimulate invasion in neither T47D nor TMX2 - 28 cells after 48 h ( data not shown ) . However , treatment of both cell lines with a higher concentration of PRL ( 500 ng / ml ) for 48 h led to greater invasion of TMX2 - 28 cells than T47D cells through Matrigel ( Fig . 1 , black bars ) . Basal invasion in serum - free medium without treat - ment was also attenuated in T47D cells as compared to TMX2 - 28 cells ( Fig . 1 , white bars ) . Thus , PRL stimulates invasion in both T47D and TMX2 - 28 cells and to a greater extent in TMX2 - 28 cells . 3 . 2 . Prolactin stimulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of cortactin in TMX2 - 28 but not T47D cells To de ﬁ ne a mechanism that regulates cell invasion differently in TMX2 - 28 and T47D cells , we focused on cortactin since it plays a signi ﬁ cant role in invasion [ 35 e 37 ] . Since tyrosyl phosphorylation A . Hammer et al . / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 463 ( 2015 ) 644 e 649 645 of cortactin is important for cortactin activation [ 25 ] , we tested whether PRL causes tyrosyl phosphorylation of cortactin . We treated T47D cells with PRL over a time - course and analyzed the immunoprecipitated endogenous cortactin for tyrosyl phosphory - lation . Tyrosyl phosphorylation of endogenous cortactin over basal levels in response to PRL was not observed in T47D cells ( Fig . 2A ) . On the contrary , when TMX2 - 28 cells were treated with PRL over the same time course , maximal tyrosyl phosphorylation of cortac - tin appeared at 20 min of PRL treatment and was transient ( Fig . 2B ) . Furthermore , we treated TMX2 - 28 cells with increasing concen - trations of PRL and showed that a minimum of 200 ng / ml of PRL was required for cortactin tyrosyl phosphorylation ( Fig . 2C ) . Increasing PRL concentration above 200 ng / ml did not further in - crease cortactin phosphorylation . Tyrosyl phosphorylation of cor - tactin upon PRL stimulation observed in TMX2 - 28 cells which was lacking in T47D cells may explain why TMX2 - 28 cells are more invasive than T47D cells . Bowden et al demonstrated that cortactin colocalizes with phospho - tyrosine in complexes termed “ invado - podia complexes ” [ 38 ] . Increasing the amount of phospho - tyrosine at these cortactin - rich invadopodia increased proteolytic activity in these areas , suggesting that increased tyrosyl phosphorylation of cortactin in invadopodia contributes to cell invasion . Importantly , PRL does not stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of cortactin in T47D in our study . T47D cells are not known to form invadopodia and basal level T47D invasion is potentiated only after cortactin over - expression [ 35 , 39 ] . It is also important to note that the lack of cortactin phosphorylation in T47D was not due to low levels of expressed endogenous cortactin protein , as the amount of immu - noprecipitated cortactin in T47D cells was comparable to TMX2 - 28 cells ( Fig . 2A e C , a cortactin blots ) . To determine the mechanism in which PRL induces cortactin phosphorylation , we focused on the two major nRTKs activated in response to PRL . 3 . 3 . Src kinase , but not JAK2 kinase , tyrosyl phosphorylates cortactin in response to PRL PRL signaling is mediated by two main non - receptor tyrosine kinases ; Src and JAK2 . In order to determine which pathway Fig . 1 . TMX2 - 28 cells are more invasive thanT47D cells . T47D and TMX2 - 28 cells were serum deprived and equal amounts of cells were loaded into the upper part of the Boyden chamber coated with Matrigel . The number of cells that migrated to the lower part of the chamber towards PRL ( 500 ng / ml ) ( black bar ) or buffer control ( white bar ) after 48 h were counted in 5 randomly chosen ﬁ elds and plotted . Bars represent mean ± SE . * P < 0 . 05 for three independent experiments . Fig . 2 . Cortactin is tyrosyl phosphorylated inTMX2 - 28 cells , but not T47D cells , in response to PRL . A - B ) Endogenous cortactinwas immunoprecipitated from T47D ( A ) or TMX2 - 28 ( B ) cell lysates after PRL ( 150 ng / ml ) treatment for the indicated time points and probed for tyrosyl phosphorylation with a phospho - tyrosine antibody ( a pY ) . C ) Endogenous cortactin was immunoprecipitated from TMX2 - 28 cell lysates after 20 min of PRL treatment at the indicated concentrations and probed for tyrosyl phosphorylation with a pY . All graphs ( A e C ) represent the densitometric analysis of the band obtained for phosphorylated cortactin normalized to total cortactin for each lane of at least 3 independent ex - periments .

Hammer et al . / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 463 ( 2015 ) 644 e 649 646 mediates cortactin tyrosyl phosphorylation , we utilized two se - lective inhibitors , PP1 [ 40 ] and AG490 [ 41 ] , to inhibit either Src or JAK2 respectively . To assess the effectiveness of PP1 on Src kinase inhibition , TMX2 - 28 cells were treated with PP1 before treatment with PRL . Endogenous Src was immunoprecipitated and the kinase activity of Src was analyzed in an in vitro kinase assay . Src kinase activity was reduced in cells pre - treated with PP1 when compared to those without inhibitor ( Fig . 3A ) . To con ﬁ rm that PP1 treatment would not also reduce the kinase activity of JAK2 , TMX2 - 28 cells were pre - treated with PP1 , and JAK2 was immunoprecipitated after PRL treatment . JAK2 kinase activity in response to PRL was unaf - fected by PP1 , as demonstrated by a JAK2 in vitro kinase assay ( Fig . 3A ) . This is consistent with previously published data indi - cating that PP1 does not inhibit JAK2 - dependent PRL - R phosphor - ylation and activation of the JAK2 / STAT5 pathway in W53 cells and JAK2 autophosphorylation is unaffected by PP1 in T47D cells [ 42 , 43 ] . Next , we assessed the inhibition of JAK2 kinase activity by AG490 . TMX2 - 28 cells were pre - treated with increasing concen - trations of AG490 followed by treatment with PRL . Cell lysates were blotted using a phospho - JAK2 - speci ﬁ c antibody that recognizes pY1007 / 1008 , the sites of JAK2 autophosphorylation . We showed that AG490 inhibited JAK2 autophosphorylation in a dose depen - dent manner and a minimum of 50 m M of AG490 was needed to ef ﬁ ciently inhibit JAK2 autophosphorylation ( Fig . 3B ) . To test the effect of AG490 on Src kinase activity , we probed the same mem - branes with a PY416 - Src antibody and demonstrated that Src kinase activity in response to PRL was not reduced with AG490 treatment ( Fig . 3B ) . These data are in agreement with previously published data demonstrating that PRL stimulates Src activation in mammary epithelial cells isolated from mid - pregnant JAK2 - null mice and suggests that JAK2 activity is not necessary for PRL - mediated Src activation [ 44 ] . To determine which kinase is responsible for PRL - mediated cortactin tyrosyl phosphorylation , TMX2 - 28 cells were pre - treated with PP1 , AG490 , or both inhibitors in combination before treatment with PRL . The cortactin immunoprecipitates were assessed for tyrosyl phosphorylation . PRL induced cortactin phos - phorylation ( Fig . 3C , lanes 1 and 2 ) , however , pre - treatment with the Src inhibitor PP1 completely abolished tyrosyl phosphorylation of cortactin ( Fig . 3C , lane 3 ) . Conversely , treatment with the JAK2 inhibitor AG490 had no effect on cortactin tyrosyl phosphorylation ( Fig . 3C , lane 4 ) . The addition of AG490 to PP1 treatment had no signi ﬁ cant impact on PP1 ' s ability to inhibit PRL - mediated cortactin tyrosyl phosphorylation ( Fig . 3C , lane 5 ) . These data suggest that PRL induces tyrosyl phosphorylation of cortactin through Src , and not JAK2 . In support , it has been previously demonstrated that reducing Src kinase activity by expressing kinase - inactive Src into MDA - MB - 231 cells reduced phospho - tyrosine signal in cortactin - rich invadopodia [ 38 ] . Additionally , cortactin was discovered as a target of oncogenic v - Src in transformed chicken ﬁ broblasts and expression of active forms of pp60 - Src leads to tyrosyl phosphor - ylation of cortactin [ 31 ] . 3 . 4 . Both JAK2 and Src kinase activities are required for maximal PRL - mediated TMX2 - 28 cell invasion To study whether both JAK2 - and Src - dependent pathways regulate PRL - induced cell invasion , we assessed invasion of TMX2 - 28 and T47D cells in the presence of JAK2 and Src inhibitors , AG490 and PP1 respectively . Treatment with one of inhibitors without PRL did not reduce basal cell invasion of either T47D or TMX2 - 28 cells ( Fig . 4 , white bars ) . Src inhibition signi ﬁ cantly attenuated PRL - induced invasion of TMX2 - 28 but not T47D cells while JAK2 inhi - bition signi ﬁ cantly reduced PRL - mediated invasion of both TMX2 - 28 and T47D cells ( Fig . 4 , black bars ) . The combination of PP1 and AG490 further reduced both PRL - mediated ( black bar ) and basal ( white bar ) invasion of TMX2 - 28 , but not T47D cells , suggesting that both JAK2 and Src kinases are required for TMX2 - 28 cell in - vasion . It is important to note that Src inhibition did not signi ﬁ - cantly reduce T47D cell invasion and the combination of both Src and JAK2 inhibitors did not further attenuate either basal or PRL - induced T47D cell invasion . This data suggest that the more Fig . 3 . Src kinase , but not JAK2 kinase , tyrosyl phosphorylates cortactin in response to PRL . A ) PP1 inhibits Src , but not JAK2 . TMX2 - 28 cells were treated with PP1 ( 0 . 1 m M , 2 h ) before treatment with PRL ( 200 ng / ml , 20 min ) . Endogenous Src or JAK2 was immunoprecipitated and subjected to an in vitro kinase ( IVK ) assay and probed with a Src or a JAK2 . B ) AG490 inhibits JAK2 , but not Src . TMX2 - 28 cells were treated with indicated concentrations of AG490 overnight then with PRL ( 200 ng / ml , 20 min ) . Whole cell lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies . a pY - JAK2 antibody recognizes pY1007 / 1008 on JAK2 and a pY - Src antibody recognizes pY416 on Src family kinases . C ) Src tyrosyl phosphorylates cortactin in response to PRL . TMX2 - 28 cells were treated with indicated inhibitors before treatment with PRL . Endogenous cortactin was immunoprecipitated from TMX2 - 28 cells and probed for tyrosyl phosphorylation with a pY . Each ﬁ gure represents the same blot reblotted with indicated antibodies . All blots are representative of at least 3 experiments . A . Hammer et al . / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 463 ( 2015 ) 644 e 649 647 invasive TMX2 - 28 cells utilize two PRL - dependent pathways , JAK2 - and Src - dependent , to promote cell invasion while in less invasive T47D cells only JAK2 pathway is implicated in invasion in response to PRL . It may explain why TMX2 - 28 cells are more invasive than T47D cells . Here we propose a novel PRL - mediated pathway during breast cancer cell invasion . PRL promotes cell invasion to a greater extent in TMX2 - 28 cells when compared to less invasive T47D cells . This increase in cell invasion in TMX2 - 28 cells may depend on the tyrosyl phosphorylation of cortactin which does not occur in T47D cells upon PRL stimulation . Through this study , we provide evi - dence that PRL - mediated tyrosyl phosphorylation of cortactin is through the nRTK Src , and not through the nRTK JAK2 . Inhibition of either JAK2 or Src reduces PRL - mediated TMX2 - 28 cell invasion , while only inhibition of JAK2 reduces T47D cell invasion . Thus , PRL can stimulate breast cancer cell invasion via two different path - ways : ( 1 ) through JAK2 / PAK1 and secretion of MMPs which we have previously demonstrated and ( 2 ) through Src / cortactin , a novel PRL - mediated pathway .

Both JAK2 and Src kinase activity are required for maximal PRL - mediated TMX2 - 28 cell invasion . T47D and TMX2 - 28 cells were serum deprived and equal amounts of cells were loaded into the upper part of the Boyden chamber coated with Matrigel with or without PP1 ( 0 . 1 m M ) , AG490 ( 50 m M ) , or both inhibitors together . The number of cells that migrated to the lower part of the chamber towards PRL ( 500 ng / ml ) ( black bar ) or buffer control ( white bar ) after 48 h were counted in 5 randomly chosen ﬁ elds and plotted . Bars represent mean ± SE . * P < 0 . 05 for three independent experiments . A . Hammer et al . / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 463 ( 2015 ) 644 e 649 648 [ 31 ] E .
