Rac is required for constitutive macropinocytosis by dendritic cells but does not control its downregulation Michele A . West * , Alan R . Prescott * , Eeva - Liisa Eskelinen * , Anne J . Ridley † and Colin Watts * Background : Dendritic cells use constitutive macropinocytosis to capture exogenous antigens for presentation on MHC molecules . Upon exposure to inflammatory stimuli or bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , macropinocytosis is dramatically downregulated as part of a developmental programme leading to dendritic cell maturation , migration and activation of T cells . It is not known , however , how macropinocytosis is sustained in dendritic cells in the absence of exogenous stimuli , nor how it is downregulated upon maturation . We have tested the possibility that one or more members of the Rho family of GTPases are involved in and control pinocytosis in dendritic cells . Results : We established dendritic cell populations that show constitutive macropinocytosis that was downregulated by LPS treatment . Microinjection of immature cells with dominant - negative Rac ( N17Rac1 ) or treatment with Clostridium difficile toxin B , the phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3 - K ) inhibitor wortmannin , or LPS all inhibited the formation of macropinosomes but , surprisingly , did not eliminate membrane ruffling . Microinjection of N17Cdc42 or the Rho inhibitor C3 transferase eliminated actin plaques / podosomes and actin cables , respectively , but had little effect on the formation of macropinosomes . Surprisingly , dendritic cells matured with LPS had equivalent or even somewhat higher levels of active Rac than immature cells . Moreover , microinjection of a constitutively active form of Rac ( V12Rac1 ) into mature dendritic cells did not reactivate macropinocytosis . Conclusions : Rac has an important role in the constitutive formation of macropinosomes in dendritic cells but may be required downstream of membrane ruffling . Furthermore , regulation of Rac activity does not appear to be the control point in the physiological downregulation of dendritic cell pinocytosis . Instead , one or more downstream effectors may be modulated to allow Rac to continue to regulate other cellular functions . Background Dendritic cells have a crucial role in the immune response , being unique in their ability to effectively trigger a primary T - cell response to foreign antigen [ 1 ] . Dendritic cells exist in distinct developmental states , which allows them to fulfil their roles in antigen capture and presentation . Immature bone - marrow - derived den - dritic cells seed the peripheral tissues , sampling and pro - cessing the antigens they encounter . In response to local inflammatory stimuli or infectious agents , dendritic cells undergo a maturation process during which they migrate to secondary lymphoid organs where they present previ - ously captured antigenic material to naive T cells . In vitro recapitulation of these events has revealed that dendritic cells upregulate the expression of MHC molecules , adhe - sion molecules and co - stimulatory molecules and down - regulate their endocytotic capacity as part of this developmental programme [ 1 – 4 ] . Macropinocytosis has emerged as a key antigen uptake pathway by which dendritic cells can rapidly and non - specifically sample large amounts of surrounding fluid [ 5 – 7 ] . Exogenous antigen taken up by this route can be processed and presented to T cells on both MHC class I and class II molecules [ 6 , 7 ] . Macropinosomes are large ( ~ 0 . 2 – 5 . 0 m m diameter ) endocytic structures which form when membrane ruffles fuse together , non - selectively engulfing fluid - phase material [ 8 ] . Particularly striking in dendritic cells is the fact that membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis are constitu - tive [ 6 , 7 ] , whereas in fibroblasts , epithelial cells and most other cell types studied , these events require stimulation by growth factors [ 9 – 12 ] . Moreover , in cultured human mono - cyte - derived dendritic cells at least , macropinocytosis is downregulated by inflammatory stimuli [ 6 ] . The Rho - family GTPases Rac , Rho and Cdc42 are major regulators of the actin cytoskeleton .

Parallel roles for Rho in regulating the assembly of focal adhesions and stress fibres and for Cdc42 in the formation of peripheral filopodia have also been identified [ 14 – 16 ] . Subsequently , many other studies have confirmed a role for Rac in stimulating ruffling and lamellipodium exten - sion in a variety of different cell types , including lympho - cytes , macrophages , mast cells and neurons . Rac has also been implicated in the regulation of related cellular processes such as adhesion , cell spreading , migration , axonal extension and phagocytosis [ 15 , 17 – 23 ] . Rac is also known to be a regulatory component of NADPH oxidase in phagocytes and a component of signal transduction pathways linking growth factors to the regulation of gene expression and cell proliferation [ 24 – 26 ] . We have investigated two key issues relating to the regu - lation of macropinocytosis in dendritic cells : first , how immature dendritic cells maintain such high levels of constitutive macropinocytosis , and second , how this activity is downregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli . Specifically , we have investigated the role of Rho - family GTPases in these events . We find a clear requirement for Rac for constitutive macropinocytosis in dendritic cells , but , interestingly , ruffling and formation of macropinosomes appear to be separately regulated . Developmental downregulation of macropinocytosis in this system is not accompanied by a measurable decrease in levels of active Rac , suggesting that one or more downstream elements of the pathway are developmen - tally regulated . Results Spleen - derived murine dendritic cells exhibit high levels of macropinocytosis which can be downregulated by LPS To investigate the regulation of macropinocytosis in den - dritic cells , we have adopted a system for culturing primary spleen - derived dendritic cells ( SDCs ) in the short to medium term [ 27 ] . Murine splenocytes are isolated and cultured in the presence of granulocyte – macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM – CSF ) , a cytokine essential for dendritic cell growth , and transforming growth factor - b ( TGF - b ) , which has been shown to support the outgrowth of immature , Langerhans - type dendritic cells [ 28 – 30 ] . After approximately 14 days , the cultures are highly enriched for dendritic cells compared with the starting population , as judged by FACS analysis of expression of markers for B cells , T cells and dendritic cells . The den - dritic cell integrin CD11c was almost undetectable in the starting population , but was expressed on the majority of cells cultured in GM – CSF and TGF - b . B and T cells , which were abundant in the starting population , were absent from the final SDC population ( see Supplementary material ) . A large proportion of cells in the starting popula - tion ( presumably B cells ) also expressed high levels of MHC class II molecules , which were much reduced on 840 Current Biology Vol 10 No 14 Figure 1 Current Biology ( a ) ( b ) SDCs SDCs serum starved B cells ( A20 ) T cells ( EL4 ) – LPS + LPS Selective downregulation of constitutive macropinocytosis in LPS - treated spleen dendritic cells ( SDCs ) . ( a ) Immature SDCs after 14 days culture ( first panels ) , SDCs that had been starved of growth factors and serum for 3 h ( second panels ) , and the B and T cell lines A20 and EL4 ( third and fourth panels , respectively ) were incubated with 1 . 5 mg / ml FITC – dextran for 20 min at 37°C . In the fluorescence micrographs ( top panels ) , macropinosomes are visible as large fluorescently labelled vacuoles in SDCs , but not in B or T cells . Corresponding differential interference contrast ( DIC ) images are shown in the bottom panels . ( b ) LPS - treated ( + LPS ) and untreated ( – LPS ) SDCs ( mSDCs and iSDCs , respectively ) were analysed for macropinocytosis as in ( a ) . No FITC – dextran - labelled macropinosomes were detectable in mSDCs after 10 min . The scale bars represent 10 m m . immature SDCs . SDCs also expressed DEC - 205 and other markers associated with immature dendritic cells . To compare the endocytic capacity of SDCs with that of other cell types , we followed the uptake of the fluid - phase marker FITC – dextran . Within minutes , SDCs formed many large ( > 300 nm diameter ) FITC - labelled macropinosomes ( Figure 1a ) . Remarkably , removal of GM – CSF , TGF - b and serum for 3 hours did not abolish macropinocytosis ( Figure 1a ) , confirming that this process is constitutive in immature murine SDCs , as it is in human monocyte - derived dendritic cells [ 6 ] . In contrast , B and T lymphocytes showed no evidence of FITC uptake into macropinocytic structures over this time scale , although smaller labelled structures , probably rep - resenting conventional endocytic vesicles , were just detectable ( Figure 1a ) . Immature dendritic cells can be induced to differentiate into mature dendritic cells by treatment in vitro with a variety of inflammatory stimuli or infectious agents , includ - ing bacterial products such as LPS [ 31 – 34 ] . To test whether we could drive the maturation of SDCs , we pre - treated the cells for 40 hours with LPS and then assessed their capacity for macropinocytosis . Uptake of FITC – dextran into macropinosomes was dramatically reduced compared with untreated cells demonstrating that our culture system gen - erates dendritic cells that display an authentic LPS - regu - lated pinocytic response ( Figure 1b ) . We refer to the LPS - treated and untreated cells as mature SDCs ( mSDCs ) and immature SDCs ( iSDCs ) , respectively . In parallel , we also quantitated the number of clathrin - coated pits and vesicles as markers of the conventional micropinocytic pathway . Whereas iSDCs had 6 . 0 – 1 . 15 coated pits per 100 m m cell surface , on mSDCs this was reduced , but only to a small extent ( 5 . 0 – 0 . 79 pits per 100 m m cell surface ) . Thus there is a selective downregulation of macropinocyto - sis on SDC maturation . Dominant - negative Rac specifically inhibits macropinocytosis in immature SDCs To test the possible role of Rho - family GTPases in the maintenance of constitutive macropinocytosis in SDCs , we first exposed the iSDCs to Clostridium difficile toxin B , which has been shown specifically to glucosylate Rac , Rho and Cdc42 and inhibit their function [ 35 ] . Macropinocyto - sis in iSDCs was strongly inhibited under these conditions ( only 14 % of treated cells had labelled pinosomes com - pared with 92 % of untreated cells ) , indicating that one or more members of this GTPase family are required to maintain constitutive macropinocytosis . To test the requirement for Rac , Cdc42 and Rho individually we microinjected N17Rac1 , N17Cdc42 or C . botulinum C3 transferase to block endogenous Rac , Cdc42 and Rho function , respectively [ 13 ] . We also established a rigorous new test to ensure that only viable cells were analysed after microinjection . The naturally fluorescent protein allophycocyanin ( APC ) was conjugated to a nuclear localisation signal peptide ( NLS ) and co - injected into the cytosol . APC – NLS translocates into and accumulates in the nucleus in an energy - dependent manner , provid - ing not just a marker for identifying injected cells , but also an indicator of cell viability following microinjec - tion . Only cells with clearly fluorescent nuclei were con - sidered in these experiments . After microinjection , the cells were incubated at 37°C for 20 minutes and then exposed to FITC – dextran for 10 minutes to label newly forming macropinosomes . Cells injected with APC – NLS alone , or with APC – NLS and the inactive mutant A35Rac1 [ 13 ] as controls , exhib - ited large FITC - labelled pinosomes , also seen in neigh - bouring non - injected cells ( Figure 2a , top and middle panels ) . Cells injected with N17Rac1 , however , failed to macropinocytose FITC – dextran ( Figure 2a , bottom panel ) . Microinjected cells were scored positive in this assay if they formed one or more FITC - labelled macropinosomes in 10 minutes . Quantitation from four independent exper - iments , scoring a total of 450 N17Rac1 - injected cells , con - firmed that N17Rac1 completely inhibited macropinocytosis in immature SDCs ( Figure 2b ) . The Rac - related GTPases Rho and Cdc42 also regulate actin cytoskeleton rearrange - ments and Rac , Rho and Cdc42 have all been implicated in phagocytosis , another actin - dependent endocytic pathway [ 22 , 23 , 36 ] . We tested the specific Rho inhibitor C3 transferase and a dominant - negative mutant of Cdc42 , N17Cdc42 , for their effects on macropinocytosis in iSDCs . As shown in Figure 2c , both inhibitors caused a small reduction in the percentage of injected cells showing labelled macropinosomes . The effects were mod - erate compared with the more dramatic inhibition of macropinocytosis observed with N17Rac1 ( Figure 2b ) , and may be indirectly due to changes in cell morphology . Both C3 transferase and N17Cdc42 induced clear - cut effects on other actin - based cytoskeletal structures in SDCs , however . Microinjection with N17Cdc42 reduced or abolished clusters of distinct actin plaques observed in SDCs whereas microinjection of recombinant C3 trans - ferase specifically eliminated actin cables . Neither of these inhibitors affected the presence of membrane ruffles . Quan - titation of these effects of C3 transferase and N17Cdc42 is shown in Figure 2d ; representative images used for this analysis can be seen in Supplementary material . Persistence of membrane ruffles in the absence of macropinosome formation Because active Rac is required for growth - factor - stimu - lated membrane ruffling in a number of cell types and for constitutive macropinocytosis in SDCs , it seemed likely that N17Rac1 inhibited macropinocytosis in iSDCs by inhibiting the formation of membrane ruffles , which are the precursors of macropinosomes . To test this , we Research Paper Macropinocytosis in dendritic cells West et al . 841 performed double - labelling experiments in which phal - loidin - labelled actin structures and macropinosomes con - taining FITC – dextran could be observed in the same injected cells . Surprisingly , although N17Rac1 - injected iSDCs were essentially devoid of macropinosomes , they still displayed actin - rich membrane ruffles ( Figure 3a ) . Control experiments clearly showed that the same prepa - ration of N17Rac1 , when injected into quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts , effectively blocked ruffling in response to phorbol ester stimulation ( data not shown ) . As an alter - native means of inhibiting Rac function , we treated iSDCs with toxin B for 30 minutes and then assessed the same cells for the presence of ruffles and labelled macropinosomes . Membrane ruffles were still strikingly evident on cells treated with toxin B , although the mor - phology of the ruffles was somewhat different ( Figure 3a ) . Nonetheless , macropinosome formation was completely abolished ( Figure 3a ) . Thus , constitutive ruf - fling in iSDCs appears to be much less dependent on Rac function than in other cell types , in which exogenous stimuli are used to induce it . PI3 - K has been implicated in growth - factor - stimulated ruffling and fluid - phase pinocytosis [ 37 – 40 ] . When we tested the effects of the PI3 - K inhibitor wortmannin on ruffling and macropinocytosis in SDCs , we made essen - tially the same observation : macropinocytosis was virtu - ally eliminated , whereas phalloidin - stained membrane ruffles could still be seen in the same treated cells ( Figure 3a ) . Finally , membrane ruffles or veils were still abundant , or indeed more pronounced , under conditions where macropinocytosis was inhibited by LPS - driven SDC maturation ( Figure 3a ) . The effects of N17Rac1 , toxin B , wortmannin and LPS on the presence of mem - brane ruffles and labelled macropinosomes were quanti - tated in the same cells . The results clearly show that while all four treatments inhibited macropinocytosis , membrane ruffles persisted , indicating the existence of 842 Current Biology Vol 10 No 14 Figure 2 Rac is specifically required for constitutive macropinocytosis in SDCs . ( a ) iSDCs were microinjected with APC – NLS alone ( top ) , or with APC – NLS and A35Rac1 ( middle ) or N17Rac1 ( bottom ) , then exposed to FITC – dextran for 10 min at 37°C .

Levels of active Rac , Cdc42 and Vav in iSDCs versus mSDCs Because active Rac is required for constitutive macropinocytosis in iSDCs , a potential mechanism for the downregulation of pinocytosis in mature cells would be through a reduction in levels of Rac protein or Rac – GTP . To test this hypothesis , we used a fusion protein compris - ing a p21 - activated kinase ( PAK ) CRIB domain fused to glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) , which specifically binds Rac – GTP and Cdc42 – GTP but not the inactive GDP - bound forms , to directly measure levels of active Rac in lysates from LPS - treated and untreated SDCs [ 41 – 43 ] . As shown in Figure 4a , when Rac present in SDC lysates was loaded with GDP or the poorly hydrolysable GTP ana - logue GTP g S , the GST – PAK fusion protein selectively precipitated GTP - bound rather than GDP - bound Rac . We then prepared lysates from iSDCs and mSDCs and performed Rac affinity precipitations using the GST – PAK fusion protein . Rac could clearly be precipitated from iSDC lysates with GST – PAK , whereas in a control precip - itation with GST alone , no Rac was detected by western blotting ( Figure 4a ) . When we carried out a precipitation from mSDC , however , rather than showing a reduced amount of active Rac , LPS - matured SDCs had two - to threefold higher levels of PAK - precipitable Rac ( Figure 4a ) . Total Rac levels in the lysates from iSDCs and mSDCs were essentially unchanged ( Figure 4a , lower panel ) . The overall consensus from seven experiments , each of which showed efficient LPS - driven downregula - tion of macropinocytosis , was that Rac activity either increased or remained essentially the same . This striking result indicates that whereas Rac activity is clearly required for constitutive macropinocytosis , this does not appear to be the control point for the developmental regu - lation of macropinocytosis . A similar analysis was per - formed for Cdc42 , which also interacts with the PAK CRIB domain [ 44 ] . As shown in Figure 4b , there was also a detectable and reproducible small increase in the amount of precipitable Cdc42 in LPS - matured cells . We also assessed two other potential indicators of Rac activity , membrane association of Rac and levels of the guanine - nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) Vav . We frac - tionated LPS - treated and untreated SDCs into mem - brane / cytoskeleton and cytosolic pools , and quantitated the levels of Rac in each by western blotting . A small percentage of total Rac was recovered in the mem - brane / cytoskeleton fraction in iSDCs , but could be increased fivefold by incubating the lysates in the pres - ence of GTP g S ( Figure 4c ) . Levels of membrane - associ - ated Rac in samples from LPS - treated SDCs were virtually unchanged , however , ( 11 % of total after subtrac - tion of background due to cytosol contamination ) com - pared with untreated samples ( 12 % ) , supporting the previous observation that Rac – GTP levels were not reduced in LPS - matured cells ( Figure 4a ) . Vav is expressed in haematopoietic cells [ 45 ] and is known to stimulate nucleotide exchange on Rac [ 46 ] . Vav activity is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation by the Src - family kinase Lck , and can be regulated both directly and indi - rectly by products of PI3 - K [ 47 ] . We compared levels of total and tyrosine - phoshorylated Vav immunoprecipitated Research Paper Macropinocytosis in dendritic cells West et al . 843 Figure 3 Membrane ruffles persist in the absence of macropinosome formation in SDCs . iSDCs were microinjected with APC – NLS alone or with APC – NLS together with N17Rac1 , or were treated with toxin B or wortmannin , or induced to mature with LPS .

( b ) For each condition , the percentage of cells that displayed actin - rich ruffles was determined ( white bars ) , and among those cells , the percentage also containing any labelled macropinosomes was assessed ( black portions of the bars ) .

Thus , neither the activity of Rac , nor its membrane localisation , nor the level of the active form of at least one GEF for Rac are downregulated upon den - dritic cell maturation , in spite of the fact that Rac - depen - dent macropinocytosis is completely shut down . Constitutively active Rac does not overcome the downregulation of macropinocytosis in mature SDCs To strengthen our conclusion that downregulation of pinocytosis in mature SDCs is not controlled by downreg - ulation of Rac activity , we microinjected a constitutively active mutant of Rac ( V12Rac1 ) into LPS - treated SDCs . V12Rac1 stimulates ruffling and macropinocytosis in fibroblasts [ 13 ] . After a short incubation period , we exposed the injected cells to FITC – dextran to assay macropinosome formation . As shown in Figure 5 , there was no significant increase in macropinosome formation in V12Rac1 - injected mature cells compared with neighbour - ing uninjected cells , and levels of macropinocytosis remained far below those in untreated iSDCs . The prepa - ration of V12Rac1 was fully active , as judged by its ability to induce membrane ruffles in 85 % of quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts . V12Cdc42 was also unable to restimulate macropinocytosis in mature SDCs ( data not shown ) . Thus downregulation of constitutive macropinocytosis does not appear to be induced by decreased Rac activity in imma - ture SDCs , nor could it be reactivated in mature SDCs by manipulation of the levels of active Rac . Discussion Although the significance of macropinocytosis in many cell types is not obvious , it has considerable physiological relevance in dendritic cells , enabling the non - specific sampling of proteins in the external milieu and display of processed peptides on MHC molecules . Furthermore , this feature of the immune - stimulatory arsenal of dendritic cells is subject to unusual regulation , being constitutive in immature cells and downregulated upon cell maturation . This makes biological sense , distinguishing a phase of antigen capture in peripheral tissues from a phase of antigen presentation after dendritic cell migration to lym - phoid tissue [ 1 ] . The persistence of MHC – peptide com - plexes formed in immature cells is likely to be aided by low rates of endocytosis and membrane turnover [ 6 ] . To study this regulation we have used a method of cultur - ing murine SDCs using GM – CSF and TGF - b [ 27 ] . This system has several key features for our purpose . First , populations of immature dendritic cells are obtained , of which ~ 90 % show very active macropinocytosis . Second , using LPS , we can simulate physiological maturation and effectively downregulate macropinocytosis in virtually all cells . Third , the use of ex vivo murine cells allows the use of gene - targeted mice to probe dendritic cell function . For 844 Current Biology Vol 10 No 14 Figure 4 Levels of active Rac and Cdc42 are maintained on LPS - driven maturation of SDC . ( a ) To determine Rac , iSDCs ( – LPS ) or mSDCs ( + LPS ) were lysed ( 10 7 cells / sample ) and affinity precipitated with GST – PAK ( PAK ) or control GST ( upper blot ) . Bound proteins were probed on western blots with an anti - Rac antibody . Control lysates were loaded with GDP or GTP g S before GST – PAK precipitation . The lower blot shows the analysis of 3 % of a lysate for levels of total Rac protein . ( b ) Determination of Cdc42 . Experiments were carried out as for ( a ) , except that 1 . 7 · 10 7 cells were lysed for each sample and western blots were probed with an anti - Cdc42 antibody . ( c ) Lysates of iSDCs ( – LPS ) or mSDCs ( + LPS ) were incubated with or without GTP g S , and then fractionated into fractions enriched in membrane and cytosol , respectively . Levels of Rac were assessed by western blotting following electrophoresis of 100 % of the membrane fraction and 30 % of the cytosol fraction . Quantitation by densitometry indicated that 17 % and 20 % of total recovered Rac was associated with membrane fractions of iSDC and mSDC , respectively . Parallel analysis of a cytosolic marker ( AMP - activated kinase ) indicated 5 % and 9 % contamination of the respective membrane fractions by cytosol ( data not shown ) . ( d ) Vav protein in lysates of iSDC ( – LPS ) or mSDC ( + LPS ) was immunoprecipitated with anti - Vav or control antibody ( iSDC only , rightmost lanes ) and the western blots probed with specific antibodies for total Vav protein or for tyrosine - phosphorylated Vav ( P - Tyr ) .

Membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis are constitutive in SDCs , continuing for several hours after GM – CSF , TGF - b and serum have been removed . This raised the question of whether Rho - family GTPases would regulate these activities , as they do exogenously stimulated mem - brane ruffling and macropinocytosis in other cells . System - atic testing of dominant - negative mutants or inhibitors of Rac , Cdc42 and Rho established that there is a require - ment for Rac function in constitutive macropinocytosis in dendritic cells . Dominant - negative mutants of Rho - family GTPases are believed to function by sequestering GEFs , and therefore preventing the activation of endogenous GTPases [ 48 ] . As some GEFs can activate more than one Rho family member , at least in vitro , the possibility that an inhibitory GTPase may actually block activation of other related GTPases should be considered . In our system , however , we find that inhibitors of Rac , Rho and Cdc42 produce distinct effects on the actin cytoskeleton and macropinocytosis in dendritic cells , suggesting that N17Rac1 does not inhibit macropinocytosis by inhibiting activation of Rho or Cdc42 . N17Cdc42 was a much less effective inhibitor of macropinosome formation than N17Rac1 , in spite of being able to substantially reduce actin plaques ; similarly , C3 transferase , an independent inhibitor of Rho , only slightly reduced macropinocytosis while specifically and completely abolishing actin cables . Because membrane ruffling is clearly a prerequisite for macropinocytosis , and Rac is strongly implicated in regu - lating ruffling , an unexpected finding was that although N17Rac1 abolished macropinocytosis in SDCs it did not eliminate membrane ruffles . Indeed , ruffles also persisted on iSDCs treated with toxin B and wortmannin and on LPS - matured mSDCs , all of which had downregulated macropinocytotic activity ( Figure 3 ) . There are various possible explanations . First , there might be different types of ruffles that are differentially dependent on Rac function and differ in their ability to contribute to macropinosome formation . Membrane ruffles and lamel - lipodia , generally defined as cell - surface protrusions con - taining a meshwork of newly polymerised actin filaments , can take on a variety of appearances depending on cell type and conditions [ 49 ] , and there is evidence that not all ruffles are structurally identical ; for example , some ruffles on chick embryo fibroblasts are distinguishable from others by their dependence on microtubules [ 50 ] . An alternative possibility might be that in SDCs , Rac is required for the conversion or closure of membrane ruffles to form macropinosomes , rather than being required for ruffling per se . In fact , the idea of regulation of macropinocytosis at a point downstream of ruffling has already been proposed for macrophages , where , as we also find for SDCs , the PI3 - K inhibitor wortmannin appeared to block a late step in macropinosome formation , and not ruffling as such [ 51 ] . Finally , our data do not exclude the possibility that downstream targets of Rac involved in con - stitutive ruffling in other cell types are constitutively acti - vated in SDCs , or could be activated by alternative mechanisms , perhaps involving members of the Rho family other than Rac , Cdc42 and Rho . Although ruffling appeared to be independent of Rac in SDCs , our data nonetheless indicate that Rac is a key reg - ulator of macropinocytosis in immature SDCs , leading us to speculate that macropinosome formation might be downregulated in mature cells through a reduction in Rac levels or activity . We found , however , that Rac – GTP levels were unchanged , or actually increased , in mature dendritic cells compared to immature cells . Furthermore , the introduction of constitutively active Rac could not restore macropinocytosis in mature SDCs . These data suggest that macropinocytosis is downregulated , at least in cultured SDCs , by some other mechanism . One possibil - ity is that one or more effectors of Rac , or elements of the actin cytoskeleton required for pinosome formation , are Research Paper Macropinocytosis in dendritic cells West et al . 845 Figure 5 The constitutively active Rac mutant V12Rac1 does not rescue macropinocytosis in LPS - matured dendritic cells . iSDCs ( – LPS ) or mSDCs ( + LPS ) were microinjected with APC – NLS with or without V12Rac1 protein . The cells were exposed to FITC – dextran for 10 min and viable injected cells and neighbouring non - injected cells were scored for the presence of any labelled macropinosomes ( 77 V12Rac1 - injected cells were scored ) . Note the failure of V12Rac1 to induce macropinocytosis in LPS - treated cells over the background levels seen in surrounding non - injected cells .

Alternatively , the signalling pathway may be modified in mature cells at the level of upstream regula - tors of Rac , for example by expression of different GEFs , which could affect the specificity of downstream events without greatly changing net levels of active Rac [ 52 ] . Garrett and colleagues have recently completed a similar analysis of developmental regulation of endocytosis in murine dendritic cells derived from bone marrow rather than spleen ( I . Mellman , personal communication ) . In this system , regulation of endocytosis appears to be controlled by the levels of active Cdc42 . Indeed , macropinocytosis in mature cells could be rescued by microinjection of active Cdc42 . The reasons for the differences in these two studies are not yet clear ; it is , however , important to note that both the source of dendritic cell precursors and the culture conditions were different . Our spleen cultures were usually 14 – 28 - day cells cultured with GM – CSF and TGF - b whereas the bone - marrow cultures were shorter term and did not include TGF - b . TGF - b is known to be required for outgrowth of Langerhans - type dendritic cells , for example , from CD34 + precursors [ 29 , 30 , 53 ] , although we do not know how closely our cells resemble Langer - hans cells . Conceivably , the spleen and bone - marrow den - dritic cell populations may differentially express Rho GTPases and / or effectors , which could account for the dif - ferences in regulation . Taken together , these data indicate that dendritic cells might use different strategies to regu - late endocytosis in response to environmental stimuli . As Rho - family GTPases are , however , likely to be required for events such as dendritic cell migration and interaction with T cells , which take place downstream of the early phase of constitutive endocytosis , it may be advantageous to maintain active GTPases and instead modulate down - stream effector systems . Analysis of the changes in gene expression that take place on dendritic cell maturation may provide further information . Materials and methods Cell culture Dendritic cell populations from the spleens of 8 – 16 - week - old female C57BL / 6 mice were expanded in low - attachment six - well plates ( Corning - Costar ) in the presence of 20 ng / ml GM – CSF and 1 ng / ml TGF - b as described previously [ 27 ] . Cells were generally used after 14 – 28 days of culture . Where indicated , the cultures were treated with LPS ( Escherichia coli 026 : B6 ; Sigma ) at 1 m g / ml for 40 h to induce maturation . A representative FACS analysis of day 0 spleen and the day 14 immature DC population can be seen in Supplementary mater - ial . The mouse B - lymphoma line A20 and thymoma line EL4 were main - tained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % FCS , 1 mM pyruvate , 1 · non - essential amino acids , 2 mM glutamine , 100 m g / ml kanamycin and 50 m M b - mercaptoethanol ( complete RPMI ) . Fusion proteins and probes Recombinant GST fusion proteins with V12Rac1 , V12A35Rac1 , V12N17Rac1 , N17Cdc42 , C . botulinum C3 transferase ( a gift from L . Feig ) and the PAK CRIB domain ( human PAK1B amino acids 59 – 272 , kindly provided by A . Hall ) were expressed and purified essentially as described in [ 13 ] , with the following exceptions . For GST – PAK purification , the bacterial lysates additionally contained 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 and 10 % glycerol , and GST – PAK was eluted from the glutathione – sepharose beads with 15 mM glutathione , before dial - ysis against 100 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT and 10 % glycerol . The GST moiety of the other fusion pro - teins was removed by digestion while still bound to the glutathione – agarose beads , in 100 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 2 . 5 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , with bovine thrombin ( Sigma ) at 5 U per ml of beads for 1 h at room temperature . The supernatants that contained the GST - free proteins were treated with p - aminobenza - midine – agarose ( Sigma ) to remove thrombin , before dialysis against 100 mM KCl , 20 mM Hepes pH 7 . 3 , 2 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT ( microinjection buffer ) and concentration . All fusion proteins were snap - frozen in small aliquots and stored at – 80°C . Allophycocyanin ( Calbiochem ) was chemically coupled to a synthetic peptide containing the SV40 large T antigen nuclear localisation signal ( CGGGPKKKRKVED ) as described [ 54 ] , dialysed into microinjection buffer and stored as small aliquots at – 80°C . Microinjection SDCs ( 2 . 5 · 10 5 ) were plated on 13 mm glass coverslips in complete RPMI medium for 2 – 3 h before microinjection . The cells were co - injected in the cytoplasm with APC – NLS at 2 mg / ml and recombinant proteins , as indicated , at the following total protein concentrations : V12Rac1 ( 1 . 3 mg / ml ) , V12A35Rac1 ( 0 . 4 mg / ml ) , V12N17Rac ( 0 . 4 mg / ml ) , N17Cdc42 ( 0 . 7 mg / ml ) , C3 transferase ( 2 m g / ml ) . Approximately 150 cells per coverslip were injected in 10 min using an Eppendorf Tran - sjector 5246 and a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope fitted with a 37°C heated chamber . The cells were further incubated for 20 min at 37°C before FITC – dextran internalisation or fixation and staining for actin . FITC – dextran uptake and fluorescence microscopy Macropinocytosis was assessed by FITC – dextran uptake as described previously [ 27 ] . For the non - adherant A20 and EL4 cell lines , 2 · 10 5 cells were centrifuged onto slides at 200 rpm for 2 min ( Shandon Cytospin 3 ) before fixation . Where indicated , cells were treated for 30 min with 100 ng / ml toxin B before uptake , or were pretreated for 15 min with 100 nM wortmannin ( Alexis Biochemicals ) , then wortman - nin was included in the FITC – dextran incubation . Actin structures were visualised after fixation and staining with TRITC – phalloidin as described previously [ 27 ] . Images were collected on a Zeiss LSM 410 laser scan - ning microscope using a · 63 , NA1 . 4 Planapochromatic objective . Affinity precipitation , immunoprecipitation and cell fractionation For affinity precipitation of active Rac and Cdc42 , SDCs were resus - pended at 10 7 cells / ml in 100 mM NaCl , 25 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 1 % NP - 40 , 5 % glycerol , 5 mM MgCl 2 containing leupeptin ( 50 m M ) , pepstatin A ( 10 m M ) , chymostatin ( 10 m g / ml ) and AEBSF ( 100 m g / ml ; ICN ) . GST or GST – PAK ( 25 m g ) was added immediately to each sample . After lysis for 15 min at 4°C and centrifugation at 2500 g for 5 min to remove debris , 25 m l of glutathione – sepharose suspension was added , and the samples incubated for 30 min at 4°C with mixing . Control lysates were treated with 10 mM EDTA for 20 min at 30°C in the presence of 1 mM GDP or 0 . 5 mM GTP g S , then MgCl 2 was added to 30 mM before precipitation with GST – PAK and glutathione – sepharose . Precipitated complexes were washed four times with lysis buffer , then analysed by western blot - ting . Rac and Cdc42 were detected using monoclonal antibody 23A8 and polyclonal anti - Cdc42 ( Santa Cruz ) , respectively . For immunoprecipi - tation of Vav , SDCs ( 8 · 10 6 ) were lysed in 40 mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 , 5 mM EDTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 , containing phosphatase inhibitors NaF ( 50 mM ) , Na 4 P 2 O 7 ( 30 mM ) , Na 3 VO 4 ( 1 mM ) and pro - tease inhibitors as above . Lysates were immunoprecipitated with 5 m g anti - Vav polyclonal antibody ( UBI ) and protein A – sepharose and total Vav or tyrosine - phosphorylated Vav was detected by western blotting using the same anti - Vav antibody or monoclonal PY - 20 ( Transduction Labs ) . Detection with PY - 20 could be completely competed by the inclusion of 2 . 5 mM o - phosphotyrosine ( data not shown ) . 846 Current Biology Vol 10 No 14 For membrane fractionation , SDCs ( 5 · 10 6 / sample ) were resuspended in lysis / breakage buffer [ 55 ] , broken by 10 passages through a ball - bearing homogeniser , and post - nuclear supernatants ( PNS ) prepared by centrifugation at 1000 · g for 10 min . In control samples , PNS were incubated with 1 mM GTP g S for 10 min at 37°C . Membrane and cytosol fractions were separated at 100 , 000 · g for 20 min at 4°C , and the membranes washed once in lysis / breakage buffer to remove contami - nating cytosolic proteins . Rac levels in each fraction were measured by western blotting .
