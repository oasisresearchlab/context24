Epsin consists of an epsin NH 2 - terminal homology domain that promotes interaction with phospholipids , several AP - 2 - binding sites , two clathrin - binding sequen - ces and several Eps15 homology domain - binding motifs . Epsin additionally possesses ubiquitin - interacting motifs ( UIMs ) and has been demonstrated to bind ubiquitinated cargo . We therefore investigated whether epsin pro - moted clathrin - mediated endocytosis of the ubiquiti - nated EGF receptor ( EGFR ) . By immunoprecipitation , we found that epsin 1 interacted with ubiquitinated EGFR and that functional UIMs were essential for complex formation . Furthermore , RNA interference - mediated knockdown of epsin 1 was found to inhibit internalization of the EGFR , while having no effect on endocytosis of the transferrin receptor . Additionally , upon knockdown of epsin 1 , translocation of the EGFR to central parts of clathrin - coated pits was inhibited . This supports the contention that epsin 1 promotes endocytosis of the ubiquitinated EGFR . Key words : AP - 2 , clathrin - coated pit , EGF receptor , epsin , ubiquitin Received 20 December 2007 , revised and accepted for publication 17 November 2008 , uncorrected manuscript published online 20 November 2008 Endocytosis of the EGF receptor ( EGFR ) has been dem - onstrated to be clathrin dependent ( 1 – 5 ) . Recent studies have suggested that the clathrin adaptor protein complex , AP - 2 , plays different roles in endocytosis of the transferrin receptor ( TfR ) and EGFR ( 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 ) . Whereas AP - 2 is strictly required for TfR internalization ( 3 ) , small and nonstoichio - metric amounts of AP - 2 appear sufficient for endocytosis of the EGFR in HeLa cells ( 7 ) . This is , however , in contrast to previous interpretations arguing that AP - 2 has the same general role in endocytosis of TfR and EGFR ( 4 ) . If AP - 2 is not required for interaction with ligand - activated EGFR , but rather in clathrin - coated vesicle formation , a different adaptor protein must be required . In this study , we have therefore addressed whether the clathrin - , AP - 2 - and ubiquitin - binding protein epsin functions as the cargo - binding adaptor in endocytosis of the EGFR . There are currently at least three known mammalian variants of epsin proteins ( epsin 1 , 2 and 3 ) ( 8 – 10 ) . All epsin proteins are characterized by having an N - terminal epsin NH 2 - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain that binds to phosphatidylinosi - tol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) ( 11 , 12 ) . Directly adjacent to the ENTH domain are two or three ( depending on splice variations ) tandem ubiquitin - interacting motifs ( UIMs ) ( 10 , 13 ) . The central region of epsin contains a clathrin interac - tion motif as well as repeats of a DPW motif , which binds to AP - 2 ( 14 , 15 ) . The C - terminal region contains an LVDLD sequence , which binds to clathrin ( 16 – 18 ) , as well as repeats of the NPF motif , which binds to Eps15 homology ( EH ) domains in proteins like Eps15 and POB1 ( 18 , 19 ) . Outside the ENTH domain , epsin is an intrinsically unstructured poly - peptide ( 20 ) that undergoes local disorder – order transitions . Epsin has been demonstrated to act as adaptor protein in clathrin - mediated endocytosis of ubiquitinated proteins ( 21 – 25 ) , and interaction of the EGFR with epsin has further been demonstrated ( 26 ) . The EGFR is ubiquitinated upon activa - tion , butithasbeenunclearwhetheritispolyubiquitinatedor multiply monoubiquitinated ( 27 , 28 ) . Recently , however , mass spectrometric analysis revealed that the EGFR is both polyubiquitinatedandmultiubiquitinatedwithin5 minofEGF addition ( 29 ) . Epsin was recently demonstrated to efficiently bind polyubiquitinated cargo through its UIMs ( 21 , 22 ) , and epsin homologs in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans have been demonstrated to be involved in endocytosis of ubiquitinated proteins in the Notch pathway ( 30 , 31 ) . The role of epsin as a dedicated ubiquitin adaptor specifically in clathrin - mediated endocytosis has , however , been ques - tioned ( 32 ) . It was found that deletion of the central AP - 2 - and clathrin - binding segment of epsin 1 facilitates colocal - ization of this epsin mutant with a ubiquitin reporter construct present on endosomes . Furthermore , clathrin RNA interference causes a similar redistribution of epsin 1 , so it was suggested that ubiquitin binding impairs epsin’s clathrin - binding ability and vice versa ( 32 ) . In this study , we have investigated whether epsin 1 interacts with the ubiquitinated EGFR and whether epsin www . traffic . dk 235 1 is required for endocytosis of the EGFR . Our present data suggest that epsin 1 interacts with ubiquitinated EGFR through its UIMs . Short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) - mediated downregulation of epsin 1 was found to modestly inhibit internalization of the EGF - bound EGFR , while having no effect on internalization of the TfR , suggesting that epsin 1 was specifically involved in endocytosis of the EGFR . Interestingly , in cells where epsin 1 had been knocked down by the use of siRNA , the activated EGFR was found to localize to the rims and not to the central parts of clathrin - coated pits , strongly suggesting that epsin 1 is required for recruitment of the ubiquitinated EGFR into clathrin - coated pits . Together , our findings argue that clathrin - dependent endocytosis of ubiquitinated EGFR is promoted by interaction with epsin 1 . Results Epsin interacts with ubiquitinated EGFR in a UIM - dependent manner Because epsin contains UIMs capable of binding ubiquiti - nated cargo ( 21 , 22 , 32 , 33 ) , we investigated whether epsin 1 interacted with ligand - activated and ubiquitinated EGFR . We did not manage to immunoprecipitate endogenous epsin with available antibodies . HeLa cells were therefore transfected with a plasmid encoding the Myc - tagged wild - type ( wt ) epsin 1 or with plasmids encoding either a Myc - tagged epsin 1 UIM mutant , unable to bind ubiquitinated proteins , or a Myc - tagged truncated form of epsin 1 ( ENTH - UIM ) lacking AP - 2 - and clathrin - binding sequences ( see Figure 1 for an overview of the epsin 1 constructs used in this work ) . The cells were subsequently incubated with or without EGF ( 60 ng / mL ) for 3 min at 37 8 C . Wt epsin 1 and the epsin 1 mutants were immunopreci - pitated using anti - Myc antibody , and the immunoprecipi - tated material was subjected to western blotting with an antibody to the EGFR . As demonstrated in Figure 2A , ubiquitinated EGFR coimmunoprecipitated with both wt epsin 1 and ENTH - UIM part of epsin 1 upon activation of the EGFR . Interestingly , the EGFR did not coimmunopre - cipitate with the UIM mutant of epsin 1 . These experi - ments demonstrated that functional UIMs are required for formation of an EGFR – epsin complex . However , as the data do not clearly demonstrate that the epsin – EGFR interaction is direct , we cannot rule out the possibility that epsin 1 is recruited through another ubiquitinated protein bound to the EGFR . Because the ENTH - UIM part of epsin 1 interacted more efficiently with the EGFR than did full - length epsin 1 , we took advantage of this truncated epsin in immunoprecipitation experiments . Human Sprouty2 ( hSpry2 ) has previously been demon - strated to inhibit both ubiquitination and internalization of the EGFR by interacting with Cbl and thereby attenuate Cbl’s ubiquitin ligase activity ( 34 – 36 ) . To verify that the interaction between epsin 1 and the EGFR was dependent on ubiquitination of the EGFR , HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding the FLAG - tagged ENTH - UIM part of epsin 1 alone or together with a plasmid encoding Myc - tagged hSpry2 . In doubly transfected cells , reduced amounts of the EGFR coimmunoprecipitated with the ENTH - UIM part of epsin 1 ( Figure 2B ) , suggesting that epsin 1 interacts poorly with the EGFR when ubiquitination of the EGFR is inhibited . It should be noted that the fraction of EGFR coprecipitating with ENTH - UIM in the presence of hSpry2 was clearly ubiquitinated ( see ‘upsmearing’ of the EGFR band compared with the band in lysate from cells not incubated with EGF ) . To further verify this contention , we made use of stably transfected PAE cells expressing either wt - EGFR or Y1045F - EGFR . When phosphorylated , pY1045 serves as a major docking site for Cbl . The Y1045F - EGFR was previously demonstrated to have reduced ubiquitination upon ligand - induced activation but to be efficiently internalized ( 37 , 38 ) . PAE cells stably expressing wt - EGFR or Y1045F - EGFR were incubated with and without EGF ( 60 ng / mL ) for 3 min at 37 8 C . EGFR was then immunoprecipitated , and the precipitated mate - rial was western blotted using anti - ubiquitin antibody . As demonstrated ( Figure 3A ) , ubiquitination of the Y1045F - EGFR was in fact substantial and upon quantification was estimated to be approximately 30 % that of the wt - EGFR . PAE cells stably expressing wt - EGFR or Y1045F - EGFR were subsequently transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding the Myc - tagged ENTH - UIM part of epsin 1 . The cells were then incubated with or without EGF ( 60 ng / mL ) for 3 min at 37 8 C . The Myc - tagged ENTH - UIM part of epsin 1 was immunoprecipitated using anti - Myc antibody , and the immunoprecipitated material was subjected to western blotting with an antibody to the EGFR . As demonstrated in Figure 3B , comparable amounts of EGFR coimmunoprecipitated with the ENTH - UIM part of epsin 1 when using lysate from cells expressing wt - EGFR or Y1045F - EGFR . This was somewhat surprising but sug - gests that although the amount of ubiquitin added to the Y1045F - EGFR was reduced , the ubiquitin added was Figure 1 : Schematic overview of the rat epsin 1 constructs used . ENTH domain binds to PIP2 . 236 Traffic 2009 ; 10 : 235 – 245 Kazazic et al . quantitatively and qualitatively sufficient for efficient inter - action with epsin 1 to take place ( see Discussion ) . Alto - gether , our data argue that ubiquitination of the EGFR promotes formation of epsin – EGFR complexes and further that the ubiquitinated EGFR binds to epsin 1 through epsin’s UIMs . The results with the Y1045F mutant show additionally that low levels of EGFR ubiquitination are sufficient to engage epsin 1 through the UIMs . siRNA - mediated knockdown of epsin 1 specifically inhibited endocytosis of the EGFR by inhibiting translocation of the EGFR into clathrin - coated pits To confirm that epsin has a functional role in endocytosis of the EGFR , we knocked down epsin 1 by siRNA . In HeLa cells , two different target sequences were used , and both duplexes ( Dup1 and Dup3 ) ( 4 ) downregulated epsin 1 efficiently ( Figure 4A ) . We then measured the rate of EGF internalization using 1 ng / mL 125 I - EGF in cells trans - fected with or without siRNA to epsin 1 . Downregulation of epsin 1 , using either of the two siRNA duplexes , inhibited internalization of EGF ( the ratio of internalized to surface localized EGF was reduced by 45 % upon 5 - min incubation ) ( Figure 4B ) , while knockdown of epsin 1 had no effect on endocytosis of Tf ( Figure 4C ) . We also trans - fected cells with siRNA to green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) to rule out that transfection with siRNA as such affected EGF internalization ( data not shown ) . In conclusion , our results support the contention that epsin 1 is specifically involved in endocytosis of the EGFR as cargo selective adaptor . It should be noted that in contrast to data reported by Sigismund et al . ( 26 ) , our present data clearly demon - strated that even 1 ng / mL EGF induced relatively efficient ubiquitination of the EGFR ( Figure S1 ) . The fact that efficient depletion of epsin 1 did not affect endocytosis of Tf demonstrated that depletion of epsin 1 did not affect formation of clathrin - coated pits and vesicles in general [ formation of clathrin - coated pits was also confirmed by electron microscopy ( see below ) ] . This argues that epsin 1 does not have an important universal role in curving and tubulation of membranes ( 12 , 39 ) . We further wanted to investigate to what extent knock - down of epsin 1 inhibited endocytosis of the less effi - ciently ubiquitinated Y1045F - EGFR compared with wt - EGFR . In PAE cells stably expressing either wt - EGFR or Y1045F - EGFR , epsin 1 was targeted using Dup3 ( Figure 5A ) . Figure 2 : Epsin 1 interacts with ubiquitinated EGFR through its UIMs . A ) HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wt epsin 1 , the N - terminal ENTH - UIM part of epsin 1 or the UIM mutant of epsin 1 incapable of binding ubiquitin . All epsin variants were Myc tagged . Twenty - four hours after transfection the cells were incubated with or without 60 ng / mL EGF for 3 min at 37 8 C . The cells were then subjected to immunoprecipitation using antibody to Myc and analyzed by western blotting using antibodiesto EGFR and Myc . B ) HeLa cells transfected with plasmids encoding the FLAG - tagged ENTH - UIM part of epsin 1 either alone or together with a plasmid encoding Myc - tagged hSpry2 were incubated with or without 60 ng / mL EGF for 3 min at 37 8 C . The ENTH - UIM part of epsin was immunoprecipitated with antibody to FLAG , and the precipitated material was subjected to western blotting with antibodies to EGFR and FLAG . Overexpression of hSpry2 in transfected cells was demonstrated using antibody to Myc . Figure 3 : Ubiquitinated wt - and Y1045F - EGFR interact with the ENTH - UIM part of epsin 1 . A ) PAE cells expressing wt - EGFR or Y1045F - EGFR were incubated with or without 60 ng / mL EGF for 3 min at 37 8 C as indicated .

B ) PAE cells expressing wt - EGFR or Y1045F - EGFR were transiently transfected with the Myc - tagged ENTH - UIM part of epsin 1 . Twenty - four hours after transfection the cells were incubated with or without 60 ng / mL EGF for 3 min at 37 8 C . The cells were then subjected to coimmunoprecipitation analysis using antibody to Myc and analyzed by western blotting using antibodies to EGFR and Myc . Traffic 2009 ; 10 : 235 – 245 237 Epsin Localizes Ubiquitinated EGFR to Coated Pits We measured the rate of EGF internalization using 1 ng / mL 125 I - EGF in cells transfected with or without siRNA to epsin 1 . The siRNA - mediated knockdown of epsin 1 inhibited the endocytosis rate of EGF by approximately 40 % ( upon 5 - min incubation ) whether the cells expressed wt - EGFR or Y1045F - EGFR ( Figure 5B , C ) . This is consistent with our finding that wt - EGFR and Y1045F - EGFR both efficiently interacted with the ENTH - UIM part of epsin 1 and that this facilitated endocytosis . It should be noted that the rate of EGF internalization in HeLa cells endogenously expressing EGFR and in PAE cells expressing wt - EGFR or Y1045F - EGFR upon stable transfection varies . The reason for this is most likely that Figure 4 : Epsin 1 is involved in EGFR but not in TfR endocytosis .

The data represent one independent experiment ( of three ) with four parallels (cid:1) SD . Figure 5 : Knockdown of epsin 1 inhibits endocytosis of wt - EGFR and Y1045F - EGFR .

To investigate at what step of clathrin - dependent endocy - tosis epsin 1 is required , we used immunolabeling of thawed cryosections and electron microscopy ( immuno - EM ) and stereological analysis to examine the effect of siRNA - mediated knockdown of epsin 1 in HeLa cells or PAE cells expressing wt - EGFR . The cells were incubated with or without EGF ( 60 ng / mL ) , and to avoid that EGFRs within interior parts of coated pits escaped quantification because of endocytic uptake , we incubated the cells on ice to prevent membrane budding . We have previously dem - onstrated that the EGFR is ubiquitinated on ice ( 38 ) . Incubation with EGF on ice was previously also demon - strated to cause colocalization of EGFR and AP - 2 ( 36 , 40 ) , and at the same time , endocytosis was inhibited . This allowed a precise quantification of EGFRs in coated pits . High concentrations of EGF were used to maximize activation - dependent recruitment of EGFRs into coated pits . As demonstrated in Figure S2 , downregulation of epsin 1 inhibited endocytosis of the EGFR also at 60 ng / mL . In nontransfected HeLa cells , 1 . 3 (cid:1) 0 . 9 % of the EGFR at the plasma membrane localized inside coated pits in the absence of EGF , while in the presence of EGF , 9 . 5 (cid:1) 2 . 5 % of the EGFR localized inside coated pits ( Table 1 and Figure 6A ) . In HeLa cells where epsin 1 had been knocked down , 0 . 4 (cid:1) 0 . 3 % of the EGFR localized inside coated pits in the absence of EGF , while upon activation of the EGFR , only 5 . 7 (cid:1) 0 . 5 % of the EGFR showed this localization ( Table 1 ) . This decrease is consistent with the diminished uptake of EGF seen in epsin 1 knockdown cells ( Figure 4 ) . Interestingly , in HeLa cells where epsin 1 was knocked down , a significant fraction ( 6 . 7 (cid:1) 0 . 5 % ) of the EGFR localized to the rim of coated pits in the presence of EGF ( Figure 6B ) , while in nontransfected cells , only 1 . 0 (cid:1) 0 . 8 % of the EGFR localized to the rim of the coats ( Table 1 ) . This could indicate a role of epsin 1 in recruitment of cargo into clathrin - coated pits . The number of coated pits at the plasma membrane in epsin 1 knockdown cells was found to be as in control cells ( data not shown ) , and immuno - EM experiments with labeling for a - adaptin demonstrated that the amount of AP - 2 in coated pits was comparable with that of nontransfected cells ( data not shown ) . In principle , the same inhibitory effect of knocking down epsin 1 was found on recruitment of EGFR to clathrin - coated pits in PAE cells stably expressing wt - EGFR ( Figure 7 and Table 1 ) . However , these cells showed more intense antibody labeling for EGFR at the plasma membrane than did HeLa cells because of higher expression . It has been reported that epsin 1 is a driving force in the curvature of clathrin - coated pits ( 12 ) . Figure 7 , however , clearly dem - onstrates coated pits at all stages of invagination also in epsin 1 knockdown cells . Furthermore , as demonstrated in Figure 4 , siRNA to epsin 1 did not affect TfR endocytosis , confirming that epsin 1 knockdown did not affect forma - tion of clathrin - coated pits . Interestingly , recruitment of activated EGFR to clathrin - coated pits was additionally strongly inhibited upon over - expression of the ENTH - UIM part of epsin 1 ( Table 2 ) . This argues that the clathrin - and AP - 2 - binding parts of epsin are required to translocate the UIM - bound ubiquitinated EGFR to clathrin - coated pits . It should be noted that it has previously been reported that knockdown of epsin 1 did not affect endocytosis of the EGFR ( 4 , 26 ) . In initial experiments , we could also not observe inhibitory effects on endocytosis of EGF by knocking down epsin 1 . However , as demonstrated in Figure S3 , using the same siRNA duplexes as used by Huang et al . ( 4 ) , the knockdown of epsin 1 was more efficient when cells were transfected twice with a 48 - h interval than when transfected once . In both cases , epsin 1 knockdown was evaluated 48 h after the last siRNA transfection . We therefore believe that our more efficient knockdown of epsin 1 explains the observed inhibitory effect on endocytosis of EGF . It should further be noted that we were not successful in rescuing the inhibitory effect on endocytosisbyexpressingsiRNA - resistantepsin1 . Thisisprobably because of our finding that overexpression of epsin 1 sequestered AP - 2 and clathrin and therefore Table 1 : Knockdown of epsin 1 causes localization of activated EGFR to the rim of clathrin - coated pits a HeLa PAE % EGFR in coated pits % EGFR in coated pits EGF Inside Rim Number of Au Inside Rim Number of Au Control (cid:2) 1 . 3 (cid:1) 0 . 9 0 358 0 . 4 (cid:1) 0 . 2 0 . 2 (cid:1) 0 . 2 1089 Control þ 9 . 5 (cid:1) 2 . 5 1 (cid:1) 0 . 8 379 4 . 4 (cid:1) 0 . 9 2 . 3 (cid:1) 0 . 6 1084 Epsin 1 siRNA (cid:2) 0 . 4 (cid:1) 0 . 3 0 . 5 (cid:1) 0 . 7 437 0 . 3 (cid:1) 0 . 1 0 . 1 (cid:1) 0 . 1 1320 Epsin 1 siRNA þ 5 . 7 (cid:1) 0 . 5 6 . 7 (cid:1) 0 . 5 450 1 . 5 (cid:1) 0 . 4 2 . 4 (cid:1) 0 . 6 1427 a HeLa cells or PAE cells expressing wt - EGFR , treated with Lipofectamine 2000 without ( control ) or with siRNA to epsin 1 [ Dup1 ( HeLa ) or Dup3 ( PAE ) ] were incubated with or without EGF ( 60 ng / mL ) for 1 h on ice and processed for immuno - EM and labeled with antibodies to the EGFR .

Traffic 2009 ; 10 : 235 – 245 239 Epsin Localizes Ubiquitinated EGFR to Coated Pits non - specifically inhibited clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Figure S4 ) . Discussion It has been reported that epsin can act as adaptor protein for the endocytosis of ubiquitinated proteins ( 21 – 25 , 32 ) , as well as other uncharacterized cargo receptors ( 41 ) in mammalian cells , and we now report that siRNA - mediated knockdown of epsin 1 mildly inhibited EGF - induced endo - cytosis of the EGFR . This is similar to the mild effect of siRNA - mediated knockdown of epsin 1 on KSHV - mediated internalization of major histocompatibility complex I ( 23 ) . The remaining endocytosis may be because of existence of other yet unidentified ubiquitin - binding proteins . One candidate could be epsin 2 . However , our unpublished results have demonstrated that siRNA - mediated knock - down of epsin 2 non - specifically inhibited clathrin - dependent endocytosis . We further report that in the absence of epsin 1 , the EGFR was inefficiently recruited to the interior regions of clathrin - coated pits but was instead found to localize to the rim of such coats . The UIM - containing protein Eps15 has also been reported to localize to the rim of clathrin - coated pits ( 42 – 44 ) , and the edge - like localization of EGFR observed could thus potentially be explained by the ubiquitinated EGFR binding to Eps15 . In contrast to Eps15 , epsin 1 was found localized to all parts of clathrin - coated pits ( 36 , 45 ) . Our present data thus suggest that under normal condi - tions , the EGF - activated and ubiquitinated EGFR initially interacts with Eps15 in a transient manner but is rapidly handed over to epsin 1 to enter central regions of clathrin - coated pits . Indeed , we demonstrated coimmunoprecipita - tion of epsin 1 with ubiquitinated EGFR . We also confirmed that intact UIMs were essential for binding the EGFR to epsin 1 . Our data thus suggest that epsin’s ability to bind ubiquitinated EGFR is important in clathrin - dependent en - docytosis of the EGFR by recruiting the EGFR into clathrin - coated pits . Transient binding of the EGFR to Eps15 and subsequent handing off to epsin 1 localized inside the Eps15 - positive edge of clathrin - coated pits would ensure packaging of the ubiquitinated EGFR in the invaginating section of the pit . This would be very similar to the des - cribed co - operation of Golgi - localized , g - ear - containing , Arf binding proteins ( GGAs ) and AP - 1 in packaging of mannose 6 - phosphate receptors at the trans Golgi network ( 46 ) . It should be noted that the ENTH - UIM part of epsin 1 binds ubiquitinated EGFR more efficiently than does full - length epsin 1 . This is partly consistent with the notion that clathrin binding negatively regulates epsin’s binding of ubiquitinated cargo ( 32 ) . However , it should further be noticed that overexpression of the ENTH - UIM part of epsin 1 not containing AP - 2 - and clathrin - binding sequences was found to efficiently exclude the EGFR from clathrin - coated pits . In this regard , the ENTH - UIM part in fact acts in a dominant - negative fashion . Because the EGFR was excluded from coated pits under these conditions , the ubiquitinated EGFR coimmunoprecipitating with the tagged ENTH - UIM was not localized to coated pits . These data clearly show that ubiquitinated EGFR interacts with UIMs in epsin 1 , and we suggest that when the N - terminal part of epsin 1 is positioned within the clathrin lattice by means of the C - terminal clathrin - , AP - 2 - and Eps15 - binding information , it will use the UIMs for cargo recognition . This was in fact suggested in direct biochemical experiments ( 21 ) . Also , the dominant - negative effect of the ENTH - UIM part of epsin 1 is very reminiscent of what was observed when the tandem Dab2 PTB domain was overexpressed . Like the ENTH - UIM , the 2xPTB domain couples a PIP 2 - binding site with a cargo recognition interface , and overexpression blocked LDL receptors from entering clathrin - coated pits ( 47 ) . The endocytosis rates of wt - EGFR and Y1045F - EGFR were identical and so was the inhibitory effect of epsin 1 siRNA on endocytosis . As the interaction between EGFR and epsin 1 depends on ubiquitination ( shown by inhibition of Cbl’s ubiquitin ligase activity by hSpry2 overexpression ) and on intact UIMs , we believe that it is reasonable to suggest that the ubiquitination of the Y1045F - EGFR , although reduced , is sufficient for interaction with epsin 1 and thus for efficient endocytosis of EGFR . There are different possible reasons why this reduced ubiquitination could be sufficient . ( i ) The required stoichiometry of the epsin – EGFR interaction is not known , but because of , for Figure 6 : Knockdown of epsin 1 causes localization of acti - vated EGFR to the rim of clathrin - coated pits in HeLa cells . HeLa cells were incubated with Lipofectamine 2000 without ( A ) or with ( B ) siRNA to epsin 1 ( Dup1 ) as described in Materials and Methods . The cells were then incubated with EGF ( 60 ng / mL ) for 1 h on ice and subsequently processed for immuno - EM and labeled with antibodies to the EGFR .

Increased ubiquitination will therefore not necessarily increase the number of epsin molecules interacting with each EGFR , which will explain why the same amount of Y1045F - EGFR and wt - EGFR was precipitated along with epsin ENTH - UIM . ( ii ) wt - EGFR has been shown to be both mono - and polyubiquitinated , and the polyubiquitin chains were demonstrated to be largely K63 linked ( 29 ) . Epsin has also been demonstrated to efficiently interact with K63 - linked polyubiquitin chains in biochemical experiments ( 21 ) . Interestingly , Y1045F - EGFR was found to have a simi - lar ubiquitin linkage profile as wt - EGFR with mainly K63 linkages ( 29 ) , and this could explain the efficiency of endocytosis because of the capacity of K63 - linked poly - ubiquitin to interact with epsin . Based on the observation that EGFR mutants with minimal ubiquitination were endocytosed at the same rate as was wt - EGFR , it was recently stated that ubiquitination of EGFR is not required for its endocytosis ( 48 ) . However , in that paper , it was clearly demonstrated that in kinase - deficient EGFR mutants , endocytosis was in fact rescued by ubiquitination . This is consistent with our present results , which seem to indicate that relatively small amounts of ubiquitin are sufficient for endocytosis of EGFR . Such low amounts of ubiquitin could in many cases be possibly undetectable by standard biochemical methods ( 49 ) . Our results demonstrate that epsin 1 is involved in recruitment of ubiquitinated EGFR to coated pits because siRNA - mediated knockdown of epsin 1 inhibited EGF - induced recruitment of the EGFR to clathrin - coated pits . Figure 7 : Knockdown of epsin 1 causes localization of activated EGFR to the rim of clathrin - coated pits in PAE cells . PAE cells stably expressing wt - EGFR were incubated with Lipofectamine 2000 without ( A – C ) or with ( D – I ) siRNA to epsin 1 ( Dup3 ) as described in Materials and Methods . The cells were then incubated without ( A and D ) or with EGF ( 60 ng / mL ) ( B , C and E – I ) for 1 h on ice and subsequently processed for immuno - EM and labeled with antibody to EGFR ( arrowheads ) . Note the EGF - induced relocalization of EGFR into coated pits ( c . p . ) in control cells and to the rim of coated pits in epsin siRNA - treated cells . Bar , 100 nm . Traffic 2009 ; 10 : 235 – 245 241 Epsin Localizes Ubiquitinated EGFR to Coated Pits One possibility for the requirement of epsin 1 could be that extensive modification of the EGFR tail with formation of polyubiquitin chains as well as multiple monoubiquitination ( 29 ) could interfere with the direct EGFR – AP - 2 interaction ( 50 ) either because of masking of dileucine and tyrosine internalization sequences or because of conformational changes in the EGFR tail . We further speculate that in the absence of EGFR ubiquitination , other adaptor proteins , such as AP - 2 , could recruit the EGFR to coated pits direc - tly . But failure to detect large amounts of EGFR in clathrin - coated regions of the plasma membrane in the absence of added EGF ( Tables 1 and 2 ) indicates that these signals are not constitutively very active or that the EGFR is restricted to surface domains that prevent entry into clathrin - coated pits in the absence of activation . In conclusion , we favor the idea that in case of ubiquitinated EGFR at the plasma membrane , epsin 1 can act as cargo - associated sorting protein , participating in cargo capture and concentration of ubiquitinated EGFR in clathrin - coated pits .

Table 2 : Overexpression of the ENTH - UIM part of epsin 1 inhibits recruitment of the activated EGFR into clathrin - coated pits a % EGFR in coated pits EGF Inside Rim Number of Au Control cells (cid:2) 1 . 7 (cid:1) 0 . 5 0 300 Control cells þ 11 . 9 (cid:1) 1 . 5 1 . 7 (cid:1) 1 . 2 304 ENTH - UIM (cid:2) 0 0 303 ENTH - UIM þ 0 . 9 (cid:1) 0 . 7 0 . 9 (cid:1) 0 . 7 341 a By immuno - EM , the plasma membrane distribution of the EGFR was quantified when nontransfected HeLa cells ( control ) , and HeLa cells overexpressing the Myc - tagged ENTH - UIM part of epsin 1 had been incubated with or without EGF ( 60 ng / mL ) for 1 h on ice . Transfected cells were identified using rabbit anti - Myc antibody . The EGFR localizing to the interior or to the rim of coated pits are presented as the percentage of the total labeling for EGFR found at the plasma membrane . The quantification represents the mean (cid:1) SD of three parallel labeling experiments . Number of Au indicates the total number of gold particles counted for each condition . 242 Traffic 2009 ; 10 : 235 – 245 Kazazic et al . To estimate the plasma membrane distribution of the EGFR , no less than 100 gold particles at the plasma membrane on randomly chosen HeLa cells or the total number of gold particles ( a minimum of 250 particles ) on 20 profiles of PAE cells were counted . As the anti - EGFR antibodies used for immuno - EM ( sc - 120 and Ab - 3 ) are directed against the extracellular part of the EGFR , the labeling is not affected by interactions of the EGFR with intracellular proteins . Labelingefficiency can therefore be ignored when only quantifying changesin labeling distribution .
