Different models are often constructed in heterogeneous formats . Thus , the integration of the models requires a standard language format that can effectively represent essential biological information . However , the previously introduced formats have limitations that prevent from adequately representing essential biological information , particularly specifications of bio - molecules and biological contexts . Results : We defined an XML - based markup language called context - oriented directed association markup language ( CODA - ML ) , which better represents essential biological information . The CODA - ML has two major strengths in designating molecular specifications and biological contexts . It can cover heterogeneous entity types involved in biological events ( e . g . gene / protein , compound , cellular function , disease ) . Molecular types of entities can have molecular specifications which include detailed information of a molecule from isoforms to modifications , enabling high - resolution representation of molecules . In addition , it can distinguish biological events that vary depending on different biological contexts such as cell types or disease conditions . Especially representation of inter - cellular events as well as intra - cellular events is available . These two major strengths can resolve contradictory associations when different models are integrated into one unified model , which improves the accuracy of the model . Conclusions : With the CODA - ML , diverse models such as signaling pathways , metabolic pathways , and gene regulatory pathways can be represented in a unified language format . Heterogeneous entity types can be covered by the CODA - ML , thus it enables detailed description for the mechanisms of diseases or drugs from multiple perspectives ( e . g . , molecule , function or disease ) . The CODA - ML is expected to help integrate different models into one systemic model in an efficient and effective . The unified model can be used to perform computational analysis not only for cancer but also for other complex diseases involving multiple organs beyond a single cell .

BMC Bioinformatics 2019 , 20 ( Suppl 10 ) : 248 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1186 / s12859 - 019 - 2812 - 7 Background The development of high - throughput experiments such as yeast two - hybrid has led to the discovery of various biological relations that comprise complex biological systems . Systemic analysis of such complex biological systems requires computational modeling that accurately depicts the systems . Especially , complex diseases such as type 2 diabetes involve interactions between multiple organs , tissues , or cells . Therefore , computational ana - lysis for those complex diseases requires the integration of several different models into one unified model to carry out a systemic analysis of multiple organs . To this end , an integrative model needs to cover multiple inter - connected organs to enable a comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms of complex diseases or drugs across the whole human body . Moreover , if an integrative model covers heterogeneous biological events between different types of entities such as molecules , cellular functions , or diseases , it would be better for elucidating the mecha - nisms of diseases or drugs from the perspective of how molecular changes lead to functional changes and then to phenotypic changes . Different models have been often created in heteroge - neous formats , limiting the integration and interopera - tion among them . To resolve such a problem , it needs a standard format to represent many biological events from different models . The aim of a standard format is to represent the essential information of biological events in an effective and efficient way , which improves the interoperability and interchangeability . To this end , the standard format should be able to represent specifi - cations of molecular types of entities such as molecule type , isoform , epigenetic / post - translational modifications so that an integrated model can capture the details of molecular interactions . In addition , because biological events are often differentially observed depending on biological contexts such as particular organs / tissues / cells or disease conditions , the standard format is expected to distinguish biological events that vary depending on the biological contexts such as anatomical contexts and environmental contexts . Of the molecular specifications and biological contexts required for a standard format , the former is expected to cover isoforms and modifications of molecular entities . A gene is one of the complicated molecule types with di - verse isoforms and modifications . Most of the previous models have not distinguished genes , transcripts , and proteins and have used symbols or ids of their coding genes [ 1 ] . Due to the insufficient information for the molecules involved in biological events , computational modeling has faced difficulties in distinguishing genes , transcripts , or proteins . However , state - of - the - art models provide biological events between molecules with their specific types and isoforms . With advancements in sequencing technology , the group for the Genotype - Tis - sue Expression ( GTEx ) project recently publicly released co - expression data of gene - gene , gene - transcript , and transcript - transcript pairs across 16 anatomical contexts with the aim to reveal the tissue - specific regulation of transcription and splicing [ 2 ] . For example , in the breast mammary , PCOLCE2 gene and a GSN - encoded tran - script have functional interactions with a co - expression correlation coefficient of 0 . 1 [ 3 ] . Because detailed infor - mation about biological events between specific types of molecules becomes available , it is now possible to differ - entiate molecules with different isoforms and to create more detailed integrative models . Molecules can have diverse modifications . Representa - tive modifications of genes , transcripts or proteins include epigenetic / post - translational modifications such as phosphorylation or methylation . These modifications often affect physical interactions with other molecules . For example , ATM - encoded protein increases the amount of BRCA1 - encoded protein with a phosphoryl group [ 4 ] . Because a protein differently exerts cellular functions depending on the presence of modifications such as phosphorylation , phosphorylated BRCA1 - encoded protein should be distinguished from non - phosphorylated BRCA1 - encoded protein . In addition to molecular specifications , biological con - texts are also important information to be considered when integrating numerous biological events . Essential groups of biological contexts include anatomical con - texts and environmental contexts . First , anatomical con - texts refer to organs , tissues or cells at which biological events are observed . Some biological events are generally observed at the majority of anatomical contexts , whereas some others are observed in specific anatomical con - texts . Thus , biological events need to be distinguished according to their anatomical contexts . As an example of molecule - function relationships , LEF1 in the hypo - thalamus is closely associated with hypothalamus devel - opment , whereas LEF1 in the blood vessel is rather closely associated with angiogenesis [ 5 ] . Anatomical con - texts are organized in a hierarchy in which organs are comprised of tissues which are comprised of cells [ 6 ] . Therefore , anatomical contexts for a biological event need to be designated in the format of organ , tissue , and cell . A biological event might be differently observed at different cell types in the same organ / tissue or at the same cell type in different organs / tissues . For example , the physical interaction between TSPAN6 and CLEC5A is observed at the glandular cells of the breast whereas it would not be observed at the myoepithelial cells or adi - pocytes of the breast [ 1 ] . Furthermore , a biological event can be a relationship either within a cell or between cells , tissue , or organs [ 7 ] . For an example of inter - organ relationships , epinephrine induced in the adrenal glands Kwon et al . BMC Bioinformatics 2019 , 20 ( Suppl 10 ) : 248 Page 46 of 80 binds to ADRA2A in the cerebellar cortex . Therefore , standard formats should be able to designate anatomical contexts respectively for each of epinephrine and ADRA2A , enabling to represent relationships between cells , tissue , or organs as well as relationships within a cell . Environmental contexts refer to conditions such as disease status or medicine treatments under which bio - logical events are observed . Biological events vary depending on the environmental contexts . For example , ESR1 is observed to significantly increase the expression of CCND1 under a breast cancer condition but not in a normal condition [ 8 ] . In addition , environmental con - texts can be complicatedly combined at the same time , resulting in changes in the relationship types of bio - logical events . In other words , a biological event between two proteins in a certain disease condition might be different from that in normal condition , and it might also be different from that under a combinatorial condi - tion in which a drug is treated under a disease condition [ 9 ] . Thus , standard formats need to be able to represent biological events with their single or multiple environ - mental contexts . Many groups have put forth efforts to define standard formats for improving interoperation and exchangeabil - ity between different models . The most representative formats are the Systems Biology Markup Language ( SBML ) [ 10 ] , Biological Expression Language ( BEL ; http : / / openbel . org / ) , and Biological Pathways eXchange ( BioPAX ) [ 11 ] . Even though these formats are widely used , they have limited ability for representing essential biological information , particularly molecular specifica - tions and biological contexts ( Table 1 ) . Some previous formats lack room for designating the specifications of biological entities such as isoforms and modifications . For instance , SBML does not provide a way to specify isoforms and modifications . Even though BEL can repre - sent modifications , they do not explicitly state how to differentiate the isoforms . Another previous format , Bio - Synergy Modeling Language ( BSML ) cannot repre - sent isoforms and modifications [ 12 ] . In addition , most of the previous formats have limited ability to represent biological contexts , including both anatomical and envir - onmental contexts . Even though SBML , BEL , and BioPAX are able to represent anatomical contexts , they allow only one anatomical context per biological entity . Thus , the hierarchical organization of the anatomical contexts cannot be represented with these languages ( e . g . , ‘ a protein in cell A of tissue B ’ ) . Moreover , none of the three languages consider environmental contexts . Even though they allow user - defined annotations to pro - vide room for non - considered information for each bio - logical relation , user - defined annotations are not in a standard format , limiting the interchangeability of the context information . The absence of a standard format to represent essential biological information , not only biological contexts but also molecular specifications , has limited the exchangeability and interoperation of highly detailed models . In this study , we aim to define an XML - based language format , the context - oriented directed associ - ation markup language ( CODA - ML ) that enable precise representation of biological events and effective integra - tions of different models . Basically , the CODA - ML consists of a triple ( i . e . subject , predicate , object ) and additional information where the format of a triplet is defined in the Resource Description Framework ( RDF - http : / / www . w3 . org / RDF / ) . Our main goal is to improve the representation of essential biological information , especially molecular specifications and biological con - texts . To achieve better representation of molecular specifications , the CODA - ML specifically designate mol - ecule types , isoforms , and modifications of molecules . In addition , the CODA - ML specifies anatomical contexts in a hierarchical organization for each of subject and object in a triple so that inter - cellular events as well as intra - cellular events can be precisely represented . The additional information of a triple includes following components : environmental contexts , the original predi - cate term in a reference model , species , reference model from which the event comes , and evidence score which is a supportive value for the event . It is expected to create a well - unified large - scale model by integrating biological events from multiple different models in the format of CODA - ML . Some example models are intro - duced to guide usage of this newly proposed standard language . The unified model can be used for a systemic analysis of mechanisms of drugs or diseases that are in - volved in multiple organs . Method Because each biological event is an atomic unit of the in - tegrative model , it is defined as a knowledge unit ( KU ) . A KU in the CODA - ML format is represented as a triple plus additional information ( Fig . 1 ) . A triple consists of a subject , a predicate , and an object in the same way as an RDF . Each subject and object may have one or more en - tities where an entity consists of entity cores and Table 1 Comparison with previous standard languages SBML BEL BioPax BSML CODA - ML Isoform X △ a O X O Modifications X O O X O Anatomical context △ b △ b △ b O O Environmental context X X X O O Inter - organ / tissue / cell relation O O O O O a It does not explicitly mention how to deal with transcript isoforms b It does not represent anatomical contexts in a hierarchical organization , thus only one anatomical context is possible Kwon et al . BMC Bioinformatics 2019 , 20 ( Suppl 10 ) : 248 Page 47 of 80 anatomical contexts . If an entity core is a molecular type , the entity core additionally includes molecular specifications . The predicate can be one of the con - trolled terms that are pre - defined to represent most of the possible biological relationships . The additional in - formation for a triple includes the environmental con - texts , the predicate in the reference , species , reference , and evidence score . A document type definition ( DTD ) of the CODA - ML describes its structure and ensures a standard way of writing its document ( Additional file 1 : Figure S1 ) . In the CODA - ML format , biological entities should be written in corresponding identifiers rather than employing plaintexts . The following ontologies are used as reference identifiers : Ensembl [ 13 ] for genes , transcripts and proteins , STITCH [ 14 ] for compounds , Gene Ontology [ 15 ] for biological processes and molecu - lar functions , UMLS [ 16 ] for ( patho ) phenotypes , and Medical Subject Headings ( MeSH ) [ 17 ] for organs , tissues , cells and species . In addition , to illustrate the utility of the CODA - ML , we represent diverse example KUs and example models that elucidate cellular signal - ing pathways or mechanisms of drug actions . Detailed elucidation for each component of the CODA - ML format will be in following the order : 1 ) subject , object , and their molecular specifications , 2 ) anatomical contexts and environmental contexts , 3 ) predicate , 4 ) others ( i . e . , reference , species , and evidence score ) . First , each subject and object has one or more entities where an entity consists of entity cores and ana - tomical contexts . The CODA - ML can cover heteroge - neous types of entity cores , including genes , compounds , biological processes , molecular functions , ( path ) phenotypes ( i . e . , diseases or symptoms ) , or other user - defined terms . The entities whose types are genes can additionally have a molecular specification elucidat - ing molecule type , isoform , and modifications . An entity core for a gene , a transcript or a protein is basically rep - resented with an identifier of its coding gene . The three elements of molecular specifications can be filled in according to the available information from the original model ( e . g . , ‘ ENSG00000012048 , DNA ’ or ‘ ENSG00000012048 , RNA , ENST00000354071 ’ where the Ensembl identifiers for ‘ BRCA1 ’ and one of its transcripts are , respectively , ‘ ENSG00000012048 ’ and ‘ ENST00000354071 ’ ) . For an example that given infor - mation is insufficient to fill in molecular specification , when a BRCA1 - originated protein whose isoform is speci - fied physically interacts with a BAP1 - originated protein whose isoform is not specified , the subject and the object of this KU become respectively ‘ BRCA1 , protein , ENSP00000312236 ’ and ‘ BAP1 , protein ’ ( Additional file 1 : Figure S2 ) . DNAs , RNAs , or proteins can have epigenetic or post - translational modifications ( e . g . , phosphorylation or methylation ) . Considering such molecular modifica - tions , this format distinguishes molecules with and with - out modifications ( e . g . ‘ ENSG00000012048 , protein , ENSP00000312236 ’ ) ≠ ‘ ENSG00000012048 , protein , ENSP00000312236 , phosphorylated ’ ) . Some entities may have multiple modifications at the same time ( e . g . ‘ ENSG00000 012048 , protein , ENSP00000312236 , phos - phorylated / methylated ’ ) . Each entity has three anatomical contexts in the for - mat of the hierarchical organization : an organ , a tissue , and a cell . In the case of an event observed within an Fig . 1 Overview of the CODA - ML . This figure shows overall components comprising the CODA - ML . A knowledge unit ( KU ) in the CODA - ML format is represented as a triple and its additional information . The triple consists of subject , predicate , and object where each of subject and object has one or more entities . An entity has entity cores and anatomical contexts . The possible entity core types are phenotype , biological process , molecular function , gene , and compound . Gene entity has molecular specifications . The anatomical contexts have an organ , a tissue , and a cell in the form of a hierarchical organization . The additional information of the triple includes environmental contexts , the predicate in reference , species , references , and evidence score Kwon et al . BMC Bioinformatics 2019 , 20 ( Suppl 10 ) : 248 Page 48 of 80 anatomical location ( i . e . , an intra - cellular event ) both of subject and object have identical anatomical contexts . For example , because luteinizing hormone receptor ( LHCGR ) in the ovary is related to primary follicle growth in the ovary [ 15 ] , subject and object of this KU identically have the ‘ D010053 ’ as anatomical contexts where the MeSH identifier for the ovary is ‘ D010053 ’ ( Additional file 1 : Figure S3 ) . On the other hand , in the case that an event is an interaction between entities in different anatomical contexts ( i . e . , an inter - cellular event ) , subject and object of this KU have different anatomical contexts . For example , because luteinizing hormone pro - duced in the pituitary gland induces estrogen in the granu - losa cell of the ovary [ 7 ] , anatomical contexts for the subject and the object of this KU , respectively , are ‘ D010902 ’ ( pituitary gland ) and ‘ D010053 , D006107 ’ ( ovary , granulosa cell ) ( Additional file 1 : Figure S4 ) . Inter - cellular events bridge not only cells but also tissues and organs that contain them . A KU can be represented without anatomical contexts in the CODA - ML if the modeling purposes do not require anatomical contexts specificity or if the original resources do not designate sufficient anatomical informa - tion for an event ( e . g . , the protein ESR1 physically interacts with the protein BRCA1 [ 18 ] ( Additional file 1 : Figure S5 ) , or ESR1 is a marker or mechanism of breast cancer [ 19 ] ( Additional file 1 : Figure S6 ) ) . Whereas anatomical contexts are specified for each of subject and object , environmental contexts are specified for a triple ( subject , predicate , and object ) . A KU with no environmental contexts implies that this biological event is observed in a normal condition without any perturbations . Each KU may have zero or more envir - onmental contexts such as disease condition , cell line condition , drug treatment , siRNA treatment , or herb treatment . For example , because the protein ESR1 increases the expression level of CCND1 in a breast cancer condition [ 4 ] , the environmental context for this KU becomes ‘ phenotype ’ - ‘ C0678222 ’ where the MeSH id for ‘ breast cancer ’ is ‘ C0678222 ’ ( Additional file 1 : Figure S7 ) . As another example , because resveratrol was confirmed to increase the cellular accumulation of doxorubicin in the MCF - 7 cell line [ 20 ] , the environ - mental context for this KU becomes ‘ cell line ’ - ‘ - CLO0007606 ’ where the CLO id for ‘ MCF - 7 ’ is ‘ CLO0007606 ‘ ( Additional file 1 : Figure S8 ) . A typical entity consists of a single entity core and the anatomical contexts , but some entities may involve mul - tiple entity cores . For example , because a protein complex composed of CCND1 ( ENSG00000110092 ) and CDK4 ( ENSG00000135446 ) phosphorylates RB1 - encoded pro - tein [ 4 ] , subject of this KU has two entity cores , ‘ ENSG00000110092 , protein ’ and ‘ ENSG00000135446 , protein ’ ( Additional file 1 : Figure S9 ) . Furthermore , the representative cases that require multiple entities for a subject and an object are metabolic reactions . For ex - ample , the testicular 17 - beta - hydroxysteroid dehydrogen - ase is defined with ‘ Estrone + H + NADPH < = > Estradiol + NADP ’ [ 21 ] . Here , the subject of this KU becomes ‘ CIDs00005870 ’ , ‘ CIDs00001038 ’ and ‘ CIDs22833512 ’ whereas the object becomes ‘ CIDs00005757 ’ and ‘ CIDs00005886 ’ ( Additional file 1 : Figure S10 ) . Previous models often use non - standardized terms to indicate the relationships of biological events , which may result in several different terms with the same meaning . For example , two differently written terms , ‘ up - regulate ’ and ‘ express ’ ultimately mean the same bio - logical relationship . An original term of a predicate from a reference model ( e . g . , up - regulate or express ) is denoted for the ‘ predicate in the reference ’ in additional information . On the other hand , the predicate in a triple is represented by one of 11 controlled vocabularies that are pre - defined depending on the resolution of the direction and sign : directed link , induction , reduction , activation by increase , activation by decrease , inhibition by increase , inhibition by decrease , undirected link , posi - tive correlation , negative correlation and missing inter - action . The relations between the 11 controlled terms are depicted in Fig . 2 . Lower - level terms ( e . g . , activation / inhibition by increase / decrease , positive / negative correl - ation ) provide higher - resolution information than the other higher - level terms ( e . g . , directed link , undirected link ) . Unlike ‘ undirected link ’ , the ‘ directed link ’ refers to a relationship with known causality from the subject to the object . The ‘ activation / inhibition by increase / de - crease ’ represents a relationship in which the increased / decreased regulation or activity of subject results in the activated / inhibited regulation or activity of object . The ‘ directed link ’ can be used for the predicate of a KU whose causality is known , but the detailed sign is not confirmed . In such cases that a biological event existing in a normal condition is observed to disappear under a certain environmental context such as a disease condi - tion , predicate of this KU can be a ‘ missing interaction ’ . The ‘ predicate in the reference ’ for ‘ activation by increase ’ possibly would have the following words : ‘ acti - vate ’ , ‘ express ’ , ‘ positively regulate ’ or ‘ increase ’ . The additional information of a triple in a KU includes the following components : environmental contexts ( explained above ) , the predicate in the reference ( explained above ) , species , reference , and evidence score . First , each KU has a species which the corresponding biological events are observed from ( e . g . , Homo sapiens or mouse ) . Second , the ‘ reference ’ describes detailed in - formation of the reference models which the KUs come from . Here , a reference consists of the following multiple elements : reference type , name , description , record id , version , and acquisition date . The ‘ reference type ’ indi - cates a type of a reference model ( e . g . , database , Kwon et al . BMC Bioinformatics 2019 , 20 ( Suppl 10 ) : 248 Page 49 of 80 literature , or wet experiment ) . The ‘ name ’ refers to the exact name of a reference model ( e . g . , BioGrid , KEGG pathway , PubMed , or in vitro ) . The ‘ description ’ contains a plaintext explanation for the reference model ( e . g . , ‘ a manually curated database ’ or ‘ yeast - two hybrid ’ ) or the corresponding sentence of the referred article in the case of a literature type . The ‘ record id ’ refers to an URL link that detailed information of the KU is available ( e . g . ‘ https : / / www . genome . jp / dbget - bin / www _ bget ? hsa00010 ’ for a KU from ‘ KEGG pathway ’ model ) . The ‘ version ’ refers to the version or updated date of the databases , the published date of the literature , or an experiment - carried out date . Lastly , the ‘ acquisition date ’ refers to a date when a biological event from a reference model is converted into KU in the CODA - ML format . For example , a KU is defined based on a biological event from the hsa05224 of the KEGG pathway [ 4 ] , which is , a database containing manually curated data that was lastly updated in 2017 . Its reference has the following elements and values : ‘ reference type ’ - ‘ database ’ , ‘ name ’ - ‘ - KEGG ’ , ‘ description ’ - ‘ manually curated data ’ , ‘ record id ’ - ‘ http : / / www . genome . jp / kegg - bin / show _ pathway ? hsa05224 ’ , ‘ version ’ - ‘ 2017 ’ , ‘ acquisition date ’ - ‘ 2018 ’ ( Additional file 1 : Figure S9 ) . Last , to support the reliabil - ity , each KU can have an ‘ evidence score ’ which is either a discrete or continuous value based on given information from the reference model ( e . g . , p - value ) . Results The CODA - ML was defined to precisely represent essential biological information of biological events , es - pecially molecular specifications and biological contexts whose representation was limited by other language for - mats . For molecular specifications , molecule type , iso - form , and modifications are included . For biological contexts , anatomical contexts and environmental con - texts are covered . Thus , the CODA - ML can distinguish different isoforms and molecules with or without modifi - cations , differentiate biological events under different ana - tomical or environmental context , and cover inter - cellular events as well as intra - cellular events ( Table 1 ) . To evaluate the utility of the CODA - ML format and make a user guide for this , three different examples are introduced . The first example is part of the RTK signal - ing pathway , involving the MAPK / ERK and PI3K / AKT pathways , which induce two cancer - related cell func - tions ; proteasomal degradation and G1 / S transition [ 22 ] . The RTK signaling pathways include diverse kinases such as MEK and ERK that phosphorylate other pro - teins . Thus , molecular specification , particularly molecu - lar modifications , are important to precisely represent this pathway . Illustrations of this pathway considering molecular specifications are depicted in Fig . 3a . The second example is the mechanism of the actions of cisplatin and gemcitabine [ 23 ] . Two CASP9 - encoded protein isoforms , CASP9a and CASP9b , have different effects on apoptosis . CASP9a induces apoptosis whereas CASP9b inhibits this . To promote apoptosis , cisplatin increases the amount of CASP9a , and gemcitabine decreases the activity of CASP9b ( Fig . 3b ) . Because drugs may target different isoforms , mechanisms of drug actions can be elucidated in more detail by using mo - lecular isoforms . The last example is the mechanism of genistein ac - tions for hypertension inferred by a previous model [ 24 ] . According to the inference , genistein binds to the FGF1 protein in fibroblasts of the skin ; the FGF1 protein acti - vates the FGFR1 protein in the muscle cells of the heart ; FGFR1 protein activates the UBC protein ; the UBC pro - tein activates the CTGF protein , and CTGF affects hypertension ( Fig . 3c ) . Because mechanisms of drug actions can be related to inter - cellular biological events , to represent the anatomical contexts for each of subject and object helps to better elucidate drug mechanisms . Fig . 2 Hierarchical relations between 11 controlled predicate terms . It shows hierarchical relations between 11 exclusive terms that are pre - defined depending on the resolution of direction and sign . Based on the causality of subject and object in a knowledge unit ( KU ) , the predicate of the KU becomes either of ‘ undirected link ’ or ‘ directed link ’ . Furthermore , if the more detailed information for the sign is available , the KU can have higher - resolution terms such as ‘ positive increase ’ . In such cases that a biological event existing in normal condition is observed to disappear under certain conditions such as a disease , the predicate of this KU can be ‘ missing interaction ’ Kwon et al . BMC Bioinformatics 2019 , 20 ( Suppl 10 ) : 248 Page 50 of 80 These three examples models in the CODA - ML format can be accessed via http : / / github . com / MijinKwon / CODA - ML . For the interoperability and interchangeability of the CODA - ML with the most representative formats previ - ously introduced ( i . e . , SBML , BioPax , and BEL ) , we pro - vide a conversion module . There are modules that convert language formats from BioPax to SBML or BEL and vice versa [ 21 , 25 ] , thus we provide a new module that can convert language formats between CODA - ML and BioPax . The corresponding codes are also available at : http : / / github . com / MijinKwon / CODA - ML . Discussion / conclusion We defined an XML - based language format called the CODA - ML that effectively represents the essential infor - mation of biological events and fosters interoperability and exchangeability among different models with hetero - geneous formats . Among the several essential biological information , the major focuses of this work were mo - lecular specifications ( i . e . molecule type , isoform , and modifications ) and biological contexts ( i . e . anatomical contexts and environmental contexts ) . The two informa - tion is very necessary for biological events but previous formats had limited ability to represent them . Using molecular specifications , the CODA - ML discriminates genes , transcripts , and proteins with or without modifi - cations , and thus , it facilitates the detailed elucidation of mechanism pathways . The usefulness of molecular specification was proved by example models of RTK sig - naling pathway and mechanisms of actions of cisplatin and gemcitabine . In addition , the CODA - ML designates anatomical contexts for each of subject and object in the format of hierarchical organization . Thus , it can represent inter - anatomical events as well as intra - anatomical events , enabling a comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms of complex diseases or drug actions that are involved in multiple organs . The utility of designating anatomical contexts per entity was proved by mechanisms of action of genistein which is used for hypertension , one of the most representative diseases . Furthermore , consideration Fig . 3 Three example models in the CODA - ML format . To evaluate the utility of the CODA - ML format , three different examples are introduced . a The RTK signaling pathway includes the MAPK / ERK and PI3K / AKT signaling pathways linked to two cancer - related functions . Many molecules in this pathway have molecular modifications or are protein complexes , which requires molecular representation in detail . b Different isoforms originated from the same gene may have different effects to the same function . The mechanisms of the actions of cisplatin and gemcitabine show that drugs may target different isoforms , which highlights that molecular isoforms are essential for precise representation of mechanisms of drug actions . c The mechanism of genistein actions for hypertension was inferred by a previous model in a computational way . This mechanism shows that mechanisms of drug actions particularly , for complex diseases , may involve inter - anatomical relationships as well as intra - anatomy relationships Kwon et al . BMC Bioinformatics 2019 , 20 ( Suppl 10 ) : 248 Page 51 of 80 of environmental contexts , which have not been appreci - ated by previously introduced standard formats , enables the distinction of associations that are differently observed depending on the conditions such as disease status or drug treatment . As shown in the three exam - ples , the consideration of molecular specifications and biological contexts could help more precise representa - tion of biological events . These results demonstrate that the CODA - ML outperforms than previous language formats in unifying biological events with detailed bio - logical information . The CODA - ML is expected to be a great help to the effective integration of different individual models and comprehensive analysis of com - plex diseases . Although we put forth many efforts to propose a new standard format to effectively represent biological events , there could be some unresolved issues . First , while the CODA - ML can standardize complicated but essential biological information of biological events , some other important information ( e . g . , gene sequence ) was not covered for user convenience and simplicity of the representation , possibly restricting the performance of models for very high - resolution analyses . Second , from an opposite perspective , essential information that the CODA - ML requires may often be unavailable , restricting the utility of this format . Because the CODA - ML is of the XML - based extendable format , it can be freely modified at the user ’ s discretion if needed .
