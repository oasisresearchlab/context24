The rise in COVID - 19 cases due to the Delta variant coincided 19 with a return to in - person school attendance , straining COVID - 19 mitigation plans implemented by 20 educational institutions . Some plans required sick students to self - isolate off - campus , resulting in an 21 unintended consequence : exposure of co - inhabitants of dwellings used by the sick person during 22 isolation . We assessed air and surface samples collected from the bedroom of a self - isolating university 23 student with mild COVID - 19 for the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 . That virus’ RNA was detected by real - time 24 reverse - transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( rRT - qPCR ) in air samples from both an 25 isolation bedroom and a distal , non - isolation room of the same dwelling . SARS - CoV - 2 was detected and 26 viable virus was isolated in cell cultures from aerosol samples as well as from the surface of a mobile 27 phone . Genomic sequencing revealed that the virus was a Delta variant SARS - CoV - 2 strain . Taken 28 together , the results of this work confirm the presence of viable SARS - CoV - 2 within a residential living 29 space of a person with COVID - 19 and show potential for transportation of virus - laden aerosols beyond a 30 designated isolation suite to other areas of a single - family home . 31 32 Keywords : rRT - qPCR ; air sampling ; virus culture ; infectious 33 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 1 . INTRODUCTION 34 The coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 35 coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) has resulted in over 6 . 2 million deaths and over 503 million known cases 36 worldwide through April 19 , 2022 ( WHO , 2022 ) . The pandemic has strained medical resources in the US 37 ( Blumenthal et al . , 2021 ; French et al . , 2021 ; Parsons Leigh et al . , 2021 ) and elsewhere ( Bastos et al . , 38 2021 ; Hallal & Victora , 2021 ) and has transformed public interactions by altering the frequency at and 39 mechanisms by which people communicate and socialize ( Philpot et al . , 2021 ) . In December of 2020 , 40 administration of vaccines against SARS - CoV - 2 were initiated at a limited scale within healthcare settings 41 and subsequently broadened with an increase of vaccine supplies . It has been estimated that 66 % of the 42 global population has received at least one dose of a vaccination series and that the rate stands at 77 % 43 within the US as of April 19 , 2022 ( Holder , 2022 ) . Injected COVID - 19 vaccines have provided protection 44 against severe disease and have reduced the hospitalization and death rates of those vaccinated relative 45 to those unvaccinated ( Scobie et al . , 2021 ; Tenforde et al . , 2021 ) . However , breakthrough events have 46 demonstrated that vaccine protection is imperfect ( Brown et al . , 2021 ; Chau et al . , 2021 ; Klompas , 2021 ) 47 and studies have shown that protection against SARS - CoV - 2 wanes after 6 or so months past vaccine 48 series completion ( Levine - Tiefenbrun et al . , 2021 ; Thomas et al . , 2021 ) . This circumstance may correlate 49 with the previous predominance of the Delta variant of SARS - CoV - 2 ( Pango genetic lineage B . 1 . 617 . 2 ) , 50 which as of the week ending on November 20 , 2021 , accounted for 99 . 9 % of genotyped SARS - CoV - 2 51 infections within the U . S . ( CDC , 2021d ) . The Delta variant carries spike protein substitutions at T19R , 52 V70F , T95I , G142D , E156del , F157del , R158G , A222V , W258L , K417N , L452R , T478K , D614G , P681R , 53 D950N , and has been linked to increased transmissibility of the virus , reduced effectiveness of vaccine - 54 induced neutralizing antibodies , and reduced neutralization by some monoclonal antibody treatments 55 ( CDC , 2021c ) . Chia et al . ( 2021 ) showed decreased duration and severity of illness for symptomatic 56 vaccinated persons compared to symptomatic unvaccinated persons infected with Delta variant SARS - 57 CoV - 2 , but their assessment showed similar levels of viral load in both vaccinated and unvaccinated 58 patients , indicating potential for similar post - vaccination transmission potential , despite the beneficial self - 59 protective impact . Li et al . ( 2021 ) reported that a Delta variant outbreak resulted in an average decrease 60 in time from exposure to positive rRT - qPCR test of two days and an average increase in viral loads 61 determined by rRT - qPCR of 1260 times beyond values seen during 2020 . Relative to the original SARS - 62 CoV - 2 strains , there have been increased risks of hospitalization , ICU admission , and death among 63 COVID - 19 patients infected with the Delta variant , and increased risk as well within those categories 64 compared to earlier variants ( Fisman & Tuite , 2021 ) . Similarly , Allen et al . ( 2021 ) found that the odds of 65 household transmission increased by 70 % when the emitting source was infected with the Delta variant of 66 SARS - CoV - 2 compared to the Alpha variant . 67 The stability of SARS - CoV - 2 on environmental surfaces and in the air has been explored , revealing 68 that the virus can persist for hours to days outside of a human host ( Fears et al . , 2020 ; Kasloff et al . , 69 2021 ; Liu et al . , 2021 ; Pastorino et al . , 2020 ; van Doremalen et al . , 2020 ) . According to the CDC , the 70 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 main route of transmission occurs through inhalation of virus - laden particles ( CDC , 2021b ) . However , 71 that route of transmission has been challenging to study largely because the collection of airborne SARS - 72 CoV - 2 particles is technically difficult , as it is for other viruses ( Coleman et al . , 2021 ; Lednicky , et al . , 73 2020 ; Nannu Shankar et al . , 2022 ; Pan et al . , 2019 ) . 74 Despite uncertainty regarding the transmissibility of SARS - CoV - 2 variants and the severity of the 75 illnesses they cause , the widespread availability of vaccines in the US has driven the evolution of public 76 health policies away from the prevention of infections by SARS - CoV - 2 and toward less - restrictive pre - 77 pandemic guidelines . As policymakers weigh how to combat the COVID - 19 pandemic , knowledge and 78 beliefs about the severity of illness caused by SARS - CoV - 2 variants , and their transmissibility , have 79 influenced decisions by administrators amid fluctuating community case rates . Those decisions have 80 resulted in a patchwork of procedures across the US , particularly within schools during the autumn 81 semester of 2021 ( California Department of Public Health , 2021 ; Texas Education Agency , 2021 ) . At the 82 collegiate level , policies enacted at some institutions contained requirements for students with positive 83 SARS - CoV - 2 test results to isolate off - campus when on - campus isolation space was unavailable . That 84 guidance created subsequent challenges when students normally living on - campus had to move off - 85 campus to self - isolate : ( a ) While relocating , infectious individuals can expose others in cars , buses , or 86 other forms of transportation , and ( b ) During self - isolation , those individuals might expose others who live 87 in the same dwelling to infectious virus . Ultimately , policies requiring relocation for self - isolation may 88 facilitate the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 to populations which otherwise would not have interacted with those 89 infected individuals . 90 Analyses of epidemiological outbreak data ( Qian et al . , 2020 ) and targeted sampling of quarantined 91 households to determine secondary infection rates ( Grijalva et al . , 2020 ) have shown that transmission of 92 SARS - CoV - 2 within homes is high and results in more than three times more secondary infections than 93 occurs in other types of venues . Those analyses add to the mounting body of evidence that time spent in 94 residential environments is positively correlated with an increasing likelihood of virus transmission by 95 infectious individuals to others within the residence . SARS - CoV - 2 RNA has been detected on residential 96 surface samples by rRT - qPCR ( Döhla et al . , 2020 ; Maestre et al . , 2021 ; Nannu Shankar et al . , 2022 ) . 97 Similarly , the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 in aerosols collected at distances of ~ 0 . 3 - 2 . 2 m from sick persons 98 within residential isolation rooms was reported by Nannu Shankar et al . ( 2022 ) . However , SARS - CoV - 2 99 could not be isolated in cell cultures during that aerosol study for various reasons , including out - 100 competition by a faster - growing human adenovirus B that was a co - infecting pathogen in one of the 101 people afflicted with COVID - 19 , and thus it was not possible to infer that infectious virus was present in 102 the environmental samples . Though it was not successfully isolated , the study nevertheless was 103 informative regarding the distribution of airborne particle associated with the transport of SARS - CoV - 2 as 104 a three - stage National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) bioaerosol sampler ( Model 105 BC - 251 ) with dual cyclone stages and a final filter stage allowed aerosol particle size fractionation ( Cao et 106 al . , 2010 ) , revealing that SARS - CoV - 2 was primarily within particles with average diameters < 4 . 4 µm 107 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 ( Nannu Shankar et al . , 2022 ) . That finding is significant because particles < about 4 µm can travel 108 deeper into the lungs , creating potential for greater risk of infection of the cells of the lower respiratory 109 tract , leading to pneumonia ( Pan et al . , 2019 ) . Whereas cyclones and filters can inactivate viruses during 110 the collection process , resulting in difficulties isolating them in cell cultures , condensation growth tube 111 ( CGT ) air samplers can collect airborne viruses in a manner that maintains their viability ( “infectivity” ) 112 ( Lednicky , et al . , 2020 ) , but those CGTs do not size - fractionate particle sizes . It is important to determine 113 ( a ) the dimension of airborne particles that contain virions , and ( b ) whether the virions within the airborne 114 particles are viable for proper inhalation risk assessments . As mentioned above , particles < 4 µm in 115 diameter can travel to the lower lungs , and only viable virus particles can cause disease . Therefore , 116 multiple air sampler types were used in our investigation , both to improve the chances of maintaining 117 virus viability during the collection process and to discern the distribution of particle sizes containing 118 SARS - CoV - 2 . 119 In this opportunistic investigation , we sought to assess the potential for SARS - CoV - 2 exposure in a 120 residential setting . Environmental sampling occurred after a volunteer college student relocated to an off - 121 campus self - isolation site in accordance with a policy requiring self - isolation away from campus after a 122 positive SARS - CoV - 2 test result . 123 124 2 . MATERIALS AND METHODS 125 This work was IRB exempt as it did not involve human clinical trials or the collection of information 126 that could reveal the identity of the volunteer . 127 128 2 . 1 . Student volunteer and sampling site 129 A 19 - year - old college student , non - vaccinated against COVID - 19 and living in on - campus 130 apartment - style housing , began experiencing symptoms of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in the evening of 131 August 31 , 2021 . A nasopharyngeal ( NP ) specimen was collected the following morning at a campus 132 clinic and submitted for diagnostic rRT - qPCR tests , and the results of the rRT - qPCR tests were made 133 available later the same day , confirming the student harbored a SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Thereafter , the 134 student departed the school dormitory in the afternoon on September 01 , 2021 and drove along with a 135 parent over 570 miles ( 917 km ) to a single - family home of a family friend for self - isolation . Relocation 136 concluded early on September 02 , 2021 , and samplings took place the following day ( approximately three 137 days after onset of the student’s COVID - 19 symptoms ) . The student’s self - reported symptoms were body 138 aches , congestion , fatigue , and a mild cough . The volunteer remained symptomatic during environmental 139 samplings but noted their symptoms began abating September 02 , 2021 . The student and homeowner 140 conveyed information about this situation by telephone during the relocation , and both consented to have 141 environmental samples collected within the isolation suite and elsewhere in the home . 142 The test site consisted of an en suite bedroom ( 3 . 8 m x 3 . 7 m ) , connected to the main body of a 143 single - family home through a short hallway . The doorway linking the isolation suite to the rest of the 144 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 home remained closed throughout the isolation period and during all samplings . Air flow from the 145 residential air conditioning unit was intermittent , and room temperatures ranged from 25 . 9 to 27 . 1 ° C . 146 Samples were collected both within the isolation suite and in the main body of the home . Sampling 147 locations outside of the isolation suite were selected to investigate potential virus transport through the air 148 handling system shared with the isolation suite . The sampling region , sample points , heating , ventilation , 149 and air conditioning ( HVAC ) supply outlets , and HVAC return inlets near the sampling points are shown in 150 Figure 1 . 151 152 2 . 2 . Air samplers 153 A BioSpot Viable Virus Aerosol Sampler ( BioSpot - VIVAS ) ( Model 300 , Aerosol Devices Inc , US ) 154 and two NIOSH bioaerosol samplers ( Model BC - 251 ) were used to perform air samplings . 155 The BioSpot - VIVAS operates on the same principle as the Viable Virus Aerosol Sampler ( VIVAS ) 156 ( Lednicky et al . , 2016 ; Pan et al . , 2017 ) . Briefly , airborne particles enter the BioSpot - VIVAS through the 157 inlet port on the top of the device . The device diverts that single inlet airstream into eight parallel 158 condensation growth tubes . Particles collect water on their surfaces and enlarge as they move downward 159 within the tubes , gently impacting into 1 . 5 mL of liquid collection medium within a 35 mm x 10 mm petri 160 dish ( catalog no . 150318 , ThermoFisher Scientific , US ) . 161 The BC - 251 has been described previously ( Cao et al . , 2010 ; Lindsley et al . , 2006 ; Nannu Shankar 162 et al . , 2022 ) . Briefly , BC - 251 consists of three stages , a first - stage cyclone with 15 mL tube ( Falcon 163 conical centrifuge tubes , catalog no . 14 - 959 - 53A , Fisher Scientific , US ) , a second - stage cyclone with 1 . 5 164 mL Eppendorf tube ( Microcentrifuge tubes , Fisher scientific , catalog no . 02 - 681 - 373 ) and a third - stage 165 polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) filter ( 37 mm , 2 μm pore , catalog no . 225 – 1709 , SKC Inc . , US ) . The air 166 inlet port on the BC - 251 is situated on the front face of the sampler housing . 167 Further description of the air samplers is included in the supplementary material section of this 168 manuscript . 169 170 2 . 3 Dual - function liquid collection medium 171 We produced the liquid collection medium that was used in the air samplers and that also served 172 as the virus transport medium ( VTM ) for swab samples . It contained sucrose that functioned as a 173 cryopreservation agent , brain - heart infusion ( BHI ) broth and bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) Fraction V as 174 sources of proteins to help stabilize SARS - CoV - 2 virions , and its formula is given in this manuscript’s 175 supplementary material section . Following verification that the VTM was sterile , a little more than 1 . 5 mL 176 of VTM was aseptically transferred from stock supply into sterile 15 mL conical polypropylene centrifuge 177 tubes ( Falcon brand , catalog no . 14 - 959 - 53A , Fisher Scientific , US ) within a biosafety cabinet ( BSC ) . At 178 the testing site , 1 . 5 mL of VTM from those tubes was transferred into the BioSpot - VIVAS’ petri dishes to 179 serve as sample collection media . 15 mL centrifuge tubes containing 1 . 5 mL of VTM for immersion and 180 transport of surface swab samples were prepared in the same manner . 181 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 182 2 . 4 Preparation of BC - 251 samplers 183 The filters and centrifuge tubes mentioned in section 2 . 2 above served as collection tubes in the 184 BC - 251 samplers and were installed into the sampler housing within a BSC in a BSL2 laboratory . The 185 two BC - 251 samplers with connected filter and tube stages were then inserted into inside plastic bags 186 and sealed with tape for transport to the testing sites . 187 188 2 . 5 Collection of air samples 189 Air samplers were set at fixed points in rooms with sampling inlets ~ 1 . 5 m from the ground , a 190 height that approximates the distance from the ground to the nose of the most likely seated ( bedside 191 chair ) and supine ( bed ) positions of the volunteer . Air sampling with a BC - 251 and a BioSpot - VIVAS 192 occurred on September 03 , 2021 ( Day 3 following onset of symptoms ) . The BioSpot - VIVAS was 193 positioned 3 m from the center of the bed headboard , and it was elevated by placing it atop a television 194 stand . The BC - 251 was situated on a dresser near the bedroom entry , 2 . 5 m from the center of the bed 195 headboard . Inlet heights and distances of the air samplers were selected to focus sampling on virions 196 transported in aerosols , rather than those in large particles settling out of the air close to the individual . 197 BC - 251 samplers were connected to Airchek sampler pumps ( Model 224 - PCXR4 , SKC Inc . , US ) 198 and operated at 3 LPM for three hours for two samplings . Likewise , the BioSpot - VIVAS was operated for 199 three hours at 8 LPM for two samplings . Swab samples were collected after the start of the air sampler 200 run times and were immersed in 1 . 5 mL of VTM within centrifuge tubes . After the completion of each 201 sampling , the BC - 251 sampler was placed into a polypropylene bag with tube and filter stages still 202 attached , and the bag was folded shut and sealed with tape . Each petri dish from the BioSpot - VIVAS 203 was sealed with parafilm ( Fisher Scientific catalog no . 13 - 374 - 12 , Bemis Company Inc , US ) and placed 204 into an empty pipet tip box ( SureOne™ Aerosol Barrier Pipette Tips , catalog no . 02 - 707 - 404 , Fisher 205 Scientific , US ) for transportation . All samples were stored in a cooler containing dry ice , to freeze the 206 samples in - transit to help retain virus viability during the three - hour return drive . Samples were stored in 207 a - 80 °C freezer at UF until rRT - qPCR and virology analyses were completed later . 208 209 2 . 6 Surface sampling 210 Surfaces of frequently touched items reported by the volunteer and assessed by the research 211 team were swabbed with sterile nylon swabs ( Nasal Flocked Swab , part no . 96000 , Miraclean 212 Technology Co , Ltd . , China ) . The surfaces chosen for sampling were a mobile phone ( ~ 80 cm 2 ) , laptop 213 computer touch pad ( ~ 60 cm 2 ) , toilet handle ( ~ 20 cm 2 ) , chair arm ( ~ 230 cm 2 ) , entry way floor ( ~ 230 cm 2 ) , 214 and a food container’s lid handle ( ~ 80 cm 2 ) . Outside of the room , two additional surfaces were swabbed 215 to assess whether SARS - CoV - 2 was transported elsewhere in the home and deposited on those surfaces 216 ( Figure 1 ) . Those samples were taken at a table ( ~ 230 cm 2 ) and a second bedroom desk ( ~ 230 cm 2 ) . A 217 6 in . × 6 in . ( 15 . 2 cm × 15 . 2 cm ) template , precut from an 8 . 5 in . × 11 in . sheet of laminated paper , was 218 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 used to collect samples from surfaces large enough to accommodate it . Surfaces with sampling areas 219 smaller than the template were measured on - site using a LASER measure ( GLM165 - 40 , Robert Bosch 220 GmbH , Gerlingen , Germany ) . Surface samples were collected by swabbing in two directions over the 221 sampling surface , with the direction of the second pass perpendicular to the first . 222 223 2 . 7 Personal protective equipment for air sampling 224 Nitrile gloves ( manufacturer number 52818 , Kimberly - Clark , Irving , TX , US ) and an N95 mask 225 ( Model 1870 + , 3M , Saint Paul , MN , US ) were worn while operating and manipulating devices and 226 samples . Gloves were changed between uses and were disposed as biohazard waste . Interactions with 227 the volunteer were minimized and direct contact was avoided . The outer surfaces of all equipment used 228 within the volunteer’s room during the sampling event were disinfected with 70 % ethanol following the 229 packaging of the collected samples . 230 231 2 . 8 Sample processing 232 Samples were initially processed in a BSL - 2 + laboratory . In work performed in a BSC , 1 . 5 mL 233 and 0 . 5 mL of VTM were added to the stage 1 and stage 2 tubes of the BC - 251 samplers , respectively , 234 after the tubes were removed from the sampler housing , and the tubes were set aside at room 235 temperature for 30 minutes to allow material captured on the inside surfaces of the tubes to rehydrate . 236 The third - stage filter was immersed in 5 mL of VTM in a 50 mL tube and set aside at room temperature 237 for 30 minutes to allow material captured on the filter to rehydrate . Third - stage filters and their immersion 238 fluids were then transferred into a sterile 100 × 15 mm plastic petri dish ( Fisher Scientific , Cat . No . 239 S33580A ) , and matter still trapped on the filters was scraped off with flocked nylon swabs ( Copan 240 Diagnostics , Inc . , Murrieta , CA , US ) pre - wetted with VTM , as it had been used as the recovery solution . 241 The process used for recovering virus from the third - stage filter was based on side - by - side tests 242 performed with laboratory - generated aerosols on the recovery of enveloped virus on PTFE filters 243 ( Lednicky & Loeb , 2013 ; Lednicky , unpublished results ) . Enhanced recovery of enveloped viruses 244 ( influenza A , human coronavirus OC43 , and respiratory syncytial virus A ) was observed when filters were 245 pre - soaked and then scraped , and this because both PTFE and the enveloped viruses that were tested 246 are hydrophobic ; scraping may thus assist in dislodging the virus off the filter surface . Swabs were twirled 247 against the inner surface of the petri dish to extrude the material collected by the swabs into the recovery 248 solution . All fluids were concentrated by centrifugation in Amicon Ultra - 15 centrifugal filter units with 249 Ultracel - 100 membranes that had a molecular mass cutoff of 100 kDa ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) at 4000×g 250 for 12 min . The concentrates were thereafter adjusted to 400 μL by addition of VTM , then aseptically 251 transferred to sterile plastic cryotubes with silicone gaskets ( Fisher Scientific , cat . No . 10 - 500 - 26 ) , and 252 the tubes transported in a Styrofoam container with ice packs to a BSL2 - enhanced laboratory at the UF 253 Emerging Pathogens Institute , where they were stored in a locked - 80 ° C freezer until further analysis . 254 255 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 2 . 9 Real - time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( rRT - qPCR ) 256 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention N2 gene target ( CDC , 2020 ) was used for 257 SARS - CoV - 2 detection and quantification by rRT - qPCR , as previously detailed ( Rainey et al . , 2022 ) . The 258 quantity of SARS - CoV - 2 genomes per sample was extrapolated based on an 8 - point standard curve of 259 1 : 5 dilutions ranging from 100 , 000 to 1 . 28 CDC N2 genomic copies / μL as detailed in Rainey et al . ( 2022 ) . 260 261 2 . 10 Cell lines for SARS - CoV - 2 isolation 262 Two cell lines obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) were used for SARS - 263 CoV - 2 isolation attempts : LLC - MK2 ( Rhesus monkey kidney cells , catalog no . ATCC CCL - 7 ) , and Vero 264 E6 cells ( African green monkey kidney cells , catalog no . ATCC CRL - 1586 ) ( Lednicky , et al . , 2020 ) . The 265 cells were propagated in cell culture medium comprised of aDMEM ( advanced Dulbecco’s modified 266 essential medium , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) supplemented with 10 % low antibody , heat - inactivated , 267 gamma - irradiated fetal bovine serum ( FBS , Hyclone , GE Healthcare Life Sciences , Pittsburgh , PA ) , L - 268 alanine , L - glutamine dipeptide supplement ( GlutaMAX , Invitrogen ) , and 50 μg / mL penicillin , 50 μg / mL 269 streptomycin , 100 μg / mL neomycin ( PSN antibiotics , Invitrogen ) with incubation at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 . 270 271 2 . 11 SARS - CoV - 2 isolation and plaque assays 272 All work on SARS - CoV - 2 was performed in a BSL3 laboratory by a trained analyst who wore 273 appropriate personal protection equipment that included a chemically impervious Tyvek suit , gloves , and 274 used a full - head covering powered - air purifying respirator . 275 276 2 . 11 . 1 SARS - CoV - 2 isolation in cultured cells 277 LLC - MK2 and Vero E6 cells grown as monolayers in a T - 25 flask ( growing surface 25 cm 2 ) were 278 inoculated when they were at 80 % confluency ( Lednicky , et al . , 2020 ) . Briefly , 60 μL aliquots of the 279 concentrated air sampler collection media were filtered through sterile 0 . 45 - μm pore size PVDV syringe - 280 tip filters to remove bacterial and fungal cells and spores . Next , the spent cell culture medium was 281 removed from each flask and replaced with 1 mL of cell culture medium , and the cells thereafter 282 inoculated with 50 μL of filtrate . When virus - induced cytopathic effects ( CPE ) were evident 283 ( approximately 4 days post - inoculation ) , the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 was determined by rRT - qPCR . 284 285 2 . 11 . 2 SARS - CoV - 2 plaque assays 286 Plaque assays were performed in Vero E6 cells ( essentially as described in Ragan et al . ( 2020 ) . 287 Briefly , newly confluent Vero E6 cells in 6 - well tissue culture plates were inoculated with 0 . 2 mL of 10 - fold 288 serial dilutions of the complete cell growth medium , and the virus allowed to bind to the cells for 1 hr . at 289 37 °C , with rocking of the plates performed manually every 15 min . After virus adsorption , the cells were 290 washed with serum - free DMEM and the wells subsequently overlaid with 3 mL / well of primary overlay 291 consisting of 1 . 6 % w / v agarose ( Invitrogen Corp . ) mixed 1 : 1 with 2X EMEM ( Lonza , Walkersville , MD ) 292 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 containing antibiotics , sodium pyruvate , Glutamax , antibiotics , and 10 % FBS . After they had solidified , 293 the plates were inverted and incubated for 3 days , then overlaid with 2 mL of secondary overlay at day 5 294 post - infection . The cells were fixed with 10 % buffered formalin , followed by the removal of the overlay , 295 and then stained with 0 . 2 % crystal violet to visualize plaques . 296 297 2 . 12 Sequencing of virus genomes 298 Sanger sequencing based on a gene - walking approach with tiled primers was attempted for 299 three samples ( A , B , and C ) to obtain the consensus virus sequence , as described in Lednicky et al . 300 ( 2020 ) and Rainey et al . ( 2022 ) . 301 302 3 . RESULTS 303 SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was detected by rRT - qPCR in nucleic acids extracted and purified from one 304 surface swab sample and five air samples .

The concentrations of viable 322 virus were 132 and 292 PFU / L of air . No viable virus was isolated from material collected using the 323 NIOSH samplers . 324 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 A complete consensus SARS - CoV - 2 genomic sequence was obtained for all three virus isolates , and 325 the sequences were identical . The genomic sequence was deposited in GenBank as SARS - CoV - 326 2 / Environment / USA / UF - 41 / 2021 , under GenBank accession number OL622105 . 1 . The nucleotide 327 sequence of this virus matches ( perfectly ) SARS - CoV - 2 / human / USA / TN - CDC - STM - 000723021 / 2021 , 328 which was collected August 17 , 2021 ( GenBank accession number OL536032 ) , whereas our samples 329 were collected September 3 , 2021 , suggesting possible introduction of the virus by a visitor from the state 330 of Tennessee . Compared to those of the reference strain of SARS - CoV - 2 , the deduced amino acid 331 sequences of the virus proteins of our isolate contain the following amino acid substitutions : Spike ( T19R , 332 G142D , 156G , F157del , R158del , L452R , T478K , I598V , D614G , P681R , D950N , T95I , I1232S ) , M 333 ( I82T ) , N ( D63G , R203M , G215C , D377Y ) , NS3 ( S26L ) , NS7a ( V82A , T120I ) , NS7b ( T40I ) , NSP3 ( A488S , 334 H563Y , P1228L , P1469S ) , NSP4 ( V167L , T492I ) , NSP6 ( L37F , T77A ) , NSP12 ( P323L , L372I , G671S ) , 335 NSP13 ( P77L , A296S ) , NSP14 ( A394V ) . The virus sequence places it in GISAID clade GK , and in Pango 336 Lineage : B . 1 . 617 . 2 ( Pango v . 3 . 1 . 16 2021 - 11 - 18 ) , Delta ( B . 1 . 617 . 2 - like ) ( Scorpio ) . It is thus a SARS - 337 CoV - 2 variant of concern ( VOC ) of the type GK / 478K . V1 ( B . 1 . 617 . 2 + AY . x ) that was first detected in India . 338 339 4 . DISCUSSION 340 The CDC announced that SARS - CoV - 2 can be transmitted by aerosols through inhalation ( CDC , 341 2021b ) , and public health reliance on six - feet physical distancing zones as a primary prevention method 342 has lessened with growing knowledge of how virus spreads person - to - person . Yet , references to the 343 original six - feet physical distancing zone persist in some public health guidelines ( CDC , 2021a , 2022 ) , a 344 distance which does not negate exposure risk due to transmission by aerosols . Transport of viable 345 SARS - CoV - 2 in aerosols was reported in a hospital ( Lednicky et al . , 2020 ) and demonstrated under 346 laboratory conditions ( Hawks et al . , 2021 ; Schuit et al . , 2021 ) . Other attempts to collect virus in air 347 samples and isolate the virus in cell cultures have been made in residential settings , wherein virus was 348 either not collected ( Döhla et al . , 2020 ) or not isolated in cell cultures from material containing SARS - 349 CoV - 2 RNA , indicating that the virus either was truly not viable or had been inactivated through the 350 collection process ( Lednicky et al . , 2021 ; Nannu Shankar et al . , 2022 ; Santarpia et al . , 2020 ) . Our results 351 show that viable SARS - CoV - 2 virions can be transported by air currents to distances relatively far away 352 from an emitting source ( i . e . , a person with an active COVID - 19 respiratory tract infection ) . With sampler 353 locations beyond a six - feet physical distancing protection zone ( CDC , 2022 ) , our work indicates that , as 354 with other SARS - CoV - 2 variants , the Delta variant can also be present in aerosols . 355 Of particular interest was the detection of SARS - CoV - 2 in an area of the home far separated from the 356 isolation suite . It is well known that human activities within a residence can impact particle concentrations 357 in the immediate area and within other rooms within the residence ( Balasubramanian & Sheng , 2007 ) . 358 Assessment of SARS - CoV - 2 concentrations based on rRT - qPCR tests of material in swab and filter 359 samples ( Maestre et al . , 2021 ) as well as by mathematical modeling ( Pease et al . , 2021 ) have indicated 360 that SARS - CoV - 2 transport within residences is plausible . Though we cannot conclude from this 361 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 investigation how SARS - CoV - 2 arrived in the non - isolation room , and we detected only non - viable SARS - 362 CoV - 2 by rRT - qPCR , our detection of vRNA in an air sample in a room far - removed from the isolation 363 suite builds support for potential inhalation risks throughout domestic isolation sites . The detection of 364 SARS - CoV - 2 within a residential air sample collected outside of a designated self - isolation space also 365 supports the need for further research into residential transport and viability of SARS - CoV - 2 and other 366 infectious agents . 367 Successful collection and conservation of airborne viruses has been demonstrated in several studies 368 through the use of CGT collection devices like the BioSpot - VIVAS ( Lednicky et al . , 2016 ; Lednicky et al . , 369 2020 ; Nannu Shankar et al . , 2022 ) , which collect particles by gentle impaction onto a liquid collection 370 medium . The use of devices like gelatin filters ( Santarpia et al . , 2020 ) and cyclones ( Döhla et al . , 2020 ) 371 during environmental air sampling has not led to successful isolation of viable SARS - CoV - 2 in cell 372 cultures . Though an array of air samplers such as PTFE filters , impingers , cascade impactors , and 373 cyclones have been successfully used for the collection of viable virus in aerosols , the proportion of the 374 collected virus that remains viable typically is minimal ( Ratnesar - Shumate et al . , 2021 ) . CGT devices are 375 able to conserve viable virus with greater success due to two advantages : ( a ) minimal damage to the 376 virus , and ( b ) prevention of deleterious desiccation of the virus particles . During the same sampling 377 periods and at nearly the same distance from the volunteer in this work , the BioSpot - VIVAS consistently 378 collected and conserved virus viability , whereas virus collected using the BC - 251 was non - infectious . 379 The results of our work reinforce the growing body of evidence in that CGT devices are suitable devices 380 for exploring potential exposure risks to aerosolized viruses ( Hawks et al . , 2021 ) . 381 Past assessment of the BC - 251 with influenza A virus ( Influenza A / WS / 33 , H1N1 , VR - 825 , ATCC Lot 382 Nos . 58023547 and 58772128 ) resulted in much higher recovery in the second cyclone stage than in the 383 first cyclone stage ( Cao et al . , 2010 ) . Similarly , SARS - CoV - 2 collection primarily in the second 384 fractionalized range of the BC - 251 samples in this work mirrored results from a previous residential study 385 by this research group ( Nannu Shankar et al . , 2022 ) . The presence of virus in particles < 4 . 4 µm is 386 important because this indicates that inhaled virus , if viable , has potential to travel to the lower respiratory 387 tract and infect cells there . From the BioSpot - VIVAS samples , we saw that the concentration of viable 388 virus in air was about 10 - fold higher than that measured in a previous study of a person infected with a 389 variant of SARS - CoV - 2 with high nucleotide sequence identity to the original isolate ( Lednicky et al . , 390 2020 ) . Taken together , the size range , concentration , and demonstrated viability of SARS - CoV - 2 391 collected in air samples during this investigation indicate potential for exposure to airborne virus within a 392 residential environment with a self - isolating COVID - 19 patient . The existence of such exposure potential 393 indicates that co - occupants of residences also housing self - isolating individuals should consider using 394 respiratory protection to reduce SARS - CoV - 2 exposure . 395 Döhla et al . ( 2020 ) detected SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in 4 of 119 surface swabs taken in various homes 396 housing COVID - 19 patients in isolation or persons in quarantine due to SARS - CoV - 2 exposure . 397 Santarpia et al . ( 2020 ) collected swabs from two isolation and nine quarantine hospital rooms , detecting 398 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 14 SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in 70 . 6 % of personal item samples and 75 . 0 % of room items . Nannu Shankar et al . 399 ( 2022 ) detected SARS - CoV - 2 within a swab from the mobile phone of an individual self - isolating with 400 COVID - 19 at home . Each of these studies was unable to confirm the presence of viable virus , despite 401 detecting virus presence by RT - PCR . In general , studies suggest that exposure from fomite 402 transportation to mucus membranes is possible but does not exist as the primary exposure pathway for 403 SARS - CoV - 2 ( Meyerowitz et al . , 2021 ) . Among the environmental surfaces tested in our study , viable 404 virus was only detected on the mobile phone . While it is possible that virus collected from the phone 405 could have been deposited by hand - to - phone transfer , non - detection of viable virus and / or viral RNA by 406 RT - PCR in all other high - touch surface samples indicates that viable virus detection on the phone is 407 consistent with the notion that virus - laden large respiratory droplets deposit close to the emitting source . 408 After over two years of focused response to SARS - CoV - 2 , community mitigation measures intended 409 to reduce the impact of the virus on various populations have varied widely . In the circumstance covered 410 here , a collegiate institution provided isolation housing for students living on - campus who tested positive 411 for SARS - CoV - 2 , but , when no vacancy remained , students were required to isolate off - campus . The 412 policy sought to protect the on - campus community from spread within non - isolation housing areas , but it 413 did so at the expense of off - campus communities , resulting in the movement of a strain of Delta variant 414 SARS - CoV - 2 across multiple states and creating potential for broader regional propagation . In this case , 415 policy necessitated co - occupancy of an automobile for many hours of driving . Past work has isolated 416 SARS - CoV - 2 from an automobile cab driven by an infectious individual ( Lednicky et al . , 2021 ) , 417 demonstrating that exposures during transit create increased risk of transmission and indicating that the 418 movement of sick individuals to areas beyond the community where they contracted SARS - CoV - 2 should 419 be minimized . An epidemiological investigation was beyond the scope of our work , though we noted that 420 the volunteer wore an N95 respirator for the duration of travel ; neither the passenger who traveled with 421 the volunteer nor the people living at the house developed signs of COVID - 19 . 422 Given that SARS - CoV - 2 can be detected 1 - 3 days before symptom onset and that viral loads are 423 greatest close to the date of symptom onset , tapering off over a period of about a week in most cases 424 ( WHO , 2020 ; Young et al . , 2020 ) , sampling as we did on day three following mild symptom onset may 425 have occurred at a time - point after peak viral shedding ( Cevik et al . , 2020 ) . While this work does not 426 investigate timeframes most likely to result in peak viral aerosol and virus concentrations on fomites , it 427 does demonstrate potential for viable SARS - CoV - 2 collection from both air and surfaces several days 428 after symptom onset , even with presentation of only mild signs of COVID - 19 . 429 A limitation of this study is that the opportunistic nature of the event and the required travel distance 430 resulted in a low quantity of data . Uncertainty also exists about air flow associated with HVAC systems at 431 the isolation site . The house that had been surveyed has two independent forced - air HVAC systems that 432 are intermittently cycled according to temperature set points . Therefore , airflow was not consistent , and 433 determination of dominant airflow pathways during sampling was not conducted . The distance between 434 the sampling site and sample storage freezer at the laboratory may have affected sample integrity , 435 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 15 resulting in inactivation of some of the collected virus . Ideally , sampling sites should be close to cold 436 storage locations to minimize any such losses . The BC - 251 enabled only partial size fractionation of 437 aerosol particles . A particle counter used in conjunction with air samplers would have provided better 438 fidelity regarding physical particle distributions collected by the samplers . Placement of a second 439 BioSpot - VIVAS in Bedroom # 2 , collocated with the BC - 251 , would have improved the quality of data 440 related to aerosol collection outside of the isolation environment . However , resource limitations prevented 441 this as the research team had access to only a single BioSpot - VIVAS . Relative humidity ( RH ) 442 measurements would have provided better understanding of how sampling conditions might have 443 affected virus transport in the air and virus viability , as it is known that both viability and transport of 444 viruses can change across RH ranges ( Yang & Marr , 2012 ) . Indoor RH in Florida is expected to typically 445 range between 30 % and 60 % ( Withers & Jeff Sonne , 2014 ) . That range of intermediate RH levels has 446 been shown by bacteriophage assessment ( Lin & Marr , 2020 ) and analysis of reported RH levels in 447 literature assessing SARS - CoV - 2 ( Ahlawat et al . , 2020 ) as one which can result in variable impacts on 448 the viability and airborne transportation of virus . Alternatively , modeling of SARS - CoV - 2 biological decay 449 rates ( Aganovic et al . , 2021 ) has indicated that minimal impact on virus viability occurs from 40 % - 60 % 450 RH . To improve understanding of SARS - CoV - 2 aerosol transportation in residences , more expansive 451 studies should collect air samples from a variety of dwelling types housing individuals known to be 452 infected with SARS - CoV - 2 with annotation of environmental factors including temperature , RH , and air 453 exchange rates . 454 455 5 . CONCLUSIONS 456 In this investigation , viable Delta variant SARS - CoV - 2 was detected in air collected by air samplers 457 positioned ~ 3 m from an infected individual experiencing mild symptoms as well as through surface 458 sampling of a device ( mobile phone ) that was in frequent proximity to the individual’s exhaled breath . 459 Results suggested potential for virus transmission through recirculated air flow or opening of doors . Our 460 investigation supports a possibility of SARS - CoV - 2 transport through aerosols and situation - dependent 461 transport through fomites within a single - family home , and we therefore make the following 462 recommendations to reduce virus exposure risk within such settings : ( 1 ) when an individual in a home 463 becomes ill with a respiratory virus , that person should make use of an isolation area whenever possible 464 and endeavor to wear a mask to reduce risk of recirculating infectious virus to other areas of the home , 465 ( 2 ) even outside of an isolation area , persons at increased health risk within a residence housing an ill 466 individual should take precautions to protect themselves from respiratory pathogens by wearing of a 467 suitable face mask , such as an N95 mask , ( 3 ) policy - makers should carefully assess policy decisions so 468 as to not induce unintended second - order effects which require infectious individuals to relocate away 469 from the community where they became ill to another community where they may spread infectious 470 illnesses to new communities . 471 472 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 16 DECLARATION OF COMPETING INTEREST 473 The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships 474 that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper . 475 476 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 477 The work was funded by National Institutes of Health ( Grants No .
