REVI E W Open Access The origin , transmission and clinical therapies on coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) outbreak – an update on the status Yan - Rong Guo 1 † , Qing - Dong Cao 2 † , Zhong - Si Hong 3 † , Yuan - Yang Tan 1 , Shou - Deng Chen 1 , Hong - Jun Jin 1 , Kai - Sen Tan 4 , De - Yun Wang 4 * and Yan Yan 1 , 5 * Abstract An acute respiratory disease , caused by a novel coronavirus ( SARS - CoV - 2 , previously known as 2019 - nCoV ) , the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) has spread throughout China and received worldwide attention . On 30 January 2020 , World Health Organization ( WHO ) officially declared the COVID - 19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern . The emergence of SARS - CoV - 2 , since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) in 2012 , marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large - scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty - first century . As of 1 March 2020 , a total of 87 , 137 confirmed cases globally , 79 , 968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China , with 2977 deaths ( 3 . 4 % ) had been reported by WHO . Meanwhile , several independent research groups have identified that SARS - CoV - 2 belongs to β - coronavirus , with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus , pointing to bat as the natural host . The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor , angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) as that for SARS - CoV , and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract . Importantly , increasingly evidence showed sustained human - to - human transmission , along with many exported cases across the globe . The clinical symptoms of COVID - 19 patients include fever , cough , fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms . The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes , which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) and cytokine storm . Currently , there are few specific antiviral strategies , but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation . In this review , we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology , pathogenesis , and clinical characteristics of COVID - 19 , and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus .

Military Medical Research ( 2020 ) 7 : 11 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1186 / s40779 - 020 - 00240 - 0 Background In December 2019 , a cluster of pneumonia cases , caused by a newly identified β - coronavirus , occurred in Wuhan , China . This coronavirus , was initially named as the 2019 - novel coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) on 12 January 2020 by World Health Organization ( WHO ) . WHO officially named the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) and Coronavirus Study Group ( CSG ) of the Inter - national Committee proposed to name the new coronavirus as SARS - CoV - 2 , both issued on 11 February 2020 . The Chinese scientists rapidly isolated a SARS - CoV - 2 from a patient within a short time on 7 January 2020 and came out to genome sequencing of the SARS - CoV - 2 [ 1 ] . As of 1 March 2020 , a total of 79 , 968 cases of COVID - 19 have been confirmed in mainland China including 2873 deaths [ 2 ] . Studies estimated the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) of SARS - CoV - 2 to be around 2 . 2 [ 3 ] , or even more ( range from 1 . 4 to 6 . 5 ) [ 4 ] , and familial clusters of pneumonia [ 5 ] outbreaks add to evidence of the epidemic COVID - 19 steadily growing by human - to - human transmission . Origin and transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 The SARS - CoV - 2 is a β - coronavirus , which is enveloped non - segmented positive - sense RNA virus ( subgenus sar - becovirus , Orthocoronavirinae subfamily ) [ 6 ] . Corona - viruses ( CoV ) are divided into four genera , including α − / β − / γ − / δ - CoV . α - and β - CoV are able to infect mammals , while γ - and δ - CoV tend to infect birds . Previously , six CoVs have been identified as human - susceptible virus , among which α - CoVs HCoV - 229E and HCoV - NL63 , and β - CoVs HCoV - HKU1 and HCoV - OC43 with low pathogenicity , cause mild respiratory symptoms similar to a common cold , respectively . The other two known β - CoVs , SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV lead to severe and potentially fatal respiratory tract infections [ 7 ] . It was found that the genome sequence of SARS - CoV - 2 is 96 . 2 % identical to a bat CoV RaTG13 , whereas it shares 79 . 5 % identity to SARS - CoV . Based on virus genome se - quencing results and evolutionary analysis , bat has been suspected as natural host of virus origin , and SARS - CoV - 2 might be transmitted from bats via unknown intermediate hosts to infect humans . It is clear now that SARS - CoV - 2 could use angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) , the same receptor as SARS - CoV [ 8 ] , to infect humans ( upper panel , Fig . 1 ) . Epidemiology − reservoirs and transmission The epidemic of unknown acute respiratory tract infec - tion broke out first in Wuhan , China , since 12 December 2019 , possibly related to a seafood market . Several stud - ies suggested that bat may be the potential reservoir of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 9 , 10 ] . However , there is no evidence so far that the origin of SARS - CoV - 2 was from the seafood market . Rather , bats are the natural reservoir of a wide variety of CoVs , including SARS - CoV - like and MERS - CoV - like viruses [ 11 – 13 ] . Upon virus genome sequen - cing , the COVID - 19 was analyzed throughout the genome to Bat CoV RaTG13 and showed 96 . 2 % overall genome sequence identity [ 8 ] , suggesting that bat CoV and human SARS - CoV - 2 might share the same ancestor , although bats are not available for sale in this seafood market [ 14 ] . Besides , protein sequences alignment and phylogenetic analysis [ 15 ] showed that similar residues of receptor were observed in many species , which pro - vided more possibility of alternative intermediate hosts , such as turtles , pangolin and snacks . Human - to - human transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 occurs mainly between family members , including relatives and friends who intimately contacted with patients or incuba - tion carriers . It is reported [ 16 ] that 31 . 3 % of patients re - cent travelled to Wuhan and 72 . 3 % of patients contacting with people from Wuhan among the patients of non - residents of Wuhan . Transmission between healthcare workers occurred in 3 . 8 % of COVID - 19 patients , issued by the National Health Commission of China on 14 Feb - ruary 2020 . By contrast , the transmission of SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV is reported to occur mainly through nosocomial transmission . Infections of healthcare workers in 33 – 42 % of SARS cases and transmission between pa - tients ( 62 – 79 % ) was the most common route of infection in MERS - CoV cases [ 17 , 18 ] . Direct contact with inter - mediate host animals or consumption of wild animals was suspected to be the main route of SARS - CoV - 2 transmis - sion . However , the source ( s ) and transmission routine ( s ) of SARS - CoV - 2 remain elusive . Genome structure and key viral factors Isolated from a COVID - 19 pneumonia patient , a worker in the Wuhan seafood market , the complete genome of Wuhan - Hu - 1 coronavirus ( WHCV ) , one strain of SARS - CoV - 2 , is 29 . 9 kb [ 14 ] . While SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV have positive - sense RNA genomes of 27 . 9 kb and 30 . 1 kb , respectively [ 19 ] . It has been shown that the genome of CoVs contains a variable number ( 6 – 11 ) of open reading frames ( ORFs ) [ 20 ] . Two - thirds of viral RNA , mainly lo - cated in the first ORF ( ORF1a / b ) translates two polypro - teins , pp1a and pp1ab , and encodes 16 non - structural proteins ( NSP ) , while the remaining ORFs encode accessory and structural proteins . The rest part of virus genome encodes four essential structural proteins , includ - ing spike ( S ) glycoprotein , small envelope ( E ) protein , matrix ( M ) protein , and nucleocapsid ( N ) protein [ 21 ] , and also several accessory proteins , that interfere with the host innate immune response . Wu et al . [ 14 ] have recently performed deep meta - transcriptomic sequencing on WHCV , which contained 16 predicted NSP . WHCV exhibits some genomic and phylogenetic similarity to SARS - CoV , particularly in the S - glycoprotein gene and Guo et al . Military Medical Research ( 2020 ) 7 : 11 Page 2 of 10 Fig . 1 Viral and host factors that influence the pathogenesis of SARS - CoV - 2 . Bats are the reservoir of a wide variety of coronaviruses , including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) - like viruses . SARS - CoV - 2 may originate from bats or unknown intermediate hosts and cross the species barrier into humans . Virus - host interactions affect viral entry and replication . Upper panel : Viral factor . SARS - CoV - 2 is an enveloped positive single - stranded RNA ( ssRNA ) coronavirus . Two - thirds of viral RNA , mainly located in the first open reading frame ( ORF 1a / b ) , encodes 16 non - structure proteins ( NSPs ) . The rest part of the virus genome encodes four essential structural proteins , including spike ( S ) glycoprotein , small envelope ( E ) protein , matrix ( M ) protein , and nucleocapsid ( N ) protein , and also several accessory proteins . S glycoprotein of SARS - CoV - 2 binds to host cell receptors , angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) , that is a critical step for virus entry . The possible molecules facilitated membrane invagination for SARS - CoV - 2 endocytosis are still unclear . Other virus proteins may contribute to pathogenesis . Host factors ( Lower panel ) can also influence susceptibility to infection and disease progression . The elderly and people with underlying disease are susceptible to SARS - CoV - 2 and tend to develop into critical conditions . RBD , receptor - binding domain ; HR1 , heptad repeats 1 ; HR2 , heptad repeats 2 Guo et al . Military Medical Research ( 2020 ) 7 : 11 Page 3 of 10 receptor - binding domain ( RBD ) , indicating the capability of direct human transmission . Compared with the known SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV genome , SARS - CoV - 2 is closer to the SARS - like bat CoVs in terms of the whole genome sequence . Most genomic encoded proteins of SARS - CoV - 2 are similar to SARS - CoVs , as well as exist certain differences . At the protein level , there are no amino acid substitutions that occurred in NSP7 , NSP13 , envelope , matrix , or accessory proteins p6 and 8b , except in NSP2 , NSP3 , spike protein , underpinning subdomain , i . e . , RBD [ 22 ] . Another recent research suggested [ 23 ] that the mutation in NSP2 and NSP3 play a role in infectious capability and differentiation mechanism of SARS - CoV - 2 . This provokes people to explore the difference of the host tropism and transmission between SARS - CoV - 2 and SARS - CoV or conduct further investigations on the po - tential therapeutic targets . Zhang et al . [ 24 ] analyzed the genotypes of COVID - 19 in different patients from several provinces and found that SARS - CoV - 2 had been mutated in different patients in China . Although the degree of di - versification of SARS - CoV - 2 is smaller than the mutation of H7N9 avian influenza [ 25 ] . Tang et al . [ 26 ] conducted a population genetic analyses of 103 SARS - CoV - 2 genomes and classified out two prevalent evolvement types of SARS - CoV - 2 , L type ( ~ 70 % ) and S type ( ~ 30 % ) . The strains in L type , derived from S type , are evolutionarily more aggressive and contagious . Thus , virologists and epi - demiologists need to closely monitor the novel corona - virus , in order to inspect the virulence and epidemic . Coronavirus replication and pathogenesis ACE2 , found in the lower respiratory tract of humans , is known as cell receptor for SARS - CoV [ 27 ] and regulates both the cross - species and human - to - human transmission [ 28 ] . Isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) of a COVID - 19 patient , Zhou et al . [ 8 ] have confirmed that the SARS - CoV - 2 uses the same cellular entry receptor , ACE2 , as SARS - CoV . The virion S - glycoprotein on the sur - face of coronavirus can attach to the receptor , ACE2 on the surface of human cells [ 29 ] . S glycoprotein includes two sub - units , S1 and S2 [ 30 ] . S1 determines the virus - host range and cellular tropism with the key function domain − RBD , while S2 mediates virus - cell membrane fusion by two tandem do - mains , heptad repeats 1 ( HR1 ) [ 31 ] and HR2 [ 32 ] . After membrane fusion , the viral genome RNA is released into the cytoplasm , and the uncoated RNA translates two polypro - teins , pp1a and pp1ab [ 33 ] , which encode non - structural proteins , and form replication - transcription complex ( RTC ) in double - membrane vesicle [ 34 ] . Continuously RTC repli - cate and synthesize a nested set of subgenomic RNAs [ 35 ] , which encode accessory proteins and structural proteins . Mediating endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi [ 36 ] , newly formed genomic RNA , nucleocapsid proteins and envelope glycoproteins assemble and form viral particle buds . Lastly , the virion - containing vesicles fuse with the plasma mem - brane to release the virus . Because the binding of SARS - CoV - 2 Spike ( S ) glyco - protein and ACE2 receptor is a critical step for virus entry , virus - receptor binding affinity is under intensive study through different approaches . Systematic detection of β - CoV receptors showed that human cells expressing ACE2 , but not human Dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 ( DPP4 ) or APN ( Aminopeptidase N ) , were enhanced entry of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 37 ] . While , another study showed that S - protein and ACE2 binding efficiency is 10 - to 20 - fold higher than that of SARS - CoV , evidenced by Cryo - EM Structure of the SARS - CoV - 2 Spike in the prefusion conformation [ 38 ] . For SARS - CoV , the cleavage of tri - mer S protein is triggered by the cell surface - associated transmembrane protease serine 2 ( TMPRSS2 ) [ 39 ] and cathepsin [ 40 ] , while the possible molecules facilitated membrane invagination for SARS - CoV - 2 endocytosis are still unclear . Up to the date this review paper was pre - pared , reports showed that the SARS - CoV - 2 may readily transmit , while cause less serious human infection rather than human SARS - CoV . Based on the latest WHO re - port , the number of infected people ( over 80 , 000 globally , updated on 1 March 2020 ) . The global outbreak may due to the following factors : firstly , the unknown pneumonia outbroke at the time of China Spring Festi - val , when the mass population flowing . Secondly , more detailed molecular mechanisms of viral binding and entry manners await to be elucidated , which may ham - per the development of targeted therapy . Thirdly , avail - able data suggested that the SARS - CoV - 2 may be less virulent than the SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV , with the currently analyzed mortality of COVID - 19 is 3 . 4 % , lower than death rate of SARS ( 9 . 6 % ) and MERS ( around 35 % ) , respectively [ 19 ] . Thus , the potential mechanisms for human - to - human transmission and pathogenic mechanisms of the SARS - CoV - 2 are under extensively studied . Clinical characteristics As an emerging acute respiratory infectious disease , COVID - 19 primarily spreads through the respiratory tract , by droplets , respiratory secretions , and direct con - tact [ 41 ] for a low infective dose [ 42 ] . Otherwise , it has been reported a SARS - CoV - 2 was isolated from fecal swabs of a severe pneumonia patient on 10 February 2020 from a critical case in the Fifth Affiliated Hospital , Sun Yat - Sen University , Guangdong , China . Likewise , Zhang et al . [ 43 ] have found the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 in fecal swabs and blood , indicating the possibility of multiple routes transmission . ACE2 protein presents in abundance on lung alveolar epithelial cells and entero - cytes of small intestine remarkably [ 44 ] , which may help understand the routes of infection and disease Guo et al . Military Medical Research ( 2020 ) 7 : 11 Page 4 of 10 manifestations . Based on current epidemiological investi - gation , the incubation period is 1 – 14 days , mostly 3 – 7 days . And the COVID - 19 is contagious during the la - tency period [ 45 ] . It is highly transmissible in humans , especially in the elderly and people with underlying dis - eases . The median age of patients is 47 – 59 years , and 41 . 9 – 45 . 7 % of patients were females [ 16 , 41 , 46 ] . As it is designated SARS - CoV - 2 , COVID - 19 patients presented certainly similar symptoms , such as fever , malaise , and cough [ 47 ] . Most adults or children with SARS - CoV - 2 infection presented with mild flu - like symptoms and a few patients are in critical condition and rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome , respiratory failure , multiple organ failure , even deaths [ 48 ] . Diagnostic criteria The viral research institution in China has conducted preliminary identification of the SARS - CoV - 2 through the classical Koch ’ s postulates and observing its morph - ology through electron microscopy [ 49 ] . So far , the golden clinical diagnosis method of COVID - 19 is nucleic acid detection in the nasal and throat swab sampling or other respiratory tract samplings by real - time PCR and further confirmed by next - generation sequencing . Clinical symptoms A recent study led by Prof . Nan - Shan Zhong ’ s team , by sampling 1099 laboratory - confirmed cases , found that the common clinical manifestations included fever ( 88 . 7 % ) , cough ( 67 . 8 % ) , fatigue ( 38 . 1 % ) , sputum produc - tion ( 33 . 4 % ) , shortness of breath ( 18 . 6 % ) , sore throat ( 13 . 9 % ) , and headache ( 13 . 6 % ) [ 16 ] . In addition , a part of patients manifested gastrointestinal symptoms , with diarrhea ( 3 . 8 % ) and vomiting ( 5 . 0 % ) . The clinical mani - festations were in consistence with the previous data of 41 , 99 , and 138 patients analysis in Hubei province [ 46 , 48 , 50 ] . Fever and cough were the dominant symptoms whereas upper respiratory symptoms and gastrointes - tinal symptoms were rare , suggesting the differences in viral tropism as compared with SARS - CoV [ 51 ] , MERS - CoV [ 52 ] , and influenza [ 53 ] . The elderly and those with underlying disorders ( i . e . , hypertension , chronic ob - structive pulmonary disease , diabetes , cardiovascular dis - ease ) , developed rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome , septic shock , metabolic acidosis hard to cor - rect and coagulation dysfunction , even leading to the death [ 48 ] ( lower panel , Fig . 1 ) . In laboratory examination results , most patients had normal or decreased white blood cell counts , and lym - phocytopenia [ 16 , 54 ] . But in the severe patients , the neutrophil count , D - dimer , blood urea , and creatinine levels were higher significantly , and the lymphocyte counts continued to decrease . Additionally , inflamma - tory factors ( interleukin ( IL ) - 6 , IL - 10 , tumor necrosis factor - α ( TNF - α ) increase , indicating the immune status of patients . The data showed that ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL - 2 , IL - 7 , IL - 10 , granulocyte colony - stimulating factor ( GCSF ) , 10 kD interferon - gamma - induced protein ( IP - 10 ) , monocyte chemo - attractant protein - 1 ( MCP - 1 ) , macrophage inflammatory protein 1 - α ( MIP - 1 α ) , and TNF - α [ 48 ] . Moreover , the CT imaging showed that computed tom - ography on the chest was ground - glass opacity ( 56 . 4 % ) and bilateral patchy shadowing ( 51 . 8 % ) [ 16 ] , sometimes with a rounded morphology and a peripheral lung distri - bution , analyzed from the patients in the Fifth Affiliated Hospital , Sun Yat - Sen University [ 55 ] . Clinicians have been aware that , a part of confirmed patients appeared the normal CT image presentations . The diagnostic sensitivity of radiologic is limited , so it is necessary to verify with clinical symptoms and virus RNA detections . Complications and clinical outcomes Based on the current information , most patients had a good prognosis , while a few patients were in critical condi - tion , especially the elderly and those with chronic under - lying diseases . As of 1 March 2020 , a total of 79 , 968 confirmed cases , including 14 , 475 ( 18 . 1 % ) with severe ill - ness , and 2873 deaths ( 3 . 5 % ) in mainland China had been reported by WHO [ 2 ] . Complications included acute re - spiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , arrhythmia , shock [ 46 ] , acute kidney injury , acute cardiac injury , liver dys - function and secondary infection [ 48 ] . The poor clinical outcome was related to disease severity . The disease tends to progress faster in elderly people , with the median num - ber of days from the occurrence of the first symptoms to death shorter among people aged 65 years or more [ 56 , 57 ] . Similar to H7N9 patients [ 58 ] , the elderly male with comorbidities and ARDS showed a higher death risk . Add - itionally , more than 100 children were infected , with the youngest being 30 h after birth [ 59 ] . Neonates and the eld - erly need more attention and care due to their immature or weak immune system . Host immune response and immunopathology The immune response is vital for the control and reso - lution of CoV infections , while it can also lead to immu - nopathogenesis , associated with the immune response out of control . The S proteins of Coronavirus binds to the host cells by ACE2 , fusing to the membrane and release the viral RNA . The viral RNAs , as pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) , are detected by the pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) . Usually , Toll - like receptor ( TLR ) 3 , TLR7 , TLR8 , and TLR9 sense viral RNA and DNA in the endosome [ 60 , 61 ] . The viral RNA receptor retinoic - acid inducible gene I ( RIG - I ) [ 62 ] , cytosolic recep - tor melanoma differentiation - associated gene 5 ( MDA5 ) and nucleotidyltransferase cyclic GMP - AMP synthase Guo et al . Military Medical Research ( 2020 ) 7 : 11 Page 5 of 10 ( cGAS ) [ 63 ] are responsible for the recognition of viral RNA and DNA in the cytoplasm . These complex signal - ling recruit adaptors , including TIR - domain - containing adaptor protein including IFN - β ( TRIF ) , mitochondrial antiviral - signalling protein ( MAVS ) [ 64 ] and stimulator of interferon genes protein ( STING ) [ 65 ] to trigger down - stream cascades molecules , involving adaptor molecule MyD88 and lead to the activation of the transcription fac - tor nuclear factor - κ B ( NF - κ B ) and interferon regulatory factor 3 ( IRF3 ) and the production of type I Interferons ( IFN - α / β ) and a series of pro - inflammatory cytokines [ 66 ] . Hence , virus - cell interactions produce a diverse set of immune mediators against the invading virus [ 67 ] . In - nate immunity is needed in a precise regulation to elimin - ate the virus , otherwise will result in immunopathology . A few plasma cytokines and chemokines were observed ascended in COVID - 19 patients , including IL - 1 , IL - 2 , IL - 4 , IL - 7 , IL - 10 , IL - 12 , IL - 13 , IL - 17 , GCSF , macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( MCSF ) , IP - 10 , MCP - 1 , MIP - 1 α , hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) , IFN - γ and TNF - α [ 48 , 68 , 69 ] . Of note , an anatomy report of COVID - 19 pneu - monia corpse [ 70 ] indicated that COVID - 19 caused an inflammatory response in the lower airway and led to lung injury . Collectively , the virus particles invade the respira - tory mucosa firstly and infect other cells , triggering a series of immune responses and the production of cyto - kine storm in the body , which may be associated with the critical condition of COVID - 19 patients . Treatment of COVID - 19 Current therapies Given the lack of effective antiviral therapy against COVID - 19 , current treatments mainly focused on symp - tomatic and respiratory support according to the Diagno - sis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID - 19 ( updated to version 6 ) issued by National Health Commis - sion of the People ’ s Republic of China [ 71 ] . Nearly all patients accepted oxygen therapy , and WHO recom - mended extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) to patients with refractory hypoxemia [ 72 ] . Rescue treat - ment with convalescent plasma and immunoglobulin G [ 73 ] are delivered to some critical cases according to their conditions . Antiviral treatments Based on the experience of fighting the epidemic SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV previously , we may learn some les - sons for some treatment strategies against coronavirus [ 74 ] . Antiviral drugs and systemic corticosteroid treat - ment commonly used in clinical practice previously , in - cluding neuraminidase inhibitors ( oseltamivir , peramivir , zanamivir , etc ) , ganciclovir , acyclovir , and ribavirin , as well as methylprednisolone [ 46 , 75 ] for influenza virus , are invalid for COVID - 19 and not recommended . Remdesivir ( GS - 5734 ) is a 1 ′ - cyano - substituted adeno - sine nucleotide analog prodrug and shows broad - spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses . Based on the data collected from in vitro cell line and mouse model , remdesivir could interfere with the NSP12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofread - ing activity [ 76 ] . Remdesivir has been reported to treat the first US case of COVID - 19 successfully [ 77 ] . Chloro - quine is a repurposed drug with great potential to treat COVID - 19 . Chloroquine has been used to treat malaria for many years [ 78 ] , with a mechanism that is not well understood against some viral infections . Several pos - sible mechanisms are investigated : Chloroquine can in - hibit pH - dependent steps of the replication of several viruses [ 79 ] , with a potent effect on SARS - CoV infection and spread [ 80 ] . Moreover , chloroquine has immuno - modulatory effects , suppressing the production / release of TNF - α and IL - 6 . It also works as a novel class of autophagy inhibitor [ 81 ] , which may interfere with viral infection and replication . Several studies have found that chloroquine interfered with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS - CoV [ 80 ] and functioned at both entry and at post - entry stages of the COVID - 19 infec - tion in Vero E6 cells [ 82 ] . A combination of remdesivir and chloroquine was proven to effectively inhibit the re - cently emerged SARS - CoV - 2 in vitro . Scientists previously confirmed that the protease in - hibitors lopinavir and ritonavir , used to treat infection with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) [ 83 ] , could improve the outcome of MERS - CoV [ 84 ] and SARS - CoV [ 85 ] patients . It has reported that β - coronavirus viral loads of a COVID - 19 patient in Korea significantly decreased after lopinavir / ritonavir ( Kaletra® , AbbVie , North Chicago , IL , USA ) treatment [ 86 ] . Additionally , clinicians combined Chinese and Western medicine treatment including lopinavir / ritonavir ( Kaletra® ) , arbi - dol , and Shufeng Jiedu Capsule ( SFJDC , a traditional Chinese medicine ) and gained significant improvement in pneumonia associated symptoms in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center , China [ 87 ] . The other antiviral drugs include nitazoxanide , favipiravir , nafamostat , and so on ( See Table 1 for details ) . Conclusions The outbreak of COVID - 19 swept across China rapidly and has spread to 85 countries / territories / areas outside of China as of 5 March 2020 [ 2 ] . Scientists have made progress in the characterization of the novel coronavirus and are working extensively on the therapies and vac - cines against the virus . We have summarized the current knowledge of SARS - CoV - 2 as follows : Firstly , the emer - ging pneumonia , COVID - 19 , caused by SARS - CoV - 2 , exhibits strong infectivity but less virulence , compared to SARS and MERS , in terms of morbidity and mortality . Guo et al . Military Medical Research ( 2020 ) 7 : 11 Page 6 of 10 Originating from reservoir of bats and unknown inter - mediate hosts , SARS - CoV - 2 binds to ACE2 with high af - finity as a virus receptor to infect humans . Secondly , the susceptible population involves the elderly and people with certain underlying medical conditions , which re - quires more attention and care . Thirdly , so far , the sup - porting treatments , combined with potent antiviral drugs , such as remdesivir , chloroquine , or lopinavir / rito - navir , have been conducted with definite effect on treat COVID - 19 patients , while solid data from more clinical trials are needed . However , questions remain vague and more studies are urgent to explore the transmission and pathogenicity mechanism of the emerging coronavirus . To make clear the evolutionary path from the original host to cross - species transmission so as to potentially limit the transmission to naïve animals or humans . In addition , to uncover the mystery of the molecular mech - anism of viral entry and replication , which provides the basis of future research on developing targeted antiviral drugs and vaccines . Given more than 80 % of patients are confirmed in Hubei province , the hospitals and medical workers in Hubei are facing and bearing enormous pressure and se - vere challenge , including a high risk of infection and inadequate protection , as well as overwork , frustration and exhaustion [ 105 ] . Chinese Government and author - ities have launched psychological intervention , and we sincerely hope that Chinese people and other countries overcome the epidemic as fast as possible .
