Petersen , * and Bo van Deurs * * Institute for Cancer Research at the Norwegian Radium Hospital and the Norwegian Cancer Society , Oslo , Norway ; and * Department of Anatomy , The Panum Institute , University of Copenhagen , Copenhagen , Denmark Abstract . Acidification of the cytosol of a number of different cell lines strongly reduced the endocytic up - take of transferrin and epidermal growth factor . The number of transferrin binding sites at the cell surface was increased in acidified cells . Electron microscopic studies showed that the number of coated pits at the cell surface was not reduced in cells with acidified cytosol . Experiments with transferrin - horseradish per - oxidase conjugates and a monoclonal anti - transferrin receptor antibody demonstrated that transfen ' in recep - tors were present in , x , 75 % of the coated pits both in control cells and in cells with acidified cytosol . The data therefore indicate that the reason for the reduced endoeytic uptake of transferrin at internal pH < 6 . 5 is an inhibition of the pinching off of coated vesicles . In contrast , acidification of the cytosol had only little effect on the uptake of ricin and the fluid phase marker lucifer yellow . Ricin endocytosed by cells with acidified cytosol exhibited full toxic effect on the cells . Although the pathway of this uptake in acidified cells remains uncertain , some coated pits may still be in - volved . However , the data are also consistent with the possibility that an alternative endocytic pathway in - volving smooth ( uncoated ) pits exists . number of different transport proteins , hormones , growth factors , toxins , and viruses enter cells by re - ceptor - mediated endocytosis . Coated pits and coated vesicles are generally assumed to be involved in this process ( for reviews , see references 33 , 38 , and 59 ) . Upon entry , the ligands are transferred to endosomes where the low pH is es - sential for dissociation of ligands from their receptors , for release of Fe 3 + from transferrin , and for entry into the cyto - sol of viruses and certain toxins . In studies of endocytosis and its role in the mechanism of action of many ligands , it is a problem that no specific inhibi - tor of endocytosis is available . Although treatments with metabolic inhibitors and low temperature inhibit endocyto - sis , these conditions inhibit most other physiological pro - cesses in the cells as well . Recently , removal of cytoplasmic potassium was found to inhibit endocytosis of low density li - poprotein , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , ~ and transferrin ( 29 , 31 , 37 ) . However , such treatment does not efficiently in - hibit the formation of coated vesicles in all cell types ( 37 , 44 ) . Furthermore , K + depletion induces cell shrinkage and in - hibits anion transport ( 32 ) . Alternative methods to inhibit endocytosis from coated pits are therefore warranted . In the course of our studies of the mechanism of action of diphtheria toxin , ricin , and related toxic proteins with intra - cellular sites of action , we noted that acidification of the cytosol inhibited endocytic uptake of different ligands to different extents ( 46 ) . Here we report that acidification of the 1 .

Transferrin , horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) , pronase , EGF , 2 - ( N - morpholino ) ethane sul - fonic acid ( MES ) , SPDP ( 3 - 2 pyridyldithio - propionic acid N - hydroxy - succinimide ester ) , Hepes , Tris , nigericin , and valinomycin were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO . Amiloride was a gift from Merck , Sharp & Dohme , Drammen , Norway . W7 and W5 were purchased from Seikngaku Kogyo Co . , Ltd . , Tokyo , Japan . Transferrin was saturated with iron as described ( 9 ) , and t25I - labeled ligands were prepared by the iodogen method ( 15 ) . Preparation of Conjugates for Electron Microscopy Conjugates of ricin and transferrin with colloidal gold ( particle size 5 - 10 nm , or 20 ran ) were prepared by the method of Slot and Geuze ( 50 ) , and the amount of protein necessary to stabilize the colloidal gold solution was determined by the method of Horisberger and Rmset ( 26 ) . Conjugates of ricin and transferrin with HRP were prepared by the SPDP method as previously described ( 56 , 57 ) . After the eluted fractions were filtered through a Sephacryl - 200 column , they were analyzed by SDS - PAGE , and the monovalent conjugates ( i . e . , those containing one transferrin or ricin molecule and one HRP molecule ) were selected for further experi - ments .

All cell lines used were maintained as monolayer cul - tures in MEM complemented with penicillin , streptomycin , and 10 % ( vol / vol ) FCS in an atmosphere containing 5 % CO2 , The day before use the cells were seeded out into 24 - well disposable trays , petri dishes , or into T - 25 flasks as indicated in the figure legends . Measurement of Receptor - mediated Endocytosis of u ~ ITransferrin , u ~ IIEGF , and lmIRicin The amounts of surface bound and internalized transferrin were measured as described by Ciechanover et al . ( 6 ) . Briefly , cells were incubated with t25Itransferdn for the indicated periods of time at 37 " C , washed three times with ice - cold PBS , and then treated for 1 h at 0°C with 0 . 3 ml serum - free medium containing 0 . 3 % ( wt / vol ) pronase . Then the cells and the medium were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged for 2 min , and the radioactivity in the pellet and supernatant was measured . Endocytosis of t ~ IEGF was measured as described by Haigler et al . ( 22 ) . For this purpose , cells incubated with ~ IEGF were washed five times with ice - cold PBS , and then incubated for 6 min in a solution contain - ing 0 . 5 M NaCI , 0 . 2 M acetic acid , pH 2 . 5 , to release surface bound EGE The cells were then washed once in the same buffer and dissolved . The cell - associated radioactivity was then measured . Endocytosis of 125I - labeled ricin was measured as the amount of toxin that could not be removed from the cells with lactose , as previously de - scribed ( 42 ) . To measure the efficacy of the treatments to remove surface - bound ligands , cells on ice were treated with the t25I - labeled ligands , then washed and treated as above . For transferrin and ricin < 5 % of the bound radioactiv - ity remained associated with the cells after the treatment , whereas for EGF < 72 % radioactivity remained on the cells ( data not shown ) . Endocytosis of Lucifer Yellow Endocytosis of lucifer yellow was measured essentially as described by Swanson et al . ( 52 ) . Cells were incubated for 15 rain with 1 mg / mi lucifer yellow , washed eight times with ice - cold PBS containing 0 . 1 mg / ml BSA , and then dissolved in 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 ( vol / vol ) containing 0 . 1 mg / ml BSA . Fluorescence was measured in a fluorescence spectrometer ( model LS 5 ; Perkin - Elmer Corp . , Norwalk , CT ) with excitation at 430 nm ( band - width , 10 nm ) and emission at 540 nm ( bandwidth , 10 nm ) . Cellular uptake of lucifer yellow was strongly reduced in ATP - depleted cells . Measurement of Cytosolic pH The cytosolic pH was determined from the distribution of the weak acid r4CDMO as described by Deutsch et al . ( 12 ) . Cells were incubated with ~ 4CDMO ( 5 ~ tCi / ml ) for 5 min at 37°C , then washed five times with ice - cold PBS . The cell - associated radioactivity was then measured . The volume of extracellular liquid associated with the cells after they were washed five times was measured after incubation of the cells with ~ Csucrose ( 5 ~ tCi / ml ) . The extracellular space corresponded to 7 % of the cell volume . The total volume of the cells in a well was calculated from the amount of 3HH20 associated with cells after incubation with 1 laCi / ml 3HH20 for 18 h . Measuremen t of Cellular ATP Cells growing in 24 - well disposable trays were treated as indicated in Table II , and 250 ~ tl 2 % ( wt / vol ) ice - cold perchloric acid was added to each well . After 30 rain the perchloric acid extract was collected and centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 rain . From the supernatant 200 ~ tl was re - moved and mixed with 800 Ixl of 0 . 1 M Tris - EDTA , pH 7 . 7 . Dilutions from this solution were made in the same buffer and aliquots were taken and added to a luciferin - lucifemse mixture according to the procedure described by LKB ( Bromma , Sweden ) . Emitted light was measured in an LKB Wallac luminometer 1250 . A standard curve obtained by measuring samples with known amounts of ATP was used to estimate the ATP content in the sample . Experiments with Gold and HRP Conjugates Vero and Hep - 2 cells , grown in monolayers in T - 25 flasks , were washed with Hepes buffer or with the buffer used in the respective experiment and in - cubated with ricin - gold ( Ri - Au ) , transferrin - gold ( Tf - Au ) , or 10 gg / ml monovalent transferrin - HRP ( Tf - HRP ) under the conditions detailed in the figure legends . In some experiments with ricin conjugates , preincubation was performed at 0 - 4°C with excess unlabeled ricin ( 0 . 1 mg / ml ) or with 0 . I M lactose to test the specificity of conjugate binding . Similarly , in some experiments with the transferrin conjugates , preincubation at 0 - - 4°C was performed with excess unlabeled transferrin ( 50 ~ tg / ml ) . After the incubation with the con - jugates , the cells were washed with buffer and further processed for electron microscopy as described below . Ultrastructural Immunocytochemical Detection of Transferrin Receptors Hep - 2 cells in monolayer cultures , with and without NI - hC1 prepulsing , were incubated in 0 . 14 M KC1 , 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 , 1 mM CaC12 , and 1 mM amiloride as described in the figure legends . Then the cells were washed with the same buffer at 4°C and treated with the same buffer containing a mouse monoclonal anti - human transferrin receptor antibody ( diluted 1 : 50 ) ( DAKO - Tf - R M734 ; Dakopatts , Copenhagen , Denmark ) for 60 rain at 40C . After the cells were carefully washed with KCl - amiloride buffer at 4°C , they were treated with peroxidase - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG ( code No . 6450 ; Medac , Hamburg , FRG ) in the same buffer for 60 min at 40C . Finally , the cells were washed carefully at 4 " C with the same buffer and prepared for electron microscopy . In control experiments the primary antibody was omitted from the incubation protocol . Processing for Electron Microscopy Cells in monolayer , treated as described above , were fixed with 2 % glutami - dehyde in 0 . 1 M Na - cacodylate buffer , pH 7 . 2 , for 60 min at room tempera - ture . In experiments with HRP conjugates and peroxidase immunocyto - chemistry , the cells were then washed carefully with PBS and incubated with diaminobenzidine - H2 ( h as previously described ( 56 , 57 ) . The cells were then scraped off the flasks and centrifuged in buffer . Pellets were postfixed with OsO4 , treated with 1 % uranyl acetate in distilled water , em - bedded in Epon , cut at ' x , 50 nm , and examined in a JEOL 100 CX electron microscope as previously described ( 56 , 57 ) . The frequency of coated pits at the cell surface was determined as reported elsewhere ( 31 ) . Results To test if endocytosis of ligands that enter cells from coated pits is influenced by the pH in the cytosol , we studied the in - ternalization of transferrin and EGE Both of these ligands have been shown to enter cells by en - docytosis from coated pits ( 13 , 14 , 20 , 21 , 34 ) . It should be noted , however , that a recent report suggests that EGF is also taken up from uncoated pits ( 24 ) . EGF stimulates internalization of the hormone - receptor complex which is then degraded ( 8 ) , while the receptors for transferrin seem to be internalized constitutively , i . e . , inter - nalization occurs whether or not ligand is bound , and the receptor is then recycled to the cell surface ( 3 ) . We have used three different methods to acidify the cy - tosol . In the first method , which is best tolerated by the cells , we preincubate the cells with NH4C1 to load them with NIL + , and then transfer the cells to medium without NILCI ( 4 ) . Ammonium ions are in equilibrium with NH3 , which is membrane permeant . Therefore , upon removal of extracellular NILC1 , NH3 will rapidly diffuse out of the cells , while the protons are left behind . After such treatment the Na÷ / H ÷ exchanger is normally activated , and the cyto - solic pH is rapidly regulated back to neutrality ( 36 , 46 ) . However , the Na÷ / H ÷ exchanger can be inhibited by amilo - ride or blocked if the cells are transferred to Na + - free buffer . Under such conditions , low intracellular pH can be maintained for a considerable period of time . We have also acidified the cytosol by a method based on the ability of certain weak acids , such as acetic acid , to rap - idly penetrate the cell membrane in its undissociated form .

Effect ' of NH4CI prepulsing on binding and endocytosis of transferrin and EGF . Vero cells growing in 24 - weU disposable trays ( A , C ) and A431 cells growing in petri dishes ( 35 - ram diam ) ( B , D ) were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in Hepes medium ( pH 7 . 0 ) with the indicated concentrations of NH4C1 . The medium was then removed , and 0 . 2 ml ( A , C ) or 0 . 5 ml ( B , D ) 0 . 14 M KCI , con - taining 2 mM CaC12 , 1 mM MgC12 , 1 mM amiloride , and 20 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 0 ) were added . After 5 rain further incubation 125I - la - beled transferrin ( 200 ng / ml , 38 , 600 cpm / ng ) ( A , C ) and EGF ( 7 ng / ml , 15 , 000 cpm / ng ) ( B , D ) were added , and cell - bound ( C , D ) and endocytosed ( A , B ) transferrin and EGF were measured af - ter 10 or 15 min respectively , as described in Materials and Methods . Once in the cytosol , the acid dissociates , thereby lowering the cytosolic pH ( 2 , 40 , 41 ) . A third way to manipulate the cytosolic pH is based on the ability of nigericin to carry out electroneutral K + / H ÷ ex - change . Therefore , when the potassium concentration is equal on the two sides of the plasma membrane , the intracel - lular pH is clamped at the same value as that in the external buffer ( 53 ) . This method allows acurate adjustments of the internal pH . o { NH , CI concentration ( raM ) Figure 2 . Effect of NH4CI prepulsing on cytosolic pH . Vero cells growing in 24 - well disposable trays were incu - bated for 30 min at 37°C in Hepes medium ( pH 7 . 0 ) with and without NI - I4C1 as indicated . Then the medium was removed and 0 . 14 M KCI , contain - ing 2 mM CaC12 , 1 mM MgCI2 , 1 mM amiloride , and 20 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 0 ) was added . After a 5 - min incubation at 37°C t4CIDMO was added , the dis - tribution of DMO was measured after 5 min further incubation , and the cyto - solic pH was calculated as described in Materials and Methods . Effect of NH ~ Cl Prepulsing on Endocytosis of Transferrin , EGF , , Ricin , and Lucifer Yellow In a first set of experiments we lowered the pH in the cytosol by NH4CI preloading and subsequent removal , and mea - sured the effect on the endocytosis of L25I - labeled transferrin and EGE As shown in Fig . 1 , A and B , the internalization of both ligands was strongly reduced after preincubation with 25 mM NH4C1 , whereas preincubation with 10 mM NHaCI had little or no effect . The reduction of endocytosis was not due to the incubation with NI - hC1 as such . Thus , there was no effect on the uptake of EGF and transferrin when NI - LC1 was present throughout the experiment ( data not shown ) . In experiments with the fluorescent probe , BCECF ( 2 ' , 7 ' - bis - 2 - carboxyethyl - 5and - 6carboxyfluorescein , ace - toxymethyl ester ) , we have earlier found that when Vero ceils are preincubated at pH 7 . 0 with 25 mM NI - hCI and then transferred to medium without NI - hCI , the pH in the cyto - sol is reduced at least to pH 6 . 0 , which represents the limit of detection with this method ( 45 ) . To measure the internal pH under the conditions here used , we measured the distri - bution of the weak acid ~ 4C DMO ( 12 ) after incubation of cells with NH4CI and subsequent transfer to buffer without NH4C1 . The data presented in Fig . 2 show that the internal pH decreased linearly with the concentration of NI - hC1 pres - ent during the preincubation , indicating that the internal buffering capacity is essentially constant between pH 6 and 7 . This has also been found in other systems ( 4 ) . By compar - ing the data in Figs . 1 and 2 it appears that to reduce the en - docytosis , the internal pH must be reduced to values below pH 6 . 5 . It should be noted that the concentration of NI - hC1 re - quired during the preincubation varied somewhat ( 25 - - 40 mM ) from experiment to experiment . The reason for this is not known . It is therefore necessary in each experiment in - volving electron microscopy ( see below ) to measure the endocytic uptake of transferrin or EGF in a parallel ex - periment . Although acidification of the cytosol inhibited the endo - cytic uptake of transferrin , it increased the total amount of transferrin associated with the cells ( Fig . 1 C ) . Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicated that the increased bind - ing is due to an increased number of transferrin receptors on the cell surface ( Fig . 3 ) . Thus , acidification of the cytosol af - ter prepulsing with NH4C1 increased the number of trans - ferrin molecules bound per Vero cell from 100 , 000 to 175 , 000 . Maximal increase in binding was obtained 5 - 10 min after the transfer to NHaCl - free buffer ( data not shown ) . The increase in the number of transferrin receptors was de - pendent on Ca 2 + in the medium and could be inhibited by the calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine and W7 . W5 , an inactive analogue of W7 , had no effect ( data not shown ) . The effect of acidification of the cytosol on the amount of EGF associated with the cells was much less , but also in this case a slight increase was observed ( Fig . 1 D ) . The strong reduction in endocytosis occurring after incu - bation with 25 - - 40 mM NI - hCI was rapidly reversible when the internal pH was normalized . Thus , when cells that had been acidified by an NI - hCI prepulse were incubated with transferrin in the presence of Na ÷ to allow pH regulation by Na + / H ÷ exchange to occur , no reduction in endocytic up - take of transferrin was observed . In fact , the total amount of endocytosed transferrin was in that case higher than in con - Sandvig et al .

The medium was then removed and 0 . 14 M KCI , containing 2 mM CaC12 , 1 mM MgCI2 , I mM amiloride , and 20 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 0 ) was added .

They were then washed three times in cold PBS , dissolved in 0 . 1 M KOH , and the radioactivity associated with the cells was measured .

This is probably due to the in - crease in surface binding sites that had taken place while the cytosol was acidified . We also studied the effect of NI - hCI prepulsing on the en - docytic uptake of = 5I - labeled ricin in Vero ceils , Hep 2 cells , MCF7 cells , and A431 cells . In contrast to the results obtained with transferrin and EGF , endocytosis of ricin was only slightly reduced when the cytosol was acidified ( Table I ) . This was confirmed by electron microscopic studies shown below . Also , there was no large effect on the endocyto - sis of the fluorescent fluid phase marker , lucifer yellow , when the cytosol was acidified by prepulsing of the cells with NI - hCI ( Table I ) . In contrast , the uptake of lucifer yellow was strongly inhibited in ATP - depleted cells or when the temperature was reduced to 4°C ( data not shown ) . { ! - i " / f ° 3o \ ~ ~ 180 } ~ 20 ~ ~ ! t40 to g ~ : oo ° - - r - o , t ~ , 8 12 4 ~ ; 2 HAc concentration ( raM ) 5 mln , 37 ' C 10 min , 37 " C Figure 4 .

The data indicate average + SD . § The uptake of lucifer yellow was measured fluorometrically as described in Materials and Methods . Ability of Acetic Acid to Inhibit Endocytosis of Transferrin In experiments where we acidified the cytosol of Vero cells by incubation with acetic acid , we obtained essentially the same results as when the acidification was carried out by NI - I4CI prepulsing . Thus , the endocytosis of transferrin was strongly reduced ( Fig . 4 A ) , and the total amount of transfer - rin associated with cells was increased ( Fig . 4 B ) . The extent of the increase in binding varied between different experi - ments . Furthermore , there was only a slight reduction in up - take of Iz ~ I - labeled ricin ( Table I ) . Regulation of Cytosolic pH by Incubation of CeUs with Nigericin in Isotonic KCI When cells are incubated in isotonic KC1 containing nigeri - cin , the pH in he cytosol will be the same as that in the sur - rounding medium ( 53 ) . Valinomycin was added to ensure a high K + permeability . It is shown in Fig . 5 , that also when the pH in the cytosol was lowered by this method , the en - docytosis of transferrin and EGF was inhibited in all of the four cell lines tested . Consistent with the results described above , the pH must be reduced below pH 6 . 5 to inhibit the endocytosis efficiently . It should be noted that after incubation with isotonic KCI in the presence of valinomycin and nigericin and then trans - fer to normal medium , the endocytosis was not restored as fast as when the cytosol had been acidified by the two other methods . This could be due to incomplete removal of the ionophores . Furthermore , this method also reduced the en - docytic uptake of cell - bound ricin and of lucifer yellow ( Table I ) although not to the same extent as the uptake of transferrin and EGF ( Fig . 5 ) . Apparently , the method dem - onstrated in Fig . 5 has a general toxic effect on the cells ( see below ) . Altogether it may be concluded that acidification of the cytosol by three different methods had essentially the same effect on the uptake of the markers here studied .

Effect of cytosolic pH on endocytosis of transferrin and EGE The cell lines used were growing in 24 - well disposable trays for measurements of transferrin endocytosis ( A ) and in petri dishes ( 35 mM ) for studies of EGF endocytosis ( B ) . The growth medium was removed and 0 . 2 ml ( A ) or 0 . 5 ml ( B ) 0 . 14 M KC1 , containing 2 mM CaCI2 , 1 mM MgC12 , 5 I ~ M nigericin , 10 ~ tM valinomycin , and adjusted to the indicated pH values with Tris , were added . After a 5 - min incubation at 37°C , ~ 25I - labeled transferrin ( 200 ng / ml , 38 , 600 cpm / ng and EGF ( 7 ng / ml , 15 , 000 cpm / ng ) were added , and the amount of endocytosed ligand was measured 10 min ( transfer - rin ) or 15 min ( EGF ) later , as described in Materials and Methods . Effect of Acidification of the Cytosol on the Metabolic Activity of the Cells To test if acidification of the cytosol has a general toxic effect on the cells , we transferred the cells back to normal medium to allow normalization of the internal pH to occur . In a first set of experiments , we added 3Hleucine to the cells 15 min later and measured their ability to incorporate the labeled amino acid during I0 min . The data in Table II show that in cells that had been treated with nigericin , valinomycin , and isotonic KC1 , the rate of protein synthesis was strongly re - duced , whereas in cells that had been acidified by the two other methods , the rate of protein synthesis was only reduced to approximately half the control value . When we measured the rate of 3Hleucine incorporation 12 h later , the rate was close to that in the control cells . Clearly , acidification of the cytosol had only a transient effect on protein synthesis and did not affect cell survival , with the possible exception of acidification by treatment with nigeri - cin , valinomycin , and KC1 . When the ATP level of cells is reduced to < 10 % of the con - trol level , endocytosis in general is blocked ( 51 ) although ex - ceptions may exist ( 19 , 30 ) . As shown in Table UI , the ATP - level was not strongly reduced by any of the three methods here used to acidify the cytosol . Altogether , it may be con - cluded that acidification of the cytosol by NH4C1 prepulsing or by treatment with acetic acid , does not induce any perma - nent damage to the cells , while the method of pH - clamping with KCI and ionophores may have a slight toxic effect . Electron Microscopical Observations To visualize the effect of low pH in the cytosol on endocyto - sis , we carried out ultrastructural studies . In the following we have taken as coated pits any structure ranging from a coated portion of the plasma membrane to a coated vesicular profile located less than three profile diameters away from the plasma membrane ( see also reference 31 ) .

Also smooth pits or invaginations were observed under both control and experimental conditions . Their size varied considerably , from " ~ 50 - 70 nm ( being the most frequent diameter ) and up to , ~ 250 nm ( Fig . 6 ) . Serial section analysis revealed that many endosome - like vacuolar structures in the peripheral cytoplasm were in fact surface connected , thus representing pits ( Fig . 6 ) . The frequency of the various smooth pits was , however , difficult to determine . In the first place , the number ( particularly that of the small ones ) varied considerably from region to region of the cells . Furthermore , it is meaningless to discriminate shallow pits from simple invaginations due to irregular cell surface geom - etry . However , the general impression obtained was that there are from one to eight times as many smooth pits ( all sizes included ) than coated pits ( see also reference 31 ) . The acidified cells showed a somewhat altered morphology , most notably in the Golgi complexes , which exhibited a marked swelling and vesiculation ( not shown ) . We have earlier shown that when Ri - Au or Ri - HRP con - jugates are added to cells at 0 - - 4°C , ricin binding sites are Table III .

Inhibition of Endocytosis by Low Cytosolic pH 683 Figure 6 . Electron microgmphs of Vero cells incubated with various ricin conjugates , a shows a portion of a cell incubated with monovalent Ri - HRP conjugate at 4°C . The conjugate binds evenly to the cell surface and also labels coated pits ( Cp ) and smooth pits ( Sp ) . b represents The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 105 , 1987 684 evenly distributed all over the cell surface ( 55 , 57 ) . Control experiments showed that the binding of these markers was specific . Thus , preincubation with excess of unlabeled ricin or with 0 . 1 M lactose prevented the binding of these con - jugates to the cells ( Fig . 6 b , and data not shown ) . The data in Fig . 6 show that both conjugates were found in practically all coated pits as well as in smooth pits of vari - ous sizes , and no differences could be established between control and acidified cells . At 37°C the amount of surface labeling decreased due to internalization of the conjugates , but it could still be ob - served in coated and smooth pits ( Fig . 6 ) . The conjugates were also present in endosomal elements ( Fig . 6 ) , approxi - mately to the same extent both in control and acidified cells . The ultrastructural observations are therefore in agreement with the biochemical data . In our first attempts to visualize binding and uptake of transferrin , a conjugate of transferrin and gold ( Tf - Au ) was used . The conjugate was found at the cell surface both as sin - gle particles and as aggregates of various sizes . The con - jugate showed a preferential localization to coated pits and their surroundings , while smooth pits were labeled only on occasions . This pattern was found in both control and acid - ified cells . However , since preincubation with unlabeled transferrin did not completely prevent surface labeling , par - ticularly by the larger aggregates , we considered the Tf - Au conjugate as an unreliable marker of the surface distribution of transferrin receptors . To circumvent the problem of unspecific binding we car - ried out further experiments with a monovalent Tf - HRP con - jugate . The binding of this conjugate could be prevented by preincubation with unlabeled transferrin ( data not shown ) . In agreement with previous reports on the transferrin receptor distribution ( 23 , 25 ) the HRP reaction product was mainly found close to or within coated pits , leaving the smaller smooth pits largely unlabeled ( Fig . 7 ) . The largest smooth pits were never labeled . The frequency of Tf - HRP labeled coated pits in nonacidified and acidified Hep - 2 cells was ap - proximately the same ( Table V ) . At 37°C Tf - HRP was frequently observed in endosomes in control cells ( Fig . 7 ) . In contrast , almost no endosomal structures were labeled in the acidified cells . This was as ex - pected since the parallel Hep - 2 culture flasks ( same series of experiments ) revealed a decrease in endocytosed usItrans - ferrin from 60 % of the total bound transferrin ( 10 min after addition of transferrin ) in control cells to (cid:127)5 % in acidified cells ( not shown ) . In another set of experiments we visualized transferrin receptors by using immunoperoxidase cytochemistry and a monoclonal mouse anti - human transferrin receptor anti - body . Because of the specificity of the antibody in these ex - periments we used exclusively Hep 2 cells , which are of hu - man origin . This approach gave approximately the same results as described above for the Tf - HRP conjugate ( Fig . 7 and Table V ) . Immunocytochemical reaction product clearly was most distinct within or close to coated pits ( Fig . 7 ) . Smaller smooth pits were sometimes weakly labeled , but no reaction product was observed in distinct , large pits . The labeling was almost completely prevented when the primary antibody was omitted from the incubation protocol . It should also be noted that similar experiments carried out with other human cell types ( 39 ) gave identical results ( data not shown ) . From the ultrastructural studies the following conclusions can be made . ( a ) Molecules binding ricin are distributed with a high frequency all over the cell surface including coated pits and smooth pits and invaginations of various sizes , whereas transferrin receptors are preferentially local - ized to coated pit regions . ( b ) Coated pits are present in acidified cells with approximately the same or at a slightly higher frequency than in control cells . ( c ) Also in acidified cells the coated pits contain transferrin receptors . Toxic Effect of Ricin Endocytosed at Normal and Acidic Internal pH Ricin is a toxic protein that exerts its action on the ribosomes ( 38 ) . We have earlier shown that endocytic uptake of ricin is involved in the mechanism of entry into the cytosol ( 43 , 45 ) . Since the endocytic uptake of ricin is not strongly re - duced by acidification of the cytosol , we decided to study if ricin endocytosed under such conditions can intoxicate cells . In these experiments we used the NH4CI prepulse method to acidify the cytosol . Toxin was added and endocytosis was allowed to proceed for 15 min . Then the cells were trans - ferred to normal medium containing neutralizing amounts of antitoxin to inactivate any toxin present at the cell surface . After incubation overnight the ability of the cells to incor - porate 3Hleucine was measured . The data in Fig . 8 show that protein synthesis in cells treated in this way was inhibited to the same extent as in control cells , where the endocytic uptake of the toxin occurred at normal internal pH . Discussion The major new observation in the present study is that acidification of the cytosol to values below pH 6 . 5 , selec - tively inhibits endocytosis of transferrin and EGF , while it only slightly reduces the endocytic uptake of ricin and lucifer yellow . This conclusion is based on three different methods of acidification and the endocytosis is evaluated both by bio - chemical and morphological methods . To explain why acidification inhibits endocytosis at least three possibilities must be considered : ( a ) At low intracellu - a control experiment where the Ri - HRP binding was prevented by incubation with 0 . 1 M lactose , c - f represent cells incubated with Ri - Au ( 5 - 10 nm ) at 4°C . The even distribution of the frequent ricin binding sites at the cell surface is evident , and coated ( Cp ) and smooth ( Sp ) pits of various sizes are also labeled . Since incubation has been performed at 4°C , the labeled profile in fmust communicate with the cell surface at another plane of sectioning , g - i show cells incubated with Ri - Au ( 5 - 10 nm ) at 4°C and thereafter for 15 min at 37°C . The arrow in g indicates a labeled profile , which may be a peripheral endosome or a pit communicating with the cell surface at another plane of sectioning , h and i are section Nos . 2 and 4 of a series of consecutive sections showing a typical large , smooth pit ( Sp ) with Ri - Au . j - o show cells acidified by prepulsing with 25 mM NH4C1 ( see legends to Fig . 1 ) and then incubated with Ri - Au ( 20 nm in j - l , and 5 - 10 nm in m - o ) for 30 min at 37°C . Coated pits ( Cp ) , smooth pits of various sizes ( Sp ) , and endosomes ( En ) contain the conjugate . Bars , 0 . 25 ~ tm . Sandvig et al .

( b ) At low inter - nal pH the formation of coated pits at the cell surface could be inhibited as in experiments with K + - depletion after hypo - tonic shock ( 28 - 31 ) . ( c ) Low internal pH may inhibit coated pits from pinching off from the cell surface . The first two of these possibilities are contradicted by our ultrastructural observations . Thus , coated pits were present at the cell surface of acidified cells in approximately the same number as in control cells , and in both cases the majority of the coated pits contained transferrin receptors . Therefore , our results are in favor of the third possibility , that acidifica - tion prevents pinching off of coated pits . It remains uncertain how ricin and lucifer yellow were in - ternalized in acidified cells . One possibility is that these mol - ecules were taken up by a population of newly formed coated pits and vesicles that were not immobilized at the cell surface during acidification in contrast to those containing transfer - rin receptors . However , our findings are also compatible with the possibility that an alternative ( uncoated ) endocytic pathway is responsible for the uptake of most ricin and lu - cifer yellow . A similar conclusion was recently reached by Moya et al . ( 37 ) and Madshus et al . ( 31 ) in studies of inter - nalization of transferrin and ricin in K + - depleted cells . The crucial and still unanswered question now is : what is the structural equivalent to such an alternative endocytic pathway ? Obviously , one must look for surface pits contain - ing binding sites for ricin , but not for transferrin . We found that the smooth pits , in particular the larger ones , represent such structures . At least four recent electron microscopic studies using ferritin or gold probes have suggested that smooth surface pits are involved in endocytosis . Thus , Huet et al . ( 27 ) found that IgG - ferritin binding to the major histo - compatibility surface antigens of cultured human fibroblasts was localized to smooth pits rather than coated pits and that the ligand was subsequently internalized .

Toxic effect of ricin endocytosed at normal and acidic in - ternal pH . Vero cells growing in 24 - well disposable trays were in - cubated for 30 min at 37°C in Hepes medium ( pH 7 . 0 ) with and without 25 mM NI - hCI . The medium was then removed and 0 . 14 M KCI , containing 2 mM CaC12 , 1 mM MgCI2 , 1 mM amiloride , and 20 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 0 ) was added . After a 5 - rain incubation at 37°C increasing concentrations of ricin were added and , after 15 min further incubation , growth medium containing neutralizing amounts of antiricin was added . The cells were then incubated over - night and finally the ability of the cells to incorporate 3Hleucine was measured as described in Materials and Methods . tesano et al . ( 35 ) found that tetanus toxin and cholera toxin bound to smooth pits rather than to coated pits and were sub - sequently internalized by smooth vesicles in cultured liver cells . Hopkins et al . ( 24 ) found that while transferrin was taken up via coated pits and vesicles in cultured epitheloid A431 cells , EGF induced formation of smooth pits which then internalized the ligand . Furthermore , Ghitescu et al . ( 18 ) found that smooth pits and vesicles were involved in receptor - mediated transcytosis of albumin - Au in capillary endothelial cells . However , criticisms against an endocytic role of the small , smooth surface pits have been raised in studies analyzing thin serial sections of endothelial cells ( 5 , 16 ) . These studies showed that practically all structures believed to be en - dothelial vesicles were in fact surface connected and there - fore probably not involved in endocytosis . Also , that a given small , smooth surface pit contains a certain ligand does not necessarily imply that it represents a forming endocytic vesi - cle . Previous studies have shown that recycling vesicles be - ing in the process of exocytosis may have the same size and appearance ( 54 ) . It should also be noted that the appearance of secretory vesicles ( the constitutive pathway ) coming from the Golgi complex is largely unknown , and some small , smooth pits at the cell surface could therefore represent sec - retory vesicles . Altogether , it appears that the small smooth pits at the cell surface may very well represent a heteroge - neous population of structures with various , largely non - endocytic , but hitherto unknown functions . The larger smooth pits ( Fig . 6 , f - i , and n ) at the cell sur - face represent an alternative to the small , smooth pits as can - Sandvig et al . Inhibition of Endocytosis by Low Cytosolic pH 687 didates for structures involved in endocytosis of ricin ( see also reference 55 ) . Although it is impossible at present to prove their role in endocytosis , it is obvious that even a rela - tively few such structures would engulf sufficient material to quantitatively be of great importance in endocytosis . How - ever , further studies are still necessary to prove or disprove this concept . Schlossman et al . ( 49 ) found that both spontaneous and ATP - dependent release of clathrin from coated vesicles were inhibited at low pH . However , as shown here , inhibition of endocytosis at low pH is not due to accumulation of coated vesicles in the cytosol . Rather low pH in the cytosol appears to prevent coated pits from pinching off and forming coated vesicles . When the cytosol was acidified we found a higher amount of transferrin bound at the cell surface than in control cells . This increase is probably not due to inhibition of endocyto - sis , since increased binding was already observed at cyto - solic pH values that were higher than those required to block endocytosis . Also , at 37°C the total amount of transferrin as - sociated with cells having low cytosolic pH was higher than in control cells incubated with transferrin at 37°C . Recently , redistribution of internal transferrin receptors to the cell sur - face has been shown to occur upon addition to cells of serum , insulin , insulin - like growth factors , EGF , and platelet - derived growth factor ( 10 , 11 , 58 ) . Similarly to the results described in the present paper , Ca 2÷ in the medium was re - quired for the serum - induced redistribution . It has been suggested that calmodulin or another Ca2÷ - dependent regu - latory protein is involved in an exocytic reaction . Shecter et al . ( 48 ) found that trifluoperazine inhibits insulin - induced exocytosis of glucose transporters . Furthermore , both triflu - operazine and W7 inhibit secretion in Paramecium ( 17 ) . Re - cently , Adelsberg and Al - Awqati ( 1 ) showed that internal low pH induces exocytosis of proton pumps in the turtle bladder epithelium by a Ca2 + - dependent mechanism , and it is possi - ble that the increased number of transferrin receptors at the cell surface is due to a related process . Our finding that trifluoperazine and W7 prevent the acidification - induced in - crease in transferrin binding capacity is in agreement with this suggestion . In conclusion , we have shown that acidification of the cytosol selectively inhibits the internalization of certain mol - ecules by inhibiting pinching off of coated pits , whereas the uptake of other molecules was only slightly reduced . Our data are compatible with the notion that two endocytic path - ways may operate in parallel , and that only one of them , the coated pit pathway , is inhibited at low intracellular pH .
