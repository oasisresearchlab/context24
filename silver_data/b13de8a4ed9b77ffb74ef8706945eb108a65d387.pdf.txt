In this study , we investigated the implica - tion of Dyn2 as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for progressive prostate cancer ( PCA ) . We evaluated Dyn2 protein expression by immunohisto - chemistry in two cohorts : men with localized PCA treated by retropubic radical prostatectomy ( n = 226 ) , and men with advanced / castrate - resistant PCA ( CRPC ) treated by transurethral resection of prostate ( TURP ) ( n = 253 ) . The role of Dyn2 in cell invasiveness was assessed by in vitro and in vivo experi - ments using androgen - responsive and refractory PCA preclinical models . Dyn2 expression was signiﬁcantly increased across advanced stages of PCA compared to benign prostate tissue ( P < 0 . 0001 ) . In the CRPC cohort , high Dyn2 was associated with higher Gleason score ( P = 0 . 004 ) and marginally with cancer - speciﬁc mortality ( P = 0 . 052 ) . In preclinical models , Dyn2 gene silencing signif - icantly reduced cell migration and invasion in vitro , as well as tumor size and lymph node metastases in vivo . In isolated PCA cells , Dyn2 was found to regu - late focal adhesion turnover , which is critical for cell migration ; this mechanism requires full Dyn2 compared to mutants deﬁcient in GTPase activity . In conclusion , Dyn2 overexpression is associated with neoplastic prostate epithe - lium and is associated with poor prognosis . Inhibition of Dyn2 prevents cell invasiveness in androgen - responsive and - refractory PCA models , supporting the potential beneﬁt of Dyn2 to serve as a therapeutic target for advanced PCA . 14 ª 2013 The Authors .

Cancer Medicine Open Access Introduction Prostate cancer ( PCA ) is the second most common cause of cancer - related deaths in men . Although mortality has fallen by 25 % over the last decade , and the 5 - year survival rate for localized disease is now approaching 100 % [ 1 ] , metastatic and castrate - resistant PCA ( CRPC ) remain a major cause of cancer - speciﬁc deaths . Currently , it is difﬁ - cult to reliably differentiate between aggressive and indo - lent forms of PCA prior to treatment implementation . Increasing efforts have been made to identify genomic and proteomic alterations associated with PCA progression , and in few of those studies , dynamin ( Dyn ) 2 , a member of the large GTPase superfamily was identiﬁed among genes found to be differentially expressed between benign and PCA tissues [ 2 , 3 ] . However , the signiﬁcance of Dyn2 over - expression in PCA has not been fully addressed . Dyn is a 96 - kDa GTPase originally identiﬁed as a micro - tubule - binding protein and subsequently found to contain a GTP - binding domain [ 4 , 5 ] . It comprises three isoforms : Dyn1 , which is localized primarily to the central nervous system , and predominantly concentrated in the pre - synapse ; Dyn2 , which exhibits ubiquitous tissue distribu - tion ; and Dyn3 , which is predominantly expressed in the testis and the nervous system postsynapse [ 6 ] . Dyn2 is implicated in a broad range of physiological functions , par - ticularly in the regulation of membrane trafﬁcking where it represents an essential component of vesicle formation in receptor - mediated endocytosis , synaptic vesicle recycling , caveolae internalization , and vesicle trafﬁcking in and out of Golgi apparatus [ 7 , 8 ] . Dyn2 plays a dual role in clath - rin - mediated endocytosis , functioning at early stages to regulate clathrin - coated pit maturation and at later stages to directly catalyze membrane ﬁssion and clathrin - coated vesicle formation [ 9 ] . In addition to its role in the scission of coated vesicles , Dyn2 regulates invagination of clathrin - coated pits [ 10 ] and interacts with additional proteins , including microtubules , to regulate cytokinesis [ 11 ] . Mutations in the Dyn2 gene have been linked to inherent rare diseases such as centronuclear myopathy , Charcot – Marie – Tooth type B , as well as Alzheimer’s disease and cancer [ 12 – 15 ] . In cancer , both enzymatic activity and proper localization of Dyn2 are required for extracellular matrix degradation by invasive cancer cells [ 15 ] . Dyn2 is also necessary for the endocytosis of several proteins associ - ated with cancer motility and invasiveness , including inte - grin b - 1 and focal adhesion ( FA ) kinase [ 16 , 17 ] . In this study , we investigate Dyn2 expression across var - ious stages of PCA progression , including benign prostate tissue ( BN ) high - grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( HGPIN ) , localized PCA and aggressive PCA ( CRPC ) . The prognostic signiﬁcance of Dyn2 in PCA patients is also assessed . Moreover , the association between Dyn2 expression and PCA invasion and metastasis was charac - terized using in vitro and in vivo experiments in androgen - responsive and androgen - resistant PCA models . Materials and Methods Study population The study population consisted of two cohorts ; the ﬁrst consisted of 226 men with localized PCA treated by retropubic radical prostatectomy as initial monotherapy . Clinical progression was deﬁned as a postoperative serum PSA level increase of > 0 . 2 ng / mL assessed on two separate occasions . Data related to biochemical recurrence were available for 188 patients . The clinical characteristics of this cohort are summarized in Table 1 . The second cohort consisted of 253 men with CRPC . Tissue samples for this cohort were obtained by transurethral resection of prostate ( TURP ) . Patients in this cohort were diagnosed with CRPC or advanced disease and they were either managed expectantly or treated by radiotherapy or hor - monal therapy . Gleason grading was scored according to the International Society of Urological Pathology [ 18 ] and tumor staging done using the TNM classiﬁcation of malignant tumors . Pathological TNM system in CRPC samples deﬁnes pT1a as tumor volumes ≤ 5 % and pT1b as > 5 % . Follow - up data were obtained through the Alberta provincial cancer registry and reported for all patients . Deaths were divided into those related to PCA Table 1 .

Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd . 15 B . Xu et al . Dyn2 Regulates PCA Progression or other causes . Disease - speciﬁc survival was calculated from the date of TURP procedure to mortality date or last follow - up . Patients were considered to have PCA - speciﬁc mortality if they had documented advanced clinical pathological or radiological evidence of disease while on anti - hormonal therapy . Deaths , lacking these criteria , were not considered to have been attributable to PCA . Patients alive at the time of data collection were censored . In this cohort , 241 patients with conﬁrmed clinical outcome data were available for analysis with mean follow - up of 30 months ( range 0 – 60 months ) . Table 2 shows patients demographics of this cohort rel - ative to Dyn2 expression . All clinicopathological data were obtained with approval of institutional review boards . Tissue microarray construction Tissue microarray ( TMA ) blocks were created using a manual tissue arrayer ( Beecher Instruments , Silver Spring , MD ) as previously described [ 19 ] . For each case , cores from multiple areas were used . HGPIN and adjacent benign tissue were also sampled ( when applicable ) . After construction , 4 l m sections were initially cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to verify the histological diagnosis . Dyn2 immunohistochemistry The slides were incubated for 60 min at 37 ° C using Ven - tana autostainer with Dyn2 polyclonal antibody ( H - 300 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc . , Santa Cruz , CA ; 1 : 25 ) . A Ventana iView DAB detection kit ( Ventana , Tucson , AZ ) was used for HRP detection and counterstain . A multi - tissue control TMA slide was used as control . Negative controls were performed by substituting the primary anti - body with pre - diluted normal mouse serum at a dilution of 1 : 200 . Pathologic analysis TMA cores were assigned a diagnosis by two certiﬁed pathologists . Protein expression intensity was evaluated semiquantitatively without prior knowledge of any clinical information using a four - tiered system ( 0 , negative ; 1 , weak ; 2 , moderate ; and 3 , strong ) as previously described [ 19 ] . Each core was evaluated separately and a ﬁnal score for each case was achieved by averaging the total intensity value of all cores within a speciﬁc patient sample . Statistical analysis Subject characteristics were presented as means , standard deviations , and ranges for continuous variables , and fre - quencies and percentages for categorical variables . Tukey test was used to compare the difference in Dyn2 expres - sion and pathological diagnoses , followed by multiple comparison tests . Chi - square test or Fisher’s exact test was used to test for associations between the status of Dyn2 and other key variables such as diagnosis , patholog - ical stage , surgical margin , and tumor grade . For the time to cancer - speciﬁc mortality , the Kaplan – Meier approach along with the log - rank test was used to explore the asso - ciation between Dyn2 expression and cancer - speciﬁc deaths . All reported P - values are two - tailed and were con - sidered signiﬁcant if < 0 . 05 .

RPMI medium ( Life Technologies , Rockville , MD ) supple - mented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 1 % penicil - lin / streptomycin . The non - immortalized normal prostate epithelial cells ( PrEC ) were from Clonetics ( Bulletkit ; Clonetics Corporation , San Diego , CA ) and maintained in their proprietary serum - free media . Dyn2 silencing and reconstitution A 19 - nucleotide sequence used to target human Dyn2 mRNA : GACATGATCCTGCAGTTCA [ 22 ] and scrambled negative control sequence were cloned into pSuper - retro puromycin vector according to the manufacturer’s instruc - tions ( Oligoengine , Seattle , WA ) . After packaging in Phoe - nix cells , the retrovirus contains either control scrambled shRNA ( PSR [ pSUPER retro vector ] ) or Dyn2 shRNA were collected to infect target cells as we described previously [ 23 ] . For reconstitution experiments , Dyn2 silenced PC3 cells were transfected with either wild - type Dyn2 ( siR - NA + WT ) , a GTPase - deﬁcient mutant ( siRNA + K44A ) , a proline - rich domain ( PRD ) mutant in which the entire C - terminal PRD was deleted ( siRNA + D PRD ) or a pleck - strin - homology ( PH ) domain mutant where a substitution of lysine 535 to alanine was introduced ( Dyn2 + K535A ) [ 24 ] . Western blot analysis Cell lysates were boiled and separated using 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS PAGE ) gel as we described earlier [ 25 ] . Membranes were immunoblotted with anti - Dyn2 ( H - 300 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc . ; 1 : 200 ) and anti - glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) ( clone 6C5 ; Cedarlane Laboratories , Ontario , Canada ; 1 : 2000 ) . Cell proliferation and invasion assay Exponentially growing cells ( 1 9 10 3 ) were seeded in 96 - well plates in complete medium and cell survival was eval - uated 72 h later using the 3 - [ 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ] - 2 , 5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide metabolic assay [ 26 ] . Cell invasion assay was performed using 8 l m porous cham - bers coated with Matrigel ( Becton Dickinson , Bedford , MA ) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations [ 23 ] . Each experiment was performed at least in quadru - plicate and results expressed as mean (cid:1) SD . Statistical sig - niﬁcance was analyzed using Student’s t - test . Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy Immunoﬂuorescence assay was performed as previously described [ 27 ] . Brieﬂy , cells were seeded on coverslips then ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde , followed by blocking and incubated with the following primary antibodies : Dyn2 polyclonal antibody ( H - 300 ; Santa Cruz ; 1 : 100 ) and monoclonal anti - vinculin ( clone hVIN - 1 ; Sigma - Aldrich , Steinheim , Germany ; 1 : 200 ) . Cells were then incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to Texas Red or Cy2 ( Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories , West Grove , PA ) . After mounting with gelvatol medium ( Airvol (cid:2) 205 polyvinyl alcohol , Air products and Chemicals , Inc . , Allen - town , PA ) , coverslips were analyzed using a ﬂuorescent microscope ( Axiophot ; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Inc . ) . Analysis of FA dynamics in live cells FA turnover was investigated using a real - time imaging by confocal microscopy as described earlier [ 27 ] . Brieﬂy , cells were transfected with EYFP - paxillin ( a FA marker ) and plated into a multi - well chambered cover glass ( LabTek , Nalge Nunc International , Rochester , NY ) . After starva - tion , the cells were stimulated with 10 ng / mL epidermal growth factor . Fluorescent images were captured every 4 min for 2 h using Nipkow spinning disk confocal micro - scope ( WaveFx spinning disk ; Quorum Technologies Inc . , Guelph , Canada ) . For quantiﬁcation of FA protein dynam - ics , ﬂuorescence intensities of individual adhesions from background - subtracted images were measured over time using Volocity imaging software ( PerkinElmer , Waltham , MA ) and quantiﬁed as we described earlier [ 27 ] . For each condition , measurements were made on at least 25 indi - vidual adhesions in 10 separate cells . Duration measure - ments were made for same adhesions by counting the amount of time lapsed between the ﬁrst and last frames in which an individual adhesion was observed . Data on graphs are presented as mean (cid:1) SD . Statistical signiﬁcance was evaluated using Student’s t - test . In vitro and in vivo studies in PCA preclinical models In vivo studies were approved by Institutional Animal Care Committee . Male SCID mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories ( St . Zotique , PQ , Canada ) . PC3 cells ( 1 9 10 6 cells ) expressing Dyn2 shRNA ( siRNA - Dyn2 ) or scrambled shRNA ( PSR ) were injected orthotopically into mice prostates ( n = 10 ) . The cell lines LNCaP and C4 - 2 were washed twice in PBS and then mixed with matrigel ( Becton Dickinson ) at 3 : 1 ratio of medium to matrigel . 2 9 10 6 cells per 100 l L were then inoculated in the mouse prostate . Animals were sacriﬁced 9 weeks after inoculation . Primary tumors were isolated and weighted , and lymph node metastases were counted . Results were analyzed for statistical signiﬁcance as previously described [ 26 ] . ª 2013 The Authors . Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd . 17 B . Xu et al . Dyn2 Regulates PCA Progression Results Elevated Dyn2 expression levels are associated with early PCA development A total of 1780 cores were available for analysis . Samples included adjacent benign tissue ( n = 192 ) , HGPIN ( n = 48 ) , localized PCA ( n = 942 ) , and CRPC ( n = 598 ) . Immunohistochemistry staining showed a signiﬁcant increase in Dyn2 expression in neoplastic epithelium compared to adjacent benign tissue . Mean intensity levels were lowest in BN ( 0 . 91 (cid:1) 0 . 78 ) and highest in CRPC ( 2 . 37 (cid:1) 0 . 78 ) ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 1A ) . Mean intensity levels in HGPIN and localized PCA were ( 2 . 21 (cid:1) 0 . 54 ) and ( 2 . 13 (cid:1) 0 . 78 ) , respectively . Both expressions were signiﬁ - cantly higher than those observed in adjacent BN ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 1B ) . However , differences between HGPIN and each of localized PCA or CRPC were not sig - niﬁcant ( P > 0 . 5 ) . Figure 1A – B illustrates intensity levels of Dyn2 expression across various stages of PCA progres - sion . In agreement with immunohistochemistry data , upregulation of Dyn2 level was observed in isolated PCA cells compared to non - immortalized normal prostate epi - thelial cells ( PrEC ) ( Fig . 1C ) . Elevated Dyn2 expression levels are associated with Gleason score , tumor volume , and PCA - speciﬁc mortality Association between Dyn2 protein expression and Gleason score , tumor volume and cancer - speciﬁc mortality was analyzed using the CRPC cohort . As shown in Figure 2A , a signiﬁcant association between high - Dyn2 protein expression and tumor volume of > 5 % ( reﬂective of pT1a vs . pT1b stage within the TURP samples [ P = 0 . 009 ] ) was observed , while a moderate to high Dyn2 expression was seen in the majority ( ~ 90 % ) of PCA across different Glea - son scores categories . High Dyn2 intensity was associated with higher Gleason score ( P = 0 . 004 ) ( Fig . 2B ) . In this cohort of CRPC , 26 . 2 % ( 38 / 145 ) patients with moderate to high Dyn2 expression had PCA cancer - speciﬁc mortal - ity versus 15 . 6 % ( 15 / 96 ) of patients with negative or weak Dyn2 expression ( P = 0 . 052 ) ( Fig . 2C ) . Using Cox regres - sion model in this TURP cohort , incorporating Dynamin expression , GS and volume , only GS showed to be statis - tically signiﬁcant ( P = 0 . 003 ) . Dyn2 regulates PCA cell invasiveness in vitro and in vivo To investigate the biological signiﬁcance of Dyn2 to PCA progression , we generated clones of LNCaP , C4 - 2 and PC3 cells where Dyn2 was downregulated by stably expressing Dyn2 siRNA compared to control cells expressing scrambled siRNA ( Fig . 3A ) . In the three cell models tested , inhibition of Dyn2 reduced cell prolifera - tion ( Fig . 3B ) and cell invasion ( Fig . 3C ) in vitro . Simi - lar results were also observed in independent cells expressing the Dyn2 - dominant mutant , K44A ( data not shown ) . In vivo , Dyn2 downregulation ( siRNA - Dyn2 ) was achieved in the invasive and androgen receptor negative cell line PC3 , and the androgen - responsive LNCaP and their matched androgen - resistant variant C4 - 2 cells .

Implantation of these cells and their matched controls ( PSR ) into the prostates of mice ( n = 10 per condition ) revealed no difference in tumor uptake between control and Dyn2 - knockdown groups . However , a signiﬁcant decrease in tumor weights was noted in both androgen - resistant ( 3 . 313 (cid:1) 0 . 494 [ PSR ] vs . 1 . 112 (cid:1) 0 . 461 [ siRNA - Dyn2 ] for PC3 , and 1 . 82 (cid:1) 0 . 43 [ PSR ] vs . 0 . 832 (cid:1) 0 . 27 [ siRNA - Dyn2 ] for C4 - 2 ) and the androgen - responsive LNCaP cells ( 1 . 618 (cid:1) 0 . 272 [ PSR ] vs . 0 . 492 (cid:1) 0 . 256 [ siR - NA - Dyn2 ] ) ( Fig . 4A ) . A signiﬁcant reduction in lymph node metastases was noted in PC3 cells , the only cell line able to induce macroscopic lymph node metastases in our condition ( Fig . 4B ; the number of metastases in lymph nodes were 8 . 250 (cid:1) 0 . 240 [ PSR ] vs . 1 . 000 (cid:1) 1 . 410 [ siR - NA - Dyn2 ] ) . Downregulation of Dyn2 expression stabilizes FAs The impact of Dyn2 inhibition on PCA progression sug - gests an effect on cell invasion signaling . In particular , Dyn2 plays a major function in endocytosis of proteins involved in FA signaling , including integrin b - 1 and FA kinase ( FAK ) [ 16 , 28 ] . To examine this mechanism , ﬂuo - rescence microscopy following immunostaining with anti - vinculin ( a marker of FA ) , revealed a signiﬁcant increase in the expression of vinculin at plasma membrane protru - sions in siRNA - Dyn2 cells compared to matched control cells ( Fig . 5A ) . Time - lapse confocal microscopy in live cells revealed that FA proteins remain stable for a pro - longed period of time in Dyn2 - silenced cells ( siRNA - Dyn2 ) compared to control cells ( Fig . 5B ) , in support of our previous study showing a correlation between high cell invasiveness and accelerated turnover of FA [ 29 ] . Dyn2 protein is organized into a GTPase domain , middle domain , pleckstrin - homology ( PH ) domain , GTPase - effector domain , and PRD . To conﬁrm the role of Dyn2 in FA turnover in PCA cells , FA disassembly rate was examined in Dyn2 - silenced cells reconstituted with either rat WT Dyn2 or Dyn2 mutant deﬁcient in GTPase , PRD , or PH domain . As shown in Figure 5C , reconstitution of Dyn2 - silenced cells with Dyn2 mutants D PRD and K535A can partially restore FA turnover ( P < 0 . 05 ) and WT Dyn2 was necessary for full restoration of FA disassembly defect . These results support that the GTPase domain is necessary for Dyn2 - induced FA turnover . A B C Figure 2 .

Dyn2 Regulates PCA Progression Discussion Dyn2 , the most ubiquitous isoform of the dynamin fam - ily , exerts a broad physiological function in the regula - tion of vesicle transport and endocytosis trafﬁcking [ 7 ] . Herein , we demonstrate that Dyn2 expression is elevated in the majority of neoplastic prostate tissues compared to benign tissue and is associated with poor prognosis . The association of Dyn2 with early and advanced stages of PCA is similar to other PCA - associated biomarkers such as the ERG fusion gene [ 30 ] . Our results are further supported by in vitro and in vivo studies in preclinical PCA models where Dyn2 inhibition resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in cell proliferation , and motil - ity and invasion in both androgen - responsive and androgen - resistant PCA cell lines . As well a signiﬁcant reduction in tumor progression was noted when PCA cells where Dyn2 was inhibited were implanted ortho - topic into the mouse prostates compared to controls . Noticeably , a study using a small cohort of samples from pancreatic cancer reported a positive correlation between Dyn2 expression and malignancy although no A B C Figure 3 .

[ 28 ] demonstrated a role of Dyn2 in the regula - tion of FA turnover : they showed that Dyn2 is phosphory - lated by Src kinase and then recruited to FA by a direct interaction with the FERM domain of FAK , which in turn regulates FA turnover as Dyn2 mutants disrupting this interaction fail to promote disassembly . In this context , we have reported the importance of FAK signaling for the reg - ulation of cell invasion and FA turnover [ 23 , 27 , 29 ] . In PCA cells , we observed that Dyn2 inhibition led to a drastic increase in FAs stability , which supports that Dyn2 silenc - ing prevents FA rapid turnover , a perquisite for cell loco - motion and migration . This study also demonstrates that the GTPase activity of Dyn2 is required for the regulation of FA turnover and cell motility in PCA cells . This has sig - niﬁcance to future clinical studies with small molecules tar - geting Dyn2 . Several Dyn2 inhibitors under development for clinical use have been found to inhibit cell proliferation and cancer cell migration [ 32 , 33 ] . While this study clearly points out to FA dynamics being an important target for Dyn2 signaling in invasive PCA cancer cells , we cannot rule out the contribution of other mechanisms independent from Dyn2 - mediated FA turnover regulation . For instance , Dyn2 is critical for cell cycle progression and cell survival . As shown in our results , silencing Dyn2 in PCA cells reduced cell prolifera - tion . However , analysis of apoptosis using the Annexin assay revealed no impact of Dyn2 silencing on cell apop - tosis compared to control cells ( data not shown ) . More - over , Dyn2 is required for endocytosis of several oncogenic receptors such as EGFR and Her2 [ 34 , 35 ] , many of which have been implicated in prostate carcino - genesis . Dyn2 also regulates Golgi structure and vesicula - tion during the secretory process that can affect trafﬁcking of other signaling molecules involved in carci - nogenesis [ 8 ] . Finally , Dyn2 directly interacts with F - actin and actin dynamics , actin - associated proteins , molecules that induce or sense membrane curvature , as well as expression of angiogenic receptors , e . g . , vascular endothe - lial growth factor receptor 2 / Kinase insert domain recep - tor , in endothelial cells [ 36 , 37 ] , but future studies are required to delineate the impact of Dyn2 silencing on each of these mechanisms in progressive PCA . Taken together , this study provides a novel implication of Dyn2 signaling in PCA progression and support potential prog - nostic and therapeutic values of Dyn2 for advanced and hormone - refractory PCA .
