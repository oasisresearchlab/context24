Karger AG , Basel Introduction Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) is a complex neurodegenera - tive disorder affecting 1 – 2 % of individuals older than 65 years [ 1 ] . The characteristics of PD include the formation of Lewy bodies and a chronic profound loss of dopami - nergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta . The etiology of PD often involves multiple genetic and environmental exposures , as well as complex interactions in between [ 2 – 4 ] . Genetic factors are estimated to be re - sponsible for at least one fourth of the variations in PD liability , of which currently discovered factors are only counted for a small fraction ( 6 – 7 % ) [ 5 ] . Genome - wide association studies ( GWAS ) have led to breakthroughs in investigating the genetic susceptibility to PD [ 5 – 7 ] . Recently , 5 new variants were identified as PD - susceptible genes ( ACMSD , STK39 , MCCC1 / LAMP3 , Key Words CCDC62 · rs12817488 · PRDM2 · Parkinson’s disease · Genetic association Abstract It has been recently proposed by a genome - wide association study ( GWAS ) meta - analysis that the CCDC62 variant rs12817488 is a new risk locus associated with Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) . In this study , we aimed to investigate the asso - ciation between rs12817488 and PD in a Chinese cohort . A total of 341 PD patients and 423 matched controls were re - cruited in Eastern China . Our results showed that the A allele of rs12817488 was significantly associated with an aggravat - ed risk of PD ( p = 0 . 006 ) and represented a major allele in contrast to a minor one in Caucasians . Genotype distribu - tions also differed between PD patients and controls ( p = 0 . 011 for AA / AG / GG ) . Further analysis showed that the asso - ciation of rs12817488 with PD only existed in females . We also investigated the protein level of CCDC62 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 41 AA or GG carriers and found an apparently higher expression in PD patients carry - ing the AA genotype . A potential interaction was found be - tween two estrogen - related loci , i . e . rs12817488 / CCDC62 and rs2697962 / PRDM2 , particularly in the female stratum . In conclusion , our study demonstrated for the first time a sig - nificant association between the rs12817488 polymorphism Received : March 8 , 2013 Accepted : July 10 , 2013 Published online : December 4 , 2013 Jian - Hong Zhu , PhD Department of Preventive Medicine Wenzhou Medical University Wenzhou , Zhejiang 325035 ( China ) E - Mail jianhong . zhu @ gmail . com Xiong Zhang , MD , PhD Department of Neurology , Second Affiliated Hospital Wenzhou Medical University Wenzhou , Zhejiang 325000 ( China ) E - Mail zhangxiong98 @ gmail . com © 2013 S .

These newly identified loci were thereafter investigated in different populations , except for the variant rs12817488 of CCDC62 which was substi - tuted by a proxy SNP rs10847864 / HIP1R in these studies [ 6 , 9 , 10 ] . CCDC62 ( coiled - coil domain - containing pro - tein 62 ) , also named ERAP75 , is involved in estrogen re - ceptor activation and has been shown to play a role in cancer immunogenicity [ 11 , 12 ] . The CCDC62 variant in PD etiology has not been independently studied other than in the initial report . Indeed , estrogen and its recep - tors have been consistently suggested to play a role in PD development [ 13 – 18 ] . For example , the estrogen - related gene PRDM2 ( PR domain - containing 2 , with a ZNF do - main ) encodes a zinc finger protein that can bind to the estrogen receptor , and its variants such as rs2697962 were found in association with PD susceptibility , especially in the female stratum [ 17 ] . In this study , we aimed to inves - tigate the association between rs12817488 / CCDC62 and the risk of PD in a case - control cohort comprised of 764 individuals from mainland China , and to understand the potential interaction between two estrogen - related loci , i . e . rs12817488 / CCDC62 and rs2697962 / PRDM2 . Materials and Methods Subjects The study cohort was comprised of 341 sporadic PD patients ( 178 males and 163 females ) and 423 age - and gender - matched controls ( 226 males and 197 females ) of Han Chinese ethnicity from Eastern China . PD patients were examined and evaluated by two movement disorder neurologists and diagnosed as sporadic PD cases according to the clinical diagnostic criteria of the UK Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank [ 19 ] . Patients also under - went a neurological examination and were assessed using the Uni - fied Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) and the Hoehn - Yahr scale . Controls were volunteers determined to be free of neu - rological disorders based on medical history and physical and laboratory examinations . Patients with an age at onset < 55 years were defined as having early - onset PD , while others were de - scribed as having late - onset PD [ 20 ] . This study was performed with the approval of the ethics committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital , Wenzhou Medical University . Subjects participating in this study signed informed consent forms . Genotyping Genomic DNA samples were extracted from human periph - eral blood using a DNA blood mini - kit ( Tiangen , Beijing , China ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR - RFLP ) was used to analyze the alleles of rs12817488 and rs2697962 . In brief , the PCR reaction was performed using a mini - cycler PCR system ( Bio - Rad , California , USA ) . The reaction was done in a to - tal volume of 25 μl including 0 . 10 μg of genomic DNA , 12 . 5 μl of 2 × PCR Mastermix ( Tiangen ) , and 0 . 50 μ M of each primer ( table 1 ) . The procedure was as follows : initial denaturation at 94 ° C for 3 min , 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 ° C , 30 s at 60 ° C for rs12817488 ( or 56 ° C for rs2697962 ) , and 1 min at 72 ° C , and then a final exten - sion at 72 ° C for 5 min . The generated rs12817488 PCR product was digested with 5 units of SmaI ( Fermentas , USA ) with incuba - tion at 30 ° C for 4 h . The rs2697962 PCR product was digested with 5 units of Csp6I ( Fermentas ) with incubation at 37 ° C for 4 h . After digestion , the fragments were separated using 2 . 5 % agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and visualized under a gel imaging system . A 50 - bp DNA ladder ( Tiangen ) was used as a size marker . For the purpose of verification , 10 PCR samples were sent for di - rect sequencing and all of them showed results consistent with our enzymatic genotyping . Cell Isolation and Western Blot Two - milliliter peripheral venous blood samples were derived from PD patients and control individuals . Peripheral blood mono - nuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were isolated by centrifugation in lympho - cyte separation medium ( Haoyang Co . , Tianjin , China ) . Cells were then washed 3 times with phosphate - buffered saline and subjected to Western blot analysis as previously described [ 21 ] . Briefly , cells were lysed in sample buffer ( 60 m M Tris - HCl , pH 6 . 8 , 5 % glycerol , 2 % SDS ) and then boiled for 10 min . The protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit ( Beyotime , Shang - hai , China ) . The proteins were separated on a 10 % SDS - PAGE gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane which was blocked Table 1 .

The membrane was in - cubated overnight at 4 ° C with anti - CCDC62 ( Abcam , Hong Kong , China ) or anti - β - actin ( Cell Signaling , Boston , Mass . , USA ) pri - mary antibody followed by a secondary horseradish peroxidase - conjugated anti - rabbit antibody ( Cell Signaling ) for 1 h at room temperature . Blots were developed using enhanced chemilumines - cence ( LumiGLO ® Reagent and Peroxide ; Cell Signaling ) accord - ing to the manufacturer’s protocol . Data Analysis Data analysis was performed using the statistical package of Predictive Analytics Software 18 . 0 ( PASW , version 18 . 0 ) for Win - dows . Conformity with the Hardy - Weinberg equilibrium ( HWE ) expectation was evaluated separately in controls and cases using the χ 2 test . The Kolmogorov - Smirnov test was used as a normality test . The χ 2 test and the Wilcoxon rank test were then used to com - pare categorical variables and continuous variables , respectively . Odds ratios ( OR ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI ) were cal - culated to assess the relative risk conferred by a particular allele or genotype . Multiple logistic regression was used for interaction analysis . One - way ANOVA followed by post hoc comparison was used to assess the densitometric data from the Western blot . Two tailed p values < 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant . Results CCDC62 Variant rs12817488 Is Associated with PD Susceptibility The genotype frequencies of rs12817488 in controls and cases met the HWE expectation ( p > 0 . 05 ) . The char - acteristics of PD patients and controls are summarized in table 2 . The A allele of rs12817488 represented a major allele in this population , i . e . 58 . 1 % in cases and 51 . 1 % in controls . The frequency of the A allele was significantly higher ( p = 0 . 006 , OR 1 . 327 , 95 % CI 1 . 083 – 1 . 626 ) in PD patients than in controls . A statistical difference in geno - type distribution was also detected between PD patients and controls ( p = 0 . 011 for AA vs . AG vs . GG , and p = 0 . 003 for AA vs . AG + GG , OR 1 . 604 , 95 % CI 1 . 175 – 2 . 190 ) . Further analyses showed that significant differences in genotype distribution and in allele frequencies were only present in female PD patients ( p = 0 . 019 and p = 0 . 009 , OR 1 . 481 , 95 % CI 1 . 102 – 1 . 991 , respectively ) in compari - son with their respective controls ( table 3 ) . CCDC62 Expression in PBMCs Is Higher in PD Patients Carrying the AA Genotype In order to understand the impact of genetic variation on protein expression , we isolated PBMCs from a total of 41 PD patients and controls ( including 32 females and 9 males ) carrying the AA or GG genotype of rs12817488 ( fig . 1 c ) . Our analyses through Western blot and densito - metric quantification showed that the expression of CCDC62 was apparently higher in patients carrying the AA genotype ( 1 . 46 and 1 . 78 times higher , respectively , vs . controls carrying the AA or GG genotype , p < 0 . 05 ; 1 . 38 times higher vs . patients with the GG genotype , p = 0 . 082 ; fig . 1 ) . However , no significant difference was found be - tween the protein levels of all other genotypes . Genetic Interaction between Two Estrogen - Related Genes : CCDC62 and PRDM2 As stated earlier , we selected the PRDM2 variant rs2697962 to understand the genetic interaction between two estrogen - related genes . We first investigated the as - sociation of rs2697962 with PD in this population . The genotype frequencies of rs2697962 in controls and cases met the HWE expectation ( p > 0 . 05 ) . No statistical sig - nificance was found when comparing genotype and al - lele frequencies between the total PD patients and con - trols or between their matched gender subtypes ( table 4 ) . However , higher frequencies of the AA genotype or the minor allele A were detected in female PD patients com - pared to male patients ( p = 0 . 019 for AA vs . AG vs . GG , and p = 0 . 008 for A vs . G , OR 1 . 723 , 95 % CI 1 . 150 – 2 . 580 ; table 4 ) . We then investigated the possible genetic inter - action between rs12817488 / CCDC62 and rs2697962 / PRDM2 towards the risk of PD , and its potential gender liability . The interactions leading to a higher risk , with their statistical significance , are presented in table 5 . Our analysis in the overall samples showed that a simultane - ous presence of the AA genotype of rs12817488 and the A allele of rs2697962 conferred a moderately higher risk of PD ( OR 1 . 636 , 95 % CI 1 . 007 – 2 . 656 , p = 0 . 047 ; table 5 ) . Further analysis in female groups suggested that females carrying both the A allele of rs12817488 and the AA gen - Table 2 .

Discussion Of the 5 newly identified loci , the association between rs12817488 of CCDC62 and PD was first detected in the discovery phase , while in the replication stage a proxy SNP , i . e . rs10847864 in the HIP1R gene with linkage dis - equilibrium to rs12817488 ( r 2 = 0 . 85 ) , was used to com - pensate for probe design to reflect the signal of the initial locus [ 8 ] . The association of rs10847864 / HIP1R with PD was later confirmed by other groups [ 6 , 9 , 10 ] . In this study , we present the first direct evidence validating that rs12817488 / CCDC62 is associated with PD , wherein the A allele represents a risk factor for PD predisposition . It is noteworthy that PD patients carrying the AA geno - type displayed a higher expression of CCDC62 in PBMCs . Our study also demonstrated a potential genetic interac - tion between two estrogen - related loci , i . e . rs12817488 / CCDC62 and rs2697962 / PRDM2 . In the current Chinese population , we found that the A allele is a major allele of rs12817488 ( 54 . 2 % in all sub - jects ) , rather than a minor allele as reported in Caucasians ( 46 . 0 % ) [ 8 ] and in NCBI dbSNP ( 39 . 9 % ) , suggesting a dif - ferential presence of the variant’s allele frequencies across ethnicities . Interestingly , gender - stratified analysis dem - onstrated that the association of rs12817488 with PD ex - isted only in females , but not in males , suggesting an in - volvement of hormonal regulating factors . Indeed , exten - sive literature has reported a role of estrogen as well as its receptors in neuroprotection and PD susceptibility . As re - Table 3 .

CCDC62 Variant rs12817488 and the Risk of PD Eur Neurol 2014 ; 71 : 77 – 83 DOI : 10 . 1159 / 000354333 81 vealed in an epidemiological survey , a differential per - centage was present between genders in developing PD , i . e . 2 . 0 % for men and 1 . 3 % for women [ 22 ] . Further stud - ies demonstrated that oophorectomy and menopause were associated with an increased risk of PD , while post - menopausal estrogen replacement therapy reduced the risk of developing the disease [ 23 – 25 ] . Our results provide further evidence in support of the role of estrogen in PD as CCDC62 is an estrogen receptor - associated protein in - volved in the receptor’s activation [ 11 , 12 ] . Several other polymorphisms located in estrogen - related genes such as PRDM2 , ERβ , ESR1 , and CYP19A1 have also been related to a higher incidence of PD [ 13 , 14 , 17 ] . In line with evi - dence from human subjects , a role of estrogen in PD is also exhibited in animal studies , particularly with regard to es - trogen receptors [ 15 , 16 , 18 , 26 – 29 ] . For example , degen - eration of neuronal cell bodies was detected throughout the brain , including the substantia nigra , in ERβ knockout mice [ 26 ] . ERα agonist [ 27 ] and G protein - coupled estro - gen receptor 1 ( GPER1 ) [ 28 ] were shown to be neuropro - tective in an MPTP - induced mouse model of PD . We then isolated PBMCs from 41 subjects carrying AA or GG genotypes to understand the potential impact of rs12817488 on CCDC62 expression . In contrast to brain neuronal cells , human PBMCs represent a valuable source in the study of PD - related proteins due to their easy ac - Table 4 .

Our analysis of these cells demon - strated an apparently higher protein expression of CCDC62 in patients carrying the AA genotype . Assum - ing that activation of the estrogen receptor by CCDC62 is neuroprotective , as mentioned above , a higher CCDC62 expression in patients carrying the risk allele A may serve as a compensatory mechanism against PD development . We also searched regulatory elements in this locus ( exclu - sively binding to the site bearing either A or G ) , such as in http : / / mbs . cbrc . jp / research / db / TFSEARCH . html , in order to associate the variant signal with the protein level , but failed to find any . In fact , the final protein level re - flected by a specific genotype in PD patients and controls may require prior gene - gene and ( or ) gene - environment interactions [ 33 ] . Also , rs12817488 , located in the intron region of CCDC62 , may not be a true risk variant . The true one as tagged by rs12817488 may possibly be in re - gions a distance away [ 33 ] . In order to further understand the role of CCDC62 in PD susceptibility , we explored the potential interaction with another estrogen - related locus , i . e . rs2697962 / PRDM2 , which has been shown to be associated with PD , as well as in the female stratum [ 17 ] . Genotyping in the current cohort failed to yield a significant association with PD in the total subjects or in the female stratum ( p = 0 . 100 ) , which probably resulted from the underpowered subject volume . However , we found a significant differ - ence in A allele frequency between genders in PD cases , but not in controls , suggesting a potential gender liability of rs2697962 to PD predisposition . Interaction analysis demonstrated that the simultaneous presence of the AA genotype of rs12817488 and the A allele of rs2697962 led to a moderate increase in PD susceptibility and showed an aggravated risk of PD in females carrying both the A allele of rs12817488 and the AA genotype of rs2697962 , suggesting that a genetic interaction contributing to PD is present between these two estrogen - related genes . However , we admit that the testing power is limited given the small volume in each subgroup , and more subjects are needed for further validation . In conclusion , our study demonstrated a significant association between rs12817488 and sporadic PD with gender variations in a Chinese cohort . The allele frequen - cy of rs12817488 in Chinese subjects differed from that in Caucasians , and the protein expression of CCDC62 in PBMCs was higher in PD patients carrying the AA geno - type of rs12817488 . The locus displayed a potential inter - action with another estrogen - related locus , i . e . rs2697962 / PRDM2 . Our data confirmed the role of CCDC62 in PD predisposition and provided novel insight into the protein expression reflected by this variant , and its estro - gen - related genetic interaction in subjects of Chinese ethnicity .
