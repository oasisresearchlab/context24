H O L L Y A . W H I T E Thinking “Outside the Box” : Unconstrained Creative Generation in Adults with Attention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder Creative generation is structured around existing knowledge and task examples , yet overreliance on speciﬁc examples may limit imagination ( Ward , T . B . , Finke , R . A . , & Smith , S . M . , 1995 ) . The constraining inﬂuence of knowledge during creative generation may be offset by conceptual expansion , a process of thinking outside traditional conceptual boundaries , which may be heightened by distractibility and mild executive dysfunction ( Abraham , A . , Windmann , S . , Daum , I . , & G € unt € urk € un , O . , 2005 ) . The present study explored the constraining effects of knowledge in adults with Attention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) , a disorder characterized by impaired attention and inhibitory control ( Barkley , R . A . , 1997 ) . Col - lege students with and without ADHD were compared on two creative generation measures : an alien fruit invention task that required participants to imagine fruit that might exist on another planet ( Ward , T . B . , 1994 ) , and a product label invention task wherein the goal was to invent product names without using ele - ments of task examples ( Kray , L . J . , Galinski , A . D . & Wong , E . M . , 2006 ) . ADHD participants created alien fruit that diverged more from Earth fruit and labels that conformed less to examples , relative to non - ADHD peers . Results suggest that adults with ADHD may be less constrained by knowledge during creative genera - tion . Findings are discussed in terms of theoretical import and practical implications for individuals with ADHD .

A motto among creative designers , “Never start at square one if you can start at square two , ” refers to the wisdom of using old models to inspire new creations ( Goldschmidt , 2011 ) . This philosophy may be applied to creative endeavors in general ; whether elements of previous ideas or designs are deliberately re - used or just serve as inspiration , no creation is entirely new ( Ward , Finke & Smith , 1995 ) . Indeed , the appli - cation of old patterns to new designs , or the transfer of familiar structures to invention in unfamiliar domains , is illustrative of the role of analogical reasoning in creative endeavors ( Casakin & Goldschmidt , 2000 ; Ward , 2004 ) . The guiding inﬂuence of knowledge on creative generation , or “structured imagination” ( Finke , Ward & Smith , 1992 ) , is both efﬁcient and practical . Yet , knowledge may also limit creativity — thinking may get stuck or ﬁxated on a particular idea ( Finke et al . , 1992 ) . A real - world example is design ﬁxation , wherein the creative process is stunted by interference from a speciﬁc example or perspective ( Chrysikou & Weisberg , 2005 ) . In problem solving , prior exposure to old solutions may lead engineers to “ﬁxate” on the previous solutions and reuse them in ways that are less effective ( Jansson & Smith , 1991 ) . Experimental manipulations may reduce ﬁxation and the constraining effects of knowledge during creative generation , however ( Agogu (cid:2) e et al . , 2014 ; Chrysikou & Weisberg , 2005 ; Marsh , Landau & Hicks , 1996 ; Ward , Patterson & Sifonis , 2004 ) . Individuals also differ in the extent to which their imagination is struc - tured ( and thus constrained ) by prior knowledge during creative generation ( Abraham , Windmann , McKenna & G € unt € urk € un , 2007 ; Ward , Saunders & Dodds , 1999 ) . In particular , individuals with an overinclu - sive or chaotic cognitive style ( Eysenck , 1993 ; Finke , 1996 ) may be less inﬂuenced by task examples or prior knowledge during creative generation ( Abraham , Windmann , Daum & G € unt € urk € un , 2005 ; Abraham et al . , 2007 ) . The present study investigated structured imagination and creative generation in one such group of individuals : college students with Attention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) . The sections to follow provide a framework for this objective from a creative cognition perspective ( Ward et al . , 1995 ) . The Journal of Creative Behavior , Vol . 0 , Iss . 0 , pp . 1 – 12 © 2018 Creative Education Foundation DOI : 10 . 1002 / jocb . 382 1 STRUCTURED IMAGINATION AND CONFORMITY IN CREATIVE GENERATION Creative generation is guided by , and structured around , knowledge ( Finke et al . , 1992 ) . In the labora - tory , structured imagination is observable using the alien invention task ( Ward , 1994 ) . The goal of this task is to create a variant of known category ( e . g . , animal or fruit ) , which might exist on another planet . Typi - cally , participants ﬁrst think of a known Earth - example of the category , which they then modify in various ways ( Ward , 1994 ) . Creative generation tends to start with the most accessible information ( Finke et al . , 1992 ) . For instance , in the alien fruit task , participants are likely to draw inspiration from high frequency , typical of Earth fruits , such as apple or orange , which are easily retrieved from memory ( Ward & Wickes , 2009 ) . Thus , creative generation follows a path of least resistance by default ( Finke et al . , 1992 ) . The struc - turing inﬂuence of examples is often apparent in the resemblance between the creative product and its inspi - ration . Thus , alien fruit creations are likely to be juicy , sweet , and have seeds and a stem , because these features are typical of Earth fruit ( Ward , Patterson , Sifonis , Dodds & Saunders , 2002 ) . Similarly , an alien creature inspired by an Earth animal is likely to show typical animal characteristics , such as bilateral symmetry ( Ward , 1994 ) . In the absence of contextual information or task constraints , participants draw upon speciﬁc examples from memory during the alien creature invention task ( Ward , 1994 ) . In doing so , participants are likely to include more features typical of Earth animals . Yet , creations based on speciﬁc examples are less likely to include atypical features or attributes , and thus are lower in novelty ( Kray , Galinsky & Wong , 2006 ; Ward , 1994 ) . Likewise , alien fruits that are inspired by speciﬁc Earth fruits are judged as less original ( Ward et al . , 2002 ) . These studies demonstrate that when imagination is guided by knowledge , it may be constrained by that knowledge as well ( Ward et al . , 2002 ) . Yet , experimental manipulations of structured imagination tasks may impact participants’ reliance on speciﬁc examples during creative generation ( Ward , 1994 ; Ward et al . , 2004 ) . By altering the constraints of the alien creature invention task , Ward ( 1994 ) directed participants toward either ( a ) retrieval of speciﬁc Earth animal exemplars , or ( b ) use of broader knowledge structures . Participants in the second condition were less likely to base creatures on speciﬁc Earth animals , and more likely to include novel ( atypical ) features in their invented creatures ( Ward , 1994 ) . Novelty is also higher when participants are instructed to use their wildest imaginations ( Ward , 1994 ) or to consider factors that might impact survival on another planet ( Ward et al . , 2004 ) . In the alien fruit invention task , reliance on speciﬁc Earth fruit exemplars is lower for participants instructed to not be bound by what fruit is like on Earth , compared to participants instructed to simply be creative ( Ward et al . , 2002 ) . Thus , while creative generation tends to follows a path of least resistance by default , the creative approach is ﬂexible and may change in response to task demands ( Ward , 1994 ) . Creative generation is also inﬂuenced by recently activated knowledge in the form of task examples ( Smith , Ward & Schumacher , 1993 ) . Smith et al . ( 1993 ) showed participants three example toys prior to a toy invention task . Each of these toys included three critical features : a ball , an electronic device , and a high level of physical activity . The effect of the examples was striking — despite explicit instructions to create toys that were very different from examples , the majority of participants included the shared attributes of the task examples in their toy designs ( Smith et al . , 1993 ) . This tendency to retain features of examples in cre - ative products , dubbed the “conformity effect” ( Smith et al . , 1993 ) is a robust phenomenon that has been observed in multiple contexts , using various experimental stimuli ( Jansson & Smith , 1991 ; Kray et al . , 2006 ; Marsh , Ward & Landau , 1999 ) . Marsh et al . ( 1999 ) replicated the conformity effect using verbal materials , rather than visual . The product label invention task required participants to create labels for new products in each of three categories . In one condition , Marsh et al . ( 1999 ) provided task examples for each category which shared a common ending ( e . g . , pasta labels that ended in the letters “ni” — rotini , tortellini , rigatoni ) and instructed participants not to copy the examples . Nonetheless , participants exposed to task examples were more likely to include example endings in the labels they created ( Marsh et al . , 1999 ) . Like schemas and self - generated examples , task examples may limit creative generation , as evidenced by lower novelty and originality of designs ( Finke et al . , 1992 ; Kray et al . , 2006 ) . Nonetheless , conformity per se does not necessarily imply that the creative process has been compromised or that the end product will be suboptimal ( Marsh et al . , 1996 ) . In a study by Marsh et al . ( 1996 ) , participants were exposed to various types of task examples prior to completing the alien creature invention task . As predicted by the conformity hypothesis , participants’ designs included critical features of the examples , yet conformity had no effect on creative output , elaboration , or the inclusion of novel design features ( Marsh et al . , 1996 ) . In fact , partici - pants shown “artiﬁcial” examples ( e . g . , animals that possessed unusual feature pairings , such as claws and antennae ) invented alien creatures that were rated as more creative , relative to inventions in the standard 2 Unconstrained Creative Generation in ADHD example and control conditions ( Marsh et al . , 1996 ) . Notably , Marsh et al . ’s ( 1996 ) artiﬁcial examples were highly original , which likely inspired relatively creative designs . Similar ﬁndings have emerged in problem solving studies ; viewing unusual solutions prior a problem - solving task increases the originality of solutions ( Agogu (cid:2) e et al . , 2014 ; Perttula & Sipil € a , 2007 ) . In an effort to explain the basis of the ﬁxating versus inspiring ability of task examples , Agogu (cid:2) e et al . ( 2014 ) crafted example solutions that exposed participants to either new or redundant information prior to problem solving . “Restrictive” examples were solutions expected to be spontaneously activated during prob - lem solving , and therefore likely to reinforce the solver’s conceptual problem space ; “expansive” examples were solutions not expected to occur to the solver , and thus likely to widen the problem space . Agogu (cid:2) e et al . ( 2014 ) observed that restrictive examples reduced the originality of participants’ solutions , while expansive examples increased originality . On the basis of these ﬁndings , Agogu (cid:2) e et al . ( 2014 ) concluded that the inﬂu - ence of a task example was determined by its effect on the solver’s conceptual problem space ; examples that widened the problem space increased originality , whereas examples that restricted or narrowed the problem space led to ﬁxation ( Agogu (cid:2) e et al . , 2014 ) . Studies that have varied parameters of creative generation and problem - solving tasks yield valuable infor - mation about conditions under which knowledge is more ( or less ) likely to constrain creativity . In the con - text of recently activated knowledge , unoriginal task examples are more likely to lead to ﬁxation , and unusual task examples promote originality ( Agogu (cid:2) e et al . , 2014 ; Marsh et al . , 1996 ; Perttula & Sipil € a , 2007 ) . Another way to reduce ﬁxation is to interrupt the processes involved in structured imagination ; this may be accomplished by adding an additional constraint , thereby blocking the path of least resistance ( Landau & Leynes , 2004 ) . Youmans ( 2011 ) asked participants to complete a secondary task while viewing potentially ﬁxating information ; in this case , participants were too distracted to be inﬂuenced by the example in the ﬁrst place . In a structured imagination task , such as the alien creature invention task , examples are retrieved from memory and creative generation is guided by participants’ schemas ( Ward , 1994 ) . Reliance on self - gen - erated examples can nonetheless be reduced , by encouraging an abstract approach ( Ward , 1994 ) or varying instructions or task constraints in such a way that reliance on easily accessible or high frequency informa - tion is not a viable option ( Ward , 1994 ; Ward et al . , 2004 ) . Collectively , these studies suggest that the con - straining inﬂuence of knowledge during creative generation may be reduced by : ( a ) increasing conceptual expansion , and / or ( b ) disrupting the default path of least resistance or distracting from relevant information . As it happens , individual differences in cognitive processing may affect creative generation in much the same way ( Finke , 1996 ) . CHAOTIC , DIVERGENT PROCESSES IN CREATIVE GENERATION : THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX The tendency to rely on knowledge during creative cognition may be universal , yet individuals differ in the degree to which they are constrained by knowledge during creative generation . Finke and Bettle ( 1996 ) describe two contrasting styles — ordered and chaotic — which are likely to impact structured imagination in opposite ways . Ordered cognition is linear , organized , and goal - directed ( Finke & Bettle , 1996 ) . In the con - text of creative generation , ordered thinkers demonstrate a high degree of structure and connectedness to previous ideas and models ( Finke , 1996 ) . In contrast , the disorganized , spontaneous , and relatively unstruc - tured style of chaotic cognition is likely to foster imaginative divergence , rather than structural connected - ness ( Finke , 1996 ; Finke & Bettle , 1996 ) . In many ways , chaotic cognition resembles the overinclusive processing style described by Eysenck ( 1993 ) . According to Eysenck ( 1993 ) , individuals differ in scope of perceived conceptual relevance , and people who deﬁne relevance more widely have an overinclusive process - ing style . In Eysenck’s ( 1993 ) model , inclusiveness of processing is a key aspect of creative ideation . By vir - tue of broadly focused attention and conceptual activation , overinclusive thinkers are able to bring multiple ideas into close proximity , which facilitates original creative thinking ( Eysenck , 1993 ) . Eysenck ( 1993 ) pre - dicted an overlap between the overinclusive processing style , trait psychoticism , and originality in divergent thinking , which was conﬁrmed in later research ( Acar & Runco , 2012 ; Eysenck , 1994 ) . In the context of cre - ative generation , people with an overinclusive processing style may engage in relatively high conceptual expansion , a process whereby traditional conceptual boundaries are extended ( Ward , 1994 ) . Abraham et al . ( 2005 ) tested this hypothesis by comparing individuals with high trait psychoticism ( high — P ) and individu - als with low trait psychoticism ( low — P ) on the alien creature invention task . As predicted , high - P individu - als showed higher conceptual expansion on this task , as evidenced by the invention of alien creations that deviated more from Earth animals ( e . g . , lacked bilateral symmetry ) compared to the creatures invented by low - P participants . Abraham et al . ( 2005 ) argued that the higher conceptual expansion in the high - P group 3 Journal of Creative Behavior was attributable to low latent inhibitory control and weaker top - down knowledge constraints . Abraham et al . ’s ( 2005 ) ﬁndings suggest that the overinclusive , chaotic thinking associated with trait psychoticism may be beneﬁcial for conceptual expansion during creative generation . Chaotic cognition may likewise increase the ability to overcome the constraining effects of recently acti - vated knowledge during creative generation ( Abraham & Windmann , 2008 ; Abraham et al . , 2007 ; Eysenck , 1993 ; Finke & Bettle , 1996 ) . The information provided by task examples during creative generation is highly relevant and therefore not easily ignored ( Abraham et al . ( 2007 ) . Under these circumstances , attentional ﬂuctuations and distractibility may give chaotic thinkers an edge ( Eysenck , 1993 ; Finke & Bettle , 1996 ) . Studies of creative generation have found lower conformity to task examples among individuals with trait schizotypy ( Abraham et al . , 2007 ) , patients with schizophrenia ( Abraham & Windmann , 2008 ) , and children with ADHD ( Abraham , Windmann , Siefen , Daum & G € unt € urk € un , 2006 ) . Distractible individuals , such as children with ADHD , may be able to disregard salient knowledge by virtue of spontaneous activity in the default mode network ( DMN ) , a group of structures deactivated during goal - directed activity ( Beaty , Bene - dek , Silvia & Schacter , 2016 ) . Spontaneous activity in the DMN causes micro - lapses in attention which interfere with goal - directed activity ( Sonuga - Barke & Castellanos , 2007 ) . In theory , these disruptions might also destabilize active knowledge patterns or distract from relevant examples during creative generation tasks , thereby reducing the constraining inﬂuence of knowledge on imagination . CREATIVE COGNITION IN ADHD ADHD is a neurological condition marked by distractibility , impulsivity , and hyperactivity that affects children and adults ( American Psychiatric Association , 2013 ) . ADHD is associated with deﬁcits in attention , inhibitory control , and motivational regulation ( Barkley , 1997 ; Castellanos & Aoki , 2016 ; Nigg , 2001 ; Sonuga - Barke & Castellanos , 2007 ; Sonuga - Barke , Sergeant , Nigg & Willcutt , 2008 ) . The cognitive proﬁle of ADHD , while detrimental to activities which require organized , linear cognition , may nonetheless be beneﬁ - cial for some aspects of creative cognition ( Abraham et al . , 2006 ; White & Shah , 2006 , 2011 , 2016 ) . In par - ticular , adults with ADHD may be more original and innovative during divergent thinking ( White & Shah , 2006 , 2016 ) and may show higher levels of creative achievement ( White & Shah , 2011 ) . Creative cognition in ADHD may be partially attributable to deﬁcits in executive inhibitory control ( White & Shah , 2006 ) . This is consistent with the “less is more” role of prefrontal function in certain creative processes ( Thompson - Schill , Ramscar & Chrysikou , 2009 ) . Neuroimaging studies have identiﬁed brain networks common to ADHD pathology ( Castellanos & Proal , 2012 ; Castellanos et al . , 2008 ) and creative cognition ( Beaty et al . , 2016 ) . Of particular relevance to creative generation is inefﬁcient suppression of the default mode network , which has been linked to divergent creative thinking ( Takeuchi et al . , 2011 ) as well as ADHD ( Fassbender et al . , 2009 ; Sonuga - Barke & Castellanos , 2007 ) . More broadly , creative differences related to ADHD may be framed in terms of chaotic cognition ( Finke & Bettle , 1996 ; White & Shah , 2006 ) . Like other chaotic thinkers , adults with ADHD are impulsive ( Barkley , 1997 ) , score high on divergent thinking measures ( White & Shah , 2006 , 2011 ) , prefer the idea generation phase of problem solving over clariﬁcation and development ( White & Shah , 2011 ) , and ﬁnd unusual uses for common , everyday objects ( White & Shah , 2006 ) . In a recent study , adults with ADHD produced responses that were less semantically related to cues on a word association task , compared to non - ADHD peers ( White & Shah , 2016 ) . Thus , adults with ADHD have a relatively wide scope of perceived relevance , as operationally deﬁned by Eysenck ( 1993 ) . On a cell phone feature invention task , White and Shah ( 2016 ) found that adults with ADHD invented features in more categories , compared to non - ADHD peers , and this difference was statistically mediated by semantic distance of responses on the word association test . White and Shah ( 2016 ) also found higher novelty for ADHD participants , compared to non - ADHD participants , as evidenced by invented features that diverged more from existing technology . These ﬁndings align with the predictions of Eysenck’s ( 1993 ) model of creativity and overinclusive processing , and are consistent with greater imaginative divergence in adults with ADHD ( White & Shah , 2016 ) . By logical extension , ADHD might be expected to protect against the constraining effects of schema and self - generated examples during creative generation . Yet , Abraham et al . ( 2006 ) found no evidence of differ - ences in conceptual expansion between adolescents with and without ADHD on the alien creature invention task . The null ﬁnding may have been due to a ﬂoor effect , however ; as all participants in Abraham et al . ( 2006 ) scored low in conceptual expansion , relative to non - ADHD adults in another study that used the same task and scoring protocol ( Abraham et al . , 2005 ) . The measurement technique may not have been ideal for assessing conceptual expansion ; Abraham et al . ( 2006 ) used an aggregate measure that combined 4 Unconstrained Creative Generation in ADHD the presence of atypical features with a lack of typical features . However , studies have found ceiling effects for inclusion of typical features ( e . g . , Kray et al . , 2006 ; Ward , 1994 ) ; in fact , even creatively gifted individu - als are likely to include central attributes in their creations ( Ward et al . , 1999 ) . Conceptual expansion may be more associated with the inclusion atypical features , rather than the exclusion of typical features . Previous research has linked ADHD to divergent thinking ( White & Shah , 2006 , 2011 ) , which is a critical element of creative cognition ( Ward et al . , 1995 ) . Yet , two aspects of creative cognition that have not been adequately assessed in ADHD are conceptual expansion and overcoming knowledge constraints ( Abraham , 2014 ; Abraham & Windmann , 2007 ) . Neuroimaging research suggests that these components of creative cognition are dissociable from one another and from divergent thinking in terms of underlying pathways in the brain ( Abraham , 2014 ) . Overcoming knowledge constraints has been explored in the context of creative generation for children with ADHD , and in fact ADHD is associated with lower conformity to task exam - ples ( Abraham et al . , 2006 ) . Presumably , this advantage is related to distractibility , which may stem from DMN - interference ( Abraham et al . , 2006 ; Sonuga - Barke & Castellanos , 2007 ) . Yet , this phenomenon has not been examined in adults with ADHD , nor has the appropriateness of creations been evaluated in the context of a recently activated knowledge task for individuals with ADHD ( in children or adults ) . Presumably by virtue of low latent inhibition and an overinclusive processing , individuals with high trait psychoticism show greater conceptual expansion during creative generation ( Abraham et al . , 2005 ) . Adults with ADHD also have low latent inhibition ( White , 2007 ) and an overinclusive processing style ( White & Shah , 2016 ) , and should thus be less inﬂuenced by schemas and self - generated examples during creative generation . Abraham et al . ( 2006 ) did not ﬁnd higher conceptual expansion among children with ADHD , perhaps due to ﬂoor effects and / or the young age of participants . Thus , the question of conceptual expansion in ADHD is yet unresolved . THE PRESENT STUDY The unique neurological proﬁle associated with ADHD may protect against the constraining effects of knowledge during creative generation . Yet , with the exception of the study by Abraham et al . ( 2006 ) , this hypothesis remains virtually untested . The present research addressed this gap by examining the well - estab - lished phenomena of structured imagination and conformity to task examples during creative generation in a sample of college students with and without ADHD . To this end , participants completed two creative gen - eration tasks . The ﬁrst was the alien fruit task , which required participants to draw and describe fruit that might exist on a planet very different from Earth ( Ward et al . , 1999 , 2002 ) . Participants were instructed to be as “creative and unusual as possible , ” which emphasized the creativity objective of the task ( Ward et al . , 2002 ) . To create something unlike Earth fruit , participants would be compelled to think outside the tradi - tional boundaries associated with the category “fruit . ” Evidence of this conceptual expansion is indicated by presence of atypical features ( features that are not typical of Earth fruit ) in alien fruit creations ( Ward et al . , 1999 ) . The ADHD group was expected to show greater conceptual expansion , as indicated by the inclusion of more atypical features on the structured imagination task , relative to the non - ADHD group . The cre - ations of the ADHD were also expected to be rated as more original , relative to the non - ADHD group , con - sistent with previous studies ( White & Shah , 2006 , 2011 ) . The second creative generation task was the product label invention task ( Kray et al . , 2006 ; Marsh et al . , 1999 ) . This task required participants to invent labels for new products without using elements of the exam - ples provided . On this task , overcoming knowledge constraints is indicated by lower conformity to task examples . The ADHD group in the present study was expected to include fewer elements of the task exam - ples compared to the non - ADHD group ; indicative of lower conformity during creative generation for indi - viduals with ADHD . In addition , the present study measured the appropriateness of the product label inventions by rating the descriptiveness of invented labels . Past research suggests a trade - off between exclud - ing example endings and descriptiveness ratings ( Kray et al . , 2006 ) , yet White and Shah ( 2016 ) found that adults with and without ADHD generated equally appropriate cell phone features despite the higher novelty of features in the ADHD group . Thus , no predictions were made regarding possible group differences in label descriptiveness for the present study . METHOD PARTICIPANTS Participants were undergraduate students at the University of Memphis ( N = 52 ) enrolled in Introduc - tory Psychology . The ADHD group ( n = 26 ) included equal numbers of males and females , and half of the 5 Journal of Creative Behavior ADHD participants were taking stimulant medication at the time of the study . The non - ADHD group ( n = 26 ) was also equal in gender composition . The ADHD and non - ADHD groups were similar in age ( M = 20 . 4 , SD = 3 . 09 ; M = 20 . 9 , SD = 3 . 65 ; ADHD and non - ADHD groups , respectively ) , as well as with respect to scores on the ACT 1 ( M = 22 . 5 , SD = 3 . 49 ; M = 21 . 8 , SD = 3 . 96 ; ADHD and non - ADHD , respectively ) . PARTICIPANT RECRUITMENT PROCEDURE For participant recruitment purposes , a preliminary questionnaire was administered to approximately 800 students enrolled in Introductory Psychology at the University of Memphis as part of a large pre - screen - ing session in which multiple researchers were recruiting participants for various studies . The questionnaire contained items from Barkley and Murphy’s ( 1998 ) Current Symptoms Scale , as well as questions asking whether the individual had ever been clinically diagnosed with ADHD or any attention deﬁcit disorder , and if so , whether the diagnosis had been conﬁrmed by a clinician within the past 6 months . Of the pre - screen - ing group , 48 ( ~ 6 % ) reported a diagnosis of ADHD and scored above the clinical threshold of the Current Symptoms Scale . Of the students who are qualiﬁed for the ADHD group on the basis of the initial screen - ing , 28 agreed to participate in the study ; of these potential participants , two students were excluded from the study due to comorbid psychiatric conditions ( major depressive disorder , generalized anxiety disorder ) , which yielded a ﬁnal sample of 26 participants for the ADHD group . 2 An equal number of participants for the non - ADHD sample were drawn randomly from a large pool of candidates from the same subject pool , all of whom scored below the clinical threshold on the Current Symptoms Scale and reported no personal or family history of an attention deﬁcit disorder , learning disability , or mood disorder . A second self - report measure , the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales , Screening Version ( CAARS - S - SV ; Conners , Erhardt & Sparrow , 1999 ) , was administered during the experimental session to conﬁrm reliability of self - reported ADHD symptoms . Scores on the CAARS - S - SV were in the clinical range for the ADHD group , and in the nonclinical range for the non - ADHD group . MATERIALS Current and Childhood ADHD Symptoms Rating Scales The Current and Childhood ADHD Symptoms Rating Scales ( Barkley & Murphy , 1998 ) are brief , self - report screening questionnaires for assessment of adult ADHD . Questionnaire items reﬂect diagnostic crite - ria for ADHD as per the DSM - IV . These scales have high reliability and scale validity as indicated by signiﬁ - cant correlations between self - report and spouse / parent ratings ( Barkley & Murphy , 1998 ) . Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scale , Screening Version The CAARS - S - SV ( Conners et al . , 1999 ) is a self - report measure of adult ADHD based on current scien - tiﬁc understanding of ADHD symptoms in adulthood . The CAARS - S - SV measures four dimensions : Inat - tention / Executive Function , Hyperactivity / Restlessness , Impulsivity / Emotional Lability , and Problems with Self - Concept ( Conners et al . , 1999 ) . Alien fruit creation task Conceptual expansion was assessed via a creative generation task adapted from previous studies ( Ward et al . , 1999 , 2002 ) . Task instructions were similar to the creative condition of Ward et al . ( 2002 ) ; partici - pants were told : “In this task , you will be asked to imagine , draw , and describe fruit that might exist on another planet that is very different from Earth . Be as creative and unusual as you can , and try not to dupli - cate fruit that exists on Earth . You will have 20 minutes to complete this activity . ” Conceptual expansion was measured using a procedure adapted from previous studies ( Abraham et al . , 2006 ; Kray et al . , 2006 ) . Two undergraduate research assistants , blind to participant condition and not involved in data collection , referred to the visual depiction and verbal description provided for each creation to determine the presence of parts ( seeds / pits , stems ) and properties ( sweet , juicy ) typical of Earth fruit ( Tversky & Hemenway , 1984 ; Ward et al . , 1999 ) , and atypical features , deﬁned as parts or properties that are absent or extremely rare in 1 The ACT college readiness assessment is a standardized achievement test used for college admissions in the United States . Scores range from 1 to 36 , with a national average score of 21 . 2 Due to strict inclusion criteria , the ﬁnal sample size ( n = 26 ) fell short of the 28 participants per group recommended by a power analysis via G * Power software ( Faul , Erdfelder , Lang & Buchner , 2007 ) , but the relative purity of the groups likely increased the sensitivity of ADHD / non - ADHD group comparisons . 6 Unconstrained Creative Generation in ADHD any variety of known Earth fruit . Atypical features were clustered into the following categories : ( a ) unusual appendages ( e . g . , hand , straw ) , ( b ) sensory organs ( e . g . , tongue , eyeball ) , ( c ) actions ( e . g . , lava shooting ; combustible ) , and ( d ) effects on consumer ( e . g . , X - ray vision ) . For scoring purposes , typicality was the sum of typical features ( 0 – 4 ) and atypicality was the sum of atypical clusters ( 0 – 4 ) . To evaluate originality , two research assistants who were blind to condition and hypothesis judged each creation’s resemblance to Earth fruit on a 5 - point scale ( lower scores indicated greater similarity to Earth fruit ) . Agreement between raters was high ( a = . 899 , p < . 0001 ) . Rater disagreements were resolved by obtaining a third rating and selecting the median . Product label invention task The constraining effect of recently activated knowledge ( task examples ) was examined via a product label invention task adapted from Kray et al . ( 2006 ) . Participants were instructed as follows : “Imagine that you are a consultant for an advertising agency , and you’ve been asked to create names for three new products . Please create a name for each new product . You will see a list of examples for each category , but please do NOT use or copy any aspects of the examples provided . You will have 10 minutes to complete this task . ” The same instructions also appeared at the top of the task sheet , which listed the three categories ( pain relievers , nuclear elements , and pasta ) and for each category , six examples . Within each of the three cate - gories , the labels shared two common endings ( a letter or group of letters ) . For pain reliever , the examples were : Tylenol , Anacin , Aspirin , Bufferin , Panadol , and Midol ( common endings - ol , - in ) . Nuclear element examples were radon , plutonium , argon , carbon , radium , and uranium ( - on , - ium ) . Pasta label examples were spaghetti , lasagna , fettuccini , rotini , pastina , and rigatoni ( - i , - a ) . Conformity to examples was deﬁned as the presence of an example ending in the label invention for the corresponding category ( e . g . , an invented pasta label ending in the letter “a” ) . For each participant , the conformity score was the total number of label inventions that included an example ending . The appropriateness of label inventions was also evaluated by two undergraduate research assistants ( blind to condition ) , using a procedure adapted from Kray et al . ( 2006 ) . Each response was rated on a 5 - point scale , according to how well it revealed the product type ( pasta , pain reliever , and nuclear element ) . A higher value indicated that the label was more descriptive of product category . For instance , the responses “Pastanoodlini” and “Zigganoodles” were rated as very descriptive of the category pasta . Intra - class correlation coefﬁcient indicated that raters were reliable ( a = . 886 , p < . 0001 ) . In the event of rater disagreement , a third rater was consulted and the median value was taken . For each participant , the descriptiveness score was the median rating across the three product categories . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE After providing informed consent , participants completed the alien fruit creation task and the product label task . Tasks were administered by research assistants who were blind to the condition of participants in an order counter - balanced across subjects . After the creative generation tasks , participants completed the CAARS - S - SV ( ADHD rating scales ) . RESULTS For each creative generation task , performance of the ADHD and non - ADHD groups was compared via independent - samples t - tests . To control the family wise error rate , Holm’s sequential Bonferroni method was applied to interpret statistical signiﬁcance ( Holm , 1979 ) . The overall alpha level was set at . 05 for each set of comparisons . For the alien fruit creation task , the variables of originality , typical features , and atypical features were compared as a function of ADHD group . This yielded reliable differences for originality , with the creations of the ADHD group rated as more original ( M = 3 . 387 , SD = 0 . 983 ) compared to the non - ADHD group ( M = 2 . 77 , SD = 0 . 908 ) , t ( 50 ) = (cid:1) 2 . 35 , p = . 023 ( d = 0 . 645 ) . The ADHD group also included more atypical features ( M = 1 . 65 , SD = 0 . 977 ) , relative to the non - ADHD group ( M = 0 . 654 , SD = 0 . 629 ) , t ( 50 ) = (cid:1) 4 . 39 , p < . 001 ( d = 1 . 22 ) . Typical features did not reliably differ between the ADHD group ( M = 2 . 46 , SD = 1 . 27 ) and the non - ADHD group ( M = 2 . 81 , SD = 1 . 17 ) , t ( 50 ) = 1 . 02 , p = . 311 ( d = 0 . 287 ) . A second set of analyses for the product label invention task revealed that the labels created by the ADHD group included fewer task examples endings ( M = 1 . 31 , SD = 1 . 12 ) , compared to the non - ADHD group ( M = 2 . 08 , SD = 0 . 891 ) , t ( 50 ) = 2 . 74 , p = . 009 ( d = 0 . 760 ) . The category descriptiveness of the labels did not reliably differ between the ADHD group ( M = 2 . 96 , SD = 0 . 824 ) and the non - ADHD group ( M = 3 . 08 , SD = 0 . 845 ) , t ( 50 ) = 0 . 499 , p = . 620 ( d = 0 . 144 ) ( Figure 1 ) . 7 Journal of Creative Behavior DISCUSSION The present study tested the hypothesis that adults with ADHD would be less constrained by prior and recently activated knowledge during creative generation , relative to non - ADHD peers . The potential effect of prior knowledge was evaluated via the alien fruit task , wherein participants were asked to draw and describe fruit that might exist on a planet very different from Earth ( Ward et al . , 2002 ) . Participants were explicitly instructed to be as creative and unusual as possible . This was intended to encourage conceptual expansion ( thinking beyond traditional deﬁnition of “fruit” ) . To the extent that participants were constrained by prior knowledge of fruit schema , their creations were expected to include fewer atypical features and more closely resemble Earth fruit , as indicated by lower originality . As predicted , the ADHD group created alien fruit that was rated as more original and included more atypical features , relative to the non - ADHD group . To evalu - ate the effect of recently activated knowledge , participants were asked to invent labels for new products in speciﬁc categories . Examples were provided for each category , and participants were instructed to avoid copying any aspect of the task examples . The labels created by ADHD participants included fewer endings of task examples , compared to labels invented by non - ADHD participants ; yet , the descriptiveness of labels did not differ between groups . The lack of conformity to task examples in the ADHD group was consistent with predictions and , together with results from the alien fruit task , supported the hypothesis that individu - als with ADHD are less likely to be constrained by knowledge during creative generation . The present ﬁndings are broadly consistent with previous research ; adults with ADHD were more origi - nal on the alien fruit task , consistent with ﬁndings of higher originality on divergent thinking measures for ADHD individuals ( White & Shah , 2006 , 2016 ) . The present study also found support for higher conceptual expansion among adults with ADHD , in contrast to Abraham et al . ’s ( 2006 ) ﬁnding for adolescents with ADHD . Yet , unlike Abraham et al . ( 2006 ) , the present study did not use a composite index of conceptual expansion ; previous studies suggested that atypical features are more indicative of creative performance than typical features , given that the latter are often associated with ceiling effects ( Kray et al . , 2006 ; Ward et al . , 1999 ) . Interestingly , the ADHD participants in the present study mirrored the performance of gifted adoles - cents in a study by Ward et al . ( 1999 ) ; like the ADHD group in the present study , gifted adolescents in FIGURE 1 . Sample of alien fruits created by non - ADHD and ADHD groups . ADHD , Attention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder . 8 Unconstrained Creative Generation in ADHD Ward et al . ( 1999 ) designed alien fruits that were higher in originality and atypical features , yet similar in typical features , relative to a comparison group . Ward et al . ( 1999 ) suggested that typical features ( e . g . , seeds ) may have been viewed as required to meet task objectives . Presumably , participants in the present study included typical features for the same reason ; to indicate that the creation was indeed a fruit . This ﬁnding is notable , because it suggests that individuals with ADHD were able to be creative while staying within task parameters . The creative generation tasks in the present study were intended to tap dissociable elements of creative cognition : conceptual expansion ( alien fruit task ) and the ability to overcome the constraining effects of recently activated knowledge ( product label task ) during creative generation ( Abraham , 2014 ) . These ele - ments , along with divergent thinking , are critical components of creative cognition ( Abraham & Windmann , 2007 ) . The present ﬁndings are therefore an important addition to the literature describing creative cogni - tion in adults with ADHD . More generally , there may be an advantage of chaotic , unstructured cognition in creative generation ; studies have demonstrated an increased ability to overcoming the constraining inﬂuence of task examples in children with ADHD ( Abraham et al . , 2006 ) , individuals high in trait schizotypy ( Abra - ham et al . , 2007 ) , and patients with schizophrenia ( Abraham & Windmann , 2008 ) . Moreover , this common - ality may have shared neurological underpinning ; interference from the default mode network ( Sonuga - Barke & Castellanos , 2007 ) . Nonetheless , overinclusive thinking that overly overinclusive may not yield viable , practical ideas ( Eysenck , 1993 ) . The goal of “creative realism” requires a balance between the structured and chaotic elements of creative thinking ( Finke , 1996 ) . In the present study , ADHD participants created alien fruits that met implicit and deﬁnitional criteria for the category fruit , yet demonstrated imaginative divergence and originality . On the product label invention task , ADHD participants created labels that conformed less to task examples , yet were equally descriptive of product type , compared to labels invented by non - ADHD participants . More - over , past research suggests that adults with ADHD are able to invent practical features in a realistic task of creative generation ( White & Shah , 2016 ) . Thus , the relatively mild chaos associated with ADHD may be divergent , but not overly so . Of course , an idea for a product is not the same as an actual creative product ( Ward , 2004 ) . According to the creative cognitive model , ideas represent “preinventive forms” which require transformational pro - cesses in order to manifest as an actual ﬁnished product ( Ward , 2004 ; Ward et al . , 1995 ) . The later stages of the creative process are likely to require patience and delayed gratiﬁcation ; yet , individuals with ADHD tend to be motivated by immediate reward ( Sonuga - Barke et al . , 2008 ) . Hence , people with ADHD may be less interested in the development or implementation of their creative ideas . In fact , research suggests that indi - viduals with ADHD prefer the ideation ( brainstorming ) phase of the creative process over clariﬁcation of the problem space or development of ideas ( White & Shah , 2011 ) . Nonetheless , idea generation is inherently valuable ; perhaps the chaotic mind of an ADHD person paired with the structured mind of an ordered thin - ker would create synergy in the context of a joint project . Studies show that exposure to creative examples and solutions may heighten originality in the context of creative generation and problem solving ( Agogu (cid:2) e et al . , 2014 ; Marsh et al . , 1996 ; Perttula & Sipil € a , 2007 ) . Might a person with ADHD inﬂuence the creativity of others , perhaps by widening conceptual space or disrupting the default structured approach to creative generation ? Perhaps adults with ADHD could be creative catalysts in the workplace . While these are empiri - cal questions , they are exciting possibilities that might be explored in future research . LIMITATIONS The present research has exciting potential theoretical and practical implications , but there are limita - tions that affect the interpretation and application of these ﬁndings . Primarily , the small sample size limited the power of this study and may have increased the risk of error . Thus , results should be viewed as prelimi - nary . The relative purity of the present sample is both a strength and limitation of the present design ; the lack of comorbidity and relatively high functioning participants in the ADHD group may have allowed for ADHD - related creative strengths to emerge , yet these ﬁndings may not generalize to all adults with ADHD . Adults with comorbid psychiatric conditions , learning difﬁculties , or more severe executive impairment were not represented in the current study . Moreover , the college students in the present study were relatively high functioning and may have possessed above - average intellect ; this is noteworthy , because the link between disinhibition and originality may be positively affected by intelligence ( Benedek , Franz , Heene & Neubauer , 2012 ) . Importantly , the present ﬁndings may not apply to individuals who are more clinically impaired ( Paek , Abdulla & Cramond , 2016 ) . Finally , the creative generation tasks included in the present study were 9 Journal of Creative Behavior relatively simple and open - ended ; perhaps complex problems or constrained tasks would increase reliance on task examples ( Perttula & Sipil € a , 2007 ) . Replication with a wider variety of measures and participants is recommended . CONCLUSION The results of this study provide further evidence that ADHD may be advantageous for certain types of creative thinking ; speciﬁcally , divergent , unconstrained creative cognition . Future research might explore the potential contribution of the chaotic ADHD mind in the workplace . Research suggests that individual cre - ativity is more likely to manifest as organizational creativity when leadership supports a culture of innova - tion ( Stempﬂe , 2011 ) , and many of the most innovation companies actively encourage “outside the box” thinking ( Basadur , Runco & Vega , 2000 ) . By leveraging ADHD - related strengths and providing the necessary structure and support ( Gupta & Singhal , 1993 ) , individuals and organizations alike may be able to unlock the imaginative and innovative potential of the ADHD mind .
