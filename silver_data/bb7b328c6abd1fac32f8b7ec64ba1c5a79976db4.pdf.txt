This study defines a tubular membrane clathrin - independent endocytic network , induced with the calmodulin inhibitor W13 , for β 1 - integrin internalization . This pathway is dependent on increased phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) levels and dynamin activity at the plasma membrane . Exogenous addition of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 or phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase ( PIP5K ) expression mimicked W13 - generated - tubules which are inhibited by active Rac1 . Therefore , the molecular mechanisms downstream of Rac1 , that controls this plasma membrane tubulation , were analyzed biochemically and by the expression of different Rac1 mutants . The results indicate that phospholipase C and ROCK1 are the main Rac1 effectors that impair plasma membrane invagination and tubule formation , essentially by decreasing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels and promoting cortical actomyosin assembly respectively . Interestingly , among the plethora of proteins that participate in membrane remodeling , this study revealed that ROCK1 , the well - known downstream RhoA effector , has an important role in Rac1 regulation of actomyosin at the cell cortex . This study provides new insights into Rac1 functioning on plasma membrane dynamics combining phosphatidylinositides and cytoskeleton regulation . Endocytosis is an essential process for eukaryotic cells to internalize growth factors , hormones , and nutrients from the plasma membrane ( PM ) or extracellular fluid 1 – 4 . The internalization routes can be classified into clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( CDE ) and clathrin - independent endocytosis pathways ( CIE ) 2 , 5 – 9 . CIE pathways include different ways of internalization which show high complexity , though all generally share their association with PM microdomains enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids 10 – 13 . The molecular machinery that reg - ulates these different routes is only now beginning to emerge . In comparison with CDE pathways , the morpho - logical features of membrane carriers generated by CIE pathways range from small vesicles to membrane tubular networks of different size and extension 9 , 11 , 14 – 16 . Several laboratories , including ours , have recently described the existence of PM tubular networks belong - ing to CIE pathways , with tubules of tens of micrometers in length 11 , 15 , 17 . Major histocompatibility complex I ( MHCI ) has been reported to be internalized via Arf6 - dependent , clathrin and caveolae - independent endo - cytosis 18 , and both MHCI and Arf6 were detected in tubules that lack the CDE marker transferrin 15 . Induced non - clathrin - mediated tubular membrane invaginations have also been reported for the uptake of Cholera and Shiga toxins , and the simian SV40 virus 16 , 17 , 19 . Formation of these tubules seems to require an intact microtubule network 15 , 16 . Moreover , we have demonstrated the involvement of Rac1 , calmodulin ( CaM ) , and phosphatidy - linositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) in this process 15 . While expression of the constitutively active Rac1 mutant Rac1 G12V completely abolishes membrane tubules , the dominant negative mutant Rac1 T17N triggers the formation . The same phenotype is generated by phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate - 5 - kinase ( PIP5K ) overexpression or by treatment with the CaM inhibitor N - ( 4 - aminobutyl ) - 5 - chloro - 2 - naphthalenesulfonamide ( W13 ) , which increase PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels at the PM 15 . Involvement of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the initiation of endocytic events is determined by its 1 Departament de Biomedicina , Unitat de Biologia Cel·lular , Centre de Recerca Biomèdica CELLEX , Institut d’Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer ( IDIBAPS ) , Facultat de Medicina , Universitat de Barcelona , Casanova 143 , 08036 , Barcelona , Spain . 2 Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats ( ICREA ) , 08010 , Barcelona , Spain .

Afterwards , the decrease of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by specific phosphatases and / or phospholipases , such as synaptojanin or phospholipase C ( PLC ) , is important to promote pinch - off of the plasma membrane and the consequent endocytic vesicle production 26 – 28 . The small GTPases , Rac1 , RhoA , and Cdc42 , are implicated in the regulation of several CIE pathways . Rac1 and RhoA control interleukin - 2 receptor ( IL - 2R ) uptake 29 , 30 , and Rac1 regulates macropinocytosis with Cdc42 , which is also required during clathrin - independent carrier ( CLIC ) and GPI - enriched endocytic com - partment ( GEEC ) endocytosis 31 – 34 . Several CIE pathways also require Pak1 , Pak2 , or cortactin activity , which are Rac1 actin - related targets 30 , 35 , suggesting that Rac1 - dependent actin polymerization plays a key role during these events . The PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding protein dynamin , as well as cortactin , have been reported to be important actin - modulating and membrane - remodeling factors during both CDE and CIE 35 – 37 . Therefore , cortactin and dynamin may be acting downstream of Rac1 to regulate the endocytic tubules formation . Moreover , recent stud - ies have identified myosins regulating endocytosis 38 – 41 , and it has been shown that an increased assembly of actomyosin networks at the PM antagonizes membrane invagination and endocytosis 42 , 43 . Actomyosin is mainly regulated by RhoA through its effector ROCK1 ( rho associated coiled - coil containing protein kinase 1 ) , but also by Rac1 , and these two GTPases usually have opposite effects in several cellular processes 44 . The possible con - tribution of Rac1 - dependent actomyosin regulation to CIE has not been investigated in depth , and nor has its contribution to tubule regulation . Actually , Rac1 could control tubule outcomes by regulating PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels ( via PLC activity ) and cytoskeleton dynamics ( through actin polymerization and myosin activation ) 45 – 51 . In the present study we demonstrate that increased PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels trigger dynamin - dependent endocytic tubules formation and enhance β 1 - integrin internalization , and that this process can be neutralized by Rac1 activation . We show that Rac1 regulates PM endocytic tubule formation by controlling PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels , actin dynamics and myosin activation through activation of PLC , cortactin and ROCK1 , respectively . Importantly , the results reveal ROCK1 as a new Rac1 effector and here we propose a novel Rac1 - dependent ROCK1 activation pathway to regulate membrane dynamics . Results and Discussion Integrin internalization via a clathrin - independent , Rac1 - regulated endocytic pathway . We have previously shown that Rac1 activity can regulate the formation of membrane tubular structures , with the dominant negative Rac1 increasing and the constitutively active mutant reducing the percentage of cells present - ing tubules 15 . These tubular membrane structures , which are also induced after treatment with the calmodulin inhibitor W13 , transported clathrin independent endocytic cargoes like MHCI 15 . Since Rac1 activity can control integrin trafficking , and vice versa 52 – 56 , we have examined whether integrins were also present in these endocytic tubules and if the presence of such tubules affects integrin transport to early endosomes ( EEs ) . COS1 cells were incubated with an antibody that recognizes the β 1 - integrin ectodomain and treated then with W13 for 10 min - utes at 37 °C , before fixing and immunostainning cells with anti - EEA1 antibody . The images in Fig . 1a show the presence of β 1 - integrin ( red ) in W13 - induced tubules , visualized with the expressed membrane marker GFP - mem ( green ) . Whereas β 1 - integrin was clearly detected in EEA1 - positive endosomes of control cells ( Fig . 1b ) , those cells that contained extensive tubulation ( W13 treated ) showed low β 1 - integrin labeling in EEs ( Fig . 1c ) . Considering the presence in tubules as internalized molecules , cells exhibiting tubules showed increase in the total internalized β 1 - integrin after treatment with W13 at different time points ( 5 , 10 and 20 min ) compared with control cells ( Fig . 1d ) . In these settings , the effect of W13 - induced tubules on transferrin internalization , a well - established cargo of the CDE route , was also analyzed ( Fig . 1e ) . Transferrin was not observed in W13 - tubules and increased transferrin internalization was observed only at 20 minutes in W13 - induced tubules com - pared to control cells , which could be explained by the previously reported effect of W13 inhibiting sorting from early endosomes 57 – 60 and consequently transferrin recycling that at later time points contributes to the uptake measurements . Likewise , this could be the reason for increased β 1 - integrin internalization at later time points in W13 - treated cells not presenting tubules . To corroborate that clathrin did not participate in W13 - induced tubule formation , clathrin expression was inhibited by siRNA knockdown ( Fig . 1f ) . Figure 1f shows that clathrin down - regulation did not modify the extend of W13 - induced tubules and , in agreement with the inhibition of recycling , W13 treatment accumulated transferrin in EEs vesicles at the cell periphery in contrast to its perinuclear locali - zation observed in control cells . These results indicate that induced tubular endocytic membrane structures are a cellular port of entry important for β 1 - integrin internalization in a CIE pathway . The effect of W13 on β 1 - integrin internalization was simultaneously analyzed in cells expressing the consti - tutively active Rac1 mutant ( GFP - Rac1 G12V ) . Image quantification showed that Rac1 G12V expression completely abrogated the W13 - increased β 1 - integrin internalization at all - time points analyzed ( Fig . 1d ) , indicating that active Rac1 blocks tubule formation instead of promoting tubule fission . Besides , the results imply that Rac1 is a β 1 - integrin internalization regulator , and suggest that it may regulate integrin turnover through CIE . Induction of dynamin - dependent tubules in CIE pathway by increased PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Next , clathrin - independent endocytic tubules were further characterized and we focused on the molecular mechanisms activated by Rac1 and its regulation . We and others reported that membrane tubules are induced after increasing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels by overexpression of PIP5K 15 , 61 . In fact , W13 - induced PM tubules appear to depend on PIP5K activity 15 . The presence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in W13 - tubules was confirmed by immunostaining with an anti - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 antibody ( Fig . 2a ) . Moreover , tubule induction by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 increase was supported by a dose response curve with exogenous diC8 - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( previously conjugated with the neomycin carrier for its transmembrane delivery ) 62 , 63 ( Fig . 2b ) . Addition of 50 µ M of diC8 - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 increased the percentage of cells with tubules up to approximately 35 % compared to 12 % observed by the neomycin carrier in control cells ( Fig . 2c , d ) . Similar ratio elicited by W13 treatment was observed by overexpression of PIP5K or diC8 - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 incubation ( Fig . 2e ) .

W13 - induced PM tubules provide an internalization pathway for β 1 - integrin . ( a ) COS1 cells grown on coverslips expressing the membrane marker GFP - mem were incubated with an anti - β 1 - integrin rat antibody for 30 minutes at 4 °C to avoid endocytosis , followed by incubation for 10 minutes at 37 °C to allow internalization in the presence of W13 ( 20 min , 4 . 5 µ g / ml ) . After fixation , β 1 - integrin was detected with an Alexa - 555 labeled anti - rat antibody , and images were acquired with a confocal microscope ( Leica TCS SP5 ) .

These results demonstrated a direct relationship between increased PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels and tubule development . Therefore , W13 - treatment could be used to increase PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels and tubulation at the PM . It is known that increased PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 are necessary for endocytosis to proceed because they recruit several PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding proteins , including adaptor proteins , BAR - domain containing proteins , and dynamin ( among others ) 20 . Although dynamin has an important role in the scission of endocytic vesicles from the PM , it has also been involved in membrane deformation and tubular membrane organization 24 , 64 – 68 . Therefore , we investigated the role of dynamin in these PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced tubules . Dynamin action was inhibited by dominant negative mutant expression ( dyn K44A ; Fig . 3a ) , treatment with a specific inhibitor ( dynasore ; Fig . 3a ) , or by siRNA knock - down ( Figs 3b and 2f ) . In each of these experimental settings , W13 - induced tubules were prevented , indicating that this tubular endocytic pathway is dynamin - dependent . Dynamin was necessary to initiate tubule formation , but an additional role of dynamin in the fission of tubules cannot be discarded . Dynamin participates in membrane invagination in combination with BAR - domain containing proteins 43 , 67 . In W13 - induced tubules we have also observed the presence of PACSIN2 , an F - BAR - domain protein that binds dynamin , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and Rac1 69 , 70 . Interestingly , although PACSIN2 interacts with dynamin , it does not bind or colocalize with clathrin 71 . Moreover , in agreement with the report by Kreuk et al . 69 , we showed that expression of the active Rac1 mutant inhibited the presence of PACSIN2 - positive tubules in COS1 cells after W13 treat - ment ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . In addition , it has been reported that PACSIN2 regulates caveolae biogenesis and endocytosis in cholesterol rich and plasma membrane ordered domains 69 , 72 , 73 , where active Rac1 is located 52 , 74 . Actually , we have previously shown that cyclodext rin , a PM cholesterol chelator , inhibited W13 - tubule forma - tion 15 . Therefore , we analyzed whether the specific PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 increase elicited by W13 treatment was respon - sible for tubulation in these domains . Tubules were inhibited in cells expressing a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - phosphatase specifically targeted to PM ordered domains by the 10 N - terminal amino acids of Lck ( L10 - GFP - Inp54p ) 75 . Otherwise , no effect was observed with the phosphatase dead mutant ( L10 - GFP - Inp54p D281A ) ( Fig . 3c ) . Together , these results show that increased PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels in specific PM domains , where clathrin - independent and dynamin - dependent endocytosis takes place , are probably responsible for tubule formation . In agreement with the localization of Rac1 in ordered domains 74 , 76 , tubular endocytic membranes present in control cells , or elicited by W13 treatment , were inhibited by active Rac1 , as well as tubules induced by PIP5K overexpression or by the addition of exogenous diC8 - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 3d ) . These results , together with the fact that Rac1 G12V expressing cells showed reduced PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 immunostaining in W13 - treated cells ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) , prompted us to study the role of Rac1 effectors in tubulation . The role of PLC - regulated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels on tubule inhibition by active Rac1 . Rac1 can modu - late PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels at the PM by activating PLC 77 , 78 , which hydrolyzes PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 generating diacylglycerol ( DAG ) and inositol trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) . Then , we analyzed PLC involvement by two strategies : ( i ) inhibition of PLC activ - ity with its inhibitor U73122 , and ii ) expression of GFP fusion proteins for two previously described constitutively active ( GTP - bound ) , but PLC - deficient , Rac1 mutants ( Rac1 G12V - F37A and Rac1 G12V - W56A ) 77 . Quantification of tubule formation in COS1 cells demonstrates that U73122 impaired the tubule inhibition produced by GFP - Rac1 G12V expression ( Fig . 3e ) . Moreover , the expression of both Rac1 G12V - F37A and Rac1 G12V - W56A did not inhibit tubules in untreated cells ( Fig . 3d ) . These results strongly suggest that PLC plays an important role in Rac1 - dependent tubule inhibition . To further analyze PLC activity involvement in the Rac1 - dependent inhibition of tubule formation , we assessed the effect of Rac1 G12V - F37A and Rac1 G12V - W56A expression on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced tubulation , either by W13 - treatment or PIP5K - overexpression . As expected , W13 and PIP5K induced a similar percentage of cells presenting tubules in control and Rac1 G12V - F37A expressing cells ( Fig . 3f ) , confirming the involvement of PLC activity . However , the expression of the Rac1 G12V - W56A mutant was still able to block tubule formation ( Fig . 3f ) . Together , these results suggest that , although PLC plays a key role in tubule inhibition by active Rac1 , addi - tional mechanism contributes to the inhibition , as revealed through the use of the PLC - deficient mutants . Since Rac1 G12V - F37A mutant is not able to translocate cortactin to the plasma membrane or interact with ROCK1 ( two important factors for cortical actomyosin regulation ) 79 , 80 , the Rac1 G12V - W56A mutant was therefore considered a valuable tool for studying the role of cytoskeleton in the PLC - independent tubular - inhibitory effect of active Rac1 . conditions and the corresponding control was determined by the two - way ANOVA , * p < 0 . 05 , * * * p < 0 . 001 .

Active Rac1 is important to control actin polymerization ( F - actin ) at the PM and F - actin depolymerizing agents are known to generate membrane tubules in many cell types 81 , 82 . Thus , active Rac1 , by increasing F - actin at the cell cortex , could inhibit PM invagination and consequently tubule formation . It has been reported that Rac1 G12V - F37A mutant is defective in cortical actin generation 79 , 83 , 84 . Therefore , it is plausible that the different tubule inhibition response observed with both active mutants in this study ( F37A and W56A ) may be related to their different abilities to regulate actin polymerization .

Fluorescence confocal images showed that GFP - Rac1 G12V and GFP - Rac1 G12V - W56A modified the F - actin pattern by severely reducing stress fibers and increasing cortical F - actin . The effect of G12V was stronger than the G12V - W56A mutant . By contrast , GFP - Rac1 G12V - F37A mutant did not affect the actin organiza - tion ( Fig . 4a ) . Figure 4 .

Actin depolymerization decreased the tubule forma - tion inhibition by Rac1 G12V and completely eliminated the inhibitory effect of Rac1 G12V - W56A ( Fig . 4b ) . These results indicate that inhibition of membrane tubulation by Rac1 depends on actin polymerization , and that actin cytoskeleton is not necessary for membrane invagination and elongation to proceed . Actually , consider - ing the critical role of microtubules ( MTs ) for the stabilization of W13 - induced tubules described previously 15 , and further analyzed here using the MT depolymerizing agent nocodazole ( Fig . 4c ) , and the recently described role of dyneins for the stabilization and elongation of PM tubular structures 16 , the general dynein inhibitor erythro - 9 - [ 3 - ( 2 - hydroxynonyl ) ] adenine ( EHNA ) impaired W13 - induced tubulation in COS1 cells ( Fig . 4d ) . In addition , β - tubulin and F - actin staining in W13 - induced tubules cells expressing Venus - Rac1wt , showed some association of these tubules with MTs but not with F - actin ( Fig . 4e ) . Although only occasional coincidence of MTs with tubules was observed , STED and confocal microscopy images revealed highly similar pattern and direction - ality between both networks ( Figs 4e and S4a ) , which is consistent with the dependency of W13 - induced tubules on the integrity of MTs ( Fig . 4c ) . Accordingly , nocodazole also inhibited β 1 - intergrin internalization elicited by W13 treatment in cells presenting tubules ( Supplementary Fig . S4b ) . These results indicate a key role of dyneins and MTs in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced membrane elongation towards the cell center . In summary , actin cytoskeleton is unnecessary for tubule elongation ( operated by MTs and dyneins ) and Rac1 - driven actin polymerization is critical to inhibit basal and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced membrane invagination . However , the results obtained with LatA cannot rule out a role of actin polymerization in PM invagination scission . Rac1 G12V - W56A and Rac1 G12V - F37A have differential effects on cortical F - actin , which may explain the differences in tubule formation inhibition by each mutant . Indeed , it has been described that active Rac1 F37A is not able to translocate cortactin , an actin polymerizing protein , to the PM 79 . To address if Rac1 G12V - W56A translocates cort - actin to the PM to inhibit PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced tubule formation , we analyzed the location of endogenous cortac - tin in Rac1 G12V , Rac1 G12V - F37A and Rac1 G12V - W56A expressing Vero cells by immunofluorescence ( Fig . 5a ) . These images showed that Rac1 G12V and Rac1 G12V - W56A mutants translocate cortactin to the cell periphery ( being again more clear in Rac1 G12V expressing cells ) , and Rac1 G12V - F37A does not . Additionally , the involvement of cortactin in Rac1 G12V - W56A - dependent tubule inhibition was examined by overexpression of a dominant negative mutant ( cort - actin Δ PHSH3 ) 85 . While expression of the wild type cortactin showed no effect , cortactin Δ PHSH3 expression restored W13 - induced tubules in Rac1 G12V - W56A expressing cells ( Fig . 5b ) . The same result was obtained by slencing cort - actin expression through siRNA transfection in cells expressing Rac1 G12V - W56A and treated with W13 ( Fig . 5c ) , demonstrating that Rac1 needs a functional cortactin to prevent PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced tubulation . ROCK1 activity inhibits endocytic tubule formation downstream Rac1 . In vitro yeast two - hybrid experiments demonstrated that active Rac1 interacted with ROCK1 , whereas the active Rac1 F37A mutant was defective in such interaction 80 , though the functionality of this association has not been reported yet . ROCK1 is a Ser / Thr kinase that is activated after RhoA - GTP binding to its Rho - binding domain ( RBD ) due to the release of its autoinhibitory conformation 86 . To analyze the interaction between ROCK1 and the different Rac1 G12V mutants , we performed a pull - down assay incubating lysates from GFP - Rac1 G12V , GFP - Rac1 G12V - F37A , or GFP - Rac1 G12V - W56A expressing cells with GST - ROCK1 725 – 1024 immobilized on Sepharose beads . This ROCK1 fragment contains the RBD and a N - terminal portion of its kinase domain that facilitates a proper conformation for RBD / Rho - GTP binding 87 . Western blot analysis showed that Rac1 G12V and Rac1 G12V - W56A were both pulled down by GST - ROCK1 725 – 1024 , whereas Rac1 G12V - F37A did not ( Fig . 6a ) . Co - immunoprecipitation experiments showing interaction between Rac1 G12V - W56A and endogenous ROCK1 were performed as well , although , these results were not consistently reproduced probably due to weak and transient Rac1 - ROCK1 interaction and have not been included in this report . In addition , expression of Rac1 G12V induced the recruitment and co - localization of ROCK1 at the PM ( Fig . 6b ) . After binding to Rac1 - GTP , ROCK1 may be activated and become functional in PM domains where Rac1 is present . Supporting the hypothesis that ROCK1 is an effector involved in Rac1 - dependent tubule formation inhibi - tion , the specific ROCK1 inhibitor Y27632 impaired the inhibition of Rac1 G12V - W56A ( Fig . 6c ) . To further confirm ROCK1 involvement in tubule inhibition by the active Rac1 mutant , we silenced ROCK1 expression by siRNA in Rac1 G12V - W56A expressing COS1 cells . Downregulation of ROCK1 completely restored the tubules induced by W13 ( Fig . 6d ) . Although ROCK1 could inhibit tubulation by recruiting cortactin to the PM , this possibility was ruled out using Y27632 in Rac1 G12V - and Rac1 G12V - W56A - transfected cells . Cortactin translocation appears to be independent of ROCK1 activity ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) , in agreement with others authors 79 , 84 , 88 , 89 . These results indicate that , in addition to cortactin translocation and actin polymerization at the PM , active Rac1impairs tubu - lation via ROCK1 activity . However , ROCK1 is a well - known RhoA effector 44 , 90 , and to date no functional relationship has been described with other GTPases . In order to exclude RhoA as the upstream activator of ROCK1 responsible for the inhibition of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced tubule formation , the outcome of RhoA activity on W13 - induced tubules was examined in COS1 cells by expressing the constitutively active ( GFP - RhoA G14V ) and inactive ( GFP - RhoA T19N ) RhoA mutants . The expression of GFP - RhoA T19N did not modify the percentage of cells presenting tubules neither in control nor W13 - treated cells ( Fig . 6e ) . In contrast , when we expressed GFP - RhoA G14V ( expected to activate ROCK1 ) , an important and significant increase in tubule - presenting cells was observed after W13 - treatment , instead of inhibition ( Fig . 6e ) . RhoA and Rac1 are mutual antagonists 44 , 91 , and the observed active RhoA - induced tubulation might be a consequence of endogenous Rac1 inhibition . Moreover , while GFP - Rac1 was present in W13 - induced tubules , GFP - RhoA G14V was almost absent ( Fig . 6f ) . Then , RhoA - induced ROCK1 activation takes www . nature . com / scientificreports / 9 SCIEntIFIC REPORts | 7 : 6866 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 017 - 07130 - x place in different sites , precluding inhibition of tubule formation by RhoA activity . Together , these data suggest that Rac1 / ROCK1 , and not RhoA / ROCK1 , plays a key role in the inhibition of the endocytic tubule formation . Rac1 / ROCK1 - dependent actomyosin assembly inhibits tubulation . Although there is no reported or conclusive role for ROCK1 as an effector of active Rac1 , this protein controls actomyosin downstream of active RhoA . It is feasible , therefore , that by controlling myosin activation , Rac1 / ROCK1 interplay could stabilize actin polymerization at the specific sites where tubules should be induced . In turn , this may inhibit tubule formation by mechanical hindrance or by membrane tension increase . It is known that phosphorylation of myosin light chain protein ( MLC ) is critical for the interaction between myosin and F - actin , and hence for actomyosin generation 92 . Accordingly , MLC phosphatase ( MLCP ) dephosphorylates MLC and impairs actomyosin formation 93 . In fact , Figure 5 . Cortactin is involved in Rac1 - dependent tubule inhibition .

Given that ROCK1 activity may promote actomyosin , we hypothesized that actomyosin induced via Rac1 / ROCK1 97 , could be responsible for tubule inhibition . To investigate this hypothesis , myosin IIA localization was analyzed by immunofluorescence in untreated or Y27632 - treated Vero cells expressing GFP - Rac1 G12V , GFP - Rac1 G12V - F37A , or GFP - Rac1 G12V - W56A . Figure 7 shows that while GFP - Rac1 G12V - F37A did not significantly affect myosin IIA localization ( Fig . 7a ) , expression of GFP - Rac1 G12V or GFP - Rac1 G12V - W56A inhibited myosin IIA stress - fiber localization and enhanced its presence at Figure 6 .

Y27632 treatment inhibited the presence of myosin IIA in both stress fibers and cell periphery in all cells regardless whether they expressed the active Rac1 mutants ( Fig . 7 ) , consistent with the restitution of the W13 - induced tubules after Y27632 treatment in GFP - Rac1 G12V - W56A cells ( Fig . 6c ) . The participation of ROCK1 in myosin IIA localization at the leading edge of wound migrating cells has been previously demonstrated 98 and the results presented here further support the involvement of ROCK1 in Rac1 induction of actomyosin . Finally , to clarify the role of myosin activity in tubule inhibition by Rac1 , we pre - incubated cells expressing GFP - Rac1 G12V - W56A with the general myosin inhibitor blebbistatin before W13 - treatment . In this experiment , blebbistatin effectively restored the W13 - induced tubules in cells expressing GFP - Rac1 G12V - W56A ( Fig . 7d ) . In con - clusion , our data establishes ROCK1 , for the first time , as a novel downstream effector of Rac1 involved in the control of membrane dynamics via myosin regulation . Proposed model of the molecular machinery implicated in the dynamics of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced endocytic tubulation . Taken together , these data support the model summarized in Fig . 8 . The regula - tion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels in cholesterol rich PM ordered domains is crucial for membrane invagination , elonga - tion and fission , enabling the correct progression of CIE ( used for β 1 - integrin internalization ) . When PI ( 4 , 5 ) Figure 8 . Molecular machinery implicated in the biogenesis and inhibition of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced endocytic tubulation . An increase of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in PM ordered domains could induce the recruitment of several PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding proteins to generate an incipient membrane deformation ( 1 ) . When Rac1 activity is low ( 2 ) , the invagination can be elongated by dyneins toward the center of the cell along microtubules . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 accumulation , as well as the high degree of membrane curvature , could lead to the recruitment of dynamin or BAR - domain proteins , which in turn , could propagate and stabilize the tubule . By contrast , when Rac1 activity is high , tubulation process could be inhibited by either PLC activation ( reducing PIP 2 levels ) or cytoskeleton regulation ( inducing cortical actomyosin at the PM ) ( 3 ) . Rac1 appears to stimulate cortactin PM translocation and ROCK1 activity , thereby triggering cortical actin polymerization and association with myosin ( i . e . , actomyosin ) . The resulting over - activation of local actomyosin networks could potentially impede tubulation in one of two ways : ( i ) by forming a local barrier to increasing PM tension or by causing a steric hindrance that impedes the recruitment of tubulating proteins ( 4 ) ; or ( ii ) by generating mechanical forces needed to pinch off membrane invaginations more efficiently ( 5 ) . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 13 SCIEntIFIC REPORts | 7 : 6866 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 017 - 07130 - x P 2 levels increase due to CaM inhibition , PIP5K overexpression , exogenous diC8 - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 administration or Rac1 inhibition , a long tubular plasma membrane network is formed ( Fig . 8 , points 1 and 2 ) . This membrane process requires dynamin , dynein and MTs ( point 2 ) . The results presented above demonstrated that activation of Rac1 ( overexpression of Rac1 G12V ) inhibits the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - dependent tubular PM network formation by two main molecular mechanisms : [ i ] reducing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels through PLC activation ; and [ ii ] inducing cortical F - actin mesh ( via cortactin ) and actomyosin ( via ROCK1 ) formation . Rac1 - mediated cortactin recruitment is insufficient for tubule inhibition , and requires actomyosin formation ( myosin activation ) . Rac1 - induced actomyosin forma - tion prevents PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - dependent tubule establishment either by an actively actin - dependent tubule scission process ( Fig . 8 , point 5 ) or by generating a cortical actomyosin network that produces a local mechanical barrier or increases PM tension to impede membrane invagination ( Fig . 8 , point 4 ) . For the first time , we identify ROCK1 as a novel downstream effector of Rac1 acting in a RhoA - independent manner to regulate membrane dynamics during a tubular CIE . Both Rac1 and RhoA GTPases stimulate acto - myosin formation , but at different times and locations within the cell , and it is possible that both proteins share or compete for ROCK1 . These results suggest that Rac1 activation at the leading edge of migrating cells may be important to stabilize β 1 - integrin in the newly generated adhesions , preventing its internalization and turnover , and therefore facilitating cell movement as a result .
