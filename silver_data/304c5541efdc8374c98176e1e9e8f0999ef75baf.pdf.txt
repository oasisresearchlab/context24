Received for publication June 19 , 2006 ; accepted for publication February 5 , 2007 . The extensive data collection and contact tracing that occurred during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) in Hong Kong , China , allowed the authors to examine how the probability of trans - mission varied from the date of symptom onset to the date of hospitalization for household contacts of SARS patients . Using a discrete - time likelihood model , the authors estimated the transmission probability per contact for each day following the onset of symptoms . The results suggested that there may be two peaks in the probability of SARS transmission , the ﬁrst occurring around day 2 after symptom onset and the second occurring approximately 10 days after symptom onset . Index patients who were aged 60 years or older or whose lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated upon admission to the hospital ( indicating higher viral loads ) were more likely to transmit SARS to their contacts . There was little variation in the daily transmission probabilities before versus after the introduction of public health interventions on or around March 26 , 2003 . This study suggests that the probability of transmission of SARS is dependent upon characteristics of the index patients and does not simply reﬂect temporal variability in the viral load of SARS cases . communicable diseases , emerging ; disease outbreaks ; disease transmission ; Markov chains ; models , statistical ; SARS virus ; severe acute respiratory syndrome Abbreviations : CI , credible interval ; DIC , deviance information criterion ; LDH , lactate dehydrogenase ; SARS , severe acute respiratory syndrome . In attempts to limit the spread of an infectious disease , the timing of infectiousness is critical to understanding the effec - tiveness of control measures such as isolation and quaran - tine ( 1 ) . Nevertheless , most investigators who have modeled the impact of proposed interventions against severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) have assumed that the prob - ability of transmission is constant throughout the duration of illness ( 2 – 4 ) . If the probability of transmission of an infec - tious agent such as SARS does not peak until a week or more after the onset of symptoms , then interventions such as the isolation of symptomatic individuals will be more ef - fective than estimated . However , if a signiﬁcant proportion of transmission occurs before or soon after symptom onset , it will be considerably more difﬁcult to identify and isolate infected persons before they transmit the virus ( 1 ) . Quaran - tine of contacts who were exposed but are not yet symptom - atic , as was done during the 2003 outbreak in Hong Kong , China ( 4 – 6 ) , will also be more difﬁcult but may be of great importance in curbing the epidemic . During the Hong Kong SARS epidemic , a large amount of data was collected that included ( nearly ) complete case - ﬁnding ( 1 , 755 cases ) , extensive contact tracing for all cases , and the ability to assume that the entire population was sus - ceptible because of lack of prior immunity .

We focused on transmission occurring from the day of symptom onset to the day of hospitalization of index patients , and not on nosocomial transmission . Using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods , we simultaneously estimated the daily transmission probabilities and the incu - bation period in a Bayesian , discrete - time likelihood model . We considered stratiﬁed models to assess the association of this pattern of infectiousness with calendar time , age , and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) levels of index patients . MATERIALS AND METHODS Data sources Data from an integrated database linked by unique population - wide identiﬁcation numbers ( SARSID ) , derived from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority eSARS system and a master list containing information on reported contacts from the Hong Kong Department of Health , were analyzed . In this paper , we use the term ‘‘subject’’ or ‘‘contact’’ to refer to a person , infected or not , who was exposed to a SARS case patient—referred to as the ‘‘index case’’ or ‘‘index patient . ’’ On the basis of virologic and clinical ob - servations ( 7 ) , we assumed that an index patient could have infected any reported contact whose date of symptom onset was at least 1 day after his or her own , and that no trans - mission occurred before symptom onset . Subjects who later became cases could be index patients for other contacts within the same household . We included subjects whose exposure to an index patient included one or more ‘‘close contacts’’ ( deﬁned as caring for , living with , or directly contacting the body ﬂuids of a SARS patient ) but excluded ‘‘social contacts’’ ( all other less intensive forms of contact ) . We also excluded subjects whose relationship to an index case was described as ‘‘roommate’’—since these situations were primarily in nurs - ing home settings—and subjects whose index case was part of the Amoy Gardens superspreading event ( deﬁned as liv - ing in or near the Amoy Gardens housing estate ) or another putative point - source outbreak ( 8 ) . To limit the data set to household exposures , we used two different methods to eliminate hospital - or clinic - based exposures ( see the ‘‘Sup - plementary Data’’ section , which is posted on the Journal ’s website ( www . aje . oxfordjournals . org ) ) . Statistical analysis Preliminary analysis . In a preliminary analysis , we sorted index cases on the basis of time to hospitalization ( time from the date of symptom onset to the date of hospital admission ) and examined the proportion of contacts in - fected and the average number of secondary cases generated by each index case . Here , contacts who were exposed to more than one index case were enumerated for each of their index cases . Primary analysis . We used a Markov chain Monte Carlo method to simultaneously estimate the incubation period and the daily transmission probability from the day of symp - tom onset ( day 1 ) to the day of hospital admission of the index patient ( ranging from a minimum of day 1 to a max - imum of day 19 ) . This method accounts for the exposure of some contacts to multiple index cases as well as the likeli - hood of each generation interval . The prior probability of transmission on each day of illness , p ( d ) , followed an in - dependent uniform ( 0 , 1 ) distribution . We assumed that the probability of transmission was the same for days 13 – 19 . The incubation period was assumed to be gamma - distributed ; information on 81 patients with a single known exposure was used to inform the prior distribution ( 6 ) . We updated our joint prior distribution using a discrete - time likelihood model similar to that of Rampey et al . ( 9 ) . For each subject i , his or her household was followed for a period of t f days , labeled t ¼ 1 through t ¼ t f , where this window differed in calendar time for different subjects . If i became infected , t f was chosen as the day on which he or she became symptomatic . If not , exposure was tracked from time t ¼ 1 and the window was chosen to cover all days on which i was exposed to a symptomatic household member . The probability that subject i escapes infection at time t ( assuming that i is susceptible at time t ) is given by e i ð t Þ ¼ Y j 2 h i ð 1 (cid:1) p ð T i ; j ð t ÞÞÞ ; ð 1 Þ where h i is the set of index cases to whom subject i is exposed and T i , j ( t ) is the day of illness of index case j at time t . The likelihood contribution of uninfected contact i is sim - ply the probability that subject i escapes infection from all of his or her index cases at time t ¼ 1 through t f : L ð p j T i ; j ð t Þ ; y i ¼ 0 Þ ¼ Y t f t ¼ 1 e i ð t Þ ; ð 2 Þ where p is the vector of transmission probabilities and y i is the infection status ( 1 ¼ case , 0 ¼ noncase ) of the contact . The likelihood contribution of infected contact i is slightly more complicated , since it takes into account the date of symptom onset of contact i and therefore the incubation period . It is assumed that all infected contacts become symptomatic at time t f . Thus , the likelihood contribution of infected contact i is L ð p ; h j T i ; j ð t Þ ; y i ¼ 1 Þ ¼ X t f t ¼ 1 ½ 1 (cid:1) e i ð t Þ(cid:2) g ð t f þ 0 : 5 (cid:1) t Þ Y t (cid:1) 1 u ¼ 1 e i ð u Þ ; ð 3 Þ where g is the probability density function for the incubation period and h is its parameters . Stratiﬁed analyses . In further stratiﬁed analyses , we as - sessed how transmission probabilities varied for subjects whose index case 1 ) reported symptom onset before or after major public health interventions were imposed on March 26 , 2003 ( 10 ) ; 2 ) had a high LDH level upon admission ( deﬁned as being above the predicted value—see ‘‘Supple - mentary Data’’ ) versus a low LDH level ( 11 ) ; and 3 ) was aged 60 years or older versus younger , given the steep prognostic gradient change near this age threshold ( 6 ) . 356 Pitzer et al . Am J Epidemiol 2007 ; 166 : 355 – 363 The contacts’ incubation period was assumed to be the same across strata . Date of onset , LDH level , and age of the index case were found to be signiﬁcant predictors of nosocomial transmission ( 11 ) or household attack rates ( 12 ) and there - fore could confound and / or modify the relation between duration of exposure and probability of SARS transmission . Stratifying on more than one index case characteristic at a time was not possible because of the limited sample size . The stratiﬁed models were compared with one another and with the unstratiﬁed model using deviance information cri - terion ( DIC ) statistics ( 13 ) . To determine whether the day - to - day variation in the transmission probability suggested by our models was sig - niﬁcant , we compared both the unstratiﬁed and stratiﬁed models with simpler models which assumed that the prob - ability of transmission was constant for the duration of ex - posure . In this case , the probability of transmission on each day was forced to be the same within strata and to follow a single uniform ( 0 , 1 ) prior distribution . We used DIC sta - tistics to compare models . Sensitivity analysis . The foregoing approach to estimat - ing the daily transmission probabilities assumes that there is no variability in the infectiousness of index cases or the susceptibility of their contacts on a given day . To determine the sensitivity of the model to this assumption , we generated a hypothetical population consisting of highly infectious and normally infectious index cases whose probability of trans - mitting SARS to their contacts differed ( see ‘‘Supplemen - tary Data’’ ) . First , we assumed that level of infectiousness was unrelated to duration of exposure ( ‘‘unconfounded het - erogeneity’’ ) ; we then assumed that highly infectious index cases were more likely to be isolated early on in their illness ( ‘‘confounded heterogeneity’’ ) . We also explored whether the probability of transmission could be estimated in the stratiﬁed context for highly and normally infectious index cases when there was confounded heterogeneity . The prob - ability of transmission on each day was estimated and com - pared with the ‘‘true’’ population mean . RESULTS Our ﬁnal data set consisted of 120 infected contacts , 1 , 893 uninfected contacts , and 765 index cases ; some con - tacts were exposed to multiple index cases . Index cases had a mean of 2 . 87 contacts ( table 1 ) . The mean number of secondary cases per index case varied with time to hospi - talization , from a low of 0 . 13 to maximum of 0 . 50 . Our primary analysis of the day - to - day variation in the transmission probability suggested that there might be a bi - modal distribution in the infectiousness of index cases . The probability of transmission per contact was less than 0 . 06 on each day of illness but was estimated to be relatively high the day after symptom onset ( 0 . 029 , 95 percent credible in - terval ( CI ) : 0 . 014 , 0 . 044 ) . There was a larger second peak ( 0 . 058 , 95 percent CI : 0 . 002 , 0 . 169 ) that occurred approxi - mately 10 days after symptom onset ( ﬁgure 1 ) . Estimates for later days were less robust because 1 ) there were fewer ob - servations ( i . e . , only 25 percent of all exposures lasted more than 5 days ) and 2 ) these estimates incorporated uncertainty from earlier days . The incubation period was estimated to follow a gamma distribution with a mean of 4 . 82 days ( 95 percent CI : 4 . 23 , 5 . 50 ) and a variance of 15 . 8 days 2 ( 95 percent CI : 11 . 56 , 22 . 32 ) ( ﬁgure 2 ) .

Index cases whose symptoms began on or after March 26 had similar levels of transmission , with a slightly lower probability on days 1 – 5 post - symptom - onset and a higher peak on days 7 – 9 . However , there were fewer index cases who were symptomatic for a week or more prior to isolation , so the estimates for these days were less precise . Stratifying by date of symptom onset did not improve the ﬁt of the model to the observed data , based on the DIC statistics ( table 2 ) . The probability of transmission from index patients whose LDH level was above the expected level was mark - edly higher than that from those whose LDH level was below the predicted level , peaking on days 8 – 9 of illness ( ﬁgure 4 ) . Index patients with low LDH levels were rela - tively unlikely to transmit infection to their contacts . The probability of transmission from low - LDH index patients was slightly increased the day after symptom onset and again during the second week of illness . The pattern of transmission from index patients whose LDH was not mea - sured was similar to that of the unstratiﬁed data set . Strati - fying by index - case LDH led to a considerably better model ﬁt ( table 2 ) . Similarly , index cases aged 60 years or older had a high probability of transmission compared with younger index patients . The probability of transmission from older index patients was approximately three times higher than in youn - ger index patients during the ﬁrst week of illness and remained high throughout the ﬁrst 9 days of illness , decreas - ing slightly thereafter ( ﬁgure 5 ) . The probability of trans - mission from younger index cases was less than 0 . 022 prior to 1 week after symptom onset but appeared to be higher on days 8 and beyond , although there were limited data in this range . Again , stratifying by index patient age led to a better model ﬁt ( table 2 ) . Comparison with simpler models The probability of transmission was estimated to be 0 . 013 ( 95 percent CI : 0 . 011 , 0 . 016 ) per day for the unstratiﬁed model when transmission was assumed to be constant for the duration of exposure ( table 2 ) . A comparison of the DIC statistics suggested that allowing the probability of trans - mission to vary on each day offered a signiﬁcant improve - ment in model ﬁt for the unstratiﬁed model and most stratiﬁed models but did not improve the ﬁt in comparison with stratifying by LDH level alone ( table 2 ) . Sensitivity analysis : effect of heterogeneity in simulated data For simulated data with infectiousness unrelated to dura - tionofexposure ( unconfoundedheterogeneity ) , themodeles - timated the transmission probability relatively well ( ﬁgure 6 , part a ) . When infectiousness was negatively correlated with duration of exposure ( confounded heterogeneity ) , the model performed slightly worse ( ﬁgure 6 , part b ) . However , the model was able to estimate the daily transmission probabil - ities within strata when we stratiﬁed on the infectiousness of the index case ( normally infectious ( ﬁgure 6 , part c ) vs . highly infectious ( ﬁgure 6 , part d ) . DISCUSSION Previous efforts have been made to estimate the time course of infectiousness for SARS by examining the gener - ation of secondary cases in mainland China ( 14 ) and FIGURE 1 .

While the results of the present analysis support previous ﬁndings that an increase in infectiousness occurs approxi - mately 1 week after symptom onset , they suggest that there FIGURE 3 .

Variability in SARS Transmission to Household Contacts 359 Am J Epidemiol 2007 ; 166 : 355 – 363 may also be an early peak in transmission , with a number of contacts being infected soon after symptom onset in the index case ( s ) . A Bayesian transmission model was used to infer ‘‘in - dividual infectivity proﬁles’’ over the course of SARS in - fection in China ( 14 ) . Variability in the infectivity of SARS cases was modeled using a gamma distribution , which was found to provide the best ﬁt to the data compared with models which assumed that the transmission probability was constant or proportional to viral load . The estimated in - fectivity peaked on day 9 following symptom onset ( 14 ) , similar to the timing of the second peak seen in our analysis . However , such a model would not accommodate a bimodal distribution in the transmission probabilities such as the one suggested here . In Singapore , there were relatively few secondary cases resulting from index patients who were isolated prior to 5 days post - symptom - onset and a large increase thereafter ( 2 ) . While the small number of secondary cases per primary case for persons isolated 0 – 4 days post - symptom - onset is con - sistent with what we observed among household contacts from Hong Kong , in our data set , index cases never gener - ated more than 0 . 5 secondary cases , on average ( table 1 ) . Previous studies found similar household member attack rates in the two countries ( 12 , 15 ) . However , the analysis from Singapore included both hospital - and community - based exposures . Time from symptom onset to isolation de - clined markedly over the course of the Singapore epidemic ( 2 ) , so the association between long time - to - isolation and transmission to secondary cases would have been strongly FIGURE 4 .

Am J Epidemiol 2007 ; 166 : 355 – 363 confounded by any other control measures , including those for nonhousehold transmission , that became more effective over time . Primary - case patients who were isolated 5 or more days after symptom onset may have been the major contributors to nosocomial transmission—which accounted for 76 percent of SARS infections in Singapore ( 16 ) —either because such cases tended to occur earlier in the epidemic when hospitals had yet to institute a policy of isolation for SARS patients ( 2 ) or because such patients had a less severe clinical presentation and thus hospital employees adopted fewer precautions upon their admission . The results of our analysis also seem to be inconsistent with the viral shedding data for 14 patients from the Amoy Gardens housing estate ( 7 ) . The slight increase in the trans - mission probability approximately 10 days after symptom onset does not reﬂect the 100 - fold increase in viral load that occurred between days 5 and 10 in patients from that case series ( 7 ) ; nor is the early peak in transmission we ﬁnd reﬂected in the viral load data . While viral load was not reported for nasopharyngeal swabs collected prior to 5 days after symptom onset in the Hong Kong case series , Tang et al . ( 17 ) found that the proportion of samples collected from possible and probable SARS cases in Toronto , Canada , that tested positive by reverse - transcriptase polymerase chain reaction increased steadily , from 35 . 4 percent for spec - imens collected on days 0 – 2 of illness to more than twice that for samples collected 9 – 11 days after symptom onset . Unlike the studies on viral load , the current study took into account both the infectiousness of index cases and the susceptibility of their contacts . Any discrepancy between our ﬁndings and the viral load data may be due solely to this difference . The early peak in transmission may repre - sent infection of highly susceptible contacts , while the sec - ond peak may reﬂect infection of persons who were only susceptible when exposed to a high cumulative viral dose . Alternatively , the early peak may represent infection of pri - mary caregivers , who had a greater degree of exposure to the index case than other household members . Day - to - day dif - ferences in the precautions taken by household members ex - posed to SARS cases could account for the early peak if household members took fewer precautions during the ﬁrst few days of symptoms than they did later on ( 18 ) . Similarly , the presence of highly infectious persons in the population could contribute to this early peak . If a signiﬁcant proportion of contacts were infected during the ﬁrst few days of exposure ( presumably by highly infectious index FIGURE 6 .

Variability in SARS Transmission to Household Contacts 361 Am J Epidemiol 2007 ; 166 : 355 – 363 cases ) , then fewer susceptible contacts would remain in the household on later days , leading to lower estimates of the transmission probability . This would be even more problem - atic if highly infectious persons tended to be hospitalized earlier in their illness , as suggested by our sensitivity analysis . Stratiﬁcation by index case LDH level or age should have reduced bias in our estimates by controlling for potential confounders . Persons with more severe disease ( as indicated by a high LDH level ) were more likely to transmit SARS to their contacts and tended to do so earlier in their illness . The slight increase in transmission from low - LDH index patients around day 10 is consistent with the timing of peak viremia ( 17 ) . Similarly , the higher probability of transmission from elderly index patients may be due to the increased infec - tiousness of these persons or the increased susceptibility of their contacts . Older index patients were twice as likely to have high LDH levels ( unpublished data ) . Furthermore , as - sessment of the age distribution of SARS cases revealed an excess of cases in the elderly ( 6 , 19 ) , suggesting that they were more susceptible to infection . The infected contacts of older index patients were more than twice as likely to also be aged 60 years or older than the infected contacts of younger index patients . It is also possible that the early peak in transmission was due to the presence of co - primary infections within house - holds . If members of the same household were infected simultaneously in the community but had slightly different incubation periods , persons with longer incubation periods might have been misclassiﬁed as having been exposed in the household . This could have led to overestimation of infec - tiousness soon after symptom onset . However , when we excluded all infected contacts with serial intervals of less than 3 days and reanalyzed the data , the results were similar ( data not shown ) , suggesting that this was not a major source of bias . Several other assumptions were made in our analysis . Based on prior ﬁndings that fewer than 0 . 2 percent of asymptomatic contacts of SARS patients were seropositive in this same population ( 20 ) , we assumed no asymptomatic infections . Further , we assumed that all SARS index patients faithfully reported their date of symptom onset and identi - ﬁed all of their contacts . Incomplete contact tracing might have been a problem early in the epidemic , and some SARS patients might have underreported their contacts because they were too sick to answer questions or because they were reluctant to do so after policies such as quarantine were in - stituted . However , the average number of contacts per index case did not appear to vary with time to hospitalization ( table 1 ) , suggesting that such bias would have had a mini - mal effect on the observed pattern of transmission . Finally , the possible tendency of family members to report to the hospital only after more than one family member had be - come ill might have led to a spurious association between time to hospitalization and infectiousness . However , the fact that we see a similar pattern being repeated across strata suggests that this pattern of infectiousness is real and not a result of bias . This analysis demonstrates the importance of effective disease surveillance , complete case - ﬁnding , and extensive contact tracing during an epidemic . Doing so not only al - lows for isolation of cases and quarantine of contacts , but also permits timely analysis of transmission dynamics so that the effectiveness and utility of certain interventions can be evaluated . More complete analyses following the epidemic allow investigators to better understand the factors contributing to transmissibility . The lessons learned from this analysis do not apply only to SARS , which may or may not reemerge from its animal reservoir ; some of these ﬁndings can probably be extrapo - lated to other diseases as well . The early peak in transmis - sion that we observed may not be speciﬁc to SARS but rather may be due to variability in the susceptibility of con - tacts to any infection .
