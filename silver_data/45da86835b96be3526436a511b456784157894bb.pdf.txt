B ( . The Macmillan Press Ltd . , 1987 The clinical course of bone metastases from breast cancer R . E . Coleman & R . D . Rubens ICRF Clinical Oncology Unit , GuY ' s Hospital , Londclon SE 9RT , UK . Summary All patients with carcinoma of the breast seen in this Unit since 1970 were reviewed to study the incidence , prognosis , morbidity and response to treatment of bone metastases . The biological characteristics of the primary tumour were compared in patients relapsing first in bone or liver . Sixty - nine percent of patients dying with breast cancer had bone metastases and bone was the commonest site of first distant relapse . Bone relapse was more common in receptor positive or well differentiated ( grade 1 ) tumours . The median survival was 24 months in those with disease apparently confined to the skeleton compared with 3 monlhs after fiist relapse in liver . Ten percent of patients with breast cancer developed hypercalcaemia . All had metastatic disease and 85 % had widespread skeletal involvement . Fifteen percent of patients with disease confined to the skeleton developed hypercalcaemia . The response in bone to primary endocrine therapy , and chemotherapy , was apparently less than the overall response achieved . A large proportion had apparently static disease reflecting the insensitivity of the UICC assessment criteria . The duration of survival in these patients was similar to responding patients , suggesting a tumour response may occur in the absence of discernable radiological evidence of healing . The majority of patients with advanced breast cancer have evidence of skeletal metastases by the time of death ( Galasko , 1981 ) . Palliation of symptoms , control of the disease and evaluation of specific therapy are important issues in these patients . Bone metastases may remain asymptomatic but pain is common and hypercalcaemia , pathological fractures and leuco - erythroblastic anaemia may occur . Breast cancer has a variable and often long clinical course and patients with bone metastases in particular frequently have a protracted illness . Although premature death is inevitable , remissions are frequent and patients usually require palliative therapy - local radiotherapy and specific systemic treatment - for many months or years . Evaluating response in bone metastases to systemic therapy is often difficult . Objective assessment of response by UICC criteria ( Hayward et al . , 1977 ) requires radiological evidence of healing of lytic disease . This may not be apparent for 4 - 6 months and is not a direct reflection of changes in the tumour load . Clinical trills using UICC criteria have usually reported lower response rates for bone than the overall response rate achieved by treatment reflecting the insensitivity of assessment methods ( Coleman & Rubens , 1985 ) . During the past 15 years several thousand patients with breast cancer have been treated in this Unit and we report here our experience of the problems caused by bone metastases . Information is presented on clinical course , associated morbidity and the impact of systemic therapy in palliation . Tumour characteristics associated with metastatic disease in bone are analysed and a comparison is made with patients with liver metastases who usually have more aggressive disease of shorter duration . Patients and methods A retrospective analysis of all patients with histologically proven carcinoma of the breast attending this Unit since 1970 has been made . Defined sub - sets have been selected to enable analysis of incidence , morbidity , prognosis and response to treatment of bone metastases and review the biological characteristics of the primary tumour as listed below .

Incidence of metastases Five hundred and eighty - seven patients dying during the period 1979 - 1984 were studied to determinerthe incidence of bone metastases and visceral disease . Additionally , 2240 patients presenting to this Unit over the past 10 years with primary breast cancer were analysed to ascertain the distribution and relative frequency of first relapse . Survival , complications and course after first relapse A comparison of survival has been made in 498 patients with first evidence of metastatic disease in the skeleton and 80 with first relapse in liver since 1975 . Analysis of subsequent complications and the distribution of subsequent relapse at other sites was assessed in the 498 patients with first relapse in bone . Tumour characteristics A comparison of steroid receptor status and histological grade ( infiltrating ductal tumours only ) was made between patients with first relapse in bone and those developing liver metastases . Because first relapse in the liver is unusual , and receptor status and histological grading were not always known , all patients developing liver disease , at any time , were selected for these comparisons . Hormonal status Oestrogen receptor ( ER ) status was measured in 150 / 498 patients with first relapse in bone and 75 with relapse in the liver . Progesterone receptor ( PgR ) status was measured in 110 patients with first relapse in bone and 60 with relapse in the liver . Steroid receptor analysis was by the method of King et al . ( 1979 ) . A value > 5 fmol mg - 1 cytosol protein was considered positive . Histological grading of the primary tumour using the method of Bloom and Richardson ( 1957 ) was known in 861 patients with metastatic disease . Ninety - five had grade I ( well - differentiated ) , 464 grade 2 ( intermediate differentiation ) , and 302 grade 3 ( poorly differentiated ) tumours . Response to treatment A comparison of overall response to treatment with that in bone was made in 183 patients receiving primary endocrine therapy , of whom 112 had bone metastases , and 126 patients , all with skeletal involvement , receiving a variety of Br . J . Caticet - ( 1987 ) , 55 , 61 - 66 62 R . E . COLEMAN & R . D . RUBENS chemotherapy regimens . The time to progression and survival of patients with responding , static and progressive disease were compared by Mantel - Cox log - rank analysis . Assessment of response was by UICC criteria ( Hayward et al . , 1977 ) . Hypercalcaemia Hypercalcaemia was identified in 147 patients seen in this Unit since 1975 . The distribution of metastatic disease in these patients , the frequency of skeletal involvement , and prognosis have been assessed . Skeletal disease was considered to be widespread if 5 or more foci of increased tracer uptake were visible on bone scan with radiological confirmation of at least one lesion . Minimal skeletal involvement implied either lack of radiological confirmation or fewer than five lesions identifiable on the bone scan . The incidence of hypercalcaemia was determined in 1049 patients with breast cancer who died in the decade 1975 - 1984 . Management of metastatic bone disease A full blood count , biochemical screen , and chest radiograph had been performed in all patients . Radionuclide bone scans with technetium labelled methylene diphosphonate were performed in all patients whenever progressive disease was suspected . Appropriate radiographs were taken of areas of abnormal tracer uptake . Radionuclide liver scans were performed in patients with hepatomegaly or liver function abnormality . Various systemic treatments have been used during the time period of this study . These have followed a logical sequence based on the knowledge of three variables . These are : ( 1 ) the extent , pattern and aggressiveness of the initial presentation of metastatic disease ; ( 2 ) the menopausal status of the patient ; ( 3 ) the hormone receptor status of the tumour . Hormone treatment has been the preferred initial treatment , chemotherapy being used for patients failing to respond to , or relapsing after , endocrine therapy . Exceptions to this are patients with aggressive visceral disease and those with hormone receptor negative tumours when cytotoxic chemotherapy is the initial treatment of choice ( Figure 1 ) . Additional treatments were used for complications of bone metastases . Hypercalcaemia was initially treated by intra - venous rehydration with normal saline . Patients becoming normocalcaemic or remaining only mildly hypercalcaemic commonly received oral phosphates to maintain control . Those remaining hypercalcaemic were , until recently , treated with mithramycin or calcitonin to inhibit bone resorption , but now our present preferred agent for control of hyper - calcaemia is 3 amino , l , hydroxypropylidene - l , l - bisphosphonate ( APD ) ( Coleman & Rubens , 1986 ) . To treat , or to reduce the risk of pathological fracture of a long bone , internal fixation followed by radiotherapy was performed . This usually relieved pain and provided optimum conditions for callus formation and bony union . Spinal cord compression was treated by surgical decompression if the signs were rapidly progressing , but radiotherapy was preferred for slowly progressing , previously non - irradiated sites of compression . Bone marrow infiltration causing leuco - erythroblastic anaemia often occurred late in the course of the disease and , when it had become resistant to hormones , treatment was by cautious low dose chemotherapy and haematological support . Results Incidence and prognosis of bone metastases Bone was the most common site of metastatic disease . Four hundred and eighty - five of 587 ( 69 % ) patients dying with breast cancer in the 5 year period 1979 - 84 had radiological evidence of skeletal metastases before death . In comparison 158 ( 27 % ) had lung metastases , and 157 ( 27 % ) liver metastases . Bone was also the most common site of first distant relapse . In the past ten years 2240 patients have presented to this Unit with primary breast cancer . Six hundred and eighty - one ( 30 % ) have relapsed after a median follow - up of nearly 5 years . Two - hundred and forty - five relapses ( 36 % ) were classified as local , 395 ( 58 % ) as distant and 41 ( 6 % ) concurrent local and distant . One hundred and eighty - four patients relapsed first in bone ( 47 % of all first distant relapse ) . Table I shows the distribution and relative frequency of first relapse . The mean age of patients with first relapse in either bone or in liver was 57 years ( range 29 - 79 and 29 - 78 years in bone and liver respectively ) .

The median duration of survival in 498 patients with first relapse in bone was 20 months . In 253 patients with metastatic disease apparently confined to the skeleton the median duration of survival was 24 months . The median duration of survival after first relapse in liver was only 3 months . ( Figure 2 ) . 0 > 1 E cc Time ( months ) Figure 2 Survival after first relapse in bone or liver .

Tumour characteristics Table III compares ER and PgR in patients with first relapse in bone and liver metastases ( not necessarily first site of relapse ) . First relapse in bone was more common than the development of liver metastases in ER positive ( P = < 0 . 001 ) and PgR positive tumours ( P = < 0 . 05 ) . Spread to the liver was more likely from ER and / or PgR negative tumours .

Bone metastases were more common with well - differentiated tumours . Fifty - seven of 95 ( 60 % ) of patients with grade 1 and 120 / 302 ( 40 % ) with grade 3 tumours developed bone metastases ( P = < 0 . 05 ) . First relapse in bone was also more common from well differentiated tumours . Liver metastases were more common in poorly differentiated tumours but this difference was not significant . The development of either liver or lung metastases ( visceral disease ) at any time was related to histological grade . Twenty of 95 ( 21 % ) of patients with grade I and 124 / 302 ( 410 % ) with grade 3 tumours developed visceral disease ( P = < 0 . 001 ) .

The rate of progression overall and in bone was similar at 27 % . Apparently static disease in bone was common ( 31 % ) and 24 % of bony sites were unassessable , because of either sclerotic appearance on X - ray , rapid extra - skeletal progression , or lack of follow - up . Sixty - eight patients had both osseus and non - osseus metastases . Fourteen of 68 ( 21 % ) of the former and 27 / 68 ( 40 % ) of the latter showed objective response . The response rate in non - osseus sites was significantly higher ( P = < 0 . 02 ) . Similarly response in bone to chemotherapy appeared less common than the overall response . Thirty - seven of 126 ( 29 % ) patients , all with bone metastases , treated with combination chemotherapy achieved complete or partial response . Response in bone was less frequent with 18 % showing radiological evidence of healing ( Table VI ) . A high proportion of patients ( 47 % ) in this series also appeared to have static bone disease . The survival of patients with bone metastases receiving primary endocrine therapy is shown in Figure 3 . Responding patients have the best prognosis with a median duration of survival which exceeds 30 months compared with 7 months in non - responders ( P = < 0 . 001 ) . There is no significant difference in survival between responding patients and those with static disease although the trend is in favour of those showing objective response . This suggests that a tumour response may occur in the absence of discernable radiological evidence of healing . Mor - bidity c aused by bone metastases Hypercalcaemia is a common complication of advanced breast cancer . One hundred and one of 1049 ( 10 % ) patients dying with breast cancer in the period 1975 - 84 developed hypercalcaemia .

Twenty - two of 147 ( 15 % ) had minimal or no evidence of skeletal involvement identified by either radionuclide bone scan or X - ray . Liver metastases were identified before or at the time of hypercalcaemia in 68 / 147 patients ( 46 % ) . Liver involvement was more common in patients with little or no skeletal involvement ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Table VII ) . Eighty - six of 498 ( 17 % ) of patients with first relapse in bone developed hyper - calcaemia . In those with metastatic disease confined to the skeleton 15 % subsequently became hypercalcaemic , compared with 31 % of 94 patients who had additional spread to the liver ( P < 0 . 001 ) . Patients with hypercalcaemia have a poor prognosis despite active treatment . The median survival after hypercalcaemia is 3 months ( range 0 - 56 months ) and was similar in patients with or without liver metastases . Pathological fracture of a long bone occurred in 78 / 498 ( 16 % ) patients after first relapse in bone . The median duration of survival after fracture was 12 months ( range 0 - 66 months ) . Thirteen of 498 developed spinal cord compression with a median survival of 3 months ( range 0 - 26 months ) after this complication . Discussion Bone metastases are common in advanced breast cancer and the 69 % incidence of radiologically confirmed skeletal metastases here is in accordance with the 47 - 85 % incidence reported in autopsy series ( Gelasko , 1981 ) . Lung or liver metastases were each identified before death in 27 % of women dying with breast cancer . This however is less than the 57 - 77 % and 50 - 71 % incidence of disease in lung and liver respectively reported in autopsy series ( Di Pietro ct a / . , 1976 ) indicating relatively frequent asymptomatic disease aIt these sites as well as reflecting the insensitivity of clinical and imaging techniques for detecting disease in these organs . Bone is also the commonest site of first distant relapse of breast cancer ( McNeil , 1984 ) . In this study bone was the first site of distant relapse in 47 % and viscera ( liver , lung , pleura ) in 25 % . Despite the relative frequency of bone relapse this occurred in only 8 % of 2240 patients presenting to this Unit with primary breast cancer . This low incidence in an unselected population helps explain why routine bone scanning in the follow - up of early breast cancer is not cost effective ( Lee , 1985 ) . Age and disease free interval were similar in patients with first relapse in either bone or in liver . Relapse in liver was not more common in pre - menopausal patients despite the tendency for lower receptor values in this group ( Croton et al . , 1981 ) . Metastatic bone disease , unlike liver disease , frequently followed a protracted clinical course . The median duration of survival was 24 months in patients with disease apparently confined to the skeleton . This study confirms that bone metastases are more common in well differentiated receptor positive tumours , while liver metastases are more frequent with receptor negative anaplastic tumours ( Elston et al . , 1980 ) . Clinical trials in the treatment of breast cancer using the UICC criteria of response have usually reported lower reponse rates for bone lesions than the overall response ( Stewart et al . , 1982 ) . Possibly this could be a true phenomenon if bone metastases are biologically different and relatively refractory to treatment , but it seems more likely that the difference is apparent rather than real because of the insensitivity of assessment methods . Indeed the association between bone metastases and receptor positive , well differentiated tumours would predict a high response rate . This underestimation of response to both primary endocrine therapy and chemotherapy was also seen in this study . The incidence of progressive disease was similar , but the proportion of patients with non - assessable or apparently stable disease was higher in bone . Survival from the start of endocrine treatment was similar in patients with either objective response or stable disease . We are currently evaluating alternative response criteria including radionuclide bone scanning , biochemical parameters of bone metabolism and subjective assessment . Preliminary results show that prediction of objective response within 3 - 4 weeks of starting treatment is possible ( Coleman et al . , unpublished data ) . Morbidity from bone metastases was common . Twenty - nine percent of patients with first relapse in bone subsequently developed one or more of the major compli - cations of bone destruction , hypercalcaemia , pathological fracture and spinal cord compression . The prognosis of patients with hypercalcaemia was poor with a median dura - tion of survival of 3 months but prolonged remissions up to 56 months are seen . Better prediction of impending pathological fracture and early orthopaedic intervention might reduce the frequency of this unpleasant complication . This review of a single Unit ' s large experience of patients with bone metastases treated by a logical sequence of treatments has presented data on various clinical and pathological aspects of metastatic bone disease . It has confirmed the clinical importance of bone metastases , the long and usually symptomatic clinical coursc , the . 1 ( 66 R . E . COLEMAN & R . D .
