Here , we report that cortactin is localized with the actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 com - plex at sites of actin polymerization within the lamelli - podia . Two distinct sequence motifs of cortactin con - tribute to its interaction with the cortical actin network : the fourth of six tandem repeats and the amino - termi - nal acidic region ( NTA ) . Cortactin variants lacking ei - ther the fourth tandem repeat or the NTA failed to lo - calize at the cell periphery . Tandem repeat four was necessary for cortactin to stably bind F - actin in vitro . The NTA region interacts directly with the Arp2 / 3 com - plex based on afﬁnity chromatography , immunoprecipi - tation assays , and binding assays using puriﬁed compo - nents . Cortactin variants containing the NTA region were inefﬁcient at promoting Arp2 / 3 actin nucleation activity . These data provide strong evidence that cortac - tin is speciﬁcally localized to sites of dynamic corti - cal actin assembly via simultaneous interaction with F - actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex . Cortactin interacts via its Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain with ZO - 1 and the SHANK family of postsynaptic density 95 / dlg / ZO - 1 ho - mology ( PDZ ) domain – containing proteins , suggesting that cortactin contributes to the spatial organization of sites of actin polymerization coupled to selected cell surface transmembrane receptor complexes . Key words : actin • cortactin • lamellipodia • Arp2 / 3 complex Introduction Dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton plays a cen - tral role in a variety of cellular events , including adhesion , division , spreading , and motility ( Mitchison and Cramer , 1996 ) . Engagement or activation of cell surface growth fac - tors and adhesion receptors influences the assembly and arrangement of F - actin networks ( Zigmond , 1996 ; Schoen - waelder and Burridge , 1999 ) . Transmission of extracellular signals to the actin cytoskeleton is governed by small GTP - ases of the Rho family , as well as by the activity of numer - ous actin - binding proteins ( Ayscough , 1998 ; Hall , 1998 ) . The Rho family GTPases , Cdc42 and Rac , play a critical role in the formation and organization of cortical actin networks in mammalian cells . Treatment of cells with agents that increase GTP - bound Cdc42 stimulates filopo - dia formation ( Kozma et al . , 1995 ) , whereas activation of Rac leads to membrane ruffle and lamellipodia formation ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ) . Formation of cortical actin networks , resulting either from EGF stimulation ( Chan et al . , 1998 ) or activated Rac ( Machesky and Hall , 1997 ) , requires de novo formation of F - actin filaments , indicating that Cdc42 and Rac integrate signal pathways leading to actin poly - merization . In addition , Rac activation is closely coupled to activation of Cdc42 ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) , allowing for the coincident and coordinated formation of filopodia and lamellipodia that are often concurrently observed at the leading edge in motile cells ( Rinnerthaler et al . , 1988 ) . Actin polymerization at the leading edge provides the pro - trusive force required for the extension of lamellipodia ob - served during cell motility and spreading ( Small et al . , 1999 ) . Cortical actin polymerization initiated by Cdc42 and Rac requires the participation of members of the Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome protein ( WASp ) 1 superfamily ( Bi and Address correspondence to J .

Binding of activated Cdc42 to N - WASp induces filopodia ( Miki et al . , 1998a ) , whereas Rac - induced membrane ruffling utilizes the structurally related protein Scar1 ( also known as WASp family verpolin - homologus protein [ WAVE ] ) ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ; Miki et al . , 1998b ) . All WASp / Scar family proteins contain a car - boxyl - terminal motif rich in acidic residues , which is re - sponsible for their activity ( Higgs and Pollard , 1999 ) and mediates binding to the actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 complex ( Machesky and Gould , 1999 ) . Arp2 / 3 complexes consist of the actin - related proteins Arp2 and Arp3 along with five other proteins designated p41 - , p34 - , p21 - , p20 - , and p16 - Arc ( Machesky and Gould , 1999 ) ( also desig - nated as ARPC1 – 5 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the sides of preexisting actin filaments and stimulates new filament formation to create branched actin networks , a process termed the “dendritic nucleation” model of cortical actin assembly ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ) . As predicted by this model , the Arp2 / 3 complex is located at branch points of actin filament networks in lamellipodia , as seen by electron microscopy ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) , and is localized to sites of dynamic actin as - sembly and motility in living cells ( Schafer et al . , 1998 ) . Arp2 / 3 - induced actin nucleation and polymerization are greatly enhanced by the binding of WASp family acidic carboxyl - terminal domains to p21 - Arc ( Machesky and In - sall , 1998 ) , thus providing a molecular link for Cdc42 and Rac leading to cortical actin polymerization ( Machesky et al . , 1999 ; Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) . In addition to the Arp2 / 3 complex , several actin binding proteins are selectively recruited into cortical actin struc - tures upon activation of Cdc42 or Rac ( Kobayashi et al . , 1998 ; Mishima and Nishida , 1999 ; Kessels et al . , 2000 ) , in - cluding the Src kinase substrate cortactin ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) , an actin binding protein enriched within lamellipodia ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) . The localization of cortactin within membrane ruffles and lamellipodia is controlled by activa - tion of Rac ( Weed et al . , 1998 ) . Cortactin possess a multi - domain structure consisting of an acidic domain at the amino terminus , followed by 6 and 1 / 2 tandemly repeated 37 – amino acid segments , an a helical region , a proline - rich segment , and a Src homology ( SH ) 3 domain located at the carboxyl terminus ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) . The direct binding to F - actin is mediated through sequences within the tandem repeat region ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) . The SH3 domain interacts with several postsynaptic density ( PSD ) 95 / dlg / ZO - 1 ( PDZ ) domain – containing proteins , including cort - actin - binding protein 1 ( CortBP1 ) ( Du et al . , 1998 ) , SHANK3 ( Naisbitt et al . , 1999 ) , ZO - 1 ( Katsube et al . , 1998 ) , and an unrelated protein cortactin - binding protein ( CBP - 90 ) ( Ohoka and Takai , 1998 ) . Tyrosine phosphory - lation of cortactin occurs in response to a wide variety of cellular events , including v - Src transformation ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) , growth factor treatment ( Maa et al . , 1992 ; Zhan et al . , 1993 ) , bacterial invasion ( Dehio et al . , 1995 ; Fawaz et al . , 1997 ) , osmotic stress ( Kapus et al . , 1999 ) , and integrin or syndecan - 3 ligation with the extracellular matrix ( Vuori and Ruoslahti , 1995 ; Kinnunen et al . , 1998 ) . These previous studies suggest that cortactin plays an important role in coupling tyrosine kinase – based signaling events to cortical cytoskeletal reorganization . We have in - vestigated the molecular mechanism by which cortactin in - teracts with the dynamic actin cytoskeleton . In this report we provide evidence that the Rac - induced localization of cortactin to the cell periphery requires two separate re - gions within the amino terminus : the amino - terminal acidic domain ( NTA ) and the fourth tandem repeat . We find that the fourth repeat is necessary for the F - actin binding activity of cortactin and that the NTA region binds directly to the Arp2 / 3 complex . Cortactin colocalizes with Arp2 / 3 complex at sites of dynamic actin assembly in lamellipodia . We propose that one of the roles of cortactin is to link PDZ - containing scaffolding proteins to sites of Arp2 / 3 - mediated cortical actin assembly . Materials and Methods DNA Constructs Cortactin expression constructs were created by PCR amplification of mp85 . L7 ( Miglarese et al . , 1994 ) . For production of cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) - driven cortactin constructs containing the FLAG epitope , the fol - lowing cDNA fragments were produced by PCR : N - term ( codons 1 – 330 ) , NTA ( codons 1 – 84 ) , repeats ( codons 85 – 330 ) , and C - term ( codons 350 – 546 ) . All 5 9 primers contained a KpnI restriction endonuclease site and all 3 9 primers contained a stop codon followed by an EcoRI site . Amplified products were subcloned into KpnI - EcoRI – digested pcDNA3FLAG2AB ( Devarajan et al . , 1997 ) . In some cases , PCR fragments were first cloned into PCR - Script ( Stratagene ) before subcloning . For construction of full - length cortactin lacking the fourth repeat , a KpnI - BamHI PCR fragment spanning the amino terminus to the end of the third repeat ( codons 1 – 195 ) was ligated in frame with a BamHI - EcoRI fragment encoding the start of the fifth repeat through the carboxyl terminus ( codons 232 – 546 ) and KpnI - EcoRI – digested pcDNA3FLAG2AB . The full - length FLAG - tagged cortactin construct has been described previously ( Du et al . , 1998 ) . CMV - driven myc - tagged cortactin expression constructs were pro - duced by PCR as BamHI - EcoRI fragments and subcloned into BamHI - EcoRI – digested pRK5myc ( Olson et al . , 1996 ) . Constructs produced were : full - length ( codons 1 – 546 ) , N - term ( codons 1 – 330 ) , N - repeat 5 ( codons 1 – 269 ) , N - repeat 4 ( codons 1 – 232 ) , N - repeat 3 ( codons 1 – 195 ) , N - repeat 2 ( codons 1 – 158 ) , N - repeat 1 ( codons 1 – 121 ) , repeat 3 - C - term ( codons 158 – 546 ) , repeat 4 - C - term ( codons 195 – 546 ) , repeat 5 - C - term ( codons 232 – 546 ) , repeat 6 - C - term ( codons 269 – 546 ) , and C - term ( codons 350 – 546 ) . FLAG - RacL61 was constructed by digestion of pRK5myc - RacL61 ( Lamarche et al . , 1996 ) with BamHI and EcoRI , and the resultant Rac cDNA fragment was subcloned into BamHI - EcoRI – digested pcDNA3FLAG2AB . Expression and immunoreactivity of each cortactin variant were verified by Western blotting of whole cell lysates with either the antiepitope tag mAbs M5 ( against FLAG ) or 9E10 ( against myc ) and anticortactin antibodies ( data not shown ) . For production of the glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - cortactin prokaryotic expression constructs , GST - N - term , GST - NTA , and GST - repeats , BamHI - EcoRI PCR fragments were produced encoding the appropriate codons and subcloned into BamHI - EcoRI – digested pGST - parallel 2 ( a gift from P . Sheffield , University of Virginia ) , as described previously ( Sheffield et al . , 1999 ) . For the GST - N - repeat 5 construct , pRK5myc - N - repeat 5 was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and the cort - actin fragment was subcloned into pGST - parallel 2 . The GST construct containing the verpolin homology , cofilin , and acidic ( VCA ) domains of N - WASp has been described previously ( Egile et al . , 1999 ) . All PCR - gen - erated constructs were verified by DNA sequencing . Antibodies and Western Blotting The anticortactin antibodies anti - N - term , anti - C - term , and 4F11 , have been described previously ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ; Weed et al . , 1998 ) . The specificity of the anti - N - term and C - term cortactin antibodies was verified by Western blotting of transfected cell lysates ( see Fig . 1 B ) . The 9E10 mAb against the cmyc epitope was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech - nology , Inc . Anti - FLAG mAb M5 was purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . Affinity - purified rabbit pAbs against p21 - Arc ( Welch et al . , 1997a ) and Arp3 ( a gift from M . Welch , University of California at Berkley , Berkeley , CA ) ( Welch et al . , 1997b ) were used for immunofluorescence detection of the Arp2 / 3 complex ; rabbit antisera against Arp3 , Arp2 , and p34 - Arc were used for Western blotting ( a gift from L . Machesky , University of Birmingham , Birmingham , England ) ( Machesky et al . , 1997 ) .

Cortactin Localization and Binding to F - Actin and Arp2 / 3 31 Probes , Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , and CHEMICON Inter - national , Inc . Secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech . Western blotting was performed as described previously ( Kanner et al . , 1990 ) . Primary antibodies were used at the following concentrations or di - lutions : 9E10 ( 3 m g / ml ) , M5 ( 5 m g / ml ) , 4F11 ( 1 m g / ml ) , anti - N - term or anti - C - term ( 1 m g / ml ) , Arp3 ( 1 : 500 ) , and p34 - Arc ( 1 : 500 ) . Primary anti - bodies were detected with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase – conju - gated secondary antibody ( 1 : 2 , 000 ) and immunoreactive bands were visu - alized using enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchonic acid assay kit ( BCA ; Pierce Chemical Co . ) . Cell Culture , Microinjection , and Transfection Swiss 3T3 , C3H 10T1 / 2 ( a gift from S . Parsons , University of Virginia ) , and PtK1 cells expressing a green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - Arp3 fusion were cultured as described previously ( Schafer et al . , 1998 ; Weed et al . , 1998 ) . Subconfluent , serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells were prepared as de - scribed ( Lamarche et al . , 1996 ) . Microinjection of myc - tagged cortactin constructs and membrane ruffling initiated by PDGF and PMA were per - formed as described ( Weed et al . , 1998 ) . At least 50 microinjected cells ex - pressed each construct as determined by immunofluorescence micros - copy . For transfection experiments , C3H 10T1 / 2 cells were grown to 80 % confluence in 100 - mm dishes and transfected with 10 m g of each epitope - tagged cortactin construct using SuperFect™ ( QIAGEN ) . Cotransfection experiments with epitope - tagged RacL61 and cortactin constructs were conducted at a 4 : 1 ( wt / wt ) Rac / cortactin ratio . For immunofluoresence studies , cells were cultured 18 h after transfection , detached with trypsin / EDTA , neutralized with soybean trypsin inhibitor ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , plated onto fibronectin - coated coverslips , and allowed to spread for 1 h , after which cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence mi - croscopy . A minimum of 75 cotransfected cells was evaluated for each cortactin construct . Immunofluoresence Microscopy Swiss 3T3 and C3H 10T1 / 2 cells were fixed and immunolabeled as de - scribed ( Weed et al . , 1998 ) . Epitope - tagged constructs were detected with either M5 ( 5 m g / ml ) or 9E10 ( 3 m g / ml ) . Endogenous cortactin was labeled with either anti - N - term or anti - C - term ( 2 m g / ml ) . PtK1 cells were immu - nolabeled as described ( Schafer et al . , 1998 ) . Cells were double labeled with the anticortactin mAb 4F11 ( 0 . 9 m g / ml ) and anti - Arp3 ( 4 m g / ml ) or p21 - Arc ( 6 m g / ml ) . GFP - Arp3 – expressing cells were labeled with 4F11 . Actin Cosedimentation Assays F - actin binding assays were adapted from Fanning et al . ( 1998 ) . Confluent 100 - mm dishes of transfected C3H 10T1 / 2 cells were rinsed twice with PBS and collected on ice by scraping into 0 . 5 ml of binding buffer ( 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 2 , 75 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 0 . 5 mM DTT ) supple - mented with 1 mM EGTA , 1 m g / ml leupeptin , and 1 m g / ml aprotinin . Cells were lysed with a Dounce homogenizer ( 50 strokes ) , and the lysate was centrifuged at 100 , 000 g for 1 h at 4 8 C . Rabbit muscle G - actin ( Cytoskele - ton ) was diluted to 2 . 5 mg / ml in binding buffer and polymerized for 1 h at room temperature . F - actin ( 5 . 5 m M ) was incubated with 60 – 80 m l of cell lysate ( z 50 m g of protein ) in a final volume of 200 m l for 30 min at room temperature . Samples were centrifuged at 100 , 000 g for 1 h at 20 8 C in a 42 . 2 Ti rotor ( Beckman Instruments ) , the supernatant was removed , and the pellet was incubated for 1 h at 4 8 C with 50 m l of G buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , and 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 ) ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) . Supernatant and pellet fractions were normalized , and equal amounts were solublized in 2 3 SDS - PAGE sample buffer . Frac - tions were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting with 4F11 , M5 , or 9E10 mAbs . Binding was quantitated by densitometric scans of the x - ray films shown in Figs . 3 and 4 for each immunoreactive band or an equivalent area from films exposed in a linear range using the program ImageQuant ® ( v . 1 . 2 ; Molecular Dynamics ) . Percent bound was calculated as : P / S 1 P 3 100 , where S and P are the amounts of cortactin immunore - activity in the supernatant ( S ) and pellet ( P ) fraction . Protein Preparation and Purification GST - cortactin constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli strain DH5 a , and fusion proteins were purified from isopropyl - 1 - thio - b - D - galac - topyranoside – induced bacteria , as described ( Sheffield et al . , 1999 ) . Fu - sion proteins were captured by incubation with glutathione – Sepharose 4B ( 5 ml / 2 liters of culture ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) and eluted with 10 mM reduced glutathione in suspension buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 3 M NaCl , and 0 . 5 mM EDTA ) . TEV™ protease ( 300 U ; GIBCO BRL ) was added to the eluate , and the solution was dialyzed overnight at 4 8 C against 4 liters of suspension buffer containing 1 mM DTT . In cases of incomplete digestion , an additional 200 U of TEV™ was added , and the solution was incubated at 16°C overnight . Cleaved GST was removed by the addition of glutathione - Sepharose . TEV™ protease was removed by the addition of 200 m l of Ni - NTA™ agarose ( 50 % slurry ; QIAGEN ) . Arp2 / 3 complex was purified from bovine brain as described ( Egile et al . , 1999 ) . Protein purity was monitored by Coomassie blue staining after SDS - PAGE , with all products estimated to be at least 90 – 95 % pure . Affinity Chromatography and Capillary Mass Spectrometry Recombinant cortactin fragments ( 10 mg ) were coupled to cyanogen bro - mide – activated Sepharose 4B ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Resins were suspended in 1 ml of col - umn buffer ( 20 mM Hepes - KOH , pH 7 . 8 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM EDTA , and 1 % NP40 ) and stored at 4°C . Coupling efficiency was z 90 % . For affinity purification of amino - terminal cortactin binding proteins , extracts were initially prepared from murine brain . Whole brain tissue from 11 5 – 6 - wk - old NIH 3T3 mice was Dounce homogenized in 8 ml of column buffer containing 10 mg / ml leupeptin and 1 mM PMSF . The lysate was centrifuged at 1 , 900 g for 10 min , and the supernatant was stored at 2 80 8 C . Cortactin N - term – Sepharose beads ( 100 m l of a 50 % slurry con - taining z 1 mg of coupled protein ) were incubated with 16 mg of brain ly - sate ( 4 mg / ml ) for 30 min at 4 8 C . Beads were then washed with 4 ml of col - umn buffer followed by 3 ml of column buffer containing 150 mM KCl . Bound proteins were eluted with 60 m l of SDS - PAGE sample buffer , sep - arated by SDS - PAGE , and visualized by Coomassie blue staining or by Western blotting . Coomassie - stained bands representing proteins specifi - cally associated with cortactin N - term were excised , trypsin digested , sub - jected to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ( LC - MS ) analysis ( Mandal et al . , 1999 ) , and analyzed by searching the NCBI database using a computer - based algorithm ( Yates , 1998 ) . Additional experiments were performed using C3H 10T1 / 2 fibroblast lysate with an N - repeat 5 resin , since this protein was purified at much higher yields than cortactin N - term . Cells were lysed in column buffer containing inhibitors and centrifuged at 5 , 000 g for 5 min , and 3 mg of ly - sates ( 6 mg / ml ) were incubated with 80 m l of GST , N - repeat 5 , NTA , or repeats - Sepharose for 2 h at 4 8 C . After incubation , beads were washed twice with lysis buffer , and bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with anti - Arp3 antibodies . Immunoprecipitation C3H 10T1 / 2 cells transfected with FLAG - tagged cortactin constructs were lysed in lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibi - tors ( 10 m g / ml leupeptin , 1 . 0 U / ml aprotinin , 0 . 5 mM PMSF , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 1 mM sodium vanadate , and 40 mM sodium fluoride ) and centri - fuged at 5 , 000 g for 5 min . Clarified lysates ( 700 m g ) were incubated with 20 m l of FLAG M2 affinity resin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 2 h at 4 8 C . Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation , washed twice with 1 . 0 ml of lysis buffer , separated by SDS - PAGE , and Western blotted with anti - Arp2 , - Arp3 , and - M5 antibodies . Binding Assays Arp2 / 3 complex ( 700 ng ) was incubated with Sepharose conjugated to GST , cortactin NTA , cortactin N - repeat 5 or cortactin repeats 1 – 5 in 200 m l of binding buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 1 % NP40 ) for 30 min at 4 8 C . The Sepharose was collected by centrifugation , washed twice with binding buffer without ATP , and bound Arp2 / 3 was visualized by Western blotting with anti - Arp3 after SDS - PAGE . For affinity measurements , 2 . 1 nM Arp2 / 3 was incubated with 0 . 46 , 1 . 2 , 2 . 3 , and 4 . 7 m M cortactin N - repeat 5 , as described above . The amount of Arp2 / 3 bound to cortactin was quantitated by densitometry and ImageQuant ® as described above . Actin Polymerization Assays Actin polymerization assays were conducted essentially as described ( Cooper et al . , 1983 ) . In brief , recombinant cortactin proteins ( 0 . 2 – 2 . 0 m M ) or the GST - VCA fragment of human N - WASp ( a gift from Marie - France Carlier , Dynamique du Cytosquelette , Laboratoire d’Enzymologie on F eb r ua r y 21 , 2013 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published October 2 , 2000 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 151 , 2000 32 et Biochemie Structurales , Gif - sur - Yvette , France ) were incubated with 10 nM Arp2 / 3 complex in 20 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM EGTA at 25 8 C . Actin polymerization was initiated by the addition of monomeric actin ( 7 . 5 % pyrene labeled ) and monitored by continuous measurement of the emission at 386 nm in a SPEX FluoroMax fluorometer ( JY , Inc . ) . The temperature was maintained at 25 8 C through - out the experiment . Results Growth Factor – induced Translocation of Cortactin into Membrane Ruffles Requires the Amino - terminal Domain In serum - starved cells , growth factor – mediated activation of Rac1 leads to the translocation of cortactin from cyto - plasmic pools into lamellipodia , where it colocalizes with cortical F - actin ( Weed et al . , 1998 ) . To identify the cortac - tin sequences necessary for lamellipodia localization , epitope - tagged cortactin expression constructs encoding various regions of the protein were introduced into mouse fibroblasts , and the Rac - induced translocation of the vari - ant cortactin proteins to the cell cortex was evaluated ( Fig . 1 A ) . Subconfluent , serum - starved Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were microinjected with either myc - N - term or myc - C - term con - structs , and the intracellular distribution of N - term and C - term cortactin was compared with that of endogenous cortactin ( Fig . 2 ) . In serum - deprived cells , myc - N - term , myc - C - term , and endogenous cortactin were diffusely dis - tributed throughout the cytoplasm ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . Treatment of cells with PDGF or PMA , agents that acti - vate Rac ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ) , resulted in the accumulation of myc - N - term and endogenous cortactin within mem - brane ruffles at the cell cortex ( Fig . 2 A ) . Myc - C - term cortactin failed to translocate efficiently to the cell periph - ery ( Fig . 2 B ) . Therefore , the amino - terminal half of the cortactin molecule is necessary to target cortactin to the cell periphery . Rac - induced Translocation of Cortactin to the Cell Cortex Requires Both the Amino - terminal Acidic and Tandem Repeat Region To determine which region ( s ) within the amino - terminal domain are required for Rac - induced cortactin transloca - tion , FLAG - tagged cortactin expression constructs were cotransfected with constitutively active myc - RacL61 into 10T1 / 2 fibroblasts .

FLAG - full - length cortactin and FLAG - N - term showed peripheral localization , whereas FLAG - C - term did not localize to the cortex , although endogenous cortac - tin did localize correctly ( Fig . 3 B ) . To further delineate the regions within the amino - termi - nal domain responsible for cortical targeting , FLAG - tagged constructs that encoded the NTA and the repeats domain ( encompassing the six and one half tandem repeat sequences ) were tested ( Fig . 1 A ) . Both FLAG - NTA and FLAG - repeats failed to accumulate at the cell cortex when coexpressed with myc - RacL61 , in spite of the near complete translocation of endogenous cortactin in cells ex - pressing these constructs ( Fig . 3 B ) . These data indicate that both the NTA and the repeat region are necessary for translocation of cortactin to the cell cortex , and that nei - ther region alone is sufficient for translocation . Since the actin binding activity of cortactin is contained within the tandem repeat region ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) , cells ex - pressing various FLAG - tagged cortactin constructs were lysed and the actin binding activity of the tagged cortac - tin constructs was evaluated ( Fig . 3 C ) . FLAG - full - length and FLAG - N - term cosedimented with F - actin , whereas FLAG - C - term did not ( Fig . 3 C ) . FLAG - repeats , which lacks the NTA region , bound actin at levels comparable to FLAG - N - term ( Fig . 3 C ) . These data suggest that F - actin binding alone is insufficient for the peripheral localization of cortactin . The Fourth Cortactin Repeat Is Required for Cortical Localization and F - Actin Binding The sequences of the six 37 – amino acid tandem repeats in the cortactin amino terminus are highly similar to each other ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) . To determine whether one or more of the tandem repeats was involved in cortical tar - geting , a series of myc - tagged cortactin expression con - structs was produced that retained the NTA , but in which the individual tandem repeats were truncated from the carboxyl terminus of the myc - N - term construct ( Fig . 1 A ) . Myc - N - term , Myc - N - repeat 5 , and N - repeat 4 accumu - lated at the cell edge , but translocation of N - repeat 3 , N - repeat 2 , or N - repeat 1 ( not shown ) was significantly re - duced ( Fig . 4 A ) . These results suggest that the fourth re - peat is required for cortical targeting . To directly test this , a full - length cortactin construct was produced lacking the fourth repeat ( FLAG - full - length D 4 ) and assayed for corti - cal localization , where it also failed to accumulate at the Figure 2 . The cortactin amino - terminal domain is required for targeting to growth factor – induced membrane ruffles . Subconflu - ent , serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells were microinjected with either myc - N - term ( A ) or myc - C - term ( B ) . 2 – 3 h after microinjection , cells were left untreated ( Starved ) or treated with 5 ng / ml PDGF or 100 nM PMA as indicated . After stimulation , cells were fixed and coimmunostained for endogenous cortactin with anti - C - term ( A ) or anti - N - term ( B ) pAb and for expression of myc - tagged cortactin constructs with 9E10 ( A and B ) .

Endogenous cortactin translo - cated normally in all experiments . Taken together with the data presented above , we conclude that sequence ele - ments within the fourth tandem repeat of cortactin are necessary for localization to the cell cortex . Cortactin binds directly to F - actin with a K d of 0 . 4 m M ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) , suggesting that targeting of cort - actin to the leading edge may involve direct binding to cor - tical actin filaments . To define the portion of the repeat re - gion responsible for actin binding , myc - N - term constructs containing serial deletions of individual repeats were as - sayed for F - actin binding in cell lysates ( Fig . 4 , B and C ) . Myc - N - term and myc - N - repeat 5 bound actin at compara - ble levels , whereas myc - N - repeat 4 bound actin at dimin - ished levels ( Fig . 4 B ) . Myc - N - repeat 3 , myc - N - repeat 2 , and myc - N - repeat 1 all failed to bind F - actin ( Fig . 4 B ) . These data map the actin binding region of cortactin be - tween the fourth complete and seventh partial tandem re - peats . To further define which sequences within this re - gion were required for actin binding , myc - tagged cortactin constructs were produced where the NTA and the individ - ual tandem repeats were serially deleted from full - length cortactin beginning with the third repeat ( Fig . 1 B ) . Myc - repeat 3 - C - term displayed strong binding to F - actin , whereas myc - repeat 4 - C - term weakly associated with F - actin ( Fig . 4 C ) . Myc - repeat 5 - C - term , myc - repeat 6 - C - term , and myc - C - term all failed to significantly bind F - actin ( Fig . 4 C ) . These data indicate that repeat four is central to the actin binding activity of cortactin , with effi - cient binding requiring a single adjacent repeat , either repeat three ( Fig . 4 B ) or repeat five ( Fig . 4 C ) . The re - quirement for repeat four in actin binding was directly ex - amined using FLAG - full - length D 4 , where removal of re - peat four eliminated the binding of cortactin to F - actin ( Fig . 4 D ) . These data , combined with the requirement for repeat four in cortical targeting , suggest that the ability of cortactin to localize with cortical actin networks in vivo re - quires the actin binding site located within the fourth tan - dem repeat . The Cortactin Amino - terminal Domain Associates with the Arp2 / 3 Complex Although the actin binding domain in repeat four is essen - tial for cortical localization , the inability of the repeats re - gion alone to target the cell cortex ( Fig . 3 B ) indicated that actin binding alone is insufficient for localization at the cell periphery . The NTA alone also failed to target to the cortex , but the NTA plus the repeats ( i . e . , N - term ) did tar - get appropriately . Therefore , we searched for other pro - teins that might interact with the amino - terminal domain and contribute to cortactin translocation . The cortactin Figure 4 .

Cortactin Localization and Binding to F - Actin and Arp2 / 3 35 amino - terminal domain was expressed in E . coli as a GST fusion protein , and the purified protein was covalently coupled to agarose beads . After application of a mouse brain extract , the affinity matrix was washed extensively and bound proteins were subjected to SDS - PAGE ( Fig . 5 A ) . Based on a comparison with control lanes , 13 bands that appeared to represent proteins specifically associated with the cortactin amino - terminal domain were selected for LC - MS analysis . Sequence analysis and a search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information database revealed that four bands contained peptide sequences cor - responding to five members of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 5 A ) . The presence of Arp2 / 3 complex proteins associated with N - term , but not control beads , was confirmed by Western blotting with antisera specific for Arp3 and p34Arc ( Fig . 5 B ) . These data indicate that the Arp2 / 3 complex represents a subset of the proteins that interact with the amino terminus of cortactin . Cortactin Binds the Arp2 / 3 Complex through Sequences in the NTA Region To identify the region within the cortactin amino terminus responsible for associating with the Arp2 / 3 complex , Sepharose beads covalently coupled to the NTA and re - peats regions were incubated with 10T1 / 2 fibroblast lysate , and Arp2 / 3 binding was assayed by immunoblotting ( Fig . 6 A ) . Arp3 specifically bound to N - repeat 5 ( see Materials and Methods ) and NTA beads , but not to GST and re - peats beads ( Fig . 6 A ) , indicating that the NTA region is responsible for association with the Arp2 / 3 complex . To confirm the interaction between cortactin and the Arp2 / 3 complex in vivo , 10T1 / 2 fibroblasts were trans - fected with FLAG - cortactin expression constructs , and overexpressed cortactin fusion proteins were immuno - precipitated with anti - FLAG . Coimmunoprecipitation of Arp2 / 3 complex proteins was assessed by immunoblotting . Both Arp3 ( Fig . 6 B , top ) and Arp2 ( data not shown ) coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG - full - length , FLAG - N - term , and FLAG - NTA . Precipitation of FLAG - repeats and FLAG - C - term fusion proteins failed to coprecipitate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 6 B ) . Precipitation of each FLAG - cortactin peptide was verified by immunoblotting with the anti - FLAG mAb M5 ( Fig . 6 B , bottom ) . These data support the conclusion that cortactin interacts with the Arp2 / 3 complex through sequences within the 84 – amino acid NTA domain . Cortactin Binds to Purified Arp2 / 3 Complex : Functional Analysis of the Interactions To determine whether the association of cortactin with Arp2 / 3 was direct , affinity chromatography assays were performed with various Sepharose - conjugated amino - ter - minal cortactin proteins and purified Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 7 A ) .

Fur - thermore , addition of increasing amounts of cortactin N - repeat 5 - Sepharose to a fixed amount of Arp2 / 3 com - plex displayed saturable binding , with an estimated K d of 1 . 3 m M ( Fig . 7 B ) . These data strongly indicate that cortac - tin directly interacts with the Arp2 / 3 complex . Since cortactin binds directly to Arp2 / 3 complex , we hy - pothesized that cortactin might stimulate the actin nucle - ation activity of Arp2 / 3 . Stimulation of Arp2 / 3 complex was measured in a pyrene actin polymerization assay ( Fig . 7 C ) . Nucleation of new actin filaments by Arp2 / 3 complex causes a rapid rise in pyrene actin fluorescence due to the increased number of free barbed ends available for poly - merization ( Higgs et al . , 1999 ) . In the presence of 10 nM Arp2 / 3 complex and 2 . 5 m M actin , cortactin N - repeat 5 ( curve b ) , repeat 1 – 5 ( curve c ) , full - length ( curve d ) , and NTA ( curve f ) ( all at 0 . 5 m M ) failed to stimulate Arp2 / 3 complex to nucleate new actin filaments ( Fig . 7 C ) . Con - centrations of cortactin proteins up to 1 m M did not acti - vate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( n 5 3 , data not shown ) . Addi - tion of the N - WASp VCA domain ( curve a ) strongly promoted actin nucleation , indicating that the Arp2 / 3 complex was functional . Also , cortactin proteins , at con - centrations up to 2 m M , did not inhibit the ability of the VCA fragment at threshold ( 0 . 5 nM ) concentrations to ac - tivate Arp2 / 3 complex . When the concentration of the Arp2 / 3 complex was increased 10 - fold to 100 nM , cortactin at 0 . 5 m M showed weak activation of nucleation . The na - ture of the weak cortactin - dependent nucleation activity is currently under study . Cortactin Localizes with the Arp2 / 3 Complex in Fibroblast Lamellipodia To determine if cortactin and the Arp2 / 3 complex were present within the same subcellular compartments , cortac - tin and Arp2 / 3 complex localization in fibroblast lamelli - podia was determined by indirect immunofluoresence . Double staining of PtK1 cells with antibodies specific for Arp3 or p21 - Arc ( Welch et al . , 1997a ) and the anticortac - tin mAb 4F11 ( Fig . 8 ) yielded very similar staining pat - terns , with both components being present at the leading edge and in peripheral spots ( Schafer et al . , 1998 ) . Merged images demonstrated a large degree of overlap in both subcellular regions . Colocalization of cortactin with Arp3 was also demonstrated in a PtK1 cell line stably expressing GFP - Arp3 ( Schafer et al . , 1998 ) . GFP - Arp3 and cortactin Figure 8 .

Cortactin Localization and Binding to F - Actin and Arp2 / 3 37 were both present at the leading edge and within periph - eral spots , with significant overlap in merged images ( Fig . 8 ) . Based on these data , we conclude that cortactin is a component of the Arp2 / 3 - regulated cortical actin struc - tures present in lamellipodia . Discussion Cortactin is involved in several protein tyrosine kinase – based signaling pathways , where its phosphorylation is co - incident with reorganization of cortical actin cytoskele - tal networks . The localization of cortactin with cortical F - actin within lamellipodia requires Rac activity ( Weed et al . , 1998 ) . The sequences responsible for the selective tar - geting of cortactin to the cell periphery are unknown . In this report we provide evidence that Rac - induced localiza - tion of cortactin to the cell cortex requires two distinct sequence motifs within the amino - terminal half of the protein . One targeting motif encompasses the fourth 37 – amino acid tandem repeat . Removal of repeat four abolishes the ability of cortactin to localize at the cell pe - riphery in cells cotransfected with RacL61 and greatly di - minishes binding of cortactin to F - actin in vitro . The sec - ond localization motif resides within the 84 – amino acid NTA region and is also required for Rac - induced cortical localization . The NTA region binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex as determined by affinity chromatography and immuno - precipitation from cell lysates and by direct binding assays with purified cortactin and the Arp2 / 3 complex . Immuno - fluoresence localization experiments support a functional interaction between cortactin and the Arp2 / 3 complex in that the Arp2 / 3 complex and cortactin colocalize at the leading edge and within punctate spots within lamellipo - dia , both regions of active actin dynamics . Therefore , we conclude that the Rac - induced interaction of cortactin with cortical sites of actin assembly requires the bipartite interaction of cortactin with actin filaments and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 9 A ) . Cortactin interacts with components of the cortical actin network in several cell types . In addition to the lamellipo - dia of cultured cells ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ; Weed et al . , 1998 ) , cortactin is also found at sites of cortical F - actin re - organization in many differentiated cells , including growth cones and the PSD of neurons ( Du et al . , 1998 ; Naisbitt et al . , 1999 ) , the terminal web of polarized epithelia ( Wu and Montone , 1998 ) , and neuromuscular junctions ( Peng et al . , 1997 ) . The biochemical mechanism discussed here , in which cortactin interacts with both F - actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex , may also be the basis for the interaction of cort - actin with dynamic actin in these other specialized cellular compartments . Regulation of the actin cytoskeleton plays an essential role in the organization of transmembrane receptor com - plexes within highly specialized cell structures ( Bloch and Morrow , 1989 ; Adam and Matus , 1996 ; Jou et al . , 1998 ) . The data presented in this report , in conjunction with the characterization of several cortactin SH3 domain binding proteins , leads us to propose that cortactin functions to link a variety of cell surface receptors to sites of Arp2 / 3 - directed actin polymerization ( Fig . 9 A ) . In neurons , the SH3 domain of cortactin interacts with members of the CortBP1 / SHANK family of scaffolding proteins ( Du et al . , 1998 ; Naisbitt et al . , 1999 ) . CortBP1 / SHANK proteins possess a single PDZ domain and are capable of interact - ing directly with the type 2 somatostatin receptor ( Zitzer et al . , 1999 ) or indirectly through the scaffolding proteins guanylate kinase – associated protein ( GKAP ) , PSD95 , or Homer to the N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) , inositiol tri - sphosphate , or metabotropic glutamate receptors ( Boeck - ers et al . , 1999 ; Naisbitt et al . , 1999 ; Tu et al . , 1999 ) . Addi - tionally , the SH3 domain of cortactin binds ZO - 1 , a component of tight junctions ( Katsube et al . , 1998 ) . Tight junctions occur in the terminal web of polarized epithelia ( Fath et al . , 1993 ) , a region where ZO - 1 and cortactin are colocalized ( Stevenson et al . , 1986 ; Wu and Montone , 1998 ) . ZO - 1 is structurally similar to PSD - 95 ( Itoh et al . , 1993 ) and has been implicated in regulating tight junction assembly ( Sheth et al . , 1997 ) . ZO - 1 binds to cytoplasmic motifs in occludin ( Furuse et al . , 1994 ) and claudin ( Itoh et Figure 9 . Cortactin links transmembrane receptor complexes to sites of dynamic actin assembly .

Binding of cortactin to F - actin through sequences in the fourth tandem repeat tethers cortactin to polymerized actin .

( B ) Comparison of cortactin NTA with in - teraction motifs in Arp2 / 3 binding proteins . The acidic interac - tion domain of reported Arp2 / 3 - activating proteins contain either a DDW or DEW sequence ( boxed , except Scar1 ) within or near their demonstrated Arp2 / 3 binding regions . The NTA region of cortactin also contains this motif , which may confer the ability to bind to and / or activate Arp2 / 3 complex . Aligned sequences shown are from Miglarese et al . ( 1994 ) ( cortactin ) , Wiedmann et al . ( 1997 ) ( ActA ) , Dujon et al . ( 1994 ) ( Myo3p ) , Derry et al . ( 1995 ) ( WASp ) , Fukuoka et al . ( 1997 ) ( N - WASp ) , and Bear et al .

Therefore , the coupling of ZO - 1 to Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin dynamics by cortactin may in part contribute to the organization and assembly of transmem - brane networks within tight junctions as well as at the PSD ( Fig . 9 A ) . Activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex has been suggested to be critical for protrusive - based actin locomotion ( Borisy and Svitkina , 2000 ) . Colocalization of cortactin with the Arp2 / 3 complex at the leading edge and in protrusive dis - tal lamellar regions ( Schafer et al . , 1998 ) , the direct bind - ing of cortactin to Arp2 / 3 in vitro , and the tyrosine phos - phorylation of cortactin in response to growth factor receptor activation ( Maa et al . , 1992 ; Zhan et al . , 1993 ) suggest a role for cortactin in linking sites of actin poly - merization to cell surface receptor complexes . The ob - servation that cortactin does not efficiently stimulate Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin nucleation ( although low levels of nucleation are observed at higher concentrations of Arp2 / 3 ) is consistent with cortactin not being a direct activator of actin polymerization . However , it is possible that addi - tional factors / proteins may cooperate to increase the ef - fect of cortactin on Arp2 / 3 activation . Thus , possible functions of cortactin may be to bridge sites of dynamic actin reorganization with receptor signal - ing complexes and / or to recruit , via SH3 interactions , other proteins that may positively or negatively regulate Arp2 / 3 actin polymerization . In addition to WASp / Scar family proteins , binding of ActA from Listeria monocytogenes ( Welch et al . , 1998 ) or yeast Myo3p and 5p ( Evangelista et al . , 2000 ; Lechler et al . , 2000 ) stimulates actin reorganization mediated en - tirely , or in part , by the Arp2 / 3 complex . Whereas car - boxyl - terminal acidic regions from WASp and Scar bind to p21 - Arc ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ) , Myo3p and 5p bind Arc40p ( equivalent to mammalian p41 - Arc ) through the carboxyl - terminal tryptophan residue ( Evangelista et al . , 2000 ) . The cortactin NTA region contains a sequence mo - tif ( DDW ) that is identical to the last three amino acids in Myo3 and Myo5p , and homologous sequences are present in the carboxyl terminus of nearly all WASp / Scar family proteins ( Fig . 9 B ) . The ActA amino terminus contains a similar motif near sequence elements required for the maintenance of Listeria actin tail formation ( Lasa et al . , 1997 ) . This sequence in cortactin is conserved across spe - cies and is also present in the cortactin - related protein HS1 ( Fig . 9 C ) . We are currently testing if this motif is re - quired for the binding of cortactin to the Arp2 / 3 complex . The data presented here indicate that the fourth tandem repeat is necessary for the F - actin binding activity of cort - actin and for targeting cortactin to cortical actin structures . The sequence of repeat four is not homologous to other actin binding domains . Isoforms of cortactin are generated by alternative splicing , with cortactin A ( Ohoka and Ta - kai , 1998 ) corresponding to the full - length cortactin form used in these studies . Alternative splicing removes repeat six ( cortactin B ) or repeats 5 and 6 ( cortactin C ) ; all of these isoforms bind F - actin . These results , coupled with the reported inability of the first three cortactin repeats to bind F - actin ( He et al . , 1998 ) , support the conclusion that the F - actin binding domain is contained within repeat four . Cortactin variants containing the sixth repeat are re - ported to cross - link F - actin ( Huang et al . , 1997 ; Ohoka and Takai , 1998 ) , an activity that can be downregulated by Src - mediated phosphorylation of cortactin ( Huang et al . , 1997 ) . Furthermore , based on the analysis of the cortactin - related protein HS1 ( Kitamura et al . , 1989 ) and HS1 – cort - actin hybrid proteins , the fourth cortactin tandem repeat has been suggested to interact with phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) , which also downregulates F - actin cross - linking by cortactin ( He et al . , 1998 ) . In spite of these data , the mechanism by which cortactin cross - links actin filaments is currently unknown . The association of cortactin with the Arp2 / 3 complex and F - actin is likely to impact multiple signaling pathways in a variety of cell types . In addition to linking scaffolding proteins in neuronal and epithelial systems , cortactin may also link the machinery for actin polymerization , Arp2 / 3 complexes , to signals emanating from the leading edge of motile cells . Ectopic overexpression of cortactin stimulates cell motility that is dependent on Src phosphorylation ( Huang et al . , 1998 ; Patel et al . , 1998 ) , suggesting that cort - actin contributes to cell migration mediated by Src kinase activity ( LaVallee et al . , 1998 ; Liu et al . , 1999 ) . Cortactin is overexpressed in many cell lines derived from human tu - mors containing amplification of chromosome 11q13 that posses high metastatic potential ( Schuuring et al . , 1992 ; Patel et al . , 1996 ) and is present within invadopodia in in - vasive breast cancer cell lines ( Bowden et al . , 1999 ) . Inva - dopodia serve as sites of extracellular matrix degradation by sequestering or secreting various serine and metallo - proteinases ( Chen and Wang , 1999 ) , and such structures directly correlate with invasive potential . How cortactin overexpression leads to increased motility and metastatic potential is currently unclear . The proper spatial and temporal localization of cortac - tin with newly forming cortical actin networks is likely to be important for cortactin function . Recently , it was shown that the activity of Rac and the EGF receptor syn - ergize to enhance signaling to the Raf - Mek - Erk pathway leading to cell motility ( Leng et al . , 1999 ) . Therefore , Rac - induced localization of cortactin at sites of Arp2 / 3 activity may enhance the efficiency of signal transmission at the leading edge by linking growth factor – mediated receptor signals to downstream effector pathways ( Klemke , et al . , 1997 ) . Activated Arp2 / 3 complex forms a polarized gradi - ent during neutrophil chemotaxis , becoming concentrated at the migratory front ( Weiner et al . , 1999 ) , and is coinci - dent with sites of activation of chemoattractant receptor signaling complexes ( Servant et al . , 2000 ) . Organization of receptor signaling complexes at the leading edge may in part be controlled by Arp2 / 3 and / or cortactin . EGF - induced cell motility also requires the integration of multi - ple signaling pathways ( Wells et al . , 1998 ) . Tyrosine phos - phorylation of cortactin initiated by EGF ( Maa et al . , 1992 ) , in conjunction with the distribution of cortactin with dynamic cortical actin structures , positions cortactin as a potential mediator of one or more of these signaling pathways . The possibility that cortactin plays a role in the regulation of cortical actin assembly and / or spatial organi - zation of cell surface receptors suggests that cortactin may provide an important site of signal integration between protein tyrosine kinases and the actin cytoskeleton . on F eb r ua r y 21 , 2013 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published October 2 , 2000 Weed et al .
