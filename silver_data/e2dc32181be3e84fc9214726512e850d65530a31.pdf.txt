Classical theories of phase separation are limited to thermal 12 equilibrium , and traditional methods can only simulate a limited number of condensates . In this 13 paper , we introduce a novel mean - field - like method that allows us to simulate millions of conden - 14 sates in a heterogeneous elastic medium to model the dynamics of transcriptional condensates in 15 chromatin . Using this method , we unveil an elastic ripening process in which the average con - 16 densate radius exhibits a unique temporal scaling , ⟨ R ⟩ ∼ t 1 / 5 , different from the classical Ostwald 17 ripening , and we theoretically derive the exponent based on energy conservation and scale invari - 18 ance . We also introduce active dissolution to model the degradation of transcriptional condensates 19 upon RNA accumulation . Surprisingly , three different kinetics of condensate growth emerge , corre - 20 sponding to constitutively expressed , transcriptional - bursting , and silenced genes . Notably , multiple 21 distributions of transcriptional - bursting kinetics from simulations , e . g . , the burst frequency , agree 22 with transcriptome - wide experimental data . Furthermore , the timing of growth initiation can be 23 synchronized among bursting condensates , with power - law scaling between the synchronization pe - 24 riod and dissolution rate . Our results shed light on the complex interplay between biomolecular 25 condensates and the elastic medium , with important implications for gene expression regulation . 26 I . INTRODUCTION 27 Biomolecular condensates are membraneless cellular 28 compartments with many crucial physiological functions , 29 e . g . , stress adaptation , accelerating biochemical reac - 30 tions , reducing noise [ 1 – 6 ] . Specifically , transcription - 31 related condensates comprised of RNA polymerases 32 ( RNAPs ) are observed in both prokaryotes and eukary - 33 otes [ 7 – 12 ] , suggesting an essential role of RNAP con - 34 densates in gene expression regulation . Biomolecular 35 condensates are often liquid droplets forming via liquid - 36 liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) [ 2 , 13 ] , supported by their 37 fluid - like behaviors [ 1 , 14 – 16 ] . Classical LLPS theories fo - 38 cus on liquid droplets in a liquid environment at or evolv - 39 ing towards thermal equilibrium [ 13 , 17 , 18 ] . According 40 to classical LLPS theories , molecules flow from small to 41 big condensates to reduce the total surface energy , called 42 Ostwald ripening . The outcome is a single large conden - 43 sate because this configuration minimizes the surface en - 44 ergy . However , in many cases , the surrounding environ - 45 ments of biomolecular condensates are not simple viscous 46 liquids , e . g . , the nucleoplasm is filled with chromatin , and 47 the cytoplasm contains cytoskeleton . It has been found 48 that the elastic medium can interact with condensates 49 and affect their growth and coarsening [ 19 – 26 ] . For ex - 50 ample , light - activated condensates in vivo were observed 51 to be constrained by the chromatin as the condensates 52 could only stay in the chromatin - sparse region [ 23 ] . Soft 53 matter experiments also found that the droplet - forming 54 molecules flow from droplets in stiff medium to droplets 55 in soft medium , suggesting a new driving force of coarsen - 56 ing due to elasticity beyond the classical LLPS theories 57 [ 27 , 28 ] . It is still unclear whether the elastic driving 58 force generates any novel universality class of the ripen - 59 ing process beyond the Ostwald ripening . 60 Furthermore , numerous out - of - equilibrium processes 61 consume energy inside living cells . In particular , the ef - 62 fects of active chemical reactions on the formation and 63 morphologies of condensates have been intensely studied 64 recently [ 29 – 31 ] . One notable function of active chemical 65 reactions is to generate multiple stable coexisting con - 66 densates beyond the classical Ostwald ripening [ 1 , 32 – 67 35 ] . While active chemical reactions consume energies , 68 such as ATP , alternative mechanisms to generate coex - 69 isting condensates have been proposed , e . g . , through the 70 nonlinear elasticity of surrounding network [ 20 , 22 , 25 ] , 71 which do not consume energy . In the meantime , other 72 out - of - equilibrium processes also play crucial roles in con - 73 densate formation and dissolution . For example , recent 74 experiments found that RNAP condensates can dissolve 75 due to the accumulation of transcribed mRNAs , which is 76 also an active process consuming energy [ 36 ] . 77 In this work , we study the out - of - equilibrium dynam - 78 ics of biomolecular condensates in a heterogeneous elastic 79 medium . Regarding the theoretical tools , we introduce 80 a novel mean - field - like model , which allows us to sim - 81 ulate millions of condensates simultaneously and signif - 82 icantly exceeds the computation capacity of traditional 83 2 Elastic Network FIG . 1 . Biomolecular condensates grow in the interspace of a heterogeneous elastic medium . Each condensate has a fixed inside concentration c in and a shared outside concentration c out . Condensates’ growth is suppressed by the surrounding elastic medium through a confining pressure , which can be different among condensates . phase - field simulations [ 13 ] . We first study the case of 84 a neo - Hookean elastic medium in which each condensate 85 is confined by a constant local elastic pressure that can 86 be different among condensates . Surprisingly , we find a 87 new dynamical scaling of the average condensate radius 88 ⟨ R ⟩ ∼ t 1 / 5 during the ripening phase induced by het - 89 erogeneous elasticity , which we denote as elastic ripen - 90 ing . The 1 / 5 exponent is beyond the 1 / 3 exponent in 91 the classical Ostwald ripening , and we derive its value 92 based on principles of energy conservation and scale in - 93 variance . We also introduce nonlinear elasticity beyond 94 the neo - Hookean model in which the ripening of conden - 95 sates can be suppressed , and multiple condensates can co - 96 exist . However , within this nonlinear model , the system 97 quickly reaches an equilibrium state without any tempo - 98 ral changes . 99 To incorporate biological activity , we assume that con - 100 densates dissolve at a rate proportional to their vol - 101 ume inspired by experiments in which RNAs can dis - 102 solve transcription - related condensates [ 36 ] . As a sup - 103 port of the active dissolution model , the simulated dis - 104 tribution of condensate lifetimes is similar to that of 105 RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) condensates in experiments 106 [ 9 ] . Furthermore , depending on the local stiffness around 107 condensates , the condensates can grow immediately af - 108 ter dissolution , grow intermittently , or be suppressed 109 entirely , which we propose to correspond to constitu - 110 tively expressed , transcriptional - bursting , and silenced 111 genes . As another support of our theories , multiple sim - 112 ulated distributions of the kinetics of transcriptional - 113 bursting genes , including the burst frequency and the 114 burst size , agree with those of transcriptome - wide exper - 115 imental data [ 37 ] . 116 Surprisingly , a subset of the intermittently growing 117 condensates with similar local stiffness can be synchro - 118 nized so that they start growing simultaneously . We in - 119 vestigate the fraction of synchronized condensates and 120 find a power - law scaling between the synchronization pe - 121 riod with the dissolution rate . Our work reveals a new 122 universality class for the ripening process of condensates 123 in a heterogeneous elastic medium and uncovers the po - 124 tential roles of chromatin elasticity in gene expression 125 regulation . 126 II . THE CONDENSATE GROWTH MODEL 127 We propose a mean - field - like model to describe the 128 growth dynamics of condensates in a heterogeneous elas - 129 tic medium ( Figure 1 ) . We assume that the condensate - 130 forming biomolecule has a fixed concentration c in inside 131 the condensates and all condensates share a common out - 132 side concentration c out . This assumption is justified by 133 phase - field simulations of condensate formation in which 134 a virtually uniform outside concentration is observed 135 ( Supplementary Material and Figure S3 ) . A uniform 136 outside concentration is biologically reasonable because 137 the typical protein diffusion constant in vivo is about 1 138 µ m 2 / s , which means that it takes seconds for a protein 139 to fully explore the space inside a cell such as nucleus 140 [ 38 ] . We assume near - equilibrium dynamics so that the 141 changing rate of a condensate’s volume is proportional to 142 the derivative of free energy with its volume , 143 ∂V ∂t = − kV 13 ∂F ∂V = kV 13 ( g − p c ) , ( 1 ) where g is the reduced free energy of condensate forma - 144 tion per unit volume , which we call condensing affinity , 145 and 146 g = c in k B T ln (cid:18) c out c 0 (cid:19) − k B T ( c out − c 0 ) . ( 2 ) Here , c 0 is the saturated concentration of phase sepa - 147 ration and g = 0 when c out = c 0 as expected ( see de - 148 tailed derivations in Appendix A ) . The confining pressure 149 p c = p s + p el . Here , p s = 2 γ ( 4 π / 3 V ) 1 / 3 is the Laplace 150 pressure and γ is the surface tension . p el is the elastic 151 pressure due to the surrounding medium , and we will ex - 152 plain its value later . The V 1 / 3 factor on the right side of 153 Eq . ( 1 ) comes from the spherical geometry . The particle 154 flux entering an absorbing sphere is proportional to its 155 radius in three dimensions : J ∝ 1 / R × R 2 ∼ R where 1 / R 156 is for the concentration gradient and R 2 is for the surface 157 area . As we show later , this V 1 / 3 factor is critical to ob - 158 tain the correct scaling of the Ostwald ripening without 159 heterogeneous elastic medium [ 13 , 17 , 18 ] . In the follow - 160 ing , we non - dimensionalize the condensate growth model 161 so that all the variables become dimensionless by select - 162 ing the energy unit ϵ 0 = k B T , the length unit l 0 = c − 1 / 3 0 163 and the time unit t 0 = 1 / ( kc 20 l 0 k B T ) . 164 3 0 1 2 3 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 10 2 10 4 10 6 10 8 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 2 10 4 10 6 10 8 10 - 6 10 - 4 10 - 2 10 0 10 2 (cid:127) € (cid:129) ‚ ƒ 0 4 8 12 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 4 8 FIG . 2 . Elastic ripening in a heterogeneous neo - Hookean elastic medium . ( a ) Visualization of simulation results based on the condensate growth model . The systems undergo ripening until only one condensate survives . Note that the positions of these condensates are generated randomly and only a small subset of condensates are shown . ( b ) During the elastic ripening , the average radius exhibits a power - law scaling with time , ⟨ R ⟩ ∼ t 1 / 5 . The elastic pressure p el = E obeys a uniform random distribution in the range [ 0 , 2 ¯ E ] . At a later time , the elastic ripening crossovers to the Ostwald ripening in which ⟨ R ⟩ ∼ t 1 / 3 . ( c ) The average local elastic pressure ⟨ E ⟩ also exhibits a power law scaling with time , ⟨ E ⟩ ∼ t − 3 / 5 . ( d ) Distributions of the normalized radii R / ⟨ R ⟩ from t = 1000 to t = 4000 with a fixed interval converge to a universal distribution , exhibiting scale invariance . The gray dashed line is the theoretical prediction ( Supplementary Material ) . Inset : the raw distributions of R at different times . ( e ) Distributions of the normalized radii E / ⟨ E ⟩ from t = 1000 to t = 4000 with a fixed interval converge to a universal distribution , exhibiting scale invariance . Inset : the raw distributions of E at different times . In ( a ) , ( d ) , and ( e ) , ¯ E = 1 . In all figures , the radii of nucleation sites R n = 1 . 5 R c where R c = 2 γ / g ini . For the case of ¯ E = 0 , we add randomness to R n so that it is uniformly distributed from R c to 2 R c to avoid deterministic dynamics . In ( b ) to ( e ) , the total number of nucleation sites is 5 × 10 5 . In this work , we mainly focus on the nucleation regime 165 of phase separation because the average concentrations 166 of condensate - forming molecules in vivo are typically 167 far from the spinodal regime [ 39 , 40 ] . We introduce a 168 fixed number of nucleation sites with the nucleation ra - 169 dius R n , which can be related to the lengths of some 170 specific DNA sequences , such as the promoters [ 12 ] . A 171 condensate is initiated at a nucleation site if the con - 172 densing affinity overcomes the local Laplace and elastic 173 pressure . Therefore , the larger R n , the easier the con - 174 densate to initiate growth . In the following numerical 175 simulations , we set c in = 10 , the initial outside concen - 176 tration c out , ini = 2 and γ = 0 . 1 . c out is calculated as 177 ( c out , ini V tot − (cid:80) Ni = 1 c in V i ) / ( V tot − (cid:80) Ni = 1 V i ) , where N is 178 the total number of nucleation sites . V i is a condensate’s 179 volume and V tot is the total system volume , which we set 180 as V tot = 10 3 N . Neither V i nor V tot include the nucle - 181 ation site volumes , which are typically very small . We 182 define R c ≡ 2 γ / g ini , where g ini is the initial condensing 183 affinity so that R c is the minimum nucleation radius for 184 the condensate to grow at the beginning of the simulation 185 in the absence of elastic pressure . 186 III . ELASTIC RIPENING 187 In the following , we use the neo - Hookean elasticity to 188 model the elastic medium in which the elastic energy cost 189 is proportional to the condensate’s volume F el = EV so 190 the local elastic pressure p el is E [ 25 ] . To mimic the het - 191 erogeneity of local stiffness in the nucleus , e . g . , due to 192 the spatial organization of euchromatin and heterochro - 193 matin , we assign each condensate a random E . In the 194 case of Ostwald ripening , corresponding to the case of 195 homogeneous E , small condensates shrink while big con - 196 densates grow as this ripening process reduces the overall 197 surface energy . During the Ostwald ripening , the average 198 and standard deviation of those survived condensates’ 199 4 radii exhibit power scaling with time , ⟨ R ⟩ ∼ σ R ∼ ( γt ) 1 / 3 200 [ 13 , 17 , 18 ] . 201 For the case of a heterogeneous elastic medium , we ex - 202 pect a similar ripening process in which condensates with 203 large E shrink and condensates with small E grow since 204 this can reduce the overall elastic energy . We simulate the 205 condensate growth model and choose a uniform distribu - 206 tion of E from 0 to 2 ¯ E where ¯ E is the average ( Appendix 207 B ) . Indeed , condensates initiated at nucleation sites with 208 large E shrink during ripening ( Figure S4 ) , and nucle - 209 ation sites with very large E may not initiate condensate 210 growth throughout the simulations due to their strong 211 elastic pressures . 212 Surprisingly , the system undergoing elastic ripening 213 exhibits a novel power - law scaling between the average 214 condensate radius and time , which crossovers to the Ost - 215 wald ripening at a later time ( Figure 2a , b and Movie 216 S1 ) . Also , the standard deviation of the condensate ra - 217 dius exhibits a similar power - law scaling ( Figure S5a ) . 218 Moreover , the average and the standard deviation of the 219 local elastic pressures also exhibit power - law scaling ( Fig - 220 ure 2c and Figure S5b ) . To summarize , 221 ⟨ R ⟩ ∼ σ R ∼ At α , ( 3 ) ⟨ E ⟩ ∼ σ E ∼ Bt − β . ( 4 ) Here , σ 2 R = ⟨ R 2 ⟩ − ⟨ R ⟩ 2 and σ 2 E = ⟨ E 2 ⟩ − ⟨ E ⟩ 2 . The av - 222 erage variable ⟨ . . . ⟩ is averaged over condensates weighted 223 by their volumes , so the contribution of dissolved con - 224 densates is negligible . We also test the non - weighted av - 225 erage by excluding dissolved condensates explicitly and 226 obtain similar results ( Figure S6 ) . α and β are the two 227 power - law exponents . As we show later , A and B are the 228 prefactors depending on the initial conditions . 229 In the following , we theoretically derive the two expo - 230 nents , based on the following relations : 231 ⟨ ˙ R ⟩ 2 ∼ ⟨ ˙ E ⟩ ⇒ β = 1 − 2 α , ( 5 ) ⟨ ER 3 ⟩ ∼ σ E , 0 ⇒ β = 3 α . ( 6 ) Eq . ( 5 ) comes from energy conservation : the dissipation 232 power per unit volume W = − ∂F ∂V ˙ V / V ∼ ˙ V 2 / V 4 3 ∼ ˙ R 2 233 must be equal to the elastic energy changing rate per 234 unit volume , which is ˙ E . Eq . ( 6 ) comes from the scale 235 invariance of the average elastic energy per condensate . 236 σ E , 0 is the initial standard deviation of E with all nu - 237 cleation sites contributing equally ( excluding sites that 238 never grow during the simulation ) . We remark that σ E , 0 239 is the only scale of the initial E distribution ( shifting the 240 E distribution by a constant does not affect the dynamics 241 of condensate growth ) . Based on Eqs . ( 5 , 6 ) , we obtain 242 that α = 1 / 5 and β = 3 / 5 . We can also obtain the ex - 243 pressions of the factor so that A = σ 1 / 5 E , 0 and B = σ 2 / 5 E , 0 244 using Eqs . ( 5 , 6 ) . Therefore , 245 ⟨ R ⟩ ∼ σ R ∼ σ 1 / 5 E , 0 t 1 / 5 , ( 7 ) ⟨ E ⟩ ∼ σ E ∼ σ 2 / 5 E , 0 t − 3 / 5 . ( 8 ) 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 2 5 10 20 (cid:127) € FIG . 3 . Elastic ripening is suppressed in an elastic medium beyond neo - Hookean elasticity . ( a ) Visualization of simula - tion results based on the condensate growth model . In this modified model , the elastic pressure increases with the con - densate radius so that p el = E + Y R where E obeys a uniform random distribution in the range [ 0 , 2 ¯ E ] and Y is a constant . Here Y = 0 . 1 . ( b ) The average radius ⟨ R ⟩ first exhibits the elastic ripening scaling and then reaches a plateau . In all pan - els , ¯ E = 1 and the radii of nucleation sites R n = 1 . 5 R c . In ( b ) , the total number of nucleation sites is 5 × 10 5 . Our theoretical predictions are nicely confirmed for the 246 average radius ⟨ R ⟩ ( Figure 2b ) , the standard deviation 247 of radius ( Figure S5a ) , the average local elastic pressure 248 ⟨ E ⟩ ( Figure 2c ) , and the standard deviation of E ( Figure 249 S5b ) . We also verify the invariance of average condensate 250 energy in Eq . ( 6 ) ( Figure S7 ) and the expressions of the 251 factors A and B ( Figure S8 ) . Our results do not depend 252 on the distribution of E ( Figure S9 ) . 253 We have used the scale - invariance assumption in de - 254 riving Eq . ( 6 ) , and the same power - law scaling of ⟨ R ⟩ 255 and σ R supports this idea . To explicitly test the scale - 256 invariance assumption , we plot the distributions of the 257 normalized condensates’ radii R / ⟨ R ⟩ at different times 258 for the surviving condensates , and they indeed overlap , 259 which means that the only length scale is the average ra - 260 dius ⟨ R ⟩ ( Figure 2d ) . Notably , the distribution of R / ⟨ R ⟩ 261 can be calculated semi - analytically , the gray dashed line 262 in Figure 2d ( Supplementary Material ) , although it de - 263 pends on the distribution of E ( Figure S10 ) . Scale in - 264 variance is also observed for the distributions of E / ⟨ E ⟩ 265 for the surviving condensates ( Figure 2e ) . During the 266 elastic ripening , the heterogeneity of local elastic pres - 267 5 sures for the surviving condensates decreases while the 268 heterogeneity of the radii for the surviving condensates 269 increases . As a result , the Ostwald ripening eventually 270 takes over the elastic ripening ( Figure 2b ) . 271 IV . BEYOND NEO - HOOKEAN 272 In a neo - Hookean medium , the elastic pressure is con - 273 stant for each condensate , and the system undergoes 274 ripening until only one condensate is left . It has been 275 shown that a nonlinear elastic medium beyond neo - 276 Hookean can suppress ripening [ 20 , 22 , 25 ] . To incorpo - 277 rate nonlinearity , we modify the elastic pressure so that 278 it increases with the condensate radius p el = E + Y R 279 where Y is a constant , in agreement with recent molecu - 280 lar dynamical simulations [ 22 ] . We find that the average 281 radius first follows the 1 / 5 elastic ripening scaling and 282 then saturates to a plateau R max ( Figure 3 and Movie 283 S2 ) . From Eq . ( 1 ) , it is easy to find R max at equilibrium , 284 R max = g −⟨ E ⟩ + √ ( g −⟨ E ⟩ ) 2 − 8 γY 2 Y . The system eventually 285 reaches an equilibrium state where multiple condensates 286 coexist with heterogeneous radii determined by the local 287 elastic pressures . 288 V . NONEQUILIBRIUM DYNAMICS OF 289 ACTIVELY - DISSOLVING CONDENSATES 290 So far , we have analyzed the ripening dynamics of con - 291 densates as the system approaches thermal equilibrium , 292 governed by the gradient of free energy . However , biolog - 293 ical systems are often out of equilibrium due to energy - 294 consuming processes . For example , transcriptional con - 295 densates can dissolve in the nucleus because of the accu - 296 mulation of transcribed RNAs [ 36 ] , and this active dis - 297 solution process makes the system depart from thermal 298 equilibrium . To investigate the effects of active dissolu - 299 tion on the dynamics of transcriptional condensates , we 300 introduce an active dissolution rate to each condensate 301 so that they have a constant rate to dissolve per unit 302 volume k dis , that is , the probability for condensate to 303 dissolve within a short time window d t is k dis V d t . We 304 assume the dissolution to be instantaneous because of 305 fast protein diffusion [ 38 , 41 ] . 306 We first study the case of a heterogeneous neo - Hookean 307 medium . To verify whether the active dissolution model 308 is biologically reasonable , we calculate the distribution of 309 condensate lifetimes from simulations and find that it is 310 similar to the experimental data of Pol II condensates in 311 live mouse embryonic stem cells from Ref . [ 9 ] , supporting 312 the validity of our model assumption ( Figure S11 ) . In - 313 terestingly , we find that the growth dynamics of conden - 314 sates can be categorized into three cases .

Understanding the kinetics of transcription 324 has been a central challenge in the study of stochastic 325 gene expression . Particularly , a bursting gene switches 326 between the active and inactive states stochastically and 327 is transcribed only when in the active state . Multiple 328 mechanisms for transcriptional bursting have been pro - 329 posed , such as histone modifications and transcription 330 factor availability [ 37 , 42 – 44 ] . Our results suggest that 331 the local stiffness of chromatin provides a mechanical way 332 to regulate transcription kinetics . 333 To test whether the transcriptional - bursting mecha - 334 6 Simulations - 1 - 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 log 10 ( normalized burst frequency ) 0 200 400 600 C oun t s Experiments - 2 0 2 log 10 ( normalized burst frequency ) 0 500 1000 1500 C oun t s Simulations - 0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 log 10 ( normalized burst size ) 0 50 100 150 200 250 C oun t s Experiments - 1 0 1 2 log 10 ( normalized burst size ) 0 200 400 600 800 C oun t s Experiments 0 1 2 3 Normalized time until burst 0 400 800 1200 C oun t s Simulations 0 1 2 3 Normalized time until burst 0 100 200 300 C oun t s Experiments 0 1 2 3 Normalized time during burst 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 C oun t s Simulations 1 2 3 Normalized time during burst 0 100 200 300 400 500 C oun t s (cid:127) !

Notably , the distributions 349 of burst frequency , size , time until burst , and time during 350 burst all qualitatively match the experimental data , par - 351 ticularly the skewness ( Figure 5 ) . These results suggest 352 that our condensate growth model with active dissolution 353 in a heterogeneous elastic medium captures some basic 354 features of transcriptional kinetics in vivo ( if not all ) . We 355 also test other parameters for the simulations and obtain 356 similar results ( Figure S12 ) . 357 Furthermore , we observe a collective behavior of con - 358 densate growth : the initiation timings of a subset of 359 bursting condensates are synchronized . When the nu - 360 cleation radius R n is small , the complete set of bursting 361 condensates are synchronized ( Figure 4d , Figure 6a , and 362 Movie S3 ) . As R n increases , a subset of the bursting con - 363 densates remain synchronized . Eventually , the initiation 364 timings of all condensates become completely uncorre - 365 lated ( Figure 6b , c and Movie S4 ) . Intuitively , when 366 the nucleation radius R n is small , the condensate has 367 to overcome a large Laplace pressure to initiate growth . 368 Therefore , condensates must wait until other condensates 369 dissolve so that the outside concentration c out is high 370 enough to overcome the Laplace pressure . While for large 371 R n , condensates can grow without the help of other con - 372 densates . We confirm that this phenomenon is generated 373 by surface tension because the synchronized growth dis - 374 appears in an artificial system without surface tension 375 ( Figure S13 ) . This emerging synchronized dynamics of 376 condensate growth suggests a mechanism of synchronized 377 gene expression based on LLPS . 378 We define an order parameter f sync to represent the 379 fraction of synchronized condensates excluding nucle - 380 ation sites that never grow . When the fraction f sync 381 equals 1 , all the condensates that can grow are synchro - 382 nized . We obtain a heatmap of f sync as a function of 383 R n and k dis ( Figure 6d ) . f sync decreases gradually as R n 384 increases , indicating a continuous transition from fully 385 synchronized to uncorrelated growth . Also , the f sync de - 386 creases as the dissolution rate k dis increases . This is be - 387 cause condensates release molecules to the environment 388 more frequently when k dis is large ; therefore , the outside 389 concentration c out is high so that the coupling between 390 condensates is weakened . 391 For the fully synchronized case ( f sync = 1 ) , we predict 392 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 5 5 . 5 6 6 . 5 7 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 10 - 7 10 - 6 10 - 5 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 1500 3000 0 2500 5000 0 1500 3000 0 2500 5000 0 1500 3000 0 1500 3000 (cid:127) 10 0 10 2 10 4 10 0 10 2 10 4 !

( a ) The temporal trajectories of condensate volumes V under a small R n , in which the initiation timings of all condensates are fully synchronized ( excluding condensates that never grow during the simulation ) . Here , R n = 1 . 2 R c . ( b ) Here , R n = 4 R c . In this case , a subset of the bursting condensates are synchronized ( inset ) . ( c ) Here , R n = 10 R c . In this case , the initiation timings of all condensates are completely uncorrelated . ( d ) The fraction of synchronized condensates as a function of R n / R c and − log 10 ( k dis ) . ( e ) The period T exhibits piecewise power - law scaling with k dis . Inset : During one period of synchronization , the average volume over synchronized condensates ⟨ V ⟩ ∼ t 3 / 2 during the growth phase , then reaches the plateau phase , and finally undergoes ripening with ⟨ V ⟩ ∼ t . Here k dis = 10 − 7 and ¯ E = 0 . 01 . In ( e ) , R n = 1 . 01 R c so that f sync = 1 for the entire range of simulated k dis . In ( a ) to ( d ) , ¯ E = 1 . In all panels , the number of nucleation sites N = 2000 . that the period T , which is the time interval between two 393 successive synchronized growth , should exhibit piecewise 394 power - law scalings with the dissolution rate k dis . We es - 395 timate the period using k dis ⟨ V ⟩ T ∼ 1 where ⟨ V ⟩ is the 396 average volume during one synchronization period in the 397 limit of zero active dissolution rate . When the dissolu - 398 tion rate k dis is large , the condensates dissolve during the 399 initial growth phase . In this regime , ⟨ V ⟩ ∼ t 3 / 2 because 400 g − p c is essentially constant [ see Eq . ( 1 ) and the inset 401 of Figure 6e ] ; therefore , T ∼ k − 0 . 4 dis . As k dis decreases , 402 the condensates can grow larger before they dissolve , 403 and the average condensate size can reach the plateau 404 phase before ripening in which ⟨ V ⟩ ∼ const ; therefore , 405 T ∼ k − 1 dis . As k dis further decreases , the system should 406 undergo ripening . If the ripening is driven by elastic 407 ripening , ⟨ V ⟩ ∼ t 3 / 5 , and the period T ∼ k − 0 . 625 dis . If the 408 ripening is driven by Ostwald ripening , V ∼ t , and the 409 period T ∼ k − 0 . 5 dis . 410 To test our predictions , we simulate the condensate 411 growth model by choosing R n = 1 . 01 R c and a small ¯ E to 412 ensure that f sync = 1 in the entire range of simulated k dis . 413 Our predictions are nicely confirmed ( Figure 6e ) . We do 414 not see a clear signature of the scaling T ∼ k − 0 . 625 dis gen - 415 erated by elastic ripening in Figure 6e . We think that 416 this is because the small range of E makes the regime 417 of elastic ripening too short to observe ( inset of Figure 418 6e ) . To test the existence of the scaling T ∼ k − 0 . 625 dis , 419 we increase the range of E and find a scaling behavior 420 consistent with elastic ripening ( Figure S14a ) . Our con - 421 clusions regarding the power - law scaling between T and 422 the dissolution rate for the fully synchronized case are 423 independent of the choice of R n and E . Nevertheless , 424 we note that the k − 1 dis and k − 0 . 5 dis scalings occur only when 425 f sync = 1 ( Figure S14b ) . This is because the plateau and 426 ripening phases only apply to a closed system of synchro - 427 nized condensates ; that is , the outside concentration c out 428 is set by synchronized condensates only . 429 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 10 - 7 10 - 6 10 - 5 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 2 3 4 5 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 2 3 4 5 (cid:127) !

Here k dis = 10 − 7 and ¯ E = 0 . 01 . ⟨ V ⟩ increases at the end of the synchronization period because of the increasing outside concentration due to the early dissolution of some condensates , which nevertheless does not affect the scaling relation . In ( d ) , Y = 0 . 1 , R n = 1 . 01 R c so that f sync = 1 for the entire range of simulated k dis . In all panels , the number of nucleation sites N = 2000 . VI . SYNCHRONIZED GROWTH BEYOND 430 NEO - HOOKEAN 431 In the medium beyond neo - Hookean elasticity in which 432 p el = E + Y R , the phase space of bursting condensates 433 shrinks while the phase space of constitutive condensates 434 expands compared with the neo - Hookean model ( Figure 435 7a , b ) . We calculate the synchronized fraction f sync un - 436 der different Y ’s and find that f sync decreases signifi - 437 cantly when Y increases ( Figure 7c ) . Because the in - 438 creasing confining pressure limits the condensate growth , 439 condensates tend to be smaller than the limiting case 440 Y = 0 , which means a higher outside concentration c out . 441 Therefore , it is easier for condensate to initiate growth 442 without waiting for other condensates’ dissolution . The 443 synchronization period T also exhibits power - law scalings 444 with the dissolution rate in the fully synchronized regime 445 ( Figure 7d ) . The main difference compared with the neo - 446 Hookean model is that the T ∼ k − 0 . 5 dis scaling disappears 447 since ripening is suppressed by nonlinear elasticity . Fur - 448 ther , the T ∼ k − 1 dis scaling does not require the condition 449 f sync = 1 anymore since the condensate volume will reach 450 a plateau value in any case due to the increasing elastic 451 pressure p el = E + Y R ( Figure 3 and Figure S15 ) . 452 VII . DISCUSSION 453 In this work , we have systematically investigated the 454 dynamical behaviors of biomolecular condensates in a 455 heterogeneous elastic medium . We introduce a mean - 456 field - like model to investigate the condensate growth dy - 457 9 namics , allowing us to track millions of condensates si - 458 multaneously . Using this novel numerical method , we 459 find a new dynamical scaling for the elastic ripening , 460 ⟨ R ⟩ ∼ t 1 / 5 , and theoretically derive the origin of the 461 1 / 5 exponent based on energy conservation and scale in - 462 variance . Furthermore , the heterogeneity of local elas - 463 tic pressure decreases over time and exhibits power - law 464 scaling as well , σ E ∼ t − 3 / 5 . Ripening is suppressed in an 465 elastic medium beyond neo - Hookean elasticity , and mul - 466 tiple condensates can coexist at equilibrium . Our theo - 467 retical predictions and numerical simulations nicely agree 468 with each other . 469 To incorporate biological activity , we also introduce a 470 constant dissolution rate per unit volume to each con - 471 densate to model the dissolution of transcriptional con - 472 densates in vivo due to RNA accumulation [ 36 ] . This 473 active dissolution process drives the system out of equi - 474 librium . As evidence of the validity of the active disso - 475 lution model , the simulated distribution of condensate 476 lifetimes is similar to experimental data [ 9 ] . Intrigu - 477 ingly , the temporal growth patterns of condensates re - 478 semble gene expression dynamics . Condensates in soft 479 regions with weak local stiffness keep growing and con - 480 tinue to grow immediately after dissolution , correspond - 481 ing to constitutively expressed genes . Meanwhile , con - 482 densates with stronger local stiffness initiate growth af - 483 ter a delay since the last dissolution , corresponding to 484 transcriptional - bursting genes , which switch between ac - 485 tive and inactive states and initiate transcription only 486 in the active state . If the local stiffness is too strong , 487 condensates can never grow , corresponding to silenced 488 genes that are not expressed . Surprisingly , the simulated 489 distributions of multiple characteristics of transcriptional 490 burst , including the burst frequency and size , nicely re - 491 produce the transcriptome - wide experimental distribu - 492 tions [ 37 ] . Our results suggest that the local mechanical 493 properties of chromatin play a key role in regulating gene 494 expression kinetics , which can be another layer of regula - 495 tion on top of the compartmentalization of euchromatin 496 and heterochromatin . 497 Notably , the timing of the growth initiation of bursting 498 condensates can be synchronized . We remark that this 499 is entirely a nonequilibrium effect due to the active dis - 500 solution process and finite surface tension . The fraction 501 of synchronized condensates depends on the nucleation 502 radius and dissolution rate . For the fully - synchronized 503 cases , the period of synchronized growth exhibits piece - 504 wise power - law scalings with the dissolution rate . We 505 theoretically derive the power - law exponents and show 506 that it is related to the power - law scalings of average 507 condensate sizes with time . In an elastic medium be - 508 yond neo - Hookean , synchronized growth is suppressed , 509 and the results are qualitatively similar . 510 Some questions remain regarding the connection of our 511 results to condensates in natural biological systems . In 512 the experiments by Cho et al . , though the lifetime dis - 513 tribution of transient condensates can be captured by 514 our model , stable and large condensates that virtually do 515 not dissolve within the experimental time window coex - 516 ist with smaller condensates that dissolve frequently [ 9 ] . 517 This indicates that the nonequilibrium dissolution pro - 518 cess of biomolecular condensates can be more complex 519 than our simplified assumptions . The coalescence of con - 520 densates is also not included in our model . Recently , Lee 521 et al . found a new dynamical scaling of ripening gener - 522 ated by the coalescence of subdiffusive condensates [ 23 ] . 523 In the future , it will be interesting to explore the inter - 524 ference of elastic ripening , driven by the gradient of local 525 stiffness and the subdiffusion of condensates themselves . 526 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 527 We thank Fanlong Meng , Zhi Qi , and Yiyang Ye 528 for useful discussions related to this work .

( 9 ) Here , µ in and µ out are the chemical potentials of the 545 condensate - forming molecules inside and outside the con - 546 densate . p in and p out are the pressures inside and out - 547 side the condensate . Next , we use the Gibbs - Duhem 548 equation , N d µ = − S d T + V d p [ 45 ] . Therefore , µ in = 549 µ 0 + ( p in − p 0 ) / c in where µ 0 is the chemical potential of 550 the condensate - forming molecules and p 0 is the pressure 551 at equilibrium in the thermodynamic limit . 552 Regarding the chemical potential and the pressure out - 553 side condensates , we have d µ out = k B T d c out / c out and 554 d p out = d µ out / c out . Here , we have used the dilute so - 555 lution assumption for d µ out and the Gibbs - Duhem re - 556 lation for d p out . Integrating c out from c 0 , the satu - 557 ration concentration at equilibrium in the thermody - 558 namic limit , we obtain µ out = µ 0 + k B T ln ( c out / c 0 ) and 559 10 p out = p 0 + k B T ( c out − c 0 ) . Combining all the above 560 results , we obtain 561 g = c in k B T ln (cid:18) c out c 0 (cid:19) − k B T ( c out − c 0 ) . ( 10 ) APPENDIX B : DETAILS OF NUMERICAL 562 SIMULATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS 563 We perform numerical simulations by solving Eq . ( 1 ) 564 using the explicit Euler method on MATLAB . In Figure 565 4d , Figure 7a , and Figure 7b , a condensate is mapped 566 to a constitutively expressed gene if more than half of its 567 growths initiate within a dimensionless time 100 since the 568 last dissolution . Meanwhile , a condensate is mapped to a 569 silenced gene if it never grows during the simulation . Fi - 570 nally , the rest condensates correspond to transcriptional - 571 bursting genes . 572 In Figure 5a , a condensate’s burst frequency is calcu - 573 lated as the inverse of the average interval between suc - 574 cessive growth initiations . In Figure 5b , a condensate’s 575 burst size is approximated as the product of its final vol - 576 ume before dissolution and half of its lifetime . In Figure 577 5c , the time until burst is calculated as the average inter - 578 val from dissolution to the next initiation . In Figure 5d , 579 the time during burst is calculated as its average lifetime . 580 In all panels of Figure 5 for the simulations , we exclude 581 the data of small condensates whose burst size is smaller 582 than a threshold 10 6 . 583 In Figure 4d , Figure 6 , and Figure 7 , we label the con - 584 densate that can grow with the largest E as the first syn - 585 chronized condensate . We then scan the condensates that 586 can grow from the largest E to the smallest E , and the 587 condensate is labeled as synchronized if over 80 % of its 588 initiation timings overlap with the growth timing of the 589 latest synchronized condensate . After all the synchro - 590 nized condensates are identified , we calculate the period 591 by finding the average interval between two successive 592 peaks of the distribution of initiation timings for all syn - 593 chronized condensates . 594 In Figure 6e and 7d , in the case of ¯ E = 0 , we add a 595 small noise ± 0 . 001 R n to the nucleation radius to avoid 596 deterministic dynamics . In the inset of Figure 6e , we ex - 597 clude the ⟨ V ⟩ data when the survived condensates’ num - 598 ber is smaller than 200 below which finite size effects are 599 significant . 600 Movie S1 : Condensates undergo elastic ripening in 601 a heterogeneous neo - Hookean elastic medium until only 602 one condensate exists . The simulation result is the same 603 as Figure 2a in the main text . In the movie , we show a fi - 604 nite number of nucleation sites , randomly and uniformly 605 chosen from the distribution of E . The same protocol 606 applies to other movies . 607 Movie S2 : Elastic ripening is suppressed in an elastic 608 medium beyond neo - Hookean elasticity . The simulation 609 result is the same as Figure 3a in the main text . 610 Movie S3 : All actively - dissolving condensates are syn - 611 chronized when R n is small . Simulation parameters are 612 the same as in Figure 5a in the main text . 613 Movie S4 : All actively - dissolving condensates grow 614 randomly when R n is large . Simulation parameters are 615 the same as in Figure 5c in the main text . 616 [ 1 ] C . P . Brangwynne , C . R . Eckmann , D . S . Courson , 617 A . Rybarska , C . Hoege , J . Gharakhani , F .
