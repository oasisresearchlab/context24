Using live - imaging methods and quantitative analysis , we examine transcriptional bursting in living Drosophila embryos . Different developmental enhancers positioned downstream of synthetic reporter genes produce transcriptional bursts with similar amplitudes and duration but generate very different bursting frequencies , with strong enhancers producing more bursts than weak enhancers . Insertion of an insulator reduces the number of bursts and the corresponding level of gene expression , suggesting that enhancer regulation of bursting frequency is a key parameter of gene control in development . We also show that linked reporter genes exhibit coordinated bursting profiles when regulated by a shared enhancer , challenging conventional models of enhancer - promoter looping .
