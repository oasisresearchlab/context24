NEUROSCIENCE Dopamine neurons encode performance error in singing birds Vikram Gadagkar , Pavel A . Puzerey , Ruidong Chen , Eliza Baird - Daniel , * Alexander R . Farhang , † Jesse H . Goldberg ‡ Many behaviors are learned through trial and error by matching performance to internal goals . Yet neural mechanisms of performance evaluation remain poorly understood . We recorded basal ganglia – projecting dopamine neurons in singing zebra finches as we controlled perceived song quality with distorted auditory feedback . Dopamine activity was phasically suppressed after distorted syllables , consistent with a worse - than - predicted outcome , and was phasically activated at the precise moment of the song when a predicted distortion did not occur , consistent with a better - than - predicted outcome . Error response magnitude depended on distortion probability . Thus , dopaminergic error signals can evaluate behaviors that are not learnedforrewardandareinsteadlearnedbymatchingperformanceoutcomestointernalgoals . W hen practicing piano , how do you know if you struck the right or wrong note ? The problem is that there is nothing intrinsically “ good ” or “ bad ” about the sound of A - sharp . It entirely depends if that ’ s the note you wanted to strike atthat time step of the song . Performance evaluation requires sensory feedback to be compared with internal benchmarks that change from moment to mo - ment in a sequence . Performance errors during musical performance ( 1 , 2 ) and speech production ( 3 ) are associated with a frontal error - related neg - ativity in the electroencephalogram that may re - late to activity in ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) dopamine neurons ( 4 ) . Yet , although dopamine neurons are known to encode reward prediction errorintaskswhereanimalsseekprimaryrewardssuchasfoodorjuice ( 5 – 7 ) , it is not known if dopamine activity also encodes error in tasks that are not learned for primary reward and are instead learned by matching sensory feedback to internal performance benchmarks ( 8 , 9 ) . Songbirdsuseauditoryfeedbacktolearntosing and have a dopaminergic projection from VTA to Area X , a nucleus required for song learning ( 10 – 13 ) . It is hypothesized that a singing bird evaluates its own song to compute an auditory - error – based reinforcement signal that guides learning — i . e . , a neural signal that “ tells ” vocal motor circuitsif the recentvocalization was “ good ” and should be reinforced or “ bad ” and be elim - inated ( 14 , 15 ) ( Fig . 1A ) . The neural correlates of song evaluation remain unknown ( 16 – 18 ) , lead - ing to alternative models of learning that do not require online error signals ( 19 ) . To test if dopamine activity encodes perfor - mance error , we recorded songbird VTA neurons while controlling perceived song quality with distorted auditory feedback ( DAF ) ( 18 , 20 – 24 ) ( Fig . 1 , B to F ) . Beginning days before recordings , a specific song syllable was either distorted with DAF or , on randomly interleaved trials , left undistorted altogether ( distortion rate 44 ± 8 % , n = 26 birds ; Fig . 1 , E and F ) . DAF was a 50 - ms snippet of sound with the same amplitude and spectral content as normal zebra finch song ( see supplementary text ) . The snippet was either a segment of one of the bird ’ s own syllables dis - placed in time ( displaced - syllable DAF , n = 10 birds ; Fig . 1E ) or a synthesized sound designed to mimic broadband portions of the bird ’ s own song ( broadband DAF , n = 16 birds ) ( 20 , 24 ) . Operant broadband DAF drives dopamine and Area X – dependent reinforcement of undistorted syllable variants ( 13 , 23 ) . Displaced - syllable DAF , when operantly delivered contingent on the pitch of a harmonic targetsyllable , resulted in similar learn - ing ( Fig . 1 , G and H ) ( 20 ) . To test for online error responses , we com - pared the activity between randomly interleaved renditions of distorted and undistorted songs . We computed the z - scored difference between target onset – aligned distorted and undistorted rate histograms ( Fig . 2 , A to D ; target onset de - fined as the median DAF onset time relative to distorted syllable onset , n = 125 neurons in 26 birds ) ( 24 ) . We defined the error response as the average z - scored difference in firing in a 50 - to 125 - msintervalfollowingtargetonset ( 24 ) . We plotted the distribution of error responses across the 125 VTA neurons and observed two distinct groups : one that did not exhibit significant error responses ( n = 108 neurons , error response 0 . 1 ± 0 . 9 ) andagroupoferror - respondingneurons ( n = 17 neurons , error response 3 . 3 ± 0 . 5 ; Fig . 2 , E and F ) that formed a distinct cluster ( P < 0 . 001 , boot - strap ) ( 24 ) . These two groups , defined as VTAerror ( n = 17 ) and VTAother ( n = 108 ) , were spatially intermingled ( fig . S1 ) . AllVTAerrorneuronswerephasicallysuppressed by DAF during singing ( Fig . 2 , A to D , G ; P < 0 . 05 in 17 out of 17 VTAerror neurons , bootstrap ) . Suppressions followed DAF onset with a latency of 58 ± 13 ms , lasted 86 ± 35 ms , and resulted on average in a 75 % reduction in firing rate ( range : 45 to 100 % ) ( 24 , 25 ) . DAF - induced suppressions during singing were highly reliable , occurring on anaverageof94 % ofdistorted trials ( range : 82 to 100 % ) . VTAerror neurons also exhibited phasic activations following the precise time - step of un - distorted songs where DAF would have occurred butdidnotoccur ( Fig . 2 , AtoD , G , andI ; P < 0 . 05 in the same 17 neurons that exhibited suppres - sions on distorted trials , bootstrap ) . Phasic activa - tions mirrored the phasic suppressions : They followedtargetonsetswithalatencyof51±20ms , lasted 62 ± 27 ms , and resulted on average in a 77 % ( range : 42 to 214 % ) increase in firing rate ( 24 ) ( Fig . 2H ) . These precisely timed phasic activations sug - gestthat undistorted target syllables are signaled as better than predicted , as if they are evaluated against an estimate of syllable quality that is di - minished by a memory of errors ( i . e . , a flexible performancebenchmark ; seesupplementarytext ) . To test if error signals are scaled by error history , we trained 10 birds in a two - target paradigm in which one syllable was distorted with a high prob - ability ( target - 1 , 49 ± 4 % ) and a second syllable with low probability ( target - 2 , 20 ± 4 % ) ( Fig . 3 , A to C ) ( 24 ) . The magnitude and reliability of phasic suppressions did not depend on error probability ( percentage of suppression : target - 1 : 59 % , range 45 to 77 % ; target - 2 : 63 % , range 20 to 100 % ; reli - ability : target - 1 : 90 % , range 82 to 100 % ; target - 2 : 86 % , range 71 to 100 % , P > 0 . 4 , rank sum tests ; Fig . 3D ) , consistent with weak scaling of dopa - minergic negative reward prediction error re - sponses ( 6 , 7 ) . In contrast , phasic activations were significantly larger following ( the more surpris - ing ) undistortedrenditionsofthehigh - probability target ( increase in firing rate , target - 1 : 67 % , range 42 to 159 % ; target - 2 : 22 % , range – 3 to 48 % , P < 0 . 001 , rank sum test ; Fig . 3E ) . Error responses to target - 2 did not depend on whether or not the preceding target - 1 was distorted and vice versa , indicating that song time steps are independent - ly evaluated against temporally aligned perfor - mancebenchmarks ( P > 0 . 05 , ranksumtestsand fig . S2 ) . More than 95 % of Area X – projecting VTA neu - rons are dopaminergic ( 11 ) . Fourteen of 125 VTA neuronswereantidromicallyidentifiedasproject - ingtoAreaX ( Fig . 1 , BtoD ) , and13outof14VTAx neuronsencodedperformanceerror ( Fig . 2 , Eand F ) .

Wequantifiedmovementwithmicrodrive - mounted accelerometers ( fig . S6 and movie S1 ) . The activity of many VTA neurons was modu - lated by movement , whichwasin turn correlated with singing .

An aversive response should persist in birds during nonsinging periods , whereas performance error should be restricted to singing . During nonsinging periods , VTAerror neurons did not differentially respond to playback of distorted and undistorted renditions of the bird ’ s own song ( normalized firing rate , dis - torted : 1 . 0 ± 0 . 2 ; undistorted : 1 . 1 ± 0 . 1 ; P > 0 . 3 , unpaired t test ) ( Fig . 4 ) and did not exhibit pauses in response to DAF ( fig . S11 ) . Confinement of VTAerror responses to singing is consistent with performance error . Performance error signals during singing are similar to prediction error signals during reward seeking ( 5 ) . Suppression of VTAerror activity af - ter distorted syllables resembles the dopamine response to worse - than - predicted reward out - comes . Activation of VTAerror neurons after undistorted syllables resembles the dopamine response to better - than - predicted reward out - comes . Thescaling ofpositiveVTAerrorresponses according to error history suggests that song is evaluated against flexible performance bench - marks . Positive reward prediction error signals are also scaled by reward prediction ( 6 , 7 ) . Final - ly , performance and reward prediction error signals could underlie similar learning mecha - nisms . Dopamine - modulatedcorticostriatalplastic - ity links external stimuli to reward - maximizing responses ( 14 ) . Dopamine - modulated corticostria - tal plasticity also exists inside Area X ( 28 ) and could similarly link each time step in the song to the specific vocalization that produces a favor - able outcome when produced at that time step ( supplementary text and fig . S12 ) . Such a mech - anism would explain the reinforcement of un - distortedsyllablevariantsinoperantDAFparadigms ( Fig . 1 , GandH ) ( 18 , 20 , 21 , 23 ) andcouldcontribute to natural song learning ( 14 ) . Yet , unlikerewardpredictionerror , performance error during singing is not derived from sensory feedback of intrinsic reward or reward - predicting SCIENCE sciencemag . org 9 DECEMBER 2016 (cid:127) VOL 354 ISSUE 6317 1279 50 % Antidromicspike Collision AreaX HVC LMAN ‘Cortical’ BasalGanglia Thalamus VTAVTAx RA RecordVTA StimulateArea X Real Time System Distorted Undistortedabc d a b c d Distorted Undistorted 100 ms Song Evaluation Songsystem Target song Song Produced AuditoryFeedback Errorsignal TH VTAx 100 µm Displaced syllable distorted auditory feedback ( DAF ) Days post hatch P i t c h ( H z ) 120 125 130 135 140 600 700 800 900 Down days Up days ∆ Pitch , Day ( Hz ) O b s e r v a t i on s - 75 - 50 - 25 0 25 50 75 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Fig . 1 .

M . Bandi , 2 Yoko Yazaki - Sugiyama 1 * Juvenile songbirds learn vocal communication from adult tutors of the same species but not from adults of other species . How species - specific learning emerges from the basic features of song prosody remains unknown . In the zebra finch auditory cortex , we discovered a class of neurons that register the silent temporal gaps between song syllables and are distinct from neurons encoding syllable morphology . Behavioral learning and neuronal coding of temporal gap structure resisted song tutoring from other species : Zebra finches fostered by Bengalese finch parents learned Bengalese finch song morphology transposed onto zebra finch temporal gaps . During the vocal learning period , temporal gap neurons fired selectively to zebra finch song . The innate temporal coding of intersyllable silent gaps suggests a neuronal barcode for conspecific vocal learning and social communication in acoustically diverse environments . T here are more than 5000 species of song - birds , each with unique species - selective acoustic features in their songs ( 1 – 3 ) after accountingforindividualvariance . Thevocal characteristicsofbirdsongs arelearned from early auditory experience with adult tutors within species - specific constraints ( 4 ) . Juvenile birds learning to sing must simultaneously balance competingcriteria : keeping their individualsong distinct from conspecifics ( 5 ) while avoiding di - vergence beyond their own species ’ song identity ( 6 , 7 ) . Both experience - dependent and innate mechanisms contribute to species - selective song learning ( 8 ) . The observed behavioral discrimina - tion ofconspecific and heterospecific vocalizations suggests innate contributions to song learning ( 9 – 12 ) . In the zebra finch , one song unique to each individual is learned during development . The songs comprise stereotyped repeats of a few syllables , called “ song motifs , ” in which syllables are separated by silent gaps . The brain circuits thatare necessaryfor songlearningand produc - tion are well identified ( 13 ) . However , the brain mechanisms for the detection of conspecific vo - calization , while also accommodating individual differences in song learning , remain unknown . We performed a cross - fostering experiment in which zebra finches were raised by Bengalese finch foster parents ( X - fostered zebra finches ) ( 14 ) . Zebra finch song syllables , excluding intro - ductory notes , showed bimodal distributions in length and were separated by silent gaps with durations of 20 to 100 ms ( Fig . 1B and fig . S1A ) . Gaps longer than 200 ms are recognized as gaps between song bouts ( 15 ) . In contrast , Bengalese finch songs included a larger number of syllables sung in variable sequence , and the distribution of syllable durations was shorter than in zebra finch songs ( Fig . 1 , A and B , and fig . S1 , B and C ) . The probability distributions of the silent gap durations in Bengalese and zebra finch songs overlapped ; however , Bengalese finch songs in - cluded a larger number of longer gaps ( Fig . 1B and fig . S1C ) . X - fostered zebra finch juveniles learned Bengalese finch syllable morphologies ( Fig . 1C ; rate of copied syllables from tutor song was greater than rate of random matching with unrelatedBengalesefinchsongs ; P < 0 . 029 , paired t test ) as well as syllable durations ( Fig . 1D ) . The durations of tutor and copied juvenile syllables showed a linear correlation ( slope = 0 . 94 , r 2 = 0 . 907 ) and no significant difference ( P > 0 . 5 , paired t test , 44 ± 6 ms versus 43 ± 6 ms , mean ± SD ) . Even the difference in syllable duration his - tograms ( Fig . 1B , bottom ) , measuredbyKullback - Leibler distance , between X - fostered and normal zebra finch songs was similar to that between Bengalese finch and zebra finch songs , whereas the difference between X - fostered zebra finch and Bengalese finch songs was much smaller thanthatbetweenzebrafinchandBengalesefinchsongs ( fig . S1C ; note thatthe Kullback - Leibler dis - tance is order - sensitive ) . Furthermore , X - fostered zebra finch songs included more syllables than normal zebra finch songs ( fig . S1B ) but consisted of a clear motif , not a variable sequence . Despite learning the syllable morphology of Bengalese finches , X - fostered zebra finches did not learn their temporal silent gaps . When they copied syllable chunks from Bengalese finch tutors , they truncated gapsthatwere longer than normal zebra finch gaps ( > 50 ms ) but copied gaps that were similar to those of normal zebra finches ( < 50 ms ) ( Fig . 1E ) . Tutor gaps were sig - nificantly longer than copied juvenile gaps ( P = 0 . 002 , paired t test , 51 ± 6 ms versus 38 ± 3 ms , mean ± SD ) . The slope of the correlation be - tween tutor and copied juvenile gap duration was shallower than for syllable duration ( Fig . 1E ; slope = 0 . 42 , r 2 = 0 . 640 ) . The distribution of gap duration in X - fostered zebra finch songs also remained closer to that of zebra finch songs , which typically do not involve gaps greater than 80 ms ( Fig . 1B and fig . S1C ) . The difference in the histograms of gap duration probability between X - fosteredandnormalzebrafinchsongswasmuch 1282 9 DECEMBER 2016 (cid:127) VOL 354 ISSUE 6317 sciencemag . org SCIENCE 1 Neuronal Mechanism of Critical Period Unit , Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology ( OIST ) Graduate University , Okinawa , Japan . 2 Collective Interactions Unit , OIST Graduate University , Okinawa , Japan . * Corresponding author .
