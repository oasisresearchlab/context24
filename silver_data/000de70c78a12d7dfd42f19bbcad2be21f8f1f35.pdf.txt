We used cryoelectron microscopy to generate a 9 - Å resolution three - dimensional reconstruction of cofilin - decorated actin filaments , the highest resolution achieved for a complex of F - actin with an actin - binding protein . We show that the cofilin - induced change in the filament twist is due to a unique conformation of the actin molecule unrelated to any previously observed state . The changes between the actin protomer in naked F - actin and in the actin - cofilin filament are greater than the conformational changes between G - and F - actin . Our results show the structural plasticity of actin , suggest that other actin - binding proteins may also induce large but different conformational changes , and show that F - actin can - not be described by a single molecular model . cytoskeleton ∣ electron microscopy ∣ helical polymers A ctin is essential for the survival of most cells because of its crucial role in cell division , locomotion , and mechanical sup - port ( 1 ) . Recent advances in X - ray fiber diffraction and electron cryomicroscopy ( cryo - EM ) revealed a “ flattening ” of the globular monomeric actin ( G - actin ) upon polymerization into filaments ( F - actin ) ( 2 , 3 ) as well as showing a multiplicity of different struc - tural states in F - actin ( 4 ) . In the cell , actin interacts with more than 100 actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) ( 1 ) that regulate the as - sembly and disassembly of different types of actin cytoskeletal networks . Despite the importance of these cellular interactions , our understanding of the alterations in F - actin structure upon interaction with ABPs is limited . A 9 . 5 - Å resolution cryo - EM reconstruction of an actin – scruin bundle from Limulus sperm revealed very large deviations in the twist and tilt of the actin subunits from their ideal positions in F - actin ( 5 ) . A three - dimen - sional ( 3D ) reconstruction ( at approximately 12 Å ) of F - actin de - corated with actin - binding domain 2 ( ABD2 ) of fimbrin showed that the ATP - binding cleft of actin in the complex was more closed than that in the control undecorated actin filaments ( 6 ) . In contrast , a 14 Å cryo - EM reconstruction of F - actin decorated with myosin Subfragment 1 did not reveal significant deviations in its structure from undecorated F - actin ( 7 ) . Cofilin / ADF proteins are essential and conserved modulators of actin dynamics in eukaryotic cells . While cofilin was originally viewed as a protein that severed and depolymerized actin fila - ments , it is now understood to play more diverse roles in regulat - ing the assembly of cellular actin pools , including the formation of stable actin - cofilin rods that are associated with neurodegen - eration ( 8 ) . Recent findings demonstrate that the activity of cofilin is modulated by almost any perturbation of normal cell physiology ( 9 ) and identify this protein as a “ functional node in cell biology ” ( 9 ) . However , our understanding of the cofilin - F - actin interaction is hampered by the absence of a high resolution structure of this complex . Results We used images ( Fig . 1 ) of frozen - hydrated actin filaments exten - sively decorated with human cofilin - 2 under conditions where there is limited depolymerization ( pH 6 . 5 ) to extract 28 , 560 short segments ( each containing 18 actin molecules ) . The single parti - cle approach to helical reconstruction ( 10 ) allowed us to select 13 , 716 uniformly decorated segments ( Fig . S1 A ) and these were used to generate a 3D reconstruction of cofilin - decorated F - actin ( Fig . 1 C , transparent surface ) . The Fourier shell correlation ( FSC ) approach to resolution determination yielded a resolution of 10 . 2 Å using the FSC ¼ 0 . 5 criterion and 8 . 5 Å using the Hen - derson ( 11 ) criterion ( FSC ¼ 0 . 143 ) ( Fig . S1 C ) . Comparisons of the actual reconstruction with the electron density map of the atomic model filtered to different resolutions showed a best match at 9 - Å resolution ( Fig . S1 D ) . A flexible fitting procedure ( 12 ) was used to generate a pseu - doatomic model ( see Materials and Methods ) of the cofilin - actin filament ( Fig . 1 C , ribbons ) starting from a solution structure of human cofilin ( 13 ) and a crystal structure of actin ( 14 ) . Cofilin interactions with the actin filament can be divided into two re - gions ( 15 ) — the upper site previously described as the G - actin - binding site and the lower site known as the F - actin - binding site ( Fig . 2 ) . The G - actin - binding site is composed of two major con - tacts , and the interface that we see is very similar to that described for a complex of twinfilin , a cofilin homolog , and G - actin ( 16 ) . Actin residues 143 – 147 and 343 – 346 interact with cofilin residues 112 – 119 located on the top of the α 4 - helix ( Fig . 2 A ) . Yeast mutagenesis experiments revealed that the R96A and K98A sub - stitutions in yeast cofilin ( corresponding to K112 and K114 in hu - man cofilin ) are lethal ( 15 ) , while peptide binding experiments mapped the G - actin - binding site of human cofilin to residues 136 – 143 and 346 – 353 of actin ( 17 ) . The C - terminal residues of actin ( 349 – 354 ) form an extensive contact with the loop 41 – 46 and the N terminus of cofilin ( Fig . 2 B ) . Alanine substitutions in residues D34 , K36 and E38 ( residues E42 , K44 , and N46 in human cofilin ) yield a mutant that is lethal for yeast , despite only small defects in F - actin depolymerization activity in vitro ( 15 ) . Deletion of five N - terminal cofilin residues is also lethal in yeast , while deletion of these residues in porcine cofilin enables it to interact with phalloidin stabilized F - actin ( in contrast to WT cofilin , which does not bind to phalloidin - actin ) ( 18 ) . Thus , the actin - binding region formed by cofilin residues 1 – 5 and 41 – 46 may not be required for cofilin attachment to the actin filament per se but rather may induce structural perturbations in F - actin that are crucial in the cell . This is consistent with the fact that the cofilin N terminus contains a critical phosphorylation site at Ser4 that regulates the activity of cofilin ( 19 ) . Authorcontributions : V . E . G . , A .

The first contact between the small loop of cofilin ( residues 154 – 158 ) is formed with actin residues 242 – 243 located at the top of Subdomain 4 ( SD4 ) ( Fig . 2 C ) . Interaction of cofilin with the 241 – 245 loop of actin , a loop that is crucial to maintaining the integrity of the filament ( 3 , 4 , 20 ) , has never been reported . Mutations in residues E134 , R135 , and R138 of yeast cofilin ( A150 , E151 , and G154 in human cofilin ) yield a protein that readily binds to G - actin but has reduced affinity for F - actin ( 15 ) . The second site involves cofilin residues 94 – 98 forming an exten - sive contact with residues 21 – 28 and 90 – 96 within SD1 of actin ( Fig . 2 D ) . The R80A and K82A mutants in yeast cofilin ( K96 and D98 in human cofilin ) possess weak F - actin - binding , impaired depolymerization activity and are lethal in yeast ( 15 ) . Residues 19 – 21 of cofilin located in the α 1 - helix interact with residues 90 – 96 of actin ( Fig . 2 D ) . At the current resolution there is a un - ique orientation of cofilin on actin . In contrast , with a substan - tially lower resolution reconstruction of cofilin - decorated actin we stated that a unique model was not possible ( 21 ) . Cofilin has been shown ( 22 ) to change the helical twist of F - actin by 5° between protomer n and n þ 1 . Thus , when cofilin is bound the rotation between protomer n and n þ 2 along the Fig . 1 .

Cofilin molecules are in red . Fig . 2 . Cofilin forms four contacts with two adjacent actin protomers .

( B ) The C - terminal residues 349 – 354 ( red ) form a bridge of density with a loop 41 – 46 ( blue ) and the N terminus ( residues 1 – 5 in black ) of cofilin . ( C ) A small loop 154 – 158 ( green ) in cofilin contacts residues 242 and 243 ( black ) of actin , while cofilin residues 94 – 98 ( blue ) interact with residues 21 – 28 ( red ) and 90 – 96 ( cyan ) within SD1 of actin . ( D ) Residues 19 – 21 ( magenta ) of cofilin also make a contact with residues 90 – 96 ( cyan ) of actin . Fig . 3 . Cofilin alters the conformation of actin protomers and the helical twist of the actin filament . When a cofilin molecule ( A ) is placed on the surface of the unperturbed actin filament ( B ) the α 1 - helix ( green ) of cofilin clashes with the SD1 of actin ( magenta arrow ) , while the α 4 - helix ( blue ) has a steric clash with SD2 of actin ( red arrowheads ) .

( E ) Uponcofilinbinding , theouterdomain of actin rotates from the F - actin conformation ( blue ribbons ) by approxi - mately 30 ° ( red arrow ) toward the opposite helical strand ( red ribbons ) . ( F ) When cofilin - deformed actin protomers ( E ) are arranged into a helical filament having the normal symmetry ( F ) , the α 4 - helix of cofilin clashes with the lower portion of SD1 of actin ( red arrowheads ) . ( G ) The clash shown in F can be resolved by rotation of protomer n þ 2 by 10° around the helical axis ( red arrow ) . Galkin et al . PNAS ∣ December 20 , 2011 ∣ vol . 108 ∣ no . 51 ∣ 20569 B I O P H Y S I C S A ND C O M P U T A T I O N A L B I O L O G Y same strand is changed by 10° . When such a twist change is im - posed upon the original structural state of F - actin ( 3 ) ( Fig . 3 B ) cofilin cannot preserve its contacts with two actin protomers because of two steric clashes — one between the α 1 - helix of cofilin with the SD1 of actin ( Fig . 3 B , magenta arrow ) , and the other between the α 4 - helix of cofilin and SD2 of actin ( Fig . 3 B , red arrowheads ) . To overcome these clashes all actin protomers in the cofilactin filament are found in a new structural state in which the outer domain of each subunit ( SD1 and SD2 ) rotates toward the opposite helical strand ( Fig . 3 C ) . Such a structural state of actin has never been observed in either G - actin or actin filaments , either naked or decorated with ABPs . Upon polymerization of G - actin into F - actin the outer domain of actin rotates by approxi - mately 20 ° , which flattens the actin molecule ( 3 ) ( Fig . 3 D ) ; the attachment of cofilin to the actin filament rotates the outer do - main of the actin molecule from its flattened position toward the opposite helical strand by approximately 30 ° ( Movie S1 ) . The sorting procedure that classified segments used for the reconstruction discussed thus far ( see Materials and Methods ) also showed the existence of other classes of structures . We character - ized approximately 17 % of segments of cofilactin filaments as having SD2 of actin completely disordered and thus not visible in a 3D reconstruction ( Fig . S1 A ) . The orientation of SD1 of actin in the reconstruction of this class ( Fig . S2 ) is the same as in the uniformly occupied set ( Fig . 1 C ) . This suggests that the specific interaction between cofilin and SD1 of actin ( Fig . 2 ) twists SD1 toward the opposite helical strand , while SD2 follows suit due to mechanical association with SD1 . We also examined whether cofilin can bind to an actin filament model composed of “ morphed ” actin protomers arranged into a filament with a normal twist of 26° between the n and n þ 2 pro - tomers ( − 167 ° between the n and n þ 1 subunits ) , as opposed to the actual cofilactin filaments , which have a twist of 36° between protomers n and n þ 2 ( and a twist of − 162 ° between protomers n and n þ 1 ) . Our modeling shows that in this case the α 4 - helix of cofilin clashes with the lower portion of SD1 ( Fig . 3 F , red arrow - heads ) . To avoid these steric clashes between actin and cofilin , actin protomer n þ 2 needs to be twisted by approximately 10 ° with respect to subunit n ( Fig . 3 G ) . This is possible due to the extensively described variability in twist within F - actin ( 23 , 24 ) . The rotation of the outer domain of actin upon cofilin binding alters the longitudinal contacts between actin protomers ( Fig . 4 ) . At 9 - Å resolution our modeling suggests that the interface be - tween the SD3 and SD4 remains similar to that in the regular state of F - actin ( 3 ) ( Fig . 4 , green and yellow spheres ) . In contrast , the interface between SD1 and SD2 of two adjacent protomers is altered in the cofilactin filament due to the approximately 30 ° rotation of the outer domain of actin ( Fig . 4 , red and blue spheres ) . A previously proposed model for the cofilin - actin fila - ment rotated the entire actin subunit to avoid the steric clash between cofilin and actin ’ s subdomain 2 ( 16 ) . The interaction be - tween residues 40 , 45 , 61 , 62 , and 64 of the lower actin protomer with their counterparts in SD1 ( 143 , 166 , 167 , and 169 ) of the protomer above it is broken , while a novel contact between Val45 and the C terminus of the adjacent protomer ( Fig . 4 , cyan ribbons ) is established . These results support our previous obser - vation , made at much lower resolution , that cofilin weakens the longitudinal contact between SD1 and SD2 of adjacent actin subunits ( 21 ) . The breakage of the interaction between Arg62 and Asp288 upon rotation of the outer domain of actin provides a simple explanation for the acceleration in the presence of cofilin of the cleavage of SD2 at Arg62 by trypsin ( 25 ) . Displace - Fig . 4 . Cofilin alters F - actin longitudinal contacts . The residues involved in contacts between the two adjacent actin protomers ( plum and tan ribbons ) in regular actin ( A ) and cofilactin filaments ( B ) are shown as colored spheres . The interface between SD3 and SD4 ( yellow and green spheres ) is not altered by cofilin and includes interactions between Glu205 , Asp241 , Asp244 , and Glu245 ( yellow ) with Asp286 , Thr324 , Arg290 , and Pro322 ( green ) , respectively . In regular actin ( A ) residues His40 , Val45 , Lys61 , Arg62 , and Ile64 ( red ) form bonds with Tyr169 , Tyr143 , Glu167 , Asp288 , and Tyr166 ( blue ) , respectively . Rotation of the outer domain of actin upon cofilin binding ( B ) disrupts all of the above bonds and introduces a bridge of density between Val45 and the C terminus of actin ( residues 370 – 375 in cyan ) . 20570 ∣ www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1110109108 Galkin et al . ment of SD2 of actin upon cofilin binding increases the distance between residues 41 and 374 of two adjacent actin protomers by 3 Å , consistent with reduction in the formation of a disulfide bond between these residues in the presence of cofilin ( 26 ) . Discussion In a recent paper ( 4 ) we showed that F - actin is intrinsically poly - morphic , and suggested that the couplings in structural changes are part of an extensive allosteric network within actin . Such allosteric couplings must place constraints on the buried actin re - sidues ( 27 ) , helping to explain the anomalous sequence conser - vation in actin . The unique alterations in actin structure observed in the presence of cofilin extend our knowledge about the plas - ticity of the actin molecule and suggest that other ABPs may induce large but different conformational changes in F - actin . A multiplicity of actin conformational states induced by different actin - nucleating proteins ( 28 – 31 ) and ABPs may allow cells to distinguish between different actin filaments . For example , if the same conformational changes are present in actin in the stable actin - cofilin rods observed in neurodegenerative diseases ( 8 ) , many actin - binding proteins might not be able to interact with such actin filaments . As we have shown here , cofilin can both substantially displace subdomain 2 of actin as well as cause it to be disordered . We have previously shown that a disordering of subdomain 2 leads to a fourfold increase in the flexibility of the actin filament ( 32 ) , and the cofilin - induced increase in F - actin flexibility by a similar amount has already been reported ( 33 ) . This change in F - actin flexibility makes simple physical sense because the resistance to bending will scale as the fourth power of the radial mass dis - tribution , and subdomain 2 forms the highest radius contact in the filament . One can reasonably imagine that the measured ( 34 – 37 ) persistence length of actin filaments ( a quantification of the flex - ural rigidity ) arises from a mixture of the many states observed in Galkin et al . ( 4 ) . Under conditions where subdomain 2 is more disordered , the filaments become much more flexible , just as one would expect that under conditions where subdomain 2 becomes more ordered the filaments become more rigid ( 3 ) . What does the model of cofilin - induced structural changes in F - actin tell us about how cofilin severs actin filaments ? A recent paper has shown that cofilin severs F - actin at the junction be - tween bare and decorated regions ( 38 ) . In the decorated regions cofilin is disrupting the longitudinal interface in the filament but also forming a cross - link that maintains this bond . The cofilin - in - duced changes in subdomain 2 of F - actin cooperatively propagate into the undecorated regions , but the absence of cofilin in these regions means that the filament will not be stable . The coopera - tive propagation of conformational changes in F - actin has been extensively observed ( 28 , 39 – 41 ) . Finally , we suggest that conformational changes within F - actin of a magnitude similar to what is observed with cofilin binding may be necessary to understand the actomyosin force - generation cycle because modifications of actin that do not affect myosin binding or actin ’ s activation of the myosin ATPase have been shown to greatly reduce or eliminate force generation ( 42 – 44 ) . It is interesting that some of these modifications place constraints on the dynamics of the SD2 - SD1 interface in the actin filament , a region that we show here is quite labile . Materials and Methods Sample Preparation and Electron Microscopy . Skeletal muscle G - actin [ 10 μ M ] was polymerized in F buffer ( 20 mM Pipes - buffer , pH 6 . 5 , 40 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM DTT , and 0 . 5 mM ATP ) overnight at 4°C . F - actin was collected in a TLX - Beckman centrifuge ( 50 , 000 rpm for 45 min ) and homogenized in the F buffer without ATP . The DNA sequence of human cofilin - 2 was amplified from a human cDNA library ( Invitrogen ) using the following set of primers : forward [ 5 ′ - attac - catggcttctggagttacagtg - 3 ′ ] and reverse [ 5 ′ - taggatccttataatggttttccttcaagtg - 3 ′ ] , containing NcoI and BamHI restriction sites , respectively . The PCR product was cloned into pET15b vector ( Novagen ) and expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) strain of E . coli . Cells were grown at 37°C to a density of 0 . 8 absorbance units and then cooled to 25°C . Protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG over - night . Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mM TRIS - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM PMSF buffer ( extraction buffer ) supple - mented with a cocktail of protease inhibitors ( Roche ) . Cells were lysed by so - nication and clarified by centrifugation . The clarified supernatant was applied to a QAE - 52 column ( 16 × 250 mm ; GE Healthcare ) equilibrated with an extraction buffer . Cofilin - 2 was collected in a flow - through fraction of the QAE - 52 column . The flow - through fraction was collected , supplemented with 200 mM NaCl and concentrated to 2 mls ( using centrifugal concentra - tors , Amicon ) . Itwas applied thentoaSuperdex - 75 16 ∕ 60 column ( GEHealth - care ) equilibrated with the extraction buffer supplemented with 200 mM NaCl . Peak fractions containing cofilin - 2 were pooled , concentrated and dia - lyzed against the extraction buffer . The concentration of cofilin - 2 was deter - mined spectrophotometrically using A ( 0 . 1 % ) at 280 nm of 0 . 985 cm − 1 . F - actin [ 4 – 5 μ M ] in F buffer was incubated with human cofilin - 2 [ 15 – 20 μ M ] for 20 – 40 min . Cryosamples were prepared using a Vitrobot Mark IV ( Gatan ) plunge freezer . Droplets ( 2 – 2 . 5 μ L ) were applied to glow - discharged C - Flat grids with 100 % humidity at 10°C . All cryo - EM was done on a Tecnai F20 microscope operated at 200 keV at a magnification of 50 ; 000 × . Images were recorded on film with defocus values from 1 . 1 – 5 . 3 μ . Image Processing . The SPIDER software package ( 45 ) was used for most image processing , but the EMAN package ( 46 ) was used to extract filament images from micrographs and the BSOFT package ( 47 ) was used to determine defo - cus values . A Nikon COOLPIX 8000 scanner was used to digitize 125 cryo - EMs at a raster of 1 . 25 Å per pixel . Initial correction for the contrast transfer function ( CTF ) was made by multiplying each image by its theoretical CTF . From these CTF - corrected images , 28 , 560 short ( 400 pixel long ) overlapping segments were extracted . The segments were down - sampled to 2 . 5 Å per pixel and reconstructed using the IHRSR method ( 10 ) . The volume was corrected for the CTF by using a Wiener filter assuming that the signal - to - noise ratio in the volume was very large , and a negative B - factor of 1 , 150 was used to am - plify high frequencies in the reconstruction . The volume was initially filtered to 10 - Å resolution . The UCSF Chimera software ( 48 ) was used to fit the solution structure of human cofilin ( 13 ) along with the structure of the actin protomer from the model of the actin filament in the “ regular ” state ( 3 ) into the experimental map . The resultant atomic model was then perturbed in various ways and used for cross - correlation sorting of the images . Fivemodelswerecreated . Thefirstmodelhadactinprotomersinthe “ reg - ular ” state but twisted to − 162 ° ; the next two models had the cofilin mole - cule tilted away from its position in the uniformly decorated filament model by15°withtheupperorlowercontacts withtheactinfilament disrupted ; the fourth was the unperturbed model of the uniformly decorated filament ; a fifth model was the same as the fourth but with a missing subdomain 2 ( SD2 ) . These volumes were scaled to 5 . 0 Å per pixel and projected onto 100 × 100 px images with azimuthal rotational increments of 4° , generating 450 reference projections ( 5 × 90 ) . The 28 , 560 cofilactin segments were down - sampled to 5 . 0 Å per pixel and cross - correlated with the 450 reference projections . A set of 13 , 716 segments ( 48 % ) was selected as similar to the uniformly decorated state , while 4 , 072 segments were assigned to the SD2 - disordered class ( 14 % ) ( Fig . S1 A ) . Both sets ( sampled at 2 . 5 Å per pixel ) were reconstructed with the IHRSR method . After approximately 30 itera - tions both sets converged to the same solution of − 162 . 1 ° ∕ 27 . 6 Å . These two volumes were corrected for the CTF as described previously . The uni - formly decorated volume was filtered to 9 . 0 - Å resolution ( Fig . 1 C ) , while the one with SD2 disordered was filtered to 10 . 0 Å ( Fig . S2 ) . Totestforthepossibility ofmodelbias , asixth “ bogus ” modelwascreated that was missing subdomain 1 . When the sorting was redone using these six models , only approximately 2 % of the segments were selected as most similar to the bogus model . In contrast , the smallest cofilin - bound subset ( with SD2 disordered ) had 14 % of the images . When this small set was used in IHRSR with a solid cylinder as a starting reference , it went to a strange symmetry of − 161 . 1 ° with a 30 . 3 Å axial rise per subunit ( in contrast to the symmetry of the bogus model , − 162 . 1 ° and 27 . 6 Å ) . A comparison between the model and the resulting reconstruction showed no significant similarity . Model Creation and Structure Refinement . For both density maps the same starting model was used for the refinement . The actin monomer structure was taken from PDB ID code 2BTF and the cofilin monomer was taken from PDB ID code 1Q8G . Atomic coordinates from these high - resolution structures were converted to density maps , filtered to the resolution of the experimen - tal map , and docked into the maps using the UCSF Chimera software .

The program CNS ( 50 ) was then used to correct the broken linkages between the fragments and remove atom clashes by energy minimization of the whole structure . During this minimization the fragments were strongly restrained , which moved them almost as rigid bodies . The starting models obtained by this procedure were then subjected to real - space refinement against the density map using the program DireX ( 12 ) . An elastic network potential was used during the refinement , wherein total 78 , 426 ( two times thenumber of atoms ) harmonic restraints where randomly chosen from the list of atom pairs that are initially within a distance of 3 to 15 Å and are separated along the main chain by not more than 30 residues . There were no restraints between the different monomers . Itshouldbenotedthattheelasticnetworkwasinthiscasechosen nottobedeformable ( i . e . , thegammavaluewassettozero ) . Elasticrestraints withinsecondarystructureelementswereweightedtwiceasstrongasinloop regions . The secondary structure assignment was computed using DSSP ( 49 ) . The DireX refinement was performed in two steps , first 200 steps of posi - tional refinement with a large stepsize to quickly move the model into the density , followed by 2 , 000 steps of small step - size refinement together with occupancy refinement . The occupancy is a value between 0 and 1 and scales the weight of each atom in the computation of the model density map to account for missing or reduced density due to flexible parts of the mole - cule . The refined structure was then further optimized using CNS software ( 50 ) with 1 , 000steps ofCartesiandynamicsat atemperatureof30Kfollowed by 300 steps minimization . For both dynamics and minimization all hydrogen atoms were added to the model and electrostatic interaction was used be - tween backbone atoms only to improve the hydrogen bonding network . In addition , statistical Ramachandran restraints were used to improve the back - bone dihedral angles . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS .

( A ) A set of cofilactin segments ( n ¼ 28 , 560 ) was sorted into four classes based on occupancy and cofilin orientation ( see Materials and Methods ) . ( B ) To determine the resolution the uniformly occupied class ( n ¼ 13 , 716 ) was randomly split into two subclasses , and these were independently iterated with the IHRSR procedure starting from different symmetry values . The two sets converged to the same symmetry of − 162 . 1 ° rotation and 27 . 6 - Å axial translation . ( C ) The correlation between the corresponding Fourier shells from the two resulting volumes is shown . A comparison between the resolutions of the overall reconstruction ( n ¼ 28 , 560 ) and the uniformly decorated class ( n ¼ 13 , 716 ) shows the improvement after sorting . The uniformly decorated set yielded a re - solutionof 10 . 2 Å using the FSC ¼ 0 . 5 criterion and 8 . 5 Å using theRosenthal and Henderson ( 1 ) criterion ( FSC ¼ 0 . 143 ) . ( D ) Actual reconstruction ( gray surface ) superimposed on the electron density map derived from the atomic model filtered to 9 . 0 - Å resolution ( actin part is solid cyan , cofilin is solid gold ) yielded an excellent match . 1 Rosenthal PB , Henderson R ( 2003 ) Optimal determination of particle orientation , absolute hand , and contrast loss in single - particle electron cryomicroscopy .
