The translation at the tissue scale of these changes has not yet been enlightened while being essential in the understanding of tumor progression . Thus , biophysical tools dedicated to measurements on model tumor systems are needed to reveal the impact of epithelial – mesenchymal transition at the collective cell scale . Herein , using an original biophysical approach based on magnetic nanoparticle insertion inside cells , we formed and ﬂ attened multicellular aggregates to explore the consequences of the loss of the metastasis suppressor NME1 on the mechanical properties at the tissue scale . Multicellular spheroids behave as viscoelastic ﬂ uids , and their equilibrium shape is driven by surface tension as measured by their deformation upon magnetic ﬁ eld application . In a model of breast tumor cells genetically modi ﬁ ed for NME1 , we correlated tumor invasion , migration , and adhesion modi ﬁ cations with shape maintenance properties by measuring surface tension and exploring both invasive and migratory potential as well as adhesion characteristics .

Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 01 TYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 30 August 2022 DOI 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 926322 Introduction In his seminal work , On growth and form ( Thompson , 1992 ) , D ’ Arcy Thompson ﬁ rst described the notion that the shapes of biological tissues are determined by physical principles . How shapes emerge from cellular interactions and their physical properties has been a central question in biology for decades . The fact that cells in suspension are observed to be round and that experimental data have shown that mixing cell populations drives cell sorting suggests the existence of a tissue surface tension ( Steinberg , 1963 ) . In ﬂ uids , both the Young – Laplace law and the Young – Dupré equation describe the shape of droplets and their wetting properties by simple force balance introducing surface tension . By analogy , in tissues , surface tension is essential to determining tissue shape ( Ehrig et al . , 2019 ; Hashmi et al . , 2022 ) . Considering cells in tissues as molecules in ﬂ uids , surface tension at the tissue scale is related to the energy difference between cells in the bulk and cells at the surface of the tissue . This ﬂ uid analogy about tissue behavior is still valid under force application : when compressed , a multicellular aggregate ﬂ attens due to modi ﬁ cation of the cell position with cells pushed to the surface ( Hayashi and Carthew , 2004 ) . This increases the actual surface area , dissipating the applied force and minimizing the overall energy ( Merkel and Manning , 2017 ; Hannezo and Heisenberg , 2019 ) . To be predictable , these macroscopic physical properties have to be correlated with more microscopic biological insights . Surface tension formally depends both on the adhesion energy between cells and on the interaction area ( Amack and Manning , 2012 ) . Cell – cell adhesion was ﬁ rst identi ﬁ ed as a key component of tissue surface tension ( Foty and Steinberg , 2005 ) giving rise to the differential adhesion hypothesis ( DAH ) postulated by Steinberg . Investigations of the DAH explored in vitro actually revealed the predominant role of actin contractility in surface tension ( Maître et al . , 2012 ) and shed light on the multitude of factors that contribute to surface tension ( Brodland , 2002 ; Krieg et al . , 2008 ; Heer and Martin , 2017 ; Nagle et al . , 2021 ) . The DAH was , therefore , extended to effective adhesion to take into account both cell – cell adhesion and cell mechanical properties implied in the surface contact area ( Manning et al . , 2010 ; Gonzalez - Rodriguez et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , surface tension has been hypothesized as being highly sensitive to any modi ﬁ cation in cytoskeletal organization and intercellular adhesion . Cells in living organisms experience physical forces , such as compression , tension , hydrostatic pressure , and shear stress ( Northcott et al . , 2018 ) . They respond to these forces by modifying their shape and by generating forces . In this regard , tumor cells behave abnormally because they have lost cell – cell adhesion and have growth defects ( Pham et al . , 2010 ; Zhang et al . , 2020 ) that give rise to abnormal shapes . Moreover , by remodeling the extracellular matrix , tumor cells can invade adjacent tissue ( Mierke , 2020 ) . Tumor progression seems to require abnormal adhesion and mechanical properties at the individual cell scale . How these cell properties translate at the collective tridimensional scale is still unknown . Tridimensional multicellular spheroids appear to be the simplest models to mimic a tissue ( Hirschhaeuser et al . , 2010 ) , especially in the context of tumors . They provide a potential tool to decipher metastatic potential as long as two criteria are met : 1 / obtaining a reproducible perfectly controlled model tissue , and 2 / identifying easily measurable macroscopic properties that can serve as a hallmark of metastatic potential . Surface tension as an index of shape generation and maintenance is an appealing candidate indicator of change in mechanical properties and , thus , the invasive potential of tumors . To measure surface tension from model tissues , one has to be able to deform them . Most techniques used to mechanically stimulate spheroids involve con ﬁ ning them either by encapsulation ( Alessandri et al . , 2013 ) , application of osmotic pressure ( Montel et al . , 2011 ) , or compression between rigid plates . Magnetic compression , by contrast , utilizes magnetic nanoparticles ( Mazuel et al . , 2015 ) to exert volume forces on the cells , mimicking the stress experienced by tumors due to extracellular matrix stiffening and abnormal tissue growth ( Mary et al . , 2022 ) . Epithelial – mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is often associated with metastasis . The transition from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype is not a simple switch ; it comprises a large spectrum of phenotypes resulting in decreased cell – cell adhesion and enhanced migration and invasion ( Pastushenko and Blanpain , 2019 ) . However , most studies on the biomechanics of tumor cells focus on malignant transformation and do not consider EMT . NME1 , ﬁ rst identi ﬁ ed as a metastasis suppressor ( Steeg et al . , 1988 ; Boissan et al . , 2005 ) , is an inhibitor of EMT ( Huna et al . , 2021 ) . Its loss induces a hybrid state of EMT intermediate between fully epithelial and fully mesenchymal states , that represents an unprecedented way to look at biophysical tool sensitivity ( Huna et al . , 2021 ) . While there are now around 30 identi ﬁ ed metastasis suppressor genes ( Khan and Steeg , 2018 ) , NME1 was ﬁ rst discovered and the most extensively characterized at the mechanistic and clinical levels . Its expression in melanomas and in epithelial tumors such as breast , liver , colon , and cervical carcinomas shows an inverse correlation with metastatic potential . This inverse relationship between NME1 expression and metastatic potential is most strongly observed in breast tumors . NME2 is a closely related isoform of NME1 . While the two proteins are 88 % identical in sequence and share many common properties , the role of NME2 is far from being elucidated . In this study , we investigate how EMT affects surface tension by inducing the loss of NME1 and one of its close isoforms , NME2 , in a purely cellular tridimensional model tissue . We also explore the relationship between surface tension and adhesion in accordance with the differential adhesion hypothesis upon NME1 or NME2 inactivation . Moreover , we explore the role of both NME1 and NME2 in such metastasis - associated biological processes as EMT , migration , and invasion by using Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 02 Nagle et al . 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 926322 a breast tumor cell line model . We also shed light on the relationship between surface tension and more dynamic parameters such as migration and invasion , which are major hallmarks of EMT upon NME1 or NME2 inactivation . We show that surface tension decreases not only during the transition from a normal to a malignant cellular state but also during tumor progression across EMT . Thus , reduction of surface tension can be used as a readout of malignant transformation and tumor aggressiveness . Materials and methods CRISPR / Cas9 gene editing CRISPR guides Lentiviral plasmid guides targeting human NME1 and NME2 were generated in the pLenti U6gRNA Cas9 - GFP - Puro vector . These vectors and the non - target guide ( pLenti CRISPR - NT CONTROL ) were purchased from Merck - Sigma - Aldrich . Two different guides were designed for both NME1 and NME2 : NME1 ( # A ) ( # HS0000009943 , target sequence GACGGGCCG AGTCATGCTCGGG ) , NME1 ( # B ) ( # HS0000009940 , target sequence GAACACTACGTTGACCTGAAGG ) , NME2 ( # A ) ( # HS0000056847 , target sequence TCATCGCCATCAAGC CGGACGG ) , and NME2 ( # B ) ( # NME2 - 0 - 76 , target sequence AAGACCGACCATTCTTCCCTGG ) . Lentiviral vectors productions and MCF10DCIS . com cells transduction These steps were performed with the help of the GIGA Viral vectors platform ( University of Liège , Belgium ) . In brief , Lenti - X 293T cells ( Clontech ) were co - transfected with pcgpV ( Cell Biolabs ) , pRSV - Rev ( Cell Biolabs ) , and VSV - G ( Cell Biolabs ) encoding vectors together with pLenti U6gRNA NME1 - Cas9 - GFP - Puro or pLenti U6gRNA NME2 - Cas9 - GFP - Puro or pLenti CRISPR - NT CONTROL . Lentiviral supernatants were collected 48 – 96 h post - transfection , ﬁ ltrated , and concentrated 100x by ultracentrifugation . Lentivirus stocks were titrated with qPCR Lentivirus Titration ( Titer ) Kit ( abm ) and used to transduce cells . After 72 h , cells were selected with 2 μ g / ml puromycin ( Cayla / Invivogen ) . Then , cells expressing GFP were isolated and cloned by FACS on a FACSaria III 4L sorter ( BD Biosciences ) . Each clone was tested by Western blotting . Clones that were negative for NME1 or NME2 expression were selected for further experiments . Sequencing Selected clones were analyzed by miSeq in order to con ﬁ rm mutations in NME1 or NME2 - coding sequences , as previously described ( Huna et al . , 2021 ) . Cell lines and culture MCF10A cells were obtained from ATCC ( CRL - 10317 ) and cultured in DMEM / F12 medium ( Gibco ) supplemented with 5 % horse serum , 20 ng / ml EGF ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 0 . 5 μ g / ml hydrocortisone ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 10 μ g / ml insulin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 50 μ g / ml Bovine Pituitary Extract ( Gibco ) . MCF10DCIS . com cell line was purchased from Asterand . MCF10DCIS . com cells invalidated for NME1 or NME2 were obtained by CRISPR - Cas9 gene editing , as described in the previous section . The MCF10DCIS . com cells and their derivatives were cultured in an advanced DMEM / F12 medium supplemented with 5 % horse serum and 2 mM glutamine . All cells were maintained at 37 ° C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . Proteins extraction and Western blotting Proteins from cell extracts were electrophoretically separated on 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) polyacrylamide gels , transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes , and probed with highly speci ﬁ c NME1 and NME2 rabbit polyclonal antibodies ( Boissan et al . , 2005 ) . Immunoblots were revealed with peroxidase - coupled secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ) Plus substrate ( GE Healthcare ) . α - tubulin antibodies ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) were immunoprobed as indexes of the cellular protein level . After a rinse with PBS , multicellular spheroids were homogenized and solubilized in ice - cold 30 mM Tris - EDTA , pH 7 . 2 , containing 1 mM DTT , 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 , 10 % ( w / v ) anti - phosphatase cocktail and 14 % ( w / v ) anti - protease cocktail ( Roche ) , for 30 min on ice , followed by centrifugation at 12000 g for 20 min at 4 ° C . The proteins in the supernatants were then quanti ﬁ ed using a Bradford assay and used for Western blot analysis . Proteins from multicellular spheroids extracts were separated on 7 . 5 % SDS – polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto PVDF membranes . After being rinsed in TBS - Tween 20 buffer ( TBST ) , the blots were blocked for 1 h in TBST with 5 % ( w / v ) non - fat dry milk , then probed overnight at 4 ° C with either E - cadherin ( 1 : 1 , 000 , Cell Signaling # 14472 ) or N - cadherin ( 1 : 1 , 000 , Sigma - Aldrich , # SAB5700641 ) speci ﬁ c antibodies . After three washes with TBST , the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase - linked anti - rabbit Ig from sheep . Peroxidase activity was revealed with a chemiluminescent detection kit ( ECL Plus substrate , GE Healthcare ) , Beta - actin antibodies ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) were immunoprobed as indexes of the cellular protein level and analysis was processed by ImageJ software . Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 03 Nagle et al . 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 926322 Atomic force microscopy Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) experiments were performed on a JPK NanoWizard ® III system ( Bruker , Berlin , Germany ) coupled to a Zeiss Axio Observer . Z1 optical microscope with a ×40 air objective mounted on a PIFOC ( Physik Instrumente , Karlsruhe , Germany ) . The AFM was equipped with an additional Z piezo scanner of 100 μ m ( JPK CellHesion ) and the FluidFM ® technology add - on ( Cytosurge , Glattbrugg , Switzerland ) . FluidFM ® micropipettes of 4 μ m aperture and 0 . 3 N / m nominal spring constant were used . Micropipettes were ﬁ rst cleaned in plasma oxygen for 2 min at 20W . They were then covered with 0 . 1 mg / ml PLL ( 20 ) - g [ 3 . 5 ] - PEG ( 2 ) ( SuSoS , Dübendorf , Switzerland ) both inside and outside the cantilever for 1 h in order to ease cell release . Micropipettes were then rinsed in ultrapure water and mounted on the dedicated holder . The real spring constant was determined using the off - contact Sader method after 5 min thermalization . Cells were cultured on several 40 mm Petri dishes ( TPP , Trasadingen , Switzerland ) in a complete medium . Suspension cells were obtained by incubation in 0 . 05 % trypsin - EDTA for 5 min at 37 ° Ctodetachthecells , followedbytrypsininactivationinacomplete medium for 30 min at 37 ° C in a CO 2 incubator . Another dish of cells was cultured in an advanced DMEM / F12 medium complemented with 10 mM HEPES buffer ( imaging medium ) before placement on the AFM stage with 37 ° C temperature control . A few microliters of suspended cells were added to the dish , and the cells were allowed to settle on the bottom of the dish for 1 − 2 min before being picked up by the micropipette using a soft contact ( 1 nN ) and pressure of − 100 mbar . Oncepicked up , thepressurewasdecreasedto − 10 mbar and the cell was allowed to rest away from the surface for 5 min . This cell was then brought into contact with a spread cell with an initial 5 nN contact force ( Figure 1A ) . The AFM height was kept constant for 60 s , and then the micropipette was retracted at constant velocity ( 5 μ m / s ) . This same cell was allowed to rest for a few minutes and then brought into contact with three different cells before being FIGURE 1 Inactivation of NME1 reduces cell – cell adhesion force .

An average number of 45 cell – cell detachment curves with at least three different cell cultures per condition were recorded . The detachment force was analyzed using JPK DP software ( 6 . 3 . 50 ) as the lowest point in the retraction curve after a baseline correction ( Figure 1B ) . Wound healing assay Cells were grown to con ﬂ uency on 24 - well plates and starved for 24 h in a serum - free medium . They were treated for 2 h with 10 μ M Cytosine β - D - Arabinofuranoside ( AraC ) to inhibit cell proliferation . After starvation , cells were scratch - wounded using a sterile 200 μ L pipette tip , and suspended cells were removed by washing with PBS twice . Cell migration into the wound was monitored every 24 h until wound closure using the ×10 objective of an Echo Rebel microscope . The bottom of the plate was marked for reference , and the same ﬁ eld of the monolayers was photographed immediately after performing the wound ( t = 0 h ) and at different time points after the scratch . A total of 30 scratches were analyzed for each condition from three independent experiments . Matrigel invasion assay Matrigel invasion assay was performed following the Transwell chamber method as described ( Olea - Flores et al . , 2019 ) . In brief , BioCoat Matrigel invasion chambers with 8 . 0 μ m PET membranes placed in 6 - well plates were used to seed cells that were previously treated for 2 h with 10 μ M Cytosine β - D - Arabinofuranoside ( AraC ) to inhibit cell proliferation . The cells were plated at a density of 1 . 25 × 10 5 cells / mL in 2 ml of a serum - free medium on the top chamber , as recommended by the manufacturer . The lower chamber of the Transwell contained 2 . 5 ml of culture medium supplemented with serum . Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 ° C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . Following incubation , cells and Matrigel on the upper surface of the Transwell membrane were gently removed with cotton swabs . Invading cells on the lower surface of the membrane were washed and ﬁ xed with methanol for 5 min and stained with 0 . 1 % crystal violet diluted in PBS . Images from 5 ﬁ elds of three independent biological replicates were taken and used for cell quanti ﬁ cation using FIJI software , version 1 . 44p ( NIH , Bethesda , MD , USA ) ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . Magnetic cell labeling Iron oxide superparamagnetic nanoparticles ( 8 nm diameter ) were obtained by alkaline coprecipitation , followed by oxidation into maghemite according to the Massart procedure ( Boitard et al . , 2021 ) . The aqueous solution was stabilized electrostatically by adsorbing citrate anions to the surface of the nanoparticles . MCF10A cells were incubated for 23 min with a solution of iron oxide nanoparticles with [ Fe ] = 1 mM supplemented with 5 mM citrate in RPMI medium ( Gibco ) , while the other cell types were incubated for 45 min in a solution of iron oxide nanoparticles at [ Fe ] = 4 mM and supplemented with 5 mM citrate in RPMI medium . The labeling medium was then discarded and replaced by a complete medium for at least 2 h before cells were trypsinized and detached . Cell proliferation after magnetic labeling was assessed using Alamar Blue ( Sigma - Aldrich ) assay . Magnetic molding Labeled cells were seeded in semi - spherical 2 % agarose molds due to magnet attraction . Agarose molds were obtained from agarose geli ﬁ cation around 1 . 2 mm steel beads ( BI 00151 , CIMAP ) as previously described ( Mazuel et al . , 2015 ) . Spheroids were incubated overnight at 37 ° C , 5 % CO 2 in a complete medium and extracted from the wells by gently pipetting the surrounding liquid . The resulting spheroids had a radius of 450 ± 70 μ m . Magnetic force tensiometer Magnetic forces were exerted by a 6 × 6 mm cylindrical neodymium permanent magnet ( S - 06 - 06 - N , Supermagnete ) . The generated magnetic ﬁ eld is almost constant over the aggregate height at around 530 mT , and the magnetic gradient [ grad ( B ) ] was 170 T / m . One multicellular aggregate was deposited at 37 ° C in a temperature - regulated tank , whose bottom interface is made of a non - adhesive treated glass slide ( 30 min incubation with anti - adherence rinsing solution from Stemcell Technologies ) . Images of the aggregate pro ﬁ le were taken using a FLIRFly camera ( Teledyne FLIR ) equipped with a 1 . 5× zoom lens and an additive 5 × lens ( Thorlabs ) through sealed glass slides . The magnet is approached at 150 μ m from the bottom of the multicellular spheroid . The equilibrium shape of the multicellular aggregate is reached after 10 min . The surface tension γ is deduced from the ﬂ attened pro ﬁ le of the aggregate by using the TensioX dedicated MatLab application ( Nagle et al . , 2021 ) . In brief , it integrates Laplace laws for capillarity and minimizes the quadratic error on the height ( h ) , width ( w ) and volume ( V ) of the spheroid ( Kalantarian et al . , 2015 ) to extract the capillary constant c (cid:1) M V grad ( B ) γ , where M V represents the magnetic moment per unit volume . Indeed , the pro ﬁ le can be described by the following equation derived from Laplace laws ( Kalantarian et al . , 2015 ) : d ϕ ds (cid:1) 2 b + cz − sin ( ϕ ) x , where ϕ is the angle of inclination of the pro ﬁ le , s stands for the arc length along the pro ﬁ le , and b is the curvature at the apex . By assessing M V Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 05 Nagle et al . 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 926322 with vibrating sample magnetometry ( VSM ) measurements , the surface tension γ can be deduced . Indirect immuno ﬂ uorescence analysis Cells in 2D monolayers grown on glass coverslips were ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 5 min , and then incubated with either anti - E - cadherin rabbit monoclonal antibody ( 1 : 200 ; Cell Signaling Technology Inc . ) or anti - Pan - cadherin rabbit polyclonal antibodies ( 1 : 100 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . The secondary antibody used was AlexaFluor 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG ( ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁ c ) . Nuclei were stained with DAPI ( ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁ c ) . Images were obtained by confocal microscopy ( Leica equipped with a ×40 water immersion objective ) . Multicellular spheroids were ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 60 min permeabilized with 1 % Triton X - 100 for 2 days . They were incubated for 24 h with E - cadherin rabbit polyclonal antibodies ( 1 : 200 ; Cell Signaling Technology Inc . ) at 4 ° C . The secondary antibody used was AlexaFluor 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG ( ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁ c ) . Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 3342 ( Invitrogen ) . Images were obtained by confocal microscopy ( Zeiss LSM780 with a ×20 water immersion objective ) . Alamar blue metabolic assay The metabolic activity of the cells was quanti ﬁ ed using the Alamar Blue assay . For nanoparticles condition , the assay was performed 2 h and 1 day after the magnetic cell labeling while control cells were not labeled . The Alamar Blue reagent ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was incubated ( 10 % in DMEM ) with each cell type for 1 h according to supplier protocol , and the signal was detected using a ﬂ uorescence plate reader ( Enspire , Perkin Elmer ) at 570 nm excitation wavelength and 585 nm emission wavelength in 96 - well plates . Statistics Graphs and statistics were processed using MatLab . Notched boxplots were used to represent the median , the ﬁ rst and third quartiles and the con ﬁ dence interval for comparison . All statistical tests were performed with a two - sided Mann – Whitney U test ( Wilcoxon test ) using MatLab . p - value is used to indicate the statistical signi ﬁ cance of the results : * , * * , * * * , * * * * , * * * * * correspond to p < 0 . 05 , p < 0 . 01 , p < 0 . 001 , p < 0 . 0001 , and p < 0 . 00001 , respectively . Results Characterization of EMT - associated biological processes driven by inactivation of NME1 Cells undergoing EMT lose epithelial characteristics and integrity , acquire mesenchymal features , and become further motile and invasive ( Brabletz et al . , 2021 ) . Thus , decreased cell – cell adhesion and enhanced migration and invasion are considered hallmarks of EMT . To obtain cell lines in which the NME1 or NME2 genes were completely and stably inactivated , we performed CRISPR – Cas9 gene editing in the human breast tumor cell line MCF10DCIS . com using two independent guide RNAs speci ﬁ c to the NME1 gene , NME1 ( # A ) and NME1 ( # B ) , and two for the NME2 gene , NME2 ( # A ) and NME2 ( # B ) . To provide a control cell line for experiments with the NME1 - and NME2 - ablated cells , we subjected MCF10DCIS . com cells to the CRISPR – Cas9 procedure but omitted a guide RNA [ No - targeting ( NT ) cells ] ( Huna et al . , 2021 ) . The ablation of the two proteins , NME1 and NME2 , was validated by immunoblot analysis in the different clones ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . NME1 - ablated cells , unlike NME2 - ablated cells , are the only cell line that lose epithelial features and acquire mesenchymal characters ( Huna et al . , 2021 ) . Speci ﬁ c loss of NME1 reduces cell – cell adhesion force AFM measurements were performed to explore modi ﬁ cations in cell – cell adhesion force by measuring cell – cell detachment after a short - term adhesion of 60 s . The inactivation of NME1 , but not of its closely related isoform NME2 , moderately but signi ﬁ cantly decreases detachment force . The measured mean adhesion force for NME1 - ablated cells is 1 . 4 ± 0 . 5 ( mean ± std ) using the NME1 ( # A ) guide and 1 . 2 ± 0 . 4 nN using the NME1 ( # B ) guide . The measured mean adhesion force for NME2 - ablated cells is 2 . 0 ± 1 nN using the NME2 ( # A ) guide and 1 . 9 ± 0 . 8 nN using the NME2 ( # B ) . The measured mean adhesion force for NT control cells is 1 . 8 ± 0 . 8 nN ( Figure 1 ) . Thus , inactivation of NME1 but not of NME2 reduces cell – cell adhesion force . Speci ﬁ c inactivation of NME1 increases directional migration In order to assess the migration of NME1 - and NME2 - ablated cells , we performed a wound - healing assay , in which a con ﬂ uent cell monolayer was breached and the degree of migration to close the wound in a given time period was determined . When comparing the wounds immediately after the scratch ( 0 h ) and 24 h later , NME1 - ablated cells treated with either guide covered over 75 % of the scratched area , whereas the NT control and NME2 - ablated cells only covered 55 % of the area ( Figure 2 ) .

Thus , directional migration induced by wound closure is increased when NME1 is inactivated but not when NME2 is inactivated . Speci ﬁ c inactivation of NME1 increases invasion into the basement membrane To investigate the functional consequences of inactivating NME1 and NME2 in MCF10DCIS . com cells , we also studied their invasion of Matrigel , a basement membrane extract . Cells were plated on top of a polycarbonate membrane covered with Matrigel , through which invasive cells could cross and invade the opposite side of the membrane ( Figure 3 ) . After 24 h of culture , the number of NME1 - ablated cells crossing the Matrigel was , on average , much higher than the number of invading NT control cells . This was true whatever the NME1 ( # A ) or NME1 ( # B ) guide ( Figure 3 ) . Inactivation of NME1 induces a 6 . 5 - fold increase in the invasion index as de ﬁ ned as the ratio of the number of invading cells to the number of invading NT control cells . By contrast , the number of NME2 - ablated cells crossing the Matrigel is similar to the number of invading NT control cells for both cells treated with the NME2 ( # A ) or the NME2 ( # B ) guide .

Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 08 Nagle et al . 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 926322 These data indicate that invasion through Matrigel is increased when NME1 is inactivated but not when NME2 is inactivated . Multicellular stimulable spheroids : From two - dimensional to three - dimensional environment Model tissues of de ﬁ ned cell type , shape and size were obtained by magnetic molding techniques to assess their 3D organization . Using superparamagnetic nanoparticles incorporated into cells through the endocytosis pathway , the cells were given magnetic properties that allowed them to behave like induced magnets that can be either driven or stimulated at will using external magnets . Viability and lack of cytotoxicity of the magnetic labeling were con ﬁ rmed using the Alamar Blue assay by measuring the unchanged metabolic activity of the cells after labeling ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . Moreover , the incorporation of magnetic nanoparticles was shown to have no impact on cell – cell adhesion , migration , or invasion ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . These magnetic forces can concentrate seeded cells in a well of determined size within 1 min . After 20 h of maturation , a cohesive , perfectly reproducible multicellular spheroid about 1 mm diameter is formed due to cell – cell adhesions . We ﬁ rst looked at the organization of the spheroids to see how the modi ﬁ cation of cell – cell adhesion is transduced at the tridimensional level . In adherent cells , epithelial integrity is disrupted upon inactivation of NME1 ( Figure 4C ) . By contrast , in tridimensional multicellular spheroids , NME1 and NME2 inactivation do not impact E - cadherin localization ( Figures 4B , D ) . Looking at protein expression , E - cadherin levels are slightly decreased by NME1 inactivation , while N - cadherin expression is increased . These results correspond to the ones observed in 2D culture ( Huna et al . , 2021 ) , though the impact of NME1 inactivation is reduced in the multicellular spheroid model compared to that in 2D culture ( Figure 4A ) . E - cadherin expression is reduced by approximately 20 % compared to the NT - controls , while it was reduced by 40 % in 2D culture ( Figure 4A ) . Looking at the N / E cadherin ratio , which is one hallmark of EMT , multicellular spheroids reproduce the tendency observed in 2D cultures meaning that the NME1 inactivation induced an increase of this ratio compared to NT - controls but while the increase is in the 2 - fold range in 3D multicellular aggregates , it was noticed in the 4 - fold range for 2D culture . As expected , the overall level of total cadherin is also decreased by NME1 inactivation ( Supplementary Figure S4 ) . Thus , a tridimensional environment modi ﬁ es the cadherin expression compared to two - dimensional models . Surface tension variations across EMT Speci ﬁ c inactivation of NME1 strongly decreases surface tension The surface tension of model tissues can be determined by ﬂ attening magnetic spheroids via a permanent magnet approach ( Figure 5A ) . For a given initial size , the ﬂ atter the spheroid looks at equilibrium , the smaller its surface tension is ( Mazuel et al . , 2015 ) . Surface tension is deduced from the ﬁ t of the aggregate pro ﬁ le ( David et al . , 2009 ; Kalantarian et al . , 2015 ) ( Figure 5B ) . Starting from the same spheroid radius , aggregates of NME1 - ablated cells , whether treated with the NME1 ( # A ) or NME1 ( # B ) guide , look ﬂ atter than both the aggregates of NT control and NME2 - ablated cells , whether treated with the NME2 ( # A ) or NME2 ( # B ) guide ( Figure 5B ) . The surface tension values of spheroids of NME1 - ablated cells are 4 ± 3 mN / m ( mean ± sd ) for cells treated with the NME1 ( # A ) guide and 7 ± 2 mN / m for those treated with the NME1 ( # B ) guide . The NT control cell aggregate surface tension value is 16 ± 9 mN / m . By contrast , aggregates of NME2 - ablated cells have a surface tension value of 16 ± 5 mN / m and 13 ± 5 mN / m for cells treated with the NME2 ( # A ) guide and the NME2 ( # B ) guide , respectively , which is close to the value obtained for the NT control cell aggregates ( Figure 5C ) . Surface tension is thus strongly modi ﬁ ed upon NME1 inactivation , while the inactivation of NME2 does not signi ﬁ cantly impact it . Surface tension decreases during malignant transformation MCF10A cells are considered a common normal - like breast cell model . These cells are derived from the benign proliferative breast tissue and are not tumorigenic ( Soule et al . , 1990 ) . From them , genetic alterations have been created to study breast tumor progression . Here we studied one of its derivatives , the in situ carcinoma cells , MCF10DCIS . com , in which NME1 or NME2 were ablated . To ﬁ nd the potential of surface tension measurements in malignant transformation , we compared migration , invasion , and surface tension of normal - like MCF10A cells to carcinoma MCF10DCIS . com cells . Directional migration is enhanced in MCF10A cells compared to MCF10DCIS . com cells ( Figure 6B ) . The migration mode in the 2 cell types differs as MCF10A cells are epithelial and migrate collectively , while MCF10DCIS . com cells migrate randomly with a more individual mode ( Figure 6A ) . The invasion of the basement membrane is not modi ﬁ ed by the malignancy state of the cells and is the same as the one measured for the NT MCF10DCIS . com control cells ( Figures 6C , D ) . In sharp contrast , the surface tension of the multicellular aggregates from MCF10A cells is signi ﬁ cantly higher than that of the multicellular aggregates from MCF10DCIS . com , 45 ± 18 mN / m vs . 21 ± 9 mN / m , respectively ( Figures 6E , F ) . At the same time , Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 09 Nagle et al . 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 926322 the detachment force of the MCF10A cells has been reported to be in the 2 . 5 nN range ( Pawlizak et al . , 2015 ) , while MCF10DCIS . com cells have a detachment force in the 2 nN range according to our data . Thus , surface tension also decreases during the transition from a normal state to a malignant cellular state . Discussion We focus on a model of epithelial – mesenchymal transition induced by the loss of the metastasis suppressor NME1 in breast tumor cells . In this model , we ﬁ rst investigated the associated hallmarks of EMT by measuring cell – cell adhesion force , cell migration , and invasion . For this , we compared three different cell lines : ductal breast carcinoma in situ that are considered control tumor cells and two derivative cell lines obtained by inactivation of either NME1 or its closely related isoform NME2 . AFM measurements show that loss of NME1 decreases cell – cell adhesion force , which corresponds well to the observed reduction of cell surface levels of E - cadherin upon NME1 inactivation ( Huna et al . , 2021 ) . Previous functional aggregation and dispersion assays in the same cell line ( Huna et al . , 2021 ) already raised the possibility of modi ﬁ cation of cell - cell adhesion but AFM measurements extend it to premature and early cell – cell links with a 60 s contact and fully quantify cell – cell FIGURE 5 Surface tension is reduced after NME1 inactivation .

Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 10 Nagle et al . 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 926322 adhesion force . The decrease of cell – cell adhesion force although moderate compared to the strong effects observed both in E - cadherin cell surface level and aggregate size after dispersion , suggests that quickly forming intercellular adhesions as well as the number of links is modi ﬁ ed by NME1 inactivation . Migration by mimicking potential diffusion properties of malignant cells and invasion constitute important read - outs for EMT ( Friedl and Wolf , 2003 ) . The loss of NME1 leads to increased 2D directional migration in a wound healing assay and 2D invasion through Matrigel , which mimics the basement membrane , in a Boyden chamber assay . By contrast , the absence of NME2 , which is highly homologous to NME1 , has no effect on cell – cell adhesion , cell migration , or invasion in the same tumor cells , indicating a highly speci ﬁ c function of NME1 in these EMT - associated biological processes . NME1 has been identi ﬁ ed as the ﬁ rst metastasis suppressor , showing reduced expression in high melanoma metastatic cells and as a suppressor of breast , liver , and colon carcinoma metastasis through mechanisms that are not yet well - understood ( Steeg et al . , 1988 ; Boissan et al . , 2005 ) . Several studies have demonstrated a fundamental role for NME1 in the promotion of endocytosis through interaction with FIGURE 6 Behavior of the normal - like MCF10A cells compared to in situ carcinoma MCF10DCIS . com cells Three parameters are studied : ( A and B ) the migrationoverascratchwoundwithin48 h , asshowninFigure2 , ( C and D ) theinvasionthroughMatrigelusingaBoydenchamberassay , asshownin Figure 3 , and ( E and F ) the surface tension of multicellular aggregates using a magnetic tensiometer , as shown in Figure 5 ( * * p < 0 . 01 ) . Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 11 Nagle et al . 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 926322 dynamin . This endocytic function of NME1 could contribute to its activity towards the regulation of cell – cell adhesion , cell migration , and invasion during tumor progression . NME1 can promote the turnover of adherents junction components , including E - cadherin , through its endocytic controlling function , which is crucial for epithelial integrity ( Palacios et al . , 2002 ; Woolworth et al . , 2009 ) . In cooperation with dynamin , NME1 also contributes to the suppression of cell migration by promoting endocytosis of chemotactic receptors at the cell surface of migrating cells ( Hsu et al . , 2006 ) . Indeed , NME1 facilitates the downregulation of activated chemotactic receptors via dynamin - mediated endocytosis , whereas the absence of NME1 increases the levels of cell surface receptors which results in oversensitized cells to chemotactic signals and elevated cell migration . Finally , NME1 promoted dynamin - mediated endocytosis of the transmembrane metalloproteinase MT1 - MMP , known as a key player in tumor invasion , resulting in a strong reduction of surface MT1 - MMP levels and a concomitant reduction of extracellular matrix degradation and invasion ( Lodillinsky et al . , 2021 ) . Thus , promoting endocytosis is a major function of NME1 that limits EMT - related processes . The physical and biological mechanisms regulating EMT and tumor progression have been determined in 2D in vitro assays , but the dimensionality of the environment is a key factor to understand tumorigenesis ( Friedl et al . , 2012 ) . Two - dimensional cultures fail to recapitulate the three - dimensional structure of a tumor . Therefore , the translation of these properties from 2D to 3D is critical and has to be explored . In a purely cellular 3D environment , cell – cell adhesions are required for the cohesion of the cell assembly . Multicellular aggregates appear to be the most appropriate three - dimensional models to study mechanical properties ( Gonzalez - Rodriguez et al . , 2012 ; Giverso et al . , 2019 ) and they represent an excellent model of the macroscopic behavior of tissues ( Costa et al . , 2016 ; Nikolaev et al . , 2020 ; Ackermann et al . , 2021 ) . Being an intermediate stage between cell monolayers and biological tissues ( Lin et al . , 2008 ) , 3D models recapitulate numerous biological processes while being more easily monitored and reproducible . We used magnetic techniques to rapidly form 1 mm spheroids for observation of the macroscopic properties of tissues ( Mazuel et al . , 2015 ) . While NME1 inactivation impairs epithelial integrity in 2D culture , this effect is not conserved in 3D as the localization of E - cadherin is not impacted in spheroids . This decrease in impact of NME1 inactivation in 3D spheroids is also re ﬂ ected in E - cadherin expression , as the lack of E - cadherin is less important in spheroids compared to NT - control cells . The 3D environment is based on cell – cell adhesion formation , thus increasing the expression of E - cadherin . Cell – cell interaction enhancement has already been observed in 3D culture environments in the context of tumor cell spheroids ( Bissell et al . , 2002 ; DesRochers et al . , 2012 ; Kim et al . , 2019 ) . E - cadherin expression is controlled both by epigenetic and environmental factors during cancer progression , while the loss of E - cadherin has been proven to be reversible in breast cancer . E - cadherin expression has been restored in tumor spheroids via the demethylation of the E - cadherin promoter in a model of breast cancer ( Graff et al . , 2000 ) . In contrast to E - cadherin , the level of N - cadherin is enhanced in these model tissues upon NME1 inactivation . Finally , the 3D environment recapitulates the overall effects of NME1 inactivation observed in 2D cultures and con ﬁ rms the intermediate EMT state of NME1 ablated cells while reducing the difference with the NT - control cells . Material properties derived from soft matter concepts reveal as powerful tools to describe and predict the behavior of living tissues ( Gonzalez - Rodriguez et al . , 2012 ) . Among them , surface tension depends mainly on adhesion and tension and is related to shape determination and maintenance . Our data show that FIGURE 7 Surface tension comparison with invasion and adhesion . ( A ) The results obtained for the surface tension of aggregates from normal - like cells ( MCF10A ) and tumoral cells ( MCF10DCIS . com and derivatives ) are reported as a function of their invasion index .

Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 12 Nagle et al . 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 926322 surface tension is strongly decreased upon NME1 inactivation but not by NME2 inactivation . Surprisingly , this decrease is more important than the one measured by cell – cell adhesion determination , and it appears to be a translating difference observed in migration and invasion assays as highlighted in Figure 7 . Surface tension is a complex macroscopic property related to effective adhesion , which considers intercellular adhesion as well as cell tension . This means that there may be some reinforcement due to the multiple impacts of NME1 both on adhesion and on cell stiffness . Importantly , epithelial cells have been shown to spontaneously convert to a mesenchymal migratory and invasive phenotype when plasma membrane tension was reduced , and that increasing plasma membrane tension was suf ﬁ cient to suppress tumor migration , invasion , and metastasis ( Tsujita et al . , 2021 ) . Remarkably , surface tension is measured in a 3D environment , and the effect of NME1 may actually be reinforced by the dimension change as cell – cell adhesion is at the heart of tissue modelling and shape maintenance . The mechanical properties of cells are regulated by their environment . While the in ﬂ uence of the extracellular matrix has been extensively studied ( Levental et al . , 2009 ; Stowers et al . , 2019 ) , the impact of cell organization and dimension is emerging as essential ( Long Han et al . , 2019 ) . Surface tension also decreases when comparing normal to tumoral state . MCF10A cells are a model of normal - like breast cells , whereas MCF10DCIS . com are in situ breast carcinoma cells . Adhesion is signi ﬁ cantly reduced during this transformation ( Pawlizak et al . , 2015 ) , and surface tension actually re ﬂ ects these changes ( Figure 7 ) . Surface tension recapitulates the evolution of cell – cell adhesion upon malignant transformation and EMT thus extending the DAH upon these processes ( Figure 7B ) . Differences in surface tension are larger . Indeed , while a 30 % increase is measured on detachment force , surface tension is actually doubled . There are two main reasons for this strengthening . First , the 3D structure strongly implicates cell – cell adhesions and may enhance adhesion changes . Second , while surface tension predominantly depends upon cell – cell adhesion , it is also affected by other biomechanical properties . The greater sensitivity of surface tension may actually reveal this multi contribution . In addition , invasion measurements appear to be highly sensitive to EMT modi ﬁ cations but fail to distinguish between cells during malignant transformation ( Figure 7A ) . Surface tension thus appears to be a full range indicator of biophysical modi ﬁ cations both in malignant transformation and EMT . While individual cell stiffness has been identi ﬁ ed as a potential biomarker of metastatic potential ( Guck et al . , 2005 ; Xu et al . , 2012 ) , surface tension arises as an indicator of malignant transformation and tumor aggressiveness that can be measured on tissue - like structures closer to the actual tumor environment than cells grown in 2D culture . This property appears to be highly sensitive to any changes in adhesion , while also being easier to measure . Abnormal cell – cell adhesion , as well as enhanced migration and invasion , stand as three major hallmarks of tumor aggressiveness . They clearly indicate tumor progression upon hybrid states encountered in EMT . Decreased surface tension appears to be an appealing fourth one . Indeed , it is highly correlated with the three major hallmarks of tumor progression in our breast tumor model . Moreover , surface tension acts as a read - out of malignant transformation ( from normal to tumoral state ) and as a read - out of tumor aggressiveness ( from tumoral non - invasive to tumoral invasive state ) in breast tumor models . Conclusion These results demonstrate that surface tension through its multiparameter dependence re ﬂ ects cell organization , mechanics , and adhesion and can serve as a sensitive indicator of the state of the cells undergoing EMT as well as through the transformation from a normal state to a malignant state . Important changes in surface tension are detectable in response to subtle phenotype changes . Surface tension proved to be highly sensitive to any changes in adhesion properties at the single - cell level while being measured at the more biomimetic scale of model tissue . We investigated the sensitivity of the magnetic tensiometer across the EMT using a model of EMT induced by the loss of NME1 . NME1 , by acting on cell – cell interactions through E - cadherin turnover , participates in the maintenance of tissue integrity and shape . Thus , surface tension can be considered a signature of tumor aggressiveness during the EMT . This new biophysical tool appears crucial in the investigation of metastatic potential in tridimensional environments .
