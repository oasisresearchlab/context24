Rab35 functions in axon elongation are regulated by P53 - related protein kinase in a mechanism that involves Rab35 protein degradation and the microtubule - associated protein 1B Villarroel - Campos , David Henríquez , Daniel R .

Rab35 is a key protein for cargo loading in the recycling endosome . In neuronal immortalized cells , Rab35 promotes neurite differentiation . Here we describe that Rab35 favors axon elongation in rat primary neurons in an activity - dependent manner . In addition , we show that the p53 - related protein kinase ( PRPK ) negatively regulates axonal elongation by reducing Rab35 protein levels through the ubiquitin - proteasome degradation pathway . PRPK - induced Rab35 degradation is regulated by its interaction with microtubuleassociated protein 1B ( MAP1B ) , a microtubule stabilizing binding protein essential for axon elongation . Consistently , axon defects found in MAP1B knock - out neurons were reversed by Rab35 overexpression or PRPK inactivation suggesting an epistatic relationship among these proteins . These results define a novel mechanism to support axonal elongation , by which MAP1B prevents PRPK - induced Rab35 degradation . Such a mechanism allows Rab35 - mediated axonal elongation
