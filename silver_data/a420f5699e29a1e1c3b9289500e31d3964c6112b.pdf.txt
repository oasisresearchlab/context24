Anillin , a Contractile Ring Protein That Cycles from the Nucleus to the Cell Cortex Christine M . Field and Bruce M . Alberts Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics , University of California at San Fancisco Medical Center , San Francisco , California 94143 - 0448 Abstract . We report the cDNA sequence and localiza - tion of a protein first identified by actin filament chro - matography of Drosophila embryo extracts as ABP8 ( Miller , K . G . , C . M . Field , and B . M . Alberts . 1989 . J . Cell Biol . 109 : 2963 - 2975 ) . The cDNA encodes a 1201 - amino acid protein which we name anillin . Anillin mi - grates at 190 kD on SDS - PAGE . Anillin is expressed throughout Drosophila development and in tissue cul - ture cells . By immunofluorescence , anillin localizes to the nucleus of interphase cells , except in the syncytial embryo where it is always cytoplasmic . During metaphase , it is present in the cytoplasm and cortex , and during anaphase - telophase it becomes highly en - riched in the cleavage furrow along with myosin II . In the syncytial embryo , anillin , along with myosin - II , is enriched in cortical areas undergoing cell cycle regu - lated invagination including metaphase furrows and the cellularization front . In contractile rings , metaphase furrows , and nascent ring canals , anillin remains bound to the invaginated cortex suggesting a stabilizing role . Anillin is not expressed in cells that have left the cell cycle . Anillin isolated from embryo extracts binds di - rectly to actin filaments . The domain responsible for this binding has been mapped to a region of 244 amino acids by expression of protein fragments in bacteria . This domain , which is monomeric in solution , also bun - dles actin filaments . We speculate that anillin plays a role in organizing and / or stabilizing the cleavage furrow and other cell cycle regulated , contractile domains of the actin cytoskeleton . C YTOKINESIS is thought to be driven by a contractile ring of actin and myosin which determines the plane of cleavage and generates the force that pinches off the membrane between daughter cells ( Salmon , 1989 ; Satterwhite and Pollard , 1992 ; Sanders and Field , 1994 ) . The orientation of this ring is governed by the posi - tions of the mitotic spindle through an unknown mecha - nism ( Rappaport and Rappaport , 1974 ) . During late ana - phase , the cell cortex changes in the region where the cleavage furrow will form . Both myosin II and the recently identified septin protein , peanut ( Neufeld and Rubin , 1994 ) , concentrate in a band around the cell equator form - ing a contractile ring . Actin filaments may also concen - trate in the ring , although in many cell types this does not occur . Many questions remain to be answered about this process , including the identity of the other proteins re - quired for assembly of the contractile ring and how its for - mation is regulated . The Drosophila embryo provides a model system for studying cytokinesis . In addition to the normal cytokinesis observed during somatic cell divisions , the early embryo Address all correspondence to C . M .

The first 14 nuclear division cycles in Drosophila embryos occur in a syncy - tium . The nuclei are originally located in interior of the egg and during nuclear cycles 8 - 10 , they migrate to the surface and form a monolayer just below the plasma mem - brane . In the ensuing syncytial blastoderm ( nuclear cycles 10 - 14 ) , the nuclei divide four times at the cortex without concomitant cytokinesis . During this period , the plasma membrane undergoes a series of movements and rear - rangements that are cell cycle dependent . During inter - phase , cytoplasmic buds appear on the embryo surface . These buds collapse as the nucleus enters mitosis and the plasma membrane invaginates around each mitotic spindle forming a transient metaphase furrow . These furrows are thought to be required for the separation of neighboring mitotic spindles ( Postner et . al . , 1992 ; Sullivan et al . , 1993 ) The actin cytoskeleton is required for both of these events . It alternately forms a cap over the nucleus during inter - phase and helps to shape the plasma membrane during metaphase furrow formation ( reviewed in Schejter and Wieschaus , 1993 ) . During interphase of nuclear cycle 14 , simultaneous membrane invaginations occur that enclose all the nuclei at the cortex and result in the formation of approximately 6 , 000 individual cells . The first stage of cellularization re - Â© The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 95 / 10 / 165 / 14 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 131 , Number 1 , October 1995 165 - 178 165 sembles metaphase furrow formation , as the plasma mem - brane invaginates down around each nucleus . The final stage consists of a contraction at the base of the invagina - tion that results in the pinching off of individual cells though these remain attached to the yolk center by thin necks until gastrulation movements occur ( Warn and Rob - ert - Nicoud , 1990 ) . Cross - sections at the base of the invagi - nating furrow resemble contractile rings in that they are enriched in myosin II ( Young et al . , 1991 ) and peanut ( Neufeld and Rubin , 1994 ) . After cellularization , cells di - vide by forming normal cleavage furrows with groups of neighboring cells entering mitosis together in mitotic do - mains ( Foe , 1989 ) . The role of the actin cytoskeleton dur - ing Drosophila embryogenesis has been reviewed by Foe et al . ( 1993 ) and by Schejter and Wieschaus ( 1993 ) . In the early Drosophila embryo , maternally expressed genes have been identified that effect metaphase furrow formation ( Postner et al . , 1992 ; Sullivan et al . , 1993 ) . Simi - larly , three zygotic genes have been identified that specifi - cally effect cellularization . These genes encode three novel proteins involved in stabilizing the hexagonal actin filament array ( Rose and Wieschaus , 1992 ; Schejter and Wieschaus , 1993a ; Schweisguth et al . , 1990 ) . A third type of mutation , pebble , allows metaphase furrow formation and cellular - ization to proceed correctly , while causing the subsequent process of cytokinesis to be defective ( Hime and Saint , 1992 ; Lehner , 1992 ) . The possiblity that a maternal contri - bution allows the furrow events prior to the first cell divi - sion to occur in the pebble mutant has not been ruled out . Despite the differences identified by mutant analysis , processes of metaphase furrow formation , cellularization , and cytokinesis in Drosophila embryos are likely to share numerous protein components including components of the actin cytoskeleton . To identify such proteins , we have used actin filament affinity chromatography and immuno - fluorescence ( Miller et al . , 1989 ) , focusing on a class of ac - tin binding proteins that localize to metaphase furrows and to invaginating membranes during cellularization . In this report , we characterize the 190 - kD protein recognized by antibody No . 8 in Miller et al . ( 1989 ) which is highly en - riched at the tips of invaginating membrane furrows . We have named this novel protein anillin ( from the Spanish anillo , for ring ) , in recognition of its ring - shaped distribu - tion in dividing cells , where it is part of the cleavage fur - row . Materials and Methods Actin Filament Column Construction and Isolation of Actin - associated Proteins Actin columns , albumin control columns , embryo extracts , and chroma - tography conditions were described previous | y ( Miller et al . , 1989 , 1991 ) . Columns were loaded and washed in A buffer ( 50 mM TrisC1 , pH 7 . 7 , 0 . 5 mM Na3 EDTA , 0 . 5 mM Na3 EGTA , 1 mM DTT , 10 % glycerol , 10 ~ g / ml each of leupeptin , pepstatin , and aprotinin ) , and then eluted stepwise with A buffer containing 0 . 5 M KC1 followed by A buffer containing 1 M KCI , 1 mM ATP , 2 mM MgCl2 . Cloning of Anillin The first anillin cDNA clones were isolated from a Lambda Zap expres - sion library ( Hay et al . , 1988 ) constructed from Drosophila ovary poly A + RNA . It was screened as described ( Huynh et al . , 1985 ) with minor modi - fications . This screen produced two related clones of 1 . 4 and 2 . 5 kb . The larger of the two was radioactively labeled using a random priming kit from GIBCO BRL ( Gaithersburg , MD ) as per manufacturer ' s instruc - tions and used to screen a second cDNA library . The second library was made from 0 - 3 h embryos in lambda gt - lO ( Poole et al . , 1985 ) . We screened 450 , 000 plaques and isolated three related positive cDNAs . The combined sequences resulted in a cDNA of 3 . 9 kb . This sequence con - tained a start codon with a good upstream start consensus . ( The four nu - cleotides upstream of the ATG start have a three out of four match to the consensus sequence found upstream of ATG ' s used as initiation codons in Drosophila . The C in position - 2 is seen in 25 % of the cases examined ( Cavener , 1987 ) ) . Northern blot analysis was used to determine the size of the anillin mRNA in RNA isolated from 0 - 2 h embryos . Because of the discrepancy in size between the cloned cDNA ( 3 . 9 kb ) and the estimated size of the mRNA ( slightly less than 4 . 3 kb ) and the lack of inframe stop codons , we were concerned that the missing 400 bp might contain coding sequence . We used a nested PCR approach to clone the missing cDNA ( Gibbons , 1991 ) from a plasmid cDNA library ( Brown , 1988 ) . Two primers comple - mentary to the cloning vector used for construction of the cDNA library and four primers taken from the 5 ' end of the existing cDNA were used . These primers were used in pairs such that the first and longest reaction was carried out using the library as a template and then used as a seed for a subsequent reactions . PCR was performed using Taq polymerase and several different reactions were cloned and sequenced because of possible fidelity problems . DNA Sequencing DNA sequencing was performed by a primer walking strategy , using fluo - rescently labeled chain terminator nucleotides with an Applied Biosys - tems 373 automated sequencing machine ( Biomolecular Resource Center , University of California , San Francisco , CA ) . Both strands were com - pletely sequenced using overlapping primers so that each position could be confirmed from at least three separate reactions . The order of non - overlapping cDNA fragments was determined by using the PCR with Taq polymerase ( Boehringer - Mannheim Biochemicals , Indianapolis , IN ) us - ing standard conditions ( Sambrook et al . , 1989 ) , and a genomic library ( Brown and Kafatos , 1988 ) as a template . Developmental Western Blot Eggs were collected at two hour intervals at 22Â°C and then shifted to 25Â°C . To examine possible protein modifications , clarified extracts were used . Extracts were prepared as previously described ( Miller et . , al . , 1989 ) . Dechorionated embryos were diluted 1 / 10 with extract buffer ; 5 mM Tris , pH 7 . 6 , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 0 . 05 % NP - 40 ( Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ) plus protease inhibitors . The extract was spun at 10 , 000 g for 20 ' and passed through cheesecloth to remove lipid . Equal amounts of protein were loaded per lane . Expression and Purification of Fusion Proteins We have used two types of fusion proteins in the experiments described here : a glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) 1 fusion protein , made using the pGEX expression vector ( Smith , 1988 ) , and 6xHis Affinity Tag proteins using the QIAexpress pQE vectors ( Janknecht et al . , 1991 ) from Quigen ( Chatsworth , CA ) . For the 6xHis Tag proteins , PCR was used to generate the appropriate restriction fragments , using standard techniques ( Sam - brook et al . , 1989 ) with Vent DNA polymerase from NEB ( Beverly , MA ) . The 6xHis fragments were cloned into the vector PQE9 using a HindlII site and a Sail site . Therefore , they contained the amino acids MRGSGSVD in addition to the 6xhistidine tag . Vectors were transformed into either competent DH5 cells ( GST fusion ) or M15 ( pREP4 ) cells ( 6xHis ) , and these cells were used to produce the desired fusion proteins as per the manufacturer ' s instructions . The GST and 6xHis fusion proteins were pu - rified on glutathione - affinity columns and Ni - NTA resin columns , respec - tively . The 6xHis fusion proteins were often further characterized and pu - rified with a Pharmacia FPLC system using a Superose 12 gel filtration column . All fusion proteins used in this study are referred to by their amino acid 1 . Abbreviations used in this paper : GST , glutathione s - transferase ; NLS , nuclear localization sequence . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 131 , 1995 166 numbers . When constructing the anillin fragments for domain analysis , the clones used to express fragments 127 - 340 , 127 - 318 , and 204 - 371 were sequenced at both ends to confirm their position within the protein . Immunological Methods The original antibody used to screen the expression library was generated in two mice by immunizing with a doublet 190 - kD SDS - PAGE gel band ( Miller et al . , 1989 ) . Rabbit antibodies were generated by immunizing rab - bits with purified GST - anillin 401 - 828 and 6xHis - anillin 1 - 371 ( Berkeley Antibody Company , Richmond , CA ) . Antibodies were affinity purified by passage over columns of immobi - lized fusion proteins . The GST - anillin 401 - 828 serum was first depleted of anti - GST antibodies by repeated passage over an Affigel 10 resin ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Richmond , CA ) containing the GST protein . When no anti - GST antibodies remained , the serum was passed over a column con - taining GST - anillin 401 - 828 . The 6xHis - anillin 1 - 37l antibody was affinity purified by passing serum over a column containing the appropriate 6xHis fusion protein . Protein columns were constructed by coupling the appro - priate fusion protein in 50 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 6 , 50 mM KCI or PBS ( 140 mM NaeHPO4 , 1 . 8 mM KH2PO4 , pH 7 . 2 , 138 mM NaCI , 2 . 7 mM KC1 ) to an Affigel 10 resin at 3 - 10 mg of protein per ml of resin as per manufac - turer ' s instructions . After the serum was loaded over the column , the column was washed extensively with PBS or the Hepes buffer plus 0 . 5 M NaCI and the anti - bodies were then eluted with either 0 . 1 M glycine , pH 2 . 1 , or 0 . 1 M Trieth - ylamine , pH 11 . 0 . The antibody solution was neutralized with an appropri - ate Tris buffer and dialyzed into either PBS or 5 mM potassium phosphate , 50 mM KC1 , pH 7 . 2 . Western blotting was performed as described ( Kellogg et al . , 1989 ) , us - ing mouse antibodies diluted 1 / 500 or affinity - purified rabbit antibodies at l - 2 ~ g / ml , with alkaline phosphatase - labeled secondary antibody . For immunofluorescence experiments , affinity - purified anti - GST - anil - lin 401 - 828 was directly labeled with tetramethyl - rhodamine - NHS ester ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) according to the manufacturer ' s direc - tions . Fixation and Immunofluorescence Two fixatives were used for Drosophila embryos . Usually , embryos were fixed in 16 . 5 % formaldehyde as described by ( Theurkauf , 1992 ) . Vitelline membranes were manually removed . For myosin II localization , embryos were fixed using a short heat treatment followed by methanol ( Miller et al . , 1989 ; Thomas and Kiehart , 1994 ) . Embryos were stained with rhodamine - anti - GST - anillin 401 - 828 at 0 . 1 - 1 tzg / ml , and in some cases also with FITC phalloidin at 0 . 1 txM ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) . After wash - ing , embryos were stained for 10 min with DAPI ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) at 2 Ixg / ml to label the DNA and were mounted in 90 % glycerol , 20 mM Tris CI , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 1 % phenylenediamine . Ovarioles were fixed and stained as described ( Theurkauf et al . , 1992 ) . Drosophila tissue culture cells were cultured at 25Â°C in D22 insect me - dium ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) . 10 % fetal calf serum was added to the media when culturing Schneider cells . Cells were washed in PBS , fixed for 5 min in 3 % formaldehyde and 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde in PBS , and permeabilized and blocked for 5 min in 0 . 1 % Triton Xd00 , 2 % albumin in PBS . They were stained and mounted as above . Actin Cosedimentation Assay ( Endogenous AniUin ) Endogenous anillin was isolated using immunoprecipitation . Anti - anillin and control ( random rabbit IgG ) antibodies were bound to protein A aga - rose beads ( GIBCO BRL ) . Approximately 10 - 15 gg of anillin antibody was added to 100 Ixl of beads previously equilibrated in IP buffer ( 20 mM Tris , pH 7 , 6 , 150 mM NaC1 , 250 mM sucrose , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM EGTA . ) Both GST anillin 401 - 828 and 6xHis anillin 1 - 371 antibodies were tested . ( See Fig . 10 for antibody locations . ) Approximately 15 Ixg of random rabbit IgG was added to 100 Ixl of beads as a control . The anti - body bead mixture was agitated gently at 4Â°C for ~ 1 . 5 h and then washed several times with IP buffer . Anillin was bound by adding various volumes of a clarified extract described previously ( Miller et al . , 1989 . ) The beads now bound with anillin were washed several times with IP buffer . Actin filaments stabilized with 10 ixg / ml of phalloidin ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) were added to the beads to a final actin concentration of 10 trM and incu - bated at RT for 20 min with an additional 10 - min incubation at 4Â°C . The beads were sedimented through a step gradient consisting of 600 ~ 1 of 30 % sucrose , 350 ixl 60 % sucrose in IP buffer for 4 min at 1 , 000 g . Proteins pelleted with the beads were fractionated by SDS - PAGE . Actin Cosedimentation Assay ( Bacterially Expressed Fragments ) The 6xHis tagged proteins eluted from the Ni - NTA columns at 1 - 5 mg / ml . They were dialyzed into PB ( 50 mM Tris C1 , pH 7 . 7 , 20 mM KCI , 2 mM MgCI2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP ) plus 1 mM DTT and 10 % glycerol . Prior to mixing with phalloidin - stabilized actin filaments , fusion proteins were clarified by sedimentation at 100 , 000 g for 10 min . Immediately after spin , fusion pro - teins and actin filaments were diluted to 100 ixl with PB containing 10 IxM phalloidin and incubated for 15 min at 25Â°C with occasional agitation . The final concentration of actin was 20 tzM . The final concentration of the fu - sion proteins ranged from 15 - 100 IxM . The samples were then layered over 100 ~ 1 of PB containing 40 % glycerol and sedimented at 100 , 000 g for 10 min . Supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Actin Filament Bundling Assay The 6xHis tagged proteins prepared as above were mixed with actin fila - ments stabilized with equimolar TRITC - labeled phalloidin ( Sigma Chem - ical Co . ) . Final concentrations were 3 . 5 IxM actin and 0 . 2 - 3 txM anillin fragment . After 15 min the reactions were diluted 100 - fold into PB con - taining 60 % glycerol and 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde and observed immediately by fluorescence microscopy . For protein 127 - 371 , the experiment was re - peated with protein further purified by gel filtration ( see below ) with identical results . Actin The actin used for affinity chromatography , cosedimentation experiments , and bundling experiments was rabbit skeletal muscle actin prepared as in ( Pardee and Spudich , 1982 ) . Phalloidin - stabilized actin filaments were prepared by mixing G - actin with polymerization buffer ( PB ) , 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 6 , 20 mM KCI , 2 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP . Filaments were allowed to polymerize for 15 min at 4Â°C , and then stabilized with 10 Ixg / ml of phal - loidin . Analytical Ultracentrifugation The 6xHis protein 127 - 371 was purified by Ni - NTA chromatography and then subjected to FPLC gel filtration ( Superose 12 ; Pharmacia Fine Chemicals , Piseataway , NJ ) in 50 mM Tris C1 , pH 7 . 7 , 20 mM KCI , 2 mM MgCI2 , and 1 mM DTT . The protein eluted in a single , symmetrical peak . Two different fractions from this peak were subjected to equilibrium ul - tracentrifugation in a Beckman XL - A analytical ultra centrifuge at two different protein concentrations ( 20 and 30 p . M ) . Protein molecular weight and polydispersity were determined from plots of ODes0 vs . radius using the Beckman software . Results Anillin Cloning and Sequencing Mouse polyclonal antibody No . 8 ( Miller et al . , 1989 ) was used to screen Drosophila ovary cDNA expression library ( Hay et al . , 1988 ) . Two positive clones were isolated and found to be related by Southern blot analysis . One of these was used to probe a second cDNA library ( Poole et al . , 1985 ) to obtain additional coding sequence . The 5 ' end of the cDNA was cloned using nested PCR as described in Materials and Methods . The products of this PCR were a ladder of four related fragments , the largest of which indi - cated we were missing at most 200 bp at the 5 ' end . The se - quencing of these fragments generated an additional 165 bp of non - coding sequence . The full - length cDNA sequence of anillin ( 4 . 029 kb ) ( Fig . 1 ) is similar in size to the transcript detected by Field and Alberts Anillin , a Contractile Ring Protein 167 GG CXa . rr ~ c ~ C ~ C C ~ ro . ~ C ~ C ~ SCC ~ ccSCCC ~ ~ C G ~ aO .

Anillin is a closely spaced doublet in the 500 mM elution that migrates at 190 kD . The next section ( lanes 1 - 4 ) is a Western blot characterizing the anillin antibodies used in this paper . The first three lanes are loaded with the 500 mM column elution and probed with three different anti - anillin antibodies .

Embryos were probed with rhodamine - anti - anillin ( an - illin column ) and FITC - phalloidin ( actin column ) . The column in color shows a merged image ( anillin in red , actin filaments in green , colocalization in yellow ) . Row A shows the surface of a syncytial embryo during interphase : aniUin is enriched in a ring that surrounds the actin cap ( arrowheads ) and in a meshwork between the actin caps ( arrows ) . Row B shows a sagittal section of a syncytial embryo during prophase as the metaphase furrows begin to form : anillin is enriched in the invaginating membrane tips . Row C shows a sagittal section of a syncytial embryo during pole cell formation : anillin is enriched at the base of the pole cells . Row D shows a sagittal section of an embryo during cellularization : anillin is enriched in the invaginating membrane tips . Row E shows a view near the surface of a gas - trulating embryo in a mitotic domain : anillin is enriched in cleavage furrows ( arrows ) . Anillin is also localized in nuclei during inter - phase ( marked n ) . Field and Alberts Anillin , a Contractile Ring Protein 169 sequence predicted for anillin shows it has no significant homology to any protein in the database . Notable se - quences motifs include a 300 amino acid region of rela - tively high proline content ( amino acids 208 - 509 , 14 % proline ) . Contained within this region are two sequences ( dotted underline ) that fit the consensus for an SH3 bind - ing site ( Ren et al . , 1993 ; Yu et al . , 1994 ; Lim et al . , 1994 ) . There are also three sequences ( boxed ) that fit the consen - sus for a bipartite nuclear localization signal ( Dingwall and Laskey , 1991 ) . To confirm that we had cloned the correct cDNA , rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against two separate portions of the protein encoded by the cDNA ( for these antigen locations , see fragments with asterisks in Fig . 10 A ) . Affinity - purified antibodies were used for both West - ern blotting and immunofluorescence studies . Both the two rabbit antibodies and the original mouse antibody rec - ognize a protein that binds to actin filament columns and runs as a closely spaced doublet of ~ 190 kD on SDS - PAGE ( Fig . 2 , lanes 1 - 4 ) . All of the antibodies also recog - nize the same structures in Drosophila embryos and tissue culture cells , as judged by immunofluorescence . The predicted mass of anillin is 132 kD with an isoelec - tric point of 5 . 6 , though the protein migrates at 190 kD on SDS gels ( Fig . 2 ) . Mobility on SDS - PAGE slower than predicted from sequence is a common anomaly ( see for example Himmler et al . , 1989 ) . Many of the proteins ex - hibiting this phenomenon do not fold to form typical glob - ular proteins . At least one of our fusion proteins ( fragment 354 - 693 ) also migrates larger ( 55 kD ) than its predicted molecular weight ( 38 kD ) . Anillin Expression We examined anillin expression pattern by performing a developmental Western blot on low - speed supernatants of embryonic , larval and adult extracts ( Fig . 2 , third panel ) Anillin expression was detected at all stages and its appar - ent molecular weight was constant . In early embryos we detected hints of an anillin species with slightly decreased gel mobility ( Fig . 2 , lanes 0 - 2 and 2 - 4 ) . This might repre - sent a phosphorylated form , but further experiments are required to address this possibility . Embryonic protein ex - pression levels in general correlated with levels of cell divi - Figure 4 . Anillin localization in Drosophila tissue culture cells . The top row ( a - c ) shows conventional immunofluorescence imaging of cells that have been probed for anillin ( a , red and yellow ) , actin filaments ( b , green ) , and DNA ( c , blue ) . The cell on the left is in anaphase : anillin is enriched in the cleavage furrow .

The cell in metaphase ( M ) in d shows anillin in the cytoplasm and colocalizing with actin fil - aments in the cortex . Cells in anaphase ( A ) show an enrichment of anillin in the cleavage furrow ( e and f ) . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 131 , 1995 170 sion , being reduced later in embryogenesis . In this experi - ment we analyzed low - speed supernatants of embryo extracts because total embryo extract in SDS gave irrepro - ducible gel mobility . During embryonic stages most of the anillin was soluble . However , in ovaries the low levels of anillin in the extract was in fact due to it being insoluble ( Fig . 2 , last panel ) . Anillin solubility in larvae , pupae , and adults was not tested . Anillin Localization during the Syncytial Blastoderm Stages and Cellularization Using the above antibodies , we have analysed anillin local - ization during the early stages of Drosophila embryogene - sis and compared its localization to that of actin filaments . During interphase of the syncytial blastoderm stages ( nu - clear cycles 10 to 14 ) , the majority of the cortical actin fila - ments form a cap above the nucleus . Although some anil - lin is found colocalizing in this cap , anillin is enriched around the cap perimeter , forming a ring near the region where the future metaphase furrow will form ( Fig . 3 A , ar - rowheads ) . Some anillin is also seen in a meshwork which extends between the actin caps ( Fig . 3 A , arrows ) . As a metaphase furrow begins to invaginate around each nu - cleus during prophase , anillin is highly enriched at the fur - row tips ( Fig . 3 B ) . Pole cell formation , the pinching off of the progenitors of the germ cells occurs during nuclear cycle 10 . This is also a specialized cleavage event ( Warn et al . , 1985 ) . Actin filaments are enriched in the cortex of the nascent germ cells , while anillin is enriched in the cortex at the base of the cells . ( Fig . 3 C ) . At the final stages of pinching off , a contractile - ring like staining by anillin was observed ( not shown ) . During cellularization , anillin is concentrated at the tips of the invaginating membranes that form the cellulariza - tion front ( Fig . 3 D ) . Anillin is also enriched in the residual intercellular connections that occur at the base of each cell after the contraction that forms the individual cell is com - plete ( not shown ) . AniUin Localization in Dividing Cells We next examined anillin localization during the cytokine - sis events that occur when normal somatic cells divide dur - ing early gastrulation . In dividing cells , anillin concen - trates preferentially in the cleavage furrow ( Fig . 3 E , arrows ) . During interphase in these cells , we observed nu - clear staining ( Fig . 3 E , n ) . In all of the dividing cells we observed , during or after gastrulation , including imaginal discs and neuronal precursors , anillin was found to alter - nate between a nuclear localization during interphase and a cortex / cleavage furrow localization during mitosis ( see also Fig . 7 ) . This contrasts sharply with the results in ear - lier syncytial stage embryos , where only a cytoskeletal lo - calization is seen . The cell cycle dependent changes in anillin localization are particularly clear in tissue culture cells . Fig . 4 ( A - C ) shows Schneider cells triple labeled with probes for anillin ( A ) , actin filaments ( B ) , and DNA ( C ) . Fig . 4 ( D - F ) shows several fields of cells double labeled to detect aniUin ( red ) and actin filaments ( green ) .

( A ) Anillin concentration in the nucleus as measured by relative fluo - rescence intensity is plotted with respect to the age of cell since the previous cell division . There is a direct correlation between the age of the nucleus and amount of anillin fluorescence it con - tains . This correlation decreases after approximately 2 . 5 - 3 h ( Â© Schneider cells , [ ] KC cells ) . ( B ) A model of cell cycle dependent anillin localization . Cells enter the cell cycle and begin importing anillin into their nuclei in interphase . Nuclear envelope break - down in prophase releases anillin to the cytoplasm where it moves to the cortex . During anaphase , anillin concentrates in the area of the prospective cleavage furrow and later is enriched in the cleavage furrow . During late telophase anillin lingers in the intercellular bridge that connects the two daughter cells . Cells that pause in the cell cycle and enter Go , degrade their anillin . pear yellow . In interphase Schneider cells , anillin is re - stricted to the nucleus except for residual midbody stain - ing in recently divided cells ( Fig . 4 A ) . The intensity of the nuclear staining was strikingly variable ( Fig . 4 , D - F , I ) . Nuclear staining appeared weakest in recently divided cells ( identified by their residual mid - bodies ) , Upon nu - clear envelope breakdown at prophase , anillin becomes cytoplasmic and then moves to the actin filaments in the cortex ( Fig . 4 D , M ) . At the onset of anaphase , anillin starts to concentrate in the area of the prospective con - Field and Alberts Anillin , a Contractile Ring Protein 171 Figure 6 .

Bar , 5 ~ m . tractile ring , and it is restricted to the contractile ring dur - ing anaphase ( Fig . 4 , E and F , A ) . This pattern persists in telophase as the contractile ring pinches off , and anillin lingers in the intercellular bridge that connects the two daughter cells . In recently dividing cells , anillin begins to accumulate inside the nucleus in a diffuse staining pattern , restarting the cycle again . To follow anillin levels more precisely during the cell cy - cle , we filmed Drosophila Schneider cells and KC cells grown on marked coverslips . We then fixed the cells and used immunofluorescence to visualize anillin . Confocal microscopy was used to quantitate the amount of fluores - cence present in nuclei and to plot it with respect to the age of the cell as determined from the video record . For the first 2 - 3 h of interphase , there is an increase in anillin fluorescence in the nucleus ( Fig . 5 A ) . After this time , the correlation between cell age and amount of anillin in the nucleus is less marked , although there is a general trend for older cells to have more anillin . A small population of tissue culture cells has no detect - able anillin in their nuclei or cytoplasm . We think that these cells are paused in Go phase having dropped out of The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 131 , 1995 172 the cell cycle . In agreement with this idea , the percentage of these cells is higher for KC cells ( grown without serum ) than for Schneider cells ( data not shown ) . In more syn - chronously dividing population of cells , such as the follicle cells surrounding early stage egg chambers or the mitotic domains during gastrulation , neighboring nuclei exhibit very similar levels of anillin staining . A schematic sum - mary of the cell cycle dependent localization of anillin is presented in Fig . 5 B . Anillin Colocalizes with Myosin H in the Contractile Rings Responsible for Cell Division We have compared anillin localization with the localiza - tion of cytoplasmic myosin II ( using an antibody kindly donated by D . Kiehart ( Duke University Medical Center , Durham , NC ) ; Kiehart and Feghali , 1986 ) . During inter - phase of the syncytial blastoderm stages , anillin and myo - sin II colocalize on either side of the nucleus at the base of the somatic bud ( this stage corresponds to Fig . 3 A ) . Dur - ing prophase , when metaphase furrows begin to form , an - illin and myosin II colocalize at the invaginating mem - brane tip shown in cross - section ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) and in sagittal section ( Fig . 6 , C and D ) . Later at metaphase , anil - lin is still localized to the membrane tips , while myosin II staining has largely disappeared from the cortex ( Fig . 6 , E and F ) . As mitosis proceeds , the metaphase furrows re - tract , anillin remains at the tips although it is more diffuse ( not shown ) . During pole cell formation ( Fig . 6 , G and H ) , cellulariza - tion ( Fig . 6 , I and J ) , and cytokinesis ( Fig . 6 , K and L ) , an - illin and myosin II colocalize . Unlike anillin , myosin II does not enter the nucleus of dividing cells in the embryo . AniUin does not colocalize with myosin II in the apically constricting tips of cells at the leading edge during dorsal closure ( Fig . 7 ) . This cell shape change is thought to be caused by an actin / myosin II contraction ( Young et al . , Figure 7 . Confocal immunofluorescence imaging of anillin ( A ) and myosin II ( B ) localization during dorsal closure . Anillin does not colocalize with myosin II in the apically contricting cells at the leading edge during dorsal closure ( see arrowheads ) . Anillin is expressed and cycling from the nuclei to the cortex in the cells dividing to form the brain ( Br ) . Note that anillin is also present in small spots that we postulate are residues of completed contrac - tile rings . Bar , 30 jxM . 1993 ) . No anillin protein can be seen in these cells by im - munofluorescence . Anillin is seen in small spots scattered through out the late embryo . Myosin II does not colocalize with the majority of these spots . Anillin Localization in Ovarioles The location of anillin during oogenesis is compared to that of actin filaments and DNA in Fig . 8 . In early egg chambers , anillin is concentrated in the arrested cleavage furrows that link the oocyte to its 15 nurse cells ( Fig . 8 e ) . These intercellular connections later differentiate into the ring canals that allow bulk transport of materials from the nurse cells to the ooeyte . As the arrested furrows trans - form into ring canals , they gradually lose their anillin . The disappearance of anillin , which is almost complete at egg chamber stage 2 ( Fig . 8 e ) , coincides with the time that the ring canals acquire both their mature ultrastructure ( King et al . , 1982 ) and specialized actin binding proteins ( Robin - son et al . , 1994 ) . The follicle cells that surround the egg chambers in the ovarioles initially divide rapidly to maintain a continuous monolayer around an egg chamber of increasing size . In stage 6 egg chambers , this cell division ceases . The follicle cells become polyploid and continue to increase in size ( Spradling , 1993 ) . Anillin cycles from the nucleus to the cleavage furrow in the follicle cells surrounding egg cham - bers through stage 5 . However , the cessation of cell divi - sion ( in stage 6 and older egg chambers ) is accompanied by a dramatic loss of anillin staining in follicle cell nuclei ( Fig . 8 b ) . The polyploid nurse cell nuclei never accumu - late anillin in their nuclei , even though anillin protein is present in the nurse cell cytoplasm ( Fig . 8 b ) . Comparing data from ovarioles and late stage embryos we conclude that anillin localizes to nuclei only in dividing cells , and the presence of anillin in the nucleus appears to be a good marker for a cell ' s potential to divide . Anillin Binds to and Bundles Actin Filaments To determine whether anillin binds directly to actin fila - ments , we used protein A beads coated with anillin anti - body to immunoprecipitate the endogenous protein . Phal - loidin - stabilized actin filaments were added to these beads and then sedimented at low speed through a sucrose gradi - ent . Proteins sedimenting with the beads were analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Fig . 9 shows the results of such an experi - ment . Anillin sediments from embryo extract with both anti - anillin antibodies ( Fig . 9 , lanes I and 2 ) . Anillin does not sediment with random rabbit IgG ( lane 3 ) . Actin fila - ments added to the antibody loaded beads cosediment with the anillin bound beads ( lanes 4 and 5 ) but not with control beads bound with random rabbit IgG ( lane 6 ) . We used fragments of bacterially expressed anillin to map the actin binding domain of anillin . Initially , the en - tire predicted protein sequence was divided into five seg - ments by PCR methods and expressed as fusion proteins with a fourteen amino acid tag at their NH2 terminus . This tag includes six histidines that permit each fusion protein to be purified on immobilized nickel columns . Fig . 10 A shows the five 6xHis tagged fragments ( plus one GST fu - sion protein ) that were initially tested for actin binding . Purified fusion proteins were passed over both actin fila - Field and Alberts Anillin , a Contractile Ring Protein 173 Figure 8 . Conventional immu - nofluorescence analysis of an - illin localization in ovarioles . The Drosophila ovary is di - vided into discrete units called ovarioles ( a - c ) . At the anterior end of the ovariole is the ger - marium . ( Shown in brackets in a and enlarged in d - C ) . The germarium is connected to a series of egg chambers that mature as they move posteri - orly . The youngest egg cham - ber is termed stage 1 ( S1 ) . An egg chamber consists of three cell types ; an oocyte , nurse cells , and follicle cells . Each oocyte is interconnected to 15 nurse cells by structures called ring canals . The follicle cells surround the oocyte / nurse cell complex and divide as the egg chamber matures and in - creases in size . They continue to divide through egg chamber stage 5 ( $ 5 ) . During stage 6 ( $ 6 ) , the follicle cell nuclei stop dividing and become polyploid . Panels a and d are probed with FITC - phalloidin to visualize actin filaments . Panels b and e are probed with rhodamine - anti - anillin . Pan - els c and f are probed with the DNA dye , Hoechst # 33258 . Anillin enters the nuclei of fol - licle cells which are dividing ( through stage 5 ) , however in stage 6 when the cells stop di - viding , anillin no longer enters the nucleus . ( See panel b , com - pare white arrowheads [ $ 5 ] with black arrowheads [ $ 6 ] ) . The images in panels d and e show that anillin is present in the immature ring canals ( dou - ble black arrowheads in d ) . Anillin gradually disappears as actin intensity increases ( long white arrowheads ) . Note that anillin does not colocalize with the majority of filamentous ac - tin structures . ment columns and control albumin columns . The columns were then washed extensively and eluted with 0 . 5 M KC1 . The fragment that contained the amino terminal 371 amino acids of anillin bound quantitatively to actin fila - ment columns , while passing through the control column . None of the other fragments bound to either column ( not shown ) . The actin binding portion of anillin was further defined by preparing shorter fusion proteins shown in Fig . 10 B . To test for actin binding , the fusion proteins in Fig . 10 B were incubated with phalloidin - stabilized actin filaments and sedimented through a 40 % glycerol cushion . The su - pernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Fig . 11 displays the results of such a sedimentation experiment . The first two panels show the data for anillin fragments that cosediment with actin filaments and the third and fourth panels for anillin fragments that do not co - sedi - ment . The chart in Fig . 10 B summarizes the results of these binding studies . All fragments that bind have an 82 - amino acid fragment in common . This fragment on its own is also capable of binding actin filaments . We have tested the salt sensitivity of the actin - binding for several of the protein fragments in Fig . 10 B . Sedimen - tation experiments show that the binding is decreased in The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 131 , 1995 174 Figure 9 . Coomassie stained gel analysis of endogenous anillin binding directly to ac - tin filaments . Lanes 1 and 2 show that anillin labeled ( Anil ) from embryo extracts binds to protein A beads coated with two different anti - anillin antibodies ( anti - 6xHis - anillin 1 - 371 ( lane 1 ) and anti - GST - anillin 401 - 828 ( lane 2 ) .

However , even at 400 mM KC1 , some of the protein still sediments with the actin filaments ( not shown ) . To test the actin - binding fragments for their effect on actin filaments , purified fusion proteins were mixed with Figure 10 .

A pro - nounced bundling of the actin filaments was observed with several of the protein fragments in the presence of 50 mM KC1 as shown in Fig . 12 . When the KC1 concentration was raised to 100 mM , bundling disappeared for some frag - ments , and only the bundling by fragments 1 - 371 and 127 - 371 was unaffected . The actin filament bundling activities observed are summarized in the chart in Fig . 10 B . This bundling of actin filaments requires that an anillin fragment contain two or more actin binding sites . Alterna - tively , the protein could act as a dimer or multimer with a single site per monomer ( Matudaira , 1991 ) . To distinguish between these two possibilities , fusion protein 127 - 371 , the smallest of the fragments that binds and bundles stably in the presence of 100 mM KC1 was analyzed by sedimenta - tion equilibrium in an analytical ultracentrifuge . The mo - lecular weight of the native anillin fragment was estimated at 30 . 5 , 29 . 5 , and 31 kD in three different runs at two dif - ferent protein concentrations . These values are similar to the predicted monomer size of 28 . 1 kD . The centrifugation was performed at higher protein concentrations ( 20 - 30 p ~ m ) than the bundling assay ( 3 p ~ m ) , so it is unlikely that the protein was dimerized under the conditions of the as - say . We conclude that this protein fragment bundles as a monomer , consistent with the idea that the 127 - 371 frag - ment contains two separate actin binding sites . However , we cannot exclude the possibility that anillin may dimerize only after binding to actin filaments . Discussion One approach to understanding the mechanism and regu - lation of cytokinesis is to identify proteins that comprise the cleavage furrow , and to study their functions and inter - actions individually . Actin - filament affinity chromatogra - phy combined with immunocytochemistry has proven suc - cessful in identifying novel actin binding proteins .

For details see Materials and Methods , Bundling is seen in only c and d , The chart in Fig . 10 B summarizes the results of these experiments . focusing on proteins enriched in the invaginating furrow tips during early embryonic contractile events , we have identified a novel protein , anillin , that is also enriched in the cleavage furrows of all dividing Drosophila cells . We have identified three other furrow enriched actin binding proteins using this strategy ( Field , C . , unpublished re - sults ) . Two of them are previously identified actin binding proteins , myosin II , which is known to be central to the cleavage mechanism ( Satterwhite and Pollard , 1992 ) , and the Drosophila homologue of ABP 280 which has been implicated in the maintenance of cortical integrity ( Cun - ningham et al . , 1992 ; Gorlin et al . , 1990 ) . The third protein appears to be novel . AniUin Sequence The predicted amino acid sequence of anillin provides lit - tle information regarding the function of the protein . It contains a proline - rich region , as do several other actin binding and cytoskeletal proteins : c - abl ( Van Etten et al . , 1994 ) , radixin ( Funayama et al . , 1991 ) , ABP 1 ( Drubin et al . , 1990 ) , and Z - 01 ( Bement et al . , 1993 ) . Included within the proline rich region of anillin are two consensus se - quences for an SH3 binding domain ( Fig . 1 , dotted under - line ) ( Yu et al . , 1994 ; Lim , et al . , 1994 ) . SH3 domains are contained in other cytoskeletal and membrane - associated proteins , including myosin I ( Drubin et al . , 1990 ) and are thought to mediate protein - protein interactions ( Ren et al . , 1993 ) . Anillin also contains at least three possible nu - clear localization sequences ( Fig . 1 , boxed ) . We have not yet tested whether these sequences are responsible for the nuclear localization of anillin . The region of anillin that binds and bundles actin filaments in our in vitro studies ( amino acids 127 - 371 ) has no obvious homology with other known actin binding domains . AniUin Localization in Contractile Domains It may be useful to think of the actin cytoskeleton in the early Drosophila embryo as organized into two types of domains , contractile domains that are rich in myosin II , and noncontractile domains that consist of the majority of the cortical actin filaments in the cell . Anillin is associated preferentially with actin filaments in contractile domains such as the contractile ring formed during cellularization or cytokinesis . While it has been generally accepted that cellularization is a specialized form of cytokinesis , the mechanism respon - sible for the contractile events occuring in the syncytial embryo have been less clear . Our anillin / myosin If colocal - ization data is consistent with a common mechanism for all the contractile events associated with the isolation of two parts of the cytoplasm from one another . We term such events " cell division associated contractivity . " In Dro - sophila , these events include ; pole bud formation , somatic budding , metaphase furrow formation , cellularization , and cytokinesis . Interestingly , anillin is absent from the api - cally contracting tips of cells at the leading edge during dorsal closure , though myosin II is highly enriched in these contractile structures . This implies mechanistic differences in the regulation of cell division associated contractile events and contractile events associated with cell shape changes in interphase . Implicit in our observations in the syncytial embryo is a revised view of when the contraction occurs during recta - phase furrow formation . We propose that the active con - tractile event during nuclear cycles 10 - 13 occurs during in - terphase and prophase , when anillin and myosin II are both greatly enriched on either side of the nucleus . We postulate that an actin / myosin based contraction creates the somatic buds seen during interphase and later the metaphase furrows , which are actually formed during pro - phase . The absence of myosin II from the tips of the fur - rows during metaphase suggests that once the contraction is complete , myosin is no longer required and disappears from the cortex . Anillin persists in the metaphase furrow through mitosis , and remains associated as the cortex re - laxes during telophase . The strong enrichment of anillin in cell division associ - ated contractile domains of the actin cytoskeleton suggests that it plays a role in their organization or function . Our in vitro data indicates that anillin can bundle actin filaments . Thus one potential role for anillin is to mechanically stabi - lize actin filaments during contraction . Another bundling protein , ~ x - actinin , localizes to contractile rings , but its en - richment in these structures is variable ( Satterwhite and Pollard , 1992 ) . In all the cell division associated contractile events we have studied ( nascent ring canals , metaphase furrows , and cytokinesis ) anillin persists at the region of membrane fur - rowing after contraction has finished and myosin II has re - leased from the cortex . Thus anillin may play a role in stabi - lizing the membrane invagination after myosin II - mediated force production ceases by bundling cortical actin . In situ - ations where cyokinesis occurs to completion ( i . e . , the in - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 131 , 1995 176 vaginating membranes fuse ) anitlin may play a rote in the completion step . Little is known about the mechanisms of this step , in which the septin proteins have also been sug - gested to play a role ( Sanders and Field , 1994 ) . In situa - tions where cytokinesis is incomplete , such as ring canals , anillin may serve to cross - link the actin filaments support - ing the invaginated cortex until more permanent cross - linking proteins such as kelch ( Robinson et al . , 1994 ) are recruited . Anillin Localization in the Nucleus In later embryonic and tissue culture cells , anillin resides in the nucleus during the majority of the cell cycle , sepa - rated from the actin cytoskeleton ( see Fig . 3 E and Fig . 4 , D - F ) . The mechanism of nuclear enrichment of anillin is unknown , although its sequence contains three potential nuclear localization sequences ( NLSs ) . A NLS that is ac - tive during interphase and dominant over other localiza - tion signals , combined with one or more actin binding sites that are active during mitosis , could account for the cycling of aniiiin between nucleus and cortex . We speculate that the nuclear localization of anillin serves to prevent the protein ' s interaction with cortical ac - tin . Release of anillin from the nucleus during mitosis could play a role in organizing the cortex for its specialized function in cleavage . Anillin could thus play a role in coor - dinating the cytoskeletal changes that occur during cell di - vision with respect to the cell cycle . Consistent with this idea , anillin is only expressed in cells with the potential to divide with the exception of nurse cells , where is is pre - sumably stock - piled for later use in embryogenesis . An al - ternative view would be that anillin plays an active role in the nucleus , a possibility that might be most readily tested by genetic analysis . In the precellularization embryo , anillin never enters nuclei although other nuclear proteins such as histories ( Minden et al . , 1989 ) and topoisomerase II ( Swedlow et al . , 1993 ) are efficiently imported during this stage . The tim - ing of cell division associated contractivity is different in syncytial blastoderm embryos compared to somatic cells , where cytokinesis occurs in anaphase . Cytoplasmic buds protrude in interphase and metaphase furrows begin to form in prophase . The membrane invaginations that occur during cellularization also form during interphase ( Foe and Alberts , 1983 ; Karr and Alberts , 1986 ) . Nuclear up - take of anillin may be inactivated in precellularization em - bryos to allow anillin to interact with the interphase cortex , or cortical binding may be dominant over nuclear uptake . The change to the more typical regulation with nuclear up - take in interphase may require zygotic transcription . How anillin becomes localized to a subset of the cell ' s actin filaments in contractile domains is not known . The same question can be asked for myosin , peanut , radixin , and other actin binding proteins that localize to contractile rings . Binding specificity of anillin could be conferred by local regulation of actin - binding activity , for example by phosphorylation . Alternatively , selective localization may arise from direct interaction between anillin and other fur - row proteins , such as myosin II or peanut . The actin bind - ing domain of anillin accounts for only a small part of the protein ( ~ 20 % ) . Other domains of the molecule are likely to be important for both its function and its localization , Preliminary biochemical experiments have not detected high affinity interactions between anillin and myosin or other proteins . However affinity chromatography on im - mobilized anillin has identified several interacting proteins ( unpublished results of Field , C . ) . Their identification and characterization may help us to better understand how furrows function and are formed , We thank Tim Mitchison , Karen Oegema , and Jordan Raft for technical advice and stimulating discussions and Kathy Miller for suggesting the combination of immunoprecipitation and actin cosedimentation to show that endogenous anillin does bind actin filaments .
