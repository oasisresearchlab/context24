We use a hierarchically coded data set of 21 NPIs and propose a novel modelling approach that combines four computational techniques , 22 which together allow for a worldwide consensus rank of the NPIs based on their effectiveness 23 in mitigating the spread of COVID - 19 . We show how the effectiveness of individual NPIs 24 strongly varies across countries and world regions , and in relation to human and economic 25 development as well as different dimensions of governance . We quantify the effectiveness of 26 each NPI with respect to the epidemic age of its adoption , i . e . , how early into the epidemics . 27 The emerging picture is one in which no one - ﬁts - all solution exists , and no single NPI alone 28 can decrease R t below one and that a combination of NPIs is necessary to curb the spread of 29 the virus . We show that there are NPIs considerably less intrusive and costly than lockdowns 30 that are also highly effective , such as certain risk communication strategies and voluntary 31 measures that strengthen the healthcare system . By allowing to simulate “what - if” scenarios 32 at the country level , our approach opens the way for planning the most likely effectiveness of 33 future NPIs . 34 2 .

Decisions had to be taken under rapidly changing 40 epidemiological situations , despite a dramatic lack of scientiﬁc evidence on the individual and 41 combined effectiveness of these measures 2 , 3 , degree of compliance of the population , and societal 42 impact . 43 This strategy can be compared with hitting the infection curve with a blunt sledgehammer , 44 hoping that some of the interventions might suppress transmission to a degree that drives the 45 effective reproduction number , R t ( the average number of new infections caused by one infected 46 individual ) , below one . The lack of data - driven evidence in support for the implemented NPIs may 47 be best exempliﬁed by the conﬂicting recommendations on the use of face masks . Both , the World 48 Health Organization ( WHO ) and the German Robert Koch Institute ( RKI ) reversed their initial 49 recommendations against masks after new evidence appeared , suggesting that optimum use of face 50 masks is associated with a large reduction in risk of COVID - 19 infection 4 . 51 Government interventions may cause signiﬁcant societal and economic damages and may 52 affect individuals’ behaviour , mental health and social security 5 .

As many countries rolled out several NPIs simultaneously , the challenge of disentangling 56 the impact of each individual intervention arises . 57 To date , studies of the country - speciﬁc progression of the COVID - 19 pandemic 6 have mostly 58 explored the independent effects of a single category of interventions . These categories include 59 travel restrictions 2 , 7 , social distancing 8 – 14 , or personal protective measures 11 . Some studies focused 60 on a single country or even a town 14 – 18 . Some research has combined data from multiple countries 61 but has pooled NPIs into rather broad categories 10 , 19 , which eventually limits the assessment of 62 speciﬁc , potentially critical NPIs , that may be less costly and more effective than others . 63 Using a comprehensive , hierarchically coded , data set of 4 , 579 NPIs implemented in 76 64 territories 20 , here we analyse the impact of government interventions on R t , using harmonised 65 results from a new multi - method approach consisting of ( i ) a case - control analysis ( CC ) , ( ii ) a step 66 function approach to LASSO time - series regression ( LASSO ) , ( iii ) random forests ( RF ) and ( iv ) 67 recurrent neural networks ( RNN ) . We also investigate country - based control strategies as well as 68 the impact of some selected country - speciﬁc metrics . We ﬁnally focus on the highly controversial 69 nation - wide ( or state - wide ) lockdowns and investigate the relevance of this measure with respect to 70 the timeliness of its implementation . 71 All approaches ( i - iv ) yield comparable rankings of the effectiveness of different categories of 72 NPIs across their hierarchical levels . This remarkable agreement allows us to identify a consensus 73 4 .

Further , we evaluate the heterogeneity 74 of the effectiveness of individual NPIs in different territories . We ﬁnd that time of implementation , 75 already implemented measures , different dimensions of governance , as well as human and social 76 development affect the effectiveness of NPIs to varying degrees . 77 2 Results 78 Global approach . Our results are based on a consolidated version of the CCCSL ( CSH COVID19 79 Control Strategies List ) 20 . This data set provides a hierarchical taxonomy of NPIs on four levels : 80 eight broad themes ( level 1 , L1 ) are divided into 53 categories of individual NPIs ( level 2 , L2 ) that 81 include hundreds of subcategories ( level 3 , L3 ) and additional group codes ( level 4 , L4 ) . In Figure 1 82 we compare the results for the NPIs’ effectiveness rankings for the four methods of our approach 83 ( i - iv ) on L1 ( themes ) ; see Methods for how these ranks were obtained . A clear picture emerges : 84 the themes of social distancing , healthcare & public health capacity , travel restrictions , and risk 85 communication score as the top four intervention types in all methods . Social distancing is the 86 highest ranked theme of NPIs in all but one method . 87 We next compare results obtained on L2 of the NPI data set , i . e . , using the 53 individual NPI 88 categories . A substantial number of interventions has a signiﬁcant effect on R t for the majority 89 of the methods , see Figure 2 and Table 1 . Seven NPI categories show signiﬁcant impacts on R t 90 in all four methods ( given the number of signiﬁcant results in each method , we would expect an 91 overlap of 1 . 65 under completely unrelated results ) while three out of four methods identify the 92 5 .

All methods indicate that NPIs belonging to the themes of social distancing , healthcare & public health capacity , risk communication , and travel restrictions lead to the most signiﬁcant reductions of R t ( these themes are ranked within the top four themes in all approaches ) . 6 .

The pairwise Pearson correlations between the methods 93 range between 0 . 3 and 0 . 7 , with p - values between p = 0 . 029 and p < 10   8 . Similar results hold for 94 Spearman’s correlation . In Table S2 we list the subcategories ( L3 ) belonging to the seven consensus 95 categories . 96 A normalised score for each NPI category is obtained by rescaling the result of each method 97 to range between zero ( least effective ) and one ( most effective ) and then averaging this score . The 98 maximal ( minimal ) NPI score is therefore 100 % ( 0 % ) , meaning that the measure is the most ( least ) 99 effective measure in each method . Amongst the seven consensual NPI categories , the largest impacts 100 on R t are displayed by the closure of educational institutions ( with a score of 85 % and estimates for 101   R t ranging from   0 . 064 to   0 . 34 ) , small gathering cancellations ( 72 % ,   R t between   0 . 082 102 and - 0 . 23 ) and border restrictions ( 57 % ,   R t between   0 . 024 and - 0 . 24 ) . We ﬁnd seven other 103 NPI categories consensually in three of our methods . These include risk communication activities 104 to inform and educate the public ( 65 % ,   R t between   0 . 066 and - 0 . 31 ) and mass gathering 105 cancellations ( 51 % ,   R t between   0 . 032 and - 0 . 27 ) . 106 In Figure 3 we visualise the ﬁndings on the NPIs’ effectiveness in a co - implementation 107 network 20 . Nodes correspond to categories ( L2 ) with a size being proportional to their normalised 108 score . Directed links from i to j indicate a tendency that countries implement NPI j after they 109 implemented i . The network therefore illustrates the typical NPI implementation sequence of the 53 110 countries and the steps within this sequence that contribute most to a reduction of R t . For instance , 111 there is a pattern where countries ﬁrst cancel mass gatherings before moving on to cancellations 112 7 .

Education and active communication is a powerfully effective early measure 114 ( implemented around 15 days before 30 cases were reported ) . Most social distancing and travel 115 restriction measures ( i . e . , closure of educational institutions , work safety protocols , cordon sanitaire , 116 individual movement restrictions , complete lockdown ) are typically implemented within the ﬁrst 117 two weeks after reaching 30 cases with varying impacts ; see also Figure 2 . 118 By analysing the third and fourth levels of the coding hierarchy , the CC approach makes 119 it possible to assess the effectiveness of NPIs related to the use of face masks . Increasing the 120 availability of face masks for healthcare professionals shows a signiﬁcant impact on the R t (   R t = 121   0 . 07 ( 1 ) ) . There is also a considerable effect of communicating with the public and promoting 122 the use of face masks (   R t =   0 . 19 ( 2 ) ) . However , their mandatory use in public settings shows a 123 weaker effect (   R t =   0 . 13 ( 3 ) ) . These three mask - related NPIs have typically been implemented 124 at different times of the epidemic . Promoting the use of face masks started on average three days 125 after 30 cases were counted in a country , measures to increase their availability in healthcare settings 126 were implemented 11 days afterwards , and the mandatory use of face masks in public environments 127 came 22 days later . 128 Country - level approach . A sensitivity check of our results with respect to the removal of individ - 129 ual continents from the analysis also indicates substantial variations between different regions of 130 the world in terms of NPI effectiveness , see SI . To further quantify how much the effectiveness of 131 an NPI depends on the particular territory ( country or US state ) where it has been introduced , we 132 11 .

Fig . 4 shows the normalised entropy of each NPI category versus 134 its rank . A value of entropy close to zero implies that the corresponding NPI has a similar rank 135 relative to all other NPIs in all territories . In other words , the effectiveness of the NPI does not 136 depend on the speciﬁc country or state . On the contrary , a high value of the normalised entropy 137 signals that the same NPI performs very differently in different regions . 138 The values of the normalised entropies for many NPIs are far from being one and below 139 the corresponding values obtained through a temporal reshufﬂing of the NPIs in each country . 140 The effectiveness of many NPIs therefore is , ﬁrst , signiﬁcant and , second , heavily dependent on 141 the local context , which is a combination of socio - economic features and NPIs already adopted . 142 We further explore this interplay of NPIs with socio - economic factors by analysing the effects 143 of demographic and socio - economic covariates , as well as indicators for governance , human and 144 economic development in the CC method , see Supplementary Information ( SI ) . We ﬁnd a robust 145 tendency that NPIs are less effective in countries with high levels of human development ( as 146 quantiﬁed by the Human Development Index ) , governance - related accountability and political 147 stability ( as quantiﬁed by World Governance Indicators provided by the World Bank ) . 148 We then focus on the whether the efﬁcacy of speciﬁc NPI depends on its epidemic age , i . e . , 149 how early it was adopted in each speciﬁc country . Without loss of generality , here we focus on the 150 NPI of a National lockdown ( or State lockdown in the US ) and we refer to the SI for the complete 151 treatment of all the other NPIs . As it is known , the complete lockdown triggered a lot of debates 152 12 .

To avoid biases connected to the epidemic age , we compute the ranking from the relative variation of R t , i . e . ,   R t / R t . about its efﬁcacy and its real necessity , also considering its level of invasiveness . In the RNN 153 approach , we assess the relative effectiveness of the lockdown measure in different countries . Here 154 relative effectiveness means the relative position in the ranking of a speciﬁc country , i . e . , the ranking 155 position normalised with the number of NPIs adopted in that country . To this end we repeat the 156 same knockout procedure adopted above to extract the NPI rankings in the framework of the RNN 157 method ( see SI ) for each country separately and compute , for each country , the normalised ranking 158 position of National lockdown ( or State lockdown in the US ) . Fig . 5 reports the normalised rank in 159 each country / state as a function of the epidemic age of National lockdown ( left ) or State lockdown 160 ( right ) in that country / state . 161 There is a strong correlation between the effectiveness of the national / state lockdown and the 162 epidemic age of its implementation . We can conclude that the epidemic age is highly relevant when 163 14 .

A short synthesis for that is " the earlier , the better " . We 164 refer to the Supplementary Information for the report of this analysis applied to all NPIs . 165 3 Discussion 166 To give a better synthesis , in the following , we discuss our main ﬁndings organised according to the 167 themes at the top level of NPIs hierarchy . 168 Social distancing . Bans of small gatherings ( gatherings of 50 persons or less ) and the closure of 169 educational institutions have a more substantial effect on R t ( but are also more intrusive to our daily 170 lives ) than the prohibition of mass gatherings , measures targeting special populations ( e . g . , elderly , 171 vulnerable populations , hospitalized patients , prisoners or more exposed non - healthcare profes - 172 sionals ) or adaptive measures for certain establishments ( e . g . , places of worship , administrative 173 institutions , entertainment venues , nursing homes ) . In two recent studies based on smaller numbers 174 of countries , school closures had been attributed only a little effect on the spread of COVID - 19 9 , 10 . 175 Social distancing measures are less effective in countries with a high population density and a 176 high degree of citizen participation in the government , as well as freedom of expression or free 177 media ( WGI Voice & Accountability ) . The country - level analysis conﬁrms that these NPIs have 178 a particularly high entropy , meaning that their effectiveness varies indeed substantially across 179 countries . An exception to that are the measures for public transport and work safety protocols , 180 where the latter mostly refers to mandatory guidelines for , e . g . , physical barriers or fever checks at 181 workplaces . These two social distancing measures have a low effectiveness rank ( little signiﬁcance 182 15 .

An increase in the availability of personal protective 185 equipment ( PPE ) to the healthcare workforce , together with measures aiming to reduce the num - 186 ber of non - COVID - 19 or non - critical COVID - 19 patients in medical centres and hospitals ( by 187 promoting self - isolation of mildly symptomatic patients , setting up health hotlines , etc . ) are also 188 essential building blocks of successful containment strategies . All of these measures combine high 189 effectiveness of early implementation and low entropy , meaning that they are similarly effective in 190 most countries . Consequently , they also show less or no consistent correlations with most of the 191 country - level development or governance indicators . There is one notable exception to this general 192 trend , namely the increased availability of PPE , which positively and strongly correlates with the 193 control of corruption . Indeed , there are increased news reports currently on scandals related to 194 government procurement of PPE 21 – 23 . 195 Travel restrictions . Different types of travel restrictions also show signiﬁcant effects , in particular 196 border restrictions ( e . g . , border closure , border controls ) , individual movement restrictions ( e . g . , 197 curfews , the prohibition of non - essential activities ) and cordons sanitaires ( containment zones ) . 198 The high effectiveness of border restrictions is driven by European countries ( its impact on R t 199 turns insigniﬁcant in two of our methods after removing all European countries ) ; most likely for 200 geographic reasons . This ﬁnding is in line with a high entropy score of border , airport , port and ship 201 as well as individual movement restrictions . 202 16 .

Recent studies suggest that a national lockdown reduces R t by an average of 5 % 9 to 204 80 % 10 , whereas other interventions seem to reduce the virus spread by 5 % 10 to 30 % 9 .

Our analysis highlights the 207 importance of early national lockdowns by showing how the relative effectiveness of that measure 208 correlates with the epidemic age of its adoption . However , the reduced effectiveness of lockdowns 209 at higher epidemic age , as observed in Fig . 5 , does not necessarily imply that taking this NPI late is 210 useless . 211 Risk communication . In terms of risk communication , we ﬁnd that pro - active communication with 212 stakeholders from the private sector ( e . g . , business owners or chief executive ofﬁcers ) to promote 213 voluntary safety protocols in enterprises , businesses , event organization , government administrations , 214 etc . , shows a signiﬁcant effect in each of the four analyses , mainly when implemented early . Three 215 out of four approaches also indicate a substantial impact of public health communication strategies 216 ( i . e . , non - binding NPIs ) encouraging citizen engagement and empowering them with information . 217 The voluntary promotion of the use of face masks is also an efﬁcient risk communication strategy . 218 To better understand this , we performed an in - depth assessment of the impact of NPIs related 219 to face masks . Masks are captured in total in three different interventions : the ﬁrst one aims 220 to increase their availability to health workers ( increase the availability of PPE ) , which not only 221 shows a protective effect for the personnel but also contributes to curbing the spread of the disease 222 by diminishing the role of hospitals as sources of infection ,   R t =   0 . 07 ( 1 ) . The two other 223 17 . CC - BY 4 . 0 International license It is made available under a is the author / funder , who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity .

Some governments have 224 actively promoted the wearing of masks through information campaigns on respiratory etiquette . 225 This measure was typically implemented early in the epidemic ( on average , three days after reaching 226 30 cases ) . Other countries have enacted the use of masks as mandatory , generally at later stages 227 of the epidemic ( 22 days after 30 cases ) , often accompanied by information campaigns ( and 228 sometimes enforced by police sanctions ) . The early promotion of the use of face masks shows a 229 signiﬁcant effect (   R t =   0 . 19 ( 2 ) ) , whereas late mandatory use appears to have an attenuated 230 impact (   R t =   0 . 13 ( 3 ) ) . This picture suggests that face masks are useful 4 , 25 in particular when 231 they are immediately available ( as stocks for example ) for health workers and the public , making it 232 possible to promote their general use . Many European countries ﬁrst had to procure masks before 233 establishing their usage mandatory to enforce compliance 26 . This circumstance might have reduced 234 their effectiveness . 235 Resource allocation . Measures for resource allocation show limited impacts on R t in our analysis 236 ( e . g . , police and army interventions being insigniﬁcant in all studies ) with relatively high entropy , 237 meaning that country - level effects are important . Surprisingly , the implementation of crisis manage - 238 ment plans turns out to be highly effective , except for the Americas . After removing countries from 239 North and South America from the analyses , all four of our methods agree on signiﬁcant effects of 240 crisis management plans with an   R t of down to   0 . 3 , suggesting a lack of effective crisis plans 241 in American territories . For instance , US states had to focus on providing health insurance and 242 economic stimulus as well as facilitating administrative procedures , while European countries could 243 develop their plans on top of a stronger socio - economic basis 27 , 28 . Crisis management plans are 244 18 .

NPIs related to case identiﬁcation 248 and contact tracing show some of the lowest effectiveness ranks and in some cases even increase R t , 249 consistently across most countries ( NPIs with the ﬁve lowest entropy scores all belong to this theme ) . 250 This result is to be expected , as , e . g . , increased testing and faster contact tracing will on the short - run 251 increase the numbers of found cases in return for reduced numbers in the long run . We do not assess 252 such long - term effects ( over timespans of more than a month ) in the current work . Furthermore , 253 note that our analysis considers mostly data from March and April 2020 where many countries 254 experienced surges of case numbers that most likely hindered effective contact tracing and other 255 case identiﬁcation measures . This also applies to the relative ineffectiveness of quarantining people 256 who either are infected or were exposed to infected persons , while the promotion of self - isolation of 257 people with symptoms belonged to one of the most effective NPI . This result conﬁrms a tendency 258 in our results where voluntary measures are more effective than similar mandatory ones . 259 Strengths & Limitations . The assessment of the effectiveness of NPIs is statistically challenging , 260 as measures were typically implemented simultaneously and because their impact might well depend 261 on the particular implementation sequence . Our four methodological approaches are susceptible to 262 resulting biases in different ways . While some methods might be prone to overestimating effects 263 from an NPI due to insufﬁcient adjustments for confounding effects from other measures , other 264 19 .

As a consequence , estimates of   R t might vary substantially across different methods , whereas 266 the agreement on the signiﬁcance of individual NPIs is much more pronounced . The strength of our 267 study , therefore , lies in the harmonization of these four independent methodological approaches , 268 combined with the usage of an extensive data set on NPIs . This study design substantially reduces 269 the risk of idiosyncratic results due to model biases . Moreover , whereas previous studies often 270 subsumed a wide range of social distancing and travel restriction measures under a single entity , our 271 analysis contributes to a more ﬁne - grained understanding of each NPI . 272 It is also essential to highlight the limitations of our approach . The CCCSL data set features 273 non - homogeneous data quality and completeness across the different territories and data collection 274 could be biased by the data collector ( native versus non - native ) as well as the information communi - 275 cated by governments . Moreover , the coding system presents some drawbacks , notably because 276 some interventions could belong to more than one category but are only recorded once . Compliance 277 with NPIs is crucial for their effectiveness , yet we assumed a comparable degree of compliance by 278 each population . Additionally , we neither took into account the stringency of NPI implementation 279 nor potential variations of NPI effectiveness over time , except for the dependency on the epidemic 280 age of its adoption . 281 To compute R t , we used time - series of the number of conﬁrmed COVID - 19 cases 30 . This 282 approach may over - represent patients with severe symptoms and may be biased by variations in 283 testing and reporting policies among countries . We assumed a constant serial interval ( average 284 20 .

However , this number shows considerable 285 variations in the literature 31 and depends on measures such as social distancing and self - isolation . 286 Our analysis provides a large - scale quantiﬁcation of the effectiveness of different NPIs in 287 mitigating the transmission of COVID - 19 . The consensus displayed by the four different methods 288 guarantees the robustness of the results . 289 4 Conclusions 290 Here we presented the outcome of an extensive analysis on the impact of 4 , 579 individual NPIs 291 ( N = 53 ) on the effective reproduction number R t of COVID - 19 in 76 territories worldwide . The 292 adoption of the CCCSL data set 20 of NPIs , makes of our study the largest on NPI effectiveness to 293 date 10 , 19 , 32 , 33 . 294 Our study dissects the entangled packages of NPIs 20 and gives new insights into their effectiveness . 295 Our ﬁndings suggest that there is no silver bullet to efﬁciently reduce the burden of a potential 296 second COVID - 19 wave or any similar future viral respiratory epidemics through NPIs . Instead , we 297 identify several decisive interventions that signiﬁcantly contribute to reducing R t below one , though 298 none of these interventions alone would be enough to stop the epidemic . At the global level , our 299 results reveal a worldwide consensus rank of the NPIs based on their effectiveness in mitigating the 300 spread of COVID - 19 . For instance , i ) social distancing , ii ) travel restrictions , and iii ) healthcare and 301 public health capacity ( e . g . , reduce the burden on the healthcare system by encouraging self - initiated 302 isolation of people symptoms ) have a particularly strong effect on the reduction of R t .

( which was not certified by peer review ) The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted July 8 , 2020 . . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 2020 . 07 . 06 . 20147199 doi : medRxiv preprint is in line with results from other studies which used different statistical approaches , epidemiological 304 metrics , geographic coverage , and classiﬁcations of NPIs 2 , 7 – 13 . More importantly , the possibility 305 to focus the analysis on individual countries , reveals that the efﬁcacy of individual NPIs strongly 306 varies across countries and world regions , and in relation to human and economic development as 307 well as different dimensions of governance . This ﬁnding is signiﬁcant because it implies that the 308 impact of speciﬁc NPIs in a particular area is the complex outcome of the non - trivial combination 309 of socio - economic features and the NPIs already adopted . The dependency on the local context 310 is not surprising , and it points to a high heterogeneity across countries and a non - independence 311 among the different NPIs . Another source of complexity is represented by the dependency on the 312 effectiveness of each NPIs on the epidemic age of its adoption . In simple words , the same NPI in 313 the same country can have a drastically different impact if taken early or later on . 314 The emerging picture is one in which no one - ﬁts - all solution exists , and no single NPI alone 315 can decrease R t below one . Instead , in the absence of a vaccine , a resurgence of COVID - 19 cases 316 can only be stopped by a suitable combination of NPIs , each tailored to the speciﬁc country and 317 its epidemic age . These measures must be enacted together — and with the best timing — to be 318 maximally effective on the spread of COVID - 19 and enable a faster re - opening . 319 One of the consequences of this picture is that NPIs considerably less intrusive and less 320 costly than lockdowns could be highly effective , such as speciﬁc risk communication strategies 321 and voluntary measures that strengthen the healthcare system . In fact , we found several instances 322 where non - binding governmental guidelines strongly outperformed their mandatory counterparts 323 22 .

These results call for a strong effort to simulate " what - if " 324 scenarios at the country level for planning the most likely effectiveness of future NPIs , and , thanks 325 to the possibility to go down to the level of single countries and speciﬁc local contexts , our approach 326 is the ﬁrst contribution to this end . 327 References 328 329 1 .

Each L1 ( theme ) is composed of several categories ( L2 of the coding scheme ) , 434 that contain subcategories ( L3 ) which are further subdivided to group codes ( L4 ) . The data set 435 covers 52 countries ; data for the USA is available at the state level ( 24 states ) . This makes a total of 436 76 territories . The time window for which data is available varies by territory . In this analysis , we 437 use a static version of the CCCSL , retrieved on 15 May 2020 , presenting 4 , 579 NPIs . A glossary 438 of the codes is provided on github . For each country , we use the data until the day to which the 439 measures have been reliably updated . NPIs that have been implemented in less than ﬁve territories 440 are not considered , leading to a ﬁnal number of 3 , 850 NPIs of 53 different L2 categories to be used 441 in the analyses . 442 COVID - 19 case data . To estimate the effective reproduction number R t , and growth rates 443 of the number of COVID - 19 cases , we use time series of the number of conﬁrmed COVID - 19 cases 444 in the 76 considered territories 30 . To control for weekly ﬂuctuations , we smooth the time series 445 by computing the rolling average using a Gaussian window with a standard deviation of two days , 446 truncated at a maximum window size of 15 days . 447 Regression techniques . We apply four different statistical approaches to quantify the impact of a 448 NPI M on the reduction of R t ( see details in the Supplementary Information ) . 449 29 .

The case - control analysis ( CC ) considers each single category ( L2 ) 450 or subcategory ( L3 ) M separately and compares the difference   R t in the R t between all countries 451 that implemented M ( cases ) with those that did not implement it ( controls ) during the observation 452 window . The comparison is made via a linear regression model adjusting for ( i ) epidemic age ( days 453 after the country has reached 30 conﬁrmed cases ) , ( ii ) the value of R t before M takes effect , ( iii ) 454 total population , ( iv ) population density , ( v ) the total number of NPIs implemented and ( vi ) number 455 of NPIs implemented in the same category as M . With this design , we investigate the time delay of 456 ⌧ days between implementing M and observing   R t , as well as additional country - based covariates 457 that quantify other dimensions of governance and human and economic development . Estimates for 458 R t are averaged over delays between 1 and 28 days . 459 Step function Lasso regression . In this approach , we assume that without any intervention , 460 the reproduction factor is constant and deviations from this constant are caused by a time - delayed 461 onset of each NPI on L2 ( categories ) of the hierarchical data set . We use a Lasso regularization 462 approach combined with a meta parameter search to select a reduced set of NPIs that best describe 463 the observed   R t . Estimates for the changes of   R t attributable to NPI M are obtained from 464 country - wise cross - validation . 465 Random forest regression . We perform a random forest ( RF ) regression , where the NPIs 466 implemented in a country are used as predictors for R t , time - shifted ⌧ days into the future . Here , ⌧ 467 accounts for the time delay between implementation and onset of the effect of a given NPI . Similar 468 30 .

But 470 contrary to the two methods described above , the random forest represents a nonlinear model , 471 meaning that the effects of individual NPIs on R t do not need to add up linearly . The importance of 472 a NPI is deﬁned as the decline in the predictive performance of the random forest on unseen data if 473 the data concerning that NPI is replaced by noise , also called permutation importance . 474 Recurrent Neural Networks Modeling . Recurrent neural networks ( RNN ) built using 475 Long Short - Term Memory ( LSTM ) cells 34 have proven to be suitable models for dynamic processes 476 such as epidemic propagation due to their ability to recall past events . Here we use a RNN with 477 identical input as described for the random forest regression , along with the values of R t . The 478 best performing network ( least mean square error in country - wise cross - validation ) is identiﬁed 479 as having two hidden layers of 100 neurons , one output described by a linear output layer , and 54 480 inputs ( corresponding to each category and R t ) . To quantify the impact of a measure M on R t , we 481 use the trained RNN as a predictive model and compare simulations without any measure ( reference ) 482 to simulations where one measure is presented at a time to assess   R t . To reduce overﬁtting effects , 483 we report results from an ensemble of RNNs trained to similar precision levels . 484 Estimation of the effective reproduction number . We use the R package EpiEstim 35 with a 485 sliding time window of 7 days to estimate the time series of the effective reproduction number R t 486 for every country . We choose an uncertain serial interval following a probability distribution with a 487 mean of 4 . 46 days and a standard deviation of 2 . 63 days 36 . 488 31 .

For each of the four methods ( CC , Lasso regression and RNN ) , we rank the NPI 489 categories in descending order according to their impact , i . e . , the estimated degree to which they 490 lower R t or their feature importance ( RF ) . To obtain a ranking of the eight different themes ( L1 ) 491 of NPIs , we sum the impacts of the 5 highest ranked categories of each theme and then rank the 492 themes according to this cumulative impact . 493 Co - implementation network . We construct the NPI co - implementation network as previously 494 described 20 . If there is a statistical tendency that a country implementing NPI i also implements 495 NPI j later in time , we draw a directed link from i to j . Nodes are placed on the y - axis according to 496 the average epidemic age at which the corresponding NPI is implemented ; they are grouped on the 497 x axis by their L1 theme . Node colours correspond to themes . The effectiveness scores for all NPIs 498 are rescaled between zero and one for each method ; node size is proportional to the rescaled scores , 499 averaged over all methods . 500 Entropic country - level approach . Each territory can be characterised by its socio - economic 501 conditions and the unique temporal sequence of NPIs adopted . To quantify the NPI effect , we 502 measure the heterogeneity of the overall rank of a NPI amongst the countries that have taken that 503 NPI . To compare countries which have implemented different numbers of NPIs , we consider the 504 normalised rankings , where the ranking position is divided by the number of elements in the ranking 505 list ( i . e . , the number of NPIs taken in a speciﬁc country ) . We then bin the interval [ 0 , 1 ] of the 506 normalised rankings into 10 subintervals and compute for each NPI the entropy of the distribution 507 32 .

To assess the conﬁdence of these entropic values , results are compared 510 with expectations from a temporal reshufﬂing of the data . For each country , we keep the same NPIs 511 adopted but reshufﬂe the timestamps of their adoption . 512 Acknowledgements 513 We thank Alexandra Roux for her contribution to the coding of the interventions recorded in 514 the data set used in this study .
