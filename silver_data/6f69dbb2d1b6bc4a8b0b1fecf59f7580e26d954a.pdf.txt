However , its role in taxanes resistance has not been fully established . Gene expression of plasticity - related phenotypes such as epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , stem cell - like and neuroendocrine ( NE ) phenotypes was studied in vitro , in silico , in circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) ( N = 22 ) and in tumor samples ( N = 117 ) from taxanes - treated metastatic castration - resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) patients . Docetaxel ( D ) - resistant cells presented a more pronounced EMT phenotype than cabazitaxel ( CZ ) - resistant cells . In silico analysis revealed ESRP1 down - regulation in taxane - exposed mCRPC samples . Cell plasticity - related changes occurred in CTCs after taxanes treatment . Tumor EMT phenotype was associated with lower PSA progression - free survival ( PFS ) to D ( P < 0 . 001 ) , and better to CZ ( P = 0 . 002 ) . High ESRP1 expression was independently associated with longer PSA - PFS ( P < 0 . 001 ) and radiologic - PFS ( P = 0 . 001 ) in D and shorter PSA - PFS in the CZ cohort ( P = 0 . 041 ) . High SYP expression was independently associated with lower PSA - PFS in D ( P = 0 . 003 ) and overall survival ( OS ) in CZ ( P = 0 . 002 ) , and high EZH2 expression was associated with adverse OS in D - treated patients ( P = 0 . 013 ) . In conclusion , EMT pro ﬁ le in primary tumor is differentially associated with D or CZ bene ﬁ t and NE dedifferentiation correlates with adverse taxanes clinical outcome .

Speci ﬁ cally in prostate cancer ( PC ) cell plasticity allows cancer cells to reprogram and survive despite androgen receptor ( AR ) inhibition , being considered one of the mechanisms involved in androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) resistance ( 1 ) . Throughout this process , tumor cells may develop epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , and / or evolve towards an stem cell - like ( SCL ) or neuroendocrine ( NE ) phenotypes , and it is possible that they acquire mixed or intermediate phenotypes ( 2 , 3 ) . ADT , novel hormone - therapies consisting in AR signaling inhibitors ( ARSI ; abiraterone or enzalutamide ) , and taxanes , chemotherapy agents that act by blocking microtubules depolymerization , are the most used therapies in metastatic PC ( 4 – 8 ) . Today , a high percentage of patients with disseminated PC receive novel hormone - therapies at early stages of disease : in combination with ADT in non - castrate PC , in non - metastatic castration - resistant PC or as ﬁ rst - line treatment for metastatic castration - resistant PC ( mCRPC ) . Taxanes are used after ARSI progression but its clinical activity may be eventually compromised by the development of cell plasticity - related phenotypes ( 9 , 10 ) . Furthermore , different degrees of NE dedifferentiation ( from pure , mixed or intermediate adenocarcinoma / NE phenotypes ) have been observed in biopsies from mCRPC patients who progressed to abiraterone and its presence is associated with an adverse clinical outcome ( 11 ) . Moreover , no speci ﬁ c clinical strategies are de ﬁ ned based on the presence of these phenotypes and no targeted therapies have demonstrated bene ﬁ t in mCRPC patients . On the other hand , although there is growing evidence that tumor cell plasticity is a relevant biological event involved in therapeutic resistance and aggressive evolution of PC , the presence of these cell plasticity related phenotypes already in the primary tumor and its impact in the therapeutic response and clinical outcome has not been fully described . In the present study we investigated the presence and potential role in predicting tumor evolution of EMT , SCL and NE cell plasticity - related phenotypes in CRPC cell lines , in silico , in circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) and in tumor biopsies from mCRPC taxanes - treated patients . MATERIALS AND METHODS Establishment of Taxane - Resistant Cells DU - 145 and PC - 3 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) . They were converted to docetaxel - resistant ( DU - 145DR and PC - 3DR , respectively ) and to cabazitaxel - resistant cells ( DU - 145CZR and PC - 3CZR , respectively ) by exposing them to an initial dose of 1 . 3 nM of docetaxel ( D ) and 0 . 6 nM of cabazitaxel ( CZ ) , respectively , and culturing surviving cells with stepwise increasing doses in an intermittent regimen until a concentration of 6 nM during one year approximately . A subset of parental cells was cultured alongside the resistant ones as a control . All cell lines were authenticated using Human 9 - Marker STR Pro ﬁ le and Interspecies Contamination Test by IDEXX BioAnalytics . DU - 145 and PC - 3 cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium ( Gibco , Life Technologies , Paisley , UK ) and in F - 12K nutrient mixture medium ( Gibco ) , respectively , both supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) . D and CZ drugs ( MedChem Express , Monmouth Junction , NJ , USA ) were dissolved in 10 mM in DMSO . D and CZ - resistant cells were maintained in 2 nM of D or CZ - containing medium , respectively . Cell Viability Assays Cells were seeded at a density of 3 , 000 cells / well in a 96 - well microtiter plate . After 24 h , cells were exposed to D or CZ ( MedChem Express , Monmouth Junction , NJ , USA ) for an additional 72 h . Cell viability was assessed by using Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) according to instructions protocol . Cell Adhesion and Proliferation Measurement Quantitative monitoring of cell adhesion and proliferation was performed using the xCELLigence real - time cell analysis ( RTCA ) system , which measures the change in electrical impedance expressed as the Cell Index ( CI ) . Experiments were carried out in a RTCA DP Instrument ( ACEA Bio - sciences , San Diego , CA , USA ) placed in a humidi ﬁ ed incubator maintained at 37 °C with 5 % CO2 according to manufacturer instructions . Brie ﬂ y , 50 µl of cell - free medium with 10 % FBS was added to the wells of E - 16 plates for background impedance detection , then 5 , 000 cells / well were seeded . Cell Index was monitored for 90 h , the ﬁ rst 4 h every 1 min , then once every 30 min . Monitoring of the cells over the ﬁ rst hours provides adhesion data , while over the subsequent hours provides proliferation data . Each cell line was tested in triplicate . The rate of adhesion and proliferation were determined by calculating the averaged slopes of the curves between two given time points . Data were analyzed by RTCA 2 . 0 software ( ACEA Bio - sciences ) . Cell Migration Assay Cell migration was performed using the Cultrex 96 Well Cell Migration Assay ( Trevigen , Gaithersburg , MD , USA ) for 24 h and quanti ﬁ ed using Calcein - AM according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . Each assay was performed in sextuplicate and the experiment was repeated twice , independently . Western Blot Analysis Whole - cell extracts were prepared and Western blot analysis performed as described previously ( 12 ) . Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked , incubated and washed following the Odyssey System ( Li - Cor Biosciences , Lincoln , NE , USA ) recommendations . Blots were scanned with an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System ( Li - Cor Biosciences ) . Antibodies used were Aurora A ( D3E4Q ) ( AURKA ) ( ref . 14475 ) , AXL ( C89E7 ) ( ref . 8661 ) , CD44 ( 156 - 3C11 ) ( ref . 3570 ) , E - cadherin ( CDH1 ) ( ref . 4065 ) , N - cadherin ( CDH2 ) ( ref . 4061 ) , N - MYC ( D4B2Y ) ( ref . 51705 ) , Synaptophysin ( D35Ea ) ( SYP ) ( ref . 5461 ) , Vimentin ( R28 ) ( VIM ) ( ref . 3932 ) , b - Catenin ( 6B3 ) Jime ´ nez et al . Cell Plasticity and Taxanes Resistance Frontiers in Oncology | www . frontiersin . org November 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 594023 2 ( CTNNB1 ) ( ref . 9582 ) purchased from Cell - Signaling Technology ( Leiden , The Netherlands ) . Actin ( ref . A2066 ) , CHGA ( ref . AMAb90525 ) , ESRP1 ( ref . HPA023719 ) , and Monoclonal Anti - a - Tubulin clone B - 5 - 1 - 2 ( TUB ) ( ref . T5168 ) were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO , USA ) . ZEB1 ( H - 102 ) antibody ( ref . sc - 25388 ) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) . RNA Extraction Total RNA from cell lines and CTCs samples was isolated using the Trizol Reagent ( Tri - reagent solution ; Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol . For microarray hybridizations , RNA from cell lines was puri ﬁ ed ( from aqueous phase of Trizol lysis ) using RNeasy Micro kit ( QIAGEN , Hilden , Germany ) . In case of formalin - ﬁ xed paraf ﬁ n - embedded ( FFPE ) tumor samples , total RNA was isolated using RecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . RNA was quanti ﬁ ed by NanoDrop Spectrophotometer ND - 1000 ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c , Wilmington , MA , USA ) and RNA quality for microarrays was assessed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 ( Agilent , Santa Clara , CA ) . Gene Expression Analysis One m g of total RNA from cell lines and 0 . 5 m g from tissue biopsies and CTCs was reverse transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit ( Life Technologies ) , following manufacturer ’ s instructions . In case of tissues and CTCs samples , cDNA samples were pre - ampli ﬁ ed using TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix kit following manufacturer ' s instructions ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA ) , except that the ﬁ nal reaction volume of the reaction was 12 . 5 m l . Real - time quantitative reverse - transcription PCR ( qRT - PCR ) was performed in duplicate using a StepOne Plus Real - Time PCR system ( Applied Biosystems ) , according to the manufacturer ’ s recommendations . Data were acquired using Step One Software v2 . 2 . 2 . Expression values were based on the quanti ﬁ cation cycle ( Cq ) from target genes relative to the Cq of the housekeeping genes GUSB in cell lines and tissue samples and ACTB in CTCs ( DCq ) . Minus DCq values were considered as the expression level in tissue samples . Relative expression with respect to each reference group studied was reported as fold change or log2ratio . Target genes were ampli ﬁ ed using commercial primers and probes ( Applied Biosystems ) : ACTB ( Hs99999903 _ m1 ) , AURKA ( Hs01582073 _ m1 ) , AXL ( Hs01064444 _ m1 ) , CD44 ( Hs01075861 _ m1 ) , CDH1 ( Hs01023895 _ m1 ) , CDH2 ( Hs00169953 _ m1 ) , CHGA ( Hs00900375 _ m1 ) , CTNBB1 ( Hs00170025 _ m1 ) , ESRP1 ( Hs00214472 _ m1 ) , EZH2 ( Hs00544830 _ m1 ) , GUSB ( Hs99999908 _ m1 ) , MYCN ( Hs00232074 _ m1 ) , SYP ( Hs00300531 _ m1 ) , TC2N ( Hs01120134 _ m1 ) , TWIST1 ( Hs01675818 _ s1 ) , VIM ( Hs00185584 _ m1 ) , ZEB1 ( Hs01566407 _ m1 ) . Microarrays Hybridization and Differential Expression Analysis RNA samples from parental and resistant cell lines were processed using WT PLUS chemistry ( Affymetrix , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . Fragmented and labelled ss - cDNA was prepared according to Affymetrix WT PLUS Reagent Kit user guide . Following fragmentation and terminal labelling , 5 . 2 µg of ss - cDNA were hybridized for 16 h at 45 °C on GeneChip Human Gene 2 . 0 ST Arrays ( Affymetrix , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . Arrays were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 . GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneCHip Scanner 3000 System . Raw expression data from microarrays were normalized using the robust multiarray algorithm ( 13 ) with a custom probe set de ﬁ nition that mapped probes to Entrez Gene IDs ( hugene20st _ Hs _ ENTREZG ) ( 14 ) . After this step , a ﬁ ltering was done to obtain the 5 % genes with the lowest coef ﬁ cient of variation . Finally , to identify differentially expressed genes between the different microarray study groups , we employed LIMMA ( 15 ) to estimate moderated t - statistics and to select statistically differentially expressed genes . Signi ﬁ cant genes were selected if they accomplished a fold change ( | FC | ) ≥ 1 . 5 and false discovery rate ( FDR ) < 0 . 05 . Differentially expressed genes of resistant versus parental cells were mapped against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) pathway database ( 16 ) and analysis was performed using clusterPro ﬁ ler ( v3 . 8 . 1 ) R package . Gene interactions were studied using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ( IPA ) software ( QIAGEN ) . We de ﬁ ned signatures for epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) ( 345 EMT - related genes from the dbEMT database ( 17 ) plus ESRP1 ) , stem cell - like ( SCL ) [ 659 genes from ﬁ ve expression pro ﬁ les ( 18 – 21 ) using StemChecker online ( 22 ) ] and neuroendocrine ( NE ) prostate cancer ( NEPC ) [ 70 NE - related genes from the integrated NEPC score ( 23 ) plus ASCL1 , AURKB , CHGA , and SYP ( 24 ) ] , and tested them in silico in our microarray data . Hierarchical cluster analysis of these signatures was performed using Cluster 3 . 0 ( 25 ) and results were visualized in Java TreeView ( 26 ) . Circulating Tumor Cells Enrichment Blood circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) enrichment was performed using the IsoFlux System ( Fluxion Biosciences , South San Francisco , CA , USA ) . Two 10 mL EDTA tubes were collected from patients before taxanes initiation and after three cycles or at progression . One of the tubes was used for CTCs counting with the IsoFlux CTC Enumeration Kit , according to manufacturer ’ s instructions . CTCs were de ﬁ ned as nucleated cells , morphologically intact , cytokeratin positive and CD45 negative cells . The second EDTA tube was used for gene expression analysis . Brie ﬂ y , peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll ( GE Healthcare , Uppsala , Sweden ) gradient and IsoFlux Rare Cell Enrichment Kit was used to incubate them with customized anti - epithelial cell adhesion molecule ( EPCAM ) , prostate stem cell antigen ( PSCA ) and N - cadherin ( CDH2 ) - coated beads for 2 h at 4 °C . Cell - beads complexes were loaded into Iso ﬂ ux cartridges to be isolated automatically by the instrument . Cells returned by the instrument were stained or total RNA was extracted . In Silico Analysis in Prostate Cancer The alteration status of genes involved in EMT , SCL , and NE cell plasticity related phenotypes was studied in an in silico analysis Jime ´ nez et al . Cell Plasticity and Taxanes Resistance Frontiers in Oncology | www . frontiersin . org November 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 594023 3 including seven PC studies summing a total of 1 , 131 samples ( 23 , 27 – 32 ) obtained from cBioportal for Cancer Genomics platform ( http : / / cbioportal . org ) ( 33 , 34 ) . RNA - seq data from Abida et al . ( 35 ) were also downloaded from cBioportal and analyzed . Boxplots representing log FPKM ( Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million fragments mapped ) were generated by R ( v . 3 . 6 . 3 ) software . Patients and Samples We retrospectively collected tumor samples from patients diagnosed with mCRPC treated with D ( 75 mg / m 2 iv every 3 weeks ) or CZ ( 25 mg / m 2 iv every 3 weeks or 10 mg / m 2 iv weekly ) , both in association with prednisone ( 10 mg / day p . o ) , with available FFPE tumor tissue from several institutions . Patients under the same treatment regimen with the possibility of extracting CTCs samples were prospectively included as a part of an ongoing prospective biomarker study in our institution . Blood samples were extracted before starting treatment and after 3 cycles and / or at time of progression Treatment - response criteria and progressive - disease de ﬁ nitions followed Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria ( 36 ) . Statistical Analysis In vitro experiments data were expressed as mean ± SD and analyzed by Student t - test . All tests were 2 - sided and P - values < 0 . 05 were considered signi ﬁ cant . Optimal cut - offs for gene expression were assessed using maximally selected log - rank statistics ( Maxstat package ) ( 37 ) . PSA progression - free survival ( PFS ) , radiologic - PFS ( RX - PFS ) , and overall survival ( OS ) were calculated from the date of taxanes initiation to PSA progression , radiologic progression , and death or last follow - up visit , respectively , and were evaluated by log - rank test . Univariate analysis of gene expression levels and other clinical variables was performed by Cox regression ; P < 0 . 1 was required for inclusion in multivariate analysis . Test of interaction was performed by entering into proportional hazard models selected multiplicative interaction terms between two binary variables : treatment ( D or CZ ) and ESRP1 expression ( high or low ) . Changes in gene expression in CTCs samples before and after treatment were analyzed by Wilcoxon signed - rank test . SPSS 12 . 0 and R ( v . 3 . 6 . 3 ) softwares were used for statistical analyses . RESULTS Phenotypic Characterization of Docetaxel and Cabazitaxel - Resistant Cells Docetaxel ( D ) and cabazitaxel ( CZ ) resistant cell lines ( DR and CZR , respectively ) were generated from CRPC cell line models DU - 145 and PC - 3 . DU - 145DR and PC - 3DR cells acquired levels of resistance to D that were 1 . 5 to 2 . 1 times higher than their parental cells . The levels of resistance to CZ for DU - 145CZR and PC - 3CZR were 2 . 2 to 4 . 5 times higher than their parental cells ( Figure 1A ) . DR and CZR cells were also resistant to CZ and D , respectively , suggesting the existence of a cross resistance between both agents . Phenotypically , DR differed from CZR cells when compared to parental cells : DR cells were more elongated , with lower adhesion and proliferation , and higher migration rates , while CZR cells were more rounded and similar to parental cells , with similar ( DU - 145 model ) or higher ( PC - 3 model ) adhesion and lower proliferation rates , and without signi ﬁ cant differences in migration rate ( Figures 1B – E ) . These patterns suggest that DR cells have more motility abilities than CZR cells . Differentially Expressed Genes in Taxane - Resistant Versus Parental Cell Lines We performed cDNA microarrays to study the gene expression changes related to taxanes - acquired resistance in the above characterized cell lines . The microarray data analysis revealed 625 and 147 differentially deregulated genes in DR and CZR versus parental cells ( | FC | ≥ 1 . 5 and FDR < 0 . 05 ) , respectively ( Figure 2A and Tables S1 and S2 ) . KEGG pathway enrichment and Ingenuity network analysis showed the relevance of EMT and NFK b pathway in both D and CZ - resistance , among other deregulated pathways . Of note , ESRP1 appeared highly underexpressed in DR models ( Figure S1A – C ) . Twenty - three genes were commonly deregulated in both DR and CZR versus parental cells ( | FC | ≥ 1 . 5 and FDR < 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 2A and Table S3 ) . Among them , ZEB1 and ITGB3 were up - regulated and BMP4 was down - regulated . Ingenuity network analysis showed that the most relevant network had two signi ﬁ cant nodes around EGFR and ITGB3 genes and the EMT - related markers , ZEB1 and TRPC1 , appeared overexpressed ( Figure S1D ) . Differential Expression Analysis in CZ Versus D - Resistant Cells From the microarray data analysis we found 559 genes signi ﬁ cantly commonly deregulated in CZR models versus DR models ( | FC | ≥ 1 . 5 and FDR < 0 . 05 ) ( Table S4 ) . ESRP1 , TC2N , MPZL2 , CDH1 , OCLN , and EPCAM were epithelial - related genes overexpressed in CZR respect to DR cell lines , whereas AXL was down - regulated . Ingenuity network analysis centered the most relevant network on CDH1 and EZH2 ( Figure S1E ) . These results were validated by qRT - PCR and Western Blot . By these techniques it was observed an overall increased expression of mesenchymal markers such as ZEB1 and VIM and a reduced expression of epithelial markers CDH1 and ESRP1 lead by taxanes . This validation supports a more pronounced EMT pro ﬁ le in DR cells ( Figure S2 ) . We de ﬁ ned , based on literature and published gene expression data ( as described in Materials and Methods ) , EMT , SCL , and NE - signatures and tested them in silico in our microarray data . We found 33 EMT , 24 SCL and 4 NE - related genes differentially expressed in CZR versus DR cells ( | FC | ≥ 1 . 5 and FDR < 0 . 05 ) . Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed a different deregulation pattern of EMT ( more pronounced in DR cells ) and SCL - related genes between D and CZ - resistance and more expression of NE markers in CZR than in DR cells ( Figures 2B – D ) .

Cell Plasticity and Taxanes Resistance Frontiers in Oncology | www . frontiersin . org November 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 594023 5 Taxanes Dose - Response Experiments In order to evaluate whether EMT and NE patterns were modi ﬁ able in a dose - dependent manner we treated cell lines with increasing doses of taxanes and evaluated EMT and NE gene expression by qRT - PCR . We observed that D and CZ - treatment induced changes in the expression of EMT and NE markers at different degrees . Notably , CZ exposure signi ﬁ cantly increased ZEB1 and VIM expression in PC - 3 models in a dose - dependent manner , restored ESRP1 expression in DU - 145DR model and decreased AXL levels in DR models but not in CZR cells ( Figure S3 ) . D and CZ - treatment also increased the expression of NE markers SYP , MYCN ( only detected in PC - 3 model ) , and CHGA in a dose - response manner in both resistant models ( Figure S4 ) . All together these results con ﬁ rm the plasticity towards EMT and NE patterns after a short - term drug exposure in vitro .

Cell Plasticity and Taxanes Resistance Frontiers in Oncology | www . frontiersin . org November 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 594023 6 In Silico Analysis of Cell Plasticity - Related Genes in Prostate Cancer A subgroup of cell plasticity related genes was selected among those signi ﬁ cantly deregulated between CZR and DR cell lines ( and validated by qRT - PCR and Western Blot ) to be analyzed in silico in seven PC studies obtained from cBioportal : three studies of primary tumors with 333 ( 30 ) , 240 ( 31 ) , and 57 samples ( 32 ) ; three studies of metastatic PC with 61 ( 27 ) , 176 ( 28 ) , and 150 samples ( 29 ) ; and one study of NEPC with 114 samples ( 23 ) . ESRP1 gene , one of the most differentially deregulated genes between DR and CZR , was mostly ampli ﬁ ed , being this alteration detected in around 5 % of primary tumors , 20 % of metastatic PC , and in 40 % of NEPC . Ampli ﬁ cation of ZEB1 ( 7 . 9 % ) and AXL ( 10 . 5 % ) , both found in NEPC , were also frequent alterations . Otherwise , CDH1 showed a variety of alterations , but most notably was ampli ﬁ ed in NEPC ( 3 . 5 % ) and deleted in primary tumors and in metastatic PC ( 0 . 5 % – 4 . 5 % ) ( Figure 3A and Table S5 ) . We also investigated gene expression changes in tumors from mCRPC patients treated with taxanes , by using RNA - seq data from the study of Abida et al . ( 35 ) Within ARSI - naïve patients , ESRP1 expression was signi ﬁ cantly lower in taxane - exposed respect to taxane - naïve patients ( P = 0 . 007 ) ( Figure 3B ) . Median expression value for AXL , VIM , ZEB1 , AURKA , EZH2 , MYCN , and SYP was higher and for CDH1 was lower in taxane - exposed A B FIGURE 3 | In silico analysis from public datasets .

Cell Plasticity and Taxanes Resistance Frontiers in Oncology | www . frontiersin . org November 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 594023 7 versus taxane - naïve patients , although these differences were not statistically signi ﬁ cant ( Figure S5 ) . These results con ﬁ rm the effect of taxanes in the ESRP1 down - regulation and EMT up - regulation in a clinical sample setting . Cell Plasticity in CTCs Beyond the in silico analysis , we wondered whether molecular plasticity changes could be observed in CTCs samples . Then we collected 47 CTCs - enriched blood samples from 22 mCRPC patients , 17 of them with PSA - progression at post - treatment extraction , and performed qRT - PCR analyses . Patients ’ characteristics ’ are shown in Table 1 . Gene expression patterns in CTCs before and after taxanes treatment showed changes in expression levels of all EMT and NE markers , with high intra - and inter - patient heterogeneity ( Figures 4A , B and Figure S6 ) .

However , ZEB1 expression after treatment was higher in patients with PSA - progression compared to the non - progressing patients ( P = 0 . 035 ) pointing out ZEB1 as a potential marker of taxanes resistance in CTCs ( Figure 4C ) . Cell Plasticity - Related Gene Expression in Non - Castrate Tumor Biopsies and Clinical Outcome In order to con ﬁ rm previous results in another cohort of tumor samples , we collected FFPE tumor tissues from taxanes - treated patients from several Spanish institutions and analyzed gene expression by qRT - PCR . A hundred and seventeen patients were included in this study ( Table 2 ) . For D - treated patients , median follow - up and PSA - PFS were 21 . 3 ( 0 . 9 – 90 . 1 ) and 7 . 7 ( 6 . 1 – 9 . 2 ) months , respectively ; and for CZ - treated patients 12 ( 1 . 3 – 64 . 9 ) and 3 ( 1 . 7 – 4 . 3 ) months , respectively . A gene expression correlation matrix between EMT , SCL , and NE markers ( Figure 5 ) showed signi ﬁ cant positive correlation between EMT markers ( ZEB1 , AXL , VIM , and CDH1 ) , and these with the SCL - marker CD44 . Correlation between NE markers was also positive . This fact suggests that EMT , NE and SCL phenotypes may coexist in primary tumors . Signi ﬁ cant negative correlation was observed between ESRP1 - ZEB1 and ESRP1 - AXL A B C FIGURE 4 | Changes in gene expression markers in circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) samples after taxanes treatment by qRT - PCR .

We observed that high expression of ESRP1 predicted longer PSA - PFS ( hazard ratio [ HR ] 0 . 4 ; 95 % con ﬁ dence interval [ CI ] 0 . 2 – 0 . 6 ; P < 0 . 001 ) and RX - PFS ( HR 0 . 5 ; 95 % CI 0 . 3 – 0 . 8 ; P = 0 . 008 ) to D , but conversely shorter PSA - PFS to CZ ( HR 2 . 2 ; 95 % CI 1 – 4 . 6 ; P = 0 . 038 ) . Moreover , high expression of both ZEB1 ( HR 0 . 4 ; 95 % CI 0 . 2 – 0 . 8 ; P = 0 . 014 ) and AXL ( HR 0 . 3 ; 95 % CI 0 . 2 – 0 . 8 ; P = 0 . 008 ) was associated with a better PSA - PFS to CZ ( Figure 6 ) . The association of other EMT markers with PSA - PFS is shown in the Figure S7 . Then , we de ﬁ ned a group of patients with high - EMT phenotype ( low ESRP1 and high ZEB1 and AXL expression ) and compared it with the rest of patients . High - EMT patients showed a better PSA - PFS to CZ ( HR 0 . 2 ; 95 % CI 0 . 1 – 0 . 6 ; P = 0 . 002 ) , contrary to D ( HR 2 . 8 ; 95 % CI 1 . 6 – 4 . 8 ; P < 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 6A ) .

Cell Plasticity and Taxanes Resistance Frontiers in Oncology | www . frontiersin . org November 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 594023 10 In a multivariate analysis , high ESRP1 expression was independently associated with longer PSA - PFS ( HR 0 . 3 ; 95 % CI 0 . 2 – 0 . 6 ; P < 0 . 001 ) and RX - PFS ( HR 0 . 3 ; 95 % CI 0 . 2 – 0 . 6 ; P = 0 . 001 ) in D - treated patients and shorter PSA - PFS in the CZ - cohort ( HR 3 . 1 ; 95 % CI 1 – 9 . 1 ; P = 0 . 041 ) ( Table S6 and S7 ) . Moreover , there was a signi ﬁ cant interaction between ESRP1 expression levels and D or CZ - treatment related to PSA - PFS ( P < 0 . 001 ) . Respect to OS , in the univariate analysis some EMT markers such as ZEB1 for D - treated patients , AXL for CZ - treated patients and VIM for both were associated with a better OS , but none of them was signi ﬁ cant in the multivariate analysis ( Figure S8 ) . Regarding NE markers , high expression of SYP was associated with shorter PSA - PFS to D ( HR 1 . 7 ; 95 % CI 1 – 2 . 6 ; P = 0 . 033 ) . Moreover , high expression of EZH2 for D ( 19 . 1 vs 25 . 9 months ; HR 1 . 8 ; 95 % CI1 . 1 – 2 . 8 ; P = 0 . 013 ) and SYP forCZ ( 7 . 3vs18months ; HR 3 . 7 ; 95 % CI 1 . 7 – 8 . 1 ; P = 0 . 001 ) correlated with lower OS ( Figure 7 ) . In a multivariate analysis , high SYP expression was independently associated with shorter PSA - PFS in D - treated patients ( HR 2 ; 95 % CI 1 . 3 – 3 . 3 ; P = 0 . 003 ) and worse OS in CZ - treated patients ( HR 5 . 3 ; 95 % CI 1 . 8 – 15 . 4 ; P = 0 . 002 ) ( Tables S6 and S8 ) . DISCUSSION In this study we show that changes in cell plasticity - related phenotypes occur after taxane exposure in in vitro models of CRPC , in CRPC biopsies analyzed in silico , and in CTCs from patients with mCRPC treated with taxanes . We observed that this plasticity appears with different patterns for D and CZ treatments . Moreover , we found that the expression of EMT and NE markers in primary tumors predicts clinical outcome to taxanes in the mCRPC setting . The taxanes D and CZ have shown a survival bene ﬁ t in mCRPC patients ( 4 – 8 ) . Speci ﬁ cally , CZ has shown to be active in patients with progression or low response to D ( 8 , 38 ) and increases survival in patients who have progressed to prior D and abiraterone or enzalutamide ( 39 ) , as demonstrated in randomized clinical trials . The fact that CZ is active in these adverse clinical situations supports that it may overcome the resistance to D or to hormone - therapy . The activity of CZ observed in our series in tumors with EMT phenotype ( as discussed below ) may be a potential explanation . EMT phenotype has been associated by us and others with intrinsic and acquired resistance to D in CRPC ( 9 , 10 ) . Here , we show that DR and CZR cells have several EMT - deregulated genes when compared with parental cells , supporting the relevance of EMT in both D and CZ - resistances ( 9 , 40 , 41 ) . However , EMT features such as elongation , less adhesion and proliferation , and more migration were present in DR cells but not in CZR . Differential expression analysis in CZR versus DR models also revealed a more marked mesenchymal phenotype in DR cells and a more notable epithelial phenotype in CZR cells . These results also suggest that EMT is not a binary state but a FIGURE 5 | Correlation matrix of epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) and neuroendocrine ( NE ) cell plasticity related genes in tissue samples .

It has been described in mice PC models that CZ may revert EMT by redifferentiation of mesenchymal cells into an epithelial phenotype ( 43 ) . Accordingly , in this work we found that CZ restored ESRP1 expression in DU - 145DR cells and decreased AXL levels in DR models . This may suggest a potential explanation of the distinct clinical bene ﬁ t observed in our series between D and CZ according to EMT phenotype . There has been recent emerging evidence in the literature about the capacity of androgen suppression and ARSI to induce a NE phenotype ( 2 ) . However , whether taxanes could also be partly responsible of a NE growing pattern needs to be further explored . Increased levels of the NE markers SYP , MYCN , and CHGA in dose - response experiments with taxanes are a novel observation of this study , reinforcing the hypothesis that chemotherapy could also contribute to the acquisition of a NE phenotype .

Cell Plasticity and Taxanes Resistance Frontiers in Oncology | www . frontiersin . org November 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 594023 12 ESRP1 expression has been recently considered an independent prognostic biomarker in early PC ( 44 ) . In silico analyses suggest that ESRP1 could be an important driver in tumor progression and NE differentiation , since its ampli ﬁ cation frequency increase from primary tumors to NEPC . In our series we found that ESRP1 expression in tumor positively correlated with NE markers , such as AURKA and EZH2 , and negatively with the EMT markers ZEB1 and AXL . ESRP1 mediates alternative splicing of a panel of transcripts involved in maintaining epithelial features , becoming then an important EMT regulator ( 45 ) . During EMT , direct repression of ESRP1 expression through ZEB1 occurs ( 46 ) , with subsequent changes in protein isoforms that regulate actin cytoskeleton , cell adhesion , migration and cell polarity , providing cells with mesenchymal characteristics ( 45 ) . ESRP1 could be also important in regulating other cell plasticity phenotypes , since overlapping between signaling pathways involved in these mechanisms has been described ( 2 ) . We also observed changes in EMT and NE markers in mRNA expression after taxanes treatment in CTCs from mCRPC patients . It has been described that the majority of CTCs exhibits an intermediate EMT phenotype with both epithelial and mesenchymal markers ( 42 , 47 ) , thus we considered to use a customized mixture of antibodies ( PSCA , EPCAM , and CDH2 ) in order to capture prostatic CTCs with epithelial and / or mesenchymal characteristics . The high intra and inter - patient heterogeneity observed may be probably translating the complexity to study in patients the cell plasticity process . Of note , ZEB1 post - treatment expression was higher in those patients with PSA - progression at the time of CTCs analysis , supporting the role of EMT in taxane resistance in patients . CDH1 expression was also signi ﬁ cantly higher in post - treatment samples . The fact that CDH1 may have a role in CTCs clusters formation ( 48 , 49 ) contributing to cell migration and spread , could account for this result . Results from this study also suggest that primary tumor phenotype can affect taxane bene ﬁ t during CRPC , which may be different between D and CZ . Here we de ﬁ ned an EMT - expression pattern characterized by ESRP1 down - regulation and ZEB1 and AXL overexpression , which correlated with a better PSA - PFS to CZ and poorer to D . This observation reinforces the existence of a different mechanism of action for each taxane , depending on the EMT pro ﬁ le , and the potential role of CZ in the reversion of the EMT phenotype ( 43 ) . We also found that high ESRP1 expression independently predicted better PSA - PFS to D , but worse to CZ . Moreover , a signi ﬁ cant interaction between the type of taxane treatment and ESRP1 levels regarding PSA - PFS was observed . In relation with that , RNA - seq data from Abida et al . ( 35 ) supported the in vitro ﬁ ndings regarding the diminishing levels of ESRP1 mRNA after taxanes - exposure . These results agree with the acquisition of EMT phenotypic changes by taxanes treatment . Overall , these data suggest that ESRP1 may be a potential biomarker of taxane sensitivity , although a prospective validation is required . In our series , EMT was not associated with a lower OS . While the role of EMT in resistance to therapy and progression of the disease is well supported by the literature ( 50 ) , there are , however , some discrepancies regarding its association with OS ( 51 , 52 ) . These controversies may arise from the heterogeneity of the tumors , the spectrum of EMT phenotypes induced by different treatments and their different implication in metastasis ( 47 ) , as well as the different methodologies used . According to NE dedifferentiation , we show that the expression of NE markers in primary tumor is associated with adverse outcome in patients treated with D or CZ . Recently , a randomized phase II trial of CZ vs CZ - Carboplatin in mCRPC patients have shown more activity , PSA - PFS and OS of the combination ( 53 ) . Thus , the early introduction of carboplatin in patients with NE expression in primary tumors may be explored as a strategy to improve clinical outcome of these patients .

Cell Plasticity and Taxanes Resistance Frontiers in Oncology | www . frontiersin . org November 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 594023 13 In conclusion , this study supports the role of tumor cell plasticity in clinical outcome of mCRPC patients as well as in primary ( when present in primary non - castrate tumors ) and acquired resistance to taxanes . The EMT pro ﬁ le expression in primary tumor is differentially associated with D or CZ bene ﬁ t and NE dedifferentiation is associated with adverse outcome to D or CZ . Further research of this complex process in longer series of patients is needed to validate these results .
