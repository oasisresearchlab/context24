And we owe a debt to accident for some of our deepest scientific knowledge , including Newton ' s theory of gravitation , the Big Bang theory of Creation , and the discovery of DNA . Even the Rosetta Stone , the Dead Sea Scrolls , and the ruins of Pompeii came to light through chance . This book tells the fascinating stories of these and other discoveries and reveals how the inquisitive human mind turns accident into discovery . Written for the layman , yet scientifically accurate , this illuminating collection of anecdotes portrays invention and discovery as quintessentially human acts , due in part to curiosity , perserverance , and luck .
