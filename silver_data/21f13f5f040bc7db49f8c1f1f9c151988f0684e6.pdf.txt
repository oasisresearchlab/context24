Co ﬁ lin is inactivated by phosphorylation on Ser - 3 by LIM - kinase1 ( LIMK1 ) and is activated when protein phosphatase Slingshot - 1L ( SSH1L ) dephosphorylates this residue . The authors have shown that Ca 2 + - induced co ﬁ lin dephosphorylation is medi - ated by calcineurin ( Cn ) - dependent activation of SSH1L . In this study , Ca 2 + / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII ) is shown to neg - atively regulate SSH1L activity and bind to SSH1L in a complex with 14 - 3 - 3 . Phosphorylation of LIMK1 by CaMKII and its subsequent acti - vation regulates the subcellular localization of SSH1L . Based on these ﬁ ndings , the authors suggest that CaMKII and Cn provide a switch - like mechanism that controls Ca 2 + - dependent LIMK1 , SSH1L and co ﬁ lin activation , and subsequently actin cytoskeletal reorganization .

[ Am J Med Sci 2012 ; 344 ( 6 ) : 462 – 472 . ] A ctin cytoskeletal reorganization is essential for numerous cellular activities , including migration , morphology changes and vesicle transport . 1 Rapid turnover of actin ﬁ la - ments is essential for the formation and maintenance of mem - brane protrusions for cell migration . 2 Co ﬁ lin is a potent regulator of actin ﬁ lament dynamics and mediates its rapid turnover by severing the actin ﬁ laments and stimulating disas - sembly near the leading edge . 3 Co ﬁ lin activity is inhibited by phosphorylation at Ser - 3 by LIM kinases and TES kinases and reactivated by dephosphorylated at Ser - 3 by Slingshot ( SSH ) and chronophin . 1 , 4 Regulation of these individual pathways ulti - mately functions to induce changes in the actin cytoskeleton . LIM - kinase1 ( LIMK1 ) is activated in response to various extracellular stimuli , including lysophosphatidic acid , stromal cell - derived factor - 1 and insulin , through Rho family small GTPases , Rho , Rac , Cdc42 and their downstream protein kinases , such as ROCK and PAK . 2 , 5 Genetic and biochemical analyses have led to identi ﬁ cation of phosphatases , which dephosphorylate co ﬁ lin , including the SSH family of protein phosphatases ( SSH in Drosophila and SSH1L , SSH2L and SSH3L in mammals ) . SSH family members speci ﬁ cally dephos - phorylate Ser - 3 of co ﬁ lin ( P - co ﬁ lin ) both in vitro and in vivo . 1 LIMK1 - and SSH1L - mediated spatiotemporal regulation of co ﬁ lin activity is critical for chemokine - induced polarized lamellipodium formation and directional cell movement . 3 A previous study 6 showed that 14 - 3 - 3 proteins inhibit SSH1L activity by sequestration in the cytoplasm , which is dependent on phosphorylation of SSH1L at Ser - 937 and Ser - 978 . Calcineurin ( Cn ) , a Ca 2 + / calmodulin ( CaM ) - dependent protein phosphatase , also called protein phosphatase 2B was shown to mediate Ca 2 + - induced SSH1L activation and co ﬁ lin dephosphorylation . Knockdown of SSH1L expression by RNA interference abolished A23187 - and Cn - induced co ﬁ lin dephos - phorylation . 1 Cn dephosphorylates SSH1L and increases SSH1L - mediated dephosphorylation of co ﬁ lin in cell - free assays . 1 However , the precise mechanism of Cn - mediated SSH1L activation is still unclear and additional studies are necessary to identify the pathways involved in this process . We propose a novel signaling cascade by which Ca 2 + - induced Cn activation results in SSH1L - mediated co ﬁ lin dephosphorylation and activation . Numerous Ca 2 + - evoked responses are mediated by the Ca 2 + - binding protein , CaM and its downstream Ca 2 + / CaM - dependent protein kinases ( CaMKs ) , including CaMKI , CaMKII , CaMKIV and CaMK - kinase ( CaMKK ) . 7 We have already provided evidence that LIMK1 - mediated co ﬁ lin phosphorylation is critical for calcium ionophore ( ionomycin ) - induced neurite outgrowth and that CaMKIV mediates ionomycin - induced LIMK1 activation . 8 In this study , we show that CaMKII and Cn phosphatase are switch - like mechanisms that control Ca 2 + - dependent SSH1L / LIMK1 activation . Furthermore , we demonstrate that the bal - ance between CaMKII and Cn activities controls co ﬁ lin activity and actin cytoskeletal reorganization .

To determine the effect of SSH1L expression or LIMK1 knock - down , MCF7 cells were cotransfected with pPURO ( Clontech , Mountain View , CA ) and CFP - SSH1L or pSUPER - LIMK1 , respectively ( molar ratio 1 : 5 ) , and were selected using 1 m g / mL puromycin .

Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene di ﬂ uoride membranes . The membranes were western blotted using anti - P - co ﬁ lin , anti - P - LIMK1 ( Thr508 ) or anti - P - CaMKII antibodies , as described previously . 17 In Vitro Phosphatase Assay of SSH1L Co ﬁ lin - His 6 expressed in Vero cells was puri ﬁ ed and used as a substrate for in vitro phosphatase reactions as described previously . 1 To examine the effect of Cn or CaMKII on both SSH1L ( WT ) and the SSH1L ( 2SA ) mutant in cell - free assays , lysates from 293T cells expressing Myc - SSH1L ( WT ) or Myc - SSH1L ( 2SA ) were immunoprecipitated with anti - Myc antibody or control IgG . The precipitates were incubated for 2 hours at 30 8 C with 7 . 5 U / m L recombinant active Cn A a con - taining Cn B subunit or 0 . 6 m g / mL CaMKII ( Speci ﬁ c activity : 2 . 14 U / mg ) , 20 m g / mL CaM and 6 . 3 m g / mL co ﬁ lin - His 6 in 20 m L of reaction buffer ( 50 mM N - 2 - hydroxyethylpipera - zine - N 9 - 2 - ethanesulfonic acid , pH 5 7 . 4 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 0 . 5 mg / mL bovine serum albumin and 1 m g / mL leupeptin ) .

In Vitro Kinase Assay Myc - LIMK1 and its mutants were expressed in 293T cells and cells were serum starved for 16 hours and treated with 5 m M A23187 for 10 minutes . Cells were lysed and LIMK1 was immunoprecipitated with anti - LIMK1 antibody or anti - Myc antibody . Samples were then subjected to an in vitro kinase reaction to determine LIMK1 kinase activity . His 6 - co ﬁ lin was used as a substrate in the presence or absence of 0 . 6 m g / mL recombinant active CaMKII ( speci ﬁ c activity : 2 . 14 U / mg , Upstate Biotechnology Inc . ) , as described previ - ously . 18 For LIMK1 - catalyzed SSH1L phosphorylation , Myc - ( His ) 6 - SSH1L ( CS ) was expressed in 293T cells and puri ﬁ ed with Ni - NTA agarose and used as a substrate . HA - LIMK1 and its mutants expressed in 293T cells were immunoprecipitated and incubated for 40 minutes at 30 8 C with 3 m g / mL SSH1L substrate in 20 mL lysis / kinase buffer containing 100 m M ATP and 5 m Ci [ g 32 P ] ATP . To determine whether CaMKII - catalyzed SSH1L phosphorylation , Myc - SSH1L and its mutants were expressed in 293T cells , immunoprecipitated with anti - Myc antibody and incubated in 20 mL lysis / kinase buffer containing 100 m M ATP and 5 m Ci [ g 32 P ] ATP with 0 . 6 m g / mL recombinant active CaMKII at 30 8 C for 40 mi - nutes .

RESULTS Ca 2 + Ionophore , A23187 , Stimulates Accumulation of SSH1L and Coﬁlin Around the Membrane Periphery Ca 2 + is a versatile intracellular signaling mediator that can regulate many different cellular processes , including those related to actin cytoskeletal rearrangement . To examine the mechanisms by which Ca 2 + / Cn regulates SSH1L / co ﬁ lin activ - ity , we examined the distribution of SSH1L before and after 5 m M A23187 stimulation of MCF - 7 cells . MCF - 7 is a good cell line in which to study calcium response pathways because they are highly sensitive to Ca 2 + signals . CFP - tagged SSH1L was diffusely distributed in the absence of A23187 , but accumulated at the F - actin - rich membrane periphery in the presence of A23187 ( Figure 1A ) . These data indicate that 5 m M A23187 induces SSH1L activation and , subsequently , co ﬁ lin dephos - phorylation at the cell periphery . Next , we examined the colocalization of co ﬁ lin and P - co ﬁ lin with YFP - SSH1L in MCF - 7 cells after stimulating with 5 m M A23187 . Immunos - taining with antico ﬁ lin , anti - P - co ﬁ lin and anti - YFP antibody revealed that co ﬁ lin , but not P - co ﬁ lin , accumulated in the YFP - SSH1L - rich membrane periphery after stimulating with 5 m M A23187 ( Figure 1B ) . Together , these results suggest that enhanced dephosphorylation of co ﬁ lin by SSH1L generally occurs at the membrane periphery where rapid actin turnover is required . Relationship Between SSH1L and Cn We had previously proposed a Ca 2 + - Cn - SSH1L - co ﬁ lin sig - naling cascade leading to dephosphorylation and activation of co ﬁ lin . 1 To further de ﬁ ne the relationship between SSH1L and Cn , we used Cn mutants to constitutively activate or deactivate FIGURE 3 .

CnA ( WT ) , D CnA ( a constitutively active form of Cn ) or D CnA ( H160Q ) ( a dominant - negative form of Cn ) were cotransfected into 293T with either Myc - SSH1L ( WT ) or Myc - SSH1L ( CS ) ( a phosphatase - dead mutant ) and immu - noprecipitations were performed using mouse anti - Myc mAb . Results show that all Cn proteins speci ﬁ cally bind to SSH1L ( Figure 2A ) . These data suggest that Cn protein binding to SSH1L is not related to Cn activity and / or SSH1L activity . Next , we examined which region in Cn binds to SHH1L by coexpressing either SSH1L ( WT ) or its mutants ( N , NP , P , PC and C ) with D CnA ( H160Q ) in 293T cells . Western blot analysis showed that CnA ( H160Q ) speci ﬁ cally binds to the C - terminal region or phosphatase domain of SSH1L ( Figure 2B ) . To examine the effect that Cn has on the sub - cellular localization of SSH1L , MCF - 7 cells were cotrans - fected with CFP - SSH1L and HA - tagged D CnA plasmids . Immunostaining revealed that both CFP - SSH1L and HA - D CnA were diffusely localized in the cytoplasm and cell periphery ( Figure 2C ) , suggesting that active Cn failed to induce accumulation of SSH1L around the membrane periph - ery without Ca 2 + stimulation . Cn suppresses A23187 - Induced CaMKII Activation CaMKII is a Ca 2 + - activated serine / threonine kinase that regulates the activity of target proteins by phosphorylation . 11 Increased Ca 2 + concentration has been shown to activate type 2B Ca 2 + / CaM - dependent phosphatase , Cn and the Ca 2 + / CaM - dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII ) in myocytes . 12 Further - more , Cn - mediated NFAT activity and activated Cn induces cardiac hypertrophy by dephosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of transcription factors associated with the NFAT family ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) and expression of speci ﬁ c hypertrophic target genes . 19 – 22 We therefore determined whether A23187 treatment resulted in Cn - mediated dephosphorylation of NFAT in a time - dependent manner , as indicated by an increase in the faster migrating band ( Figure 3A ) . To explore whether Ca 2 + - induced signaling pathways mediate co ﬁ lin dephosphorylation , FIGURE 4 .

Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti - P - coﬁlin , anticoﬁlin , anti - Ps978 - SSH1L and anti - Myc antibodies as indicated .

Serum - starved 293T cell were treated with various concentrations of A23187 for 10 minutes at 37 8 C . Cells were lysed , endogenous LIMK1 was immunoprecipitated , and precipitate was subjected to an in vitro kinase reaction using His 6 - coﬁlin as a substrate . Samples were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) and phos - phorylation was visualized using autoradiography . Western blot was performed using anti - LIMK1 antibody to determine the amount of LIMK1 in the reaction . The relative kinase activity of LIMK1 is represented as the mean 6 SD for triplicate experiments . Zhao et al 466 Volume 344 , Number 6 , December 2012 we ﬁ rst examined the effects of treatment with the Ca 2 + iono - phore , A23187 on P - co ﬁ lin levels in cultured cells . Serum - starved 293T cells were treated with 5 m M A23187 for different time periods , and cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting using anti - P - co ﬁ lin and antico ﬁ lin antibodies . Treating 293T cells with A23187 signi ﬁ cantly decreased the level of P - co ﬁ lin in a time - dependent manner without affecting the total co ﬁ lin levels ( Figure 3B ) . Consistent with a previous report , preincuba - tion of 293T cells with the Cn inhibitor , cypermethrin ( 100 nM ) , followed by treatment with 5 m M A23187 for 1 , 3 , 5 or 10 mi - nutes , almost completely inhibited A23187 - induced co ﬁ lin dephosphorylation ( Figure 3C ) . 1 When 293T cells were pre - treated with 10 m M KN93 , an inhibitor of CaMKII , A23187 - induced co ﬁ lin dephosphorylation was signi ﬁ cantly enhanced ( Figure 3C ) . Collectively , these results demonstrate that the inhi - bition of CaMKII activity plays a crucial role in Ca 2 + - induced co ﬁ lin dephosphorylation / activation . To examine the changes in CaMKII activity by Ca 2 + stimulation , serum - starved 293T cells were stimulated with 5 m M A23187 for different time periods , and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti - CaMII d or control IgG antibody . The precipitates were then analyzed by Western blotting with anti - CaMKII d and P - ( Thr287 ) - CaMKII . P - CaMKII levels increased by 1 minute and decreased below the basal level by 3 to 10 minutes after A23187 stimulation ( Figure 3D ) , which shows that 5 m M A23187 suppresses CaMKII activity in the late stages Ca 2 + stimulation and suggests that there is another mechanism that activates CaMKII early . Furthermore , pretreat - ment with the Cn inhibitor , cypermethrin , prevented the reduc - tion in CaMKII phosphorylation induced by Ca 2 + and further increased P - CaMKII levels ( Figure 3E ) . These data suggest that A23187 treatment suppresses CaMKII activity through Cn in the late stages . When CaMKII d was coexpressed with either SSH1L ( WT ) or SSH1L ( CS ) and D CnA or D CnA ( H160Q ) in 293T cells , CaMKII activity was suppressed by active Cn but not SSH1L ( Figure 3F ) . These ﬁ ndings suggest that Cn - medi - ated inhibition of CaMKII kinase activity is critical for mediat - ing Ca 2 + / Cn - induced co ﬁ lin dephosphorylation . Ca 2 + Ionophore Induces CaMKII d and LIMK1 Activation But Suppresses SSH1L Activation in a Dose - Dependent Manner A23187 is a Ca2 + ionophore that induces release of cytosolic Ca2 + , potentially increasing ATP turnover due to activation of Ca2 + pumps . Previous studies have indicated that A23187 increases intracellular Ca2 + levels in a dose - and time - dependent manner , 23 – 25 which is in accordance with our data ( data not shown ) . We have shown that A23187 - induced co ﬁ lin dephosphorylation occurs in a time - dependent manner . The levels of phosphorylated co ﬁ lin , CaMKII , SSH1L and LIMK1 increased with A23187 treatment and were maintained throughout the 10 - minute treatment period . The level of phosphorylation of all proteins examined peaked at 1 m M A23187 treatment and the phosphorylation levels decreased with increasing Ca 2 + concentrations ( Figure 4A , B , D , E ) . These results indicate that 1 m M A23187 induces CaMKII d ( Figure 4D ) and LIMK1 ( Figure 4E ) activation , but suppresses SSH1L activation , possibly through phosphorylation of the Ser - 937 and Ser - 978 residues ( Figure 4B ) . CaMKII d and LIMK1 activation peaked at 1 m M A23187 treatment . Expression of SSH1L ( 2SA ) ( SSH1L mutant where Ser - 937 and Ser - 978 were both replaced by alanine ) in 293T cells almost completely suppressed 1 m M A23187 - induced phosphorylation of co ﬁ lin ( Figure 4C ) , demonstrating that phosphorylation of these residues is critical for SSH1L - medi - ated activation of co ﬁ lin activity . Furthermore , stimulation with 1 m M A23187 , resulted in an accumulation of SSH1L and actin ﬁ laments ; however , they did not migrate to the cell periphery ( Figure 5 ) . These ﬁ ndings suggest that Ca 2 + ionophore induces activation of CaMKII and LIMK1 , but suppresses SSH1L activity by Ser - 937 and Ser - 978 phosphorylation . Low Ca 2 + FIGURE 5 .

( B ) KN93 inhibits A23187 - induced effects on the membrane periphery .

CaMKII Mediates Phosphorylation , Activation and Subcellular Localization of SSH1L by Ser - 937 and Ser - 978 Phosphorylation The C - terminus of SSH1L contains residue sequences ( LTRSSS937S , LKRSHS978L ) , which match the CaMKII consensus sequence ( I / L ) XRXX ( S / T ) 16 ( Figure 6A ) . Therefore , we examined whether CaMKII binds to SSH - 1L through these residues . CaMKII d 2 was coexpressed with Myc - SSH1L ( WT ) or Myc - SSH1L ( 2SA ) and samples were analyzed by immuno - precipitation with anti - Myc mAb . CaMKII speci ﬁ cally binds in a complex with SSH1L ( WT ) and 14 - 3 - 3 ( Figure 6B ) . How - ever , both CaMKII and 14 - 3 - 3 proteins failed to associate with SSH1L ( 2SA ) ( Figure 6B ) . Next , we analyzed the ability of CaMKII to phosphorylate SSH1L and its mutants ( 2SA ) in vitro . SSH1L ( WT ) , but not SSH1L ( 2SA ) was phosphory - lated by CaMKII , which was completely inhibited by the CaM - KII inhibitor KN93 ( Figure 6C ) . These ﬁ ndings demonstrate that CaMKII phosphorylates SSH1L at Ser - 978 and Ser - 937 , and we hypothesize that this event is required to inhibit SSH1L activation . Therefore , we analyzed changes in the phosphatase activity of different SSH1L constructs . The activation of SSH1L ( WT ) ( Figure 7A ) , but not SSH1L ( 2SA ) ( Figure 7B ) , was in - hibited by CaMKII . In addition , overexpression of SSH1L ( 2SA ) suppressed 5 m M A23187 - induced accumulation of SSH1L and actin around the membrane periphery ( Figure 7C ) . These observations indicate that CaMKII mediates phosphory - lation , activation and subcellular localization of SSH1L and that this event was dependent on Ser - 937 and Ser - 978 phosphorylation . LIMK1 Is Upregulated by CaMKII and Mediates Subcellular Localization of SSH1L Directly We next examined whether LIMK1 activity plays a role in Ca 2 + - induced actin remodeling . Serum - starved 293T cells were treated with 5 m M A23187 and Western blot analysis was per - formed using anti - Thr - 508 antibody to detect active LIMK1 . Results show that P - LIMK1 levels increased by 1 minute and then decreased below the basal level by 3 to 10 minutes after A23187 stimulation ( Figure 8A ) . Furthermore , pretreatment with the Cn inhibitor cypermethrin prevented this increase at 1 minute posttreatment ( Figure 8B ) , indicating that Cn is required for Ca 2 + - induced LIMK1 activation . Interestingly , the LIMK1 activation pro ﬁ le is similar to that of CaMKII ( Figures 3D and 8A ) . To determine whether LIMK1 interacts with CaMKII , LIMK1 and its mutants [ D460A ( DA ) and T508A ] expressed in 293T cells were immunoprecipitated with anti - Myc antibody , and in vitro kinase assays were performed to determine whether CAMKII phosphorylates LIMK1 . The results show that LIMK1 ( WT ) and the kinase - dead form LIMK1 ( DA ) were FIGURE 6 . Calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII ) proteins bind to and inhibit Slingshot - 1L ( SSH1L ) , by Ser - 937 and Ser - 978 phosphorylation . ( A ) Alignment of the CaMKII consensus sequence and the 2 potential CaMKII motifs in SSH1L . ( B ) CaMKII interacts with SSH1L and is dependent on Ser - 937 and Ser - 978 phosphorylation . 293T cells were transfected with CaMKII d ( WT ) only or co - transfected with CaMKII d ( WT ) and either Myc - SSH1L ( WT ) or Myc - SSH1L ( 2SA ) . Samples were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) and Western blotting was performed using anti - Myc mAb . ( C ) SSH1L is phosphory - lated by CaMKII by Ser - 937 and Ser - 978 . Lysates of 293T cells expressing WT and deletion mutants of Myc - SSH1L were im - munoprecipitated with anti - Myc antibody . Reaction mixtures were analyzed by autoradiography . SSH1L WT and mutants were analyzed by Western blotting with anti - Myc antibody . Zhao et al 468 Volume 344 , Number 6 , December 2012 phosphorylated by CAMKII . However , CaMKII failed to phos - phorylate LIMK1 ( T508A ) , a mutant in which Thr - 508 was replaced by a nonphosphorylatable alanine . These results suggest that LIMK1 is activated by CaMKII through Thr - 508 ( Figure 8C ) . Next , we examined the interaction between LIMK1 and SSH1L . LIMK1 ( WT ) , constitutively active forms ( TEE or T508V ) , or the dominant - negative forms ( DA ) of LIMK1 were coexpressed with Myc - SSH1L ( CS ) in 293T cells . Immuno - precipitations with anti - Myc antibody were performed on cell lysates , and in vitro kinase assays were performed to determine whether LIMK1 phosphorylates SSH1L . SSH1L was phosphor - ylated by LIMK ( WT ) , LIMK ( TEE ) and LIMK ( T508V ) , but not LIMK1 ( DA ) ( Figure 8D ) . We constructed a LIMK1 RNAi plasmid to suppress expression of endogenous LIMK1 in 293T cells ( Figure 9A ) . Coexpression of LIMK1 siRNA with CFP - SSH1L ( 5 : 1 ) suppressed 1 m M A23187 - induced intracellular accumulation of SSH1L and F - actin , and 5 m M A23187 - induced accumulation of SSH1L and F - actin around the mem - brane periphery ( Figure 9B ) . MCF7 cells were cotransfected with cyan ﬂ uorescence protein ( CFP ) - tagged wild - type LIMK1 [ LIMK1 ( WT ) - CFP ] or YFP - SSH1L , and cells were stained with rhodamine - phalloidin to visualize F - actin ( Figure 9C ) . Expression of LIMK1 ( WT ) - CFP alone caused a marked increase in the induction of thick stress ﬁ bers . However , coex - pression with LIMK1 ( WT ) - CFP and YFP - SSH1L caused accu - mulation of SSH1L and F - actin around the membrane periphery . These results suggest that LIMK1 plays a critical role in mediating subcellular localization of SSH1L and F - actin directly . DISCUSSION We had previously proposed a novel signaling cascade of Ca 2 + - Cn - SSH1L - co ﬁ lin for Ca 2 + signaling - induced co ﬁ lin dephosphorylation and activation . 1 In this study , we show that CaMKII and Cn phosphatase provide a switch - like mechanism that controls Ca 2 + - dependent SSH1L / LIMK1 activation . The balance of CaMKII / Cn activities controls co ﬁ lin activation and membrane periphery formation ( Figure 10 ) . CaM induces multiple CaMKs , including CaMKI , CaMKII , CaMKIV and CaMKK . KN93 inhibits the kinase activities of CaMKI , CaM - KII and CaMKIV . STO - 609 inhibits CaMKK and activates CaMKI and CaMKIV , but not CaMKII . 7 In our study , we used both KN93 and STO - 609 to determine the CaMKs required for Ca 2 + - induced co ﬁ lin phosphorylation / activation . Pretreatment with KN93 almost completely blocked A23187 - induced co ﬁ lin phosphorylation , but pretreatment with STO - 609 had almost no effect on A23187 - induced co ﬁ lin phosphorylation ( data not shown ) . Therefore , CaMKII is required for A23187 - induced co ﬁ lin phosphorylation . We previously reported that Cn dephosphorylates SSH1L , increasing SSH1L - mediated co ﬁ lin dephosphorylation in cell - free assays , and that knockdown of SSH1L expression by RNAi prevents A23187 - or Cn - induced co ﬁ lin dephosphor - ylation . 1 Stimulation with A23187 leads to an accumulation of SSH1L and actin ﬁ laments around the membrane periphery . Co ﬁ lin also accumulates at the membrane periphery indicating FIGURE 7 . Phosphorylation , activa - tion and subcellular localization of Slingshot - 1L ( SSH1L ) by calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII ) is independent on Ser - 937 and Ser - 978 phosphorylation . ( A ) Lysates of 293T cells expressing Myc - SSH1L ( WT ) or Myc - SSH1L ( 2SA ) ( B ) were immunoprecipitated with anti - Myc antibody or control IgG . Reaction mixtures were analyzed by Western blotting with indicated antibodies . ( C ) SSH1L ( 2SA ) failed to accumu - late at the membrane periphery in response to Ca 2 + - stimulation . MCF - 7 cells were transfected with a plasmid coding for CFP - SSH1L ( 2SA ) , then left untreated or stimu - lated with 5 m M A23187 for 10 mi - nutes at 37 8 C . Images were obtained by using a laser scanning confocal microscopy . Scale bar , 20 m M . Regulation of Coﬁlin Activity (cid:1) 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 469 that co ﬁ lin is dephosphorylated in this area . Inhibition of SSH1L activity by 14 - 3 - 3 was dependent on SSH1L phosphorylation at Ser - 937 and Ser - 978 . 6 Our results show that Cn protein specially binds to and activates SSH1L independently of Ser - 978 and Ser - 937 phosphorylation ( data not shown ) . In addition , active Cn fails to stimulate accumulation of SSH1L around the membrane periphery without Ca 2 + stimulation , suggesting that activation of an additional pathway ( s ) by Ca 2 + activity is required . CaMKII is activated by autophosphorylation of Thr287 . In our study , phospho - CaMKII levels were increased by 1 to 3 minutes after A23187 treatment and decreased below the basal level by 5 minutes . A23187 - induced co ﬁ lin dephosphorylation was signi ﬁ cantly enhanced after 293T cells were pretreated with 10 m M KN - 93 , a speci ﬁ c inhibitor of CaMKII , suggesting that CaMKII plays a crucial role in Ca 2 + - induced co ﬁ lin activation . Furthermore , Ca 2 + - induced CaMKII phosphoryla - tion and co ﬁ lin dephosphorylation was almost completely blocked by pretreatment with the Cn inhibitor cypermethrin . These results suggest that treatment with 5 m M A23187 leads to Cn dephosphorylation and inactivation of CaMKII in the late stages . Our coimmunoprecipitation results indicated that CaMKII activity was suppressed by active Cn , but not SSH1L . Furthermore , our in vitro kinase assay showed that CaMKII phosphorylated SSH1L ( WT ) , but not SSH1L ( 2SA ) , which was convincingly inhibited by KN93 . CaMKII speci ﬁ cally binds to and inhibits the activation of SSH1L ( WT ) in a complex with 14 - 3 - 3 proteins . However , CaMKII failed to bind or inhibit the activation of SSH1L ( 2SA ) . In addition , transfected SSH1L ( 2SA ) treatment suppressed 5 m M A23187 - induced accumulation of SSH1L and actin around the membrane periphery . These observations suggest that CaMKII mediated phosphorylation , activation and sub - cellular localization of SSH1L is dependent on Ser - 937 and Ser - 978 phosphorylation . The LIMK1 structure is comprised of 2 LIM domains and a PDZ domain at the N - terminus and a kinase domain at the C - terminus . 9 Here , we have demonstrated that phos - phorylation / activation of LIMK1 at Thr - 508 is upregulated in a time - dependent manner by CaMKII during A23187 treatment . FIGURE 8 . LIM - kinase1 ( LIMK1 ) is phosphorylated and activated by calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII ) on the Thr - 508 residue and mediates Ca2 + signaling - induced changes at the membrane periphery . ( A ) A23187 - induced changes in P - LIMK1 levels . 293T cells transfected with HA - LIMK1 were serum starved for 16 hours , then stimulated with 5 m M A23187 for the indicated stages . Cell lysates were Western blotted with indicated antibodies . ( B ) Calcineurin ( Cn ) is required for A23187 - induced changes in P - LIMK1 levels . Serum - starved 293T cells were pretreated with cypermethrin and then stimulated with 5 m M A23187 for the indicated times . Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies . ( C ) LIMK1 is phosphorylated by CaMKII on the Thr508 residue , enhancing its kinase activity . Lysates of 293T cells expressing WT and point mutants of Myc - LIMK1 were immunoprecipitated and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) - polyacrylamide gel electro - phoresis ( PAGE ) and analyzed by autoradiography and Western blotting . ( D ) LIMK1 phosphorylates Slingshot - 1L ( SSH1L ) . 293T cells were transfected with SSH1L ( CS ) only or cotransfected with HA - LIMK1 ( WT ) or its mutants ( TEE , TV or DA ) . Reaction mixtures were resolved by SDS - PAGE and bands visualized by autoradiography . The relative kinase activities of SSH1L are presented as the mean 6 SD for triplicate experiments . Zhao et al 470 Volume 344 , Number 6 , December 2012 Phosphorylation of LIMK1 after A23187 treatment has similar kinetics to CAMKII phosphorylation . SSH - 1L is primarily phosphorylated on serine residues and its activity is negatively regulated by phosphorylation . 13 Our results show that SSH1L is phosphorylated by LIMK1 ( WT ) , ( TEE ) and ( T508A ) , but not LIMK1 ( DA ) . Knockdown of LIMK1 expression by RNA interference abolished the 1 m M A23187 - induced accumula - tion of SSH1L and F - actin , and 5 m M A23187 - induced accu - mulation of SSH1L and F - actin around the membrane periphery . Furthermore , coexpression of the CFP - LIMK1 ( WT ) and YFP - SSH1L caused accumulation of SSH1L and F - actin around the membrane periphery . However , expression of CFP - LIMK1 ( WT ) alone caused a marked increase in the induction of thick stress ﬁ bers . Together , these ﬁ ndings FIGURE 9 . LIM - kinase1 ( LIMK1 ) mediates subcellular localization of Slingshot - 1L ( SSH1L ) and F - actin . ( A ) Suppression of SSH1L LIMK1 by small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) . 293T cells were transfected with an LIMK1 siRNA plasmid ( pSUPER - LIMK1 ) , cultured for 24 hours and then serum starved for 16 hours . Expression of endogenous LIMK1 was analyzed by Western blotting with anti - LIMK1 antibodies . ( B ) Knock - down of LIMK1 expression by siRNA abolishes Ca 2 + - induced changes at the membrane periphery . MCF7 cells were transfected and selected with 1 m g / mL puromycin . ( C ) LIMK1 mediates polymerization of actin and accumulation of SSH1L to the membrane periphery . MCF7 cells were transfected with plasmids for YFP - SSH1L and CFP - LMK1 . Localization of exogenously expressed proteins was visualized by CFP or YFP ﬂuorescence and F - actin was stained with rhodamine - phalloidin . Images were obtained by using a laser scanning confocal microscope . FIGURE 10 . The roles of calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII ) and calcineurin ( Cn ) in Ca2 + - induced changes in coﬁlin activity and actin cytoskeleton reor - ganization . CaMKII is activated in unstimulated cells . Exposure of the cell to calcium ionophore further increases CaMKII activity , which , in turn , activates LIM - kinase1 ( LIMK1 ) and inactivates Cn and SSH - 1L by phosphorylation . The calcium signaling also induces the activation of Cn , which activates SSH - 1L and inactivates CaMKII by dephosphorylation . Thus , the interplay of CaMKII and Cn seems to be modulated by the levels of Ca 2 + and regulates Ca 2 + - induced changes in coﬁlin activity and actin cytoskeleton reorganization . Regulation of Coﬁlin Activity (cid:1) 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 471 suggest that the mechanism that balances CaMKII / Cn and LIMK1 / SSH1L activities also control co ﬁ lin activity and actin cytoskeletal reorganization . Although a variety of extracellular stimuli induce co ﬁ lin dephosphorylation , the signaling pathways that lead to co ﬁ lin dephosphorylation have not been well understood . Here we have further delineated this signaling pathway and shown that Ca 2 + levels control recruitment of co ﬁ lin and SSH1L to the membrane periphery .
