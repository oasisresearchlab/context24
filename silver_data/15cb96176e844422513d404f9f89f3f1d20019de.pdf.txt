Although structurally and functionally varied , adhesion complexes overlap substantially in their compo - sition , sharing a 60 - protein consensus adhesome 4 . As one of the most abundant consensus adhesome proteins , talin - 1 is viewed as an indispensable contributor to integrin activation 5 and adhesion complex organization 6 . Adaptor proteins that couple integrins to F - actin , such as vinculin and paxillin , are also universally associated with adhesion complexes , reflecting the pivotal role of F - actin in adhesion complex function 7 . Cell – ECM adhesion is also critical for mitotic progression and for the transmission of spatial memory between generations 8 – 11 , a key factor controlling differentiation and tissue development 12 . Paradoxically , the importance of cell – ECM attachment during mitosis conflicts with the observed disassembly of classical adhe - sion complexes at mitotic onset 13 , because failure of adhesion complex disassembly perturbs division 14 , 15 . Furthermore , integrins implicated in mitotic adhesion , such as β 1 , function not at the adhe - sion plane but in the detached cell cortex 16 . Overall , the nature of mitotic adhesion complexes remains profoundly unclear 17 , 18 . Here , we identify a class of ‘reticular’ adhesion complex with a unique adhesome , formed by integrin α V β 5 during interphase in the absence of both talin and F - actin . Reticular adhesions persist throughout mitosis , providing the ECM anchoring that is necessary for efficient division . Thus , reticular adhesions provide a solution to the paradox of mitotic cell – ECM attachment . Results α V β 5 is the predominant integrin used by cells in long - term culture . The integrin consensus adhesome was derived from cells plated on fibronectin 4 , 19 . To study the adhesome of cells that had assembled their own ECM , we performed mass spectrometry ( MS ) analysis of adhesion complex composition in U2OS cells following 72 h of growth . Unexpectedly , the most abundant integrin subunits identified were α V and β 5 , with much lower levels of β 1 , β 3 , β 8 , α 5 and α 3 ( Fig . 1a ) . Subsequent immunofluorescence analysis con - firmed that very distinct α V β 5 - positive adhesion complexes were visible in a range of cells in long - term culture , with little α V β 3 or β 1 labelling detected in U2OS , A549 and A375 cells ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Notably , α V β 5 was simultaneously detected in classical focal adhesions at the cell periphery and in reticular structures across the cell body , also visible after 24 and 48 h of cell growth ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . U2OS cells were then plated on the integrin α V ligand vitronectin . Confocal imaging showed β 5 associated with two different structures following 3 h of spreading : peripheral focal adhesion complexes containing talin and vinculin , and centrally distributed , punctate or reticular structures lacking these components ( Fig . 1c , d ) . Subsequently , similar α V β 5 - positive , talin - negative structures were detected in each of nine cell lines assessed , including the cancer cell lines CS1 - b5 , HeLa , MCF7 and BT549 ( Supplementary Reticular adhesions are a distinct class of cell - matrix adhesions that mediate attachment during mitosis John G .

Humphries 3 and Staffan Strömblad 2 * Adhesion to the extracellular matrix persists during mitosis in most cell types . However , while classical adhesion complexes , such as focal adhesions , do and must disassemble to enable mitotic rounding , the mechanisms of residual mitotic cell – extracel - lular matrix adhesion remain undefined . Here , we identify ‘reticular adhesions’ , a class of adhesion complex that is mediated by integrin α v β 5 , formed during interphase , and preserved at cell – extracellular matrix attachment sites throughout cell divi - sion . Consistent with this role , integrin β 5 depletion perturbs mitosis and disrupts spatial memory transmission between cell generations . Reticular adhesions are morphologically and dynamically distinct from classical focal adhesions . Mass spectrom - etry defines their unique composition , enriched in phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) - binding proteins but lacking virtually all consensus adhesome components . Indeed , reticular adhesions are promoted by PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and form independently of talin and F - actin . The distinct characteristics of reticular adhesions provide a solution to the problem of main - taining cell – extracellular matrix attachment during mitotic rounding and division .

Integrin α V and β 5 subunits co - localized ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) , but co - labelling of β 5 with antibodies against various adhesion complex - related proteins , including consensus adhesome com - ponents , α V β 5 binding partners , cytoskeletal proteins ( including F - actin ) and phosphotyrosine , revealed no specific co - localization ( Supplementary Figs . 1c and 2b – m ) . Integrin β 5 labelling inten - sity in both talin - 1 - positive and - negative structures correlated with vitronectin concentrations ( Fig . 1E - G ) , while U2OS cells plated on laminin ( not a ligand for α V β 5 ) only formed vinculin - positive adhesion complexes ( Supplementary Fig . 2n ) . In conclu - sion , formation of the reticular structures depends on α V β 5 – ECM ligand binding . We next labelled the integrin β 5 extracellular domain without prior cell permeabilization ( Supplementary Fig . 2o ) . Strong co - localisation with integrin β 5 - 2GFP demonstrated α V β 5 plasma membrane embedding and antibody specificity . Moreover , total internal reflection ( TIRF ) imaging of live U2OS cells co - expressing β 5 - 2GFP and mCherry - vinculin ( U2OS - β 5V ) revealed central , α V β 5 - positive , vinculin - negative structures in the TIRF plane ( Fig . 1h ) . Dark intracellular regions in mCherry - vinculin signals indicated where tensioned ventral membranes arced out of the TIRF plane , leaving no cytoplasmic signal . These dark regions cor - responded to large gaps between α V β 5 - positive , vinculin - negative puncta , suggesting the latter to be attachment points that pin the ventral plasma membrane to the substrate . This hypothesis was supported by live cell interference reflection microscopy , where close cell – substrate proximity corresponded precisely with integ - rin β 5 - 2GFP signals in both vinculin - positive FAs and vinculin - negative structures ( Fig . 1i ) . Collectively , these data indicate that α V β 5 - positive , consensus adhesome component - negative reticular structures are bona fide cell – ECM adhesion complexes . These are hereafter termed ‘reticular adhesions’ . Reticular and focal adhesion complexes are morphologically and dynamically distinct . Reticular adhesions were more numer - ous than classical focal adhesion complexes at all sizes ( Fig . 2a ) , increased in size more frequently ( Fig . 2b ) and were localized further from the cell periphery ( Fig . 2c ) . There was no correla - tion between RA size and integrin β 5 clustering density , unlike the increased integrin density observed in larger FAs ( Fig . 2d ) 20 , 21 . This implies molecular - scale differences between the maturation of focal and reticular adhesions , with the latter being more homogenous . Reticular adhesions formed as small puncta , grew by net periph - eral integrin recruitment , producing ring - like or reticular structures that ultimately fragmented and disassembled , all without recruit - ing vinculin ( Fig . 2e – h , Supplementary Movie 1 and cropped region from Fig . 2h in Supplementary Movie 2 ) . Thus , reticular adhesions form de novo as a distinct class of adhesion complex . Quantitative tracking highlighted stark differences in dynam - ics between reticular adhesions and focal adhesions ( Fig . 2i – n and Supplementary Movie 3 ) : isotropic reticular adhesion growth pro - duced low displacement ( Fig . 2j ) , whereas focal adhesions elongated anisotropically and slid at high velocities , reflecting F - actin - derived forces driving asymmetric component recruitment ( Fig . 2k ) 22 , 23 . Isotropic growth and immobility in reticular adhesions suggests the absence of such directed mechanical cues 24 and complements the observed lack of F - actin . This conclusion was supported by locally disordered motion of reticular adhesion trajectories ( Fig . 2l ) . In contrast , focal adhesions moved co - linearly within dif - ferent cell lobes ( Fig . 2m ) , reflecting aligned , centripetal F - actin - derived forces 25 . The relationship between average adhesion complex velocity and lifetime revealed that , for both focal adhesions and reticular adhesions , fast movement corresponded to short life - time . Thus , fast - moving focal adhesions existed for less than half the lifespan of reticular adhesions , which were relatively static and long - lived ( Fig . 2n ) . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis revealed that , despite their increased lifetime as complexes , β 5 - 2GFP turn - over in reticular adhesions was faster and more extensive than in focal adhesions ( Fig . 3a – e and Supplementary Movie 4 ) . Conversely , variability in β 5 - 2GFP fluorescence recovery was lower in reticular adhesions ( Fig . 3f ) , suggesting relative homogeneity in molecular organization and dynamics across their lifespan , consistent with the homogeneity in integrin clustering densities ( Fig . 2d ) . In stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM ) , both adhesion complex types displayed small internal clusters of integ - rin β 5 ( Fig . 3g ) , consistent with the integrin β 1 nanocluster orga - nization within adhesion complexes that we recently reported 26 . Minimal differences were observed between the adhesion complex types in terms of nearest - neighbour distances between nanoclusters and molecular localization counts per nanocluster ( Fig . 3h , i ) . Thus , despite the absence of consensus adhesome components ( including talin - 1 , thought to control nanoscale integrin organization 6 ) and differences in macromolecular dynamics , the molecular - scale orga - nization of integrin β 5 is virtually identical in focal adhesions and reticular adhesions . Reticular adhesions mediate cell attachment but form indepen - dently of F - actin and talin . Disruption of actin polymerization by cytochalasin D or latrunculin A before cell – ECM attachment inhibited focal adhesion , but not reticular adhesion , formation ( Fig . 4a , b , Supplementary Fig . 3a and Supplementary Movie 5 ; note the simultaneous formation of both reticular adhesions and focal adhesions within 20 – 30 min of control cell attachment ) . Cytochalasin D inhibited cell spreading , but not reticular adhe - sion numbers relative to cell area , as evidenced by matched lin - ear trends in cell area versus adhesion complex number within treated and control cells ( Fig . 4c ) . Notably , while cytochalasin D substantially reduced vinculin levels in surviving focal adhe - sions , β 5 density increased in reticular adhesions ( Fig . 4d ) . Furthermore , cytochalasin D treatment after attachment caused disassembly of focal adhesions , but retention of reticular adhe - sions ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . Integrin β 3 - and β 5 - negative CS1 - wt cells did not attach to vit - ronectin , while CS1 cells stably expressing β 5 ( CS1 - β 5 ) attached strongly ( Fig . 4e and Supplementary Fig . 3b ) and formed both focal and reticular adhesions . CS1 - β 5 cells treated with cytochalasin D attached approximately half as strongly as unperturbed CS1 - β 5 cells , demonstrating that reticular adhesions facilitate cell attach - ment in the absence of F - actin . This residual adhesion was blocked by competitive inhibition of α V β 5 - VN ( vitronectin ) binding using cyclic RGD ( Arg - Gly - Asp ) peptides , confirming α V β 5 specific - ity ( Fig . 4e ) . Thus , reticular adhesions forming in the absence of F - actin facilitate attachment in the absence of focal adhesions . To assess the role of talin in reticular adhesion formation , talin - 1 - null mouse embryonic stem cells ( mES talin - 1 – / – ) were trans - fected with talin - 2 siRNA . Reduction of talin limited cell spreading ( Fig . 4f – h and Supplementary Fig . 3c ) 27 and ablated focal adhe - sions ( Fig . 4f , g ) ; however , integrin β 5 was more densely concen - trated within reticular adhesions following talin - 2 knockdown ( Fig . 4f , g , i ) , similar to cells treated with cytochalasin D ( Fig . 4a – d ) . Thus , reticular adhesions can form independently of talin . On acti - vation by manganese or the talin - 1 head domain , integrin α V β 3 forms reticular - like clusters in the centre of the cell 28 , 29 . In contrast , α V β 5 clustered independently of talin or additional activation stim - uli . Furthermore , mRFP - tagged talin - 1 head or rod domains nei - ther localized to reticular adhesions nor altered α V β 5 - containing NAtuRe CeLL BiOLOGy | VOL 20 | NOVEMBER 2018 | 1290 – 1302 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 1292 Articles NATuRe Cell BIology reticular adhesions ( Supplementary Fig . 3d ) .

NAtuRe CeLL BiOLOGy | VOL 20 | NOVEMBER 2018 | 1290 – 1302 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 1293 Articles NATuRe Cell BIology Reticular adhesion composition is unique . We next used MS to define reticular adhesion composition . U2OS cells were treated with cytochalasin D to deplete focal adhesions , followed by ventral membrane adhesion complex isolation and pro - cessing . A total of 199 proteins were identified in the control condition , 18 of which were consensus adhesome components ( Fig . 5a and Supplementary Table 2 ) 4 . Conversely , cytochalasin D - treated samples revealed 53 proteins selectively associated with reticular adhesions , only one of which was a consensus adhesome protein ( tensin - 3 ) . Four proteins were discounted from further analysis due to exceptionally high representation in the CRAPome database 30 , leaving a reticular adhesome of 49 proteins . Of these , 41 formed a highly connected protein – protein interaction network ( Fig . 5b ) . Lower diversity in the reticular adhesome supports evidence of relative homogene - ity in both integrin clustering density ( Fig . 2d ) and dynamics ( Fig . 3f ) . Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment of terms relating to membrane organization and endocytosis ( Fig . 5c , d ) , in contrast to the control condition that was enriched for terms related to cell adhesion and regulation of actin cytoskeleton ( Supplementary Fig . 4a , b ) . Ontology analysis was consistent with MS identification of a number of known endocytic adaptors in reticular adhesions ( Fig . 5b ) . Six candidates were validated by immunofluorescence , including NUMB , DAB2 ( Fig . 5e , f ) , EPS15L1 , HIP1R , WASL and ITSN1 ( Supplementary Fig . 4c – f ) . Despite the observation that reticular adhesions did not associ - ate with F - actin and formed following disruption of F - actin , a number of actin - binding proteins were identified in the reticu - lar adhesome and two of these ( tensin - 3 and talin - 2 ) co - local - ized with β 5 in cytochalasin - treated cells ( Fig . 5g , h ) . In contrast , the Arp2 / 3 complex component Arp3 did not localize with β 5 - positive structures ( Supplementary Fig . 4g ) and inhibition of Arp2 / 3 did not abrogate reticular adhesions , despite reducing focal adhesion intensity ( Supplementary Fig . 5a – c ) . m C he rr y v i n c u li n – p r e - b l ea c h I n t eg r i n β 5 2 G F P – p r e - b l ea c h I n t eg r i n β 5 2 G F P – po s t - b l ea c h I n t eg r i n β 5 2 G F P – po s t - r e c o v e r y I n t eg r i n β 5 – i n t en s i t y r e c o v e r y Focal Reticular d Pre - bleach Post - bleach Post - recovery Integrin β 5 2GFP a b c mCherry vinculin g Reticular : conv .

Correspondingly , depletion of PIK3C2A , which generates phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) from PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , caused a relative shift from focal to reticular adhe - sions . Depletion of targets that produce PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 reduced β 5 - 2GFP levels in both adhesion complex types ( Fig . 6c ) , yet , because the effects were more pronounced for reticular adhesions , the ratio to focal adhesions decreased . In contrast , PIK3C2A deple - tion perturbed only focal adhesions . Neomycin ( a PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding inhibitor ) reduced β 5 - 2GFP intensities in reticular adhe - sions while increasing intensities in focal adhesions ( Fig . 6d and Supplementary Fig . 6b ) . Conversely , LY294002 ( a PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 formation inhibitor ) increased reticular adhesion and reduced focal adhesion intensities . These findings indicate that focal and reticular adhesions are in equilibrium , with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 promoting reticu - lar adhesions and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 promoting focal adhesions . Reticular adhesions persist throughout division when focal adhesions disassemble . siRNA - mediated knockdown of integrin β 5 reduced cell proliferation ( Fig . 7a ) without affecting S - phase progression ( Fig . 7b ) . We therefore probed a potential role for β 5 in mitosis . Unlike classical adhesion complexes , reticular adhe - sions persisted throughout division ( Fig . 7c – i and Supplementary Movie 6 ) , remaining free of consensus adhesome components ( Supplementary Fig . 7a – e ) . In virtually all cells on purified lam - inin or fibronectin , where integrin β 1 is preferentially engaged ( Supplementary Fig . 7f , g ) , we detected no β 1 - labelled adhesion complexes during mitosis . β 1 - containing adhesion complexes were detected during mitosis only in normal human fibroblasts on fibro - nectin . In other cells , mitotic cells retained adhesion by cell – cell association . These results suggest a selective role for α V β 5 in mitotic cell attachment . The pre - mitotic footprint of the mother cell is transmitted with high precision to post - mitotic daughter cells ( Fig . 7c , d ) 31 , 32 . During the rounding phase of mitosis , this footprint was demarcated by membrane dye - labelled retraction fibres and integrin β 5 - 2GFP - labelled reticular adhesions ( Fig . 7c , f , g ) . The exquisite correspon - dence between retraction fibres ( Fig . 7h ) and reticular adhesions ( Fig . 7i ) was highlighted by 3D visualization of a similarly staged mitotic cell ( Fig . 7j – l and Supplementary Movie 7 ) . Here , retraction fibres angled down and attached precisely at sites decorated with β 5 - labelled reticular adhesions . A role for reticular adhesions in directing post - division cell spreading was also exemplified by live cell imaging ( Supplementary Movie 8 ) . Quantitative comparison of focal and reticular adhesions during division confirmed that the number and intensity of vinculin - positive focal adhesions fell to virtually zero during mitosis , while β 5 - positive reticular adhesion numbers and β 5 intensity were maintained ( Fig . 7m , n ) . As previ - ously reported , mitotic retraction fibres contain dense actin fila - ments ( Supplementary Fig . 7h , i and Supplementary Movie 9 ) . We detected weak F - actin signals in reticular adhesions at the tips of mitotic retraction fibres ( Supplementary Fig . 7h – k ) , with F - actin concentrations well below those within the retraction fibres , sug - gesting that reticular adhesions have limited coupling to F - actin fol - lowing mitotic cell rounding or that retraction fibres function via membrane tension and mediate adhesion independent of F - actin . Reticular adhesions are required for division and inter - gener - ational spatial memory transmission . A detailed comparison of reticular adhesion distributions before , during and after mitosis ( Fig . 8a – c and Supplementary Movie 10 ) indicated that the over - all geometry of central reticular adhesions remained virtually unchanged between generations , providing a potential mecha - nism for spatial memory storage . In contrast , peripheral reticular adhesions ( generally associated with mitotic retraction fibres ) underwent significant remodelling characterized by both narrow - ing and intensification of the complex ( Fig . 8d ) . Nanoscale STORM imaging confirmed that central mitotic reticular adhesions were indistinguishable in nano - organization from interphase reticular adhesions ( Fig . 3g – i versus Fig . 8d – f ) , while peripheral mitotic retraction fibre - associated reticular adhesions were linearized and condensed . This was confirmed by quantification of nanocluster nearest - neighbour distances and molecular localization counts per nanocluster ( Fig . 8e , f ) . Such molecular - scale remodelling function - ally implicates reticular adhesions in the mechanical process of cell – ECM attachment during division . Many cells exhibit a preference to divide along the major axis of the pre - mitotic mother cell , thus determining the spatial arrange - ment of daughter cells 8 – 11 . We therefore measured the residual angle between the pre - mitotic major axis and the mitotic division axis in HeLa cells ( Fig . 8g , h ) , chosen for their expression of reticular adhe - sions ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) and their extensive mitotic char - acterization 33 . Residual angle distributions were skewed towards zero ( indicating spatial memory retention ) in control cells and β 5 - rescued cells . By contrast , mitotic axis orientation in integrin - β 5 - depleted cells was almost random relative to the pre - mitotic major axis , indicating a loss of spatial memory . Thus , reticular adhesions are required for intergenerational spatial memory transmission during division . Only 20 % of β 5 - depleted cells underwent normal division , ver - sus 75 % for controls ( Fig . 8i ) . A range of defects were observed in β 5 - depleted cells , including delayed mitosis ( often with incomplete cytokinesis ) , repeated cell rounding and re - spreading without divi - sion , and failure of cytokinesis resulting in binucleate daughter cells ( Supplementary Fig . 8a , b and Supplementary Movies 11 – 14 ) . The frequency of these errors 34 was reduced by β 5 - EGFP rescue ( Fig . 8i , Supplementary Fig . 8c , d and Supplementary Movie 15 ) . Together , these findings demonstrate that integrin β 5 - mediated reticular adhe - sions are essential for normal progression of division in HeLa cells . Discussion Here , we report the identification and characterization of a previ - ously unrecognized cellular structure , the reticular adhesion , an adhesion complex mediating cell – ECM attachment during mito - sis . Reticular adhesions form in a diverse array of cell types and are characterized by both the presence of integrin α V β 5 and the absence of consensus adhesome components . Furthermore , in con - trast to focal adhesions , reticular adhesions can form independently of F - actin and talin . Reticular adhesions persist throughout mitosis and provide a solution to the paradox of mitotic cell – ECM adhesion , which endures despite the absence of all previously known adhesion com - plexes 13 , 15 , 18 . Cell – ECM attachment is essential for spatial memory transmission between cell generations , including defining the axis of division 8 – 11 and facilitating cytokinesis 35 – 37 . So far , it has been unclear how residual adhesion is maintained during mitosis , how mitotic retraction fibres 38 are tethered to the substratum , and how re - spreading is guided thereafter . Reticular adhesions now pro - vide mechanisms underpinning all these phenomena . The unique characteristics of reticular adhesions appear suited to these roles in division . For instance , F - actin independence decouples reticu - lar adhesions from large - scale cytoskeletal remodelling during cell rounding , while the ability to interact with membrane retraction fibres is maintained . This key role for reticular adhesions in division is confirmed by integrin β 5 depletion , which causes multiple mitotic defects and disturbed spatial memory transmission . While we find an important role for α V β 5 during division , cells can also proliferate on ECM ligands not engaging α V β 5 . This implies that cells can deploy alternative adhesion receptors for mitotic anchorage . For example , integrin α 6 β 4 - positive hemides - NAtuRe CeLL BiOLOGy | VOL 20 | NOVEMBER 2018 | 1290 – 1302 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 1298 Articles NATuRe Cell BIology c d e g f h i – 120 min 0 min + 120 min – 120 min 0 min + 120 min – 120 min 0 min + 120 min M e m b r ane d y e m C he rr y v i n c u l i n I n t eg r i n β 5 2 G F P a j k l b m n – 20 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 – 170 – 150 – 130 – 110 – 90 – 70 – 50 – 30 – 10 10 30 50 70 90 110 130 150 170 – 170 – 150 – 130 – 110 – 90 – 70 – 50 – 30 – 10 10 30 50 70 90 110 130 150 170 Vinculin Vinculin Integrin β 5 Integrin β 5 P e r c en t o f m a x i m a l A C nu m be r pe r c e ll – 20 0 20 – 20 40 60 80 100 120 P e r c en t o f m ean A C i n t en s i t y pe r c e ll Time relative to mitotic event ( min ) Time relative to mitotic event ( min ) R e l a t i v e c e ll nu m be r Days 0 1 23 0 2 4 6 Control β 5 KD P = 0 . 1739 P = 0 . 0243 P = 1 . 06 × 10 – 5 Control β 5 KD 0 20 40 60 80 100 P e r c en t E DU po s i t i v e c e ll s P = 0 . 5337 Fig . 7 | Reticular adhesions persist during mitosis and transmit spatial memory from pre - mitotic to post - mitotic daughter cells . a , b , Proliferation of control or integrin β 5 knockdown U2OS cells over 3 days post attachment : mean ± s . d . of n = 14 replicates across three biologically independent experiments ; P values reflect two - sided unpaired t - testing relative to day zero ( a ) ; percentage of EdU - positive cells 3 days post attachment for n = 26 fields of view containing 55 – 217 cells each across three biologically independent experiments , with distribution of individual values in blue rings ( b ) .

These β 1 integrin clusters differ from reticular adhesions because they are remnants of disassembled focal adhesions , while reticular adhesions represent a distinct adhesion complex population during both interphase and mitosis . Nonetheless , investigation of mitotic adhesion roles for alternative integrins , and their relationship to reticular adhesions , is now merited . The limited phenotype of β 5 knockout mice suggests redundancy of function among adhesion receptors and / or a specialized role for α V β 5 in regulating division within specific ECM environments .

NAtuRe CeLL BiOLOGy | VOL 20 | NOVEMBER 2018 | 1290 – 1302 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 1300 Articles NATuRe Cell BIology is expressed at high levels in a number of proliferative diseases , this raises the possibility that it promotes disease progression by enhancing division within specific ECM environments . It is now important to determine the role of α V β 5 and reticular adhesions in vivo , within physiological and disease settings . In this context , a focal adhesion - independent role for α v β 5 in three - dimensional skin formation and tumour invasion has been reported 44 . Remarkably , reticular adhesions have remained uncharacterized , although early studies reported similar reticular α v β 5 labelling pat - terns in cells spread on vitronectin 45 . The experimental induction of morphologically comparable structures , such as through manga - nese - or talin - head - mediated activation of α V β 3 ( refs 28 , 29 ) , suggests the potential for other integrins to form similar structures given modulation of their activity state . Reticular adhesions lack not only F - actin , but virtually all consensus adhesome components . Most notably , both talin - 1 and kindlin are absent , despite being consid - ered necessary and ubiquitous integrin activators 46 . Moreover , per - turbations of talin and F - actin indicate that reticular adhesions can form independently of these proteins . Proteomic analysis of reticular adhesions identified a distinct adhesome , highly enriched in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding proteins . These include clathrin - mediated endocytosis adaptors , such as Dab2 and Numb , previously shown to interact directly with the integrin β 5 cytoplasmic tail in vitro 47 . These data are consistent with recent evidence of integrin - mediated ECM attachment via clathrin - coated structures 48 , 49 . Indeed , integrin β 5 can localize within clath - rin plaques 48 , 50 – 52 that are postulated to associate with areas of strong adhesion 34 , 53 – 56 . It will be important to determine whether reticular adhesions associate with clathrin lattices to facilitate this adhesion and whether clathrin structures remain associated with the substra - tum during mitosis . Given that both reticular adhesions and clath - rin - coated structures can form in the absence of talin , it follows that some integrins may not depend on talin for their activation 49 . In this context , it is also notable that we observe near identical nanoscale integrin β 5 clustering between talin - 1 - positive and - negative adhe - sion complexes during interphase , despite previous suggestions that talin - 1 determines nanoscale integrin organization 6 . Thus , both in terms of integrin activation and organization , it is possible that either alternative proteins can replace talin - 1 functions in reticular adhesions , or that β 5 ligand - binding and nanoscale organization are independent of cytosolic regulators . Regardless , the composition , regulation and function of integrin - mediated adhesion complexes appear more diverse than previously recognized . In conclusion , we have defined reticular adhesions , an over - looked cellular structure and adhesion complex class . Functionally , by mediating cell – ECM attachment during mitosis , reticular adhe - sions provide a distinctive solution to the paradox of mitotic cell attachment , where classical adhesion complexes must disassemble but cells must also remain adherent . These discoveries not only delineate a specific form of adhesion complex , but also highlight areas of adhesion biology that merit further attention , including the integrins and adhesion complexes employed in vivo .

Membranes were probed with anti - talin - 2 mouse monoclonal ( 68E7 ; Abcam ) at 1 : 500 dilution , anti - α - tubulin ( DM1A ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) at 1 : 500 dilution , or anti - integrin β 5 ( 4708S ; Cell Signalling Technology ) at 1 : 1 , 000 dilution . Proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ) reagent ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . Imaging . Live - and fixed - cell imaging was primarily performed using either a Nikon Ti2 - mounted A1R confocal microscope running NIS elements software ( Nikon ) with a PlanApo VC × 60 / 1 . 4 numerical aperture ( NA ) oil - immersion objective or a Leica TCS SP5 acousto - optical beamsplitter confocal microscope using a × 63 objective ( HCX Plan Apochromat , NA 1 . 25 ) and LCS software ( Leica ) . Live fluorescence imaging during cell division was carried out with a Yokagoawa CSU - X1 spinning - disk confocal and Andor electron - multiplying charge - coupled device ( EM - CCD ) . TIRF imaging employed a Nikon Ti2 inverted microscope configured for minimal ( ~ 90 nm ) evanescence wave penetration . Live - cell imaging intervals were 0 . 5 – 5 min over 1 – 8 h with pixel resolutions between 0 . 13 and 0 . 21 µ m . Live cells were maintained in normal culture medium , absent FCS / FBS ( fetal calf serum / fetal bovine serum ) , at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . Live cell interference reflection microscopy ( IRM ) made use of a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope and Plan - Apochromat × 63 / 1 . 4 NA oil objective , with post - sample dichroic mirror displacement allowing reflected laser light ( 561 nm ) detection . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) analyses were performed via confocal microscopy and analysed as described previously 60 . Briefly , three sequential images were acquired of integrin β 5 - 2GFP and mCherry - vinculin in U2OS - β 5V cells before bleaching , enabling robust recovery standardization . Both reticular and focal adhesions ( 2 – 3 each per cell ) were then bleached using 35 % of maximal 488 nm laser power over 40 rapid iterations ( < 3 s per cell ) . Recovery was monitored for a total of 1 , 875 s , with intervals of 6 s for the first 120 s and intervals of 45 s thereafter . STORM was performed in U2OS cells fixed during either interphase or mitosis . Cells were labelled using rabbit polyclonal anti - integrin β 5 antibody ( ab15459 ) and with Alexa 405 – Alexa 647 double - labelled secondary . Secondary antibodies ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) were labelled in house , as previously described 61 . A Nikon N - STORM system with Apo internal reflection fluorescence × 100 / 1 . 49 NA objective was used , with images acquired using an EM - CCD camera . Before STORM imaging , TIRF images of integrin β 5 and mCherry - vinculin were acquired , enabling diffraction - limited definition of reticular and focal adhesions using the criteria detailed in the section ‘Image analysis’ . Thereafter , 647 nm laser light excited Alexa 647 , with 405 nm light used for reactivation . Standard STORM imaging buffer was used , containing 100 mM Cysteamine MEA , 0 . 5 mg ml − 1 glucose oxidase , 40 µ g ml − 1 catalase and 5 % glucose ( all Sigma - Aldrich ) . Image analysis . Patch Morphology Analysis Dynamic software ( Digital Cell Imaging Laboratories ) was used for analysis of static ( fixed ) and dynamic ( live ) cell imaging data , except where otherwise specified . Analysis strategy and parameterization were as described previously 20 , 21 , 59 , 62 . Briefly , both cells and intracellular adhesion cohorts were segmented according to pixel intensity gradient analysis . A variety of morphological , pixel intensity and dynamic properties were then extracted for each cell and for each adhesion 21 . Relationships between each adhesion and its ( parent ) cell were maintained . Minimal adhesion size was set to 0 . 3 µ m 2 . For live cell data , adhesion tracking parameters included linear motion interpolation over a maximum of one missing time point , 3 µ m maximum adhesion step size per time point and four time point minimum track lifetime . When quantifying differences between reticular and focal adhesions , we used the absence or presence ( respectively ) of canonical adhesome components as a defining indicator . Specifically , we applied a threshold such that segmented adhesions ( delineated by integrin β 5 ) were defined as reticular if they contained less than the mean of background fluorescence values ( pixel intensities inside the cell boundary but outside segmented adhesions ) plus two standard deviations for a canonical adhesion marker ( vinculin or talin ) . Integrin β 5 - positive adhesions with greater than this value of fluorescence ( for the canonical adhesion marker ) were classed as focal adhesions . For FRAP analyses , PAD software was used to segment integrin β 5 - 2GFP - positive adhesions found in the last ( third ) pre - bleach image frame . Focal and reticular adhesions were distinguished based on mCherry - vinculin content , as described above . Identical adhesion boundaries ( from pre - bleach frame 3 ) were then used as fluorescence recovery measurement locations for all subsequent image NAtuRe CeLL BiOLOGy | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATuRe Cell BIology frames . Adhesions judged to move during this period were excluded from further analysis . Integrin β 5 - 2GFP fluorescence recovery curves were first standardized relative to intensity fluctuations ( including non - specific photobleaching ) in non - bleached areas of the cell . Thereafter , intensity values in bleached regions were standardized per adhesion as a percentage of the mean of the three pre - bleached images . The standard deviation of percentage recovery , per time point , was also recorded . Recovery curves are displayed as mean per time point ( circles ) ± 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ; per time point ) . Loess regression defined a smoothed fit ( line ) ± a moving 95 % CI envelope . Statistical differences between Loess fitted curves were assessed via two - sided Kolmogorov – Smirnov testing . STORM data were analysed using Insight3 software ( developed by Bo Huang , University of California ) . Localization coordinates were first precisely defined via Gaussian fitting . Next , reticular and focal adhesions were segmented and defined using conventional TIRF images of integrin β 5 and vinculin , based on the thresholding criteria detailed above . Clustering was then performed on integrin β 5 localizations within each adhesion type , revealing coordinate position and localization counts for integrin nanoclusters found within each adhesion . DBSCAN was used for clustering 63 , with epsilon ( search radius ) set to 10 nm and minimum points ( within epsilon radius ) set to 3 . Nearest - neighbour distances between nanoclusters and localization numbers per cluster were assessed for each adhesion type using R . Three - dimensional rendering and animation of confocal images was performed using NIS elements software . Additional supplementary movies were prepared in FiJi software 64 . MS analysis of the reticular adhesome . Four 10 - cm - diameter dishes per condition of U2OS cells were cultured for 48 h to 90 % confluency then treated with either DMSO or 20 µ M cytochalasin D ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 2 h . To isolate adhesion complexes , cells were incubated with the membrane - permeable crosslinker dimethyl - 3 , 3 ′ - dithiobispropionimidate ( DTBP , Sigma - Aldrich ; 6 mM , 5 min ) . DTBP was then quenched using 1 M Tris ( pH 8 . 5 , 2 min ) , after which cells were again washed once using PBS and incubated in PBS at 4 °C . Cell bodies were then removed by a combination of cell lysis in RIPA buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 5 mM EDTA , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % ( wt / vol ) TX - 100 , 1 % ( wt / vol ) sodium deoxycholate ( DOC ) , 0 . 5 % ( wt / vol ) SDS ; 3 min ) and a high - pressure water wash ( 10 s ) . Protein complexes left bound to the tissue culture dish were washed twice using PBS , recovered by scraping in 200 µ l recovery solution ( 125 mM Tris - HCl , pH 6 . 8 , 1 % ( wt / vol ) SDS , 15 mM dithiothreitol ) , and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min . Each sample was subsequently precipitated from solution by addition of four volumes of − 20 °C acetone , incubated for 16 h at − 80 °C , and resuspended in reducing sample buffer . For MS , samples were separated by SDS – PAGE on a 4 – 12 % SDS Bis - Tris gel ( Thermo Fisher ) , stained for 10 min with Instant Blue ( Expedeon ) , and washed in water overnight at 4 °C . Gel pieces were excised and processed by in - gel tryptic digestion as previously described 4 . Peptides were analysed by liquid chromatography ( LC ) – tandem MS ( MS / MS ) using an UltiMate 3000 Rapid Separation LC ( RSLC , Dionex Corporation ) coupled to an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher ) . Peptides were separated on a bridged ethyl hybrid C18 analytical column ( 250 mm × 75 μ m inner diameter , 1 . 7 μ m particle size , Waters ) over a 1 h gradient from 8 to 33 % ( vol / vol ) ACN in 0 . 1 % ( vol / vol ) FA . LC – MS / MS analyses were operated in data - dependent mode to automatically select peptides for fragmentation by collision - induced dissociation ( CID ) . Quantification was performed using Progenesis LC – MS software ( Progenesis QI , Nonlinear Dynamics ; http : / / www . nonlinear . com / progenesis / qi - for - proteomics / ) . In brief , automatic alignment was used , and the resulting aggregate spectrum filtered to include + 1 , + 2 and + 3 charge states only . A . mgf file representing the aggregate spectrum was exported and searched using Mascot ( one missed cleavage , fixed modification : carbamidomethyl [ C ] ; variable modifications : oxidation [ M ] ; peptide tolerance : ± 5 ppm ; MS / MS tolerance : ± 0 . 5 Da ) , and the resulting . xml file was re - imported to assign peptides to features . Three separate experiments were performed , and abundance values for proteins identified in the analysis were used to determine which proteins were enriched over twofold following treatment with cytochalasin D . Although 53 proteins were detected in the original MS data , four were excluded from further analysis due to their high representation in the CRAPome database 30 . The putative reticular adhesome interaction network was constructed using the online STRING protein – protein interaction database ( v . 10 ) 65 including experimentally validated interactions only , with a ‘medium’ interaction confidence score ( > 0 . 4 ) . Even at higher confidence ( interaction confidence score > 0 . 7 ) , this interaction network is dense : 91 known interactions relative to 11 randomly expected ( based on proteome - wide interaction frequencies ) . Biological process - and KEGG pathway - enrichment analyses were performed using the DAVID Bioinformatics resource 66 . PIP regulator siRNA screening and drug - based perturbation of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and Arp2 / 3 . U2OS - β 5V cells were treated with pooled siRNAs ( four siRNAs per target ; ON - TARGET SMART Pool plus ; Dharmacon ) via reverse transfection in the inner 60 wells of 96 - well optical glass plates . Each plate contained five negative ( untreated , mock transfected and three non - targeting siRNA controls ) and three positive targeting controls ( against EGFP , integrin α v or integrin β 5 ) . The primary screen was repeated twice , with a secondary validation assay using four siRNAs individually per target ( Dharmacon ) also repeated twice . siRNA sequences are presented in Supplementary Table 5 . To prepare the siRNA library , 1 μ l of each siRNA pool from 2 μ M stock was mixed with 30 μ l nuclease - free water and added to 96 - well glass - bottomed - plate wells , before drying at room temperature . For reverse transfection , 30 µ l of RNAiMAX was first added to 9 ml of Opti - MEM ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Then , 30 µ l of this mixture was added to each well , followed by 30 min incubation . U2OS - β 5V cells ( 90 % confluent ) grown in 75 cm 2 flasks were trypsinized and resuspended with 30 ml of growth medium . A 100 µ l volume of the resulting cell suspension was added to each well and pipetted five times to disperse cells . The final siRNA concentration was 15 nM . Cells were incubated for 48 h before fixation with 4 % PFA ( 15 min ) and subsequent permeabilization with 0 . 2 % TX - 100 in PBS . Finally , cells were incubated for 1 h with DAPI and Alexa 647 - conjugated phalloidin before PBS washing three times . Cells were imaged with a Nikon A1R confocal microscope with a PlanApo VC 60X / 1 . 4 NA oil - immersion objective . Image settings were identical for all samples and repeats . Montage images were acquired and stitched in NIS elements software , enabling high - resolution acquisition of ~ 100 cells and ~ 5 , 000 adhesions per condition per experimental repeat . Image data were quantified and analysed using KNIME software . Individual cells were segmented using Voronoi tessellation based on DAPI ( nuclei ) and phalloidin ( cell body ) staining . Integrin β 5 - positive adhesions were then segmented and split using spot detection and the Wählby method 67 , respectively . Focal and reticular adhesions were defined based on mCherry - vinculin content as described above . Background - corrected intensity values were extracted per channel , for each adhesion , per cell . Mean integrin β 5 intensity values in reticular adhesions were divided by values in focal adhesions to generate the relative intensity ratio . All values were Z - score standardized using robust statistics ( median and median absolute deviation ) relative to the combination of ( three ) non - targeting siRNA controls per 96 - well plate . Resulting response distributions were plotted using R and RStudio software . U2OS - β 5V cells cultured and plated as described above , including 48 h incubation in 96 - well optical glass plates , were treated for 30 min with DMSO ( control ) , 10 mM neomycin ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding inhibition ) or 25 μ M LY294002 ( inhibition of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 generation ) . For treatment with Arp2 / 3 inhibitor , U2OS cells plated onto glass coverslips and cultured for 48 h were treated for 2 h with 50 μ M CK - 666 ( Arp2 / 3 inhibitor ) or 50 μ M CK - 689 ( Arp2 / 3 inhibitor control ; inactive analogue of CK - 666 ) . Cells were then fixed , permeabilized and labelled as described above . Imaging and analysis were again performed using KNIME , as described above for siRNA screening . Talin knockdown and response analysis . Talin - 1 - null mouse embryonic stem cells ( mES talin 1 – / – ; gift from D . Critchley , University of Leicester ) were transfected using RNAiMAX ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using either non - targeting control siRNA ( ON - TARGETplus non - targeting control ; 5 ′ - UGGUUUACAUGUCGACUAA - 3 ′ ) or talin - 2 - specific siRNAs designated talin - 2 siRNA1 ( 5 ′ - GCAGAAUGCUAUUAAGAAAUU - 3 ′ ) , talin - 2 siRNA2 ( 5 ′ - CCGCAAAGCUCUUGGCUGAUU - 3 ′ ) or talin - 2 siRNA3 ( 5 ′ - AAGUCAGUAUUACGUUGUUUU - 3 ′ ) . siRNAs were synthesized by GenePharma . Cells were incubated for 48 h then plated for 3 h on 10 µ g ml − 1 vitronectin . Fixation and permeabilization conditions were tuned to retain cytoplasmic talin - 2 , as described previously 59 . Briefly , labelling was performed using liquid - handling robotics ( Freedom EVO , Tecan ) to reduce experimental variability . Cells were fixed with 2 % PFA for 10 min , washed with PBS , and permeabilized using 0 . 1 % TX - 100 for 5 min at room temperature . Cells were then blocked for 15 min with 1 % PBS / BSA . Immuno - labelling followed at room temperature for 30 min , targeting integrin β 5 ( polyclonal Ab ; ab15459 , Abcam ) and talin ( pan - talin mouse monoclonal Ab ‘53 . 8’ , BioRad ) or anti - talin - 2 mouse monoclonal Ab ‘68E7’ ( Abcam ) . After 1 % PBS / BSA washing , Alexa 488 and 647 secondary antibodies were applied , targeting rabbit and mouse primary antibodies , respectively . Images of integrin β 5 and residual talin - 2 were acquired with a Nikon A1R confocal and oil - immersion objective ( PlanApo VC × 60 / 1 . 4 NA ) . Image analysis was performed using PAD software to record residual talin ( mean ) intensities per cell , mean β 5 intensities per segmented adhesion ( per cell ) and cell area . Values were scaled as fold - change relative to control siRNA . A total of 20 – 40 cells were imaged per condition in each of four experimental repeats with talin - 2 siRNA1 , or single confirmatory experiments with talin - 2 siRNA2 and 3 . Immunoblotting was performed as described above . Integrin β 5 knockdown and mitotic analysis . siRNA used for knockdown of β 5 targeted the sequence 5 ′ - GGGAUGAGGUGAUCACAUG - 3 ′ and was obtained from Dharmacon . For rescue of β 5 expression , an siRNA - resistant WT β 5 - EGFP clone was generated using the QuickChange IIXL site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Agilent Technologies ) to introduce silent mutations in the siRNA target sequence . The primers were forward 5 ′ - AGCCTATGCAGGGACGAAGTTATTACCTGGGTGGACACC - 3 ′ and reverse 5 ′ - GGTGTCCACCCAGGTAATAACTTCGTCCCTGCATAGGCT - 3 ′ ( obtained from Eurofins Genomics ) . Cells were transfected simultaneously with either non - targeting or β 5 siRNA together with either EGFP alone ( pEGFP - N1 empty vector ; gift of P . Caswell , NAtuRe CeLL BiOLOGy | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATuRe Cell BIology University of Manchester ) or WT β 5 - GFP using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Thermo Fisher ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Six hours after transfection , cell cycle synchronization was initiated by adding 2 mM thymidine ( Sigma ) . After 18 h , cells were released by replating in fresh medium , and a second dose of thymidine was added 8 h later . Medium was replaced the next morning and imaging started 5 h after the second release . Images were acquired on an ASMDW live - cell imaging system ( Leica ) equipped with a Cascade II EM - CCD camera ( Photometrics ) and a × 20 / 0 . 50 NA plan Fluotar air objective . Images were collected every 10 min using Image Pro 6 . 3 software ( Media Cybernetics ) and processed using ImageJ . Mitotic alignment analysis . Before analysis of mitotic alignment , image files were computationally blinded by randomized file name encoding . Thereafter , Fiji software was used to measure the angular difference between the long axis of the mother cell before cell division , and the axis of cytokinesis . All observed cell division events were analysed . Where multiple attempts at cytokinesis were observed , the orientation of the first attempt was used for angular measurement . Data were summarized using R software . Adhesion assay . Cell adhesion assays were performed as described previously 68 . Briefly , non - tissue culture - treated , polystyrene 48 - well cluster plates ( Corning Costar Corporation ) were coated with 10 µ g ml − 1 vitronectin as detailed above , and blocked with 1 % heat - denatured BSA . A total of 5 × 10 4 CS1 - wt ( negative control ) or CS1 - β 5 cells were seeded per well and allowed to attach for 30 min under incubation conditions . Cells were treated during attachment as indicated with combinations of cytochalasin D ( 20 µ M ) and either cyclic RAD ( Arg - Ala - Asp ; non - inhibitory control ) or cyclic RGD ( competitive inhibitor of integrin β 5 - vitronectin interaction ) peptides ( 20 µ g ml − 1 ) ( provided by Merck and used as described previously 69 ) . After attachment , non - adherent cells were removed by repeated washing . Remaining cells were labelled with DAPI and imaged with a Nikon A1R confocal microscope and × 10 air objective , enabling automated cell counting via NIS elements software .

For this reason , sample sizes were based on standards in the field ( such as for FRAP analysis ) , or based on the number of cells / adhesions accessible through automated imaging and analysis ( where sample number typically exceeds current gold standards ) . At no time were the results of statistical comparisons ( e . g . Mann - Whitney U test ) used to motivate additional experiments aiming to achieve statistical significance . Data exclusions As described in text , 4 proteins detected in raw mass spectrometry data were excluded due to over - representation in a database of common contaminant proteins ( CRAPome database , Mellacheruvu et al . , 2013 ) . Replication All experiments were successfully replicated . The number of replicates is specified for each experiment . Randomization Sample randomization was not relevant to this study because analysed populations were assigned to classes based on objective measures of identity ( e . g . reticular versus classical adhesions defined by consistent quantitative criteria ) . Blinding Analysis of mitotic division axis alignment was manual and therefore computationally blinded . All other analyses were automated and therefore non - blinded .

Validation Details per Ab provided in Supplementary Table 4 . Eukaryotic cell lines Policy information about cell lines Cell line source ( s ) All cell lines were acquired directly from either ATCC or ECACC , with the exception of H1299 , CS - 1 and talin 1 null mouse embryonic stem cells . Authentication Cell lines acquired directly from either ATCC or ECACC have been authenticated by the provider . H1299 , CS - 1 and talin 1 null mouse embryonic stem cells were not authenticated . Mycoplasma contamination All cell lines were tested and found to be negative for mycoplasma Commonly misidentified lines ( See ICLAC register ) No cell lines used in this study were found in the database of commonly misidentified cell lines ( v8 . 0 ) that is maintained by ICLAC and NCBI Biosample
