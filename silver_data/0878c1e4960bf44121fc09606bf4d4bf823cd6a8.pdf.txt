This study focuses on how entrepreneurs , influenced by obsessive passion , are motivated to put great effort into taking advantage of business opportunities and accomplishing entrepreneurial goals . By using SPSS and AMOS tools to analyze the multi - source questionnaire of 208 entrepreneurs , the research results show that obsessive passion can promote entrepreneurial performance and opportunity recognition plays a mediating role . In addition , endogenous and exogenous fear of failure play different moderating roles in the effect of obsessive passion on opportunity recognition . The research conclusion deepens the theoretical understanding of entrepreneurial passion , opportunity recognition , and fear of failure at a more subtle level . KEYWORDS obsessive passion , opportunity recognition , fear of failure , entrepreneurial performance , entrepreneurs 1 . Introduction Passion is crucial for entrepreneurial progress ( Cardon et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2020 ) . Despite pervasive pressure , passionate entrepreneurs can mobilize their creativity and continue to establish their businesses . Some become addicted to it and work tirelessly around the clock . Entrepreneurs who are labeled “workaholics , ” “addicts , ” etc . are often influenced by a strong inclination to act on preferences or important issues . As an uncontrollable passion to engage in an activity ( Vallerand et al . , 2003 ; Cardon et al . , 2013 ; Fu et al . , 2022 ) , the strong behavioral inclination of obsessive passion is of practical importance in stimulating the desire to explore , motivate involvement , mobilize TYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 04 January 2023 DOI 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1037250 OPEN ACCESS EDITED BY Muhammad Aamir Shafique Khan , Jiangsu University , China REVIEWED BY Virginia Barba - Sánchez , Universidad de Castilla - La Mancha , SpainMajid Murad , Jiangsu University , ChinaDavid Ahlstrom , The Chinese University of Hong Kong , China * CORRESPONDENCE Xin Zhao zhaoshin _ 1993 @ 163 . com SPECIALTY SECTION This article was submitted to Organizational Psychology , a section of the journal Frontiers in Psychology RECEIVED 05 September 2022 ACCEPTED 09 December 2022 PUBLISHED 04 January 2023 CITATION Tu Y , Hao X , Rosak - Szyrocka J , Vasa L and Zhao X ( 2023 ) Obsessive passion , opportunity recognition , and entrepreneurial performance : The dual moderating effect of the fear of failure .

The nature of obsessive passion is that it is repetitive , uncontrollable , and based on long - term behavioral inclination and preference ( Vallerand et al . , 2003 ; Mageau et al . , 2005 ; Thorgren and Wincent , 2015 ; Fu et al . , 2022 ) . Obsessive - passionate individuals will put considerable time and effort into a job or task in order to gain social respect , maintain good external relations , and achieve performance requirements ( Vallerand et al . , 2003 , 2007 ; Karácsony et al . , 2020 ; Stroe et al . , 2020 ) . Some studies have pointed out that most entrepreneurs are driven by obsessive passion to perform entrepreneurial actions ( Thorgren and Wincent , 2015 ) . Although previous studies have demonstrated that passion can stimulate individuals to action in order to achieve anticipated goals ( Murnieks et al . , 2016 ; Fu et al . , 2022 ) , there is still limited theoretical comprehension and empirical evidence to demonstrate how obsessive passion can motivate entrepreneurs’ behaviors and affect their results . Firstly , we know little about how obsessive passion drives individual behavior , especially in the entrepreneurial context ( Stroe et al . , 2020 ) . Entrepreneurship is the process of developing business opportunities to achieve a return on entrepreneurial performance . It is necessary to explore the mechanism of the influence of obsessive passion on the recognition of entrepreneurial opportunity as well as entrepreneurial performance . Second , our understanding is limited as to whether obsessive passion has a positive impact in the entrepreneurial process ( Fu et al . , 2022 ) . Theoretical research indicates that obsessive passion is often associated with negative outcomes in daily life ( Siren et al . , 2016 ; Stroe et al . , 2020 ; Bayraktar and Jiménez , 2022 ) . However , obsessive passion plays an important role in focusing on work attention , increasing job involvement , and stimulating exploration desires ( Thorgren and Wincent , 2015 ) . This study builds a model of “obsessive passion - opportunity recognition - entrepreneurial performance” to understand how obsessive passion influences the response of entrepreneurs and the developmental effects of entrepreneurial ventures . Moreover , obsessive passion attaches great importance to the controlled internalization process . This is when individuals internalize their activities into their individual identity under the influence of external pressure ( Vallerand et al . , 2003 ; Cardon et al . , 2013 ) . Entrepreneurs with obsessive passion not only require complete accomplishment of entrepreneurial goals to achieve and support their own values , but also need to meet the attention and expectations of significant stakeholders , such as key partners , venture capitalists , and even family members ( Vallerand et al . , 2003 , 2007 ) . Therefore , the fear of failure in entrepreneurial actions is inevitable ( Bélanger et al . , 2013 ) . Based on this , to further consider the influence of fear of failure on the identification and exploration of opportunities for entrepreneurs with obsessive passion , this study introduces fear of failure as the boundary condition of the influence of obsessive passion on opportunity recognition and considers its moderating role . The structure of this article is as follows . First , a literature review is conducted to describe the research in respect of obsessive passion , opportunity recognition , fear of failure , and entrepreneurial performance . Second , we propose the research hypothesis . We then describe the research design and the specific empirical analysis process of this study . Finally , the theoretical model of obsessive passion , opportunity , and entrepreneurial performance and future perspectives are discussed . Specifically : ( 1 ) This study explores the effect of obsessive passion on entrepreneurial performance . It attempts to open the “black box” of the mechanism of obsessive passion and to deepen the theory of entrepreneurial passion and entrepreneurial performance . ( 2 ) We analyze the mediating effect of opportunity recognition in the relationship between obsessive passion and entrepreneurial performance . This is done in order to deepen the understanding of the process of entrepreneurial opportunity recognition , and to also enrich the previous research results of entrepreneurial cognition and behavior . ( 3 ) This paper explains the moderating effects of endogenous and exogenous fear of failure on obsessive passion and opportunity recognition . This will help explain the various action pathways of different types of fear of failure from a more subtle perspective . 2 . Literature review 2 . 1 . Obsessive passion The dualistic theoretical model of passion ( Vallerand et al . , 2003 ; Cardon et al . , 2013 ; Bayraktar and Jiménez , 2022 ) defines passion as a strong inclination toward a self - defining activity that one loves , finds important , and invests a significant amount of time and energy in . Compared to harmonious passion , obsessive passion refers to a controlled internalization of an activity into one’s identity ( Vallerand et al . , 2003 ) . The pivotal distinction between obsessive passion and harmonious passion is whether the urge to engage in the activity remains under the individual’s control ( Fu et al . , 2022 ) . Individuals with obsessive passion generally have an obvious inclination to engage in target activities and behaviors , frequently feel “cannot help but to engage in the passionate activity” ( Vallerand et al . , 2003 ; Patel et al . , 2015 ; Fu et al . , 2022 ) . This reveals the controlled internalization process of an individual’s external motivation to engage in an activity . This internalization comes from a variety of pressures , both from something attached to the activity—such as obtaining social recognition or fulfilling performance requirements—and because individuals feel that the excitement brought about by participating in the activity becomes uncontrollable ( Vallerand et al . , 2003 ; Klaukien et al . , 2013 ) . In turn , external pressures control the individual and compel him or her to pursue the activity to achieve and sustain these outcomes ( Stroe et al . , 2020 ) . Therefore , the higher the obsessive passion for an activity , the more an individual cannot resist the internal impulse to participate in the activity . This may also cause the individual to attach great importance to Tu et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1037250 Frontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin . org the target activity and pay ample time , energy , and resources ( Lalande et al . , 2017 ; Warnick et al . , 2018 ; Fu et al . , 2022 ) , as well as stimulate the desire to explore , constantly consider , and explore the novelty of the entrepreneurial process ; and stimulate the degree of engagement , which is specifically manifested as long - term and continuous entrepreneurial behavior . 2 . 2 . Opportunity recognition Opportunity recognition is a core prerequisite for entrepreneurship and business development . It is a complex process ( Shane and Venkataraman , 2000 ; Shepherd et al . , 2022 ) that reflects the comprehensive ability of entrepreneurs and start - ups to perceive the key components of entrepreneurship , such as the target market , user demand , resource acquisition , and environmental dynamics . Entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial organizations identify potentially feasible opportunities from various ideas , and continuously develop these opportunities . In this process , the potential value of opportunities is constantly reviewed , and entrepreneurs’ strategic positioning of opportunities is clarified . Indeed , opportunity recognition is not simply a cognitive process ( McMullen and Shepherd , 2006 ; Gregoire et al . , 2010 ) . It also embodies a behavioral response process that includes judgment , focus , and evaluation . 2 . 3 . Fear of failure The fear of failure is a psychological construct to explain the interaction between entrepreneurs’ cognitive , emotional , and motivational attributes in the context of achievement ; and is complicated ( Cacciotti et al . , 2016 , 2020 ) . Entrepreneurial activities are affected by obstacles , setbacks , and difficulties , which bring the risk of potential failure . It is inevitable that they will provoke an emotional experience and cognitive response to the fear of failure ( Kollmann et al . , 2017 ; Stroe et al . , 2020 ) . This fear of entrepreneurial failure is individual reactive and context - dependent . It is a consequence of internal and external interactions . Not only will individuals worry about the possible negative effects of failure on the self out of an internal ego need , but they will also worry about the negative evaluations of important others , namely endogenous and exogenous fear of failure ( Hao et al . , 2022 ) . Endogenous fear of failure is focused on the entrepreneur’s internal self . It is fear that a self - centered evaluation of failure may bring adverse consequences to oneself . When encountering the obstacles of entrepreneurial frustration , entrepreneurs induce endogenous fear of failure from the perspective of internal attribution of self - worth and ability . It is associated with feelings of shame and embarrassment , and fear of devaluing self - worth . The latter takes account of external interpersonal relationships , that is , focusing on others and emphasizing the fear triggered by changes in the connection between oneself and the surrounding relationships . Business activities are based on external resources , relationship networks , and business communication ( Wennberg et al . , 2013 ) . In the process of continuous contact with the outside world in a social network , entrepreneurs are prone to worry and be anxious about not being valued or even being unable to positively influence stakeholders and other important people . Due to fear of failure , individuals spare no effort to avoid adverse effects on their own behavior and subsequently affect the expected results and goals ( Cacciotti and Hayton , 2015 ; Kollmann et al . , 2017 ) . 2 . 4 . Entrepreneurial performance As a consequence of the enterprise fulfilling certain tasks or attaining certain goals in the process of entrepreneurship ( Sandberg and Hofer , 1987 ) , entrepreneurial performance will reflect the success or failure of entrepreneurial activity . Entrepreneurial performance is a scale and criterion for judging and testing the results of business activities . It is usually used to describe the achievements of entrepreneurial enterprises and the potential for future market growth ( Bates , 1998 ) . Specifically , it is not only related to the ability of the firm to achieve break - even rate of operation , but also reflects the competitive advantage of the firm and indicates the possibility of further development ( Chrisman et al . , 1998 ) . In conclusion , through a series of activities centered around entrepreneurship , enterprises will achieve diverse results that reflect their start - up and growth . This study understands entrepreneurial performance as a key indicator of whether an enterprise can further survive and grow . It focuses on obsessive passion as the critical factor in the study of the relationship between obsessive passion - opportunity recorecognition and entrepreneurial performance” to obsessive passion - opportunity recognition - entrepreneurial performance . It is beneficial to explore the internal mechanism that drives entrepreneurial performance . 3 . Hypothesis development and research model 3 . 1 . The influence of obsessive passion on entrepreneurial performance Obsessive passion means that individuals have a strong inclination to work and participate in activities which make them unable to control themselves . They therefore continuously commit to work and activities ( Vallerand et al . , 2003 ; Fu et al . , 2022 ) . In the process of constantly seeking business success , entrepreneurs with obsessive passion will improve their level of entrepreneurial effort , promote entrepreneurial persistence , and thus facilitate entrepreneurial performance . At the cognitive level , entrepreneurs with obsessive passion are stimulated by various pressures to devote considerable time Tu et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1037250 Frontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin . org and energy ( Vallerand et al . , 2007 ) in order to achieve high performance in their entrepreneurial activities . They will devote attention and process information related to the survival and development of the enterprise , concentrating their attention and cognition on entrepreneurial performance . Vallerand et al . ( 2003 ) demonstrated that individuals with obsessive passion fully focus on the task at hand , have an intensely strong inclination to achieve the goal , and are not distracted by other things . This focus on entrepreneurial activities can effectively achieve and promote entrepreneurial performance . At the motivation level , obsessive - passionate entrepreneurs often focus on performance , interpersonal relationships , and social expectations ( Vallerand et al . , 2007 ) . When individual identity and self - concept are integrated , the entrepreneur is prone to carry out activities consistent with their identity , such as entrepreneurs and leaders . They derive excitement from them , constantly stimulated by the power and ideas to engage in entrepreneurial behaviors . They usually continue to commit to entrepreneurship with a strong passion to achieve entrepreneurial performance goals . In conclusion , entrepreneurs with obsessive passion can boost their entrepreneurial performance by recognizing their focus and motivation to achieve their goals . Thus , we propose the following hypothesis : H1 : Obsessive passion has a positive effect on entrepreneurial performance . 3 . 2 . The relationship between obsessive passion and opportunity recognition The recognition of entrepreneurial opportunities is usually a reflection of the entrepreneur’s psychology and other subtle elements ( Gregoire et al . , 2010 ) . When entrepreneurs seek opportunities to achieve their entrepreneurial goals and external expectations , they can mobilize their cognition , alertness , depth , and breadth of information collection . They will use this to promote the possibility of identifying potential opportunities . At the cognitive level , entrepreneurs with high obsessive passion are likely to devote considerable time and energy to entrepreneurial activities ( Stroe et al . , 2020 ) . Entrepreneurship is crucial to them , as they tend to seek opportunities to prove themselves . This cognitive belief provides a major impetus for continuous exploration of opportunities . At the motivation level , individuals with a strong inclination to complete certain tasks are usually characterized by evaluation orientation , repetitive thinking , and a keen awareness of market changes . In this way , key opportunity clues can be captured , and potential business opportunities can be found more easily than others . They will use their contacts and connections , evaluation skills , and judgment ( Gaglio and Katz , 2001 ; Ardichvili et al . , 2003 ) . In summary , entrepreneurs with obsessive passion are more capable of recognizing opportunities than are those without obsessive passion . Based on the above analysis , we proposed the following hypothesis : H2 : Obsessive passion has a positive effect on opportunity recognition . 3 . 3 . The mediating role of opportunity recognition The creative use of opportunities to create value is a key to promoting performance and achieving entrepreneurial success ( Shane and Venkataraman , 2000 ) . The process of entrepreneurs searching for valuable information in the external environment and identifying opportunities is an important source of potential business opportunities . This also lays the foundation for subsequent value creation . Only by finding suitable business opportunities can enterprises survive and achieve good performance ( Donbesuur et al . , 2020 ) . From a cognitive perspective , opportunity recognition is the process by which entrepreneurs perceive and conceptualize opportunities in a complex business environment . They do this to realize value increments ( Gregoire et al . , 2010 ) , stimulate the generation of new wealth , and thus promote entrepreneurial performance . In addition , from the perspective of motivation , the objective of the opportunity recognition behavior of entrepreneurs is to achieve both entrepreneurial success and enterprise survival and development . To realize innovation , sustainability , and feasibility , the active and alert exploration of these potential opportunities can help enterprises establish competitive advantages in the market . It will help them avoid being imitated by others , and obtain higher returns on performance ( Donbesuur et al . , 2020 ) . In summary , opportunity recognition often leads entrepreneurs to find profitable and feasible business opportunities that play a crucial role in entrepreneurial performance , and there is a positive correlation between them . Based on the reasoning above , we propose the following : H3 : Opportunity recognition has a positive effect on entrepreneurial performance . Opportunity recognition is an important behavioral manifestation of obsessive passion and is also a vital driver of entrepreneurial performance . Obsessive passion can motivate entrepreneurs to put sufficient effort into capturing opportunity - related information and recognizing opportunities . This will lead them to explore and achieve entrepreneurial performance goals through the identified opportunities . At the cognitive level , obsessive - passionate entrepreneurs who commit considerable time and energy to their businesses tend to be more sensitive to the outside world . They pay more attention to various types of information in terms of cognition and attention ( Vallerand et al . , 2007 ) , and gather a wider range of information . Tu et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1037250 Frontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin . org Comprehensive , large - scale , and heterogeneous information significantly increases the potential for opportunity recognition . It also provides more valuable opportunities , and makes subsequent opportunity exploitation more effective , thereby promoting entrepreneurial performance . At the level of motivation , entrepreneurs with obsessive passion care about their external views and social expectations ( Vallerand et al . , 2007 ) . Interpersonal pressure , social expectations , and external attention catalyze the attachment of importance to social networks , which are key sources of entrepreneurial resources and information acquisition ( Birley , 1985 ) . Individuals with such resources are better able to effectively recognize opportunities , effectively promote enterprises that are profitable and promote entrepreneurial performance ( Donbesuur et al . , 2020 ) . In conclusion , the strong inclination of obsessive passion is reflected in the response to opportunity recognition . As a key linkage , opportunity recognition will eventually affect entrepreneurial performance . Thus , this study proposes the following hypothesis : H4 : Opportunity recognition mediates the relationship between obsessive passion and entrepreneurial performance . 3 . 4 . The moderating role of fear of failure Endogenous fear of failure reflects embarrassment and shame , and internal fear of devaluing self - worth . From a cognitive perspective , this inner - negative perception stimulates entrepreneurs to pay more attention to internal adjustments and moderation . However , these individuals have limited cognitive and psychological resources ( Donbesuur et al . , 2020 ) . Focusing limited cognitive resources on internal regulation will reduce attention to external interpersonal relationships and social recognition . It will further weaken the intense behavioral inclination to constantly seek and explore opportunities that focus on social respect and recognition from others . From the perspective of motivation , the motivation for opportunity recognition driven by obsessive passion mainly comes from the external pressure to obtain social recognition or fulfill performance requirements . The inclination of individuals to feel that the excitement brought about by participating in activities then becomes uncontrollable ( Klaukien et al . , 2013 ) . The inherent fear induces negative emotional experiences and the shame and embarrassment of entrepreneurs ( Mcgregor and Elliot , 2005 ; Stroe et al . , 2020 ) . This further weakens motivation and excitement , hindering their focus on the task at hand . It also prevents them from engaging in full emotional and effective processing of external information searching and opportunity exploration . Based on the above reasoning , we contend that under the influence of limited cognitive resources and negative affections , endogenous fear of failure weakens the positive relationship between obsessive passion and opportunity recognition . Consequently , this study proposes the following hypothesis : H5a : Endogenous fear of failure negatively moderates the relationship between obsessive passion and opportunity recognition . The exogenous fear of failure , which starts with external relations and takes others as the core , emphasizes an individual’s external recognition of others , social status , and other concerns ( Hao et al . , 2022 ) . The process by which obsessive passion stimulates the entrepreneur to turn external pressure into motivation is influenced by this exogenous fear of failure . It encourages the recognition of the possibilities of opportunity from a cognitive perspective , damaged social status , and negative social evaluation of cognition will stimulate the entrepreneur to draw on their cognitive resources . They will also apply time and effort to tackle the pressure and use it to safeguard the interests of the external network , protect their social status , and constantly look for new opportunities and potential business opportunities ( Hao et al . , 2022 ) . It enhances the obsessive passion of the individual’s uncontrollable action preference caused by external pressure , and then promotes the possibility of opportunity recognition . From the perspective of motivation , focusing on external factors , such as social identity , stimulates the motivation of individuals to deal with external relevance events ( Bernabé et al . , 2014 ) . The obsessive passion reflected by this motivational inclination ( Vallerand et al . , 2003 ) can stimulate the search for external information , and valuable clues . It further improves the belief in finding opportunities that may achieve external expectations , and also enhances the positive effect of obsessive passion on opportunity recognition . Above all , the exogenous fear of failure , which focuses on relationships and connections with others , has a positive moderating effect on the positive relationship between obsessive passion and opportunity recognition . The higher the fear of exogenous failure , the more entrepreneurs will produce behavioral preferences that focus on social recognition and respect . Therefore , this study proposes the following hypothesis : H5b : Exogenous fear of failure positively moderates the relationship between obsessive passion and opportunity recognition . Based on the aforementioned analysis , this study built a theoretical model of obsessive passion , opportunity recognition , fear of failure , and entrepreneurial performance , as shown in Figure 1 . 4 . Materials and methods 4 . 1 . Sample and procedures Following Amezcua et al . ( 2013 ) , this study defines entrepreneurial ventures as those established for no more than Tu et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1037250 Frontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin . org 5 years . The main participants in the research were the founders of startups . We used a variety of techniques for data collection , including : ( 1 ) investigated the start - up parks and incubators in Jiangsu , China . We conducted field inspections with the help of Chinese entrepreneurs’ exchange meetings , and distributed questionnaires with the help of the principals and staff ; ( 2 ) used professional research institutions to conduct questionnaire distribution and data collection ; and ( 3 ) mobilized various contacts to contact entrepreneurs , and invited the respondents to fill in the questionnaire by means of QR code scanning and link transmission . The entire data collection process focused on the details of completing the time , manner , place , questionnaire number , and other information . Contact was maintained with research institutions and enterprises throughout the process , tracking the progress of the survey , and reviewing the feedback . The entire sample data collection process took half a year . The survey subjects covered Beijing , Shanghai , Jiangsu , and other Chinese regions with a high entrepreneurial activity index . 638 questionnaires were collected . After careful screening , 208 valid questionnaires were accepted , yielding an effective questionnaire recovery rate of 32 . 6 % . The samples were normally distributed and were an even representation . The proportions of male and female entrepreneurs were 67 . 3 and 32 . 7 % , respectively . This is roughly consistent with the proportion of male and female entrepreneurs in the GEM database . In terms of age and education , 70 . 7 % of the respondents had a bachelor’s degree or above , and most ( 72 . 6 % ) of the respondents were under 35 years old . This indicating that most entrepreneurs in this survey were young people with higher education . Additionally , more than 70 % of the respondents said they were married , and 88 . 9 % of the respondents ( 88 . 9 % ) started small and minor businesses . 4 . 2 . Measures 4 . 2 . 1 . Obsessive passion Murnieks et al . ( 2014 ) used the obsessive passion part of the binary passion scale developed by Vallerand et al . ( 2003 ) , which has good reliability and validity . There are seven measurement items ; the example items are “The urge is so strong . I cannot help myself from doing this entrepreneurial activity” and “I have difficulty imagining my life without this entrepreneurial activity . ” Scores were scored using a five - point Likert scale , from 1 to 5 representing a range from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree . ” 4 . 2 . 2 . Opportunity recognition To measure opportunity recognition , we referred to the scale of Gregoire et al . ( 2010 ) , including “the degree of alignment between an opportunity means of supply and target markets” and “the perceptions of an opportunity general feasibility . ” Specifically , we used five items , such as “The proposed business solution can be used to solve the problems of the targeted market” and “Applying the proposed business solution with individuals / firms in the targeted market constitutes a feasible opportunity . ” Respondents were asked to choose the option that best reflected the real situation based on the relevant situation of the start - up , ranging from 1 = “not at all” to 5 = “a great deal . ” 4 . 2 . 3 . Fear of failure Fear of failure was measured based on Performance Failure Appraisal Inventory ( PFAI ) of Conroy et al . ( 2002 ) , which is one of the most widely used scales of fear of failure . Many scholars have used it to explore individual psychological and behavioral activities ( Wood and Pearson , 2009 ; Mitchell and Shepherd , 2011 ; Leon and Anna , 2018 ) . To capture the forms and dimensions of fear of failure in an entrepreneurial context through field research and data analysis , a scale of entrepreneurial fear of failure was developed and FIGURE 1 Research model . Tu et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1037250 Frontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin . org verified in entrepreneurial practice . It measured a total of 16 items to capture two potential common factors ( Hao et al . , 2022 ) . Among them , the endogenous fear of failure included “When I am failing , I am afraid that I might not have enough talent” and other five items . And a representative item for exogenous fear of failure is “When I am not succeeding , my value decreases for some people . ” The measurements used five - point rating scales anchored 1 = “does not correspond at all to me” to 5 = “corresponds exactly to me . ” 4 . 2 . 4 . Entrepreneurial performance Referring to the measurement methods used by Liu et al . ( 2019 ) , the performance measurements included annual profit , sales , market share , and growth rate of new employees . It specifically included “The annual growth rate of enterprise sales compared with the local average level of the same industry” and three other metrics . The use of these relative performance indicators yielded more accurate and objective results . 4 . 2 . 5 . Control variables It generally includes individual and enterprise - level variables , such as the entrepreneur’s gender , age , education , marital status , number of start - ups , pre - entrepreneurial work experience and time , as well as enterprise size , industry , and region ( Ozgen and Baron , 2007 ; Khan et al . , 2017 , 2019a ; Liu et al . , 2019 ; Stroe et al . , 2020 ) . 5 . Results 5 . 1 . Reliability and validity All the variables were tested for reliability and validity ( Table 1 ) . The results of the reliability analysis showed that Cronbach’s α coefficient for each variable was above 0 . 8 . This indicates that the questionnaire had a high reliability . The factor loadings , composite reliabilities ( CRs ) , and average variance extracted ( AVE ) values were higher than the recommended coefficient weights ( Fornell and Larcker , 1981 ) . Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted using AMOS 24 . 0 . Table 2 shows that the fitting degree of the five - factor model F5 is optimal , and all fitting indices are within a reasonable range , indicating that the questionnaire has relatively ideal external construct validity , and the follow - up analysis can be continued . 5 . 2 . Descriptive statistics The mean , standard deviation , and correlation coefficient of each variable are listed in Table 3 . The results showed that the correlation coefficients between obsessive passion , opportunity , and entrepreneurial performance are 0 . 314 and 0 . 192 , respectively , indicating a positive correlation between obsessive passion and opportunity recognition and entrepreneurial performance . The correlation coefficient between opportunity recognition and entrepreneurial performance is 0 . 411 ( p < 0 . 01 ) , indicating a positive correlation between opportunity recognition and entrepreneurial performance . 5 . 3 . Hypothesis testing 5 . 3 . 1 . Mediating effect analysis This study used two approaches to test the mediating role of opportunity identification ( Fritz and MacKinnon , 2007 ; MacKinnon et al . , 2007 ) . Using test steps of Baron and Kenny ( 1986 ) as a reference , the cross - level regression method was used to verify the research hypothesis , and the hypothesis test results of each model are shown in Table 4 . Models 1 and 5 describe the relationships between the control variables , entrepreneurial performance , and opportunity recognition . Model 2 confirms a significant positive correlation between obsessive passion and entrepreneurial performance ( β = 0 . 256 , p < 0 . 01 ) , thus supporting Hypothesis 1 . Model 6 shows that obsessive passion has a significantly positive effect on opportunity recognition ( β = 0 . 301 , p < 0 . 01 ) , supporting Hypothesis 2 . Model 3 shows a positive correlation between opportunity recognition and entrepreneurial performance ( β = 0 . 440 , p < 0 . 01 ) , thus verifying Hypothesis 3 . The results of Model 4 show that when the independent variable ( obsessive passion ) and the mediating variable ( opportunity recognition ) are simultaneously included in the regression model at the same time , opportunity recognition still has a significant positive impact on entrepreneurial performance ( β = 0 . 392 , p < 0 . 01 ) . However , the positive effect of obsessive passion on entrepreneurial performance is weakened ( β = 0 . 138 , p < 0 . 05 ) . Therefore , opportunity recognition partially mediates the relationship between obsessive passion and entrepreneurial performance . Next , based on Preacher and Hayes ( 2004 ) , this study uses the bootstrapping method to further examine the mediating effect of opportunity recognition between obsessive passion and entrepreneurial performance . The results of the analysis show that the indirect effect of opportunity recognition on entrepreneurial performance was 0 . 1131 ( with a confidence interval : 0 . 0501 to 0 . 1955 at 95 % CI and does not cross the zero value ) in 5 , 000 number of bootstrap samples . This finding indicates that opportunity recognition has a significant mediating effect on the relationship between obsessive passion and entrepreneurial performance ( p < 0 . 01 ) . Therefore , Hypothesis 4 is supported . 5 . 3 . 2 . Moderating effect analysis To test the moderating effect , hierarchical regression was conducted by constructing the interaction terms . Models 7 and 8 show the moderating effect of the fear of failure . Endogenous fear of failure had a negative moderating effect on the relationship between obsessive passion and opportunity recognition ( β = − 0 . 136 , p < 0 . 05 ) . Thus , Hypothesis 5A is supported . Exogenous fear of failure had a positive moderating effect on the relationship between obsessive passion and opportunity recognition ( β = 0 . 107 , p < 0 . 1 ) , thus verifying Hypothesis 5B . The moderating effects are shown in Figures 2 , 3 .

Robustness tests To further clarify the robustness of the test results , we combined the following two auxiliary means for testing : On the one hand , obsessive passion means that individuals will feel stressed and invest considerable energy and emotion urgently and strongly in related activities in order to achieve the set goals . Therefore , this kind of “urgency” and “intensity” are particularly significant in the behavior and activities of obsessive - passionate entrepreneurs . This study therefore selected “unable to hold oneself back” and “obsession , ” as the two factors that can most interfere with individual actions . The two variables were reanalyzed using regression as a new variable . On the other hand , because the underlying goal of venture enterprises is to earn profits and survive , survival is the absolute index for measuring entrepreneurial performance ( Chrisman et al . , 1998 ) . Therefore , we select “annual profit , sales and market share , ” which are more representative of “profitability , ” to verify whether the research hypothesis is consistent with expectations . Using the changed independent variable “obsessive passion , ” and dependent variable “entrepreneurial performance” measurement items for detection and analysis , it was found that the original main effect of “obsessive passion - opportunity recognition - entrepreneurial performance” and the two - sided moderating effects of endogenous and exogenous fear of failure are still significant , as shown in Table 5 below , verifying the stability of the conclusions of this study . 6 .

However , it is not clear how obsessive passion works , especially in entrepreneurial contexts . This is because entrepreneurs turn extrinsic stress into intrinsic motivation and drive themselves to achieve entrepreneurial excellence . This study takes opportunity recognition as a mediating variable , and tests the relationship between obsessive passion and entrepreneurial performance . It then introduces endogenous and exogenous fear of failure to explore the boundary effects of obsessive passion and opportunity recognition . Through an empirical test of large - scale data , the study finds that the inclination of obsessive passion positively affects entrepreneurial performance , and opportunity recognition is a key link between obsessive passion and entrepreneurial performance . Fear of failure is a “double - edged” sword in the mechanism of obsessive passion and opportunity recognition . Endogenous fear of failure weakens the positive effect of obsessive passion on opportunity recognition , while exogenous fear of failure , which focuses on the relationship and connection TABLE 4 Hypothesis test results .

Theoretical contributions Starting from obsessive passion to explore its influence , this study not only expands the understanding of the effect of obsessive passion , but also enriches the theoretical scope of entrepreneurial passion . At present , most related research on entrepreneurial passion explores it as an overall concept , and a few empirical studies attaching importance to a specific passion are mostly focused on the level of harmonious passion . The results of this study further broaden the theoretical application scope of obsessive passion and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of entrepreneurial passion . Moreover , in the passion literature , obsessive passion—that is , the strong inclination of an individual to engage in an activity— has been typified by labels such as “work - life imbalance , ” “authoritarian decision - making , ” or “physical and mental health problems” ( Vallerand et al . , 2003 ; Mol et al . , 2019 ) . The few previous studies of obsessive passion tended to view it as the “dark side” of passion ( Siren et al . , 2016 ; Stroe et al . , 2020 ) , concentrating on the negative effects of obsessive passion on individuals and rarely paying attention to its positive effects on entrepreneurs . In fact , obsessive passion is frequently accompanied by entrepreneurs who have a certain incentive and stimulation effect . For example , Thorgren and Wincent ( 2015 ) state that more entrepreneurs are driven by obsessive passion to conduct entrepreneurial activities continuously . This study finds that the positive effect of obsessive passion plays a key role in stimulating entrepreneurs to take initiative , which can effectively stimulate entrepreneurs to recognize opportunities and promote entrepreneurial performance . Therefore , this study provides new insights on the content of obsessive passion . It deeply explores the positive impact of obsessive passion on opportunity recognition and entrepreneurial performance . It also enriches the existing research results on the “positive side” of obsessive passion . Opportunity recognition is introduced as a mediating variable to analyze the path mechanism of the impact of obsessive passion on entrepreneurial performance . This further deepens the understanding of the mechanism between the two and strengthens the understanding of the process of opportunity recognition by entrepreneurs and their causes and consequences . Previous studies on the individual influencing factors of opportunity recognition mainly emphasize the input resources , such as time , money , and effort of entrepreneurs ( Mitchell and Shepherd , 2011 ) . Entrepreneurs’ individual characteristics , such as prior experience , creativity , and cognitive capacity ( Shepherd and Detienne , 2005 ; Tumasjan and Braun , 2011 ) , were also reviewed . From the perspective of obsessive passion , this study considers the relationship between the obsessive passion and the process of TABLE 5 Robustness tests .

It enriches the exploration of entrepreneurial psychology regarding the mechanism of opportunity recognition . In addition , the conclusion of the positive relationship between opportunity recognition and entrepreneurial performance further shows that entrepreneurial opportunities need to be profitable ( Shane and Venkataraman , 2000 ) . Opportunity recognition lays the foundation for the subsequent development of opportunities to promote entrepreneurial performance . By identifying potentially effective opportunities , entrepreneurs can obtain sustainable profits and achieve corporate survival . Research on the double - sided effect of fear of failure clarifies the boundary conditions of the relationship between obsessive passion and opportunity recognition . This adds a new explanation for appreciating their internal logic . It also shows that fear of failure are a “double - edged sword , ” which can offer a more comprehensive understanding of the construct and influence of fear of failure . According to Cacciotti et al . ( 2016 ) , fear of failure is multifaceted , and its behavioral reactions are not limited to negative aspects , such as inhibition and depression . It can also have motivative and incentive effects . This study also proves that endogenous and exogenous fear of failure play diverse roles in the relationship between obsessive passion and opportunity recognition . The former weakens the positive relationship between obsessive passion and opportunity recognition , whereas the latter enhances the positive effect of obsessive passivity on opportunity recognition . In contrast with previous research findings on the subject , which showed that fear of failure is not conducive to the identification and utilization of opportunities , hindering entrepreneurial behavior , and suppressing entrepreneurial performance ( Kollmann et al . , 2017 ; Stroe et al . , 2020 ) , the results of this study provide a new logic and empirical verification to explain how fear of failure exerts different influential effects . 6 . 2 . Managerial implications First , entrepreneurs need to understand the psychological status of obsessive passion and turn external pressure into internal motivation . They then need to improve their entrepreneurial effort under the stimulation of moderate obsessive passion in order to boost their subsequent opportunity recognition and entrepreneurial performance . The psychology of entrepreneurs has an important impact on entrepreneurial behavior ( Shepherd , 2004 ) . This study breaks away from previous cognition and identifies the advantages of obsessive passion , which plays a key role in stimulating opportunities to identify and achieve entrepreneurial achievements . Therefore , entrepreneurs need to face their own obsessive passion , adjust their own state , and reasonably turn pressure into motivation under moderate obsessive passion . Second , we corrected the bias of fear of failure and examined its impact of fear of failure in a targeted manner . The fear of failure from different sources has different ways and means of action . Therefore , it is vital to bravely face realistic challenges and inner fears , analyze the content of different levels of fear of failure , and exert the motivational effect of fear of failure . Third , entrepreneurship education trainers and workers should pay attention to the psychological conditions of entrepreneurs , such as obsessive passion and fear of failure . It is essential to attach importance to internal psychological guidance , and fully mobilize the initiative of entrepreneurs . Simultaneously , it is important to correct their cognitive prejudices , see a dialectical view of the influence of obsessive passion and fear of failure , and provide help when entrepreneurs seek opportunities and pursue goals . 6 . 3 . Limitations and future directions This study has three main limitations that need to be further explored and improved in the future : ( 1 ) The impact of obsessive passion and fear of failure may vary according to entrepreneurs’ social , economic , and cultural environments ( Molina - Ramírez and Barba - Sánchez , 2021 ; Barba - Sánchez et al . , 2022 ) . Therefore , cross - border comparisons may help analyze the impact of national and policy environments on enterprise behavior and performance ( Khan et al . , 2019b ) , as well as the boundary role of fear of failure . ( 2 ) Cross - sectional data was used for this empirical analysis . In future , the impact of time should be considered . Dynamic data on passion , fear of failure , opportunity recognition , and entrepreneurial performance changes can be obtained through cross - stage and multi - point tracking—in order to more comprehensively explore the dynamic process of passion . ( 3 ) This study mainly used questionnaires to obtain first - hand data and adopted a self - report measurement method to collect data . Although various measures have been taken to reduce deviation and data deviation tests have been conducted , it is difficult to overcome the inherent defects of questionnaires and retrospective studies . In future research , we can consider the comprehensive use of experiments , case studies , and other methods for more accurate analysis . 7 . Conclusion Obsessive passion plays an important role in the competitive business environment and is the key factor driving entrepreneurs to engage in entrepreneurial activities . By tracking how entrepreneurs can facilitate opportunity recognition and promote entrepreneurial performance under the influence of obsessive passion , this study expands current research on entrepreneurial psychology , cognition , and behavior . Our discoveries that endogenous and exogenous Tu et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1037250 Frontiers in Psychology 13 frontiersin . org fear of failure play dual moderating roles in the effect of obsessive passion on opportunity recognition provide a way to understand the effect of fear of failure at a more subtle level . We hope that this study will spur more research on obsessive passion , opportunity recognition and fear of failure .
