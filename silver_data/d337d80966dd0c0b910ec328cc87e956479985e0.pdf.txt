Therefore , the impact of these policies needs to be assessed appropriately . We propose a methodology inspired by event study analysis in econometrics to quantify the effect of the initial major COVID - 19 non - clinical interventions , i . e . , nationwide school closure and lockdown , across 7 European countries . We focus on the first implementation of these policies as the initial response to a pandemic is critical for controlling disease spread and providing robust evidence for government action and policy decision - making at the earliest pandemic stage . Besides an average mobility reduction of 7 . 5 % ( ±7 . 0 ) after school closure and 13 . 6 % ( ±12 . 1 ) after lockdown , we found a higher percentage of overall mobility reduction in countries that implemented lockdown within five days of school closure . COVID - 19 - related fatalities were significantly lower in countries that took school closure and lockdown measures at the earliest stage of the pandemic . The close succession of school closures and lockdown policies impacts mobility , lowering COVID - 19 - related cases and deaths . The lockdown has nearly as double an impact as the school closure impacts on mobility . This implies that the implementation of school closure policies by itself cannot be used as a replacement for the lockdown policy . Our findings provide important insight into how government policies should be shaped and implemented in future pandemics similar to COVID - 19 . Keywords — COVID - 19 intervention , policy impact , pandemic control , nationwide lockdown , nationwide school - closure I . I NTRODUCTION Covid - 19 has become one of the worst pandemics ever recorded due to its speed and magnitude [ 1 ] , with more than 131 million confirmed cases and 2 . 9 million deaths worldwide as of April 2021 [ 2 ] . To limit the spread of the virus , governments have imposed different combinations of unprecedented non - clinical ( or non - pharmaceutical ) interventions , albeit with varying degrees of enforcement [ 3 ] . These measures include self - isolation , social distancing , public gathering bans , travel bans , school closures , and lockdowns . Epidemiological studies have suggested [ 3 - 5 ] that non - clinical interventions will decrease the size of the pandemic and distribute the number of confirmed cases over time . Although all non - clinical interventions aim to reduce person - to - person contact , they have different degrees of impact on the spread of the virus [ 6 ] . The two primary and socio - economically costly policies , school closure and lockdown , have been deemed an ahigh impacts strategy to reduce the number of contacts within a country . School closure intervention is a nationwide closure , usually including primary , secondary , and higher education closures . Lockdown intervention refers to strict legislation related to restraining person - to - person contact . This includes banning any non - essential movement , school closure , and an order for the public to stay at home unless for exercise or essential tasks . Understanding and quantifying the degree to which the non - clinical interventions control the pandemic and what will be at stake if the interventions are lifted is crucial , considering these interventions ' enormous economic and social costs [ 3 ] . Quantifying school closure and lockdown interventions from the dairy case and death data would provide a better measure . Still , there is a lag of up to 14 days between infection and symptoms [ 7 , 8 ] , and up to 44 days between symptom onset and death [ 9 ] . Hence , to use this data , the lag period distribution must be assumed , and the number of fatalities needs to be forecasted for a stretched period . In addition , these data are often underreported . School closure and lockdown interventions are expected to result in a behavioral change within a country , which can be traced through mobility data . Mobility data display the change in visits to different places . They are generated using mobile internet [ 10 ] by counting the number of requests made to map applications for direction or data from users who have turned on their location history setting [ 11 , 12 ] . Inspired by event study analysis methods in econometrics , we propose a statistical technique that evaluates the impact of non - clinical interventions . Event study analysis has been widely used in econometrics to measure the effect of a particular event on the overall performance of a firm ' s stock market [ 13 , 14 ] . Using this method , investors evaluate the effect of an event on corporate performance using changes in trading activities in the stock market [ 15 ] . We apply the proposed method to quantify how much the initial nationwide school closure and lockdown policies reduced mobility . Many countries have implemented multiple nationwide and local school closures and lockdown policies . For instance , France , Italy , and the UK entered their third 2023 IEEE IAS Global Conference on Emerging Technologies ( GlobConET ) Loughborough University , London , United Kingdom .

Restrictions apply . nationwide lockdown by April 2021 . As the pandemic persists , more nationwide school closures and lockdown policies will likely be implemented worldwide . This reflects the reluctance of many policymakers to implement strict national school closures and lockdown policies at the earliest stage of the pandemic . Also , these late - implemented policies were lifted prematurely before these policies were fully effective during the pandemic . This forces policymakers to face the costly decisions of implementing these policies multiple times . Studies show that countries with strict and timely implementation of nationwide school closures and lockdowns better managed the disease and avoided a second national school closure and lockdown [ 16 ] . This study ' s scope is to quantify the first nationwide school closure and lockdown solely . We chose to focus on the initial response because it has tremendous implications for controlling the spread of disease . This analysis provides insight that strategically informs government response and policy decisions at the earliest stage of future pandemics . In this study , we analyze mobility patterns before and after implementing two non - clinical interventions in 7 European countries between February 15 , 2020 , - May 29 , 2020 . We then explore why a particular measure was more successful in one country but not in another . This study also gives insight into the consequence of lifting school closures and lockdowns . This method will also help design appropriate and timely interventions for a potential new wave of infection and other future pandemics similar to COVID - 19 . The rest of the paper is organized as follows . Section 2 presents an overview of existing models and their related challenges in measuring the impact of mitigation policies . Section 3 provides an overview of our method . Section 4 describes the data used and presents the experimental findings . Section 5 offers a detailed discussion of the empirical results and COVID - 19 death data . Finally , Section 6 concludes the paper . II . LITERATURE REVIEW Prior studies have shown that reducing the amount of person - to - person contact is an effective measure to control the spread of viral infectious disease [ 17 , 18 ] . Recent research on COVID - 19 in China [ 19 ] also supports the significant role of mitigation policies in reducing mobility . However , quantifying the role of non - clinical interventions in previous pandemics is difficult as very few data are available . For example , the deadliest 1918 pandemic killed over 40 million people worldwide . However , limited data is available to track mobility during that period [ 20 ] . Although the lockdown and school closure mitigations are costly , there is limited knowledge of their overall effect on the COVID - 19 pandemic [ 21 ] . Most of the knowledge regarding non - clinical interventions comes from computer simulation ( epidemiological models ) [ 22 ] . Thus , most government mitigations are primarily based on epidemiological models and educated beliefs of public compliance . For example , the epidemiological model by Ferguson et al . [ 23 ] altered the initial stance of the UK government ' s herd immunity policy . Gupta et al . [ 6 ] track the public and private response to the COVID - 19 epidemic in the United States local governments and states using event study analysis and commercially provided data . The study found that the average time spent at home increased from 9 . 1 to 13 . 9 hours between March 1 and April 11 , 2020 . Davies et al . [ 24 ] also adopted an epidemiological model ( SEIR ) and used the primary reproductive number to measure the impact of different interventions of COVID - 19 in the UK . Their findings show that combining the interventions reduced the direct reproductive number more effectively . This paper concludes that only the lockdown period was sufficient to bring the primary reproductive number below one . Giordano et al . [ 25 ] also proposed an extended version of the SEIR model , suggesting that adopting social distancing measures is necessary and practical . They also concluded that social distancing measures should be promptly enforced at the initial stage of the pandemic , together with testing . Other findings show that a combination of non - pharmaceutical interventions which are less intrusive and drastic , like national lockdowns , can effectively curve the spread of the virus [ 26 ] . Askitas et al . [ 27 ] also support the claim of [ 26 ] that canceling public events by enforcing restrictions on private gatherings , followed by nationwide closure of schools , has the most pronounced effect on reducing the spread of the virus . Compliance with the COVID - 19 mitigation policy is also a significant factor contributing to non - pharmaceutical interventions ' effectiveness [ 26 ] . Yamamoto et al . [ 28 ] proposed a model which quantifies the compliance of COVID - 19 mitigation policies . One challenge of using epidemiological models is measuring the magnitude of response and compliance by the people . Most epidemiological models assume mitigation policies have the same effect in different countries , geographic areas , and cultures [ 29 ] . However , the degree of enforcement varies among countries . While some countries have stringent rules , including fines for non - compliance , others follow a more relaxed approach [ 30 ] . The proposed method in this paper is entirely data - driven . It can fill the gap by providing near - real - time daily statistics on the effectiveness of the lockdown and school closure policies using mobility data as input . III . THE PROPOSED METHOD This paper aims to quantify the role of two non - clinical interventions ( school closure and lockdown ) in restricting the movement of people within selected geographical locations where either or both policies have been implemented . We do not consider other non - clinical interventions implemented before and after these policies . Different approaches might also impact mobility , but not at the scale of school closures and lockdowns . The results of our proposed model , details of which are discussed below , are integrated with COVID - 19 death data to quantify the impact of a given policy on the fatalities attributable to the pandemic ( Fig . 1 ) 2 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply . Fig . 1 . Visualization of the proposed method . Let PD be the Date a policy is implemented , represented as PD = t0 . Then let Prior Information ( PI ) be before the policy implementation date . Then , PI = t - PD . For example , PI = + 3 represents the third day after the policy , and PI = - 3 represents the third day before the policy . The PI start date is set to February 15 , 2020 . To use both Apple and Google mobility data , we fit the regression model defined in Eq . 1 for each policy ' s pre - policy implementation period ( t _ ( = PI ) ) separately . Once the model coefficients are obtained , we then fit this model to all the data ( t = Feb 15 , 2020 , to May 29 , 2020 ) to find the expected mobility of each policy (cid:2417)(cid:4666)(cid:3)(cid:1833)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:4670)(cid:1872) (cid:2880)(cid:3)(cid:3017)(cid:3010) (cid:3)(cid:3) (cid:4671)(cid:4667)(cid:3)(cid:3404) (cid:3)(cid:2009) (cid:3397) (cid:3)(cid:2010)(cid:3435)(cid:1827)(cid:3)(cid:4666)(cid:1872) (cid:2880)(cid:3017)(cid:3010) (cid:4667)(cid:3439)(cid:3)(cid:3397) (cid:2013)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:4666)(cid:883)(cid:4667) Where (cid:2417)(cid:4666)(cid:3)(cid:1833)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:4670)(cid:1872) (cid:2880)(cid:3)(cid:3017)(cid:3010) (cid:3)(cid:3) (cid:4671)(cid:4667) (cid:3404)(cid:3) is the expected mobility of the Google mobility data given (cid:1827)(cid:3)(cid:4666)(cid:1872) (cid:2880)(cid:3017)(cid:3010) (cid:4667) , which represents Apple mobility data at before policy implementation . (cid:2009)(cid:481) (cid:2010) are the coefficient of the regression model , and (cid:2013) represents the error value . Now we can find the abnormal return mobility at a given policy ( (cid:2006) (cid:4666)(cid:3043)(cid:4667) ) . (cid:3)(cid:2006) is the difference between the actual mobility data and the expected return . (cid:3)(cid:1833)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) (cid:3) is the Google mobility data .

CAR determines the total of all the abnormal return mobility on a given interval . We use the interval : (cid:1842)(cid:1835) (cid:3404) (cid:4670)(cid:1842)(cid:1830) (cid:3398) (cid:884)(cid:882)(cid:481) (cid:1842)(cid:1830) (cid:3397) (cid:883)(cid:882)(cid:4671)(cid:484) (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:1829)(cid:1827)(cid:1844) (cid:3404)(cid:3)(cid:963) (cid:2006) (cid:4666)(cid:3043)(cid:4667) (cid:3017)(cid:3005)(cid:2878)(cid:2869)(cid:2868)(cid:3017)(cid:3005)(cid:2879)(cid:2870)(cid:2868) (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:4666)(cid:885)(cid:4667)(cid:3) Let the Average Total Abnormal Return ( Ʊ ) of a given policy is denoted as (cid:3) (cid:4666)(cid:3043)(cid:4667) where (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:1833)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) is the actual value of Google mobility data and (cid:2006) (cid:4666)(cid:3046)(cid:3030)(cid:4667) is the abnormal return mobility of school closure . School closure policy is implemented before lockdown in all countries considered in this study . Hence the average total abnormal mobility return viewed after school closure policies are implemented .

E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS A . Data We integrated four different data sources for this study . We use the Apple mobility trend report [ 12 ] , Google community mobility report [ 11 ] , and government intervention data [ 31 ] to measure mobility in seven European countries , namely , the UK , Spain , Italy , Germany , Sweden , Belgium , and Norway . These results were then integrated with COVID - 19 death data from John Hopkins University [ 32 ] . Apple mobility trend report data are available from January 13 , 2020 , and are still being updated daily . These data have three subcategories of mobility : driving , walking , and transit for each day . As all categories are helpful for our study , we add them up and use the daily average of mobility . Data for May 11 - 12 , 2020 is not available on the Apple mobility dataset . Hence , we use a moving average of the previous two days to fill the data gap . 3 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply . Google community mobility data is available from February 15 , 2020 – May 29 , 2020 . This dataset has six subcategories of mobility : retail and recreation ; grocery and pharmacy ; parks ; transit station ; workplace , and residential . In our study , we use the daily average of all categories except the grocery and pharmacy subcategories . We exclude this subcategory because a reasonable amount of movement toward groceries and pharmacies is essential and is not banned by both policies . The Apple and Google datasets measure mobility changes based on baseline movement . For Google , the baseline movement is the median mobility of five weeks , January 3 – February 6 , 2020 , and Apple uses January 13 , 2020 , data as a baseline . To match the dates of the two datasets , we use data between February 15 , 2020 , and May 29 , 2020 , only . The data on school closure and lockdown interventions are from ACAPS Government Measures Dataset [ 31 ] and Ferguson et al . [ 23 ] . In the case of Sweden , we consider their partial school closure date of secondary school as the school closure intervention . Italy , one of the first EU countries hit by COVID - 19 , began implementing intervention measures on March 5 . Spain , Germany , Norway , and Belgium followed Italy and applied their school closure and / or lockdown measures between the 11th and 14th of March . UK and Norway were the last countries to implement lockdown measures on March 24 . B . Results The result section presents the reduction of mobility before school closure and lockdown policies were implemented , the impact of each policy , and the combined impact of the two policies . The results presented below as school closure and lockdown refer to the initial school closure and lockdown policies implemented in the seven countries between Feb 15 , 2020 , to May 29 , 2020 . 1 ) Decreased mobility before school closure and lockdown policies . Our model ( Fig . 2a ) provides the mobility pattern if no school closure or lockdown policy was implemented for each country . Even before school closure and lockdown policies came into effect , there was an average decrease in mobility of 17 . 03 % [ 8 . 23 % - 25 . 83 ] in Spain , 15 . 25 % [ 3 . 46 % - 27 . 41 % ] in Norway , 21 % [ 3 . 97 % - 37 . 60 % ] in Belgium , 18 % [ 3 . 96 % - 24 . 49 % ] in the UK , 2 % [ - 5 . 64 % - 15 . 89 % ] in Germany , 9 . 21 % [ 5 . 56 % - 24 . 83 % ] in Sweden , and 23 . 63 % [ 17 . 34 % - 29 . 21 % ] in Italy ( Fig . 4a ) . Numbers in brackets are 95 % confident intervals . 2 ) Decrease in mobility after school closure and after lockdown policies . The decrease in mobility after the school closure was implemented is presented in Fig . 2b . Fig . 2c shows the patterns of mobility before any policy implementation , after the school closure , and after the lockdown . The after - lockdown line in Fig . 2c is the same as the Google mobility data . Also , Sweden did not implement a lockdown in the timeframe covered in this study . Thus , the line presented as after - school closure in Fig . 2b is the same as the Google mobility data . Both the school closure and lockdown policies in Italy have , on average , reduced mobility by 5 % and 26 . 54 % , respectively . In the UK , school closure caused a 7 . 74 % drop in average mobility , while the lockdown caused a 15 . 38 % decrease . German mobility data show a 15 . 63 % decrease in mobility due to school closure . The lockdown policy in Germany was not as effective as school closure , yielding an impact of only a 3 . 74 % reduction in mobility . The only country in this study in which school closure did not cause any effect on mobility in Belgium . However , the lockdown in Belgium brought a 19 % decrease in mobility . Both school closures and the lockdown did not work very well in Norway . Mobility increased by 4 . 71 % after the lockdown in Norway , while school closure didn ' t cause any change in mobility . On the other hand , the reduction in mobility due to school closure and the lockdown in Spain was almost equal , 19 . 94 % and 21 . 71 % , respectively . Sweden is the only European country with a very light - touch mitigation policy compared to other member states . Sweden did not implement a lockdown policy , and school closure was mandated only in secondary schools . Sweden ' s mobility data support the claim that mobility did not significantly change during the pandemic . Even after the partial school closure policy , mobility increased by 2 . 91 % . Table 1 presents the RMSE of the proposed method . 3 ) Cumulative impact of school closure and lockdown on mobility Almost immediately after the school closure and lockdown policies are implemented , a significant decrease in mobility is observed in all countries except Sweden . Total abnormal return results ( Fig . 3a ) show the total mobility change between the model prediction , assuming no school closure and lockdown policies , and the actual data . Spain recorded the highest mobility decrease caused by school closure and lockdown , followed by Italy , UK , Germany , and Belgium . There was a slight decrease in mobility at the beginning of the two policies in Norway . However , mobility began to rise after April 15 , 2020 . Sweden was the outlier in this case . No mobility pattern change was observed in Sweden before and after the partial school closure . The CAR ( Fig . 3b ) results show the cumulative effect of the 20 days before school closure and the ten days after school closure . The impact of the lockdown was also included in this graph , as most countries took the lockdown measure within ten days of implementing school closure ( excluding Norway ) . Spain recorded the highest CAR ( 375 . 59 % ) of mobility ten days after school closure . There was a 145 . 29 % decrease in mobility ten days after the school closure policy in Italy . Germany , the UK , Belgium , and Norway have recorded 164 . 20 % , 179 . 18 % , 152 . 55 % , and 68 . 91 % CAR , respectively . Sweden once again was an outlier and recorded a 41 . 66 % increase in mobility after their partial school closure . The seen increase in mobility after secondary school closure may be triggered by the mobility of students whose schools were closed . 4 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE .

These countries had more than 14 , 500 COVID - 19 - related deaths a month after the school closure . On the other hand , Belgium , Norway , and Sweden had less than 10 COVID - 19 - related deaths when implementing school closures , and there were less than 3 , 600 COVID - 19 - related deaths a month after their respective school closure policy . Norway was the only country that took the school closure policy . There was no COVID - 19 - related recorded death within the country , and there were only 119 COVID - 19 - related deaths a month after the school closure policy . On the first day of the lockdown policy , the number of COVID - 19 related recorded deaths in Italy , the UK , and Spain was 827 , 508 , and 195 , respectively . A month after the lockdown , the number of COVID - 19 - related recorded deaths was 18 , 279 in Italy , 21 , 060 in the UK , and 17 , 209 in Spain . COVID - 19 - related deaths on the first day of the lockdown policy in Germany 94 , Norway was 12 , and Belgium was 3 . There were 4 , 827 deaths , 187 deaths , and 4 , 862 deaths in Belgium , Norway , and Germany , respectively , a month after the lockdown . The longest day between the school closure policy and the lockdown was 11 days in Norway , while the shortest was one day in Spain . It took 16 days and 19 days , respectively , since the first confirmed death to introduce the school closure and then the lockdown measures in the UK , while in Norway , it only took zero days and 11 days ( Fig . 4c ) .

Upper and lower are 95 % confidence intervals . V . D ISCUSSION The COVID - 19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges for government officials to implement policies with severe socio - economic consequences . Quantifying and measuring the impact of these policies is one of many challenges during the pandemic , especially at its initial stage . School closure and lockdown have emerged as major non - clinical interventions during the COVID - 19 pandemic . We document school closure and lockdown interventions , including their order and timing . We then apply the proposed method to measure their impact using mobility data . 6 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply .

Thus , it may be concluded that a substantial share of the decline in mobility was not only generated by strong interventions such as school closures and lockdown . This implies that there was a great deal of contribution by other non - clinical interventions which were implemented prior to the lockdown and school closures . Ferguson et al . similarly found that COVID - 19 transmission declined after the implementation of social distancing , self - isolation , and public events ban interventions – which were implemented before school closure and lockdown [ 23 ] . Based on our proposed method , on average , mobility decreased by 7 . 5 % due to the initial school closure and 13 . 61 % due to the initial lockdown across the countries investigated in this study . Among the countries , Sweden had the lowest mobility reduction , while Spain had the highest mobility reduction . This result is supported by Nouvellet et al . [ 33 ] . Other studies agree that the lockdown policy has a larger impact on reducing COVID - 19 transmission than school closure [ 23 , 24 ] . Our model also suggests that school closure and lockdown policies that occurred earlier in the pandemic stage significantly influenced mobility . For instance , Belgium and Norway recorded 15 fatalities by COVID - 19 while implementing lockdown . As a result , they managed to decrease the total number of deaths during the pandemic . There were 5 , 014 deaths a month after the lockdown in Belgium and Norway . On the other hand , the UK , Italy , and Spain had 1 , 530 recorded deaths until they took lockdown measures . A month after the lockdown , the total fatality number was 56 , 548 . Giordano et al . also supports the early implementation of mitigation policies [ 25 , 34 ] . Similarly , countries that took measures soon after the first fatality was recorded were in a better position than those who delayed . There is also evidence that taking lockdown measures too late will decrease the degree of compliance by the population . Early actions often transmit a clear message regarding the sensitivity and urgency of a policy . Also , a longer wait time between school closure and lockdown leads to more negative outcomes . For instance , the lockdown measure in Norway was not as strong as in other countries because there was an 11 - day gap between the implementation of the two interventions . A more extended period with school closure but without lockdown will encourage students to go out and , as a result , mobility increases . Italy , the UK , Belgium , and Spain are the countries that benefited most from the initial school closure 7 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE .

CONCLUSION Our findings show that the first school closure and lockdown policies have substantially impacted reducing COVID - 19 transmission . The magnitude of the impact of these policies varies among countries . Overall , we find that the lockdown has nearly doubled the impact on the mobility of the school closure . This implies that the implementation of school closure policies by itself cannot be used as a replacement for the lockdown policy . We also observed a significant decline in movement before the introduction of the initial school closure and lockdown . The initial school closure and lockdown policies decreased a substantial amount of mobility in countries at a more advanced stage of the pandemic compared to countries at an earlier stage . Also , countries with a shorter gap between the first lockdown and school closure implementation showed a higher percentage of overall mobility reduction . Finally , COVID - 19 - related fatalities were significantly lower in countries that took school closure and lockdown measures at the earliest stage of the epidemic than those that waited long . Thus , our study strongly supports the consecutive introduction of school closure and lockdown policies as early as possible amid a pandemic in any country to prevent unessential travel , thereby reducing COVID - 19 - related cases and deaths .
