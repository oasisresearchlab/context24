A Talin Homologue of Dictyostelium Rapidly Assembles at the Leading Edge of Cells in Response to Chemoattractant Martina Kreitmeier , Giinther Gerisch , Christina Heizer , and Annette Miiller - Taubenberger Max - Planck - Institut fOr Biochemie , 82152 Martinsried , Germany Abstract . In an attempt to identify unknown actin - binding proteins in cells of Dictyostelium discoideum that may be involved in the control of cell motility and chemotaxis , monoclonal antibodies were raised against proteins that had been enriched on an F - actin affinity matrix . One antibody recognized a protein distin - guished by its strong accumulation at the tips of filo - pods . These cell - surface extensions containing a core of bundled actin filaments are rapidly protruded and retracted by cells in the growth - phase stage . The pro - tein of 269 kD turned out to resemble mouse fibro - blast talin ( Rees et al . , 1990 ) in its primary structure . The fit is best among the first 400 - amino acid residues of the NH2 - terminal region where identity be - tween the two proteins is 44 % and the last 200 - amino acid residues of the COOH - terminal region with 36 % identity . In the elongated cells of the aggregation stage the Dictyostelium talin is accumulated at the entire front where also F - actin is enriched . Since this protein exists in a soluble state in the cytoplasm , mechanisms are predicted that cause accumulation at sites of the cell where a front is established . Evidence for receptor - mediated accumulation was obtained by local stimulation of cells with cAMP . When a new front was induced by the chemoattractant , the talin accumu - lated there within half a minute , indicating a signal cascade in Dictyostelium responsible for assembly of the talin beneath sites of the plasma membrane where chemoattractant receptors are strongly activated . The ordered assembly of the talin homologue together with actin and a series of other proteins is considered to play a key role in chemotactic orientation . C ELLS of Dictyostelium discoideum are highly motile and chemotactically responsive , resembling in size and behavior most closely the polymorphonuclear granulocytes of the mammalian organism . During locomo - tion of Dictyostelium cells their microfilament and microtu - bule systems are rapidly reorganized , which allows these ceils to change polarity and direction of movement within seconds either spontaneously or in response to gradients of chemoattractant . Organization of the microfilament system in Dictyostelium cells is based on actin filaments that by a variety of associated proteins are cross - linked into networks or bundles ( Condeelis , 1992 , 1993 ) and are attached to the plasma membrane ( Chia et al . , 1993 ; Hitt et al . , 1994 ) . Sta - ble structures like the actin cables of fibroblasts or the pro - tein complexes assembled at sites of focal adhesion are not found in Dictyostelium cells ; these structures might not be compatible with the dynamics of the microfilament system . In addition to motor proteins of the myosin family , more than 20 actin - binding proteins from D . discoideum cells have been characterized ( Schleicher and Noegel , 1992 ) . Some of them show high F - actin cross - linking , capping , severing , or Address all correspondence to G . Gerisch , Max - Planck - Institut fiir Bio - chemic , 82152 Martinsried , Germany .

G - actin sequestering activity in vitro , others are distin - guished by their functions in vivo as evidenced by pheno - typic changes in gene - replacement mutants . Up to three actin - binding proteins known to exhibit strong activities in vitro have been eliminated in D . discoideum cells , including the two major F - actin cross - linking proteins a - actinin and 120 - kD gelation factor , and the F - actin frag - menting protein severin . Although mutants lacking some or all of these proteins show alterations in cell behavior or mul - ticellular development ( Schleicher et al . , 1988 ; Andr6 et al . , 1989 ; Brink et al . , 1990 ; Witke et al . , 1992 ; Cox et al . , 1992 ) , their cells are still capable of moving towards chemoattractant ( Gerisch et al . , 1993 ) . Even in a myosin II null background elimination of the three actin - binding pro - teins does not extinguish motility and chemotactic respon - siveness ( Wallraff , E . , and G . Gerisch , unpublished results ) . Therefore , it is questionable to extrapolate from marked ac - tivities measured in vitro to the importance of a cytoskeletal protein within a living cell . Results obtained with mutants defective in coronin are consistent with this notion . This actin - binding protein has been identified by its coprecipitation with actin - myosin com - plexes . Coronin would have escaped detection by standard activity assays since it does not show obvious effects on actin polymerization or crosslinkage , neither in fluorescent nor viscometry assays ( De Hostos et al . , 1991 ) .

As a result of these findings , we decided to screen for new proteins of D . discoideum that may be involved in the con - trol of cell motility and chemotaxis by using affinity to actin as the basic criterion for proteins of potential interest . Start - ing with a triple mutant avoided the masking of proteins to be discovered by the major actin - binding proteins that are al - ready known . Here we report on a new protein that is of in - terest for two reasons : it transiently assembles with the microfilament system at specific loci of the cells , and it is related to talin of mouse fibroblasts . Materials and Methods Growth of Dictyostelium Cells D . discoideum AX2 wild type and mutant HG1397 cells were grown axeni - cally at 23°C in liquid nutrient medium ( Watts and Ashworth , 1970 ) on a gyratory shaker at 150 revs / min as described by Malchow et ai . ( 1972 ) . The cells were harvested during exponential growth at a density of not more than 5 x 106 per ml , washed , and starved in 17 mM K / Na phosphate buffer , pH 6 . 0 , on the shaker in suspension at a density of 1 x 107 cells per ml to initi - ate development . F - Actin Affinity Chromatography Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle according to Spudich and Watt ( 1971 ) followed by gel filtration on Sephacryl S 300 , and an F - actin column was prepared essentially as described by Miller and Alberts ( 1989 ) . To identify Dictyostelium actin - binding proteins , growth - phase cells of mu - tant HG1397 were washed twice in 17 mM K / Na phosphate buffer , pH 6 . 0 , and lysed in homogenization buffer ( 30 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 2 mM DTT , 4 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATE 30 % wt / vol of sucrose and protease inhibitors ; Barth et al . , 1994 ) by nitrogen excavation in a Parr bomb after equilibration at 900 psi for 15 min . The 100 , 000 g supernatant of the extract was applied to the F - actin column . After washing of the column with A buffer ( 50 mM Hepes / KOH , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 05 % Nonidet P - 40 , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 2 mM DTT , supplemented with 10 # g / ml leupeptin , 10 # g / ml pepstatin , and 10 # g / ml aprotinin ) , the bound proteins were eluted with A buffer contain - ing first 1 mM ATP and subsequently 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 , and 1 M KCI . Monoclonal Antibody Production , Immunofluorescence , and Scanning Electron Microscopy Monoclonai antibodies were raised by injecting BALB / c mice using Alngel S ( Serva , Heidelberg Germany ) as an adjuvant against the pooled fraction of proteins eluted from the F - actin column . Spleen cells were fused with PAIB3Ag8 - myeloma cells , and antibody 169 - 477 - 5 , designated here as mAb 477 , was identified in hybridoma culture supernatant by immunoblot - ting of homogenate and immunofluorescent labeling of D . discoideum growth - phase cells . For fluorescent labeling , growth - phase or aggregation competent cells were seeded on glass coverslips and allowed to attach for 45 rain . Cells were fixed either for 10 rain with methanol at - 20°C , or for 30 min with a mix - ture of 15 % ( vol / vol ) of saturated picric acid in water and 1 or 2 % of paraformaldehyde , 10 mM Pipes - HCl , pH 6 . 0 , at room temperature . After picric acid / formaldehyde fixation , cells were postfixed with 70 % ethanol . Fixed cells were washed three times for 5 rain in PBS , pH 7 . 4 , supplemented with 0 . 75 % glycine , twice for 15 rain in PBG ( 0 . 5 % BSA and 0 . 045 % fish gelatine in PBS ) and incubated overnight with mAb 477 hybridoma culture supernatant . After washing six times with PBG the cells were incubated for 1 b with affinity - purified goat anti - mouse IgG ( Dianova , Hamburg , Ger - many ) either conjugated with TRITC ( diluted 1 : 200 ) or with Cy3 ( diluted 1 : 2 , 000 ) . For comparison , cells were labeled with affinity purified poly - clonal antibodies against 30 - kD actin - bundling protein ( courtesy of Dr . M . Fecbheimer ) followed by FITC - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG ( Dianova ) . F - actin was labeled after picric acid / formaldehyde fixation with FITC - conjugated phalloidin ( Sigma Chem . Co . , St . Louis , MO ) . After washing twice with PBG and three times with PBS , the labeled cells were embedded in Gelvatol ( Polyvinyl alcohol , type II ; Sigma Chem . Co . , St . Louis , MO ) containing 2 . 5 ttg / ml of DABCO Oanssen , Beerse , Belgium ) and photographed with an Axiophot fluorescence microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) . Confocal images were obtained with an LSM 410 laser scanning microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) using a 100x objective of aperture 1 . 3 . The images were recorded with a voxel size of 0 . 083 / ~ m in the x and y axes , and 0 . 3 / ~ m in the z axis . For the printouts the images were smoothed by subdividing the pixels and linear interpolation . For scanning electron microscopy , cells spread on glass were fixed with glutaraldehyde / osmic acid and prepared by critical point drying as de - scribed by Claviez et al . ( 1986 ) . Chemotactic Stimulation Chemotaxis experiments were performed essentially as described by Gerisch and Keller ( 1981 ) . D . discoideum AX2 cells were starved for 6 h and transferred onto glass coverslips with an engraved grid ( CELLocate ; Eppendorf , Hamburg , Germany ) in 17 mM K / Na phosphate buffer and pho - tographed at intervals on an Axiovert microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) . Cells were stimulated with glass micropipettes filled with 1 x 10 - . 4 M cyclic AMP , fixed during reorientation with picric acid / formaldehyde followed by etha - nol , and labeled with mAb 477 . DNA Cloning and Sequencing A summary of the clones used to compile the complete coding sequence is presented in Fig . 1 . First , a hgtl 1 eDNA library ofD . discoideum growth - phase cells ( Graham et al . , 1988 ) ( courtesy Dr . A . Kaplan , Washington University , School of Medicine St . Louis , MO ) was screened with 125I - labeled mAb 477 . This screen identified one 1 . 3 - kb clone , ~ 11 . Total ex - tract of the Escherichia coli induced by IPTG and subjected to SDS - PAGE showed after immunoblotting with mAb 477 a single band corresponding to the ~ - gal hcl I fusion protein , which was not seen in non - induced bacte - ria . The kcl I insert was used to roscreen the library resulting in clones of slightly larger size . One of them was used to screen a genomic library ( Giorda et al . , 1990 ) ( courtesy Dr . H . L . Ennis , Roche Institute , Nufley , NJ ) , from which clones 24 - 5 and 16g were obtained . Since use of the 5 ' end of the sequence for screening failed to identify clones containing addi - tional sequences , a PCR - based strategy was adopted to walk towards the 5 ' end of the gene . A genomic map was constructed using ECL - labeled ( Amersham Corp . Arlington Heights , IL ) or 32p - labeled clone 24 - 5 to identify restriction sites in the 5 ' direction that were several kilobases apart . This information was used for inverted and subsequently for direct PCR . For inverted PCR , 2 / ~ g of genomic DNA was digested with appropriate enzymes and religated , added to a standard 100 / ~ 1 PCR cocktail containing 100 pM of each se - quence - specific primer . After 30 cycles of amplification under standard conditions in a thermocycler ( Perkin Elmer Corp . , Branchburg , NJ ) the re - action product was purified via QIAquick - spin PCR purification kit ( Quia - gen Inc . , Chatsworth , CA ) , digested with restriction enzymes and cloned into pUC19 ( Yanisch - Peron et al . , 1985 ) . The appropriate restriction sites were deduced from Southern analysis or introduced via the primers used for the PCR reactions . Presence of the internal restriction sites predicted , the expected length of the PCR clones obtained , and identity of the sequence at the region overlapping with the previous clone were criteria to identify the correct DNA fragments . DNA double strands were sequenced using the dideoxy chain termina - tion method ( Sanger et al . , 1977 ) and T7 polymerase sequencing kit ( Phar - macia , Uppsala , Sweden ) . All portions of the coding region were sequenced in both directions using oligonucleotide primers derived from the sequence . For each PCR step , two independent clones were sequenced . The sequence was analyzed using the FASTA and BESTFIT programs of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group Software ( Devereux et al . , 1984 ) and the MIPSX database ( Max - Planck - Institut , Martinsried , Germany ) . Nucleic Acid Hybridization For Southern blots , genomic DNA was prepared according to Mehdy et al . ( 1983 ) , restricted with appropriate enzymes and electrophoresed in 0 . 8 % agarose gels . After denaturation the gel was neutralized with 0 . 5 M Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 1 . 5 M NaCI . The DNA was transferred to nylon membrane ( Pall Biodyne , East Hills , NY ) in 20 × SSC ( 3 M NaCl , 0 . 3 M Na - citrate ) , and cross - linked to the membrane on a transilluminator for 2 rain . DNA was hybridized using either me ECL system ( Amersham Corp . ) or nick - translated probes in buffer containing 50 % formamide at 37°C .

Axenieally grown cells were washed in 17 mM phosphate buffer , pH 6 . 0 , and either transferred onto HABG nitrocellulose filters ( Millipore Corp . , Bedford , MA ) for development , or starved in suspension up to the aggregation - competent stage . RNA blots were probed with clones 24 - 5 , 3b and 65 - 1 ( Fig . 1 ) , Results A Protein ThatAccumulates at the Tip of Filopods in Growth - phase Cells A cytosolic fraction was prepared from HG1397 , a triple mu - tant lacking three major actin - binding proteins that have strong F - actin cross - linking or fragmenting activity in vitro : o ~ - actinin , 120 - kD gelation factor , and severin ( Schindl et al . , 1995 ) . Proteins of this fraction were applied to a phaUoidin - stabilized F - actin column . Bound proteins were eluted with ATP and KCI and used to immunize mice for monoclonal antibody production . The antibodies raised were assayed by immunoblotting of total cellular proteins separated by SDS - PAGE , and screened by immunofluores - cence microscopy for reactivity with proteins that have a pe - culiar location within the cortical network of actin filaments . Among the antibodies obtained , some reacted with a 30 - kD actin - bundling protein ( p 30 ) known to be accumulated in filopods and in the actin - rich front region of D . discoideum cells ( Fechheimer , 1987 ) , indicating that the search for anti - bodies against actin - binding proteins was efficient . One anti - body , mAb 477 ( Fig . 2 A ) , reacted specifically with a single protein band above the 200 - kD position which was hardly distinguishable from that of myosin II heavy chains . Since in mutants that lack myosin II or express truncated heavy chains , the mAb 477 reactive band remained unchanged , it became obvious that the antibody recognized a yet un - identified protein . When homogenate of growth - phase cells was fractionated about 60 % of the protein was recovered in the 100 , 000 g supernatant . Immunofluorescence labeling of methanol - fixed growth - phase cells with mAb 477 revealed a pattern distinct from that of any known Dictyostelium protein . The label was strongly accumulated in fluorescent spots at the tiny tips of filopodial cell - surface extensions ( Fig . 2 B and D ) . Some - times the antibody label was also enriched along the length of filopods . Because of its conspicuous accumulation in flit - pods we had provisionally designated the protein as " filo - podin " ( Gerisch et al . , 1993 ) . In addition to its strong accumulation in cell - surface ex - tensions a uniform labeling of filopodin in the entire cyto - plasm was observed , in accord with the presence of the pro - tein in the cytosolic fraction . The actin - bundling protein known to be enriched in filopods ( Fechheimer , 1987 ) did not show up at their tips ( Fig . 2 , C and E ) and labeling with phalloidin ( Fig . 2 F ) illustrated that F - actin is much more abundant in structures of the cell cortex other than the mAb 477 - labeled ones . Therefore , it is not just binding to actin filaments which determines positioning of the protein recog - nized by this antibody . The Protein Enriched in Filopods Is a Dictyostelium Homologue of Talin Screening of an expression library with rnAb 477 revealed a cDNA clone encompassing an open reading frame for a polypeptide of 47 kD . The antibody specifically recognized in E . coli a / 3 - gal fusion protein that migrated as a 180 - kD polypeptide in SDS - PAGE . According to the sequence de - duced from the cDNA , the cloned fragment exhibited simi - larities to the COOH - terminal region of mouse talin ( Rees et al . , 1990 ) . To obtain the complete sequence of filopodin additional clones were identified using the initial clone to re - probe cDNA and genomic libraries in combination with a PCR - based strategy to walk in the 5 ' direction . The derived amino - acid sequence of filopodin is shown in Fig . 3 . Alignment of this sequence with that of mouse talin shows that these two sequences are 46 % similar and 24 % identical as averaged over their entire lengths . The fit is best for the amino - terminal 400 - amino acid residues that are 66 % similar and 44 % identical , and for the carboxy - ter - minal 200 - amino acid residues that axe 52 % similar and 36 % identical ( Fig . 4 , top ) . The central regions show weaker relationship with 40 % similarity and 19 % identity . The predicted relative molecular mass of the polypeptide is 268 , 810 D , which is larger than 220 kD on SDS - PAGE . A similar difference has been found for mouse talin and is probably due to its amino - acid composition . The amino acid compositions of the Dictyostelium protein and mouse talin are similar ; the alanine content of both proteins is high , 13 and 18 % , respectively . The calculated isoelectric points of the two proteins , 6 . 05 and 6 . 10 , are almost identical . The sec - ondary structure prediction suggests a high content of or - helices for the central domain of the Dictyostelium pro - tein , as for the rod domain of mouse talin . This is consistent with the finding that chicken gizzard talin has a high content of or - helices ( Molony et al . , 1987 ) . Because of its similarities to the talin from mouse fibroblasts , we henceforth refer to filopodin as Dictyostelium talin .

The COOH - terminal half of the Dictyostelium sequence is homologous to the sla2 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae , as is the COOH - terminal portion of mouse talin ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) . Sla2 is a 109 - kD protein of the actin skeleton required for normal cytokinesis of the yeast . A similar protein corre - sponding to the COOH - terminal half of mouse fibroblast and Dictyostelium talin has also been found in Caenorhabditis ( Fig . 4 , bottom ) . Genomic Southern blots probed with clones covering the entire coding region indicated that the Dictyostelium talin is encoded by a single gene , talA . Northern blots hybridized with different clones of the coding sequence recognized a single transcript of 8 kb , which was detected during growth and aggregation , and in the slug and culmination stages at roughly the same amounts .

Comparison of the Dictyostelium talin sequence ( D . d ) with the NH2 - terminal and COOH - terminal regions of mouse talin ( M . m ) , and with the COOH - terminal regions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sla2p ( S . c . ) and a Caenorhabditis elegans protein ( Waterston , R . , accession number M98552 ) ( Ce . ) . Similarities of the two NHz - terminal sequences are most abundant in the stretch between residues 295 . and 399 of the mouse sequence . In the Dic - tyostelium protein , a stretch of 37 - amino acid residues correspond - ing to positions 131 to 167 of the mouse sequence is missing . Iden - tical residues are indicated by lines , similar residues by double and single dots according to the algorithm of the UWGCG BESTFIT program . explored accumulation of the Dictyostelium homologue in filopods attached or non - attached to a substratum . Accurate images of the pattern of immunolabeling in growth - phase cells were obtained by confocal microscopy after fixation of the cells with a mixture of picric acid and formaldehyde , which preserves the shape of D . discoideum cells more reli - ably than methanol does and allows satisfactory labeling with most of the antibodies we have tested ( Brink , 1989 ; De Hostos et al . , 1991 , 1993b ) . Fig . 5 ( A to F ) shows confocal sections of a growth - phase cell where exensions of the cell surface that are in contact with the substratum can be distin - guished from extensions that are free . Strong labeling is rec - ognized at the tips of both extensions , indicating that it is not the contact with a surface that induces the talin to assemble . To estimate the extent of talin accumulation in the filopod tips , the size of the thin , tapered fllopods has to be related to the size of the diffraction patterns that limit optical resolu - tion . In fact , the scanning electron micrograph of Fig . 5 G illustrates that the diameters of filopods are smaller than the diameters of their optical representations in the confocal sec - tions A , E , or E The false color code in these scans indicates that the brightness in the pixels over the bulk cytoplasm and the filopod tips is about the same . The tip diameter of the filopods is about 150 nm ( Claviez et al . , 1986 ) . Under the conditions of confocal microscopy used the size of an optical resolution element is 0 . 25 x 0 . 25 # m in the x and y axes , and about 0 . 8 # m in the z direction . From these data a 14 - fold higher fluorescence intensity in the small volume of the filo - pod tips than in the bulk cytoplasm is calculated , which means that the talin is enriched in the tips by more than one order of magnitude . Filopods are extended and retracted in Dictyostelium cells in periods of less than a minute ( Gerisch , 1964 ) . Because of its rapid , strictly localized , and reversible accumulation , Dictyostelium talin can be taken as a marker for the reorgani - zation of the actin skeleton that occurs during changes in cell shape and locomotion . Chemoattractant Induces Local Talin Accumulation in Aggregating Dictyostelium Cells During a starvation period of about 6 h , cells of D . dis - coideum develop from the growth phase to the aggregation - competent stage . In the course of preaggregative devel - opment , the cells not only express new proteins which are involved in aggregation , e . g . , the csA cell - adhesion protein ( Gerisch , 1987 ) , but also change their shape and motility be - havior . Relevant to this paper is the chemotactic responsive - ness of aggregating cells to cAMP which is due to the de - velopmentally regulated expression of the cAR1 type of cAMP receptors ( Klein et al . , 1987 ) and the 0 ~ 2 subunit of G proteins ( Pupillo et al . , 1989 ; Kumagai et al . , 1991 ) . Expression of the talin in Dictyostelium proved not to be under developmental control , but its distribution became al - tered when the cells acquired , with the onset of aggregation , the capability to assume a strongly elongated cylindrical shape . In this polarized state the cells possess a well circum - scribed front and only few filopods along their length . In the elongated cells of the aggregation stage , the talin was accu - mulated in the entire front region . This localization was par - ticularly evident when the cells had started to aggregate into streams by end - to - end contacts ( Fig . 6 , A - D ) . In the mul - ticellular slug the protein formed a cap on one end of the ceils which probably pointed into the direction of movement ( Fig . 6 , E and F ) . By local stimulation with cAMP through a micropipette , the polarity of aggregation - competent D . discoideum cells can be changed at will ( Gerisch et al . , 1975 ; Swanson and Taylor , 1982 ) . One or two new fronts are elicited at the site of strongest stimulation , while the previous front is para - lysed ( Segall and Gerisch , 1989 ) . To study redistribution of the talin during chemotactic orientation , we have recorded aggregation - competent cells at intervals before and during their stimulation through a micropipette , and finally have fixed and labeled them with antibody to visualize the talin at early phases of reorientation . Two examples of chemotactically responding cells are shown in Fig . 7 . In both cases a new front was induced to - wards the micropipette at the flank of the cells , where nor - mally no distinct accumulation of the talin is found . After about half a minute of stimulation the new fronts were bril - liantly labeled with the anti - talin antibody , much stronger than any other part of the cells including the previous front region .

Strong labeling of the talin at the lead - ing edges of aggregating cells is shown to be independent of the type of fixation ( A , C ) . In slug cells the talin is enriched in caps which coincide with hyaline regions free of organelles ( E , F ) . The bar in - dicates 10 # m . Discussion " Ihlin of vertebrate cells is a dumbbell - shaped antiparallel homodimer ( Goldmann et al . , 1994 ) . The polypeptide se - quence indicates three regions in each subunit : an NH ~ - terminal head segment of about 47 kD which can be cleaved off by calpaln II , a central region with high t ~ - belix forming capacity , and a COOH - terminal domain which is rich in charged amino acids . The sequence of the central region in - dicates a weakly periodic pattern of a - helical motifs that pre - sumably form a tightly packed hydrophobic central strand , thus giving rise to the rod shape of the molecule ( McLachlan et al . , 1994 ) . In fihroblasts , talin is part of a complex of proteins assem - bled at sites of focal contact to anchor actin cables to inte - grins . Together with talin a number of soluble proteins in - cluding vinculin and a - actinin are assembled in the adhesion plaques ( Burridge et al . , 1988 ; Beckerle and Yeh , 1990 ; Gei - ger et al . , 1990 ) . The NH2 - terminal head domain of mouse talin shows sequence similarities to the spectrin - binding pro - tein band 4 . 1 of erythrocytes ( Conboy et al . , 1986 ) and to ezrin from microvilli ( Gould et al . , 1989 ) . Since these pro - teins are linked to the plasma membrane , talin has been pro - posed to contain a membrane - binding site that is located in the head domain . In fact , direct evidence has been provided for binding of the NIq ~ - terminal domain of platelet talin to acidic phospholipids ( Niggli et al . , 1994 ) . Integrin - and vinculin - binding sites have been mapped to the rod region ( Horwitz et al . , 1986 ; Gilmore et al . , 1993 ) . For the binding of talin to actin , which is of low affinity , the head domain is also not required ( Muguruma et al . , 1990 ) . Our data provide the first evidence in a non - vertebrate cell for a full - length talin homologue that comprises not only the COOH - terminal region but also the NH2 - terminal domain ( Fig . 4 ) . The presence of a taiin homologue in Dictyostelium calls for a search for other adhesion plaque proteins as , for instance , vinculin , and integrins . Proteins similar to these fibroblast proteins may also in Dictyostelium form a func - tional complex together with actin . However , it is possible as well that talin has a separate function in Dictyostelium , not requiring the series of proteins present in adhesion plaques . Several observations are in line with this possibility . ~ Actinin , an actin - binding component of adhesion plaques is also present in Dictyostelium cells but does not co - accumulate with talin at the tips of filopods ( Brink , 1989 ) . In fibroblasts , talin assembles at two types of loci : first be - neath ribs of lamellipods that are rich in actin filaments , and de novo at sites of focal contact ( Burridge and Connell , 1983a , b ; DePasquale and Izzard , 1991 ) . It is conceivable that the sites of talin accumulation in Dictyostelium are equivalent to the first type in fibroblasts , whereas the second type is missing . Even during the formation of adhesion plaques in fibroblasts , talin does not need vinculin in order to find its position , which means the accumulation of talin precedes that of vinculin . The Dictyostelium homologue of talin we have identified proved to be a soluble cytoplasmic protein that transiently associates with the cytoskeleton during cell locomotion . Control of this association by chemoattractant was demon - strated by locally stimulating ceils in the early aggregation stage with cAMP . This stimulation elicits a new leading edge followed by suppression of the previous one . After less than a minute of stimulation strong accumulation of the talin was found at the now front . Two principal questions are raised by these findings : how does the talin become located to the tips of filopods or , in aggregating cells , to the leading edge and , second , what is its function there ? Talin is the only known Dictyostelium protein that is localized to the tips of filopods . Other proteins that transiently associate with the actin cortex in Dictyostelium ceils either bind to cell surface extensions of any shape , like coronln ( De Hostos et al . , Kreitmeier et al . Talin Homologue in Dictyostelium 185 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 129 , 1995 186 1991 ) , or ABP50 ( Dharmawardhane et al . , 1991 ) , or they as - semble along the length of the filopods , like the 30 - kD actin - bundling protein ( Fechheimer , 1987 ) . Based on these data we propose that the talin homologue of Dictyostelium con - tains a particular recognition site for signals that precisely target the protein to its assembly position . In growth - phase cells of Dictyostelium this position is the narrow space be - tween the ends of actin bundles and the curvature of the plasma membrane ( Claviez et al . , 1986 ) . In thrombin - activated platelets changes in cell shape are accompanied by the shift from a uniform distribution to a submembranous lo - cation of talin ( Beckerle et al . , 1989 ) . This redistribution is known to be accompanied by the phosphorylation of talin ( Bertagnolli et al . , 1993 ) . If phosphorylation is a general mechanism of regulating the association of talin with other proteins ( Tidball and Spencer , 1993 ) , it may also be respon - sible in Dictyostelium for the chemoattractant - elicited re - cruitment of talin from the cytoplasm which is reminiscent of the redistribution in platelets . Analysis of the role of talin in Dictyostelium cells has to wait for gene disruption or other mutants . Nevertheless , sev - eral functions relevant to Dictyostelium are suggested by the activities of vertebrate talin . Because of its actin - and lipid - binding activity , vertebrate talin has the potential of linking actin filaments directly to membranes . As a dimer , talin is capable of bridging the barbed ends of actin filaments , and is also capable of nucleating actin filament formation ( Kauf - mann et al . , 1992 ) . These activities of talin may be relevant to the formation of filopods or , in aggregating Dictyostelium cells , to the extension of the leading edge . It appears to be important that forces generated by actin polymerization are transmitted to the membrane in order to push a filopod rap - idly out of the plane of the cell surface . If so , the bundles of growing actin filaments need to be tightly fixed at their ends to small areas of the plasma membrane , and talin might be involved in this anchorage . Evidence has been provided that nucleation of actin polymerization is important for the protrusion of a leading edge ( Condeelis , 1992 , 1993 ) . A rise in nucleating activity has been found within 5 - 10 s upon stimulation of D . discoideum cells with cAMP ( Hall et al . , 1989 ) , and more than a single protein including talin might be responsible for this increase . Finally , we wish to emphasize a technical point . The de - tection of talin in Dictyostelium demonstrates the usefulness of mutants that lack the most avid actin - binding proteins ( Schindl et al . , 1995 ) for the identification of new proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton .
