ABSTRACTBackground and objectives irtKS functions as a novel regulator of tumour suppressor p53 ; however , the role of irtKS in pathogenesis of gastric cancer is unclear . Design We used immunohistochemistry to detect irtKS levels in 527 human gastric cancer specimens . We generated both IRTKS - deficient and p53 - deficient mice to observe survival time of these mice and to isolate mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MeFs ) for evaluating in vivo tumorigenicity . co - immunoprecipitation was used to study the interaction among p53 , MDM2 and irtKS , as well as the ubiquitination of p53 . Results irtKS was significantly overexpressed in human gastric cancer , which was conversely associated with wild - type p53 expression . among patients with wild - type p53 ( n = 206 ) , those with high irtKS expression ( n = 141 ) had a shorter survival time than those with low irtKS ( n = 65 ) ( p = 0 . 0153 ) . Heterozygous p53 + / − mice with IRTKS deficiency exhibited significantly delayed tumorigenesis and an extended tumour - free survival time . p53 + / − MeFs without IRTKS exhibited attenuated in vivo tumorigenicity . irtKS depletion upregulated p53 and its target genes , such as BAX and p21 . intriguingly , irtKS overexpression promoted p53 ubiquitination and degradation in MeFs and gastric cancer cells . Under Dna damage conditions , irtKS was phosphorylated at Ser331 by the activated chk2 kinase and then dissociated from p53 , along with the p53 - specific e3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 , resulting in attenuated p53 ubiquitination and degradation . Conclusion irtKS overexpression is negatively correlated with progression and overall survival time of patients with gastric cancer with wild - type p53 through promotion of p53 degradation via the ubiquitin / proteasome pathway . InTRoDuCTIon Gastric cancer is one of the most deadly malignancy and the third most common leading cause of global cancer mortality . 1 2 This heterogeneous disease arises from the complex interplay of host factors and environmental risk agents like Helicobacter pylori , smoke , dietary habits and so on . More - over , there are emerging evidences showing that gastric cancer exhibits a wide spectrum of molec - ular aberrations . 3 Copy number amplifications may alter gene expression levels and occur frequently in gastric cancer . 4 By analysing the public The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) database , we found that genomic DNA of IRTKS is frequently amplified in human cancers related to the digestive system , espe - cially in gastric cancer . In addition , in our previous work , we found that IRTKS may function as a novel negative regulator of p53 activity through promotion of MDM2 - me - diated p53 ubiquitination and degradation in HT1080 and U2OS cells . 5 IRTKS is also frequently upregulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) and promotes HCC cell proliferation . 6 However , whether the contribution of IRTKS over - expression to the progression of human cancers is through regulation of p53 ubiquitination and degra - dation is not clear . Moreover , whether IRTKS over - expression that negatively regulates the p53 level is correlated with poor outcome in these patients with tumour should be further clarified . 1401 Huang l - Y , et al .

H & E staining of each paraffin section and subse - quent pathological diagnosis contributed to the classification of clinical samples . p53 antibody ( DO - 1 , Santa Cruz Biotech - nology , Santa Cruz , California , USA ) at a 1 : 50 dilution was used to interact with the dewaxed paraffin sections of the 527 pairs of gastric cancer samples . MICe IRTKS - knockout mice were previously generated and were housed in Shanghai Model Organisms Center . 7 Heterozy - gous IRTKS mice were mated with heterozygous p53 mice ( Jackson Laboratory ) to generate IRTKS + / − p53 + / − mice . Then , the IRTKS + / − p53 + / − mice were mated mutually to generate groups of mice with different genotypes . Nude mice and NOD - SCID mice were purchased from Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center , Chinese Academy of Sciences . Mice were fed with a regular diet and had free access to water and food . All the mice experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Shanghai Model Organisms Center . MouSe eMBRyonIC fIBRoBlASTS Mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) were isolated from E13 . 5 mouse embryos . PlASMIDS IRTKS S331A and S331D mutants were generated using a Quik - Change XL Site - Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Stratagene , La Jolla , California , USA ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . AnTIBoDIeS Anti - IRTKS rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated by our laboratory . Anti - p21 , anti - p53 ( DO - 1 ) , anti - Ub , anti - Chk2 and anti - actin antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , California , USA ) . Anti - p53 ( # 2524 ) , anti - cleaved caspase 3 and anti - BAX were obtained from Cell Signalling Technology ( Beverly , Massachusetts , USA ) . Anti - MDM2 and anti - phosphor - ylated Ser / Thr antibodies were from Abcam ( Cambridge , UK ) . Chk2 kinase ( # 7434 ) was from Cell Signalling Technology ( Beverly , Massachusetts , USA ) . Immunoprecipitation assay Briefly , 1 mg of cell lysates was incubated with the indicated antibodies at 4°C overnight and then incubated with protein G sepharose beads at 4°C for another 2 hours . Each immuno - precipitate was washed four times with lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris / HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 3 mM DTT , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 and protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , Missouri , USA ) ) and then analysed by immunoblotting . siRnA synthesis Two siRNAs against IRTKS were used : siRNA - 1 ( sense , 5 ′ - CCA GUC CCU UGA UCG AUA UTT - 3 ′ and anti - sense , 5 ′ - AUA UCG AUC AAG GGA CUG GTA - 3 ′ ) ; siRNA - 2 ( sense , 5 ′ - GCU UAA GCA AAU CAU GCU UTT - 3 ′ and anti - sense , 5 ′ - AAG CAU GAU UUG CUU AAG CAG - 3 ′ ) . Two siRNAs against Chk2 were used : siRNA - Chk2 - 1 ( sense , 5 ′ - GCA CGA GCU CUC ACA GUA UTT - 3 ′ and anti - sense , 5 ′ - AUA CUG UGA GAG CUC GUG CTT - 3 ′ ) ; siRNA - Chk2 - 2 ( sense , 5 ′ - GCU UAU UGG GAA AGG CAA ATT - 3 ′ and anti - sense , 5 ′ - UUU GCC UUU CCC AAU AAG CTT - 3 ′ ) . All siRNAs were designed and chemically synthesised by Shanghai GenePharma . In vitro kinase assay Briefly , 1 µ g of the indicated GST – IRTKS fusion proteins was incubated with 50 ng of commercially obtained recombinant active Chk2 kinase ( Cell Signalling Technology , # 7434 ) , in the presence of 200 µ M cold ATP in the kinase reaction buffer at 30°C for 30 min . The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS - containing lysis buffer and resolved by SDS – PAGE . The phosphorylation of GST – IRTKS was detected by anti - phosphor - ylated Ser / Thr antibody . MS analysis For MS analysis , anti - Flag immunoprecipitations ( IPs ) were performed with the whole cell lysates derived from three 10 - cm dishes of HEK293 cells co - transfected with Flag - IRTKS and HA - Chk2 . The IP proteins were resolved by SDS – PAGE and were identified by Coomassie staining . The band containing IRTKS was in - gel digested with trypsin enzymes . The resulting peptides were extracted from the gel and were resuspended with 15 µ L solvent A , respectively ( A : water with 0 . 1 % formic acid ; B : ACN with 0 . 1 % formic acid ) , separated by nano - LC and analysed by online electrospray MS / MS . The experiments were performed on an EASY - nLC 1000 system ( Thermo Fisher Scien - tific , Waltham , Massachusetts , USA ) connected to an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , San Jose , California , USA ) equipped with an online nano - electrospray ion source . MS / MS data were searched against the UniProt / Swis - sProt database ( Taxonomy : Homo sapiens , 20 199 entries ) using Mascot ( Matrix Science , London , UK ; V . 2 . 3 ) and data analysis was performed using Proteome Discoverer software ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , V . 1 . 4 . 0 . 288 ) . Peptides and modified peptides were accepted if they passed a 1 % FDR threshold . Protein half - life detection MEF cells were plated in 6 - well plates at 80 % confluence and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , California , USA ) with 10 % fetal bovine serum . After 24 hours of culture , cycloheximide ( CHX , Sigma Chemical , St Louis , Missouri , USA ) ( 100 µ g / mL ) was added . Cells were lysed in SDS buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor ( Sigma Chemical , St Louis , Missouri , USA ) after CHX treatment at the indicated time points . Cell cycle analysis MEF cells were harvested and incubated with propidium iodide ( Sigma ) ( 50 µ g / mL ) , RNase A ( 10 mg / mL ) and Triton X - 100 ( 0 . 2 % ) for 15 min at room temperature and then analysed by a FACS Calibur flow cytometer , CellQuest ( BD Biosciences , USA ) . STATISTICAl AnAlySIS Statistical evaluation of in vitro and in vivo experiments was calculated using Student’s t - test . Multiple group comparisons were analysed by one - way analysis of variance . Kaplan - Meier survival curves and log - rank ( Mantel - Cox ) tests were used for survival analysis of patients with gastric cancer and the geneti - cally engineered mice with IRTKS and p53 deficiency . Different cut - off values , p < 0 . 05 ( * ) , p < 0 . 01 ( * * ) and p < 0 . 001 ( * * * ) , were considered significant . 1402 Huang l - Y , et al . Gut 2018 ; 67 : 1400 – 1409 . doi : 10 . 1136 / gutjnl - 2016 - 313478 Stomach ReSulTS IRTKS is upregulated in human gastric cancer and correlates with poor survival in patients with wild - type p53 To explore the role of IRTKS in human tumours , we analysed TCGA database and demonstrated that the genomic DNA of IRTKS is frequently amplified in human cancers related to the digestive system , including oesophageal and gastric cancers , where genomic DNA amplification of IRTKS was found in 7 . 4 % of patients with gastric cancer ( see online supplementary figure 1 ) . We therefore examined IRTKS expression in 527 pairs of human gastric cancer samples in a tissue array . Quan - titative immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) data showed that IRTKS expression was significantly higher in 398 / 527 ( 75 . 5 % ) tumour specimens than in adjacent non - cancerous tissues ( p < 0 . 0001 ) ( figure 1A and online supplementary table ) . Higher IRTKS expression was positively correlated with progression , particu - larly in late stages , of these gastric cancer samples ( p = 0 . 029 ) ( figure 1B and online supplementary figure 2 ) . We next investigated the relationship between IRTKS expres - sion and the clinical outcome of patients with gastric cancer with different p53 status . Here , the status of p53 was characterised by IHC nuclear staining . Generally , it has been recognised that positive p53 IHC staining is largely ascribed to mutant p53 , while the expression of wild - type p53 often becomes undetect - able in gastric cancers bearing wild - type p53 . 8 – 12 Based on the above criteria , among the 527 tumour samples , 321 cases were defined as bearing mutant p53 and the remaining 206 individ - uals were defined as carrying wild - type p53 . Remarkably , higher IRTKS expression ( n = 141 vs n = 65 ) was significantly associated with poor outcome of patients with cancer carrying wild - type p53 ( log - rank test : p = 0 . 0153 ) ( figure 1C ) , although there were no significant differences in the whole cohort ( log - rank test : p = 0 . 4983 ) . While conversely in these patients with p53 mutant , better survival is observed in these patients with higher IRTKS expression although the p value was not significant ( log - rank test : p = 0 . 1773 ) ( figure 1C ) . We then performed an independent Western blotting analysis on randomly selected tumour specimens to evaluate the associ - ation of the IRTKS level with wild - type or mutant p53 . Signifi - cantly , the result showed that the IRTKS level was reversely correlated with wild - type p53 expression ( see online supplemen - tary figure 3A and B ) , although no association between IRTKS and mutant p53 level was observed ( see online supplementary figure 3C and D ) . These data suggested that IRTKS overexpres - sion could exert an important role in tumorigenesis of gastric cancer by negatively regulating wild - type p53 activity . IRTKS promotes cell proliferation in gastric cancer through downregulation of p53 To further validate the hypothesis that IRTKS may regulate wild - type p53 but not mutant p53 , we transfected three types of plasmids encoding wild - type p53 , as well as mutant p53 H179C and p53 R248W , the hotspot p53 mutants in cancer , 13 14 into p53 − / − mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) . Significantly , ectopic IRTKS could induce a more intense decrease in wild - type p53 ( 36 % remaining ) than in mutant p53 H179C and p53 R248W ( approximately 89 % and 70 % remaining ) ( figure 2A and B ) . Consistently , as shown in online supplementary figure 4 , these p53 mutants p53 H179C and p53 R248W significantly attenuated the ability to bind IRTKS , as compared with that of wild - type p53 . To explore the underlying mechanism by which IRTKS nega - tively regulates p53 , we first examined the biological function of IRTKS in the gastric cancer cell lines AGS and MKN45 , both figure 1 IRTKS is upregulated in human gastric cancer and correlates with poor survival in patients with wild - type p53 . ( A ) IRTKS expression level in 527 paired gastric tumour samples and normal tissues . The expression scoring system was based on multiplication of the IRTKS immunohistochemistry staining intensity and extent . Staining intensity was classified as 0 ( negative ) , 1 ( weak ) , 2 ( moderate ) and 3 ( strong ) . Staining extent was dependent on the percentage of positive cells ( examined in 200 cells ) and was divided as follows : 0 ( < 5 % ) , 1 ( 5 % – 25 % ) , 2 ( 26 % – 50 % ) , 3 ( 51 % – 75 % ) and 4 ( > 75 % ) . ( B ) IRTKS expression was positively correlated with late stages of gastric tumour samples . ( C ) Kaplan - Meier survival curves for 527 individuals with gastric cancer whose tumours showed negative ( IRTKS− , black ) or positive IRTKS ( IRTKS + , red ) staining . Of 527 samples , the individuals with wild - type p53 ( n = 206 ) were defined as negative nuclear staining . 8 – 12 High IRTKS ( IRTKS + ) was defined as cytoplasmic staining scores ≥4 , according to the Youden index analysis ( online supplementary figure S2A ) . 1403 Huang l - Y , et al . Gut 2018 ; 67 : 1400 – 1409 . doi : 10 . 1136 / gutjnl - 2016 - 313478 Stomach of which express wild - type p53 . As shown in online supple - mentary figure S5A and B , when IRTKS was knocked down in AGS cells , whose IRTKS expression was relatively higher , the cell growth and colony formation of AGS cells were significantly suppressed . In contrast , the forced overexpression of IRTKS could strikingly enhance cell proliferation and colony formation of MKN45 cells ( see online supplementary figure 5C and D ) . Interestingly , we found that , as IRTKS was knocked down in AGS cells , the endogenous wild - type p53 level was significantly increased ( figure 2C ) . Furthermore , the suppressed colony formation mediated by IRTKS knockdown could be partially reversed by p53 knockdown induced by shRNA lentivirus infection ( figure 2D and E ) , and these results were supported by the change in the p53 level after both IRTKS and p53 were knocked down ( figure 2C ) . Meanwhile , when IRTKS was forc - ibly overexpressed in MKN45 cells , the endogenous or ectopic wild - type p53 level was significantly reduced ( figure 2F ) , and the increased colony formation capacity induced by IRTKS over - expression was attenuated by ectopic p53 ( figure 2G and H ) . Furthermore , in vivo tumorigenesis in nude mice also indicated that IRTKS knockdown significantly inhibited xenograft tumour growth of AGS cells . However , shRNA - induced p53 knockdown could abrogate the IRTKS knockdown - reduced tumour growth ( figure 2I and J and online supplementary figure 6 ) . On the contrary , when IRTKS was knocked down or enforcedly overexpressed in the cell line BGC823 with p53 mutant , the cell growth and colony formation of BGC823 cells were not signifi - cantly changed ( see online supplementary figure 5E - H ) . These collective data suggested that IRTKS overexpression enhanced cell proliferation of gastric tumours possibly through influencing the wild - type p53 expression level . IRTKS enhances mouse tumorigenesis in a p53 - dependent manner To understand the impact of IRTKS on the role of p53 in tumour suppression in vivo , we further crossed IRTKS - knockout mice 7 with genetically inactivated p53 mice to generate various mouse genotypes . Among them , we monitored and observed six groups : p53 + / + IRTKS + / + , p53 + / + IRTKS − / − , p53 + / − IRTKS + / + , p53 + / − IRTKS − / − , p53 − / − IRTKS + / + and p53 − / − IRTKS − / − . All p53 + / + mice with or without IRTKS developed normally and had no difference in lifetime during the 24 - month observa - tion period ( figure 3A ) . All p53 − / − mice with or without IRTKS figure 2 IRTKS promotes cell proliferation in gastric cancer by negatively regulating p53 . ( A ) p53 − / − mouse embryonic fibroblast cells were transfected with the indicated IRTKS and p53 constructs . After 24 hours , the cell lysates were analysed by Western blotting . ( B ) The remaining amount of exogenous p53 was quantified by densitometry and normalised to the level of actin . ( C ) IRTKS and p53 expression levels were assessed by Western blotting . sh - IRTKS and sh - p53 were used to knock IRTKS and p53 down in AGS cells , respectively .

Data are presented as the mean ± SD * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 versus control . ( I ) The stable AGS cell lines were generated after transfection with NC , sh - IRTKS , sh - p53 or sh - p53 plus sh - IRTKS and were then injected subcutaneously into 6 - week - old nude mice . A total of 5×10 6 cells were injected for each group . After 90 days of observation , tumour growth curves were constructed . ( J ) At 90 days post injection , the tumours were collected and weighed . 1404 Huang l - Y , et al . Gut 2018 ; 67 : 1400 – 1409 . doi : 10 . 1136 / gutjnl - 2016 - 313478 Stomach also had no difference in tumour - free survival time and died around 6 months of age from lymphoma or sarcoma ( figure 3B , and online supplementary figure 7A and B ) , indicating that IRTKS deficiency could not effectively block tumorigenesis and mortality in p53 − / − mice . However , we found that p53 + / − mice lacking IRTKS ( p53 + / − IRTKS − / − ) displayed an increased median tumour - free survival ( log - rank test : p = 0 . 007 ) ( figure 3A ) . The average lifetime of the p53 + / − IRTKS − / − mice ( n = 11 ) was 20 months , significantly longer than that of p53 + / − IRTKS + / + mice ( n = 10 ) , whose average lifetime was 16 months . 15 Similar to p53 − / − mice , most of the p53 + / − mice died of lymphoma or sarcoma ( see online supplementary figure 7A and B ) , suggesting that IRTKS may contribute to tumorigenesis in the case of p53 haploinsufficiency . To confirm this observation , we further evaluated the in vivo tumorigenicity of MEFs derived from these six groups of mice ( figure 3C ) . The p53 expression level in MEFs derived from p53 + / + IRTKS − / − and p53 + / − IRTKS − / − mice was signifi - cantly increased as compared with that from p53 + / + IRTKS + / + and p53 + / − IRTKS + / + mice , respectively , where the elevated p53 expression level in p53 + / − MEF cells with IRTKS depletion was comparable to that in p53 + / + IRTKS + / + MEFs ( figure 3C ) . The MEF cells from these mice were transduced with a plasmid encoding the activated oncogene H - ras v12 and then were subcu - taneously injected into immunocompromised NOD - SCID mice . 16 As expected , the H - ras v12 - transduced p53 + / − IRTKS + / + MEFs produced tumours in mice ( figure 3D and E ) , whereas the p53 + / − IRTKS − / − MEFs did not form visible tumours 3 weeks after injection . In agreement with experiments in the genetically engineered mice , both p53 − / − IRTKS + / + and p53 − / − IRTKS − / − MEFs with ectopic H - ras v12 developed xeno - graft tumours in NOD - SCID mice , with no significant differ - ence between the two groups ( figure 3F and G ) . Meanwhile , all p53 + / + MEFs with H - ras v12 did not form tumours regardless of whether IRTKS was present ( data not shown ) , implying that genomic instability caused by p53 haploinsufficiency may be a prerequisite for the contribution of IRTKS in tumorigenesis . Together , the observation that the inhibitory effect of IRTKS deficiency on tumourigenicity exclusively occurred in p53 - hap - loinsufficient mice suggested that the contribution of IRTKS overexpression to human tumours may depend on negative regulation of wild - type p53 function . IRTKS deficiency increases cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through activation of p53 activity To further evaluate the effect of IRTKS on p53 activity , we examined specific cellular behaviours , including cell cycle and apoptosis , in the p53 - haploinsufficient MEFs or in mice . In untreated MEF cells at the same passage , we found that the cell growth of p53 + / − IRTKS − / − MEFs was remarkably slower than that of p53 + / − IRTKS + / + MEFs ( used as a control ) ( figure 4A ) . This result was further supported by the notably increased G2 / M fraction of cell cycle progression in p53 + / − IRTKS − / − MEFs ( figure 4B and C ) . Moreover , we also found that cell apoptosis was significantly higher in MEFs and in spleen and thymus tissues of p53 + / − IRTKS − / − mice than in the 2 - month - old p53 + / − IRTKS + / + littermates , as shown by annexin V labelling , figure 3 IRTKS deficiency inhibits tumorigenesis in a p53 - dependent manner .

( C ) Western blot analysis of p53 and IRTKS in the indicated mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) cells . ( D - G ) The indicated H - ras v12 - transduced MEFs ( 1×10 7 ) were subcutaneously injected into NOD - SCID mice . The mice were sacrificed 3 weeks later and the tumours were weighed . 1405 Huang l - Y , et al . Gut 2018 ; 67 : 1400 – 1409 . doi : 10 . 1136 / gutjnl - 2016 - 313478 Stomach TUNEL assay and IHC staining of cleaved caspase 3 ( figure 4D and E , online supplementary figure 8A , B ) . In the same exper - imental conditions , cell cycle distribution and apoptosis failed to show any statistical difference between p53 − / − IRTKS + / + and p53 − / − IRTKS − / − MEFs or mice ( see online supplementary figure 8A , B and see online supplementary figure 9A , B ) . These collec - tive data from p53 - haploinsufficient MEFs and mice suggested that IRTKS deficiency enhanced p53 function in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis . To confirm this hypothesis , we evaluated the p53 down - stream pathway in the p53 - haploinsufficient MEFs and mice . In agreement with the above cellular phenotypes , in the p53 + / − IRTKS − / − group , the levels of p53 protein , but not mRNA , and the downstream target genes BAX and p21 were significantly higher than those in the p53 + / − IRTKS + / + group ( figure 4F and G and online supplementary figure 8C ) . These data revealed that , in the absence of IRTKS , the p53 downstream signalling pathway was activated in p53 - haploinsufficient cells . To further evaluate the effect of IRTKS on p53 function , we performed a rescue experiment by transfecting a recombi - nant plasmid encoding IRTKS into p53 + / − IRTKS − / − MEFs to restore IRTKS expression . Interestingly , compared with the empty vector control , ectopic expression of IRTKS significantly increased cell growth of p53 + / − IRTKS − / − MEFs and decreased the p53 protein level , but not mRNA expression , as well as the levels of the downstream molecules BAX and p21 ( figure 4H - J ) . However , in the absence of p53 , ectopic IRTKS had no effect on cell proliferation or on BAX and p21 levels ( figure 4H and I ) . The data indicated that IRTKS may regulate p53 activity by affecting the p53 expression level . Furthermore , we examined p53 + / + cells and showed that cell apoptosis in p53 + / + IRTKS − / − MEFs , as represented by the proportion of annexin V - positive cells , was significantly increased compared with p53 + / + IRTKS + / + MEFs when exposed to ultraviolet ( UV ) irradiation ( see online supplementary figure 9C and D ) , supporting the notion that IRTKS functions as a negative regulator of p53 activity . IRTKS promotes MDM2 - mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation in gastric cancer cells and Mefs To determine the molecular mechanism by which IRTKS regu - lates the p53 level , we first evaluated p53 protein stability in IRTKS − / − MEFs . The data showed that the half - life of p53 in figure 4 IRTKS deficiency promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of heterozygous p53 mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) .

Gut 2018 ; 67 : 1400 – 1409 . doi : 10 . 1136 / gutjnl - 2016 - 313478 Stomach these MEFs lacking endogenous IRTKS ( more than 60 min ) was significantly longer than in cells expressing wild - type IRTKS ( ~ 15 min ) ( figure 5A and B ) , whereas the half - life of Mdm2 in these MEF cells without IRTKS was not obviously changed ( figure 5A and B ) . We also found that binding of MDM2 to p53 was attenuated in IRTKS − / − MEFs , as shown by a reciprocal co - IP assay with anti - p53 and MDM2 antibodies ( figure 5C and D ) . As a result , ubiquitination of p53 was decreased in the IRTKS - de - ficient MEFs ( figure 5E ) . In contrast , when ectopic IRTKS was introduced into IRTKS - knockout MEFs , the interaction between MDM2 and p53 was clearly enhanced , and p53 polyubiquiti - nation was increased , although the level of p53 was markedly decreased ( figure 5F and G ) . In addition , we also examined the molecular interaction of IRTKS on Mdm2 - mediated p53 ubiquitination in human gastric cancer cells . Expectedly , as with IRTKS knockdown in AGS cells , the association of MDM2 with p53 and p53 polyubiquitination , as shown by co - IP with anti - p53 anti - body , was markedly decreased , although the p53 level was increased ( figure 5H and I ) . By contrast , when IRTKS was forcibly overexpressed in MKN45 cells , the binding of MDM2 to p53 was significantly promoted and accompa - nied by increased polyubiquitination and degradation of p53 ( figure 5J and K ) . Meanwhile , we also examined the expression level of IRTKS in AGS and MKN45 cells after Mdm2 depletion , and we observed no significant change in both cell lines ( see online supplemen - tary figure 10A and B ) , which indicated that IRTKS stability might not be controlled by Mdm2 . These collective data revealed that IRTKS may form a tertiary complex with both Mdm2 and p53 , and IRTKS overexpression promotes MDM2 - mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation in gastric cancer cells and MEFs , suggesting a new cancer - pro - moting mechanism role of IRTKS in tumorigenesis . figure 5 IRTKS promotes p53 ubiquitination and degradation in mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) cells and gastric cancer cells .

Gut 2018 ; 67 : 1400 – 1409 . doi : 10 . 1136 / gutjnl - 2016 - 313478 Stomach Ser331 phosphorylation of IRTKS is required for dissociation of p53 from the IRTKS / MDM2 complex on DnA damage IRTKS is a member of the IRSp53 / MIM ( missing - in - metastasis ) homology domain family and known to be tyrosine phosphory - lated in response to insulin and EGF stimulation . 6 7 17 However , when DNA is damaged , multiple proteins , including p53 , undergo serine / threonine ( Ser / Thr ) phosphorylation by Ser / Thr protein kinase Chk1 or Chk2 . 18 Therefore , we first wanted to define whether the Ser / Thr phosphorylation status of IRTKS is involved in the MDM2 - mediated p53 regulation under DNA damage conditions . Interestingly , we found that IRTKS was clearly Ser / Thr phosphorylated in MEFs after treatment with the genotoxic agent doxorubicin ( DOX ) or UV exposure ( figure 6A and online supplementary figure 11A ) , along with an increased p53 level and phosphorylation of Chk2 . Furthermore , an IP assay with anti - IRTKS antibody showed that Chk2 can be immu - noprecipitated by endogenous IRTKS in MEFs , regardless of whether DNA damage is present ( figure 6A and online supple - mentary figure 11A ) , suggesting that IRTKS could be a substrate of Chk2 kinase via Ser / Thr phosphorylation . To confirm this hypothesis , we knocked down Chk2 with RNAi and then examined the Ser / Thr phosphorylation status of IRTKS following DOX addition . Interestingly , with Chk2 knockdown , the Ser / Thr phosphorylation of IRTKS was significantly decreased in MEFs triggered by DOX ( figure 6B ) , which indicated that Chk2 was an upstream Ser / Thr kinase of IRTKS . Notably , we also found that the interaction between p53 and IRTKS was markedly diminished in MEFs after UV or DOX exposure , although the p53 level was significantly upregu - lated , whereas the interaction of MDM2 with IRTKS remained ( figure 6A and online supplementary figure 11A ) . Therefore , we subsequently need to answer whether the Ser / Thr phosphory - lation of IRTKS is responsible for dissociation of p53 from the IRTKS / MDM2 complex , which leads to upregulation of p53 due to the absence of MDM2 - mediated ubiquitination . To define the Ser / Thr phosphorylation sites required for dissociation of p53 from the IRTKS / MDM2 complex , we analysed the consensus motif of the Chk1 / 2 substrate in IRTKS protein sequences from human , mouse and rat . Interestingly , we found that Ser331 of IRTKS is only one candidate site for Chk1 / 2 activity 19 – 21 ( figure 6C ) . Consistently , the MS analysis confirmed the exis - tence of in vivo phosphorylation of Ser331 site within IRTKS ( see online supplementary figure 11B ) . We then constructed figure 6 Ser331 is a key point for phosphorylation of IRTKS and dissociation from p53 on stress . ( A ) Co - immunoprecipitation ( IP ) experiments in IRTKS + / + and IRTKS − / − mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) either left untreated or treated with 1 . 0 mM doxorubicin ( DOX ) for 4 hours were conducted with anti - IRTKS antibody . ( B ) Co - IP experiments in MEFs with wild - type IRTKS after Chk2 knockdown . ( C ) Chk1 / 2 substrate consensus analysis in IRTKS protein sequences across different species . ( D ) In the in vitro kinase assay , the indicated GST – IRTKS fusion proteins ( 1 µg each ) were incubated with commercially obtained recombinant active Chk2 kinase ( 50 ng ) at 30°C for 30 min . The phosphorylation of GST – IRTKS was detected by anti - phosphorylated Ser / Thr antibody . ( E ) Co - IP experiments in IRTKS − / − MEFs transfected with the indicated IRTKS constructs and left either treated or untreated with 1 . 0 mM DOX for 4 hours . ( F ) Ubiquitination analysis of p53 in IRTKS − / − MEFs transfected with the indicated IRTKS constructs . These cells were incubated with MG132 ( 10 µM ) for 9 hours after 24 hours of transfection and then either treated or untreated with 1 . 0 mM DOX for 4 hours before harvesting . ( G ) The schematic model depicts IRTKS serine phosphorylation at the Ser331 site for p53 dissociation from the IRTKS / MDM2 complex in DNA damage conditions and the role of IRTKS overexpression in tumorigenesis . 1408 Huang l - Y , et al . Gut 2018 ; 67 : 1400 – 1409 . doi : 10 . 1136 / gutjnl - 2016 - 313478 Stomach IRTKS mutant that displaced Ser331 with alanine for in vitro kinase assay , and we found that the IRTKS phosphorylation triggered by active Chk2 kinase was significantly decreased on the IRTKS S331A mutant , as compared with that on wild - type IRTKS ( figure 6D ) . Moreover , when wild - type IRTKS or the mutants were transfected into IRTKS − / − MEFs , the interaction between p53 and IRTKS was significantly attenuated in MEFs with ectopic IRTKS WT , but not IRTKS S331A , after DOX addition ( figure 6E ) ; by contrast , the p53 level was significantly reduced along with the markedly enhanced ubiquitination of p53 in MEFs expressing IRTKS S331A under DOX treatment ( figure 6E and F ) . We further examined the interaction of IRTKS and p53 in gastric cancer MKN45 cells via a co - IP assay after transfecting the cells with these IRTKS vectors . The data showed that disrup - tion of Ser331 phosphorylation of IRTKS facilitated the binding of IRTKS to p53 ( see online supplementary figure 11C ) , whereas ubiquitination of p53 was obviously enhanced by IRTKS S331A ( see online supplementary figure 11D ) . To strengthen the hypothesis , we further constructed an IRTKS S331D mutant that displaced Ser331 with aspartic acid , which may function as a phosphorylation mimic . The result revealed that IRTKS S331D exhibited a somewhat weaker inter - action with p53 than wild - type IRTKS ( see online supplemen - tary figure 11C ) , along with attenuated ubiquitination of p53 in MEFs expressing IRTKS S331D ( see online supplementary figure 11D ) . The collective data suggested that Ser331 phosphorylation of IRTKS is required for dissociation of p53 from the IRTKS / MDM2 complex on DNA damage . DISCuSSIon In this work , we uncovered that , when DNA damage is triggered by UV radiation or DOX treatment , IRTKS is phosphorylated at its Ser / Thr residues , among which Ser331 phosphorylation of IRTKS is required for p53 dissociation from the IRTKS / MDM2 complex ( figure 6 ) . Moreover , we confirmed that Chk2 acts as an upstream kinase required for IRTKS serine phosphoryla - tion in response to DNA damage . In normal conditions , IRTKS may bind to p53 and MDM2 to balance MDM2 - mediated p53 polyubiquitination and proteasome - dependent degradation , maintaining the stability of the p53 level for cell homoeostasis and genomic integrity . However , DNA damage induced Chk2 kinase - mediated IRTKS serine phosphorylation that prevents binding of IRTKS to p53 and simultaneously promotes p53 phosphorylation that blocks binding of p53 to MDM2 , which , finally , attenuates p53 polyubiquitination and proteasome - de - pendent degradation , leading to p53 upregulation to initiate DNA repair or apoptosis ( figure 6G ) . These suggest another new regulatory mechanism for Chk2 - dependent p53 stabilisa - tion by IRTKS phosphorylation . 18 Also , it has been known that 14 - 3 - 3 can typically bind to the serine / threonine - phosphory - lated residues at an RSxpSxP mode 22 ; therefore , we speculate that the Chk2 - mediated phosphorylation of IRTKS at Ser331 site ( RSVpSVA ) might be recognised by 14 - 3 - 3 molecule , which then blocks the interaction of p53 with IRTKS . The speculation is worthy of being further investigated . In tumorigenesis , IRTKS overexpression due to DNA copy amplification or an epigenetic event may enhance the IRTKS / MDM2 / p53 axis , resulting in p53 degradation , which could promote progression of gastric cancer . In this study , the survival data revealed that patients with higher IRTKS expres - sion , together with wild - type p53 , showed very poor clinical outcomes ( figure 1C ) . In contrast , IRTKS deficiency reduced tumorigenesis and prolonged the survival time of p53 hetero - zygous mice ( figure 3A ) . These data suggested that disruption of the IRTKS / MDM2 / p53 axis due to genetic and epigenetic events may contribute to the pathogenesis of tumours by enhancing p53 degradation . Our findings provide new insight for understanding the molecular mechanism by which IRTKS overexpression plays an important role in pathogenesis of human gastric tumours .
