Integrin activation encompasses both increased integrin monomer afﬁnity and increased receptor clustering [ 6 ] and depends on integrin - talin interactions [ 5 ] . Loss of kindlins results in reduced activation of integrins [ 7 – 13 ] . Kindlins might pro - mote talin binding to integrins through a cooperative mech - anism [ 5 , 14 – 16 ] ; however , kindlins do not increase talin association with integrins [ 17 ] . Here , we report that , unlike talin head domain ( THD ) , kindlin - 3 has little effect on the afﬁnity of puriﬁed monomeric a IIb b 3 , and it does not enhance activation by THD . Furthermore , studies with li - gands of varying valency show that kindlins primarily increase cellular a IIb b 3 avidity rather than monomer afﬁnity . In platelets or nucleated cells , loss of kindlins markedly reduces a IIb b 3 binding to multivalent but not monovalent ligands . Finally , silencing of kindlins reduces the clustering of ligand - occupied a IIb b 3 as revealed by total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence and electron microscopy . Thus , in contrast to talins , kindlins have little primary effect on in - tegrin a IIb b 3 afﬁnity for monovalent ligands and increase multivalent ligand binding by promoting the clustering of talin - activated integrins . Results Kindlin - 3 Has a Minimal Effect on the Afﬁnity of Monomeric a IIb b 3 To assess the effect of kindlins on individual integrins , we added puriﬁed kindlin - 3 , the isoform in platelets , to mono - meric platelet integrin a IIb b 3 inserted in 10 – 12 nm diameter phospholipid bilayers ( nanodiscs ) [ 18 ] . Since a IIb b 3 clustering cannot occur under these conditions , ligand binding measures the afﬁnity of integrin monomers [ 18 ] . Recombinant puriﬁed kindlin - 3 was monomeric ( see Figure S1A available online ) and was well folded as judged by a sharp melting point ( 48 (cid:1) C ) in differential scanning calorimetry ( data not shown ) . Kindlin - 3 , at a concentration that saturated b 3 integrin binding [ 14 , 17 ] , was > 25 - fold less active than talin head domain ( THD ) in increasing binding of PAC1 , an activation - speciﬁc antibody , to a IIb b 3 nanodiscs , and it failed to enhance PAC1 binding induced by THD ( Figures 1A and S1B ) . Indeed , kindlin - 3 reduced THD - induced PAC1 binding , possibly due to compe - tition between THD and kindlin - 3 for binding to the limited lipid surface present in the nanodiscs , rather than to the b 3 integrin [ 14 , 17 ] . Recombinant kindlin - 3 bound to the b 3 cytoplasmic domain ( K d = 67 6 9 nM ) , but not to a kindlin binding - defective b 3 mutant [ b 3 ( Y759A ) ; Figure S1C ] . Kindlin - 3 also bound a IIb b 3 nanodiscs ( Figure S1D ) . Thus , in contrast to THD , recombinant kindlin - 3 did not increase the ligand - binding afﬁnity of mono - meric a IIb b 3 in nanodiscs . Kindlins Selectively Increase the Binding of Multivalent Ligands to Recombinant Integrin a IIb b 3 Theforegoingresultssuggestthatkindlin - 3mayregulateligand binding to integrins by a mechanism other than modulation of monomer afﬁnity . Platelet activation clusters integrin a IIb b 3 , and a IIb b 3 dimerization can cooperate with increased mono - merafﬁnityto increasethebindingof multivalent butnotmono - valentligands [ 6 , 20 , 21 ] . These observations ledus to compare the effects of kindlins on the binding of multivalent versus monovalent ligands . Kindlin - 1 and kindlin - 2 are thought to pro - mote a IIb b 3 activation in nonhematopoietic cells via a mecha - nism similar to that of kindlin - 3 in platelets and are thus used to study a IIb b 3 regulation in such cells [ 11 – 13 , 22 ] . Kindlin - 1 did not synergize with THD to increase monovalent PAC1 Fab binding to integrin a IIb b 3 in HEK293 cells but dramatically increasedTHD - inducedbindingofdecavalentPAC1 ( Figure1B ) . To extend this ﬁnding , we used the monovalent ﬁbronectin tenth type III repeat ( 3FN10 ) , an activation - dependent ligand for integrin a IIb b 3 [ 23 ] , because it can be expressed in prokary - otic systems at the high concentrations required for this exper - iment , can be directly labeled ( e . g . , with biotin ) , and binds to murine a IIb b 3 . Again , kindlin - 1 didnotsynergizewith THDtoin - crease the speciﬁc binding of 3FN10 to integrin a IIb b 3 , measured as binding inhibitable by an a IIb b 3 - speciﬁc antago - nist , eptiﬁbatide ( Figures 1C and S1E ) . 3FN10 binding was not maximal in the THD - transfected cells , because addition of Mn 2 + markedly increased binding ( Figure 1C ) . Mn 2 + enhanced THD - induced 3FN10 binding , indicating that Mn 2 + binding to the extracellular domain can synergize with talin to increase in - tegrinmonomerafﬁnity . Insharpcontrasttoresultswith3FN10 , kindlin - 1markedlysynergized [ 13 , 22 ] withTHDinthebindingof decavalent PAC1 immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) ( Figures 1C and S1E ) . The increase of PAC1 binding upon THD expression was greater than that observed with monomeric 3FN10 , prob - ably reﬂecting both the clustering [ 24 ] and conformational changes [ 18 ] of a IIb b 3 induced by THD . To directly test the role of ligand valency in 3FN10 binding , we chemically crosslinked 3FN10 and isolated a mixed population of oligomers . In contrast to monovalent 3FN10 or GST - 3FN10 , kindlin - 1 and kindlin - 2 markedly increased the capacity of THD to enhance the speciﬁc binding of multivalent GST - 3FN10 to a IIb b 3 ( Figure 1D ) . Mutation of the RGD sequence in 3FN10 to AAA abolished the binding of both monomeric and oligomeric 3FN10 ( Figure S1F ) , conﬁrming its 4 Present address : Division of Surgical Research , Alpert Medical School , Brown University , Providence , RI 02903 , USA * Correspondence : mhginsberg @ ucsd . edu speciﬁcity . The kindlin - induced increase in multivalent ligand binding was independent of an intact actin cytoskeleton or myosin II - mediated contractility , as latrunculin A , an inhibitor of actin polymerization , or blebbistatin , a myosin II ATPase inhibitor , was without effect ( Figure S1G ) . Thus , kindlins syner - gized with THD in stimulating the binding of multivalent but not monovalent ligands to a IIb b 3 , and this effect required neither an intact actin cytoskeleton nor myosin II - driven contractility . Silencing of Kindlin - 2 Selectively Inhibits the Binding of Multivalent Ligands to Recombinant Integrin a IIb b 3 We then asked whether depletion of kindlins selectively impairs binding of multivalent integrin ligands . HEK293 cells express both kindlin - 1 and kindlin - 2 [ 25 ] , making it difﬁcult to perform small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) - mediated silencing . Thus , we turned to Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells , which express only kindlin - 2 [ 13 , 17 ] .

Kindlins Selectively Increase the Binding of Multivalent Ligands to Recombinant Integrin a IIb b 3 Cells , but Not to Monomeric Integrins , in Nanodiscs ( A ) Activation of a IIb b 3 in nanodiscs was assayed by PAC1 binding as described in the Supplemental Information . Increase in integrin activation is calculated as ( L i – L 0 ) , where L i is the eptiﬁbatide - inhibitable PAC1 binding ( luminescence ) in the presence of THD ( 2 . 5 m M ) , kindlin - 3 ( 2 . 5 m M ) , or THD + kindlin - 3 and L 0 is PAC1 binding to integrin nanodiscs alone , which was 535 , 000 arbitrary units . Error bars indicate 6 SEM of three independent determinations . ( B ) HEK293 cells stably expressing a IIb b 3 were transfected with cDNA encoding kindlin - 1 , THD , or kindlin - 1 + THD . Twenty - four hours after transfection , cells were harvested , split into three groups , and stained separately with PAC1 , PAC1Fab , or D57 ( anti - a IIb b 3 ) . Cells were then ﬁxed in 3 . 7 % formalde - hyde . The quantity of PAC1 ( decavalent ) , PAC1Fab ( monovalent ) , or D57 bound was assayed by APC - conjugated anti - IgM ( m chain speciﬁc ) and anti - IgG and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry . The a IIb b 3 - speciﬁc ligand binding was calculated as described in the Supplemental Information . The right panel shows the western blots conﬁrming the abundance of expressed proteins in the transfected cells . Error bars indicate 6 SEM of three independent experiments . PAC1 Fab was puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration to remove protein aggregates and used at a concentration at least 25 - fold higher than that used by Bunch [ 19 ] .

Thecellswereprocessed asdescribedin ( B ) , and the binding of PAC1 ( decavalent ) , D57 , or 3FN10 ( GST removed , monovalent ) was assayed .

Depicted is the a IIb b 3 - speciﬁc ligand binding as described in the Supplemental Information . Error bars indicate 6 SEM of four independent experiments . Kindlin - Mediated Integrin Activation 2289 active a IIb b 3 ( D723R ) mutant [ 26 ] , silencing kindlin - 2 inhibited the binding of oligomeric 3FN10 , but it had no effect on the binding of monovalent 3FN10 . This was a speciﬁc effect , as reintroducing small hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) - resistant kindlin - 2 restored the binding of oligomeric 3FN10 ( Fig - ure 2A ) . Moreover , kindlin - 2 depletion resulted in similar selective inhibition of oligomeric but not monomeric 3FN10 binding to an active integrin chimera expressed in CHO cells [ 27 , 28 ] ( Figure S2A ) . Furthermore , adhesion of a IIb b 3 - expressing CHO cells to surface - bound 3FN10 , which is functionally multivalent , was reduced in kindlin - 2 - silenced cells ( Figure S2B ) . Thus , kindlin - 2 silencing inhibits binding of multivalent but not monovalent ligands to a IIb b 3 ex - pressed in nucleated cells . Kindlin - 3 - Deﬁcient Platelets Are Primarily Defective in Binding to Multivalent but Not Monovalent a IIb b 3 Ligands Next , we sought to determine how kindlins function in regulation of a IIb b 3 in platelets .

Depletion of Kindlins Primarily Inhibits the Binding of Multivalent Ligands to Integrin a IIb b 3 in Nucleated Cells and in Mouse Platelets ( A ) Cells expressing an active a IIb b 3 ( D723R ) mutant were transduced with lentivirus expressing a GFP marker and either a scrambled shRNA ( control ) or kindlin - 2 shRNA1 . To conﬁrm the speciﬁcity of previously characterized kindlin - 2 knockdown constructs [ 17 ] , we transiently cotransfected shRNA1 - transduced cells with a shRNA - resistant human kindlin - 2 and tdTomato as a transfection marker ( at a 50 : 1 ratio of kindlin - 2 : tomato ) . The cells were then harvested , and binding of anti - a IIb b 3 ( D57 ) , monomeric 3FN10 ( with GST removed ) , or GST - 3FN10 oligomers was used to measure the a IIb b 3 - speciﬁc ligand binding as described in the Supplemental Information . Error bars indicate 6 SEM of three independent experiments . Kindlin - 2 expression level was assessed by immunoblotting as shown in the right panel . The western blot was performed with total cells , whereas the only transduced ( GFP - positive ) and transfected ( tomato - positive ) cells were analyzed for ligand binding by ﬂow cytometry . ( B ) Generation of chimeric mice as described in the Supplemental Information . For intracellular ﬂow cytometry , platelets were ﬁxed with 2 % formaldehyde , permeabilized , and stained with rabbit anti - kindlin - 3 polyclonal antibody or biotinylated anti - talin monoclonal antibody ( clone 8d4 ) . After washing , bound antibodies were detected with either FITC - anti - rabbit secondary antibody or APC - strepavidin , respectively . The dot plots show the reduced expression of kindlin - 3 and talin1 in DsRed - negative Fermt3 2 / 2 and Tln1 2 / 2 platelets , respectively . ( C ) PAR4 - stimulatedbindingof3FN10toplatelets . PlateletsfromirradiatedmicereconstitutedwithmixturesofDsRed - expressingwild - type ( WT ) andeither Fermt3 2 / 2 or Tln1 2 / 2 hematopoietic stem cells were incubated in the presence of the indicated concentration of PAR4 agonist peptide or buffer . Eptiﬁba - tide - inhibitable speciﬁc binding of 3FN10 ( with GST removed ) to a IIb b 3 on DsRed - negative Fermt3 – / – or Tln1 2 / 2 or DsRed - positive wild - type platelets was assessed by ﬂuorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) . Cells were separately stained with anti - CD41 ( a IIb ) to calculate ligand binding as described in the Supplemental Information . 3FN10 at 100 m g / ml ( 9 . 4 m M ) was used . In both ( C ) and ( D ) , error bars indicate SEM ( seven chimeric mice for each genotype ) . ( D ) PAR4 - stimulated binding of ﬁbrinogen to platelets . In an experiment conducted on the same day as that described in ( C ) , 3FN10 was replaced by FITC - conjugated ﬁbrinogen . Current Biology Vol 23 No 22 2290 erythrocyte defects in addition to reduced a IIb b 3 functions [ 8 , 11 , 29 ] . To examine the consequences of loss of kindlin - 3 , encoded by the Fermt3 locus , in healthy adult mice , we reconstituted irradiated mice with kindlin - 3 or talin null hematopoietic cells mixed with wild - type hematopoietic cells expressing DsRed ( Figure 2B ) . Intracellular staining of iso - lated platelets indicated that kindlin - 3 or talin was depleted from the respective ( DsRed negative ) platelet population ( Figure 2B ) . PAR4 thrombin receptor agonist peptide stimulated similar binding of monovalent 3FN10 to a IIb b 3 in both kindlin - 3 null and wild - type platelets , whereas loss of platelet talin - 1 signif - icantly inhibited 3FN10 binding ( Figure 2C ) . In contrast , and as expected [ 11 , 30 , 31 ] , loss of either kindlin - 3 or talin - 1 impaired the binding of multivalent ﬁbrinogen , which has at least four potential a IIb b 3 binding sites ( Figure 2D ) . Further - more , loss of kindlin - 3 had little effect on either ﬁbrinogen or 3FN10 binding when platelets were activated exogenously by Mn 2 + , consistent with previous reports that Mn 2 + can pro - mote both afﬁnity increase [ 32 , 33 ] and integrin clustering [ 24 , 34 ] ( Figure S2C ) . Deletion of talin reduced binding of 3FN10 but not ﬁbrinogen to Mn 2 + - stimulated platelets ( Fig - ure S2C ) , suggesting that talin binding synergizes with Mn 2 + in increasing integrin monomer afﬁnity . At higher agonist concentration ( 1 mM PAR4 peptide ) , the defect in ﬁbrinogen binding to kindlin - 3 null platelets was even less pronounced . To better quantify this result , we examined binding of various concentrations of 3FN10 to wild - type or kindlin - 3 null platelets . The binding isotherms of 3FN10 to wild - type and kindlin - 3 null platelets virtually overlapped ( Figures S2D and S2F ) , indicating that a lack of kindlin - 3 does not change the afﬁnity of 3FN10 for a IIb b 3 on activated platelets or the capacity of a thrombin receptor agonist peptide to stimulate increased binding of a monovalent ligand to a IIb b 3 ( Figures S2E and S2F ) . Therefore , in agonist - stimulated platelets , as in nucleated cells , lack of kindlin - 3 has a major effect on the binding of multivalent but not monovalent a IIb b 3 ligands , whereas lack of talin has major effects on both ligand types . Kindlins Promote Clustering of Occupied Integrins Integrin clustering increases binding of multivalent ligands without affecting the afﬁnity of integrin a IIb b 3 monomers [ 6 ] , suggesting that integrin clustering might account for most of kindlins’ effects . We used total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy , an established method for studying clustering [ 24 , 35 ] , to measure a IIb b 3 clustering at the submicron scale . Initial cell adhesion to immobilized ﬁbrinogen is a IIb b 3 activation independent [ 36 , 37 ] , possibly due to increased ligand density and altered ﬁbrinogen con - formation [ 38 ] , enabling us to examine effects of kindlins independent of their effects on integrin activation per se . Silencing of kindlin - 2 with two different shRNAs signiﬁcantly reduced both the brightness and size of integrin puncta ( Fig - ures 3A , 3B , and 3D ) , even though it had little or no effect on integrin expression ( Figures 3A and 3C ) . Furthermore , silencing of kindlin - 2 by these shRNAs did not affect the dis - tance of the plasma membrane from the substrate , since ﬂuorescence intensity of a membrane - intercalated dye was equal in control and kindlin - 2 - silenced cells ( Figures S3A and S3B ) in TIRF images . To assess integrin clustering at the nanoscale , we used electron microscopy to examine ventral membranes of ﬁbrinogen - adherent a IIb b 3 - expressing CHO cells [ 39 ] . In control shRNA - transduced cells , we observed numerous clus - ters , each containing more than ﬁve gold particles and usually less than 200 nm in size , i . e . , they account for the point sources seen in the TIRF images ( Figure 4A , left panel ) . In sharp contrast , in kindlin - 2 - silenced cells , gold particles were pre - sent ; however , there were many fewer clusters ( Figures 4A , middle panel , and 4B ) . The total number of gold particles was also reduced , likely reﬂecting an overall decreased abun - dance of integrins in the ventral membrane . Only occasional random gold particles were seen in irrelevant IgG - stained membranes ( Figure 4A , right panel ) . Thus , kindlin - 2 promotes the clustering of ligand - occupied a IIb b 3 at the nanoscale . Kindlins could increase a IIb b 3 clustering either before or after ligand binding . We reasoned that in the latter case , kindlin - dependent increases in ligand binding would be pre - vented by ﬁxing the cells before addition of ligand . When cells were ﬁxed before adding ligands to a IIb b 3 - expressing HEK293 cells , THD induced a near 3 - fold increase in PAC1 binding , but kindlin - 1 failed to synergize with THD in inducing PAC1 binding ( Figure S4A ) . In contrast , kindlin - 1 dramatically increased THD - induced PAC1 binding in cells ﬁxed after ligand addition ( Figure S4A ) . Furthermore , consistent with earlier reports that clustering requires occupancy of the integrin [ 40 ] , when the ability of a IIb b 3 to bind ligand was blocked by a b 3 Asp 119 mutation , the integrin remained diffusely distributed as judged by TIRF microscopy ( Figure S4B ) . Thus , the effect of kindlins on multivalent ligand binding to integrin a IIb b 3 is mediated by their capacity to promote the clustering of ligand - occupied a IIb b 3 . Discussion These results pinpoint the locus of kindlin action in mediating integrin a IIb b 3 activation . Earlier studies in invertebrates [ 41 , 42 ] and cultured cells [ 43 , 44 ] showed that kindlins mediate formation of integrin - mediated adhesions and fore - shadowed studies showing that kindlins regulate the capacity of integrins to bind soluble ligands [ 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 , 13 ] and to pro - mote integrin signals that regulate the cytoskeleton [ 12 ] . Here , we found that the kindlins increase soluble ligand binding to a IIb b 3 primarily by increasing avidity for multivalent ligands due to kindlins’ ability to promote clustering of ligand - occu - pied integrins . Our results now explain why kindlins alone have little apparent effect on soluble ligand binding to cellular integrins in the absence of talin - mediated activation and comport with the ﬁnding that kindlin - 3 does not induce changes in b 3 transmembrane domain topology , which induces integrin a IIb b 3 activation [ 45 ] . We utilized 3FN10 as a monovalent ligand because it binds to both murine and human a IIb b 3 , and for technical ease of crosslinking . Previous studies showed that kindlin - 3 overex - pression increased 3FN ( 7 – 10 ) ( seventh to tenth type III ﬁbro - nectin repeats ) [ 11 ] binding to integrin a 5 b 1 in RAW 264 . 7 cells . In contrast to 3FN10 , 3FN ( 7 – 10 ) contains a free cysteine [ 46 ] and two integrin binding sites , one in 3FN9 and the other in 3FN10 [ 47 ] , and is thus not monovalent . In addition , there may be cell - speciﬁc , kindlin - speciﬁc , and integrin - speciﬁc mechanisms of regulation , as ( 1 ) kindlin - 1 and kindlin - 2 syner - gize with THD to activate a IIb b 3 but inhibit THD - induced a 5 b 1 activation in CHO cells [ 22 ] ; ( 2 ) overexpressed kindlin - 3 is functional in RAW 264 . 7 cells , but not in CHO cells [ 11 ] ; and ( 3 ) kindlin - 3 is required for a L b 2 - but not a 4 b 1 - increased cell adhesiveness under ﬂuid shear stresses [ 9 ] . Secondary antibodies can oligomerize monovalent PAC1 Fab under Kindlin - Mediated Integrin Activation 2291 appropriate conditions , converting it into a multivalent ligand [ 19 ] . We formaldehyde ﬁxed the cells before adding secondary antibody or streptavidin , as recommended by Bunch [ 19 ] , to avoid potential oligomerization of the 3FN10 . Indeed , when highly concentrated PAC1 Fab was used to overcome its low afﬁnity as a monovalent ligand [ 19 ] , we obtained results com - parable to those using 3FN10 ( Figure 1B ) . Thus , when sec - ondary antibody - induced oligomerization is avoided , kindlins have little effect on the binding of an authentic monovalent ligand to integrin a IIb b 3 . Reduced soluble ligand binding alone might not account for the defective platelet aggregation and increased bleeding observed in kindlin - 3 null mice and patients . The combined effects of reduced surface integrin expression [ 11 ] , defective integrin clustering , and impaired integrin outside - in signaling [ 10 – 12 , 43 ] may all make important contributions to the hemo - static defect . Similarly , the effect of kindlin - mediated clus - tering on avidity can be a major contributor to kindlin - 3’s capacity to support the function of b 1 or b 2 integrins that mediate increased resistance of leukocytes to detachment under ﬂow [ 8 , 48 , 49 ] . Kindlin - mediated leukocyte arrest is associated with an additional conformational change in a L b 2 that can be driven by shear stress on the integrin [ 9 , 49 ] . Thus , in addition to effects on soluble ligand binding , it is clear that kindlin - 3 makes multiple contributions to the adhesive functions of blood cells . Integrin - bound kindlins might promote integrin clustering by redistributing integrins between different pools , such as those on the cell surface , in storage pools , and in recycling pathways [ 50 , 51 ] . Indeed , loss of kindlin - 3 is associated with reduced a IIb b 3 surface expression in murine platelets by about 25 % ( [ 11 ] and our unpublished data ) , and overexpression of kind - lins can increase integrin expression in a CHO cell clone [ 22 ] . Alternatively , kindlins can recruit migﬁlin [ 43 ] and integrin - linked kinase ( ILK ) [ 12 ] to occupied integrins , thereby enabling the further recruitment of actin - binding proteins such as ﬁlamins , PINCHs , and parvins [ 52 ] that could promote cooperative integrin clustering . Kindlins can also bind to 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 Control ShRNA Kindlin - 2 ShRNA1 Kindlin - 2 ShRNA2 F l uo r esce n ce I n t e n s i t y o f I n t e g r i n C l u s t e r s ( × 1000 ) Kindlin - 2 GAPDH C on t r o l s h R N A K i nd li n - 2 s h R N A 1 K i nd li n - 2 s h R N A 2 A GFP TIRF DsRed epifluorescence GFP epifluorescence Control shRNA Kindlin - 2 shRNA1 Kindlin - 2 shRNA2 D C B P = 0 . 0001P = 0 . 0001 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 ControlShRNA Kindlin - 2 ShRNA1 Kindlin - 2 ShRNA2 I n t e g r i n E x p r ess i on ( % ) Figure 3 .
