Situated Learning : Legitimate Peripheral Participation , Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger * Does unsituated learning , or so - called general knowledge exist ? * The reading claims " learning is an integral part of generative social practice in the lived - in world . " What does that mean ? * Why do the authors use the phrase " legitimate peripheral participation " if it can neither be illegitimate nor non - peripheral ? * If all education is legitimate peripheral partipation , what does classroom learning accomplish ? * How does school learning differ from learning outside of schools ? * What is the significance of the structure of apprenticeship models of education ? Specifically , that they tend to begin with finishing work , and that they tend not to do any actual teaching . * The reading notes that " engaging in practice , rather than being its object " is important for learning . What does that mean ? * What is the importance of a " culture of practice " for learning ? * What stories do MIT students tell ? * What is the difference between " learning from talk " and " learning to talk " ?
