Our aim was to gain insight into the role of children in the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) and whether aerosol measurements among children can be used to help detect so - called superspreaders — infected individuals with extremely high numbers of exhaled aerosol particles . Methods : In this prospective study , the aerosol concentrations of SARS - CoV - 2 PCR - positive and SARS - CoV - 2 PCR - negative children and adolescents ( 2 – 17 years ) were investigated . All subjects were asked about their current health status and medical history . The exhaled aerosol particle counts of PCR - negative and PCR - positive subjects were measured using the Resp - Aer - Meter ( Palas GmbH , Karlsruhe , Germany ) and compared using linear regression . Results : A total of 250 children and adolescents were included in this study , 105 of whom were SARS - CoV - 2 positive and 145 of whom were SARS - CoV - 2 negative . The median age in both groups was 9 years ( IQR 7 – 11 years ) . A total of 124 ( 49 . 6 % ) participants were female , and 126 ( 50 . 4 % ) participants were male . A total of 81 . 9 % of the SARS - CoV - 2 - positive group had symptoms of viral infection . The median particle count of all individuals was 79 . 55 particles / liter ( IQR 44 . 55 – 141 . 15 ) . There was a tendency for older children to exhale more particles ( 1 – 5 years : 79 . 54 p / L ; 6 – 11 years : 77 . 96 p / L ; 12 – 17 years : 98 . 63 p / L ) . SARS - CoV - 2 PCR status was not a bivariate predictor ( t = 0 . 82 , p = 0 . 415 ) of exhaled aerosol particle count ; however , SARS - CoV - 2 status was shown to be a signi ﬁ cant predictor in a multiple regression model together with age , body mass index ( BMI ) , COVID - 19 vaccination , and past SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( t = 2 . 81 , p = 0 . 005 ) . COVID - 19 vaccination status was a highly signi ﬁ cant predictor of exhaled aerosol particles ( p < . 001 ) . Conclusion : During SARS - CoV - 2 infection , children and adolescents did not have elevated aerosol levels . In addition , no superspreaders were found .

Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) is a novel coronavirus that was ﬁ rst detected in Wuhan , China in December 2019 ( 1 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 is an enveloped RNA virus with a size of 60 – 160 nm , which is similar in size to in ﬂ uenza viruses ( 2 , 3 ) . In March 2020 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) declared the global spread of the pathogen a pandemic ( 4 ) . By December 2022 , over 640 million con ﬁ rmed cases and over 6 . 6 million deaths attributed to the pandemic had been recorded ( 5 ) . Respiratory infections are transmitted through direct contact with an infected person , through indirect contact with a contaminated surface ( fomite ) , or via droplets and aerosols in the surroundings of an infected person ( 6 , 7 ) . Interestingly , the airborne transmission of virus - laden particles ( aerosol transmission ) was not initially considered a relevant route of transmission ( 8 , 9 ) . Accordingly , the WHO declared on March 28 , 2020 , that the virus was transmitted via large droplets that fell to the ground close to infected individuals , as well as by touching contaminated surfaces ( 10 ) . In addition , the WHO recommendation that masks help to control the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 was given rather late ( 11 ) . Currently , it is well established that aerosols play a major role in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission ( 9 , 12 ) . In particular , so - called “ superspreading events ” , in which a high number of SARS - CoV - 2 infections occur , cannot be explained only by droplet transmission or smear infection ( 13 , 14 ) . The same holds true for the observed differences between indoor and outdoor transmission ( 15 ) . The physical behavior of exhaled aerosol particles depends on their size , density , and shape , as well as the ambient temperature , humidity , and air circulation , among other factors ( 8 ) . During normal breathing , the human lungs produce aerosol particles . These particles are generated in the peripheral airways during inhalation by the reopening of collapsed airways and are released during exhalation ( 16 – 19 ) . Studies have already shown that there is interindividual variation in aerosol emissions as well as variation between different activities ( 20 – 22 ) . For instance , it has been shown that aerosol production increases during singing or shouting ( 22 – 25 ) . Most respiratory aerosol particles are much smaller than 5 µm and therefore can penetrate deep into the respiratory tract to the bronchioli and alveoli ( 26 – 30 ) . Approximately 85 % of all exhaled SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was found in particles smaller than 5 µm ( 31 ) . Children infected with coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) often present with mild or no symptoms , and life - threatening conditions or death are rare ( 32 ) . This might be explained by the lower prevalence of preexisting conditions such as hypertension , diabetes , and pulmonary disease among children or by higher exposure to other seasonal coronaviruses , leading to higher antibody titers in children , which might give them some protection against SARS - CoV - 2 ( 33 – 35 ) . Moreover , it is known that the binding of the SARS - CoV - 2 spike protein to angiotensin - converting enzyme - 2 ( ACE2 ) allows the virus to enter cells ( 36 ) . It has been hypothesized that the function of ACE2 is not yet mature in children , and therefore , its binding capacity is lower ( 34 , 37 ) . Bunyavanich et al . suggested that lower expression of ACE2 in the nasal epithelium of children results in lower susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( 38 ) . The role of ACE2 is still under debate , however , and more research is needed ( 36 ) . Unlike among adults , there is little knowledge about aerosol emissions among children ( 39 ) . The question of whether children contribute substantially to the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 has not yet been resolved , despite many observational studies being conducted . The aim of this prospective study was to gain insights into aerosol emission among children and adolescents . Speci ﬁ cally , we aimed to gain further insight into the role of children in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission and to examine the differences in aerosol concentrations and particle size between SARS - CoV - 2 PCR - positive and SARS - CoV - 2 PCR - negative children and adolescents . 2 . Methods 2 . 1 . Study design A monocentric prospective study was conducted to investigate the concentrations and size distribution of exhaled aerosols from SARS - CoV - 2 - positive and SARS - CoV - 2 - negative children and adolescents aged 2 – 17 years . PCR analysis for SARS - CoV - 2 was performed in all subjects who did not have a current SARS - CoV - 2 PCR test result ( max . interval 48 h ) at the time of measurement . The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the Ruhr - University Bochum ( number 21 - 7365 ) and registered under DRKS00028539 in the German Register of Clinical Studies ( DRKS ) . Detailed information was provided to the subjects and their guardians , and the aim and procedure of the study , as well as potential risks , were explained . Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants . The study was supported by the Palas Company which provided the measurement equipment and by the “ Ina und Gerhard Scheuch Stiftung für Aerosolforschung ” . 2 . 2 . Subject recruitment and data collection The subjects were recruited between November 2021 and April 2022 . Potential study participants or their guardians were recruited at cooperating pediatricians ’ of ﬁ ces , schools , and sport clubs , either by approaching them directly or by handing them written information . Parents received further written information after expressing interest . Participants in the study were between 2 and 17 years of age and were divided into three age groups ( 2 – 5 , 6 – 11 , 12 – 17 years ) . Aerosol measurements were performed in subjects with and without acute SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Acute respiratory infection was de ﬁ ned by the presence of at least one of the following symptoms : cough , rhinitis , and fever , with symptom onset in the previous 72 h . Healthy subjects were SARS - CoV - 2 negative as Schuchmann et al . 10 . 3389 / fped . 2023 . 1156366 Frontiers in Pediatrics 02 frontiersin . org well as free of signs of acute upper respiratory tract infection , such as rhinitis , cough , or fever . Subjects who were unable to undergo the aerosol measurement , understand the content of the study , or did not have consent provided by their guardian were excluded from the study . Due to the course of the current SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic , longitudinal measurement of subjects was not feasible . 2 . 3 . Clinical investigations Before aerosol measurement , all subjects or their guardians answered questions regarding their current health status ( weight , height ) , previous diseases ( especially cardiac and pulmonary ) , allergies , medication , coronavirus vaccination status , past SARS - CoV - 2 infection , physical ﬁ tness and tobacco exposure . Subjects with acute upper respiratory tract infection were asked about the time course and symptoms ( cough , rhinitis , fever , etc . ) . All subjects were tested for SARS - CoV - 2 via PCR before aerosol measurement . Variant - speci ﬁ c PCR tests were used to detect virus variants ( e . g . , Delta or Omicron ) in most of the participants . 2 . 4 . Aerosol measurement Measurements of the exhaled particle concentrations and size distribution were performed using the Resp - Aer - Meter ( Palas GmbH , Karlsruhe , Germany ) . For this purpose , the principle of optical light scattering by means of a white light LED sensor of the Fidas ® system was used . With this measuring method , exhaled particles between 145 nm and 10 µm could be detected with high resolution . In the aerosol sensor , a polychromatic light source creates a precisely de ﬁ ned optical measurement volume . Scattered light pulses are generated by the particles when they pass the optical light source . The particle number and size are determined by the number and intensity of the scattered light pulses . The temperature and relative humidity in the exhaled air were also measured and considered . An integrated heating element prevented condensation and allowed larger droplets to evaporate before they reached the sensor ( 40 ) . During the measurement , subjects inhaled and exhaled orally through a mouthpiece . The mouthpiece was connected to a HEPA ﬁ lter via a T - piece which was connected to the Resp - Aer - Meter via a tube . Particle - free air was inhaled through the HEPA ﬁ lter . Nasal breathing was prevented during the measurement process by a nose clip so that the measurement would not be in ﬂ uenced by environmental aerosols . Air was continuously drawn in from the Resp - Aer - Meter via a T - piece for sampling and directed to the sensor . A sterile - packed breathing set was used for each measurement . The breathing set consisted of a mouthpiece , T - piece , antistatic connecting tubing , HEPA ﬁ lter , and nose clip ( Figure 1 ) . Prior to each measurement , a leak test was performed to ensure that the breathing set was ﬁ xed to the Resp - Aer - Meter without leakage . During the ﬁ rst minute of breathing , the washout phase took place . During this phase , environmental aerosol particles that were present in the lungs were washed out . This caused a rapid decrease in the particle concentration in the exhaled air . After a few breaths , the concentration did not further decline , and only the particles produced in the lungs were measured . The subsequent measurement phase lasted approximately 60 – 90 s . The results of the measurement were immediately available for FIGURE 1 Measurement of aerosols . Measurement of the exhaled particle concentrations and size distribution was performed using the Resp - Aer - Meter using the principle of optical light scattering .

In addition to the mean value of the exhaled particle count / liter , the direct evaluation included a graphical chart of the measurement course and the aerosol particle size distribution ( Figure 2 ) . 2 . 5 . Endpoints The primary endpoint of this study was the aerosol concentration in exhaled air measured in particles / liter in children and adolescents with and without SARS - CoV - 2 infection . The secondary endpoints of the study were the in ﬂ uence of confounders such as age , sex , height , weight , BMI , symptoms , tobacco exposure , COVID - 19 vaccination status , and SARS - CoV - 2 infection on the exhaled aerosol concentration . In addition , the particle size distribution was analyzed . 2 . 6 . Statistical methods Statistical analysis was performed with R 4 . 1 . The main hypothesis tested was that a current positive SARS - CoV - 2 infection status was predictive of the particle count in the breath aerosol . Several additional demographic and health - related predictors , including age , sex , allergies , previous infections and diseases , and vaccination status , were considered . All statistical testing was carried out using linear regression models , with the log - transformed particle count as the target variable . First , bivariate regression models were ﬁ tted for each predictor separately . Subsequently , all predictors were entered into a common regression model together with the SARS - CoV - 2 infection status to detect potential interaction patterns . Finally , a subset of predictors that applied only to SARS - CoV - 2 - positive patients , such as the time since symptom onset , or that were otherwise correlated with SARS - CoV - 2 infection status , such as respiratory symptoms , were discarded . The remaining predictors were entered into a common multiple linear regression model , which included the main effects and interaction with the SARS - CoV - 2 infection status for each predictor . This model was subjected to an automatized model selection procedure using the MASS : : stepAIC function in R , which identi ﬁ ed the subset of the original parameters that minimized the model ’ s value on the Akaike Information Criterion ( AIC ) . The AIC is a deviation measure for models that is penalized by model complexity ( number of parameters ) . Hereafter , this model is referred to as the optimized model / regression . 3 . Results A total of 250 children and adolescents were included in this study . Of these subjects , 105 subjects tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 by PCR , and 145 subjects tested negative . Interestingly , testing for SARS - CoV - 2 variants was performed in 89 ( 85 % ) subjects , and all tests ( 100 % ) were positive for the omicron variant . The characteristics of the subjects are shown in Table 1 . The mean age of the SARS - CoV - 2 - positive group was slightly higher than that of the SARS - CoV - 2 - negative group ( 11 vs . 8 years ) . The sex distribution was almost balanced in both groups , with a slight predominance of the male sex in the SARS - CoV - 2 - positive group ( 54 . 3 % vs . 47 . 6 % ) . The median BMI was 17 . 96 in the SARS - CoV - 2 - positive group and 16 . 46 in the SARS - CoV - 2 - negative group . 3 . 1 . Medical history Preexisting medical conditions were present in only 4 . 8 % ( 5 / 105 ) of subjects in the SARS - CoV - 2 - positive group and in 2 . 8 % ( 4 / 145 ) of the SARS - CoV - 2 - negative group . Allergies were FIGURE 2 Results of aerosol measurement . The measurement results display the mean value of exhaled particles / liter , including a graphical chart of the measurement course .

A total of 9 . 5 % ( 10 / 105 ) of SARS - CoV - 2 - positive subjects compared to 17 . 3 % ( 25 / 145 ) of SARS - CoV - 2 - negative subjects were previously infected with SARS - CoV - 2 . In the SARS - CoV - 2 - positive group , 37 . 1 % ( 39 / 105 ) compared to 13 . 8 % ( 20 / 145 ) of the SARS - CoV - 2 - negative subjects had been vaccinated for COVID - 19 . In the SARS - CoV - 2 - positive group , 29 . 5 % of subjects lived in a smoking household ; in the SARS - CoV - 2 - negative group , 20 . 87 % of subjects lived in a smoking household . As expected , 81 . 9 % ( 86 / 105 ) of subjects in the SARS - CoV - 2 - positive group had symptoms of viral infection . The following symptoms were reported : cough in 57 . 1 % ( 60 / 105 ) of subjects , rhinitis in 61 . 9 % ( 65 / 105 ) of subjects , sore throat in 46 . 3 % ( 25 / 54 ) of subjects , and fever in 26 . 7 % ( 28 / 105 ) of subjects . In the SARS - CoV - 2 - negative group , 29 % ( 42 / 145 ) of subjects had symptoms of acute infection and cough was reported in 17 . 2 ( 25 / 245 ) of subjects , rhinitis was reported in 26 . 9 % ( 39 / 145 ) of subjects , sore throat was reported in 2 % ( 1 / 50 ) of subjects , and fever was reported in 0 . 7 % ( 1 / 145 ) of subjects . 3 . 2 . Aerosol measurements The median of all subjects ’ ( SARS - CoV - 2 - positive and SARS - CoV - 2 - negative ) mean particle counts was 79 . 55 p / L ( IQR 44 . 55 – 141 . 15 ) . Between SARS - CoV - 2 - positive subjects ( median 82 . 72 p / L , IQR 44 . 55 – 149 . 52 ) and SARS - CoV - 2 - negative subjects ( median 79 . 55 , IQR 44 . 55 – 136 . 78 ) , there was no signi ﬁ cant difference in the number of exhaled particles ( Figure 3 ) . In the bivariate regression model , the aerosol particle count did not differ between the positive and negative groups ( t = 0 . 82 , p = 0 . 415 ) . However , SARS - CoV - 2 status was shown to be a signi ﬁ cant predictor in the optimized model when controlling for the in ﬂ uence of age , BMI , vaccination status and past SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( t = . 2 . 81 p = 0 . 005 ) . Age had no effect on the aerosol particle count ( bivariate model : t = 1 . 18 , p = 0 . 24 , optimized model : t = − 1 . 68 , p = 0 . 094 ) , but there was a tendency for adolescents ( age group 12 – 17 ) to exhale more particles than younger children ( age group 2 – 5 ; 98 vs . 79 p / L ) ( Figure 4 ) . Past SARS - CoV - 2 infection was not a bivariate predictor ( t = 1 . 4 , p = 0 . 163 ) of the number of aerosol particles , but in the common regression model with age , BMI , SARS - CoV - 2 status , and vaccination status , it showed a signi ﬁ cant association with the number of exhaled aerosol particles ( t = 2 . 26 , p = 0 . 025 ) ( Figure 5 ) . The median mean particle count was 133 p / L among subjects with prior COVID - 19 vaccination vs . 74 . 8 p / L among subjects without COVID - 19 vaccination . Therefore , COVID - 19 vaccination status was a highly signi ﬁ cant predictor of exhaled aerosol particle count in the bivariate as well as the optimized model ( p < 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 6 ) . In addition , there were no signi ﬁ cant differences in the number of exhaled aerosol particles due to sex ( p = 0 . 263 ) , cough ( p = 0 . 934 ) , rhinitis ( p = 0 . 472 ) , sore throat ( p = 0 . 423 ) , fever ( p = 0 . 343 ) , allergies ( p = 0 . 31 ) , tobacco exposure ( p = 0 . 332 ) , and preexisting conditions ( p = 0 . 605 ) . There was a signi ﬁ cant difference in the size distribution of exhaled aerosols between SARS - CoV - 2 - positive and SARS - CoV - 2 - negative subjects ( p = 0 . 041 ) . Although the median particle size in both groups was 0 . 21 µm , the distribution was much narrower in the SARS - CoV - 2 - positive group . The particle size was predominantly less than 0 . 5 µm in both groups ( Figure 7 ) . 4 . Discussion The primary route of transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 is via aerosols , as previously demonstrated in several studies ( 12 , 30 , 41 ) . Children and adolescents have been shown to transmit the virus , yet they do not appear to be the drivers of virus spread ( 13 , 41 ) . It has been reported several times that transmission from adults to children is more common than vice versa ( 37 , 42 ) . Overall , children and adolescents appear to be less infectious than adults with SARS - CoV - 2 ( 33 , 43 , 44 ) . Presumably , the lower expression of ACE - 2 receptors in children also results in lower susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 since SARS - CoV - 2 enters the body via human ACE - 2 receptors ( 37 , 38 ) . We found particle concentrations in children to be substantially lower than those in healthy adults , where an average concentration of 252 p / L has been reported previously using the same method ( 39 ) . This might be due to the lower number of alveoli and terminal bronchioli in children ’ s respiratory tracts , as these structures are thought to be the origin of aerosol production ( 41 , 45 , 46 ) . Additionally , differences in respiratory maneuvers as well as surfactant production may in ﬂ uence aerosol production . Children also have a lower respiratory minute TABLE 1 Characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) - positive and PCR - negative children and adolescents .

Edwards et al . described a correlation between the number of aerosol particles exhaled and age ( 47 ) . However , a direct relationship between aerosol particle exhalation and age group was not observed in this study , but there was a tendency for older children to exhale more particles than younger children ( 98 vs . 79 p / L ) . Contrary to previous ﬁ ndings of Edwards et al . and Gutmann et al . in adults , children suffering from SARS - CoV - 2 infection were not found to exhale signi ﬁ cantly more aerosol particles than uninfected children in this study ( 82 . 72 vs . 79 . 55 p / L ) . Additionally , no infected children were found to breathe more than 595 p / L , whereas so - called superspreaders in studies among adults exhaled > 5 , 000 particles / liter and accounted for 15 . 6 % of infected adults ( 39 ) . At ﬁ rst glance , our aerosol measurements do not match the data from Gutmann et al . ( 48 ) . This study reported signi ﬁ cantly increased exhaled aerosol levels in SARS - CoV - 2 PCR - positive children and adolescents ( median 355 . 0 p / L ) compared to SARS - CoV - 2 PCR - negative participants ( median 195 . 0 p / L ; p < 0 . 001 ) . One possible explanation is that Gutmann et al . measured aerosols when the delta variant was most prevalent from February – December 2021 , whereas most of our measurements were performed when the omicron variant was the predominant variant . Indeed , 85 % of our SARS - CoV - 2 - PCR - positive subjects were tested for virus variants , and in all cases , the omicron variant was detected , which is the predominant virus currently in Germany . Although the symptoms , such as runny nose , fever , and cough , of the delta and omicron COVID - 19 variants are similar , several studies have shown that omicron causes milder disease . Apparently , patients infected with the omicron variant had less involvement of the lower respiratory tract and a reduced likelihood of hospital admission ( 49 – 52 ) . There is increasing evidence that the SARS - CoV - 2 omicron variant exhibits altered cell tropism to escape the immune pressure against ACE2 - dependent viral entry provided by vaccination ( 53 ) . Interestingly , it was demonstrated that the omicron variant replicates faster than other SARS - CoV - 2 variants studied in the bronchi but less ef ﬁ ciently in the lung parenchyma ( 54 ) . Thus , it is tempting to speculate that the delta variant may induce higher levels of aerosols due to higher parenchyma involvement than the omicron variant ( 55 ) . In addition , Gutman et al . showed that patients with respiratory failure and pneumonia had signi ﬁ cantly higher aerosol levels than patients with mild COVID - 19 infection in ambulatory care ( 39 ) . Interestingly , in this study , the number of particles increased signi ﬁ cantly after COVID - 19 vaccination . The underlying mechanism of this ﬁ nding is unclear . There are some reports that surfactant production is altered during COVID - 19 infection ( 56 , 57 ) . Sinnberg et al . demonstrated that IgA autoantibodies to pulmonary surfactant proteins B and C are detectable in patients with COVID - 19 and that these autoantibodies impair the ability of pulmonary surfactant to decrease surface tension ( 56 ) . However , we do not know if such a phenomenon is present after COVID - 19 vaccination . This study had some limitations . For example , only mildly ill , nonhospitalized participants were included . It seems reasonable to assume that the number of exhaled aerosol particles is higher , especially in severely ill SARS - CoV - 2 - positive individuals , for whom respiratory tract damage can be assumed . Additionally , the measurement could not always be performed at the same time as the PCR test , but there was a maximum of 48 h between the measurement of the number of aerosol particles and the PCR test . The participants were not tested for any other respiratory pathogens besides SARS - CoV - 2 . Measurements of SARS - CoV - 2 - positive subjects were performed at different time points during the infection . Longitudinal measurements would be needed to assess the dynamics of aerosol production during the course of infection . Different environmental factors could also have in ﬂ uenced the results . Ambient conditions such as the humidity , season ( weather , pollen count , etc . ) , environmental aerosols ( urban area vs . rural area ) , were not held constant , even though they may play a role in the formation as well as in the measurement of aerosol particles . In addition to the interindividual variation in the measurement of exhaled aerosol particles , the measurements were also in ﬂ uenced by the participant ’ s compliance and breathing technique . In particular , it was dif ﬁ cult for some young children of preschool and primary school age to keep the mouthpiece completely tight during the measurement and carry out the study procedures until completion . In this study , the majority of subjects were infected with the omicron variant of SARS - CoV - 2 . Previous studies that were carried out earlier in the pandemic likely had a very different distribution of SARS - CoV - 2 variants , which might have in ﬂ uenced the number of exhaled aerosol particles . In this study , PCR or viral cultures of virus - containing particles were not analyzed . Furthermore , the participants were not asked to FIGURE 7 Aerosol particle size distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) - positive and PCR - negative children and adolescents . Maximum size of exhaled aerosol particles ( in µm , displayed on the y - axis ) in SARS - CoV - 2 PCR - positive and PCR - negative children and adolescents ( x - axis ) .

In summary , the values of exhaled aerosol particles in children and adolescents are substantially lower overall than those in the studies conducted thus far in adults . Our results indicate that the measurement of exhaled aerosol particles is not suitable as a testing tool in children and adolescents to interrupt chains of infection . Although this study has shown that aerosol measurements in children and adolescents cannot detect and break chains of infection , it has provided further insight into aerosol production in this age group . Further studies are needed to gain a better understanding of the in ﬂ uencing factors on aerosol production .
