Thirty Fifth International Conference on Information Systems , Auckland 2014 1 Using Distractor Images in Web Design to Increase Content Familiarity : A NeuroIS Perspective Research - in - Progress Rob Gleasure Department of Accounting , Finance , and Information Systems Univesity College Cork , Ireland r . gleasure @ ucc . ie Abstract Among other things , ecommerce websites act as the online equivalent of a shop window , allowing users to browse and become familiar with various offerings . Yet the actual cognitive processes by which users become familiar with the content of websites are poorly understood . This study investigates these processes by adopting a neuroIS perspective , i . e . by theorizing how designers might leverage the biological mechanisms enabling users to recognize web - based content . This is captured in a design hypothesis prescribing that webpages include novel distractor images that are positively valenced ( happy ) but low arousal ( not exciting ) . Evaluation of this design hypothesis is underway across two progressively naturalistic iterations of laboratory experiments . Support for the hypothesis is provided by findings from the first iteration situated within within a specifically - developed fictitious website . These findings are discussed , as well as ongoing developments from the second iteration of testing , which takes place within a live web development project . Keywords : Web design , familiarity , neuroIS , familiarity , laboratory experiment Human - Computer Interaction 2 Thirty Fifth International Conference on Information Systems , Auckland 2014 Using Distractor Images in Web Design to Increase Content Familiarity : A NeuroIS Perspective Introduction Good web design requires consideration of the cognitive demands of webpages for users ( e . g . Liang and Lai 2002 , Lindgaard et al . 2006 , van Schaik and Ling 2012 ) . This is because , while users may spend long periods on the Web , individual websites may not receive the same level of intensive and prolonged interaction with users as other applications ( O’Reilly 2007 , Deng and Poole 2010 ) . This characteristic requires that webpages be intuitive to navigate ( Webster and Ahuja 2006 , Balakrishnan and Sundar 2007 ) , avoid excessive complexity , ( Jiang and Benbasat 2007 , Nadkarni and Gupta 2007 ) , appear trustworthy ( Corritore et al . 2003 , Gefen et al . 2003 ) , and present a pleasant aesthetic ( Tractinsky et al . 2006 , Hassenzahl and Monk 2010 ) . It also requires that users can easily recognize and remember the purpose and contents of websites , in order to encourage those users to revisit that website and build a strong ongoing relationship with it ( c . f . Gefen 2000 , McKinney et al . 2002 , Campbell et al . 2013 ) . This final requirement forms the focus of this research , which seeks to develop a means for web designers to better enable content familiarity . Information Systems ( IS ) and organizational science studies have decomposed memory in a variety of ways . Some studies have considered memory at a collective level under the umbrella of organizational knowledge management ( e . g . Stein 1995 , Alavi and Leidner 2001 , Ackerman and Halverson 2004 ) . Other studies have sought to break down the cognitive aspects of memory at an individual level . One approach has been to differentiate between episodic memory , i . e . information about specific individual experiences , and semantic memory , i . e . generalized factual knowledge independent of specific events ( c . f . Stein and Zwass 1995 ) . Another approach has been to build upon a distinction between working / short - term memory and longer term memory ( Nadkarni and Gupta 2007 , Adipat et al . 2011 ) . Yet despite a wealth of IS research surrounding the cognitive aspects of memory , perceptual recognition - based functions have received little attention . These recognition - based memory functions have been the topic of a significant body of research within the field of cognitive neuroscience . That body of research broadly favors a dual - process models of recognition that qualitatively and biologically distinguish between explicit associative memory formation / retrieval and the formation / retrieval of memories that are ( at least initially ) episodically and semantically unbounded ( Yonelina et al . 1998 , Haist et al . 1992 , McLaren et al . 2013 ) . This divides recognition into ‘recollection’ , in which objects are brought to mind in relation to some cue , and ‘familiarity’ , in which objects are perceived as familiar only once they are presented ( Ochsner 2000 , Buckner and Wheeler 2001 , Norman and O’Reilly 2003 ) . An example of this distinction can be considered where an individual is shown a product from a website . On one hand , that individual could be asked whether or not they have seen the product before ( a familiarity - based task ) . On the other hand , the individual could be asked if they know the name , price , or specifications of that product ( a recollection - based task ) . Both of these tasks fall within the broader category of ‘recognition’ . Yet while the second recollection - based task requires the individual retrieve associated memories that were not actually presented , the first familiarity - based task only requires the individual make a judgment as to whether they have encountered the product previously . This ongoing study seeks to synthesize and assimilate the body of research from cognitive neuroscience on familiarity into a web design context . The remainder of the paper is structured as follows . The next section explores existing cognitive neuroscience research relating to recognition ( both familiarity and recollection ) . From this , a biologically grounded model is developed demonstrating how website content becomes familiar . This leads to the development of the central design hypothesis for this study , namely Distractor Images in Web Design : a NeuroIS Perpsective Thirty Fifth International Conference on Information Systems , Auckland 2014 3 that novel , positively valenced , low - arousal distractor images can be used in Web design to facilitate content familiarity . The continuing experimental evaluation of this design hypothesis is then discussed , as are the implications of findings from the completed first build / evaluate iteration . The Biological Foundations of Familiarity A dual - process model of Familiarity and Recollection There is consensus in cognitive neuroscience that the retrieval of perceptual memories involves some reactivation of the neocortical areas that initially perceived the objects being retrieved from memory ( Domasio 1994 , McClelland et al . 1995 , Norman and O’Reilly 2003 ) . This perspective assumes that , for example , remembering seeing a shape will cause neocortical activity in the same parts of the visual cortex that initially became active to perceive that shape . However , there is less consensus in terms of whether recollection and familiarity - based recognition should be viewed as part of a single - process model , in which familiarity can be considered a weaker form of recollection , or a dual - process model , in which the two forms of memory are seen as qualitatively different ( Brown and Aggleton 2001 , Yonelinas 2002 , Wais et al . 2010 , Wixted and Mickes 2010 ) . Some of the strongest sources of evidence that these two forms of memory are qualitatively different arise from findings that different neurophysiological regions are responsible for each ( Allan and Rugg 1997 , Rugg and Yonelinas 2003 , Mayes et al . 2007 ) . These findings suggest that the perirhinal cortex and anterior parahippocampal areas are responsible for familiarity , while the hippocampus and posterior parahippocampal areas are responsible for recollection ( see Yonelinas 2002 for a review of research on how these areas relate to different memory functions ) . Neuroimaging studies have identified neurological responses specific to the perirhinal cortex for familiarity - based tasks and neurological responses specific to the hippocampus for recollection - based tasks ( e . g . Yonelinas et al . 2005 , Diana et al . 2007 , Haskins et al . 2008 ) . Further evidence is also presented by studies of brain lesions , in which behavioral anomalies are studied among individuals who have damage to specific brain regions . These studies have shown instances where subjects with localized hippocampual damage manifest deficiencies in associative recollection - based tasks , but no deficiencies in familiarity - based recognition ( e . g . Mayes et al . 1999 ) . Conversely , impaired performance in familiarity - based tasks with preserved recollection has been observed after anterior temporal - lobe resection that removes the perirhinal cortex but spares the hippocampus ( e . g . Bowles et al . 2007 ) . This implies that familiarity and recollection are complementary but distinct components of the broader network involved in memorization and retrieval . Such a model positions the familiarity - based recognition enabled by the perirhinal cortex and anterior parahippocampal areas as a precursor to associative memory ( c . f . Haist et al . 1992 , Norman and O’Reilly 2003 , Mayes et al . 2007 , Wixted and Mickes 2010 ) . Objects are first identified as being commonly encountered or high - priority items , i . e . familiar , in the perirhinal cortex and anterior parahippocampal areas . These objects , having crosses some threshold for familiarity , are then attributed semantic or spatial associations with other objects in the hippocampus and posterior parahippocampal areas . Each of these two parts of the system responds more strongly to novel stimuli ( Tulving et al . 1996 , Buckner et al . 1998 , Henson et al . 2003 ) , which are automatically allocated greater attentional resources than repetitious stimuli ( Corbetta and Shulman 2002 ) . This is intuitive , as novel stimuli require more initial processing than objects already in memory . Research has suggested that even a single repetition of a stimulus can present a significant decrease in the neural response in both perirhinal and hippocampal areas ( Brown and Aggleton 2001 ) . Yet it is not just the novelty of a stimulus that increases neural responses in these regions , but also the novelty of a particular context ( Ranganath and Rainer 2003 , O’Kane et al . 2005 ) . This means that the neural response is often determined at a scene - level , whereby more obviously new environments incur more active familiarization and recollection processes ( Hayes et al . 2007 ) . Building upon the functions of the regions described , conscious retrieval draw upon prefrontal cortical areas to coordinate different aspects of this system to manage contextual influences and task specifics ( Buckner and Wheeler 2001 , Yonelinas et al . 2005 ) . Nevertheless , the greater the changes in activation in Human - Computer Interaction 4 Thirty Fifth International Conference on Information Systems , Auckland 2014 anterior and posterior parahippocampal areas when objects are encountered , the more effectively these objects can subsequently be retrieved during such conscious tasks ( c . f . Paller and Wagner 2002 ) . The Role of Emotion in Familiarity and Recollection In addition to understanding the biological components involved in recognition and the perception of novelty , a second biological factor must also be considered , namely that of emotion . Studies have shown that individuals perform better on recognition tasks for emotionally arousing tasks ( Bradley et al . 1992 , Dolcos et al . 2004 , Mickley Steinmetz et al . 2012 ) . Such a mediating influence makes sense , as emotional responses are likely to be greater for important events and triggers , which are then more likely to be remembered . The biological mechanism that accounts for this is the ' modulation hypothesis ' , in which areas associated with emotion , notably the amygdala , modulate encoding in medial temporal areas such as the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex ( c . f . McGaugh 2000 ) . Recent research suggests that emotional modulation also incurs greater reactivation in sensory cortices some distance from medial temporal areas , such as the fusiform gyrus and visual word form area involved in visually processing faces and words , respectively ( Hofstetter et al . 2012 ) . Discussions of the emotional modulation of memorization have observed that negatively affective stimuli are memorized more readily than positively affective stimuli ( e . g . Ochsner 2000 , Kensinger 2007 ) . This can be attributed to evolutionary drivers , whereby it is important for survival that negative or threatening stimuli can be recorded in memory and avoided in the future . There has even been the suggestion that a large proportion of the networks involved in the processing of positive and negatively affective stimuli are not shared , with the amygdala ( an area often associated with threat detection ) playing a more central role for negatively affective stimuli ( Kensinger 2004 , Aldhafeeri et al . 2012 ) . This difference in network also manifests an overlapping moderating influence from the arousal levels of stimuli , i . e . how exciting or calming they are . Just as high levels of emotional valence associated with stimuli increase their recognition , high levels of arousal have been shown to enhance some aspects of recognition , particularly recollection . For example one study administered amphetamines and found that stimuli recollection was significantly enhanced ( Soetens et al . 1995 ) . In some circumstances this effect of arousal levels may be stronger than valence for emotional modulation ( Rozenkrantz et al . 2007 ) . Yet this moderating effect significantly decreases when valence is positive , rather than negative ( Mickley Steinmetz and Kensinger 2009 ) . This appears to be because responses in the amygdala are more prominent when processing stimuli of high arousal ( Kensinger 2004 ) . The moderating effect of emotional valence and arousal on different aspects of recognition is also associated with attentional differences . Studies have shown that negatively valenced content encourages attention on specific details of scenes while positively valenced content encourages attention on more holistic aspects ( Gasper and Clore 2002 ) . Similarly , there is also evidence that low arousal content broadens the focus of attentional and high arousal content narrows it ( Gable and Harmon - Jones 2010 ) . Just as differences in recognition , this also appears sensible from an evolutionary perspective . High arousal and negatively valenced stimuli are the most likely to represent immediate threats , therefore attention must be allocated to them directly to avoid danger . This was exemplified by a study in which subjects were presented with both non - threatening images of individuals as well as threatening images in which individuals held weapons ( c . f . Loftus et al . 1991 ) . Threatening details received a greater number and duration of fixations and were subsequently recalled more accurately in cued recall tests . Interestingly , differences in attention did not account for all of the differences however . A comparison of recall results from subjects with similar fixations on details across each image category showed that details from threatening images were still more likely to be recalled . This supported the conclusion that both attention modulation and emotion modulation played distinct but complementary roles in behavioral differences . This narrowing of attentional focus according to negative valence and high arousal appears is once again accredited to dedicated networks for such stimuli in which the amygdala plays a prominent role ( Anderson et al . 2001 , Pessoa 2008 ) . All of these findings taken together suggest that high - arousal negatively valenced content may facilitate high levels of attention on that specific content , whereas low - arousal positively - valenced content may facilitate high levels of attention on content indiscriminately . This is supported by recent observations of faster response times in search tasks with positively valenced distractors and slower response times in tasks with negatively valenced distractors ( Sussman et al . 2013 ) . Furthermore , consistent with previous Distractor Images in Web Design : a NeuroIS Perpsective Thirty Fifth International Conference on Information Systems , Auckland 2014 5 discussions of arousal that study also showed a decreasing impact of arousal levels as valence went from negative to neutral and from neutral to positive . Developing a Design Theory This begs the question as to how such findings can be leveraged in a web design context . Given that much of the research described in the previous section used images as stimuli , the most natural translation is to consider the use of images in the development of websites . Images are often incorporated into web design for aesthetic reasons , to complement the layout of web pages and break up text ( c . f . Michailidou et al . 2008 ) . These images thus act as perceptual distractors to the core textual content of web pages , yet such additions serve to reinforce the usability of the design by improving its overall aesthetic quality ( Lavie and Tractinsky 2004 ) . The previous sections identified three key properties that the distractor images in Web design may possess , as well as three key biological mechanisms responsible for how they are processed , and three key inter - related behavioral outputs . The model in Figure 1 illustrates how these factors may relate to one another . Figure 1 . Design - Relevant Explanatory / Predictive Theory For behavioral outcomes , we have seen that familiarity can be distinguished from recollection as two separate aspects of recognition . According to this view , while familiarity provides a basis for recollection it nonetheless represents a separate behavior in its own right . Further , we know that the extent of attentional focus mediates upon both of the familiarity and recollection . This will means that greater focus on a distractor image may act to increase recollection by creating associations between stimuli , yet it will decrease content familiarity by drawing attention away from such content and onto the images themselves . While many biological mechanisms are responsible for these behaviors to varying degrees , it has also been demonstrated that the perirhinal plays a major role in familiarity , the hippocampus in recollection , and the amygdala in attentional focus . Response in the perirhinal can form a basis for response in the hippocampus as part of the dual - process view of recognition , while response in the amygdala can also provoke response in the hippocampus as part of threat - detection and memorization processes . The properties of a distractor image that may cause response in these areas include the image novelty , the image positivity , and the image arousal . More novel images are likely to provoke responses in both the Human - Computer Interaction 6 Thirty Fifth International Conference on Information Systems , Auckland 2014 perirhinal and hippocampus , meaning greater content familiarity and recollection . More positive images should increase the response in the perirhinal , again resulting in greater levels of content familiarity . This positivity may also decrease response in the hippocampus and amygdala . Such a decrease in activity in the amygdala means an expanding attentional focus from the images themselves onto the content of webpages , due to the decrease in the threat perception reflex . This should further encourage content familiarity , albeit at the expense of some potential for recollection . Lastly , higher levels of image arousal should provoke greater activity in the hippocampus and amygdala . This may potentially benefit recollection however it will also mean a narrowing attentional focus away from the content of a webpage , therefore less familiarity for that content . All of this suggests that the optimal characteristics for a distractor image to increase content familiarity on a webpage are those that maximize response in the perirhinal and minimize response in the amygdala . Thus , the following design hypothesis Webpages should include novel low - arousal images of positive valence to increase users’ familiarity with the core content of that webpage . This design hypothesis is instantiated and evaluated in the following section . Building and Evaluating Artifacts to Test the Design Theory The deductive approach to theory building adopted in this study , combined with the behavioral nature of the utility sought , lends itself to a ' strategy 1 ' approach , i . e . a neuroIS design science study in which existing theory from cognitive neuroscience informs design theorizing , yet behavioral measures are used to determine the utility of the resulting design theory ( vom Brocke et al . 2013 ) . This is in contrast to ' strategy 2 ' studies , that use neuroimaging and psychophysiological tools as part of evaluation , or ' strategy 3 ' studies that incorporate biofeedback from such tools as part of user interaction . The strategy 1 approach used here includes two build / evaluate iterations . The setting for the first iteration is a fictitious specifically - developed website , which allows for some control over domain - related contextual factors , such that causal effects can be readily identified . The second iteration represents a confirmatory ‘naturalistic’ evaluation , performed within a live web development project to ensure the practicability of the design hypothesis in a realistic working environment ( Pries - Heje et al 2008 , Venable et al . 2012 ) . Research for the second , i . e . naturalistic , iteration is ongoing , however the method and findings from the first iteration are presented as follows . Method for Iteration 1 The website developed for the first iteration took the form of a web portal for third party massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) . This web portal contained seven pages in total , including one homepage and six web pages dedicated to six specific categories of MOOCs . Images were placed in the center of the screen , above the main content of webpages , and below a logo for the fictitious website and a simple navigation bar ( see Figure 2 ) . The images used were taken from the International Affective Picture System ( IAPS ) , a standardized set of color photographs across a range of semantic categories , which are distributed to researchers upon request , along with quantitative ratings for valence , arousal , and dominance ( Lang et al . 2008 ) . This set of images has been successfully employed in a range of cognitive and affective neuroscience studies ( e . g . Cuthbert et al . 2000 , Müller et al . 2003 , Britton et al . 2006 ) . The images used in this study were taken from the subset that possessed valence scores > 6 . 5 on the negative - positive dimension , as well as scores on the arousal dimension of either < 4 . 5 for low - arousal images or > 6 . 5 for high - arousal images . This resulted in an array of eligible images , from which the most semantically relevant were selected , e . g . the images used for the Engineering and Technology category depicted a train or an aircraft , while the images used Music and Film depicted a violin or a crowd of people dancing . A 2x2x2 between - subjects factorial design was implemented to test the design hypothesis . The first factor represented image novelty , whereby the website either displayed the same image continuously across different webpages , or a novel image for each individual webpage . The second factor represented image arousal , whereby images displayed on the website were either high - arousal or low - arousal . The third factor represented the basic behavioral dynamics of the interaction . The focus of attention differs among search tasks and other visual behavior ( Itti and Koch 2001 ) , hence subjects were either ( 1 ) presented with Distractor Images in Web Design : a NeuroIS Perpsective Thirty Fifth International Conference on Information Systems , Auckland 2014 7 six search tasks to find and select some specific course as quickly as possible , without being told in which category that course was located , or ( 2 ) to browse each category and select the course they found most interesting . Subjects were briefed that the purpose of the experiment was to evaluate some aspects of web design but were not made aware that familiarity or memory was the main focus of this investigation . This approach was taken to avoid giving subjects any knowledge that could compromise their ability to behave in a representative manner . Upon completion of the experiment , each subject was presented with 10 courses , 5 of which they had been exposed to in the original website and 5 of which they had not . They were then asked to select the 5 courses they believed they had most likely encountered . Figure 2 . Screenshots of the Website used for Iteration 1 The experiment was first administered locally in a one - to - one setting to six subjects , as part of an internal pilot to identify procedural ambiguities or opportunities for misinterpretation . No issues were observed , during this pilot study , hence full data gathering commenced with the same protocol . Findings from Iteration 1 131 subjects participated in the experiment as part of coursework for one undergraduate program and one postgraduate program . This included 77 males and 54 females with an average age of 23 . 67 . Of these subjects , 64 were randomly assigned single image conditions and 67 were assigned novel image conditions , 70 were assigned high arousal images and 61 were assigned low arousal conditions , and 69 were assigned timed search tasks and 62 were assigned non - timed browsing tasks . A multivariate analysis of variance ( MANOVA ) test confirmed that the random assignment of subjects among combinations of the design principles was successful , as there were no significant differences among the groups in age ( F = . 903 , p = . 693 ) , nor gender ( F = . 887 , p = . 45 ) . There were also no significant differences between the number of correctly identified items in the recognition task between male subjects ( M = 3 . 17 , SD = . 923 , N = 77 ) and female ( M = 2 . 98 , SD = 1 . 0 , N = 54 ) subjects , t ( 129 ) = 1 . 105 , p = . 271 , nor was there a significant linear relationship between age and the number of correctly identified items ( Beta = . 001 , p = . 993 ) . The scores from the course recognition tests for these subjects were compared with a two - tailed analysis of variance , the results of which are illustrated in Table 1 . These results show two statistically significant relationships . The first of these is the interaction between whether the images used were novel on each page or constant , and whether the images used were low - arousal or high - arousal ( see Figure 3 ) . This interaction shows that subjects performed best on the familiarity test when their web pages contained novel low - arousal images , under which conditions they correctly identified an average of 3 . 406 courses . The absence of any interaction with browsing / searching conditions also suggests that this was unaffected Human - Computer Interaction 8 Thirty Fifth International Conference on Information Systems , Auckland 2014 by behavioral differences in the tasks set for users . Thus the design hypothesis put forward by this study is supported . The second statistically significant relationship was the main effect for the browsing / searching condition . The average subject correctly identified 3 . 09 courses , however this rose to 3 . 523 during browsing tasks and fell to 2 . 712 during search tasks . The existence of this difference is arguably not surprising , however the extent of the difference is interesting , as subjects in search tasks performed subsequent familiarity tests at a level close to that of pure chance . This suggests that individuals searching an ecommerce website for some specific item will gain familiarity with it far slower than those engaging in browsing behavior . Table 1 .

Interaction effect for content recognition between image - novelty and image arousal Discussion of Findings and Ongoing Research Based upon the findings from the first iteration , a second instantiation is taking place within an ecommerce website for a manufacturer of luxury confectionary goods in the South - West of Ireland . The actual instantiation of the design hypothesis has already been carried out , which provides support for the practicability of the design hypothesis . However a second round of laboratory experiments is necessary to confirm the actual utility of that design before any conclusions can be definitively reached . The findings from this study have implications for both neuroIS research and industrial web design . With regard to neuroIS , there are opportunities to expand upon the current research with more strategy 1 studies looking at other features of web design that contribute to users’ emotional response and content familiarity , e . g . colors , sounds , animations , layouts , etc . There are also opportunities for strategy 2 research that seeks to identify biological correlates of the interplay between positively affective web design , arousal , and familiarity . Such research could then lay the foundation for strategy 3 research based on biofeedback mechanisms , e . g . facial recognition could be used to determine whether users are responding positively to images , eye - tracking could be used to determine attention and arousal , etc . The interface could then adapt to optimize interaction for any particular user , replacing ineffective images , adjusting contrast , etc . Lastly , there are opportunities to investigate the separate but related issue of content recollection in web design , which this study has not explored in detail . The interplay between these two facets of memorization , emotional valence , arousal , and different forms of web behavior , remain to be examined more closely at a neurophysiological level . The implications for industrial web design are both direct and indirect . The direct implications concern the use of novel low - arousal imagery as a means of increasing content familiarity . The findings also suggest that websites should encourage browsing behavior in users where possible , rather than encouraging visits where users are looking for some pre - determined items . Indirect implications can be abstracted to a more mindful consideration by designers of the arousal - level of images and the goals of the website . Where the temptation may exist to increase the arousal of images to add excitement and catch users’ attention ( e . g . Lindgard et al . 2006 ) , designers must maintain careful management of emotional valence if they are to effectively cultivate users’ familiarity with content .
