R E V I E W : C E L L B I O L O G Y The Structural Era of Endocytosis M . Marsh 1 and H . T . McMahon 2 Endocytosis is crucial for an array of cellular functions and can occur through several distinct mechanisms with the capacity to internalize anything from small molecules to entire cells . The clathrin - mediated endocytic pathway has recently received consid - erable attention because of ( i ) the identi(cid:222)cation of an array of molecules that orchestrate the assembly of clathrin - coated vesicles and the selection of the vesicle cargo and ( ii ) the resolution of structures for a number of these proteins . Together , these data provide an initial three - dimensional framework for understanding the clathrin endocytic machinery . T he uptake , or endocytosis , of extracel - lular material into cells in membrane - bound vesicles has enthralled cell biol - ogists for most of this century . The many functions in which endocytosis plays a role , including antigen presentation , nutrient ac - quisition , clearance of apoptotic cells , patho - gen entry , receptor regulation , hypertension , and synaptic transmission , has stimulated this interest . But , there has also been a fascination with understanding the basic mechanisms that underlie endocytosis : for example , how plasma membrane is induced to form vesi - cles , how cell surface components are selec - tively included into these vesicles , and how the vesicle membrane and content are deliv - ered to intracellular compartments . Endocy - tosis can occur through several morphologi - cally and biochemically distinct mechanisms . Here , we focus on developments in the clath - rin - mediated endocytic pathway . The Clathrin Coat Morphologically visible coats are seen on many vesicles that mediate transport between membrane - bound compartments in the cell . Coats function to deform the donor mem - brane to produce a vesicle , and they also function in the selection of the vesicle cargo . Three coat complexes have been well char - acterized so far : coat protein – I ( COP - I ) , COP - II , and clathrin ( 1 ) . COP - I coats are associated with vesicles that operate between the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic re - ticulum ( ER ) and at other steps within the Golgi and endosomal systems ; COP - II coats are involved in transport from the ER to the Golgi . Clathrin coats are involved in two crucial transport steps : ( i ) receptor - mediated and fluid - phase endocytosis from the plasma membrane to early endosomes and ( ii ) trans - port from the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) to endosomes . They may also function in trans - port from endosomes , immature secretory granules , and possibly other sites in the cell ( 2 ) . In endocytosis , the clathrin coat is assem - bled on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane , forming pits that invaginate to pinch off ( scission ) and become free clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) ( Fig . 1A ) . In cultured cells , the assembly of a CCV takes ; 1 min , and several hundred to a thousand or more can form every minute ( 3 ) . In other situa - tions , such as the synapse , the clathrin cycle can be much faster and is tightly regulated ( 4 ) . Clathrin - coated pits and CCVs can be identified in thin - section electron microscopy ( EM ) by the characteristic bristle density seen on the cytosolic side of coated membranes ( Fig . 1A ) . EM imaging of deep - etched sur - faces show these coats to be highly ordered polygonal arrays ( Fig . 1B ) ( 5 ) , an organiza - tion also seen for isolated CCVs and clathrin cages ( Fig . 1C ) ( 6 , 7 ) .

( C ) A 21 (cid:129) resolution map of a clathrin hexagonal barrel assembled from puri(cid:222)ed clathrin and AP2 complexes ( 7 ) . In vivo coated vesicles are larger ; the minimum composition suggested to accommodate a vesicle is 60 triskelions assembled into 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons to achieve curvature . Each side of every polygon in the cage contains four segments of leg derived from four different triskelions . The proximal leg domains from adjacent hubs form an antiparallel pair on the top of each edge , and the distal domains make an antiparallel pair beneath . A small clockwise twist of the clathrin triskelion ( as indicated with the yellow triskelion ) would detach it from the cage . The middle and right panels show schematic views of the clathrin cage and the organization of the triskelion , respectively . S C I E N C E (cid:213) S C O M P A S S c R E V I E W www . sciencemag . org SCIENCE VOL 285 9 JULY 1999 215 years ago gave the first indication of the composition of these coats ( 8 ) . The main scaffold component is the 190 - kD protein called clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) , which is associated with an ; 25 - kD protein called the clathrin light chain ( CLC ) . These CHC - CLC complexes form three - legged trimers , called triskelions ( Fig . 1C ) ( 9 ) , that can oligomerize both in vivo and in vitro to give the polygonal arrays seen with EM ( 10 ) . Other proteins found in the clathrin coat include the assembly protein AP180 and the adaptor complexes ( APs ) . AP180 has clathrin assembly activity in vitro and is crucial for synaptic vesicle endocytosis and the mainte - nance of a uniform - sized vesicle population in vivo ( 11 ) . APs can promote clathrin cage assembly , linking clathrin to the membrane and interacting with membrane proteins that contain appropriate signals for sorting into CCVs ( 12 ) . Each AP contains four polypep - tides , called adaptins : two of ; 100 kD , a medium ( m ) chain of ; 50 kD , and a small ( s ) chain of ; 25 kD . These proteins form com - plexes that , by freeze - etch EM , appear as blocks from which the COOH - terminal do - mains of the two 100 - kD adaptins protrude as appendages or ears ( 13 ) . Different APs are associated with specific CCV populations and confer distinct sorting properties onto these vesicles . Thus , AP1 complexes are as - sociated with CCVs derived from the TGN and contain g , b 1 , m 1 , and s 1 chains ; AP2s are associated with endocytic CCVs and con - tain a , b 2 , m 2 , and s 2 chains . Additional adaptor complexes , AP3 and AP4 , have been identified but have not been characterized in detail ( 14 , 15 ) . Another group of proteins that may also function as adaptors to link cell surface pro - teins to the clathrin scaffold are nonvisual arrestins ( b - arrestin and arrestin - 3 ) that me - diate the internalization of activated hetero - trimeric GTP – binding protein ( G protein ) coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) ( 16 – 17 ) . Clathrin Pearse and colleagues used EM to generate the first detailed map of clathrin cages con - taining 8 hexagons and 12 pentagons ( 36 triskelions ) ( 6 ) . Low - temperature EM and developments in image analysis have allowed this structure to be resolved to 21 Å ( Fig . 1C ) ( 7 ) . A triskelion hub domain is centered at each vertex of the cage , and three legs project in different directions from the hub ( Fig . 1C ) . The legs are divided into a proximal and a distal domain by a bend midway along each . Thus , each leg contributes to two sides of a polygonal cell ( Fig . 1C ) . The proximal leg domains form antiparallel pairs located on the outer surface of each edge . The distal leg domains lie along the underside of a second edge and position the NH 2 - terminal domains of clathrin below the next hub , where they are oriented to interact with the APs located in - side the cage . Thus , each edge is made up of four leg domains . The interlocking of the triskelions is such that a clockwise twist on any one could detach it from the cage ( yellow triskelion in Fig . 1C ) . This may be the event catalyzed by heat shock cognate 70 ( Hsc70 ) and auxilin , which disassembles the clathrin cage ( 18 ) . The crystal structure for the NH 2 - terminal domain of the CHC was recently published ( 19 ) . This 330 – amino acid domain is a sev - en - bladed b propeller , similar to that found in , for example , the b subunits of heterotri - meric G proteins ( Fig . 2 ) . Prominent grooves are seen between blades 1 and 2 and blades 4 and 5 of the propeller . Residues Gln 89 , Phe 91 , Lys 96 , and Lys 98 lie on the margins of the groove between blades 1 and 2 and are cru - cial for arrestin binding ( 17 ) . The clathrin - binding motif at the COOH - termini of non - visual arrestins ( 15 , 17 ) likely binds into this groove of the propeller . The clathrin - binding motif on AP2 has sequence similarity to that on the arrestins ( 15 ) and suggests that AP2 will also interact between blades 1 and 2 of this propeller . A section of linker that couples the pro - peller to the distal leg was also seen in the terminal domain structure and is made up of a zigzag of 10 short a helices connected by loops ( Fig . 2 ) ( 19 ) . These helices pack onto each other in successive pairs to form a flex - ible stemlike structure . A similar structure was recently published for a fragment of the proximal leg of CHC that is involved in CHC polymerization and CLC association ( 20 ) . This structure is an elongated right - handed superhelix that is also made up of short a helices linked by loops . However , in contrast to the flexibility in the linker region , the packing of the helices in the proximal leg fragment suggests a rigid structure . Endocytosis Signals and Adaptors Membrane proteins that are internalized in CCVs contain one or more signal sequences in their cytoplasmic domain or domains that direct the protein into clathrin - coated pits . Four types of endocytic sorting signals have Fig . 2 . Crystal and NMR structures of domains of proteins involved in clathrin - dependent endocytosis .

Both YxxØ and LL signals interact with AP2 complexes ( 12 ) . For the YxxØ signals at least , this interaction is mediated by the AP2 m 2 chain . Co - crystallization of the signal - binding portion of m 2 with several YxxØ peptides has provided a structural explanation for this binding specificity ( 24 ) . The m 2 frag - ment is an elongated banana - shaped b - sheet structure ( Fig . 2 ) . The YxxØ signal sequence binds to the surface of two parallel b strands of m 2 such that the side chains of the Y and Ø residues are oriented into two hydrophobic pockets in the surface of the m subunit . The YxxØ peptides are bound in an extended conformation and not in the tight turn pre - dicted by previous nuclear magnetic reso - nance ( NMR ) analyses of internalization sig - nals in solution . The hydroxyl group of the Y contributes to a network of interactions with residues of m 2 that form the hydrophobic pocket , explaining why F does not efficiently substitute for Y in YxxØ signals ( 25 ) . How - ever , the NH 2 - terminus of the glucose trans - porter Glut4 does contain an F that is essen - tial for its endocytosis ( 26 ) . A similar F is also found in the NH 2 - terminus of the water channel , aquaporin - 2 . Both of these proteins are inserted into the plasma membrane tran - siently , following cell stimulation , and are then subjected to endocytosis . Because they need to reside in the plasma membrane for a finite length of time , the presence of F instead of Y in the endocytosis signal may result in weaker interactions with m 2 and slower en - docytosis . The m 2 crystal structure also indi - cates that phospho - tyrosine would not bind into its hydrophobic pocket . Thus , the phos - phorylation , and switching off , of some Y - based signals could provide an endocytic reg - ulatory mechanism ( 27 ) . The binding site on AP2 for LL signals is not yet clearly estab - lished ( 28 ) ; however , the YxxØ binding site on m 2 may only bind LL signals weakly , if at all . It is unclear whether recruitment of AP2 complexes to the plasma membrane requires association with proteins ( 29 , 30 ) . Clathrin and APs alone can form cages on liposomes in vitro , indicating that a protein receptor may not be essential for pit formation and that cage assembly can be sufficient to drive membrane deformation ( 30 ) . The putative membrane - facing surface of m 2 has a posi - tively charged surface potential that could facilitate electrostatic binding of AP2 to the negatively charged membrane surface ( 24 ) . Nevertheless , recruitment of coat compo - nents may be more efficient on cellular mem - brane preparations ( 29 , 30 ) , and membrane - associated proteins may still facilitate coat recruitment . Various important residues used in the com - plex of m 2 with internalization signals are not conserved in other m chains ( for example , Lys 420 3 Pro 420 in m 1 and Lys 203 3 Cys 203 in m 3a ) . These variations likely account for subtle differences in the signal recognition properties of different adaptors , thus allowing selective cargo incorporation into vesicles derived from different membrane systems ( 12 ) . The exis - tence of consensus sequences for internalization allows one to begin to predict candidate pro - teins that could be internalized by endocytic CCVs . For example , many of the integral mem - brane proteins of synaptic vesicles have YxxØ sequences ( for example , Scamp 37 and synap - tophysin ) , although these sequences have not yet been shown to function as endocytosis sig - nals in these proteins . The identification of m - chain residues that are key to signal recogni - tion has enabled the generation of dominant negative m 2 constructs , which will allow the probing of specific functions of AP2 complexes ( 31 ) . In addition to m 2 , the crystal structure of a second element of the AP2 complex , the a - adaptin appendage ( ear ) domain has been solved ( 32 ) . With the structural solution and dominant negative experiments based on the structure , the importance of this domain is beginning to be appreciated . The NH 2 - termi - nal b - sandwich subdomain appears to func - tion as a scaffold and spacer that support a COOH - terminal platform subdomain to which various proteins implicated in endocytosis ( including the amphiphysin , Eps15 , epsin , AP180 , and auxilin ) bind . The binding site is centered around Trp 840 and is surrounded by Table 1 . Structures determined for proteins involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . 2D , two - dimensional .

It was observed that each of the appendage domain ligands have conserved DPF or DPW motifs ( 21 , 33 , 34 ) , and these were shown to be involved in the interaction with the single binding pocket on the COOH - terminal subdomain ( 32 ) . Thus , the ear domain recruits key components of the CCV assembly machinery in a spatially and temporally regulated fashion . The struc - ture of the b 2 ear has yet to be established , as do its binding partners [ other than clathrin , which interacts with the b 2 hinge region ( 15 ) ] . The terminal domains from three separate triskelions sit under each vertex of the cage ( Fig . 1C ) and can be traced onto electron density seen in the 21 Å map ( 35 ) . The terminal domains are positioned to interact with APs and electron density from the NH 2 - terminus appears continuous with the APs in the 21 Å structure ( 8 ) . If three terminal domains are found under each vertex , there could be three APs per vertex ( that is , one adaptor per head domain ) . However , visualization of trans - ferrin receptors located in coated pits suggest just one receptor per vertex and thus possibly only one AP2 complex ( 36 ) . Clathrin - and Adaptor - Associated Proteins In addition to the basic scaffold proteins that form clathrin - coated structures , other proteins can bind to either clathrin or clathrin APs ( Ta - ble 1 and Fig . 3 ) . Most of these proteins do not copurify stoichiometrically with CCVs and are therefore thought to modulate cage assembly , vesicle scission , cage disassembly , or recycling of the structural components of the coat . These proteins interact using a variety of defined structural modules like the protein - lipid recog - nition module [ pleckstrin homology ( PH ) do - main ] or various protein - protein recognition modules [ for example , SRC homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain , coiled - coil domain , proline - rich do - main , and Eps15 homology ( EH ) domain ] and are likely regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions ( 37 ) . Moreover , the functional role of these proteins has , in many cases , been demonstrated through the ability of isolated domains to function as dominant negative inhibitors of receptor - me - diated endocytosis . Dynamin and Amphiphysin The mechanism by which an invaginated coated pit is converted to a vesicle remains unclear . A cytoplasmic guanosine triphos - phatase ( GTPase ) , dynamin , is thought to be a key player in this step . Drosophila carrying the temperature sensitive Shibire mutation in dynamin and cells expressing GTPase - defec - tive forms of dynamin exhibit endocytosis defects that correlate with a lack of vesicle scission ( 38 ) . Moreover , dynamin has been located on the necks of deeply invaginated pits by EM ( 38 ) . The means by which dynamin is recruited to clathrin - coated pits have recently received particular attention . Amphiphysin , a cytosolic protein that can simultaneously bind the AP2 a ear and dynamin through different domains ( 39 ) , has been implicated in dynamin recruit - ment . The SH3 domain of amphiphysin binds to a proline - rich domain in dynamin , and disruption of this interaction by peptides or recombinant amphiphysin SH3 domains blocks recruitment of dynamin to coated pits and clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( 39 , 40 ) . The amphiphysin SH3 domain not only binds dy - namin but also prevents dynamin’s assembly into oligomers . Crystallization shows that the amphiphysin - 2 SH3 domain ( Fig . 2 ) contains an enlarged n - Src loop that is at least partially responsible for the SH3 prevention of dy - namin assembly ( 41 ) . Because dynamin will polymerize at high concentrations , amphiphy - sin may ensure that dynamin is kept in a dissociated form at the sites of endocytosis until it is required for the scission reaction . In the nerve terminal , at least , the amphiphysin - dynamin interaction is also negatively regu - lated by phosphorylation of dynamin on serine residues ( 37 ) . This modification may allow a primed endocytic machinery to be rapidly switched on by regulating the avail - ability of dynamin for binding to the vesicle neck . How does dynamin participate in the endo - cytosis event ? Purified dynamin can constrict lipid vesicles to form long tubelike structures , with diameters similar to those found on the necks of forming endocytic vesicles ( 30 , 42 ) . These structures are seen in the absence of nucleotides and demonstrate that dynamin alone is capable of inducing tubule formation . Other factors may also contribute to vesicle neck formation , such as the closure of the clath - rin cage , which results in a tight confinement of membrane through the lattice , or a specific lipid composition may favor the formation of this structure . Although dynamin may not be essen - tial for the formation of deeply invaginated coated pits , it does seem to limit the neck diameter , as disruption of the dynamin - am - phiphysin interaction in the lamprey synapse results in the accumulation of endocytosis pro - files that are not tightly constricted ( 40 ) . Dy - namin’s GTPase activity is not likely to be required for vesicle neck formation , but it’s GTPase activity is required for endocytosis . The molecular details of the vesicle scission are yet unresolved , but three models have been put forward for dynamin’s function in this step . One model proposes that scission occurs on constriction by dynamin of the vesicle’s neck after GTP hydrolysis , causing the bilayers to fuse and the vesicle to be released ( 42 ) . Another model shows that GTP hydrolysis can cause a concerted elongation of a dynamin spiral , and so vesicle fission would be achieved by stretch - ing of the vesicle neck ( 43 ) . Alternatively , there is evidence that the GTPase activity of dynamin may not itself induce scission ; rather , the dy - namin GTPase may act as a switch to regulate downstream effectors that mediate the scission step ( 44 ) . Further work is required to distin - guish these possibilities . Dynamin’s interaction with acidic phos - pholipids is pivotal to its ability to form Fig . 3 . Protein - protein interactions between clathrin and clathrin - associated proteins . The dashed lines indicate that the interactions between synaptojanin and Eps15 and be - tween AP180 and Eps15 may not occur for neu - ronal forms of synapto - janin and AP180 that lack the NPF motifs . The interactions of multiple proteins with the a - adaptin ear domain are competitive , and thus , in vivo , there must be a se - quential and spatial or - der to these interactions that are not represented in the diagram .

This inter - action is of low affinity , but binding may be enhanced by dimerization of the PH domains ( 46 ) . The structure of the lipid - binding PH domain of dynamin has been solved ( 47 , 48 ) ( Fig . 2 ) , and the selectivity of this domain for membranes containing phosphatidylinositol phosphate has been demonstrated biochemi - cally ( 48 ) . A preference for phosphatidylino - sitol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) may help to specify the region of the membrane in which dynamin oligomerization takes place . The cy - tosolic protein synaptojanin ( which also binds to amphiphysin ) is a phosphatidylinositol phos - phatase ( 49 ) , whose activity may be impor - tant in adjusting the inositol lipid composi - tion of membranes and , thereby , regulating dynamin recruitment . However , this may not be the only function of this phosphatase , as the binding of AP180 and other APs to mem - branes also depends on phosphatidylinositol phosphates . Dynamin’s functions extend beyond CCV formation at the plasma membrane . There are at least three dynamin genes that together can generate 20 or more dynamin isoforms ( 50 ) . Dynamin and dynamin - related proteins have been implicated not only in clathrin - depen - dent endocytosis but also in Golgi function , caveolae formation , and mitochondrial bio - genesis ( 50 ) . However , the observation that fluid - phase endocytosis is up - regulated in cells expressing a GTPase - defective dynamin that suppresses clathrin - mediated endocytosis indicates that cells may also use other endo - cytic pathways that employ distinct dynamin isoforms or alternative fission mechanisms ( 51 ) . Eps15 and EH Domains Eps15 was initially identified as a major cy - tosolic substrate for ligand - activated epider - mal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor tyrosine kinase . Interaction between Eps15 and the EGF receptor has not been detected , but Eps15 does bind AP2 . Eps15 appears to have an extended conformation and forms linear oligomers ( 52 ) . The amino acid sequence of Eps15 predicts that its central domain is like - ly to form a coiled coil . The NH 2 - terminal domain has three repeats of an ; 100 – amino acid motif that has been termed the EH do - main ( 53 ) . EH domains are protein recogni - tion modules that mostly bind sequences con - taining NPF ( 21 ) , although some may recog - nize other motifs ( 54 ) . The structure of an EH domain of Eps15 has been solved with NMR ( 55 ) ( Fig . 2 ) and consists of a pair of EF hand motifs , one of which binds a calcium ion . The domain has a single NPF binding site . The calcium ion is likely to have a structural rather than a regulatory role , but a tryptophan residue located in a hydrophobic pocket is critical for binding NPF . Several NPF motif – containing proteins have been implicated in endocytosis , including Epsin , CALM , and nonneuronal isoforms of synaptojanin . Epsin ( 33 ) contains three NPF motifs in its COOH - terminal region and binds to Eps15 . Epsin is homologous to intersectin binding protein 2 ( IBP2 ) , which also has three NPF motifs in its COOH - terminus . IBP2 binds to intersec - tin ( a homolog of Drosophila DAP160 and the mammalian Ese proteins ) , which has two EH domains ( 56 ) and multiple SH3 domains , several of which bind to the pro - line - rich domains of dynamin and synapto - janin ( Fig . 3 ) . Many protein - protein interactions are achieved with various combinations of inter - action modules . Thus , SH3 domains interact with proline - rich domains in their binding partners , and side - chain variations of these domains give rise to specificity . EH domain – NPF interactions have low affinity , and resi - dues around the NPF motif help to provide specificity ( 54 ) . Many proteins contain mul - tiple NPF repeats that could allow the binding of several EH domains and might increase binding affinity . However , the close proxim - ity of some of these repeats would likely prevent multiple EH domain interactions . The networks of contacts between clath - rin - associated proteins , some of which are discussed above and others that are illustrated in Fig . 3 , indicate the complexity of clathrin cage assembly . Not only are there a large number of proteins involved , but the connec - tivity of each of the proteins is achieved in multiple ways . Many of the interactions might appear redundant ( for example , am - phiphysin can associate directly with clathrin as well as through AP2 ) . However , the vari - ous modes through which these interactions occur may coordinate and “fine - tune” the process of endocytosis , serving to efficiently recruit , in spatially and temporally distinct ways , the different proteins required at each stage of the cycle . Conclusions A high - resolution three - dimensional view of the clathrin coat is beginning to emerge . CCV formation is a complex process dependent on , and regulated by , the activities of a set of cytosolic proteins that are recruited through various protein - protein and protein - lipid in - teractions . Phosphorylation and dephospho - rylation are emerging as key regulators of these interactions and of the activities of the proteins ( 37 ) , but the precise order in which the different components act at each step of the process remains to be solved . Of all the coat - mediated transport events characterized so far , endocytic CCVs are unique in their amount of complexity . This may reflect a need for a higher degree of control to coor - dinate clathrin - mediated endocytosis in , for example , the rapid recovery of synaptic ves - icle membrane or cellular responses to envi - ronmental stimuli . The developments seen over the past couple of years will continue ; new insights and structures will be published soon . The challenge for the new century will be to understand how these structures interact to drive endocytosis . References and Notes 1 . M . S . Robinson , Trends Cell Biol . 7 , 99 ( 1997 ) ; B . S .
