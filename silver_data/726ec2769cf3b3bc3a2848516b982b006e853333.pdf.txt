Müller 1 * Integrin - mediated mechanosensing of the extracellular environment allows cells to control adhesion and signalling . Whether cells sense and respond to force immediately upon ligand - binding is unknown . Here , we report that during adhesion initiation , ﬁbroblasts respond to mechanical load by strengthening integrin - mediated adhesion to ﬁbronectin ( FN ) in a biphasic manner . In the ﬁrst phase , which depends on talin and kindlin as well as on the actin nucleators Arp2 / 3 and mDia , FN - engaged α 5 β 1 integrins activate focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) and c - Src in less than 0 . 5 s to steeply strengthen α 5 β 1 - and α V - class integrin - mediated adhesion . When the mechanical load exceeds a certain threshold , ﬁbroblasts decrease adhesion and initiate the second phase , which is characterized by less steep adhesion strengthening . This unique , biphasic cellular adhesion response is mediated by α 5 β 1 integrins , which form catch bonds with FN and signal to FN - binding integrins to reinforce cell adhesion much before visible adhesion clusters are formed . S hear stress , compression , tension , and the stiﬀness of the ex - tracellular matrix ( ECM ) guide the function and form of cells and tissues 1 , 2 . Integrins are main mediators of cell adhesion to the ECM , where they sense mechanical properties and translate them into biochemical signals to regulate cellular processes that are crucial for development , tissue homeostasis and pathology 3 – 5 . In mammals , 24 integrin heterodimers are formed from 18 α - and 8 β - subunits 6 . Usually cells co - express several integrins that specifically bind to small amino acid sequences of ECM proteins . The Arg - Gly - Asp ( RGD ) sequence is found in diﬀerent ECM pro - teins , including fibronectin ( FN ) , where it associates with α 5 β 1 and α V - class integrins 6 – 8 . α 5 β 1 integrins can additionally bind the Pro - His - Ser - Arg - Asn ( PHSRN ) synergy site of the 9th type III repeat of FN to establish firm adhesion 9 . After ligand - binding , integrins cluster in ≥ 60 s ( refs 10 , 11 ) , and recruit a cohort of intracellular proteins at their cytoplasmic tails that constitute an adhesome . The adhesome stabilizes the binding of the integrin ectodomain to the ligand , connects integrins to the actin cytoskeleton , and initiates sig - nalling . The composition of the adhesome depends on the engaged integrin and the extent of coupling to the actomyosin - mediated pulling forces 12 – 14 . These forces induce conformational changes in adhesome proteins , including talin , vinculin , focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , tyrosine - protein kinase Src and p130Cas that expose cryptic protein binding sites and / or induce catalytic activities 15 – 18 . Together , intracellular tension and conformational changes of adhesome pro - teins are required to mature short - lived nascent adhesions into focal adhesions 5 , 19 . Integrins withstand strong extra - and intracellularly generated forces . α 5 β 1 integrins accomplish this task by switching from a relaxed , low - aﬃnity state for ligand - binding to a tensioned , high - aﬃnity state 20 with prolonged integrin – ligand bond lifetime 21 . This catch bond behaviour 22 was demonstrated with recombinant integrin ectodomains in vitro 21 . However , it remains unclear if other integrins form catch bonds , if catch bonds occur in the native cellular environment , and in which time range integrins strengthen cell adhesion in response to mechanical cues . We addressed these questions by studying fibroblasts initiating adhesion to FN . Using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) - based single - cell force spectroscopy ( SCFS ) , we characterized the adhesion forceatwhichfibroblastsstartdetachingfromFNandruptureforcesatwhichsingleintegrinsunbindligand 23 , 24 . We found that already at the onset of adhesion ( (cid:39) 2 s ) , fibroblasts respond to mechanical load by strengthening adhesion in two distinct phases using diﬀerent mechanisms . FN - ligated integrins respond to mechanical load The mechanical environment influences the initiation , maturation and function of integrin - mediated adhesion sites in cells 14 , 25 , 26 . We used AFM - based SCFS ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) to determine the impact of mechanical load on FN adherent mouse fibroblasts lacking the expression of all integrins ( pan integrin knockout ; pKO ) , and reconstituted with FN - binding α V - class integrins ( pKO - α V ) , α 5 β 1 integrins ( pKO - β 1 ) , or both integrin classes ( pKO - α V / β 1 ) 14 . The cell surface levels of integrins and the cell size of the fibroblastlineswerecomparabletothoseofparentalwild - type ( WT ) fibroblasts 14 ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . For SCFS , a single fibroblast was attached to a concanavalin A ( ConA ) - coated tip - less cantilever and optically monitored to assure a round morphology throughout the experiments . The fibroblast was lowered onto a FN fragment ( FNIII7 - 10 ) - coated substrate to initiate adhesion for 5 s . While separating the fibroblast and substrate , the maximum deflection of the cantilever measured the adhesion force the fibroblast withstood before detaching from the substrate ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . To increase the mechanical load to the substrate - adhering fibroblast , the retraction speed of the cantilever was increased . pKO - α V / β 1 and WT fibroblasts markedly strengthened adhesion force to FNIII7 - 10 in response to the retraction speed increasing from 1 to 5 µ m s − 1 . This strengthening was defined by the slope of adhesion forces ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . At 6 µ m s − 1 , the adhesion force decreased , while further elevating the retraction speed increased adhesion forces with a smaller slope . Since this biphasic adhesion strengthening occurred with single fibroblasts 1 Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule ( ETH ) Zürich , Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering , 4058 Basel , Switzerland . 2 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , Estructura de Reserca Interdisciplinar en Biotechnologia i Biomedicina , Universitat de València , 46100 Burjassot , Spain . 3 Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry , Department of Molecular Medicine , 82152 Martinsried , Germany . * e - mail : daniel . mueller @ bsse . ethz . ch NATUREMATERIALS | ADVANCE ONLINE PUBLICATION | www . nature . com / naturematerials 1 © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

Single ﬁbroblasts were attached to a ConA - or VN - coated ( 50 µ gml − 1 VN ) cantilever , approached to the substrate - coated support , and after 5s contact time retracted vertically to measure the adhesion force between ﬁbroblast and support . Adhesion forces of individual ﬁbroblasts ( dots ) and their mean ( red bar ) are given for each retraction speed . Adhesion forces at different retraction speeds are referred to as speed - dependent adhesion proﬁles . ( n ) denotes the number of ﬁbroblasts probed for each condition . The adhesion proﬁle of pKO - α V / β 1 ﬁbroblasts adhering to FNIII7 - 10 substrates ( a ) , is displayed in grey in the other panels as reference . For statistical analysis , the slopes of adhesion forces ( adhesion strengthening ) in the ﬁrst ( 1 – 5 µ ms − 1 ) and second ( 6 – 20 µ ms − 1 ) phase were compared with the respective slopes of pKO - α V / β 1 ﬁbroblasts attached to ConA - coated cantilevers . Slopes were compared based on difference in differences . Differences of adhesion forces between 5 and 6 µ ms − 1 were evaluated applying the Mann – Whitney test . P values are given above the graphs . irrespective of repeated retractions at randomized or fixed speeds ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , we excluded an involvement of mechanical memory for this eﬀect . Importantly , we observed very low adhesion force and no biphasic adhesion response of pKO fibroblasts to FN , pKO - α V / β 1 fibroblasts to FN lacking the RGD motif ( FNIII7 - 10 (cid:49) RGD ) , and pKO - α V / β 1 fibroblasts treated with EDTA ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . To investigate the contribution of α V - class and α 5 β 1 integrins to the biphasic adhesion response , we quantified the adhesion force of pKO - α V and pKO - β 1 fibroblasts to FN ( Fig . 1c ) . The adhesion of both pKO - α V and pKO - β 1 fibroblasts was lower than of pKO - α V / β 1 fibroblasts . Importantly , only pKO - β 1 fibroblasts showed a biphasic adhesion response , although much less pronounced . Taken together , fibroblasts adhering to FN for only 5 s use α 5 β 1 integrins to biphasically strengthen adhesion in response to mechanical load , and co - expression of α V - class integrins amplifies this eﬀect . FN - bound α 5 β 1 and α V - class integrins work in proximity To test whether non - ligated α 5 β 1 integrins can induce the biphasic adhesion response , we adhered ConA - bound pKO - α V / β 1 fibrob - lasts to VN - coated substrates ( Fig . 1d ) and found a monophasic response similar to that of pKO - α V fibroblasts adhering to FN ( Fig . 1c ) . We also tested whether both FN - binding integrin classes cooperate across the cell or require proximity to amplify the biphasic adhesion strengthening by α 5 β 1 integrins . Sequestering α V - class integrins of pKO - α V / β 1 fibroblasts to VN - coated cantilevers pre - vented them from binding to VN - coated substrates at the opposite fibroblast surface ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) , and resulted in an adhe - sion behaviour to FN ( Fig . 1d ) , resembling ConA - bound pKO - β 1 fibroblasts adhering to FN ( Fig . 1c ) . Thesedatashowthat α 5 β 1integrinsmustbindFNtobiphasically strengthen adhesion in response to mechanical load , and that α V - class integrins amplify this response when they are close to α 5 β 1 integrins . α 5 β 1 integrins transition from catch to slip bonds To investigate how integrins unbind from FN in response to mechanical load , we analysed their single rupture events ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) 23 , 24 in force – distance curves recorded upon detaching fibroblasts from FNIII7 - 10 ( Fig . 2 ) . The rupture forces of α V - class integrins continuously increased on increasing the retraction speed from 1 to 20 µ m s − 1 . In contrast , the median rupture forces of α 5 β 1 integrins increased at retraction speeds from 1 to 5 µ m s − 1 , dropped from 6 to 8 µ m s − 1 and increased again from 10 to 20 µ m s − 1 . The median rupture forces of pKO - α V / β 1 fibroblasts , expressing α V - class and α 5 β 1 integrins , closely followed the combination of rupture forces of the two integrin classes ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) .

Rupture forces required to separate single integrin – FN bonds were taken from single rupture events detected in the force – distance curves acquired for Fig . 1 . The analysis of such events , which describes the force required to rupture individual bonds formed between actin bound integrins and FN 23 , 24 , is exempliﬁed in Supplementary Fig . 1 . Rupture forces of single integrin – FN bonds ( grey dots ) , their median ( red bars ) and the interquartile range are given . ( n ) denotes the number of single unbinding events analysed . Statistical signiﬁcance of median differences to the preceeding slower retraction speed was tested using the Mann – Whitney Test . P values are given above the graphs . α 5 β 1 integrin - FNIII7 - 10 bond supports recent findings reporting that recombinant α 5 β 1 integrins bound to FN transition from catch to slip bond behaviour 21 , 27 . Integrin activation alters adhesion response To test whether the integrin activation state influences the biphasic adhesion behaviour of fibroblasts , we activated all integrins at the cell surface using Mn 2 + . Whereas the Mn 2 + - treatment increased the adhesion force in the first phase ( ≤ 5 µ m s − 1 ) of pKO - β 1 and pKO - α V fibroblasts to FNIII7 - 10 , the adhesion forces of pKO - α V / β 1 remained unaﬀected ( Fig . 3a ) . Mn 2 + - treated pKO - β 1 and pKO - α V , but not pKO - α V / β 1 , fibroblasts increased adhesion force more steeply with increasing mechanical load . Furthermore , Mn 2 + - activated pKO - α V / β 1 and pKO - β 1 fibroblasts lacked the characteristic drop of adhesion force at the transition between both phases . All three fibroblasts lines did not further increase the adhesion that was reached at the end of first phase . The ability of Mn 2 + to aﬀect adhesion forces of pKO - α V / β 1 fibroblasts in the second but not in the first phase indicates that in the absence ofMn 2 + fibroblasts respondto mechanical load byengaging additional integrins in the first phase , which does not occur in the second phase . To further test whether ligand - induced integrin activation modulates adhesion strengthening , we shortened the contact time of pKO - α V / β 1 fibroblasts with FN from 5 to 3 , 2 and 1 s and measured their adhesion force depending on the mechanical load ( Fig . 3b ) . At 3 s contact time , adhesion forces and biphasic adhesion response were similar to those observed at 5 s . At 2 s , adhesion forces reduced , withabiphasicadhesionresponsebeingstillobservable . However , at 1 sthecharacteristicdropofthebiphasicadhesionresponsewaslost , indicating that mechanical stimulation regulates very early stages of integrin - mediated adhesion formation of fibroblasts . Next , we extended the contact times of pKO - α V / β 1 fibroblasts with FN to 20 , 35 and 50 s and measured their adhesion force depending on the mechanical load ( Fig . 3c ) . With increasing contact time , adhesion force and slope increased in the first phase . However , at the transition of both phases , the adhesion dropped with diﬀerent magnitudes . After 20 s , the drop of adhesion force was augmented compared to fibroblasts adhering for 5 s ( Fig . 3c ) and the slope of adhesion forces in the second phase was less steep compared to the first phase . After 35 s , the adhesion drop was still apparent , but less pronounced than after 20 s ( Fig . 3c ) , whereas after 50 s the characteristic adhesion drop was barely visible and the fibroblasts entered an enhanced adhesion force plateau in the second phase . The drop of adhesion force at the transition from the first to the second phase decreases with increasing contact time , which is due to integrin engagement rather than clustering , since integrins cluster at extended contact times ≥ 60 s ( ref . 10 ) . Finally , we determined the contribution of α 5 β 1 and α V - class integrins to the mechanical load - dependent adhesion strengthening at higher contact times to FN - coated substrates ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) , where pKO - β 1 fibroblasts developed higher adhesion forces compared to pKO - α V fibroblasts . Furthermore , pKO - β 1 fibroblasts strengthened adhesion biphasically in response to load , which was not the case for pKO - α V fibroblasts . The load - dependent biphasic adhesion strengthening of pKO - β 1 fibroblasts at 20 and 35 s contact time was similar to pKO - α V / β 1 fibroblasts and exceeded adhesion forces of pKO - α V / β 1 fibroblasts at 50 s . These results show that within the contact times tested , α 5 β 1 integrins but not α V - class trigger the engagement of additional integrins to the substrate . The similarity of the biphasic responses of pKO - β 1 fibroblasts at higher contact times and of pKO - α V / β 1 fibroblasts at 5 s contact time suggest that FN - bound α 5 β 1 integrins respond to mechanical load by triggering the engagement of additional integrins . Biphasic response requires integrins coupling to actin Talin and kindlin binding to integrins is required to maintain the active state of integrins 28 . We probed the adhesion of talin - 1 - and - 2 - deficient ( talin KO ) and kindlin - 1 - and - 2 - deficient ( kindlin KO ) fibroblasts 28 to FNIII7 - 10 in response to mechanical load after 5 s contact time ( Fig . 4a ) . Compared to pKO - α V / β 1 fibroblasts , both fibroblast lines expressed similar levels of FN - binding integrins on theirsurface ( SupplementaryFig . 2 ) . However , individualfibroblasts were smaller , which could influence the contact area between fibroblasts and substrate , and consequently the magnitude of the NATUREMATERIALS | ADVANCE ONLINE PUBLICATION | www . nature . com / naturematerials © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

While the adhesion forces of talin KO fibroblasts were lower in the first phase , in the second phase they were similar to those of pKO - α V / β 1 ( Fig . 4a ) and talin control fibroblasts 28 ( Supplementary Fig . 8a ) . Mn 2 + was unable to induce biphasic adhesion behaviour of talin KO fibroblasts ( Fig . 4a ) , indicating that talin is required for the first , but not for the second phase of the biphasic adhesion strengthening . Kindlin KO fibroblasts strengthened adhesion biphasically , although the adhesion forces were generally lower compared to pKO - α V / β 1 fibroblasts ( Fig . 4b ) .

P values are given above the graphs . Inhibition of RhoA , regulating the myosin II - mediated contractility of the actomyosin cortex , as well as inhibition of this contractility with blebbistatin or Y27632 retained the characteristic biphasic adhesion response ( Fig . 4d ) . These results indicate that the biphasic adhesion response of fibroblasts to mechanical load requires talin - mediated integrin link - age to Arp2 / 3 assembled F - actin but not actomyosin contractility . Adhesion strengthening requires FAK , Src and synergy site In shear - stress - dependent integrin activation , PI3 kinase and c - Src rapidly ( 10 and 0 . 3 s , respectively ) phosphorylate 30 , 31 . Therefore , we tested their role as well as other proteins participating in integrin activation , including Rap1 and FAK , in the biphasic adhesion response of pKO - α V / β 1 fibroblasts . Using chemical perturbations , we found that FAK and Src activities are necessary to establish the adhesion force of the first phase and the biphasic adhesion response ( Fig . 5a , b and Supplementary Fig . 8b ) . However , perturbing either kinase did not interfere with the second phase of adhesion strengthening . Inhibition of PI3 kinase decreased the adhesion force for all retraction speeds , while the biphasic adhesion response remained ( Fig . 5c ) . Interestingly , inhibition of the talin - activating small GTPase Rap1 ( ref . 32 ) neither influenced the adhesion force nor the biphasic adhesion strengthening ( Fig . 5d ) . While the biphasic adhesion response of pKO - β 1 fibroblasts remained unchanged upon Src inhibition , perturbation of FAK decreased adhesion forces and abolished the biphasic adhesion response ( Fig . 5e , f ) . The synergy site of FN is required for α 5 β 1 integrins to mechanically activate FAK 20 . Thus , we characterized the response of pKO - α V / β 1 and pKO - β 1 fibroblasts adhering to a synergy site - mutated FN fragment ( FNIII7 - 10mSyn ) to mechanical load . The adhesion strength of both fibroblast lines as well as rupture forces of single α 5 β 1 integrins in the first phase reduced and the biphasic adhesion strengthening disappeared ( Fig . 5g and Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . These experiments indicate that α 5 β 1 integrins must bind the FN synergy site to form catch bonds and to engage additional integrins . Whereas FAK and Src are critically involved in the first phase of the biphasic adhesion strengthening , PI3K plays a general role in adhesion strengthening . Discussion FN - binding α 5 β 1 and α V - class integrins assemble mixed adhesion sites where they cooperate to probe extracellular properties and regulate cell adhesion 14 , 25 , 33 . However , it is not known whether and how the two integrin classes respond to mechanical load before they assemble adhesion plaques . We found that during adhesion initiation , fibroblasts adhere biphasically in response to mechanical load . In the first phase , at cantilever retraction speeds ≤ 5 µ m s − 1 , fibroblasts expressing both α 5 β 1 and α V - class integrins steeply strengthen adhesion with increasing mechanical load . At a retraction speed of 6 µ m s − 1 , adhesion markedly drops and fibroblasts initiate the second phase to increase adhesion again with rising mechanical load , but less steeply compared to the 6 © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

Mn 2 + - activation of integrins does not aﬀect the first phase of adhesion strengthening , but plateaus the second phase at high adhesion forces . This indicates that in the first phase fibroblasts engage additional integrins in response to mechanical load , whereas above a certain threshold , in the second phase , this ‘mechanoactivation’ of integrins fails . Our experiments show that α 5 β 1 integrins actively respond to mechanical load by regulating fibroblast adhesion and engaging additional integrins binding to FN . In fibroblasts , single α 5 β 1 integrins binding to FN transition from catch to slip bond behaviour at approximately 39 pN , which corresponds to values ( > 30 pN ) found for recombinant α 5 β 1 integrin ectodomains 21 . To establish catch bonds , α 5 β 1 integrins are believed to simultaneously bind RGD and synergy sites of FN 9 , 20 . Indeed , disruption of the synergy site abolishes the biphasic response of pKO - α V / β 1 and pKO - β 1 fibroblasts . We hence speculate that the load - dependent integrin crosstalk initiated by α 5 β 1 integrins correlates with their catch bond behaviour . In our experiments α V - class integrins do not actively regulate initial fibroblast adhesion when loaded . However , FN - bound α V - class integrins withstand higher forces before unbinding than α 5 β 1 integrins , indicating that bearing a higher load retains them longer in mechanically stressed adhesion sites 14 , 34 , 35 . It has been speculated that α V - class integrins may form stronger catch bonds than α 5 β 1 integrins 14 . We did not observe a transition of bond properties within the range of retraction speeds investigated , and hence cannot exclude catch bond behaviour . It is conceivable that upon extension of the contact times , which allow integrin clustering and assembly of adhesomes , α V - class integrins may modulate their bond properties diﬀerently . We recently showed that α V - class integrins have higher bind - ing rates than α 5 β 1 integrins and successfully compete with α 5 β 1 integrins to bind FN 29 . Our findings suggest that few α 5 β 1 integrins engaging to FN are suﬃcient to respond to mechanical load and to reinforce fibroblast adhesion by engaging additional FN - binding integrins of both classes . Although α V - class integrins show higher NATUREMATERIALS | ADVANCE ONLINE PUBLICATION | www . nature . com / naturematerials © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

This observation suggests that in the absence of α V - class integrins , α 5 β 1 integrins either are more rapidly recruited to bind ligand , or their F - actin linkage stabilizes integrin – ligand bonds . However , the exact mech - anistic basis of this observation remains to be elucidated . We estimate that fibroblasts regulate adhesion in response to mechanical load within 0 . 5 s ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . Fibroblasts establish the biphasic adhesion response at the onset of initiating adhesion to FN ( (cid:39) 2 s ) . Hence , the load - dependent adhesion reinforcement relies on rapid signalling of mechanically loaded α 5 β 1 integrins to engage additional FN - binding integrins . In line with previous reports , we identify talin as mechanosensor in the biphasic adhesion response , which is required for integrin engagement and subsequent adhesion maturation 28 , 32 , 36 – 39 . Although fibroblast adhesion reduced in the absence of kindlin , the biphasic adhesion response remained evident . These findings suggest that fibroblasts require talin to respond to mechanical load and kindlin to strengthen adhesion in response to mechanical cues 28 , 40 . In line witharoleofkindlintorecruittheArp2 / 3complextoearlyadhesion sites , Arp2 / 3 was found to be essential to strengthen adhesion in response to mechanical load , whereas mDia was of general impor - tance for early adhesion formation 29 . Our results also suggest a cen - tral role for the catalytic function of FAK , which can be activated by mechanical load 20 , 27 . Additionally , FAK was shown to recruit talin to nascent integrin - containing adhesion sites , which in turn promotes integrin – ligand engagement 41 . Similarly , c - Src is also involved in integrin – ligand engagement in response to mechanical stimulation , probably by transducing signals from α 5 β 1 to α V β 3 integrins . The adhesion modulation in response to mechanical load at the onset of adhesion may be important at the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts , where ligand - bound integrins anchor membrane protrusions to ECM proteins . Interestingly , active α 5 β 1 integrins complexing with FAK , Src and talin are internalized from stable adhesions and then recycled back to the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts 42 , where newly formed adhesion sites quickly reinforce in response to mechanical load . Similar processes may operate in other systems such as platelets , which adhere with diﬀerent integrin classes to ECM proteins , including FN , fibrinogen , or the von - Willebrand factor , during clotting .

Parental ( WT ) 14 , pKO - α V / β 1 ( ref . 14 ) , pKO - α V 14 , pKO - β 1 ( ref . 14 ) , pKO 14 , talin KO 28 , talin crtl 28 and kindlin KO 28 fibroblasts were provided and identified by R . Fässler and in this work varified ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM GlutaMAX ( Gibco - Life technologies ) containing 100units ml − 1 penicillin ( Gibco - Life technologies ) , 100 µ gml − 1 streptomycin ( Gibco - Life technologies ) and 10 % ( v / v ) fetal calf serum ( FCS , Sigma , Steinheim ) . All fibroblast lines were tested for mycoplasma and grown on tissue culture flasks ( Jet BioFil , Guangzhou , China ) that were coated with fibronectin ( Calbiochem - Merck ) . Fibronectin fragment expression and purification . We expressed fibronectin fragment FNIII7 - 10 and RGD - deleted FNIII7 - 10 ( FNIII7 - 10 (cid:49) RGD ) from plasmid pET15b - FNIII7 - 10 in Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS as described 43 . Briefly , cells were grown at 37 ◦ C in Lennox L broth ( Invitrogen ) with 100 µ gml − 1 ampicillin ( Sigma ) . At optical density ( OD ) 600 = 0 . 6 , 1mM isopropyl thiogalactose ( IPTG , Sigma ) was used to induce protein expression . After 4h , cells were pelleted , resuspended in buﬀer ( 20mM Tris - HCl , 150mM NaCl , pH8 . 0 ) , and later broken by sonication . Ultracentrifugation at 40 , 000 g was applied for 45min to remove cell debris . Soluble protein fractions were bound to nickel - nitrilotriacetic acid resin ( Protino Ni - NTA Agarose , MACHEREY - NAGEL ) for 1h at 4 ◦ C . Then , the resin was loaded onto a column and washed with buﬀer ( 20mM Tris - HCl , 150mM NaCl , 10mM imidazole , pH8 . 0 ) . Fibronectin fragments were eluted with elution buﬀer ( 20mM Tris - HCl , 150mM NaCl , 500mM imidazole , pH8 . 0 ) . Thereafter , we pooled the peak fractions and dialysed them against imidazole free buﬀer ( 20mM Tris - HCl , 150mM NaCl , pH8 . 0 ) . Using dialysing buﬀer , the protein concentration was adjusted to 1 . 0mgml − 1 , the purified protein was aliquoted and stored at − 20 ◦ C . Integrin surface expression level and cell size determination . Fibroblasts were grown in six - well plates ( Thermo Scientific ) to confluency of ∼ 80 % and serum - starved ( DMEM Glutamax , 100unitsml − 1 penicillin and 100 µ gml − 1 streptomycin ) overnight prior to experiments . To detach fibroblasts , they were washed with PBS and incubated with 200 µ l of 0 . 25 % ( w / v ) trypsin / EDTA ( Sigma ) for 2min . After detachment , fibroblasts were suspended in SCFS media ( DMEM high glucose with 20mM HEPES ) supplemented with 1 % ( v / v ) FCS . Thereafter , fibroblasts were pelleted and resuspended in serum - free SCFS media . 300 , 000 fibroblasts were incubated at 37 ◦ C for 30min ( ref . 43 ) . Then , fibroblasts were washed twice with flow cytometry buﬀer ( PBS supplemented with 0 . 1 % BSA ( w / v ) and 2mM EDTA ) . Pelleted fibroblasts were resuspended in 60 µ l flow cytometry buﬀer supplemented with 3 µ l of phycoerythrin ( PE ) - labelled antibodies against integrin subunits α V ( 551187 , Becton Dickinson ( BD ) AG ) , α 5 ( Cat . Nr . 557447 , BD AG ) , β 1 ( Cat . Nr . 102207 , BioLegend ) or β 3 ( Cat . Nr . 12 - 0611 - 81 , Life Technologies ) . After fibroblasts were incubated with the antibodies for 30min at 4 ◦ C , they were washed twice with 300 µ l flow cytometry buﬀer and their fluorescence intensity characterized using LSRFortessa ( BD AG ) . For cell size characterization , fibroblasts lines were serum - starved overnight . Adherent fibroblasts were detached with 200 µ l of 0 . 25 % ( w / v ) trypsin / EDTA ( Sigma ) for 2min and suspended in SCFS media containing 1 % ( v / v ) FCS . Fibroblasts lines were pelleted and resuspended in 100 – 300 µ l of SCFS media . Fibroblasts sizes were characterized using an automated cell counter ( Countess II , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) with standard protocols from the manufacturer . Coating of AFM cantilever and Petri dishes . Cantilevers ( NP - O , Bruker ) were plasma treated for ∼ 5min and subsequently incubated overnight in ConA ( 2mgml − 1 , Sigma ) or vitronectin ( 50 µ gml − 1 ) in PBS at 4 ◦ C ( ref . 44 ) . VN stock solutions ( 50 µ gml − 1 ) were diluted to final concentrations of 5 , 0 . 5 or 0 . 05 µ gml − 1 in 2mgml − 1 ConA in PBS . To allow the eﬃcient characterization of cell adhesion to diﬀerent substrates , a polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) mask with four segments was attached to the glass surface of a Petri dish ( 35mm FluoroDish , World Precision Instruments ) 45 . The PDMS - segmented glass surfaces were then incubated overnight either with FNIII7 - 10 ( 50 µ gml − 1 ) , FNIII7 - 10 (cid:49) RGD ( 50 µ gml − 1 ) , FNIII7 - 10 (cid:49) syn ( 50 µ gml − 1 ) , or vitronectin ( 50 µ gml − 1 ) in PBS at 4 ◦ C . Single - cell force spectroscopy ( SCFS ) . For SCFS , we used an AFM ( NanoWizard II , JPK Instruments , Berlin , Germany ) having a CellHesion module ( JPK Instruments ) mounted on an inverted microscope ( Observer . Z , Zeiss ) . Using a Petri dish heater ( JPK Instruments ) , fibroblasts were kept at 37 ◦ C . V - shaped , 200 µ m long , tip - less silicon nitride cantilevers ( NP - O , Bruker ) having nominal spring constants of 0 . 06Nm − 1 were used for SCFS . The spring constant of every single cantilever was measured before SCFS using the thermal noise method 46 . Overnight serum - starved ( DMEM Glutamax , 100unitsml − 1 penicillin and 100 µ gml − 1 streptomycin ) fibroblasts were cultured in 24 - well plates ( Thermo Scientific ) up to a confluency of ∼ 80 % . To detach fibroblasts , they were first washed with PBS and incubated with 200 µ l of 0 . 25 % ( w / v ) trypsin / EDTA ( Sigma ) for 2min . Suspended fibroblasts were diluted in SCFS media supplemented with 1 % ( v / v ) FCS and pelleted . Finally , fibroblasts were resuspended in serum - free SCFS media . Fibroblasts were allowed to recover from trypsin treatment for at least 30min ( ref . 43 ) . Petri dishes were washed with SCFS media . Fibroblast suspensions were added into dishes with substrate - coated glass supports . Rounded fibroblasts with similar size were optically selected for adhesion measurements . Single fibroblasts were attached at the end of a calibrated , ConA - coated cantilever by approaching the cantilever with a speed of 10 µ ms − 1 onto a fibroblast until a contact force of 3nN was reached . After a contact time of 5s , the fibroblast adhered to the cantilever , which was retracted by ≥ 50 µ m to fully detach the fibroblast from the glass support . To ensure firm attachment to the cantilever , fibroblasts adhering to the cantilever were incubated for 5min before starting cell adhesion experiments . To measure cell adhesion forces , cantilever - bound fibroblasts were approached onto the substrate at a constant speed of 5 µ ms − 1 until a contact force of 1nN was reached . Upon reaching the contact force , the cantilever height was maintained at constant height to allow contact times of 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 20 , 35 or 50s . Subsequently , after the contact time , fibroblasts were fully detached from the substrate by retracting the cantilevers at a set speed ranging from 1 to 20 µ ms − 1 for > 90 µ m . Fibroblasts were allowed to recover from the detachment process for at least the contact time before probing the adhesion force of a diﬀerent retraction speed . Retraction speeds were randomized for all experiments if not stated diﬀerently . Single fibroblast were used to probe adhesion forces once for all retraction speeds or until morphological changes ( that is , spreading ) were observed by optical microscopy ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . After this , a new cantilever was taken to select a new fibroblast . To achieve statistically firm results , the adhesion of at least 10 fibroblasts was characterized per retraction speed . Data analysis . The data processing software of the AFM ( JPK Instruments ) was used to obtain adhesion forces from force – distance curves . Rupture forces were extracted from force – distance curves by applying in - house routines ( Igor 6 , Wavemetric ) . For the analysis of single integrin bonds , force – distance curves , acquired after 5s contact time as described in the ‘SCFS’ section , were condensed to 15 , 000 points for pKO - α V and pKO - β 1 fibroblasts and to 30 , 000 points for pKO - α V / β 1 fibroblasts . Rupture events were analysed to measure the forces rupturing single integrin – FN bonds 24 , 47 . Tether events were excluded from analysis , as they depict the force required to mechanically extract a membrane tether from the cell 48 , 49 . Rupture and tether events were distinguished by the slope prior to the unbinding event , where tether plateaus had a maximum angle of ∼ 10 ◦ ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . The minimum rupture force analysed was set to 20pN . Statistical analysis . Statistical test were done in Prism ( GraphPad ) or R ( ref . 50 ) . To statistically compare load - dependent adhesion strengthening in diﬀerent conditions , linear regression analysis of recorded adhesion forces in the first ( 1 – 5 µ ms − 1 ) and second phase ( 6 – 20 µ ms − 1 ) was performed . Two - tailed P values tested the null hypothesis that slopes are identical ( parallel ) . Thereby , the P values tested the chance that randomly selected data points from both conditions would have slopes at least as diﬀerent as observed in the compared condition 51 . To compare diﬀerences in median adhesion forces , a two - tailed Mann – Whitney test was performed . In all statistical analysis , P values are given as not significant ( NS ) if P > 0 . 05 , and gradually indicated as significant if P < 0 . 05 ( ∗ ) , P < 0 . 01 ( ∗∗ ) and P < 0 . 001 ( ∗∗∗ ) . Perturbation and Mn 2 + assays . To perturb proteins , suspended fibroblasts were incubated with 20 µ M SMIFH2 ( Merck Millipore ) , 10 µ M Y27632 ( Sigma ) , 200 µ M CK666 ( Tocris Bioscience ) , 20 µ M blebbistatin ( Sigma ) , 10 µ M LY249002 ( Cell Signaling Technology ) , 1 µ M latrunculin A ( Sigma ) , 5mM EDTA ( Sigma ) , 10 and 20 µ M PP2 ( Tocris ) , 20 µ M PP1 ( Tocris ) , 10 µ M Y11 ( Tocris ) , GGTi286 ( Merck Millipore ) and 20 µ M PF573228 ( Tocris ) for 30min in SCFS media at 37 ◦ C . Fibroblasts were incubated with 2 µ M C3 toxin ( Cytoskeleton ) for 3h before any of the experiments . Perturbants were present during SCFS at the stated concentrations . All perturbants were stored at − 20 ◦ C and dissolved in DMSO—except C3 Toxin , which was dissolved in 50 % ( v / v ) glycerol . For integrin activation , fibroblasts were incubated with 0 . 5mM Mn 2 + for 30min prior to SCFS , and Mn 2 + was present in the same concentration during adhesion measurements .
