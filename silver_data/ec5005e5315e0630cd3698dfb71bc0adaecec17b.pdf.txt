This co - innervation has been shown to be crucial for neuromuscular junction morphology and functional maintenance . To improve our understanding of how sympathetic innervation affects nerve – muscle synapse homeostasis , we here used in vivo imaging , proteomic , biochemical , and microscopic approaches to compare normal and sympathectomized mouse hindlimb muscles . Live confocal microscopy revealed reduced ﬁber diameters , enhanced acetylcholine receptor turnover , and increased amounts of endo / lysosomal acetylcholine - receptor - bearing vesicles . Proteomics analysis of sympathectomized skeletal muscles showed that besides massive changes in mitochondrial , sarcomeric , and ribosomal proteins , the relative abundance of vesicular trafﬁcking markers was affected by sympathectomy . Immunoﬂuorescence and Western blot approaches corroborated these ﬁndings and , in addition , suggested local upregulation and enrichment of endo / lysosomal progression and autophagy markers , Rab 7 and p62 , at the sarcomeric regions of muscle ﬁbers and neuromuscular junctions . In summary , these data give novel insights into the relevance of sympathetic innervation for the homeostasis of muscle and neuromuscular junctions . They are consistent with an upregulation of endocytic and autophagic trafﬁcking at the whole muscle level and at the neuromuscular junction .

Traﬃcking Frontiers in Physiology | www . frontiersin . org 1 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 626707 fphys - 12 - 626707 March 7 , 2021 Time : 16 : 50 # 2 Straka et al . SNS and AChR Trafﬁcking and maturation of endosomes are regulated by Rab GTPases , which are small GTP - binding proteins . Speciﬁc Rab proteins are associated with certain stages of endocytosis . In particular , very early endosomal processing is linked to Rab 5 , with its presence found to be rate limiting in the endocytic pathway ( Bucci et al . , 1992 ) . Upon endosomal maturation , Rab 5 is exchanged by Rab 7 to reach a state of late endosomes . They are delivered to lysosomal degradation either directly ( Chavrier et al . , 1990 ; Soldati et al . , 1995 ) or via a process known as macroautophagy ( hereafter short autophagy ) ( Amaya et al . , 2015 ) . Autophagy is a specialized self - eating process of cellular components by delivering them to lysosomes ( De Duve , 1963 ) and provides a degradation route for endocytosed vesicles . Apart from Rab 7 , there are other Rab GTPases involved in facilitating the delivery of late endosome to autolysosomes ( Amaya et al . , 2015 ) . For instance , Rab 1b was required for autophagosome formation from speciﬁc sites of the ER ( Amaya et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , while Rab 11 is known to be associated with recycling endosomes and post - Golgi vesicular traﬃcking ( Lock and Stow , 2005 ; Welz et al . , 2014 ) , some studies point toward an additional role of this Rab GTPase in autophagy regulation ( Fader et al . , 2008 ; Longatti et al . , 2012 ; Szatmári et al . , 2014 ; Puri et al . , 2018 ) . At the neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) , the main signaling transmembrane receptor is acetylcholine receptor ( AChR ) . Here , at the interphase between skeletal muscle and motoneuron innervation , a high density of AChR ( roughly 10 , 000 receptors / µ m 2 ) ensures eﬃcient neuromuscular signal transmission ( Sanes and Lichtman , 2001 ) . Remodeling of the NMJ upon disturbances , such as sciatic nerve lesion , leads to reduction in AChR lifetime and fragmented morphology of the band - like appearance of rodent NMJs often described as “pretzel - shaped” ( Levitt et al . , 1980 ; Levitt and Salpeter , 1981 ; Stanley and Drachman , 1981 , 1987 ; Shyng et al . , 1991 ; Strack et al . , 2011 , 2015 ; Tu et al . , 2017 ; Vannucci et al . , 2019 ) . Changes in AChR localization , lifetime , and / or density are hallmarks of several disease states ( Fambrough et al . , 1973 ; Drachman et al . , 1980 ; Webster , 2018 ) , denervation ( Levitt et al . , 1980 ; Levitt and Salpeter , 1981 ; Stanley and Drachman , 1981 , 1987 ; Shyng et al . , 1991 ; Strack et al . , 2011 , 2015 ; Tu et al . , 2017 ; Vannucci et al . , 2019 ) , and aging ( Gonzalez - Freire et al . , 2014 ; Rudolf et al . , 2014 ; Taetzsch and Valdez , 2018 ) . AChR localization , lifetime , and / or density at NMJs are tightly correlated with regulation of endocytosis and vesicle traﬃcking ( reviewed in Rudolf and Straka , 2019 ) . Indeed , overexpression of Rab 5 or its constitutively active mutants led to an increase in AChR - positive endocytic vesicles , suggesting an involvement of Rab 5 in the endocytosis of AChR ( Wild et al . , 2016 ) . Furthermore , vesicle traﬃcking of AChR was dependent on the membrane - curvature inducing and endo / autophagosomal regulator protein Endophilin B1 ( aka SH3GLB1 or Bif 1 ) . More precisely , phosphorylation of Endophilin B1 by cyclin - dependent kinase 5 ( Cdk5 ) ( Wong et al . , 2011 ) was shown to modulate Rab 5 activity . Particularly , overexpression of a dominant - negative mutant of Cdk5 ( DN - Cdk5 ) caused a reduction of denervation - induced endocytic AChR - containing vesicles ( Wild et al . , 2016 ) . These data are consistent with the observation of a cooperative function of Cdk5 , Endophilin B1 , and Beclin1 in autophagy ( Wong et al . , 2011 ; Ishii et al . , 2019 ) . At rodent NMJs , degradation of endocytosed AChR vesicles has been shown to occur via autophagy in an Endophilin B1 and MuRF1 - dependent manner ( Khan et al . , 2014 ) . Here , colocalization of AChR - positive endocytic vesicles and autophagosomal components , like LC3 , p62 , and MuRF1 , was observed upon induction of muscle atrophy ( Khan et al . , 2014 ) . In terms of molecular signaling , AChR stability is—among others—regulated by cAMP , protein kinase A ( PKA ) , and α - calcitonin gene - related peptide ( Laufer and Changeux , 1987 ; Miles et al . , 1989 ; Shyng et al . , 1991 ; Poyner , 1992 ; Lu et al . , 1993 ; Xu and Salpeter , 1997 ; Röder et al . , 2010 ; Martinez - Pena y Valenzuela et al . , 2013 ; Machado et al . , 2019 ) . In this context , close proximity between sympathetic neurons and NMJs ( Chan - Palay et al . , 1982 ; Khan et al . , 2016 ; Rodrigues et al . , 2018 ; Straka et al . , 2018 ; Snyder - Warwick et al . , 2018 ) , and the relevance of cAMP in G - protein - coupled receptor signaling of adrenergic receptors , pointed to a potential role of sympathetic signaling in regulating AChR endocytic traﬃcking . Indeed , chemical or surgical sympathectomy led to NMJ shrinkage , and reduced membrane - bound AChR ( Khan et al . , 2016 ; Rodrigues et al . , 2018 ) . Furthermore , C2C12 myoblasts showed enhanced AChR stabilization upon application of sympathicomimetic α - adrenergic receptor agonists ( Clausen et al . , 2018 ) , corroborating an involvement of the sympathetic nervous system in AChR turnover . Fittingly , treatment with sympathicomimetics was beneﬁcial in clinical treatment of several congenital myasthenic syndromes caused by inherited mutations of NMJ proteins frequently followed by decreased AChR density ( Ohno et al . , 2002 ; Chevessier et al . , 2004 ; Bestue - Cardiel et al . , 2005 ; Lashley et al . , 2010 ; Liewluck et al . , 2011 ; Sadeh et al . , 2011 ; Wargon et al . , 2012 ; Burke et al . , 2013 ; Lorenzoni et al . , 2013 ; Tsao , 2015 ; Mulroy et al . , 2017 ; Padmanabha et al . , 2017 ) . Although changes at the NMJ were observed upon sympathectomy , it remained unclear whether the sympathetic nervous system was involved in the previously described endo / lysosomal traﬃcking of AChR - containing endosomes . To address this question , we performed proteomic analysis of sympathectomized hind limb muscles . These results are further supported by Western blot and immunoﬂuorescence analysis . Results of these combined biochemical studies revealed a regulatory function of the sympathetic nervous system on the endo / lysosomal pathway , which supports the ﬁnding of reduced membrane - bound AChR and NMJ shrinkage upon sympathectomy ( Khan et al . , 2016 ; Rodrigues et al . , 2018 ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals In the present study , adult C57BL / 10J mice were used . Animals were maintained in a local animal facility , and their use , care , and experimental protocols were approved by the commission of ethics in animal research of the national authorities in Germany ( Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe , G - 285 / 14 , June 11 , 2016 and local ethical committee ) .

Antibodies The following antibodies and dyes were used in the present study ( Table 1 ) . Anti - Tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) antibodies were chosen , since postganglionic sympathetic neurons typically release norepinephrine . Therefore , TH , which converts tyrosine into 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylalanine ( L - DOPA ) , a precursor of noradrenalin , is frequently used as a marker for sympathetic neurons ( Forsgren and Söderberg , 1987 ; Loesch et al . , 2009 ) , also in skeletal muscles ( Rodrigues et al . , 2018 ) . Clearing , Immunostaining , Imaging , and Data Processing of Diaphragms Adult diaphragms were chemically ﬁxed in freshly prepared 4 % PFA ( 5 min , RT ) . For immunostaining , a slightly modiﬁed iDISCO - based staining protocol was applied as previously described for P0 and P30 diaphragms ( Renier et al . , 2014 ; Straka et al . , 2018 ) . In brief , diaphragms were dissected and incubated in blocking and permeabilization solution ( BnP ) composed of 1 × PBS / 1 × PTwH ( 0 . 2 % tween in 1 × PBS with 10 µ g / ml heparin ) / 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 / 10 % ( vol / vol ) DMSO / 6 % ( vol / vol ) BSA ( 1 × BnP ) for 3 days followed by a 24 h - incubation in quenching solution ( 1 × PBS / 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 / 20 % DMSO / 0 . 3 M glycine ) . The primary antibody was diluted in 1 × BnP and incubated at 37 ◦ C on an orbital shaker for 4 days . Then , diaphragms were washed with 1 × PTwH for 4 - 5 days and incubated with secondary antibody , nuclear dye DAPI , and BGT ( diluted with 1 × BnP ) at 37 ◦ C for 24 h on an orbital shaker . Before imaging , another 3 days of 1 × PTwH and 24 h of ddH 2 O washing were performed . For BGT - conserving refractive index matching , a gradient of increasing glycerol concentrations ( 20 , 40 , 60 , 80 , and 88 % glycerol in ddH 2 O ) was performed . Lower glycerol concentrations ( 20 – 60 % ) were incubated for 10 h or until the tissue sunk . Higher concentrations ( 80 and 88 % ) were incubated for at least 24 h . Then , diaphragms were mounted on a glass slide embedded in 88 % of glycerol . Coverslips were ﬁxed on a glass slide using picodent twinsil ( picodent / 1 , 300 1 , 000 ) . If temperature was not speciﬁed , incubation was performed at room temperature . Images were taken using an inverted Leica TCS SP8 microscope equipped with 405 , 488 , 555 , and 633 nm lasers , and Leica HC PL APO CS2 20 × / 0 . 75 IMM CORR objective . Scan settings included 1 , 024 × 1 , 024 - pixel resolution , 0 . 75 × zoom , two times line average , pinhole setting of 1 Airy Unit , and bi - directional scan speed of 600 Hz . Voxel size was 0 . 758 × 0 . 758 × 4 . 5 or 5 µ m . Z - compensation was applied . Automated tile scan imaging was performed using the Leica LAS X 3 . 5 navigator module followed by automated stitching ( smooth mode ) . Projections of diaphragms were rendered with the 3D visualization module of LAS X . Chemical Sympathectomy Chemical sympathectomy was induced by the use of 6 - hydroxydopamine ( 6OHD ) as previously described ( Khan et al . , 2016 ) . Brieﬂy , 6OHD ( ChemCruz / sc - 203482 ) was diluted in 0 . 3 % ascorbic acid oxygen - free water and injected into the tibialis anterior muscle ( 100 mg / kg ) on alternate days for 2 weeks before tissue extraction . Tibialis anterior was chosen due to Frontiers in Physiology | www . frontiersin . org 3 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 626707 fphys - 12 - 626707 March 7 , 2021 Time : 16 : 50 # 4 Straka et al . SNS and AChR Trafﬁcking its size and position ; both these factors make it suitable for frequent injections . In addition , it is a well - studied muscle for live cell imaging ( Rudolf et al . , 2012 ) . For injection , anesthesia using inhalation of Isoﬂurane ( cp - pharma / AP / DRUGS / 220 / 96 ) was used . Control animals received intramuscular 1 × PBS injection . Right after tissue extraction , the treated muscle was cut longitudinally in two halves . One half was further processed for Western blot , whereas the other half was used in proteomic or cryosection analysis . In vivo Visualization and Measurement of Fiber Diameter , Acetylcholine Receptor Turnover Rate , and Vesicle Numbers AChR turnover was measured as described previously ( Röder et al . , 2010 ; Choi et al . , 2012 ; Khan et al . , 2014 ) . In brief , BGT 647 and BGT 555 ( 25 pmol each ) were sequentially injected into tibialis anterior muscles at a temporal distance of 10 days . After the second injection , the upper 200 µ m of these muscles were examined in vivo with an upright Leica SP2 ( Leica Microsystems ) confocal microscope using a 63 × / 1 . 2 NA water immersion objective . For the analysis of AChR turnover , 3D stacks at 512 × 512 - pixel resolution were taken of BGT 647 ( “old AChR” ) and of BGT 555 signals ( “new AChR” ) . From these images , ﬁber diameters were determined taking advantage of the slight BGT ﬂuorescence along the sarcolemma . Therefore , for each ﬁber , the maximal width in the image stack was determined and measured with ImageJ . AChR turnover rate was deﬁned by the ratio of “new AChR” and “old AChR” mean signal intensity at the NMJ . Therefore , NMJ ROIs were hand segmented in the BGT 647 channel , and the mean intensity within this ROI was measured in both channels . The number of BGT - positive vesicles was done by segmenting dot - like ﬂuorescent structures in the BGT 647 channel that were at or close around the NMJs . Proteomics For a detailed instruction of proteomic material and methods , see Supplementary Document 1 . The volcano plot in the proteomics section was created using Microsoft Excel . Generation of the proteomics heatmaps used the open - source software Perseus 1 . 6 . 2 . 3 1 . Western Blot For Western blot analysis , half tibialis anterior muscles were snap - frozen , lysed using lysis buﬀer [ 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 8 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 ( AppliChem / A1694 ) , 10 % glycerol , 5 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 Halt Protease and Phosphatase Single - Use Inhibitor Cocktail ( FisherScientiﬁc / 10025743 ) , and 0 . 5 mM PMSF ( AppliChem / A0999 ) , pH adjusted to 7 . 4 ] , and subjected to SDS - PAGE followed by Western blot analysis as already described ( Wild et al . , 2016 ; Straka et al . , 2018 ) . In each lane , equal amounts of protein were loaded ( 20 µ g ) . Chemiluminescence signals were obtained using an ECL system ( Biozym Scientiﬁc GmbH / 541004 ) in combination with a Syngene G : Box Chemi XX6 chemiluminescence imager ( Thermo 1 https : / / maxquant . net / perseus / Fisher Scientiﬁc , Schwerte , Germany ) . The analysis used ImageJ freeware image processing software 2 . Immunostaining , Imaging , and Data Processing of Muscle Cryosections For immunoﬂuorescence of cryosections , half tibialis anterior muscles were embedded in FSC 22 Clear ( 3801480 ; Leica Biosystems Nussloch GmbH , Germany ) , frozen over liquid nitrogen , and cut in 10 µ m - thick slices using Leica Cryostat CM1950 ( Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) . Sections were quickly washed with 1 × PBS , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton - X100 / PBS ( 10 min ) , washed with 1 × PBS ( 2 × 5 min ) , washed with 2 % BSA / PBS ( 5 min ) , and blocked with 2 % BSA / PBS ( 2 h , 4 ◦ C ) . Then , sections were incubated with primary antibodies in 2 % BSA / PBS ( overnight , 4 ◦ C ) . After washing with 2 % BSA / PBS ( 3 × 5 min ) , the slides were incubated with secondary antibodies and BGT in 2 % BSA / PBS ( 3 h , RT , dark ) followed by washing with 2 % BSA / PBS ( 2 × 5 min ) . Nuclei were stained using DAPI in 2 % BSA / PBS ( 5 min ) , followed by 2 × 5 min washes with 2 % BSA / PBS and 2 × 5 min washes with ddH 2 O . Slides were embedded in Mowiol . Images were acquired using the same microscope and settings as previously described for diaphragm ; see above . Image processing and analysis were conducted with ImageJ and Microsoft Excel . Therefore , all ( including weak ) NMJs were segmented using the BGT staining and variable thresholding creating regions of interest ( ROIs ) . Within these ROIs , the mean intensity was measured in either the same channel ( BGT staining ) or other channels ( Rab 7a , p62 , Cdk5 staining ) . Similarly , muscle ﬁber mean intensity was evaluated . Therefore , an ROI spanning the muscle ﬁber was drawn , and signal mean intensity within this ROI was measured in the antibody channels ( Rab 7a , p62 , and Cdk5 ) . Additionally , the ﬁber size was taken from this ROI . The mean intensity was normalized to intensity at NMJs or MF of PBS sections processed together with 6OHD - treated sections . Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel , and Student’s t - test ( two tailed , unpaired ) were performed to establish P - values . Values are reported as means ± SEM or means ± STD . Please refer to the ﬁgure legends for more information . RESULTS Sympathetic Innervation in Whole Mount Adult Diaphragm Previously , the sympathetic neural network of P0 and P30 mice was examined and an age - related increase in innervation complexity observed ( Straka et al . , 2018 ) . Using a slightly adapted experimental protocol , staining and imaging of diaphragms from 12 to 19 weeks old adult mice has now been achieved . Figure 1A shows a maximum z - projection of a large region of an adult diaphragm stained with antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase 2 https : / / imagej . nih . gov / ij / Frontiers in Physiology | www . frontiersin . org 4 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 626707 fphys - 12 - 626707 March 7 , 2021 Time : 16 : 50 # 5 Straka et al . SNS and AChR Trafﬁcking ( TH ; rb anti - TH labeled with anti - rb AlexaFluor647 , green ) and endothelial cell adhesion molecule CD31 ( CD31 ; gt anti - CD31 labeled with anti - gt AlexaFluor546 , white ) . These are markers for sympathetic neurons and blood vessels , respectively . In addition , cell nuclei were labeled with 4 (cid:48) , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI , blue ) . This corroborated the well - known association of sympathetic neurons with large blood vessels ( reviewed in Di Bona et al . , 2019 ) . Figure 1B depicts a side view of the same diaphragm . For clarity , nuclear and CD31 signals were omitted here . This image demonstrates that the entire diaphragm with a thickness of roughly 500 µ m was well penetrated by the light microscope and that the sympathetic innervation was present throughout . Further , concentration on details demonstrated ample ramiﬁcations of sympathetic neurons that were often found initiating from major branches of blood vessels ( Figure 1C ; shown region is boxed in Figure 1A ; exemplary sympathetic ramiﬁcations branching from large blood vessels , see arrowheads ) and then ran along muscle ﬁbers and small blood vessels ( Figure 1D ; shown region is boxed in Figure 1C ; exemplary sympathetic ﬁbers running along small blood vessels , see arrowheads ) . Next , the correlation between NMJs and sympathetic innervation was addressed in diﬀerent diaphragm regions , as indicated in Figure 1E , boxes labeled ( a ) and ( b ) . The ﬁrst region was stained with rb anti - TH antibody and anti - rb AlexaFluor647 ( green , Figures 1F , G ) and ﬂuorescent α - bungarotoxin AlexaFluor 555 ( BGT 555 ; red , Figures 1F , G ) . BGT is a marker of nicotinic AChR . This conﬁrmed a close distance between NMJs and sympathetic neurons , but showed no plaque - like enrichment of anti - TH signals at the NMJ region , as previously observed for some hindleg muscles ( Straka et al . , 2018 ) . In contrast to the highly branched sympathetic innervation pattern , motoneurons , stained with antibodies against neuroﬁlament ( rb anti - neuroﬁlament labeled with anti - rb AlexaFluor488 ; green , Figures 1H , I ) and synaptophysin ( gp anti - synaptophysin labeled with anti - gp AlexaFluor555 ; white , Figures 1H , I ) , traversed the muscle in nerve bundles to reach the synapse band , roughly in the central part of the muscle . Chemical Sympathectomy Increases Acetylcholine Receptor Turnover and Number of Endo / Lysosomal AChR Vesicles As previously shown , both , chemical and surgical ablation of sympathetic neurons resulted in reduced AChR presence in membranes ( Khan et al . , 2016 ; Rodrigues et al . , 2018 ) , suggesting an altered AChR turnover under these conditions . To investigate this aspect , live imaging of mouse tibialis anterior muscles in the absence or presence of chemical sympathectomy was performed . Therefore , chemical sympathectomy was applied as previously described ( Khan et al . , 2016 ) . Brieﬂy , 6 - hydroxy dopamine ( 6OHD ) was injected into mouse hindlimb tibialis anterior for 2 weeks every other day . Similar to previous reports ( Akaaboune et al . , 1999 ; Bruneau et al . , 2005 ; Röder et al . , 2009 , 2010 ; Choi et al . , 2012 ; Khan et al . , 2014 , 2016 ) , stability of AChR was addressed using a sequential labeling approach , where old and newly formed pools of AChR were marked with BGT 647 and BGT 555 , respectively . Subsequent in vivo confocal analysis showed that upon sympathectomy , the relative amount of BGT 555 staining increased over that of BGT 647 ( Figure 2A ) . Quantitative analysis conﬁrmed a strong reduction in ﬁber diameter upon sympathectomy as observed previously ( Khan et al . , 2016 ; Figure 2B ) . Quantiﬁcation of relative levels of BGT 555 / BGT 647 showed an enhanced AChR turnover ( Figure 2C ) . In addition , the number of BGT - positive puncta per NMJ was roughly doubled ( Figure 2D ) , suggesting an increased endo / lysosomal retrieval of AChR . Proteomic Analysis Corroborates Regulation of Endo / Lysosomal Pathway Upon Sympathectomy To gain wholistic and deeper mechanistic insight into the role of the sympathetic nervous system in regulating skeletal muscle physiology and potentially endocytic traﬃcking , proteomic analysis was performed . To study this , tibialis anterior muscles with and without chemical sympathectomy were compared . Using iTRAQ ( Ross et al . , 2004 ) technology , we could quantify 2 , 215 proteins ( ≥ 2 unique peptides and at ≤ 1 % FDR ) between PBS and 6OHD - treated mouse tibialis anterior samples . All mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identiﬁer PXD021601 . In addition , they are available as Supplementary Table 1 . The diﬀerential regulation of detected proteins is shown in the volcano plot and heatmap ( Figures 3A , B ) . While Figure 3A points to a few examples of altered proteins under the categories of metabolic , ribosomal , and sarcomeric proteins , Figure 3B demonstrates a relatively homogeneous regulation proﬁle across all tested specimens . To identify whether groups of proteins belonging to the same cellular component were regulated in a similar manner during sympathectomy , functional enrichment analysis using the “gene ontology ( GO ) cellular component complete” ( Ashburner et al . , 2000 ; Carbon et al . , 2019 ) database was used . This analysis showed ample regulation of proteins of mitochondria , actin cytoskeleton , and vesicles ( Figure 3C , upper diagram ) . Furthermore , focusing on the term “vesicle , ” the “Reactome” ( Fabregat et al . , 2018 ; Jassal et al . , 2020 ) database yielded involvement of several pathways linked to membrane traﬃcking , G - protein receptor signaling , and vesicle - mediated transport ( Figure 3C , lower diagram ) . A closer look unto individual proteins related to vesicle traﬃcking showed that Rab GTPases linked to endocytosis ( Rab 5c , Rab 7a , Table 2 and Figure 3D ) as well as regulatory proteins of Rab GTPases ( Rab3gap1 , Rabankyrin - 5 , Table 2 and Figure 3D ) and lysosomal / autophagy markers ( LAMP1 , LAMP2 , Table 2 and Figure 3D ) were upregulated upon sympathectomy . The same held true for a couple of further endocytosis - related marker proteins , including Dynamin 2 ( Table 2 and Figure 3D ) , Endophilin A2 ( Table 2 and Figure 3D ) , and Endophilin B1 ( Table 2 and Figure 3D ) .

To conﬁrm these ﬁndings , we next tested the eﬀect of sympathectomy on the abundance of several markers of the endo / lysosomal and autophagic pathways by Western blot analysis . This revealed upregulation upon sympathectomy of Rab proteins relevant for early endosomes ( Rab 5 , Figure 4A ) , late endosomes ( Rab 7a , Figure 4B ) , and recycling endosomes ( Rab 11 , Figure 4C ) . Since regulation of Rab 5 was shown to involve Cdk5 , its protein levels were also analyzed and found to be elevated upon 6OHD treatment ( Figure 4D ) . Furthermore , markers for autophagy were increased upon sympathectomy , including Rab 1b , which is important for autophagosome formation from the ER ( Figure 4E ) , Beclin1 , an essential component of autophagy initiation ( Figure 4F ) , and p62 ( aka SQSTM1 ) ( Figure 4G ) , a ubiquitin - binding protein also known to be involved in AChR turnover ( Khan et al . , 2014 ) . Finally , NCAM1 was upregulated upon sympathectomy ( Figure 4H ) . Endplate Acetylcholine Receptor - Staining Intensity Is Reduced at Neuromascular Junctions Upon Sympathectomy Given the observed increase in endo / lysosomal traﬃcking of AChR - containing vesicles ( see Figure 2 ) , we wanted to address the consequences of this increased turnover on the AChR intensity at the NMJ . For this purpose , the live imaging data in Figure 2 were inappropriate because in these experiments , the imaging and display settings were adjusted to optimize for the ratiometric analysis and involved tissue depths of a few hundred microns . Thus , we opted here for a more consistent approach for measuring AChR staining intensity , i . e . , on tissue sections . These were prepared of muscles treated with either PBS or 6OHD and then stained with BGT coupled to a ﬂuorescent dye . Fluorescence intensity was measured at the NMJ . As shown in Figures 5A , B , BGT intensity was reduced upon 6OHD treatment , and 6OHD - treated muscle sections were characterized by weakly stained NMJs ( for exemplary weakly stained NMJs , see arrowheads in Figure 5A ) . The observed increase in nuclei density ( DAPI , blue ) ﬁtted to the upregulated inﬂammatory response and muscle regeneration ( see Supplementary Figure 1 ) as well as to the observed reduction of muscle ﬁber area of approximately 35 % ( Figure 5C ) . p62 and Rab 7a Intensities Are Increased at Neuromascular Junctions Upon Sympathectomy Since proteomic and Western blot analysis lack spatial resolution , localizations of representative , upregulated proteins were analyzed on muscle slices by means of immunoﬂuorescence staining and subsequent confocal microscopy . Slices were stained with BGT for AChR , with DAPI for nuclei , and with antibodies against either Rab 7a , p62 , or Cdk5 . Under basal conditions , all three markers were slightly enriched at the NMJs but with low intensity within the muscle ﬁbers ( Figures 6 – 8 ) . In addition , Cdk5 was present along the entire sarcolemma ( Figure 8 ) . Upon sympathectomy , upregulation of Rab 7a ( Figures 6A – C ) and p62 ( Figures 7A – C ) staining at the NMJ as well as in the muscle ﬁber was observed . Conversely , Cdk5 levels remained unchanged at both these sites ( Figure 8 ) , but an increase was observed in the sarcolemma outside the NMJ area and in the interstitial space , potentially indicating the presence of immune cells ( Shupp et al . , 2017 ) or of neurodegenerative and regenerative processes ( Hwang and Namgung , 2020 ) . DISCUSSION Recent work has revealed innervation of NMJs by sympathetic neurons ( Khan et al . , 2016 ; Rodrigues et al . , 2018 , 2019 ; Straka et al . , 2018 ; Snyder - Warwick et al . , 2018 ) . This is important for morphological and functional maintenance of NMJs ( Khan et al . , 2016 ; Rodrigues et al . , 2018 , 2019 ) and has served as a plausible explanation for the beneﬁcial eﬀect of sympathicomimetics in the treatment of several forms of myasthenic syndromes ( Lee et al . , 2018 ; Finsterer , 2019 ; Thompson et al . , 2019 ) . Here , we investigated whether sympathetic innervation might act on endo / lysosomal traﬃcking at the NMJ by means of in vivo confocal microscopy , proteomic , Western blot , and immunoﬂuorescence analyses of muscles treated with or without chemical sympathectomy .

SNS and AChR Trafﬁcking to endo / lysosomal traﬃcking and autophagy . As for the ﬁrst , Western blot analysis conﬁrmed upregulation of Rab 5 and Rab 7a . With all warranted caution with respect to quantitative immunoﬂuorescence analysis , this suggested enhanced Rab 7a levels both at the NMJs and also in the cytosol . Thus , it appears that the increase upon sympathectomy of Rab 7a was not NMJ speciﬁc , but might have aﬀected the entire muscle ﬁber . For Rab 5 , immunoﬂuorescence signals were not speciﬁc enough to permit such conclusions ( data not shown ) . Previous work on in vivo imaging of Rab 5 - transfected muscles demonstrated colocalization of AChR - containing vesicles with Rab 5 ﬂuorescence and transfection of a constantly active Rab 5Q79L mutant led to a strong increase in endocytic BGT - positive endosomes ( Wild et al . , 2016 ) . With respect to autophagy markers , Western blot or proteomic analysis showed that Rab 1b , p62 , Beclin1 , and LAMP1 / 2 were enhanced upon sympathectomy . Among these markers , p62 was also studied by immunoﬂuorescence . Similar to Rab 7a , this suggested the upregulation of p62 signals both within the sarcomeric region of muscle ﬁbers as well as at NMJs . This might indicate that sympathetic neuronal signaling plays a crucial role in autophagic degradation of muscle tissue , and it is consistent with a role in the decay of AChR , as shown previously ( Khan et al . , 2014 ) . In contrast to Rab 1b , Rab 5 , Rab 7a , p62 , Beclin1 , and LAMP1 / 2 , the increase in Rab 11 and Cdk5 as observed upon proteomics and Western blot was less expected . To start with Rab 11 , this is well - known for its role in regulating vesicle recycling ( Lock and Stow , 2005 ; Takahashi et al . , 2012 ; Welz et al . , 2014 ; Redpath et al . , 2020 ) and was shown to be important also for AChR recycling ( Wild et al . , 2019 ) . Therefore , its upregulation upon sympathectomy is intriguing . An explanation for this observation might be based on the additional roles of Rab 11 in orchestrating multivesicular bodies , autophagy ( Longatti et al . , 2012 ; Fader et al . , 2008 ; Szatmári et al . , 2014 ) , and autophagosome biogenesis ( Puri et al . , 2018 ) . Furthermore , studies in a hepatocarcinoma cell line suggests requirement of cAMP for Rab 11 activity ( Won Park et al . , 2014 ) . Whether reduced cAMP signaling by sympathectomy causes accumulation of Rab 11 - positive vesicles due to reduced Rab 11 activity needs further investigation . Next , for Cdk5 , we previously showed that transfection with a dominant - negative Cdk5 blunted the typical denervation - induced increase in AChR - containing vesicles ( Wild et al . , 2016 ) . Therefore , it was speculated whether a block of Cdk5 activity correlated with increased endocytic processing of AChR . While the enhanced total level of Cdk5 upon sympathectomy observed here does not accord with this assumption , our immunoﬂuorescence analysis in 6OHD - treated cryosections revealed no speciﬁc increase in Cdk5 signal , neither in the sarcomeric regions nor at the NMJ . However , Cdk5 immunoﬂuorescence was apparently enhanced in the sarcolemma adjacent to NMJs and also in the space in between muscle ﬁbers . Given the well - known function of Cdk5 in fast adaptation of the cytoskeleton in neurons ( Shah and Rossie , 2018 ) , a general increase in Cdk5 in the sarcolemma might be a response to the described atrophy in sympathectomized muscles ( Khan et al . , 2016 ) . In addition , Cdk5 is known to be upregulated in activated immune cells ( Shupp et al . , 2017 ) and upon neurodegeneration and regeneration ( Hwang and Namgung , 2020 ) . In combination with our proteomics and DAPI staining data , which showed an increase in markers related to immune cells and in density of nuclei upon sympathectomy , the increased Cdk5 levels might have been partly due to the immune and de / regeneration processes going on after 6OHD treatment . Furthermore , the sheer presence of Cdk5 does not necessarily correlate to its activity , which additionally requires its association with a regulatory subunit , p35 ( Patrick et al . , 1999 ) . On another note , higher levels of Cdk5 were reﬂected by an upregulation upon sympathectomy of Cdc42 in proteomics . Indeed , Cdk5 indirectly activates Cdc42 via TrkB phosphorylation ( Cheung et al . , 2007 ) . Cdc42 is a small GTPase of the Rho family that mediates agrin - induced AChR clustering together with Rac1 ( Weston et al . , 2000 ) and might serve as a regulator in clathrin - independent endocytosis together with endophilins ( Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ; Howes et al . , 2010 ; Sandvig et al . , 2018 ; Redpath et al . , 2020 ) . Rac1 ( not regulated , Supplementary Table 1 ) , another small GTPase of the Rac family , is , besides its role in AChR clustering ( Weston et al . , 2000 ) , known to be inhibited by RCC2 ( upregulated , Supplementary Table 1 ; Tilley et al . , 2015 ) and to interact with coronin 1C ( upregulated , Supplementary Table 1 ) . Generally , coronins are actin - associated proteins involved in remodeling of the cytoskeleton ( De Hostos et al . , 1991 ; De Hostos , 1999 ; Tilley et al . , 2015 ) . So far , three types of coronins , all altered here in abundance upon sympathectomy ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , have been classiﬁed based on sequence homology : type I includes coronins 1 A – C as well as coronin 6 , type II is represented by coronins 2A and B , and ﬁnally , coronin 7 belongs to type III ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . Association of coronins with the actin - related protein 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex ( Arpc2 , Arpc3 , both upregulated , Supplementary Table 1 ) was suggested based on experiments in yeast ( Humphries et al . , 2002 ) . Further analysis showed regulation of coronin 1B ( upregulated , Supplementary Table 1 ) and the Arp2 / 3 complex via protein kinase C ( Cai et al . , 2005 ) . Coronin 6 ( downregulated , Supplementary Table 1 ) and coronin 1C are the main isoforms expressed in healthy skeletal muscle , and destabilization of AChR was found in vivo upon reduction of coronin 6 ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . Potentially , this was due to disturbances in interaction of AChR and actin ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . Whether the sympathectomy - induced regulation of markers acting on the actin cytoskeleton observed in the proteomics analysis is speciﬁc to NMJs has still to be determined . Since cytoskeletal rearrangements are also needed for vesicle traﬃcking , the observation of increased endo / lysosomal traﬃcking , which also aﬀects AChR turnover , might be correlated with this . Changes in AChR turnover are a hallmark of aging ( Gonzalez - Freire et al . , 2014 ; Rudolf et al . , 2014 ; Taetzsch and Valdez , 2018 ) . Interestingly , enhanced presence of TH staining at the NMJs of a mouse model with brain - speciﬁc overexpression of Sirt1 ( Satoh et al . , 2013 ) correlated with slowed aging and “healthier - looking” NMJs compared with age - matched wild types ( Snyder - Warwick et al . , 2018 ) . Along these lines , a Troponin T ( cardiac ) - promoted switch between PKA regulatory subunit type I α ( RI α ) and PKA - RII α / RII β at the NMJ was previously reported upon aging ( Xu et al . , 2017 ) . In the present study , we found an increase Frontiers in Physiology | www . frontiersin . org 14 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 626707 fphys - 12 - 626707 March 7 , 2021 Time : 16 : 50 # 15 Straka et al . SNS and AChR Trafﬁcking in AChR turnover upon sympathectomy that was accompanied by enhanced PKA - RI α levels together with a reduction in PKA - RII α , similar to that described by Rodrigues et al . ( 2018 ) . This suggests that lowered sympathetic input might induce a switch of PKA regulatory subunits . Although only PKA - RI α , but not PKA RII α / RII β , was found to be associated with AChRs ( Röder et al . , 2010 ) , this might change in old age or upon sympathectomy . In addition to the eﬀects of sympathectomy on skeletal muscle , recent work ( Rodrigues et al . , 2018 ) using surgical sympathectomy described also motoneuronal neuroﬁlament dephosphorylation and a reduced presynaptic synaptophysin staining ( Rodrigues et al . , 2018 ) . That study used microsurgical bilateral excision of the second and third lumbar ( L2 - L3 ) ganglia of the paravertebral sympathetic chain and sample harvest 7 days later ( Rodrigues et al . , 2018 ) . This procedure yielded an upregulation of transcripts related to denervation such as chrng and myogenin ( Rodrigues et al . , 2018 ) , but no increase in NCAM mRNA , although this is considered as a solid sign for denervation ( Covault and Sanes , 1985 ; Rodrigues et al . , 2018 ) . Conversely , we found upregulation of NCAM protein levels , both , in the proteomics and the Western blot analyses . This discrepancy might be explained by a ﬁnding of Lang et al . , where a denervation - mediated rise of NCAM protein levels was not due to increased NCAM protein synthesis but rather enhanced NCAM protein stability ( Lang et al . , 2017 ) . To sum up , the present data are consistent with a previously suggested model where sympathetic neurons not only innervate blood vessels but also motoneurons , muscle ﬁbers , and NMJs ( Khan et al . , 2016 ) . It appears that sympathectomy has a major impact on metabolism and protein traﬃcking . In particular , while mitochondrial markers were massively turned down , endo / lysosomal , and autophagic pathways were enhanced .
