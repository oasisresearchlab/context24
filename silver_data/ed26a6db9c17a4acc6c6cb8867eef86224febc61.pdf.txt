Claudins ( CLDNs ) , occludin ( OCLN ) , and junctional adhesion molecules ( JAMs ) are CAMs’ components of the tight junction ( TJ ) , the single protein structure tasked with safeguarding the paracellular space . The TJ is responsible for controlling paracellular permeability according to size and charge . Currently , there are no therapeutic solutions to modulate the TJ . Here , we describe the expression of CLDN proteins in the outer membrane of E . coli and report its consequences . When the expression is induced , the unicellular behavior of E . coli is replaced with multicellular aggregations that can be quantiﬁed using Flow Cytometry ( FC ) . Our method , called iCLASP ( inspection of cell - adhesion molecules aggregation through FC protocols ) , allows high - throughput screening ( HTS ) of small - molecules for interactions with CAMs . Here , we focused on using iCLASP to identify paracellular modulators for CLDN2 . Furthermore , we validated those compounds in the mammalian cell line A549 as a proof - of - concept for the iCLASP method . Keywords : cell - adhesion molecules ; paracellular permeability ; tight junctions 1 . Introduction The cytoskeleton is a structure that helps cells acquire and maintain their shape and internal organization , providing additional mechanical support that enables cells to carry out essential functions such as division and movement [ 1 ] . The cytoskeleton is a multi - component structure working in unison to achieve homeostasis [ 2 ] . Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes rely on their cytoskeleton for cell morphogenesis , cell division , DNA partitioning , and cell motility [ 1 , 3 ] . Many bacteria found in nature show morphological polarity [ 4 ] . As an example , a rod - shaped bacterium such as Escherichia coli ( E . coli ) requires an actin - like polymer formed from MreB to be assembled in order to deﬁne its shape [ 5 ] . Recently , the discovery that eukaryotic cytoskeletal proteins have homologues in bacteria that affect the cell shape has been a great step forward in understanding cell polarity [ 3 ] . In the absence of extracellular contacts , single epithelial cells exhibit very few of the structural characteristics of polarized cells [ 6 , 7 ] . Extracellular contacts between single cells are sufﬁcient to initiate the segregation of membrane and cytoskeletal proteins [ 8 ] . Interactions between endothelial or epithelial cells are speciﬁed by cell adhesion proteins and result in the formation of paracellular barriers that isolate tissues and organs , creating homeostatic environments [ 9 , 10 ] . Cell adhesion molecules ( CAMs ) are cell surface proteins involved in establishing cell – cell , cell – extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , or cell – pathogens interactions in a process called cell adhesion [ 11 , 12 ] . In the classical sense , CAMs are grouped into four major families : Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2023 , 24 , 9784 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / ijms24129784 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / ijms Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2023 , 24 , 9784 2 of 18 selectins , the immunoglobulin superfamily ( IgSF ) , integrins , and cadherins [ 13 , 14 ] . Their adhesion properties are relevant in physiological and pathophysiological events [ 15 ] . Ep - ithelial and endothelial cell – cell contacts are needed for homeostasis ; intercellular junctional complexes are key for their maintenance [ 10 ] . Cadherins in the adherens junctions ( AJs ) provide essential adhesive and mechanical properties [ 16 ] . Recently , novel integral mem - brane proteins , claudins ( CLDNs ) and occludin ( OCLN ) , have been identiﬁed as major membranal components of the tight junction ( TJ ) [ 17 ] . The TJs occupy the most apical region of the cell and create an almost impenetrable barrier that forms without interruption through the entire perimeter of the cell [ 18 – 20 ] . AJs and TJs play essential roles in vascular integrity but only the TJ controls the paracellular permeability [ 21 ] . CLDNs comprise a multigene family of 4 - α - helix transmembrane domains , each member approximately 23 kDa [ 19 , 22 ] . OCLN is a unique protein of the TJ with a structural homology to CLDNs’ 4 - α - helix transmembrane domains but it differs in the extracellular loops’ composition and the length and function of its intracellular domains [ 18 , 22 ] . Junctional adhesion molecules ( JAMs ) , another membrane component of the TJ , are members of the IgSF [ 23 ] . These non - classical CAMs’ involvement in developmental and physiological processes [ 24 , 25 ] , or pathophysiological events such as tumorigenesis and metastasis [ 26 , 27 ] , enhances their relevance in translational solutions [ 28 ] . The blood – brain barrier ( BBB ) , for example , is a cellular obstacle that maintains the homeostasis of the neural microenvironment [ 29 ] . The TJs between brain capillary endothelial cells greatly limit molecular trafﬁc across the paracellular route , with the exception of small molecules ( < 400 Da ) and gaseous molecules [ 30 ] . These paracellular and transcellular barrier properties of the BBB , therefore , result in challenges for drug delivery to the central nervous system ( CNS ) , though it has been found that TJs’ dysfunction in the BBB is responsible for increased permeability [ 31 ] , with CLDN5 being the most relevant CAM in the BBB . CLDN5 knockout experiments in mice result in increased permeability [ 32 ] . The double knockdown of CLDN5 and OCLN facilitates enhanced permeation of tracer molecules between 3 and 10 kDa [ 33 ] . Other CLDNs are ion permeable [ 19 ] . CLDN2 is a paracellular channel - forming protein that is highly expressed in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes , where it regulates para - cellular cation and water ﬂow required for the proper regulation of bile composition [ 34 ] . Dysregulation of this process increases susceptibility to cholesterol gallstone disease in mice [ 35 ] . CLDN10 constitutes paracellular anion channels , and different pathogenic vari - ants of the CLDN10 gene demonstrate dysfunction of the kidney , exocrine glands , and skin [ 36 ] . With all the CAMs working together , the TJs create a regulated paracellular barrier that controls the passage of water , solutes , and cells [ 37 , 38 ] . Thus , controlling the TJ could result in an effective strategy for the manipulation of the paracellular permeability [ 32 ] . This has been done in a few cases , where modulation of the TJ to prevent viral infections or increase the BBB permeability have been achieved in vitro by peptides corresponding to the extracellular loops of CLDNs [ 39 – 41 ] . To the best of our knowledge , Focused Ultrasound and Micro bubbling is the closest technique to FDA approval for drug delivery through the paracellular route [ 42 ] . Nevertheless , the current clinical trials are primarily related to Parkinson’s disease [ 43 ] . Using a synthetic biology approach , we engineered E . coli to recombinantly express CLDN and OCLN in its outer membrane . Overexpression of these proteins causes the unicellular E . coli to aggregate due to the adhesion properties of these proteins . Such aggregates can be identiﬁed using Flow Cytometry ( FC ) and the extent of aggregation correlates to the cell – cell adhesion power of individual CAMs . Our method , named iCLASP ( inspection of cell - adhesion molecules aggregation through FC protocols ) is a high throughput solution to identify paracellular modiﬁers to potentiate drug delivery of hydrophilic molecules .

Conceptual Model TJs are intercellular junctions critical for building the tissue barrier and maintaining cellular polarity [ 44 , 45 ] . Recent ﬁndings have uncovered CLDN - independent aspects of the TJ’s structure and function , highlighting additional players including JAMs , membrane lipids , mechanical force , and phase separation of the zonula occludens ( ZO ) family of adaptor proteins ( AP ) , which have all been shown to play important roles in the TJ’s structure and function [ 46 ] . TJs have three distinct functions : ( 1 ) Barrier : form a permeability barrier that re - stricts free diffusion of molecules across the intercellular space ; ( 2 ) Fence : act as a mem - brane fence that restricts intermixing of apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains ; ( 3 ) Signaling : form bidirectional signaling platforms that receive signals from the cell inte - rior which regulate the TJs’ assembly and function , and also transduce signals to the cell interior to control cell proliferation , migration , differentiation , and survival [ 38 , 45 , 46 ] . The ﬁrst two functions , Barrier and Fence , are achieved through protein – protein interactions ( PPIs ) . The Fence function requires the interaction of cytoskeleton - adapter proteins ( ZO ) - CLDN ( or OCLN or JAM ) . A recent article suggested that Barrier and Fence functions are independent of each other , indicating that in vivo ZO - 1 is dispensable for the Barrier function [ 47 ] . The Barrier function can be impacted by the use of CLDN extracellular loop - peptides or other protein engineering strategies employing CLDNs [ 39 , 48 , 49 ] . We thus conclude that disrupting PPIs of CLDNs equates to disrupting cell – cell adhesion . As with all noncovalent macromolecular interactions , adhesion molecules bind to each other with equilibrium afﬁnities that are deﬁned by their association and dissociation rates [ 50 , 51 ] . However , the efﬁciency of cell adhesion is not simply a function of the solution - phase equilibrium afﬁnities of adhesion molecules for one another . Adhesion molecules in the plasma membrane and ECM are limited to two dimensions . Thus , even low - afﬁnity molecular interactions may stabilize adhesion if there is time for sufﬁcient bonds to form along the plane of cell contact . The efﬁciency of cell adhesion and the resulting strength of adhesion reﬂect multiple factors that dictate the probability of formation of bonds between adhesion molecules on cell or matrix surfaces [ 52 , 53 ] . Cell adhesion can be further stabilized by events that occur after the initial interactions of CAMs , as salting - in or - out can have a strong impact on cell adhesion as highlighted by the studies of the Hofmeister series [ 54 , 55 ] . Furthermore , cadherins are CAMs that have been found to be calcium - dependent [ 56 , 57 ] . In this report , we designed a strategy that will examine PPIs of the TJ membrane component CLDN and OCLN . As mentioned above , these proteins alone can exhibit cell - adhesion properties in the absence of adapter proteins and mammalian cytoskeleton proteins [ 47 ] , and manipulating these PPIs corresponds to effects in the permeability of the paracellular barriers [ 39 , 49 ] . Thus , in this current work , we do not seek to explain or analyze all complexities of the TJ ( Figure 1 ) . Our system has isolated each membrane protein from a complex environment and equated PPIs as a force that will drive non - native cell – cell interactions in E . coli . Int . J . Mol .

Fol - lowing our design to fuse CLDN ( blue box ) and OmpW ( white cylinder ) , E . coli cells overexpressing these fused proteins will form non - polarizing pseudo junctions shu tt led to the outer membrane ( OM ) . There are no intracellular ( periplasmic ) PPIs for the fusion protein . The insert demonstrates how , hypothetically , these cells will create large , disordered aggregates of cells without other con - sequences for cell biology . 2 . 2 . Expression System Design The initial goal of our strategy was to recombinantly express CLDNs or OCLN in the outer membrane ( OM ) of E . coli to examine the consequences of endowing a unicellular organism with cell - adhesion molecules . In the strict sense , only outer membrane proteins ( Omp ) are expressed in the OM of E . coli [ 59 ] . For pathogenic strains , many of these Omp also serve as virulence factors for nutrient scavenging and the evasion of host defense mechanisms [ 60 ] . Omps are unique membrane proteins in that they have a β - barrel fold and can range in size from 8 to 26 strands , with both N - and C - terminus located in the periplasmic space [ 59 , 60 ] . Our strategy created a fusion protein between OmpW ( accession number P0A915 ) and a human CLDN protein . The N - and C - terminus of OmpW are located in the periplasm ; thus , a fusion between OmpW and CLDN , also with N - and C - terminal ends under the plasma membrane will result in an exposure of the adhesive domains ( extracel - lular loops ) of CLDNs to the exterior of the cell ( Figure 2A ) .

Acces - sion numbers for each protein used in this study can be found in Figure S5 . Our results highlight the notion that CLDN5 , the main CLDN of the BBB , is the strongest cell – cell CAM among the members of this family [ 31 , 68 ] . CLDN5 – CLDN5 PPIs have not been measured experimentally . Nevertheless , the Experimental Slope of OmpW CLDN5 was the largest . Additionally , we observed an Experimental Slope above the con - trols for OmpW - STRGZ , indicating that it has the potential to act as a CAM in the brain [ 67 ] . Considering our results reported here for a chimeric DsbB - CLDN5 ( Figure 4 ) and STRGZ , we propose that iCLASP is a favorable method to discover cell - adhesion proper - ties in novel or suspected CAMs . To determine the extent to which iCLASP can be used to determine changes in TJ - induced paracellular permeability , we resourced to study a dose response of molecules known to non - speci ﬁ cally alter trans - epithelial electrical resistance ( TEER ) [ 69 ] . TEER is a widely accepted quantitative technique to measure the integrity of TJs’ dynamics in in vitro models of endothelial and epithelial monolayers ; it is considered as a strong indica - tor of the paracellular permeability prior to the evaluation for transport of drugs or chem - icals [ 69 , 70 ] . Sodium Caprate is a known detergent that disrupts CLDN – CLDN interac - tions resulting in an increased permeability of the paracellular space [ 71 , 72 ] . On the other hand , Ethanol has been described as an agent that increases CLDN – CLDN interactions , resulting in decreased paracellular permeability [ 73 ] . Figure 6 exhibits dose - dependent changes to cell – cell interactions under the e ﬀ ects of Caprate or Ethanol . Thus , considering how iCLASP can identify changes in CLDN – CLDN interactions , mirroring the results of both Caprate and Ethanol in TEER experi - ments , we suggest it can be used for the discovery of molecules that a ﬀ ect paracellular permeability controlled by CLDN proteins and perhaps other CAMs .

All points are statistically signi ﬁ cant and signi ﬁ cantly di ﬀ erent from each other ( p < 0 . 01 ) . Asterisks are omi tt ed for display purposes . For CLDN2 , the Hofmeister series for cations has a trend of increasing cell – cell adhe - sion ( Figure 7 ) . Al + 3 has a more relaxing e ﬀ ect on CLDN2 – CLDN2 interactions , while Rb + aids increase CLDN2 – CLDN2 PPIs . The Hofmeister series ranks the salts by degree of stabilization or destabilization . In the case of CLDN2 , losing stability further drives CLDN2 – CLDN2 interactions , which would be detrimental to the cation permeability function , thus tightening the TJ but reducing the ability to sort cations or excluding them from needed ﬁ ltering . In the kidney , CLDN2 is vital for e ﬃ cient Na + and water reabsorp - tion in the proximal tubules . Accordingly , the S2 segment of the proximal tubules in clau - din - 2 KO mice showed signi ﬁ cantly reduced net transepithelial reabsorption of Na + , Cl − , and water [ 80 ] . CLDN10 , on the other hand , has a trend that seems to indicate that , at lower stability , the permeability of the TJ will increase . Mice with a deletion of CLDN10 in the thick ascending limb impairs paracellular Na + permeability and leads to hy - permagnesemia and nephrocalcinosis [ 81 ] . The data provided by KO experiments of CLDN2 and CLDN10 represents the complete absence of these crucial proteins for kidney function . Our experimentation of these protein’s function in ﬂ uenced by salts in the Hof - meister series reveals further information regarding the e ﬀ ects on the TJ’s microenviron - ment and its e ﬀ ect on the TJ’s barrier function . Taken together , when salts decrease the stability of the microenvironment , CLDN2 loses its function but tightens the TJ ( hypoper - meability ) , corresponding to the CLDN2 KO results in which reduced net transepithelial reabsorption of Na + , Cl − , and water is observed [ 80 ] . On the other hand , our data suggests that when CLDN10 loses its function , the TJ’s organization may lead to hyperpermeabil - ity , supported by the data suggesting that KO CLDN10 leads to hypermagnesemia and nephrocalcinosis , characterized by the deposition of calcium in the kidney parenchyma and tubules [ 81 ] .

Bacterial cells are transformed with plasmids hosting 4 - α - helix CAM membrane proteins . CAMs induce multicellular behavior in E . coli ( aggregates or clumps of cells ) that can be measured by Flow Cytometry protocols .

The power displayed by iCLASP is two - fold ; the screen of a library of compounds may identify , in the same experiment , compounds that decrease or increase the size of aggregates . The ﬁrst will represent cases in which the compound induces hyperpermeability of the paracellular space , while the second represents a hypopermeability outcome . Hyperpermeability may be desirable when trying to overcome , as an example , the BBB for drug delivery . In other cases , TJ dysfunction may contribute to epithelial permeation disorder as is the case of multiple intestinal diseases such as inﬂammatory bowel diseases ( IBD ) [ 82 ] . In such cases , hypop - ermeability may be required to foster cell – cell interactions to prevent progression of the disease , inﬂammation , and recurrent infections [ 83 , 84 ] . In any event , these compounds can also shed light on the function of particular CAMs , their function , and their role in physiology and pathophysiology . Int . J . Mol .

From this smaller screen , we identiﬁed three compounds in each category . Typical results for single compounds that decreased the Experimental Slope were in the range of 20 – 35 % , while the values of compounds that increased the Experimental Slope of cells expressing OmpW - CLDN2 were between 8 – 15 % . 2 . 6 . Paracellular Modulators of CLDN2 in Mammalian Cells A549 CLDN2 has been linked to cell proliferation in vitro in A549 cells . The downreg - ulation of CLDN2 expression decreased proliferation in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells [ 85 ] . Additionally , CLDN2 binding peptides downregulate its expression and results in anticancer resistance in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells [ 49 ] . Concluding , using iCLASP , we identiﬁed six compounds that later were used in tissue culture experiments to measure cell proliferation in A549 cells in order to validate our ﬁnd - ings . Compounds that decreased the Experimental Slope of E . coli hosting OmpW - CLDN2 , in other words decreasing PPIs , resulted in lower proliferation rates . Compounds that in iCLASP increased Experimental Slopes resulted in the increased proliferation of A549 cells . Combining our results with the previously mentioned literature , the six compounds identi - ﬁed by iCLASP may have an effect in lung cancer biology . A recent report discusses the multifaceted aspects of CLDN2 in cancer . CLDN2 promotes breast cancer liver metastasis by promoting cancer cell survival [ 86 ] . The article also discusses that CLDN2 is functionally required for colorectal cancer liver metastasis and that CLDN2 expression in primary col - orectal cancers is associated with poor overall and liver metastasis - free survival [ 86 ] . The proliferation of human adenocarcinoma A549 cells was decreased by CLDN2 knockdown together with a decrease in the percentage of S phase cells [ 87 ] . Gallotannin ( Gltn ) has been previously demonstrated to have potent anti - tumor properties against cholangiocar - cinoma in mice and recently in vitro against triple - negative breast cancer with its effects associated with slowed cell cycle progression and S phase arrest [ 88 ] . A recent review [ 89 ] examined advances in Gltn anticancer activities and drug delivery systems for efﬁciency improvement . Recently , a human clinical pilot trial investigated the pharmacokinetics of Gltn - metabolites [ 90 ] . As depicted for Gltn , validating hit compounds identiﬁed by iCLASP in mammalian cells opens the door for future screening in search of molecules that can modify CAM’s properties and aid in physiological or pathophysiological situations . The compounds tested in Figure 9 ( see also Figure S6 ) will be used to identify First - In - Family and First - In - Class CLDN2 modulators . The drug discovery of small molecules from the target selection through to the clinical evaluation is a very complex and challenging area of study . The main obstacle in drug discovery is the initial hit - ﬁnding [ 91 , 92 ] . The absence of tools to overcome the BBB leads directly to the present situation in neurotherapeutics , where few effective treatments exist for most brain - related disorders [ 93 – 95 ] . Intentional drug discovery or drug design is hampered by the lack of knowledge in the fundamental transport properties of the BBB and the molecular and cellular biology of the brain capillary endothelium dictated in great part by the TJ . Currently , dynamics of the BBB and cytotoxicity testing and drug permeation are carried out in vitro using TEER [ 96 ] . Some challenges encountered in TEER are the lengthy set - up , up to three weeks prior to obtaining adequate conditions for measurements , and the availability of suitable cell lines that represent the desired system of study [ 69 ] . Finally , identiﬁed cellular systems may fail to produce adequate and measurable TEER values [ 69 , 96 ] . Prodrug methods used to improve drug penetration via the transcellular Int . J . Mol .

Other methods , including ( a ) blocking the efﬂux pumps to improve transcellular delivery and ( b ) the modulation of cell – cell adhesion in the intercellular junctions to improve paracellular delivery across biological barriers , are still in the investigational stage [ 98 ] .

Compounds identiﬁed using iCLASP were tested in a proliferation assay using A549 lung cancer cells . No compound added to A549 cells is labeled as NONE , and proliferation under these conditions was used as 100 % . All other values are pre - sented as a fold of NONE . Compounds G01 , G04 , and H03 increased proliferation , while A04 , A10 , and C02 decreased it . Commercial identiﬁers can be found in Figure S6 . Data was collected and analyzed from four different experiments and presented as values ± STDEV . All values are different than the control ( NONE ) with p < 0 . 05 .

All genes employed in this study were synthesized by TWIST biosciences ( San Francisco , CA , USA ) and cloned in pET28a . All salts used for the experimental performance of Figure 5 were obtained from Sigma Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO , USA ) . TEV protease was obtained from New England Biolabs ( Ipswich , MA , USA ) . Accession numbers of all full - length genes used in this study can be found in Figure S5 . 3 . 2 . Transformation , Cell Growth , and Protein Expression ( LB , Fresh Transformations , Controls ) Plasmids ( pET28a , pET28a - OmpW - CLDN , pET28a - cpOmpW - JAM - A ) are transformed in BL21 DE3 cells ; plates are prepared with LB , 2 % agar , and 100 µ g / mL of kanamycin . A single colony is grown over night in 5 mL of LB and kanamycin . A 1 : 1000 dilution of the overnight culture is started in the morning . Cells are grown at 30 C until OD 600 is 1 . 0 .

Sci . 2023 , 24 , 9784 13 of 18 at 21 ◦ C ( room temperature ) and allowed to continue growth for 18 h . Samples can be analyzed by Western blot and anti - HIS antibody ( ab1187 ) Abcam ( Cambridge , UK ) . 3 . 3 . Flow Cytometry Data Collection and Analysis Samples were prepared in suspension by mixing 50 µ L of cultured cells with 150 µ L of PBS and then run through a Beckman Coulter Cytoﬂex ﬂow cytometer ( Beckman Coulter , Indianapolis , IN , USA ) . Readings were collected using the side scatter ( SSC ) data from the 405 nm ( violet ) laser for excitation and a 405 / 10 bandpass ﬁlter for emission detection . The violet laser SSC has a greater sensitivity than the forward scatter ( FSC ) or SSC detection of the 488 nm ( blue ) laser for detecting alterations in cell shape as reported by others [ 61 ] and according to our assessment of ﬂow data results in this study . SSC area versus height readings were plotted for the data analysis . Cytoﬂex - generated FCS ﬂow data ﬁles were analyzed using FlowJo 10 software ( BD Biosciences , Ashland , OR , USA ) . The violet SSC - area by SSC - height data was gated for the data analysis and set to exclude upper and lower extremes that would interfere with the calculation of the slope of the line .

Cell Proliferation Assay The ﬁrst day of the proliferation assay , A549 cells ( ATCC CCL - 185 ) consisted of 100 , 000 cells seeded on 48 - well plates . On the second day ( at approximately 16 h ) , cells were treated with PBS or compounds to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 µ M . After 24 h , prolifer - ation assays were performed using the ATPlite Luminescence Assay System ( PerkinElmer , American Fork , UT , USA ) , following the manufacturer’s instructions . 3 . 5 . Statistical Analysis Flow Cytometry data ( Experimental Slope ) were analyzed using SAS software version 9 ( SAS Institute Inc . , Cary , NC , USA ) and the Mixed Procedure method to generate p - values , standard deviation , and standard error and to determine statistical signiﬁcance ( for Figure 5 ) . For all experiments , α = 0 . 05 . Data was collected for each sample in four different experiments ( n = 4 ) . Each condition was measured in 12 - replicates . Thus , for each , data points correspond to the average of 12 - replicates and n = 4 , or 48 data points . Statistical differences were identiﬁed for all samples in each graph . The ﬁnal analysis concluded that all treatments are statistically signiﬁcant ( p < 0 . 01 ) and signiﬁcantly different from each other and the control ( asterisks omitted for display purposes ) . 3 . 6 . ChemBridge DIVERSet Library The initial HTS of BL21 DE3 cells expressing OmpW CLDN2 was performed us - ing the ChemBridge DIVERSet library ( San Diego , CA , USA ) . The library consisted of 50 , 000 compounds . The hits identiﬁed according to our laboratory nomenclature ( Figure 8 ) are presented by the ChemBridge seven - digit identiﬁer in Figure S6 . The chemical structure of the compounds is also shown in Figure S6 . More detailed protocols of the drug discovery process using the ChemBridge DIVERSet library are detailed in Figure S7 . 4 . Conclusions Currently , there are no therapeutic solutions to control the permeability of the para - cellular space in the clinical setting . CAMs , like the TJ’s integral membrane proteins , are responsible for paracellular permeability . In this article , we present evidence for a high throughput E . coli - based method that recombinantly expresses CAMs . This expression results in bacterial cell aggregates that can be quantiﬁed and qualiﬁed using Flow Cy - tometry . The method , named iCLASP , can examine small molecule libraries and identify candidates that increase or decrease permeability . Compared to classical methods , iCLASP is faster , needing only three days to set up ( from transformation to experiment ) , and Flow Cytometry is performed at speeds of one 96 - well / h in our laboratory . When iCLASP was used to identify CLDN2 paracellular modulators , it was able to identify six compounds in which effects in bacteria expressing CLDN2 translated to literature reports of effects of CLDN2 on A549 cell proliferation . CAMs are responsible for cell – cell , cell – extracellular matrix , and cell – pathogen interactions . The iCLASP method is a HTS method to examine CAMs and aid in the initial hit - ﬁnding down the drug discovery pipeline .
