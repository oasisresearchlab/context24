Here , we describe a mechanism of action for trastuzumab whereby antibody treatment disrupts ligand - independent HER2 / HER3 interactions in HER2 - ampliﬁed cells . The kinetics of dissociation parallels HER3 dephosphorylation and uncoupling from PI3K activity , leading to downregulation of proximal and distal AKT signaling , and correlates with the antiproliferative effects of tras - tuzumab . A selective and potent PI3K inhibitor , GDC - 0941 , is highly efﬁcacious both in combination with tras - tuzumab and in the treatment of trastuzumab - resistant cells and tumors . INTRODUCTION Herceptin ( trastuzumab ) was initially approved for the treatment of women with metastatic breast cancer overexpressing HER2 / ErbB2 . The randomized clinical trial that led to this approval was conducted in combination with standard cytotoxic chemo - therapy ( Slamon et al . , 2001 ) . In addition , two single - agent , single - arm studies were also conducted in metastatic breast cancer patients , and these studies demonstrated that trastuzu - mab alone had a ﬁnite and measurable response rate ( Cobleigh et al . , 1999 ; Vogel et al . , 2002 ) . Long - term therapeutic beneﬁt is also recognized in the adjuvant setting . For early - stage , HER2 - positive breast cancer patients , trastuzumab therapy after chemotherapy offers signiﬁcant beneﬁt ( Smith et al . , 2007 ) . Trastuzumab is thought to manifest its mechanism of action in multiple ways . As a humanized IgG 1 , it binds to Fc g receptor III ( RIII ) and is a potent mediator of antibody - dependent , cell - medi - ated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) . Evidence for the importance of Fc - Fc g RIII involvement in the mechanism of action of trastuzu - mab is provided by Clynes et al . ( 2000 ) , who assessed trastuzu - mab response in tumor models deﬁcient in Fc g RIII function . In addition to engaging immune effector cells , numerous investiga - tions suggest that trastuzumab also inhibits tumor cell signaling or shows partial agonist activities ( Sarup et al . , 1991 ) . The biochemical nature of these properties is confusing and contro - versial . Initially , it was thought that engagement of HER2 by tras - tuzumab led to an increase in HER2 endocytosis or degradation rate ( Hudziak et al . , 1989 ) . Careful analysis of HER2 endocytosis led to the conclusion that the monoclonal antibodies do not affect HER2 internalization or endocytic rates ( Austin et al . , 2004 ; Hommelgaard et al . , 2004 ) . Additionally , trastuzumab is not effective in blocking dimerization of HER2 with ligand - acti - vated EGFR or HER3 ( Agus et al . , 2002 ) . Nevertheless , trastuzu - mab treatment does result in G 1 - S cell cycle growth arrest that does not lead to apoptosis ( Lewis et al . , 1996 ) . Several reports suggest that the cytostatic effect of trastuzumab correlates with a downregulation of AKT activity , which ultimately leads to an increase in the CDK2 inhibitor p27 ( Lane et al . , 2000 ; Lee et al . , 2001 ; Yakes et al . , 2002 ) . Furthermore , trastuzumab is reported to have either no effect on HER2 activation status or to cause a rapid increase or decrease of HER2 phosphorylation ( Lane et al . , 2000 ; Nagata et al . , 2004 ; Sarup et al . , 1991 ) . A number of studies suggest that the transformation potential of HER2 is augmented by coexpression with HER3 ( Cohen et al . , 1996 ; Zhang et al . , 1996 ) . Interfering with or ablating HER3 expression or interaction with HER2 resulted in antiproliferative SIGNIFICANCE This study characterizes a mechanism of action for trastuzumab whereby trastuzumab disrupts the constitutively signaling ligand - independent HER2 / HER3 / PI3K complex . The ﬁndings presented suggest that a combination of trastuzumab and the PI3K inhibitor GDC - 0941 warrants clinical evaluation in patients who have not been treated with a HER2 - directed therapy in the metastatic setting . Moreover , patients who progress on trastuzumab or lapatinib ( a HER2 - directed tyrosine kinase inhib - itor ) may derive beneﬁt from additional therapy that includes the PI3K inhibitor GDC - 0941 .

We recently conﬁrmed and extended upon these observations by using a combination of RNA silencing of HER receptor expression , a tumor model with induc - ible HER3 knockdown , and the analysis of HER3 activation status in HER2 - positive breast cancer specimens ( Lee - Hoeﬂich et al . , 2008 ) . Based on these ﬁndings , we conclude that consti - tutively active HER2 is dependent on HER3 for mediating its effects , and that EGFR plays little or no role in driving the biology of HER2 - positive breast cancer . Previously , we reported that pertuzumab binding to the extra - cellular domain II of HER2 ( Franklin et al . , 2004 ) efﬁciently blocks ligand - induced HER2 / HER3 dimerization ( Agus et al . , 2002 ) . In contrast , trastuzumab binds to subdomain IV of HER2 , which results in the downregulation of PI3K / AKT signaling in tumor cells that overexpress HER2 in the absence of ligands . An objective of the present study was to examine the molecular basis for trastuzumab’s effect on ligand - independent HER2 / HER3 / PI3K signaling . In addition , we investigated GDC - 0941 , a potent and selective PI3K inhibitor ( Folkes et al . , 2008 ) in model systems that were sensitive and resistant to trastuzumab . RESULTS Trastuzumab Treatment of Tumors Inhibits the HER3 / PI3K / AKT Pathway In Vivo To examine whether trastuzumab treatment results in dephos - phorylation of HER3 and AKT in vivo , we treated mice harboring established BT474 - M1 tumors with 20 mg / kg trastuzumab for 48 hr . Tumor lysates were subjected to western blot ( pHER3 ) and ELISA ( pAKT ) analysis . Treatment with trastuzumab ( Figure 1A ) signiﬁcantly reduced the level of pHER3 ( Tyr1289 ) in the tumors ( p = 0 . 0003 , Dunnett’s test ) . Similarly , pAKT ( Ser473 ) was signiﬁcantly reduced in trastuzumab - treated tumors ( p = 0 . 0072 ) . Together , these data demonstrate that tras - tuzumab treatment leads to inhibition of the HER3 / PI3K / AKT pathway in vivo . Kinetics of HER3 / PI3K / AKT Pathway Inhibition by Trastuzumab Although trastuzumab treatment is reported to decrease pHER3 , pAKT , andPI3KactivityinHER2 - ampliﬁedcells ( Laneetal . , 2000 ; Yakes et al . , 2002 ) , the kinetics and contribution of this inhibition Figure 1 . Trastuzumab - Induced Inhibition of Proliferation Correlates with Inhibition of the HER3 / PI3K / AKT Pathway ( A ) Pre - established BT474 - M1 tumor xenografts were treated with 20 mg / kg trastuzumab or control antibody . Tumors were harvested after 48 hr , homogenized , and analyzed for pHER3 ( Tyr1289 ) and total HER3 by western blot . pAKT ( Ser473 ) and total AKT were analyzed by using ELISA . The statistical signiﬁcance was determined by using Dunnett’s test . ( B ) SKBR - 3 cells were treated with 10 m g / ml trastuzumab for indicated times . pHER3 ( Tyr1289 ) , pAKT ( Ser473 ) , and pPRAS40 ( Thr246 ) wereanalyzed by using western blot or ELISA ( pAKT ) . See Figure S1A for original western blots . ( C ) SKBR - 3 cells were treated with 10 m g / ml trastuzumab for indicated times or with heregulin ( HRG ) for 15 min . The p85subunit ofPI3KwasdetectedfromHER3immunopre - cipitates by western blot . pHER3 ( Tyr1289 ) was blotted directly from the lysates . ( D ) SKBR - 3 and BT474 - M1 cells were treated with 10 m g / ml trastuzumab for 96 hr . pHER3 was analyzed by HER3 immunoprecipitation , followed by detection with HRP - conjugated p - Tyr antibody . pAKT ( Ser473 ) was analyzed by using ELISA . ( E ) HER2 - overexpressing cancer cells and MCF - 7 cells were treated with or without 10 m g / ml trastuzumab for 2 hr , lysed , and subjected to pAKT ELISA ( Ser473 ) . Cell lines were grouped as pAKT responsive ( red columns ) and nonresponsive ( black columns ) according to the level of pAKT inhibition by trastuzumab . 25 % inhibition was used as a cutoff for the response .

( 2002 ) describe a robust initial increase in pHER3 after treatment for 1 hr with trastuzumab , followed by slow dephosphorylation after 12 – 24 hr . In contrast , we detect a rapid dephosphorylation of HER3 ( Tyr1289 ) , visible already after 10 min of treatment with trastuzumab in SKBR - 3 and BT474 - M1 cells . The degree of inhi - bition plateaus at 80 % after 60 min and was maintained for 6 hr ( Figure 1B ; Figure S1A , available online ) . HER3 dephosphoryla - tion was also reﬂected in loss of total phosphotyrosine and thus is not speciﬁc for Tyr1289 ( Figure S1B ) . Basal pHER3 is not derived from ligand activation based on the following : ( 1 ) no exogenous ligand is used in the experiments ; ( 2 ) the cells do not express HER3 ligands ; ( 3 ) extended serum starvation does not affect pHER3 . Trastuzumab is also reported to decrease HER2 phosphorylation ( Lane et al . , 2000 ) . In contrast , we did not detect inhibition of HER2 phosphorylation ( Figure S1B ) . Dephosphorylation of HER3 led to an immediate dissociation of thep85subunitofPI3KfromHER3 ( Figure1C ) . AKTdephosphor - ylation ( Ser473 , Thr308 ) followed similar kinetics . Maximal inhibi - tion was reached in 15 – 60 min ( Figure 1B ; Figures S1A and S1B ) . Dephosphorylation of the AKT substrate PRAS40 ( Thr246 ) pro - ceeded to a similar magnitude of inhibition and with parallel kinetics ( Figure 1B ) . Sergina et al . ( 2007 ) reported that small - molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors decrease HER3 and AKTphosphorylation , butfailtomaintaindephosphorylationafter long - term incubation . In contrast , inhibition of HER3 and AKT phosphorylation was sustained after 4 days of treatment with trastuzumab ( Figure 1D ) . In conclusion , trastuzumab causes an immediate and potent inhibition of the HER3 / PI3K / AKT pathway that is maintained for at least 4 days . The kinetics and magnitude ofpathwayinhibition suggestthattheeffecthasanimportantrole in the trastuzumab response . Trastuzumab - Induced Growth Inhibition Correlates with HER3 / PI3K / AKT Pathway Inhibition In Vitro We next analyzed whether the strong effect on the HER3 / PI3K / AKT pathway is predictive of antiproliferative responses in high - HER2 - expressing cell lines . We selected a set of breast cancer cells known to overexpress HER2 ( SKBR - 3 , BT474 - M1 , AU - 565 , HCC - 1419 , ZR75 - 30 , KPL - 4 , JIMT - 1 , BT474 - EEI , and HCC - 1954 ) , a low - HER2 - expressing breast cancer cell line ( MCF - 7 ) , and HER2 - overexpressing lung , ovarian , and gastric cancer cell lines ( CALU - 3 , SKOV - 3 , and MKN - 7 , respectively ) . Treatment of the cells with trastuzumab for 2 hr caused a strong and dose - dependent ( Figures 1E and 1F ) decrease in AKT phos - phorylation ( 60 % – 45 % ) in ﬁve HER2 - overexpressing breast cancer cell lines ( SKBR - 3 , BT474 - M1 , AU - 565 , HCC - 1419 , and ZR75 - 30 ) . No AKT dephosphorylation was detected in other cell lines ( Figure 1E ) . All of the cell lines express detectable levels of HER3 ( Figure S2 ) . Inhibition of proliferation corresponded with the ability of tras - tuzumab toinhibit pAKT . In SKBR - 3 cells , trastuzumab treatment inhibited both pAKT and proliferation by 50 % – 60 % ; in contrast , no inhibition was detected in either pAKT or proliferation in KPL - 4 cells ( Figure 1F ) . Cell lines were grouped as pAKT respon - sive ( > 25 % pAKT inhibition by 10 m g / ml trastuzumab ) and pAKT nonresponsive ( < 25 % pAKT inhibition by 10 m g / ml trastuzumab ) . Inhibition of proliferation strongly correlated with the ability of trastuzumab to inhibit pAKT ( p < 0 . 0001 ; t test at 1 m g / ml trastu - zumab ; Figure 1G ) . All HER - family receptors are capable of activating the MEK / ERK pathway ( Hynes and Lane , 2005 ) . Moreover , trastuzumab was reported to inhibit ERK phosphorylation ( Yakes et al . , 2002 ) . We treated two trastuzumab - sensitive cell lines ( SKBR - 3 , BT474 - M1 ) with the allosteric MEK inhibitor PD0325901 ( Solit et al . , 2006 ) . Although the MEK inhibition resulted in dephos - phorylation of ERK , the inhibitor had a minimal effect on cell proliferation ( Figure S3 ) , suggesting that the inhibitory effect of trastuzumab on the MEK / ERK pathway is not sufﬁcient for inhi - bition of proliferation . This result is consistent with previous similar experiments with BT474 xenografts ( Solit et al . , 2006 ) . In conclusion , the ability of trastuzumab to inhibit in vitro proliferation correlates with HER3 / PI3K / AKT pathway inhibition , suggesting that the pathway inhibition is required for the antipro - liferative effects and indicating that activating modiﬁcations involving the PI3K pathway are a likely and important cause of trastuzumab resistance . The PI3K Inhibitor GDC - 0941 Inhibits the Proliferation of Both Trastuzumab - Sensitive and - Insensitive Cells To further investigate whether the HER3 / PI3K / AKT pathway is controlling the proliferation and survival of HER2 - ampliﬁed cells , we treated all cell lines with GDC - 0941 . GDC - 0941 inhibits p110 a , p110 b , and p110 d subunits of PI3K with strong selectivity over otherassayable kinases ( Folkes et al . , 2008 ) . Treatment with 250 nM GDC - 0941 for 2 hr resulted in 40 % – 85 % inhibition of pAKT in all cell lines tested ( Figure 2A ) . No substantial difference was observed in the degree of AKT dephosphorylation between trastuzumab - sensitive and - insensitive cells after GDC - 0941 treatment . The effect of GDC - 0941 on cell proliferation / viability was tested after 3 days of GDC - 0941 treatment . Inhibition of the PI3K / AKT pathway by GDC - 0941 was reﬂected as a dose - dependent reduction in cell proliferation / viability ( Figure 2B ) . GDC - 0941 inhibited the growth of both trastuzumab - sensitive and - insensitive cells ( Figures 2B and 2C ) . The IC 50 values for GDC - 0941rangedbetween150and950nManddidnotcorrelate with trastuzumab sensitivity ( p = 0 . 47 ; t test ; Figure 2D ) . These results conﬁrm that PI3K / AKT pathway activity is directly linked to the proliferation of HER2 - overexpressing cells . Trastuzumab Inhibits the Ligand - Independent HER2 / HER3 Interaction Our recent studies conﬁrmed that the complex of HER2 and HER3 is a critical oncogenic unit in HER2 - positive breast cancer cell lines ( Lee - Hoeﬂich et al . , 2008 ) . However , the initial effect of trastuzumab on the HER2 / HER3 complex is unclear . Previous studiesdemonstratedthattrastuzumabdoesnotinducedownre - gulation of HER2 ( Austin et al . , 2004 ) . Furthermore , trastuzumab does not reduce HER2 phosphorylation ( Figure S1B ) . Our previous report on the effect of trastuzumab on HER2 / HER3 association focused on ligand - activated HER2 / HER3 dimeriza - tion ( Agus et al . , 2002 ) . Using standard immunoprecipitation methods ( Agus et al . , 2002 ) ( Figure 3A , right panel ) , we were initially unable to detect a direct HER2 / HER3 interaction in the absence of ligand stimulation . We hypothesized that heregulin ( HRG ) / HER3 / HER2complexescouldbemorestableorabundant than the ligand - independent HER3 / HER2 complexes that were Cancer Cell Trastuzumab Disrupts the HER2 / HER3 / PI3K Complex Cancer Cell 15 , 429 – 440 , May 5 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 431 formed as a result of HER2 overexpression . It is likely that breast cancers that overexpress HER2 may be activated in both a ligand - independent and - dependent manner . To increase the sensitivity of the analysis , we utilized a reversible chemical cross - linkingprocedurewith3 , 3 - dithiobis [ sulfosuccinimidylpropionate ] ( DTSSP ) . This reagent crosslinks extracellular proteins through amino groups . Even weakly interacting protein complexes can then be coimmunoprecipitated . Protein complex compo - nents are identiﬁed by western blots after SDS - PAGE in reducing conditions , which reverses the crosslinking . Ligand - independent HER2 / HER3complexeswerereadilydetectedinSKBR - 3cellsby usingDTSSPcrosslinking ( Figure3A , leftpanel ) . TheHER2 / HER3 interaction was signiﬁcantly increased when cells were pre - treated with the HER3 ligand HRG ( Figure 3A ) . Consistent with previous reports , pertuzumab efﬁciently inhibited ligand - induced HER2 / HER3dimerization , whereastrastuzumabhadonlyaminor effect ( Figure 3A , right panel ) . Pertuzumab is a therapeutic antibodythatbindstheextracellulardomainIIofHER2andblocks theassociationofHER2withHER3whencellsarestimulatedwith HER3 ligand ( Agus et al . , 2002 ) . Interestingly , in the absence of HRG , the abilities of the antibodies to disrupt the ligand - indepen - dent HER2 / HER3 complex were reversed : the amount of HER3 associating with HER2 was clearly reduced when cells were treated with trastuzumab ( Figure 3A , left panel ) . Pertuzumab caused a minor decrease in HER3 in complex with HER2 ( Figure 3A , left panel ) . Next , we performed a series of coimmunoprecipitation exper - iments in the absence of the crosslinker . For this , we modiﬁed the immunoprecipitation protocol by omitting the zwitterionic detergent ( CHAPS ) from the lysis buffer , by increasing the amount of lysate , and by utilizing a more sensitive chemilumines - cent reagent . These modiﬁcations allowed us to detect ligand - independent HER2 / HER3 dimer in the absence of chemical crosslinking . The kinetics of HER3 release from the HER2 complex corresponded with inhibition of the pHER3 / pAKT pathway after trastuzumab treatment , occurring 5 – 15 min after trastuzumab addition ( Figure 3B ) . Moreover , trastuzumab dis - rupted the HER2 / HER3 interaction in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure 3C ) , corresponding with the concentrations typically required for AKT dephosphorylation ( Figure 1F ) and inhibition of proliferation ( Figure 1G ) . We further hypothesized that if displacement of HER3 from HER2 is essential for the antiproliferative activity of trastuzumab , then interfering with the HER2 / HER3 interaction should be proportional to inhibiting cell proliferation . As predicted , trastu - zumab inhibited pHER3 , pAKT , and the proliferation of BT474 - M1 cells more efﬁciently than pertuzumab ( Figures 3D – 3F ) . Together , these results demonstrate that trastuzumab treatment disrupts ligand - independent HER2 / HER3 association , which results in a rapid decrease of HER3 phosphorylation and PI3K / AKT pathway inactivation , ultimately leading to inhibition of cell proliferation . Trastuzumab and GDC - 0941 Synergistically Inhibit the PI3K / AKT Pathway and Cell Proliferation Since both trastuzumab and GDC - 0941 inhibit the PI3K / AKT pathway , combining these inhibitors might result in additive or synergistic effects on the proliferation of trastuzumab - sensitive cell lines . Treatment of BT474 - M1 with 10 m g / ml trastuzumab caused an equal decrease in pAKT as 100 nM GDC - 0941 treat - ment ( 63 % and 63 % inhibition , respectively ; Figure 4A ) . Addition of trastuzumab to GDC - 0941 caused a dose - dependent , enhanced decrease in pAKT ( Figure 4A ) . The addition of 10 m g / ml trastuzumab resulted in a 67 % reduction in pAKT compared to 50 nM GDC - 0941 treatment alone . Next , we evaluated whether the downstream AKT signaling components were affected . The addition of trastuzumab to Figure 2 . The PI3K Inhibitor GDC - 0941 Inhibits the Growth of Both Trastuzumab - Sensitive and - Insensitive HER2 - Ampliﬁed Cells ( A ) Cells were treated with or without 250 nM GDC - 0941 for 2 hr , lysed , and subjected to pAKT ELISA ( Ser473 ) . Cell lines were grouped as trastuzumab - sensitive ( red columns ) and - insensitive ( black columns ) according to prolifer - ationinhibitionbytrastuzumab ( Figure1G ) . 25 % inhibitionwasusedasacutoff for the sensitivity .

( D ) Trastuzumab and GDC - 0941 IC 50 values ( ± standard error ) from the prolif - eration / viability assays ( Figures 1G and [ C ] ) .

GDC - 0941furtherdecreasedthephosphorylation ofadirectAKT substrate , PRAS40 ( Thr246 ) , and a distal substrate , phospho - S6 ribosomal protein ( Ser235 / 236 ) , demonstrating that trastuzumab and GDC - 0941 exhibit a pronounced combinatorial effect on downstream AKT signaling ( Figure 4B ) . Sergina et al . ( 2007 ) recently reported a compensatory feedback from PI3K inhibition that results in elevated pHER3 . A similar compensatory effect on pHER3 is seen when using GDC - 0941 ( Figure 4B ) . However , addition of trastuzumab efﬁciently blocks this compensatory effect ( Figure 4B ) . We next addressed whether enhanced PI3K / AKT pathway inhibition results in decreased cell proliferation / viability . In the absence of trastuzumab , the IC 50 value for GDC - 0941 in a 6 - day treatment of BT474 - M1 was 296 nM ( Figure 4C ) . The addition of trastuzumab to GDC - 0941 caused a dose - dependent decrease in cell proliferation / viability . Addition of 10 m g / ml trastuzumab resulted in a 64 % decrease in the concentration of GDC - 0941 thatisrequiredtoreachitsIC 50 of106nM . Asimilarcombinatorial effect on pAKT and inhibition of proliferation was also observed with SKBR - 3 cells ( data not shown ) , but not when the trastuzu - mab - insensitive KPL - 4 cells were treated ( Figure S4 ) . Prolifera - tion data were analyzed by the established method of Chou and Talalay ( 1984 ) by using CalcuSyn software . The resulting combination index ( C . I . ) values were < 1 over most of the effect range of the drugs ( fractional effect 0 . 3 – 0 . 8 ) , demonstrating that the combination of trastuzumab and GDC - 0941 inhibits proliferation synergistically in BT474 and SKBR - 3 cells ( Figure 4D ) . Together , these data show that combining trastuzu - mabandGDC - 0941enhances theinhibitoryeffectonAKTandits downstream targets , resulting in a synergistic effect on the prolif - eration of trastuzumab - sensitive breast cancer cells . Our results also demonstrate that trastuzumab blocks the compensatory negative - feedback loop caused by GDC - 0941 treatment ( Figure 4B ) , providing a plausible molecular mechanism that promotes the synergistic effect observed with trastuzumab - GDC - 0941 combination treatment . Combination of Trastuzumab and GDC - 0941 Induces Apoptosis of Breast Cancer Cells Toinvestigatetheeffectofthetrastuzumab - GDC - 0941combina - tion on apoptosis , BT474 - M1 cells were treated for 48 hr with both inhibitors . Combining trastuzumab and GDC - 0941 increased the accumulation of cleaved caspase - 3 fragments , indicating activation of this key effector caspase ( Figure 4E ) . Combining trastuzumab and GDC - 0941 also resulted in an increase in the cleaved PARP 89 kDa fragment , a known response to caspase - 3 activation ( Figure 4E ) . The activity of cas - pases 3 and 7 was also increased when trastuzumab was added to GDC - 0941 treatment ( Figure 4F , left panel ) . Combining trastu - zumab with 250 nM GDC - 0941 increased caspase activity to a level similar to that detected with a 4 - fold higher dose ( 1000 nM ) of GDC - 0941 alone . Importantly , this increase in caspase activity wasreﬂectedintheapoptotic indexofthese cells . Theadditionof 10 m g / ml trastuzumab dramatically decreased the concentration of GDC - 0941 required to induce apoptosis ( Figure 4F , middle panel ) . A near equivalent level of apoptosis was detected when cells were treated with 100 nM GDC - 0941 and trastuzumab than when treated with 1000 nM GDC - 0941 alone . As expected , the increase in apoptosis was reﬂected in a decrease in cell viability after 48 hr ( Figure 4F , right panel ) . A similar increase in caspase activity and apoptosis was observed with SKBR - 3 cells ( datanotshown ) . Together , thesedatashowthatthecombination Figure3 .

Therefore , trastuzumab treatment sensitizes HER2 - ampliﬁed cells to PI3K inhibition and thus provides an additional level of tumor speciﬁcity for the PI3K inhibitor GDC - 0941 . Activating PIK3CA Mutation Results in Independence from HER2 / HER3 Signaling and Trastuzumab Resistance in MDA - MB - 361 . 1 Cells Mutations in PIK3CA , the gene encoding the catalytic p110 a subunit , can be found in 30 % of breast tumors ( Vogt et al . , 2007 ) . PIK3CA mutations are clustered in ‘‘hot spots’’ of kinase and helical domains , and 80 % of the cancer - speciﬁc mutations lead to a single amino acid substitution : E542K , E545K , or H1047R ( Vogt et al . , 2007 ) . These ‘‘hot spot mutations’’ increase the activity of the kinase , can transform cells , and are oncogenic in vivo . Activating PIK3CA mutations have also been suggested to confer trastuzumab resistance ( Berns et al . , 2007 ) . The MDA - MB - 361 . 1 breast cancer cell line harbors HER2 ampliﬁcation and an activating PIK3CA mutation ( E545K ) . Trastuzumab caused a similar decrease in pHER3 in MDA - MB - 361 . 1 ( Fig - ure 5A ) as was detected in trastuzumab - sensitive SKBR - 3 cells ( Figure 1B ) . Dephosphorylation of HER3 also led to the dissocia - tionofbothp85andp110subunitsofPI3KfromHER3 ( Figure5B ) , again similar to the trastuzumab - sensitive SKBR - 3 ( Figure 1C ) . Despite the similar signaling changes seen upstream of PI3K upon trastuzumab treatment , no decrease in pAKT was detected ( Figure 5C ) , Accordingly , MDA - MB - 361 . 1 cells also show resis - tance to trastuzumab in cell proliferation assays ( Figure 5D ) . However , GDC - 0941 efﬁciently inhibited AKT phosphorylation ( Figure 5E ) and cell proliferation , as well as survival ( IC 50 of 443 nM ; Figure 5F ) , conﬁrming that MDA - MB - 361 . 1 proliferation is dependent on the PI3K / AKT pathway . In contrast , the prolifera - tion of MDA - MB - 361 . 1 cells is not dependent on the HER2 / HER3 oncogenic unit , as the cells retain proliferation capability when treated with HER2 or HER3 siRNA ( Figure 5G ) . Proliferation of trastuzumab - sensitive cells , however , is abolished by siRNA knockdown of either HER2 or HER3 ( Figure 5H ) ( Lee - Hoeﬂich et al . , 2008 ) . We also investigated the ability of GDC - 0941 to inhibit proliferation of other HER2 - ampliﬁed cells that harbor PIK3CA mutations . HCC - 202 , HCC - 1954 , and MDA - MB - 453 cells express high levels of HER2 and have an activating PIK3CA mutation ( E545K , H1047R , and H1047R , respectively ) .

Most of the trastuzu - mab - resistant cells carried the activating PIK3CA mutation or were PTEN null ( Figure S2 ) . In contrast , no hot spot mutations were detected in the trastuzumab - sensitive cell lines ( Figure S2 ) . Together , these studies demonstrate that an activating hot spot mutation in PIK3CA uncouples PI3K activity from the HER2 / HER3 oncogenic unit , which , in turn , renders these cell lines insensitive to trastuzumab treatment . Furthermore , trastu - zumab - resistant , HER2 - ampliﬁed breast cancer cells with PI3K mutations are sensitive to the PI3K inhibitor GDC - 0941 . It is likely that GDC - 0941 would be useful in the treatment of breast cancer where activating PIK3CA mutations cause or contribute to tras - tuzumab resistance . HER2 - Ampliﬁed Breast Cancer Cells that Are Resistant to Trastuzumab Due to Loss of PTEN Are Sensitive to GDC - 0941 PTEN loss occurs commonly in breast tumors , can lead to acti - vation of the PI3K / AKT pathway , and has been suggested to cause trastuzumab resistance ( Nagata et al . , 2004 ) . We addressed whether GDC - 0941 can overcome trastuzumab resistance caused by PTEN loss . Transfection of SKBR - 3 cells with PTEN siRNA resulted in a 76 % reduction of PTEN protein and in a modest increase in pAKT ( 114 % of CTRL siRNA treated Figure 5 .

Consistent with previous reports ( Nagata et al . , 2004 ) , knockdown of PTEN resulted in trastuzumab resis - tance ( Figure 6A ) . Although PTEN loss increased the GDC - 0941 concentration required for inhibition of proliferation , complete inhibition was achieved with 1 m M concentration , demonstrating that GDC - 0941 inhibits the growth of SKBR - 3 cells that were made resistant to trastuzumab due to PTEN loss . A similar result was achieved with BT474 - M1 cells ( data not shown ) . HCC - 1569 is an HER2 - ampliﬁed breast cancer cell line that does not express detectable amounts of PTEN ( Figure S2 ) . HCC - 1569 cells are resistant to trastuzumab ( Figure 6B ) . Treatment of HCC - 1569 with GDC - 0941 resulted in inhibition of AKT phosphorylation and inhibition of proliferation ( IC 50 of 313 nM ) ( Figure 6B ) . Together , the results show that GDC - 0941 effectively inhibits both proliferation and the viability of HER2 - ampliﬁed breast cancer cells that are resistant to tras - tuzumab due to PTEN loss , suggesting a clinical niche for this PI3K inhibitor .

Aftertumorestablishment , themiceweretreatedwith 3 mg / kg weekly doses of trastuzumab or vehicle . After the third trastuzumab dose , it was apparent that the MDA - MB - 361 . 1 tumors did not respond to trastuzumab in vivo ( Figure 7A ) . No Cancer Cell Trastuzumab Disrupts the HER2 / HER3 / PI3K Complex Cancer Cell 15 , 429 – 440 , May 5 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 435 responses were observed even with a higher 30 mg / kg weekly trastuzumab dose , which causes complete responses in trastu - zumab - sensitive models ( data not shown ) . At day 17 of the tras - tuzumab treatment , both vehicle and trastuzumab groups were randomly divided in half . Daily oral administration of GDC - 0941 at 150 mg / kg was delivered to half of the mice , whereas the other half received the formulation buffer of the PI3K inhibitor . Addition of GDC - 0941 to the dose regimen stopped the growth of MDA - MB - 361 . 1 tumors , whereas tumors continued to grow in vehicle - treated mice ( Figure 7A ) . Response to treatment was monitored as time to tumor progression ( the time when tumor volume reached twice the volume on day 17 ) . GDC - 0941 signiﬁcantly delayed the tumor progression both alone and in combination with trastuzumab ( p = 0 . 0049 , p = 0 . 0018 , respectively ) . The in vivo combination of trastuzumab and GDC - 0941 did not result in a signiﬁcant beneﬁt over the single - agent GDC - 0941 regimen . Increased PARP cleavage was detected in tumors treated for 7 – 24 hr with 100 – 150 mg / kg PI3K inhibitor , suggesting that GDC - 0941 induces apoptosis in tumors ( data not shown ) . In summary , these results demonstrate that GDC - 0941 is effective in treating HER2 - ampliﬁed , trastuzumab - resistant mammary tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations in vivo . The combination of Trastuzumab and GDC - 0941 Is Efﬁcient in Treatment of Trastuzumab - Sensitive Tumors In Vivo To address whether the trastuzumab and GDC - 0941 combina - tion would result in more efﬁcient inhibition of tumor growth than the single agents , we treated BT474 - M1 tumor xenografts with trastuzumab ( 20 mg / kg , iv , 2 3 / wk 3 3 ) , GDC - 0941 ( 100 mg / kg , po , qd 3 21 ) , or a combination of the agents . As pre - dicted by the in vitro studies , the combination of inhibitors was more efﬁcient in inhibition of the BT474 - M1 tumors than either of the single agents ( Figure 7B ) . DISCUSSION Clinical observations indicate that not all patients beneﬁt from trastuzumab - based therapies . Moreover , a subset of patients progress after an initial response . The nature of both innate and acquired resistance is an area of active research in both the laboratory and the clinic . In the present work , we show that the antiproliferative activity of trastuzumab is directly linked to its ability to disrupt the constitutive , ligand - independent HER2 / HER3 / PI3K signaling complex that forms as a result of HER2 Figure 7 .

Furthermore , we describe how PI3K mutations generate trastuzumab resistance and that trastuzumab - resistant cell lines commonly harbor activating ‘‘hot spot’’ PI3K mutations or are PTEN null . Additionally , we demonstrate that the selective PI3K inhibitor GDC - 0941 signiﬁcantly inhibits proliferation of both trastuzumab - sensitive and - insensitive cell lines . Several studies have noted that trastuzumab treatment leads to a downregulation of AKT signaling ( Lane et al . , 2000 ; Yakes et al . , 2002 ) . We recently extended this observation by showing that HER2 and HER3 form the major oncogenic unit in HER2 - positive breast cancer ( Lee - Hoeﬂich et al . , 2008 ) . However , the molecular details concerning the mechanism by which trastuzu - mab disrupts constitutive AKT signaling remains elusive . In the present work , we provide direct evidence for the ability of trastu - zumab to disrupt the oncogenic ligand - independent HER2 / HER3 / PI3K complex , resulting in rapid inhibition of AKT signaling and cell proliferation . Our results clarify several previously unclear areas of signaling changes caused by trastuzumab . We establish that inhibition of HER3 phosphorylation and the subsequent dissociation of p85 , which , in turn , leads to downre - gulation of AKT signaling , is an immediate effect after trastuzu - mab treatment and correlates with the disruption of HER2 / HER3 complexes . Previous studies have reported much slower kinetics for the inhibition of HER3 / AKT signaling ( Yakes et al . , 2002 ) , which was attributed to downregulation of HER2 from the cell surface ( Hudziak et al . , 1989 ) . However , subsequent studies clearly indicate that trastuzumab treatment does not alter cell surface HER2 levels ( Austin et al . , 2004 ; Hommelgaard et al . , 2004 ) . We also fail to observe any transient increase in HER3 or HER2 phosphorylation after trastuzumab treatment that was reported in previous studies ( Sarup et al . , 1991 ; Yakes et al . , 2002 ) . Additionally , we do not observe the trastuzumab - mediated HER2 dephosphorylation that had been suggested as the mechanism of action for trastuzumab ( Lane et al . , 2000 ; Nagata et al . , 2004 ; Sarup et al . , 1991 ) . We conclude from our results that the inhibition of PI3K / AKT signaling by trastuzumab is caused by disruption of ligand - independent HER2 / HER3 association , which , in turn , is critical for the cytostatic activity of trastuzumab . Our model does not require trastuzumab - medi - ated activation of PTEN through src for trastuzumab to mediate its antisignaling activity ( Nagata et al . , 2004 ) . However , some of the previously described mechanisms of action , including the ability to inhibit HER2 shedding ( Molina et al . , 2001 ) , may still be valid in some context . Previously , we reported that pertuzumab , a therapeutic anti - body that binds extracellular domain II of HER2 ( Franklin et al . , 2004 ) , functions by blocking the association of HER2 with ligand - occupied HER3 ( Agus et al . , 2002 ) . In contrast , trastuzu - mab , which binds to subdomain IV of HER2 , had little effect on ligand - mediated HER2 / HER3 association ( Agus et al . , 2002 ) . In the present study , we demonstrate that HER2 / HER3 complexes can be isolated from cell lines that overexpress HER2 without stimulating receptor dimerization by ligand . In the absence of HRG , trastuzumab is superior to pertuzumab in disrupting constitutive HER2 / HER3 complexes . These ﬁndings raise the possibility that when HER2 is overexpressed and in the absence of ligand , the HER2 / HER3 interaction is fundamentally different from the canonical ligand - induced , receptor - mediated dimeriza - tion model proposed by structural studies . The ﬁndings further imply that the domain II - domain II interface may not mediate interactions in the ligand - independent receptor complex . The ability to detect HER2 in association with HER3 conﬁrms and extends the notion that the oncogenic unit in HER2 - positive breast cancer is a complex of HER2 and HER3 that signals constitutively to PI3K and AKT ( Lee - Hoeﬂich et al . , 2008 ) . One hypothesis , supported by studies of Landgraf and colleagues , is that HER2 / HER3 complexes exist in the membrane in micro - domains , and that subsequent binding of monoclonal antibodies to HER2 accelerates the partitioning of HER2 away from these microdomains , thereby limiting access to HER3 ( Kani et al . , 2005 ) . Trastuzumab , which binds near the transmembrane region in domain IV , appears to be more effective in accelerating this partitioning event . Experiments to test this hypothesis are currently ongoing . It is clear that the oncogenic potential of HER2 in HER2 - ampli - ﬁed breast cancer is primarily , if not solely , mediated by its ability to inappropriately activate HER3 and the PI3K pathway ( sche - matically depicted in Figure 8A ) ( Lee - Hoeﬂich et al . , 2008 ) . In the current study , we demonstrate that trastuzumab can disrupt the ligand - independent HER2 / HER3 / PI3K complex in both tras - tuzumab - sensitive ( Figure 8A ) and - insensitive cells ( Figure 8B ) . In the latter case , the breast cancer cell lines that harbor alter - ations in the PI3K pathway remain sensitive to GDC - 0941 , a highly speciﬁc and effective PI3K inhibitor ( Figure 8B ) . Several properties that are critical for therapeutic agents differentiate GDC - 0941 from previously tested PI3K inhibitors , including wortmannin and LY294002 ( Bain et al . , 2007 ; Hennessy et al . , 2005 ; Nagata et al . , 2004 ) . First , GDC - 0941 is highly selective for class IA PI3K ( Folkes et al . , 2008 ) . Importantly , it also displays favorable pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties that enable therapeutic use in vivo ( Folkes et al . , 2008 ) . Given this advantageous proﬁle , GDC - 0941 is currently undergoing early clinical testing for treatment of various advanced malignancies . A recent publication showed that a dual PI3K / mTOR inhibitor is able to inhibit growth of tumors with PIK3CA mutation . However , the study did not demonstrate whether PI3K / mTOR inhibitor overcomes trastuzumab resistance in vivo ( Serra et al . , 2008 ) . In trastuzumab - sensitive cells , trastuzumab and GDC - 0941 inhibit proliferation and cell viability synergistically . Recently , it was reported that PI3K inhibition leads to a compensatory increase in HER3 phosphorylation , which was linked to AKT - mediated negative - feedback signaling ( Sergina et al . , 2007 ) . In the present report , we observe that treatment of HER2 - ampliﬁed breast cancer cells with GDC - 0941 also results in negative feed - back that is manifested by an increase in HER3 phosphorylation . When trastuzumab is given with GDC - 0941 , the feedback loop fails due to the disruption of the HER2 / HER3 complex . As a consequence of feedback loop failure , trastuzumab and GDC - 0941 are observed to be synergistic in cells that are sensi - tive to trastuzumab’s antiproliferative effects . Several clinical implications can be drawn from our studies . First , PI3Kinhibitors , suchasGDC - 0941 , couldbeusedincombi - nation with trastuzumab - based therapies , and , based on our current study , it is anticipated that the combination will be highly effective . Second , GDC - 0941 may be effective in patients who progress on trastuzumab or lapatinib therapy . Third , patients whose tumors contain HER2 gene ampliﬁcation and also harbor PI3K pathway alterations are candidates for GDC - 0941 therapy Cancer Cell Trastuzumab Disrupts the HER2 / HER3 / PI3K Complex Cancer Cell 15 , 429 – 440 , May 5 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 437 and are not likely to optimally respond to trastuzumab - based regimens . Our mechanistic studies predict that these patients would also be refractory to HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors , such as lapatinib , in agreement with a previous report ( Eichhorn et al . , 2008 ) . Fourth , our studies suggest that it is imperative to clinically validate whether patients who initially respond to trastu - zumab or lapatinib therapy and then progress acquire PI3K pathway alterations . Only detailed molecular analysis of longitu - dinal biopsy specimens from the same patient’s tumor under - going these therapies will provide deﬁnitive data in support of this hypothesis . In summary , this study characterizes a mechanism of action for trastuzumab whereby trastuzumab disrupts basal , ligand - independent HER2 / HER3 interactions in HER2 - ampliﬁed cells . The disruption of the constitutively active receptor complex leads to rapid inhibition of the HER3 / PI3K / AKT pathway and cell proliferation . We also show that the PI3K inhibitor GDC - 0941 is highly efﬁcacious both in combination with trastuzumab and in the treatment of trastuzumab - resistant cells and tumors . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Lines Breast cancer cell lines BT474 - M1 , BT474 - EEI , and MDA - MB - 361 . 1 are in vivo - passaged subclones of BT474 and MDA - MB - 361 cells ( American TypeCultureCollection [ ATCC ] , Manassas , VA ) . Thegeneration ofBT474sub - clones has been previously described ( Clynes et al . , 2000 ; LewisPhillips et al . , 2008 ) . For in vivo passaging of MDA - MB - 361 , the parental cell lines were grown as xenografts , and the tumors were regrafted once . A new cell line ( MDA - MB - 361 . 1 ) was generated from the in vivo - passaged tumors and was used in all in vitro and in vivo experiments . KPL - 4 breast cancer cells were obtained from J . Kurebayashi ( Kurebayashi et al . , 1999 ) , and MKN - 7 gastric carcinoma cells were obtained from Mitsubishi Corp . ( Tokyo , Japan ) . All other celllineswereobtained fromATCCorDeutsche Sammlung vonMikroorganis - menund ZellkulturenGmbH ( DSMZ , Braunschweig , Germany ) . Celllines were maintained in high - glucose DMEM : Ham’s F - 12 ( 50 : 50 ) supplemented with 10 % FBS and 2 mM L - glutamine . Analysis of HER3 / PI3K / AKT Pathway Activation Cells were lysed with nondenaturing lysis buffer including 1 % Triton ( Cell Signaling Technology [ CST ] Cat # 9803 ; Danvers , MA ) . The activation of the HER3 / PI3K / AKT pathway was detected by using antibodies against pHER3 ( Tyr1289 ; CST ) , phospho - S6 ribosomal protein ( Ser235 / 236 ; CST ) , and pPRAS40 ( Thr246 ; Invitrogen / Biosource , Carlsbad , CA ) . AKT phosphorylation was detected by western blot or ELISA detecting phosphorylated Ser473 ( CST ) . The association of PI3K with HER3 was analyzed by immunoprecipita - tionwithagarose - conjugatedHER3antibody ( sc - 285 ; SantaCruz , SantaCruz , CA ) , followed by detection with p85 ( Millipore / Upstate , Billerica , MA ) or p110 antibody ( clone EP383Y ; Epitomics , Burlingame , CA ) .

Tumors were snap frozen and homogenized in cell lysis buffer ( CST ; Cat # 9803 ) . Ratios of pHER3 to total HER3 and pAKT to total AKT were determined by western blot and ELISA , respectively . Receptor Crosslinking and HER2 Coimmunoprecipitation SKBR - 3 cells were incubated in growth medium with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 2 ) for 1 hr at 37 (cid:3) C with the indicated treatment anti - body . The cells were washed twice with ice - cold 50 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 150 mM NaCl ( HEPES / NaCl buffer ) and were incubated with 2 mM 3 , 3 0 - dithio - bis [ sulfosuccinimidylpropionate ] ( DTSSP ) dissolved in HEPES / NaCl buffer for 60 min at 4 (cid:3) C . After the incubation with DTSSP , the cells were washed three times with ice - cold 25 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 1 ) , 150 mM NaCl and lysed in 1 . 0 % v / v Triton X - 100 , 1 . 0 % w / v CHAPS in RPMI with 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 2 ) supple - mentedwithproteaseandphosphataseinhibitors . ForHER2immunoprecipita - tion , N - terminal anti - HER2 antibody 7C2 ( Genentech ; binds to extracellular domain I of HER2 ) was conjugated to Ultralink biosupport ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) by incubation in 100 mM HEPES ( pH 8 . 2 ) , 150 mM NaCl buffer in 4 (cid:3) C over - night .

Lysate ( 1 [ Figure 3A ] to 3 mg [ Figures 3B and 3C ] ) was used for overnight immunoprecipitation in 4 (cid:3) C with 20 m l 7C2 beads . After immunoprecipitation , 7C2 beads were washed twice withlysisbuffer . SDS - samplebuffercontaininganadditional50mMdithiothrei - tol was added to each precipitate , and the samples were boiled for 4 min . Coimmunoprecipitating HER3 was analyzed by western blot with C - terminal HER3 antibody ( sc - 285 ; Santa Cruz ) . siRNA siRNA was introduced into BT474 - M1 cells ( 1 . 7 3 10 4 / well of 96 - well plate ) by reverse transfection by using Lipofectamine - 2000 ( Invitrogen ) as previously Figure 8 .

Cell Proliferation / Viability Proliferation / viability ofcells wasdetected byusing the CellTiter - Glo Lumines - cent Cell Viability Assay ( Promega , Madison , WI ) . For the assay , 5 3 10 3 cells were plated on 96 - well plates and incubated overnight for cell attachment . Cells were treated for 6 days with antibodies or 3 days with PI3K inhibitor before analysis . After transfection with siRNA , proliferation was detected by a [ 3 H ] thymidine incorporation assay after 48 hr of treatment as previously described ( Lee - Hoeﬂich et al . , 2008 ) . All measurements were performed in triplicate . Determination of Drug Synergy Cellswereseededatadensityof2 . 5 3 10 3 ( BT474 ) or1 . 5 3 10 3 ( SKBR - 3 ) cells per well of a 384 - well plate . Concentration ranges were chosen to span the complete dose - response range of both drugs . All treatments were performed in quadruplicate . Cell proliferation / viability was determined after 3 days by using the Luminescent Cell Viability Assay ( Promega ) . Multiple drug effect analysis was performed by using CalcuSyn software ( Biosoft , Cambridge , United Kingdom ) , which quantitatively describes the interaction between twoormoredrugs ( ChouandTalalay , 1984 ) . Thismethodassignscombination index ( C . I . ) values to each drug combination and deﬁnes drug synergy when a C . I . value is less than 1 or drug antagonism when a C . I . value is greater than 1 . C . I . values were determined at 7 – 9 unique data points for each cell line , which corresponded to 20 % – 90 % of cell growth inhibition relative to control . Caspase Activation and Apoptosis Fordetectionofcaspaseactivityandapoptosis , 1 . 5 3 10 4 cellswereplatedon 96 - well plates and incubated overnight before 48 hr treatments and the Cas - pase - Glo3 / 7assay ( Promega ) orCellDeathDetectionELISA plus assay ( Roche ; measures cytoplasmic histone - associated DNA fragments indicative of apoptosis ) . Cleaved caspase - 3 ( Asp175 ; 5A1 ) and cleaved PARP ( Asp214 ) were detected with antibodies that do not recognize the respective full - length proteins ( CST ) . In Vivo Drug Efﬁcacy ForMDA - MB - 361 . 1xenograftstudies , NCRnudemice ( Taconic ) weresupple - mented withsubcutaneous estrogen pellets ( 0 . 36 mg , 60 - day release ; Innova - tive Research of America ) . After 3 days , 5 million MDA - MB - 361 . 1 cells were injected into the mammary fat pad in a 1 : 1 HBSS : matrigel suspension ( BD matrigel ; BD Biosystems , San Jose , CA ) . When tumor volumes reached 200 – 300 mm 3 , mice were randomly grouped for the treatment cohorts . For BT474 - M1 xenograft studies , 1 mm 3 tumor fragments were implanted subcu - taneously in the ﬂank of the mice ( Fox Chase SCID , C . B - 17 / IcrHsd - Prkdc scid , Harlan ) . When tumor volumes reached an average of 125 mm 3 , mice were randomized for treatment groups . Dosing and drug are described in the ﬁgure legends . Tumor volumes were calculated withthe formula : ( mm 3 ) = ( L 3 W 2 ) 3 0 . 5 . All animal procedures followed protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) . Statistical Analysis All statistical analysiswasperformedby using JMP 7 . 0 software ( SAS Institute Inc . , Cary , NC ) .
