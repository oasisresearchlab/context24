Since January 2020 Elsevier has created a COVID - 19 resource centre with free information in English and Mandarin on the novel coronavirus COVID - 19 . The COVID - 19 resource centre is hosted on Elsevier Connect , the company ' s public news and information website . Elsevier hereby grants permission to make all its COVID - 19 - related research that is available on the COVID - 19 resource centre - including this research content - immediately available in PubMed Central and other publicly funded repositories , such as the WHO COVID database with rights for unrestricted research re - use and analyses in any form or by any means with acknowledgement of the original source . These permissions are granted for free by Elsevier for as long as the COVID - 19 resource centre remains active . Correspondence Prevalence of comorbid asthma in COVID - 19 patients Q 1 To the Editor : The article by Li et al 1 titled ‘‘Risk factors for severity and mortality in adult COVID - 19 inpatients in Wuhan’’ provides much - needed detail to inform risk assessment in the presence of preexisting comorbidities in such patients . Given the potentially protracted time line for complete eradication of the public health threat from coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , there is an ur - gent need for such data to clarify the risk to severe acute respira - tory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) - infected patients with asthma , particularly because severe asthma represents a sizable patient group included in public health advice to shield / stay home . 2 Surprisingly , the authors report a low prevalence of asthma ( 0 . 9 % [ 5 of 548 ] ) in patients with COVID - 19 , markedly lower than in the adult population of Wuhan ( 6 . 4 % ) and hence speculate that there may be a T H 2 - mediated reduced susceptibil - ity to COVID - 19 in patients with asthma . 1 A recent literature review including an additional 12 predominantly Chinese COVID - 19 cohorts / cases ( 874 patients ) showed that asthma was ‘‘surprisingly underreported , ’’ 3 and entirely absent in a Chinese nationwide analysis of 1590 COVID - 19 cases , where a lack of chronic airways disease awareness and lack of community spiro - metric testing were postulated reasons . 4 In contrast , a more recent case series from New York of 393 consecutive conﬁrmed COVID - 19 admissions documented a rate of asthma of 12 . 5 % , slightly higher than the prevalence of current adult asthma of 10 . 1 % in New York state . 5 , 6 As a Euro - pean comparison of asthma prevalence in hospitalized patients with COVID - 19 , and with local institutional review board approval , we conducted a retrospective study in our 836 - bed tertiary referral center in Dublin , Ireland . We assessed the med - ical records of 193 consecutive admissions who were SARS - CoV - 2 – positive over a 1 - month period and found that 8 . 8 % ( 17 of 193 ) had a physician diagnosis of asthma . Although most of these patients with comorbid asthma had a milder inpa - tient course and none required invasive mechanical ventilation , there was 1 death , related to COVID - 19 and other life - limiting comorbidities ( Table I ½ T1 (cid:2) ) . The herein - reported rate of comorbid asthma diagnosis is higher than that reported by Li et al , and is comparable to the estimated prevalence of current asthma of 7 . 0 % in adults in Ireland . 7 We theorize that the rate of comorbid asthma in our urban center in Ireland reﬂects the complex interaction of perhaps greater susceptibility to symptomatic COVID - 19 in asthma and an increasingly forewarned and engaged patient population with asthma who may have recently improved their asthma medicine adherence and anticipated / better adhered to public health advice than others in advance of widespread community transmission in their geographic region . We suspect that the low comorbid asthma prevalence observed by Li et al is less likely to indicate lower susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 in asthma , in light of the above emerging data . 1 , 4 , 5 There remains a need for larger , more detailed epidemiologic and mechanistic studies for clariﬁcation to what extent COVID - 19 poses a risk to patients of deﬁned asthma severity .
