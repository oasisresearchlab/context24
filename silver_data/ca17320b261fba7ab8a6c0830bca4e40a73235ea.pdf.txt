Reasoning and Learning by Analogy Introduction Dedre Gentner Keith J . Holyoak Analogy is a powerful cognitive mechanism that people use to make inferences and learn new abstractions . The history of work on analogy in modern cognitive science is sketched , focusing on contributions from cognitive psy - chology , artificial intelligence , and philosophy of science . This review sets the stage for the 3 articles that follow in this Science Watch section . p eople live in a world of perpetual novelty , in which no experience is ever exactly repeated . Yet para - doxically , many would agree that there is nothing new under the sun . " The " illusion of familiarity , " as it might be called , depends on the power of the human mind to find - - and , if necessary , to create - - similarities between past experiences and the present situation . Per - ceived similarities enable one to organize objects and events into familiar categories - - cats and dogs , friend - ships and love affairs . But how do categories first get formed ? One basic mechanism is analogy - - the process of understanding a novel situation in terms of one that is already familiar . The familiar situation - - often termed the base or source analog - - provides a kind of model for making inferences about the unfamiliar situation - - the target analog . In the course of reasoning by analogy , the novel target comes to be seen as another example of " the same kind of thing " as the familiar analog . And the analogy between two specific situations may provide the " seed " for learning a more general category or schema that encompasses both . The power of analogy to create similarities makes it a tool for a wide range of purposes , including solving problems , constructing explanations , and building argu - ments . Consider an example from recent history ( Spell - man & Holyoak , 1992 ) . In order to muster support for the U . S . - led drive to liberate Kuwait after it was captured by Iraq , President George Bush explicitly compared Sad - dam Hussein to Adolf Hitler and the Persian Gulf crisis to events that led to World War II a half century earlier . By drawing the analogy between Saddam Hussein and Hitler , President Bush encouraged a reasoning process that led to the construction of a coherent system of roles for the players in the Gulf situation . Once the analogical Northwestern University University of California , Los Angeles correspondences were established ( with Iraq identified as an expansionist dictatorship like Germany , Kuwait as its first victim , Saudi Arabia as the next potential victim , and the United States as the main defender of the Gulf states ) , the clear analogical inference was that both self - interest and moral considerations required immediate military intervention by the United States . How does analogy actually operate ? How is it con - nected with judgments of similarity ? What roles does it play in everyday reasoning and decision making ? Can an understanding of analogy provide insights of use to clini - cal psychologists and educators ? This section of Science Watch features three articles that address these questions . These articles provide distinct but interrelated perspec - tives on a research topic that over the past two decades has been a major " success story " in the interdisciplinary field of cognitive science . The progress in understanding analogy is manifested in several ways . First , the study of analogy has been energized by fruitful collaborations between researchers in psychology and artificial intelli - gence , with significant influences from philosophy , lin - guistics , and history of science . Second , the empirical and computational work has led to a substantial degree of convergence between researchers in the field , indicat - ing the stability of many of the fundamental theoretical assumptions . Finally , theories of analogy have been ex - tended to account for data in areas that are near relatives , such as metaphor and mundane similarity , as well as to Editor ' s note . Lyle E .

Modern views of analogy can be traced to such pioneering influences as the philosopher Mary Hesse ( 1966 ) , whose treatise on analogy in science argued that analogies are powerful forces in discovery and concep - tual change . For some time , howevel ; most psychological work on analogy focused on four - term analogy problems of the sort used in intelligence tests ( e . g . , " foot is to leg as arm is to what ? " ) rather than on the richer analogies used in science and everyday life . In the early 1980s , two research projects in psychology began to take a broader view of analogy . Gentner ( 1982 , 1983 ; Gentner & Gent - ner , 1983 ) began working on mental models and analogy in science . She was struck by the idea that in analogy , the key similarities lie in the relations that hold within the domains ( e . g . , the flow of electrons in an electrical circuit is analogically similar to the flow of people in a crowded subway tunnel ) rather than in features of indi - vidual objects ( e . g . , electrons do not resemble people ) . Moreover , analogical similarities often depend on higher order relations - - relations between relations . For exam - ple , adding a resistor to a circuit causes ( a higher order relation ) a decrease in the flow of electricity , just as adding a narrow gate in a subway tunnel would decrease the rate at which people could pass through . In her struc - ture - mapping theory , Gentner set forth the view that anal - ogy entails finding a structural alignment , or a mapping , between domains . This alignment between two represen - tational structures is characterized by structural parallel - ism ( consistent , one - to - one correspondences between mapped elements ) and systematicity - - an implicit prefer - ence for deep , interconnected systems of relations gov - erned by higher order relations , such as causal , mathemat - ical , or functional relations . Holyoak ( 1985 ; Gick & Holyoak , 1980 , 1983 ; Holy - oak & Koh , 1987 ) became convinced that analogy offered a richer approach to problem solving than those that were then available . His focus on problem solving led him to a strong concern for the role of pragmatics in analogy - - how current goals and context guide the interpretation of an analogy . Holyoak and Thagard ( 1989 ) developed a multiconstraint approach to analogy in which similarity , structural parallelism , and pragmatic factors interact to produce an interpretation . In addition , Holyoak ' s re - search on problem solving provided evidence that anal - ogy can provide the seed for forming new relational cate - gories , by abstracting the relational correspondences be - tween examples into a schema for a class of problems . Analogy was viewed as a central part of human induction ( Holland , Holyoak , Nisbett , & Thagard , 1986 ) . At the same time , researchers in artificial intelli - gence began to grapple with the use of complex analogies in reasoning and learning ( Winston , 1980 ) . Schank and his colleagues were exploring the role of experience in understanding ( Schank , 1982 ) and the relationship be - tween understanding , learning , and memory ( Kolodner , 1983 ) . This exploration soon led to a more general focus on the role of experience in reasoning and the relation - ships among reasoning , learning , and memory . Case - based reasoning ( e . g . , Kolodner , 1993 ; Kolodner & Simpson , 1989 ; Schank , Kass , & Riesbeck , 1994 ) was born from these explorations as a methodology for com - puter reasoning and as a plausible model of human rea - somng . In contrast to rule - based approaches to reasoning ( the dominant approach in artificial intelligence at the time ) , case - based reasoning emphasized the usefulness of retrieving and adapting cases or analogs stored in long - term memory when deriving solutions to novel problems . During recent years , the efforts of many cognitive scientists have contributed to an emerging consensus on many issues concerning analogy ( e . g . , Halford , 1993 ; Keane , Ledgeway , & Duff , 1994 ; Ross , 1989 ) . The pro - cess of analogical thinking can be usefully decomposed into several basic constituent processes . One or more relevant analogs stored in memory must be accessed . A familiar analog must be mapped to the target analog to identify systematic correspondences between the two , thereby aligning the corresponding parts of each analog . The resulting mapping allows analogical inferences to be made about the target analog , thus creating new knowl - edge to fill gaps in understanding . These inferences need to be evaluated and possibly adapted to fit the unique requirements of the target . Finally , in the aftermath of analogical reasoning , learning can result in the generation of new categories and schemas , the addition of new in - stances to memory , and new understandings of old in - stances and schemas that allow them to be better accessed in the future . All current theories of analogy deal with some sub - set of these basic component processes . In various ways and with differing emphases , all these theories make use of some combination of structural information about the form of the analogs and pragmatic information about the goals that triggered the reasoning episode . Theories of analogy have been instantiated in computer simulations . The output of a simulation can be compared to human performance with analogies , providing empirical ground - ing for the theoretical principles underlying the computer model . The three articles that follow illustrate some of the current research and theories of analogy use . Each article emphasizes particular issues and approaches . Holyoak and Thagard ( 1997 ) provide a number of examples of how analogies are used in contexts ranging from political debate to psychotherapy . They discuss these examples in terms of their multiconstraint theory , which posits a small number of basic principles that interact to guide analogi - cal mapping and other aspects of analogy use . Gentner and Markman ( 1997 ) describe the structure - mapping the - ory , which emphasizes the structural principles on which mapping is based . They show how the structure - mapping theory provides insights into how similarities can be ac - tively created as two analogs are aligned with one another . Kolodner ( 1997 ) provides an overview of the case - based reasoning approach as it applies to human and artificial intelligence and discusses some of its implications for design of educational practices and educational software . January 1997 â€¢ American Psychologist 33 Whereas the first two articles emphasize work on the mapping process , Kolodner ' s article focuses on how cases are retrieved and adapted . Each article sketches some of the computer simulations that have been devel - oped to test theories of analogy and also raises some unanswered questions that invite further research .
