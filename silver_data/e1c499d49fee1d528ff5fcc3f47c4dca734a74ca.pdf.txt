Upon implantation , pluripotent cells form a columnar epithelium and undergo lumenogenesis . At gastrulation , a portion of the pluripotent epiblast will undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , forming the primitive streak ( PS ) . It still remains unclear what molecular mechanism supports the epithelial identity of the pluripotent epiblast before gastrulation . Here we developed an optimised , chemically defined 3D model of human pluripotent epiblast formation in which conventional pluripotent stem cells ( PSCs ) self - organise into a columnar epithelium with a lumen in 48 hours . From 72 hours we observed spontaneous symmetry breaking and specification of PS - like cells , as confirmed by single - cell RNA sequencing . We found that Insulin and FGF signalling are both required for the proliferation and survival of the pluripotent epiblast model . Conversely , TGF - beta signalling maintains epithelial identity . Epithelial identity appears uncoupled from the expression of canonical pluripotency markers OCT4 , NANOG and PRDM14 , but under the control of ZNF398 . Once the pluripotent epithelium is established , TGF - beta inhibition is inconsequential , and stimulation with Activin A leads to highly efficient PS induction . We conclude that TGF - beta dynamically orchestrates epithelial identity of human pluripotent cells . Introduction Pluripotency is the potential to give rise to all cell types of the adult body and , during development , is first observed in the inner cell mass ( ICM ) of the pre - implantation blastocyst . The ICM segregates into pre - implantation naive epiblast cells , which retain pluripotency , and hypoblast , or primitive endoderm cells , which will give rise to extraembryonic cells of the parietal and visceral endoderm and tissues like the yolk sack 1 – 4 . A second population of the pre - implantation blastocyst , the trophectoderm , will give rise to cytotrophoblast , which is crucial for embryo implantation . At the time of implantation , epiblast cells polarise into rosettes leading to the formation of a lumen , which will expand into the future amniotic cavity . The epiblast forms a polarised columnar epithelium , with the apical side facing the amniotic cavity . The epithelial identity of the epiblast is then maintained until the gastrulation stage , as the formation of the primitive streak ( PS ) entails a transition from epithelial to mesenchymal identity and loss of pluripotency 5 . It still remains unclear whether epithelial identity and pluripotency of the post - implantation epiblast are tightly coupled and whether one affects the other . It is also unclear what signals induce and maintain the epithelial identity in the post - implantation epiblast . The Zernicka - Goetz laboratory reported a critical role for the basal membrane , or basement membrane , produced by the primitive and visceral endoderm and required for the polarization and maturation of the mouse epiblast epithelium 6 . Moreover , remodelling of the basement membrane allows , in mouse embryos , for the expansion of the PS 7 . However , the requirement for a basement membrane does not rule out the presence of instructive signals in this context , in particular in the case of the human post - implantation epiblast , which is understudied for both technical and ethical reasons . Conventional human pluripotent stem cells ( PSCs ) are either derived from human embryos as Embryonic Stem Cells ( ESCs ) 8 , or via reprogramming of somatic cells as induced Pluripotent Stem Cells ( iPSCs ) 9 , 10 . Conventional human PSCs are cultured as 2D monolayers and are molecularly close to the post - implantation epiblast 11 . They have been extensively used to study the molecular circuitries controlling the maintenance of pluripotency and their differentiation towards germ layers . Transcription factors including POU5F1 / OCT4 , SOX2 , NANOG , PRDM14 and ZNF398 , are either required or sufficient to maintain human pluripotency in PSCs 12 – 14 . These transcription factors cross - regulate each other , forming a network that is stabilised by signalling via the canonical TGF - beta , FGF and Insulin pathways 13 , 15 – 21 . Culture of PSCs in a 2D monolayer however does not capture the spatial constraints and cell - cell dynamics of the early embryo . To overcome such limitations several 3D models of the human post - implantation embryo have been reported 22 – 26 , 26 – 32 . These are useful tools for the study of cell - cell communication and self - organisation , which advanced our understanding of some developmental processes . For example , it has been shown that lumenogenesis of the epiblast is controlled by actin cytoskeleton 33 , that amnion specification occurs in response to BMP 22 , 23 , 31 , 32 , 34 , and that the production of the basement membrane of hypoblast cells is induced by TGF - beta ligands 27 . Across these models , there is a clear trade - off between the complexity ( i . e . number of cell types generated ) and the efficiency / reproducibility ( e . g . fraction of structures correctly organised ) . Moreover , the presence of multiple cell types and the use of undefined reagents ( i . e . conditioned medium , foetal serum or KO serum replacement ) might represent a hurdle to identifying the molecules controlling a process of interest . For these reasons , we optimised a minimal model of the post - implantation epiblast . Under chemically defined conditions , conventional PSCs undergo lumenogenesis and form a polarised columnar epithelium . Epithelial identity is then maintained until a symmetry - breaking event occurs , in which mesenchymal TBXT + cells are formed . Single - cell RNA sequencing ( scRNAseq ) confirmed the acquisition of post - implantation epiblast and PS identities . TGF - beta signalling is crucial during the initial 48 hours for the establishment of epithelial identity , which appears uncoupled from the expression of pluripotency OCT4 , NANOG and PRDM14 , but under the control of ZNF398 . Once the pluripotent epithelium is established , TGF - beta inhibition is inconsequential , while stimulation with the TGF - beta ligand Activin A alone leads to efficient mesoderm induction . We conclude that TGF - beta dynamically orchestrates the epithelial identity of post - implantation pluripotent cells . Results Efficient generation of a 3D in vitro minimal model of epiblast - like structures resembling post - implantation epiblast and primitive streak . After implantation , epiblast cells self - organise in a columnar epithelium that undergoes lumenogenesis , while maintaining pluripotency . It is possible to recapitulate these processes in vitro by surrounding hPSCs in an extracellular matrix mimicking the basement membrane 29 , 32 , 34 – 37 . With the aim of studying the mechanisms controlling the epithelial identity of the epiblast , we optimised a chemically defined 3D epiblast model . We first analysed scRNAseq data of human embryos asking what signals the post - implantation epiblast might be responsive to ( Extended Data Fig . 1a - b ) . All 4 FGF receptors ( FGFR1 / 2 / 3 / 4 ) , Insulin and IGF1 / 2 receptors , TGF - beta ( TGFBR1 / 2 / 3 ) and Nodal / Activin receptors ( ACVR2A / B ) were highly expressed in the post - implantation epiblast . Moreover , the ligands FGF2 , FGF4 , NODAL and TGF - beta 1 were expressed by the post - implantation epiblast ; NODAL and IGF1 were highly expressed in the hypoblast , while TGF - beta 1 , Activin A and IGF2 were highly expressed by cytotrophoblast cells ( Extended Data Fig . 1a - b ) . We conclude that in the post - implantation epiblast , the TGF - beta , FGF and Insulin / IGF pathways could be active , thus we decided to use a chemically defined medium ( E8 ) , which contains ligands of these 3 pathways . We plated a suspension of single hPSCs on top of a layer of growth factor - reduced Matrigel ( GFRM ) in E8 medium containing 5 % GFRM ( Extended Data Fig . 1c ) . By optimising the number of cells plated , we observed the efficient formation of cell aggregates that after 2 days started to form a lumen and at day 4 appeared as large cysts composed of a columnar epithelium ( Fig . 1a ) . From 50 , 000 single cells seeded we obtained 11652 + / - 1400 cysts at day 4 , and > 95 % displayed the correct formation of a lumen and epithelial organisation ( Fig . 1b ) . The cysts displayed apical accumulation of F - actin and basal nuclei , as reported 29 , 32 – 34 , 36 . Up to day 4 the cysts maintained expression of pluripotency markers NANOG , OCT4 and ZNF398 at levels higher than those of conventional hPSCs in 2D ( Fig . 1c , Extended Data Fig . 1d ) . Pluripotent cells of the epiblast form the PS , a migratory cell population of the human embryo , transiently expressing TBXT ( also known as T or BRACHYURY ) , GATA6 , MIXL1 and EOMES 22 , 40 , 41 ultimately giving rise to the mesoderm and endoderm germ layers . We observed robust expression of several PS / mesoderm markers from day 4 onwards ( Fig . 1c and Extended Data Fig . 1e ) , with TBXT + cells forming clusters ( Fig . 1d ) . These results were unexpected , given that we did not provide exogenous BMP or WNT ligands , which induce PS in several human in vitro models 22 , 23 , 27 , 29 , 32 , 37 . RNAseq analysis revealed an elevated expression of the ligands WNTA3 / 5A and BMP2 / 4 / 7 , and of their respective target genes AXIN1 and ID1 / 2 / 3 in day 4 cysts ( Extended Data Fig . 1f ) . These results indicate that autocrine WNT and BMP signalling might be responsible for the induction of PS genes . Next , we performed scRNAseq 42 to determine the identity of individual cells forming cystic structures . We analysed the PSCs cultured in 2D used to form 3D structures ( day 0 ) and structures collected at day 2 , 4 and 6 ( Extended Data Fig . 2a , left ) . We identified 6 clusters ( Extended Data Fig . 2a , right ) . Clusters A , B , C and D expressed high levels of pluripotency and epithelial / polarity markers , while cluster E expressed PS markers . Cluster F comprised only cells from day 0 and day 2 ( Extended Data Fig . 2b ) , which expressed only SOX2 , but no other pluripotency or PS markers ( Extended Data Fig . 2c ) . We conclude that these cells underwent rapid spontaneous differentiation , they failed to maintain any defined cell identity , and thus we excluded them from further analyses . Next , we integrated our scRNAseq data with data from human embryos 41 . We identified 10 clusters ( Fig . 1e ) , most of which corresponded to the different cell types previously annotated by Xiang and colleagues ( Fig . 1f ) . For example , cluster 5 ( Fig . 1e ) corresponded to ICM cells ( Fig . 1f ) . Interestingly , cluster 7 comprised both cells from the early PS of the embryo and cells from our in vitro model ( Fig . 1f - g ) . Cluster 7 displayed elevated expression of PS markers GATA6 , MIXL1 , EOMES , VIM and CDH2 ( also known as NCAD or N - Cadherin ) 22 , 27 , 40 , 41 ( Fig . 1h and Extended Data Fig . 2d ) . We conclude that our cystic structures contain cells transcriptionally compatible with PS identity . Clusters 2 and 3 contained mostly cells of the post - implantation epiblast ( Post . EPI ) and cells from cysts ( Fig . 1i ) . Cells in clusters 2 and 3 did not express markers of ICM ( ESRRB 41 ) and Preimplantation Epiblast ( TFCP2L1 and KLF17 41 , 43 , 44 ) , nor PS markers , while they did express high levels of general pluripotency ( POU5F1 , SOX2 , PRDM14 and ZNF398 ) and polarity / epithelial markers ( CLDN6 / 7 and PODXL ) which have been detected in the post - implantation epiblast 27 , 32 , 36 ( Fig . 1h and Extended Data Fig . 2e - f ) . These analyses indicate that our in vitro model contains cells transcriptionally compatible with Post - implantation epiblast identity . Finally , cluster 1 of this integrated analysis was entirely composed of cells from our in vitro model ( Fig . 1i ) . Thanks to the integrated analysis we were able to classify the different populations of our 3D model . Cluster A of our in vitro model was composed mainly of PSCs at day 0 ( Extended Data Fig . 2b ) , thus named ‘PSC _ 2D’ . Cluster E was the main contributor to cluster 7 of the integrated analyses ( Fig . 1i ) , therefore it was named ‘PS - Like’ . Indeed , cluster E displayed a loss of CDH1 expression , a hallmark of PS formation 5 , 25 . Cluster D contained cells mostly from day 6 ( Extended Data Fig . 2b ) and was the major contributor to clusters 2 and 3 of the integrated analyses ( Fig . 1i , red ) , therefore it was named ‘PostEpi - Like’ . Two clusters ( B and C ) were mostly composed of cells at day 2 , transitioning from PSC in 2D to the PS - like and PostEpi - like states ( ‘Transition1’ in yellow , ‘Transition2’ in orange ) . We then performed pseudotime analysis of the in vitro differentiation trajectories and found that pluripotency and epithelial / polarity markers increased in expression going from PSC _ 2D to Transient1 / 2 , peaking in the PostEpi - like cluster ( Fig . 1j - k and Extended Data Fig . 2g ) . Transition from PSC _ 2D to PS - like was characterised by a sharp increase in PS markers . We concluded that our chemically - defined protocol efficiently gives rise to 3D structures that undergo luminogenesis , form a columnar epithelium with Post - implantation epiblast transcriptional identity , eventually specifying PS - like cells . Based on naming conventions recently proposed 45 , we named our model 3D - hE - gastruloids . TGF - beta is required for epithelialisation of 3D - hE - gastruloids Our 3D minimal model recapitulates lumenogenesis , formation of a pluripotent epithelium and specification of PS - like cells in the absence of extraembryonic cells , under chemically - defined conditions , thus representing an ideal setting to identify the signalling pathways controlling these processes . We functionally tested the three main signalling pathways ( Insulin , FGF and TGF - beta ) activated by our chemically - defined medium ( Extended Data Fig . 1a - c ) . First , we plated hPSCs in absence of Insulin and observed widespread cell death , indicating that Insulin is required for cell survival ( Fig . 2a ) . FGF ligands are produced by the epiblast itself ( Extended Data Fig . 1b ) and also in our 3D structures , thus we tested FGF function by withdrawing from the medium and adding the FGF Receptor inhibitor PD173074 ( PD17 ) . We observed reduced size in otherwise correctly formed structures at low doses ( Fig . 2a ) , and decreased survival at higher doses , indicating that FGF induces proliferation and survival , as recently reported for in vitro cultured human embryos 43 . In the case of TGF - beta , withdrawal of the ligand and blockade of TGF - beta signalling with two independent inhibitors , SB431542 ( SB43 ) and A83 - 01 ( A83 ) had similar effects on self – organisation , without impacting survival ( Fig . 2a and Extended Data Fig . 3a - b ) . While control structures displayed basal nuclei , sharp apical F - actin domain and columnar shape ( Fig . 2b - c ) , TGF - beta inhibition caused a shift in the nuclei position , loss of a defined apical F - actin domain and an irregular shape . Transcriptome analyses revealed a reduction of epithelial markers CDH1 , ESRP1 and EPCAM , with an increase in mesenchymal markers CDH2 , S100A4 and VIMENTIN ( Fig . 2d ) . Furthermore , a fraction of 3D - hE - gastruloids failed to form a cavity , indicating a partial impairment of lumenogenesis ( Fig . 2a and Extended Data Fig . 3a - b ) . These results indicate that TGF - beta signalling is required to maintain pluripotent cells as a polarised columnar epithelium . Of note , TGF - beta inhibition led also to downregulation of key pluripotency markers ( Fig . 2d ) , indicating that TGF - beta signalling maintains pluripotency , in agreement with previous studies in 3D and 2D models 13 , 19 , 20 , 31 , 46 . Next , we asked when TGF - beta signalling is needed for the correct formation of 3D - hE - gastruloids ( Fig . 2e - f and Extended Data Fig . 3c - e ) . We observed that inhibition of TGF - beta starting at the time of plating single cells ( day 0 ) or at day 1 strongly impaired self - organisation , but was inconsequential if it started at day 2 or 3 ( Fig . 2e - f and Extended Data Fig . 3c - e ) . Consistently , the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers was affected only when TGF - beta was inhibited from day 0 or day 1 ( Fig . 2g and Extended Data Fig . 3f ) . Interestingly , pluripotency markers were strongly downregulated even when TGF - beta was inhibited at day 3 ( Fig . 2h and Extended Data Fig . 3g ) . We conclude that maintenance of epithelial identity requires TGF - beta signalling only during the first 2 days , whilst expression of pluripotency markers requires constant TGF - beta stimulation . TGF - beta promotes the self - organisation of murine PSCs Ligands of TGF - beta , like Nodal are highly expressed at the time of implantation in murine embryos , when the epiblast acquires polarity and epithelial identity , forming a rosette and then a lumen . We therefore hypothesised that TGF - beta might also promote the formation and organisation of a pluripotent epiblast epithelium in the mouse . To test this hypothesis we used two in vitro model systems . First , we used mouse naive ESCs , embedded in GFRM in the presence of the basal medium N2B27 . These conditions lead to the formation of rosette structures after 96 hours , with basal nuclei and apical accumulation of F - actin 47 – 49 ( Fig . 3a - b ) . Inhibition of TGF - beta throughout the process led to the formation of structures in which the epithelial organisation was lost and cavity formation was impaired in ~ 30 % of the cases ( Fig . 3c ) . Pou5f1 , also known as Oct4 , is highly expressed in rosettes , like in the peri - implantation embryo 50 , and its expression is reduced by TGF - beta inhibition ( Fig . 3d ) . Second , we combined wild - type mouse ESCs with inducible - Gata4 ESCs in the absence of exogenous extracellular matrix proteins . This system has been shown to self - organise into structures with an inner epiblast - like layer of pluripotent , OCT4 positive cells , surrounded by a layer of visceral endoderm ( VE ) - like cells 51 ( Fig . 3e - f ) . Accumulation of F - actin and Podocalyxin strongly marks VE - like cells as well as the lumen - facing , apical side of the epiblast - like cells ( Fig . 3f ) . Inhibition of TGF - beta completely ablated lumen formation and epithelial organisation . F - actin and Podocalyxin staining was retained only by VE - like cells , but was not detected in the core of the structures , indicating impaired polarisation . The expression of Oct4 was dramatically reduced both at the protein and mRNA levels . We conclude that TGF - beta is required for the correct organisation of a pluripotent epithelium and for maintenance of the pluripotency marker Oct4 , as also observed in our human PSC - based model . ZNF398 promotes epithelial identity downstream of TGF - beta We previously reported that ZNF398 induces pluripotency and epithelial identity downstream of the TGF - beta pathway in hPSCs in 2D 13 , thus we wondered whether it could also play a role during the self - organisation of hPSCs in 3D . We first measured the levels of ZNF398 in 3D and observed a strong reduction in the presence of SB43 , indicating that TGF - beta maintains ZNF398 expression ( Fig . 4a and Extended Data Fig . 4a , blue and yellow bars ) . SB43 also blocked the organisation of 3D - hE - gastruloids ( Fig . 2 and 4b - c ) , causing a reduction of epithelial markers and an increase in mesenchymal ones ( Fig . 4d and Extended Data Fig . 4a ) . We checked the expression of the TGF - beta targets ( LEFTY1 , LEFTY2 ) and confirmed robust inhibition of TGF - beta signalling by SB43 in both cell lines ( Fig . 4e ) . We conclude that reduced levels of ZNF398 are correlated with loss of epithelial identity in 3D . To test whether ZNF398 is actively controlling epithelial identity , we generated hPSCs expressing ZNF398 at ~ endogenous levels ( Fig . 4a and Extended Data Fig . 4a , lilac bars ) . We observed formation of correctly epithelialized 3D - hE - gastruloids in the ZNF398 expressing cell line both in the absence and in the presence of SB43 ( Fig . 4b - c ) . Epithelial markers were highly induced while mesenchymal markers were kept at low levels by ZNF398 forced expression ( Fig . 4d and Extended Data Fig . 4a ) , indicating that ZNF398 is epistatic to TGF - beta signalling . Analysis of a large set of human pluripotency markers ( Fig . 4f and Extended Data Fig . 4b ) revealed that ZNF398 did not maintain their expression in presence of SB43 , indicating that induction of epithelial genes by ZNF398 does not require the presence of other pluripotency factors . We conclude that ZNF398 is sufficient to maintain the epithelial identity in 3D - hE - gastruloids , acting downstream of TGF - beta ( Fig . 4g ) . Activin boosts the primitive streak differentiation in the 3D structures Our results indicate that TGF - beta signalling is required during the first 2 days of formation of 3D structures to acquire a stable epithelial identity ( Fig . 2e - g and Extended Data Fig . 3d - g ) . However , TGF - beta signalling is also known to induce PS and mesendoderm specification in several model systems , including human PSCs . Given that PS formation requires acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype , it might appear as if TGF - beta promotes , counterintuitively , both epithelial and mesenchymal identities . We reasoned that these two processes are temporally separated during development , as the epiblast forms a columnar epithelium at the time of implantation , while a subset of epiblast cells undergo EMT and form a PS later , at gastrulation . Given that 3D - hE - gastruloids recapitulate both processes , we decided to exploit it to study TGF - beta responsiveness at different times . As PS - like cells of 3D - hE - gastruloids expressed MIXL1 ( Fig . 1k and Extended Data Fig . 2c ) , we employed a MIXL1 - GFP HES3 reporter hESC line . We allowed for the acquisition of epithelial identity in E8 for 2 days ( Fig . 5a ) . On day 2 , structures were either kept in E8 or exposed to the basal medium E6 , which lacks FGF2 and TGFB1 . Both conditions led to a similar induction of MIXL1 , GATA6 and TBXT mRNAs and of the GFP reporter ( Fig . 5b - c ) . We concluded that FGF2 and TGFB1 do not play a role in PS - like cell induction . Activin A is a TGF - beta ligand commonly used to induce PS and mesendoderm from hPSCs , in combination with BMP and FGF ligands and LY294002 ( LY ) , an inhibitor of Phosphatidylinositol 3 - Kinase 18 , 52 – 54 . Exposure to the 4 signalling molecules led to upregulation of PS markers and complete switch to a mesenchymal morphology ( Fig . 5b - c ) . We then tested the contribution of each signalling molecule and surprisingly the sole stimulation with Activin A was sufficient to strongly induce PS - like cells , while the BMP , FGF and LY had no effect . We quantified the activity of MIXL1 - GFP reporter by flow cytometry and observed strong induction in > 60 % of cells in the presence of Activin A ( Fig . 5d ) . Several previous studies reported that activation of the TGF - beta pathway is not sufficient to induce PS / mesoderm in human PSCs in 2D 18 , 53 , 55 , 56 , in stark contrast with our 3D results . We performed side - by - side experiments in which MIXL1 - GFP hESCs were plated on the same substrate ( GFRM ) in either 2D or 3D , and then subjected to identical signalling environment ( E8 for 2 days followed by E6 + Activin A for 3 days ) . Crucially , we confirmed that PSCs in 2D failed to induce MIXL1 or GATA6 , while in 3D we observed some spontaneous activation in E6 that was maximised by Activin A treatment ( Fig . 5e - g ) . In sum , we conclude that 3D - hE - gastruloids , once allowed to self - organise for 2 days into a polarised epithelium , are highly responsive to Activin A stimulation for induction of PS - like cells . Discussion Pluripotent cells of the epiblast acquire epithelial identity at the time of implantation and maintain it for several days . What factors are required for epithelial identity of pluripotent cells ? Are pluripotency and epithelial identity of the epiblast coupled , or can one exist without the other ? A basement membrane is structurally required by all epithelia , indeed in vitro models of 3D epiblasts contain either substrates mimicking a basement membrane or hypoblast cells that surround epiblast cells and produce components of the basement membrane 6 , 22 , 23 , 26 , 27 , 29 , 31 – 36 , 57 . However , our results indicate that additional instructive cues are needed , as hPSCs cannot form a correctly organised epiblast epithelium in the absence of TGF - beta signalling , even though a basement membrane is provided . Thus TGF - beta actively stabilises epithelial identity , as we previously reported for hPSCs in 2D 13 . Interestingly , 2 days of TGF - beta signal are sufficient to stabilise the epithelial identity . In contrast , the expression of key pluripotency factors OCT4 , SOX2 , NANOG and PRDM14 requires constant TGF - beta stimulation . If TGF - beta signal is present only for the first 2 days , we obtained structures with full epithelial character that lost expression of pluripotency markers . In other words , the epithelial identity is maintained for several days even in the absence of key pluripotency factors . We also observed that ZNF398 is sufficient to induce epithelial identity downstream of TGF - beta . Indeed , hPSCs stably expressing a ZNF398 transgene can form , in the absence of TGF - beta , 3D structures with stable epithelial identity , while key pluripotency factors are not expressed . Based on these observations we conclude that epithelial identity and pluripotency are two separate , uncoupled processes , as cells can lose pluripotency while maintaining their epithelial character . In the gastrulating embryo , some epiblast cells form the PS and lose both epithelial identity and pluripotency . However , epiblast cells not contributing to the PS will default towards ectoderm lineage , losing pluripotency while maintaining epithelial identity , indicating that also during embryonic development the two processes are uncoupled . Epithelial identity appears to be stable once established , unless an external cue induces an EMT . Conversely , pluripotency needs constant support by external cues . These two behaviours underlie different needs of the developing embryo : pluripotency is an intrinsically unstable state that should be rapidly extinguished upon germ layer specification , while epithelial identity is found in several tissues and should be maintained throughout development and in the adult . TGF - beta signalling is known to induce EMT 58 and PS , as we also observed in our model . How can the same signalling pathway stabilise epithelial identity and induce EMT in the same system ? First , we observed a temporal gap of 2 days between the two responses . The fact that the same signal might exert opposite functions has precedents during embryonic development , as WNT signalling switches from a posteriorising to an anteriorising signal during frog development in less than 24 hours 59 . Second , we observed that TGFB1 ligand promotes epithelial character but does not affect PS and EMT induction , while Activin A strongly promotes PS and loss of epithelial identity . Although TGFB1 and Activin A should activate the same downstream mediators ( i . e . SMAD2 and SMAD3 ) , they might do so with different intensities and durations . For instance , the Siggia and Brivanlou laboratories showed in human 2D gastruloids , in which PSCs form spatially defined territories of embryonic and extraembryonic cell populations in response to extracellular cues 60 , that a transient SMAD2 activation is sufficient to induce pluripotency genes , while a more prolonged activation is needed for mesendodermal differentiation 46 . Third , SMAD2 / 3 can interact with different transcription factors in a stage - dependent manner , like OCT4 in PSCs and FOXH1 in mesodermal precursors 61 , resulting in the regulation of different transcriptional programs . We observed a strongly increased responsiveness to Activin A in 3D conditions compared to 2D , in terms of induction of PS / mesoderm . Also in a microfluidics - based 3D epiblast model 32 Activin A was sufficient to induce PS - like cells , while in several 2D models different TGF - beta ligands failed to do so 18 , 46 , 53 , 55 , 56 . 2D models do not recapitulate the 3D spatial organisation of the embryo ( e . g . formation of lumen ) and display some features that may not be observed in vivo . For example , receptors of the TGF - beta pathway are basolateral localised in PSCs and in the epiblast . By culturing PSCs in 2D , the edge of a colony is more responsive to TGF - beta ligands 46 , 60 , while in the embryo the basal side of the whole epiblast epithelium is in contact with a source of TGF - beta , the hypoblast . Therefore we would speculate that in 3D epiblast models , the basolateral receptors are more exposed to external signals than under 2D conditions , potentially explaining the increased responsiveness . Future studies will be needed to test the responsiveness and signalling dynamics in 2D vs 3D conditions . From a purely technical perspective , 3D - hE - gastruloids offer several advantages , as they model epithelial formation , lumenogenesis and primitive streak induction under chemically defined conditions . The absence of extraembryonic cell populations overcomes potential ethical limitations . The assay does not require bio - engineerging devices , but only commercially available reagents , thus favouring reproducibility . Finally , its high efficiency and throughput makes it ideal for the dissection of molecular mechanisms and for global analyses like metabolomics and proteomics . In conclusion , 3D - hE - gastruloids recapitulate several aspects of post - implantation epiblast development , despite the absence of extraembryonic cells , indicating that a basement membrane and the triple stimulation of FGF , Insulin and TGF - beta pathways are the minimal requirements to consolidate post - implantation epiblast identity and to kickstart PS induction .

METHOD DETAILS Cell Culture Human primed hiPSCs ( KiPS 13 , 62 , Keratinocytes induced Pluripotent Stem Cells ) and hESCs ( H9 and HES3 - MIXL1 - GFP 63 ) were cultured in Feeder - free on pre - coated plates with 0 . 5 % growth factor - reduced Matrigel ( CORNING 356231 ) ( vol / vol in PBS with MgCl2 / CaCl2 , Sigma - Aldrich D8662 ) in E8 medium ( made in - house according to 39 ) at 37°C , 5 % CO 2 , 5 % O 2 . Cells were passaged every 3 - 4 days at a split ratio of 1 : 8 following dissociation with 0 . 5 mM EDTA ( Invitrogen AM99260G ) in PBS without MgCl2 / CaCl2 ( Sigma - Aldrich D8662 ) , pH8 . The H9 line ( WA09 ) was obtained from and used under authorisation from WiCell Research Institute . The HES3 - MIXL1 - GFP line was generated by gene targeting 63 and kindly provided by Prof . Andrew Elefanty . KiPS line was derived by reprogramming of commercial human keratinocytes ( Invitrogen ) with Sendai viruses encoding for OSKM 62 and kindly provided by Austin Smith ' s laboratory . All cell lines were mycoplasma - negative ( Mycoalert , Lonza ) . Formation of 3D - hE - gastruloids hPSCs were detached as single cells using TrypLE TM Select ( 1X ) ( Thermo Fisher 12563 - 029 ) . A well of a Chamber slide was covered ( Thermo scientific 177402 , 0 . 8 cm 2 each ) with 40µl of pure ice - cold growth factor reduced Matrigel ( CORNING Cat . 356231 ) and incubated for 2 minutes ( min ) at 37°C to allow Matrigel to solidify . 50 , 000 cells ( for each well of a chamber slide ) were resuspended in 250μl of E8 medium with 10µM ROCKi . 10 min after plating , the medium was removed and replaced with 250µl of E8 + 10µM ROCKi containing 5 % Matrigel . After 24 hours , the medium was changed ( E8 medium containing 5 % of Matrigel v / v ) . The 3D structures were grown at 37°C , 5 % CO 2 , 21 % O 2 . For the experiments in which we functionally tested the three main signalling pathways , we treated the 3D structures from day 0 with ( E8 or E8 plus DMSO ) or without insulin ( E8 - insulin ) , or without FGF in the E8 medium , plus PD173074 ( 10nM or 50nM ) , or without TGF - beta in the E8 medium plus SB431542 at the indicated concentrations ( 1 µM , 2 . 5µM , 5µM or 10 µM ) , or without TGF - beta in the E8 medium plus A83 - 01 at the indicated concentrations ( 1 µM , 2 . 5µM , 5µM or 10 µM ) . For the time course experiments , we treated the 3D structures with SB43 or A83 at the indicated time points ( day 0 , day 1 , day 2 , day3 ) for 4 days . For the experiments with MIXL1 - GFP HES3 reporter cells , after 2 days in E8 media , the media was changed with E8 or in the indicated conditions ( E6 , E6 + BMP + FGF + LY + Activin , E6 + BMP , E6 + FGF , E6 + LY , E6 + Activin ) . Formation of cysts To prepare the AggreWell plate ( STEMCELL Technologies 34415 ) , 500ml of anti - adherence rinsing solution ( STEMCELL Technologies 07010 ) was added to each well . The plate was then centrifuged at 1 , 000 x g for 5 minutes and incubated at room temperature until cells were ready for seeding . Rinsing solution was then aspirated and each well was washed with 1 mL of PBS . PBS was then aspirated and 500 uL of FC media were added to each well . To prepare ESCs for generating cysts , Doxycycline ( 1 mg / mL ) ( Sigma - Aldrich D9891 - 5G ) was added to CAG - GFP tetO - Gata4 ESCs 6 hours prior to plating in AggreWell . Both CAG - GFP tetO - Gata4 and E14 ESCs were washed once with 1x PBS , and dissociated with Accutase for 4 minutes at 37 °C . The reaction was stopped by adding 2 mL of feeder cell medium ( FC , see below ) . Cells were dissociated gently by pipetting for 4 - 5 times and centrifuged at 200 x g for 4 minutes . The cell pellet was washed once with 1x PBS , centrifuged again and resuspended in 1 - 2 mL of FC . Cell suspensions containing 12 , 000 Doxycycline - treated CAG - GFP tetO - Gata4 ESCs and 12 , 000 E14 ESCs were pelleted again by centrifugation . This is the number of cells needed for 1 experimental well and it is scaled linearly for each additional well . After resuspending in 1ml of FC medium , the cell suspension was added dropwise to the AggreWell and the plate was centrifuged at 100 x g for 3 minutes . Media change was performed every 24 hours by adding 1 mL of fresh FC medium after removing 1ml of medium from each well . TGF - β inhibition was performed by adding at the indicated concentrations ( 5 µM or 10 µM ) for the entire culture duration . Cysts were collected at 96 hours post - seeding , and either processed for RNA extraction or fixed and processed for immunofluorescence . Feeder cell ( FC ) medium comprises Dulbecco’s modified essential medium ( Gibco 41966052 ) , 15 % foetal bovine serum ( Gibco 10270106 ) , 1mM sodium pyruvate ( Gibco 11360039 ) , 2mM GlutaMAX ( Gibco 35050038 ) , 1 % MEM non - essential amino acids ( Gibco 11140035 ) , 0 . 1mM 2 - mercaptoethanol ( Gibco 31350010 ) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( Gibco 15140122 ) . Generation of hPSCs stably expressing ZNF398 Stable transgenic hPSCs expressing ZNF398 were generated as previously described in 13 . hPSCs were transfected with PiggyBac ( PB ) transposon plasmid with piggyBac transposase expression vector pBase . In order to generate the PB plasmids , the candidate ZNF398 was amplified from cDNA and cloned into a pENTR2B donor vector . Then , the transgene was Gateway cloned into the same destination vector containing PB - CAG - DEST - bghpA and pGK - Hygro selection cassette . For DNA transfection , 250 , 000 hPSCs were dissociated as single cells with TrypLE ( Gibco 12563 - 029 ) and were co - transfected with PB constructs ( 550 ng ) and pBase plasmid ( 550 ng ) using FuGENE HD Transfection ( Promega E2311 ) , following the protocol for reverse transfection . For one well of a 12 - well plate , we used 3 . 9 μl of transfection reagent , 1 μg of plasmid DNA , and 250 , 000 cells in 1 ml of E8 medium with 10 µM Y27632 ( ROCKi , Rho - associated kinase ( ROCK ) inhibitor , Axon Medchem 1683 ) . The medium was changed after overnight incubation and Hygromycin B ( 200 μg / ml ; Invitrogen 10687010 ) was added after 48 hours . For the overexpression experiments , hPSCs stably expressing an empty vector or ZNF398 were plated to form the 3D structures and treated with DMSO or 10 µM SB43 for 4 days . RNA sequencing and analysis Quant Seq 3 ' mRNAseq Library Prep kit ( Lexogen ) is used for library construction . Library generation is initiated by oligodT priming . The primer already contains Illumina - compatible linker sequences . After first strand synthesis the RNA is removed and second strand synthesis is initiated by random priming and a DNA polymerase . The random primer also contains Illumina - compatible linker sequences . Second strand synthesis is followed by a magnetic bead - based purification step . The library is then amplified , introducing the sequences required for cluster generation . External barcodes are introduced during the PCR amplification step . Library quantification is performed by fluorometer ( Qubit ) and bioanalyzer ( Agilent ) . QuantSeq Forward contains the Read 1 linker sequence in the second strand synthesis primer , hence NGS reads are generated towards the poly ( A ) tail and directly correspond to the mRNA sequence . QuantSeq FWD maintains strand - specificity and allows mapping of reads to their corresponding strand on the genome , enabling the discovery and quantification of antisense transcripts and overlapping genes . Sequencing is performed on NextSeq500 ILLUMINA instruments to produce 5 million reads ( 75bp SE ) for the sample . The reads were trimmed using BBDuk ( BBMap v . 37 . 87 ) , with parameters indicated in the Lexogen data analysis protocol . After trimming , reads were aligned to the Homo sapiens genome ( GRCm38 . p13 ) using STAR ( v . 2 . 7 . 6a ) . The gene expression levels were quantified using featureCounts ( v . 2 . 0 . 1 ) . Genes were sorted removing those that had a total number of counts below 10 in at least 3 samples . All RNAseq analyses were carried out in the R environment ( v . 4 . 0 . 0 ) with Bioconductor ( v . 3 . 7 ) . We computed differential expression analysis using the DESeq2 R package ( v . 1 . 28 . 1 ) 64 . DESeq2 performs the estimation of size factors , the estimation of dispersion for each gene and fits a generalised linear model . Transcripts with absolute value of log2 [ FC ] > 1 and an adjusted p - value < 0 . 05 ( Benjamini – Hochberg adjustment ) were considered significant and defined as differentially expressed for the comparison in the analysis . Single cell RNA library preparation and sequencing For single cell library prep , ~ 30 3D cysts structures for each time point were collected and dissociated using Trypsin / EDTA for 5 min at room temperature . Cells were then washed with PBS , and the resulting cell suspension was used to sort individual live cells in 96 well plates . Full length single cell RNA - seq was performed using a modified version of the Smart - seq2 protocol 42 as in 65 . Briefly , individual cells were sorted into 96 well plates containing lysis buffer in presence of RNase inhibitor , dNTPs and OligodT . Reverse transcription of the polyadenylated RNA was performed with Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase and Template Switching Oligos . The resulting cDNA was amplified with 23 cycles of PCR and libraries were prepared for sequencing with miniaturized NexteraXT Illumina protocol . Libraries were sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 500 System ( single - end 75bp reads ) . Single cell RNA sequencing data processing Following quality controls , sequencing reads were quality and adaptor trimmed using Trim Galore ! v0 . 5 . 0 ( https : / / www . bioinformatics . babraham . ac . uk / projects / trim _ galore ) ( parameters : - - stringency 3 – q 20 ) . Trimmed reads were next aligned to the human reference genome ( GRCh38 . p13 ) using Hisat2 66 . Indexes for transcriptome - guided genome alignment were generated for the human GENCODE release 32 annotation ( extract _ exons . py and extract _ splice _ sites . py scripts ) . Gene expression levels were quantified with featureCounts v1 . 6 . 1 67 ( options : - t exon - g gene _ name ) using the human GENCODE release 32 annotation ( https : / / www . gencodegenes . org / human / release _ 32 . html ) . Multi - mapped reads were excluded from quantification . The following criteria were applied to exclude low - quality cells from subsequent analyses : less than 10 , 000 reads assigned to annotated transcripts ; less than 2 , 000 detected genes , resulting in 394 cells . Single cell RNA sequencing data analysis Single cell gene expression counts were next analyzed following the R / Bioconductor workflow 68 . First , normalization factors were computed using the computeSumFactors function ( scran package , default parameters ) and read counts were normalized and log - transformed using the logNormCounts function ( scater package , default parameters ) . Variance modeling for feature selection was next performed using the modelGeneVar function ( scran package , default parameters ) . Each experimental batch was processed independently . The two experimental batches were then integrated using the matching Mutual Nearest Neighbors ( MNN ) approach 69 with the following pipeline : ( i ) selecting the top 4000 variable genes in each batch ; ( ii ) running the multiBatchNorm function ( batchelor package , default parameters ) to harmonize library sizes across batches ; running the fastMNN function ( batchelor package , default parameters ) ; using the top 50 MNN corrected dimensions for downstream analyses . Dimensionality reductions by t - SNE and UMAP were obtained using the runTSNE and runUMAP functions ( scater package , parameters : perplexity = 10 ) . Graph - based clustering was next performed using the buildSNNGraph function ( scran package , parameters : k = 10 ) and cluster _ louvain function ( igraph package ) . Cluster markers were identified by iteratively comparing gene expression levels of cells in each cluster against all the remaining cells ( one vs all approach ) , implemented by running a Wilcoxon rank - sum test for each gene ( matrixTests package ) , performing Bonferroni multiple hypothesis testing correction and reporting genes with adjusted p - value < 0 . 05 and expressed in at least 10 % of cells in each comparison . Pseudotime analysis was performed by re - running the batch correction pipeline described above for the selected cell types ( settings : top 5000 variable genes and 50 top MNN components ) and fitting a trajectory on the obtained UMAP space ( runUMAP function from scater package , parameters : min _ dist = 0 . 05 ) with Monocle3 70 ( reverse graph embedding by running the learn _ graph function with parameters and order _ cells function with default parameters ) , setting as the starting point of the trajectory the earliest principal point of the 0 : PSC 2D cells cluster . For the comparative integrated analysis with the human embryo cell populations , the embryo dataset and the two experimental batches of the 3D epiblast dataset were integrated using the MNN approach with the following settings : ( i ) selecting the top 2500 variable genes in each batch ; ( ii ) running the multiBatchNorm ; running the fastMNN function . Clustering , cluster markers and t - SNE embedding ( perplexity = 15 ) were then obtained as described above . Immunofluorescence analysis 3D structures were fixed with 2 % Formaldehyde in PBS for 45 min at room temperature and then washed twice for 5 min in PBS . Permeabilisation and blocking were performed simultaneously by incubating samples with 1 % BSA ( Sigma Aldrich ) in PBS with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 for 3 h at room temperature . Then samples were incubated 24 h at + 4°C with primary antibodies ( see Table 1 ) , diluted in blocking solution . The day after , samples were washed with blocking solution three times for 15 min and then incubated 24 h at + 4°C with secondary antibodies ( see Table 1 ) , diluted in blocking solution . Samples were then washed once with blocking solution for 15 min , then with PBS without MgCl2 / CaCl2 two times for 15 min . Samples were adapted to and then mounted in Fluoromount - G ( Southern Biotech ) . Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 ( ThermoFisher Cat . 62249 ) and F - actin with Phalloidin 488 ( see Table 1 ) . Images were acquired with a Leica SP5 confocal microscope equipped with a charge - coupled device camera usingLeica LAS AF software . Quantification of images DAPI and phalloidin signals were quantified with FIJI software . We measure signal intensity along a line connecting the edge of each structure to the centre ( radius ) . We took 7 measurements for each structure and analysed 3 structures for each sample , of similar size . Of each structure we analyse an equatorial confocal plane , containing a lumen , when present . Flow cytometry After dissociation in single - cell suspension using TrypLE , cells were resuspended in PBS and filtered . Cells were analysed according to MIXL1 - GFP expression with BD FACSCantoTM II cytometer and BD FACSDivaTM ( v . 9 . 0 ) software . Quantitative PCR Total RNA was isolated using Total RNA Purification Kit ( Norgen Biotek 37500 ) , and complementary DNA ( cDNA ) was made from 500 ng using M - MLV Reverse Transcriptase ( Invitrogen 28025 - 013 ) and dN6 primers . For real - time PCR SYBR Green Master mix ( Bioline BIO - 94020 ) was used . Primers are detailed in Table 2 . Three technical replicates were carried out for all quantitative PCR . GAPDH was used as an endogenous control to normalise expression . qPCR data were acquired with QuantStudio™ 6 & 7 Flex Software 1 . 0 . Statistics and reproducibility No statistical method was used to pre - determine sample size , but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications 13 , 47 , 49 , 51 . For each dataset , sample size n refers to experimental replicates and is represented by the number of dots in the plots or stated in the figure legends . Statistical analysis was performed within the R software environment ( v4 . 0 . 4 , https : / / www . R - project . org / ) . Statistical significance was determined using the two - tailed Welch’s unpaired t - test ( t . test function with default parameters ) , or Quasi - Poisson regression for count data ( glm function , family = “quasipoisson” ) . Data distribution was assumed to be normal , but this was not formally tested . No data points were excluded . P - values are reported in the plots , indicated as their numerical values . Unless stated otherwise , data are expressed as the mean ± standard errors of the mean ( s . e . m . ) of replicated independent experiments , shown as dots . All error bars indicate s . e . m . . All key experiments were repeated between two and four times independently , as indicated . All qPCR experiments were performed with three technical replicates .
