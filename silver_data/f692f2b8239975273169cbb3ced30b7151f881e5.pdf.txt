Additional anthropogenic development is likely to cause further fragmentation and degradation of forests inhabited by the dusky pipistrelle bat ( Pipistrellus hesperidus ) . We used eight microsatellite markers to study the genetic diversity , population structure , and migration , of P . hesperidus ( n = 120 ) across 14 sites in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu - Natal provinces of South Africa . We examined the effect of contemporary land cover types on genetic differentiation to assess whether current levels of urbanization and agricultural development affect gene flow . High gene flow and low population structure were evident across sampled sites , apart from genetic discontinuities at the northern ( Oribi Gorge Nature Reserve ) and southern ( Alexandria Forest ) ends of the seaboard . Genetic discontinuity at Oribi Gorge may relate to anthropogenic modification of two rivers surrounding the forest , while the Alexandria - linked barrier is a climatic break known as the Bedford gap . Migration rates generally were low between sites except for one Scarp forest , Manubi State Forest , from which individuals dispersed to other sites . The Amatole Mistbelt forests supported high genetic diversity , and likely served as a refugium for P . hesperidus during the Last Glacial Maximum . The composition of land cover classes between sites was a poor predictor of genetic differentiation , although it seems likely that P . hesperidus uses riparian habitats and wetlands for dispersal . Lastly , urban and agricultural development did not have a significant effect on genetic differentiation , which may reflect the wide niche breadth and intermediate distribution range of the species . This study provides insights into genetic diversity and gene flow of P . hesperidus across the study region prior to agricultural intensification and large - scale urbanization . Keywords : Agricultural development , Chiroptera , clutter - edge , fragmentation , genetic diversity , microsatellites , Pipistrellus hesperidus , population structure , riparian habitat , urbanization South Africa’s indigenous forests form the smallest biome in the country , covering less than 1 % of the land surface ( Mucina and Geldenhuys 2006 ) but supporting the highest diversity ( ~ 14 % ) of threatened terrestrial vertebrates of all South African biomes ( Castley 1997 ) . Most forests are smaller than 100 ha in size and often occur as small fragmented patches ( < 10 ha—Mucina and Geldenhuys 2006 ) . They are distributed along the eastern and southern seaboard and on south - facing slopes of the Great Escarpment ( von Maltitz et al . 2003 ; Berliner 2009 ) , with the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu - Natal provinces holding the largest proportions of indigenous forest ( 46 % and 29 % , re - spectively ; total area of 229 , 729 ha and 141 , 294 ha , respec - tively ) in the country . Of all the provinces , the Eastern Cape has the lowest proportion of forest ( 4 . 75 % ; 10 , 916 ha ) under strict Type 1 protection ( Berliner 2009 ) , as determined by the National Environmental Management Protected Areas Act ( NEMPAA—SANBI 2018 ) . These forests are located within the Maputaland - Pondoland - Albany global biodiversity hotspot but also within the poorest rural areas of the country ( Berliner 2009 ) .

The development plan seeks to grow the economic potential of rural areas by transforming small towns into industrial hubs , expanding and intensifying agricultural production , and increasing built infrastructure ( Eastern Cape Planning Commission 2014 ) . Future land use change , in the form of urbanization and agricultural intensification , albeit necessary for economic development , poses a threat to South African biodiversity through habitat destruction and degrada - tion ( Bomhard et al . 2005 ; O’Connor and Kuyler 2009 ) . Bats are important faunal components of ecosystems as they constitute the second largest order of mammal species and comprise many functional guilds ( Wilson and Reeder 2005 ) . Bats provide several vital ecological services : frugivores main - tain and regenerate forest by dispersing seeds over large dis - tances , nectivorous bats perform plant pollination services , and insectivores are crucial for the suppression of insect pest populations ( Kunz et al . 2011 ) . In addition , bats are useful bioindicators that show sensitivity to habitat loss , fragmenta - tion , and agricultural intensification ( Jones et al . 2009 ) . The highest bat species richness in southern Africa extends along the eastern seaboard of southeast South Africa , encompassing the Afromontane and coastal forest mosaic , northwards along the coast of Mozambique ( Cooper - Bohannon et al . 2016 ; Herkt et al . 2016 ) . Considering both the prospective development for the Eastern Cape and the high bat diversity associated within its forested regions , it is important to assess the possible impacts anthropogenic development may have on bats in this area . Understory insectivorous and carnivorous bats are sensitive to human - induced disturbances in Neotropical forests , with spe - cies of Least Concern conservation status demonstrating notable preferences for well - preserved forests ( García - Morales et al . 2013 ) . Smith et al . ( 2016 ) found clutter and clutter - edge func - tional groups ( species that fly within and on the edge of dense / cluttered vegetation ) were most impacted by anthropogenic development . In addition , tree - roosting insectivores are more susceptible to genetic erosion from forest fragmentation than cave - roosting species ( Rossiter et al . 2012 ; Meyer et al . 2016 ) . Pipistrellus hesperidus ( Chiroptera : Vespertilionidae ) , known as the dusky or African , pipistrelle ( Monadjem et al . 2010 , 2016 ; Kearney 2013 ) , was selected for this study as it is a clutter - edge insectivore , occurring in the understory of forests in the eastern region of southern Africa ( Monadjem et al . 2010 ) . It is listed by the IUCN as having a conservation status of Least Concern at the regional and global scale ( Monadjem et al . 2016 ; Piraccini 2016 ) . Although P . hesperidus ’ roosting habits are not well known , it has been found roosting beneath loose bark of dead trees ( Smithers 1971 ) . Thus , it provides a good model system to investigate the impact of future land use in the study region . Habitat composition of a landscape affects dispersal and the resultant population structuring of a species . Gene flow through a landscape and spatial population differentiation may be affected by anthropogenic changes to a region and by the configuration of suitable and unsuitable habitats ( Manel et al . 2003 ) . The relationship between landscape variables and genetic differentiation can be used to infer which landscape components enable or inhibit gene flow ( Storfer et al . 2010 ) . Pipistrellus hesperidus is restricted to habitats with woody veg - etation ( Monadjem et al . 2010 ) , and use savanna woodlands , as well as Afromontane and coastal forests ( Cooper - Bohannon et al . 2016 ) . Because forests are highly fragmented in South Africa ( von Maltitz et al . 2003 ) , it is likely that there is limited habitat connectivity among patches , which may impede gene flow of P . hesperidus across the region . Also , agricultural inten - sification is known to alter bat communities ( Cleary et al . 2016 ) and is thought to have been the cause of severe population de - clines for many bat species in Europe ( Wickramasinghe et al . 2003 ) . Although urbanization generally is viewed as the most ecologically damaging change to land use ( Jung and Threlfall 2016 ) , species in the family Vespertilionidae generally are con - sidered to be urban adapters ( Jung and Kalko 2011 ) , with some pipistrelles being highly successful in urban areas ( Gehrt and Chelsvig 2004 ; Ancillotto et al . 2016 ; Schoeman 2016 ) . Pipistrellus hesperidus is a small bat of approximately 6 g with short , broad wings and low wing loading ( Monadjem et al . 2010 ) . Short and broad wings allow for maneuvera - bility in dense vegetation habitats but typically are not well adapted for long - distance flights ( Norberg and Rayner 1987 ) . Bats with this wing morphology and associated flight capabil - ities are considered to have a reduced dispersal potential , typ - ically resulting in lower genetic diversity and greater genetic structuring across their ranges ( Burns and Broders 2014 ) . Bat species exhibiting this wing morphology and high population structuring are more vulnerable to habitat fragmentation and localized extinction ( Safi and Kerth 2004 ; Burns and Broders 2014 ) . Little is known of the abundance and current popula - tion trends of P . hesperidus ( Monadjem et al . 2016 ; Piraccini 2016 ) . Here , we aimed to study the genetic diversity and popu - lation structuring of P . hesperidus across the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu - Natal provinces of South Africa because it is char - acterized by an inferred reduced dispersal ability , is dependent on fragmented wooded habitats , and is facing a changing land - scape . We investigated the presence of possible genetic barriers and whether contemporary migration is occurring across the region , to identify and conserve areas hosting high diversity and facilitating gene flow . Lastly , we examined which contem - porary land cover types are permeable to gene flow to evaluate the functional connectivity of the landscape for P . hesperidus , and assessed whether current levels of urbanization and agri - cultural development impact gene flow . Materials and Methods Study area . — We used samples from 14 sites spanning across the KwaZulu - Natal and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa ( Fig . 1 ; Table 1 ) . The forests are classified into eight types of three groups according to von Maltitz et al . ( 2003 ) . Samples were used from six Mistbelt forests belonging to the Southern Mistbelt group . We surveyed six forests of the Scarp group , classed as Pondoland Scarp and Transkei Coastal Scarp types , and two forests of the Southern Coastal group ( Fig . 1 ; Table 1 ) . MOIR ET AL . —GENE FLOW OF THE DUSKY PIPISTRELLE 1589 Sample sizes from individual sites were low . We pooled sam - ples for analyses based on forest type because they are broadly similar in geographic location and habitat structure . Sample collection . — Sampling was carried out from August 2017 to December 2018 . Mist nets ( 14 - mm mesh size ; Ecotone , Sopot , Poland ) and three - bank harp traps ( Faunatech , Victoria , Australia ) were used to sample 116 P . hesperidus individuals in study forests ( Fig . 1 ; Table 1 ) . A 2 - mm wing punch was col - lected from each individual and stored in 96 % ethanol , after which procedure bats were released at site of capture . The cap - ture and handling of bats was undertaken in accordance with the 2016 Guidelines of the American Society of Mammalogists for the use of wild mammals in research and education ( Sikes et al . 2016 ) . The study was approved by the Stellenbosch University Animal Use and Care Research Ethics Committee ( protocol # 0409 ) and licensed by Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Agency ( RA0237 , CRO 59 / 17CR , CRO 60 / 17CR ) , the Department of Agriculture , Forestry and Fisheries ( WIFM 04 - 2016 , WIFM 09 - 2017 , WIFM 06 - 2018 ) , Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife ( OP 143 / 2018 , OP 3847 / 2018 ) , and South African National Parks ( CHER - MI / 2018 - 004 ) . Supplementary tissue samples were sourced from the Durban Natural Science Museum . DNA extraction , polymerase chain reaction , and genotyping . — Total genomic DNA was extracted from wing punches and museum tissues using a Nucleospin Tissue kit ( Macherey - Nagel , Düren , Germany ) . Microsatellite loci are ver - satile among bat species ( Burland et al . 1999 ) and cross - species amplification from libraries developed for Vespertilionidae has been successful for other Pipistrellus species ( Ka ň uch et al . 2007 ) . We tested the amplification of 22 microsatellite loci developed for six species within the Vespertilionidae family , of which 11 successfully amplified . Primers were 5 ′ - end la - beled with a florescent dye for amplification between three multiplexes . Details of primers and labels used are provided in Supplementary Data SD1 . Polymerase chain reactions ( PCRs ) were carried out with 5 µ l KAPA2G Fast Multiplex Mix ( Kapa Biosystems , Cape Town , South Africa ) , 1 – 2 µ l template DNA ( 5 ng / µ l ) , varying volumes of forward and reverse primers ( Supplementary Data SD1 ) , and distilled water to a total reac - tion volume of 10 µ l . The PCR protocol consisted of an initial 5 min denaturation at 94°C , followed by 30 cycles of denatur - ation at 94°C for 30 s , annealing for 30 s at 51°C for multiplex 1 , 57 . 5°C for multiplex 2 , and 60°C for multiplex 3 , elongation at 72°C for 30 s , with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min .

The key of symbols displays classifications of forest type as per von Maltitz et al . ( 2003 ) . The white areas within the map represent the countries of Eswatini and Lesotho ( for which land cover data were not used ) . Only a small portion of land cover at the northernmost edge of the study area was excluded as a result . 1590 JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY products were quantified on an ABI3730xl Genetic Analyzer ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , California ) at the Central Analytical Facility of Stellenbosch University . Microsatellite fragments were visualized and scored using Geneious 9 . 0 ( https : / / www . geneious . com ) . Approximately 20 % of all sam - ples were re - amplified and re - scored for error checking . Data quality and genetic diversity . — Micro - checker 2 . 2 . 3 was used to detect data input errors , allelic dropout , null alleles , and stuttering ( Van Oosterhout et al . 2004 ) . Tests for deviations from Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium were carried out in Genepop 4 . 2 ( Raymond and Rousset 1995 ) . We corrected P - values for multiple hypothesis testing using sequential Bonferroni correction with a threshold α of 0 . 05 . Observed ( H O ) and unbiased expected heterozygosity ( u H E ) , and allelic richness ( AR ) were calculated with the diveRsity package ( Keenan et al . 2013 ) in the R statistical environment ( R Core Team 2019 ) . The number of private alleles ( P A ) per site was calculated in GenAlEx v6 . 5 ( Peakall and Smouse 2012 ) . Genetic clustering . — Two Bayesian clustering analyses were used to ascertain the spatial structure of the genetic data : STRUCTURE ( Pritchard et al . 2000 ) and TESS v2 . 3 ( Chen et al . 2007 ) . Both programs use Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) simulations with hierarchical Bayesian modeling to assign individuals to clusters by minimizing linkage disequilib - rium and maximizing Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium ( François and Durand 2010 ) . We used both programs as STRUCTURE relies only on individual genotypes without use of a spa - tial prior distribution , whereas TESS uses a spatially explicit model with geographic coordinates to estimate ancestry coeffi - cients ( François and Durand 2010 ) . It often is useful to employ different genetic clustering approaches to detect underlying structure . Closely related individuals within populations have been reported to bias Bayesian clustering methods ( Rodríguez - Ramilo and Wang 2012 ) . The degree of relatedness between pairs of individuals was assessed using TrioML ( Wang 2007 ) in Coancestry 1 . 0 . 1 . 9 ( Wang 2011 ) . Relatedness densities were plotted to determine the exclusion threshold as described by Halczok et al . ( 2017 ) . We manually selected the threshold of 0 . 32 from the plotted distribution , as it best separated closely related individuals from unrelated individuals . One individual of a pair , sampled from the same site , exceeding the related - ness threshold was removed from the data set for both Bayesian clustering methods . We ran STRUCTURE assuming an admixture model with correlated allele frequencies ( Hubisz et al . 2009 ) . Twenty inde - pendent runs were undertaken with K = 1 – 7 ( number of pooled sample sites + 1 ) . The most likely number of clusters was deter - mined using the Evanno ∆ K statistic , which is the second - order rate of change of log probability between successive values of K ( Evanno et al . 2005 ) . All runs used 10 million iterations after a burn - in of 100 , 000 . Results were plotted with Pophelper ( Francis 2016 ) . We used the conditional autocorrelation ( CAR ) Table 1 . — List of study sites , grouped by forest type according to the classification of von Maltitz et al .

TESS requires a range of K MAX values which are the assumed maximum number of clusters ( Safner et al . 2011 ) ; hence , clusters K = 2 – 7 were tested . We employed 200 runs per K , a burn - in of 50 , 000 sweeps and a total run time of 100 , 000 sweeps . The Deviance Information Criterion ( DIC ) scores were used to determine the most likely number of clusters . Twenty percent of the lowest DIC scores were retained to identify K with the highest likeli - hood and lowest DIC . The DIC also was averaged over all runs as the most appropriate K may coincide with the plateau of the DIC curve . Furthermore , we used a nonparametric clustering method , AWCLUST ( Gao and Starmer 2008 ) , to complement the two parametric methods described above because it is robust to small samples ( < 10 ) and violations of assumptions of the Hardy – Weinberg and linkage equilibrium ( Deejai et al . 2010 ) . We generated pairwise allele sharing distance matrices and mul - tidimensional scaling plots with AWCLUST . The plots allowed for visualization of putative clusters and identification of out - liers . We calculated gap statistics for each value of K with 100 null simulations . We tested K = 1 – 14 ( total number of sites ) because this method is not sensitive to sample sizes . Individuals were assigned to clusters based on hierarchical clustering plots . Population structure . — Pairwise population structure was in - vestigated with D est ( the harmonic mean across loci for each pairwise population—Jost 2008 ) and G ″ ST ( expected het - erozygosity and corrected for sampling a small number of populations—Meirmans and Hedrick 2011 ) calculated in GenAlEx v6 . 5 ( Peakall and Smouse 2012 ) . Sites with n < 5 samples were excluded from the pairwise D est and G ″ ST ana - lyses . Significance levels for pairwise tests were adjusted using Bonferroni correction . Barriers and migration rates . — Barrier v2 . 2 ( Manni et al . 2004 ) was used to detect possible genetic barriers across the landscape . Barrier uses a computational geometry ap - proach with Monmonier’s maximum difference algorithm on a Delaunay triangulation to detect an abrupt rate of change in genetic differentiation ( Manni et al . 2004 ) . The R package diveRsity ( Keenan et al . 2013 ) was used to bootstrap 1 , 000 pairwise D est distance matrices for input into Barrier . Bayesian inference of recent migration rates , within the last two gener - ations , between the sites was carried out with BayesAss v3 . 04 ( Wilson and Rannala 2003 ) . We ran BayesAss for 50 million generations with a burn - in of 10 million and sampled every 1 , 000 generations . The step sizes of migration rates ( m ) were adjusted to 0 . 6 , allele frequencies ( a ) to 1 . 0 , and inbreeding coefficients ( f ) to 0 . 3 to correct acceptance rates such that they remained between 20 % and 60 % throughout the run ( Rannala 2015 ) . Because this method is sensitive to low and uneven sample sizes , we pooled samples into three forest groups ( Mistbelt , Scarp , and Coastal ) and re - ran the analysis . Tracer v1 . 7 . 1 ( Rambaut et al . 2018 ) was used to evaluate adequate mixing and whether convergence had been reached prior to the end of the burn - in . Effect of distance and land cover on gene flow . — We tested for the effects of land cover type and Euclidean distances be - tween sites on gene flow . G ″ ST was used as a measure of ge - netic differentiation and was calculated with GenAlEx v6 . 5 ( Peakall and Smouse 2012 ) . Straight - line Euclidian distances were measured between sampling locations . The home range size or distance P . hesperidus travels to move between roosts currently is unknown . Feyerabend and Simon ( 2000 ) found P . pipistrellus to have travelled a maximum distance of 15 km be - tween roosts in Hessen , Germany . Pipistrellus hesperidus is similar in size to P . pipistrellus , the two species therefore may possibly have similar dispersal capabilities ; thus , a buffer ra - dius of 15 km was employed . The 2018 South African National Land Cover data set was used to characterize land cover types within the buffers extending between forest localities . The pro - portion of land cover types was calculated in ArcGIS Pro v2 . 4 ( ESRI , Redlands , California ) . Land cover types were grouped into four classes that are expected to affect the movement of P . hesperidus : developed ( all types of built - up areas , mines , and quarries ) , forest ( indigenous and planted forest ) , open habitats ( shrubland , grassland , barren , and cultivated land ) , waterbodies and wetlands ( natural and artificial waterbodies , and herbaceous and woody wetlands ) . Wetlands were grouped with waterbodies , and not in the open habitat category , because bat activity and species richness in South Africa are markedly higher in wetlands than surrounding open habitats ( Sirami et al . 2013 ) . We thought it best to group wetlands with watercourses that are also known to support high bat activity ( Zeale et al . 2012 ) . Agricultural areas were combined with natural open areas , because we considered the dispersal resistance of these open habitats to be comparable for the study species . Ocean and beach areas were excluded from the analysis . To compare the effects of land cover and Euclidean distance on genetic distance , we used multiple regression on distance matrices ( MRM function ) with the ecodist package ( Goslee and Urban 2007 ) in R ( R Core Team 2019 ) . Collinearity be - tween predictor variables was tested with variance inflation factors ( VIFs ) using the car package ( Fox 2002 ) . Land cover variables showed collinearity , which may hinder the interpre - tation of multivariate regressions ; thus , only univariate models were used . The univariate models included additive and inter - action terms of the land cover class predictors in combination with Euclidean distance . Landscape genetics analyses typically use a resistance matrix approach to evaluate how land use af - fects gene flow wherein each land cover type is assigned a re - sistance value based on specialist opinion or ecological field data ( Hall and Beissinger 2014 ) . Keeley et al . ( 2017 ) reported animals to be more sensitive to habitat suitability in the home range than during dispersal and mating movements . We opted to use proportions of the land cover classes ( developed , forest , open , and waterbodies and wetlands ) in large linear buffers over the resistance matrix approach , because basic information on roost utilization and movement ecology of P . hesperidus is not available , and the assignment of resistance values is likely to be error - prone . Talbot et al . ( 2017 ) favored this approach for 1592 JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY volant animals , as opposed to those with lower dispersal cap - abilities , because they may easily traverse small high - resistance areas and respond to land cover on a broader landscape scale . Results A total of 120 individuals from 14 sample sites were genotyped for 11 microsatellite loci , with no individuals unscored at more than two loci . Difficulties in amplification and / or scoring of historic museum material were encountered , so only four mu - seum samples , from Hlatikulu Forest Reserve ( Fig . 1 ) , were included in the analyses ( museum accession numbers DM 14331 – 14334 , collected in 2014 ) . For error checking , all sam - ples re - amplified successfully and 97 % scored the same . Locus D15 was found to be monomorphic at 91 nucleotides and was discarded from all analyses . Evidence of null alleles and sig - nificant departures from Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium were detected for loci Ppip02 and P13 ; accordingly , both loci were excluded from all analyses . We found no evidence of linkage disequilibrium . Thus , we used a total of eight loci across all analyses . The number of alleles ranged from 4 ( locus F19 ) to 24 ( locus Ppip03 ) ; ( Supplementary Data SD1 ) . Observed het - erozygosity ranged from 0 . 562 ( Hlatikulu and Silaka ) to 0 . 650 ( Xumeni ) across all loci , and unbiased expected heterozygosity ranged from 0 . 612 ( Oribi Gorge ) to 0 . 715 ( Baziya ) ; ( Table 1 ) . Average allelic richness was 2 . 728 , ranging from 2 . 527 ( Oribi Gorge ) to 2 . 855 ( Silaka ) ; ( Table 1 ) . A total of 15 private alleles were found , with nine of the 14 sites possessing at least one private allele . Manubi and Fort Fordyce were the sites with the highest number of private alleles ( Table 1 ) . Genetic clustering . — Six pairs of individuals were found to exceed the relatedness threshold ; one individual of each pair was removed from the data set . All genetic clustering analyses were run with eight loci for 114 individuals . The optimal values for K were not consistent across the three clustering methods . The DIC plot for K MAX from TESS did not plateau , and K = 4 was selected with the lowest DIC value ( 6489 . 59 ) . The pro - portions of all individuals assigned to each genetic cluster mostly were symmetrical in the resulting plot from TESS , with the exception of the Amatole Mistbelt forest type ( Fig . 2A ) . This illustrates a lack of population structuring between all forest types with a slight differentiation of Fort Fordyce in the Amatole Mistbelt . Two genetic clusters were selected based on the mean Ln P ( K ) = −3 , 948 . 12 and Δ K from the results of STRUCTURE ( Supplementary Data SD2 ) . There was no clear assignment of any individuals to either of these genetic clus - ters , thus indicating a lack of population structure ( Fig . 2B ) . Gap statistics of AWCLUST depicted the appropriate number of clusters was K = 3 ( Supplementary Data SD3 ) . The results of AWCLUST also portray a lack of genetic clustering , indicating general dispersion of all individuals within the multidimen - sional scaling plot ( Fig . 2C ) . Population structure . — Pairwise D est and G ″ ST values gen - erally were low between sites ( Supplementary Data SD4 ) . Pairwise D est ranged from −0 . 045 to 0 . 114 with four of the 35 values ( 11 . 4 % ) significant after Bonferroni correction . Pairwise G ″ ST ranged from −0 . 064 to 0 . 161 , also with four of 35 values significant . The highest significant D est and G ″ ST values were between Alexandria and Ngeli ( 0 . 161 and 0 . 114 , respectively ) , with Alexandria demonstrating all significant pairwise values ( Supplementary Data SD4 ) . Barriers and migration rates . — Two main barriers were identified : the barrier of highest bootstrap support depicts ge - netic discontinuity of Oribi Gorge from surrounding sites , with a further barrier differentiating Alexandria ( Supplementary Data SD5 ) . The remaining barriers were not reported , be - cause they had lower bootstrap support values and were not supported by other analyses . The BayesAss analysis displayed limited contemporary migration between sites over the past two generations ( Supplementary Data SD6 ) . The proportion of migrant individuals range from 0 . 0117 to 0 . 0195 between all sites , except Manubi . Albeit low , the migration rate of in - dividuals emanating from Manubi is between 7 and 14 times greater than all other sites , with the rate between 0 . 090 ( migra - tion from Manubi to Umtamvuna ) and 0 . 171 ( migration from Manubi to Gomo ) . The analysis with pooled samples illustrated considerably higher migration rates originating from Scarp forest toward the other forest groups ( 0 . 317 to Mistbelt , 0 . 288 to Coastal ) , while migration between the other forest groups was low ( 0 . 006 – 0 . 023 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . Effect of distance and land cover on gene flow . — The test for isolation by distance ( IBD ) using the straight - line distance be - tween sites was not significant ( R 2 = 0 . 0357 ; P = 0 . 343 ; Table 2 ) . The IBD plot displays a slight positive trend of increased ge - netic differentiation with Euclidean distance , but with high scatter around the line ( Supplementary Data SD7 ) . The propor - tions of developed , forest , and open habitat , land cover classes had nonsignificant , negative relationships with G ″ ST . The pro - portion of waterbodies and wetlands between sites was the only land cover class found to be related to genetic differentiation ( P = 0 . 024 ; Table 2 ) . However , Fig . 4 shows variability in the data with high scatter of points around the regression line . The low coefficient of determination ( R 2 = 0 . 0161 ) value indicates the proportion of wetlands and waterbodies between sites ex - plains only 1 . 61 % of the variation of G ″ ST . The additive and interaction models , encompassing combinations of predictor land cover variables with Euclidean distance , only returned significant results for models including the waterbodies and wetlands land cover class . All combinations of additive and in - teraction terms of the waterbodies and wetlands class with dis - tance showed significant relationships . However , these models returned lower R 2 values than the univariate model using only the waterbodies and wetlands land cover class . Thus , the signif - icant results were driven by the effects of this land cover class . Discussion Main findings . — Despite P . hesperidus bearing a wing mor - phology indicative of low dispersal potential and a dependence on fragmented wooded habitats as a clutter - edge forager , we found a lack of population structuring and high gene flow across Eastern Cape and KwaZulu - Natal provinces of South Africa MOIR ET AL . —GENE FLOW OF THE DUSKY PIPISTRELLE 1593 Fig . 2 . —Inferred population structure of Pipistrellus hesperidus from the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu - Natal provinces of South Africa gener - ated using eight polymorphic microsatellite loci .

This general finding was with the exception of genetic discontinuities for Oribi Gorge and Alexandria from other sites ( Supplementary Data SD5 ) . The diversity metrics do not depict a loss of heterozygosity among sites ( Table 1 ) . Nearly all pair - wise D est and G ″ ST values were not significant ( Supplementary Data SD4 ) , and there was no IBD effect ( Supplementary Data SD7 ) . Our results show that P . hesperidus is , thus , likely not dependent on forested habitats to maintain genetic connec - tivity on the landscape . We found contemporary migration to be originating from Manubi , with few migrants emanating from other sites ( Supplementary Data SD6 ) . The generally low population structure between sites indicates that migrants from Manubi may be the largest contributors to gene flow across the region . Fort Fordyce was identified as one of the sites with the highest expected heterozygosity , allelic richness , and number of private alleles ( Table 1 ) , indicating significant genetic diver - sity is held within the Amatole Mistbelt forests . Furthermore , we found land cover composition between sites to be poor predictors of genetic differentiation for this species and no measurable effect of the current extent of an - thropogenic development on gene flow . The proportion of waterbodies and wetlands was the only land cover to demon - strate a significant relationship , indicating it to be permeable to gene flow ( Table 2 ; Fig . 4 ) . Albeit a weak association , ri - parian habitats and wetlands are known for their importance to bats for drinking , foraging , and commuting ( Lookingbill et al .

A few select sites are presented to orientate the reader to schematic location . MOIR ET AL . —GENE FLOW OF THE DUSKY PIPISTRELLE 1595 2010 ; Sirami et al . 2013 ) . In addition , P . hesperidus shows a strong preference for utilization of riparian forest over open sa - vanna habitat in Eswatini ( Monadjem and Reside 2008 ) . Thus , it seems likely that this species uses riparian habitats and wet - lands for dispersal to maintain the genetic connectivity across the landscape . Infrequent gene flow and female philopatry . — Not much is known of the movement and dispersal of P . hesperidus within South Africa . The low population structure observed indicates high gene flow . However , the migration rate between sites over the past two generations , as inferred from the BayesAss anal - ysis , suggests gene flow events may not be occurring frequently ( Supplementary Data SD6 ) . Pipistrellus pipistrellus can live for approximately 16 years in the wild ( Gaisler et al . 2003 ) . If P . hesperidus has a similar life span , it would have a generation time of multiple years , such that gene flow events would not need to occur every year to maintain genetic connectivity be - tween sites . Alternately , persistent low - level migration may be sufficient to homogenize population structure . In addition , little is known of this species’ mating system . Other Pipistrellus species demonstrate female resource polygyny ( Gerell and Lundberg 1985 ) , with males holding courting territories along the females’ flight routes ( Barak and Yom - Tov 1991 ) . This sug - gests females remain in natal areas and dispersal is male - biased . Genetic analyses with mitochondrial DNA observed popula - tion structuring between these forests ( Moir et al . 2020 ) , yet the present study showed low structuring with nuclear markers . This indicates gene dispersal may be male - mediated and fe - males are philopatric , a common system in Vespertilionidae bats ( Burland et al . 2001 ; Santos et al . 2016 ) . Oribi Gorge and Alexandria . — To the best of our knowl - edge , this study provides the first indication of a genetic dis - continuity between Oribi Gorge with Umtamvuna and Ngeli for any vertebrate taxon . It may be a result of anthropogenic modification of the Mzimkhulu and Mzimkhuluwana rivers that surround Oribi Gorge and connect it to Ngeli . Sugarcane farms straddled both rivers from as early as the 1900’s ( Lewis 1990 ) , causing deterioration of the water courses ( Matavire Fig . 4 . —Plot of significant results from multiple regression on distance matrices displaying slight negative relationship of genetic differentiation ( G ″ ST ) with the proportion of land cover of wetlands and waterbodies between sites for Pipistrellus hesperidus in South Africa . 1596 JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY 2015 ) along the lower reaches of these rivers . The Weza - Ngeli forest , situated inland along these rivers , has long been exploited for timber : since the 1890’s ( McCracken 1986 ) . Alien timber trees are notorious for high levels of water abstraction in South Africa ( Albaugh et al . 2013 ) , thereby affecting the upper reaches of the river system . In the 2018 National Biodiversity Assessment , both rivers were identified as modified , with most reaches classed ei - ther as Critically Endangered or Endangered ( Skowno et al . 2019 ) . The removal of riparian vegetation by sugarcane farming and plantation forestry practices may deter P . hesperidus ( a clutter - edge specialist ) from using such watercourses , thereby hindering possible dispersal events . However , the small sample size presented in this study is an important limitation to the in - ferences that can be made . Preliminary results of a population genetics study of three forest bird species : white - starred robin ( Pogonocichla stellata ) , Cape batis ( Batis capensis ) , and chor - ister robin - chat ( Cossypha dichroa ) show similar genetic struc - ture between Oribi Gorge and Ngeli ( J . Mulvaney , Stellenbosch University , pers . comm . ) . This study identifies the Oribi Gorge area and its surrounds as worthy of further investigation . The barrier of Alexandria is a well - known climatic break called the Bedford gap ( Lawes 1990 ) and is of biogeographical importance in southern Africa ( Willows - Munro and Matthee 2011 ) . The Bedford gap is a semiarid area with xeric vegeta - tion that separates the forests of the eastern and southeastern Cape . The climate and vegetation of the Bedford gap are a re - sult of the intruding ingression of the Karoo subdesert biome ( Lawes 1990 ) . The gap has been identified as a barrier to gene flow for the Cape mole - rat ( Georychus capensis ) ; ( Visser et al . 2018 ) , limiting the distribution of the samango monkey ( Cercopithecus albogularis ) ; ( Lawes 1990 ) and dark - footed forest shrew ( Myosorex cafer ) ; ( Willows - Munro 2008 ) , and speciation of the common slug eating snake ( Duberria lutrix ) ( Kulenkampff et al . 2019 ) . This is the first record of the sug - gested effect of the Bedford gap on a volant taxon . Migrants from Manubi . — Mistbelt forests are biogeograph - ically ancient and were most severely affected by climatic extinction filtering during the Last Glacial Maximum ( LGM ) ( Eeley et al . 1999 ) . Scarp forests were mostly unaffected by the cooling and drying effect of the LGM and served as refugia to forest fauna , with subsequent recolonization to Mistbelt for - ests . Coastal forests have a more recent origin and also were colonized by fauna from Scarp forests ( Lawes et al . 2007 ) . The sampled sites were pooled to visualize migration rates between forest groups ( Fig . 3 ) . This study may represent the first genetic work in support of Lawes et al . ’s ( 2007 ) findings , because mi - gration of P . hesperidus emanates primarily from Scarp forests toward the Mistbelt and Coastal forests . When the BayesAss analysis was run with individual sites , we found the Scarp forest migration originated solely from Manubi . It is unclear as to why migrants disperse from Manubi to other sites , but do not disperse from other sites to - ward Manubi using the same routes . We recommend this as the basis for further work on P . hesperidus in the region . The mi - gration estimates may be biased by small and uneven sample sizes with Manubi , as the better sampled site , being identified as the source of migrants . Nonetheless , this site appears to be a source of genetic diversity for forest - utilizing bats and birds . The Temminck’s myotis ( Myotis tricolor ) and Botswana long - eared bat ( Laephotis botswanae ) from this forest had unique , highly differentiated mtDNA haplotypes ( Moir et al . 2020 ) . The yellow - throated woodland warbler ( Phylloscopus ruficapilla ) and chorister robin - chat displayed higher genetic diversity from Manubi than other forests in the Eastern Cape ( J . Mulvaney , Stellenbosch University , pers . comm . ) . Manubi also holds high bird species and functional richness relative to other Eastern Cape forests ( Leaver et al . 2019 ) . It is evident that Manubi is an important forest for diversity across different taxa . Amatole Mistbelt as a refugium . — The high genetic diversity of P . hesperidus found at Fort Fordyce , in the Amatole Mistbelt forest complex , indicates it has been able to support sizeable populations , such that it was not likely to have been recently founded from a Scarp refuge . The diversity metrics ( Table 1 ) suggest P . hesperidus endured past climate change in small sheltered refugia within the Mistbelt forest ( Lawes 1990 ) , which has been reported for the mesophytic , flowering herb genus Streptocarpus within the same forest complex ( Hughes et al . 2005 ) . The Amatole Mistbelt forests are relatively exten - sive , covering an area of approximately 35 , 000 ha ( von Maltitz et al . 2003 ) . The large size of the complex may have contributed to its resilience during the LGM . The Fort Fordyce population also demonstrated a greater observed than expected heterozy - gosity ( Table 1 ) , indicative of the isolate - breaking effect which is the mixing of two previously isolated populations . This may suggest the subsequent genetic connectivity of two populations that were separated within small refugia of the forest complex . This finding of P . hesperidus taking refuge within the complex is supported by mtDNA analyses in which Fort Fordyce haplo - types showed a more ancient status ( Moir et al . 2020 ) . Lack of effect of agricultural development and urbanization on gene flow . — Generally , a higher degree of urbanization and agricultural development decreases habitat use by bats ( Jung and Threlfall 2016 ) , but bats have shown mixed responses to anthropic changes to the environment that are typically highly species - specific ( Duchamp et al . 2004 ; Klingbeil and Willig 2009 ) . Sensitivity of a species to fragmentation and urbaniza - tion often is dependent on traits associated with mobility , niche breadth ( Safi and Kerth 2004 ) , ability to exploit matrix habitats ( Farneda et al . 2015 ) , and flexibility in roosting and foraging be - havior ( Jung and Threlfall 2016 ) . Agricultural and urban areas did not have a measurable effect on gene flow of P . hesperidus ( Table 2 ) , possibly due to the species having a relatively wide niche breadth and intermediate range ( Cooper - Bohannon et al . 2016 ) . Not much is known of the roosting ecology and pref - erences for dispersal habitat of the study species . Our results may suggest a greater flexibility in roost selection , a lower de - pendency on well - wooded habitats than recorded to date , or the ability to disperse through matrix habitats ( or a combination of these traits ) . Further contributing factors to the lack of observed genetic structure may be explained by a genetic lag effect whereby MOIR ET AL . —GENE FLOW OF THE DUSKY PIPISTRELLE 1597 recent changes to the landscape have not yet manifested in the genetic signature of the species ( Landguth et al . 2010 ) , partic - ularly considering P . hesperidus may be long - lived with a long generation period . Also , the Eastern Cape is considerably less developed than other regions of South Africa , such that anthro - pogenic disturbances have not yet reached a threshold beyond which an effect is detectable . Species exposed to recent hab - itat transformations provide the opportunity to study the mech - anisms of contemporary gene flow and adaptation to habitat changes ( Stockwell et al . 2003 ) . This study provides the first insights into genetic diversity and gene flow of P . hesperidus across the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu - Natal provinces prior to agricultural intensification and large - scale urbanization of the region . This study may be used as a baseline with which to measure the impacts of future development on this species .
