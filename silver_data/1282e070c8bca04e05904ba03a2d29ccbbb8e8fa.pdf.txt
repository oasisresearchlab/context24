Scott Armstrong The Wharton School , University of Pennsylvania William B . Denniston , Jr . 2 nd Lieutenant , U . S . Army Matt M . Gordon H . J . Heinz Inc . , Pittsburgh , PA ABSTRACT One hundred and fifty - one subjects were randomly divided into two groups of roughly equal size . One group was asked to respond to a decomposed version of a problem and the other group was presented with the direct form of the problem . The results provided support for the hypotheses that people can make better judgments when they use the principle of decomposition ; and that decomposition is especially valuable for those problems where the subject knows little . The results suggest that accuracy may be improved if the subject provides the data and the computer analyzes it , than if both steps were done implicitly by the subjects . One of the basic notions behind the scientific method is that a problem should be explicitly " decomposed " or broken down into a series of subproblems . Solutions are then obtained for each subproblem , and these solutions are combined as described by Raiffa ( 1968 , p . 271 ) : The spirit of decision analysis is to divide and conquer : Decompose a complex problem into simpler problems , get one ' s thinking straight in these simpler problems , paste these analyses together with a logical glue . . . Polya ( 1948 ) provided a general discussion on the use of decomposition in problem solving and Hertz ( 1964 ) provides an example of decomposition in the capital investment problem . With the decomposition principle , one can generally take account of more factors than when making direct or global judgments . In addition , it would seem possible to analyze information on the various components more effectively by " computer " than by doing it in one ' s head . It is also expected that decomposition will improve accuracy since the errors from the parts should tend to compensate for one another . In view of these advantages , the following hypotheses are suggested on the use of decomposition relative to the use of direct estimation : H1 : Use of the decomposition principle will lead to more accurate judgments in most situations ; H2 : The value of the decomposition principle is greatest where uncertainty is high . We were unable to find much empirical evidence which was relevant to the above hypotheses . One exception was provided by Einhorn ( 1972 ) , who found that decomposition led to better predictions of life span for people with Hodgkin ' s disease than could be obtained by global judgments . Below we describe a small study which was specifically designed to test the two hypotheses . 2 METHODS Design In order to compare the direct and decomposed methods , it seemed worthwhile to choose problems in which there was a " known " answer . It was also important to contrast problems about which the subjects were likely to have good information with those where they knew little . Five problems were selected ; they are presented here in order from those which were thought to be easy to answer directly , to those which would be difficult ( the answers are also provided here ) . 1 . How many families were living in the United States in 1970 ? ( Answer : 57 million . Source : World Almanac ) 2 . How many students do you think dropped out of high school ( grades 9 - 12 ) in the United States in 1969 ? ( Answer : 2 , 690 , 000 . Source : World Almanac ) 3 . How many packs ( rolls ) of Polaroid color films do you think were used in the United States in 1970 ? ( Answer : 51 million . Source : Annual Reports , Polaroid Corporation ) 4 . How many pounds of tobacco were produced in the United States in 1969 ? This includes tobacco which was used for cigarettes , pipes , cigars , and chewing . It also includes tobacco which was exp orted . ( Answer : 1 . 8 billion . Source : Statistical Abstract of the United States , 1972 5 . A Philadelphia radio station and a chewing gum company cosponsored a contest in 1972 . The contest asked all metropolitan Philadelphia high schools to submit as many postcards as they could with the message " Carefree Sugarless Gum " handwritten on them . There was no limit to number of cards that could be submitted by a single student or a single school . The school that submitted the most cards was the location of a free rock concert by the " Grass Roots " band . The contest was heavily promoted . How many postcards were submitted in the contest ? ( Answer : 66 . 5 million . Source : WIBG Radio Station , Philadelphia , PA ) . This ranking of difficulty was verified by asking a convenience sample of six students to rank them according to how well they thought they could estimate the answers . Their rankings were identical with ours . Mean rankings were 1 . 0 for Families , 2 . 4 for Dropouts , 2 . 8 for Film , 4 . 0 for Tobacco , and 5 . 0 for Contest . It may be noted that the rankings were very clear - cut except for the Dropouts and Film problems . The decomposed form of the problems was generated by two of the authors and another professor . None knew the " true answers " when this step was carried out . The basic strategy was ( 1 ) to decompose each problem into as many parts as were relevant to the answer and could be managed in a reasonable amount of time , ( 2 ) to make the parts of roughly equal importance to the answer , ( 3 ) to select parts about which there was relatively good general information , and ( 4 ) to be sure that the final answer could be obtained from the parts by simple , arithmetic operations . As may be noted , the decomposition also relied heavily upon bounded estimates from 0 to 100 % . The decomposed questions were as follows : 1 . a . What was the population of the U . S . in 1970 ? _ _ _ _ _ b . How many people were there in the average family living in the U . S . in 1970 ? _ _ _ _ _ 2 . a . What do you think was the population of the U .

However , few subjects wrote any calculations on their questionnaires . Subjects Three groups of graduate and undergraduate students from classes at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania were tested . Group I was composed of 50 students drawn from three separate classes ; Group II was composed of 50 students drawn from two classes ; and Group III was composed of 51 students from two classes . In each class an attempt was made to randomly split the students into two equal subsamples ; one subsample was given the direct questions while the other was given the decomposed questions . 4 Procedure Each of the authors and one another person was used in the adminis tration of the questionnaires . The administrators were instructed not to discuss the purpose of the experiment to the subjects prior to , or during the testing . The instructions and other aspects of the situation varied according to the group . Group I was given three problems ( Dropouts , Film , and Tobacco ) . The following instructions were read : We ' re doing a study on decision making and would like you to help us out . It will take you less than 15 min . We will be happy to let you know how close your answers are to the true answers . Please be certain to answer every question . If you are uncertain about any answer , give your best estimate . If you have any questions , raise your hand . Thank you for your cooperation . Group II was given all five problems . In addition , rewards of $ 15 , $ 10 , and $ 5 were offered for the 3 students ( out of 50 total ) who provided the most accurate answers . The following instructions were read : We ' re doing a study on decision making and would like you to help us out . It will take you less than 15 min . There will be cash prizes of $ 15 , $ 10 , and $ 5 for the three students who give the best answers . Please be certain to answer every question . If you are uncertain about any question , give your best estimate . If you have any questions , raise your hand . Thank you for your cooperation . Group III was also given all five problems . The procedures for this group were the same as those for group 11 except that minor revisions were made in the wording of the questions to improve clarity , the order of the questions was reversed , there was no reward , and the following instructions were read : We are doing a study on decision making . While we cannot explain the purpose of this experiment at the present time , it is very important that you try to be as accurate as possible and that you answer every question . You will have 15 min . Please use the complete 15 min but make sure that you have completed all of the questions in this time . You will be notified when 10 min remain , then 5 min , then 1 min . Begin immediately . In summary , it may be noted that certain key factors were varied over the course of the experiment . These included the setting of the experiment ( it was administered at eight different times to eight different classes by four different administrators ) ; the instructions ; the wording of the questions ; the ordering of the questions ; and the use of a reward vs . no reward . Data Analysis The accuracy ratio was used as the criterion . This was obtained by dividing the " estimate " by the " actual " in cases where the estimate exceeded actual . If actual exceeded the estimate , then actual was divided by estimate . In simpler terms , the larger of the two numbers was placed in the numerator and the smaller in the denominator . For example , if the actual value for a given problem were 10 , then answers of both 2 and 50 would have accuracy ratios of 5 . The primary advantage of this ratio was that it eliminated problems with scaling so that the errors in the different problems might be compared with one another . Another advantage was that the loss function was symmetrical - in other words , there was no advantage for the subject to try to bias his answers on either the high or low side . RESULTS The results from Groups I , II , and III are presented in Table 1 . The subjects providing the decomposed estimates did worse than those providing direct estimates on only one of the 13 comparisons . Furthermore , on 9 of the 13 comparisons the decomposed version was significantly more accurate ( significant at . 05 level using the median test from Siegel , 1956 ) . The estimates obtained using decomposition were also less likely to have large errors . For 5 example , for all groups combined , 64 % of the direct estimates for the Tobacco problem were off by a factor of ten or more , while only 20 % of the decomposed estimates for this problem were off by such a degree . These results support hypothesis H1 that use of the decomposition principle leads to more accurate estimates . There was ' no evidence that accuracy was affected by a reward . Follow - up discussions with each group also led to mixed reactions as to whether the reward had any effect and , if so , what would be the direction of the effect . In any event , decomposition led to significant improvements with or without the use of a reward . TABLE 1 Median Accuracy Ratio : Decomposed vs .

While the number of questions for Group I was too small to allow for a test of statistical significance , the rankings in Groups II and III were each significant at the . 05 level ( using Spearman Rank Correlation from Siegel , 1956 ) . Thus , the results also support H2 - - i . e . , that the value of decomposition is greatest where the subject ' s knowledge is poorest . FURTHER RESEARCH Further research would be useful in trying to better define how the decomposition should be carried out . For example , does it help to use bounded questions ? To what degree should the problem be decomposed ? What role does the scaling ( units ) of the answers have upon the results ? Is it better to have the subject decompose the problem in order to make better use of his own information ? We did some exploratory work on this last question by comparing 11 subjects who decomposed two problems with 11 subjects who were provided with a decomposed ver - sion . The self - decomposition was poorer on each question , but the differences were not significant . REFERENCES Raiffa , H . ( 1968 ) , Decision Analysis . Reading , Mass . : Addison - Wesley .
