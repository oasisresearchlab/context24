rsb 17 Apr 16 Snowball Sampling Snowball sampling is a recruitment method in which an investigator enlists the help of a research subject in identifying , and possibly recruiting , additional subjects . It is useful when the investigator may not have access to a population of potential subjects who meet inclusion criteria , which may often be stigmatizing . There are two different approaches to snowball recruitment . In the first method , the investigator asks a person to inform potential subjects about the research project and share the investigator’s contact information . It is then up to the potential subjects to contact the investigator . The informed consent process should make it clear that agreeing to contact others is not a requisite for participating in the research . Also , the researcher should not offer a reward or a “bounty” for recruiting subjects . This method rarely presents ethical issues for the IRB . The second method is more common but problematic . The investigator asks the first recruited subject for contact information about potential subjects and then contacts them directly . The major ethical issue is that the first subject may be divulging information about other people that they would prefer to be kept confidential . And it is especially problematic when the referring individual is a person of authority in the community . The IRB would evaluate very carefully the context in which this approach to recruitment is occurring . The Boise State University IRB has a good discussion of snowball sampling .
