Although higher synthetic valencies have been achieved by conjugation of either monoclonal antibodies or single - chain antibodies to nanoparticles and liposomes , a method for the preparation of recombinant antibodies with valencies similar to IgM’s ( decavalent ) but considerably less than what is generally found after antibody particle conjugation has yet to be devised . Recently , we have developed a methodology for the design of bivalent Chemically Self - Assembled Antibody Nanorings ( CSANs ) . We now report the crystal structure of the nanoring subunit composed of the E . coli DHFR dimer and a methotrexate dimerizer ( MTX2 - C9 ) containing a visible nine methylene linker and a protocol for the preparation of CSANs from this subunit with valencies similar to IgM’s , ranging from 8 - 10 single chain antibodies ( scFvs ) . The multivalent CSANs were reversibly assembled from a fusion protein dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR ) - DHFR - antiCD3 scFv containing a single glycine linker between the two DHFR scaffolding proteins . We also demonstrate that , similar to the parental bivalent anti - CD3 monoclonal antibody ( mAB ) , anti - CD3 CSANs selectively bind to CD3 + leukemia cells and undergo rapid internalization through a caveolin - independent pathway that requires cholesterol , actin polymerization , and protein tyrosine kinase activation . While treatment with the monoclonal antibody leads to T - cell activation and nearly complete loss ( i . e . , 90 % ) of the surface displayed T - cell receptor ( TCR ) , only 25 - 30 % of the TCR down regulate and no significant T - cell proliferation is observed after treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) with anti - CD3 CSANs . Consistent with the proliferation findings , 15 - 25 % less CD25 ( IL - 2 receptor ) was found on the surface of PBMCs treated with either the polyvalent or bivalent anti - CD3 CSANs , respectively , than on PBMCs treated with the parental mAB . Comparative experiments with F ( ab ' ) 2 derived from the mAB confirm that the activation of the T - cells by the mAB is dependent on the Fc domain , and thus interactions of the PBMC T - cells with accessory cells , such as macrophages . Taken together , our results demonstrate that anti - CD3 CSANs with valencies ranging from 2 to 8 could be employed for radionuclide , drug , or potentially oligonucleotide delivery to T - cells without , as has been observed for other antibody conjugated nanoparticles , the deleterious effects of activation observed for mAB . Further the CSAN construct may be adapted for the preparation of other multivalent scFvs . For full article click here [ 3 ] Qing Li† , Christopher R .
