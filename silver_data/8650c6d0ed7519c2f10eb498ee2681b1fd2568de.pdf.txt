A helical cell body is formed by an internal ribbon of MreB , an actin 22 superfamily , and Spiroplasma - specific fibril proteins . Here we have solved the structure of 23 the fibril filament by single - particle cryo - electron microscopy at 3 . 6 Å resolution and built 24 its atomic structure . The structure is composed of repeated rings and cylinders . The N - 25 terminal cylinder of the fibril protein shows a structure similar to that of S - 26 adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase , while the C - terminal ring does not show similarity to 27 other proteins . The filament is nonpolar and flexible , possessing a helical pitch of 700 nm , 28 consistent with cell helicity . Cryo - electron tomography revealed aligned several MreB 29 filaments in the center of the ribbon , flanked by membrane - binding fibril filaments 30 through electrostatic interactions . This study discusses the evolution and roles of the fibril 31 filament . 32 33 Introduction 34 Spiroplasma sp . , a member of the class Mollicutes characterized by a small genome size , 35 is spread worldwide ( 1 ) . They significantly impact industry and organisms other than 36 themselves , including plants such as corn and citrus fruits and arthropods such as crabs 37 and flies . One of the successful features of this bacterium may be its unique swimming 38 mechanism , leading to efficient migration and , thus , habitat expansion ( 2 ) . Swimming is 39 facilitated by switching the helical cell body between left - and right - handed , in which the 40 rotation of the cell helix behind a kink caused by the switching of helix handedness pushes 41 the water backward ( 3 - 6 ) . The helix formation and switching in Spiroplasma cells lacking 42 a peptidoglycan layer are plausibly caused by an internal “ribbon” structure ( 7 , 8 ) . The 43 ribbon is composed of MreB ( 8 - 10 ) , known as bacterial actin ( 11 ) , and fibril , a protein 44 specific to the genus Spiroplasma ( 12 , 13 ) . A recent study reported that combining two 45 types of Spiroplasma MreB proteins causes motility similar to swimming in a minimal 46 synthetic bacterium , JCVI - syn3B ( syn3B ) ( 14 - 16 ) . This indicates that the conformational 47 change in MreB is responsible for the force generation for swimming . MreB is a bacterial 48 actin that has a critical role in peptidoglycan synthesis in walled bacteria ( 17 ) and diverges 49 into five classes in the evolution to class Mollicutes ( 18 , 19 ) . The fibril protein , another 50 significant component of the ribbon , is one of the most abundant proteins in Spiroplasma 51 cells and is well conserved in the genus Spiroplasma , as featured by more than 90 % amino 52 acid sequence similarity ( 3 , 9 , 12 ) . Interestingly , the helical pitch of the isolated fibril 53 filaments is comparable to that of a Spiroplasma cell . Moreover , the N - terminal half of the 54 fibril protein shares up to 20 % similarity with S - adenosylhomocysteine ( SAH ) 55 nucleosidase , which is essential for bacterial growth ( 3 , 7 , 20 ) . These points raise 56 questions about the possible role and evolutionary origin of the fibril protein in 57 Spiroplasma swimming and survival . To answer these questions , determining the structure 58 of the fibril protein and the ribbon construction is crucial . Previously , we isolated the fibril 59 protein from Spiroplasma cells and showed a low - resolution structure ( 12 ) . In this study , 60 we performed single - particle cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) of the isolated fibril 61 filament and cryo - electron tomography ( cryo - ET ) of Spiroplasma and the motile syn3B 62 cells to clarify the fibril protein . 63 64 Results 65 Cryo - EM single - particle analysis of the fibril filament 66 We isolated fibril filaments from Spiroplasma cells using a previously established method 67 ( 12 ) and performed cryo - EM observation for single particle analysis . As good - quality 68 images were obtained ( Fig . 1a ) , segmented images of 300 nm length along the filaments 69 were extracted with 90 % overlap between consecutive segments , followed by 2D 70 classification ( Fig . 1b ) . The 3D image was then reconstructed for the single - stranded 71 filament from 13 , 825 segmented images . The resulting structure had a resolution of 3 . 6 Å 72 with a Fourier shell correlation of 0 . 143 ( Supplementary Fig . 1 and 2 ) . Based on the cryo - 73 EM map , including six subunits , an atomic model of the fibril protein was constructed 74 ( Fig . 1c - d ) . To estimate the helical pitch and handedness of the fibril filament , we made a 75 long 3D density map of the fibril filaments by extending the short segment map to a length 76 of half helical pitch ( Fig . 1e ) . The reconstructed fibril filament was left - handed , and the 77 half - helical pitch was approximately 350 nm . The shape of the fibril filament was 78 characterized by the rings with a 105 Å long axis , connected by the cylinders with an 89 Å 79 periodicity ( Fig . 1c ) . These characteristics of the fibril filament were consistent with the 80 structure previously revealed by negative staining electron microscopy ( 12 ) . 81 82 Atomic model of the fibril filament 83 In the atomic model , all 512 amino acid residues of the fibril protein were assigned to the 84 cryo - EM map ( Fig . 1d , Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . The amino acid sequence of the fibril 85 protein can be divided into the N - terminal 228 - residue sequence with approximately 20 % 86 similarity to SAH nucleosidase and the C - terminal sequence . The atomic model of the 87 fibril filaments showed that the 228 residues on the N - terminal side mainly correspond to 88 the cylinder , whereas the C - terminal region primarily corresponds to the ring ( Fig . 1d ) . 89 Three interaction surfaces ( i ) - ( iii ) were found between subunits in the fibril filament , 90 which were characterized by the dominance of non - polar side chains ( Fig . 2a ) . The 91 interface ( i ) consists of three α - helices , including four non - polar and three polar side 92 chains . Interface ( ii ) consists of four loops , including eight non - polar and two polar side 93 chains . Interface ( iii ) consists of four β - sheets and one loop , including 13 non - polar side 94 chains . These interactions may suggest elasticity and robustness as characteristics of fibril 95 filaments . 96 We compared the fibril protein structure with that of SAH nucleosidase from Escherichia 97 coli ( IJYS ) ( Fig . 2b , Supplementary Fig . 3 ) ( 21 ) . In SAH nucleosidase , the adenine - 98 binding site consists of Glu175 , Arg194 , Ser197 , and Asp198 on two β - strands , an α - helix , 99 and a loop . In contrast , the residues of the fibril protein corresponding to the adenine 100 binding site of the nucleosidase were partially mutated to Glu171 , Lys190 , Tyr193 , and 101 Asn197 , respectively ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . In addition , the Val335 – Lys347 chain of the 102 C - terminal domain of the same subunit was found to bind to the position corresponding to 103 the adenine - binding pocket ( Fig . 2b , Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . The α - helix composed of 104 residues Met10 – Gly22 of the nucleosidase is replaced by β - strands composed of residues 105 Tyr9 – Lys13 and Val333 – Asn336 in the fibril protein ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Based on 106 these observations , we concluded that the fibril protein does not retain nucleosidase 107 activity . 108 109 Structural flexibility of the fibril filament 110 To discuss possible conformational changes of the fibril filament , we examined its 111 structural variation in the cryo - EM particle images . The 147 , 040 particle images used to 112 reconstruct the high - resolution cryo - EM map were re - extracted with a box size of 450 nm 113 to include 10 fibril protein subunits . The 2D classification was performed based on these 114 images to identify possible single - stranded filaments . The resulting 81 , 139 particles were 115 subjected to 3D variability analysis in the cryoSPARC software . The structural changes of 116 the fibril filaments were specified by continuous movements in three directions , while 117 distinct movements were found in two directions . One was a forward bending toward the 118 ring , and the other was a bending lateral to the ring ( Fig . 3a – b ) . These flexibilities allow 119 variations in the helical pitch and a diameter of 300 – 680 and 20 – 100 nm , respectively 120 ( Fig . 3c ) . 121 122 Cryo - ET of the internal ribbon 123 We examined the internal ribbon structure composed of MreB and fibril proteins by cryo - 124 ET in Spiroplasma cells . Spiroplasma cells suspended in PBS were applied to EM grids , 125 blotted from one side of the grid , and rapidly vitrified in liquid ethane . The prepared grids 126 were imaged by cryo - EM in continuous tilt . The motion - corrected tilt series were aligned , 127 and the three - dimensional tomograms were reconstructed . The reconstructed tomograms 128 of the Spiroplasma cells visualized the internal ribbon structure running the whole length 129 of the helical cell body in the more than 30 cells examined ( Fig . 4a ) ( Movie S1 ) . The 130 ribbon was characterized as a sheet structure with several filaments in top view . It was 131 bound to the cell membrane at its lateral edge in a sectional view at a middle height , 132 suggesting that the ribbon is localized in the innermost line of the helical cell body ( Fig . 133 4a ) . The cells showed both left and right helix handedness as well as a half - helical pitch 134 distributing from 320 to 500 nm , which are consistent with those observed by optical 135 microscopy , suggesting that the cells retained structural characters in the vitrified ice ( Fig . 136 4b ) ( 12 ) . The inter - filament distance in the ribbon differed with the filament positions , i . e . , 137 approximately 10 and 5 nm in the central and peripheral parts , respectively ( Fig . 4c ) . 138 To identify the two filaments in the ribbon of Spiroplasma cells composed of MreB and 139 fibril proteins , the syn3B cells expressing either a combination of MreB4 and MreB5 140 ( MreB4 – 5 ) ( 14 ) or the fibril protein were subjected to cryo - ET . The ribbon - like sheet 141 structures bound to the cell membrane were found in the syn3B cells of both constructs , 142 running the whole length of the helical parts of the cell body in all of the more than 30 143 cells examined ( Fig . 4c ) ( Movie S2 ) . The half - helical pitch was approximately 300 nm 144 ( Fig . 4b ) . The syn3B cells with MreB4 – 5 showed both left and right helical handedness , 145 while the syn3B cells with fibril protein showed only left helical handedness . These 146 observations are consistent with previous optical microscopy observations ( 12 ) . The peak 147 intervals estimated from the protofilament density profiles were 5 and 10 nm for the cells 148 expressing MreBs and fibril , respectively ( Fig . 4c ) . Based on these observations , we 149 concluded that the ribbon structure of Spiroplasma cells is composed of the MreB and 150 fibril filaments in the central and peripheral parts , respectively ( Fig . 4c ) . 151 152 Subtomogram averaging of the in situ fibril filament 153 To clarify the intracellular structure of the fibril filament , we performed subtomogram 154 averaging for cryo - ET of the syn3B cells expressing the fibril protein ( Supplementary Fig . 155 4 and 5 ) . The fibril filaments in the syn3B cells formed sheet - like structures in contact 156 with the cell membrane ( Fig . 5a ) . The density maps of the subtomograms containing three 157 fibril filaments were manually extracted from the tomograms . The extracted particles were 158 then sorted by 2D and 3D classification , and finally , a density map was obtained at a 159 resolution of 16 Å from 5182 particles . The obtained structure had rings facing the cell 160 membrane and cylinders facing the cytoplasm , forming a sheet with adjacent fibril 161 filaments ( Fig . 5b – c ) . When docked to the density map , the atomic model of the fibril 162 protein showed that the side chains at the interface of neighboring fibril filaments were 163 positioned to partially neutralize their positive and negative charges in the C - terminal 164 domain . ( Fig . 5c ) . The interaction between the fibril filament and the cell membrane , 165 specifically the ring portion , was characterized by 14 positively charged residues of the 166 fibril protein . This suggests their electrostatic interactions with the phosphate head groups 167 of the lipids . ( 22 - 24 ) . 168 169 Discussion 170 The N - terminal domain structure of the fibril protein supports the sequence analysis , 171 suggesting that the fibril protein originated from a nucleosidase and achieved a completely 172 different function ( Fig . 2b ) ( 3 , 7 , 12 ) . The phylogenetic tree composed of this domain and 173 the nucleosidase ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) , based on their amino acid sequences , 174 unexpectedly suggested that the fibril protein is more closely related to other genera in the 175 Mollicutes class than to the Spiroplasma genus . This may indicate that horizontal gene 176 transfer was involved in fibril evolution ( 25 ) . Regarding the C - terminal domain , we could 177 not suggest an evolutionary scenario from the structure ( Fig . 1d ) . 178 The structural flexibility was suggested in two directions ( Fig . 3a , b ) . However , these 179 changes are expected to be mixed in actual movements . Because the fibril filament was 180 not depolymerized even by strong sonication ( 12 ) , the fibril filament should have a 181 flexible yet robust spring - like property that supports the helical shape of the cell . The 182 proposed structural changes of the fibril filaments are continuous and do not involve 183 distinct helicity switching ( Fig . 3b ) . The helicity switching that propagates along the entire 184 cell length during Spiroplasma swimming suggests a reversal of handedness in the fibril 185 filaments ( 3 , 4 , 6 , 26 ) . However , the structural analyses in the present study did not 186 suggest any handedness switching of the fibril filament . The helicity switching of the fibril 187 filaments may require a force generated by MreB proteins applied in a specialized manner 188 ( 11 , 27 ) . 189 The alignment of the MreB and fibril proteins in the internal ribbon is critical to 190 understanding the roles of individual proteins in the swimming mechanism ( 7 , 8 ) . We 191 succeeded in tracing the ribbon and visualizing the filamentous structures by cryo - ET of 192 the Spiroplasma and syn3B cells ( Fig . 4 ) . Comparing the lateral filament intervals in the 193 ribbon - like sheets visualized in the cells of Spiroplasma , syn3B with MreB4 – 5 , and syn3B 194 with fibril , we assigned the MreBs and fibril filaments to the central and peripheral parts 195 of the internal ribbon . This conclusion is consistent with a suggestion based on an early 196 cryo - EM study of Spiroplasma melliferum ( 8 ) . We also succeeded in docking the atomic 197 model of the isolated fibril filament to the density map of the ribbon of Spiroplasma cells 198 obtained by subtomogram averaging ( Fig . 5 ) . However , we failed to dock the atomic 199 model of the MreB filament to the density map ( 28 , 29 ) , because a higher resolution was 200 needed than that in the case of the fibril filament . 201 In a previous study , swimming cells reconstituted by helicity switching were expressed by 202 MreB4 – 5 in the syn3B cell ( 14 - 16 ) . Moreover , it is known that a few Spiroplasma species 203 can swim even without the fibril gene ( 30 ) . This suggests that the fibril protein is 204 necessary for neither cell helicity formation nor force generation . Therefore , the question 205 of the role of the fibril protein in Spiroplasma remains . The fibril filament isolated from 206 Spiroplasma cells showed helical parameters similar to those of Spiroplasma cells and 207 syn3B cells expressing MreB4 – 5 . Moreover , the fibril filament formed in the syn3B cells 208 also showed identical helical parameters ( Fig . 4b ) . Considering that the fibril protein 209 forms stable and yet flexible filaments ( Fig . 3 ) just beneath the cell membrane ( Fig . 5 ) . 210 These features suggest that the fibril protein may have a role in stabilizing the shape of the 211 helical cell lacking the peptidoglycan layer to achieve the robustness and efficiency 212 required for repetitive helicity switching of the cell shape . 213 In this study , we also succeeded in characterizing two types of filaments formed by MreBs 214 and the fibril protein in the syn3B cells ( Fig . 4b ) . The synthetic bacterium syn3B has been 215 developed and used to study a minimal system for life ( 31 ) . We have demonstrated that 216 the simple cell structure and small thickness of syn3B may also be advantageous for the 217 analysis of the internal cell structures by cryo - ET ( Fig . 4b ) ( 32 , 33 ) 218 219 220 Materials and Methods 221 Sample preparation . JCVI - syn3B ( GenBank : CP069345 . 1 ) ( 15 , 16 ) , its derivatives ( 14 ) , 222 and Spiroplasma eriocheiris ( TDA - 040725 - 5T ) ( 9 , 34 ) were cultured to mid - log phase in 223 SP4 media at 37°C , 37°C , and 30°C , respectively . The promoter of syn3B for MreB4 – 5 224 expression was changed from Tuf to the native ones ( Fig . S6 ) . The fibril filament fraction 225 was prepared as described previously and adjusted to a concentration of 1 mg / ml in a 226 buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris - Cl pH 8 . 0 and 150 mM NaCl . 227 228 Cryo - EM and image processing . A 1 . 4 μl sample solution was applied onto a glow - 229 discharged holey carbon grid ( Quantifoil R1 . 2 / 1 . 3 Mo grid , Quantifoil Micro Tools , 230 Germany ) , and the grid was plunge - frozen into liquid ethane by Vitrobot mark IV 231 ( Thermo Fisher Science , USA ) with a blotting time of 3 s at 18 °C and 90 % humidity . All 232 the data collection was performed on a prototype of the CRYO ARM 200 ( JEOL , Japan ) 233 equipped with a thermal field - emission electron gun operated at 200 kV , an Ω - type energy 234 filter with a 20 eV slit width , and a K2 Summit direct electron detector camera ( Gatan , 235 USA ) . An automated data acquisition program , JADAS ( JEOL , Japan ) , was used to collect 236 cryo - EM image data , and pre - processing , motion correction , and Contrast Transfer 237 Function ( CTF ) estimation were carried out in real - time by the Gwatch image processing 238 pipeline software ( 35 ) . Movie frames were recorded using the K2 Summit camera at a 239 calibrated magnification of ×40 , 000 corresponding to a pixel size of 1 . 5 Å with a defocus 240 range from −0 . 6 to −1 . 8 μm . The data were collected with a total exposure of 10 s 241 fractionated into 60 frames , with a total dose of ~ 50 electrons Å − 2 in counting mode . A 242 total of 720 movies were collected . 243 Motion correction was performed by MotionCor2 v1 . 4 . 7 , and CTF parameters were 244 estimated by Gctf v1 . 06 . Fibril filament images were automatically selected by RELION 245 3 . 0 as helical objects and segmented into 200 x 200 - pixel boxes with 90 % overlap . The 246 best particles were selected from the results after the 2D classification of these segmented 247 images by RELION 3 . 0 . Segmented images of 237 , 690 were 3D classified into four 248 classes , 147 , 040 segmented images from the best two classes were merged , and 3D auto - 249 refine was applied . Atomic model construction was performed in COOT28 , followed by 250 real - space refinement using PHENIX29 . All 3D maps and model images used in this paper 251 were created with UCSF ChimeraX - 1 . 3 . 252 253 Cryo - ET and image processing . A 3 . 0 μl sample solution containing 10 nm colloidal 254 gold was applied onto a glow - discharged holey carbon grid ( Quantifoil R1 . 2 / 1 . 3 Cu grid , 255 Quantifoil Micro Tools , Germany ) . The grid was plunge - frozen into liquid ethane by 256 Vitrobot mark IV ( Thermo Fisher Science , USA ) with a blotting time of 3 s at 4 °C and 257 90 % humidity . All the data collection was performed on a CRYO ARM 300 II ( JEOL , 258 Japan ) equipped with a cold field - emission electron gun operated at 300 kV , an Ω - type 259 energy filter with a 20 eV slit width , and a K3 Summit direct electron detector camera 260 ( Gatan , USA ) . Movie frames were recorded using the K3 Summit camera at a calibrated 261 magnification of ×25 , 000 corresponding to a pixel size of 2 . 343 Å with a defocus range 262 from −0 . 6 to −1 . 8 μm . The data were acquired at a tilt range from −60 to 60 degrees with a 263 dose - symmetric tilt scheme at 3° increments using serialEM 4 . 0 . 264 Motion correction was performed by RELION’s implement , and CTF parameters were 265 estimated by ctffind4 . Tilt series alignment and tomogram generation were performed in 266 IMOD 4 . 11 . Subtomogram coordinates were manually selected by the 3dmod tool in 267 IMOD . After 2D classification of the segmented subtomogram by RELION 4 . 0 , the best 268 set of particle images was selected from the results . 21 , 973 segmented subtomograms 269 were 3D classified into three classes , 5 , 182 segmented subtomograms from the best 270 classes were selected , and 3D auto - refine was performed .
