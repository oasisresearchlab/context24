Multiple regression : testing and interpreting interactions Leona S . Aiken , Stephen G . West , Raymond R . Reno - 0803936052 , 9780803936058 - 212 pages - Sage Publications , 1991 - 1991 - Multiple regression : testing and interpreting interactions - " I think that the coverage of the text is excellent . It carves out a seriously neglected area and it very thoroughly covers the topic . The authors are very knowledgeable concerning the literature . This is an excellent text that provides a detailed , yet comprehensible account of how to estimate , test , and probe interactions in regression models . " - - David A . Kenny , University of Connecticut " Leona S . Aiken and Stephen G . West do an excellent job of structuring , testing , and interpreting multiple regression models containing interactions , curvilinear effects , or a combination of both . Procedures for testing and graphical displays of interactions between categorical variables have been done for years but none seems to have provided a comprehensive treatment or guideline for the analysis of interactions between continuous variables . . . . Aiken and West , however , address those issues quite effectively and thoroughly . . . . An aid to any graduate and / or researcher in their analysis of continuous variables . Highly recommended for graduate libraries . " - - Choice " The book would serve very well as a reference for applied researchers and methodologists . . . . In particular , this would be an excellent reference for anyone who encounters a multivariable prediction problem and has reason to believe that either a nonlinear model or a model including a variable product term would be appropriate . " - - Contemporary Psychology Researchers in a variety of disciplines frequently encounter problems in which interactions are predicted between two or more continuous variables . However , the current literature regarding how to analyze , interpret , and present interactions in multiple regression has been confusing . In this comprehensive volume , Leona S . Aiken and Stephen G . West provide academicians and researchers with a clear set of prescriptions for estimating , testing , and probing interactions in regression models . Including the latest research in the area , such as Fuller ' s work on the corrected / constrained estimator , the book is appropriate for anyone who uses multiple regression to estimate models or for those enrolled in courses on multivariate statistics . file download roharec . pdf Statistical Methods for Psychology - ISBN : 9780495597841 - Psychology - STATISTICAL METHODS FOR PSYCHOLOGY surveys the statistical techniques commonly used in the behavioral and social sciences , especially psychology and education .
