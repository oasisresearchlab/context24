Abstract Submitted for the MAR05 Meeting of The American Physical Society Growth of Attached Actin Filaments JIE ZHU , A . E . CARLSSON , Physics Department , Washington University in St . Louis — Actin ﬁlaments in cells extend themselves by polymerizing free actin monomers onto their growing ends . The growing ﬁlaments can push obstacles and thus do mechanical work . It is known [ 1 ] that if the ﬁlaments are not attached to the obstacle , new monomers can be added when the obstacle ﬂuctuates away from the growing ﬁlament ends . However , experiments [ 2 , 3 ] show that the growing ends of actin ﬁlaments are ﬁrmly attached to the obstacle . Based on the idea of the Brownian ratchet model , we develop an energy - based model to investigate the growth of attached actin ﬁlaments . In this model , the force ﬁeld describing the interaction between the actin ﬁlament and surface proteins ( such as ActA ) on the obstacle’s surface is given a simpliﬁed but plausible analytic form . We use both Brownian - dynamics simulations and analytical approaches to calculate the attachment time and the growth rate . Our results show that a high binding energy ( ∼ 28kT ) is required for the binding of an actin ﬁlament to the obstacle , and the actin ﬁlament can remain attached to a 25 nm bead for about 30 s , while still growing at about 50 % of the free - ﬁlament growth velocity . * Supported by NSF grant number DMS - 0240770 .
