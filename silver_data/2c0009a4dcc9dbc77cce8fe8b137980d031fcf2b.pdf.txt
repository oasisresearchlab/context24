In these cases , empirical coarse overlays of images are sufficient . However , there is a lack of techniques that reproducibly correlate at the nanometer scale across large areas and are robust enough to allow statistical analysis of protein locations with previously unknown positions . Prior attempts have encountered three major difficulties : fluorescent probes that are incompatible with EM sample preparation , structural deformation between imaging modes and a lack of alignment markers that are stationary at the nanoscale 5 , 10 . We have found that thin , coverslip - bound samples , such as cell membranes , avoid these problems when grown on custom - designed gold nanoparticle – embedded coverslips ; this allows super - resolution 2D and 3D PALM imaging to be com - bined with metal - replica TEM techniques 7 , 11 . With this combined technique we report reproducible nanoscale correlation across 20 - µ m images and statistical analysis of protein localizations on single clathrin - coated structures across the membrane . Cells to be imaged by fluorescence super - resolution microscopy – metal - replica TEM ( Fig . 1 ) were grown on coverslips containing gold nanorods embedded under an ~ 20 - nm layer of silica . The silica - covered nanorods have strong photoluminescence owing to surface plasmon resonance and are visible in iPALM . They extended above the flat surface of the coverslip ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) and transferred with the platinum replica , which allowed them to be used as nanometer - scale iPALM - TEM correlation markers in the xy plane . Proteins were labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 antibody ( AF647 ; Invitrogen ) , and the membrane was labeled with myristoylated psCFP2 , which allowed for iPALM - to - TEM alignment in the z dimension . First we examined 2D correlation across entire cell membranes ( Fig . 2a , b ) . We mapped the xy PALM positions of AF647 antibody – labeled clathrin heavy chain ( clathrin - AF647 ) onto the TEM images ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) with a first - degree polynomial spatial warp transformation that registers positions of gold nanoparticles in PALM and TEM data . For eight cells , 6 – 22 nanoparticles were used for each transformation ( mean = 16 nanoparticles ) , and the mean registration error for nanoparticles in each cell ranged from 3 . 6 nm to 10 . 1 nm . xy localizations from clathrin - AF647 in the PALM image matched the 2D shapes of the clathrin - coated structures ( CCSs ) in TEM ( Fig . 2c , d ) . AF647 is linked to clathrin through a 20 - to 25 - nm antibody complex ; therefore , the fluorescence of a structure is generally larger than that of the TEM image . To assess how the fluorescence mapped to the geometric clathrin lattice observable in TEM , we created average 2D fluorescence density maps of clathrin - AF647 xy PALM localizations with respect to 2D TEM structures correlative super - resolution fluorescence and metal - replica transmission electron microscopy Kem A Sochacki 1 , 4 , Gleb Shtengel 2 , 4 , Schuyler B van Engelenburg 3 , Harald F Hess 2 & Justin W Taraska 1 We combine super - resolution localization fluorescence microscopy with transmission electron microscopy of metal replicas to locate proteins on the landscape of the cellular plasma membrane at the nanoscale . We validate robust correlation on the scale of 20 nm by imaging endogenous clathrin ( in two and three dimensions ) and apply the method to find the previously unknown three - dimensional position of the endocytic protein epsin on clathrin - coated structures at the plasma membrane . Super - resolution localization microscopy ( for example : photo - activated localization microscopy , PALM 1 , or direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy , dSTORM 2 ) can locate fluo - rescently labeled biomolecules at a resolution of 10 – 20 nm using multiple differently colored 3 , 4 or genetically encoded probes 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 . Interferometric PALM ( iPALM ) 6 adds an axial resolution of ~ 10 nm , offering the best resolution among three - dimensional ( 3D ) implementations . However , structure determination with localiza - tion microscopy is limited by labeling densities that do not satisfy the Nyquist sampling criterion , which requires a labeling frequency that is at least twice the frequency of the structure being resolved . Furthermore , molecules that are not fluorescently labeled are invisible to fluorescence microscopy , which results in images that lack their underlying cellular context . In contrast , platinum replicas viewed by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) provide 2 - nm - resolution images of the structural features of cells 7 , 8 . Identification of proteins in these images is usually done by ~ 15 - nm - diameter immunogold labeling . However , gold is bulky , which can cause sparse labeling and obscure the structural details beneath it , and gold is sometimes indistinguishable from dark electron microscopy ( EM ) areas . Thus , super - resolution localization microscopy and metal - replica TEM are complementary methods that can be combined to determine protein positions within a rich cellular context at the resolution of several nanometers in two or three dimensions . 1 National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute , US National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland , USA . 2 Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Janelia Farm Research Campus , Ashburn , Virginia , USA . 3 National Institute of Child Health and Human Development , US National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland , USA . 4 These authors contributed equally to this work .

CCSs were split into two catego - ries according to how their 3D geometries would be projected onto the xy plane ( Fig . 2e ) . The first category , flat and slightly domed pits ( short ) , should exhibit roughly uniform fluores - cence within the perimeter of the CCS . Highly domed pits ( tall ) , however , should exhibit the profile of a hemispherical shell , with intensity peaking near the radius of the shell and dip - ping in the center . For short and tall CCSs , the fluorescence density maps and radial profiles ( Fig . 2e ) agree with geomet - ric simulations ( Fig . 2f ) of flat and hemispherical objects of radius r = 50 nm , with 25 - nm shells extending from their surfaces ( accounting for the immunotether ) , and convolved with a Gaussian - shaped error factor of width σ = 16 nm . Gaussian convolution introduces a statistical sampling dis - tribution to the model that incorporates errors such as those due to PALM - to - TEM registration , PALM localization and visually defining the perimeters of CCSs in TEM . Even with these errors , the average fluorescence density maps demonstrate the close 2D correlation obtainable by this method . We further correlated the fluorescence to 3D tomograms by matching features between the tomogram and the 2D TEM image . We attained correlation in the axial dimension ( z ) by aligning the iPALM z position of a fluorescent membrane marker ( myristoylated psCFP2 ) to the TEM membrane plane ( Fig . 2g ) . Gold nanoparticles could not be used for the z - dimension alignment because they shift in z with respect to the rest of the replica during lifting . 3D correlations of CCSs ( Fig . 2h and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2 ) show that the shapes of the pits in the z dimension in iPALM images match the shapes of the corresponding pits in the TEM tomograms . Occasionally , there were regions in which the fluorescence membrane marker did not align with the TEM membrane ( < 10 % membrane area ) . These regions tended to be where there was a wide ( ~ 1 - µ m ) non - adherent domed membrane patch visible in iPALM that likely collapsed during critical - point drying or replica transfer to the a b c d e f g h i Liquid Sonic waves Cell membrane Cell Au Coverslip Alexa Fluor 647 Objective Marking Replica Pt and C coat TEM grid Film Replica sheet figure 1 | iPALM and TEM correlation imaging pipeline .

In these cases , there was clear membrane misalignment ( Supplementary Fig . 3 and Supplementary Video 3 ) and CCSs were not analyzed . Myristoylated psCFP2 was rarely found inside of clathrin structures but was often found in nonclathrin vesicles ( Supplementary Video 3 ) , a result suggesting that myristoylated proteins may be excluded . We assessed the clathrin - AF647 fluorescence along the z dimension with 1D fluorescence histograms of 96 CCSs ( Fig . 2i ) . Histograms were normalized and ordered by height ( as mea - sured from TEM ) . For the range of heights , clathrin fluorescence extends from 20 – 30 nm above the plasma membrane to ~ 25 nm above the top of the clathrin structure observed by TEM . These distances are consistent with fluorophores attached to a 25 - nm antibody complex that coats the top of a dome . The small dif - ferences between fluorescence and TEM data in yz results from errors discussed above as well as possible drying effects from the TEM preparation . We attribute the low registration error to the thin fixed sample adhered to the coverslip for both iPALM imaging and TEM preparation . After validating our method with clathrin , we applied it to the endocytic protein epsin 1 . Epsin binds clathrin , the lipid phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate , ubiquitinated cargo , eps15 homology domains and the adaptor complex AP2 , and it has been proposed to generate membrane curvature , facilitate vesicle scis - sion , traffic ubiquitinated cargo and regulate actin 8 , 12 – 16 . With such diverse functions under discussion , it is unclear how epsin functions in endocytosis . Epsin is highly colocalized with clathrin in live cells when examined by diffraction - limited fluorescence microscopy ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Understanding the physical location of epsin within clathrin structures at the nanometer scale would help to unravel epsin’s role in endocytosis . In 2D correlative images for the CCSs ( n = 327 ) observed in three cells , AF647 - labeled epsin 1 ( epsin - AF647 ) appeared at the outer perimeter of most structures ( 81 % ) , including both flat structures and highly curved pits ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Figs . 5 and 6 ) . There were , however , cases ( 18 % ) in which epsin was distinctly found at the center . Less than 1 % of CCSs had no detectable epsin - AF647 . Because epsin - AF647 was often visible as less than five puncta per structure , it was necessary to average the signals in order to assess the 2D probability density for 159 slightly domed ( or flat ; Fig . 3b ) and 84 highly domed ( Fig . 3c ) structures , as we previously did for clathrin . We compared the aver - age probability density map for epsin to that of clathrin for short and tall structures ( Fig . 3d ) . In both cases , the fluorescence from epsin - AF647 dipped lower in the center and reached its maximum further from the center than did the fluorescence from clathrin - AF647 . This confirms the visual analysis that epsin is statistically concentrated at the perimeter of CCSs in the xy plane . Control experiments using two - color PALM ( or dSTORM ) imaging of clathrin – Atto 488 and epsin - AF647 in intact versus ‘unroofed’ cells ( the latter having the upper cell membrane removed for visualization of the inner plasma membrane ) demonstrated that our protein locations were not changed during our unroofing prep - aration or correlative imaging pipeline ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Epsin could also be labeled with a photoconvertible fluorescent protein such as mEos3 ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) , but observing the native protein and the higher resolution afforded by the brighter AF647 make it superior for statistical analysis . We constructed tomograms ( Supplementary Videos 4 and 5 ) and analyzed the position of epsin - AF647 in the z dimension ( Fig . 3e ) . Strikingly , the position of epsin - AF647 with respect to CCSs in the z dimension looks similar to that of clathrin - AF647 . This indicates that epsin is not located exclusively at the base of CCSs but instead samples the entire height of the CCSs during all stages of endocytosis . To illustrate this , we created 3D isosurface models of TEM tomograms and epsin - AF647 iPALM renderings ( Fig . 3f – h and Supplementary Video 6 ) . These models show that although the fluorescence is at the outer perimeter of CCSs in the xy plane , it appears anywhere along the height of clathrin pits . Our data provide a map of proteins at single endocytic structures and help form models of these proteins’ functions . For example , epsin has been suggested to induce curvature of a b c 0 50 100 150 Distance from center A v e r age no r m a li z ed fl uo r e sc en c e d e f g h D i s t an c e f r o m p l a s m a m e m b r ane , z ( n m ) 1 . 0 0 0 . 5 0 r 2 r 1 . 0 0 0 . 5 0 100 0 100 figure 3 | Location of epsin 1 in clathrin - coated structures .

We show that epsin 1 is enriched and depleted in regions of equivalent curvature ( the edge and center of flat CCSs , or the side and top of clathrin pits ) . Our data also contradict previous suggestions that epsin is part of the complex located at the bottom rim of CCSs 13 , 16 .

Gold nanorods ( 25 × 45 nm , part # A12 - 25 - 650 , Nanopartz ) were deposited on the surface of poly ( l - lysine ) ( Sigma ) - coated 25 - mm round coverslips of # 1 . 5 thickness ( Warner Instruments ) . SiO 2 ( ~ 20 nm thick ) was sputtered over top of the nanorods using a Denton Explorer sputtering system ( Denton Vacuum ) . These coverslips were cleaned and coated with poly ( l - lysine ) before the cells were plated . Cell culture and transfection . PC12 - GR5 cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 in T75 flasks ( Sarsdtedt 83 - 1813 - 002 ) in dye - free DMEM ( Life Technologies 21063 - 029 ) supplemented with 5 % FBS and 5 % horse serum . This line recently tested negative for mycoplasma contamination . Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) and 2 µ g of plasmid after 1 d of growth on coverslips . The myristoylated psCFP2 expression constructed was made by PCR amplification of the psCFP2 gene ( Evrogen ) , including the mammalian codon - optimized myristoylation signal peptide from the SRC gene : MGSSKSKPKDPSQRRNNN . The amplicon was subsequently cloned into the empty N1 mammalian expression vector ( Clontech ) using the BglII ( 5 ′ ) and NotI ( 3 ′ ) restriction sites . pEGFPC1 - Epsin1 was obtained from Addgene ( # 22228 ) . pmCherryC1 - Epsin1 and pmEos3 - Epsin1 were both made by replacing EGFP from pEGFPC1 - Epsin1 with mCherry ( Clontech # 632524 ) or mEos3 ( ref . 19 ) using Age1 and BsrG1 . For live imaging , cells were transfected with 1 µ g each of pEGFP - LCa ( clathrin light chain A ) 20 and pmCherryC1 - Epsin1 . Unroofing . One day after transfection , cells were rinsed with imaging buffer ( 130 mM NaCl , 2 . 8 mM KCl , 5 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM HEPES , 10 mM glucose , pH 7 . 4 ) , briefly incu - bated in one part stabilization buffer ( 70 mM KCl , 30 mM HEPES at pH 7 . 4 , 5 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM DTT ) and three parts 0 . 01 % ( w / v ) poly ( l - lysine ) for 10 – 15 s , and then incubated for 10 – 15 s three times in a fresh solution made of one part stabiliza - tion buffer and three parts water . The coverslips were then placed in stabilization buffer containing fixative ( 2 % paraformaldehyde and 0 . 04 % glutaraldehyde , Electron Microscopy Sciences ) imme - diately before sonication . Sonication was done with a Branson Sonifier 450 with a 1 / 8” tapered microtip . The tip was positioned 5 mm above the coverslip , and a single 400 - ms pulse at the lowest output setting resulted in approximately 1 cm 2 of unroofed cells on the coverslip . The cells were then placed into fresh stabilization buffer and fixed for 20 min . Immunolabeling . Fixed unroofed cells were rinsed with PBS and placed into blocking buffer ( PBS with 3 % ( w / v ) bovine serum albumin , BSA ) for 1 h . The unroofed cells were then incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer containing 2 µ g / mL primary antibody ( R - 20 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , or X22 , Thermo Scientific ) . The sample was rinsed with blocking buffer before secondary antibody labeling for 30 min ( 2 µ g / mL Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti - goat , Invitrogen A31571 ; Alexa Fluor donkey anti - mouse , Invitrogen A21447 ; or Atto 488 donkey anti - mouse ) in blocking buffer . Atto 488 donkey anti - mouse was created with Atto 488 NHS ester ( Sigma , 4 - molar excess ) and unlabeled donkey anti - mouse IgG ( Abcam ab6707 ) and purified through a Superdex 75 10 / 300 GL size - exclusion column ( GE Healthcare ) . Finally , the sample was washed with blocking buffer and PBS and was post - fixed for 20 min . For immunolabeling intact cells , 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 was added to the blocking buffer , and cells were incubated for 2 min in permeabilization buffer ( PBS with 3 % ( w / v ) BSA , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ) before blocking . iPALM . After immunolabeling , cells were rinsed , placed in blink - ing buffer ( 50 mM Tris , 10 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 g / mL glucose , 0 . 8 mg / mL glucose oxidase , 40 µ g / mL catalase , 71 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol ) and covered with an 18 - mm # 1 . 5 coverslip . The two coverslips were sealed with epoxy ( Elmer’s ) and Vaseline ( Unilever ) . iPALM was performed as previously described 6 with the z - axis mea - surement range extended to 750 nm ( ref . 3 ) . Typical iPALM data acquisition consisted of 40 , 000 – 80 , 000 frames acquired with iXon DU - 897E EM - CCD cameras ( Andor ) . Acquisition was performed in frame transfer mode , and the laser excitation was constantly active during acquisition . AF647 was imaged with a 637 - nm MRL - III - 640 laser ( OptoEngine ) at ~ 3 , 000 W / cm 2 with 20 - to 30 - ms exposure using LP02 - 647RU and FF01 - 720 / SP filters . psCFP2 was imaged with 488 - nm Cyan 488 laser excitation ( Newport , Spectra Physics ) at ~ 400 W / cm 2 with 50 - ms exposure using LP02 - 488RS and FF01 - 520 / 35 filters . An additional quad notch filter NF01 - 405 / 488 / 561 / 635 was used for all imaging . Filters were from Semrock . The iPALM calibration procedure and data analysis have been previously described 3 , 6 , 21 . Two - channel iPALM image registration was performed using Au nanoparticles . The same nanoparticles were observed under 647 - nm illumination and 488 - nm illumina - tion , which allowed for registration of two channels 3 . Images of iPALM data were rendered as previously described 1 , 6 . After iPALM imaging of several areas ( each containing 1 – 3 unroofed cells ) , a 3 - mm circle was etched into the coverslip around the area with a diamond objective marker ( # 11505059 , Leica Microsystems ) . The entire area was imaged with 10× dif - ferential interference contrast ( DIC ) . The image was used as a map to locate cells in TEM . The coverslip sandwich was separated , and the sample was placed in HBSS ( Hanks’ balanced salt solution , Life Technologies ) containing 2 % glutaraldehyde at 4 °C overnight . Electron microscopy . Samples were critical - point dried and were coated with platinum and carbon as previously described 22 . The coated samples were imaged with 10× phase contrast light microscopy to locate the regions of interest ( ROIs ) . A pioloform and carbon – coated 50 - mesh , 3 - mm copper grid was plasma discharged and dipped in a 1 : 5 dilution of goat anti - mouse 10 - nm immunogold conjugate ( EM . GMTA10 , BBinternational ) , rinsed and dried on filter paper . This resulted in sparsely scattered gold nanoparticles that were used as fiducials for tomogram alignment . The platinum - carbon replica was lifted off of the coverslip by floating the sample on 5 % hydrofluoric acid . The replicas were rinsed using successive dilutions with water , lifted out of the water and placed onto the grid using a Perfect Loop ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . The replica was again imaged with 10× phase contrast light microscopy to find the placement of the ROIs with respect to the grid . In some cases , there was loss of a ROI because it was placed over a grid bar . TEM was performed on a JEOL 1400 running SerialEM free - ware 17 and equipped with a XR - 111 CCD camera ( Advanced n p g © 201 4 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c .

Single - axis tilt series ( −60° to 60° , 1° increments ) were collected at 8 , 000× . The montages were stitched together , and the tilt series were reconstructed into tomograms using IMOD software 17 , 18 . Correlation . The 25 × 45 – nm gold nanorods were identified in TEM micrographs . The procedure used for two - color PALM alignment 3 was also used to register two - color PALM images to the TEM images . For image correlations we used a POLYWARP1 image transformation defined as ′ = + ⋅ + ⋅ + ⋅ ⋅ ′ = + ⋅ + ⋅ + ⋅ X K K X K Y K X Y Y K K X K Y K X x x x x y y y y 00 01 10 11 00 01 10 11 ⋅⋅ Y where X and Y are the PALM gold coordinates being transformed to the TEM gold coordinates , X ′ and Y ′ . K coefficients were calculated with a least - squared solution . After xy PALM data were aligned to the 2D TEM data , the 10 - nm gold nanospheres were used as markers to align the 2D TEM / iPALM correlation to the 3D tomogram ( in the xy plane ) using linear regression or POLYWARP1 . z alignment was per - formed by manually aligning the membrane iPALM marker with the membrane in TEM tomograms across the entire tomogram . Fluorescence probability density maps . 2D EM micrographs were analyzed in ImageJ 23 , and elliptical regions of r x and r y ( radii along the x and y axes ) were drawn to best fit the shape of visible clathrin lattices . Clathrin structures were split into two categories : ( i ) flat or slightly curved domes and ( ii ) highly invaginated pits . Clathrin structures were omitted from this analysis only if they were at the edge of the cell , did not fit well to an ellipse , were within 0 . 5 µ m of a gold nanorod or were right next to another clathrin structure . In Matlab ( MathWorks ) , the coordinates of PALM localizations were mapped onto the coordinates of the ellipses and assigned a fractional position from −2 r x to 2 r x in the x dimension and −2 r y to 2r y in the y dimension . The fractional coordinates from each ellipse were binned into a 40 × 40 2D his - togram . The resulting image was normalized before the images from all regions of a specific category were averaged ( Figs . 2e , f and 3b , c ) . Radial scans were produced by averaging pixels on the basis of their distance away from the center of the image . The standard error of pixel sampling takes into account the total number of pixels included in the final data point ( from each sepa - rate 2D histogram ) . Geometric modeling . Fluorescence density maps were simulated in Matlab for two geometries : a hemisphere and a flat disk . We produced 2D projections ( on a 1 - nm grid ) of these objects with radius r = 50 nm and a uniform shell of signal extending from their surfaces by 25 nm ( accounting for the immunotether ) . The resulting image was convolved with Gaussians of variable widths . The width best simulating our data was σ = 16 nm . The final image was resampled to have 10 - nm pixels ( to simulate the fluo - rescence density maps produced by our data ) . z - axis histograms . The height of each structure was determined by selecting the local plasma membrane plane and the top of the clathrin structure in TEM tomograms . A 1D histogram of the z position of all iPALM localizations associated with each structure was mapped with respect to the TEM coordinates . Finally , histo - grams were aligned by their bottom TEM coordinate ( the plasma membrane ) and arranged in order of height ( Figs . 2i and 3e ) . Two - color localization microscopy ( for Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Unroofed cells were prepared as for correlative microscopy . Intact cells were rinsed with imaging buffer and fixed with 2 % parafor - maldehyde . Immunolabeling clathrin heavy chain with Atto 488 and epsin 1 with AF647 is described above . Fixed and immu - nolabeled cells were placed in blinking buffer and imaged with a Nikon N - STORM super - resolution microscope system ( N - 1245 ) equipped with a CFI SR Apochromat TIRF 100× oil objective , an 80 - mW 488 - nm laser , a 125 - mW 647 - nm laser and an Andor Ixon Ultra DU - 897 camera . Two - color images were acquired in TIRF at full laser power with 20 - ms frames . Final super - resolution images were localizations from 20 , 000 – 30 , 000 frames ( each color ) . AFM . Tapping - mode AFM images of clean coverslips were obtained in air with a multimode atomic force microscope driven by a NanoScope V controller and E scanner ( Veeco / Bruker ) using AC160TS cantilevers ( Olympus ) with a typical resonance fre - quency of 300 kHz and a nominal spring constant of 42 N / m . Images were analyzed using NanoScope software ( version 7 ) . Live TIRF . Cells were grown on poly ( l - lysine ) - coated 25 - mm round coverslips of # 1 . 5 thickness ( Warner Instruments ) and transfected with pEGFP - LCa ( clathrin light chain A ) 20 and pmCherryC1 - Epsin1 . Cells were imaged by total - internal - reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) in imaging buffer as described previously 22 . Each image shown is an average of five subsequent 100 - ms frames each 500 ms apart . 19 . Zhang , M . et al . Nature Methods 9 , 727 – 729 ( 2012 ) . 20 .
