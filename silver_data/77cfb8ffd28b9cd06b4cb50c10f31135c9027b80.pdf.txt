Can LLMs Correct Physicians , Yet ? Investigating Effective Interaction Methods in the Medical Domain Burcu Sayin 1 , Pasquale Minervini 2 , Jacopo Staiano 1 , Andrea Passerini 1 1 DISI , University of Trento , name . surname @ unitn . it 2 School of Informatics , University of Edinburgh , p . minervini @ ed . ac . uk Abstract We explore the potential of Large Language Models ( LLMs ) to assist and potentially correct physicians in medical decision - making tasks . We evaluate several LLMs , including Meditron , Llama2 , and Mistral , to analyze the ability of these models to interact effectively with physi - cians across different scenarios . We consider questions from PubMedQA ( Jin et al . , 2019 ) and several tasks , ranging from binary ( yes / no ) responses to long answer generation , where the answer of the model is produced after an inter - action with a physician . Our findings suggest that prompt design significantly influences the downstream accuracy of LLMs and that LLMs can provide valuable feedback to physicians , challenging incorrect diagnoses and contribut - ing to more accurate decision - making . For ex - ample , when the physician is accurate 38 % of the time , Mistral can produce the correct an - swer , improving accuracy up to 74 % depend - ing on the prompt being used , while Llama2 and Meditron models exhibit greater sensitivity to prompt choice . Our analysis also uncovers the challenges of ensuring that LLM - generated suggestions are pertinent and useful , emphasiz - ing the need for further research in this area . 1 Introduction Recent advancements demonstrate Large Language Models’ ( LLMs ) effectiveness in medical AI appli - cations , notably in diagnosis and clinical support systems ( Sutton et al . , 2020 ) . Studies reveal their proficiency in answering diverse medical inquiries with high precision ( Nori et al . , 2023a , b ; Tang et al . , 2023 ; Nazary et al . , 2023 ; Dai et al . , 2023 ; Wang et al . , 2023 ; Chen et al . , 2023c ; Liu et al . , 2023 ; Liévin et al . , 2023 ; Chen et al . , 2023a , b ; Liévin et al . , 2023 ) , emphasizing the importance of tailored prompt design ( Nori et al . , 2023b ) , and advanced prompting techniques for complex tasks ( Tang et al . , 2023 ) . Despite their potential , there are still challenges in deploying LLMs in the clinical domain ( Salvagno et al . , 2023 ; Azamfirei et al . , 2023 ; Alkaissi and McFarlane , 2023 ; Ji et al . , 2023 ) . Furthermore , existing works evaluate the quality of the standalone LLM , while we are inter - ested in the setting where the LLM is supporting a human decision - maker . In many high - stakes medi - cal scenarios , human experts ( e . g . , physicians ) are responsible for making final decisions , and they can seek assistance from AI agents : understanding how AI systems and experts can interact is essential for ensuring their practical utility and reliability . We aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the accu - racy of LLMs in medical and clinical tasks when interacting with a domain expert ( i . e . , a physician ) . For the sake of simplicity , we consider the setting where the LLM is asked to answer a question after a domain expert verbalizes their opinion . We exam - ine whether LLMs avoid challenging expert inputs , potentially affecting response quality . Through empirical tests , we assess LLMs’ ability to rec - tify expert errors while maintaining collaboration , analyzing the impact of expert performance and prompt design on optimizing the performance in clinical decision - making . Our study presents two main contributions . First , we introduce a binary PubMedQA ( Jin et al . , 2019 ) dataset featuring plausible correct and incorrect explanations generated by GPT4 . Second , we high - light the importance of prompt design in enhancing LLM interactions with medical experts , showing its influence on LLMs’ ability to correct physician errors , explain medical reasoning , adapt based on physician input , and ultimately improve LLM per - formance . 2 Methodology 2 . 1 Prompt Design Our analysis focuses on evaluating LLM per - formance in medical question - answering tasks with and without a physician answer and / or 1 a r X i v : 2403 . 20288v1 [ c s . C L ] 29 M a r 2024 a corresponding explanation provided in the prompt . Given the well - known LLMs’ sensitiv - ity to prompts and the potential impact of the order of few - shot examples on output quality ( Bhavya et al . , 2022 ) , we explore several in - context learning scenarios and human expert - LLM interactions . Figure 1 depicts our prompt template . We first explain the task instructions to the LLM ( see Ap - pendix A ) . Then , we present simulated conversa - tions between the physician and the LLM ( see Ap - pendix B ) , with the order of examples varying de - pending on the scenario . The prompt concludes with the test input , including a specific question , context , and the physician’s answer . 2 . 2 Use Cases We focus on binary classification tasks and con - sider the medical questions with a binary response , investigating the following experimental settings : Baseline A plain question - answering ( QA ) set - ting , with no input from the physician . Case 1 The physician provides a binary ( “yes / no” ) answer to the prompt question . We ex - amine four distinct cases : ( Case 1a ) : The physician is always right ; ( Case 1b ) : The physician is always wrong ; ( Case 1c ) : The physician always answers “yes” ; ( Case 1d ) : The physician always answers “no” . Case 2 The physician complements the binary answer with a textual explanation . We use the GPT - 4 APIs , 1 to generate plausible correct and incorrect explanations for each test example ( see Appendix C ) . We replicate the same scenarios as in Case 1 ( a / b / c / d ) , enriching the prompts with the physi - cian’s explanation . For instance , in Case 2a , the physician always provides the correct “yes / no” an - swer and a plausible correct explanation generated by GPT - 4 . In Case 2c , the physician always re - sponds “yes” , together with a plausible correct or incorrect explanation generated by GPT - 4 depend - ing on whether the correct answer to the question is “yes” or “no” . Case 3 The physician provides a ( binary ) correct answer with a certain probability . We simulate physicians with different expertise by varying the probability p of providing a correct answer , with p ∈ { 70 % , 75 % , 80 % , 85 % , 90 % , 95 % } . 1 Precisely , we used the gpt - 4 - 32k model .

Q2 : Can LLMs explain the reasons behind their answers ? Q3 : Can LLMs correct physicians when they provide arguments for their answers ? Q4 : Can LLMs fed with physician answers outperform both themselves and physicians ? 3 . 1 Dataset We use the PubMedQA dataset ( Jin et al . , 2019 ) , an established biomedical QA dataset sourced from PubMed abstracts . The task is to answer biomedical questions with “yes / no / maybe” con - sidering the given PubMed abstracts . We cre - ated a binary version of the task by taking the pubmed _ qa _ labeled _ fold0 _ source subset from the HuggingFace dataset 2 , and discarding the ( few ) “maybe” instances , yielding 445 test examples ( 62 % of class “yes” ) . We fed this binary dataset as input into GPT - 4 , asking it to produce plausible correct and incorrect long answers for each question so as to emulate physicians’ explanations ( Case 2 ) . We made this dataset publicly available 3 and provide further de - tails in Appendix C . 3 . 2 Models & Frameworks We use Meditron - 7B ( Chen et al . , 2023a , b ) , Llama2 - 7B chat ( Touvron et al . , 2023 ) , and Mistral - 7B - Instruct ( Jiang et al . , 2023 ) models . We conduct our experiments via Harness Framework ( Gao et al . , 2023 ) .

For instance , in Case 1d the physician always responds with “no” while the ground truth distribution of class “no” is just 38 % : Mistral achieves significantly higher accu - racy , while Llama2 and Meditron exhibit greater sensitivity to prompt changes , displaying improved performance in Scenarios 1 and 4 . A2 : LLMs could explain reasons behind their answers In examining the detailed responses from each model in Case 1 , we observed that the quality of Meditron’s explanations exhibits mini - mal sensitivity to the physician’s short answer ( see Table 2 ) . Llama2 model typically yields lower ROUGE - L scores in cases 1a ( the physician is always right ) and 1c ( the physician always says “yes” ) . Conversely , the Mistral model consistently delivers better explanations in Scenario 4 for cases b , c , and d . Overall , results show that LLMs are capable of generating plausible explanations when the prompt is constructively framed .

Table 3 re - veals that LLMs exhibit a tendency to heavily rely on physicians when they argument their answers , depending on the few - shot samples provided in - context : Meditron achieves 100 % accuracy on Case 2a , Scenario 4 , where the physician consistently provides the ground truth short answer along with a plausible correct explanation . This indicates Med - itron’s inclination to prioritize the last examples in the prompt , as evidenced by its superior perfor - mance in Scenario 2 and Scenario 4 . Conversely , in Case 2b , where the physician consistently offers the opposite of the ground truth short answer and a plausible incorrect explanation , Meditron exhibits better performance in Scenario 1 and Scenario 3 . Notably , Meditron learns to contradict the physi - cian in Scenario 1 and Scenario 3 for Case 2c and Case 2d , while it learns to agree with the physician in Scenario 2 and Scenario 4 . Another noteworthy observation is that LLama2 tends to over - rely on the physician across all cases and scenarios when the physician provides an argument for their an - swer . In contrast , Mistral demonstrates a more robust performance than Meditron and LLama2 , and appears the least impacted by prompt varia - tions , showcasing over 75 % accuracy in Case 2d across every scenario . This suggests its ability to effectively correct physicians when they provide an incorrect answer and an argument . 3 GroundTruth Med Ll2 Mis 1a - 3 Anassociationwasfoundbetweensublingualvaricesandhy - pertension .

D - Table 7 ) . Con - versely , Meditron appears to excessively depend on the physician’s input , significantly impacting the quality of its explanations . Table 5 illustrates this with an example question and the extended re - sponses from each model . Meditron tends to alter its explanations in response to the physician’s input , while Llama2 and Mistral exhibit greater consis - tency , offering reasonable explanations regardless of the physician’s stance . A4 : LLMs improve with expert answers but fail to outperform them Table 6 presents the results for Case 3 . Interestingly , the baseline performance of the models remains relatively consistent across different scenarios . Consistent with our observa - tions from Case 1 and Case 2 , trends in Case 3 are discernible . Meditron exhibits enhanced perfor - mance in Scenario 2 and Scenario 4 , yet it surpasses its baseline performance solely in Scenario 2 when the physician achieves an accuracy of over 80 % . LLama2 surpasses its baseline in all scenarios when the physician attains an accuracy exceeding 85 % . In contrast , Mistral demonstrates poor performance in Case 3 , being notably influenced by the physi - cian’s answer in each scenario . Overall , while these 7B models , when fed with physician answers , show improved performance over their baseline , they do not outperform the physician themselves . We fur - ther investigated if the 70B version of the mod - els fed with physician answers could outperform both alone , obtaining even worse results when em - ploying the same prompts ( see App . E - Table 8 ) . This indicates that larger models do not necessarily yield better performance ; indeed , Gramopadhye et al . ( 2024 ) recently showed how the LLama2 - 70B model achieved less than 55 % accuracy on the MEDQA dataset ( Jin et al . , 2021 ) , another medical question answering benchmark featuring questions with multiple options . The reasonable hypothesis that prompt modifications might boost performance of 70B models falls outside the scope of this work . 5 Conclusion and Future Work Our experimental results reveal several key insights . Firstly , prompt design significantly impacts LLM performance , with models demonstrating sensitiv - ity to prompt variations yet effectively correcting erroneous physician responses with appropriate in - structions and examples . For instance , Mistral achieved robust accuracy across all scenarios in Case 1d . Secondly , LLMs exhibit the ability to ex - plain answers , under the condition that the prompt used is carefully designed . Thirdly , LLMs tend to rely on physicians when they provide arguments for their answers , and are particularly influenced by the order of few shot examples . Meditron is highly affected by prompt variations , while LLama2 tends to over - rely on the physician . Mistral demonstrates robust performance , indicating resilience to prompt variations . Finally , in Case 3 , while Meditron and LLama2 surpass their baselines in specific scenar - ios , Mistral’s performance is notably influenced by the physician’s answer . Larger 70B models do not guarantee improved performance , highlighting the importance of prompt design and the need for further investigation . 4 References H . Alkaissi and S . I .

A retrospective review was performed on 52 cases with a histologic diagnosis of acute chorioamnionitis from 2 , 051 deliveries at University Hospital , Newark , from January 2003 to July 2003 . Third - trimester placentas without histologic chorioamnionitis ( n = 52 ) served as controls . Cases and controls were selected sequentially . Maternal medical records were reviewed for indicators of maternal infection . Histologic chorioamnionitis was significantly associated with the usage of antibiotics ( p = 0 . 0095 ) and a higher mean white blood cell count ( p = 0 . 018 ) . The presence of 1 or more clinical indicators was significantly associated with the presence of histologic chorioamnionitis ( p = 0 . 019 ) . , Question : Does histologic chorioamnionitis correspond to clinical chorioamnionitis ? # # # Assistant : Answer : yes Explanation : Histologic chorioamnionitis is a reliable indicator of infection whether or not it is clinically apparent . # # # User : Context : Complex regional pain syndrome type I is treated symptomatically . A protective effect of vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) has been reported previously . A dose - response study was designed to evaluate its effect in patients with wrist fractures . In a double - blind , prospective , multicenter trial , 416 patients with 427 wrist fractures were randomly allocated to treatment with placebo or treatment with 200 , 500 , or 1500 mg of vitamin C daily for fifty days . The effect of gender , age , fracture type , and cast - related complaints on the occurrence of complex regional pain syndrome was analyzed . Three hundred and seventeen patients with 328 fractures were randomized to receive vitamin C , and ninety - nine patients with ninety - nine fractures were randomized to receive a placebo . The prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome was 2 . 4 % ( eight of 328 ) in the vitamin C group and 10 . 1 % ( ten of ninety - nine ) in the placebo group ( p = 0 . 002 ) ; all of the affected patients were elderly women . Analysis of the different doses of vitamin C showed that the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome was 4 . 2 % ( four of ninety - six ) in the 200 - mg group ( relative risk , 0 . 41 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0 . 13 to 1 . 27 ) , 1 . 8 % ( two of 114 ) in the 500 - mg group ( relative risk , 0 . 17 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0 . 04 to 0 . 77 ) , and 1 . 7 % ( two of 118 ) in the 1500 - mg group ( relative risk , 0 . 17 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0 . 04 to 0 . 75 ) . Early cast - related complaints predicted the development of complex regional pain syndrome ( relative risk , 5 . 35 ; 95 % confidence interval , 2 . 13 to 13 . 42 ) . , Question : Can vitamin C prevent complex regional pain syndrome in patients with wrist fractures ? # # # Assistant : Answer : yes Explanation : Vitamin C reduces the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome after wrist fractures . A daily dose of 500 mg for fifty days is recommended . 10 Few shot examples for ground truth ‘no’ used in baseline experiments # # # User : Context : Cancer of the buccal mucosa is an uncommon and aggressive neoplasm of the oral cavity . Less than 2 % of patients treated for cancer of the oral cavity at Roswell Park Cancer Institute ( RPCI ) from 1971 to 1997 had primary buccal cancers . Because the majority of these patients did not undergo any adjuvant treatment , this group provided us with the opportunity to assess the relationship between margin status and local recurrence for both small ( T1 - T2 ) and large ( T3 - T4 ) tumors treated with surgery alone . The RPCI tumor registry database reported 104 patients who were treated for buccal carcinoma . A retrospective chart review identified 27 patients who met our criteria for a buccal mucosal primary tumor ( epicenter of the mass in the buccal mucosa ) . There were 13 men and 14 women , ranging in age from 34 to 94 years ( mean , 75 ) . Data were collected regarding patient demographics , presenting symptoms , stage , treatment received , and outcome . All patients underwent surgical resection of their primary lesion ; 21 ( 75 % ) had T1 or T2 tumors . The rate of local recurrence was 56 % for the group as a whole . Patients with close or positive margins had a 66 % local failure rate as compared with 52 % when surgical margins were negative ( greater than or equal to 5 mm from the resection margin after tissue fixation ; P = ns ) . Among those in whom negative margins were achieved , patients with T1 - T2 disease had a 40 % local failure rate with surgical resection alone . , Question : Cancer of the buccal mucosa : are margins and T - stage accurate predictors of local control ? # # # Assistant : Answer : no Explanation : Local excision of T1 and T2 buccal mucosa cancers with pathologically negative margins had a high rate of local recurrence in our series . Low T - stage and negative margins are not adequate predictors of local control . Even early buccal tumors may benefit from adjuvant therapy to enhance local control . # # # User : Context : To be able to adhere to discharge instructions after a visit to the emergency department ( ED ) , patients should understand both the care that they received and their discharge instructions . The objective of this study is to assess , at discharge , patients’ comprehension of their ED care and instructions and their awareness of deficiencies in their comprehension . We conducted structured interviews of 140 adult English - speaking patients or their primary caregivers after ED discharge in 2 health systems . Participants rated their subjective understanding of 4 domains : ( 1 ) diagnosis and cause ; ( 2 ) ED care ; ( 3 ) post - ED care , and ( 4 ) return instructions . We assessed patient comprehension as the degree of agreement ( concordance ) between patients’ recall of each of these domains and information obtained from chart review . Two authors scored each case independently and discussed discrepancies before providing a final concordance rating ( no concordance , minimal concordance , partial concordance , near concordance , complete concordance ) . Seventy - eight percent of patients demonstrated deficient comprehension ( less than complete concordance ) in at least 1 domain ; 51 % of patients , in 2 or more domains . Greater than a third of these deficiencies ( 34 % ) involved patients’ understanding of post - ED care , whereas only 15 % were for diagnosis and cause . The majority of patients with comprehension deficits failed to perceive them . Patients perceived difficulty with comprehension only 20 % of the time when they demonstrated deficient comprehension . , Question : Patient comprehension of emergency department care and instructions : are patients aware of when they do not understand ? # # # Assistant : Answer : no Explanation : Many patients do not understand their ED care or their discharge instructions . Moreover , most patients appear to be unaware of their lack of understanding and report inappropriate confidence in their comprehension and recall . 11 Few shot examples for ground truth ‘yes’ used in Case 1 # # # User : Context : To evaluate the degree to which histologic chorioamnionitis , a frequent finding in placentas submitted for histopathologic evaluation , correlates with clinical indicators of infection in the mother .

This suggests a correlation between histologic chorioamnionitis and clinical chorioamnionitis . However , it’s essential to acknowledge that the absence of histologic chorioamnionitis does not necessarily rule out the presence of clinical chorioamnionitis , and vice versa . Clinical manifestations of chorioamnionitis can vary , and histologic examination may not always capture the full spectrum of the condition . Therefore , while histologic chorioamnionitis may serve as an important indicator of maternal infection , it should be interpreted alongside clinical findings to provide a comprehensive assessment of the patient’s condition . } # # # Assistant : { " Answer " : yes , " Explanation " : Histologic chorioamnionitis is a reliable indicator of infection whether or not it is clinically apparent . } 14 Second example for ground truth ‘yes’ used in Case 2 # # # User : { " Context " : Complex regional pain syndrome type I is treated symptomatically .

It could be argued , for the sake of discussion , that vitamin C’s effect might be a surrogate for other health - promoting behaviors or factors associated with individuals more likely to take supplements , such as overall better health status , more conscientious health practices , or even a placebo effect driven by patients’ expectations of treatment benefits . This perspective might suggest that the actual reduction in CRPS incidence among the vitamin C - treated groups could be attributed to these confounding factors rather than the biological action of vitamin C itself . Therefore , the correlation between vitamin C supplementation and decreased CRPS prevalence might not imply a causal relationship , challenging the notion that vitamin C can directly prevent CRPS in patients with wrist fractures . } # # # Assistant : { " Answer " : yes , " Explanation " : Vitamin C reduces the prevalence of complex re - gional pain syndrome after wrist fractures .

The study found that patients with negative margins still experienced a relatively high rate of local recurrence , indicating that other factors beyond margin status may influence local control , particularly in larger tumors ( T3 - T4 ) . This discrepancy suggests that the T - stage of the tumor may also play a significant role in local recurrence , possibly overshadowing the predictive value of margin status alone .

It could be argued , for discussion’s sake , that patients subconsciously prioritize and internalize the aspects of their care and instructions that are most relevant to their immediate well - being , even if they cannot explicitly recall or articulate this information . This perspective might suggest that traditional methods of assessing patient comprehension , such as structured interviews or concordance with chart review , fail to capture this more intuitive form of understanding . Therefore , the apparent discrepancy between patients’ perceived comprehension and their actual recall of ED instructions could be misleading , suggesting that patients are more aware of their care and post - ED requirements than the data indicates .

Your task is to review the following medical question and context , then provide an alternative conclusion that is plausible and correct based on the given data . Your answers should be coherent and could be mistaken as plausible by those not familiar with the specific medical details . Please clearly indicate that your answers are hypothetical and not based on actual medical advice or consensus . QUESTION : Does histologic chorioamnionitis correspond to clinical chorioamnionitis ? CONTEXT : To evaluate the degree to which histologic chorioamnionitis , a frequent finding in placentas submitted for histopathologic evaluation , correlates with clinical indicators of infection in the mother . A retrospective review was performed on 52 cases with a histologic diagnosis of acute chorioamnionitis from 2 , 051 deliveries at University Hospital , Newark , from January 2003 to July 2003 . Third - trimester placentas without histologic chorioamnionitis ( n = 52 ) served as controls . Cases and controls were selected sequentially . Maternal medical records were reviewed for indicators of maternal infection . Histologic chorioamnionitis was significantly associated with the usage of antibiotics ( p = 0 . 0095 ) and a higher mean white blood cell count ( p = 0 . 018 ) . The presence of 1 or more clinical indicators was significantly associated with the presence of histologic chorioamnionitis ( p = 0 . 019 ) . SHORT ANSWER ( Correct and plausible ) : Yes . LONG ANSWER ( Correct and plausible ) : The presence of histologic chorioamnionitis appears to be significantly associated with clinical indicators of infection in the mother , such as the usage of antibiotics and a higher mean white blood cell count . This suggests a correlation between histologic chorioamnionitis and clinical chorioamnionitis . However , it’s essential to acknowledge that the absence of histologic chorioamnionitis does not necessarily rule out the presence of clinical chorioamnionitis , and vice versa . Clinical manifestations of chorioamnionitis can vary , and histologic examination may not always capture the full spectrum of the condition . Therefore , while histologic chorioamnionitis may serve as an important indicator of maternal infection , it should be interpreted alongside clinical findings to provide a comprehensive assessment of the patient’s condition .

The presence of 1 or more clinical indicators was significantly associated with the presence of histologic chorioamnionitis ( p = 0 . 019 ) . SHORT ANSWER ( Incorrect but plausible ) : No . LONG ANSWER ( Incorrect but plausible ) : Despite the findings that histologic chorioamnionitis is often associated with clinical indicators of infection , such as antibiotic use and elevated white blood cell counts , an alternative interpretation could suggest that these associations are coincidental rather than causal . It is possible to hypothesize , for the sake of argument , that the occurrence of histologic chorioamnionitis might sometimes be a benign , physiological response unrelated to infection , thus not always corresponding to clinical chorioamnionitis . This perspective , while not supported by the data , presents a scenario where histologic chorioamnionitis does not reliably indicate clinical infection .
