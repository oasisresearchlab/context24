We found that m - opioid neuropeptide receptors signal to their enclosing CCPs by ubiquitination . Nonubiquitinated receptors delay CCPs at an intermediate stage of maturation , after clathrin lattice assembly is complete but before membrane scission . Receptor ubiquitination re - lieves this inhibition , effectively triggering CCP scis - sion and producing a receptor - containing endocytic vesicle . The ubiquitin modiﬁcation that conveys this endocytosis - promoting signal is added to the re - ceptor’s ﬁrst cytoplasmic loop , catalyzed by the Smurf2 ubiquitin ligase , and coordinated with activa - tion - dependent receptor phosphorylation and clus - tering through Smurf2 recruitment by the endocytic adaptor beta - arrestin . Epsin1 detects the signal at the CCP and is required for ubiquitin - promoted scission . This cargo - to - coat communication system mediates a biochemical checkpoint that ensures appropriate receptor ubiquitination for later traf - ﬁcking , and it controls speciﬁc receptor loading into CCPs by sensing when a sufﬁcient quorum is reached . INTRODUCTION Clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) mediate endocytosis of diverse membrane cargoes and are essential for numerous cellular processes , from the uptake of nutrients to the regulation of receptor - mediated signaling . Clathrin - dependent endocytosis involves a precisely orchestrated series of events , subject to regulation at the level of the conserved endocytic machinery and accessory proteins ( Perrais and Merriﬁeld , 2005 ; Toret and Drubin , 2006 ; Traub , 2009 ) . The clathrin - containing lattice pro - motes membrane deformation and captures cargoes through interaction with various adaptors or CLASPs ( Brodsky et al . , 2001 ; Farsad and De Camilli , 2003 ; Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ; Maldonado - Ba´ez and Wendland , 2006 ; McMahon and Gallop , 2005 ; Traub , 2009 ) . CCPs then undergo membrane scission , regulated in animal cells by dynamin ( Taylor et al . , 2012 ) , producing endocytic vesicles . While CCP formation and function are exquisitely regulated ( Kirchhausen , 2009 ; Tay - lor et al . , 2011 ; Weinberg and Drubin , 2011 ) , membrane cargoes packaged in the CCP have been generally viewed as inert passengers . However , it is increasingly clear that some cargoes can inﬂuence the initial formation of CCPs or their subsequent maturation ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Liu et al . , 2010 ; Loerke et al . , 2009 ; Mettlen et al . , 2010 ; Puthenveedu and von Zastrow , 2006 ; Rust et al . , 2004 ) . An interesting , and largely unresolved , question is how such cargo - mediated control is communicated . Cargo control is particularly interesting for signal - transducing receptors that are regulated by CCP - dependent endocytosis . There is already evidence for feedback control of the endocytic pathway at a global level by downstream signaling effectors ( Le Roy and Wrana , 2005 ; Sorkin and von Zastrow , 2009 ) . It is not known if activated receptors can also signal locally to the endo - cytic machinery , effectively exerting direct control over their enclosing CCPs . Two properties of seven - transmembrane receptors ( 7TMRs ) , the largest known family of signaling recep - tors , make them prime candidates for mediating such local modulation . First , many 7TMRs form oligomeric complexes and cluster nonuniformly in CCPs following ligand - induced acti - vation , forming a 7TMR - enriched CCP subset under conditions of endogenous or near - endogenous levels of receptor and adaptor expression ( Cao et al . , 1998 ; Kasai et al . , 2011 ; Khelash - vili et al . , 2010 ; Mundell et al . , 2006 ; Puthenveedu and von Zastrow , 2006 ) . Second , some 7TMRs are already known to engage actin - binding proteins after clustering in CCPs , thereby locally prolonging the surface residence time of 7TMR - containing CCPs before they internalize ( Puthenveedu and von Zastrow , 2006 ) . In addition to this apparently passive cargo - based prolongation of CCP maturation , might some recep - tors locally convey an active endocytosis - promoting signal ? Here , we show that this is indeed the case , and identify an ubiq - uitin - dependent signaling mechanism that regulates endocy - tosis by locally controlling the surface lifetime of receptor - containing CCPs .

RESULTS Ubiquitination Controls the Rate of MOR Endocytosis by CCPs FLAG - tagged mu opioid receptors ( F - MORs ) were basally ubiq - uitinated at a low level , and receptor ubiquitination increased over a period of minutes in response to the opioid receptor agonist DADLE ( Figure 1A , left lanes ) . Mutating all cytoplasmic lysine residues ( F - MOR0cK ) prevented both basal and agonist - induced receptor ubiquitination ( Figures 1A , right lanes ; loading controls in Figures 1B and 1C ) . Blocking F - MOR internalization using K44E mutant dynamin or the dynamin inhibitor Dyngo - 4a did not ( data not shown ) , indicating that MOR ubiquitination can occur prior to endocytosis . Lysine mutation inhibited agonist - induced internalization of receptors but had no effect on the ability of receptors to recycle back to the cell surface ( Figures 1D and 1E ) , and agonist - induced endocytosis of recep - tors remained both clathrin and dynamin - dependent ( Figures 1F – 1I ) . Thus , preventing MOR ubiquitination alters the rate but not mechanism of agonist - induced endocytosis . Ubiquitination Regulates MOR Endocytosis after Receptors Cluster in CCPs Clathrin - dependent endocytosis of 7TMRs in animal cells is initi - ated by arrestin - promoted clustering of activated receptors into preexisting CCPs ( Santini et al . , 2002 ) . Because ubiquitin inter - acts with various endocytic adaptors ( Hicke and Dunn , 2003 ; Shih et al . , 2002 ; Torrisi et al . , 1999 ; Toshima et al . , 2009 ) , we expected lysine mutation to impair the clustering step but this was not the case . Total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence micros - copy ( TIR - FM ) indicated that both F - MORs and F - MOR0cKs were diffusely distributed in the plasma membrane in the absence of agonist and clustered into diffraction - limited spots after agonist application ( Figure 2A ) , as veriﬁed in our optical system by imaging 50 nm ﬂuorescent beads ( data not shown ) . The time required for clustering after agonist addition was similar for MORs and MOR0cKs ( Figure S1A available online ) . Robust clustering was also observed using a covalent rather than anti - body - based labeling strategy ( Figure S1C ) based on fusion of a pH - sensitive green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) variant ( supere - cliptic pHluorin , or SpH ) whose ﬂuorescence is quenched in en - dosomes ( Miesenbo¨ck et al . , 1998 ) . Diffraction - limited receptor spots observed in agonist - exposed cells were immobile and colocalized with clathrin light chain ( Figure 2B , arrows ) , supporting their identiﬁcation as receptor - containing CCPs ( Puthenveedu and von Zastrow , 2006 ) . TIR - FM analysis was restricted to the ventral plasma membrane , but immunoelectron microscopy revealed clustering of both MORs and MOR0cKs into morphologically characteristic CCPs in the dorsal plasma membrane ( Figure 2C ) . CCPs con - taining both F - MOR and F - MOR0cK were productive because the clathrin coat disappeared from the TIR - FM imaging ﬁeld concomitantly with receptor removal from the plasma membrane ( Figure 2D ; Movie S1 ) . Further , discrete endocytic events , when summed over the imaged surface and time , were sufﬁcient to account for net receptor loss determined by inte - grated receptor ﬂuorescence ( Figures S2A and S2B ) . We also veriﬁed that disappearance of both MOR and MOR0cK clusters was preceded by a characteristic burst of GFP - tagged dynamin - 2 accumulation ( not shown ) . Together these results indicate that both wild - type MOR and ubiquitination - defective MOR0cK undergo regulated endocytosis via the conserved CCP pathway , involving agonist - induced clustering of receptors into CCPs fol - lowed by characteristic dynamin - dependent endocytic scission . CCPs typically undergo scission within seconds after coat assembly is complete ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Merriﬁeld et al . , 2002 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) but CCPs con - taining MORs , in contrast , were consistently found to linger in the plasma membrane . We estimated for each CCP a receptor ‘‘surface lifetime , ’’ deﬁned as the interval between the initial appearance of a diffraction - limited receptor spot ( the frame in which its surface intensity visibly exceeded the plasma mem - brane surround ) and its later abrupt disappearance from the TIR - FM illumination ﬁeld ( indicating endocytic scission ) . Lysine mutation of MORs markedly extended the mean surface lifetime of receptor - containing CCPs ( Figure 2E ) and right - shifted the respective frequency ( Figure 2F ) and cumulative probability ( Fig - ure 2G ) distributions of events . We further veriﬁed this effect using receptors labeled covalently with SpH , to speciﬁcally visu - alize surface receptors without the potential complications of bound antibody ( Figures S2C – S2E ) . Together , these results reveal an unanticipated role of 7TMR ubiquitination in limiting the surface lifetime of CCPs that mediate their endocytosis . Kinetic Control Is Conferred by Agonist - Induced Ubiquitination of the Receptor’s First Cytoplasmic Loop To determine if this effect is dependent on a speciﬁc site of MOR ubiquitination , we reverted lysine residues in individual cyto - plasmic domains in the MOR0cK background ( Figure 3A ) . Restoring only two lysine residues present in the ﬁrst intracellular loop ( MOR0cK R94 , 96K ) fully rescued the endocytic defect , while reverting lysines in any other cytoplasmic domain did not ( Figure 3B ) . Conversely , speciﬁcally preventing ubiquitination in the ﬁrst cytoplasmic loop of MOR ( MOR K94 , 96R ) inhibited agonist - induced endocytosis ( Figure 3C ; Figure S2F ) . Mutating either of the two ﬁrst - loop lysine residues individually produced an intermediate phenotype ( not shown ) , prompting us to focus on dual lysine mutation for subsequent analysis . To determine if ﬁrst - loop lysine residues affect individual CCP dynamics , we compared mutant MORs containing or lack - ing only these residues ( MOR0cK R94 , 96K or MOR K94 , 96R , re - spectively ) . Both clustered robustly in response to DADLE , and with indistinguishable clustering times ( Figure S1B ) . However , CCPs containing MOR K94 , 96Rs exhibited markedly longer ( H ) Toverifyclathrinknockdown , immunoblots detecting endogenousclathrinheavychainwereperformed , andequalloadingwasconﬁrmedbyimmunoblotting for GAPDH .

Thus , lysine residues in the MOR ﬁrst cytoplasmic loop , while not required for the formation of CCPs or robust receptor clus - tering within them , speciﬁcally control the surface lifetime of receptor - containing CCPs before they disappear from the plasma membrane . Ubiquitination of the same cytoplasmic lysine residues promotes topological sorting of MORs from the limiting mem - brane to intralumenal vesicles of late endosomes / multivesicular bodies ( Hislop et al . , 2011 ) . Radioligand binding assay veriﬁed that this proteolytic effect occurs clearly after endocytosis ( Figure 3H ) , and we established biochemically that ﬁrst - loop cytoplasmic lysine residues are major sites of agonist - induced Figure 2 .

Together these results indi - cate that MORs undergo agonist - induced ubiquitination in the ﬁrst cytoplasmic loop , affecting discrete events of receptor endocytosis and postendocytic sorting . MOR Ubiquitination Locally Controls the Maturation of Receptor - Containing CCPs To examine the kinetics of CCPs themselves , we next imaged the formation and disappearance of diffraction - limited spots labeled by DsRed - tagged clathrin light chain ( Merriﬁeld et al . , 2002 ) . In cells not expressing opioid receptors , or in receptor - expressing cells not exposed to opioid agonist , most CCPs labeled in this manner increased in ﬂuorescence intensity over a period of (cid:1) 30 s after their initial appearance and then abruptly disappeared from the evanescent ﬁeld within an additional 5 – 10 s ( Figure 4A , black line shows a representative intensity trace ) . This behavior is consistent with the previously described dynamics of CCPs at 37 (cid:3) C under conditions of near - endoge - nous clathrin expression ( Doyon et al . , 2011 ; Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Merriﬁeld et al . , 2002 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . In cells expressing wild - type MORs and exposed to agonist , we saw the emergence of a subset of clathrin spots with a moderately longer surface lifetime . Mutating lysine resi - dues present in the ﬁrst cytoplasmic loop exaggerated this delay . Examining individual examples indicated that the delay occurred after clathrin intensity reached a near - maximum value ( Figure 4A , blue line shows a representative intensity trace ) , sug - gesting that kinetic control is exerted by receptors after clathrin lattice assembly is complete . Representative TIR - FM imaging series of the range of behav - iors observed , from cells expressing each mutant receptor construct examined , are shown in Figure 4B . We veriﬁed these observations quantitatively across multiple examples and experiments by determining a mean CCP surface lifetime ( Figure 4C ) . Frequency distribution and cumulative probability plots also revealed a pronounced rightward shift in the distribution of clathrin surface lifetimes that was dependent both on the receptor construct expressed and the presence of agonist ( Figures 4D and 4E ) . A similar effect was evident when the same image series was analyzed using a previously described ( Jaqaman et al . , 2008 ) computer algorithm ( Figures S3A and S3B ) . Because various 7TMRs cluster nonuniformly within the CCP population ( Cao et al . , 1998 ; Mundell et al . , 2006 ; Puthenveedu and von Zastrow , 2006 ) , we next asked if the subset of CCPs with prolonged surface lifetime corresponded to those contain - ing activated MORs . To do so , we used dual - label TIR - FM to analyze the CCP lifetime of all diffraction - limited clathrin spots ( representing the overall population of CCPs ) and then separated the individual determinations according to the presence or absence of MOR K94 , 96R ﬂuorescence . Increased mean sur - face lifetime was observed only for the receptor - containing subset ( Figure 4F ) , and the rightward shift in the distribution of surface lifetimes fully segregated with this subset ( Figures 4G and 4H ) . These results suggest that activated opioid receptors locally control CCPs and do so in a manner determined by the receptor’s speciﬁc ubiquitination status . In essence , nonubiqui - tinated MORs act as a ‘‘brake’’ to stall receptor - containing CCPs , while ubiquitination of the receptor’s ﬁrst cytoplasmic loop functions as a ‘‘brake release’’ to trigger subsequent endo - cytic scission . This interpretation predicts that the surface lifetime of another cargo , copackaged with ubiquitin - defective opioid receptors , would also be affected . To test this , we carried out dual - label TIR - FM imaging of mutant opioid receptors together with SpH - tagged transferrin receptors ( SpH - TfRs ) that cluster constitu - tively in CCPs . While many SpH - TfR spots exhibited relatively short surface lifetimes , a subset persisted in the plasma mem - brane for an extended time period before abruptly disappearing from the evanescent ﬁeld ; precisely these spots colocalized with F - MOR K94 , 96R ( Figures 4I – 4K ) . Ubiquitination in the First Cytoplasmic Loop Controls MOR Loading into CCPs First - loop mutations did not detectably affect the peak value of clathrin light chain ﬂuorescence measured before CCP scission visualized by TIR - FM ( Figures 5A – 5C ) . However , a pronounced difference was observed when the same approach was used to quantify the ﬂuorescence of receptors . Preventing MOR ubiquitination in the ﬁrst loop increased mean receptor loading of CCPs estimated at the time of scission ( Figure 5D ) , and produced an obvious right shift in the distribution of individual receptor intensity values ( Figures 5E and 5F ) . We noted a detect - able but smaller ( 30 % – 50 % ) increase in the coefﬁcient of varia - tion of the intensity distribution ( legend to Figure 5E ) , suggesting that preventing MOR ubiquitination also increases variability in the degree of receptor loading into individual CCPs . These observations were further supported by detailed anal - ysis of the relationship between ubiquitin - dependent control of CCP surface lifetime and cargo loading . When ubiquitination of the ﬁrst cytoplasmic loop was allowed to occur ( i . e . , wild - type MOR or MOR0cK R94 , 96K ) , CCP lifetimes were uniformly short and cargo loading ( receptor ﬂuorescence intensity measured at individual CCPs ) was relatively tightly clustered ( Figures 5G and 5H ) . However , when ubiquitination was prevented ( MOR K94 , 96R ) , there was an extended distribution of clathrin lifetimes that positively correlated with cargo load ( Figures 5I and 5J , correlation coefﬁcient = 0 . 69 ) . This suggests that by controlling the surface lifetime of individual CCPs , ubiquitination of MOR’s ﬁrst cytoplasmic loop effectively limits the amount of receptor cargo accumulated into CCPs by the time of endocytic scission . Ubiquitin Is Added to Receptors by Activation and Phosphorylation - Dependent Recruitment of Smurf2 Having established ﬁrst - loop ubiquitination as the critical biochemical information conferring local control of CCP lifetime , we next investigated the mechanism responsible for adding this signal . We started by identifying the relevant ubiquitin ligase . To do so , we screened for effects of catalytic inactivation , focusing on HECT domain ligases related to Rsp5 / Nedd4 because of their widespread endocytic functions and on a subset of RING domain ligases shown previously to function in the endocytic pathway ( Hislop and von Zastrow , 2011 ; Staub and Rotin , 2006 ) . The HECT domain ubiquitin ligase Smurf2 emerged as a strong candidate ( Figure 6A ) , which we pursued further because its effects were highly cargo speciﬁc and evident using both mutational inactivation ( Figure 6B ) and small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) - mediated knockdown ( Figures 6C and 6F ) .

Developmental Cell Cargo Ubiquitination Regulates Clathrin Dynamics 524 Developmental Cell 23 , 519 – 532 , September 11 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . Smurf2 knockdown inhibited internalization of MORs only when lysine residues were present in the ﬁrst loop , whereas it pro - duced no ( additional ) inhibitory effect on MORs lacking lysine residues in the ﬁrst loop ( Figures 6D and 6E ) . Finally , we veriﬁed that speciﬁcally disrupting Smurf2 catalytic activity inhibited agonist - induced ubiquitination of MORs ( Figures 6G and 6H ) . These observations provide independent lines of genetic and biochemical evidence that Smurf2 regulates MOR endocytosis by adding ubiquitin to the ﬁrst cytoplasmic loop . We next asked how Smurf2 - mediated ubiquitination of MORs iscoordinatedwithagonist - inducedreceptoractivationandclus - tering . Smurf2 associated with Arrestin3 ( beta - arrestin2 ) in cell extracts ( Figure 6I ) , and Arrestin3 is already known to undergo agonist - induced recruitment to MORs ( Cen et al . , 2001 ; Johnson et al . , 2006 ; Zhang et al . , 1998 ) . This suggested that Arrestin3 , in addition to functioning as an endocytic adaptor for MORs , might also function as a scaffold for recruiting Smurf2 to agonist - acti - vated MORs . Supporting this hypothesis , both Arrestin3 - GFP and Smurf2 - GFP ﬂuorescence rapidly increased at the plasma membrane after receptor activation , with Smurf2 recruitment following that of Arrestin3 ( Figure 6J , green and purple lines , respectively ) . Further , Smurf2 accumulated both diffusely and in spots in the plasma membrane ( Figure S4 ) reminiscent of Arrestin3 localization shown previously ( Puthenveedu and von Zastrow , 2006 ) , and recruitment of both proteins began before detectable receptor clustering in CCPs ( compare Figure 6J with Figures S1A and S1C ) . Beta - arrestins associate with MORs following agonist - induced phosphorylation of the receptor’s cytoplasmic tail ( Groer et al . , 2011 ; Johnson et al . , 2006 ; Zhang et al . , 1998 ) , and the speciﬁc phosphorylation sites required for this recruitment were recently deﬁned ( Lau et al . , 2011 ) . Mutating only these residues ( F - MOR 375AAANA379 ) blocked agonist - induced ubiquitination of MORs ( Figures 6K and 6L ) . Further , knockdown of Smurf2 effectively phenocopied lysyl - mutation of MORs , as indicated by a signiﬁcant increase in mean receptor surface lifetime ( Figure 7A ) and a pronounced right shift in the frequency distribution ( Figures 7B and 7C ) . Additionally , expres - sionofGFP - tagged , catalyticallyinactivemutantSmurf2resulted in (cid:1) 2 - fold increase in MOR surface lifetime compared to expres - sion of GFP alone ( data not shown ) , similar to the effect of Smurf2 knockdown . These results suggest that Smurf2 - mediated ubiq - uitination of MORs is controlled , and coordinated with receptor clustering in CCPs , through arrestin - mediated recruitment . The Ubiquitin Signal Is Detected at CCPs by Epsin1 To determine how the ubiquitin - encoded signal is detected to transduce local CCP control , we screened CCP - associated proteins that are known to bind ubiquitin . Obvious candidates are epsins , a conserved family of ubiquitin - interacting motif ( UIM ) - containing proteins that assemble with CCPs ( Chen et al . , 1998 ; Kazazic et al . , 2009 ; Shih et al . , 2002 ; Wendland , 2002 ) , and whose knockdown or overexpression can alter CCP dynamics ( Mettlen et al . , 2009 ) or endocytic function ( Chen et al . , 2011 ; Rosenthal et al . , 1999 ; Sorkina et al . , 2006 ; Sugiyama et al . , 2005 ) . siRNA duplexes targeting Epsin2 did not detectably affect MOR internalization ( not shown ) but Epsin1 depletion caused a signiﬁcant inhibition ( Figure S5A ) . We initially rejected this candidate because its knockdown ( Figures S5B and S5C ) and overexpression ( Figures S5D and S5E ) also affected lysyl mutant MORs , consistent with these manipulations of overall Epsin1 abundance causing a general impairment of endocytosis . We later reconsidered this candidate because deleting only the tandem UIMs ( Epsin1 D UIM ) , which disrupts Epsin1 binding to ubiquitinated proteins ( Sugiyama et al . , 2005 ) , did not detectably change Epsin1 distribution or assembly with CCPs ( Figures S5F and S5G ) and affected MOR endocy - tosis in a ubiquitination - speciﬁc manner : Epsin1 D UIM inhibited internalization of the wild - type MOR ( Figure 7D ) but had no detectable effect on internalization of the lysyl mutant MOR0cK , which slows CCP maturation but is unable to undergo the critical ﬁrst - loop ubiquitination ( Figure 7E ) , or of the DOR that does not delay CCP maturation in the ﬁrst place ( Figure 7F ) . Further sup - porting this conclusion , Epsin1 D UIM prolonged surface lifetime of CCPs containing wild - type MORs ( Figure 7G – 7I ) without im - pairing receptor clustering in CCPs initiated by agonist - induced receptor activation ( Figure S1E ) . These results experimentally isolate a speciﬁc function of Epsin1 , through its UIMs , in recog - nizing appropriately ubiquitinated MORs and triggering endo - cytic scission of the CCPs containing them . DISCUSSION The present results show that a signaling receptor that is itself regulated by CCP - mediated endocytosis can , conversely , exert active and local cargo - dependent control over the endocytic process .

Ubiquitination of MORs in the ﬁrst cytoplasmic loop conveys an active biochemical signal that effectively counteracts this inhibitory effect , allowing speciﬁc receptor ubiquitination to act as an endocytic ‘‘brake release . ’’ The present results add to the accumulating evidence supporting cargo - mediated regula - tion at various stages in the conserved CCP pathway ( Ehrlich Figure 4 .

Ubiquitination of endocytic cargoes is well known to promote the initial accumulation in CCPs through ubiquitin - binding endo - cytic adaptors ( Hicke and Dunn , 2003 ; Maldonado - Ba´ez and Wendland , 2006 ; Shih et al . , 2002 ; Torrisi et al . , 1999 ; Toshima et al . , 2009 ) , and to promote later multivesicular body / lysosome sorting of endocytic cargo through interactions with the ESCRT machinery ( Raiborg and Stenmark , 2009 ; Saksena et al . , 2007 ; Shields and Piper , 2011 ) . The present results identify a discrete function of ubiquitin as a biochemical signal that actively controls CCP maturation . Our results add to accumulating evidence for additional endocytic functions of ubiquitin ( Jiang and Sorkin , 2003 ; Reider and Wendland , 2011 ) and , taken in context with recent evidence for ubiquitin - dependent control in the biosyn - thetic pathway ( Jin et al . , 2012 ) , suggest a potentially wide - spread role of ubiquitin as a cargo - speciﬁc regulator of coat protein dynamics . Ubiquitin is added to the receptor by Arrestin3 - dependent recruitment of the Smurf2 ubiquitin ligase , promoted by speciﬁc phosphorylation of the MOR cytoplasmic tail . This mechanism for regulating receptor ubiquitination intrinsically assures close Figure 5 . MOR Ubiquitination Controls the Amount of Receptor Loaded into Individual CCPs .

We are not aware of previous evidence for such a biochemical encoding mechanism for opioid receptors , or for Smurf2 speciﬁcally , but regulation by arrestin - mediated recruitment of ubiquitin ligases is emerging as a repeated theme in cell biology ( Bhandari et al . , 2007 ; Shenoy et al . , 2001 , 2008 ) . The regulatory effect of receptor ubiq - uitination on CCP surface lifetime requires epsin1 , and speciﬁ - cally its UIMs , identifying a discrete function of epsin in sensing and transducing the endocytosis - promoting activity of this local biochemical signal . Ubiquitin - dependent endocytic control appears to mediate a biochemical ‘‘checkpoint’’ that delays endocytosis until appro - priate ubiquitination ( Hislop et al . , 2011 ) of MORs is achieved to facilitate later trafﬁcking ( Figure 7F , red bar ) . We also found that ﬁrst - loop ubiquitination affects MOR density in individual CCPs at the time of endocytic scission ( Figures 5D – 5J ) , suggesting that it represents a simple biochemical mechanism to estimate Figure 6 .

The latter effect is reminiscent of ‘‘quorum sensing’’ ( Miller and Bassler , 2001 ) described initially in bacterial ecology ( Fuqua et al . , 1994 ; Nealson et al . , 1970 ) , except that the pres - ently described density - measurement system is based on local accumulation of covalently attached ubiquitin rather than of a secreted factor ( Fuqua and Greenberg , 1998 ; Hastings and Greenberg , 1999 ; Jayaraman and Wood , 2008 ) . Thus , we propose that the presently identiﬁed cargo - to - coat communica - tion system functions , at the systems level , as a means to funda - mentally and locally tailor the endocytic pathway to the needs of specialized membrane cargoes such as signaling receptors . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Expression Constructs , Reagents , and Statistical Analysis Expression constructs and reagents , as well as statistical methods , are described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Other methods are summarized below , with additional detail included in Supplemental Experi - mental Procedures . Flow Cytometric Analysis of Endocytosis The ﬂow cytometric assay was carried out as previously described ( Hislop et al . , 2011 ; Tsao and von Zastrow , 2000 ) . TIR - FM Imaging TIR - FM was performed at 37 (cid:3) C using a Nikon TE - 2000E inverted microscope with a 60 3 1 . 45 NA TIRF objective , using through - the - objective illumination and 488 nm Argon - ion laser ( Melles Griot ) and 543 nm HeNe laser ( Spectra Physics ) as light sources . An iXon ( Andor ) camera was used to acquire image sequences , controlled by Andor IQ software . Immunoelectron Microscopy of Plasma Membrane Sheets Cell surface receptor was detected by sequential incubation with 10 m g / ml rabbit anti - FLAG IgG ( Sigma - Aldrich , MO , USA ) and protein A conjugated to 10 nm gold particles , after which the cells were washed in HEPES buffer ( 25 mM HEPES , 25 mM KCl , and 2 . 5 mM Mg acetate [ pH 7 . 0 ] ) . Plasma membrane sheets were prepared using a previously described ‘‘rip - off’’ technique ( Sanan and Anderson , 1991 ; Signoret et al . , 2005 ) . Images were acquired using a Tecnai G2 Spirit transmission EM ( FEI , Eindhoven , the Neth - erlands ) ﬁtted with a Morada 11 MegaPixel TEM camera ( Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions , Mu¨nster , Germany ) . Image Analysis Image analysis was performed using ImageJ software ( Wayne Rasband , NIH ) . For surface lifetime measurements , the time between the appearance and disappearance of clusters was measured as previously described ( Puthen - veedu and von Zastrow , 2006 ) . For cluster intensity measurements , the mean intensity value of clusters immediately prior to endocytic scission and of an identically sized background region of the cell at that same frame was quantiﬁed . Fluorescence values of clusters were divided by those of back - ground regions and expressed as ‘‘Fold over background’’ values . For change in intensity over time measurements , regions of interest were drawn around individualcellsandthechangeinintegratedintensitywasmeasuredandback - ground - corrected . These values were normalized to the intensity of the cell immediately prior to agonist treatment and are represented as ‘‘ % of initial ﬂuorescence’’ values . Analysis of Receptor Degradation by Radioligand Binding The amount of receptor remaining after prolonged agonist treatment was measured by radioligand binding , as previously described ( Hislop et al . , 2009 ; Tsao and von Zastrow , 2000 ) . Speciﬁc binding values are shown , measured as total binding minus the nonspeciﬁc binding at each time point and expressed as the percentage of the binding in untreated cells . Detection of Ubiquitination by Western Blot Analysis Cells stably expressing FLAG - tagged receptors were treated with agonist for the indicated time points and prepared for western blot analysis to detect receptor ubiquitination as previously described ( Hislop et al . , 2011 ) . Densito - metric analysis of band intensities from unsaturated immunoblots were analyzedandquantiﬁedby densitometry usingFluorChem2 . 0 software ( Alpha Innotech ) . Coimmunoprecipitation For immunoprecipitation studies , cells weretransiently transfected , lysedin IP buffer supplemented with standard protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche Applied Science ) , and clariﬁed by centrifugation . Samples were incubated with anti - myc , clone 9E10 antibody ( Millipore ) overnight and later with protein A / G beads ( Pierce ) , washed , and analyzed by western blotting . Immunoblots were probed with anti - HA antibody ( Covance ) .

( F and G ) Cells expressing GFP - tagged Epsin1 and Epsin1ΔUIM and F - MOR were imaged live using TIR - FM . Shown are representative examples showing the localization of GFP - Epsin1 ( F ) and GFP – Epsin1 ΔUIM ( G ) . Scale bar = 5 μm . Supplemental Experimental Procedures Expression constructs and other reagents The FLAG - tagged MOR construct , DsRed - tagged clathrin light chain , and inactive mutant versions of the E3 ligases Cbl , Mdm2 , AIP4 , Nedd 4 . 1 and 4 . 2 , Nedd L1 and 2 , WWP1 and 2 , and Smurf1 and 2 were previously described ( Hislop et al . , 2009 ; Merrifield et al . , 2002 ; Tanowitz and von Zastrow , 2003 ) . FLAG - tagged MOR0cK , MOR0cK R94 , 96K , MOR0cK R170 , 181K , MOR0cK R256 , 265 , 267K , MOR0cK R340K , and MOR K94 , 96R were generated by site - directed mutagenesis ( QuikChange , Stratagene ) . Myc - tagged Smurf2 and GFP - tagged inactive mutant version of Smurf2 were generated using PCR and ligation into pcDNA3 and pEGFP - C1 , respectively . GFP - tagged Smurf2 was made using PCR and ligation into pEGFP - C1 . Epsin1 cDNA was obtained from Open Biosystems and subloned into pEGFP - C1 . Epsin1 cDNA was obtained from Open Biosystems and subcloned into pEGFP - C1 . GFP - Epsin1ΔUIM was generated using oligonucleotide - directed mutagenesis ( QuikChange , Stratagene ) . Transfections were caaried out using Lipofectamine 2000 or RNAi - max ( Invitrogen ) for cDNA or siRNA , respectively , according to manufacturer’s instructions . Stably - transfected cell lines expressing FLAG - tagged receptors were generated by selection for neomycin resistance with G418 ( Geneticin ; Invitrogen ) . Alexa 555 - labelled siRNA duplexes against Smurf2 and siRNA duplexes against Epsin1 were obtained from Qiagen and siRNA duplexes against clathrin ( CHC 17 ) were ordered from Qiagen based on an established siRNA sequence ( Vassilopoulos et al . , 2009 ) . Antibodies used were anti - Smurf2 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , anti - ubiquitin ( P4D1 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , anti - clathrin heavy chain ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , anti - Epsin1 ( SantaCruz Biotechnology , R - 20 antibody ) , rabbit anti - FLAG ( Sigma ) , anti - FLAG - M1 ( Sigma ) , and anti - HA - 11 ( Covance ) . Dyngo - 4a was obtained from Abcam and used at a final concentration of 30μM . TIR - FM Imaging Cells were imaged in Opti - MEM I reduced serum media ( UCSF Cell Culture Facility ) at 37˚C , maintained with a temperature - controlled stage ( Bioscience Tools ) and objective warmer ( Bioptechs ) . Cells were imaged with an exposure time of 100ms and an EM gain of 300 . Surface FLAG - tagged receptors were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 - or 647 - conjugated M1 anti - FLAG antibody for visualization . To visualize endocytic events , cells were treated with 10M DADLE on stage . Bleaching controls were obtained by performing identical experiments in the absence of agonist . For dual imaging experiments , minimal bleed - through between channels was verified by imaging samples labeled only with single fluorophores . Representative live images shown were rendered using Adobe Photoshop software . Immunoelectron microscopy of plasma membrane sheets HEK 293 cells stably - expressing F - MOR or F - MOR0cK were grown on coverslips and incubated with 10µM DADLE for 2 minutes . Cells were then washed with cold PBS and placed on ice to prevent further receptor internalization . Cell surface receptors were detected by sequential incubation with 10µg / ml rabbit anti - FLAG IgG ( Sigma - Aldrich , MO , USA ) and protein A conjugated to 10nm gold particles , after which cells were washed in HEPES buffer ( 25 mM HEPES , 25 mM KCl , and 2 . 5 mM Mg acetate , pH 7 . 0 ) . Plasma membrane sheets were then prepared using a previously described “rip - off” technique ( Sanan and Anderson , 1991 ; Signoret et al . , 2005 ) . Briefly , cover slips were inverted on to formvar / carbon / poly - L - lysine coated electron microscopy grids and light pressure applied for 10 sec using a rubber cork . The cover slips were lifted away to rip open adhered cells and leave portions of the dorsal plasma membrane attached to the grids . The material was briefly washed in HEPES buffer and fixed in 4 % glutaraldehyde . Samples were post - fixed by sequential incubation in 1 % osmium , 1 % tannic acid and 1 % uranyl acetate , and then air - dried . Image Analysis Image analysis was performed using ImageJ software ( Wayne Rasband , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . For surface lifetime measurements , the time between the appearance and disappearance of clusters was measured as previously described ( Puthenveedu and von Zastrow , 2006 ) . Briefly , cluster appearance was identified as the frame where the cluster fluorescence increased above the background fluorescence of an adjacent point of the cell being analyzed . Disappearance of a cluster was determined as the frame where cluster fluorescence decreased to the background fluorescence of a neighboring area of the imaged cell , or when the cluster split off and the subsequent cluster decreased to background levels of fluorescence . Only clusters that clearly appeared and disappeared during image acquisition were included . For cluster intensity measurements , cells were chosen with similar fluorescence values , to ensure equal expression of receptor and clathrin . The mean intensity value of clusters immediately prior to endocytic scission and of an identically - sized background region of the cell at that same frame was quantified . Fluorescence values of clusters were then divided by those of background regions and expressed as “Fold over background” values . For change in intensity over time measurements , ROIs were drawn around individual cells , and the change in integrated intensity was measured and background - corrected . These values were normalized to the intensity of the cell immediately prior to agonist treatment and are represented as “ % of initial fluorescence” values . Detection of ubiquitination by Western blot analysis Cells stably - expressing FLAG - tagged wildtype or mutant MORs were treated with agonist for the indicated time points , lysed in 10mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 1 % SDS , and 10mM iodoacetamide supplemented with a standard protease inhibitor mixture ( Roche Applied Science ) , sonicated , and clarified by centrifugation as previously described ( Hislop et al . , 2011 ) . Samples were incubated overnight with rabbit anti - FLAG antibody ( Sigma ) and later with protein A / G - agarose beads ( Piece ) , then washed and incubated with SDS sample buffer ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with DTT . Western immunoblot analysis was performed using anti - HA - 11 ( Covance ) or anti - ubiquitin ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . Blots were probed with anti - ubiquitin or anti - FLAG antibody to verify equal loading and receptor levels . Automated CCP lifetime analysis Cells were transiently - transfected with DsRed - tagged clathrin light chain and pCDNA 3 . 0 , F - MOR K94 , 96R , or F - MOR0cK R94 , 96K and were treated with agonist while imaging using TIRF - M . Fluorescent particle detection and CCP lifetime tracking was performed on raw image sequences using a previously established Matlab package that is publicly available ( Jaqaman et al . , 2008 ; Loerke et al . , 2009 ) . Statistical analysis Quantitative measurements were averaged across multiple independent experiments , with the number of experiments indicated in the corresponding figure legends . Error bars represent the standard error of the mean quantified after compiling mean determinations across multiple experiments . The statistical significance of the measured differences between conditions were analyzed using the appropriate variations of one - or two - way ANOVA and post - test , specified in figure legends , calculated using Prism 4 . 0 software ( GraphPad Software , Inc ) . The relative significance of each of the reported differences is indicated by the calculated p values listed in the figure legends and shown graphically in the figures .
