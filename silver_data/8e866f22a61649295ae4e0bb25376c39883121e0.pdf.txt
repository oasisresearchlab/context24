NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 7 : 11046 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms11046 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 1 C omplementary to direct ﬂuorescent protein fusion , more and more examples of live cell protein labelling and imaging have recently emerged using epitope tags : peptides that do not function by themselves but can be recognized by other intracellularly expressed proteins . An epitope tag fused to the target protein can become an enzyme substrate to be ligated to a small molecule 1 . Alternatively , it can bind an intracellularly expressed antibody / nanobody to bring in functional protein units , such as a ﬂuorescent protein for imaging 2 , 3 or ubiquitin ligase for protein degradation 4 . This two - component labelling approach has a number of advantages . It is highly modular because the functional units can be easily replaced 2 . A small peptide epitope tag may induce less perturbation than a much larger ﬂuorescent protein . In addition , small epitope tags can be arranged into a multimerization scaffold . For example , the SunTag 2 allows a dramatic enhancement of ﬂuorescence signal by bringing as many as 24 green ﬂuorescent proteins ( GFPs ) to a single target protein . This arrangement enables it to successfully overcome an intrinsic problem such as the low afﬁnity between the tagged protein and the binding module . Alternatively , the SunTag could have used a higher afﬁnity and a more precise expression stoichiometry between them , so that there is neither incomplete labelling nor background from excessive binding modules . One approach to relax this afﬁnity and stoichiometry requirement is to have a binding module that becomes ﬂuorescent only when it is on the epitope . In this case , as long as the binding module is expressed in excess of the target protein , the equilibrium can be shifted towards complete labelling . For this purpose , we adopted a split super - folder GFP ( sfGFP ) that was previously engineered for efﬁcient self - complementation without the assistance of other protein – protein interactions 5 . This split construct breaks the sequence of sfGFP between the tenth and the eleventh b - strand into two parts : GFP1 - 10 and GFP11 , with GFP11 being a short , 16 amino acid peptide ( Fig . 1a ) . The GFP1 - 10 fragment , which contains the three residues that constitute the GFP chromophore , is nonﬂuorescent by itself because chromophore maturation requires the conserved E222 residue located on GFP11 ( ref . 6 ) . Upon complementation , the reconstituted GFP becomes ﬂuorescent after the chromophore maturation reaction is completed 5 , 7 . This split GFP system has been previously used for protein quantiﬁcation 5 , visualization of protein subcellular localization 8 – 10 , single - molecule imaging 11 , cell - cell contact detection 12 , as well as in vitro protein complex assembly 13 . Some of these applications 8 – 10 fused the small GFP11 fragment to the target protein as an epitope tag . To expand this approach , here we establish 1 - 10 / 11 split ﬂuorescent protein constructs ( FP11 tags and the corresponding FP1 - 10 fragments ) as a general method for cellular protein visualization including multicolour imaging , especially for the labelling of endogenous protein via genetic knock - in and signal ampliﬁcation with tandem tags . Results Live cell protein labelling using GFP11 and sfCherry11 . To validate protein labelling using FP11 - tag in mammalian cells , we fused GFP11 to the ( amino ) N terminus of human b - actin ( with an 18 a . a . GSS linker ) and co - expressed it with GFP1 - 10 in HeLa cells . We observed strong actin - like ﬂuorescence signal , whereas GFP11 : : b - actin or GFP1 - 10 alone gave no detectable signal ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . We compared the average ﬂuorescence intensity ( representing a combination of expression efﬁciency , complementation efﬁciency and ﬂuorophore maturation 14 ) of b - actin labelled with either full - length sfGFP or GFP11 and expressed using the same vector ( Fig . 1c ) . The difference between the two labelling approaches was small , indicating that GFP11 - tag can label the target protein with a similar efﬁciency as direct GFP fusion . We then demonstrated that GFP11 - tag is compatible with a variety of cellular proteins for live imaging , including cytoskeleton ( b - actin and b - tubulin ) , clathrin - coated pits ( clathrin light chain ) , histone ( H2B ) and focal adhesion ( zyxin ) ( Fig . 1d ) . By adding an endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) signal peptide to GFP1 - 10 ( GFP1 - 10 ER ) , we were able to speciﬁcally label ER luminal protein ( calreticulin ) or the extracellular domain of plasma membrane protein ( b 2 adrenergic receptor ; Fig . 1d ) . In addition , we showed that the Y66W mutation for cyan ﬂuorescent protein ( CFP ) and the T203Y mutation for yellow ﬂuorescent protein ( YFP ) 15 , 16 can be successfully introduced into GFP1 - 10 to label proteins with the corresponding colour ( Fig . 1e ) . To enable multicolour imaging , we tested splitting mCherry at the same site of the GFP1 - 10 / 11 system . However , no ﬂuorescent complementation signal was observed when co - expressing mCher - ry : : b - actin and mCherry1 - 10 ( data not shown ) , which is consistent with previous characterization of split - mCherry constructs 17 . Instead , we were able to obtain a functional split from super - folder Cherry ( sfCherry , derived from mCherry for potentially better folding 18 ) , resulting in an 18 amino - acid peptide for sfCherry11 ( Fig . 1a ) . We veriﬁed that sfCherry11 : : b - actin can be ﬂuorescently imaged when co - expressing sfCherry1 - 10 ( Fig . 1b ) . Nevertheless , its overall ﬂuorescence signal level is substantially weaker than that of direct sfCherry fusion ( Fig . 1c ) , potentially caused by the less - efﬁcient self - complementation between sfCherry11 and sfCherry1 - 10 . This problem could be solved by further optimization of the split - construct 1 or by tandem tagging which we will describe later . Labelling endogenous proteins with FP11 tag . A ﬁrst unique application of FP11 epitope tag is to generate libraries of ﬂuorescently labelled endogenous proteins via genetic knock - in by homology - directed DNA repair . Previously , such a library created for Saccharomyces cerevisiae has demonstrated its wide application in the systematic investigation of protein localization , gene expression and cellular behaviour 19 , 20 . Because the DNA sequence for GFP11 is only 57 nt ( including a 3 a . a . linker ) , we could use very short homology arms ( 70 nt on either side , plus the start or stop codon for N - or carboxy ( C ) - terminal labelling , respectively ) , so that the entire donor DNA can be a 200 nt single - strand oligo - DNA ( ssDNA ) . Unlike the long donor DNA for full - length GFP , which must be made through multiple cloning steps , GFP11 donor ssDNA can be directly synthesized , thus making it cost - effective for library generation . As a demonstration , we used synthetic ssDNA donors to knock GFP11 - tag into four genes , LMNA , HIST2H2BE , CBX1 and PRKACA , which encode lamin A / C , histone H2B ( H2B ) , heterochromatin protein 1 homologue ( HP1 ) and cAMP - dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit a ( PKA ) , respectively . Using the Cas9 / sgRNA plasmid transfection method 21 , we have obtained a knock - in efﬁciency in the range of 0 . 5 B 0 . 8 % ( negative controls : 0 . 01 B 0 . 09 % ) ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Other established knock - in approaches , such as by direct nucleofection of the Cas9 / sgRNA complex 22 , may yield higher knock - in efﬁciencies . We imaged these cells and validated the speciﬁcity by immunoﬂuorescence ( Fig . 2b ) . This approach can be readily extended to other mammalian proteins or even animal systems given the recent advancements in CRISPR - mediate genome engineering technologies . Signal ampliﬁcation using tandem FP11 tags . With their small sizes , we can arrange FP11 - tags into tandem arrays to amplify the ﬂuorescence signal ( Fig . 3a ) , thus addressing the issues of poor ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms11046 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 7 : 11046 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms11046 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications GFP11 : : clathrin + GFP1 - 10 GFP11 : : H2B + GFP1 - 10 GFP11 : : β - tubulin + GFP1 - 10 zyxin : : GFP11 + GFP1 - 10 Calreticulin : : GFP11 + GFP1 - 10 ER GFP11 : : β 2 AR + GFP1 - 10 ER d b a e CFP channel YFP channel Merge GFP11 : : β - actin + CFP1 - 10 or YFP1 - 10 . . .

To design tandem GFP11 x3 , GFP11 x7 and sfCherry11 x4 tags , we purposely used synonymous codons to avoid deleterious recombination during cloning , which can be caused by repetitive nucleic acid sequences . For GFP11 x7 , we tested either 5 a . a . or 15 a . a . linker length between the repeats . Using a fused mCherry as the reference to normalize expression level differences , we observed that the ﬂuorescence signal for GFP11 x3 : : mCherry : : b - tubulin and GFP11 x7 : : mCherry : : b - tubulin increased proportionally compared with GFP11 : : mCherry : : b - tubulin without the tandem repeat ( Fig . 3b , c ) . No signiﬁcant signal difference was recorded for GFP11 x7 using either the 5 a . a . or 15 a . a . linker ( Fig . 3c ) , indicating a negligible interference between reconstituted GFPs in the tandem tag . We also observed a proportional enhancement of overall cellular ﬂuorescence comparing sfCherry11 x4 : : b - actin with sfCherry11 : : b - actin ( Fig . 3d , e ) . Combining sfCherry11 x4 - tagged b - actin with GFP11 - tagged clathrin light chain , we showed two colour imaging using FP11 tags ( Fig . 3f ) . Compared with SunTag 2 , tandem FP11 tags have the advantage that FP1 - 10 can be overexpressed without causing a ﬂuorescence background , thus allowing a much simpler expression control . The ﬂuorescence ampliﬁcation by tandem FP11 - tag can greatly beneﬁt imaging experiments that are difﬁcult because of low signal , such as single particle tracking of intraﬂagellar transport ( IFT ) in primary cilia 24 . We fused GFP11 x7 to the C terminus of IFT20 , which moves along ciliary microtubules . Compared with the image of IFT20 : : GFP , IFT20 : : GFP11 x7 generated a much higher signal from IFT particles in the primary cilium of mouse IMCD3 cells ( Fig . 4a , Supplementary Fig . 3 and Supplementary Movie 1 ) . Moreover , analysis of the kymograph showed no signiﬁcant difference between the two labelling methods for either anterograde or retrograde transport speed ( Fig . 4a , b ) , suggesting that IFT20 labelling using tandem GFP11 - tag did not perturb its function . Another advantage of a brighter label is to reduce photobleaching and phototoxicity by lowering excitation intensity while maintaining the same signal level . To demonstrate this application , we imaged Drosophila S2 cells expressing 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 2 F A M / H EX r a t i o ( % ) a Lamin H2B neg ( 2 ) + s g R N A ( 5 ) neg ( 5 ) + s g R N A ( 4 ) neg ( 3 ) + s g R N A ( 5 ) b G F P I mm uno f l uo r e sc en c e H2B HP1 Lamin A / C PKA M e r ge neg ( 9 ) + s g R N A ( 16 ) HP1 PKA Figure 2 | Labelling endogenous proteins using GFP11 - tag .

With one - seventh the excitation laser power , the GFP11 x7 sample generated a similar level of ﬂuorescence signal compared with either GFP or GFP11 , but its photobleaching rate was approximately nine times as slow ( Fig . 4d ) . Surprisingly , even the non - repeating GFP11 displayed approximately three times as slow a photobleaching rate as that of direct GFP fusion . A possible explanation for this effect is that the complementation between GFP11 and GFP1 - 10 can be reversed , allowing photobleached GFP1 - 10 to be exchanged for an intact one in the cytoplasm , although such exchange may be limited by the maturation process of the GFP chromophore . Tandem FP11 tags as multimerization scaffolds . Tandem FP11 - tag can also be used in non - imaging applications 13 as a scaffold to assemble multiple copies of proteins for synergistic functioning . Previously , we have developed a CRISPR / Cas9 - based transcriptional activation system ( CRISPRa ) 25 , which activates a speciﬁc gene by targeting it with a nuclease - deactivated Cas9 ( dCas9 ) fused to the transcription activator VP64 . We have then observed that the activation of natively suppressed gene by CRISPRa often require multiple copies of transcription activation VP64 domains at the target 2 , 26 – 28 . Here , we showed that tandem GFP11 - tag could be used to achieve this goal . We chose to target the C - X - C chemokine receptor type 4 gene CXCR4 , which is poorly expressed in K265 cells . We fused VP64 to GFP1 - 10 , and then coexpressed it with dCas9 : : GFP11 x7 and a CXCR4 targeting sgRNA 26 in K265 cells ( Fig . 5a ) . We immunostained these cells for CXCR4 and quantiﬁed its expression level by ﬂow cytometry ( Fig . 5b ) . A 45 ± 2 - fold signal increase was detected compared with the controls , whereas no signiﬁcant activation can be observed either with a non - targeting sgRNA or with direct G F P a m C he rr y ( r e f e r en c e ) GFP11 x1 GFP11 x3 GFP11 x7 b c sfCherry11 x1 sfCherry11 x4 x1 x3 x7 x1 x7 15 a . a . linker 5 a . a . linker Number of GFP11 repeats 2 4 6 8 R e l a t i v e , no r m a li z ed f l uo r e sc en c e Protein FP1 - 10 FP11 × n + = Protein d e 1 2 3 4 R e l a t i v e f l uo r e sc en c e Number of sfCherry11 repeats X 1 ( 18 ) X 4 ( 16 ) Merge f GFP11 : : clathrin + GFP1 – 10 sfCherry11 x4 : : β - actin + sfCherry1 – 10 Figure 3 | Ampliﬁcation of ﬂuorescence signal by tandem FP11 .

Immunoﬂuorescence images conﬁrmed CXCR4 expression in these cells ( Fig . 5c ) . In conjugation with SunTag , tandem GFP11 can serve as an orthogonal multimerization tag multiplexed applications . We also observed more robust expression of GFP1 - 10 : : VP64 , potentially due to its better solubility than scFv : : VP64 in SunTag 2 , 26 . Discussion The experiments above showcased the versatility of FP11 as an epitope tag for protein labelling , library generation and signal ampliﬁcation , in both imaging and non - imaging applications . The functionality of the FP11 tags can be further expanded . For example , we have shown that the point mutations converting GFP to CFP and YFP can be successfully introduced to GFP1 - 10 . Similarly , other functional mutants of GFP , such as blue ﬂuorescent protein ( BFP ) 15 , photoactivatable GFP ( PA - GFP ) 29 and the pH - sensitive pHluorin 30 , may possibly be adaptable for FP11 labelling , too . Of course , as in any protein labelling method , validating the proper functionality of the labelled protein is always essential , especially when tandem GFP11 - tag is used . In our case , GFP11 x7 was well tolerated by multiple proteins including IFT20 and Cas9 . Therefore , we expect a broad applicability for tandem GFP11 - tag in helping live cell imaging to overcome the issues of poor signal , photobleaching and phototoxicity . We note that when combined with genetic knock - in , the tandem FP11 tag could help the visualization of proteins with low endogenous expression levels . However , knocking in tandem FP11 tags require longer donor ssDNAs that contain the larger insert and potentially longer homology arms . While such long ssDNAs cannot be directly synthesized , they can be produced by reverse transcription methods 31 to avoid the involvement of cloning . Methods Molecular cloning . The amino - acid sequence of super - folder mCherry ( sfCherry ) was obtained from the published literature 18 . sfCherry was split between 208D and 209Y at the middle of the loop between b - strands 10 and 11 ( Fig . 1a ) . For the nucleotide sequence of sfCherry1 - 10 and sfCherry11 , seeSupplementary Tables 1 and 2 . The DNAs of GFP11 ( ref . 5 ) and sfCherry11 were directly synthesized . The DNAs of H2B , zyxin , clathrin light chain , b - actin were subcloned from the corresponding sfGFP or mEmerald fusion plasmids ( cDNA source : the Michael Davidson Fluorescent Protein Collection at the UCSF Nikon Imaging Center ) . We performed the following restriction enzyme digestion ( amino - acid linker length shown in parentheses for each ) : histone H2B ( 10 a . a . ) : sfGFP sequence between AgeI and BglII ( sfGFP - H2B C - 10 ) ; zyxin ( 6 a . a . ) : sfGFP sequence between BamHI and NotI ( sfGFP - zyxin - 6 ) ; clathrin light chain ( 15 a . a . ) : mEmerald sequence between NheI and BglII ( mEmerald - clathrin - 15 ) ; b - actin ( 18 a . a . ) : mEmerald sequence between AgeI and BglII ( mEmerald - actin - C - 18 ) . PCR - ampliﬁed GFP11 as well as sfCherry11 fragments were then inserted into the digested vectors using In - Fusion assembly ( Life Technologies ) . For the cloning of GFP11 - tagged Drosophila calreticulin , GFP11 was inserted at the nineteenth a . a . position where the signal peptide ends . GFP11 : : calreticulin was inserted into Drosophila expression pACUH vectors ( source : Yuh - Nung Jan ) at the EcoRI / XbaI sites .

For the expression of GFP1 - 10 , GFP1 - 10 was synthesized and cloned into pACUH vectors , pcDNA3 . 1 vectors as well as modiﬁed lentiviral pHR - SFFV vector 32 . For GFP1 - 10 sequence information , see Supplementary Table 1 . For the expression of sfCherry1 - 10 , sfCherry1 - 10 was synthesized and cloned into pcDNA3 . 1 vectors . To generate an ER - localized GFP1 - 10 ( GFP1 - 10 ER ) , a signal peptide ( 5 0 - ATG ATGTGGTG CAAAACAGTGATAGTGTTGCTGGCGACAGTCGGCTTTATTA GTGCC - 3 0 ) and an ER retention sequence ( 5 0 - AGCGAACACGACGAATTG - 3 0 ) were fused to the N - terminal and the C - terminal of GFP1 - 10 , respectively . The SP : : GFP1 - 10 : : SEHDEL fragment was cloned into pACUH vectors . For mammalian expression , we cloned SP : : GFP1 - 10 into pcDNA3 . 1 vectors . For CFP and YFP imaging , we introduced point mutations in GFP1 - 10 . It has been previously reported that the introduced point mutations Y66W and T203Y in GFP alter the GFP spectral properties to CFP and YFP , respectively . We generated the corresponding mutations in GFP1 - 10 with the Q5 site - Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( NEB ) . The primers were designed using the NEB online primer design software ( NEBaseChanger ) . The used primers were as follows : YFP _ forward ( 5 0 - CTACCTCTCAtatCAAACAGTCCTGAGCAAAGATC - 3 0 ) , YFP _ reverse ( 5 0 - TGATTATCAGGAAGAAGTACC - 3 0 ) , CFP _ forward ( 5 0 - ACGCTTACGTgg GGAGTTCAGTGC - 3 0 ) , and CFP _ reverse ( 5 0 - TGTTACGAGAGTCGGCCA - 3 0 ) . We fused these colour variants to the N terminus of Drosophila b - actin and cloned them into pACUH vectors . To prepare GFP11 repeat arrays constructs , we ﬁrst synthesized GFP11 x1 , x3 or x7 with long ( 15 a . a . ) or short ( 5 a . a . ) linkers ( see the sequence information in Supplementary Table 2 ) . Then , these GFP11 fragments were fused to b - tubulin , mouse IFT20 and dCas9 . Speciﬁcally , for the cloning of GFP11 x1 , x3 or x7 : : mCherry : : b - tubulin , Drosophila b - tubulin ( cDNA source : R . Vale ) was cloned into pACUH vectors . We then inserted mCherry - fused GFP11 x1 , x3 or x7 at the EcoRI site . For the cloning of GFP11 x1 or x7 : : Ift20 , we ﬁrst fused Ift20 with GFP11 x1 or x7 , and then we inserted it into the EcoRI / NotI sites of pEGFP - N1 vectors . For the cloning dCas9 : : GFP11 x7 , we modiﬁed our SunTag vector ( pHRdSV40 - NLS - dCas9 - 24xGCN4 _ v4 - NLS - P2A - BFP - dWPRE ( addgene # 60910 ) ) ( ref . 2 ) . 24xGCN4 was cut out by BamHI and NotI , and GFP11 x7 was inserted into these sites . For the cloning of sfCherry : : b - actin , we synthesized full - length sfCherry and cloned it into the vector containing b - actin fragment ( see above ) at the BglII / NheI site . To construct sfCherry11 x4 : : b - actin , we also synthesized sfCherry11 x4 , and replaced the sfCherry fragment to the tandem one at the BglII / NheI site . For the sequence information of sfCherry11 x4 , see Supplementary Table 2 . For our CRISPRa assay in Fig . 5 , we fused an NLS sequence to the C - terminal of GFP1 - 10 : : VP64 and cloned into modiﬁed pHR vectors . For the GFP1 - 10 : : VP64 : : NLS sequence information , see Supplementary Table 3 . Cell culture . The cell lines used for imaging were human HeLa ( UCSF cell culture facility ) , HEK293FT ( gifted from Bruce Conklin ) and K562 cells ( UCSF cell culture facility ) , mouse IMCD 3 cells ( UCSF cell culture facility ) and Drosophila S2 cells ( UCSF cell culture facility ) . HeLa and HEK293FT cells were grown in a Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium with 10 % FCS ( UCSF Cell Culture Facility ) , 100 unitsml (cid:2) 1 streptomycin , 100 m gml (cid:2) 1 penicillin and 2mM glutamine . K562 cells were grown in RPMI - 1640 with 25mM HEPES and 2 . 0gl (cid:2) 1 NaHCo3 in 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 100 unitsml (cid:2) 1 streptomycin , 100 m gml (cid:2) 1 penicillin and 2mM glutamine . Mouse IMCD3 cells were maintained in a mixture of DMEM and Ham’s F12 medium ( 1 : 1 vol / vol ) with 10 % FBS . Drosophila S2 cells were grown in Schneider’s Drosophila Medium with 10 % FBS ( Life Technologies ) . Generation of stable cell lines and lentiviral infection . For viral production , HEK293T were plated in T25 ﬂasks . Twenty - four hours later , the 3 m g of lentiviral vector pHR - SFFV - GFP1 - 10 , 3 m g of lentiviral packaging plasmid pCMV - dR8 . 91 and 0 . 3 m g of envelop plasmid pMD2 . G were transfected into the cells using FuGENE HD ( Promega ) following the manufacturer’s protocol . Twenty - four hours after transfection , the culture medium was replaced . Fifty - six hours after transfection , the lentiviral supernatant was harvested and kept at (cid:2) 80 (cid:2) C for later use . HEK293FT cells stably expressing GFP1 - 10 were generated by infecting with lentivirus diluted 1 : 10 in DMEM medium and incubating for 24h in the medium . We further plated the HEK293FT cells expressing GFP1 - 10 at one cell per well in a 96 - well plate and isolated monoclonal cell lines that showed modest expression . To construct stable cell lines and measure CRISPRa activity , K562 cells were lentivirally transduced with constructs that express either dCas9 : : GFP11 x7 and GFP1 - 10 : : VP64 or dCas9 : : VP64 : : BFP . The cells were additionally transduced with negative control and CXCR4 targeting sgRNA expression constructs 2 . For IFT imaging , the plasmids encoding IFT20 : : GFP ( ref . 33 ) and IFT20 : : GFP11 x7 were transfected into IMCD3 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Life Technologies ) and then selected with Geneticin ( 400 m gml (cid:2) 1 : Life Technologies ) . After isolating a stable monoclonal cell line , the cells were infected by the GFP1 - 10 virus - particle - containing medium . Transient expression .

Drosophila expression plasmids ( 100 m g of each construct per well ) were transfected using Effectene ( QIAGEN ) into cultures of S2 cells grown on a 12 - well plate ( Eppendorf ) . Note that in Fig . 3 and Supplementary Movie 2 , GFP1 - 10 and GFP11 x7 : : mCherry : : b - tubulin plasmids were transfected into S2 cells at a concentration ratio of 7 : 1 . Forty - eight hours after transfection , the cells were live - imaged or ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for later imaging . To facilitate cilia generation , IMCD3 cells were cultured in serum - free media 1 day before imaging . For two - colour imaging in Fig . 3f , HeLa cells were infected with GFP1 - 10 lentivirus and , 24h later , 50ng of Clathrin light chain : : GFP11 , 100ng of sfCherry1 - 10 and 100ng of sfCherry11 x4 : : b - actin were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Life Technologies ) . Imaging . The cells were grown in 96 - well glass bottom plates with # 1 . 5 high - performance cover glass ( In Vitro Scientiﬁc ) coated with either Poly - L - Lysine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) or Fibronectine ( Roche ) and were imaged on an inverted Nikon Ti - E microscope , Yokogawa CSU - 22 confocal scanner unit , (cid:3) 60 / 1 . 4 NA oil objective , an Andor EM - CCD camera ( iXon DU897 ) and Micro - Manager software . Images in Fig . 1e were taken using an inverted Nikon Ti - E microscope with wide - ﬁeld illumination , (cid:3) 100 / 1 . 4 NA oil objective , and a sCMOS camera ( Hamamatsu Flash 4 . 0 ) . For IFT20 time - lapse imaging in Fig . 4 , the cells were grown in DMEM and Ham’s F12 ( 1 : 1 vol : vol ) medium without phenol red , and were imaged in a 37 (cid:2) C chamber on a Nikon Ti - E microscope with Laser TIRF system , an Andor DU897 EMCCD camera and an Apo TIRF (cid:3) 100 / 1 . 49 NA oil objective . All the imaging experiments were performed at UCSF Nikon Image Center . Image analysis . To measure the brightness of full - length FPs and split - FPs in Figs 1c and 3e , we took the images of b - actin - fused full - length FPs or split - FPs . These mCherry , sfCherry or GFP images were taken with (cid:3) 10 0 . 3 NA or (cid:3) 60 1 . 4 NA objectives , respectively . The acquired images were ﬁrst background - subtracted ; each of an average value of a 10 - m m diameter region of interest ( ROI ) outside a cell was applied for the background subtraction . Then , the mean within a 10 - m m diameter ROI inside a cell was calculated for each cell . A total 6 B 18 cells were measured for each condition . To characterize the tandem GFP11 - tag , we ﬁrst set the excitation intensity and exposure time using a GFP11 x1 - linker - mCherry fusion protein ( GFP11 x1 : : mCherry ) so that the camera counts for GFP and mCherry were in the same range . We then imaged the GFP11 x1 , x3 and x7 - labelled b - tubulin samples using these parameters . To quantify the ratio of signal enhancement , we acquired images on a wide - ﬁeld microscope using a (cid:3) 10 / 0 . 3 NA objective to achieve a larger ﬁeld of view . The acquired images were ﬁrst background - subtracted and then binarized as ‘0’ for outside and ‘1’ for inside the cells . The GFP - to - mCherry signal ratio was calculated for each pixel within the mask , and the mean ratio within a 10 - m m diameter ROI was computed for each cell . A total 50 cells were measured for each condition . To trace the ﬂuorescent intensities for live imaging of microtubules in Fig . 4 , we used Plot z - axis Proﬁle function in ImageJ . For each photobleaching experiment , we calculated the average ﬂuorescence intensity in a 3 m m (cid:3) 3 m m square ROI in one cell over the duration of the experiment , subtracted the background measured from a cell - free region in the same ﬁeld of view , and normalized the trajectory to the average value of the ﬁrst 10 time points . Figure 4d reported the mean normalized photobleaching trajectories from ﬁve experiments for each construct ( GFP , GFP11 and GFP11 x7 ) . For the photobleaching , rates were calculated from the slope of a linear ﬁt to the initial linear segment of the decay curves . IFT20 moving velocities were measured by kymographs analysis using ImageJ . In brief , we drew a segmented line along a cilium in an image sequence and then created a kymograph using the KymoResliceWide plugin . The velocity of IFP particles were determined by drawing straight lines along IFT trajectories in the kymograph and then measuring the angle of the lines . A detailed particle tracking protocol was described in a previous publication 34 . Immunocytochemistry . Mouse monoclonal antibodies used were anti - GFP ( [ 1 : 100 ] Sigma - Aldrich , G6539 ) , acetylated tubulin ( [ 1 : 1 , 000 ] Sigma - Aldrich , T7451 ) and anti - histone H2B ( [ 1 : 50 ] Abcam , ab52484 ) antibodies . Rabbit poly - clonal antibodies used were anti - g - tubulin ( [ 1 : 1 , 000 ] Sigma - Aldrich , T5192 ) , anti - lamin A / C ( [ 1 : 20 ] Santa Cruz Biotechnology , H110 ) , anti - cAMP protein kinase catalytic subunit ( [ 1 : 1 , 000 ] Abcam , ab26322 ) and anti - CBX / HP1 beta antibodies ( [ 1 : 100 ] Abcam , ab10478 ) . TRITC or Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated secondary antibodies ( Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories , Inc . or Life Technologies , respectively ) were used for indirect immunoﬂuorescence detection . BG - conjugated dyes , including SNAP - Surface Alexa Fluor 647 and 546 ( NEB ) , were used for staining SNAP - tag expressed in cells . The cells were ﬁxed with 4 % formaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) for 15min , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , stained for primary antibodies and Alexa - Fluor - conjugated secondary antibodies , or BG - conjugated ﬂuorophores for SNAP - tag at 4 (cid:2) C overnight . Design of sgRNAs for CRISPR - mediated knock - in . We searched the human genome for CRISPR target sites ( GN 20 GG ) . We used the px330 vector provided through AddGene to generate the sgRNA and Cas9 expression construct . For the individual target sequences , see Supplementary Table 4 . Design of TaqMan PCR primers and probes . For the design of TaqMan PCR primers and probes , we used the PrimerQuest software ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) and the Primer - BLAST ( NCBI ) . For the probes , the PrimerQuest default setting gave us optical probe sequences , whereas the primers were identiﬁed by the Primer - BLAST . We designed that one of the primers would anneal inside of the donor sequence but not another . The probes and primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies . For sequence of the primers and probes , see Supplementary Table 6 . Design of homologous recombination templates . To prepare EGFP - LMNA homologous recombination templates ( 70 or 200bp homology arms ) , we synthesized two DNA fragments ( LMNA 5 0 regulatory region þ one half of a GFP coding sequence ( 1 – 350bp ) , and another half of a GFP coding sequence ( 350 – 717bp ) þ LMNA coding region ) . Subsequently , they were cloned into the pcDNA3 . 1 vector in which a CMV promoter sequence was removed . ssDNA donors ( 200nt in total length ) were manually designed by adding 70nt homology sequences to both side of the GFP11 sequence . ssDNA donors were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies . For the sequence of oligo - nucleotide donors , see Supplementary Table 5 . CRISPR - mediated knock - in using plasmid transfection . For the knock - in experiments , 200ng of Cas9 þ sgRNA vector and 400ng of an oligonucleotide donor DNA were transfected to HEK293FT cells stably expressing GFP1 - 10 per 24 - well plate ( Eppendorf ) . Genomic DNA was extracted from cells 3 days after transfection with the DNAzol reagent ( Molecular Research Center , Inc ) . We further enriched GFP - positive cells by ﬂuorescence - activated cell sorting . Measurement of knock - in efﬁciency using TaqMan / ddPCR . The premixtures of TaqMan probes and primers consisted of 5 m M of TaqMan probe , 18 m M of a forward primer and 18 m M of a reverse primer . To optimize PCR annealing temperatures and characterize detection efﬁciencies , we mixed Bio - Rad ddPCR Supermix for Probes ( 12 . 5 m l ) , FAM - and HEX probe and primer premixture ( 1 . 25 m l each ) , and mixture of a genomic DNA ( 100ng ) and a knock - in allele plasmid ( 0 . 5pg or series of diluted plasmid ) in 25 m l total volume . Droplet generation , PCR reaction and droplets read were performed by a QX100 Droplet Generator , a C1000 Thermal Cycler and a QX100 Droplet Reader ( Bio - Rad ) , respectively according to the instructions from the manufacturer . Droplets were analysed by QuantSoft software ( Bio - Rad ) . The optimal annealing temperatures for LMNA , HIST2H2BE , CBX1 and PRKACA were 62 , 60 , 60 , 59 and 58 (cid:2) C , respectively . To measure the knock - in efﬁciency , we mixed Bio - Rad ddPCR Supermix for Probes ( 12 . 5 m l ) , FAM - and HEX probe and primer premixture ( 1 . 25 m l each ) , and HEK293FT genomic DNA ( 100ng ) in 25 m l total volume . After droplet generation and PCR reaction , the knock - in frequencies were calculated by taking concentration ratio of a mutant - allele - speciﬁc FAM probe and a wild - type - allele - speciﬁc HEX probe ( TUBA1A genomic locus ) . Transcription activation assay . For CXCR4 gene activation , the cells were dissociated in Gibco Cell Dissociation Buffer and then stained in PBS with 10 % FBS for 1h at room temperature using anti - human CXCR4 antibody ( 2 m gml (cid:2) 1 ; Biolegend , 12G5 ) conjugated to allophycocyanine . CXCR4 activation was measured using LSR II ﬂow cytometer ( BD Biosciences ) at 72 or 96h post infection as written above 25 . References 1 . Fernandez - Suarez , M . & Ting , A . Y .
