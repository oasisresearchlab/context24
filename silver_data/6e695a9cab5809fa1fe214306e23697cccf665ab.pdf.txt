DENGIS , L . R . NE´LISSEN , AND PAUL G . ROUXHET * Unite´ de Chimie des Interfaces , Universite´ Catholique de Louvain , Louvain - la - Neuve , Belgium Received 27 June 1994 / Accepted 11 October 1994 The ﬂocculation of two brewing yeast strains , top - fermenting strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae MUCL 38485 and bottom - fermenting strain Saccharomyces carlsbergensis MUCL 28285 , has been investigated by means of a turbidimetric test . The two strains showed different electrical properties , a different hydrophobicity , and a different surface chemical composition . They ﬂocculated according to completely different mechanisms ; how - ever , no correlation between the cell physicochemical properties and the onset of ﬂocculation was found for either strain . Flocculation of the bottom strain was governed by a lectin - mediated mechanism . It was inhibited by mannose and some other sugars , required calcium speciﬁcally , occurred in a narrow pH range different from the isoelectric point , and was not inﬂuenced by ethanol . The onset of ﬂocculation at the end of the exponential phase was controlled both by the appearance of ‘‘active’’ lectins at the cell surface and by the decrease in sugar concentration in the solution . Flocculation of the top strain was not inhibited by mannose , did not require the addition of calcium , and took place at the cell isoelectric point . Low concentrations of ethanol broadened the pH range in which the cells ﬂocculated , and ﬂocculation was favored by an increase of ionic strength . Adsorbed ethanol may induce ﬂocculation by reducing the electrostatic repulsion between cells , by decreasing steric stabilization , and / or by allowing the protrusion of polymer chains into the liquid phase . The onset of ﬂoccu - lation was controlled by both a change of the cell surface and an increase in ethanol concentration . The only evidence for an adhesin - mediated mechanism was the speciﬁc requirement for a small amount of calcium . Flocculation of yeast cells is usually observed at the end of beer fermentation and is of great importance in brewery ( 54 ) . Its mechanism is not yet completely understood and is still the subject of much controversy ( for reviews , see references 10 , 11 , 46 , 55 , and 56 ) . It is a very complex process which depends on numerous factors : the yeast strain ( genetics , physiological state , and metabolism ) , the composition of the culture me - dium , and the culture conditions ( temperature , agitation , and aeration ) . The involvement of all of these parameters in the ﬂocculation process makes it very difﬁcult to compare different studies and may thus explain the many conﬂicting data found in the literature . Cell ﬂocculation can be controlled by speciﬁc ( molecular recognition ) and nonspeciﬁc ( double - layer interactions , van der Waals forces , hydrophobic interactions , salt bridges , and steric repulsion ) interactions . The most generally accepted mechanism is one mediated by lectins , which recognize man - nan receptors on adjacent cells and require the presence of calcium ( 28 , 33 – 35 , 37 , 57 ) . van Hamersveld et al . ( 65 ) found that the net interaction energy of ﬂocculated brewer’s yeast was much higher than could be expected on the basis of non - speciﬁc ( van der Waals and electrostatic ) interactions only . However , the involvement of a molecular recognition mecha - nism does not mean that nonspeciﬁc interactions are negligi - ble : the speciﬁc binding can be revealed only if there is a nonspeciﬁc repulsion ( 5 ) . Speciﬁc interactions take place at a very short distance ( less than 1 . 5 nm ) only , whereas nonspeciﬁc interactions can occur over a long distance ( 9 ) . The importance of physicochemical properties which are responsible for nonspeciﬁc interactions has been investigated for brewer’s yeast . Van Haecht et al . ( 64 ) found a correlation between the isoelectric point of yeast cells and the N / P con - centration ratio measured at the surface by X - ray photoelec - tron spectroscopy ( XPS ) . Amory et al . ( 1 ) reported that the inﬂuence of the culture conditions on the tendency of the cells to ﬂocculate was related to the variation of the surface elec - trical properties . In an extended study , Amory and Rouxhet ( 2 ) found that top - fermenting strains were systematically more hydrophobic and less negatively charged at pH 4 than bottom - fermenting strains . The onset of ﬂocculation was found to coincide with an increase in surface hydrophobicity ( 27 , 53 , 62 ) . Straver et al . ( 59 ) hypothesized that ﬁmbriae were respon - sible for both speciﬁc interactions and hydrophobicity . The aim of this work was to achieve a better understanding of the relative importance of different types of interactions in yeast cell ﬂocculation . The ﬂocculation behavior of a top - fer - menting strain , which is not inhibited by sugars , and a bottom - fermenting strain , which is inhibited by sugars , is studied in detail by means of a turbidimetric test . The inﬂuences of pH , the concentration of sugars , cations , ethanol and other sol - vents , and the culture medium are investigated . MATERIALS AND METHODS Yeast strains . The brewing yeast strains Saccharomyces cerevisiae MUCL 38475 ( top fermenting ) and Saccharomyces carlsbergensis MUCL 28285 ( bottom fermenting ) have been kindly supplied by J . - P . Dufour ( Laboratory of Brewing Science and Technology , Universite´ Catholique de Louvain , Louvain - la - Neuve , Belgium ) . Culture . The yeasts were stored in 25 % ( vol / vol ) glycerol at (cid:50) 20 (cid:56) C . Cells were plated in a petri dish on solid medium ( 1 % [ wt / vol ] yeast extract , 3 % [ wt / vol ] glucose , 2 . 5 % [ wt / vol ] agar ) and incubated at 30 (cid:56) C for 3 days . The plates were stored at 4 (cid:56) C and repitched every 3 weeks . The culture broth contained 2 % ( wt / vol ) yeast extract and 5 % ( wt / vol ) glucose ( pH of the medium unadjusted , about 6 . 5 ) . The cells were cultivated in two steps as described by Kihn et al . ( 28 ) . Two or three colonies from the solid medium plate were used as inoculum for the preculture . The stationary growth phase was reached after about 14 h for top strain MUCL 38475 ( grown at 30 (cid:56) C ) and after about 3 days for bottom strain MUCL 28285 ( grown at 10 (cid:56) C ) . Cells of the exponential growth phase ( hereafter called exponential cells ) were harvested after 10 h and 2 days of culture for the top and the bottom strains , respectively ; cells of the stationary growth phase * Corresponding author .

The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with cold distilled water . Microelectrophoresis . The electrophoretic mobility of the cells was deter - mined with a Zetasizer III ( Malvern Instruments , Malvern , England ) and with a Laser Zee Meter , model 500 ( Pen Kem , Bedford Hills , N . Y . ) . Cells of the last pellet were resuspended in 1 or 10 mM KNO 3 to a concentration of 5 (cid:51) 10 6 cells per ml . The pH was adjusted with HNO 3 or KOH . For pH values below 6 , the pH of the suspension did not change during the measurement ; at higher pH values , the pH dropped as a function of time . The pH of the suspension was determined before and after the measurement , and the mean value was used for plotting the results . In the Malvern Zetasizer III , the measurements were per - formed at one of the stationary layers of the quartz capillary . For each pH value , at least three samples were injected into the capillary and measured for 10 s at an applied voltage of 150 V . In the Pen Kem Laser Zee 500 , the measurements were performed at both the upper and lower stationary levels of the rectangular poly ( methylmetacrylate ) chamber ; for each suspension , at least three measure - ments were performed at each level . The applied voltage was 90 V ; a complete determination at a given pH took about 2 min . Contact angle measurements . The hydrophobicity of the cells was estimated by measurement of the water contact angle on a lawn of cells ( 38 ) . The cellular lawn was prepared by collecting 10 ml of a suspension of 2 (cid:51) 10 8 cells per ml on a ﬁlter ( 4 . 5 cm in diameter ) with a pore diameter of 0 . 45 (cid:109) m ( type HAWP ﬁlter ; Millipore ) ; this gave a lawn about 30 layers thick for the cells used . In order to standardize the moisture content , the ﬁlters with the cells were placed for 30 min in a petri dish containing 1 % ( wt / vol ) agar and 10 % ( vol / vol ) glycerol . The ﬁlters were mounted on a microscope slide with double - sided adhesive tape . Contact angles were measured as a function of drying time of the cellular lawns in air . The contact angles increased with drying time until a plateau was reached ( after about 3 h ) ; this was done for several independent cultures . The angles reported in this work are mean plateau values of the different independent measurements ; the conﬁdence intervals were calculated at the 95 % conﬁdence level . Surface analysis by XPS . XPS provides a chemical analysis of the outermost layer ( 2 to 10 nm ) of the analyzed solid ; information about the principle of the technique and its application to microorganisms can be found in the literature ( 47 , 48 ) . The surface analysis was performed on freeze - dried cells . One milliliter of a cell suspension ( about 3 (cid:51) 10 9 cells per ml ) was deposited in a glass ﬂask ( with a diameter and a height of 2 . 5 cm each ) . The ﬂasks were kept in liquid nitrogen for 15 min ; they were then either placed immediately in a freeze - dryer ( Lyovac GT4 , Thermovac TM 22052 ; Leybold Heraeus ) with the shelf temperature set at (cid:50) 50 (cid:56) C or stored in a freezer at (cid:50) 80 (cid:56) C until freeze - drying . In each freeze - drying operation , dry sorbitol powder was included as a control for surface contamina - tion . The chamber was evacuated ; when the pressure reached about 100 Pa , the shelf temperature was raised to (cid:50) 10 (cid:56) C in about 30 min , and the specimens were dehydrated under a vacuum of about 60 Pa . After one night , the shelf temper - ature was raised to 25 (cid:56) C , the chamber was connected to atmospheric pressure , and the ﬂasks were stoppered and stored at room temperature in a desiccator containing silica gel . The dried samples were homogenized with a spatula . A stainless - steel trough with an inner diameter of 4 mm was ﬁlled with the powder , which was gently compacted with a spatula . A polyacetal cylinder ( Delrin ) , cleaned with isopro - panol , was placed on the trough and pressed to obtain a smooth surface . The samples were mounted on a multispecimen carousel , which could accommodate up to 23 samples . The XPS analyses were performed with an SSI X - Probe ( SSX - 100 / 206 ) pho - toelectron spectrometer from Fisons , interfaced with a Hewlett - Packard 9000 / 310 computer ( monochromatized A1 K (cid:97) radiation ; spot size , 1 , 000 (cid:109) m ; anode powered at 10 kV and about 17 mA ; ﬂood gun energy set at 6 eV ) . The constant pass energy in the hemispherical analyzer was 150 eV for survey analysis and 50 eV for individual peak analysis , giving full widths at half - maximum of the Au 4f7 / 2 peak of about 1 . 66 and 0 . 98 eV , respectively . Unless stated otherwise , the fol - lowing sequences of spectra were recorded : for yeast cells , C 1s , O 1s , N 1s , P 2p , K 2p , and a survey spectrum ; for sorbitol , C 1s , O 1s , and a survey spectrum . The binding energies were determined by setting the C O ( C , H ) component of the C 1s peak to 284 . 8 eV ( 40 ) . The background was subtracted linearly . The ratios of atomic concentrations were calculated by using the sensitivity factors proposed by the manufacturer ( mean free path varying according to the 0 . 7th power of the photoelectron kinetic energy ; Scoﬁeld cross sections [ 49 ] ; transmis - sion function assumed to be constant ) . From the atomic concentration ratios , the mole fractions of the various elements , excluding hydrogen , could be computed . Decomposition of the peaks was done by using the SSI least - squares , best - ﬁtting routine with a Gaussian / Lorentzian ratio of 85 / 15 . In a ﬁrst ﬁtting , the initial binding energies , full width at half - maximum , and the intensity of the compo - nents were obtained without imposing constraints . For the subsequent ﬁts , the full width at half - maximum of all components of a given peak was set equal to the value of the best - resolved component , rounded to 0 . 05 eV , and a new ﬁtting was performed with this constraint . The peak components were attributed to chem - ical functions according to Rouxhet et al . ( 48 ) . Flocculation test . Flocculation was quantiﬁed by measuring the residual ab - sorbance of a yeast suspension after agitation and subsequent undisturbed stand - ing to allow ﬂoc settling . The test was based on the assay used by Kihn et al . ( 29 ) . The compounds of interest ( CaCl 2 , MgCl 2 , NaCl , ethanol or other organic compounds , and sugars ) were introduced in test tubes ( 16 by 100 mm ) as concentrated solutions ; HCl , NaOH , or a buffer ( sodium acetate - acetic acid or sodium citrate - citric acid ) was added to adjust the pH . Distilled water ( or culture medium ) was added to a ﬁnal volume of 5 ml . The yeast cells were then added ( as a concentrated suspension of about 4 (cid:51) 10 9 cells per ml ) under whirl mixing ( 5 s ) ; their ﬁnal concentration in the test tubes was 10 8 cells per ml . The range of ionic strengths used in the ﬂocculation tests included the ionic strength of the culture medium , estimated to be about 20 mM ( based on the concentrations of calcium , magnesium , sodium , and potassium [ 34 ] ) , in agreement with a conduc - tivity of 3 mS cm (cid:50) 1 . The tubes were agitated upside down at 25 rpm for 15 min and allowed to stand undisturbed for 15 min . Finally , the A 660 was measured ( Bausch and Lomb Spectronic 700 spectrometer ) . Analysis of the culture medium . The total calcium concentration was mea - sured by atomic absorption ( Varian Techtron AA - 5 ) , using the standard addition method . The culture medium was centrifuged ( 15 , 000 rpm , 5 min ) , ﬁltered under vacuum ( 0 . 22 - (cid:109) m pore size , type GSWP ﬁlter ; Millipore ) , diluted by a factor of 2 in 1 M HCl , and ﬁltered again ( 0 . 45 - (cid:109) m pore size , type HAWP ﬁlter ; Milli - pore ) . Ten milliliters of the solution was transferred to a 20 - ml volumetric ﬂask , and LaCl 3 ( spectral buffer ) was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 % . The free calcium activity was measured by potentiometry , using a membrane electrode speciﬁc for calcium ions ( Philips IS 561 - Ca 2 (cid:49) ) and a double - junction calomel electrode ( Philips RH 44 / 2 - SD / 1 ) , with a Philips PW 9421 digital volt - meter . The electrodes were stored in 10 (cid:50) 3 M CaCl 2 . Preliminary tests were carried out at 5 and 21 (cid:56) C as it was feared that upon warming following transfer from 10 (cid:56) C to room temperature , the culture medium would be subject to a loss of CO 2 and thus to a change of pH and ( free Ca 2 (cid:49) ) / ( complexed Ca 2 (cid:49) ) equilibria . The results obtained at the two temperatures were the same , and all of the following measurements were carried out at 21 (cid:56) C . Aqueous solutions of CaCl 2 were used to obtain a calibration curve of measured potential versus Ca 2 (cid:49) activity ; concentrations of calcium were converted into activities by using the Debye - Hu¨ckel equation . The inﬂuence of ionic strength was tested by adding 25 mM , 100 mM , 1 M , or 2 M KCl or 100 mM NH 4 Cl ; similar curves were obtained in all cases . The calibration curve of potential versus activity with 25 mM KCl was used because this solution has an electrical conductivity close to that of the culture medium ( 3 mS / cm ) . Thus , a plot which covered a calcium activity range of 3 (cid:51) 10 (cid:50) 6 to 0 . 02 M with a slope of 29 . 1 (cid:54) 1 . 2 mV per log activity unit was obtained . The pH of the standard CaCl 2 solutions was not adjusted ; it was found that the measured potentials were not inﬂuenced by pH in the range of interest ( 4 . 5 to 6 . 5 ) . The reproducibility ( deﬁned as the standard deviation of measured potential of a 0 . 5 M solution , obtained when the electrode is transferred three times from a 0 . 5 to a 0 . 05 M solution ) was 0 . 2 mV ; the activity detection limit was 2 (cid:51) 10 (cid:50) 6 M . The glucose concentration was determined according to the method of Dubois et al . ( 12 ) ; the results may contain a small contribution from reducing groups of other carbohydrates . All measurements were performed in triplicate . The ethanol concentration was determined with a test kit ( Boehringer Mann - heim 123 960 [ 8 ] ) . Similar calibration curves were obtained with solutions in water and in culture medium , with or without pretreatment by HClO 4 , which eliminates possible interfering proteins . Surface tension measurements . The surface tensions of several organic com - pound - water mixtures were determined by the ring method ( Interfacial Tensi - ometer K 8600 ; Kru¨ss , Hamburg , Germany ) . Each value represents the mean of ﬁve measurements ; conﬁdence intervals are given at the 95 % level . Chemicals . Yeast extract was obtained from Difco ( 0127 - 01 - 7 ) , and agar was from the Pasteur Institute ( Pastagar A ) . All of the following products used were analytical grade , unless stated otherwise : HNO 3 , KOH , HCl , NaOH , KNO 3 , KCl , NH 4 Cl , CaCl 2 dihydrate , MgCl 2 hexahydrate ( 99 % ) , NaCl , EDTA - tetrasodium salt dihydrate ( 98 % ) , D - ( (cid:49) ) - glucose , D - ( (cid:49) ) - mannose ( 99 % ) , (cid:97) - methyl - D - man - nopyranoside ( 99 % ) , p - nitrophenyl - (cid:97) - D - mannoside , phenyl - (cid:97) - D - mannoside , n - octyl - (cid:97) - D - mannoside , D - ( (cid:49) ) - galactose , D - ( (cid:49) ) - maltose monohydrate , sorbitol , glycerol , methanol , ethanol , n - propanol , isopropanol , n - butanol , 1 , 2 - propylene - glycol , 2 , 3 - butanediol , acetone , sodium acetate ( anhydrous ) , acetic acid , triso - dium citrate dihydrate , and citric acid . RESULTS ( i ) Flocculation . Cells of the exponential and stationary growth phases of the two strains were submitted to the ﬂoccu - lation test in order to examine the inﬂuence of the following factors : calcium , magnesium , sodium , pH , organic solvents , sugars , and the culture medium . Inﬂuence of calcium . The inﬂuence of calcium on the ﬂoc - culation of cells of different ages at pH 4 ( 10 mM acetate buffer ) is shown in Fig . 1A and B . For the stationary cells of the bottom strain , the addition of CaCl 2 ( about 0 . 1 mM ) was needed to produce ﬂocculation ; this was not appreciably inﬂu - enced by the culture time , provided the latter was at least 3 days . On the other hand , the top strain ﬂocculated without V OL . 61 , 1995 INTERACTIONS IN YEAST CELL FLOCCULATION 719 calcium addition . However , upon addition of 50 mM EDTA at pH 4 ( results not shown ) , the ﬂocs were completely redis - persed . This indicates that while ﬂocculation does not require addition of calcium , it involves calcium or other cations re - leased by the cells . For the two strains , exponential cells did not ﬂocculate upon CaCl 2 addition up to 100 mM . If the pH of the suspensions was set at 5 . 2 ( which is the pH of the growth medium in the stationary growth phase of the top and bottom strain cultures ) with 10 mM acetate buffer , the results for the bottom strain ( not shown ) were identical to those at pH 4 . For the top strain , however , no ﬂocculation occurred over the whole range of CaCl 2 concentrations ( up to 100 mM ) . Similar results were obtained when the pH was adjusted to 4 or 5 . 2 with HCl instead of buffer ( results not shown ) . Inﬂuence of pH . The inﬂuence of pH on ﬂocculation is presented in Fig . 1C and D . CaCl 2 was added to a ﬁnal con - centration of 0 . 5 mM for the top strain and 5 mM for the bottom strain . For the two strains , the exponential cells did not ﬂocculate in the pH range investigated . Stationary cells ﬂoc - culated only in a narrow pH range : from pH 3 to 4 . 5 for the top strain and from pH 3 . 5 to 6 for the bottom strain . For the top strain , no ﬂocculation occurred at pH 5 . 2 , which is the pH of the growth medium in the stationary growth phase . For both strains the pH range of ﬂocculation was not strongly affected by the nature of the electrolyte used to set the pH : HCl , 10 mM acetate buffer , or 5 mM citrate buffer . Inﬂuence of ethanol . The inﬂuence of ethanol on ﬂoccula - tion of the two strains at pH 5 . 2 ( 10 mM acetate buffer ) is shown in Fig . 1E and F . Cells of the exponential growth phase did not ﬂocculate upon ethanol addition . For the stationary cells , the results differed from one strain to another . Floccu - lation of the bottom strain was not inﬂuenced by ethanol re - gardless of the calcium concentration ( Fig . 1F ) . For the top strain , ﬂocculation was induced at 5 % ( vol / vol ) ethanol when no calcium was added and at a slightly lower ethanol concentration when calcium was added ( Fig . 1E ) . If the pH was adjusted to 5 . 2 with HCl instead of buffer , thereby maintaining a low ionic strength , ﬂocculation in 10 % ( vol / vol ) ethanol was only observed when CaCl 2 was added at 1 mM or more ( results not shown ) . This points to the importance of ionic strength for ﬂocculation of the top strain at pH 5 . 2 in the presence of ethanol . Combined effect of ethanol and pH . The combined effect of ethanol and pH on the ﬂocculation of stationary cells of the top strain in acetate buffer is shown in Fig . 2 ( closed symbols ) . Upon addition of ethanol , the pH range in which ﬂocculation occurred was broadened . When no CaCl 2 was added , the pH proﬁles obtained with 0 and 5 % ( vol / vol ) ethanol ( results not shown ) were the same as those shown in Fig . 2 ( closed sym - bols ) . At ethanol concentrations of 5 or 10 % ( vol / vol ) , the pH interval in which ﬂocculation occurred included the pH of the culture medium in the stationary phase ( 5 . 2 ) . This points to the requirement of a sufﬁcient concentration of ethanol for ﬂoc - culation of the top strain to occur during fermentation . At pH 5 . 2 in the presence of 5 % ( vol / vol ) ethanol and with no addi - tion of CaCl 2 , total deﬂocculation was observed upon addition of 5 mM EDTA , demonstrating the speciﬁc role of CaCl 2 or other cations . If the pH was adjusted with HCl and no calcium was added ( Fig . 2 , open symbols ) , the extension of the range of ﬂoccula - tion towards a higher pH was less important than that with the acetate buffer , and no ﬂocculation occurred at pH 5 . 2 in 5 % FIG . 1 .

The inﬂuence of other ions ( mag - nesium and sodium ) on the ﬂocculation of stationary cells of the two strains was investigated in buffered ( Fig . 3C and D ) and nonbuffered ( Fig . 3A and B ) systems at pH 5 to 5 . 2 . For the top strain ( Fig . 3A and C ) , ethanol was added at a con - centration of 5 % ( vol / vol ) . When the pH was adjusted with HCl ( Fig . 3A ) , both CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 induced ﬂocculation at a concentration of about 0 . 5 to 1 mM ; the ﬂocs redispersed partially in 100 mM MgCl 2 . For sodium , the results were not reproducible . In the buffered system ( Fig . 3C ) , 10 mM EDTA was added in order to avoid ﬂocculation in ethanol in the absence of additional salt . Flocculation was provoked by the addition of 1 mM CaCl 2 or 10 mM MgCl 2 , but not by NaCl up to 200 mM . For the bottom strain , the inﬂuences of calcium , magnesium , and sodium ions on ﬂocculation were similar in the buffered ( Fig . 3D ) and the nonbuffered ( Fig . 3B ) systems : CaCl 2 in - duced complete ﬂocculation at a concentration of about 0 . 5 mM , in agreement with the results shown in Fig . 1B , whereas only partial ﬂocculation occurred in 100 mM MgCl 2 and no ﬂocculation was observed with NaCl concentrations up to 200 mM . Effect of different organic solvents . The effects of different organic solvents as inducers of ﬂocculation of stationary cells of the top strain at pH 5 . 2 ( 10 mM acetate buffer ; 5 mM CaCl 2 added ) are shown in Fig . 4A and B . The efﬁciency of mono - functional aliphatic alcohols in inducing ﬂocculation increased in the following order : methanol , ethanol , n - propanol , and n - butanol . Isopropanol was less effective than n - propanol and as effective as ethanol . Alcohols with two hydroxyl ( 1 , 2 - pro - pyleneglycol and 2 , 3 - butanediol ) or three hydroxyl ( glycerol ) functions had little or no effect ; 1 , 2 - propyleneglycol was as effective as methanol . The effect of acetone was comparable to that of methanol . In order to compare more closely the efﬁciency of the or - ganic compounds in inducing ﬂocculation , the concentration required to obtain a residual absorbance of 1 in the ﬂoccula - tion test is given in Table 1 , together with the dielectric con - stant and the surface tension of the pure compounds . There seems to be a correlation between the efﬁciency of the organic compound and its dielectric constant for the series methanol , ethanol , n - propanol , and n - butanol ; however , no correlation is found if all of the compounds used are considered . Similarly , no correlation with the surface tension of the pure organic compound is found . In order to relate ﬂocculation to the properties of the liquid phase , surface tensions were determined for mixtures of pure FIG . 3 .

It appears that with the exception of 2 , 3 - butanediol , the organic solvents all have the same effect if the surface tension of their mixture with water is taken into consideration . This is also shown in Table 1 , which lists the surface tensions of the mixtures at the critical concentration . Flocculation was induced if the surface tension dropped below a value near 65 mJ / m 2 for the series methanol , ethanol , n - propanol , and n - butanol . For isopropanol , acetone , and 1 , 2 - propyleneglycol , the critical value appeared to be slightly lower , i . e . , about 60 mJ / m 2 . Glycerol did not induce ﬂoccula - tion , as the surface tension of all glycerol - water mixtures tested remained higher than 65 mJ / m 2 . The effect of 2 , 3 - butanediol does not follow the rule observed for the other compounds ; in this case , no ﬂocculation occurred even though the surface tensions of the mixtures used were far below 60 mJ / m 2 . The effect of n - butanol on ﬂocculation of stationary cells of the bottom strain was tested in the presence and in the absence of 5 mM CaCl 2 ( 10 mM acetate buffer , pH 5 . 2 ) . The addition of n - butanol up to a concentration of 400 mM had no effect on ﬂocculation of this strain ( results not shown ) . Inﬂuence of sugars . The inﬂuence of sugars on ﬂocculation of stationary cells at pH 4 ( 10 mM acetate buffer ) was tested . The addition of up to 500 mM glucose , mannose , CH 3 - man - nose , or galactose did not affect ﬂocculation of the top strain ( 0 . 5 mM CaCl 2 added [ results not shown ] ) . For the bottom strain ( 5 mM CaCl 2 added ) , on the contrary , inhibition of ﬂocculation occurred after the addition of 50 to 500 mM CH 3 - mannose , mannose , maltose , or glucose but not galactose . This conﬁrmed results previously published by Masy et al . ( 33 ) and Kihn et al . ( 28 ) for the same strain . The inﬂuence of sugars and derivatives with a hydrophobic substituent was also tested on stationary cells of the bottom strain at pH 5 . 2 ( 10 mM acetate buffer ; 5 mM CaCl 2 added ) . The inhibition of ﬂocculation by 500 mM glucose and man - nose , and the lack of inhibition by galactose , was again ob - served . Inhibition was found with phenyl - (cid:97) - D - mannoside ( about 10 mM ) and p - nitrophenyl - (cid:97) - D - mannoside ( about 10 mM ) and not with n - octyl - (cid:97) - D - glucopyranoside ( results not shown ) . None of these compounds was found to inhibit ﬂoc - culation of the top strain at pH 5 . 2 ( 10 mM acetate buffer ; 5 mM CaCl 2 added ) in the presence of ethanol . Inﬂuence of culture medium composition . The direct inﬂu - ence of the culture medium composition on ﬂocculation was investigated by submitting exponential and stationary cells to a ﬂocculation test in which , instead of using water , the cells were resuspended in fresh medium , in culture medium separated from a culture in the exponential growth phase , or in medium separated from a culture in the stationary growth phase . The results are shown in Fig . 5A and B for the top and the bottom strains , respectively . For the two strains , exponential cells did not ﬂocculate regardless of the medium used , and stationary cells did not ﬂocculate when resuspended in fresh medium . Stationary cells of the top strain ﬂocculated partially in me - dium separated from an exponential culture and completely in medium separated from a stationary culture . Stationary cells of the bottom strain ﬂocculated only in medium separated from a stationary culture ( 3 days of culture or more ) . Thus , besides the cell physiological state , the ‘‘actual’’ medium composition was important for ﬂocculation . For the two strains , the activity of free Ca 2 (cid:49) and the con - centrations of calcium , ethanol , and glucose were determined in fresh medium and in media separated from cultures at different growth phases . The results are presented in Table 2 . In the fresh medium , a total calcium concentration of 350 (cid:109) M was found ; the free Ca 2 (cid:49) activity was about 68 (cid:109) M . In the exponential phase , little calcium was consumed ; in the station - ary phase , the total calcium concentration decreased to about 220 (cid:109) M and the free Ca 2 (cid:49) activity dropped to 30 and 15 (cid:109) M for the top and bottom strains , respectively . The sugar concen - tration in the culture medium of the two strains dropped to about 32 g / liter in the exponential growth phase and about 3 g / liter in the stationary phase . Ethanol was formed at concen - trations of about 1 . 3 to 1 . 9 and 2 . 3 to 3 . 9 % ( vol / vol ) in the exponential and stationary phases , respectively . To test whether ﬂocculation of the top strain was caused by the appearance of ethanol ( shown above to be a possible in - ducer of ﬂocculation ) in the medium or by the disappearance of an inhibitor present in the fresh medium , the ﬂocculation test was repeated with the three media , adding ethanol to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 , 5 , or 10 % ( vol / vol ) . Figure 6A pre - sents the absorbance of the cell suspension against the added ethanol concentration ; in Fig . 6B , the same results are plotted against the total ethanol concentration ( added ethanol plus ethanol already present in the culture medium [ Table 2 ] ) . The results show that stationary cells ﬂocculated in the fresh me - dium provided the ethanol concentration was at least 3 % ( vol / vol ) regardless of the freshness of the medium ; thus , no inhib - itor was present in the fresh culture medium . The exponential cells did not ﬂocculate in any of the media supplemented with ethanol up to 10 % ( vol / vol ) . ( ii ) Surface properties . Electrophoretic mobilities were measured as a function of pH for stationary cells of the top strain and the bottom strain in 1 and 10 mM KNO 3 . The two FIG . 5 .

The isoelectric point was near 2 for the bottom strain and about 4 for the top strain . At pH 5 . 2 , the pH of the culture medium in the station - ary phase , the two strains had comparable electrophoretic mo - bilities , i . e . , about (cid:50) 1 . 1 (cid:51) 10 (cid:50) 8 and (cid:50) 0 . 5 (cid:51) 10 (cid:50) 8 m 2 V (cid:50) 1 s (cid:50) 1 in 1 and 10 mM KNO 3 , respectively . However , at pH 7 . 5 and low ionic strength ( 1 mM KNO 3 ) , the electrophoretic mobili - ties were (cid:50) 2 . 0 (cid:51) 10 (cid:50) 8 and (cid:50) 1 . 3 (cid:51) 10 (cid:50) 8 m 2 V (cid:50) 1 s (cid:50) 1 for the top and bottom strains , respectively . The electrophoretic mobility can be converted into zeta po - tential by the Smoluchowski equation : zeta potential ( mV ) (cid:53) 12 . 9 (cid:51) electrophoretic mobility ( 10 (cid:50) 8 m 2 V (cid:50) 1 s (cid:50) 1 ) at 25 (cid:56) C ( 23 ) ; this equation is valid when the particle radius is much larger than the Debye length . At pH 5 . 2 and ionic strength 10 mM ( Fig . 7C and D ) , the zeta potential covers a range of (cid:50) 5 to (cid:50) 12 mV . Zeta potentials of yeasts in the literature are mostly higher than those measured here : values in the range of (cid:50) 7 to (cid:50) 56 mV at ionic strengths of 10 to 30 mM were reported ( 4 , 6 , 7 , 17 , 20 , 65 ) . For the exponential cells , the mobility curves obtained in 1 mM KNO 3 were identical to those of the stationary cells ( re - sults not shown ) . Water contact angle measurements gave the following re - sults : 73 (cid:54) 17 ( six independent experiments ) and 77 (cid:54) 12 ( nine independent experiments ) for exponential and stationary cells , respectively , of the top strain ; 21 ( two independent experi - ments ) and 31 (cid:54) 15 ( four experiments ) for exponential and stationary cells , respectively , of the bottom strain . The top strain was thus more hydrophobic than the bottom strain . For the two strains , the differences observed between the exponen - tial and stationary growth phases were not signiﬁcant . The cell surface chemical composition obtained by XPS is given in Table 3 . Mean atom fractions ( excluding hydrogen ) were calculated for samples originating from independent cul - tures . According to a Student’s t test ( 95 % conﬁdence level ) , the top strain did not show any signiﬁcant difference between the exponential and the stationary phases . For the bottom strain , a signiﬁcant decrease in surface phosphate and potas - sium concentrations was observed between the exponential and the stationary phases . When stationary cells of the top and bottom strains were compared , some signiﬁcant differences were found ( Table 3 ) . The cell surface of the top strain contained more hydrocar - bonlike carbon [ C O ( C , H ) ] , less oxygen , and more nitrogen than the cell surface of the bottom strain ; for the minor ele - ments ( P and K ) and the minor components of the major peaks ( less than 5 % mole fraction ) , no signiﬁcant differences were detected . DISCUSSION Physicochemical properties . ( i ) Surface composition and electrical properties . Differences in electrical properties be - tween the two strains were found : the top strain had a higher isoelectric point and its electrophoretic mobility seemed to be strongly dependent on pH as opposed to the bottom strain . Amory and Rouxhet ( 2 ) found systematically less negative electrophoretic mobilities below pH 5 for top - fermenting strains compared with bottom - fermenting strains ( all cultured at 30 (cid:56) C ) . They related the more negative electrophoretic mo - bility of bottom strains at pH 4 to a higher surface concentra - tion of phosphate , measured by XPS . In the present study , the difference between the surface phosphate concentrations of the top and bottom strains is not signiﬁcant . Apart from phosphate groups in phosphomannans , the elec - tric charge at yeast cell surfaces may arise from carboxylate and protonated amino groups in proteins ( 25 ) . Unfortunately , the concentrations of carboxylate and protonated amino groups at the cell surface of the strains could not be determined by XPS , as their contribution to the total signals of C 1s , O 1s , and N 1s was very small . Furthermore , in the N 1s peak , protonated amine cannot be distinguished from ammonium ions , which do not contribute to the surface charge but act as counterions for negative surface groups . There is still much controversy about the relative impor - tance of carboxylate and phosphate groups in ﬂocculation ( 26 , 31 , 32 , 36 ) . Eddy and Rudin ( 16 ) and Beavan et al . ( 3 ) attrib - uted the mobility at pH 4 to phosphate and the difference in mobility between pH 7 and pH 4 to carboxylate groups ; Bowen and Cooke ( 6 ) adopted a similar approach . However , this interpretation does not take into account the nature of the cell wall - solution interface . Deprotonation or protonation of sur - face groups changes the surface electric potential , which in turn inﬂuences the apparent equilibrium constants of acid - base reactions at the surface . On that basis , Amory and Rouxhet ( 2 ) suggested that the contribution of carboxylate groups to the surface charge was small compared with the contribution of phosphate groups . Moreover , the surface is not ion impene - trable and should be regarded as a three - dimensional gel - like structure ( 7 , 43 ) . Finally , it is not a homogeneous system , neither chemically , as proteins are distributed in the polysac - charide matrix , nor morphologically , as the surface is not nec - essarily smooth . No difference in electrical properties was found between nonﬂocculent and ﬂocculent cells of the two strains . For the bottom strain a signiﬁcant decrease in surface phosphate con - centration , and a concomitant decrease of potassium as coun - FIG . 6 .

V OL . 61 , 1995 INTERACTIONS IN YEAST CELL FLOCCULATION 723 terion , was found with culture time , but this was not reﬂected in the electrophoretic mobility . Thus , no relationship was found between electrical properties and the onset of ﬂoccula - tion . ( ii ) Surface composition and hydrophobicity . The concen - tration of hydrocarbonlike carbon is much higher than could be expected from the biochemical composition of the whole yeast cell wall ( 18 ) , and thus the question of whether this was an artefact due to sample preparation was raised . A systematic study of the effect of sample handling on XPS results , however , showed that only a minor part of hydrocarbonlike moieties could be due to artefacts ( 48 ) . Using the ratios O / C and N / C , given by XPS , and using average elemental compositions of model constituents ( 21 ) , the cell surface can be modeled roughly in terms of ‘‘polysacchar - ides , ’’ ‘‘proteins , ’’ and ‘‘hydrocarbonlike compounds’’ ( 48 ) ; the results are shown in Table 3 . The concentrations of proteins and hydrocarbon moieties are signiﬁcantly higher for the top strain than for the bottom strain . This may be related to higher water contact angle measurements revealing a greater hydrophobic - ity for the top strain . The hydrophobicity of the yeast cell surface has already been positively correlated both with the presence of proteins in the cell wall ( 27 , 53 ) and with the protein surface concentration ( 1 ) . The difference in hydrophobicity may explain the difference in behavior of these strains at the end of fermentation . The ﬂocs of the top strain associate with CO 2 bubbles and rise to the top of the fermented wort , whereas aggregates of the bot - tom strain settle down . This is supported by the relationship between ﬂotation and hydrophobicity observed for S . cerevisiae ( 63 ) . No signiﬁcant differences in hydrophobicity or surface con - centrations of proteins , polysaccharides , or hydrocarbons were found between nonﬂocculent and ﬂocculent cells . Thus , hydro - phobicity does not seem to be correlated with the onset of ﬂocculation . This is in contrast to the recent observation of a small increase of the water contact angle at the moment of initiation of ﬂocculation ( 62 ) . Flocculation behavior and ﬂocculation mechanisms . ( i ) Bot - tom - fermenting strain MUCL 28285 : factors controlling ﬂoc - culation . Flocculation of the bottom strain showed the follow - ing characteristics : occurrence in the stationary phase only , speciﬁc requirement for Ca 2 (cid:49) , inhibition at low pH , and inhi - bition by mannose , glucose , or maltose but not by galactose . This behavior corresponds with the mechanism proposed by Miki et al . ( 35 ) , in which ﬂocculation is mediated by a lectin which binds with mannose residues on adjacent cells and re - quires calcium to adopt its active conformation . Bottom strain MUCL 28285 thus belongs to the NewFlo phenotype accord - ing to the classiﬁcation of Stratford and Assinder ( 57 ) or to the GMS group according to the classiﬁcation of Masy et al . ( 33 ) . Stratford observed this phenotype predominantly for ale strains ; MUCL 28285 used in this work is a lager strain . The hypothesis of a lectinlike mechanism for this strain is further supported by the fact that the onset of ﬂocculation in the stationary growth phase is not accompanied by a change of surface properties as revealed by XPS analysis , electrophoretic mobility measurement , or contact angle measurement . Floccu - lation is thus due to more subtle modiﬁcations . Nagarajan and Umesh - Kumar ( 39 ) reported the appearance of an antigen with lectinlike function during the transition of the yeast cells from the nonﬂocculent to the ﬂocculent state . Some authors suggested that lectins and / or receptors are not present at the surface in the exponential growth phase or are already present but not accessible or operational ( 51 , 55 , 58 ) . Recently , cell surface proteins involved in ﬂocculation were isolated from S . T A B L E 3 .

Straver et al . ( 60 ) also isolated another pro - tein involved in ﬂocculation but without lectinlike activity ; the authors suggested that this ﬂocculin might act as a receptor for surface lectins . Masy et al . ( 34 ) reported a change , during the culture , of the calcium activity required to provoke ﬂocculation in water , called calcium threshold . It was found that , at the onset of ﬂocculation , the calcium threshold measured in ﬂocculation tests was close to the calcium activity in the fermented broth . The above results show that the variation of the calcium threshold ( 100 mM to 10 (cid:109) M [ Fig . 1B ] ) , a characteristic of the cells , is much stronger than the variation of calcium activity in the fermentation broth ( 53 to 15 (cid:109) M [ Table 2 ] ) . The drop of the calcium threshold might be explained by the appearance of an operational lectin in the stationary growth phase . However , Fig . 5 shows that ﬂocculation requires not only a certain physiological state of the cells but also an adequate composition of the surrounding aqueous solution . The key factor is not the calcium concentration or activity but the sugar concentration . In the culture medium the glucose concentra - tion dropped from 180 mM in the exponential growth phase to 35 mM in the stationary growth phase ( Table 2 ) , while the ﬂocculation tests showed that the inhibitory concentration was around 100 mM . Mechanism of ﬂocculation . In order to achieve a better appreciation of the interplay between nonspeciﬁc and speciﬁc interfacial interactions , the DLVO ( Derjaguin - Landau - Ver - wey - Overbeek ) theory has been used to calculate curves of the interaction energy versus the separation distance between the cell surfaces ( 65 ) . The same approach was adopted here , using a cell radius of 3 (cid:109) m and a dielectric constant of 78 . 5 ( pure water ) ; the Hamaker constant for the cell - water - cell interface was varied from 0 . 2 to 1 . 6 kT ( range of Hamaker constants across water between vesicles coated with different polysaccha - ride - protein mixtures as reported by Nir [ 42 ] ) , the zeta poten - tial was varied from (cid:50) 5 to (cid:50) 30 mV , and the ionic strength was varied from 1 to 25 mM . Figure 8 presents the height of the energy barrier and the depth of the secondary minimum for different combinations of the parameters . The DLVO theory supposes that the interacting particles are smooth spheres ; in the case of a rough surface , it may refer to the approach between two protuberances , and the results should be modiﬁed in proportion to the radius of curvature . Figure 8 shows that due to the uncertainties in the zeta potential ( range , (cid:50) 5 to (cid:50) 12 mV [ Fig . 7 ] ) and the Hamaker constant , the possibility that the energy barrier is low enough to allow ﬂocculation in the primary minimum cannot be ruled out . The potential barrier is indeed negligible for a range of situations when the zeta potential is equal to (cid:50) 5 or (cid:50) 8 mV . The results presented in Fig . 8 indicate that ﬂocculation may also occur in the secondary minimum of the interaction energy curve . The distance of the secondary minimum with respect to the surface provides a convenient evaluation of the minimal distance from which the cells can easily approach each other ( 45 ) . Table 4 gives this distance for the range of parameters selected in Fig . 8 . It is interesting that while the height of the energy barrier and the depth of the secondary minimum de - pend strongly on the physical parameters used , the distance of the secondary minimum with respect to the surface varies only a little as a function of these parameters in the range of ionic strengths ( 10 to 25 mM ) , which are relevant to the culture medium and to the solutions used for ﬂocculation tests . Flocculation of the bottom strain cannot be explained only by the action of London - van der Waals forces and double - layer repulsion ( DLVO theory ) . According to the latter model , both exponential and stationary cells would be expected to behave in the same way because they have similar surface chemical FIG . 7 .

V OL . 61 , 1995 INTERACTIONS IN YEAST CELL FLOCCULATION 725 compositions and zeta potentials . Furthermore , the observa - tion of the effect of speciﬁc interactions is not compatible with ﬂocculation in the primary minimum and requires a repulsion , either electrostatic or steric ( 5 , 28 ) . The following model can then be considered . Electrostatic repulsion could keep the cell surfaces at a distance of the order of 10 nm from each other . When the cells are in the stationary growth phase , lectins and / or macromolecular chains carrying a receptor can protrude out of the surface over that distance and bind with each other , thus provoking ﬂocculation . This scheme remains valid if the cell surface is not smooth and if the cells are bound through ﬁmbriae ( 59 ) , noting that the radius of curvature of the surfaces in contact is then much smaller . The lack of inﬂuence of the ionic strength on ﬂocculation and the fact that the optimum pH for ﬂocculation is appreciably higher than the cell isoelectric point indicate that the repulsion is not electrostatic in nature . Steric repulsion is thus probable , as suggested in the case of bacterial adhesion ( 45 ) . Considering the hydrophilic and polymeric nature of this yeast surface , it is expected that polymers ( polysaccharides ) are solvated and pro - trude from the surface . ( ii ) Top - fermenting strain MUCL 38475 : factors controlling ﬂocculation . The top strain behaves like the bottom strain in the sense that its ﬂocculation requires both a certain physio - logical state and an adequate solution composition ( Fig . 5 ) . However , other characteristics show that the process involved is of quite a different nature : ﬂocculation is not inhibited by sugars , it is induced by ethanol and other organic solvents , it takes place at the cell isoelectric point , and it does not require the addition of calcium . The cells of the stationary phase were not inhibited by any of the sugars tested , in contrast to many brewing yeast strains which are at least partially inhibited by mannose ( 55 ) . Eddy ( 13 , 15 ) found one top and two bottom strains that were not inhibited by mannose or maltose . Kihn et al . ( 28 ) and Masy and coworkers ( 33 ) reported a few strains which were not inhibited by mannose and other sugars ; they proposed a third class , besides the two classes Flo1 and New Flo deﬁned by Stratford and Assinder ( 57 ) , which was named MI ( mannose insensitive ) . The top strain thus belongs to this class . Flocculation is induced by low concentrations of ethanol ( Fig . 1E and 2 ) . In the ﬂocculation test , induction was observed between 1 and 5 % ( vol / vol ) ; in the culture medium the ethanol concentration increased from 2 % in the exponential phase to 4 % ( vol / vol ) in the stationary phase . The ethanol concentra - tion is the characteristic which makes the composition of the test solution or of the culture medium adequate for ﬂoccula - tion to occur . This is demonstrated by Fig . 6 , which shows that stationary cells ﬂocculate in fresh culture medium provided ethanol is added at a ﬁnal concentration of about 5 % ( vol / vol ) . A promoting effect of ethanol and other alcohols was reported by several authors ( 1 , 14 , 15 , 36 , 44 ) . Eddy ( 14 , 15 ) described the particular behavior of yeasts that were induced for ﬂoccu - lation by low concentrations of certain alcohols ; they were at least partly deﬂocculated by mannose or maltose . On the other hand , Kamada and Murata ( 27 ) reported an inhibition of ﬂoc - culation of a set of top and bottom yeasts by ethanol . Mechanism of ﬂocculation . Mill ( 36 ) related the ﬂocculation behavior to the dielectric constant of suspensions containing methanol , ethanol , isopropanol , acetone , and dioxane in high solvent concentration ( more than 30 % [ vol / vol ] ) ; this was ex - plained by an increase in the strength of hydrogen bonds and a decrease in ionization of salt bonds . Fletcher ( 19 ) studied the inﬂuence of low concentrations of methanol , ethanol , n - pro - panol , and n - butanol on bacterial attachment to surfaces . Whether the support was hydrophilic or hydrophobic , the least attachment was observed when the liquid surface tension was in the range of 64 to 69 mJ / m 2 ; however , this minimum was not very pronounced . Figure 4 shows that , except for 2 , 3 - butanediol , all of the solvents examined behave in the same way provided that they are compared on the basis of the decrease of the liquid surface tension : they all provoke ﬂocculation as long as the surface tension is lowered below 65 mJ / m 2 . The inﬂuence of the or - ganic solvents thus acts undoubtedly through adsorption at the cell - water interface . This might be interpreted by one of two approaches : the balance of surface energies approach ( neglect - ing electrical interactions ) or the DLVO approach ( see above ) . According to the balance of surface energies approach , the free energy of cell - cell adhesion , (cid:68) G CC , would be given by : (cid:68) G CC (cid:53) (cid:103) CC (cid:50) 2 (cid:103) CL , where (cid:103) CL and (cid:103) CC are the interfacial tensions of the cell - liquid and cell - cell interfaces , respectively . Spontaneous ﬂocculation occurs if (cid:68) G CC is negative . Decreas - ing (cid:103) CL by adsorption of organic compounds would be unfa - vorable to adhesion , and thus this model has to be rejected . As a matter of fact , electrical interactions cannot be neglected in the ﬂocculation mechanism of the top strain . This is indicated by the fact that the optimum pH of ﬂocculation is close to the cell isoelectric point and by the inﬂuence of ionic strength when the ﬂocculation takes place above the isoelectric point in the presence of ethanol . Adsorption of organic molecules can have several conse - quences in relation to the DLVO model . It will disrupt the water structure near the surface and change the dielectric constant locally ( 24 ) , and it may inﬂuence the adsorption of counterions ( 22 ) and modify the zeta potential ( 66 ) . If the yeast is considered a hydrophobic colloid , the inﬂuence of ethanol and other organic solvents may thus be attributed to TABLE 4 .

A PPL . E NVIRON . M ICROBIOL . their adsorption at the cell surface , leading to a lowered local dielectric constant and to decreased cell - cell electrical repul - sion . Unfortunately , the effect of the solvents on the electrical properties of the yeast surface could not be investigated by electrophoretic mobility measurements because , in the pres - ence of solvents , the cells ﬂocculated and sedimented in a few seconds . Let us now discuss the possible nature of the difference between stationary and exponential cells . The former ﬂoccu - late at the isoelectric point , at a higher pH in the presence of ethanol , and at a sufﬁcient ionic strength , while the latter do not ﬂocculate under the same conditions . The fact that the exponential cells do not ﬂocculate at the isoelectric point in - dicates the existence of a steric stabilization by macromolecu - lar chains protruding from the surface into the solution . The stationary cells could then differ from the exponential cells by a lower efﬁciency of the steric stabilization , due to a smaller chain length , a lower concentration , or a different structure of these polymers , without noticeable difference of surface ele - mental composition , zeta potential , and water contact angle . Table 4 shows that cell surfaces can approach one another at a distance of about 10 nm without encountering a net repul - sion . The organic solvents could exert their inﬂuence by reduc - ing cell - cell electrical repulsion . They could also decrease steric stabilization by being poorer solvents or , on the contrary , by allowing the protrusion of polymer chains carrying binding sites for nonspeciﬁc ( hydrogen bonding ) or speciﬁc interac - tions . The latter hypothesis seems more probable : since these cells have a hydrophobic surface , organic compounds will be better solvents than water . Although no inhibition by sugars was observed and no ad - dition of calcium was required for ﬂocculation , the implication of speciﬁc interactions in the ﬂocculation of the top strain cannot be ruled out . Deﬂocculation by EDTA points to a speciﬁc role for calcium or another divalent cation . In the presence of EDTA , calcium was about 1 , 000 times more ef - fective in inducing ﬂocculation than magnesium ( 10 times more magnesium needed to restore ﬂocculation ; complexing constant of EDTA for calcium of 100 times greater than that for magnesium [ 52 ] ) . In the nonbuffered system without EDTA , calcium and magnesium appeared to be equally efﬁ - cient . This apparent contradiction was also observed by Kuriyama et al . ( 30 ) . Accordingly , the role of calcium may be twofold : on the one hand , trace amounts are required to acti - vate a protein ; on the other hand , calcium contributes to re - duce electrostatic repulsion between the cells . The second role can be equally well played by magnesium . The redispersion of the cells at high magnesium concentration in the ﬂocculation test ( Fig . 3A ) may be due to competition of magnesium for the calcium binding site . The transition of the nonﬂocculent to the ﬂocculent charac - ter of the top strain at the end of the exponential growth phase may thus be attributed to changes which decrease steric stabi - lization and / or to an adhesin which is only operational in the presence of a certain concentration of ethanol . In the latter case , the adhesin is not a lectin as reported for most brewing strains ( 57 ) . Conclusion . The top and the bottom strains show different electrical properties , a different hydrophobicity , and a different surface chemical composition . They are found to ﬂocculate according to totally different mechanisms ; however , no corre - lation between the cell surface physicochemical properties and the onset of ﬂocculation is found for either strain . Flocculation of the bottom strain ( MUCL 28285 ) is gov - erned by a lectin - mediated mechanism . It is inhibited by man - nose and some other sugars , requires calcium speciﬁcally , ﬂoc - culates in a narrow pH range different from the isoelectric point , and is not inﬂuenced by ethanol . The strain can be classiﬁed in the NewFlo group as deﬁned by Stratford and Assinder ( 57 ) or in the GMS group as deﬁned by Masy et al . ( 33 ) . The onset of ﬂocculation for the bottom strain at the end of the exponential phase is controlled by the conjunction of two effects : the appearance of ‘‘active’’ lectins at the cell sur - face on the one hand , and the decrease of sugar concentrations in the solution on the other hand . Calculations of the cell - cell interaction energy by the DLVO theory do not establish ﬁrmly the existence of an energy barrier due to electrostatic repulsion between the cells . However , the observation that no ﬂoccula - tion occurs near the isoelectric point and that ﬂocculation is independent with respect to ionic strength rather point to the effect of steric repulsion . Cells of the stationary phase probably possess protruding polymers carrying lectins and / or receptor sites that can bridge two cell surfaces across a repulsion bar - rier . The top strain ( MUCL 38475 ) does not ﬂocculate according to the above mechanism . Its ﬂocculation is not inhibited by mannose , does not require the addition of calcium , and takes place at the cell isoelectric point . The transition of the non - ﬂocculent to the ﬂocculent character at the end of the expo - nential phase is controlled by the conjunction of two effects : a change of the cell surface on the one hand and an increase of ethanol concentration on the other hand . Low concentrations of ethanol broaden the range of pH in which the cells ﬂoccu - late , and under these conditions , ﬂocculation is favored by an increase of ionic strength . Other alcohols have the same effect as ethanol when the comparison is made at constant solution surface tension . Adsorbed organic solvents may induce ﬂoccu - lation by reducing the electrostatic repulsion between cells , by decreasing steric stabilization , and / or by allowing the protru - sion of polymer chains into the liquid phase . The only evidence for an adhesin - mediated mechanism is the speciﬁc require - ment of a small amount of calcium . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS P . G .
