This role might be an adaptation speciﬁc to the unique environment at the cell cortex , or it might be fundamental , facilitating CCV formation on different membranes . Proteins of the Sla2p / Hip1R family bind to actin and clathrin at endocytic sites in yeast and mammals . We hypothesized that Hip1R might also coordinate actin assembly with clathrin budding at the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) . Using deconvolution and time - lapse microscopy , we showed that I Hip1R is present on CCVs emerging from the TGN . These vesicles contain the mannose 6 - phosphate receptor involved in targeting proteins to the lysosome , and the actin nucleating Arp2 / 3 complex . Silencing of Hip1R expression by RNAi resulted in disruption of Golgi organization and accumulation of F - actin structures associated with CCVs on the TGN . Hip1R silencing and actin poisons slowed cathepsin D exit from the TGN . These studies establish roles for Hip1R and actin in CCV budding from the TGN for lysosome biogenesis . Introduction In mammalian cells , traffic of newly synthesized hydrolases to the lysosomal compartment is dependent on clathrin and its associated adaptors functioning at the TGN ( Campbell and Rome , 1983 ; Schulze - Lohoff et al . , 1985 ) . Recruitment of clathrin triskelia to adaptor complexes at the TGN allows self - assembly of clathrin cages that direct membrane de - formation ( Brodsky et al . , 2001 ) . The cation - dependent mannose 6 - P receptor ( CD - MPR ) , which binds to mannose 6 - phosphate – modified proteins marked for delivery to lyso - somes , is one of several receptors involved in recruitment of the clathrin machinery ( Brodsky et al . , 2001 ) . The pinching off of clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) involves recruitment of the GTPase dynamin , but the fission mechanism and the nature of the force - generating machinery are not known ( Jones et al . , 1998 ) . In the recent years , it has been proposed that the actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in endocytosis , another budding event dependent on clathrin and its associated adaptors ( Engqvist - Goldstein and Drubin , 2003 ) . Actin may provide forces necessary for vesicle fission and / or propulsion of CCVs away from the plasma membrane . The involvement of actin in clathrin - mediated endocytosis might be an adaptation specific to the unique environment at the plasma membrane . Alternatively , the role of actin might be fundamental , participating in CCV formation at different membranes . We have shown that Hip1R and its yeast relative Sla2p , linker proteins that bind to actin , clathrin , and PIP2 , are required in vivo for functional association between endocytic complexes at the plasma membrane and the actin polymeriza - tion machinery ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 1999 , 2001 ) . We proposed that Hip1R and Sla2p may regulate actin polymer - ization around endocytic buds , promoting the efficient pinching off and / or movement of the plasma membrane – derived vesicles into the cytoplasm ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2004 ; unpublished data ) . Interestingly , it has been reported that short actin filaments are found in close proximity to the Golgi apparatus in mammalian cells , and that some vesicles of Golgi origin are propelled into the cytoplasm by actin polymerization ( Frischknecht et al . , 1999 ; Rozelle et al . , 2000 ; Percival et al . , 2004 ) . However , it is not clear if or how the actin cytoskeleton plays a role in trafficking events occurring at the TGN . Since many homologous proteins , including clathrin , adap - tor complexes , and dynamin , are present both at endocytic The online version of this article contains supplemental material .

Fluorescence microscopy analysis of Hip1R intracellular localization . ( A – D ) HeLa cells expressing Hip1R - GFP ( green ) ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 1999 ) were fixed and immunostained for clathrin heavy chain ( red ) and TGN46 ( blue ) .

( B ) Digital Hip1R couples actin and clathrin at the TGN | Carreno et al . 783 sites and at the TGN , we speculated that the actin cytoskele - ton might contribute to clathrin budding at the TGN , as it does at the plasma membrane during endocytosis . We pro - vide evidence that actin and Hip1R participate in trafficking from the TGN to the lysosome . Results and discussion We first assessed Hip1R localization in proximity to the TGN in HeLa cells both by immunofluorescence and by ex - pression of a GFP - tagged version of the protein ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 1999 ) . Using deconvolution microscopy followed by 3D reconstruction , we showed that both endog - enous and transfected Hip1R are present on CCVs in close contact with the TGN ( Fig . 1 , A – D ) . To analyze the dy - namics of TGN - associated Hip1R , we performed time - lapse microscopy on live cells expressing Hip1R - GFP , clathrin - light - chain - DsRed ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ) , and , as a marker of the trans - and medial - Golgi ( Llopis et al . , 1998 ) , human (cid:1) 1 , 4 - galactosyltransferase tagged with CFP ( GalT - CFP ) . We observed TGN - derived Hip1R / clathrin vesicles that move away from the TGN ( Fig . 1 , E – I ; see Video 1 , avail - able at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200403120 / DC1 ) . By analyzing Hip1R and CD - MPR dynamics in live cells , we next assessed whether the Hip1R vesicles might be involved in trafficking from the TGN to lysosomes . As de - scribed previously , CD - MPR is present on tubular - vesicular structures arising from the TGN ( Puertollano et al . , 2001 ) . Using the CFP form of the receptor ( Barbero et al . , 2002 ) , we observed that vesicles containing Hip1R - YFP colocalize with the CD - MPR tubular - vesicular structures ( Fig . 1 , J – M ; see Video 2 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200403120 / DC1 ) . We previously showed that treatment of HeLa cells with “A2” and “A3” siRNA duplexes directed against two differ - ent Hip1R nucleotide sequences leads to a specific 90 % and 40 – 60 % decrease , respectively , in Hip1R protein expression ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2004 ) . Mock - treated or control siRNA ( InvA2 ) – treated cells showed no reduction . We in - vestigated the distribution and morphology of the TGN in these cells . Immunofluorescence labeling of TGN46 showed that the knock down of Hip1R expression in HeLa cells trig - gered disruption of the characteristic perinuclear polarized TGN organization ( Fig . 2 , A – C ) . The extent of Hip1R reduction correlated with the level of TGN disruption . Treatment with the A2 or A3 duplex led to dispersion of the TGN in 79 % ( n (cid:2) 418 ) or 30 % ( n (cid:2) 282 ) of nonmitotic cells , respectively . The TGN ap - peared dispersed in only 5 % ( n (cid:2) 472 ) of the nonmitotic control cells . This TGN dispersion phenotype was not caused by microtubule disruption in Hip1R siRNA – treated cells ( unpublished data ) . We next used electron microscopy to explore the ultra - structure of the Golgi in cells treated with Hip1R siRNA ( Fig . 2 , D and E ) . Whereas the nucleus , endoplasmic reticu - lum , and mitochondria were normal in A2 cells ( unpub - lished data ) , the Golgi cisternae appeared swollen with a striking ( approximately fivefold ) accumulation of buds or vesicles with characteristic clathrin coats ( Fig . 2 , E and F ) . This swelling of the Golgi in cells treated with A2 du - plexes could be caused by the impairment of CCV traffick - ing from the TGN , breaking the balance between inward and outward membrane flux . A similar phenotype was ob - served in cells knocked down for clathrin light chain expres - sion ( Motley et al . , 2003 ) . Another characteristic of cells with reduced Hip1R expression levels was an approximately sevenfold increase in the number of structures resembling ly - sosomes ( Fig . 2 E ) . The accumulation of these structures , which also appeared enlarged relative to similar structures in control cells , could be another consequence of impaired traf - fic between the TGN and lysosomes , perhaps resulting from impaired lysosome function . Since depletion of Hip1R or its yeast homologue Sla2 can promote intimate association between actin filaments and endocytic proteins ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Engqvist - Gold - stein et al . , 2004 ) , we used fluorescent phalloidin to examine actin organization near the TGN in cells treated with Hip1R siRNA duplexes . In control cells , we detected association of actin filaments with TGN membranes using deconvolution microscopy ( Fig . 3 A and Table I ) . However , in cells treated with A2 and A3 siRNA duplexes , there was a seven or three - fold increase in the number of these associations , respectively ( Fig . 3 , B and C , and Table I ) . Strikingly , the architecture of the actin structures observed in association with the TGN in cells treated with Hip1R siRNA duplexes was very distinct from that observed in control cells . In cells depleted for Hip1R , the actin structures were substantially bigger , and they appeared as curved tails or rings ( Fig . 3 , A – C , inset ) , similar to the structures seen at endocytic sites in cells com - promised for Hip1R or Sla2p expression ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2004 ) . The association of actin with the TGN seen at low fre - quency in control cells could reflect a transient association during the dynamic process of CCV formation . This associ - ation may become deregulated in cells treated with the A2 and A3 duplexes . Perhaps Hip1R negatively regulates actin magnification of the TGN area boxed in A .

We next investigated whether the TGN - associated actin filaments are present at areas of the organelle that are special - ized for sorting to lysosomes . In control cells , F - actin was detected in association with (cid:1) 5 % of the CCVs on TGN membranes , and CCVs were detected in association with about one third of the F - actin structures on TGN mem - branes ( Fig . 3 D and Table I ) , consistent with a transient role for actin in the CCV formation . Hip1R depletion by A2 siRNA treatment led to a sixfold increase in the associa - tion of F - actin with CCVs on the TGN , and to a twofold increase in the proportion of TGN - associated actin struc - tures that localized with CCVs , supporting the hypothesis that Hip1R negatively regulates actin assembly during CCV Figure 2 .

Arrows , clathrin - coated buds or vesicles . Hip1R couples actin and clathrin at the TGN | Carreno et al . 785 formation at the TGN , and that its depletion stabilizes the association between CCVs on the TGN and F - actin ( Fig . 3 E and Table I ) . This observation suggests that actin regula - tion by Hip1R is necessary for the efficient release of CCVs from the TGN . Another possibility , however , is that this ac - tin regulation is necessary for subsequent movements of the clathrin vesicle after its release . The Arp2 / 3 complex , which promotes actin assembly by nucleating actin filaments , has been localized in the perinu - clear region ( Welch et al . , 1997 ) . However , this localization has never been analyzed in detail . Using deconvolution mi - croscopy , we showed that the Arp2 / 3 complex ( revealed by an antibody directed against its Arc21 subunit ) is localized on TGN - derived CCVs . ( Fig . 3 , F and G ) .

We propose that ac - tin assembly on the TGN is tightly controlled . The Arp2 / 3 complex stimulates assembly , while Hip1R limits assembly . To test the biological importance of our hypothesis that ac - tin assembly under regulation by Hip1R participates in traf - ficking from the TGN to lysosomes , we monitored the matu - ration of the lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D in cells treated with the A2 and InvA2 duplexes , or treated with an actin poi - son . The exit of this hydrolase from the TGN is mainly de - pendent on the clathrin machinery ( Godbold et al . , 1998 ) . Cathepsin D is present in the TGN as a pro - enzyme , pro - cathepsin D , which gets processed to an active form when it reaches endosomes . This mature form is eventually cleaved into heavy and light chains when it reaches lysosomes . A2 siRNA treatment inhibited the exit of pro - cathepsin D from the Golgi apparatus ( Fig . 4 A ) . At the end of a 4 - h chase , 56 . 8 % ( (cid:5) 6 . 8 % ) of the cathepsin D was still in its pro - enzyme form , suggesting that it is retained in the Golgi of Hip1R - depleted cells . In comparison , in control cells only 21 . 4 % ( (cid:5) 3 % ) of the hydrolase was in its pro - enzyme form after a 4 - h chase . To confirm that this effect was a specific result of the Hip1R knock down , we constructed a cell line that expresses a Hip1R cDNA that is not targeted by the A2 siRNA . When this cell line was treated with the A2 siRNA duplex , expres - sion of Hip1R carrying the silent mutation was sufficient to restore the cathepsin D maturation rate to levels seen in the same cell line treated with the InvA2 siRNA duplex ( Fig . 4 B ) , and to prevent TGN dispersion ( unpublished data ) . Depending on the cell type , a variable fraction of cathep - sin D escapes MPR sorting in the TGN and is instead mistargeted to the plasma membrane independent of the clathrin - mediated route ( Godbold et al . , 1998 ) . In cells expressing various inactive mutants of the CD - MPR , ca - thepsin D is mostly secreted because the mannose 6 - phos - phate – modified hydrolases are not sorted to the TGN – clathrin route ( Munier - Lehmann et al . , 1996 ) . We therefore collected the media in which cells treated with the A2 or InvA2 duplexes had been grown and performed cathepsin D immunoprecipitations . We did not observe any difference in the efficiency of cathepsin D secretion ( Fig . 4 C ) . The frac - tion of cathepsin D present in the media after a 4 - h chase was 40 % of the total cathepsin D under both conditions . These data indicate that cathepsin D secretion is not im - paired in cells deficient in Hip1R expression . They also sug - gest that when Hip1R is depleted , cathepsin D might re - main trapped by the CD - MPR in the area of the TGN dedicated to sorting to lysosomes . Otherwise , higher levels of cathepsin D secretion might have been observed . We next tested the importance of actin for trafficking from the TGN to lysosomes . We immunoprecipitated cathepsin D from cells treated during the chase of a pulse - chase experi - Table I .

Fluorescence data for the entire cell were collected using an API Deltavision DV4 Restoration microscope , with an increment in the Z axis of 100 nm . Deconvolution was carried out using the API SoftWoRx software . The number of F - actin structures and clathrin structures in association with TGN46 was then manually determined using the blend section mode of Imaris3 . 2 ( Bitplane ) with a Z projection of 1 mm in order to identify 3D structures . Figure 4 . Effect of Hip1R depletion or Jasplakinolide treatment on cathepsin D maturation . ( A and B ) Wild - type HeLa cells or ( B ) HeLa cells stably expressing a Hip1R “rescue” cDNA were treated with A2 or InvA2 siRNA duplexes for 3 d before the pulse - chase experiment . At the indicated chase times , the cells were lysed and intracellular cathepsin D was immunoprecipitated from the lysate . ( C ) The secreted cathepsin D from cells in A was immunoprecipitated from the medium . ( D ) Wild - type HeLa cells were treated with DMSO or 10 (cid:4) g / ml Jasplakinolide during the chase . At the indicated chase times , the cells were lysed , and intracellular cathepsin D was immuno - precipitated from the lysate . White lines indicate that intervening lanes have been spliced out . Hip1R couples actin and clathrin at the TGN | Carreno et al . 787 ment with the actin poison Jasplakinolide , or with its carrier , DMSO . Jasplakinolide had a severe effect on cathepsin D maturation , with 39 % ( (cid:5) 2 % ) of the cathepsin D retained in the Golgi after a 4 - h chase . By this time , cathepsin D had completely exited from the Golgi of control cells ( Fig . 4 D ) . Two other actin poisons , cytochalasin D and latrunculin A , both caused a similar defect in cathepsin D maturation ( un - published data ) , confirming that actin dynamics are impor - tant for trafficking from the TGN to lysosomes . We have established a novel role for actin dynamics in trafficking from the TGN to lysosomes and have demon - strated that Hip1R is necessary for productive coupling of actin dynamics to this pathway . The importance of actin dy - namics , proteins of the Hip1R / Sla2p family , and the Arp2 / 3 complex were established previously for endocytosis in yeast and mammalian cells ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2004 ) . We propose that in addition to an endocytic role that is conserved across spe - cies , these proteins also function at the specialized area of the TGN from which CCVs bud for trafficking to lysosomes .

DNA constructs The wild - type human Hip1R cDNA was a gift from T . Suzuki ( Shinshu University School of Medicine , Matsumoto , Japan ) ( Okano et al . , 2003 ) . hsHip1R was amplified by PCR using primers that generate ClaI and NheI sites at the 5 (cid:6) and 3 (cid:6) ends , respectively . The PCR products were ligated into pIRES - Neo2 ( CLONTECH Laboratories , Inc . ) . Several silent mutations were generated in these constructs ( C2478G , C2481T , and A2484C ) in the region targeted by siRNA - A2 ( nucleotide 2473 – 2493 ) . These were created to prevent siRNA - A2 from targeting mRNA derived from the stably ex - pressed exogenous Hip1R . Constructions of Hip1R - GFP and Hip1R - YFP were described previously ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 1999 , 2001 ) . The cDNA encoding CD - MPR - CFP was a gift from S . Pfeffer ( Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , CA ) ( Barbero et al . , 2002 ) . The trans - Golgi marker pECFP - Golgi , encoding CFP fused to the NH 2 - terminal region of human (cid:1) 1 , 4 - galactosyltransferase , was purchased from CLON - TECH Laboratories , Inc . Cell culture and indirect immunofluorescence Cell culture and immunofluorescence were performed as described previ - ously ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 1999 ) . HeLa cells were grown in DME containing 10 % FBS . For immunofluorescence analysis , cells were trans - fected with siRNA on glass coverslips in 24 - well plates for 3 d . The follow - ing primary antibodies were used : anti - Hip1R antibody ( Rb # 2855 ) was used at 1 : 50 ; anti - clathrin antibody ( X22 ) ( Affinity BioReagents , Inc . ) was used at 1 : 500 ; anti – human TGN46 antibody ( Serotek ) was used at 1 : 1 , 000 ; anti – p21 - Arc : FITC antibody ( BD Transduction Laboratories ) was used at 1 : 25 . FITC - conjugated donkey anti - rabbit , FITC - or TRITC - conjugated don - key anti - mouse IgGs , and Cy5 - conjugated donkey anti - sheep were pur - chased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories and used according to the manufacturer’s directions . Texas red - X phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) was used at 1 : 500 for F - actin staining . Deconvolution microscopy and 3D reconstruction Fluorescence data were collected using an API Deltavision DV4 Restora - tion microscope . Voxels were collected at 67 - nm lateral and 100 - nm axial intervals . Deconvolution was performed using the API SoftWoRx software on a Linux 2 . 8GHz workstation . Rendering of the 3D data was performed using Imaris3 . 2 ( Bitplane ) on a Windows XP 2 . 8GHz workstation . Time - lapse microscopy HeLa cells grown on 20 - mm glass coverslips were observed 16 – 20 h after fugene 6 transfection ( Roche Diagnostics ) . The coverslips were mounted on a temperature - controlled stage . During observation , cells were main - tained in F - 12 media ( Invitrogen ) containing 5 % fetal calf serum and 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 . Cells coexpressing low levels of the XFP constructs were imaged using an API Deltavision DV4 Restoration microscope at the intervals indicated . XFP fluorescence was visualized with 400 – 1 , 000 - ms exposures . For time - lapse acquisition of dsRed - clathrin LC , Hip1R - GFP , and GalT - CFP , a time - lapse dsRed / GFP movie was acquired , enclosed be - tween two single time point acquisitions in the CFP canal . Rescue experiments Stable cell lines expressing human Hip1R were generated using standard procedures . A stable cell line expressing the vector alone was also gener - ated as a control . For rescue experiments , these stable cell lines expressing Hip1R were treated with siRNA ( invA2 , A2 ) as described above . Cathepsin D maturation Pulse - chase metabolic labeling and cathepsin D immunoprecipitations were performed on adherent HeLa cells plated on 6 - well plates as de - scribed previously with 10 mM mannose 6 - P in the media to block en - zyme recapture ( Stinchcombe et al . , 2000 ) . A rabbit anti - human cathepsin D antiserum ( DAKO Corporation ) was used for immunoprecipitations . Electron microscopy Cells were grown on Aclar plastic and then fixed as previously published ( McDonald , 1984 ) . After polymerization of the resin , the Aclar was peeled away , and cells were remounted for sectioning . Sections 60 nm thick were cut on a Leica Ultracut E microtome , post - stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate , and viewed in an FEI 12 electron microscope operating at 100 kV .
