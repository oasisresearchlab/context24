INTRODUCTION The present study is devoted to a new role of a protein p120 catenin ( p120ctn ) as a possible mediator of effects of cell - cell contact on the actin cytoskeleton and cell motility . p120ctn , a member of the Armadillo family ( Anastasiadis and Reynolds , 2000 ) , initially described as a target of Src and ﬁrst named p120Cas ( Reynolds et al . , 1989 ) , is a ubiquitous protein expressed in many cell types . Several tissue - speciﬁc isoforms of p120ctn resulting from differential splicing are known ( Keirsebilck et al . , 1998 ) . In addition , d - catenin ( Lu et al . , 1999 ) and ARVCF ( Sirotkin et al . , 1997 ; Mariner et al . , 2000 ) , which are encoded by different genes , demonstrate a high degree of homology with p120ctn . A characteristic feature of the p120ctn is its ability to bind cadherins ( Reynolds et al . , 1994 ; Daniel and Reynolds , 1995 ; Shibamoto et al . , 1995 ; Staddon et al . , 1995 ) at the juxtamembrane site of the cytoplasmic tail of the cadherin molecule ( Yap et al . , 1998 ; Ohkubo and Ozawa , 1999 ) . This site is conserved among type I ( classical ) and type II cadherins ( Chen et al . , 1997 ; Ohkubo and Ozawa , 1999 ; Anastasiadis and Reynolds , 2000 ) and is separate from the b - / g - catenin binding site localized at the C terminus of cadherin molecule ( Nagafuchi and Takeichi , 1988 ; Stappert and Kemler , 1994 ) . The function of p120ctn is not well understood . Since p120ctn interacts with cadherins and localizes to adherens junctions , previous studies focused on investigation of the role of p120ctn in the regulation of cadherin - mediated cell - cell adhesion ( for a review : Anastasiadis and Reynolds , 2000 ) . Some studies suggested that p120ctn positively regulates cadherin clustering in the plasma membrane ( Yap et al . , 1998 ) and cell - cell junction formation ( Yap et al . , 1998 ; Thoreson et al . , 2000 ) , while other studies demonstrated an anti - adhesive effect of this protein in other cellular systems ( Ozawa and Kemler , 1998 ; Aono et al . , 1999 ; Ohkubo and Ozawa , 1999 ) . It was shown recently that p120ctn can localize in the nucleus ( van Hengel et al . , 1999 ) and interact with the transcription factor Kaiso ( Daniel and Reynolds , 1999 ) . In contrast to b - catenin , p120ctn is not involved in Wnt - signaling . Its overexpression in ventral blastomers of Xenopus did not 695 The molecular basis for contact inhibition of cell locomotion is still largely unknown . Cadherins , the major receptors mediating cell - cell adhesion , associate in the cytoplasm with armadillo family proteins , including b - and g - catenin and p120 catenin ( p120ctn ) . E - cadherin - mediated contact formation was shown to inhibit cellular motility . We examine whether p120ctn may have a role in this regulation . We show here that overexpression of p120ctn in ﬁbroblasts and epithelial cells induces pronounced changes in cell shape , motility and adhesion to the extracellular matrix . p120ctn - transfected cells display increased ﬁlopodial / lamellipodial activity , decreased contractility and focal adhesion formation , and augmented migratory ability . These effects of p120ctn are mediated by small GTPases of the Rho family . Direct assessment of the activity of these GTPases in cells expressing a 5 - fold higher level of p120ctn as compared to non - transfected control cells revealed signiﬁcant augmentation of Cdc42 and Rac activity . Moreover , co - transfection of p120ctn with dominant - negative Cdc42 and Rac , or constitutively active Rho , suppressed morphological effects of p120ctn . Confocal immunoﬂuorescence visualization of the distribution of endogenous p120ctn in dense cultures showed that formation of cadherin - mediated cell - cell contacts is accompanied by sequestering of p120ctn to the junction regions . In sparse cultures p120ctn is distributed over the cytoplasm . Co - transfection with an excess of E - cadherin leads to sequestration of exogenous p120ctn to cell - cell junctions or to small cadherin - containing vesicles , and abolishes p120ctn effects on cell morphology . Thus , p120ctn may couple the formation and disruption of cadherin - mediated contacts with regulation of cell motility by triggering pathway ( s ) affecting Rho family GTPases .

However , it speciﬁcally perturbed gastrulation , probably by affecting motility or orientation of migrating mesodermal cells ( Geis et al . , 1998 ; Paulson et al . , 1999 ) . In this study , we demonstrate a novel biological function of p120ctn . We show that p120ctn overexpression enhances formation of ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia , suppresses maturation of focal adhesions , and augments cell migratory ability . These effects of p120ctn are mediated by small GTPases of the Rho family . The effects of p120ctn can be abolished by cadherin - directed sequestration of this protein to the cell - cell junctions . Thus , p120ctn can link the assembly - disassembly of cadherin - mediated junctions with the regulation of cell morphology and motility via small Rho GTPases . MATERIALS AND METHODS cDNA constructs cDNA clones encoding mouse full - length p120ctn and the deletion mutants D N2 and D R3 - 5 ( Reynolds et al . , 1996 ) were kindly provided by Dr A . Reynolds ( Vanderbilt University , Nashville , TN ) . The D C and D N mutants ( Fig . 2I ) were PCR ampliﬁed using full - length p120ctn as a template . All these cDNAs were recloned into the EGFP - C1 vector ( Clontech Laboratories Inc . , Palo Alto , CA ) using Eco RI – Kpn I sites . cDNA encoding dominant active Rho ( Rho - V14 ) obtained from A . Hall ( University College , London , UK ) was recloned into the pCGN vector with N - terminal VSV - tag as described previously ( Helfman et al . , 1999 ) . Plasmids encoding dominant negative myc - tagged Rac and Cdc42 ( Rac N17 and Cdc42 N17 ) obtained from M . Symons ( ONYX Pharmaceuticals , Richmond , CA ) were described previously ( Qiu et al . , 1997 ) . To produce vectors for retroviral infection , DNA encoding GFP - p120ctn fusion protein was cut from pEGFPp120 expression vector by Eco 47III and Asp 718I . Insert was blunted by Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and ligated into pBabe - Puro retroviral vector ( Morgenstern and Land , 1990 ) that had been cleaved with Sna BI . Cell cultures , transfections and retroviral infection procedures Human cells of the ﬁbroblastoid line SV80 , murine NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts , Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) epithelial cells , Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells , and CHO cells stably transfected with chicken N - cadherin ( FL - 4 clone ; Levenberg et al . , 1998 ) were used . The cultures were maintained in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10 % bovine calf serum ( BCS ; Hyclone , Logan , UT ) . Transient transfections were performed using Ca 2 + - phosphate for SV80 , CHO and FL - 4 cells , or LipofectAMINE reagent ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) for MDCK cells . Cultures were examined 24 - 36 hours after transfection . Viral particles containing pBabe - GFP - p120ctn , as well as empty pBabe - Puro vectors were produced as described ( Damalas et al . , 1999 ) . NIH 3T3 cells were infected in the presence 8 m g / ml Polybrene ( Aldrich Chemical Co . ) . Infected cells were selected on puromycin containing medium ( 2 m g / ml ) and were further cultivated in the same medium . The cultures were examined about 10 days ( 2 - 3 passages ) after infection . Contractility and motility assays The traction forces exerted by substrate - attached cells were assessed using the silicone rubber substratum method ( Harris et al . , 1980 ) modiﬁed as recently described ( Burton et al . , 1999 ) . To assess the rate of cell motility , the phagokinetic track method was used ( Albrecht - Buehler , 1977 ) . Alternatively , migrating cells in sparse cultures were ﬁlmed in time lapse on a Zeiss 25 inverted microscope with a 10 · Achrostigmat phase - contrast objective , 0 . 5 · conversion lens , and 1 / 2 inch CCD video camera ( iSight Inc . , Israel ) . Growth medium was exchanged for prewarmed medium containing 25 mM Hepes and lacking sodium bicarbonate 10 minutes before observation . Recordings were made directly into a PC computer using Matrox Rainbow Runner ( Matrox Electronic Systems , Inc . Dorval , Quebec , Canada ) capture hardware . Temperature was regulated at 37°C by a home - built heated lid , and cells were ﬁlmed for 2 hours . Cell trajectories were traced interactively and the lengths of trajectories were measured using the Scion Image program ( Scion Corp . , Frederick , MD ) . Fluorescence microscopy Monoclonal antibodies to p120ctn ( pp120 Src substrate ) and E - cadherin were purchased from Transduction Laboratories ( Lexington , KY ) . Mouse monoclonal antibodies to phosphotyrosine ( clone PT66 ) , vinculin ( h - VIN 1 ) , VSV - tag , and myc - tag , rabbit antibody to b - catenin , and TRITC - labeled phalloidin were purchased from Sigma ( Sigma Israel Chemicals Ltd , Rehovot , Israel ) . Mouse monoclonal antibody to fascin was kindly provided by Dr J . Adams ( University College London ) , rabbit anti - phosphotyrosine antibody was kindly provided by Dr I . Pecht ( Weizmann Institute of Science ) . Cy - 3 - conjugated goat anti - mouse and anti - rabbit immunoglobulins and Cy - 5 - conjugated goat anti - mouse immunoglobulin were purchased from Jackson Laboratories ( West Grove , PA ) . Cells were ﬁxed and stained as described previously ( Helfman et al . , 1999 ) . For visualization of GFP - p120ctn together with other proteins , secondary antibodies conjugated with Cy - 3 was used ; for triple visualization of GFP - p120ctn and two other proteins we used double staining with mouse and rabbit primary antibody followed by staining with anti - mouse Cy - 5 - conjugated and anti - rabbit Cy - 3 - conjugated secondary antibodies . For regular as well as for wide - ﬁeld deconvolution immunoﬂuorescence microscopy we used a Zeiss ( Thornwood , NY ) Axiovert S100 ﬂuorescence microscope with a Plan - Apochromat 100 · numerical aperture 1 . 4 objective , charge - coupled device camera ( Photometrics , Tuscon , AZ ) and the Delta - Vision software package ( Applied Precision , Issaquah , WA ) on a Silicon Graphics computer ( SGI , Mountain View , CA ) . We used FITC ﬁlters to visualize GFP ﬂuorescence . Priism software kindly provided by Drs G . Tzur and Z . Kam ( Weizmann Institute of Science ) was used for quantitative ﬂuorescence intensity measurements . The deconvolution mode of the Delta - Vision permitted calculation of the ﬂuorescence from thin optical sections by subtracting the out - of - focus contributions from the remainder of the specimen . This technique was employed for the analysis of p120ctn distribution between cytoplasm and adherens junctions in the MDCK cells . Laser scanning confocal microscopy ( LSCM ) was also used for the same purpose . Fluorescent images were recorded with a Bio - Rad ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA , USA ) Radiant 2000 laser scanning confocal imaging system operated in conjunction with a Nikon ( Nikon Corporation , Tokyo , Japan ) Eclipse TLE300 inverted microscope equipped with a 63 · oil - immersion objective . Serial ( x , y ) optical sections and ( x , z ) images were recorded and analyzed using the Bio - Rad software package . Biochemical procedures A GST - pull - down assay was used to estimate the activity of small Rho family G - proteins . Constructs expressing the Rho - binding domain of rhotekin ( RBD ; Ren et al . , 1999 ) , and p21 - binding domain of PAK1 ( PBD ; Benard et al . , 1999 ) , both with GST tags in the pGEX - 5 bacterial expression vector , were kindly provided by B . Liu and K . Burridge ( University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill ) . Expressed GST - fusion proteins were puriﬁed and the GST - pull - down assay was performed as described ( Benard et al . , 1999 ; JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE 114 ( 4 ) 697 p120ctn affects cell motility via Rho GTPases Ren et al . , 1999 ) . The amount of the active small G - proteins speciﬁcally bound to their targets , GST - RBD and GST - PBD , as well as the total amount of these G - proteins in the cell lysates , were estimated by western blotting using monoclonal antibodies against RhoA ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) , Rac1 , and Cdc 42 ( Transduction Laboratories , Lexington , KY , USA ) . The amount of GFP - p120ctn and endogenous p120ctn in stably transfected NIH 3T3 cells was estimated by western blotting using anti - p120ctn antibody ( Transduction Laboratories ) and anti - GFP antibody ( Roche Molecular Biochemical , Mannheim , Germany ) . Western blotting and enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ) procedures for the detection of immunostained proteins were performed as described previously ( Bershadsky et al . , 1996 ) . The ECL autographs were quantiﬁed by densitometry using Multi - Analyst software ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA ) . RESULTS p120ctn enhances protrusion formation , reduces cell contractility and matrix adhesion and activates cell migration We ﬁrst wished to determine the effects of p120ctn overexpression on cell morphology and adhesion to extracellular matrix . We transfected SV80 and CHO cells with a plasmid encoding a green ﬂuorescent protein fusion to p120ctn ( GFP - p120ctn ) . The level of expression was evaluated by immunoﬂuorescence staining of p120ctn protein in both transfected and non - transfected cells , followed by measurement of ﬂuorescence intensity . In our transfection conditions , the mean ratio ( ± s . d . ) between p120ctn level in the transiently transfected SV80 cells and in the non - transfected cells in the same ﬁeld of view was 10±4 . In single cells lacking any contact with neighboring cells , transfected GFP - p120ctn was distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 1A , D , G , J ) . Transfected cells displayed a degree of spreading similar to control cells , but showed a signiﬁcant increase in the number of ﬁlopodia ( Fig . 1A - B and G - H versus C and I , respectively ) and lamellipodia ( Fig . 1J ) at the cell periphery . Both types of protrusions contained F - actin , and ﬁlopodia were enriched in the speciﬁc ﬁlopodial marker fascin ( Edwards and Bryan , 1995 ; Adams and Schwartz , 2000 ; Fig . 1G - H with respect to I ) . In the SV80 and CHO cells transiently transfected with p120ctn we observed a signiﬁcant suppression of stress ﬁbers ( Fig . 1A - B compared to C ) and impaired formation of mature focal adhesions ( Fig . 1D - E and J - K compared to F and L , respectively ) . The small punctate ‘focal complexes’ at the cell periphery , however , were preserved in the transfectants ( Fig . 1D - E and J - K ) . Similar results were obtained when anti - phosphotyrosine ( Fig . 1E , F , K , L ) or anti - vinculin ( not shown ) antibodies were used for the visualization of focal adhesions . When a series of p120ctn deletion mutants ( scheme in Fig . 2I ) were tested for their effects on focal adhesion formation , the partial N - terminal deletion mutant ( D N2 ) was still active ( Fig . 2A - B ) , while constructs lacking the whole N terminus ( D N ) , the 3 armadillo repeats ( D R3 - 5 ) , or the C terminus ( D C ) were no longer effective in suppressing focal adhesion formation ( Fig . 2C - H ) . It is worth noting that deletion of the C terminus of p120ctn also disturbed the localization of p120ctn in the cell , leading to its punctate distribution in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 2G ) . The decrease in focal adhesion formation suggests a reduction in cellular contractility ( Chrzanowska - Wodnicka and Burridge , 1996 ; Bershadsky et al . , 1996 ; Helfman et al . , 1999 ) . This was examined in GFP - p120ctn - transfected SV80 cells by analyzing Fig . 1 . Effects of GFP - p120ctn expression on the actin cytoskeleton , focal adhesions and protrusive activity of ﬁbroblasts . SV80 ( A - I ) or CHO cells ( J - L ) were transfected with GFP - p120ctn ( A - B , D - E , G - H , J - K ) or left untreated ( C , F , I , L ) . The cells were stained 24 - 36 hours after transfection with TRITC - phalloidin ( B , C ) , antibodies against phosphotyrosine ( E - F , K - L ) , or fascin ( H , I ) . Transfected cells that appear in B , E , H and K were visualized by GFP ﬂuorescence in A , D , G and J , respectively . Photographs in each row were taken at the same magniﬁcation . Bars , 10 m m . Note formation of numerous ﬁlopodia ( B , H ) and lamellipodia ( arrowheads in J ) and reduction of stress ﬁbers ( B ) and focal adhesions ( E , K ) in p120ctn - transfected cells . 698 the ability of cells to form wrinkles after plating on ﬂexible silicon - rubber substrates ( Harris et al . , 1980 ; Burton et al . , 1999 ) . This analysis revealed impaired contractility of cells transfected with wild - type p120ctn ( Fig . 3A - B ) , or with the D N2 mutant ( not shown ) , both of which were unable to form wrinkles . GFP alone ( Fig . 3C - D ) , or p120ctn mutants D N , D R3 - 5 and D C that did not affect focal adhesions , did not prevent wrinkle formation ( Fig . 3E ) , and thus did not impair contractility . GFP - p120ctn - transfected SV80 cells were more motile than non - transfected or GFP - transfected cells , as revealed by a phagokinetic track assay ( Albrecht - Buehler , 1977 ; Fig . 4 ) . The areas of particle - free tracks produced by migrating cells phagocytosing surface - adsorbed colloidal gold , were , on average , larger if the cells were transfected with GFP - p120ctn ( Fig . 4A - B ) than if they were transfected with GFP alone ( Fig . 4D - E ) , or non - transfected ( Fig . 4G - H ) . The mean values ( ± s . e . m . ) of the track areas produced by non - transfected cells , GFP - transfected cells , and GFP - p120ctn - transfected cells were 4806±274 , 5153±316 , and 7050±371 m m 2 , respectively ( 50 randomly selected tracks were measured in each case ) . The frequency distributions of the track areas for each cell population are presented in the Fig . 4C , F , I . Since the data are not normally distributed , we used a non - parametric Wilcoxon rank - sum test ( Montgomery and Runger , 1999 ) to estimate the signiﬁcance of the differences between these three populations . According to this test , the mean track area of the cells transfected with GFP - p120 differed signiﬁcantly from that of the cells transfected with GFP alone ( P = 0 . 000056 ) . The difference between the GFP - transfected and control , non - transfected population was not signiﬁcant ( P = 0 . 603064 ) . Dominant - negative Cdc42 and Rac and constitutively active Rho interfere with the effects of p120ctn Formation of focal adhesions and activation of cell contractility depend on the small GTPase Rho ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ; Chrzanowska - Wodnicka and Burridge , 1996 ; Kimura et al . , 1996 ) , while formation of ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia require activity of other Rho family GTPases , Cdc42 and Rac , respectively ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ; Kozma et al . , 1995 ; Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) . Rac may also induce suppression of cell contractility ( van Leeuwen et al . , 1999 ) . Phenotypic characteristics of SV80 cells transfected with GFP - p120ctn suggest that p120ctn may operate via inhibition of Rho and activation of Rac and Cdc42 . Therefore we next asked whether the effects of p120ctn can be abrogated by constitutively active Rho , or by dominant - negative Rac and Cdc42 . To this end , we ﬁrst tested whether co - expression of p120ctn with constitutively active Rho ( Rho - V14 ) abolishes the morphological effects of p120ctn . Indeed , we found that the phenotype induced by the combined transfection of cells with Rho - V14 and GFP - p120ctn was indistinguishable from that induced by Rho - V14 alone ( Fig . 5A - E ) . In both cases , transfected cells demonstrated very large focal adhesions and reduced formation of ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia . JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE 114 ( 4 ) Fig . 2 . Effects of deletion mutants of p120ctn on morphology and focal adhesions of SV80 cells . Cells were transfected with deletion mutants of p120ctn fused with GFP and were stained with anti - phosphotyrosine antibodies 36 hours after transfection . ( A , C , E , G ) GFP - ﬂuorescence , ( B , D , E , H ) phosphotyrosine staining of the corresponding ﬁelds . All images were taken with the same magniﬁcation . Bar , 10 m m . ( I ) A scheme illustrating deletion mutants of p120ctn . The N - terminal region is shown in gray , the armadillo repeats in blue and the C - terminal end in green . Note that partial deletion of N - terminal domain of p120ctn does not prevent p120ctn effects on protrusion formation and focal adhesions ( A - B ) , while deletion of the entire N terminus ( C - D ) , the 3 - 5 armadillo repeats ( E - F ) or the entire C terminus ( G - H ) completely abolishes these effects . 699 p120ctn affects cell motility via Rho GTPases We then tested whether dominant - negative variants of Rac ( Rac - N17 ) and Cdc42 ( Cdc42 - N17 ) interfere with the effects of p120ctn . We found that co - transfection of either Rac - N17 , or Cdc42 - N17 with GFP - p120ctn prevented p120ctn - induced activation of protrusion formation . Expression of Rac - N17 alone blocked cell protrusive activity but permitted the formation of ‘tangential’ focal adhesions along the cell margin ( Fig . 5F - G ) . Co - expression of Rac - N17 and GFP - p120ctn resulted in an identical phenotype ( Fig . 5H - J ) . Expression of Cdc42 - N17 alone blocked ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia formation and enhanced formation of focal adhesions ( Fig . 5K - L ) . Co - expression of Cdc42 - N17 and GFP - p120ctn produced a phenotype indistinguishable from that of cells transfected with Cdc42 - N17 alone ( Fig . 5M - O ) . Thus , the inhibitory effect of p120ctn on the formation of focal adhesions was abolished by co - expression with constitutively active Rho , while the stimulation of protrusion formation by p120ctn was blocked by co - expression with dominant - negative Rac or Cdc42 . Moreover , constitutively active Rho also prevented the effects of p120ctn on the protrusive activity of cells , while dominant negative Rac and Cdc42 blocked the disruptive effect of p120ctn on focal adhesions . These results suggest that p120ctn can affect the cell’s phenotype by acting upstream of the small GTPases of the Rho family . Overexpression of p120ctn in NIH 3T3 cells leads to activation of Cdc42 and Rac To check directly whether overexpression of p120ctn induces alterations in activities of small G - proteins Rho , Rac and Cdc42 , we employed recently developed pull - down assays ( Benard et al . , 1999 ; Ren et al . , 1999 ) , which permit the isolation of active fractions of particular G - proteins by retention on beads coated with a speciﬁc target protein that binds only the active , GTP - bound form . Since these experiments depended on comparison of pure populations of p120ctn - overexpressing and control cells , we have prepared , by retroviral infection , NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing GFP - p120ctn . The same cells infected with the retrovirus with the empty vector , carrying only the puromycin resistance gene , were used as a control . Phenotypic characteristics of the stable transfectants of NIH - 3T3 cells are summarized in Fig . 6 . Western blotting with anti - p120ctn antibody revealed one band corresponding to endogenous p120ctn in cells transfected with the empty vector ( puro ) , and two bands in GFP - p120ctn - transfected cells ( Fig . 6A , left panel ) . The upper band of these two can also be stained with an anti - GFP antibody ( Fig . 6A , right panel ) and therefore corresponds to GFP - p120ctn ( a weak lower band on this lane does not coincide with the endogenous p120ctn band and probably corresponds to a degradation product of the GFP - p120ctn ) . Comparison of the densities of the bands corresponding to endogenous and exogenous p120ctn in transfected cells demonstrated that the level of endogenous p120ctn did not change in the GFP - p120ctn - transfected cells , and the amount of GFP - p120ctn exceeded the level of endogenous protein approximately ﬁvefold . This estimation shows that the level of overexpression of p120ctn in stably transfected NIH 3T3 cells is lower than in the transiently transfected SV80 cells characterized above . Comparison of the morphology of the GFP - p120ctn - transfected NIH 3T3 cells with that of the cells transfected with empty vector ( Fig . 6B - D ) revealed signiﬁcant augmentation of lamellipodia formation in the p120ctn overexpressing NIH 3T3 Fig . 3 . p120ctn suppresses cell contractility . GFP - p120ctn transfected ( A , B ) or GFP - transfected ( C , D ) SV80 cells were plated on ﬂexible silicone - rubber ﬁlms to assess cell contractility . Transfected cells in B and D were visualized by GFP - ﬂuorescence in A and C , respectively . Bar , 10 m m . ( E ) A table summarizing the effects of p120ctn deletion mutants on cell contractility . Note that GFP - p120ctn transfected cells were unable to form wrinkles on the ﬂexible substrate , while the GFP - transfected and non - transfected cells produced wrinkles . The partial N - terminal deletion mutant ( D N2 ) preserved the ability to block contractility , while mutants with complete deletion of the N terminus ( D N ) , armadillo regions ( D R3 - 5 ) , or the C terminus ( D C ) were inactive . 700 cells ( Fig . 6C compared to B ) . Formation of ﬁlopodia was also enhanced in some cells ( not shown ) , but not in such degree as in SV80 transiently transfected with GFP - p120ctn ( Fig . 1A , B , G , H ) . Anti - phosphotyrosine staining of control , empty vector - transfected ( Fig . 6E ) and GFP - p120ctn - transfected ( Fig . 6F - G ) NIH 3T3 cells revealed that unlike transiently transfected SV80 cells , stably transfected NIH 3T3 overexpressing GFP - p120ctn still preserve elongated ( mature ) focal adhesions , although less developed than in control cells transfected with the empty vector . Direct ﬁlming of locomoting cells showed that GFP - p120ctn expression stimulates migration of NIH 3T3 cells ( Fig . 6H - K ) . The mean migration speed ( ± s . e . m . ) of these cells transfected with the empty vector ( puro ) was 26 . 3±1 . 9 m m / hour , while transfection with GFP - p120ctn increased this value to 37 . 8±2 . 6 m m / hour ( the numbers of trajectories measured were 37 and 36 respectively ) . Again , as in the case of the phagokinetic tracks of SV80 cells , frequency distributions of the migration speed values of the transfected NIH 3T3 cells differed from the normal distribution ( Fig . 6I , K ) . The non - parametric Wilcoxon rank - sum test ( Montgomery and Runger , 1999 ) revealed that the difference between the mean speeds of the NIH 3T3 cells transfected with empty vector and with GFP - p120ctn was signiﬁcant ( P = 0 . 001328 ) . Thus , although the average level of expression of the GFP - p120ctn in NIH 3T3 cells was lower than in SV80 , and some phenotypic characteristics ( e . g . effect on the focal adhesions ) were less pronounced , the stably transfected NIH 3T3 cells , similarly to transiently transfected SV80 cells , demonstrated enhanced migration ability . Comparison of the activities of small G - proteins in the NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with GFP - p120ctn with those in control , empty vector - transfected cells using the pull - down assay ( Fig . 7 ) revealed signiﬁcant augmentation of the activities of Cdc42 and Rac ( Fig . 7A , left and central panels ) . The alteration of Rho activity was insigniﬁcant ( Fig . 7A , right panels ) . Densitometric quantiﬁcation of the western blotting data ( Fig . 7B ) showed that activities of both Cdc42 and Rac increased approximately 3 - fold . Cadherin - mediated sequestering of p120ctn to adherens junctions abolishes its effects Since p120ctn is a cadherin - binding protein and , in cells that contact each other , is localized at cadherin - mediated adherens junctions ( Anastasiadis and Reynolds , 2000 ) , we studied the relationship between the interactions of p120ctn with cadherin and its effects on cell morphology and cell - matrix adhesion . First , we showed that these activities of p120ctn do not require its interaction with cadherins . In fact , p120ctn induced disruption of focal adhesions and formation of numerous lamellipodial protrusions in CHO cells ( Fig . 1J - L ) that express very low endogenous levels of cadherin ( Levenberg et al . , 1998 ) . The CHO subline FL - 4 ( Levenberg et al . , 1998 ) stably transfected with chicken N - cadherin demonstrated a very similar phenotype upon p120ctn transfection ( results not shown ) . Moreover , the results presented below suggest that the interaction of p120ctn with cadherins is not only unnecessary for the p120ctn effects on cell morphology and motility , but under certain conditions interferes with these effects . We studied distribution and phenotypic effects of p120ctn in sparse and dense cultures of epithelial MDCK cells ( Fig . 8 ) . To examine the distribution of the endogenous p120ctn , JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE 114 ( 4 ) Fig . 4 . p120ctn transfection promotes migration of SV80 cells . GFP - p120ctn transfected ( A , B ) , GFP - transfected ( D , E ) , or non - transfected ( G , H ) SV80 cells were plated on coverslips coated with colloid gold to assess cell migration .

Note that GFP - p120ctn transfected cells produce phagokinetic tracks of larger area ( B ) than GFP - transfected ( E ) or non - treated control cells ( H ) . These areas were measured for 50 cells in each case . Histograms presenting frequency distributions of phagokinetic track areas are shown for GFP - p120ctn transfected ( C ) GFP - transfected ( F ) and non - transfected ( I ) cells . 701 p120ctn affects cell motility via Rho GTPases indirect immunoﬂuorescence labeling and laser scanning confocal microscopy ( LSCM ) were used . Both ( x , y ) optical sections parallel to the substrate ( Fig . 8A , B ) and ( x , z ) images corresponding to the sections perpendicular to the substrate ( Fig . 8A ¢ , B ¢ ) were analyzed . Observations of the subconﬂuent MDCK cultures revealed , in addition to cell - cell junction staining , a signiﬁcant amount of p120ctn - speciﬁc ﬂuorescence diffusely distributed through the cytoplasm ( Fig . 8A , A ¢ ) . The LSCM , unlike regular immunoﬂuorescence microscopy , allows to visualize the ﬂuorescence in a given focal plane abolishing the background ﬂuorescence generated by the other parts of the specimen . Therefore , diffuse ﬂuorescence observed on the confocal images of the sections traversing the cytoplasm indicates that in the subconﬂuent MDCK cells signiﬁcant fraction of p120ctn is indeed localized in the cytoplasm . At the same time , the level of cytoplasmic p120ctn was very low in the dense MDCK cultures , and the protein was localized only in the cell - cell junctions ( Fig . 8B , B ¢ ) . Wide ﬁeld deconvolution epiﬂuorescence microscopy also makes it possible to visualize the distribution of ﬂuorescently labeled molecules in a given optical section , eliminating out - of - focus contributions from the remainder of the specimen ( Hiraoka et al . , 1990 ) . Application of this technique to the visualization of endogenous p120ctn revealed , similarly to LSCM , that in sparse cultures a signiﬁcant fraction of this protein is located in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 8C ) , while in dense cultures p120ctn was quantitatively sequestered in the cell - cell junctions ( Fig . 8D ) . The effects induced by transfection of MDCK with exogenous GFP - p120ctn also appear to depend on the density of the culture . Sparse MDCK cells showed localization of GFP - p120ctn in the cytoplasm , accompanied by activation of protrusion formation similar to that observed in non - epithelial cell lines ( Fig . 9A ) and apparent disruption of adherens junctions ( Fig . 9C ) . However , in transfected MDCK cells located in dense regions of the monolayer , exogenous GFP - p120ctn was sequestered in adherens junctions as visualized by staining with antibodies to b - catenin ( Fig . 9B , D ) or E - cadherin ( not shown ) . This junction - sequestered GFP - p120ctn did not affect the morphology of transfected cells ( Fig . 9B , D ) . To determine whether sequestration by cadherin can prevent the effects of p120ctn , GFP - p120ctn was co - expressed with an excess of E - cadherin in SV80 cells , which normally express N - cadherin . We found that in such double - transfected cells , GFP - p120ctn was co - localized with E - cadherin in the cell - cell junctions ( Fig . 10A , B ) , or in isolated cells , in small vesicles ( Fig . 10D , E ) . In both cases , the phenotype characteristics of the p120ctn - transfected SV80 cells , i . e . reduction in focal adhesions and augmentation of protrusive activity , were efficiently suppressed ( Fig . 10C , F ) . Thus , E - cadherin - mediated sequestration was sufficient to prevent the effects of GFP - p120ctn on morphology and adhesion of SV80 cells . DISCUSSION In this study we describe some novel effects induced by the moderate overexpression of p120ctn . The most universal effect was the augmentation of protrusive activity , e . g . enhanced formation of ﬁlopodia and / or lamellipodia that we observed in SV80 , NIH 3T3 and CHO cells , as well as in sparse cultures of MDCK cells . We have documented using the phagokinetic track assay and direct ﬁlming of live cells that overexpression of p120ctn in both SV80 and NIH 3T3 cells leads to a signiﬁcant increase in cell migration . Finally , SV80 cells demonstrating approximately 10 - fold overexpression of p120ctn had impaired Fig . 5 . Suppression of p120ctn effects by mutated Rho GTPases . SV80 ﬁbroblasts were transfected with VSV - tagged constitutively active Rho ( Rho - V14 ; A - E ) , dominant - negative myc - tagged Rac ( Rac - N17 ; F - J ) , or dominant - negative myc - tagged Cdc42 ( Cdc42 - N17 ; K - O ) without ( A - B , F - G , K - L ) or with GFP - p120ctn ( C - E , H - J , M - O ) . GFP ﬂuorescence is shown in C , H and M ; staining with anti - VSV - tag in A and D , staining with anti - myc - tag in F , I , K and N , and staining with anti - phosphotyrosine antibody in B , E , G , J , L and O . Each row corresponds to a single ﬁeld . All photographs were taken with the same magniﬁcation . Bar , 10 m m . Note that co - transfection with either constitutively active Rho or dominant negative Rac and Cdc42 completely abolished the effects of p120ctn on focal adhesions and cell morphology . 702 contractility and were not able to form large mature focal adhesions . These results conﬁrm and extend earlier observations that p120ctn overexpression at high levels induces formation of numerous dendrite - type processes in ﬁbroblasts ( Reynolds et al . , 1996 ) , and that ectopic expression of d - catenin , a protein very similar to p120ctn , results in stimulation of cell migration upon treatment with scatter - factor ( Lu et al . , 1999 ) . Preliminary analysis of the effects of deletion mutants revealed that several regions of the p120ctn molecule are important for its effect on cell adhesion and contractility . An intact armadillo repeat domain was indispensable , similarly to the situation with other armadillo family proteins . The C - terminal domain was also necessary , and our results are consistent with a suggestion that it could be involved in proper cytoplasmic localization of the p120ctn in the cell . Complete deletion of N terminus also abolished the p120ctn effect , while partial deletion , preserving the extreme N - and C - terminal parts of this domain , did not interfere with its functions . The motile characteristics of most cell types are determined by several small GTPases of the Rho - family . These trigger cytoskeletal changes determining cell protrusive activity , contractility and adhesion ( Hall , 1998 ; Nobes and Hall , 1999 ; Ridley et al . , 1999 ) . The external environment , including contacts with other cells , may regulate cell motility by affecting the activities of speciﬁc Rho GTPases . The mechanisms of external regulation of small GTPase activities are , however , poorly understood . Our results show that p120ctn can control cell motility by acting upstream of the Rho family GTPases . The most direct evidence has been obtained in experiments with NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with GFP - p120ctn . Estimation of the active fractions of small G proteins by pull - down assays revealed signiﬁcant activation of Rac and Cdc42 , without apparent alteration of Rho activity . This is consistent with the demonstrated augmentation of protrusive activity ( controlled by Rac and Cdc42 ; Ridley et al . , 1992 ; Nobes and Hall , 1995 ; Nobes and Hall , 1999 ; Brown et al . , 2000 ) , and only slight alteration in focal adhesion formation ( controlled by Rho ; Ridley and Hall , 1992 ; Hotchin and Hall , 1995 ) . Double transfection of SV80 cells with p120ctn and either dominant - negative Cdc42 , or dominant - negative Rac abolished the effects of p120ctn , which is consistent with the role of these small G - proteins as major mediators of p120ctn effects . In addition , the effects of p120ctn in SV80 cells were blocked by co - expression with constitutively active Rho , implying that p120ctn may function in these cells by suppressing endogenous Rho activity as well .

Note that the GFP - p120ctn - transfected cells demonstrate long trajectories more often than cells transfected with the empty vector . Frequency distribution of cells according to their speed range is shown in I for cells transfected with the empty vector and in K for the GFP - p120ctn - transfected cells . 703 p120ctn affects cell motility via Rho GTPases In two recent publications , effects of the overexpression of p120ctn on activity of Rho GTPases were also described ( Anastasiadis et al . , 2000 ; Noren et al . , 2000 ) . Noren et al . have demonstrated in CHO cells an increase in Rac and Cdc42 activity , similarly to our work , but in addition were able to register a decrease in Rho activity ( Noren et al . , 2000 ) . The work of Anastasiadis et al . ( Anastasiadis et al . , 2000 ) speciﬁcally stresses the inhibitory effect of p120ctn on Rho activity , in particular , the prevention of Rho activation by its classic inducer , lysophosphatidic acid . The absence of the p120ctn effect on Rho activity in our experiments with NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with GFP - p120ctn could be explained by the relatively low level of p120ctn overexpression in these cells . We did not observe in these cells ‘arborized’ or ‘stellate’ morphology typical for cells used in studies of Noren et al . and Anastasiadis et al . Moreover , we were able to reproduce the stellate phenotype in our cells by a signiﬁcant ( order of magnitude ) increase of the level of p120ctn overexpression ( data not shown ) . Transiently transfected SV80 cells , expressing a higher level of p120ctn than NIH 3T3 , demonstrated a phenotype consistent with a decrease of Rho activity . Direct activity measurements were not feasible for SV80 , however , due to the small fraction ( ~ 20 % ) of transfected cells . The activities of the various GTPases of the Rho family in living cells are highly interdependent . Activation of Cdc42 leads to activation of Rac , which in turn may lead to activation of Rho ( Hall , 1998 ; Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) . Under other conditions Cdc42 ( Kozma et al . , 1997 ) and Rac ( Sander et al . , 1999 ) may suppress Rho activity . In this study we observed an apparent growth of focal adhesions in cells expressing negative - dominant Cdc42 , suggesting an antagonistic interrelation between the active forms of Cdc42 and Rho ( Fig . 5K - L ) . Therefore , putative inhibition of Rho in the p120ctn - transfected SV80 cells could be a secondary result of the activation of Cdc42 and / or Rac in these cells . As no signiﬁcant inhibition of Rho was observed in Fig . 7 . Effect of p120ctn stable overexpression on the activity of small G - proteins of Rho family in NIH 3T3 cells . NIH 3T3 cells infected with retroviruses bearing either GFP - p120ctn or ‘puro’ empty vector were grown for 2 passages in the growth medium with 10 % BCS and 2 m g / ml puromycin . For the assay , the cells were lysed 48 hours after replating . ( A ) Activities of small G - proteins were determined by a ‘pull - down’ assay using beads coated with the PBD portion of PAK for speciﬁc binding of active Rac and Cdc42 , and RBD region of rhotekin as a speciﬁc trap for active Rho ( see Materials and Methods ) . The upper panel in each column represents an amount of active small G - protein retained by the corresponding beads ; the lower blot represents total amount of the this G - proteins in cell lysates . ( B ) – quantitative results of 3 independent measurements of small G - protein activity in NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with GFP - p120ctn or with an empty vector ( puro ) . Amount of active protein ( as in upper panel in A ) estimated by densitometry was normalized to the total amount of the corresponding protein in the cell lysate ( as in the lower panels in A ) . Results are presented as a ratio of activity of G - protein in the cells transfected with p120ctn to the activity of this protein in cells transfected with the empty vector . Note that both Cdc42 and Rac activities signiﬁcantly increase in cells stably transfected with p120ctn , while activity of Rho remains unchanged . Fig . 8 . Distribution of endogenous p120ctn in MDCK cells . Sparse ( A , A ¢ , C ) and dense ( B , B ¢ , D ) cultures were labeled with antibodies directed to p120ctn and examined by LSCM ( A , A ¢ , B , B ¢ ) , or by wide ﬁeld deconvolution microscopy ( C , D ) . Optical sections through the cytoplasm parallel to the substrate ( x , y ) are shown in ( A , B , C , D ) . Images corresponding to vertical ( x , z ) sections taken along the lines indicated in A and B are shown in A ¢ and B ¢ , respectively . All photographs were taken at the same magniﬁcation . Bar , 10 m m . Note the signiﬁcant amount of endogenous p120ctn in the cytoplasm of sparse cells , and the lack of cytoplasmic staining in the dense culture . 704 p120ctn - transfected NIH 3T3 cells , we can conclude that activation of Cdc42 and Rac is sufficient to explain the p120ctn - induced stimulation of cell migration . How are the effects of p120ctn on cell motility related to its interactions with cadherin and its localization to adherens junctions ? We have shown that the effects of p120ctn on focal contacts and protrusive activity do not depend on p120ctn - cadherin interactions , since these effects were also apparent in CHO cells that express very low levels of cadherins . Moreover , our results suggest that cadherin - mediated sequestration of p120ctn to adherens junctions prevents its effect on cell morphology . Analysis of p120ctn distribution in sparse and dense MDCK cells using LSCM and wide ﬁeld deconvolution microscopy revealed that formation and maturation of the adherens junctions is accompanied by a quantitative translocation of cytoplasmic p120ctn into cell - cell junction complexes . The mechanism of this process requires further investigation . It is possible that rapid accumulation of E - cadherin and cadherin - 6 molecules upon maturation of MDCK adherens junctions ( Stewart et al . , 2000 ) leads to an increase in the number of binding sites for p120ctn . Also post - translational modiﬁcations of p120ctn upon docking in the junctional complexes ( Thoreson et al . , 2000 ) may affect affinity of this protein to cadherin ( Roura et al . , 1999 ) . Formation of adherens junctions could thus create a sink for the withdrawal of cytoplasmic p120ctn . In our observations , introduction of exogenous GFP - p120ctn into dense MDCK cells led to its sequestration in the adherens junctions and did not permit its JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE 114 ( 4 ) Fig . 9 . GFP - p120ctn transfection of MDCK cells in sparse and dense cultures . Sparse ( A , C ) and dense ( B , D ) cultures were transfected with GFP - p120ctn and stained 36 hours later with antibody against b - catenin ( C , D ) . GFP ﬂuorescence of corresponding ﬁelds is shown in ( A , B ) . Transfected cells are marked by asterisks . Note that in the high density culture ( B , D ) GFP - p120ctn was recruited to adherens junctions and did not affect cell morphology , while in sparse regions transfection of cells with GFP - p120ctn led to disruption of cell - cell junctions and formation of numerous protrusions ( A , C ) . All photographs were taken at the same magniﬁcation . Bar , 10 m m . Fig . 10 . Suppression of p120ctn overexpression effects on cell morphology and focal adhesions by co - expression with E - cadherin . SV80 cells expressing endogenous N - cadherin were transfected with E - cadherin ( visualized by antibody staining in A and D ) , together with GFP - p120ctn ( visualized by GFP - ﬂuorescence in B and E ) , and stained with antibody against phosphotyrosine to visualize focal adhesions ( C and F ) . Each row corresponds to a single ﬁeld . All photographs were taken at the same magniﬁcation . Bar , 10 m m . Note that E - cadherin recruits p120ctn into cell - cell junctions ( A , B ) or into endocytotic vesicles ( D , E ) and suppresses the effects of p120ctn on focal adhesions and cell morphology . 705 p120ctn affects cell motility via Rho GTPases effect on cell morphology . By contrast , introduction of GFP - p120ctn into sparse cells led to an increase in its cytoplasmic concentration and permitted the morphological effects . Finally , even the effect of GFP - p120 on the morphology of ﬁbroblast - like SV80 cells can be abolished if p120ctn is co - transfected in these cells together with an excess of E - cadherin . These cells then acquire an ability to form cadherin - mediated cell - cell junctions , where a signiﬁcant fraction of cytoplasmic p120ctn could be recruited . Single cells endocytose the excess of cadherin ( Kartenbeck et al . , 1991 ; Le et al . , 1999 ) leading to recruitment of p120ctn by cadherin - containing vesicles . In both cases sequestering of cytoplasmic p120 led to abolishment of its effect on cell morphology and focal contacts . Taken together , these results allow us to propose a model that links the localization of p120ctn to the motile behavior of the cell ( Fig . 11 ) . Since p120ctn is a stable molecule , unlike b - catenin , which undergoes rapid degradation in the cytoplasm ( Aberle et al . , 1997 ; Papkoff , 1997 ; Thoreson et al . , 2000 ) , p120ctn recruitment to cell - cell junctions could be a potent mechanism for controlling its cytoplasmic level and consequently its effect on cell motility . Formation of cadherin - mediated cell - cell junctions may lead to a decrease in the cytoplasmic pool of p120ctn that , in turn , could trigger a decrease in the activities of Rac and Cdc42 and perhaps in some cases an increase in Rho activity . These changes may induce an increase in cell contractility and a decrease in protrusive activity , leading to reduced cell motility and compaction of cell - cell junctions . It is worth noting that a mutant E - cadherin , lacking an ability to recruit p120ctn into cell - cell junctions , cannot support cell compaction ( Thoreson et al . , 2000 ) . In contrast , the release of cell - cell junctions should increase intracellular levels of p120ctn , activate Cdc42 and Rac , perhaps in some cases suppress Rho , and thereby promote cell motility . This mechanism may play a role in the regulation of contact inhibition of locomotion , a phenomenon well known in many cell types ( Abercrombie , 1970 ; Heaysman , 1978 ; Harris , 1999 ) . Phenomenological descriptions of contact inhibition include a characteristic event , like ‘contact paralysis’ , e . g . inhibition of protrusion activity upon establishing of cell - cell contact ( Trinkaus et al . , 1971 ) , which can be explained in terms of changes of activities of G - proteins outlined above . Moreover , it was shown that cadherin , indeed , suppresses cell motility by a mechanism involving its juxtamembrane cytoplasmic domain recognized by p120ctn ( Chen et al . , 1997 ) . The epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( Birchmeier et al . , 1996 ; Boyer et al . , 2000 ) may also involve activation of cell motility due to release of p120ctn from cell - cell junctions into the cytoplasm . Finally , p120ctn may be involved in cancer invasion by means of its motility - promoting function . Invasive gastric carcinomas were recently shown to contain elevated cytoplasmic levels of p120ctn ( Jawhari et al . , 1999 ) , an effect consistent with our model . In conclusion , this study has demonstrated a novel function for p120ctn : the ability to control cell motility by a regulatory mechanism involving Rho - family GTPases . This new function of p120ctn provides an important link between cell - cell adhesion and cell motility . We are very grateful to A . Reynolds for p120ctn plasmids , and to B . Liu and K .
