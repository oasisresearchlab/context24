Introduction A new generation of fluorescence microscopes is capable of imaging with nanometer - scale resolution . These ‘‘super - resolu - tion’’ microscopes are now commercially available and poised to become standard fixtures in imaging facilities and laboratories worldwide [ 1 , 2 ] . Single - molecule localization microscopy such as photoactivated localization microscopy ( PALM ) [ 3 ] , stochastic optical reconstruc - tion microscopy ( STORM ) [ 4 ] , and fluorescence - PALM ( f - PALM ) [ 5 ] ( collectively referred to hereafter as ( f - ) PALM / STORM ) provide information on the positions of many individual fluorophores within the sample at high precision , producing an image with high resolution ( , 25 nm laterally [ 3 – 5 ] and , 10 – 50 nm axially [ 6 – 8 ] ) and enabling sub - diffraction limit imaging of cellular ultrastructure and quantitative analysis of protein distri - butions [ 9 ] . The highest resolutions have been obtained in fixed samples [ 4 – 7 , 10 , 11 ] but technical improvements now allow living samples to be characterized with effective frame rates on the second ( s ) timescale [ 12 , 13 ] . By comparison , SIM and stimulated emission depletion microscopy ( STED ) provide relatively high - speed image acquisi - tion [ 14 , 15 ] and also achieve sub - diffraction limit image resolu - tion . The spatial resolution of linear SIM is twice that of a conventional microscope ( i . e . , , 125 nm laterally and , 250 nm axially for visible light ) [ 16 , 17 ] , while STED obtains diffraction - unlimited resolution , achieving 40 – 70 nm resolution in three dimensions for biological samples labeled with fluorescent dyes and proteins [ 18 – 21 ] . Characterization of live - cell protein dynamics is more tractable with these techniques [ 16 , 17 , 19 , 22 , 23 ] ; however , the highest resolutions are typically obtained with fixed samples [ 3 – 5 , 7 ] . Since each super - resolution implementation has its own advantages and limitations , it would be advantageous to apply PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e51314 multiple imaging modalities to one sample . This would allow investigators to watch dynamic complexes assemble and move , while also allowing them to characterize the detailed organization of these complexes , without the need for distinct probes and labeling strategies . Different super - resolution imaging approaches would appear to require fluorescent probes with seemingly incompatible properties . ( f - ) PALM / STORM requires probes that can be switched with high contrast between two spectrally distinct states , including photoactivatable FPs [ 24 , 25 ] , photoswitchable FPs [ 26 ] , photoconvertible ( pc ) FPs [ 27 – 31 ] and organic dyes [ 4 , 10 , 32 – 34 ] . By contrast , SIM and STED are compatible with many conventional fluorophores ( e . g . , enhanced green FP ( EGFP ) ) and for these methods , high fluorophore brightness and photosta - bility are necessary for achieving the highest resolutions . Here we report a new green - to - red pcFP variant , known as mMaple , derived from the previously reported pcFP mClavGR2 [ 31 ] . Using the E . coli chemotaxis network as a model system [ 9 ] , we demonstrate that mMaple protein fusions are functional and provide brighter green state fluorescence intensity in cells than either EGFP or the widely used pcFP , mEos2 . Furthermore , we show that the combination of green - to - red photoconversion and high green state brightness allow mMaple to be used for both ( f - ) PALM / STORM and SIM . Single pcFP counting in individual bacterial cells by ( f - ) PALM / STORM reveals that a key contrib - utor to the favorable properties of mMaple is a high intracellular concentration of properly folded ( and therefore photoconvertible ) mMaple fusion proteins . Due to its improved folding efficiency and photostability , mMaple has significant advantages over other proteins currently used for super - resolution microscopy . Results and Discussion Engineering and Characterization of mMaple , a New Green - to - red pcFP Though mClavGR2 pcFP is monomeric at high concentrations [ 31 ] , we were concerned that it might have a weak tendency to dimerize , since residues 220 – 224 ( HSGLP ) are identical to the ones that form part of the dimer interface in related Anthozoa FPs [ 35 ] . Thus , we replaced residues 220 – 224 with the corresponding residues ( RNSTD ) from the close homologue mTFP1 [ 36 ] ( Fig . S1 ) . Starting from this modified mClavGR2 variant , we undertook 4 rounds of protein optimization by creating successive libraries of , 5 thousand genetic variants and screening these libraries for efficient photoconversion [ 31 ] . E . coli colonies with high brightness and an improved ratio of red fluorescence ( after photoconversion ) to green fluorescence ( before photoconversion ) were considered ‘‘winners’’ of a given round of screening . In the final round of optimization , the winners of all previous rounds were genetically shuffled [ 37 ] . Screening of this final library led to the discovery of mMaple , a variant that retains many of the key traits of mClavGR2 ( Fig . 1 ; Table 1 ) , yet provides an improved ratio of red - to - green photoconversion . mMaple is equivalent to mClavGR2 with the HSGLP to RNSTD replacement and A145V / G171S / G225S . In vitro characterization revealed that the primary difference between mMaple and the earlier mClavGR2 variant is a shift in the ground state equilibrium of the green state chromophore from the phenolate form ( absorbance l max = 489 nm ) towards the phenol form ( absorbance l max = 380 nm ) ( Fig . 2A ) . This shift is attributed to an increase in the apparent p K a of the green state chromophore from 8 . 0 to 8 . 2 ( Table 1 ; Fig . S2 ) . The increased ratio of phenol to phenolate form in the green state explains the improved photoconversion contrast of mMaple ( Fig . 2 ) , since it is the phenol form that undergoes the green - to - red photoconversion and it is the phenolate form that is green fluorescent . The post - conversion red state retains the same p K a as mClavGR2 ( 7 . 3 ) , so the population of the red fluorescent phenolate form remains unchanged ( Table 1 ) . We speculate that the A145V mutation is primarily responsible for the shift of the green state p K a , since position 145 is located immediately adjacent to the tyrosine - derived phenolate moiety of the chromophore . Although it does not directly interact with the chromophore , the bulkier side chain of valine may stabilize the protonated state by decreasing the solvent accessibility of the chromophore . Notably , position 145 is occupied by proline in all other pcFPs except Kaede [ 27 ] , which has alanine at this position . The effect of the additional mutations ( G171S , G225S ) is unclear , as they are relatively remote from the chromophore . In vivo Performance of mMaple in ( f - ) PALM / STORM Imaging The basis of ( f - ) PALM / STORM imaging is the conversion of a fluorophore between two spectrally distinct states . We hoped that mMaple’s more highly populated photoconvertible green state would increase the number of observed proteins in ( f - ) PALM / STORM images , when compared to other pcFPs . We used the well - characterized E . coli chemotaxis network as a model system , due to its controllable expression levels and a sensitive function - ality assay [ 9 ] . We prepared plasmids encoding fusions to the E . coli chemotaxis protein CheW under control of an L - arabinose inducible promoter . When expressed in a cheW knockout strain , each pcFP - CheW fusion recovers the strain’s chemotaxis ability to approximately 65 % that of wildtype swarming ( Fig . S3A – B ) . To quantify the number of proteins observed for each construct , we imaged fixed D cheW E . coli expressing CheW fusions to mMaple , mClavGR2 , or mEos2 at optimal induction levels using a custom built ( f - ) PALM / STORM microscope [ 38 ] . In all 3 cases , ( f - ) PALM / STORM images revealed that the subcellular CheW distribution could be constructed from localizing hundreds of single proteins per cell ( Fig . 3A – C ) . After photoconversion , the mean number of photons detected in the red state for each construct were similar , allowing for similar localization precision for all constructs [ 39 ] ( Fig . 3D ; Fig . S4 ) . The largest difference among the pcFPs was that mMaple constructs reliably yielded more protein localizations than mEos2 or mClavGR2 per cell ( 3 . 4 6 and 2 . 3 6 , respectively ) under identical growth and imaging conditions . At native expression levels , each cell should contain approximately 6000 CheW proteins [ 40 ] . However , since the depth of field of the objective restricts the observable region to the lower , 40 % of the cell , approximately 2400 CheW proteins should be imaged . On average , per - cell , we observed 927 6 547 mMaple - CheW localizations ( N = 45 cells ) , 396 6 181 mClavGR2 - CheW localizations ( N = 48 cells ) , and 269 6 113 mEos2 - CheW localizations ( N = 38 cells ) ( Fig . 3E ) . The number of observable mMaple - CheW localizations is closer to the expected native levels of CheW expression than either mClavGR2 or mEos2 . To ensure that the higher number of localizations is not fusion specific , we imaged each pcFP inside fixed wildtype E . coli with no binding partner ( Fig . 4A – B ; left panels ) . In this case , we obtain approximately 10 6 the number of localizations per cell for mMaple expressing cells ( 3497 6 1641 localizations ) relative to mEos2 expressing cells ( 209 6 86 localizations ) . It is important to note that measuring absolute numbers of proteins with ( f - ) PALM / STORM imaging is highly challenging . Factors such as non - fluorescent misfolded proteins , as well as on - off fluorescence switching events , in which fewer than 150 photons are emitted ( below the reconstruction algorithm’s detection threshold ) , result in a fraction of fluorophores which are not mMaple : A New Photoconvertible Fluorescent Protein PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e51314 counted , thus affecting the total number of localizations observed . Additionally , due to the relatively high p K a of mMaple , at any one time a fraction of the photoconverted proteins will be in the protonated state and thus not observable in the red fluorescent channel . We expect that the interconversion of the protonated and non - protonated states is fast relative to our exposure times . This will cause each single fluorescent protein to spend part of the time in the red fluorescent state during each exposure . However , it is possible that these factors may lead to underestimations of the true numbers of fluorescent proteins in a sample . In vivo Performance of mMaple in SIM Imaging In addition to proving that mMaple was suitable for ( f - ) PALM / STORM , our initial experiments also revealed that the mMaple - CheW construct had an exceptional green state brightness relative to both mEos2 and EGFP in vivo . Additionally , mMaple - CheW maintained the correct localization pattern at high concentrations ( Fig . 5A ) , suggesting that protein mislocalization and inclusion body formation due to aggregation or misfolding was not limiting the potential utility of this protein . To further investigate the possibility of misfolding or inclusion body formation of pcFP - CheW fusions , we performed polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) under non - denaturing conditions . We found that although the total amount of soluble protein was similar for all pcFP - CheW fusions investigated ( Fig . S3C ) , a larger fraction of the mMaple protein had reached the fully mature green state than either EGFP or mEos2 ( Fig . 5B ) . The high in vivo green - state brightness of mMaple - CheW ( Fig . 5C – D ) motivated us to attempt 3 - dimensional SIM reconstructions of live E . coli expressing either mMaple - CheW or EGFP - CheW ( Fig . 6 ; Movies S1 , S2 ) . For the first time in our laboratories , we were able to acquire feature - rich SIM images with a pcFP . To produce SIM images of similar quality with EGFP , we needed to express the EGFP - CheW construct at 100 6 higher induction levels , which is consistent with the optimal induction levels for swarming for both constructs ( Fig . S3A - B ) . This difference in necessary induction levels strongly suggests that mMaple is less disruptive than EGFP with respect to the folding and function of a genetically fused CheW partner .

S5 , S6 ; Table S1 ) , even though the initial green fluorescence intensities were similar to those of mMaple and EGFP ( Fig . 5D ) . Origins of mMaple’s Superior Performance in both ( f - ) PALM / STORM and SIM The experiments discussed above demonstrate that mMaple is a useful ‘‘multimodal’’ FP , but questions remained as to why mMaple protein fusions yielded higher numbers of localizations than other FPs in ( f - ) PALM / STORM images . One possible explanation would be that mMaple has a higher propensity for reversible photoswitching , which would increase the number of observed localizations per cell . For instance , the red fluorescent state of mEos2 can undergo multiple cycles of reversible photoswitching into a long - lived dark state [ 41 ] . This effect is important to consider for accurate protein counting measurements using ( f - ) PALM / STORM images [ 9 , 41 , 42 ] . In - deed , we found that mMaple and mClavGR2 also exhibit reversible photoswitching of the red state ( Fig . S7 ) . To quantify the extent of reversible photoswitching , we used a previously described clustering algorithm [ 9 ] to group closely spaced protein localizations ( , 30 nm interlocalization spacing , Fig . 4A – B ; right panels ) , and classified these groups as resulting from reversible switching of a single protein . Analysis of the ( f - ) PALM / STORM images of E . coli with cytoplasmically expressed pcFPs revealed that 56 % of mMaple , and over 80 % of both mClavGR2 and mEos2 localizations did not have a second localization within 30 nm ( Fig . 4D ; Fig . S8 ) . To further quantify possible reversible switching events , we imaged single mMaple and mEos2 proteins immobilized on a glass coverslip using ( f - ) PALM / STORM ( Fig . S9A – B ) . During image analysis , we once again grouped closely spaced localizations into clusters and obtained cluster size distributions for mMaple , mEos2 , and the negative control for which no fluorescent proteins were present ( Fig . S9C ) . The background subtracted cluster size distributions for each pcFP revealed that approximately 35 % of mMaple localizations and 65 % of mEos2 localizations were observed as single localizations ( Fig . S9D ) . Therefore we conclude that , under our imaging conditions , the red fluorescent state of mMaple has a two - fold higher propensity to reversibly photoswitch than mEos2 . Does this two - fold increased reversible photoswitching com - pletely account for the differences in the number of localizations observed in E . coli containing different cytoplasmically expressed pcFPs ? We reassessed the ( f - ) PALM / STORM images of cytoplas - mic pcFPs by counting both isolated localizations and clusters of localizations ( , 30 nm interlocalization spacing ) as single proteins . Using this counting procedure we obtained an average number of proteins per cell for mMaple ( 765 6 283 ) that is approximately 7 6 higher than for mEos2 ( 109 6 55 ) ( Fig . 4E ) , suggesting that the higher number of fluorophore localizations seen for mMaple constructs in E . coli is not simply due to reversible photoswitching . We next investigated whether differences in photoconversion probability could explain the increased number of localizations observed for mMaple in ( f - ) PALM / STORM . The two factors that contribute to the photoconversion probability are the extinction coefficient at 405 nm and the quantum yield for photoconversion . The extinction coefficient of mMaple at 405 nm is 10 , 300 M 2 1 cm 2 1 , whereas mEos2 is 4 , 400 M 2 1 cm 2 1 . Howev - er , this 2 . 3 6 higher absorbance for mMaple is counterbalanced by a 5 . 5 6 lower quantum yield of photoconversion . Taking both factors into account , mEos2 has a 2 . 4 6 higher probability of photoconverting under identical illumination conditions . Accord - ingly , we conclude that the increased number of localizations obtained with mMaple is not due to differences in photoconver - sion probability . A final possible contributor to the increased number of mMaple - CheW localizations observed in ( f - ) PALM / STORM Figure 2 . Characterization of mClavGR2 and its improved variants .

We investigated this possibility in vitro , such that quantitative comparisons could be made . SDS - PAGE of the soluble and insoluble lysate fractions for E . coli expressing each pcFP revealed a substantial improvement in folding efficiency of mMaple ( 100 % of mMaple was found in the soluble fraction compared to 29 % for mEos2 ) ( Fig . S10 ) . An increased concentration of properly folded mMaple - CheW in vivo most likely accounts for both the increased number of localizations and the relatively low induction levels needed to provide strong green - state fluorescence signal ( Fig . 5A ) . Does the increased folding efficiency of mMaple fully explain its performance in SIM imaging ? Obtaining 3D - SIM reconstructions typically requires a large number of images of a sample , therefore it is important to use bright and photostable fluorophores to increase image quality . The high in vivo concentration of mMaple provides a partial explanation for the experimentally observed in vivo green - state brightness , but it does not explain the apparent lack of appreciable fading during prolonged SIM image acquisi - tion . Quantifying resistance to photobleaching in living cells under widefield illumination , revealed that mMaple’s green state was 14 - fold more photostable than mEos2’s green state , as judged by time to 50 % loss of signal ( 65 . 1 sec for mMaple and 4 . 6 sec for mEos2 ) ( Fig . S5 ) . Therefore , we attribute the high quality of the E . coli SIM images to mMaple’s higher in vivo green state photostability . The advantages and limitations of mMaple relative to mEos2 , for these specific applications and uses , are summarized in Table 2 . mMaple’s Performance in Mammalian Cells To determine mMaple’s performance in mammalian cells , we performed fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry analysis of HeLa cells transfected with plasmids encoding pcFP - actin and pcFP - actinin fusion proteins ( Fig . 7 ) . Visual examination of transfected cells revealed similar overall brightness and localization patterns for mMaple and mEos2 . However , when the brightness of a large population of cells was assessed by flow cytometry , it was apparent that mMaple - actin or mMaple - actinin was not brighter than either of the corresponding mEos2 or mClavGR2 fusions when expressed in mammalian cells . For the actinin fusion , mClavGR2 had the greatest fraction of bright cells , followed by mMaple and mEos2 . For the actin fusion , mClavGR2 and mEos2 had similar distributions that were shifted towards higher brightness relative to mMaple . Further examination of the actin constructs showed that though the overall brightness of the mMaple - actin constructs was not increased relative to the other Figure 3 .

Although these results were disappointing , we noted that the photostability of mMaple - actin is improved by almost three - fold ( 10 . 0 sec for mMaple in comparison to 3 . 6 sec as judged by confocal imaging ) , increasing the utility of the mMaple - actin construct in applications requiring green - state photostability ( Fig . S11 ) . Due to the large cell - to - cell heterogeneity in expression levels following transient transfection of mammalian cells , we did not attempt to compare numbers of localizations by PALM imaging . These results indicate that the exceptional folding efficiency of mMaple for prokaryotic imaging does not simply translate to mammalian cells . Perhaps , this limitation reflects the extensive directed evolution in bacterial cells used to generate mMaple . The brightness of mMaple and other pcFPs in mammalian cells is clearly fusion - and context specific and likely depends on a number of as - yet poorly understood factors . However , it is clear that the Figure 4 . ( f - ) PALM / STORM characterization of the number of observed localizations and proteins per cell .

Conclusions We have engineered a photoconvertible protein with a fortuitous combination of properties that enables this FP to be used in both ( f - ) PALM / STORM and SIM . The major advantages of mMaple over mEos2 are more efficient protein folding and a significantly increased photostability of the green state . We expect that this new variant will be of utility as it allows the dynamics of protein complexes to be characterized in vivo with increased spatial resolution and good temporal resolution ( e . g . , by SIM or conventional imaging ) , and also allows the precise localization of the same fusion proteins to be determined with ( f - ) PALM / STORM . It remains to be determined if these advantages will translate to other types of prokaryotic cells , and / or different mammalian cell fusions . We hope that the advent of mMaple will spur efforts to engineer a new generation of FPs that exploit the advantages of various imaging modalities .

The sequences of all primers used in this work are provided at the end of the Methods and Materials section . Plasmid and linear DNA purifications were performed using QIAprep spin miniprep or QIA gel extraction kits ( Qiagen ) . All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs . PCR amplifications were carried out using the PfuUltraII Fusion HS polymerase ( Stragene ) of Pfu polymerase ( Fermentas ) . Sequencing reactions were performed using the BigDye Terminator v3 . 1 Cycle Sequencing Kit ( Applied Biosystems ) or with custom sequencing primers and analyzed at either the University of Alberta Molecular Biology Service Unit or UC Berkeley DNA Sequencing Facility . Mass spectrometry ( MS ) was performed by the MS Facility in the Department of Chemistry , University of Alberta . Engineering of Improved mClavGR Variants A two - step PCR procedure was used to introduce the 220 – 224 HSGLP to RNSTD modification into mClavGR2 . In the first step , the gene encoding mClavGR2 [ 31 ] was PCR amplified with the reverse primer1 and forward primer2 . The resulting PCR product was used as the template for a second PCR amplification with forward primer2 and reverse primer3 , which yielded the full length FP gene . As with all gene libraries for screening and single genes for large scale expression , purification , and in vitro charac - terization , the full length gene was digested by Xho1 and EcoR1 and ligated with T4 ligase ( Invitrogen ) into similarly digested pBAD / His B vector . To create a gene library with all possible residues at position 173 , the template gene was subjected to two separate PCR amplifications : one with forward primer4 and reverse primer3 and one with forward primer2 and reverse primer5 . The PCR products were combined and the full length gene assembled by overlap extension [ 43 ] . Creation of randomly mutated and gene shuffled libraries was carried out as previous described [ 31 ] .

For library screening , plates were incubated for 14 h at 37 u C prior to inspection . The screening setup and general protocol was been previously described [ 31 ] . Briefly , Petri dishes harboring colonies of E . coli transformed with a gene library were imaged to record their initial green fluorescence intensity . The plate was then subjected to illumination from a dense array of 405 nm LEDs . The red fluorescence intensity of the same dish was recorded after photoconversion . Digital fluorescence images were then processed to acquire both the green and red fluorescence intensity of each colony . In an effort to more effectively identify variants that exhibited rapid photoconversion , the illumination ( i . e . , photo - conversion ) time of the colony libraries was decreased from 20 min to 10 min . Colonies that exhibit both high brightness and an improved ratio of red fluorescence after photoconversion to green fluorescence before photoconversion are considered ‘‘winners’’ of a given round of screening and served as templates for the following round of library generation . In vitro Characterization of mMaple Protein purification was carried out as previously reported [ 36 ] . The protein was exchanged into PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) buffer unless otherwise indicated . Molar extinction coefficients ( e ) of the green states were measured by the alkali denaturation method and then used as reference to measure e for the red states [ 44 , 45 ] . To determine the e of the red states , the pcFPs were photoconverted using 405 nm LED array until the red absorbance peak reached a maximum . Fluorescence quantum yields ( W ) were determined using fluorescein in 10 mM NaOH ( W = 0 . 95 ) [ 46 ] and Rhoda - mine 6G in ethanol ( W = 0 . 94 ) [ 47 ] as standards . The quantum yield of photoconversion ( W PC ) was determined using W PC = [ red ] 1 min / Int [ I ( x ) 6 ( 1 – 10 2 abs ( x ) ) dx ] , where [ red ] 1 min is the concentration of red species after 1 min of photoconversion with the 405 nm LED , abs ( x ) and I ( x ) are the sample absorbance and illuminating light intensity at wavelength x , respectively , and the integral runs from 390 to 420 nm . The emission profile of the 405 nm LED used for photoconversion is defined as I ( x ) = I 0 exp ( - ( x - 405 ) 2 / 36 ) based on the emission maximum and the full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) provided in the product catalogue . All absorption measurement was acquired on a DU - 800 UV - visible spectrophotometer ( Beckman ) . All fluorescence spectra were recorded on a QuantaMaster spectrofluorimeter ( Photon Tech - nology International ) and have been corrected for the detector response . For determination of the pH dependence , purified protein in PBS was diluted 1 : 50 into a series of pH - adjusted citrate saline ( pH # 8 ) or sodium phosphate ( pH . 8 ) buffers in a 96 - well black clear bottom plate ( Corning ) . Fluorescence was measured using a Safire2 plate reader ( Tecan ) . The oligomeric structures of mClavGR2 and mMaple were determined by size - exclusion chromatography with a HiLoad 16 / 60 Superdex 75 pg gel - filtration column on a AKTA Prime Plus system ( GE Health ) . To measure the maturation profiles of mMaple , mClavGR2 and mEos2 , E . coli transformed with pBAD / His B plasmids bearing the encoding cDNA was cultured overnight . The culture was diluted to an OD 600 of 0 . 6 , purged with argon for 20 min , sealed with a rubber septum , and incubated for another 1 h to allow thorough consumption of the residue oxygen . L - Arabinose ( 0 . 025 % ) was then added via a syringe with needle to induce expression of the FPs . After 4 h of incubation with shaking at 37 u C , the cultures were transferred to an ice bath for 10 min and maintained at 4 u C . Cells were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 2 min , and cell pellets were lysed using vacuum - degassed B - PER II ( Pierce ) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min . The lysate was then centrifuged at 12 , 500 rpm for 5 min , and the superna - tant was diluted 10 6 into PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Fluorescence maturation was monitored at 37 u C using a Safire2 plate reader ( Tecan ) . Figure 7 . pcFP fusions expressed in mammalian cells .

The culture was diluted to an OD 600 of 0 . 6 in a total volume of 4 mL and L - arabinose ( final concentration 0 . 02 % ) was added to induce the expression of the FPs . After 2 h growing at 37 u C with shaking , the cells were collected , lysed with 50 m L of B - PER ( Pierce ) , and centrifuged to separate the soluble proteins from insoluble material . An aliquot of the supernatant was taken for later SDS - PAGE analysis . The cell pellet was rinsed once with B - PER and once with 2 M urea . The pellet was then redissolved in 100 m L 8 M urea and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min . An aliquot of the supernatant was taken for later SDS - PAGE analysis . Both the supernatant from the lysate and the supernatant from the pellet extract were further purified by Ni 2 + - NTA - conjugated beads and all samples were analyzed by SDS - PAGE . The intensity of the bands was analyzed using ImageQuant RT ECL ( General Electric ) . Evaluation of the expression level of FP - CheW fusions was performed similarly except that ( 1 ) the E . coli strains used are RP437derivatives grown under the same culture conditions used for imaging ( see below ) and ( 2 ) 40 m g of each whole cell lysate was loaded onto the gel . Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA kit ( Thermo Scientific ) . Fluorescent image of the gel were acquired using a custom built imaging system equipped with a 300 W Xeon lamp , a 450 – 490 nm filter for excitation and a 500 – 550 nm filter for emission . Fluorescent intensity was analyzed using Image Pro Plus ( Media Cybernetics ) . Bacterial Strains and Plasmids for E . coli Imaging Strains containing CheW fusions are derivatives of RP437 , a chemotactic wild - type E . coli K - 12 strain . CheW fusions were expressed in a strain lacking the genomic copy of CheW . All other strains are derivatives of MG1655 , a wild - type E . coli K - 12 strain . Strains derived from MG1655 contain the pJat plasmid [ 48 ] , which contains the L - arabinose transporter gene ( araE ) under a constitutive promoter to increase the homogenous expression from the L - arabinose promoter . pJat is gentamicin resistant . All proteins were expressed from the inducible L - arabinose promoter on the low - copy plasmid pBAD ( Invitrogen ) containing a pBR322 - derived origin , the ampicillin resistance gene ( bla ) , and the a raC gene for positive regulation of the L - arabinose promoter . pALM1000 contains the EGFP gene only , pALM7000 contains the mEos2 gene only , pALM9000 contains the mClavGR2 gene only , and pALM10000 contains the mMaple gene only . RP437 D cheW was made by P1 transduction from the Keio collection strains JW1876 ( D cheW : : kan ) . The deletion in this strain was constructed to minimize polar effects on downstream gene expression by retaining the native start codon and the last 18 C - terminal nucleotides [ 49 ] . Construction of Plasmids for Expression of CheW Fusion Constructs All fusions to CheW consist of the FP followed by the entire cheW gene ( residues 1 – 167 ) , and a terminal Glu - Phe encoding an EcoRI site . Plasmid pALM7000 was constructed by PCR amplification of the monomeric Eos2 gene from the plasmid pRSETa _ mEos2 ( Addgene plasmid 20341 ) using primer6 and primer7 , which contain NcoI and BamHI sites , respectively . The PCR product was inserted into plasmid pBAD ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The N - terminal plasmid leader sequence was removed by digestion with NcoI and religation . pALM9000 was constructed by PCR amplification of the monomeric ClavGR2 gene from the plasmid pmClavGR2 - C1 using primer8 and primer9 containing NcoI and PstI sites , respectively . The PCR product was subcloned into pALM7000 using the NcoI and PstI sites . pALM10000 was constructed by PCR amplification of the monomeric Maple ( pALM10000 ) gene from the pBAD / HisB plasmid containing mMaple using primer10 and primer11 . This PCR product was subcloned into pALM7000 using the NcoI and PstI sites . Plasmid pALM1000 was constructed by PCR amplification of EGFP from the pTrcHis2 - EGFP plasmid using primer12 and primer13 . This PCR product was subcloned into pALM7000 using the NcoI and PstI sites . Fusions of pcFPs with CheW were constructed by PCR amplification of cheW from strain RP437 using primer14 and primer15 , and cloned into the PstI and EcoRI sites of pALM1000 , pALM7000 , pALM9000 , pALM10000 , immediately after the FP gene to create pALM1001 , pALM7001 , pALM9001 and pALM10001 that contain EGFP - cheW , mEos2 - cheW , mClavGR2 - cheW , and mMaple - cheW gene fusions respectively . Construction of Plasmids for Expression in Mammalian Cells To create the pcFP - actin constructs , we amplified the gene encoding pcFP with a 5 9 primer with an NheI site and a 3 9 primer with an XhoI site . The purified PCR products were then digested and ligated into pEGFP - actin ( Clontech ) , whose FP - coding gene has been previously removed by the same restriction enzymes . pcFP - actinin constructs were generated in a similar way using a 5 9 primer encoding an AgeI site , a 3 9 primer encoding a BspEI , and the pactinin - EGFP vector ( Clontech ) . Plasmid DNA for transfec - tion was prepared using the GeneJET TM Plasmid Miniprep Kit ( Fermentas ) or using the Plasmid Maxi kit ( QIAGEN , Valencia , CA ) . Preparation of Mammalian Cells for Imaging and Flow Cytometry HeLa cells ( CCL2 line ; ATCC ) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Sigma ) , 2 mM GlutaMax ( Invitrogen ) and penicillin - streptomycin . Transfection was carried using TurboFect TM ( Fermentas ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Imaging or cytometry experiment was conducted 36 , 48 h after transfection . The growing medium was changed into HEPES ( 25 mM ) buffered Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution ( HHBSS ) for imaging . Imaging was carried on an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope equipped with a 150 W Lumen 200 metal halide lamp ( Prior Scientific ) , a 60 6 oil immersion objective ( Nikon ) , and a 16 - bit 512SC QuantEM CCD ( Photometrics ) . For cytometry experiment , cells were trypsinized , collected by centrifugation , resuspended in HHBSS and analyzed on a C6 Flow Cytometer ( Accuri ) . About 7000 to 20000 events were recorded , depending on the transfection efficiency , but only the first 7000 events were plot in Fig . 4 . At least two replicas were conducted for each constructs . Brightness corrected for excitation and emission was calculated via F corr = F app / relative bright - ness = F app / ( EC 488 6 a ) , where F app is the average of the acquired median fluorescence intensity , EC 488 is the FP’s extinction coefficient at 488 nm , and a is the fraction of the emission spectrum passing the given filter ( 515 – 545 nm ) . Preparation for in Depth Comparison of pcFP - actin Fusions in Mammalian Cells Human carcinoma U2OS cells ( HTB - 96 line ; ATCC ) were plated on glass coverslips , and incubated overnight prior to transfection with either actin - mMaple , actin - mClavGR2 or actin - mEos2 . Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine H 2000 mMaple : A New Photoconvertible Fluorescent Protein PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 10 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e51314 Reagent . After 12 hours of expression live cells were imaged at a wavelength of 491 nm on the spinning - disk confocal microscope with CoolSNAP HQ2 CCD camera in the stream acquisition mode of MetaMorph software . To measure photobleaching , the normalized fluorescence intensity was logged over time with a temporal resolution of about 300 ms , and the half - life period t K of the fluorophores was calculated using one phase decay equation . To test for statistical significant distributions of photobleaching times , we utilized the Mann - Whitney t - test . Differences between data points were considered significant at P # 0 . 0001 . Determination of Photoconversion Rate and Photoconversion Contrast HeLa S3 cells ( CCL2 line ; ATCC ) were cultured in a 50 : 50 mixture of Ham’s F - 12 and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 12 . 5 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) . The cells were then seeded onto 35 mm Delta - T imaging dishes for live cell imaging under an atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 . Cells were transfected in culture medium with Effectene ( Qiagen ) and 1 m g of purified plasmid DNA encoding the pcFP fused with human histone H2B . At 24 hours post - transfection , samples received fresh media and were imaged live . All photoconversion contrast measurements were performed on an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope with an Olympus PLAPO 60 6 oil - immersion objective ( NA = 1 . 4 ) . FluoView software ( Olympus ) was used for microscope control and image acquisition , and Simple PCI software ( Hamamatsu ) was used for image analysis . The 488 nm argon and 543 nm helium - neon laser lines ( Melles Griot ) were used with a 405 / 488 / 543 dichroic mirror to excite the green and red forms of each protein . Emission was collected in two channels spanning 500 – 533 nm ( 488 nm laser ) and 550 – 660 nm ( 543 nm laser ) . For photoconversion , a 405 nm diode laser line ( Olympus Simultaneous scanner unit ) was used with the same dichroic for stimulation . Cells were imaged at a scan speed of 4 . 0 m s / pixel and were stimulated with the Simultaneous Scanner at a speed of 2 . 0 m s / pixel . Each experiment was performed with a pinhole size of 600 m m . A single relatively bright nucleus was selected for imaging and both the red and green fluorescence channels were imaged while the entire nucleus was stimulated using the 405 nm Simultaneous Scanner . The average intensity at each time point for a region - of - interest within the nucleus was determined in software for each of 10 independent experiments and the average value was plotted as a function of time . To assess the rate of photoconversion , the time at which red fluorescence reached half of its maximum value was determined . Photoconversion contrast was calculated as the ratio of red fluorescence intensity ( arbitrary units ) to green fluorescence intensity ( arbitrary units ) immediately after red fluorescence had reached a maximum and near the end of the experimental time course . Determination of Photobleaching Rates Laser - scanning confocal and widefield microscopy photobleach - ing experiments utilized HeLa S3 cells ( CCL2 line ; ATCC ) expressing fusions of pcFP fused with human histone H2B , as described above for the photoconversion experiments . Nuclei with similar size and fluorescence intensity were chosen for photo - bleaching experiments . For laser - scanning confocal photobleach - ing an Olympus FV1000 was used to first image the cells at a low magnification to ensure cell vitality . The microscope was set to a zoom of 8 6 , a photomultiplier voltage of 500 V , and an offset of 12 % , with a scan time of 4 m s / pixel . Cells were photobleached utilizing an Olympus PLAPO 60 6 oil - immersion objective ( NA = 1 . 4 ) using either a 488 nm ( green state ) or a 543 nm ( red state ) laser line that was maintained at an output power of 120 m W using a FieldMax II - TO ( Coherent ) power meter . The fluores - cence signal was collected in two channels spanning 500 – 522 nm ( 488 nm laser ) and 550 – 660 nm ( 543 nm laser ) . A 405 nm diode laser line was used to photoconvert the protein . For widefield photobleaching experiments , transfected HeLa S3 cells ( CCL2 line ; ATCC ) in a Bioptechs Delta - T imaging chamber were imaged on a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope equipped with a 40 6 dry objective ( Nikon Plan Fluorite NA = 0 . 85 ) and an X - Cite exacte light source ( Lumen Dynamics ) . To ensure the same power levels were used for each filter set , a Newport 1918 - C optical power meter was used at the objective to measure the illumination intensity . Power was moderated using neutral density filters contained in the lamp . Regions of the dish containing 10 – 20 nuclei were photobleached for 3000 frames at a 100 ms exposure time with no delay . Images were collected using a QImaging Retiga EXi camera ( Photometrics ) . Photoconversion was conduct - ed using an Omega QMax Blue filter set . Photobleaching was conducted using a Chroma FITC - HYQ cube ( green species ) and a Semrock TRITC - A - 000 cube ( red species ) at a power of 11 . 4 mW / cm 2 . The raw data was collected using NIS - Elements software ( Nikon ) and analyzed with Simple PCI software ( Hamamatsu ) . E . coli Cell Culture Conditions for Imaging Strains derived from RP437 were grown overnight in T - broth ( 1 % w / v Difco Bacto - Tryptone ( Becton Dickinson and Company ) , and 0 . 5 % w / v NaCl ( Fisher - Scientific ) ( pH 7 . 0 ) ) at 30 u C with aeration . Day cultures were inoculated to an optical density at 600 nm ( OD 600 ) of approximately 0 . 01 into T - broth with appropriate antibiotics at 30 u C with aeration until they reached an OD 600 0 . 1 – 0 . 3 . Protein expression was induced by adding 0 . 01 % or 0 . 02 % L - arabinose for 3 hrs , as indicated . Media and temperature were chosen to obtain the highest expression levels of properly folded proteins [ 28 , 30 , 31 , 50 ] . Swarm Plate Assay To assess the functionality of chemotaxis fusion proteins , 2 m l of stationary - phase cells were spotted on soft - agar swarm plates and incubated at 30 u C for 5 h . Wild - type RP437 E . coli cells were compared with a CheW deletion strain and CheW deletion strains with fluorescently tagged CheW fusion proteins ( cells used for imaging ) . All complemented strains contain plasmids derived from pBAD ( pBAD TOPO - TA Invitrogen ) , which confers ampicillin resistance and is L - arabinose inducible . Swarm plates contain 0 . 3 % agar ( Becton - Dickinson ) in T - broth supplemented with varying concentrations of L - arabinose . Cells were grown in tryptone broth with appropriate antibiotics at 30 u C prior to spotting on swarm plates . Sample Preparation and Imaging Protocol for SIM Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2 , 000 g for 15 minutes . The outer membrane of the E . coli was fluorescently labeled with 10 ng / m L FM4 - 64 ( Invitrogen ) diluted in M9 ( 1 . 05 % M9 salts ( Amresco ) supplemented with 2 mM MgSO 4 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 and 0 . 4 % glycerol ) for 5 minutes . Cells were washed twice with M9 media and resuspended in fresh M9 media . 20 uL of 1 . 5 % low - melt agar ( Apex ) dissolved in M9 media was deposited on a 25 mm 6 75 mm single shallow depression slide ( Boreal Northwest ) flanked by two pieces of double stick tape and allowed to air dry . 0 . 5 m L of cells labeled with FM4 - 64 were deposited on the top of the agar and sandwiched between a 22 mm 2 # 1 . 5 microscope coverslip ( Fisherbrand ) . mMaple : A New Photoconvertible Fluorescent Protein PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 11 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e51314 SIM imaging was performed on the Deltavision | OMX V3 . 0 ( Applied Precision Inc , Issaquah , WA ) containing 405 nm , 488 nm , 514 nm , 593 nm and 642 nm laser lines [ 51 ] . The sample was imaged with a 100 6 1 . 40 NA oil objective with 1 . 514 or 1 . 516 index immersion oil . Eukaryotic cells were imaged with 488 nm excitation and E . coli cells were imaged with 488 nm and 594 nm excitation . The fluorescence emission was split by channel , filtered and imaged using a dedicated custom mono - chrome 20 MHz camera with Sony ICX285 ER progressive scan CCD using 5 – 60 ms exposures . Acquisition was controlled by the OMXN controller software ( Applied Precision Inc , Issaquah , WA ) while reconstructions were made with the OMX specific Soft - WoRx v4 . 5 . 0 software package ( Applied Precision Inc . , Issaquah , WA ) . 3D reconstructions were obtained in 125 nm steps . Sample Preparation and Imaging Protocol for ( f - ) PALM / STORM Cells were fixed harvested by centrifugation at 2 , 000 g for 15 minutes . Cells were resuspended in 2 – 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) with 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 % gluteraldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) in PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) for 10 minutes . Cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in fresh PBS . # 1 . 5 Lab - TekII 8 - well chambers ( Nalge Nunc International ) were covered with 200 m L 0 . 1 % w / v poly - L - lysine for 15 min then rinsed with water . Cells were added and spun onto coverslips at 2 , 000 g for 10 min . The sample were then rinsed with PBS and left in fresh PBS for imaging . ( f - ) PALM / STORM imaging was performed according to Greenfield et al . [ 9 ] on an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope equipped with a 100 6 , 1 . 40 NA objective ( Olympus ) [ 38 ] . 405 nm and 561 nm laser light was delivered to the microscope through free space . 488 nm light was delivered via a mercury lamp with appropriate excitation and emission filters . Single - molecule fluorescence signals generated during acquisition were separated from the activation and excitation light using appropriate filter sets [ 10 , 52 ] within the microscope and passed to an electron - multiplying charge - coupled device ( CCD ) camera running at approximately 20 Hz ( 50 ms exposures ) . Movie acquisition times were dependent on the regions of highest labeled - protein density . Activation intensity was increased slowly such that a given diffraction - limited spot contained no activated proteins . 90 % of the time . This is necessary to ensure that only one protein is activated at a time in a single diffraction - limited spot . Image generation and data analysis were done using custom Matlab scripts ( Mathworks ) , as described by Greenfield et al . [ 9 ] , and custom IDL software [ 10 ] . The localization and image - rendering algorithms used in this work have been previously described [ 3 , 4 ] . Briefly , images were filtered and proteins were identified as signals that contained counts larger than four standard deviations above background . Proteins that became dark , but reappeared within five frames , were counted as the same protein . Photon distributions were obtained from proteins emitting at least 300 photons . In the case of the E . coli ( f - ) PALM / STORM images , only proteins that emitted at least 150 photons were counted , for mammalian cell ( f - ) PALM / STORM images , only proteins that emitted 400 photons or more were included . Sample drift was corrected by previously described algorithms [ 3 , 6 , 10 ] . Single protein localizations were grouped into clusters using a tree - clustering algorithm [ 9 ] . Proteins spaced less than 30 nm apart from each other are considered to be part of the same cluster , where clusters contain 2 or more proteins . 30 nm interlocalization spacing was chosen because it is twice the mean localization precision for these pcFPs [ 9 , 39 ] . Sample Preparation and Imaging Protocol for ( f - ) PALM / STORM with Purified Protein mMaple and mEos2 were purified as described above and then biotinylated using EZ - Link Sulfo - NHS - Biotin ( Pierce ) following the manufacturer’s instruction . This biotinylation kit would provide a spacer about 22 . 4 A˚ between the pcFP and the biotin module . The spectral profile of absorbance , excitation and emission of the pcFPs were measured and found to remain unchanged . The number of labeled biotins per pcFP molecule was determined to be a distribution that ranged from 7 – 13 , based on MALDI - MS . Single biotinylated pcFPs were immobilized on an glass coverslip by incubating the slide with 1 . 0 mg / mL biotinylated bovine serum albumin ( b - BSA , Sigma ) solution for 30 sec , followed by 0 . 25 mg / mL streptavidin ( Invitrogen ) and then biotinylated pcFPs at approximately 0 . 6 m M in PBS , which were sonicated prior to addition . To correct for drift , 200 nm yellow - green beads ( Molecular Probes ) diluted in PBS were added to the chamber and immobilized using a buffer containing 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM NaCl and 50 mM MgCl 2 . The slide was rinsed with PBS prior to the addition of each reagent . Single pcFPs were imaged in PBS using continuous activation and excitation using 405 nm and 561 lasers for 10 , 000 frames at constant laser power . To determine the degree of false positive events observed during imaging , a sample chamber containing only PBS and fiduciary markers was imaged . ( f - ) PALM / STORM images were reconstructed and drift corrected as described above . To determine the degree of reversible photoswitching , closely spaced molecules were grouped , resulting in a cluster size distribution for each pcFP as well as the negative control . The distribution obtained from the negative control was subtracted from the resulting pcFP distributions to remove the population of false positives resulting from events unrelated to pcFP fluores - cence .

Supporting Information Figure S1 Gel filtration chromatography of mMaple and mClavGR2 . Both mClavGR2 ( injection concentration of 0 . 5 mM ) and mMaple ( injection concentration of 0 . 5 mM ) mMaple : A New Photoconvertible Fluorescent Protein PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 12 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e51314 purified from E . coli by Ni 2 + - NTA affinity chromatography show an additional peak at 63 min . This peak is diminished in size for mMaple relative to mClavGR2 ( 6 . 7 % vs . 25 . 8 % of monomer peak area ) . While this peak does elute at a time consistent with the dimer species , it was not observed following reinjection of the collected and concentrated monomeric peak of either mClavGR2 ( injection concentration of 0 . 34 mM ) or mMaple ( injection concentration of 0 . 39 mM ) . The fact that the species eluting at 63 min was not observed in the reinjection suggests that it is not the typical non - covalent dimer species expected for weakly dimerizing fluorescent proteins . While the nature of this species remains unclear , it is apparent that the tendency of it to form is reduced in mMaple . ( TIF ) Figure S2 pH titrations of pcFP variants . For each variant the fluorescent intensity at pH values ranging from 5 to 10 was determined by diluting purified protein into concentrated buffer adjusted to the appropriate pH . For the green state ( green line , diamond symbols ) , the l ex = 440 nm and the l em = 530 nm . For the red state ( red line , triangle symbols ) , the l ex = 540 nm and the l em = 630 nm . ( A ) mMaple . ( B ) mClavGR2 . ( TIF ) Figure S3 Swarm plate assays to assess the function of CheW fusions . Approximately 2 m l of D cheW E . coli transformed with a plasmid encoding a FP - CheW fusion were placed on T - broth soft agar swarm plates . The ability for the E . coli to undergo chemotaxis was assessed by measuring the diameter of the swarm ring 5 h after the bacteria were placed on the agar at 30 u C . The D cheW strain has no apparent swarm ring and strain RP437 exhibits the wild - type swarm ring . Interestingly , fusions with all of the pcFPs used in this work are able to rescue the swarming phenotype more effectively than the analogous GFP fusion . ( A ) Swarming ability as a percentage of wild - type for bacteria expressing mMaple , mClavGR2 , mEos2 , or GFP fused to CheW . Excessively high concentrations of CheW can disrupt swarming ability , and thus the size of swarm rings will decrease at high inducer concentration [ 54 ] . Error bars are standard error , N = 3 measurements . ( B ) Image of a representative agar plate ( 0 . 01 % L - arabinose concentration ) showing swarm rings for each of the constructs mentioned above . ( C ) Coomassie stained SDS - PAGE gel of the soluble and insoluble fractions of E . coli expressing pcFP - CheWs ( row denoted by red arrow ) described in this work . First and last lanes are the protein ladder . Relative intensity of the bands is : 132 , 120 and 27 for EGFP - CheW ; 82 , 52 and 0 for mEos2 - CheW ; 100 , 164 and 0 for mMaple - CheW ; 154 and 0 for mClavGR2 ; Samples were not denatured prior to loading . ( TIF ) Figure S4 Number of photons emitted by pcFPs fused to CheW . Representative distributions of the number of photons emitted in the red fluorescent state by CheW fusions to ( A ) mMaple ( B ) mClavGR2 and ( C ) mEos2 .

Photobleaching curves of the green state ( left panels ) and the red state ( right panels ) of pcFP - H2B fusions expressed in HeLa S3 cells with widefield illumination . Each curve represents the photobleaching behavior of an individual cell and the darker colored curve is the average . Average time when the fluorescence intensity of the green states ( left panels ) decreased to half of the initial intensity are 65 . 1 sec for mMaple ( A ) ( 45 cells ) , 69 . 7 sec for mClavGR2 ( B ) ( 42 cells ) , and 4 . 6 sec for mEos2 ( C ) ( 48 cells ) . The average time for the red state is 180 . 3 sec for mMaple ( A ) ( 36 cells ) , 241 . 2 sec for mClavGR2 ( B ) ( 35 cells ) , and 205 . 8 sec for mEos2 ( C ) ( 49 cells ) . Values have been tabulated in Table S1 . ( TIF ) Figure S6 Confocal imaging photobleaching curves for pcFPs . Photobleaching curves of the green states ( left panels ) and the red states ( right panels ) of pcFP - H2B fusions expressed in HeLa S3 cells with confocal illumination . Each curve represents the photobleaching behavior of an individual cell and the dark colored curve is the average . Average time for the green state fluorescence intensity to decrease to half of the initial intensity are 9 . 4 sec for mMaple ( A ) ( 22 cells ) , 4 . 6 sec for mClavGR2 ( B ) ( 30 cells ) , and 2 . 7 sec for mEos2 ( C ) ( 28 cells ) . The average time for the red state fluorescence intensity to decrease by half is 133 . 2 sec for mMaple ( A ) ( 27 cells ) , 206 . 3 sec for mClavGR2 ( B ) ( 23 cells ) and 55 . 1 sec for mEos2 ( C ) ( 25 cells ) . Values have been tabulated in Table S1 . ( TIF ) Figure S7 Reversible photoswitching of photoconverted ( red ) mMaple . ( A ) Photoconverted mMaple can be further photoconverted to a ‘‘dark’’ non - fluorescent state by illumination with green light . ( B ) The dark state of the photoconverted mMaple reversibly photoswitches back to the red fluorescent state as seen by changes in the absorbance spectra in response to different light sources . The absorbance at 280 nm ( purple line , corresponding to total protein concentration ) , the absorbance at 457 nm ( blue line , corresponding to the dark post - conversion red state ) and the absorbance at 566 nm ( red line , corresponding to the red fluorescent state of the protein ) are plotted . As the protein is exposed to 532 nm light , the protein is switched from the red state to the dark state ( green regions ) , which can be re - excited by 460 nm light ( blue region ) , 405 nm light ( violet region ) and white light ( light grey region ) . No absorbance changes were observed if the protein was kept in the dark ( dark grey region ) . Similar results were obtained for mClavGR2 . ( TIF ) Figure S8 Cluster analysis of pcFP localizations . The percentage of localizations grouped into clusters ( , 30 nm interlocalization spacing ) for cytoplasmically expressed pcFPs .

( TIF ) Figure S10 Expression and maturation of new pcFPs expressed in E . coli . ( A ) Maturation of mClavGR variants and mEos2 at 37 u C . The maturation profiles of mMaple ( green ) and mClavGR2 ( dark red ) can be fit as monoexponential curves with time constants of 39 min and 29 min , respectively . Under the conditions of this experiment , mEos2 ( orange ) is approximately mMaple : A New Photoconvertible Fluorescent Protein PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 13 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e51314 50 % as bright as mMaple and , in agreement with our previous results [ 31 ] , appears to have fully matured prior to the initial measurement . Each curve represents the average of six indepen - dent measurements and error bars represent standard deviations .

For each construct , one lane corresponds to the whole cell lysate ( WCL ) and the other lane corresponds to protein from inclusion bodies ( IB ) . The relative intensity of FP bands in the WCL and IB fractions , respectively , are : 17 and 7 for mEos2 ; 100 and 0 for mClavGR2 ; 113 and 0 for mMaple . Overall , mMaple shows the highest expression and folding efficiency with 100 % of the protein in the soluble fraction , while mEos2 has the lowest expression and folding efficiency with 29 % of the total expressed protein located in the IB fraction .
