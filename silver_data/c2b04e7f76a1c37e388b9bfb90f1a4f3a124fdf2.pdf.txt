Rheological Characterization of the Bundling Transition in F - Actin Solutions Induced by Methylcellulose Simone Ko¨hler , Oliver Lieleg , Andreas R . Bausch * Lehrstuhl fu¨r Biophysik E27 , Technische Universita¨t Mu¨nchen , Garching , Germany Abstract In many in vitro experiments Brownian motion hampers quantitative data analysis . Therefore , additives are widely used to increase the solvent viscosity . For this purpose , methylcellulose ( MC ) has been proven highly effective as already small concentrations can significantly slow down diffusive processes . Beside this advantage , it has already been reported that high MC concentrations can alter the microstructure of polymer solutions such as filamentous actin . However , it remains to be shown to what extent the mechanical properties of a composite actin / MC gel depend on the MC concentration . In particular , significant alterations might occur even if the microstructure seems unaffected . Indeed , we find that the viscoelastic response of entangled F - actin solutions depends sensitively on the amount of MC added . At concentrations higher than 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) MC , actin filaments are reorganized into bundles which drastically changes the viscoelastic response . At small MC concentrations the impact of MC is more subtle : the two constituents , actin and MC , contribute in an additive way to the mechanical response of the composite material . As a consequence , the effect of methylcellulose on actin solutions has to be considered very carefully when MC is used in biochemical experiments .

The cytoskeleton consists of semiflexible polymers such as actin filaments which are organized into complex scaffolds by various associated actin binding proteins . Cross - linking and bundling of actin filaments are major strategies used for structural fortification of the cytoskeleton ; however , filament bundling is also a governing strategy in cell motility as bundled filopodia are built up at the edge of a crawling cell [ 1 ] or actin comet tails consisting of bundled filaments propel bacteria inside their host cells [ 2 ] . Due to the biological complexity , it is a challenging task to track down the molecular origin of these dynamic processes . Therefore , in vitro experiments have been proven essential as reconstituted model systems enable the investigation of biochemical and physical contributions separately [ 3 ] . However , in many studies on dynamic processes Brownian motion hampers the data analysis . Increasing the viscosity of the investigated solution is helpful for reducing this problem . For this purpose , methylcellulose ( MC ) , a polymer that forms highly viscous solutions , is widely used at concentrations of 0 . 2 – 0 . 5 % [ 4 – 10 ] . MC is not known to specifically interact with actin or other cellular proteins ; however , it has been reported that actin / MC bundles appear at MC concentrations higher than 0 . 3 % ( w / v ) [ 11 , 12 ] , and thus biochemical experiments using MC in this concentration range have to be analyzed with care . Similarly , actin filaments can be bundled by high concentrations of polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) even in the absence of specific actin bundling proteins . The effect of PEG on the structure and mechanics of F - actin is purely entropic and has been studied extensively [ 13 , 14 ] . At PEG concentrations below the bundling transition , depletion forces lead to increasingly effective physical cross - links giving rise to an increase in the elasticity of the actin / PEG solution [ 15 ] . Because of the higher molecular weight of MC used in this study it is a priori not clear if MC can also act as an effective depletion agent . Moreover , a mixture of two polymer solutions might give rise to additional effects influencing the structure and mechanical response of the composite material . In contrast to the well characterized actin / PEG system , only structural information is available for actin / MC solutions [ 11 , 12 ] . Here , we use macrorheology to investigate the frequency dependent mechanical response of F - actin solutions in the presence of distinct MC concentrations . Macrorheology allows quantifying the viscous and elastic part of the mechanical response of a polymer solution and therefore is a suitable tool to separate changes in solvent viscosity from alterations in the viscoelastic response of the solved polymers . We systematically analyze the effect of increasing MC concentrations on the frequency dependent mechanical response of entangled F - actin solutions . Significant changes in the macrorheological behavior of the solution occur even at MC concentrations as low as 0 . 01 % ( w / v ) – however , the structure of the actin solution remains unaffected . At concentrations higher than 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) we report drastic changes in the viscoelastic response of the solution which can be traced back to filament bundling , in agreement with previous work [ 12 ] . Results Even in the absence of specific actin bundling proteins , actin filaments can be organized into bundles by methylcellulose as PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 July 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 7 | e2736 reported by [ 11 ] . Popp et al . have demonstrated that the bundling transition of 10 m M filamentous actin occurs at 0 . 3 % ( w / v ) MC [ 12 ] . Confocal micrographs of actin / MC gels at distinct amounts of MC are depicted in figure 1 . Actin bundles cannot be observed at low ( , 0 . 01 % ( w / v ) ) and intermediate ( , 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) ) MC concentrations . However , at a critical concentration of 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) actin / MC bundles start to form . Surprisingly , the thickness of the actin / MC bundles does not increase with increasing MC concentrations but rather seems to decrease while more and more bundles occur . This result is in contrast to the bundling effect caused by PEG where a monotonous increase in the bundle thickness was observed with increasing PEG concentrations [ 15 ] . The average thickness of actin / MC bundles can be estimated from phase contrast microscopy pictures depicted in the insets of figure 2 and is on the order of hundreds of nanometers . The obtained thicknesses are comparable to those reported for actin bundles that are induced by depletion forces in the presence of PEG [ 15 ] but are considerably larger compared to bundles that are formed by actin bundling proteins such as fascin [ 16 ] . As already stated , bundles cannot be observed at MC concentrations below the critical concentration of 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) . In this regime , the contrast is quite low even for confocal images . This is due to the fact that confocal microscopy cannot easily resolve single filaments at high actin concentrations and indicates that only single filaments are present . To overcome the limitations of optical microscopy , we use rheological methods to study the actin / MC gels in more detail . The viscoelastic frequency response of actin gels depends sensitively on the microstructure [ 17 – 21 ] . The occurrence of stiff bundles can lead to changes in the deformation mode of the gel [ 16 ] , attractive interactions between single filaments as induced by entropic depletion forces can serve as virtual cross - links and therefore significantly affect the frequency spectrum of single filaments [ 15 ] . The loss modulus , G 0 ( f ) , and storage modulus , G 9 ( f ) , of pure MC solutions and composite actin / MC gels are shown in figure 3 for distinct MC concentrations , c MC . The viscous modulus of the MC solutions , G 0 ( f ) , is dramatically increased with increasing amounts of MC ( fig . 3 , right lower panel ) . However , the viscosity of the solution is not independent from frequency as expected for a purely viscous fluid . Instead , a plateau emerges at low frequencies becoming more pronounced with increasing MC concentrations . If MC is added to a solution of entangled actin filaments , a qualitative similar behavior is observed for actin / MC gels at low MC concentrations ( fig . 3 , left lower panel ) : The G 0 ( f ) spectrum as obtained for pure actin solutions is shifted to higher values in the presence of MC . However , the increase in the loss modulus is not monotonic over the whole concentration range as a significant drop in the loss modulus occurs at c MC < 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) . This indicates that for a solution of semi - flexible polymers such as actin filaments the presence of MC affects not only the solvent viscosity but might also lead to an interaction with the polymers . Figure 1 . Methylcellulose induced actin bundle formation . Confocal micrographs of F - actin solutions ( 9 . 5 m M ) with increasing methylcellulose concentrations . Bundles appear at a MC concentration of 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) , below this concentration only single filaments can be observed . At 1 % MC , much more bundles occur which seem to be thinner than those formed at lower MC concentrations ( scale bar : 10 m m ) . The color code corresponds to the three regimes depicted in figure 2 . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0002736 . g001 Figure 2 . Plateau modulus of actin / MC solutions . The plateau modulus G 0 of actin / MC solutions is depicted as a function of MC concentration , c MC . Three regimes can be distinguished : At low c MC ( below 0 . 01 % , green ) the plateau modulus is similar to that of an entangled F - actin solution . For intermediate c MC ( 0 . 01 – 0 . 2 % , blue ) a weak increase in G 0 , c MC0 . 3 is observed . Above c MC = 0 . 2 % ( red ) the dependence of G 0 on c MC becomes more complex .

G 9 ( f ) and G 0 ( f ) of actin / MC solutions increase with increasing MC concentration for c MC # 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) , the critical concen - tration . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0002736 . g003 Composite Actin / MC Gels PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 July 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 7 | e2736 To test this hypothesis the elastic part of the frequency response of actin / MC gels is investigated . The G 9 ( f ) spectra at distinct MC concentrations are shown in figure 3 ( left upper panel ) . In the presence of MC the elasticity is significantly enhanced . Additionally , the elastic spectrum becomes astonishingly flat at high MC concentrations ( c MC . 0 . 2 % ) . Interestingly , the absolute values of G 9 ( f ) of pure MC solutions are on the same order of magnitude as G 9 ( f ) of actin / MC gels , which is consistent with previously published results for pure MC solutions [ 22 ] . It is important to note , that the viscoelastic response of MC solutions is highly non - linear as it crucially depends on the applied strain , while the response of actin / MC solutions is linear at low strain . Therefore , the spectra of MC solutions were recorded at the same strain as the corresponding actin / MC gels to allow for direct comparison of the spectra . In order to quantify the dependence of the storage modulus of actin / MC gels on the MC concentration , the plateau modulus G 0 = G 9 ( 0 . 02 Hz ) is analyzed ( fig . 2 ) . Three different regimes emerge with respect to c MC : At low MC concentrations ( c MC , 0 . 01 % ( w / v ) ) the plateau modulus G 0 is independent from c MC . At intermediate MC concentrations between 0 . 01 and 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) the plateau modulus increases monotonically with c MC , G 0 , c MC0 . 3 . In the third regime at MC concentrations higher than 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) the modulus depends on the MC concentration in a non - trivial manner and cannot be described by a simple mathematical function any more . In each of the last two regimes the elasticity of the composite material reaches values larger than those of the two constituting components alone . This indicates , that assuming that one component ( e . g . the F - actin solution alone ) dominates the mechanical response of the composite gel is not sufficient to rationalize the observed viscoelastic response . Another simple approach is to assume , that the polymer systems are mechanically independent from each other resulting in an additive behavior . Indeed , this approximation is valid in the second regime between 0 . 01 and 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) MC ( fig . 4 ) . This indicates that the structure and mechanical response of entangled actin filaments is not influenced by MC at intermediate concentrations . At higher MC concentrations ( . 0 . 2 % ) the spectra of the two constituents can no longer be summed up to reproduce the mechanical response of the composite material . Here , not only the absolute values of the moduli G 9 ( f ) and G 0 ( f ) are changed but also the shape of the spectra is affected : A flattening of G 9 ( f ) at low frequencies is observed which is unusual for an entangled F - actin solution but is a typical signature of cross - linked or bundled actin gels [ 16 , 19 , 23 , 24 ] . This confirms that the structure of the F - actin solution is significantly changed by high MC concentrations . Discussion High concentrations of MC ( c MC . 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) ) are able to induce actin bundling as has been shown here by confocal and phase contrast microscopy in agreement with previous studies [ 11 , 12 ] . This bundle transition correlates well with major changes in the frequency dependent mechanical response of actin / MC solutions . High MC concentrations alter the mechanics of F - actin solutions by an initial decrease in the elastic response . This may result from an effective increase in mesh size caused by bundling of the actin filaments which is supported by confocal images ( Fig . 1 ) : At 0 . 2 % MC individual bundles occur while at 0 . 5 % MC a bundle network is observed . The rearrangement of filaments into thick bundles weakens the network elasticity by locally concentrating material and thus creating a network with a huge mesh size . Surprisingly , this trend does not persist throughout the whole MC concentration range and a sudden increase in the plateau modulus is observed at 1 % ( w / v ) MC . Concomitant with this abrupt change in the mechanical behavior a completely different network morphology is observed at this high MC concentration ( fig . 1 ) . The observed structural changes agree well with the mechanical properties determined with macrorheology . The occurrence of actin bundles in the presence of small inert polymers can in principle be attributed to entropic effects known as depletion forces . Entropic actin bundling was reported for actin / PEG 6 k solutions by Tharmann et al . , where bundles started to form at 2 % ( w / w ) PEG at 9 . 5 m M actin [ 15 ] . Considering the higher molecular weight of MC ( 88 kDa ) the corresponding bundling transition should occur at roughly 5 % ( w / v ) MC . However , the critical bundling concentration for MC is an order of magnitude lower compared to this calculated value . This indicates that additional contributions to the interaction potential between actin filaments might occur in the MC system . In Figure 4 . Additive behavior of the viscoelastic response of actin / MC solutions in the intermediate concentration regime . The experimental frequency response of mixed actin / MC solutions ( dark blue circles ) is compared to the calculated frequency spectrum ( light blue squares ) assuming additive behavior as described in the text . Frequency spectra of pure actin are shown as a reference ( black lines ) . At intermediate MC concentrations ( 0 . 01 % and 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) ) the additive behavior holds , while at high MC concentrations significant deviations occur . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0002736 . g004 Composite Actin / MC Gels PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 3 July 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 7 | e2736 particular , the presence of the MC network might impede the formation of a fully equilibrated actin network structure . As a consequence , kinetic trapping effects might play a role [ 25 ] and might explain the occurrence of thinner bundles at high MC concentration . More subtle changes in the viscoelastic behavior of actin / MC solutions are induced by intermediate MC concentrations ( between 0 . 01 and 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) ) . Here , no bundles can be detected by phase contrast and confocal microscopy . In this regime , the enhancement of the network elasticity can roughly be approxi - mated by a power law , G 0 , c MC0 . 3 . A similar regime showing a weak increase in the network elasticity has been determined for actin / PEG solutions below the bundling transition . There , G 0 , c PEG0 . 2 was observed and attributed to increasing attractive forces between single filaments upon addition of depletion agent [ 15 ] . However , a similar scaling law does not directly imply that the same molecular mechanisms are responsible for the enhance - ment of the elasticity . Recall , that MC solutions themselves show a viscoelastic behavior which is not observable for PEG solutions at these low concentrations . In marked contrast to purely viscous fluids the loss modulus of MC solutions does not follow G 0 ( f ) = g / ( 2 p f ) ( fig . 3 ) and a significant elastic response is observed . Surprisingly , the absolute values of G 0 ( f ) as well as G 9 ( f ) are on the same order of magnitude as the viscoelastic response of F - actin solutions alone . This suggests that MC concentrations as low as 0 . 01 % ( w / v ) might already be beyond the overlap concentration creating an entangled viscoelastic material . In fact , the critical concentration of a slightly smaller MC was found to be 0 . 03 % ( w / v ) [ 26 ] which corresponds well to our findings considering the small differences in the molecular weight . Due to the significant viscoelastic properties of pure MC solutions themselves , in this intermediate MC concentration regime both components , the F - actin and the MC solution , contribute to the mechanical response of the composite material – at least in the elasticity dominated frequency regime investigated in this study . The structural organization of the actin solution seems not to be altered by low concentrations of MC . Thus , the elastic regime between 10 mHz and 5 Hz will be dominated by the entanglements of both polymer solutions and no cooperative influence on the elasticity ( or the viscous dissipation ) in this low frequency regime would be expected . This gives rise to the simple additive behavior that is observed for both viscoelastic moduli . Matters might be different at higher frequencies ( typically around , 1 kHz and above ) where Rouse - like fluctuations of single filaments in a viscous medium determine the viscoelastic response of an entangled actin solution [ 27 , 28 ] or cross - linked actin networks [ 21 ] . At such high frequencies the presence of MC might very well have additional effects on the frequency response of the actin solution which could defy a simple addition of distinct frequency spectra in this regime . However , in the experimentally more relevant frequency regime , 5 Hz the observed mechanical additivity provides a simple method to derive the mechanical properties of a polymer solution from a polymer / MC mixture . Using a simple calibration measurement of the pure MC solution , the viscoelastic response of MC can be subtracted from the response of the polymer / MC solution . In contrast , due to structural changes at MC concentra - tions c MC . 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) this strategy is not applicable in the high concentration regime . In conclusion , methylcellulose is not suitable to simply increase the viscosity of polymer solutions as MC can significantly alter the structure and mechanics of entangled F - actin solutions at concentrations higher than 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) MC . Theses alterations are observed over the whole elasticity dominated frequency regime studied here which also represents the time frame of typical biological and biochemical experiments . Therefore , MC should very cautiously be used to determine biochemical processes that take place on comparable time scales . In the intermediate concentration regime , the contribution of MC can be subtracted from the frequency spectra of the storage and loss modulus . This is no longer possible above the critical concentration , as the structural changes induced by MC defy a simple analysis of the mechanical properties of the bundled network . However , below the critical concentration the solvent viscosity cannot be increased sufficiently which drastically limits the utility of MC . Materials and Methods Protein preparation Actin is prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle [ 29 ] and stored in lyophilized form at - 20 u C . For measurements the lyophilized actin is dissolved in deionized water and dialyzed against G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris ( pH 8 ) , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM DTT and 0 . 005 % NaN 3 ) at 4 u C . The G - actin solutions are stored at 4 u C and used within seven days of preparation . The average length of the actin filaments is controlled by adding gelsolin which is isolated from bovine plasma serum [ 30 , 31 ] . Sample preparation Samples are prepared by gently mixing deionized water with gelsolin and G - actin and buffered to 2 mM Tris / HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 100 mM KCl and 0 . 5 mM ATP . Methylcellulose ( Sigma M0512 , approx . 88 kDa , viscosity 4000 cP if dissolved 2 % ( w / v ) in H 2 O ) is dissolved in deionized water to 2 % ( w / v ) or less and added to the sample before actin polymerization was induced . An actin concentration of 9 . 5 m M , an average filament length of 21 m m and a measuring temperature of 21 u C is used . For experiments with pure MC solutions deionized water is used instead of G - buffer . Rheology Approximately 460 m L sample volume are loaded into a commercial stress controlled rheometer ( Physica MCR301 , Anton Paar , Graz , Austria ) with a 50 mm plate - plate geometry and 160 m m plate separation . During polymerization the storage modulus G 9 ( 0 . 5 Hz ) is monitored to ensure completed polymer - ization before measurements . Oscillatory measurements are performed with constant strain ranging from 1 . 5 % to 10 % , depending on the sample rigidity . Phase contrast microscopy Samples prepared as described above were filled into micro - scope chambers prior to polymerization . 1 h after the polymer - ization was initiated , the samples are investigated by phase contrast microscopy using a 63 6 oil immersion objective ( 1 . 4 numerical aperture ) . Confocal microscopy The samples were prepared as described for phase contrast microscopy . However , actin filaments were stained by adding 0 . 95 m M phalloidin - tetramethylrhodamine ( Sigma ) prior to poly - merization . Images were taken 1 h after polymerization was induced using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope . Images were processed with Leica Microsystems LAS AF software and show maximal intensity projections of either time series ( for 0 % – 0 . 1 % MC samples ) or z - stacks ( for 0 . 2 % – 1 % MC samples ) .
