However , the underlying mechanisms through which SA prevents DC in human lens epithelial cells ( HLECs ) remained unclear . In the present study , we employed single - molecule optics technologies , including transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) , laser scanning confocal microscopy ( LSCM ) and Raman spec - troscopy , to monitor the effect of SA on HLECs biomechanics and organelle structure in real - time . TEM suggested that SA improved the ultrastructure of HLECs with regard to nuclear chromatin condensation and reducing mitochondrial swelling and degeneration , which may aid in the maintenance of HLECs integrity in the presence of glucose . AFM revealed a reduced surface roughness and stiffness following SA treatment , suggesting an improved viscoelasticity of HELCs . Raman spectrometry and LSCM further revealed that these changes were related to a modification of cell liquidity and cytoskeletal structure by SA . Taken together , these results provide insights into the effects of SA on the biomechanics of HLECs and further strengthen the evidence for its potential use as a novel therapeutic strategy for DC prevention . Keywords Syringic acid . Human lens epithelial cells . Diabetic cataract . Interaction . Biomechanics Introduction Cataract is a primary cause of visual impairment in diabetic patients and , due to the rising incidence of diabetes , diabetic cataract ( DC ) constitutes an emerging global health problem ( Abdel - Ghaffar et al . 2018 ; Goutham et al . 2017 ; Hwang et al . 2019 ; Peterson et al . 2018 ) . Surgery is currently the main therapeutic option for DC ( Boscia et al . 2017 ) , but there is a high risk of complications , including diabetic macular edema , diabetic retinopathy progression , and posterior capsular opacification , associated with cataract surgery in these pa - tients ( Yang et al . 2017 ; Peterson et al . 2018 ) . Therefore , it is critical to investigate novel efficient therapeutic strategies against DC . Lens epithelial cells ( LECs ) play an important role in the protection of the lens and the maintenance of lens transparen - cy ( Sorkou et al . 2019 ) . Previous research findings suggest that during the development of DC , several pathological pro - cesses occur , including , an increased osmotic pressure due to an activation of the polyol pathway , an imbalance of redox state due to disruptions of the oxidative stress pathway , and an accumulation of advanced glycation end - products in the gly - cosylation pathway . These processes result in the breakdown of cellular structure and disrupt the intracellular homeostasis of LECs ( Bhadada et al . 2016 ; Obrosova et al . 2010 ) , resulting in opacification of the lens ( Yang and Zhang 2015 ) . Alterations in cellular mechanics ( structure , adhesion , and mobility ) may also be associated with increased lens opacity ( Maddala et al . 2016 ) . Furthermore , proliferation and migration of LECs have been observed after cata - ract surgery and have been suggested to cause capsular opacity and other postoperative complications ( Wertheimer et al . 2014 ; Choi et al . 2012 ) . Syringic acid ( 4 - hydroxy - 3 , 5 - dimethoxybenzoic acid , PubChem CID : 10742 , SA ) is an active ingredient extracted from D . aurantiacum var . denneanum ( kerr ) , which is a tra - ditional Chinese medicine herb used for treatment of diabetes ( Shen - ntonz ’ s Classic of Materia Medica ) .

However , the underlying molecular changes in the structure , behavior and microenvironment of HLECs following SA treatment were unclear so far . LECs stimulated with high glucose levels exhibit an in - creased expression of aldose reductase and an activation of the polyol pathway ( Kanchan et al . 2016 ; Petrovi č 2014 ) . These processes are highly similar to pathological processes occurring in DC development . Therefore , we used HLECs stimulated with high glucose levels as an in vitro model to explore the effects of SA on structure and behavior of LECs . We applied single - molecule optics technologies , such as transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , atomic force mi - croscopy ( AFM ) , and laser scanning confocal microscopy ( LSCM ) to observe the mechanical structure , adhesion , mo - bility and other dynamic behaviors in HLECs after treatment with SA . We found that biomechanics of these cells were modified by SA treatment , and these findings are critical for further characterization of SA as a therapeutic for DC prevention . Materials and methods Reagents Minimum essential medium ( MEM ) , phosphate buffered solu - tion ( PBS ) and penicillin - streptomycin and 0 . 25 % trypsin were purchased from Gibco ( Grand Island , NY , USA ) ; fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) was purchased from Biological Industries ( Beit Haemek , Israel ) ; glucose was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation ( Shang Hai , China ) ; rhodamine was pur - chased from Enzo Life Sicences ( Farmingdale , NY , USA ) ; DAPI ( 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ) was purchased from Yeasen ( Shanghai , China ) ; triton - 100 was purchased from Dingguo Changsheng biotech Co . Ltd . ( Beijing , China ) ; Syringic acid was extracted at a purity greater than 98 % using the method previously described by Zhang et al . ( 2008 ) . The HLEC line SRA01 / 04 was a kind gift from the Ophthalmology Center of the Sun Yat - Sen University ( China ) . Instruments The following instruments were used for our experiments : CO 2 incubators ( Scientific , Thermo , German ) ; transmission electron microscopy ( TEM , tecnai G2 spilit twin , FEI , Czech Republic ) . ; atomic force microscopy ( AFM , Dimension Fast Scan , Bruker , German ) ; Micro - Raman spec - trometer ( Renishawinvia , Renishaw , England ) ; ZEISS LSM800 LSCM ( Carl Zeiss Microcopy GmbH , Göttingen , Germany ) . HLECs culture and treatment groups SRA01 / 04 cells were cultured in complete MEM with 10 % of FBS and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin . After cells reached 80 % confluence , cells were digested with trypsin and used for ex - periments . HLECs were divided into three groups ( n = 5 ) : a control group ( 10 % FBS in MEM ) ; a model group ( 50 mM glucose + 10 % FBS in MEM ) ; SA group ( 0 . 5 μ M SA + 50 mM glucose + 10 % FBS in MEM ) . In the SA group , glu - cose and SA were added to the medium at the same time . Transmission electron microscopy HLECs were seeded into 60 mm culture plates at a density of 5 × 10 4 cells / well . After treatment for 24 h , cells were collected for TEM . HLECs were washed with PBS for 5 min and fixed in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M PBS ( pH 7 . 3 ) . After fixation with glutaraldehyde , cells were washed with PBS three times and post - fixed in 1 . 2 % osmium tetroxide in PBS . The cells were then dehydrated with ethanol and acetone , and embedded in EPON . Ultrathin sections ( 70 – 90 nm thick ) were stained with acetic acid uranium . Finally , ultrathin sections were collected on naked copper grids to be visualized by TEM . Atomic force microscopy Live HLECs were visualized by AFM after treatment for 24 h with the following parameters : scanning speed = 0 . 2 Hz ; cantile - ver elastic coefficient = 1 – 3 N / M ; approach velocity = 0 . 5 μ m / s ; scan size = 30 – 50 μ m 2 per cell . Cells were observed for 1 – 2 h in each group , during which cells remained viable ( as previously described by Preedy et al . 2014 ) . Surface roughness and stiffness were assessed using cell surface topography images , with 10 – 15 areas of 5 × 5 μ m . The nanoscope analysis software was employed for the analysis of AFM images . Quantitative parameters of average roughness ( Ra ) and root - mean - squared roughness ( Rq ) values were used to inves - tigate the roughness of cells , calculated using formula ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , respectively . N was the sampling point and Z was the height of Z axis ( Lara - Cruz et al . 2016 ) .

The relation - ship between the loading force , F in spherical probe , and inden - tation , δ , could be described by the formula ( 3 ) ( Alsteens et al . 2008 ) , where R was the radius of the tip and E r was the reduced 276 J Bioenerg Biomembr ( 2021 ) 53 : 275 – 284 Young ’ s modulus . A reduced Young ’ s modulus E r was correlat - ed with the Young ’ s modulus of simple E s , which is described by formula ( 4 ) ( Alsteens et al . 2008 ) . V T and V S were the Poisson ratio of the tips and samples . The Poisson ratio of cell was as - sumed to be 0 . 5 ( Nijenhuis et al . 2010 ) . F δ ð Þ ¼ 4 3 ﬃﬃﬃﬃ R p E r δ 3 = 2 ð 3 Þ 1 E r ¼ 1 − V t2 E T þ 1 − v S2 E S ð 4 Þ Raman spectroscopy HLECs were collected by centrifugation at 3000 g for 5 min after treatment , washed three times , re - suspended in PBS , and visualized using the Raman scattering spectra . A Raman spectral range of 0 – 4000 cm − 1 and 10 – 15 spectra per group was used for the Raman spectroscopy ( as previously described by Nijenhuis et al . 2010 ) . The excitation wavelength was 633 nm . The spot diameter was 1 . 5um , and the testing time was 30 s for each sample ( three times per sample ) . An integration time of 90 s and a low laser power ( 50 % ) were used for spectral acquisition to avoid cellular damage . For Raman spectroscopy , the chain in longitudinal order - parameters ( S trans ) and lateral interaction between chain param - eters ( S lat ) of membranes were used to further investigate the fluidity of HLECs following SA treatment ( previously described by Anthony 1982 ) . S trans and S lat were used to detect changes in the lipid bilayer structure in living cells and a Raman line at 1655 cm − 1 ( CH2 - bending mode ) showed a sensitive means to monitor the modulation of lipids in biological cells ( Bogliolo et al . 2013 ) . S trans and S lat were calculated using the follow equations , respectively ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) ( Anthony 1982 ) , S lat ¼ I CH2 control − 0 : 7 1 : 5 ð 5 Þ Fig . 1 Morphological features of glucose - stimulated HLECs treated with SA under TEM . a1 – 3 show with normal ultrastructure , characterized by regular mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum in HLECs ; b1 – 3 show the HLECs induced with 50 mM glucose with obvious vacuoles ( b1 ) , abnormal cristae in mitochondria ( b2 ) and endoplasmic reticulum ( b3 ) ; c1 – 3 show decreased vacuoles ( c1 ) , increased normal cristae in mito - chondria ( c2 ) and endoplasmic reticulum ( c3 ) .

Laser scanning confocal microscopy HLECs on glass coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed with 95 % ethyl alcohol for 2 h after treatment . Samples were permeabilized with 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 for 30 min and washed twice with PBS . Cells were then incubated with rhodamine dye solution for 1 h to stain F - actin in the cytoskeleton , and DAPI was used to counterstain the nucleus . Images were captured using the LSCM . Statistical analysis All data are presented as the mean ± SD of at least three inde - pendent experiments . Spss22 . 0 software was used for the analysis of variance . Comparisons between groups were car - ried out using the unpaired two - tailed Student ` s t - test and one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) . Differences were consid - ered statistically significant when P < 0 . 05 . Results Ultrastructural changes following glucose stimulation are alleviated by SA treatment TEM images are shown in Fig . 1 . HLECs in the control group showed intact organelles in the cytoplasm , a clearly demarcat - ed membrane , a regular nucleus , and mitochondria with clear and complete cristae ( Fig . 1 , a1 – 3 ) . However , in the glucose - Fig . 2 AFM topographic images of normal HLECs ( a1 – 3 ) , 50 mM glucose treated HLECs ( b1 – 3 ) and SA - treated 50 mM glucose - induced HLECs ( c1 – 3 ) .

White arrows in ( a1 , b1 , c1 ) indicate the difference in cell membranes between the three groups 278 J Bioenerg Biomembr ( 2021 ) 53 : 275 – 284 induced model group , we observed a highly vacuolated cyto - plasm ( Fig . 1 , b1 ) , deformation of cells , vacuolization and abnormal cristae of mitochondria ( Fig . 1 , b2 ) , and a swollen endoplasmic reticulum without ribosomes ( Fig . 1 , b3 ) . Following SA treatment , these changes were reversed , show - ing an alleviation of cytoplasmic vacuolation ( Fig . 1 , c1 ) , more definition of mitochondrial cristae ( Fig . 1 , c2 ) , and res - cue of endoplasmic reticulum structure compared to the model group ( Fig . 1 , c3 ) . SA restores membrane integrity of HLECs Morphological changes of HLECs are shown in Fig . 2 . In the model group , the surface morphology of HLECs was highly folded compared to the control group ( Fig . 2 , b1 – 3 ) , which was decreased by SA treatment ( Fig . 2 , c1 – 3 ) . A cross - sectional deformation profile ( Fig . 3 ) revealed a HLEC height of 3 . 3 ± 0 . 15 , 1 . 8 ± 0 . 35 , 2 . 3 ± 0 . 12 μ m in control group , model group , and SA group , respectively . These findings demonstrated that SA could partially restore the height of cells in the presence of high glucose . SA reduces roughness and Young ’ s modulus of HLECs The Ra and Rq of HLECs were 112 . 25 ± 2 . 01 nm and 155 ± 3 . 07 nm in the control group , 144 . 2 ± 4 . 13 nm and 176 . 6 ± 3 . 54 nm in the model group , and 132 . 9 ± 4 . 56 nm and 161 ± 5 . 28 nm in the SA group , respectively ( Fig . 5 a ) , as quantified from AFM images ( Fig . 4 ) . In the model group , the membrane of HLECs became much rougher compared to the control group ( p < 0 . 01 , Fig . 4 , a1 – 2 , b1 – 2 ; Fig . 5a ) . However , SA treatment significantly reduced HLEC roughness following Fig . 3 Representative AFM images of normal HLECs ( a1 – 2 ) , 50 mM glucose treated HLECs ( b1 – 2 ) and SA - treated HLECs stimulated with 50 mM glucose ( c1 – 2 ) .

Furthermore , the Young ’ s modulus was 5 . 5 ± 0 . 09 KPa in the control group , 12 . 1 ± 0 . 12 KPa in the model group , and 7 . 8 ± 0 . 13 KPa in the SA group ( Fig . 5b ) . These findings demonstrated that SA treatment both decreased the cell surface roughness and Young ’ s modulus of HLECs in the presence of high glucose . SA improves membrane liquidity of HLECs following glucose stimulation We used Raman spectroscopy to estimate the lipid composi - tion of the cell membrane of HLECs . The Raman spectrum after 24 h SA treatment in HLECs is shown in Fig . 6 . Characteristic peaks appeared at 1003 , 1065 , 1298 , 1448 , 1659 , 2598 , 2937 , 3068 , 3340 cm − 1 for interaction time of the control group , and the Raman peak was changed at 2606 cm − 1 in the model group , and 2756 cm − 1 in the SA group . Relating to lipids , the CH2 - bending mode was related to the peaks at 1448 and 1141 cm − 1 , and the C = C - stretching mode was related to the peaks at 1659 and 1655 cm − 1 . S lat and S trans were 1 . 23 ± 0 . 11 and 0 . 83 ± 0 . 09 in the control group , 1 . 70 ± 0 . 19 and 0 . 92 ± 0 . 18 in the model group , and 1 . 72 ± 0 . 16 and 0 . 84 ± 0 . 08 in the SA group , respectively ( Table . 1 ) . S trans and S lat were significantly increased in the model group compared to the control group ( p < 0 . 05 ) , which indicated that Fig . 4 AFM images for peak force error of normal HLECs ( a1 – 2 ) , 50 mM glucose treated HLECs ( b1 – 2 ) and SA - treated 50 mM glucose - induced HLECs ( c1 – 2 ) .

Compared with the model group , S trans was decreased in the SA group ( p < 0 . 05 ) , which suggested that SA could improve cell liquidity , although S lat did not change significantly . Cytoskeletal disruptions are alleviated following SA treatment In the control group , F - actin was distributed regularly and displayed filamentous morphology in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 7 , a1 – 4 ) , but in the model group , F - actin was disordered , dispersed and twisted throughout the entire cytoplasm ( Fig . 7 , b1 – 4 ) . In comparison to that , the disordered cytoplasm near the cellular periphery was rescued following SA treatment ( Fig . 7 , c1 – 4 ) . Discussion LECs play a critical role in the maintenance of lens transpar - ency ( Maddala et al . 2020 ) . Lens transparency has been sug - gested to be associated with mechanical properties of the lens , such as stiffness ( Stanga et al . 1999 ) . We have previously shown that SA can improve transparency of lens both in vivo and in vitro ( Wei et al . 2012 ) , which we have attributed to an inhibition of aldose reductase activity via impaired tran - scription and suppression of the polyol pathway ( Wu et al . 2016 ) . Nonetheless , the effects of SA on LEC biomechanics remained unclear . Our findings in this study using live cells to demonstrate , for the first time , that SA can improve HLECs function by modulating biomechanics and organelle structure . Previous studies have suggested that HLECs are highly sensitive to structural damage following high glucose stimu - lation , but this may be alleviated by inhibition of pathways involved in oxidative stress and the polyol metabolism ( Ou et al . 2008 ; Kubo et al . 1999 ) . Mitochondria are a major source of intracellular reactive oxygen species ( Liu et al . 2020 ) . It has been reported that excessive reactive oxygen species may promote cataract formation by disrupting the re - dox state in lens ( Xu et al . 2018 ) , and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species has previously been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and potential structural damage ( Rizwan et al . 2020 ) . Furthermore , endoplasmic reticulum stress , resulting in structural damage , has been observed in LECs in the progression of DC ( Periyasamy and Shinohara 2017 ; Tran et al . 2019 ) . In this study , TEM indicated that SA treatment alleviated structural damage , for example to mito - chondria and the endoplasmic reticulum , induced by high glu - cose stimulation in HLECs . Cytoskeletal reorganization affects cellular topography , which indicates that changes in mechanical properties of cel - lular morphology could reflect on structural changes of the cell membrane in HLECs and could help uncover dynamic behaviors of cells ( Khandaker et al . 2016 ; Oprisan et al . 2016 ; Li et al . 2016 ) . Previously , cytoskeletal changes have been shown to coincide with roughness and stiffness of the cell membrane , which ultimately caused a decrease in cell viscoelasticity and led to changes of cellular biodynamics ( Rothdiener et al . 2016 ; Ge et al . 2016 ; Gavara 2017 ) . In the present study , AFM showed a greatly increased stiffness in the model group ( 2 . 2 increased compared to the control group ) . Meanwhile , the stiffness after SA treatment was only 1 . 4 times that of the control group . These real - time observations indicated that SA could reduce the surface roughness and stiffness of the cell membrane of HLECs . Therefore , these results , for the first time , suggest a role of the cellular mech - anisms of HLECs in glucose - induced cataract . In addition to membrane roughness and stiffness , the com - position of the phospholipid bilayer also plays a key role in cellular structure and function ( Moussa et al . 2017 ) . Raman spectroscopy has previously been applied to detect structural changes of hydrocarbon chains to reveal the characteristics of cellular lipids and phospholipids ( Suga et al . 2015 ) . Raman spectroscopy can provide the information on the trans or gauche Fig . 6 Change of Raman spectra with or without SA treatment . There were three groups ( control group , model group , SA group ) in this experiment Table 1 S lat and S trans after treatment with SA following Raman spectroscopy Groups S lat S trans Control group 1 . 23±0 . 11 0 . 83±0 . 09 Model group 1 . 70±0 . 19 * * 0 . 92±0 . 18 * SA group 1 . 72±0 . 16 0 . 84±0 . 08 * * * P < 0 . 01 , model group compared with control group ; * P < 0 . 05 , SA group compared with model group .

As we demonstrated by Raman spectroscopy and LSCM , the membrane lipid structure and F - actin organization in the cyto - skeleton of HLECs was disrupted by high glucose concentra - tions , but could be rescued by SA treatment . F - actin is one of the integral structure proteins in the membrane , and F - actin changes are closely related to cellular morphology changes ( Staszowska et al . 2016 ; Fong - Ngern et al . 2017 ) . Our results suggested that SA could rescue F - actin disruption and resulted in a more uniform and tight network - like structure of cytoskel - eton in high glucose - stimulated HLECs . Combining results from AFM and Raman spectroscopy , these data suggested that a decreased lipid content in the cell membrane reduced cell fluidity , while damage to cytoskeletal proteins increased cellular stiffness and triggered morphological damage ( Dawaliby et al . 2016 ; Needham and Nunn 1990 ) . These pro - cesses could ultimately result in a decreased lipid and phospho - lipid content and increased stiffness of the lens ( Zelenka 1984 ) . Conclusion Single - molecule imaging in living cells revealed that SA could rescue the structure of HLECs in the context of high glucose - induced cataract . The increased surface roughness and stiffness of HLECs following SA treatment were due to a decreased cell liquidity and restored F - actin cytoskeletal organization . These results uncovered an effect of SA treat - ment on the mechanical properties of HLECs , which may ultimately provide a potential new strategy for DC treatment .
