We explore the joint eﬀects of group decision making and group gender com - position on the calibration of conﬁdence judgments . Participants in two laboratory exper - iments , individually and in groups of three , stated conﬁdence interval estimates for general - knowledge questions and for ﬁnancial forecasts . Across both studies , our results reveal that groups with at least one female member are signiﬁcantly better calibrated than all - male groups . This eﬀect is mediated by the extent to which group members share opin - ions and information during the group discussion . Moreover , we ﬁnd that compared to a statistical aggregation of individual conﬁdence intervals , group discussions have a neu - tral or positive eﬀect on the quality of conﬁdence judgments for groups with at least one female group member ; in contrast , group discussion actually harms conﬁdence calibration for all - male groups . Overall , our ﬁndings indicate that compared to all - male groups , even the inclusion of a small proportion of female members can have a strong eﬀect on the quality of group conﬁdence judgment .

Keywords : overconﬁdence • group judgments • gender diversity • group deliberation 1 . Introduction Decision makers in organizations frequently need to cope with severe uncertainty . In situations like these , adequate levels of conﬁdence may be just as impor - tant for organizational performance as the decisions’ actual quality ( e . g . , Sniezek 1992 , Sniezek and Henry 1989 ) . However , a large number of studies have shown that individuals’ level of conﬁdence is in fact not well calibrated . Instead , most people are systemati - cally overconﬁdent ; that is , they hold an excessive cer - tainty concerning the correctness and precision of their beliefs , judgments , and forecasts ( e . g . , Lichtenstein and Fischhoﬀ 1977 , Russo and Schoemaker 1992 , Soll and Klayman 2004 ) . Such miscalibration has been shown to have an important eﬀect on decision making in organi - zations . For example , overconﬁdent investors take too many risks , earn lower average returns , and underdi - versify their portfolios ( e . g . , Barber and Odean 2002 , Biais et al . 2005 ) . Similarly , results by Ben - David et al . ( 2013 ) show that ﬁrms with overconﬁdent chief ﬁnan - cial oﬃcers pursue more aggressive corporate policies suchaslargerinvestmentsandhigherdebtlevels , which exposes their companies to excessive risk . Conﬁdence judgments are also widely used in decision analysis ; therefore , overconﬁdence in managers’ judgments can have serious consequences for the quality of decisions that are based on this methodology ( Clemen 1996 ) . In the last several decades , following an ongoing shift from organizing work around individual jobs to team - based work structures , a large number of impor - tant judgments and decisions in organizations are now made by groups rather than by individuals ( e . g . , Kozlowski and Bell 2003 ) . Furthermore , due to the increasing diversity of the workforce as a whole , teams inorganizationsarenotonlybecomingmoreimportant , but also have become more diverse in terms of demo - graphic categories such as gender , age , and ethnicity ( e . g . , Triandis et al . 1994 ) . In particular , even though all - male groups are still a ubiquitous phenomenon in many areas such as upper management , boards of direc - tors , the ﬁnancial sector , and certain areas of academia , mixed - gender groups have become more and more common in the workplace ( e . g . , Heilman 2012 ) . Even though a substantial number of studies have explored the eﬀects of gender diversity on group per - formance in a variety of settings , such as small work teams ( e . g . , Jehn et al . 1999 , Wegge et al . 2008 ) , top man - agement teams ( e . g . , Dezsö and Ross 2012 , Krishnan 1 D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 137 . 132 . 123 . 69 ] on 27 J un e 2018 , a t 20 : 56 .

In this paper , we aim to address this question . Importantly , diﬀer - ent from previous research on overconﬁdence in group judgments that focused solely on a direct compari - son between individuals and groups ( e . g . , Plous 1995 , Russo and Schoemaker 1992 , Sniezek and Henry 1989 ) , we focus on comparing groups with diﬀerent gender compositions ; that is , groups with diﬀerent propor - tions of male and female members . In particular , we explore the link between ( a ) group gender composi - tion , ( b ) opinion and information sharing among group members during group deliberations , and ( c ) group conﬁdence calibration . Moreover , our study strives to provide insights into another question that has remained mostly unclear in prior research ( see , e . g . , Sniezek 1992 , Plous 1995 ) : Under what circumstances is group deliberation a remedy against overconﬁdence and when might it be ineﬀective or even exacerbate the problem ? In doing so , our work also provides additional in - sights into the eﬀects of gender diversity in the upper echelons of organizations . A large number of empirical studies have shown that the inclusion of women into top management teams and boards can have a substan - tial eﬀect on a variety of organizational outcomes such as ﬁnancial performance ( Post and Byron 2015 ) , risk taking ( Baixauli - Soler et al . 2015 ) , and ﬁnancial fraud ( Cumming et al . 2015 ) . Our research complements this prior work by helping to open the “black box” con - cerning the group processes that link group gender composition and the quality of group decisions . 2 . Hypotheses Development 2 . 1 . Conﬁdence Calibration in Individual Judgments A widely used method to assess conﬁdence calibration is to ask participants for subjective conﬁdence intervals for a number of unknown values . Miscalibration is then deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the conﬁdence level and the ratio of the number of times that the true value fallsinsideoftheconﬁdenceintervaloverthetotalnum - ber of questions , where a ratio lower ( resp . , higher ) than the conﬁdence level indicates overconﬁdence ( resp . , underconﬁdence ) . The most common ﬁnding in this paradigm is overconﬁdence . Even though the degree of observed overconﬁdence varies depending on the precise nature of the task at hand and the level of conﬁdence according to which individuals are asked to state ( e . g . , 90 % versus 50 % or 70 % ) , overconﬁdence has been demonstrated for estimates in a variety of domains such as general knowledge questions ( e . g . , Lichtenstein and Fischhoﬀ 1977 , Klayman et al . 1999 , Soll and Klayman 2004 ) , stock price forecasts ( Bude - scu and Du 2007 ) , or outcomes of sport games ( Tsai et al . 2008 ) . Moreover , overconﬁdence is not limited to estimates made by students in laboratory experi - ments , but also has been found frequently in judg - ments by professionals such as ﬁnancial traders ( Glaser et al . 2013 ) , stock market analysts ( Deaves et al . 2010 , Jain et al . 2013 ) , general managers ( Russo and Schoe - maker 1992 ) , and chief ﬁnancial oﬃcers ( Ben - David et al . 2013 ) . In contrast , systematic underconﬁdence with respect to conﬁdence calibration has only been very rarely observed ( Moore and Healy 2008 ) . Although the precise relationship between these variables is not perfect , in general , calibration is af - fected by both judgment accuracy and interval width . For example , decision makers might make relatively accurate judgments , but the estimates could still be badly calibrated if the conﬁdence intervals are set to be very narrow . Conversely , a decision maker could be very inaccurate but still achieve good calibration by setting conﬁdence intervals wide enough . 2 . 2 . Group Deliberation and Conﬁdence Calibration The general ﬁnding from the comparison between indi - viduals and groups with respect to conﬁdence calibra - tion is that groups are better calibrated than individu - als ( Plous 1995 , Russo and Schoemaker 1992 , Sniezek and Henry 1989 ) . Moreover , it appears that such im - proved calibration in groups compared to individuals is mostly driven by higher accuracy of group judg - ments rather than groups’ greater appreciation of their own limited knowledge . In particular , whereas group judgments in previous studies tended to be more accu - rate than those of individuals , the conﬁdence intervals set by groups were not wider or in many cases even narrower than those set by individuals ( Sniezek 1992 , Plous 1995 ) . In principle , groups have access to a larger and more diverse pool of information than individuals ( e . g . , Hinsz et al . 1997 , Levine and Smith 2013 ) , and group members can exchange arguments in favor of or against a certain position , which should help them to better assess the degree of uncertainty in their judgments ( Sniezek and Henry 1989 , Sniezek 1992 ) . In particular , disagreements between group members should make group members less conﬁdent about their judgments ; on the other hand , strong agreement among mem - bers should indicate good reason to be conﬁdent about an answer . Thus , if all information as well as agree - ments and disagreements among members are shared openly and in an unbiased manner , one would expect groups to provide better - calibrated conﬁdence state - ments than individuals . This is also consistent with the explanation for overconﬁdence in individual judg - ments by Tversky and Kahneman ( 1974 ) , who attribute D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 137 . 132 . 123 . 69 ] on 27 J un e 2018 , a t 20 : 56 . F o r p e r s o n a l u s e on l y , a ll r i gh t s r e s e r v e d . Keck and Tang : Gender Composition and Conﬁdence Calibration Management Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 22 , ©2017 INFORMS 3 overconﬁdence to a process of anchoring on an ini - tial judgment and not adjusting the limits of the con - ﬁdence interval suﬃciently . Following their theory , if group members openly share their opinions and infor - mation , a group will have several judgments provided by group members to serve as anchors and thus con - ﬁdence intervals should be less susceptible to insuﬃ - cient adjustment . However , there are several important reasons why groups might not be able to take advantage of the diverse opinions and information present in the group , and thus fail to improve their conﬁdence calibration . First of all , group members are subject to the desire for social acceptance and being liked ( Deutsch 1949 , Schachter 1959 ) ; therefore , they often do not voice dis - senting opinions and judgments so as to avoid conﬂicts ( e . g . , Asch 1952 , Nemeth 1986 ) . Similarly , research on groupthink ( e . g . , Janis 1982 ) suggests that the desire to preserve harmony within a group can override the motivation to freely share information , especially when such information contradicts the opinions of other group members . Finally , even in the absence of a desire for social acceptance and group harmony , a group member might simply fail to contribute his or her pri - vate information because groups tend to focus their discussion on the information that is already available to all group members before the discussion started ( e . g . , Stasser 1992 ) . As a consequence of these processes , group judg - ments are frequently based on only a small subset of all available opinions and information that could the - oretically be shared by group members . This might be particularly harmful for conﬁdence calibration because the inﬂuence of a particular group member on group judgment is often strongly linked to his or her indi - vidual level of conﬁdence ( e . g . , Zarnoth and Sniezek 1997 ) . For example , Anderson et al . ( 2012 ) demon - strated that overconﬁdent individuals were perceived by other group members as more competent and in turn were awarded higher status and larger inﬂuence in the group . This eﬀect even held when group mem - bers learned about the overconﬁdent individual’s true competence ( Kennedy et al . 2013 ) . Therefore , when groups rely only on information and opinions pro - vided by a small subset of group members , those members with the highest degree of individual over - conﬁdence might have the most inﬂuence on group judgments and thus drive up group conﬁdence to an unwarranted level . Whereas a larger degree of opinion and informa - tion sharing is likely to cause groups to make better - calibrated conﬁdence judgments , compared to groups in which less information is shared , it is less clear whether it will also lead to more accurate judgments . In general , group deliberations have the greatest positive eﬀect on judgment accuracy for tasks with solutions that can be easily demonstrated to be correct to others once all information is available , such as mathematical prob - lems ( Laughlin and Ellis 1986 ) . In this case , a group member who knows the correct answer can persuade others , and the group will usually perform at the level of its best member or even above ( e . g . , Laughlin and Ellis 1986 , Laughlin et al . 2002 ) . However , for tasks involving estimation of unknown values in which the correct solution cannot be easily demonstrated to oth - ers , even if all available information is shared dur - ing a group discussion , group members might still not be able to take full advantage of this information and improve accuracy much beyond what would be expected from a simple statistical aggregation of indi - vidual judgments . Consistent with this logic , for these estimation tasks , studies found that group judgments with deliberations tend to be more accurate than indi - vidual judgments but only similarly accurate as a sta - tistical aggregation of those judgments ( e . g . , Gigone and Hastie 1997 , Sniezek 1990 , Tindale and Larson 1992 ) . Consequently , in our studies that focus only on estimation tasks , we do not necessarily expect a sig - niﬁcant eﬀect of opinion and information sharing on groups’ judgment accuracy . 2 . 3 . The Eﬀects of Gender Composition on Group Deliberations There is strong evidence that compared to all - male groups , the presence of female group members signif - icantly aﬀects the way group members interact with each other ( for an overview , see , e . g . , Bear and Wool - ley 2011 ) . In general , women exhibit higher levels of interpersonal sensitivity—i . e . , they pay more atten - tion and show more respect to other people’s feelings and thoughts ( Fletcher 1998 , Hall 1978 ) . Consistently , prior ﬁndings have shown that even women in lead - ership roles tend to be more focused on maintaining a positive relationship with their subordinates com - pared to male leaders ( e . g . , Eagly and Johnson 1990 ) . As a consequence of their higher interpersonal sensi - tivity , women are , for example , less likely than men to obtrusively interrupt others during group discus - sions ( e . g . , Anderson and Leaper 1998 , Smith - Lovin and Brody 1989 ) and tend to behave more coopera - tively during group tasks than men ( Kennedy 2003 ) . In line with these previous ﬁndings , compared to all - male groups , groups with female members tend to display more egalitarian behaviors , such as equal com - munication among group members and shared lead - ership ( Berdahl and Anderson 2005 , Mast 2001 ) . More - over , Woolley et al . ( 2010 ) found that a higher share of female group members made group discussions less centered on only a few dominant group mem - bers , which enabled all group members to participate more equally in the group discussion . Their results also showed that this eﬀect was strongly linked to female group members’ higher level of social sensitivity .

Keck and Tang : Gender Composition and Conﬁdence Calibration 4 Management Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 22 , ©2017 INFORMS Importantly , in addition to having a direct impact on group interactions because of their own behavior , the presence of female group members also aﬀects the way male members behave and interact with other group members ( both male and female ) . Individu - als often hold diﬀerent beliefs and expectations about what constitutes appropriate behavior when interact - ing with or in the presence of women compared to a setting involving only men ( e . g . , Williams and Polman 2015 ) . In particular , these beliefs usually involve the importance of showing more interpersonally sensitive behavior in a mixed - gender setting . For example , even today in many settings there is a normative expecta - tion for men to refrain from swearing in the presence of women . Moreover , in addition to changes in behav - ior due to normative expectations concerning polite - ness , the presence of female observers or team mem - bers has also been found to cause men to behave more generously and helpfully to other group members of both genders ( Boschini et al . 2011 , Dufwenberg and Muren 2006 , Van Vugt and Iredale 2013 ) . Studies con - ducted outside of the lab have shown similar eﬀects . For example , evidence by Williams and Polman ( 2015 ) from teams of management consultants revealed that male consultants in mixed - gender groups were more willing to act with interpersonal sensitivity in interac - tion with male clients compared to male consultants in all - male groups . Similarly , Adams and Ferreira ( 2009 ) found that female directors engaged in more group - oriented behavior by attending board meetings more regularly than men on all - male boards and , impor - tantly , that such behavior also improved the attendance record of male directors . Altogether , these ﬁndings strongly suggest that com - pared to all - male groups , the presence of women within a group causes a mental shift in all group members ( male and female ) toward more group - oriented norms . In turn , such a positive group - oriented and psycholog - ically safe atmosphere in groups promotes the shar - ing of knowledge and the expression of opinions , espe - cially when group members are in disagreement with each other ( Edmondson 1999 , Hackman 1987 , McLeod et al . 1997 ) . In particular , group members in such an environment will be less concerned that voicing dis - agreements or bringing up new pieces of information mightdamagesocialharmonyorcausethemtobenega - tively evaluated by others and therefore will focus more on sharing information and opinions . Consistent with this suggestion , interpersonally insensitive behavior such as frequent interruptions has been linked to lower information sharing ( e . g . , Cooke and Szumal 1994 ) , whereas the opposite behavior , encouraging others to voice their opinions , is associated with higher informa - tion sharing ( e . g . , Leana 1985 , Van Dyne and LePine 1998 ) . Similarly , experimental results by Greenhalgh and Chapman ( 1998 ) demonstrated that information sharing in dyadic relationships is positively corre - lated with individuals’ perceptions that the other per - son showed respect , acceptance of one’s opinions , and empathy . At the same time , perceptions that the other person displayed behavior interpreted as “being pushy or condescending” has a negative eﬀect on information sharing ( Greenhalgh and Chapman 1998 ) . In summary , we suggest that as a consequence of these above processes , the presence of female mem - bers—due to their own behavior and their impact on the behavior of male members—will cause group members to share more opinions and information with each other during the group discussion . Hypothesis 1 . Group members in groups with at least one female member are more willing to share opinions and infor - mation than those in all - male groups . Note that we did not specify the exact relationship between the degree to which group members share opinions during the group interaction and the pro - portion of female members in a group—as long as at least one female member is present . One possible conclusion one might draw from the stream of work mentioned above is that this relationship is strictly positive : group discussion norms become more group oriented as the number of women in a group increases and , consequently , all - female groups would share the most information in this regard , followed by female - majority and male - majority groups . However , as we outlined in our previous discussion , the presence of female group members tends to also shift the behavior of male group members toward higher interpersonal sensitivity . Thus , even the presence of only one female group member in a relatively small group might be suf - ﬁcient to substantially shift the degree of interperson - ally sensitive behavior to a level that is similar to that of all - female groups . In this case , we would expect to ﬁnd a diﬀerence between all - male groups and groups with at least one female member , and we expect infor - mation sharing and calibration to be relatively similar across all - female , female - majority , and male - majority groups . As a consequence of this ambiguity concern - ing the eﬀect of a higher proportion of female mem - bers , we refrain from making a prediction concerning the precise relationship between group calibration and proportion of female members . Instead , we focus on the comparison of all - male groups with groups that contain at least one female member . Because , as discussed above , sharing of opinions and information during the group discussion should have a direct positive eﬀect on groups’ conﬁdence calibra - tion , we make the following predictions concerning the eﬀect of the presence of at least one female group mem - ber on conﬁdence calibration : Hypothesis 2A . Groups with at least one female group member will make better - calibrated conﬁdence judgments than those consisting of only male members . D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 137 . 132 . 123 . 69 ] on 27 J un e 2018 , a t 20 : 56 . F o r p e r s o n a l u s e on l y , a ll r i gh t s r e s e r v e d . Keck and Tang : Gender Composition and Conﬁdence Calibration Management Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 22 , ©2017 INFORMS 5 Hypothesis 2B . Better calibration in groups with at least one female member will be mediated by a higher extent of opinion and information sharing during the group deliberation . In general , it is possible that better - calibrated judg - ments in groups with at least one female member are driven by individual diﬀerences between men and women in conﬁdence judgments . Existing research found mixed results concerning the eﬀect of gender on miscalibration among individual decision makers . For example , whereas Soll and Klayman ( 2004 ) reported that women provided wider conﬁdence intervals than men and were better calibrated , other studies did not ﬁnd an eﬀect of gender on interval widths or cali - bration ( Biais et al . 2005 , Jonsson and Allwood 2003 ) . Importantly , as outlined in the previous discussion , our theoretical predictions do not rely on individual dif - ferences in conﬁdence calibration between men and women . Instead , we suggest that independent from such a possible eﬀect , the presence of female group members will strongly aﬀect the extent to which group members share opinions and information with each other and consequently conﬁdence calibration . In addi - tion , we want to highlight that our theoretical predic - tions strongly built on prior research concerning gen - der diﬀerences in interpersonal sensitivity and thus our hypotheses refer to only the eﬀects of group gen - der compositions and not those of group diversity in other dimensions such as age or ethnicity ( e . g . , Van Knippenberg and Schippers 2007 , Van Knippenberg et al . 2004 ) . 3 . Study 1 3 . 1 . Experiment Design 3 . 1 . 1 . Methodology . We recruited 352 English - speak - ing participants ( 179 male , 173 female ; M age (cid:3) 23 years ) from a major European university via an online sign - up system . We conducted a total of 14 experimental sessions with approximately 25 participants in each session . Participants were paid a ﬁxed fee of (cid:101) 10 . The study had a between - subject design with four group conditions in which we varied group gender composi - tions : all male ( n (cid:3) 26 ) , male majority ( n (cid:3) 25 ) , female majority ( n (cid:3) 23 ) , and all female ( n (cid:3) 25 ) . 1 Participants of corresponding genders were randomly selected into each condition to form groups of three . Participants in these conditions made their judgments after an unstructured face - to - face discussion . All verbal inter - actions between the three group members were audio - taped with the explicit knowledge of the participants . In addition , we also included two individual condi - tions in which male ( n (cid:3) 28 ) and female participants ( n (cid:3) 27 ) made their judgments alone without interac - tion with other participants . 3 . 1 . 2 . Procedure . Participants were welcomed to the lab and assigned to a computer . In the individual conditions , each participant was seated in front of a computer . In the group conditions , all three group members were seated in front of the same computer . In each group , the group member whose birthday was closest to the date of the experiment was chosen to enter the group judgments into the computer . 2 Partic - ipants were not given any particular instructions on how to reach a joint group judgment . Speciﬁcally , the instructions were to “use whatever process you like to make your decisions and judgment . ” The assignment to groups was random except that we made sure that across all sessions there were approximately the same number of groups for each of the four types of group gender composition and that members of any group did not know each other before the study . After partici - pants were seated , they were asked to read the instruc - tions on their screen . Participants were also provided with paper - based versions of the instructions . We assigned two sets of items to the participants : 10 general - knowledge questions ( e . g . , Klayman et al . 1999 , Russo and Schoemaker 1992 , Soll and Klayman 2004 ) and three forecasting questions ( e . g . , Budescu and Du 2007 , Deaves et al . 2010 , Glaser et al . 2013 , Jain et al . 2013 ) . Four of those general - knowledge questions asked about distances between cities ( Berlin to Vienna , Cairo to Cape Town , Los Angeles to Tokyo , and Paris to Moscow ) , three about the weights of unknown quan - tities ( an elephant baby born recently in the Zoo of Vienna , an empty Airbus A380 , and an empty Opel Astra limousine ) , and three about the prices of prod - ucts ( an Apple laptop with a number of speciﬁc fea - tures , an economy - class air ticket from Vienna to New York booked in the next week , and a Mercedes S - Class bought in Austria in the most basic version ) . Ques - tions were presented in a random order . Participants were asked to state point estimates ( their best guesses ) as well as upper and lower bounds of 50 % , 70 % , and 90 % conﬁdence interval estimates . In the ﬁrst two forecasting questions , participants were asked to provide 90 % conﬁdence intervals for the values of the Dow Jones Index and Microsoft share prices in one month , six months , and one year . To not overburden participants , we only asked for 90 % intervals for this task . To help with their forecasts , we informed participants of the values of the Dow Jones Index and Microsoft share price at the date of the experiment . The third forecasting task adapted from Jain et al . ( 2013 ) asked participants to estimate the future value of a random variable following a random walk . In this task , we provided participants with a description of the change of a random variable over time and asked them to provide 50 % , 70 % , and 90 % conﬁdence intervals for the value of this variable after 100 periods . The initial value of the variable was zero D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 137 . 132 . 123 . 69 ] on 27 J un e 2018 , a t 20 : 56 .

Hence , the expected value of this variable is zero and its vari - ance is simply the total number of periods T (cid:3) 100 . The theoretical 50 % , 70 % , and 90 % conﬁdence intervals for this variable are , respectively , ( − 0 . 674 √ T , 0 . 674 √ T ) , ( − 1 . 036 √ T , 1 . 036 √ T ) , and ( − 1 . 645 √ T , 1 . 645 √ T ) . After ﬁnishing the 10 general - knowledge and the three forecasting questions , all participants were asked to individually ﬁll in a ﬁnal paper - based questionnaire with demographic information . In addition , partici - pants in the group conditions answered questions that aimed to assess group members’ satisfaction with their groups and the extent to which group members shared opinions and information during the discussion . At the end of the questionnaire , all participants were asked what they believed to be the purpose of the exper - iment . Only four participants correctly guessed that gender was a factor in our study . Removing these par - ticipants from the sample did not change any of our results . 3 . 1 . 3 . Measures . Based on participants’ point and in - terval estimates , we composed several measures that capture the quality of their judgments . In the follow - ing , we introduce our notations and the speciﬁc mea - sures . Let X i denote the quantity that question i asks for ( e . g . , the weight of an empty A380 or the price of Microsoft shares in six months ) . Since the participants do not know the answer for sure , X i is a random vari - able to them , and its realization , denoted as x i , stands for either the correct answer to a general - knowledge question or the actual value of a forecasted item . We let m ij denote a decision maker ( either an individual or a group ) j ’s point estimate for question i . Moreover , l ijk and u ijk denote , respectively , the lower bound and upper bound of decision maker j ’s conﬁdence interval estimate at conﬁdence level k to question i . Judgment calibration . Forthegeneral - knowledgeques - tions , we used both hit rate and calibration error to mea - sure the calibration of participants’ estimates . The hit rate for a decision maker j at conﬁdence level k was computed by counting the number of times the true value was within the conﬁdence interval across the 10 questions divided by 10 , h jk (cid:3) ( 1 / 10 ) (cid:80) 10 i (cid:3) 1 1 l ijk ≤ xi ≤ uijk , and the calibration error was calculated as the absolute diﬀerence between the hit rate and the required conﬁ - dence level , e jk (cid:3) | h jk − k | ; i (cid:3) 1 , 2 , . . . , 10 , j (cid:3) 1 , 2 , . . . , n , n being the total number of decision makers in a given condition , k = { 50 % , 70 % , 90 % } , and 1 A an indicator function that equals 1 if the condition A is satisﬁed and 0 otherwise . 3 A decision maker j is considered to be perfectly calibrated , underconﬁdent , or overcon - ﬁdent when the hit rate h jk for a given conﬁdence level k equals , is greater than , or is less than the cor - responding conﬁdence level k , respectively , and the calibration error captures the decision maker’s degree of miscalibration—the larger the calibration error , the less calibrated is the decision maker’s judgment . For the two ﬁnancial forecast questions , since we only have data for two forecasts , it is not meaningful to use the hit rate as a normative benchmark . Therefore , following the prior literature on stock - market forecasts ( e . g . , Ben - David et al . 2013 , Glaser et al . 2013 ) and consistent with the deﬁnition of overconﬁdence as an overestimation of signal precision ( e . g . , Odean 1998 ) , we derived return volatility estimates from the deci - sion makers’ conﬁdence interval estimates and then used the mean historical return volatility of the Dow Jones Index and Microsoft share price as a normative benchmark . To do that , for each item ( either the index value or the share price ) , we ﬁrst transformed deci - sion maker j ’s stated conﬁdence intervals into intervals for returns by dividing the interval’s upper and lower bounds by the corresponding item’s value on the day of the experiment : u (cid:48) j (cid:3) u j / x 0 and l (cid:48) j (cid:3) l j / x 0 . We then deduced decision maker j ’s implicit volatility estimate using the following approximation ( Pearson and Tukey 1965 , Keefer and Bodily 1983 ) : v j (cid:3) ( u (cid:48) j − l (cid:48) j ) / 3 . 25 . A deci - sion maker j is considered to be perfectly calibrated , underconﬁdent , or overconﬁdent when the estimated return volatility v j is equal to , greater than , or less than the mean historical return volatility , v 0 , which we cal - culated using stock - price data obtained from the Cen - ter for Research in Security Prices ( CRSP ) ranging from 1995 to 2015 . Judgment accuracy . Our accuracy measure for a gen - eral - knowledge question i by decision maker j is the absolute percentage error computed by taking the abso - lute diﬀerence between a point estimate and the true value , divided by the true value ( see , e . g . , Mannes et al . 2014 , Minson and Mueller 2012 , Davis - Stober et al . 2014 ) : a ij (cid:3) | m ij − x i | / x i . Conﬁdence interval width . We computed a measure of conﬁdence interval width to capture the extent to which participants appreciated uncertainty around their point estimates . The percentage interval width of question i by a decision maker j at conﬁdence level k was calculated as w ijk (cid:3) ( u ijk − l ijk ) / m ij . Opinion and information sharing . To measure the level of opinion and information sharing during the group deliberations , we asked each participant in the group conditions to rate four items adapted from Phillips and Loyd ( 2006 ) on a 1 (cid:3) “not at all” to 7 (cid:3) “very much” scale : ( i ) “Group members listened to each other’s point of view , ” ( ii ) “Group members encouraged each other to share their opinions , ” ( iii ) “Group members were interested in what theothers had to say , ” and D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 137 . 132 . 123 . 69 ] on 27 J un e 2018 , a t 20 : 56 .

We measured group mem - ber satisfaction with three items adapted from Jehn et al . ( 2010 ) on a 1 (cid:3) “not at all” to 7 (cid:3) “very much” scale : ( a ) “I was very satisﬁed working in this group during this exercise , ” ( b ) “I would like to work with this group again , ” and ( c ) “I was happy working in this group during this exercise . ” 3 . 2 . Results 3 . 2 . 1 . Results from General - Knowledge Questions . For our main measures of interest , we initially also tested for diﬀerences between judgment categories ( distances , weight , and price ) but did not ﬁnd sig - niﬁcant main eﬀects or interactions with our experi - mental conditions . Therefore , we dropped this vari - able from the analysis . We also tested for the eﬀect of diversity with respect to age and ethnicity , which together with gender have been demonstrated to be the most important dimensions of demographic diver - sity in small groups ( e . g . , Mannix and Neale 2005 , Van Knippenberg and Schippers 2007 ) . Since 93 % of our participants were white and 90 % of them were between the age of 21 and 27 ( total range : 18 – 32 ) , groups were in general very homogenous with respect to these two factors . Our analysis of age diversity or the presence of nonwhite group members indeed showed no signif - icant eﬀect on any of our dependent measures . Hence , to focus on our main results , we do not discuss these two factors further . Judgment calibration . Table 1 presents hit rates and calibration errors for the 50 % , 70 % , and 90 % conﬁdence intervals over all 10 questions across the six diﬀerent types of decision makers . Our results show that for the 50 % conﬁdence level , 30 % of decision makers exhibited underconﬁdence , 16 % were perfectly calibrated , and 55 % were overcon - ﬁdent . For the 70 % conﬁdence level , the proportions Table 1 .

Finally , for the 90 % conﬁdence level , 1 % of deci - sion makers were underconﬁdent , 7 % were perfectly calibrated , and 92 % were overconﬁdent . To analyze the eﬀect of decision - maker type on mis - calibration , we conducted a 6 ( decision - maker type ) × 3 ( conﬁdence level ) mixed ANOVA of calibration errors . The results showed a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of conﬁ - dence level , F ( 2 , 296 ) (cid:3) 81 . 82 , 4 p < 0 . 01 , a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of decision - maker type , F ( 5 , 148 ) (cid:3) 4 . 84 , p < 0 . 01 , and a signiﬁcant interaction eﬀect , F ( 10 , 296 ) (cid:3) 4 . 55 , p < 0 . 01 . Providing support for Hypothesis 2A , our follow - up analysis with planned contrasts revealed that tested jointly across all three conﬁdence levels , 5 all - male groups were signiﬁcantly worse calibrated than groups of other gender compositions , F ( 3 , 296 ) (cid:3) 11 . 68 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 56 . Tested for each probability level separately , this eﬀect was signiﬁcant for the 90 % , F ( 1 , 296 ) (cid:3) 25 . 59 , p < 0 . 01 , and 70 % conﬁdence level , F ( 1 , 296 ) (cid:3) 9 . 42 , p < 0 . 01 , but not signiﬁcant for the 50 % conﬁdence level , F ( 1 , 296 ) (cid:3) 0 . 04 , p (cid:3) 0 . 85 . Furthermore , pairwise comparisons showed that there was no sig - niﬁcant diﬀerence in calibration errors among groups with a majority of male members , a majority of female members , or female members only , p ’s > 0 . 25 . Moreover , we found that , jointly tested across all three conﬁdence levels , there was no signiﬁcant dif - ference in calibration errors between individual judg - ments by men and women , F ( 3 , 296 ) (cid:3) 1 . 40 , p (cid:3) 0 . 25 . When we tested for each conﬁdence level separately , we found a marginally signiﬁcant diﬀerence at the 90 % level , F ( 1 , 296 ) (cid:3) 3 . 32 , p (cid:3) 0 . 07 , but not at oth - ers , p ’s > 0 . 39 . Furthermore , our results showed that , tested jointly across all three conﬁdence levels , groups with at least one female member were signiﬁcantly better calibrated than male , F ( 3 , 296 ) (cid:3) 21 . 73 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 75 , or female , F ( 3 , 296 ) (cid:3) 35 . 75 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 97 , individuals ; however , whereas all - male groups were still signiﬁcantly better calibrated than female indi - viduals ( though with a smaller eﬀect size than other groups , F ( 3 , 296 ) (cid:3) 4 . 32 , p (cid:3) 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 40 ) , there was D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 137 . 132 . 123 . 69 ] on 27 J un e 2018 , a t 20 : 56 .

Keck and Tang : Gender Composition and Conﬁdence Calibration 8 Management Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 22 , ©2017 INFORMS no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between all - male groups and male individuals , F ( 3 , 296 ) (cid:3) 1 . 02 , p (cid:3) 0 . 39 . We next compared group judgments with judgments that result from a simple statistical aggregation proce - dure of judgments by three randomly determined indi - vidual decision makers . The main goal of this analysis was to explore the extent to which our results could be explained by a simple aggregation of individual judg - ments ( e . g . , Gigone and Hastie 1997 ) . In particular , it is at least theoretically possible that although we do not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant eﬀect of gender on calibration for individual judgments , the aggregation of judgments by male or female individuals might still result in a pat - tern that is similar to the one that we have observed for interacting groups . Moreover , such a comparison also has practical implications as it enables us to assess the extent to which organizations would be better or worse oﬀ by simply aggregating individual judgments—as opposed to forming a team of individuals and achiev - ing a consensus judgment through face - to - face interac - tions ( Gigone and Hastie 1997 ) . Based on prior research on the aggregation of expert judgments ( e . g . , Mannes et al . 2014 ) , we considered three diﬀerent aggregation models : aggregation by tak - ing the ( a ) mean or ( b ) median of three randomly selected individual judgements , or by ( c ) determining the top performer out of three individual decision mak - ers and implementing only the judgments of the best member . To compute calibration errors that would be expected from such an aggregation , we repeatedly and randomly sampled three individuals from the individ - ual conditions and implemented the three aggregation procedures for each sample . To implement the mean or median model , for each question , we composed the aggregated conﬁdence interval by taking the mean or median of the three lower and upper bounds stated by the three sampled individuals and then computed the calibration error based on the aggregated conﬁdence intervals over the 10 questions . To implement the best - member model , out of the three sampled individuals , we selected the individual with the lowest calibration Figure 1 .

We repeated this process 1 , 000 times ( sam - pling with replacement ) and then averaged the calibra - tion errors across the 1 , 000 trials ( see , e . g . , Gaba et al . 2017 , Hora 2004 , and Park and Budescu 2015 for a sim - ilar methodology ) . To ensure that our results are com - parable with the group estimates , we conducted this process for each gender composition separately where the gender of the three selected individuals was always consistent with the corresponding gender composition of the group . Speciﬁcally , we aggregated intervals esti - mated by ( i ) three female individuals , ( ii ) two female individualsandonemaleindividual , ( iii ) twomaleindi - viduals and one female individual , or ( iv ) three male individuals , and then compared them with those esti - mated by all - female , female - majority , male - majority , and all - male interacting groups , respectively . Figure 1 showsthecalibrationerrorsfromtheinteractinggroups and the three aggregation procedures . Most of the miscalibration in the aggregation models resulted from overconﬁdence . In particular , the pro - portion of overconﬁdent outcomes from the aggrega - tion procedure for the 50 % , 70 % , and 90 % intervals , respectively , was 52 % , 72 % , and 93 % for the mean model , 38 % , 72 % , and 95 % for the median model , and 48 % , 84 % , and 100 % for the best - member model . As Figure 1 shows , for the 70 % and 90 % conﬁ - dence levels , groups with at least one female member were better calibrated than what would be expected from a simple mean aggregation of conﬁdence inter - vals , whereas the diﬀerence was only very small for the 50 % conﬁdence level . Averaged over the three conﬁdence levels , this diﬀerence was signiﬁcant for all - female , t ( 24 ) (cid:3) 3 . 15 , p < 0 . 01 , and female - majority groups , t ( 22 ) (cid:3) 2 . 31 , p (cid:3) 0 . 03 , but not for male - majority groups , t ( 24 ) (cid:3) 0 . 65 , p (cid:3) 0 . 53 . Interestingly , calibration for all - male groups was signiﬁcantly worse than the outcome of the mean model , t ( 25 ) (cid:3) 3 . 39 , p < 0 . 01 . Similarly , we ﬁnd that all - male groups are also sig - niﬁcantly worse calibrated compared to the outcome D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 137 . 132 . 123 . 69 ] on 27 J un e 2018 , a t 20 : 56 .

For all other group types , there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the aggregation model and the group results , p ’s > 0 . 68 . Finally , comparing the group results to those from the best - member model , we again ﬁnd that all - male groups were signiﬁcantly worse calibrated than the outcome of the aggregation model , t ( 25 ) (cid:3) 2 . 98 , p (cid:3) 0 . 01 , and that there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence for any of the other group types , p ’s > 0 . 49 . Judgment accuracy and conﬁdence interval widths . There are two important factors that might aﬀect the diﬀerences in calibration errors across decision mak - ers : accuracy and interval widths . We next test the extent to which these two factors can at least par - tially account for our observed diﬀerence in calibration errors between all - male groups and other groups . 6 Table 2 presents the absolute percentage errors as well as the 50 % , 70 % , and 90 % percentage interval widths averaged over all 10 questions across the six decision - maker types . A one - way ANOVA of absolute percentage errors averaged over all 10 questions showed a signiﬁcant eﬀect of decision - maker type , F ( 5 , 148 ) (cid:3) 3 . 97 , p < 0 . 01 . Planned contrasts did not show a signiﬁcant diﬀer - ence between all - male groups and the other groups , F ( 1 , 148 ) (cid:3) 0 . 00 , p (cid:3) 0 . 98 , or between individual judg - ments by men and women , F ( 1 , 148 ) (cid:3) 1 . 36 , p (cid:3) 0 . 25 . In contrast , our results did show that groups made signiﬁcantly more accurate judgment than individuals , F ( 1 , 148 ) (cid:3) 17 . 47 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 71 . A 6 ( decision - maker type ) × 3 ( conﬁdence level ) mixed ANOVA of percentage interval widths averaged over all 10 questions revealed a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of decision - maker type , F ( 5 , 148 ) (cid:3) 3 . 04 , p (cid:3) 0 . 01 , a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of conﬁdence level , F ( 2 , 296 ) (cid:3) 509 . 05 , p < 0 . 01 , and a signiﬁcant interaction eﬀect between the two factors , F ( 10 , 296 ) (cid:3) 3 . 68 , p < 0 . 01 . Our follow up analysis with planned contrasts tested jointly across all three conﬁdence levels revealed that the percentage interval widths of all - male groups Table 2 .

For indi - vidual judgements , there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between judgments by women and men , F ( 3 , 296 ) (cid:3) 0 . 52 , p (cid:3) 0 . 69 . Finally , we found that the interval widths provided by groups with one or more female members were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those provided by female , F ( 3 , 296 ) (cid:3) 0 . 14 , p (cid:3) 0 . 94 , or male , F ( 3 , 296 ) (cid:3) 0 . 30 , p (cid:3) 0 . 83 , individuals . Mediation and group discussion . We averaged the four items measuring the degree of opinion and informa - tion sharing during the group discussion into one com - posite measure ( α (cid:3) 0 . 86 ) . 7 Interrater reliability across the three group members ( ICC [ 1 ] (cid:3) 0 . 61 ) was signif - icantly diﬀerent from zero , F ( 98 , 198 ) (cid:3) 5 . 66 , p < 0 . 01 , suggesting that group members’ ratings were strongly interdependent . Based on this result , we then further aggregated the three composite measures of the group members into one group measure ( e . g . , Kozlowski and Klein 2000 ) . A one - way ANOVA across the four gen - der compositions showed a signiﬁcant eﬀect of gender composition on the degree of opinion and information sharing in groups , F ( 3 , 95 ) (cid:3) 3 . 75 , p (cid:3) 0 . 01 . In particular , as suggested by Hypothesis 1 , all - male groups engaged signiﬁcantly less in the exchange of opinions and infor - mation than other groups , F ( 1 , 95 ) (cid:3) 10 . 53 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 74 . There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between any of the other group types , p ’s > 0 . 40 . We next tested whether the degree of opinion and information sharing during the group discussion mediated the diﬀerence in calibration errors between all - male groups and other group types , as suggested in Hypothesis 2B . Figure 2 presents the results of a mediation analysis ( Baron and Kenny 1986 ) with opin - ion and information sharing as the mediator between group gender composition ( all - male groups versus other group types ) and calibration error averaged over all three conﬁdence levels .

Our results show that sharing of opinions and infor - mation was signiﬁcantly lower for all - male groups ( path a ) than for groups with at least one female member . Furthermore , the positive eﬀect of all - male gender composition on calibration error ( path c ) was reduced—and actually became insigniﬁcant—when we controlled for opinion and information sharing in the regression ( path c and c’ ) . We next used a bootstrap procedure ( Shrout and Bolger 2002 ) with 5 , 000 trials to construct a 95 % conﬁdence interval for the indirect eﬀect of gender composition on calibration error . The conﬁdence interval ( 0 . 84 , 6 . 20 ) excluded zero , indicat - ing that our measure of opinion and information shar - ing is a signiﬁcant mediator . 3 . 2 . 2 . Results from Financial Forecasts and Random - Walk Forecasts Financial forecasts . A comparison of return volatility estimates for the Dow Jones Index and its mean his - torical return volatility ( 9 . 83 % ) , both averaged over all three time horizons , revealed that both groups ( M (cid:3) 5 . 38 % , SD (cid:3) 3 . 93 % ) , t ( 98 ) (cid:3) 11 . 18 , p < 0 . 01 , and indi - viduals ( M (cid:3) 4 . 75 % , SD (cid:3) 3 . 77 % ) , t ( 54 ) (cid:3) 9 . 93 , p < 0 . 01 , displayed overconﬁdence and signiﬁcantly underesti - mated return volatilities . For Microsoft shares 8 ( mean historical return volatility 25 . 58 % ) , we found that indi - viduals ( M (cid:3) 30 . 11 % , SD (cid:3) 17 . 09 % ) actually overesti - mated return volatilities , t ( 53 ) (cid:3) 3 . 85 , p < 0 . 01 , whereas groups ( M (cid:3) 20 . 85 % , SD (cid:3) 12 . 81 % ) underestimated return volatilities ( 256 ) , t ( 96 ) (cid:3) 1 . 95 , p (cid:3) 0 . 06 . 9 We next conducted two separate 6 ( decision - maker type ) × 3 ( time horizon ) mixed ANOVAs of return volatility estimates for the Dow Jones Index and the Microsoft share price . Our analysis for the Dow Jones Index revealed a signiﬁcant eﬀect of time hori - zon , F ( 2 , 296 ) (cid:3) 113 . 50 , p < 0 . 01 , and decision - maker type , F ( 5 , 148 ) (cid:3) 2 . 61 , p (cid:3) 0 . 03 ; the interaction between the two was marginally signiﬁcant , F ( 10 , 296 ) (cid:3) 1 . 76 , p (cid:3) 0 . 07 . Planned contrasts tested jointly across all three time horizons showed that return volatility esti - mates by all - male groups ( M (cid:3) 38 . 07 % , SD (cid:3) 29 . 70 % ) were signiﬁcantly lower than those by groups with at least one female member ( M (cid:3) 59 . 40 % , SD (cid:3) 40 . 95 % ) , F ( 3 , 296 ) (cid:3) 11 . 56 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 56 . We also found that return volatilities by groups with at least one female group member were ( marginally ) signiﬁcantly higher than those by male ( M (cid:3) 45 . 90 % , SD (cid:3) 31 . 57 % ) , F ( 3 , 296 ) (cid:3) 4 . 47 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 35 , and females ( M (cid:3) 49 . 25 % , SD (cid:3) 43 . 69 % ) , F ( 3 , 296 ) (cid:3) 2 . 50 , p (cid:3) 0 . 06 , indi - vidual . In contrast , return volatilities stated by all - male groups were marginally signiﬁcantly lower than those by female individuals , F ( 3 , 296 ) (cid:3) 2 . 35 , p (cid:3) 0 . 07 , and not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those estimated by male individuals , F ( 3 , 296 ) (cid:3) 1 . 33 , p (cid:3) 0 . 27 . There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between return volatility esti - mates by individual men and women , F ( 3 , 444 ) (cid:3) 0 . 20 , p (cid:3) 0 . 90 . Similarly , for estimated return volatilities of Micro - soft shares , the results showed a signiﬁcant eﬀect of time horizon , F ( 2 , 293 ) (cid:3) 128 . 87 , p < 0 . 01 , and of decision - maker type , F ( 5 , 148 ) (cid:3) 4 . 55 , p < 0 . 01 , but there was no signiﬁcant interaction eﬀect , F ( 10 , 293 ) (cid:3) 0 . 87 , p (cid:3) 0 . 57 . Planned contrasts tested jointly across all time horizons revealed that return volatility esti - mates by all - male groups ( M (cid:3) 14 . 07 % , SD (cid:3) 9 . 65 % ) were signiﬁcantly lower than those by other groups ( M (cid:3) 23 . 32 % , SD (cid:3) 12 . 98 % ) , F ( 3 , 293 ) (cid:3) 14 . 08 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 73 . There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between return volatility estimates by individual men ( M (cid:3) 28 . 80 % , SD (cid:3) 16 . 03 % ) and women ( M (cid:3) 31 . 53 % , SD (cid:3) 18 . 34 % ) , F ( 3 , 293 ) (cid:3) 0 . 60 , p (cid:3) 0 . 62 . Moreover , the results showed that return volatility estimates by groups with at least one female member were signiﬁcantly lower than those by female , F ( 3 , 293 ) (cid:3) 8 . 97 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 51 , or male , F ( 3 , 296 ) (cid:3) 5 . 44 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 42 , individuals . Moreover , return volatilities by all - male groups were also signiﬁcantly lower than those by male , F ( 3 , 293 ) (cid:3) 24 . 26 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 1 . 10 , or female , F ( 3 , 293 ) (cid:3) 30 . 55 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 1 . 09 , individuals . Random - walk forecasts . Similar to the ﬁnancial fore - casts , it is not meaningful to use the hit rate as a normative benchmark since we only have data for one forecast ; furthermore , unlike the Dow Jones Index D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 137 . 132 . 123 . 69 ] on 27 J un e 2018 , a t 20 : 56 .

Keck and Tang : Gender Composition and Conﬁdence Calibration Management Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 22 , ©2017 INFORMS 11 or the Microsoft share price , there is no meaningful and observable realization of the random variable . On the other hand , the random - walk model allows us to directly compute theoretical conﬁdence intervals that can be used as a benchmark ( interval width 22 . 36 averaged over the three conﬁdence levels ) . Hence , we are going to compare normative conﬁdence interval widths with those stated by decision makers to assess the susceptibility that a decision maker is prone to mis - calibration . Unlike in our previous analyses , we do not use the percentage interval width here , as the theoreti - cal expected value of the random walk equals zero . Our results showed that whereas the interval widths of groups ( M (cid:3) 25 . 87 , SD (cid:3) 21 . 21 ) was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the normatively correct value , t ( 98 ) (cid:3) 1 . 65 , p (cid:3) 0 . 10 , intervals provided by individuals ( M (cid:3) 13 . 40 , SD (cid:3) 12 . 01 ) were signiﬁcantly too narrow , t ( 54 ) (cid:3) 5 . 53 , p < 0 . 01 . A 6 ( decision - maker type ) × 3 ( conﬁdence level ) mixed ANOVA of conﬁdence interval widths revealed a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of conﬁdence level , F ( 2 , 296 ) (cid:3) 139 . 66 , p < 0 . 01 , and decision - maker type , F ( 5 , 148 ) (cid:3) 4 . 92 , p < 0 . 01 , and a signiﬁcant interaction , F ( 10 , 296 ) (cid:3) 4 . 37 , p < 0 . 01 . Conﬁdence intervals by groups were sig - niﬁcantly wider than those by individuals , F ( 3 , 296 ) (cid:3) 51 . 04 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 67 . In contrast , there was no signif - icant diﬀerence in conﬁdence interval widths between all - male groups ( M (cid:3) 25 . 69 , SD (cid:3) 16 . 62 ) and other group types ( M (cid:3) 25 . 92 , SD (cid:3) 22 . 73 ) , F ( 3 , 296 ) (cid:3) 0 . 30 , p (cid:3) 0 . 82 . 10 3 . 2 . 3 . Analysis of Audiotapes and Reported Satisfac - tion . We now turn to our analysis of the audio record - ings of group discussions and group members’ self - reported satisfaction . In the following , we focus on comparing all - male groups with other group types . Interested readers are referred to Online Appendix Table A5 for a complete summary of all measures across all four group compositions . For all of our survey - and audiotape - based measures , we also tested for diﬀerences among the other three group types but did not ﬁnd systematic signiﬁcant diﬀerences . On average , group discussions lasted for 32 minutes ( SD (cid:3) 5 . 64 ) . A one - way ANOVA indicated a signiﬁ - cant diﬀerence in the amount of discussion time across group types , F ( 3 , 95 ) (cid:3) 3 . 16 , p (cid:3) 0 . 03 , and a direct com - parison showed that discussions in all - male groups ( M (cid:3) 29 . 04 , SD (cid:3) 6 . 74 ) were signiﬁcantly shorter than those in other groups ( M (cid:3) 32 . 57 , SD (cid:3) 4 . 91 ) , F ( 1 , 95 ) (cid:3) 8 . 14 , p (cid:3) 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 65 . To analyze the extent to which discussions in all - male groups were dominated by only one or two group members , we measured the proportional amount of time each group member was speaking during the dis - cussion and used this measure as a proxy for each group member’s participation intensity ( e . g . , Phillips and Loyd 2006 , Woolley et al . 2010 , Tost et al . 2013 ) . We then computed the variance of group member par - ticipation intensity across the three group members ( e . g . , Woolley et al . 2010 ) . The participation variance would equal zero when all group members partici - pated equally in the discussion and reach its maximum when only one group member spoke and the remain - ing two members remained completely silent . A one - way ANOVA revealed a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the participation variance across groups of diﬀerent gen - der compositions , F ( 3 , 95 ) (cid:3) 2 . 87 , p (cid:3) 0 . 04 . In addition , our analysis showed that the variance in group mem - bers’ participation intensity during the discussion was signiﬁcantly larger in all - male groups ( M (cid:3) 0 . 046 , SD (cid:3) 0 . 033 ) than in all other groups ( M (cid:3) 0 . 029 , SD (cid:3) 0 . 031 ) , F ( 1 , 95 ) (cid:3) 7 . 50 , p (cid:3) 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 63 . To analyze participants’ satisfaction with their groups , for each group , we aggregated the three self - reported measures of group member satisfaction into one composite variable ( α (cid:3) 0 . 81 ) and computed the group average . A one - way ANOVA indicated a sig - niﬁcant diﬀerence across group gender compositions , F ( 3 , 95 ) (cid:3) 2 . 80 , p (cid:3) 0 . 04 . Moreover , planned contrasts revealed that group members in all - male groups ( M (cid:3) 4 . 34 , SD (cid:3) 0 . 61 ) were less satisﬁed than those in groups with at least one female member ( M (cid:3) 4 . 75 , SD (cid:3) 0 . 79 ) , F ( 1 , 95 ) (cid:3) 5 . 69 , p (cid:3) 0 . 02 , d (cid:3) 0 . 54 . Summary . Supporting Hypothesis 2A , for both gen - eral - knowledge questions and ﬁnancial forecasts , we found that all - male groups were signiﬁcantly worse calibrated than groups of other gender compositions . In contrast , there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in cal - ibration errors among male - majority , female - majority , or all - female groups . We further found that this diﬀer - ence between all - male groups and other group types was not driven by individual diﬀerences , nor can it be explained by a simple aggregation of individual judg - ments . Rather , supporting Hypotheses 1 and 2B , diﬀer - ences in calibration errors were driven by lower infor - mation sharing in all - male groups . Consistently , our analysis of the recorded group discussions showed that in all - male groups , group interactions were shorter and characterized by more unequal participation patterns . 4 . Study 2 Study 2 had a very similar procedure and design as in Study 1 . In particular , we employed the same six between - subject conditions : four group conditions with varying gender compositions and two individ - ual conditions with male or female participants . The main goal of the new study was to replicate our previous ﬁndings with higher statistical power than before 11 and to address several drawbacks and limita - tions of Study 1 . In particular , in Study 1 , we chose the 10 general - knowledge questions arbitrarily from items used in previous research . Although this is a common D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 137 . 132 . 123 . 69 ] on 27 J un e 2018 , a t 20 : 56 .

Keck and Tang : Gender Composition and Conﬁdence Calibration 12 Management Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 22 , ©2017 INFORMS approach to assessing overconﬁdence , other work has argued that overconﬁdence in general might at least partially be an artifact of a biased question - selection procedure ( e . g . , Gigerenzer et al . 1991 , Juslin et al . 2000 ) . To avoid this potential problem , we now focused on only two speciﬁc knowledge domains with which our participants are generally familiar , and within these two domains , we randomly selected questions to compose a representative question set ( Gigerenzer et al . 1991 ) . Moreover , one other limitation of Study 1 was that participants’ compensation was not explic - itly linked to their performance in the actual task . This could in principle aﬀect our results ; for exam - ple , prior ﬁndings suggest that women react diﬀerently to competitive ﬁnancial incentives than men ( Gneezy et al . 2003 ) . Although our tasks are not competi - tive in nature , and thus there is no direct reason to assume that ﬁnancial incentives should interact with our manipulation , testing for the robustness of our re - sults when ﬁnancial incentives are used is nevertheless desirable . Therefore , in Study 2 , we employed an incen - tive scheme adapted from Jose and Winkler ( 2009 ) that incentivizes participants to report carefully considered intervals . Finally , we introduced two additional new measures that directly measure interpersonally sensi - tive behavior by male and female group members dur - ing the group discussion . 4 . 1 . Experimental Design 4 . 1 . 1 . Methodology and Procedure . Study 2 followed the same general procedure as Study 1 . We recruited 494 ( 249 male , 245 female ; M age (cid:3) 24 years ) English - speaking students from a large Austrian university . Participants received on average (cid:101) 12 for their partic - ipation . In total , we conducted 17 experimental ses - sions with approximately 25 participants in each ses - sion ; each session lasted approximately 50 minutes . Similar to Study 1 , participants were assigned to either the two individual conditions ( 33 female 12 and 34 male participants ) or one of the four group conditions : all male ( n (cid:3) 36 ) , male majority ( n (cid:3) 36 ) , female majority ( n (cid:3) 35 ) , and all female ( n (cid:3) 35 ) . For the 10 general - knowledge questions , participants were asked to pro - vide point estimates as well as upper and lower bounds of 50 % , 70 % , and 90 % conﬁdence intervals . We selected the 10 general - knowledge questions randomly from two knowledge domains that are at least moderately familiar to our participants . 13 In particular , we cre - ated ﬁve questions each from the random selection of ( a ) ﬁve pairs of European Union capitals ( out of 378 possible pairs ) and ( b ) ﬁve electronic products from the university’s online shop ( out of 63 total items ) . The 10 selected questions were the distances between ( a1 ) Soﬁa and Madrid , ( a2 ) Valletta and Stockholm , ( a3 ) Riga and Ljubljana , ( a4 ) Valletta and Dublin , and ( a5 ) Rome and Helsinki , and the prices of ( b1 ) an Apple iPad Air 2 , ( b2 ) a Lenovo ThinkPad , ( b3 ) an Apple Mac - Book Air , ( b4 ) a Microsoft Surface Book , and ( b5 ) a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga . Participants were informed about the corresponding countries of the given cities and about the technical features of the given electronic products that were listed on the university shop’s web - site . In the ﬁnancial forecasting questions , participants were asked to provide point estimates as well as 90 % conﬁdence intervals for the value of the German stock market index ( DAX ) in 1 , 6 , and 12 months’ time . 14 To encourage participants to consider their answers carefully , we employed an incentive scheme adapted from Jose and Winkler ( 2009 ) . In particular participants were informed that , in addition to a ﬁxed fee of (cid:101) 8 , their ﬁnal payoﬀ would depend on the quality of their judg - ments , with up to 6 (cid:101) of additional compensation . They then received a careful explanation of the precise pro - cedure from which their payoﬀs would be calculated , with an emphasized highlight that their ﬁnancial pay - oﬀs are maximized when they put eﬀort into the task and state estimates that best reﬂect their actual beliefs ( see Jose and Winkler 2009 for a detailed description of the incentive scheme ) . 4 . 1 . 2 . Measures . We employed the same measures as in Study 1 to analyze hit rate , calibration error , abso - lute percentage error , percentage interval width for general - knowledge questions , return volatility estimate for ﬁnan - cial forecasts and opinion and information sharing , and discussion length , participation variance , group member satisfaction for group discussions . In addition , we in - cluded two new measures : interruption and encourage - ment to participate . Frequent interruptions are a sign of interpersonally insensitive behavior and an indica - tor of dysfunctional communication patterns that is likely to decrease information sharing ( e . g . , Cooke and Szumal 1994 ) . Contrarily , encouraging others to speak is an example of interpersonally sensitive behavior that might increase the exchange of information ( Leana 1985 , Van Dyne and LePine 1998 ) . Speciﬁcally , on com - pletion of the main tasks , participants were asked to rate two types of behaviors by each of the other two group members on a scale from 1 (cid:3) “not at all” to 7 (cid:3) “very much” : ( a ) “to what extent were you interrupted by this group member during the group discussion ? ” and ( b ) “to what extent did this group member encour - age you to participate in the group discussion ? ” . 4 . 2 . Results Like in Study 1 , we initially also tested for eﬀects of knowledge domains ( distances and prices ) and of group age and ethnicity composition . Again , we did not ﬁnd a systematic inﬂuence of these factors on our main measures of interest . Groups were again quite homogenous with respect to age and ethnicity : the age range was 18 – 28 , and 89 % of all group members iden - tiﬁed themselves as white .

Results from General - Knowledge Questions Judgment calibration . Table 3 presents hit rates and calibration errors for the 50 % , 70 % , and 90 % conﬁdence intervals averaged over all 10 questions across the six types of decision makers . As shown in Table 3 , we ﬁnd overconﬁdence across all decision - maker types and conﬁdence levels . For the 50 % ( resp . , 70 % , 90 % ) conﬁdence level , 10 % ( resp . , 4 % , 1 % ) of decision makers are underconﬁdent , 11 % ( resp . , 8 % , 3 % ) perfectly calibrated , and 79 % ( resp . , 88 % and 97 % ) overconﬁdent . The results of a 6 ( decision - maker type ) × 3 ( con - ﬁdence level ) mixed ANOVA of calibration errors re - vealed a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of conﬁdence level , F ( 2 , 406 ) (cid:3) 73 . 46 , p < 0 . 01 , and decision - maker type , F ( 5 , 203 ) (cid:3) 5 . 12 , p < 0 . 01 , but no signiﬁcant inter - action eﬀect is observed , F ( 10 , 406 ) (cid:3) 0 . 45 , p (cid:3) 0 . 92 . Lending support to Hypothesis 2A , a planned con - trast tested jointly across all three conﬁdence levels showed that the calibration of all - male groups was sig - niﬁcantly worse than that of other groups , F ( 3 , 406 ) (cid:3) 25 . 91 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 80 .

In contrast , we found that groups with at least one female member were sig - niﬁcantly better calibrated than female , F ( 3 , 406 ) (cid:3) 25 . 14 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 78 , or male , F ( 3 , 406 ) (cid:3) 13 . 72 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 55 , individuals .

A comparison with the best - member model revealed signiﬁcant diﬀerences for male - majority groups , t ( 35 ) (cid:3) 2 . 25 , p (cid:3) 0 . 03 , and female - majority groups , t ( 34 ) (cid:3) 2 . 61 , p (cid:3) 0 . 01 , but not for all - female groups , t ( 34 ) (cid:3) 0 . 66 , p (cid:3) 0 . 52 . Impor - tantly , all - male groups were still signiﬁcantly worse calibrated than the outcome of the mean , t ( 35 ) (cid:3) 5 . 96 , p < 0 . 01 , the median , t ( 35 ) (cid:3) 5 . 66 , p < 0 . 01 , or the best - member t ( 35 ) (cid:3) 8 . 20 , p < 0 . 01 , model . Judgment accuracy and conﬁdence interval widths . Table 4 presents the absolute percentage errors as well as percentage interval widths aggregated over all 10 questions across the six decision - maker types for the 50 % , 70 % , and 90 % conﬁdence levels . A one - way ANOVA of absolute percentage errors averaged over all 10 questions revealed a signiﬁcant eﬀect of decision - maker type , F ( 5 , 203 ) (cid:3) 3 . 96 , p < 0 . 01 . Planned contrasts did not show a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in accuracy between all - male groups and the other groups , F ( 1 , 203 ) (cid:3) 0 . 80 , p (cid:3) 0 . 37 . In contrast , a com - parison of groups and individuals showed that group judgments were signiﬁcantly more accurate than those of individuals , F ( 1 , 203 ) (cid:3) 15 . 87 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 59 , but there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between individual judgments made by men and women , F ( 1 , 203 ) (cid:3) 2 . 48 , p (cid:3) 0 . 12 . A 6 ( decision - maker type ) × 3 ( conﬁdence level ) mixed ANOVA of percentage interval widths averaged over the 10 questions showed a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of both decision - maker type , F ( 5 , 406 ) (cid:3) 3 . 75 , p < 0 . 01 , and conﬁdence level , F ( 2 , 406 ) (cid:3) 575 . 80 , p < 0 . 01 , but no signiﬁcant interaction was observed , F ( 10 , 406 ) (cid:3) 1 . 17 , p (cid:3) 0 . 31 . Joint tests across all three conﬁdence levels with planned contrasts revealed that conﬁdence intervals by all - male groups were signiﬁcantly nar - rower than those of other groups , F ( 3 , 406 ) (cid:3) 19 . 25 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 71 . Moreover , our analysis showed that there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in interval widths between individual judgments by men and women , F ( 3 , 406 ) (cid:3) 1 . 98 , p (cid:3) 0 . 12 . In addition , intervals pro - vided by groups with at least one female member were signiﬁcantly narrower than those provided by female individuals , F ( 3 , 406 ) (cid:3) 4 . 77 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 31 , but not compared to those provided by male individuals , F ( 3 , 406 ) (cid:3) 0 . 34 , p (cid:3) 0 . 80 . Intervals provided by all - male groups were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those stated by male , F ( 3 , 406 ) (cid:3) 15 . 05 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 67 , or female , F ( 3 , 406 ) (cid:3) 27 . 73 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 89 , individuals . Mediation and group discussion . For each group member , we averaged the four items measuring the degree of opinion and information sharing into one composite measure ( α (cid:3) 0 . 88 ) and then averaged the three group members’ ratings into one aggregate measure for each group ( ICC [ 1 ] (cid:3) 0 . 55 , F [ 132 , 266 ] (cid:3) 4 . 67 , p < 0 . 01 ) . 15 The results of a one - way ANOVA across group types revealed a signiﬁcant main eﬀect , F ( 3 , 129 ) (cid:3) 4 . 30 , p (cid:3) 0 . 01 . Moreover , as predicted in Hypothesis 1 , the results of a planned contrast indicate that members of all - male groups shared less informa - tion with each other than members of other groups , F ( 1 , 129 ) (cid:3) 12 . 09 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 70 . Our results did not show a signiﬁcant diﬀerence among other group types , p ’s > 0 . 42 . We next tested whether diﬀerences in calibration errors between all - male and other groups were medi - ated by the degree of opinion and information sharing . The results are shown in Figure 4 . Consistent with Hypothesis 1 , our results revealed that the sharing of opinions and information was sig - niﬁcantly lower in all - male groups ( path a ) than in other groups . Furthermore , the negative eﬀect of hav - ing only male group members on calibration ( path c ) was reduced and became insigniﬁcant when we controlled for opinion and information sharing in the regression ( path c and c’ ) . Moreover , the 95 % boot - strapped conﬁdence interval for the mediated eﬀect ( 2 . 27 , 8 . 46 ) excluded zero , indicating signiﬁcant medi - ation as predicted in Hypothesis 2B . 4 . 2 . 2 .

The results of a 6 ( decision - maker type ) × 3 ( time horizon ) mixed ANOVA of return volatility esti - mates showed a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of time horizon , F ( 2 , 406 ) (cid:3) 391 . 34 , p < 0 . 01 , but not of decision - maker type , F ( 5 , 406 ) (cid:3) 1 . 04 , p (cid:3) 0 . 40 , and there was no signif - icant interaction between the two factors , F ( 10 , 406 ) (cid:3) 0 . 47 , p (cid:3) 0 . 91 . However , planned contrasts conducted jointly across all three time horizons indicated that return volatility estimates by all - male groups were signiﬁcantly lower ( M (cid:3) 5 . 14 % , SD (cid:3) 2 . 46 % ) than those by other group types ( M (cid:3) 6 . 21 % , SD (cid:3) 3 . 20 % ) , F ( 3 , 406 ) (cid:3) 3 . 98 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 35 . There was no sig - niﬁcant diﬀerence between individual judgments by men ( M (cid:3) 6 . 59 % , SD (cid:3) 3 . 42 % ) and women ( M (cid:3) 6 . 64 % , SD (cid:3) 3 . 95 % ) , F ( 3 , 406 ) (cid:3) 0 . 20 , p (cid:3) 0 . 90 . Similarly , there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between groups with at least one female member and male , F ( 3 , 406 ) (cid:3) 0 . 52 , p (cid:3) 0 . 67 , or female , F ( 3 , 406 ) (cid:3) 1 . 05 , p (cid:3) 0 . 37 , individu - als . In contrast , return volatility estimates by all - male groups were signiﬁcantly lower than those by either male , F ( 3 , 406 ) (cid:3) 4 . 81 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 49 , or female , F ( 3 , 406 ) (cid:3) 5 . 30 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 46 , individuals . 4 . 2 . 3 . Analysis of Audiotapes , Reported Satisfac - tion , and Perceived Interpersonal Sensitivity . Like in Study 1 , in the following we focus on comparing all - male groups with other groups . A complete summary of all measures across the four group compositions is provided in Online Appendix Table A9 . For all mea - sures , we also tested for diﬀerences among the other three group types but found no systematic signiﬁcant diﬀerences . Group discussions lasted for 24 minutes on aver - age ( SD (cid:3) 6 . 88 ) . Although a one - way ANOVA did not indicate a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in discussion length across diﬀerent group types , F ( 3 , 138 ) (cid:3) 2 . 01 , p (cid:3) 0 . 12 , a planned contrast showed that discussions in all - male groups ( M (cid:3) 22 . 82 , SD (cid:3) 5 . 65 ) took marginally signiﬁ - cantly less time than those in other groups ( M (cid:3) 25 . 01 , SD (cid:3) 7 . 00 ) , F ( 1 , 138 ) (cid:3) 3 . 39 , p (cid:3) 0 . 07 , d (cid:3) 0 . 35 . Using the same procedure as described in Study 1 , we next computed the variance of group member participa - tion intensity that captures how evenly group mem - bers participated in the discussion . A one - way ANOVA revealed a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the participation variance across groups of diﬀerent gender composi - tion , F ( 3 , 138 ) (cid:3) 3 . 10 , p (cid:3) 0 . 03 , and our follow - up anal - ysis showed that the participation variance during the discussion was signiﬁcantly larger in all - male groups ( M (cid:3) 0 . 036 , SD (cid:3) 0 . 028 ) than in other groups ( M (cid:3) 0 . 023 , SD (cid:3) 0 . 026 ) , F ( 1 , 138 ) (cid:3) 6 . 90 , p (cid:3) 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 50 . We next aggregated our three group member sat - isfaction items into one composite variable ( α (cid:3) 0 . 83 ) . A one - way ANOVA of average member satisfaction in each group revealed a signiﬁcant diﬀerence across gen - der composition , F ( 1 , 129 ) (cid:3) 3 . 80 , p (cid:3) 0 . 01 , and planned contrasts revealed that group members in all - male groups ( M (cid:3) 3 . 98 , SD (cid:3) 0 . 66 ) were signiﬁcantly less sat - isﬁed than those in groups with at least one female member ( M (cid:3) 4 . 35 , SD (cid:3) 0 . 65 ) , F ( 1 , 129 ) (cid:3) 8 . 18 , p (cid:3) 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 56 . A one - way ANOVA across group types of the aver - age group scores for our two measures of interperson - ally ( in ) sensitive behavior , interruption and encourage - ment to participate , revealed a marginally signiﬁcant main eﬀect of group types for encouragement to par - ticipate , F ( 3 , 129 ) (cid:3) 2 . 55 , p (cid:3) 0 . 06 , and interruption , F ( 3 , 129 ) (cid:3) 2 . 40 , p (cid:3) 0 . 07 . Planned contrasts revealed that there were signiﬁcantly more perceived interrup - tions in all - male groups ( M (cid:3) 3 . 26 , SD (cid:3) 0 . 71 ) than in other groups ( M (cid:3) 2 . 91 , SD (cid:3) 0 . 81 ) , F ( 1 , 129 ) (cid:3) 5 . 27 , p (cid:3) 0 . 02 , d (cid:3) 0 . 46 , and that there were signiﬁcantly more perceived encouragements to speak in groups with at least one female member ( M (cid:3) 3 . 59 , SD (cid:3) 1 . 08 ) than in all - male groups ( M (cid:3) 3 . 13 , SD (cid:3) 0 . 83 ) , F ( 3 , 129 ) (cid:3) 5 . 27 , p (cid:3) 0 . 02 , d (cid:3) 0 . 45 . We next analyzed our data from mixed - gender groups on an individual level with a 2 ( rater gender ) × 2 D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 137 . 132 . 123 . 69 ] on 27 J un e 2018 , a t 20 : 56 .

We also did not ﬁnd an eﬀect of rater gender or any signiﬁcant interaction eﬀects , p ’s > 0 . 10 . Moreover , our results showed that men in mixed - gender groups were rated by their group members to be interrupting others less often , F ( 1 , 402 ) (cid:3) 6 . 14 , p (cid:3) 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 25 , and encouraging others to speak more than men in all - male groups , F ( 1 , 402 ) (cid:3) 10 . 09 , p < 0 . 01 , d (cid:3) 0 . 32 . Finally , our analysis showed that the level of perceived interpersonally sensitive behaviors by men in mixed - gender groups were similar to that of women in all - female groups for encouragements to speak , F ( 1 , 396 ) (cid:3) 0 . 37 , p (cid:3) 0 . 54 , and for interruptions , F ( 1 , 396 ) (cid:3) 0 . 57 , p (cid:3) 0 . 45 . Together , these ﬁndings indi - cate that , consistent with our theoretical framework , men display more interpersonally sensitive behavior in the presence of women than when they are interacting in all - male groups . Summary . We found similar results as in Study 1 with respect to calibration errors and the mediating role of information sharing , providing overall supporting evi - dence to all our hypotheses . Contributing a number of additional insights , we also found that there were sig - niﬁcantly more perceived interruptions and less per - ceived encouragements to speak in all - male groups than other group types . Moreover , male members in mixed - gender groups showed similar levels of inter - personal sensitivity as female group members , and higher levels of interpersonal sensitivity than men in all - male groups . 5 . General Discussion The results of two laboratory experiments revealed that conﬁdence judgments by groups with at least one female member were signiﬁcantly better calibrated than those by all - male groups . This eﬀect was medi - ated by a higher degree of opinion and information sharing in groups with one or more female members . Consistently , our analysis of the audiotaped group dis - cussion also established that in groups with at least one female member , group members participated more evenly in group discussions than those in all - male groups where discussions ended more quickly and were more likely to be dominated by a single member . In addition , our results in Study 2 revealed that group members in all - male groups were more likely to inter - rupt others and less likely to encourage others to par - ticipate than members in other groups . On the other hand , among groups with at least one female mem - ber , there was no diﬀerence in calibration , information sharing , or other group discussion measures . In both studies , we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant dif - ference in conﬁdence calibration between judgments made by individual men and women , which is in line with some prior research ( Biais et al . 2005 , Jonsson and Allwood 2003 ) but diﬀerent from others ( Soll and Klayman 2004 ) . Moreover , our results showed that con - ﬁdence calibration in groups with at least one female member was generally at the same level or even better than what would be expected from a simple aggre - gation of individual judgments of the corresponding gender composition , but this did not hold for all - male groups whose calibration was actually worse than what would be expected from a statistical aggrega - tion . Therefore , our results indicate that whereas group deliberation had either neutral or positive eﬀects for groups with at least one female member , it was clearly detrimental for all - male groups . We suggest that this latter eﬀect might be due to a lack of eﬃcient shar - ing of divergent opinions and information during the group deliberation in all - male groups , which caused groups to set overly narrow conﬁdence intervals . Due to this process , all - male groups might generally per - form closer to the level of individual decision mak - ers with respect to their conﬁdence calibration than groups of other gender compositions where divergent opinions were more likely to be shared . In general , our results from the mediation analysis , the statistical aggregation models , and the compari - son of individual judgments by men and women all strongly indicate that , as we hypothesized , it is the group deliberation process , rather than group mem - bers’ individual diﬀerences , that drives the diﬀerence in calibration between groups with at least one female member and all - male groups . Consistent with the results from prior research ( Plous 1995 , Russo and Schoemaker 1992 , Sniezek and Henry 1989 ) , a direct comparison of group and indi - vidual judgments showed that groups with at least one female member on average tended to make sig - niﬁcantly better calibrated judgments than individu - als . However , this advantage of group decision mak - ing was mostly lost in the case of all - male groups . For men—when interacting in an all - male group—group discussions have a nonsigniﬁcant eﬀect on calibration or even harm calibration compared to a simple aggre - gation of individual judgments . Both accuracy and interval widths are factors that might be aﬀecting calibration . Whereas we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant eﬀect of groups’ gender composition on judgment accuracy , conﬁdence intervals set by all - male groups were signiﬁcantly narrower than those set by other groups . Thus , whereas group gender composi - tion did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence a group’s ability D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 137 . 132 . 123 . 69 ] on 27 J un e 2018 , a t 20 : 56 .

Keck and Tang : Gender Composition and Conﬁdence Calibration Management Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 22 , ©2017 INFORMS 17 to correctly answer a particular question , our results indicate that it did have a strong eﬀect on group mem - bers’ appreciation of their own lack of knowledge . In particular , whereas all groups tend to be more accu - rate than individuals , this advantage is mostly oﬀset in all - male groups by narrower conﬁdence intervals , which is consistent with our theoretical predictions that compared with members in other groups , mem - bers in all - male groups are less aware of their limited knowledge because of a lack of information sharing . Suggesting that our main ﬁndings are quite robust , we obtained consistent results with ﬂat incentives in Study 1 and when participants’ incentives were par - ticularly linked to their answers in Study 2 . Moreover , we found similar results with items that were simply adapted from prior work or were randomly sampled from two knowledge domains with which participants were relatively familiar . Results from ﬁnancial forecasts in both studies mir - rored those from general - knowledge questions , pro - viding converging evidence for our hypotheses from a diﬀerent type of task . All - male groups provided conﬁ - dence intervals that implied signiﬁcantly lower return volatility in the stock market than those provided by groups with at least one female member . More - over , whereas return volatility estimates by all groups were generally lower than those observed historically , volatility estimates by groups with only male mem - bers were even further away from historical volatilities . These ﬁndings also suggest that the detrimental eﬀect resulting from the absence of female group members extends to tasks that are similar to those carried out within the ﬁnance industry—an area with a relatively high proportion of all - male groups . In contrast to our results from the general - knowl - edge and ﬁnancial forecast questions , in Study 1 , we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between all - male groups and other group types for estimates in the random - walk task , which provides an interesting boundary condition for the eﬀects of group gender composition . An explanation for this outcome might be that , unlike the general - knowledge and ﬁnancial forecast questions , this particular task requires mostly mathematical intuition and does not relate to real - world phenomena ; therefore , even if group members strongly engage in the exchange of opinions and infor - mation , their lack of skill in a task might prevent them from taking advantage of this increase in available information ( e . g . , Woolley et al . 2010 ) . Our work makes several contributions . First , where - as prior research on overconﬁdence in groups ( Plous 1995 , Russo and Schoemaker 1992 , Sniezek and Henry 1989 ) was limited to a direct comparison of individ - ual and group judgments , we focus on the compari - son between all - male groups and groups with at least one female member . In doing so , our study establishes gender composition as an important moderating factor that determines the extent to which group discussions can alleviate miscalibration in conﬁdence judgments . In particular , our ﬁndings reveal that group delibera - tions have a neutral or positive eﬀect on calibration for groups with one or more female members but actually harm calibration in all - male groups compared to a sim - ple aggregation of individual judgments . In addition , our study also extends prior work on group conﬁdence calibration to the area of ﬁnancial forecasts . Our results from this domain suggest that our ﬁndings also have important practical implications . In particular , organi - zations in the ﬁnancial sector that rely on such forecasts could attempt to improve the quality of their forecasts by adjusting their human resource practices to ensure that relatively small groups of analysts contain at least one female member . Second , our study contributes to the literature on gender diversity in organizations . In particular , our ﬁndings demonstrate that the beneﬁts arising from the presence of female group members could be more sub - tle than an increase in group performance—they might instead at least partially be driven by a lower suscep - tibility to judgmental biases such as overconﬁdence . In recent years , academic research , public media , and politics has paid considerable attention to the gender composition of top management teams and board of directors . Even though a higher share of women on boards and in top management teams is often con - sidered desirable in the interest of gender equality , there have been mixed ﬁndings on its actual impact on ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial performance ( e . g . , Post and Byron 2015 , Wolfers 2006 ) . Our results suggest that one impor - tant advantage of avoiding all - male groups might be the increased ability to better deal with situations under substantial levels of uncertainty due to better conﬁdence calibration . Such advantage might not be directly visible in ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial performance ( which is also inﬂuenced by a large variety of other factors ) but is crucial in keeping ﬁrms away from excessive risk , and hence away from the danger of bankruptcy ( e . g . , Ben - David et al . 2013 ) . Moreover , whereas prior work has demonstrated the eﬀect of gender diversity on boards and in top management teams on organi - zational outcomes such as ﬁnancial performance ( Post and Byron 2015 ) , risk taking ( Baixauli - Soler et al . 2015 ) , and ﬁnancial fraud ( Cumming et al . 2015 ) , little is known about the actual group processes that are driv - ing these eﬀects . By linking group gender composition to information sharing and the quality of group conﬁ - dence judgments , our work provides insights into this “black box” and thus complements prior research in this area . Third , our work adds further evidence to the exten - sive literature on the psychological processes trig - gered by group diversity ( e . g . , Mannix and Neale 2005 , D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 137 . 132 . 123 . 69 ] on 27 J un e 2018 , a t 20 : 56 .

Keck and Tang : Gender Composition and Conﬁdence Calibration 18 Management Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 22 , ©2017 INFORMS Van Knippenberg and Schippers 2007 ) . In particular , our ﬁndings concerning the beneﬁcial eﬀects of gen - der diversity on opinion and information sharing are in line with prior theoretical frameworks suggesting that the eﬀects of group diversity do not predomi - nantly derive from additional members’ knowledge or skills , but rather from their impact on within - group processes such as information sharing and elabora - tion ( e . g . , Van Knippenberg and Schippers 2007 , Van Knippenberg et al . 2004 ) . It is , however , important to note that since our experimental evidence focuses speciﬁcally on the eﬀects arising from the presence of women during group interactions and on the role of interpersonal sensitivity in changing the quality of group discussions , it is unclear the extent to which our ﬁndings might extend to other forms of diversity , such as demographic ( e . g . , ethnicity and age ) , functional , or educational diversity that have been extensively stud - ied in the prior literature and have also been hypoth - esized to have similar eﬀects on information process - ing ( e . g . , Van Knippenberg and Schippers 2007 , Van Knippenberg et al . 2004 ) . We also diﬀer from this pre - vious work in that we do not focus on exploring dif - ferences between diverse and homogenous groups , but instead mainly compare all - male groups and groups with at least one female member—including the case of homogenously female groups . Related to this issue , previous literature in this area has also frequently pointed out that group diversity might in many cases lead to social categorization pro - cesses and fault lines within a group ( e . g . , Mannix and Neale 2005 , Van Knippenberg and Schippers 2007 ) , and could thus have a negative impact on perfor - mance and group member satisfaction . In contrast , our results showed little evidence for the presence of such a process that could potentially harm information sharing among group members . Moreover , we found that members of all - male groups actually displayed the lowest willingness to work with the other group mem - bers again . It would be an important topic for future research to identify the precise conditions under which gender diversity leads to problematic social categoriza - tion processes or lower group satisfaction . Our ﬁndings also establish an interesting discontinu - ity in the eﬀects of gender composition : whereas com - pared to groups with at least one female member , all - male groups were signiﬁcantly worse calibrated and showed less opinion and information sharing during the group discussion , there was no signiﬁcant diﬀer - ence in calibration or the extent of information shar - ing among all - female , female - majority , or male - major - ity groups . This is consistent with prior ﬁndings that female group members shape the nature of group dis - cussions not only through their own behavior but also by aﬀecting the behavior of male group members ( e . g . , Adams and Ferreira 2009 , Williams and Polman 2015 ) . Therefore , in a relatively small group as in our study , even the presence of just one woman in the group appears to be suﬃcient to derive all potential beneﬁts . Our work has several limitations . First , we focused only on small groups of three members ; hence , our ﬁndings might not directly extend to larger groups . For example , according to prior work on minority status ( e . g . , Kanter 1977a , b ) , when minority members con - stitute less than 20 % of the group , they are likely to be marginalized by other group members ; thus , there might not be a positive eﬀect on group outcomes aris - ing from the presence of minorities . Moreover , social impact theory ( Latane 1981 ) suggests that even in the absence of external marginalization from the majority group members , minority group members might still not be able to change the group dynamics if their num - ber is too small compared to the total group size . These suggestions are also consistent with prior research on the eﬀects of women on boards of directors , which has shown that even though the presence of only one woman might already be beneﬁcial ( e . g . , Joecks et al . 2013 , Zaichkowsky 2014 ) , female board participation will only make its full contribution when the pro - portion of women reaches a certain “critical mass , ” which is often thought to be around 30 % . In our study , except for all - male groups , women always comprised at least 33 % of the entire group ; thus , this threshold was always met . Given these prior ﬁndings , it would clearly be important to generalize our current ﬁnd - ings to settings with larger groups and explore the inﬂuence of the required critical mass threshold in an experimental setting . Studying larger groups would also help to increase the external validity of our ﬁnd - ings as managerial decisions are often made in groups with more than three members that , even independent from their gender composition , might exhibit diﬀerent group norms than smaller groups . 17 Another limitation of our study is that we only focused on a particular type of overconﬁdence . Future research should explore the eﬀect of gender composi - tion on other forms of overconﬁdence or other com - mon cognitive biases , such as the escalation of com - mitment or the conﬁrmation bias . Prior studies that have compared individuals and groups with respect to cognitive biases have reported very mixed results ( e . g . , Kerr et al . 1996 ) . Our ﬁndings in this paper suggest that group gender composition might be an impor - tant moderating factor that could explain the circum - stances under which groups deal with cognitive biases better than individuals . Similarly , it would be inter - esting to explore the eﬀect of group gender composi - tion on outcomes for of individual group members— for example , in the form of knowledge transfers from group discussions to subsequent individual judgments ( e . g . , Maciejovsky and Budescu 2007 , Maciejovsky et al . 2013 ) or attitudes toward outgroups ( e . g . , Keck 2014 ) .

In line with our theory , our ﬁndings indicate that members in groups with at least one female mem - ber showed higher levels of interpersonal sensitivity in group interactions such as fewer interruptions and more encouragements , both of which are associated with higher information sharing ( Cooke and Szumal 1994 , Leana 1985 , Van Dyne and LePine 1998 ) . How - ever , there could theoretically still be factors other than the heightened interpersonal sensitivity that con - tribute to higher information sharing . First of all , as suggested by prior ﬁndings on sexual selection mech - anisms ( e . g . , Griskevicius et al . 2006 ) , it is possible that men in mixed - gender groups attempt to make them - selves look more appealing to female members by talk - ing more and thereby sharing more information . How - ever , our ﬁndings—that group member participation is more balanced in groups with female members com - pared to all - male groups and that there is no diﬀerence in the participation variance among groups with zero , one , or two male members—stand in contrast to this suggestion . Another possibility is that the higher group member satisfaction in groups with at least one female mem - ber might at least be a partial driver of the higher lev - els of participation and information sharing—instead of being a consequence of it . Although our ﬁndings do suggest that interpersonally sensitive behavior is at least partially driving higher information sharing , we are not able to fully determine the directional causal relationships between interpersonally sensitive behav - ior , group member satisfaction , and information shar - ing . In particular , it is possible that , for example , satis - faction and interpersonally sensitive behavior interact and reinforce each other over time and to some extent jointly drive information sharing . It would be interest - ing to test the precise relationship among these vari - ables in an experiment by manipulating these factors independently from each other . This would provide more insights into this issue than our current work— which mainly focused on establishing the link between group gender composition , information sharing , and overconﬁdence , and less on the mechanisms that link the ﬁrst two of these factors . In conclusion , our ﬁndings indicate that , compared to all - male groups , the inclusion of female members signiﬁcantly improves information sharing and , as a consequence , conﬁdence calibration . Our ﬁndings have implications for research on group overconﬁ - dence and group judgments in general , as well as for other scholarly work on gender diversity in organiza - tions and managerial practice . In particular , we high - lighted mechanisms under which the inclusion of more women in top management teams or boards of direc - tors might be beneﬁcial for organizational outcomes .

Endnotes 1 In both studies , we determined the sample size in advance and did not add or drop observations after we started our analyses other than where reported in the paper . We also did not collect data other than those reported in the paper . 2 In neither experiment were any eﬀects found arising from the gen - der of the person who entered the decisions . 3 We also conducted our analysis using the signed diﬀerences and obtained overall very similar results . 4 For most of our statistical analysis , we analyzed our data at the decision - maker level ( either individuals or groups ) by conducting mixed ANOVAs—using conﬁdence levels ( three levels ) as a within - subject factor and decision - maker type ( six types ) as a between - subject factor . Here , degrees of freedom should be 148 ( calculated as 154 − 6 , where 154 refers to the total number of decision makers and 6 the number of decision - maker types ) for the between - subject eﬀect , and 296 ( calculated as 148 × 2 , where 2 refers to the number of conﬁdence level minus one ) for the within - subject eﬀect and the interaction eﬀect . 5 Alternatively , in both studies we also conducted simple F - tests for which we averaged the results over all three conﬁdence levels . This analysis gave consistent results , and our main ﬁndings remained signiﬁcant . 6 It is important to note that the average accuracy and interval width are only noisy predictors of the calibration error—e . g . , a decision maker could be very inaccurate and have narrow intervals on one or two questions leading to an overall very high average percentage error and low interval width but for the rest of the questions pro - vide intervals that contain the true values leading to an overall good calibration . 7 In both studies , we also tested for diﬀerences between male and female members within mixed - gender groups with respect to all main measures discussed in the analysis but found no systematic signiﬁcant diﬀerences . 8 There were three observations for the Microsoft forecasts that resulted in negative volatilities . We removed these observations from the analysis . Including them does not change the signiﬁcance of our main results . 9 A detailed overview of our data for ﬁnancial forecasts in both experiments and the random - walk task can be found in the online appendix . 10 Although this diﬀerence was not signiﬁcant , we found that inter - vals in all - female groups ( M (cid:3) 34 . 3 , SD (cid:3) 29 . 30 ) were considerably wider than in other groups . This might be because some members felt less conﬁdent about their understanding of the task because of gender stereotypes concerning mathematical abilities that might be more prominent in all - female groups . 11 To determine the required sample size , we conducted a power analysis based on the observed eﬀect sizes in Study 1 . To achieve a satisfactory minimum power of 0 . 8 ( e . g . , Cohen 1992 ) with α (cid:3) 0 . 05 for a comparison of calibration errors between all - male groups and other group types averaged over all three conﬁdence levels with a simple t - test , we would require a sample of size of about 36 in each D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 137 . 132 . 123 . 69 ] on 27 J un e 2018 , a t 20 : 56 .

This would then also provide us with an excellent power of 0 . 97 to detect eﬀects at the 90 % conﬁdence level where our eﬀect was the strongest . 12 We removed one observation from this condition as the partici - pant’s answers strongly indicated that she did not follow the experi - mental instructions . 13 The choice of the two knowledge domains was guided by the result of a pretest with 68 students , which indicated that students con - sidered themselves moderately knowledgeable with respect to both domains ( M (cid:3) 4 . 20 and M (cid:3) 4 . 04 for distances and prices , respectively , on a 1 (cid:3) “not at all” to 7 (cid:3) “very much” scale ) and that there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in perceived knowledge between male and female students . 14 Again , our choice of this item was guided by a pretest indicating at least a moderate level of familiarity ( M (cid:3) 3 . 70 ) and no signiﬁcant gender diﬀerences . 15 Due to an organizational mistake , we lost the data on opinion and information sharing for nine groups ( three in the female - majority condition and two in each of the other conditions ) . Therefore , our following analysis is based on the remaining 133 groups . 16 We also analyzed our two variables of interest with OLS regres - sions in which we clustered standard errors at the group level . This analysis gave results consistent with those provided here . 17 Note , however , that even in boards and top management teams , decisions made by groups of three are not uncommon . For example , the size of the board of directors largely depends on the size of the ﬁrm , and smaller ﬁrms have been reported to have an average size of three to four ( e . g . , Bennedsen et al . 2008 ) . Moreover , many board decisions are made by subcommittees that are only comprised of a small number of three to ﬁve board members . Similarly , strategic decisions are often made by a small subgroup of the top manage - ment team that consists of for example the CEO , COO , and head of a particular functional area , such as the CFO ( e . g . , Miles and Watkins 2007 ) .
