Classes of ideas : • conceptualisations of physical objects ; • psychological meanings associated with objects ; • memories ; • plans for the future ; • intentions to modify the behaviour of self ; • intentions to modify the behaviour of surrounding beings ; • processing of sensory states ( e . g . pleasure , pain ) ; • inhibition of a response based on immediate evolutionary ben - eﬁt ( e . g . selﬁsh genes or memes ) ; • interactive conceptualisations of ideas in a community based response ; • creativity ideas ( e . g . images , plans , relations , values ) . 11 Concepts : the building blocks of knowledge , both in practical and in more abstract disciplines . Examples : • a deﬁnition complemented by like - this examples ; • a deﬁnition complemented by hands - on examples ; • a collection of applications ; • a list of related ideas . 12 Networks Small - world network : it may contain billions of nodes , but it takes only a few intermediate nodes to move from one node to any other . • shortest path : the length , in term of edges , of the shortest connection between two nodes • mean path : the average of the shortest paths calculated on all pairs of nodes in the graph between which a path exists . • degree of a node : the number k of incoming and outgoing links from a node • P ( k ) : probability density function of degree k 13 Small - world networks : Two types : • random : P ( k ) has a Poisson distribution • scale - free : P ( k ) ∼ k − c , where c > 0 . Examples : The Internet : scale - free with 2 ≤ c ≤ 3 = ⇒ robustness and resilience to failure 14 Challenges of designing an experiment • the restriction of the term “idea” , to something manageable in a real - world experiment ; • the restriction of the term “concept” ; • a choice of stimuli which could describe a world small enough for making the building of a network through connections a sen - sible operation , but also as sparse as it is needed , in order to avoid the risk of self - referencing . • stimuli cardinality , in order to strike a balance between the subjects’ freedom in the connection search process and intrinsic limits of visual and verbal memory . 15 Idea Restriction : Our ideas will be objects such as tools , animals , vegetables , represented through their images and names . 16 Concept restriction : We use concept as the term indicating a relationship between ideas , and speciﬁcally a pair of ideas . 17 Choice : We sample the ideas from a standard database commonly used in psychological experiments on perception , the elements of which were tested for recognisability , name agreement and familiarity . 18 Cardinality : We use 96 ideas , allowing the subject to create chains of con - nections up to a maximum 48 - ideas long . 19 Subjects 90 subjects , in two diﬀerent Universities : Imperial College in London , UK , and Universita degli Studi di Palermo , Italy . gender mother tongue age group M F ital . engl . greek chin . other 18 - 24 25 - 35 > 35 60 % 40 % 51 % 9 % 12 % 12 % 16 % 58 % 33 % 9 % 20 Ideas selected for the experiment 21 001 Anchor Ancora 049 Igloo Igloo 002 Apple Mela 050 Kangaroo Canguro 003 Arrow Freccia 051 Key Chiave 004 Backpack Zaino 052 Funnel Imbuto 005 Banana Banana 053 Knife Coltello 006 Bottle Bottiglia 054 Leaf Foglia 007 Bed Letto 055 Lion Leone 008 Bone Osso 056 Lipstick Rossetto 009 Book Libro 057 Mask Maschera 010 Broom Scopa 058 Mirror Specchio 011 Butterﬂy Farfalla 059 Moon Luna 012 Button Bottone 060 Mushroom Fungo 013 Cake Torta 061 Pear Pera 014 Candle Candela 062 Pen Penna 015 Cigarette Sigaretta 063 Pencil Matita 016 Carrot Carota 064 Penguin Pinguino 017 Crown Corona 065 Piano Pianoforte 018 Chair Sedia 066 Ladder Scala 019 Cheese Formaggio 067 Pineapple Ananasso 020 Church Chiesa 068 Light - bulb Lampadina 021 Comb Pettine 069 Plane Aeroplano 022 Cross Croce 070 Puzzle Puzzle 023 Dog Cane 071 Pyramid Piramide 024 Dolphin Delﬁno 072 Rake Rastrello 025 Door Porta 073 Ring Anello 026 Dragon Drago 074 Robot Robot 027 Drawer Cassetto 075 Saddle Sella 028 Ear Orecchio 076 Saw Sega 029 Elephant Elefante 077 Scarf Sciarpa 030 Fire Fuoco 078 Shoe Scarpa 22 031 Fish Pesce 079 Skeleton Scheletro 032 Flag Bandiera 080 Slider Scivolo 033 Flower Fiore 081 Spider Ragno 034 Fork Forchetta 082 Strawberry Fragola 035 Ghost Fantasma 083 Sun Sole 036 Giraﬀe Giraﬀa 084 Table Tavolo 037 Glasses Occhiali 085 Tent Tenda 038 Globe Mappamondo 086 Tie Cravatta 039 Frog Rana 087 Train Treno 040 Guitar Chitarra 088 Tree Albero 041 Hammer Martello 089 Turtle Tartaruga 042 Hand Mano 090 Umbrella Ombrello 043 Hat Cappello 091 Watch Orologio 044 Heart Cuore 092 Well Pozzo 045 Helicopter Elicottero 093 Wheel Ruota 046 Helmet Casco 094 Whistle Fischietto 047 Horse Cavallo 095 Window Finestra 048 House Casa 096 Zebra Zebra 23 Stimuli The stimuli used in the experiment were a subset of the 520 stimuli used by the Internet Picture Naming Project http : / / crl . ucsd . edu / aszekely / ipnp / 520 300 × 300 pixels black and white images depicting common objects B .

The software driving the tests had been programmed in - house using common - place development tools and an object oriented language . The subject was given a mouse connected to the system , in order to execute the required task . 27 Procedure The subject was introduced to the test room , and invited to sit in front of the screen . A brief data collection session , useful for statistical purposes , followed . 28 Procedure - Visual • All 96 images were displayed on the monitor , arranged in a 12 × 8 grid . • Their position was randomised for each subject , and was kept constant during each trial . • Explicit remarks were made to make it clear that the test was not against the clock , and that there were no right answers per se , but the interest of the experimenters was in the subjective response . 29 • The subject was left alone for 5 minutes , in order to avoid perceived pressure from the experimenter . • The experimenter returned to the room and asked the subject if any of the images represented on the screen was ambiguous , or meaningless . In case of an aﬃrmative answer , the experimenter gave the subject clariﬁcations about the ambiguous image , avoid - ing explicitly naming the idea . 30 • The computer chose a random object from which to start the connection building process , and the experimenter invited the subject to pinpoint the object that they felt being more similar to the one selected , and click on it using the mouse . • The previously selected object disappeared , and the newly clicked object was selected . The experimenter asked the sub - ject to repeat the task , now starting from the newly selected object , again and again . • When 48 of the 96 objects had been selected , a greeting mes - sage was displayed , and the test ended . The software automat - ically recorded all the links created by the subject , and the total elapsed time for the linking process , for statistical purposes . • The subject was reminded of the fact that a second session of the experiment would be held in the near future . 31 Two months later : Procedure - Verbal The procedure was almost the same , except : • The grid was now 6 × 16 , and the names representing the ideas were presented black on white , in a sans serif font . • After the familiarisation phase , the experimenter asked the subject to scan the grid for unknown names , and in case some was found , explained which idea the name represented , avoiding using circular deﬁnitions and other names already present in the grid . For each subject , the starting ideas used in the verbal experiment were kept the same as the ones used in the visual experiment . 32 33 Networks of ideas • Each idea is a node . • The links between nodes are representations of the connections created by the experimental subjects during the trials . • The network is built by adding to the graph all of the connec - tions made by all subjects . • The ﬁrst object of any trial , being randomly chosen , is not included in the network . 34 Network analysis : a small - world The mean path m for both the visual and verbal networks of ideas , the standard deviation of the distribution of k , and for comparison , log ( n ) ( where n is the number of nodes of the net - work ) visual network verbal network m 1 . 79 1 . 78 σ 0 . 45 0 . 44 log ( n ) 4 . 56 4 . 56 35 Random or scale - free ?

In the full networks the overlap is about 80 % . 45 Conclusion concerning the networks of ideas Our results indicate the presence of a single network of ideas , of random network topology , with hubs that may be invoked either verbally or visually . 46 Networks of concepts • nodes : representations of concepts , i . e . relationships between ideas • edges : consequential connections between concepts . • An oriented graphs . Each node of the graph is a speciﬁc concept relating an idea with another , represented by a pair ( a , b ) , in which a is the connecting idea and b is the connected idea . Each edge in the graph connects two concepts if those two concepts have been selected in a temporal succession , and has the direction of the temporal ﬂux . • The networks are built by adding to the graph each connection made by each subject . 47 The visual network of concepts 48 Network analysis They are both small - world networks with similar topologies . 49 The mean path m for both the visual and verbal networks of concepts , the standard deviation of the distribution of k , and for comparison , log ( n ) ( where n is the number of nodes of the network ) visual network verbal network m 10 . 15 10 . 49 σ 3 . 43 3 . 59 log ( n ) 6 . 62 6 . 63 50 Random or scale - free ? At the 95 % conﬁdence level , both our connectivity distri - butions are compatible with a power law distribution with the c value between 2 . 5 and 2 . 8 for the visual network of concepts and between 2 . 6 and 2 . 7 for the verbal network of concepts . Such a c value is in the range of a proper scale - free network . 51 A result of chance ? • A Monte Carlo simulation of our experiment using the same parameters as in the original experiment , namely a repetition of 90 trials using 96 ideas and linking 48 ideas in each test , this time choosing the links at random using a pseudo - random number generator . • We repeated this simulation 100 times , always obtaining dis - tributions of the k values that did not resemble at all the power law distribution . 52 Tests for robustness • A leave - one - out test on the set , repeating our analysis 90 times , each time excluding the set of links corresponding to one subject from the test . In each instance we obtained a scale - free network , with the same relationships as the ones in the original experiment acting as hubs . • We performed a Monte Carlo variation of the test , leaving out 5 randomly chosen subjects’ sets of choices each time , and repeating this test 100 times . All of the networks built in such a way were characterised by power law distributions of the node connectivities , and , compared with the original experiment , there were only marginal diﬀerences at the lower end of the hub list . 53 Histograms of the values of k for both the visual and the verbal networks of concepts . 54 The results of the goodness - of - ﬁt tests for both the visual and verbal degree distributions . Along the horizontal axis we measure the parameter of the dis - tribution for which the test is done , while along the vertical axis we measure the conﬁdence level of the test . 55 56 Hubs and the role of visual and verbal cues Nodes represent relationships ⇒ the hubs are special relationships which are connected to a variety of other relationships . From the point of view of mind processes : the relationships that play the role of hubs may be the focal points from which many diverse scenarios emanate . The logical path in the mind is not a sequence of individual ideas , but a sequence of relationships ! 57 Hubs of the networks of concepts visual network k verbal network k ( knife , fork ) 24 ( horse , saddle ) 18 ( tree , leaf ) 20 ( sun , moon ) 17 ( horse , saddle ) 18 ( tree , leaf ) 15 ( door , window ) 17 ( pencil , pen ) 14 ( church , cross ) 16 ( plane , helicopter ) 14 ( table , chair ) 16 ( knife , fork ) 13 ( leaf , tree ) 15 ( church , cross ) 13 ( igloo , penguin ) 15 ( door , window ) 11 ( cross , church ) 15 ( glasses , mirror ) 11 ( pen , pencil ) 14 ( fork , knife ) 11 ( fork , knife ) 14 ( table , chair ) 11 ( window , door ) 14 58 Looking closer . . . The diﬀerence between the hubs in the two halves of the same experiment is roughly the same as the diﬀerence between the hubs of the verbal and visual experiments . This does not allow us to decide whether the 50 % overlap is an indicator of two separate networks , or it is simply due to the diﬀerences arising from the randomness of the processes involved . 59 Node measurements for the subnetworks of concepts UK visual subnetwork UK verbal subnetwork m 10 . 59 4 . 88 σ 6 . 60 3 . 03 log ( n ) 6 . 05 5 . 89 Italian visual subnetwork Italian verbal subnetwork m 6 . 08 5 . 56 σ 3 . 61 3 . 67 log ( n ) 6 . 00 6 . 00 60 Results of the chi - square test on the subnetworks of concepts UK visual subnetwork Hyp .

Further research work should be devoted to expand the meaning of idea and concept to other categories , comparing networks built in diﬀerent social contexts , and integrating the results of the perceptual experiment with both knowledge from the medical imaging framework and psychological models of memory storage .
