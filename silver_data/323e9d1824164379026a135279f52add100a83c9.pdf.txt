ORIGINAL RESEARCH Common and specific neural correlates underlying insight and ordinary problem solving Jiabao Lin 1 , 2 , 3 & Xue Wen 4 & Xuan Cui 2 , 3 & Yanhui Xiang 5 & Jiushu Xie 6 & Yajue Chen 2 , 3 & Ruiwang Huang 2 , 3 & Lei Mo 2 , 3 # Springer Science + Business Media , LLC , part of Springer Nature 2020 Abstract Previous studies have investigated the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying insight problem solving ( INPS ) . However , it is still unclear which mechanisms are common to both INPS and ordinary problem solving ( ORPS ) , and which are distinctly involved in only one of these processes . In this study , we selected two types of Chinese character chunk decompositions , ordinary Chinese character chunk decomposition ( OCD ) and creative Chinese character chunk decomposition ( CCD ) , as representatives of ORPS and INPS , respectively . By using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to record brain activations when subjects executed OCD or CCD operations , we found that both ORPS and INPS resulted in significant activations in the widespread frontoparietal cognitive control network , including the middle frontal gyrus , inferior frontal gyrus , and inferior parietal lobe . Furthermore , compared with ORPS , INPS led to greater activations in higher - level brain regions related to symbolic processing in the default mode network , including the anterior cingulate cortex , superior temporal gyrus , angular gyrus , and precuneus . Conversely , ORPS induced greater activations than INPS in more posterior brain regions related to visuospatial attention and visual perception , such as the inferior temporal gyrus , hippocampus , and middle occipital gyrus / superior parietal gyrus / fusiform gyrus . In addition , an ROI analysis corroborated the neural commonalities and differences between ORPS and INPS . These findings provide new evidence that ORPS and INPS rely on common as well as distinct cognitive processes and cortical mechanisms . Keywords Ordinary problem solving . Insight problem solving .

Traditionally , problem solving is defined as a goal - directed stepwise sequence of cognitive operations ( Anderson et al . 2003 ; Jonassen 2000 ) and has been suc - cessful in explaining how people solve ordinary problems , such as the algebraic equation problem ( Qin et al . 2004 ) . However , previous studies suggested that problem solving does not always proceed step by step , and problems can be solved with a sudden flash of insight , such as the one de - scribed in the candle problem ( Bowden 1997 ; Duncker and Lees 1945 ) . Previous behavior researches have studied the features of ordinary problem solving ( ORPS ) and insight problem solving ( INPS ) , such as influencing factors ( Perkins et al . 1986 ; Yang et al . 2016 ) , phases ( Amabile 1988 ; D ' zurilla and Goldfried 1971 ) , and mechanisms ( Jonassen 2000 ; Kershaw and Ohlsson 2004 ) . However , the neural mechanisms underlying problem solving have only recently been explored by researchers . Previous studies have found that a frontoparietal cognitive control network , including the middle frontal gyrus ( MFG ) , inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG ) , and inferior parietal lobe ( IPL ) , is involved in various types of ORPS , such as algorithmic prob - lems ( e . g . , the algebraic equation problems ) ( Anderson et al . 2003 ; Qin et al . 2004 ) , logical problems ( e . g . , the Tower of London or Tower of Hanoi tasks ) ( Fincham et al . ( 2002 ) ; Newman et al . 2003 ) , decision making problems ( e . g . , the Stroop task or n - back tasks ) ( Derrfuss et al . 2005 ; Ruge et al . 2005 ) , and other symbol manipulation tasks ( Sohn et al . 2005 ) . For example , in a brain imaging study of algebra - ic equation problems , participants were solving equations such as the following : 7x + 1 = 29 . The results showed that a brain network including the IFG , MFG , and IPL was activated in this ORPS task ( Qin et al . 2004 ) . Fincham et al . ( 2002 ) investigated neural mechanisms underlying the Tower of Hanoi task and found that a frontoparietal system including the IFG , MFG , and bilateral IPL plays an important role in this task . A meta - analysis showed that the IFG is commonly acti - vated in the Stroop paradigm and the n - back task ( Derrfuss et al . 2005 ) . Based on these findings , researchers have sug - gested that this frontoparietal network serves as a core brain region for general problem - solving processes ( Jonassen 2000 ; Sohn et al . 2005 ) . However , as a specific form of problem solving , INPS refers to a creative comprehension and solution of a problem ( Kounios et al . 2006 ) and could be more com - plex than ORPS . For instance , in addition to the processes of mental representation and manipulation involved in ORPS , INPS could involve more processes , such as breaking mental sets and switching attention ( Knoblich et al . 1999 ; Tang et al . 2015 ) . As such , complex INPS might recruit more widespread brain regions rather than just the so - called frontoparietal net - work observed during ORPS . Thus far , few experiments have focused on the neural commonalities and differences underly - ing ORPS and INPS . INPS is unpredictable and hard to elicit in the laboratory . However , creative chunk decomposition has been proved to be a special type of INPS , which provides a valid way to study the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying INPS ( Dreu et al . 2011 ; Huang et al . 2015 ; Knoblich et al . 1999 ; Tang et al . 2015 ; Nijstad et al . 2010 ; Ohlsson 1992 ; Öllinger et al . 2008 ; Scott 1962 ; Wu et al . 2009 ) . Chunk decomposition means decomposing patterns into basic components . They can be reorganized in a new way ( Knoblich et al . 1999 ) . For instance , Knoblich et al . ( 1999 ) employed a matchstick arithmetic prob - lem , needing chunk decomposition , to study INPS . In the experiment , they required participants to move one stick to change faulty equations , including ( 1 ) IV = III + III and ( 2 ) XI = III + III , into the same correct one ( 3 ) VI = III + III . Results showed that participants change the eq . ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) easily . However , changing the eq . ( 2 ) to ( 3 ) is rather difficult ( Knoblich et al . 1999 ) . This is because “ IV ” is a loose chunk and consists of the meaningful sub - chunks “ I ” and “ V ” . In contrast , “ X ” and “ V ” are tight chunks and consist of the meaningless strokes “ \ ” and “ / ” . Previous studies indicated that tight chunks , which are different from loose chunks , can induce an obstacle to problem solving ( Knoblich et al . 2001 ; Wu et al . 2013 ) . Brain Imaging and Behavior Recently , a new chunk decomposition task , called Chinese character chunk decomposition , has been developed to study the neural mechanism underlying INPS ( Huang et al . 2015 ; Luo et al . 2006 ; Tang et al . 2015 ; Wu et al . 2013 ) . This task can furnish sufficient trials for neuroimaging analyses ( Huang et al . 2015 ) . In brief , this task asked participants to change Chinese characters into new ones through removing radicals or strokes . Radicals are sub - chunks , carrying some meaning , whereas strokes are basic elements , carrying no meaning . Specifically , radical - level decomposition was defined as decomposing the character “ 他 ” , a loose chunk , into “ 亻 ” and “ 也 ” , like “ I ” and “ V ” in the number “ IV ” , while stroke - level decomposition was defined as decomposing the charac - ter “ 四 ” , a tight chunk , into “ 匹 ” and “ 丨 ” , like “ \ ” and “ / ” in the number “ V ” . With this Chinese character chunk decom - position task , researchers found that tight chunk decomposi - tion ( i . e . , insight condition ) induced greater activations in the IFG , MFG , and medial prefrontal gyrus ( MPFC ) than loose chunk decomposition ( i . e . , non - insight condition ) ( Luo et al . 2006 ; Wu et al . 2013 ) . However , previous studies did not consider the three follow - ing limitations ( Huang et al . 2015 ; Luo et al . 2006 ; Wu et al . 2009 , 2013 ) . First , these activations related to INPS were ob - tained only in a simple direct contrast between insight ( tight ) and non - insight ( loose ) chunk decompositions ( Luo et al . 2006 ; Wu et al . 2013 ) . Thus , it was impossible to distinguish common and specific brain regions related to ORPS and INPS . Second , previous studies confounded the effects of difficulty and crea - tivity ( Huang et al . 2015 ; Luo et al . 2006 ; Wu et al . 2013 ) . Stroke - level decomposition is difficult , but it does not mean that it is creative or insightful . For example , in the stroke - level decomposition condition , participants were asked to decom - pose the character “ 四 ” into the new character “ 匹 ” by removing the portion ( stroke ) “ 丨 ” , an operation that meets expectations of existing knowledge . Since the characters “ 四 ” and “ 匹 ” are visually similar , it is easy to remove the “ 丨 ” in an obvious , intuitive way . In contrast , if we asked participants to decompose the character “ 四 ” into the new portion “ 丨 ” by removing the intact character “ 匹 ” , this operation would violate expectations of existing knowledge . Because the character “ 四 ” and the part “ 丨 ” are visually different , removing the intact character “ 匹 ” from the whole structure “ 四 ” feels unintuitive and goes against habitual thinking . In a recently published study , we found that decomposing an intact character from a specific character feels more unusual to participants than decomposing a portion from a specific character , according to response times and novelty as - sessments ( Lin et al . 2018 ) . Third , the chunk decomposition process was triggered by an external hint and not generated by the participants themselves , which goes against principles of spontaneity of thinking . For instance , in each trial , the char - acter and the to - be - removed portion ( a stroke or radical ) ap - peared simultaneously on the same screen , and participants could decompose the chunk merely based on “ external ” visual perception , not “ internal ” spontaneous thinking ( Luo et al . 2006 ; Wu et al . 2009 , 2013 ) . In the present study , we designed two tasks to determine if INPS shares overlapping cognitive and neural mechanisms with ORPS . One task was an ORPS task , which required participants to perform ordinary Chinese character chunk de - composition ( OCD ) at low and high difficult levels . The other task was an INPS task , which required participants to perform creative Chinese character chunk decomposition ( CCD ) at low and high creative levels . Thus , we set up four conditions , ordinary chunk decomposition - low difficult level ( OCDL ) , ordinary chunk decomposition - high difficult level ( OCDH ) , creative chunk decomposition - low creative level ( CCDL ) , and creative chunk decomposition - high creative level ( CCDH ) . Specifically , for the OCDL condition , participants needed to decompose an existing character into a target character through removing a radical , such as decomposing the charac - ter “ 他 ” into “ 也 ” , through removing the “ 亻 ” . This operation feels familiar and easy to participants and can be performed in an obvious way . For the OCDH condition , participants needed to decompose an existing character into a target character through removing a stroke , such as decomposing the character “ 四 ” into “ 匹 ” , through removing the “ 丨 ” . This operation feels familiar but difficult to participants and can also be per - formed in an obvious way . Several studies suggested that it is harder to remove a stroke than a radical from a Chinese Fig . 1 Experimental stimuli and procedure . a Exemplars of ordinary chunk decomposition at low and high difficult levels , and creative chunk decomposition at low and high creative levels . The portions in red needed to be removed during chunk decomposition . b Time line of a chunk decomposition . Participants first viewed an existing character on the screen . Then , a target character appeared on the screen . Participants needed to transform the existing character into the target character by removing a portion , which constitutes problem solving . Participants responded by pressing a key as soon as they had solved the problem . Subsequently , another portion ( a radical , stroke , compound character , or isolated character ) appeared on the screen . Participants should indicate whether this portion was the same as the that portion found before as fast as they could Brain Imaging and Behavior character ( Luo et al . 2006 ; Wu et al . 2013 ) . For the CCDL condition , participants needed to decompose an existing char - acter into a target character through removing a compound character , such as decomposing the character “ 拐 ” into “ 力 ” by removing the “ 扣 ” . This operation is creative for partici - pants . Notably , the to - be - removed character , such as “ 扣 ” , is already spatially separated from the target character , such as “ 力 ” . This type of decomposition has a higher success rate . For the CCDH condition , participants needed to decompose an existing character into a target character through removing an isolated character , such as decomposing the character “ 固 ” into “ 十 ” through removing the “ 回 ” . This operation is even more creative for participants . However , in this case , the to - be - removed character , such as “ 回 ” , is visually interlinked with the target character , such as “ 十 ” . Thus , this type of decomposition has a lower success rate ( Fig . 1 ) . In this study , the task arrangement restricted the participants ’ way to de - compose the existing characters into the target characters , which represents a reasonable problem - solving process . Besides , to reduce the impact of visual perception , the existing characters and target characters were presented separately . Based on earlier neuroimaging findings for ORPS , such as algebraic equation solving ( Qin et al . 2004 ) , and INPS , such as riddle solving ( Zhao et al . 2013 ) , we mainly focused on activations in the frontoparietal network , the temporoparietal junction , and the anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) . Specifically , we hypothesized that both INPS and ORPS would share regions within the frontoparietal network , such as the IFG , MFG , and IPL , because these regions are typically related to cognitive control and manipulation ( Fincham et al . 2002 ; Qin et al . 2004 ) . Furthermore , compared with ORPS , we expected INPS to recruit different regions , including the ACC and the temporoparietal junction , which are related to breaking mental sets , forming associations and conflict regu - lation ( Huang et al . 2018 ; Zhao et al . 2013 ) . Finally , for ORPS in this visual task , it was easy for participants to change an existing character ( e . g . , “ 四 ” ) into a target character ( e . g . , “ 匹 ” ) through removing a part ( e . g . , “ 丨 ” ) merely based on visual - perceptual features of the character . ORPS might recruit more visual perception components but not higher levels of reason - ing than INPS . Thus , we deduced that ORPS might activate different regions ( e . g . , occipital and visual cortex ) than INPS . Materials and methods Participants Thirty - two healthy students aged 19 – 27 years from South China Normal University , including 17 males and 15 females , were recruited in the present study . All of them were native Chinese speakers . Inclusion criterions were as follows . ( 1 ) Participants were right - handed . Specifically , the present study used the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory comprising 20 items about hand preference to measure the handedness of each participant . ( 2 ) Participants had normal or corrected - to - normal vision . ( 3 ) Participants with no history of neurological or psychiatric disor - ders assessed by self - report were included in this study . Written informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki was obtained from all individual participants included in the study . The experiment protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Review Board of South China Normal University according to the Declaration of Helsinki . The participants received 120 CNY for participation in the present study . Materials Chinese characters have an orthographic structure ( Tan et al . 2001 ) . They are considered ideal chunks ( Tang et al . 2015 ) . In the experiment , 160 existing Chinese characters with four dif - ferent chunk decomposition types were used as stimuli in the OCDL , OCDH , CCDL , and CCDH conditions ( Fig . 1 ) . First , 20 participants who did not take part in our fMRI study rated the Chinese characters for 100 % familiarity with a 5 - point scale . Second , 160 characters were chosen from 306 frequent - ly used Chinese characters . Finally , the selected characters were classified into four groups ( i . e . , OCDL , OCDH , CCDL , and CCDH , 40 characters per group ) according to their decomposition types . To ensure creativity and control level features , another 20 participants ( also not in our fMRI study ) assessed the creativ - ity features of CCD and OCD operations with a 5 - point crea - tivity scale . Creativity assessments based on the paired sam - ples t - tests showed that CCD operations were perceived as significantly more creative than OCD operations [ t ( 19 ) = 22 . 87 , p < 0 . 001 ] . For the level features in creativity assess - ments , paired samples t - tests indicated that CCDH operations were perceived as significantly higher in creativity than CCDL operations [ t ( 19 ) = 7 . 79 , p < 0 . 001 ] . Furthermore , these participants were also asked to rate “ Aha ! ” experience of CCD and OCD operations on a 5 - point “ Aha ! ” experience scale . Results showed that CCD operations induced more “ Aha ! ” experience than OCD operations [ t ( 19 ) = 22 . 93 , p < 0 . 001 ] . For level features of “ Aha ! ” experience , results indicated that CCDH operations were regarded as more sur - prising than CCDL operations [ t ( 19 ) = 7 . 87 , p < 0 . 001 ] . The details of these stimulus pretests are presented in the Supplementary Material . Procedure Figure 1 illustrates the experimental procedure of the present study . We separated the 160 trials into four runs equally . Thus , a run included 10 trials per condition . All trials within each run were randomized . Orders of the four runs were counterbalanced among participants . For a single trial , an Brain Imaging and Behavior existing character first appeared on the screen . Participants needed to remember this character in a fixed duration of 2 s . Subsequently , a target character appeared on the screen . Participants must transform the existing character into the tar - get character as fast as they could within 6 s . Namely , partic - ipants needed to find the to - be - removed portion ( i . e . , a radical , stroke , compound character , or isolated character ) of the existing character by pressing a button as soon as they could in 6 s . Afterwards , another portion was provided on the screen . Participants had to confirm if the to - be - removed portion they found before was the same as this provided portion within 3 s as fast as they could . Notably , half of the provided portions are correct . A resting interval that randomly ranged from 4 to 5 s was inserted between trials . All participant had a training ses - sion outside of the scanner . The training stimuli were different from those employed during fMRI experiment . Image acquisition Scanning was carried out at South China Normal University by using a 3 T Siemens Trio Tim MRI scanner . Whole brain functional images were acquired by using a gradient - echo echo - planar imaging ( EPI ) sequence . The imaging parameters were as follows : TR = 2000 ms , TE = 30 ms , FOV = 204 × 204 mm 2 , flip angle = 90° , data matrix = 64 × 64 , 33 axial slices with 3 . 5 mm thick each , 0 . 8 mm gap . Moreover , we also acquired high - resolution T1 - weighted anatomical scans by using a T1 - weighted 3D MP - RAGE sequence . The imag - ing parameters were TR = 1900 ms , TE = 2 . 52 ms , FA = 9° , data matrix = 256 × 256 , FOV = 256 × 256 mm 2 , thickness = 1 . 0 mm , and 176 sagittal slices covering the whole brain . fMRI data analysis All images were analyzed with SPM12 ( http : / / www . fil . ion . ucl . ac . uk / spm ) . The preprocessing analysis was performed by several steps . Firstly , we removed the first five functional volumes of each run to avoid a potential T1 - equilibration ef - fect . Secondly , we performed slice - timing and head motion correction for the remaining volumes . Thirdly , the corrected volumes were co - registered with their corresponding T1 - weighted images . They were then normalized to the standard MNI T1 brain and resampled to 3 - mm isotropic voxels . Finally , we smoothed the normalized data through using a 6 - mm Gaussian kernel of full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) . In the first - level analysis , an event - related statistical model consisting of four experimental events ( CCDL , CCDH , OCDL , and OCDH ) and six motion parameters was created for each participant . Specifically , trials with correct responses for each experimental condition were modeled as regressors of interest . The six motion parameters were modeled as indepen - dent regressors of no interest . To discard low - frequency noise , we performed a high - pass filter with a cutoff period of 128 s . Finally , for each participant , we obtained contrast images of each experimental condition relative to the baseline . These images were later used for a second - level group analysis using a random - effects model . Whole - brain analyses In the second - level analysis , the contrast images from the first - level analysis were entered into a 2 × 2 repeated - measures analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with the factors type of problem - solving ( insight , ordinary ) and level feature of problem - solving ( high , low ) . Briefly , we first calculated the brain activations for INPS ( contrast : CCDH - CCDL ) and ORPS ( contrast : OCDH - OCDL ) separately . Then we con - ducted a conjunction analysis for these two contrasts men - tioned above . We aimed to examine if INPS and ORPS share a common neural mechanism or not . Additionally , to estimate the neural mechanisms that differ between INPS and ORPS , we tested the interactions between the type of problem - solving ( insight , ordinary ) and level feature of problem - solving ( high , low ) with the contrast ± [ ( CCDH - CCDL ) - ( OCDH - OCDL ) ] . Finally , in order to determine if brain activations were related to the difficulty of the decomposition operation , we repeated the same analysis as described above by model - ing response times ( RTs ) as covariates of no interest . For the whole - brain analysis and the analysis using RTs as covariates of no interest , we adopted a combination threshold to correct multiple comparisons ( a voxel - level threshold of p < 0 . 001 ( uncorrected ) along with a cluster - level threshold of p < 0 . 05 ( FWE - corrected ) ) . ROI analyses Several studies have shown that the ACC , superior temporal gyrus ( STG ) , hippocampus ( HIP ) , IFG , precuneus ( PCUN ) , MPFC , and caudate play important roles in INPS ( Huang et al . 2015 ; Luo and Niki 2003 ; Luo et al . 2004 ; Zhao et al . 2013 ) . A review by Dietrich and Kanso ( 2010 ) also indicated that the ACC and STG are activated during INPS . We predicted that these regions might show different activations for INPS and ORPS . Therefore , we performed a region of interest ( ROI ) analysis to test this specific hypothesis . Meanwhile , a small volume correction was used to explore this issue . Each ROI of the bilateral ACC , STG , HIP , IFG , PCUN , MPFC , and cau - date was defined using the WFU Pick Atlas ( Version 3 . 0 , http : / / fmri . wfubmc . edu / software / PickAtlas ) . We adopted a combination threshold to correct multiple comparisons ( a voxel - level threshold of p < 0 . 001 ( uncorrected ) along with a cluster - level threshold of p < 0 . 05 ( FWE - corrected ) ) . Notably , the ROI analysis was used to provide complementary evi - dence for the whole brain analysis . Brain Imaging and Behavior Results Behavioral data Table 1 lists the mean RTs and correct rates ( CRs ) of each condition . As for the RTs , a 2 × 2 ANOVA revealed that the main effect of type of problem - solving was significant [ F ( 1 , 31 ) = 46 . 95 , p < 0 . 001 ] . We found that RTs during INPS were significantly longer than those during ORPS ( p < 0 . 001 ) . The main effect of level feature of problem - solving was also significant [ F ( 1 , 31 ) = 94 . 93 , p < 0 . 001 ] , as was the interaction between the factors [ F ( 1 , 31 ) = 13 . 88 , p < 0 . 001 ] . Post - hoc comparisons showed that the RTs for high difficulty were significantly longer than those for low difficulty during ORPS ( p < 0 . 001 ) , and the RTs for high creative were signif - icantly longer than those for low creative during INPS ( p < 0 . 001 ) . In addition , the mean CRs revealed a significant main effect of type of problem - solving [ F ( 1 , 31 ) = 25 . 80 , p < 0 . 001 ] and level feature of problem - solving [ F ( 1 , 31 ) = 67 . 00 , p < 0 . 001 ] . The CRs for INPS were significantly lower than those for ORPS ( p < 0 . 001 ) , but the interaction between the factors was not significant [ F ( 1 , 31 ) = 1 . 14 , p = 0 . 294 ] . An explorato - ry analysis indicated that the CRs for high difficulty were significantly lower than those for low difficulty during ORPS ( p < 0 . 001 ) , and the CRs for high creative were signif - icantly lower than those for low creative during INPS ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Finally , considering half of the provided portions in the second part of the stimulus presentation were incorrect , we also reported the CRs separately for trials in which the second part of the stimulus presentation involved the presentation of a correct portion vs . an incorrect portion . The details are pre - sented in the Table S1 in the Supplementary Material . fMRI data Whole - brain analyses Table 2 shows the results for ORPS ( contrast : OCDH - OCDL ) and INPS ( contrast : CCDH - CCDL ) . For ORPS , we found greater brain activations in the bilateral IPL , bilateral MFG , bilateral inferior temporal gyrus ( ITG ) , bilateral cere - bellum , right IFG , left insula , left HIP / caudate , and pons for OCDH compared to OCDL . Meanwhile , for INPS , we found greater brain activations in the bilateral MFG , right supramarginal gyrus ( SMG ) , right MPFC / middle cingulate cortex ( MCC ) , left IPL , left PCUN , right IFG , and right mid - dle temporal gyrus ( MTG ) for CCDH compared to CCDL . It seems that both types of problem - solving recruited similar brain networks , such as the cognitive control network . Thus , a further conjunction analysis of ORPS ( contrast : OCDH - OCDL ) and INPS ( contrast : CCDH - CCDL ) was performed , and we detected common activated regions in the bilateral MFG , right SMG , right sensorimotor areas ( SMA ) , left IPL , left superior parietal lobe ( SPL ) , and right IFG ( Fig . 2 ) . The detailed information for these brain regions is listed in Table 2 . To obtain more particular information regarding INPS and ORPS , we ran an interaction effect analysis using the contrast ± [ ( CCDH - CCDL ) - ( OCDH - OCDL ) ] . We detected greater activations in the bilateral angular gyrus ( AG ) , left superior frontal gyrus ( SFG ) , left PCUN , right ACC , right STG , and left MTG for INPS compared to ORPS [ ( CCDH - CCDL ) > ( OCDH - OCDL ) ] ( Fig . 3 ) . Meanwhile , we also detected greater activations in the bilateral MFG , bilateral IFG , left IPL , left HIP , left ITG , and right middle occipital gyrus ( MOG ) / SPL / fusiform gyrus ( FG ) for ORPS compared to INPS [ ( OCDH - OCDL ) > ( CCDH - CCDL ) ] ( Fig . 4 ) . The detailed information for these brain regions is listed in Table 3 . In addition , almost all of the results mentioned above were reproduced when using RTs as covariates of no interest in the analysis of the impact of task difficulty ( Tables 2 and 3 ) . Notably , the activation extent in each corresponding brain region decreased or increased . This implies that task difficulty ( calculated through RTs ) might account for our results to some extent . Therefore , we concluded that our findings could not be interpreted completely through task difficulty . ROI analyses Table 4 lists the results for the ROI analysis . For INPS ( contrast : CCDH - CCDL ) , we found greater brain activations in the right IFG , left PCUN , and right MPFC for CCDH compared to CCDL . For ORPS ( contrast : OCDH - OCDL ) , we found great - er brain activations in the bilateral IFG , bilateral PCUN , bilat - eral MPFC , and bilateral caudate for OCDH compared to OCDL . Meanwhile , the conjunction analysis of ORPS ( con - trast : OCDH - OCDL ) and INPS ( contrast : CCDH - CCDL ) indicated that the activations for ORPS and INPS overlapped in the right IFG , left PCUN , and right MPFC . Moreover , we also found significant interaction effects for the contrast ± [ ( CCDH - CCDL ) - ( OCDH - OCDL ) ] between INPS and ORPS . Specifically , we detected greater activations in the bilateral ACC , bilateral MPFC , left STG , and left PCUN for INPS Table 1 Response times and correct rates in all types of chunk decompositions ( Mean ± SD ) Condition Correct rate Response time ( ms ) OCDL 0 . 98 ± 0 . 04 933 . 25 ± 233 . 52 OCDH 0 . 93 ± 0 . 06 1387 . 54 ± 381 . 34 CCDL 0 . 95 ± 0 . 07 1466 . 66 ± 548 . 65 CCDH 0 . 88 ± 0 . 05 1700 . 45 ± 641 . 95 Abbreviations : SD standard deviation , OCDL ordinary chunk decomposition - low difficult level , OCDH ordinary chunk decomposition - high difficult level , CCDL creative chunk decomposition - low creative level , CCDH creative chunk decomposition - high creative level Brain Imaging and Behavior compared to ORPS .

Discussion This study used Chinese character chunk decompositions to explore the neural commonalities and differences between ORPS and INPS . The results showed the following : 1 ) The behavioral data confirmed our predicted hypothesis . We could efficiently manipulate the creativity and level feature of each chunk decomposition task . 2 ) Both ORPS and INPS recruited an overlapping widespread frontoparietal cognitive control network , including the MFG , IFG , and IPL . 3 ) INPS led to greater activations than ORPS in higher - level brain regions related to symbolic processing in the default mode network ( DMN ) , including the ACC , STG , AG , and PCUN .

These results provide new evidence for the neural commonalities and differences between INPS and ORPS . Common neural correlates of insight and ordinary problem solving There is a consensus that various types of problem solving rely on similar mental processes , such as the construction of a problem representation , the search for solutions , and the implementation and monitoring of solutions ( Gick 1986 ; Jonassen 2000 ; Newell and Simon 1972 ) . Previous researches have focused on the neural mechanisms of problem solving , such as algebraic problems ( Anderson et al . 2003 ) , the Tower of London problem ( Fincham et al . 2002 ) , decision making problems ( Derrfuss et al . 2005 ) , and insightful riddles ( Zhao et al . 2013 ) , and all found that different domains of problem solving might recruit a common frontoparietal network , in - cluding the IFG , MFG , and IPL . The results of the present study also showed that the neural correlates of INPS and ORPS overlap in the IFG , MFG , and IPL , which is in line with previous studies ( Anderson et al . 2003 ; Derrfuss et al . 2005 ; Fincham et al . 2002 ; Zhao et al . 2013 ) ( Table 2 ; Fig . 2 ) . This suggests that different types of problem solving may share a common neural correlate . Brain activations in the IFG and MFG in the present study demonstrate the indispensable and common roles of these re - gions in INPS and ORPS . Previous neuroimaging studies in - dicated that the IFG and MFG might play critical roles in inhibitory control ( Aron et al . 2003 ; Derrfuss et al . 2004 ; Hopfinger et al . 2000 ; Jonides et al . 1998 ) . For instance , Aron et al . ( 2003 ) studied patients with lesions in the right IFG and found that the IFG was related to response inhibition in a stop - signal task . Another study showed that the IFG and the MFG are commonly involved in response inhibition in task - switching paradigms , the Stroop task , and the n - back task ( Derrfuss et al . 2004 ) . Furthermore , a number of behavioral studies showed that both ORPS and INPS recruit processes of inhibitory control and decision making ( Bowden 1997 ; Jonassen 2000 ; Knoblich et al . 1999 ; Newell and Simon 1972 ) . For example , participants should inhibit the predomi - nant irrelevant mental representations during INPS ( Knoblich et al . 1999 ) . Based on the brain functions of the IFG and MFG and the behavioral evidence of ORPS and INPS . It seems therefore plausible that both ORPS and INPS recruited the IFG and MFG in this study . Fig . 3 Brain regions showing significant difference in activations obtained from the interaction analysis ( threshold : voxel - level uncorrected p < 0 . 001 and cluster - level FWE - corrected p < 0 . 05 ) . We found that INPS induces greater activations than ORPS in the bilateral AG , right ACC , left SFG , right STG , left PCUN , and left MTG .

Previous be - havioral studies indicated that both INPS and ORPS might involve goal - processing operations and manipulations ( Ash et al . 2009 ; Jonassen 2000 ; Knoblich et al . 1999 ; Newell and Simon 1972 ) . For example , Newell and Simon ( 1972 ) found that ORPS recruits processes of goal - directed cognitive operations and planning . Attentional control played an impor - tant role in INPS ( Knoblich et al . 1999 ) . Besides , previous neuroimaging studies reported that ORPS and INPS could involve the IPL ( Tang et al . 2015 ; Qin et al . 2004 ) . Based on the brain functions of IPL and the behavioral and neuroimag - ing studies of ORPS and INPS , it may be reasonable that both INPS and ORPS recruited the IPL in the present study . In fact , both INPS and ORPS tasks in the present study required participants to transform an existing chunk ( old rep - resentation ) into a target chunk ( new representation ) . Participants might need more attentional resources and cogni - tive operation resources to suppress irrelevant representations and to establish the target representations , which would recruit the IFG , MFG , and IPL in the cognitive control networks . Moreover , basic imagery operations during either INPS or ORPS , such as mental rotation and selection , might activate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parietal areas . Thus , we conclude that INPS and ORPS are not separate processes but share common cognitive control networks . Although our current findings suggest that the neural mechanisms underlying INPS and ORPS overlap in the IFG , MFG , and IPL , another possible interpretation for this is that the activated IFG , MFG , and IPL was merely caused by task difficulty but not common representations of INPS and ORPS . However , the current study revealed that this is unlikely . We performed a repeated whole - brain analysis by taking RTs ( as a measure of difficulty ) as covariates of no interest . We ob - served nearly the same brain activations as in the original analysis ( Tables 2 and 3 ) . These results imply that task diffi - culty might contribute to our results to some extent . However , it cannot entirely explain our findings . Different neural correlates of insight and ordinary problem solving In addition to common neural correlates , the present study also showed differences between the neural correlates of INPS and ORPS ( Table 3 ; Figs . 3 and 4 ) , which is in line with previous studies ( Ohlsson 1992 ; Newell and Simon 1972 ; Wu et al . 2013 ) . For instance , ORPS has been described as taking a stepwise route through a well - defined problem space ( Newell and Simon 1972 ) . However , INPS requires additional processes including making fundamental changes to the initial representation of a problem and overcoming one ’ s implicit prior knowledge ( Ohlsson 1992 ) . Thus , problem solving in various domains might recruit different neural mechanisms . We will focus on the roles of each area responsible for INPS and or ORPS in detail . We found that INPS induced greater activations in the bi - lateral AG , right ACC , right STG , and left PCUN than ORPS . Previous studies suggested that the ACC represents a core region of conflict regulation and emotional function ( Fan et al . 2007 ; Huang et al . 2015 ; Radua et al . 2012 ) . The AG is supposed to be involved in mental manipulating and rea - soning ( Seghier et al . 2010 ; Seghier 2013 ) . The STG is re - sponsible for spatial awareness , object - related exploration , and forming comprehensive associations ( Ellison et al . 2004 ; Karnath 2001 ; Qiu et al . 2008 ) . The PCUN has been sug - gested to be involved in mental imagery , goal - directed ac - tions , and shifting attention between different object features ( Cavanna and Trimble 2006 ; Hebscher et al . 2018 ) . These results were in line with several previous behavioral and neu - roimaging studies ( Ash et al . 2009 ; Bowden and Jung - Beeman 2007 ; Huang et al . 2018 ; Jung - Beeman et al . 2004 ; Knoblich et al . 1999 ; Kounios and Beeman 2009 ; Luo and Niki 2003 ; Lin et al . 2018 ; Subramaniam et al . 2009 ; Tang et al . 2015 ; Wu et al . 2013 ) . For instance , accumulated evi - dence showed that INPS recruits processes to break mental Fig . 4 Activation maps derived from the interaction analysis ( threshold : voxel - level uncorrected p < 0 . 001 and cluster - level FWE - corrected p < 0 . 05 ) . ORPS elicits greater activations in the bilateral MFG , bilateral IFG , left IPL , left HIP , left ITG , and right MOG / SPL / FG compared to INPS . The detailed information for these brain regions is listed in Table 3 . Abbreviations : ORPS , ordinary problem solving ; INPS , insight problem solving ; OCDL , ordinary chunk decomposition - low difficult level ; OCDH , ordinary chunk decomposition - high difficult level ; CCDL , crea - tive chunk decomposition - low creative level ; CCDH , creative chunk decomposition - high creative level ; MFG , middle frontal gyrus ; IPL , in - ferior parietal lobe ; IFG , inferior frontal gyrus ; HIP , hippocampus ; ITG , inferior temporal gyrus ; MOG , middle occipital gyrus ; SPL , superior parietal gyrus ; FG , fusiform gyrus Brain Imaging and Behavior sets , explore creative methods , and establish targeted associa - tions ( Bowden and Jung - Beeman 2007 ; Subramaniam et al . 2009 ) . People had surprising feelings when they find solutions to creative problems , which was known as the “ Aha ! ” expe - rience ( Kounios and Beeman 2009 ) . Other researches have shown that shifting attention is essential to creative solutions ( Lin et al . 2018 ; Wu et al . 2013 ) . Besides , the ACC , STG , AG and PCUN were usually reported in the neuroimaging studies of INPS ( Jung - Beeman et al . 2004 ; Luo and Niki 2003 ; Tang et al . 2015 ; Huang et al . 2018 ) . Considering the brain func - tions of ACC , AG , STG , and PCUN and the mental processes of INPS , activations of these brain regions in our study may indicate a relationship between INPS and conflict monitoring , breaking mental sets , target - related searching , shifting atten - tion , forming associations , and “ Aha ! ” experience . In the creative chunk decomposition , we suppose that the ACC might involve controlling the uncorrelated chunk repre - sentations , decomposing the chunk in a target direction , and creating the “ Aha ! ” experience . The STG and AG might be involved in exploring the creative chunk decomposition and forming the novel representations . The PCUN might deploy attentional resources for breaking mental sets and cognitive manipulations . These findings are partly in line with previous neuroimaging insight studies ( Jung - Beeman et al . 2004 ; Luo et al . 2004 ; Qiu et al . 2010 ; Subramaniam et al . 2009 ; Zhang et al . 2011 ) . For instance , previous studies employed a partic - ular problem ( i . e . , compound remote associates ) to study INPS and observed ACC and STG activations ( Jung - Beeman et al . 2004 ; Subramaniam et al . 2009 ) . With other INPS paradigms , including the Chinese logogriphs task and the ambiguous sentence comprehension task , the ACC and PCUN were found to be involved in INPS ( Luo et al . 2004 ; Qiu et al . 2010 ) . In addition , the ACC , AG , STG , and PCUN are key re - gions of the DMN ( Buckner et al . 2008 ; Boccia et al . 2015 ; Raichle et al . 2001 ) . This implies that the DMN may play an Table 3 Clusters showing significant differences in activations in the interaction effect between INPS and ORPS ( voxel - level threshold of p < . 0001 , with FWE - corrected p < 0 . 05 for cluster level ) .

Consistent with these findings , previ - ous studies showed that the DMN involves different creativity performances ( Bechtereva et al . 2004 ; Ellamil et al . 2012 ; Howard - Jones et al . 2005 ) . Specifically , parts of the DMN , such as the AG and STG , were found to be recruited while participants were performing verbal creativity tasks ( Bechtereva et al . 2004 ) . Moreover , Ellamil et al . ( 2012 ) found activations of the DMN during visual creativity tasks . Therefore , INPS might recruit more symbolic processes in the DMN than ORPS . Furthermore , we found that ORPS elicited greater activa - tions in the left ITG , left HIP , and right MOG / SPL / FG than INPS . The ITG has been found to be involved in visual word recognition and visual encoding ( Heim et al . 2009 ; Hermes et al . 2015 ) . The MOG plays an important role in spatial visual tasks and is related to the detailed analysis of visual patterns ( Renier et al . 2010 ; Wu et al . 2013 ; Wen et al . 2017 ) . The FG is considered a key region for high - level vision such as face perception and object recognition ( Keller et al . 2017 ; Weiner and Zilles 2016 ) . The SPL is involved in top - down attentional orienting ( Hopfinger et al . 2000 ; Tang et al . 2015 ) . The role of the HIP has been suggested to be related to long - term memory retrieval ( Stern et al . 1996 ) . Notably , the explanations of the brain regions mentioned above were based on the previous studies . However , there were some evidences that the expla - nations of these brain regions could be used to explain ORPS . For example , in the present study , ORPS operations felt fa - miliar and intuitive to participants in contrast to INPS opera - tions . Participants could use their existing knowledge to solve the current ordinary chunk decomposition task , since they were made aware of the task requirements before the experi - ment . For instance , it is obvious and easy for participants to change an existing character into a target character through removing a radical or stroke based on the visual features of the character . This suggests that ordinary chunk decomposi - tion can be executed using the visual - perceptual characteris - tics of the chunks , and that such tasks do not require a more detailed analysis or higher levels of reasoning . Considering the brain functions of the ITG , HIP and MOG / SPL / FG and the mental processes of ORPS ( ordinary chunk decomposi - tion ) , activations of these brain regions in our study may in - dicate a relationship between ORPS and visual perception . Thus , the activations in the ITG , HIP , and MOG / SPL / FG might imply that ORPS recruits more visuospatial attention and visual - perceptual processes , but not more symbolic processes than INPS . Specifically , we speculate that the ITG , FG , and MOG are involved in recognizing and analyzing the visual patterns of the characters , while the SPL serves to sustain attention on task goals in ordinary chunkdecomposition . Moreover , theactivationsintheHIPcouldbe related to the retrieval of existing knowledge in order to decompose the chunk in an ordinary way . The ROI analysis complements the whole - brain analysis and provides further evidence for the relationship between INPS and ORPS . In the present study , both analyses detected similar activations within the IFG for both INPS and ORPS , which suggests that the two types of problem solving have overlapping neural mechanisms . At the same time , the greater Table 4 Clusters showing significant activations in INPS , ORPS and their interaction effect in the ROI analysis .

Limitations and future directions First , we are aware that parts of our findings are not in line with several earlier studies ( Luo and Niki 2003 ; Luo and Knoblich 2007 ; MacKay et al . 1998 ; Zhao et al . 2013 ) . These studies indicated that the HIP is involved in INPS . For instance , Luo and Niki ( 2003 ) found that the HIP was activated during INPS by using Japanese riddles as stimuli . A possible explanation for this inconsistency may be the dif - ferent experimental paradigms used in these studies . In this riddle - solving study ( Luo and Niki 2003 ) , the riddles were first presented to the participants , and , if they failed to resolve them , they were presented with the correct answers . The cre - ative event was defined as the difference between the first judgment “ I do not know the answer ” and , after the provided answer , the conclusion “ I can understand the meaning ” . The increased activity of the HIP might thus be associated with the activation of extensive semantic networks rather than the in - sight problem solving , since participants might need more existing knowledge to comprehend the meaning of the pro - vided answers . Consistent with this explanation , in our study , ORPS , which might recruit more existing knowledge , showed higher HIP activations than INPS . However , this explanation regarding the activation of the HIP in INPS is still controver - sial . In the future , further studies are required to clarify this issue . Second , for the behavioural data , we noticed that the CRs of the CCD condition are high ( over 80 % ) , which means a little easier for participants to operate the creative chunk decomposition . It is , thus , questionable whether this operation causes actual insight events or not . In fact , before the experi - ment , we performed independent measures to test whether the CCD condition is insightful or not . Our results confirmed that CCD operations are perceived as creative ( 3 . 13 ± 0 . 37 ) , and can induce “ Aha ! ” experience ( 3 . 02 ± 0 . 38 ) on a 5 - point cre - ativity or “ Aha ! ” experience scale ( see Supplementary Material ) . Third , several studies indicated that reliability of task - based fMRI is not high ( Elliott et al . 2019 ; Xing and Zuo 2018 ; Zuo and Xing 2014 ; Zuo et al . 2019 ) . In the study , we used a Chinese character chunk decomposition paradigm to induce INPS . Result showed that INPS could involve me - dial prefrontal cortex , middle frontal gyrus , inferior frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobe . Similarly , using Chinese char - acter chunk decomposition paradigms , previous studies found that similar brain regions were activated in INPS ( Huang et al . 2015 ; Luo et al . 2006 ; Tang et al . 2015 ; Wu et al . 2013 ) . Based on the relatively consistent findings from different stud - ies using the Chinese character chunk decomposition , we speculate that reliability of the task employed in this study is relatively high . However , future studies need to directly test the reliability of fMRI activations in the Chinese character chunk decomposition task . Fourth , for the creative chunk de - composition task , in addition to removal of a portion of a character , the successive presentation of the stimulus portions also involved changes in the visual scale of the stimuli . The changes might have an impact on our behavioral and neuro - imaging results . Future studies should use more accurate ma - terials to reduce the impact of changes . Finally , in the future , we should employ different types of ORPS and INPS , such as real - life problem solving , to confirm our findings . Conclusion The present study used functional MRI and a chunk decom - position paradigm to study the common and distinct neural correlates of INPS and ORPS . We found that both INPS and ORPS rely on a core mechanism , involving the frontoparietal cognitive control network ( i . e . , IFG , MFG , and IPL ) . INPS recruited more symbolic processes in the DMN ( i . e . , ACC , STG , AG , and PCUN ) than ORPS , whereas ORPS induced greater activations in more posterior brain regions related to visual perception and attention ( i . e . , MOG , FG , ITG , SPL , and HIP ) than INPS . These findings provide new neural evidence that INPS and ORPS rely on common as well as distinct cog - nitive processes and brain mechanisms .
