Here we show that p21 - activated kinase ( Pak1 ) phosphorylates LIM - kinase at threonine residue 508 within LIM - kinase’s activation loop , and increases LIM - kinase - mediated phosphorylation of the actin - regulatory protein cofilin tenfold in vitro . In vivo , activated Rac or Cdc42 increases association of Pak1 with LIM - kinase ; this association requires structural determinants in both the amino - terminal regulatory and the carboxy - terminal catalytic domains of Pak1 . A catalytically inactive LIM - kinase interferes with Rac - , Cdc42 - and Pak1 - dependent cytoskeletal changes . A Pak1 - specific inhibitor , corresponding to the Pak1 autoinhibitory domain , blocks LIM - kinase - induced cytoskeletal changes . Activated GTPases can thus regulate actin depolymerization through Pak1 and LIM - kinase . he actin cytoskeleton is dynamic , and the rates of polymeriza - tion and depolymerization of actin are important determi - nants of cell motility , cell division and the formation of specialized structures . Actin polymerization drives formation and extension of lamellae at the leading edge of motile cells , while the actin - based molecular motor myosin provides the tractive force necessary for cell movement 1 , 2 . Members of the Rho family of GTPases regulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics by cycling between inactive GDP - bound and active GTP - bound states 3 , 4 . Although crosstalk among family members occurs , each is activated in response to specific environmental signals and each induces specific changes in the actin cytoskeleton : Rho induces assembly of stress fibres and focal adhesions ; Rac induces peripheral actin accumula - tion and membrane ruffling ; Cdc42 induces filopodia ; and both Rac and Cdc42 assemble focal complexes 5 . Several effectors of Rho GTPases have been identified but signal - transduction pathways that link these to the actin cytoskeleton are not completely understood . A number of actin - associated proteins that regulate actin polymerization and depolymerization are potential downstream mediators . The Arp2 / 3 complex binds with high affinity to the pointed ( more slowly growing ) ends of actin filaments , and induces actin filaments to polymerize and elongate from their barbed ( more quickly growing ) ends 6 . WASP , the protein associated with the immune disorder Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome , and related proteins appear to be the principal regulators of Arp2 / 3 - mediated nucleation of actin polymerization 7 . Analysis of actin polymerization in vitro indi - cates synergistic activation of actin polymerization by phosphatidyli - nositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) and GTP g S - bound Cdc42 through their binding to the amino terminus of N - WASP , relieving inhibitory constraints on its carboxy terminus which can then interact with Arp2 / 3 and actin 8 . In addition , Rac and Rho control the severing and nucleation of new actin filaments through gelsolin , whose interac - tion with actin is regulated by PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( ref . 9 ) . Small actin - binding proteins of the cofilin / actin - depolymeriz - ing - factor family are also important regulators of the actin cycle , mediating cleavage and disassembly of actin filaments 10 . They therefore serve as an important downstream control point for cytoskeletal dynamics 11 . LIM - kinase catalyses phosphorylation of an N - terminal serine residue of cofilin , thereby inactivating its F - actin - depolymerizing activity and leading to accumulation of actin filaments and aggregates 12 , 13 . LIM - kinase acts downstream of Rac but is not a direct target of this GTPase 12 , 13 . A protein that may link Rac and Cdc42 with LIM - kinase is the p21 - activated kinase , Pak1 , which , through its Rac - and Cdc42 - binding domain ( PBD ) , binds to and is activated by GTP - bound Rac and Cdc42 ( refs 14 , 15 ) . Pak1 has been localized to regions of cytoskeletal assembly 16 , 17 , and acti - vated forms induce cytoskeletal rearrangements independently of Rac or Cdc42 activation 16 – 19 . Here we tested whether Pak1 could activate LIM - kinase , and used inhibitors of Pak1 and LIM - kinase in vivo to investigate the connections identified in vitro . The results define a signal - transduc - tion pathway in which Pak1 activated by GTP - bound Rac or Cdc42 transphosphorylates and activates LIM - kinase , which in turn effi - ciently catalyses phosphorylation and inactivation of cofilin , result - ing in decreased depolymerization of F - actin . Results Activation of LIM - kinase by Pak1 . We measured LIM - kinase activity in vitro as incorporation of 32 P into serine residue 3 ( Ser 3 ) of cofilin 20 . Addition of a constitutively active Pak1 fused to glutath - ione - S - transferase ( GST ) ( Pak * ) 15 enhanced the rate of LIM - kinase - catalysed phosphorylation of Ser 3 of cofilin 7 . 6 - fold ( Fig . 1a ) . Nei - ther Pak * alone , nor a catalytically inactive LIM - kinase mutant ( D460N ) in the presence of Pak * , caused phosphorylation of cofi - lin . The N - terminal LIM and PDZ domains of LIM - kinase suppress the C - terminal kinase domain and inhibit LIM - kinase - induced cytoskeletal changes 20 . The kinase domain alone of LIM - kinase ( Kd , residues 302 – 647 ) had ~ 2 . 5 - fold greater activity than full - length ( wild - type ) LIM - kinase , and was also activated 7 . 6 - fold by Pak * ( Fig . 1a ) . The stimulatory effects of Pak * on LIM - kinase are thus directly due to effects on the kinase domain . To investigate the mechanism of activation of LIM - kinase by Pak * , we tested the effects on cofilin phosphorylation of several mutations in the kinase domain of LIM - kinase . LIM - kinase con - tains in its activation loop a highly basic 11 - amino - acid insertion ( Arg 495 to Arg 506 ) 21 , 22 preceding a threonine ( Thr 508 ) that is anal - ogous to a regulatory phosphorylation site in other protein T © 1999 Macmillan Magazines Ltd articles 254 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY | VOL 1 | SEPTEMBER 1999 | cellbio . nature . com kinases 23 , 24 . Mutation of Thr 508 to valine ( T508V ) reduced LIM - kinase activity whereas replacement with two glutamic acid residues ( T508EE ) resulted in an active form of LIM - kinase ; neither T508V nor T508EE was activated by Pak * ( Fig . 1b ) . Both deletion and mutation of the 11 - amino - acid basic insert completely disrupted activation of LIM - kinase by Pak * ( Fig . 1b ) . In contrast , mutation of Tyr 507 did not affect LIM - kinase activation by Pak * ( data not shown ) . These results indicate that Pak * may activate LIM - kinase through phosphorylation of Thr 508 , with the basic insert providing the substrate determinants required by Pak1 ( ref . 25 ) . Pak * - mediated phosphorylation of the purified kinase domain ( Kd ) of LIM - kinase coincided with activation of this domain ( Fig . 1c ) . Matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization ( MALDI ) mass spectroscopy identified a shift in relative molecular mass of 80 , 000 ( from 2 , 098 to 2 , 178 ) in the tryptic peptide corresponding to the activation loop of LIM - kinase ( 507 YTVVGNPYWMAPGMINGR ) after phosphorylation of purified Kd by Pak1 . This confirmed that Thr 508 was the site phosphorylated by Pak * . Pak * also phosphor - ylated a catalytically inactive form of Kd ( Kd ( D460N ) ) , but not Kd ( T508EE ) ( data not shown ) . These results , coupled with the low activity of the T508V mutant and loss of LIM - kinase activity upon phosphatase treatment 20 , indicate that phosphorylation of Thr 508 is required for maximal LIM - kinase activity . Protein kinase C b II , protein kinase A and phosphoinositide - dependent protein kinase - 1 were unable to phosphorylate or activate LIM - kinase . Binding of activated Rac or Cdc42 to the N - terminal PBD in Pak1 induces a conformational change that relieves inhibitory con - straints on the C - terminal kinase domain 14 , 15 , 26 . The active Pak1 kinase domain ( amino acids 232 – 504 , Pak - KD ( Kin + ) ) enhanced LIM - kinase activity roughly twofold ( Fig . 2A , a ) . Neither the cata - lytically inactive kinase domain ( Pak - KD ( Kin – ) ( Fig . 2A , a ) nor the full - length catalytically inactive GST – Pak1 ( K299R ) fusion protein ( Fig . 2A , b ) activated LIM - kinase . Although an N - terminal PBD - containing fragment of Pak1 ( Pak1 amino acids 67 – 150 ) alone had no effect , the full - length Pak * activated LIM - kinase more effectively than Pak - KD ( Kin + ) ( Fig . 2A , a ) , indicating that the presence of an intact Pak1 N terminus enhances LIM - kinase activation . Histidine - tagged full - length Pak1 ( wild - type Pak1 ) is not consti - tutively active and remains GTPase dependent for full activity 27 . Wild - type Pak1 alone did not activate LIM - kinase ( Fig . 2B ) . Addi - tion of inactive GDP - bound Cdc42 to wild - type Pak1 activated LIM - kinase ~ 2 - fold whereas active GTP g S - bound Cdc42 activated LIM - kinase ~ 11 - fold , increasing LIM - kinase activity from 5 . 5 – 0 . 4 to 64 – 0 . 9 mol phosphate incorporated per mol enzyme per minute . This is comparable to activities reported for other purified serine / threonine kinases 28 . GTP g S - bound Rac similarly induced Pak1 acti - vation of LIM - kinase activity ( data not shown ) . Thus the GTPases Rac and Cdc42 may be connected with the actin cytoskeleton through the effectors Pak1 and LIM - kinase . Rac / Cdc42 - dependent interaction of Pak1 with LIM - kinase . We used co - immunoprecipitation to investigate in vivo interactions between LIM - kinase and Pak1 . We immunoprecipitated Pak1 from A431 cells , and probed immunoprecipitates with a chicken anti - body directed to an internal peptide in LIM - kinase . The two pro - teins are associated in vivo ( Fig . 3a ) . To identify factors that regulate the association between Pak and LIM - kinase , we used co - transfec - tions in 293 cells . Constitutively activated Rac ( Q61L ) enhanced complex formation between LIM - kinase and Pak , compared with the complex formation induced by inactive Rac ( T17N ) ( Fig . 3b , lanes 1 , 2 ) . The partially activated Pak1 ( H83 , 86L ) mutant , which is defective in Rac and Cdc42 binding 18 , also bound LIM - kinase ( Fig . 3b , lane 3 ) . Pak1 and the kinase domain of LIM - kinase also formed complexes , consistent with the ability of Pak1 to catalyse phospho - rylation and induce activation of Kd . We mapped the sites of interaction between LIM - kinase and Pak1 by binding of 35 S - labelled LIM - kinase to Pak1 fragments expressed as GST fusion proteins ( Fig . 3c ) . LIM - kinase bound spe - cifically to both the N - terminal regulatory and the C - terminal cat - alytic domains of Pak1 . We localized the LIM - kinase - binding region in the Pak1 N terminus to the region between amino acids 67 and 150 , which contains the p21 - binding domain ( amino acids 67 – 86 ) and the autoinhibitory regulatory domain ( amino acids 83 – 149 ) , indicating that binding of Pak 1 to activated Rac or Cdc42 would regulate binding of LIM - kinase to Pak1 . Addition of acti - vated Cdc42 to wild - type Pak1 or to the Pak1 PBD ( amino acids 67 – 150 ) enhanced binding to LIM - kinase , but did not affect the inter - action of LIM - kinase with the non - p21 - binding mutant Pak1 ( H83 , 86L ) or with the Pak1 C - terminal kinase domain ( Fig . 3c ) . In a converse experiment , Cdc42 – GTP g S enhanced binding of soluble wild - type Pak1 to GST – LIM - kinase ( data not shown ) . Thus LIM - kinase binds to a region of Pak1 that includes its autoinhibi - tory domain , and this interaction is increased by Rac or Cdc42 binding to the PBD . In vivo effects on the actin cytoskeleton . To assess the role of LIM - kinase as a downstream mediator of Rac and Cdc42 in actin cytoskeletal reorganization , we co - transfected BHK cells with wild - type LIM - kinase or a catalytically inactive mutant ( D460N ) together with constitutively active Rac ( Q61L ) or Cdc42 ( Q61L ) . Although both Rac and Cdc42 induced a similar peripheral reor - Figure 1 Activation of LIM - kinase by Pak1 in vitro . a , Increased LIM - kinase - catalysed phosphorylation of cofilin in the presence of Pak1 . LIM - kinase activity was measured in the presence or absence of recombinant , constitutively active GST – Pak1 ( Pak * ) . Equal amounts of wild - type ( WT ) , catalytically inactive ( D460N ) or kinase domain only ( Kd ) LIM - kinase were expressed in HEK 293 cells . Cell lysates were added to reaction mixtures containing 20 m M cofilin and [ g - 32 P ] ATP , and 32 P incorporation into cofilin was quantified . b , Requirement of the activation - loop threonine and the basic insert of LIM - kinase for activation by Pak1 .

Expression of wild - type LIM - kinase increased the number and size of peripheral actin fibres . Expression of LIM - kinase ( D460N ) disrupted Rac - and Cdc42 - induced peripheral actin reorganization and Rac - induced membrane ruffling , but did not affect Cdc42 - induced microspike formation . Quantitatively , peripheral reorganization and thickening of actin fibres was observed in ~ 50 % of the cells expressing Cdc42 ( Q61L ) , in ~ 80 % of cells expressing Cdc42 ( Q61L ) plus wild - type LIM - kinase , and in only 5 % of cells expressing Cdc42 ( Q61L ) plus LIM - kinase ( D460N ) . LIM - kinase ( D460N ) did not significantly reduce Cdc42 - induced microspikes in these cells . Like the D460N mutant , catalytically inactive LIM - kinase ( T508V ) also inhibited Rac - induced actin reorganization ( data not shown ) . Together , these data indicate that LIM - kinase may be downstream of Rac - induced cytoskeletal signalling , but mediates only a subset of Cdc42 - induced cytoskeletal changes . To determine whether the LIM - kinase - induced cytoskeletal changes depended on Pak1 activity , we transfected BHK cells with LIM - kinase and the N - terminal autoregulatory domain of Pak1 ( Pak ( 83 – 149 ) ) , which inhibits Pak activity in vivo 26 , 29 . Although con - trol and Pak ( 83 – 149 ) - expressing BHK cells had a very organized actin cytoskeleton , composed of parallel actin fibres , cells expressing LIM - kinase had an exaggerated membrane ruffling phenotype and accumulated large aggregates of actin ( Fig . 5 , compare a , c ) . These changes induced by LIM - kinase presumably reflect severe inhibition of F - actin depolymerization as a result of inactivation of cofilin 12 , 13 , 20 . Co - expression of Pak ( 83 – 149 ) with LIM - kinase resulted in substan - tial inhibition of LIM - kinase - induced cytoskeletal changes ( Fig . 5d ) . Changing Leu 107 to phenylalanine , which inactivates Pak1’s autoinhibitory domain 26 , abolished the ability of the Pak ( 83 – 149 ) autoinhibitor to block LIM - kinase - induced cytoskeletal changes ( Fig . 5 , compare d , e ) . The distribution of actin cytoskeletal pheno - typic changes was scored to provide an assessment of the effects of Pak ( 83 – 149 ) on LIM - kinase - induced changes 20 . When wild - type LIM - kinase and the inactive Pak1 inhibitor Pak1 ( L107F ) were coexpressed , ~ 80 % of the cells exhibited moderate to severe changes in the actin cytoskeleton , consisting of loss of stress fibres and increasing accumulation of aggregates of actin ( 2 + to 4 + , as described in ref . 20 ) . In contrast , when wild - type LIM - kinase and Pak ( 83 – 149 ) were coexpressed , ~ 80 % of the cells exhibited no or minimal actin cytoskeletal changes ( 0 to 1 + ) . These data indicate that LIM - kinase activity is dependent on Pak1 activity in vivo . Figure 2 Requirement of Pak1 activation and kinase activity for regulation of LIM - kinase . A , Requirement for intrinsic kinase activity and an intact N terminus of Pak1 for activation of LIM - kinase . a , Kd - catalysed phosphorylation of cofilin was measured in the presence or absence of GST fusion proteins containing the N - terminal regulatory domain of Pak1 ( Pak ( 67 – 150 ) ) , the active kinase domain of Pak1 ( Pak - KD ( Kin . + ) ) , the catalytically inactive kinase - domain mutant Pak1 ( K299R ) ( Pak - KD ( Kin . – ) ) or Pak * . Relative kinase activity was calculated from linear rates of cofilin phosphorylation and the basal activity of Kd was set to 1 . b , Kinase assays were carried out using wild - type LIM - kinase ( LIMK ) and cofilin in the presence or absence of a constitutively active Pak1 fused to GST ( wild - type Pak1 ) or a catalytically inactive Pak1 mutant , K299R .

Dele - tion of the basic insert abolished activation by Pak1 but did not abolish basal kinase activity in vitro ( Fig . 1b ) . These results indicate a strict requirement for phosphorylation of Thr 508 for in vivo activ - ity of LIM - kinase . Blocking LIM - kinase - induced cytoskeletal changes with the intact , but not the mutant , Pak1 autoinhibitor supports the conclusion that Pak1 activity is essential for LIM - kinase activity in vivo . Inhibition of Rac - and Cdc42 - induced cytoskeletal changes by catalytically inactive LIM - kinase ( D460N ) , coupled with inhibition of LIM - kinase - induced cytoskeletal changes by the Pak1 inhibitor , support the idea that information is transferred from Rac to Pak to LIM - kinase . If this is correct , then dominant - negative LIM - kinase should interfere with Pak1 - induced cytoskeletal changes . The Pak1 ( H83 , 86L ) mutant is constitutively active and induces cytoskeletal changes , including dorsal membrane ruffles , formation of lamellipodia , small actin aggregates , cell polarization and focal - complex formation 17 – 19 . In BHK cells , the prominent phenotypes induced by Pak1 ( H83 , 86L ) include large dorsal ruffles , thickening of actin cables and actin aggregation ( Fig . 6a , b ) . Similar formation of dorsal ruffles that contain Pak1 has been shown to occur on treatment of cells with platelet - derived growth factor and insulin 17 . Addition of wild - type LIM - kinase increased actin aggregation in cells expressing Pak1 ( H83 , 86L ) ( Fig . 6c ) . However , coexpression of dominant - negative LIM - kinase and Pak1 ( H83 , 86L ) blocked both formation of the large dorsal ruffles and the actin aggregation induced by Pak1 ( H83 , 86L ) ( Fig . 6d ) . Because the level of expres - sion of transfected proteins varies within cells of a population , we scored the formation of dorsal ruffles seen with Pak1 ( H83 , 86L ) and the actin aggregation characteristic of LIM - kinase activity in expressor cells to provide an estimate of intrinsic activity in the population 12 , 20 . The dominant - negative LIM - kinase ( D460N ) abol - ished Pak1 ( H83 , 86L ) - induced dorsal ruffles and decreased by 50 % the number of cells exhibiting actin aggregates ( Fig . 6g ) . As previ - ous studies indicated that dominant - negative LIM - kinase blocked the actin cytoskeletal effects induced by wild - type LIM - kinase 12 , 13 , 20 , these results indicate that LIM - kinase mediates some of the cytoskeletal effects of Pak1 . Because Pak1 has been reported to have kinase - independent effects on the cytoskeleton 18 , 19 , we used a catalytically inactive Pak ( H83 , 86L , K299R ) to test whether dominant - negative LIM - kinase ( D460N ) could block these effects . Pak1 ( H83 , 86L , K299R ) caused membrane extensions , but not dorsal or peripheral ruffles , in BHK cells ( Fig . 6e ) . These membrane extensions were not blocked by LIM - kinase ( D460N ) ( Fig . 6f ) . Of cells expressing Pak1 ( H83 , 86L , K299R ) , ~ 50 % exhibited some membrane extensions . This fraction did not change in cells coexpressing both the kinase - inactive Pak1 and the kinase - inactive LIM - kinase . Thus the kinase - independ - ent effects of Pak1 are not dependent on LIM - kinase . Figure 3 Direct interaction of LIM - kinase and Pak1 . a , Association of endogenous Pak1 with LIM - kinase . Pak1 was immunoprecipitated ( IP ) with rabbit polyclonal anti - Pak1 antibody and western blots of immunoprecipitates were probed with chicken anti - LIM - kinase antibody 625 ( ref . 20 ) in the absence or presence of the immunizing peptide ( residues 255 – 271 of human LIM - kinase ) . The peptide reduced the amount of LIM - kinase detected in Pak1 immunoprecipitates by 50 – 60 % . b , Increased binding of Pak1 to LIM - kinase in cells expressing activated Rac . The indicated combinations were transfected into HEK293 cells . The cells were lysed after 48 h and LIM - kinase was immunoprecipitated with the 5079 antibody . The immunoprecipitates were blotted and probed for co - immunoprecipitated Myc - tagged Pak1 with the 9E10 antibody against the Myc tag ( top panel ) . The blot was stripped and reprobed with the chicken anti - LIM - kinase antibody 625 to compare LIM - kinase expression in immunoprecipitates ( second panel ) , and expression of Myc – Pak and Myc – Rac was verified by probing lysates with the 9E10 antibody ( bottom two panels ) . The experiment was repeated four times with similar results . c , Binding of LIM - kinase to regions in the N and C termini of Pak1 . Top , the amino - acid residues present in each fragment of human Pak1 are indicated . The square brackets indicate the Pak1 fragments , and plus or minus symbols indicate qualitatively the relative amount of binding of each fragment to LIM - kinase . Bottom , the indicated GST – Pak1 fragments and mutants were tested for binding to [ 35 S ] methionine - labelled full - length LIM - kinase in vitro . We also tested a non - GTPase - binding full - length Pak1 ( H83 , 86L ) 18 and full - length wild - type Pak1 . GST - bound beads and beads to which GST – Nck was bound ( data not shown ) did not specifically bind LIM - kinase . The right panel shows results obtained from use of GST fusions containing Pak1 ( H83 , 86L ) , an N - terminal fragment of Pak1 ( amino acids 67 – 150 ) containing the p21 - binding domain ( PBD ) and autoinhibitory domain ( AI ) , wild - type Pak1 and the C - terminal catalytic domain ( amino acids 232 – 544 ) to determine the effects of Cdc42 – GTP g S - induced activation of Pak1 on Pak1’s ability to bind LIM - kinase in vitro . GST fusions containing wild - type Pak1 bound 5 % of the input in vitro - translated [ 35 S ] LIM - kinase whereas GST , GST – Nck or GST – Pak ( 147 – 231 ) bound < 0 . 5 % of the input counts .

The two proteins also co - localized with actin aggregates ( data not shown ) . Coexpression of LIM - kinase with green fluores - cent protein did not result in co - localization at membrane ruffles or actin aggregates ( data not shown ) , indicating that the in vivo asso - ciation of LIM - kinase and Pak is specific . These findings , together with the protein - interaction data shown in Fig . 3 , indicate that a Pak1 – LIM - kinase complex may be localized to the area at which actin cytoskeleton rearrangements occur .

Maximal activation by Pak1 requires its intrinsic kinase activ - ity and regions in its N and C termini that may represent one con - stitutive and one regulated binding site . Activation of LIM - kinase depends on phosphorylation of Thr 508 in the activation loop of its kinase domain by Pak1 . Mutational inactivation of the second LIM domain or of the PDZ domain , or deletion of the N - terminal region containing both the LIM and the PDZ domains , increased LIM - kinase activity in vivo 20 . Moreover , the N terminus inhibited activity of the kinase domain of LIM - kinase . Relief of inhibitory constraints imposed by the N terminus is thus necessary for full activation of LIM - kinase , implying that regulatory mechanisms in addition to Pak1 control LIM - kinase activity . In agreement with the findings of refs 12 , 13 , LIM - kinase appears to mediate actin cytoskeletal responses to Rac . The time course of insulin - induced activation of LIM - kinase is reported to parallel that of insulin - induced membrane ruffling , a process dependent on Rac 13 . The time course of insulin - induced activation of Pak1 is similar 30 . These data are consistent with ligand - dependent regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics through a Rac ﬁ Pak ﬁ LIM - kinase pathway but , because responses are localized within the cell , techniques to assess local changes in activity will need to be developed to order physiological responses precisely . Moreover , although GTP - bound Rac and Cdc42 both activate Pak1 , catalytically inactive LIM - kinase blocked only a part of the morphological response to Cdc42 : Cdc42 - induced microspikes persisted , consistent with the idea that distinct signalling pathways mediate the specific morphological responses to each of the Rho - family GTPases 5 . Our results confirm those of ref . 12 but also indicate that only a subset of the cytoskeletal responses to Cdc42 is mediated by LIM - kinase . Cdc42’s effects on microspike for - mation may be mediated by distinct pathways including effects of N - WASP on nucleation of actin polymerization 31 . Pak1 has dramatic effects on cytoskeletal dynamics and Pak1 function is required for both fibroblast 32 and endothelial - cell motil - ity ( W . B . Kiosees , R . H . Daniels , C . Otey , G . M . Bokoch and M . A . Schwartz , unpublished observations ) , as well as for formation of neurites 19 . There is evidence that Pak1 can regulate the actin – myosin cytoskeleton both through N - terminal - interacting proteins and by phosphorylating specific substrates . For example , it can modulate cell contractility through phosphorylation and inhibition of myosin - light - chain kinase 33 . Previous work 18 showed that , upon transient overexpression in fibroblasts , Pak1 ( H83 , 86L ) induced cell polarization accompanied by peripheral and dorsal membrane ruf - fling . When Pak1 catalytic function was inactivated , cells failed to polarize , and peripheral , but never dorsal , ruffling was seen . These results led to the conclusion that Pak1 could induce ruffling in the absence of kinase activity . More recent work 32 using cell lines in which Pak1 expression could be carefully controlled established that Pak1 ( H83 , 86L ) induced polarized ruffles associated with direc - tional cell movement . In contrast , the catalytically inactive version induced random ruffling and the cells were unable to undergo directed migration . Interestingly , in these same studies , low - level expression of catalytically activated Pak1 ( T423E ) also induced a polarized ruffling phenotype . Our results , obtained using BHK cells , support these findings . We observed that , although expression of Pak1 ( H83 , 86L ) induced extensive dorsal ruffling and actin thick - ening , this phenotype was almost totally absent in the presence of the kinase - inactive version of the Pak1 ( H83 , 86L ) mutant . Instead , this mutant caused the formation of membrane extensions that were insensitive to the expression of a dominant - negative form of LIM - kinase . Our present view is that Pak1 can induce ruffling by at least two mechanisms : a preferred , physiologically relevant pathway that requires the kinase function and which is important for directed cell motility , and a second mechanism that is revealed by the catalyti - cally inactive Pak1 . Our data establish that LIM - kinase is an impor - tant mediator of the preferred pathway . LIM - kinase acts to promote and stabilize actin structures formed in response to Pak1 or other cytoskeletal effectors of Rac and Cdc42 . Our results thus define a signal - transduction pathway through which GTP - bound Rac ( and Cdc42 ) activate Pak1 to allow it to form a complex with , and phosphorylate , LIM - kinase . Activated LIM - kinase catalyses phosphorylation and consequent inactivation of cofilin . Inhibition of actin depolymerization represents an essen - tial control point in the overall cycle of actin polymerization / depo - lymerization , resulting in cytoskeletal changes 11 . One important pathway for transmission of extracellular signals to the actin cytoskeleton is through the Rac / Cdc42 ﬁ Pak1 ﬁ LIM - kinase ﬁ cofi - lin cascade . Signalling through the WASP family of proteins , which primarily affect actin polymerization 7 , 8 , must be coordinated with effects on actin depolymerization to provide the high degree of res - olution of cell responses observed in response to extracellular sig - nals . For example , responses to Cdc42 would probably induce actin cytoskeletal changes by coordinately stimulating nucleation of actin polymerization through N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 , and blocking depo - lymerization through Pak1 - and LIM - kinase - mediated inactivation of cofilin . h Methods Preparation of LIM - kinase and Pak proteins . Cell lysates of transiently transfected HEK293 cells expressing either wild - type , catalytically inactive dominant - negative ( D460N ) , phosphorylation - site mutant ( T508V ) , catalytically active phosphorylation - site mutant ( - EE ) , or basic - insert - deletion mutant ( - del ) LIM - kinase - 1 ( ref . 20 ) were prepared 60 – 72 h post - transfection , lysed in PBS with 0 . 25 % Triton - X100 , mixed with glycerol to 25 % , and frozen at – 80 (cid:176) C . The purified kinase domain of LIM - kinase ( Kd ) was prepared by cloning complementary DNA encoding the kinase domain ( amino acids 302 – 647 ) of human LIM - kinase - 1 into the baculovirus expression vector pAcGHLT ( Pharmingen ) . The detergent soluble supernatant from infected SF21 cells was bound to glutathione – agarose beads and digested with thrombin for 1 . 5 h according to the manufacturer’s protocols ( Pharmingen ) . Protein was combined with glycerol to 25 % , and stored at – 80 (cid:176) C . All Pak1 constructs were expressed and purified as described 15 , 26 . Kinase assays . In vitro kinase reactions were run as described 20 using 200 m M [ g - 32 P ] ATP , and 32 P incorporation into trichloroacetic acid insoluble protein was measured . Kinase activity was adjusted on the basis of protein expression level , and quantified by chemiluminescence imaging using Molecular Dynamics ( BioRad ) hardware and software . Phosphorylated cofilin accounted for > 95 % of the incorporated radioactivity . All assays were done in triplicate and repeated at least six times with similar results . Kinase assays for Fig . 1a , b were done using detergent - soluble ( 0 . 25 % Triton - X100 ) HEK293 cell lysates 72 h after transfection . All Figure 7 Co - localization of Pak and LIM - kinase with actin at membrane ruffles . Cos - 7 cells were transfected with wild - type LIM - kinase and Myc - tagged wild - type Pak1 ( Pak ) .

Purified Kd was combined with stoichiometrically equivalent amounts of wild - type Pak1 and either Cdc42 or Rac that had been loaded and activated with the non - hydrolysable GTP analogue GTP - g S as described 15 . A mutant cofilin , with the Ser 3 residue replaced by an alanine , was not phosphorylated by LIM - kinase 20 . Kinase reactions for SDS – PAGE analysis were stopped by addition of Laemmli sample buffer and samples visualized by autoradiography after SDS – PAGE on 13 % gels . MALDI mass spectrophotometry . Mass - spectrophotometry analysis of phosphorylated LIM - kinase was adapted from ref . 34 . GST – Kd expressed from baculovirus was phosphorylated in kinase reaction buffer with a substoichiometric amount of Pak * and digested with 1 . 5 m g ml – 1 modified trypsin ( Promega ) The solubilized , digested proteolytic fragments were loaded on a MALDI mass spectrophotometer and analysed for 80K shifts in known proteolytic fragments . Co - immunoprecipitation of Pak1 and LIM - kinase . HEK292 cells transfected with LIM - kinase , Myc – Pak1 and Myc – Rac were prepared as described for kinase reactions .
