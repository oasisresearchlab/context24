I NTRODUCTION Autonomous vehicles have been successfully applied in particular scenarios like logistics centers , industrial parks , and container terminals to achieve large - scale commodity transportation [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] . Robotaxis , which may be the first application for carrying people , are different from current human - driven taxis ( HDTs ) [ 3 ] : 1 ) The former is more controllable and conducive than the latter to building an intelligent transportation system . It is easy to integrate advanced technologies such as big data , cloud computing , and artificial intelligence to achieve efficient and low - carbon services ; 2 ) The number of robotaxis that are used for dispatch can change dynamically according to the number of orders , while the number of HDTs is usually determined and each driver needs to have orders ; 3 ) In the current major ride - hailing platforms , e . g . , Uber , Lyft , and DiDi [ 4 ] , an HDT driver maximizes personal benefit , which cannot guarantee to maximize global profit . Therefore , this work studies a robotaxi dispatch problem ( RDP ) , which is more conducive to maximizing the total profit of the platform and customers . A vehicle routing problem ( VRP ) is a subproblem of taxi dispatch , which is significant in obtaining taxi routes after receiving orders . A fundamental goal of the VRP is to obtain vehicle routes serving all customers with the minimum travel cost [ 5 ] . Some studies model it as a single - objective optimization problem . For example , Feng et al . [ 6 ] propose an explicit evolutionary multitasking algorithm to solve a capacitated VRP , which minimizes travel cost . To speed up the optimization of the VRP , the same authors propose an approach by transferring knowledge learned from the past - solved VRPs [ 7 ] . Some studies model the VRP as a multi - objective optimization problem . For example , Wang et al . [ 8 ] study a multi - objective periodic VRP with time windows to minimize the number , total travel distance , waiting time , and delay of vehicles . They propose a hybrid multi - objective memetic algorithm for solving it . Li et al . [ 9 ] propose a multi - objective VRP model under the pandemic scenarios , which minimizes prevention cost caused by viral tests and quarantine while traveling in pandemic situations and travel cost . As combinatorial optimization problems , the VRP and its variants are widely studied and applied in many practical application areas . When customers take a taxi , a carpooling mode helps solve traffic congestion and effectively reduces economic pressure on traveling [ 10 ] . Many studies build carpooling as an optimization problem and solve a carpool service problem ( CSP ) by utilizing the genetic algorithm ( GA ) [ 11 ] and particle swarm optimization ( PSO ) algorithm [ 12 ] . Huang et al . [ 13 ] design a CSP optimization model with time windows and use an evolutionary algorithm to solve it . A ridesharing potential is improved by dividing a road network into distinct partitions [ 14 ] and considering the increase in the driving distance caused by a carpool detour [ 15 ] . However , these studies seldom consider reducing the number of taxis being dispatched and maximizing the total interest of taxis and passengers . Hence , we propose a method to solve a RDP , which reduces the cost of the robotaxi platform and maximizes the total interest of robotaxis and passengers . In recent years , people have suffered from the harm of respiratory viruses [ 16 ] . Some research shows that reducing contact among passengers can decrease the risk of contracting the novel coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) [ 17 ] . Hence , we combine the pandemic and other factors ( e . g . , the number , waiting time , and driving distance of the robotaxis ) and design a dispatch model for the robotaxis . The model can effectively respond to the pandemic by reducing contact among 2023 IEEE International Conference on Systems , Man , and Cybernetics ( SMC ) October 1 - 4 , 2023 , Oahu , Hawaii , USA 979 - 8 - 3503 - 3702 - 0 / 23 / $ 31 . 00 ©2023 IEEE 5154 2023 I EEE I n t e r n a t i o n a l C o n f e r e n c e o n S y s t e m s , M a n , a nd C y b e r n e t i c s ( S M C ) | 979 - 8 - 3503 - 3702 - 0 / 23 / $ 31 . 00 © 2023 I EEE | D O I : 10 . 1109 / S M C 53992 . 2023 . 10394187 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE .

The major contributions of this paper are as follows : 1 ) It studies a RDP in carpooling and establishes a multi - objective optimization model to maximize the total profit of the robotaxis and customers . Besides , the model considers the severity of the pandemic and decreases the infection rate by reducing contact among passengers . 2 ) It designs an NSGA - TS algorithm and proposes a dynamic integer encoding method to solve the problem . Three operations are used to speed up the convergence of the algorithm . The rest of this paper is organized as follows . Section II presents the model for the robotaxi dispatch . Section III describes the NSGA - TS algorithm in detail . In Section IV , the experimental results are presented and analyzed . Finally , Section V gives the conclusion and discusses future work . II . P ROBLEM D ESCRIPTION AND F ORMULATION A . Problem Description When the robotaxi dispatch system receives several orders , it assigns robotaxis and plans a route for each robotaxi that gets the orders . The orders’ information is transmitted to the application server by the mobile platform . The control center receives orders’ information and sends a message to the road - side unit to schedule robotaxis . Then the robotaxis finish the service following the planned routes . The contact by taking a robotaxi in a carpooling mode increases the risk of spreading the virus . Therefore , this paper proposes a robotaxi dispatch strategy to reduce the infection rate , which takes the minimum number , driving distance , and waiting time of robotaxis as objectives of the problem . The number of robotaxis refers to the number of robotaxis that are used for dispatch ; the driving distance refers to the total distance from the origin of the robotaxi to the destination of the last passenger when it receives multiple orders from the dispatch system ; the waiting time refers to the time that a robotaxi waits for passengers when it arrives at the origin of an order earlier than the reservation time . Besides , contact frequency is an indicator for passengers in an order , which refers to the total number of passengers from other orders contacted by the passengers . Several assumptions are presented as follows : ( a ) All orders are reservation orders . ( b ) All passengers can arrive at the origin on time according to the scheduled starting time , and the orders’ status cannot be changed ( i . e . , passengers do not cancel orders or change trips ) during scheduling . ( c ) A delay of a robotaxi is not allowed . ( d ) The number of seats in an order does not exceed the capacity of any robotaxis .

( f ) The robotaxi can obtain real - time traffic conditions and accurately predict the phase of the traffic lights when it passes at the intersection . ( g ) The capacity of the robotaxi can be different . ( h ) The contact of passengers belonging to one order is not considered . B . Mathematical Model This paper uses a sequence containing all the paths of robotaxis as a decision variable . The decision variable is recorded as X = ( σ 1 , σ 2 , … , σ m ) , where σ i is a path sequence representing a driving route of the robotaxi i . m and n denote the total number of robotaxis and orders , respectively . The path sequence can be described as a directed graph , where vertices and edges represent locations and directions , respectively . There are three robotaxis and five orders in Fig . 1 , where blue and red represent the origin p j and destination d j of orders , respectively , and black represents the origin o i of the robotaxis . The dashed green lines represent the robotaxi path without carpooling , and the solid black lines represent paths with carpooling . The positions in path sequence σ i are divided into two categories : origin locations of robotaxis and reservation locations of orders , where the reservation location of the order includes the origin and destination . The first position in the path sequence σ i is the origin of the robotaxi , and others are the origin or destination of the order . σ i ( k ) is defined as follows : , 1 ( ) or , 1 i i j j o k k p d k σ =  =  >  ( 1 ) Equation ( 2 ) represents the contact frequency 𝑐𝑐 𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖 of each order , where s k represent the number of seats required by the order j . If the passengers in order j and order k ( k ≠ j ) take a robotaxi i at the same time , passengers in order j contact all the passengers in order k . ij k c s = ∑ ( 2 ) We set the maximum detour rate Δ to guarantee high - quality ride services [ 19 ] . The shortest path distance of passengers in the order j is 𝑙𝑙 𝑗𝑗 , i . e . , the shortest distance between the origin and destination . The actual distance l j of passengers in the order j is the real distance from the origin to the destination . The detour rate δ j of passengers in order j is defined as follows : j j j j l l l δ − = ( 3 ) Objective function ( 4 ) represents the driving distance of the robotaxi to complete the service of orders , where 𝑙𝑙 𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 denotes the distance between the position k and the next position k + 1 in the path sequence σ i , and | σ i | denotes the total number of positions in the sequence σ i ( i . e . , the length of the sequence σ i ) . The objective function ( 5 ) represents the total contact frequency of passengers . The objective function ( 6 ) represents the number of robotaxis that are used for a dispatch . The objective function ( 7 ) represents the average waiting time of robotaxis , where 𝜏𝜏 𝑗𝑗𝑠𝑠 is the scheduled starting time of passengers in the order j , and 𝑡𝑡 𝑗𝑗𝑠𝑠 is the time when the robotaxi arrives at the origin of order j . 1 1 1 , 1 1 min i k i m i i k f l σ σ − = > = = ∑ ∑ ( 4 ) 5155 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE .

To get a feasible path sequence and provide high - quality service to passengers , we present some constraints for robotaxis to serve passengers as follows . a ) Transfer Constraint : When a robotaxi provides a service to passengers , it must arrive at the origin σ i ( k 1 ) to pick up passengers and then take them to the destination σ i ( k 2 ) : 1 2 k k < ( 8 ) where σ i ( k 1 ) is the origin , and σ i ( k 2 ) is the destination of passengers in a certain order . b ) Matching Constraint : Passengers in order j are served once and only once : ( ) ( ) , 1 f is an origin if is a des tinati o 1 , i 1 n , i i m kij i u k k σ σ =  = − ∑ ( 9 ) where 𝑢𝑢 𝑖𝑖 , 𝑗𝑗𝑘𝑘 ∈ { 1 , 0 , − 1 } . 𝑢𝑢 𝑖𝑖 , 𝑗𝑗𝑘𝑘 = 1 , if the order j is assigned to the robotaxi i and σ i ( k ) is an origin ; 𝑢𝑢 𝑖𝑖 , 𝑗𝑗𝑘𝑘 = − 1 , if the order j is assigned to the robotaxi i and σ i ( k ) is a destination ; and 𝑢𝑢 𝑖𝑖 , 𝑗𝑗𝑘𝑘 = 0 , if the order j is not assigned to the robotaxi i . c ) Capacity Constraint : The actual number of passengers per robotaxi does not exceed its capacity : , 2 k zi j j i z u s c = ≤ ∑ , i D ∈ , } 2 , 3 , { | | , i k σ ∈ … ( 10 ) Additionally , the set of robotaxis and orders are D = { 1 , 2 , … , m } and R = { 1 , 2 , … , n } , respectively . The seat demand of the order j cannot exceed the capacity of robotaxi i : j i s c ≤ , i D ∈ , j R ∈ ( 11 ) d ) Service Quality Constraint : The detour rate of each order does not exceed the maximum detour rate Δ : j δ < ∆ , j R ∈ ( 12 ) e ) Time Constraint : The arrival time 𝑡𝑡 𝑗𝑗𝑠𝑠 of the robotaxi to the passengers’ origin in the order j cannot be later than its scheduled starting time 𝜏𝜏 𝑗𝑗𝑠𝑠 : s s j j t τ≤ , j R ∈ ( 13 ) III . P ROPOSED A LGORITHM Intelligent optimization algorithms are usually adopted to solve multi - objective problems , such as NSGA - II [ 18 ] and MOEA / D [ 20 ] . The RDP in this paper is a multi - objective problem . We adopt integer encoding to solve it and design three operations based on the NSGA - II algorithm . Besides , the Pareto optimal solutions may have different values each objective function , which makes it difficult to choose a unique solution in the Pareto solution set . Hence , we present a two - stage NSGA - II algorithm named NSGA - TS . Algorithm 1 consists of two stages . In the first stage , three operations are designed to realize the evolution of the population and generate the Pareto optimal solution set . The second stage determines a unique solution from those Pareto optimal solutions according to the risk levels . Algorithm 1 NSGA - TS Algorithm Parameters : population size φ , maximum iteration count G , risk level L and the probabilities of the three operations ; Calculate the distance between each position ; Initialize the population Ω 0 ; Calculate the values of objective functions f 1 - f 4 of population Ω 0 ; g = 0 ; While g < G Change the position of two codes except the first code between two subsequences , as shown in Fig . 2 ( a ) ; Exchange all codes except the first one between two subsequences , as shown in Fig . 2 ( b ) ; Exchange two codes in a subsequence , as shown in Fig . 2 ( c ) ; Generate offspring population ; Merge parent population and offspring population ; Calculate f 1 - f 4 ; Fast nondominated sort on the individuals ; Calculate the crowding distance of individuals ; Select elite individuals ; Generate new population Ω g + 1 ; g = g + 1 ; End Gain Pareto solution set ; Set risk level L ; Select a solution from Pareto solution set according to L ; Return the unique optimal solution . A . Population Initialization The encoding method directly affects the efficiency of the proposed algorithm . We adopt integer encoding , and a feasible solution is represented by a sequence with the total length being m + 2 n , which includes m subsequences representing the driving route of a robotaxi . In each subsequence , the first code represents the origin of the robotaxi and takes an integer from [ 1 , m ] , and others indicate the origin or destination of the order , where the range of the origin and destination of the order are in the range [ 1 , n ] and [ n + 1 , 2 n ] , respectively . The high diversity of solutions is necessary to avoid falling into local optimum and obtain high - quality solutions . We randomly initialize the population and obtain feasible solutions that satisfy the constraints . Each individual in the population represents a feasible solution and consists of m subsequences . Orders are randomly assigned to the robotaxis until all passengers are served . B . Three Operations According to the characteristics of the RDP , we design two updated operations to generate new individuals . Its main advantage is that the small - scale updates are parallel to the large - scale updates . The first one is the operation of local order change , moving the numbers of the origin and destination of an order from one subsequence to another subsequence , as shown in Fig . 2 ( a ) , i . e . , the matching of robotaxis and orders is locally adjusted under the premise of obeying constraints . The second operation exchanges all orders of two robotaxis , as shown in Fig . 2 ( b ) , which aims to search for the robotaxi whose origin is closest to the origin of the first order . Both operations are equivalent to crossover operators in genetic operations but are self - crossover . The mutation operation in GA can usually update individuals without interacting with others . An exchange operation is a strategy in which individuals are updated independently , as shown in Fig . 2 ( c ) , which is used to implement the route planning of robotaxi . The operation guarantees the local search capability of proposed method , and it can prevent the proposed algorithm from falling into the loc - 5156 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE .

Operations . al convergence state . C . Selection Rules of Unique Solution A Pareto optimal solution set is obtained when solving the RDP using multi - objective optimization algorithms . To ensure the uniqueness of the solution , we propose an operation to select a unique solution in the Pareto optimal solution set . For example , three solutions are in the optimal solution set , as shown in Fig . 3 . Table I provides the four objective functions’ values corresponding to the three solutions and their risk level L , which represents different selections obtained by calculating fitness F under different risk levels . The driving distance ( DD ) of robotaxis , contact frequency ( CF ) , the number of robotaxis used ( NRU ) , and waiting time ( WT ) of robotaxis are denoted by f 1 - f 4 , respectively . The smaller the value of L , the higher the risk level . The unique solution is selected according to the risk level from the Pareto optimal solution set . The objective functions’ values are normalized , and then the solution is selected that F is the maximum . In ( 14 ) , the risk level L is set according to the proportion of the population infected with the virus in society ; f k is normalized value of the objective function ; 𝑤𝑤 𝐿𝐿 , 𝑘𝑘 is the weight of each objective function designed according to the risk level . 4 , 1 1 max L k k k F w f = = ∑ ( 14 ) In the NSGA - TS algorithm , these operations aim to explore feasible solutions and avoid the local optimum . These operations greatly improve the quality and diversity of the solutions obtain ed and help gain high - quality solutions . IV . S IMULATION R ESULTS AND A NALYSIS A . Experiment Setting In order to obtain the instance of our proposed model , this work extends the taxi dataset in Manhattan , New York [ 21 ] . The map of Manhattan is shown in Fig . 4 4 . We use the Manhattan distance as the distance between two places because most streets are one - way in Manhattan . The average speed of the robotaxi while driving is set to 30km / h .

We divide the region into four subregions equally based on the longitude range . The robotaxi can serve the order if and only if the origins of both the robotaxi and the order are in the same subregion . For each subregion , the algorithm is used to realize the robotaxi dispatch in the next 20 minutes . Besides , the number of people choosing to travel by robotaxis may vary in different time slots , so we conduct experiments on the order data in the four time slots of 00 : 00 - 00 : 20 , 08 : 00 - 08 : 20 , 14 : 00 - 14 : 20 , and 18 : 00 - 18 : 20 , and set the same probability for different risk levels that are designed based on the proportion of infected people . After experimental test , we set the values of parameters : the population size is 30 ; the maximum number of iterations is 400 ; the probabilities of the three operations are 0 . 3 , 0 . 2 , and 0 . 8 , respectively . To verify the feasibility of our proposed model and the effectiveness of the NSGA - TS algorithm , we compare our results with those obtained by NSGA - II and MOEA / D . All algorithms are implemented in MATLAB ; the compiler version is MATLAB R2022a . The operating environment is Windows 11 with 12th Gen Inter ( R ) Core ( TM ) i7 - 12700H CPU ( 2 . 30GHz / 16 . 00GB RAM ) . B . Analysis of Experimental Results In this paper , the NSGA - TS is used to obtain the Pareto optimal solution set of the problem . Fig . 5 shows that the objective functions’ values of the optimal solution set are reduced , especially the driving distance and contact frequency . In Fig . 5 ( b ) , the driving distance and contact frequency are negatively correlated . An increase in the NRU reduces the probability of passengers carpooling together , which decreases the CF . In addition , the robotaxi may arrive at the origin of the order in advance , which increases the WT . The four boxplots in Fig . 6 show the values of objective functions for the initial population and the Pareto optimal solution set . The NSGA - TS algorithm decreases the value of each objective function and increases the range of CF and NRU . The results show that the proposed algorithm enhances the global search ability , and the increase of the diversity of CF is more conducive to determining the unique solution acc ording to different risk levels .

( a ) Initial population . ( b ) Pareto optimal solution set . Fig . 5 . The objective functions’ values of the initial population and Pareto optimal solution set after normalization . The optimization process for the different number of orders is shown in Fig . 7 . The number of orders and available robotaxis in the same subregion for the four time slots are shown in Table II . Because the driving distance is related not only to the number of orders but also to the distance between the origin and destination in the order , the driving distance does not increase with the increase of the number of orders , as shown in Fig . 7 ( a ) . All robotaxis are used for delivery orders during the time slot from 8 : 00 to 8 : 20 because the scheduled starting time of passengers is relatively concentrated , as shown in Fig . 7 ( c ) . When the number of available robotaxis is 10 in other slots , at least 7 - 8 robotaxis are used , and when the number of available robotaxis is 15 , at least 9 - 12 robotaxis are used . Generally , the more orders , the more robotaxis are used . In order to prove the effectiveness of the NSGA - TS algorithm , it is compared with NSGA - Ⅱ and MOE A / D . The main indicator is the quality of solutions to compare the efficiency of algorithms . Experimental results show that NSGA - TS performs better than other algorithms under different risk levels , as shown in Table III . Nonpharmaceutical interventions such as contact patterns and social distancing can effectively prevent the spread of COVID - 19 [ 22 ] . The infection rate is 6 . 5 % when the passengers wear masks and do not maintain social distance on public transportation [ 23 ] . To verify that the proposed model can effectively reduce the virus infection rate , we assume that all passengers wear masks , and there is an abnormal order that ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) Fig . 6 .

Comparison of iterative processes for different time slots . has passengers infected with COVID - 19 in each solution . In order to further evaluate the infection rate of passengers while taking robotaxis , we reclassify the risk level into nine levels based on the proportion of infected people to the total number of people , and 6 . 5 % is used as the infection rate of contact among passengers . The relationship between driving distance and average infection rate can be obtained more intuitively by converting contact frequency to infection rate , as shown in Fig . 8 . It can be seen that the average infection rate of passengers in orders is negatively correlated with the driving distance . The infection rate of passengers is reduced during the severe pandemic , which increases the driving distance . TABLE III .

Change of infection rate with different risk levels . V . C ONCLUSION In this study , we propose the RDP and design the NSGA - TS to obtain the optimal solution . A series of experiments are performed , proving that NSGA - TS can find a well - converged and well - diversified Pareto solution set for the proposed problem . This method minimizes the number , driving distance , and waiting time of robotaxis while reducing the infection rate , which is beneficial to maximize the overall profit and minimize the cost between robotaxis and customers and also reduces the prevention cost during the pandemic time . In future work , we plan to design strategies to deal with real - time new orders . In addition , we intend to consider more realistic factors , such as traffic lights and congestion [ 24 ] - [ 28 ] .
