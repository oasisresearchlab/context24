John , chjohn @ iu . edu Abstract Background and Objectives : Two community studies outside the US showed asymptomatic infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) in adults , but not in children < 10 years of age . In this study , we assessed the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection in children and adults in Marion County , Indiana . Methods : Individuals living in Marion County with no symptoms of coronavirus 2019 disease ( COVID - 19 ) within seven days of enrollment were eligible for this cross - sectional household study . Study kits were delivered to the participant’s residence for self - swabbing , picked up by the study team , and tested by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) for SAR - CoV - 2 infection . Results : Five hundred eleven nasal swabs were collected from 119 children and 392 adults ≥18 years of age . One participant ( seven years of age ) tested positive , for an overall study prevalence of 0 . 2 % ( 95 % CI 0 , 0 . 6 % ) . The participant had no known contact with a person with SARS - CoV - 2 infection , and five family members tested negative for infection . The child and family members all tested negative for infection 10 and 20 days after the first test , and none developed symptoms of COVID - 19 for 20 days after testing . Conclusions : Asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection can occur in children < 10 years with no known COVID - 19 exposure . Large cohort studies should be conducted to determine prevalence of asymptomatic infection and risk of transmission from asymptomatic infection in children and adults over time . Categories : Pediatrics , Infectious Disease , Public Health Keywords : pediatric , child , transmission Introduction A growing body of evidence suggests that asymptomatic and pre - symptomatic cases may significantly contribute to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) [ 1 - 4 ] . It has been suggested that children are a reservoir for asymptomatic infection , but population - based studies in Iceland and Italy that assessed symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection found no infections in children < 10 years of age [ 3 , 5 ] . 1 2 3 2 2 3 2 Open Access Original Article DOI : 10 . 7759 / cureus . 9794 How to cite this article Wood J , Datta D , Hudson B L , et al .

DOI 10 . 7759 / cureus . 9794 An understanding of the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection in US communities is critical to designing effective infection prevention strategies . Data on asymptomatic infection in US children and adults in the community are not currently available . For this reason , we conducted a community - based study of the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection in adults and children in Marion County , Indiana . Materials And Methods Study design , population , and setting We conducted a cross - sectional household study of prevalence of asymptomatic SARS - CoV2 infection , titled Tracing Asymptomatic COVID - 19 Through Indianapolis Communities ( TACTIC ) in Marion County , Indiana . Marion County , which encompasses the city of Indianapolis , is the largest county in Indiana with a population of 954 , 670 in 2018 , with 235 , 211 children < 18 years of age . Individuals were eligible if they resided in a zip code within Marion County and did not show any of the following symptoms within seven days of enrollment : temperature > 100 . 5 o F ( taken orally , axillary or rectally ) , new onset cough , new onset diarrhea , new onset shortness of breath , or new onset sore throat . Individuals were excluded if they had previously tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , or were unable to provide informed consent . Participants were enrolled and tested between April 27 , 2020 and May 15 , 2020 . This study was reviewed and approved by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) . Subject screening and enrollment The study recruitment and enrollment strategy is outlined in Figure 1 . Participants were recruited using a state - wide research registry , All IN for Health , which has 4 , 093 households in Marion County . A description of the study and directions on how to participate and enroll in the All IN for Health registry if interested were circulated through social media and local news outlets , including television and websites . Households with primarily underrepresented minorities ( URM ) were first invited to participate , and one week later , a subset of households was chosen according to the household having children , having newly registered URM , or according to the need for proportionate representation from 10 zip code clusters that comprised all of Marion County . Interested participants were sent an invitation to the screening survey using the secure , web - based software platform Research Electronic Data Capture ( REDCap ) hosted at Indiana University [ 6 ] . Eligible household members were then given a consent or assent ( child aged 12 - 17 ) document to complete . 2020 Wood et al . Cureus 12 ( 8 ) : e9794 . DOI 10 . 7759 / cureus . 9794 2 of 8 FIGURE 1 : Flow chart of recruitment and enrollment strategy for the Tracing Asymptomatic COVID - 19 Through Indianapolis Communities ( TACTIC ) study . Sample collection and testing After obtaining informed consent , participants were directed to the study website with instructions and a video of nasal swab collection procedures [ 7 ] . Study participants were confirmed to be asymptomatic via REDCap prior to delivery of study kits with swabs and viral transport medium vials . After nasal swabbing by participants , sealed kits were picked up and swabs stored in a research laboratory at 4 o C until transport within 24 hours to the Purdue Animal Disease Diagnostic Lab , a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) - certified lab , for PCR testing . Viral RNA was isolated using the MagMax Viral / Pathogen Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) with a KingFisher™ Flex Magnetic Particle Processor with 96 Deep - Well Head ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , and testing for SARS - CoV2 was done by real - time polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) using the TaqPath™ RT - PCR COVID - 19 Kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) with an Applied Biosystems™ 7500 Fast Real - Time PCR Instrument used with SDS Software v1 . 5 . 1 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and the data analyzed and interpreted using the Applied Biosystems™ COVID - 19 Interpretive Software ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . This multiplex assay detects the ORF1ab , N gene , and S gene of the SARS - COV - 2 virus . The kit also contains an exogenous extraction control ( MS2 Phage Control ) 2020 Wood et al . Cureus 12 ( 8 ) : e9794 . DOI 10 . 7759 / cureus . 9794 3 of 8 to confirm nucleic extraction and monitor for PCR inhibition . Statistical analysis Based on previous studies finding a low overall community prevalence [ 3 , 5 ] , the study sample size had the power to detect a 1 % prevalence ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0 . 1 , 1 . 9 % ) with 95 % confidence interval for proportion based on normal approximation of asymptomatic infection . All other study data were descriptive . Results Characteristics of the study population Nasal swabs were collected on 511 participants , including 119 children < 18 years of age , and 392 individuals ≥18 years of age . Distribution of county and study population by age group is shown in Table 1 . Racial and ethnic characteristics of the study and county populations , by zip code cluster and overall , are shown in Figure 2 .

Using American Community Survey data , zip codes with similar demographics were grouped into ten clusters . This figure shows a cluster’s racial and ethnic breakdown , in terms of overall population percentage ( the black horizontal bar ) and the study participant percentage ( the blue vertical bars ) . Data and demographic analysis provided by The Polis Center at IUPUI . SARS - CoV - 2 PCR testing results Among the 511 participants tested , one participant , a seven - year - old boy , tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 ( prevalence 0 . 2 % [ 95 % CI 0 , 0 . 6 % ] ) . The prevalence among children ( n = 119 ) was 0 . 8 % ( 95 % CI 0 , 2 . 5 % ) . The one child who tested positive was biracial ( African - American / Caucasian ) and lived in a household with his mother and five siblings . One child declined study participation . The other four children and the mother were all negative for SARS - CoV2 infection . Neither the infected child nor anyone else in the household reported 2020 Wood et al . Cureus 12 ( 8 ) : e9794 . DOI 10 . 7759 / cureus . 9794 5 of 8 having contact with a person known to have COVID - 19 . The cycle threshold ( Ct ) values for the three target gene PCR reactions were 23 - 25 , low levels indicating a significant viral load . Ten days after testing , the child , siblings , and mother all tested negative on repeat PCR testing 10 and 20 days after initial testing and all remained asymptomatic during this period . Among the 392 asymptomatic adults ≥18 years of age , none tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( prevalence 0 % ) . Discussion Multiple studies from China have reported asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection in children , but these studies involved children in contact with infected individuals and were not community surveys of asymptomatic infection [ 1 , 2 ] . Community surveys in Iceland and Italy that included symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals found a low prevalence of infection ( 0 . 8 % to 2 . 6 % ) , and both studies found no infection in children < 10 years of age [ 3 , 4 ] . In the state of Indiana , a community prevalence study of individuals > 12 years of age found an active infection rate ( by PCR ) of 1 . 7 % and an overall prevalence of current ( PCR ) or previous infection ( SARS - CoV - 2 antibody ) of 2 . 8 % [ 8 ] . Prevalence of asymptomatic infection in this study was 0 . 76 % , within the range of our finding of 0 . 2 % prevalence in the population [ 8 ] . Despite the concern about spread of SARS - CoV - 2 infection from asymptomatic individuals in the community , there have been no published studies of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in asymptomatic adults and children 12 years and under in the United States to date . In the present study , we found no asymptomatic infection in 392 adults ≥18 years of age , but found that one of 119 asymptomatic children ≤18 years was infected ( prevalence 0 . 8 % , 95 % CI 0 , 2 . 5 % ) . The sole infected individual was seven years of age , demonstrating , contrary to prior studies , that children under 11 years of age in the community may carry asymptomatic infection . The source of the child’s infection was unclear , as no other household members tested positive . It is possible other family members in the home were previously infected and no longer shedding . Future serologic studies would be helpful and are planned . The positive result was reported to the Indiana State Department of Health for further evaluation and contact tracing . The positive test rate in the state of Indiana during the study period was 11 . 3 % , with an average of 591 positive individuals per day [ 9 ] . Our study ' s finding of a very low prevalence of asymptomatic infection provides reassurance on the benefits of the state implementation of social distancing measures , which went in to effect March 24th with a stay at home order and a phased reopening starting May 11th in Marion county . Even with this low prevalence , infection in one child out of 119 tested ( 0 . 84 % ) yields an estimate of 1977 children asymptomatically infected in Indianapolis / Marion County ( 95 % CI 0 , 6209 ) . The large confidence intervals demonstrate the preliminary nature of this data . Larger studies of asymptomatic infection that include young children are needed to determine the relative prevalence of asymptomatic infection in children and adults with greater precision . Additionally , longitudinal studies across multiple geographic areas are needed to determine how prevalence varies in different areas , especially as social distancing measures are relaxed . Testing of antibodies to SARS - CoV - 2 in these individuals could help to determine the rate of past infection , another important measure for which there is little data in children . Antibody testing is planned in this cohort . The increasing reports of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children ( MIS - C ) temporally associated with prior SARS - CoV - 2 infection , most of which appears to have been asymptomatic [ 10 - 12 ] , underscore the importance and urgency of increasing our understanding of asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection and its potential sequelae in children . Strengths of this study include the specific investigation of asymptomatic individuals ; use of community engagement to recruit a representative cohort of individuals ; the innovative sample distribution and collection methods , which made the study possible in a period of 2020 Wood et al . Cureus 12 ( 8 ) : e9794 . DOI 10 . 7759 / cureus . 9794 6 of 8 active SARS - CoV - 2 transmission ; use of self / parent - administered nasal swabs , recently shown to be similar in sensitivity for SARS - CoV - 2 detection to nasopharyngeal swabs [ 13 , 14 ] , which made home testing of children feasible ; and the intentional inclusion of both children and adults in testing . The primary limitations were the relatively small sample size for a population study and the non - random selection of study participants . Despite the small sample size , we were able to detect low frequency infection , but the 95 % confidence intervals of the estimates included zero , so the study data are best viewed as important initial data on which to base future studies of asymptomatic infection in children and adults . We chose a non - random recruitment process because we had a research registry that mirrored overall population demographics and therefore was likely to provide a sample representative of the geographic and racial diversity of the county / city population . Additionally , study enrollment required access to internet / email which may have biased our population to a higher socioeconomic class . Random selection might have derived a population more fully representative of the county population , but participation rates would likely have been far lower , and the final sample may not have been substantially different from the sample we obtained . Conclusions In the present study , we found asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection in one seven - year - old child with no history of known SARS - CoV - 2 exposure , out of 119 children tested ( prevalence 0 . 84 % , 95 % CI , 0 , 2 . 5 % ) and in none of the 392 adults ≥18 years of age tested . The study demonstrates that children < 10 years of age with no known SARS - CoV - 2 exposure may harbor asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection . In this instance the child did not transmit infection to close contacts . The study sets the stage for future larger studies of asymptomatic infection in children to determine risk and patterns of transmission in the community and devise strategies for infection prevention .
