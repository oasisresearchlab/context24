Based on one study , the association with cancer - specific mortal - ity was stronger for SCC ( MR 2 . 17 ) than BCC ( MR 1 . 15 ) . Across multiple types of cancer both SCC and BCC tended to be associated with poorer survival from second primary malignancies . Multiple studies support an association between NMSC and fatal outcomes ; the associations tend to be more potent for SCC than BCC . Additional investiga - tion is needed to more precisely characterize these associa - tions and elucidate potential underlying mechanisms . Keywords Nonmelanoma skin cancer · Keratinocyte carcinoma · Mortality · Survival · Fatality · Epidemiology · Systematic review · Neoplasms Introduction Nonmelanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) is diagnosed more commonly than all other malignancies combined , and it is a growing public health problem due to its increasing inci - dence [ 1 ] and attendant medical care costs [ 2 ] . NMSC con - sists of two major histologic subtypes , basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) and squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) . NMSC is generally easily curable with surgical excision and is rarely fatal . Despite such a favorable prognosis , there is evidence that NMSC may be a marker of other adverse health out - comes . An association between NMSC and increased risk of other malignancies has been well documented [ 3 – 5 ] . A smaller but growing body of evidence raises the possibil - ity that NMSC may also be associated with increased mor - tality [ 6 – 16 ] . The variable methods and findings of exist - ing studies make it difficult to discern the consistency and strength of the association between NMSC and mortality , necessary first steps for assessing whether the association Abstract Some reports suggest that a history of non - melanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) may be associated with increased mortality . NMSCs have very low fatality rates , but the high prevalence of NMSC elevates the importance of the possibility of associated subsequent mortality from other causes . The variable methods and findings of exist - ing studies leave the significance of these results uncer - tain . To provide clarity , we conducted a systematic review to characterize the evidence on the associations of NMSC with : ( 1 ) all - cause mortality , ( 2 ) cancer - specific mortal - ity , and ( 3 ) cancer survival . Bibliographic databases were searched through February 2016 . Cohort studies published in English were included if adequate data were provided to estimate mortality ratios in patients with - versus - without NMSC . Data were abstracted from the total of eight stud - ies from independent data sources that met inclusion cri - teria ( n = 3 for all - cause mortality , n = 2 for cancer - specific mortality , and n = 5 for cancer survival ) . For all - cause mortality , a significant increased risk was observed for patients with a history of squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) ( mortality ratio estimates ( MR ) 1 . 25 and 1 . 30 ) , whereas no increased risk was observed for patients with a history of * Anthony J .

For example , this link could be related to confounding factors , such as socioeco - nomic status or smoking . Furthermore , because NMSC is associated with increased risk of other types of cancer , an increase in all - cause mortality could be the result of an increase in cancer - specific mortality . To clarify the relationship between NMSC and mortal - ity , we summarized the existing evidence by performing a systematic review to address the following three questions : ( 1 ) is NMSC associated with all - cause mortality ? ( 2 ) is NMSC associated with cancer - specific mortality ? and ( 3 ) is NMSC associated with poorer survival among patients diagnosed with another type of cancer ? Characterizing the published evidence for each of these interrelated questions will help to unify a currently disparate body of evidence and help to bring clarity to questions that currently elude clear interpretation . Methods In February 2016 , a literature review within the PubMed and SCOPUS databases was conducted . The search strat - egy was a title search that used the following specific search terms and Boolean logic : ( ( cutaneous basal cell OR cutaneous squamous cell OR keratinocyte OR non - melanoma OR skin ) AND ( cancer OR carcinoma ) ) AND ( death OR mortality OR prognosis OR survival ) . Other databases searched , including the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature ( CINAHL ) Plus and Health Source , did not retrieve any additional relevant stud - ies . The electronic searches were supplemented with hand - searches of references in related articles identified in Pub - Med citations . Studies eligible for inclusion in this systematic review met the following criteria : ( a ) were cohort studies involving patients with a NMSC diagnosis ; ( b ) provided an estimate of a mortality ratio or relative risk of death for the associa - tion of NMSC and mortality ; and ( c ) were reported in Eng - lish . Exclusion criteria included : ( a ) only reported associa - tions with cause - specific fatal outcomes other than cancer such as suicide [ 17 ] ; ( b ) evaluation of NMSC - specific mor - tality ; and ( c ) assessment of rare skin cancers other than BCC or SCC , such as Merkel cell carcinoma and adnexal cell carcinoma , or precursor skin conditions , such as actinic keratosis [ 18 ] . The initial electronic bibliographic database search yielded 191 studies , of which six studies met the inclu - sion criteria . Additional six studies that met the inclusion criteria were ascertained via hand - searches of related articles , for a total of 12 articles eligible for inclusion in the systematic review . However , the evidence was com - plicated by the fact that of the seven published reports that included evidence for the association between NMSC and all - cause mortality , five were from Denmark and had a considerable degree of overlapping data [ 8 – 11 , 19 ] . In these Danish studies by Jensen and colleagues and by Brøndum - Jacobsen et al . , the NMSC patient populations were derived from either the Gerda Frentz Cohort ( GFC ) , a Danish cohort of prospectively recorded patients with NMSC seen by dermatologists in 1995 , or the Danish Cancer Registry ( DCR ) between the years of 1978 to 2006 , as shown in Table 1 . The 2007 report used almost the same patient data as the previous 2006 report , with the addition of two more years of data from the GFC and DCR , as its purpose was to compare data between the two registries . The DCR and GFC cohorts overlap as patients with NMSC in the GFC cohort are a subset of the DCR population [ 11 ] . The 2008 report sought to examine total and cause - specific mortality among patients with NMSC by comparing mortality rates to those computed from the general population and used a larger set of patient data from years 1978 to 2001 . This time period includes much of the DCR data used in the other three reports of Jensen et al . Not surprisingly , given the large degree of overlap ( i . e . , lack of statistical independence ) in the study popu - lations from all four of these publications from Denmark by Jensen and colleagues , each of the four reports yielded similar results . Therefore , to avoid redundancy the 2008 report data are used as the sole data source presented in the evidence tables , but for completeness , the results from the other Danish reports are noted in the text . After this step , the number of studies summarized in the evidence tables was 3 for all - cause mortality , 2 for cancer - specific mortality , and five studies of survival after diagnosis with a type of cancer other than NMSC . Data extracted from the reports were measurements of relative mortality risks , including mortality rate ratios ( MRR ) , standardized mortality ratios ( SMR ) , hazard ratios ( HR ) , and relative risks of death ( RR ) . Henceforth , for our purposes , the term “mortality ratio” ( MR ) is used to generi - cally refer to this spectrum of measures of association that are calculated in different ways . When multiple mortality ratio estimates were provided with different adjustments , the estimates with the greatest number of adjustments were used . When sub - analyses with multiple stratifications were provided , the least - stratified results were used . If data for both NMSC and individual histologic subtypes were pro - vided , all of the estimates were included in the results for comparative purposes . SCC and BCC commonly occur in the same patients . In studies that explicitly stated how these patients were han - dled , they were either assigned to both BCC and to SCC separately [ 11 , 14 ] , assigned to the SCC group [ 9 ] , or assigned to both groups , as well as analyzed separately as a group of patients with “mixed NMSC” [ 8 ] . 245 Arch Dermatol Res ( 2017 ) 309 : 243 – 251 1 3 Table 1 Summary of studies with relevant data on the association between nonmelanoma skin cancer and ( 1 ) all - cause mortality ; ( 2 ) cancer - specific mortality , and ( 3 ) survival after the diagnosis with another form of cancer First Author Location Study type Study period Case Ascer - tainment NMSC type # NMSC cases Outcome ( s ) Adjustments Askling [ 6 ] Sweden Retrospec - tive cohort ( Swedish Cancer Reg - istry ) 1958 – 1996 ICD codes from registry SCC 1 , 660 Cancer sur - vival A , G , C Brøndum - Jacobsen [ 19 ] Denmark a Case – control ( Danish Can - cer Registry ) 1980 – 2006 ICD codes from registry NMSC 129 , 206 All - cause mortality Matched w / 5 controls on A , G , C , plus adj . for SES , exercise Hjalgrim [ 7 ] Denmark Registry - based ( Danish Can - cer Registry ) 1978 – 1994 ICD codes from registry NMSC ( BCC , SCC ) 605 Cancer sur - vival A , G , C Jensen [ 10 ] Denmark a Registry - based ( Gerda Frentz Cohort ) 1995 – 2004 ICD codes from registry BCC , SCC 3 , 209 All - cause mortality ; Cancer - specific mortality CO , civil status Jensen [ 11 ] Denmark a Registry - based ( Gerda Frentz Cohort & Danish C .

Calculations were performed algebraically on the log scale , resulting in combined aver - ages and errors weighted by sample size [ 20 ] . Standard errors of the sex - specific mortality ratios were calculated by dividing the width of the reported 95 % confidence inter - val by 2 × 1 . 96 . The final combined estimates were expo - nentiated back to the original scale . Results NMSC and all - cause mortality Three published reports that included evidence for the asso - ciation between NMSC and all - cause mortality are sum - marized in Table 2 , two prospective cohort studies [ 13 , 15 ] and a retrospective cohort study [ 8 ] . Kahn et al . used data from the American Cancer Society’s ( ACS ) Cancer Preven - tion Study II ( CPS - II ) that enrolled 1 , 184 , 659 ACS volun - teers ≥ 30 years of age in 1982 throughout the United States and Puerto Rico , assessed history of NMSC through self - report , and ascertained outcomes through 1994 via active follow - up and linkage to the National Death Index [ 13 ] . NMSC was observed to be associated with a slight increase in relation to all - cause mortality ( mortality ratio ( MR ) 1 . 04 ; 95 % CI 1 . 01 – 1 . 06 ) . The results of the additional report from Denmark by Brondum - Jacobsen et al . [ 19 ] were slightly in the inverse direction ( mortality ratio 0 . 97 ; 95 % CI 0 . 96 – 0 . 99 ) . Two studies presented results stratified by histologic type . The cohort study of Rees et al . followed 2713 par - ticipants from a population - based case – control study , the New Hampshire Skin Cancer Study . Outcomes were ascer - tained by linking deaths to the New Hampshire State Can - cer Registry and National Death Index from 1993 to 2002 [ 15 ] . Patients with a history of BCC had a hazard ratio of 0 . 96 ( 95 % CI 0 . 77 – 1 . 19 ) in the study of Rees et al . [ 15 ] and standardized mortality ratio of 0 . 97 ( 95 % CI 0 . 96 – 0 . 98 ) in the study of Jensen et al . [ 8 ] . The results of the additional reports from Denmark by Jensen and colleagues [ 9 – 11 ] were slightly stronger inverse associations ranging from 0 . 89 ( 95 % CI 0 . 83 – 0 . 95 ) [ 10 ] to 0 . 96 ( 95 % CI 0 . 91 – 1 . 00 ) [ 11 ] . Whereas the evidence for BCC pointed toward an inverse association with all - cause mortality , the evidence for SCC was in the opposite direction . Specifically , the associations for SCC were a hazards ratio of 1 . 25 ( 95 % CI 1 . 01 – 1 . 54 ) [ 14 ] and SMR of 1 . 30 ( 95 % CI 1 . 26 – 1 . 33 ) [ 8 ] . The results of the additional reports from Denmark by Jensen and colleagues [ 9 – 11 ] were consistently in the direction of increased risk and of comparable [ 11 ] or greater [ 10 ] magnitude . In the age - stratified data presented in the 2010 report [ 9 ] , there was evidence of a strong inter - action with a stronger association in those < 70 years of age ( MRR 1 . 54 ; 95 % CI 1 . 41 – 1 . 68 ) compared to older A age , G gender , C calendar period , CO comorbidity , MS marital status , R race , RL residence location , S smoking , SES socioeconomic status , MULT family cancer hx , BMI , alcohol use , exercise , diet , aspirin use , women hormone use , reproductive hx . a Not included in evidence tables due to overlap with Jensen et al . 2008 . b Only study that explicitly stated deaths attributed to NMSC were excluded from the calculation of the mortality ratios .

The sole study to explicitly evaluate “mixed NMSC” patients described a “similar excess mortality” as was observed among patients with SCC alone [ 8 ] . NMSC and cancer - specific mortality Two studies provided data to assess the association between NMSC and cancer - specific mortality ( Table 3 ) . In the ACS CPS - II Cohort , NMSC was associated with a significantly elevated cancer death rate ( MR 1 . 28 ; 95 % CI 1 . 22 – 1 . 34 ) [ 13 ] . In the study of Jensen et al . carried out in Denmark [ 8 ] , significantly increased mortality from malignancy was observed for a personal history of BCC ( MR 1 . 15 ; 95 % CI 1 . 13 – 1 . 18 ) and an even stronger association for SCC ( MR 2 . 17 ; 95 % CI 2 . 08 – 2 . 26 ) ( Table 3 ) [ 8 ] . The results of an additional report from Denmark by Jensen et al . [ 10 ] revealed a similar pattern of associations but attenuated , with MRs of 1 . 01 for BCC and 1 . 63 for SCC . NMSC and survival in cancer patients Five studies provide evidence for the association between a history of NMSC and survival in cancer patients . They include patient populations from Denmark , Sweden , Canada , and the United States ( Table 1 ) [ 6 , 7 , 12 , 14 , 16 ] and assess a variety of cancer sites , including multiple can - cer sites grouped , Non - Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) and the phenotypic variant chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , colon cancer , lung cancer , breast cancer , and prostate cancer . In a cohort comprised of patients with heterogeneous types of cancer , both BCC ( MR 1 . 14 ; 95 % CI 1 . 10 – 1 . 18 ) and SCC ( MR 1 . 33 ; 95 % CI 1 . 15 – 1 . 55 ) were associated with significantly increased mortality [ 14 ] ( Table 4 ) . The significantly worse survival in patients with - versus - without a prior history of SCC was also corroborated by Johannes - dottir et al . [ 12 ] . Some studies reported on survival after diagnosis with specific types of cancer . In a study of CLL , mortality was significantly increased among those with NMSC compared with those with no personal history of NMSC ( MR 1 . 29 ; 95 % CI 1 . 10 – 1 . 52 ) [ 16 ] ; the association for SCC was even stronger ( MR 1 . 86 ; 95 % CI 1 . 46 – 2 . 36 ) [ 16 ] . However , this study was unable to distinguish to what extent deaths from SCC contributed to this association as patients with CLL have an elevated risk of death from SCC [ 21 ] . In all other reports that studied the association of mortality in NHL patients with and without NMSC , the mortality ratios were Table 3 Summary of mortality ratios ( and 95 % confidence inter - vals ) from prospective studies reporting on the association between nonmelanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) , basal cell carcinoma of the skin ( BCC ) , and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin ( SCC ) in relation to cancer - specific mortality MR mortality ratio , RR relative risk , SMR standardized mortality ratio NP Not presented a The study of Kahn et al . explicitly excluded NMSC deaths from the calculation of the mortality ratio , the study of Jensen et al . did not First author Measure of association NMSC BCC SCC Kahn a [ 13 ] RR 1 . 28 ( 1 . 22 – 1 . 34 ) NP NP Jensen a [ 8 ] SMR NP 1 . 15 ( 1 . 13 – 1 . 18 ) 2 . 17 ( 2 . 08 – 2 . 26 ) Table 4 Summary of mortality ratios ( and 95 % confidence limits ) from prospective studies reporting on the association between nonmelanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) , basal cell carcinoma of the skin ( BCC ) , and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin ( SCC ) in relation to cancer survival NA Not Applicable ; * studied only the chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) subtype of NHL ; ¤ in patients > 70 years of age MR mortality ratio First author All NHL / CLL Colon Lung Breast Prostate NMSC Toro [ 16 ] NA 1 . 29 ( 1 . 10 – 1 . 52 ) * NA NA NA NA Hjalgrim [ 7 ] NA 1 . 32 ( 1 . 07 – 1 . 63 ) 0 . 99 ( 0 . 86 – 1 . 14 ) NA NA NA BCC Nugent [ 14 ] 1 . 14 ( 1 . 10 – 1 . 18 ) 1 . 06 ( 0 . 88 – 1 . 27 ) 1 . 24 ( 1 . 10 – 1 . 40 ) 1 . 11 ( 1 . 01 – 1 . 22 ) 1 . 02 ( 0 . 88 – 1 . 18 ) 0 . 85 ( 0 . 77 – 0 . 94 ) Hjalgrim [ 7 ] NA 1 . 51 ( 1 . 15 – 1 . 99 ) * 0 . 95 ( 0 . 79 – 1 . 14 ) NA NA NA SCC Johannesdottir [ 12 ] 1 . 13 ( 1 . 04 – 1 . 23 ) 1 . 09 ( 0 . 81 – 1 . 47 ) 1 . 13 ( 0 . 92 – 1 . 40 ) 1 . 23 ( 1 . 05 – 1 . 43 ) 1 . 09 ( 0 . 82 – 1 . 43 ) 0 . 97 ( 0 . 81 – 1 . 15 ) Toro [ 16 ] NA 1 . 86 ( 1 . 46 – 2 . 36 ) NA NA NA NA Nugent [ 14 ] 1 . 33 ( 1 . 15 – 1 . 55 ) 1 . 21 ( 0 . 88 – 1 . 67 ) 1 . 29 ( 1 . 01 – 1 . 65 ) 1 . 25 ( 1 . 05 – 1 . 48 ) 1 . 12 ( 0 . 31 – 2 . 88 ) 1 . 07 ( 0 . 91 – 1 . 27 ) Hjalgrim [ 7 ] NA 1 . 75 ( 0 . 98 – 3 . 13 ) * 1 . 60 ( 1 . 06 – 2 . 40 ) NA NA NA Askling [ 6 ] NA 1 . 39 ( 1 . 17 – 1 . 64 ) 1 . 26 ( 1 . 09 – 1 . 47 ) 1 . 23 ( 0 . 95 – 1 . 60 ) 1 . 37 ( 0 . 97 – 2 . 36 ) ¤ 1 . 17 ( 1 . 04 – 1 . 33 ) 248 Arch Dermatol Res ( 2017 ) 309 : 243 – 251 1 3 in the direction of increased risk even if not statistically significant . In the two studies that presented results strati - fied by histologic type , the mortality ratios were slightly stronger for SCC than for BCC in both : 1 . 75 vs 1 . 51 [ 7 ] and 1 . 21 vs 1 . 06 [ 14 ] . Among patients with colon cancer , BCC was associ - ated with a statistically significant increase in mortality ( MR 1 . 24 ; 95 % CI 1 . 10 – 1 . 40 ) in one report [ 14 ] , but no association was observed in another report [ 7 ] . For SCC , however , the four MR estimates were consistently in the risk direction with three of these statistically significant . In patients with lung cancer , the evidence pointed in the direction of increased risk in all three studies . In the study of Nugent et al . [ 14 ] , increased mortality was observed for lung cancer patients with a history of BCC ( MR 1 . 11 ; 95 % CI 1 . 01 – 1 . 22 ) and with a history of SCC ( MR 1 . 25 ; 95 % CI 1 . 05 – 1 . 48 ) ; the mortality ratio estimates for SCC from two other studies mimicked the results of Nugent et al . [ 6 , 12 ] . Of the three reports assessing mortality in breast cancer patients according to NMSC history , the MRs for SCC were 1 . 09 ( 95 % CI 0 . 82 – 1 . 43 ) , 1 . 12 ( 95 % CI 0 . 31 – 2 . 88 ) , and 1 . 37 ( 95 % CI 0 . 97 – 2 . 36 ) , and for BCC was 1 . 02 ( 0 . 88 – 1 . 88 ) . Three reports also assessed mortality in NMSC patients with prostate cancer . One of these observed a significant decrease in mortality for prostate cancer patients with a history of BCC ( MR 0 . 85 ) , whereas one observed a significant increase in mortality in patients with a history of SCC ( MR 1 . 17 ) ; the two remaining reports were specific to SCC and the mortality ratio estimates were close to the null and not statistically significant . Discussion In this systematic review , the existing evidence was sum - marized related to the associations between a personal history of NMSC , and ( 1 ) all - cause mortality , ( 2 ) cancer - specific mortality , and ( 3 ) survival in cancer patients . The systematic review identified 12 published reports from eight independent data sources that met the eligibility criteria . These reports included data from four different countries published from 1998 to 2015 . Two overarching themes emerged from the results . First , there was at least some signal that NMSC was associated with increased risk for each of the fatal outcomes studied . Second , the results for each outcome revealed heterogeneity by histologic type , with associations consistently stronger for SCC than BCC . For all - cause mortality , the risk association was actually completely confined to those with SCC . Studies of rela - tive survival in NMSC patients only were not eligible for inclusion , but a study of relative survival in SCC and BCC patients in Germany observed that relative survival in SCC patients was 93 . 6 % compared with 102 . 9 % in BCC patients [ 22 ] . Although relative survival estimates do not map back directly to mortality ratios , these estimates corroborate our findings for all - cause mortality in indicating that compared with the general population without NMSC , SCC is associ - ated with excess mortality , whereas BCC is associated with reduced mortality . Hollestein et al . [ 23 ] observed a similar relative survival rate for SCC and commented “…due to a higher prevalence of mortality risk factors ( e . g . , solid organ transplantation , use of immunosuppressive drugs ) among SCC patients compared to the general population , we might have over - estimated SCC - specific mortality , resulting in lower relative survival estimates . ” In the one study of can - cer - specific mortality , the association was much stronger for SCC compared with BCC ( MR 2 . 17 vs . 1 . 15 ) [ 8 ] . Given the importance of this heterogeneity by histologic type , the ensuing discussion focuses on the stratified results . A key question is if the association between SCC and all - cause mortality is driven by an increase in cancer - specific mortality , and , therefore , perhaps , due to the fact that SCC is a marker of increased risk for other malignancies . The reasons outlined below make it safe to infer that this is not the case . First , both SCC and BCC are markers of increased risk for other malignancies , but only SCC was associated with increased all - cause mortality , suggesting that the all - cause mortality increase associated with SCC is not due solely to increasing risk of other cancers . Second , Rees et al . specifically addressed this question and the findings indicated that the overall mortality increase in SCC patients could not be attributed solely to the increased occurrence of cancer in SCC patients [ 15 ] . Third , if the excess all - cause mortality in SCC patients was driven exclusively by can - cer mortality , then no increased mortality from causes of death other than cancer would be expected . In at least one report that examined cause - specific mortality from several causes , BCC showed an elevation in risk of other cancers but was significantly inversely associated with chronic and infectious causes of mortality , whereas SCC was associated with significant increases in mortality not only from cancer , but also from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , car - diovascular diseases , acute infections , and pneumonia [ 8 ] . These results not only reinforce the substantive difference in the associations of all - cause mortality with SCC but not BCC , but the heterogeneous causes of death observed to be associated with SCC is thought - provoking and consistent with an association with underlying immune dysfunctions . The risk of cardiovascular disease is known to be increased in individuals with underlying inflammatory diseases including psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis [ 24 ] . The increase in mortality among SCC patients from acute infection and pneumonia [ 8 ] raises the possibility of an underlying immunosuppression among individuals with SCC which predisposes to infection . Patients with under - lying immunosuppression , including due to solid organ 249 Arch Dermatol Res ( 2017 ) 309 : 243 – 251 1 3 transplantation and underlying chronic lymphocytic leu - kemia , are at increased risk of developing cutaneous SCC [ 25 ] . Further evidence that immune dysregulation may be a contributing factor to the stronger associations with mor - tality observed for SCC than BCC stems from the obser - vation that even though BCC is more common than SCC by approximately a 4 : 1 ratio in the general population , the incidence of BCC and SCC is reversed in transplant patients who are immunosuppressed ; in immunosuppressed patients , SCC occurs ten times more frequently than BCC [ 26 ] . The notion that SCC is more strongly linked than BCC to immune dysregulation provides a viable explana - tion for why SCC , but not BCC would be associated with all - cause mortality and how SCC could be associated with an increase in all - cause mortality via pathways other than increased cancer incidence . This line of reasoning is further buttressed by differ - ences in the role of exposure to solar ultraviolet radia - tion ( UVR ) in the etiology of SCC and BCC . UVR is the strongest environmental risk factor for both BCC and SCC , but BCC is most strongly associated with intermittent UVR exposure , whereas SCC is most strongly linked with cumu - lative lifetime UVR exposure [ 25 ] . UVR exposure is known to result in immune suppression [ 27 ] . Furthermore , humans have no response , such as photoadaptation or photoprotec - tion , which diminishes UVR - induced immune suppression over time ; thus , long - term chronic UVR exposure results in long - term chronic immune suppression [ 28 ] . SCC is , there - fore , more likely than BCC to be a marker of greater cumu - lative immune suppression over a lifetime . In turn , immune dysregulation is hypothesized to play a central role in the pathogenesis of chronic diseases that are leading causes of death in middle and upper income nations , such as cardio - vascular disease and cancer [ 29 , 30 ] . The socioeconomic status ( SES ) differential between SCC and BCC may also come into play as either a con - founder or a mediator . The risk of both SCC and BCC increases with higher levels of SES , but the associa - tion is much stronger for BCC than for SCC [ 31 ] . SES is inversely associated with overall mortality [ 32 ] . If on aver - age patients diagnosed with BCC are of higher SES than those with SCC , then the stronger associations with mor - tality for SCC compared with BCC could be due partly to the SES differential between the two , with SES acting as a confounder . Conversely , SES could play a mediating role . Across a broad spectrum of specific microorganisms , the prevalence of infection increases with lower SES [ 33 ] . The complex interplay between SES , infectious diseases , and SCC / BCC aligns with the hypothesis described above that immune status may be a factor contributing to why SCCs but not BCCs are associated with excess mortality rates . Compared with persons of higher SES , persons from lower SES levels have increased risk of both SCCs and infections . The heterogeneity in the findings by histologic type also impacts the research approaches to this topic . When considering fatal outcomes , stratifying by histologic type is essential , because any grouped category of NMSC will mix the divergent influence of SCC and BCC . This is illus - trated by the MRs for “NMSC” being intermediate between those of BCC and SCC , more closely approximating the lesser MRs of BCC , because the incidence rates of BCC greatly exceed those of SCC [ 25 ] . The SCC / BCC hetero - geneity also elevates the importance of paying direct atten - tion to patients who have been diagnosed with both SCC and BCC . This group comprises only a small proportion of all NMSC patients , but evaluating the associations for this group separately—rather than embedding them within both SCC and BCC patients—holds promise for generating new insights into the differential associations in SCC vs BCC . Limitations of this study include the relatively small number of studies that have been conducted for each spe - cific type of fatal outcome considered in this review , with further uncertainty introduced by the fact that the relevant data were generated using heterogeneous approaches to study design and control of potential confounding vari - ables . Most of the studies were limited to pathology - con - firmed NMSC cases , but one study relied on self - reported NMSC [ 13 ] . The lack of rigorous control for potential confound - ing factors is a limitation for the existing body of evidence on the topic of NMSC in relation to the fatal outcomes reviewed , leaving open the possibility that the observed associations could be due to confounding factors and therefore indirect . That is , if factors associated with mul - tiple causes of death were also more prevalent in NMSC patients , then this would contribute to NMSC appearing to be associated with greater mortality rates . A potential example of such a factor is cigarette smok - ing . Cigarette smoking is causally associated with many major causes of death [ 34 , 35 ] and has been observed in at least some studies to be more common in NMSC patients , especially those with SCC [ 36 , 37 ] . Furthermore , smoking is more prevalent among individuals of lower SES [ 38 ] . The results for cigarette smoking also tie into the hypoth - esis that immune dysregulation is an important underlying contributor to the stronger role of SCC - versus - BCC in rela - tion to fatal outcomes , as cigarette smoking is a cause of inflammation and immune dysregulation [ 38 ] . Only two of the published studies acquired individual - level data in which more confounding factors could be adjusted for , including cigarette smoking [ 13 , 15 ] plus a variety of health , behavior , and environmental exposures [ 13 ] versus the other registry - based studies in which often only age , gender , and calendar period could be adjusted for . The fact that the associations still persisted in these stud - ies that adjusted for potential confounding variables [ 13 , 250 Arch Dermatol Res ( 2017 ) 309 : 243 – 251 1 3 15 ] provides preliminary evidence to suggest that the asso - ciation between SCC and fatal outcomes may not be due to confounding , but this issue awaits more thorough assess - ment in future studies . The current body of evidence indicating that SCC may be associated with increased mortality rates is intriguing , and the public health importance of these associations is underscored by the high prevalence of SCC . Further research is needed to establish the validity of these asso - ciations , particularly studies with the capability of adjust - ing for individual - level factors and stratifying by histologic subtype of NMSC . Further study is also needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these associations to determine if these associations may have significance for translation into the clinical setting . For example , knowing why SCC is a marker of decreased survival in cancer patients could potentially impact cancer treatment planning . Furthermore , simple interventions such as recommending age - appropri - ate cancer screening and thorough review of systems for patients diagnosed with SCC may help to increase earlier detection of second malignancies at an earlier and more treatable stage .
