Abstract The COVID - 19 pandemic has led to considerable morbidity and mortality , and consumed enormous unnecessary resources ( e . g . energy ) on to control and prevent the disease prevention and control . It is crucial to balance infection risk and energy consumption on when reducing the spread of infection risk reduction . In this study , a quantitative human , behavior - based , infection risk - energy consumption model for different indoor environments was developed . An oOptimal balance point for each indoor environment can be obtained with using the anti - problem method . For this study we selected Wangjing Block , one of the most densely populated places in Beijing , Taking Wangjing block as an example . , Uunder the current ventilation standard ( 30 m 3 / h / person ) , the prevention and control on of the COVID - 19 pandemic would be insufficient because the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) of for students , workers and elders are more greater than 1 . The optimal required fresh air ventilation rates in most indoor environments are approaching near or below 60 m 3 / h / person , after taking considering the combined effects of multiple mitigation measures . While inIn residences , sports buildings and restaurants , their the demands for fresh air ventilation rate are is relatively largehigh . After our globally optimization on of infection risk control ( R 0 ≤1 ) , the energy consumption can be reduced by 13 . 7 % and 45 . 1 % at on weekdays and weekends , respectively , in contrast compared to the a strategy of strict control ( R 0 = 1 in for each indoor environment ) . Keywords : COVID - 19 , pandemic prevention and control , human behavior , infection risk , energy consumption 1 . Introduction The pandemic of the emerging respiratory infection , Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , has posed been a great challenge to for the healthy cities and societies [ 1 ] . The global economic loss caused by COVID - 19 reached is estimated to be between $ 5 . 8 to and $ 8 . 8 trillion [ 2 ] . More than 99 % of COVID - 19 infections occurred in indoor environments [ 3 ] , and with the airborne was route considered as ato be the main route of for SARS - CoV - 2 transmission [ 4 - 6 ] . Non - pharmaceutical interventions ( e . g . ventilation , air disinfection by filtration or UV light , mask wearing ) are necessary for COVID - 19 prevention and control when since the airborne route dominates the transmission [ 7 - 10 ] . To minimize the infection risk , many indoor environments maximized the ventilation , installed many air disinfection equipment , and made wearing masks mandatory , which inevitably resulted in serious greatly increased resource consumptions [ 11 - 13 ] . The increased energy used by building residents resulted in high energy bills and also leads to a scarcity in the energy supply [ 14 - 16 ] . Based on Aa case study of undertaken in China , it is found that during the pandemic , the energy consumption of HVAC systems increaseds by 128 % [ 17 ] . Since buildings consume over one - third of energy globally , with 40 – 50 % of it being expended on HVAC systems [ 18 ] , In addition , the task goal of making buildings energy efficientcy is of great significance for achieving the global carbon - neutral target as buildings consume over one - third of energy globally , 40 – 50 % of it expended on HVAC systems [ 19 , 20 ] . It is illustrated that Hhuman behaviors and environmental features vary greatly vary in different indoor environments , hence and so directly determine the distinction in theiraffect the particular epidemic prevention strategies used [ 21 ] . Although many organizations ( e . g . ASHRAE , WHO ) and researchers have proposed building and system - related control suggestions mechanisms to mitigate infection risk during the COVID - 19 pandemic , several shortcomings remained . First , the differences of in virus inhalation and exhalation caused by people’s physical activity in indoor environments were rarely considered in these suggestions . Second , the time - varying characteristics of viral load in COVID - 19 patients can influence the infection risk significantly , but were this was mostly ignoredcommonly neglected . Third , qualitative recommendations fail to specify how much of the degree to which disinfection measures are needed to achieve an acceptable level of risk level in a particular space [ 22 ] . Fourth , an acceptable value for the probability of infection ( PI ) used as an index for of a safe environment , are is still unclear for an acceptable value [ 7 ] . Fifth , the Wells - Riley model was modified and employed extensively to quantitatively calculate PI , while its time - independent assumption remained unnoticed . It is therefore not always in line with the actual situation , especially when the exposure period is relatively long [ 23 ] . Finally , current studies took considered a single indoor environment other rather than multiple - indoor environments into consideration to maximize their efficiency , and it would bring this introduced large errors [ 24 ] . This paper considersed virus inhalation and exhalation by for different metabolisms and providesd a balance point taking into considerationing both infection risk and energy consumption based on human activityies in 12 typical indoor environments . An improved infection risk - energy consumption model was developed combining withbased on an improved Wells - Riley model . Optimal interventions for typical indoor environments , considering taking human behavior into account , s were determined by the anti - problem method . The results would be helpful not onlyare useful to for controlling infection risk , but and also to for reducinge energy consumptions due to the pandemic , which is critical for development on sustainable cities and society during the pandemic . 2 . Methods 2 . 1 Improved infection risk estimation model based on airborne transmission The Wells - Riley model ( Eq . ( 1 ) ) is usually frequently used to assess the infection risk via airborne transmission in enclosed environments . ( 1 ) 1 exp C Iqpt P S Q           where P is the probability of infection ; C is the number of infection cases due to the exposure via to airborne transmissionvirus particles ; S is the initial number of the susceptible cases , I is the number of source infectors , q is the quanta generation rate ( quanta / h ) , p is the pulmonary ventilation rate for a person ( m 3 / h ) , t is the exposure time ( h ) , and Q is the room ventilation rate with fresh air ( m 3 / h ) . Besides the steady - state and well - mixed assumptions , the Wells - Riley model also implicitly assumes that accumulation of quanta is a time - independent process where each quantum has a fixed probability ( 63 . 2 % ) of initiating infection [ 25 ] . In this assumption , the probability of infection is only related to the total amounts of inhaled pathogens , but not related to the duration for of exposure . However , from immune effector dynamics , immune particle neutralization of pathogens may create strong time dependence . Temporally temporally clustered pathogens have a better chance of overwhelming the immune particles system than pathogen exposures that occurs at lower levels for longer periods of time [ 23 ] . Hence , this time - independent assumption is not always in line with actual situations and may lead to errors , especially when the exposure period is relatively long . To overcome this limitation of the Wells - Riley model , we introduced the parameter γ to represent the decay rate of the pathogens accumulated in a susceptible person’s respiratory tract , referring according to the previous treatment methods of the dose - response model [ 23 ] , we introduced the parameter γ to represent the decay rate of the pathogens accumulated in susceptible’ respiratory tract . ( 2 ) t t dm m dt   ( 3 ) 0 0 Iq p m Q  where t represents the time after from exposure , m ( t ) represents the total pathogen within the host at a given time . In particular , m 0 represents the initial amount of pathogen that is accumulated in a susceptible person’s respiratory tract . It was found that the viral load in on a COVID - 19 infectors’ throat swabs gradually decreased after symptom onset [ 26 ] . Therefore , the quanta generation rate q , which is assumed to be proportional to the viral load , also decreased with time [ 21 , 27 ] . We thus obtained the fitting mathematical expression of for a COVID - 19 infectors’ time - varying quanta generation rate according to the temporal patterns of the viral shedding curve described in the previous research [ 26 ] . , which This can be found in Appendix A , and as well as the transformational relation between the Ct value and virus load [ 28 ] . ( 4 ) 0 0 . 07 2 t t q q  where q 0 represents the initial quanta generation rate at the symptom onset , and t is the time ( h ) since the symptom onset . As we know , inhalation and exhalation rates depend on the human activityies . Hence , the a change in an infector’s quanta generation rate ( q t ) and a susceptible ' ’s pulmonary ventilation rate ( p ) can have a multiplying eaffect on the infection risk multiply ( Appendix A ) . Combining Eq . ( 1 ) with Eqs . ( 3 - 4 ) , we can obtain the total virus exposure ( m T ) and the modified Wells - Riley model : ( 5 ) ) 0 0 . 07 0 0 2 T t T T t t Iq p e m m dt dt Q      ( 6 ) ) 0 0 . 07 0 2 1 1 t T t T Iq p e dt m Q m C P e e S          where T represents the total exposure time . Infection risk could can be accurately assessed based onusing our modified Wells - Riley model , which considered now considers time - varying infectivity , virus inhalation and exhalation by resulting from human activityies , and vulnerability related to the length of total exposure duration . 2 . 2 Infection risk - energy consumption model To determine the balance optimal point for at which COVID - 19 prevention and energy consumption is balanced , the quantitative relationship between them should needs to be confirmed . We therefore established an iInfection risk - energy consumption model considering That considers human behavior in different indoor environments was established . Under the acceptable infection risk ( R 0 ≤ 1 ) , we investigated the optimal interventions by to obtain the lowest equivalent fresh air ventilation rate ( Section 2 . 2 . 3 ) and energy consumptions ( Section 2 . 2 . 4 ) for each indoor environment on the basis of the improved Wells - Riley model . 2 . 2 . 1 Population groups and typical indoor environments For this studyIn our research , we divided the population into 3 categories : students , workers and older people . All indoor environments were divided into 12 categories : residence A ( during non - working hours ) , residence B ( working hour , while both students and workers do not stay induring working hours ) , indoor workplace , school , sports building , public transport , subway station , restaurant , supermarket , shopping center , wholesale market ( e . g . Xinfadi market , which lead to a serious outbreak in Beijing [ 29 ] ) , and other indoor environments ( e . g . pets markets and home appliance stores ) . Both weekdays and weekends are considered in the study because people’s daily movement differs considerably between these two types of daystimes . The detailed distribution of R 0 on for weekdays and weekends are listed in Tables 1 & 2 . Table 1 . The composition of R 0 ( R 0i means is the reproduction number in for each of the 12 indoor environments i ( 1 to 12 shows 12 typical indoor environments from Rresidence A to Oothers ) ) in different indoor environments for students , workers , and elders on for weekdays and weekends .

In general , an epidemic would generally eventually disappear if R 0 ( the basic reproductive number ) is smaller less than 1 , and control measures which can reduce the reproductive number to less than 1 are regarded as effective [ 30 ] . As patientsSince an infected person would likely stay and infected others in several different places during their infectious period , it is hard to calculate the best R 0 for each indoor environment to ensure thating the final R 0 sis smaller than 1 . To address this problemIn this instance , we have two different ideasapproaches : The first idea approach which we have called the local method , focuses on the a single indoor environment , we called it the local method . Considering the worst conditionsituation , we assumed that the patientsan infected person remains stay in a specific indoor environment for whole the entire infectious period . As the patient’s total infectious period is composed of the corresponding stay time in these indoor environments , hence patient’s actual R0 during the infectious period is made up of the contributions of R0 in different environments . If we can ensure that the R 0 in each indoor environment is below 1 , the final R 0 would be less than 1 no matter the what schedule of people staying follow in different indoor environments . Specific derivation and proof process can be found in Appendix B . In this caseapproach , the specific value of R 0 in each indoor environment is fixed and hence the corresponding epidemic prevention and energy consumption requirements can be determined . The derivation and proof can be found in Appendix B . The second idea approach is a global method . We defined the corresponding number of infected people infected within during the actual duration period when of the original patient ' s infector stayed at in place i as R 0i , which satisfies the following relationship : ( 7 ) 0 0 i R R   Therefore , to make sure that R 0 is no higher than 1 , should be less than or 0 i R  equal to 1 ( Appendix C ) . According to this ideaapproach , the specific value of R 0 in each indoor environment can be variablediffer , which is different fromin contrast to the first idea approach , and provides an opportunity for the global optimization . In the following section , we adopt use these two ideas approaches into in our calculations respectively , with their calculation processes corresponding to the local orly and globally optimal solution ( Fig . 1 ) . We also comprehensively discuss , their results and application are discussed comprehensively as well . 2 . 2 . 3 Equivalent fresh air ventilation rate We adopt the concept of equivalent fresh air ventilation rate , Q , which is expressed as the equivalent volumetric flow of fresh air that would provide the same pathogen removal rates asof the combinedation effects of various non - pharmaceutical interventions . This concept is also referred as the ‘‘equivalent outdoor air” rate in other researches [ 31 ] . From Eq . ( 6 ) , the equivalent fresh air ventilation rate Q i in for each indoor environment cancould be derived : ( 8 ) - 0 0 . 07 0 0 2 ln ( 1 ) ( 1 ) i i t t t i i i t i i i q p e Q dt R S S      ） The total equivalent fresh air ventilation rate ( Q total ) can be calculated according to Eqs . ( 9 - 10 ) , and the detailed derivation can be found in Appendix F : ( 9 ) 12 1 i i i i i i i i N n T N n T     ( 10 ) 12 1 total i i i Q Q     where ω i is the weighting coefficient of place i , ; N i , is the number of indoor environments similar to place i within the urban space studied ; n i , is the average number of people in place i ; T i is the daily open hours of place i . 2 . 2 . 4 Energy consumption The ultimate goal is to find the balance optimal point for at which COVID - 19 prevention ( R 0 ≤ 1 ) and is balanced against energy consumption . The quantitative relationship between actual fresh air ventilation rates ( Q s ) and energy consumption in buildings should be confirmed first . As we know , when supplying providing additional ventilation , besides thean increase in fan power , and increased energy consumption on for heating or cooling load ( Eq . ( 11 ) ) is also necessary to maintain indoor air temperature is needed . The detailed parameters of Eq . ( 11 ) are described in Table 3 .

GB / T 18883 - 2002 , GB50736 - 2012 ) [ 32 ] . In addition , we adopted used a the typical year’s outdoor temperature and humidity data for Beijing , exported from DeST ( https : / / www . dest . net . cn / ) . Considering theSince outdoor temperature and moisture differsence between day and night , we calculated the average outdoor temperature and moisture of for day and night in 12 months respectively ( Appendix D ) . Traditionally , the eElectricity consumption of the a fan W fan ( W ) is conventionally expressed as given by Eq .

From In the concept of global solution approach , the value of R 0i is not fixed , and the values of total energy consumption and equivalent fresh air ventilation rate can be the a function of R 0i . We can determine the ideal value distribution of R 0i values to minimize the total energy consumption or the total equivalent fresh air ventilation rate . Under the concept ofin the globally optimal solution approach , there are two different optimization goals , minimized total equivalent ventilation rate ( mode 2 - 1 ) and minimized total energy consumption ( mode 2 - 2 ) , compared in contrast to the locally optimal solution ( mode 1 ) . On the basis ofEmploying the anti - problem method , our optimization results are the ideal value of R 0i and corresponding constraint conditions should then be established ( Appendix C ) , so as to control the outbreak and calculate the epidemic requirements . Finally , the ideal equivalent fresh air ventilation rate for 12 typical indoor environments could can be determined . The detailed diagrams of this calculation is were shown in Fig . 1 . Fig . 1 . A diagram of the calculation process of equivalent fresh air requirements . 2 . 4 Equivalent and actual fresh air ventilation rate The eEquivalent fresh air ventilation rate was analyzed on the basis of calculated epidemic prevention requirements . On the other hand , the equivalent fresh air ventilation was deduced by non - pharmaceutical interventions ( Eq . ( 18 ) ) , whose detailed derivation can be found in Appendix E .

S . EPA’s guide [ 35 ] and GB 50016 - 2014 [ 36 ] . Moreover , the value of the actual fresh air ventilation rate can be calculated by using Eq . ( 18 ) , while considering the collaboration combined effects of multiple mitigation strategies . In our actual calculation , the combined effect of wearing a mask and supplying fresh air was considered in indoor environments where wearing masks is suitableappropriate . For indoor environments where wearing masks is not suitable , the combined effects of supplying fresh air , using air cleaners and so on , were considered . We can also calculate the maximum equivalent fresh air ventilation rate according to the specific facilities and design situation inof an indoor environment , hence to judge whether and compare it to the previously calculated equivalent fresh air ventilation rate to judge whether it is reasonable .

From the CITY MAPPING platform ( https : / / www . data - dance . com / ) , we obtained the Ddetailed data of Wangjing Blockthis area ( e . g . type and number of buildings , age distribution ) was obtained from the CITY MAPPING platform ( https : / / www . data - dance . com / ) . Based on these datathis , the weighting coefficient of for each indoor environment can was be calculated ( Appendix F ) . 3 . Results 3 . 1 Locally optimal solution Firstly , we focused on the single indoor environment . Considering the worst conditionsituation , it waswe assumed that the COVID - 19 patient stayed remained in the same indoor environment for all the entire infectious period . To ensure this patient would not be the cause of an epidemic outbreak , R 0 for each environment could not be more than 1 . Specifically , pPeople’s pulmonary rates ( pi ) for the different indoor environments were calculated according to the Exposure Factors Handbook of Chinese Population released by Ministry of Environmental Protection of China . And then theThe corresponding equivalent ventilation rate for each indoor environment can then be determined by employing our modified model , as was shown in Table 5 . In this way , the optimal epidemic interventions for each indoor environment , which wasthat we have called the locally optimal solution , can be determined . Table 5 .

It is important to calculate a comprehensive R 0 by conducting interventions ( globally optimality ) . As the optimization target of minimizing the total equivalent ventilation rate , we obtained the ideal R 0 distribution and the minimal equivalent fresh air ventilation rates for different indoor environments on both weekdays and weekends ( Table 6 ) . There are several distinctions differences between the results of for weekends and weekdays . For the calculated minimal equivalent fresh air ventilation rates in on weekends , compared with the results of for weekdays , the a decrease was observed in Residence A ( - 34 % ) , Residence B ( - 44 % ) , Sports building ( - 3 % ) , Public transport ( - 34 % ) , Subway station ( - 31 % ) , Restaurant ( - 32 % ) , and Supermarket ( - 32 % ) while an increase was observed in Shopping center ( 170 % ) , Wholesale market ( 170 % ) and Other ( 170 % ) .

The results of for the two different optimization targets are quite different . On weekdays , the minimal equivalent fresh air ventilation rates for Rresidencet A ( 34 % ) and Sschool ( 76 % ) increased while that for Ssports building ( - 25 % ) , Rrestaurant ( - 67 % ) and Ssupermarket ( - 50 % ) declined .

However , only this result is not enough is hard toprovide guidance fore the epidemic prevention making . At leasta minimus , the actual fresh air ventilation rate was is needed . We separately analyzed two specific cases aiming at minimizing the total equivalent fresh ventilation rate ( mode 2 - 1 ) and total energy consumption ( mode 2 - 2 ) . Surgical mask wearing is one of the most effective measures for COVID - 19 prevention and control [ 38 ] . All 12 indoor environments were classified into two categories , based on whether they were acceptable or appropriate for mask wearing . The amount of fresh air ( Q s ) in those the indoor environments , whichwhere it is appropriate for mask wearing , after considering the mask wearing are listed in Table 8 . For workplace and public transport in weekday and supermarket , shopping center and wholesale market at weekend , their The required fresh air ventilation rates for workplaces and public transport on weekdays and supermarkets , shopping centers and wholesale markets on weekends , are approaching nearly 50 m 3 / h / person , which is higher than other environments , and the current standard of 30 m 3 / h / person in many indoor environments proposed by China Construction Research Institute . In mode 2 - 2 , the calculated results are close similar to that those of mode 1 ( local optimization ) , with only schools and supermarkets showing aed difference at on weekdays , and public transport , shopping centers and wholesale markets showing aed difference at on weekends . Most of the required fresh air ventilation rates are approaching near or below 30 m 3 / h / person , which is not difficult to implementachieve . Table 8 .

For residences , sport buildings and restaurants , where wearing masks is inconvenient or unacceptable , we obtained their final required fresh air ventilation rate after considering the effect of multiple mitigation strategies other than wearing masks ( Table 9 ) . Table 9 . The value of per capita living space ( A i ) and final requirements of fresh air ventilation rates in different indoor environments .

Therefore , it is of great significanceimportant for sports buildings to limit their opening hours and improve epidemic prevention measures , ( e . g . such as regularly carrying out air elimination regularly ) . In the future , Mmasks that are both efficient and suitable for physical exercise might should receive require considerable additional research and development as wellin the future . The required fresh air ventilation rates at weekends are generally lower than that at weekdays . Compared to the results of mode 2 - 1 , fresh air ventilation rates in mode 2 - 2 are generally lower , except for residence A . 3 . 5 Analysis of infection and energy consumption 3 . 5 . 1 R 0 distribution before equivalent ventilation rate optimization In As shown in Fig . 2 , we calculated the value of R 0 value for 3 different groups at the a ventilation rate of 30 m 3 / h / person , which was recommended by China Construction Research Institute . At On weekdays , the R 0 for students , workers and older people are far more greater than 1 . The R 0 contribution of students and older people are mainly from residences . The R 0 for workers is about 5 - 7 times that of students and older people because they spend more time in sports buildings . The R 0 in sports building is 3 - 4 times higher than the total R 0 in other indoor environments . It is obvious that sports building can be very dangerous during the a pandemic , and can be regarded as the key location for possible infection transmission and even potential ‘superspreading’ events . It is necessary to limit the number of people allowed in and their length of stay for sport buildings with regular ventilation , or even close them down if necessary . Compared with weekdays , the R 0 of for students , workers , and older people increased by 900 % , 6 % , and 11 % on weekends , respectively . For students and workers , sports buildings and restaurants are the most dangerous indoor environments , while for older people , residences is are a high - risk area . Fig . 2 . The value of R 0 under when the fresh air ventilation rate of is 30 m 3 / h / person at on ( a ) weekdays and ( b ) weekends . 3 . 5 . 2 Energy consumption under 3 modes Energy consumption presents a bimodal distribution , in winter and summer , energy consumption is relatively high , which is mainly due to the increase of in heating or cooling load caused by large temperature differences between indoor and outdoor air ( Fig . 3 ) . In addition , during the winter and summer months , the energy consumption of the 3 modes were significantly different than in the other months . The difference in energy consumption among 3 modes is also most significant in winter and summer . Mode 1 ( local optimization ) has the highest energy consumption , and mode 2 - 2 ( global optimization , minimized total energy consumption ) has the lowest . Compared with the locally optimal solution ( mode 1 ) , at on weekdays , the energy consumption for the globally optimal solution ( mode 2 - 1 and mode 2 - 2 ) is was reduced by 9 . 4 % and 13 . 7 % respectively . At weekends , the differences between them these modes became more apparent , and the corresponding energy consumption is reduced by 32 . 8 % and 45 . 1 % respectively . Fig . 3 . Energy consumption for 3 different modes at weekday and weekend ( mode1 : local optimization ; mode 2 - 1 : global optimization ( minimized total ventilation rate ; mode 2 - 2 : global optimization ( minimized total energy consumption ) ) . 4 . Discussions In this study , we developed a new approach to determine the optimized COVID - 19 prevention strategies for typical indoor environments that considersing both infection risk and energy consumption . During the COVID - 19 pandemic , many health organizations ( e . g . US CDC ) advised commercial and public sectors to maximize the outdoor air circulation and ventilation rates [ 13 , 39 ] . However , it is still not unclear whether the maximum ventilation rate of using fresh air is excessive or insufficient to meet the needs of pandemic prevention in different indoor environments . , which This uncertainty may lead to high the increased potential of for an infection outbreak or to significant energy consumptions . It is of great significancevery important to know understand the balance between infection spread and energy conservation in different types of indoor environments . The association between ventilation in buildings and the infectious diseases transmission was has been confirmed , however the authors while they failed to quantify the minimum ventilation requirements in buildings to avoid the infectious diseases outbreak via the airborne route , because of they had insufficient data [ 11 ] . Another important reason is that previous researches studies have mainly focused on the probability of infection ( PI ) , but it is difficult to determine the critical safe value of PI because they these studies are were confined to individual or single indoor environments . From the a public health perspective , pandemic prevention should be shifted to reduce infection risk to the level that will stop epidemic growth in a certain region containing that has multiple indoor environments [ 22 ] . The basic reproduction number , R 0 , is used as a parameter with a definite critical value ( R 0 ≤ 1 ) to calculate the minimum ventilation requirements [ 30 ] . Although it is necessary and feasible to determine the fresh air requirements for indoor environment as analyzed above , this task is complex because of the extreme complexity and uncertainty arising from multiple influential influencing factors and their complicated impact on the transmission dynamics of COVID - 19 [ 40 ] . From an infected individual ' s perspective , the viral load in their exhaled aerosols can gradually decrease after symptom onset [ 26 , 41 ] , while however previous researches studies usually used a standard uniform fixed value to represent this parameter , ignoring the fact that its variancea varying viral load can significantly affect the spread of the disease [ 42 ] . From the an indoor environment perspective , inhalation and exhalation rates varied in depending on the different indoor environments [ 43 , 44 ] . In addition , different types of building have their opening hours and allowable number of people , which should be important considerations in the design of specific pandemic interventions [ 40 , 45 ] . Besides , Ddifferent buildings’ pandemic prevention ability can be distinct due to the aging of building equipment and the original design of the buildings ' systems [ 46 ] . Therefore , it is necessary to take the realization methods into consideration to ensure the determined prevention requirements are feasible and realizable . For this purpose , we can take the maximum fresh air ventilation rate that can be achieved as one of the constraint conditions for specific indoor environments , while in our current research , as the corresponding data limited , so this part was not elaborated . As patientsSince an infectious person may stay invisit several places during their infectious period [ 47 ] , we divide assigned typical indoor environments into to 12 categories to seek find their globally optimal solution of for fresh air ventilation rates . However , aAs far as we knowcan determine , the majority of relevant studies are case studies are confined to one , or one type , of indoor environment , and with only a few studies advancing ed their investigation in this mannerto more than one indoor environment [ 13 , 44 , 48 - 50 ] . From the a social perspective , population characteristics ( e . g . people’s movements and activitiesy , the age structure of the population ) , the built environment and spatiotemporal features of city infrastructure need to be simultaneously considered when deploying non - pharmaceutical interventions [ 51 ] . The trend ofpath of a pandemic differs with across regions and stages of the pandemic [ 52 , 53 ] , hence theand interventions should be adjusted accordingly . For example , in China , low - risk , medium - risk and high - risk regions represent the country ' s different epidemic states . Even in the same city , there may be several areas with different levels of risk , where the open requirements of indoor environments and people ' s activities are distinct [ 54 ] . For medium and high - risk areas , as Since the priority for medium and high - risk areas is to suppress the any outbreak quickly , and to minimize the number of people infected as far as possible , the goal is not confined to restricting R 0 < = 1 , but to get R 0 as low as possible , while the paying less attention to energy consumption was less considered . But in the low - risk areas , the priority shifts to avoiding the resurgence and spread of the epidemic , which is a regular task , and the so balancinge of epidemic prevention and energy consumption should be investigated in this instancethese cases . However , Pprevious studies did have not pay paid enough attention on to this [ 21 , 55 ] . In our research , we considered the characteristics of region , stage of the epidemic , and human behavior were considered simultaneously , and the strategies on to control infection control and energy consumption could then be generated developed according to the actual situation . In this research , we investigated the critical epidemic prevention requirements from local ( mode 1 ) and global ( mode 2 - 1 & 2 - 2 ) perspectives , respectively . Interventions on for single indoor environments ( mode 1 ) are not suitable for most environments . However , for places that are relatively isolated from the outside world , or places thatwhere people visit these places relatively infrequently ( e . g . hospitals , prisons ) , we can just treat them as separate individuals , set their critical R 0 as to be 1 and employ use Eq . ( 8 ) to determine their equivalent fresh air ventilation rate . On the other hand , for mode 1 , the locally optimization is not dependent on detailed information of people’s behavior and the indoor environment , hence it is easier to be implemented than the mode 2 - 1 and 2 - 2 . If these detailed data is lacking , the employment of mode 1 to determine the locally optimal solution is a good choice . The calculated results of for mode 1 can be regarded as the a comparative reference for the other modes , so as to analyze the energy - saving potential of globally optimal solutions . For When comparing mode 2 - 1 and 2 - 2 , although the determined epidemic prevention requirements of mode 2 - 2 are the most efficient , their the difference in energy consumption between the two modes is not obvious at for weekdays ( within 5 % ) , especially in the spring and autumn . BesidesIn addition , mode 2 - 2 is based on the information of including comfort preferences and weather conditions , hence the calculation process of for mode 2 - 2 is more complicated . We tTherefore , we suggest that the corresponding calculation mode can be selected according to specific needs and the actual situations . Our research has several limitations . First , our model was developed with the assumption of that airborne transmission dominatesing the infection spread . Second , the data of for initial quanta generation rate ( q 0 ) changed with according to many factors such as environmental parameters , and a constant q 0 would bring introduce some errors . Third , as since some statistical data on concerning people and indoor environments of the investigated city are lacking , we replaced some of them withused estimated values instead , which and this may bring also introduce some errors . Finally , we regard the relationship between ventilation of different buildings and their energy consumption are as consistent , while actually it is a complex matter as it is dependent on the diversity of climates , building types , building characteristics and ventilation systems [ 46 ] . We hope our proposed model can be used as a tool to guide design and operation of building systems to improve health and sustainability . In the future , we will seek to work with relevant agencies to obtain more detailed data to improve the reliability of the results . Moreover , the focus of the indoor environment may shift from pathogens to the average CO 2 concentration and PM concentrations . 5 . Conclusions This paper work developed an infection risk - energy consumption model to find the optimal balance point for bothbetween infection risk and energy conservation . After Following our optimization , the R 0 can be reduced to 1 to curb the pandemic , and the energy consumption can be reduced by 13 . 7 % and 45 . 1 % at on weekdays and weekends , respectively , compared to the strict condition ( R 0 = 1 ) in for each indoor environment throughout the whole infectious period . In this way , we can clarify non - pharmaceutical interventions and develop appropriate energy - efficient strategies for various indoor environments , contributing to curbing the spread of COVID - 19 and maintaining the sustainable development of society .
