The fibrotic microenvironment is characterised by an increased stiffness , with rigidity associated with disease progression . External stiffness is known to promote hepatic stellate cell ( HSC ) activation through mechanotransduction , leading to increased secretion of ECM components . HSCs are key effector cells which maintain the composition of the ECM in health and disease , not only by regulating secretion of ECM proteins such as collagen , but also ECM - degrading enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) and their inhibitors ( TIMPs ) . Uninhibited MMPs degrade ECM proteins to reduce external rigidity . Using fibronectin - coated polyacrylamide gels to alter substrate rigidity without altering ligand density , we show that fibrotic rigidities downregulate MMP - 9 expression and secretion , and also upregulate secretion of TIMP - 1 , though not its expression . Using tissue immunofluorescence studies , we also report that the expression of MMP - 9 is significantly decreased in activated HSCs in fibrotic tissues associated with hepatocellular carcinoma . This suggests the presence of a mechanical network that allows HSCs to maintain a fibrotic ECM , with external rigidity providing feedback which affects MMP - 9 and TIMP - 1 secretion , which may become dysregulated in fibrosis . Liver fibrosis in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is characterised by a remarkable extracellular matrix ( ECM ) stiffness , with extensive deposition and cross - linking of extracellular proteins , including fibrillar and base - ment membrane collagens . These proteins are primarily secreted by activated hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) , myofibroblast - like cells that remodel the extracellular matrix and drive fibrosis in a disease state 1 , 2 . In healthy liver tissue , hepatic stellate cells reside in a quiescent state with cytoplasmic vitamin A - rich droplets , a low number of mitochondria , and a distinct rough endoplasmic reticulum . Following liver injury , HSCs become activated , and in addition to increased production of collagen and other ECM proteins , lose their vitamin A - rich droplets and become increasingly contractile and proliferative . Activated HSCs are also associated with increased inflamma - tory signalling and altered matrix degradation , all of which can contribute to perpetuation of fibrosis 3 , 4 . HSCs have a key role in remodelling and maintaining the ECM , and achieve this through secretion of ECM proteins such as collagen , as well as ECM - degrading enzymes known as matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) . MMPs are calcium - dependent zinc - containing peptidases and are responsible for the degradation and turnover of most components in the ECM , including collagen 5 . Quiescent HSCs maintain ECM homeostasis by balancing the extracellular proteolytic activity of MMPs with the production of ECM proteins , but when HSCs are acti - vated in disease or following injury , excess collagen production and altered matrix degradation leads to a stiff fibrotic state 6 . In fibrosis resolution , increased activity of MMPs leads to collagen degradation and ECM soften - ing , with consequent reversion of activated HSCs to their quiescent phenotype .

MMP activity can be regulated at multiple levels , such as transcription , translation , and regulation of pro - enzyme activation 7 . Additionally , cells can secrete tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ) that inhibit the activity of MMPs outside the cell . Different MMPs are inhibited by different TIMPs in a complex interaction network and therefore the specific balance of MMPs with their cognate TIMPs dictates the activity of the extracellular MMP pool . For example , TIMP - 1 reacts with the zymogen form of MMP - 9 8 . TIMPs bind to MMPs through both their N and C terminal domains . The N - terminal domain of TIMPs leads to MMP inhibi - tion by chelating the zinc ion in the active site of MMPs . The C terminal domain binds with high affinity to the haemopexin domains of MMPs , and this interaction is likely to be inhibitory 9 . The pathological state of fibrosis is associated with an increased matrix stiffness due to the altered compo - sition of the ECM , with stiffness dependent on both collagen abundance and cross - linking 10 . This increased rigidity is detected by HSCs through cell surface receptors known as integrins , leading to HSC activation 11 – 13 . HSC - mediated remodelling is a key process in ECM homeostasis , and it is known that the ECM can regulate its own composition through biochemical regulation of the secretion profile of resident fibroblasts 14 . Since many signalling pathways in HSCs have been shown to be highly mechanosensitive , e . g . rigidity inhibiting the HNF4 α transcriptional network 11 or integrin - mediated activation of YAP 13 , it is likely that external rigidity from fibrosis may affect HSC - mediated ECM remodelling at the protein expression and secretion levels . The matrix remodel - ling proteins matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( MMP - 2 ) and 9 ( MMP - 9 ) are two key MMPs secreted from HSCs that degrade collagen 15 , and a sensitivity of MMP and TIMP secretion by HSCs to external rigidity may underlie an important feedback loop that regulates the composition of the ECM in fibrosis . To investigate the role of matrix stiffness on the function of MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 and TIMP - 1 , we cultured HSCs on substrates of varying rigidity ( 4 , 12 and 25 kPa ) , mimicking healthy and fibrotic liver tissue stiffnesses 16 . We then assayed changes in mRNA and protein expression and secretion of MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 , and TIMP - 1 in response to external stiffness to analyse the possible mechanotransduction network that surrounds MMP - mediated ECM homeostasis . We have tested the hypothesis that the rigid environment created by fibrosis can modulate the expression and secretion of proteins , specifically MMP - 9 and TIMP - 1 , to alter the ECM in either resolution or perpetuation of fibrosis . Our results indicate that rigidity promotes the perpetuation of fibrosis as external stiff - ness downregulates the activity of MMP - 9 . Results Substrate rigidity inhibits MMP - 9 gene expression . Fibrosis in the liver is associated with specific rigidities , as determined through ultrasound based transient elastography . Liver stiffness values below 6 kPa are designated as normal , with values around 8 – 12 kPa designated as advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis . Further disease progressions including portal hypertension and esophageal varices have been shown to increase the stiffness to greater than 20 kPa 16 . We hypothesized that substrate stiffness would affect MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 and TIMP - 1 gene expression . To alter substrate stiffness without altering ligand density , we fabricated fibronectin - coated polyacrylamide substrates , where rigidity could be tuned by altering the ratio of acrylamide to bis - acrylamide . Since we coated these sub - strates with the same amount of fibronectin , the ligand density was constant across samples so only the effect of rigidity was observed . We chose 4 , 12 , and 25 kPa rigidities to represent the progression from healthy to fully developed liver fibrosis , based on in vivo measurements 16 . HSCs were cultured on these polyacrylamide substrates of tuneable rigidity for 24 hours . We observed that HSCs became more elongated and less rounded with increas - ing rigidity ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . After cell collection , we used reverse transcription quantitative PCR to assess the relative mRNA levels of the target genes ( Fig . 1 ) . GAPDH was chosen as a suitable housekeeping gene for normalization as its expression was unaffected by stiffness ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . We observed that the expression of MMP - 2 remained unchanged across rigidities . Interestingly , we observed that on 12 and 25 kPa substrates , expression of MMP - 9 was greatly reduced in comparison to the 4 kPa substrate , indicating that MMP - 9 expression is sensitive to external rigidity through mechanotransduction . Similar to MMP - 2 , we observed that substrate stiffness did not significantly affect the TIMP - 1 expression . Substrate rigidity inhibits intracellular protein levels of MMP - 9 and TIMP - 1 . The same experimental setup described in the previous section was used for Western Blot analysis , and performed to assess the intracellu - lar protein expression of MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 and TIMP - 1 across different substrate rigidities ( Fig . 2 , Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Though all these proteins have extracellular roles , the mechanical sensitivity of their intracellular protein abundance would indicate the breadth of the mechanotransduction network , and its ability to affect multiple points in ECM homeostasis signalling . The intracellular protein amount of MMP - 2 was unchanged with increasing rigidity , equivalent to the trend observed in mRNA expression . Also , in agreement with mRNA expression , we observed a marked and significant decrease ( around 50 % ) of intracellular MMP - 9 protein as rigidity increased from 4 to 25 kPa . Intriguingly , we observed a significant decrease of 40 % in the intracellular protein levels for TIMP - 1 when rigidity was increased from 4 to 25 kPa , despite our observation that TIMP - 1 mRNA levels were unresponsive to stiffness . This suggested to us a further mechanism by which TIMP - 1 intracellular protein levels are regulated . Substrate rigidity modulates the activity of secreted MMP - 9 and TIMP - 1 . To learn more about the effect of matrix rigidity on the target enzyme’s extracellular activity and to gain a more complete insight into the multi - level regulation of these proteins , we performed enzyme activity assays ( Fig . 3 , Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . After 24 hours of culture on 4 , 12 or 25 kPa substrates , cell culture medium was changed to serum free medium 3 Scientific RepoRts | ( 2019 ) 9 : 7299 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 019 - 43759 - 6 www . nature . com / scientificreports www . nature . com / scientificreports / for the next 24 hours and then collected for further examination . This medium therefore contained any secreted MMPs and TIMPs . Gelatin zymography was performed to assay MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 activity , where band inten - sity represents level of degradation . The inhibitory activity of TIMP - 1 on MMP - 9 was assayed by reverse gelatin zymography , where band intensity represents level of TIMP - 1 activity i . e . inhibition of degradation . Recombinant MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 were used in adjacent lanes to confirm the position of MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 mediated deg - radation within the gel . MMP - 2 activity was constant on each substrate , in line with levels of mRNA and protein expression , showing a lack of mechanosensitivity . MMP - 9 activity significantly decreased with increasing rigidity , with the 25 kPa condition showing 25 % less activity than the 4 kPa condition . These observations are consistent with the previous results indicating that rigid substrates decreased MMP - 9 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels , and this trend is continued through secretion . Furthermore , we investigated TIMP - 1 activity and observed that it was significantly increased for 12 and 25 kPa substrate - cultured cells . These findings contrast with the decreased levels of intracellular TIMP - 1 when rigidity increases . This difference suggests that the lower intracellular levels of TIMP - 1 seen at 12 and 25 kPa may be caused by the higher TIMP - 1 secretion observed at these rigidities , which depletes the intracellular pool but enriches the extracellular pool of TIMP - 1 . TIMP - 1 knockdown promotes extracellular MMP - 9 activity . Since we observed TIMP - 1 activity to increase in response to increased matrix rigidity using reverse zymography , we next quantitatively verified the relevance of this change in TIMP - 1 activity with HSCs . We transfected HSCs with TIMP - 1 siRNA to knockdown TIMP - 1 ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) , and assessed the enzyme activity of MMP - 9 , to indicate how TIMP - 1 directly affects the MMP - 9 activity of the cells . We observed a significant increase in MMP - 9 activity of around 40 % when TIMP - 1 siRNA was used ( Fig . 4 ) , indicating that secreted TIMP - 1 does indeed regulate MMP - 9 activity in these Figure 1 .

The large change in MMP - 9 activity we saw emphasises the importance of our observations that levels of both MMP - 9 and TIMP - 1 are mechanosensitive . MMP - 9 is downregulated in HCC . Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is characterised by fibrosis , with high levels of extracellular matrix proteins . This fibrosis is maintained within the disease state , often through upregula - tion of ECM protein production . Although it is known that upregulation of MMP - 9 occurs with progression from healthy liver to HCC 17 , the reported correlation between MMP - 9 and HCC progression is related to the whole liver , and is not specific to HSCs . We therefore tested whether downregulation of MMPs occurs in HSCs in HCC , and would therefore promote the maintenance of the fibrotic stroma . Figure 3 .

Activated stellate cells were pres - ent in both healthy and HCC tissues , though at a lower level in healthy tissue ( Fig . 5 ) . This increased presence of α - SMA in HCC correlates with previous studies that link α - SMA expression to HCC progression 18 . We observed significantly lower levels of MMP - 9 in activated HSCs in tissues from HCC patients than in healthy control patients , where the expression of MMP - 9 in the activated HSCs present in HCC patients was almost negligible ( Fig . 5 ) . This indicates that one of the methods by which HCC may promote the disease state is through inhibition of MMP - 9 , which would otherwise degrade ECM components that contribute to fibrosis . Discussion Remodelling of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) is a common occurrence in many processes that occur in the healthy liver , including wound healing and morphogenesis , and includes the regulated secretion of proteases that degrade the components of the ECM 19 . In disease states , including fibrotic diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , stromal remodelling is deregulated and the altered ECM influences disease progression 20 . An understanding of the sensitivity of remodelling enzymes , such as matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , to charac - teristics of this fibrotic ECM , such as rigidity , is of vital importance in understanding the disease 21 . We reveal that fibrotic matrix stiffness can decrease the activity of extracellular MMP - 9 in vitro , and achieves this through downregulation of MMP - 9 at the gene expression level . Furthermore , rigidity promotes secretion of TIMP - 1 , without affecting its gene expression ( Fig . 6 ) . This suggests a positive feedback loop in which the stiffness aspect of fibrosis , through mechanosignalling , promotes fibrosis perpetuation by inhibiting MMPs that catalyse ECM degradation . We observe evidence for this feedback loop at rigidities comparable to those in liver fibrosis 16 . The in vivo environment for HSCs is much more complex than our in vitro environment , where a multitude of biochemical and mechanical stimuli may promote or inhibit our proposed pro - fibrotic positive feedback loop . Our results are limited in that only the in vitro effect of matrix stiffness is analysed , and should therefore be com - bined with future studies which analyse the role of other aspects of fibrosis , such as changes in ECM architecture , to fully resolve the mechanisms surrounding MMP - 9 and TIMP - 1 regulation . Though mechanisms that maintain MMP - 9 and TIMP - 1 levels in healthy homeostasis are not investigated here , we propose that in softer environments , the signalling pathways that modulate MMP - 9 and TIMP - 1 activity in response to high stiffness are not activated . Since we still observe MMP - 9 expression at 25 kPa , albeit signifi - cantly reduced , this indicates that mechanotransduction of a soft substrate only partly promotes expression . In vitro , components of the cell culture medium likely promote a basal level of expression with further activation if the cell is on a soft environment . In vivo , the complex extracellular milieu also provides a wealth of possible sig - nalling pathways promoting a basal level of expression , with external rigidity as an influencing factor .

By using an in vitro system whereby culture conditions only differ in sub - strate rigidity , any difference in phenotype can only be described as a product of mechanotransduction . Though cells can also sense a soft environment through mechanotransduction , our results indicate that the activity of remodelling enzymes is sensitive to external rigidity . Mechanosensing of rigid substrates plays an important role in the progression of other cancers such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 23 , as well as diseases such as cardiac hypertrophy and muscular dystrophy 24 . Therefore , the positive feedback system we observe , i . e . increasing rigidity inhibits expression of MMP - 9 , may underlie the perpetuation of fibrosis in the liver . The understanding of this previously unobserved mechanical network may have therapeutic applications , as drugs could be used that target either MMPs or TIMPs , or the specific proteins that link the mechanical envi - ronment to MMP or TIMP regulation . Overexpression of MMP - 9 has been seen in animal models of abdominal aortic aneurysms , and treatment with doxycycline has been shown to downregulate this expression 25 , suggesting the applicability of MMP - 9 modulation in therapeutic approaches to other diseases . Therapeutics have also been developed against components of mechanosignalling networks 26 , and therefore our results could be applicable in guiding therapeutic development that seeks to reduce fibrosis in the liver , by targeting the mechanical network linking the fibrotic environment to the mechanosensitive proteins that can degrade it . Our results reveal the mechanosensitivity of MMP - 9 expression and secretion , as well as secretion of its inhib - itor TIMP - 1 . This suggests a mechanosensitive feedback network in which the rigid environment of fibrosis can prevent its own degradation by downregulating the activity of a protease that would otherwise degrade it . Materials and Methods Tissues microarrays . Tissue microarray ( TMA ) blocks were constructed as previously described 27 using 20 archival paraffin - embedded HCC tissue blocks and 10 healthy controls retrieved from the Imperial College London Tissue Bank ( Ethical Approval nr . R15058 ) . A consultant histopathologist reviewed all the materials prior to inclusion on freshly cut hematoxylin & eosin ( H & E ) slides . We constructed TMA blocks using an MTA - 1 Microarrayer ( Mitogen , UK ) following H & E - slide guided microdissection of target tumour and surrounding non - tumorous areas . We obtained triplicates of 1 mm cores from separate central and peripheral areas of tumor and matching surrounding liver . Adequate sampling of target tissues was confirmed on a freshly cut H & E section from the recipient TMA block before downstream analysis Cell culture . Primary culture - activated human hepatic stellate cells ( passage 3 – 6 , HHStec # 5300 – ScienCell ) were cultured at 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 in culture medium containing DMEM / Nutrient Mixture F - 12 Ham ( D8437 , Sigma ) , 10 % FBS ( 10270 - 106 , Gibco ) , 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( Sigma Aldrich , USA ) and 1 % fungizone ( 15290 - 026 , Gibco ) . For the polyacrylamide substrate experiments , HSCs were detached from culture flasks with trypsin and i ) seeded on polyacrylamide gels with different rigidities for zymography ( or immunofluorescence ) staining ; ii ) transfected with TIMP - 1 siRNA on glass for MMP - 9 zymography .

After achieving the desired destaining grade , zymography = transparent , digested bands and blue background , reverse zymography = clear background and blue bands , the gel was photographed with a UVP Biospectrum 500 Imaging System . Band digestion intensity , representing potential MMPs activity , was calculated using the ImageJ densitometry plugin . 8 Scientific RepoRts | ( 2019 ) 9 : 7299 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 019 - 43759 - 6 www . nature . com / scientificreports www . nature . com / scientificreports / Immunostaining . For α - SMA and MMP - 9 staining , FFPE blocks were sectioned , deparaffinised and rehy - drated as described previously 29 . Antigen retrieval was performed by incubating the sections in boiling citrate buffer ( pH 6 ) for 45 minutes and cooled down at room temperature for 25 minutes . α - SMA antibody ( Abcam , UK , ab7817 , 1 / 50 ) , MMP - 9 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc - 10737 , 1 / 50 ) and secondary goat anti - mouse AlexaFluor 488 ( Life Technologies , Paisley , UK ; A - 11029 , 1 / 200 ) and goat anti - rabbit AlexaFluor 546 ( Life Technologies , Paisley , UK ; A - 11003 , 1 / 200 ) . Antibodies were used following the abcam TBS based staining protocol ( https : / / www . abcam . com / protocols / immunostaining - paraffin - frozen - free - floating - protocol ) . Stained sections were mounted with ProLong ® Gold Antifade with DAPI ( Life Technologies , USA ) . Images from immunofluorescence staining were acquired using a Nikon Ti - e microscope . Mean fluorescence intensity was quantified using Fiji software by measuring the mean grey value in the MMP - 9 channel for the randomly selected regions showing α - SMA positive staining . The values obtained from the different regions of the same tissue sections were averaged and treated as one experimental replicate . The final result was calculated for n = 20 HCC and 10 healthy patients per condition . Statistics . Results were analyzed using Prism software ( GraphPad , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . A 2 - tailed Student’s t test for unpaired data was used to calculate the difference between mean values , * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 . References 1 .
