The most accepted hypothesis is that IBS is the result of the disturbance of the ‘brain - gut axis . ’ Although the pathophysiological mechanisms of intestinal dysfunction are complex and not completely understood , stress , infections , gut flora , and altered immune response are thought to play a role in IBS development . The intestinal barrier , composed of a single - cell layer , forms a physical barrier that separates the intestinal lumen from the internal milieu . The loss of integrity of this barrier is related with mucosal immune activation and intestinal dysfunction in IBS . The number of mast cells and T lymphocytes is increased in the intestinal mucosa of certain IBS patients , and the mediators released by these cells could compromise the epithelial barrier function and alter nerve signaling within the enteric nervous system . The association of clinical symptoms to structural and functional abnormali - ties of the mucosal barrier in IBS patients highlights the importance of understanding the physiological role of the gut barrier in the pathogenesis of this disorder . This review sum - marizes the clinical and experimental evidences indicating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of IBS symptomatol - ogy , and its relevance for future translational research .

Loss of molecular and functional integrity leading to disturbed epithelial barrier and subsequent activation of muco - sal immune responses is closely related to the pathogenesis of many intestinal disorders , 1 , 2 including irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) . Although reckoned as multifactorial , current understanding of IBS origin and underlying mediators and mechanisms is still fragmentary , but today IBS is thought to be the result of the dysregulation of the interaction between the central and the en - teric nervous system , the so - called brain - gut axis . 3 The mecha - nisms behind this disturbance are not clear but a plausible hypothesis postulates that the breakdown of intestinal epithelial barrier’s surveillance is a key mechanism in the development of symptoms compatible with IBS . Evidence has evolved from in vivo data showing increased intestinal permeability in IBS pa - tients , 4 - 7 being more pronounced in those diarrhea predominant IBS ( IBS - D ) 4 patients ( Table 1 ) . In line with these observations , converging reports have revealed the presence of low - grade inflammation and immune activation 8 - 10 and impaired barrier function 11 - 13 in the intestinal mucosa of certain IBS subgroups as a leading events in the origin and severity of visceral hypersen - sitivity and bowel dysfunction in IBS . In these patients , the in - flammatory infiltrate is dominated by increased populations of mast cells 9 , 10 which have been implicated in intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction , mainly through modulation of tight junc - tion ( TJ ) proteins , resulting in increased permeability through the paracellular pathway in the intestinal epithelium . In this review we summarize clinical and experimental evi - dence indicating molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying mucosal barrier dysfunction , associated with clinical symptoms in IBS . 306 Gut and Liver , Vol . 6 , No . 3 , July 2012 INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL BARRIER FUNCTION The gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract constitutes one of the largest surface areas that is exposed to and interacts with the external environment . To assure homeostasis , the intestinal epithelium faces a unique challenge to balance the requirements of form - ing a protective barrier to separate the intestinal lumen from the underlying tissue while simultaneously supporting the absorp - tion of nutrients and water across the epithelial barrier . Several immune and nonimmune defense mechanisms have evolved to fence off the continuous luminal threats . These mechanisms are organized into two coordinated levels of protection and include immune ( epithelial and immune cells ) as well as nonimmune components ( gut motility , mucus layer , and secretion of water ) . These elements are thoroughly interconnected and defects in any of them can result in barrier dysfunction , altered intestinal permeability , eventually leading to inflammatory processes . At the same time , small amounts of antigens are allowed to penetrate the epithelial barrier favoring the induction of im - mune tolerance mechanisms . This transport of molecules from the intestinal lumen to the lamina propria can occur through two main routes : the paracellular pathway , which involves pas - sive movement of small molecules ( < 600 Da ) through the space between adjacent epithelial cells ; and the transcellular pathway , which involves both active and passive movement of larger molecules across epithelial cell membranes , usually involving the action of specific transport channels and endocytotic mech - anisms mediated or not by specific membrane receptors . 1 . Mucosal barrier components 1 ) Extracellular components of the intestinal barrier The intestinal mucosal surface is covered with a layer of mu - cins and lipids that limit the exposure of the monolayer of in - testinal epithelial cells to sheer forces and other physical trauma from particles within the lumen , and also prevents direct con - tact of the epithelium with microorganisms . 14 The mucus layer provides the first protection against luminal microorganisms and contributes to the retention of mucosal secretions rich in antibacterial peptides ( such as cathelicidins and defensins ) and immunoglobulin A which binds , aggregates , or destroys bac - teria preventing their adherence to the mucosa and subsequent transepithelial invasion . 15 , 16 Emerging evidence have shown that defensins are not only required to fight invading pathogens , but also participate in modulating microbiota composition and , hence , shaping adaptive immune responses . 17 In addition , the high turnover of epithelial cells and intestinal peristalsis together with massive water secretion in response to pathogenic stimulus are also essential factors of the intestinal barrier function . 2 ) Cellular components of the intestinal barrier The cellular components of the intestinal barrier consist of a complex array of cell types present within the epithelium : absorptive enterocytes , mucus - producing goblet cells , entero - endocrine cells that produce peptide hormones and Paneth cells involved in secretion of antimicrobial peptides . In addition , both innate and adaptive immune cells , mainly T and B lymphocytes , immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) - secreting plasma cells , mast cells , den - dritic cells , and macrophages are present at steady state and in - teract together to maintain a balanced immune response against intestinal antigens aimed at preserving gut homeostasis . Intestinal epithelial cells also contribute to the mucosal im - mune surveillance through the expression of a wide range of pattern recognition receptors , such as toll - like receptor ( TLR ) and intracellular nucleotide - binding oligomerization domain ( NOD ) - like receptors . 18 Signaling through NODs and TLRs is regulated by intestinal microbiota and its activation in entero - cytes and Paneth cells leads to the expression and release of antimicrobial peptides . 15 These molecules participate actively in the intestinal host - microbial homeostasis reinforcing the barrier function . In addition , the enterocytes are able to act as non - professional antigen presenting cells and communicate to and modulate diverse underlying populations of intestinal immu - nocytes . Indeed , epithelial cells are able to release several che - mokines and cytokines involved in neutrophil and macrophage recruitment ( CXC - chemokine ligand [ CXCL ] - 1 and CXCL - 2 ) Table 1 .

Martínez C , et al : Intestinal Barrier Dysfunction in the Irritable Bowel Syndrome 307 and in the regulation of the inflammatory potential of dendritic cells ( thymic stromal lymphopoietin ) . Furthermore , recognition of bacteria through TLRs could also account for the production of CD40 - independent IgA class switch recombination - inducing signals such as B - cell activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) family and proliferation - inducing ligand by epithe - lial cells . The dysregulation of this immunomodulatory function of the intestinal epithelial cells might contribute to both , the loss of tolerogenic mechanisms and the induction of inflammatory responses , ultimately leading to the development of intestinal inflammation . 19 2 . The apical juntional complex The epithelial cells within the intestinal epithelium form a continuous , polarized monolayer where the individual cell membranes are connected together through the apical junc - tional complex . This intercellular complex is composed of TJ , adherens junctions , and desmosomes , as well as gap junctions for cell - to - cell communication ( Fig . 1 ) . 1 ) TJs Intestinal permeability to small , water - soluble molecules is determined by TJs , which seal the paracellular spaces between the epithelial cells lining the lumen of the gut . TJs are the major constituents of the apical junctional complex , located at the most luminal site of the epithelium . TJs act as both a gate that limits the paracellular transport of ions and the translocation of luminal antigens ( microorganisms and their toxins ) , and a fence that separates the plasma membrane into the apical and baso - lateral domains . 1 TJs are multi - protein complexes composed of transmembrane proteins ( occludin , claudins , and junctional adhesion molecule ) and peripheral membrane ( scaffolding ) proteins ( zonula oc - cludens [ ZO ] ) ( Fig . 2 ) . The structural and functional integrity of the TJ depends on the presence of a peri - junctional ring of actin and myosin , which also contributes to the regulation of para - cellular permeability . Indeed , contraction of the peri - junctional cytoskeleton induced after phosphorylation of myosin light chain ( MLC ) has been shown to lead to enhanced permeability in intestinal epithelia . 20 It is believed that the tension resulting from this contraction is transmitted to the lateral membranes of adjacent epithelial cells perturbing , thereby , TJ barrier function . Occludin was the first transmembrane protein to be dis - covered at the TJ ; however , its function is not yet fully delin - eated . Despite occludin being an important constituent of TJs , in occludin knockout animals , TJ assembly and paracellular permeability remained unchanged . 21 , 22 However , a detailed characterization suggested that occludin play a role in the regu - lation of TJ integrity rather than in the de novo assembly of the TJ . 21 Furthermore , in vitro data suggests that TJ assembly , transepithelial resistance , and localization of occludin to the TJ are regulated by phosphorylation . 23 , 24 In homeostasis , occludin is highly phosphorylated on Ser and Thr residues , while phos - phorylation of Tyr residues is kept at minimum . This hyperphos - phorylated occludin is selectively located at the TJ . However , during the disruption of TJs , in response to various stimuli , oc - cludin undergoes dephosphorylation at Ser / Thr residues , which results in redistribution of the protein from the membrane to the cytoplasm . 24 The precise role of Tyr - phosphorylation in TJ disruption is not clear at present , but it has been suggested that it may attenuate the interaction between occludin and ZO pro - teins , leading to the disruption of the TJ . 25 Fig . 1 .

Just below the base of the microvilli ( Mv ) , the plasma membranes of adjacent cells are in intimate contact at the tight junction ( TJ ) , followed by the adherens junction ( AJ ) and desmosomes ( D ) . Bar , 1 m m ; amplified area bar , 150 nm . Fig . 2 . Molecular components of the tight junction . Tight junctions are composed of integral transmembrane proteins ( claudins , occludin and junctional adhesion molecules [ JAM ] - A , - B and - C ) that interact in the paracellular space with proteins on adjacent cells . These trans - membrane proteins are connected to the actomyosin cytoskeleton filaments through scaffolding proteins ( zonula occludens [ ZO ] [ ZO - 1 , ZO - 2 , and ZO - 3 ] ) . 308 Gut and Liver , Vol . 6 , No . 3 , July 2012 The observation that barriers can develop in the absence of occludin 22 prompted a continued search of essential barrier - forming components of the TJ leading to the identification of the claudin family of transmembrane proteins , which consists of 24 members between 20 and 27 kDa in size . Claudins play a central role in the coordination of barrier function and their differential expression and properties appear to determine the tissue - specific variations in electrical resistance and paracellular ionic selectivity . 26 The functional characterization of single clau - dins has identified specific contributions to the barrier properties in the different epithelia of the organism . Some claudins form pores that allow preferential passage of specific ions , while other claudins contribute to strengthening the barrier by preventing the passage of specific ions ( Table 2 ) . Within the intestine , the ion - selective properties of the paracellular barrier vary consid - erably between the individual segments due to their specific physiological function showing an overall decrease in perme - ability towards the distal ends of the GI tract . 27 Similarly , the ability of intestinal epithelial TJ to discriminate and restrict pas - sage of solutes based on size varies along the crypt - villus axis . 28 At the molecular level , this is achieved thanks to the segment - specific expression of different claudins ( Table 2 ) . Thus , barrier properties along the intestinal epithelium , and along the crypt - villus axis , are in accordance with the localization of claudins . Studies in the human intestine have revealed the expression of tightening claudin - 1 , - 3 , - 4 , - 5 , and - 7 in the ileum and colonic mucosa , 29 , 30 with barely detectable expression of the permeabil - ity mediator claudin - 2 restricted to the colonic crypts . 30 , 31 How - ever , claudin - 2 expression has been detected in both , the crypt and the villus of the small bowel . 31 This change in the expres - sion and distribution of claudins may respond to the specific physiological function carried out by the intestinal epithelium along the intestine , as it has to guarantee the absorption of fluid and nutrients in the small bowel while protecting against a vast amount of luminal antigens from the resident microbiota in the colon . The TJ transmembrane proteins , claudins and occludin , are structurally associated to the cytoskeleton , and are composed of actin , myosin II and other proteins , through the scaffolding proteins ZO . 32 This association to the peri - junctional actomyosin ring , which encircles the cell at the apical surface , is crucial for the dynamic regulation of paracellular permeability . Interest - ingly , simultaneous elimination of ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 expression prevents claudin recruitment , TJ formation and development of epithelial barrier function . 33 Although a large number of other TJ - associated proteins have been also identified , the manner by which they interact to form the selectively permeable barrier is not fully defined . Alterations in these structural and regulatory TJ proteins have been linked to barrier dysfunction and increased intestinal permeability in response to a broad range of inflammatory and infectious stim - uli . 1 However , the molecular mechanisms by which TJ - related proteins alter paracellular permeability in specific intestinal dis - eases require further investigation . INTESTINAL PERMEABILITY REGULATION Far from being a static element , the epithelial barrier function is incredibly dynamic and functionally responsive to several physiologic , pathologic , and pharmacologic stimuli . Thus , the intestinal TJ are constantly being restructured by dietary factors , neuro - humoral signaling , inflammatory mediators and a variety of cellular signaling pathways which , in turn , are susceptible of being usurped by pathogenic bacteria to gain access to the in - testinal mucosa . 22 Regulation of intestinal permeability involves different func - tional pathways . Fast changes in permeability occur via MLC kinase ( MLCK ) - mediated cytoskeleton contraction and by en - docytosis of TJ proteins , 34 , 35 whereas more lasting permeability disturbances involve the transcriptional modulation of TJ pro - teins , epithelial cell apoptosis and structural alterations in the epithelium . 36 MLCK is a Ca 2 + - calmodulin - dependent Ser - Thr kinase that specifically phosphorylates MLC in response to both physiologi - cal and pathological stimuli . 37 , 38 Phosphorylation of MLC results in a conformational change that triggers the contraction of the actomyosin cytoskeleton leading to epithelial barrier dysfunction . In addition , MLCK activity is also involved in the endocytosis of occludin in response to the pro - inflammatory mediator TNF . This TNF - induced occludin internalization has been reported to be specifically mediated by caveolae endocytosis highlighting the role of vesicular traffic pathways in intestinal TJ regulation in response to cytokine - mediated barrier dysfunction . 39 In vivo functional assessment of the intestinal epithelial bar - Table 2 .

A complete discussion of all the mechanisms involved in the regulation of intestinal permeability is beyond the scope of this article but a few deserve closer attention as they are important in our current understanding of IBS pathogenesis ( Table 3 ) . REGULATION OF INTESTINAL BARRIER FUNCTION IN IBS 1 . Stress - induced intestinal barrier dysfunction Stress , either physical or psychological , represents a threat to the internal homeostasis . In response to stress , a coordinated autonomic , endocrine , and immune response is generated to maintain stability . However , excessive stress exposure , in sus - ceptible individuals , impairs this adaptive response , eventually predisposing those subjects to the development of new diseases or to the exacerbation of previously existing ones . 44 This may be the case of IBS as epidemiological , empirical , and clinical observations have related stressful or traumatic life events with symptom onset , severity , and persistence in certain IBS sub - types . 45 In fact , around 50 % of IBS patients present comorbidity with psychiatric disorders , commonly anxiety and depression , 46 and suffer more chronic stress than the healthy population . 10 The core system of the stress response involves the hypotha - lamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis and the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system . The latter mediates brain - gut communication through the enteric nervous system , modulating and coordinating GI motility , secretion , and immune function . The release of corticotropin releasing factor ( CRF ) from the hy - pothalamus in response to activation of the HPA promotes the synthesis of corticotropin in the pituitary gland , which stimu - lates the adrenal cortex to release cortisol that finally circulate in the blood reaching every tissue and facilitating the coordina - tion of brain and peripheral functions . The effects of stress on gut function are universal ; however , IBS patients appear to have enhanced reactivity to stress compared to healthy subjects re - garding to intestinal motility , sensitivity and permeability , and Table 3 .

Indeed , both acute and chronic stress , have been shown to increase ion and water secretion and intestinal permeability in the jejunum and the colon of laboratory animals . 48 - 50 These changes were paralleled by a marked increase in epithelial macromolecular permeability 48 and were mimicked by the intraperitoneal injec - tion of CRF through mast cells and neural pathways . 48 , 51 In addi - tion , studies using segmental perfusion techniques in the human jejunum have revealed that acute stress , either psychological or physical , reduced net water absorption 52 or increased secre - tion . 53 Moreover , in healthy volunteers , an excessive exposure to stressful life events determines an abnormal jejunal epithelial response to incoming acute stressful stimuli . 54 This abnormal response indicates the loss of regulatory mechanisms and may represent an initial step in the development of prolonged mu - cosal dysfunction , a finding that could be linked to IBS etiopa - thology . 2 . Cellular mechanisms of intestinal barrier function in IBS Although epithelial cells represent the primary cellular de - terminant of the epithelial barrier function , in the GI tract the properties of the intestinal barrier are not intrinsic to epithelial cells but also induced by interactions with the immune tissue ( Fig . 3 ) . Immune cells are associated with the physical barrier to provide immunity at entry sites . In the GI tract , immune cells reside both within the epithelium and in the lamina propria and their movement into the gut lumen is regulated to preserve ho - meostasis and to avoid inflammation in response to microbial - associated inflammatory stimuli and to induce tolerance toward food antigens . 55 A growing number of independent studies have revealed a mucosal pathobiological substrate , a process of low - grade in - flammation and immune activation , common to the intestine of certain IBS subgroups . 8 , 9 Notably , the inflammatory infiltrate is dominated by mast cells and T lymphocytes , 10 , 56 cells that have been largely implicated in stress and infectious intestinal barrier dysfunction , and in the generation of intestinal motor abnor - Fig . 3 . Neuro - immune regulation of intestinal barrier function . In the intestinal mucosa , mast cells are strategically located in close proximity to epithelial cells and nerve endings , establishing a bidirectional communication through the release of specific mediators . In addition , mast cells can recruit and activate other immune cells . The interaction of all these elements is crucial to assure an appropriate intestinal barrier homeostatic balance . However , chronic stimulation and the consequent release of inflammatory mediators may lead to tight junction disruption and intestinal barrier dysfunction through myosin light chain kinase - mediated phosphorylation of myosin light chain and subsequent changes in the expression and localization of tight junction proteins .

Increased density of CD4 + T - cells and CD3 + or CD8 + intraepithelial T - cells have been reported along the intestinal mucosa of IBS patients . 6 , 9 , 10 , 60 T cell - derived pro - inflammatory interleukins ( ILs ) and cyto - kines have been implicated in the disruption of intestinal epi - thelial barrier . TNF - a and interferon gamma ( IFN g ) have been shown to be key effector molecules in the dysregulation of both the transcellular and the paracellular pathways through several mechanisms including impairment of Na + absorption and Na + - glucose co - transport and TJ disruption . 61 Both mediators have been shown to increase the expression and activity of MLCK leading to increased MLC phosphorylation and cytoskeleton contraction . 62 Moreover , IFN g has been also implicated in the redistribution of transmembrane TJ proteins occludin , claudin 1 , and claudin 4 . 63 Notably , IL - 4 and IL - 13 have been shown to increase intestinal permeability by inducing apoptosis of epithe - lial cells and regulating claudin 2 expression . 64 , 65 2 ) Mast cells Mast cells are common residents of the intestine , which are part of the innate immune system and contribute to the modu - lation of a wide variety of GI pathophysiological processes . 66 Mast cells have been widely studied in IBS and shown to be increased in number 9 , 10 , 55 and activation 10 and directly related to the generation of visceral hypersensitivity and abdominal pain in IBS . 57 , 58 Moreover , proximity of mast cells to enteric nerves has been identified in the colonic mucosa of IBS patients . 55 This anatomical relationship provides a physical substrate for bidi - rectional communication between the central nervous system and the gut , by which stress , luminal bacteria and other regula - tory factors may influence GI function and inflammation . 65 In fact , mast cells respond to neuropeptides and neurotransmitters ( among other molecules ) and synthesize and secrete molecules that modulate neural responses as well ( CRF , substance P , sero - tonin , nerve growth factor , etc . ) . 65 Mast cells have been largely implicated in the modulation of paracellular permeability . Upon activation they release potent inflammatory mediators , including prostaglandins , leukotriens , platelet - activating factor , cytokines ( TNF - a , IL - 3 , IL - 4 , IL - 5 , IL - 6 , and the granulocyte and monocyte colony - stimulating factor ) and specific proteases ( tryptase , chymase , carboxypeptidase - A ) . 67 , 68 Among all these mediators , tryptase seems particularly relevant as it can activate protease - activated receptor 2 on epi - thelial cells , resulting in modulation of TJ proteins and increase in permeability through paracellular pathways in the intestinal epithelium . 57 , 66 Noteworthy , increased tryptase mucosal expres - sion 13 , 57 and release to the intestinal lumen 10 has been recently described in IBS patients . In the GI tract , mast cells play a major role in stress - induced regulation of epithelial , motor , and visceral responses . 65 In ad - dition to pro - inflammatory mediators , human mucosal mast cells produce and respond to key molecules mediating the stress response such as CRF and related peptides ( urocortin ) . 69 , 70 Ac - tivation of these receptors on the cell surface leads to mast cell degranulation and selective release of cytokines and other pro - inflammatory mediators resulting in altered intestinal barrier function . 68 Pharmacologic inhibition of mast cells and treatment with CRF antagonists have been shown to inhibit the effect of mast cell - mediated changes in colonic epithelial physiology in animal models . 47 , 71 3 ) Monocytes / Macrophages Monocytes and macrophages trigger an acute inflammatory response to infectious agents . Activated macrophages release pro - inflammatory cytokines including TNF - a , IL - 1 b , and IL - 6 which are involved in the recruitment of other inflammatory cells and in intestinal barrier dysfunction . 61 , 72 , 73 The number of resident macrophages in the intestinal mucosa of IBS patients has been assessed with discrepant results . One study has re - ported unchanged infiltration of macrophages in the colonic mucosa of IBS as compared to healthy individuals , 74 while other showed reduced number in the mucosa of the rectum of patients that developed IBS after a bout of gastroenteritis compared to asymptomatic controls . 6 This reduction in the macrophage pop - ulation in IBS patients is further supported by decreased expres - sion of the macrophage - recruiting chemokines CC - chemokine ligand 2 and CXCL10 . 6 4 ) Eosinophils Eosinophils are multifunctional leukocytes implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous inflammatory processes , including infection , asthma and GI disorders . Eosinophils are also resident cells throughout the GI tract ( excluding the squamous mucosa of the esophagus ) and can synthesize and store potent immu - nologic mediators . Among these mediators , major basic protein has been described to induce epithelial barrier dysfunction as - sociated with the down - regulation of occluding . 75 It has recently been identify increased number of eosinophils along with mu - cosal hyperplasia and lymphocyte aggregation in the lamina propria of the colon in IBS patients ; 76 however , this finding has not yet been linked to the pathophysiology of IBS . Interestingly , eosinophilic cationic protein and eotaxin - 1 have been shown to be released in the intestinal lumen of IBS patients after CRF in - jection , 77 uncovering a putative role of stress - mediated eosino - phil activation in IBS physiopathology . 312 Gut and Liver , Vol . 6 , No . 3 , July 2012 3 . Molecular mechanisms of intestinal barrier function in IBS Although clinical studies have shown that increased intestinal permeability occur along the whole intestine , studies aimed at unraveling the molecular basis of this phenomenon in IBS are mainly focused on the large bowel . In this sense , application of high throughput technologies such as microarray gene profiling of mucosal samples from IBS patients are providing meaning - ful insights on the complex network of molecular interactions regulating the intestinal barrier function and its relation to IBS clinical manifestations . Indeed , colonic transcriptomic signatures of IBS patients have reported significant changes in the expres - sion of a wide variety of genes involved in the impairment of mucosal immune response to microbial pathogens . 78 Moreover , increased expression of genes involved in production of mucins ( MUC20 ) have been found in the colon of IBS suggesting altered mucus composition ; 76 however , the potential implication of this finding in IBS pathophysiology remains unclear . Recently , dif - ferential gene expression patterns of jejunal biopsies from IBS - D patients have been linked to pathways involved in mast cell activation , intestinal permeability and TJ signaling . 13 Barrier dysfunction in IBS has been linked to the down - regulation of the TJ scaffolding protein ZO - 1 11 and proteasome - mediated occludin degradation in the colonic mucosa of IBS patients . 12 Down - regulation and redistribution of ZO - 1 linked to mast cell activation and disturbed bowel habits has been also described in the jejunal epithelium of IBS - D patients . 13 Interest - ingly , the same effect on ZO - 1 localization together with en - hanced phosphorylation of MLC resulting in increased intestinal permeability has been found in mouse colonocytes added with fecal supernatants from IBS - D . 79 Given that tryptase , the most abundant serine proteases in the mast cells , alters ZO - 1 distribu - tion , associated with increased paracellular permeability in colo - nocytes , 66 it can be speculated that the clinical manifestations of IBS - D may rely on mast cell - related impairment of jejunal TJ function . Besides protein down - regulation , structural and functional modulation of barrier function can be also achieved by endocy - tosis of TJ proteins by a mechanism that depends on the stimu - lus involved . 34 Pro - inflammatory factors such as TNF and bac - terial products have been shown to induce the internalization of ZO - 1 and occludin by caveolar - mediated endocytosis 38 together with a concomitant loss of barrier function . Notably , caveolar - mediated endocytosis has been identified as the most significant signaling pathway associated with the transcriptional signature of IBS - D in the jejunum . 13 Taken together , these results sug - gest that ZO - 1 down - regulation and redistribution may help to explain the increased intestinal permeability observed in IBS - D , although further studies are needed to define the mechanisms and functional consequences of this alteration . The major focus of attention in above efforts has been the characterization of expression of protein - coding genes and their use for determining clinical outcomes . However , the ma - jority of the human genome consists of non - protein - coding RNA ( ncRNA ) . 80 Increasing evidence points to an important functional or regulatory role of ncRNA in cellular processes as well as a contribution of aberrant ncRNA expression to disease phenotypes . 81 These ncRNAs appear to function by the targeting of different epigenetic regulatory complexes to their intended targets . 82 Among the different species of ncRNAs , microRNAs ( miRNAs ) have been identified as playing a fundamental role in differentiation , survival and function of immune cells , cytokine responses as well as intracellular signaling pathways . 83 , 84 It has recently been shown shown that IBS - D patients harbour a dis - tinctive miRNA profiling , 85 which reflects an elevated transcrip - tion regulation activity that may account for some of the patho - logical hallmarks observed in this disorder , i . e . , distorted barrier function , low - grade inflammation and immune activation . Small bowel and colon tissues of IBS - D patients with increased intestinal permeability showed a consistent molecular profile defined by up - regulation of miR - 29a and down - regulation of glutamine synthetase expression , when compared to healthy and IBS - D with normal permeability . Noteworthy , the expres - sion of miR - 29a has been found increased in the colon of ulcer - ative colitis patients , a disorder also associated with increased barrier permeability , though , on the contrary , its expression was nonsignificantly altered in a small control population of IBS patients . 86 It should be equally noted that miR - 29a has over 1 , 100 estimated targets , whose contribution to the effect of miR - 29a on intestinal permeability cannot be excluded . One of such pu - tative targets is the TJ core protein claudin - 1 . Intriguingly , the intestine of IBS - D patients show decreased claudin - 1 and clau - din - 4 protein levels in both the mucosa of the small bowel and the colon , whereas elevated claudin - 1 and claudin - 3 levels are found in constipated IBS patients . 87 These facts support a role for miR - 29a in controlling gut inflammation and permeability , but also bring into question its specific utility as a diagnostic marker or therapeutic target for just only IBS - D patients with increased permeability . CONCLUSIONS Recent studies conducted in IBS patients provide strong evidence for the presence of low - grade inflammation together with altered intestinal permeability ; however , whether one phe - nomena precedes the other remains to be established . Stress or bacterial - mediated disruption of epithelial barrier function in IBS may result in adaptive neuro - immunological responses that , together with the malfunctioning of inflammation tuning - down mechanisms may lead to longstanding increase of gut perme - ability and hypersensitivity . The TJ is a critical determinant of mucosal barrier function . In the absence of mucin deficiency or gross epithelial damage , the TJ is the primary determinant Martínez C , et al : Intestinal Barrier Dysfunction in the Irritable Bowel Syndrome 313 of paracellular permeability . Defining how TJ - associated mol - ecules are regulated and how they signal to modulate changes in epithelial cells in IBS would be essential to understand their contribution to the pathogenesis of this disorder .
