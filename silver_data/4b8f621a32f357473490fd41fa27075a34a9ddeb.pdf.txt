First , I would like to thank my advisors Philip R . LeDuc , Lance A . Davidson , William C . Messner for guidance , support , motivation , enthusiasm , ideas , and for the opportunity to work in an exciting multi - disciplinary lab on a variety of interesting projects . Their positive attidutes , approach to problem solving , and focus on the “big picture” have all been inspirations throughout my time at Carnegie Mellon University . I could not have imagined having better advisors and mentors for my Ph . D study . They have all set examples of excellence as researchers , mentors , instructors , and role models for me . I am not sure if many graduate students are given the opportunity to develop their own individuality and self - suﬃciency by being allowed to work with such independence but they encourage me to grow as an independent thinker . I never wanted to miss my individual meetings with Phil since that where I obtained my inspiration and encouragement for the week . I would not have made it without his extensive knowledge , his laugh , positive energy and support . Lance is one and only person I know who knows everything , and I mean everything . Lance taught me how to be a scientist , how to think like a scientist and how to ask questions like a scientist . He was always there to teach me anytime and wasn’t afraid to get his hands dirty in the process . And I want to thank Bill for not abandoning me after his move to Tufts . My PhD would not have been the same without his brilliant ideas and his support . I also want to thank my committee member Shawn Litster for being a part of my com - mittee , for his valuable comments and suggestions .

Although the role of cell mechanics in tissue self - assembly has been demonstrated , little is known about the mechanical responses of 3D multi - layer tissues to chemical cues . To investigate the collective movements within multilayered tissues , I developed a novel microﬂuidic technique capable of removing desired height or width of tissue from a composite tissue . I call this technique " 3D tissue - etching " because it is analogous to techniques used in the microelectromechanics ( MEMS ) ﬁeld where complex 3D structures are built by successively removing material from a monolithic solid through subtractive manufacturing . I used a custom - designed microﬂuidic control system to deliver a range of tissue etching reagents ( detergents , chelators , proteases , etc . ) to speciﬁc regions of multilayered tissues microsurgically isolated from embryos of the African Claw - toed frog , Xenopus laevis . Xenopus embryos and explanted tissues have long been used to elucidate signaling and other cellular processes during development and here provide an ideal model 3D tissue etching . Long exposure to a narrow etchant stream cuts completely through cell - cell layers to expose the substrate . By reducing the exposure time a single layer may be removed . By controlling the width of the etchant and the exposure time a broader swath of the surface layer may be removed . For more reﬁned etching , after removal of a broad swath the resistance circuits can be switched and a second narrow stream can remove only a single narrow band within the swath exposed cells . I developed tissue - etching techniques that allow me to shape complex multi - layered embryonic tissues . The ability to control 3D stimulation and the form of multicellular tissues will provide extend the tools of tissue en - gineering to synthesize highly complex 3D integrated multicellular biosystems . Integration of tissue etching in my custom microﬂuidic system provides a " test - bed " where a range of hypotheses concerning the control and regulation of development and cell diﬀerentiation can be implemented and tested . ii Contents Acknowledgements v 1 Introduction 1 2 Methodology 11 2 . 1 Microﬂudics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11 2 . 1 . 1 Fabricating Microﬂuidic Mold and Channel . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13 2 . 1 . 2 Driving Flow in Microﬂluidic Channel . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16 2 . 1 . 3 Laminar Flow : Moving Interface . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19 2 . 1 . 4 Diﬀusion Across the Moving Interface . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22 2 . 1 . 5 Controlling Interface with Resistances . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24 2 . 1 . 6 Flow Characteristic Around a 3D Explant . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 28 2 . 2 Handling Xenopus leaves Embryos and Explant Preparation . . . . . . . . . 29 2 . 3 Positioning living Animal Cap Explants into microﬂuidic channels . . . . . . 29 2 . 4 Microscopy and image analysis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30 3 Probing a Complex Multi - Layer Embryonic Tissue Through Novel 3D Bio - ethching 31 i 3 . 1 Microﬂuidics in Cell Biology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32 3 . 2 Advantages of 3D Tissue Systems Versus 2D Cell Culture Systems . . . . . . 33 3 . 3 Result / Conclusion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 34 3 . 3 . 1 Experimental Technique to etch a composite tissue through 3D Bio - etching . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 34 3 . 4 Width and depth of the tissue etching regulated by microﬂuidic positioning and duration of detergent stream . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37 3 . 5 Multi - step etching can create novel 3D tissues . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38 3 . 6 Alternative etchants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40 3 . 7 Conclusion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 43 4 Studying Collective Cell Migration of Multi - layer Embryonic Tissue Using 3D Bio - etching 46 4 . 1 Collective Cell Migration . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 46 4 . 2 Studying Collective Cell Migration Using Microﬂudics . . . . . . . . . . . . . 52 4 . 3 Collective Multi - layer Response to " Subtractive Manufacturing " of Single Layer Bio - etching . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 53 4 . 4 Collective Multilayer Response to " Subtractive Manufacturing " . . . . . . . 55 5 Conclusion 72 5 . 1 Conclusion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 72 5 . 2 Future work . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 74 5 . 2 . 1 Creating Embryonic Bridges Using 3D Microﬂudics . . . . . . . . . . 74 5 . 2 . 2 Layered fabrication . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 78 5 . 2 . 3 Direct 3D printing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 78 ii 5 . 2 . 4 3D molding . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 79 5 . 2 . 5 Studying Tissue Integrity During Collective Migration Using 3D Mi - croﬂuidics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 84 iii List of Figures 1 . 1 Xenopus laevis life cycle [ 1 ] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 2 . 1 Microﬂuidic system assembled from 3D printed modular components .

During the development process , this single - celled fertilized egg continuously divides and diﬀerentiates into diﬀerent types of cells in an organized and precise manner [ 17 ] . For example , during development , chemical patterning of cell identity and guided cell movements are essential for vertebrate development . These features are critical to forming and elongating the prospective dorsal axial tissues including muscle and the central nervous system [ 18 ] . Without this integrated response , vertebrates cannot develop . Speciﬁc external signals such as chemical and mechanical stimulation guide movement of cells to speciﬁc locations and direct their diﬀerentiation . For instance , cells can migrate toward a source of a chemical using " chemotaxis " . Chemotaxis guides cells of the blood and lymphoid system during late morphogenetic processes that shape the cardiovascular system [ 19 , 20 ] , thus the lack of this coordinated biological control would cause the vertebrate to lack a functioning heart . To understand these complex processes researchers employ early stages of developing embryos of several model organisms such as Xenopus laevis [ 21 ] , Drosophila melanogaster [ 22 ] , Danio rerio [ 23 ] . These model organisms allow one to learn about role of chemical and mechanical processes in development without having to experiment on human embryos . Embryonic development involves complex series of cell signaling , cell migration and cell 1 diﬀerentiation processes that are coordinated spatiotemporally throughout morphogenesis . The word morphogenesis itself is Greek and the literal translation is " beginning of the shape " . Morphogenesis is one of the fundamental processes in the embryo that gives the ﬁnal shape of an organism . This process involves speciﬁcation of cells , tissues , and organs , control col - lective or individual cell migration and organization of spatial distribution of various cell types to form the structure of various part of the body . [ 19 ] . Hence , processes that guide embryonic development are crucial to an organism’s fate . Starting from fertilization until the whole organism is shaped , every morphogen and response needs to take place very pre - cisely in order for the organism to eventually reach programmed shape . The fate of a tissue and its ultimate physiological function relies on integrating genetic programs and processing external cues to provide positional information to guide cell migration and induce cell diﬀer - entiation [ 24 ] . Coordination of this complex mechanism is achieved through spatiotemporal cues in the microenvironment such as localized presentation of growth factors and gradients of substrate stiﬀness [ 25 ] . Starting at the very early stage of the embryo , cells and tissues receive spatiotemporal stimulation from chemical growth factors and respond to these factors by triggering changes in gene expression as well as changes in the cytoskeleton depending on morphogen concentration in the microenvironment [ 26 ] . These responses result in ob - servable phenotypes such as the production of cell protrusions , altered cell shape or changes to motility . Over the decades , many molecule pathways have been identiﬁed that initiate , maintain and guide moving cells during embryonic development but now the question is the underlying mechanisms by which cell monolayers respond to growth factors , sense directional signals , induce motility , and coordinate individual cell movements in such a precise , timely manner [ 27 ] . Coordinated collective migration is central to embryonic morphogenesis , wound repair , cancer invasion and homeostasis . In such migration , individual cells do not move on their own , instead they are physically and molecularly connected and and move as clusters or sheets . They remodel their ECM and migration tracks guided by chemical and physical 2 signals [ ? ] . Cells preserve cell - cell cohesion while tissues rearrange . They can carry immobile cells via mobile ones . Also , cells coordinate cytoskeletal dynamics to function as a single unit and jointly generate force . This collectiveness inﬂuences every cell to ensure the eﬀective movement and robust decisions [ 28 ] . Although studies describe cell adhesion , cell structure and cellular mechanisms , how they aﬀect cellular architecture during collective migration remains unknown . There are several models to study collective cell migration in vitro . The most common way to study collective cell migration is 2D scratch wound assays [ 29 ] . Experimental models of these movements have focused on the collective behaviors of coherent epithelial monolay - ers of cultured cells such as Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells [ 30 , 31 ] . Although traditional 2D cell cultures on ﬂat surfaces are not very representative of the native 3D en - vironments that cells experience , these models allows us to deﬁne major principles of single layer epithelial sheet migration that are revealed in parameters such as speed of wound clo - sure , cohesiveness of the cell - cell junctions and individual or collective cell polarization , and migration can be assessed . By contrast , embryonic development and tissue - self - assembly require the integration of cell movements within multiple cell layers composed of diﬀerent cell types . Considering the important role cell mechanics plays in tissue self - assembly it is surprising that little is known about the mechanical response of the multi - layer tissues to chemical cues . One of the reasons for this knowledge gap is the lack of the technologies allowing us to both stimulate and analyze the individual responses of cells within multi cell layer tissues . New tools are needed to investigate collective movements of multi - layered tissues . The lack of techniques to provide inputs and measure biological responses with suﬃcient temporal and spatial resolution has hampered the advancement of quantitative approaches to understanding development and tissue engineering . The objective of this thesis is to propose development of new 3D tools that will allows us to study cellular and molecular mechanisms of collective cell movements in multilayer tissues . 3 Studies have shown that cells cultured in 2D or 3D in vitro environments have diﬀerences in terms of their cell shape , cell - matrix adhesions and migratory behavior and much more compared to in vivo environments . In vivo studies using vertebrate or invertebrate organisms engage in vitro information on migration mechanism to embryonic development [ ? ] . Embryonic tissues isolated from developing embryos provide an excellent model system to study coordinated collective migration in a controlled environment . The embryo of Xeno - pus laevis is particularly well suited for these studies because it can be integrated with microscopic methods as well as gene and protein expression analysis for long term stud - ies of organism development . African Claw - toed frog , Xenopus laevis , embryos have been used as a model system since the 1930s because of its advantages over other model organ - isms [ 32 ] . Therefore , its development is very well characterized ( Figure 1 . 1 ) . Xenopus laevis has relatively large eggs , 1 - 1 . 4 mm in diameter , which is advantageous for classical mi - crosurgical manipulations , modern molecular - genetic techniques , and imaging . This makes Xenopus laevis easier to work with than other vertebrate embryos . A single female frog can lay hundreds of eggs at a time with hormone - stimulated mating . Embryos develop exter - nal to the mother and can be regulated with temperature allowing researchers control over their environment . Furthermore , every embryo has their own yolk part which helps them to survive in simple salt solutions for several days . The ability to perform microsurgery to cut explants from Xenopus embryos makes this organism ideal for local stimulations . Another advantage of using Xenopus is that development is rapid compared to mammalian devel - opmental models such as that of a mouse or rat . For instance , pre - cardiac Xenopus cells migrate to the correct position about a day after fertilization and a beating heart forms in the third day [ ? ] . Also , frogs are vertebrates like humans and use many of the same genes during development [ 33 ] . These are a few reasons why Xenopus is a popular model system and these features of Xenopus embryos make them highly suitable for microﬂuidic studies . Embryonic tissues develop using set of highly regulated signaling systems that organizes all the information from internal and external cues such as chemical gradients , growth factors , 4 Figure 1 . 1 : Xenopus laevis life cycle [ 1 ] . morphogens etc . Since external and internal chemical signals drive cells to speciﬁc locations , and manage cell diﬀerentiation into speciﬁc tissues , these chemicals play a fundamental role in the process of shaping the ﬁnalized animal or human [ 34 ] . It is assumed that congenital birth defects occur due to dysregulation of these chemical gradients or failure of the morphogenetic programs they are thought to regulate in early stages of embryonic development . Congenital birth defects such as neural tube and chronic heart defects are present in nearly one in 130 live births such defects and are principle causes of infant mortality in the ﬁrst year of life [ 35 , 36 ] . Such defects cause immense personal suﬀering , and have a high cost to society [ 37 ] . A major aim of modern developmental biology is to understand the root causes of these defects and provide tools for genetic counseling . Systematic eﬀorts are underway to identify mutations in mice that parallel human congenital birth defects [ 38 ] . While progress has been made toward understanding the role of cell mechanics in tissue self - assembly and the patterns that transduce chemical signals to cellular responses , little is known about the mechanical responses to chemical cues of the multi - layer tissues in coordi - nated cell rearrangements . However , being able to both discover the principles that guide self - assembly during embryonic development and apply those principles to direct or engineer 5 tissue by providing cues that guide cell fate decisions might lead to high - impact application in bioengineering and medical science especially within the ﬁelds of synthetic morphogenesis and organ regeneration . Characterizing the mechanical role of the cytoskeleton in control - ling tissue mechanics and morphogenesis will provide valuable insights into biomechanical lesions that may be responsible for congenital birth defects and aid the identiﬁcation of new factors that contribute to birth defects . Because of this potential , a variety of approaches have been made to simplify the complex , overlapping chemical stimuli functions operating within developing multicellular tissues to better understand the mechanisms driving cellular movements within multicellular sheets . To understand underlying mechanism of coordinated cell arrangements in response to chemical gradients , we need to control chemical microen - vironment of a multicellular tissue . Although controlling these gradients may be the key to understanding and preventing birth defects , such control is diﬃcult within multilayer tissue microenvironment of the embryo . The eﬀects of chemical control at an early stage signiﬁcantly inﬂuences development of organs and other physiologically important tissues at later stages . Many diﬀerent strategies have been used to deliver chemicals to cells in order to study the eﬀects of chemical en - vironment on embryonic development [ 39 ] . Externally provided soluble growth factors can manipulate cell diﬀerentiation programs during development . Methods of delivering these factors or modulating their activity include growth - factor - soaked heparin or agarose beads , gradient - leveling or saturating concentrations of growth factors , selective over - expression of genes encoding growth factors , activated receptors , or knock - out receptors in patches of cells [ 40 , 41 ] . However , a major drawback of these approaches for investigating dynamics is that chemical activity is poorly regulated . Since spatiotemporal control is pivotal in study - ing and understanding embryonic development , microﬂuidics has become a preferred method for controlling microenvironment for local stimulation studies [ ? ] . With microﬂuidic science , devices that are able to manipulate small volumes of ﬂuids can be designed and manufac - tured . Laminar ﬂow enables high throughput biological experiments from sub - cellular to 6 multi - cellular level with such precision and localization [ ? ] . Laminar ﬂow allows multiple diﬀerent ﬂuids to ﬂow without mixing ( except by diﬀusion ) , even though they are streamed parallel and adjacent to one another [ 42 ] . This sharp concentration gradient oﬀers diﬀerential treatments across the laminar ﬂow interface [ 43 ] . Contrary to traditional methods , chemical gradients can be delivered very precisely while being spatiotemporally controlled even in very early embryonic stages with microﬂuidics . Thus , a number of technologies exist for spatiotemporal stimulation of biological systems including patch clamping , micropipetting , and laser microsurgery [ 44 – 48 ] and are useful for examining local domains . However these approaches cannot provide high bandwidth spatiotemporal control over chemical environ - ments needed to work out the details of complex biochemical signaling pathways and the biophysical properties of multicellular tissues . In this study , I use microﬂuidics as a tool to locally and precisely control tissue environment as well as tissue architecture in order to study coordinated cell arrangements and migration . The overarching objective of this thesis is to highlight development of a new 3D mi - croﬂuidic methodology to enable studies of the principles of self - assembly during embryonic development and then to apply those principles to direct or engineer tissue assembly . This approach enables spatiotemporal regulation of chemical environments in and around tissue explants of Xenopus laevis embryos so I provide cues to guide cell fate decisions and in - vestigate the processes that guide collective movements of multiple cell layers in response to these cues . I investigated the individual responses of individual cell sheets ( epithelial and mesenchymal layer ) to mechanical cues in a multi cell layer tissue . Developing a novel 3D microﬂuidic technique capable of producing complex patterns of laminar multicellular structures allows us to study the multi - layer coordination of epithelial and mesenchymal cell layers as well as the acute mechanical and behavioral response of these layers to removal of neighboring or overlying tissues . The intellectual merit of this thesis is the focus on develop - ing a unique tool - kit for manipulating multicellular embryonic tissues , including embryoid bodies and progenitor cell aggregates , and direct their self - assembly into predictable struc - 7 tures . I aim to ﬁll the technological gap in studying multi - layer collective migration with " 3D tissue - etching " so one can analyze the dynamic collective responses of epithelial and mesenchymal cells in a single tissue with a microﬂuidic platform . I call this technique " 3D tissue - etching " in analogy with the techniques used in the MEMS ﬁeld . With this technique , I will have the opportunity to investigate the role of mesenchymal layer underneath the ep - ithelial layer while also studying epithelial layer dynamic responses and collective multi - layer rearrangement in response to reorganization of tissue architecture on top of mesenchymal layers . This thesis provides a unique advance in the ﬁeld microﬂuidics to probe the role of individual layers in 3D environments rather than 2D ﬂat experiments . 3D tissue etching oﬀers a unique way to study mechanical response and analyze collective cell sheet migration . Spatial and temporal control over the chemical microenvironment at an early stage sig - niﬁcantly inﬂuences development of organs and other physiologically important tissues at later stages . Fluidic devices have been implemented to manipulate cell attachment as well as deliver chemical reagents to speciﬁc cell populations [ 48 – 51 ] . Established microﬂuidic techniques are ideally suited to create and maintain stable chemical gradients in the en - vironment of cells . These approaches become much more complicated when scaling up to larger scale studies such as at the tissue level . The ability to stimulate single cells and tissues with microﬂuidics has been mainly conﬁned to 2D stimulation approaches , state - of - the - art is reviewed here [ 52 ] . Several standard approaches are currently used to study the eﬀects of chemical environment on embryonic development . To analyze the mechanochemical response of multilayer tissue , I developed a 3D microﬂuidic system to control the local chem - ical microenvironment for imposing mechanical stimulation . However , a major drawback of these conventional approaches for investigating dynamics is that chemical activity is poorly regulated . My goal is to understand integrated mechanochemical responses of complex 3D tissues through novel 3D microﬂuidic approaches . I tested the hypothesis that complex tis - sues , composed of multiple cell types including both epithelial and mesenchymal cells , are mechanically coupled and that by locally inhibiting the mechanics of speciﬁc layers I am 8 able to control the collective migration of the integrated tissue . I developed " subtractive manufacturing " tools in contrast to the " additive manufacturing " by manipulation of com - plex tissues composed of multiple cell types including both epithelial and mesenchymal cells . I developed new 3D microﬂuidics tools to manipulate streams in complex patterns in the main chamber , but also to independently manipulate streams beneath the tissue nearer to the mesenchymal cell adhesion complexes . This study uses laminar ﬂow through a three - dimensional channel formed by two microﬂuidic channel fabricated in layers that contact one another face - to - face at a 90 ◦ angle . I use 3D streams and complex 3D tissues to generate complex chemical and architectural microenvironments with the goal of controlling the tissue mechanics , cell motility , and wound healing . The ability to control 3D stimulation and the form of multicellular tissues will have high impact on tissue engineering and regeneration applications in bioengineering and medicine . It will also provide signiﬁcant improvements in the synthesis of highly complex 3D integrated multicellular biosystems . Furthermore , my custom microﬂuidic system can be conﬁgured to test a range of hypotheses concerning the control and regulation of development and cell diﬀerentiation with additional applications in tissue engineering . There are several ways to drive ﬂow with pressure in microﬂuidics without miniaturization : commercially available syringe pumps and gravity - driven ﬂow with diﬀerences in hydrostatic pressure . Conventional syringe pumps employing ﬂow control regulate limit long - term use due to a small volume of syringes . In addition , a ﬂow rate maintained by pressure diﬀerences using simple gravitational forces cannot be maintained for a long time since it changes as liquid volume decreases in the reservoirs . Pressure control is far better for controlling the ﬂow rate into a microﬂuidic network [ 53 ] , because the ﬂow rate is proportional to the inlet pressure and pressure at the inlet is easily measured for high bandwidth feedback control . Prior work from our group developed an approach that enabled ﬁne spatial precision and long term control of a ﬂow rate in microﬂuidics [ 54 ] . This approach is based on the rate of volumetric ﬂow of a ﬂuid through a rigid microﬂuidic channel of uniform cross - section 9 being proportional to the pressure drop across the channel , and inversely proportional to the ﬂuid resistance of the channel , itself dependent on the channel’s cross - sectional area and length [ 48 ] . Since the total ﬂow rate through the outlet channel is proportional to the sum of inlet pressures , changes in one pressure at one inlet require corresponding changes in forcing pressures at other inlets if a constant ﬂow rate is required . Constant ﬂow rate is desirable because the ﬂow rate determines shear stress experienced by cells or tissues on the channel surfaces . Shear stress is even more important with multilayer tissues as the layers adhere to each other less strongly than the bottom layer adheres to the microﬂuidic channel . In addition , I now know that control of the shape of the cross section proﬁle of the central stream requires control of the pressure at multiple inlets . In this thesis , chapter 2 introduces the methodologies that have been used in this thesis . It includes an in - depth understanding of microﬂuidics and its application to biological studies as well as the advantages of using laminar ﬂow velocity proﬁles and interface models as a tool to examine biological questions . Also , handling embryos and dissecting embryonic tissue from embryos are discussed . Chapter 3 is devoted to the 3D bioetching technique . Using three - inlet channel , I etched desired stripes of both layers to study their collective " healing " response to bio - etching . This system provides for us a 3D tissue environment to study each layers’ response to etching and their collective response result in reorganized collective migration . Chapter 4 includes collective cell migration studies using 3D bioetching technique . Finally , in chapter 5 , I conclude my thesis and touch on some possible future work of using 3D microﬂuidics to study embryonic bridges for a deeper understanding of tissue integrity in collective cell movements . 10 Chapter 2 Methodology 2 . 1 Microﬂudics Microﬂuidic science is the process of designing and manufacturing systems that manipulate ﬂuids with the use of channels at microliter and smaller volumes . Although laws of physics stay the same when scaling down , viscous forces dominate inertial forces within microﬂuidic channels so that the ﬂow is laminar . In this regime , two ﬂuids can ﬂow adjacent to one another without convective mixing [ 42 ] . If the channels are small enough , a planar interface that forms between two adjacent solutions becomes the location of a sharp concentration gradient . Advantages of laminar ﬂow are not only limited to the ability to use smaller volumes of chemicals and polydisperse chemical streams adjacent to each other without mixing except diﬀusion but also provides separations and point - of - care or in - the - ﬁeld detec - tion with high resolution and sensitivity at very low cost . Microﬂuidics have been used in many areas including chemical syntheses [ 55 , 56 ] , optoﬂuidics [ 57 , 58 ] , fuel cell [ 59 , 60 ] , cell patterning [ 61 ] , molecular interaction and diﬀusion analysis [ 62 ] , embryo transporting [ 63 ] , neutrophil chemotaxis through chemical gradient generation [ 64 ] , embryonic development under localized temperature gradients [ 65 ] , cell migration [ 12 ] . 11 The interest in microﬂuidics for cellular studies has evolved because of the practical use of laminar ﬂow interfaces . Laminar ﬂow formation provides the ability to both control the cellular environment and maintain sharp interfaces to have polydispersive ﬂow to address the specisﬁc cells or subcellular level locally . The co - ﬂowing streams can then be used to diﬀerentially treat two adjacent regions of space inside the channel . By simply manipu - lating the ﬂuids in micro - channels and using the advantage of laminar ﬂow , microﬂuidics enable high - throughput biological experiments that oﬀer new capabilities in controlling con - centrations of molecules in space and time [ 66 ] . Microﬂuidics enable the local control of tissue to the subcellular scale in a dynamic and automatic manner so we can best study cell behavior [ 67 ] . Combining microﬂuidic techniques with dynamic and automated control with complex microfabrication enables a more precise regulation of experiments to reveal the complex chemical and mechanical signalling pathways within the cell to unwind the control mechanism within the entire organism . Thus , this technique has been used to concurrently treat distinct regions of cells , clusters of cells or embryos with multiple ﬂuid environments that diﬀer in temperature or chemical composition [ 67 – 70 ] . Composition of chemical and mechanical parameters together form the microenvironment of a cell . Chemical parameters include all molecules in the media around the cell and the mechanical environment is composed of the response to the topology and stiﬀness of sub - strate as well as deformations exerted by the adjacent cells and the extracellular matrix [ 71 ] . Overall , chemical and mechanical signals are thought to be strongly coupled [ 72 ] . Long - term studies of localized responses of cells and tissues to chemical and mechanical stimuli are critical in studying developmental biology systems like Xenopus . But , one of the important limitations in the area of tissue generation is the lack of techniques to provide inputs and measure biological responses with suﬃcient temporal and spatial resolution . Microﬂuidic technology provides an opportunity to control stimulation in both time and space in living systems within aqueous environments . Traditional cell culture study methods can change and control such parameters for a population of cells but lack the ability to control chemical 12 or mechanical parameters locally over a long time period . For instance , when the chemical environment is changed , signaling pathways trigger changes in gene expression as well as changes in the cytoskeleton . Changes in the cytoskeleton should result in observable pheno - types such as the production of cell protrusions , changes to motility , or altered cell shape . These changes can be remarkably rapid , occurring within minutes or even seconds . Contrary to traditional approaches that apply chemical compounds which fail to change parameters dynamically , live spatiotemporal control stimulation with microfulidics should be combined . Recently , our group used a novel live spatiotemporal microﬂuidic control with embryonic tis - sues [ 73 ] . In this paper , it has been shown that , spatiotemporally regulated cell contractility eﬀects cell shape and eventually may result in changes in morphology and function of the organism . 2 . 1 . 1 Fabricating Microﬂuidic Mold and Channel Microﬂuidic channels are composed of multiple or singular microchannels that are brought together to perform a desired function . These channels can be fabricated through addi - tive ( molding ) or subtractive ( etching ) manufacturing into diﬀerent materials such as glass , silicon or polymers . Before the most common way to fabricate microﬂuidic channels was photolithography on silicon substrates . Photolithography is the process that uses the light to replicate a microﬂuidic channel design from a photomask to a light sensitive photore - sist on the substrate . The steps of fabricating a mold includes a design of the channels in a software program , printing this design onto a photomask , molding the design onto a silicon wafer using a photoresist with photolithography . First , desired microﬂuidic channel geometry is drawn in a software program ( AutoCAD , SolidWorks , Illustrator etc . ) and it is printed on a photomask by photomask manufacturer using UV opaque ink for plastic ﬁlms . Later , photoresist ( SU8 50 , 100 , 250 etc . ) is poured on a silicon wafer and spread . Using spin coating at a speciﬁc speed for a speciﬁc time ( changing with the channel height ) , height of the photoresist on the substrate is achieved the height of the designed channel . After spin 13 coating , soft baking for an hour is suggested . Photomask is placed on the photoresist coated silicon wafer and exposed to UV light and UV exposed areas are cured when using negative resist like SU8 . There is also positive photoresists that are removed wherever UV light is ex - posed . When using SU8 photoresist , photomask enables the desired design to be cured only since the rest is prevented by the opaque mask , in other words : wherever it is exposed , stay . After UV treatment , silicon wafer needs to be hard baked to harden the photoresist . Etching process follows baking and for negative photoresistant like SU8 using SU8 solvent non - cured part of the photoresist is etched away leaving the negative mold for desired design . Silicon wafer then needs to be cleaned with DI water before use ( Figure 2 . 2 ) . This process is highly eﬀective , precise and cost eﬀective but requires photoresistant , photomask , ﬂat substrate like silicon wafer , spin coating , UV light and a hood or clean room . Although these molds are reusable for mass production , after roughly 100 uses , photoresistant comes oﬀ . Disadvantages include the need of a ﬂat surface , fragility of silicon wafer , dimension limitation , inability to fabricate circular channels and limited amount of use . Although lithography provides the ability to fabricate precise , small channels it requires high tech tools and environments and harsh chemicals for etching steps . With the advancement of microludic technology towards 3D geometries , other fabrication methods have been started to be used for mold fabricating like 3D printing and micro - nano milling [ 2 , 74 ] to overcome the limitations of lithography methods . Micro and nano miling technology have been used for organs - on - chips with the need of using circular channels especially for vascular engineering . Micro and nano milling enabled the fabrication of circular cross - sectioned microchannels . On the other hand , with the increase use of 3D printers the need to pholithography has been decreasing . 3D printers are not as time - consuming and do not require photomask or tedious steps like photolithog - raphy by providing ﬂexible geometries ( Figure 2 . 1 ) . Instead of fabricating a monolithic 2D form , 3D printers even oﬀer lego - like modular microﬂuidic systems [ 2 ] . Most 3D printers cannot go tiny dimensions except Nanoscribe but they deﬁnitely oﬀer the ease of fabrication and unlimited amount of use . 14 Figure 2 . 1 : Microﬂuidic system assembled from 3D printed modular components . Single - outlet subcircuits were combined to parallelize operation of the tunable mixer to have ( A and B ) two , ( C and D ) three outlets . Each subcircuit is constructed identically and arranged around a single inlet splitter such that the mixing ratio at each outlet is independently controlled by corresponding choices of reference and select resistors . Adapted from [ 2 ] Microﬂuidics technology rapidly evolved over the last two decades with the invention of soft lithography [ 3 ] . Soft lithography altered the traditional way of fabricating microﬂuidic devices on silicon substrates and enabled the use of polymer molding which is a lot cheaper and does not require strong know - how or clean room . Current technology uses an elastomer , poly - di - methyl siloxane ( PDMS ; SYLGARD 184 , Dow Corning , MIDLAND , MI , USA ) to fabricate microﬂuidic channels . PDMS is in liquid form at room temperature and it solidiﬁes when it is mixed with its cross linking agent . In general a 1 : 10 ratio has been used for microﬂuidic channel fabrication . PDMS can be cured at room temperature or in the oven to shorten the time . After the PDMS hardens , the desired design of the micro channels is obtained . Using a needle appropriately sized to the future tubing , inlet and outlet holes are punched . The ﬁnal step of microﬂuidic channel fabrication is placing the previously cleaned glass and PDMS replica in plasma cleaner for a minute . The oxygen plasma cleaner helps glass and replica to have a covalent bond to seal the PDMS - glass bonded channels . PDMS has many advantages for cellular studies such as the ability to fabricate by following relatively easy steps , biocompatibility , permeabliability to gas and transparency which makes 15 Figure 2 . 2 : Soft Lithography Steps . Adapted from [ 3 ] it perfect for imaging cellular biological studies . In this thesis , modular ﬂuidic resistances ( R20 - 100x50 ) and ( R60 - 100x50 ) were produced from microﬂuidic channels 20 and 60 mm long each and had cross sections that were 100 µ m wide and 50 µ m high [ 75 ] . The microﬂuidic channel for the tissue had three inlet channels that were rectangular cross sections with dimensions 500 µ m wide , 300 µ m high , and 5 mm long . These inlet channels converged to form a single outlet channel ( rectangular cross section 1500 µ m wide , 300 µ m high , and 10 mm long ) . The reservoirs and pressure sensors were connected to the microﬂuidic device using polyethylene tubing ( Intramedic , inner diameter of 0 . 78 mm ) . 2 . 1 . 2 Driving Flow in Microﬂluidic Channel Over the time , various ﬂow controllers have been developed as ﬂow control is essential to any microﬂuidic application in order to accurately drive the ﬂuids inside microﬂuidic de - 16 vices . Surface tension [ 76 ] , acoustic wave [ 77 ] , electrokinetic ( electro osmotic pump ) [ 78 ] and pressure driven controllers ( syringe pump , pressure pump , peristaltic pump , etc ) [ 75 ] are the main methods that have been used to drive ﬂows in the microﬂuidic channels over few decades . The most common methods are pressure driven ﬂow and electrokinetic ﬂow but the latter method is not biocompatible and therefore not suitable for live biological experiments . As such , in this thesis , ﬂow is driven by regularized pressure . The governing equation of for incompressible , Newtonian ﬂuid motion in pressure - driven ﬂow is derived by Navier - Stokes equation : ρ ( ∂u ∂t + ( u ·∇ u ) = ∇ p + µ ∇ 2 u + ρg ( 2 . 1 ) where ρ is the density of the ﬂuid , u represents velocity , µ is the dynamic viscosity , p represents pressure , and g is gravitational acceleration . Navier - Stokes equation ( equation 2 . 1 ) can be simpliﬁed by making several assumptions like 1 ) incompressible ( the incompressibility constraint ( u ·∇ u = 0 ) and the boundary conditions ( u = 0 at the walls ) and Newtonian ﬂuid , 2 ) steady - state ﬂow ( i . e . no transient variation ) , 3 ) axial bulk ﬂow to downstream for a channel with a uniform cross - section with no advection across streamlines that is formed by the bulk ﬂow , and 4 ) gravitational eﬀects are negligible leaves the equation as the ﬂuid ﬂow is determined entirely by the pressure [ 79 ] : µ ∇ 2 u = ∇ P ( 2 . 2 ) Pressure - driven ﬂow proﬁles are based on macroscale Poiseuille ﬂow theory [ 80 ] . J . L . M . Poiseuille studied this ﬂow regime in the early 1800s , and it is well - studied characteristic ﬂow in microﬂuidics . Poiseuille ﬂow is characterized by a parabolic velocity proﬁle , where velocity varies parabolically across the channel because of the so - called no - slip boundary condition , with a maximum velocity in the center of the channel and zero on all stationary boundaries like at the wall of the microﬂuidic chip . Despite the parabolic proﬁles in simple geometries with pressure - driven ﬂows , for boundary forces induced ﬂows ( such as electro - osmotic - ﬂow , 17 Figure 2 . 3 : Hydrostatic dispersion eﬀects in diﬀerent ﬂow proﬁles .

Notice the broadening of the band due to the non - uniform ﬂow proﬁle . ( c ) The ﬂow proﬁle in Poiseuille ﬂow . [ 4 ] wall - shear - driven - ﬂow , etc . ) nearly uniform proﬁles can be expected [ 81 ] . Uniform velocity proﬁles provides minimized hydrostatic dispersion eﬀect . On the other hand the nonlinearity in Poiseuille ﬂow velocity proﬁle causes a hydrostatic dispersion eﬀect in the channel which might be undesirable for localized stimulations Figure2 . 3 . One way to use pressure - driven ﬂow is using positive displacement pumps like commer - cially available syringe pumps to regulate ﬂow through the inlets of channels . While this method enables to maintain ﬁxed ﬂow rates , one of the important drawbacks is syringe pump volume , which is relatively small . With this system , long - term studies cannot be conducted due to volume limitation . Another way is to utilize gravity force by using height diﬀerence between reservoirs . One of the important drawbacks of this method is to maintain the ﬂow rate as its changes as ﬂuid volume drops in the reservoir . Thus this system may not be as precise as desired . My experiments require the long - term , precise control of the laminar ﬂow interface in microﬂuidic channels in order to manipulate the cellular chemical environments and architecture . Long - term studies are necessary for investigating cell responses , which are often take several hours to days . However , existing commercialized systems have limitations 18 for long - term studies because they use syringe pumps with relatively small volumes . In this thesis , I use a novel control system that was designed by a former member of LeDuc lab [ 75 ] . This system controls the pressure at the inlets of microﬂuidic channels by modulating the resistance of the ﬂuidic network connecting the microchannels to supply reservoirs . This system controls and varies the position and the shape of the interface between the ﬂuids with high precision and high bandwidth for long time periods . With this approach large ﬂuid reservoirs may be used for long - term studies ( hours to days ) of cellular dynamics [ 82 ] . 2 . 1 . 3 Laminar Flow : Moving Interface Scaling down a system impacts the eﬀects of inertia forces eﬀect the most . At the micro - scale , surface area to volume ratio increases causing viscosity forces to take over the inertia resulting in laminar ﬂow . Viscosity of a ﬂow is the quantitative measurement of the ﬂuid’s ability to resist shear stresses . When viscosity is dominant in a ﬂow , ﬂuid moves in parallel layers ( laminar ﬂow ) whereas when inertia ( the tendency of the ﬂuid to retain its initial motion unless an outside force acts on it ) dominates ﬂow can eventually result in turbulent ﬂow . In contrast to the macro - scale , laminar ﬂow in micro scales can be achieved with simple designs if the Reynolds number ( Re ) , the ratio of viscous to inertial forces , is small . Re number is a dimensionless number that quantiﬁes the ﬂow characteristics for given ﬂow conditions . The Re number can be calculated as follows : Re = ρU 2 ( µU ) / L = ρUL µ ( 2 . 3 ) where Reynolds Number is non - dimensional , ρ is the density of the ﬂuid ( kg / m 3 ) , U is the velocity based on the actual cross - section area of the duct or pipe ( m / s ) , L is the characteristic length ( m ) , and µ is the dynamic viscosity ( Ns / m 2 ) . Reynols number is used to show if the ﬂow regime is laminar or turbulent . The Re number has three ranges to characterize the ﬂow . For low Reynolds numbers ( Re < 2300 ) , 19 Figure 2 . 4 : Fluid Flow Regimes as a Function of Reynolds Number [ 81 ] ﬂow behavior depends on ﬂow viscosity , and the ﬂow is mostly steady , smooth , viscous , or laminar . For high Reynolds numbers ( Re > 4000 ) , behavior of ﬂow is determined by the inertia more than the viscosity and the ﬂow is unsteady , churning , roiling , or turbulent . For intermediate Reynolds numbers ( 2300 < Re < 4000 ) the ﬂow is transitional - partly laminar and partly turbulent ( Figure 2 . 4 ) . However , in a straight channel , the value of Re = 10 3 is the limit for the transition from a laminar to turbulent ﬂow [ 81 ] . However , low Reynolds numbers do not guarantee steady and smooth ﬂow without any vortexes . At Re > 10 local microvortices and ﬂow separation occur due to the increase of inertial force which can cause complex ﬂow patterns . Due to the high viscosity , Reynolds numbers in microﬂuidic channels are usually roughly 1 , which is called Stokes ﬂow or Creep - ing ﬂow regime . In creeping ﬂow , inertia terms become so small that they are negligible in the momentum equation , which makes the system linear . The most famous example of creeping ﬂow that shows how smooth the ﬂow is compared to other laminar conditions is that of a viscous ﬂuid ﬂowing over a stationary solid sphere with the axisymmetry about the ﬂow direction ( Figure 2 . 5 ) . This property of ﬂow is especially critical for my experiments , 20 Figure 2 . 5 : Diﬀerent Low Reynolds Regimes ﬂowing over a stationary solid since the ﬂow in microﬂuidic channel ﬂows over Xenopus embryonic tissue which is multi layer thus not ﬂat . With the advantage of using creeping ﬂow by keeping Re number is smaller than 1 , ﬂow is not disturbed by a solid explant and still provides spatial regulation . Microﬂuidics oﬀer unique behavior such as creating and controlling the sharp interface and developing diﬀerent uses for it . When miscible ﬂuids interact , over the time they become a homogeneous solution . There will be no meniscus forming between two miscible ﬂuids like alcohol and water . However , under laminar ﬂow conditions , there will be a boundary between two ﬂowing miscible ﬂuids and mixing will only occur at a predictable rate by diﬀusion . This boundary is called as a dynamic or ’moving interface’ [ 5 ] and this unique behavior can be used for temporally and spatially control within microfuidic channels . On the other hand , laminar ﬂow provides another type of interface with two immiscible ﬂuids ( e . g . oil and water ) where one liquid is dispersed in another called ﬂoating interfaces ( Figure 21 Figure 2 . 6 : Microﬂuidic Interfaces with immiscible ( a ) and miscible ﬂuids ( b ) . [ 5 ] 2 . 6 ) . Floating interfaces usually are used to produce droplets for microscale containers ( i . e . capsules ) and acts as permeable walls between two ﬂuids , which is utilized for performing and analyzing reactions , creating custom magnetic or protein - coated vesicles , or transporting cargos [ 83 – 85 ] . Here in this thesis , I used the advantage of moving interfaces , where I moved two water - based solutions next to each other without mixing . 2 . 1 . 4 Diﬀusion Across the Moving Interface A planar interface that forms between two adjacent ﬂuids is the location of a sharp concen - tration gradient . Under laminar ﬂow conditions , mixing between adjacent streams occurs only at a predictable rate of diﬀusion . Diﬀusion though causes the gradient to broaden as the ﬂow advances down the channel . This diﬀusion can be controlled and width of the diﬀusion can be managed . As contact - time increases between miscible ﬂuids with low velocity , diﬀu - sion broadens and , if contact - time is long enough two miscible ﬂuids eventually mix despite laminar ﬂow condition . To ensure eﬃcient local stimulation , diﬀusion rate still should be controlled . To control the width of diﬀusion , another dimensionless number , Peclet number ( Pe ) , added to the equation . Peclet number is given by the ratio of convective ﬂuxes to 22 diﬀusive ﬂuxes and changes for every species and ﬂuids . At the conditions where Pe number is high enough , mixing is negligible because diﬀusion occurs slowly on ﬂow time scales . The Peclet number is deﬁned as : P e = U a L D ( 2 . 4 ) where U a is the average velocity of the ﬂow , L is a characteristic length of the system perpendicular to the direction of the ﬂow and D is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the particle or molecule of interest [ 5 ] . In microﬂuidics , usually Re«1 due to laminar creeping ﬂow , thus Pe number ends up being Pe»1 since average velocity and characteristic length are coming from Re equation and they are very small numbers . In laminar ﬂow , under the conditions of Pe»1 , mixing through diﬀusion is negligible [ 86 ] . In this case , diﬀusion does not broaden in the channel and change the interface . Interface stays sharp as contact time of these two miscible ﬂuids is short . Since this system is pressure - driven ﬂow and velocity proﬁle is parabolic , being the max velocity in the center and near zero velocity at the walls , diﬀusion at the interface changes in channel height and becomes more signiﬁcant at the walls [ 87 ] . The diﬀusive dispersion grows more quickly and diﬀusion becomes broader as ﬂow - rate becomes smaller at the same cross section [ 88 ] . Since my experiments are with live tissue , we needed to ﬁnd the optimum ﬂow rate to ﬂow over the tissue without aﬀecting its fate . The lowest possible ﬂow rate for the experiments employing sharp concentration gradients of chemicals was determined by using computational ﬂuid dynamics ( CFD ) simulations by former LeDuc lab member [ 82 ] . The simulation results showed that diﬀusive dispersion is more signiﬁcant near the wall and grows more quickly than the center of the channel where the ﬂuid velocity is relatively high . Diﬀusion thickness is determined based on a 10 % threshold of mass fraction , which is normalized by the concentration across the interface . The simulation results showed that diﬀusion exponentially grows under a ﬂow rate of 10 µ l / min in a microﬂuidic channel [ 89 ] . 23 Figure 2 . 7 : Diﬀusive dispersion across a laminar ﬂow interface . a ) Diﬀusive dispersion through the channel at a ﬂow rate of 30 µ l / min . b ) Diﬀusion proﬁle in the cross section to the downstream ﬂow at ﬂow rates of 10 , 30 , and 50 µ l / min . [ 6 ] 2 . 1 . 5 Controlling Interface with Resistances For a 2D multi - inlet and one outlet microﬂuidic device at a low Reynolds number , a position of the laminar ﬂow interface between multi - inlet streams can be mathematically determined by the pressures at the channel inlets and the dimensions of the channel that determines ﬂuidic resistances . As we can eﬀectively ignore the inertial terms nonlinear partial diﬀerential equation ( Navier - Stokes equation ) into a simple linear one where the ﬂuid ﬂow is determined entirely by the pressure . Since there is no leakage through the channel assumed , the ﬂow rate in the outlet channel should be equal to the sum of the inlet ﬂow - rates due to mass conservation . Disregarding the diﬀerences of density and viscosity among the ﬂuids at the inlets , it is true that the interfaces are planar and stable through the main channel and there is no mixing across the interfaces between the streams except by diﬀusive dispersion . With the assumption that there is no pressure diﬀerence in all the cross sections of the 24 Figure 2 . 8 : Schematic of pressure - driven ﬂow in a network of parallel channels in the relation to electrical circuits [ 7 ] microﬂuidic channel , regulation of the pressure at the channel inlets allows control of the interface positions and adjacent ﬂuid volume will be determined by the relative inlet ﬂow rate proportionally between each stream . In the case of square channels or low aspect ratio rectangular channels , a approximation of the relation between pressure and ﬂow rate ( Q ) is given by : ∇ P = 12 µLQ wh 3 / [ 1 − 0 . 63tanh ( h w ) ] ( 2 . 5 ) where w is the widest and h is the smallest dimension . Due to continuity through ﬂuid networks along the channel length , the ﬂow rate must remain constant . ∇ P = Q . R ( 2 . 6 ) where R is a ﬂuidic resistance along the length of the channel . ( Figure 2 . 8 ) Since the total ﬂow rate through the outlet channel is proportional to the sum of inlet pressures , changes in one pressure at one inlet require corresponding changes in forcing pressures at other inlets if a constant ﬂow - rate is required . Constant ﬂow - rate is desirable because the ﬂow rate determines shear stress experienced by cells or tissues on the channel surfaces . Shear stress is even more important with multilayer tissues as the layers adhere to each other less strongly than the bottom layer adheres to the microﬂuidic channel . 25 In a microﬂuidic device whose inlet channels have equal ﬂuid resistance , the volumetric ﬂow - rate through the outlet channel is proportional to the sum of the pressures at the inlets [ 90 ] . Under laminar ﬂow conditions , the two ﬂuids will enter the outlet channel side - by - side in volumetric proportion according to their relative ﬂow - rates . These ﬂow - rates depend only on the pressure drop across the inlet channels . Consequently , the position of the interface between the streams can be controlled by modulating ﬂuid pressure at the inlets when the interfaces are planar [ 91 , 92 ] . The width fraction has been believed to be linearly correlated with the pressure fraction so the interface position between three streams in the 3 - inlet microﬂuidic channel can be readily determined by the pressure fraction [ 92 ] . Here , in this research , I use ﬂuidic channels with diﬀerent dimension as rresistances to change the inlet pressure individually . By using resistances , the pressure that is the same at the three reservoirs can be manipulated , thereby allowing ﬂow rates to be altered individually in every inlet [ 93 ] . Figure 2 . 9 : Modular ﬂuidic resistances . The relation between pressure - drop along the channel downstream and the ﬂow - rate Q is analogous to Ohm’s Law for electrical circuits with ﬂuid pressure - drop for electrical potential diﬀerence ( i . e . voltage , V ) and ﬂuid ﬂow for electric current , i . V = i . R ( 2 . 7 ) 26 Figure 2 . 10 : Interface control with resistances in 3 - inlet microﬂuidic channel . The width of each inlet ﬂuid in the main channel changes due to their ﬂow rate . a ) Resistance - 10 is at the two side inlets shown in pink , Resistance - 30 is on the center inlet shown in green . b ) Resistance - 10 is at the two side inlets shown in pink , Resistance - 60 is on the center inlet shown in green . Modular resistances are also microﬂudic channels 200 µ m wide and 50 µ m high . To modulate inlet pressures , three resistances and three chamber sizes ( R10 - 200x50 , R20 - 200x50 , R60 - 200x50 ) ( have been designed as modular microﬂuidic devices in this study ( Figure 2 . 9 ) . Smallest modular resistance ( R10 - 200x50 ) is 10 mm long , and the rectangular cross - section is 200 µ m wide and 50 µ m high . In ﬁgure 2 . 10 , three parallel streams in volu - metric proportion to diﬀerent resistances have been depicted in a three - inlet channel . This ﬁgure represents the notion the more the resistances , the narrower the width of the central stream in the main channel . This opportunity allows us to change the interface in the main channel spatiotemporally without any complicated set - up thus allowing us to test diﬀerent controlled conditions . 27 Figure 2 . 11 : CFD simulation of ﬂow properties around the explant . a ) Relative eﬀects for ﬂow - rates , pressures , and Reynolds number . The red dashed box represents a useable range of the pressure in the experiment to prevent high diﬀusion and high shear stress based on the simulations . b ) Flow velocity c ) Shear rate around the explant at 30 µ l / min ﬂow - rate [ ? ] . 2 . 1 . 6 Flow Characteristic Around a 3D Explant One important issue to consider when delivering chemical factors to multicellular tissues using microﬂuidics is the eﬀect of the shape of a three - dimensional ( 3D ) tissue on ﬂow pat - terns around the tissue , which is critical for a precise stimulation performance of the system . Several factors such as the size and shape of the tissue , the size of the channel , and ﬂow conditions can change the localized pattern of stimulation since larger microscale channels may have higher sensitivity to the chemical patterns even at relatively lower Reynolds num - ber [ 94 ] . Former lab member run computational ﬂuid dynamics ( CFD ) simulations to explore the eﬀect of these factors on the ﬂow conditions , all CFD work in this section is belong to YongTae Kim [ 82 ] . Optimum numbers were obtained by considering the diﬀusion broaden - ing issue at low ﬂow - rates and the high shear stress on the explant at high ﬂow - rates . CFD results showed that ﬂow conditions are not disrupted around the explant for some range of Reynolds numbers , ﬂow rates , and the optimum shear stress range that explants can handle without detaching is also obtained . The determination of the diﬀusion thickness was based 28 on a 10 % threshold of mass fraction , and diﬀusion thickness at the end of the channel kept at 20 µ on the bottom plane . When Re number is kept under 1 , optimum ﬂow rate range is between 10 µ l / min and 50 µ l / min ( Figure2 . 11 a ) . From these CFD result , I selected a ﬂow rate of 30 µ l / min for experiments which corresponded to a inlet pressure of 2 kPa . This ﬂow - rate is equal to a ﬂuid velocity around the explant of less than 1 . 0 mm / s and a shear rate of less than 30 s − 1 ( Figure2 . 11 b and c ) ; this is small relative to the reported biological shear rate for other embryos [ 65 ] . The shear stress was 0 . 04 Pa ( 0 . 4 dynes / cm 2 ) , which is approximately 2 . 7 % of the shear stress that leads to physiological responses approximately 1 . 5 Pa ( 15 dynes / cm 2 ) [ 89 ] . 2 . 2 Handling Xenopus leaves Embryos and Explant Prepa - ration Eggs were collected from hormonally stimulated female Xenopus laevis frogs . Eggs were fertilized in vitro [ 95 ] , dejellied in 2 % Cysteine solution ( pH 8 ) [ 96 ] and cultured in 1 / 3 X Modiﬁed Barth’s Solution ( MBS ) until stage 10 [ 97 ] . At stage 10 embryos were transferred into Danilchik’s For Amy solution ( DFA ) and forceps were used to remove viteline mem - branes . I used hair - loops and hair - knives to micro surgically isolate Animal cap explants . Microﬂuidic channels were coated with ﬁbronection at 4 ◦ C overnight . Micro surgically iso - lated explants were positioned in the channels using negative pressure . 2 . 3 Positioning living Animal Cap Explants into microﬂu - idic channels Animal cap tissue needs to be positioned in the center of the microﬂuidic channel for our experiments . After coating the substrate of the microﬂuidic network with ﬁbronectin , I 29 position 100 µ m thick micro surgically isolated tissue explants in the microﬂuidic chamber . I close all the inlets with microscale tubes and valves , and open one inlet and one outlet in the large main chamber . Using negative pressure in the inlet connected to a syringe , the tissue explant that is located on the top nearby the outlet of the microﬂuidic device is positioned inside the chamber . Carefully adjusting the syringe , I position the tissue into the desired location ( center of the outlet channel ) in the chamber . After positioning , I close the inlet and outlet with valves in order to close the entire network closed so that there is no pressure diﬀerential around the tissue . This enables the tissue stably attached to the substrate without any disruption . Otherwise , the tissue will not be ﬁrmly attached to the substrate or might need more time for the attachment and spreading . I allow the explant to adhere the glass substrate for 4 hours prior to ﬂow studies . 2 . 4 Microscopy and image analysis To capture images of animal cap bio - etching in microﬂuidic channels , a digital charge - coupled device ( CCD ) camera ( The Imaging Source Europe GmbH ) mounted on a stereomicroscope ( SZX12 , Olympus Corp . , Waltham , MA ) was used to acquire images at room temperature . A laser scanning confocal scanner ( Leica TCS SP5 ; Leica Microsystems ) mounted on an inverted compound microscope ( DMI6000 , Leica Microsystems ) was used to collect high - resolution time - lapese confocal images . The image acquisition and subsequent analysis of time - lapses sequences used custom - written macros and plug - ins , and image analysis software ( Fiji ) . As the visualization of the streams was very important , two drops of food coloring ( McCormick , green ) were added to a 20 mL central reservoir as previously described [ 75 ] 30 Chapter 3 Probing a Complex Multi - Layer Embryonic Tissue Through Novel 3D Bio - ethching Morphogenesis consists of a complex series of cell signaling , migration and diﬀerentiation events that are coordinated as tissues self - assemble during embryonic development . Studies of collective cell movements have typically been studied in 2D with single layers of cultured cells adhering to rigid substrates such as glass or plastic . In vivo , the intricacies of the 3D microenvironment and complex 3D responses are thought to play critical roles in the forma - tion of functional tissues . To study such processes as collective cell movements within 3D multilayered tissues , we developed a microﬂuidic technique capable of producing complex 3D laminar multicellular structures . We call this technique " 3D tissue - etching " because it is analogous to techniques used in the microelectromechanics ( MEMS ) ﬁeld where complex 3D structures are built by successively removing material from a monolithic solid through subtractive manufacturing . We use a custom - designed microﬂuidic control system to deliver a range of tissue etching reagents ( detergents , chelators , proteases , etc . ) to speciﬁc regions of multilayered tissues . These tissues were previously isolated by microsurgical excision from 31 embryos of the African Claw - toed frog , Xenopus laevis . The ability to shape the 3D form of multicellular tissues and to control 3D stimulation will have a high impact on tissue engineering and regeneration applications in bioengineering and medicine as well as pro - vide signiﬁcant improvements in the synthesis of highly complex 3D integrated multicellular biosystems . 3 . 1 Microﬂuidics in Cell Biology Microﬂuidics have been used in numerous cell biology applications where there is a need to control temporal or spatial stimuli in a microenvironment . Microﬂuidics have become a commomplace tool with the development of soft - lithography methods which allow the easy fabrication of channels in which laminar ﬂows can be combined with minimal mixing [ 3 , 98 ] . Microﬂuidic technology enables spatiotemporal control over living cells [ 99 ] and allows for high - throughput manipulation of the microenviorenment from subcellular to multi - cellular scales . Microﬂuidics oﬀer high molecular selectivity micron scale spatial accuracy to spatially control sub - cellular processes ; a level of control that is extremely challenging without laminar ﬂow , since small molecules diﬀuse across the distance of a cell diameters within seconds [ 100 ] . Spatiotemporal control oﬀered by microﬂuidics allows long - term studies of localized responses of cells and tissues to chemical stimuli , which are critical in numerous areas including developmental biology [ 89 , 101 , 102 ] . Tissue engineers have recently turned to decellularization techniques to isolate signaling factors embedded in tissues and to use those factors for regenerative medicine . Intriguing ex - amples of these include decellularization techniques with the ability to decellularize 3D heart matrix to engineer bioartiﬁcial heart , to decellularize a liver to recellularized liver graft and to decellularize the human vein for vascular tissue - engineering scaﬀold [ 103 – 105 ] . In contrast to these bulk , or whole tissue decellularization approaches where all the cells are removed from a tissue we present a microﬂuidic etching technique for localized removal of targeted 32 cells . We use this approach with a composite tissue consisting of epithelial and mesenchy - mal cell layers to expose interactions between layers in a 3D tissue . Microﬂuidics has been used to control the environment of developmental biology systems such as mechanochemical sensing in Xenopus [ 89 , 106 ] and developmental changes in Drosophila melanogaster em - bryos [ 70 ] . Microﬂuidics applied in developmental biology provides the opportunity to study the coordination of cell behaviors in a 3D environment . 3 . 2 Advantages of 3D Tissue Systems Versus 2D Cell Culture Systems One of the most important properties of 3D tissues during development is the structure and interactions between cells in the tissue . Cells during development and regeneration must orchestrate numerous signaling events ; cells coordinate inputs from 3D cell - cell interactions mediated by receptors and cell - matrix adhesion to regulate cell fate [ 107 , 108 ] . To under - stand these processes requires tools to control 3D cell - cell interactions ; however , conventional approaches are mainly limited to 2D monolayer systems and do not allow manipulation of complex multilayer tissues [ 109 – 111 ] . For example in controlling tissue structure and 3D cell - cell interactions , studies have been conducted on the behavior of epithelial monolayers of cultured cells such as such as human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) or Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells [ 112 ] in response to laser cuts or scratch assays but these methods are restricted to monolayers [ 113 , 114 ] . One limitation of current cell - based approaches is that tissues and organs are 3D , and thus traditional 2D cell culture studies ( e . g . Petri dishes or ﬂasks ) lack important features necessary to accurately replicate cell function and formation [ 115 ] . Cells that are grown on 2D substrates may respond and diﬀerentiate diﬀerently than those in more physiologically relevant 3D environments [ 72 , 116 – 118 ] . Here , we demonstrate a novel microﬂuidic application to etch spatially multi - level mul - 33 ticellular structures while altering the structure and 3D cell - cell interactions in tissues . We manipulate the complex tissues in the Xenopus laevis animal cap ( AC ) , which is composed of stratiﬁed layers of epithelial and mesenchymal cells . We ﬁrst demonstrate that we can make a full cut in a local region through the entire multi - layered AC . We then show that we can cut a similar local region but only removing the top layer of cells of the tissue . Fi - nally we show that we can cut a diﬀerent widths of cells away from deﬁned layers of cells allowing us step - wise spatial precision in cell layer removal for examining in the future 3D cell interactions in tissues . We implemented diﬀerent etching protocols including the chem - icals sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , triton X - 100 , trypsin and sodium hydroxide ( NaOH ) to alter and shape these 3D tissues . We believe our results will provide an approach that will greatly enhance the understanding of tissue remodeling events , which will impact ﬁelds such as cancer , embryonic morphogenesis and wound repair . 3 . 3 Result / Conclusion 3 . 3 . 1 Experimental Technique to etch a composite tissue through 3D Bio - etching To etch 3D tissues , we used our custom - designed microﬂuidic control system to deliver of a range of tissue etching reagents adopted from decellularization protocols over microsurgically isolated early stage embryonic tissue ( Figure3 . 1a ) . Controlling the ﬂow rate at the inner microchannel inlets individually enables precise and dynamic chemical control over the 3D tissue [ 94 ] . Our system implemented a pressure - driven ( nitrogen gas ) approach and included two variable - volume ﬂuid reservoirs with etchants and culture media ( Danilchik’s For Amy solution - DFA ) , two microﬂuidic resistances and a 3 - inlet converging microﬂuidic channel ( Figure 3 . 1b ) . The main microﬂuidic channels and ﬂuidic resistance modules were fabricated with conventional soft lithography techniques from polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) . After 34 Figure 3 . 1 : Probing a complex multi - layer embryonic tissue through novel 3D bio - etching . a ) Schematics and images of two layer animal cap tissue with bottom and side view . b ) Experimental set up for 3D tissue etching and real pictures of microﬂuidic channel c ) Long exposure of AC to a narrow stream of etchant creates a deep through cut of the AC . d ) 3 - inlet microﬂuidic channel schematic and interface control over the time . Green center interface changes over the time with resistances . Side pink resistances stay the same but interface changes according to resistance change in green . Center inlet is set to Case 1 ( C1 ) : lower resistance , Case 2 ( C2 ) : Higher resistance , Case 3 ( C3 ) : shut oﬀ . fabrication the main channels were coated with ﬁbronection . In the main T - shaped , 3 - inlet microﬂuidic channel , the two side inlets had the identical high - ﬂow rate ﬂows , which were controlled by microﬂuidic resistances [ 75 ] with the center inlet having a lower ﬂow rate 35 ( Figure 3 . 1 c ) . These ﬂuidic resistances altered the ﬂow rates that deﬁned the width of the etching streams in the main microﬂuidic channel and thus the width of the areas exposed to the etchants over the apical surface of the tissue ( Figure 3 . 1b ) . Inlet pressures can be dynamically changed to deliver etchant to any location over the apical surface and width of the tissue . The tissue used in these experiments was microsurgically isolated from gastrula stage Xenopus laevis embryo and positioned inside of the outlet of the main channel . The tissue was ﬁrst allowed to adhere to the ﬁbronection coated glass surface for 4 hours . Once adhered , we collected time - lapse sequences of the process of etching and the response of the remaining tissues . Decellularization of organs through using etchants has been used to create ECM for a variety of reconstructive surgical applications and regenerative medicine strategies for tissue and organ replacement [ 119 ] . However , current decellularization aproaches remove all cells to produce foundational scaﬀold ECM to regenerate an organ . In our approach , the goal as to remove only select cells in controlled areas to understand how collective 3D cell responses react . Our tissue etching technique allowed the removal of speciﬁc layers of tissue through exposure to a narrow etchant stream , which removed layers of cells to expose lower layers of cells or even to the supporting substrate such as glass ( Figure 3 . 1 d ) . Here , contrary to decellularization techniques , cells exposed to etchants were removed by culture media not by the etchant . We used Sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) as etchant . After the microsurgically cut tissue is positioned and adhered in the microﬂuidic channel , center inlet is connected to SDS reservoir . Using modular resistances , a narrow center stream delivers the etchant on top of multi layer animal cap tissue . With long exposure time , we get deep etch that has multi - layer height ( Figure 3 . 1 d ) . By reducing the exposure time a single layer of epithelial cells may be removed ( Figure 3 . 2 ) . By controlling the width of the etchant and the exposure time a broader swath of the surface layer may be removed ( Figure 3 . 4 ) . After removal of a broad swath the resistance circuits can be switched and a second narrow stream can remove only a single narrow band within the swath - exposed cells . With this novel 3D bio - etching , depending on the exposure time of the etchant , single or multiple 36 layers can be removed . 3 . 4 Width and depth of the tissue etching regulated by microﬂuidic positioning and duration of detergent stream . As a ﬁrst step we removed all of the layers in a spatially controlled region of the 3D Xenopus AC . To accomplish this , we ﬁrst used sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) as an etchant . After positioning and adhering the microsurgically excised in the microﬂuidic channel , the center inlet was connected to the SDS reservoir . We started the pressure driven ﬂow and opened the valves of the side inlets . After the DFA was in the entire main channel and the ﬂow equilibrated , the center inlet’s valve was opened to start the etching process . Using modular ﬂuidic resistance modules , a narrow center stream delivered the etchant to the apical layer of the multi layer animal cap tissue . By controlling the width of the etchant and the exposure time a broader swath of cells may be removed . We also used this methodology to remove multiple layers of cells through the entire AC so that the interacting substrate was exposed , but only in the speciﬁed regions where cells were previously removed ; we call this a “through cut” approach ( Figure3 . 1 d ) . To create more complex structures we limited the amount of time the tissue was exposed to SDS . By reducing the exposure time a single layer of epithelial cells was removed ( Figure 3 . 2 ) , which we called a “single cut” . For the single cut , after the ﬁrst layer was etched , the middle inlet of the microﬂuidic system containing the etchant was closed to stop the ﬂow of the etchant . This approach created a discontinuous region of epithelial cells ( EL ) over a mesenchymal cell layer ( ML ) ( Figure 3 . 2 ) . Where the EL is continuous it remains in contact with the deeper mesenchymal layer . The width of the etched gap in the epithelium was controlled by modulating the central inlet ﬂow rate by changing microﬂuidic resistance 37 modules ( Figure 3 . 2c ) . With this approach we controlled the etching depth and width of the epithelial layer in a spatiotemporally controlled manner . The single cut approach created a free margin in the epithelial cell layer that remains in contact with deep mesenchymal cells . The viability of the cells in the tissue were directly related to their exposure to the etchant ( Figure 3 . 3 ) . 3 . 5 Multi - step etching can create novel 3D tissues By repositioning the microﬂuidic stream after a single cut we created a 3D ’tiered’ tissue . After the removal of a broad swath of epithelial cells we switched resistance modules to produce a more focused stream and create another free edge in the mesenchymal cell layer ( Figure 3 . 4a ) . To create the step like spatially etched structures requires sequential steps ( Figure 3 . 4 b and c ) . As before the DFA reservoir was connected to a lower resistance and then connected to two side inlets . The width of etchant was based on the ratio of resistance modules in the side inlets compared to the middle inlet . In the ﬁrst step , two higher ﬂuidic resistance modules , namely the R - 60 length of the channel , were connected in parallel to each other with the same resistance of an R - 10 module . The etchant reservoir was connected to two of the same resistance modules with a T connector ( Figure 3 . 4b ) . This conﬁguration with etchant inlet : side inlet resistance modules in the ratio 1 : 3 cut a deﬁned region of the EL with a relatively wide stream in the main channel . In step two , one of the resistance modules leading to the etchant channel was closed oﬀ to create an etchant : side ratio of 1 : 6 . The increase in the resistance to the etchant ﬂow caused the middle stream to narrow ( Figure 3 . 4c ) . The narrow stream of etchant then acts on the ML without contacting the EL since the EL was already removed in step 1 ( Figure 3 . 4d ) . Resistances can be manually changed in a few seconds so that a narrow cut with the ML can be made within a wider region that cut through the EL ( Figure 3 . 4e ) . With spatiotemporal control of the etchant our microﬂuidic technique enables multiple rounds of etching , which we have used to create “step” shaped 38 Figure 3 . 2 : Single layer etching of a 3D AC tissue . a ) Schematics of a single epithelial layer etched animal cap tissue with top and side views . b ) Experimental time sequence of a single cut embryonic tissue undergoing bioetching over 180 seconds . % 0 . 3 SDS was used as etching chemical . c ) Interface control over the time with intensity proﬁle over the time during etching . Green center interface is set by R - 30 during etching . After the epithelial layer was etched , the center inlet was closed oﬀ so that the etchant was no longer on the AC . Side pink interfaces are set by R - 10 . 39 Figure 3 . 3 : Explant viability test . Live / Dead Cell viability assays were used to highlight the viability of the cells after the detergent treatment . This assay conﬁrms that most cells were alive after the detergent treatment . Green : Live cell Red : dead cell margins within 3D animal cap tissue . The removal of the etchant was also analyzed when the inlet channels was closed ( Figure 3 . 5 ) . 3 . 6 Alternative etchants In addition to SDS we tested other detergents , enzymes , and bases for their ability to remove cells from tissues . Detergents have been extensively used to decellularize tissues and organs by solubilizing cell membranes and dissociate DNA from proteins [ 119 ] . Sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , which is anionic detergent , is eﬀective in solubilizing numerous proteins by disrupting non - covalent bonds within and between proteins . However , detergents can disrupt or dissociate desired proteins from the ECM . Furthermore , SDS may also denature ECM proteins resulting in the potential loss of their native conformation and function . Non - ionic detergents , often called non - denaturing detergents , like Triton X - 100 are potentially useful 40 Figure 3 . 4 : Reﬁned etching . a ) Schematics of double layer subtractive manufactured animal cap tissue with top and side view . % 0 . 3 SDS was used as the etching chemical . b ) The AC is ﬁrst exposed using a wider stream to remove a width of the top cell layers . The center inlet resistance is lower to create a wider interface . Second step of experimental technique for double cut embryonic tissue bioetching . Center inlet resistance is higher thus interface is thinner . c ) Time lapse images of double etching showing the removal of the top layer and then the bottom layers of cells over 100 seconds . d ) Interface control over the time with intensity proﬁle over the time during etching . Center interface ( green ) is set by R - 30 and switched to R - 60 during etching . After epithelial layer followed by mesenchymal layer is etched , center inlet was shut down . Side pink interfaces are set by R - 10 . 41 Figure 3 . 5 : Channel kymograph showing the speed of the detergent removal . The intensity proﬁle in the channel was plotted to show how quickly the detergent stream was removed . In 5 seconds , the detergent stream was completely removed . The intensity proﬁle at 760um was plotted versus time to analyze the intensity changes when the detergent stream was turned on and oﬀ . Since the detergent was mixed with the dye , the detergent stream intensity proﬁle showed the stream location in the channel . since they break lipid - lipid and lipid - protein interactions and leave more protein - protein interactions intact . For this reason , Triton X - 100 is often used to isolate biologically active membrane proteins . Following our work with SDS , we examined the eﬀects of Triton X - 100 . We used 3 % Triton X - 100 as an etchant to create single cuts in the epithelium to expose a 42 broad swath of mesenchymal cells ( Figure 3 . 6 a ) . Triton X - 100 did not appear to remove the epithelial layer as well as SDS . We noticed that the removal of epithelial and mesenchymal cells within the etched regions took much longer than with SDS . . Next , we used base sodium hydroxide ( NaOH ) as an etchant , since strong bases can aﬀect ECM mechanical properties and NaOH is known to disrupt tissue architecture [ Gall and Pardue , 1969 ] . Using 0 . 1M NaOH with the previously described approach for single - cut etching removed a single cell layer within 80 seconds ( Figure 3 . 6 b ) . Other potential etchants are proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin , which provide high speciﬁcity for removal of cell residues and undesirable ECM constituents . Complete cell removal by enzymatic treatment alone is diﬃcult , however , and residual enzymes and partially denatured proteins as well as highly charged nucleic acids may impair recellularization [ 120 ] . We used the proteolytic enzyme trypsin as an etchant . Trypsin is commonly used in cell culture protocols to dissociate cell monolayers from substrates , but the ability of trypsin to etch cells locally from a substrate was not known . We found that trypsin did not remove cell layers even when the tissue was exposed for much longer time periods ( 15 + minutes ) ( Figure 3 . 6 c ) . 3 . 7 Conclusion We demonstrated the ability to create and shape 3D tissues with subtractive manufactur - ing or “tissue - etching” using a microﬂuidics based approach . While many approaches use 2D environments with monolayers , our unique microﬂuidic technique provided the ability to control the 3D environment and study the interactions of individual epithelial and mes - enchymal layers . We used the animal cap ectoderm of the Xenopus laevis embryo as a model system for the study of tissue bio - etching in embryonic cell layers as they are multi - layered with both an epithelial and a mesenchymal layer , and are well suited to microscopy analysis . The cells of the animal cap are considered to have similarities to mammalian embryonic stem cells , which may provide insight into stem cell response in the future as well . Since our 43 Figure 3 . 6 : Etching of the AC 3D tissue under the application of diﬀerent etchants . The single cut approach was used and the etchant was applied to the apical side of the AC over time . The deteregents that were used were a ) nonionic detergent , % 3 Triton X - 100 , b ) base , 0 . 1N NaOH , and c ) biological agent , trypsin . 44 method introduced a new chemical bio - etching method with a precise spatial and temporal control of the etched area , this precise positioning allowed us to construct novel epithelial and mesenchymal tissue architectures . We are able to induce through single cuts and double cuts tremendous precision in shaping 3D tissues . The deep cells below the EL removed by etchants were not exposed unless the stream remained after the cells dissociated and were removed by ﬂow . Also , short exposures to etchants were quickly washed away with fresh media , which replaced the etchant in the microﬂuidic chamber . Unlike decellularization ap - proaches , this technique leaves most cells viable . Thus , this 3D tissue - etching assay will be useful in the future to study mechanical responses , collective cell sheet migration , and explore processes that are used to coordinate composite tissues during morphogenesis . The ability to control the form of multicellular 3D tissues will have high impact in the allied ﬁelds of tissue engineering and regeneration medicine as well as insight into cancer and stem cell biology . 45 Chapter 4 Studying Collective Cell Migration of Multi - layer Embryonic Tissue Using 3D Bio - etching 4 . 1 Collective Cell Migration The coordinated cell migration is critical to embryonic development , homeostasis , complex organs systems , and diseases such as cancer [ 111 ] . Therefore , studying collective cell migra - tion to understand these important topics , several model organisms such as Xenopus lae - vis [ 21 ] , Drosophila melanogaster [ 22 ] , Danio rerio [ 23 ] are used to determine what molecules are important in initiating , maintaining and guiding moving cells . In such migration , cells move collectively as sheets , strands or clusters by using the guidance of numerous chemical and mechanical signals [ 121 ] . In single cell migration , cells move individually and change their location from one place to another in response to the cues that exist in the envi - ronment [ 122 ] . Collective migration , though , is diﬀerent from single cell migration in that collections of individual cells function as a single unit and stay adhered to each other as they move , which results in migrating cohorts that varies degrees of tissue organization [ 123 – 125 ] . 46 Collective cell sheet migration is an important process that sculpts the shape of an organism and its internal tissues during early development [ 26 ] . Hence , failure of collective cell mi - gration during development causes fatal consequences like immunosuppresion , autoimmune diseases , defective wound repair , or tumor dissemination . Morphogenesis consists of a complex series of cell signaling , migration and diﬀerentiation that are coordinated during both embryo development and cases of tissue self - assembly [ 125 ] . Developmental model systems such as Xenopus laevis , a carnivorous claw - toed frog native to Africa , have been widely used to study intricate development processes such as patterning and morphogenesis during gastrulation . Xenopus embryogenesis consists of serial important processes starting within the ﬁrst 90 - minute cell cycle at 21 ◦ C . After the ﬁrst division , cell proliferation is rather fast with 20 to 30 minute intervals . About seven hours after fertilization , when there are 4096 cells ( after 12 cleavages ) , the embryo begins to change dramatically . Cell division intervals increase to four hours , and cells start to change their shape to become more elongated and bottle - like [ ? , ? ] . At the mid - blastula stage , the embryos have three regions – the animal cap ( AC ) , marginal zone and vegetal mass ( Figure4 . 1 ) [ 8 ] . After mid - blastula transition is completed , cells at the surface start relocating to more interior locations . This orchestrated movement is deﬁned as gastrulation where a ball of cells turns into multi - layer tissue . Convergent extension of these bottle - shaped cells creates a dorsal lip of blastopore which is an indicator of the beginning of gastrulation [ 126 ] . During gastrulation , the embryo is dramatically restructured by processes such as cell migration [ 20 ] . Gastrulation is crucial to the proper development of all multicellular animals , especially those with complex tissues ( Figure4 . 2 ) . Collective movements in vivo are key to the gas - trulation where single embryonic layer blastula is rearranged to form three layer structure ( ectoderm , mesoderm , endoderm ) . Each layer gives rise to speciﬁc tissues and organs in de - veloping embryo . Formation of the ectoderm is essential for establishment of the epidermis and nervous 47 Figure 4 . 1 : Characteristic of Xenopus laevis early development . A ) Diﬀerent stages of Xeno - pus laevis embryos . B ) Schematics of sliced sections from diﬀerent stages . [ 8 ] Figure 4 . 2 : Xenopus laevis blastula stage fate map showing primary germ layers : Ectoderm , Mesoderm , Endoderm . [ 9 ] 48 system . In this thesis , I used tissues microsurgically isolated from embryos of Xenopus , the animal cap , which are fated to be ectoderm later in normal development . Xenopus embryos are used to elucidate genes important in morphogenesis and here provide a model for collective migration of a complex tissue . The animal cap tissue is a composite tissue with two layers : epithelial ( pigmented cells , facing external media ) and mesenchymal ( non - pigmented cells , lower tissue facing interstitial media ) layers . These layers can be dissected from the embryo ( dashed lines ; Figure 4 . 1 ) . Dissected animal cap tissue survive and continue to develop its pre - programmed fate as it would in an embryo in a simple salt solution for several hours . Importantly , the Xenopus animal cap does not respond to nonspeciﬁc biological perturbation but respond diﬀerentially to molecules that are active in the environment and can diﬀerentiate into speciﬁc types of neural , mesodermal , and endodermal tissues ( Figure 4 . 3 ) . Hence , the cells of the animal cap are equivalent to mammalian embryonic stem cells . Finding from Xenopus laevis AC studies underlie many recent advances in stem cell biology [ 10 ] . Animal cap tissues ( AC ) are an excellent model to investigate the coordinated cell movements within multilayered tissues since it is multi - layered . In contrast to the studies of collective cell movements in epithelial monolayers of cultured cells , multi layered animal cap tissue can reveal information about collective cell migration and tissue self - assembly in composite tissues . Animal cap tissue has always been popular model for understanding cellular activities from the one - cell stage to organ level as animal cap tissue goes through massive cell rearrangements that are crucial for the animal’s fate during gastrulation . During epiboly , which occurs at the same time as gastrulation , cell layers start to spread and thin . Animal cap tissues begin ﬁve to six cells thick and thins to two cell layers by the end of gastrulation [ 11 ] . Studies showed no evidence of death but rather showed that deep cells rearrange their shapes , thin and extend from thick multilayers to one thin layer [ 127 ] . Though individual cell movements have been described [ 127 , 128 ] , the cellular mechanisms behind these movements have not been revealed . Conventional studies target the functions of certain signaling pathways of 49 Figure 4 . 3 : Animal Cap Assay [ 10 ] an individual cell layer to be able to understand the multilayer mechanism of thinning . Multi - layer mechanisms might be challenging to anticipate from single layer studies , since multiple signals plays role in a spatiotemporal manner . However , understanding multi - layer coordinated movement is also important in the areas of biotechnology to engineer artiﬁcial tissues and develop new techniques to control tumor cells . Similarly , wound healing is a critical part of human physiology that involves numerous synchronized events including inﬂammation , tissue formation and remodeling [ ? , ? ] . While wound healing is common across many organisms , the ability to reestablish tissue integrity involves many events including chemical and mechanical processes [ ? , 129 ] . The chemical and mechanical components are an integrated response with 3D features that enable repair to occur . In embryos , wounds heal faster and without a leaving scar , and thus there is an interest in understanding wound healing in embryonic level to improve the adult wound healing [ 129 , 130 ] . Understanding the 3D nature of this process would provide advances on numerous fronts including developmental biology and regenerative medicine . Most wound healing studies are carried out in 2D with single layers of cultured epithelial cells adhering to 50 Figure 4 . 4 : Animal Cap thins during gastrulation . A and B shows the beginning of the gastrulation ( stage 9 ) and C and D shows the end of the gastrulation . Cell outlines visualized using antisera to C - cadherin ( scale bars = 300 µ m in A and C ; scale bars = 75 µ m in B and D ) [ 11 ] rigid substrates such as glass or plastic . But in real tissues , the intricacies of the 3D microen - vironment and complex 3D responses are extremely important to more fully understand and address wound healing . A recent study revealed complex interactions between a heterogeneously patterned sub - strate and the cell mechanics that guides collective migration . These interactions resulted in the formation of multicellular " bridges " [ 14 ] . Studies of these collective cell movements have focused on the behavior of epithelial monolayers of cultured cells such as Madin Darby canine kidney MDCK cells . By contrast , most embryonic development and tissue self - assembly re - quires the integration of cell movements within multiple cell layers composed of diﬀerent cell types . Although the role of cell mechanics in tissue self - assembly has been demonstrated , little is known about the mechanical response of the multi - layer tissues to environmental cues . One of the reasons for this knowledge gap is the lack of the technologies to analyze the individual responses of epithelial and mesenchymal cell sheets in a multi - cell layer tissue . 51 4 . 2 Studying Collective Cell Migration Using Microﬂu - dics Microﬂuidics provide highly controlled spatial and temporal chemical patterns to overcome the complications of traditional methods . Understanding the underlying signaling pathways of collective cell functions requires highly regulated control mechanisms . Since scale of size is well matched to physical dimensions of biological studies , microﬂuidics have been used in cel - lular biology to utilize laminar ﬂow beneﬁts of delivering precise chemicals . However , these studies are mostly limited to either single cells or monolayer sheets . Cells must communicate to combine into networks , such as tissue and organs . Thus higher levels of organization is required to make assumptions for a 3D animal models . Bio - etching technique gives the op - portunity to study collective cell arrangements in 3D fashion . I used unique 3D microﬂuidics approach to examine integrated 3D responses of cell mechanics and cell - cell interactions in a more realistic system using Xenopus . My experiments suggest the hypothesis that complex tissues , composed of multiple cell types including both epithelial and mesenchymal cells are mechanically coupled and that by locally inhibiting the mechanics of speciﬁc layers I was able to expose novel features of collective migration within the integrated tissue . Using a custom - designed microﬂuidic control system to deliver a range of tissue etching reagents ( detergents , chelators , proteases , etc . ) , I etched the desired width and depth of the superﬁcial epithelial and deep mesenchymal layers using diﬀerent types of etchants as described in Chapter 3 . Bio - etching allows me to produce diﬀerent classes of wounds and analyze coordinated responses of the remaining tissue . 52 4 . 3 Collective Multi - layer Response to " Subtractive Man - ufacturing " of Single Layer Bio - etching Removing select cells from the epithelial layer left a discontinuous region of epithelial layer ( EL ) being intact with mesenchymal cell layer ( ML ) . Previously , laminar ﬂow of trypsin solution in microﬂuidic channels has been shown as an example of wound healing assay ( Figure 4 . 5 ) . 2D scratch wound assays are used to asses the following parameters : speed of wound clo - sure , width of the defect , cohesiveness of the cell - cell junctions and individual or collective cell polarization and migration [ 29 ] . Contrary to these 2D studies , this system provides well - controlled cell removal of a portion of 3D integrated tissue as opposed to monolayer examples . I speciﬁcally focused on the cell migration in the top layer , as the epithelial cells move to " heal " over the mesenchymal cell layer ( Figure4 . 6b ) . To track the movement , I had options such as the replaying time lapse movies , creating kymographs and strain maps . I used the kymograph to see the dynamics by using ImageJ ( Figure4 . 6c ) . Kymographs of the vertical line ( dotted ) in the center of the tissues were used to show the dynamic responses eﬀectively . This kymograph clearly showed that in the process of epithelial layer healing the center of the tissue edge of the explant stopped spreading and involved to wound healing . This shows the distance of signal transmission within the tissue or strain equilibrium in response to closing the gap in the middle . I also noticed from kymographs that speed of closure was higher than normal speed of AC spreading . To examine further , I looked at the area decrease of etched area over the time to quantify cell movements ( Figure 4 . 6d ) . It is clear from Figure 4 . 6 d that more than half of the closure of the etched area was completed in ﬁrst 20 minutes . For the ﬁrst few minutes , the speed of closure seemed to be higher than the rest . Additionally , I plotted the intensity proﬁle over time to examine the behavior of epithelial cells in ﬁrst 20 minutes compared to the rest ( Figure 4 . 6e ) . Since epithelial layer dark pigmented and mesenchymal layer is non - pigmented , intensity proﬁle pictures the etched area as etched 53 areas intensity is lower compared to non - etched areas . Intensity graph also indicated the diﬀerences in speed of cells within ﬁrst 20 minutes . I used custom written macros to calculate the velocity and displacement values from time lapse movies that are acquired with steremicroscope ( Figure 4 . 7 ) . Images are collected every second for bio - etching stacks and every minutes for healing stacks . First , I used segmentation to generate masks for every image from left over EL . Segmentation creates binary stack for macros . Macros written by Dr . Holley E . Lynch used the mask to ﬁnd the centroids , and then draw a line at given angle from the centroid to linearly calculate the edge movement from centroid . This macro tracks the edge for every image that are given and calculates the velocity and displacement for every pixel on the line . I used linear displacement macro to analyze free edge of two layers and EL movement . Velocities are presented in microns per minute . Velocity graph ( Figure 4 . 7 a ) highlighted a peak in the velocity in ﬁrst few minutes of healing . Although the fastest known cell speed is 600 microns per hour by keratocytes [ 131 ] , this peak is equal to 1000 micron per hour . Displacement graph ( Figure 4 . 7 ) shows that free edge of two cell layer , the other edge of remaining EL also stopped spreading and contributed the healing process although the speed of that edge is not as high as free edge of EL . A potential explanation for outer edge being not as fast is the distance from the removal area . The diﬀerence in displacement values indicates that explant is experiencing high strain . Overall , this single layer bio - etching provided us free edge of epithelial layer to study the response of removing neighboring cells on mesenchymal cells in more 3D relevant environment . 54 Figure 4 . 5 : On - chip monolayer cell migration assay using microﬂuidic channels [ 12 ] 4 . 4 Collective Multilayer Response to " Subtractive Man - ufacturing " I then used multi - step subtractive manufacturing to remove a desired part of the epithelial and mesenchymal layer to further test if these two layers are mechanically connected in complex tissues , and if superﬁcial layers provide cues that coordinate collective migration in deep cells . Deep cells contribution to collective cell migration is often ignored because of the lack of the technology to study the layer under another . Davidson et . al . studied the excision wounds in whole embryo [ 13 ] . In this paper , mesenchymal and epithelial and mesenchymal layer behavior were studied in response to microsurgical wounds . They showed that deep cell contraction and ingression was responsible for wound healing in Xenopus laevis animal caps ( Figure 4 . 8 ) . Here , I connected the ﬂuidic resistances in parallel to be able to increase the resistances simultaneously at desired time during experiment . The relation between pressure drop along the channel downstream and the ﬂow rate Q is analogous to Ohm’s Law for electrical circuits 55 Figure 4 . 6 : Single Cut Healing a ) Schematic of single layer etched tissue with Z - cut side view and top view .

Green : free edge of two - cell layer Orange : Free edge of EL with ﬂuid pressure drop for electrical potential diﬀerence . Considering N element with individual resistances R m , m = 1 , . . . , N , there are two simple situations the resistances are either in series or in parallel , as is familiar from elementary courses : When the elements are 57 Figure 4 . 8 : Steps in embryonic wound healing in the Xenopus laevis animal cap ectoderm in response micro surgically removal of epithelial cell layer [ 13 ] . placed in series , the eﬀective resistance R e ff of the combination is : Reff = N (cid:88) m = 1 R m ( 4 . 1 ) In contrast , when elements are placed parallel , the eﬀective resistance R e ff is : Reff = 1 (cid:80) Nm = 1 R − 1 m ( 4 . 2 ) Using this notion , I used a microﬂuidic system in which pressure is regulated by resistances that were placed in parallel ( Figure 4 . 9 ) . This conﬁguration helped me to change the interface in the channel during the experiment in seconds . With this design , the width of the center 58 Figure 4 . 9 : Interface control for reﬁned etching a ) Schematic of pressure regulation system . b ) Fluidic circuit diagram of the system for reﬁned etching . To change the interface , at the ﬁrst step , switch is on ( both valves are open ) , at the second step , switch is oﬀ ( one of the valve is closed ) in the third modular mechanism . inlet is regulated and manipulated without any need to stop experiment . Simply changing the resistances from R - 30 to R - 60 provided me a wide and then a narrow stream ( half width ) , and so I used these two diﬀerent widths of detergent stream to etch the EL and ML layer , respectively . Here , I used reﬁned bio - etching technique in two steps . First , I connected the resistances parallel which makes the total resistances and thus the ﬂow rate lower ( Figure 4 . 9b ) . With this interface , I ﬁrst etched the desired epithelial layer . I collected time lapse sequences every second . Once the epithelial layer was cleaved , I closed one of the R - 60 resistance valve resulting in a higher resistance in the center inlet . Because of the drop in ﬂow - rate in the 59 middle channel , middle interface becomes narrow . In the second step , desired ( half width of epithelial etched ) mesenchymal stripe was cleaved . Carefully looking at the movies whenever the desired mesenchymal layer is etched , middle inlet valve is closed oﬀ and I collected time - lapse movies every minute for 10 hours to capture the response of AC to reﬁned bio - etching ( Figure 4 . 10 ) . Reﬁned etching technique is a great way to study mechanical coupling between layers since this double step subtractive manufacturing provides a 3D environment to study multicellular interactions . After multi step reﬁned etching , epithelial and mesenchymal layer both have etched areas leaving two " islands " behind . At this point , animal cap is not intact but etched three - dimensionally ( Figure 4 . 10a ) . The epithelial layer and the mesenchymal layer show behavior resembling wound healing to close the etched area . Mesenchymal cell layer contracts immediately and keep contracting until EL spreads back again . There seems to be a communication and " help " between these two cell layer that has not been shown before . That makes the system a very unique tool to study collective reorganization and migration in response to removal of their neighbors . Explant attachment experiments were imaged with a digital charge - coupled device ( CCD ) camera mounted on a stereoscope . Computer - controlled acquisition software was used to collect time - lapse sequences to collect the data for long hours until the explant completely " heals " and start spreading again ( Figure 4 . 10b ) . Time - lapse movies are analyzed using ImageJ . First I looked at the information about cell movements with kymographs ( Figure 4 . 10c ) . Kymographs are very powerful to highlight the cell movement within the explant . Kymograph graph data is collected from the dotted line shown Figure 4 . 10a . The kymograph shows the same peak velocity that was observed with single layer etching within ﬁrst minutes . Hence , I plotted the velocity diﬀerences in two types of free edges in response to reﬁned multi step etching ( Figure4 . 10d ) to depict the peak velocity . Velocity analysis showed that epithelial cells moves much faster than they normally do especially right after the etching . Animal cap cells migrate with a speed of 50 µ m per hour , but here within the ﬁrst few minutes , their speed goes up more than 1500 µ m per hour 60 Figure 4 . 10 : Reﬁned Bio - etching Healing a ) Schematic of reﬁned etched multilayer animal cap .

Dotted line above indicates where the data is collected . d ) Velocity diﬀerences of free edge of the EL and free edge of two - cell layer . The free edge of the EL peaks up to 1500um in an hour . e ) Diﬀerences in displacement at the two diﬀerent edges when layers are moving to reestablish their contact . which is even more than any known speed of any type of cell and faster than single layer etching . My hypothesis is because of the mesenchymal cell layer contribution . I hypothesize that mesenchymal cells attach to the leading epithelial cell and pull it while they ingress and 61 contracts as it is shown ( Figure 4 . 8 ) . It was shown that healing is driven by deep cell contraction and ingression . On the other hand , reﬁned multi - layer etching causes explant to lose contact with the other half of the explant . The data shows that the epithelial layer moves towards the etched area of mesenchymal layer ﬁrst to regain the missed contact with etching . During this time , the mesenchymal layer stops its own fated behavior of spreading and rather contracts until the epithelial layer completely covers the mesenchymal layer . Then they start spreading together ( Figure 4 . 10 b t = 180 - 300min ) . After second step , ML etching especially , cells have no way of communicating because of the ﬂow in between . However , two pieces of remaining cell layers seemed to migrate back and reestablish their contact with the other piece before they start spreading again . I suspect the ﬁbrils that might be left over from the cells that have been etched that cells prefer to spread that area . Additionally , judging from the physical connectivity of the outer edge - free edge of the two cell layer - and the inner edge velocity - free edge of epithelial cell layer - , I believed that there is a mechanical coupling between these two cell layers ( Figure 4 . 10 e ) . Also , one easily can see the strain that explant is experiencing during this migration by looking at the displacement diﬀerences between two edges . I also expressed live cell reporters such as plasma membrane targeted GFP , histone labeled H2B , and use real time inverted confocal microscopy to reveal ﬁne scale cellular responses to micro - environmental features . To express live cell reposters , messenger RNAs ( mRNAs ) are injected at one cell stage within 90 minutes after fertilization ( before ﬁrst division ) to have a even distribution of ﬂuorescence in the embryo . To inject , sharp micro needle are prepared using micropipette puller . Pulled needles are kept sterile and should not be touched without gloves . Embryos that are transferred to Ficoll solution are injected using micro - manipulator . The micro - manipulator applies certain amount of pressure to push out certain amount of liquid out from needle . This pressure is determined by the amount that is being injected . Oil can be used to make bubbles thus measure the right amount before injecting the embryo . Using the manipulator , I usually inject 3 times from animal side of the embryo 62 and embryos are cultured as usual . First I injected 70K dextran as cytoplasm marker . I etched as described above and ﬁxed the explant . Fixing explant preserves the shape of the cells and provides valuable information about cellular architecture right after etching . Then , I injected live reporters of GFP and H2B to reveal the mechanism in the mesenchymal side in high resolution . GFP ( magenta ) was used to label the cell membrane where H2B ( yellow ) was used for nucleus . For confocal movies , microﬂuidic chambers with explants housed inside were placed on an x - y position controlled stage , and time - lapse sequences for translocation experiments were recorded using a confocal scanning head ( Leica TCS SP5 : Leica Microsystems , Bannockburn IL ) mounted on an inverted compound microscope . Confocal images with ﬂuorescing explants give more detailed information at cell size level from the mesenchymal layer side whereas stereoscope gives more collective migration info from the epithelial layer side ( Figure 4 . 11a ) . Etched explants were moved to confocal and I acquired time lapse movies for healing to study the dynamic cellular mechanism with high resolution confocal imaging for 5 hours ( Figure 4 . 11 b ) . Time - lapse sequences were analyzed either manually or with custom - image processing macros ( ImageJ ) . This confocal lime lapse movies indicated that the EL immediately to migrate toward etched area with very high speed . In the mean time the ML contracts and shrinks in size ( Figure 4 . 11 c ) . This graph depicts the mechanical coupling and collective movement in response to removal of neighboring cells . Retraction of ML usually last an hour and within this hour EL covers ML and they start migrating towards etched area in cohorts . Free edge of two - cell layer also moves towards etched area as a result of transit chemical signals . When continuous tissue is broken , chemical signal from wounded edge enhances forces towards free surface in result of large lamelipodia . Every cells contributes and generates traction forces in the order of the distance to wounded edge [ 132 ] . In results of this arrangements in tissue , two cell layer outer edge migrates in a slower rate ( Figure 4 . 11 d ) . I showed the synchronized cellular behavior in response to removal of neighboring cell 63 Figure 4 . 11 : Inverted confocal images of reﬁned multilayer etched animal cap healing . a ) Dextran injected , ﬁxed animal cap explants .

Scale bar is 50um . c ) Vertical length changes of ML and EL . This graph shows that EL layer ( grey line ) spreads and extends while ML contracts and shrinks until EL covers ML . This graph supports the hypothesis of mechanical coupling between EL and ML . d ) Displacement of free edge of EL ( red ) and free edge of two cell layer ( blue ) . In 2 hours , EL layer and ML restore and start spreading . in EL and ML with narrow single layer etching and reﬁned double layer etching . Two cell layer other edges seemed to respond to narrow etching that was in the center of the explant . This suggested the communication and collectiveness between cells over a long distance as a result of the changed force ﬁelds and strain rate . The contribution of the ML helps the EL accelerate the healing migration speed to heal faster . This technique reveals an important information about other layers contribution to epithelial layer for migration . Monolayer 64 epithelial cell migration studies cannot carry out the crosstalk between layers . In single layer removal , removal of EL on top of the ML caused the ML change its own fate from spreading to contracting and shrinking . Shrinking of cell volume has been studied and shown in chick cells in response wound healing , too . Some suggest that wound forma - tion releases calcium ions into the nearby environment , and this immediately triggers the contraction of any actomyosin in the vicinity [ 130 ] . This might be how the ML contracts . Contraction of ML might be the ﬁrst response of multi phase wound healing response . Even further , my hypothesis is that superﬁcial cell provides cues that coordinate collective migra - tion in deep cells . To test that this , I etched superﬁcial layer layer completely and watch ML response to removal of EL ( Figure 4 . 12 ) . This experiment supported my hypothesis , ML did not spread when EL was removed . Mesenchymal layer showed contraction for 6 hours and started to spread . In 6 hours of etching , mesenchymal layer cells clustered and layer got thickened . After 6 hours , mesenchymal cells mostly probably went through mesenchymal - epithelial transition ( MET ) and epithelialized . To gain a better understanding of the cellular mechanism between two layers in a collective rearrangements in response to removal of neighboring cells , I then set up another experiment where I cleaved the half of the EL leaving half of the ML uncovered ( Figure 4 . 14 ) . This set up is great tool to compare the ML migration itself and two - cell layer migration . Removing half of the EL provided bigger EL etched area thus bigger ML uncovered proving bigger size of ML underneath . Here , ﬂuidic resistances were set to same resistance to have the same ﬂow rate in both inlets thus have the same width in the channel . Half of the microﬂuidic channel was culture media ( pink ) whereas the other half was detergent ( green ) ( Figure 4 . 14 b ) . Interface was kept in the middle of the channel until EL was cleaved , then detergent inlet valve was turn oﬀ . I acquired the time lapse movie every second when etching and every minute when healing to see the reopens of explant to removal of the half superﬁcial layer ( ﬁgure 4 . 14 b and c ) . Interface is not as clear in these ﬁgures because of the deﬁcient dye in the detergent . The dotted line in the ﬁgure shows where the interface was . Etching duration 65 Figure 4 . 12 : Mesenchymal layer response to whole epithelial layer etching . Left - over mes - enchymal layer was observed for 10 hours . was longer than previously because of the area to be etched . After etching was done , I turned oﬀ the valve of detergent and ﬂow only DFA for 10 hours ( Figure 4 . 14 c ) . Healing of half EL removed explant showed that ML did not migrate and spread without an EL on top . EL on the other hand , showed contraction before spreading . In contrast to other experiments , outer two - cell layer edge , started spreading and migrating before EL completely covers ML . In ﬁrst 20 minutes of velocity proﬁles of these two edges ( black : free de of EL and gold : free edge of two cell layer ) showed no collective behavior . Etched edge showed a peak velocity in few minutes as in previous examples but this peak velocity duration was longer than previous ones ( Figure 4 . 14 d ) . On the other hand , outer two - cell layer etched did not move to etched side and kept spreading . My explanation for this is the distance from etched side . Outer edge was too far to received the transmit forces and signals . To see where the transmission 66 Figure 4 . 13 : Displacement vectors during left - over epithelial layer re - epithelization over mes - enchymal layer . Red dotted line shows the boundary of transmited broken tissue integrity boundary , I used displacement vectors ( Figure 4 . 13 ) . Displacement vectors were generated by custom written macro in Fiji . It uses the displacement of each pixel points and generates vectors that shows the direction and magnitude of displacement . Eventually all tissues recovered with a scar and re - epithelialized , started to spread in all direction . I was able to demonstrate the fact that the ML does not migrate until the EL completely covers it . EL showed a diﬀerent velocity proﬁle indicating that cell migration speed of layers might be depended on the free area or left over EL size . To highlight the diﬀerences in these three diﬀerent responses in term of the migration speed , I put all dis - placement data in the same graph . Displacements were calculated at the peak velocity part of the explant for an hour ( Figure 4 . 15 ) . This graph pointed out that the half removed EL migrated the most . Although peak velocity is the highest in multi - layer etching , half EL removal migrated more than multi - layer etching . This also supports the hypothesis of mesenchymal layer contribution to epithelial movement since there is more ML area in half removed then multi - layer etching . Manipulating the architecture of a tissue means changing the strain proﬁles of the cellular 67 Figure 4 . 14 : Removing half of the epithelial layer by Reﬁned Bio - etching . a ) Schematic of reﬁned etched multilayer animal cap . b ) Left : Schematic of microﬂuidic channel with animal cap explant housed in with interface control graph .

Overall , half of EL removal migrated the most in response to etching . This indicates that there is a correlation between left over EL area , remaining ML area and displacement rate . layers . By cleaving the part of the layer releases the strain in that speciﬁc layer . I used custom written macros to calculate the strain that tissue experiences after the etching . These macros were written based on a free code plug in ( bUnwarpJ ) , and it uses simultaneous registration of two images based on elastic deformations represented by B - splines . It calculates the changes of a distance between two pixels from one image to another and elastically deforms the ﬁrst image to make it look like the second one . It uses similarity term and the consistency term of the energy function . Strain proﬁles are generated using color - coded ( red : contraction blue : relaxation ) strain proﬁle maps . I calculated strain proﬁles of left - over EL in response to removal of the other half ( Figure 4 . 16 ) . Strain proﬁles provide the individual pixel movement information in entire left over tissue thus let us to see the response globally rather than at the edges . Strain proﬁles can be calculated in any frame rate . Here , I showed change in strain in ﬁve minutes time intervals since the biggest rearrangement occurred in ﬁrst 20 minutes . I also showed the last twenty minutes of an hour time period to highlight the diﬀerence in strain values . First 10 minutes , tissue experienced very signiﬁcant strain values whereas after 20 minutes , it recovers and shows wild type strain values . In ﬁrst 0 - 5 minutes strain 69 proﬁle , tug - of - a - war eﬀect can be seen . Cell uses tug - of - war mechanism [ 133 ] to transmit the forces in long ranges when moving together . The ﬁrst 5 minutes interval showed the highest positive strain ( blue ) in the center of the left - over EL and the highest negative strain ( red ) at the edges . Especially the edge that neighboring cells removed experienced the highest negative strain because of the initial contraction . This data indicated that healing of the EL on the ML is composed of four phases . In the ﬁrst phase , the remaining EL recoils and retracts . This ﬁrst simultaneous response of removal of neighboring cells occurs within few minutes . The second phase is where remaining tissue stabilizes itself . Depending on the left over EL area size , the healing speed changes the more area etched the faster to heal . In the third phase , healing starts , and the EL starts to spread over ML . At this phase ML contracts and keep retracting until EL covers ML completely . Starting speed at this phase is the fastest known cell speed alive . At this phase , cells show a peak velocity . The fourth phase is restoration , where EL resumes back to its normal speed and after EL completely covers ML , AC tissue starts to spread normally . Figure 4 . 16 : Strain proﬁle changes in re - epithelization of half - epithelial - removed tissue . These results support the hypothesis of mechanical coupling between cell layers to en - sure eﬃcient collective rearrangement . Epithelial layer migration rate goes up to 1500um 70 per hour , which seems impossible without mesenchymal layer contribution . Mesenchymal cells contraction seems to be accelerating the epithelial layer healing response . Mesenchy - mal cells might be using " conveyer belt " type of behavior to help epithelial layer to cover mesenchymal layer . Using this method , I created a 3D platform within a multilayer system to study diﬀerent cell types’ responses to bio - etching which was similar to a wound - healing response . Bio - etching technique will reveal useful information about collective behavior dur - ing development , wound healing and tumor growth . Furthermore , this assay might elucidate mechanisms used by both epithelial and mesenchymal cells to coordinate their movements during morphogenesis . The ability to control the form of multicellular tissues potentially will have high impact in tissue engineering and regeneration applications in bioengineering and medicine . Likewise , my custom microﬂuidic system can be conﬁgured to test a range of hypotheses concerning the control and regulation of development and cell diﬀerentia - tion with additional applications in tissue engineering . The ability to investigate complex developmental systems will provide great opportunities for increasing the understanding multicellular interactions in more evolving spatiotemporal environments than in vitro cell monolayer studies . The ability to control the chemical environments and then monitor the overall response of these systems such as AC explants provides a way to study complex and emergent behaviors in time and space . My integrated system combining long - term and high - speed dynamic pressure and ﬂow control with microﬂuidics will be useful to investigate the dynamics of embryonic development at a molecular , cellular , and tissue levels with high spatial and temporal resolution . I believe this technique will enable development biologists to utilize spatiotemporal stimulation of growth factors ( e . g . FGF or Activin ) to stimulate speciﬁc sections of a tissue and potentially drive the development toward non - regular , but favorable phenotypes . This approach also can be extended to study other areas in devel - opmental biology including cell motility , intercalation , and diﬀerentiation toward dictating overall explant system - wide responses . This work will be of interest to researchers in areas including developmental biology , engineering , physics , and chemistry . 71 Chapter 5 Conclusion 5 . 1 Conclusion I have developed a novel microﬂuidic technique that demonstrated the ability to create and shape 3D tissues with subtractive manufacturing " bio - etching " . While many approaches use 2D environments with monolayers , my unique microﬂuidic technique provided the ability to control the 3D environment and study the interactions of individual epithelial and mes - enchymal layers . I used the animal cap ectoderm of the Xenopus laevis embryo as a model system for the study of tissue bio - etching since these tissues are multi - layered with both an epithelial and a mesenchymal layer , and are well suited to real - time analysis . My method introduced a new chemical bio - etching method with a precise spatial and temporal control of the etched area . This precise positioning allowed me to construct novel epithelial and mesenchymal tissue architectures . I was able to remove single cell layers or multiple layers with tremendous precision allowing me to shape 3D tissues . Integration of methods for controlling cells within a bioengineering breadboard helped me pursue extremely challenging goals to generate and pattern at the ﬁne scale distinct cell and tissue types ( e . g . muscle versus bone ) ; the breadboard combined microﬂuidic control with 72 cellular engineering to control a subset of morphogenetic machines . Using spatiotemporally controlled microﬂuidic streams I was able to study multi - layer coordination of epithelial and mesenchymal cell layers and acute mechanical and behavioral response of intact epithelial and mesenchymal cell sheets to removal of neighboring or overlying tissues . Using bio - etching technique , I tested the hypothesis mesenchymal and epithelial layer are mechanically coupled . I showed that epithelial layer provides cues to coordinate collective migration in deep mesenchymal cells . In addition , mesenchymal cell layer helped epithelial layer reepithelialized by contracting until the epithelial layer completely covers . As result , epithelial layer migration rate goes up to 1500um per hour which is impossible without mes - enchymal layer contribution . Epithelial sheet migration over mesenchymal cells exposed by etching is two - fold faster than the fastest migratory cell suggesting they might be mechan - ically coupled . Healing of epithelial layer ( EL ) on mesenchymal layer ( ML ) was composed of four phases . In ﬁrst phase , remaining EL recoiled and retracted . This ﬁrst simultaneous response of removal of neighboring cells occurred within few minutes . Second phase is where remaining tissue stabilized itself . Depending on the left over EL area , the healing speed changed with the more area etched the faster to heal . At third phase , healing started and EL started to spread over ML . At this phase ML contracted and keep retracting until EL covered ML completely . Starting speed at this phase is the fastest known cell speed alive . At this phase , cells showed a peak velocity . Fourth phase was restoration where EL restored back to its normal speed and after EL completely covered ML , AC tissue started to spread as normal . The explant recovered without a scar . With the bio - etching technique , one can precisely manipulate distinct spatial regions of a single cell by delivering diﬀerent ﬂuids to diﬀerent subcellular domains . This approach extends our ability to control chemical stimulation in biological systems beyond only 2D . I applied detergent to the epithelial layer of the Xenopus but only over one - half of the explant . To create a single layer of cells over half of the explant . I then captured images of cell migration occurring over time . I speciﬁcally focused on the cell migration in the top 73 layer , as the epithelial cells moved to heal through collective migration over the mesenchymal cell layer . By plotting the distance with respect to time , it was possible to examine the velocity of the cell movement at diﬀerent locations along the length of the AC . Repeating the experiments and delivering the detergent at diﬀerent locations , control the amount of the left - over epithelial cells . For example , delivering the detergent to the apical side where the stream covers most of the AC ( e . g . 75 % of the surface ) , caused most of the AC becomes only the mesenchymal cell layer . I plotted the recovery time and collective cell migration speed of the epithelial cell layer for diﬀerent amounts of detergent subtraction of epithelial cell layers . I might need to look at the mesenchymal cell layer more in depth for a journal publication . Using confocal microscopy , I can reveal the mechanism in the deep cell layer . Using mechanical coupling inhibitors like heptagonal or Y - compounds I can test further my hypothesis about layers being coupled . 5 . 2 Future work 5 . 2 . 1 Creating Embryonic Bridges Using 3D Microﬂudics Long - term studies of localized responses of cells and tissues to chemical stimuli are critical in numerous areas including developmental biology . Recent advances in development and stem cell biology have identiﬁed signaling and gene regulatory networks that control cell - identity and tissue assembly . However , these studies are all conducted en - mass , providing population - level analyses of the processes controlling identities . Missing from these studies are details of cell - level changes in cell identity and subsequent cell movements and rearrange - ments that accompany these changes . It is these processes that direct cells into their proper location within forming organs and prevent cells from adopting invasive pre - cancerous be - haviors . To understand these events we need quantitative information on the life - history of stem cell - like embryonic cells as they receive chemical stimuli from their microenviron - 74 ment , change gene expression , adopt new cell behaviors , and assemble into tissues from a mechanics point of view . Furthermore , the ability to have spatiotemporal control extends researchers capabilities and enables the more sophisticated control needed to produce organs ex vivo , which is especially poignant in wound healing . One area of wound healing is par - ticularly important when understanding 3D tissues . The coordinated responses of diﬀerent cells types in developed tissues have been shown to have important geometrical constraints on collective cell migration . The collective behavior of the diﬀerent cells has shown to create unique migration patterns that are directly related to wound healing . One response that has recently gained much attention is cellular bridging ( Figure 5 . 1 ) . Cellular bridging in - volves that ability of single cells and cell clusters to spatially span distances such as epithelia bridging [ 14 ] , cytonemes [ 134 ] , and tunneling nanotubes [ 135 ] . The recent work in epithe - lial bridging has been shown to be related to the mechanics of the system through tension with actomyosin contractility as well as being related to mechanically governed structures including actin bundles , adhesion sites of adherent junctions . Since the embryonic tissue is much more three - dimensional than single monolayers of cells that are essentially ﬂat on the bottom of the microﬂuidic channel , dynamic control of 3D chemical patterns with both high precision and high speed is critical here . The lack of techniques to provide inputs and mea - sure biological responses with suﬃcient temporal and spatial resolution has hampered the advance of quantitative approaches to understanding development and tissue engineering . To observe both high - speed and protracted tissue and cellular responses , 3D experimental apparatus is needed . The ability of cells to sense and respond to mechanical cues is critical to their func - tion within complex 3D microenvironments . While single cell studies are commonly used to investigate these abilities , extending these studies to naturally occurring integrated 3D multi - cellular tissues would provide tremendous advances in understanding mechanobiology responses . Model tissues such as those found in the developing frog Xenopus laevis are nat - urally three - dimensional and also allow for detailed cellular and molecular responses to be 75 Figure 5 . 1 : Monolayer keratinocytes migrating on microcontact - printed ﬁbronectin patterns form multicellular suspended epithelial bridges [ 14 ] . assessed . These model tissues also are extremely important in exploring the mechanics of collective migration , which is important in wound healing . The ability to develop novel tech - nologies for these model tissues is challenging though . Microfabrication technologies allow the development of tools to control and assay spatiotemporal responses of cellular systems . Here , I developed new 3D fabrication approaches for understanding the role of mechanics in terms of collective migration and cellular bridging , which will have implications in a diversity of ﬁelds including mechanotransduction . To understand the mechanics of collective migra - tion , I developed a 3D microﬂuidic system , which will allow both mechanical stimulation and shaping of the Xenopus animal cap . The principles of collective migration exposed with these tools will lead to greater insights into tissue scale processes such as wound healing , tissue remodeling , and regeneration . To probe the role of controlled chemical stimuli in diﬀerentiation and patterning of cell behaviors within vertebrate embryonic tissue in 3D , I built a microﬂuidic system capable of providing precise 3D spatial and temporal chemical stimuli to cultured tissues over long time 76 frames and dynamically control the apical and basal chemical environment while guiding the assembly of tissue functional units . This 3D microﬂuidics system is capable of manipulating streams in complex patterns in the main chamber , but also to capable of independently ma - nipulating streams beneath the tissue nearer to the mesenchymal cell adhesion complexes . Using 3D streams and complex 3D tissues , one can generate complex chemical and archi - tectural microenvironments with the goal of controlling the tissue mechanics , cell motility , and wound healing . This study oﬀers tissue formation and remodeling in a vertebrate devel - opmental model system to advance areas including engineering tissues , stem cell response , and developing new targets for diseases . This approach allows to detect spatiotemporal dynamic responses of apical and basal regions of living embryonic tissues . We can investi - gate : ( 1 ) distinct cytoskeletal dynamics in diﬀerent chemical conditions of apical and basal parts of embryonic cells such as dynamics of F - actin ( e . g . polymerization and depolymer - ization ) when embryonic cells migrate during development ; ( 2 ) membrane receptor based growth factor induced multicellular dynamics ; and ( 3 ) induction of localized diﬀerentiation of the progenitors in Animal Cap tissue explants during living Xenopus laevis embryonic development 5 . 2 . 1 . 1 Transition from 2D to 3D - Molding of Microﬂuidic Devices Animals are complex , dynamic , multicellular systems responsive to an set of physical and chemical inputs . At an early stage in development , cells and tissues receive spatiotemporal stimulation from a variety of inputs . One of the most important stimuli is the chemi - cal environment , which profoundly inﬂuences developmental progression . Developing and implementing a system that can be integrated with developing multicellular systems and dy - namically control their 3D chemical environment to guide the assembly of tissue functional units is essential to understand complex cellular systems . Microﬂuidics has mainly been used in 2D systems such as laminar ﬂow separation . Con - sidering tissues and organs are three - dimensional , two - dimensional ( 2D ) approaches may re - 77 spond diﬀerently than those in more physiologically relevant 3D environments [ 72 , 116 – 118 ] . Traditional 2D cell culture studies lack important features necessary to accurately replicate cell function and formation . There is wide range of tools available to fabricate layers , molds or whole microﬂuidics devices including photolithography , solid object printing , mechanical or laser machining [ 136 ] . Thus , a number of 3D microﬂuidics approaches have been pre - viously implemented including layered fabrication , direct 3D fabrication , and 3D molding . For example , Jo et al . fabricated 3D microchannels in PDMS by stacking 2D layers [ 137 ] . Also , Whitesides’ group showed that with right aspect ratio , laminar ﬂow in multi - layered 3D microstructures was achievable ( Figure 5 . 2 ) [ 15 ] . 5 . 2 . 2 Layered fabrication Three dimensional microﬂuidic channel fabrication can be achieved by layered fabrication where two or more 2D microﬂuidic channel layers are bonded to together to form 3D channel as shown in Figure ( 5 . 2 ) . Individual layer can be fabricated through any preferred method and they can be stacked with on top of each other with precise alignment . This method provides the ﬂexibility of 3D topography whereas time requirement for alignment and the determining the sturdy bonding are the two biggest pitfalls . Depending on the material used , there are option for bonding the layer . Traditional bonding techniques includes the use of glue which has the potential to clog the small feature channels , and also the ability to modify the surface chemistry with plasma cleaning which might not be ideal for some materials . However , in microﬂuidics PDMS is mainly used and with oxygen plasma cleaning , baked PDMS surface can be modiﬁed to make it bond covalently . 5 . 2 . 3 Direct 3D printing When alignment and bonding are an issue , monolithic 3D printing is one the options . 3D printing might be subtractive like micro - machining or additive manufacturing like stere - 78 olithography or solid object printing . There are many machines that are capable of man - ufacturing with resolutions down to few microns even in nanometers . In stereolithography , photosensitive material is solidiﬁed with UV in an additive manufacturing manner . Though , automation of this technique to have mass production is costly . 5 . 2 . 4 3D molding 3D molding is similar to 3D printing . The diﬀerence is that mold replicates the negative of the structure and using other materials microﬂuidic channel can be fabricated from the mold . In this method , there is no material restriction like in stereolithography , many materials can be used to fabricate the mold but the channel device material must compatible with mold material . Micro machining is one of the most desirable technique to fabricate 3D molding because of its advantages in high resolution . Although , solid object printing using 3D printers seems to be the most attractive one because of it accessibility , roughness on the surface and poor resolutions do not make it best candidate for small dimension microﬂuidic channel fabrication . Comparing these methods , layered fabrication is the most suitable technique to fabricate 3D microﬂuidic channels to study cellular mechanisms . To house a tissue or a cell in a microﬂuidic channel , the bottom of the channels needs to be coated with an ECM - like ﬁbronectin , which is to what substrate cells adhere . Since multiple channels are needed per day for cellular experiments , other methods become incompatible because of the need of mass production . Shortly after , combination of 3D microﬂuidics with cell biology was studied by fabricating a layered 3D microﬂuidic channel with a single cell housed in main channel where apical and basal surface of the cell together stimulated [ 16 ] . Previously , our group was able to demonstrate 3D microstructures with pressure driven laminar ﬂow are great tool to study cell behaviors . In previous work , our group has focused on independently controlling the apical 79 Figure 5 . 2 : Pressure - Driven Laminar Flow in Tangential Microchannels a ) Schematic drawing of the tangential microchannels fabrication . b ) Two - stream laminar ﬂow at Re = 10 with diﬀerent aspect ratios . A = h / w [ 15 ] . and basal environments in single living cells through vertical aqueous - phase separation under laminar ﬂow ( Figure 5 . 3 ) . Using the ability to control the ﬂow - rate within the two distinct layers of microchannels , simultaneous apical and basal stimulation was applied . Now my goal is to implement previous work to tissue level . I developed a new technique of high - precision 3 - D diﬀerential apical basal microﬂuidics for probing long - term embryonic development that allows precise control of diﬀerential api - 80 Figure 5 . 3 : Schematic image of the apical - to - basal microﬂuidic device . [ 16 ] . cal and basal chemical stimulation and assaying . This contribution is signiﬁcant because it enables 3D control and assaying of spatiotemporal cues over large tissues or over en - tire organisms . I constructed this new microﬂuidic system based on a previously constructed multi - layered microﬂuidic platform that had two independent microﬂuidic channels vertically aligned above each other and I could deliver vertically separated chemicals in solution . I ﬁrst constructed this multi - layered microﬂuidic platform with two independent sets of channels . The design has the upper layer of the microﬂuidic systems having one large main chamber with inlet channels for both the apical and basal layers and with the lower layer having mul - tiple narrow channels . I fabricated these two separate microﬂuidic slabs using conventional soft lithography and they were combined together to form one integrated device . This device has the characteristics of : ( 1 ) a multi - inlet PDMS slab for the apical stimulation with chan - nels that are 0 . 3 mm tall and 1 . 5 mm wide for the embryonic tissue explants ; ( 2 ) one PDMS slab with multiple narrow lanes that are 10 µ m tall and 5 µ m wide separated by 2 µ m ( for a width of 55 µ m wide there are 6 narrow channels ) . I then vertically aligned and adhered these two slabs with the channels on the upper and lower slabs placed in directions running 81 Figure 5 . 4 : 3D apical - basal Xenopus stimulation approach through multilayered microﬂu - idics . The narrow channels are to a ) Top and bottom channel dimensions b ) Schematic of 3D microﬂuidic channel with embryonic AC tissue housed in . The Xenopus tissue will be positioned in the main channel where its apical side can be stimulated fully or in local do - mains . The entire basal domain or local subregions can be stimulated through the multiple small channels running beneath the spread embryo . c ) Two steps apical and basal chemical stimulations . Lower narrow channels are not drawn to scale to enhance visualization . perpendicular to each other ( Figure 5 . 4 ) . Since ﬂows from the upper and lower channels of the two - layer microﬂuidic platform intersect each other in the middle of downstream although it is laminar , it is diﬃcult to 82 Figure 5 . 5 : Confocal images of 3D microﬂuidic channel . Due to high resistance in narrow channel and lower resistance in the top channel , ﬂuids get mixed at the intersection . regulate each ﬂow precisely because of the sensitivity of the ﬂow caused by the large diﬀerence in sizes of the two channels . The challenge here is both channels have to have exactly the same pressure to be able to maintain laminar ﬂow . In particular , an increase of the ﬂow rate in the lower channel causes the ﬂow to be mixed at the intersection and move to the upper channel outlet because the ﬂuidic resistance in the lower channel is relatively very high ( Figure 5 . 5 ) . Since bottom narrow channel is so narrow compared to main channel that hydraulic resistance is higher which causes a low ﬂow rate . Predicting ﬂow patterns and determinig the exploitable range of ﬂow rates is possible via computation ﬂow analysis . Also , the lower channel size should be optimized to avoid a couple of unnecessary experimental 83 variations that might aﬀect on the result such as tissue attachment variation due to shear ﬂow underneath the tissue . 3D channel has been fabricated but still needs development to improve laminar ﬂow and interface control in the channel . After characterization of the channel , I will grow Xenopus animal cap tissue in 3D channel . I do not anticipate any issue with this since AC tissues are shown to grow on posts . This is still on going part of the work . 5 . 2 . 5 Studying Tissue Integrity During Collective Migration Using 3D Microﬂuidics My long term goal is to understand integrated mechanochemical responses of complex 3D tissues through novel 3D microﬂuidic approaches . I ﬁrst want to approach this through " subtractive manufacturing " which I was able to do with the Xenopus animal cap and the ability to control the application of the etching chemicals using bio - etching . Before , I demonstrated that simultaneous control of the subcellular environment at both domains can be achieved with diﬀerent chemical agents . Next , I will implement similar detergent extraction over the epithelial cell layer , but before the migration occurs , I will deliver a stream perpendicularly to the bottom mesenchymal cell layer from the lower layer of the 3D microﬂuidics . I will apply inhibitors of the mechanical connections such as blebbistatin , Y27632 etc . to examine the bridging response of the epithelial cells when local mechanical connections are inhibited in the mesenchymal layer . I will then track the collective migration as previously described in terms of motility and speed of motility . I will use as a control the delivery of the same inhibitors over the entire tissue and track the motility and speed of motility . I also will vary the concentration of the inhibitors to investigate the eﬀects of amount of inhibition linked to the collective motility . This approach will allow me to elicit the eﬀect of local tracks of mechanically inhibited mesenchymal cells , which adjacent mesenchymal cells are mechanically intact . Questions about the collective migration of the cells near and away from the area of local inhibition relative to the epithelial cell migration 84 will elucidate mechanical connectivity questions . In addition , instead of using mechanical inhibitors , I will use chemical inhibitors such as hepthanol , which is a gap junction inhibitor . This approach will allow me to investigate chemical versus mechanical connections and how these bridges are linked to collective cell migration from a mechanochemical standpoint . I expect that the cell motility of the epithelial cells is inhibited in the areas above the local application of the inhibitor on the mesenchymal cells due to the mechanical connections being disrupted ( Figure 5 . 6 ) . I expect that the further away from the locally inhibited cells , the epithelial cells will collectively migrate at speeds approaching those of the uninhibited collective migration . One potential limitation may be in the visualization of the individual cells using stereomicroscopy as imaging their characteristics such as their podia extensions could provide additional insight . If this is a limitation , I will express live cell reporters such as plasma membrane targeted mCherry , histone labeled mPlum , and the actomyosin reporter utrophin - GFP and use real time confocal microscopy to reveal ﬁne scale cellular responses to micro - environmental features and regulated levels of contractility . Once the Xenopus embryonic tissues is positioned , apical side of the tissue faces the main channel with the basal surface directly above the narrow lower channels . The narrow chan - nels enable a support of the tissue for attachment and spreading - tissue will spread over rather than penetrating into the channels , but also allow ﬂow to pass beneath the embryo to stimulate its basal domains ( Figure 5 . 4b ) . The top channel is a T - shaped channel and consist of three inlets and one outlet . Bottom channel has 5mm long six straight channels ( 5 µ m width and 10 µ m height with 5 µ m spacing ) and is bonded perpendicular to T - shaped channel’s outlet ( width 1500 µ m ) ( Figure 5 . 4a ) . These multiple narrow channels in the bot - tom layer then provide access for stably controlled localized chemical patterns to the tissues . In addition , these channels are 10 microns tall so that high - resolution imaging can be accom - plished . These two channels were bonded to each other by using plasma cleaning technique . I anticipate that the Xenopus ACs easily cover the intersection of the apical and basal stimu - lation networks in the 3D microﬂuidic system ( Figure 5 . 4b ) . It is important to note that the 85 Figure 5 . 6 : Schematic of apical and basal chemical stimulations response . Lower narrow channels are not drawn to scale to enhance visualization . stimulation of the basal surface is really distributing a signal to the interstitial media that bathes the basolateral surfaces of cells ( Figure 5 . 6 ) . For example , the use of microﬂuidics to deliver chemicals to the apical surface of epithelial cells does not modify their interstitial microenvironment yet our " basal " delivery has the ability to accomplish just that , which is unexampled before . Thus , this design is capable of stimulating the basal and apical part of the animal cap tissue of Xenopus embryonic tissue simultaneously with diﬀerent chemical reagent . 86 The cells of Xenopus embryonic animal cap share many features with mammalian embry - onic stem cells , and may provide insights into stem cell response in the future studies . This will advance the ﬁeld by developing a diﬀerential apical basal stimulation system and using a control - feedback approach to building a microﬂuidics device to probe and then control long term stimulation and response of 3D embryonic tissues by integrating these tools with synthetic cell biology approaches drawn for developmental biology studies . This project will be transformative by providing a unique apical - basal and controls - based approach to probe the role of spatiotemporal stimuli in 3D multi - cellular development as cells use ma - ternal pre - patterning , gene regulatory networks , and input from external stimulus to guide development of future tissue replacements . Furthermore , our developed approaches will be extremely important in wound healing and could be extended to other medically important areas such as tumor biology . This contribution is signiﬁcant because it enables 3D control and assaying of spatiotemporal cues over large tissues or over entire organisms . This ability will aﬀect their single cell response toward physiologically functional tissues , and also may serve as a potential targets for therapeutic intervention as well as furthering tissue engineer - ing and regenerative medicine . This project both develops new approaches for controlling 3D tissues and investigates important scientiﬁc questions involving wound healing . This project is transformative through understanding the basis of cell mechanical responses in 3D tissues , which is relevant to a number of physiological conditions , but is not conven - tionally explored in mechanotransduction . While investigating single cell migration is more commonly studied , the ability to exercise 3D control over cells that are integrated within a naturally occurring complex 3D embryonic tissue will enable a range of new experiments to shed light on mechanotransduction and cell interactions within complex physiologically relevant tissues . Unlike conventional decellularization approaches , this technique leaves re - maining tissues viable . Thus , this 3D tissue - etching assay will be useful in the future to study mechanical responses , collective cell sheet migration , and explore processes that coor - dinate composite tissues movements during morphogenesis . The ability to control the form 87 of multicellular 3D tissues will have high impact in the allied ﬁelds of tissue engineering and regeneration medicine and provide insights into cancer and stem cell biology . This project will produce important ﬁndings in diverse areas including mechanics , engineering , biology , and biophysics , and will advance ﬁelds such as mechanotransduction , biotechnology , and cell migration . 88 Bibliography [ 1 ] R .
