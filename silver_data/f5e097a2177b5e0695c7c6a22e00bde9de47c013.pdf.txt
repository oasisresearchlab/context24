The ARCADIA trial investigated the safety and efﬁcacy of AZD1656 in diabetic patients admit - ted to hospital with COVID - 19 . Methods The ARCADIA trial was a Phase II randomised , double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trial . Adult dia - betic patients , admitted with COVID - 19 , were recruited at 28 hospitals in the UK , Romania and Czech Republic and randomly assigned ( 1 : 1 ) to receive AZD1656 tablets ( 100mg twice a day ) , or matched placebo , for up to 21 days , in addition to usual care . All involved were masked to treatment allocation . The primary endpoint was clinical improve - ment measured at Day 14 . The Full Analysis Set ( FAS ) included all patients who received at least one dose of assigned treatment . ARCADIA is complete and registered with ClinicalTrials . gov ( NCT04516759 ) . Findings Between 29 September 2020 to 16 April 2021 , 170 patients were screened and 156 patients were rando - mised , three of whom did not commence treatment . Of the remaining 153 , 80 were assigned to AZD1656 and 73 were assigned to placebo and included in the Full Analysis Set ( FAS ) . The primary analysis showed no statistically signiﬁcant difference between groups ( AZD1656 : 76 ¢ 3 % ; Placebo : 69 ¢ 9 % , p = 0 ¢ 19 ) . There was no difference in the number of adverse events between groups ( AZD1656 : 35 ¢ 7 % ; Placebo : 33 ¢ 3 % ) . Mortality was lower in the AZD1656 group compared to the placebo group ( AZD1656 : four ( 5 % ) ; Placebo : nine ( 12 ¢ 3 % ) , p = 0 ¢ 090 ) ) . At Day 7 there were zero deaths in the AZD1656 group compared to six deaths in the placebo group ( p = 0 ¢ 011 , post hoc ) . A difference between groups in time to hospital discharge was also seen ( p = 0 ¢ 16 ) . Immunophenotyping data suggested that AZD1656 - treated patients had a less pro - inﬂammatory immune response and a better adaptive immune response than those treated with placebo . Interpretation Although the trial did not achieve its primary endpoint , AZD1656 was associated with a decrease in deaths and a reduction in the duration of hospitalisation , as compared to Placebo . Immunophenotyping and immu - nochemistry indicated an immunomodulatory effect of AZD1656 . The trial suggests a beneﬁcial therapeutic effect of AZD1656 and identiﬁes a new therapeutic concept : small molecule activation of endogenous homeostatic immune cells which themselves become the therapeutic agent within the body . Phase 2 trials of this size carry the risk of false positive results and conﬁrmation of these results in a larger clinical trial is now required .

Migration of Tregs to sites of in ﬂ ammation was known to be essential for their homeostatic function , a process which requires the activation of glycolysis by the enzyme glu - cokinase ( also known as Hexokinase IV ) . AZD1656 ( a speci ﬁ c glucokinase activator ) had shown short - term ef ﬁ cacy in reducing blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes and reduced the risk of skin transplant rejection in AZD1656 - fed rodents , but its immune effects in humans and potential to treat COVID - 19 humans was unknown . Added value of this study This study increases our understanding of COVID - 19 and in particular the immune system response to COVID - 19 , by examining both immunochemistry and immunophenotyping data in diabetic patients hospital - ised with this disease . The study increases our under - standing of the drug AZD1656 and speci ﬁ cally , its potential to treat COVID - 19 and / or other illnesses where an aberrant or unwanted T - cell mediated immune response is involved in the pathophysiology of the disease . Implications of all the available evidence Although the trial did not achieve its primary endpoint , AZD1656 was associated with a reduction in mortality ( p = 0 . 090 ) and a reduction in hospitalization time ( p = 0 . 16 ) in people with diabetes admitted to hospital with COVID - 19 . AZD1656 appeared to induce a measur - able immunomodulatory effect , consistent with an active rebalancing of the immune response , which could explain the improved clinical outcomes seen in AZD1656 - treated patients . AZD1656 may bene ﬁ t patients with other conditions where an inappropriate T - cell mediated immune response is involved , including respiratory viral infections , organ transplant rejection and those with T - cell mediated auto - immune conditions . Introduction SARs - COV - 2 induces an excessive proinﬂammatory response in severely ill patients , resulting in high con - centrations of pro - inﬂammatory cytokines and suppres - sion of anti - inﬂammatory Regulatory T ( Treg ) cells , leading to a poor prognosis from COVID - 19 . 1 , 2 Both type 1 ( T1DM ) and type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) con - fer an increased risk of mortality 3 ; moreover , poor gly - caemic control ( as deﬁned by an elevated HbA1c level ) is an independent predictor of increased mortality in the disease . 4 It was hypothesised that AZD1656 ( a glucokinase activator ) could be used as an immune regulatory medi - cine to beneﬁt diabetic patients with COVID - 19 by both immunomodulation and by controlling the abnormal glucose variability observed in this disease . AZD1656 had been investigated in 25 prior clinical trials as part of AstraZeneca’s Type 2 diabetes develop - ment program , with over 960 patients exposed to AZD1656 ( for up to 6 months treatment duration ) . It was well - tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes and reduced blood glucose but only for 3 - 4 months , thus limiting its long - term use for patients with diabetes . 5 , 6 In vitro studies demonstrated that migration of regu - latory T cells ( Tregs ) to inﬂamed tissue is crucial for their immune - modulatory function ; a process that is regulated by glucokinase - dependent glycolysis . 7 The speciﬁc dependence of Treg migration on glucokinase - mediated glycolysis had been demonstrated in humans where Tregs , but not conventional T cells , from carriers of a loss of function gene polymorphism in GCK regula - tory protein ( GKRP ) displayed enhanced motility ex vivo . Carriers of the polymorphism displayed decreased circulating Tregs suggesting increased localisation in tissues . Furthermore , in - vivo studies using Tregs as an interventional treatment through adoptive transfer have shown beneﬁt in an acute lung injury model through mediating the resolution of lung injury . 8 Glycolysis also plays an important role in the function of pro - inﬂamma - tory T effector cells ( Teffs ) , however Teffs migrate via activation of Hexokinase I ( HKI ) , but not glucokinase ( HKIV ) . AZD1656 is a speciﬁc activator of glucokinase with > 100 - fold effect compared to HKI and would therefore be expected to enhance selectively Treg cell migration . 9 Uncontrolled ( or unwanted ) innate and adaptive immune responses might therefore be controlled with a glucokinase activator ( such as AZD1656 ) by speciﬁcally Articles 2 www . thelancet . com Vol 00 Month , 2022 enhancing the migration of Treg cells to inﬂammatory sites , thereby reducing inﬂammation and helping to restore immune homeostasis . In COVID - 19 , an effec - tive treatment of this type could eliminate the most damaging effects of the disease , leading to reduced car - diorespiratory complications resulting in decreased hos - pitalization times and reduced mortality . The aim of this trial was to investigate the use of AZD1656 in the treatment of patients with diabetes hos - pitalised with COVID - 19 . The primary objective of the study assessed clinical outcome at Day 14 , using the WHO 8 - point Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement ( OSCI ) rating system . The secondary objectives focussed on mortality , duration of hospitalisation , glycaemic con - trol , and safety . The exploratory objectives included an assessment of the immunological effects of the drug . Methods Study Design The ARCADIA Trial was a double - blind , randomised , placebo - controlled , clinical trial to evaluate AZD1656 in the treatment of diabetic patients hospitalised with COVID - 19 . The trial was conducted at 28 hospitals in the UK , Romania and the Czech Republic . The trial was sponsored by the charity St George Street Capital . It was performed in accordance with the principles of the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clin - ical Practice guidelines and approved by the UK Medi - cines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency . Ethical approval was obtained from the East Midlands - Leicester South Ethics Committee ( REC 20 / EM / 0198 ) in the UK , from the National Bioethics Committee of Medicines and Medical Devices in Bucharest , Romania , and from the Multicentre Ethics Committee of the Insti - tute of Clinical and Experimental Medicine and Thomayer’s Hospital in Prague , the Czech Republic . The full protocol and statistical analysis plan are pub - licly available on ClinicalTrials . gov ( NCT04516759 ) . Participants Patients were eligible if they had either type 1 or type 2 diabetes and had been hospitalised with suspected or conﬁrmed COVID - 19 and a blood glucose level at or above 4 mmol / L . Local investigators recruited partici - pants admitted to their hospital . 156 patients aged 18 or older took part in the trial . Written informed consent was obtained from all patients . Randomisation and masking Eligible patients were randomly assigned ( 1 : 1 ) to either the AZD1656 ( plus usual care ) group or to the placebo ( plus usual care ) group . Randomisation was performed by the investigators using a centralized computer - based randomisation system . Treating staff , patients and study team were blinded to the treatment intervention . Randomisation blocks were prepared by a statistician not involved in the trial using SAS software . Matching active and placebo tablets were packaged in identical bottles ( distinguishable only by a unique bottle number ) in order to achieve blinding . Procedures AZD1656 or placebo tablets were taken orally , twice per day , at approximately the same time each day with or just after meals . 50mg ﬁlm - coated tablets of AZD1656 ( or matching placebo ) were dosed at 100mg BID ( a total daily dose of 200 mg ) . Patients received study treatment for up to a maximum of 21 days , or until date of dis - charge from hospital , or date of transfer to mechanical respiratory ventilation or date of death . The day on which the patient discontinued study drug was deﬁned as Study Drug Discontinuation ( SDD ) . Therefore , SDD could occur at any timepoint between Day 2 and Day 21 . Patients also received standard of care for COVID - 19 , which was determined at an individual site and patient level . All treatments were recorded as concomitant med - ications . Patients were assessed daily to capture their WHO OSCI status . Safety assessments included daily monitoring for adverse events , clinical laboratory testing and daily vital signs measurements . Analysis of NT - proBNP and hsTroponin ( hs - CTNT ) was performed at screening and the ﬁnal study visit to determine the extent of cardiac injury in patients receiving AZD1656 versus placebo . A ﬁnal visit took place 7 days after com - pletion of study treatment to capture any new safety information or changes to concomitant medication . Immunophenotyping and immunochemistry panels were conducted to explore the effect of AZD1656 on speciﬁc immune characteristics . Immunophenotyping was conducted by Flow Cytometry : between group com - parison ( AZD1656 versus placebo ) of levels of T , B and NK cells including speciﬁc Treg and memory T cell pop - ulations . ( See Supplementary Material for a summary of the immunophenotyping methodology . ) Immunophe - notyping was performed at Queen Mary University of London ( QMUL ) , UK . Immunochemistry was con - ducted using the MSD U - Plex multiplex assay for assessment of the following biomarkers : G - CSF , GM - CSF , IL - 1B , IL - 4 , IL - 6 , IL - 8 , IL - 10 , IL - 12 , and MIP - 1a . PK analysis and immunochemistry were performed at York Bioanalytical Solutions , UK . Clinical data were captured in an electronic Case Report Form ( Medidata RAVE ) . The trial was monitored by a Clinical Research Organi - sation ( Clinipace Inc ) . The Chief Investigator was Dr Kieran McCafferty , Barts Health NHS Trust , UK . Outcomes The primary outcome was Clinical Improvement assessed centrally as the percentage of subjects who Articles www . thelancet . com Vol 00 Month , 2022 3 were ‘responders’ ( patients with WHO OSCI score 1 , 2 or 3 at Day 14 ) , comparing AZD1656 treatment to pla - cebo . To check the robustness of the primary efﬁcacy analysis ( which focussed on a single timepoint ) , a longi - tudinal analysis based on the WHO OSCI path from Day 1 to Day 14 was also conducted . 10 To explore if sub - groups affected clinical outcome , the primary efﬁcacy analysis on clinical improvement was repeated for sub - groups of the following variables : Vitamin D group , Race , Sex . Age group , Diabetes type and Site . Secondary and safety outcome measures included clinical improve - ment ( measured as the proportion of patients in each WHO OSCI category at day 7 , 14 and 21 post randomisa - tion ) ; degree of glycaemic control ; time from admission to hospital discharge ; all - cause mortality ( Day 28 ) , time from admission to mechanical respiratory ventilation , proportion of serious adverse events and proportion of treatment emergent adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation . Predetermined exploratory com - parisons of immunophenotyping and immunochemis - try parameters over time were made for each treatment group with the baseline values for that patient subset , for changes from baseline within each group and between groups at each timepoint . Levels of 25 - hydroxy - vitamin D levels were measured before treatment to compare to clinical outcomes . Post hoc analyses were performed to examine the trial data in light of the improvements in standard of care and resultant patient outcomes that evolved during the pandemic . Time to hospital discharge became a clin - ically important measure for health utilisation assess - ment and several post hoc analyses were performed on this endpoint . The following subgroups of patients were analysed based upon the assumption that certain risk factors could affect COVID - 19 outcome : those with high baseline IL - 6 ( ≥ 13 pg / mL ) , baseline Vitamin D status ( < 25 nmol / L and ≥ 25nmol / L ) , dexamethasone use , BMI values ( ≥ 35 mg / m 2 ) , and baseline Treg levels ( < 10 ¢ 5 % or ≥ 10 ¢ 5 % ) . The day 7 ( 168 hour ) timepoint was identiﬁed a priori in the protocol as a secondary endpoint measure for efﬁcacy . It was therefore selected as a suitable timepoint for post hoc analysis of both mortality rate and hospital discharge rate . Mortality was also assessed at study treatment discontinuation ( up to Day 21 ) . A post hoc analysis was performed for patients with T2DM taking insulin on hospital admission to determine if there was an increase in insulin require - ments during the study . A logistic regression analysis of clinical improvement was also performed post hoc to determine whether any demographic factors or sub - groups could be attributed as causal for clinical improvement . Statistical analysis The trial was designed to include 150 randomly assigned patients to AZD1656 or placebo for an estimated total of 75 evaluable patients per group . A two group x 2 test with a 5 % two - sided signiﬁcance level would have 76 ¢ 74 % power to detect the difference between a placebo proportion of 0 ¢ 6 and an AZD1656 proportion of 0 ¢ 8 when the sample size is 150 ( 75 / group ) . The Full Analysis Set ( FAS ) or intention - to - treat population included all 153 randomised patients who received at least one dose of assigned treatment . The primary efﬁcacy analysis was performed on the FAS . To check the robustness of the primary efﬁcacy analysis which focussed on a single timepoint ( Day 14 ) , a longi - tudinal analysis based on the WHO OSCI path from Day 1 to Day 14 was conducted . whereby the completed WHO OSCI paths of patients were converted into a sin - gle number ( Worth parameter ) via pair comparisons on a daily basis using a Bradley - Terry model . 10 In order to assess clinical improvement using different assump - tions from those in the FAS analysis , the primary efﬁ - cacy analysis was also performed using the per protocol ( PP ) set . Clinical improvement was compared between both treatment groups using a logistic regression with the canonical logit - link . The primary endpoint and all laboratory results were tested on the two - sided signiﬁ - cance level of 5 . 0 % . All other results were tested on the one - sided signiﬁcance level of 2 . 5 % . An ANOVA was performed on multiple factors including treatment group , sex , age group , race , diabetes type , vitamin D group , and site to conﬁrm the result of the primary efﬁ - cacy analysis and to explore the impact of the other fac - tors . The secondary efﬁcacy analyses were performed on the FAS and displayed descriptively . Time from hos - pital admission to hospital discharge ( in hours ) and time to death in patients receiving AZD1656 compared with placebo was analysed with Kaplan − Meier esti - mates . All safety endpoints were analysed by descriptive statistics on the Safety Analysis Set ( SAF ) . Statistical analyses were done using SAS software , version 9 ¢ 4 . A Safety Review Committee ( SRC ) consisting of clinical and other experts was established by the Sponsor to review safety ﬁndings during the study and to help ensure patient safety . The trial is registered with Clini - calTrials . gov ( NCT04516759 ) where the full Statistical Analysis Plan can be viewed .

Results Between 29 September 2020 to 16 April 2021 , 170 patients were screened and 156 of these were rando - mised across 3 European countries ( UK : 74 patients ; Czech Republic : 49 patients ; Romania : 33 patients ) . 7 patients who were randomised with suspected Articles 4 www . thelancet . com Vol 00 Month , 2022 COVID - 19 did not subsequently test positive via PCR and remained in the trial , as allowed per protocol . Of the 156 randomised patients , 153 were treated with AZD1656 ( 80 patients ) or placebo ( 73 patients ) and included in the Full Analysis Set ( FAS ) ( Figure 1 ) . Male and female patients aged 18 years and older with T1DM or T2DM , who were hospitalised with suspected or con - ﬁrmed COVID - 19 categorised as stage 3 , 4 or 5 on the WHO OSCI and who were not expected to progress to intubation or mechanical ventilation within the next 24 hours , were included . Almost all patients completed treatment according to the protocol ( AZD1656 : 98 ¢ 8 % ; Placebo : 97 ¢ 3 % ) . All had blood glucose levels > 8 ¢ 5 mmol / L at enrolment ( Table 1 ) . The mean age was similar between groups ( AZD1656 : 63 ¢ 6 years ; Placebo : 65 ¢ 0 years ) and the ratio of men to women was approximately 2 : 1 . Most patients were white ( AZD1656 : 85 ¢ 0 % ; Placebo : 90 ¢ 4 % ) . Mean duration of treatment ( not shown ) was simi - lar in both groups ( AZD1656 : 7 ¢ 1 days ; Placebo : 7 ¢ 6 days ) . The proportion of patients receiving prior medica - tions ( i . e . , stopped before study medication was started ) was similar between groups for all medications ( AZD1656 : 61 ¢ 3 % ; Placebo : 60 ¢ 3 % ) . The most fre - quently reported prior medications were biguanides ( AZD1656 : 20 ¢ 0 % ; Placebo : 16 ¢ 4 % ) . In accordance with the inclusion criteria for the study , suspected or conﬁrmed COVID - 19 and T1DM or T2DM were reported for all patients . Most patients had Figure 1 . Trial pro ﬁ le . 170 patients consented and were screened for study eligibility . 156 eligible patients were subsequently randomised ( UK : 74 patients ; Czech Republic : 49 patients ; Romania : 33 patients ) . 153 of the randomised patients received at least one dose of either AZD1656 or placebo and were included in the Full Analysis Set ( FAS ) ( the Intent - to - Treat population ) . The FAS included 80 patients in the AZD1656 group and 73 patients in the Placebo group . Articles www . thelancet . com Vol 00 Month , 2022 5 T2DM ( 150 / 153 ) with only three patients with T1DM . Of the concomitant medical conditions considered to be risk factors for COVID - 19 ( Table 2 ) , obesity was the most frequently reported ( AZD1656 : 26 ¢ 3 % ; Pla - cebo : 34 ¢ 2 % ) followed by asthma ( AZD1656 : 12 ¢ 5 % ; Placebo : 12 ¢ 3 % ) and COPD ( AZD1656 : 5 ¢ 0 % ; Pla - cebo : 11 ¢ 0 % ) . Key efﬁcacy outcomes are summarised in Table 3 . The primary analysis of clinical improvement , deﬁned as the number of patients who were “responders” ( with a WHO score or 1 , 2 or 3 ) at Day 14 , showed no statisti - cally signiﬁcant difference between groups ( AZD1656 : 76 ¢ 3 % ; Placebo : 69 ¢ 9 % ; p = 0 ¢ 19 ; RR 1 ¢ 09 ( 95 % CI 0 ¢ 67 - 2 ¢ 90 ) ) . A pre - planned longitudinal analysis showed that AZD1656 performed approximately twice as well as Pla - cebo according to the mean Worth parameter values ( AZD1656 : 14 ¢ 8 ; Placebo : 28 ¢ 5 ; p = 0 ¢ 038 ) . In a secondary endpoint analysis of clinical improvement at Day 7 , 44 / 80 ( 55 % ) of AZD1656 patients were responders , com - pared to 34 / 73 ( 47 % ) of placebo patients ( p = 0 ¢ 079 ) . The mortality rate at the end of the study ( Day 28 ) revealed that there were fewer deaths in the AZD1656 group compared to the Placebo group ( AZD1656 ; four ( 5 % ) : Placebo ; nine ( 12 ¢ 3 % ) ; p = 0 ¢ 090 ) . There was no difference between groups in the pro - portion of patients ultimately being discharged from hospital ( AZD1656 : 80 ¢ 0 % ; Placebo : 79 ¢ 5 % ) . Kaplan - Meier estimates for time to hospital discharge showed that the ‘probability of staying in hospital’ curve remained higher in the placebo group than in the AZD1656 group from approximately Day 7 onwards ( p = 0 ¢ 16 ) ( Figure 2 ) .

However , consistent with the expected effect of AZD1656 , a higher proportion of patients receiving AZD1656 than placebo had glucose levels below Lower Limit of Normal ( LLN ) during the study ( AZD1656 : 23 ¢ 8 % ; Placebo : 5 ¢ 5 % ; p = 0 ¢ 0013 ) ( not shown ) . There were no differences in the proportion of patients who received intubation or mechanical ventilation with three occurring in each group ( AZD1656 : 3 ¢ 8 % ; Pla - cebo : 4 ¢ 1 % ; p = 0 ¢ 61 ) . Subgroup analyses of clinical improvement at Day 14 indicated a difference between groups in favour of AZD1656 in male patients ( OR 1 ¢ 78 ; 95 % CI 0 ¢ 72 - 4 ¢ 4 ) , patients aged ≥ 65 to < 85 years ( OR 1 ¢ 58 ; 95 % CI 0 ¢ 62 - 4 ¢ 07 ) , and patients with low ( < 25 mmol / L ) baseline Vitamin D levels ( OR 3 ¢ 06 ; 95 % CI 0 ¢ 89 - 10 ¢ 52 ) ( Figure 3 ) . All patients received at least one concomitant medi - cation during the study and the proportion of patients receiving concomitant medications was similar between groups ( see Supplementary Material ) . The most fre - quently reported concomitant medications were gluco - corticoids , with dexamethasone taken by almost three quarters of all patients AZD1656 : 71 ¢ 3 % ; Placebo : 75 ¢ 3 % ) . Some patients were also treated with IL inhibitors which included tocilizumab ( AZD1656 : 3 ¢ 8 % ; Placebo : 4 ¢ 1 % ) , anakinra ( AZD1656 : 1 ¢ 3 % ; Placebo : none ) , and sarilumab ( AZD1656 : 1 ¢ 3 % ; Placebo : none ) . Key safety outcomes are summarised in Tables 4 and 5 . Adverse events ( AEs ) were reported by a similar pro - portion of patients between groups ( AZD1656 : 35 ¢ 7 % ; Placebo : 33 ¢ 3 % ) . A lower proportion of patients in AZD1656 than Placebo reported serious adverse events ( AZD1656 : 4 ¢ 8 % ; Placebo : 10 ¢ 1 % ) . None of the serious AEs were judged to be related to study treatment . The incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation from study drug was similar in the 2 groups ( AZD1656 : 2 ¢ 4 % ; Placebo : 2 ¢ 9 % ) . There was a higher incidence of hypoglycaemia TEAEs in patients receiving AZD1656 , all of which were judged as either mild or moderate in severity .

Differences were observed in the cells involved in the antibody response : Th2 cells decreased in the Placebo group at SDD ( p = 0 ¢ 035 ) , leading to a difference between groups at SDD ( p = 0 ¢ 038 ) . B cells also decreased in the placebo group and increased in the AZD1656 group leading to a differ - ence between groups at SDD ( p = 0 ¢ 045 ) . There was a decrease in levels of Tregs cMet + ( activated Tregs ) by Day 11 in both groups and a difference between groups at this timepoint ( p = 0 ¢ 054 ) . For resting Tregs ( those not in the activated state ) , levels were steady in the Placebo group and fell slightly with AZD1656 treatment with no difference between groups at any timepoint . Post hoc analyses of variables that emerged as impor - tant as the pandemic developed generated clinically meaningful ﬁndings which need to be tested in a larger trial . An assessment of time from randomisation to death showed that patients in the Placebo group died earlier in the course of their hospitalisation than those in the AZD1656 group ( p = 0 ¢ 074 ) ( Figure 4 ) . By Day 7 ( a pre - determined timepoint for efﬁcacy ) there had been six deaths in the Placebo group but none in the AZD1656 group ( p = 0 ¢ 011 , RR 0 ¢ 08 ( 0 ¢ 00 , 1 ¢ 33 ) ) ( Table 3 ) . By the time of study treatment discontinua - tion ( up to Day 21 ) the mortality rate was still lower in the AZD1656 group compared to placebo ( AZD1656 ; one ( 1 ¢ 3 % ) : Placebo : six ( 8 ¢ 2 % ) ( p = 0 ¢ 045 , RR 0 ¢ 15 ( 0 ¢ 00 , 1 ¢ 23 ) . Post hoc analysis of ' time to hospital discharge’ showed that the proportion of patients being discharged within 7 days ( 168 hours ) was higher in the AZD1656 group than the Placebo group ( 37 ¢ 5 % vs 24 ¢ 7 % ) ( p > 0 ¢ 062 , RR 1 ¢ 52 ( 0 ¢ 93 , 2 ¢ 48 ) ) . Kaplan Meier estimates of ' time to hospital discharge’ detected differences between treatment groups in certain high risk sub - groups . In patients with low baseline Vitamin D levels ( < 25 nmol / L ) , the ‘probability of staying in hospital’ Kaplan Meier curve was higher in the Placebo group than the AZD1656 group ( p = 0 ¢ 052 ) ( Supplementary Material ) . In patients with high baseline IL - 6 values ( ≥ 13 pg / mL ) , the ‘probability of staying in hospital’ Kaplan Meier curve was also higher in the Placebo group compared to the AZD1656 group ( p = 0 ¢ 021 ) ( Figure 5 ) and the mean hospitalization time was 3 days less in the AZD1656 group than in the Placebo group ( p = 0 ¢ 056 ) . Dexamethasone use , high BMI , or baseline Treg levels did not affected the probability of patients staying in hospital . A post hoc analysis was performed for patients with T2DM taking insulin on hospital admission to deter - mine if there was an increase in insulin requirements during the study . Results showed that there were no dif - ferences between groups . A logistic regression analysis of the baseline factors treatment , sex , age group , race , diabetes type , Vitamin D group and site was conducted post hoc to determine whether any demographic factors or subgroups could be attributed as causal for clinical improvement and this showed no difference between groups . Figure 4 . Time from randomisation to Death - showing deaths only - post hoc ( analysis set : FAS ) . More patients died in the Placebo group than in the AZD1656 group ( Placebo : 9 AZD1656 : 4 ) and they did so earlier in the course of their hospitalization than those in the AZD1656 group ( p - value = 0 ¢ 074 ) . Only patients who died are presented in this plot . All patients , with and without an event ( death ) , were used in the log - rank test . Articles 10 www . thelancet . com Vol 00 Month , 2022 Discussion The trial recruited the planned number of patients and randomisation achieved a well - matched population both demographically and for severity of disease . It was nota - ble that only three patients had T1DM and 150 had T2DM . The study did not achieve its primary endpoint , for reasons that will be discussed , however , an associa - tion between AZD1656 treatment and clinical outcome , including reduced mortality , was discovered . The differences between groups in clinical outcomes supported the trial hypothesis that AZD1656 might be of beneﬁt to patients with diabetes admitted to hospital with COVID - 19 . The study protocol noted that improved clinical outcomes could be achieved via two potential mechanisms of action : by improved glycaemic control and by modulation of the immune response through enhanced migration of Treg cells . Since no differences in glycaemic control were detected between groups , it is unlikely that the differences in outcomes were a result of the glucose lowering effect of AZD1656 . The immu - nology data however suggested that AZD1656 induced a measurable , immunomodulatory effect , consistent with an active rebalancing of the immune response , which supported the trial hypothesis and could explain the differences in clinical outcomes observed in this trial . Our understanding of COVID - 19 , its immunopathol - ogy and consequent management of the disease has evolved signiﬁcantly since this trial began in 2020 . Early evidence of adaptive immune dysfunction was derived from autopsy reports of patients with COVID - 19 with low numbers of CD8 - positive T lymphocytes inﬁltrating lung tissue . 13 We now know that mecha - nisms driving T cell activation and differentiation become dysregulated in severe COVID - 19 , leading to unfocused T - cell responses which can paralyze the T - cell system preventing appropriate resolution of inﬂammation following infection . 14 The ARCADIA trial has generated the ﬁrst clinical evidence of glucokinase - activated immunomodulation being associated with a reversal of COVID - induced ‘immune - paralysis’ and a restoration of the adaptive immune response . The ARCADIA trial was designed before there were approved therapies for COVID - 19 . Dexamethasone was subsequently approved and almost three quarters of all study patients in both groups were treated with dexa - methasone . Importantly , the differences between groups in both clinical outcomes and immunological measures were additive to the effects of dexamethasone . Evidence from published data shows that higher Vitamin D levels are not only associated with better COVID - 19 outcomes , 15 , 16 but also with higher Treg / total T cell ratios and a more immunosuppressive phenotype . 17 , 18 In this trial , low baseline Vitamin D lev - els were associated with longer hospitalisation time in the placebo group but not in the AZD1656 group . In those who received AZD1656 , mean hospitalisation time was similar in patients with high and low vitamin D , which may reﬂect a decreased need to use vitamin D by inﬂammatory cells in the patients treated with Figure 5 . Time from randomisation to hospital discharge , subgroup : Patients with baseline IL6 > = 13 pg / mL - post hoc ( Analysis Set : FAS ) Patients with baseline IL - 6 values ≥ 13 pg / mL had a lower probability of staying in hospital in the AZD1656 group than in the Placebo group ( p - value = 0 ¢ 021 ) . In this sub - group , the mean hospitalization time was approximately 3 days shorter in the AZD1656 group than the Placebo group ( AZD1656 : 191 hours ; Placebo : 271 hours ( p = 0 ¢ 056 ) . Articles www . thelancet . com Vol 00 Month , 2022 11 AZD1656 . A difference was also observed between clini - cal outcomes and baseline IL - 6 levels . Despite being in a higher risk group for a poor outcome from COVID - 19 , 19 , 20 patients with a high baseline IL - 6 ( ≥ 13 pg / mL ) treated with AZD1656 were discharged alive and well from hospital faster than those treated with placebo . Both vitamin D levels and IL - 6 levels may be markers to aid stratiﬁcation of patients in future trials . Immunophenotyping was consistent with AZD1656 playing a role in actively changing the immune response by moderating innate immunity , promoting the activation of an adaptive Th1 response and by main - tenance of appropriate Th2 and B cell responses ( Figure 6 ) . A moderation of innate immunity was also observed in the immunochemistry data where a differ - ence between groups in the pro - inﬂammatory cytokine MIP1 a following treatment was seen . A reduction in activated Treg ( cMet + ) levels was seen at Day 11 only . Given that , at any time the Treg and Treg cMet + count in the blood is the product of a dynamic equilibrium between cell production and cell use , the ﬁnding of a change in Treg ( cMet + ) at Day 11 might indicate a spe - ciﬁc change in that equilibrium warranting further investigation . A key strength of the trial was the simplicity of the study design , which allowed all new COVID - 19 treat - ments to be given as they emerged during the pan - demic . This encouraged a high level of engagement with investigators and patients and allowed the genera - tion of data from normal clinical practice . Care was taken from the outset to design a trial which involved few interventions beyond those required for usual care , to minimize inconvenience to patients and to minimize additional burden to the investigators . As a result , we achieved our enrolment target with good patient reten - tion and procedural study compliance throughout . A further strength of the trial was the use of electronic data capture which helped protocol compliance and team communication . A key challenge was to design a clinical trial in a new disease that had not yet been characterised . This affected the choice and timing of the primary endpoint measure ( clinical improvement as measured using the WHO OSCI rating system at Day 14 ) and the statistical power calculation , all of which were decided when there were no approved therapies for COVID - 19 . ( It is worth noting that this issue applies to all trials designed in such circumstances and should encourage re - evaluation of the importance of post hoc analyses in clinical trials of emerging diseases ) . The prognosis for diabetic patients hospitalised with COVID - 19 improved signiﬁ - cantly through 2020 resulting in the majority of study patients being discharged from hospital prior to Day 14 in both groups . Whereas at the earlier Day 7 time - point ( identiﬁed a priori as a secondary endpoint measure for efﬁcacy ) , the proportion of discharged patients was higher in the AZD1656 group than the Placebo group ( by a ratio of 2 : 1 ) and there had been no deaths in the AZD1656 group compared to six in the placebo group . It is of pharmacological interest and potential clinical signiﬁcance that the apparent therapeutic effect was achieved early in dosing , given that the mean duration of treatment was just over 7 days for all patients . Figure 6 . Immune effects of AZD1656 observed in the ARCADIA trial . Articles 12 www . thelancet . com Vol 00 Month , 2022 There have been signiﬁcant advances in the develop - ment of therapeutic agents for COVID - 19 , but limita - tions continue to exist with currently approved therapies . Antiviral agents must be administered early in the infection , they can encourage viral mutation and use tends to be limited by toxicity . Monoclonal antibod - ies face logistical challenges and can be rendered inef - fective by the emergence of new variants . We propose that AZD1656 would be an advance over other available therapeutics for COVID - 19 if the results generated here are replicated in a larger conﬁrmatory clinical trial . AZD1656 is a therapeutic intended speciﬁcally to treat the cellular disease itself caused by the virus , indepen - dent of any viral mutations which may occur . Whilst the risk of false positives in a phase II trial exists , the ARCADIA trial data suggest that speciﬁc met - abolic activation of Tregs brings about changes in the immune system which are associated with early clinical improvement in patients suffering inﬂammatory dis - ease caused by a virus . Furthermore , the evidence pre - sented here suggests that speciﬁc activation of Tregs might suppress the inappropriate inﬂammation which is the prime cause of tissue damage in autoimmune dis - ease . If this is conﬁrmed , further research into the pos - sibility that cell activation may persist beyond the effect of the interaction of the small molecule and its intracel - lular molecular target would be warranted . The ARCADIA trial has produced a new therapeutic concept : speciﬁc cell activation by a small molecule whereby the activated cell itself becomes the therapeutic agent within the body ( “in vivo activated - cell therapy” ) . Although there have been some exceptions using embryonic cells , 21 therapeutic cell therapy has , on the whole , failed . 22 , 23 This is probably because until now in most cell therapy approaches cells have been removed from the body , processed and then reinjected ; or cells have been cultured or engineered out of the body and then injected ; rather than by therapeutic activation of the cell within its natural environment , as might be achieved with AZD1656 . Furthermore , small molecule activators of Tregs could be used as pharmacological probes to reveal the role of Treg behaviour in conditions where cellular inﬂammation causes disease . These may be as diverse as the myocardial effects of ischaemia , pre - mature labour , asthma , type 1 diabetes or sepsis . 24 − 28 Although the trial was designed to address COVID - 19 , these ﬁndings might have wide implications for the development of new therapeutics across a spectrum of immune and other diseases and underscore the need for continued basic and clinical research in this area .
