They are beyond the scale of individual nodes but more local than , for example , communities . When statistically over - or under - represented , they are called network motifs . Network motifs have been interpreted as building blocks that shape the dynamic behaviour of networks . It is this promise of potentially explaining emergent properties of complex systems with relatively simple structures that led to an interest in network motifs in an ever - growing number of studies and across disciplines . Here , we discuss artefacts in the analysis of network motifs aris - ing from discrepancies between the network under investigation and the pool of random graphs serving as a null model . Our aim was to provide a clear and accessible catalogue of such incongruities and their effect on the motif signature . As a case study , we explore the metabolic network of Escherichia coli and show that only by excluding ever more artefacts from the motif signature a strong and plausible correlation with the essentiality proﬁle of metabolic reactions emerges . 1 . INTRODUCTION Analysing few - node subgraphs and network motifs has become an indispensable tool for understanding complex networks . Network motifs , the statistical over - or under - representations of few - node subgraphs , give insights into network organization beyond the trivial scale of individual nodes and links . Any study that employs the perspective of network motifs to relate the function to the topology of a network must have strong evidence for the following : ( i ) the sub - graph composition is non - random ( compared with a suitable pool of reference graphs , i . e . to a ‘null model’ ) and ( ii ) the motifs can be related to function , i . e . over - represented subgraphs can be assigned plausible functional roles and / or under - represented subgraphs can be argued to be detrimental to the functioning of the system . The general concept has been introduced and devel - oped by the Alon and co - workers [ 1 , 2 ] , particularly for transcriptional regulatory networks [ 3 , 4 ] . Ever since the early studies of network motifs , it was clear that other mesoscopic or macroscopic network properties can affect the perceived motif signature . In particular , the randomiz - ation procedure has drawn signiﬁcant criticism [ 5 – 10 ] . Some examples of topological properties considered here that affect the motif signature are : ( i ) modularity [ 11 – 14 ] and ( ii ) hierarchical structures [ 15 – 19 ] . Others include : ( i ) the degree distribution ( reviewed in Newman [ 20 ] ) and ( ii ) degree correlations [ 21 , 22 ] . The crosstalk between global and local network prop - erties and their effect on network motifs was assessed in recent studies [ 6 , 23 , 24 ] . The effect on motif signatures was formally explored for scale - free and hierarchical graphs [ 24 ] , and the crosstalk between two graph proper - ties ( assortativity and clustering coefﬁcient ) was studied in detail with the help of a biased random walk in the ensemble of all graphs with ﬁxed degree sequence [ 25 ] . Even if the topological analysis is beyond any doubt , the functional relevance of motifs for biological networks has been called into question [ 5 , 7 , 26 ] . The work by Ginoza & Mugler [ 8 ] has put forward a local argument for motif correlations induced by a prop - erty of the randomization scheme . While this argument ( in the form given by Ginoza & Mugler [ 8 ] ) is true only for graphs without bidirectional links ( and therefore a reduced motif inventory ) and for small densities ( as otherwise a wider range of randomization steps will be available ) , the argument neverthelessshowsthepossibility of subtle intrinsic correlations inﬂuencing the result of a motif analysis . In Avetisov et al . [ 27 ] , an algorithm for con - structing modular hierarchical graphs is described . The authors , in particular , observe that their constructed graphs have a non - random motif composition , resembling one of the superfamilies from [ 2 ] . * Author for correspondence ( christoph . fretter @ gmx . de ) .

The func - tional relevance of motifs will be investigated by combining them with dynamical data . Our running example is the metabolic network of Escherichia coli ; yet , in parallel , we also illustrate some of these problems with random graphs . We show that the successive removal of artefacts strongly mod - iﬁes the motif signature . Using ﬂux - balance analysis ( FBA ) [ 28 ] , a standard method for predicting metabolic ﬂux patterns and biomass production , we then show that the corrected motif signatures become functionally ever more plausible . The organization of the text is as follows : a short over - view on motifs , together with the methods employed here and the network representation of metabolism , is given in § 2 ; a number of effects of network architecture on motif content are discussed in § 3 ; issues in mapping ( dynami - cal ) data onto motifs are the focus of § 4 ; and in § 5 , the implications of our results for the analysis of complex net - works , in general , are described , as well as some aspects of further work . 2 . METHODS 2 . 1 . Terminology and software packages Throughout this paper , we discuss induced subgraphs , as they constitute the objects of interest in the vast lit - erature on network motifs . By induced , we mean that for each pair of nodes of the subgraph , there is a ( directed ) link if and only if the same link appears in the original graph . The general idea of a motif analysis is to compare few - node subgraph counts obtained from a real net - work with the corresponding counts obtained from randomized versions . In the case of three - node sub - graphs , the corresponding Z - scores can be summarized in a triad signiﬁcance proﬁle ( TSP ) showing the statis - tical over - or under - representation of each of the subgraphs . The Z - score for subgraph m is deﬁned as Z m ¼ ð c m (cid:2) m m Þ = s m , where c m is the count of subgraph m in the original network , m m is the expectation value of c m in the random networks and s m is the standard deviation of c m in the random networks . A typical randomization scheme preserves the number of incoming , outgoing and bidirectional links at each node . The most prominent example is switch randomization , where iteratively endpoints of randomly selected links are swapped ( ensuring that bidirectional and unidirectional links are randomized independently and that no parallel links are produced in this way ) . The exact procedure of randomizing a graph while retaining the degree sequence of the graph has been debated both in ﬁelds of application [ 29 ] and in more mathematical communities [ 30 – 33 ] . Apart from pure convergence issues of the iterative randomization pro - cess , the individual randomization step is of interest . In particular , one can accompany the decision by sub - sidiary conditions ( e . g . enhancing positive or negative degree correlations or , alternatively , retaining global network features such as modularity or the diameter ) . However , such subsidiary conditions increase the risk of sampling the null model search space non - uniformly . There are two sorting schemes for subgraph types in the literature . We will employ the one from Milo et al . [ 1 ] , where subgraphs are grouped according to criteria ( cyclic versus acyclic ; then connectivity or number of bidirectional links ) , rather than the one , where three - node subgraphs are sorted according to their ‘identiﬁer’ ( the adjacency matrix of the subgraph , read as a binary number [ 34 ] ) . In all ﬁgures showing a TSP , we will also indicate this subgraph identiﬁer underneath the corresponding subgraph pictogram . The most important software packages for a motif analysis are mﬁnder , the software used in the original works on motifs [ 1 ] , and FANMOD [ 35 ] . MAVisto [ 36 ] additionally has the ability to highlight motifs in labelled networks . Motif ﬁnding has also been implemented for the Pajek network analysis software [ 37 ] . In the following , we will show the impact of several large - scale topological properties on the TSP . To this end , we construct random graphs with prescribed large - scale properties and evaluate the subgraph composition . The random graphs are directed Erdo´´s – Re´nyi ( ER ) graphs generated with an additional parameter p b that regulates the number of bidirectional links . The other parameter is the usual link probability p . In some places , we will analyse a ‘randomization error’ , the sum over the squares of Z - scores over all subgraphs . Given that for purely random graphs , the ‘correct’ TSP must be zero for all subgraphs ; this randomization error thus measures the deviation from the correct TSP . When appropriate , we also show analytical predic - tions of the artefactual TSP . In these cases , we employ the formalism developed in Fretter et al . [ 38 ] . 2 . 2 . Network representations of metabolic systems Metabolic networks are a condensed , abstract represen - tation of the production and distribution of metabolic compounds ( metabolites ) by all biochemical reactions that can occur in an organism owing to the catalytic action of enzymes . Metabolites and reactions belong to distinct sets of nodes . The only possible connections are links between these two categories and not within , thus forming a bipartite network . More involved represen - tations of metabolism exist , for example , including enzymes as another category of nodes [ 39 ] , or choosing a hyper - graph structure to represent reaction – compound relations [ 40 ] , but these representations are inaccessible to a wide range of current graph - analytical tools . The topology of metabolic networks is organized in a complicated way . The degree distribution of metabolites is typically scale - free , the whole architecture modular and layered . Ignoring any hierarchy of functional modules , the uptake reactions , reactions contributing to biomass generation and all the reactions in - between result in a layered organization of metabolism . These complica - tions present a formidable challenge in any attempt to explore the interrelations between network topology and dynamical function for metabolic systems [ 41 , 42 ] . Artefacts in network motif analyses M . E . Beber et al . 3427 J . R . Soc . Interface ( 2012 ) Because most formalisms developed to analyse net - works have been focused on general graphs where all nodes belong to the same mode or category , and arbi - trary links are possible , henceforth called unipartite graphs or networks , metabolic networks are customarily projected onto either one of the two sets of nodes and the projected unipartite network is then analysed . In the majority , these analyses considered metabolism as an undirected network ( see earlier studies [ 39 , 43 , 44 ] and for a critique of the projection of metabolic networks , see recent studies [ 41 , 45 ] ) . A method for the projection of directed metabolic net - works was presented [ 46 ] . We retain that method for projecting the metabolic network onto its metabolite - centric representation , i . e . connecting each substrate with each product of a certain reaction and introducing a bidirectional link if the reaction is reversible ( see the scheme in ﬁgure 1 ) . For a directed representation of the reaction - centric network , we draw a link between two reaction nodes if there is a directed path of length two from a source reaction R i , through exactly one metabolite C k , to another reaction R j = i . The link is drawn in the direction of the existing path ( as depicted in ﬁgure 2 ) . Studying few - node subgraph compositions of metabolic networks suffers from several issues . First , few - node subgraphs are typically deﬁned for unipartite graphs . Second , the choice of an appropriate null model is unclear . In the ﬁrst publication of TSPs for metabolic networks [ 46 ] , the metabolite - centric representations were treated as any other graph , and standard switch randomization was applied , thus ignoring , among others , effects caused by the projection process itself . Attempts to deﬁne more realistic null models for meta - bolic systems need to focus on two aspects : ( i ) incorporating topological constraints such as the bipartite nature of the graph , adequate treatment of reversible reac - tions and modularity ; ( ii ) incorporating functional constraints ( such as mass balance [ 47 ] or other stoichio - metric constraints [ 48 ] ) , ensuring that , in principle , the randomized graph could be a fully functional metabolism . In this paper , we will pursue the ﬁrst aspect . Eom et al . [ 46 ] have also neglected an important bio - logical point when dealing with metabolic network structures . When we think of the metabolic capabilities of an organism , what we have in mind are the pathway maps that detail the procession of biochemical reactions required to transform a substrate taken up from the environment to a ﬁnal product that is useful to the organ - ism . In order to preserve this pathway structure , Ma & Zeng [ 49 ] suggested the removal of all currency metab - olites from the network , i . e . all those compounds that provide energy or balance charges , or chemical groups among the main metabolites under transformation . In our opinion , such a step is necessary to reveal those struc - tures otherwise dominated by the connections formed by these currency metabolites to almost all other reaction nodes in the network . In this study , we highlight the various results that stem from considering such technical - ities and the topology - based constraints on metabolic null models . In the following , we use a set of metabolic networks from 43 different organisms that were collected from the WIT database 1 and published in recent studies [ 43 , 46 ] . They are available online as bipartite graphs . 2 Our main object of study is then a metabolic net - work representation of E . coli compiled from the cytosolic components of the genome - scale metabolic model iAF1260 [ 50 ] that was manually curated such that connections to currency metabolites were removed , except in cases where these metabolites are the main reactants as , for example , in ATP synthesis [ 51 ] . In addition , the functional subsystem categories included in Feist et al . [ 50 ] , i . e . core , amino acid , lipid , nucleotide or unspeciﬁc metabolism were used for the module - aware randomization described later on .

E . Beber et al . J . R . Soc . Interface ( 2012 ) 3 . FINDING MOTIFS IN METABOLIC TOPOLOGIES The starting point for our work is the TSP published in Eom et al . [ 46 ] , which we recomputed from the original networks and show in ﬁgure 3 in the subgraph ordering used in Milo et al . [ 1 ] . Most noteworthy about this result is the rather small overall magnitude of the stan - dard deviation and the surprisingly small variation of the standard deviation across the triads . Of course , these are the means over - normalized Z - scores ; yet their triad composition appears remarkably similar for networks of vastly different sizes . There are several problems attached to this database of 43 networks used , for example , in recent studies [ 43 , 46 ] and for computing the TSPs shown in ﬁgure 3 . They are given as bipartite networks but compounds and reactions are identiﬁed only by indices , and so we lack any chemical information about them . Second , and related to the ﬁrst issue , the networks still contain cur - rency metabolites . Third , the links between compounds and reactions carry no additional information . It is there - fore impossible to determine substrates and products for reversible reactions from the network . Why all of these points matter will be shown in the following . 3 . 1 . Currency metabolites From this point forward , we use the metabolic network of E . coli as described in § 2 . 2 . and previously used in Sonnenschein et al . [ 51 ] . We compare its TSP employ - ing different null models with the network used in Eom et al . [ 46 ] . In ﬁgure 4 , the curve labelled as ‘unipar - tite’ shows the TSP of the curated E . coli metabolic network after projecting it onto the compound nodes and using simple switch randomization as a null model . Over - or under - representations of triads are particu - larly informative when related to the dynamical function of the system . Depending on the type of dynamic data available either the metabolite - centric or the reaction - centric , metabolic network represen - tation and its motif signature may be the appropriate topological information . To the best of our knowledge for the ﬁrst time , we show the TSP of the reaction - centric network of E . coli in ﬁgure 5 . The curve labelled as ‘unipartite’ deviates extremely from the used null model . Most strikingly , the TSP separates clearly into two categories . The ﬁrst six triads ( the chain - like sub - graphs ) are all extremely under - represented , whereas the latter seven triads ( triangular subgraphs ) are mostly over - represented . Notably , although magnitudes differ , this is also the case for the metabolite - centric network ( ﬁgure 4 ) . The extreme values of the Z - scores seen in electronic supplementary material , ﬁgure S6 indicate an ill - formed null model . 3 . 2 . Categorizing bidirectional links We will now include two more pieces of biochemical information that require us to return to the bipartite network representation of metabolism . First of all , there is mounting evidence that projecting a bipartite graph onto either set of nodes affects a number of topo - logical quantities . In the case of clustering , this has been remarked for metabolism in Monta nez et al . [ 45 ] and discussed on a more general level in Latapy et al . [ 52 ] . The simplest way of incorporating all those effects into the null model is to perform switch randomization on the level of the bipartite graph . We can then com - pare statistics of the projected metabolic network with projections of the randomized bipartite counterparts . 6 36 12 74 14 78 38 98 108 46 102 110 238 – 0 . 4 – 0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 no r m a li ze d Z - s c o r e Figure 3 .

A comparison of the TSP of the metabolite - centric projection of the metabolic network from [ 46 ] , labelled ‘orig - inal’ , with the TSPs of the manually curated metabolic network [ 51 ] using three different null models that are labelled ‘unipartite’ , ‘bipartite’ and ‘modular’ . The curve labelled ‘uni - partite’ stems from a switch randomization of the network after it has been projected onto its metabolite nodes . The ‘bipartite’ curve denotes that the randomized networks were generated on the level of the bipartite network , treating reversible reactions separately and then counting three - node subgraphs in the metabolite - centric projections . The ‘modular’ curve combines the ‘bipartite’ switch randomization with bio - logical modules . The raw Z - scores can be seen in electronic supplementary material , ﬁgure S5 .

Beber et al . 3429 J . R . Soc . Interface ( 2012 ) Switch randomization on the level of the bipartite graph allows us to address another issue that has received little attention , namely bidirectional links . Typically , the number of bidirectional links is conserved in switch randomization , the argument being that they are a unique property of the network and not just the co - occurrence of two unidirectional links . It should be noted that in real networks , both types of bidirectional links can occur , in principle . It is plausible , for example , to assume that in gene regulatory networks a bidirec - tional link is rather the co - occurrence of two unidirectional links , while in metabolic networks revers - ible reactions certainly constitute an example of true bidirectionality as an individual category . In metab - olism we also ﬁnd , however , the case of two distinct enzymes being responsible for the two opposing direc - tions of converting two compounds and , hence , the other interpretation of bidirectional links . Does the distinction between the two types of bidir - ectional links and the related distinction between the two interpretations of the classical randomization scheme affect the observed motif signature ? In order to motivate this general point , we show the impact of bidirectional links on the TSP of ER graphs ( ﬁgure 6 , also see electronic supplementary material , § S3 for more in - depth information ) . Returning to metabolic networks , the curves labelled ‘bipartite’ in ﬁgures 4 and 5 result from switch ran - domization on the level of the bipartite graph and a subsequent projection onto the respective set of nodes . Reversible reactions were treated separately from the others , but the co - occurrence of reactions performing opposing conversions of compounds is not an issue in the bipartite graph . 3 . 3 . Modularity One key observation about biological networks is their organization in modules ( communities ) that was related to their function and robustness . It was shown [ 53 – 55 ] that metabolism is not an exception . We will now use the insights into modules and their effect on Z - scores described in the electronic supplementary material , § S1 . 1 to show and explain the effects of modules on the TSP of graphs in general . We assemble a graph from four dense modules , where each module is a directed ER graph . Additionally , a few inter - module links are introduced . As the graphs for each module as well as the inter - module links are constructed in a motif - blind way , correct randomization should yield a ﬂat TSP , with all individual Z - scores being close to zero . The result of applying standard switch randomiz - ation can be seen in ﬁgure 8 . We also show the result of a modularity - aware randomization scheme that mixes intra - module links and inter - module links separately . In real - world networks , the modular structure is generally not known , and thus the quality of this modularity - aware randomization scheme will depend on the quality of the module - detection algorithm employed . In order to better understand the error made by a randomization scheme without any module information , we will perform an analytical calculation that yields a prediction of the error signature . To obtain predictions for the artefactual TSP arising from switch randomization , we use the simplemodeloffew - node subgraphsfrom Fretter etal . [ 38 ] . It is essential to note that , when the modules are destroyed , the effective local intra - module density of the network is reduced by a factor of the number of modules . This is because compared with a network with N nodes and M links a network of twice the size with N * = 2 N nodes and M * = 2 M links has a density of d (cid:3) ¼ M (cid:3) = N (cid:3) ð N (cid:3) (cid:2) 1 Þ (cid:4) d = 2 . 6 36 12 74 14 78 38 98 108 46 102 110 238 no r m a li ze d Z - s c o r e – 0 . 4 – 0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 Figure 5 . A comparison of the TSP of the reaction - centric pro - jection of the metabolic network from [ 46 ] , labelled ‘original’ ( solid line ) , with the TSPs of the manually curated metabolic network [ 51 ] using three different null models that are labelled ‘unipartite’ , ‘bipartite’ and ‘modular’ . The curve labelled ‘uni - partite’ ( dashed line ) stems from a switch randomization of the network after it has been projected onto its reaction nodes . ‘Bipartite’ ( dotted line ) means the randomized net - works were generated in the bipartite network , treating reversible reactions separately , and then counting three - node subgraphs in the reaction - centric projections . The ‘modular’ ( dashed - dotted line ) is obtained from combining the ‘bipar - tite’ switch randomization with biological modules . The untransformed Z - scores can be seen in electronic supplemen - tary material , ﬁgure S6 .

TSP of a graph with an elevated number of bidirec - tional links compared with the expected value m . Two different randomization - schemes are applied ( i ) simple ﬂip - ping of two link - endpoints , ( ii ) shufﬂing uni - and bidirectional links independently thus preserving the number of bidirectional links in the network . As the analysed network is random apart from its number of bidirectional links , the Z - scores using the correct randomization scheme can be expected to be close to zero . Obtained from graphs with N ¼ 100 and M ¼ 400 , the number of bidirectional links was forced to 90 % instead of the 16 % expected for ER graphs at this connectivity . ( Online version in colour . ) 3430 Artefacts in network motif analyses M . E . Beber et al . J . R . Soc . Interface ( 2012 ) Let N and M be the number of nodes and links of the whole modular network consisting of four modules , as shown in ﬁgure 7 . Then , the count of a speciﬁc subgraph c m in the original graph can be estimated by 4 c m ð N = 4 ; M = 4 Þ , the expectation value of that count in the random graphs by m m = c m ( N , M ) and the standard deviation of the counts by s m by s m ( N , M ) . For details , please refer to electronic supplementary material , § S1 . 1 and Fretter et al . [ 38 ] . The module - unaware null model cor - responds to taking the subgraph counts in the four modules , modelled as independent networks and compar - ing them with the total network containing all nodes and links . The resulting prediction is plotted in ﬁgure 8 and ﬁts the numerical results very well . When all links are inter - modular , the effect of the modularity should vanish ; electronic supplementary material , ﬁgure S3 shows that thisisthe case both in theexperimentand in the prediction . The results of ﬁgure 8 and electronic supplemen - tary material , ﬁgure S3 clearly show that switch randomization performed on graphs with regions of varying densities leads to pathological signals in the TSP . Community detection algorithms work well as a remedy in this case , because they assess the quality of their module partition by comparing the number of links within a module with an expectation value as , for example , deﬁned in eqn 5 of Newman & Girvan [ 12 ] . Thus , the quality measure , modularity , of the detected communities takes into account the relevant densities . However , community detection is a broad ﬁeld of network science , and no perfect algorithms exist . A detailed discussion of community detection is beyond the scope of this study , but the reader is encouraged to look into relevant reviews such as Fortunato [ 56 ] . We would like to point out that Z - scores of triads in metabolic networks used in studies such as [ 46 , 57 , 58 ] have not accounted for the strong modularity that was discussed earlier . The curves labelled ‘modular’ in ﬁgures 4 and 5 show the respective TSPs using switch randomization that is module - aware on the level of the bipartite network . In ﬁgures 4 and 5 , the Z - scores are shifted closer to zero , which could result from a more restricted search space of the null model . Each reaction was manually assigned to a module based on its biological function . In Ravasz et al . [ 53 ] , it has been shown that topological modules largely over - lap with metabolic functional categories . Automated assignment of reactions to modules , based , e . g . on gene ontology classes , is therefore plausible . The func - tional groups are mentioned in § 2 . 2 . Comparing the TSPs with ﬁgure 4 and also ﬁgure 5 , some general trends can be observed . A change from the complete network to one without links by currency metabolites leads to greatly increased absolute Z - scores , and in the case of the reaction - centric projection to an inversion of the general trend of the curve . Proceeding to a switch randomization on the level of the bipartite graph causes another change in the trend of the TSP , yet , the absolute Z - scores are lower than on the unipartite level . Using a module - aware randomization scheme then further lowers the absolute values of the Z - scores . It should be noted that in cases where both modularity and a ( corresponding ) non - zero TSP are observed in a real network , it is not clear as to how to assign causality . The only statement we can make is that part of an observed motif signature ( or TSP ) can be explained by modularity . It would be helpful to have appropriate statistical methods for two tests addressing the intrinsic causality among these inter - related network properties : could a non - modular ( or less modular ) graph host the same motif signature ? Does the graph’s modularity explain only part of the ‘signal strength’ observed in the motif sig - nature or is the amplitude ( or average Z - score ) of the motif signature fully accounted for by the given modular - ity ? In addition , overlapping modules , where nodes cannot be unambiguously assigned to individual modules , will have different impacts on the TSP than described here . 3 . 4 . Networks with hierarchies Similar to modularity , a hierarchical organization can cause distortions in a simple switch randomization . Figure 7 . A graph composed of four strong modules .

Interface ( 2012 ) Here , we will provide an example of a toy model that has some basic properties of metabolic networks . In metabolism , we can distinguish an input layer provided by the set of uptake reactions ( with the input provided by the available nutrients in the environment ) , a set of middle layers , where reactions process the nutrients and an output layer consisting of all reactions directly con - tributing to cell growth ( i . e . the ‘biomass vector’ often encountered in constrained - based modelling of meta - bolic systems ) . In the following , we will discuss layered random networks ( inspired by the Kaluza – Mikhailov model of evolved ﬂow networks ; [ 59 ] ) . The input layer is deﬁned by a set of nodes with zero in - degree ; the output layer is given by the set of nodes with zero out - degree . Middle nodes may receive a link from the input layer . They may also be interconnected with other middle nodes and they may be connected to the output nodes . The only topological restriction is that input nodes may not directly be connected to output nodes . An example of such a layered random network is shown in ﬁgure 9 . In ﬁgure 10 , we illustrate the effect of a hierarchical structure on the TSP using such a graph with three layers . Depicted are TSPs for standard switch randomization and for a randomization disallowing links from input to output nodes . Note that all the randomization methods keep the degree of nodes constant , i . e . input nodes ( output nodes ) retain their zero in - degree ( zero out - degree ) . Because no additional motif bias ( beyond the bias introduced by the layer structure ) has entered the network generation , the correct null model ought to yield a ﬂat TSP with all Z - scores close to zero . 4 . DYNAMIC DATA ON MOTIFS Beyond the purely structural issues , a completely new set of complications arises when dynamic information on graphs is added . The signiﬁcance proﬁles discussed so far are obtained from contrasting the few - node sub - graph counts in the given graph with subgraph counts from a suitable pool of randomized graphs . It yields statistical indicators pointing only to graph features that might be of functional relevance . In biological networks , this is particularly tangible , as deviations from randomness ( with the right null model ) can be interpreted as the inﬂuence of the evolutionary shaping of the network . However , this statistical observation needs to be linked back to the functional level in a more direct manner in subsequent investigations . Alon and co - workers have carried out this convincingly in the case of several three - node subgraphs ( in particular , the feed - forward loop motif ) by explicitly modelling dynamic processes on such a motif and classifying the signal processing capacities of such a few - node device [ 60 , 61 ] . A powerful alternative to this direct modelling is to analyse the systematics of dynamic data within a motif , i . e . on each individual node in a motif or distributed across the motif occurrences in the network . This has , for example , been performed in Krumov et al . [ 62 ] for cita - tion frequencies on ( undirected ) co - authorship networks , in Marr et al . [ 63 ] for gene expression data on transcrip - tional regulatory networks , and in Sonnenschein et al . [ 64 ] for reaction essentiality categories . In this work , we apply FBA to identify essential reac - tions in the metabolic network of E . coli . Within this elegant framework [ 28 , 65 ] , the optimal steady - state dis - tribution of metabolic ﬂuxes can be predicted using linear programming , given the structure of the environ - ment ( i . e . the availability of nutrients ) and the cellular objective function ( e . g . biomass production or ATP maximization ) . All reactions whose elimination proved lethal in a wide range of different environmental con - ditions were considered essential . Please refer to electronic supplementary material , § S1 . 2 for speciﬁcs . We use two schemes for analysing the distribution of dynamic data across motifs : ( i ) a single counting scheme , where a node can contribute its dynamic information ( the value attached to this node , when mapping dynamic data onto the graph ) only once to each subgraph type or ( ii ) a multiple counting scheme , which counts a node’s dynamic information multiple times , if this node is part of multiple subgraphs of one type . The normalization differences between the two counting schemes , when aver - aging the dynamic information , often yield different results , in particular in cases where the dynamic infor - mation and the number of subgraphs a node participates in both scale non - trivially with the node’s degree . In ﬁgure 11 , we show the Z - score of the probability of the occurrence of an essential reaction for each triad in Figure 9 . An example of the layered random network inspired by Kaluza et al .

The networks contain 20 input nodes , 50 middle nodes , 20 output nodes and with the probability of a link being present of 0 . 3 . We show Z - scores resulting from a random ensemble that was created using standard switch randomization ( scheme 1 ) and a curve obtained from switch randomization with the additional constraint of disal - lowing direct links between the input and the output layer ( scheme 2 ) .

Interface ( 2012 ) the network when compared with a random distribution of essential reactions on the network . The surprising result is that essential reactions occur less frequently than expected in all types of three - node subgraphs with the exception of the ‘chain’ ( id 12 ) . This shows that essen - tial reactions occur in non - random situations in the metabolic network . The exceptional situation of triads with id 12 remains to be explored further . Next , we use the results from electronic supplemen - tary material , ﬁgure S7 to relate the functional role of the triads back to the motif signature . The details can be found in electronic supplementary material , § S4 . Compared with the TSP from Eom et al . [ 46 ] ( positive correlations with the essentiality distribution curves ) , we ﬁnd systematically negative correlations for our reﬁned TSPs . The ‘unipartite’ TSP ( enhanced treat - ment of currency metabolites ) shows the strongest ( negative ) correlation , but also the ‘bipartite’ ( ran - domization on the level of the bipartite graph ) and the ‘modular’ TSP ( module - aware randomization ) display negative correlations . 5 . CONCLUSIONS We have systematically explored biases introduced into motif signatures by variations of the random back - ground , i . e . of the set of reference graphs serving as null models . Making visible the cross - talk between global and local network properties is , in our opinion , an important prerequisite of any interpretation of motif signatures . We want to point out that although sometimes real artefacts can be found , most of the time the bound - ary between a relevant result and an artefact is rather ambiguous . General features of networks with a simple explanation will sometimes be most visible in the motif signature . For example , in the case of modu - larity , a clear motif signature is easily obtained , while the modular structure of the network is much more difﬁcult to detect and to understand . The motif signa - ture can thus serve as a marker for non - random network features on diverse topological scales . A major conceptual step in systems biology is to reveal systematic and signiﬁcant deviations of a biologi - cal system from randomness , and subsequently relate these deviations to speciﬁc functional features . Both , our own analyses and the few attempts found in the lit - erature of exploring network motifs in metabolism show the immense difﬁculty of disentangling contributions to motif signatures coming from the mere network con - struction and those coming from the evolutionary shaping of the system towards an optimized function . Even though our reﬁned TSPs can be regarded as better approximations to the true enhancement or suppression of three - node subgraphs metabolic systems may have evolutionarily acquired , it is clear that additional reﬁnement steps should be taken into account . In recent publications , Basler et al . [ 42 , 47 ] have presented and motivated a novel method for generating chemically sensible , mass - balanced randomized metabolisms . The main idea being that physico - chemical constraints are part of the null model so that any remaining deviations must result from evolutionary pressure and are thus worth studying . Basler et al . [ 42 ] discuss a number of structural properties that show changed results when compared with this new null model . Some dynamical systems are highly sensitive to motifs as small functional devices . A whole range of investi - gations have identiﬁed a deep relationship between network motifs and the robust functioning of systemic processes [ 7 , 59 , 60 , 66 , 67 ] . In order to understand the gen - erality and fundamental nature of these links between topology and dynamics , one needs better knowledge of 6 36 12 74 14 78 38 98 108 46 102 110 238 6 36 12 74 14 78 38 98 108 46 102 110 238 Z - s c o r e – 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 – 8 – 6 – 4 – 2 0 2 4 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 11 . Using two different methods of artiﬁcial growth media generation for ﬂux balance analysis , all plots show Z - scores of the probability of ﬁnding essential reactions in certain triads when compared with 1000 random distributions of the same number of essential reactions on the network . The artiﬁcial growth media are called ‘Random’ for viable selections among all possible nutrients , and ‘Combinatorial’ for all minimal combinations of nutrients that sustain growth . ( a ) The frequency of exactly three essential reactions is a stringent measure and occurs almost as often as in the random models . The only exception is the ‘chain’ - like triad with id 12 . There is an agglomeration of three essential reactions on that triad . ( b ) Z - scores for essential reactions using a single counting scheme which also shows the particular role of the triad with id 12 but shows that in the accumulated case , i . e . an exact number of essential reactions participating in the subgraph is not required , essential reactions occur rather less fre - quently when compared with the null model .

E . Beber et al . 3433 J . R . Soc . Interface ( 2012 ) the intrinsic statistical properties of few - node subgraphs as well as the most minimal dynamical situations , in which such a relationship between topology and dynamics can occur . With the present investigation , we want to contribute to this understanding of statistical signals obtained from motif analyses . We advocate care - fully chosen null models designed with a profound grasp of the system under investigation . This also means that once more facts about the system are discovered , the chosen null model may have to be adapted . Throughout the paper , we emphasized the impor - tance of these considerations for understanding metabolic systems as our main case study . However , a proper treatment of the cross - talk among various topo - logical properties of complex networks ( and in particular , an evaluation of larger - scale properties inﬂu - encing subgraph statistics ) has a much broader range of application . We thus believe that this small catalogue of topological features inﬂuencing the interpretation of subgraph counts in complex networks can be used for reﬁning and correcting empirical observations of TSPs and also as starting points to expand our theoreti - cal understanding of the crosstalk between different topological properties of complex networks .
