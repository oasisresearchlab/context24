New York : Routledge , 2011 . BIBLID [ 0873 - 626X ( 2012 ) 33 ; pp . 540 - 545 ] Audi’s ( third ) introduction to the theory of knowledge is a magnifi - cent work and an excellent tool . It is very well organized and displays much information about a huge amount of epistemological and philo - sophical problems . If we compare this edition with the previous one ( 2003 ) , we can see that there are now more sections dedicated to issues which were not addressed before . We now have sections about perceptual justification and perceptual knowledge , internalist and externalist versions of virtue epistemology , the value problem , and theories of truth . This increase of information and debates makes this introduction even more comprehensive and attractive than its ante - cessors . So if the previous editions were already great in almost every aspect , this one is even better . Having said that , we must point out that Audi’s book is not for the fainted of heart , nor it is really a simple introduction to epistemology stricto sensu , at least not as we construe a simple introduction ( see , for example , Lemos , N . , An Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge , New York , 2007 ; and Pritchard , D . , What is This Thing Called Knowledge , Oxon , 2006 ) . Comprehensiveness has often costs for the beginner . The high amount of information displayed in Audi’s work may be useful for a number of reasons , but has a serious downside : it is hard to cope with ( perhaps even to people with some experience ) . We are talking about valuable and wide - ranging information , no doubt , but when confronted by it , the reader may very well feel a bit intimidated . This and the inherent complexities associated with the topics at hand may difficult things for the reader with no previous contact with those topics . And since Audi is a philosopher within the analytical tradition , he strives to do the analysis of almost every concept he presents . Furthermore , an argument looms in every page ( or on most of the pages ) . Perhaps this is a good strategy . Some may be charmed by the book style and passionately read it from the first to the last page , but some may feel frightened and leave it on the library . Be as it may , one thing is quite certain : this introduction is not for the masses , in the sense that it is not exactly easy for the layman to read and understand . As before , Audi’s introduction to the content of the book is in fact a small introduction to the theory of knowledge . It is a classical Book Reviews 541 ouverture ranging over traditional problems in the area : What can we know ? What are the sources of evidence , justification , knowledge and , ultimately , truth ? What can and should we believe given the available evidence ? What grounds and justifies our beliefs ? And so forth . Argumentative answers to these questions are given across the volume . This is why we think that Audi’s work is also an introductory theory of knowledge rather than just an introduction to the theory of knowledge . Another aspect worth mentioning is that this book is not only an introduction to the theory of knowledge but also an introduction to the theory of justification . One must not be surprised by this , given that the knowledge issues and the justification issues have been linked for so long in the history of philosophy ( since Plato , according to many specialists ) , and chiefly in the second half of the twentieth century , because of the well - known Gettier Problem . As in his earlier works on justification , and following a long standing trend in epistemology , Audi main concern lies on the grounding of belief . The debate over what appropriately grounds belief cut - crosses the entire work and , in one way or anoth - er , drives the author’s pencil , motivations and arguments . So just like Chisholm’s three theories of knowledge ( but mostly the first two ) , Audi’s introduction is also a state of the art manual about evidence and justification . If nothing else was good , just that would be a suffi - cient reason to get the book . But since almost everything else is good , this is a plus for the lucky reader . Now , since we are challenged by an extensive and wide - ranging work , it is impossible to comment on everything . So we chose to stress only what seems to us excellent and what , in our opinion , is not so good . Concerning Part One , on the sources of knowledge , the presenta - tion about the available theories of perception is very good indeed . It is exhaustive and has the right sequence . It allows the reader to un - derstand quite well the problems surrounding perception ( mostly vision ) and the importance of this source in the economics of knowledge and justification . And the same can be said about the memory presentation . The theoretical resemblance of the theories of perception and the theories of memory is used to facilitate the expla - nation and the understanding . And the section about introspection is perfectly structured as well . Here ( p . 91 ) we find a first approach to Book Reviews 542 the solipsism problem and , of course , to skepticism about the exist - ence of other minds . The first section about reason ( 5 ) is excellent because of the over - all quality of the presentation , but mainly because it allows the reader to cope with traditionally hard problems about truths of reason . The distinction between necessary , analytic , a priori , and synthetic propo - sitions ( according to the way they are or the way they are grasped ) is very useful . Though a bit technical , the given explanation on these ‘modalities’ can help the beginner to deal with the tremendous amount of complications usually steaming for philosophy of language , metaphysics and epistemology . On the other hand , the second section about reason ( 6 ) will be for sure very useful to instructors and non - beginner students . It is a natural follow up of its antecessor , going deeper inside the matters of definition and of hybrid propositions ( e . g . , analytic a priori ) . It is even possible to find on a graphic ( see Figure 6 . 1 . , p . 139 ) a typology of the classic and revised views about these combinations . The attention placed on the a priori , generally conceived , and on the a priori justification , is extensive ( see Figure 6 . 2 . , p . 144 ) . Again , by reading this section one can ‘fell’ the influen - tial role that philosophy of language and metaphysics take in the epistemological debate . On the section about testimony as a source of knowledge we can find a good debate over the issue of whether or not testimony is indeed a basic source for knowledge and justification ( p . 159 ) . Audi argues that it is not ( p . 161 ) , but stresses the relevance of testimonial grounds for belief justification and , therefore , to many belief - candidates to knowledge . Also interesting and well put is the view that though testimony is not a basic source of knowledge it is a prime - val source of knowledge . Concerning Part Two . First a comment on the inference and the extension of knowledge section ( 8 ) . We would like to underline the intrinsic difficulty of this section . As we said earlier , Audi’s book may be harsh to the novice and the layman . Let me illustrate with a pas - sage : Suppose we conceive his reasoning as deductive , say because Luigi’s un - derlying principle—roughly , the one by which his reasoning is actually guided—is not the expected inductive one—that all if all As are Bs and x is a B of a kind that might well be expected to be an A then probably x is Book Reviews 543 an A —but the false principle that if all As are Bs , and x is a B of a kind that might be expected to be an A , then x is ( certainly ) an A . ( p . 188 ) This is a bit difficult to follow , but maybe this particular explanation could not be done otherwise . Nevertheless , it is comprehensiveness at the cost of simplification . One crucial notion about inference entertained by Audi along the - se pages is that inference is not a basic source of justification of knowledge or justification . According to him , inference is just a way to transmit them , but in order for the transmission to occur the starting premises must already be justified and knowledge ( p . 191 ) . And yet another important moment of his assessment of these matters has to do with the way that deductive inferences are valid and induc - tive inferences are ‘good’ . All of this is very well explained and argued for , so we encourage the reader to try reading these chapters , regardless of their difficulty . The second section of Part Two is dedicated to the old subject of how the knowledge belief candidates must be related in order to be justified and knowledge . The section ( 9 ) is dubbed the architecture of knowledge , and it is as its predecessors very comprehensive and in - formative . Here Audi deals with the various hypotheses available concerning the shape of the chain of beliefs ( and justifications ) . His evaluation goes beyond the usual quadripartite account of the chain : foundationalism , coherentism , infinitism and skepticism ( the latter if the chain of beliefs ends in a belief which is not knowledge or it is not in any way justified ) . At the end , Audi takes a non - neutral stance towards the problem , arguing for what it is there called moderate foundationalism . He thinks that this sort of foundationalism has less problems ( or easier to solve problems ) than the other hypotheses , mainly coherentism , and so it is preferable to them . In the Part Three of introduction we find a conflation of several themes . The first section ( 10 ) concerns the problem of the analysis of knowledge . Here we can see that Audi still ( considering his previous works on the subject ) embraces the idea that knowledge is some sort of reliably formed , properly grounded , true belief ( see p . 291 ) . One must do justice to the author and say that he does not intend to offer an analysis , and that he warn us about the problems faced by any candidate to a successful analysis . He explicitly claims that he is not offering an analysis of knowledge but a conception of knowledge ( see note 20 , p . 294 ) . But he also leaves an open door for the analysis Book Reviews 544 possibility ( see the same note ) , and his so - called conception of knowledge very much seems a disguised analysis of knowledge . Now , if there is a lesson ( familiar to Audi , for sure ) to be extracted from the aftermath of the Gettier prominent paper is that no analysis of ‘S knows that p ’ in terms of ‘true justified ( plus condition c ) belief’ will do the job , i . e . , will satisfied all the theoretical and epistemic desidera - ta for a successful analysis . Furthermore , there is little information on Williamson’s arguments ( in our view decisive ) against the possibility of such a successful analysis . All this seems to go against Audi’s posi - tion concerning this theme . The second section ( 11 ) of Part Three returns to the subject of justification and its origins . Here Audi engages the topics of internalism and externalism ( about justification and about knowledge ) . He introduces a new subsection devoted to intellectual virtues and their role in the internalist - externalist divide . The follow - ing debate over the value of knowledge is also a novelty in his theory of knowledge . Broadly speaking , he holds that knowledge is more valuable than true belief simpliciter or than justified true belief . He thinks that the latter is valuable because of pragmatic reasons , chiefly because justified true belief , whether or not knowledge , may always contribute to understanding and perhaps to other cognitive achieve - ments . We think this can be disputed . It may be argued , for example , that justified true belief which is not knowledge cannot be treasured in light of the problems which preclude that it is knowledge . Luckily justified true beliefs and justified fortuitously true beliefs can hardly be valuable , unless they are taken as a crucial element of a cognitive process . This may happen , but it is not the rule , so we think that Audi’s argument here is far from being convincing . Yet in this section we get some information about truth . The main theories of truth are introduced with simplicity but also with efficien - cy . The reader becomes more acquainted with a crucial element associated with knowledge that theorists often leave outside their debates or take as peripheral , mostly because they think that truth is a subject for metaphysics and philosophy of language , rather than for epistemology . At the end , Audi declares ( p . 290 ) that the best choice for those ( like him , so it seems ) that embrace an account of knowledge as reliably grounded belief is a moderate account of truth as correspondence . Again , this shows that we are not , for the best or the worst , face to face with a neutral introduction to the theory of knowledge . The reader is allowed to choose his path , but the presen - Book Reviews 545 tation is argumentative towards specific conceptions of truth , knowledge and justification . Section 12 is dedicated to introduce the specific proprieties and problems of three types of knowledge : the scientific , the moral and the religious . The presentation is broad but very enlightening , allow - ing once more the reader to become quite well acquainted with the basics . But once again it is argumentative here and there , trying to convince the reader about a particular view . For example , in the debate over whether or not religious knowledge ( knowledge of the divinities and their deeds ) is possible ( p . 320 ) , Audi clearly assumes the role of the religious paladin , seeking to defend the possibility of that kind of knowledge . He argues for the plausibility of his own so - called experincialism , a sort of direct acquaintance of the mind with religious truths or facts . This should not be by itself a reason to criti - cize Audi’s work , but one cannot escape the thought that maybe an introduction to the theory of knowledge is not the right place to defend our own religious preferences , even if supported by argu - ments . Audi ends the volume with two amazing chapters about skepti - cism . He is not a skeptic , as we saw before , and that becomes very clear on these chapters . He deals perfectly well with the main issues around fallibility and error , epistemological relativism and the differ - ence between common sense views of knowledge and hypothetic skeptical scenarios . Audi’s book is the best and most complete introductory work to the theory of knowledge we have read so far . We think that it is an indispensable piece on the bookshelves of every instructor of episte - mology and a fine acquisition to those who wish to enter deep into the subjects of knowledge and justification .
