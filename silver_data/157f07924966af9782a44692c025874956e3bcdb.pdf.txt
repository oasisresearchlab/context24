While the severity of this “lockdown” period varied by country , the disruptions of the pandemic on multiple facets of life ( e . g . , daily activities , education , the workplace ) as well as the social , economic , and healthcare systems impacts were unprecedented . These disruptions and impacts are having a profound negative effect on multiple facets of behavioral health and psychosocial wellbeing that are inextricably linked to cardiometabolic health and associated with adverse outcomes of COVID - 19 . For example , adoption of various cardiometabolic risk behavior behaviors observed during the pandemic contributed to irretractable trends in weight gain and poor mental health , raising concerns on the possible long - term consequences of the pandemic on cardiometabolic disease risk , and vulnerabilities to future viral pandemics . The purpose of this review is to summarize the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic on cardiometabolic health risk behaviors , particularly related to poor diet quality , physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors , smoking , sleep patterns and mental health . Additional insights into how the pandemic has amplified cardiovascular risk behaviors , particularly in our most vulnerable populations , and the potential implications for the future if these modifiable risk behaviors do not become better controlled , are described . Key Words : COVID - 19 , cardiovascular disease ; health behaviors J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof 4 The Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic is an unprecedented global health crisis that continues to impact nearly every health , economic and social aspect of life worldwide . 1 During the initial surge of the pandemic , several countries and most state / local governments within the United States ( US , 45 out of 50 states ) issued temporary shelter in place orders to suppress community transmission of COVID - 19 transmission , with an overarching goal of mitigating viral spread and protecting those most vulnerable to severe illness . 2 Included under these public health mitigation strategies were closures of schools and varying levels of restrictions on outdoor recreation , social gatherings , and economic activities . Although these measures have helped saved lives , they have come with added sociodemographic and behavioral health costs , fueling a nexus for preventable lifestyle - related noncommunicable chronic diseases ( NCDs ) , and potentially worsening unhealthy lifestyle , cardiometabolic risk factor and NCD pandemics that have been ongoing well before the emergence of COVID - 19 . 3 , 4 Multiple studies consistently demonstrate that prevalence of certain common cardiometabolic conditions , such as obesity , type - 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , and hypertension significantly heightens the risk and severity of COVID - 19 , including in - hospital mortality . 2 , 5 - 7 , 8 Whether presence of either of these conditions directly make individuals more susceptible to COVID - 19 and its complications is unclear , as it is also plausible that certain behavioral risk factors physiologically make individuals more susceptible to infection . 2 , 9 , 10 For example , extensive restrictions implemented during the peak lockdown period ( March through May 2020 ) coincided with reduced step count 11 and concurrent increases in snacking , energy - dense and healthy food consumption , 12 sedentary behaviors ( SB ) , 13 and unfavorable sleep patterns 14 that supported weight gain and poor mental health . 12 , 15 Findings from a recently published comparative risk assessment study found that nearly 64 % of the > 900 , 000 COVID - 19 hospitalizations occurring in the US through November 2020 were attributable primarily to obesity ( 30 . 2 % ) , hypertension ( 26 . 2 % ) , and T2D ( 20 . 5 % ) , suggesting that the majority of hospitalizations could have been prevented if these conditions were not J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof 5 present . 8 Individuals with obesity were found to have increased risk of COVID - 19 hospitalization and severe illness similarly across the lifespan in adults 2 , 8 as well as in children and adolescents 16 — an observation that is not surprising given the role of obesity in inciting inflammation , 17 and impairing the immune response as evidenced in prior disease - related pandemics ( e . g . , 2009 H1N1 Influenza A Virus ) . 18 Of grave concern were the well documented higher cases of COVID - 19 19 among racially and ethnically minorized communities with whom already had unequal burden due to the higher prevalence of cardiometabolic comorbidities 20 and are more likely to suffer worse outcomes , 21 - 23 bringing to the forefront longstanding health inequities and further perpetuating health disparities . 24 With current estimates of over 537 million confirmed cases of COVID - 19 worldwide , 25 a death toll in excess of 6 . 32 million , more than 1 . 01 million occurring in the US 25 with most occurring in individuals diagnosed with or predisposed to NCDs , 2 , 8 the robust impact of poor cardiometabolic health on risk of COVID - 19 outcomes is gravely concerning . Prior to COVID - 19 , modifiable lifestyle - related NCDs were the leading causes of adverse physical and mental health outcomes and pre - mature mortality globally 26 , including the US . 27 In this context , it is critical to understand the impact of the current viral pandemic on underlying obesogenic behavioral and lifestyle factors driving cardiometabolic risk that could also predispose or exacerbate COVID - 19 related outcomes . Equally important to consider is the collateral toll of the pandemic on mental and behavioral health , which has drastically impacted lifestyle behaviors and quality of life , especially among older , racially and ethnically minoritized , low - income populations . 28 In this review , we aim to highlight the direct and indirect effects of the COVID - 19 pandemic on cardiometabolic and obesogenic health behaviors , particularly related to poor diet quality , physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors , smoking , sleep patterns and mental health . We will further theorize the implications for the future if these modifiable risk behaviors do not become better controlled . Effects of COVID - 19 Lockdown on Diet Quality and Behaviors J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof 6 The COVID - 19 pandemic and stay - at - home orders across the world have had substantial consequences on the access to food and dietary behavior , contributing to population - wide shifts in food choices and eating behaviors worldwide . Despite limitations in food availability and accessibility during the peak lockdown period , the effects of the pandemic on dietary practices have been fairly inconsistent . 12 Studies reporting on the deleterious dietary behavior adopted during the pandemic have been described with respect to concomitant trends in weight gain . 12 , 15 , 29 - 31 Bhutani et al . examined weight gain and lifestyle habits of 727 adults in the US both during peak lockdown and at a five month follow - up . Results showed that 18 . 2 % of respondents gained at least 1 - 4 pounds and 19 % gained 5 or more pounds . 30 Another study in a smaller cohort of US adults reported similar to larger gains in body weight of 5 - 10 pounds during the observed lockdown period . 32 In European and Middle Eastern countries , a greater proportion ( i . e . , 35 % - 49 % ) of residents reported experiencing weight gain , though average gains were modest ( i . e . , 2 - 4 pounds ) . 12 , 29 , 31 Nonetheless , poor dietary behaviors consistently associated with weight gain across studies included : 1 ) increased snacking , especially in the evening ; 2 ) snacking on energy dense and nutrient poor foods ; 3 ) increased intake of sweets and comfort foods ; and 4 ) increase in quantity of food consumed regardless of nutritional value . 12 , 29 - 31 Other changes in food choices that contributed to poorer diet quality , and resultingly , suboptimal dietary patterns during the pandemic included decreased fresh fruit , vegetable , and fish consumption , increased consumption of starchy vegetables , ultra - processed foods , and red and processed meats . 12 , 29 , 30 Consequently , each of these behaviors have been shown to complicate cardiometabolic health and contribute to an increased risk of NCDs . 33 The intensions of public - mandated social distancing and quarantine measures were to reduce transmission spread of the COVID - 19 virus . However , home confinement and changes in cohabitation dynamics , increased unemployment , and uncertainties of food availability , accessibility and affordability brought on by the pandemic triggered a spiral of psychological problems that contributed further to dysfunctional eating habits . 34 - 36 Psychological distress and J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof 7 worsening mental health , including depression and anxiety have specifically been linked to emotional overeating of ultra - processed foods , and increased weight gain during the peak pandemic period 12 , 30 , 31 , 37 , 38 In a large study of 1865 participants surveyed in Italy , Lo Moro et al showed that 57 . 6 % of respondents reported depression while 49 . 3 % reported emotional overeating of pastries and foods high in fat and sugar , and 35 . 2 % reported both conditions during the lockdown . 39 Prevalence of emotional eating appears to be higher in women , and in individuals with pre - existing overweight or obesity , the latter of which is not surprising considering evidence suggesting that the relationship between stress and emotional eating may be modulated by body mass index ( BMI ) . 36 Other studies have shown that pandemic - related increases in emotional overeating and general overeating due to boredom are associated with increased screen time , 12 , 30 , 40 an established risk factor of obesity . 41 Surges in screen time due to working from home , on - line education , and increased social media usage are inevitable consequences of the pandemic , that may have contributed to worsening depression and more severe anxiety . 42 , 43 While evidence is mixed regarding the influence of greater screen time on food intake and weight gain during pandemic , 32 , 40 it is worth acknowledging that the inter - relationship of these behaviors may explain the increased incidence and overall burden of mental health problems resulting from pandemic . 44 While the unfavorable effects of the pandemic on diet is more widely reported , some populations did in fact , demonstrate positive changes in diet patterns or eating behaviors during the pandemic . 12 , 29 , 30 For example , in the French NutriNet - Santé study of 37 , 252 adults , 14 . 1 % of respondents indicated their diet improved , and 74 . 4 % reported no change . 29 Favorable changes in diet behaviors included decreased consumption of sweets and increase in fresh fruit , vegetable , and fish intake along with avoidance of certain foods for weight management reasons , an interest in balancing their diets , and spending more time making home cooked meals . Further analyses indicated that participants who improved in their diet - risk behaviors were overweight or obese at baseline , experienced increased anxiety without depression , and J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof 8 had a poor diet quality prior to lockdown . Notably , however , those who reported improvements or no change in diet - related practices were more likely to occur in those with higher versus lower socioeconomic status , an observation that echoes socioeconomic inequalities in nutrition . 45 In another study of 1140 adults in Spain , one third of participants increased fresh food intake and decreased packaged food intake . Accordingly , adoption of nutritionally - favored behaviors were most notable in younger adults aged 18 - 35 years who reported increased physical activity ( PA ) , whereas those over 65 displayed no significant changes in dietary practices . 46 The unprecedented COVID - 19 pandemic has led to untoward changes in children and adolescents daily routines , including an increase in unfavorable diet and lifestyle behavioral practices , which are concordant with the striking increase in pediatric overweight and obesity . 47 - 49 Results from a multi - country study of adolescents aged 10 - 19 years noted that while increases in fruit , vegetable , and legume consumption and decrease in fast food consumption correlated with improved dietary profiles , such improvements were offset by tandem increases in fried and sweet food consumption and screen time during meals . 50 Moreover , greater consumption of fruit juice , pasta , fried potato intake , red meat , sweets , salty / total snacks , and breakfast foods , which are associated with increases in body weight in children and adolescents , has also been reported as result of the COVID - 19 lockdown . 48 , 51 , 52 Notably , adoption of riskier dietary practices clearly translated to excess weight gain , though these observations were disproportionately more evident in those with a pre - existing elevation in body weight . For example , Cena et al showed that children with obesity prior to the pandemic appear to be at a higher risk of negative lifestyle changes ( e . g . , poor diet , reduced PA ) and weight gain during lockdown . 52 Children with pre - existing obesity were also more likely to have lower states of wellbeing and psychophysical health , attributed largely to poor food choices , increased snacking between meals , and greater intake of comfort - foods . 52 If poor dietary practices are sustained , as one small cohort study suggests , 48 these findings could have far - reaching J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof 9 implications on long - term pediatric health that warrants both acknowledgement and urgent action to implement earlier behavioral screening and intervention strategies , especially in overweight / obese children at high risk of adverse health trajectories . How the COVID - 19 Pandemic has Affected PA and SB Regardless of sex , age , race , or body composition , PA has been found to be beneficial in reducing stress , improving sleep , lowering CVD risk factors , obesity , and systemic inflammation as well as improving mood and cognitive function . 53 Currently , PA guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity aerobic PA or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic PA . Despite these benefits , many struggle to adhere to these recommendations . According to federal monitoring data by the National Institute of Health , only 25 % of healthy men and 19 % of healthy women meet these guidelines for PA . 54 Additionally , sedentary behavior ( SB ) , which includes sitting or lying down beyond sleep , is a distinct entity from physical inactivity and has been found to be an independent risk factor for NCDs and all - cause mortality . 55 To highlight the importance of this and help overcome the problem , the World Health Organization provided guidelines on SB and PA with a goal to reduce physical inactivity by 15 % over the next 10 years . 56 Unfortunately , due to the COVID - 19 pandemic , efforts to increase PA and reduce SB have been even more challenging . In a recent meta - analysis , Runacres et al examined the change in sedentary time during the pandemic and its overall effect on health for the general population ( N = 282 , 202 participants ) , subcategorizing into children ( < 18 years ) , adults ( 18 - 64 years ) and older adults ( > 65 years ) . Among 262 , 630 adults ( 93 . 1 % ; 36 . 5 ± 5 . 5 years ) , sedentary time increased by 126 . 9 ± 42 . 2 min / day , whereas older adults ( 1 . 2 % ; 60 . 6 ± 8 . 0 years ) experienced smaller increases in sedentary time by 46 . 9 ± 22 . 0 min / day . Notably , children increased their sedentary time by 159 . 5 ±142 . 6 min / day , which was the most for any subgroup . The large variations in reporting highlight how multifaceted factors may influence sedentary time and behaviors , including disparities in access to green spaces or outdoor playgrounds used to J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof 10 break - up prolonged sitting time , and pre - existing inequalities and social factors that are historically correlated with increased sedentary time . 13 Furthermore , the increases in sedentary time negatively correlated with mental health and quality of life , regardless of age , highlighting the potentially detrimental implications of sedentary habits on mood disturbance , fatigue , and stress . 13 A recent retrospective study examined effects of PA and SB among 387 older adults ( aged 75 ±6 years ) during the pandemic . 53 Before COVID - 19 , 67 . 9 % , 61 . 9 % , and 48 . 9 % of older adults met the aerobic , muscle - strengthening , and both PA guidelines , respectively . During the first 3 months of the pandemic ( March - May 2020 ) the percentage of older adults meeting aerobic , muscle - strengthening , or both PA guidelines significantly decreased to 54 . 8 % ( −13 . 1 % ) , 46 . 1 % ( −15 . 8 % ) , and 33 . 5 % ( −15 . 4 % ) , respectively , with a concomitant increase in sedentary time by 7 . 4 ± 3 . 1 h / day . Although far from ideal prior to the COVID - 19 pandemic , one year into the pandemic , overall sedentary time ( 6 . 1 ± 2 . 9 h / day ) and the percentage of older adults meeting the PA guidelines were similar to pre - pandemic levels ( 71 . 1 % aerobic , 61 . 3 % muscle - strengthening , 50 . 5 % both ) . Importantly , pre - pandemic BMI and PA levels influenced the likelihood of sedentary time and / or changes in PA patterns during the first 3 months of the pandemic . That is , overweight or obese individuals experienced greater increases in sitting time compared to their normal weight counterparts , and those individuals who met the PA guidelines prior to the pandemic had larger reductions in both aerobic and muscle - strengthening PA during the pandemic . 53 While the exact source for the return of PA and sedentary time one - year after the pandemic is uncertain and likely multifactorial , these findings optimistically suggest that pandemic - related impacts on activity levels is not long - lasting and in fact reversible among populations who are highly prone to have severe COVID - 19 outcomes . 4 , 57 Additional efforts should therefore be placed to highlight the importance of PA and longitudinal studies are needed to examine the effects of physical inactivity and SB on health . The impact of COVID - 19 on Smoking Behaviors J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof 11 Nicotine exposure , through use of tobacco products including smoked and smokeless forms , is the most modifiable behavioral risk factor and a leading cause of preventable NCDs , disability , and death in the US . 58 , 59 Tobacco use causes more than 8 million deaths per year , globally , 60 with approximately half a million deaths in the US . 59 In recent years prior to the COVID - 19 pandemic , considerable progress was made in reducing the number of adults , adolescents and young adults smoking tobacco products . From 2019 to 2020 ( prior to the pandemic ) , the prevalence of adult cigarette smoking alone , the most commonly used product among adults , reached an all - time low of 12 . 5 % ( versus 14 . 0 % in 2019 ) . 61 E - cigarette use , the most commonly used non - cigarette tobacco product , was also considerably lower prior to the pandemic ( 3 . 7 % vs . 4 . 5 % in 2019 ) . 61 The significant progress in preventing and reducing tobacco product use in 2019 quickly stalled as public health efforts transitioned towards the pandemic . In the US , an estimated increase of 0 . 34 pack per month per capita , corresponding to a 14 . 1 % increase in cigarette sales were observed from March 2020 to June 2021 . 62 Although , increase in sales do not necessarily imply changes in tobacco use behavior , it is plausible to suggest that increases in cigarette sales are the result of consumer stockpiling as fears of product accessibility , or shortages and subsequent panic - buying in response to local mitigation strategies . Accordingly , existing research on the impact of COVID - 19 on adult tobacco - related behaviors show variable changes in smoking behavior since the onset of COVID - 19 . 63 Although at the start of the pandemic ( February 2020 ) increases in cigarette smoking consumption ( 30 % - 33 % ) 64 , 65 and e - cigarette use ( 23 % ) 65 were reported in the US among some adult smokers , others ( 28 % ) reported decreases in the number of cigarettes they smoked daily . 66 These inconsistencies in tobacco use behaviors have been reported in other countries as well . 66 - 68 The pandemic not only had a disruptive influence for smoking cessation and tobacco dependence but also has been associated with a decrease in abstinence rates and a 15 % increase in smoking rates among adults . 65 , 66 , 69 Tips from Former Smokers , a national telephone - based tobacco cessation J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof 12 service , reported a 27 % decrease in call volume in 2020 compared to 2019 , indicating that COVID - 19 may be influencing individual smoking cessation efforts . 70 It is well - established that exposure to tobacco products , including smokeless forms and electronic nicotine delivery systems ( ENDS ) are associated with increased risks of CVD events . 58 However , there is a need to better understand what factors associated with the pandemic influenced changes in tobacco use and consumption behaviors and their long - term effects on CVD and other preventable health - related outcomes . Several studies have linked the increase in tobacco product use with interpersonal factors , such as heightened stress , anxiety , loneliness and isolation , and reduced psychosocial well - being . 66 , 67 , 71 , 72 Further , increases in individual - level stress and anxiety attributed to fears about the virus , financial insecurity and job instability , changes in household dynamics , and increased isolation have been described as primary drivers of increased tobacco product use during the pandemic . 66 , 71 Impact of the Pandemic on Psychological Well - Being , Mental Health , and Sleep Behaviors The nation continues to emerge from the COVID - 19 pandemic lockdown period , a period which : 1 ) forced many individuals and families to isolate in their homes ; 2 ) stop or decrease the frequency of seeing friends / family ; 3 ) diminished the ability to participate in group sports and recreational activities ; and 4 ) altered sleep schedules by blurring the boundaries between home , school , and work . Many of these behaviors remain in flux thus offering new opportunities for CVD prevention strategies . One such opportunity is to refocus efforts on the underlying , silent changes caused by the lockdowns , the worsening of mental health symptoms across all age groups and communities . The constraints of psychosocial well - being associated with the COVD - 19 pandemic has further exacerbated existing mental health issues and perceptions by US adults , with an alarming 55 % disclosing harmful effects to their mental health and 71 % expressing concerns about the overall mental health of Americans . 73 The request for services to manage pandemic - J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof 13 related stress and distress parallels these statistics , especially early on in the pandemic , wherein the National Disaster Distress Helpline reported an 8 - fold increase in calls to provide assistance to those experiencing substance abuse or mental health or other behavioral crisis . 74 In 2021 numerous reports were published to document the increased rates of anxiety , depression , and insomnia affecting individuals because of the pandemic lockdown and ongoing fears of what the new normal would eventually be , specifically living with the constant threat of the virus . 75 - 77 Among adult populations , as changes in PA , sleep , smoking , and alcohol intake declined , reported symptoms of depression , anxiety , and stress increased . 78 - 80 There is a known bi - directional relationship between health behaviors and mental health disorders and if such mental health disorders are left untreated they have the potential to directly impact cardiovascular health by negatively impacting behaviors such as diet , PA , sleep , and tobacco use . The impacts on such changes have already started to become apparent as adults that gained five or more pounds during the peak of COVID - 19 related lockdowns have either continued to gain weight or maintained the weight that was gained . 30 Fortunately , among adult populations , recent data has started showing an upward trend in PA levels , improvement in mental well - being , and individuals reporting less feelings of loneliness . 80 Unfortunately , the most impacted proportion of population from the pandemic may fall to the younger generations . 81 The longer - term consequences of the stay - at - home orders on students as they stopped attending school and were taught virtually for three months has been estimated to be full years’ worth of learning lost and significant delays in development , especially among low - income families that did not have access to the internet or computers . 82 , 83 With students no longer going to school , many services provided to students also become inaccessible , including access to mental health counselors , free / reduced breakfast and lunch programs , and before and after care to assist working parents . For many racially and ethnically minoritized and low - income families that relied on such services , pre - existing mental health disparities in these communities widen as the number of children and adolescents reporting J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof 14 symptoms of depression and anxiety soared . 84 During the last two years , studies have reported that children and adolescents are stressed , worry more often , have a higher sense of helplessness , and there are a higher number of reported social and risky behavioral problems ( i . e . , smoking , suicide , academic issues ) . 85 With some resolution and perhaps adjustment to a new normal , post “peak” COVID - 19 , we are seeing children and adolescents return to school , and adults return to work . However , the burgeoning mental and physical effects of COVID - 19 , and now , long - COVID , suggest there is a long - recovery ahead . Public health strategies are needed to re - energize communities after these long , tireless years since COVID - 19 became a part of every household . Such strategies need to start with the foundation of improving individuals’ mental health . As new strategies are developed for CVD prevention , their focus needs to start with providing individuals with the tools needed to properly cope with stress and anxiety , recognize signs and symptoms when their solen mood may be a more serious condition , depression , and overall , how to reach out and access mental health resources when needed . The Heartache of COVID - 19 Pandemic and Where to Go from Here The COVID - 19 pandemic has unquestionably had a multifaceted impact on key cardiovascular health behaviors , including diet quality , PA , tobacco use , sleep , and mental health . However , few studies exist that document the aftermath of the pandemic on critical behavioral targets for CVD prevention . 53 Thus , while most of the world has moved towards adopting a new normal in a post - COVID era , it remains uncertain what long - lasting effects of the COVID - 19 pandemic will have on behavioral patterns , for better or for worse , and how this relationship may impact the growing global burden of CVD and related cardiometabolic disorders . 30 , 86 Emerging studies have attempted to shed light on some promising signs on critical behavioral targets of CVD , such as in PA and SB , which among older adults appear to have returned back to the healthier pre - pandemic levels . 53 Whereas , suboptimal diet behaviors that contributed to weight gain during the initial stages of the pandemic have shown to persist J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof 15 five months after lockdown mandates eased , with additional evidence indicating further weight gain in some populations . 30 Of course , preventing the clear pattern of higher CVD risk and suboptimal health behaviors that have emerged or accelerated during the COVID - 19 pandemic has broader clinical , population and public health implications . Large increases in the prevalence of CVD risk factors and CVD forecasted in the future are due partly by the direct effects of COVID - 19 infection on the cardiovascular system , but also as a consequence of the limited access to quality preventative care and subsequently , reduced monitoring of cardiovascular behaviors during the pandemic . 87 A continued trajectory of worsening health behaviors may exacerbate a long - term sequalae of COVID - 19 on the cardiovascular system . 88 - 90 This is particularly concerning among under - represented and medically marginalized populations who experience disproportionately higher rates of COVID - 19 cases , severity and death , 91 demonstrate lower adherence to cardiovascular health behaviors , 58 and face greater social and structural barriers to behavior change . 92 Reversing the deleterious trends in health behaviors is not for the faint of heart . If anything , the COVID - 19 pandemic has exhausted healthcare systems worldwide and compromised the delivery of high - quality care , leaving much of the world unprepared for the next global health crisis . To mitigate further vulnerabilities to future viruses , like COVID - 19 , a coordinated , more aggressive response by health care providers and educators , national policy advisors , and public health officials that prioritize adoption and implementation of primary and secondary lifestyle - based prevention strategies and encourage equitable health promotion is desperately needed . This type of action is the only tool we have to improve health - outcomes and overall resiliency to future syndemic - level global health emergencies .
