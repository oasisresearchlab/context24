However , for many functional pro - cesses , including transcription initiation , the 3D pair - wise motion of distal chromosomal elements , such as enhancers and promoters , is essential and necessitates dynamic fluidity . Therefore , the in - terplay of chromosome organization and dynamics is crucial for gene regulation . Here , we use a live imaging assay to simultaneously measure the positions of pairs of enhancers and promoters and their transcriptional output in the developing fly embryo while systematically varying the genomic separation between these two DNA loci . Our analysis reveals a combination of a compact globular organization and fast subdiffusive dynamics . These combined features cause an anomalous scaling of polymer relaxation times with genomic separation and lead to long - ranged correlations com - pared to existing polymer models . This scaling implies that encounter times of DNA loci are much less dependent on genomic separation than predicted by existing polymer models , with potentially significant consequences for eukaryotic gene expression . Living systems are built based on information encoded in chromosomes confined in each cell’s nucleus . These meter - long DNA polymers must be highly compacted to fit into the micron - sized structure [ 1 , 2 ] . At the same time , for cells to function , chromosome organization must allow the information content to be accessed and read out through transcription [ 3 , 4 ] . Often transcription can only occur through the spatial interaction of DNA loci , such as enhancers and promoters . They find each other dynam - ically and remain in physical proximity [ 5 – 8 ] . While the distances over which many enhancers function in higher eukaryotes can be up to mega - base pairs in genomic sepa - ration [ 9 – 12 ] , it is unknown how these elements come into proximity , what their typical distance is in 3D space , and how they explore this space dynamically in the process . Specifically , it remains unclear how the real - time physi - cal motion of such coupled pairs of DNA loci determines transcriptional encounters and how this depends on their genomic separation . Over the past decade , the advent of chromosome cap - ture and imaging methods [ 13 ] has given key insights into the 3D spatial organization of chromosomes , with the discovery of structural features such as topologically associating domains ( TADs ) [ 14 – 17 ] , phase - separated nuclear condensates [ 18 – 20 ] , and larger - scale compart - ments [ 21 , 22 ] . These organizing structures have key im - plications for transcriptional regulation [ 23 ] . However , these structures are not static , but have been revealed to be heterogeneous across cells [ 24 , 25 ] and dynamic and short - lived in time [ 26 , 27 ] . The role of the real - time dynamics of pairs of loci is only beginning to be under - stood and remains elusive for focal contacts which are key ∗ These authors contributed equally . † tg2 @ princeton . edu to establishing enhancer – promoter interactions in many systems [ 28 ] . Similarly , from a polymer physics perspective , there is a gap in our understanding of static and dynamic prop - erties of chromosomes . At large scales , across tens to hundreds of TADs , chromosome organization has been suggested to be highly compacted in a crumpled chain configuration ( also referred to as fractal globule ) , a long - lived polymer state with fractal dimension three [ 22 , 29 – 32 ] . Yet , the real - time dynamics of DNA loci revealed by live - imaging experiments exhibit subdiffusion with expo - nents close to the predictions of the simple Rouse poly - mer model [ 33 ] , which predicts a loosely packed ideal chain polymer configuration with fractal dimension two that contrasts the compacted architecture of the crum - pled chain model [ 26 , 27 , 34 – 36 ] . A promising technique to address this gap are scaling approaches that combine fractal organization and subdiffusive dynamics [ 37 – 39 ] , but these have never been tested experimentally . Thus far , experimental data sets have given insight into either static organization [ 14 – 17 , 22 , 32 ] , dynamic properties of chromosomes [ 26 , 27 , 34 , 35 , 40 ] , or tran - scription [ 8 , 36 , 41 – 43 ] , but rarely all at the same time . For instance , previous live measurements of locus pairs occurred at fixed genomic separation in transcriptionally silent loci [ 26 , 27 ] . To investigate how 3D spatial organi - zation and dynamic locus motion control the encounter times of functional DNA loci and thus transcriptional ac - tivation , we require an approach to simultaneously mon - itor the movement of DNA locus pairs and transcription across a series of genomic separations in vivo . Here , we address this problem by live imaging the joint dynamics of two cis - regulatory DNA elements , an en - hancer , and a promoter , while simultaneously monitoring the transcriptional output resulting from their functional dynamic encounters in developing fly embryos . We sys - 2 Figure 1 .

Stochastic real - time trajec - tories of the 3D motion of the two loci show a dynamic search process , with physical proximity required for suc - cessful transcription and a power - law scaling of transcrip - tion probability with genomic separation . While typical 3D distances between the locus pair follow a compact packing consistent with the crumpled chain model , the dynamic properties exhibit fast diffusion , albeit with a diffusion coefficient that increases with genomic separa - tion . These features give rise to an anomalous scaling of polymer relaxation times and long - range correlations in the relative motion of the two loci . This suggests that the enhancer – promoter search process is much less de - pendent on genomic separation than expected based on existing polymer models . Live imaging of chromosome dynamics and transcription . To simultaneously monitor the cou - pled motion of enhancer – promoter pairs and transcrip - tion across multiple genomic separations , we generated fly lines , in which a reporter gene is introduced at var - ious genomic locations from the well - studied Drosophila even - skipped ( eve ) locus ( Fig . 1b ) . The locations of both the endogenous eve enhancers and the promoter of the reporter gene , as well as the transcriptional activity of the reporter gene are measured together using a three - color imaging system ( Fig . 1a , Supplementary Section S1 . 2 ) [ 8 ] . To facilitate transcription , the reporter cassette contains the insulator element homie , which allows sta - ble loop formation with the endogenous homie element in the eve locus ( Fig . 1b ) . We build seven of such reporter constructs , with ge - nomic separations s varying over close to two orders of magnitude from 58kb to 3 . 3Mb , comparable to the dis - tances over which many enhancers function in higher eu - karyotes ( Supplementary Section S1 . 1 ) [ 9 – 12 ] . Impor - tantly , these genomic length - scales span across multiple TADs in the Drosophila genome , with typical median TAD sizes of 90 kb [ 45 ] ( here 18 kb for the eve locus ) . Imaging took place for 30 min during the second half of nuclear cycle 14 ( NC14 ) of embryo development ( Fig . 1c ) , well after the completion of DNA replication . Sis - ter chromatids are tightly coupled together at intervals < 10 kb [ 46 ] . Therefore , our two tagged DNA loci are connected by a single chromatin polymer composed of two coupled chromatids that are not resolved by our mi - 3 Figure 2 .

Inter - locus distance scaling suggests crumpled chain organization . As demonstrated previously [ 8 ] , this system exhibits three topological states ( Fig . 1c ) : an open configuration O off where the homie elements are not bound to each other , and two paired configurations P off and P on , where a loop is formed with either inac - tive or active transcription , respectively . To determine the instantaneous topological and transcriptional state of the system , we adopt an inference approach using a Hidden Markov Model based on the time series of inter - locus distance and transcriptional activity ( Supplemen - tary Section S2 ) . We assign one of these states to each measured configuration , including the hidden P off state ( Fig . 1d ) . A key question is how the inter - locus distances R in the open configuration O off vary with the linear genomic separation s . These distances exhibit broad distribu - tions , which shift systematically with larger separation ( Fig . 2a ) . From a polymer physics perspective , the mean distance ⟨ R ⟩ is expected to scale as s 1 / d , where d is the fractal dimension : while an ideal chain polymer has frac - tal dimension d = 2 , the compact crumpled chain organi - zation has dimension d = 3 [ 31 , 47 ] . In our experiments , we observe a scaling exponent of 1 / d = 0 . 31 ± 0 . 07 for genomic separations up to s = 190 kb , consistent with the crumpled chain model ( Fig . 2b ) . The smaller - than - expected average distances observed for the largest sep - arations ( s = 595 kb , 3 . 3 Mb ) are most likely affected by the average folding of the chromosome [ 48 ] . The distances of the paired configurations are indepen - dent of genomic separation , as anticipated , and exhibit typical distances of 350 − 400 nm ( Fig . 2b ) , consistent with previous measurements of distances within the eve - locus [ 8 , 49 ] . Together , these results reveal a compact crumpled chain architecture of chromosome configura - tions in a range of genomic separations consistent with Hi - C experiments in Drosophila [ 17 ] . 4 Transcriptional activity scales with genomic separation . From the latent state trajectories revealed by our inference approach , we estimate the survival curves of the transcriptionally active state ( Fig . 2c ) . We find a median transcriptional lifetime independent of ge - nomic separation of ( 10 ± 5 ) min ( error : std . across sepa - rations ; Fig . 2d ) . This corresponds to about 3 – 5 indepen - dent rounds of transcription on average , given the typical promoter switching correlation time of the system [ 50 ] . Similarly , the relative proportion of transcriptionally ac - tive states within the paired subpopulation is insensitive to genomic separation ( Fig . 2e ) . In contrast , the overall probability of observing ei - ther of the paired configurations strongly decreases with genomic separation , and exhibits a power - law scaling P ( s ) ∼ s − f , with f = 0 . 9 ± 0 . 2 ( Fig . 2f ) . Since transcrip - tional lifetimes are independent of distance , the scaling of P ( s ) is likely dominated by the search of the two loci to come into contact . Importantly , different polymer mod - els make distinct predictions of the scaling of contact probabilities [ 22 , 31 , 51 ] : for ideal chains , f = 3 / 2 , while crumpled chains exhibit f ≈ 1 . 15 [ 52 ] , which is close to the scaling we observe . To test how these results depend on the nature of the homie insulator - mediated focal contacts in our system , we employed a reporter construct in which the homie se - quence is replaced by a λ DNA sequence of the same length . Interestingly , at 58 kb separation transcriptional encounters still occur , albeit with a shorter median life - time of ( 4 . 9 ± 1 . 2 ) min . Furthermore , the probabil - ity of observing a transcriptional state is reduced from ( 30 ± 5 ) % for the homie version to ( 8 . 5 ± 0 . 8 ) % in the no - homie version . In contrast , barely any of such encoun - ters are found for a 149 kb no - homie separation [ 8 ] , where contact probability decreases from ( 6 ± 1 ) % to > 1 % when the homie sequence is replaced by λ DNA . Together , these results demonstrate quantitatively how both genomic sequence and genomic separation control the rate of transcriptional encounters . Notably , the scal - ing of transcription probabilities with separation suggests that the transition from the open to the paired configu - ration is a key limiting step in transcriptional activation of distal DNA loci , which is limited by the time taken to diffuse into proximity . Characterizing the subdiffusive locus search process . To understand these diffusive time scales , we consider the real - time dynamics of the blue and green - labeled DNA loci . Interestingly , we find that the major - ity of single - cell trajectories sample the whole range of physical distances in each topological state , as they show a similar spread as the ensemble - averaged distribution ( Fig . 3a - c , S8 ) . Thus , rather than existing in constrained configurations as observed in other genomic contexts [ 40 ] , this observation supports the picture of a dynamic search process exploring a broad range of distances . We quantify how this search process is reflected in the motion of individual DNA loci by computing the single - locus MSD M 1 ( t ) = ⟨ ( r i ( t 0 + t ) − r i ( t 0 ) ) 2 ⟩ t 0 = Γ t β , where Figure 3 .

Only trajectories with at least ten time points are included to ensure sufficient statis - tics for comparison . d , Single - locus MSDs for all genomic separations ( color code corresponds to Fig . 2a ) . Single - locus MSDs are calculated by estimating 3D MSDs from motion - corrected trajectories in the xy - plane of the system ( Sup - plementary Section S3 ) . Open data points correspond to a shorter imaging time interval ∆ t = 5 . 4s ( s = 149 kb ) . e , Single - locus MSDs comparing enhancer ( blue ) and promoter ( green ) fluctuations ( s = 149 kb ) . f , Single - locus MSDs com - paring fluctuations in the three states ( s = 149 kb ) . r i ( t ) is the 3D position of the locus , Γ the diffusivity , and β the dynamic exponent . This exponent quantifies how locus diffusion scales with time and can be related theo - retically to the packing of the chromosome via the fractal dimension d : β = 2 / ( 2 + d ) [ 37 , 39 , 53 ] . While the ideal chain model predicts β = 1 / 2 [ 33 ] , we expect β = 2 / 5 for a crumpled polymer [ 37 ] . Our system shows a scaling exponent of β = 0 . 52 ± 0 . 04 across genomic separations ( error bar : std . calculated from total variance across separations ) , for both the endogenous eve locus ( blue ) and for the ectopic reporter ( green ) , which is close to the prediction of the ideal chain model , and consistent with previous works [ 26 , 27 , 35 ] ( Fig . 3d , e ) . Notably , our data further indicate that the single - locus dynamics are not affected by transcriptional activity , unlike previ - ous accounts [ 42 ] , as they are consistent across the three topological states ( Fig . 3f ) . To further understand how the locus dynamics are de - termined by the interplay of chromosome organization 5 and single - locus dynamics , we analyze the joint dynamics of the two coupled chromosomal loci . From the statistics of the 3D distance vector R ( t ) , we compute the two - locus MSD M 2 ( t ) = ⟨ ( R ( t 0 + t ) − R ( t 0 ) ) 2 ⟩ t 0 [ 26 ] , which quan - tifies the crossover between two intuitive regimes . While at small time - lags , the MSD is determined by the in - dependent diffusion of the two loci ( M 2 ( t ) = 2Γ t β ) , it exhibits a cross - over to a plateau at large times , given by the average squared inter - locus distance ( M 2 ( t ) = 2 ⟨ R 2 ⟩ ) ( Fig . ? ? a , b ) . Consistent with the observed single - locus dynamics , we find that also the small - time limit of the ex - perimental two - locus MSDs exhibits an exponent close to the ideal chain with 1 / 2 ( Fig . ? ? a ) . Similarly , for large time - lags , the two - locus auto - correlation reveals agree - ment with the ideal chain scaling ( Fig . ? ? c , d ) . Thus , the full time - dependence of the MSD is well described by the ideal chain predictions , both for single and coupled loci . Inter - locus relaxation times exhibit an anoma - lous scaling with genomic separation . Having estab - lished the static and dynamic properties of the system , we now ask about the consequences of these features for the time scales of the two - locus search process . This pro - cess is determined by the interplay of chromosome dy - namics and organization and can be characterized by a relaxation time τ , which corresponds to the time scale of the crossover of the two regimes of the two - locus MSD ( Fig . ? ? a ) . Specifically , τ is the time taken by the two loci to diffuse ( dynamics ) over their typical distance of separation ( organization ) : Γ τ β ∼ s 2 / d . This relationship predicts a scaling of relaxation times with genomic sep - aration τ ∼ s γ : for ideal chains with fractal dimension d = 2 and a diffusion exponent β = 1 / 2 , this yields the classical result γ = 2 . In contrast , for crumpled chains , β = 2 / 5 and d = 3 , yielding γ = 5 / 3 . To infer the relaxation time in our data as a func - tion of genomic separation , we perform a Bayesian fit - ting of the two - locus MSD with the ideal chain expres - sion [ 26 ] ( Supplementary Section S4 ) . Interestingly , we find that the fitted two - locus diffusion coefficient in - creases with genomic separation up to 595 kb , with an approximate scaling Γ ( s ) ∼ s 0 . 27 ± 0 . 03 ( Fig . ? ? e ) . This scaling appears to plateau for the largest genomic separa - tion ( 3 . 3Mb ) at a value close to the single locus diffusion , which remains approximately constant across separations ( Fig . ? ? e ) . Notably , the absolute value of the diffusivity at the plateau is almost 20 - fold larger than previous mea - surements in mammalian stem cells with similar genomic separation [ 26 ] , suggesting comparatively fast chromo - some dynamics ( Fig . S23 ) . To infer the relaxation time as a function of genomic separation , we combine our estimate of the two - locus dif - fusivity with the average inter - locus distances . Due to the combination of static and dynamic exponents in our system , as well as the scale - dependent diffusivity , we find an anomalous relaxation time scaling with an exponent γ = 0 . 7 ± 0 . 2 ( Fig . ? ? f ) . This exponent corresponds to a much shallower scaling with separation than predicted by either the ideal or crumpled chain theory . This result is further confirmed by a data collapse of the two - locus auto - correlation functions ( Fig . ? ? d , Fig . S20 ) . While these results are derived from the trajectories in the O off state , they are insensitive to the details of the state in - ference ( Fig . S11 ) . In sum , the key result here is that the relaxation time , which sets the time scale of two - locus encounters is much less dependent on genomic separation than predicted by existing polymer models . Anomalous relaxation time scaling induces long - ranged velocity correlations . The anoma - lous relaxation time scaling makes a key prediction for the correlations of the absolute motion of DNA loci , quantified by the velocity cross - correlation C ( δ ) vv ( t ) = ⟨ v ( δ ) i ( t 0 ) · v ( δ ) j ( t 0 + t ) ⟩ t 0 . These correlations are deter - mined by the relaxation time through the dimension - less ratio δ / τ , where δ is the experimental observation time - scale ( Fig . ? ? g ) [ 54 ] . Having determined the relax - ation times τ , we can therefore make a parameter - free prediction of the correlations , which decay significantly more slowly than for the ideal Rouse model ( Fig . ? ? h , green and grey lines ) . Notably , we find that the exper - imental correlations are quantitatively captured by this parameter - free prediction ( Fig . ? ? h ) , including the full time - dependence of the correlations ( Fig . S22 ) . This demonstrates that the anomalous relaxation time scaling indeed leads to long - ranged velocity cross - correlations of chromosomal loci , pointing towards potential long - range interactions . Discussion . We developed an experimental approach to perform in vivo imaging of the joint dynamics of enhancer – promoter pairs with varying genomic separa - tion and simultaneous monitoring of their transcriptional output . Observing the dynamics of pairs of DNA loci has only become possible recently and has been done for tagged DNA loci at a single fixed genomic separa - tion [ 8 , 26 , 27 , 36 ] . Here , we show how imaging across genomic separations gives insight into the relative mo - tion , dynamic encounters , and transcriptional activation of such loci . Many features of the two - locus dynamics , including the subdiffusive exponent close to 0 . 5 , are very well conserved with measurements of CTCF sites at TAD boundaries in mammalian systems [ 26 , 27 ] , despite CTCF not being essential for Drosophila embryogenesis [ 55 ] . In absolute numbers , however , our measurements reveal strikingly large diffusion coefficients of DNA loci , around 20 - fold larger than in mammalian cells [ 26 ] ( Fig . S23 ) . Early fly development follows an extremely tight schedule , sug - gesting that the chromosome dynamics may have evolved to operate on much faster time scales than mammalian systems . In contrast , the median lifetime of focal con - tacts in our system of ( 12 ± 5 ) min is well within the range of typical CTCF loop lifetimes of 10 − 30 min in mammalian cells [ 26 , 27 ] . These time scales facilitate transcriptional lifetimes of ( 10 ± 5 ) min in our system , which in the absence of the homie insulator are reduced to ( 4 . 9 ± 1 . 2 ) min , highlighting the importance of focal elements for contact formation in Drosophila . 6 Figure 4 .

Indeed , we find that the lifetimes of the unpaired O off state correlate well with the relaxation times , but are approximately 10 times larger on average ( Fig . S16 ) . While the absolute values of these unpaired lifetimes depend on the biochemical properties of the fo - cal elements , the relaxation time sets a lower bound and determines the dependence on genomic separation . We demonstrate how key features of our system – tight crumpled chain packing , subdiffusion with exponent 0 . 5 , and a separation - dependent two - locus diffusivity – lead to relaxation times that are much less dependent on genomic separation than predicted by existing polymer models . Indeed , for an ideal Rouse polymer , the relax - ation time for our largest genomic separation ( 3 . 3 Mb ) would be ∼ 3000 times longer than for the shortest 58 kb separation . Our measurements however reveal that it only takes ∼ 20 times longer , corresponding to a more than 100 - fold reduction . This reduced dependence on dis - tance implies that the probability of reaching and main - taining the spatial proximity required for transcription is similar for enhancers dispersed across the chromosome , allowing them to find their target promoter efficiently . This might be one of the reasons for why evolution can act on distal sequences from a given target promoter . Overall , our findings have crucial implications for the spatiotemporal organization of the cell nucleus , includ - ing the dynamics of long - range focal contacts [ 28 ] and mammalian enhancer - promoter interactions [ 9 – 12 , 43 ] . From a polymer physics perspective , our measured ex - ponents suggest that the relationship between static and dynamic properties in the generalized Rouse framework , which relies on the assumption of local friction , does not apply to chromosomes . This suggests that long - range interactions , such as hydrodynamics or active motor - mediated interactions [ 56 , 57 ] could play a role . Indeed , the simplest polymer model that relaxes the Rouse as - sumption and includes long - range hydrodynamic inter - actions , the Zimm model [ 33 ] , predicts a scaling relation - ship of relaxation times with genomic separations with an exponent of γ = 1 , which is close to our measured value of γ ≈ 0 . 7 . Furthermore , the observed separation - dependent diffusivity points to additional heterogeneities along the polymer . Such heterogeneities could be due to a number of processes , such as cross - linking [ 40 ] , out - of - equilibrium activity [ 57 ] , entanglements [ 58 ] , or the presence of condensates [ 18 – 20 ] . Together , these pro - cesses may orchestrate the anomalous scaling of relax - ation times with genomic separation . In future work , the mechanistic underpinnings of our findings should be tested through polymer simulations [ 32 , 40 , 51 , 59 – 64 ] to generate hypotheses for new sets of experiments .
