Osteonecrosis of the femoral head ( ONFH ) is a disorder that can cause collapse of the femoral head . The damage and dysfunction of femoral head microvascular endothelial cells are related to the pathogenesis of glucocorticoid - induced ONFH . Reports suggest that vitamin B 2 can promote osteoblast di ﬀ erentiation and prevent low bone mineral density and prevent reperfusion oxidative injury . To explore the e ﬀ ect and possible molecular mechanism of vitamin B 2 on the ONFH and Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells ( HUVECs ) , we performed a rat model of ONFH by dexamethasone . The rats were randomly divided into four groups : control group , vitamin B 2 group , dexamethasone group , and dexamethasone combined with vitamin B 2 treatment group . HUVECs were used to further prove the role and mechanism of vitamin B 2 in vitro . In patients , according to immunohistochemical and qRT - PCR of the femoral head , the angiogenic capacity of the ONFH femoral head is compromised . In vivo , it showed that vitamin B 2 could inhibit glucocorticoid - induced ONFH - like changes in rats by suppressing cell apoptosis , promoting the regeneration of blood vessels , and increasing bone mass . According to in vitro results , vitamin B 2 could induce the migration of HUVECs , enhance the expression of angiogenesis - related factors , and inhibit glucocorticoid - induced apoptosis . The underlying mechanism may be that vitamin B 2 activates the PI3K signaling pathway . Vitamin B 2 alleviated dexamethasone - induced ONFH , and vitamin B 2 could promote the proliferation and migration of HUVECs and inhibit their apoptosis by activating the PI3K / Akt signaling pathway . Vitamin B 2 may be a potentially e ﬀ ective treatment for ONFH . 1 . Introduction Osteonecrosis of the femoral head ( ONFH ) is a common cause of hip disability among the middle - aged , with bilateral necrosis in 30 to 70 percent of cases , which severely a ﬀ ects patients ’ life and places a burden on public health ﬁ nance [ 1 , 2 ] . Clinically , glucocorticoid ( GC ) administration is con - sidered the most common cause of ONFH , as 9 to 40 percent of patients treated with glucocorticoids experience ONFH [ 3 , 4 ] . Speci ﬁ cally , a reduced number of blood vessels and reduced blood supply are considered important mechanisms of ONFH [ 5 ] . Presently , nonsurgical treatments for this dis - ease include load protection , drug treatment , and physical therapy [ 6 ] . However , the e ﬀ ects of these conservative treat - ments are uncertain . Currently , surgery is still the main treatment option . GC induced thrombosis , endothelial cell dysfunction and damage , and endothelial cell apoptosis , which leads to the development of ONFH [ 7 ] . Previous research has estab - lished that angiogenesis and osteogenesis are closely related [ 8 ] . Moreover , GC inhibits the activity of osteoblasts and osteocytes and decreases the number of blood vessels in bones , together leading to bone loss [ 9 ] . GC inhibited angio - genesis in bone and inhibited HIF - 1 α transcription and VEGF production in osteoblasts and osteocytes . GC inhibits the expression of VEGF , which is one of the key growth fac - tors regulating vascular development and angiogenesis . VEGF directly regulates the di ﬀ erentiation and function of HindawiBioMed Research International Volume 2022 , Article ID 4006184 , 12 pages https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1155 / 2022 / 4006184 osteoblasts and osteoclasts [ 10 , 11 ] . VEGF also exerts direct e ﬀ ects on osteoblasts via BMP produced by endothelial cells [ 12 ] . Therefore , drugs that can promote blood vessel forma - tion would be promising for the treatment of ONFH . Vitamin B 2 in form of ﬂ avin adenine dinucleotide ( FAD ) and ﬂ avin mononucleotide ( FMN ) participates in redox reactions in the metabolic pathways that are involved in energy production [ 13 , 14 ] . Perumal et al . demonstrated that lipid peroxidation and reperfusion oxidative injury of mito - chondria were possibly prevented by vitamin B 2 [ 15 ] . In a model of hepatocyte ischemia / reperfusion injury , vitamin B 2 attenuates tissue oxidative / nitrosative stress and in ﬂ am - matory in ﬁ ltration and exerts antioxidants and e ﬀ ects after hepatic ischemia / reperfusion , reducing the damage of hepa - tocytes [ 16 ] . Moreover , vitamin B 2 showed a protective e ﬀ ect in lipopolysaccharide - induced lung injury in rats [ 17 ] . Cheung et al . showed that vitamin B 2 promotes the synthesis of normal extracellular matrix and reduces reactive oxygen species levels in keratoconus [ 18 ] . Vitamin B 2 has an addi - tive e ﬀ ect on osteoblast di ﬀ erentiation induced by ascorbic acid and β - glycerophosphate , in which the expression of osteoblast transcription factors ( Runx2 and β - catenin ) is upregulated [ 19 ] . Several lines of evidence suggest that ade - quate intake of vitamin B 2 can promote osteoblast di ﬀ eren - tiation and prevent low BMD [ 20 , 21 ] . Interruption of blood supply is a direct cause of ONFH disease , and vascular endothelial cell injury seriously a ﬀ ects the course of ONFH . It would be interesting if we could protect the vascular endo - thelial cells by medication and save the ONFH patient from surgery . Thus , we hypothesize that vitamin B 2 can protect the head of femur from GC damage . Due to the interconnection of angiogenesis and osteo - genesis , as well as the physiological function of vitamin B 2 , we investigated whether vitamin B 2 can rescue the fate of ONFH in GC - treated rats in vivo . At the same time , we also researched whether vitamin B 2 inhibits apoptosis and increases angiogenesis with or without GC treatment HUVECs . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Processing of Human Samples . The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the First A ﬃ liated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University . Written informed consent was obtained from each donor and approved by the Institutional Review of the First A ﬃ liated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University . Our study included 5 ONFH patients and 5 femoral neck fracture ( FNF ) patients . The inclusion criteria of ONFH patients were as follows : ( 1 ) X - ray , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , and pathological ﬁ ndings consistent with a diagnosis of ONFH ; ( 2 ) levels 3 or 4 disease according to the association research circulation osseous ( ARCO ) ; and ( 3 ) patients on high doses ( > 3 g cumulative ) of glucocorti - coids . The inclusion criteria of FNF patients were X - ray , MRI , and histologic section diagnosis of femoral neck frac - ture and no history of medication or surgical treatment within one year . The exclusion criteria for both groups were as follows : patients with a severe endogenous disease such as Paget ’ s disease , metabolic bone disease , metastatic bone can - cer , or hyperparathyroidism . And all patients are in the same age group . 2 . 2 . Cell Culture . Human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) were purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chi - nese Academy of Sciences . HUVECs were cultured in Ros - well Park Memorial Institute ( RPMI ) 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Gibco , Grand Island , USA ) , penicillin ( 100 U / ml ) , and streptomycin ( 100 μ g / ml ) at 37 ° C in 5 % CO 2 . Dexamethasone was administered at a con - centration of 100 μ M for the apoptosis experiment and 20 μ M for the other cell experiments . The concentration of vitamin B 2 administered to the cells was 20 μ M . 2 . 3 . In Vivo Studies . The animal experiments were per - formed in accordance with a previous study [ 22 ] . In brief , forty healthy 8 - week - old female Sprague - Dawley ( S - D ) rats weighing 140 to 160 g were randomly divided into a control group , vitamin B 2 group ( VB 2 ) , dexamethasone group ( DEX ) , and dexamethasone combined with vitamin B 2 treat - ment group ( DEX + VB 2 ) , with 10 rats in each group . The rats in the control group were intramuscularly injected with PBS . The rats in the vitamin B 2 group were intramuscularly injected with vitamin B 2 ( 3 mg / kg / day ) on the ﬁ rst three days of each week for 4 weeks . The rats in the dexametha - sone group were intramuscularly injected with dexametha - sone ( 20 mg / kg / d ) for the ﬁ rst three days of each week for the same time duration . In the DEX + VB 2 group , the rats were intramuscularly injected with dexamethasone and vita - min B 2 for the ﬁ rst three days of each week for the same dura - tion . Two months after treatment , the rats were sacri ﬁ ced , and the femoral heads were isolated for microcomputed tomogra - phy ( micro - CT ) examination and immunohistochemical staining . The investigators who performed micro - CT and immunohistochemistry were unaware of group assignments during the experiment and data analysis . Micro - CT ( Skyscan1174 , Bruker , Belgium ) scans of the rat femoral heads were obtained . At the end of the scanning , N - Recon software was used for three - dimensional recon - struction of the femoral head , and CT - AN software was used to analyze the osteogenic parameters BV / TV , Tb . N , Tb . Th , and Tb . Sp ( BV / TV : bone volume per tissue volume ; Tb . N : trabecular number ; Tb . Th : trabecular thickness ; Tb . Sp , tra - becular separation ) . 2 . 4 . Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) and TUNEL Staining . Femoral head samples were obtained from patients at the Department of Orthopedics , the First A ﬃ liated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University , and rats . We assessed angio - genic di ﬀ erentiation in necrotic areas of bone tissue of ONFH , and the control specimens were obtained from the same areas . In the IHC staining assay [ 23 ] , para ﬃ n sections were defatted with xylene , boiled in citrate bu ﬀ er ( pH 6 . 0 ) for 15 min , incubated with 3 % H 2 O 2 for 25 min at room temperature in the dark to block endogenous peroxidase , and blocked with normal goat serum . Then , the sections were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 ° C in a humidi ﬁ ed chamber . After being washed , tissues 2 BioMed Research International were covered with secondary antibody ( HRP labeled ) and incubated for 50min at room temperature . TUNEL staining was performed as previously described [ 24 ] , the TDT enzyme , dUTP , and bu ﬀ er in the TUNEL kit according mix at 1 : 5 : 50 ratio at 37 ° C for 60min . Reagent streptavidin - HRP is added to cover the tissue and incubated at 37 ° C for 30minutes . Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI . Stained tissue was visualized under a Nikon E100 micro - scope ( Nikon DS - U3 , Japan ) . 2 . 5 . CCK - 8 Assay . Cell Counting Kit - 8 ( CCK - 8 , MCE , USA ) was used to estimate cell proliferation . As previously reported [ 25 ] , HUVECs were plated in 96 - well plates at a density of 5 × 10 3 cells / well and processed in groups , with three duplicate wells in each group . When the growth and fusion degree reached 70 - 80 percent , the cells were treated according to these groups and incubated for 24 , 48 , or 72 h . The corresponding reagents were added according to the instructions of CCK - 8 detection kit , and the absorbance ( D ) value of each well at 450 nm was detected on a micro - plate reader . 2 . 6 . RNA Isolation and Quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) . Total RNA was puri ﬁ ed from human femoral head tissue , rat fem - oral head tissue , and HUVECs using TRIzol ( Invitrogen , USA ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions [ 26 ] . cDNA was generated from the total RNA extracted from tis - sues or cells with a reverse transcription reaction kit ( TAKARA , Japan ) . The cDNA was used as a template for subsequent qPCR assays . The forward and reverse primers used in this study are shown in Table 1 . 2 . 7 . Wound Healing Assay . A wound healing assay was per - formed as described previously [ 27 ] . The cells were plated in 6 - well plates . When the cells reached 100 % con ﬂ uence , a scratch was made through the cell layer . The nonadherent cells were removed with PBS . The remaining adherent cells were incubated with serum - free medium in the presence or absence of vitamin B 2 and dexamethasone to allow cell growth and wound healing . Every 12h , the cells were photo - graphed with a phase contrast microscope ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) . 2 . 8 . Cell Apoptosis Assay . Cell apoptosis was analyzed by ﬂ ow cytometry [ 28 ] . The cells were incubated in serum - free medium in the presence or absence of vitamin B 2 and dexamethasone for 72 h . The cells were digested with 0 . 05 % EDTA - free trypsin , collected , and washed with PBS twice . The cells were stained with staining Annexin V - FITC ( BD Pharmingen , USA ) and propidium iodide ( BD Pharmingen , USA ) . The cells were incubated at room tem - perature for 20 min , and the cell apoptosis rate was assessed on ﬂ ow cytometer . 2 . 9 . Western Blot Assay . Protein expression levels were mea - sured by Western blotting [ 29 ] . Brie ﬂ y , protein was extracted with RIPA lysis bu ﬀ er ( Beyotime , China ) , and the total protein concentration was determined with a Bicinchoninic Acid ( BCA ) Protein Assay Kit ( Beyotime , China ) . After electrophoresis , the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene di ﬂ uoride ( PVDF ) membrane ( Millipore Corporation , USA ) , which was blocked in 5 % fat - free milk powder ( Boster Biological Technology , China ) for 60min at room temperature . The PVDF membrane was incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 ° C . Next , the mem - brane was washed in TBST and incubated with secondary antibodies for 60 min . Primary antibodies against PI3K ( 1 : 1000 , Abcam ) , p - PI3K ( 1 : 1000 , Abcam ) , AKT ( 1 : 1000 , Abcam ) , p - AKT ( 1 : 1000 , Abcam ) , VEGF ( 1 : 1000 , Wanlei - bio ) , VWF ( 1 : 1000 , Wanleibio ) , CD31 ( 1 : 1000 , Wanleibio ) , and GAPDH ( Abcam , 1 ; 2000 ) were used .

Statistical Analysis . All experiments were performed in triplicate , and the experimental data are presented as mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) . We applied one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and Student ’ s t - test to analyze the data for each group . Di ﬀ erences were considered statistically sig - ni ﬁ cant when P values < 0 . 05 . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Diminished Angiogenesis Capacity in the Femoral Head of ONFH Patients . The general shapes of femoral heads are shown in Figure 1 ( a ) , the image on the left shows the femo - ral head of a femoral neck fracture ( FNF ) patient , and the image on the right shows the femoral head of a patient with ONFH . In Figure 1 ( b ) , the X - ray image shows a change in femoral head density and narrowing of the joint space . In Figure 1 ( c ) , the MRI image shows a subchondral fracture with low signal strength . Angiogenesis plays an important role in bone development and regeneration . Thus , we assessed angiogenic di ﬀ erentiation in necrotic areas of bone tissue of ONFH patients , and fracture specimens were obtained from the corresponding areas . Immunohistochem - ical images showed that the expression of VEGF , critical markers of angiogenesis , was notably decreased in ONFH bone tissue ( Figure 1 ( d ) ) . Meanwhile , the qPCR results showed that the mRNA levels of VEGF , CD31 , VWF , ANGPT1 , and EMCN were signi ﬁ cantly decreased in ONFH bone tissue compared with FNF bone tissue ( Figure 1 ( e ) ) . In summary , these data suggested that vasculogenic capacity was impaired in the femoral heads of ONFH patients . 3 . 2 . Vitamin B 2 Facilitates Bone Formation of Femoral Head In Vivo . To assess the e ﬀ ect of vitamin B 2 on bone mass and angiogenesis in vivo , the rats were treated according to the corresponding protocol for 8 weeks to establish an ONFH model [ 22 ] . Three - dimensional micro - CT images showed that the rat model of ONFH was successfully established . Analysis of the femoral head showed that 60 % of the rats injected with dexamethasone developed trabecular changes , including decreased bone volume , trabecular number , and trabecular thickness , an increase in trabecular separation ( Figure 2 ( a ) ) . However , the trend of the dexamethasone - induced decrease in bone mass was rescued by vitamin B 2 ( Figure 2 ( b ) ) . The immunohistochemical images showed that the expression of OCN signi ﬁ cantly declined in the DEX group , showing that dexamethasone inhibits bone FNF ONFH Necrostic zone ( a ) ( b ) Fracture of subchondral ( c ) ONFH FNF VEGF 10 𝜇 m 40 𝜇 m 10 𝜇 m 40 𝜇 m ( d ) m R N A 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 ANGPT1 0 0 . 05 0 . 1 VEGF 0 0 . 25 0 . 5 CD31 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 EMCN 0 0 . 06 0 . 12 VWF FNF ONFH ⁎ ⁎ ⁎ ⁎ ⁎ ( e ) Figure 1 : Diminished vasculogenic capacity in the femoral heads of ONFH patients .

These data suggested that vitamin B 2 probably limits the dexamethasone - induced impairment of osteogenesis in vivo . 3 . 3 . Vitamin B 2 Facilitates Angiogenesis of Femoral Head In Vivo .

Consistent with this ﬁ nding , the qPCR results showed that the expression of VEGF , CD31 , VWF , EMCN , and ANGPT1 was signi ﬁ cantly downregulated in the DEX group and that vitamin B 2 restored the expression of angiogenesis factors to some extent ( Figure 3 ( b ) ) TUNEL staining revealed many more apoptotic cells in the DEX group than in the other groups and showed that vitamin B 2 inhibited dexamethasone - induced apoptosis to some extent ( Figure 3 ( c ) ) .

We also observed the e ﬀ ect of dexamethasone on the apo - ptosis of cells in femoral head tissue . 3 . 4 . Vitamin B 2 Promotes the Proliferation and Migration and Inhibits Apoptosis of HUVECs . CCK8 results showed that the proliferation ability of HUVECs was enhanced with increasing vitamin B 2 concentration in a certain concentra - tion range . When vitamin B 2 treatment concentration was 20 μ mol / L , the proliferation ability of HUVECs was stron - gest ( Figure 4 ( a ) ) . Dexamethasone signi ﬁ cantly inhibited the proliferation ability of HUVECs , and the proliferation ability of HUVECs in the DEX + VB 2 group was partially restored compared with the DEX group ( Figure 4 ( b ) ) . The above results suggested that dexamethasone inhibited the proliferation of HUVECs , and vitamin B 2 could partially restore the dexamethasone - induced decrease in the prolifer - ation of HUVECs . The wound healing assay showed that after 72h , few cells in the DEX group migrated and that more cells migrated in the DEX + VB 2 group than in the DEX group ( Figures 4 ( c ) and 4 ( d ) ) . This result indicated that vitamin B 2 prevented the inhibitory e ﬀ ect of dexameth - asone on HUVEC migration .

The results showed that apoptosis of HUVECs was triggered by dexamethasone and that vitamin B 2 markedly reversed dexamethasone - induced apoptosis ( Figures 4 ( e ) and 4 ( f ) ) . 3 . 5 . Mechanisms of Vitamin B 2 Rescue the Impaired Angiogenic Function in ONFH . To explore potential mech - anisms by which vitamin B 2 rescues the impaired angio - genic function in ONFH , the qPCR and Western blot were performed . This e ﬀ ect of vitamin B 2 was further con - ﬁ rmed by its ability to reverse the change in the expression of angiogenesis - related genes VEGF , CD31 , ANGPT1 , and VWF , which was downregulated by dexamethasone alone ( Figure 5 ( a ) ) . Consistent with the above results , Western blot analysis con ﬁ rmed that vitamin B 2 could restore the expres - sion of VEGF , CD31 , and VWF in dexamethasone - treated HUVECs ( Figure 5 ( b ) ) . The PI3K / AKT pathway is known to play a key role in numerous cellular functions including proliferation , migration , and metabolism [ 30 ] . The PI3K / AKT pathway induces VEGF mRNA transcription and VEGF protein expression which stimulates the formation of blood vessels [ 31 ] . The results con ﬁ rmed that dexameth - asone inhibited the levels of p - PI3K , p - Akt , and VEGF , and dexamethasone combined with vitamin B 2 treatment group increased the expression of p - PI3K , p - Akt , and VEGF which resulted in the activation of the PI3K / Akt signaling pathway ( Figure 5 ( c ) ) . The Western blot results revealed that mechanistically , the PI3K / Akt pathway is important for migration , apoptosis , and expression of angiogenesis - related factors in HUVECs and that vitamin B 2 is vital in activating this pathway . 4 . Discussion ONFH is a common refractory disease in orthopedics , which a ﬀ ects millions of people in China [ 32 ] . In the United States , its incidence is estimated at 15 , 000 - 20 , 000 new cases per year [ 33 ] . Osteonecrosis is characterized by bone cell death due to impaired blood supply to the bones , and osteonecro - sis is most common in the femoral head [ 34 ] . The microen - vironment of ONFH is closely related to cell proliferation , apoptosis , osteogenic di ﬀ erentiation , and angiogenesis [ 35 ] . Seguin et al . [ 36 ] showed that ONFH is strongly associated with regional endothelial dysfunction . And vascular endo - thelial cells play an important role in maintaining this microenvironment . Moreover , previous in vivo and in vitro experiments have provided large amounts of evidence that GC inhibits angiogenesis while also decreasing bone forma - tion and increasing bone resorption [ 5 ] . In this study , vita - min B 2 was found to reduce the negative e ﬀ ects of dexamethasone on angiogenesis - related cytokine expression , bone formation , and apoptosis in vivo experiments . Numerous studies have suggested that vitamin B 2 pre - vents oxidative damage by peroxidation and reperfusion and can promote osteoblast di ﬀ erentiation and treat osteo - porosis [ 37 ] . Vitamin B 2 is a water - soluble vitamin , and ribo ﬂ avin transporter assists its entry into cells [ 38 ] . Vitamin B 2 has an additive e ﬀ ect on ascorbic acid , and β - glycero - phosphate induced osteogenic di ﬀ erentiation of MC3T3 - E1 cells , which is characterized by enhanced alkaline phospha - tase activity and promotion of osteogenic di ﬀ erentiation [ 19 ] . However , these studies have mainly focused on the e ﬀ ect of vitamin B 2 on osteoporosis , and there are few stud - ies related to ONFH . At present , research on ONFH mainly focuses on the balance between osteoblast and osteoclast production [ 39 ] . However , femoral head tissue contains a variety of cells , such as mesenchymal stem cells , osteoblasts , and vascular endo - thelial cells . In the skeletal system , the vascular system is critical for bone development and remodeling and is essen - tial for maintaining healthy bone tissue . Dysregulation of bone - vascular interactions underlies di ﬀ erent pathologies [ 40 , 41 ] . Previous studies have suggested that ONFH is related to angiogenesis - osteogenesis coupling [ 42 , 43 ] . GC - induced ONFH is closely associated with dysfunction of bone microvascular endothelial cells ( BMECs ) , and dysfunc - tion of BMECs ultimately leads to reduced local blood ﬂ ow to the femoral head and is thought to be the cause of GC - induced ONFH [ 44 ] . VEGF receptor 2 antibody can induce ONFH in the rat with a high incidence [ 45 ] . Xu et al . [ 6 ] demonstrated that enhancing VEGF - mediated angiogenesis and inhibiting apoptosis prevent bone loss in mouse ONFH . VEGF regulates the proliferation , migration , and vascularization of endothelial cells and is a key inducer of angiogenesis [ 46 ] . Maes et al . [ 47 ] suggested that VEGF binds angiogenesis and osteoblastic di ﬀ erentiation through its e ﬀ ects on endothelial cells and regulation of osteoblasts , both of which express VEGF receptors . In our study , mRNA and protein expression of both VEGF and CD31 vascular - related genes were substantially higher in the DEX + VB 2 group compared to the DEX group , and VB 2 alone also enhanced their expression , in vivo and in vitro . Further - more , using immunohistochemical techniques , we observed more vessels with endothelial marker expression in rats with GC and VB 2 administration , which further a ﬃ rmed our hypothesis . Endothelial cells can direct osteogenic di ﬀ erentiation of stem cells by activating AKT signaling pathway [ 48 ] . In our study , it was further demonstrated that dexamethasone can directly damage endothelial cells , inhibit cell migration , and promote apoptosis , which is consistent with the previ - ous studies [ 44 ] . In addition , studies have con ﬁ rmed that activation of the PI3K / Akt / VEGF signaling pathway pro - motes angiogenesis in renal cell carcinoma [ 49 ] . Li et al . [ 50 ] reported that microRNA - 126 inhibited the function of HUVEC by inhibiting the expression of EGFL7 and down - regulating the PI3K / AKT signaling pathway . And Chen et al . [ 51 ] demonstrated that tectorigenin increased the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt in HUVEC and reduced H 2 O 2 - induced oxidative stress injury . It was found that in HUVEC cells , the protein levels of p - PI3K and p - AKT in the dexamethasone combined with vitamin B 2 treatment group were signi ﬁ cantly higher than those in the dexameth - asone treatment group . The increase in phosphorylated pro - teins is not due to changes in total protein expression , but due to activation of kinases , which can increase the percent - age of phosphorylated proteins . In vitro , these data revealed that the PI3K / Akt pathway is important for migration , 9 BioMed Research International apoptosis , and expression of angiogenesis - related cytokines in HUVECs and that vitamin B 2 is vital in activating this pathway . Interesting , recent studies have found that ONFH is regulated by osteoclasts and microRNAs , not sure if the e ﬀ ects of vitamin B 2 might modulate these activities [ 52 , 53 ] . And more research will be conducted in the future . 5 . Conclusions In this study , an important role of vitamin B 2 was found . In vivo , vitamin B 2 increased bone mass in the femoral head , avoided femoral head collapse , decreased GC - induced bone loss , apoptosis of cells , and increased expression of angiogenesis - related genes . Although it does not fully restore the e ﬀ ects of GC on bone , vitamin B 2 can attenuate the neg - ative e ﬀ ects of dexamethasone on vascular endothelial cells , such as promoting the migration ability of endothelial cells , inhibiting apoptosis , and promoting the expression of angiogenesis - related factors . This study reveals the positive e ﬀ ect of vitamin B 2 on angiogenesis and provides new ideas for clinical treatment of glucocorticoid - induced ONFH .
