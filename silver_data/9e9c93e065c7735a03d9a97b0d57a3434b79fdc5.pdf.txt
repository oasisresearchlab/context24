Brief Communication 1281 The role of Saccharomyces cerevisiae coronin in the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons Richard A . Heil - Chapdelaine , Nguyen K . Tran and John A . Cooper Coronin was originally identified as a cortical protein associated with the actin cytoskeleton in Dictyostelium [ 1 ] . More recent studies have revealed that coronin is involved in actin - based motility , cytokinesis and phagocytosis [ 2 , 3 ] . Here , we describe the identification of a single homolog of coronin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , which we show localizes to cortical actin patches in an actin - dependent manner . Unlike Dictyostelium mutants that lack coronin , yeast strains lacking coronin had no detectable defects in actin - based processes . This may reflect differences in the functions of the actin cytoskeleton in these two organisms . Previous studies have shown that cortical actin may mediate astral microtubule - based movements of the mitotic spindle in S . cerevisiae [ 4 , 5 ] and that , during mitosis in Dictyostelium , the regions of the cell cortex that overlap with astral microtubules become enriched in actin and coronin [ 6 ] . We therefore examined whether yeast lacking coronin had defects in the microtubule cytoskeleton . The mutant strains had increased sensitivity to the microtubule - destabilizing drug benomyl and an increased number of large - budded cells with short spindles . Further examination of microtubule - related processes , including spindle formation , migration of the mitotic spindle to the bud neck , spindle elongation , and translocation of the elongating spindle through the bud neck , failed to reveal any defects in the coronin mutant . Taken together , these results suggest that S . cerevisiae coronin is a component of the actin cytoskeleton that may interact with the microtubule cytoskeleton .

We refer to this gene as CRN1 . No other yeast genes showed any significant level of similarity . The predicted protein , Crn1p , contains 651 amino acids . The first 393 amino acids are very similar to coronins from other organisms ( 70 % similar to Schizosac - charomyces pombe , 48 % similar to Caenorhabditis elegans , 57 % similar to Dictyostelium , and 56 % similar to human ; see Supplementary material published with this paper on the internet ) . This region contains five WD repeats ; these motifs mediate protein – protein interactions [ 7 ] . The amino - terminal region of S . cerevisiae coronin is followed by a central region of 190 amino acids that is rich in proline and charged residues . This central region is also found in C . elegans and S . pombe coronin , but not in human or Dictyostelium coronin . The carboxy - terminal region of S . cerevisiae coronin and all coronins is predicted to have a coiled - coil structure , which is found between amino acids 603 and 651 in S . cerevisiae coronin . The predicted coiled - coil domains are all preceded by a coil - inducing proline residue [ 8 ] , located at amino acid 602 for S . cerevisiae coronin and at homologous positions in the other coronins . A BLAST search of amino acids 394 – 651 of Crn1p identi - fied no strong similarity to any other proteins . S . cerevisiae coronin localizes to cortical actin patches In Dictyostelium and human cells , coronin is a component of the cortical actin cytoskeleton [ 1 , 9 ] . To determine the localization of coronin in S . cerevisiae , we created a fusion protein comprising coronin amino - terminally tagged with green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) . The GFP – coronin fusion protein was observed by fluorescence microscopy to reside in cortical patches that moved in a similar manner as actin patches [ 10 , 11 ] . Rhodamine – phalloidin staining of fixed cells expressing GFP – coronin revealed colocalization of GFP – coronin and filamentous ( F ) - actin in patches at the cell cortex ( Figure 1 ) . This localization is consistent with the localization of Dictyostelium coronin to the cortical actin cytoskeleton [ 1 , 3 ] . Although the relative amounts of GFP – coronin and F - actin in individual patches varied widely , every patch contained both GFP – coronin and F - actin . In other words , no patches contained only GFP – coronin or F - actin . We next determined whether GFP – coronin required F - actin for localization to patches in the cortex of the cell . Depolymerization of F - actin with latrunculin A resulted in the loss of GFP – coronin labeling of patches ( Figure 1 ) . The localization of GFP – coronin to patches therefore depends on F - actin . Coronin mutant phenotype To investigate the function of coronin in S . cerevisiae , we deleted the entire open reading frame of the CRN1 gene by replacement with the HIS3 gene . Disruption was per - formed in a diploid followed by sporulation and dissection of tetrads to isolate haploids . Haploid null mutants were viable and grew as well as wild - type cells in liquid media and on solid media at temperatures ranging from 14°C to 37°C . At 30°C , the doubling time in liquid media was 124 minutes for wild - type cells and 110 minutes for the coronin mutant . Actin - dependent functions Dictyostelium coronin is an actin - binding protein that local - izes to regions of actin polymerization and is involved in cell locomotion , cytokinesis , phagocytosis , endocytosis and macropinocytosis [ 2 , 3 , 12 , 13 ] . We therefore examined the yeast coronin mutant for defects in organization and function of the actin cytoskeleton . We examined the mor - phology of the actin cytoskeleton , polarized growth and secretion , endocytosis , mating projection formation , and bud - site selection ( see Supplementary material ) . Remark - ably , unlike coronin - deficient Dictyostelium , yeast strains lacking coronin were similar to wild - type strains in all of these analyses . If coronin does have a function in the actin cytoskeleton , the role of coronin must be redundant with another component of the actin cytoskeleton . Alterna - tively , actin may hold coronin in the correct place to allow it to carry out its function . Microtubule - dependent functions Actin has been implicated in the migration and positioning of the mitotic spindle in yeast [ 4 ] . The localization of coronin to cortical actin patches and the lack of an actin - based phenotype in the coronin null mutant suggest that coronin may serve as a connection between astral micro - tubules and the cell cortex . To examine possible roles for coronin in microtubule function , coronin mutants were first examined for sensitivity to the microtubule - destabilizing drug benomyl . Coronin mutant strains were slightly more sensitive to benomyl than were wild - type strains ( Figure 2 ) . Microtubules were then observed by fluores - cence microscopy of wild - type and coronin mutant cells containing a GFP – tubulin fusion protein ( GFP – Tub1p ) . In asynchronous log - phase cultures , mutant strains had twice as many large budded cells with small spindles as did wild - type cells . This difference was small but statistically significant ( Figure 3 ) . The increased number of cells with short mitotic spindles suggested a defect in spindle forma - tion or elongation . We tested these processes in two assays using synchronized cells . Coronin mutant strains formed mitotic spindles at the same rate as wild - type strains in cul - tures synchronized with the mating pheromone a - factor ( Figure 4 ) . Coronin mutant strains underwent spindle 1282 Current Biology , Vol 8 No 23 Figure 1 Localization of coronin . GFP - labeled coronin ( green ) localizes to cortical actin patches ( red ) . Cells expressing GFP – coronin ( GFP – CRN1 ) and wild - type cells ( CRN1 ) were stained for F - actin using rhodamine – phalloidin ( Rh – phalloidin ) . The resulting images were merged and colocalization of coronin and F - actin is shown as yellow . Depolymerization of F - actin with latrunculin A ( LatA ) removed coronin from cortical patches ( panels marked + LatA ) . The bar corresponds to 5 m m .

The growth of coronin mutants ( crn1 D ) was more sensitive to the microtubule - destabilizing drug benomyl than that of wild - type cells ( wt ) . Two segregants each of wild - type and coronin mutant cells were spotted at 10 - fold serial dilutions from log - phase cultures onto plates containing increasing concentrations of benomyl and grown for 48 h at 30°C . Two such serial dilutions on 10 , 20 and 30 m g / ml benomyl are shown . Current Biology 10 Benomyl µ g / ml wt crn1 ∆ 20 30 elongation at the same rate as wild - type strains in cultures synchronized in G0 with a - factor ( Figure 4 ) or in S phase with hydroxyurea ( data not shown ) . Yeast lacking the kinesin motor Kip3p have defects in positioning the mitotic spindle at the bud neck [ 14 ] . This positioning presumably requires interactions between astral microtubules and the cell cortex . We examined asynchronous cultures of coronin mutant strains contain - ing GFP – Tub1p for similar defects , but did not find any defects ( data not shown ) . Disrupting the dynein gene in yeast decreases the efficiency of translocating the mitotic spindle through the bud neck during anaphase . This results in large - budded cells with two nuclei in the mother cell [ 14 ] . We assayed synchronized cultures of coronin mutant strains for large - budded cells with two nuclei in the mother cell and found that mutant cells were similar to wild - type cells ( see Supplementary material ) . We next asked whether the microtubule phenotype of the coronin mutant was enhanced by mutations in certain genes that function in mitosis . Kip1p is a kinesin motor that acts within the mitotic spindle to cause spindle elongation [ 15 ] . Dynein also contributes to spindle elongation and helps to position the elongating mitotic spindle through the bud neck coincident with anaphase , presumably by acting on astral microtubules [ 14 , 16 ] . Deletion of ACT5 , a regula - tor of dynein , has the same phenotype as the deletion of dynein [ 17 ] . We isolated crn1 D kip1 D and crn1 D act5 D Brief Communication 1283 Figure 3 Coronin mutant strains have an increased number of large - budded cells with short spindles in asynchronous cultures . Asynchronous cultures of wild - type and coronin mutant cells containing GFP – Tub1p were observed by fluorescence microscopy . The values are the mean percentages ± the standard error of four experiments with three strains of wild - type cells , and five experiments with three strains of coronin mutant cells ( > 200 cells per experiment ) .

Cells containing GFP – Tub1p were synchronized in G0 with a - factor and released . Samples were fixed at 20 min intervals and the spindle formation monitored in > 100 cells per sample . The blue circles connected with solid lines represent three cultures of two separate segregants of wild - type cells . The red squares connected with dashed lines represent two segregants of coronin mutants examined in duplicate . ( a ) For both wild - type and coronin mutants the percentage of cells with mitotic spindles peaked at about 75 min . ( b ) The percentage of cells with elongating spindles ( i . e . entering anaphase ) peaked at around 80 min for both wild - type cells and coronin mutant cells . ( c ) The transition from short spindles to elongating spindles ( i . e . entry into anaphase ) was similar between wild - type and coronin mutant cells . This was measured as a decrease in the percentage of short spindles relative to the number of total mitotic spindles : short , medium and long . 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 Time ( min ) 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 Time ( min ) 0 20 40 60 C e ll s w i t h e l o n g a t i n g s p i n d l e s ( % ) S h o r t s p i n d l e s ( % ) C e ll s w i t h m i t o t i c s p i n d l e s ( % ) 80 100 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 0 20 40 60 80 100 Time ( min ) Current Biology ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) double mutants and assayed them for two coronin pheno - types — the fraction of the population in asynchronous cul - tures that were large - budded cells with short spindles , and sensitivity to benomyl . Neither kip1 D nor act5 D mutants had increased numbers of large - budded cells with short spindles in asynchronous cells and neither enhanced the coronin phenotype when present as double mutants with crn1 D ( data not shown ) . On benomyl , kip1 D grew as well as wild - type cells and crn1 D kip1 D grew similarly to crn1 D , growing more poorly than wild - type cells at 30 m g / ml ( data not shown ) . The crn1 D act5 D double mutant had a similar growth phenotype as the act5 D mutant , growing poorly on benomyl at 20 m g / ml ( data not shown ) . In summary , neither phenotype of crn1 D was enhanced in either double mutant . The lack of an enhanced phenotype coupled with the dis - similarity of the single mutant phenotypes indicates that the process in which coronin functions is distinct from that dependent on Kip1p or dynein . Yeast mutants lacking the microtubule - binding protein EB1 have a modest defect in the early phase of spindle formation and lack the cell - cycle delay associated with loss of dynein [ 18 , 19 ] . We tested whether compromising the early mitotic spindle with the loss of EB1 might enhance the coronin mutant phenotype . A crn1 D eb1 D double mutant showed no increase in benomyl sensitivity or the fraction of large - budded cells with short spindles com - pared to single mutants ( data not shown ) . These data suggest that coronin affects the mitotic spindle in a process independent of EB1 . As an additional test of the function of coronin in mitosis , we determined whether the coronin mutant required the spindle assembly checkpoint for via - bility . Mad1p is a necessary component of the spindle assembly checkpoint [ 20 ] . We crossed a crn1 D mutant with a mad1 mutant and conducted random spore analysis and found that 26 of 47 crn1 D mutants were also mutant for mad1 . This result supports the conclusion that coronin mutants do not have defects in formation of the mitotic spindle that require the spindle assembly checkpoint . The increased benomyl sensitivity and the increase in large - budded cells with short spindles in strains lacking coronin suggests that coronin , a component of the cortical actin cytoskeleton , participates in some microtubule - based process . Coronin may therefore play a role in the interac - tion of microtubules with actin . Such a role , however , is not readily apparent from the number of assays of mitosis and microtubule function that were performed in these studies .

FM4 - 64 and rho - damine – phalloidin were from Molecular Probes . Frozen EZ transforma - tion kit was from Zymo Research . Oligonucleotides were ordered from GIBCO / Life Sciences or IDT . Latrunculin A was a generous gift from Philip Crews , Department of Chemistry , UCSC . KlenTaq was pur - chased from Wayne Barnes ( Washington University ) . Benomyl was a generous gift from Dupont . 35 S - a - factor was a generous gift from Kendall Blumer ( Washington University ) . All other reagents were from Sigma or Fisher . Sequence accession numbers and analysis The following are the GenBank accession numbers for coronins : S . cerevisiae U20939 , S . pombe Z99753 , C . elegans Z31590 , D . dis - coideum X61480 , and H . sapiens X89109 . The S . cerevisiae coronin sequence was originally found by BLAST with tblastn with the Dic - tyostelium protein sequence . The alignment in Figure 1a was per - formed with MegAlign ( DNAStar ) using the J . Hein method and the PAM250 setting . Similarity and identity within the amino - terminal domain was performed with GAP ( GCG ) with the BLOSUM62 setting . The coiled - coil domains were identified with COILS at the ISREC web site , www . isrec . isb . ch / software / COILS _ form . html . Gene disruption The open reading frame for S . cerevisiae coronin ( YLR429W ) was deleted via homologous recombination using a PCR product com - posed of HIS3 with flanking regions immediately outside the CRN1 coding region [ S1 ] . The forward primer sequence was : AGT - GAAAAAGGGATAAAGGATACACTCCACTTAGAAGGGCG - CAAGggcctcctctagtacactc . The first 45 nt ( uppercase ) are identical to the 45 bases immediately upstream of the initiating ATG of CRN1 . The next 19 nt ( lowercase ) are identical to sequence upstream of the HIS3 coding region . The reverse was : TAAAAAGGACTCACTTAATTTTAT - CATTAAAAGTACAAAAAATTTgcgcgcctcgttcagaatg . The first 45 nt reverse complement the 45 nt immediately downstream of the transla - tional stop codon of the CRN1 open reading frame . The following 19 nt are the reverse complement of sequences downstream of the HIS3 gene . The product was transformed into the diploid YJC1411 , and transformants were sporulated to obtain haploid mutants . Genomic DNA from transformants was tested by PCR for the appropri - ate deletion by using a forward primer upstream of the disruption , CTAGTGTCGTTGTGCGTG , and a reverse primer within the HIS3 gene , ATGGCAACCGCAAGAGCCTTG . GFP constructs GFP – TUB1 in plasmid pAFS92 was a gift from Aaron Straight and Andrew Murray [ S2 ] . Ste2 – GFP was a gift from Chris Stefan and Kendall Blumer , Dept . of Cell Biology and Physiology , Washington Uni - versity School of Medicine and was transformed into yeast strains YJC1617 and YJC1622 . One chromosomal copy of CRN1 in strain YJC1617 was tagged with GFP to produce YJC1856 as follows . We amplified by PCR the HIS3 gene followed by the CAP 2 promoter fol - lowed by S65T GFP from plasmid pBJ826 provided by Tatiana Karpova . This plasmid was constructed by inserting an Eco RI fragment of pBJ646 [ S3 ] into pJJ217 [ S4 ] . The forward primer was : AGT - GAAAAAGGGATAAAGGATACACTCCACTTAGAAGGGCG - CAAGggcctcctctagtacactc . The first 45 nt ( uppercase ) are identical to the 45 nt immediately upstream of the initiating ATG of CRN1 . The next 19 nt ( lowercase ) correspond to sequence upstream of the HIS3 gene in the plasmid . The reverse primer was : AAAGACGTGTC - TATATTTAGAAGCACGAACAAATTTTCCACTCATtttgtatagttcatccat - gcc . The first 45 nt ( uppercase ) reverse complement the beginning of the coronin coding region . The next 21 nt ( lowercase ) are the reverse complement of the end of S65T GFP . The oligonucleotides used for testing the deletion were also used for testing proper integration of the GFP PCR product . Assays Cells were grown at 30 o C . Mating projections were induced by adding 2 m M a factor to logarithmically growing cultures diluted to OD 600 = 0 . 1 . To assay mitotic spindle formation and initiation of spindle elongation , two independent haploid CRN1 and crn1 D segregants were transformed with GFP – TUB1 ( YJC1670 , YJC1671 , YJC1672 , YJC1673 ) . For a factor synchronization , cells were grown to OD 600 = 0 . 5 in YPD , and placed at OD 600 = 0 . 1 in 0 . 6 m M a factor in synthetic media lacking methionine to induce the GFP – TUB1 . After 2 h , cells were washed with and resuspended in YPD . At 20 min inter - vals , samples were fixed ( for 20 min ) and then washed with 0 . 1 M KPO 4 , pH7 . 4 , 10 mM ethanolamine at 4 o C . The samples were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy for spindle morphology . Hydroxyurea syn - chronization was conducted similarly using 200 mM hydroxyurea for the 2 h arrest in synthetic media lacking methionine . To assay nuclear segregation , cells ( YJC1617 , YJC1622 ) were synchronized with 200 mM hydroxy urea and released . Samples were fixed in ethanol and stained with DAPI . Endocytosis of lucifer yellow was assayed as described [ S5 ] . FM4 - 64 trafficking was assayed as described [ S6 ] . Receptor - mediated endocytosis of a factor in strains YJC1757 , YJC1758 , YJC1759 , and YJC1760 was measured as described [ S5 ] . Supplementary material S5 Figure S8 Wild - type , act5 D , and crn1 D haploid cells were synchronized with hydroxyurea and released . Cells were fixed at intervals after the release , and the nuclei stained with DAPI . Greater than 200 cells were counted per time point and assayed for normal segregation of nuclei between mother and bud ( open circles ) and for misplaced anaphase resulting in two nuclei within the mother cell ( closed squares ) . The act5 D cells exhibited a peak of large - budded cells with both nuclei in the mother , characteristic of dynein pathway mutants .

Fixed cells were washed with 0 . 1 % TritonX - 100 , 10 mM ethanolamine , 0 . 1M KPO 4 pH7 . 0 and then stained with 0 . 33 m M rhodamine – phal - loidin [ S7 ] . To fix cells for simultaneous visualization of rhodamine – phalloidin and GFP – coronin , cells were fixed as above with the fixation time reduced to 15 min . The cells were then immediately put on ice , washed and stained at 0 o C . These cells were processed in microfuge tubes on ice and never allowed to dry . Cells ( 2 m l ) were placed on a glass slide and covered with a glass coverslip . Images were collected on an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope equipped with an Olympus UPLAN APO 100 · objective ( N .
