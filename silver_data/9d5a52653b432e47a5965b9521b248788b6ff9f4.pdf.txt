A B S T R A C T Objective : To review the available evidence linking stress to asthma and to investigate whether mast cells contribute to the effect of stress through activation by corticotropin - releasing hormone ( CRH ) . Data Source : The PubMed database was searched for articles ( 1998 - 2011 ) using the keywords anxiety , asthma , exacerbation , inﬂammation , mast cells , socioeconomic status , stress , violence , and worsening . Study Selection : Articles were selected based on their relevance to the topic , with emphasis on clinical or epidemiologicdatalinkingstresstoasthmaandstudiesthatofferedpossibleexplanationsforhowstressmay affect asthma . Results : Many articles point to an association between stress ( socioeconomic status , interpersonal conﬂicts , emotional distress , terrorism ) and asthma exacerbations but without any distinct pathogenetic mechanism . A few articles have reported reduced circulating cortisol and / or sensitivity to corticosteroids . We propose that mast cells , known to be involved in the pathophysiology of asthma , can be activated by CRH , which is secreted under stress in the lungs , leading to selective release of proinﬂammatory mediators . This effect may be augmented by neuropeptides or cytokines . CRH also reduces T - regulatory cell production of interleukin 10 , which in known to inhibit allergic mast cell activation . Conclusion : More studies are required to investigate lung levels of CRH and selective mast cell mediators . Reducing stress and using CRH receptor antagonists and / or mast cell blockers may serve as possible new therapeutic approaches for asthma .

Introduction Numerous studies have documented an alarming increase in asthma during the last 20 years 1 but without identifying any dis - tinctive pathogenetic triggers . 2 Worse yet , asthma exacerbations continue to elude any deﬁnitive explanation and constitute the main reason for asthma - related severity and morbidity . 2 , 3 A recent review focused on asthma exacerbations but only included brief mention of “psychological factors / stress . ” 4 Considerable evidence indicates that stress worsens allergic diseases in general 5 – 7 and asthma in particular . 8 , 9 A recent meta - analysis of 43 studies , 90 % of which were on asthma , reported a positive association between psychological factors and atopic dis - orders . 10 Consequently , it is important to attempt to understand how stress inﬂuences asthma exacerbations . It has been proposed that asthma worsening with stress may be due to a dysfunctional hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis , 11 less cortisol production in response to stress in asthmatic patients compared with nonasthmatic controls , 12 , 13 or cortisol in - sensitivity due to chronic psychological stress through impaired glucocorticoid receptor expression or function . 14 Moreover , one study showed that children with asthma who experienced acute and chronic stress had a 5 . 5 - fold reduction in expression of gluco - corticoid receptor messenger RNA ( mRNA ) and 9 . 5 - fold reduction in (cid:1) 2 - andrenoreceptor mRNA expression in the peripheral leuko - cytes , 15 implying that they would be resistant to treatment with the respective drugs . It would be important to extend these ﬁnd - ings to other tissues relevant to asthma . Alternatively , we propose that the effect of stress in asthma may be mediated through activation of mast cells 5 , 16 ( Fig 1 ) by cortico - Reprints : Theoharis C .

However , the timing and chronicity of stress , as well as the quality of stress , could yield different outcomes in patients with asthma . 21 It may , there - fore , be important to identify asthma subphenotypes that may be more susceptible to stress . 22 Quality of life . There was an inverse relationship between the socio - economic status ( as characterized by poverty ) and pulmonary func - tion and lung inﬂammation in children with asthma measured after a laboratory stressor . 23 Living in an emergency shelter also increased the incidence of asthma . 24 High caregiver anxiety associated with immigrant status and low income was also linked to increased risk of developing asthma among wheezing infants , as measured by fre - quency of emergency department visits and hospitalizations . 25 Psychological status of patients . The strongest evidence comes from an association between worsening emotional status of the patient and an increase in the risk of frequency and severity of asthma attacks . One of the ﬁrst studies to document such a rela - tionship followed up a group of children with diagnosed asthma for 18 months . They showed that severe psychological events , such as loss of a caregiver or loss of security due to a divorce , signiﬁcantly increased the risk of an asthma attack within 24 hours if there was also chronic stress . 26 In another prospective study , 32 adults with asthma were followed up for 140 days with daily records , pulmo - nary function tests , and psychological status tests . A signiﬁcant positive correlation was found in 50 % of patients , implying the possible existence of a susceptible subgroup among relationship stress , anxiety , and worsening pulmonary function . 27 A comprehensive study was performed with a postal survey on risk factors for asthma and atopic diseases among Finnish ﬁrst - year university students aged 18 to 25 years . It demonstrated that con - comitant personal conﬂicts increased the risk of asthma , even when adjusted by parental health , education , and passive smoking at an early age . 28 Another study reported that breaking off a life partnership in middle - aged adults led to increased risk of asthma more than twice as much as the general population . 29 A similar relationship was also apparent between patients experiencing panic attacks and asthma . 30 Finally , a study conducted in Russia from 1975 to 2005 showed that there was also a signiﬁcant associ - ation between suicide attempts , as an indicator of stress , and asthma mortality . 31 Fig 1 .

Theoharides et al . / Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 109 ( 2012 ) 14 – 19 15 In an attempt to investigate speciﬁc mechanisms , a study mea - sured peripheral blood mononuclear cell production of proinﬂam - matory cytokines . 32 There was a strong correlation between chil - dren with asthma perceiving low support from their parents , thereby facing greater stress and anxiety , and increased serum levels of interleukin ( IL ) 5 , IL - 6 , and interferon (cid:2) released from peripheral blood mononuclear cells . In another study , airway anti - gen challenge of college students with mild asthma during both a low - stress phase ( midsemester or 2 weeks after ﬁnal examination ) andastressphase ( ﬁnalexaminationweek ) resultedinasigniﬁcant increase in sputum and airway eosinophils , as well as increased eosinophil - derived neurotoxin and IL - 5 levels only during the stress period . 33 Environmental stressors Noise . One multicenter , German study investigated the effect of long - term noise exposure on asthmatic and nonasthmatic 12 - year - oldboysandgirlsandfoundasigniﬁcantassociationbetweennoise annoyance ( particularly at night ) with increased physician - diag - nosed asthma prevalence in girls but not boys . 34 The authors did not suggest any explanation fro these sex - speciﬁc differences . Violence . Increasing reports indicate an association among anger , violence , and asthma worsening . One study involving a telephone survey conducted among Manhattan residents 5 to 9 weeks after the September 11th attacks found that , among the adult respon - dents with asthma , 27 % reported experiencing more severe asthma symptoms after the September 11th attacks , a signiﬁcant increase compared with normal seasonal patterns . 35 In another study inves - tigating violence - associated stress , 45 % of enrollees in Medicaid managedcareresidinginNewYorkCity , whorespondedtoasurvey conducted in 2005 , reported worsened asthma after the September 11th attacks . 36 These results were conﬁrmed by another survey of residents in a 1 - mile area around World Trade Center 2 and 4 years after the September 11th attacks . 37 However , it should be consid - ered that these individuals , especially in the latter study , were exposed to environmental pollution or debris that could have ex - acerbated their asthma . Another study of a large sample of patients in Kuwait , who experienced fear for their lives during the Iraqi invasion , reported diagnosis of asthma more than twice as often as civilians 13 years later . 38 Family or caregiver stressors There has been some evidence that parental stress could exac - erbate other environmental stressors , such as pollution . One study of 2 , 500 children aged 5 to 9 years with new - onset asthma and no prior history of asthma or wheezing 39 were followed up for 3 years , and a signiﬁcant correlation was found between high parental psychosocial stress and the effect of trafﬁc - related pollution for asthma incidence . Another study reported that more than half of inner - city children studied were exposed to second - hand smoke and that such children were at signiﬁcant risk of smoke exposure when their caregivers were depressed or stressed . 40 In a study of twins in Puerto Rico , both paternal and maternal stress increased asthma morbidity in their children . 41 Presence of minor psychiatric disorders in mothers documented using the 20 - item Self - Report Questionnaire ( depression , anxiety , somatic dis - orders , developed by the World Health Organization ) was signiﬁ - cantly associated with the presence of asthma in their children , 34 . 4 % of whom had atopic and 62 . 4 % nonatopic asthma . 42 In an attempt to identify potential mechanisms , one study also found that maternal stress may be responsible for the immune response involved in childhood asthma . 43 Mechanistic explanations for the connection between stress and asthma Large knowledge or data gap In addition to some evidence of a dysfunctional HPA axis , less cortisol production , and decreased sensitivity to corticosteroids mentioned earlier , a recent article reported that allergic asthma was reduced in CRH - / - mice and concluded that it was due to less cortisol production . 44 Interestingly , another recent article reported that CRH reduces the production of IL - 10 from T - regulatory cells 45 in atopic dermatitis and may worsen this condition by reducing the inﬂammatory effect of IL - 10 . IL - 10 is also inhibitory for mast cells , and its reduction will increase IgE - receptor expression and signal - ing . 46 Effect of mast cells on the link between stress and asthma Mast cells are involved in the pathophysiology of asthma . 17 – 20 Mast cells derive from a distinct hemopoietic precursor and mature under local tissue microenvironmental conditions . 47 They are nec - essary for the development of allergic reactions through crosslink - ing of their surface receptors for IgE ( Fc (cid:3) RI ) , 48 leading to degranu - lation and the release of vasoactive , proinﬂammatory , and nociceptive mediators ; these mediators include arachidonic acid metabolites , histamine , proteolytic enzymes , and cytokines , such as IL - 5 , IL - 6 , IL - 13 , and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) . 47 , 49 Cytokines and chemokines elevated in stress . Many mast cell – de - rived mediators participate in asthma . 50 Moreover , some of these , such as histamine 51 and IL - 6 , 52 are increased in response to stress . Mast cells also produce IL - 33 and worsen allergic inﬂamma - tion . 53 , 54 For instance , IL - 33 is considered to participate in the pathogenesis of asthma . 55 IL - 33 56 can also activate mast cells to release proinﬂammatory cytokines , 57 increase their production of IL - 13 , 58 and promote mast cell survival . 58 We showed that IL - 33 augments human mast cell release of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) inresponsetosubstanceP , 59 andmastcellshavebeen considered sensors of cell injury through IL - 33 . 60 In fact , IL - 33 was considered to link dendritic , epithelial , and mast cells in a mouse model of asthma . 61 Mast cell mediators could also stimulate or augment the stress response . Mast cells can release large amounts of CRH , 62 whereas histamine released after mast cell activation has been shown to increase CRH mRNA expression in the hypothalamus . 63 In fact , hypothalamic mast cell activation stimulated the HPA axis . 64 , 65 Selective mast cell mediator release . Asthma is not always of aller - gic origin , 66 prompting the search for other triggers . A unique aspect of mast cell physiology that had been largely ignored in asthma is that they can secrete speciﬁc mediators without degran - ulation in response to a number of nonimmune triggers . 67 As a result , histologicstudiesarenotlikelytoshowevidenceofmastcell activation . For instance , IL - 1 can induce selective release of IL - 6 , 68 and CRH can stimulate selective release of VEGF , which is also proinﬂammatory and vasodilatory . 69 In fact , mast cells were re - cently shown to induce vascular leakage in an Fc (cid:3) RI - independent manner . 70 Moreover , viral polynucleotides can stimulate Toll - like receptor 3 to induce selective release of IL - 13 , 71 whereas bacterial lipopolysaccharide can induce selective release of TNF 72 and IL - 1 . 73 In fact , Toll - like receptors are increasingly invoked in the develop - ment of airway inﬂammation 74 through regulation of mast cell function . 75 Hence , the responsiveness of lung mast cell to such trigger may be affected by stress . In addition to any direct effect of mast cell mediators , there could be additional mast cell – dependent actions . Activated mast cellswerereportedtostimulateTcellsthroughTNF , 47 , 76 whichmay respond inappropriately to bacterial or viral infections known to exacerbateasthma . 77 MastcellscouldalsodeliverTNFtothelymph Theoharides et al . / Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 109 ( 2012 ) 14 – 19 16 nodes , further triggering an immune response . 78 Mast cells also augment adaptive immunity by recruiting dendritic cells 79 and by regulating vascular and lymphatic vessels . 80 Howmastcellsmediatetheeffectofstress . Stresstypicallyresultsin secretion of CRH from the hypothalamus and activates the HPA axis . 81 However , CRHisalsoreleasedoutsidethebrain , whereithas proinﬂammatoryeffects 81 throughmastcellactivation 82 ( Figure1 ) . Some processes active in the lungs may be similar to those that have been described in the skin . For instance , CRH and CRH recep - tors ( CRHRs ) are expressed in human skin , 83 which may have its own equivalent of the HPA axis . 84 Stress induces local release of CRH in the skin 85 and stimulates skin mast cells , 86 leading to in - creased skin vascular permeability . 86 The peptide neurotensin aug - ments the effect of CRH , leading to increased vascular permeability and inﬂammation in rodent skin . 87 CRH also increases vascular permeability in human skin , an effect dependent on CRHR - 1 and mast cells . 88 Moreover , human mast cells express mRNA and pro - tein for CRHR - 1 , 69 activation of which induces selective release of VEGF . 69 Even though the effect of stress is obviously not limited only to lungs , there could be reasons why it may manifest primarily in the lungs . First , CRH , neurotensin , and substance P may be released preferentially in the lungs . Second , lung mast cells may express a higher number of CRHRs , making them more likely to respond to CRH than other tissues . For instance , skin biopsy samples from patients with stress - induced alopecia 89 and urticaria pigmentosa 90 were associated with increased expression of CRHR - 1 . Third , there may be higher expression in the lungs of the structural CRH ana - logues , the urocortins , which also stimulate mast cells . 91 Conclusion Additional studies should measure CRH levels in bronchoalveo - lar lavage ﬂuid and serum , especially because we recently reported that CRH is increased in the serum of patients with atopic derma - titis , 92 which is often comorbid with atopic asthma . 93 , 94 Lung CRHR expression should also be evaluated . Subgroups of asthmatic patients who may respond differently to stressors need to be distinguished . For instance , evidence has indicated an association between genetic polymorphisms with the CRHR1 geneandlungresponsestotreatment . Inparticular , patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with the heterozygous genotype in the minor allele rs242941 in the CRHR - 1 sequence responded worse to inhaled corticosteroids than controls , 95 and asthma patients had lower bronchodilator response to albuterol . 96 However , this polymorphism does not provide information on the function of CRH ; moreover , poor lung function does not necessarily indicate risk of asthma exacerbations . Unfortunately , healthcareprofessionalsrarelyconsiderpsycho - logical support as part of guidelines for asthma treatment . For instance , a study in Germany found that 80 % of general practitio - ners believe that stress plays an important role in the etiology of asthma , but only 11 % refer their patients for psychological help . 97 Increasingevidencesuggeststhatstresscontributessigniﬁcantlyto frequency of exacerbation and / or severity of asthma . We propose thatthemastcellisauniqueimmunecellthatcouldbeactivatedby stress - related triggers and could explain the effect of stress on asthma exacerbations . The multitude of mast cell mediators has given rise to new speculations about the possible role of these cells in inﬂammatory processes . 5 , 98 - 100 Recognizing and reducing stress , possibly through the use of select CRH antagonists , and blocking stress - induced mast cell acti - vation could be important . Future research should focus on the development of effective CRHRs and mast cell inhibitors .
