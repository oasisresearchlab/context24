New ther - apeutic targets are urgently needed to improve patient survival rates . Objective : The proto - oncogene PTTG1 - binding factor ( PBF / PTTG1IP ) is overexpressed in multiple endocrine cancers and circumstantially associated with tumor aggressiveness . This study aimed to understand the role of PBF in tumor cell invasion and identify possible routes to inhibit its action . Design , Setting , Patients , and Interventions : Thyroid , breast , and colorectal cells were transfected with PBF and cultured for in vitro analysis . PBF and cortactin ( CTTN ) expression was determined in differentiated thyroid cancer and The Cancer Genome Atlas RNA - seq data . Primary Outcome Measure : Pro - invasive effects of PBF were evaluated by 2D Boyden chamber , 3D organotypic , and proximity ligation assays . Results : Our study identified that PBF and CTTN physically interact and co - localize , and that this occursatthecellperiphery , particularlyattheleadingedgeofmigratingcancercells . Critically , PBF induces potent cellular invasion and migration in thyroid and breast cancer cells , which is entirely abrogated in the absence of CTTN . Importantly , we found that CTTN is over - expressed in differ - entiated thyroid cancer , particularly in patients with regional lymph node metastasis , which sig - nificantly correlates with elevated PBF expression . Mutation of PBF ( Y174A ) or pharmacological intervention modulates the PBF : CTTN interaction and attenuates the invasive properties of cancer cells . Conclusion : Our results demonstrate a unique role for PBF in regulating CTTN function to promote endocrine cell invasion and migration , as well as identify a new targetable interaction to block tumor cell movement .

Of central importance in attaining this goal is to better understand how tumors exhibit uncontrolled and invasive cellular growth , which is modulated through the interaction of malignant cells with the extracellular matrix , the vasculature , and the im - mune system ( 2 , 3 ) . Considerable attention has focused on the regulation of actin assembly at the leading edge of malignant cells , a process integral to the formation of pro - trusive structures such as invadopodia ( 4 ) . It is known , for instance , that a multitude of diverse signaling molecules such as RhoA can control actin cytoskeletal dynamics in migrating cells ( 5 ) . However , factors that influence actin polymerization in the tumor environment are still poorly understood . Cortactin ( CTTN ) is a scaffold protein active predom - inantly at the periphery of cells which promotes actin po - lymerization by binding and activating the Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( 6 ) , as well as inhibiting debranching of actin networks ( 7 ) . In this way , CTTN is able to exert a potent influence upon cell movement and invasion ( 8 – 10 ) . In - deed , overexpression of CTTN is associated with in - creased cellular motility and invasiveness in multiple can - cer settings ( 8 , 9 ) . CTTN function is multifaceted and has been linked to numerous processes , including vesicular trafficking ( 8 , 11 ) , focal adhesion dynamics ( 12 ) and ex - tracellular matrix secretion ( 13 ) . These studies emphasize the importance of CTTN as a key player in aggressive cancersbutfurtherworkisrequiredtoestablishtheprecise role of CTTN in different tumor settings . Modulators of the complex processes by which cells invade , migrate , and metastasize continue to be identified ( 14 ) . We initially characterized a potential role for the proto - oncogene PTTG1 - binding factor ( PBF / PTTG1IP ) in breast cancer cell invasion in vitro ( 15 ) . Subsequently , three different studies have circumstantially linked PBF to the process of tumor invasion and metastasis in vivo . First , high PBF expression was correlated with distant metasta - sis at diagnosis , tumor node metastasis ( TNM ) stage and disease - specific survival in a large series of papillary thy - roid cancers ( 16 ) . Secondly , high PBF promoter activity wasassociatedwithpoorerclinicaloutcomeandincreased metastatic risk in breast cancer ( 17 ) . Thirdly , colorectal tumors with higher PBF protein expression demonstrated greater vascular invasion ( 18 ) . Thus , it is possible that PBF is integral to tumor cell invasion in vivo . PBF was first identified as a type 1A integral membrane protein ( IMP ) ( 19 ) . IMPs with cytosolic domains can act as anchors for cytoskeletal proteins or be involved with intracellular signaling . Its best described role however lies in binding the sodium iodide symporter NIS and regulat - ing its subcellular localization within thyroid cells ( 20 , 21 ) . PBF also interacts with the tumor suppressor p53 ( 18 , 22 ) and the protein kinase Src ( 23 ) . In particular , PBF is a phospho - protein and interaction with Src elicits phos - phorylation at tyrosine ( Y ) residue 174 . This residue has a potential functional duality as it forms the first residue of a consensus YXX (cid:2) internalization motif . However , althoughpY174isenrichedattheplasmamembrane ( PM ) ( 23 ) , the precise relationship between PBF phosphoryla - tion and intracellular trafficking of its binding partners requires further investigation . Given the emerging roles of PBF in cancer , particularly as a proto - oncogene , here we studied its role in migration and metastasis . We conducted mass spectrometry in thy - roid cancer cells to map the full range of interactions with PBF and identified CTTN as our top hit . As CTTN has a well described role in cell migration and tumor metastasis , we assessed whether the interaction between CTTN and PBF was functional . Extensive data are presented validat - ing and delineating the interaction between the two pro - teins . Thus we identify a new functional binding partner of CTTN , and propose a novel mechanism whereby PBF binds CTTN close to the PM to facilitate cellular move - ment . Modulation of PBF activity may therefore represent a promising new target for addressing tumor cell invasion and migration . Materials and Methods Human tissue and cell culture Human thyroid samples were obtained with local ethics com - mittee approval and informed patient consent .

Results PBF induces cellular invasion and binds CTTN The precise role of PBF in tumor cell invasion remains poorly understood in breast , thyroid , and colorectal can - cer cells ( 15 – 18 ) . We therefore sought to investigate the ability of PBF to induce invasion across a panel of cancer cells ( SupplementalTable1 ) . Thepotentproinvasiveeffect of PBF overexpression was evident in 2D assays in MCF - 7 , TPC - 1 , and HCT116 cell lines ( Figure 1A and Supple - mental Figure 1A ; P (cid:8) . 05 ) . We further performed 3D organotypic invasion assays in MDA - MB - 231 breast cells and showed that PBF is proinvasive in vitro with signifi - cantly increased invasion parameters ( Figure 1B and Sup - plemental Figure 1B ; P (cid:8) . 01 ) . Cell invasion is related to and encompasses cell migration . We therefore next eval - uated cell migration to determine whether elevated levels ofPBFarepromigratory . AstablemurineNIH3T3cellline overexpressing PBF ( (cid:9) 24 - fold increase in PBF mRNA ) demonstrated that PBF induced significant wound healing compared with controls at both 4 and 6 hours postrecov - ery ( Figure 1C ) . Having established that PBF exhibits a broad and con - sistent role in promoting cell invasion , we next performed mass spectrometry in thyroidal TPC - 1 and K1 cell lines to identify possible binding partners of PBF with roles in cell motility . From our in vitro studies we identified CTTN , which was the top hit across all runs ( 12 peptide hits ; average score per peptide (cid:3) 40 . 0 ; n (cid:3) 4 runs ; Supplemen - tal Table 2 ) . Given CTTN’s pivotal role in cell migration and invasion , we appraised the mass spectrometry data doi : 10 . 1210 / jc . 2016 - 1932 press . endocrine . org / journal / jcem 4553 Figure 1 .

These confirmed a specific interaction be - tween PBF and CTTN in vitro ( Figure 1D ) . We challenged our findings with the separate methodology of proximity ligation assays ( PLAs ) ; further demonstrating specific binding between CTTN and PBF predominantly toward the periphery of cells ( Figure 1E ) . No specific interactions wereapparentincontrolPLAassays ( SupplementalFigure 1C ) . CTTN and PBF colocalize during cell migration In basal conditions inactive CTTN diffuses throughout the cytoplasm . However , in migrating cells CTTN local - izes to the cell cortex to mediate actin filament assembly and promote protrusion formation at the leading edge ( 10 ) . We next examined CTTN and PBF by immunoflu - orescence in thyroid SW1736 cells , which revealed CTTN expression predominantly within intracellular vesicles and at the PM ( Figure 2A and Supplemental Figure 2 ) . PBF expression was mainly vesicular , and partially overlapped with CTTN , although not consistently within the same vesicular structures . However , colocalization was pro - nounced at discrete PM regions where CTTN expression was concentrated ( Figure 2A and Supplemental Figure 2 ) . Confocal image analysis confirmed significant overlap at intense ‘hot spots’ of PBF : CTTN colocalization at the PM ( Figure 2A and Supplemental Figure 2B ; see Pearson’s co - efficient ) . Together these results demonstrate that CTTN colocalizes with PBF predominately at the PM . To further investigate the ability of PBF to promote cell migration we performed live cell migration assays in TPC - 1 cells transfected with GFP - tagged PBF . Our results demonstrated an overall induction in cellular migration of approximately 40 % in the presence of PBF ( Figure 2 , B – D ; P (cid:8) . 01 ) . We next determined the colocalization of CTTN and PBF during the process of cellular migration in scratch - wound assays . Our results showed that both pro - teins had significant colocalization at the leading edge of actively migrating MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Figure 2E and Supplemental Figure 3A ) . Again , to determine whether such colocalization was indicative of specific binding , we carried out PLA assays , which revealed that as TPC - 1 and MDA - MB - 231 cells migrate they are characterized by CTTN and PBF binding , particularly at the leading edge ( Figure 2F and Supplemental Figure 3B ) . Thus , CTTN binds PBF in vitro , a process that occurs in those cells actively undergoing migration . CTTN is elevated in differentiated thyroid cancer and correlates with PBF Although CTTN expression has previously been inves - tigated in breast cancer ( 24 ) , it has not been addressed in differentiated thyroidcancer ( DTC ) . Inaseriesofmatched tumor and normal DTC specimens , CTTN mRNA showed a significant 1 . 5 - fold induction in tumors com - pared with matched normal thyroid ( Figure 3A ; P (cid:8) . 05 ; n (cid:3) 43 ) . CTTN expression was also increased in addi - tional DTC specimens ( Figure 3B ) , with a significant in - duction in CTTN protein evident in thyroid tumors ( Fig - ure3C ; (cid:9) 2 . 5 - foldinduction ) . CTTNwasalsoabundantin DTC as determined through immunohistochemistry ( Fig - ure 3D ) , seeming to be generally cytoplasmic within thy - roid epithelial cells . We next determined the association between CTTN and PBF mRNA in DTC and showed a positive and sig - nificant correlation ( Figure 3E ; P (cid:3) . 014 ; r s (cid:3) 0 . 373 ; n (cid:3) 43 ) . The origin of this correlation in expression between CTTN and PBF was obscure as transfection of PBF failed to modulate protein levels of CTTN , and vice versa ( Sup - plemental Figure 4 ) . We therefore further evaluated CTTN and PBF expression in papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC ) by RNA - seq ( TCGA ) . Consistent with our initial observations , we found a significant increase in CTTN expression ( Figure 3F ) in both nonmetastatic ( N0 ; P (cid:3) 5 . 6 (cid:10) 10 (cid:5) 17 ; n (cid:3) 121 ) and metastatic PTC ( N1 ; P (cid:3) 7 . 5 (cid:10) 10 (cid:5) 27 ; n (cid:3) 205 ) compared with normal thyroid ( n (cid:3) 59 ) , as well as in different - sized tumors ( Figure 3F ) , which was associated with subgroups of driver mutations ( Sup - plemental Figure 5A ) . Similarly , PBF expression ( Figure 3G ) was induced in nonmetastatic ( N0 ; P (cid:3) 1 . 0 (cid:10) 10 (cid:5) 7 ; n (cid:3) 121 ) and metastatic PTC ( N1 ; P (cid:3) 8 . 5 (cid:10) 10 (cid:5) 13 ; n (cid:3) 205 ) . Importantly , we again found a strong correlation between CTTN and PBF expression in PTC ( Figure 3H ; P (cid:3) 4 . 7 (cid:10) 10 (cid:5) 8 ; r s (cid:3) 0 . 299 ; n (cid:3) 326 ) and normal thyroid ( Supplemental Figure 5B ) . CTTN and PBF expression in matched tumor / normal samples ( n (cid:3) 59 ) confirmed a strong correlation pattern ( Supplemental Figure 5C ; P (cid:3) 2 . 74 (cid:10) 10 (cid:5) 6 ; r s (cid:3) 0 . 564 ) . Of particular significance , CTTN expression ( Figure 3F ) was higher in invasive metastatic PTC ( N1 ; P (cid:3) 3 . 6 (cid:10) 10 (cid:5) 5 ) than in nonmetastatic PTC ( N0 ) . TCGA clin - ical data also showed that higher CTTN expression was associated with stage IVA PTC ( Figure 3I ; P (cid:8) . 01 ) , re - currence / progressed disease ( Supplemental Figure 6 ; P (cid:8) . 029 ) and frequency of the BRAF mutation ( Supplemental Figure 7 ; P (cid:8) . 001 ) . Together our results demonstrate that CTTN is overexpressed in thyroid cancer , particularly in the most aggressive forms , and significantly correlates with PBF expression . CTTN mediates the influence of PBF on cell invasion There have been inconsistent reports on the role of CTTN in cell motility , with a lack of involvement in the doi : 10 . 1210 / jc . 2016 - 1932 press . endocrine . org / journal / jcem 4555 migration of CTTN - depleted mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( 25 ) , as well as in 293T cells overexpressing CTTN ( 26 ) . Given the interaction between CTTN and PBF , as well as significant correlations in thyroid cancer , we next depleted CTTN to determine the dependence of PBF on CTTN to promote cellular invasion . Critically , knockdown of CTTN by two different CTTN siRNAs ( Figure 4 , A and B ) was associated with a significant reduction in the endoge - nous invasive capacity of SW1736 ( P (cid:8) . 01 ) , HCT116 ( P (cid:8) . 001 ) , and MCF - 7 cells ( P (cid:8) . 01 ) transfected with PBF . Of importance , the inva - sive capacity of CTTN - depleted cells transfected with PBF was equivalent ( P (cid:3) NS ) or lower ( P (cid:8) . 05 ) than vector - only ( VO ) control cells simi - larly depleted of CTTN ( Figure 4B ) . Western blotting confirmed the re - duction of endogenous CTTN pro - tein by CTTN siRNA in all three cell lines , as well as exogenous PBF ex - pression ( Figure 4C ) . Together these results provide compelling evidence that the potent induction of cell in - vasion by PBF is driven in its entirety via CTTN . Phosphorylation modulates the functional interaction of PBF with CTTN Phosphorylation at residue Y174 ( Figure 5A ; pY174 ) is critical to the interaction of PBF with thyroid - en - riched NIS at the PM and its subse - quent intracellular transport ( 23 ) . We therefore investigated whether the phosphorylation status of PBF might influence its interaction with CTTN . To explore this we charac - terized endogenous CTTN and pY174 PBF , which demonstrated co - localization in MCF - 7 and HeLa cells predominantly at the PM ( Fig - ure 5B ) , with significant overlap in - dicated by confocal microscopy ( Fig - ure 5C and Supplemental Figure 8 ; see Pearson’s coefficient ) .

Interestingly , co - IP studies re - vealed that alanine substitution at residue Y174 was as - sociated with markedly increased CTTN - binding ( Figure 5G ; (cid:9) 2 - fold ; P (cid:8) . 05 ) . PLA assays in TPC - 1 and MD - MBA - 231 cells further suggested a strong interaction be - tween Y174A PBF - HA and myc - CTTN ( Figure 5H ) . We next investigated whether the invasive properties of cells might be attenuated by modulating the phosphory - lation status of PBF . Firstly , 2D Boyden chamber assays revealed that Y174A PBF was unable to stimulate cellular invasion in TPC - 1 and MCF - 7 cells ( Figure 6A and Sup - plemental Figure 10 ; P (cid:3) NS ) . These data were appraised in 3D organotypic assays in MDA - MB - 231 cells , which confirmed the lack of cell invasion with Y174A PBF ( Fig - ure 6B ) . Both PBF and CTTN are phosphorylated by Src at residues Y174 and Y421 , respectively ( 9 , 23 ) . Treat - ment with the Src kinase inhibitor dasatinib reduced CTTN phosphorylation by 30 – 50 % and inhibited PBF : CTTN binding by approximately 50 % ( Figure 6C ; P (cid:8) . 001 ) . Y174A PBF again bound CTTN with higher avidity than WT PBF . Critically , dasatinib also significantly re - pressed binding between Y174A PBF and CTTN ( Figure 6C ; P (cid:8) . 001 ) . In scratch wound assays , stable overex - pression of Y174A PBF in MCF - 7 cells was associated with significantly decreased wound healing compared with PBF ( Figure 6D ; P (cid:8) . 05 ) . Importantly , dasatinib treatment inhibited wound healing of MCF - 7 cells over - expressing WT PBF and Y174A PBF ( Figure 6D and Sup - plemental Figure 11 ; P (cid:8) . 05 ) . Subsequent studies dem - onstrated that the invasive properties of dasatinib - treated TPC - 1 cells correlated with PBF phosphorylation status ( Supplemental Figure 12 ) . Altogether these results demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation is critical to the functional interaction of PBF with CTTN in promoting tumor cell invasion . As CTTN and PBF colocalize at the leading edge of migrating cells , our data provides new mechanistic insights into blocking the movement of cancer cells by therapeutic tar - geting of this interaction . A schematic representation of our findings is presented in Figure 6E . Discussion Differentiated thyroid cancer has a 5 - year survival rate of 98 . 1 % , but this decreases dramatically to 55 . 3 % in patients with distant metastases ( http : / / seer . cancer . gov / statfacts / html / thyro . html ) . The statistics are equally un - promising in metastatic breast cancer , where patients have a 5 - year survival rate of just 26 . 3 % . In general , given that it is the metastatic recurrence—and not the primary tu - mor—that ultimately proves fatal , the metastatic pathway requires continued investigation to establish new thera - peutic targets . Through extensive mass spectrometry we identified the proto - oncogene PBF as a new binding part - ner of CTTN—a critical regulator of actin - cytoskeletal dynamics and associated with tumor aggressiveness . A clear interaction between PBF and CTTN at the cell pe - riphery was evident by PLA analysis , which was further validated by co - IP and immunofluorescence assays . Im - portantly , functional CTTN expression was needed in or - der for PBF to induce invasion . Our current study there - fore demonstrates that the proinvasive and promigratory action of PBF is contingent upon CTTN . Expression of PBF has been circumstantially associated with metastasis in patients with breast ( 17 ) and thyroid cancer ( 16 ) , and we recently reported that patients with colorectal cancer who demonstrate extramural vascular invasion have significantly higher PBF expression ( 18 ) . However , these associations have not been appraised for causality , and the in vitro mechanisms by which PBF in - duces tumor cell invasion are unclear . In the present study we therefore utilized established thyroid , breast and colo - rectal models to address the mechanism by which PBF induces cell movement . A remarkable finding was that PBF consistently induced promigratory and proinvasive phenotypes across a panel of different cell types . Our re - sults therefore imply that PBF may represent a novel marker of the ability of cells to escape tumors and invade , which provides further insight for the recent identification of PBF as a central driver gene in human cancers across multiple tumor types including thyroid ( 27 ) . CTTN expression has not been determined before in human thyroid tumors . In this study analysis of DTC spec - imens revealed that CTTN expression , whereas variable , was elevated in approximately two thirds of tumors . Im - portantly , analysis of a large clinically annotated TCGA dataset for PTC confirmed that CTTN was increased , es - pecially in cases with lymph node metastasis . A significant positive association between PBF and CTTN mRNA was also evident in DTC specimens , as well as in TCGA , sug - gesting perhaps a commonality of gene regulation . This would not likely result from direct transcriptional regu - lation via either binding partner as neither CTTN nor PBF Figure 5 . ( Continued ) . PBF in MCF - 7 and HeLa cells .

Previously , am - plification of the gene that encodes CTTN has been re - ported in approximately 15 % of primary metastatic breast carcinomas and approximately 30 % of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ( 28 ) . Thus , the apparent induction of CTTN in DTC may be via gene amplification , or other gene regulatory mechanisms . Notwithstanding this , CTTN overexpression has been extensively linked to invasive cancers , including melanoma , colorectal cancer , and glioblastoma ( 8 , 29 , 30 ) . Future studies will need to determine whether intratumoral heterogeneity stemming from genetic and nongenetic variability influences the ex - pression and colocalization of CTTN and PBF . Arguably the central challenge in human tumor therapy is to identify robust mechanisms of inhibiting cellular in - vasion and metastasis . To this end we appraised PBF as a gene which might represent a therapeutic paradigm in the attenuation of CTTN function . PBF shows the structural hallmarks of being an (cid:4) - helical integral membrane protein ( 19 ) , which continually shuttles to and from the PM ( 21 ) . When we ’locked’ PBF at the PM by disrupting its inter - nalisation motif , we blocked the invasive capacity of cells in vitro , which was accompanied by significantly in - creased PBF : CTTN binding . CTTN regulates membrane trafficking as well as adhesion dynamics ( 8 , 13 ) , and PBF is intimately involved in both processes ( 21 , 23 , 31 ) . Stud - ies will need to address the potential cooperativity of PBF and CTTN in membrane trafficking and cytoplasmic lo - calization , and whether the kinase pathways known to modulate aspects of PBF and CTTN function overlap in vitro and in vivo . The principle sites of tyrosine phosphorylation of CTTN are Y421 and Y466 , within the proline - rich do - main ( 9 ) . Src kinase phosphorylation at Y421 and Y466 is associated with lamaellipodial protrusions and recruit - ment of SH2 domain proteins such as Arg and NCK1 , which links CTTN with N - WASP and WIP , and leads to enhanced activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 32 , 33 ) . Of note , tyrosine phosphorylation of CTTN is also required for the endocytosis of several receptors ( 34 ) . This is par - alleled by one of the central functions of PBF , which is the regulation of the internalisation of PM proteins such as NIS ( 23 , 31 ) , and which is governed by tyrosine phos - phorylation . We therefore attempted to define the effect of altered PBF phosphorylation on CTTN function via mutagenesis and dasatinib treatment . Key among da - satinib’s established targets is Src , which phosphory - lates both CTTN ( 9 ) and PBF ( 23 ) . However , given that dasatinib has a range of targets and functions ( 35 ) , dis - entangling the chronology and relative contribution of Src inhibition to altered CTTN and PBF function is challenging . Wethereforeusedaphospho - nullPBFmutant ( Y174A ) in our dasatinib experiments to discriminate CTTN phos - phorylation events from PBF phosphorylation . These data demonstrated that inhibiting Src reduced phosphoryla - tion of CTTN at Y421 and decreased binding to PBF . Previous studies showed that Src phosphorylation of CTTN can increase its binding affinity to other binding partners such as Dynamin 2 by more than 3 - fold ( 34 ) . Thesefindingsarethereforesupportivethattyrosinephos - phorylation of CTTN promotes binding to PBF . Experi - ments to further define the role of Src phosphorylation at multiple sites in CTTN will be needed using phosphosite mutations at positions Y421 and Y466 . From the PBF side , colocalization of pY174 PBF and CTTN was dem - onstrated at the PM , along with specific binding by co - IP analysis . Therefore , together with the lack of cellular in - vasion observed with Y174A PBF , these results suggest that phosphorylation of PBF at Y174 is required for a functional interaction with CTTN at the PM to mediate cell invasion . Interestingly , Y174A PBF bound CTTN with a higher affinity than WT PBF . Our study inferred a role for PBF as a molecular scaffold or bridging molecule to promote the recruitment of CTTN with other CTTN - binding partners such as Src or the Arp2 / 3 complex and facilitate actin filament assembly . Y174A PBF might have therefore an - tagonized CTTN activity by blocking critical interactions with one or more recognized CTTN - binding partners due to its greater affinity for CTTN and increased retention at the PM . It is also likely that the altered properties of Y174APBFwouldhavedelayedthedynamicregulationof the cortical actin cytoskeleton required for cell migration associated with multiple cycles of actin polymerization and depolymerization to generate the propulsive force needed for lamellipodia extension ( 10 ) . In summary , we present evidence that the proto - onco - gene PBF is a novel interacting partner of the F - actin bind - ing protein CTTN . PBF potently and consistently induces cell invasion and migration , which is dependent upon the presence of CTTN . As PBF and CTTN are induced in multiple tumor types , our study now identifies PBF as an undercharacterized target to block tumor cell movement . Ablating phosphorylation by mutation or treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor modulates the interaction of PBF with CTTN and attenuates cell invasion . Hence , ther - apeutic strategies to manipulate the PBF : CTTN interac - tion need to be further appraised as promising new ave - nues in the treatment of endocrine tumor metastasis .
