MOOLENAAR * Division of Cellular Biochemistry , The Netherlands Cancer Institute , Plesmanlaan 121 , 1066 CX Amsterdam , The Netherlands Lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) is a water - soluble phospholipid with hormone - like and growth - factor - like activities . LPA activates a putative G - protein - coupled receptor in responsive cells , but the natural source of exogenous LPA is unknown . Here we show that LPA is present in mammalian serum in an active form ( bound to albumin ) at concentrations of 1 - 5 , uM , but is not detectable in platelet - poor plasma , suggesting that LPA is INTRODUCTION Apart from playing a key role in the early steps of glycerolipid biosynthesis [ 1 ] , lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ; l - acyl - sn - glycerol 3 - phosphate ) evokes a great variety of biological effects when added to responsive cells [ 2 ] . For example , exogenous LPA causes platelet aggregation [ 3 , 4 ] , smooth - muscle contraction [ 5 , 6 ] , neuronal cell rounding and neurite retraction [ 7 ] and , in fibroblasts , cell proliferation [ 8 , 9 ] . Current evidence strongly suggests that LPA evokes its multiple effects through activation of a specific G - protein - coupled receptor , with consequent stimu - lation of phospholipases C and D and inhibition of adenylate cyclase [ 8 , 10 - 12 ] . A candidate LPA receptor was recently identi - fied by photoaffinity labelling in various LPA - responsive cell types [ 13 ] . However , the natural source of LPA remains unknown to date . LPA is rapidly produced in thrombin - activated platelets [ 14 - 17 ] , apparently in large part through deacylation of newly formed PA [ 17 , 18 ] . A PA - specific phospholipase A2 has been detected in platelets [ 18 ] , but its function has been regarded primarily as a mechanism for the production of arachidonate and its bioactive metabolites . Since LPA is fairly water - soluble ( critical micelle concentrations 70 / tM - 1 mM [ 10 , 19 ] ) , it is pos - sible that endogenously produced LPA , in common with arachidonate metabolites , is released from platelets into the extracellular space to act as a local mediator . The present study was undertaken to examine this possibility . We report that LPA is rapidly released from human platelets upon thrombin stimu - lation and is present in serum ( bound to albumin ) at physio - logically active concentrations , but not in platelet - poor plasma . These results assign a physiological role to LPA as a platelet - derived lipid mediator that may participate in natural wound - healing processes . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials Lipid standards were obtained from Serdary Research Labora - produced during blood clotting . We find that thrombin activation of platelets prelabelled with [ 32P ] Pi results in the rapid release of newly formed [ 32P ] LPA into the extracellular environment . We conclude that LPA is a novel platelet - derived lipid mediator that may play a role in inflammatory and proliferative responses to injury . tories ( London , Ont . , Canada ) . Human a - thrombin , bradykinin , BSA ( Fraction V , fatty - acid - free ) and prostaglandin E1 were from Sigma ; silica gel 60 plates were from Merck ; Indo - I acetoxymethyl ester was from Molecular Probes ( Eugene , OR , U . S . A . ) . Fetal - calf serum ( FCS ; various batches ) was from GIBCO . Carrier - free [ 32P ] Pi was obtained from Amersham . 1 - Oleoyl - [ 32P ] LPA was synthesized as described [ 13 ] . Platelet preparation Human blood from healthy volunteers was anticoagulated with acid / citrate / dextrose as described [ 20 , 21 ] . Platelet - rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation ( 120 g for 15 min ) and im - mediately mixed with prostaglandin E1 ( 100 nM ) to suppress platelet activation . Platelets were collected by centrifugation ( 1200 g for 10 min ) ; after two additional centrifugation steps ( 8000 g for 5 min ) the supernatant was considered ' platelet - poor ' plasma . The platelet pellet was washed three times in a buffer containing 36 mM citric acid , 103 mM NaCl , 4 mM KCI , 5 mM EDTA , 5 . 6 mM glucose , 0 . 35 % ( w / v ) BSA and 100 nM prostaglandin E1 ( pH 6 . 5 ) . Platelet counts were determined in a Coulter counter . Platelet activation and lipid extraction Before activation , platelets ( 2 x 109 cells / ml ) were labelled for 4 h in phosphate - free Eagle ' s Minimum Essential Medium ( Flow Laboratories ) containing 1 mCi / ml [ 32P ] P1 , in the absence or the presence of 10 mM EDTA . Platelets were activated by stirring with 1 unit / ml human a - thrombin in either the absence or the presence of 10 mM EDTA . After stimulation , cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 2 min at 3000 g and resuspended in water . Supernatants were further cleared from cell debris by centri - fugation at 8000 g for 5 min . Lipids from cells and supernatants were extracted separately with butan - - ol ( see below ) . For serum lipid extraction , FCS ( four different batches ; freshly thawed ) and human serum ( from two volunteers ) was diluted 10 - fold in water . All solutions were made 0 . 02 M in acetic acid and extracted with 0 . 5 vol . of butan - l - ol as described [ 22 , 23 ] .

I . c . Lipids were extracted from FCS ( a ) or from human platelet - poor plasma ( b ) , separated by two - dimensional t . l . c . and revealed by iodine staining as described in the Materials and methods section . Lipids were identified by co - migration with authentic standards as indicated in ( c ) . Abbreviations : NL , neutral lipids ; LPC , lyso - PC ; e , origin . When extracted from the t . l . c . plate , only the spot co - migrating with authentic LPA showed biological activity ( see the text ) . the two - phase system was frozen after thorough mixing and thawed again to obtain better separation of the two liquid phases and the protein interphase . After centrifugation , the butan - l - ol phase was removed and the water phase was extracted once again . Butanol fractions were collected and washed twice with 1 vol . of butan - 1 - ol - saturated water . The butan - 1 - ol phase was dried under nitrogen and analysed on a two - dimensional t . l . c . system as described below . Recovery of added tracer [ 32P ] LPA was 98 % . Phospholipid analysis Phospholipids were separated by two - dimensional t . l . c . [ 24 ] on silica gel 60 plates and the solvent systems chloroform / methanol / 7 M ammonia ( 12 : 12 : 1 , by vol . ; two successive runs ) and subsequently chloroform / methanol / acetic acid / water ( 25 : 15 : 4 : 2 , by vol . ) . Serum - and platelet - derived lipids were detected by iodine staining and autoradiography , respectively , and identified by co - migration with non - radioactive marker lipids . Radioactive phospholipids were scraped off the plate and prepared for liquid - scintillation counting . The counts were normalized with respect to the total amount of 32P - labelled phospholipids . We note that , under the labelling conditions used , the total radioactivity of [ 32P ] phosphatidic acid ( [ 32P ] PA ) represents an adequate direct measure for its mass ( e . g . [ 25 ] ) . It seems plausible to assume that the same holds for [ 32P ] LPA , although direct proof for that notion awaits further study . In platelets , not all phospholipids are labelled equally well with 32P . Whereas ( L ) PA and phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) are rapidly and efficiently labelled to isotopic equilibrium [ 25 ] and thus are readily detectable , the major phospholipids phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) , phosphatidyl - ethanolamine ( PE ) and sphingomyelin ( SM ) are poorly labelled , if at all . Poor 32P - labelling of PC , PE and SM in platelets is probably due to the relatively low rates of synthesis de novo of their precursors [ 26 , 27 ] . Serum phospholipids were scraped into vials and quantified by the phosphorus - content assay as described [ 28 , 29 ] . For acyl - chain analysis of serum phospholipids , fatty acid methyl esters were generated by heating the silica gels with 4 % HCI in methanol at 80 Â°C for 4 h . The methyl esters were analysed in a gas chromatograph ( Carlo Erba Strumentazione , model HRGC 5300 ) equipped with a flame ionization detector . The stationary phase was 10 % CP - Sil 58 in a glass column ( 2500 cm x 0 . 32 cm ) . Measurement of cytoplasmic free Ca2 + Confluent human A431 cells , grown on glass coverslips , were loaded with the fluorescent Ca2 + indicator Indo - I and Ca2 + - dependent fluorescence was monitored as described [ 10 ] . A431 cells were used because they are highly responsive to exogenous LPA with regard to Ca2 + mobilization ( [ 10 ] , and results not shown ) . Gel - filtration chromatography BSA / [ 32P ] LPA mixtures were fractionated on a Sephadex G - 50 gel - filtration column as explained in the Results and discussion section . The column was equilibrated and run in phosphate - buffered saline ( 150 mM NaCl , 3 . 3 mM KCI , 1 . 8 mM KH2PO4 , 10 mM Na2HP04 ; pH 7 . 2 ) . Fractions ( 0 . 5 ml ) were collected and processed for protein determinations and / or liquid - scintillation counting . Relative protein concentration was measured by u . v . absorbance at 280 nm . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION LPA as a bloactive serum constituent If LPA is released from activated platelets , it may be detectable in whole serum . We extracted FCS with butanol and analysed the lipid fraction by a two - dimensional t . l . c . system [ 24 ] that allows LPA to be separated from other polar lipids with a high degree of resolution . Figure l ( a ) shows the result of a typical experiment in which LPA is clearly detected and identified as a normal serum constituent , based on its co - migration with auth - entic standards ( Figure 1c ) . Four other experiments , using different batches of FCS , gave similar results . Using the same extraction protocol , we also detected LPA in freshly isolated human serum ( results not shown ) , but not in human platelet - poor plasma ( Figure lb ) . Quantitative phosphorus analysis of the scraped LPA spots yielded an average serum LPA con - centration of approx . 2 , uM ( range 1 - 5 1uM ; four determinations yielding values of 1 . 1 , 1 . 2 , 2 . 0 and 4 . 8 , uM ) .

Note desensitization of the response to synthetic LPA , but not bradykinin , by prior addition of serum - derived LPA . F denotes Ca2 + - dependent indo - 1 fluorescence . are palmitoyl - , stearoyl - , oleoyl - and arachidonoyl - LPA ( T . Hengeveld and K . Jalink , unpublished work ) ; these fatty acid species are very similar to those produced in activated platelets [ 17 ] . Figure 2 shows that when serum LPA is extracted from the t . l . c . plate and applied to Indo - 1 - loaded A431 cells , an immediate Ca2 + transient ensues which is indistinguishable from that evoked by synthetic long - chain LPA [ 10 ] or whole serum [ 30 ] . Prior addition of serum - derived LPA completely desensitizes the response to subsequent addition of synthetic 1 - oleoyl - LPA , but leaves the response to the peptide bradykinin unaltered ( Figure 2 ) . It thus appears that serum - borne LPA , like synthetic LPAs , can serve as a potent Ca2 + - mobilizing agonist . van der Bend et al . [ 13 ] recently showed that photoreactive LPA can bind to three distinct serum proteins , namely BSA ( 68 kDa ) and , to a lesser extent , 28 kDa and 15 kDa proteins . We applied a mixture of BSA and I - oleoyl - LPA containing tracer amounts of [ 32P ] LPA to a gel - filtration column and found that LPA co - elutes with BSA ( Figure 3 ) . Furthermore , when 1 - oleoyl - LPA was mixed with BSA ( molar ratio 2 : 1 ) , its biological activity ( as determined by Ca2 + mobilization and neurite re - traction ) was not detectably reduced ; extensive dialysis ( 30 kDa cut - off ) of the LPA / BSA mixture against water did not result in loss of activity , whereas dialysis of a BSA - free LPA solution completely removed activity ( results not shown ) . Taken together , these results indicate that LPA binds tightly to albumin and that albumin - bound LPA is biologically active . Support for this notion comes from a recent study by Ridley and Hall [ 31 ] , who inferred that the stress - fibre - inducing activity of serum , as observed in fibroblasts , is likely to be due to albumin - bound LPA . Release of LPA from activated platelets We next examined whether LPA is released from platelets when they are activated under physiological conditions . Freshly iso - lated human platelets were prelabelled with [ 32P ] Pi and then stimulated with human thrombin for 10 min . followed by lipid extraction of cells and medium . As demonstrated in Figure 4 and Figure 3 Co - fractionation of [ 32P ] LPA with serum albumin BSA ( - ) , 1 - oleoyl - [ 32P ] LPA ( - ) , or BSA preincubated for 20 min with equimolar amounts of 1 - oleoyl - LPA and trace amounts of [ 32P ] LPA ( 0 ) was applied to a Sephadex G - 50 column and eluted with phosphate - buffered saline ( see the Materials and methods section ) . Fractions ( 0 . 5 ml ) were collected and assayed for [ 32P ] LPA content ( c . p . m . ) and / or BSA concentration ( u . v . absorbance at 280 nm ) .

Lipids were extracted from both the cell pellet and medium , and analysed by two - dimensional t . l . c . Labelled spots were identified by co - migration with unlabelled markers . The autoradiogram shows phospholipids present in the cells and medium , as indicated . Abbreviation : 0 , origin . The appearance of labelled PA and Pi in the medium is due to contaminating membrane fragments ( see also Table 1 ) . Note the appearance of radiolabelled ADP and ATP in the medium ( these spots may also contain GDP and GTP , respectively ) . Table 1 , thrombin - activated platelets rapidly release a large part of their newly formed LPA into the extracellular environment , whereas newly generated PA ( like PC and PI ) remains associated mainly with the cells . In agreement with previous reports [ 16 , 17 ] , we detected little or no [ 32P ] LPA in resting platelets ( Figure 4 ) . Previous mass determinations indicate a net production of about 5 ng of LPA / 109 platelets ( i . e . approx . 12 pmol / 109 platelets ) upon stimulation with thrombin for 2 min [ 17 ] . Our analysis of LPA in cells and supernatants reveals that as much as 90 % of newly generated LPA is released into the medium ( Table 1 ) . Based on the aforementioned mass determinations , this would amount to roughly 10 pmol of LPA released per 109 cells . In blood clots , however , the local LPA concentrations are expected to attain much higher levels . - LPA formation and release by thrombin - activated platelets is inhibited in the presence of EDTA ( Figure 5 ) ( cf . [ 16 ] ) . In the nominal absence of bivalent cations , platelets are unable to aggregate due to impaired fibrinogen binding to the platelet IF 1 mi t LPA 3 - r E 2 6 .

Figure 4 ) . surface [ 32 ] . Whether aggregation itself is a prerequisite for LPA production , or else the conversion of PA into LPA via phospholipase A2 [ 18 ] depends on Ca2 + influx , remains to be explored . Conclusions The present study advances our understanding of LPA as a bioactive phospholipid in that it demonstrates that LPA is rapidly released from activated platelets and that LPA is an active albumin - bound constituent of serum . In view of LPA ' s mitogenic potential , we propose that platelet - derived LPA participates in the natural wound - healing process by stimulating cell proliferation at sites of injury and inflammation , probably in synergy with other platelet - derived mediators and peptide growth factors . In addition to activating quiescent fibroblasts , LPA acts on platelets themselves , which may introduce an element of signal amplification ( positive feedback ) in the initial aggregation response , perhaps similar to the mechanism by which secreted arachidonate metabolites and ADP amplify platelet responses [ 32 ] . It remains to be determined whether LPA is released via a distinct secretory pathway , or simply diffuses out of the cells during the irreversible phase of aggregation when platelets become leaky . Further experiments are also required to assess whether activated platelets are the only source of serum - borne LPAs . Given the great diversity of LPA - responsive cell types , ranging from amphibian oocytes [ 33 - 35 ] to mammalian neuronal cells [ 7 ] , we expect that LPA formation and release would not be restricted to activated platelets . Support for this view is provided by a recent study which indicates that LPA is rapidly generated in growth - factor - stimulated fibroblasts ( see Table 2 in [ 36 ] ) . The possibility that , under certain conditions , cell types other than platelets also secrete LPA into the extracellular space is now under investigation .
