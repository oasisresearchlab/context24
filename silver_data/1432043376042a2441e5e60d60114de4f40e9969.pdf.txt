When observed by immunoﬂuorescence microscopy , they usually appear as 20 – 50 irregularly shaped structures that vary in size . Speckles are dynamic structures , and theirconstituents can exchange continuously with the nucleoplasm and other nuclear locations , including active transcription sites . Studies on the composition , structure , and dynamics of speckles have provided an important paradigm for understanding the functional organization of the nucleus and the dynamics of the gene expression machinery . T he mammalian cell nucleus is a highly com - partmentalized yet extremely dynamic org - anelle ( reviewed in Misteli 2001a ; Spector 2006 ; Zhao et al . 2009 ) . Many nuclear factors are localized in distinct structures , such as speckles , paraspeckles , nucleoli , Cajal bodies , polycomb bodies , and promyelocytic leukemia bodies and show punctate staining patterns when analyzed by indirect immunoﬂuorescence microscopy ( reviewed in Lamond et al . 1998 ; Spector 2001 ; Spector 2006 ) . In mammalian cells the pre - mRNA splicing machinery , including small nuclear ribonucleo - protein particles ( snRNPs ) , spliceosome sub - units , and other non - snRNP protein splicing factors , shows a punctate nuclear localization pattern that is usually termed “a speckled pat - tern” but has also been referred to as “SC35 do - mains ( Wansink et al . 1993 ) ” or “splicing factor compartments ( Phair et al . 2000 ) ” ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . The ﬁrst detailed description of the nuclear domains that we presently refer to as nuclear speckles was reported by Santiago Ramo´n y Cajal in 1910 ( Ramo´n y Cajal 1910 ; reviewed in Lafarga et al . 2009 ) . Ramo´n y Cajal used acid aniline stains to identify structures he referred to as “grumos hialinas” ( literally “tran - slucent clumps” ) . The term “speckles” was ﬁrst put forth in 1961 by J . Swanson Beck ( Beck 1961 ) upon examination of rat liver sections immunolabeled with the serum of individuals with autoimmune disorders . Although the con - nection was not made at the time , these speckles had been identiﬁed two years earlier by Hewson Swift ( Swift 1959 ) at the electron microscopic level and called interchromatin particles . Swift observed that these particles were not randomly distributed but that they occurred in localized Editors : Tom Misteli and David L .

However , the ﬁrst link between pre - mRNA splicing and nuclear speckles or interchromatin gran - ule clusters came from an examination of the distribution of snRNPs using anti - splicing factor - speciﬁc antibodies , demonstrating a speckled distribution pattern of snRNPs in cell nuclei ( Lerner et al . 1981 ; Perraud et al . 1979 ; Spector et al . 1983 ) . It is now clear that much of the punctate localization of splicing factors observed by im - munoﬂuorescence microscopy corresponds to the presence of these factors in nuclear speckles of variable size and irregular shape that are revealed by electron microscopy as inter - chromatin granule clusters ( IGCs ) ( Fig . 3 ) . IGCs range in size from one to several micrometers in diameter and are composed of 20 – 25 nm granules that are connected in places by a thin ﬁbril resulting in a beaded chain appearance ( Thiry 1995b ) . These structures can be observed by electron microscopy without antibody la - beling ( Thiry 1995b ) . We will deﬁne “speckles” here speciﬁcally as the IGC component of the splicing factor labeling pattern , and distinguish this from other nuclear structures , including perichromatin ﬁbrils and Cajal bodies , which also contain splicing factors ( reviewed in Fakan 1994 ; Spector 1993 ) . For some of the speckle components a speckle targeting signal has been identiﬁed . The arginine / serine - rich domain ( RS domain ) of some SR pre - mRNA splicing factors has been shown to be necessary and sufﬁcient for the tar - geting of these factors to nuclear speckles ( Caceres et al . 1997 ; Hedley et al . 1995 ; Li et al . 1991 ) . In addition , the threonine - proline repeats of SF3b1 ( Eilbracht et al . 2001 ) and the forkhead - associated domain in NIPP1 ( Jagiello et al . 2000 ) have also been implicated in speckle - targeting . Most recently , Salichs et al . ( Salichs et al . 2009 ) performed a genome - wide analysis of homopolymeric histidine tracts and identiﬁed 86 human proteins that contain stretches of ﬁve or more histidines . Of the 22 Figure 1 .

Based on these data , the polyHis - repeats were proposed to act as a speckle - targeting signal that functions by acting as an interaction surface for resident nuclear speckle constituents . Interestingly , these target - ing signals rely mostly on charge effects , being basic protein regions . Interestingly , structures similar to nuclear speckles have been identiﬁed in the amphibian oocyte nucleus ( Gall et al . 1999 ) and in Dro - sophila melanogaster embryos when transcrip - tion increases upon cellularization during cycle 14 ( Segalat et al . 1992 ) , but not in yeast ( Potashkin et al . 1990 ) . Importantly , not all nuclear proteins that show a speckle - like label - ing pattern by immunoﬂuorescencemicroscopy localize to IGCs . Forexample , the ERrepeatpro - tein YT521 - B localizes in a speckled - like distri - bution that corresponds to YT bodies ( Nayler et al . 2000 ) , whereas PSPC1 localizes in approx - imately 5 – 20 punctate interchromatin struc - tures termed “paraspeckles , ” which are also distinct from nuclear speckles ( Fox et al . 2002 ; Fox and Lamond 2010 ) . Therefore , it is essential to perform double - label immunoﬂuorescence studies using an anti - splicing factor antibody to conﬁrm the localization of any novel factors to nuclear speckles . STRUCTURE AND LOCATION OF SPECKLES As determined by both light and electron mi - croscopy , the clusters of interchromatin gran - ules that constitute speckles form throughout the nucleoplasm in regions containing little or no DNA ( Thiry 1995b ) . Although they ap - parently contain few , if any , genes speckles are often observed close to highly active transcrip - tion sites . This suggests that they likely have a functional relationship with gene expression , and some speciﬁc genes have been reported to preferentially localize near speckles ( Brown et al . 2008 ; Huang et al . 1991 ; Johnson et al . 2000 ; Moen et al . 2004 ; Smith et al . 1999 ; Xing et al . 1993 ; Xing et al . 1995 ) , although this does not appear to be obligatory for transcription / pre - mRNA splicing . Interestingly , Shopland et al . ( Shopland et al . 2003 ) found that gene - rich chromosomal regions ( R - bands ) are more frequently found along the edge of nuclear speckles than gene - poor regions ( G - bands ) . In addition , coordinately expressed active genes can be found in association with the same nu - clear speckle . Based on these ﬁndings , Shopland et al . ( 2003 ) suggested that nuclear speckles act as functional centers that organize active genes on their periphery to form euchromatic neighborhoods . Several lines of evidence point to speckles acting as storage / assembly / modiﬁcation com - partments that can supply splicing factors to active transcription sites ( reviewed in Lamond and Spector 2003 ) . For example , a series of high resolution pulse - labeling experiments analyzed at the electron microscopic level , studying the incorporation of either tritiated uridine or Br - UTP after short pulses , have shown that nascent pre - mRNA is predomi - nantly localized outside of nuclear speckles ( IGCs ) in ﬁbrillar structures , 3 – 5 nm in diam - eter , which are termed perichromatin ﬁbrils ( PFs ) ( Cmarko et al . 1999 ; Fakan et al . 1971 ; Fakan et al . 1978 ; Monneron et al . 1969 ) . It is likely that most of the cotranscriptional splicing Figure 3 . Nuclear speckles are equivalent to inter - chromatin granule clusters .

Nuclear Speckles Cite this article as Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol 2011 ; 3 : a000646 3 is associated with these PFs , rather than within IGCs . PFs can occur both on the periphery of IGCs and in nucleoplasmic regions away from IGCs ( Fakan 1994 ) . Some apparent discrepancies in the litera - ture concerning the possible direct role of spe - ckles as splicing sites may have arisen because the PFs can show a close topological relation - ship with the periphery of IGCs . Using the ﬂuo - rescence microscope it is difﬁcult to distinguish these PFs from the IGCs . In addition , as highly expressed genes will recruit a signiﬁcant amount of pre - mRNA splicing factors ( Huang et al . 1996 ) , these regions of highly active transcrip - tion will be indistinguishable from IGCs at the ﬂuorescence microscopy level . Although many in the ﬁeld do not view speckles as dir - ect transcription / pre - mRNA splicing centers , others suggest that they may have a more direct role relating to the splicing and transport of pre - mRNA ( reviewed in Hall et al . 2006 ; Melcak et al . 2000 ; Shopland et al . 2002 ; Wei et al . 1999 ) . COMPOSITION OF SPECKLES Many pre - mRNA splicing factors , including snRNPs and SR proteins ( Fu 1995 ) , have been localized to nuclear speckles by either immuno - ﬂuorescence , ﬂuorescent protein - tagging , and / or immunoelectron microscopy . In fact , this speckled localization pattern is highly diagnos - tic for proteins involved in pre - mRNA splicing . In addition , several kinases ( Clk / STY , hPRP4 , and PSKHI ) ( Brede et al . 2002 ; Colwill et al . 1996 ; Ko et al . 2001 ; Kojima et al . 2001 ; Sacco - Bubulya et al . 2002 ) and phosphatases ( PP1 ) ( Trinkle - Mulcahy et al . 1999 ; Trinkle - Mulcahy etal . 2001 ) that phosphorylate / dephosphorylate components of the splicing machinery have also been localized to nuclear speckles . This supports the idea that speckles may be involved in regulat - ing the pool of factors that are accessible to the transcription / pre - mRNA processing machinery ( reviewed in Misteli et al . 1997b ) . The protein composition of nuclear speckles has been assessed by proteomic analysis of an enriched IGC fraction puriﬁed from mouse liver nuclei . This approach identiﬁed 146 known proteins , as well as numerous uncharacterized proteins ( Mintz et al . 1999 ; Saitoh et al . 2004 ) . The proteomic information , together with additional localization studies , has revealed that speckles contain many other proteins apart from pre - mRNA splicing factors . Of particu - lar interest is the localization of transcription factors ( Larsson et al . 1995 ; Mortillaro et al . 1996 ; Zeng et al . 1997 ) , 3 0 - end RNA processing factors ( Krause et al . 1994 ; Schul et al . 1998 ) , eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E ( Dostie et al . 2000 ) , eif4AIII , a protein involved in translation inhibition ( Li et al . 1999 ) , and structural proteins ( Jagatheesan et al . 1999 ; Nakayasu et al . 1984 ; Sharma et al . 2010 ) . Consis - tent with these ﬁndings , proteomic analyses of in vitro assembled spliceosomes indicate that they may also contain transcription and 3 0 - end RNA processing factors , together with splicing factors , in a higher order complex ( Rappsilber et al . 2002 ; Zhou et al . 2002 ) . However , they do not contain factors primarily involved in ribosome subunit biogenesis or tRNA produc - tion , and the protein composition of speckles underlines their close relationship with mecha - nisms of gene expression by RNA Pol II . Although transcription does not take place within the majority of nuclear speckles ( Cmarko et al . 1999 ) and DNA is not localized to these nuclear regions ( reviewed in Thiry 1995b ) , a population of the serine - 2 - phosphorylated form of the RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) large subunit ( LS ) that is involved in elongation has been localized to these regions by immuno - ﬂuorescence microscopy ( Bregman et al . 1995 ; Mortillaro et al . 1996 ) . In addition , biochemi - cal characterization of the IGC proteome has identiﬁed several subunits of RNAPII ( Mintz et al . 1999 ; Saitoh et al . 2004 ) , supporting the presence of a pool of RNAPII in speckles . How - ever , other studies have not observed an enrich - ment of RNAPII in speckles ( Grande et al . 1997 ; Kimura et al . 2002 ; Zeng et al . 1997 ) and it is not present in B snurposomes ( Doyle et al . 2002 ) . The Cdk9 - cyclin T1 complex , also known as TAK / P - TEFb , is thought to be involved in transcriptional elongation via phosphorylation of the RNAPII LS ( reviewed in Price 2000 ) . This complex was found diffusely distributed throughout the nucleoplasm , but not in nucleoli D . L . Spector and A . I . Lamond 4 Cite this article as Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol 2011 ; 3 : a000646 ( Herrmann et al . 2001 ) . In addition , a signiﬁ - cant overlap between cyclin T1 and nuclear speckles was observed . However , although Cdk9 was present in the vicinity of nuclear speckles , the degree of overlap was limited ( Herrmann et al . 2001 ; Matera et al . 1993 ) . Further evidence for a link between tran - scription and speckles comes from observations on FBI - 1 , a cellular POZ - domain - containing protein that binds to the HIV - 1 long terminal repeat and associates with the HIV - 1 transac - tivator protein Tat ( Pessler et al . 1997 ) . FBI - 1 has been found to partially colocalize with Tat and its cellular cofactor , P - TEFb at nuclear spe - ckles ( Pendergrast et al . 2002 ) . In addition , the nucleosome binding protein HMG - 17 , which canalter thestructureofchromatinandenhance transcription , has been localized in a similar pattern to FBI - 1 ( Hock et al . 1998 ) . Therefore , although little or no transcription takes place in nuclear speckles , a subset of proteins involved in this process are associated with these nuclear regions in addition tobeing present at transcrip - tion sites . Although it is currently unclear what determines the subset of transcription factors that are localized to nuclear speckles , their pres - ence may relate to the assembly of higher - order complexes and / or to regulatory steps affecting either the modiﬁcation state or accessibility of speciﬁc transcription factors . In addition to transcription factors , a popu - lation of poly ( A ) þ RNA has been localized to nuclear speckles ( Carter et al . 1991 ; Huang et al . 1994 ; Visa et al . 1993 ) . This population of poly ( A ) þ RNA does not chase to the cyto - plasm when transcription is blocked with a - amanitin , as would be expected if these spe - cies represented nascent mRNA ( Huang et al . 1994 ) . Interestingly , Hutchinson et al . ( Hutch - inson et al . 2007 ) identiﬁed MALAT1 ( metasta - sis - associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 ) , a long nuclear retained noncoding RNA to be enriched in nuclear speckles ( reviewed in Wilusz et al . 2009 ) . Recent studies have impli - cated MALAT1 in the recruitment of SR splicing factors from nuclear speckles to sites of tran - scription ( Bernard et al . 2010 ) and in the regula - tion of alternative splicing by modulating SF2 / ASF phosphorylation ( Tripathi et al . 2010 ) . Although an underlying scaffold that would serve as a platform on which to organize IGCs has thus far not been identiﬁed ( Sacco - Bubulya et al . 2002 ) , several proteins with possible struc - tural roles in the nucleus , such as a popula - tion of lamin A ( Jagatheesan et al . 1999 ) and snRNP - associated actin ( Nakayasu et al . 1984 ) , have been detected in nuclear speckles . However , another study failed to detect an alteration in nuclear speckles in LMNA - / - cells ( Vecerova et al . 2004 ) . In addition to actin , phosphatidyl - inositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate [ PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] , a lipid that regulates actin - binding proteins ( Zhao et al . 1998 ) , as well as multiple phospha - tidylinositol phosphate kinase ( PIPK ) isoforms , have also been localized to nuclear speckles ( Bor - onenkov et al . 1998 ) . Recently , Sharma et al . ( Sharma et al . 2010 ) have implicated the 2530 - amino acid Son protein in the organization of nuclear speckles . Son contains a concentrated region of multiple tandem repeat sequences including multiple serine - rich repeats and an RS domain . Based on RNAi depletion experi - ments , Son was proposed to act as a scaffolding protein for RNA processing factors in nuclear speckles ( Sharma et al . 2010 ) . DYNAMICS OF NUCLEAR SPECKLES Speckles are dynamic structures ; their size , shape , and number can vary , both between dif - ferent cell types and within acell type , according to the levels of gene expression and in response to signalsthat inﬂuence the pools of active splic - ing and transcription factors available . When transcription is halted , either by the use of in - hibitors , oras a result of heat shock , splicing fac - tors accumulate predominantly in enlarged , rounded speckles ( Melcak et al . 2000 ; Spector et al . 1991 ; Spector et al . 1983 ) . The fact that nuclear speckles become round and increase in size upon transcriptional inhibition supports the view that speckles may function in the storage / assembly / modiﬁcation of splicing fac - tors , and that they are not direct sites of splic - ing . Furthermore , when expression of intron - containing genes increases ( Huang et al . 1996 ; Misteli et al . 1997a ) , or during viral infection when transcription levels are high ( Bridge et al . Nuclear Speckles Cite this article as Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol 2011 ; 3 : a000646 5 1995 ; Jime´nez - Garcı´a et al . 1993 ) , the accumu - lation of splicing factors in speckles is reduced , and they redistribute to nucleoplasmic tran - scription sites . Individual speckle components can therefore shuttle continually between spe - ckles and active gene loci . Speckles are also dy - namically regulated during mitosis . The movement of factors into and out of speckles can be directly visualized by ﬂuores - cence microscopy as ﬂuctuations in the shape and intensity of speckles in live cells express - ing splicing factor / ﬂuorescent protein fusions ( Misteli et al . 1997a ) . Speckles in such cells show transcription - dependent peripheral move - ments , although individual speckles remain in their neighborhoods . Photobleaching techni - ques have also been used to measure the ﬂux of some speckle components and have shown that their exchange rate is very rapid ( Kruhlak et al . 2000 ; Phair et al . 2000 ) . Complete recovery for GFP - SF2 / ASF ( a member of the SR - family of pre - mRNA splicing factors ) , after photobleach - ing of the ﬂuorescence signal in speckles , was ap - parent in approximately 30 seconds with half recovery in approximately 3 – 5 seconds . The movement rates for splicing factors through the nucleoplasm were measured to be slow com - pared with free GFP ; this reduction in movement was proposed to result from multiple transient interactions of splicing factors with nuclear binding sites , both within and outside of speck - les . Kinetic modeling indicated that the maximal mean residence time for GFP - SF2 / ASF in speck - les was less than 50 seconds ( Phair et al . 2000 ) . It is a remarkable feature of nuclear organization that at steady - state the overall structure of speckles , as well as other nuclear domains , per - sists despite the large ﬂux of their components . THE SPECKLE CELL CYCLE Upon entry into mitosis and following break - down of the nuclear envelope / lamina , proteins associated with nuclear speckles become dif - fusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm ( Ferreira et al . 1994 ; Reuter et al . 1985 ; Spector et al . 1986 ; Thiry 1995a ) . During metaphase , these proteins continue to localize in a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern and also accumulate within one to three small structures called mitotic interchromatin granules ( MIGs ) ( Ferreira et al . 1994 ; Leser et al . 1989 ; Prasanth et al . 2003 ; Verheijen et al . 1986 ) . MIGs appear to be structurally analogous to IGCs ( Leser et al . 1989 ; Thiry 1993 ; Thiry 1995a ) . As mitosis pro - gresses from anaphase to early telophase , the MIGs increase in number and size . During mid - to late - telophase and after re - formation of the nuclear envelope / lamina , pre - mRNA splicing factors enter daughter nuclei and , con - comitantly , their localization in MIGs de - creases , demonstrating that these factors are recycled from the cytoplasmic MIGs into dau - ghter nuclei ( Prasanth et al . 2003 ) . Live - cell studies have indicated that the majority of these factors enter daughter nuclei within 10 minutes ( Prasanth et al . 2003 ) . Although MIGs have been proposed to be the mitotic equivalent of nuclear speckles ( Fer - reira et al . 1994 ; Leser et al . 1989 ; Thiry 1995a ; Thiry 1995b ) , their function in mitotic cells is unclear . In telophase cells , some MIGs were found to be in close proximity to the newly formed nuclear envelope ( Prasanth et al . 2003 ; Thiry 1995a ) . This close proximity of MIGs to the nuclear periphery and the disappearance of MIGs in late telophase cells with the con - comitant appearance of IGCs in daughter nuclei have suggested that the MIGs might be directly transported into the nuclei ( Leser et al . 1989 ; Thiry 1995a ) . However , colocalization of SF2 / ASF and a hyperphosphorylated form of RNA - PII LS in MIGs of late telophase cells has sug - gested that this may not be the case . For example , SF2 / ASF and other pre - mRNA pro - cessing factors were shown to enter daughter nuclei while a subpopulation of SC35 and RNAPII LS remained in MIGs until G1 , demon - strating that various components of MIGs are differentially released for subsequent entry into daughter nuclei ( Prasanth et al . 2003 ) . Further support for differential release of factors from MIGs comes from an earlier study that reported the nuclear import of snRNPs while cytoplasmic MIGs were still labeled with anti - SR protein and anti - SC35 antibodies ( Fer - reira et al . 1994 ) . Based on these ﬁndings , it was suggested that MIGs may play important roles D . L . Spector and A . I . Lamond 6 Cite this article as Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol 2011 ; 3 : a000646 either in the modiﬁcation of the components of the splicing machinery before their nuclear entry , or as enriched populations of these fac - tors , allowing for protein - protein interactions to occur between subsets of proteins before their nuclear entry ( Prasanth et al . 2003 ) . Interestingly , splicing factors were shown to be competent for pre - mRNA splicing immedi - ately upon entry into daughter nuclei ( Prasanth et al . 2003 ) , supporting the possibility that MIGs may be responsible for splicing factor modiﬁcation , allowing for immediate targeting of modiﬁed ( phosphorylated ) pre - mRNA pro - cessing complexes to transcription sites in telo - phase nuclei . Because daughter nuclei late in telophase have not yet assembled nuclear speck - les , cytoplasmic MIGs are likely to function as their counterparts to provide competent pre - mRNA splicing factors to the initial sites of transcription in newly formed nuclei ( Prasanth et al . 2003 ) . Perhaps splicing factors are released from MIGs via hyperphosphorylation , as has been shown for their release from nuclear spe - ckles in interphase nuclei . SPECKLE BIOGENESIS Nuclear speckles are one of the most prominent nuclear compartments , and their study has served as a paradigm for understanding the bio - genesis of nuclear bodies . Most evidence points to the fact that nuclear speckles form through a process of self - assembly ( reviewed in Misteli 2001b ) whereby transient macromolecular in - teractions form the basis of speckle morphogen - esis . Under steady - state conditions , the respective rates of association and disassociation of individ - ual speckle components will deﬁne their ex - change rates and the sizes of their bound and soluble pools in the nucleus . Regulatory mecha - nisms can inﬂuence these association and / or disassociation rates , thereby changing the frac - tion of bound and soluble speckle components in response to speciﬁc cellular signals . In this view , the entryof splicing factors into late - telophase nuclei results in an association of a subset of these factors with initial tran - scription / pre - mRNA processing sites ( Prasanth et al . 2003 ) . As the population of factors increases , there is an increased probability of protein - protein interactions among those fac - tors not engaged in transcription / pre - mRNA processing , resulting in the formation of nu - clear speckles . These initial speckles appear to form predominantly in nucleoplasmic regions that are devoid of chromosome territories and / or other nuclear organelles . They may ini - tiate either at random locations , or in the vicin - ity of genes that are transcribed at high levels during the telophase / G1 transition . Interest - ingly , in this regard Brown et al . ( Brown et al . 2008 ) examined the position of various ery - throid genes in erythroblasts and found that the majority of associations between erythroid genes occurred at a nuclear speckle . Interest - ingly , the associations were predominantly ob - served in regard to active genes . Based on their ﬁndings , the authors proposed that active genes can be brought into close proximity by the nu - cleation of splicing factors into nuclear speckles . The size and shape of interphase speckles is a reﬂection of the steady - state dynamics of pro - tein constituents that are both arriving at and leaving from these structures ( Kruhlak et al . 2000 ; Phair et al . 2000 ) . Although photobleach - ing analyses have indicated rapid recovery kinetics of splicing factors in speckles , consis - tent with a diffusion - based process ( Kruhlak et al . 2000 ; Phair et al . 2000 ) , the relative size of speckles remains constant throughout inter - phase . In fact , the incubation of permeabilized cells with a nuclear extract containing an ATP - regenerating system maintains transcriptional activity and does not result in a loss of speckles ( Misteli et al . 1996 ) , nor does simple treatment of unﬁxed cells with detergent ( Spector et al . 1992 ) . The observed basal exchange rate may be directly related to the maintenance of speckles , rather than indirectly related to an involvement in transcriptional / pre - mRNA processing ev - ents . In addition , the irregular shape of individ - ual nuclear speckles in interphase nuclei may result froma nonuniform releaseand / ordelivery of factors , related to the location of active genes in their vicinity ( Misteli et al . 1997a ) . Con - sistent with this possibility , either upon inhi - bition of RNAPII transcription by a - amanitin Nuclear Speckles Cite this article as Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol 2011 ; 3 : a000646 7 ( Spector et al . 1993 ) , or inhibition of pre - mRNA splicing using an antisense approach ( O’Keefe et al . 1994 ) , speckles tend to round - up , suggest - ing a uniform exchange rate of factors in all directions . This exchange rate of speckle factors may be regulated through phosphorylation / dephos - phorylation events . For example , phosphoryla - tion of the RS domain of SR splicing factors has been shown to be necessary for recruitment of SR proteins from nuclear speckles to sites of transcription / pre - mRNA processing ( Misteli et al . 1998 ) and for their association with the forming spliceosome ( Mermoud et al . 1994 ) . Several kinases ( i . e . , Clk / STY [ Colwill et al . 1996 ; Sacco - Bubulya et al . 2002 ] and hPRP4 [ Kojima et al . 2001 ] ) involved in this phosphor - ylation , as well as a kinase proposed to be in - volved in the phosphorylation of the carboxy - terminal domain of RNAPII LS in vitro ( Ko et al . 2001 ) , have been localized to nuclear speckles , leaving open the possibility that phos - phorylation / dephosphorylation plays a role in determining the basal rate of factor exchange . However , in addition to the basal activities , an additional level of control can be exerted by modulating phosphorylation events . For exam - ple , the rapid induction either of a gene ( Huang et al . 1996 ) , or group of genes such as during viral infection ( Bridge et al . 1995 ; Jime´nez - Garcı´a et al . 1993 ) , can result in an increased outward ﬂow of factors from speckles . An ex - treme example of this can be observed upon overexpression of Clk / STY kinase , or addition of SRPK1 kinase to permeabilized cells ( Gui et al . 1994a ; Gui et al . 1994b ) , which results in the complete redistribution of splicing factors from speckles to the diffuse nuclear pool ( Col - will et al . 1996 ; Sacco - Bubulya et al . 2002 ) . Interestingly , expression of a mutant form of Clk / STY that lacks its catalytic activity re - sulted in an increased accumulation of factors in highly concentrated foci on the periphery of speckles , possibly a reﬂection of their inabil - ity to be released ( Sacco - Bubulya et al . 2002 ) . Consistent with this observation , the addition of kinase inhibitors to cells resulted in an inhib - ition of the dynamic movements on the peri - phery of speckles ( Misteli et al . 1997a ) . Also , protein phosphatase 1 ( PP1 ) inhibitors resulted in enlarged irregularly shaped speckles with less well deﬁned edges , probably resulting from the inability of factors to be released from PFs , on the periphery of IGCs , also consistent with a modulating effect on the exchange rate ( Misteli et al . 1996 ) . In summary , a basal exchange rate of fac - tors , coupled with a mechanism to modulate this rate ( that is , providing a stimulus - induced burst ) , ensures that the needed factors , in the correct phosphorylation state , are available to pre - mRNA transcripts at the sites of transcrip - tion . In addition , such a mechanism ensures that a signiﬁcant population of factors , which are not functionally needed , are sequestered out of the soluble nuclear pool , in this case in nuclear speckles , representing a basic mecha - nism for the organization of nonmembrane - bound nuclear organelles . CONCLUSIONS Nuclear speckles are organelles located in the interchromatin nuclear space and are among the most widely studied nuclear domains . They are best known for accumulating high local con - centrations of snRNPs and other non - snRNP protein splicing factors . However , the presence in speckles of many other factors involved in mRNA production by RNA polymerase II fur - ther supports their intimate relationship with gene expression . Although most speckles appa - rently do not contain DNA in an analogous way to the rRNA gene repeats within nucleoli , none - theless highly expressed genes can be found associated with speckles , consistent with an important role for speckles in coordinating the supply and / or recycling of pre - mRNA process - ing and transcription factors . The analysis of nuclear speckles has helped to establish some key paradigms and principles for the dynamic assembly of membrane - free organelles in the nucleus . We anticipate that future work will reﬁne our understanding of speckle composi - tion and of mechanisms involved in targeting proteins to speckles and regulating their forma - tion . It is likely that building a detailed model of gene expression in vivo will require further D . L . Spector and A . I .
