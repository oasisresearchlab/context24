Several studies indicated that children seem to be less frequently infected with SARS - CoV - 2 and potentially less contagious . To examine the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 we combined both RT - PCR testing and serology in children in the most affected region in France , during the COVID - 19 epidemic . Methods . From April 14 , 2020 to May 12 , 2020 , we conducted a cross - sectional prospective , multicenter study . Healthy controls and pauci - symptomatic children from birth to age 15 years were enrolled by 27 ambulatory pediatricians . A nasopharyngeal swab was taken for detection of SARS - CoV - 2 by RT - PCR and a microsample of blood for micro - method serology . Results . Among the 605 children , 322 ( 53 . 2 % ) were asymptomatic and 283 ( 46 . 8 % ) symptomatic . RT - PCR testing and serology were positive for 11 ( 1 . 8 % ) and 65 ( 10 . 7 % ) of all children , respectively . Only 3 children were RT - PCR – positive without any antibody response have been detected . The frequency of positivity on RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 was significantly higher in children with positive serology than those with a negative one ( 12 . 3 % vs 0 . 6 % , p < 0 . 001 ) . Contact with a person with proven COVID - 19 increased the odds of positivity on RT - PCR ( OR 7 . 8 , 95 % confidence interval [ 1 . 5 ; 40 . 7 ] ) and serology ( 15 . 1 [ 6 . 6 ; 34 . 6 ] ) . Conclusion . In area heavily affected by COVID - 19 , after the peak of the first epidemic wave and during the lockdown , the rate of children with positive SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR was very low ( 1 . 8 % ) , but the rate of positive on serology was higher ( 10 . 7 % ) . Most of PCR positive children had at the same time , positive serology suggesting a low risk of transmission . .

Worldwide , the number of confirmed pediatric cases seems relatively low , and they account for less than 1 % of hospitalized cases and deaths [ 1 , 4 ] . Although most COVID - 19 cases in children are not severe , with mild clinical symptoms , serious COVID - 19 illness resulting in hospitalization can occur in this age group , and recently , hyperinflammatory shock , showing features similar to atypical Kawasaki disease and Kawasaki disease shock syndrome , were reported [ 5 ] . However , concerns have been raised that children could play an important role in the spread of the disease because community testing has demonstrated a significant number of children with no or subclinical symptoms [ 6 ] . Indeed , if as for influenza , children could be the primary drivers of household SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , then a silent spread from children who did not alert anyone to their infection could be a serious driver in the dynamics of the epidemic . On the basis of this prevailing hypothesis but without evidence , school closures were implemented almost ubiquitously around the world to try to halt the potential spread of COVID - 19 despite early modelling suggesting that this would have less impact than most other non - pharmacological interventions [ 7 , 8 ] . However , several studies had already shown that when SARS - CoV - 2 infection was suspected ( compatible clinical signs , contact with a person with COVID - 19 ) , the rate of positivity on RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 was lower in children than adults [ 8 ] . In France , during the first epidemic wave , the SARS - CoV - 2 – positive rate was about 2 - to 7 - fold less for children than adults [ 9 ] . In contrast , in RT - PCR SARS - CoV - 2 – positive children , the viral load was comparable between children and adults [ 10 ] . However , results from a systematic review of household clusters of COVID - 19 revealed that only 3 / 31 clusters were due to a child index case , and a population - based school contact - tracing study found minimal .

Finally , other studies suggested that children were potentially less contagious than adults , with very few secondary cases involving young patients [ 10 , 13 , 14 ] . Some countries such as South Korea and Iceland have implemented widespread community testing . Both countries found children significantly underrepresented in cases . In Iceland , this was true in targeted testing of high - risk groups as compared with adults ( 6 . 7 % < 10 years vs 13 . 7 % ≥ 10 years positive ) , and in ( invited ) population screening , no child under 10 years old was positive for SARS - CoV - 2 as compared with 0 . 8 % in the general population [ 15 ] . Of note , all these studies were based on RT - PCR testing , but serology diagnosis is also an important tool to better understand the spread and burden of COVID - 19 [ 16 ] . A serology survey tested adolescents in a high school in the north of France , the site of a cluster at the end of February . Of the 242 students tested , 2 . 7 % of adolescents ≤ 14 years old and 40 % aged 15 - 17 years were positive on SARS - CoV - 2 serology ( IgG ) , which suggests a difference in susceptibility among younger adolescents [ 17 ] . To best approach the spread and dynamics of transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in children at a population level , we combined both RT - PCR testing for SARS - CoV - 2 and serology in asymptomatic or pauci - symptomatic children ( with mild clinical symptoms ) in the Paris area , the most affected region in France , during the COVID - 19 epidemic . Patients and Methods Study population This was a cross - sectional prospective , multicenter study conducted by the Association Clinique et Thérapeutique Infantile du Val de Marne ( ACTIV ) network , a research unit expert in epidemiological surveillance and clinical studies in ambulatory pediatric infectious .

Primary care pediatric private practices ( n = 27 ) took part in the study from April 14 , 2020 to May 12 , 2020 . The strategy of closing schools and the lockdown decided by the French government for the whole country started on March 17 and finished on May 11 , 2020 . This study aimed to enroll children from birth to 15 years of age consulting an ambulatory pediatrician and distributed in two groups : healthy controls ( asymptomatic ) and pauci - symptomatic children with mild clinical symptoms . Asymptomatic children were defined as children without any symptoms or signs suggesting infectious disease . Moreover , in the asymptomatic group , we defined a subgroup of children who had symptoms ( fever or respiratory or digestive ) more than 7 days before enrolment . Children with symptoms were defined as those with fever isolated or associated with respiratory signs such as cough , dysphagia , rhinorrhea , diarrhea , vomiting , cutaneous signs , taste loss and / or anosmia . Children were excluded if the clinical condition at enrolment required transfer to pediatric emergency unit or hospitalization . After informing the parents of the participating children and obtaining their signed consent , an electronic case report form ( eCRF ) was completed by the pediatrician to collect socio - demographic data , history , contact with a person with confirmed COVID - 19 , clinical symptoms and signs , and additional positive biological tests . We have also collected suspected COVID - 19 contacts , because during the lockdown the diagnostic RT - PCR SARS - CoV - 2 test was mainly available for patients with severe disease and / or healthcare workers , and all symptomatic individuals could not be tested . For all enrolled children , during the same visit , a nasopharyngeal ( NP ) swab was taken for RT - PCR detection of SARS - CoV - 2 and a microsample of blood for micro - method serology .

Serological assays Pediatricians collected fingerstick whole - blood specimens and used the Biosynex COVID - 19 BSS test , a rapid chromatographic immunoassay , for qualitive detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS - CoV - 2 in blood . This test is among those approved by the French national health authority [ 19 ] . According to the specifications of the manufacturer , the diagnostic accuracy of the test was sensitivity 91 . 8 % [ 95 % CI 83 . 8 - 96 . 6 ] and specificity 99 . 2 % [ 95 % CI 97 . 7 - 99 . 8 ] ( https : / / www . biosynex . com / laboratoires - hopitaux - tests - covid - 19 / ) . Furthermore , assessment by independent investigators confirmed the good diagnostic accuracy of this test among hospital staff with mild disease in eastern France [ 20 ] . Positive serology was defined as a case positive for IgM and negative for IgG or positive for IgM and IgG or negative for IgM and positive for IgG . All other cases were considered to have negative serology results . SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR methods The NP specimens were obtained by using the collection system eSwab TM ( Minitip size nylon flocked swab placed in 1 mL of modified liquid Amies transport medium , COPAN , Brescia , Italy ) . They were transported within 48 hours to the centralized microbiology laboratory ( CHIC ) . Before extraction , each NP sample was inactivated by the addition of 750 µl / ml of STARmag lysis buffer solution ( Seegene , South Korea ) . The RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 was performed on the automated Seegene STARlet system® , according to the manufacturer ' s .

In brief , the automated Hamilton STARlet system was used for automated viral RNA extraction using the STARMag 96 Universal Cartridge kit ( Seegene , South Korea ) and PCR set up . Subsequently , 8 μ L of extracted nucleic acids was added to 17 μ L of the PCR Master Mix , and amplification and detection were performed on the CFX96 TM detection system ( Bio - Rad , France ) as per manufacturer’s instruction . Ct from FAM ( E gene ) , Cal Red 610 ( RDRP gene ) , Quasar 670 ( N gene ) and HEX ( internal control ) were acquired . Before extraction , internal control ( 10 µl ) was added to each reaction mix to verify extraction and determine PCR inhibition . Positive and negative controls were included in each run . NP samples were considered positive when a cycle threshold value ( C t ) less than 40 was obtained for any gene . A sample was considered negative if the internal control was amplified but not the viral target genes . A sample was considered invalid when no amplification was obtained for the internal control . The C t values were used as indicators of the copy number of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in specimens with lower C t values corresponding to higher viral copy numbers . Statistical analysis Data were entered by using the eCRF ( PHP / MySQL ) and analyzed by using Stata / SE v15 ( StataCorp , College Station , TX , USA ) . Quantitative data were compared by Student t test and qualitative data by chi - square or Fisher exact test . We used a logistic regression model for analysis of factors associated with positivity on RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 and serology .

Only significant variables ( p < 0 . 05 ) were kept in the final model . All tests were 2 - sided and were considered significant at p < 0 . 05 . Ethics The study protocol was approved by an ethics committee ( CPP IDF IX no . 08 - 022 ) . Parents of all infants provided written informed consent . The study was registered at ClinicalTrials . gov NCT04318431 . Results From April 14 , 2020 to May 12 , 2020 , 27 ambulatory pediatricians in the Paris area enrolled 605 children : 322 ( 53 . 2 % ) were asymptomatic and 283 ( 46 . 8 % ) symptomatic . Table 1 presents the characteristics of the enrolled children by group . The mean duration from symptom onset to enrollment was 12±15 days ( median 5 ) for symptomatic children . Among asymptomatic children , 118 ( 37 % ) had history of symptoms during the preceding weeks but more than 7 days before enrolment ( mean 40 ±22 days ; median 36 ) . Mean age was 4 . 9 ± 3 . 9 years ( median 3 . 8 ) with no significant difference between the two groups . In the symptomatic group , the main signs and symptoms were fever ( 187 , 66 . 3 % ) , cough ( 143 , 50 . 7 % ) , pharyngitis ( 143 , 50 . 7 % ) , rhinitis ( 137 , 48 . 4 % ) , diarrhea ( 81 , 28 . 7 % ) , cutaneous criteria ( 64 , 23 . 0 % ) , vomiting ( 52 , 18 . 8 % ) , taste loss ( 8 , 3 . 0 % ) and anosmia ( 5 , 3 . 3 % ) . Figure 1 presents the dynamics of the first COVID - 19 epidemic wave in France [ 21 ] , the dates of the lockdown and the number of children enrolled by weeks . RT - PCR SARS - CoV - 2 tests were positive for 11 ( 1 . 8 % ) children , with no significant difference between the two groups ( Table 2 ) . The supplemental Table shows the details of the 11 positive RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 . Only 5 children had positive RT - PCR SARS - CoV - 2 .

On multivariable analysis , contact with a person with COVID - 19 household was the only significant risk factor for RT - PCR – positive SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( OR 7 . 8 , 95 % CI [ 1 . 5 ; 40 . 7 ] ) . Table 2 shows also the serology results by group . Serology was positive for 65 ( 10 . 7 % ) children , whatever the group , and among these , 87 . 3 % had a confirmed or suspected contact . The rates of confirmed or suspected contact among the positive serology cases ( n = 65 ) did not change during the study period . Table 3 presents the results of RT - PCR SARS - CoV - 2 and serology in the asymptomatic group by history of symptoms and signs during the preceding weeks . Children with history of symptoms during the preceding weeks , more frequently were positive on serology . Table 4 presents the RT - PCR SARS - CoV - 2 results by serology status . The frequency of positivity on RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 was significantly higher in children with positive serology than those with a negative one ( 12 . 3 % vs 0 . 6 % , p < 0 . 001 ) . Only 3 children were RT - PCR SARS - CoV - 2 – positive without any antibody response detected . Table 5 shows RT - PCR SARS - CoV - 2 and serology positivity by contact with a person with suspected or confirmed COVID - 19 . Only 2 of 275 ( 0 . 7 % ) children without any contact with a person with COVID - 19 were positive on RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 . On multivariate analysis , positivity on serology was associated with contact with a person with proven or suspected COVID - 19 ( OR 15 . 1 [ 95 % CI 6 . 6 ; 34 . 6 ] and 5 . 8 [ 95 % CI 2 . 6 ; 13 . 2 ] ) .

In a region strongly affected by the epidemic ( Paris area ) but during the lockdown , very few children ( 1 . 8 % ) were positive on RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 , but the rate of children positive on serology ( 10 . 7 % ) was higher . Despite the relatively large number of children included ( > 600 ) , we did not find a significant difference in the rate of positive RT - PCR or serology results between asymptomatic and pauci - symptomatic children . This fact supports that it is unlikely the cluster screening of symptomatic children in the community will be relevant . Among asymptomatic children , those with history of symptoms during the preceding weeks accounted for one third of children with positive serology results ( 13 / 41 ) , which supports that asymptomatic infections are frequent in children . In contrast , history of symptoms during the preceding weeks increased significantly the risk of positive serology . However , on multivariate analysis , the only factor influencing the positivity of RT - PCR or serology was the household contact who has previously presented symptoms suggestive of COVID - 19 . This was noted whether this infection was proven by RT - PCR or unproven due to the absence of availability of the test . Of note , the number of siblings in the family did not significantly increase the probability of a positive RT - PCR or serology result . This finding suggests that children were usually infected by an adult in the family [ 11 ] . Without contact with a suspected or confirmed COVID - 19 case , the frequency of positivity on RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 or serology was extremely low : 0 . 7 % for RT - PCR and 2 . 9 % for serology . Of the children positive on RT - PCR ( n = 11 ) , only 3 had no antibody response , and 8 were positive for IgG with or without IgM positivity . This finding supports that for these 3 patients , contamination had occurred during the 2 weeks before enrollment . .

This finding highlights the difficulties in interpreting the significance of a positive RT - PCR SARS - CoV - 2 result without concomitant antibody testing after the epidemic wave . Indeed , children positive on RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 and positive for IgG probably had little or no infectivity [ 22 ] . In a study of 9 patients , attempts to isolate the virus in culture were not successful beyond day 8 of illness onset , which relates to the decreased infectivity beyond the first week [ 23 ] . In the study of Bullard et al . , SARS - CoV - 2 Vero cell infectivity was only observed for RT - PCR Ct < 24 and symptom onset to test < 8 days [ 24 ] . The low infectivity is also supported in our study by the fact that only 5 children had positive RT - PCR SARS - CoV - 2 result for all 3 amplified genes , among which only two children presented C t between 27 and 30 , suggesting not very high viral load . Our study has several limitations . First , the role of assumed household transmission probably has been over - estimated because of the well - followed lockdown in France [ 25 ] . Indeed , more than 86 . 5 % of children with positive SARS - CoV - 2 by RT - PCR or serology have had a confirmed or suspected COVID - 19 household contact . Second , our rate of positive serology possibly does not reflect the epidemiologic situation in the Paris area for children . Probably because COVID - 19 families already affected were more likely to consult and agree to participate in the study , the population of parents of enrolled children were possibly over - represented of COVID - 19 – affected families as compared with the general population . Indeed , we found , 17 . 1 % of the children included had a confirmed infected close relative and 32 . 3 % had contact with a person household with suspected infection ( without testing ) . Estimates of the rate of patients who were infected with SARS - Cov - 2 in the Paris area was lower , close to 12 % [ 26 ] . .

The importance of familial contagion in the modalities of SARS - Cov - 2 transmission is underlined by a very low RT - PCR ( 0 . 7 % ) and serology positivity rate ( 3 . 6 % ) for children without an infected relative and in a period of lockdown . School closure or limitation ( reduced number of students or days of attendance ) has a major impact on children ' s development and access to learning [ 27 ] . Therefore , the usefulness of school closure or limitation needs evaluation in controlling the COVID - 19 epidemic . Available data suggest that the role of children in the dynamics of the adult epidemic is probably modest , but further studies are necessary . We plan to renew this study after the re - opening of schools and day care centre in the Paris area to better assess the transmission of SARS - Cov - 2 in children . Funding .
