Molecular Mechanism of Multivesicular Body Biogenesis by ESCRT Complexes Thomas Wollert and James H . Hurley Laboratory of Molecular Biology , National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases , National Institutes of Health , U . S . Department of Health and Human Services , Bethesda , MD 20892 Abstract When internalized receptors and other cargo are destined for lysosomal degradation , they are ubiquitinated and sorted by the ESCRT complexes 0 , I , II , and III into multivesicular bodies . Multivesicular bodies are formed when cargo - rich patches of the limiting membrane of endosomes bud inward by an unknown mechanism and are then cleaved to yield cargo - bearing intralumenal vesicles . The biogenesis of multivesicular bodies was reconstituted and visualized using giant unilamellar vesicles , fluorescent ESCRT - 0 , I , II , and III complexes , and a membrane - tethered fluorescent ubiquitin fusion as a model cargo . ESCRT - 0 forms domains of clustered cargo but does not deform membranes . ESCRT - I and II in combination deform the membrane into buds , in which cargo is confined . ESCRT - I and II localize to the bud necks , and recruit ESCRT - 0 - ubiquitin domains to the buds . ESCRT - III subunits localize to the bud neck and efficiently cleave the buds to form intralumenal vesicles . Intralumenal vesicles produced in this reaction contain the model cargo but are devoid of ESCRTs . The observations explain how the ESCRTs direct membrane budding and scission from the cytoplasmic side of the bud without being consumed in the reaction . It was shown thirty years ago that following stimulation , internalized EGF receptor localized to multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) of human cells within minutes 1 . Multivesicular bodies subsequently fuse with lysosomes where their contents are degraded 2 , 3 . Downregulation of cell surface receptors and transporters in yeast occurs by the same pathway , and yeast genetics identified the machinery responsible , now known as the ESCRT complexes 4 – 7 . The ESCRTs also function in membrane remodeling reactions in the budding of HIV - 1 and other enveloped viruses from the plasma membrane 8 – 10 , and in the cleavage of the membrane neck between dividing cells from humans 11 , 12 to a subset of Archaea 13 . The ESCRT - III complex is required for MVB biogenesis , viral budding , and cytokinesis , and is responsible for the membrane cleavage step in the detachment of membrane buds into the lumen of the MVB 14 .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t MVB pathway . The upstream complexes ESCRT - 0 , I , and II contain ubiquitin ( Ub ) - binding domains ( UBDs ) which are responsible for interactions with ubiquitinated cargo 15 , 16 . ESCRT - III proteins are capable of forming tubular structures 17 – 19 , membrane evaginations 20 , and budded intralumenal vesicles ( ILVs ) 14 in vitro or when overexpressed in cells . Most current thinking about the origin of membrane buds in MVBs has centered on the role of the ESCRT - III proteins 21 . The attraction of these models is that ESCRT - III - induced buds have been directly observed in overexpression systems and in vitro . A major drawback to these models is that there is no satisfactory explanation of how ESCRT - III proteins can be rescued and recycled from self - induced buds . ESCRT - mediated membrane budding has been difficult to analyze in cells because deletion or knockdown of any of the essential ESCRT genes , whether upstream or downstream , leads to the formation of the aberrant class E compartment 7 , 22 . By electron microscopy , the class E compartment induced by deletion of subunits of ESCRT - 0 , - I , - II , and – III consists of stacked cisternae that are devoid of intralumenal vesicles 23 – 25 ( G . Odorizzi , personal communication ) . These difficulties in resolving the mechanism of MVB biogenesis in vivo motivated us and others to reconstitute the pathway for analysis in vitro 14 , 26 , 27 . Using reconstitution in giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) , we now show that ESCRT - I and II together induce buds by stabilizing the bud neck . They recruit the ESCRT - III subunits Vps20 and Snf7 to the neck , but not the lumen of the bud , such that the bud can be cleaved from the exterior end of the neck with no loss of ESCRT complexes to the interior . Further , we find that ESCRT - 0 forms large clusters of Ub on the membrane surface that are recruited to the bud necks by the ESCRT - I - II supercomplex . These observations provide the basis for a molecular mechanism of MVB biogenesis and cargo sorting that is fully consistent with biological observations . Cargo clustering by ESCRT - 0 Because the upstream ESCRT complexes contain UBDs , we wished to investigate whether they clustered ubiquitinated cargo , by analogy to other coat and adaptor systems in trafficking . In order to create a model system for endosomal cargo sorting , the C - terminus of Ub was fused to green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) or cyan fluorescent protein ( CFP ) , and was tethered through an N - terminal polyhistidine tag to GUVs incorporating the Ni 2 + - chelating lipid DOGS - NTA ( Fig . 1a ) . Labeled yeast ESCRT - 0 was found to co - localize with Ub in patches of up to 5 µm across ( Fig . 1a ) . The increase in fluorescence of the rhodamine - PE membrane marker is due to clustering of the acidic dye with the basic tag on the cargo , as this effect is not seen when the uncharged membrane reporter BODIPY - PC is used ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . The ability of ESCRT - 0 to cluster Ub is consistent with its pentavalent Ub binding through three UIMs and two VHS domains 28 – 32 ( Ren & Hurley , submitted ) . Ub clustering is abrogated by the Ub mutation I44D ( Fig . 1b ) , which disrupts the interaction with the UBDs of ESCRT - 0 33 , 34 . This shows that Ub clustering is mediated by the direct interaction between Ub and the UBDs of ESCRT - 0 . ESCRT - 0 clustered on the membrane in domains whose size and number were enhanced by , but not completely dependent on , binding to Ub ( Fig . 1c ) . This indicates that ESCRT - 0 has an intrinsic ability to cluster on membranes . On the other hand , the clustering of Ub itself Wollert and Hurley Page 2 Nature .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t depends absolutely on the integrity of the Ub Ile44 patch ( Fig . 1d ) , consistent with the direct role of the ESCRT - 0 UBDs . ESCRT - 0 subunit Hrs contains a clathrin - binding motif 35 and localizes to extended , flat clathrin coats on endosomes 36 . Our observations suggest that lateral self - organization is an intrinsic property of ESCRT - 0 , although it might be augmented or stabilized in the presence of clathrin . In contrast , isolated yeast ESCRT - I or II , which have two and one known UBDs , respectively 4 , 15 , 16 , 37 , 38 , do not cluster Ub by themselves ( Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) , although as described below , the combination of the two together sometimes manifested small punctate Ub clusters . We infer from these data that ESCRT - 0 is the main driving force for cargo clustering in the pathway . ESCRT - I and II induce membrane bud formation and confine cargo A central motivation for this study was to discover how the limiting membrane buds into MVBs . Addition of 15 nM each of ESCRT - I and – II together evaginated the membrane into numerous cargo - containing buds ( Fig . 2a , b ) , although no single ESCRT complex by itself generated buds ( Fig . 1a , 2c , Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . The lumens of the GUVs were devoid of ILVs . The presence or absence of the upstream ESCRT - 0 complex or the downstream ESCRT - III protein Vps20 did not markedly alter the number or character of buds formed ( Fig . 2c , Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , indicating that budding is a distinct activity of the ESCRT - I and – II pair . The presence of cargo was not required for ESCRT - I and II mediated budding ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . In contrast to ESCRT - I and II , which induce buds even at concentrations below their estimated levels in yeast cells ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , physiological concentrations of ESCRT - III subunits do not produce buds ( Fig . 2c , Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . We attribute our previous observation of ESCRT - III - induced buds 14 to the presence of up to 40 - fold higher concentrations of subunits than used in this study . The affinities of isolated ESCRT UBDs for Ub are in the range of Kd = 200 µM or lower , yet physiological ESCRT substrates are thought to typically be present in nM concentrations . Using 65 nM Ub - GFP , we assessed the ability of the upstream yeast ESCRTs to reduce the mobility of membrane - tethered Ub by FRAP microscopy . Ub - GFP in the limiting membrane quickly recovered following photobleaching ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Exchange with Ub - GFP in bulk solution occurs under these experimental conditions , as a GUV photobleached in its entirety still was able to recover . About half of the cargo within ESCRT - 0 Ub domains underwent exchange ( Fig . 2d , e ) . The presence of ESCRT - I and II slowed the exchange of the mobile fraction by a factor of three , but did not alter the proportion of cargo capable of exchange . Cargo within the buds did not recover detectable fluorescence on the time scale of the experiment , regardless of the presence of ESCRT - 0 ( Fig . 2d , e , Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Therefore cargo is confined within the buds . The bud necks are still open to exchange with bulk solution ( Supplementary Fig . 7 , rows 2 – 4 ) , so closure of the neck is not responsible for cargo confinement . These results indicate the cargo in the buds does not efficiently exchange through either lateral diffusion in the membrane or through the soluble phase . Wollert and Hurley Page 3 Nature .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t ESCRT - I and II localize to the necks of membrane buds ESCRT - I and ESCRT - II were diffusely localized in the absence of other ESCRTs ( Fig . 2a , b ) , with ESCRT - I sporadically visible in concentrations at bud necks ( data not shown ) . Addition of Vps20 , the ESCRT - II binding subunit of ESCRT - III , strongly enhanced the localization of ESCRT - I and II at membrane buds without noticeably affecting the number or size of the buds . In the presence of Vps20 , ESCRT - I ( Fig . 3a ) and ESCRT - II ( Fig . 3b ) were clearly visualized at membrane necks . No concentrations of ESCRT - I or II could be seen within the evaginated membrane buds . Tethered Ub was present within the evaginations and clustered in bright punctate structures at the neck connecting the evagination to the limiting membrane . The puncta of ESCRT - I and II co - localized with the bright puncta of Ub . The main conclusion derived from this experiment is that physiological low nM amounts of ESCRT - I and II produce extensive budding of membrane into the GUV lumen , without themselves entering the lumen . Rather , ESCRT - I and II localize to the neck of the bud , suggesting that they produce buds by inducing and stabilizing the bud necks . Colocalization of Ub domains and membrane buds by ESCRT - 0 , - I , and - II Having found that the upstream ESCRTs collectively carried out the key functions of Ub - cargo clustering and membrane budding , we sought to determine how these functions were coordinated . Labeled ESCRT - 0 and Ub - CFP were monitored in the context of unlabelled ESCRT - I and II . ESCRT - I and II produced membrane buds , as seen also in the absence of ESCRT - 0 . The size and number of membrane buds did not change markedly from those generated in the absence of ESCRT - 0 ( Fig . 2c ) . Nor did the size and number of ESCRT - 0 - Ub domains markedly change upon addition of ESCRT - I and II ( Fig . 1b ) . Most ESCRT - 0 - Ub domains were found co - localized with membrane buds ( Fig . 4a ) . Co - localization of both buds with clusters and clusters with buds was sharply reduced in a mutant ESCRT - 0 ( ΔP ( S / T ) XP ) 39 , 40 that blocked the interaction between ESCRT - 0 and – I ( Fig . 4b , c ) . There were fewer ESCRT - 0 - Ub domains observed than membrane buds , probably because each ESCRT - 0 domain involves more complexes than each membrane bud . Only 50 % of membrane buds were associated with ESCRT - 0 domains ( Fig . 4c ) , consistent with the greater number of buds . However , 80 % of the ESCRT - 0 domains colocalized with at least one membrane bud ( Fig . 4c ) . This observation confirms that the division of labor apparent for the isolated complexes or binary combinations , in which ESCRT - 0 clusters cargo while ESCRT - I and II generate membrane buds , holds even when all three of the complexes are present simultaneously . ESCRT - I - II bud necks recruit ESCRT - III subunits and activate scission We previously reported that ESCRT - III subunits Vps20 , Snf7 , and Vps24 , added in that order , had the intrinsic ability to scaffold their own bud neck and then cleave them 14 . We sought to determine if the necks of buds scaffolded by ESCRT - I and II were competent to recruit ESCRT - III subunits , and if they supported ESCRT - III - mediated scission . The Vps20 subunit of ESCRT - III directly binds to and is activated by ESCRT - II on membranes 41 , 42 . In the presence of Vps20 , little or no membrane scission is observed , consistent with the absence of ESCRT - III subunit Snf7 , a critical scission factor ( Fig . 5a ) .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t conditions , except with unlabelled ESCRT - II , labeled Vps20 also localizes to bud necks . Labeled Vps20 is wholly absent from the membrane in the interior of the buds , and appears to be confined to the neck by its strong interaction with ESCRT - II . When labeled Snf7 is added to unlabelled ESCRT - 0 , - I , - II and Vps20 , it is observed to colocalize with membrane necks and to be completely excluded from the interior membrane in the buds ( Fig . 5b ) . Moreover , numerous ILVs are seen in the lumen of the GUV , indicating that scission of the membrane necks is occurring ( Fig . 5c , Supplementary Fig . 7 , row 5 ) . This reaction occurs efficiently with only 15 nM of each component , while previous in vitro scission conditions lacking ESCRT - 0 and – I required thirteen - fold more Snf7 in the presence of three - fold more ESCRT - II 42 , or forty - fold more Snf7 in the absence of any upstream ESCRT complexes 14 . ILVs generated in this reaction contain Ub - CFP , but are completely devoid of Snf7 . The slowed reaction allowed us to visualize what we believe to be intermediates in the scission reaction , where Snf7 is localized to the bud necks and is poised for , or in the process of , severing the necks . When the third subunit important for scission , Vps24 , was added , scission was efficient . Essentially all of the ILVs were detached from the limiting membrane ( Supplementary Fig . 7 , row 6 ) , as expected . Discussion The observations in this study reveal a clear - cut division of labor between the ESCRT complexes . ESCRT - 0 is primarily responsible for cargo clustering , the ESCRT - I - II supercomplex for membrane budding and cargo sequestration in buds , and ESCRT - III for scission . The ESCRT - 0 subunit Hrs is a component of flat coats with clathrin on endosomes prior to their maturation into MVBs 36 . Such stiff , flat structures would seem to inhibit to formation of membrane buds . Having observed that ESCRT - I and – II membrane buds are associated with the edge of ESCRT - 0 - Ub domains in vitro , it now seems likely that in cells , buds form at the edge of an extended clathrin - ESCRT - 0 coat 16 . This suggests a model in which a large ESCRT - 0 - clathrin domain could serve as a cargo reservoir for buds spawned at the domain boundary . The driving force for cargo migration from the ESCRT - 0 domain into the bud in the cellular setting remains to be discovered . The biggest surprise and insight is that membrane buds are generated by ESCRT - I and – II , not ESCRT - III , contrary to widespread expectation . The membrane budding generated by high concentrations of ESCRT - III proteins is probably a byproduct of the physics of any curved filament with a membrane binding capacity 43 . Rather , a supercomplex of ESCRT - I and II is responsible for membrane budding . The intimate cooperation of these two complexes , which act on the membrane as a single activity , is consistent with their high affinity for one another 44 , co - assembly on membranes 45 and co - operativity in Ub - cargo interactions 37 . ESCRT - I and – II are sufficient to sequester cargo in the buds , on the basis of FRAP analysis . It has been suggested that cargo is confined by a fence composed of ESCRT - III subunits 46 . The present observations suggest that while ESCRT - III may abet cargo sequestration by stabilizing the ESCRT - I - II bud neck assembly and cleaving ILVs , ESCRT - I and – II are primarily responsible .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t The lack of ESCRTs in the interior membrane of the buds shows that ESCRT – I and – II do not template buds by forming an interior coat . In other words , the ESCRTs do not act like “inside out” clathrin or COPII . The ILVs observed in this study are on the order of 2 µm in diameter , as compared to 25 nm for the largest molecular dimension of ESCRT - I , and mean diameters of 56 and 24 nm for human and yeast ILVs , respectively 25 , 47 . The disparity between in vitro and in vivo ILV sizes , and the absence of interior localized ESCRT - I and – II argues against the suggestion that ESCRT structures template ILV size 45 . Other factors , notably tension and bending modulus , need to be considered . ESCRT - I and ESCRT - II ( particularly as complexed with Vps20 ) contain multiple points of contact with membranes that are separated from each other by rigid stalks on the order of 15 nm 42 , 45 , 48 , 49 . These separations correspond to reasonable dimensions for a membrane neck . In the reconstitution reported here , scission occurs with minimal or no internalization of ESCRTs . There have been no consistent reports of ESCRTs localized within MVBs , and all available evidence shows that to the contrary , ESCRTs are continuously recycled and used in multiple rounds of scission . When ILV budding and scission is driven in vitro by ESCRT - III alone , ESCRT - III was localized both within and outside ILVs , and the portion localized within was consumed in the reaction . In the presence of ESCRT - I and – II , ESCRT - III stays outside the bud , consistent with observations in cells . The unusual ability of ESCRT - III to cleave from outside the bud depends on its restricted localization to the neck . ESCRT - III has been visualized at midbodies connecting dividing cells 11 , 12 , and ESCRT - III has been modeled as an interior collar capable of severing the neck from within 50Similarly , it has been widely expected that ESCRT - III would form a collar lining the inside of the neck of nascent HIV - 1 virions where they attach to the plasma membrane of T - lymphocytes and macrophages 9 , 10 , 19 , and at the connection between the limiting membrane of the MVB and nascent ILVs 15 , 21 . In this regard , it is satisfying to directly visualize ESCRT - III localization to the neck of budding ILVs . These observations are consistent with the concept that ESCRT - III severs nascent HIV - 1 virions from the plasma membrane , and cuts membranous connections between dividing cells , through the same type of neck - constricting activity . In summary , ubiquitinated cargo sorting into MVBs by the ESCRTs has been reconstituted using purified components in a reaction that mirrors the known biological properties of the pathway and violates none of them . ESCRT - 0 forms large domains of clustered cargo , consistent with its polyvalent Ub binding and its known participation in flat clathrin coats in early endosomes , upstream of the rest of the ESCRT pathway ( Fig . 6a ) . ESCRT - I and – II , whose molecular function has been ill - defined , are responsible for membrane budding into the lumen of the MVB . ESCRT - I and II appear to act by an unusual mechanism in which their rigid multivalent membrane - binding structures may template the formation of bud necks ( Fig . 6c ) . We envision the large ESCRT - 0 - cargo domain acting as a cargo reservoir for a succession of smaller ESCRT - I - II buds until the cargo is all internalized and the coat disassembles . ESCRT - III has a highly restricted localization to the membrane neck and carries out scission efficiently even at low nanomolar concentrations ( Fig . 6d ) , confirming the concept of ESCRT - III as a scission machine for membrane necks .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t METHODS SUMMARY Protein purification and labeling The recombinant ESCRT - 0 complex was expressed in yeast and purified using Ni - NTA affinity chromatography and gel filtration ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . ESCRT - I , - II , Vps20 , and Snf7 were expressed in bacteria and purified as previously described 14 , 45 , 49 . ESCRT - 0 , - I , and – II were labeled with Alexa 488 on native Cys residues , and the engineered Vps20 N85C and Snf7 N - term Cys were labeled on introduced Cys residues . In vitro MVB biogenesis reactions GUVs were prepared essentially as described 14 with the addition of 5 % ( mol / mol ) Ni - NTA - DOGS and a corresponding reduction in the mole fraction of POPC . A 200 µl observation chamber ( Lab - Tek chambered # 1 . 0 Borosilicate ) was coated using 5 mg / ml BSA to avoid distortion of GUVs upon contact with the bottom of the chamber and rinsed with buffer ( 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7 . 4 , 300 mM NaCl ) . 100 µl of GUVs were incubated with 130 nM His 6 - GFP - Ub ( for FRAP experiments ) or His 6 - CFP - Ub ( for all other experiments ) for 15 min , mixed with 100 µl of the first ESCRT complex to be added ( 15 nM final concentration ) , and incubated for 5 min . The buffer and all proteins added to GUVs matched the osmolarity of the GUV solution ( ~ 650 mOsm due to evaporation of ~ 10 % water during electroformation at 60°C ) . The other ESCRT - complexes or ESCRT - III subunits were added to the GUV - buffer mixture to yield a final concentration of 15 nM . The solution was stirred to accelerate protein distribution and binding . All steps of protein addition were separated by 5 min incubation intervals at room temperature . One buffer control was performed for each experiment . This control was treated exactly like that of the actual experiment , however , only buffer and no ESCRT proteins was added . Stirring and incubation was the same for control and experiment . METHODS Lipids and dyes The following lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids : 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - L - serine ( POPS ) , 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( POPC ) , cholesterol , 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - [ ( N - ( 5 - amino - 1 - carboxypentyl ) iminodiacetic acid ) succinyl ] ( nickel salt ; Ni - NTA DOGS ) , 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine - N - ( lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl ) . Phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate diC16 ( PI ( 3 ) P ) was purchased from Echelon . Thiol - reactive Alexa ( Alexa Fluor 488 C5 maleimide ) and BODIPY - FL - C5 - HPC were from Molecular Probes . Cloning , expression and purification of proteins DNA encoding ESCRT - 0 subunits Hse1 and Vps27 was amplified by PCR from Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic DNA and cloned into the pESC - Ura yeast expression vector ( Stratagene ) . Hse1 was expressed fused to an N - terminal His 6 - tag followed by a TEV protease cleavage site . The construct was transformed into the protease deficient yeast strain DDY1810 ( a gift from Beverly Wendland , Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore ) . The yeast culture was grown to an OD at 600 nm of 0 . 8 in YNB supplemented with 2 % ( w / w ) Wollert and Hurley Page 7 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2010 October 08 .

Expression of ESCRT - 0 was induced by addition of 2 % ( w / w ) galactose , 20 g / l yeast extract , and 15 g / l bacto tryptone . The complex was expressed at 28°C for 16 hours and purified using Ni - NTA resin ( Qiagen ) and eluted with 100 mM imidazole . Elution fractions were cleaved using TEV - protease and further purified by gel filtration ( Superdex 200 column ) and a second affinity step ( Ni - NTA resin ) . Pooled fractions of ESCRT - 0 were concentrated to 7 µM , flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until use . The three PSDP - like motifs in Vps27 were mutated to AAAA ( positions 427 – 430 , 504 – 507 , and 561 – 564 ) using the QuickChange Multi site directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) and the mutant ESCRT - 0 complex was purified as described for the wild - type protein . The His 6 - Ub - GFP and CFP fusion proteins used in this study were the kind gift of Evzen Boura ( NIDDK , NIH ) . Full length yeast ESCRT - I and - II , subcloned into the pST39 vector , were transformed into Rosetta pLys cells and grown in LB - medium at 37°C until an optical density at 600 nm of 0 . 8 was reached . Expression was induced by addition of 0 . 5 mM IPTG at 18°C and the cultures were grown for an additional 16 hours . The complexes were purified by Ni - NTA affinity chromatography ( His6 - tag fused to Vps23 of ESCRT - I and Vps22 of ESCRT - II ) and the tags were removed by digesting elution fractions with Tev protease . The complexes were further purified using size exclusion chromatography ( Superdex 200 16 / 60 columns , GE Healthcare ) , with 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 and 300 mM NaCl as running buffer . Aliquots of all purified proteins were immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C . ESCRT - III subunits Vps20 and Snf7 were cloned into the pHis2 vector , containing MBP in between the His - tag and the TEV cleavage site . Cultures were grown at 37°C until an optical density at 600 nm of 0 . 8 , induced with 0 . 5 mM IPTG and incubated at 30°C for 3 hours . The MBP - fusion proteins were purified using Ni - NTA affinity chromatography and elution fractions were cleaved with TEV protease for 2 hours at room temperature . The digested fractions were subjected to size exclusion chromatography and further purified using a second affinity purification to remove traces of uncleaved protein and TEV protease . Snf7 was maintained at concentrations ~ 8µM and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen . Vps20 was concentrated to 20µM , frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until use . The His6 - Ub - GFP and CFP fusion proteins used in this study were the kind gift of Evzen Boura ( NIDDK , NIH ) . The I44D mutation was introduced using the QuickChange site directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) and the mutant was expressed and purified as described for the ESCRT - I and - II complexes . Fluorescent labeling of proteins To label Vps20 and Snf7 a cysteine residue was introduced by mutating Asn85 ( Vps20 ) or inserted at the N - terminus immediately after the start codon ( Snf7 ) using the QuickChange Mutagenesis Kit ( Stratagene ) according to the manufacturer ' s protocol . ESCRT - 0 , - I , and – II were labeled using their native Cys residues . The purified and concentrated proteins were labeled by incubating Alexa Fluor 488 C5 maleimide at a molar ratio of 1 : 1 with the protein at 30°C for one hour under a N 2 atomosphere . The labeled fraction was determined by running samples on an SDS - PA gel and fluorescence scans of the gel in a Typhoon variable mode imager ( GE - Healthcare ) using 488 nm excitation and 495 nm detection wavelengths . Quantification of labeling efficiency was achieved by separating excess of dye from labeled Wollert and Hurley Page 8 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2010 October 08 .

Preperation of giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) A thin film of lipid mixtures containing POPC ( 57 mol % ) , POPS ( 10 mol % ) , cholesterol ( 25 mol % ) , PI ( 3 ) P ( 3 mol % ) , Ni - NTA DOGS ( 5 mol % ) and lissamine - rhodamine - PE ( 0 . 1 mol % ) was applied to indium - tin oxide covered glass slides and placed into a self - made Teflon chamber . The glass slides were separated by a 2 mm thin glucose solution ( 600 mM ) and an AC electric field ( 1V , 10 Hz ) was applied for 4 h at 60°C following the previously described GUV electroformation protocol 51 . The GUVs were harvested after cooling down to room temperature and used immediately . In vitro MVB biogenesis reactions GUVs were prepared essentially as described 14 with the addition of 5 % ( mol / mol ) Ni - NTA - DOGS and a corresponding reduction in the mole fraction of POPC . A 200 µl observation chamber ( Lab - Tek chambered # 1 . 0 Borosilicate ) was coated using 5 mg / ml BSA to avoid distortion of GUVs upon contact with the bottom of the chamber and rinsed with buffer ( 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7 . 4 , 300 mM NaCl ) . 100 µl of GUVs were incubated with 130 nM His 6 - GFP - Ub ( for FRAP experiments ) or His 6 - CFP - Ub ( for all other experiments ) for 15 min , mixed with 100 µl of the first ESCRT complex to be added ( 15 nM final concentration ) , and incubated for 5 min . The buffer and all proteins added to GUVs matched the osmolarity of the GUV solution ( ~ 650 mOsm due to evaporation of ~ 10 % water during electroformation at 60°C ) . The other ESCRT - complexes or ESCRT - III subunits were added to the GUV - buffer mixture to yield a final concentration of 15 nM . The solution was stirred to accelerate protein distribution and binding . All steps of protein addition were separated by 5 min incubation intervals at room temperature . One buffer control was performed for each experiment . This control was treated exactly like that of the actual experiment , however , only buffer and no ESCRT proteins was added . Stirring and incubation was the same for control and experiment . Randomly chosen fields of view were evaluated to reveal the number of membrane buds and ILVs per GUV . Reactions were performed as described above and all GUVs in the particular fields of view were scanned in the z direction . All membrane buds or ILVs per GUV were counted , and for each experimental condition 80 to 100 GUVs were analyzed , except for results in Fig . 4c , which were based on 70 to 80 GUVs per experiment . Results were summarized in histograms . Histograms in figures show results from a single experiment . All experiments were repeated in triplicate yielding essentially identical numbers of buds and ILVs in each replicate . Confocal fluorescence microscopy Images were taken in multi - tracking mode on a Zeiss LSM510 or Confocor laser - scanning confocal microscope with a 63× Plan Apochromat 1 . 4 NA objective and a 488 / 543 or 458 dichroic mirror at a resolution of 512 × 512 pixel . The GFP / Alexa - 488 dyes or CFP were excited using the 488 nm or 458 nm line and rhodamine was excited with a 543 nm HeNe laser . GFP / Alexa488 emission was collected with a 505 – 530 nm bandpass filter and CFP using a 470 – 500 nm bandpass filter . Rhodamine emission was collected with a 560 nm Wollert and Hurley Page 9 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2010 October 08 .

The pinholes for each channel were set for an approximate 1 . 5 – 2 . 5 µm optical slice . Laser power was 9 µW for the 543 nm channel and 24 µW for the 458 and 488 nm channels . Images were analyzed using the LSM Examiner software . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching GUVs were incubated with His 6 - GFP - Ub and ESCRT complexes ( as indicated in Fig . 2 , S3 ) and as described above . Experiments were performed using a LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 63× Plan Apochromat 1 . 4 NA objective and a 488 / 543 dichroic mirror at a resolution of 124 × 124 pixel with three - fold zoom and an open pinhole . GFP was excited using the 488 nm laser line and 14 µW for imaging before and after bleaching . GFP fluorescence was bleached using 100 % laser power of the 458 nm , 488 nm , and 514 nm laser lines for 20 iterations . Recovery was observed by scanning at 488 nm every 149 msec for at least 50 sec . Fluorescence intensities were determined using the LSM Examiner software . For the analysis shown in Fig . 2 , 10 FRAP curves of 10 buds or clusters , respectively , from 10 different GUVs were used .
