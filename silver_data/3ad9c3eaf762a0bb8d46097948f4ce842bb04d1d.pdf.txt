We developed an integrative approach to reconstruct the 3D architecture of pro - tein complexes in vivo . We applied this approach to the exocyst , a hetero - octameric complex of un - known structure that is thought to tether secretory vesicles during exocytosis with a poorly understood mechanism . We engineered yeast cells to anchor the exocyst on deﬁned landmarks and determined the position of its subunit termini at nanometer precision using ﬂuorescence microscopy . We then integrated these positions with the structural properties of the subunits to reconstruct the exocyst together with a vesicle bound to it . The exocyst has an open hand conformation made of rod - shaped subunits that are interlaced in the core . The exocyst architecture explains how the complex can tether secretory vesi - cles , placing them in direct contact with the plasma membrane . INTRODUCTION A mechanistic understanding of the cell requires the structural characterization of its biological complexes . This information is lacking for most cellular complexes due to the limitations of con - ventional approaches . In addition , most methods requirepuriﬁca - tion of the complex and cannot determine the structure of com - plexes directly in the cellular environment . Thus , understanding the molecular mechanisms that mediate cellular processes re - quires the development of innovative hybrid approaches . Exocytosis delivers cargos in secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane and to the extracellular space . The exocyst complex is responsible for speciﬁcally tethering the secretory vesicles to the appropriate plasma membrane sites during exocytosis . Mu - tations of exocyst subunits result in the accumulation of exocytic vesicles in the cell . This suggests that the exocyst acts before the soluble N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor attachment protein re - ceptor ( SNAREs ) complex mediated fusion of the vesicle with the plasma membrane ( Heider and Munson , 2012 ; Novick et al . , 1980 ) . The exocyst is necessary for cell growth , cell polarity , and the correct development of cellular structures ( e . g . , primary cilia in renal cells ) ( Heider and Munson , 2012 ) . Exocyst malfunc - tion is associated with many pathologies , such as Polycystic Kid - ney Disease ( Fogelgren et al . , 2011 ) and cancer ( Sjo¨blom et al . , 2006 ; Yamamotoet al . , 2013 ) . Despite theimportance oftheexo - cyst , the lack of structural information has prevented addressing the molecular mechanisms of exocyst function and regulation . The exocyst is conserved throughout the eukaryotes and consists of one copy of each of its eight subunits ( 845 kDa in total ) : Sec3 , Sec5 , Sec6 , Sec8 , Sec10 , Sec15 , Exo70 , and Exo84 ( Heider et al . , 2016 ; Hsu et al . , 1996 ; TerBush et al . , 1996 ) . Several studies indicate that the exocyst binds to the secretory vesicle with Sec10 and Sec15 ( Guo et al . , 1999 ; Roth et al . , 1998 ; Wiederkehr et al . , 2004 ) , while Sec3 and Exo70 bind to exocytic sites at the plasma membrane ( Boyd et al . , 2004 ; Dong et al . , 2005 ; Finger et al . , 1998 ; Yamashita et al . , 2010 ) . However , it is still not known how the exocyst can bind both membranes simultaneously without interfering in the sub - sequent SNARE - mediated fusion . The information available on the overall exocyst structure is limited to quick - freeze deep - etch and negative stain electron microscopy ( Heider et al . , 2016 ; Hsu et al . , 1998 ) . These images showed that the exocyst is constituted of arms of different lengths , ranging from 10 – 35 nm , that join together at the core of the complex . However , the structure of the complex could not be determined . The crystal structures of the exocyst sub - units cover only 26 % of the whole complex ( Dong et al . , 2005 ; Hamburger et al . , 2006 ; Jin et al . , 2005 ; Sivaram et al . , 2006 ; Wu et al . , 2005 ; Yamashita et al . , 2010 ) . The structural data suggest that the subunits are rod shaped and formed by 400 Cell 168 , 400 – 412 , January 26 , 2017 ª 2017 Elsevier Inc . helical - bundle repeats , with the N and C termini located at the opposite ends of the rod ( Dong et al . , 2005 ; Sivaram et al . , 2006 ; Yamashita et al . , 2010 ) . However , we do not know how the subunits are organized within the complex and thus where the binding sites for the secretory vesicle and the plasma mem - brane are positioned in the exocyst . Here , we describe an approach to determine the 3D architec - ture of multi - protein complexes in vivo and apply it to the exo - cyst . Fluorescence microscopy techniques can measure small distances between subunits of protein complexes tagged with ﬂuorophores ( Aravamudhan et al . , 2014 ; Churchman et al . , 2005 , 2006 ; Clark et al . , 2013 ; Gordon et al . , 2004 ; Huang et al . , 2010 ; Joglekar et al . , 2009 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ; Saffarian and Kirchhausen , 2008 ; Szymborska et al . , 2013 ; Wan et al . , 2009 ; Yildiz et al . , 2003 ) . However , the distances between sub - units of a 3D complex are measured from projections onto 2D images , which complicates the interpretation of the measure - ments . In fact , the implementation of ﬂuorescence microscopy to determine the 3D architecture of protein complexes has not been generalized . We followed up on the PICT ( protein interac - tions from imaging complexes after translocation ) technique to engineer yeast cells with immobile anchoring platforms , where the protein complex is recruited in controlled orientation upon inducible translocation ( Gallego et al . , 2013 ) . We used one ﬂuo - rophore to tag the anchoring platform , which acts as a landmark and a different ﬂuorophore to tag , one at the time , the termini of each of the exocyst subunits . We analyzed live - cell images as in the SHREC method ( single molecule high - resolution colocaliza - tion ) to estimate the separation between the two ﬂuorophores with a precision below 5 nm ( Churchman et al . , 2005 ; 2006 ) . PICT allowed us to reproducibly measure the distances between these two ﬂuorophores for the different orientations with which the complex was recruited . We could thus use these distances as coordinates to position the termini of the subunits in the 3D space by trilateration . The high precision of our measurements allowed us to integrate the subunit positions with the structural information available for each subunit ( Russel et al . , 2012 ) to reconstruct the complete 3D molecular architecture of the exo - cyst in vivo . The architecture of the exocyst provides mecha - nistic insight into vesicle tethering and raises new questions such as the coordination of several copies of the exocyst during this process . RESULTS Positioning the Exocyst Subunits with Respect to a Reference Point We used ﬂuorescence microscopy to determine the location of the exocyst subunits within the complex . First , we engineered yeast to induce the anchoring of the exocyst to static plat - forms that we then used as a reference point . We designed the anchoring platforms based on the clathrin adaptor protein Sla2 . Sla2 molecules bind tightly to the plasma membrane , and their C - terminal part is exposed in the cytosol ( Picco et al . , 2015 ; Skruzny et al . , 2012 ) . When endocytosis is blocked by latrunculin A ( LatA ) , Sla2 forms stable and immobile domains on a ﬂat plasma membrane ( Kukulski et al . , 2012 ; Skruzny et al . , 2012 ) . To recruit the complexes , we used the rapamy - cin - induced heterodimerization of the FK506 - binding protein ( FKBP ) and the FKBP - rapamycin binding ( FRB ) domain ( Chen et al . , 1995 ; Gallego et al . , 2013 ) ( Figure 1A ) . About 40 – 50 Sla2 molecules are present at each endocytic site ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . We estimated that , on average , about as many exocyst complexes are recruited to the anchor sites . We generated 80 yeast strains expressing the anchor ( Sla2 fused to RFP and FKBP : Sla2 - RFP - FKBP ) and a speciﬁc combination of one exo - cyst subunit tagged with FRB ( bait - FRB ) and another subunit tagged with GFP at the N or C terminus ( prey - GFP ) ( Figure 1B ; Tables S1 and S2 ) . All fusion proteins were expressed from their endogenous loci . All the strains grew normally , except those expressing Sec8 N - terminally tagged with GFP or Sec5 - FRB , which were not included in this study . Since deletion of any of the exocyst subunits results in lethality or a severe growth defect ( Wiederkehr et al . , 2004 ) , this indicates that the tagged proteins were functional . Upon addition of both rapamycin and LatA , the bait - FRB was bound to the anchor ( Figure S1 ) , forcing the recruitment of the entire complex . We imaged yeast cells at their equatorial plane , where we could assume the observed anchoring platforms and the recruited complexes to be planar with the focal plane . Each anchoring platform formed a pair of ﬂuorescent spots resulting from the anchor RFP molecules ( red spot ) and prey - GFP molecules ( green spot ) present in the platform . We system - atically measured the separation between the centroids of the two spots in at least 60 anchoring platforms . The distance mea - surements follow a non - Gaussian distribution ( Churchman et al . , 2006 ) , which we used to estimate the true separation between the RFP and GFP ﬂuorophores with a precision of at least 5 nm ( see STAR Methods ; Figures 1 , 2 , and S2 ) . Each bait - FRB used to recruit the complex imposed a speciﬁc orientation , with respect to the anchoring platform , depending on its position within the complex ( Figure 1 and Figure S1A ) . This allowed us to image the complex recruited to the anchor with different orien - tations . For each orientation , we measured the distance from the anchoring platform of different subunit termini . We measured a total of 80 distances ( Figure 2 ) . Determining the 3D Architecture of the Exocyst We integrated the set of measured distances with the structural features of each subunit to determine the 3D architecture of the exocyst . We used the Integrative Modeling Platform ( IMP ) , a suite of programs that integrates structural constraints derived from diverse experiments to determine the structure of macro - molecular complexes ( Russel et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 3 and STAR Methods ) . We used the 80 distances as restraints to trilaterate in the 3D space the positions of the anchor RFP tag and of the GFP tags fused to the exocyst subunits ( Figures 3A and STAR Methods ) . We repeated the trilateration 10 , 000 times starting from ran - domized initial positions . Then , we collected the conﬁgurations of ﬂuorophore positions with the best IMP scores and that were compatible with our distance restraints . All of these ﬂuoro - phore positions clustered in two populations of solutions that are mirror images of each other ( Figure S3 ) . Therefore , one of the two mirror groups of solutions is likely to be representative of the po - sitions of the ﬂuorescent tags in the exocyst complex .

Cell 168 , 400 – 412 , January 26 , 2017 403 data does not allow to distinguish the chirality of the exocyst complex , we arbitrarily chose one of the two populations of ﬂuo - rophore positions for subsequent analysis . As atomic structures are not available for most of the exocyst subunits , we used ﬂexible strings of beads to represent each subunit . Each bead was 3 . 5 nm in diameter , the mean volume of a folded fragment of 120 residues in the PDB ( Shen et al . , 2005 ) . The size and the structural features of each subunit deﬁned the number of beads used to represent it ( Figure 3B and STAR Methods ) . We constrained consecutive beads in each string to be connected , and we imposed that two beads cannot occupy the same volume ( Figure 3C and STAR Methods ) . To reconstruct the architecture of the exocyst , we then used the ﬂuorophore positions to locate the N - and C - terminal beads of the exocyst subunits they were fused to ( Figure 3C and STAR Methods ) .

As an example , we highlight the posi - tions of Sec6 C - terminal tag ( Sec6 - GFP ) , Sec6 N - terminal tag ( GFP - Sec6 ) , and the anchor when Sec6 was used as bait ( Sec6 - FRB ) .

( C ) Restraints used to elucidate the exocyst ar - chitecture : Connected Beads ( i . e . , consecutive beads in a string can not be separated by more than a maximum distance ) , Excluded volume ( i . e . , two beads can not occupy the same volume ) , and Fluorophore - protein separation ( i . e . , N and C termini of exocyst subunits must fall within a maximum distance from the location of the ﬂuorophores they are ﬂagged with . This maximum distance is represented as transparent gray spheres ) . See also Table S3 . ( D ) IMP integrates all the data ( A , B , and C ) to reconstruct the architecture of the exocyst . Among all solutions that satisfy all of our restraints ( right , represented by a subset of 100 solutions randomlychosen ) , wechosethesolution withbest IMP score to illustrate the main features of the exocyst ( left ) . See also Figures S4 and S5 . Subunits are color - coded in blue ( Sec3 ) , orange ( Sec5 ) , yellow ( Sec6 ) , pink ( Sec8 ) , brown ( Sec10 ) , purple ( Sec15 ) , red ( Exo70 ) , and green ( Exo84 ) . Scale bars correspond to 10 nm . not tag , we used the known interaction between Sec8 and Sec6 ( Guo et al . , 1999 ; Sivaram et al . , 2006 ) as a constraint ( see STAR Methods and Table S3 ) . We sampled the space of solutions exhaus - tively by repeating the reconstruction of the exocyst 50 , 000 times , each time start - ing from a randomized initial position for each bead . We selected the 200 solutions that fulﬁlled all the restraints and had the best IMP score ( Figures 3D and 4 ) . The exocyst subunits showed a similar organization in all these solutions ( Figures 4A and S3C ) . Sec8 N terminus and the central part of Sec5 had the highest variability in their location due to the lack of strains with N - terminally GFP - tagged Sec8 or Sec5 - FRB . The central region of Sec3 also presented some variability , possibly due to its location near the less - resolved Sec5 and Sec8 . The different solutions could be clustered in six groups , which differ only slightly in the organization of Sec3 and Exo70 subunits ( Figure S4 ) . To verify the reliability of our method , we reconstructed the molecular architecture of the conserved oligomeric Golgi ( COG ) complex for seven of its eight subunits using the same approach that we used to determine the architecture of the exo - cyst . The molecular architecture of this multisubunit tethering 404 Cell 168 , 400 – 412 , January 26 , 2017 complex was recently determined by negative stain electron mi - croscopy ( EM ) ( Ha et al . , 2016 ) . Our 3D reconstruction of the COG complex shows that the spatial arrangement of the sub - units is equivalent to the published COG architecture : in both studies , the subunits share the same neighbors , and they are oriented with most of the N termini interlaced at the core of the complex , while the C termini protrude outward . Thus , the COG subunits organize in legs that extend from the core of the complex toward different directions ( Figure S5 and STAR Methods ) . We next investigated the capability of the computational reconstruction to detect inconsistencies in the dataset of measured distances for the exocyst subunits . We repeated the procedure with our distances randomly assigned to different bait and prey pairs or with a dataset of distances where one of the measurements had been shortened by 18 nm . In both cases , we could not ﬁnd any solution that satisﬁed all restraints . When we simulated less - pronounced inconsistencies in the da - taset ( i . e . , swapping two distance measurements between two different pairs of ﬂuorescent tags or shortening a single distance measurement between 6 and 16 nm ) , the trilateration of the ﬂuo - rophore positions gave solutions that did not converge in two mirror image solutions and were different from the solutions ob - tained using the real distances ( Figure S3 and STAR Methods ) . Overall , these results provide conﬁdence in our reconstruction of the exocyst and indicate that the approach is able to efﬁciently detect inconsistencies in the dataset of 80 distance measure - ments for the exocyst subunits . The Molecular Architecture of the Exocyst Complex In Vivo As a benchmark for the exocyst architecture , we used the Exo70 structure , the only subunit for which the almost complete struc - ture has been solved ( Dong et al . , 2005 ; Hamburger et al . , 2006 ) . In the cell , Exo70 shows a slightly bent conformation with its N and C termini located 11 . 3 ± 0 . 5 nm apart ( median ± SE , n = 200 ; see STAR Methods ) , which is consistent with the 11 . 8 nm of separation measured in the Exo70 crystal structure ( Dong et al . , 2005 ; Hamburger et al . , 2006 ) ( Figure 5A ) . Protein - protein interactions among exocyst subunits have been extensively studied in vitro ( Table S4 ) . If two subunits interact , they should appear nearby in the exocyst architecture . From the 200 solutions , we calculated the likelihood of the different subunits to be in close proximity ( Figure 5 and STAR Methods ) . Remarkably , 7 out of the 9 reported direct interactions occur between subunits that are in close proximity in our recon - struction ( Figure 5 ; Table S4 ) . Among these interactions , we did not consider those reported for Sec8 because they were used to position Sec8 within the complex . We then investigated the binding between subunits or fragments of them that are in close proximity in the exocyst architecture , but have not been shown to interact . Using yeast two - hybrid assays , we found that the Figure 4 .

However , we could not detect an interaction of Exo84 with Exo70 and Sec15 N terminus , which have been shown to interact in the hu - man exocyst and appear to be in close proximity in our model ( Matern et al . , 2001 ) . We also measured the overall volume for the exocyst to be 1 , 500 nm 3 ( STAR Methods ) , which is similar to the volume estimated from EM data ( (cid:1) 1 , 800 – 2 , 200 nm 3 ) ( Heider et al . , 2016 ) . In summary , the architecture of the exo - cyst complex that we determined in vivo recapitulates various published interaction and structural data not used for its determi - nation , providing conﬁdence in the overall accuracy of our results . Our reconstruction of the in vivo exocyst architecture showed that the exocyst subunits are rod shaped with their N and C termini located at opposite ends of the rod as previously hypothesized based on crystallographic and computational studies ( Croteau et al . , 2009 ; Hamburger et al . , 2006 ; Yama - shita et al . , 2010 ) . All of the subunits except Sec10 are attached to the core of the complex with their N - terminal parts , while their C - terminal ends project outward . Sec10 organization is in - verted ; its C - terminal part locates in the core , and its N - terminal end projects outward . The exocyst is organized in arms of different lengths , which gather in the central core and project in different directions ( Figure 4 and Movies S1 and S2 ) . The distal parts of the arms in the periphery of the complex might change their conformation without affecting the rest of the complex . Our reconstruction is consistent with the EM images of the puriﬁed complex and provides a structural basis to explain the ﬂexibility of the exocyst ( Heider et al . , 2016 ; Hsu et al . , 1998 ) . The Exo70 and Sec6 subunits form a V - shaped dimer , with their C - terminal parts interacting at the periphery of the complex . Exo70 and Sec6 N termini are separated but are embracing the core of the complex that links them together . Sec3 and Sec8 mirror the Exo70 and Sec6 organization , interacting with their C termini and interlacing their N termini in the core of the complex ( Figure 5A ) . Interestingly , Exo70 is structurally related to Sec3 C terminus , and Sec8 C terminus is structurally related to Sec6 C terminus ( see STAR Methods and Figure S6A ) . When mapped on the exocyst architecture , these fragments pre - sent a symmetric distribution in the complex ( Figure S6B ) . Exo84 and Sec5 subunits extend through the core of the complex and are adjacent to both Exo70 - Sec6 and Sec3 - Sec8 dimers ( Fig - ure 5 ) . Sec10 and Sec15 form a sub - complex that is less inter - laced with the rest of the complex . Located on top of the core , Sec10 - Sec15 subcomplex is proximal to only Exo70 , Sec6 , and Exo84 ( Figure 5 ) . The exocyst architecture provides mechanistic insight about the regulation of its assembly . Exo84 has been shown to be required for holding the Sec10 - Sec15 dimer together with the rest of the complex ( Heider et al . , 2016 ) . Exo84 is known to be targeted by different signaling pathways that regulate exocyst function and assembly ( Jin et al . , 2005 ; Luo et al . , 2013 ; Moskalenko et al . , 2003 ) . For instance , in mammals , Ral GTPases bind Exo84 to control exocyst function . The interaction of Ral GTPases governs exocyst function in a broad panel of cellular events such as cell migration ( Rosse´ et al . , 2006 ) , autophagy ( Bodemann et al . , 2011 ) , or postsyn - aptic membrane growth ( Teodoro et al . , 2013 ) . Despite the fact that Ral GTPases have not been described in yeast , the Ral GTPase binding domain of Exo84 is conserved and is located where Exo70 - Sec6 , Sec3 - Sec8 , and Sec10 - Sec15 di - mers meet at the core of the complex . This suggests that in mammals , Ral GTPases directly interact with the core of the complex to regulate exocyst assembly ( Figure 5A ) . During mitosis , Cdk1 phosphorylates Exo84 to inhibit the assembly of the exocyst ( Luo et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , the core of the complex may be a hub for the regulation of exocyst assembly and function . Exocyst Forms a Stable Complex The nature of the exocyst assembly in the cell is controversial . Sec3 and Exo70 have been proposed to bind the plasma mem - brane independently of the exocyst assembly ( Boyd et al . , 2004 ) . In this model , the full complex forms only when the vesicle arrives at exocytic sites carrying the other six subunits , including Sec5 . However , recent biochemical data suggested that the exocyst is a very stable complex ( Heider et al . , 2016 ) . In the exocyst , each subunit is adjacent to four other proteins on average , mostly in the central core of the complex , suggesting that the subunits are highly interlaced and strongly bound together . We studied the stability of the exocyst complex once it is recruited to the anchoring platforms using FRAP ( Gallego et al . , 2013 ) . We locally photobleached subunits recruited to an anchoring platform and followed the ﬂuorescence recovery over time . Using Exo70 - FRB as bait , 75 % of the exocyst showed no disassembly during 7 min , indicating that , at least under the recruitment conditions , the exocyst is a stable complex ( Figure 6A ) . We then used ﬂuo - rescence cross - correlation spectroscopy ( FCCS ) to quantify the fraction of Sec3 that is free in the cytosol and the fraction that is associated to Sec5 . Interestingly , the vast majority of Sec3 is in complex with Sec5 , with a dissociation constant ( K D ) of 2 . 59 nM ( Figure 6B ) , indicating that in the cytosol , the exocyst Figure 5 .

Cell 168 , 400 – 412 , January 26 , 2017 407 is strikingly stable , in agreement with biochemical data ( Heider et al . , 2016 ) . A Model for the Tethering of Secretory Vesicles The exocyst has not been puriﬁed bound to the secretory vesicle nor has this interaction been reconstituted in vitro . For instance , it is not clear how the exocyst can tether vesicles to the plasma membrane in a way that the complex does not interfere with their fusion . To gain insight into the tethering process , we determined thearchitectureoftheexocystassociatedtothesecretoryvesicle in living cells . We imaged Sec2 - GFP , a marker for the secretory vesicles , in six additional strains expressing different exocyst subunits as bait - FRB ( Figure S7A and Table S1 ) . Sec2 - GFP was efﬁciently recruited to the anchoring platform in all of the strains , indicating that the exocyst is also capable of binding to vesicles when it is anchored . We measured the distances between Sec2 - GFP and the anchoring platform in the six strains and inte - grated thedistances withthosethat we measuredfor the N and C terminioftheexocystsubunits ( Figure2B andTableS2 ) . Weused the same procedure to determine the architecture of the exocyst associated to a secretory vesicle . The architecture of the exocyst is identical to the architecture determined with the subunits only ( Figure 7A ) . Sec2 is 53 nm away from the exocyst , and Sec10 andSec15aretheclosestsubunitstoSec2 , whichisinagreement withtheabilityoftheSec10 - Sec15sub - complextoassociatewith the secretory vesicle ( Guo et al . , 1999 ; Roth et al . , 1998 ; Wieder - kehr et al . , 2004 ) ( Figure 7B ) . Interestingly , Sec10 and Sec15 are located roughly at the opposite side of the exocyst with respect to the N terminus of Sec3 and the C - terminal half of Exo70 , which are targeting the exocyst to the plasma membrane ( Boyd et al . , 2004 ; Dong et al . , 2005 ; Finger et al . , 1998 ; Yamashita et al . , 2010 ) ( Figure 4 ) . We generated a model for the tethering of secretory ves - icles where we approximated the secretory vesicle to a sphere of 50 nm of radius , the average radius of a secretory vesicle ( He et al . , 2007 ; Walworth and Novick , 1987 ) . The position deter - mined for Sec2 corresponds to the average location of all Sec2 - GFP molecules present on the vesicle . Assuming that Sec2 - GFP is on average evenly distributed on its surface , the position determined for Sec2 also deﬁnes the position of the vesicle cen - ter . We then oriented the exocyst to allow the N - terminal domain of Sec3 and the C - terminal domain of Exo70 to bind the plasma membrane ( Boyd et al . , 2004 ; Dong et al . , 2005 ; Guo et al . , 1999 ; Yamashita et al . , 2010 ) . Remarkably , the position of the secre - tory vesicle with respect to the exocyst suggests that the exo - cyst can bind the vesicle with Sec10 - Sec15 and the membrane with Sec3 and Exo70 simultaneously , while the two membranes are in direct contact . The exocyst is thus positioned at the side of A B Pre - bleach ( t = - 1 min ) Post - bleach ( t = 0 min ) Post - bleach ( t = 7 min ) Sec3 - GFP Sec3 Sec6 Sec8 Sec10 Sec15 Exo84 Sec5 Time ( min ) N o r m a li z ed I n t en s i t y 0 40 80 120 160 Sec3 Sec3 / Sec5 Sec5 C on c en t r a t i on ( n M ) 1 . 00 1 . 04 1 . 08 0 . 5 5 50 500 Sec3Sec5Cross N o r m a li z ed c o rr e l a t i on Lag time ( ms ) 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 0 4 8 Figure 6 .

Notably , the elongated shape of the Sec10 - Sec15 sub - complex keeps the vesicle away from the core of the complex . Sec6 extends its C - terminal part from the core toward the cavity left between the exocyst , the vesicle , and the plasma membrane . Since the Sec6 C - terminal part binds and activates the SNARE complex during vesicle tethering Figure 7 .

( B ) Schematic representation of the exocyst structure bound to the plasma membrane and a vesicle with a radius of 50 nm . The black cross indicates the average position of the GFP fused to Sec2 C terminus . See also Figure S7 . ( C ) Upto20copiesoftheexocystcouldparticipate simultaneously in vesicle tethering , forming a ring that surrounds the interface between the vesicle and the plasma membrane . ( Dubuke et al . , 2015 ) , the architecture of the exocyst suggests that the machinery in charge of fusing the vesicle with the plasma membrane is assembled in this cavity . Indeed , in our model , the cavity between the exocyst , the vesicle , and the plasma membrane is large enough to ﬁt a complex of the three exocytic SNAREs ( Figure S7B ) . The number of exocyst complexes involved in the tethering of a vesicle is not known . Each exocytic site at the plasma membrane consists of a single vesicle - tethering event at a time ( Donovan and Bretscher , 2015 ) . We measured an average of 13 ± 1 molecules of Sec5 , 17 ± 2 molecules of Sec6 , 15 ± 1 molecules of Sec10 , 16 ± 2 molecules of Sec15 , and 13 ± 1 molecules of Exo84 ( mean ± SE ; STAR Methods and Figure S1B ) at each exocytic site . We used our model to hy - pothesize how several exocyst complexes could cooperate during vesicle tethering . The exocyst is displaced from the inter - face between the vesicle and the plasma membrane . Therefore , manyexocystcom - plexes could bind both the vesicle and the plasma membrane simultaneously . A maximum of (cid:1) 20 complexes could be accommodated in a ring around the con - tact area between the two membranes ( Figure 7C ) . One side of this ring would thendockthevesicle , whiletheotherwould bind the plasma membrane , allowing the two membranes to establish a direct con - tact through the central hole of the ring ( Figure 7C ) . This ring orga - nization resembles the organization previously suggested for syn - aptotagmin during exocytic vesicle fusion ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) . DISCUSSION Understanding the complexity of the cellular machinery requires the development of hybrid approaches . Our approach combines Cell 168 , 400 – 412 , January 26 , 2017 409 cell engineering , quantitative ﬂuorescence microscopy , and computational integration of structural data to determine the ar - chitecture of protein complexes in living cells . The precision of our measurements is in the nm scale . Therefore , this approach is particularly suited for the study of large multisubunit assem - blies . A high number of combinations of baits and preys allows us to generate a large dataset of distances that synergis - tically constrain the space of possible architectures . In addition , this integrative approach could beneﬁt from the combination of data from EM , crystallography , or crosslinking coupled to mass spectrometry ( Erzberger et al . , 2014 ) to increase the preci - sion of the reconstruction . The method requires that the studied complex can be recruited to the anchoring platform in quantities that are large enough to be imaged . This might be a limitation , for instance , for nuclear assemblies or complexes that contain transmembrane proteins . Our approach tolerates , but cannot resolve , the conformational variability of the recruited complex during the imaging time . However , it allows the structural charac - terization of interactions between the target complex and other cellular components that cannot be puriﬁed together or reconsti - tuted in vitro . This information is fundamental to understanding the mode of action of the macromolecular assemblies in the cellular context . We used this approach to reconstruct the architecture of the exocyst complex directly in living cells . The exocyst is composed of rod - shaped subunits and has a conformation similar to an open hand . Each subunit contributes with one end of the rod to form the core of the complex at the palm of the open hand . The other ends of the rods are exposed at the periph - ery of the complex , where they form the ﬁngers of the hand , which may be ﬂexible . The ﬂexibility was observed in EM images of the puriﬁed exocyst ( Heider et al . , 2016 ; Hsu et al . , 1998 ) . Exo84 and Sec5 are mostly embracing the core of the complex , and they project little to the periphery of the complex , which would limit their ﬂexibility . Instead , the Sec10 - Sec15 sub - complex is situated on top of the core , which may allow them to undergo larger conformational changes . The symmetry we described between Exo70 - Sec6 and Sec3 - Sec8 supports the idea that the ancestral exocyst complex was composed of multiple copies of fewer proteins that duplicated and diverged ( Croteau et al . , 2009 ; Dacks et al . , 2008 ) . We showed that the exocyst subunits form an intricate mesh of interactions at the core of the complex . This explains why all the subunits are critical for exocyst function , although only half of them are directly involved in vesicle and membrane binding . The core of the complex hosts sites that are phosphorylated by Cdk1 during the cell cycle and a conserved domain that is targeted by Ral GTPases in mammals , suggesting that the core is the hub of pathways that regulate the complex as - sembly . The architecture of the exocyst provides a structural basis to tackle the mechanisms that regulate exocyst function in normal conditions but also under pathological conditions , such as cancer , where these regulatory mechanisms are affected . The organization of the subunits within the complex allows the exocyst to remain at the side of the interface between the vesicle and the plasma membrane without interfering in their subse - quent fusion . We hypothesize that in this manner , the exocyst can induce the assembly of the exocytic SNARE complex in the cavity between the exocyst , the vesicle , and the plasma membrane . The position of the exocyst next to the contact area between the vesicle and the plasma membrane suggests that several exocyst copies could cooperate during vesicle tethering . Indeed , we measured on average about 14 exocyst complexes at sites of vesicle fusion . Although we cannot say whether they are all actively tethering the vesicle , recent data shows that the resi - dence time at the exocytic site of the exocyst subunits is the same as the time a vesicle remains tethered ( Donovan and Bretscher , 2015 ) , suggesting that they must be somehow coor - dinated . Therefore , it is plausible that several exocyst copies form a ring around the interface between the vesicle and the plasma membrane with an organization similar to the one previously suggested for synaptotagmin ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) . The cooperation of several exocyst complexes is an exciting possible mechanism to ensure the ﬁdelity in recruiting the vesicle to the appropriate exocytic site on the plasma membrane .

Brieﬂy , GAL1pr - I - SceI cassette from pND32 was inserted between the SalI and the BglII sites to replace the eGFP cassette in pFA6a - EGFP - His3MX6 . The coding sequence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Exo84 ( aa . 1 - 753 ) ; Sec6 ( aa . 1 - 805 ) and Sec10 ( aa . 1 - 490 ) were PCR - ampliﬁed and cloned in frame with the Gal4 DNA - binding domain ( DBD ) into pB43 vector as Bait - Gal4 fusion . The coding sequence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sec3 ( aa . 601 - 1336 ) and Sec10 ( aa . 491 - 871 ) were PCR - ampliﬁed and cloned in frame with the Gal4 DBD into pB66 vector as Gal4 - Bait fusion . pB66 and pB43 derive from the original pAS2 DD vector ( Fromont - Racine et al . , 1997 ) . The empty pB66 and pB43 bait plasmids were used in the control assay . The coding sequence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sec15 ( aa . 382 - 910 ) and Sec8 ( aa . 474 - 1065 ) were cloned in frame with the Gal4 Acti - vation Domain ( AD ) into pP7 vector as AD - Prey fusion . The coding sequence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Exo70 ( aa . 1 - 623 ) and Sec15 ( aa . 1 - 381 ) were cloned in frame with the Gal4 Activation Domain ( AD ) into plasmid pP13 as Prey - AD fusion . The pP7 and pP13 prey plasmids , used in the control assay , are derived from the pP6 plasmid . pP6 derives from the original pGADGH vector ( Hartley , 1993 ) . The inserts of the yeast two - hybrid constructs were sequenced . Yeast strains for rapamycin - induced translocation were generated as described in Gallego et al . ( Gallego et al . , 2013 ) . Yeast genes were tagged or deleted at their genomic loci by PCR - based gene targeting ( Janke et al . , 2004 ) . We engineered yeasts cells expressing a C - terminal RFP - FKBP fusion of Sla2 in the strain BY4741 ( MKY2436 ) and in the strain MKY2128 ( MKY2129 ) . We use these strains to construct different combinations of bait - FRB and prey - GFP . Overall we generated 174 different strains , which are listed in the Table S1 . We followed different strategies according to the characteristics of the tag : We constructed C - terminal GFP fusions of the exocyst subunits , as well as Sec2 , with 3xmyeGFP in the parental strain MKY2128 ( MKY2548 to MKY2556 ) . The FRB - tagging of the eight subunits of the exocyst ( bait - FRB ) were performed in the parental strain MKY2436 ( MKY2437 to MKY2444 ) . We constructed C - terminal GFP fusions for all the COG subunits , except COG1 , with 3xmyeGFP in the parental strain BY4741 ( OGY0258 to OGY0264 ) . The FRB - tagging of the eight subunits of the COG ( bait - FRB ) were performed in the parental strain MKY2129 ( OGY0197 to OGY0204 ) . Finally , we used the SGA technology ( Tong and Boone , 2006 ) to mate the strains coding for the bait - FRB and prey - GFP for the exocyst subunits ( MKYSGA0009 to MKYSGA0061 ) and for the COG subunits ( OGYSGA4835 to OGYSGA4890 ) . For the N - terminal GFP fusions , we followed the Endonuclease - driven approach for seamless gene tagging by homologous recombination described in Khmelinskii et al . ( Khmelinskii et al . , 2011 ) . We introduced the GAL1pr - I - SceI cassette into the Leu2 - 3 locus of the BY4742 strain ( MKY2558 ) or the MKY2436 strain ( OGY0607 ) using the forward oligonucleotide mk1171 ( TCAAA AAGATCCATGTATAATCTTCATTATTACAGCCCTCTTGACTTATTTCAGGAAAGTTTCGGAGGAG ) and the reverse oligonucleotide mk1172 ( GTTTCGTCTACCCTATGAACATATTCCATTTTGTAATTTCGTGTCGATCGATGAATTCGAGCTCG ) . Positive colonies were selected on SD - HIS plates and conﬁrmed by colony - PCR . Using PCR - based gene targeting we tagged N - terminally Sec3 , Sec5 , Sec6 , Sec10 and Sec15 with sfGFP in the MKY2558 parental strain ( MKY2660 to MKY2662 , MKY2664 and MKY2665 ) and Cog2 , Cog3 , Cog4 , Cog5 , Cog6 and Cog7 in the OGY0607 parental strain ( OGY0646 to OGY0651 ) . For the exocyst subunits , strains car - rying the bait - FRB ( MKY2437 to MKY2444 ) were initially mated with MKY2557 strain using SGA technology ( MKYSGA0062 to MKYSGA0069 ) . The resulting strains were compatible with subsequent automated mating with the strains harboring prey - GFP ( MKY2660 to MKY2662 , MKY2664 and MKY2665 ) . For the COG subunits , we ﬁrst swapped the klURA cassette in strains expressing the bait - FRB ( OGY0197 to OGY0204 ) by the kanMX4 cassette ( OGY0637 to OGY0644 ) . The resulting strains were compatible with subsequent automated mating with the strains harboring prey - GFP ( OGY0646 to OGY0651 ) . Seamless marker excision was conﬁrmed by PCR after cells were sequentially grown in galactose media for 16h and SD plates containing 5 - FOA for two days , both for the exocyst subunits ( MKYSGA0070 to MKYSGA0098 ) and for the COG subunits ( OGYSGA6274 to OGYSGA6329 ) . We used PCR - based gene targeting ( Janke et al . , 2004 ) to successfully tag Exo70 and Exo84 N - terminally to sfGFP , which initially failed with the automated approach . First , the GAL1pr - I - SceI cassette was inserted into the Leu2 - 3 locus of the strains MKYSGA0062 to MKYSGA0069 ( MKY2895 to MKY2901 ) . Positive colonies were selected on SD - HIS plates and conﬁrmed by colony - PCR . Then , Exo70 and Exo84 sfGFP N - terminal tag was introduced via Endonuclease - driven approach for seamless gene tagging by homolo - gous recombination . Seamless marker excision was conﬁrmed by PCR after cells were sequentially grown in galactose media for 16h and SD plates containing 5 - FOA for two days ( MKY2923 to MKY2927 for Exo70 and MKY2933 , MKY2934 , MKY2968 , MKY2969 and MKY2971 for Exo84 ) . We were not able to generate yeast strains harboring Sec8 or Cog8 with an sfGFP N - terminal tag . Strains in which Sec5 - FRB was combined with N - or C - terminal prey - GFPs could not be generated . For C - terminal FRB - GFP fusions we tagged exocyst subunits in the parental strain MKY2128 ( MKY2540 to MKY2547 ) using PCR - based gene targeting ( Janke et al . , 2004 ) . Then we used SGA technology to cross these strains with MKY2436 and incorporate the anchor Sla2 - RFP - FKBP ( MKYSGA0001 and MKYSGA0003 to MKYSGA0008 ) . Of the 174 S . cerevisiae strains that we generated , we succeeded in measuring the separation between the RFP and GFP tag po - sitions for 168 strains ( i . e . , 82 strains where COG subunits were used as prey - GFP , 80 strains where exocyst subunits were used as prey - GFP and 6 more strains where Sec2 was tagged with GFP at the C terminus ) . These data are listed in the Table S2 . See Tables S1 and S5 for a complete list of the strains and plasmids used in this study . Cell 168 , 400 – 412 . e1 – e9 , January 26 , 2017 e3 Microscope setup We used an Olympus IX81 microscope equipped with 100x / 1 . 45 objective lens and Hamamatsu Orca - ER camera . Cells were excited with a X - Cite 120Q lamp ( Exelitas Technologies ) at 100 % intensity . Excitation light was reﬂected with an FF493 / 574 - di01 - 25x36 ( Semrock ) dual - edge dichroic beamsplitter . Emission light was ﬁltered with Semrock FF01 - 520 / 35 - 25 BrightLine and with Semrock FF01 - 624 / 40 - 25 BrightLine ﬁlters mounted on a ﬁlter wheel . All microscope hardware was controlled by Metamorph ( Universal Imaging ) . Imaging Exocyst complex recruitment was performed following the principle described for PICT method by Gallego et al . ( Gallego et al . , 2013 ) . Strains were grown in synthetic deﬁned ( SD ) medium with appropriate supplements at 25 (cid:3) C overnight and diluted and grown next morning up to exponential phase . Cells were attached to a 35 mm coverslip coated with Concanavalin A and were treated either with vehicle ( DMSO ) or 10 m M rapamycin ( Sigma ) . After 10 min incubation at room temperature , 200 m M LatA was added to depo - lymerize actin ﬁlaments . All images were acquired within an interval of time between 10 min and 20 min upon LatA addition ( 20 to 30 min rapamycin treatment ) . Images of the middle section of cells were acquired with 2 . 5 - 3 s of exposure time . The ﬁeld of view was imaged in the RFP and GFP channels and then it was moved to a different region of the sample , not affected by photobleaching . The preparation and imaging of each strain was duplicated ; for each sample we acquired (cid:1) 10 different ﬁelds of view . All acquisitions were done in duplicate for a total of (cid:1) 20 different ﬁelds of view . To assess the reproducibility of our approach , we repeated on different days the acquisition and the image analysis of a strain harboring Exo70 - FRB and Sec5 tagged at the C terminus ( MKYSGA0048 ) or at the N terminus ( MKYSGA0090 ) with GFP . No signif - icant difference was observed between the measurements ( Figure S2D ) . Image processing and distance measurements See Image processing and distance measurements in STAR Methods – Quantiﬁcation and statistical analysis . Exocyst structure determination The model of the exocyst architecture was determined with the Integrative Modeling Platform ( Russel et al . , 2012 ) . The measure - ments of the separation between ﬂuorophores in the 2D images implicitly contain the information to determine the relative position of the ﬂuorescent tags in the 3D space . First , we used the measured dataset of distances to trilaterate the relative position of each of the ﬂuorescent tags in the 3D space , where the position of each ﬂuorophore depends on the position of all the other ﬂuorophores . Second , we used the position of the ﬂuorescent tags to locate in the 3D space the subunits they were fused to . The interaction be - tween Sec6 and Sec8 was also used as an additional restraint ( Guo et al . , 1999 ; Sivaram et al . , 2006 ) . IMP is a suite of programs that integrates information from diverse experiments to determine the structure of macromolecular com - plexes . IMP assigns a score that quantiﬁes the fulﬁllment of the restraints ( Russel et al . , 2012 ) . Each step was divided into four stages : ( 1 ) Gathering of data , ( 2 ) Representation of tags or subunits and translation of the data into spatial restraints , ( 3 ) Optimization and sampling of the space of solutions , and ( 4 ) Analysis and assessment of the ensemble of models . Step I ) Localization of the tags We used the measured distances as restraints to determine the relative spatial location of the ﬂuorescent tags . 1 ) Gathering of data . Distance data ( Figure 2A and Table S2 ) were collected as detailed in STAR Methods—Image Processing and Distance Measurements . 2 ) Representation of the tags and translation of data into spatial restraints . Each ﬂuorescent tag ( RFP for the anchor , GFP N - terminal or GFP C - terminal for the exocyst subunits ) was represented by a bead ( Figure 3A ) . We encoded all measured distances between the RFP and each GFP as constraints in IMP ( Table S2 ) . 3 ) Optimization and sampling of the space of solutions . We used 500 steps of conjugate gradients optimization to determine the position of each of the ﬂuorescent tags , imposing the measured distances as a restraint ( Figure 3A and Figure S3 ) . To sample the space of solutions we repeated this procedure 10 , 000 times with IMP , starting each time from different random initial positions for all tags . 4 ) Analysis . The 200 solutions with the best IMP score fulﬁlling all restraints were selected and clustered , with Hierarchical Clus - tering and K - Means clustering , according to their similarity that was measured by their Root Mean Square Deviation ( RMSD ) using the Multiexperiment Viewer , MeV ( Saeed et al . , 2003 ) . All models converged into two clusters that are the mirror images of each other ( Figure S3 ) . As we could not assess the chirality of the exocyst complex , we randomly selected one of the two populations of tag positions for the subsequent step ( Figure 3A ) and referred to it as ‘‘ﬂuorophore positions . ’’ Step II ) Determination of the exocyst 3D architecture We then used the positions of the ﬂuorescent tags in the 3D space determined previously ( Step I ) as a scaffold to locate the exocyst subunits . The IMP procedure was similar : 1 ) Gathering of data . To gather structural information from each exocyst subunit we used IUPred ( Doszta´nyi et al . , 2005 ) for dis - order prediction , Psi - pred ( McGufﬁn et al . , 2000 ) for secondary structure prediction and HHSearch ( So¨ding , 2005 ) for comparative modeling template detection ( Figure 3B ) . e4 Cell 168 , 400 – 412 . e1 – e9 , January 26 , 2017 One of the solutions of the ﬂuorophore positions was randomly chosen as one of the restrains to locate the subunits . The SD of the positions of the tags in all the solutions computed for the ﬂuorophore positions was associated to each tag position , determined as follows : s = ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ s 2 x + s 2 y + s 2 z q ; where s x , s x and s z are the SDs of the positions of the tags computed along the axis x , y and z respectively . 2 ) Representation of subunits and translation of data into spatial restraints . Given the uncertainty of the modeling process , we focused on giving more importance to the distances gathered through the light microscopy and their variability than to the represen - tation of the subunits ( Schneidman - Duhovny et al . , 2014 ) . Given the lack of high - resolution structures for the exocyst subunits ( less than 26 % of the residues have their atomic structure determined experimentally ) , each subunit was represented by a ﬂexible string of connected beads . The representation is based on a PDB survey where the mean volume of a fragment of 120 residues is a sphere of 3 . 5 nm of diameter ( Shen et al . , 2005 ) . The numbers of beads were determined from the structural features of the proteins , including length , unstructured fragments , secondary structure , and tertiary structure ( see ‘‘Gathering of data’’ ; Figure 3B ) . We imposed consecutive beads to be connected . For this reason we used a maximum separation restraint between consecutive beads represent - ing each protein , which also varied depending on the structural features of each subunit ( see Table S3 ) . Excluded volume restraints were used for all the beads composing the proteins ( i . e . , two beads can not occupy the same volume being from the same or from different subunits ) ( Figure 3C ) . Posteriori validation of the representation is provided by the atomic structure of Exo70 that ﬁts nicely in its corresponding shape in our model ( Figure 5A ) . We empirically varied the size and number of the beads to ensure that our repre - sentation is not biasing the results , but the impact on the ﬁnal reconstruction was negligible ( data not shown ) . The ﬂuorophore positions determined in Step I ( ‘‘Localization of the tags’’ ) were used to locate the subunits of the complex . To locate the N termini of exocyst subunits we randomly chose one of the solutions among the ﬂuorophore positions ( see step I ‘‘Local - ization of the tags’’ ) . For each subunit , the bead representing the N terminus was constrained in a sphere centered on the position of the N - terminal GFP in this particular solution . The radius of the sphere was the 95 % conﬁdence interval computed from the distri - bution of the positions for the N - terminal GFP ( Figure 3C and Table S3 ) . Since Sec8 could not be tagged with GFP at the N terminus , the direct Sec6 - Sec8 protein - protein interaction ( Guo et al . , 1999 ; Sivaram et al . , 2006 ) was used as additional constraint to approx - imately locate the N terminus of the Sec8 subunit within the exocyst architecture . Exocyst subunits , when used as bait - FRB , were tagged at their C terminus with FRB to be recruited to the anchor . As a result of the recruitment , the RFP tag of the anchor also ﬂagged the C terminus of these subunits . Therefore , to locate the C terminus of exocyst subunits , we used both the position of the C - terminal GFP tag and the position of the RFP that ﬂagged the anchor . The bead repre - senting the C terminus of each subunit was thus constrained at the intersection between two spheres : a sphere centered on the position of the C - terminal GFP , and a sphere centered on the position of the anchor ( RFP ) . The radii for the spheres were half the separation between both GFP C terminus and RFP tags plus the 95 % conﬁdence interval computed from the distribution of the ﬂuo - rophore positions ( STAR Methods , Figure 3C , and Table S3 ) . Sec5 could not be tagged with FRB , therefore the Sec5 C terminus loca - tion was restrained only inside a sphere centered on Sec5 C - terminal GFP . The radius of the sphere was the 95 % conﬁdence interval computed from the distribution of the positions for the C - terminal GFP . All constraints used are summarized in the Table S3 . 3 ) Optimization and sampling of the space of solutions . 500 steps of conjugate gradients optimization were used to compute the location of each of the subunits , imposing the tag positions as a restraint ( Figure 3D ) . To sample the space of solutions exhaus - tively , we computed 50 , 000 independent optimizations starting from random initial positions for the beads representing the subunits . 4 ) Analysis . The 200 best scoring solutions that satisﬁed all the input restraints were selected and superimposed using Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) . To assess the variability in the bead location among the different solutions we measured the SD of the po - sitions as follows : s = ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ s 2 x + s 2 y + s 2 z q : Except for the N terminus of Sec8 , which we could not tag , all termini are similarly located in the different solutions ( Figure S3C ) . As expected , we detected variability only for the middle region of the proteins , in particular Sec3 and Sec5 . The SD of the localization of each bead is shown in Figure S3C . The population of models was hierarchically clustered , using the RMSD of Exo70 and then Sec3 . These subunits were chosen because they showed more than 1 conformation in the superposition of all the models . We obtained 6 sub - populations of models using K - means clustering ( Figure S4 ) . To illustrate the structure of the exocyst in the main ﬁgures we selected the model with the best IMP score , which is part of the largest cluster of Exo70 solutions . Controls As a ﬁrst control of the computational reconstruction , we repeated the procedure with the same dataset modiﬁed by randomly as - signing all measured distances to different FRB and GFP pairs . No solution that satisﬁed all the restraints could be isolated in this case . Cell 168 , 400 – 412 . e1 – e9 , January 26 , 2017 e5 As a second control , we repeated the procedure with a dataset where we swapped the distance between two tags that locate at distant sides of the complex ( Exo70 - FRB with Sec5 - GFP ) with the distance between two tags that locate close to each other ( Sec10 - FRB with GFP - Exo84 ) . In this case , we were able to identify solutions that satisﬁed all restraints , but they clustered in more than two clusters ( Figure S3D ) . This indicates that many conﬁgurations of ﬂuorophores positions are compatible with the data , and thus that the switching of only two distances leads to data that are not coherent . In addition , the solutions obtained are different from the loca - tion of the ﬂuorescent tags determined with the experimental distance measurements . The RMSDs between the models obtained from this simulated artifact and the experimentally reconstructed location of the ﬂuorophores were always above 15 nm . This is in the upper limit of RMSD between models belonging to different mirror images populations in the original models ( Figure S3E ) . To measure the robustness of our method , we repeated our procedure various times , shortening the distance measured for Sec3 tagged with GFP at the N terminus when Sec15 - FRB was used as bait ( 23 . 9 nm ) by 2 nm in each iteration . When the distance was reduced by values between 6 ( 25 % ) and 16 ( 67 % ) nm , the conﬁgurations of the ﬂuorescent tags were different from the ones derived with the experimentally measured distances . When the distance was reduced by 18 nm ( 75 % ) , we were not able to get any model that would fulﬁll the simulated set of restraints . Overall this indicates that the reconstruction of protein complexes is sensitive enough to respond to small variations in the measured distances ( i . e . , the resulting molecular architecture reﬂects this small differences in the measurements ) . However , when these variations come from an artifact in the measurements , either the reconstruction does not output any solution that can fulﬁll all the distance measurements ( i . e . , when the 80 distances were assigned randomly to different tags pairs or even when a single distance was shortened by more than 16 nm ) , or the solutions for the location of the ﬂuorescent tags do not converge , reﬂecting the lack of coherence among the dataset ( i . e . , after swapping two distances in a dataset of 80 distances or when the shortening of a distance is not more than 16 nm ) . COG complex structure determination We used the same procedure described for the exocyst to determine the molecular architecture of the Cog2 , Cog3 , Cog4 , Cog5 , Cog6 , Cog7 and Cog8 within the COG complex . Since we could not tag the N terminus of Cog8 , in addition of the 82 distance mea - surements ( Table S2 ) we also used the known interaction between the subunits Cog6 and Cog8 to locate the Cog8 N terminus ( Fotso et al . , 2005 ) . After repeating the trilateration for each ﬂuorescent tag 10 . 000 times , we selected the 200 models that had best IMP score and that fulﬁlled all 82 restraints . These models were clustered based on their RMSD in two populations that were mirror images of each other . One of these clusters was selected and used in the next step to determine the 3D architecture of these 7 subunits within the COG complex . The subunits were represented by strings of beads of 3 . 5 nm in diameter , taking into account the structural fea - tures of each COG subunit . To follow a procedure as close as possible to the one used for the exocyst , the radii of this spheres used to position the beads representing the N and C termini of the subunits were set to be the mean of the radii used to position the N and C termini of the exocyst subunits . Similarly to the exocyst , the bead representing the C terminus of each COG subunit was thus con - strained on the intersection between two spheres : a sphere centered on the position of the C - terminal GFP , and a sphere centered on the position of the anchor ( RFP ) . We also imposed an excluded volume restraint , a maximum distance between consecutive beads of the same subunit . All the restraints are listed in Table S3 . We computed the reconstruction of the molecular architecture of the 7 COG subunits 50 , 000 times as for the exocyst . We selected the solution with best IMP score as the representative reconstruction of the 7 subunits of the COG complex ( Figure S5 ) . Structurally related fragments , comparative modeling and volume The HHpred interactive server for protein homology detection and structure prediction ( So¨ding et al . , 2005 ) was used to identify struc - turally related fragments . The structure of the residues 60 to 623 of Exo70 has been determined ( PDB entry 2b1e _ A ) . Sec3 residues 741 to 1332 were predicted to be similar to this atomic structure with a p value of 2 . 3E - 04 . Likewise , the atomic structure for the C - ter - minal part of Sec6 has been determined ( from residues 407 to 805 ; PDB entry 2fji _ 1 ) and the same structure is predicted to represent residues 590 to 997 of Sec8 with a p value of 2 . 3E - 06 . Thus , the pair Exo70 - Sec6 is structurally related to the pair Sec3 - Sec8 , at least in fragments of the proteins . Similarly , the three - dimensional structure of residues 432 to 650 of Sec9 , 28 to 264 of Sso1 and 22 to 111 of Snc2 were modeled based on their homology to known structures ( PDB entry 3j96 _ M , PDB entry 4jeh _ B and PDB entry 3hd7 _ A with p values of 2 . 5E - 37 , 7 . 8E - 44 and 5 . 4E - 35 respectively ) . Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) was used to generate a density map of the exocyst architecture solution with best IMP score and to measure its volume . Calculation of Sec2 position To locate the position of the C terminus of Sec2 in respect to the exocyst complex , we measured the distance between the recruited Sec2 , fused to GFP at the C terminus ( prey - GFP ) , and the Sla2 - RFP - FKBP for different bait - FRB ( Figure 2B and Table S2 ) . These distances were added as restraints in IMP together with the distances used to compute the ﬂuorophores positions . Using the exact same approach described previously we could thus resolve the average localization of Sec2 - GFP . We iterated the optimization 50 , 000 times starting with different initial positions for the beads of the subunits and using one of the solutions of the ﬂuorophore positions randomly chosen . The ﬂuorophore positions also included the Sec2 - GFP ﬂuorescent tag position . We selected the 200 e6 Cell 168 , 400 – 412 . e1 – e9 , January 26 , 2017 best solutions that fulﬁlled all the restraints . All of the selected solutions showed the same spatial localization for the C terminus of Sec2 while the position of the exocyst subunits remained unaltered . For simplicity , Sec2 was represented as a single bead marking the average position of its C terminus . Quantiﬁcation of exocyst subunit abundances , sample preparation GFP - Sec5 , GFP - Sec6 , GFP - Sec10 , GFP - Sec15 , GFP - Exo84 and Nuf2 - GFP cells were tagged with the same sfGFP . Cells were grown overnight on SC - Trp at 25 (cid:3) C till OD 600 = 0 . 6 . Sec5 , Sec6 , Sec10 , Sec15 or Sec10 cells were mixed together with Nuf2 cells , of the same mating type , with a 1 : 1 ratio and adhered on a glass coverslip coated with Concanavalin A , with a 10 min incubation at room temperature . Cells were imaged with an Olympus IX81 , equipped with a 100x / 1 . 45 NA objective , a FF493 / 574 - di01 - 25x36 Brightline dual band dichroic ( Semrock ) , an FF01 - 520 / 35 Brightline emission ﬁlter and a Hamamatsu Orca - ER CCD camera . Cells were excited with a X - Cite 120Q lamp ( Exelitas Technologies ) at 100 % of power for 500 ms and imaged with a z stack of 21 frames separated by 200 nm ( Figure S1B ) . FRAP The FRAP experiments were done on a custom - built set - up that focuses a 488 nm laser beam in a 0 . 5 m m spot on the sample plane . The exocyst complex was recruited to the anchoring platform using Exo70 - FRB as bait in cells treated with 10 m M rapamycin . After 10 min incubation at room temperature , 200 m M LatA was added to depolymerize actin ﬁlaments . The FRAP experiment were done within an interval of time between 10 min and 20 min upon LatA addition . Images were recorded every 12 s , and exposure time ranged from 900 to 1200 ms , depending on the prey - GFP that was imaged . Before bleaching , we imaged ﬁve frames to estimate the initial ﬂuorescence . After bleaching , we followed the ﬂuorescence recovery for 39 frames . Images were background subtracted and all movies were corrected for photobleaching using ImageJ software ( https : / / imagej . nih . gov / ij / ) . The ﬂuorescence recovery was calcu - lated within a circle of 4 pixels centered on the anchoring platform that was bleached . The average recovery curve was calculated from at least 4 independent experiments aligned to the bleaching time . FCCS Fluorescence cross - correlation spectroscopy data were recorded on a Leica SP2 confocal microscope equipped with single - photon counting avalanche photodiodes and a 63x water objective . GFP was excited using a 488 nm argon laser , mCherry was excited by a 561 diode laser . The emitted light was separated by a dichroic mirror ( LP560 ) and then passed into two different detection channels using the ﬁlters BP500 - 550 ( GFP ) and HQ638DF75 ( mCherry ) . Auto - and crosscorrelation curves , the number of particles in the respective strains , and the K D of the interaction were calculated as described previously ( Boeke et al . , 2014 ; Maeder et al . , 2007 ) . Yeast two - hybrid Yeast two - hybrid was performed by Hybrigenics , S . A . , Paris , France ( https : / / www . hybrigenics - services . com ) . Bait and prey con - structs were transformed in the yeast haploid cells L40deltaGAL4 ( MATa ) and YHGX13 ( Y187 ade2 - 101 : : loxP - kanMX - loxP , MAT a ) , respectively . The diploid yeast cells were obtained by mating . These assays are based on the HIS3 reporter gene ( growth assay without histidine ) . Due to the auto - activation properties of Sec3 C terminus ( aa 601 - 1336 ) we could not assess its interaction with Sec8 C terminus ( aa . 474 - 1065 ) . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Image processing and distance measurements Images were background subtracted and corrected for the uneven cytoplasmic signal by subtracting from the image the median ﬁltered version of the image itself computed with a kernel of 10 pixels . We processed the images to determine the distance between the centroid positions of the RFP tagged to the anchor and of the GFP tagged to exocyst subunits ( Figures 2 and Figure S2 ) . For each of the 80 strains we repeated the measurements in 60 to 290 anchoring platforms , distributed in different cells . We only considered RFP and GFP spot pairs resulting from the recruitment of the exocyst to anchoring platforms induced by rapamycin . We discarded regions where individual spot pairs could not be optimally resolved such as the cell neck or cells where the focal plane did not image the middle section of the cell . The image processing was done as follows : 1 . Spot detection : Only pairs of spots visible on both the red channel ( named W1 ) and the green channel ( named W2 ) were selected . Spots were detected using Particle Tracker plugin in ImageJ ( Sbalzarini and Koumoutsakos , 2005 ) , which tracks the centroid position of each spot pair in the two channels : one centroid for W1 and one centroid for W2 . 2 . Chromatic aberration correction : Centroid positions were corrected for chromatic aberration using a warping transformation which was computed from images of Tetraspeck beads emitting in both the RFP and GFP channels . The beads’ centroids were tracked with ParticleTracker in ImageJ and the warping transformation was computed using a custom written software in MATLAB ( Image Processing toolbox ; Mathworks ) . 3 . Spot selection : For each spot , we computed the second momentum of brightness and eccentricity . The second momentum of brightness was computed as described by Sbalzarini and Koumoutsakos ( Sbalzarini and Koumoutsakos , 2005 ) . The eccentricity e of a spot S was computed as Cell 168 , 400 – 412 . e1 – e9 , January 26 , 2017 e7 e = m 20 + m 02 + ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ð m 20 (cid:4) m 02 Þ 2 + 4 m 211 q m 20 + m 02 (cid:4) ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ð m 20 (cid:4) m 02 Þ 2 q + 4 m 211 where m ij = X x ˛ S X y ˛ S x i y j I ð x ; y Þ : I ð x ; y Þ is the ﬂuorescence intensity for the pixel in position x and y . We assumed that the spot pairs in focus , whose spots colocal - ized because of the FRB - FKBP heterodimerization , were the most abundant spots in the cell , and that all these spots shared similar properties in terms of brightness and shape . Therefore , a selection of the spots was performed by identifying the spots that cluster in a 2D space identiﬁed by the second momentum of brightness and the eccentricity . The cluster was determined using a 2D binned kernel density estimate ( bkde2d function in R , CRAN ) . We estimated the 2D density distribution that the spot properties obeyed and then we selected those spots that presented a probability of 50 % or higher to be found . The bandwidth of the kernel estimate was determined using dpik ( Sheather and Jones , 1991 ) . The spots selected for the distance estimate were those that matched the selec - tion criteria in both channels ( spots marked in red in Figure S2A , ‘‘Selection of the spot pairs which are in focus’’ ) . 4 . Quality of Gaussian interpolation : The centroid positions of the selected spots were computed using the center of brightness as in Sbalzarini et al . ( Sbalzarini and Koumoutsakos , 2005 ) . The selected spots were then interpolated with a Gaussian function . The quality of the interpolation was assessed by the coefﬁcients of determination R 2 RFP and R 2 GFP for the red and green channel of each spot pair respectively . We imposed a reﬁnement of the spot selection choosing only those spots that clustered in the space deﬁned by R 2 RFP and R 2 GFP ( Figure S2A , ‘‘Reﬁnement of the spot selection using the goodness of the Gaussian ﬁt’’ ) . 5 . Angle selection : Spot pairs colocalizing as a result of the FRB - FKBP heterodimerization should on average be organized with the green spot located farther away from the neighboring plasma membrane than the red spot . To increase the likelihood of selecting only those pairs , and not detecting RFP and GFP spot pairs which might be independent endocytic and exocytic sites occurring in close proximity on the plasma membrane , we measured the angle between the centroids of the ﬂuorescent spots and the tangent to the closest point on the plasma membrane . We then chose spots whose angle difference was negligible ( < 0 . 05 p ) . To measure the angle we chose the point on the plasma membrane closest to the centroid of the RFP spot ; we then measured the angle between the tangent to the plasma membrane passing through this point and the vectors linking this point to each spot centroid . An efﬁcient recruitment of the prey - GFP to the Sla2 - RFP - FKBP anchoring platform had a similar angle between the centroids of the spots and the tangent to their neighbor membrane ( Figure S2A , ‘‘Reﬁnement of the spot selection choosing centroid pairs that have the same angle to the plasma membrane’’ and the cartoon there ) . 6 . Outlier detection : To exclude the remaining incorrect values among the measured distances we assumed that , given a set of N distance measurements X = f x i g i = 1 . N , the majority of distances are true measurements . Those measurements follow a known non - Gaussian distribution ( Churchman et al . , 2006 ) p ð x ; m ; s Þ = (cid:3) x s 2 (cid:4) exp (cid:5) - - m 2 + x 2 2 s 2 (cid:6) I 0 (cid:3) x m s 2 (cid:4) ; x ˛ X : m is the true distance separating the ﬂuorophores , which we want to estimate , and s is the variance of the distribution . I 0 is the modiﬁed Bessel function of integer order 0 . m and s were determined maximizing the likelihood that we obtained the dataset X : L ð m ; s Þ = Y x ˛ X p ð x ; m ; s Þ : We deﬁned an outlier as a contamination in the measurements that is unlikely in respect to the distribution p . If the dataset X has one outlier , this contributes to the likelihood with a low probability , which reduce the overall likelihood value . We thus rejected each measurement x i , one at the time , and we measured the resulting likelihood for the set of measurements without x i ~ L ð m ; s Þ = Y x ˛ X nf x i g p ð x ; m ; s Þ : m and s are the values estimated by maximizing L ð m ; s Þ . A candidate outlier x out is deﬁned as the measurement whose removal gives the highest value for ~ L ð m ; s Þ : Y x ˛ X nf x out g p ð x ; m ; s Þ > Y x ˛ X nf x i g p ð x ; m ; s Þ ; c x i ˛ X nf x out g : We rejected x out and iterated the process computing again a new estimate for m and s based on the new set of measurement , without the selected outlier . We then searched for the next outlier in the same way : removing each of the remaining measurement one at the time and computing the likelihood ~ L given the new estimated values of m and s . To stop the outlier rejection we observed that the removal of an evident outlier changed the estimate of m and s more than the removal of an outlier that did not deviate much from the predicted distribution . In other words , the Maximum Likelihood Estimate e8 Cell 168 , 400 – 412 . e1 – e9 , January 26 , 2017 is very sensitive to strong outliers , which will be the ﬁrst to be identiﬁed . Thus , the more we proceeded with the removal of outliers the smaller the difference between the old and new estimate of m and s , with and without the last outlier removed , would become . Let us label each of the iterations with an integer index l . Two subsequent outlier rejections will give two values of the distance : m l and m l + 1 . Their difference Dm l = m l (cid:4) m l + 1 will decrease for increasing values of l . We thus deﬁned a score p m l = 1 = Dm l P j 1 . Dm j ; which is higher when the outlier rejection approximate a dataset of distances well described by p ð x ; m ; s Þ . Similarly for s we could deﬁne the score p s l = 1 = Ds l P j 1 . Ds j : We then deﬁne a scoring function as S (cid:7) p m l ; p s l (cid:8) = p m l log p m l + p s l log p s l : The selected dataset , candidate to be the closest to the ‘‘true dataset’’ without outliers , was the one that maximized the scoring function ( Figure S2B – Quantiﬁcation of the distances between pairs of spots ) : max l (cid:7) S (cid:7) p m l ; p s l (cid:8)(cid:8) : In the Table S2 under ‘‘Number of measurements’’ we list the number of spot pairs used to estimate the m ( Estimated distance ) and the s ( Sigma ) in each selected dataset . All error bars in Figure 2 and the Estimated Standard Errors for m and s in Table S2 are the Standard Errors estimated from the inverse of the observed Fisher information computed at the maximum of the likelihood . Outlier rejection and distance estimation To assess the accuracy of the outlier rejection we generated in silico data from distributions with known true distance and sigma ( Churchman et al . , 2006 ) . We then contaminated the data with outliers mimicking the range of outliers we encountered experimentally and we run our analysis procedure . We could successfully reject the outliers and get a very accurate estimate of the true distance ( Figure S2C ) . Estimate of the likelihood of subunits being in close proximity The exocyst subunits are represented as string of beads . We measured the separation among all bead pairs between different sub - units for each of the 200 solutions . For each of the bead pairs we could thus estimate the distribution of all the separations measured in the 200 solutions . We used this distribution to estimate the likelihood that the two beads belonging to different subunits are located closer than 4 nm and we used the likelihood as a score to highlight bead pairs that are likely to be adjacent ( Figure 5B ) . Quantiﬁcation of exocyst subunit abundances , image analysis Images were analyzed with a custom software written in Python 2 . 7 that measured the ﬂuorescence intensity of the ﬂuorescent spots in the images corrected for local background ( Joglekar et al . , 2006 ) . The number of Nuf2 molecules used to calibrate the ﬂuorescence intensity was 280 . 6 ± 16 . 8 molecules each ﬂuorescence spot ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) .

Recruitment of Exocyst Subunits to the Anchoring Platform , Related to Figure 1 ( A ) Exocyst subunits were tagged to FRB and GFP at the C terminus ( bait - FRB - GFP ) in a strain carrying the Sla2 - RFP - FKBP as anchor . Upon addition of ra - pamycin and LatA , cells were imaged for the anchor - RFP - FKBP ( left column ) and the bait - FRB - GFP ( middle column ) .

Scale bars are 2 m m long . Figure S2 . Image Analysis and Distance Estimate , Related to Figure 1 ( A ) The three steps of the image analysis pipeline : Selection of the spot pairs which are in focus : The eccentricity and the second momentum of brightness of the spot pairs were used to select the diffraction limited spots that were nicely in focus and well isolated .

Scale bars are 2 m m long . The spots taken as examples have been magniﬁed 5 times . ( B ) The estimate of the distances : The selected distances are shown in the gray histogram . If outliers are present they are iteratively rejected ; for each outlier rejected , we compute a new estimate of the separation between the ﬂuorophores and we associate it to a score . The scores are shown in the dot plot . The spot circledinredmarksthedatasetwhoseoutlierrejectionscoredthebestandwhichistakenasthedatasetwithoutoutliers ( seeSTARMethods – ImageProcessing and Distance Measurements section ) . This is the dataset shown in the red histogram . The true distance between the ﬂuorophores was derived by Maximum Likelihood Estimate using the probability distribution that the distances obey ( Churchman et al . , 2006 ) . ( C ) The accuracy of the distance estimation and outlier rejection . We generated in silico datasets of distance measurements for the range of distance values that we measured experimentally and we contaminated these datasets with outliers mimicking those that we encountered experimentally . We then used these datasets to perform our outlier rejection and estimate the true distances , which were always an accurate estimate of the true distances used to generate the datasets . ( D ) Assessment of the reproducibility of our approach . We repeated the sample preparation , sample imaging , data collection , and data analysis for strains expressing Sec5 - GFP _ C and Exo70 - FRB ( upper bar plot ) or Sec5 - GFP _ N and Exo70 - FRB ( lower bar plot ) . Acquisitions were performed on different days . Error bars show the SE . Figure S3 .

Modelsbelongingtoownclusterhavevaluesbetween0and75A˚andmodelsbelonging to the mirror image cluster vary between 130 and 155 A˚ . All models from ( D ) have values above 155 A˚ , indicating that they are not similar to the original con - ﬁgurations of ﬂuorophores used for the exocyst modeling . Figure S4 . Clustering of All Solutions Obtained for the Computed Exocyst 3D Architecture , Related to Figure 4 The 200 solutions obtained for the exocyst 3D architecture clustered by RMSD ( see STAR Methods ) . Models belonging to each cluster are superposed and shown from different perspectives . The number associated to each branch of the tree ( top ) indicates the number of models in each cluster . Exocyst subunits are color coded as indicated . Figure S5 . The 3D Architecture of the COG Complex , Related to Figure 3 Different views of the COG complex reconstruction with best IMP score are used to illustrate the 3D architecture of the COG complex . COG subunits are represented with beads . The volume of each bead is approximately equivalent to 120 amino acids folded in a helix - bundle . Figure S6 . Partial Symmetry in the Exocyst Complex , Related to Figure 4 ( A ) Bead representation of the Exo70 , Sec3 , Sec6 and Sec8 subunits are color coded .
