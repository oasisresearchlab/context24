Despite its prevalence and significance in informational dissemination and emotional connection , there lacks a comprehensive understanding of visual crisis commu - nication in the aftermath of a pandemic which is characterized by uncertain local situations and emotional fatigue . To fill this gap , this work collected 345 , 423 crisis - related posts and 65 , 376 original images during the Xi’an COVID - 19 local outbreak in China , and adopted a mixed - methods approach to understanding themes , goals , and strategies of crisis imagery . Image clustering captured the diversity of visual themes during the outbreak , such as text images embedding authoritative guidelines and “visual diaries” recording and sharing the quarantine life . Through text classification of the post that visuals were situated in , we found that different visual themes highly correlated with the informational and emotional goals of the post text , such as adopting text images to convey the latest policies and sharing food images to express anxiety . We further unpacked nuanced strategies of crisis image use through inductive coding , such as signifying authority and triggering empathy . We discuss the opportunities and challenges of crisis imagery and provide design implications to facilitate effective visual crisis communication .

Characterized by de - centralized communication and crowdsourced information creation , social media affords a prominent place where people gather to cultivate situational awareness [ 21 , 56 , 58 ] , route help - seeking requests [ 40 , Authors’ addresses : Changyang He , Department of Computer Science and Engineering , Hong Kong University of Science and Technology , Hong Kong SAR , China , cheai @ cse . ust . hk ; Lu He , Zilber College of Public Health , University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee , Milwaukee , USA , he32 @ uwm . edu ; Wenjie Yang , Department of Computer Science and Engineering , Hong Kong University of Science and Technology , Hong Kong SAR , China , wyangbc @ connect . ust . hk ; Bo Li , Department of Computer Science and Engineering , Hong Kong University of Science and Technology , Hong Kong SAR , China , bli @ cse . ust . hk .

H C ] 18 N ov 2023 01 : 2 Changyang He et al . 110 , 133 ] and provide mutual emotional support [ 41 , 47 , 135 ] . As the development of camera - embedded smartphones and high - speed internet eases the creation and sharing of images online , social media imagery is an increasingly substantial component in crisis communication . Mil - lions of images are generated across different disasters [ 4 ] and transmit informative crisis - related messages [ 105 ] . Among different modalities in crisis communication , imagery has manifested a unique capability in delivering certain kinds of knowledge , sentiments , and experiences during crises [ 8 , 9 , 62 , 86 , 102 , 107 , 141 ] . For example , crisis images in COVID - 19 , whether formal visualizations [ 141 ] or non - formal memes [ 86 ] , could effectively engage viewers with crisis information such as disease prevalence , and facilitate public decision making . Through specific visual elements , crisis imagery can also have an emotional impact on the audience [ 53 , 86 ] , with the power of emotional persua - sion [ 53 ] or emotional connection establishment [ 9 , 87 ] . A visual representation is also helpful for reaching and engaging the audience with relatively low literacy levels [ 39 ] and could facilitate their sensemaking under crises . Nonetheless , the majority of work in crisis communication has exclu - sively focused on textual content for analysis . The understanding of visual crisis communication through social media imagery , and the interplay between crisis text and images , are still limited . The informational and emotional richness of crisis imagery has great potential in supporting crisis response during local outbreaks in the aftermath of the pandemic which are local situation - centered and emotionally fatigued [ 2 , 14 , 128 ] . In the aftermath of the pandemic , local outbreaks are common [ 79 , 123 ] , unpredictable , and affect local policies and residents’ daily life [ 14 ] , which poses new challenges for crisis response . People not only need to cultivate situational awareness of the rapidly shifting local policies [ 2 , 129 ] , but also have to retract to more constrained everyday behav - iors and potentially suffer from crisis fatigue [ 128 ] . Further , local outbreaks are characterized by the information barrier , with segregated perceptions of crises between the affected local populations and the general public [ 115 ] , which demands persuasive crisis communication to get attention from the outside world . Given the unique value of social media crisis imagery in information persuasion and emotional contagion , understanding the use of crisis imagery may shed light on how people utilize visual narratives to cope with these specific challenges of crisis communication in local outbreaks . In particular , unpacking which visual themes are presented in local outbreaks , and how people strategically adopt them to share situational information and vent emotions beyond textual narratives , may provide insight into efficient and effective multimodal crisis communication in the aftermath of the pandemic . To fill this significant research gap , we propose the following research questions : • RQ1 : What themes of images do users share on social media during a COVID - 19 local outbreak ? ( Crisis Visual Themes ) • RQ2 : For what crisis communication goals do users share crisis images during the local outbreak ? ( Crisis Visual Goals ) • RQ3 : How does the use of crisis images strategically facilitate crisis communication during the local outbreak ? ( Crisis Visual Strategies ) To answer the research questions , we adopted mixed - methods and multimodal analysis , incorpo - rating image clustering , text classification , and inductive coding , to uncover themes , goals , and strategies of crisis imagery . We focused on the event of COVID - 19 outbreak in Xi’an City in China , and collected 345 , 423 crisis - related posts and 65 , 376 original images from Weibo , a popular Chinese social media platform . We first used image clustering to distinguish diverse crisis visual themes such as text images and posters . By identifying information and emotions of crisis - related posts with images , we then revealed how the use of different visual themes significantly correlated with the informational and emotional goals in text , such as the proliferation of text images in disseminating Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 8 , No . CSCW2 , Article 01 . Publication date : January 2024 . Images Connect Us Together 01 : 3 the latest policies and the association between food image and anxiety in lockdown . Through the inductive coding of image - attached posts , we further identified four types of strategic use of crisis images to facilitate crisis communication , including images as signs of authority , visual - based information enhancement , evidence to improve credibility , and triggers for empathy . We discuss opportunities ( e . g . , establishing emotional connections ) and challenges ( e . g . , image - enhanced mis - information ) of image - based crisis communication , reflect on the complementary roles of crisis images and language , and propose design implications to promote effective and accurate crisis communication through social media crisis images . In summary , the contribution of this work to crisis communication literature in HCI and CSCW includes : ( 1 ) we propose an effective analytical structure to identify diverse crisis image themes , and capture a comprehensive taxonomy of visual representations in a COVID - 19 local outbreak ; ( 2 ) we uncover inter - modality correlations between text and images , demonstrating that crisis images of different types serve different informational and emotional goals ; ( 3 ) we unveil nuanced and unique strategic use of social media crisis images to supplement or augment textual narratives , enhancing crisis communication as a whole ; and ( 4 ) we provide design implications to facilitate accurate , efficient and effective visual crisis communication . This work sheds light on opportunities and challenges of visual - based crisis communication , and highlights the significance of understanding multimodal crisis communication as an organic whole . 2 RELATED WORK 2 . 1 Crisis Communication on Social Media and Challenges in Local Outbreaks Crisis communication has been a crucial research topic that aims to understand and facilitate the communication of preparing for , responding to , and recovering from crises [ 18 ] . Traditional crisis communication on mass media largely highlights a one - way and top - down approach from authoritative agencies to the general public [ 117 , 138 ] . The rapid development of social media has enabled two - way communication between the public and official agencies which emphasizes public participation and engagement in crisis response [ 29 , 40 , 141 ] . How users create , seek , and transmit crisis - related information on social media has attracted increasing research attention in the HCI and CSCW communities ( e . g . , [ 61 , 80 , 91 , 110 , 118 ] ) . The two - way crisis communication on social media brings opportunities for crowdsourced information creation and dissemination [ 41 , 136 ] . Based on that , nuanced crisis communication patterns have been discovered and investigated by HCI and CSCW researchers . One line of work looks at how people cultivate situational awareness of a crisis through collective sensemaking [ 21 , 56 – 58 , 108 ] . Under health crises like Zika and COVID - 19 that are characterized by uncertainty , such a collective sensemaking process is substantial for risk assessment and decision making [ 38 ] . Another strand of work focuses on self - organized collaboration in response to help - seeking requests when crises happen [ 40 , 59 , 110 , 111 , 133 , 142 ] . Online community members especially digital volunteers develop a set of strategies such as using specific hashtags [ 78 , 134 ] and structuring posts with a specialized syntax [ 40 , 110 , 133 ] to facilitate the timely routing of help - seeking posts to the intended target ( s ) . Owing to misinformation and conspiracy theories often becoming widely spread during crises [ 31 , 109 ] , researchers have also investigated the debunking efforts and procedures to cope [ 43 , 132 ] . Local outbreaks in the aftermath of a pandemic , as a special type of public health crisis , pose unique challenges to citizens’ crisis response . During local outbreaks , affected populations have to figure out and adapt to unpredictable local policies that influence their daily life [ 2 , 14 ] . Also , local residents have to retract to constrain everyday behaviors , and may potentially suffer from fatigue with decreased motivation to comply with regulations [ 128 ] . Moreover , in such local outbreaks , Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 8 , No . CSCW2 , Article 01 . Publication date : January 2024 . 01 : 4 Changyang He et al . there are segregated perceptions of crises between the affected local populations and the general public , which demands persuasive crisis communication to cross the information barrier [ 115 ] . On this note , multimodal crisis communication combining text and visual use may hold special value in transmitting situational information and building emotional connections . Nonetheless , little work has looked at multimodal crisis communication during local outbreaks with a holistic view of text and visuals . In this work , we aim to explore how people adopt visual narratives on social media along with text to satisfy these specific communication needs , given images’ unique capacity for attention attraction , informational persuasion , and emotional contagion . 2 . 2 Visual Crisis Communication Images inherently own distinguished power in delivering certain kinds of thoughts , experiences , emotions , and knowledge clearly and effectively , the role of which in communication could supple - ment written or oral language in many ways [ 33 , 88 , 101 ] . For instance , images have the potential of arousing emotional resonance crossing the language and cultural divide [ 100 ] . Recent technology development such as high - resolution mobile phone camera and low - cost digital image archives enables amateurs to curate and share images on social media conveniently [ 17 , 87 ] , which make so - cial media imagery a rich research source [ 67 ] . A plethora of work has examined imagery on social media in various areas such as mental health [ 67 ] , societal happiness [ 1 ] , abusive behaviors [ 84 ] and politics [ 87 ] . Online crisis imagery has also attracted growing research attention in HCI and CSCW [ 8 , 9 , 11 , 62 , 74 , 86 , 102 , 107 , 141 ] . Some researchers have exploited the value of crisis imagery , as a special kind of data , to improve crisis - related decision - making , such as disaster type identification [ 6 ] and damage localization [ 62 ] . Existing literature has also investigated how images with different visual characteristics are utilized for crisis communication . Among them , crisis visualizations , one category of images that aims to systematically represent crisis information and augment the quality of risk communication , have been widely explored [ 11 , 89 , 125 , 141 ] . For example , Zhang et al . centered on COVID - 19 crisis visualizations and looked at how they helped to convey information on disease prevalence , epidemiological simulations , and economic and social change [ 141 ] . Crisis memes , one kind of informal crisis imagery that involves participatory creation , also manifests unique roles in crisis communication such as being a visual analogy and visual pun [ 86 ] . Compared to crisis visualizations and memes as categories with special visual features , general crisis images that people post on social media tend to be more miscellaneous in visual topics and patterns , and are used for more diverse communication needs [ 9 ] . For instance , they might be either a random photo recording the life under a crisis , or a screenshot of an article with the latest crisis - related policies . Such nature of the heterogeneity of social media crisis images complicates the analysis that aims to figure out their roles in crisis communication . Focusing on a local outbreak in the aftermath of the COVID - 19 pandemic , we develop an image - clustering approach to effectively group different crisis visual themes ( RQ1 ) as a preliminary step . Based on it , this work further contributes to visual crisis communication by illustrating how social media crisis images satisfy different informational and emotional needs in crises ( RQ2 ) , and what unique strategies they provide to augment crisis communication beyond textual narratives ( RQ3 ) . 2 . 3 Social Media Imagery Analysis Techniques The growth of image use in everyday communication on social media has fueled the development of social media imagery analysis [ 9 , 67 , 139 ] . Researchers have associated image data with other post - or user - relevant information for analysis based on specific tasks , such as text [ 1 , 67 , 84 ] , geospatial data [ 9 ] , social status of the user [ 112 ] , and social engagement [ 7 , 68 ] . For example , Bica Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 8 , No . CSCW2 , Article 01 . Publication date : January 2024 . Images Connect Us Together 01 : 5 et al . revealed the correlation between the severity of a disaster and the image tweet activity based on the geotag information [ 9 ] . Recent work has also begun to look specifically at the visual characteristics of social media im - agery . For instance , Manikonda and Choudhury examined visual features , such as color palettes and visual saliency , that were manifested through mental health images on Instagram [ 67 ] . Visual themes are another significant topic of concern . Nonetheless , identifying meaningful and interpretable visual themes is a challenging task when images contain high - dimensional features [ 34 ] . Some studies applied qualitative content analysis to establish theme categories ( e . g . , [ 5 , 8 , 12 , 86 ] ) , but content analysis suffers from scalability and reproducibility concerns . The recent progress of com - puter vision and deep learning enables more accurate quantitative thematic analysis at scale . Two representative approaches are supervised image classification [ 36 , 127 ] and unsupervised image clustering [ 139 ] . Image clustering has exhibited its great performance in discovering meaningful patterns that are less subject to human annotation [ 46 , 67 , 85 , 87 , 139 ] . Nonetheless , extracting low - dimensional representations of images remains a bottleneck for image clustering tasks [ 139 ] . To present images as low - dimensional vectors , some prior work relied on human - assigned feature codes [ 87 ] , and another line of scholarship leveraged visual feature descriptors like Scale - Invariant Feature Transform ( SIFT ) [ 22 ] and Speeded Up Robust Features ( SURF ) [ 67 ] . Transfer learning - based feature extraction , with the development of pretrained deep learning models , has recently shown tremendous potential in social media imagery analysis . For example , Zhang and Peng compared different visual feature extraction methods for political image clustering , and revealed that transfer learning significantly outperformed other methods [ 139 ] . Despite the advancement in imagery analysis techniques [ 48 , 139 ] , the setting of social media imagery during a COVID - 19 local outbreak presents additional challenges to the analysis . First , emotional connections through visuals characterize the event , expressing both “positive energy” to establish public confidence [ 66 ] , or anxiety and annoyance under “lockdown” fatigue [ 16 , 95 ] . It necessitates multimodal sentiment analysis to understand and monitor public reactions [ 48 ] . Second , public discourse on local outbreaks naturally intersects with social and political issues under crisis management of the local government [ 16 , 70 ] . Therefore , situating imagery analysis within the specific sociopolitical context is crucial in this setting . Finally , it is significant for the imagery analysis to consider the heterogeneity of visual narratives during the crisis on social media [ 86 , 105 ] . This work customizes image clustering with visual features extracted by transfer learning to comprehensively unpack crisis image themes during a COVID - 19 local outbreak . We also apply qualitative thematic and sentiment analysis to capture a more in - depth understanding of the goals and strategies of social media crisis imagery during the event . 3 METHOD We adopted a mixed - methods approach to examine the characteristics of social media crisis imagery in a COVID - 19 local outbreak . To systematically unpack crisis visual themes ( RQ1 , Section 3 . 3 ) , we used image clustering to discern different visual elements in crisis imagery . To understand their crisis communication goals ( RQ2 , Section 3 . 4 ) , we developed text classifiers to extract information and sentiments from original posts of crisis images , and made comparisons among different crisis visual themes . To further figure out the strategic use of images for these crisis communication goals ( RQ3 , Section 3 . 5 ) , we conducted inductive coding of crisis image samples in the post context , unearthing its unique values in enhancing crisis communication . The overall analytic flow of this study is described in Figure 1 . Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 8 , No . CSCW2 , Article 01 .

The analytic flow to understand visual crisis communication during a COVID - 19 local outbreak . 3 . 1 Study Event : Xi’an COVID - 19 Local Outbreak The Xi’an COVID - 19 local outbreak , caused mainly by SARS - CoV - 2 Delta variant [ 76 ] , is regarded as the most severe COVID - 19 local outbreak in China after Wuhan outbreak as of January 2022 [ 126 ] . The first COVID - 19 case of this event was reported on December 9 , 2021 [ 126 ] , at which time COVID - 19 had infected more than 260 million people worldwide and caused more than 5 million deaths [ 81 ] . Following a dynamic zero - COVID strategy , the local government imposed a lockdown on December 23 , 2021 , which lasted for about one month till January 24 , 2022 [ 126 ] . The lockdown implemented a stay - at - home order , in which citizens needed permission to leave residential compounds or the city , affecting 13 million local residents [ 140 ] . A total of 2053 cases were reported in Xi’an during this event [ 126 ] . We focus on visual crisis communication in this event as a typical example of a COVID - 19 local outbreak with lockdown management , which might contribute to the understanding of civic response in similar health crisis events with highly contagious viruses , varied and strict management measures , and uncertain local situations . 3 . 2 Data Collection We chose Weibo as the research site , which is the largest Chinese microblogging website and a significant social media platform for crisis communication in China [ 15 , 91 , 132 ] . To determine the data inclusion criteria , we first randomly browsed posts related to the Xi’an COVID - 19 Local Outbreak . We finally chose the most frequent keyword “ Xi’an epidemic ” ( which sometimes appeared as a hashtag ) for data collection . Applying the WeiboSuperSpider tool [ 49 ] , we crawled posts whose text included the “ Xi’an epidemic ” keyword and collected all the images within them . The data covered the period from December 9 , 2021 , when the first COVID - 19 case was reported in this event , to January 24 , 2022 , the date when the Xi’an government lifted the lockdown . In total , we retrieved 345 , 423 relevant posts , and kept the 71 , 779 original posts contributed by 39 , 866 distinct users as the target dataset . Among them , 29 , 075 posts ( 40 . 5 % ) had one or more images , and the total Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 8 , No . CSCW2 , Article 01 . Publication date : January 2024 . Images Connect Us Together 01 : 7 # Xi ' an Epidemic # This morning , I was still feeling happy and showing off that I received a package . This means that we will soon be lifted from the lockdown . However , in the evening , the community group received an urgent notice for nucleic acid testing . The reason is probably because there was a cluster of 1 patient infecting more than 40 people in our neighborhood . We went downstairs in order , lined up for theswab test . Today ' s tester was really gentle , but starting from tomorrow , we won ' t be able to receive packages again . # Xi ' an Epidemic # My friend receivedthe second batch of supplies .

Two examples with visual use in the dataset of crisis - related posts during the Xi’an local outbreak . image number was 66 , 183 . We kept 65 , 376 images after excluding GIFs , which contained multiple frames and may produce unreliable results for static visual analysis . Generally , posts in the collected dataset received an average of 48 . 5 likes ( SD = 2093 . 0 ) , 7 . 2 comments ( SD = 130 . 7 ) , and 2 . 9 shares ( SD = 59 . 5 ) . On average , posts with images received slightly higher user engagement , with an average of 54 . 4 likes ( SD = 2007 . 8 ) , 8 . 7 comments ( SD = 131 . 2 ) , and 3 . 2 shares ( SD = 45 . 1 ) , compared to posts without images which received an average of 44 . 5 likes ( SD = 2149 . 0 ) , 6 . 1 comments ( SD = 130 . 4 ) , and 2 . 6 shares ( SD = 67 . 6 ) . The average post length was 164 . 6 ( SD = 246 . 5 ) . In addition to the de - facto hashtag “ # Xi’an epidemic # ” in the event ( N = 20 , 144 , also as the keyword for collection ) , the other 5 most frequent hashtags included “ # Xi’an # ” ( N = 2028 ) , “ # Come on Xi’an # ” ( N = 1605 ) , “ # Diary of Fighting Against the Epidemic in Xi’an # ” ( N = 861 ) , “ # Epidemic prevention and control # ” ( N = 560 ) and “ # Xi’an Epidemic Updates # ” ( N = 501 ) . We provide two example posts with visuals in Figure 2 to familiarize readers with the dataset . There were several considerations regarding the limitation of the dataset . First , we only used one most widely - adopted keyword “ Xi’an epidemic ” for data collection . As also the de - facto hashtag / super - topic [ 15 ] of this local outbreak on Weibo , this keyword was representative to collect a sufficiently large dataset for quantitative analysis and capture different themes of user - generated posts regarding the event . We did not include other keywords such as “ Xi’an quarantine life ” or “ Xi’an epidemic updates ” that might introduce a bias towards specific aspects of the out - break . However , this keyword could not ensure the comprehensiveness of data collection , as some pertinent posts might be omitted . Second , we collected data on March 14 , 2022 , i . e . , 50 days after the event , so that the engagement indexes of posts ( e . g . , likes and shares ) stabilized for a fair comparison . Nonetheless , it inevitably led to the loss of some posts , especially under factors such as self - deleting outdated crisis - related posts [ 40 ] . Finally , different from Twitter , Weibo adopts a more flexible setting on post visibility , including “public” , “followers” , “social circle ( mutual followers ) ” , “selected friends” and “private” [ 124 ] . We only managed to collect the public posts , which limited the dataset size to some extent and was potentially skewed towards more public disclosure . 3 . 3 RQ1 : Uncovering Visual Content Themes with an Image Clustering Approach To have a preliminary understanding of what users disclosed and shared through images during the COVID - 19 local outbreak , we first aimed to unpack the themes of social media crisis images . We chose unsupervised image clustering with transfer learning for feature extraction [ 139 ] to categorize the data . Compared to the widely - adopted image content analysis of manually coding images and assigning theme labels [ 8 , 86 , 141 ] , image clustering can scale image analysis to larger datasets Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 8 , No . CSCW2 , Article 01 . Publication date : January 2024 . 01 : 8 Changyang He et al . and is less subject to reproducibility concerns . Also , in contrast to supervised image classification , image clustering is not restricted by the size and quality of the human - labeled training dataset . The recent development of transfer learning and deep neural networks further brings great potential for image clustering , especially in categorizing miscellaneous social media images [ 139 ] . Therefore , image clustering is well applicable for identifying visual themes of crisis imagery in the context of this work . As our ultimate goal was to generate coherent clusters with pure and explainable content themes , we adopted within - cluster consistency [ 139 ] as a quantitative measure of whether our clusters were internally consistent . Specifically , within - cluster consistency denoted the proportion of the most common theme in a human - annotated sample for a given cluster ( similar to “semantic validity” in unsupervised topic modeling [ 35 ] ) . We averaged within - cluster consistency of all clusters to evaluate the performance of each image clustering approach and selected models based on it . 3 . 3 . 1 Transfer Learning for Low - Dimensional Feature Extraction . We adopted transfer learning [ 114 ] to extract low - dimensional features of high - dimensional pixel representations of images , which is the bottleneck of unsupervised image clustering [ 139 ] . It outperforms visual - element - based extrac - tion approaches such as bag - of - visual - words models [ 65 , 104 , 139 ] , and achieves good performances in a variety of imagery analysis tasks [ 77 , 139 ] . To find a suitable pretrained model , we performed a pilot experiment on 1000 image samples and tried various popular pretrained deep learning models , including VGG16 [ 103 ] , VGG19 [ 103 ] , ResNet [ 42 ] , MobileNet [ 45 ] and MobileNetV2 [ 99 ] , for feature extraction . All models were pre - trained on ImageNet [ 24 ] , a large image database covering 1000 general categories , and thus had the generalizability to fit into our dataset . Specifically , we first resized images to 224 × 224 pixel with RGB color mode , fed images into each candidate model with pre - trained weights on the ImageNet [ 24 ] , and generated the last layer as the low - dimensional representations of images [ 139 ] . Then , we applied a basic clustering method ( K - means [ 64 ] ) to the extracted features . We also exper - imented with a traditional feature extraction approach for comparison , i . e . , the bag - of - visual - words model extracting scale - invariant visual features [ 104 ] . When varying the value of K , we found 5 clusters generally yielded a high silhouette score ( a metric measuring clustering quality [ 96 ] ) as well as meaningful results across different feature extraction models . Therefore , we set 𝐾 = 5 for a fair comparison . After clustering , two coders manually coded visual themes of 100 samples ( 5 clusters × 20 samples in each cluster ) for each candidate model , compared labels , and discussed to reach a consensus . They examined the performance with within - cluster consistency ( Appendix A ) . The evaluation indicated that different pretrained models all outperformed the bag - of - visual - words model and did not exhibit substantially different performance among them . As such , we finally chose MobileNetV2 [ 99 ] with the highest feature extraction speed to facilitate further experiments when scaling up to the whole dataset . Assisted by MobileNetV2 , we represented each image in the dataset ( 224 × 224 × 3 ) as a 1280 - dimension vector , which was the last hidden layer ( global average pooling layer [ 99 ] ) . 3 . 3 . 2 Image Clustering . After converting images to low - dimensional representations , we adopted clustering to uncover visual content themes that were accurate and interpretable . First , we tried different types of clustering methods , including centroid - based ( i . e . , K - means [ 64 ] ) , density - based ( i . e . , DBSCAN [ 55 ] ) and distribution - based ( i . e . , Gaussian Mixture Model [ 94 ] ) ap - proaches . Following a similar approach in determining the feature extraction model , we compared different clustering methods based on within - cluster consistency and found that there was no sub - stantial difference between them ( Appendix A ) . Therefore , we chose K - means to categorize crisis images for simplicity . To determine an optimal 𝐾 value , we defined the search space of 𝐾 in a range of 5 to 20 , and computed silhouette scores [ 96 ] for each candidate ; 𝐾 = 6 was finally adopted with Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 8 , No . CSCW2 , Article 01 . Publication date : January 2024 . Images Connect Us Together 01 : 9 a maximal silhouette score . We noticed that most generated clusters were surprisingly pure and clear ( e . g . , text images ) but two clusters were a mixture of sub - themes ( i . e . , diverse types of photos ) . Therefore , we performed a re - splitting and merging step as detailed below . ( 1 ) Sampling : Randomly sampling 50 images for each cluster to measure the within - cluster consistency . It yields 300 image samples ( 50 images × 6 clusters ) in total . ( 2 ) Coding : Two coders independently coded images and assigned theme labels 𝑙 𝑖𝑗 for image 𝑖 in cluster 𝑗 . In particular , the coders first followed a descriptive coding process to analyze visual content [ 97 ] , focusing on visual types ( e . g . , chat screenshots and in - situ photos ) and visual elements ( e . g . , medical staff and food ) . They then conducted pattern coding [ 97 ] to connect fine - grained codes and identify larger visual themes that potentially captured image clusters ( e . g . , assigning the high - level theme label “text images” for relevant codes such as “chat screenshots” and “document photos” ) . They reached a consensus on theme labels through several rounds of meetings , comparisons , and discussions . ( 3 ) Measuring Consistency : For each theme 𝑡 that appeared in Cluster 𝐶 𝑗 , we computed its prevalence 𝑃 𝑡 = (cid:205) 𝑖 ∈ 𝐶𝑗 𝑙 𝑖𝑗 = 𝑡 | 𝐶 𝑗 | , i . e . , the percentage of images belonging to this theme in the cluster . We defined a cluster as “ consistent ” when it had a dominant theme 𝑡 whose prevalence was larger than a dominance threshold 𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑑 𝑑 , i . e . , 𝑃 𝑡 > 𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑑 𝑑 . A larger dominance threshold 𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑑 𝑑 denotes stricter consistency when the dominant theme is required to have a higher proportion in the cluster . In this work , we set 𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑑 𝑑 as 60 % . ( 4 ) Splitting : For each inconsistent cluster , we re - split it according to how many significant themes it contained . Specifically , we selected significant themes 𝑇 𝑠 whose prevalence 𝑃 𝑡 was greater than a significance threshold 𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑑 𝑠 ( We set 𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑑 𝑠 as 20 % in this work ) . Then , we set 𝐾 = | 𝑇 𝑠 | ( number of significant themes ) to separate the inconsistent cluster into 𝐾 sub - clusters using K - means . ( 5 ) Merging : After splitting the inconsistent clusters , we repeated sampling , coding , measuring consistency , and finding the dominant theme for each sub - cluster . No inconsistent sub - cluster was detected in this round . We merged all clusters and sub - clusters with the same dominant theme . In total , the image clustering yielded six clusters with distinct visual themes 1 , including posters , text images , indoor objects , outdoor scenes , people , and food , which will be detailed in Section 4 . 1 . Two coders independently annotated themes of 600 label - assigned samples ( 100 samples × 6 clusters ) as true or false ( i . e . , whether the actual theme of each image corresponded to the label assigned by image clustering ) to evaluate the final performance . After annotation , the authors adopted Cohen’s kappa to validate inter - rater reliability [ 71 ] . The high Cohen’s kappa ( 𝜅 = 0 . 86 ) suggested strong agreement between the two coders and strengthened the validity of the manual evaluation . The evaluation generated an average recall of 79 . 5 % , indicating the substantially good performance of image clustering in uncovering visual themes . Within all image clusters , we noticed that indoor objects and outdoor scenes were two relatively general categories , which communicated diverse indoor and outdoor activities valuable in the event ( e . g . , community nucleic acid test ) , and thus could benefit from a fine - grained classification to generate more meaningful results . Therefore , we applied deep learning models fine - tuned on specific scene - based datasets to predict scenes or items . To identify indoor objects , we chose MIT Indoor Scenes dataset as one of the benchmark datasets for indoor scene recognition [ 93 ] . To discern outdoor scenes , we chose Places365 database as one of the authoritative datasets for scene 1 Note that it is a coincidence that the number of clusters ( six ) equaled the initial 𝐾 value after the splitting and merging steps Proc .

We adopted Vision Transformer ( ViT ) model [ 28 ] fine - tuned on MIT Indoor Scenes dataset and VGG16 [ 103 ] fine - tuned on Places365 database , both of which achieved good performance in the specific task [ 54 , 119 ] . 3 . 4 RQ2 : Investigating Visual Crisis Communication Goals with Text Analysis of Original Posts RQ1 focused on visual features and generated a comprehensive taxonomy of crisis image themes during a COVID - 19 local outbreak . It captured the substantial diversity of crisis imagery , ranging from text - embedded images with the latest policies to photos recording daily quarantine life . This led to a further question : which goals do these diverse types of images serve for crisis communication , and more importantly , how different visual themes are adopted for different crisis communication goals ? To investigate this question , we ( 1 ) performed quantitative text analysis of original posts to unpack crisis communication goals , and ( 2 ) compared different visual themes in the informational and emotional objectives . The quantitative text analysis and inter - image comparison particularly focused on information sharing and sentiment expression , two significant communication objectives in crisis settings [ 41 , 91 , 92 , 118 , 136 ] . 3 . 4 . 1 Text Analysis of Original Posts . We developed information and emotion classifiers for original post analysis as a preliminary step to figure out the visual goals , i . e . , how different types of crisis images were used to fulfill different crisis communication needs . Information Theme Classifier : To identify which types of information were disseminated in the local outbreak - related posts , we developed a codebook through inductive thematic analysis , and leveraged a text classifier to generalize the information themes to the whole corpus . To establish the codebook of information themes , we used inductive thematic analysis to code a sample of posts [ 30 ] , capturing the codes naturally reflecting the topics of crisis - related posts . Specifically , two coders carefully read through 200 post samples independently , and generated codes of information themes ( e . g . , “ latest policies and measures ” ) that described the data . Through several rounds of discussions and comparisons , they reached a consensus on the theme codes of crisis - related posts as shown in Table 1 , and returned to annotating every post in the 200 samples based on the four type labels . The Cohen’s Kappa ( 𝜅 = 0 . 91 ) suggested substantial inter - rater agreement between the two coders [ 71 ] . Finally , the two coders separately annotated another 400 posts each , generating 1 , 000 theme - assigned samples as the training dataset . An additional sample of 200 posts was further labeled as the test dataset . The annotation process also helped the two coders validate that the four information types were inclusive to describe user - generated posts during the event with no new code emerging . Generally , the information themes aligned with the public response on Chinese social media during the early COVID - 19 outbreak such as the discussion on management measures [ 41 , 60 , 120 ] . However , as a COVID - 19 resurgence , little discourse focused on the causative agent , prevention knowledge , and epidemiological characteristics [ 60 , 131 ] . Meanwhile , life recording during lockdown characterized the event with prolonged abnormal living conditions . We applied Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers ( BERT ) [ 26 ] to classify the local - outbreak - related posts for its good performance and generalizability in text classification tasks . Specifically , we adopted BERT - wwm , a Chinese BERT model pretrained on Chinese Wikipedia [ 20 ] , and fine - tuned it with our training dataset ( N = 1000 ) to adjust it to our specific tasks . The micro f1 - score achieved 82 . 1 % in the test dataset ( N = 200 ) , indicating its substantially good performance . Finally , we leveraged the information theme classifier to assign theme labels to the whole dataset of original posts ( N = 71 , 779 ) . Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 8 , No .

Reminder : Keep social distance and protect yourself . 11 . 9 % Emotional Type Classifier : To identify emotional types of text posts , we first tried some widely - adopted Chinese emotion prediction models ( e . g . , Jingdong Sentiment API 2 and SnowNLP 3 ) , yet we noticed that these models were not well - applicable to our context through manual evaluation . Therefore , we followed an emotion identification method similar to our information theme classifi - cation approach , including ( 1 ) codebook establishment through open coding [ 19 ] on 100 samples by two authors , capturing emotions in this specific scenario ( five emotion types shown below ) ; ( 2 ) validation of inter - rater reliability on assigning the five emotion types with Cohen’s Kappa ( N = 100 , 𝜅 = 0 . 91 ) ; ( 3 ) annotation on training dataset ( N = 1000 ) and test dataset ( N = 200 ) ; and ( 4 ) BERT - based emotional type classification ( micro f1 - score = 78 . 6 % on 5 - class emotion classification ) . The open coding indicated that a single label could well represent each post , and five emotion classes were identified to effectively describe emotions in our samples : • Positive - Hopeful ( 19 . 9 % 4 ) : Mutual encouragement and wishes to overcome the difficulty ; • Positive - Appreciative ( 4 . 3 % ) : Gratitude to medical staff , community workers , and other social connections in the local outbreak ; • Neutral ( 52 . 2 % ) : Neutral posts such as news , latest policies , and unemotional life recording ; • Negative - Annoyed ( 11 . 9 % ) : Feeling of annoyance when normal life was disturbed by the local outbreak and relevant measures ; • Negative - Anxious ( 11 . 7 % ) : The nervousness and worry due to the uncertainty during the local outbreak ( e . g . , uncertain lockdown time and food supply ) . 2 https : / / neuhub . jd . com / ai / api / nlp / sentiment 3 https : / / github . com / isnowfy / snownlp 4 Percentage of each emotion denotes its proportion in the 1000 training dataset .

After identifying the information theme and emotion type of each post , we extracted the crisis image category of the post established in RQ1 ( or the dominant category based on frequency if the post contained more than one image ) . We investigated how the transmitted information themes and emotions correlated with ( 1 ) whether crisis images were used or not , and ( 2 ) which types of crisis images were used . Particularly , we compared different image types on the information or emotion categories of posts to investigate their differences in informational and emotional goals . We also performed chi - square tests [ 72 ] to validate the statistical significance of such differences , i . e . , whether different image types had significantly different information and emotion distributions . 3 . 5 RQ3 : Understanding Strategies of Crisis Images with Inductive Coding RQ1 and RQ2 leveraged computational approaches across visual and linguistic modalities to com - prehensively unpack the rich themes and the nuanced informational and emotional goals of crisis imagery . The comparison of crisis communication goals among visual themes helped to statistically depict the inter - modality correlation between visual and text . Moving a further step , a more in - depth investigation of such inter - modality correlation , especially the strategic use of visuals to enhance crisis communication as a whole , could deepen the understanding of crisis image use . Therefore , we applied inductive coding to qualitatively look into the visual strategies in crisis communication , i . e . , how crisis images facilitated information sharing and sentiment expression in the specific context . Specifically , we sampled 1200 distinct images ( 200 images × 6 visual theme categories ) identified in Section 3 . 3 , and situated them within the original posts . We conducted inductive thematic analysis [ 30 ] and inductive emotion coding [ 86 ] on the data . Two authors ( 1 ) inductively coded the information themes and emotions expressed in both the image samples and corresponding post text ; ( 2 ) compared visual - based and language - based information and emotions ; ( 3 ) figured out how they were related ; and finally ( 4 ) recorded how crisis visuals strategically facilitated the information and emotion sharing . Two coders took an iterative process of coding , comparing , and discussing to resolve the difference and finalize the codebook . The coding reached saturation given the sample size , so we did not code more data . This step of qualitative analysis helped to unpack how visual narratives manifested unique values and complemented text in crisis communication . After qualitatively identifying specific visual strategies , we also presented relevant quantitative evidence to illustrate their prevalence and potential correlations with user engagement , affording a more thorough understanding of the result . 4 FINDINGS This work provides a comprehensive description of the themes , goals , and strategies of crisis imagery during a COVID - 19 local outbreak , promoting the understanding of visual crisis communication in general social media crisis images . In Section 4 . 1 , we describe the taxonomy of crisis visual themes obtained from image clustering , showing distinct features of different visuals in the event . We further demonstrate how these crisis image themes were substantially correlated with different informational and emotional objectives in Section 4 . 2 , unearthing the specialized use of crisis images in crisis communication . In Section 4 . 3 , we depict several unique strategies of visuals that contributed to effective crisis communication . Overall , these findings uncover not only the rich features of social media crisis imagery , but also its special values in promoting situational awareness and establishing emotional connections . 4 . 1 RQ1 : Visual Themes The image clustering yielded six representative visual themes as shown in Figure 3 , including two text - embedded image categories [ 67 ] : posters and text images ; and four “visual diary” image Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 8 , No . CSCW2 , Article 01 . Publication date : January 2024 . Images Connect Us Together 01 : 13 categories that recorded life during the outbreak : indoor objects , outdoor scenes , people , and food . These crisis image themes communicated distinct visual elements in the local outbreak to enhance situational awareness and establish emotional connections . We detailed descriptive analysis of different visual themes , and started with two text - embedded image categories : • Posters ( 22 . 7 % , N = 14 , 836 ) : Images embedding some big - character text , especially with a solid - color background . Different from images with rich text about crisis information ( text images ) , posters generally only had meta information ( e . g . , “latest news” in Figure 3 Posters , B ) of the post . Some poster - style photos , especially photos of COVID - 19 - related press conferences with the agency name embedded in a solid - color background ( e . g . , Figure 3 Posters , A and E ) , also characterized this category . The highlighted text information of posters helped to convey the core message and catch users’ eyes at a glance . In a similar visual style , text - embedded visualizations and memes ( e . g . , Figure 3 Posters , H ) were also categorized into this visual theme though not in a great amount . • Text images ( 16 . 0 % , N = 10 , 434 ) : Images with plentiful embedded text . We noticed that plenty of authoritative regulations ( e . g . , the lockdown measures of the city ) and community guide - lines ( e . g . , communities’ COVID - 19 test notice ) were shared by local residents in the form of images such as screenshots of government - posted articles , potentially due to the convenience of forwarding images in and outside the Weibo platform . Screenshots of chat messages ( e . g . , Figure 3 Text Images , J ) were another type of text image that provided situational infor - mation with original sources , such as the latest suggestions posted by community officers in a community group chat . Meanwhile , text images were also observed to convey some sensitive messages , such as conflicts with supply providers and rumors faked as chat logs with “political insiders” , to circumvent moderation . Below are the four “visual diary” image categories : • Indoor objects ( 17 . 6 % , N = 11 , 480 ) : Images capturing indoor objects that recorded everyday life during the lockdown . This category reflected people’s resilience during this isolated lifestyle , such as making handicrafts ( Figure 3 Indoor Objects , I ) and decorations ( Figure 3 Indoor Objects , A ) . Self - disclosure of mental status in quarantine such as anxiety or hopefulness was typical along with this type of visual diary , which is further demonstrated in Section 4 . 2 . According to the model pretrained on specific indoor scenes [ 119 ] , the top 5 most frequent indoor items include ( 1 ) buffet ( 9 . 4 % , N = 1082 ) : Food supply and cooking 5 ; ( 2 ) artstudio ( 9 . 3 % , N = 1072 ) : Handicrafts , paintings , calligraphy , and homework ; ( 3 ) inside _ subway ( 7 . 8 % , N = 894 ) : Actually as close - range photos of indoor family activities ( e . g . , playing with pets ) ; ( 4 ) airport _ inside ( 4 . 8 % , N = 553 ) : Actually as spacious lobbies ( sometimes with people queuing for the nucleic acid test ) ; ( 5 ) greenhouse ( 4 . 8 % , N = 550 ) : Potted plants , vegetables , fruits . • Outdoor scenes ( 17 . 2 % , N = 11 , 234 ) : Outdoor photos such as streets , parks and attractions . Many images in this category demonstrated the emptiness of the city during the COVID - 19 lockdown ( e . g . , Figure 3 Outdoor Scenes , C ) , expressing the wish for a normal life . Also , some outdoor photos served as real - time proof of situations in the local community , such as the location of checkpoints of movement pass ( Figure 3 Outdoor Scenes , D ) and the crowdedness of a specific COVID - 19 test point that reminded community members to come later ( Figure Outdoor Scenes , J ) . According to the scene - based pre - trained model [ 54 ] , the top 5 most frequent outdoor items are ( 1 ) staircase ( 16 . 0 % , N = 1795 ) : Actually as Chinese buildings especially ancient towers with storeyed shapes , such as Figure 11 B ; ( 2 ) artstudio ( 14 . 0 % , N = 1574 ) : Supply distribution points ; ( 3 ) ice _ cream _ parlor ( 7 . 7 % , N = 868 ) : Actually as the lockdown checkpoints or COVID - 19 test points ; ( 4 ) campus ( 5 . 1 % , N = 576 ) : ( empty ) campus 5 We note the contextual interpretations of each category after observing a series of examples with the given label .

Image content themes during the Xi’an COVID - 19 local outbreak based on image clustering ( each row represents one image cluster ) . The image examples of each cluster ( N = 10 ) were picked from random samples ( N = 20 ) , instead of crisis images nearest to cluster centers , to demonstrate the in - cluster diversity . grounds and buildings ; ( 5 ) hospital ( 4 . 0 % , N = 447 ) : Outdoor scenes with doctors or workers in biohazard suites . • People ( 16 . 9 % , N = 11 , 040 ) : Images of humans in the outbreak . Two important sub - themes of this category were ( 1 ) selfies and photos of families ( e . g . , Figure 3 People , A and I ) , notable types of social media images to show their lives to others and connect with audiences [ 46 , 67 , 69 ] , which might be valuable for social connections during lockdown ; and ( 2 ) photos of medical staff and community workers , some recording and appreciating their contributions and sacrifices during the crisis ( e . g . , Figure 3 People , F ) , and some showing conflicts between community workers and residents and criticizing specific workers on their abuse of power during the lockdown ( e . g . , Figure 3 People , H ) . Note that the theme People did not necessarily contradict with indoor objects or outdoor themes ; both the two categories also contained a noteworthy proportion of photos with humans . However , we noticed that compared to people , human images categorized into outdoor scenes typically suggested significant environmental knowledge ( e . g . , surroundings of the lockdown checkpoint and COVID - 19 test queue in Figure 3 Outdoor Scenes , D & J ) , while those classified as indoor objects often “spotlighted” items of quarantine life ( e . g . , Christmas tree in Figure 3 Indoor Objects , A and supply in Figure 3 Indoor Objects , G ) . Such subtle differences captured by the model were meaningful in distinguishing different crisis - related messages in the event . • Food ( 9 . 7 % , N = 6 , 532 ) : plated food and drinks . In addition to recording everyday dishes , these food images also communicated information about the food supply of the local community during the lockdown to other affected citizens in the city . Different visual themes exhibited substantial differences in public engagement indexes ( i . e . , likes , comments , and shares ) as shown in Figure 4 . The differences in average comments and shares between visual themes were statistically significant under the one - way ANOVA test ( 𝑝 < 0 . 05 ) . Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput .

Comparison of different visual themes in public engagement indexes : ( a ) likes , ( b ) comments , and ( c ) shares . Generally , users were most engaged in posts with posters images which received the most likes , comments , and shares , followed by text images . In comparison , users were less engaged in the other four “visual diary” categories . One potential reason might be that visual messages passed through posters and text images ( e . g . , screenshots of government - posted articles ) were more likely to be generalized to different settings and useful to other citizens , while photos recording daily life might be more personal and related to specific scenarios . RQ1 Summary : Through image clustering , we captured a comprehensive taxonomy of crisis visual themes during a COVID - 19 local outbreak , including posters and text images as two text - embedded categories , and four “visual diary” types presenting life in lockdown . These visual themes attracted different levels of user engagement ( e . g . , posters and text images received more likes , comments , and shares ) . It demonstrated the diversity of visual communication during a local outbreak in Chinese social media , and implicitly reflected some specialized use of crisis images , such as the prevalence of posters relating to the latest and authoritative information . In the next section , we explicitly described how these diverse visual themes were adopted for different informational and emotional goals , providing a quantitative view of visual - text correlation . 4 . 2 RQ2 : Visual Goals Through text analysis of the posts that contained crisis images , we unveiled how different themes of crisis images were adopted for different objectives in information sharing and emotional expression during the COVID - 19 outbreak . These findings provided a comprehensive picture of the crisis communication goals of crisis images . 4 . 2 . 1 Descriptive Statistics . Using the information theme classifier described in Section 3 . 4 . 1 , we captured the proportion of four information themes in crisis - related posts during the local outbreak . Specifically , situational information ( N = 26 , 963 , 37 . 6 % ) and attitude disclosure ( N = 25 , 291 , 35 . 2 % ) were the two most popular information categories . The prevalence of these two categories echoes prior works on crisis response [ 40 , 91 , 92 ] . Life recording under lockdown accounted for 20 . 0 % crisis - related posts ( N = 14 , 389 ) , and information about the latest policies and measures had the smallest proportion ( N = 7 . 2 % , N = 5 , 136 ) . The text emotion analysis revealed that in addition to the neutral category , two negative emotions ( i . e . , annoyed and anxious ) and two positive emotions ( i . e . , hopeful and appreciative ) characterized emotions that users disclosed during the local outbreak . In the whole dataset , the total proportion of negative emotions ( 22 . 5 % , with 𝑃 𝑎𝑛𝑥𝑖𝑜𝑢𝑠 = 12 . 4 % and 𝑃 𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑜𝑦𝑒𝑑 = 10 . 1 % ) was close to the total proportion of positive emotions ( 23 . 4 % , 𝑃 ℎ𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑓𝑢𝑙 = 20 . 0 % and 𝑃 𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 = 3 . 4 % ) . Therefore , there was an upsurge in negative emotions in the aftermath of the pandemic compared to the initial COVID - 19 outbreak in Wuhan in Chinese social media [ 121 ] . It highlighted the prevalence of Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 8 , No . CSCW2 , Article 01 . Publication date : January 2024 . 01 : 16 Changyang He et al .

Temporal trend of the volume , information themes , and emotion types of crisis - related posts during Xi’an COVID - 19 local outbreak . anxiety and annoyance , serving as a warning of unhealthy mental well - being that might be due to COVID - 19 fatigue [ 25 , 128 ] under repetitive and uncertain outbreaks . Figure 5 described the temporal trends of post volume , information themes and emotion types during the event . The number of posts gradually increased at the early stage of the outbreak , and reached the first peak on Dec . 22 , 2021 with the announcement of lockdown [ 126 ] . The discourse gradually tapered off around Jan . 10 , 2022 when the social transmission was controlled with no new cases [ 126 ] . The information themes and emotion types exhibited notable temporal patterns along with the development of the local outbreak . Specifically , latest policies and measures accounted for a significant proportion during the initial and final phases of the event . Situational information gradually grew at the onset of the outbreak and became stable since the lockdown . Besides , attitude disclosure was prevalent until the outbreak was brought under basic control . For emotion types , anxious prevailed at the outset of the outbreak , and annoyed manifested two peaks , one during the initial lockdown period and another after the lockdown had been in effect for some time . Meanwhile , hopeful posts remained in a great amount during the lockdown period with the decrease of cases . These descriptive statistics helped to contextualize the crisis imagery regarding information sharing and sentiment expression in the corpus . Next , we focused on how different types of crisis images were adopted for different informational and emotional goals . 4 . 2 . 2 Information Sharing . Figure 6 demonstrates the proportions of crisis information themes in different types of crisis images . Through a chi - square test , we revealed that there was a statistically significant difference in shared information among different crisis image types ( 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . It suggests that the types of images used in a post largely correlated with the messages the post aimed to target . We underscore the following critical findings : ( 1 ) Compared to crisis - related posts without images , image - attached posts were far more widely adopted to share the latest policies and measures . It indicates that images were widely leveraged to signify or demonstrate formal and official information , which will be further illustrated in Section 4 . 3 ; ( 2 ) posters contained the highest proportion of situational information ( 41 . 05 % , N = 3617 ) and the latest policies and measures ( 21 . 99 % , N = 1938 ) , followed by text images . In comparison , all remaining categories had less than 25 % situational information and less than 5 % latest policies and measures . This finding indicates that posters and text images had been broadly used to transmit policies and other situational information that were crucial in crisis response ; ( 3 ) People , outdoor scenes , indoor objects and food all had a high proportion ( greater than 70 % ) of posts for life recording under lockdown and attitude disclosure .

Distribution of crisis - related information themes in different types of crisis images . The chi - square test indicates a statistically significant difference in shared information among different crisis image types ( 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . Therefore , these four crisis image categories largely captured and embodied the public livelihood and mentality , which is crucial when strict lockdown measures are enforced [ 3 , 98 ] . 4 . 2 . 3 Sentiment Expression . Figure 7 demonstrates the proportions of crisis - related emotions in different types of crisis images . The chi - square test denoted that there was a statistically significant difference in expressed emotions among different crisis image types ( 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . We note the following important findings : ( 1 ) crisis - related posts containing images were generally more positive than posts without images ; ( 2 ) posters was the most emotionally - neutral category containing 72 . 4 % neutral posts ( N = 6379 ) , followed by text images , which might be related to their nature for illustrating or signifying crisis - related information . Nevertheless , text images contained a notable proportion of negative emotions . After manually reviewing a set of samples , we realized that users frequently posted screenshots ( as text images ) to disclose their anxiety when the COVID - 19 situation got worse ( e . g . , screenshots of an authoritative article on newly confirmed cases ) , or annoyance at the negligence of some staff ( e . g . , screenshots of chat revealing some staff’s abuse of power ) ; ( 3 ) outdoor scenes and people were strongly correlated with positive emotions , e . g . , using outdoor scenery to express the wish for a normal life . In particular , the people category had the highest proportion of appreciative emotion , when some users posted photos of medical staff to express their gratitude ; ( 4 ) food was surprisingly the most negative category , especially with the highest anxiety percentage . We observed that some users posted food images to express their worry about food shortages or dissatisfaction with the food supply under lockdown ; ( 5 ) indoor objects , recording the isolated quarantine life , was the most emotional category with high volumes of both positive and negative emotions .

Distribution of crisis - related emotion categories in different types of crisis images . The chi - square test indicates a statistically significant difference in vented emotions among different crisis image types ( 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . Measures ) and five emotion categories ( Hopeful , Appreciative , Neutral , Annoyed , and Anxious ) in the corpus , and quantified their correlations with crisis visual themes . Results indicated statistically significant differences in shared information and expressed emotions among different crisis image types , e . g . , the wide use of posters in disseminating the latest policies and measures , and the preva - lence of anxious emotions regarding food images . These findings demonstrate inter - modality correlations in crisis communication . In the next section , we provide more nuances on such inter - modality correlation , revealing how the strategic use of visuals complemented text narratives and contributed to effective crisis communication . 4 . 3 RQ3 : Visual Strategies In this section , we demonstrate representative strategies of social media images to facilitate cri - sis communication , including images as signs of authority , images as visual - based information enhancement , images as evidence to improve credibility , and images as triggers for empathy . 4 . 3 . 1 Images as Signs of Authority . Adopting crisis images to signify authority surprisingly char - acterized visual crisis communication during the local outbreak in China as shown in Figure 8 . These signposting images , typically as posters or text images , might not contain rich authoritative information in themselves , yet helped to capture public attention , and attracted users to read the post text with authoritative situation updates or guidelines . Typical examples of this strategy are posters with some big - character text ( e . g . , “authoritative statement” in Figure 8a , and “pandemic latest updates” in Figure 8b ) embedded in a solid - color background , a clear indicator of official information in Chinese social media . Poster - style photos of officials in the epidemic prevention press conference ( Figure 8c ) were another kind of sign that implied an authoritative message in the text . Some users also forwarded text images of government documents in COVID - 19 management Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 8 , No . CSCW2 , Article 01 . Publication date : January 2024 . Images Connect Us Together 01 : 19 A B C D authoritative statement Press Conference on the Prevention and Control of COVID - 19 in Xi ' an pandemic latest update Xi ' an Traffic Management Bureau Xi ' an Ecological Environment Bureau Xi ' an Transportation Bureau Document Fig . 8 . Crisis visual strategy 1 : images signifying authority . Images with this strategy can be ( 1 ) big - character text embedded in a solid - color background , e . g . , “authoritative statement” in A and “pandemic latest updates” in B ; ( 2 ) photos of officials such as C , or ( 3 ) government documents such as D . They might not contain rich authoritative information within visual representations , but attract attention to and signify the authority of the post . ( Figure 8d ) to signify the authority of the transmitted text . Original posts along with this crisis image type mostly communicated the latest policies and measures . As the quantitative evidence , about 90 % image - attached posts of latest policies and measures had dominant visual types as posters ( 58 . 8 % ) and text images ( 30 . 7 % ) , accounting for also about 60 % of all latest policies and measures posts . Besides , latest policies and measures posts using posters or text images , typically as authority signs , also attracted more likes ( ¯ 𝑋 𝑙𝑖𝑘𝑒𝑠 = 45 . 2 ) , comments ( ¯ 𝑋 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 = 6 . 8 ) and shares ( ¯ 𝑋 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑠 = 3 . 0 ) on average compared to those with other visuals ( ¯ 𝑋 𝑙𝑖𝑘𝑒𝑠 = 14 . 2 , ¯ 𝑋 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 = 4 . 4 , ¯ 𝑋 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑠 = 2 . 5 ) or without images ( ¯ 𝑋 𝑙𝑖𝑘𝑒𝑠 = 29 . 6 , ¯ 𝑋 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 = 4 . 6 , ¯ 𝑋 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑠 = 1 . 2 ) . These images shed light on how official , organizational , and individual users leveraged visuals to denote and strengthen the authority of posts , and thus promote the transmission and acceptance of the communicated crisis information during the local outbreak . 4 . 3 . 2 Images as Visual - based Information Enhancement . How experts and citizens use data visual - ization language ( e . g . , chart - based temporal visualization and map - based geospatial visualization ) to better present crisis information has been a focus in crisis informatics literature [ 8 , 86 , 141 ] . This work revealed that users leveraged diverse visual representations , as “visualizations” in a broad sense , to convey what was difficult or obscure to express through plain language . Such crisis images well supplemented and enhanced situational crisis information in the post text . For example , Figure 9a applied a diagram to elucidate the relationship and location of the infected population through epidemiological investigation , and Figure 9b used a table to clearly summarize helplines in different districts during the local outbreak . QR codes , a special pattern to condense and route useful crisis information , were also frequently observed to achieve information augmentation , such as in Figure 9c ( public transport update during lockdown ) and Figure 9d ( helplines during lockdown ) . These visualizations were mostly classified into posters with a text - embedded visual style , which comprised 42 . 9 % visual use in situational information . Indeed , posters were not only more likely to be adopted in situational information posts ( compared to the 30 . 5 % posters use among all posts ) , but also achieved higher user engagement in situational information ( ¯ 𝑋 𝑙𝑖𝑘𝑒𝑠 = 189 . 9 , ¯ 𝑋 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 = 18 . 7 , ¯ 𝑋 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑠 = 7 . 0 ) than other visuals ( ¯ 𝑋 𝑙𝑖𝑘𝑒𝑠 = 79 . 7 , ¯ 𝑋 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 = 11 . 9 , ¯ 𝑋 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑠 = 6 . 7 ) . These examples point to ways in which multimodal communication with crisis images could enrich the presented situational knowledge in local outbreaks , going beyond what plain language could capture . 4 . 3 . 3 Images as Evidence to Improve Credibility . Information credibility on social media has been a concern during health crises when rumors , conspiracy , and misinformation abound [ 56 , 106 , 137 ] . We found that social media users widely took images as evidence to improve the credibility of the shared information during the local break . Such visual evidence can either be physical photos Proc .

Crisis visual strategy 2 : images as visual - based information enhancement . Images with this strategy can be ( a ) a diagram demonstrating epidemiological investigation , ( b ) a table summarizing helplines , ( c ) a colored table updating public transport information with a QR code , or ( d ) a QR code linking to helplines . These images , as “visualization” in a broad sense , efficiently convey situational information extending beyond textual narratives . ( e . g . , Figure 10a proving the crowdedness of COVID - 19 test in a local community ) , digital pictures ( e . g . , Figure 10b proving poster’s donation ) , or screenshots of mobile applications ( e . g . , Figure 10c and Figure 10d ) . Such visual evidence was a powerful way to demonstrate one’s difficulties and challenges , especially when social media users in non - affected areas had no concrete idea of the local outbreak situation . For example , Figure 10c used a chat screenshot to reveal the price gouging during the local outbreak , and Figure 10d used a screenshot of an online shopping and ordering platform to give evidence of the supply shortage , both of which were persuasive ways to deliver particular challenges in the crisis . These images provide empirical evidence of how users took advantage of crisis images to convince others on social media . Nevertheless , we warn that visual - enhanced persuasion might potentially be more detrimental when containing unverified information , which is detailed in Section 5 . 1 . 4 . 3 . 4 Images as Triggers for Empathy . Through inductive coding , we identified that images were widely used as triggers to gain empathy and build emotional connections during the outbreak . Such images typically contained cultural , societal , or situational visual constructs that captured the sharing experience of the affected local population . For instance , Figure 11a and Figure 11b represent Terracotta Warriors and ancient buildings respectively , which were cultural symbols of the Xi’an city . The cultural symbols were integrated into the local challenge of the COVID - 19 crisis , serving a role to call for unity and courage to overcome the difficulty . Figure 11c and Figure 11d used field photos of an empty street and a COVID - 19 test at night to raise empathy among local residents under quarantine , expressing the wish for normal life and admiration of medical staff . In particular , we also found that visual use was more prevalent among positive ( hopeful , appreciative ) posts ( 48 . 8 % ) rather than neutral ( 40 . 9 % ) or negative ( annoyed , anxious ) ones ( 29 . 6 % ) , potentially indicating the wider adoption of affective visuals in triggering and transmitting positive energy [ 66 ] . Besides , when both neutral or negative posts had text images and posters as the two most popular visual themes , hopeful posts were mostly characterized by outdoor scenes ( 24 . 6 % ) , potentially due to their use as symbols building emotional proximity ; similarly , appreciative posts had people as the most dominant visual theme ( 28 . 1 % ) , when photos of medical staffs were given emotional values in Proc .

Qin majesty sweep the pandemic Chang’an , may you always be safe Wish you a safe December Fig . 11 . Crisis visual strategy 4 : images as triggers for empathy . Images with this strategy can be local cultural symbols ( Terracotta Warriors in A and ancient buildings in B ) and local field photos ( an empty street in C and a COVID - 19 test at night in D ) . These visual elements could raise empathy among affected citizens with a common ground and transmit specific emotions such as encouragement . collectively expressing gratitude . These examples shed light on how users exploited the power of the emotional contagion of visual symbols for collective emoting during a crisis . RQ3 Summary : In this section , we described rich and nuanced strategies of crisis image use in contributing to effective crisis communication , including images as signs of authority , images as visual - based information enhancement , images as evidence to improve credibility , and images as triggers for empathy . These findings not only revealed the unique values of visual narratives in engaging , persuasion , and emoting , but also reflected how the strategic use of crisis images supplemented and enhanced text narratives to fulfill informational and emotional needs .

In this section , we discuss the opportunities and challenges along with the proliferation of crisis imagery , and rethink the complementary roles of crisis images and language in crisis communication . We finally provide design implications for image - based searching and image - combined moderation to facilitate accurate and effective visual crisis communication . 5 . 1 Unpacking Visual Crisis Communication on Social Media : Opportunities and Challenges Existing work largely focuses on textual crisis communication to comprehend how people collabo - ratively cultivate situational awareness , develop risk perceptions , and provide informational and emotional support on social media under health crises ( e . g . , [ 37 , 56 , 115 ] ) . This work contributes to the literature on crisis communication by comprehensively unpacking the visual use on social media during a COVID - 19 local outbreak . We reveal how crisis imagery could be rich and nuanced in themes , goals , and strategies , and play a significant role in fulfilling diverse communication needs in crises . In this section , we situate our findings within the existing literature , uncovering opportunities and challenges of visual communication . Users developed diverse crisis visual use to adapt to specific needs during local outbreaks . For example , text images embedded rich situational information in a single image , providing a convenient way for cross - platform sharing ; in comparison , posters strengthened the timeliness and credibility with highlighted meta information , managing to capture the audience’s attention to the post text . Even different visual symbols of “visual diary” such as selfies and food , common in general social media for self - disclosure and social connection [ 46 , 67 ] , could convey crisis - specific information that visually enhances mutual understanding , cultivates situational awareness , and facilitates decision making ( e . g . , photos of long queues waiting for COVID - 19 tests implying the crowdedness , and food images indicating community supply ) . These findings reflect the diversity and malleability of crisis imagery in conveying situational information with public wisdom . It provides new evidence of self - organized civic participation and collective intelligence for crisis response [ 21 , 83 ] through social media images , and adds nuances to the understanding of strategic communication in collectively cultivating risk perceptions and assessments [ 23 , 38 ] . In addition , these findings demonstrate that images could be a rich resource for public health researchers to uncover public understanding and attitudes towards health crises and crisis - related policies , which resonates with prior work [ 32 , 44 ] . When images carry significant crisis communication roles , excluding image - based information could potentially lead to biases in understanding public opinions . This work also revealed simple yet powerful emotional narratives [ 86 , 122 ] in crisis images that could raise empathy among those sharing similar experiences and identities as described in Section 4 . 3 . 4 . A photo of an empty fridge might express more anxiety than a large paragraph describing the food shortage , and a motivational poster integrating local cultural symbols might evoke more unity and courage than one thousand words . To this end , visual cues would not only serve as a vehicle for emotional disclosure [ 67 ] , but also establish emotional connections and stimulate solidarity among the affected populations in the crisis . It provides a new perspective on how visual narratives manage to build collective memory [ 87 ] through cultural , societal , and situational constructs to transmit specific emotions during crises . We also discovered the strong correlation between visual cues and the expressed emotions given the specific context in Section 4 . 2 ( e . g . , the prevalence of anxiety in food images ) . These findings provided empirical evidence on how different visual symbols might Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 8 , No . CSCW2 , Article 01 . Publication date : January 2024 . Images Connect Us Together 01 : 23 be given different emotional values in the crisis setting , shedding light on the potential of affective visualization for crisis response [ 86 ] . On the other hand , given that crisis response and politics are tightly intertwined [ 51 ] , we warn that such emotion - embedded crisis images might be exploited to weaponize emotion for political purposes [ 10 , 102 ] or conspiracy theories [ 56 ] . When particular emotions like fear or anger may influence people’s crisis assessment and response [ 23 , 63 ] , weaponized emotion may lead to biased perceptions and even exacerbate rumors and conflicts during crises . Such a hidden danger was particularly notable when prioritizing information valence over veracity characterizes crisis communication in Chinese social media [ 66 ] . As such , it is significant for future work to situate crisis images in the sociopolitical context and examine the dynamics of affective visual narratives surrounding political objectives , persuasive communication , and information credibility . This work also enriches the understanding of how visual - based misinformation [ 13 ] may go viral during local outbreaks . The information gap between local and non - local populations ( or even different local communities during lockdown ) naturally characterizes local outbreaks [ 115 ] , in which crisis images shared by local stakeholders can be particularly persuasive . Section 4 . 3 . 3 indicates that images , whether field photos or digital screenshots , were frequently used as evidence to improve credibility when “pictures don’t lie” . It vastly increases the misinformation risk when pictures do lie - for example , rumors expressed in faked screenshots of chat history [ 75 ] , or appropriated photos from other scenarios [ 9 ] . The emotions embedded in visual narratives may further promote the spread of visual - based misinformation . Therefore , we suggest future researchers look into the dynamics of how image - based misinformation affects local / non - local user perceptions and online / offline crisis response [ 13 , 27 , 113 ] , pay attention to the debunking effort of individuals and communities , and develop AI - supported or crowdsourcing - based countermeasures to cope . 5 . 2 Multimodal Crisis Communication : Rethinking the Complementary Roles of Crisis Images and Language Images and language , two common modalities in social media , have been considered as two supple - mentary vehicles for communication and jointly provide affecting and persuasive narratives [ 67 ] . Nonetheless , how visual and linguistic elements complement each other to fulfill informational and emotional needs in crisis communication has been less investigated . This work reveals the nuances of the complementary roles of the two modalities in crisis communication . Through qualitative analysis of crisis images within the context of a post , we revealed the distinct strategies of images to spotlight , enhance , and enrich situational information in the text . Images could either serve as simple yet powerful signs of authority ( Section 4 . 3 . 1 ) , catching public attention on the text - based authoritative guidelines ; work as an auxiliary component to support and verify the linguistic argument ( Section 4 . 3 . 3 ) , visually improving the information credibility ; or embody rich situational information within images themselves through various visualization approaches ( Section 4 . 3 . 2 ) , thus breaking the limit that text can express . These findings enrich the understanding of multimodal information sharing [ 82 ] by unpacking dynamics of visual - language correlations in crises . Crisis images are more than a standalone component with visualized information , but connect with text and enhance the entire information through attention attraction , credibility indication [ 82 ] and information embodiment [ 86 ] . These visual - language correlations exhibit the potential to correspondingly alleviate the critical challenges in heterogeneity , credibility , and quality of crisis information on social media [ 83 ] . Moreover , the inter - modality correlations also afford user empowerment with evolving user - developed strategies for effective crisis communication , which resonates with prior work [ 41 , 90 ] . To this end , we call for more fine - grained investigations of public strategies in establishing visual - language correlations to cope with specific challenges Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 8 , No . CSCW2 , Article 01 . Publication date : January 2024 . 01 : 24 Changyang He et al . in crisis communication ( e . g . , attracting attention to critical posts among heterogeneous crisis information [ 40 ] ) , and how they influence risk perceptions and emergency responses . Social media images also play an irreplaceable role that complements language in communicat - ing emotions during crises . On the one hand , visual elements afford particular values in emotion expression through emotion embodiment [ 86 ] and emotion contagion through constructing col - lective memory [ 9 , 87 ] , which extend beyond linguistic narratives . On the other hand , when image - based emotion venting might suffer from ambiguity and subjectivity in interpretation [ 9 ] , language is critical for contextualizing the visual constructs and facilitating emotion comprehen - sion , achieving complementarity in emotional communication . On this note , it is warranted for future work to examine the strategic use and misuse of inter - modality emotional connections in crisis settings . For example , it is significant in understanding how conspiracy theorists may build malicious inter - modality connections [ 73 ] , e . g . , situating unrelated but emotional crisis images within misinformation , to promote the spread of crisis - related rumors . Generally , this work enriches the understanding of inter - modality correlation that empowers users for strategic crisis communication . Unpacking such inter - modality correlation would be as important as understanding information in each modality . Therefore , we suggest a holistic view that takes the text and visual as an organic whole for further researchers to get a comprehensive understanding of multimodal crisis communication [ 116 ] , focusing on not only the uniqueness of one modality , but also the correlation and complementarity between modalities . 5 . 3 Design Implications 5 . 3 . 1 Implications for Crisis Information Seeking . This work unpacks the significant role of crisis imagery , from authoritative guidelines through text images to situation descriptions through on - site photos , in communicating situational crisis information . Such public - generated visual knowledge , as supplements to textual information , is meaningful for both local victims who may be subject to movement restrictions and non - local people who may lack a comprehensive understanding of crisis [ 8 ] . That warrants an overarching design goal in supporting multimodal crisis information seeking . First , this work indicated the feasibility of automatic algorithms in classifying diverse crisis visuals , which were correlated with different informational and emotional goals . It sheds light on the potential of AI - supported visual categorization to enhance crisis visual seeking . For example , the affordance of filtering based on AI - generated crisis visual categories could empower users to navigate all visuals categorized as “text images” to quickly find authoritative documents in crisis management . Besides , we suggest designers broadly leverage the natural connection of multimodal data to help users sift through crisis information . For instance , during crises with movement restrictions ( e . g . , lockdowns or natural disasters ) , the navigation of crisis visuals could largely benefit from the incorporation of geolocation information . This work revealed users’ wide adoption of in - situ photos , such as outdoor scenes of COVID - 19 test queues or supply locations , in spreading situational information . Nonetheless , other users may not easily capture such context - specific visual information under the overwhelming amount of crisis - related data [ 48 ] . In this scenario , allowing users to view the “outdoor” visual category and sort based on location proximity could empower them to easily acquire situations in the local community . Finally , we suggest designers actively situate crisis information systems within the sociocultural and sociopolitical context to propose specific interfaces for crisis communication . For example , when it is a norm to deliver authoritative guidelines along with visual authority signs in Chinese social media ( as shown in Section 4 . 3 . 1 ) , automatically identifying authority signs and affording the interface to browse relevant posts could support the seeking of authoritative crisis information . Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 8 , No . CSCW2 , Article 01 . Publication date : January 2024 . Images Connect Us Together 01 : 25 5 . 3 . 2 Implications for Crisis Information Moderation . The findings on crisis visual strategies in Section 4 . 3 indicated that crisis images were often endowed with additional roles for crisis commu - nication such as signifying authority , enhancing information , or triggering public emotions . Such visual use was typically correlated with higher public engagement indexes . These visual strategies could enhance crisis communication when properly delivered , but might also contribute to the spread of misinformation if the veracity was unchecked . Therefore , we suggest design interventions particularly pay attention to such critical visual use in crisis communication . For example , an AI - supported tool that prioritizes images with critical roles ( e . g . , images signifying authority ) in fact - checking might help capture high - risk misinformation before its wide dissemination . Also , such visual - role reminders could be embedded into before - posting nudges [ 50 ] or during - exposure warnings [ 52 ] ( e . g . , remind sharers by “This image indicates the authority of the post text . Please double - check the content” ) . 5 . 4 Technical Implications This study also revealed the limitations of current methodologies that would be valuable to note for further multimodal analysis of crisis communication . First , this work reflected how a lack of cross - cultural and in - domain datasets may bring unexpected algorithmic misinterpretations for multimodal analysis in the crisis setting . For example , deep learning models pretrained on scene - specific datasets wrongly categorized COVID - 19 lockdown checkpoints in China as ice cream parlors . Such constraints also naturally limited the generalization of more fine - grained crisis - related types through image clustering . Therefore , it warrants the development of large - scale multimodal datasets for specific crisis settings , which echoed prior work [ 4 , 48 ] . A more high - level challenge was that mainstream object - centered analytic tools ( e . g . , image classification and object detection ) may fail to unpack the nuanced roles of multimodal crisis communication . For example , recognizing an image as a “chat screenshot” might be less meaningful compared to revealing its actual goal as “evidencing challenges mentioned in the post” . Therefore , content analysis might be only the starting point in understanding multimodal crisis communication rather than the ultimate goal . On the other hand , the analytical approach employed in this study has highlighted potential avenues for conducting multimodal analyses of crisis - related data . We provide empirical evidence on the feasibility of transfer learning in understanding multimodal crisis communication , which could largely reduce the burden of manually curating labels . Also , this work integrated CV - based visual analysis and NLP - based text analysis to unpack the visual - language correlations for crisis communication . It enlightens a promising direction to adopt multimodal deep learning models [ 130 ] to process multimodal crisis data as an organic whole . 5 . 5 Limitations This work investigated the themes , goals , and strategies of social media crisis images during a COVID - 19 local outbreak , deepening the understanding of visual crisis communication in HCI and CSCW . Nonetheless , this work has the following limitations : ( 1 ) this work focuses on a COVID - 19 local outbreak in China in the aftermath of the pandemic . Therefore , some findings may not be generalized to other health crisis settings ; ( 2 ) the image clustering method managed to capture visual elements such as people and objects in crisis images , but was still limited in discerning detailed visual themes , such as topics of text image ; ( 3 ) as a secondary analysis , we did not investigate how the affected population perceived crisis images , and understanding users’ perceptions on crisis images might provide more in - depth findings of the crisis visual strategies . When multimodal crisis communication has been an increasingly prevalent practice , we call for broad investigations into different crisis communication settings to reveal the full potential of crisis imagery . As a further step , it is also of great significance for future work to propose and evaluate proof - of - concept interfaces Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 8 , No . CSCW2 , Article 01 . Publication date : January 2024 . 01 : 26 Changyang He et al . to facilitate and enhance visual crisis communication as well as maximally reduce visual - based misinformation . 6 CONCLUSION This work makes the first investigation into how crisis communication is characterized and facili - tated by social media crisis images during a COVID - 19 local outbreak . Focusing on the Xi’an local outbreak in China , we collected 345 , 423 crisis - related posts and 65 , 376 original images on a popular Chinese social media platform Weibo , and conducted a mixed - methods study to understand visual themes , goals , and strategies in crisis communication . Through an image clustering approach , we unpacked the diversity of crisis imagery with two text - embedded visual categories ( i . e . , posters and text images ) and four “visual diary” types that recorded life during the event ( e . g . , outdoor scenes during quarantine ) . We demonstrated how different visual types were leveraged to fulfill various informational and emotional communication goals , e . g . , using text - highlighted posters to signify the latest policies and embedding anxiety into visual diaries of quarantine life . Users developed strategic use of crisis images as signs of authority , visual - based information enhancement , evidence to improve credibility , and triggers for empathy . We discuss opportunities and challenges of visual crisis communication , reflect on the inter - modality correlation and complementarity , and propose design implications to facilitate effective and accurate visual crisis communication .
