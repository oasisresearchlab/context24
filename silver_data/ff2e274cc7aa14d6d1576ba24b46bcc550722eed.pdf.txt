Although extensive experimental and theoretical work has been done , the structural basis of cooperative torque generation to realize the unidirectional rotation remains elusive . We use high - speed atomic force microscopy to show that the rotor - less F 1 still “rotates” ; in the isolated α 3 β 3 stator ring , the three β subunits cyclically propagate conformational states in the counterclockwise direction , similar to the rotary shaft rotation in F 1 . The structural basis of unidirectionality is programmed in the stator ring . These findings have implications for cooperative interplay between subunits in other hexameric ATPases . 3 F 1 - ATPase , a water - soluble portion of ATP synthase ( 1 ) , is a rotary motor protein . The α 3 β 3 γ subcomplex ( referred to here as F 1 ) suffices as the motor , in which the rotor γ subunit rotates in the stator α 3 β 3 ring upon ATP hydrolysis ( 2 ) . The concept of the “rotary catalysis” of F 1 was proposed based on biochemical studies ( 3 ) . It was strongly supported by the first crystal structure ( 4 ) and directly proven by observations of rotating single molecules ( 5 ) . In F 1 , the catalytic sites are located at the α - β interfaces , mainly on the β subunits . In the crystal structure ( 4 ) , three catalytic sites are in different nucleotide - bound states ; one binds to an ATP analog ( α TP - β TP in Fig . 1E ) , another binds to ADP ( α DP - β DP ) , and the third is unbound ( α E - β E ) . Both β TP and β DP assume the closed conformation , swinging the C - terminal domain toward γ , whereas β E assumes the open conformation , swinging the domain away from γ . As these two general conformational states appear to push or be pushed by γ , respectively , it was proposed that interactions with γ control the conformational and catalytic states of individual βs to sequentially generate torque ( 6 ) . In fact , some biochemical studies are thought to suggest that the α 3 β 3 ring alone does not possess intrinsic cooperativity and γ mediates the interplay among βs ( 7 - 9 ) . This view was reinforced by studies showing that backward mechanical rotation of γ with external force reverses the chemical reaction toward ATP synthesis ( 10 , 11 ) , whereas forced forward rotation results in accelerated ATP binding ( 12 ) . 4 Recently , however , this contention has been challenged by the finding that even when most interaction sites between β and γ are abolished , F 1 retains catalytic power to rotate γ unidirectionally ( 13 , 14 ) . A few biochemical studies also suggest the intrinsic cooperativity of the α 3 β 3 ring ( 15 , 16 ) . However , as conventional single - molecule optical microscopy requires attachment of a probe onto the rotary shaft for visualization ( 5 ) , it does not allow direct examination of whether the intrinsic cooperativity in the α 3 β 3 ring is the core feature responsible for sequential torque generation . Here we clarified this issue by directly imaging the ATP - driven conformational transition of βs in the isolated α 3 β 3 ring using high - speed atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) ( 17 , 18 ) , a technique that can visualize proteins at work in real time without probes ( 19 , 20 ) . The α 3 β 3 subcomplex ( Fig . S1 , Supporting Online Materials ( SOM ) ) was covalently immobilized on a mica surface , and observed with high - speed AFM with frame capture time of 80 ms unless otherwise mentioned ( Fig . 1 , Fig . S2 , S3 ) . In the absence of nucleotide , the α 3 β 3 showed a pseudo - six - fold symmetric ring in which alternately arranged three subunits were elevated relative to the other three ( Fig . 1A , Fig . S4 ) . The simulated AFM image of the C - terminus side of the ring constructed from the crystal structure of the nucleotide - free α 3 β 3 subcomplex ( 21 ) well reproduced the observed image ( Fig . 1C ) . This indicates that the N - terminus side was selectively 5 attached to the mica , although a smaller ring corresponding to the N - terminus side was occasionally observed ( Fig . S5 ) . The three βs , which all assumed an open conformation in the crystal structure of α 3 β 3 , gave three protruding peaks in the simulated image as bright spots . When a non - hydrolyzable ATP analog AMPPNP was added , the ring became triangular and the central hole was obscured ( Fig . 1D ) . Although the three αs with lower protrusions retained the same conformation as those under the nucleotide - free condition , two of three βs retracted towards the center and simultaneously lowered their protrusions . Consequently , the ring showed a single high protrusion . A simulated image of α 3 β 3 with bound nucleotides was constructed using a structure in which γ was removed from the crystal structure of F 1 ( Fig . 1E ) ( 4 ) . The simulated image ( Fig . 1F ) also showed an asymmetric ring very similar to that of the observed image . The excellent agreement indicates that only two βs can assume the closed conformation , even in saturating AMPPNP . This feature is consistent with the observation that three βs do not assume the closed conformation simultaneously ( 22 ) . When ATP was added , β showed distinct conformational dynamics ; each β underwent a conformational transition between the outwardly extended high state ( open ) and the retracted low state ( closed ) ( Fig . 2A , Table S1 ) ; the outwardly extended and retracted conformations correlated well with the high and low protrusion states , 6 respectively ( Fig . S6 ) . The most prominent features are that only a single β assumes the open state , as in the presence of AMPPNP , and that when the open - to - closed transition occurs at one β , the opposite closed - to - open transition occurs simultaneously at its counterclockwise neighbor β in most cases . Thus the high and outwardly extended conformation propagates in the counterclockwise direction ( Fig . 2A and 2B ) . For a more quantitative analysis of this cooperativity , the conformational states of the three βs in each image frame were determined from their correlation coefficients using respective reference images of βs in the open state ( Fig . S7 , SOM ) . The correlation coefficients are distributed around two distinct peaks at ~ 0 . 995 and ~ 0 . 96 ( Fig . 2C ) . The peaks with larger and smaller coefficients correspond to the open ( O ) and closed ( C ) states , respectively . On the other hand , the correlation coefficient analysis for the nucleotide - free and AMPPNP - bound α 3 β 3 showed static conformations of β ( Fig . S8 and S9 , Table S1 ) . Fig . 2D shows typical time courses of the two conformational states for individual βs . In all images observed in the presence of 2 – 4 μM ATP ( n = 8746 ) , three βs at a given frame dominantly showed the “CCO” state ( 82 % of total ) . The COO state was also observed ( 14 . 5 % ) . Other states such as CCC ( 3 % ) and OOO ( 0 . 5 % ) were rare . We analyzed the rotary propagation of the O and C states by counting the number of counterclockwise shifts of the CCO state ( Fig . 2E , SOM ) . The propagation is 7 unidirectional , rotating counterclockwise with an efficiency of 83 % ( in 2 μM ATP ) over the total shift events examined ( n = 371 ) ( see also Fig . S10 ) . Considering that two consecutive counterclockwise shifts occurring occasionally within the frame capture time ( 80 ms ) would be counted as a clockwise shift , this value of efficiency is likely underestimated by ~ 6 % ( Fig . 3D , Fig . S11 , SOM ) . The rate of rotational propagation of the CCO state increased with increasing ATP concentration ( Fig . 3A - C ) , indicating that ATP binding is rate - limiting , consistent with the biochemically determined K m of 12 μM for ATP hydrolysis ( Fig . S1 ) . Histograms of the dwell time of the O state followed a single exponential function , and those of the C state were well fitted with the model that two consecutive events of ATP binding to the other two βs trigger the transition of the β from the C to the O state ( Fig . S11 ) . The rate constants of the counterclockwise shift of the CCO state were comparable with the initial rates of ATP hydrolysis measured biochemically ( Fig . 3D ) . Thus , each ATP hydrolysis is well coupled with the open - to - close transition of β . Just before transitioning to the next CCO state , a COO state occasionally appeared ( ~ 30 % of total transitions ) ( christcrosses in Fig . 2E , Fig . 3A - C ) . In this event , one of the two closed βs positioned at the counterclockwise side opened in most cases , implying that ADP can be released from the closed β before ATP binds to the open β ( 23 , 24 ) . 8 The present results prove that the stator α 3 β 3 ring alone possesses high cooperativity for sequential power stroking among three catalytic βs . This was also indicated by the observations that the occasional subunit dissociation completely stopped the rotary propagation of conformational state ( Fig . S12 ) . Thus , the “γ - dictator” model ( 13 ) , which proposes that only the interaction with γ determines the conformational and catalytic states of βs ( 23 , 24 ) , is not valid . On the other hand , ATP - binding rate and the efficiency of unidirectionality of the α 3 β 3 subcomplex are distinctly lower than those of F 1 ( Fig . 3 , Fig . S11 ) . Thus , the interaction with γ is dispensable but still important for the rapid and precise rotary catalysis . Our findings are not inconsistent with the observations that the rates and equilibriums of the catalytic reactions are apparently under the control of the rotary angle of γ ( 10 - 12 ) . The intrinsic interplay among βs would reinforce catalytic control by γ ; even if γ tightly interacts with only one β , it still can act on all βs through β - β interplay . These results also have implications for the cooperativity of other structurally - related hexameric ATPases such as RecA - and AAA + - family proteins in which cooperativity among the separate catalytic sites is a central issue ( 25 ) . These ATPases may also have intrinsic cooperativity . Comparative studies on these proteins should shed light on the common operating principles of hexameric ATPases . 9 REFERENCES AND NOTES 1 . P .

PS3 was expressed in E . coli , and purified using Ni 2 + - NTA affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography as described previously for purification of the α 3 β 3 γ subcomplex ( 26 ) ( Fig . S1 ) . The nucleotide - free α 3 β 3 subcomplex was stable and stored at room temperature before use . The ATP hydrolysis rate was measured with an ATP regenerating system using a UV - visible spectrophotometer ( VP - 550 , Jasco ) . Various concentrations of ATP were added to the assay mixture ( 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 250 mM KCl , 2 . 5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate , 0 . 1 mg / ml pyruvate kinase , 0 . 1 mg / ml lactate dehydrogenase , and 0 . 2 mM NADH ) at 0 s , followed by the addition of α 3 β 3 ( final 30 nM ) at 200 s . The NADH absorbance at 340 nm was monitored and the initial rate of ATP hydrolysis was calculated from the initial slope ( for 10 s after the addition of α 3 β 3 ) of the change in [ NADH ] using a molecular extinction coefficient of 6 , 220 . Measurements were carried out at 24 – 25 °C ( Fig . S1 ) . Fixation of α 3 β 3 subcomplex onto substrate for AFM observation To fix the α 3 β 3 subcomplex onto a mica substrate , we first treated the mica surface with 3 - aminopropyl - triethoxysilane ( 0 . 05 – 0 . 1 % ) for 3 min and washed the surface with pure water . The mica was then treated with glutaraldehyde ( 0 . 1 – 0 . 25 % ) for 3 min and carefully washed with buffer A ( 10 mM HEPES - NaOH ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 10 mM KCl , 5 mM MgSO 4 ) . A droplet containing the α 3 β 3 subcomplex ( 1 – 10 nM ) was deposited on the surface for 5 min , which was then washed with buffer B ( 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 2 mM MgCl 2 ) . The sample stage was mounted on the AFM head and immersed in buffer B with or without ATP or AMPPNP . AFM imaging showed that the α 3 β 3 subcomplex was strongly adsorbed on the mica surface by chemical cross - linking between the primary amine on the aminosilane - modified mica and the ε - amines of the lysine residues in the N - terminus of the β subunit . Judging from the observed images and height of the molecules ( ~ 9 nm ) , almost all molecules appeared to be adsorbed on the mica at either the C - or N - terminal side . Most ( ~ 70 % ) of the adsorbed molecules had the C - terminal side facing upward , whereas the rest had the N - terminal side facing upward . On bare and untreated mica surfaces , all molecules rapidly diffused on the surface and could not be imaged clearly . 4 High - speed AFM apparatus We used a home - built high - speed AFM apparatus ( 17 , 18 ) . The cantilevers ( Olympus ) were 6 – 7 μm long , 2 μm wide , and 90 nm thick . Their spring constant was 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 N / m , and their resonant frequency and quality factor in an aqueous solution were 0 . 7 – 1 MHz and ~ 2 , respectively . For AFM imaging , the free oscillation amplitude was ~ 1 nm and the set - point amplitude was around 90 % of the free oscillation amplitude . The tapping force estimated was less than 30 pN ( 27 ) . An amorphous carbon tip was grown on the original tip by electron beam deposition ( 28 ) . The tip length was adjusted to ~ 1 μm . The tip was sharpened by plasma etching under argon gas ( tip apex , ~ 4 nm in radius ) . AFM imaging and image processing All AFM observations were performed at room temperature ( 24 – 26 °C ) . We usually used a scan area of ~ 45 × ~ 22 nm 2 with ( 100 – 150 ) × ( 50 – 75 ) pixels . The AFM images were captured at frame rates of 10 – 12 . 5 fps . After taking images , we tracked a target molecule using two - dimensional ( 2D ) correlation analysis to compensate for the slow drift of the sample stage position in the x - and y - directions . A 3 × 3 pixel - average filter was applied to each tracked image to reduce noise . For the AFM images obtained under nucleotide - free and AMPPNP conditions in which the conformational change does not occur , frame averaging was applied before the pixel averaging ( Fig . S2 ) . The AFM images were displayed first with black - to - white color scale and then the color scale was nonlinearly assigned to the height level to highlight the top - surface structure ( Fig . S4 ) . Correlation analysis To determine the time evolution of the conformational state of each β subunit , we calculated a 2D correlation coefficient for its image in the following way . As shown in Fig . S7 , for each β we arbitrarily chose a reference frame and a region of interest ( ROI ) so that the ROI in the reference frame fully contained an open - state β subunit . The 2D correlation coefficient defined below was calculated frame - by - frame for each ROI . For images obtained in AMPPNP , we chose a closed - or open - state β subunit as the reference . The 2D correlation coefficient is defined as , Here , and are heights at pixel point in a to - be - analyzed ROI and a reference ROI of the reference frame , respectively . and are mean values of the 5 height matrices and , respectively . Measurement of cumulated number of CCO shifts As mentioned in the main text , the most populated conformational state was the CCO state , in which one β subunit is in the open ( O ) state and the other two are in the closed ( C ) state . The other conformational states ( COO , CCC , OOO ) were much less frequent and therefore considered to be unusual conformations . To reveal unidirectional propagation of the conformational states , we defined the cumulated number of the CCO shifts ( N CCO ) as follows . When the CCO state first appears in successive AFM images , N CCO is set to be 1 . Then , when the CCO state shifts counterclockwise , N CCO is increased by 1 . In contrast , when the CCO state shifts clockwise , N CCO is reduced by 1 . Here , unusual states are ignored and therefore do not affect N CCO . This counting was carried out for all consecutive frames . Measurement of cumulated rotational angle The open - state β had a higher protrusion than that of the closed - state β ( Fig . 1 ) . We obtained the pixel position that has the highest intensity in each frame ( P ) , and tracked such positions in consecutive images ( see inset of Fig . 2B ) . The averaged position of the tracked highest - intensity positions was defined as the center ( O ) . The cumulated rotational angle of the relative to the vector in the first frame was then calculated . Calculation of the degree of underestimation of unidirectionality In the experiment shown in Fig . 2 and 3 , the frame capture time ( t ) was 80 ms and the time constant ( τ ) of the open state at 2 μM ATP was 0 . 66 s ( Fig . S11 ) irrespective of counterclockwise or clockwise shift . Assuming a Poisson process , the probability ( P ( N ) ) that the shifts occur N - times within the frame capture time can be calculated by following equation . P ( N ) = ( 1 / N ! ) × ( t / τ ) N × exp ( – t / τ ) Thus , the probability of single clockwise shift within the frame capture time is ( 1 / 1 ) × ( 0 . 08 / 0 . 66 ) ×exp ( – 0 . 08 / 0 . 66 ) = 0 . 107 , and that of two consecutive counterclockwise shifts is ( 1 / 2 ) × ( 0 . 08 / 0 . 66 ) 2 ×exp ( – 0 . 08 / 0 . 66 ) = 0 . 0065 . Using these values , fraction of the two consecutive counterclockwise shifts included in the apparent single clockwise shift was estimated to be { 0 . 0065 / ( 0 . 0065 + 0 . 107 ) } ×100 = 5 . 7 % . 6 Simulation of AFM image We used software ( SPM simulator , Advanced Algorithm Systems Co . , Tokyo , Japan ) to simulate AFM images of the α 3 β 3 attached to a substrate surface at either the C - or N - terminal side . The simulation was carried out with a simple hard - sphere model . The cantilever tip was modeled as a circular cone ( apex angle , 10° ) with a small sphere ( radius , 0 . 5 – 2 nm ) at the apex . Crystal structures of the nucleotide - free α 3 β 3 subcomplex ( PDB code , 1SKY ) and nucleotide - bound α 3 β 3 γ subcomplex ( PDB code : 1BMF ) were used as the samples . For the latter case , the γ subunit was removed from the crystal structure . Each atom in the protein was modeled as a hard sphere with a corresponding van der Wars radius . We simulated AFM images using various radii for the tip - apex sphere and found that a radius of 0 . 5 nm produced the images most similar to the actual AFM images . The simulated images were processed by a low - pass filter with a cut - off wavelength of 2 nm , because the spatial resolution of the AFM image was approximately 2 nm judging from the 2D Fourier transformation of actual AFM images .

In this image , all molecules show a pseudo - six - fold symmetric ring shape in which three βs in the ring are in the open state . ( B ) An AFM image in 2 mM ATP . Because the rate of conformational change was high in this ATP concentration as compared with the 7 frame rate of observation , all molecules showed a triangle shape in which βs in the ring are almost in the closed state ( 66 % of a frame capture time ) during scanning . These results indicate that almost all of α 3 β 3 molecules behave in the same way and show different conformations depending on the presence and absence of ATP . Fig . S4 . Three dimensional illustrations of the crystal structure and AFM image in nucleotide - free condition . The α and β subunits of the crystal structure are colored in cyan and pink , respectively . The C - terminal DELSEED motif of β corresponding to the high protruding portions is highlighted in red . The color scale to display the AFM image is not linearly set for the height level . This is because the height of α 3 β 3 is about 9 nm but the height variation at the top - most surface is less than 1 nm . To highlight the top - most structure contained in the AFM image , the complete dark scale is used for the height regions from the bottom to 80 % of the highest position . Above this threshold , a linear brightness scale is used . Fig . S5 . Experimental and simulated AFM images of the N - terminal side of α 3 β 3 subcomplex ( Online movie S2 ) .
