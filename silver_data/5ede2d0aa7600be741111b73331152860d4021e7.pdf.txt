Luedtke , and Urs F . Greber 2 Supplemental Data Figure S1 : Metabolic labeling of herpes virus replication centers HSV - 1 replication centers were visualized in infected A549 cells 8 h pi . Each nucleoside ( 2 . 5 µM ) was present in the medium starting from 1 h pi . Ethynyl - modified vDNA was stained using Alexa - Fluor - 488 - azide , and samples co - stained with DAPI and anti - ICP8 antibodies . Scale bar : 10 µm . Related to Figure 3 . 3 DAPIICP8 N 3 -­Alexa-­488 Without nucleoside EdC No infection N 3 -­Alexa-­488 ICP8 ( HSV-­1 ) DAPI Merge F-­ara-­EdU EdA Figure S1 4 Figure S2 : Delivery of capsid - free vDNA from EdA / EdC - labeled HAdV - C5 into the nucleus and cytoplasm ( a ) HeLa cells were infected with EdA / EdC - HAdV - C5 for 30 or 150 min , fixed and processed for fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) . Single confocal microscopy sections across a central plane of the cells are shown . Scale bar : 10 µm . ( b ) HeLa cells were infected with EdA / EdC - HAdV - C5 for 150 min ( as described in panel c ) , processed for click chemistry labeling , stained with DAPI and Mab414 detecting nuclear pore complex antigens ( Davis and Blobel , 1987 ) , and analysed by confocal microscopy . Single mid plane sections across the nucleus were acquired with DAPI staining at 405 nm ( blue ) , mouse monoclonal antibody ( Mab ) 414 and secondary Alexa - 488 conjugated anti - mouse IgG at 488 nm ( white pseudo - colored ) , vDNA with Alexa - Fluor - 594 - azide at 561 nm ( red ) and rabbit anti - protein VII and Alexa - 633 conjugated anti - rabbit IgG at 633 nm excitation ( green pseudo - colored ) . For details , see Fig . 6 . Scale bar : 10 µm . ( c - d ) Maximal projections of confocal images , including the staining for protein VII of the same cells as in Fig . 6 . EdA / EdC - HAdV - C5 was bound to HeLa cells at cold ( MOI 30 or 75 ) , and samples were warmed for 150 min , fixed and processed for click chemistry detection of vDNA with Alexa - Fluor - 594 - azide ( red ) , immune - staining for hexon using 9C12 ( green ) and protein VII ( blue ) , imaged by confocal fluorescence microscopy and data represented as maximal projections of all the sections ( b ) . A merged image is shown in ( c ) . Scale bars = 10 µ m . ( e ) Per cell based correlations of nuclear targeted and cytoplasmic capsid - free vDNA with number of viruses . ( f ) Plot of nuclear vDNA puncta against viruses per cell with an R 2 value of 0 . 57 for 20 - 200 viruses per cell , but no apparent correlation above 200 particles per cell . A frequency analysis is shown below in blue with a fit based on log - normal distribution in red . Percentage of nuclear vDNA of total viruses per cell , including a frequency analysis is shown on the right side . 5 ( g ) Analyses of nuclear vDNA ( capsid - free puncta plus protein VII - positive puncta ) in single confocal mid - sections . EdA / EdC labeled vDNA was probed by click staining with Alexa - Fluor - 594 - azide ( white ) 150 min pi , and samples stained for hexon ( green ) , nuclei ( DAPI , blue ) and protein VII ( white ) . Image stacks were acquired across the entire nucleus . To distinguish nuclear from cytoplasmic vDNA , we analysed single sections across the center of the nucleus , in which hexon was outside the nucleus , in this case sections 6 and 7 . Note that hexon is largely outside the nucleus . White circles depict vDNA / protein VII puncta in the nucleus . Dotted white circles denote vDNA / pVII puncta that were more intense in the other optical section ( 6 or 7 ) , and were counted as nuclear in this other section . White arrowheads point to particles that were most intense in sections beyond the center of the nucleus , and hence were not considered in this analysis . Scale bar : 10 µm . Related to Figure 6 . 6 7 Supplemental Experimental Procedures Cells culture , antibodies and chemicals Human bronchial epithelial A549 cells and HeLa - ATCC ( American Type Culture Collection ) cells were grown at 37°C under 5 % CO 2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 7 . 5 % FBS and 1 % nonessential amino acids ( Gibco - BRL ) . For BSC - 40 ( African green monkey kidney ) cells DMEM was supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated FBS , glutamax , sodium pyruvate , non - essential amino acids , and penicillin - streptomycin . Mouse monoclonal antibody 9C12 against HAdV - C5 hexon was developed by L . Fayadat - Dilman and W . Olijve and obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD and maintained by The University of Iowa , Department of Biology , Iowa City , IA 52242 ( Varghese et al . , 2004 ) . Guinea pig anti - DBP was provided by W . Deppert ( Heinrich Pete Institute , Hamburg , Germany , Deppert et al . , 1988 ) . Rabbit anti - protein VII antibody was obtained from D . Engel ( University of Virginia , U . S . A . ) ( Walkiewicz et al . , 2009 ) , and the monoclonal mouse antibody against HSV ICP8 was kindly provided by R . Heilbronn ( Charité – University Medicine Berlin , Berlin , Germany ) . Mab414 developed by ( Davis and Blobel , 1987 ) was purchased from Eurogentec , Seraing , Belgium . Rabbit anti - Alexa - Fluor - 488 , goat anti - mouse IgG coupled to Alexa - Fluor - 488 , 594 or 633 and Alexa - Fluor - 488 or 594 conjugated to azide were purchased from Life Technologies ( Carlsbad , U . S . A . ) . Goat anti - mouse IgG conjugated with Abberior STAR 440SX was from Abberior GmbH ( Goettingen , Germany ) . LMB was from LC laboratories ( Woburn , U . S . A . ) , and stored in ethanol at - 20°C until use . AG was from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , U . S . A . ) . 8 Labeling of Herpes simplex virus 1 ( HSV - 1 ) with clickable nucleosides HSV - 1 - C12 is a recombinant HSV - 1 strain SC16 containing an enhanced green fluorescent protein ( eGFP ) expression cassette in the US5 ( gJ ) locus , driven by human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) IE1 promoter . The virus was originally cloned by S . Efstathiou ( University of Cambridge , Cambridge , United Kingdom ) , and working stocks kindly provided by C . Fraefel ( University of Zurich , Zurich , Switzerland ) . In situ hybridization The in situ hybridization was done essentially as previously described ( Greber et al . , 1997 ) , except that the Alexa - Fluor - 594 - labeled probe was prepared using FISH Tag TM DNA Red Kit ( Life Technologies ) , and the coverslips were inverted over 5 µ l hybridization mix containing 10 ng of the labeled probe , 50 % deionized formamide , 12 . 5 % dextran sulfate and 0 . 74 × SSC . The 42°C and 60°C washing steps were omitted . For detection of the incoming virus genome , HeLa - ATCC cells grown on glass coverslips in 24 - well dishes were incubated with EdA / EdC - HAdV - C5 ( 1 µ g ) at 37°C for 30 or 60 min , virus inoculum was removed and samples further incubated at 37°C for 0 min or 90 min before processing for in situ hybridization . For detection of the viral replication centers , A549 cells were incubated with 250 ng EdA / EdC - HAdV - C5 at 37°C for 60 min . The virus inoculum was removed and samples further incubated at 37°C for 16 h before processing for in situ hybridization . 9 Supplemental References Davis , L . I . , and Blobel , G . ( 1987 ) .
