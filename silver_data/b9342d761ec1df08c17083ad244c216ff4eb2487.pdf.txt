INTRODUCTION Dynamic force spectroscopy is widely used to investigate molecular recognition on the single - molecule level (cid:1) e . g . , re - viewed in (cid:3) 1 (cid:4)(cid:2) . From these experiments , quantitative data in terms of energy landscape parameters and kinetic constants of the interaction can be obtained (cid:3) 2 (cid:4) . The technique can be applied to a remarkable range of interactions ; from the bind - ing of complex biological molecules like antibodies (cid:3) 3 – 6 (cid:4) , proteoglycans (cid:3) 7 , 8 (cid:4) , cytochromes (cid:3) 9 (cid:4) , chaperones (cid:3) 10 (cid:4) , selec - tines (cid:3) 11 (cid:4) , protein - DNA interactions (cid:3) 12 – 14 (cid:4) to small bioor - ganic or organic compounds like peptides (cid:3) 15 (cid:4) and supramo - lecular systems (cid:3) 16 – 18 (cid:4) . The binding afﬁnities of the probed complexes can differ by several orders of magnitude . For example , the seminal early force spectroscopy works on streptavidin / avidin - biotin interactions (cid:3) 19 , 20 (cid:4) yield a disso - ciation constant K D in the range of 10 −15 M , whereas for weak calixarene - ion complexes one ﬁnds a K D of 10 −5 M (cid:3) 18 (cid:4) . Ligand - receptor interactions are mainly probed by dy - namic force spectroscopy based on atomic force microscopy (cid:1) AFM (cid:2) , but also alternative techniques like the biomembrane force probe (cid:3) 2 , 21 (cid:4) or optical tweezers (cid:3) 22 (cid:4) are available . A typical experimental setup is sketched in Fig . 1 . One binding partner is connected to the force transducer (cid:1) i . e . , the tip of a soft AFM cantilever (cid:2) and the other is bound to a surface . The ligand , the receptor - molecules , or both , are usually linked via polymeric tethers to the tip and to the surface , respectively (cid:3) 3 , 5 , 12 , 15 , 23 (cid:4) . In order to obtain force - distance curves , the AFM tip or the surface is cycled up and down while mea - suring the force acting on the cantilever . From these force curves rupture or unbinding forces are analyzed for various pulling velocities . The interpretation and theoretical modeling of these ex - periments is challenging , as shown in various publications (cid:3) 24 – 27 (cid:4) . Starting with the original works of Bell (cid:3) 28 (cid:4) and Evans and Ritchie (cid:3) 29 (cid:4) , almost all theoretical models rely on the assumption of a well - deﬁned force - extension character - istic of all the involved elastic components of the experimen - tal setup , which is independent of the velocity at which the pulling force increases and in particular does not change upon many repetitions of the same experiment . Since disper - sive linker lengths , nonorthogonal pulling geometries , or partly mis - or unfolded binding partners can contribute to systemic spreads in force - extension characteristics , the main purpose of our present paper is a careful reconsideration of the above - mentioned basic assumption by analyzing the force - extension curves of speciﬁc protein - DNA interactions in the ﬁeld of prokaryotic transcriptional regulation (cid:3) 30 (cid:4) .

This results in a data analysis technique for dynamic force spectroscopy on single ligand - receptor complexes . II . THEORETICAL BACKGROUND In this section we brieﬂy summarize the main theoretical framework relevant for our subsequent discussions . Nearly all theoretical models for bond rupture are based on the seminal works of Bell , Evans , and Ritchie (cid:3) 28 , 29 (cid:4) . Within this approach , a forced bond rupture is viewed as a thermally activated decay of a single slow reaction coordinate over a potential barrier . Let f (cid:1) t (cid:2) denote the force that acts on the bond at time t . Since it is increasing much slower than all relevant molecu - lar relaxation processes , the reaction kinetics can be very well approximated by n˙ (cid:1) t (cid:2) = − k „ f (cid:1) t (cid:2) … n (cid:1) t (cid:2) , (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) where n (cid:1) t (cid:2) denotes the survival probability of the bond up to time t and k (cid:1) f (cid:2) the dissociation rate at an arbitrary but ﬁxed force f . A further key assumption is that the instantaneous force f (cid:1) t (cid:2) depends solely on the total instantaneous extension s = s (cid:1) t (cid:2) of all elastic components of the complex (cid:1) cantilever , linker , receptor , and ligand (cid:2) . In other words , there exists a common function F (cid:1) s (cid:2) (cid:1) later referred to as the master curve (cid:2) such that f (cid:1) t (cid:2) = F „ s (cid:1) t (cid:2) … (cid:1) 2 (cid:2) for all the pulling experiments under consideration , indepen - dently of any further details (cid:1) pulling speed , linker properties , etc . (cid:2) of the single repetitions of the experiment . Finally , we restrict ourselves to the usual case that the surface is retracted at constant velocity v , i . e . , s (cid:1) t (cid:2) = v t , (cid:1) 3 (cid:2) and without loss of generality we choose the time offset such that t = 0 when pulling starts . Hence it can be assumed that f (cid:1) t (cid:2) is a continuous and monotonically increasing function of time . Then Eq . (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) can be expressed in terms of the force with formal solution n (cid:1) f (cid:2) = n v (cid:1) f (cid:2) = exp (cid:5) − 1 v (cid:6) f min f df (cid:1) k (cid:1) f (cid:1) (cid:2) F (cid:1) „ F −1 (cid:1) f (cid:1) (cid:2) … (cid:7) (cid:1) 4 (cid:2) for f (cid:2) f min , where f min denotes the threshold value of the force below which the measurement is dominated by random ﬂuctuations and artifacts so that rupture events cannot be detected in this regime (cid:1) see Sec . III A (cid:2) . The subscript v re - fers to the velocity dependence of the survival probability . In order to extract any useful and interesting quantitative information from the measurement , further assumptions about the force dependence of the dissociation rate k (cid:1) f (cid:2) have to be made . A quite common approximation going back to Bell (cid:3) 28 (cid:4) is k (cid:1) f (cid:2) = k 0 exp (cid:5) x (cid:3) f k B T (cid:7) , (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) with k 0 the dissociation rate in the absence of an external force , x (cid:3) the distance between potential well and barrier , and k B T the thermal energy . In the following we refer to the model relying on Eqs . (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) – (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) as the standard or Bell model . Generalizations of this approximation have recently attracted considerable interest (cid:3) 31 – 33 (cid:4) . As can be seen from Eq . (cid:1) 4 (cid:2) , specifying the force depen - dence of the rate k (cid:1) f (cid:2) alone is not sufﬁcient for analyzing the data : Also the full force - extension characteristic F (cid:1) s (cid:2) includ - ing the threshold value f min is required . It should be re - marked that there exist a number of different models describ - ing the mechanical response of idealized polymeric chains in terms of microscopic parameters like contour and Kuhn length (cid:1) e . g . , the freely jointed chain or the wormlike chain model , as reviewed , e . g . , in (cid:3) 34 (cid:4)(cid:2) . Since the total elastic en - tity is composed of cantilever , linkers , and ligand - receptor molecules , no simple realistic model exists to describe the relevant force - extension curve F (cid:1) s (cid:2) . In the following we therefore just assume that an appropriate approximation for F (cid:1) s (cid:2) is available from experimental data . Given the survival probability n v (cid:1) f (cid:2) , the probability den - sity to observe a rupture event is p (cid:1)(cid:8) f (cid:8) (cid:4) (cid:1) , v , F , f min (cid:2) = − d df n v (cid:1) f (cid:2) , (cid:1) 6 (cid:2) where the notation in terms of a conditional probability p (cid:1)(cid:8) f (cid:8) ¯ (cid:2) refers to the fact that this density is also conditioned on the model parameters (cid:4) (cid:1) (cid:3) e . g . , in the Bell model (cid:4) (cid:1) = (cid:1) x (cid:3) , k 0 (cid:2)(cid:4) , the pulling velocity v , the full force - extension curve , and the force offset f min . Under the above discussed assumption that F (cid:1) s (cid:2) in Eq . (cid:1) 2 (cid:2) is the same function in all rupture measurements , a direct consequence of Eq . (cid:1) 4 (cid:2) is that − v ln ( n v (cid:1) f (cid:2) ) is independent of the pulling velocity (cid:3) 35 (cid:4) . For a large number of experimental data sets this has been demon - strated not to be the case (cid:3) 26 (cid:4) . In particular the distributions of measured rupture forces are much broader than those pre - dicted by the standard model . A possible explanation for this discrepancy is given in (cid:3) 27 (cid:4) , consisting of a heterogeneous bond model such that Eqs . (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) – (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) are still valid except that due to uncontrollable variations of the molecular complex or of the local environment of the bond , the parameter x (cid:3) is itself subjected to random variations . Sampling this param - eter from a Gaussian distribution with mean x¯ (cid:3) and variance (cid:5) x 2 results in a good agreement with the analyzed data sets . The heterogeneous bond model thus involves the three pa - rameters (cid:4) (cid:1) = (cid:1) x¯ (cid:3) , (cid:5) x , k 0 (cid:2) . Note that the standard model is a special case of the heterogeneous bond model corresponding to (cid:5) x = 0 , while the qualitative and quantitative differences between the two models become more and more pronounced with increasing variance (cid:5) x . III . DATA ANALYSIS A dynamic force spectroscopy experiment consists typi - cally of thousands of force - distance curves . This requires a FUHRMANN et al . PHYSICAL REVIEW E 77 , 031912 (cid:1) 2008 (cid:2) 031912 - 2 stable procedure to detect and process extended data sets . We developed MATLAB (cid:1) Mathworks (cid:2) based routines for the analysis of force - distance curves , which automatically detect , categorize , and quantify rupture events . In the following sec - tions we motivate and develop step by step this procedure of processing and evaluating experimental single - molecule force spectroscopy data . A . Raw data analysis A raw data force - extension curve measured by the AFM for one rupture experiment is shown in Fig . 2 , adopting the standard convention to plot on the abscissa the piezoposition (cid:1) increasingly negative as time goes on (cid:2) and on the ordinate the force acting on the cantilever , being positive if the can - tilever in Fig . 1 is bent upward with respect to its rest posi - tion and negative for downward bending . Our ﬁrst step of processing the raw data is to ﬁt the sensor response (cid:1) dotted magenta straight line (cid:2) and the reference baseline (cid:1) solid green straight line : the cantilever is far away from the surface and the complex unbound , hence the only remaining forces are thermal ﬂuctuations ; the dotted green straight line represents the extrapolation of the observed baseline (cid:2) . Their intersection point is denoted by r 0 and can be identiﬁed with the moment at which the cantilever leaves the sample surface . We remark that in the measured force - distance curves the slope of the reference baseline can be slightly different from zero (cid:1) e . g . , due to thermal drift effects (cid:2) , and the zero values for both the raw force and the raw dis - placement data can be chosen arbitrarily . Therefore all forces will at some later stage be converted such that they represent the (cid:1) positive (cid:2) distance between the measured raw force and the reference baseline . The next task is to identify discontinuities in the force - distance curves . An example is shown in Fig . 2 where the measured force value makes a large jump at point r 2 . Clearly , such discontinuities are candidates for possible rupture events of the actual molecular bond of interest . If more than one discontinuity is found , only the last one is a potential candidate (cid:1) inset of Fig . 2 (cid:2) , while the preceding discontinui - ties must be disregarded as being caused by rupture of one out of several coexisting bonds . As outlined in the previous section , an appropriate param - etrization of the force - extension curve before rupture is re - quired . We found that for our examined systems straight lines are not appropriate but that second degree polynomials are satisfactory for the parametrization within the whole rel - evant range of loading forces between r 2 and r 1 in Fig . 2 . However , the point r 1 , where the complex actually begins to be stretched , is not known a priori and has to be determined self - consistently together with the ﬁtting procedure of the force - extension curve . To accomplish this task several points have to be considered . First , repulsive forces acting on the AFM tip can only be caused by noise or interactions between tip and surface . In both cases the corresponding force does not act on the bond (cid:1) the complex of linkers , ligand mol - ecules , and receptor molecules is not stretched (cid:2) . Conse - quently , these forces do not inﬂuence the lifetime of the bond and the concomitant part of the force - extension curve with positive forces is of no further interest . Second , the force has to be a monotonically increasing function of the extension of the complex which is expected to become stiffer upon being stretched (cid:1) i . e . , the second derivative of the curve in Fig . 2 has to be negative (cid:2) . Finally , discontinuities can only be ex - plained by rupture events or adhesion effects . Hence there should be no discontinuity in the interval (cid:3) r 2 , r 1 (cid:4) . The main idea of our procedure is to iteratively determine the point r 1 . In every step the force - extension curve is ﬁtted by a second degree polynomial and it is checked whether the FIG . 2 . (cid:1) Color (cid:2) Typical force - distance curve (cid:1) only the so - called retracting part of the complete force - distance cycle is shown ; direc - tion of pulling from right to left , indicated by the two large arrows (cid:2) . Left of the point r 2 , the connection between cantilever and surface has broken and the measured signal is caused by thermal ﬂuctua - tions . Fitting this part of the curve with a straight line yields the “baseline” (cid:1) solid green ; extrapolated as dotted green line (cid:2) which sets the force offset . Its intersection with the extrapolated dotted magenta line (cid:1) “sensor response , ” ﬁtted by a straight line (cid:2) at r 0 de - ﬁnes the point where the cantilever leaves the surface . Between r 0 and r 1 the measured force is caused by adhesion , thermal ﬂuctua - tions , and unspeciﬁc interactions . From (cid:1) approximately (cid:2) r 1 on , the complex composed of a cantilever , linker , and the ligand - receptor molecules is stretched until the bond breaks at r 2 . The part of the rupture curve between r 1 and r 2 is called the force - extension char - acteristic or loading and can be ﬁtted by a second degree polyno - mial (cid:1) solid red curve (cid:2) . The slope of this polynomial at extension r 2 is called stiffness and the corresponding difference between the ﬁt - ted red curve and the green baseline at r 2 is deﬁned as the rupture force (cid:1) or dissociation force ; indicated as a vertical arrow (cid:2) . The gray solid line is a copy of the green line shifted downwards . The (cid:1) posi - tive (cid:2) distance between the green and gray lines is denoted as force threshold f min . For the purpose of identifying rupture events , only force values beyond this threshold are taken into account . Inset : Example of a force - distance curve for which no rupture event would be accepted for further analysis for the following reasons : The discontinuity at point r 2 is neither the last discontinuity in the force distance cycle nor does the cantilever immediately “jump back” to the green baseline . The observed event at point r 4 might correspond to the rupture of a single bond , but the corresponding red force - distance curve exceeds the threshold f min from the very beginning . REFINED PROCEDURE OF EVALUATING EXPERIMENTAL … PHYSICAL REVIEW E 77 , 031912 (cid:1) 2008 (cid:2) 031912 - 3 above - mentioned points are satisﬁed . In detail , our algorithm works as follows : (cid:1) i (cid:2) r 1 is chosen only slightly larger than r 2 ; (cid:1) ii (cid:2) a second degree polynomial is ﬁtted to the raw data in the interval (cid:3) r 2 , r 1 (cid:4) ; and (cid:1) iii (cid:2) it is checked whether the ﬁtted poly - nomial meets one of the following conditions within the in - terval (cid:3) r 2 , r 1 (cid:4) : (cid:1) a (cid:2) it crosses the reference baseline ; (cid:1) b (cid:2) it ex - hibits a maximum ; (cid:1) c (cid:2) it has the “wrong” curvature as compared to the red line in Fig . 2 , i . e . , its second derivative is positive ; and (cid:1) d (cid:2) another discontinuity has been detected in this interval . If none of the conditions are fulﬁlled , r 1 is increased by a small value (cid:6) r and steps (cid:1) ii (cid:2) and (cid:1) iii (cid:2) are repeated . Otherwise , r 1 is decreased by (cid:6) r and the resulting ﬁnal r 1 value is deﬁned as the position where the complex begins to be stretched . The corresponding ﬁnal polynomial ﬁt is chosen for the parametrization of the force - extension curve and the rupture force f i is deﬁned as the difference between this ﬁt and the reference baseline at r 2 (cid:1) see Fig . 2 (cid:2) . In this way noise effects that especially dominate the mea - surement in the low - force regime can be reduced to a mini - mum . In practice , we found that an additional discontinuity (cid:3) condition (cid:1) d (cid:2)(cid:4) in fact always implies a maximum (cid:3) condition (cid:1) b (cid:2)(cid:4) of the ﬁtted polynomial . The force value at the beginning of the ﬁt (cid:1) at r = r 1 (cid:2) is the (cid:1) force (cid:2) offset for this single rupture curve . Most ﬁts do not reach the zero force baseline for basically two reasons . First , due to a limited resolution of the apparatus and unspeciﬁc interactions between tip and surface , we cannot measure ar - bitrarily small forces . Second , as discussed above we only use the last rupture event in each force - distance cycle . How - ever , in case that there are multiple rupture events in the cycle , it is likely that the cantilever does not “jump back” to the baseline after the second to last bond has ruptured (cid:1) see inset of Fig . 2 (cid:2) . We therefore introduce a threshold parallel to the baseline but at a distance f min below it (cid:1) see also Fig . 2 (cid:2) . Note that by convention f min is always positive like the rup - ture force . For a quantitative evaluation of the experiment it is required (cid:3) see Eqs . (cid:1) 4 (cid:2) and (cid:1) 6 (cid:2)(cid:4) that the bond has been formed at forces lower than this threshold value f min and that all rupture events with rupture forces larger than this thresh - old value can be detected , i . e . , f min must in particular be larger than the thermal ﬂuctuations . That means we only ac - cept rupture events with the properties that the polynomial ﬁt crosses the threshold between r 2 and r 1 before jumping back to the baseline at r 2 . Consequently , when choosing f min too small a lot of rupture events will not be accepted because the corresponding force value at the beginning of the pulling (cid:1) at r = r 1 (cid:2) is already larger than the threshold force . On the other hand , when choosing f min too large also a lot of rupture events will not be accepted because the rupture force is smaller than f min . Hence we usually choose this value such that as many rupture events as possible can be used for the evaluation of the experiment . In our experiment we found that noise effects increase with the pulling velocity . There - fore we generally admit that the offset f min still depends on the pulling velocity , i . e . , f min = f min (cid:1) v (cid:2) . Other technical problems , when automatically processing the force - distance curves , are caused by adhesion effects . Near the sample surface , adhesion forces act on the cantile - ver which can cause a signal in the force - extension curve (cid:1) cf . Fig . 2 left of point r 0 (cid:2) . Most successful single - molecule force spectroscopy experiments use polymeric linkers of a deﬁned length to connect the binding partners to the tip and the surface , respectively . This allows limiting the forced rupture events of interest to a distinct distance window (cid:3) 37 (cid:4) . Hence we use the distance from r 0 to r 1 as another selection crite - rion and exclude rupture events with small (cid:8) r 1 − r 0 (cid:8) from fur - ther analysis . B . Construction of the force - extension master curve One of the basic theoretical assumptions (cid:1) see Sec . II (cid:2) is a well - deﬁned force - extension characteristic which , in particu - lar , is independent of the pulling velocity and does not change upon repeating the experiment many times . In this section we show that this assumption does often not apply to the experimental reality and present a numerical scheme to remedy this discrepancy . Experimental ﬁnding . In agreement with Ref . (cid:3) 38 (cid:4) , we found that the second order polynomial ﬁts resulting from the above described selection and ﬁtting procedure do not give rise to a unique force - extension curve . This can easily be seen by considering the data pairs (cid:1) f i , f i (cid:1) (cid:2) with f i a rupture force and f i (cid:1) the slope of the corresponding polynomial at the point of rupture . Binning these data (cid:1) f i , f i (cid:1) (cid:2) in a two - dimensional (cid:1) 2D (cid:2) histogram , gives rise to a different kind of plot , featuring stiffness against force . A representative ex - ample of such a stiffness versus force plot is given in Fig . 3 . If the assumption of a well - deﬁned force - extension charac - teristic were correct , all points (cid:1) f i , f i (cid:1) (cid:2) should lie on a single curve (cid:1) depending on the whole complex of linkers , ligand , and receptor molecules and the cantilever (cid:2) apart from a slight broadening due to remnant noise effects . This assumption is thus incompatible with the experimental ﬁndings depicted in Fig . 3 . Main idea . Our main idea to remedy this discrepancy be - tween theoretical prerequisite and experimental data is to in - troduce a further selection procedure with the very purpose that at the end only force - extension curves remain which all are very close to one single “master curve . ” In order to do this we have to focus on two points . First , the number of ﬁnally remaining force - extension curves should be as large as possible . Second , the master curve has to be characteristic for “typical” rupture events . We now describe our general procedure . Construction of the master curve . In a ﬁrst step we con - sider for one pulling velocity all rupture events (cid:1) f i , f i (cid:1) (cid:2) in a region f i (cid:2) (cid:3) f c − (cid:6) F / 2 ; f c + (cid:6) F / 2 (cid:4) , (cid:1) 7 (cid:2) f i (cid:1) (cid:2) (cid:3) f c (cid:1) − (cid:6) S / 2 ; f c (cid:1) + (cid:6) S / 2 (cid:4) (cid:1) 8 (cid:2) with f c a typical rupture force and f c (cid:1) a typical stiffness . In practice (cid:1) f c , f c (cid:1) (cid:2) is usually the position of the maximum in Fig . 3 . Furthermore , the two interval widths (cid:6) F , (cid:6) S are cho - sen so that a “sufﬁcient” number of points lie within the selected parameter windows . To exclude a possible contami - nation with double rupture events and obvious outliers , one can visibly inspect the corresponding force - extension curves and if necessary readjust the parameters . FUHRMANN et al . PHYSICAL REVIEW E 77 , 031912 (cid:1) 2008 (cid:2) 031912 - 4 After applying the above selection procedure , the remain - ing force - extension curves are automatically aligned by properly transforming abscissa and ordinate in Fig . 2 as fol - lows : In a ﬁrst step , the data are transformed such that the green reference baseline in Fig . 2 falls on top of the zero force line . Then the abscissa is shifted such that every ad - justed force - extension curve crosses the gray threshold line at the same position r = 0 , see Fig . 4 (cid:1) b (cid:2) . Finally , this data set is used for a second degree polynomial ﬁt , henceforth called the (cid:1) force - extension (cid:2) master curve and exempliﬁed by the red line in Fig . 4 (cid:1) b (cid:2) . Selection procedure . In a second step all force - extension curves for all pulling velocities are compared with this mas - ter curve . The decision of which curves are accepted for the further analysis is controlled by two parameters (cid:1) (cid:7) 1 , (cid:7) 2 (cid:2) . The ﬁrst of them sets the maximum relative deviation of the slope at the rupture point from the slope of the master curve at this point . The second deﬁnes an interval around the master curve , limiting the maximum relative deviation from the master curve as indicated by the green lines in Fig . 4 (cid:1) b (cid:2) . Only force - extension curves lying entirely in this interval will be accepted . In the previous section we have described the necessity to introduce a threshold force f min and to use only rupture events for the evaluation where the bond has formed below this force , but with rupture force f i (cid:2) f min . However , it seems desirable that the master curve should also correctly describe the part of the force - extension curve for lower forces . Hence for the construction of the master curve , i . e . , for choosing the subset of rupture forces out of which the master curve is constructed , a lower threshold force f ˜ min (cid:8) f min should be used sooner than later for the quantitative evaluation of the experiment . It should be noted that the parameters (cid:1) (cid:7) 1 , (cid:7) 2 (cid:2) control how similar the force - extension curves of the accepted rupture events are . Ideally , one would wish to choose both as small as possible . However , the smaller they are , the lower is the number of accepted rupture events and , hence , the worse the statistic . Therefore one has to make a compromise between these two points . In contrast to the choice of (cid:1) (cid:7) 1 , (cid:7) 2 (cid:2) the choice of the interval widths (cid:6) F and (cid:6) S in Eqs . (cid:1) 7 (cid:2) and (cid:1) 8 (cid:2) is rather uncritical as they only determine the number of events used to construct the master curve . The detailed dis - cussion of the explicit choice of the “ﬁltering parameters” for a particular experiment will be given in Sec . IV . A subtle point arising with the above selection of force - extension curves regards the question whether such a “ﬁlter - ing procedure” is not introducing certain hidden modiﬁca - FIG . 3 .

For example , the “long” force - extension segments , corresponding to large rupture forces , could have an over - or under - proportional probability to be eliminated , compared to the “short” ones . By compar - ing rupture force distributions for different ﬁltering param - eters , we will show in Sec . IV that such problems are appar - ently not very signiﬁcant . C . Further analysis of dynamic force spectroscopy data sets The result of the so far data analysis is a set of rupture forces f (cid:1) = (cid:1) f 1 , . . . , f N (cid:2) measured at pulling velocities v (cid:1) = (cid:1) v 1 , . . . , v N (cid:2) with corresponding force offsets f (cid:1) min = (cid:3) f min (cid:1) v 1 (cid:2) , . . . , f min (cid:1) v N (cid:2)(cid:4) . We recall that the threshold f min de - pends only on the pulling velocity and not on the actually measured rupture force , i . e . , two rupture forces measured at the same pulling velocity have the same value for f min . For all these rupture measurements the force - extension curves follow a pathway close to a master curve as exempliﬁed by Fig . 4 (cid:1) b (cid:2) . To establish the connection with the theoretical descrip - tion in Sec . II , one ﬁrst of all has to invert the negative signs of both the extensions and the forces into their positive coun - terparts , resulting in the theoretical master curve F (cid:1) s (cid:2) . The next step is to estimate the model parameters (cid:4) (cid:1) = (cid:1) x¯ (cid:3) , (cid:5) x , k 0 (cid:2) of the heterogeneous bond model . To this end we adopted a maximum likelihood procedure . Accordingly , the most probable parameters (cid:4) (cid:1) (cid:1) are those that maximize the likelihood function ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) FIG . 4 .

(cid:1) 9 (cid:2) In doing so , it has been taken for granted that all force - extension curves follow exactly the master curve . This seems justiﬁed in view of the selection procedure described in the preceding section such that the actual deviations of the re - maining force - extension curves from the master curve are very small . For a more detailed discussion of the adopted maximum likelihood procedure we refer to (cid:3) 36 (cid:4) . Here , we only point out that for estimating the parameters , no binning of the rupture forces to histograms is needed . The histograms are only used to compare the ﬁtted distribution with the ex - perimentally measured one . A further advantage is that esti - mates for the statistical error are easily obtained . The most probable parameters (cid:4) (cid:1) (cid:1) are found by maximizing the likeli - hood function numerically . For practical purposes we have used (cid:9) = ln (cid:1) k 0 (cid:2) as a ﬁt parameter . Using k 0 itself would result in the same estimate k 0 (cid:1) for the parameter but the correspond - ing error interval is not symmetrically around the most prob - able value . For the data presented in this work a commercial algorithm from the NAG (cid:1) National Algorithms Group (cid:2) li - brary has been used for the maximization . D . Software integration The entire above described procedure for dynamic force spectroscopy data analysis is developed in MATLAB (cid:1) Math - works (cid:2) and C programming language . Most functions of the program can be handled via a graphical user interface (cid:1) GUI (cid:2) enabling one to do a data analysis with a scan rate of about 200 force distance curves per minute with a standard PC . This force spectroscopy software can analyze both the data format of our homebuilt force spectroscopy instruments (cid:3) 12 (cid:4) and the data provided by the commercial MFP - 3D (cid:1) Asylum Research , USA (cid:2) . IV . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In order to test and illustrate our data analysis method , the raw data originally published in (cid:3) 30 (cid:4) have been taken . The experiment conducted involved speciﬁc protein - DNA inter - actions relevant for prokaryotic transcriptional regulation . These interactions are mediated by small signaling molecules (cid:1) N - acyl homoserine lactones , AHL (cid:2) , which are able to stimu - late the protein - DNA binding by docking onto the proteins . In this particular experiment , the DNA target sequence is located on a 285 bp long DNA fragment , which is immobi - lized on the tip via an approximately 35 nm long poly (cid:1) eth - ylene glycol (cid:2) - linker , see also Fig . 1 . The proteins are immo - bilized on mica surfaces via short linker molecules and stimulated by the AHL N - decanoyl - DL - homoserine lactone (cid:1) C10 - HL (cid:2) . Each force - extension curve could be well - approximated by a second degree polynomial (cid:1) for a particular example see Fig . 2 (cid:2) , but no universal force - distance curve , neither for a speciﬁc pulling velocity , nor for the entire data set could be found , in disagreement with the theoretical model . Qualita - tively this can be seen in Fig . 3 , where the plot shows a broad single maximum with a signiﬁcant number of outliers . To quantify this ﬁnding , we choose the subset of force - extension curves corresponding to rupture forces between 60 and 80 pN . For this subset , Fig . 4 (cid:1) a (cid:2) shows the histogram of the slope (cid:1) stiffness (cid:2) of the ﬁtted polynomials at the point of rupture . It has a pronounced maximum at 4 . 5 pN / nm but also a dispersion which cannot be neglected . Possible explana - tions are a dispersion of linker length (cid:3) 25 (cid:4) or that in some cases not single but multiple bonds are stretched . In the latter case , the corresponding complex is stiffer . Another possible reason is that the angle between the stretched complex and the surface normal is in most cases not zero (cid:3) 37 (cid:4) . As different angles yield different force - extension curves , variations of the pulling geometry might also explain our ﬁndings . To account for the problem that no universal force - extension curve exists , a master curve can be constructed and only rupture events with a force - extension characteristic close to this curve are accepted for further analysis . For the construction of the master curve a subset of rupture events is chosen and a second degree polynomial is ﬁtted to the cor - responding force - extension curves . A fully objective criterion which subset should be chosen for this construction does not exist . However , as discussed in Sec . III B the master curve should be characteristic for typical rupture events . Therefore we have used the rupture curves corresponding to the peak of the 2D histogram in Fig . 3 . The corresponding pulling veloc - ity is v = 5000 nm / s being the highest pulling velocity used in (cid:3) 30 (cid:4) . The reason for considering just the largest v is sim - ply that the rupture force increases with the pulling velocity . Hence the constructed master curve should be more appro - priate for describing the force - extension characteristic in the high force regime than the corresponding curve constructed from rupture curves sampled at lower pulling velocities . Analogously , for an appropriate parametrization of the force - extension characteristic in the low - force regime it is desir - able that the force - extension curves used to construct the master curve start well below the threshold force f min which had to be introduced for a quantitative evaluation of the ex - periment (cid:1) see Sec . III B (cid:2) . We have , thus , temporarily used a lower threshold f˜ min for this construction than later in the quantitative evaluation . In particular a threshold of 10 pN results in a very low number of force curves (cid:1) 10 – 20 (cid:2) which are then used for the construction . The red line in Fig . 4 (cid:1) b (cid:2) shows the constructed master curve together with the force - extension curves of various single measurements which are used for a quantitative evaluation of the experiment . All these rupture curves lie within a preset level of deviation . Thus all rupture events that are used for further analysis have approximately the same force - extension pathway . Since it is very unlikely that a multiple and a single bond have the same force - extension curve , it follows that a contamination of the rupture force data by multiple - rupture events is reduced to a minimum . In order to examine whether the constructed mas - ter curve strongly depends on the selected subset of rupture forces , we have varied the selected area in the 2D histogram . As long as this area is near the peak , the constructed master curves were always similar . We have also compared the re - sulting master curve with constructed master curves from other pulling velocities , but no systematic deviations could be found . REFINED PROCEDURE OF EVALUATING EXPERIMENTAL … PHYSICAL REVIEW E 77 , 031912 (cid:1) 2008 (cid:2) 031912 - 7 In a next step , we have applied the ﬁltering procedure for different choices of the tolerance levels (cid:1) (cid:7) 1 , (cid:7) 2 (cid:2) . Our general observation is that with decreasing tolerance levels the width of the histogram of rupture forces initially decreases slightly . From a certain point on , however , the width is constant and the only effect of further lowering (cid:1) (cid:7) 1 , (cid:7) 2 (cid:2) is that the number of accepted rupture events gets smaller . For the particular choice (cid:1) (cid:7) 1 = 0 . 2 , (cid:7) 2 = 0 . 12 (cid:2) the result of this ﬁltering proce - dure is shown in Figs . 4 (cid:1) c (cid:2) and 4 (cid:1) d (cid:2) where the histograms of rupture forces before and after the ﬁltering procedure are presented for one particular pulling velocity . Within their in - trinsic statistical uncertainties , these histograms differ from each other only slightly . The same was found for all other pulling velocities and analyzed data sets . Even going to smaller tolerance levels (cid:1) (cid:7) 1 , (cid:7) 2 (cid:2) does not change this ﬁnding , implying that the distribution of rupture forces does not criti - cally depend on details of the force - extension characteristic . Moreover , it follows that the ﬁltering procedure itself does not introduce signiﬁcant artifacts into the rupture force sta - tistics . Having ensured that the theoretical assumption of a unique force - extension characteristic is met at least for the considered subset of data , we can now check whether any model relying on Eqs . (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) – (cid:1) 3 (cid:2) is compatible to the experi - mental data . Given N v rupture forces f i , i = 1 , . . . , N v , mea - sured at a pulling velocity v , the survival probability of the bond can be approximated as n˜ v (cid:1) f (cid:2) = N v −1 (cid:10) i = 1 N v (cid:10) (cid:1) f i − f (cid:2) with the Heaviside step function (cid:10) (cid:1) · (cid:2) . As discussed in Sec . II , a direct consequence of Eqs . (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) – (cid:1) 4 (cid:2) is that − v ln ( n v (cid:1) f (cid:2) ) is in - dependent of the pulling velocity (cid:1) for a velocity independent threshold force f min (cid:2) . Figure 5 shows that this is deﬁnitively not the case for our experimental data set from (cid:3) 30 (cid:4) . Hence neither the standard Bell model (cid:3) 29 (cid:4) nor any of its extensions (cid:3) 31 – 33 (cid:4) can explain the experimental ﬁndings . On the other hand , the heterogeneous bond model has previously shown to be able to explain the splitting of the − v ln ( n v (cid:1) f (cid:2) ) curves . A maximum likelihood ﬁt (cid:3) 36 (cid:4) for this model yields the most probable parameters k 0 (cid:1) = 0 . 02 s −1 (cid:3) ln (cid:1) k 0 (cid:1) (cid:11) 1 s (cid:2) = −3 . 86 (cid:12) 1 . 55 (cid:4) , x¯ (cid:3) (cid:1) = 0 . 6 (cid:12) 0 . 1 nm , and (cid:5) x (cid:1) = 0 . 23 (cid:12) 0 . 04 nm . For these parameters the heterogeneous bond model predicts approximately the same dependence of − v ln ( n v (cid:1) f (cid:2) ) on the pulling velocity as experimentally mea - sured (cid:1) Fig . 5 (cid:2) . Finally in Fig . 6 the theoretical distributions are compared to the histograms of rupture forces measured at various pulling velocities . For all these velocities the theo - retically predicted distribution is very similar to the experi - mentally measured one . Hence we can conclude that the het - erogeneous bond model is able to explain the experimental ﬁndings . The evaluation of the data without any ﬁltering procedure and in the framework of the standard Bell model yielded the estimates for the model parameters : k 0 = 1 . 43 (cid:12) 0 . 45 s −1 and x (cid:3) = 0 . 52 (cid:12) 0 . 03 nm (cid:3) 30 (cid:4) . It should be noted that for this evaluation only the dependence of the most probable rupture force on the pulling velocity has been used .

This clearly demon - strates the importance of consistent data analysis standards for extracting quantitative and comprehensive molecular data in a robust and independent manner . Assuming that the Bell model with these parameters is true , the distribution of rup - ture forces for the force - extension master curve and given force offsets can be calculated via Eqs . (cid:1) 4 (cid:2) – (cid:1) 6 (cid:2) . Figure 6 shows clearly that these “expected” distributions explain the experimental ﬁndings only unsatisfactorily for all pulling ve - locities in agreement with our above conclusions . V . SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a data analysis method in the ﬁeld of dynamic force spectroscopy on single ligand - receptor pairs . This method allows the careful processing and analysis of the force - distance characteristic in an automated manner . We have paid particular attention to guarantee that the assumptions made for the theoretical interpretation and evaluation of the experiment are really satisﬁed . A common basic assumption in the context of theoreti - cally interpreting and quantitatively evaluating single - molecule force spectroscopy experiments is that the force - extension characteristic of the considered molecular complex (cid:1) including ligand , receptor , linkers , AFM , etc . (cid:2) is always the same , i . e . , it does not change from one pulling experiment to the next and does not depend on the pulling velocity . Here we have demonstrated by means of data from a representa - tive experiment that this assumption is in fact not satisﬁed . In the absence of previously existing careful examinations of this assumption , we must conclude that similar discrepancies between theoretical models and experimental reality may be quite common and may require reconsideration of the experi - mental data and the hence deduced quantitative conclusions . In a next step , we have put forward a selection procedure of rupture events such that this initial discrepancy between theory and experiment is remedied by construction . Yet , we found that this amendment is not sufﬁcient to overcome yet another recently discovered inconsistency between experi - mental data and the common theoretical assumption that for any given instantaneous pulling force , the chemical bond be - tween ligand and receptor always dissociates according to a unique instantaneous decay rate , independent of the pulling velocity or any other system property apart from the instan - taneous pulling force . A third often adopted assumption which is disproved by our present work is that the force - extension characteristic can be satisfactorily approximated by a linear behavior . Ideally , one would instead use a simple realistic model to describe the force - extension curve . Unfortunately , no such model ex - ists which incorporates all components of the entire elastic entity composed of cantilever , linker , receptor , and ligand molecules . Realizing , however , that the parametrization of the curve is only an intermediate step in the evaluation , any function which satisfactorily describes the force - extension characteristic over the full range of pulling forces may be used . In our experiment second degree polynomials were sufﬁcient . For other experiments more complicated functions may be necessary or for these systems physical models may exist (cid:1) e . g . , the freely jointed chain (cid:1) FJC (cid:2) or a worm - like chain (cid:1) WLJ (cid:2) model (cid:2) where the model parameters provide interesting information about the system . To generalize our classiﬁcation scheme to these cases only little modiﬁcations in the algorithm described in Sec . III A are necessary . By using an extension of the usually applied model to evaluate single - molecule pulling experiments we were able to consistently explain the experimental ﬁndings from the representative experiment . In doing so the rate constant of dissociation , the distance between the potential minimum and the barrier , as well as the variations of this distance can be determined in a quantitative manner . Finally , we like to point out that our method for process - ing and analyzing the force - distance characteristic has the potential to detect and analyze different subpopulations of the force - extension characteristic separately , which could give insights into different modes of binding between the receptor and the respective ligand .
