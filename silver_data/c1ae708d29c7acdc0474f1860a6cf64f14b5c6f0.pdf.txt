EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 2 Exploring AI - Generated Text in Student Writing : How Does AI Help ? Abstract English as a foreign language ( EFL ) students’ use of text generated from artificial intelligence ( AI ) natural language generation ( NLG ) tools may improve their writing quality . However , it remains unclear to what extent AI - generated text in these students’ writing might lead to higher - quality writing . We explored 23 Hong Kong secondary school students’ attempts to write stories comprising their own words and AI - generated text . Human experts scored the stories for dimensions of content , language , and organization . We analyzed the basic organization and structure and syntactic complexity of the stories’ AI - generated text and performed multiple linear regression and cluster analyses . The results show the number of human words and the number of AI - generated words contribute significantly to scores . Besides , students can be grouped into competent and less competent writers who use more AI - generated text or less AI - generated text compared to their peers . Comparisons of the clusters reveal some benefit of AI - generated text in improving the quality of both high - scoring students’ and low - scoring students’ writing . The findings can inform pedagogical strategies to use AI - generated text for EFL students’ writing and to address digital divides . This study contributes designs of NLG tools and writing activities to implement AI - generated text in schools .

In the past decade , designing artificial intelligence ( AI ) education has become a strategic priority for educators around the world ( Sing et al . , 2022 ) . Generally , the term ‘AI education’ can be understood in two ways : learning with AI and learning about AI . The former involves applying AI - enabled technologies in teaching and learning practice ( Wang & Cheng , 2021 ) such that students develop interaction strategies with AI to solve authentic problems and tasks ( Kim et al . , 2022 ) . The latter refers to the teaching and learning of AI as a new subject , for instance , to develop an understanding of AI , AI futures , and procedural use of AI ( Kim et al . , 2022 ) , and to learn AI development skills such as coding ( Wang & Cheng , 2021 ) . In language education , AI - powered technologies have been integrated into classrooms to enable students’ learning with AI and foster their development of different language skills , such as speaking ( Lin & Mubarok , 2021 ; Yang et al . , 2022 ) and listening ( Dizon , 2020 ) . Particularly , writing researchers and educators have designed and developed a variety of AI - enabled tools such as intelligent writing assistants ( Godwin - Jones , 2022 ) , educational chatbots ( Guo et al . , 2022 ) , and automated writing evaluation systems ( Chen et al . , 2022 ) , to enhance students’ learning to write . Recently , ChatGPT ( https : / / openai . com / blog / chatgpt / ) , a chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched in November 2022 , has brought mainstream attention to AI’s capability to predict and to generate text given an input ( Bender et al . , 2021 ) . AI - generated text can be coherent , lengthy , indistinguishable from human writing ( Brown et al . , 2020 ) , and highly opinionated ( Jakesch et al . , 2023 ) . Not least for this reason , universities ( Yau & Chan , 2023 ) and other institutions ( Stack Exchange Inc . , 2022 ) have been banning compositions comprising AI - generated text . In more mundane forms , AI’s natural language generation ( NLG ) capability ( Gatt & Krahmer , 2018 ) has been integrated into the everyday functionality of email clients , Internet EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 4 search , and word processors ( Godwin - Jones , 2022 ) . Importantly , AI - NLG tools have become an emergent resource for the writing classroom . Recent studies have provided some evidence that students’ collaboration with AI - NLG tools can improve their writing skills . For example , Dizon and Gayed ( 2021 ) found that Japanese university students who wrote with Grammarly , a predictive text and intelligent writing assistant , produced more lexical variation and fewer grammatical errors . Liu et al . ( 2021 ) indicated that a reflective thinking , AI - supported English writing approach improved university students’ writing quality . Kangasharju et al . ( 2022 ) designed a Poem Machine that drafted poems as models for students , and suggested their tool inspired and supported lower secondary students when they engaged in writing poems . To improve students’ argumentative essay writing , Guo et al . ( 2022 ) proposed a chatbot - assisted approach that might better facilitate the scaffolding of students’ idea production and argument construction . Yet , it should be noted that although AI’s NLG capability has been integrated into these instructional tools , these technologies often have very narrow or predetermined conversational paths ( Kuhail et al . , 2023 ) , and appear not to be developed from the latest computer network architecture ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) . Far from ChatGPT’s capability to dynamically predict text , dated technical designs of educational AI - NLG tools constrain AI capabilities and ultimately what can be learned about and with AI in education . Human - AI Collaborative Writing Process The integration of AI - NLG tools into writers’ writing processes has enabled collaborative writing between humans and AI . During such collaboration , some issues may require attention . For example , Jakesch et al . ( 2023 ) provided evidence that co - writing with generative AI can shift people’s attitudes and opinions on a single topic , even if unintended . In the educational setting , writing teachers should pay careful attention to such issues when they try to apply AI - NLG tools EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 5 into their teaching practice . Wang et al . ( 2023 ) identified different approaches by which students interacted with AI agents for language learning , and suggested different gains of student learning based on interaction approach , indicating the need for students to learn effective interactions with AI . Hence , writing teachers need to develop pedagogical strategies to foster students’ successful collaboration with AI agents in generating written texts . Moreover , using AI - NLG tools requires teachers to identify suitable tasks for student - AI collaborative writing and appropriate evaluation methods for assessing compositions using human words and AI - generated text ( Godwin - Jones , 2022 ) . To reach these goals , an important first step would be to understand students’ interactions with text generated from AI - NLG tools to complete written compositions . Based on a cognitive process theory of writing ( Flower & Hayes , 1981 ) , we have viewed a student’s writing as iterative decision - making , specifically , for the generation and structuring of ideas , in response to a rhetorical problem such as a school assignment . In this model , a difference between skilled writers and novice writers is that the former can make a wider variety and more specific decisions than the latter . The practical implications are that writing must not only be taught but also cultivated per students’ needs , not imposed from a teacher’s hands ( Vygotsky , 1978 ) . Importantly , we adopt a sociocultural theory to understand the development of students’ writing ( Prior , 2006 ) . Within this paradigm , writing is a collaborative effort , situated in a socio - technical environment and mediated by elements in the environment . In traditional classrooms , teachers mediate students’ writing , although there is evidence showing students do not receive sufficient writing instruction and feedback from teachers in a classroom context ( Butterfuss et al . , 2022 ) . Furthermore , students increasingly consult online sources and repurpose information from those sources for their writing ( Tan , 2023 ) . Ultimately , students need strategies to navigate the elements of their socio - technical environment so as to improve the quality of their EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 6 writing ( Crossley et al . , 2016 ) . With AI - generated text becoming one of the elements in the environment , students need to develop strategies to effectively utilize the text . Moreover , since different students may perceive AI’s affordances in different ways , either as an opportunity or a constraint ( Jeon , 2022 ) , it will be necessary to understand learner differences in using AI - generated text for language learning . However , so far few studies have been conducted to examine how students cope with AI - generated text to produce compositions , how their interactions with the text reflect learner differences , and what types of student - AI interactions may lead to successful writing outcomes . This Study To better understand how students write with AI that dynamically generates text , this study explores the integration of text generated from state - of - the - art ( SOTA ) AI - NLG tools to the educational context of English as a foreign language ( EFL ) students’ written compositions ( i . e . , narrative stories ) . This article reports on a study exploring language features of AI - generated text in students’ compositions and their association with human - rated scores of the compositions . A multiple linear regression analysis and a cluster analysis were employed to provide insights into how distinct groups of students have interacted with AI - generated text to complete compositions . Specifically , the study was guided by the following three research questions ( RQs ) : RQ1 : What are the language features of AI - generated text in students’ compositions written with AI ? RQ2 : What patterns of interaction with AI - generated text can be identified in students’ compositions and what are their differences ? EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 7 RQ3 : How do students’ interaction patterns with AI - generated text impact and benefit their writing , if at all ? Language features within AI - generated text were adopted in the study as an indicator of students’ strategies for using AI - NLG tools for writing , since these features can reflect a student writer’s knowledge and facilitate their growth ( Crossley , 2020 ) . Although language features have been measured in compositions written with NLG tools that generate content ( Gayed et al . , 2022 ) , to the best of our knowledge no attempt has been made to measure the language features of AI - generated text in students’ compositions and to investigate how the use of AI - generated , English language text may improve the quality of EFL students’ writing , if at all . By measuring the language features of AI - generated text in students’ compositions , and experts’ ratings of students’ compositions , we aim to identify students’ patterns of interaction with AI - generated text to complete written compositions . By identifying any benefit from using AI - generated text on expert ratings of writing quality , we hope to inform teaching and learning practice in the EFL classroom , enabling teachers to deliver effective instructional strategies and helping students to make better decisions about using AI - generated text . Methodology Research Participants and Context This study was conducted in two Hong Kong secondary schools from December 2022 to January 2023 . One school , Ho Man Tin ( HMT ) School ( pseudonym ) receives primary school students at the 88 - 99th percentile of academic achievement in its geographic district . The other school , Chai Wan ( CW ) School ( pseudonym ) receives primary school students at the 44 - 55th percentile of academic achievement in its geographic district . In both schools , a creative writing contest was prosecuted and required student participants to create a SOTA AI - NLG tool and then EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 8 to use that tool to co - author a short story . To support the contest , students attended two workshops presented by the first author . In the first workshop , students learned to code their SOTA AI - NLG tool . They used Python programming language , Gradio software development kit , and HuggingFace , a repository for machine - learning ( ML ) models and applications . A language model forms the basis of any AI - NLG tool and those available to students on Hugging Face vary widely in size , from GPT2’s 117 million parameters ( Radford et al . , 2019 ) to GPT - J’s six billion parameters ( Wang & Komatsuzaki , 2021 ) . However , they are generally smaller than the largest , proprietary language models such as ChatGPT , which can exceed 100 billion parameters ( Brown et al . , 2020 ) . Importantly , the Hugging Face language models are open - source , free - to - use and do not incur the larger , proprietary language models’ huge environmental and financial costs to develop and maintain ( Bender et al . , 2021 ) . Thus , smaller language models can be rapidly implemented in schools . Students designed AI - NLG tools according to their preferences and coding skills . Initially , students were taught to design an AI - NLG tool by using one language model , with one textbox for human text input and one text box of AI - generated text output . The AI - generated text generally includes proper English language capitalization , punctuation and spacing , and its length can vary from words to a paragraph ( see Figure 1 ) . Subsequently , students were taught to design an AI - NLG tool by using more than one language model so that the tool could comprise several text boxes of AI - generated text output ( see Figure 2 ) . EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 9 Figure 1 An AI - NLG tool comprising one language model and one textbox of output Figure 2 An AI - NLG tool comprising three language models and three textboxes of output In the second workshop , students learned to interact with their AI - NLG tool to write a story . Specifically , they were taught different prompting methods and digital writing skills for EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 10 selecting AI - generated text , and editing that text into a story . Students used their AI - NLG tools for 45 minutes . They could use the tools freely and repeatedly at that time . Students did not need to complete their short stories for contest submission during that time . Data Collection Students wrote stories on Google Docs and shared their docs with the first author . Any story that exceeded the contest’s 500 - word limit was not included in this study . Any story that appeared incomplete but fell within the 500 - word limit was included in this study . Thus , this study collected 23 stories , 16 from HMT School students and seven from CW School students . Since the stories comprise a student’s own words and AI - generated text , to facilitate our analysis of students’ interaction patterns with AI - generated text , a student highlighted the student’s own text in red and AI - generated text in black ( see Figure 3 ) . EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 11 Figure 3 A story written on Google Docs with a student’s words and AI - generated text Scoring of Stories To prepare each story for human scoring , we removed a student’s name and indicators of a student’s text and AI - generated text . For human scoring , we assembled EFL subject matter experts : Aberdeen School’s Native English Teacher ( NET ) ; Bowen School’s English panel head ; and a postgraduate student researching EFL writing . To establish reliability in human scoring , the NET prepared a scoring rubric ( see Appendix A ) adapted from a standardized rubric that is used to assess the quality of English language writing in Hong Kong secondary schools and is familiar to the human scorers . The scorers were instructed to score stories for content ( C ) ( e . g . , creativity , task completion , etc . ) , language ( L ) ( e . g . , grammar , punctuation , spelling , etc . ) and EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 12 organization ( O ) ( e . g . , idea development and cohesiveness ) . The full mark for each criterion was five and a score was awarded in increments of one . Besides providing annotated examples of stories , the NET briefed the other two scorers and wrote notes for the awarding of specific marks ( see Appendix A ) . These include awarding a score of one for C if a story was incomplete , and a story’s L and O scores not exceeding the C score plus / minus one . Two experts independently marked the stories and we calculated the proportion of agreement ( DeCuir - Gunby et al . , 2010 ) . The proportion of agreement for C was 73 % , L 87 % and O 70 % . For all but two of the 23 stories , the scorers produced either the exact same total CLO mark , that is , the sum of C , L and O scores , or showed a total mark difference of only one mark ( see Appendix B ) . To reconcile any possible differences in scoring , we averaged the scores awarded by the two experts . The scoring rubric includes an AI Words criterion with descriptors . These descriptors were developed from our literature review and a pilot study of four students’ stories written using their own words and AI - generated text . They were developed from measures of basic structure and organization and syntactic complexity that appeared associated with higher CLO scores . The descriptors are organized according to scaffolded performance levels with the fine - grain use of AI - generated text set at the lowest performance level and the broadest use of AI - generated text set at the highest performance level . In other words , a story must evidence the descriptor at the lowest performance level before being assessed at a higher performance level . The NET scored de - anonymized versions of students’ stories for the AI Words dimension . Data Analysis To analyze language features of student’s stories written with NLG tools , we operationalized the measures for the basic structure and organization of a composition and the syntactic complexity of AI - generated text as set out in the scoring rubric . Therefore , we sought EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 13 to count the number of words in a story , and the number of AI - generated words and the number of student words . Furthermore , we sought to count the number of AI - generated text instances or chunks , in a story . An AI chunk is defined as AI - generated text embedded within students’ own text instances or chunks . Next , we counted three syntactic forms of AI - generated text . Specifically , we defined short , medium and long AI chunks to be AI - generated text shorter than five words in length , longer than or equal to five words in length or sentence length , and longer than a sentence in length respectively . For instance , an instance of an AI - generated punctuation mark would be categorized as a short AI chunk . In our analysis , we did not find any instances of an AI - generated sentence that was shorter than five words in length . We analyzed language features in stories using the functions available on Google Docs . We prepared on Excel the descriptive statistics for the basic organization and structure and syntactic complexity measures . In phase 1 of our findings , we examine these descriptive statistics alongside human - rated scores . For insights into what patterns of interactions with AI - generated text might be more effective for human ratings of writing , we used statistical methods to compare scores from human raters with basic organization and structure and syntactic complexity statistics . In phase 2 , we analyze the data using Multiple Linear Regression ( MLR ; Aiken et al . , 2005 ) , a statistical technique that describes the relationship between multiple variables , while taking the effect of each variable into account . For example , the algorithm explores the statistical relationship between students’ score , amount of AI generated words used in their writing , and the actual length of their writing , while exposing how these variables may affect the quality of the students’ writing outcome . EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 14 Lastly , in phase 3 we focus on analyzing patterns and effects of how AI’s assistance may improve students’ writing quality . Here , we perform cluster analysis using unsupervised machine learning techniques Expectation - Maximization ( EM ) Algorithm ( Dempster et al . , 1977 ) , K - Means Clustering ( Macqueen , 1967 ) , and Mean - Shift Clustering ( Fukunaga et al . , 1975 ) . Results and Discussion In this section , we first present and discuss the descriptive statistics of language features and scores . Second , we present and discuss the results of the multiple linear regression analysis and finally , the cluster analysis . Phase 1 : Descriptive Statistics of Language Features and Scores As shown in Table 1 , 21 out of the 23 stories contain AI chunks , and 19 of them contain long AI chunks but only 13 of them contain short AI chunks . If one considers that embedding shorter AI chunks into the stories is a better synthesis between the AI - generated and human - written text , this result may imply that it is challenging to achieve this synthesis as less students achieved this goal . In addition , each story with short , medium and long AI chunks contains an average of 3 . 77 , 3 . 16 and 2 . 21 of them respectively , and each such story contains an average of 6 . 67 AI chunks . All these measures show a large standard deviation , implying that there is a large variation in students’ intention in embedding AI - generated words in their stories . Moreover , as shown in Table 1 , the number of AI - generated words , human written words and the total number of words in the stories are 81 . 57 , 248 . 57 and 323 . 04 respectively , and the standard deviation in all these measures is large . While some variation in the number of AI words may come from the variation in the length of the stories , this may still imply that students vary a lot in their intention to incorporate AI - generated text . To better understand this variation , we show the distribution of the percentage of AI - generated words in Figure 4 . As we can see in EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 15 Table 1 , although the average percentage of the usage of AI words is roughly 28 % , and a majority of the students used less than 20 % of AI words in their stories , there are some students who embedded a large percentage of AI words up to almost 90 % . This again shows that students have a large variation in embedding AI - generated text in their stories .

Table 2 shows the average content ( C ) , language ( L ) , organization ( O ) scores , as well as the average CLO scores , AI words scores , and the grand total scores which is the sum of the CLO and AI words scores . As shown in Table 2 , students scored roughly equally in the C , L , O as well as the AI words categories . Figure 5 shows the distribution of the grand total score . The scores spread widely across the whole range from 0 to the full mark of 20 . These results implied that the markers consider that there is a large variation in students’ performance .

We remark that instead of such multiple linear regression model , computing merely the Pearson correlation between the scores and the variables does not accurately represent the casualty relation between them , as they may be simultaneously affected by other variables and are not the cause and effect to each other as suggested by a high Pearson correlation coefficient . The multiple linear regression model can eliminate such confounding impact and reveal the dependence of scores on individual factors : 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 = 𝑚 ! 𝑥 ! + 𝑚 " 𝑥 " + 𝑚 # 𝑥 # + 𝑚 $ 𝑥 $ + 𝑚 % 𝑥 % + 𝑚 & 𝑥 & + 𝐶 , Equation ( 1 ) where 𝑥 ! = number of short AI chunks , 𝑥 " = number of medium AI chunks , 𝑥 # = number of long AI chunks , 𝑥 $ = number of human chunks , 𝑥 % = number of AI words , and 𝑥 & = number of human words . Although a linear relationship may not fully capture the casualty relationship between scores and variables , but as shown in the last column of Table 3 , the model is highly statistically significant in explaining various scores , and later on give us interesting interpretations in how the scores of stories depends on the incorporation of AI - generated text . To avoid the phenomenon called co - linearity which may mask the correlation of related factors with the scores , we have not included the percentage of AI words in the model as it is related to the number of AI words and human words in the stories . By the method of least squares ( Dekking et al . , 2005 ) , one can obtain the best fitted parameters 𝑚 ’ ’s in the model , but the values of 𝑚 ’ may not fully represent the correlation of the variable 𝑥 ’ with scores since 𝑥 ’ ’s are not normalized . We thus compute the so - called partial correlations ( Brown & Hendrix , 2005 ) , which are correlations between the score and the variables after removing the co - dependence on all other variables in Equation 1 . For instance , the EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 19 partial correlation 𝐶 + ( 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 , 𝑥 ! ) between the score and 𝑥 ! is related to the fitted parameter 𝑚 ! through the following relation : 𝐶 + ( 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 , 𝑥 ! ) = 𝑚 ! × 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 ( 𝑥 ! ) ( ! ) * ( ( " , … , ( # ) 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 ( 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 ) / 0123 ) * ( ( " , … , ( # ) Where 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 ( 𝑥 ! ) ( ! ) * ( ( " , … , ( # ) and 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 ( 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 ) / 0123 ) * ( ( " , … , ( # ) correspond to the residuals of the linear regression models in fitting x _ 1 and the score respectively and separately using only the factors 𝑥 " , … , 𝑥 & ( Dekking et al . , 2005 ) , and hence the co - dependence on factors 𝑥 " , … , 𝑥 & are eliminated in the partial correlation 𝐶 + ( 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 , 𝑥 ! ) . Table 3 shows the results of partial correlation between various scoring items and the variables 𝑥 ! , … , 𝑥 & . Except AI word scores , all scores are strongly positively correlated with the number of human words , with a value of 𝐶 + > 0 . 9 , and positively correlated with the number of AI words , with a value of 𝐶 + ≈ 0 . 5 , and these partial correlations are all statistically significant . As the contest limited all stories to 500 words or less , these results imply that more competent students will use more words , regardless of their own words or AI - generated text , to complete their stories and score higher . We also note that although the scores are more strongly correlated and statistically significant with the number of human words , the number of AI words also plays its role in contributing to all C , L , O scores significantly . Per existing research that a competent writer has capacity to edit and to improve so that a completed text might be very different from a first draft ( Flower & Hayes , 1981 ) , this may imply that competent writers not only write more words , but they can synthesize AI words or inspiration into their own writing which contributes to C , L and O criteria . One interesting observation is that AI word scores were significantly positively and negatively correlated with the number of human chunks and the number of medium AI chunks , EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 20 respectively . There are three performance levels to achieve for the AI Words criterion : ( 1 ) AI words in at least one chunk and at least one short chunk ; ( 2 ) at least eight chunks of AI words ; ( 3 ) no more than 33 % AI words . For competent students who are keen to succeed in the contest , they may decide to embed human chunks in longer AI chunks and avoid using medium AI chunks to increase the number of AI chunks . Hence their positive and the negative partial correlations with AI words score . These results may also imply that students were well aware of the competition rules , and developed strategies for the efficient use of AI words in their stories .

The last column shows the p - value of the corresponding linear regression model in explaining the various scores by the 6 factors . Phase 3 : Cluster Analysis We used cluster analysis to group students according to the language features of AI - generated text in their stories and the stories’ human - rated scores . Our cluster analysis algorithms considered the following language features and scores : the number of AI chunks ( short , medium , and long ) , the percentage of AI - generated words used in a story , the total number of words in a story , the C score , the L score , the O score , the total CLO score , and finally the AI Words score . Moreover , we used different algorithms to generate different types of clusters . EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 22 Algorithm 1 : EM - Algorithm EM - Algorithm is an algorithm that uses Gaussian distribution to probabilistically estimate the likelihood of data points belonging to a particular cluster . The algorithm is configured to cluster the dataset into eight groups of students and the output is described in Figure 6 . Figure 6 The Outputs from EM - Algorithm First , we observe students in clusters Zero , Two , and Seven received a full or near full CLO score . Additionally , AI - generated words made up only 9 % to 19 % of their total word count , which is low compared to other clusters . The stories written by students in these three clusters also tend to be longer , nearer the 500 - word limit , compared to other clusters . This indicates that EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 23 the most competent writers demonstrate less inclination to seek assistance from AI , which confirms results from descriptive statistics and MLR . Although students in these three clusters appeared to be competent writers that relied less on AI - generated text , we observed a difference in these clusters’ AI Words scores . On the one hand , students in cluster Zero performed quite well in the AI Words criterion . On the other hand , all students in clusters Two and Seven received no score for the AI Words criterion . This may indicate these students’ ignorance or misunderstanding about the scoring rubric descriptors ; or these students intentionally did not use AI - generated text according to the scoring rubric descriptors . Among clusters of high users of AI - generated text , we observed two different results . Students in clusters Four and Five wrote stories with AI - generated words comprising 50 % to 89 % of the total number of words . Compared to other students , they scored relatively high on their CLO ( 80th percentile ) , specifically , 4 . 5 for C , 4 . 5 for O and 4 . 25 for L . On the other hand , cluster Three produced stories with AI - generated words comprising 55 % to 78 % of the total number of words but the students’ CLO score was low ; specifically , they scored 1 point for C and O criteria , and 2 points for the L criteria . The CLO scores of cluster Three indicate that those students did not submit complete stories , for which reason they could not exceed 1 point for the C criteria but could achieve an additional point for L . We interpret cluster Three as students who did not appear to be competent writers , had decided to seek more assistance from AI - generated text , but had not developed effective strategies to leverage AI - generated text in their writing . In this way , our study provides evidence to question claims that compositions comprising exclusively AI - generated text would be scored positively for cohesiveness and grammatical accuracy ( Godwin - Jones , 2022 ) , for which reason automatic writing evaluation systems would EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 24 have limited value . On the other hand , the results suggest that students in clusters Four and Five were more competent writers , had decided to seek more assistance from AI - generated text , and had developed effective strategies to incorporate more AI - generated text in their stories . Algorithm 2 : K - Means Clustering K - Means Clustering statistically identifies the K number of clusters in the dataset by measuring the distance between each data to the center of each cluster ( see Figure 7 ) . Like with the EM - Algorithm clustering analysis , we configured K to 8 clusters . K - means Clustering revealed additional insights into students’ interaction patterns with AI - generated text – the attribution of specific language features of AI - generated text in stories to human - rated scores . Figure 7 The Outputs from K - Means Algorithm EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 25 Students in cluster One wrote the longest stories of at least 449 words and AI - generated words comprised only 19 % of their stories’ words . However , less than half of the students in this cluster achieved a full CLO score of 15 . This indicates that the use of AI - generated text does not necessarily contribute to the highest CLO performance levels . Another observation is that students in cluster Zero scored low on CLO and on AI Words , and wrote the least number of words in their stories , 157 words on average , compared to all students . The low CLO scores indicate that students did not submit complete stories . Additionally , they had not used AI - generated text to extend their writing . The implication is that less competent writers may lack the decision - making ability and strategies by which they might use AI - generated text to complete writing tasks . Algorithm 3 : Mean - Shift Clustering Different from EM - Algorithm and K - Means Clustering , Mean - Shift Clustering does not require a predetermined number of clusters . Instead , it determines the number of clusters in a dataset and assigns each data point to the clusters by shifting points towards the highest density ( or mean value ) in each cluster ( see Figure 8 ) . This algorithm grouped the students into six clusters . EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 26 Figure 8 The Outputs from Means - Shift Algorithm One observation was that the use rate of AI - words varied greatly , from 0 to 77 . 4 % , in cluster One , which featured students with the lowest CLO scores and the shortest stories . This indicates that the length of a story is a more accurate indicator of a student’s writing competence than the number of AI - words used in a story . Additionally , a students’ higher use of AI - generated text might improve the student’s CLO score if the student were to write nothing at all without AI - generated text . Therefore , this cluster provides an initial clue that the use of AI - generated text does not universally compensate for students’ writing competence . To summarize , we plot three - dimensional graphs of the results for each cluster analysis algorithm , showing a horizontal view in Figure 9 and a vertical view in Figure 10 . From these three - dimensional graphs , visually the students can be categorized into four super clusters , 1 ) EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 27 students with high CLO scores , but fewer AI words ; 2 ) students with high scores , but more AI words ; 3 ) students with low scores , but fewer AI words ; and 4 ) students with low scores , but more AI words . Figure 9 Horizontal View of Three Clustering Algorithm Three - dimensional Graphs Note . The x - axis is the normalized average CLO score between 0 and 100 ; the y - axis is the percentage of AI words used in the writing ; and the z - axis is the cluster ID . Figure 10 Vertical View of Three Clustering Algorithm Three - dimensional Graphs EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 28 Conclusion Major Findings The descriptive statistics show a large variation in students’ use of AI - generated text in their stories . At the same time , human scoring indicates a large variation in the C , L and O scores of students’ stories . A multiple linear regression of AI - generated text language features and CLO scores show the number of human words and the number of AI - generated words contribute significantly to CLO scores . Significant correlations between different syntactic forms of AI - generated text and AI Words scores highlight a group of competent and strategic students who use AI - generated text as a means to boost their AI Words scores . Clustering analyses of students show groups of competent writers that strategically use specific syntactic forms of AI - generated text but less AI - generated text than their peers ; and groups that effectively use more AI - generated text . The analyses also reveal groups of less competent writers that use little AI - generated text and may not have strategies for its effective use ; and groups that use more AI - generated text and that benefit from its use if they were to otherwise write nothing at all . In sum , our study has evidenced that students’ use of AI - generated text does not universally benefit their writing . Moreover , students’ access to AI - generated text from SOTA - NLG tools does not preclude students using AI - generated text much in their writing and students using it to improve human - rated scores of their writing performance . Pedagogical Implications Our study can inform the flexible design of AI - related curricula to address the various needs of schools and students , especially for secondary education for which there has been little EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 29 research ( Chiu , 2021 ) . First , our study contributes a curricular effort to achieve both learning about AI and learning with AI ( Ali et al . , 2021 ; Williams et al . , 2022 ) . Specifically , as writing activities with NLG tools have been scarce ( Lin & Chang , 2020 ) , our study contributes design specifications for an authentic writing task and SOTA NLG - tools that can be freely replicated and adapted . Second , we contribute specific measures of basic structure and organization and syntactic complexity of AI - generated text that can inform teaching and learning practice with AI - generated text . Furthermore , our findings can inform teachers’ instructional methods for different groups of EFL students to complete writing tasks with AI - generated text from SOTA NLG - tools . More competent writers are more able to discern and optimize the use of AI to complete a high - quality composition . These writers can benefit from fine - grain instruction on different language features of AI - generated text , such as syntactic forms , and ways to integrate such text so as to improve writing quality . For less competent student writers , they will need additional instruction from teachers , peers , and other elements in their writing classroom to improve their writing competence , to decide how to use AI - generated text and then how to develop strategic and effective use of AI - generated text for writing of higher quality . Appropriate instructional methods for different groups of students to use AI - generated text are necessary to broach digital divides between writers of different competence and between schools . Without differentiated methods , AI - generated text may widen these digital divides . Finally , some universities and institutions have been banning their students’ use of AI - generated text for classroom , coursework , and assessment tasks , which might be in part due to an unclear picture of how AI - generated text can be used in an effective and ethically correct way . EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 30 Our empirical evidence supports such a rationale for those policies and we find it essential to continue scrutinizing the pedagogical value of AI - generated text in education . Limitations and Future Research Given the dearth of research on human - AI collaborative writing , for experts’ scoring of AI - generated text , we adapted an existing scoring rubric , which is essential for assessing writing in classroom contexts ( Roscoe et al . , 2013 ) . Moreover , we operationalized relatively simple measures of basic structure and organization and syntactic complexity to study AI - generated text in compositions . We did not study AI - generated text for other constructs of language features that predict human judgements of both first language and EFL writing proficiency : lexical sophistication ( i . e . , the use of advanced words that indicate lexical knowledge , often measured by number - of - word calculations ) ; and text cohesion ( i . e . , the interconnectivity of text segments ) ( Crossley , 2020 ) ; nor did we study AI - generated text in terms of discourse features . Future studies may explore quality writing with AI - generated text by operationalizing measures for these other constructs or for discourse features . With further study with additional measures , we can better understand how competent writers have effectively integrated larger quantities of AI - generated text into their writing . In our study , students composed short stories and in subsequent research can expand students’ writing to argumentative and factual text types . Furthermore , our study’s SOTA AI - NLG tools utilized open - source , free - to - use language models and could output at most a paragraph of text . Subsequent research could fine - tune such models to improve their capacity to generate appropriate language for the target text type and explore such models’ contributions to student writing . Besides , study should expand to the largest , proprietary language language models like ChatGPT and to AI - NLG tools that can generate several paragraphs of text . EXPLORING AI - GENERATED TEXT IN STUDENT WRITING 31 Although AI - NLG tools hold promise to improve students’ writing , SOTA AI - NLG tools that predict text suffer limitations and their use raises risk in the writing classroom . One limitation is such tools’ propensity to hallucinate , that is , to generate text that deviates from its source input and fails to meet user expectations ( Ji et al . , 2022 ) . Such text can comprise offensive or biased material ( Bender et al . , 2021 ) , or factually incorrect and nonsensical answers , although plausible sounding ( OpenAI , 2022 ) . Another limitation is such tools’ propensity to degenerate , that is , to generate bland and repetitive text ( Holtzman et al . , 2020 ) . Therefore , research will be necessary into prompt programming ( Reynolds & McDonell , 2021 ) of SOTA AI - NLG tools in the writing classroom , that is , the careful selection of input by which a student interacts with and controls an AI - NLG tool to perform a desired task . Since rewriting a prompt can significantly change a tool’s performance , future studies should investigate the conditions under which a student would prompt a SOTA AI - NLG tool , what prompts students have used to generate text , and whether students perceive any AI - generated text as satisfactory for integration into a composition . Future research may explore students’ interactions with AI - NLG tools in the writing process , using methods such as screen recordings , think - aloud protocols , interviews , and stimulated recalls , to provide a complete understanding of how the tools contribute to students’ writing and how different students use AI for writing .
