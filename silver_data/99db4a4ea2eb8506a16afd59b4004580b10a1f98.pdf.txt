ONCOLOGY REPORTS 36 : 3497 - 3503 , 2016 Abstract . Cortactin is a scaffolding protein that regulates Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization . We showed in a previous study that cortactin was highly expressed in human stage II - III colorectal cancer ( CRC ) tissues . In the present study , using colony formation and CCK - 8 assays , we showed that overexpression of cortactin accelerated the proliferation of CRC cells . Flow cytometric assays revealed that cortactin promoted G1 / S phase cell cycle transition . Later , we constructed the phosphorylation mutation of cortactin at the Tyr421 residue . Colony formation and CCK - 8 assays showed that cortactin / Tyr421A lost its ability to promote cell proliferation . Western blot analysis indicated that cortactin activated cyclin D1 , but not cortactin / Tyr421A . Further study in nude mice revealed that there was a greater decrease in both tumor volume and tumor weight in animals injected with SW480 / cortactin / Tyr421A cells than in those injected with SW480 / cortactin / WT cells . Thus , the present study demon - strates that the cortactin Tyr421 residue is required to promote cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo . Introduction Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is a malignancy with high incidence and mortality , placing a heavy economic burden on public health systems worldwide ( 1 ) . A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in CRC tumorigenesis may provide new approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of CRC . Our laboratory previously found that cortactin is highly expressed in human stage II - III CRC and that the expression of cortactin is an independent prognostic factor for disease - free and overall survival ( 2 ) . Cortactin , encoded by the CTTN ( also known as EMS1 ) gene , is an F - actin binding protein that recruits Arp2 / 3 complex proteins to F - actin to regulate actin nucleation , and cytoskeletal assembly and adhesion ( 3 ) . Cortactin is mainly located in the cell cortex and contains 4 major domains : the N - terminal acidic ( NTA ) domain , a tandem repeat region , a proline - rich region and an SH3 domain . The proline - rich domain includes Tyr421 , Tyr466 ( Tyr470 in humans ) and Tyr482 ( Tyr486 in humans ) . It is generally thought to be the signaling end of the molecule , as it contains phosphorylation sites for a number of kinases including src ( 4 ) . Increased levels of cortactin are involved in the invasion and metastasis of various types of cancers , including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) ( 5 ) , esophageal ( 6 ) , gastric ( 7 ) and hepatocellular cancer ( 8 ) , melanoma ( 9 ) , CRC ( 2 , 10 ) and ovarian cancer ( 11 ) . As mentioned above , cortactin plays a significant role in cancer metastasis , but little is known concerning its role in cell proliferation . Wei et al demonstrated that cortactin overexpression in gastric cancer SGC - 7901 cells accelerated tumor growth by promoting EGFR expression and activating the EGFR signaling pathway ( 12 ) . In the present study , we found that cortactin promoted cell proliferation by activating cyclin D1 in CRC . A mutation of cortactin at the Tyr421 phosphorylation site impaired its ability to promote CRC cell growth . Materials and methods Cell culture and transfection . The human CRC cell lines SW1116 and SW480 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ; Manassas , VA , USA ) . These cell lines were cultured in RPMI - 1640 medium . All media were supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 100 U / ml penicillin , and 100 µg / ml streptomycin . They were then cultured at 37˚C with 5 % CO 2 . The plasmids for cortactin knockdown and lenti - virus particles for cortactin overexpression were constructed by Shanghai GenePharma ( Shanghai , China ) . A mutated form of cortactin ( mutation at the Tyr421 phosphorylation site , Tyr mutant to alanine with flag as tag ) was obtained from Shanghai USEN Biological Technology ( Shanghai , China ) . The plasmids and lentivirus were transfected according to the Cortactin contributes to the tumorigenicity of colorectal cancer by promoting cell proliferation HUO WU * , XI CHENG * , XIAOPIN JI * , YONGGANG HE , XIAOQIAN JING , HAOXUAN WU and REN ZHAO Department of General Surgery , Shanghai Institute of Digestive Surgery , Ruijin Hospital , Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine , Shanghai 200025 , P .

BALB / c nude mice at the age of 4 weeks were purchased from the Institute of Zoology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences , and housed in a dedicated SPF facility at the Laboratory Animal Center of Ruijin Hospital . SW480 / cortactin / WT cells ( 2x10 6 ) were resuspended in 100 µl PBS and injected into the left side of each nude mouse . Equal numbers of SW480 / cortactin / Tyr421A cells were injected into the right sides of other nude mice . Tumor length ( L ) and width ( W ) were measured every week , and tumor volume ( V ) was evaluated using the following formula : V = LW 2 π / 6 .

Statistical differences between two groups were examined by the Student ' s t - test . P < 0 . 05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant result . P < 0 . 01 was considered highly significant . Results Cortactin promotes the proliferation of CRC cells . To evaluate the role of cortactin in CRC cells , cortactin expression was stably increased in the SW480 cells by lentivirus infection and reduced in the SW1116 cells by plasmid infection ( Fig . 1A ) . The CCK - 8 assay showed that overexpression of cortactin significantly increased the proliferation rate of the SW480 cells , while depletion of cortactin reduced the proliferation rate of the SW1116 cells ( Fig . 1B ) . Similar results were observed in the colony formation assays ( Fig . 1C and D ) . Our results indicate that cortactin plays an important role in promoting CRC proliferation and growth . Cortactin promotes the G1 / S phase transition of CRC cells . To explore the mechanism underlying the promotion of cellular proliferation by cortactin , a flow cytometric analysis was performed . The number of cells in the G0 / G1 , S and G2 / M phase , respectively , was analyzed . As shown in Fig . 2A , overexpression of cortactin induced the increased percentage of G1 phase cells and significantly decreased the percentage of S phase cells in the SW480 cell line . We obtained the opposite results after cortactin knockdown in the SW1116 cells ( Fig . 2B ) . These results indicate that cortactin promotes the progression of CRC cells in the G1 / S phase . Tyr421 mutation impairs the growth - promoting activity of cortactin in CRC cells . The proline - rich region of cortactin is a major regulatory phosphorylation motif that is targeted by a large number of protein kinases including Src and Erk ( 13 , 14 ) . Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin occurs at 3 tyrosine residues , Tyr421 , Tyr466 ( Tyr470 in humans ) and Tyr482 ( Tyr486 in humans ) , with Tyr466 and Tyr482 phosphorylation dependent on the phosphorylation of Tyr421 ( 15 ) . To evaluate the impact of the phosphorylation site of cortactin on CRC cell proliferation , a mutation of cortactin at the Tyr421 site was constructed ( Fig . 3A ) . As shown in Fig . 3B , compared with SW480 / cortactin / WT , SW480 / cortactin / Tyr421A exhibited a significantly lower growth rate from day 3 of cell culture . Furthermore , in the colony formation assay , the mutation of cortactin in SW480 cells resulted in reduced colony numbers as compared with the SW480 / cortactin / WT cells ( Fig . 3C and D ) . These data suggest that the Tyr421 site of cortactin is required to promote cell proliferation and growth . ONCOLOGY REPORTS 36 : 3497 - 3503 , 2016 3499 The Tyr421 mutation affects the ability of cortactin to promote cell cycle progression . To further validate the effects of cortactin on CRC cell proliferation , we explored the function of Tyr421 in cell cycle progression . Flow cyto - metric analysis showed that there was an increase in the percentage of cells in the G1 phase in the SW480 / cortactin / Tyr421A cells as compared with this percentage in the SW480 / cortactin / WT cells , while the percentage of cells at the S peak decreased when there was a mutation of cortactin at the Tyr421 site ( Fig . 4A and B ) . These results indicate that the mutation of cortactin at the Tyr421 site caused G1 arrest in the CRC cell cycle . Cortactin induces cyclin D1 expression . Having found that cortactin promoted the progression of the G1 / S phase , we sought to determine whether this was due to changes in cell cycle - related protein . Therefore , western blot analysis was performed to assess the correlation between the effects of cortactin on the expression of cyclin D1 . As shown in Fig . 5A ( in line with the results of our clone formation assay , CCK - 8 assay , and cell cycle analysis ) ectopic cortactin in SW480 cells increased the expression level of the cell cycle - related protein cyclin D1 , while silencing of cortactin in the SW1116 cells produced the opposite result . Notably , cyclin D1 was further enhanced by the overexpression of cortactin / WT in the SW480 cells but not by the mutation of cortactin at the Tyr421 site ( Fig . 5B ) . These data indicate that the Tyr421 site of cortactin is required to induce cyclin D1 . The Tyr421 mutation impairs tumorigenesis in vivo . To further determine the role of Tyr421 in the tumorigenicity of CRC , equal numbers of SW480 / cortactin / WT and SW480 / cortactin / Figure 1 .

ONCOLOGY REPORTS 36 : 3497 - 3503 , 2016 3501 Tyr421A cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 4 - week BALB / c nude mice . Tumor volumes were analyzed every week , and tumor grafts were excised and weighed after 28 days . As shown in Fig . 6A and B , tumor growth of the SW480 / cortactin / Tyr421A cells was slower than that of the SW480 / cortactin / WT cells . Moreover , the average tumor weight in the SW480 / cortactin / Tyr421A cell group was significantly lower than that in the SW480 / cortactin / WT cell group ( Fig . 6B ) . Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that SW480 / cortactin / WT tumors displayed a higher Ki67 index , whereas SW480 / cortactin / Tyr421A tumors showed reduced numbers of Ki67 - positive cells ( Fig . 6D ) . Taken together , these results suggest that cortactin promotes the tumorigenicity of CRC cells in vivo . Discussion Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is a malignant tumor of high morbidity and mortality ( 1 ) . Cell proliferation is an obvious characteristic of malignant tumors . The growth of cells involves a series of mechanisms wherein cell cycle arrest plays an important role , being responsible for the survival of the cell growth process ( 16 ) . Targeting the deregulated cell cycle is a practical strategy by which to check uncontrolled prolifera - tion in cancer cells . In the present study , we demonstrated that cortactin regulated the G1 / S checkpoint and promoted the proliferation of CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo . Cortactin was first identified as a tyrosine phosphorylated protein in Src - transformed primary chicken embryo cells ( 17 ) . The gene for cortactin is in the chromosome 11q13 region , which is frequently amplified in human cancers ( 18 ) . Cortactin is a scaffolding protein that activates the Arp2 / 3 complex through its NTA region , which promotes the branching of actin filaments and stabilizes branched networks . The cortactin SH3 domain interacts with a number of proteins that regulate membrane trafficking and cell motility ( 19 ) . Cortactin is overexpressed in a large number of cancers and appears to Figure 5 . Cortactin regulates the expression of cyclin D1 .

WU et al : CORTACTIN CONTRIBUTES TO THE TUMORIGENICITY OF COLORECTAL CANCER 3502 be an attractive target owing to its prominent role in the forma - tion and function of invadopodia as well as in the promotion of the migration and invasion of cancer cells ( 20 ) . Despite the numerous studies that have been carried out , the role of cortactin in cancer growth still requires further research . Li et al indicated that compared with CortF421F466F482 , cortactin contributes to the metastasis of breast cancer , but has no significant effects on the growth of cancer cells ( 21 ) . Ni et al found that cortactin is significantly upregulated in colon cancer tissues and that the expression of ectopic cortactin in HCT116 cells promoted cell proliferation and tumorigenicity ( 22 ) . The results presented in the present study revealed that ectopic expression of cortactin in the SW480 cells promoted cell proliferation and colony formation , while knockdown of cortactin in SW1116 cells produced the opposite results . Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin occurs on Tyr421 , Tyr466 ( Tyr470 in humans ) and Tyr482 ( Tyr486 in humans ) residues located within the proline - rich domain in response to Src and several other tyrosine kinases ( 4 , 13 , 23 ) . Notably , tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is a progressive process among the 2 main residues , with pTyr421 required for the phosphorylation of Tyr466 ( 15 ) . Recently Radhakrishnan et al demonstrated that pTyr421 cortactin is highly expressed in colon cancer , and that curcumin significantly reduced the level of pTyr421 cortactin by a direct physical interaction with PTPN1 . This ultimately led to a decrease in the migration of colon cancer cells ( 24 ) . To the best of our knowledge , the role of Tyr421 cortactin in cell proliferation has not yet been studied . The results presented in the present study showed that the Tyr421 mutation of cortactin impaired its growth - supporting Figure 6 . Effects of cortactin / Tyr421 on tumor growth in vivo .

It may be of great interest to investigate whether the Tyr470 mutation of cortactin could regulate the proliferation of cancer cells . To better understand how cortactin promotes the growth of CRC cells , we analyzed the impact of cortactin on cell cycle progression . We found that the silencing of cortactin with shRNA resulted in an accumulation of cells in the G0 / G1 phase , leading to G1 / S cell cycle arrest in the SW116 cells . In contrast , overexpression of cortactin facilitated the G1 / S transition in the SW480 cells . Notably , the mutation of cortactin at the Tyr421 site in the SW480 cells caused a G1 arrest in the cell cycle . Cylin D1 has been reported to promote cell progression by inducing cell transition from G0 / G1 to S phase ( 25 ) . Recent research has shown that cortactin enhances EGFR expression and stimu - lates the EGFR - ERK signaling pathway ( 22 ) . A previous study reported that the ERK / cyclin D1 pathway is involved in the proliferation of smooth muscle cells ( 26 ) . With this inference , our results indicate that cortactin promotes the G1 / S transition by regulating cylin D1 . Mutation of cortactin at the Tyr421 residue impaired the activation of cyclin D1 , indicating that the cortactin regulation of cyclin D1 is dependent on Tyr421 phos - phorylation . However , further studies are required to identify the detailed interac tion between cortactin and cyclin D1 . In conclusion , the present study demonstrated that cortactin plays an important role in CRC proliferation and tumorigenicity , suggesting the possibility of a new therapeutic option .
