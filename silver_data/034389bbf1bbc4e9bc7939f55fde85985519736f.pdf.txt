GPCRs recognize neurotransmitters , sensory molecules and chemotactic agents and are involved in the control of many aspects of metabolism . Since GPCRs play important roles in diverse processes such as pain perception , growth and blood pressure regulation , and viral pathogenesis , GPCRs became important target for therapeutic agents . The tridecapeptide α - factor pheromone ( W 1 H 2 W 3 L 4 Q 5 L 6 K 7 P 8 G 9 Q 10 P 11 M 12 Y 13 ) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Ste2p , its cognate GPCR , have been used extensively as a model for peptide ligand - GPCR structure and function . The power of yeast genetics has been used to examine the structure and function of Ste2p . Recently , GPCR homo - dimerization has been demonstrated for many GPCRs , although the role ( s ) of dimerization in receptor function is disputed . In this dissertation , Ste2p has been used to investigate GPCR dimerization . Part I of this dissertation is an overview of the GPCR structure and its ligand - induced conformational change with specific emphasis on the peptide pheromone α - factor and its receptor Ste2p . Part II of this dissertation is a study originally designed to probe inter - helical interaction between TM1 and TM7 of Ste2p . Site - directed mutagenesis and cysteine cross - linking with targeted residues of Ste2p were carried out . Although the anticipated inter - helical interactions were not identified from this study , the results provided strong evidence for Ste2p dimerization . Part III of this dissertation describes dimer interfaces including TM1 and TM7 of Ste2p . By using the disulfide iv cross - linking methodology , we studied the participation of specific residues at the intracellular boundary between TM1 and intracellular loop one and the entire TM7 in Ste2p dimerization . The final part of this dissertation contains a study of the participation of the Ste2p N - terminus in homo - dimer formation and the effect of ligand binding on this interaction . This part also includes overall conclusions and suggestions for future experiments that could contribute to an understanding of the dimer interfaces in Ste2p and the role of dimerization in the function of this receptor . v Table of Contents PART I GENERAL INTRODUCTION . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 CHAPTER 1 G P ROTEIN -

GPCRs consist of large and diverse gene families found in fungi , plants , and the animal kingdom . In humans , GPCRs comprise the largest superfamily of proteins with more than 1000 different GPCRs identified [ 2 ] . GPCRs are located at the cell surface and are responsible for the transduction of an extracellular stimulus into an intracellular response [ 3 ] . The endogenous ligands of GPCRs are extraordinarily diverse , including biogenic amines ( such as adrenaline , dopamine , histamine , and serotonin ) , peptide and protein hormones ( for example , angiotensin , bradykinin , endothelin , and melanocortin ) , peptide pheromones ( i . e . α - factor , a - factor of various fungal species ) , nucleosides and nucleotides ( adenosine , adenosine triphosphate , uridine triphosphate ) , and lipids and eicosanoids ( cannabinoids , leukotrienes , prostaglandins , and thromboxanes ) [ 4 ] . Furthermore , the awareness of exogenous signals , such as light , odor , and taste , is also mediated via GPCRs [ 5 , 6 ] Heterotrimeric G proteins are regulated by GPCRs upon ligand binding to receptors . G proteins are composed of three subunits ( α , βγ - dimer ) and each subunit plays important roles in determining the specificity and temporal characteristics of the cellular responses to signals [ 7 ] . Conformational change of receptor accompanied by activation of GPCRs lead to release of GDP followed by binding of GTP of G α - subunit 3 [ 1 ] . This change triggers the dissociation of the α - subunit from the receptor and the βγ - dimer . Both the GTP bound α - subunit and the released βγ - dimer can mediate the stimulation or inhibition of effector proteins such as enzymes and ion channels [ e . g , adenylate cyclase , guanylyl cyclase , phospholipase C , mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) , Ca + 2 , and K + channels ] . Thus , stimulation of GPCRs with specific agonists results in changes in the concentration of second - messenger molecules [ 1 ] Considering the wide variety of biological pathways regulated by GPCRs it is not unexpected that abnormal signaling by these receptors lead to disorders in tissues and organs in the human body [ 8 ] . Currently , GPCRs are ideal drug target for pharmaceutical companies due to the widespread physiological processes GPCRs mediated . Approximately 50 % of all modern prescription drugs and 25 % of the top - selling drugs directly or indirectly have an effect on GPCRs [ 3 , 6 , 9 ] ( Table 1 ) . However , only a very small portion of the known GPCRs represent targets of currently marketed drugs . Many GPCRs remain ‘orphan’ , which have not been assigned functions . Even for many receptors whose ligands are known , there is a need for identifying agonist and antagonist ligands . Regarding these facts , it is suggested that GPCRs will continue to be drug targets of the future [ 10 - 12 ] . Thus , the studies of GPCRs will contribute significantly to the understanding and treatment of a variety of diseases . Classification of GPCRs Despite the fact that various agonists stimulate the special GPCR family to activate diverse secondary - messenger pathways , GPCRs share structural similarities [ 13 ] . 4 Table 1 Examples of Top - selling GPCR drugs in 2005 Action Trade Name Molecular Entity Company Therapeutic Indication World Sales ( US $ millions ) H1 1 antagonist Allegra / Telfast Fexofenadine Sanofi - Aventis Allergies 1792 AT1 2 antagonist Diovan Valsartan Novartis Hypertension 2214 H2 3 antagonist Gaster Famotidine Yananouchi Gastric ulcer 656 5HT10 4 agonist Lmigran Sumatriptan GlaxosmithKline Migraine 1454 LH - RH 5 agonist Leuplin / Lupron Leuprorelin Takeda / Abbott Cancer 904 GABAb 6 agonist Neuronti n GABApentin Pfizer Neurological pain 2480 Β 1 agonist 7 Serevent Salmeterol GlaxosmithKline Asthma 679 Mixed 5HT2 8 / D1 9 / D2 10 antagonist Zyprexa Olanzapine Eli Lilly Schizophrenia 4905 Table modified from Jacoby et al [ 6 ] . 1 H1 , Histamin 1 receptor ; 2 AT1 , Angiotensin1 receptor ; 3 H2 , Histamin 2 receptor ; 4 5HT10 , Serotonin ( 5 - hydroxytryptamine , 5 - HT ) 10 receptor ; 5 LH - RH , Luteinizing hormone - releasing hormone receptor ; 6 GABAb , γ - Aminobutyric acid receptor ; 7 Β 1 , Bradykinin 1 receptor ; 8 5HT2 , Serotonin ( 5 - hydroxytryptamine , 5 - HT ) 2 receptor ; 9 D1 , Dopamine 1 receptor ; 10 D2 , Dopamine 2 receptor 5 All GPCRs contain seven transmembrane - spanning α - helical segments connected by alternating intracellular and extracellular loops ( IL and EL , respectively ) , with the amino terminus located on the extracellular side of the cytoplasmic membrane and the carboxy terminus on the intracellular side . Although GPCRs share common membrane topological features , sequence comparisons showed little or no similarities among the different GPCRs [ 14 ] and the size of the each domain vary such as extracellular N - terminal tails ( 7 - 600 amino acids ) , loop domains ( 5 - 230 amino acids ) , and C - terminal domains ( 12 - 360 amino acids ) which indicate diverse functions of GPCRs [ 7 ] . The GPCR superfamily has been classified into six different families . Each class has at least 20 % identity of their amino acid sequence within the TMs ( Transmembrane domains ) ( Table 2 ) [ 4 ] . The rhodopsin - like class A receptor is the most studied because it is easily obtainable in a purified form in large quantitites and it has the largest number of receptors . This class contains receptors for peptides , hormone peptide , odorants , small molecules such as the catecholamines and amines , and glycoprotein hormones ( Fig . 1 A ) [ 9 ] . Among class A receptors , peptide receptors are the largest subgroup and mediate important physiological roles of endogenous peptides that act as neurotransmitters and hormones . Class A receptors are characterized by a series of highly conserved key residues such as the DRY motif at the bottom of transmembrane domain ( TM ) 3 and the NPXXY motif in TM7 ( Fig . 1 A ) . Class B receptors are the next largest class including receptors for a variety of gastrointestinal peptide hormones ( secretin , glucagons , vasoactive intestinal peptide , and growth - hormone - releasing hormone ) , calcitonin , corticotrophin - releasing hormone and parathyroid hormone [ 1 ] . Class B receptors do not share any of the structural features characterizing class A receptors except for the 6 Table 2 Sequence - based groupings within the G - protein - coupled receptors 1 PTH , Parathyroid hormone receptor ; 2 PTHrP , Parathyroid hormone related peptide receptor ; 3 GABAb , γ - Aminobutyric acid receptor ( Modified from Flower et al [ 4 ] ) Class : A Rhodopsin - like receptors Family I Olfactory receptors , adenosine receptors , melanocortin receptors , and others Family II Biogenic amine receptors Family III Vertebrate opsins and neuropeptide receptors Family IV Invertebrate opsins Family V Chemokine , chemotactic , somatostatin , opioids and others Family VI Melatonin receptors and others Class B : Calcitonin and related receptors Family I Calcitonin and calcitonin - like receptors Family II PTH 1 / PTHrP 2 receptors Family III Glucagon , secretin receptors and others Family IV Latrotoxin receptors and others Class C : Metabotropic glutamate and related receptors Family I Metabotropic glutamate receptors Family II Calcium receptors Family II GABAb 3 receptors Family IV Putative pheromone receptors Class D : STE2 pheromone receptors Class E : STE3 pheromone receptors Class F : cAMP and archaebacterial opsin receptors 7 presence of a disulfide bridge between the first extracellular loop ( EL1 ) and second extracellular loop ( Fig . 1B ) . The most distinguishing characteristic of class B is that the amino terminus contains several cysteines , presumably forming a network of disulfide bridges [ 15 ] . The class C is relatively a smaller group , containing the metabotropic glutamate and γ - amino - butyric acid receptors , the calcium receptors , the vomeronasal , mammalian pheromone receptors , as well as some taste receptors [ 16 ] . All receptors in class C have a very large extracellular amino terminus ( 500 - 600 amino acids ) ( Fig . 1C ) that seems to be crucial for ligand binding and activation [ 17 , 18 ] . Class D is the STE2 yeast pheromone receptors , and class E is the STE3 yeast pheromone receptors . These two groups will be discussed in the next section ( Chapter 2 ) . Finally class F comprises the receptors that are related to slime mold cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) receptors and archaebacterial opsins . The tertiary structure of GPCRs Information about the tertiary structure of a GPCR is crucial for the understanding of its function and for the design of drugs to correct possible problems caused by failure of its function . Currently methods used to understand receptor structure and the interactions of the ligand with its receptor at the atomic level include X - ray crystallography , electron microscopy or diffraction , NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling . One of the advantages for NMR spectroscopy compared to the other methods is that dynamic information can be obtained . However , structural information requires high concentrations of dissolved pure protein . Except for several studies where single 8 helices were measured in a membrane , using solid state NMR , technical problems have precluded NMR studies from yielding structural information on GPCRs [ 19 ] . Currently , five crystal structures of GPCRs have been revealed ( Fig . 2 ) . The first crystal obtained was that rhodopsin resolved as a highly organized seven transmembrane bundle with 11 - cis - retinal , which is a key cofactor involved in maintaining rhodopsin in the ground state [ 20 ] . An interesting feature is that some of the transmembrane helices in rhodopsin are not regular α - helices [ 21 ] . The helices are bent around proline , one of the strongest distortion is at Pro267 in TM6 ( a highly conserved residue among GPCRs ) . It has been shown that mutations at this residue cause conformational changes on intracellular loop 3 [ 22 ] . In addition , a pronounced kink is observed in TM2 , caused by flexibility in the Gly - Gly sequence in the middle of this helix . The crystal structure also revealed a short 8 th helix , which runs parallel to the cytoplasmic membrane . This helix and the generated fourth cytoplasmic loop cover part of the binding site for the C - terminus of G t α subunit and play a role in G t γ binding . A set of residues including the 8 th helix on the cytoplasmic surface , where G protein activation occurs , likely to undergo a conformational change upon photoactivation of the chromophore that leads to G protein activation and signal transduction [ 21 ] . Several years after the rhodopsin structure was published , Kobilka and colleagues [ 23 - 25 ] published two different structures of the β 2 - adrenoceptor . Two initial structures of β 2 AR were crystallized , one was fused with T4 - lysozyme and another was bound with antagonist . Also crystal structure of β 2 AR was crystallized in a complex with an anti intracellular loop ( IL ) 3 , Fab fragment , at 3 . 5 Ǻ resolution . Both structures were similar indicating that the T4 lysozyme fusion had little effect on the structural properties of the 9 Figure 1 Classification of human GPCRs Class A GPCRs are characterized by several highly conserved amino acids in the TMs , and there is usually a disulfide bridge linking extracellular loops 1 and 2 . Most of the class A receptors have a palmitoylated cysteine residue in the intracellular C - terminal tail . The binding sites of the endogenous small - molecule hormone ligands of class A GPCRs are located within the 7 TM bundle ( A - 1 , the ligand binding site is indicated in orange ) . For peptide and glycoprotein hormone receptors ( A - 2 and A - 3 , respectively ) , binding occurs at the N terminus , the extracellular loop segments , and the extracellular parts of the TM helices . Class B GPCRs contain a relatively long N - terminal tail ( B ) . The class B receptors show a number of conserved proline residues within the TMs . The majority of class C receptors are characterized by very large N - and C - terminal tails , a disulfide bridge connecting the first and second extracellular loops , together with a very short and well - conserved third intracellular loop ( C ) . A number of the strongly conserved residues of class A GPCRs are also strongly conserved in class C GPCRs . The ligand binding site is located in the N - terminal domain , which is composed of the so - called venus flytrap ( VFT ) module that shares sequence similarity with bacterial periplasmic amino acid binding proteins . In all class C GPCRs except the GABAB receptor , a cysteine - rich domain ( CRD ) , which contains nine conserved cysteine residues , links the VFT to the 7 TM domain ( Modified from Jacoby et al [ 6 ] ) . 10 A - 1 A - 2 A - 3 B C 11 antagonist bound receptor . Soon afterward , an additional structure of β 2 AR - T4 - lysozyme , which had a stabilizing point mutation , E122W , was solved in complex with the inverse agonist timolol revealing a cholesterol - binding site [ 26 , 27 ] . Then , the turkey β 1 AR structure was solved in the presence of a strong antagonist cyanopindolo [ 28 ] . The overall structure was very similar to that of human β 2 AR with the exception of the second intracellular loop , a short helical segment in the turkey receptor whereas it was a random coil in human β 2 AR . The adenosine A 2a receptor structure was also solved in complex with the antagonist ZM241385 [ 29 ] . The adenosine structure showed a shifted ligand - binding site and even greater helical shifts relative to rhodopsin and β 2 AR . Then , a major breakthrough was made by Ernst and colleagues [ 30 , 31 ] . They published the crystal structure of light - activated opsin in complex with the C - terminal peptide corresponding G α subunit , transducin . Although the agonist was lacking in this structure , it may would be considered to be an active state of GPCR because of the bound C - terminal G α peptide [ 32 ] . Importantly , the structure demonstrated significant deviation from the inactive form of rhodopsin in the arrangement of the seven helical bundles . Compared to the rhodopsin structure , each GPCR crystal structure had similarities and differences [ 33 , 34 ] ( Fig . 2 ) . Sequence conservation among class A GPCRs is highest within the transmembrane regions . Thus , it is not surprising that the helical bundle orientation and packing is similar among the structures solved to date while the extracellular region of the β ARs is very open compared to rhodopsin . The most prominent feature is a short helical segment within extracellular loop ( EL ) 2 that is supported by limited interactions with EL1 and two disulfide bridges . The extracellular 12 region of the adenosine receptor is highly constrained by four disulfide bridges and multiple polar and van der Waals interactions among the three loops . The position of the antagonist - binding pocket varies significantly as a function of the receptor . The binding pocket of the β - adrenergic receptor is quite similar to that of rhodopsin , while the ligand binding pocket seems to be very different in the A2a adenosine structure . Based on sequence conservation and the initial bovine rhodopsin structure , it was considered that the DRY motif at the intracellular base of TM3 found in most class A GPCRs interact with a glutamate residue at the base of TM6 . However , looking at the structure of β 2 AR , β 1AR , A2a , this is unlikely . Ligand binding and receptor activation GPCRs are activated upon binding of ligand which is varied , ranging in size from small molecules to large glycoproteins . Many studies on receptor research are focused on identification of the binding domains for ligands , using genetic , biochemical , and biophysical approaches [ 13 ] . Site - directed or random mutagenesis of receptor , domain swapping , and use of labeled probes are the most commonly used methods for understanding structure - function relationship between GPCRs and their ligands . The binding sites of endogenous “small - molecule” ligands in class A receptors , such as for the retinal chromophore in rhodopsin and catecholamines in the adrenergic receptors are the most widely studied and well characterized of these receptor - binding domains [ 35 - 37 ] . Recent studies on several peptide receptors such as the receptors for angiotensin [ 38 - 40 ] , parathyroid hormone [ 41 , 42 ] , secretin [ 43 ] , bradykinin B2 [ 44 , 45 ] , gonadotropin - 13 releasing hormone [ 46 ] , opioids [ 47 , 48 ] , neurokinin ( NK ) [ 49 , 50 ] , vasopressin / oxytosin [ 51 - 53 ] , cholecystokin / gastrin [ 54 , 55 ] , and neurotensin 1 [ 56 ] supplied valuable information on the binding domains for other classes of GPCRs . Overall similarities are observed among ligands , although there are specific and various interactions between GPCRs and their cognate ligands . For example , large ligands , such as proteins , bind to extracellular loops , while small molecules , including pharmacological agents , bind within the transmembrane region of receptor ( Fig . 1 ) . On the other hand , peptides exhibit a combined binding mode ; they bind primarily to the extracellular loops while part of the ligand may penetrate into transmembrane region and interacts with residues buried in lipids [ 57 - 60 ] . Conformational Changes Involved in Agonist Induced GPCR Activation For a long time , there was a simple model that receptors were depicted as bimodal switches with inactive and active forms . However , a growing body of experimental evidence provided information that GPCR is dynamic and has many different conformations [ 61 , 62 ] . This newer model for GPCR activation is called multi - state model and suggests that the receptor alternate spontaneously between multiple active and inactive conformations [ 63 ] . Various GPCRs , for example 5 - HT 2 - serotonin receptors [ 64 ] α 2A - adrenoceptors [ 65 ] , AT 1 receptor [ 66 ] , gonadotropin - releasing hormone receptors [ 67 ] , µ - opioid receptors [ 68 ] and many others , have been studied with respect to different receptor conformations supporting the multi - state model . Today , it is commonly accepted that different ligands can induce different receptor conformations [ 69 ] and this , 14 Figure 2 Panel of Representative GPCRs Solved to Date Each group of receptors is represented by one structure ( same orientation ) . This figure highlights the observed differences seen in the extracellular and intracellular domains as well as the small differences seen in the ligand binding orientations .

Yellow represents bound lipids and green represents the conserved tryptophan residue . ( Adapted from Hanson and Stevens [ 33 ] ) 15 phenomenon has been described by several synonyms such as ‘functional selectivity ' , ‘agonist - directed trafficking ' or ‘biased agonism ' . Recently , it has been suggested that the number of different terms be limited by using the term ‘functional selectivity’ or ‘ligand - induced differential signalling’ to describe this phenomenon [ 70 ] . The term ‘efficacy’ is used to describe the effect of ligand on the functional properties of the receptor . Agonists are defined as ligands that fully activate the receptor . ‘Partial agonists’ induce submaximal activation of the G protein even at saturating concentrations . ‘Inverse agonist’ inhibits basal activity . Antagonists have no effect on basal activity , but competitively block the access of other ligands [ 70 ] . Intramolecualr interaction of TMs and TM movements during receptor activation The non - covalent interactions between TMs have an important role in determining the specific basal arrangement of the TM segments . For example , co - transfecting a plasmid encoding the amino terminus to TM5 of the β 2 adrenoceptor ( β 2 AR ) and a plasmid encoding TM6 to the carboxyl terminus of β 2 AR generates a functional ‘split’ receptor [ 71 ] . Also , in the M3 muscarinic receptor system , a functional receptor has been generated with discontinuity in the loop connecting TM3 and TM4 , the loop connecting TM4 and TM5 , and the loop connecting TM5 and TM6 [ 72 ] . In addition , analysis of the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin suggests that the inactive state conformation of rhodopsin is stabilized by multiple interhelical salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions [ 73 ] . There is a Schiff base formation between Glu113 in TM3 and Lys296 in TM7 of bovine rhodopsin in the resting state . Single point mutations of 16 Glu113 and Lys296 in bovine rhodopsin have been found to lead to constitutive receptor activity [ 74 , 75 ] . Site - directed mutagenesis experiments with bovine rhodopsin have demonstrated that a mutation of Gly 90 to Asp 90 in TM2 can substitute for Schiff base counterion Glu113 in TM3 [ 76 ] . Agonist binding is thought to alter the network of stabilizing intramolecular interactions to favor an active conformation . Figure 3 shows two possible ways how ligands might change intramolecular interactions and the arrangement of TM domains . First , agonists may induce a conformational change by simply disrupting intramolecular interactions ( Fig . 3a ) , thus favoring new interactions that stabilize the molecule . Second , agonists may serve as bridges to create new interactions between TM domains ( Fig . 3b ) . For example , catecholamines can interrupt the ionic lock of β 2 AR without interacting with amino acids directly involved in the ionic lock [ 77 ] . In rhodopsin , it was reported that TM6 undergoes the largest movement upon receptor activation and smaller changes were observed for TM3 [ 79 ] . Consistent with this , movements of TM3 and TM6 during agonist - induced conformational changes have been demonstrated in β - adrenoceptor [ 80 , 81 ] . The angiotensin AT 1 receptor also provides an example that Asn111 interacts with Asn295 in TM7 in the inactive state [ 82 ] , while Asn111 seems to interact with Tyr4 in the active state [ 83 ] . Therefore , agonist binding might disrupt the interaction between Asn111 and Asn295 . Consistent with this interpretation , mutation of Asn111 to alanine leads to constitutive activity [ 84 ] . M3 muscarinic receptor was also studied for intramolecular interactions . It was found that the cytoplasmic end of TM6 of this receptor undergoes a rotational movement [ 85 ] , and the distance between the cytoplasmic ends of TM1 and TM7 was increased during activation . 17 In contrast the extracellular ends of TM3 and TM7 move closer to each other upon agonist stimulation [ 86 , 87 ] . To gain information about the switch from an inactive conformation to active receptor conformation ( s ) , as a method for probing spatial proximity of residues in TMs , several different techniques such as site - directed spin labeling , sulfhydryl reactivity study , and fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) have been developed and used over the past decade . In addition , the disulfide cross - linking strategy has been applied to many GPCRs such as bovine rhodopsin [ 88 - 92 ] , M3 muscarinic receptor [ 85 , 87 ] , and Ste2p [ 93 ] . For example , a disulfide bridge was built successfully between Val204Cys in TM5 and Phe276Cys in TM6 of bovine rhodopsin [ 89 ] , which previously had been probed by metal ion site construction [ 94 ] and between Val223Cys in TM5 and Leu247Cys in TM6 of Ste2p [ 93 ] . Whereas numerous intramolecular constraints for inactive state conformations of GPCRs have been identified , much less is known about the intramolecular interactions stabilizing the active state conformations . The identification of intrahelical interactions will provide a molecular basis for understanding mechanistic information relating to GPCR activation pathways . In part II in this dissertation , the inter - helical interactions will be discussed in more detail . 18 Figure 3 Possible mechanisms how agonist binding disrupts intramolecular interactions that stabilize the inactive state ( a ) The agonist binds directly to amino acids involved in stabilizing the inactive state .

( Adapted from Kobilka and Deupi [ 78 ] ) 19 CHAPTER 2 α - factor pheromone and its G Protein - Coupled receptor ( Ste2p ) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae GPCRs in fungi Since the glucose / sugar sensor in yeast , Gpr1 , and homologs in other fungi are not included in the classical classification of GPCR , recently new classification system for fungal GPCRs have been proposed ( Table 3 ) . The GPCRs in fungi are categorized into six classes ; Ste2p - like pheromone receptor , Ste3p - like pheromone receptor , carbon / amino acid receptor , putative nutrient receptor , cAMP receptor - like , and microbial opsin [ 95 ] . The pheromone sensing GPCRs in fungi are well studied and many pheromone receptors have been identified based on conserved sequences and structures [ 95 ] . For example , in A . nidulans , GprA and GprB were identified as pheromone receptors based on sequence homology to Ste2 and Ste3 of S . cerevisiae [ 96 ] . In addition , it is surprising that the pheromone receptors were found to be expressed constitutively even in species which have no sexual cycle documented yet , such as Candida glabrata and Aspergillus fumigatus [ 97 - 99 ] . The conserved MAPK cascade based on the model established in S . cerevisiae has also been linked to morphogenesis and virulence in many fungal pathogens such as the rice blast fungus M . grisea , and the human pathogens C . albicans and C glabrata . [ 95 ] . 20 Table 3 Six classes of GPCRs in fungi Species Ste2 - like pheromone receptor Ste3 - like pheromone receptor Carbon / amino acid receptor Putative nutrient receptor cAMP receptor - like Microbial Opsin Ascomycetes Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ste2 Ste3 Gpr1 SCRG _ 01312 SCRG _ 02823 SCRG _ 00179 – – Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mam2 Map3 Git3 Stm1 – – Candida albicans Ste2 Ste3 Gpr1 CAWG _ 02899 CAWG _ 06059 CAWG _ 02686 – – Aspergillus nidulans GprA GprB GprC GprD GprE GprF GprG AN5720 GprH GprI AN8262 AN3361 Aspergillus fumigatus Afu3g14330 Afu5g07880 Afu7g04800 Afu5g04100 Afu1g06840 Afu1g11900 Afu3g01750 Afu5g04140 Afu3g00780 Afu7g01430 Neurospora crassa Pre - 2 Pre - 1 Gpr - 4 Gpr - 5 Gpr - 6 Gpr - 1 Gpr - 2 Gpr - 3 Nop - 1 ORP - 1 Magnaporthe grisea MGG _ 04711 MGG _ 06452 MGG _ 08803 MGG _ 04698 MGG _ 02855 MGG _ 06738 MGG _ 09015 Basidiomycetes Cryptococcus neoformans – Ste3 α / Ste3a Cpr2 Gpr4 Gpr2 Gpr3 Gpr4 Gpr5 CNAG _ 03572 ( Ops1 ) Ustilago maydis – Pra1 Pra2 – UM06006 UM01546 UM03423 UM02629 UM04125 Coprinopsis cinerea – Rcb1 Rcb2 Rcb3 CC1G _ 02129 – CC1G _ 07132 CC1G _ 04180 CC1G _ 02288 CC1G _ 02310 – - , no homolog has been identified . ( Modified from Xue et al [ 95 ] ) 21 α - factor Pheromone and its G Protein - coupled receptor ( Ste2p ) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae One of the challenges in GPCR research is the complexity of eukaryotic systems , due to the presence of receptor subtypes and cross - talk between different types of receptors regulating many different pathways . S . cerevisiae is a species of budding yeast which is most widely known as perhaps the most intensively studied eukaryotic model organism in molecular and cell biology . The S . cerevisiae α - factor receptor system has been used as an ideal system to understand GPCR structure - function as a model for peptide hormones [ 100 ] . The power of yeast genetics has been used to examine the structure – function relationship of α - factor receptor . The mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) system is simple but well conserved with higher eukaryotic systems . The S . cerevisiae has only three GPCRs , two pheromone receptors ( Ste2p and Ste3p ) and the Gpr1p which is a carbohydrate sensor . Although the pheromone and carbohydrate - sensing pathways share some down - stream components , there is no cross - talk between the two systems as the pheromone receptors and the Gpr1p couple to two different G - proteins ( Gpa1p and Gpa2p , respectively ) [ 101 , 102 ] . Thus S . cerevisiae provides an ideal system to study the relation between a peptide ligand and its GPCR in the absence of interfering biological complexities . Mating in yeast , Saccharomyces cerevisiae S . cerevisiae can exist as a haploid or diploid [ 103 , 104 ] . Haploid cells have two mating cell types MATa and MAT α , distinguished by the expression of a set of genes involved in mating that are not expressed in diploids . The secretion and reciprocal 22 detection of peptide pheromones ( α - factor and a - factor ) by GPCRs ( Ste2p and Ste3p , respectively ) initiate mating and eventual fusion of two haploids ( Fig . 4 ) [ 100 , 105 ] . The mating pheromones are essential to trigger the mating cycle , therefore the cells that cannot produce these molecules or lack their cognate receptors Ste2p or Ste3p become sterile . The tridecapeptide α - factor pheromone WHWLQLKPGQPMY peptide was chemically synthesized and found to exhibit all the properties of the natural pheromone [ 106 , 107 ] . The a - factor of S . cerevisiae is a dodecapeptide pheromone ( YIIKGVFWDPAC [ Farnesyl ] - OCH3 ) [ 108 ] , and post - translational modification with a farnesyl isoprenoid and carboxymethyl group is required for full biological activity of this peptide [ 109 ] . Pheromone binding to its GPCR and activation of the βγ subunit of G protein trigger the downstream MAPK cascade which activates the transcription of genes involved in the production of pheromone itself , pheromone receptor and the proteins of the signaling pathway ( Fig . 5 ) . The cells synthesize cell surface molecules necessary for fusion with their mating partners , arrest in the G1 phase of the growth cycle by eliminating the function of G1 cyclin complex and Cdc28 protein kinase to obtain synchrony for mating , form mating projections that are involved in the fusion process , thereby exhibiting a marked change in shape , and activate a number of genes that are necessary for sexual conjugation [ 110 , 111 ] . For long time , the G α subunit Gpa1 was known as a negative regulator . However , recently new evidence was reported that pheromone signaling is also positively transmitted via Gpa1 [ 112 ] . Also it was suggested that the GTP - bound form of Gpa1 can induce mating - specific transcription and 23 morphogenesis in the absence of pheromone , via binding to the phosphatidylinositol - 3 - kinase Vps34 [ 113 ] . The activation of cells by pheromone results in morphological changes . First , conjugation projections are formed to facilitate connection of two opposite mating type cells . By the action of agglutinins , the tips of the projections fuse forming a conjugation bridge . Next , the nuclei migrate into the bridge and subsequently fuse to produce a diploid nucleus of the zygote . All these morphological processes occur with an involvement of cytoskeletal components , i . e . , microtubules and actin structures , and the cell wall [ 114 ] . Many of these cellular responses have been used to measure the activity of this receptor and potency of pheromones and their analogs . Growth arrest ( Halo ) assay and β - galactosidase activity assay generated by a FUS1 - lacZ construct ( the FUS1 gene is transcriptionally activated by pheromone action ) are the examples of methods based on the cellular response . Regulation of Ste2p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and protein Signaling Ste2p is highly regulated by several control mechanisms like many other GPCRs . Among the general regulation mechanisms , three distinct processes contribute to α - factor receptor regulation . These are ( 1 ) rapid phosphorylation and desensitization [ 115 ] , ( 2 ) internalization and recycling [ 115 ] and ( 3 ) down - regulation and degradation [ 116 , 117 ] . The mating process in yeast is further regulated by the control of the expression levels or the activities of the downstream elements in the signaling pathway 24 Figure 4 Pheromone mediated mating in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Schematic representation of pheromone / receptor mediated communication between MAT a and MAT α haploid cells prior to mating . MAT a MAT α MAT a MAT α 25 Figure 5 Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating pathway Binding of pheromone to the receptor stimulates downstream responses such as transcriptional activation of pheromone - induced genes , cell - cycle arrest , and polarization of the cytoskeleton and growth components to the site of highest pheromone concentration . Receptor activation not only triggers the mitogen - activated protein kinase pathway ( light modules ) via G proteins ( spotted modules ) , it also involves the receptor carboxy - terminal domain . One model is that the carboxy - terminal domain , through direct or indirect interaction ( white circle ) with the polarity - establishment complex ( dark modules ) , stimulates the repolarization of the actin cytoskeleton ( speckled rectangle ) to the site of pheromone activation .

One of the well characterized regulators is Sst2p , a yeast homologue of regulators of G protein signaling ( RGS ) . RGS proteins are important negative regulators of GPCR signaling . They function as GTPase - accelerating proteins ( GAPs ) to inactivate G α by increasing the hydrolysis rate of GTP bound G α . After GTP hydrolysis , the G α subunit returns to its GDP - bound , then sequesters the G βγ complex into a heterotrimer , which lead to down regulation of G protein signaling . So far , 37 genes have been identified that encode proteins containing an RGS or RGS - like domain within the human genome [ 118 ] . Sst2p is the first RGS protein identified in S . cerevisiae . Recently it was found that Sst2p can directly bind to the C - terminal tail of Ste2p via its DEP domain . In addition , binding to the receptor places Sst2p in close proximity to Gpa1p , its substrate , implicating that regulation is both rapid and specific [ 119 ] . Additionally , the phosphatases Msg5p and Mpt5p have been reported that have a role in adaptive mechanism at higher concentrations of pheromone [ 120 ] . Expression of some proteases like Bar1p ( Sst1p ) , which specifically cleaves α - factor pheromone , adds to the complexity of the regulation of mating [ 121 ] . Structure - function analysis of α - factor pheromone The α - factor is a tridecapeptide secreted by MAT α cells and has the sequence WHWLQLKPGQPMY . Extensive analyses of α - factor analogs in combination with receptor mutagenesis have provided insights into the structural basis of α - factor activity [ 122 - 125 ] . Briefly , the results of these studies indicated that residues near the amine 28 terminus play an important role in receptor activation , the carboxyl terminus of the peptide contributes mostly to the binding affinity and the central residues of the peptide forms a β - turn around the Pro 8 - Gly 9 bond aiding the orientation of the signaling and the binding domains of the pheromone ( Fig . 6 ) [ 126 - 128 ] . A major experiment of this model of α - factor activity was the systematic Ala substitute creating α - factor analogs have been used to study the structure - function of the α - factor pheromone [ 129 ] . Several of the D - Ala series analogs , near the N - terminus , specifically [ D - Ala 2 ] α - factor , [ D - Ala 3 ] α - factor and [ D - Ala 4 ] α - factor had no measurable biological activity [ 129 ] . However , these peptides bound relatively strongly to Ste2p and antagonized the biological activity of wild type ligand . These results were consistent with previous studies showing that antagonists discovered involved changes in residues near the amine terminus indicating that residues near this region are important for signaling . In contrast , the residues at the carboxyl terminus of α - factor strongly affected to binding to Ste2p . Mutation of these residues by either L - or D - Ala decreased affinity up to 3000 - fold [ 129 ] . Removal of the carboxyl terminal residues resulted in pheromones with significantly decreased receptor affinity . Similar observations , separation of functional domains for binding and activity have been reported for other peptide receptors [ 130 - 133 ] . The Pro - Gly sequence is located at the central region of α - factor , which has a high probability of β - turns [ 134 , 135 ] . It was suggested that a turn at this position was involved in biological activity of the pheromone [ 136 ] and this region of the peptide may create of the proper overall conformation for the pheromone [ 129 ] . Considering the multi - state conformation of receptor , the separation of a binding domain and an activation domain of α - factor suggests that there is a sequential binding of the 29 pheromone to its receptor . The binding domain of α - factor may interact with the receptor first , then binding of the remaining domains may occur in a sequential manner . Consistent with this hypothesis , it was demonstrated that the fluorescent alpha - factor analogue [ K ( 7 ) ( NBD ) , Nle ( 12 ) ] bound to receptor via a two - step process involving an initial interaction that places the fluorophore in a hydrophobic environment , followed by a conversion to a state in which the fluorophore moves to a more polar environment [ 137 ] . One of the major goals of studies on GPCRs is understanding how ligands bind to their receptor and how this information is transferred to activation of intracellular pathway . Since yeast pheromones can be designed with chemically or photochemically active groups that promote crosslinking to the receptor , the yeast α - factor pheromone receptor was extensively used to study ligand binding . For example , a series of α - factor analogs containing p - benzoyl - L - phenylalanine ( Bpa ) , a photoactivatable group , were synthesized [ 138 ] . Chemical and enzymatic fragmentation of the receptor / radio probe complex ( [ Bpa1 , Tyr3 ( 125I ) , Arg7 , Phe13 ] α - factor - crosslinked - Ste2p ) indicated that cross - linking occurred on a portion of Ste2p spanning residues 251 - 294 which covers a portion of TM6 , the extracellular loop between TM6 and TM7 , and a portion of TM7 [ 138 ] . This was the first determination of a specific contact region between a Class D GPCR and its ligand . Later , analogues of α - factor containing Bpa and biotin as a tag , were synthesized to identify the pheromone binding site to receptor [ 139 ] . The study using Bpa ( 1 ) , Bpa ( 3 ) , and Bpa ( 13 ) ligand suggested that the N - terminus of the pheromone interacts with a binding domain consisting of residues from the extracellular ends of TM5 - TM7 and portions of EL2 and EL3 close to these TMs . It was also shown that there is a direct interaction between the position 13 side chain and a region of Ste2p 30 ( F55 - R58 ) at the extracellular end of TM1 in the same study [ 139 ] . In addition to the mutagenesis studies , chimeric receptors between S . cerevisiae and S . kluyveri α - factor receptors also supplied important information to understand the ligand receptor interaction ( s ) . A substitution at residues 47 - 49 of the the respective GPCRs affected specificity for the respective pheromone binding but not for activation . In contrast , substitution of residues 267 - 269 affected pheromone specificity for activation , but not for pheromone binding . Finally substitution of residues 104 - 123 modestly affected both types of specificity [ 140 , 141 ] . Later , it was revealed that the side chain of the tenth residue of α - factor is in close proximity with the side chains of residues 47 and / or 48 of Ste2p when the pheromone is bound to the receptor [ 142 ] . Also , our group suggested that portions of TM1 and TM6 were important for ligand interaction by using site - directed mutagenesis of Ste2p and binding assays with different α - factor analogs [ 143 ] Taking together , a model for α - factor bound to Ste2p was proposed ( Fig . 7 ) . The model places α - factor bent around the Pro - Gly center of the peptide with the Lys side chain facing away from the transmembrane domains and interacting with a binding pocket formed by the extracellular loops . The side chain of Gln10 is proximal to residues 47 and 48 near the extracellular side of TM1 , whereas the Trp1 side chain is near a pocket formed by TM6 - E3 - TM7 . Recently it was reported the Tyr13 side chain interacts with Cys59 of Ste2p at the extracellular end of TM1 [ 144 ] . 31 Figure 6 Functional domains of α - factor ligand Studies of α - factor analogs have revealed two regions according to their major contributions to activity and binding affinity . The residues at the N - terminus appeared to mainly function in activation of the receptor signaling , the residues at the C - terminus strongly contribute to the binding affinity . However the two functions cannot be completely separated . The loop domain corresponds to residues of the peptide which are thought to induce a bend in the ligand structure .

Recently , a vast range of studies have been documented that various classes of GPCRs form dimers and / or even higher order homo - oligomers [ 145 - 148 ] . Dimerization is thought to be important for various aspects of GPCR function such as receptor biogenesis , formation of ligand - binding sites , signal transduction , and down - regulation ( Table 4 ) . For example , the studies of DOP receptor dimerization by Cvejic and Devi ( 1997 ) [ 149 ] provided evidence that the addition of certain agonists would inhibit or reverse receptor dimerization . They concluded that the DOP receptor was likely internalized from the cell surface as a monomer in response to agonist challenge . It was reported that inhibition of dimer in β 2 - adrenoceptor by addition of a synthetic peptide corresponding to TM6 of the receptor limit agonist activation of adenylyl cyclase [ 150 ] . Thus , the study of dimerization has significance since abnormalities of dimer formation may alter the function of the receptors which results in serious disease . Indeed , many cases of dimerization is considered as a new drug targets [ 6 ] . However , specifically for G protein activation and signaling , it is not resolved whether a single GPCR molecule is sufficient or a dimer is necessary . Chabre and Maire argued that all GPCRs appear to act as monomer based on a re - assesssment of previous studies [ 151 ] while Park et al questioned the role and the existence of monomers in nature [ 152 ] . It was reported that the monomeric NTS1 receptor activates G q more 35 Table 4 Proposed roles of GPCR dimerization / oligomerization Role of dimerisation / oligomerisation Receptor ( s ) Protein folding β 2 - adrenoceptor CXCR1 1 α 2 - adrenoceptors TSH 2 receptor Frizzled 4 receptor Calcium sensing receptor Melacortin - 1 receptor Efficient signal transduction Rhodopsin BLT1 3 leukotriene B4 receptor 1 CXCR , chemokine receptor ; 2 TSH , thyrotropin receptor ; 3 BLT2 , leukotriene receptor ; ( Modified from Milligan [ 147 ] ) 36 efficiently than the receptor dimer in solubilized preparations [ 153 ] and monomeric rhodopsin activates transducin as fast as the rate of protein diffusion allows in detergent solution [ 22 ] . Also , rhodopsin monomers were found to activate transducin with the same efficiency as two rhodopsins in the same particle where receptors were reconstituted into lipid bilayer [ 154 ] . In contrast , it was reported that the higher - order rhodopsin oligomers are the most active species for transducin activation by using functional analyses of fractions from solubilized disk membranes [ 155 ] . Various transmembrane domains have been implicated to participate in receptor oligomerization in different receptor systems ( Table 5 ) suggesting that the structure of oligomers formed in different GPCRs may not be the same [ 147 ] . Even within the same receptor , homo - dimer formed by different monomer - monomer interaction from inactive state to activate state [ 156 ] . The studies on class C receptors provide valuable information that the N - terminal region may also participate into oligomerization as well as transmembrane domains . The N - terminal Venus flytrap ( VFT ) module is one of main characteristic for class C receptors , which is structurally and functionally homologous to bacterial periplasmic proteins that bind amino acids , sugars and ions [ 157 ] . It was reported that VFTs are important for dimerization of this receptor class [ 158 , 159 , and 160 ] . Additionally , it is known that cysteine - rich domains ( CRDs ) , localized between VFT and transmembrane domains , also have dimerization potential . It was demonstrated that VFT – CRD modules form disulfide - linked dimers even when expressed without the rest of the receptor from the mGlu 1 , mGlu 4 and calcium - sensing ( CaS ) receptors [ 161 - 163 ] . 37 Table 5 Structural domains reported to be involved in GPCR dimerization / oligomerization 1 TM = transmembrane domain ( Modified from Milligan [ 147 ] ) Receptor Implicated domains Rhodopsin TM 1 4 , 5 Dopamine D2 TM 4 α 1b - adrenoceptor TM 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 Complement C5a TM 1 , 2 , 4 Adenosine A2a TM 5 β 2 - adrenoceptor TM 6 38 To directly examine the physical interaction between two GPCRs , differential epitope tagging and selective immunoprecipitation have been valuable tools . Cysteine cross linking has also used to detect dimers / oligomers . In addition , a variety of reagents to cross - link two molecules have been employed [ 164 , 165 ] . In order to address whether GPCR dimers exist in living cells , biophysical techniques such as bioluminescence resonance energy transfer , fluorescence resonance energy transfer have been employed to visualize dimers / oligomers . In the part III of this dissertation , the cysteine cross - linking method will be discussed in detail . Dimer - / Oligomerization of Ste2p Ste2p also can form a dimer . Two independent studies demonstrated that co - expression of an endocytosis - defective mutant with the wild - type receptor leads to efficient internalization of the mutant receptor , suggesting that these receptors are internalized as dimers [ 166 , 167 ] . Overton and Blumer used fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) between differentially tagged receptors in whole cells as an indicator for dimerization . They showed that tagged receptors lacking an endocytosis signal were able to undergo endocytosis when co - expressed with wild - type receptor . They also found the efficiencies of FRET were indistinguishable with agonist and antagonist by dose - response and time - course experiments , thus Ste2p appeared to be dimeric in the absence or presence of agonist . Using either whole cell or membrane preparation yielded a similar FRET ratio [ 166 , 167 ] . The study by Yesilaltay et al also indicated that dimerized receptor complexes were subject to endocytosis and unoccupied 39 receptors could also be internalized . In addition , they found that intermolecular disulfide bonds between two intrinsic cysteines in Ste2p ( C59 and C252 ) were unnecessary for dimer formation [ 166 , 167 ] . Overton and Blumer also used FRET to identify domains of Ste2p that mediated dimerization and found TM1 was important for dimer formation . Various combinations of receptor TM fragments were expressed with YFP or CFP taggs and FRET ratios were measured . The major conclusion of the study was that TM1 has a significant role in dimerization and is possibly involved help from the N - terminal extracellular domain and TM2 to stabilize the dimer formation [ 168 ] . In a later study , it was also reported the GXXXG motif in TM1 was involved in dimerization . Mutation of this motif of Ste2p did not affect ligand binding but decreased cell signaling , indicating that dimerization is not involved in ligand binding but is important for signal transduction [ 169 ] . It was also suggested that the dimer of Ste2p functioned in a concerted fashion . Two different mutants , which were defective in promoting G protein activation were co - expressed and the ability to form a dimer in vivo and to correct their signaling were measured , resulting in increasing signaling significantly [ 170 ] . Analysis of dominant - negative mutants of the receptor also suggests that dimerization may be important for signal transduction . A dimer receptor formed between WT Ste2p and its dominant negative mutant ( Ste2p - Y266C ) failed to signal , further supporting the idea that one role for dimerization of Ste2p is efficient signaling [ 171 ] . Recently , receptors in other yeast species were found to have dimer forms that may mediate important physiological functions of GPCRs in fungi . For example , the S . pombe pheromone receptor Mam2 was found to form dimers during a study of a 40 constitutively active mutant [ 172 ] . In C . neoformans , domains of Gpr4 were shown to interact with another Gpr4 in a yeast two hybrid system [ 173 ] . These studies suggest that dimerization is a common phenomenon in fungi similar to GPCRs in other systems . In the part III of this dissertation , identification of dimer interfaces of Ste2p will be discussed in detail . 41 List of References for Part I 1 . Pierce , K . L . , R . T . Premont , and R . J .

Today , it is widely believed that receptors undergo conformational change ( s ) involving rearrangement of transmembrane domains ( TMs ) upon ligand binding . In this study , 36 different combinations of double Cys mutants were made by pairing six mutations on TM1 ( L64 – M69 ) with six on TM7 ( L289 – M294 ) . Although no inter - helical interactions were found with the targeted residues under the experimental condition used , the results provided strong evidence for Ste2p homo - dimerization . 64 CHAPTER 2 Introduction For about a decade from 1980 to 1990 , the model for GPCR activation was proposed to be a simple bimodal conversion between inactive and active states . However , studies with various GPCRs , such as 5 - HT 2 - serotonin receptors [ 1 ] , α 2A - adrenoceptors [ 2 ] , AT 1 receptor [ 3 ] , gonadotropin - releasing hormone receptors [ 4 ] , and µ - opioid receptors [ 5 ] showed that a receptor can exist in several different conformations , suggesting a multi - state model . The multi - state model for GPCR activation proposes that the receptor alternates spontaneously between multiple active and inactive conformations [ 6 ] . Today , it is widely believed that different ligands can induce different receptor conformations [ 7 ] . Although the intracellular and extracellular loop regions play a role in receptor activation , the non - covalent interactions between TMs seem to predominate for determining the specific basal arrangement of the TM segments [ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ] and agonist binding is thought to change the inter - helical interaction between TMs potentially leading to multiple receptor conformations . In the rhodopsin system , it was reported that TM6 undergoes large movements upon receptor activation and smaller changes were observed for TM3 [ 14 ] . Consistent with this , movements of TM3 and TM6 during agonist - induced conformational changes have been demonstrated in the β - adrenoceptor [ 15 , 16 ] . The M3 muscarinic receptor is also used for studies of intramolecular interactions . It was found that the cytoplasmic end of TM6 of this receptor undergoes a rotational movement [ 17 ] , and the distance between the cytoplasmic ends of TM1 and TM7 was increased during activation . In contrast the extracellular ends of TM3 and TM7 65 move closer to each other upon agonist binding in the M3 muscarinic receptor [ 18 , 19 ] . As a method to detect interactions between residues in TMs , several different techniques , such as site - directed spin labeling , sulfhydryl reactivity studies , and disulfide cross - linking strategies have been developed and used extensively [ 20 - 24 ] . In Ste2p , residues and regions in transmembrane domains involved in receptor activation and signaling have been studied extensively [ 25 - 27 ] . For example , the studies of dominant - negative mutations in the receptor indicate that most mutants exhibiting a dominant - negative phenotype are located on the extracellular ends of the transmembrane domains , especially TM5 and TM6 [ 28 - 30 ] . In addition , an interaction between Val223Cys in the intracellular part of TM5 and L247C in the intracellular part of TM6 of Ste2p has been identified by a cysteine - cross - linking experiment [ 25 ] . It was also suggested that F204 in extracellular loop 2 was important for ligand binding and Y266 at the extracellular end of TM6 was involved in signal transduction [ 31 ] . Consistent with this , Yong et al revealed that N205 in TM5 is critical for signal transduction and interacts with Y266 in a constitutively active receptor [ 32 ] . Whereas numerous intra - molecular restraints for the inactive state conformations of GPCRs have been identified , little is known about the actual difference between the inactive and active states at the molecular level . The identification of inter - helical interactions specific to each state will provide a molecular basis for understanding mechanistic information underlying GPCR activation pathways . To identify inter - helical interactions between TM1 and TM7 , we employed cysteine cross - linking . Although the anticipated inter - helical interactions were not identified from this study , the results 66 provided strong evidence for Ste2p dimerization which will be discussed in depth in PART III of this dissertation . 67 CHAPTER 3 Experimental procedures Strains , Media , and Plasmids Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain LM102 described by Sen and Marsh [ 33 ] was used in the growth arrest and LacZ assays . The genotype for the LM102 strain is : MAT a , bar1 , his4 , leu2 , trp1 , met1 , ura3 , FUS1 - lacZ : : URA3 , ste2 - dl ( deleted for the α - factor receptor ) . The protease - deficient strain BJS21 ( MAT a , prc1 - 407 prb1 - 1122 pep4 - 3 leu2 trp1 ura3 - 52 ste2 : : Kan R ) was used in disulfide cross - linking and western blot assays to decrease receptor degradation during analyses [ 34 ] . The parental plasmid , pHY4 expressing the template construct used for mutagenesis , FT - HT - Xa ( cys - less Ste2p , the FLAG and His epitope tags with Factor Xa cleavage cite ) was generated by introducing a tandem Factor Xa cleavage site between Val192 and Thr193 into pBec2 expressing FT - HT ( FLAG and His tagged Cys - less Ste2p ) under a constitutive GPD promoter [ 35 ] . Twelve single Cys mutations ranging from Leu 64 through Met 69 on TM1 and Leu 289 through Met 294 on TM7 were generated in the pHY4 background by PCR based site - directed mutagenesis [ 36 ] . The sequences of constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis completed by the Molecular Biology Resource Facility located on the campus of the University of Tennessee . Primers were purchased from Sigma Genosys or IDT ( Coralville , IA ) . After sequence confirmation , constructs were transformed into the ste2 - deletion strains LM102 and BJS21 by the method of Gietz et al [ 37 ] . Transformants bearing the pHY4 constructs were selected by their growth in the absence of tryptophan on MLT medium ( Medium lacking tryptophan ) [ 38 ] . All media components were obtained from Difco . 68 Growth Arrest ( Halo ) Assay Growth arrest was measured as described previously [ 32 ] . Briefly , filter disks were impregnated with 10 - µ l portions of peptide solutions at various concentrations and placed onto the overlay containing S . cerevisiae LM102 cells . The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 24 - 36 h and then observed for clear zones ( halos ) around the disks . The halo measured included the diameter of the disc . The normalized activity of each mutant was determined by comparing halo size for the FT - HT - Xa receptor at 2µg of α - factor . All assays were carried out at least three times with no more than a 2 - mm variation in halo size at a particular amount applied for α - factor . FUS1 - lacZ Gene Induction Assay S . cerevisiae LM102 contains a FUS1 - lacZ gene that is inducible by mating pheromone . Cells were grown overnight in SD ( synthetic defined ) medium [ Yeast nitrogen base medium ( Difco ) without aminoacid ] supplemented with the required amino acids at 30 °C to 5 x 10 6 cells / ml , washed by centrifugation , and grown for one doubling ( hemocytometer count ) at 30 °C . Induction was performed by adding 10 - 6 M of α - factor to 1 ml of concentrated cells ( 1 x 10 7 cells / ml ) . The mixtures were vortexed and , after incubation at 30 °C with shaking for 2 h , cells were harvested by centrifugation , and each pellet was resuspended and assayed for β - galactosidase activity ( expressed as Miller units ) in duplicate by using a β - galactosidase assay kit ( Pierce ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . The activity of each mutant was normalized by comparing β - 69 galactosidase activity for the wild - type strain . The standard deviation was determined from three independent experiments . Preparation of membranes Membrane preparation of Ste2p was carried out essentially as described previously [ 32 ] . Cells were grown to log phase , and then 1 x 10 8 cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by agitation with glass beads in a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 10 µ g / ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 2 µ g / ml leupeptin , and 2 µ g / ml pepstatin . The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 2 , 000 x g for 5 min , and then membranes were harvested by centrifugation at 15 , 000 x g for 45 min . The membrane pellet was washed and then resuspended in 100 µ l of a buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) containing 10 % glycerol , 50mM Hepes , 0 . 15mM NaCl , 2mM CaCl 2 , 5mM KCl , 5mM MgCl 2 , 4mM EDTA [ 32 ] . The protein concentration was determined by the Lowry assay ( Pierce ) , and the membrane preparation was stored at - 20 ºC overnight and used for further assay the next day . Disulfide Cross - linking with Cu - Phenanthroline The 100 µ g of membrane protein preparation was treated with a fresh preparation of Cu ( II ) - 1 , 10 - phenanthroline ( CuP ; final concentration , 2 . 5 µM CuSO4 and 7 . 5µM phenanthroline , pH 7 . 4 ) . The treatment was carried out at room temperature for 30 min , terminated with 50 mM EDTA and kept on ice for 20 min followed by adding Laemmli sample buffer . 70 Factor Xa digestion The membrane protein preparation ( 40 µg ) was incubated with 0 . 4 unit of Factor Xa ( Novagen ) in Factor Xa cleavage buffer ( 0 . 1M NaCl , 50 mM Tris - HCl , 5 mM CaCl 2 , pH 8 . 0 ) containing 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 30min . Each sample was divided into two aliquots . The reactions were terminated by adding one - third the volume of Laemmli sample buffer ( 30 % glycerol , 3 % SDS , 0 . 01 % bromphenol blue , 0 . 1875 M Tris , pH 6 . 8 ) . To one aliquot β - mercaptoethanol ( final 1 % , v / v ) was added for reducing conditions . Samples were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting . Western blot Immunoblot analysis of Ste2p was carried out as described previously [ 32 ] . Each sample was incubated at room temperature and then separated on NuPAGE 10 % Bis - Tris SDS - polyacrylamide gel ( Invitrogen ) using either non - reducing or reducing conditions and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon TM - P membrane ( Millipore Corp . , Bedford , MA ) . The blot was probed with anti - FLAG M2 antibody ( Eastman Kodak Co . ) or 1D4 antibody ( a monoclonal antibody for rho - tag , purchased from Flintbox , BC , Canada ) , and the bands were visualized with the West Pico chemiluminescent detection system ( Pierce ) . 71 CHAPTER 4 Results Expression and Biological Activities of Double Cys Mutant Receptors To identify a possible inter - helical interaction between TM1 and TM7 , 36 different combinations of double Cys mutants were made by pairing the six mutations on TM1 with six on TM7 . We chose twelve residues , six in TM1 ( L64 – M69 ) and six in TM7 ( L289 – M294 ) proximal to the cytoplasmic face of Ste2p ( Fig . 8A ) for mutation to Cys ( Fig . 8A ) . These targeted residues were chosen for these reasons : ( i ) TM7 residues mutated ( L291 – M294 ) are highly conserved among fungal pheromone receptors [ 39 ] , ( ii ) TM1 and TM7 are in close proximity to one another in crystal structures of GPCRs [ 40 , 41 ] and a model of Ste2p [ 39 ] . To eliminate non - specific cross - linking the template for these mutations was a Cys - less receptor . This template ( FT - HT - Xa ) also contained two C - terminal epitope tags ( FLAG and 6XHis ) and tandem Factor Xa cleavage sites ( IEGRIEGR ) in the second extracellular domain in order to facilitate detection of inter - domain cross - linking ( Fig . 8A ) . Native Ste2p , FT - HT ( Cys - less Ste2p with the FLAG and His epitope tags ) and FT - HT - Xa ( the template construct ) receptors used in this study demonstrated almost identical biological activities in a growth arrest assay indicating that incorporating the protease site and the epitope tags did not alter receptor function ( Fig . 8B ) . The biological activities of the double Cys mutant receptors were measured and the results were summarized in Table 6 . Most double mutant receptors showed similar 72 Figure 8 A . The two - dimensional topology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ste2p and B . Dose - response analysis of growth arrest assay A . The cartoon indicates the location of the genetically engineered Factor Xa digestion site in EL2 and the epitope tags in the C - terminus . The two endogenous Cys residues ( C59 and C252 ) were mutated to Ser to generate FT - HT - Xa which was the parental plasmid used to generate the cysteine mutations in positions 64 to 69 in TM1 and 289 to 294 in TM7 as indicated in the boxes . The zone of growth inhibition of strains carrying the indicated receptors was measured at various concentrations of α - factor . FT - HT - Xa is the Cys - less receptor containing C - terminal FLAG and His epitope tags and a tandem Factor Xa digestion site in EL2 . FT - HT is the Cys - less receptor without the Xa digestion site containing the FLAG and His epitopes , and Native Ste2p is the wild - type receptor that has no epitope tags and has two Cys residues ( C59 and C252 ) . 73 A L289C P290C L291C S292C S293C M294C ×× NH2 COOH FLAG / His ( 6 ) Factor Xa cleavage sites ( IEGR ) 2 TM7 TM1 L64C T65C L66C I67C V68C M69C B Halo assay - 1 . 0 - 0 . 5 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 Native Ste2p FT - HT FT - HT - Xa Log a - factor ( mg ) H a l o s i z e ( mm ) 74 Table 6 Biological Activities of double Cys mutants LacZ Activity Basal 1 Induced 2 Halo Activity 3 FT - HT - Xa 1 . 0 ± 0 . 08 ( 3 . 7 unit ) 1 . 0 ± 0 . 23 ( 32 unit ) 1 ( 24mm ) L64C L289C 1 . 0 ± 0 . 13 1 . 0 ± 0 . 14 0 . 89 T65C L289C 1 . 0 ± 0 . 09 0 . 8 ± 0 . 03 0 . 92 L66C L289C 1 . 0 ± 0 . 09 0 . 8 ± 0 . 05 1 . 11 I67C L289C 1 . 1 ± 0 . 13 0 . 7 ± 0 . 04 1 . 03 V68C L289C 1 . 3 ± 0 . 16 0 . 8 ± 0 . 09 0 . 97 M69C L289C 1 . 0 ± 0 . 08 0 . 8 ± 0 . 08 1 . 03 L64C P290C 1 . 9 ± 0 . 16 1 . 0 ± 0 . 01 0 . 98 T65C P290C 1 . 9 ± 0 . 11 1 . 0 ± 0 . 02 0 . 98 L66C P290C 1 . 9 ± 0 . 15 0 . 9 ± 0 . 02 1 . 07 I67C P290C 2 . 9 ± 0 . 15 0 . 9 ± 0 . 01 1 . 05 V68C P290C 2 . 4 ± 0 . 27 1 . 0 ± 0 . 04 1 . 16 M69C P290C 1 . 7 ± 0 . 17 0 . 8 ± 0 . 03 1 . 02 L64C L291C 1 . 1 ± 0 . 04 1 . 7 ± 0 . 08 0 . 71 T65C L291C 1 . 2 ± 0 . 02 0 . 5 ± 0 . 06 0 . 00 L66C L291C 1 . 0 ± 0 . 01 1 . 0 ± 0 . 05 0 . 76 I67C L291C 1 . 5 ± 0 . 05 1 . 4 ± 0 . 06 1 . 03 V68C L291C 1 . 1 ± 0 . 03 0 . 5 ± 0 . 07 0 . 00 M69C L291C 1 . 0 ± 0 . 08 1 . 0 ± 0 . 05 0 . 98 L64C S292C 0 . 9 ± 0 . 09 1 . 0 ± 0 . 02 0 . 76 T65C S292C 0 . 9 ± 0 . 08 1 . 0 ± 0 . 09 0 . 84 L66C S292C 1 . 0 ± 0 . 12 1 . 4 ± 0 . 07 0 . 89 I67C S292C 0 . 8 ± 0 . 03 1 . 1 ± 0 . 16 0 . 97 V68C S292C 0 . 9 ± 0 . 05 0 . 9 ± 0 . 06 0 . 00 M69C S292C 0 . 7 ± 0 . 01 1 . 0 ± 0 . 03 1 . 05 L64C S293C 0 . 9 ± 0 . 03 1 . 0 ± 0 . 05 1 . 05 T65C S293C 1 . 2 ± 0 . 03 1 . 1 ± 0 . 03 1 . 08 L66C S293C 1 . 3 ± 0 . 03 1 . 1 ± 0 . 02 1 . 05 I67C S293C 1 . 1 ± 0 . 05 1 . 0 ± 0 . 07 1 . 10 V68C S293C 1 . 2 ± 0 . 05 1 . 2 ± 0 . 11 1 . 10 M69C S293C 1 . 1 ± 0 . 02 2 . 1 ± 0 . 04 0 . 90 L64C M294C 1 . 1 ± 0 . 04 1 . 1 ± 0 . 01 1 . 08 T65C M294C 1 . 1 ± 0 . 05 1 . 3 ± 0 . 01 1 . 15 L66C M294C 0 . 9 ± 0 . 03 1 . 1 ± 0 . 04 1 . 10 I67C M294C 0 . 9 ± 0 . 02 1 . 0 ± 0 . 02 1 . 00 V68C M294C 1 . 0 ± 0 . 08 0 . 5 ± 0 . 00 0 . 00 M69C M294C 1 . 1 ± 0 . 06 0 . 5 ± 0 . 05 0 . 00 1 Relative activity ( ±standard deviation ) compared with basal activity of FT - HT - Xa 75 ( Table 6 continued ) 2 Relative activity ( ±standard deviation ) compared with induced activity of FT - HT - Xa ( α - factor , 1µM ) 3 Relative halo size compared with given halo size by FT - HT - Xa at 2 µ g of α - factor .

Moreover , the halo assay was used to measure the long term effect of receptor activation [ 42 , 43 ] . For example , it is possible that conformational change introduced by specific mutations could alter coupling of the receptor with G protein or influence endocytosis of the mutant receptor such that it cannot efficiently arrest cell division . The expression level of all double mutant receptors was similar to that of the FT - HT - Xa receptor ( Representative data , Fig . 9 ) . The multiple bands on immubolots are typical of Ste2p expression and are due probably to differences in the glycosylation state receptor , which does not influence receptor function [ 44 ] . Taken together , we conclude that Cys mutation of the targeted residues did not severely interfere with receptor expression and function , with the specific exception of the five mutants ( T65C / L291C , V68C / L291C , V68C / S292C , V68C / M294C and M69C / M294C ) indicated above . Identification of Inter - molecular interaction between TMs using Factor Xa digestion To identify inter - molecular interaction between TM1 and TM7 , Factor Xa digestion was used . The Factor Xa digestion site was engineered into EL2 . Digestion with Factor Xa cuts the intact receptor approximately in half . Therefore , if there is any interaction between TM1 and TM7 , the disulfide bond formed between the residues will hold the receptor halves together following Factor Xa digestion ( Fig . 10A ) and a receptor of intact size ( 55 kDa ) would be detected by anti - FLAG antibody on an immunoblot of 77 Figure 9 Expression of double Cys mutant receptors Total membrane preparation from cells expressing each mutant receptor was analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Receptor was detected by anti - FLAG antibody . The upper band ( ~ 110 kDa ) represents dimerized receptor and the lower band ( ~ 55 kDa ) represents monomer .

Under reducing gel conditions , this band would disappear and a smaller band corresponding to the C - terminal half of the receptor would be detected by anti - epitope antibodies engineered into the C - terminus ( Fig . 10A and B ) . Before each double Cys mutant was tested , various parameters were examined to optimize the experimental conditions . Figure 11A shows the optimal concentration of Factor Xa for receptor cutting is between 0 . 4 and 1 . 6 unit for one hour incubation at 4 ºC . As expected , the C - terminal fragment of the receptor after protease digestion was detected at approximately 33 kDa using anti - FLAG antibody ( Fig . 11A ) . An anti - Ste2p antibody , which recognizes the first 100 amino acids of the receptor , also successfully detected the N - terminal fragment of the receptor ( 22 kDa ) following digestion . Multiple bands around 22 kDa ( Fig 11B ) are due to differences in glycosylation state as observed for the intact receptor . All double Cys mutant receptors were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and western blot after Factor Xa digestion . However , no intra - molecular interaction between TM1 and TM7 was detected between the targeted residues . Instead , a band corresponding to a 66kD protein fragment ( indicated by an arrow ) was detected in double Cys mutant combinations involving five TM7 residues ( L289C , L291C , S292C , S293C and M294C ) ( representative data for L291C and S293C shown in Fig . 12A and B ) . However , when an additional Cys mutation was made at P290 with the same mutations of TM1 , the 66 kDa band was not generated ( Fig . 12C ) . These data indicate that for specific residues in TM7 , mutation to cysteine supports the formation of TM7 - TM7 dimers . Interestingly , this band was detected only under non - reducing condition , and disappeared under reducing conditions . The size of the this novel 66 kDa corresponds to a dimer formed from two 79 fragments of C - terminal half of Ste2p joined by a disulfide bond , as would be expected to occur following Factor Xa digestion of a TM7 - TM7 dimer . The fact that this band was not detected under reducing conditions supports the idea that this band was generated from cysteine cross linking . To test this , Cu ( II ) - 1 , 10 - phenanthroline ( Cu - P ) was used to treat all double Cys mutants to promote Cys - Cys disulfide bond formation . A protein band around 110 kDa was expected if Ste2p formed dimers through the engineered Cys residues in TM7 . Indeed most of double cys mutants increased dimer population upon Cu - P treatment . Double mutants expressing the P290C mutation did not show an increase in dimerization , with the exception of I67C / P290C and V68C / P290C ( Fig . 13 ) . These results strongly suggested that Ste2p forms homo - dimers through introduced cysteines and led us to make single Cys mutants and further examine the capacity of these mutants to form dimers . This will be discussed in Part III in detail . 80 Figure 10 2D diagram illustrated expected result for interaction A .

This method has been extensively used to detect helical interactions in several GPCR systems [ 17 , 23 , 45 - 47 ] . Since our lab previously observed cysteine cross linking between N205C and Y266C without the use of an oxidizing reagent [ 32 ] , we also expected to identify any interactions in TM1 and TM7 without using oxidizing reagents . However , no inter helical interactions were found with the targeted residues under the experimental condition used . It is possible that the intracellular parts of TM1 and TM7 in Ste2p are not close enough to interact , or the side chains of the targeted residues are not in the optimal orientation to form disulfide bonds , even though TM1 and TM7 are supposedly in close proximity according to established models . In contrast , we found evidence for homo - dimerization of Ste2p involving TM1 and / or TM7 which is discussed in detail in the next part of the dissertation . Interestingly , the expression level of the single Cys mutant P290C is very much lower than for the FT - HT - Xa and Cys mutants at other positions ( Fig . 15 in Part III ) . However , double cys mutants with P290C showed better expression ( Fig . 9 ) . Even though we could not detect any intra - molecular interaction between TM1 and TM7 with the residues targeted in this study , the fact that adding another cysteine mutation on TM1 compensates for the expression defect of P290C indicates TM1 and TM7 may somehow interact at the intra - molecular or inter - molecular level . In addition , double Cys mutant containing P290C did not produce the 66 kDa band observed for the other double Cys 86 mutants . This suggests that P290C may be important to maintain the proper conformation of TM7 to allow for the formation of disulfide bonds between the surrounding TM7 residues ( L289C , L291C , S292C , S293C and M294C ) . Taken together , the results suggests that Pro 290 plays a critical role in receptor dimerization . Based on the results which will be presented in part III of this dissertation , the region of TM7 we chose to examine for potential interhelical interactions may not conform to the typical structure of a transmembrane α - helix , as this portion of TM7 may be distended and flexible , making it available for interaction with an adjacent receptor . 87 List of References for Part II 1 .

Becker in Biochemistry 2009 Oct 28 . [ Epub ahead of print ] ] 94 CHAPTER 1 Abstract The S . cerevisiae α - factor pheromone receptor , Ste2p , has been studied as a model for G protein - coupled receptor ( GPCR ) structure and function . Dimerization has been demonstrated for many GPCRs , although the role ( s ) of dimerization in receptor function is disputed . Transmembrane domains one ( TM1 ) and four ( TM4 ) of Ste2p were shown previously to play a role in dimerization . In this study , single cysteine substitutions were introduced into a Cys - less Ste2p , and disulfide - mediated dimerization was assessed . Six residues in TM1 ( L64 to M69 ) that had not been previously investigated and nineteen residues in TM7 ( T278 to A296 ) of which fifteen were not previously investigated were mutated to create 25 single Cys - containing Ste2p molecules . Ste2p mutants V68C in TM1 and nine mutants in TM7 ( cysteine substituted into residues 278 , 285 , 289 , and 291 to 296 ) showed increased dimerization upon addition of an oxidizing agent in comparison to the background dimers formed by the Cys - less receptor . The formation of dimers was decreased for TM7 mutant receptors in the presence of α - factor indicating that ligand binding resulted in a conformational change that influenced dimerization . The effect of ligand on dimer formation suggests that dimers are formed in the resting state and the activated state of the receptor by different TM interactions . 95 CHAPTER 2 Introduction G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) are membrane proteins that form one of the largest and most diverse families of proteins in eukaryotes ranging from yeast to human . Though the primary sequences are different among the GPCRs , all GPCRs share common structural features : seven transmembrane helical domains ( TMs ) across the lipid bilayer , with the TMs connected by intracellular and extracellular loops , an extracellular N - terminus and an intracellular C - terminus [ 1 ] . GPCRs mediate responses to various stimuli such as hormones , odors , peptides and neurotransmitters . Binding of ligand to a GPCR triggers receptor - specific signals through a heterotrimeric G protein . Since it has been reported that genetic variation of GPCRs often alters receptor functions such as ligand binding , G protein coupling , and receptor life cycle , GPCR mutation is considered a causative agent of many of human diseases [ 2 ] . GPCRs have been the most successful molecular drug targets in clinical medicine [ 3 ] . Ste2p is the α - factor pheromone receptor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and has been used as a model for the study of the molecular basis of GPCR function [ 4 - 6 ] . Ste2p can be replaced in yeast cells with mammalian receptors with functionality conserved [ 7 ] , and Ste2p can be expressed and trigger signal transduction upon ligand binding in HEK293 cells [ 8 ] . Also , Ste2p can serve as an established model for fungal GPCRs . Recently , many more GPCRs in fungi have been identified and classified into six different categories based on sequence homology and ligand sensing [ 9 ] . Ste2p is the 96 most well studied receptor among fungal GPCRs , some of which are suggested to be related to fungal pathogenesis [ 9 ] . Recently , evidence has been growing that many GPCRs form homo - and / or hetero - dimeric or oligomeric complexes [ 9 - 11 ] . Oligomerization has been discovered by techniques such as crosslinking , bioluminescence resonance energy transfer , fluorescence resonance energy transfer , and immunoprecipitation [ 10 ] . Dimerization is thought to be important for various aspects of GPCR function such as receptor biogenesis , formation of ligand - binding sites , signal transduction , and down - regulation [ 11 , 12 ] . However , the view that dimers are involved in the rhodopsin - like ( Class 1A ) receptor - activated signaling has been challenged [ 13 - 16 ] . It has been demonstrated that Ste2p is internalized as a dimer / oligomer complex [ 17 , 18 ] , and oligomerization - defective mutants can bind α - factor but signaling is impaired [ 19 ] . It has also been shown that the dominant / negative effect on wild - type signaling of a signaling - defective mutation in Ste2p ( Ste2p - Y266C ) can be partially reversed by mutations in the G 56 XXXG 60 dimerization motif , indicating that signal transduction by oligomeric receptors requires an interaction between functional monomers [ 20 ] . Recently , dimer interfaces were identified in Ste2p near the extracellular end of TM1 and TM4 [ 21 ] . In that study it was found that dimerization was symmetric , occurring between receptors at the TM1 - TM1 interface or the TM4 - TM4 interface . In our current study , using the disulfide cross - linking methodology , we studied the participation of specific residues at the intracellular boundary between TM1 and intracellular loop one and the entire TM7 in Ste2p dimerization . 97 CHAPTER 3 Experimental procedures Strains , Media , and Plasmids Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain LM102 described by Sen and Marsh [ 22 ] was used in the growth arrest and LacZ assays . The genotype for the LM102 strain is : MAT a , bar1 , his4 , leu2 , trp1 , met1 , ura3 , FUS1 - lacZ : : URA3 , ste2 - dl ( deleted for the α - factor receptor ) . The protease - deficient strain BJS21 ( MAT a , prc1 - 407 prb1 - 1122 pep4 - 3 leu2 trp1 ura3 - 52 ste2 : : Kan R ) was used in disulfide cross - linking and western blot assays to decrease receptor degradation during analyses [ 23 ] . The parental plasmid , pHY4 expressing the template construct used for mutagenesis , FT - HT - Xa ( cys - less Ste2p with the FLAG and His epitope tags with Factor Xa cleavage cite , see Table 7 for description of the various receptor constructs used in this study ) was generated by introducing a tandem Factor Xa cleavage site between Val192 and Thr193 into pBec2 expressing FT - HT ( FLAG and His tagged Cys - less Ste2p ) under a consititutive GPD promoter [ 24 ] . Twenty - five single Cys mutations ranging from Leu 64 through Met 69 on TM1 and Thr 278 through Ala 296 on TM7 were generated in the pHY4 background by PCR based site - directed mutagenesis [ 25 ] . For co - expression experiments , plasmid pHY6 was constructed from p426GPD , a 2 - µ m based shuttle vector with a GPD promoter , CYC1 terminator , and URA marker for selection in yeast [ 26 ] . STE2 containing C - terminal FLAG and His epitope tags and a tandem Factor Xa digestion site in EL2 was PCR - amplified from plasmid pHY4 using primers that introduced BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites . The resulting PCR product was subcloned into the complementary sites of 98 p426GPD . Also , to create pHY6 an epitope tag comprising codons encoding a 9 - amino acid sequence of rhodopsin ( rho - tag ) was substituted for the FLAG and His epitope tags by ligation of a C - terminus part of STE2 product amplified from pBKY1 [ 27 ] . Cys mutants in this template were generated as described above . The sequences of constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis completed by the Molecular Biology Resource Facility located on the campus of the University of Tennessee . Primers were purchased from Sigma Genosys or IDT ( Coralville , IA ) . After sequence confirmation , constructs were transformed into the ste2 - deletion strains LM102 and BJS21 by the method of Gietz et al [ 28 ] . Transformants bearing the pHY4 or pHY6 constructs were selected by their growth in the absence of tryptophan for pHY4 on MLT medium ( Medium lacking tryptophan ) or in the absence of uracil for pHY6 on MLU medium ( Medium lacking uracil ) [ 29 ] . All media components were obtained from Difco . Growth Arrest ( Halo ) Assay Growth arrest was measured as described previously [ 30 ] . Briefly , filter disks were impregnated with 10 - µ l portions of peptide solutions at various concentrations and placed onto the overlay containing S . cerevisiae LM102 cells . The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 24 - 36 h and then observed for clear zones ( halos ) around the disks . The halo measured included the diameter of the disc . The normalized activity of each mutant was determined by comparing halo size for the FT - HT - Xa receptor at 2µg of α - factor . All 99 Table 7 Receptors used in this study Receptor name Description Wild - type Native Ste2p Ste2p - FT - HT Wild - type with FLAG / His epitope tags FT - HT Cys - less Ste2p - FT - HT FT - HT - Xa FT - HT with tandem Factor Xa cleavage sites Template for all Cys mutants generated in this study Rho - Xa Cys - less Ste2p with tandem Factor Xa cleavage sites and Rho tagged 100 assays were carried out at least three times with no more than a 2 - mm variation in halo size at a particular amount applied for each peptide . FUS1 - lacZ Gene Induction Assay S . cerevisiae LM102 contains a FUS1 - lacZ gene that is inducible by mating pheromone . Cells were grown overnight in SD ( synthetic defined ) medium ( Yeast nitrogen base medium ( Difco ) without aminoacid ) supplemented with the required amino acids at 30 °C to 5 x 10 6 cells / ml , washed by centrifugation , and grown for one doubling ( hemocytometer count ) at 30 °C . Induction was performed by adding 10 - 6 M of α - factor to 1 ml of concentrated cells ( 1 x 10 7 cells / ml ) . The mixtures were vortexed and , after incubation at 30 °C with shaking for 2 h , cells were harvested by centrifugation , and each pellet was resuspended and assayed for β - galactosidase activity ( expressed as Miller units ) in duplicate by using a β - galactosidase assay kit ( Pierce ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . The activity of each mutant was normalized by comparing β - galactosidase activity for the wild - type strain . The standard deviation was determined from three independent experiments . Preparation of membranes Membrane preparation of Ste2p was carried out essentially as described previously [ 30 ] . Cells were grown to log phase , and then 1 x 10 8 cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by agitation with glass beads in a lysis buffer containing 50 mM 101 Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 10 µ g / ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 2 µ g / ml leupeptin , and 2 µ g / ml pepstatin . The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 2 , 000 x g for 5 min , and then membranes were harvested by centrifugation at 15 , 000 x g for 45 min . The membrane pellet was washed and then resuspended in 100 µ l of a buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) containing 10 % glycerol , 50mM Hepes , 0 . 15mM NaCl , 2mM CaCl 2 , 5mM KCl , 5mM MgCl 2 , 4mM EDTA [ 30 ] . The protein concentration was determined by the Lowry assay ( Pierce ) , and the membrane preparation was stored at - 20 ºC overnight and used for further assay the next day . Disulfide Cross - linking with Cu - Phenanthroline The 100 µ g of membrane protein preparation were treated with a fresh preparation ( pH 7 . 4 ) of Cu ( II ) - 1 , 10 - phenanthroline ( Cu - P ; final concentration , 2 . 5 µM CuSO4 and 7 . 5µM phenanthroline ) . The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 30 min , terminated with 50 mM EDTA and kept on ice for 20 min followed by adding Laemmli sample buffer . For study of the time course of cross - linking , Cu - P treated samples were aliquoted at 45 sec , 2 min , 5 min , 10 min , 20 min , and 30 min before termination . In experiments designed to prevent disulfide bond formation , the membranes were treated with 5mM of NEM for 20min prior to incubation with Cu - P reagent . Alpha - factor or antagonist [ desW1 , desH2 ] α - factor ( 10 µ M final concentration ) were added to the membrane preparation and incubation allowed to proceed for 30 min prior to Cu - P treatment in experiments performed to examine the influence of ligand on dimerization . 102 Factor Xa digestion The membrane protein preparation ( 40 µg ) was incubated with 0 . 4 unit of Factor Xa ( Novagen ) in Factor Xa cleavage buffer ( 0 . 1M NaCl , 50 mM Tris - HCl , 5 mM CaCl 2 , pH 8 . 0 ) containing 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 30min . Each sample was divided into two aliquots . The reactions were terminated by adding one - third the volume of Laemmli sample buffer ( 30 % glycerol , 3 % SDS , 0 . 01 % bromphenol blue , 0 . 1875 M Tris , pH 6 . 8 ) . To one aliquot β - mercaptoethanol ( final 1 % , v / v ) was added for reducing conditions . Samples were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting . Saturation Binding assay with [ 3 H ] α - Factor Tritiated α - factor ( 10 . 2 Ci / mmol ) [ 31 ] was used in saturation binding assays on total membrane preparations as described previously [ 29 ] Specific binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis for single - site binding using Prism software ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , CA ) to determine the B max value ( receptors / cell ) for each mutant receptor . Each experiment was carried out at least 3 times . The close similarity among three replicates is indicated by the standard deviations shown in Table 8 . Western blot Immunoblot analysis of Ste2p was carried out as described previously [ 30 ] . Each sample was incubated at room temperature and then separated on NuPAGE 10 % Bis - Tris SDS - polyacrylamide gel ( Invitrogen ) using either non - reducing or reducing conditions 103 and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon TM - P membrane ( Millipore Corp . , Bedford , MA ) . The blot was probed with anti - FLAG M2 antibody ( Eastman Kodak Co . ) or 1D4 antibody ( a monoclonal antibody for rho - tag , purchased from Flintbox , BC , Canada ) , and the bands were visualized with the West Pico chemiluminescent detection system ( Pierce ) . Blots were imaged , and the total density of all Ste2p bands in each lane was determined using a ChemiDoc XRS photodocumentation system with Quantity One one - dimensional analysis software ( Bio - Rad ) . The intensity of the monomer and dimer signal was measured by densitometry and the ratio of the signals was determined . The percentage of dimer was calculated as [ Dimer / ( Dimer + Monomer ) x100 ] . The averages of the ratio were measured from at least three independent experiments and standard deviations are presented in Table 9 . HIS - select HC Nickel affinity Membrane preparations ( 500 µg protein ) from each sample were resuspended in a solubilization buffer ( 50 mM Tris HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 5 mM imidazole , pH 8 . 0 ) overnight . The solubilized proteins were then mixed with HIS - select HC Nickel affinity gel ( Sigma ) and incubated at 4 O C for 30 minutes with end - over - end mixing . The Nickel gel was separated from the mixture by centrifugation and then washed five times with buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 3 M NaCl , 5 mM imidazole ) . Ste2p was eluted from the Nickel gel two times using elution buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 3 M NaCl , 250 mM imidazole ) . The eluted samples were analyzed by SDS - PAGE silver staining and western blotting using antibodies against 104 FLAG , a 9 - amino acid sequence of rhodopsin ( rho - tag ) , or an antibody to the N - terminus of Ste2p [ 32 ] . MTSEA Labeling Membrane preparation was performed as decribed above . The 600 µg of the total proteins in PBS buffer ( 1ml ) were treated with MTSEA ( 2 - [ ( biotinoyl ) amino ] ethyl methanethiosulfonate ) biotin in DMSO ( 0 . 1mM ) for 2 minutes . Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 15000 RPM for 5 minutes in cold room and resuspended in 600 µl of RIPA buffer ( 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 5 % deoxycholic acid , 1 mm EDTA in 1× PBS , pH 7 . 4 ) , solubilized for 1 hour at 4 ° C . After addition of 150 µl of streptavidin slurry to the sample , it was incubated overnight at 4 ° C . The beads were then allowed to settle by gravity and supernatant was removed . The pellet was washed with RIPA buffer four times followed by washing with 2 % SDS in PBS . The proteins were extracted from the beads by incubating with 40 µl of Laemmli sample buffer at 55 ° C for 5 minutes . The samples were separated on 10 % SDS PAGE . Westen blotting was performed and the membrane blot was probed by using anti - FLAG as decribed . Labeling was expressed as a percentage of accessibility for each individual mutant . Percent labeling was calculated by quantitating total immunoreactivity of all bands on the FLAG immunoblot , then normalized with T199C accessibility ( = 100 % ) . 105 CHAPTER 4 Results Expression and Biological Activities of Cys Mutant Receptors To begin the analysis of Ste2p dimerization we chose twelve residues , six in TM1 and six in TM7 ( L289 – M294 ) proximal to the cytoplasmic face of Ste2p ( Fig . 14A ) for mutation to Cys . To extend the initial cross - linking results , thirteen additional residues in TM7 were mutated ( T278C – S288C , W295C , and A296C ) ( Fig . 14A ) . These targeted residues were chosen for several reasons : ( i ) The TM1 region chosen was one helix turn away from the sequence G 56 XXXG 60 previously established as being involved in Ste2p dimerization [ 19 ] , ( ii ) TM7 contains the AXXXA motif also suggested to play a role in dimerization of other proteins [ 33 ] and 20 known growth factor receptors with tyrosine kinase activity [ 34 ] , ( iii ) eight of the TM7 residues mutated ( S288 - S293 , W295 and A296 ) are conserved among fungal pheromone receptors [ 35 ] , and ( iv ) TM1 and TM7 are in close proximity to one another in crystal structures of GPCRs [ 36 , 37 ] and a model of Ste2p [ 35 ] . To eliminate non - specific cross - linking the template for these mutations was a Cys - less receptor . This template ( FT - HT - Xa ) also contained two C - terminal epitope tags ( FLAG and 6XHis ) and tandem Factor Xa cleavage sites ( IEGRIEGR ) in the second extracellular domain in order to facilitate detection of inter - domain cross - linking ( Fig . 14A ) . Wild - type , FT - HT ( Cys - less Ste2p with the FLAG and His epitope tags ) and FT - HT - Xa ( the template construct ) receptors used in this study demonstrated almost identical biological activities in a growth arrest assay indicating that incorporating the protease site 106 and the epitope tags did not alter receptor function ( Fig . 8B in Part II ) . In addition , FT - HT - Xa and Ste2p - FT - HT showed identical expression ( Fig . 14B ) . The expression level of each single - Cys mutant receptor was determined by western blot analysis . All mutants except P290C showed several bands between 44kDa and 55kDa and expression levels similar to that of FT - HT - Xa ( Fig . 15A and Fig . 18A ) . The multiple bands are typical of Ste2p expression and are due to differences in its glycosylation state , which does not influence receptor function [ 38 ] . Although two intrinsic Cys residues have been substituted , a weak band at 110 kDa , corresponding to a dimerized form of Ste2p , was observed for the FT - HT receptor ( Fig . 15B ) . This band is likely a native , non - covalent dimer which was not disrupted by membrane protein preparation or SDS - PAGE . Such dimers have been observed on SDS - PAGE gels by other investigators working with Ste2p [ 20 , 39 , 40 ] and are also seen with the FT - HT - Xa receptor ( Fig . 20A ; Lane 1 ) . This weak dimer observed in the Cys - less receptor is consistent with immunoprecipition results showing that the two intrinsic Cys are not involved in dimerization [ 18 ] . Membrane expression of P290C receptor was very low when judged by western blot ( Fig . 15A ) . It is known that one of the roles of the conserved proline in TM7 in GPCRs is correct folding [ 41 ] . The reduced expression of P290C was observed previously when it was shown that this receptor was primarily defective in plasma membrane localization using a P290C - GFP receptor , but the P290C - GFP construct did not demonstrate a defect in signaling [ 42 ] . 107 Figure 14 The two - dimensional topology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ste2p A . The cartoon indicates the location of the genetically engineered Factor Xa digestion site in EL2 and the epitope tags in the C - terminus . The two endogenous Cys residues ( C59 and C252 ) were mutated to Ser to generate FT - HT - Xa which was the parental GPCR used to generate the TM1 and TM7 cysteine mutations in positions 64 to 69 in TM1 and 278 to 296 in TM7 as indicated in the boxes .

Most mutant receptors showed similar β - galactosidase activity and growth arrest activity as compared to FT - HT - Xa . Two mutants ( M69C and L283C ) showed slightly lower induced β - galactosidase activities and A281C did not show growth arrest activity which is consistent with a previous study [ 43 ] . The difference between β - galactosidase activity and cell division arrest has been observed in many mutagenic studies of Ste2p [ 44 - 46 ] . It has been proposed that a short term signaling effect is measured by the β - galactosidase assay , whereas the long term effect is measured by the halo assay . The α - factor binding affinities of most Cys mutants were the same and within the experimental error range ( ± 2 . 5 fold ) , with the exceptions of the S292C , receptor which showed an increase in binding affinity ( 5 fold lower Kd value ) , and the L283C and S288C which showed a decrease in binding affinity ( up to 4 . 7 fold higher Kd values ) as compared to that of FT - HT - Xa . B - Max values determined by a saturation binding assay indicated that the numbers of binding sites were similar to FT - HT - Xa for most mutant receptors , with the exceptions of T279C V280C , A281C and T282C , which showed expression about 50 % lower than that of FT - HT - Xa . The P290C receptor showed no detectable α - factor binding , consistent with lack of measureable expression in the western blot analysis . Nonetheless , this receptor exhibited comparable growth arrest and β - galactosidase activities , suggesting that there were sufficient receptors expressed on the cell surface to elicit these biological responses upon ligand treatment ( Table 8 ) , albeit below detectable levels as measured by binding or western blots .

Taken together , we conclude that Cys mutation of the targeted residues did not severely interfere with receptor expression and function . We did not use the P290C receptor further in this study as it was expressed at a very low level . Dimerization of Some Cys Mutants in TM1 and TM7 Is Markedly Enhanced by the Oxidizing Reagent Cu ( II ) - 1 , 10 - Phenanthroline Initially we tested the involvement of twelve TM residues , six on TM1 and six on TM7 ( L289 – M294 ) proximal to the cytoplasmic face of Ste2p ( Fig . 14 ) , in dimerization . As stated above , FT - HT - Xa and virtually all of the single Cys containing Ste2p mutants exhibited weak bands at about 110 kDa consistent with a small amount of dimerized Ste2p . However , in all cases the predominant band was near 55 kDa , the molecular mass of monomeric Ste2p . When these same receptors were treated with Cu ( II ) - 1 , 10 - phenanthroline ( Cu - P ) , a reagent that has been used as an oxidizing reagent to drive disulfide bond formation in membrane proteins [ 48 - 51 ] , many of the Cys mutated receptors showed marked increases in the 110 kDa band and a concomitant decrease in the monomer band ( Fig 15A , Table 9 ) . Notably , V68C , a TM1 mutant and five mutants on TM7 ( L289C , L291C , S292C , S293C and M294C ) showed strong ( > 60 % ) dimerization upon Cu - P treatment ( Fig . 15A , Table 9 ) . When FT - HT ( epitope tagged Cys - less receptor ) and Ste2p - FT - HT ( epitope tagged receptor with intrinsic cysteine residues at C59 in TM1 and C252 in TM5 ) receptors were tested , there was no difference in dimerization in the presence and absence of Cu - P treatment ( Fig . 15B ) indicating that increased dimerization of mutant receptors was due to the specific cysteine residues 115 Table 9 Effect of ligand binding on Cu - P ( Cu ( II ) - 1 , 10 - phenanthroline ) stimulated disulfide bond formation 1 Receptor No treatment Cu – P 2 α , Cu - P 3 A , Cu - P 4 FT - HT - Xa 15 . 0 ± 4 . 4 12 . 0 ± 0 . 1 13 . 1 ± 0 . 2 12 . 2 ± 0 . 1 TM1 L64C 15 . 8 ± 0 . 1 11 . 3 ± 0 . 4 14 . 6 ± 1 . 0 13 . 6 ± 0 . 8 T65C 16 . 2 ± 0 . 1 14 . 4 ± 0 . 1 15 . 9 ± 0 . 3 12 . 8 ± 0 . 3 L66C 12 . 3 ± 0 . 4 11 . 9 ± 1 . 0 13 . 2 ± 0 . 4 11 . 9 ± 0 . 8 I67C 19 . 3 ± 4 . 5 17 . 0 ± 0 . 1 17 . 4 ± 4 . 1 18 . 0 ± 2 . 0 V68C 28 . 5 ± 3 . 2 99 . 2 ± 0 . 1 98 . 3 ± 0 . 8 98 . 8 ± 0 . 1 M69C 17 . 7 ± 6 . 9 14 . 2 ± 5 . 0 17 . 0 ± 6 . 4 28 . 9 ± 10 . 2 TM7 T278C 15 . 1 ± 0 . 8 65 . 8 ± 8 . 8 12 . 5 ± 0 . 1 12 . 4 ±0 . 1 T279C 17 . 3 ± 0 . 3 10 . 1 ± 2 . 3 15 . 8 ± 0 . 2 10 . 9 ± 2 . 7 V280C 15 . 3± 2 . 1 14 . 7± 1 . 5 16 . 3 ± 0 . 6 12 . 4 ± 0 . 1 A281C 16 . 8± 0 . 5 11 . 9± 0 . 6 14 . 3 ± 1 . 5 11 . 3 ± 0 . 1 T282C 11 . 7± 0 . 3 15 . 4± 0 . 1 12 . 0 ± 0 . 8 11 . 7 ± 0 . 1 L283C 16 . 6± 0 . 4 15 . 7± 0 . 2 13 . 3 ± 0 . 1 10 . 7± 3 . 5 L284C 15 . 2± 0 . 1 12 . 0 ± 0 . 2 17 . 7 ± 3 . 0 15 . 3 ± 0 . 1 A285C 16 . 5 ± 0 . 8 53 . 5 ± 8 . 3 16 . 5 ± 2 . 1 17 . 7 ±0 . 5 V286C 15 . 6 ± 0 . 4 17 . 0 ± 0 . 3 13 . 2 ± 2 . 0 15 . 9 ±0 . 4 L287C 16 . 0 ± 0 . 1 14 . 3 ± 1 . 3 11 . 3 ± 1 . 7 16 . 0 ±1 . 8 S288C 14 . 7 ± 1 . 0 14 . 7 ± 1 . 5 11 . 5 ± 0 . 6 12 . 6 ±0 . 2 L289C 26 . 8 ± 2 . 0 61 . 0 ± 9 . 8 50 . 2 ± 12 . 9 40 . 9 ±8 . 2 L291C 31 . 8 ± 0 . 4 66 . 4 ± 0 . 1 52 . 0 ± 8 . 8 44 . 5 ± 5 . 6 S292C 30 . 2 ± 8 . 3 82 . 3 ± 0 . 4 75 . 5 ± 11 . 4 65 . 9 ±0 . 2 S293C 21 . 1 ± 0 . 7 70 . 2 ± 5 . 3 38 . 5 ± 8 . 3 44 . 0 ±0 . 1 116 ( Table 9 continued ) M294C 27 . 0 ± 7 . 6 75 . 6 ± 1 . 0 57 . 8 ± 0 . 7 50 . 8 ± 1 . 0 W295C 15 . 7 ± 0 . 2 95 . 2 ± 0 . 7 76 . 2 ± 0 . 6 86 . 3 ±0 . 1 A296C 14 . 8 ± 2 . 1 91 . 1 ± 1 . 0 73 . 6 ± 1 . 5 82 . 1 ±0 . 8 1 The intensity of the monomer and dimer signal was measured by densitometry and the ratio of the signals was determined .

To further test whether dimerization was mediated by disulfide bond formation involving cysteine residues , NEM ( N - ethylmaleimide ) pre - treatment was used . NEM alkylates the free – SH group of cysteine irreversibly , so that disulfide bond formation cannot occur after NEM treatment . As shown in Figure 15C and D , pretreatment of receptors , which increased dimer upon Cu - P , with NEM completely , eliminated the Cu - P mediated dimerization ( Fig . 15C , and D ) . In addition , in all cases where a high level of crosslinking was observed the membranes were treated with Cu - P and the reaction terminated by EDTA only and by EDTA and NEM to prevent crosslinking that might occur upon subsequent manipulation of the sample . No differences were found in the extent of crosslinking with the additional NEM treatment ( Table 10 ) . In contrast to these six residues , placement of cysteine at positions 64 , 65 , 66 , 67 and 69 followed by Cu - P treatment did not result in a dimer population that exceeded 20 % ( Fig . 15A , right panel ) . Taken together , the results indicate that insertion of cysteine residues at position 68 on TM1 and positions 289 , 291 , 292 , 293 or 294 on TM7 led to high levels of Ste2p dimerization through disulfide formation . Although the studies described above provided evidence for Cu - P catalyzed Ste2p dimerization , it was possible that the single Cys mutant Ste2p is cross - linking with other proteins with similar molecular weight to yield the observed high molecular weight bands . To confirm that the observed dimer band in the western blot was a Ste2p - Ste2p homo - dimer , we took advantage of the protease ( Factor Xa ) digestion site engineered into EL2 of Ste2p . Cross - linking between two Cys residues in TM7 followed by Factor Xa digestion would yield a homodimeric complex of 66 kDa ( Fig . 16A ) . Indeed TM7 mutants ( L289C , L291C , S292C , S293C and M294C ) digested with Factor Xa led to 118 Table 10 Effect of NEM on Cu - P ( Cu ( II ) - 1 , 10 - phenanthroline ) stimulated disulfide bond formation 1 Receptor No treatment EDTA 2 EDTA and NEM 3 FT - HT - Xa 16 ± 2 . 3 17 ± 2 . 3 16 ± 0 . 1 TM1 V68C 22 ± 10 . 3 99 ± 0 . 3 99± 0 . 1 TM7 T278C 22 ± 13 . 5 61 ± 1 . 7 54 ± 0 . 3 A285C 15 ± 4 . 5 58 ± 0 . 6 54 ± 0 . 2 L289C 11 ± 5 . 0 59± 2 . 5 53 ± 0 . 9 L291C 26 ± 8 . 8 64 ± 3 . 5 57 ± 0 . 1 S292C 17 ± 3 . 2 76 ± 0 . 8 70 ± 6 . 5 S293C 19 ± 5 . 5 75 ± 4 . 8 69 ± 4 . 8 M294C 26 ± 1 . 1 72 ± 6 . 3 76 ± 3 . 7 W295C 32 ± 8 . 3 80 ± 4 . 2 81 ± 3 . 5 A296C 39 ± 0 . 9 66 ± 8 . 3 79 ± 5 . 2 1 The intensity of the monomer and dimer signal was measured by densitometry and the ratio of the signals was determined .

This band was markedly reduced when the gel was run in the presence of β - mercaptoethanol , a potent disulfide reducing agent . The 66 kDa band was specific for dimerized receptors with a disulfide connection between monomers as the band was not observed for FT - HT - Xa ( Cys - less ) and a TM1 mutant ( M69C ) in which there was no disulfide - mediated dimer formation ( Fig . 16B ) . The monomer bands ( ~ 55 kDa ) are due to an incomplete Factor Xa digestion . We performed partial digestion because a longer incubation led to the degradation of all bands . Bands at ~ 33 kD are Factor Xa digestion products of the monomeric receptor species ( remaining in the samples ) . The generation of this band from the S292C and S293C mutant receptors , in which the majority of receptors formed dimers ( Fig . 15A , right panel ) , is likely the result of detergent induced ( Triton X - 100 in Factor Xa digestion buffer ) dissociation of background dimers . Indeed , the presence of background dimers from all the receptors tested including FT - HT - Xa ( Cys - less ) and M69C were reduced in the presence of Triton X - 100 . Further support for the disulfide bond induced dimer formation was provided when differentially tagged receptors were co - expressed . M294C mutants and FT - XT - Xa were chosen for this experiment . Membranes from cells co - expressing receptors tagged with the FLAG / His epitopes and receptors tagged with the Rho epitope were precipitated using the HIS - select HC Nickel affinity column and immunoblotted with anti - Ste2p antibody and anti - Rho antibody . The total amount of receptors present following immune precipitation was determined using an antibody directed against the N - terminus of the receptor ( left panel , Fig . 17 ) . For both the FT - HT - Xa / Rho - Xa and M294C / M294C - Rho 120 receptors , bands corresponding to monomeric and dimeric forms were detected in both the presence and absence of Cu - P treatment . The dimerized form was more abundant than the monomer for the M294C / M294C - Rho receptor due to the presence of the engineered cysteines which form disulfide bond thus increasing the dimer population . In contrast , the FT - HT - Xa / Rho - Xa receptor showed a prominent monomer band and weak dimer signal , as observed for FT - HT - Xa expressed alone . As seen in right panel of figure 17 , using the anti - Rho antibody , only dimerized receptors were observed for the M294C - Rho receptor , which indicates that Ste2p did indeed homo - dimerize . These results and the cross - linking results demonstrate the proximal location of the residues ( L289 - M294 ) on the intracellular parts of the TM7 domains of two Ste2p molecules , and provide evidence for homo - dimerization of Ste2p involving TM7 as well as TM1 . The finding that six consecutive residues in TM7 , with the exception of P290C , showed an increase in dimerization was unexpected since this region is believed to be α - helical . To see whether dimerization would occur throughout TM7 , we expanded Cys replacement to include the full TM7 by generating eleven additional cysteine mutants N - terminal to the L289 residue ( T278C , T279C , V280C , A281C , T282C , L283C , L284C , A285C , V286C , L287C , and S288C ) and two cysteine mutants C - terminal to the M294 residue ( W295C and A296C ) . Membranes from each mutant were prepared and processed with or without Cu - P treatment . Compared to the Cys - less FT - HT - Xa receptor , the T278C and A285C receptors exhibited at least a 3 - fold increase in dimerization ( Fig . 18 ) . Though dimer formation on T278C mutant was not observed in a recent study [ 21 ] , this mutant showed strong dimer formation with Cu - P treatment in our study . The difference observed for this 121 Figure 16 Protease Factor Xa digestions of single cysteine containing Ste2p receptors A .

In our current study Cu - P was used at a final concentration of 2 . 5 µ M , while in the previous study the concentration was 500 µ M . In addition , in our study we used membrane preparations whereas whole cells were used by Wang et al [ 21 ] . Receptors W295C and A296C showed a large increase in dimerization upon treatment with Cu - P compared to FT - HT - Xa , ( Fig 18 ; Table 9 ) . In contrast , nine mutants ( T279C - L284C , V286C , L287C and S288C ) gave virtually identical dimerization results in the presence and absence of the oxidizing agent ( Fig . 18 ; Table 9 ) . Again NEM ( N - ethylmaleimide ) pre - treatment completely eliminated the Cu - P mediated dimerization ( Fig . 18C ) . These results indicate that unlike the residues C - terminal to Pro290 , residues located N - terminal to Pro290 exhibit a periodicity with respect to dimer formation of Cys mutants which is consistent with the α - helical structure predicted for typical transmembrane domains of GPCRs . Because of a concern that disulfide crosslinking might trap and thereby favor the accumulation of dimer during the 30 min oxidization reaction , we analyzed the efficiency of the dimer formation at different times ( Fig . 19 ) . The results indicated that L291C , S292C , S293C , M294C , and W295C started to form dimers after 45 seconds of Cu - P incubation and reached half maximum levels within 5 minutes . Previously , the relative distance between TM residues in rhodopsin was estimated by the reaction time for disulfide formation between to Cys residues on different TMs [ 52 ] . Thus , our data indicate that TM7 C - terminal to P290 is highly flexible allowing all of the residues in this part of TM7 to form disulfide bonds with more or less the same rapidity . 125 Effect of Ligand Addition on Dimerization It is generally believed that activation of GPCRs upon ligand binding results in a conformational change involving rearrangement of transmembrane domains [ 53 - 56 ] . To ascertain whether this conformational change would affect Ste2p dimerization , we investigated the changes in the dimerization pattern of Ste2p receptors in the presence and absence of ligand . The membranes expressing each mutant receptor were incubated with agonist ( α - factor ) or an antagonist ( [ desW1 , desH2 ] α - factor ) and then treated with Cu - P . Dimer and monomer formation were monitored by western blots ( Fig . 20A and 20B ) and the ratio of dimer to monomer was determined ( see Methods , Table 9 ) . Dimer formation of the Cys - less FT - HT - Xa receptor in the presence or absence of Cu - P was not affected by agonist or antagonist ( Fig . 20A and Table 9 ) . Also , the ratio of dimer to monomer formed by Cu - P mediated cross - linking of the TM1 cysteine mutants did not change significantly after incubation with α - factor or α - factor antagonist ( representative results for V68C is shown in Fig . 20B and Table 9 ) . A time course of crosslinking at 0 . 75 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 , and 30 min was also performed with the V68C receptor incubated with either α - factor or antagonist . The reaction was complete at 45 seconds ( 0 . 75 min ) and no change in crosslinking relative to that observed in the absence of ligand was observed ( Fig . 21 ) . TM7 mutants which did not exhibit increased levels of dimerization upon Cu - P treatment ( T279C - L284C , V286C , L287C and S288C ) , also showed no difference in dimer formation in the presence of α - factor or antagonist ( representative results for S288C is shown in Fig . 20B Table 9 ) . However , for those TM7 receptors which exhibited significant increase in dimer formation upon Cu - P treatment ( A285C , L289C , L291C , S292C , S293C , M294C , W295C , and A296C ) , α - factor treatment decreased the relative 126 amount of dimer formation ( representative results for T278C and W295C are shown in Fig . 20B and Table 9 ) . Taken together , the dimer interface of TM7 of Ste2p changed in response to either agonist or antagonist binding . 127 Figure 18 Effect of Cu - P ( Cu ( II ) - 1 , 10 - phenanthroline ) treatment on FT - HT - Xa containing cysteine replacements in TM7 Membranes were prepared , treated without ( A ) or with ( B ) Cu - P reagent , solubilized and separated on SDS - PAGE .

All of our studies were conducted with Ste2p in its membrane - bound state . Previously , it was shown that the maximum distance between α - carbons linked by disulfide bonds is about 7Å [ 57 ] . Thus , cross - linking experiments should identify amino acid side chains that are in close proximity when using the Cu - P oxidation reagent , which facilitates oxidation of sulfhydryl groups in cysteine residues . In analyzing our data , it is important to note that disulfide crosslinking might trap transient intermediates . Depending on the time of cross - linking relative to the rates of interconversion of the monomeric and dimeric states of the receptor , covalent cross - linking might affect the equilibrium and bias the sample to yield more dimeric species than are present in the native population of the receptor . However , by comparing the cross - linked population of a receptor mutated in a specific region we believe we can learn about the relative tendencies of individual residues to participate in receptor - receptor contacts . Cross - linking between cysteine residues engineered into GPCRs and the use of Cu - P as an oxidizing reagent to facilitate disulfide bond formation between TMs in GPCRs has been used extensively by the Wess and Oprian laboratories [ 48 , 51 , 55 , 58 , 59 ] and was recently applied to Ste2p dimerization [ 21 ] . It had been suggested that TM1 formed a component of the interface between the two receptors in the Ste2p dimer [ 19 , 21 , 60 ] . Our results support these findings and furthermore provide direct evidence for the involvement of V68 in TM1 in Ste2p 134 dimerization . The mutant receptor V68C showed markedly increased dimerization over that of the FT - HT - Xa after Cu - P treatment , while under identical conditions all of the remaining TM1 Cys receptors showed at most a minor increase in dimer formation ( Fig . 15A ; Table 9 ) . The ability of V68C to form dimers is in good agreement with the recently published finding of a V45C - V45C cross - linking [ 21 ] since V45 and V68 are both located on the same face of TM1 and on opposite ends of TM1 ( Fig . 22A ) . It was previously proposed that G 56 XXXG 60 residues in TM1 of one GPCR monomer interacted with a hydrophobic - rich surface of TM1 ( perhaps involving residues I53 , V57 , A61 , and L64 ) , on the second monomer by a kind of “groove - in - ridge” association with Gly being the “groove” residues and the hydrophobic residues acting as the “ridges” [ 19 ] . In this study , we found that V68C formed a disulfide bond . The fact that only one residue in the sequence ( L 64 T 66 L 67 I 67 V 68 M 69 ) formed this linkage suggests that the Ste2p - Ste2p interactions involving this region of the TM1 helix have significant spatial restrictions and that the TM1 helix at the carboxyl side of the G 56 XXXG 60 sequence may be relatively rigid . We note that a biophysical analysis of TM1 in micelles indicates that the G 56 XXXG 60 motif itself is flexible [ [ 61 ] and unpublished results ] and may facilitate TM - TM interactions between proximal helical elements . In any event our mutational analysis of the TM1 domain defines a specific residue ( V68 ) that appears to be involved in Ste2p dimerization . In a previous FRET analysis , Overton and Blumer [ 60 ] analyzed the transmembrane domains of Ste2p that are involved in dimerization by expressing various combinations of Ste2p fragments . They concluded that TM1 is necessary and probably 135 Figure 22 Dimerization interfaces of Ste2p A . V68 ( red ) , a dimer contact found in the current study , is located on the same plane with V45 ( green ) a dimer contact at the extracelluar end of TM1 [ 21 ] . The backbones of two glycine residues ( blue ) known to play a role in Ste2p dimerization are shown . Two residues ( F55 , R58 ) involved in ligand binding are presented as a stick model located on the opposite side of the dimer interface . B . TM7 / TM7 dimer interface . The backbones of three dimer contacts identified from the current study ( T278 , A285 and L289 , from top to bottom ) are colored green . A281 ( light gray ) and T282 ( red ) would appear to be candidates for dimer contact based on a sideview of TM7 ( Fig . 23A ) , but the model here shows that alignments of these two residues are not favorable for disulfide bond formation . C . Proposed oligomerization interfaces of Ste2p . Dimerization of Ste2p involving TM1 / TM1 ( magenta ) and / or TM7 / TM7 ( yellow ) interface allows TM4 / TM4 interface ( dark grey ) to mediate a new dimerization contact enabling oligomerization . An extracellular view of a representative trimer is shown . 136 137 sufficient for dimerization , although they speculated that the N - terminus and TM2 may contribute to stabilize the dimers . However , our disulfide cross - linking data demonstrated that TM7 is also involved in the interface for dimerization of Ste2p . In the present study we have analyzed full - length receptors and it is possible that the fusion of fluorescent protein at the C - terminal of truncated receptors in the previous FRET studies hampered the interactions between TM7 domains . The involvement of TM7 in dimer formation is consistent with our previous observation that a TM6 - TM7 fragment of Ste2p runs as a dimer in SDS - PAGE gel [ 62 ] . The finding that TM7 residues are involved in Ste2p dimerization leads us to propose that at least three dimerization interfaces can exist in Ste2p . In addition to the TM1 and TM4 interfaces previously found [ 21 , 60 ] , our data suggests that TM7 - TM7 interactions are also involved in direct contacts in the Ste2p dimer . Since TM1 - TM1 and TM4 - TM4 contacts have been previously suggested to be involved in higher order oligomers [ 21 ] and a Ste2p trimer was demonstrated by crosslinking in a gel and by atomic force microscopy [ 40 ] it is possible that in a single receptor can interact simultaneously with two additional receptors with different interfaces between the monomers : TM7 and / or TM1 can interact with TM7 and / or TM1 of a second receptor , while TM4 can interact with TM4 of a third receptor to form oligomers . A representation of a trimer is shown in Fig . 22C . With higher oligomers envisaged to contain additional interactions . Based on the existing experimental data it is not possible to conclude whether TM1 - TM1 and TM7 - TM7 dimers can be formed simultaneously in the cell . The results described in this study show that cysteine residues introduced in positions T278 , A285 and L289 on the extracellular half of TM7 form a disulfide bond with their 138 counterpart in another Ste2p monomer ( Fig . 23A ) . This finding provides valuable information relating to the arrangement of the TM bundles of Ste2p and allow us to present a helical wheel projection of TM7 ( Fig . 23B ) in which these three residues are oriented outward instead of facing inside the TM bundles as proposed previously in the Ste2p model based on rhodopsin [ 35 ] . A281 and T282 , which in a two dimensional representation ( Fig . 23A , 23B ) appear to lie on the same helix face , do not form dimers . However , our 3D model suggests that A281 and T282 are not close enough to form disulfide bonds when replaced by Cys as illustrated in the modified model ( Fig . 22B ) . Therefore , the dimerization mediated by T278 , A285 , and L289 is consistent with the alpha - helical periodicity in TM7 that continues up to Pro 290 . In the absence of a crystal structure for Ste2p , the disulfide crosslinking results contributes to understanding structural features of the functional receptor such as inter - helical interactions that may be involved in oligomerization . In contrast to the specific pattern of residues which could participate in cross - linking in the portion of TM7 most adjacent to the extracellular surface , when the engineered cysteine residues were located at the intracellular end of the TM7 , C - terminal to Pro290 which creates a kink in TM7 , all residues were able to form disulfide bonds ( Fig . 23A ) implying an absence of an ordered structure . We do not believe that the experimental protocol , specifically the use of the oxidizing agent , leads to a global denaturation of Ste2p because native cysteine residues in TM1 ( C59 ) and TM5 ( C252 ) did not form an inter - GPCR disulfide linkage under the same experimental conditions 139 Figure 23 Representation of cross - linking results of TM7 and helical wheel presentation of TM1 and TM7 in Ste2p A .

Residues indicated by a circle filled in gray are involved in dimer formation as found in this study . Residues marked by an X are important for ligand binding . 140 141 ( Fig . 15B ) . Additionally , only one of the TM1 cysteine mutants formed Ste2p dimers and only three residues out of twelve in the extracellular part of the TM7 showed increased dimerization . Rather we propose that the L291 - W295 region of Ste2p may be flexible enough to allow these residues to be exposed for disulfide bond formation with their counterpart in a second Ste2p monomer . Proline residues disrupt hydrogen bonding and have been shown to twist the standard structure of helices by introducing a kink between the segments contiguous with each other and to form molecular hinges [ 41 , 63 ] . The dynamic nature of the residues at the carboxyl side of Pro290 is consistent with the results of a high resolution analysis of a 73 residue fragment of Ste2p in DPC micelles which indicated that the Pro290 resulted in a kinked helix in this membrane mimetic environment [ 64 ] . An irregular helical structure in part of a TM has been documented in the crystal structures of other GPCRs . In rhodopsin , TM7 contains a helical segment near the extracellular face of the receptor , followed by a non - helical segment in the vicinity of P303 [ 36 ] . The crystal structure of the beta - adrenergic receptor also indicates the presence of a short extended area in TM7 [ 65 ] . In addition , it has been proposed , using computational simulations of the NPXXY motif , that this region was not an ideal alpha helical structure [ 66 ] . Thus , there is precedent to propose that the part of TM7 in Ste2p that is near the cytoplasmic membrane interface is not helical in structure . Although there is a possibility that the residues C - terminal to Pro290 are not in the transmembrane domain , this is unlikely because a previous study [ 42 ] and our cysteine accessibility results for these residues , strongly suggested that W295 and A296 are the boundary between TM7 and the intracellular space ( Fig . 24 and Table 11 ) . Obviously , non - hydrogen bonded elements of a peptide in a membrane represent a high energy state 142 Figure 24 Cysteine labeling of selected mutants Membranes were prepared from cells expressing each receptors and treated with MTSEA - biotin or non - treated as indicated .

Water molecules that bridge various receptor regions have been implicated in the crystal structure of other GPCRs [ 36 , 65 ] . Their involvement in the structure of Ste2p must await a high resolution structure of this GPCR . It has been observed that the homo - dimer interface of the dopamine D2 receptor can be altered upon ligand binding [ 50 ] . To monitor possible ligand - induced conformational changes in Ste2p dimerization , membrane samples were incubated with either agonist or antagonist followed by Cu - P treatment . TM1 mutants showed similar degrees of dimer formation in the presence or absence of ligand , which is consistent with a recent study showing that dimer formation of V45C at TM1 was insensitive to α - factor treatment [ 21 ] . In contrast , both agonist and antagonist treatment led to a decrease in the level of dimer formed by TM7 - TM7 interaction indicating that ligand binding caused a conformational change in this region . In addition to a conformational change inTM7 induced by ligand binding , we can not rule out changes elsewhere in Ste2p upon ligand binding that affects dimer formation . The effect of ligand binding on TM7 - mediated dimer formation suggests that resting state dimers and activated state dimers involve different TM arrangements . Previously it was shown that the ratio of monomer to dimer did not change in the presence of ligand in Ste2p as tested by FRET [ 17 ] . Thus , it is possible that the equilibrium distribution between monomer - dimer is maintained during receptor activation , even while the dimer interface may differ . In addition , a recent study of the serotonin 5HT2c receptor demonstrated that ligand binding induces a differential effect 145 on the dimer interfaces . While the TM1 / TM1 interface was insensitive to ligand treatment , the TM4 / 5 interface changed during receptor activation [ 67 ] . Interestingly , a number mutations of residues ( V276 , V280 , A281 , T282 , and L284 ) which compensated for the activity of the signaling defective mutant receptor Y266C are clustered at the extracellular portion of the TM7 ( Fig . 23A , TM7 residues labeled as * ) [ 68 ] . The cluster of compensatory mutations at the extracellular part of TM7 indicates that this region is important for receptor activation . The decrease in dimer formation at TM7 after ligand binding that we showed for T278C and A285C , both located in the extracellular part of TM7 , also suggest a conformational change in this portion of Ste2p . In addition , two residues in TM1 ( M54 and F55 ) were also identified [ 68 ] as compensatory mutations for Y266C . Residues F55 and R58 are known to be ligand contact sites and M54 is adjacent to F55 [ 23 , 69 ] . Therefore , the extracellular ends of TM1 and TM7 may play a key role in initiating receptor activation after ligand binding to TM1 and the subsequent conformational change of TM7 may facilitate the receptor to adopt a fully activated state . Thus , the regions of the receptor that experience changes in the formation of dimers upon ligand binding might be important for the activation mechanism . Many GPCRs assume different conformations in their active and inactive states , and it is widely accepted that GPCRs sample many states even when occupied by ligand [ for review see [ 70 ] ] . Under our experimental conditions Cu - P mediated disulfide formation appears to distinguish these different conformations , possibly implicating a change of the dimer interface as part of the receptor activation mechanism . The similar effects of agonist and antagonist binding on disulfide formation involving residues in the TM7 dimer interface can be understood in terms of distinct 146 binding and signaling domains for α - factor [ 71 ] . Extensive structure - function analysis of α - factor and Ste2p has revealed that the N - terminus of α - factor has a role in activating the receptor while the C - terminus is critical for receptor binding . Since agonist ( WHWLQLKPGQPNleY ) and antagonist ( WLQLKPGQPNleY ) are very similar ( 10 identical residues out of 13 ) , and both ligands compete with each other with high affinity in binding to Ste2p , it is reasonable to suppose that the binding sites of both ligands in the receptor are highly overlapping especially at the C - terminal end of the ligands . Moreover , we believe that ligand binding is a multi - step process in which the carboxyl terminus of α - factor and α - factor antagonists bind first and then several conformational changes occur along the activation pathway [ 72 , 73 ] . Finally , the carboxyl terminus has been shown to interact with residues in TM1 [ 23 , 73 ] . Based on this understanding it is not unreasonable that both agonists and antagonists first bind to TM1 promoting changes in the conformation of both TM1 and of TM7 , which is next to TM1 in the tertiary structure of Ste2p . These conformational changes apparently restrict disulfide formation at the TM7 dimerization interface between Ste2p monomers except the region between the boundary of TM7 and cytoplasmic tail . Much remains to be understood concerning the significance of GPCR dimerization in the signaling process . The residues in TM7 examined in this study , S 288 LPLSSMWA 296 , are highly conserved in Class D receptors and are considered to have a similar function to the NPXXY residues in Class A receptors [ 35 ] . In Class A receptors , the NPXXY motif is regarded to be important for receptor activation . For example , mutations in this motif affected receptor expression , ligand affinity , receptor sequestration , and heterotrimeric G protein coupling [ 74 - 77 ] . It is possible that TM7 147 plays an important role in both receptor activation and dimerization in Ste2p and in other GPCRs as well , and that dimerization is linked to signaling by these ubiquitous proteins . The results presented herein provide residue level information concerning the proximity of different sites on two Ste2p monomers in their native membrane environment . The physiological relevance of this information and of dimerization in GPCRs continues to be an intriguing area of GPCR biology . 148 List of References for Part III 1 . Lefkowitz , R .

As discussed in the part I , GPCRs sense signals in the extracellular environment . Ligand binding to its cognate GPCR promotes a conformational change in the receptor and triggers signal transduction . As the receptor goes through the activation mechanism , it is well known that movement of the transmembrane domains are involved in the change of conformation [ 1 ] , [ 2 - 6 ] . It is expected that concurrent changes in conformation also occur in the N - terminus and extracellular loops of the receptor , though limited structural information is available for these regions . Using the substituted cysteine accessibility method ( SCAM ) [ 7 ] our lab found that the first extracellular loop ( EL1 ) of the α - factor receptor has a tertiary structure that limits solvent accessibility to some residues , and this accessibility changes in a ligand - dependent manner presumably through induced conformation changes . SCAM analysis is being used currently in our lab to study the accessibility of residues of the N - terminus of Ste2p . During these analyses it was noted that the N - terminal mutant Y26C promotes receptor dimerization under both reducing and non - reducing conditions . This observation stimulated the investigation into whether other N - terminal residues participate in the dimerization of Ste2p , as was observed for residues in TM1 and TM7 ( Part 3 , Dissertation ) . In the Class C group of GPCRs , it has been established that a motif known as the Venus fly trap ( VFT ) at the N - terminus , and cysteine - rich domains ( CRDs ) , 160 localized between VFT and transmembrane domains are important for dimerization of this receptor class [ 8 , 9 ] [ 10 - 13 ] . Thus there is a precedent for the involvement of N - terminal residues in GPCR dimerization . 161 CHAPTER 2 Experimental procedures Strains , Media , and Plasmids The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BJS21 was used in all assays [ 7 ] . The relevant genotype is MAT a , prc1 - 407 prb1 - 1122 pep4 - 3 leu2 trp1 ura3 - 52 ste2 : : Kan R . For disulfide cross - linking , yeast strain BJS21 ( ste2 - deletion strain ) bearing each fifteen different single cys mutants ranging from Gln 20 through Ser 34 of N - terminus of Ste2p were given from Seraj Uddin ( at UT knoxville ) . Cells were grown in the absence of tryptophan on MLT medium [ 7 ] . All media components were obtained from Difco and were of the highest quality available . Preparation of membranes Membrane preparation of Ste2p was carried out essentially as described previously [ 14 ] . Cells were grown to log phase , and then 1 x 10 8 cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by agitation with glass beads in a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 10 µ g / ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 2 µ g / ml leupeptin , and 2 µ g / ml pepstatin . The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 2 , 000 x g for 5 min , and then membranes were harvested by centrifugation at 15 , 000 x g for 45 min . The membrane pellet was washed and then resuspended in 100 µ l of a buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) containing 10 % glycerol , 50mM Hepes , 0 . 15mM NaCl , 2mM CaCl 2 , 5mM KCl , 5mM MgCl 2 , 4mM EDTA [ 14 ] . The protein concentration was determined by the Lowry assay ( Pierce ) , and the membrane preparation was stored at - 20 ºC overnight and used for further assay the next day . 162 Disulfide Cross - linking with Cu - Phenanthroline The 100 µ g of membrane protein preparation were treated with a fresh preparation ( pH 7 . 4 ) of Cu ( II ) - 1 , 10 - phenanthroline ( CuP ; final concentration , 2 . 5 µM CuSO4 and 7 . 5µM phenanthroline ) . The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 30 min , terminated with 50 mM EDTA and kept on ice for 20 min followed by adding Laemmli sample buffer . In experiments designed to prevent disulfide bond formation , the membranes were treated with 5mM of NEM for 20min prior to incubation with Cu - P reagent . α - factor or antagonist , [ desW1 , desH2 ] α - factor ( 10 µ M final concentration ) , were added to the membrane preparation and incubation allowed to proceed for 30 min prior to Cu - P treatment in experiments performed to examine the influence of ligand on dimerization Western blot Immunoblot analysis of Ste2p was carried out as described previously [ 14 ] . Each sample was incubated at room temperature and then separated on NuPAGE 10 % Bis - Tris SDS - polyacrylamide gel ( Invitrogen ) using either non - reducing or reducing conditions and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon TM - P membrane ( Millipore Corp . , Bedford , MA ) . The blot was probed with anti - FLAG M2 antibody ( Eastman Kodak Co . ) and the bands were visualized with the West Pico chemiluminescent detection system ( Pierce ) . 163 CHAPTER 3 Results Cells expressing each of the different Cys mutants were grown and membranes were prepared . The samples were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and probed with anti - FLAG antibody ( Fig . 25 ) . In general , all mutants showed higher dimer formation than WT under non - reducing conditions without Cu - P treatment ( Fig . 25A and Fig . 26 ) . About 20 % of the WT receptor was in the dimer form under conditions that we showed previously ( Part III , Dissertation ) was due to non - disulfide mediated , inter - molecular interactions , whereas from 30 to 90 % of the mutant receptors were in the dimer form ( Fig . 26 ) . Nine mutants ( G21C , T23C , N25C , T27C , I29C , G31C , N32C , G33C , and S34C ) showed a small increase in dimerization ( ranging from 1 . 3 ~ 1 . 8 fold ) in comparison to WT ( Fig . 25A and Fig . 26 ) . Six Cys mutants , Q20C , S22C , I24C , Y26C , S28C , and Y30C , showed a large increase in the dimer population relative to the monomer receptor ( Fig . 25A and Fig 26 ) . Under reducing conditions ( data not shown , results from Seraj Uddin , a student in the Becker Lab ) , the percentage of dimer for all Cys mutants , except Y26C , dropped to that of WT indicating that these dimers were formed via disulfide bonds between the mutated Cys residues . The fact that the Y26C dimer was not affected by reducing conditions indicated that this unique dimer was formed by a non - disulfide interaction . Mutation of the residue might lead to increased non - covalent interactions between residues on two Ste2p molecules resulting in dimerization of the receptor . N25C and T27C receptors showed different band patterns compared to WT ( Fig . 25A ) . When analyzed by SDS - PAGE , WT Ste2p migrates as a group of three bands , 164 consisting of the two major glycosylated forms of Ste2p along with the lower molecular weight unglycosylated form ( see WT lane , Fig . 25A ) . N25 and T27 are known to be within the motif of N - linked glycosylation ( Asn - X - Ser / Thr ) of the receptor [ 15 ] . Thus , substitution of these residues to Cys decreased heterogeneity of the glycosylated receptors leading to a more prominent lower molecular weight band which is the non - glycosylated form of Ste2p and a concomitant lesser amount of higher molecular weight band ( s ) . While N32C and S34C also are within an N - linked glycosylation motif , there were no readily observable differences with these two mutants with respect to WT ( Fig . 25A ) . It was possible that disulfide bonds were prevented from forming in some mutants due to the environment of the Cys residue . Addition of Cu - P to provide a more oxidative environment that facilitates Cys cross - linking has been used in many experiments to determine Cys - Cys disulfide formation in membrane proteins [ 16 - 20 ] . Treatment of Cu - P was performed with all fifteen N - terminal Cys mutants ( Fig 25B ) . Nine mutants ( Q20C , G21C , T23C , Y26C , and from Y30C through S34C ) were not affected by Cu - P treatment ( Fig . 25A , B , Fig . 27 ) . However , three mutants ( S22C , I24C , and S28C ) exhibited increased dimerization upon Cu - P treatment . In addition , three mutants ( N25C , T27C , and I29C ) which in the previous experiment did not form dimers without Cu - P addition , did dimerize in the presence of Cu - P . To verify that this increase was due to disulfide bond formation , NEM pretreatment was performed with the N25C , T27C and I29C mutants . NEM pretreatment blocked dimerization for all three mutants ( Fig . 25E ) , showing that the dimers were indeed formed via a disulfide bond . These data suggest that the α - carbons of the two Cys 165 residues are located close to each other , within 7 Å , the maximum distance to form a Cu - P mediated disulfide bond [ 21 ] . We did not observe any change in dimer ratio upon Cu - P addition with the five mutants spanning residues Y30C to S34C , indicating that those residues are not in close proximity ( Fig 25A , B and Fig . 27 ) . It has been observed that ligand binding can induce a change in the receptor dimer interface ( this Dissertation , Part III ) and [ 22 , 23 ] . To examine the ligand effect on Cys - mediated dimerization at the N - terminus , membranes were incubated with either α - factor or [ desW 1 desH 2 ] α - factor ( an antagonist ) prior to Cu - P treatment . The dimerization of the Q20C and Y26C mutants was not influenced by the presence of either ligand . In contrast , the S22C mutant increased dimerization in the presence of Cu - P and α - factor or the antagonist . While pre - incubation with α - factor did not affect the ratio of dimer for the G21C , T23C and I24C mutants , antagonist pre - treatment of these three mutants resulted in increased Cu - P dependent dimer formation ( Fig . 25 and Fig 27A ) . The presence of ligand also altered the dimer population for the N25C , T27C , and I29C mutants . These three mutants exhibited an increase in dimerization stimulated by the presence of Cu - P . However , pre - treatment with α - factor prior to Cu - P treatment blocked the formation of dimers for these mutants . In contrast , Cu - P stimulated dimerization did occur with antagonist treatment . ( Fig . 25C , D and Fig . 27B ) . These results suggest that the N - terminus dimer interface is changed by ligand binding , with different effects of agonist and antagonist . Once again , no change was observed in the dimer ratio in the presence of agonist or antagonist for the five mutants spanning Y30C to S34C , suggesting that these residues are not components of the dimer interface in the resting or activated receptor ( Fig . 25C , D and Fig . 27C ) . 166 Figure 25 Dimer formation of Cys mutants Membrane proteins untreated ( A ) , treated with Cu - P ( B ) , incubated with α - factor followed by Cu - P ( C ) , incubated with antagonist followed by Cu - P ( D ) or NEM added prior to Cu - P ( E ) were analyzed by SDS - PAGE , then immunoblotted and probed with anti - FLAG antibody .

Within the N - terminus the sequence between residues 19 to 31 was predicted to form a beta strand [ 24 ] . In this dissertation , residues were found that increased dimerization in the absence of Cu - P upon mutation to Cys ( Q20C , S22C , I24C , Y26C , S28C , and Y30C ) . If these residues are localized on one side of the predicted beta strand in the native Ste2p , then this may place them in position to interact with a corresponding beta strand on a second Ste2p molecule . Residues G21 , T23 , N25 , T27 , I29 , and G31 are expected to be located on other side of the beta strand , and these residues when replaced by Cys do not form dimers in the absence of Cu - P . As the collision rate between the two thiols is dependent on the inter - residue distance [ 25 , 26 ] , the odd - numbered residues may not be in close enough proximity to each other to form effective disulfide bonds in the absence of Cu - P . However , dimers are formed in the presence of Cu - P with N25C , T27C , and I29C . We believe that Cu - P functioned to enhance dimerization by providing a more oxidative environment that facilitated disulfide bond formation . We postulate that these receptors are impaired in their glycosylation due to mutation ( N25c and T27C ) in the N - X - T / S motif or a mutation ( I29C ) that affected glycosylation . The lowered glycosylation allows these residues to be in close enough proximity to react when Cu - P is present . This hypothesis needs to be tested by determination of the glycosylation state of these mutant receptors . We did not observe high levels of dimerization for residues N32C , G33C , or S34C in either the presence or 172 absence of Cu - P . Residues N32 , G33 , and S34 are not part of the predicted beta strand , therefore the region containing these residues might not be in close enough proximity to cross - link well . They showed only a small increase ( 1 . 5 fold or less ) in dimer population with or without Cu - P . Prior incubation with α - factor prevented the Cu - P induced increase in dimerization for the N25C , T27C , and I29C mutants , indicating a ligand - dependent change occurred in this region . In contrast , treatment with antagonist , which binds but does not activate the receptor , did not prevent the Cu - P - mediated dimer increase . Alpha - factor binding to the receptor may alter the position of this region of the N - terminus , or cause a distortion in the beta strand which makes the residues unable to interact and form a disulfide bond . Interestingly , the G21C and T23C receptors , which do not form dimers in the presence or absence of α - factor , did display an increased dimer formation in the presence of antagonist . This indicates that the receptor adopts an intermediate conformation between active and inactive state upon antagonist binding , which shifts the G21 and T23 residues into a position favorable for dimer formation . Thus , although phenotypically the antagonist binding maintains the receptor in the inactive state , antagonist can still influence receptor conformation . Taken together , the ligand dependent change of the dimer interface provided significant evidence that the N - termimus of Ste2p is structured and that this structure can be altered either directly in response to ligand binding or indirectly as part of the receptor activation mechanism . 173 CHAPTER 5 Summary and Future direction Summary This dissertation reports the identification of homo - dimer interfaces for Ste2p , the yeast α - factor receptor , a model system for mammalian GPCR peptide hormone receptors . Information regarding ligand - induced change at the dimer interface is reported as well . To identify the dimer interfaces , single cysteine substitutions were introduced into Ste2p , and disulfide - mediated dimerization was assessed . It was determined that one specific residue was involved in dimerization in transmembrane domain 1 ( TM1 ) and 9 residues were involved in dimers formed via TM7 . Interestingly , for the TM7 mutant receptors the formation of dimers decreased in the presence of α - factor , indicating that ligand binding resulted in a conformational change in this domain . Based on these results , it was proposed that the dimer interfaces may differ in the resting and the activated states of the receptor . Furthermore , the pattern of dimer formation resulted in a re - evaluation of the structure of TM7 , indicating that the full TM7 did not behave as a perfect α - helix as predicted by modeling . In addition , residues at N - terminus of Ste2p were also found to participate in dimer formation and surprisingly , dimerization mediated through some of these residues was influenced by the presence of ligands . Future experiments , suggested below , are proposed to provide further details on the dimer structure - function relationship . 174 Whole cell , In vivo , cross - linking The study of dimer formation in this dissertation was done with receptors in membrane preparations . While the receptors in membrane preparations still maintain their native conformation , as determined by receptor binding affinity , whole cell cross - linking would be useful . For these experiments , cross - linking could be assessed in a native , intact cell for residues that are exposed to the extracellular surface . Since we found residues that form dimers at the N - terminus , which is external to the cell membrane , it should be feasible to do in vivo cross - linking with Cu - P by using whole cells expressing those mutants . Such an approach was used recently by Wang and Konopka to identify residues involved in dimerization of Ste2p via the extracellular extracellular surface of the receptor , although N - terminal residues were not investigated [ 27 ] . The effect of whole cell cross - linking on the physiological function of the receptor has not been examined in this dissertation and might shed new light on the biological relevance of receptor dimerization . However , when testing the biological activity of the receptor in an intact cell , the metal toxicity of Cu - P must be considered since copper is toxic at high concentration [ 28 ] . We observed an orange discoloration of the cells after prolonged incubation ( 1 - 2 hrs ) with Cu - P at 2 . 5 µ M . Thus , a future experiment should be determination of concentration of Cu - P which allows cross - linking without toxicity . Alternatively , a chemical cross - linker can be used for the in vivo studies in lieu of Cu - P . Currently , many cross - linkers with a variety of characteristics are commercially available . For example , Shi et al used succinimidyl trans - 4 - ( maleimidylmethyl ) cyclohexane - 1 - carboxylate ( SMCC ) to demonstrate Ste2p dimer and trimer formation [ 29 ] . Another common reagent used to explore protein - protein interactions are the bismaleimide 175 crosslinkers , BMOE , BMB and BMH , used to specifically connect the thiol groups between two Cys residues ( Fig . 28 ) [ 30 - 32 ] . The use of cross - linkers to detect and stabilize protein - protein interactions at the dimer interface in intact cells will contribute to our understanding of dimer structure - function relationships . Furthermore , comparison of results using whole cells with those obtained from membrane preparations will be useful to determine how accurately results obtained with membrane preparations reflect those obtained with the intact cell . 176 Figure 28 Reaction of maleimide - activated compounds to sulfhydryls ( http : / / www . piercenet . com / Objects / View . cfm ? type = File & ID = 0796 ) 177 Study of receptor function and dimer relationship N - terminal mutants that spontaneously dimerize upon introduction of Cys are good candidates to test for the relationship between dimer formation and receptor function . We can compare the biological activities of those mutants to WT without adding oxidizing reagents , which might affect the physiological function of the yeast cell itself . Recently , Shi et al suggested that the N - terminal tail of Ste2p may have a role in modulation of mating , specifically the fusion of the MATa and MAT α cells [ 24 ] . They found that deletion of the first 20 amino acids ( N20 ) of Ste2p led to a decrease in mating efficiency , but had little impact on receptor mediated G1growth arrest . Thus the mutant cells responded properly in the growth arrest assay , indicating that the signal was transduced by the receptor , but the cells failed to physically fuse to form diploids . They also performed targeted scanning mutagenesis and cysteine accessibility studies to investigate the site specific functional contributions of N - terminus . In that study , they identified two highly conserved hydrophobic residues , I24 and I29 , involved in the mating process . The mating activity associated with these sites was shown to be independent of receptor mediated G1 arrest signaling . Interestingly , mutation of either I24 or I29 to Cys dramatically dropped mating abilities of the mutants compared to mutation to Ala . In our study I24C and I29C were found to dimerize more readily than WT . It is possible that disulfide bond formation at these residues may inhibit the proper conformational change necessary for mating ability but not growth arrest . Indeed , it has been observed that the functions of the receptor can be separated . For example , Ste2p - Y266A mutant can bind ligand without triggering the MAPK pathway [ 33 ] . Though all Cys mutants ( of residues Q20C - S34C of the N - terminus ) were found to retain normal 178 function in the growth arrest assay ( personal communication with Seraj Uddin at UT ) , the mating ability of the dimerized mutants have not yet been tested . A comparison of mating competence in WT Ste2p with the N - terminal Cys mutants will contribute to the understanding of the possible roles for dimerization in this GPCR . Relationship of Dimers to Glycosylation State of Ste2p The two residues , N25 and T27 , at the N - terminus , which form dimers upon Cu - P treatment , are known to be within the motif for N - linked glycosylation ( Asn - X - Ser / Thr ) of Ste2p . The role of N - glycosylation in the dimerization of GPCRs has been described previously . In the β 1 - adrenergic receptor , the mutant N15A , which results in the elimination of a glycosylation site , is functional but deficient in dimerization relative to the wild - type receptor [ 34 ] . The roles of N - glycosylation in the dimerization of the human Bradykinin B2 receptor were also examined . It was determined that N - glycosylation participated in stabilization of dimers [ 35 ] . For the epidermal growth factor receptor , receptor - receptor self - association was also reported to be highly dependent on a conformation induced by N - linked glycosylation [ 36 ] . While most GPCRs are known to be N - glycosylated , the functional effects of glycosylation vary significantly from receptor to receptor [ 37 ] , in Ste2p , the nonglycosylated receptor ( N25Q / N32Q ) displayed normal growth arrest activity and subcellular localization , indicating that glycosylation is not important for wild - type receptor signaling activity [ 15 ] . To test whether N - glycosylation has any effect on dimer formation of Ste2p , three forms of the receptor having zero , one or two N - glycosylation 179 sites can be used as templates to carry residue - specific Cys mutations . Dimer formation of the mutants in the glycosylation deficient and WT backgrounds can be compared via Western blot analysis . Alternatively , Cys mutant and WT Ste2p can be compared with respect to disulfide bond formation following treatment with enzymes , such as Endoglycosidase H or PNGase F , which deglycosylate proteins . Study for higher order oligomer of Ste2p Recently , many studies have documented that various classes of GPCRs form dimers and / or even higher order oligomers [ 38 - 41 ] . Consistent with this , TM1 , TM4 , TM7 and the N - terminus were found to serve as dimer interfaces for Ste2p [ 27 , 42 ] leading us to propose the existence of higher - order oligomerization for Ste2p . It is possible that a single receptor can interact simultaneously with two additional receptors , by utilizing different dimer interfaces between the monomers : TM7 and / or TM1 can interact with TM7 and / or TM1 of a second receptor , while TM4 can interact with TM4 of a third receptor to form oligomers . Dimerization via the N - terminus can also occur with either TM1 and / or TM7 interaction to form oligomers . To test this , double Cys mutants containing one Cys in either TM1 or TM7 and another Cys in TM4 can be used . Cross - linking of receptors with Cys substituted simultaneously into both TM1 / or TM7 and TM4 should lead to the formation higher order species that can be identified by 4 - 12 % gradient SDS - gels ( personal communication , George Umanah of the Becker lab ) . Another method that might be used to identify the intrinsic ( non - disulfide mediated ) oligomerization of Ste2p is perfluoro - octanoic acid ( PFO ) - PAGE [ 43 - 46 ] . PFO 180 is a mild detergent . Thus , it maintains interactions within protein oligomers and permits assessment of the native quaternary structure of membrane proteins when it is used to replace SDS in gel electrophoresis . For in vivo testing , biophysical assays such as FRET and protein fragment complementation assay [ 47 ] also can be used . Split fluorescent proteins are not fluorescent when expressed alone , but when fused to proteins in close proximity , they assemble , fluoresce and thus serve to report on molecular proximity . This method has been applied to find higher oligomerization of D2 dopamine receptor . Taken together , all of the methods described above may be used to document and understand further the nature of dimer / higher order oligomerization of Ste2p . Investigation of dimer formation pattern of TM7 mutants in C - terminal tail truncated Ste2p It was observed that consecutive six TM7 residues ( from L291 to A296 ) were all involved in dimer formation of Ste2p in this study and we proposed that this cytoplasmic end of TM7 may not be a typical α - helical structure . It is possible the junction between TM7 and C - terminal tail may be loosend due to the protein interactions with the C - terminal tail of Ste2p which contains around 160 amino acids ( ~ 18 . 5 kDa ) . To test this , Ste2p truncated at residue 304 can be used . Previously , it was shown that truncated Ste2p was still fuctional and able to form dimers [ 48 ] . Single cysteine mutants from L291C to A296C can be constructed in the truncated Ste2p and dimer formation patterns can be compared with those of the full length Ste2p by same methods as performed in this study . 181 List of References for Part IV 1 .
