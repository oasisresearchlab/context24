TRPs : a polymodal family The transient receptor potential ( TRP ) family is a diverse group of channels that regulates cation entry and contributes to a vast variety of physio - logical conditions . There are 28 mammalian TRPs , divided into 6 subfamilies based on ho - mology : canonical ( TRPC1 - 7 ) , vanilloid ( TRPV1 - 6 ) , melastatin ( TRPM1 - 8 ) , ankyrin ( TRPA1 ) , poly - cystin ( TRPP1 - 3 ) and mucolipin ( TRPML1 - 3 ) . All six members share a common structure of six transmembrane domains with a hydrophobic pore located between the fifth and sixth do - mains . Situated in the plasma membrane , TRP channels serve as polymodal integrators due to their activation by a variety of stimuli including temperature , osmolality , mechanical force , chemoattractants and ischemia . One subfamily of the TRP channels is the vanil - loid family , named for their responsiveness to various ligands that possess vanillyl moieties . Within the TRPV family , TRPV1 is the best stud - ied particularly due to its role in nociception . Although first identified as the receptor for cap - saicin , TRPV1 can also be activated endoge - nously by voltage , noxious heat ( > 42°C ) , pH and lipoxygenase products . Endocannabinoids , including anandamide and N - arachidonoyl do - pamine , can activate both TRPV1 and cannabi - noid receptors , indicating the importance of cross - talk mechanisms . TRPV1 nonselectively gates cations ; however , channel activation re - sults in a 10 - fold higher preference for calcium [ 1 ] . One of the most potent agonists of TRPV1 is resiniferatoxin ( RTX ) , a plant toxin that exhib - its 3 - 4X greater potency than capsaicin [ 2 ] . In contrast , its iodinated form , iodo - resiniferatoxin ( I - RTX ) , is a potent antagonist [ 3 ] . The sensitivity of TRPV1 to ligand activation can be modulated by intracellular events and signaling pathways including phosphorylation [ 4 ] . For a more ex - tensive review of TRPV1 pharmacology , see Vriens J et al . and Szallasi A et al . [ 5 , 6 ] . The structure of TRPV1 Structural analysis of TRPV1 indicates a com - pact transmembrane region and a large basket - like intracellular domain [ 7 ] . These regions are formed by six transmembrane domains , a struc - tural feature common to all TRPs , and intracel - Am J Neurodegener Dis 2012 ; 1 ( 1 ) : 1 - 14 www .

Received April 15 , 2012 ; accepted April 21 , 2012 ; Epub April 22 , 2012 ; published May 30 , 2012 Abstract : The transient receptor potential ( TRP ) family comprises a diverse group of cation channels that regulate a variety of intracellular signaling pathways . The TRPV1 ( vanilloid 1 ) channel is best known for its role in nociception and sensory transmission . First studied in the dorsal root ganglia as the receptor for capsaicin , TRPV1 is now recog - nized to have a broader distribution and function within the central nervous system ( CNS ) . Because it can be acti - vated by a range of potentially noxious stimuli , TRPV1’s polymodal nature and ability to interact with other receptor pathways make it a candidate for a stress response protein . As a result , TRPV1 is emerging as a key mediator of CNS function through modulation of both glial and neuronal activity . Growing evidence has suggested that TRPV1 can mediate a variety of pathways from glial reactivity and cytokine release to synaptic transmission and plasticity . This review highlights the increasing importance of TRPV1 as a regulator of CNS function in response to stress . Keywords : TRPV1 , neurodegeneration , capsaicin , CNS , TRP channel , Huntington’s Disease , neuron , glia , plasticity , synaptic transmission TRPV1 and the central nervous system 2 Am J Neurodegener Dis 2012 ; 1 ( 1 ) : 1 - 14 lular N - and C - termini . The N - terminal tail con - tains numerous phosphorylation sites and an - kyrin repeats that serve as binding sites for calmodulin and ATP [ 8 ] . The C - terminal tail con - tains a TRP domain as well as binding sites for both calmodulin and PIP 2 , an endogenous TRPV1 inhibitor [ 9 - 11 ] . Within the extracellular loop domain , the amino acid residues Glu600 and Glu648 can regulate TRPV1 activation by protons , allowing for pH sensitivity [ 12 ] . Agonist activation is also mediated intracellularly , as lipophilic capsaicin readily crosses the mem - brane to bind several sites on TRPV1 [ 13 ] ( Figure 1 ) . Mutation and deletion studies have identified multiple residues critical for activa - tion . Deletion of Thr550 in transmembrane region 4 can reduce capsaicin sensitivity [ 14 ] . Deletion of Arg114 and Glu761 in the N - and C - termini can block capsaicin - induced currents without affecting TRPV1 activation by heat [ 15 ] . Mutations of Tyr511 and Ser512 can abolish capsaicin responses , yet leave activation by Figure 1 . TRPV1 is a member of the transient receptor potential family . TRPV1 consists of six transmembrane do - mains with a pore region between the fifth and sixth domain , and long intracellular N - and C - terminal tails . Within the N - terminal tail , six ankyrin repeat domains allow binding of calmodulin and ATP to modulate TRPV1 activation . The C - terminus contains a TRP domain as well as binding sites for PIP2 and calmodulin . Throughout TRPV1 are mul - tiple phosphorylation sites for PKA , PKC and CaMKII , in addition to putative sites for capsaicin and proton binding . TRPV1 : transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 , TM : transmembrane , aa : amino acid , CaM : calmodulin , ATP : adeno - sine triphosphate , PIP2 : phosphoinositide 4 , 5 - bisphosphate , PKA : protein kinase A , PKC : protein kinase C , CamKII : Ca2 + / calmodulin dependent kinase II . TRPV1 and the central nervous system 3 Am J Neurodegener Dis 2012 ; 1 ( 1 ) : 1 - 14 heat and protons intact [ 16 ] . Functional TRPV1 preferentially forms a homo - tetramer but can also oligermerize with other TRP family subunits including TRPV3 and TRPA1 [ 7 , 17 , 18 ] . The affinity and specificity of the subunit interactions is determined by amino acids in the transmembrane domains and the C - terminus . In chimeric studies , replacement of the N - and C - termini of TRPV1 with that of TRPV4 did not prevent the formation of TRPV1 tetramers , suggesting a role for the transmem - brane region in oligomerization [ 19 ] . Deletion studies , however , have shown that the C - terminal TRP domain ( 684Glu - 721Arg ) regu - lates the formation of functional channel tetramers [ 9 ] . Removal of this region prevents the oligomeriza - tion into stable TRPV1 heteromers . TRPV1 is a cation channel , and its selectivity filter is believed to lie in the pore domain formed by trans - membrane regions 5 and 6 . Site - specific analysis has shown that substitutions of Asp646 or Tyr671 in the pore domain can reduce the permeability of divalent cations [ 20 , 21 ] . This cation selectivity is dy - namic , not static , and can vary de - pending on stimulus duration or agonist concentration . Activation can alter the calcium permeability and pore diameter of TRPV1 to al - low influx of larger cations [ 1 ] . SCAM ( substituted cysteine accessi - bility method ) has shown this change in permeability is mediated by amino acid residues in trans - membrane domain 6 . Within this domain , Leu681 can regulate per - meability of large cations , while Tyr671 gates access of smaller cations [ 22 ] . The method of chan - nel stimulation can also have a sig - nificant effect on calcium perme - ability — activation by protons pro - duces a smaller calcium current than activation by capsaicin [ 23 ] . Regulation of TRPV1 In addition to membrane expres - sion , TRPV1 is also found in the endoplasmic reticulum where it mo - bilizes calcium from intracellular stores [ 24 , 25 ] . Activation of signaling pathways can trans - locate TRPV1 from intracellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum to the mem - brane usually via phosphorylation . For example , PKC activation can lead to membrane insertion of TRPV1 via SNARE - mediated exocytosis [ 26 ] . cAMP - dependent activation of PKA can rapidly translocate monomeric TRPV1 from intracellular compartments to form the functional channel at the plasma membrane [ 27 ] . Furthermore , nerve growth factor activation of the tyrosine kinase src can phosphorylate TRPV1 at Y200 to increase membrane levels of TRPV1 [ 28 ] ( Figure 2 ) . Insulin growth factors can also in - Figure 2 . Interaction with other signaling pathways can traffic TRPV1 to the plasma membrane . TrkA stimulation by NGF can cause src - mediated phosphorylation of TRPV1 to traffic TRPV1 from the endo - plasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane . Translocation of TRPV1 to the membrane can also be increased through PKA - and PKC - mediated phosphorylation . Dephosphorylation by SHP - 1 , however , can inhibit translocation . NGF : nerve growth factor , PIP3 : phosphatidy - linositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate , PI3K : phosphoinositide 3 kinase TRPV1 and the central nervous system 4 Am J Neurodegener Dis 2012 ; 1 ( 1 ) : 1 - 14 crease membrane expression and potentiation of TRPV1 via PKC - mediated phosphorylation [ 29 ] . Phosphorylation is also important in modulating the channel , allowing for rapid responses to external stimuli or environmental changes . Generally , phosphorylation sensitizes while dephosphorylation desensitizes the channel . PKC phosphorylation at Ser800 reverses desen - sitization of TRPV1 from prolonged capsaicin treatment and increases the sensitivity of TRPV1 to agonists [ 30 , 31 ] . Forskolin - mediated activation of PKA can decrease capsaicin - induced desensitization of TRPV1 , a phenome - non that is blocked by a PKA inhibitor [ 32 ] . PKA can also reduce desensitization by direct phos - phorylation of TRPV1 at Ser116 [ 33 ] . In addi - tion , PKC or PKA activation through stimulation of multiple receptors including the protease - activated receptor PAR2 , bradykinin B1 and B2 , purinergic P2 receptors , chemokine receptor CCL3 and endothelin receptors have all been shown to increase sensitivity of the channel [ 34 - 38 ] ( Figure 3 ) . Src kinase , CamKII and PI3K can all phosphorylate TRPV1 and increase sen - sitivity as well [ 28 , 29 , 39 ] . On the other hand , dephosphorylation by calcineurin / PP2B and increases in intracellular calcium can desensi - tize the channel [ 40 , 41 ] . TRPV1 in the CNS Although it is expressed throughout the CNS , TRPV1 is most robust in the sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion [ 42 ] . Using a combina - tion of knockout mice , radioligand binding and immunocytochemistry , TRPV1 expression within the CNS has been documented . These studies localize TRPV1 mainly to the hippocampus and cortex with additional expression in hypothala - mus , olfactory nuclei , dentate gyrus , locus coe - ruleus , superior colliculus and spinal cord [ 43 , 44 ] . These observations of widespread TRPV1 Figure 3 . TRPV1 is a polymodal cation channel . TRPV1 can be activated by a variety of noxious stimuli such as heat , pH and pressure , and its interaction with other receptors including G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) contributes to its polymodal nature . GPCR activation can directly lead to recruitment of PKC and PKA , through phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase respectively , to phosphorylate TRPV1 and sensitize the channel . Elevations in intracellular cal - cium from TRPV1 and GPCR stimulation can activate calcineurin and CaMKII via calmodulin to further modulate TRPV1 activity . GPCR : G - protein coupled receptors , AC : adenylyl cyclase , cAMP : cyclic AMP , CaN : calcineurin , DAG : diacylglycerol , PIP2 : phosphoinositide 4 , 5 - bisphosphate , IP3 : inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate , PLC : phospholipase C , ER : endoplasmic reticulum . TRPV1 and the central nervous system 5 Am J Neurodegener Dis 2012 ; 1 ( 1 ) : 1 - 14 expression , however , are contested by a TRPV1 reporter mouse that indicates limited expres - sion in the CNS outside of nociceptors in the sensory ganglia . CNS expression was restricted to the posterior caudal hypothalamus , the ros - tral midbrain , the periaqueductal grey and the hippocampus [ 45 ] . Although there is discrep - ancy regarding the exact distribution of TRPV1 , it can be appreciated that CNS expression of TRPV1 indicates a broader function of the chan - nel beyond sensory transmission . Subcellularly , TRPV1 expression has been found in cell bodies and synapses , predominantly on the post - synaptic dendritic spines of neurons and also in synaptic vesicles [ 44 , 46 ] . TRPV1 is also highly expressed in the cell bodies and neu - rites of both sensory neurons and neurons dif - ferentiated by induction with retinoic acid [ 47 , 48 ] . Retinal ganglion cells also exhibit TRPV1 expression in somas and in discrete pockets in axons [ 49 ] . In addition to neurons , TRPV1 pro - tein has also been found in glia including astro - cytes and microglia [ 50 , 51 ] . TRPV1 in pain and inflammation TRPV1 is highly expressed in the dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) , where it mediates sensory per - ception especially in nociception where it has been extensively studied . TRPV1 is best charac - terized as the receptor for capsaicin , an ingredi - ent in chili peppers known to elicit a burning sensation and pain [ 52 ] . Within the dorsal root ganglion , TRPV1 expression is localized to the C - and A δ - fibers . Here , channel activation leads to calcium elevations and subsequent release of neuropeptides including calcitonin - gene - related peptide and substance P [ 52 - 54 ] . TRPV1 can also be activated by noxious heat ( > 43°C ) indicating a role in transducing thermal pain and hyperalgesia [ 52 ] . Furthermore , TRPV1 - null mice display a reduced response to vanilloid stimulation , thermosensation and hy - peralgesia [ 55 ] . Inflammation has been linked to TRPV1 - mediated nociception . Intradermal injection of capsaicin can cause pain and hyperalgesia in humans in a dose - dependent manner [ 56 ] . Following injection of Complete Freund’s Adju - vant ( CFA ) , TRPV1 protein levels increase in the DRG and the channels are transported to the peripheral nociceptive terminals [ 57 ] . Oral ad - ministration of TRPV1 antagonists reduces cap - saicin or CFA - induced pain behavior , hyperalge - sia and mechanical allodynia in rodents [ 58 ] . Many proinflammatory factors including sub - stance P , nerve growth factor , bradykinin , pros - taglandins and ATP can potentiate and sensitize TRPV1 [ 36 , 59 - 61 ] . Activation of TRPV1 can also mediate the release of inflammatory me - diators such as IL - 6 [ 51 ] . The role of TRPV1 in pain and inflammation has been extensively examined in other reviews [ 62 - 66 ] . TRPV1 in behavior TRPV1 has been associated with changes in - duced by drug treatment , addiction , anxiety and depression . Intraperitoneal injections of methamphetamine increase TRPV1 mRNA in the frontal cortex , but not the striatum or hippo - campus [ 67 ] . Morphine injections also increase TRPV1 expression in the DRG , spinal cord and sciatic nerve through the activation of the MAPK pathway . Inhibition of TRPV1 with SB366791 reduces morphine tolerance and thermal hyper - algesia , suggesting that TRPV1 is involved in the effects of chronic morphine treatments [ 68 ] . In addition to changes in expression levels , TRPV1 can also mediate behavioral effects of drug - induced addiction . In a model of cocaine - induced addiction , the TRPV1 antagonist SB366791 did not affect cocaine self - administration , but did reduce the cocaine - induced reinstatement of cocaine - seeking be - havior ; this suggests TRPV1 activity is not nec - essary for the reward response of cocaine , but may play a role in cocaine relapse [ 69 ] . TRPV1 - null mice or mice treated with capsazepine , a TRPV1 antagonist , have a higher preference for ethanol and faster recovery from ethanol - induced effects . TRPV1 activation by capsaicin , however , produces opposite effects – lower preference for and slower recovery from ethanol [ 70 ] . In mice , nicotine - induced depression can be reduced by TRPV1 agonists , capsaicin and olvanil , as seen in the forced swim test ( increased swimming ) and tail suspension test ( increased mobility time ) , indicating TRPV1 can counter some nicotine - induced effects [ 71 ] . Besides addiction , TRPV1 can mediate anxiety - induced behavior . TRPV1 inhibition by cap - sazepine injections into the medial prefrontal cortex of rats increase exploration time in the elevated plus maze and the number of licks in the Vogel conflict test , indicating an anxiolytic TRPV1 and the central nervous system 6 Am J Neurodegener Dis 2012 ; 1 ( 1 ) : 1 - 14 effect with TRPV1 antagonism [ 72 ] . TRPV1 - null mice exhibit less anxiety , as determined by the elevated plus maze and increased exploration of the illuminated side of the light - dark test [ 73 ] . Interestingly , TRPV1 - null mice also show less fear - conditioned responses , which correlate with a decrease in long term potentiation , sug - gesting that TRPV1 promotes fear [ 73 ] . Con - versely , intraperitoneal injections of a TRPV1 agonist , olvanil , decreased the time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze , further linking TRPV1 activation to induction of anxiety behavior [ 74 ] . TRPV1 in glial function Under conditions of stress and injury glia can become reactive , demonstrating increased hy - pertrophy , production and secretion of cytokines and changes in gene expression . In addition to neurons , TRPV1 is also found in astrocytes and microglia , and emerging studies have impli - cated TRPV1 in various aspects of glial function . TRPV1 is expressed in astrocytes in the spinal cord , retina and various brain regions [ 44 , 50 , 75 ] . However , immunolabeling indicates that only a subset of astrocytes in the substantia nigra is TRPV1 - positive [ 76 ] . In TRPV1 - null mice , spinal astrocytes and microglia both dem - onstrate reduced Iba - 1 and GFAP immunostain - ing in response to capsaicin and CFA injections and partial sciatic nerve ligation [ 77 ] . This sug - gests that TRPV1 may mediate gliosis under conditions of inflammatory and neuropathic pain . Injections of capsaicin increase GFAP lev - els in acutely axotomized retinas that can be blocked with capsazepine [ 78 ] . Acid - induced activation of TRPV1 is associated with increases in channel permeability to sodium rather than calcium in cortical astrocytes [ 79 ] . TRPV1 also mediates microglial function . The TRPV1 antagonist , WIN - 55 , 212 - 2 reduces mi - croglial activation but can also stimulate the cannabinoid 1 and 2 receptors to increase hip - pocampal neurogenesis [ 80 ] . WIN - 55 , 212 - 2 treatments can decrease production of pro - inflammatory cytokines ( TNF α , IL - 1 β , IL - 6 ) and increase the anti - inflammatory cytokine IL1 - RA , suggesting the participation of TRPV1 in hippo - campal inflammation [ 80 ] . TRPV1 antagonism can reduce increases in microglial IL - 6 secretion and intracellular calcium induced by elevations in hydrostatic pressure [ 51 ] . Capsaicin treat - ments can also up - regulate bradykinin B1 re - ceptor levels in rat spinal cord microglia . This up - regulation correlates with increases in spinal cord IL - 1 β mRNA levels [ 81 ] . Moreover , phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate - stimulated production of reactive oxygen species in microglia can be reduced with TRPV1 antagonists including cap - sazepine and I - RTX , further suggesting that TRPV1 is involved in microglia - induced inflam - mation [ 82 ] . Emerging studies have suggested TRPV1 might be involved in cell migration . Capsaicin induces dendritic cells of the immune system to migrate to lymph nodes , a result that is absent in TRPV1 - null mice [ 83 ] . TRPV1 also enhances hepato - cyte growth factor - induced migration of hepato - blastoma cells [ 84 ] . Capsaicin can also in - crease migration of corneal epithelial cells by 1 . 65X in a scratch - wound model of migration through the transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor [ 85 ] . Furthermore , TRPV1 can interact with the cytoskeleton , sug - gesting that the channel might be involved in cytoskeletal changes that occur during cell movement . Tubulin dimers can directly bind the C - terminus of TRPV1 , an interaction that stabi - lizes microtubules under depolymerizing condi - tions [ 86 ] . TRPV1 activation by capsaicin or RTX can cause rapid depolymerization of micro - tubules through an increase in intracellular cal - cium [ 87 , 88 ] . In addition , TRPV1 has been found in growth cones where it mediates their retraction through microtubule disassembly [ 89 ] . TRPV1 has also been shown to localize to filopodial tips where it mediates filopodial initia - tion and elonglation [ 46 ] . By directly interacting with cytoskeletal elements , TPRV1 can mediate glial migration and chemotaxis during stress and injury . TRPV1 in neuronal function Growth cones are incredibly dynamic and un - dergo rapid directional changes in response to a chemical gradient . Localized elevations in cal - cium at the growth cone can induce extension and turning by activating CaMKII for attraction and calcineurin for repulsion [ 90 , 91 ] . Neurite outgrowth is also believed to be calcium de - pendent . By interacting with microtubule kinase MARK2 , CaMKI is able to induce neurite out - growth under conditions of increased intracellu - lar calcium [ 92 ] . Ionomycin - induced increases in calcium can activate CamKIV , resulting in TRPV1 and the central nervous system 7 Am J Neurodegener Dis 2012 ; 1 ( 1 ) : 1 - 14 phosphorylation of cofilin and subsequent re - modeling of the actin cytoskeleton and initiation of neurite outgrowth [ 93 ] . As a calcium - selective cation channel , TRPV1 is also involved in neurite outgrowth and growth cone dynamics . In retinoic acid - induced differentiation of neuro - blastoma cells into neurons , TRPV1 is upregu - lated in both cell bodies and developing neu - rites [ 47 ] . Activation of TRPV1 can also induce the formation of varicosities along neurites and retraction of growth cones through microtubule disassembly in a dorsal root ganglia cell line [ 89 ] . Another member of the TRP family , TRPC5 is expressed in the growth cones of hippocam - pal neurons , and expression of dominant - negative TRPC5 results in longer neurites and filopodia [ 94 ] . In addition to growth cones and neurites , TRPV1 also localizes to synapses , and emerging stud - ies indicate the channel can modulate synaptic transmission . In a DRG cell line , TRPV1 colocal - izes with synaptic proteins at filopodia tips , where activation results in vesicle fusion . This activity suggests that TRPV1 modulates neuro - transmitter release [ 46 ] . For example , capsai - cin can activate a subset of neurons in the soli - tary tract to induce an inward current and an increase in spontaneous activity to facilitate glutamate release [ 95 ] . TRPV1 , by modulating calcium levels , is required for asynchronous glutamate release from solitary tract neurons [ 96 ] . Furthermore , in DRG and spinal cord co - cultures as well as slices from substantia nigra and hypothalamus , capsaicin increases pre - synaptic calcium to enhance presynaptic activity and glutamate release [ 97 - 99 ] . In addition to glutamate release , TRPV1 has also been impli - cated in dopamine release . In the ventral teg - mental area , capsaicin enhances both the re - lease of dopamine at the nucleus accumbens and also the firing of dopaminergic neurons [ 100 ] . In TRPV1 - transfected neuroblastoma cells , capsaicin treatments elevate intracellular calcium levels to increase release of [ 3 H ] norepinephrine from secretory vesicles [ 101 ] . In the peripheral nervous system , capsaicin - induced calcium increases lead to the release of neuropeptides substance P and calcitonin - gene related peptide [ 53 , 54 ] . TRPV1 in synaptic transmission and plasticity By altering synaptic calcium levels and neuro - transmitter release , TRPV1 can modulate synap - tic transmission . In spinal cord slices from rats injected with Freund’s complete adjuvant , the TRPV1 antagonist , SB - 366791 decreases the frequency but not amplitude of spontaneous and miniature excitatory post - synaptic currents ( EPSCs ) [ 102 ] . In striatal medium spiny neu - rons and sensory neurons , TRPV1 enhances the frequency of glutamatergic EPSCs that were potentiated by PKC - mediated decrease in de - sensitization [ 103 , 104 ] . TRPV1 - mediated in - creases in EPSC frequencies have also been observed in the substantia gelatinosa , periaque - ductal gray , medial preoptic nucleus , substantia nigra and locus coeruleus [ 98 , 105 - 108 ] . By modulating synaptic transmission , TRPV1 can influence synaptic plasticity and survival . In hippocampal neurons , TRPV1 activation by cap - saicin or 12 - ( S ) - HPETE is necessary to cause long term depression ( LTD ) by high frequency stimulation . This effect was notably absent in TRPV1 - null mice [ 109 ] . As a result of this find - ing , the authors propose a model in which gluta - mate induces post - synaptic release of 12 - ( S ) - HPETE into the synaptic cleft to activate pre - synaptic TRPV1 channels . Activated TRPV1 sub - sequently decreases pre - synaptic glutamate release through a calcium - dependent pathway ( Figure 4 ) . Another study found that in the den - tate gyrus and in the medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens , post - synaptic activa - tion of TRPV1 by anandamide leads to LTD through calcium - mediated endocytosis of AMPA receptors [ 110 , 111 ] ( Figure 4 ) . In the develop - ing superior colliculus , I - RTX blocks the induc - tion of tetanus - induced LTD , while RTX reduces the amplitude of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials [ 112 ] . In TRPV1 - null mice , there was a reduction in long term potentiation ( LTP ) com - pared to wildtype mice in the CA1 region of the hippocampus [ 73 ] . These previous studies indi - cate that TRPV1 facilitates LTD ; however , an - other study found that capsaicin and RTX ampli - fied LTP and suppressed LTD in the CA1 region of the hippocampus [ 113 ] . TRPV1 in neurodegeneration Associated with increases in intracellular cal - cium , overactivation of TRPV1 can be toxic to cells . Capsaicin leads to elevated levels of in - tracellular calcium and subsequent mitochon - drial damage and apoptosis in both cultured cortical microglia and mesencephalic neuronal cultures [ 114 , 115 ] . Capsaicin can also induce TRPV1 and the central nervous system 8 Am J Neurodegener Dis 2012 ; 1 ( 1 ) : 1 - 14 apoptosis of cultured retinal ganglion cells in a dose - dependent manner [ 49 ] . Likewise , intrani - gral injections of capsaicin lead to death of dopaminergic neurons through calcium - mediated mitochondrial damage . This damage can be reduced by coinjections of capsazepine [ 115 ] . Moreover , capsaicin triggers apoptosis in cortical neurons through ERK phosphoryla - tion , activation of caspases and production of reactive oxygen species [ 116 ] . TRPV1 has also been found in gliomas , where its activation by capsaicin leads to cell death through calcium - induced mitochondrial damage and p38 activa - tion [ 117 ] . The association between TRPV1 and cell death is further supported by the ability of I - RTX to block pressure - induced apoptosis of cul - tured retinal ganglion cells [ 49 ] . Because TRPV1 can initiate calcium - dependent apoptosis of neuronal and glial cell types , TRPV1 has been implicated in neurodegenera - tion . In an ischemic model of glaucoma in - duced by high intraocular pressure , both CB1 and TRPV1 protein levels are upregulated . Treatment with a stable anandamide analogue reduces retinal ganglion cell loss , an effect that is diminished with CB1 and TRPV1 antagonists [ 118 ] . This suggests that endocannabinoid binding to CB1 or TRPV1 is neuroprotective . Similarly , in a gerbil model of global transient ischemia , capsaicin and the CB1 receptor an - tagonist rimonabant can both improve locomo - tor activity , memory and the number of neurons in the CA1 hippocampus . This effect is dimin - ished with capsazepine pre - treatment , suggest - ing that TPRV1 is neuroprotective during ische - mia [ 119 , 120 ] . Capsaicin has also exhibited a neuroprotective function in ouabain - mediated excitotoxicity [ 121 ] . This protection may be me - diated by rapid agonist - induced desensitization of TRPV1 , as TRPV1 antagonism by capsazepine was also neuroprotective and could reduce brain damage . TRPV1 has also been implicated in Huntington’s disease ( HD ) , a genetic neurodegenerative dis - order characterized by cell death in the basal ganglia . HD arises from the expansion of the polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein , causing gain - of - function . The symptoms of HD include motor defects as well as cognitive and psychiatric problems . In a 3 - nitropropionic acid - induced model of Huntington’s disease , the endocannabinoid ligand AM404 is able to re - duce hyperkinesia [ 122 ] . This phenomenon can be reversed by capsazepine , but not by the CB1 antagonist SR141716A , suggesting that TRPV1 Figure 4 . TRPV1 contributes to synaptic plasticity . As a calcium cation channel , TRPV1 has been implicated in synaptic plasticity , especially in facilitating long term depression . ( A ) Activation of mGluR by gluta - mate triggers the synthesis and release of 12 - ( S ) HPETE into the extracellular milieu . 12 - ( S ) HPETE activates pre - synaptic TRPV1 , and through a calcium - mediated pathway , glutamate release is blocked . ( B ) mGluR activation can also lead to production and release of anandamide . Anandamide binds post - synaptic TRPV1 to cause endocytosis of AMPA recep - tors , or to pre - synaptic cannabinoid receptors to in - hibit glutamate release . 12 - HPETE : 12 ( S ) - hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid , LOX12 : 12 - Lipoxygenase , CB1 : cannabinoid receptor TRPV1 and the central nervous system 9 Am J Neurodegener Dis 2012 ; 1 ( 1 ) : 1 - 14 activation can reduce locomotion . Capsaicin itself is antihyperkinetic and can restore dopa - mine and GABA transmission in the basal gan - glia [ 122 ] . Furthermore , intraperitoneal injec - tions of capsaicin into rats reduce ambulation and stereotypic behavior and increase inactivity time during open field testing [ 123 ] . These studies indicate that drugs targeting TRPV1 might be beneficial to patients diagnosed with HD . Conclusion Emerging studies have shown that TRPV1 has a broader range of function and distribution than once thought . Although it is best characterized for its importance in nociception , expression of TRPV1 in the CNS indicates it may serve a role beyond that in sensory transmission . In combi - nation with its polymodal nature and sensitivity to noxious stimuli , TRPV1 may be an ideal can - didate as a stress response protein . By inte - grating multiple signaling pathways , TRPV1 can modulate intracellular calcium levels to mobilize the cell’s response to stress and injury . As a result , TRPV1 has been implicated in both glial and neuronal function . TRPV1 can mediate gliosis , cytokine levels and cytoskeletal rear - rangements . In addition , TRPV1 modulates neurotransmitter release , synaptic transmis - sion , synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration .
