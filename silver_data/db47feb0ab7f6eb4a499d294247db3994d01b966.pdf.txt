ABSTRACT The role of clathrin light chain ( CLC ) in clathrin - mediated endocytosis is not com - pletely understood . Previous studies showed that the CLC N - terminus ( CLC - NT ) binds the Hip1 / Hip1R / Sla2 family of membrane / actin – binding factors and that overexpression of the CLC - NT in yeast suppresses endocytic defects of clathrin heavy - chain mutants . To elucidate the mechanistic basis for this suppression , we performed synthetic genetic array analysis with a clathrin CLC - NT deletion mutation ( clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 ) . clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 suppressed the internalization defects of null mutations in three late endocytic factors : amphiphysins ( rvs161 and rvs167 ) and verprolin ( vrp1 ) . In actin sedimentation assays , CLC binding to Sla2 inhibited Sla2 interac - tion with F - actin . Furthermore , clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 suppression of the rvs and vrp phenotypes re - quired the Sla2 actin - binding talin - Hip1 / R / Sla2 actin - tethering C - terminal homology domain , suggesting that clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 promotes internalization by prolonging actin engagement by Sla2 . We propose that CLC directs endocytic progression by pruning the Sla2 - actin attach - ments in the clathrin lattice , providing direction for membrane internalization . INTRODUCTION Clathrin is a major coat protein involved in vesicle formation during receptor - mediated endocytosis and sorting in the trans - Golgi net - work ( TGN ) / endosomal system ( Traub , 2005 ) . Clathrin is found as a triskelion containing three extended heavy chains ( CHCs ) trimerized at their C - termini and three light chains ( CLCs ) . These assemble into a characteristic polyhedral coat on the cytosolic face of the mem - brane to facilitate clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) formation . CHC in - teracts with adaptor proteins , which are involved in recruitment of clathrin to the membrane , as well as the binding to and sorting of cargo . Although the role of CHC in CCV formation is well estab - lished , the roles of CLC are not completely understood . Previous work showed that CLCs bind along the vertex - proximal region of the CHC leg and are found on the outer surface of the clathrin lattice , where they are positioned to interact with other cy - tosolic and regulatory factors ( Fotin et al . , 2004 ) . They are important for stabilization of the mammalian triskelion hub fragments in vitro ( Ybe et al . , 2003 , 2007 ) and are essential for CHC trimerization in yeast ( Chu et al . , 1996 ; Huang et al . , 1997 ) . Biochemical studies also show that CLC inhibits spontaneous triskelion self - assembly ( Ungewickell and Ungewickell , 1991 ; Liu et al . , 1995 ) , and this activ - ity depends on the conserved N - terminal acidic region of CLC ( Ybe et al . , 1998 ) . Recent work suggested that interaction of CLC or the CLC amino terminus with CHC might prevent the bending of the CHC knee that is required for lattice assembly ( Wilbur et al . , 2010 ) . However , depletion of CLC or overexpression of CLC lacking the N - terminal regulatory domain in animal cells has little effect on en - docytosis , although some effect on TGN / endosomal sorting has been observed ( Huang et al . , 2004 ; Chen and Brodsky , 2005 ; Poupon et al . , 2008 ; Wilbur et al . , 2008 ) . The CLC N - terminal acidic region also interacts with the central coil - coiled dimerization domain of the Hip1 / Hip1R / Sla2 family of proteins ( Chen and Brodsky , 2005 ; Legendre - Guillemin et al . , 2005 ; Newpher et al . , 2006 ) . Some evidence suggests that Hip1 / R bind - ing to CLC promotes clathrin assembly by releasing the CLC Monitoring Editor Sandra L .

Molecular Biology of the Cell N - terminal negative regulation on CHC ( Chen and Brodsky , 2005 ; Legendre - Guillemin et al . , 2005 ) . Because Hip1 - related proteins contain both an AP180 N - terminal homology domain ( ANTH ) that binds membrane - associated phosphatidyl inositides and a talin / Hip1 / R / Sla2 actin - tethering C - terminal homology domain ( THATCH ) that binds F - actin , they may provide a critical link between the membrane and the actin cytoskeleton or regulate actin assembly during clathrin - mediated transport ( McCann and Craig , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 1999 ; Legendre - Guillemin et al . , 2002 ; Hyun et al . , 2004 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ; Sun et al . , 2005 ; Brett et al . , 2006 ; Wilbur et al . , 2008 ) . Depletion of Hip1 family proteins from cells leads to aberrant actin assemblies at clathrin - coated membranes in both yeast and animal cells ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2004 ; Newpher et al . , 2005 ; Le Clainche et al . , 2007 ; Poupon et al . , 2008 ) , and similarly treatments that affect the ability of CLC to interact with Hip1R in animal cells perturb actin structures at clathrin - coated membranes ( Chen and Brodsky , 2005 ; Poupon et al . , 2008 ; Wilbur et al . , 2008 ; Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) . Still , the role of CLC regulation of Hip1 family proteins remains unclear . Yeast provides elegant ways to address these questions by com - bining live - cell imaging with powerful molecular genetic tools . This model system has established a spatiotemporal map from recruit - ment to disassembly and is now elucidating details about the mo - lecular functions of a large number of endocytic factors . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis in yeast takes place at cortical patches and involves many factors that have animal cell counterparts ( Engqvist - Goldstein and Drubin , 2003 ; Robertson et al . , 2009 ; Galletta et al . , 2010 ) . Generally the process has an immobile stage for establishing the endocytic site and a rapid , mobile phase when invagination and vesicle formation occur . During the immobile phase ( 1 – 2 min ) sev - eral endocytic coat factors and adaptors collect at a cortical patch , including the F - BAR domain protein Syp1 ( FCHO1 / FCHO2 homo - logue ) , Ede1 ( an Eps15 homology [ EH ] domain protein ) , and clathrin ( Newpher et al . , 2005 ; Boettner et al . , 2009 ; Reider et al . , 2009 ; Stimpson et al . , 2009 ) . Later in the immobile phase Sla2 ( Hip1 / Hip1R ) appears , followed by Sla1 ( an SH3 domain – containing pro - tein ) , the two EH domain factors Pan1 and End3 , and the WASp homologue , Las17 ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 , 2005 ; Newpher and Lemmon , 2006 ) . Many actin - binding or - remodeling proteins , such as Abp1 , capping protein , and Arp2 / 3 complex , appear or are acti - vated during the mobile phase , which lasts only 10 – 15 s ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 , 2005 ) . At the onset of the mobile phase , the WIP homo - logue , verprolin ( Vrp1 ) , localizes to the cortical site , where it recruits and activates the type - I myosins ( Myo3 / 5 ) , which are potent Arp2 / 3 activators believed to produce a final burst of actin needed to drive invagination ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 , 2005 ; Jonsdottir and Li , 2004 ; Sun et al . , 2006 ; Galletta et al . , 2008 ) . When the patch has invagi - nated ∼200 – 300 nm , the vesicle pinches off , facilitated by the N - BAR domain amphiphysin homologues Rvs161 and Rvs167 , uncoating occurs , and the vesicle associated with actin moves deeper into the cell ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 , 2005 ) . Here we explore how the CLC N - terminus ( CLC - NT ) regulates the yeast Hip1R homologue , Sla2 . Sla2 arrives at endocytic sites well after clathrin , so it is not required for assembly of clathrin ( Newpher et al . , 2006 ; Newpher and Lemmon , 2006 ) . As in mammalian cells , deletion of SLA2 leads to accumulation of early coat factors at the cortex and unproductive actin comet tails emanating from these sites ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Newpher et al . , 2005 ) . Our previous work discovered that CLC1 , which encodes CLC , is a high - copy sup - pressor of clathrin HC – deficient ( chc1 Δ ) yeast , indicating that CLC possesses regulatory functions during endocytosis ( Huang et al . , 1997 ) . Furthermore , we isolated Sla2 as a CLC - interacting protein ( Henry et al . , 2002 ) ; as in animal cells , the yeast CLC - NT interacts with the coiled - coiled domain of Sla2 ( Newpher et al . , 2006 ; Newpher and Lemmon , 2006 ) . Of interest , overexpression of the N - terminal Sla2 - binding region of CLC suppresses the endocytic phenotypes of clathrin - null mutants , including progression of stalled Sla2 - containing endocytic patches ( Newpher et al . , 2006 ) . However , deletion of the CLC - NT alone has minimal effect on its own , likely due to redundancy of the endocytic machinery . To further investigate the regulatory role of CLC during endo - cytic progression we took advantage of the genome - wide synthetic genetic array ( SGA ) approach ( Tong and Boone , 2006 ) , using a clc1 mutant encoding CLC lacking the Sla2 - binding region ( clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 ) as the query strain . To our surprise , the clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 allele alleviated growth defects of null mutants for three late endocytic factors : ver - prolin ( Vrp1 ) and the amphiphysins ( Rvs161 and Rvs167 ) . Our analy - sis of this suppression by live - cell imaging , combined with biochem - ical evidence , suggests that CLC negatively regulates Sla2 binding to the actin cytoskeleton to restrict the number and / or location of Sla2’s actin attachments to promote internalization . RESULTS Synthetic genetic array analysis with clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 We present the first SGA screen performed on a clathrin mutant . Genetic analysis of clathrin mutants previously were limited to small - scale screens ( Bensen et al . , 2000 , 2001 ) , and large - scale SGA analysis was not done because clathrin - null yeast ( clc1 Δ or chc1 Δ ) exhibit massive polyploidy ( Lemmon et al . , 1990 ; Huang et al . , 1997 ) , which renders them unreliable participants in these screens . To explore the mechanism of CLC regulation of endocytosis , we generated a strain ( SL5677 ) for SGA analysis carrying an integrated mutation , clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 , encoding CLC lacking the Sla2 - binding res - idues ( Figure 1A ) . CLC expression from clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 was essentially the same as from wild - type CLC1 ; however , clathrin HC levels ap - peared to be slightly decreased in these cells ( Figure 1 , B and C ) . Except for a slight cold sensitivity ( unpublished data ) , clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 yeast were similar to wild - type yeast in all tests performed ( see later discussion ) . For SGA analysis clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 was first systematically crossed to a collection of 177 temperature - sensitive ( ts ) alleles enriched for genes encoding proteins involved in membrane trafficking , endocy - tosis , and actin function ( listed in Supplemental Table S1B ) . This screen identified 11 genes whose mutations caused synthetic growth defects in the presence of the clc1 mutation , including the endocytic coat factor Pan1 and the Arp2 / 3 complex subunit Arp3 ( Figure 1G ) , although the latter showed major differences , depend - ing on the arp3 allele , and might be complicated by additional func - tions of the Arp2 / 3 complex , for example , mitochondrial movement ( Boldogh et al . , 2001 ) . We confirmed the pan1 genetic interaction with an additional allele , pan1 - 20 , which was in fact synthetic lethal with clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 ( Supplemental Figure S1A ) . A larger - scale SGA screen involved crossing the clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 mutant to 3885 strains from the viable deletion collection . This screen identified 336 ag - gravating mutations ( synthetic growth phenotypes ; Supplemental Table S3B ) and 58 mutants whose growth phenotypes were allevi - ated by clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 ( synthetic rescue phenotypes ; Table 1A and Supplemental Table S3A ) . Gene ontology categories were used to sort the data set by bio - chemical processes ( Supplemental Table S2 ) . Fifteen percent of genes identified by the deletion screen were associated with the Gene Ontology term “vesicle transport , ” in vast excess of the ex - pected 5 % found in the genome ( p ≤ 7 × 10 −11 ) .

TABLE 1 : Selected genes identified by SGA screens . Volume 22 October 1 , 2011 Clc1 – Sla2 binding regulates endocytosis | 3703 ( i . e . , greater than expected for the size of the data set ) . Included was the clathrin - associated TGN / endosomal AP - 1 adaptor complex ( p < 0 . 01 ; Figure 1D ) . These negative genetic interactions are consistent with previous work combining clathrin and AP - 1 adaptor mutations ( Stepp et al . , 1995 ; Yeung et al . , 1999 ) . Negative genetic interac - tions were also observed with a number of other factors involved in retrograde transport from the endosome to the TGN ( Supplemental Table S2 ) , including most components of the retromer complex ( Fig - ure 1E ; p < 0 . 01 ) . We hypothesize that this exacerbated growth phe - notype was caused by impairment of two parallel retrograde path - ways from the endosome , one involving clathrin and another involving retromer . In addition , we identified several subunits of the GET complex , which is required for insertion of tail - anchored pro - teins into the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) ( Simpson et al . , 2010 ) ( Fig - ure 1F ; p < 0 . 01 ) . GET complex – requiring soluble N - ethylmaleim - ide – sensitive factor attachment protein receptors , such as SNC2 and VAM3 , were also identified , suggesting that GET complex inter - actions may just phenocopy the loss of these downstream targets . In accordance with the previously described clathrin synthetic lethality screen using a ts chc1 allele , chc1 - 521 ( Bensen et al . , 2000 , 2001 ) , we identified four mutants ( ric1 , gga1 , vps21 , and inp53 ) with synthetic growth defects in combination with clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 . We sus - pect that some of these negative genetic interactions with the clc1 mutant may be related to the reduced levels of Chc1 ; however , we cannot rule out that the CLC - NT has some TGN / endosomal – specific function . Genetic interactions involving mutations affecting other stages of the secretory / endosomal transport pathways and a num - ber of membrane transporters were identified ( Supplemental Table S2 ) . Others were observed with genes important for cell wall biosyn - thesis , glycosylation , lipid / sphingolipid and phosphatidyl inositide synthesis , and components affecting ubiquitin modification . The last - named observation is consistent with previous studies showing that clathrin - deficient yeast accumulate ubiquitinated conjugates and deplete cellular ubiquitin stores ( Nelson and Lemmon , 1993 ) . In addition to pan1 and arp3 found in the ts screen , a null allele of EDE1 , which encodes an EH - domain early endocytic adaptor , caused synthetic growth defects in combination with clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 ( Figure 1G ) . Most interesting was that clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 suppressed the growth defects of null mutations for three late - stage endocytic factors : Vrp1 ( verprolin , the type I myosin activator related to WIP ) and Rvs161 and Rvs167 ( amphiphysins involved in vesicle scission ; Figure 1G and Table 1 ) . These unusual positive genetic interactions seemed more likely to yield mechanistic insight into the role of the CLC - NT . Thus we focused primarily on vrp1 and rvs167 since their ε scores were high , but rvs161 gave similar , although more subtle ef - fects , as shown for rvs167 . The clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 allele suppresses growth and endocytic defects of vrp1 Δ and rvs167 Δ To ensure the validity of these genetic interactions , the clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 mutation was recapitulated in our SL1462 lab strain and crossed to either vrp1 Δ or rvs167 Δ . Whereas clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 yeast grew well at 30 or 37°C , vrp1 ( Figure 2A ) and rvs167 Δ ( Figure 2B ) cells were ts at 37°C . Consistent with the SGA screen , clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 suppressed the ts growth of vrp1 Δ ( Figure 2A ) and rvs167 Δ ( Figure 2B ) at 37°C . Ac - tin polarity defects are often associated with endocytic mutations . clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 cells were polarized like wild type , and the clc1 allele substantially suppressed the polarity defects caused by vrp1 Δ or rvs167 Δ as well ( Figure 2 , C and D ) . Lucifer yellow ( LY ) uptake assays were used to test bulk fluid - phase endocytosis ( Figure 2 , E and F ) . LY uptake in the clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 mutant was similar to wild type . As expected , both vrp1 Δ and rvs167 Δ yeast had minimal uptake , with only 5 – 8 % of cells with la - beled vacuoles . However , when combined with the clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 al - lele there was significant restoration of LY internalization compared with either null allele alone ( Figure 2 , E and F ) . Similarly the LY up - take defect in rvs161 Δ was suppressed by clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 ( Supplemen - tal Figure S1B ) . Because we saw no defect in growth at elevated temperature , polarity , or LY uptake in the clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 mutant alone , we conclude that this mutation suppresses the defects caused by the verprolin or amphiphysin gene deletions . clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 rescues vrp1 Δ defects in endocytic dynamics and inward vesicle movement Previous reports showed that verprolin arrives at the endocytic patch just prior to the actin phase , where it plays a role in the recruitment and activation of the potent Arp2 / 3 – activating type I myosins ( Myo3 and Myo5 ) , which are important for actin - dependent membrane in - vagination ( Anderson et al . , 1998 ; Evangelista et al . , 2000 ; Geli et al . , 2000 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ; Sun et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , inward movement of endocytic patches is defective in vrp1 Δ yeast because of reduced Myo3 / 5 at the patch and impaired activation of residual myosin present ( Sun et al . , 2006 ) . To visualize whether clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 suppressed the defects of vrp1 Δ , we combined these mutations with early endocytic markers ( either Sla2 – green fluorescent protein [ GFP ] or Sla1 - GFP ) and a mobile phase / actin marker ( Abp1 – red flu - orescent protein [ RFP ] ) , and collected time - lapse movies of their dynamics in live cells . Unlike growth defects , which were best ob - served at elevated temperatures , the endocytic defects of vrp1 Δ ( and rvs Δ ; see later discussion ) were highly penetrant , so movies were taken at 25°C . The clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 mutation alone caused no significant change in the lifetime of any endocytic marker we tested , and invagination was normal ( Figure 3 , A – C , and unpublished data ) . In contrast , vrp1 Δ yeast demonstrated dramatic lifetime elongation of both Sla1 - GFP and Sla2 - GFP ( Figure 3 , A – C ) . Sla1 - GFP lifetimes were prolonged from 31 ± 6 s in wild type to 69 ± 17 s in vrp1 Δ ( p < 0 . 0001 ; Figure 3 , A and C ) . Sla2 - GFP was more severely affected , with lifetimes extended from 49 ± 15 s in wild type to 165 ± 57 s in the verprolin mutant ( p ≤ 0 . 0001 ; Figure 3 , B and C ) . Combining clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 with vrp1 Δ significantly reduced the lifetimes of both Sla1 - GFP ( to 56 ± 14 s ; p ≤ 0 . 001 ) and Sla2 - GFP ( to 73 ± 25 s ; p ≤ 0 . 0001 ; Figure 3 , A – C ) . Of note , there was also an elongation of the actin stage of endocytosis in vrp1 Δ , as marked by Abp1 - RFP , but this was not sup - pressed by the clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 mutation . The invagination defect caused by vrp1 was also suppressed by clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 . In vrp1 Δ 80 % of Sla2 patches accumulated some de - gree of Abp1 - RFP ( Figure 3 , D – F ) , but only 20 % of these showed any movement inward from the cortex . This percentage increased to 47 % in vrp1 Δ clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 ( Figure 3 , D – E ) . This was also seen in sin - gle - particle tracking of movement of Sla2 - GFP , which normally in - vaginates 200 – 300 nm with the forming vesicle and disassembles shortly after vesicle scission . The depth of Sla2 - GFP inward move - ment was impeded in vrp1 Δ ( 65 ± 13 nm vs . 250 ± 20 nm in wild type , n = 10 ) , but this was restored to near wild - type distances ( 190 ± 43 nm , n = 10 ) in vrp1 Δ clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 ( Figure 3F ) . clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 rescues rvs167 Δ defects in endocytic dynamics Rvs161 and Rvs167 form a heterodimer through their N - terminal N - BAR domain and are recruited late to endocytic sites ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Friesen et al . , 2006 ) . These proteins require one another for stable expression , and deletion of either of these proteins causes endocytic defects ( Munn et al . , 1995 ; Lombardi and Riezman , 2001 ; Friesen et al . , 2006 ) .

By time - lapse imaging we found that Sla2 - GFP lifetimes were lengthened by twofold in rvs167 Δ , but the clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 allele restored Sla2 lifetimes to near wild type ( 99 ± 33 vs . 54 ± 21 s , p ≤ 0 . 0001 , rvs167 Δ vs . rvs167 Δ clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 , respectively ) ( Figure 4 , B and C ) .

Similar although more subtle results were ob - tained in rvs161 Δ yeast ( Supplemental Figure S1C ) . In addition , combining the clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 allele with either rvs167 Δ or rvs161 Δ increased the number of internalizing patches and re - duced the retraction of endocytic markers back to the cortex as compared with either rvs mutant alone ( Figure 4D and Supplemental Figure S1D ) . Neither vrp1 Δ nor rvs167 Δ is suppressed by clc1 Δ To test whether the suppression by clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 was unique to this clc1 allele and not due to general loss of CLC function or the slightly re - duced levels of clathrin HC , we tested the abil - ity of the null clc1 Δ to suppress vrp1 Δ or rvs167 Δ growth and endocytosis . In either case neither temperature sensitivity nor endocytic dynamics was rescued ( Figure 5 ) . The endo - cytic profiles seen in vrp1 Δ clc1 Δ yeast were more characteristic of a clathrin - null than a verprolin - null mutant ( Newpher and Lemmon , 2006 ) since nearly 77 % of Sla2 - GFP patches persisted longer than 360 s ( Figure 5B ) . Of in - terest , the characteristic actin comet tails caused by clc1 Δ were missing in vrp1 Δ clc1 Δ cells , probably due to impaired recruitment of the type I myosins in vrp1 and , as a conse - quence , reduced actin assembly . rvs167 Δ clc1 Δ cells also had severe endocytic defects ( Figure 5D ) . Again , 77 % of all Sla2 - GFP patches were arrested , and in these cells dramatic actin comet tails were evident in 23 % of patches . clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 suppression of vrp1 Δ and rvs167 Δ requires actin binding by Sla2 As shown earlier , deletion of the N - terminus of CLC suppressed the loss of Vrp1 and Rvs proteins , three components of the actin phase of internalization . Because CLC - N terminus binds directly to the Sla2 coiled - coil region and Sla2 binds directly to F - actin through its THATCH domain , we considered the possibil - ity that the clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 mutant effects were mediated through altered ability to regulate Sla2 actin binding . Therefore we examined the effect of CLC on Sla2 in vitro using F - actin FIguRE 3 : Defects in endocytic dynamics of vrp1 Δ are suppressed when combined with clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 .

Purified glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fu - sions of Sla2 ( Figure 6A ) were incubated with preassembled F - actin and pelleted at high speed ( Figure 6 , B and C , and Supplemental Figure S2 ) . All Sla2 fragments with the THATCH domain bound to F - actin . When the clathrin LC – binding site was present ( GST - Sla2 - 292 - 968 ) , preincubation with a 5 M excess of histidine ( His ) 6 - tagged - LC ( 6xHis - Clc1 ) reduced cosedimentation dramatically ( Figure 6B and Supplemental Figure S2D ) . Similar results were found for full - length GST - Sla2 ( Supplemental Figure S2 , A and D ) ; how - ever , in our hands GST - Sla2 was considerably less stable and less soluble than fragments lacking the ANTH domain ( unpublished data ) . In contrast , the THATCH domain alone ( GST - Sla2 - 717 - 968 ) , lacking the clathrin LC – binding region , bound actin even in the presence of 6xHis - Clc1 ( Figure 6C and Supplemental Figure S2D ) . GST - Crn1 ( coronin ) was tested as a positive control for F - actin bind - ing and was found to bind actin in the presence or absence of Clc1 ( Supplemental Figure S2D and unpublished data ) . Neither bovine serum albumin contained in the actin - binding buffer ( Supplemental Figure S2C ) nor GST ( unpublished data ) bound nonspecifically to F - actin . Overall these results indicate that CLC inhibits the ability of Sla2 to bind to actin . To determine whether clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 suppression of vrp1 Δ or rvs167 Δ in vivo was mediated through Sla2 , we tested whether the Sla2 C - terminal THATCH domain was required for this effect . A he - magglutinin ( HA ) tag was inserted at residue 717 of Sla2 , causing a C - terminal truncation . As a control , an HA tag was inserted after the full - length Sla2 coding sequence . Deletion of the THATCH region caused no phenotype ( unpublished data ) , as shown previously ( Wesp et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 1999 ) . However , although vrp1 Δ clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 or rvs167 Δ clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 cells could grow at 37°C , triple - mutant cells also containing the sla2 - Δ thatch allele were ts for growth ( Figure 6D ) . Collectively these data indicate that the sup - pression by clc1 Δ 19 - 76 depends on the interaction of Sla2 with F - actin through the Sla2 THATCH domain . clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 suppresses mutations in major actin nucleation – promoting factors At the endocytic patch F - actin is densely branched , requiring the Arp2 / 3 complex for assembly ( Goode and Rodal , 2001 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex has little activity on its own since it requires an actin nucle - ation – promoting factor ( NPF ) to seed actin assembly ( Goode et al . , 2001 ) . In yeast , five endocytic NPFs have been identified : Pan1 , Las17 , Myo3 , Myo5 , and Abp1 ( Winter et al . , 1999 ; Evangelista et al . , 2000 ; Lechler et al . , 2000 ; Duncan et al . , 2001 ; Goode et al . , 2001 ) , although Pan1 and Abp1 are considered weak NPFs com - pared with the strong activities of Las17 or the type I myosins ( Sun et al . , 2006 ) . The WASp homologue , Las17 , aids in recruitment of Vrp1 , which in turn recruits and activates the redundant type I myo - sins Myo3 and Myo5 ( Anderson et al . , 1998 ; Evangelista et al . , 2000 ; Geli et al . , 2000 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ; Sun et al . , 2006 ; Wong et al . , 2010 ) . Because verprolin binds these three potent NPFs , we tested whether clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 would suppress null mutations in these genes . The clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 mutation was crossed to a myo3 Δ myo5 Δ strain , and resultant segregants were tested for growth . myo3 Δ myo 5 Δ mutants showed extremely impaired growth at both 30 and 37°C , but combining the double null with clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 suppressed this de - fect ( Figure 7A ) . Again using time - lapse imaging , we examined Sla1 , Sla2 , and Abp1 for fluorescence lifetimes and movement ( Figure 7 , C , D , and G ) . In myo3 Δ myo5 Δ cells the lifetimes of Sla2 patches were extremely delayed compared with wild type , and only 8 % of patches internalized , consistent with previous work ( Sun et al . , 2006 ) . However , these phenotypes were rescued by combination with the FIguRE 4 : Defects in endocytic dynamics of rvs167 Δ are suppressed when combined with clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 .

Volume 22 October 1 , 2011 Clc1 – Sla2 binding regulates endocytosis | 3707 clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 allele . Sla2 - GFP lifetimes decreased from 226 ± 102 to 56 ± 36 s ( p ≤ 0 . 0001 , myo3 Δ myo5 Δ vs . myo3 Δ myo5 Δ clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 , respectively ; Figure 7 , D and G ) , and the percentage of internalizing patches rose to 58 % when clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 was present in the myosin mu - tant . We also saw a mild effect of clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 in myo3 Δ ( unpub - lished data ) or myo5 Δ alone ( Figure 7 , A and C – G ) , although gener - ally the single myosin mutants were only slightly defective on their own , which explains why they did not appear in the SGA screen . Deletion of LAS17 caused temperature - sensitive growth at 37°C , which was also suppressed by clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 ( Figure 7B ) . las17 Δ greatly increased both Sla1 - GFP ( 80 ± 38 s ) , as shown previously ( Sun et al . , 2006 ) , and Sla2 - GFP ( 124 ± 62 s ) lifetimes compared with wild type ( Figure 7 , E – G ) . When las17 Δ was combined with clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 the lifetime of Sla1 was restored to normal ( 33 ± 7 s , p ≤ 0 . 0001 vs . las17 Δ ) , and there was significant improvement of the lifetime of Sla2 ( 78 ± 36 s , p ≤ 0 . 0001 vs . las17 Δ ; Figure 7 , E – G ) . Of interest , clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 also suppressed the extended lifetime of Abp1 - RFP in las17 Δ or myo3 Δ myo5 Δ ( Figure 7 , C – G ) , which was not observed for vrp1 Δ and rvs167 Δ ( Figures 3C and 4C ) . Overall these results show that clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 also suppresses endocytic de - fects caused by loss of the major NPFs . DISCUSSION In this study we performed SGA with yeast containing a deletion of the Sla2 - binding region of CLC in order to elucidate the functional significance of this interaction in vivo . This unbiased approach iden - tified a large number of negative genetic interactions with clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 , including many with components involved in clathrin - mediated transport and TGN / endosomal trafficking . We focused on three endocytic factors , Vrp1 , Rvs167 , and Rvs161 , whose mutations were suppressed by clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 , as positive genetic interactions were likely to be specific to the clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 allele and provide infor - mation on the regulatory role of the CLC – Sla2 interaction . On the basis of our results , we propose the model shown in Figure 8 , where CLC – Sla2 interaction prevents Sla2 binding to F - actin . This CLC inhibition would thereby restrict the number of attachments between Sla2 and actin , possibly to an area near the neck or edge of the clathrin coat ( Figure 8A ) . Consistent with this , FIguRE 5 : vrp1 Δ and rvs167 Δ are not suppressed by a clathrin LC null ( clc1 Δ ) . ( A ) Wild type ( SL1462 ) , clc1 Δ ( SL1620 ) , vrp1 Δ ( SL4136 ) , and vrp1 Δ clc1 Δ ( SL6290 ) were fivefold serially diluted , plated on YEPD , and grown at 30 or 37°C for 60 h .

Molecular Biology of the Cell immuno – electron microscopy ( immuno - EM ) of unroofed cells showed Hip1R associated with actin filaments primarily at the edge of clathrin lattices and pits ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2001 ) . In yeast Sla2 – actin attachments at the edge of the pit may pro - vide directionality to the force produced by actin assembly or even assist in vesicle scission . CLC is likely to achieve this regula - tion by causing conformational changes of Sla2 that regulate THATCH accessibility to actin . Self - interaction of the THATCH and coiled - coil regions of Sla2 were first suggested by two - hybrid analysis ( Yang et al . , 1999 ) . Electron microscopy of purified Hip1R or Hip1 showed the existence of both compact and extended profiles of the proteins ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2001 ; Wilbur et al . , 2008 ) , but the more compact structures are more prevalent in the presence of a 22 – amino acid clathrin LCa N - terminal pep - tide containing the CLC - Hip1 / R binding site ( Wilbur et al . , 2008 ) . Moreover , in surface plasmon resonance analysis the CLC NT peptide decreased the affinity of Hip1 or Hip1R binding to F - actin , suggesting that CLC binding in vitro negatively regulates Hip1 / R attachments to actin by promoting Hip1 / R self - interaction ( Wilbur et al . , 2008 ) . Our work provides the first in vivo studies to support this regula - tory model by showing that clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 , a clc1 mutant lacking its Sla2 interaction domain , can overcome several mutations leading to reduced late - stage actin assembly ( vrp1 Δ , myo3 Δ myo5 Δ , las17 Δ ) or failure to adequately narrow the neck of a vesicle ( rvs167 Δ / rvs161 Δ ) . Recent studies suggested that CLC - NT prevents bending of the CHC knee , which impairs clathrin assembly ( Wilbur et al . , 2010 ) . Thus , deletion of the CLC - NT in our studies could be more favor - able for formation of a curved lattice and promote membrane defor - mation . However , clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 suppression of vrp1 Δ and rvs167 Δ depended on the actin - binding THATCH region of Sla2 , which is more consistent with a mechanism of suppression involving Sla2 in - teraction with the actin cytoskeleton . Immuno - EM analysis showed that the N - BAR proteins Rvs161 and Rvs167 are situated along the tubular invagination above the clathrin coat . This is consistent with their association with the nar - rowing neck of the invaginating vesicle and function in constriction of the membrane , leading to vesicle scission ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Idrissi et al . , 2008 ) . New studies suggest that the amphiphysins may work in concert with the yeast dynamin Vps1 , although the endocytic defects of vps1 mutants are much less severe and went unnoticed for some time ( Nannapaneni et al . , 2010 ; Smaczynska - de et al . , 2010 ; our unpub - lished data ) . Although actin assembly would be robust in the amphiphysin mutants , the lack of constriction on the neck would im - pair scission , which is observed as retraction events by live - cell imaging ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Smaczynska - de et al . , 2010 ; Youn et al . , 2010 ; Figure 8B ) . At the end of retrac - tion , usually the coats and actin dissipate . We suggest that increased binding to actin by Sla2 allowed by the clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 muta - tion might overcome this by stabilizing the coat and actin network ( Figure 8D ) . This could drive the invaginations deeper into the cell , thus narrowing the neck of the in - vagination , or the new attachments could promote scission directly . Supporting this , in some cases we observed multiple retraction events and then internalization , as if the stabilization of the patch allowed added coat and actin assembly and new attempts at vesicle scission ( D . R . B . , unpublished observations ) . The role of verprolin is to recruit and activate the type I myosins and is thus critical for the actin assembly burst that drives invagina - tion ( Anderson et al . , 1998 ; Geli et al . , 2000 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ; Sun et al . , 2006 ) . In yeast lacking Vrp1 ( or myosin I function ) , there is no obvious inward movement of the endocytic coat ( Figure 8C ) , despite the fact that the actin marker Abp1 is recruited ( Sun et al . , 2006 ) . Residual actin assembly is likely provided by other endocytic NPFs , including Las17 ( WASp ) ; however , these may not be sufficient or properly positioned to drive invagination when the myosin function is impaired . We suggest that this defect is overcome by clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 since it would increase the duration of Sla2 binding to actin , as well as affect the location and number of attachments ( Figure 8E ) . In ad - dition , this may stabilize the actin network to overcome the reduced NPF activity caused by vrp1 Δ ’s effects on Myo3 / 5 activity . Because clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 could suppress vrp1 Δ , one might predict that the clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 allele could suppress other NPF mutations . Abp1 is a weak NPF , and abp1 Δ has no phenotype on its own , so we did not expect to see suppression by the clc1 mutation . However , our genetic screens found that clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 exacerbated the growth defect of pan1 - 4 ( discussed later ) . We directly examined the three most potent NPF activities at the endocytic patch , Las17 , and type I myosins ( Winter et al . , 1999 ; Evangelista et al . , 2000 ; Lechler et al . , 2000 ; Duncan et al . , 2001 ; Goode et al . , 2001 ) , which were not iden - tified in the SGA screen . We found that clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 also suppressed the growth and endocytic defects of l as17 Δ and myo3 Δ myo5 Δ . Thus the model for verprolin ( Figure 8 ) applies to these NPFs as well . Al - though las17 Δ was not tested , three las17 ts alleles were analyzed by SGA , but their phenotypes may have been either too weak or too severe to observe suppression in a large - scale screen . Redundancy of the type - I myosins likely prevented their identification in the SGA . We note that there was a difference in the suppression of vrp1 Δ as compared with las17 Δ or myo3 Δ myo5 Δ , in that clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 sup - pressed the slowed Abp1 lifetime of these NPF mutations but not that of vrp1 Δ . The reason for this distinction is not clear . Because Vrp1 binds both Las17 and the myosins , we suggest that Vrp1 also FIguRE 6 : Clathrin LC inhibits Sla2 binding to F - actin .

Volume 22 October 1 , 2011 Clc1 – Sla2 binding regulates endocytosis | 3709 regulates the activity of the WASp . Thus in vrp1 Δ the stimulatory activity of each of the major NPFs might be impaired , extending the time needed to produce a competent F - actin network for internalization . In las17 Δ or myo3 Δ myo5 Δ , at least one of the major NPFs would still be active . PAN1 is one of the few essential endo - cytic genes . It encodes a scaffolding coat factor that binds several other endocytic coat proteins . Pan1 arrives at endocytic patches ∼20 – 30 s before the actin phase and has weak NPF activity ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Sun et al . , 2006 ; Huang and Cai , 2007 ) . In addition , the central domain of Sla2 ( including the coiled - coil region ) binds Pan1 and negatively regulates Pan1 NPF ac - tivity in vitro . Because the pan1 - 4 product lacks its NPF activation domain ( Li et al . , 2011 ) , we initially surmised that the genetic interaction with clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 might be due to Pan1’s importance in priming actin as - sembly at the coat to initiate curvature . We tested this using pan1 - 20 , which results in a truncation downstream of the NPF actin ac - tivation region but deletes the C - terminal proline - rich domain ( PRD ; Barker et al . , 2007 ) . This mutant also caused synthetic le - thality with clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 , consistent with the pan1 - 4 SGA results . These data suggest that the CLC - NT shares redundancy with functions of the Pan1 - PRD , which may include the role of PRDs in binding to SH3 - domain proteins ( Barker et al . , 2007 ) . However , we also cannot rule out that one role of CLC - NT binding to Sla2 may be to release Sla2’s reported negative regulation of Pan1 NPF activity ( Toshima et al . , 2007 ) . The loss of CLC – Sla2 interaction might lead to prolonged Sla2 inhibition , which in the context of an impaired Pan1 could be FIguRE 7 : Endocytic defects caused by elimination of the type I myosins ( myo3 Δ myo5 Δ ) or WASp ( las17 Δ ) are suppressed by clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 .

R . Boettner et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell severely detrimental . Further studies are needed to uncover the ba - sis for this synthetic lethality . In mammals , Hip1R binds F - actin barbed ends in association with cortactin , which inhibits actin filament depolymerization in vitro ( Le Clainche et al . , 2007 ) . This was suggested to channel new actin assembly and to stabilize F - actin . Despite a lack of a cortactin homo - logue in yeast , suppression by clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 may involve a broader distribution of anchoring surrounding the invagination and increased stability of the network by barbed end binding . We note that cap - ping protein also binds to barbed ends and terminates filament elongation , but Sla2 is unique in that its ANTH region would also serve to tether the membrane to actin . In fact , complete absence of Sla2 leads to impaired invagination and unproductive actin comet tails emanating from the cell surface ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , localized Sla2 contact with F - actin performs a unique function in di - recting elongation of the membrane protrusions and / or scission . The invaginating sites in yeast have an extended tubular mor - phology with a clathrin coat at the tip and actin assembled sur - rounding the tubule ( Idrissi et al . , 2008 ) . This architecture of such tubular assemblies with associated actin and clathrin has also been observed in mammalian cells . For example , internalizing vesicular stomatitis virus was found in deep invagination profiles with a clath - rin cap at its base and an extensive actin network along the mem - brane surrounding the virus extending up to the cell surface , sug - gesting that actin is required for clathrin - mediated endocytosis of large particles ( Cureton et al . , 2009 ) . In addition , long actin - depen - dent tubules with clathrin pits at the tip are generated in dynamin 1 and 2 double - knockout cells ( Ferguson et al . , 2009 ) . These endo - cytic structures have been recapitulated in vitro from plasma mem - brane sheets incubated in the presence of cytosol and GTP γ S , which blocks scission ( Wu et al . , 2010 ) .

To perform net - work analysis , each screen hit was used as a node , and additional node / edge attributes ( from the Saccharomyces Genome Database ) were layered onto the data set using Cytoscape ( Kohl et al . , 2010 ) . Known physical interactions were used to identify protein complexes ( Figures 1 , D – G ) using the MCODE plug - in for Cytoscape ( Bader and Hogue , 2003 ) . Microscopy and image analysis Live - cell imaging of endocytosis was carried out essentially as de - scribed in Boettner et al . ( 2009 ) . Cells were grown to log phase at 25°C in synthetic medium , concentrated , immobilized on polylysine - coated coverslips , mounted on slides in 1 . 6 % agarose , and then imaged at 25°C . All fluorescence lifetimes were calculated from movies acquired on an Olympus ( Center Valley , PA ) BX71 inverted microscope equipped with differential interference contrast ( DIC ) optics , an UPlan Apo 150 × total internal reflection fluorescence ob - jective ( numerical aperture [ NA ] , 1 . 45 ) , Hamamatsu ( Hamamatsu , Japan ) ImagEM C910013 512 × 512 bit EM charge - coupled device camera , and a Sutter Instrument ( Novato , CA ) Lambda DG4 rapid wavelength switcher with a 300 - W xenon lamp . Images were cap - tured using SlideBook 4 . 2 for PC platform ( Intelligent Imaging In - novations , Denver , CO ) . Following capture , all movies were photo - bleach corrected in SlideBook using the exponential correction function . Average patch lifetimes and standard deviations were de - termined from 30 – 40 patches for each strain . Student’s t test was used to calculate p values . All kymographs , projection images , and example micrographs were generated in SlideBook and then ex - ported to Adobe Photoshop ( San Jose , CA ) for figure assembly . Single - particle tracks were generated from movies exported from SlideBook into ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) using the plug - in ParticleTracker ( Sbalzarini and Koumoutsakos , 2005 ) . Particle trajectories that aligned 90 deg from the cell cortex were converted from pixel to metric distances and graphed using SigmaPlot . All other microscopy was carried out on an Olympus fluores - cence BX61 upright microscope equipped with Nomarski DIC op - tics , a UPlan S Apo 100 × objective ( NA 1 . 4 ) , a CoolSnap HQ camera ( Roper Scientific Germany , Ottobrunn , Germany ) , Sutter Instrument Lambda 10 - 2 excitation and emission filter wheels , and a 175 - W xenon remote source with liquid light guide . Image capture was au - tomated using SlideBook 4 . 01 for the Mac . Analysis of actin polarization in phalloidin stained cells was done as follows . Cells were grown in YEPD to a concentration of 5 × 10 6 cells / ml at 30°C . Formaldehyde was added directly to growth me - dium to a final concentration of 4 % , and cultures were continued for similarities with yeast tubular invaginations , suggesting a role for Hip1 and Hip1R in their formation . In summary , we believe that our results support the idea that a major role of CLC is to control endocytic progression by pruning the Sla2 – actin attachments in the endocytic coat so that anchoring is restricted , possibly to the edge or neck of the invaginating vesicle . Releasing attachments in the coat could contribute to development of the endocytic vesicle and may be needed to promote directional membrane internalization . Restricting attachments to near the neck might also promote vesicle scission . MATERIALS AND METHODS Yeast strains and growth assays Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Sup - plemental Table S1A . Standard methods and media were used for genetic manipulations , growth , and transformation of yeast ( Guthrie and Fink , 1991 ) . To perform growth - plating assays , overnight log - phase liquid cultures were diluted to a starting concentration of 5 × 10 6 cells / ml and then fivefold serially diluted in 96 - well plates . Di - luted cells were pinned with a multiprong frog onto yeast extract / peptone / dextrose ( YEPD ) plates and grown at indicated tempera - tures for 48 – 60 h . Generation of the integrated clathrin light - chain allele ( clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 : NatMX6 ) was done as follows . First a HisMX6 PCR fragment , flanked by Nco 1 sites with CLC1 ends to excise codons 19 – 76 , was cotransformed into yeast with pRS424 containing CLC1 . Recombi - nant plasmids were shuttled into bacteria from Trp + His + colonies , cut with Nco 1 , and ligated to excise the HisMX6 , yielding pTM45 with the clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 allele . Note that the religation changed codon 19 from GAC ( Asp ) to GAA ( Glu ) and inserted two codons repre - senting the Nco I site : CCA ( Pro ) and TGG ( Trp ) . Next the NatMX6 marker was PCR amplified from a pFA6a - NatMX6 template and in - tegrated via homologous recombination downstream of the clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 coding sequence in pTM45 . The resultant plasmid ( pDRB1 ) was used as a template for two PCR amplifications . The first contained the 5 ′ flanking CLC1 DNA , the mutant allele , and 500 nucleotides of the NatMX6 marker . The second contained the full NatMX6 marker followed by 3 ′ sequence flanking CLC1 . These products were cotransformed into the SGA tester strain y7092 ( Tong et al . , 2007 ) , as well as our laboratory wild - type strain ( SL1462 ) for split marker recombination ( Catlett et al . , 2003 ) , and screened for simultaneous recombination at the CLC1 locus , generating SL5677 and SL6044 , respectively . The integrated mutant alleles were recov - ered by PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing . The integrated SLA2 - GFP : TRP1 was generated by homologous recombination as previously described ( Wach et al . , 1997 ; Longtine et al . , 1998 ) , using pFA6a - TRP1 as a template . Similarly , SLA2 - HA : HisMX6 and SLA2 - Δ THATCH - HA : HisMX6 were generated using pFA6a - 3HA - HisMX6 as the template . The coding sequence for the HA tag in SLA2 - Δ THATCH - HA : HisMX6 was integrated after SLA2 codon 716 . Strains for endocytic factor lifetimes and phenotypic analyses were created by standard genetic crosses . To avoid prob - lems of polyploidy found in clathrin - null strains , haploid clc1 Δ : HIS3 spores that segregated from tetrads with pKH2 ( CLC1 , 2 μ , URA3 ) ( Huang et al . , 1997 ) were used in crosses . Diploids were selected , grown on 5 - fluoroorotic acid to drop the CLC1 plasmid , and then sporulated and dissected . SgA screens SGA screens were conducted as described ( Tong and Boone , 2006 ) . In one screen the clc1 - Δ 19 - 76 : NatMX6 query strain ( SL5677 ) was crossed to a miniarray consisting of 177 strains with ts mutations in 3712 | D . R . Boettner et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell moved and the pellet was resuspended in water . The supernatant and pellet were brought to equal volumes in SDS – PAGE loading buffer , boiled for 3 min , and separated by SDS – PAGE on 8 – 20 % gradient polyacrylamide gels ( Invitrogen ) . Gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue , and high - resolution images were captured for densitometry analysis using ImageJ . Trapping of soluble proteins was accounted for by sedimentation of bovine serum albumin ( 2 μM ) in the presence of 10 μM F - actin . For immunoblots of clathrin LC and HC , cultures were grown to log phase ( 5 × 10 6 cells / ml ) at 30°C , and 10 ml were concentrated and subjected to glass bead lysis in 250 μl of 0 . 1 M Tris , pH 7 . 5 , containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a protease in - hibitor cocktail ( Stepp et al . , 1995 ) . Lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 10 , 000 × g , and equivalent volumes of the supernatants were analyzed by SDS – PAGE and immunoblotted using anti - Chc1 mouse monoclonal antibodies ( Lemmon et al . , 1988 ) , anti - Clc1 rab - bit polyclonal antiserum ( a gift from Greg Payne ) , or anti - PGK1 mouse monoclonal antibodies ( Molecular Probes ) as a loading con - trol . Antibody decoration was detected by an Odyssey Infrared Im - aging System ( LiCor , Lincoln , NE ) using IRDye700 - or IRDye800 - conjugated secondary antiserum ( LiCor ) . 10 min . Cells were collected and resuspended in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ; 140 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 8 mM KH 2 PO 4 ) containing 4 % formaldehyde and incubated at room temperature for an additional 1 h . After two washes in PBS , cells were stained overnight at 4°C with 6 . 6 μM Alexa 568 – phalloi - din ( Molecular Probes , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . Cells were washed five times in PBS and immobilized on polylysine - coated coverslips for imaging . A series of optical Z - sections ( 0 . 2 μm ) ware captured and then deconvolved by the nearest - neighbor algorithm and pro - jected into a single plane using SlideBook . Polarization of actin was quantified on cells with small or medium - size buds as described by Bi et al . ( 1998 ) . Total fluorescence measurements were made for the whole cell and the mother cell in SlideBook . Cells with more than 50 % of the total fluorescence in the mother cell were scored as non - polarized ( n = 50 ) . Lucifer yellow ( Molecular Probes ) uptake was performed at 30°C for 1 h as described in Dulic et al . ( 1991 ) . Biochemical methods Bacterial expression plasmids for GST - Sla2 ( pTMN5 ) , GST - Sla2 - ( 292 - 968 ) , and 6xHis - Clc1 ( pTMN3 ) are described in Newpher and Lemmon ( 2006 ) . GST - Crn1 was expressed in bacteria from pGAT2 - CRN ( 1 – 651 ) ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) . The vector for expression of GST - Sla2 - ( 717 - 968 ) ( pDRB7 ) was generated by ligation of a SLA2 PCR fragment encoding amino acids 717 – 968 ( THATCH domain ) with Bam H1 / Sal 1 ends into pGEX - 4t . GST fusions were expressed in Rosetta Escherichia coli ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA ) . Cultures were grown to log phase at 37°C , then induced with 0 . 5 mM isopropyl - β - d - thiogalactoside for 6 h at 25°C . After pelleting , cells were resuspended in lysis buffer ( 140 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 8 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 3 ) containing 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ( v / v ) , 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Stepp et al . , 1995 ) , and lysozyme ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ) and incubated on ice for 15 min . Cells were lysed by sonication , and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 16 , 000 × g for 20 min . GST fusions were absorbed from the cleared superna - tant onto glutathione – agarose beads ( GE Healthcare , Piscataway , NJ ) for 1 . 5 h on a rocker at 4°C . Beads were loaded into a poly - prep chromatography column ( 0 . 8 × 4 cm ; Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) and washed in 10 column volumes of lysis buffer , and then GST fusions were eluted in 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 10 mM reduced glutathione , and 1 mM DTT . Peak fractions were exchanged into actin assembly buffer ( see later discussion ) , concentrated in a Centricon - 10 size ex - clusion filter ( Millipore , Billerica , MA ) , brought up to 10 % glycerol , snap frozen , and stored at −80°C . The 6xHis - Clc1 ( pTMN3 ) was ex - pressed and purified from BL - 21 E . coli ( DE3 ) as described in Newpher and Lemmon ( 2006 ) . Actin cosedimentation assays were performed as described by Gohla et al . ( 2005 ) . Prior to use , all protein samples proteins were precleared by centrifugation at 100 , 000 × g in a Beckman Airfuge equipped with an A - 100 rotor . Nonmuscle actin ( Cytoskeleton , Denver , CO ) was assembled for 1 h at room temperature in actin assembly buffer ( 4 . 5 mM Tris - HCl , 20 μM CaCl 2 , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP , pH 8 . 0 ) . Assembled F - actin was added at a final concentration of 10 μM to either input proteins alone or input pro - teins preincubated for 1 h with a fivefold molar excess of 6xHis - Clc1 . Input proteins were tested at the following concentrations : 3 μM GST - Sla2 - 292 - 958 , 3 μM GST - Sla2 - 717 - 968 , 1 μM GST - Sla2 , and 1 μM GST - Crn1 . Binding reactions were performed at 25°C for 1 h ( typically in 50 μl ) in actin assembly buffer , and then actin and actin - associated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation in the Airfuge at 100 , 000 × g for 1 h at room temperature .
