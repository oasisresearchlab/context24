Teaching designers to do this effectively is challenging because they tend to fixate on obvious problems and solutions [ 20 , 27 , 41 ] . However , even when a good solution is identified , designers need to consider and address the unanticipated consequences such as sub - problems that emerge when solutions are implemented [ 9 , 36 ] . This recursive process of framing a problem , developing a solution , and identify - ing new potential problems is difficult due to the lack of effective methods to support designers , especially non - experts [ 9 , 36 ] . Expert designers currently rely on design methods and design representations to explore and understand the design space more holistically [ 5 , 8 , 19 , 25 , 29 – 31 ] . These representations often take the form of a table with design decisions and corresponding options for each decision , which help designers to consider more options but does not encourage them to reflect on the consequences of their decisions [ 8 , 29 , 31 ] . Other representations , such as Fishbone Dia - grams [ 19 ] and Causal Diagrams [ 2 , 4 , 34 ] , help designers explore the consequences of their design decisions . While these representa - tions provide designers a method and procedure for systematically broadening their thinking , these static representations are cogni - tively demanding to construct [ 18 , 31 ] and do not offer suggestions when designers get fixated . Recent advances in Large Language Models ( LLMs ) trained on a massive corpus of human - generated text have shown the capability of generating diverse and personalized content , such as creative writing inspiration [ 13 , 42 ] and code snippets [ 10 , 22 ] . Recent work has explored methods for improving the performance of LLMs and making them easier to use [ 21 , 40 ] . However , it is still unclear how to guide these models to produce high - quality responses and how to mitigate potential bias in the generated responses . In this paper , we integrate an LLM into a mixed - initiative interface to leverage the generative creativity of LLMs while mitigating potential biases . We introduce a novel mixed - initiative system , CausalMapper , that leverages a LLM for inspiration and a design representation to help designers systematically broaden their understanding of a de - sign situation . Users can recursively connect problems to solutions to iteratively expand a design space . When they get stuck , they can ask GPT - 3 for suggestions . Users can accept , reject , or modify these suggestions based on their design goal . We demonstrate how causal maps can be used in a system intended to guide designers and LLMs to collaboratively construct and explore a design space . We contribute the CausalMapper system : a mixed - initiative intelligent user interface that leverages LLMs and shared causal representation to guide exploration and learning about systems thinking . 2 THE CAUSALMAPPER SYSTEM CausalMapper , shown in Figure 1 , is a system that provides in - spiration and structural guidance to help designers construct and explore a complex design space . The design space is represented as a causal map , which includes causal chains of problems and solu - tions . CausalMapper is implemented as a graph - based web interface using vis . js with suggestions provided by GPT - 3 . Each node in the graph represents a goal , problem , or solution . Each edge represents a causal relationship between two nodes . When a node is selected , CausalMapper offers the following features for user interaction : • Suggest Nodes prompts GPT - 3 to suggest causally related problems or solutions of the selected node that users can add to the graph . • Add a Node manually add a child node to the selected node ( alternating between problems and solutions ) . • Edit a Node modify the content of the selected node . • Delete Node remove a selected node . • Create Edge create an connection between two nodes . Designers can use these features to systematically expand and explore a design space by recursively chaining problems and solu - tions together . Figure 2 demonstrates one example work flow when using CausalMapper . Designers can manually add new nodes or be inspired by the suggestions from GPT - 3 . Designers can also de - cide whether to accept , reject , or edit the suggestions to refine and curate their design space . This approach leverages the generative creativity of LLMs and the domain expertise of designers , while grounding their mixed - initiative collaboration in a shared causal map representation . 2 . 1 LLMs generate inspirations to explore the design space Creativity support tools , such as design galleries [ 15 , 23 , 24 , 33 ] and design by analogy systems [ 16 , 35 , 39 ] , can inspire designers to consider points in the design space that are near or far from their current design exploration [ 12 ] . However , these systems often rely on a large corpus of pre - generated ideas which may not exist for every design context [ 15 , 16 , 23 , 24 , 33 , 35 , 39 ] . Recent advances in natural language processing , specifically large language models ( LLMs ) , have demonstrated the potential for generating human - like text in response to a custom prompt . Through prompt engineering [ 37 ] , our team has developed zero - shot prompts for LLMs to produce relevant and creative problems and solutions . Where previous work has shown the idea of chaining sub - prompts to better perform complex tasks [ 40 ] , we build on this idea by recursively chaining interactions to guide designers and LLMs in the process of constructing and exploring a design space . When using CausalMapper , designers can request suggestions from GPT - 3 which responds with 8 candidate suggestions to expand the given node . For example , if the node is a solution , GPT - 3 would generate 8 problems and the designer would reflect on and accept the most relevant problems . This iterative process of collaborative exploration between LLMs and designers may lead designers to uncover novel and valuable parts of a design space and encourage a deeper engagement with potential design pitfalls . 326 CausalMapper C & C ’23 , June 19 – 21 , 2023 , Virtual Event , USA Figure 2 : An example workflow of CausalMapper : 1 ) the designer sets an initial goal for their design exploration . 2 ) GPT - 3 suggests relevant solutions to achieve the goal , 3 ) the designer accepts 3 of the suggestions and edits one of them , 4 ) GPT - 3 suggests potential pitfalls associated with enacting one of the solutions , 5 ) the designer accepts 3 of the suggestions 2 . 2 Designers guide the exploration and evaluate suggestions from a human perspective Given a well - designed prompt , LLMs can generate high - quality and diverse responses [ 37 ] which might help designers think more broadly and avoid fixation . However , researchers have also raised concerns about the truthiness of responses [ 3 ] and have identified problematic biases [ 1 , 28 ] . This symbiotic partnership enables LLMs to stretch a designer’s creative potential and for designers to criti - cally evaluate , refine , and direct the suggestions provided by LLMs from a human perspective . To facilitate this process , CausalMapper provides three interac - tion techniques to curate the shared representation demonstrated in Figure 2 : 1 ) filter GPT - 3 suggestions , 2 ) edit a node , and 3 ) add a node . After GPT - 3 makes suggestions , the designer can evaluate and accept relevant suggestions to add them to the graph . Designers can also edit to refine the node to improve the quality of subsequent expansion suggestions from GPT - 3 . Lastly , designers can manually add problems or solutions that have not been suggested by GPT - 3 . In these ways , designers guide the collaborative exploration process to best support their design goals . 2 . 3 Causal Map as a shared representation to guide mixed - initiative exploration Mixed initiative interfaces enable users and intelligent agents to work collaboratively , guided by a shared representation [ 17 ] . These shared representations can be authored and edited by people and algorithms to collaboratively “contribute to , and adaptively learn from solutions to shared problems” [ 14 ] . Our work takes inspiration from mixed - initiative systems while also embracing prior research in design that indicates how a designer’s understanding of problems and solutions co - evolves through design activity [ 7 , 32 ] . We codify this theory as a causal map that alternates between problems , their solutions , and resulting problems that might arise when implement - ing the solution . These causal chains of problems and solutions are intended to systematically guide designers and LLMs to consider the consequences of their design decisions during mixed - initiative exploration of a design space . 3 CASE STUDY Figure 3 : The final design space curated by P7 with CausalMapper in 10 minutes . P7 added a total of 19 con - cepts : 15 are added from suggestions ( labeled with a light bulb ) and 4 are manually added ( labeled with a black border ) . The number at the end of each node represents the order that they are being added . To demonstrate the functionality of CausalMapper , we present one case study from a recent user study ( n = 21 ) . The goal of this single - case study is not to evaluate the CausalMapper system , but rather to demonstrate its functionality with a real example . The original study counterbalanced both versions of the application and two design tasks to facilitate direct comparisons ( i . e . : factorial design study ) . The baseline condition provided all the same affor - dances except it 1 ) did not provide the ‘suggest’ feature and 2 ) did not strictly enforce the causal map representation . In this single - case study , we show the design activity for P7 as they used CausalMapper . This participant used Baseline first , then used the CausalMapper version . In the CausalMapper version , P7 was given the design task of “reducing dependencies on fossil fuels” with a time limit of 10 minutes . As shown in Figure 3 , P7 added a total of 4 solutions manually and 15 problems from the Suggest function . P7 used the suggestions as an intelligent sparing partner that consistently pointed out potential pitfalls for their solutions . “My final set of solutions were alright since I came up with them myself but my final set of problems were fantastic the bot that came up with these problems did 327 C & C ’23 , June 19 – 21 , 2023 , Virtual Event , USA Huang et al . a good job finding such problems that even I could’ve never thought about” ( P7 ) P7’s log data reveals that each time P7 came up with a solution to the design goal , P7 leveraged suggestions from CausalMapper to challenge their own solution with 4 to 5 potential pitfalls . “The suggestions were useful to me 100 % of the time simply because they challenged my ideas . I love it . . . [ this ] tool can challenge my ideas with intellectual counters to my said ideas” ( P7 ) More analysis and studies are needed to further understand the benefits , limitations , and dynamics of CausalMapper in helping designers break out of fixation and think in systems . 4 DISCUSSION In this paper , we introduced CausalMapper , a creativity support tool , that focuses on teaching design students to critically examine the consequences of their design solutions . The tool is intended to help designers and large language models ( LLMs ) to collabora - tively explore a design space while benefiting from each other’s strengths by leveraging the generative creativity of LLMs to ex - pand a designer’s thinking process while leveraging the designer’s perspective to account for the variability in quality , relevance , and bias in the LLM - generated suggestions . Previous works have demonstrated that non - experts face dif - ficulties thinking in systems such as fixating on surface - level de - tails [ 6 , 26 ] , overly focusing on solutions [ 11 ] , or failing to anticipate the consequences of their design activity [ 9 , 36 ] . We envision that CausalMapper might help design students develop an appreciation for reflecting more critically and holistically on the consequences of their intended solutions . By better understanding the causal chains associated with design intervention , designers might be able to bet - ter scope their design process to focus on a more specific part of the design space or to develop a comprehensive ecosystem of solutions that addresses the core problem and the resulting sub - problems . As future work , we will present a comprehensive evaluation of the CausalMapper system with design students to better understand how it affects their thinking process and values as a designer . We are especially interested in exploring different roles that students and AI might take . For example , the LLM could be used to come up with problems for each solution that a student ideates . Alternatively , the student could be tasked with brainstorming the potential pitfalls of solutions generated by the model . REFERENCES [ 1 ] Abubakar Abid , Maheen Farooqi , and James Zou . 2021 .
