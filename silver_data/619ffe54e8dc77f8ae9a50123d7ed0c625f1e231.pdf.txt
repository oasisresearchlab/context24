However , the neural mechanisms underlying dispositional insight are largely unknown . In the present study , we recruited forty - four young , healthy adults and performed several analyses to reveal the neural mechanisms of dispositional insight . Firstly , a voxel - based morphometry ( VBM ) technique was used to explore the structural brain mechanisms of dispositional insight . We found that dispositional insight was signiﬁcantly and negatively correlated with the regional gray matter volume ( rGMV ) in the left thalamus ( TLM . L ) , right temporoparietal junction ( TPJ . R ) , and left dorsal medial prefrontal cortex ( DMPFC . L ) . Secondly , we performed a seed - based resting - state functional connectivity ( RSFC ) analysis to complement the ﬁndings of VBM analysis further . The brain regions of TLM . L , DMPFC . L , and TPJ . R were selected as seed regions . We found that dispositional insight was associated with altered RSFC between the DMPFC . L and bilateral TPJ , between the TPJ . R and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex , DMPFC . L , TPJ . L , right insula , and right cerebellum . Finally , a mediation analysis found that the personality of neuroticism partially mediated the relationship between the brain region of TLM . L and dispositional insight . These ﬁndings imply that dispositional insight has a speciﬁc functional and structural neural mechanism . The personality of neuroticism may play a pivotal role in the processes of dispositional insight . Keywords : dispositional insight , structural brain mechanism , voxel - based morphometry , functional connectivity , mediation analysis INTRODUCTION Creativity is the primary human function to produce work and thoughts that are both original and valuable ( Sternberg and Lubart , 1996 ; Beaty et al . , 2018 ; Ren et al . , 2020 ; Tang et al . , 2022 ) . The importance of creativity has long been demonstrated ( Ren et al . , 2020 ) . Insight , a form of creativity , is a sudden comprehension that reinterprets a situation and solves a problem ( Bowden and Jung - Beeman , 2003 ; Webb et al . , 2016 ; Tik et al . , 2018 ; Lin et al . , 2020 ) . Studies of insight properties Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 1 April 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 846377 fnbeh - 16 - 846377 April 9 , 2022 Time : 15 : 7 # 2 Lin et al . Brain Structures Underlying Dispositional Insight usually focus on two dimensions : cognitive process and individual characteristics ( Ash and Wiley , 2006 ; Ovington et al . , 2016 ; Ogawa et al . , 2018 ) . Previous studies , treating insight as a problem’s solution process , used specialized tasks to induce insight and reveal the cognitive mechanisms under insightful solutions ( Metcalfe and Wiebe , 1987 ; Knoblich et al . , 1999 ; Kounios and Beeman , 2009 ) . Overall , these studies measured episodic ( state ) insight . Alternatively , other studies treated insight as an individual characteristic and found reliable individual diﬀerences in solving insight problems ( Jacobs and Dominowski , 1981 ; Ash and Wiley , 2006 ; Gilhooly and Fioratou , 2009 ; DeCaro and Wieth , 2016 ) . For instance , a study found stable individual diﬀerences in performance across diﬀerent object - use insight problems ( Jacobs and Dominowski , 1981 ) . Brieﬂy , these studies measured dispositional ( trait ) insight . Studying dispositional insight can explain why some people have more insightful problem - solving success than others . Recently , many studies have utilized various paradigms , such as riddles solving , to investigate the neural mechanisms of episodic insight ( Jung - Beeman et al . , 2004 ; Zhao et al . , 2014 ; Tik et al . , 2018 ; Lin et al . , 2020 ) . However , the neural mechanisms of dispositional insight are rarely understood . In the current study , we utilized voxel - based morphometry ( VBM ) method to explore the structural neural mechanisms of dispositional insight . Psychologically , episodic insight contains mental processes of set - shifting , reorienting attention , method - searching , emotional experience , and establishing new representations ( Jung - Beeman et al . , 2004 ; Qiu et al . , 2010 ; Tik et al . , 2018 ; Lin et al . , 2020 ) . For instance , when people came to an impasse in a complex problem , they needed to reconsider basic assumptions of the problem , reorient attention , and ﬁnd a new method ( Qiu et al . , 2010 ; Tang et al . , 2015 ) . Moreover , insightful problem - solving can induce positive feelings ( Jung - Beeman et al . , 2004 ) . Previous studies have shown that episodic and dispositional insight may share some common characteristics ( Byrne and Murray , 2005 ; Ovington et al . , 2016 ) . For instance , similar to the ﬁndings of episodic insight , individuals with high dispositional insight had great attention switching capacity ( Byrne and Murray , 2005 ) and positive aﬀect ( Ovington et al . , 2016 ) . In addition , compared to episodic insight , dispositional insight , a trait of personality , was found to be associated with high cognitive ﬂexibility and tendency to engage in eﬀortful mental activities , which may recruit more set - shifting and motivational components ( Gilhooly and Murphy , 2005 ; Ovington et al . , 2016 ) . Neurally , several underlying neural mechanisms in episodic insight have been described . Neuroimaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) indicated increased medial prefrontal cortex ( MPFC ) , temporal , and parietal activity in episodic insight ( Jung - Beeman et al . , 2004 ; Kounios et al . , 2006 ; Huang et al . , 2018 ) . For example , researchers employed a compound remote associates paradigm and found neural activity in the MPFC , superior temporal gyrus ( STG ) , and anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) accompanied insightful problem solving ( Jung - Beeman et al . , 2004 ; Kounios et al . , 2006 ; Tik et al . , 2018 ) . The occurrence of an insight experience was related to brain activation in the temporoparietal junction ( TPJ ) by using riddles as experimental materials ( Huang et al . , 2018 ) . Together , these ﬁndings suggest that MPFC and TPJ may be vital for episodic insight . Considering the commonalities between episodic and dispositional insight and their uniqueness , we hypothesized that dispositional insight can involve particular neural mechanisms in addition to the common neural mechanisms engaged in episodic insight . Recently , many studies used resting - state fMRI to explore the functional connectivity in creativity ( Takeuchi et al . , 2012 ; Beaty et al . , 2014 ; Chen et al . , 2014 ; Sun et al . , 2018 ) . For example , researchers detected that creative performance was associated with the resting - state functional connectivity ( RSFC ) between the inferior frontal gyrus and the default mode network ( Beaty et al . , 2014 ) . Takeuchi et al . ( 2012 ) reported that creativity was related to RSFC between the MPFC and posterior cingulate cortex using the task of divergent thinking . Furthermore , a previous study has combined the VBM with RSFC to evaluate the brain structural - functional relationships in creativity . Researchers employed the creative achievement questionnaire ( CAQ ) to calculate individual creativity in this study . Results showed that creativity was negatively correlated with the dorsal ACC’s regional gray matter volume ( rGMV ) . Creativity was also negatively associated with the RSFC between the dorsal ACC and medial superior frontal gyrus ( MSFG ) ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . However , few studies have used structural and functional analyses to explore the changed brain structure and RSFC in dispositional insight . Over the past decades , many studies have explored the relationship between personality characteristics and creativity ( King et al . , 1996 ; Batey , 2007 ; Furnham and Bachtiar , 2008 ; Li et al . , 2014 ; Sadana et al . , 2021 ) . For example , researchers used the NEO Personality Inventory and divergent thinking tests to study the linkage between personality and creativity . They found that creativity was signiﬁcantly correlated with extraversion and openness to experience ( King et al . , 1996 ) . Furthermore , several studies also identiﬁed that creativity potential was associated with high neuroticism ( Batey , 2007 ; Furnham and Bachtiar , 2008 ) . The ﬁndings mentioned above suggest that essential aspects of personality may play a pivotal role in creativity . In addition , researchers found that character was closely associated with brain structure ( DeYoung et al . , 2010 ; Kong et al . , 2015b ) . For example , neuroticism was related to structural variations in the STG and thalamus ( Kong et al . , 2015b ) . Furthermore , a previous study has indicated that personality can mediate the relationship between brain structure and trait creativity ( Li et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , we deduce that individual personality diﬀerences might mediate the relationship between dispositional insight and rGMV in particular brain regions . Previous studies have validated that using individuals’ performance on insight problems can estimate dispositional insight ( Jacobs and Dominowski , 1981 ; Ash and Wiley , 2006 ; DeCaro and Wieth , 2016 ; Ogawa et al . , 2018 ) . For instance , Jacobs and Dominowski ( 1981 ) used average performance ( i . e . , mean solution times ) on several classic insight problems , such as candle problems and two - string problems , to calculate the dispositional insight of each subject . Results showed signiﬁcant diﬀerences in insightful problem - solving performance between males and females . Recently , researchers utilized problem - solving Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 2 April 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 846377 fnbeh - 16 - 846377 April 9 , 2022 Time : 15 : 7 # 3 Lin et al . Brain Structures Underlying Dispositional Insight success ( i . e . , mean correct solution rates and solution times ) on insightful chunk decomposition problems ( i . e . , matchstick arithmetic problems ) to calculate the dispositional insight of each subject . They found that working memory can predict an individual’s ability to successfully solve insightful problems ( Ash and Wiley , 2006 ; DeCaro and Wieth , 2016 ) . Notably , insightful chunk decomposition problems were typically regarded as insight problems ( Knoblich et al . , 1999 ; DeCaro and Wieth , 2016 ) . For instance , in the matchstick arithmetic task ( i . e . , chunk decomposition task ) , subjects were required to transform wrong arithmetic equations , such as “XI = III + III , ” into true equations , such as “VI = III + III . ” To solve the problems , subjects should decompose the “X” into “V . ” This process involved cognitive restructuring , the deﬁning characteristic of insight problems ( Knoblich et al . , 1999 ) . However , the number of matchstick arithmetic problems is minimal . Researchers have recently developed a new insightful chunk decomposition task ( i . e . , insightful Chinese character chunk decomposition task ) , which can provide a suﬃcient number of insight problems ( Luo et al . , 2006 ; Wu et al . , 2009 ; Huang et al . , 2015 ) . Descriptions of the task can be found elsewhere ( Luo et al . , 2006 ; Wu et al . , 2009 ; Huang et al . , 2015 ) . Thus , in the present study , we used individuals’ performance ( i . e . , mean correct solution rates and solution times ) on insightful Chinese character chunk decomposition tasks to measure dispositional insight . Together , we aimed to study the relevance between altered brain structure associated with RSFC and dispositional insight . Notably , the RSFC analysis was to complement the ﬁndings of VBM analysis in this study . We used multi - modal brain structural MRI and resting - state fMRI analyses to detect the structural and functional neural mechanisms underlying dispositional insight . Based on the studies mentioned above , we hypothesized that rGMV and RSFC in the MPFC and TPJ might correlate with dispositional insight . Furthermore , we predicted that subjects’ personalities might mediate the linkage between dispositional insight and rGMV in particular brain regions . MATERIALS AND METHODS The current study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki . The Research Ethics Review Board of South China Normal University approved the present study . Subjects provided written informed consent before their participation in the current study . Subjects The sample included forty - four subjects ( 18 males , mean age 20 . 73 , range 18 – 27 ) . We determined the sample size according to a previous neuroimaging study ( Xiang et al . , 2016 ) . All the subjects were students from South China Normal University . They were screened by questionnaire to exclude subjects who have the history of neurological or psychiatric illness . All of them reported right - handed and had a normal or corrected - to - normal vision . FIGURE 1 | Schematic of experimental design . ( A ) Experimental procedures . ( B ) Exemplars of each condition in insight and ﬁller tasks . Insight Task The present study used individuals’ performance on the insightful Chinese character chunk decomposition tasks to measure individuals’ dispositional insight . Figure 1 shows the insight task and materials in the study . Notably , the diﬃculty of the experimental materials might potentially aﬀect the performance of subjects . For instance , if all the testing materials were too easy or diﬃcult for each subject , the result would reveal ceiling or ﬂoor eﬀects . Thus , we created two kinds of insightful Chinese character chunk decomposition which varies in diﬃculty , including low and high insightful Chinese character chunk decomposition conditions . Speciﬁcally , the low insight condition required subjects to transform the given character ( e . g . , “ ” ) into the target character ( e . g . , “ ” ) by discarding the to - be - removed character ( e . g . , “ ” ) . Notably , each given character ( e . g . , “ ” ) in this condition is a left - right structure , which comprises a radical ( e . g . , “ ” ) and a sub - character ( e . g . , “ ” ) . Meanwhile , each sub - character is a top - bottom structure that comprises a radical ( e . g . , “ ” ) and a character ( e . g . , “ ” ) . In the macroscopic view , it is easy for subjects to decompose the radical ( e . g . , “ ” ) from the given character ( e . g . , “ ” ) by intuition . In other words , it is easy to separate the radical ( e . g . , “ ” ) and the sub - character ( e . g . , “ ” ) , which fulﬁlls the expectations of subjects . Previous studies have veriﬁed that this radical - level character decomposition is easy and can be done through ordinary thinking ( Luo et al . , 2006 ; Huang et al . , 2015 ) . However , in this insight condition , subjects were required to decompose the to - be - removed character ( e . g . , “ ” ) , Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 3 April 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 846377 fnbeh - 16 - 846377 April 9 , 2022 Time : 15 : 7 # 4 Lin et al . Brain Structures Underlying Dispositional Insight not the radical ( e . g . , “ ” ) , from the given character ( e . g . , “ ” ) to constitute the target character ( e . g . , “ ” ) . This process violates subjects’ expectations and is creative for subjects to perform . In the high insight condition , subjects were also asked to change the given character ( e . g . , “ ” ) into the target character ( e . g . , “ ” ) by discarding the to - be - removed character ( e . g . , “ ” ) . However , in this insight condition , each target character ( e . g . , “ ” ) is visually embedded in the to - be - removed character ( e . g . , “ ” ) . Subjects are unfamiliar with these materials . Thus , they may adopt more creative ways to perform this decomposition . Filler tasks ( i . e . , ordinary Chinese character chunk decompositions ) , also comprising easy and diﬃcult conditions , were included in the present study ( Figure 1 ) . In the easy ordinary condition , subjects were asked to perform radical - level Chinese character chunk decompositions , such as decomposing given characters ( e . g . , “ ” ) into target characters ( e . g . , “ ” ) by discarding the to - be - removed parts ( e . g . , “ ” ) . In the diﬃcult ordinary condition , subjects were asked to perform stroke - level Chinese character chunk decompositions , such as decomposing given characters ( e . g . , “ ” ) into target characters ( e . g . , “ ” ) by discarding the to - be - removed parts ( e . g . , “ ” ) . Previous studies have proved that stroke - level Chinese character chunk decompositions were more complicated than the radical - level ones ( Luo et al . , 2006 ; Wu et al . , 2013 ) . Notably , we employed the ﬁller tasks to prevent subjects from deliberately using strategies in performing the insight tasks . Furthermore , the ﬁller tasks were randomly intermixed with the insight tasks to vary the charges and keep subjects’ attention on the tasks . In sum , there were four conditions in this study . The current experiment contained 160 trials , equally divided into two blocks , comprising 20 trials per condition . The sequence of trials was randomized . For each trial , subjects viewed a given character , a target character , and a to - be - removed portion . Firstly , the given character was presented centrally on the screen for 2 s . Then , a ﬁxation cross was presented for 1 s . After that , the target character was presented centrally on the screen for 6 s until participants responded . During this time , subjects were informed about changing the given character into the target character and ﬁnding a solution ( i . e . , ﬁnding the to - be - removed portion ) as quickly as they could within 6 s by pressing a key . Here , we recorded the subjects’ response times ( RTs ) . Finally , following a ﬁxation cross for 1s , a new portion was shown on the screen . Subjects determined whether this new portion was the same as one had previously found , then pressed the “F” or “J” key as quickly as they could in 3 s . Here , we recorded the subjects’ correct response rates ( CRs ) . In order to validate whether the insight task can induce an insightful experience or not , additional 20 subjects rated the creativity and “Aha ! ” experience of the insight and ﬁller tasks on a 5 - point scale . Results showed that the insight task ( M = 3 . 13 , SD = 0 . 37 ) was signiﬁcantly higher in creativity than the ﬁller task ( M = 1 . 53 , SD = 0 . 42 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Within the insight task , high insight trials ( M = 3 . 44 , SD = 0 . 37 ) were more creative than the low insight trials ( M = 2 . 82 , SD = 0 . 45 , p < 0 . 001 ) . In addition , the insight task ( M = 3 . 02 , SD = 0 . 38 ) induced more “Aha ! ” experience than the ﬁller task ( M = 1 . 44 , SD = 0 . 29 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Within the insight task , high insight trials ( M = 3 . 33 , SD = 0 . 41 ) induced more “Aha ! ” experience than the low insight trials ( M = 2 . 70 , SD = 0 . 43 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Therefore , the insightful Chinese character chunk decomposition was an insight task . After this behavioral experiment , all subjects received an MRI scan , including anatomical imaging ( 5 min ) and resting - state imaging ( 8 min ) . During the resting - state imaging , all subjects were required to relax and stay awake , with their eyes closed . Measures Dispositional Insight For each subject , we took both high and low insight tasks together to estimate the extent of dispositional insight . The mean RTs of both low and high insight tasks were calculated , then the mean CRs of low and high insight tasks were acquired . In the end , an inverse eﬃciency score ( IES : the ratio of mean RTs over mean CRs ) was computed and ﬁnally log - transformed to an approximately normal distribution ( Townsend and Ashby , 1978 ; Bruyer and Brysbaert , 2011 ; Reyes and Sackur , 2014 ) . Notably , the lower the transformed IES is , the higher the dispositional insight becomes . Personality In the current study , the Revised NEO Personality Inventory ( NEO - PI - R ) , IPIP - NEO - 120 , was employed to estimate the personality of each subject ( Costa , and McCrae , 1992 ) . Previous studies veriﬁed that this NEO - PI - R had high reliability and validity in Chinese populations ( Yang et al . , 1999 ; Kong et al . , 2015a ; Xiang et al . , 2016 ; Kajonius and Mac Giolla , 2017 ) . In brief , the NEO - PI - R measures ﬁve diﬀerent dimensions of personality : neuroticism , extraversion , openness to experience , agreeableness , and conscientiousness . The NEO - PI - R comprises 120 items , with 24 items per dimension . Subjects should respond to each item on a 5 - point Likert scale , which ranges from strong disagreement to strong agreement . Notably , negatively worded items were reversely coded before all analyses . Image Acquisition Scanning was conducted on a 3 T Siemens Trio Tim MR scanner with a 12 - channel phased - array head coil in SCNU , Guangzhou , China . Brieﬂy , the T1 - weighted images were acquired with a magnetization - prepared rapid acquisition gradient - echo ( MPRAGE ) sequence ( TR / TE / FA / thickness : 1900 ms / 2 . 52 ms / 9 ◦ / 1 . 0 mm ; matrix size : 256 × 256 ; FOV : 256 × 256 mm 2 ; 176 sagittal slices ) . The resting - state fMRI data were obtained using an Echo Planar Imaging ( EPI ) sequence ( TR / TE / FA / thickness : 2000 ms / 30 ms / 90 ◦ / 3 . 5 mm ; matrix size : 64 × 64 ; FOV : 204 × 204 mm 2 ; 33 axial slices ) . Voxel - Based Morphometry The computational anatomy toolbox 12 ( CAT 12 toolbox 1 ) was adopted to perform the VBM analysis of structural images . In the present study , we utilized the suggested default settings of the CAT 12 toolbox to preprocess the structural images .

In addition , the total intracranial volume ( TIV ) was computed in the present study . Resting - State Functional Connectivity The functional brain data were entered into the DPABI software package 3 and received preprocessing ( Yan et al . , 2016 ) . Brie ? y , the suggested standard procedure incorporated the following steps : ( 1 ) removing the ﬁrst ten images , ( 2 ) slice - time correction , ( 3 ) head - motion correction , ( 4 ) normalizing the images into the MNI template by using the T1 image for coregistration , ( 5 ) smoothing the images by using a 4 mm full - width half - maximum ( FWHM ) Gaussian ﬁlter , ( 6 ) signal linear detrending , ( 7 ) removing nuisance signal ( WM and CSF signal , and Friston 24 - parameters of head motion ) ( Yan et al . , 2013 ; Wu et al . , 2019 ) , ( 8 ) temporal ﬁltering ( 0 . 01 - 0 . 08 HZ ) . Notably , this study estimated the 6 - parameters of head motion , and all the subjects met the criteria ( translation < 2 . 5 mm and rotation < 2 . 5 ◦ ) . In addition , the Friston 24 - parameters of head motion were also computed , and the mean framewise displacement ( FD ) of head motion was acquired and subsequently used as a regressor of no interest to be regressed out in the statistical analysis ( Yan et al . , 2013 ) . In the RSFC analysis , the brain regions showing signiﬁcant correlations between the rGMV and dispositional insight were selected as the seed regions to compute the voxel - wise functional connectivity . Firstly , for each seed region , the mean time course of the seed region was calculated . Secondly , we calculated Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcients between the mean time course of the seed region and the time course of all other brain voxels . Thirdly , for normality purposes , the correlation coeﬃcients were transformed to z - scores ( i . e . , Fisher’s r - to - z transformation ) . Finally , the seed - based z - RSFC map 2 http : / / www . neuro . uni - jena . de / cat12 / CAT12 - Manual . pdf 3 http : / / rfmri . org / dpabi was acquired for each subject and subsequently entered into statistical analyses . Statistical Analyses Voxel - Based Morphometry In the group - level analysis , a multiple regression model was utilized to explore the structural mechanisms of dispositional insight . In other words , based on the preprocessed structural images , we planned to identify the brain regions in which the rGMV was correlated with dispositional insight ( measured by IES ) . In this model , the IES was used as the regressor of interest . Meanwhile , since several studies indicated that factors of sex , age , and TIV could aﬀect the brain structure , the inﬂuence factors of sex , age , and TIV were regressed out ( Malone et al . , 2015 ; Lin et al . , 2017 ) . For multiple comparisons correction , the statistical maps were thresholded at voxel - wise uncorrected p < 0 . 005 and cluster - extent FWE corrected p < 0 . 05 ( Hayasaka et al . , 2004 ; Wang et al . , 2018 ) . Resting - State Functional Connectivity In the group - level analysis , a multiple regression model based on the z - RSFC maps was built . We planned to ﬁnd out the brain regions showing correlations between the RSFC and dispositional insight ( measured by IES ) . Speciﬁcally , in this model , the IES was entered as the regressor of interest ; gender , age , and mean FD of head motion were entered as the regressors of no interest ( Wu et al . , 2019 ) . The multiple comparisons correction here was the same as the one used in the VBM analysis . Mediation Analysis To examine whether the personality can mediate the linkage between the dispositional insight and brain structure or not , a mediation model was built by using the PROCESS macro ( Preacher and Hayes , 2008 ; Xiang et al . , 2016 ) . In this model , the brain structure ( i . e . , rGMV value ) was used as an independent variable ( X ) , and the dispositional insight ( i . e . , IES value ) was used as a dependent variable ( Y ) . Then , the personality was set as a mediating variable ( M ) . We aimed to test the eﬀects of X on Y through M . Following previous studies ( Li et al . , 2014 ; Xiang et al . , 2016 ) , we didn’t control other personality dimensions when entering one personality dimension as M . Notably , we utilized a bootstrap procedure ( n = 10000 ) to validate the impact of X on Y through M . A 95 % conﬁdence interval which does not incorporate 0 implies that the indirect eﬀect is signiﬁcant at the 0 . 05 level .

Brain Structures Underlying Dispositional Insight RESULTS Behavioral Results Firstly , we found that the high insight condition was longer in RTs [ t ( 43 ) = 5 . 93 , p < 0 . 001 ] and lower in CRs [ t ( 43 ) = - 5 . 56 , p < 0 . 001 ] than the low insight condition , reﬂecting the validity of our manipulations on the degree of insight . Notably , we used RTs and CRs to calculate the IES ( an index of dispositional insight ) . Secondly , the mean ( SD ) , range , skewness , and kurtosis of the IES and the score of each personality were computed and listed in Table 1 . The kurtosis and skewness of each score varied from - 1 to + 1 , suggesting normality of the score ( Marcoulides and Hershberger , 1997 ; Xiang et al . , 2016 ) .

Resting - State Functional Connectivity Figure 3 shows the results of the seed - based RSFC analysis . The brain regions of TLM . L , DMPFC . L , and TPJ . R derived from VBM analysis were selected as seed regions . Results showed that the RSFC between the seed region of DMPFC . L and the regions of TPJ . L and TPJ .

Mediation Analysis Figure 4 shows that the personality of neuroticism mediates the relationship between the cluster of TLM . L and dispositional insight ( estimated by IES ) . Speciﬁcally , we ﬁrst investigated the relationship between each personality ( i . e . , neuroticism , extraversion , openness to experience , agreeableness , or conscientiousness ) and dispositional insight . We found that only neuroticism exhibited a signiﬁcant correlation with IES TABLE 2 | Clusters exhibiting signiﬁcant and positive correlations with the IES in the VBM analyses .

Subsequently , we tested whether brain structures associated with dispositional insight ( TLM . L , DMPFC . L , and TPJ . R ) could be correlated with neuroticism . We detected that only the rGMV in the TLM . L showed a signiﬁcant correlation with neuroticism ( r = - 0 . 38 , p = 0 . 012 , see Figure 4 ) . The ﬁndings implied that neuroticism was associated with both dispositional insight and rGMV in the TLM . L . Finally , to clarify this relationship further , we conducted a mediation model to test whether neuroticism can mediate the linkage between the rGMV in the TLM . L and dispositional insight or not . Speciﬁcally , we examined the linkage between the rGMV in the TLM . L and the IES without regressing out neuroticism . We found that rGMV in the TLM . L exhibited a signiﬁcant correlation with IES ( β = 0 . 49 , p = 0 . 001 ) . When regressing out the neuroticism , the correlation between the TLM . L and IES was still signiﬁcant but decreased a little ( β = 0 . 37 , p = 0 . 011 ) . In addition , the bootstrap procedure ( n = 10000 ) validated that neuroticism mediated the linkage between the TLM . L volume and IES ( 95 % conﬁdence interval = [ 0 . 049 , 1 . 406 ] , p < 0 . 05 ) . DISCUSSION The present study aimed to study the changed brain structure and RSFC associations with dispositional insight . The VBM analysis found that IES ( an index of dispositional insight ) was positively correlated with the rGMV in the TLM . L , TPJ . R , and DMPFC . L . In the RSFC analysis , we found that IES was positively correlated with the RSFC of TPJ . R - TPJ . L , TPJ . R - DLPFC . L , TPJ . R - VLPFC . L , TPJ . R - DMPFC . L , TPJ . R - INS . R , TPJ . R - CRBL . R , DMPFC . L - TPJ . L , and DMPFC . L - TPJ . R . The RSFC analysis was to complement the ﬁndings of VBM analysis . Notably , the lower the IES is , the higher the dispositional insight becomes . Thus , dispositional insight is negatively correlated with the rGMV and RSFC of relevant brain regions .

Brain Structures Underlying Dispositional Insight FIGURE 2 | Whole - brain VBM analyses showing three clusters exhibiting signiﬁcant and positive correlations with the IES ( an index of dispositional insight ) .

L volume and IES . The TLM is a hub region widely connected with the whole brain ( Van Den Heuvel and Sporns , 2011 ) . It is mainly responsible for relaying information and involves reward processing ( Gazzaniga , 2004 ; Boccia et al . , 2015 ; Jung et al . , 2015 ; Takeuchi et al . , 2017 ; Cristofori et al . , 2018 ; Tik et al . , 2018 ) . Previous studies on divergent thinking found that reduced dopamine receptors in the TLM were associated with reduced information ﬁltering and reduced inhibition of prefrontal neurons , which contributed to performances requiring increased ﬂexibility ( Jung et al . , 2015 ) . A previous study indicated that expected reward can facilitate insight problem solving ( Cristofori et al . , 2018 ) . In insight problem solving , problem solvers needed to perform a variety of solution attempts to ﬁnd the correct solution ( Bowden and Jung - Beeman , 2003 ) . Therefore , the dispositional insight correlated with TLM may indicate a relationship between dispositional insight and information searching , and reward processing . In addition , TPJ is generally believed to act as a core region involved in attention reorienting and forming novel associations ( Qiu et al . , 2008 ; Berkowitz and Ansari , 2010 ; Chang et al . , 2013 ) . Previous studies indicated that attentional resources should be deployed to prevent reorienting to distracting stimuli during divergent thinking ( Corbetta et al . , 2008 ; Benedek et al . , 2014b ) . Task - fMRI studies suggested that TPJ prevented irrelevant objects from being attended and formed new associations in the insight process ( Qiu et al . , 2008 ; Tang et al . , 2015 ) . The dispositional insight correlated with TPJ may indicate a linkage between dispositional insight and attention reorienting , and forming associations . Importantly , DMPFC plays a critical role in conﬂict regulation and cognitive control ( Egner and Hirsch , 2005 ; Krebs et al . , 2013 ; Benedek et al . , 2014a ) . Our ﬁndings were in line with previous studies on creativity ( Beaty and Silvia , 2012 ; Benedek et al . , 2013 , 2014a ) . For example , generating creative ideas was associated with top - down control and executive processes ( Benedek et al . , 2013 ) . In creative thinking , individual need to inhibit numerous competing responses before a suitable response was found ( Benedek et al . , 2014a ) . Moreover , inhibiting the dominant mental sets and forming new representations were crucial for episode insight ( Bowden and Jung - Beeman , 2003 ) . Taken together , altered brain structure in the DMPFC might be associated with dispositional insight . In addition , dispositional insight was negatively correlated with the RSFC of TPJ . R - TPJ . L , TPJ . R - DLPFC . L , TPJ . R - VLPFC . L , TPJ . R - DMPFC . L , TPJ . R - INS . R , TPJ . R - CRBL . R , DMPFC . L - TPJ . L , and DMPFC . L - TPJ . R . Lateral prefrontal cortex , including the DLPFC and VLPFC , involves inhibition of dominant but irrelevant responses and cognitive ﬂexibility ( Derrfuss et al . , 2005 ; Volle et al . , 2011 ) . Usually , the cerebellum is linked to working memory and executive functions ( Ravizza et al . , 2005 ; Keren - Happuch et al . , 2014 ) .

Insula is associated with subjective emotion ( Quartz , 2009 ; Singer et al . , 2009 ) . In the insightful tasks , insight solutions often evoked “aha” feelings ( Bowden and Jung - Beeman , 2007 ; Gonen - Yaacovi et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , we speculate that activations in the lateral prefrontal cortex , cerebellum , and insula may imply a link between the dispositional insight , cognitive inhibition , and “aha” feelings . Notably , previous studies indicated that the involvement of the frontal and parieto - temporal networks might be associated with creative generation tasks ( Takeuchi et al . , 2010 ; Gonen - Yaacovi et al . , 2013 ; Lin et al . , 2020 ) . In a task - fMRI study , an insight solution involved more robust functional connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and temporal cortex than a non - insight solution ( Zhao et al . , 2014 ) . Consistent with these studies , we found that the RSFC between the frontal and parieto - temporal regions involved dispositional insight . In sum , we infer that speciﬁc brain structures associated with RSFC contribute to dispositional insight . Finally , we detected that neuroticism mediated the link between the TLM . L and dispositional insight . Speciﬁcally , our ﬁndings highlighted that rGMV of the TLM . L was signiﬁcantly correlated with neuroticism . Several studies have revealed associations between the TLM and neuroticism ( Takano et al . , 2007 ; Servaas et al . , 2013 ; Kong et al . , 2015b ) . For example , there was a relationship between serotonin transporter binding in the TLM and neuroticism ( Takano et al . , 2007 ) . Moreover , imaging research suggested that neuroticism was related to structural variations in the TLM ( Kong et al . , 2015b ) . Previous studies revealed that individuals with higher neuroticism tended to accompany anxiety and worry emotional states ( Carver et al . , 2000 ; Leung et al . , 2014 ) . The emotional states facilitated analyses of complex problems and attainments of desired outcomes to prevent adverse eﬀects ( Andrews and Thomson , 2009 ; Leung et al . , 2014 ) . Besides , researches suggested that individuals with high scores on neuroticism tended to dwell on problems and recruit many rumination - related processes , such as worrying , which were helpful for creative problem - solving ( Perkins et al . , 2015 ) . Individuals with higher neuroticism could generate many unusual thoughts in the idea generation tasks ( Leung et al . , 2014 ) . These studies imply that neuroticism might facilitate insightful performances , in line with our ﬁndings suggested that neuroticism was positively correlated with dispositional insight . It is rational that neuroticism plays a mediation role in the relationship between TLM and dispositional insight . Considering the important role of TLM in dispositional insight , the TML was further decoded for cognitive terms with Neurosynth toolbox 4 to depict the functional validity of the TLM ( Rubin et al . , 2017 ) . The top 50 terms were ﬁrst selected , from which we only reported the top ﬁve terms related to speciﬁc cognitive and emotional functions in descending order . Results showed that terms were closely correlated with anticipation , monetary reward , hypoactivation , sensations , and mood . This ﬁnding is in line with previous studies , where insight could involve the processes of reward , active searching , and mood ( i . e . , “aha” feelings ) ( Cristofori et al . , 2018 ; Tik et al . , 2018 ) . Therefore , the dispositional insight correlated with TLM may indicate a relationship between dispositional insight , reward processing , active searching , and emotional processing . However , the results from the decoding analysis were descriptive , and further studies need to clarify this issue . The present study found that dispositional insight was negatively correlated with the rGMV and RSFC of speciﬁc 4 https : / / www . neurosynth . org / Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 8 April 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 846377 fnbeh - 16 - 846377 April 9 , 2022 Time : 15 : 7 # 9 Lin et al . Brain Structures Underlying Dispositional Insight brain regions . Consistently , evidence from previous studies supported the association ( Chen et al . , 2014 ; Li et al . , 2014 ) . For instance , Chen et al . ( 2014 ) found that trait creativity was negatively correlated with the rGMV in the dorsal ACC and the RSFC between the dorsal ACC and MSFC . However , there were contradictory studies indicating an inconsistent association ( Gansler et al . , 2011 ; Takeuchi et al . , 2012 ; Beaty et al . , 2014 ; Li et al . , 2014 ; Zhao et al . , 2014 ) . For instance , Li et al . ( 2014 ) reported that creative subjects had increased rGMV in the middle temporal gyrus . Takeuchi et al . ( 2012 ) showed that trait creativity was positively related to the RSFC between the MPFC and posterior cingulate cortex . In fact , it is hard to explain the relationship between decreased or increased rGMV and creativity . Previous studies indicated that increased rGMV reﬂects neuroplasticity , which may be helpful for task performance ( Draganski et al . , 2006 ; Chen et al . , 2014 ) . However , other studies showed that decreased rGMV reﬂects neuronal pruning processes , which may be related to better cognitive performance ( Kanai and Rees , 2011 ; Duan et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , we speculated that neuronal pruning processes might be the reason for decreased rGMV , contributing to high dispositional insight in this study . In addition , previous studies suggested a consistent relationship between gray matter alteration and RSFC ( Chen et al . , 2014 ; Niu et al . , 2018 ) . For instance , in a trait creativity study , researchers found that decreased rGMV in the dorsal ACC appears to result in the reduced RSFC within the salience network ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , we deduced that decreased rGMV might be the reason for decreased RSFC , contributing to high dispositional insight in this study . Finally , we didn’t estimate Chinese language abilities of subjects in the present study . However , we recruited the student subjects randomly , who have passed the college entrance examination . We assumed that they have similar language abilities . CONCLUSION The present study utilized a multi - modal imaging method to reveal the structural and functional mechanisms underlying dispositional insight . We found that rGMV in the TLM , TPJ , and DMPFC was related to dispositional insight . Altered RSFC of the frontal and parieto - temporal regions also involved dispositional insight . In addition , neuroticism was proved to be a mediational mechanism explaining the link between the TLM volume and dispositional insight . Our study provides a new understanding of the brain structure and functions underlying dispositional insight .
