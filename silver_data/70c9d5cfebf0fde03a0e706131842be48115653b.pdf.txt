Eur J Appl Physiol ( 2009 ) 106 : 389 – 398 DOI 10 . 1007 / s00421 - 009 - 1032 - 7 123 ORIGINAL ARTICLE Mechano - transduction to muscle protein synthesis is modulated by FAK Stephan Klossner · Anne - Cecile Durieux · Damien Freyssenet · Martin Flueck Accepted : 2 March 2009 / Published online : 18 March 2009 © Springer - Verlag 2009 Abstract We examined the involvement of focal adhe - sion kinase ( FAK ) in mechano - regulated signalling to pro - tein synthesis by combining muscle - targeted transgenesis with a physiological model for un - and reloading of hind - limbs . Transfections of mouse tibialis anterior muscle with a FAK expression construct increased FAK protein 1 . 6 - fold versus empty transfection in the contralateral leg and elevated FAK concentration at the sarcolemma . Altered activation status of phosphotransfer enzymes and down - stream translation factors showed that FAK overexpression was functionally important . FAK auto - phosphorylation on Y397 was enhanced between 1 and 6 h of reloading and preceded the activation of p70S6K after 24 h of reloading . Akt and translation initiation factors 4E - BP1 and 2A , which reside up - or downstream of p70S6K , respectively , showed no FAK - modulated regulation . The W ndings iden - tify FAK as an upstream element of the mechano - sensory pathway of p70S6K activation whose Akt - independent reg - ulation intervenes in control of muscle mass by mechanical stimuli in humans . Keywords Focal adhesion kinase · S6 kinase · Akt · eIF4E - BP1 · Gene electrotransfer Introduction Striated muscle demonstrates a pronounced load - dependent phenotype ( Fluck and Hoppeler 2003 ) . This is illustrated by the dramatic reduction in mass of anti - gravitational muscles with unloading and the induction of hypertrophy with sub - sequent reloading . Biochemical investigations point out that modulated protein synthesis is a main mechanism underlying the early regulation in protein turnover with altered muscle loading ( Rennie 2007 ) . Protein phosphorylation is a central theme in the regula - tion of protein synthesis ( Chiquet and Flück 2002 ; Hunter 2000 ) . Studies focusing on the molecular control of muscle size identi W ed a number of signalling pathways that control protein synthesis via the phosphorylation of translation fac - tors at critical amino acids , thus regulating their activity . It is known that the phospho - transfer enzymes ( kinases ) mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) and Akt are orga - nized in a pathway that enhances translational e Y ciency ( Bodine et al . 2001 ; Deldicque et al . 2008 ; Pallafacchina et al . 2002 ) . This occurs via downstream activation of 70 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase ( p70S6K ) and critical transla - tion initiation factors ( e . g . eIF4E - BP1 , eEF2 ) ( Gingras et al . 2001 ; Sandri 2008 ) . The physiological regulation of this signalling pathway supports the view that protein syn - thesis is controlled by muscle activity via enhanced loading ( Sandri 2008 ) . In this respect , the activation of p70S6K cor - relates best with the gains in muscle mass induced by mechanical stimuli ( Baar and Esser 1999 ; Burry et al . 2007 ; Nader and Esser 2001 ) . This activation occurs when the Akt - mTOR pathway is not activated ( Deldicque et al . 2008 ; S . Klossner · A . - C . Durieux · M . Flueck Institute of Anatomy , University of Berne , Berne , Switzerland D . Freyssenet Faculté de Médecine , Université Jean Monnet , Saint - Etienne , France M .

This indicates that Akt - mTOR and p70S6K independently regulate protein synthesis . The mechano - responsive path - way which connects to p70S6K activation is not known . The integrin - associated focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) is a mechano - sensitive signalling molecule ( Durieux et al . 2007 ) , which is positioned upstream of p70S6K in cell culture ( Gan et al . 2006 ; Malik and Parsons 1996 ) . FAK localises to sarco - lemmal focal adhesion sites , which play an important role in the conversion of mechanical stress to myocellular hypertro - phy signalling ( Fluck et al . 2002 ; Ingber 2006 ; Romer et al . 2006 ; Samarel 2005 ) . A possible functional coupling between the activation of p70S6K and FAK is suggested by the observation that the phosphotransfer activity and phos - phorylation status of both kinases correlate with protein syn - thesis and load - dependent increases in muscle mass ( Cary and Guan 1999 ; Fluck et al . 2002 ; Ingber 2006 ) . We hypothesized that mechano - signalling between FAK and p70S6K is the missing molecular connection between mechanical muscle stimulation and activation of muscle pro - tein synthesis ( Baar and Esser 1999 ; Gan et al . 2006 ; Kimball et al . 2004 ) . Towards this end , we tested whether muscle W bre - targeted FAK overexpression ( Durieux et al . 2002 , 2004 ) would enhance activation of p70S6K in tibialis anterior ( TA ) muscle of mice in a load - dependent manner ( Gingras et al . 2001 ; Kimball et al . 1998 ; Sale et al . 1999 ) . This was assessed in a physiological model which allows prolonged muscle unloading and subsequent reloading ( Dapp et al . 2004 ) . We were interested in elucidating the time course and relationship of the early FAK activation ( Gordon et al . 2001 ) to the putative downstream phosphorylation of p70S6K and explored whether this pathway distinguishes to regulatory activation of p70S6K by Akt - mTOR and downstream phos - phorylation of key translation factors eIF4E - BP1 , eEF2 ( Baar et al . 2006 ; Baar and Esser 1999 ; Gingras et al . 2001 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Methods Materials Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) promoter - driven expression plas - mid encoding chicken FAK gene ( pCMV - FAK ) or an empty plasmid ( pCMV ) were isolated under endotoxin - free conditions at Plasmid Factory GmbH ( Bielefeld , Germany , www . plasmidfactory . de ) . Fluorescent - compatible mount - ing medium was from DAKO ( DAKO , Carpinteria , CA , USA ) . Bicinchoninic acid assay reagents and protein A Sepharose were from Sigma ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) . The deployed antibodies against the signalling molecules in focus and the veri W ed phosphorylation sites involved in their regulation are summarized in Table 1 . Per - oxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies goat anti - rabbit IgG and goat anti - mouse whole IgG were obtained from ICN Biomedicals GMBH ( Germany ) . Alexa Fluor ® 488 - conjugated goat - anti - rabbit IgG antibody was from Molec - ular probes ( Invitrogen Ltd , Paisley , UK ) . Super Signal West Femto Kit and Kodak XAR5 W lms were from Pierce ( Perbio Science , Lausanne , Switzerland ) and Sigma ( Buchs , Switzerland ) , respectively . Animals The animal protocol was approved by the Animal Protec - tion Commission of the Canton Berne , Switzerland . The 6 - month - old male mice 129 / SVEV weighed 35 . 4 § 0 . 7 g ( n = 17 ) before the intervention . They were housed individ - ually in a temperature - controlled room ( 21°C ) with a 12 : 12 h light – dark cycle . Animals were allowed food and water ad libitum . Gene electro transfer Intramuscular gene transfer was achieved via injection of plasmid DNA and subsequent electric pulse delivery in both legs basically as previously described ( Durieux et al . 2002 ; Durieux et al . 2004 ; Pallafacchina et al . 2002 ) . The mice were individually anesthetized with iso X urane and the lower limbs were shaved . Twenty - W ve microgram of expression plasmid in 25 (cid:1) l physiological saline solution ( 0 . 9 % NaCl ) was injected with a sterile 100 (cid:1) l syringe into the tibialis anterior ( TA ) muscle . After 5 min of incubation , electric pulses ( 2 trains of 100 pulses of 100 (cid:1) s each at 50 mA ) were delivered at four di V erent locations in the belly portion using the GET42 pulser with needle elec - trodes ( E . I . P . Electronique et Informatique du Pilat , Jon - zieux , France ) . This technique allows to maintain the overexpression for more than 1 week ( Fluck et al . 2008 ) . Typically , mice recovered rapidly from this procedure and began to move freely 2 h after the intervention .

Eur J Appl Physiol ( 2009 ) 106 : 389 – 398 391 123 Modulation of muscle loading Animals were subjected to either of W ve di V erent loading conditions basically as previously described ( Dapp et al . 2004 ; Fluck et al . 2005 ) . Two days after the gene electro - transfer , animals were subjected to 7 days of hindlimb unloading ( HU ) by tail suspension or kept as cage controls ( CC ) . Subsequently , a set of suspended animals was sub - jected to reloading for 1 h ( R1 ) , 6 h ( R6 ) or 24 h ( R24 ) . Cage activity was encouraged in the W rst hour of reloading by tipping the W nger into the suspension cage . TA muscles were harvested from anesthetized animals , rapidly weighed , frozen in nitrogen - cooled isopentane and stored at ¡ 70°C for subsequent analysis . Confocal microscopy The subcellular localization of FAK was detected on cryo - sections as previously described ( Flück et al . 1999 ; Fluck et al . 2002 ) , but with the modi W cation that X uorescent - labelled secondary antibodies were used . The deployed pri - mary FAK antibody A - 17 was applied at a 1 : 100 dilution in 0 . 3 % BSA / PBS , reacted with 200 - fold diluted Alexa488 - conjugated anti - rabbit IgG and embedded in X uorescent - compatible mounting medium . Fluorescence and digital phase contrasts were analyzed with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope ( Leica Microsystem CMS , Mylton Keynes , UK ) . The subcellular localization of FAK was ana - lyzed on cryosections of cage control , of 6 h and of 24 h reloaded animals combined together . Sarcolemmal and sar - coplasmic FAK staining was quanti W ed with the colocaliza - tion macro of Leica Application Suite . Signals were calculated from the mean of integrated channel intensity of the sarcoplasmic and sarcolemmal region of each W bre along six parallel “optical slices” at 10 (cid:1) m distance . Six W bres were quanti W ed per treatment . Raw data were exported for statistical analysis . Immunoblotting SDS - PAGE , western blotting and immunodetection were performed with speci W c antibodies ( Table 1 ) as previously described ( Flück et al . 1999 ; Gordon et al . 2001 ) . Standard - ized amounts of protein ( 20 (cid:1) g ) were loaded per well . Sig - nal was recorded with enhanced chemiluminescence by using the Super Signal West Femto Kit and Kodak XAR5 W lms . The signal intensity of the speci W c protein band was determined using the line and band density mode in the Quantity One 1 - D analysis software 4 . 6 . 1 ( Bio - Rad , Life Science Research , Hercules , CA , USA ) . FAK phosphorylation on Y397 was determined after immunoprecipitation . One milligram of soluble protein in 750 (cid:1) l RIPA bu V er was isolated and combined with 1 (cid:1) l pFAK serum from BioSource and 10 (cid:1) l p - FAK from Santa Cruz . Five milligram Protein A Sepharose ( Sigma ) was added and incubated with shaking at 4°C for 2 h . After incubation of antibodies with the protein sample over night , the immunocomplexes were precipitated by centrifugation Table 1 Name , function , epitope and source of all primary antibodies used to identify FAK - dependent signalling in this study Antibody Function Epitope Source FAK Tyrosine kinase N - terminal ( A - 17 ) Santa Cruz , CA , USA FAK Tyrosine kinase C - terminal ( Lulu ) Gift from A .

Proteins were subsequently subjected to immunoblotting for FAK protein with antibody “Lulu” ( Table 1 ) . In vitro S6 kinase activity assay Phosphotransfer activity of p70S6K was evaluated in vitro . S6 kinase phosphorylation was initiated by the addition of 75 (cid:1) g protein homogenate to 45 (cid:1) l preheated phosphoryla - tion mixture including S6K substrate peptide ( RRRLR - RLRA ) at 30°C basically as described ( Akimoto et al . 1998 ; Napoli et al . 1998 ) . The reaction was stopped after 5 min by spotting 20 (cid:1) l on a Whatman P81 W lter and by washing in 75 mM H 3 PO 4 and acetone ( Fluck et al . 2000 ) . Quanti W cation of incorporated 32P was performed by liquid scintillation counting . Two technical replicas were mea - sured from each sample . Background values ( radioactivity background : same reaction without homogenate ; homoge - nate background : same reaction without substrate peptide ) were subtracted . Statistics For immunoblotting , samples from contralateral muscle pairs ( i . e . pCMV - FAK and pCMV - transfected TA ) were separated in adjacent lanes of the SDS - PAGE gel and a ref - erence sample was run in all gels . Data were related to the reference sample . Statistical analysis was carried out with Statistica 6 . 1 ( StatSoft Europe , Hamburg , Germany ) . The expression and phosphorylation level in pCMV - transfected muscles , as well as body and muscle weight , were evalu - ated with a one - factor analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) . Di V erences between pCMV - transfected and pCMV - FAK muscle pairs were analyzed with a Friedman - ANOVA with repeated measurements . Subsequently , a Fisher post hoc test was carried out to localize the e V ect . Linear regression analysis was carried out with Pearson correlation . A p value of 0 . 05 was selected as the signi W cance level for all tests . Values are given as means § standard error ( SE ) . Results Interaction of electrotransfer and muscle loading TA muscle pairs of adult mice were subjected to gene elec - trotransfer . The right TA muscle was transfected with con - stitutive - active plasmid for chicken FAK , i . e . pCMV - FAK . The contralateral TA was transfected with an empty pCMV plasmid . Subsequently , animals were subjected to the di V erent loading protocols . 7 days of unloading produced the expected drop in body weight , which did not recover within 24 h of reloading ( Table 2 ) . The ratio of the TA muscle to the body weight was unchanged and not a V ected by the unloading and reloading for both transfections . FAK overexpression The expression level and localization of FAK protein in transfected TA muscle was analyzed by immunoblotting and immuno X uorescence . Figure 2a and b depict FAK - immunolocalization after pCMV - FAK transfection in a sin - gle positive W bre . Figure 2c shows the mosaic pattern of FAK localisation after pCMV - FAK transfection at a lower magni W cation . The amount of FAK localized in the sarco - lemma was threefold higher than the amount of FAK in the sarcoplasm , regardless of the muscle loading ( Fig . 2d ) . A proportion of W bres in empty - transfected muscle demon - strated FAK - immunostaining , but staining intensity was substantially more pronounced in pCMV - FAK transfected muscle ( data not shown ) . Gene electrotransfer also caused muscle W bre damage in the transfected region , which was comparable for both conditions of transfection ( data not shown ) . Qualitative immunoblotting identi W ed a 1 . 6 - fold increase in FAK protein levels in cage controls 9 days after electrotransfer ( Fig . 3a ) . The FAK protein was detected as a single band at 125 kDa in empty and chicken FAK trans - fected mouse TA muscles ( Fig . 3b ) . E V ect of muscle loading on FAK overexpression and activity The di V erence in FAK expression was load - dependent .

This increase in FAK pro - tein with reloading was preceded by enhanced phosphory - lation of FAK on the major activation site Y397 after 1 h of reloading ( Fig . 3c , d ) . This tyrosine phosphorylation with reloading was transient and lost after 24 h of reloading . Load - dependent p70S6K - signalling We tested whether the added mechanical stress of reloading in combination with FAK - overexpression would activate p70S6K in muscle deconditioned by unloading . Unloading did not bring about signi W cant di V erences in p70S6K amount , phosphorylation and phosphotransfer activity between pCMV - FAK - and pCMV transfected TA muscles ( Fig . 4a – d ) . Subsequent reloading altered the phosphoryla - tion status of p70S6K in deconditioned TA muscle both qualitatively and quantitatively : 6 h after the W rst ground contact of hindlimbs , p70S6K was increasingly phosphory - lated on the dual site T421 / S424 in pCMV - FAK transfected muscle versus their contralateral controls . This response peaked after 24 h of reloading ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Phosphorylation on S411 showed a near trend for FAK - transfection medi - ated elevation 6 h after reloading ( p = 0 . 10 ) . Functionally important regulation of p70S6K by loading was empha - sized by a signi W cant 3 . 8 - fold enhanced p70S6K - phospho - transfer activity in pCMV - FAK - versus pCMV transfected muscle after 24 h of reloading ( Fig . 4c ) . p70S6K protein levels were not a V ected by reloading between FAK over - expressing and contralateral control muscle ( Fig . 4d ) . p70S6K phosphorylation status of the veri W ed sites pS411 and pT421 / S424 and phosphotransfer activity of p70S6K during the reloading response were signi W cantly correlated for both transfection conditions ( i . e . pS411 : r = 0 . 73 ; pT421 / S424 : r = 0 . 60 ) . To test whether this activation of p70S6K was induced by an activation of Akt , we analyzed the phosphorylation status of Akt on its major phosphorylation sites T308 ( Fig . 5a ) and S473 ( Fig . 5b ) . No activation of Akt was detected throughout the intervention .

Neither phosphorylation on the key regulatory sites T37 / T46 in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 ( eIF4E - BP1 ) nor the activating site S52 in the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha ( eIF2A ) were signi W cantly a V ected by the introduction of FAK ( Fig . 6a , b ) . Reloading per se increased ; however , S52 phosphorylation of eIF2A after one hour of reloading in both transfection conditions . The total protein content of eIF2 was unchanged ( data not shown ) . eIF2A pS52 was negatively correlated to p70S6K pT421 / S424 and eIF4E - BP1 pT37 / T46 phosphorylation . Discussion Mechano - transduction : from FAK to an activation of protein synthesis Our molecular analysis demonstrates that the experimental enhancement of FAK - signalling transduces a mechanically imposed stimulus to the delayed activation of p70S6K - signalling . The temporal relationships between FAK and p70S6K - phosphorylation and phosphotransfer activity establish that the load - modulated signalling pathway of translation control in muscle is modulated by FAK . The time - course and speci W city of p70S6K phosphorylation allows important regulatory conclusions on the pathway connecting FAK to p70S6K activation . The FAK - modu - lated phosphorylation on S411 and the dual phosphoryla - tion T421 and S424 of p70S6K points to the involvement of serine / threonine kinases since FAK activity explicitly tar - gets tyrosine residues . The measured p70S6K phosphoryla - tion sites are targeted by numerous kinases , including PI3K ( Dardevet et al . 1996 ; Thomas and Hall 1997 ) , Akt ( Hemmings 1997 ) , PDK1 ( Chan et al . 1999 ) , mTOR ( Isotani et al . 1999 ) and PKC ( Laser et al . 1998 ) , which could mediate the identi W ed connections of FAK and p70S6K activation in vivo ( Baar et al . 2006 ; Baar and Esser 1999 ; Gan et al . 2006 ) . In this context we further tested di V erences in phos - phorylation of the serine / threonine - protein kinases Akt at T308 and S473 ( Fig . 5 ) , as wells as extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) at T204 ( results not shown ) , with - out being able to detect any changes neither in the FAK overexpression nor in the empty transfected muscles . These observations support the view that an activation of Fig . 3 Assembly showing FAK protein and tyrosine 397 phosphory - lation levels in mouse TA muscle in function of gene transfer and hind - limb un - and reloading . a Mean § SE of FAK signal relative to pCMV - empty transfected CC value in muscles from the di V erent load - ing interventions : white bars pCMV - empty plasmid in left TA muscle ; black bars pCMV - FAK plasmid in TA right muscle .

It seems that Akt and mTOR are resistive to mechanical stimuli in the fasted state ( Deldicque et al . 2008 ; Sandri 2008 ) . Rather , our results con W rm the transient downregulation of Akt activation state shortly after a mechanical stimulus ( Fig . 5b ; Deldicque et al . 2008 ) . The activation of p70S6K to mechanical stimulation in humans is also apparent when the activation status of Akt or mTOR is not altered ( Deldicque et al . 2008 ; Eliasson et al . 2006 ; Fujita et al . 2007 ; Terzis et al . 2008 ) . These observations and our results suggest that p70S6K activation by mechanical signals is Akt - independent . The observations recapitulate the reported role of p70S6K phosphorylation for protein synthesis in intact muscle . For instance , p70S6K phosphorylation on T421 and S424 has been shown to correlate with gains in muscle mass in di V erent animal models ( i . e . stretch and resistance exercise ) for muscle hypertrophy ( Baar and Esser 1999 ; Bodine et al . 2001 ; Reynolds et al . 2002 ; Spangenburg et al . 2008 ; Thomson and Gordon 2006 ) . The assessed sites control biochemical function of p70S6K and their enhanced phosphorylation is believed to stimulate protein synthesis in vitro ( Gingras et al . 2001 ; Kimball et al . 1998 ; Sale et al . 1999 ) . Phosphorylation of p70S6K on S411 and the tandem T421 / S424 relieves the phospho - transfer activity from autoinhibition prior to a full activation of the enzyme ( Pullen and Thomas 1997 ) . The correlation of phosphoryla - tion at the latter tandem sites in FAK - transfected muscles supports the notion of a functional implication of FAK - stimulated p70S6K activation in translation control in vivo . The W ndings also corroborate earlier suggestions on a role of FAK in protein synthesis ( Baar and Esser 1999 ; Kimball et al . 2004 ) and cell size regulation ( Ingber 2006 ) . Our present results now imply a functional contribution of FAK in modulating the load - induced hypertrophy response of muscle due to p70S6K - mediated induction of protein translation . They therefore expand the recently published summarizing scheme about signalling during muscle hyper - trophy ( Sandri 2008 ) .

Foremost this is presented by the reported damage response of transfected muscle portions by the selected methodology of gene transfer ( Durieux et al . 2002 , 2004 ; Gehl et al . 1999 ) . In our setting , this bias was controlled by comparing the net e V ect of transfection in contralateral muscle pairs between FAK - producing and empty expression plasmid . This paired design allowed the identi W cation of statistically signi W cant e V ects of FAK - transfection on p70S6K - signalling in trans - fected TA muscles which were mechano - modulated throughout time . This is considerable taking into account the incomplete percentage of muscle W bre transfection ( Durieux et al . 2002 , 2004 ) , the moderate responsiveness of TA muscle to hindlimb unloading compared to other leg muscle groups ( Carlson et al . 1999 ; Dapp et al . 2004 ) and the restrictions imposed by the relatively low number of animals per experimental group . This highlights the resolu - tion power of our approach for exposing muscle signalling . Speci W city of FAK - mediated mechano - signalling The measured control of FAK protein and tyrosine phos - phorylation levels in transfected muscles implies an impor - tant physiological modulation of FAK function by muscle loading . This regulation of Y397 phosphorylation and the amount of FAK between pCMV - FAK - and pCMV trans - fected muscle di V ered with regard to the “e V ective” time of loading . For instance , total level of Y397 phosphorylation was transiently enhanced by reloading without a change in FAK protein . In cage controls , no di V erence in Y397 phos - phorylation was , however , between FAK - transfected and empty - transfected TA muscle when total FAK protein lev - els were elevated . We suggest that the elevated FAK activa - tion within the W rst hours of reloading re X ects the possibly Fig . 5 E V ect of FAK overexpression on Akt phosphorylation on T308 ( a ) and S473 ( b ) .

Conclusion Our investigation on the mechano - biology of striated mus - cle identi W es FAK as an upstream element of the mechano - regulated pathway for activation of ribosomal S6 kinase . The disconnection of this pathway towards protein transla - tion from the commonly invoked Akt - mTOR signal has major bearing for control of muscle mass in physiological situations .
