Although the acute toxic effects of ammonia have been widely studied in ﬁ sh , the biochemical mechanisms of its toxicity have not been understood comprehensively . In this study , we performed comparative proteomic and metabolomic analysis between ammonia - challenged ( 1 . 2 and 2 . 6 mmol L − 1 NH 4 Cl for 96 h ) and control groups of marine medaka ( Oryzias melastigma ) to identify changes of the metabolite and protein pro ﬁ les in response to ammonia stress . The metabolic responses included changes of multiple amino acids , carbohydrates ( glucose and glycogen ) , energy metabolism products ( ATP and creatinine ) , and other metabolites ( choline and phosphocholine ) after ammonia exposure , indicating that ammonia mainly caused disturbance in energy metabolism and amino acids metabolism . The two - dimensional electrophoresis - based proteomic study identi ﬁ ed 23 altered proteins , which were involved in nervous system , locomotor system , cytoskeleton assembly , immune stress , oxidative stress , and signal transduction of apoptosis . These results suggested that ammonia not only induced oxidative stress , immune stress , cell injury and apoptosis but also affected the motor ability and central nervous system in marine medaka . It is the ﬁ rst time that metabolomic and proteomic approaches were integrated to elucidate ammonia toxicity in marine ﬁ shes . This study is of great value in better understanding the mechanisms of ammonia toxicity in marine ﬁ shes and in practical aspects of aquaculture . Keywords Proteomics ● Metabolomics ● Ammonia ● Marine medaka ● Immune stress ● Oxidative stress Introduction Ammonia refers to the sum of ammonia gas ( NH 3 ) and ammonium ion ( NH 4 + ) in water . It is both a well - known environmental toxicant for aquatic organisms and a primary nitrogenous waste produced by ammonotelic teleost . The environmental ammonia level is elevated by sewage ef ﬂ u - ents , industrial emissions , agricultural run - off , and decomposition of biological wastes in many waters , espe - cially in highly dense aquaculture systems ( Randall and Tsui 2002 ) where ammonia can be rapidly accumulated to hazardous or even lethal levels to ﬁ shes . Fishes have greater tolerance to ammonia than mammals due to their ammonotelic characteristics and their develop - ment of many different strategies to defend against ammo - nia toxicity . However , high environmental ammonia ( HEA ) still poses a problem for ﬁ shes since HEA can impair ammonia excretion or cause a net uptake of ammonia from the environment , which results in an elevation in body ammonia levels and leads to convulsions and death ( Randall and Tsui 2002 ) . It has been reported that ammonia induces toxicity in ﬁ shes including decreased growth rates , increased vulner - ability to disease , and histopathological changes in gill epithelia ( Dosdat et al . 2003 ; Banihashemi et al . 2015 ) . Recently , ammonia has also been found to exhibit effects on energy metabolism , generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) as well as apoptosis ( Kim et al . 2015 ; Li et al . 2016 ) . * Li Zhang zhangli @ scsio . ac . cn 1 Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio - Resources and Ecology , Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Applied Marine Biology , South China Sea Institute of Oceanology , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Guangzhou 510301 , China 2 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100049 , China Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article ( https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1007 / s10646 - 017 - 1892 - 2 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users . 1234567890 ( ) ; , : In spite of numerous studies investigating ammonia toxicity on the physiological level , the mechanisms of its biochemical toxicity , especially in marine ﬁ shes , have not been well addressed . Two theories have been proposed to address the problem in mammals which are glutamate excitotoxicity ( glutamatergic dysfunction following by the overactivation of N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) recep - tors ) and glutamine accumulation resulting in astrocyte swelling ( Rose 2002 ; Norenberg et al . 2005 ) . Mitochon - drial dysfunction induced by the oxidative stress has been reported to be the direct mechanism of ammonia neuro - toxicity ( Reddy et al . 2009 ) . But all have yet to be con - ﬁ rmed in ﬁ sh . One way to obtain an integrated view of responses of ﬁ shes to ammonia exposure is to employ the “ omic ” meth - ods : proteomics and metabolomics . Proteomics provides a complete analysis of all the expressed proteins in a parti - cular cell , tissue or the whole individual ( Anderson and Anderson 1998 ) . The interpretation of contaminant or stressors - induced toxicological effects and mechanisms could be realized with comparative pro ﬁ ling of proteins under contaminant - stressed and control conditions . The most widely used technique in proteomics is two - dimensional ( 2D ) electrophoresis ( Ji et al . 2013 ) . Metabo - lomics focuses on the small molecular products of meta - bolism ( < 1000 Da ) . Similarly , a comparison of metabolite pro ﬁ les can provide metabolic responses induced by exo - genous stressors such as heavy metal pollutants and organic pollutants ( Ji et al . 2013 ) . It is bene ﬁ cial to extend our understanding of the biological effects of stressors in organisms when proteomics and metabolomics are jointly taken into consideration , since both techniques may char - acterize the perturbation in metabolites and proteins involved in the same metabolic pathway , which may serve as molecular biomarkers of stressor exposure ( Liu et al . 2013 ) . The marine medaka ( O . melastigma ) , a marine coun - terpart of the freshwater Japanese medaka ( O . latipes ) , has been proposed as a marine model ﬁ sh in toxicological studies ( Padilla et al . 2009 ) . To the best of our knowledge , no studies have been reported to elucidate the toxicity characteristics induced by ammonia in any animals using either proteomic or metabolomic methods . Ours is the ﬁ rst study in which metabolomic and proteomic approaches were integrated to study ammonia toxicity in marine medaka . The metabolomic results highlighted the variation in amino acids and energy metabolic pathways , and the proteomic results implied several mechanisms of ammonia toxicity including motor disability , brain func - tion impairment , immune stress , oxidative stress and apoptosis . Materials and methods Marine medaka keeping and exposure All procedures were approved by the Animal Research Ethics Board of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and are in accordance with the Guidelines of the Chinese Council on Laboratory Animal Care . Marine medaka were propa - gated and maintained in our lab since 2012 . Marine medaka ( mean wt = 0 . 20 ± 0 . 01 g , sex undetermined ) were ran - domly assigned to three experimental groups : the control group , the low exposure group ( 1 . 2 mmol L − 1 NH 4 Cl ; Sigma - Aldrich , con ﬁ gured and stored as 4 M , pH 8 . 0 pre - servation liquor ) and the high exposure group ( 2 . 6 mmol L − 1 NH 4 Cl ) . Each treatment group included two glass tanks with 25 individuals . Exposures were carried out in glass tanks with 5 L seawater made with sea salt ( Landebao ) at a salinity of 30 ‰ at pH 8 . 0 at 25 °C for 96 h , and the exposure water was changed every 24 h during the exposure period . Before exposure and daily water change , the ammonia concentrations of seawater were monitored by the indophenol blue method to make sure the ﬁ nal exposure concentrations were correct . Before exposure , the selected ﬁ sh were acclimatized under the conditions as described above and fasted for 1 day . No mortality was found in the control and low exposure group , but 12 % of individuals were observed dead in the high NH 4 Cl treatment group . At the end of the experiments , ﬁ sh were sacri ﬁ ced and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen . For metabolomic analysis , 12 biological replicates were performed , in which 12 ﬁ sh were randomly selected from each exposure group with each ﬁ sh representing one sam - ple ; for proteomic analysis , 3 biological replicates were performed per exposure group , that is , a total of 9 ﬁ sh per exposure group were randomly selected with every 3 ﬁ sh pooled into one sample . Protein extraction , two - dimensional gel electrophoresis , in gel digestion and MS analysis In proteomic experiment , 3 biological replicates ( 3 samples ( n = 3 ) ) per exposure group were analyzed ; that is 3 2 - DE gels were performed per exposure group and each gel represent a sample of a pool of three ﬁ sh . A total of 9 independent 2 - DE gels were performed and compared ( Fig . 1 showed one sample gel of each exposure group as an example ) . Protein was extracted using Trizol reagent ( Invitrogen ) according to the methods of Wu et al . ( 2013 ) . The ﬁ rst dimension ( IEF ) was performed using Immobili - ne TM Drystrip ( 24 cm , pH 4 – 7 , linear ) ( GE Healthcare ) and conducted at 20 °C with an Ettan IPGphor3 system ( GE 268 L . Zhu et al . Healthcare ) . The second dimension was performed on 12 . 5 % SDS - PAGE gels using the Ettan DALTsix system ( GE Healthcare ) . Images were captured by ImageScanner TM III ( GE Healthcare ) and spots were quantitatively analyzed by using ImageMaster 2D Platinum 7 . 0 ( GE Healthcare ) with parameters of Smooth to 2 , Saliency to 150 and Min Area to 5 pixels . Only those spots with signi ﬁ cant changes ( more than 1 . 5 fold , p < 0 . 05 ) based on one - way ANOVA were considered to be differentially expressed protein and were further analyzed by an ABI 4800 MALDI - TOF / TOF Plus mass spectrometer ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , USA ) . The details of protocols are reported as Supple - mentary Information . Metabolite extraction , 1 H NMR spectroscopy , spectral pre - processing and pattern recognition analysis For metabolomic experiment , 12 1 H NMR spectroscopy of 12 samples per exposure group were performed ( n = 12 ) , and each sample was constituted by one ﬁ sh . A total of 36 1 H NMR spectroscopy were performed . Data were mean - centered before multivariate analysis . Polar metabolites were extracted using a methanol / water ( 1 / 1 ) solvent system ( Wu et al . 2008 ) and analyzed on a Bruker AV 500 NMR spectrometer . Multivariate statistical analysis was performed with the software SIMCA - P + ( V11 . 0 , Umetrics , Sweden ) . The details of protocols are reported as Supplementary Information . Results Proteins responses of marine medaka exposed to NH 4 Cl Comparative proteomics were used to determine the protein responses in O . melastigma exposed to 0 , 1 . 2 and 2 . 6 mmol L − 1 NH 4 Cl . A total of 23 protein spots signi ﬁ cantly altered in abundance ( > 1 . 5 folds , p < 0 . 05 ) were successfully identi - ﬁ ed by MAlDI - TOF - MS / MS . Figure 1 showed the dif - ferential protein spots which were successfully identi ﬁ ed in marine medaka with ammonia exposures . The details of identi ﬁ ed proteins are summarized in Table 1 . In the low concentration group , 20 signi ﬁ cantly differ - ential spots were discovered . These proteins were related to cytoskeleton and locomotor system ( myosin light chain ( 1 , 2 and 3 ) , keratin - 18 like , keratin K10 , actin alpha 1 ) , energy and primary metabolism ( cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5A - 2 , apolipoprotein A - I , nuclease diphosphate kinase B ( NDKB ) , U6 snRNA - associated Sm - like protein ( LSm3 ) and small ubiquitin - related modi ﬁ er 2 ( SUMO2 ) ) , signaling pathway ( cathepsin B - like and 14 - 3 - 3 protein beta / alpha - 1 - Fig . 1 Representative 2 - D images of proteins from O . melastigma that were exposed to three different concentrations of ammonia .

Metabolomic responses in marine medaka exposed to NH 4 Cl Figure 2 shows the representative 1 H NMR spectra of metabolites extracts from the control , low and high con - centration groups . O - PLS - DA was performed on the NMR spectral datasets to identify the metabolic biomarkers dif - ferentially expressed by two different concentrations of ammonia exposure ( Fig . 3 ) . In the low NH 4 Cl exposure group , the concentrations of glucose , creatinine , phos - phocholine and several amino acids ( alanine , arginine , glutamine , aspartate and asparagine ) were signi ﬁ cantly increased while the concentrations of choline and glycogen were decreased ( p < 0 . 05 ) . In the high NH 4 Cl exposure group , alanine , glutamine , aspartate , asparagines , and phosphocholine levels were signi ﬁ cantly increased and choline decreased as in the low concentration group . However , elevated acetate and ATP and decreased levels of leucine , glutamate , histidine , phenylalanine and inosine were uniquely detected in this group .

Figure 5 displayed the schematic presentation of an integrated hypothetical model of the mechanism of ammonia toxicity in the marine medaka . Discussion Ammonia is one of the major environmental pollutants in aquatic systems . An environmentally relevant concentration that occurs frequently in aquatic environments is 0 . 1 mmol L − 1 ammonia ( Linton et al . 1997 ) . But in aquaculture systems , especially in some recirculation systems , the concentration of ammonia increases directly with culture period , and might reach as high as 46 mg L − 1 ( Chen et al . 1988 ) . In our study , exposure concentrations of 1 . 2 and 2 . 6 mmol L − 1 NH 4 Cl were chosen , which were reported to be the 60 d and 96 h LC 50 for ammonia exposed marine medaka ( Gao et al . 2017 ) . According to the method of Bower and Bidwell ( 1978 ) , the concentrations of the unionized form of ammonia under our condition ( 30 ‰ salinity , pH 8 . 0 and 25 °C ) is 0 . 054 and 0 . 122 mmol L − 1 ammonia exposure groups , respectively .

In the present study , the proteomic results showed that three proteins relative to the function of nervous system were down - regulated signi ﬁ cantly in marine medaka after acute ammonia exposure , which suggested that ammonia exerted effects on its central nervous system . SNAP - 25 is a presynaptic plasma membrane protein and plays a pivotal role in regulating the exocytosis of neuro - transmitters ( Sollner et al . 1993 ) . It has been reported that the over - expression of SNAP - 25 inhibited glutamate release from the presynaptic neuron while the down - regulation enhanced the release ( Owe - Larsson et al . 1999 ; Yang et al . 2000 ) . In the present study , SNAP - 25 was found to be down - regulated , which indicated the increased extracellular release of glutamate and additional activation of NMDA type glutamate receptors . C1QL4 plays a role in regulation of synapse formation and maintenance ( Bolliger et al . 2011 ) . In the present study , down - regulated C1QL4 indicated that exposure affected neuronal morphology of ﬁ shes . Mori et al . ( 2010 ) have reported that pharmacological inhibition of S100B , a well - known biomarker of brain damage in clinical settings , could mitigate hallmark pathologies of brain disease . Thus , the down - regulation of S100B after ammonia exposure might act as one of the safeguarding strategies to help marine medaka relieve the brain lesions induced by ammonia exposure . In addition , metabolomic results provided strong support for the likely impairment of the central nervous system after ammonia exposure ( see section “ Disorder in amino acid metabolism ” ) .

The color map shows the signi ﬁ cance of metabolite variations between the two classes ( control and NH 4 Cl exposure ) .

Zhu et al . Impact on the locomotor system It has been reported that hyperammoniemia can affect ﬁ sh swimming performance with unknown mechanisms ( Ran - dall and Tsui 2002 ) . Our results suggested that it may be due to the direct damage to muscle tissue by ammonia toxicity . Proteomic results suggested that ammonia exposure could affect muscle contractile apparatus in marine medaka . First , three types of myosin light chain ( myosin light chain 1 , 2 , 3 ) constituting the thick myo ﬁ lament were sig - ni ﬁ cantly down - regulated ( especially myosin light chain - 2 and myosin light chain - 3 by 4 . 5 and 3 . 2 folds , respectively ) . Second , skeletal muscle isoform protein actin alpha 1 , involved in the thin myo ﬁ laments of contractile apparatus ( Vartiainen et al . 2002 ) , was also reduced after ammonia exposure . Disorder in amino acid metabolism Increased levels of glutamine is the most typical biochem - ical phenomenon in organisms exposed to high environ - mental ammonia ( Zhang et al . 2013 ) and altered ratios of glutamine / glutamate have been suggested to be speci ﬁ c and sensitive indicators of ammonia pollution ( Arillo et al . 1981 ) . Our results in marine medaka were similar in that the ratio of glutamine / glutamate was de ﬁ nitely higher in both ammonia treatment groups since the levels of glutamine were markedly elevated in both groups while that of glu - tamate decreased in the high ammonia treated group .

Excessive accumulation of gluta - mine in brain has been proposed to be a detoxi ﬁ cation mechanism ( Randall and Tsui 2002 ; Sanderson et al . 2010 ) , but it still presents a problem ( Albrecht et al . 2010 ) . Many studies suggest that glutamine may transport excess ammonia from cytoplasm into mitochondria and hence interfere with mitochondrial function via excessive pro - duction of free radicals and induction of mitochondrial permeability transition ( MPT ) , two phenomena known to bring about astrocyte dysfunction and cell swelling ( Albrecht et al . 2010 ) . Glutamate is neurotoxic in the central nervous system by stimulating NMDA receptors . It has been reported that despite glutamate being reduced , ammonia toxicity was still mediated , at least partially , by an over - activation of NMDA receptors induced by the high levels of brain extracellular glutamate ( Görg et al . 2010 ; Marcaida et al . 1992 ) due to release from presynaptic membranes or the decreasing glutamate synaptic reuptake ( Schimdt et al . 1993 ) . As mentioned earlier , SNAP - 25 , a protein inhibiting glutamate release into extracellular matrix , was found to be down - regulated in the ammonia exposed marine medaka . Other altered amino acids after ammonia exposure can be differentiated into two groups , the increased non - essential amino acids ( alanine , arginine , aspartate and asparagine ) and the decreased essential amino acids ( leucine , histidine and phenylalanine ) ( Fig . 4 ) . Glutamine and glutamate can transfer their amines to produce alanine and aspartate directly or arginine and asparagine indirectly . By that mechanism , the free toxic ammonia can be ﬁ xed in the amino acid . Thus , these elevated non - essential ammonia acids were results of a protection strategy against ammonia toxicity ( Sinha et al . 2013 ) . Considering the fasting during ammonia exposure , the decreases of essential amino acids were most likely due to enhanced consumption of them . For example , histidine may act as material supplementary of histamine ( Fig . 4 ) , an active neurotransmitter that has been reported to be quantitatively released from striated muscle in a solution of ammonium chloride ( Schild 1949 ) . Leucine can be quickly used to pro - duce the ATP for the need of muscle ( Albrecht 2007 ) , which could help endure the bioenergetic failure caused by ammonia exposure in marine medaka ( section “ The bioenergetic fail - ure ” ) . The decrease of leucine could also be introduced by down - regulated muscle protein of the contractile apparatus ( Fig . 5 ; Table 1 ) in light of its stimulation role in muscle protein expression ( Crozier et al . 2005 ) . The bioenergetic failure In the present study , a signi ﬁ cant decrease in glycogen and an elevation of its substrates glucose and ATP suggested enhanced glycogen hydrolysis and oxygenolysis in ammo - nia exposure groups ( Fig . 4 ) . The signi ﬁ cant increase of creatinine indicated that the creatine phosphate pathway ( Saks 2007 ) was induced to produce more ATP ( Fig . 4 ) . All these metabolic biomarkers found in our study suggested that ammonia exposed marine medaka underwent a period of surging energy consumption . This observation of high energy consumption is consistent with previous studies in ﬁ shes and has already been con ﬁ rmed in mammals ( Albrecht 2003 ; Dosdat et al . 2003 ; Gao et al . 2017 ) , in which neuronal hyperexcitability and disturbance of the TCA cycle have been proposed to explain the high demand of energy of organisms under ammonia toxicity ( Zhang et al . 2011 ) . The disturbances of energy metabolism found by the metabolomics were also supported by our proteomic results . Nuclease diphosphate kinase B ( NDKB ) plays an important role in the regulation of cellular nucleoside triphosphate concentrations ( Postel and Abramczyk 2003 ) . Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5A - 2 is a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase that lies in the respiratory electron transport chain of mitochondria for ATP synthesis ( Michel 1998 ) . Both were found to be down - regulated in ammonia exposed medaka by comparative proteomics , which supported the occurrence of a disturbance in energy production . Immune stress and oxidative stress We found alterations in multiple immune related proteins , which suggested that ammonia exposure induced immune stress in marine medaka . Complement factor H ( CFH ) is known to minimize the damage mediated by pathogens or other hazardous material ( Collard et al . 1999 ) . Apolipo - protein A1 plays an important role in host defense mainly by binding endotoxin and other bacterial products to neu - tralize their toxic effects ( Grunfeld and Feingold 2008 ) . Astacin metalloprotease was reported to be involved in pathological states such as in ﬂ ammation ( Semenova and Rudenskaya 2008 ) . Cathepsin B was also reported to play a role in innate immune responses and in ﬂ ammation ( Conus and Simon 2010 ) . Wap65 is a molecule similar to the mammalian hemopexin and has an important role in the in ﬂ ammatory response ( Cho et al . 2012 ) . The signi ﬁ cant up - regulation of all above proteins suggested that ammonia - exposure induced the immune stress in marine medaka . It has been reported that the immune stress induced by ammonia has been found in many other aquatic organism ( Cheng et al . 2015 ; Kim et al . 2015 ; Li et al . 2016 ) . Although the relative mechanisms are still unclear , the changed protein pro ﬁ le here may provide possible expla - nations for the immune stress and reaction induced by ammonia toxicity . 274 L . Zhu et al . In addition , the proteomic results also suggested that ammonia exposure resulted in oxidative stress in marine medaka ( Fig . 5 ) , which is consistent with earlier studies of oxidative stress induced by ammonia in other ﬁ shes and mammals ( Dosdat et al . 2003 ; Kim et al . 2015 ; Li et al . 2016 ) . Besides the immune role , the up - regulation of CFH was also reported to be associated with increased oxidative stress ( Collard et al . 1999 ) . SH3 domain - binding glutamic acid - rich - like protein - like ( SH3BGRL ) belongs to the thioredoxin - like protein superfamily involving in the reduction of ROS ( Mazzocco et al . 2002 ) . It has been reported that the suppression of SH3BGRL could facilitate gene transcription mediated by NF - kB ( Majid et al . 2006 ) , a critical factor causing astrocyte swelling and brain edema with elevated brain ammonia level in mammals ( Jayakumar et al . 2011 ) . Therefore , the decrease of SH3BGRL in the low NH 4 Cl exposure group implied that ammonia induced ROS may lead to cell apoptosis in marine medaka . In addition , the down - regulation of NDKB and a subunit of cytochrome c identi ﬁ ed by the present proteomic results as well as severe energy consumption , indicated by the metabolomic results were evidence of oxidative stress in mitochondria of ammonia exposed marine medaka . Cytoskeleton system It has been demonstrated by many ecotoxicological studies that cytoskeleton proteins are one of the main targets for some xenobiotics or toxins , which are probably induced by the increased cellular ROS stress ( Karim et al . 2011 ) . In our study , four proteins involved in cytoskeletons were altered after ammonia exposure ( Fig . 5 ) . Keratins are important intermediate ﬁ lament proteins that make up the cytoskele - tons of vertebrate epithelial cells ( Wang et al . 2011 ) . Here , two kinds of keratin ( keratin K18 - like and keratin K10 ) were found to be changed signi ﬁ cantly after ammonia exposure . This alteration of keratins may be attributable to indirect in ﬂ uence of cellular stress from ammonia exposure ( Wang et al . 2011 ) or the direct role of ammonia acting as a strong reducing agent to break the disul ﬁ de bond between the keratin ﬁ laments ( Higuchi et al . 2009 ) . In addition , two peptidases ( elastase - 1 and astacin metalloprotease precursor ) involved in the hydrolysis of extracellular matrix ( Semenova and Rudenskaya 2008 ) were found to be up - regulated after ammonia exposure , which indicated the degradation of extracellular matrix and instability of the cytoskeleton . Signaling pathway of apoptosis The level of 14 - 3 - 3 beta / alpha - 1 - like protein was sig - ni ﬁ cantly reduced in the ammonia exposed ﬁ sh , which indicated that ammonia exposure may cause apoptosis ( Fig . 5 ) . Proteins of the 14 - 3 - 3 family were found to be down - regulated by some xenobiotics ( Anderson and Anderson 1998 ; Liu et al . 2013 ; Karim et al . 2011 ) . They can bind the phosphorylated BAD ( Bcl - 2 - associated death promoter ) protein and so prevent apoptosis ( Muslin et al . 1996 ) . They also play a role in regulating mitochondrial and chloroplast ATP synthase ( Bunney et al . 2001 ) . Hence , their down - regulation also supported the likely disturbance in energy metabolism induced by ammonia toxicity ( Fig . 5 ) . It has been reported that cathepsin B and serine / cysteine protease inhibitors are co - expressed in protease - mediated cell death . Both proteins were found to be changed signi ﬁ cantly in the present study . Cathepsin B , a serine / cysteine protease , has been demonstrated to conduct signal transduction involved in the apoptotic process mediated by oxidative stress or by various tumors ( Bien et al . 2010 ; Lee et al . 2009 ) . And the serine / cysteine protease inhibitors can prevent the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis ( Lee et al . 2009 ) . Thereby , the up - regulation of cathepsin B - like protein and the down - regulation of serine / cysteine protease inhibitor in the present study implied that apoptosis was triggered by oxidative stress in ammonia exposed marine medaka . Conclusions Our study is the ﬁ rst in which comparative metabolomic and proteomic approaches were integrated to elucidate ammonia toxicity in marine ﬁ sh . The metabolomic and proteomic results were complementary to our conclusion that acute ammonia toxicity in marine medaka generally caused disturbance of amino acids and energy metabolism , caused immune stress , oxidative stress as well as cell apoptosis and impaired central nervous system and motor ability . These overall results highlighted the complexity and diversity of ammonia toxicity . Our study provided new insights into ammonia toxicity in a marine teleost at the protein and metabolite levels .
