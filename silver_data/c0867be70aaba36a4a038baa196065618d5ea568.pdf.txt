The best inhibitor , N - benzyl - p - toluene sulphonamide ( BTS ) , an aryl sulphonamide , inhib - ited the Ca 2 + - stimulated S1 ATPase , and reversibly blocked gliding motility . Although BTS does not compete for the nucleotide - binding site of myosin , it weakens myosin’s interaction with F - actin . BTS reversibly sup - pressed force production in skinned skeletal muscle fibres from rabbit and frog skin at micromolar concentra - tions . BTS suppressed twitch production of intact frog fibres with minimum alteration of Ca 2 + metabolism . BTS is remarkably specific , as it was much less effective in sup - pressing contraction in rat myocardial or rabbit slow - twitch muscle , and did not inhibit platelet myosin II . The isolation of BTS and the recently discovered Eg5 kinesin inhibitor , monastrol 1 , suggests that motor proteins may be potential targets for therapeutic applications . S mall molecules that can enter cells and perturb the function of a specific target protein are useful tools in basic cell biology research and as leads for developing therapeutic agents . Natural - product toxins that target actin and tubulin with high affinity and specificity are key tools in cytoskeleton research . However , we currently lack small - molecule tools for most other cytoskeletal proteins 2 – 5 . Here we report a search for small - molecule inhibitors of myosin II , a motor protein involved in muscle contraction and many cellu - lar processes , including cytokinesis and cell migration 6 . Previously described myosin inhibitors suffer from either questionable speci - ficity or a lack of cell permeability 7 – 10 . The low affinity reagent 2 , 3 - butane dione monoxime ( BDM ) targets muscle myosin II ( ref . 11 ) , but it can also affect Ca 2 + regulation 12 , 13 , and we have found that it does not inhibit nonmuscle myosin II ( A . F . S . , A . C . and T . J . M . , unpublished observation ) . The cytoskeleton and cell - motility fields would benefit considerably from cell - permeable , specific , small - molecule inhibitors of myosin II isoforms with biochemically defined modes of action . We screened a small - molecule library and identified a specific inhibitor of rabbit muscle myosin subfragment 1 ( S1 ) actin - stimu - lated ATPase activity . Extrapolating from the myosin inhibitor reported here , and the Eg5 kinesin inhibitor monastrol 1 , we sur - mise that motor proteins in general may be excellent potential tar - gets for small molecules . We set up a high - throughput luminescence assay to measure actin - activated ATPase activity ( Fig . 1a , b ) . S1 from rabbit muscle was mixed with polymerized actin and distributed into wells of assay plates without nucleotides . Compounds from a chemical library were transferred into the wells with a pin array . The reaction was initiated with MgATP . Assay plates were incubated until > 95 % of the added ATP in control wells was hydrolysed . The remaining ATP was determined by distributing a solution containing luciferin and luciferase into the wells and measuring the luminescence signal . We screened 16 , 300 compounds from a commercial chemical library ( Diverset E ; Chembridge Inc . ) , and found four compounds from two structural classes ( aryl sulphonamides ( 1 , 2 ) and hydroxycoumarins ( 4 , 5 ) ; Fig . 1c ) that reproducibly and strongly inhibited the myosin S1 ATPase activity . We focused on the aryl sulphonamides because they were more potent and easier to synthesize . We prepared a mini - library of 240 aryl sulphonamides related to ( and containing ) the two best hits from our library screen , and tested them in the myosin ATPase assay ( Fig . S1 in Supplementary Information ) . The hits from this mini - library clustered tightly around the original library hits , and none of the new compounds were significantly more potent than the compound originally found ( Fig . S1 , position 3H ) . The systematic name for 3H is N - benzyl - p - toluenesulphonamide ( BTS ) , and it is commercially available ( Sigma - Aldrich Rare Chemicals , catalogue number S949760 ) . By running our standard luminescence assay with dilu - tions of BTS , we determined an IC 50 for the actin - activated ATPase of ~ 5 µ M ( data not shown ) . Our mini - library identified a useful negative control compound ( 3 in Fig . 1c and position 5C in Fig . S1 ) . 5C is an isomer of BTS that had no detectable activity in the luminescence assay at 300 µ M . To test whether BTS targets myosin or actin , we measured its effect on the myosin S1 Ca 2 + - stimulated ATPase in the absence of actin ( Fig . 2a ) . BTS inhibited this ATPase activity with an IC 50 of ~ 5 µ M , which is similar to its IC 50 for inhibition of actin - stimulat - ed myosin S1 ATPase activity . BTS must , therefore , bind to , and inhibit , skeletal myosin S1 . To test whether BTS inhibits the motor activity of skeletal muscle myosin , we performed a gliding - filament assay using heavy meromyosin ( HMM ) . At 2 µ M BTS , sliding velocity was more than halved compared with untreated control ( control 2 . 89 ± 0 . 07 µ m s − 1 , BTS 1 . 33 ± 0 . 11 µ m s − 1 ) , and reduced to 3 . 5 % of the control at 20 µ M ( 0 . 10 ± 0 . 04 µ m s − 1 ) . The control compound , 5C , had no effect at 20 µ M ( 2 . 69 ± 0 . 04 µ m s − 1 ) . After BTS was washed out of the chamber , gliding motility resumed at the pre - inhibition rate . BTS therefore blocks the motor activity of myosin at a concentration in the same range as its IC 50 in the solu - tion ATPase assays ; this inhibition is rapidly reversible . We next probed the mechanism by which BTS inhibits myosin . To determine if BTS competes for the nucleotide - binding site , we performed a competition binding assay between ADP and a fluo - rescent ADP derivative , 3 ′ - O - ( N - methylanthraniloyl ) - ADP ( Mant - ADP ; Fig . 2b ) 14 . Adding increasing concentrations of ADP reduced the fluorescence of Mant - ADP , indicating competition between the two nucleotides . In contrast , adding BTS in large excess over its IC 50 did not decrease the fluorescence . These data imply that Mant - ADP © 2003 Nature PublishingGroup brief communications NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 4 JANUARY 2002 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 84 can bind to myosin in the presence of concentrations of BTS that are saturating in the ATPase inhibition assays , indicating that nucleotides and BTS bind to different sites . To determine the effect of BTS on F - actin binding by myosin , we used rabbit skeletal muscle HMM in a sedimentation assay ( Fig . 2c ) . In a solution lacking nucleotide , all the full - length HMM cosedimented with F - actin in the absence or presence of 100 µ M BTS . The sensitivity of this assay may not , however , be sufficient to detect a change in the strong affinity of nucleotide - free myosin for F - actin . When 1 mM ATP was added , very little HMM cosediment - ed with actin whether or not BTS was present . In the presence of 1 mM ADP without BTS , most of the HMM cosedimented with actin . The addition of BTS to the actomyosin ADP mixture dissoci - ated the HMM . BTS therefore inhibits binding of actin by myosin – ADP . Consistent with these observations , kinetic studies show that , in the presence of BTS , the affinity of ADP – S1 for actin is decreased , the maximum actin - activated ATPase rate is reduced , and the actin concentration for half maximal activation of the ATPase activity is increased ( M . A . Shaw , E . M . Ostap and Y . E . Goldman , personal communication ) . To test the effect of BTS on the fully assembled myofilament array , we examined the contractile properties of skinned muscle fibre preparations ( Fig . 3a – c ) . In glycerol - extracted fibres from rabbit psoas muscle , BTS inhibited isometric Ca 2 + - activated tension with an IC 50 of ~ 3 µ M ( Fig . 3a ) . At 100 µ M BTS , tension decreased 13579111315171921 A E I M 012345678910 Lu m i ne sc en c e s i gna l ( c oun t s x 10 5 s – 1 ) Column Row Sulphonamides S NH O O S NH O O O O 2 N S NH O O Hydroxycoumarins O OH O N O OH O N O 2 N Actin + myosin Pin transfer of compounds Allow ATP hydrolysis by myosin Luciferase + luciferin Read luminescencesignal ATP b a c 1 , BTS 3 , negative control 2 4 5 Figure 1 Screen for inhibitors of myosin II . a , A schematic of the luciferase - based assay for chemical inhibition of skeletal myosin S1 ATPase . b , Screening data from compound plate 47 shows two potential inhibitors of myosin ATPase .

The 5C isomer of BTS suppressed ten - sion by only 15 % at 500 µ M . Unloaded shortening velocity of rabbit fibres was determined by applying large ( 4 – 10 % ) length releases to slacken a fibre ( Fig . 3b , c ) and measuring the time required to take up this slack 15 . The slopes of the lines fitted to the amplitude of shortening versus slack times give the shortening velocity . Although 10 µ M BTS suppressed iso - metric tension by ~ 82 % , unloaded shortening ( triangles in Fig . 3c ) was suppressed by only ~ 19 % of that in the absence of BTS ( cir - cles ) . At partial tension suppression by BTS , some cross - bridges attach to the thin filament producing translocation at the normal rate .

The upper panel shows transient calcium concentration changes and the lower panel simultaneous twitch tension responses from four successive measurements . The numbers next to the tension traces indicate the time , in minutes , that the fibre was exposed to BTS . The peak twitch tension remaining after 55 min ( data not shown ) was 4 . 6 % of that observed initially . After re - exposure of the fibre to Ringers without BTS , the tension response showed partial recovery . The most likely explanation why full recovery was not observed is that BTS bound to the lucite walls of the cham - ber preventing full washout . © 2003 Nature PublishingGroup brief communications NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 4 JANUARY 2002 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 86 attachments in the presence of BTS . In fact BTS decreased rigour tension and stiffness even in the absence of ATP and removal of the BTS led to partial recovery of rigour tension ( data not shown ) . As the BTS concentration was raised , stiffness , tested by appli - cation of quick length changes in active contraction 16 , declined approximately in proportion to the steady tension ( IC 50 = 7 µ M ) . The recovery transients initiated by the quick steps were qualita - tively similar to those in the absence of BTS . These results indicate that BTS reduces the number of attached myosin heads without markedly altering the kinetic properties of the remaining attach - ments . For the rabbit fibres , the suppression of tension and stiff - ness was rapidly reversible ( < 5 min ) if the fibre was washed in a BTS - free relaxing solution . In mechanically skinned frog semitendinosus fibres , BTS also suppressed isometric Ca 2 + - activated tension ( IC 50 = 1 µ M , Fig . 4 ) , but in glycerol - extracted soleus fibres of rabbit and chemically skinned trabeculae and papillary muscle from rat hearts BTS was much less effective ( IC 50 = 320 µ M ; Fig . 4b ) . Tension suppression in the myocardial and soleus preparations was prompt ( wash in and wash out < 4 min ) , but the frog skinned fibres reacted much more slowly . Full suppression occurred in > 25 min and full recov - ery required multiple contractions or long contraction times . The selectivity of BTS for fast skeletal versus slow or cardiac muscle prompted further biochemical tests of specificity . BTS at 100 µ M did not inhibit gliding motility of kinesin , or the nucleotide - binding enzymes , pyruvate kinase , lactate dehydroge - nase and firefly luciferase . To test specificity between myosins , we prepared human platelet myosin II and its activator , myosin light chain kinase , and assayed the actin - stimulated ATPase activity of this myosin . Remarkably , 100 µ M BTS did not inhibit platelet myosin II ( data not shown ) . To test whether BTS would permeate the membrane of an intact cellular preparation and specifically inhibit contraction , intact , live single fibres from frog twitch muscle were equilibrated in standard Ringers solution at 16 ° C , injected with a fluorescent Ca 2 + indicator , and electrically stimulated to produce twitches ( Fig . 3 ) . BTS ( 5 µ M ) suppressed twitch contraction by 97 % after ~ 60 min of incubation without affecting the calcium transient . Twitch force was inhibited 50 % by 0 . 14 µ M BTS ( Fig . 4a ) . At ≥ 100 µ M BTS , the refractory period for repetitive stimulation was lengthened , indicating action potential prolongation . At 5 µ M BTS , the half - time of twitch tension suppression was 5 – 10 min . This onset is probably not limited by diffusion through the sur - face membrane because skinned frog fibres also reacted to BTS slowly . Curves of tension inhibition for the five fibre types by BTS and , for psoas muscle the 5C isomer , are shown in Fig . 4 . The substituted aromatic structures and relatively modest IC 50 values of our myosin inhibitors resemble the lead compounds that often form the starting point for therapeutic drug develop - ment . To test the feasibility of compound optimization with lim - ited resources , we used parallel synthesis to make a small library related to our sulphonamide hits . None of the new compounds was more potent than BTS , showing that the steric requirements for binding of BTS to myosin II are quite strict . BTS inhibits rab - bit fast muscle myosin II at least 100 × more potently than human nonmuscle , rabbit slow muscle and rat cardiac muscle myosin II . These myosins have greater than 50 % sequence identity in their motor domains , very similar folds , and very similar biochemical mechanisms 17 , 18 . Thus , BTS acts with remarkable specificity con - sistent with the restricted steric requirements for binding to the fast muscle myosin . BTS binding weakens the affinity of myosin for actin , leading to dissociation of myosin in the presence of ADP . BTS might bind at the nucleotide - binding site , but our competition binding data with Mant - ADP argue against this . BTS might compete directly with actin at the actin - binding site or might bind to a third site on myosin II and allosterically weaken actin binding . Our current data do not distinguish between these possibilities . We favour the allosteric model because BTS seems too small to compete directly with actin , and inhibition of the Ca 2 + - stimulated myosin ATPase is actin - independent . The experiments on muscle fibre preparations support the conclusion that BTS weakens actomyosin affinity . A few percent of rigour cross - bridges would markedly slow down maximum shortening velocity ; but BTS suppressed isometric force much more strongly than active sliding velocity ( Fig . 3b , c ) . During iso - metric force suppression by BTS , the tension transients initiated by quick length changes were relatively normal . Furthermore , BTS directly caused detachment of rigour cross - bridges . Thus BTS acts to inhibit myosin head attachment to actin but those heads that remain uninhibited at moderate BTS concentrations have normal kinetics . Soleus and cardiac muscle express the slow ( β ) isoform of myosin II , and these muscle types were much less sensitive to BTS than fast muscle fibres from rabbit or frog ( Fig . 4 ) .

The following equation T BTS = T 0 ( K i / ( [ BTS ] + K i ) ) was used to fit data from each fibre type . a illustrates the high affinity of fast skeletal muscle for BTS compared to soleus and cardiac mus - cle preparations .

In b , data for cardiac and soleus preparations , including higher concentrations are plotted .

In the intact frog sin - gle fibres , the suppression of twitch tension at concentrations ( < 5 µ M ) that caused little alteration of the ‘calcium transient’ ( Fig . 3c ) indicates that BTS is membrane permeable and specific for the con - tractile apparatus . There are several practical applications for BTS in studying skeletal myosin . BTS might help in dissecting the detailed mecha - nism by which ATP hydrolysis powers force production — we envisage that using BTS will facilitate structural analysis of an intermediate in the myosin enzymatic cycle not otherwise accessi - ble . An agent that prevents muscle contraction by specifically tar - geting myosin II will also be useful to muscle physiologists . Finally , muscle relaxants have multiple medical uses 19 , and no current drug targets specific myosins . We now have two examples of small molecules that specifical - ly target motor proteins , BTS and the Eg5 inhibitor monastrol 1 . We conclude that motors are accessible drug targets , which could have significant implications for both basic cell biology research and therapeutics . Motors function in most cells and are involved in tissue - specific physiology 20 , 21 . Specific small - molecule inhibitors will be key tools for analysing the function of these motors . Motors for which loss of function has therapeutic benefit are promising drug targets . To achieve our goal of finding small - molecule tools for cytokinesis and cell motility research , we are now screening small - molecule libraries for inhibitors of nonmus - cle myosin II . Methods Protein purification Myosin was purified from fresh rabbit skeletal muscle according to Margossian and Lowey 22 . The S1 fragment of myosin was generated by papain ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) digestion as described previ - ously 22 followed by ion - exchange chromatography on Q - sepharose ( Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ) . HMM was made by digesting myosin with chymotrypsin 22 and further purified by ion - exchange chromatography on DEAE - sephadex . Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle as previously reported 23 and polymerized to F - actin in 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM ATP . High - throughput screening of chemical libraries Five microlitres of a mixture of 0 . 1 mg ml − 1 myosin S1 , 0 . 4 mg / ml F - actin , 1 mM DTT in assay buffer ( 25 mM HEPES pH 7 . 6 , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 ) was dispensed into a 384 - well white clini - plate ( Greiner Labortechnik , Frickenhausen , Germany ) . Chemical compounds stored in DMSO at a concentration of 5 mg ml – 1 were transferred into 384 - well plates using a steel pin array mounted on an X , Y , Z robot to give a final concentration of ~ 100 µ M . The reaction was initiated by adding 5 µ l per well of 200 µ M ATP then incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature ( 20 – 24 ° C ) . To measure the remaining ATP , 40 µ l of development solution ( 0 . 5 mM luciferin , 1 . 25 µ g ml − 1 luciferase , 25 mM Tricine pH 7 . 8 , 5 mM MgSO 4 , 100 µ M EDTA and 1 mM DTT ; Molecular Probes , Eugene , Oregon ) was added to each well . The luminescence signal in each assay well was then measured using a plate reader ( PerkinElmer , Shelton , CT ) within 15 min . Construction of the sulphonamide mini - library To a stirred solution of 100 µ moles of each sulphonyl chloride ( Fig . S1 ) dissolved in 0 . 5 ml of dichloromethane , 0 . 5 ml of a mixture of 115 µ moles of each amine ( Fig . S1 ) and 115 µ moles of diisopropylethylamine in dichloromethane was added . The reaction mixtures were stirred for 2 h at room temperature . To terminate the reaction , ~ 0 . 1 g of aminomethyl polystyrene resin ( Sigma ) fol - lowed by 0 . 1 g of amberlyst resin was added to each mixture and incubated for 10 min . Reaction mixtures were then filtered and dried . Thin - layer chromatography was used to verify the reaction and reverse phase HPLC ( C - 18 ) and mass spectrometry were performed on random samples for confirmation . Each compound was resuspended in DMSO to a final concentration of ~ 20 mg ml − 1 . For activity testing , the compounds were distributed into 384 - well plates at 5 mg ml − 1 in DMSO . In vitro motility Actin filament sliding on myosin S1 and on HMM was assayed according to Sellers et al . 24 with the following modifications . HMM was adsorbed to nitrocellulose - coated coverslips in flow - cell cham - bers at a concentration of 0 . 1 mg ml − 1 . Chambers were blocked with 0 . 5 mg ml − 1 casein , and then F - actin that had been stabilized with TRITC - phalloidin was added at a concentration of 20 nM . Motility was initiated by adding 1 mM ATP in assay buffer ( 20 mM KCl , 10 mM MOPS pH 7 . 2 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM DTT , 2 . 5 mg ml − 1 glucose , 0 . 1 mg ml − 1 glucose oxidase , 0 . 02 mg ml − 1 catalase ) and filament sliding was recorded at 10s intervals using a 1 . 4NA 60 × lens ( Nikon ) and a cooled charge - coupled display ( CCD ) camera ( Princeton Instruments ) . For control , 5C , 20 µ M BTS and 2 µ M BTS the number of filaments tracked were 63 , 27 , 51 and 54 respectively in 8 , 3 , 6 and 5 individual experiments . Rates are expressed as velocity in µ m sec − 1 ± standard error . Measurement of Ca 2 + - stimulated S1 ATPase Myosin S1 was diluted to 0 . 025 mg ml - 1 in reaction buffer ( 200 mM KCl , 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 2 . 5 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM 2 - amino - 6 - mercapto - 7methyl - purine riboside ( MESG ) and 10 U ml - 1 purine nucleoside phosphorylase ( PNP ) ( Molecular Probes ) ) . The reaction was initiated by adding ATP to 100 µ M and absorbance at 360 nm was read every 5 s . Inhibition was assayed at 0 , 0 . 625 , 1 . 25 , 2 . 5 , 5 and 10 µ M BTS . Mant - ADP binding assay 0 . 5 µ M myosin S1 was mixed with 5 µ M Mant - ADP ( Molecular Probes ) in assay buffer ( 25 mM HEPES pH 7 . 6 , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 ) . Solutions of ADP , BTS and 5 % DMSO , or 5 % DMSO were added to the mixture of myosin S1 and Mant - ADP to give final ADP or BTS concentrations of 5 , 10 , 50 , 100 , 200 or 400 µ M . Mant - ADP fluorescence was excited at 290 nm and assayed at 448 nm . Fluorescence values in the presence of ADP or BTS were divided by the fluorescence of the buffer control to correct for dilution effects . Cosedimentation of F - actin and HMM G - actin ( 35 µM ) was polymerized in F - buffer ( 100 mM KCl , 25 mM Tris pH 7 . 0 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 1 mM ATP ) for 45 min at 37 ° C . F - actin was stabilized by adding phal - loidin to 45 µM and was dialysed against spindown buffer ( 200 mM KCl , 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 0 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 50 mM glucose ) to remove residual ATP . HMM ( 0 . 5 µ M ) was incubated with or without F - actin ( 1 . 5 µ M ) in binding buffer for 15 min at room temperature , then 10 µ l of the mix - ture was distributed into separate tubes . ADP ( 50 mM ) was preincubated with 50 U ml − 1 hexokinase ( Sigma ) in spindown buffer for 20 min at 37 ° C to hydrolyse contaminant ATP . To the actin – myosin mixture , an equal volume of binding buffer alone or binding buffer containing either 2 mM ATP or 2 mM ADP and 0 . 2 U hexokinase was added . BTS dissolved in DMSO or DMSO alone was added at the time of nucleotide addition to yield a final concentration of 100 µ M BTS or 0 . 1 % DMSO . The reaction mixture was incubated at 22 ° C for 10 min then centrifuged at 217000 g ( 75000 rpm ) for 10 min in a TLA - 100 rotor ( Beckman ) . The supernatants and pellets were solubilized in SDS – PAGE sample buffer , separated on a 10 % SDS – PAGE gel and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue . Fibre preparation Relaxed bundles of rabbit psoas or soleus muscle were chemically skinned in a 50 % glycerol - extrac - tion solution ( 5 mM MgATP , < 10 − 8 M Ca 2 + , − 20 ° C ) 25 to remove the sarcolemma , leaving the contrac - tile apparatus intact . Single fibres were teased from the bundles under silicone oil ( 12 ° C ) and rinsed with glycerol - free relaxing solution . Aluminum foil clips ( T - clips ) were fastened around the ends of the fibres to secure the fibre between hooks on a force transducer and a servomotor ( 200 µ s length changes ) 26 . Strips of rat cardiac trabeculae and papillary muscles were skinned with Triton - X 100 detergent in a high ATP , low Ca 2 + , relaxing solution . Nylon sutures were fastened to the ends of the strips and then mounted onto the experimental apparatus to obtain force measurements . Single fibres of the semitendinosus muscle of frogs ( Rana temporaria ) were isolated under sili - cone oil ( 4 ° C ) . Using an electrolytically sharpened tungsten needle , the sarcolemma and basal lami - na were peeled off in relaxing solution 27 . Intact single fibres were dissected from the frog semitendinosus or ilio - fibularis muscle in Ringers solution ( 120 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 mM KCl , 1 . 8 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM PIPES pH 7 . 1 at 16 ° C ) . The tendons were used to secure the fibres to the experimental apparatus . At one end a gauge recorded twitch tension production . Each fibre was microinjected with a nonperturbing concentration of furaptra ( a low - affinity Ca 2 + indicator ) to measure the change in myoplasmic free Ca 2 + concentra - tion during stimulated twitches 28 . Activation of skinned muscle preparations The skinned fibre preparations were all activated using the same protocol . Solutions were exchanged by keeping the fibre bundle stationery and translating a trough assembly to a new 60 µ l chamber with the fresh solution . The fibres / bundles were first equilibrated in a relaxing solution ( REL ; 100 mM Tes , 5 mM MgATP , 1 mM Mg 2 + , 20 mM EGTA , 10 mM glutathione , 200 mM ionic strength , < 10 − 8 M free Ca 2 + , pH 7 . 1 at 20 ° C ) . The fibre was then incubated for at least 4 min in a preactivat - ing solution ( PRE , same as REL except 0 . 1 mM EGTA , 19 . 9 mM HDTA ) . The preparations were then activated ( ACT ) in the presence of ~ 32 µ M free Ca 2 + developing and maintaining tension for < 30 s . BTS , dissolved in DMSO , was added to the solutions . The frog skinned - fibre experiments were con - ducted at 16 ° C for consistency with the intact fibre experiments . They were incubated for 25 – 30 min in BTS before testing inhibition because of the slow onset of suppression for these fibres .
