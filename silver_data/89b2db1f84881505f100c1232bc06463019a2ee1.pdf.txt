Accordingly , low contents ( 1 mol % each ) of ﬂuorescently labeled derivatives of these lipids , namely 1 - palmitoyl - 2 [ 10 - ( pyren - 1 - yl ) ] decanoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( PyrPC ) , n - [ 10 - ( 1 - pyrenyl ) decanoyl ] sphingomyelin ( PyrSM ) , and increasing concen - trations of cholesterol ( up to 5 mol % ) , were included in large unilamellar vesicles composed of 1 , 2 - dimyristoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DMPC ) or 1 , 2 - dinervonoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DNPC ) , and the excimer / monomer ﬂuorescence emission ratio ( I e / I m ) was measured . In DNPC below the main phase transition , the addition of up to 5 mol % cholesterol reduced I e / I m signiﬁcantly . Except for this , cholesterol had only a negligible effect in both matrices and for both probes . We then compared the efﬁciency of resonance energy transfer from PyrPC and PyrSM to 22 - ( n - ( 7 - nitrobenz - 2 - oxa - 1 , 3 - diazol - 4 - yl ) amino ) - 23 , 24 - bisnor - 5 - cholen - 3 b - ol ( NBDchol ) . An augmenting colocalization of the latter resonance energy transfer pair with temperature was observed in a DMPC matrix below the main phase transition . In contrast , compared to PyrSM the colocalization of PyrPC with NBDchol was more efﬁcient in the longer DNPC matrix . These results could be conﬁrmed using 5 , 6 - dibromo - cholestan - 3 b - ol as a collisional quencher for the pyrene - labeled lipids . The results indicate lack of a speciﬁc interaction between sphingomyelin and cholesterol , and further imply that hydrophobic mismatch between the lipid constituents could provide the driving force for the cosegregation of sphingomyelin and cholesterol in ﬂuid phospholipid bilayers of thicknesses comparable to those found for biomembranes . INTRODUCTION The lipid bilayer provides the basic structural framework for cellular membranes . These soft interfaces are composed of a vast number of diverse lipid constituents ( Kinnunen , 1991 ) and in terms of physics are thus classiﬁed as many body systems possessing order on various time - as well as length scales ( Kinnunen , 1991 ; Jacobson et al . , 1995 ; Glaser , 1995 ; Mouritsen and Kinnunen , 1996 ; Varma and Mayor , 1998 ; Hwang et al . , 1998 ) . The physical properties and the thermo - dynamic state of the bilayer inﬂuence the functions and lateral organization of the contained membrane proteins ( Mustonen et al . , 1987 ; Hønger et al . , 1997 ; Vaz and Almeida , 1993 ) , whereas proteins also determine , in part , the ordering of the lipids in bilayer ( Mouritsen and Bloom , 1984 ; Asturias et al . , 1990 ; Lehtonen and Kinnunen , 1997 ) . The molecular mecha - nisms and processes underlying the dynamic ordering of bio - membranesarebeingintensivelyinvestigated ( e . g . , Mouritsen and Kinnunen , 1996 ; Mouritsen , 1998 ) . Recently , sphingomyelin and cholesterol have been sug - gested to form microdomains ( rafts ) , which then partici - pate to recruit proteins and lipid signaling molecules into these assemblies ( Brown and London , 2000 ) . Both cho - lesterol and sphingomyelin are abundant components of eukaryote membranes ( Bretscher and Munro , 1993 ) . These lipids have been shown to colocalize in the same membrane compartments , with [ 50 % of the cellular sphingomyelin and unesteriﬁed cholesterol found in the plasma membrane ( Kolesnick , 1991 ) . Manipulation of the membrane content of either cholesterol or sphingomyelin results in parallel changes in the rates of synthesis of these two lipids . Accordingly , loading of ﬁbroblast plasma membrane with sphingomyelin results in reduced esteriﬁcation of intracellular cholesterol and increased cholesterol synthesis leading to higher contents of cholesterol in the plasma membrane ( Gatt and Bierman , 1980 ) . Degradation of ﬁbroblast plasma membrane sphingo - myelin activates endogenous cholesterol esteriﬁcation and downregulates the activity of the rate - limiting enzyme of cho - lesterol synthesis , HMG - CoA reductase ( Slotte and Bierman , 1988 ; Gupta and Rudney , 1991 ) . The capacity of the plasma membrane to solubilize cholesterol appears to depend on the sphingomyelin content ( Okwu et al . , 1994 ) . Importantly , enzymatic degradation of cellular phosphatidylcholine does not affect cellular cholesterol esteriﬁcation ( Po¨rn et al . , 1993 ) . Furthermore , whereas enzymatic sphingomyelin degradation increases cholesterol efﬂux to b - cyclodextrin , degradation of phosphatidylcholine has no effect ( Ohvo et al . , 1997 ) . The physiological signiﬁcance of the metabolic coupling between cholesterol and sphingomyelin levels remains unknown , in addition to the actual molecular level mechanism ( s ) coupling the contents of these lipids in membranes . Complex formation due to a high afﬁnity interaction between sphingomyelin and cholesterol has been suggested . The origin of this hypothesis can be traced to the conden - sation of sphingomyelin monolayers in the presence of choles - Submitted May 7 , 2003 , and accepted for publication October 17 , 2003 .

In addition , cholesterol efﬂux from Langmuir ﬁlms to cyclodextrin added into the aqueous subphase has been shown to decrease when the sphingomyelin / phosphatidylcholine ratio is increased ( reviewed in Slotte , 1999 ) . This ﬁnding has been taken as evidence suggesting sphingomyelin to have higher afﬁnity to cholesterol than to the corresponding phosphatidylcholine . Subsequent studies in other laboratories using this technique suggest that sphingomyelin and cholesterol form condensed complexes with a stoichiometry of ; 2 : 1 ( Radhakrishnan et al . , 2000 , 2001 ; Li et al . , 2001 ) . However , phosphati - dylcholines also form condensed complexes with cholesterol ( Smaby et al . , 1994 , 1997 ; Keller et al . , 2000 ) . Importantly , conclusive evidence demonstrating lack of speciﬁc sphingo - myelin - cholesterol interaction has been presented ( Untracht and Shipley , 1977 ; Calhoun and Shipley , 1979 ; Lange et al . , 1979 ; Schroeder and Nemecz , 1989 ; Smaby et al . , 1994 ; Mannock et al . , 2003 ) . Sphingomyelin is composed of a polar phosphatidylcho - line headgroup , a long chain ( typically 18 carbon atoms ) sphingoid base , and an amide - linked acyl chain . Typically , the acyl chains are long ( 16 – 24 carbon atoms ) and saturated ( Curatolo , 1987 ) . These lipids typically have high chain melting temperatures , exceeding the body temperature of 37 8 C ( Estep et al . , 1979 ) . Compared to common unsaturated phosphatidylcholines , saturated fatty acids of the sphingoid base should favor van der Waals interactions with the rigid and planar tetracyclic ring system of cholesterol ( McIntosh et al . , 1992 ) . Both hydrogen - bond donating and accepting groups are found in the interfacial region of sphingomyelin ( Boggs , 1987 ) , in distinction from phosphoglycerides ( such as phosphatidylcholine ) with two hydrogen - bond accepting carbonyl groups ( Brown , 1998 ) . The 3 b - OH - group of cholesterol , which is positioned toward the aqueous in - terface , has been suggested to hydrogen - bond to the carbonyl group of the amide group of sphingomyelin ( Sankaram and Thompson , 1990 ; Bittman et al . , 1994 ) . Recent NMR study , however , reveals lack of hydrogen - bonding between sphin - gomyelin and cholesterol ( Guo et al . , 2002 ) . In this study we have addressed the putative interaction between cholesterol and sphingomyelin . Most of the pre - vious studies on this interaction have used large contents of sphingomyelin and / or cholesterol ( e . g . , Mattjus and Slotte , 1996 ; Needham and Nunn , 1990 ; Sankaram and Thompson , 1991 ; ) Ramstedt and Slotte , 1999 ; Radhakrishnan et al . , 2000 , 2001 ; Veiga et al . , 2001 ; Li et al . , 2001 ) , which might obscure possible speciﬁc interaction . Accordingly , we compared the impact of cholesterol on pyrene - labeled sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine derivatives at low concentrations in neutral phosphatidylcholine matrices . In addition , we also compared the efﬁciency of resonance energy transfer ( RET ) between trace amounts ( mol fraction , X ¼ 0 . 01 ) of either pyrene - labeled sphingomyelin ( PyrSM ) or phosphatidylcholine ( PyrPC ) and NBD - labeled choles - terol . Furthermore , the efﬁciency of collisional quenching of PyrSM and PyrPC by 5 , 6 - dibromo - cholestan - 3 b - ol was studied . Both dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine ( DMPC ) and dinervonoylphosphatidylcholine ( DNPC ) were compared as matrices to investigate the possible impact of hydrophobic mismatch on the distribution of the ﬂuorescent lipid analogs and cholesterol and its derivatives . The impact of the included ﬂuorescent tracers on the main phase transition of the matrix phospholipids was studied by differential scan - ning calorimetry ( DSC ) . In summary , we ﬁnd no evidence for a speciﬁc interaction between sphingomyelin and cholesterol , and postulate that the driving force for the colocalization of cholesterol and sphingomyelin in biomem - branes is provided by the hydrophobic matching condition . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials Cholesterol , DNPC , PyrSM , HEPES , and EDTA were obtained from Sigma ( St . Louis , MO ) and DMPC from Princeton Lipids ( Princeton , NJ ) . PyrPC was from K & V Bioware ( Espoo , Finland ) and 22 - ( n - ( 7 - nitrobenz - 2 - oxa - 1 , 3 - diazol - 4 - yl ) amino ) - 23 , 24 - bisnor - 5 - cholen - 3 b - ol ( NBDchol ) from Mo - lecular Probes ( Eugene , OR ) . No impurities were detected in the above lipids upon thin - layer chromatography on silicic acid - coated plates using chloroform / methanol / water / ammonia ( 65 : 20 : 2 : 2 , by volume ) as the solvent system and examination of the plates for pyrene or NBD ﬂuorescence under ultraviolet illumination or after iodine staining . The concentrations of DMPC , DNPC , and cholesterol were determined gravimetrically ( Cahn , Cerritos , CA ) . Concentrations of the ﬂuorescent lipids were determined by measuring absorbance at 342 nm and using 42 , 000 cm (cid:1) 1 as the molar extinction coefﬁcient for PyrPC and PyrSM . For NBDchol , 22 , 000 cm (cid:1) 1 at 465 nm was employed . Water was freshly deionized in a Milli RO / Milli Q ( Millipore , Billerica , MA ) ﬁltering system . Synthesis of 5 , 6 - dibromo - cholestan - 3 b - ol Cholesterol was converted into 5 , 6 - dibromo - cholestan - 3 b - ol ( diBrChol ) by reacting with bromide in acetic acid ( Streitwieser and Heathcock , 1985 ) . More speciﬁcally , cholesterol ( 1 . 0 g ) was added to a solution of bromide ( 0 . 5 g ) dissolved in acetic acid ( 5 . 0 ml ) . The reaction mixture was then left for 30 min at room temperature . The separated solid diBrChol was ﬁltered and rinsed with acetic acid ( 5 . 0 ml ) and puriﬁed water . Subsequently , the product was dried . Recrystallization from acetone gave pure product ( melting point 110 – 112 8 C ) , which revealed a single spot upon thin layer chromatography performed as above . Preparation of liposomes Samples were prepared by dissolving and mixing the indicated lipids in chloroform to obtain the desired compositions , whereafter the solvent was removed under a stream of nitrogen . The residues were subsequently maintained under reduced pressure for [ 2 h and then hydrated in 20 mM HEPES and 0 . 1 mM EDTA buffer at pH 7 . 0 at 65 8 C ( i . e . , exceeding the main phase transition temperature of the matrix lipid ) to yield a lipid concentration of one mM . The hydrated lipid mixtures were subsequently extruded with a LiposoFast small - volume homogenizer ( Avestin , Ottawa , Sphingomyelin - Cholesterol Interactions 1511 Biophysical Journal 86 ( 3 ) 1510 – 1520 Canada ) to obtain large unilamellar vesicles ( LUVs ) by subjecting the lipid dispersions to 19 passes through a polycarbonate ﬁlter ( 100 - nm pore size , Nucleopore , Pleasanton , CA ) . All samples were annealed by taking them ﬁve times through the transition by repeated heating and cooling between 0 and 37 8 C , whereafter they were stored at 4 8 C overnight . Fluorescence spectroscopy Fluorescence measurements were carried out with a PerkinElmer LS50B ( Wellesley , MA ) or a Cary Eclipse ( Varian Instruments , Walnut Creek , CA ) spectroﬂuorometer interfaced to a personal computer . Cuvette temperature was controlled by a circulating water bath , and the contents were con - tinuously agitated by a magnetic stirring bar . Pyrene - labeled lipids were excited at 344 nm , and monomer and excimer emission intensities were detected at 398 and 480 nm , respectively , with bandpasses of 4 . 0 nm . Due to the low concentrations of the chromophores used , inner ﬁlter effect can be expected to be negligible . When indicated , the two ﬂuorescent probes , PyrPC and PyrSM , were used as donors and NBDchol as RET acceptor in LUVs ( Jutila and Kinnunen , 1997 ) . Collisional quenching of pyrene excimer emission Heavy atoms such as iodine and bromine can be used as collisional quenchers for ﬂuorescence due to promoting intersystem crossing to an excited triplet state , promoted by spin - orbit coupling of the excited ﬂuorophore and the halogen ( Lakowicz , 1999 ) . Accordingly , we used diBrChol as a collisional quencher for the emission of PyrPC and PyrSM . For both RET and collisional quenching the data are expressed as colocalization parameter C . In brief , the colocalization of these pairs were assessed by deﬁning the colocalization parameter C as C ¼ ð I 0 (cid:1) I Þ = I 0 ; where I 0 and I are emission intensities at 480 nm measured for PyrPC / PyrSM in the absence and presence of the acceptor , respectively ( Jutila and Kinnunen , 1997 ) . In addition to the excitation peak at 470 nm , NBD has a second , signiﬁcantly weaker absorption band centered at ; 335 nm and accordingly , the latter could contribute to the 480 - nm excimer emission from the pyrene - labeled probes . However , this emission was found to be negligible ( data not shown ) . Maximum ( I ! 0 ) for C indicates augmented colocalization of the probes whereas minimum ( I ! I 0 ) reports the probes being dispersed in the membrane . Importantly , quantitative analysis of the resonance energy transfer data is ambiguous due to the lack of information on the orientation of the oscillating dipoles of the ﬂuorophores and uncertainty concerning probe distribution ( Drake et al . , 1991 ) . This drawback , however , does not compromise the qualitative conclusions of the present study . Furthermore , due to extensive , and compared to the ﬂuorescence lifetimes , very rapid thermal motion of the chromophores , it is highly unlikely that mutual orientation of the oscillating dipoles would limit the efﬁciency of RET . Accordingly , changes in RET can be readily expected to be mostly determined by changes in the average distances between the donor and acceptor ( Jutila and Kinnunen , 1997 ) . Final concentration of lipid was 25 m M . All temperature scans were performed by increasing the temperature in 0 . 1 – 1 . 1 8 C steps from 11 to 30 8 C ( DMPC ) or from 15 to 37 8 C ( DNPC ) , the average heating rate being ; 0 . 1 8 C / min close to the main phase transition of DMPC or DNPC . All experiments were repeated at least once to ensure reproducibility . Differential scanning calorimetry Differential heat capacity scans were recorded with a high - sensitivity differential scanning instrument VP - DSC ( MicroCal , Northampton , MA ) at a lipid concentration of 0 . 7 mM ( heating rate of 0 . 5 8 C / min ) . All experiments were performed in duplicates to ensure reproducibility . The calorimeter was interfaced to a personal computer and data were analyzed using the routines of the Origin software ( Microcal , Northampton , MA ) . We have routinely subjected both multilamellar vesicles ( MLVs ) as well as extruded vesicles to DSC ( Jutila and Kinnunen , 1997 ; Metso et al . , 2003 ) to check for the loss of material in the extrusion process . Between 25 and 50 % of DNPC was found to bind to the ﬁlters whereas DMPC appeared to be quantitatively recovered ( A . Metso and P . K . J . Kinnunen , unpublished results ) . Accordingly , because of the uncertainty regarding the actual mass only T m values are reported for LUVs . RESULTS Differential scanning calorimetry Differential scanning calorimetry was utilized to assess the impact of the ﬂuorescent probes on the thermotropic phase behavior of the studied lipid membranes . DMPC MLVs show upon heating two endotherms corresponding to the pretransition at ; 14 8 C and the main transition at ; 23 . 7 8 C . In keeping with our previous studies ( Jutila and Kinnunen , 1997 ) LUVs composed of this phospholipid lack the pretransition and exhibit a single endotherm at ; 24 . 1 8 C ( Table 1 ; see also Jutila and Kinnunen , 1997 ) . The amounts of the probes used ( 1 – 2 mol % ) in the ﬂuorescence measurements abolished the pretransition peak , broadened the main transition endotherm , and slightly shifted T m of DMPC MLVs . Likewise , the total enthalpy of the main transition peak was decreased , revealing reduced increment of trans ! gauche isomerization at the transition , which is likely to reﬂect the chain disordering effect of the probes below T m ( Jutila and Kinnunen , 1997 ; Metso et al . , 2003 ) . DNPC MLVs and LUVs show only the main phase transition endotherm at 26 . 9 and 26 . 7 8 C , respectively . Similarly to DMPC the utilized ﬂuorescent probes broaden the main phase transition endotherm of DNPC and lower the transition temperature ( Table 1 ) . Taken together , the above DSC data TABLE 1 The main transition temperatures ( T m ) for large unilamellar vesicles as well as T m and enthalpies for multilamellar vesicles with the indicated compositions T m , 8 C D H m , kJ / mol MLVs LUVs MLVs DMPC 23 . 7 24 . 1 25 . 2 PyrPC / DMPC ( 1 : 99 ) 23 . 6 23 . 9 22 . 3 PyrSM / DMPC ( 1 : 99 ) 23 . 6 23 . 5 22 . 5 PyrPC / NBDchol / DMPC ( 1 : 1 : 98 ) 23 . 4 23 . 8 23 . 2 PyrSM / NBDchol / DMPC ( 1 : 1 : 98 ) 23 . 1 23 . 5 21 . 1 PyrPC / diBrChol / DMPC ( 1 : 1 : 98 ) 23 . 3 23 . 6 22 . 9 PyrSM / diBrChol / DMPC ( 1 : 1 : 98 ) 23 . 2 23 . 5 22 . 9 DNPC 26 . 9 26 . 7 69 . 8 PyrPC / DNPC ( 1 : 99 ) 26 . 7 26 . 5 69 . 9 PyrSM / DNPC ( 1 : 99 ) 26 . 6 26 . 2 64 . 5 PyrPC / NBDchol / DNPC ( 1 : 1 : 98 ) 26 . 7 26 . 1 66 . 6 PyrSM / NBDchol / DNPC ( 1 : 1 : 98 ) 64 . 2 26 . 5 26 . 2 PyrPC / diBrChol / DNPC ( 1 : 1 : 98 ) 26 . 4 26 . 0 61 . 9 PyrSM / diBrChol / DNPC ( 1 : 1 : 98 ) 26 . 3 26 . 7 65 . 8 Total phospholipid concentration was 0 . 7 mM in 20 mM HEPES and 0 . 1 mM EDTA at pH 7 . 0 . 1512 Holopainen et al . Biophysical Journal 86 ( 3 ) 1510 – 1520 show that in these two types of liposomes ( i . e . , MLVs versus LUVs ) , the ﬂuorescent lipid analogs cause only a relatively minor perturbation of the thermotropic behavior of DMPC and DNPC . The behavior of pyrene - labeled lipids residing in DMPC and DNPC To study the putative complex formation by sphingomyelin / phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol excimer ﬂuorescence , resonance energy transfer and collisional quenching were utilized to gain insight into the organization of the ﬂuo - rescent lipid probes below , above , and at T m , of two neutral phosphatidylcholine matrices , DMPC and DNPC . DMPC matrix I e / I m for PyrPC residing in DMPC liposomes increases almost linearly upon heating up to ; 4 . 5 8 below T m , in keeping with increased lateral diffusion ( Hresko et al . , 1986 ; Lehtonen and Kinnunen , 1995 ) . Subsequently , a peak in I e / I m becomes evident ( denoted by T * in Fig . 1 A ) , preceding the peak in speciﬁc heat at T m ; 24 . 1 8 C determined by DSC . A likely explanation for the pronounced increase in the excimer formation at T 0 \ T \ T * for PyrPC in DMPC is lateral enrichment of the probe into the boundary between gel - and ﬂuid - like regions of the membrane ( Jutila and Kinnunen , 1997 ) . First derivative d ( I e / I m ) versus ( T – T m ) reveals a baseline process progressively enhancing I e / I m whereas there is a abrupt increase beginning at ; 4 . 5 8 C and peaking at ; 1 . 5 8 C below T m ( Jutila and Kinnunen , 1997 ) . Just below T m the values for I e / I m return close to the ascending baseline attributed to the thermally enhanced excimer formation , increasing I e / I m linearly with further increase in temperature . Notably , the slope of the I e / I m versus ( T – T m ) curve is augmented above T m compared to the slope below T m , thus implying that the thermally activated increments in the rate of lateral diffusion in gel and ﬂuid phases are not of similar magnitude . Compared to PyrPC the I e / I m ratio for PyrSM residing in DMPC liposomes is signiﬁcantly lower ( Fig . 1 A ) . The lower efﬁciency of excimer formation in dipalmitoylphosphatidyl - choline matrix by PyrSM compared to PyrPC has been suggested to reﬂect slower lateral diffusion of the former probe ( Somerharju et al . , 1985 ; Hresko et al . , 1987 ) . Transition temperature measured for PyrSM is higher than for PyrPC ( 43 and 15 8 C , respectively ; Somerharju et al . , 1985 ; Hresko et al . , 1987 ) . Judged from the enthalpies derived from DSC the disordering effect by PyrPC is more signiﬁcant than that due to PyrPC . For both probes their phosphocholine headgroup is nearly parallel to the mem - brane surface . Repulsive potential due to the strongly hydrated headgroups would thus prevent close intermolec - ular encounters for both PyrPC and PyrSM . It can be anticipated that because of the higher melting temperature of PyrSM the chains of this probe are on the average more ordered than those of PyrPC . Accordingly , the effective length of PyrSM should exceed that of PyrPC and the pyrene moiety of the former probe should therefore interdigitate into the adjacent leaﬂet more efﬁciently than PyrPC , thus reducing I e / I m . This would be in keeping with the slightly reduced enthalpy observed by DSC ( Table 1 ) . Similarly to PyrPC the I e / I m values for PyrSM increase monotonically from 0 . 026 to 0 . 033 upon heating to ; 2 8 below T m ( ; 23 . 5 8 C ) . A local minimum is observed at T m , and is followed by a continuous and approximately linear increase in I e / I m . Interestingly , the decrease in I e / I m ( from T * to T m ) for PyrSM is less steep and takes place over a wider temperature range than for PyrPC . The absence of the transient peak in I e / I m for PyrSM indicates that this probe behaves in a different way in this temperature range , probably being enriched into microdomains and preferring FIGURE 1 ( A ) I e / I m versus T – T m for PyrPC ( j ) and PyrSM ( u ) residing in LUVs of DMPC at X probe of 0 . 01 .

For PyrSM I e / I m versus ( T – T m ) the slopes below and above T m are approximately equal . First derivative d ( I e / I m ) versus ( T – T m ) shows that the transient peak in I e / I m between 4 . 5 and 1 . 5 8 below T m observed for PyrPC is lacking for PyrSM , and only the baseline process increases I e / I m ( not shown ) . DNPC matrix Increasing the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer by substituting DNPC for DMPC causes an increase by one order of magnitude in I e / I m for PyrPC when T \ T m ( Fig . 1 B ) . Although lateral diffusion of this probe could be higher in DNPC it is also possible that interdigitation and possibly also tilting of chains could reduce I e / I m in DMPC . Only modest changes in I e / I m for PyrPC are observed below T m , with the decrement in I e / I m for PyrPC beginning at ; 6 8 below T m . Above T m there is a slight increase in I e / I m . Similarly to PyrPC also for PyrSM the I e / I m values were signiﬁcantly higher in DNPC . Compared to PyrPC the I e / I m values for PyrSM in DNPC are lower below T m , in keeping with the data on DMPC LUVs , whereas at T [ T m the I e / I m ratios are approximately equal for both probes ( Fig . 1 B ) . First derivative d ( I e / I m ) versus ( T – T m ) revealed the behavior of PyrSM to be almost identical to PyrPC ( not shown ) . Effect of cholesterol Subsequent to observing the temperature - dependent changes in I e / I m for the two pyrene - labeled lipids , PyrPC and PyrSM in DMPC and DNPC matrices , we investigated the effects of cholesterol on these probes . Increasing the contents of cholesterol ( up to 5 mol % ) in DMPC LUVs had negligible effect on the I e / I m for PyrPC as well as PyrSM both below as well as above T m ( Fig . 2 A ) . For the thicker DNPC bilayer inclusion of cholesterol caused a pronounced and progressive decrease in I e / I m for both PyrPC and PyrSM below T m ( Fig . 2 B ) . However , above T m no changes in I e / I m for either PyrPC or PyrSM were observed . Resonance energy transfer between pyrene - labeled lipids and NBD - cholesterol Cholesterol has been suggested to reduce line tension between coexisting solid and ﬂuid domains , favoring its partitioning into the interface ( Weis and McConnell , 1985 ; McConnell , 1991 ; Hwang et al . , 1995 ; Mouritsen et al . , 1995 ) . The spectral properties of NBD allow this probe to function as RET acceptor for pyrene . Accordingly , we have previously demonstrated using 22 - ( n - ( 7 - nitrobenz - 2 - oxa - 1 , 3 - diazol - 4 - yl ) amino ) - 23 , 24 - bisnor - 5 - cholen - 3 b - ol ( at X ¼ 0 . 01 ) , i . e . , a cholesterol analog containing a covalently - linked NBD moiety , that PyrPC and NBDchol become colocalized in the course of the main transition of DMPC ( Jutila and Kinnunen , 1997 ) . In this study , we compared two RET pairs—namely , PyrSM with NBDchol and PyrPC with NBDchol . DMPC matrix In keeping with our earlier study ( Jutila and Kinnunen , 1997 ) the inﬂuence of NBDchol on the temperature dependence of I e / I m for PyrPC is dramatic ( Fig . 3 A ) . For PyrPC in the presence of NBDchol the values for I e / I m increase pro - gressively with temperature , whereas the peak observed at T * in the absence of the quencher is lacking . The fact that I e / I m is increased by NBDchol is likely to reﬂect efﬁcient quenching of pyrene by this acceptor and colocalization of NBDchol and PyrPC over the whole temperature range FIGURE 2 I e / I m versus increasing contents of cholesterol for PyrPC and PyrSM residing in LUVs of DMPC ( A ) and DNPC ( B ) below ( 15 8 C ; j , PyrPC ; d , PyrSM ) and above ( 40 8 C ; (cid:1) , PyrPC ; (cid:2) , PyrSM ) the main phase transition temperature of the matrix lipid .

Thereafter a peak in colocalization is evident at T * , subsequently followed by a minimum at ; T m . Upon further increase in temperature above T m there is a slight increase in C . Assuming NBDchol to favor partitioning into the gel - ﬂuid interface similarly to cholesterol , the data strongly suggest the peak in I e / I m for PyrPC at T * to result from a preference of this probe and NBDchol for the domain boundary . In the presence of NBDchol the I e / I m values for PyrSM are signiﬁcantly lower throughout the temperature range studied ( Fig . 3 A ) . There is no increase in I e / I m upon increasing the temperature up to 1 . 5 8 below T m whereafter this ratio increases nearly linearly . In contrast to PyrPC / NBDchol , C versus ( T – T m ) for PyrSM / NBDchol / DMPC mixture reveals efﬁcient colocalization of these probes well below T m , with no local minima ( Fig . 3 B ) . Subsequently , a peak in colocalization at T * is evident , followed by a minimum at ; T m . Further increase in temperature induces a slight increase in C . Above T m the lower values for C in PyrSM / NBDchol versus PyrPC / NBDchol could result from lower lateral diffusion rate for PyrSM compared to PyrPC . Notably , comparing the absolute values for C between different RET pairs is ambiguous , as discussed previously . Yet , our data suggest a pronounced colocalization of PyrSM and NBDchol into the emerging phase boundary between ﬂuid and gel phase domains . DNPC matrix The inﬂuence of NBDchol on the temperature dependency of I e / I m for PyrPC in DNPC matrix was much less dramatic than FIGURE 3 Values for I e / I m versus T – T m for DMPC LUVs incorporating PyrPC ( j ) or PyrSM ( (cid:1) ) ( X ¼ 0 . 01 ) together with NBDchol ( X ¼ 0 . 01 ) ( A ) Colocalization parameter C versus T – T m calculated for the respective PyrPC - ( j ) or PyrSM - ( (cid:1) ) NBDchol acceptor pair ( B ) .

The experimental conditions were similar to those described in Fig . 1 . Sphingomyelin - Cholesterol Interactions 1515 Biophysical Journal 86 ( 3 ) 1510 – 1520 in DMPC . In contrast to the results obtained with DMPC , the I e / I m ratio throughout the studied temperature range is decreased when NBDchol is present ( Fig . 3 C ) . At ; 6 8 below T m a sudden decrease in I e / I m ratio becomes evident , reﬂecting the gel - to - ﬂuid melting process ( es ) . Interestingly , a high degree of colocalization of PyrPC with NBDchol is evident at all studied temperatures ( Fig . 3 D ) , with C versus ( T – T m ) revealing slightly enhanced colocalization when T ! T m with a maximum at ; 2 8 below T m . Subsequently , a minimum is observed at ; T m , with further increase in T resulting in a minor increment in C . Throughout the temperature range NBDchol has only a minor effect on the I e / I m ratio for PyrSM ( Fig . 3 C ) , and C versus ( T – T m ) for PyrSM / NBDchol reveals much less colocalization for these probes compared to PyrPC / NBDchol ( Fig . 3 D ) . No changes in C are seen when T \ T m . At ; 6 8 below T m the I e / I m ratio begins to rapidly decrease reaching a minimum at T m . In contrast to DMPC matrix , no enhanced colocalization is observed in the vicinity of T m and at T [ T m no changes in C are observed ( Fig . 3 D ) . Collisional quenching of pyrene excimer emission by 5 , 6 - dibromo - cholestan - 3 b - ol Due to its relatively large ﬂuorophore moiety NBDchol can be presumed not to behave identically to cholesterol . Accord - ingly , to verify the above results with a less perturbing cholesterol analog , we used the collisional quencher 5 , 6 - dibromo - cholestan - 3 b - ol instead of NBDchol . The bromi - nated derivative lacks the ﬂuorophore moiety and can thus be anticipated to behave more similarly , albeit not identically , to natural cholesterol . The colocalization of PyrSM and PyrPC with diBrChol was compared in DMPC and DNPC matrices by calculating parameter C as deﬁned above . Regarding the differences in the resonance energy transfer and collisional quenching data it is important to take into account that RET occurs over considerably longer distances and includes quenching of the donor also in the adjacent leaﬂet of the bilayer . Instead , collisional quenching requires actual mol - ecular encounters . DMPC matrix Except for the values for I e / I m being smaller the inﬂuence of diBrChol on the temperature dependency of I e / I m for PyrPC in DMPC was very similar to that of NBDchol ( data not shown ) . C versus ( T – T m ) reveals close range colocalization to diminish progressively upon increasing temperature , reaching a local minimum at T m ( Fig . 4 A ) . Above T m there is a slight increase in C . For PyrSM with diBrChol the values for I e / I m were lower than for PyrPC , and only a modest increase in I e / I m was observed , similarly to the above results for PyrSM with NBDchol . However , C versus ( T – T m ) revealed efﬁcient close range colocalization throughout the whole temperature range studied , with a slight increase in C below T m ( Fig . 4 A ) . At T m a local minimum is observed whereas further increase in temperature causes a small increment in C . DNPC matrix The inﬂuence of diBrChol on the temperature dependency of I e / I m of PyrPC was very similar to that observed for NBDchol with lower I e / I m ratios measured ( not shown ) . Throughout the studied temperature range an efﬁcient colo - calization of PyrPC with diBrChol is observed ( Fig . 4 B ) . In brief , when T \ T m a small increase in C ( enhanced close range colocalization ) is evident . At ; 2 8 below T m a sudden decrease in C is seen , with a minimum at ; T m . Further increase in T does not inﬂuence C . For PyrSM with diBrChol the I e / I m values are lower than for PyrPC ( not shown ) . C versus ( T – T m ) shows smaller C values for PyrSM / diBrChol / DNPC compared to PyrPC / diBrChol / DNPC mixtures ( Fig . 4 B ) . In brief , below T m a slight decrease in C is observed , followed by a minimum at T m . At T [ T m a further decrement in C is evident . DISCUSSION This study was undertaken to explore the putative speciﬁc interaction between sphingomyelin and cholesterol . Our ap - proach relied on the comparison between pyrene - labeled derivatives of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin , PyrPC and PyrSM , respectively . Although the bulky pyrene moiety can be expected to distort the characteristics of these probes compared to the natural lipids , we may nevertheless anticipate the extent and nature of the perturbation to be equal for both lipid analogs . Furthermore , the pyrene moiety resides at the end of a 10 - carbon atom spacer in both . Studies on the effects of cholesterol on phospholipids have revealed an increase in acyl chain order for carbon atoms 1 – 7 , whereas a decrease in the order parameter was evident for the carbon atoms [ 7 ( Rog and Pasenkiewicz - Gierula , 2001 ) . This means that the membrane free volume distribution changes in the bilayer , increasing in the center in the presence of cholesterol . As the pyrene moiety is linked via a decanoyl chain , this causes the ﬂuorophore to reside on the average deep in the bilayer . Accordingly , we may expect the pyrene moiety not to perturb the interactions between the planar sterol ring structure and the phospholipid acyl chain segments . Lastly , like for saturated phospholipids the calorimetric transition temperatures T m for PyrSM and PyrPC used in this study are 43 and 15 8 C , respectively . In the light of the above we do consider it to be very unlikely that the presence of pyrene would fundamentally alter the behavior of the SM derivative , in particular its interactions with cholesterol . Pyrene - labeled lipid derivatives have been extensively used in studies on biomembranes and their models ( Lotta et al . , 1988 ) . Accordingly , their behavior is well documented 1516 Holopainen et al . Biophysical Journal 86 ( 3 ) 1510 – 1520 and understanding of the deviation of their properties from natural lipids can be exploited in the interpretation of the collected ﬂuorescence data . PyrPC represents a substantial perturbing impurity to the packing of the DMPC and has been suggested to be distributed in a pseudohexagonal lattice to minimize the extent of perturbation ( Somerharju et al . , 1985 ; Virtanen et al . , 1988 ; Tang and Chong , 1992 ) . Partitioning of PyrPC into gel and ﬂuid regions of DMPC should be approximately equal . Yet , upon increasing the temperature to T 0 PyrPC becomes transiently enriched in the formed ﬂuid - in - gel domain boundaries ( Jutila and Kinnunen , 1997 ) , the sudden decrease in I e / I m just below T m reﬂecting the disappearance of domain boundaries . Further increase in temperature ( T [ T m ) is likely to result in a uniform pseudohexagonal distribution of PyrPC ( Somerharju et al . , 1985 ) . Below T m of DMPC the sphingomyelin probe , PyrSM , forms clusters and prefers partitioning into the gel phase . Upon approaching T m a decrease in I e / I m is observed and could reﬂect the disappearance of the gel phase and redistribution and dispersion of PyrSM molecules into the ﬂuid matrix . Above T m PyrSM is likely to be arranged into a pseudohexagonal lattice , similarly to PyrPC . In the longer DNPC matrix PyrPC and PyrSM behave very differently . Both probes show a smooth and continuous behavior with I e / I m decreasing progressively upon T ! T m . Notably , I e / I m values in the gel state DNPC are ; 1 order - of - magnitude higher compared to DMPC . This is likely to result from the lack of constraints imposed by hydrophobic mismatch between the constituents ( Lehtonen et al . , 1996 ) . In brief , the lengths of PyrPC and PyrSM exceed that of DMPC whereas both probes are signiﬁcantly shorter than DNPC . The difference in I e / I m measured in the two matrices is likely to be due to interdigitation of the pyrene moieties into the hydrocarbon tails of the adjacent monolayer in DMPC , thus reducing collisional encounters required for the excimer formation . In keeping with the higher T m for PyrSM than for PyrPC ( 43 versus 15 8 C ) the chains of PyrSM should be more ordered and therefore the extent of interdigitation for PyrSM should exceed that for PyrPC . Accordingly , in DMPC the I e / I m values for PyrSM should be lower than for PyrPC , as observed . Approaching T m of DNPC the disper - sion of the clustered probes cause a sharp decrease in I e / I m . Above T m of DNPC the values for I e / I m for both probes are nearly equal , yet slightly smaller for PyrSM . After the characterization of the temperature - dependent ﬂuorescence behavior of the two probes in DMPC and DNPC we proceeded to investigate the effects of cholesterol on I e / I m for the two probes both below and above the T m of the matrices . As already outlined above speciﬁcity in the inter - action of cholesterol and PyrSM over PyrPC could readily be anticipated to be reﬂected in I e / I m values . Moreover , the only perturbing factor is represented by the pyrene moiety and their perturbation can be expected to be relatively small , in addition to being identical for both probes . Accordingly , if cholesterol would preferentially interact with either PyrPC or PyrSM this should cause a more pronounced decrease in I e / I m for the probe preferred by cholesterol . The results show ( Fig . 2 ) that cholesterol does not show any preferential interaction between PyrSM and the cholesterol derivatives either in DMPC or in ﬂuid DNPC . In gel state DNPC we see pro - nounced and progressive decrement in I e / I m for both probes upon increasing cholesterol , in keeping with colocalization of cholesterol into the clusters enriched with the pyrene deri - vatives . We cannot exclude the possibility that the I e / I m would not detect small differences in the preference of inter - action between cholesterol and PyrPC or PyrSM .

( B ) Colocalization parameter C versus T – T m calculated for the PyrPC ( j ) or PyrSM ( (cid:1) ) with 5 , 6 - dibromo - cholestan - 3 b - ol collisional quencher pair residing in DNPC matrix . The experimental conditions were similar to those described in Fig . 1 . Sphingomyelin - Cholesterol Interactions 1517 Biophysical Journal 86 ( 3 ) 1510 – 1520 In a DMPC matrix and both in the presence as well as in the absence of the RET acceptor NBDchol the values of I e / I m are signiﬁcantly lower for PyrSM than for PyrPC in the temperature range studied . In the gel phase ( from 13 to 6 8 C below T m ) , colocalization C of PyrPC and NBDchol decreases with temperature , whereas the opposite is observed for PyrSM ( Fig . 3 B ) . The latter would be in keeping with the preferential partitioning of both PyrSM and NBDchol into the gel phase . Starting from T 0 both NBDchol and PyrPC enrich into the domain boundaries as shown by the increase in C ( Jutila and Kinnunen , 1997 ) . This is observed also for PyrSM and NBDchol . The maximum in C for PyrSM and NBDchol is observed at a slightly lower temperature than for PyrPC and NBDchol and could reﬂect a preference of PyrSM for the gel domains instead of the boundary ( Veiga et al . , 2001 ) . At T m minima are observed in I e / I m as well as C for both probes . Distinctly from DMPC the I e / I m ratios for PyrSM and PyrPC show similar behavior in the presence of NBDchol both below and above the T m of DNPC , contradicting a speciﬁc interaction between sphingomyelin and choles - terol . In brief , the presence of the RET acceptor should decrease I e / I m . In a DNPC matrix the opposite is observed , i . e . , PyrPC appears to colocalize more efﬁciently with NBDchol than PyrSM ( Fig . 3 D ) . The driving force for the colocalization of PyrSM with NBDchol in DMPC is likely to derive from the slightly longer hydrophobic thickness of PyrSM compared to PyrPC . Instead , in DNPC it is likely to be the chain - chain interactions of this matrix that will drive PyrPC to colocalize with cholesterol . The RET results align with the data on collisional quenching of the pyrene - labeled lipids by diBrChol . In DMPC below T m the values for C for PyrPC and diBrChol decreases . However , the sudden increase in C for PyrPC and NBDchol beginning at ; 6 8 below T m is not observed for diBrChol . This could imply that the peak in C at T * reﬂects the properties of NBDchol . Due to the covalently linked ﬂuorophore moiety NBDchol is signiﬁcantly longer than diBrChol . The slight increase in C in at T [ T m is likely to result from increased lateral mobility . The value for C measured for PyrSM / diBrChol in DMPC is much higher throughout the temperature range studied revealing co - enrichment of these probes , in contrast to PyrPC / diBrChol . Importantly , a small increase in C is observed below T m supporting the RET data . At T m a local minimum is observed followed by a slight increase in C above T m . Taken together , the data for PyrSM and diBrChol are consistent with the PyrSM / NBDchol RET data . In DNPC matrix the opposite is observed , namely efﬁcient colocalization of PyrPC with diBrChol and weaker colocalization of PyrSM with diBrChol , in perfect agreement with NBDchol RET data measured in this matrix . Lastly , it should be emphasized that both the RET studies and the collisional quenching data also included perturbing moieties in the cholesterol . Accordingly , although the results are in good agreement with the I e / I m results on the impact of cholesterol on PyrPC and PyrSM , it must be stressed that the presence of the NBD moiety and the iodines in cholesterol could sterically impair the interactions of this sterol with lipids compared to natural cholesterol . The above results indicate a lack of a speciﬁc interaction between sphingomyelin and cholesterol and that the observed colocalization of cholesterol with either PyrPC or PyrSM in a DMPC matrix is likely to be explained by the hydrophobic mismatch of the constituents . This also provides a rational explanation for the reciprocal regulation of sphingomyelin and cholesterol levels in cells ( Bretscher and Munro , 1993 ) . Most of the evidence for a sphingomyelin - cholesterol com - plex formation derives from the apparent condensation observed in monolayers . Yet , this condensation is observed not only for sphingomyelin and cholesterol but has also been reported for phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol ( Smaby et al . , 1994 , 1997 ) as well as DMPC and ceramide ( Holopainen et al . , 2001 ) . To this end , the packing of lipids is determined by their effective shapes ( Israelachvili et al . , 1980 ) and is related to the lateral pressure proﬁle ( Cantor , 1997 ) , with steric repulsion between the headgroups and the acyl chains , the effective size of the latter being determined by conﬁgurational entropy . The effective size of the head - groups also contains contribution by their hydration shells ( Lehtonen and Kinnunen , 1995 ) . Comparison of the com - pression isotherms for sphingomyelin and ceramide ( the latter lacking the phosphocholine headgroup ) reveals that a considerable fraction of the area occupied by sphingomye - lin , ; 8 A˚ 2 at 30 mN / m for n - palmitoyl - sphingomyelin ( Holopainen et al . , 2001 ) , is due to the phosphocholine head - group residing in the interface . This means that the weakly hydrated cholesterol can be partly accommodated underneath the headgroup , thus causing an apparent condensation in the compression isotherms . This conclusion was reached in recent Monte Carlo simulations of cholesterol - phospholipid mixtures showing that exposure of weakly hydrated choles - terol to water is energetically unfavorable and necessitates the formation of hydration shield by the strongly hydrated phosphocholine headgroup ( Huang and Feigenson , 1999 ; Huang , 2002 ) . Furthermore , the apparent condensation also has an apparent stoichiometry , determined by the sums of the molecular geometries and respective projections of surface areas . Due to the chain ordering effect of cholesterol the actual measured condensation is enhanced . Similar consid - erations apply to mixed monolayers of phosphatidylcholines and cholesterol ( Smaby et al . , 1994 ) . The other line of evidence for sphingomyelin - cholesterol complex formation derives from the variation of rates of scavenging cholesterol from sphingomyelin / cholesterol monolayers by cyclodextrin into the subphase . Also in this system steric shielding of cholesterol by sphingomyelin headgroup together with the augmented van der Waals interactions between SM and cholesterol would readily explain the slower absorption rates at sphingomyelin / cholesterol stoichiometry \ 2 : 1 ( Ohvo and Slotte , 1996 ) . To this end , steric shielding of chole - sterol by the phospholipid headgroups was suggested by 1518 Holopainen et al . Biophysical Journal 86 ( 3 ) 1510 – 1520 Barenholz and co - workers , studying the action of chole - sterol oxidase on monolayers ( Patzer et al . , 1978 ) . Lastly , the formation of the putative liquid - ordered domains constituted by sphingomyelin and cholesterol in a liquid - disordered membrane composed of unsaturated phosphatidylcholine , driven by hydrophobic mismatch , can be regarded as some - what analogous to the formation of micelles , albeit in a two - dimensionalsystem . Theirorganizationisthushighlydynamic and the segregated liquid - ordered domains should be at rapid equilibriumwithmonomericsphingolipidandcholesteroldis - solved in the bulk phosphatidylcholine , with rapid exchange between the two phases .
