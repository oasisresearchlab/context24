However , the primary sites of action for each of the yeast synaptojanin - like proteins remain unclear . In this study , we show that Sjl2 is localized to cortical actin patches , sites of endocytosis . Cortical recruitment of Sjl2 requires the actin patch component Abp1 . Consistent with this , the SH3 domain - containing protein Abp1 physically associates with Sjl2 through its proline - rich domain . Furthermore , abp1 (cid:1) mutations confer defects resembling loss of SJL2 ; sjl1 (cid:1) abp1 (cid:1) double - mutant cells exhibit invaginated plasma membranes and impaired endocytosis , ﬁndings similar to those for sjl1 (cid:1) sjl2 (cid:1) mutant cells . Thus , Abp1 acts as an adaptor protein in the localization or concentration of Sjl2 during late stages of endocytic vesicle formation . Overexpression of the Hip1 - related protein Sla2 delayed the formation of extended plasma membrane invaginations in sjl2 ts cells , indicating that Sla2 may become limiting or misregulated in cells with impaired PI phosphatase activity . Consistent with this , the cortical actin patch protein Sla2 is mislocalized in sjl1 (cid:1) sjl2 (cid:1) mutant cells . Together , our studies suggest that PI metabolism by the synaptojanin - like proteins coordinately directs actin dynamics and membrane invagination , in part by regulation of Sla2 . Phosphoinositides ( PI ) control numerous cellular processes including cell signaling , growth , vesicular trafﬁcking , and actin cytoskeletal arrangements ( 8 , 43 , 50 , 54 ) . In particular , phos - phatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] provides impor - tant regulatory roles at the cell surface , as a precursor of the signaling molecules DAG and IP 3 , and through direct interac - tions with downstream effector proteins ( 31 , 34 ) . During en - docytic internalization , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 recruits or activates several proteins , including the clathrin adaptor complex AP - 2 , AP180 , epsin , and the GTPase dynamin , leading to the formation and ﬁssion of clathrin - coated vesicles ( 13 , 15 , 16 , 25 , 40 ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 also recruits or controls several actin - regulatory proteins ( 54 ) . Actin polymerization may provide a propulsive force to facil - itate membrane invagination and ﬁssion events or to transport newly formed endocytic vesicles away from the plasma mem - brane . Thus , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis plays several important roles in the formation and ﬁssion of clathrin - coated vesicles during endocytosis . Likewise , previous studies implicate dephosphorylation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by the polyphosphoinositide phosphatase ( PPIPase ) synaptojanin as an important step in endocytic internalization ( 7 , 22 , 27 , 41 , 42 , 51 ) . Synaptojanins contain two distinct PI phosphatase domains and a C - terminal proline - rich domain ( PRD ) . The N - terminal Sac1 domain ( PPIPase domain ) acts on several positions of the inositol ring , while its central phos - phatase domain speciﬁcally acts at the 5 (cid:2) position ( 5 - Pase do - main ) ( 20 , 37 ) . The PRD region functions as a targeting do - main via interactions with various SH3 domain - containing proteins , such as endophilin , amphiphysin , and CIN85 ( 5 , 28 , 42 , 45 , 51 ) . Coated vesicles accumulate in cells bearing genetic disruptions of synaptojanin isoforms in the mouse , Drosophila melanogaster , and Caenorhabditis elegans , suggesting that turn - over of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 mediates release of coat proteins from mem - branes of newly formed vesicles ( 7 , 22 , 51 ) . Since synaptojanins regulate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - mediated actin polymerization , they may also control earlier vesicle formation and / or ﬁssion events , along with their role in postﬁssion vesicle uncoating . Three synaptojanin - like proteins are present in Saccharomy - ces cerevisiae : Sjl1 , Sjl2 , and Sjl3 ( also named Inp51 , Inp52 , and Inp53 ) ( 46 , 49 ) . Like mammalian synaptojanin , Sjl2 and Sjl3 exhibit Sac1 PPIPase activities , and all three possess 5 - Pase activity ( Fig . 1 ) ( 20 ) . Factors that target the yeast synaptojanin - like proteins via their PRDs have yet to be demonstrated in vivo . Interestingly , the C - terminal domains of Sjl1 , Sjl2 , and Sjl3 do not share extensive identity ( Fig . 1 ) . Thus , while syn - aptojanins display similar activities in vitro , each may provide specialized functions in vivo and may be uniquely recruited or activated at distinct membrane sites . Previous studies have indicated that Sjl2 provides essential overlapping functions at both the plasma membrane and in - tracellular endosomal / late Golgi compartments ( 17 , 44 , 46 , 48 , 49 ) . Moreover , we have shown that yeast cells expressing only a temperature - conditional SJL2 allele inappropriately accumu - * Corresponding author .

These ﬁnd - ings have thus led to the question of whether Sjl2 acts primarily at the plasma membrane or at endosomes in the control of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 steady - state distribution . To address this question , we have examined the localization of Sjl2 in vivo . Sjl2 was recruited to cortical actin patches in a manner dependent on ﬁlamentous actin and the PRD of Sjl2 . We further addressed how Sjl2 is recruited to its site of action at the plasma mem - brane and found that the SH3 - containing protein Abp1 was essential for this process . Finally , we found that overexpression of the ANTH domain - containing protein Sla2 can partially suppress the endocytic defects in sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 ts sjl3 (cid:3) mutant cells , suggesting that Sla2 becomes a limiting factor during endocytic internalization in cells with impaired PI 5 - Pase activity . MATERIALS AND METHODS Yeast strains and plasmid constructions . Standard yeast genetic methods to create integrated deletions , truncations , and fusions were used throughout ( 33 ) . Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 . Primers used in this study are available upon request . To generate the Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) fusion used in these studies , the 0 . 6 - kb EcoRI fragment ( encoding the 39 C - terminal residues of Sjl2 ) was removed from pRS416 SJL2 ( 48 ) to create pRS416 SJL2 (cid:3) RI , which then had a unique EcoRI site . PCR was then used to amplify GFP ( S65T ) - encoding se - quences . The resulting product was digested with EcoRI and subcloned in frame and in the appropriate orientation into pRS416 SJL2 (cid:3) RI , which was cleaved with EcoRI to create pRS416 SJL2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP . To generate the Sjl2 (cid:3) PRD - GFP fusion , the 3 . 7 - kb SalI - XhoI fragment from pRS416 SJL2 was subcloned into pRS416 cleaved with XhoI to create pRS416 SJL2 (cid:3) XI , which then had a unique XhoI site and thus excluded 190 C - terminal residues encoding the PRD of Sjl2 . PCR was then used to amplify GFP ( S65T ) - encoding sequences . The resulting product was digested with XhoI - EcoRI and subcloned in frame into pRS416 SJL2 (cid:3) XI , which was cleaved with XhoI - EcoRI . The K1120V and P1121D mutations were intro - duced into pRS416 SJL2 - GFP by QuikChange mutagenesis ( Stratagene , La Jolla , Calif . ) . In order to overexpress SLA2 from a multicopy plasmid , a 4 . 3 - kb EcoRI fragment encompassing the SLA2 locus ( 53 ) was subcloned into pRS426 , which had been cleaved with EcoRI . Generation of Sjl2 - speciﬁc antisera , immunoﬂuorescence , and microscopy on intact cells . A 0 . 7 - kb HindIII fragment of SJL2 encompassing codons 893 to 1129 was subcloned into pGEX - KG , and the resulting glutathione S - transferase fusion protein was inducibly expressed in Escherichia coli , puriﬁed from bacterial ex - tracts , and then used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits as described previously ( 2 ) . Resulting antibodies were further puriﬁed by acetone extracts of sjl2 (cid:3) cells . Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy procedures were carried out essen - tially as described previously ( 2 , 17 ) , except that cells were costained with rho - damine phalloidin according to the manufacturer’s recommendations ( Molecu - lar Probes , Eugene , Oreg . ) . To monitor endocytosis , cells were labeled with FM4 - 64 ( Molecular Probes ) as described elsewhere ( 48 ) . Brieﬂy , cells were grown to early - log phase in yeast extract - peptone - dextrose ( YPD ) and shifted to the appropriate temperature for 90 min . Cells ( 2 OD 600 [ optical density at 600 nm ] units ) were harvested by centrifugation and labeled with 16 nM FM4 - 64 and 100 nM CMAC ( Molecular Probes ) in YPD prewarmed to the appropriate temperature , followed by a chase in YPD without the vital dyes at the appropriate temperature for 30 min . Cells were concentrated and visualized by ﬂuorescence microscopy . Live cells expressing Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP , Sjl2 (cid:3) PRD - GFP , Sjl2 K1120V , P1121D , (cid:3) 37C - GFP , or Sla2 - GFP were grown to mid - log phase and harvested for visualization .

For FM4 - 64 staining of the plasma mem - brane , cells were grown to mid - log phase at the appropriate temperature , incu - bated at the restrictive temperature for 90 min when indicated , and then har - vested . Metabolic inhibitors ( 10 mM NaN 3 and NaF ) were applied , and nonviable cells were stained with FM4 - 64 ( Molecular Probes ) at 0°C , as de - scribed elsewhere ( 44 , 48 ) . Cells were visualized on a Zeiss Axiovert S1002TV ﬂuorescence microscope equipped with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate and rhoda - mine ﬁlters , captured with a Photometrix camera , and deconvolved by using Delta Vision software ( Applied Precision , Issaquah , Wash . ) . Fields showing localization of GFP - tagged forms of Sjl2 were two - dimensional representations of several Z - sections using Delta Vision software . Results presented were based on observations of more than 100 cells . For live - cell two - color movies following Sjl2 - GFP and Abp1 - DsRed localization , cells were visualized on a spinning disk confocal microscope ( Yokogawa ) equipped with a 100 (cid:6) NA - 1 . 4 objective and a cooled charge - coupled device camera ( Hamamatsu ) controlled by Metamorph software ( Universal Imaging ) . Image pairs from single optical sections scanned at 488 and 568 nm were collected every 1 . 8 s . Throughout , representative ﬁelds were shown and scales were constant within each ﬁgure . In vivo biochemical analyses . For the coisolation of Sjl2 or Sjl2 - myc with GFP - Abp1 , 20 OD 600 equivalents of cells were harvested , washed , sphero - plasted , and lysed in phosphate - buffered saline lysis buffer , consisting of 8 g of NaCl / liter , 0 . 2 g of KCl / liter , 1 . 44 g of Na 2 HPO 4 / liter , 0 . 24 g of KH 2 PO 4 / liter ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , the protease inhibitors aminoethyl - benzene sulfonyl ﬂuo - ride ( AEBSF ; Calbiochem ) , benzamidine , and pepstatin A , and a protease in - hibitor cocktail ( Complete ; Roche ) . Lysates were solubilized with 0 . 5 % Tween 20 ( Sigma ) by incubation on ice for 10 min . Samples were cleared by centrifu - gation at 13 , 000 (cid:6) g , and supernatants were processed to immunoisolate GFP or GFP - Abp1 by using anti - GFP antibodies ( provided by C . Zuker ) and protein A - Sepharose beads ( Pharmacia ) . Material was then visualized by Western blot - ting with either anti - Sjl2 or anti - myc ( Genosys , The Woodlands , Tex . ) antibodies . For sizing analysis of Sjl2 complexes in wild - type and abp1 (cid:3) cells , 100 OD 600 equivalents of cells were harvested , washed , and lysed in phosphate - buffered saline lysis buffer plus 1 % Triton X - 100 . Solubilized lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13 , 000 (cid:6) g and subsequently loaded onto a linear 10 to 40 % glycerol gradient equilibrated in lysis buffer plus 1 % Triton X - 100 . Samples containing cleared lysates or molecular weight standards ( aldolase , ferritin , and thyroglobulin ) were then subjected to centrifugation at 100 , 000 (cid:6) g for 4 h in an SW41 rotor . Fractions were then collected from the resulting gradients and analyzed by Western blotting with anti - Sjl2 antibodies . Sizing standards were detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( adolase ) , OD 280 absorbance ( adolase and thyroglobulin ) , and OD 420 absorbance ( ferritin ) . The ESCRT - I 350 - kDa complex was detected by using anti - Vps23 antibodies ( 2 ) . RESULTS Sjl2 localizes to cortical actin patches via its PRD domain . By virtue of its Sac1 - like PPIPase and 5 - Pase activities ( Fig . 1 ) , Sjl2 likely functions at multiple membrane sites in vivo in the control of PI isoforms [ e . g . , PI3P on endosomes , PI4P at the Golgi complex , and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the plasma membrane ] . To address its primary site of action , we examined the localization of Sjl2 by immunoﬂuorescence experiments . To do this , we generated polyclonal antisera against the PRD of Sjl2 . The antisera speciﬁcally recognized Sjl2 ; no signal was detected in sjl2 (cid:3) mutant cells ( Fig . 2A ) . Sjl2 was detected on many pe - ripheral or cortical punctate structures in wild - type cells ( Fig . 2A ) . Several of these structures concentrated in the bud and costained with rhodamine phalloidin , indicating that these Sjl2 - positive structures were cortical actin patches ( Fig . 2A , merge ) . Cortical actin patches have been implicated as sites of endocytic internalization in yeast ( 26 ) , in agreement with the known role of Sjl2 in endocytosis ( 44 , 48 ) . Additional puncta were observed that did not overlap with cortical actin patches ( Fig . 2A ) . Future studies will focus on the identiﬁcation of these Sjl2 - containing structures , such as the Golgi complex or endosomes , where Sjl2 function has also been implicated ( 4 , 21 , 48 ) . In order to rapidly detect Sjl2 localization in vivo , we fused GFP near the C terminus of Sjl2 . This fusion , Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP , lacked 37 C - terminal residues from Sjl2 ( see Materials and Methods ) . However , Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP was functional , as assessed by its ability to complement the growth defect of a mutant yeast strain lacking SJL1 , SJL2 , and SJL3 ( data not shown ) when expressed from its own promoter on a centromeric plas - mid . In agreement with our immunoﬂuorescence results , Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP was present on cortical structures that were con - centrated at sites of polarized growth , such as budding daugh - ter cells and the mother - daughter neck ( Fig . 2B , top , and 3A , top ) . Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP ﬂuorescence was also observed on intracel - lular puncta and diffusely localized in the cytoplasm . In FIG . 2 . Sjl2 localizes to cortical actin patches in a manner that requires actin ﬁlaments and the PRD of Sjl2 . ( A ) Wild - type ( SEY6210 . 1 ) and sjl2 (cid:3) ( YCS63 ) cells were observed by immunoﬂuo - rescent microscopy using anti - Sjl2 antibodies . Cells were costained with rhodamine - phalloidin ( actin ) and aligned with Nomarski optics ( merge ) . ( B ) Wild - type cells ( SEY6210 . 1 ) expressing Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP in the absence or presence of latrunculin A ( top and center , respectively ) or Sjl2 (cid:3) PRD - GFP ( bottom ) were observed by ﬂuorescent microscopy and aligned with Nomarski optics .

A previous study has shown that the PRD of Sjl2 is sufﬁcient for recruitment to nonpolarized actin ﬁlaments under hyper - osmotic stress conditions ( 39 ) . We examined whether this re - gion of Sjl2 was necessary for the recruitment of Sjl2 to cortical actin patches at the plasma membrane . We fused GFP to a truncated form of Sjl2 lacking 190 C - terminal residues ( Sjl2 (cid:3) PRD - GFP ) . This mutant form of Sjl2 was expressed at wild - type levels and at the predicted molecular weight , as de - termined by immunoblotting experiments ( data not shown ) . However , Sjl2 (cid:3) PRD - GFP localized diffusely throughout the cy - toplasm rather than on punctate structures ( Fig . 2B ) . Taken together , our results indicated that Sjl2 is recruited to cortical punctate structures and that this process requires ﬁlamentous actin and the PRD of Sjl2 . Abp1 is necessary for Sjl2 recruitment in vivo . Next , we searched for trans - acting factors that concentrate Sjl2 at corti - cal patches . Since the PRD was necessary for Sjl2 recruitment and SH3 domains bind proline - rich motifs , we examined roles for SH3 - containing proteins in the localization of Sjl2 at cor - tical actin patches . We identiﬁed the actin - binding protein Abp1 as necessary for Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP recruitment to cortical structures . In abp1 (cid:3) mutant cells , Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP localized dif - fusely throughout the cytoplasm ( Fig . 3A ) , a pattern similar to that of Sjl2 (cid:3) PRD - GFP expressed in wild - type cells . In contrast , the SH3 - containing proteins Sla1 and Rvs167 , which have re - cently been shown to interact biochemically with Sjl2 ( 47 ) , were not essential for Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP cortical recruitment ( Fig . 3A ) . However , cytoplasmic Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP ﬂuorescence ap - peared higher in rvs167 (cid:3) and sla1 (cid:3) cells than in wild - type cells . Thus , while multiple factors may be involved in targeting Sjl2 , our results have suggested an important role for Abp1 . A previous in vitro study used phage display to identify a proline - rich peptide ( PPVVKKP ) in the PRD of Sjl2 ( residues 1115 to 1121 ) as a possible binding site for the Abp1 SH3 domain ( 14 ) . To address whether these residues were involved in Sjl2 localization in vivo , we constructed a mutant form of Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP that bore substitutions in the 1115 PPVVKKP 1121 motif ( Fig . 3B ) . This mutant form of Sjl2 ( Sjl2 K1120V , P1121D , (cid:3) 37C - GFP ) was mislocalized to the cytoplasm of wild - type cells ( Fig . 3B ) , a pat - tern similar to the diffuse localization of wild - type Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP in abp1 (cid:3) cells . Altogether , our results suggested that Abp1 acts as a recruitment factor for Sjl2 and identiﬁed speciﬁc residues within the Sjl2 PRD important for Sjl2 localization , likely by direct as - sociation with the Abp1 SH3 domain . Sjl2 and Abp1 colocalize and physically interact in vivo . To examine whether Sjl2 colocalizes with Abp1 and to monitor the temporal relationship of these actin patch proteins , we coex - pressed Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP and a functional Abp1 - DsRed fusion protein ( 1 ) and imaged cells in real time by spinning disk confocal microscopy . Due to differences in the relative inten - sities of Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP and Abp1 - DsRed ﬂuorescence , Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP was expressed from a high - copy - number plasmid in these experiments . In agreement with our results indicating that Abp1 was necessary for Sjl2 cortical recruitment , signiﬁ - cant colocalization was observed between Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP and Abp1 - DsRed at cortical patches ( in four of seven Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP patches at the initial time point [ Fig . 4A ] ) . Closer exam - ination indicated that two additional Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP patches overlapped with faint Abp1 - DsRed ﬂuorescence ( Fig . 4A ) . More importantly , this analysis revealed an ordered sequence for the recruitment and disappearance of Sjl2 and Abp1 at cortical patches . Based on observations of more than 30 patches from several cells , Abp1 - DsRed appeared at patches prior to Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP , as Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP consistently concen - trated at preexisting Abp1 - DsRed patches . To demonstrate an example of this progression , a speciﬁc region in Fig . 4A was magniﬁed ( by 120 % ) and shown throughout the course of this experiment in Fig . 4B . Interestingly , the two proteins coexisted on patches only transiently , with Abp1 - DsRed disappearing from the patch rapidly after Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP recruitment ( Fig . 4B ) . In addition , Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP remained in patches following the disappearance of Abp1 - DsRed . For example , each of the Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP patches that initially colocalized with Abp1 - DsRed ( Fig . 4A ) persisted following the disappearance of Abp1 - DsRed . This process may explain the observation of Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP patches that did not appear to display signiﬁcant overlap with Abp1 - DsRed at the start of this experiment . Al - ternatively , Sjl2 may exist in a separate complex that transiently interacts with Abp1 patches . To further demonstrate a role for Abp1 in the recruitment of Sjl2 to cortical actin patches , we examined whether Abp1 and Sjl2 physically associate in vivo . Wild - type cells expressing GFP alone or functional GFP - Abp1 ( 9 ) were lysed . Next , GFP or GFP - Abp1 was immunoisolated from lysates solubilized under native conditions by using anti - GFP antibodies . Bound mate - rial was then probed for the presence of Sjl2 by using Sjl2 - speciﬁc antisera . Sjl2 copuriﬁed with GFP - Abp1 but not with GFP alone ( Fig . 5A ) . To address whether this interaction was mediated through the PRD of Sjl2 , GFP - Abp1 was immu - noisolated from cells expressing full - length Sjl2 - myc or a mu - tant form that lacked the PRD , Sjl2 (cid:3) PRD - myc . These experi - ments employed myc - tagged fusions , because the anti - Sjl2 antisera were directed against the PRD of Sjl2 . Sjl2 - myc copu - riﬁed with GFP - Abp1 but not with GFP alone ( Fig . 5B ) , results similar to those obtained using native Sjl2 . In contrast , Sjl2 (cid:3) PRD - myc did not copurify with GFP - Abp1 . Taken to - gether , these data indicated that Sjl2 and Abp1 associate in vivo and that this interaction occurs through the PRD of Sjl2 , in agreement with our ﬁndings that the PRD of Sjl2 and Abp1 direct the recruitment of Sjl2 to cortical patches in vivo . We further tested whether Abp1 and Sjl2 physically associ - ate in vivo by determining the relative molecular size of Sjl2 in extracts from wild - type and abp1 (cid:3) cells by using velocity gra - dient sedimentation analysis . In wild - type cell extracts , Sjl2 was present in fractions corresponding to a range of 440 to 669 kDa ( Fig . 6 ) . In extracts from abp1 (cid:3) cells , the proﬁle of Sjl2 was shifted to a lower - molecular - size range ( approximately 350 to 440 kDa [ Fig . 6 ] ) , consistent with our earlier result that Abp1 and Sjl2 interact . However , Sjl2 remained in a complex larger than its monomeric size ( approximately 120 kDa ) in abp1 (cid:3) cells , suggesting that additional factors associate with Sjl2 . In support of this idea , dual - color imaging of Sjl2 and Abp1 fusions indicated that Sjl2 - GFP persisted in cortical patches following the rapid movement or disappearance of Abp1 - DsRed from these patches ( Fig . 4 ) .

Abp1 and Sjl2 share similar functions in vivo . To further examine the role of the Abp1 - Sjl2 interaction , we investigated whether Abp1 was involved in Sjl2 function in vivo .

Because abp1 (cid:3) and sjl2 (cid:3) single - mutant cells display no obvious phenotypes , we com - pared phenotypes exhibited by sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) double - mutant cells with those of sjl1 (cid:3) abp1 (cid:3) double - mutant cells and found that they displayed similar properties . Cells lacking both SJL1 and SJL2 have been shown to accumulate abnormal , enlarged plasma membrane invaginations that fail to undergo ﬁssion and often fold around themselves to enclose portions of cyto - plasm ( 44 , 46 , 48 , 49 ) . These structures can be readily visual - ized by staining the membrane surfaces of sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) cells with the lipophilic dye FM4 - 64 under conditions that block endo - cytosis ( 0°C and metabolic inhibitors ) ( 44 ) . As expected , (cid:7) 90 % of sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) double - mutant cells displayed massive , furrow - like invaginations stained with FM4 - 64 that are contin - uous with the plasma membrane ( Fig . 7 ) . These invaginations displayed increased FM4 - 64 staining relative to the plasma membrane due to their double membrane structure and be - cause FM4 - 64 did not rapidly photobleach in these structures . Addition of FM4 - 64 to wild - type , sjl1 (cid:3) , and sjl2 (cid:3) cells under these conditions did not reveal the presence of any such cell surface structures ( Fig . 7 and data not shown ) . Likewise , abp1 (cid:3) mutant cells did not accumulate invaginations of the plasma membrane like those that form in sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) double - mutant cells . Interestingly , deletion of SJL1 and ABP1 in combination resulted in the formation of deep , furrow - like invaginations of the plasma membrane that were stably labeled with FM4 - 64 in (cid:7) 50 % of cells observed in these experiments ( Fig . 7 ) . Thus , sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) double - mutant cells and sjl1 (cid:3) abp1 (cid:3) double - mutant cells displayed similar phenotypes . Notably , abp1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) mu - tant cells did not accumulate the furrow - like plasma mem - brane structures that are present in sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) double - mutant cells ( Fig . 7 ) , suggesting that Sjl1 is recruited by a different mechanism . Previous studies have shown that sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) double mutants display defects in endocytic internalization , while sjl1 (cid:3) , sjl2 (cid:3) , or abp1 (cid:3) single - mutant cells do not ( 24 , 44 ) . Thus , we exam - ined whether sjl1 (cid:3) abp1 (cid:3) double - mutant cells displayed endo - cytic defects similar to those of sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) double - mutant cells . To do this , we monitored the internalization and transport of the lipophilic dye FM4 - 64 to the vacuole . Cells were pulse - labeled with FM4 - 64 and CMAC ( a vital dye that accumulates in the vacuole lumen ) , washed , and chased in a medium that did not contain FM4 - 64 or CMAC . As expected , wild - type and abp1 (cid:3) mutant cells displayed FM4 - 64 ﬂuorescence only in vacuole membranes or late endosomal compartments adjacent to vacuoles following a 30 - minute chase ( Fig . 8 ) . Likewise , (cid:7) 80 % of sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) double - mutant cells expressing Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP from a plasmid delivered FM4 - 64 to vacuole membranes or compartments adjacent to vacuoles within the chase period ( Fig . 8 , sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP ) . In contrast , sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) double - mutant cells displayed defects in delivery of FM4 - 64 to the vacuole . FM4 - 64 ﬂuorescence was observed in structures that were distinct from vacuoles , possibly corresponding to cell surface invaginations ( Fig . 8 ) . Interestingly , sjl1 (cid:3) abp1 (cid:3) double - mutant cells displayed a delay in endocytic trafﬁck - ing to vacuoles ; FM4 - 64 was found in peripheral structures in (cid:7) 50 % of these cells ( Fig . 8 ) . We also expressed Sjl2 K1120V , P1121D , (cid:3) 37C - GFP in cells lacking SJL1 and SJL2 and found FM4 - 64 in peripheral structures in (cid:7) 40 % of these cells ( Fig . 8 , sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 KP , VD , (cid:3) 37C - GFP ) . Together , these results fur - ther implicate Abp1 in endocytosis and suggest that the pre - dicted Abp1 binding site in Sjl2 is necessary for full Sjl2 func - tion in the endocytic pathway .

Samples containing either cleared lysates or mo - lecular weight standards were loaded onto a linear 10 to 40 % glycerol gradient equilibrated in lysis buffer plus 1 % Triton X - 100 and were subjected to centrifugation at 100 , 000 (cid:6) g . Fractions were collected from the resulting gradients and analyzed by Western blotting with anti - Sjl2 antibodies ( upper panels ) . Fractions containing sizing stan - dards are indicated .

Actin polymerization has been proposed to mediate endocytic internalization and motility of actin patch compo - nents ( 26 ) . Phosphoinositides , particularly PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , have been implicated in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton ( 54 ) . Thus , we examined whether actin polymerization is re - quired for the formation of extensive plasma membrane in - vaginations in Sjl - deﬁcient cells . To perform these experi - ments , we utilized strains lacking SJL1 and SJL3 that expressed either wild - type SJL2 or a temperature - conditional sjl2 ts allele . We have previously shown that sjl2 ts cells display endocytic defects and accumulate abnormal plasma membrane invagina - tions upon prolonged incubation at the restrictive temperature ( 48 ) ( see Fig . S1 in the supplemental material ) . SJL2 and sjl2 ts cells were grown at the permissive temperature and then shifted to the nonpermissive temperature for 90 min in the absence or presence of latrunculin A . Cells were then labeled with FM4 - 64 under conditions that block endocytosis in order to visualize the plasma membrane . Upon extended incubation at the nonpermissive temperature , (cid:7) 80 % of untreated sjl2 ts cells accumulated enlarged plasma membrane invaginations stained with FM4 - 64 , consistent with our previous results ( Fig . 9A ) . In contrast , cells expressing wild - type SJL2 displayed nor - mal plasma membrane morphology , both in the absence and in the presence of latrunculin A ( Fig . 9A and data not shown ) . To determine whether the abnormal cell surface morphology ob - served in sjl2 ts mutant cells was due to continued actin poly - merization , we pretreated sjl2 ts cells with latrunculin A prior to the shift to the restrictive temperature . Interestingly , extensive , furrow - like plasma membrane structures did not form in (cid:7) 90 % of sjl2 ts cells treated with latrunculin A at the nonper - missive temperature ( Fig . 9A ) . We did observe regions of the plasma membrane with more - intense FM4 - 64 staining ; how - ever , these regions did not form the extensive invaginations that characteristically accumulate in sjl2 ts or sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) mutant cells . Thus , actin polymerization was necessary for the forma - tion of large invaginations of the plasma membrane in sjl2 ts mutant cells . Sla2 is mislocalized in cells with impaired synaptojanin activity . We have previously reported that the inappropriate accumulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on intracellular compartments in sjl2 ts mutant cells at the restrictive temperature correlated with defects in actin organization , plasma membrane morphology , and endocytosis ( 48 ) . We therefore wished to identify potential PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 downstream effector proteins that may become lim - iting at the plasma membrane in sjl2 ts mutant cells . Sla2 , the yeast ortholog of mammalian Hip1 - related protein ( Hip1R ) , was a particularly interesting candidate . Sla2 and mammalian Hip1R possess an N - terminal ANTH domain , a central coiled region , and a C - terminal talin - like domain ( Fig . 9B ) . ENTH / ANTH domains from several endocytic proteins , such as epsin and AP180 , have been shown to bind PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in vitro ( 15 , 25 ) . A previous study has shown that Sla2p can bind the clath - rin light chain through its central region ( 23 ) . Likewise , the Sla2p homologs Hip1 and Hip1R have been shown to bind clathrin , AP - 2 , and F - actin ( 10 , 11 , 30 , 38 ) . The C - terminal talin - like domain of Sla2 has been shown to bind F - actin in vitro ( 35 , 36 ) and was sufﬁcient for localization to actin patches in vivo ( 53 ) . Accordingly , Sla2 / Hip1R proteins have been pro - posed to link actin and clathrin coat components during endo - cytosis . FIG . 7 . Deletion of ABP1 confers phenotypes similar to that of cells lacking Sjl2 . The following strains were made nonviable by the addition of NaN 3 and NaF to inhibit internalization from the plasma membrane : the wild - type ( SEY6210 . 1 ) , sjl1 (cid:3) ( YCS62 ) , sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) ( YCS66 ) , abp1 (cid:3) ( YCS301 ) , sjl1 (cid:3) abp1 (cid:3) ( YCS323 ) , and abp1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) ( YCS327 ) strains . Cells were then stained with FM4 - 64 at 0°C as described previously ( 48 ) and observed by ﬂuorescent microscopy us - ing a Delta Vision system . The invaginations in sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) and sjl1 (cid:3) abp1 (cid:3) cells displayed increased FM4 - 64 staining relative to that of the plasma membrane due to their folded structure and the fact that FM4 - 64 did not rapidly photobleach in these structures .

Thus , SLA2 was expressed from a high - copy - number plasmid in SJL2 and sjl2 ts cells grown at the permissive temperature . Cells were then shifted to the nonpermissive temperature for 90 min and subsequently labeled with FM4 - 64 under condi - tions that block endocytosis in order to visualize the plasma membrane . Expression of SLA2 from a high - copy - number plasmid had no effect on plasma membrane morphology in SJL2 cells ( data not shown ) . As expected , (cid:7) 80 % of sjl2 ts cells carrying vector alone accumulated enlarged plasma membrane invaginations stained with FM4 - 64 upon extended incubation at the nonpermissive temperature ( Fig . 9B ) . Notably , ex - tended , furrow - like plasma membrane structures did not form in (cid:7) 70 % of sjl2 ts cells overexpressing SLA2 ( Fig . 9B ) . We did observe punctate structures at the plasma membrane with FM4 - 64 staining ; however , these regions did not develop into the deep invaginations that form in sjl2 ts cells . Next , we addressed whether overexpression of Sla2 might rescue endocytic trafﬁcking defects in sjl2 ts cells . To do this , we monitored the transport of FM4 - 64 to the vacuole in SJL2 and sjl2 ts cells expressing SLA2 from a high - copy - number plasmid following incubation at the restrictive temperature . After a 30 - min chase , FM4 - 64 ﬂuorescence was efﬁciently delivered to the vacuole membrane in SJL2 cells carrying either vector alone or the SLA2 plasmid ( Fig . 10 ) . As expected , sjl2 ts cells displayed defects in delivery of FM4 - 64 to the vacuole , since FM4 - 64 ﬂuorescence was observed in punctate structures that were distinct from vacuoles ( Fig . 10 ) . Interestingly , expression of SLA2 from a high - copy - number plasmid increased the rate of endocytic trafﬁcking to the vacuole in sjl2 ts cells , as FM4 - 64 efﬁciently labeled the vacuole membrane in (cid:7) 75 % of these cells ( Fig . 10 ) . Together , these results suggested that Sla2 func - tion was limiting or misregulated in sjl2 ts cells at the nonper - missive temperature . Thus , we examined the localization of a functional Sla2 - GFP fusion in wild - type and sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) double - mutant cells . Cells lacking SJL1 and SJL2 have been reported to display defects in actin organization and endocytic internalization ( 44 , 46 ) . In wild - type cells , Sla2 - GFP was observed at cortical patches con - centrated in the bud , a pattern similar to previously published patterns of Sla2 localization at cortical actin patches ( 53 ) ( Fig . 11A ) . However , in sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) mutant cells , Sla2 - GFP displayed random distribution in both mother and daughter cells and was no longer strictly cortical ( Fig . 11A ) . We also addressed whether Sla2 localized to the plasma membrane furrows that accumulate in sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) cells . To do this , we labeled the plasma membranes of sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) double - mutant cells express - ing Sla2 - GFP with FM4 - 64 under conditions that block endo - cytosis ( 0°C and metabolic inhibitors ) . We did not observe signiﬁcant overlap between FM4 - 64 and Sla2 - GFP ﬂuores - cence in these cells ( see Fig . S2 in the supplemental material ) , consistent with the idea that Sla2 might be limiting at sites of endocytic internalization in sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) mutant cells . Yeast cells that lack Sla2 and mammalian cells depleted of Hip1R have been shown to accumulate comet - like actin tails at sites of endocytic internalization ( 12 , 26 ) . We therefore exam - ined whether sla2 (cid:3) mutant cells form plasma membrane in - vaginations similar to those of sjl2 ts or sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) mutant cells . Thus , wild - type and sla2 (cid:3) cells were stained with FM4 - 64 un - der conditions that block endocytosis , as before . As expected , wild - type cells displayed normal plasma membrane morphol - ogy ( Fig . 11B ) . Interestingly , (cid:7) 75 % of sla2 (cid:3) cells displayed multiple punctate plasma membrane structures stained with FM4 - 64 ( Fig . 11B ) . While these structures did not appear to be as extensive as the invaginations that form in sjl2 ts or sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) cells , these results suggested that sla2 (cid:3) mutant cells accumu - FIG . 9 .

Taken together , our re - sults have suggested that Sla2 becomes misregulated or limit - ing at the plasma membrane in cells with impaired SJL - encoded PI Pase activity , which may subsequently result in inefﬁcient membrane ﬁssion or scission during endocytic inter - nalization . DISCUSSION We have shown that Sjl2 localizes to cortical actin patches and that this localization depended on the PRD of Sjl2 , actin ﬁlaments , and the actin patch component Abp1 . Previous stud - ies have indicated that elevated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels in cells lacking SJL - encoded PI 5 - Pase activity cause defects in actin ﬁlament organization ( 39 , 48 ) . Here , we have shown that actin ﬁlaments were necessary for the formation of extensive plasma mem - brane invaginations in sjl2 ts mutant cells , suggesting that mis - regulated actin polymerization may lead to defects in proper ﬁssion and release of endocytic vesicle intermediates . Finally , our studies have indicated that overexpression of the actin patch protein Sla2 partially rescued the endocytic and plasma membrane morphology defects observed in sjl2 ts mutant cells . Sjl2 colocalizes with Abp1 . Several lines of evidence indicate that Sjl2 and Abp1 function at the same site in the control of endocytosis . Both Abp1 and Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP are recruited to actin patches in a latrunculin - sensitive manner ( Fig . 2B ) ( 26 ) . In abp1 (cid:3) mutant cells , Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP localizes diffusely throughout the cytoplasm ( Fig . 3A ) . The PRD of Sjl2 is nec - essary for the recruitment of Sjl2 to cortical actin patches and for physical association with Abp1 ( Fig . 2B and 5 ) . Thus , our results provide in vivo evidence that Abp1 acts as an adaptor for Sjl2 at actin patches via the PRD of Sjl2 . Deletion of SJL2 FIG . 10 . SLA2 overexpression increases endocytic rates in sjl2 ts cells .

Notably , abp1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) mutant cells do not display defects in plasma membrane morphology or actin cytoskeletal organization ( Fig . 7 and our unpublished data ) , unlike sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) or sjl2 (cid:3) sjl3 (cid:3) mutant cells ( 44 , 46 ) . Thus , Abp1 appears to speciﬁcally recruit Sjl2 at cortical actin patches , but not Sjl1 or Sjl3 . Further studies are needed to identify Sjl1 - and Sjl3 - speciﬁc targeting factors . Abp1 is recruited to actin patches at a late step during endocytic internalization and then rapidly moves away from the plasma membrane ( 26 ) . Consistent with a role for Sjl2 during late stages of vesicle ﬁssion and uncoating , Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP concentrates at preexisting Abp1 cortical patches , and Abp1 disappears from patches shortly following Sjl2 recruit - ment ( Fig . 4 ) . Previous studies indicate that Abp1 also inter - acts with several other components of actin patches , including the Arp2 / 3 complex , the yeast amphiphysin ortholog Rvs167 ( see below ) , the type I myosin Myo3 , and the kinases Ark1 / Prk1 ( 6 , 14 , 19 , 32 ) . It is not likely that Abp1 binds to these factors simultaneously . So then , how are multiple Abp1 inter - actions selectively coordinated at actin patches ? One possible explanation comes from previous studies indicating that mam - malian synaptojanin is a member of the dephosphin family of endocytic proteins , which also includes dynamin , AP180 , en - dophilin , and amphiphysin ; these proteins associate with each other only following Ca 2 (cid:1) - stimulated dephosphorylation ( 29 , 45 ) . Thus , a complex series of phosphorylation and dephos - phorylation events may regulate the recognition by Abp1 of various targets during late events in endocytic internalization . Sjl2 might be dephosphorylated temporally later than other Abp1 targets , thus avoiding premature termination of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - mediated vesicle formation events . Further studies are needed to examine whether Sjl2 is regulated by phosphor - ylation - dephosphorylation and , if so , to identify the relevant kinases and phosphatases . Our studies also indicated that multiple Sjl2 - interacting fac - tors exist , analogous to the complex interactions that control the localization and activity of mammalian synaptojanins . First , we found that Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP persisted in cortical patches fol - lowing the disappearance of Abp1 - DsRed ( Fig . 4 ) . In addition , our sizing analysis indicated that Sjl2 remained in a complex larger than its predicted monomeric size in lysates from abp1 (cid:3) cells ( Fig . 6 ) . Recent studies have shown that Sjl2 physically associates with two other SH3 domain - containing proteins , Rvs167 and Sla1 , and another protein , Bsp1 ( 47 , 52 ) . Rvs167 is the yeast amphiphysin ortholog ; thus , the association of Sjl2 with Rvs167 is consistent with the known interaction between amphiphysin and mammalian synaptojanin ( 5 , 45 ) . Likewise , a recent study has indicated that the mammalian homolog of Sla1 , CIN85 , physically associates with synaptojanin 2 ( 28 ) . Bsp1 was identiﬁed as a cortical actin patch protein that inter - acts with the Sac1 domains of Sjl2 and Sjl3 ( 47 ) . Sla1 , Rvs167 , and Bsp1 may act as additional recruitment or speciﬁcity fac - tors for Sjl2 localization or regulation ( see Fig . 12 ) , consistent with our genetic results indicating that sjl1 (cid:3) abp1 (cid:3) mutant cells did not fully phenocopy sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) mutant cells . While our initial Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP localization experiments suggested that Sla1 , Rvs167 , and Bsp1 were not essential for Sjl2 local - ization at cortical patches ( Fig . 3 and data not shown ) , these proteins may inﬂuence the stability or lifetime of Sjl2 at cor - tical patches . Our study has not excluded the possibility that residues deleted in Sjl2 (cid:3) 37C - GFP provide important interac - tions with Sla1 or Rvs167 , for example , that direct Sjl2 local - ization along with Abp1 . Alternatively , Sjl2 may exist in a stable subcomplex that transiently interacts with Abp1 patches . FIG . 11 . ( A ) Proper localization of Sla2 at cortical patches is de - pendent on Sjl1 and Sjl2 . Localization of Sla2 - GFP in living wild - type ( YCS284 ) and sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) ( YCS374 ) cells was observed by ﬂuorescence ( Sla2 - GFP ) and Normarski ( merge ) microscopy . ( B ) Deletion of SLA2 confers abnormal plasma membrane dynamics . Wild - type ( SEY6210 . 1 ) and sla2 (cid:3) ( YCS358 ) cells were made nonviable by the addition of NaN 3 and NaF to inhibit internalization from the plasma membrane . Cells were then stained with FM4 - 64 at 0°C as described previously ( 48 ) and observed by ﬂuorescent microscopy ( FM4 - 64 ) and Nomarski optics ( merge ) . Bars , 5 (cid:5) M . 2920 STEFAN ET AL .

Thus , further experiments will be necessary to examine the temporal and spatial recruitment of Sjl2 relative to additional actin patch components such as Sla1 , Rvs167 , and Bsp1 . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 turnover regulates the timing of plasma mem - brane invagination and ﬁssion events during endocytic inter - nalization . Previous studies have shown that synaptojanins are necessary for the postﬁssion uncoating of adaptor proteins from newly formed endocytic vesicles ( 7 , 22 , 51 ) . Consistent with this , sjl2 ts cells have been shown to accumulate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in intracellular compartments at the restrictive temperature ( 48 ) . However , if the single function for synaptojanins during endocytosis is to recycle PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - regulated vesicle formation factors from endosomes , subsequent rounds of internalization may not proceed in synaptojanin - deﬁcient cells . Strikingly , our studies and previous studies have indicated that sjl2 ts and sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) cells accumulate numerous , extensive plasma membrane invaginations ( 44 , 48 ) . At the ultrastructural level , the cyto - plasmic face of these invaginations appeared to be lined by an electron - dense “coat” - like material . In addition , a clearing or electron - transparent region was often observed at the tips of the invaginations ( see Fig . S1B in the supplemental material ) . Further experiments are needed to determine whether these are components of clathrin coats and the actin polymerization machinery . Regardless , these examinations have suggested that vesicle formation factors may not become limiting in Sjl - deﬁcient cells and that multiple internalization events can ini - tiate . Rather , these ﬁndings have indicated that reduced SJL - encoded PI Pase function leads to increased growth of plasma membrane invaginations . Thus , factors important for promot - ing vesicle scission may be limiting or impaired in cells deﬁ - cient in SJL - encoded PI Pase activity . Several lines of evidence suggested that Sla2 , the Hip1R homolog shown to associate with the actin cytoskeleton and components of clathrin coats , becomes limiting at the plasma membrane in sjl mutant cells . First , Sla2 - GFP was mislocalized in sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) mutant cells . More importantly , SLA2 overex - pression attenuated the formation of the large plasma mem - brane invaginations that accumulate in sjl2 ts cells ( Fig . 9 ) . We found that overexpression of another ANTH domain - contain - ing endocytic protein , yAP180a , or the PH domain from PLC (cid:8) , as a control , did not rescue the plasma membrane morphology defects in sjl2 ts cells ( data not shown ) . Thus , suppression was not simply due to sequestration of excess cellular PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Furthermore , SLA2 overexpression rescued the endocytic de - fects displayed by sjl2 ts cells , as assessed by monitoring of the internalization and delivery of FM4 - 64 to the vacuole ( Fig . 10 ) . Previous studies have shown that deletion of SLA2 in yeast and depletion of Hip1R in mammalian cells resulted in the formation of comet - like actin tails associated with endocytic FIG . 12 . Model for Sjl2 recruitment and function during endocytic internalization . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis by the PI ( 4 ) P 5 - kinase Mss4 recruits effector proteins that promote actin polymerization ( red cables ) , clathrin coat formation ( brown ovals ) , and vesicle budding ( step 1 ) . The SH3 domain - containing protein Abp1 is recruited at a late stage during vesicle formation ( 26 ) and subsequently recruits Sjl2 . Additional Sjl2 - interacting factors , such as the SH3 domain - containing proteins Rvs167 and Sla1 ( 47 ) , may also target Sjl2 to actin patches . Following Abp1 recruitment , certain actin patch components , such as the ANTH domain - containing protein Sla2 , disassociate from patches ( indicated by dashed arrows ) ( 26 ) . Concentration of Sjl2 at patches by Abp1 may serve an important role in this process . Turnover of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the plasma membrane by Sjl1 and Sjl2 provides an important step in coordinating actin polymerization and vesicle ﬁssion ( step 2 ) ; cells lacking SJL1 and SJL2 accumulate extensive endocytic intermediates . Synaptojanins , such as Sjl2 and Sjl3 , also dephosphorylate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on newly formed vesicles to recycle or uncoat PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding factors , such as actin patch components and clathrin coat proteins ( step 3 ) . V OL . 25 , 2005 Abp1 RECRUITS Sjl2 TO THE PLASMA MEMBRANE 2921 on M a r c h 27 , 2013 b y gue s t h tt p : / / m c b . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m cargo and machinery ( 12 , 26 ) . In addition , sla2 mutations have been shown to cause the formation of large , aggregated actin patches or clumps ( 3 , 53 ) . These studies have indicated that Sla2 regulates actin cytoskeletal dynamics at cortical actin patches by destabilizing actin ﬁlaments or by negatively regu - lating the Arp2 / 3 actin polymerization complex or its activa - tors . Thus , mislocalization of Sla2 in Sjl - deﬁcient cells may cause increased actin polymerization and defects in productive clathrin coat formation , ultimately leading to continued or extended growth of plasma membrane invaginations . Consis - tent with this idea , actin polymerization was necessary for the formation of extensive plasma membrane invaginations in sjl2 ts cells ( Fig . 9 ) . However , the punctate structures at the plasma membrane in sla2 (cid:3) cells ( Fig . 11 ) were not nearly as extensive as the furrow - like invaginations that form in cells lacking SJL1 and SJL2 . Thus , additional PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 effector proteins are likely to be misregulated and to contribute to the dramatic effects on plasma membrane and actin cytoskeleton dynamics observed in Sjl - deﬁcient cells . Consistent with this , overexpres - sion of SLA2 was not sufﬁcient to bypass the growth defect of sjl2 ts cells at the restrictive temperature ( data not shown ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 has been shown to stimulate actin polymerization by binding several actin - regulatory proteins , such as WASP , coﬁlin , gelsolin , and capping proteins ( 54 ) . Thus , increased PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels at the plasma membrane in Sjl1 / 2 - deﬁcient cells may also enhance cortical actin ﬁlament growth and sta - bility , leading in turn to additive effects on proper ﬁssion and release of endocytic vesicles ( see Fig . 12 ) . Consistent with this idea , we have previously shown that increased cellular PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels directly affect plasma membrane dynamics and actin organization , since sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) mss4 ts triple - mutant cells , which synthesize normal PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels , do not display ab - normal plasma membrane furrows or depolarized actin patches such as those seen in sjl1 (cid:3) sjl2 (cid:3) double - mutant cells ( 48 ) . In yeast , at least three actin patch components , Las17 ( a WASP ortholog ) , Pan1 ( an Eps15 ortholog ) , and Abp1 , have been shown to be activators of the Arp2 / 3 complex that medi - ates actin polymerization ( 18 ) . Interestingly , Abp1 is recruited to actin patches temporally later than Las17 and Pan1 ( 26 ) . Furthermore , Las17 and Pan1 were shown to disassociate or disappear from actin patches upon Abp1 recruitment ( 26 ) . Thus , a late role for Abp1 in recruiting Sjl2 to endocytic ves - icles may be to terminate earlier PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - dependent stages of vesicle formation mediated by Las17 or Pan1 . Alternatively , Sjl2 may be recruited to actin patches by Abp1 to regulate Abp1 function itself . Interestingly , disappearance or dissocia - tion of cortical Abp1 consistently occurred following Sjl2 re - cruitment ( Fig . 4 ) . Further experiments that examine the spa - tial and temporal relationships of known actin patch proteins in cells with impaired Sjl1 , Sjl2 , and Sjl3 activity may provide further insights that allow us to distinguish between these po - tential models . Likewise , further studies are necessary to identify additional regulatory factors for Sjl1 , Sjl2 , and Sjl3 . Each contains unique targeting signals , and thus , speciﬁc recruitment and activation mechanisms for these proteins must exist . Further studies may uncover specialized roles for these PI phosphatases within the ordered processes of membrane invagination , actin cytoskel - etal dynamics , vesicle scission , and subsequent uncoating events that occur during endocytosis .
