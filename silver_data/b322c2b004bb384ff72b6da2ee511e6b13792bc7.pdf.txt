Levin , Princeton University , Princeton , NJ , and approved October 16 , 2018 ( received for review June 27 , 2018 ) The basic reproduction number is one of the conceptual corner - stones of mathematical epidemiology . Its classical deﬁnition as the number of secondary cases generated by a typical infected individual in a fully susceptible population ﬁnds a clear analytical expression in homogeneous and stratiﬁed mixing models . Along with the generation time ( the interval between primary and secondary cases ) , the reproduction number allows for the charac - terization of the dynamics of an epidemic . A clear - cut theoretical picture , however , is hardly found in real data . Here , we infer from highly detailed sociodemographic data two multiplex con - tact networks representative of a subset of the Italian and Dutch populations . We then simulate an infection transmission process on these networks accounting for the natural history of inﬂuenza and calibrated on empirical epidemiological data . We explicitly measure the reproduction number and generation time , record - ing all individual - level transmission events . We ﬁnd that the classical concept of the basic reproduction number is untenable in realistic populations , and it does not provide any conceptual understanding of the epidemic evolution . This departure from the classical theoretical picture is not due to behavioral changes and other exogenous epidemiological determinants . Rather , it can be simply explained by the ( clustered ) contact structure of the pop - ulation . Finally , we provide evidence that methodologies aimed at estimating the instantaneous reproduction number can oper - ationally be used to characterize the correct epidemic dynamics from incidence data . computational modeling | infectious diseases | multiplex networks | reproduction number | generation time M athematical and computational models of infectious dis - eases are increasingly recognized as relevant quantitative support to epidemic preparedness and response ( 1 – 3 ) . Indepen - dent of the type of modeling approach , our understanding of epidemic models is generally tied to two fundamental concepts . One is the basic reproduction number R 0 , which is the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical infectious indi - vidual over the entire course of the infectious period in a fully susceptible population ( 4 ) . The other is the generation time Tg , the time interval between the infection time of the infector and her / his infectees ( 5 , 6 ) . These quantities are the cornerstones of our understanding of basic epidemic models , as they encom - pass the condition for the occurrence of an epidemic outbreak ( R 0 > 1 ) and the epidemic doubling time . Both the reproduction number and generation time are determined by the biological characteristics of the pathogen ( e . g . , probability of transmission given a contact ) , the pathogen – host system ( e . g . , timeline of pathogen replication inside the host ) , and the contact patterns of the population in which the infection spreads ( 4 , 7 ) . The concept of the reproduction number has been extended to stratiﬁed mod - els ( 8 ) and to heterogeneous contact networks ( 9 ) to account for more complex interaction patterns . Furthermore , the deﬁnition of R 0 has been generalized by the effective reproduction number R ( t ) ( i . e . , the average number of secondary cases generated by an infectious individual at time t ) , thus relaxing the hypothesis of a fully susceptible population ( 10 ) . R 0 and Tg are mathematically well deﬁned in the early stages of the epidemic in homogeneous models and are widely used in predictive approaches ( 10 , 11 ) . However , several studies have cautioned on the importance of the local contact structures ( e . g . , households , extended families , communities ) in estimat - ing the value of R 0 ( 12 – 17 ) . Theoretical work has explored the deﬁnition of the reproduction number in models entailing community and household structure ( 18 – 24 ) , although an oper - ational way to compute R 0 is still lacking . For more complex models closely resembling the actual structure of the human pop - ulations ( e . g . , accounting for households , schools , workplaces ) ( 25 – 34 ) , the estimation of R 0 mainly relied on the direct count of secondary cases generated by the index case of the outbreak ( R index 0 ) and / or the analysis of the growth rate of the simulated epidemics . However , both methods have limitations and show marked differences in the estimated values ( 31 , 32 ) . Indeed , R index 0 is computed from the analysis of the index case of an outbreak , which is not necessarily representative of a “typi - cal” infectious individual . In addition to this , growing evidence shows that the classic exponential early growth of the epidemic is an oversimpliﬁcation often not backed by real - world data ( 35 , 36 ) . For this reason , statistical methods were developed for the analysis of R ( t ) , assuming that the variations of this quantity are mostly due to the impact of the performed intervention strategies and behavioral changes in the population ( 10 , 16 , 17 , 37 ) . Unfortunately , for these methods , disentangling the role of Signiﬁcance The analysis of real epidemiological data has raised issues of the adequacy of the classic homogeneous modeling frame - work and quantities , such as the basic reproduction number in real - world situations . Based on high - quality sociodemo - graphic data , here we generate a multiplex network describ - ing the contact pattern of the Italian and Dutch populations . By using a microsimulation approach , we show that , for epidemics spreading on realistic contact networks , it is not possible to deﬁne a steady exponential growth phase and a basic reproduction number . We show the operational use of the instantaneous reproduction rate as a good descriptor of the transmission dynamics . Author contributions : Q . - H . L . , M . A . , A . A . , S . M . , Y .

In summary , a clear operational way to compute R is still lacking , and no predictive modeling studies have thus far focused on the harder task of analyzing the dynamics of the reproduction number over time . Here , we study the very deﬁnition and measurability of R 0 , R ( t ) , and Tg with data - driven microsimulation models of the infection transmission process based on a highly detailed syn - thetic population of agents , where we can have complete access to microlevel data ( e . g . , keeping track of all interactions of the simulated agents and the entire transmission chain ) ( 25 – 30 ) . Namely , we consider an infection transmission model where the pathogen spreads on two high - resolution synthetic multiplex contact networks inferred from real - world sociodemographic data . We simulated the progression of a simple inﬂuenza trans - mission model accounting for the natural history of the disease and calibrated to match empirical epidemiological data on the inferred multiplex networks . We measure basic quantities , such as R 0 , R ( t ) , and Tg , and show that the heterogeneity and cluster - ing of human contact patterns ( e . g . , contacts between household members , classmates , work colleagues ) determine a nontrivial variability of R ( t ) and Tg ( t ) . This evidence , contrasted with the results from null models , highlights the challenges in measuring R 0 and Tg in real - world systems . This raises questions about the adequacy of their deﬁnitions given the complex temporal dynamics of R ( t ) and Tg ( t ) , both of which highly deviate from the classical theory . Our study suggests that epidemic inﬂection points , often ascribed to behavioral changes or control strategies , could also be explained by the natural contact structure of the population . Finally , we show that Bayesian analyses of the instan - taneous reproduction number over time represent valuable tools for understanding complex epidemic dynamics , provided that reliable estimates of Tg are available . Results We use detailed sociodemographic data to generate two multi - plex networks describing the contact patterns of about 500 , 000 agents , each representative of a subset of the Italian and Dutch populations ( Materials and Methods discusses the methodology ) . The effective contacts through which the infection can spread are determined by the copresence of two individuals in the same settings . This effectively deﬁnes a weighted multiplex network ( 38 – 40 ) made by four layers representing the network of contacts between household members , schoolmates , work colleagues , and casual encounters in the general community ( Fig . 1 A ) ( 15 , 26 , 34 , 41 , 42 ) . Each node in the household layer represents one individual of the real population and is linked only to the other nodes representing members of her / his own household . A second layer represents contacts in school ( i . e . , every node represents one student or teacher and has contact only with other individu - als attending / working in the same school ) . A third layer accounts for contacts in workplaces , and a fourth layer encodes contacts in the community , where we assume a complete network [ i . e . , each individual has a certain ( low ) probability of infecting any other individual of the population ] . The four layers are characterized by remarkably different degree distributions ( Fig . 1 B ) . This rep - resentation of links between individuals readily highlights the typical strong clustering of human populations , where individuals tend to meet the same set of contacts ( e . g . , household members , schoolmates , colleagues ) on a regular basis ( 43 – 45 ) . The inﬂuenza - like transmission dynamics are deﬁned through a susceptible , infectious , removed ( SIR ) scheme ( Fig . 1 C ) . Ess - entially , susceptible individuals can acquire the infection through contacts with infectious individuals , and as soon as they are infected , they proceed to the infectious stage . Infectious indi - viduals then move to the removed compartment according to a Fig . 1 . Model structure .

I , infectious ; R , removed ; S , susceptible . removal rate [ such that an infectious individual spends an expo - nential amount of time ( the removal time or infectious period ) in the infectious stage before recovering ] . We keep the transmis - sion scheme as simple as possible ( e . g . , avoiding the introduction of other classes , such as a latent compartment , the distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals , hospital - ized individuals , and so on ) to avoid confounding effects . Of course , more reﬁned models are needed to answer complex questions , such as the impact of control strategies . We simulate the transmission dynamics as a stochastic process for each speciﬁc individual , each with her / his own characteris - tics ( e . g . , age , individual infectiousness , membership to a speciﬁc household or school , and so on ) , and accounting for the cluster - ing of contacts typical of human populations . For instance , an agent can transmit the infection in a given school only if she / he studies or works there . In each layer , the infection transmission between nodes is calibrated in such a way that the fractions of cases in the four layers are in agreement with literature values ( namely , 30 % of all inﬂuenza infections are linked to transmis - sion occurring in the household setting , 18 % of all inﬂuenza infections are linked to transmission occurring in schools , 19 % of all inﬂuenza infections are linked to transmission occurring in workplaces , and 33 % of all inﬂuenza infections are linked to transmission occurring in the community ) ( 26 , 27 , 33 ) . Moreover , we set these layer - speciﬁc transmission rates such that the repro - duction number of the index case ( R index 0 ) is 1 . 3 [ in agreement with typical values reported for inﬂuenza in the literature ( 46 ) ] . Liu et al . PNAS | December 11 , 2018 | vol . 115 | no . 50 | 12681 Finally , without loss of generality , we ﬁx the removal time to 3 d ( 15 , 47 , 48 ) . In SI Appendix , we report all of the details of the transmis - sion model ( SI Appendix , section 1 . 1 ) . In the text , we also report the corresponding analysis of R ( t ) and Tg ( t ) for a stochastic implementation of a homogeneous mixing SIR model at the indi - vidual level , where all individuals are identical and are in contact with the same ﬁxed probability . Along with the homogeneous SIR model , we also studied a set of alternative null models with an increasing level of complexity from the homogeneous model to the data - driven model ( details are in SI Appendix , sections 1 . 2 – 1 . 5 ) . Null models include annealed ( edges are constantly rewired ) and quenched ( edges are ﬁxed over time ) conﬁgura - tion models . Results reported in the text refer to the synthetic population for Italy . Effective Reproduction Number and Generation Time . The ﬁrst quantities generally investigated in epidemic models are the inci - dence ( of new infections ) as a function of time and the associated growth rate of the epidemic . In homogeneous models , the num - ber of new cases increases exponentially at a nearly constant rate r ( 5 , 49 , 50 ) during the early phase of the epidemic . This is not the case in the data - driven model , where we ﬁnd a non - monotonous behavior : an increasing trend over the initial phase of the epidemic occurs followed by a marked decrease about 20 d before the epidemic peak ( Fig . 2 A ) . Such a result is in sharp contrast with the classic theory , where the epidemic growth rate is expected to slowly and monotonically decrease over time in the early epidemic phase ( Fig . 2 A ) . This suggests that , in con - trast to simple SIR models where the basic reproduction number can readily be deﬁned through the relation R 0 = 1 + rTg ( 5 ) , it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd a proper deﬁnition of the basic reproduc - tion number in populations characterized by realistic connectivity patterns . The daily effective reproduction number and generation time can be computed from the microsimulations by keeping track of the exact number of secondary infections generated by each indi - vidual infected at time t in the simulations ( Fig . 1 C ) . We ﬁnd that R ( t ) increases over time in the early phase of the epidemic , start - ing from R index 0 = 1 . 3 to a peak of about 2 . 1 ( Fig . 2 B ) . In contrast , in the homogeneous model , which lacks the typical structures of human populations , R ( t ) is nearly constant in the early epi - demic phase and then rapidly declines before the epidemic peak ( Fig . 2 A ) as predicted by classical mathematical epidemiology theory ( 4 ) . The pattern found in the data - driven model can also be partly explained by the variation of the average degree induced by the infection of individuals with a higher number of adequate contacts [ an effect already observed in heavy - tailed networks ( 51 ) ] , thus leading to an average growth of the repro - duction number . The temporal dynamics of R ( t ) does not show a constant phase , implying that R 0 loses its meaning as a funda - mental indicator in favor of R ( t ) . Although we report the results averaged over 50 , 000 realizations of the model , this result is sup - ported by our analysis of the outcome of each single simulation , highlighting that the early time increase of R ( t ) is a common pat - tern in the performed simulations ( SI Appendix , section 2 . 1 ) . In Fig . 2 C , we show an analogous analysis of the estimated genera - tion time in the data - driven model . We ﬁnd that the generation time is considerably shorter than the duration of the infectious period ( i . e . , 3 d in our simulations ) . The estimated average Tg over the whole epidemic is 2 . 67 d ( ≈ 11 % shorter than the the - oretical value ) , with a more marked shortening right before the epidemic peak ( Fig . 2 C ) . This differs from what is predicted by the classic theory and the analysis of the homogeneous model ( Fig . 2 C ) , where the length of the infectious period corresponds to the generation time ( 6 ) . A closer look at the transmission process in the different lay - ers of the multiplex network helps in understanding the origin A B C Fig . 2 . Fundamental epidemiological indicators .

The horizontal dotted gray line represent the constant value of the duration of the infectious period . of the deviations of R ( t ) and Tg ( t ) from the classical theory ( Fig . 3 ) . Speciﬁcally , we found that the average degree of infec - tious nodes as well as R ( t ) tend to peak in the workplace layer ( SI Appendix , section 2 . 2 ) , and at least to some extent , the same happens in the school layer . However , R ( t ) generally decreases in the household and community layers ( Fig . 3 A ) . Indeed , R ( t ) in the household layer tends to be more uniform across the different nodes and thus , follows a general decreasing trend sim - ply led by the depletion of susceptible contacts . We also found that , in the household layer , Tg is remarkably shorter than in all other layers ( Fig . 3 B ) —with an average ﬂuctuating around 2 . 6 d , close to the value reported by analyzing real data for house - hold transmission ( 26 ) . To provide a simple illustration of the saturation effect in households , let us consider a household of three , with one index case and two susceptible members . If , at time t , the index case infects exactly one of the two susceptibles , 12682 | www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1811115115 Liu et al .

A similar argument was used in ref . 52 to explain why observed generation times are shorter than the infectious period . This evi - dence calls for considering within household competition effects when providing empirical estimates of the generation time ( or serial interval ) from household studies . Saturation effects are also responsible for shortening Tg in the other transmission set - tings , with the exception of the general community ( Fig . 3 B ) . All of the observed patterns of R ( t ) and Tg ( t ) are robust with respect to changes in the sociodemographic structure of the pop - ulation ( i . e . , we simulated the infection spreading in both the Italian and Dutch synthetic populations ) , inﬂuenza transmission intensity ( measured in terms of R index ) , and the distribution of the removal time ( we tested exponential and gamma distributions ) . These analyses are reported in SI Appendix , sections 2 . 4 – 2 . 6 . The 2009 H1N1 Inﬂuenza Pandemic in Italy . To test the robustness of the results in a more realistic epidemic transmission model , we used the data - driven modeling framework to model the 2009 inﬂuenza pandemic in Italy . One of the characteristic signatures of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was the presence of a differential susceptibility by age ( 34 , 53 , 54 ) ; this is included in the model by using values estimated for Italy as reported in the literature ( 55 ) . We also consider prepandemic immunity by age in the pop - ulation according to serological data ( 55 ) . Vaccination is not considered , as vaccination started only during the tail of the pan - demic and had a very limited uptake in Italy ( vaccination cover - age < 1 % ) ( 56 ) . As in the previous section , the model has four unknown parameters : the four layer - speciﬁc transmission rates . They are calibrated through a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) approachonseroprevalencedatabyagecollected in Italy before and after the 2009 H1N1 inﬂuenza pandemic ( 55 ) . Model details are provided in SI Appendix , section 1 . 1 . The calibrated model is able to well capture the seropositive rates by age at the end of the pandemic ( Fig . 4 A ) . The estimated growth rate from the inﬂuenza - like illness ( ILI ) cases reported in Italy over the course of the 2009 H1N1 inﬂuenza pandemic clearly shows an increasing trend during the early phase of the epidemic followed by a sharp drop about 3 weeks before the epidemic peak ( Fig . 4 B ) . The trend observed in the data is consis - tent with that obtained in model simulations ( Fig . 4 C ) . Fitting a A B C Fig . 4 . The 2009 H1N1 inﬂuenza pandemic in Italy .

An increase in the initial growth rate of the epidemic has also been observed for other diseases and countries ( 57 – 59 ) . Although alternative explanations may exist ( 60 ) , our results provide a plausible explanation for these pat - terns based on the intrinsic structure of human contact networks . In terms of the dynamics of R ( t ) and Tg ( t ) , the model calibrated on the 2009 inﬂuenza pandemic conﬁrms the noticeable devia - tions of the data - driven model from the homogeneous modeling framework ( SI Appendix , section 2 . 3 ) . Discussion Our simulation results clearly highlight how the heterogene - ity and clustering of human interactions ( e . g . , contacts between household members , classmates , work colleagues ) alter the stan - dard results of fundamental epidemiological indicators , such as the reproduction number and generation time over the course of an epidemic . Our results seem to be consistent in different countries ( SI Appendix , section 2 . 4 ) , suggesting that the observed patterns are due to the structure and clustering of human con - tact patterns rather than country - speciﬁc features . Furthermore , the analysis of alternative null models , such as degree - preserving and layer - preserving conﬁguration models ( SI Appendix , section 2 . 7 ) , shows markedly different behaviors than those exhibited by the data - driven model , suggesting that the multiplex structure and the strong clustering effect typical of human populations , not captured by null models , are at the root of the observed behavior . Our numerical study questions the measurability of R 0 in realistic populations and its adequacy even as an approximate descriptor of the epidemic dynamics . However , it is still possible to characterize the dynamics of an epidemic in terms of its effec - tive reproduction number over time by estimating R ( t ) from the daily number of new cases by using Bayesian approaches ( 11 , 17 ) ( Materials and Methods ) . In Fig . 5 , we show the compari - son between R ( t ) as inferred from the time series of cases and R ( t ) resulting from the microsimulation data of the transmission chain for one stochastic model realization ( other realizations are shown in SI Appendix , section 2 . 8 ) . The overall good agreement between the estimated and actual values shows that it is possible to operationalize the estimation of R ( t ) to provide projections of the epidemic dynamics . The goodness of the obtained estimates depends on the knowledge of the distribution of the generation time ( Fig . 5 ) and on the availability of a reliable time series of cases not markedly affected by noise and underreporting ( 10 ) . Conclusion The analysis presented here takes advantage of “in silico” numer - ical experiments to open a window of understanding in the analysis of realistic epidemic scenarios . Although a lot of theo - retical work has been done to deﬁne the reproduction number in nonhomogeneous models ( 19 – 24 ) , a uniﬁed theory is still lack - ing . While we are not providing a theoretical framework for the computation / deﬁnition of the reproduction number and the gen - eration time on realistic contact networks , we provide evidence that estimates of R ( t ) can be used to characterize the epidemic without resorting to untenable assumptions that may eventu - ally mislead our understanding of the epidemic transmission potential and temporal dynamics . Materials and Methods Data - Driven Contact Network . The model considers a weighted multiplex network ( 38 ) (cid:126) G = ( G H , G S , G W , G C ) , where H , S , W , and C represent house - hold , school , workplace , and community layers , respectively . Let us deﬁne V as the set of all nodes , which is common to all layers , and E α as the set of edges in layer α . We can thus characterize each layer G α = ( V , E α ) by the C B A Fig . 5 .

Homogeneous Mixing Network . This model assumes a single fully connected network . Followingthenotationintroducedabove , wehave a ij = w foreach i and j , where w = 1 / ( N − 1 ) and N is the total number of individuals in the population . The Epidemic Transmission Model . On each of the introduced networks , we simulate the inﬂuenza transmission process as an SIR model . The SIR model assumes that individuals can be in one of the following three states : sus - ceptible , infectious , and removed . Two types of transitions between states are possible : ( i ) from susceptible to infectious and ( ii ) from infectious to removed . The transition from susceptible to infectious requires a contact between an infectious individual and a susceptible individual . Speciﬁcally , given that , at time step t , node j is infectious and its neighbor node i is susceptible , the probability that j infects i ( i . e . , i changes its status from susceptible to infectious ) is given by β = pw , where p is the transmission probability per contact and w is the contact weight . However , the transition from infectious to removed does not involve contact between individuals . Given that , at time step t , node i is in the infectious state , it has a probability γ to recover at time step t + 1 . Estimation of R ( t ) from Transmission Events Time Series . Following the same approach used in refs . 11 and 17 , we assume that the daily number of new cases C ( t ) at time t can be approximated by a Poisson according to the following equation : C ( t ) ≈ Pois (cid:32) R ( t ) t (cid:88) s = 1 φ ( s ) C ( t − s ) (cid:33) , where φ is the generation time distribution and R ( t ) is the effective repro - duction number at time t . The likelihood L of the observed time series of cases from day 1 to T is thus given by 12684 | www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1811115115 Liu et al .

The posterior distribution of R ( t ) is then explored using MCMC sampling . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS . Q . - H . L . acknowledges support from Program of the China Scholarships Council Grant 201606070059 .
