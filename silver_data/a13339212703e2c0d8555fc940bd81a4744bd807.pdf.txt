SYMPOSIUM Cellular Respiration : The Nexus of Stress , Condition , and Ornamentation Geoffrey E . Hill 1 Department of Biological Sciences , 331 Funchess Hall , Auburn University , Auburn , AL 36849 - 5414 , USA From the symposium ‘‘Stress , Condition and Ornamentation’’ presented at the annual meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology , January 3 – 7 , 2014 at Austin , Texas . 1 E - mail : ghill @ auburn . edu Synopsis A fundamental hypothesis for the evolution and maintenance of ornamental traits is that ornaments convey information to choosing females about the quality of prospective mates . A diverse array of ornaments ( e . g . , colors , morphological features , and behaviors ) has been associated with a wide range of measures of individual quality , but decades of study of such indicator traits have failed to produce general mechanisms of honest signaling . Here , I propose that efficiency of cellular respiration , as a product of mitochondrial function , underlies the associations between orna - mentation and performance for a broad range of traits across taxa . A large biomedical literature documents the funda - mental biochemical links between oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) and the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , the process of metabolism , the function of the immune system , the synthesis of proteins , and the development and function of the nervous system . The production of virtually all ornaments whose expressions have been demonstrated to be condition - dependent is directly affected by the efficiency of cellular respiration , suggesting that the signaling of respiratory efficiency may be the primary function of such traits . Furthermore , the production of ornaments links to stress - response systems , including particularly the neuroendocrine system , through mitochondrial function , thereby makes ornamental traits effective signals of the capacity to withstand environmental perturbations . The identification of a unifying mechanism of honest signaling holds the potential to connect many heretofore - disparate fields of study related to stress and ornamentation , including neuroendocrinology , respiratory physiology , metabolic physiology , and immunology . Introduction For more than three decades , behavioral , evolution - ary , and physiological ecologists have been fascinated by the idea that the quality of an ornamental display might signal key information about an individual’s condition ( Zahavi 1975 ; Kodric - Brown and Brown 1984 ; Andersson 1994 ; Møller 1994 ; Hill 2002 ; Warren et al . 2013 ) . Many studies have shown links between ornamentation and various measures of conditon , including recovery from , and resistance to , parasites ( Møller 1994 ; Lindstro¨m and Lundstro¨m 2000 ; Roulin et al . 2001 ; Hill and Farmer 2005 ) , im - munocompetence ( Reid et al . 2005 ; Mougeot 2008 ) , oxidative state ( Pe´rez - Rodrı´guez et al . 2010 ) , capacity to survive an epidemic ( Nolan et al . 1998 ; Van Oort and Dawson 2005 ) , moderation of stress - response ( Douglas et al . 2009 ; Almasi et al . 2010 ) , cognition and problem - solving ( Keagy et al . 2011 ; Mateos - Gonzalez et al . 2011 ) , and quality of sperm ( Peters et al . 2004 ; Helfenstein et al . 2010 ; Navara et al . 2012 ) . Despite this focused interest , studies of con - dition - dependent signaling lack coherency ( Warren et al . 2013 ) . The failure to uncover general mechanisms linking ornamentation to individual condition is at least in part a consequence of the lack of a clear and com - prehensive definition of the concept of condition . In a recent essay , I proposed condition to be ‘‘the func - tionality of vital cellular processes’’ such that ‘‘A condition - dependent display trait is a conspicuous feature of an organism that varies in expression de - pending on the capacity to withstand environmental challenges ’’ ( Hill 2011 ) . These definitions help to clarify what is meant by the concept of condition Integrative and Comparative Biology Integrative and Comparative Biology , volume 54 , number 4 , pp . 645 – 657 doi : 10 . 1093 / icb / icu029 Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology Advanced Access publication May 2 , 2014 (cid:2) The Author 2014 .

Here , I fur - ther clarify the concept of condition by proposing that the core cellular process that determines the condition of animals is cellular respiration . I propose that most condition - dependent ornaments are signals of the efficiency of cellular respiration and that cel - lular respiration links stress - response systems , parti - cularly the neuroendocrine system , to the production of ornamental traits . Testable assumptions The hypothesis that cellular respiration is the funda - mental biochemical process signaled by ornaments provides a testable hypothesis for the mechanistic basis for condition - dependency and honest signaling . For this hypothesis to be an accurate description of natural systems , three key assumptions must be met : First , within populations , individuals must vary in their efficiency of cellular respiration . Mitochondrial functionality , which dictates respira - tory efficiency , is a result both of intrinsic and of extrinsic factors ( Burton et al . 2013 ; Pereira et al . 2014 ) . Intrinsic effects on cellular respiration arise from genetic interactions that are independent of the extra - organismal environment . In contrast , ex - trinsic effects on cellular respiration arise from im - pacts of the environment on mitochondrial function . There is abundant evidence from model systems studied in laboratory environments that intrinsic ef - fects , and especially mitochondrial – nuclear genetic interactions , can generate within - population varia - tion in mitochondrial function ( Frank and Hurst 1996 ; Gemmell et al . 2004 ) including the functional - ity of cellular respiration ( McKenzie et al . 2003 ; Smith et al . 2010 ; Pereira et al . 2014 ) . The few stud - ies that have examined cellular respiration in wild animals indicate that there is also substantial varia - tion in natural populations , with important effects on organisms’ performance ( Salin et al . 2010 , 2012 ) . A second key assumption is that mitochondrial function can be affected by environmental perturba - tions . In other words , extrinsic effects on mitochon - drial function can lead to variation in respiratory efficiency ( Pereira et al . 2014 ) . The effects of a wide range of stressors on mitochondrial function and the central role that mitochondria play in stress – responsiveness are focal topics in the biomed - ical literature ( e . g . , Manoli et al . 2007 ) but have been largely unexplored within the realm of wild animals responding to environmental challenges . Much of this article will focus on reviewing the mechanisms that link environmental stressors to mitochondrial function . Finally , the third critical assumption is that effi - ciency of cellular respiration affects the production of condition - dependent ornaments . The central premise of this hypothesis is that a choosing female cannot directly assess the cellular respiration of a prospective mate . Ornaments evolve as conspicuous , easily perceived , and assessed signals of the efficiency of cellular respiration . I spend the last sections of this article reviewing available evidence that ornamenta - tion signals the efficiency of cellular respiration . The hypothesis that I propose is that a vital life - process underlies honest signaling in a diversity of ornaments . The identification of such a unifying mechanism holds the potential to connect fields of study related to stress and ornamentation , including neuroendocrinology , respiratory physiology , meta - bolic physiology , and immunology . Cellular respiration—the core life - process in animals Life persists by capturing energy from the environ - ment and using energy to organize molecules into more copies of itself ( Lane 2010 ) . Energy both en - ables and constrains life . For animals , energy is made available for life - processes via respiration—the slow combustion of carbohydrates , fats , and proteins through which the chemical energy in food is cap - tured in ATP ( adenosine triphosphate ) or released as heat ( Shutt and McBride 2013 ) . Aerobic respiration involves three metabolic steps : glycolysis , the Krebs cycle , and oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) . Glycolysis occurs in the cytosol ; the Krebs cycle takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria ; OXPHOS occurs via the electron - transport chain and is carried out on the inner mitochondrial mem - brane . The efficiency of cellular respiration deter - mines the number of ATP molecules derived from each unit of food , as well as the number of harmful free radicals that are created by the respiratory pro - cess ( Brand 2005 ; Lane 2011a ; Shutt and McBride 2013 ) . In this article , I focus primarily on the final stage in the respiratory process , the production of ATP by OXPHOS via the electron - transport system . OXPHOS is of special interest with regard to stress , condition , and ornamentation because : ( 1 ) it is the part of the respiratory process in which 90 % of oxygen is consumed and from which most ATP is produced ( Lane 2005 ; Wallace 2008 ) , ( 2 ) it is the source of most of the free radicals that create the 646 G .

Approximately 90 % of ATP is produced from OXPHOS via the transfer of electrons along the elec - tron transport chain from a donor such as NADH to oxygen as the terminal acceptor ( Lane 2005 ) . This flow of electrons powers the pumping of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane , establish - ing the membrane potential that ultimately leads to production of ATP from ADP . Efficient production of ATP depends on availability of oxygen and on an unimpeded flow of electrons along the electron transport chain ( Lane 2011a ) . If there are structural problems with the complexes of the electron trans - port chain then the flow of electrons along the chain is impeded , leading to decreased output of ATP and increased leakage of free radicals ( Murphy 2009 ) . The release of cytochrome C under such conditions of poor OXPHOS performance can trigger apoptosis and the removal of cells that have compromised res - piration ( Hengartner 1998 ) . Efficient respiration de - pends critically not only on the functional integrity of electron transport complexes , but also on the match between respiratory capacity , electron donors , and electron receivers ( Brand and Nicholls 2011 ; Lane 2011a ) . If capacity is too low for the electron donors , the result is wasted energy and an increased production of free radicals ( Barja 2007 ) . In this case , free radicals play a critical role as signaling molecules ( Dro ¨ ge 2002 ) , initiating the up - regulation of genes that code for respiratory capacity ( Lane 2011a ) . Efficiency of cellular respiration is not simply a max - imization of ATP production ; rather , efficiency de - scribes the matching of the output of energy to the need for energy , with minimal production of free radicals ( Brand and Nicholls 2011 ; Lane 2011a ) . The proposition that indicator traits signal the functionality of OXPHOS is inherently attractive be - cause the fundamental premise of indicator traits has always been that they signal core aspects of an indi - vidual’s quality ( Kodric - Brown and Brown 1984 ; Zahavi 1975 ) . Cellular respiration via OXPHOS lies at the very heart of eukaryotic function ( Lane and Martin 2010 ; Wallace and Fan 2010 ) . Numerous , ap - parently unrelated components of condition such as immunocompetence , oxidative state , energy reserves , the neuroendocrine stress axis , and cognition are united in their close association with the process of OXPHOS and mitochondrial function . In this article I review the evidence for links between conventional measures of condition and mitochondrial function and discuss the implications of the hypothesis that cellular respiration is the nexus of condition , stress , and ornamentation ( Fig . 1 ) . Mitochondrial function , efficiency of OXPHOS , and mitonuclear compatibility The emergence and evolution of eukaryotes involved the chimeric union of two genomes now recognized as the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes ( Dyall et al . 2004 ; Lane 2005 ) . Even though these genomes likely began with approximately equal numbers of genes , the great majority of mitochondrial genes ( mt genes ) migrated to the nuclear genome , leaving only 34 mt genes in vertebrate animals ( Lane 2005 ; Wallace 2007 ) . Mitochondrial processes , however , are extremely complex and multifarious and involve the products of more then 1500 genes ( Lopez et al . 2000 ) . Thus , many nuclear genes produce proteins that are expressed in the mitochondria ( N - mt genes ) . Proper functioning of the mitochondria , in - cluding efficient OXPHOS , requires both the appro - priate production and function of N - mt genes and the appropriate production and function of mt genes ( Calvo and Mootha 2010 ) . In addition , the products Fig . 1 A conceptual framework for the mechanistic connections between stress , condition , and ornamentation . Cellular respira - tion / mitochondrial function determine the condition of an indi - vidual . The efficiency of cellular respiration is a product of the somatic state of an animal as influenced by genotype and epi - genotype . Stressors can also have a significant impact on somatic state and , in turn , on cellular respiration . The outcome of the efficiency of cellular respiration is the performance of the animal and the ability to produce ornaments . A choosing female can predict future performance by assessing the ornamentation of a prospective mate . Adapted from Hill ( 2011 ) . Cellular respiration and condition 647 D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / i c b / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 54 / 4 / 645 / 725093 b y gue s t on 13 O c t obe r 2018 of some N - mt genes form complexes with , or inter - act in important ways with , the products of mt genes , and there must be close coordination of these interacting genetic systems ( hereafter called mitonuclear compatibility ) for full functionality of mitochondrial systems ( Blier et al . 2001 ) . Mitochondrial and nuclear components of these pro - tein complexes not only must fit and function to - gether , they must also be produced in stoichiometric proportions ( i . e . , there must be mitonuclear protein balance ) ( Woodson and Chory 2008 ; Hootkooper et al . 2013 ) . Mitonuclear protein imbalance leads to reduced cellular respiration and triggers an unfolded protein response , a classic stress - response mechanism ( Wu and Kaufman 2006 ; Mandl et al . 2013 ) . In this article , when I refer to poor mitochondrial function ( mitochondrial dysfunction ) , I mean poor performance of the cellular and biochemical pro - cesses that are known to take place within mitochon - dria ( Manoli et al . 2007 ) . Mitochondrial dysfunction will include poor performance of OXPHOS , because this is a core mitochondrial process , but it will also include other biochemical processes carried out by mitochondria . Mitochondrial dysfunction can also relate to the number , size , and distribution of mito - chondria within cells and across regions of the body ( Duchen 2004 ) . When there are specific ties to OXPHOS , I will refer to OXPHOS function rather than to mitochondrial function . Stress , condition , and cellular respiration Cellular respiration and oxidative stress Along with ATP , the primary product of OXPHOS is reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . In general , produc - tion of less ROS is indicative of a well functioning electron transport chain ( Murphy 2009 ; Lane 2011a ) . However , production of some ROS is critical for proper system function because ROS serve as key signaling molecules , regulating mitochondrial func - tion ( Mittler et al . 2011 ) . Mitochondria also are pri - marily responsible for oxidative stress - responses that enable increased release of free radicals for defense against invaders and for signaling ( Apel and Hirt 2004 ) , or that lead to reduced release of free radicals , thereby protecting vital tissues ( Foyer and Noctor 2005 ) . The molecular structure of cells , including pro - teins , nucleic acids , and lipids , can be damaged by the redox reactions that are initiated by ROS . The body neutralizes free radicals by employing a host of antioxidants that are both endogenously produced or derived from diet that can either donate or receive electrons without becoming reactive molecules them - selves ( Radak et al . 2013 ) . von Schantz et al . ( 1999 ) first articulated the hypothesis that ornamentation is a signal of individual condition because production of ornaments is sensitive to oxidative stress . Although von Schantz et al . did not focus on trade - offs , other biologists interested in honest signaling related to oxidative stress have proposed that pro - duction of ornaments diverts antioxidants away from the body’s protective mechanisms ( Aguilera and Amat 2007 ; Alonso - Alvarez et al . 2007 ; Costantini 2008 ) . Hence , it is proposed that individuals subject to lower oxidative stress have more resources of an - tioxidant to use for production of ornaments , where - as individuals with higher oxidative stress have fewer resources ( McGraw et al . 2010 ) . An alternative to the resource - allocation hypothe - sis is the shared - pathway hypothesis whereby the mechanisms of production of ornaments share func - tional pathways with core life - supporting pathways , such that ornamentation cannot be fully produced unless core life - supporting pathways are fully func - tional ( Hill 2011 ) . By this hypothesis , the link be - tween the oxidative state of an animal and ornamentation is the functionality of cellular respi - ration . Mitochondrial dysfunction leading to in - creased release of free radicals also leads to reduced capacity for production of ornaments because orna - ment production depends on efficient mitochondrial function ( Hill and Johnson 2013 ; Johnson and Hill 2013 ) . I propose that it is not a tradeoff of resources—be they antioxidants , ATP molecules , lipids , or any other currency—but rather the path - ways shared between ornament production and cellular respiration that is the basis for the persis - tent associations between oxidative state and ornamentation . Stressors and the stress - response In the physiological literature , there is a variable and somewhat inconsistent use of the terms ‘‘stress’’ and ‘‘stressor’’ ( Buchanan 2000 ; Romero et al . 2009 ) . Biologists commonly use the term ‘‘stress’’ to de - scribe both the physiological response to a stressor as well as the stress - response itself ( Romero et al . 2009 ) . In this review , I will generally avoid the term ‘‘stress’’ except in general contexts when ambi - guity is acceptable , and instead use the less ambigu - ous terms ‘‘stressor’’ and ‘‘stress - response’’ . I consider a stressor to be an environmental pertur - bation that disrupts the functionality of the organ - ism ( sensu Badyaev 2005 ; Hill 2011 ) , whereas a 648 G . E . Hill D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / i c b / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 54 / 4 / 645 / 725093 b y gue s t on 13 O c t obe r 2018 stress - response refers to the physiological responses brought about by a stressor ( Buchanan 2000 ) . The overarching concept of stress is intimately linked to condition . Indeed , the signaling function of indicator traits is proposed to be ‘‘the capacity to withstand environmental challenges’’ ( Hill 2011 ) . Stressors are proposed to impact an individual’s con - dition and hence its ornamentation , while condition mediates the effects of an environmental stressor on system function ( Fig . 1 ) . Thus , two inter - related as - pects of an individual are potentially signaled via condition - dependent ornamentation : ( 1 ) functional - ity under normal , non - stressful conditions and ( 2 ) functionality under duress caused by a stressor . The most useful ornaments will be those in which expres - sion under optimal conditions indicates functionality under duress . To make the point of the value of condition - dependent ornaments that signal integrity of systems under duress , an analogy can be drawn between fi - nancial systems and biological systems . Both are highly complex with inputs of resources , pathways through which resources are modified and repack - aged , and end - products that contribute to the fitness ( biological or economic ) of the entity . The recent financial crisis that beset banks , in which a drop in the value of real estate acted as a powerful stressor on financial systems , could be thought of as analo - gous to the environmental perturbations that some - times beset organisms . In the face of a poor market environment some banks failed , some survived in a seriously compromised state , and a few flourished . In other words , some had a higher capacity to maintain functionality of their system while under duress , while others did not . How useful would it have been for investors to have had honest signals of the quality of the internal systems of these financial in - stitutions ? If banks and investment firms had pub - lished uncheatable and easily perceived signals of the system’s integrity , such signals would obviously have been closely monitored by individuals choosing a bank in which to invest . Indicator traits are proposed to evolve as just such uncheatable and easily per - ceived signals of system - integrity ( Kodric - Brown and Brown 1984 ) , and I propose that they do so because ornamentation is intimately linked to cellu - lar respiration ( Fig . 1 ) . The stress axis , immune - response , and mitochondrial function Hormonal control of mitochondrial function The stress - response of vertebrates commonly is dis - cussed within the context of the neuroendocrine mechanisms involved in extra - cellular signaling ( Wingfield et al . 1998 ; Buchanan 2000 ; Husak and Moore 2008 ) . Indeed , the hypothalamic – pituitary – adrenal ( HPA ) axis is termed ‘‘the stress axis’’ ( Herman and Cullinan 1997 ; Romero 2004 ) . One of the primary outcomes of vertebrates’ stress - response is a change in immune responsiveness ( Segerstrom and Miller 2004 ) , and it has been pro - posed and widely discussed that condition - dependent ornamental traits are signals of immunocompetence ( Hamilton and Zuk 1982 ; Folstad and Karter 1992 ; Westneat and Birkhead 1998 ) . Hence , the honesty of ornamental signals often is proposed to emerge either from the cost of immune suppression that arises when testosterone is increased to stimulate the production of ornaments ( Folstad and Karter 1992 ) or from tradeoffs in the use of immune - enhancing elements for ornamentation versus main - tenance ( Alonso - Alvarez et al . 2007 , 2009 ) . In such discussions of stress , condition , immunocompetence , and ornamentation , the missing linchpin is cellular respiration and mitochondrial function . Mitochondria are among the primary sites of action of the steroid and thyroid hormones ( Koufali et al . 2003 ; Psarra et al . 2006 ; Du et al . 2009 ; Lee et al . 2013 ) . They primarily are responsible for meeting the energy demands of a stress - response by oxidizing energy - storing molecules that are mobi - lized from energy stores . Thus , stress hormones might be viewed as regulators of mitochondrial pro - cesses ( Psarra and Sekeris 2009 ) and particularly OXPHOS ( Scheller and Sekeris 2013 ) ; such that the links between stress hormones and system function play out through mitochondrial processes ( Fig . 2 ) . Stressors can have a direct effect on mitochondrial function and hence on cellular respiration . Indeed , a stress - response is largely a mitochondrial response ( Manoli et al . 2007 ; Shutt and McBride 2013 ) , and mitochondria employ a range of mechanisms , often under regulation of stress hormones , in response to stress ( Manoli et al . 2007 ) including : ( 1 ) modifying the production of energy , ( 2 ) making more mito - chondria in targeted tissue thereby providing greater respiratory capacity ( Jornayvaz and Shulman 2010 ) , ( 3 ) mediating rate of transcription – regulation both of mitochondrial and nuclear subunits of electron - transport complexes that control respiratory capacity ( Psarra et al . 2006 ) , ( 4 ) fever response ( Mackowiak 1998 ) , ( 5 ) controlling signal transduction to the nu - cleus and other organelles that coordinate whole - cell responses ( Hamanaka and Chandel 2010 ) , ( 6 ) gener - ating ROS for signaling and defense ( Underhill and Ozinsky 2002 ; Lambeth 2004 ) , ( 7 ) regulating innate immune - responses ( Arnoult et al . 2011 ; West et al . Cellular respiration and condition 649 D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / i c b / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 54 / 4 / 645 / 725093 b y gue s t on 13 O c t obe r 2018 2011 ) , and ( 8 ) regulating apoptosis of cells in af - fected tissues ( Arnoult et al . 2009 ; Ohta and Nishiyama 2011 ) . Each of these stress - responses is intimately related to cellular respiration . Hormones affect mitochondrial function through action on nuclear and mitochondrial gene transcrip - tion ( Psarra et al . 2006 ; Scheller and Sekeris 2013 ) . Glucocorticoid receptors are present in mitochondria and the mitochondrial genome has elements of glu - cocorticoid response , suggesting that mitochondrial genes are under direct glucocorticoid control ( Lee et al . 2013 ) . Thus , it appears that mitochondrial function can be regulated by glucocorticoids either via direct action on mitochondrial OXPHOS genes or by indirect effects through interaction with nu - clear genes that code for OXPHOS complexes ( Lee et al . 2013 ) . Innate immunity and mitochondrial function There are also direct connections between cellular respiration and immune - system response , and the metabolic control of immunity is a fast - growing field ( Moore et al . 2008 ; West et al . 2011 ; Strowig et al . 2012 ) . Mitochondrial bioenergetics is tightly linked to innate immunity and to the overall immune - response ( Lartigue and Faustin 2013 ) . Mitochondria first gained attention as key regulators of innate immunity with the discovery of mitochon - drial antiviral signaling protein ( MAVS ) ( Seth et al . 2005 ) , which plays a key role in recognition of vi - ruses and activates a cascade of innate - response mechanisms . Subsequently , mitochondria were shown also to play a key role in bacterial defense ( West et al . 2011 ) . It is now well established that mitochondria sit at the core of innate immune sig - naling and are the primary effectors of immune - responses ( Arnoult et al . 2011 ; West et al . 2011 ; Cloonan and Choi 2012 ) . Arnoult et al . ( 2011 ) proposed that by serving as the center of multiple pathways for innate immunity as well as for production both of ATP and ROS , mitochondria could coordinate tight functional inte - gration of host - defense and metabolic processes . Moreover , functional coupling of innate immunity and mitochondria would ensure that efficient cell - intrinsic defense pathways involving release of ROS would only be activated in cells with appropriate mitochondrial membrane potential and oxidative state . These recent studies linking immune defense to mitochondrial function and cellular respiration provide an intriguing explanation for the often - ob - served associations between ornamentation , immu - nocompetence , and the oxidative state of wild animals ( reviewed by Simons et al . 2012 ) . Mitochondrial function and metabolism In many papers that focus on the condition of ani - mals in natural environments , condition is defined as the amount of body fat—usually mass - corrected for body size but sometimes actual amount of fat in the body [ discussed by Hill ( 2011 ) ] . This conceptualiza - tion of condition is flawed for most animals in most environments because it assumes that animals are selected to maximize their amount of body fat , an assumption that often is not true ( Rogers 1987 ; Witter and Cuthill 1993 ) . However , there does seem to be a fundamental connection between con - dition and metabolism . Not coincidentally , mito - chondrial dysfunction and , in particular , dysfunction of mitochondrial bioenergetics , has taken center stage in biomedical research on meta - bolic disorders ( Koene and Smeitink 2011 ) , including diabetes ( Lane 2006 ) , and in studies focused on diet and aging ( Keagy et al . 2011 ; Shutt and McBride 2013 ) . Cellular respiration in mitochondria provides the link between stress - response systems and meta - bolic regulation and function ( Metallo and Vander Fig . 2 A conceptual framework for the connections between the stress - response system , mitochondrial function , and key aspects of individual performance . Stressors affect various aspects of mitochondrial function via hormonal and non - hormonal signaling molecules , especially glucocorticoids via the HPA axis . Changes in mitochondrial function in turn affect a host of key aspects of the performance of individuals , including ATP production , heat production via uncoupling of the inner membrane , metabolic rate , lipogenesis , immune responsiveness , and oxidative state . Conventional views of the connections between ornamentation and the stress axis have focused on the effects of hormones per se , but moving the focus to the effects of mitochondria , under regulation of hormones , holds promise of clarifying the links between stress , condition , and ornamentation . 650 G .

One especially interesting link between environ - mental stress and the production of ATP and ROS via OXPHOS is the metabolic intermediate nicotin - amide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD þ ) . NAD þ is a central regulator of cellular energy homeostasis ( Karpac and Jasper 2013 ) and the maintenance of an optimal NAD þ / NADH ratio is essential for a fully functional electron - transport system and high output of ATP associated with low production of ROS . The synthesis and catabolism of NAD þ is sen - sitive to environmental conditions , especially nutri - tion and pathogens , thereby linking environmental stressors to metabolic activity ( Hootkooper et al . 2013 ; Houtkooper et al . 2010 ) . At present , metabolic studies of wild animals in ecological contexts are limited to measures of body - composition , oxygen consumption , and basal metabolic rates ( Speakman et al . 2003 ) . New insights into the mechanistic links between cellular respiration , fat stores , and ornamen - tation should emerge as studies begin to include specific pathways related to the control of mitochon - drial processes . Stress , condition , and ornamentation I propose that the widely discussed associations be - tween glucocorticoids , stress , ornamentation , and immune responses ( e . g . , Buchanan 2000 ; Bortolotti et al . 2009 ) arise as stressors affect mitochondrial function and hence affect ornamentation and perfor - mance , with hormones mediating these responses ( Fig . 1 ) . If this hypothesis is correct , then fundamen - tal advances in understanding of responsiveness to stress will come not through studies of the mediators of metabolic responses but through studies of mito - chondrial function . Linking ornamentation to cellular respiration Behavioral displays The simplest links between cellular respiration and ornamentation involve ATP . If production of an or - nament demands so much energy that high levels of ATP are required , then necessarily there is a direct connection between ornamentation and cellular res - piration . Such a link between ornamentation and ca - pacity for production of ATP is best demonstrated in the classic work on sexual selection in Colias butter - flies . These insects were studied under variable ther - mal conditions , and different allelic variants of phosphoglucose isomerase ( PGI ) were favored in different environments ( Watt et al . 1983 ) . PGI is responsible for the second step of glycolysis and thus plays a key role in production of ATP . Whether or not males had the correct PGI type for their thermal environment influenced their flight - dis - play and females used flight - display as an important criterion for choosing a mate ( Watt et al . 1986 ) . Thus , the ornament ( flight - display ) served as an honest signal of functionality of the glycolytic system of a male under thermal stress , which has direct consequences for fitness ( Watt et al . 1983 ) . In this example it is efficiency of glycolysis rather than OXPHOS that is signaled by the behavioral display , but OXPHOS efficiency was not investigated . OXHPOS efficiency would also affect output of ATP and hence flight - display within this same Colias system . Note that in this Colias butterfly system , it is the capacity to produce ATP rather than the size of the pool of previously produced energy that is signaled by flight displays . There is a need for in - time pro - duction of energy at a high rate for maximal flight - displays . Thus , in the Colias example there is no need to invoke tradeoffs between the use of energy for body maintenance versus its use for ornamentation ( reviewed by Hill 2011 ) . Indeed , there is little empir - ical support for tradeoffs in the use of stored energy as the basis for honest signaling in any system , and the shared - pathways hypothesis invokes no such tra - deoffs . If the production of ornaments is dependent on immediate production of ATP and ATP - production is derived from the functionality of cel - lular respiration , then ornamental traits can serve as direct windows into the functionality of cellular res - piration . The sorts of links between capacity for energy - production , system - performance , mate - choice , and cellular respiration that were observed for Colias butterflies seem likely to exist for many energy - demanding behavioral displays in a wide range of species . Given that all functions of the body require energy , there is potential for competing energy de - mands to restrict production of ornaments , as pro - posed by Rowe and Houle ( 1996 ) . However , a healthy system can respond to an increased demand for energy by increasing output ( Barja 2007 ; Lane 2011b ) . I propose that it is not the avail - ability of energy per se that is likely to be signaled by ornamentation but the capacity to produce energy . I predict that many of the behavioral displays of animals serve as uncheatable signals of the capac - ity for efficient energy production via cellular respiration . Cellular respiration and condition 651 D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / i c b / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 54 / 4 / 645 / 725093 b y gue s t on 13 O c t obe r 2018 Carotenoid pigmentation Carotenoid coloration is among the classes of orna - ments that are most frequently studied within the context of condition - dependent signaling ( Cotton et al . 2006 ; Hill 2007 ; Garratt and Brooks 2012 ) . Carotenoids were first proposed to be honest signals of the quality of a male because carotenoid pigments were viewed as scarce resources that were difficult to accrue such that only high - quality males could dis - play bright coloration ( Endler 1980 ; Hill 1992 ) . More recently , the focus has been on the resource - tradeoff hypothesis , wherein carotenoids are proposed to be essential , but limited , resources needed for immune - defense and protection against free radicals ( Møller et al . 2000 ; Alonso - Alvarez et al . 2007 , 2009 ) . By this hypothesis , only high - condition males can sacrifice carotenoid resources for ornamentation . However , even when access to carotenoid resources is not lim - iting , individuals often display significant variation in carotenoid coloration ( Bortolotti et al . 1996 ; Karu et al . 2008 ) . The hypothesis that ornamental coloration is a signal of the functionality of cellular respiration ( Hill and Johnson 2012 ) presents a novel explanation for the associations between carotenoid coloration and measures of performance such as the production of protein structures ( Hill and Montgomerie 1994 ) , oxidative stress ( Cote et al . 2010 ; Pe´rez - Rodrı´guez et al . 2010 ) , immunocompetence ( Blount et al . 2003 ; McGraw and Ardia 2003 ) , body fat ( Pe´rez - Rodrı´guez and Vin˜uela 2008 ) , and aerobic capacity ( Kelly et al . 2012 ; Mateos - Gonzalez et al . 2014 ) . The key assumption of this shared - pathway hypothesis as it applies to carotenoids is that the mechanisms of carotenoid pigmentation are closely tied to mito - chondrial function ( Hill and Johnson 2012 , 2013 ; Johnson and Hill 2013 ) . With few exceptions , animals attain carotenoid - based red coloration by oxidizing dietary yellow ca - rotenoid pigments into ketolated products with a red hue ( Goodwin 1984 ; McGraw 2006 ) . This process of carotenoid ketolation is sensitive to oxidative condi - tions in cells and is thus inherently tied to OXPHOS ( Hill and Johnson 2012 ) . Moreover , it has been pro - posed that ketolation of dietary carotenoids takes place on the inner mitochondrial membrane in close association with electron - transport complexes , such that respiratory efficiency dictates the produc - tion of color ( Johnson and Hill 2013 ) . For displays of non - ketolated carotenoids , different mechanisms have been proposed to link the production of color to mitochondrial function ( Hill and Johnson 2012 ) . In support of the hypothesis that yellow xanthophylls can signal respiratory efficiency , a recent study found that the brightness of yellow coloration in American Goldfinches ( Cardeulis tristis ) was significantly posi - tively correlated with resting metabolic rate ( Kelly et al . 2012 ) . Carotenoid signaling systems are prime arenas for testing the hypothesis that ornamental traits signal cellular respiration . Other forms of pigmentation might also be linked to mitochondrial function but the connections to cellular respiration are not as clear as with caroten - oids . Recent studies have shown that basic patterns of light / dark coloration among species of animals , as well as between color morphs within species , are under control of melanocortin - 1 - receptor ( MC1R ) ( Mundy et al . 2004 ) . Ducrest et al . ( 2008 ) high - lighted the connections between proopiomelanocor - tins ( POMC ) , which bind MC1R and which in turn control the darkness of plumage and pelage , and a host of cellular pathways including mitochondrial pathways that are linked to POMC through melano - cortin . The same POMC that binds MC1R also binds melanocortin receptors , which in turn play roles in the control of immune - function and regulation of energy , and are linked to the HPA axis ( Ducrest et al . 2008 ) . At this point , links between cellular res - piration and individual variation in melanin pigmen - tation are indirect , and weak connections between mitochondrial function and melanin systems may be the reason that between - individual variation in melanin ornamentation tends not to be as closely linked to individual performance as is carotenoid pigmentation ( Hill and Brawner 1998 ; McGraw and Hill 2000 ) ; but see Griffith et al . ( 2006 ) . Displays of cognitive and motor ability Some ornamental traits—such as the production of multifarious songs , the rendering of intricate and complicated dances , the creation of complex nests and bowers—are founded on cognitive ability . The production and maintenance of the central nervous system are among the most energy - demanding of all system - processes ( Wallace 2008 ; Vannuvel et al . 2013 ; Wang et al . 2013 ) , so cognitive function could simply relate to OXPHOS through a high demand for ATP ( Federico et al . 2012 ) , as described above . However , the links between mitochondrial function and neurological function are far more complex than simply the production of ATP ( Dro¨ge 2002 ; Lin and Beal 2006 ) . Associations between cellular respiration and neu - rological function have been studied primarily within the realm of human neurological disorders . Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to several 652 G . E . Hill D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / i c b / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 54 / 4 / 645 / 725093 b y gue s t on 13 O c t obe r 2018 prominent neurological diseases in humans , espe - cially Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases ( Fukui and Moraes 2008 ; Filosto et al . 2011 ) . In neurons , the ability of mitochondria to modulate the flux of calcium is essential for controlling neurogenesis , neu - ronal plasticity , and release of neurotransmitters ( Chinopoulos and Adam - Vizi 2006 ; Kann and Kova´cs 2007 ; Wojda et al . 2008 ) , thereby placing mitochondria at the center of pathways related to nervous - system function . Growing evidence suggests that mitochondrial respiratory pathways play central roles in neurogenesis , maintenance of an effective nervous system , motor coordination , and cognitive function that results from nervous - system function ( Lin and Beal 2006 ; Bishop et al . 2010 ) . It is intriguing to speculate that the many court - ship displays of animals , including complex songs ; long , complicated , and challenging movements ; and products of cognitive performance such as complex weaving in nests , or decoration of bowers , are the objects of female - choice because they reflect highly functioning nervous systems ( Nowicki et al . 1998 ) . Proficient nervous function , in turn , may be one of the best indicators of a fully functional system of cellular respiration because of the links between mi - tochondrial function and nervous - system function . At present , there is virtually no direct observation by which to assess the idea that better cognitive and motor - neural performance by individuals in a population reflects better mitochondrial function . Studies of the links between cognitive performance and mitochondrial function should yield fascinating results . Conclusions Current theory proposes that stress , condition , and ornamentation are linked through energy stores , with condition reflecting the pool of available energy that is needed for both ornamentation and body mainte - nance . This resource - tradeoff view of the associations between stress , condition , and ornamentation , how - ever , is not supported by many studies of either model or non - model organisms in which resources are provided ad libitum and stress - responsiveness and ornamentation still vary among individuals . Indeed , the resource - tradeoff hypothesis is a concep - tual framework that is contradicted by every - day ex - periences . We provide our pets , our livestock , and ourselves with unlimited access to energy , yet we still observe substantial differences in all manner of performances from running - endurance to disease re - sistance to longevity . I propose that stress , condition , and ornamentation are connected not by energy reserves , but through the capacity to efficiently pro - duce energy , which is a product of the genotype , epigenotype , and somatic state ( Hill 2011 ; Fig . 1 ) . I further propose that condition - dependent orna - mental traits evolved specifically as signals of cellular respiration and the capacity to resist the disruptive effects of stressors . Efficiency of cellular respiration is the core aspect of a prospective mate about which a choosing female should most desire information ( Hill and Johnson 2013 ) , and ornamentation gives females essential and otherwise imperceptible infor - mation about the cellular respiration of prospective mates .
