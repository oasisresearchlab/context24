Biber Received : 13 October 2006 / Accepted : 17 January 2007 / Published online : 10 July 2007 # Humana Press Inc . 2007 Abstract Whereas chemokines are well known for their ability to induce cell migration , only recently it became evident that chemokines also control a variety of other cell functions and are versatile messengers in the interaction between a diversity of cell types . In the central nervous system ( CNS ) , chemokines are generally found under both physiological and pathological conditions . Whereas many reports describe chemokine expression in astrocytes and microglia and their role in the migration of leukocytes into the CNS , only few studies describe chemokine expression in neurons . Nevertheless , the expression of neuronal chemokines and the corresponding chemokine receptors in CNS cells under physiological and pathological conditions indicates that neuronal chemokines contribute to CNS cell interaction . In this study , we review recent studies describ - ing neuronal chemokine expression and discuss potential roles of neuronal chemokines in neuron – astrocyte , neuron – microglia , and neuron – neuron interaction . Keywords CNS . Central nervous system . Neurons . Astrocytes . Microglia . Chemokines . Cell interaction Introduction Chemokines are small proteins that are able to induce a chemotactic response in cells expressing the corresponding chemokine receptors . Since the discovery of the first protein with chemotactic activity [ 1 ] , the chemokine family has expanded to approximately 50 chemokines [ 2 ] and 20 receptors [ 3 ] . Chemokines have been divided into four groups based on the position of four conserved cysteine residues in the N - terminal region of the protein . The two largest groups are CXC and CC . The first two cysteines in the CXC group are separated by one amino acid residue , whereas the first two cysteines in the CC group are adjacent to each other [ 4 , 5 ] . The two small groups are the C chemokines , with only one cysteine in the N - terminal region , and the CX3C chemokine , where the first two cysteines are separated by three amino acid residues [ 5 ] . Chemokine receptors are designated according to the chemokine group they preferentially bind . For example , CC chemokines bind to CC receptors and so on . There has yet only been one exception reported , namely CCL21 , that , in addition to CCR7 , also binds to CXCR3 [ 6 – 8 ] . All chemokine receptors belong to the family of G - protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) . In general , GPCRs can bind many different G - proteins , allowing for a great variety of intracellular signaling pathways ( for excellent review , see [ 9 ] ) . The majority of chemokine - induced responses are inhibited by pertussis toxin ( PTX ) , indicating that G a i (cid:1) proteins mediate many effects [ 10 ] . Chemokine receptors can activate intracellular targets like adenylcy - clase , phospholipases , GTPases like Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 and pathways of major kinases like mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) and phosphatidyl inositol - 3 kinase ( PI3 - K ) [ 11 , 12 ] . This diversity of intracellular signaling shows that chemokine receptors , in addition to pathways involved in cell migration , also activate other pathways and may , in that way , control a great spectrum of cellular functions [ 13 , 14 ] .

In addition to chemo - attraction of immune cells , chemokines have been implicated in a variety of cell functions , such as early development , formation of secondary lymphoid organs , wound healing , angiogenesis and angiostasis , regulation of adhesion molecule expression , development of Th1 / Th2 profiles , tumor growth , and metastasis [ 5 , 14 , 18 – 24 ] . Thus , from being molecules thought to solely orchestrate immune cell migration , chemokines are now considered versatile messengers with the ability to control the interaction between a wide diversity of cell types . In addition to their presence in the periphery , numerous studies have demonstrated that chemokines are also expressed in the central nervous system ( CNS ) , where they play a crucial role in physiological and pathological conditions , such as development , synaptic transmission , homeostasis , injury , and disease - associated neuroinflamma - tion [ 19 , 25 , 26 ] . Although astrocytes and microglia are the primary source of chemokines , there is evidence that neurons express and secrete chemokines as well , indicative of a neuronal contribution to chemokine signaling . In this paper , we review recent studies describing neuronal chemo - kine expression and discuss the potential roles of neuronal chemokines in neuron – astrocyte , neuron – microglia , and neuron – neuron interaction . Neuronal Chemokine Expression Approximately 60 studies describe chemokine expression in neurons under physiological and pathological conditions ( see Table 1 ) . These studies , of which the majority is published in the last 3 years , are reviewed in the following sections . CC Chemokines CCL2 CCL2 is currently the most extensively described neuronal chemokine . The majority of reports describing neuronal CCL2 expression are focused on pathological conditions . An induction of neuronal CCL2 expression was described upon ischemia [ 27 – 29 ] , after axonal injury [ 30 – 34 ] and in motoneurons of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , and in mouse models for ALS [ 35 , 36 ] . Interest - ingly , neuronal CCL2 expression in response to ischemia was detectable within 2 h , whereas CCL2 expression in astrocytes was detected only after 2 days [ 27 ] . Although most reports show induction of neuronal CCL2 expression under pathological conditions , a recent study has shown constitutive CCL2 expression in neurons throughout the rat brain [ 37 ] . This study demonstrated that , depending on the brain region , up to 100 % of the neurons were positive for CCL2 [ 37 ] . CCL2 was mainly detected in neuronal cell bodies and costaining - depicted colocalization with various neurotransmitters and neuropeptides , corroborating a popu - lation - specific expression of CCL2 [ 37 ] . Constitutive neuro - nal CCL2 expression was also shown in a human neuronal cell line [ 38 ] and during human CNS development [ 39 ] . CCL3 , CCL4 , and CCL5 At present , there is only one study describing neuronal CCL3 expression in situ , depicting protein expression in adult human brain [ 40 ] . Further , expression of CCL3 , CCL4 , and CCL5 was described in cultured forebrain neurons derived from human first trimester embryos . These chemokines showed increased expression after exposure to immunological stimuli [ 41 ] . CCL3 and CCL4 expression were induced in mouse cerebellar granule neurons after infection with Toxoplasma gondii [ 42 ] , as was CCL5 expression after viral infections [ 43 , 44 ] . CCL21 In a middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO ) mouse model of brain ischemia , cortical neurons rapidly expressed CCL21 in the penumbra of the ischemic core . Because control brain tissue did not express CCL21 , CCL21 was assumed to be specifically expressed in endangered neurons [ 45 ] . In accordance with the in vivo findings , CCL21 expression was induced in cortical neurons in vitro within 2 h after excitotoxicity [ 45 , 46 ] . The CCL21 expression in endangered neurons was rather surprising , as CCL21 is well known for its constitutive expression in secondary lymphoid organs , controlling the homing of mature den - dritic cells and naïve T cells [ 47 ] and is , therefore , generally considered a homeostatic chemokine linked to the devel - opment and maintenance of secondary lymphoid organs [ 48 ] . The rapid CCL21 expression in endangered neurons after injury indicates a brain specific role of CCL21 . This assumption is corroborated by findings in transgenic mice in which CCL21 was expressed ectopically in various tissues . CCL21 expression in the brain induced a massive brain inflammation that killed the animals within 3 days after the expression onset [ 49 ] , whereas CCL21 expression in the skin induced the formation of secondary lymphoid structures [ 50 ] . Other CC Chemokines A single study has demonstrated a constitutive and inducible expression of CCL20 in rat cerebellar granule 138 Mol Neurobiol ( 2007 ) 36 : 137 – 151 Table 1 Neuronal chemokine expression Chemokine Species Condition RNA Protein References CCL2 h Brain + [ 39 ] Spinal cord , ALS ↑ [ 35 ] Monoculture ↑ + [ 41 ] Cell line + [ 38 ] r Brain + [ 37 ] Brain , cranial nerve injury ↑ ↑ [ 30 ] Brain , ischemia ↑ ↑ [ 28 ] Retina , ischemia ↑ [ 168 ] Spinal cord , peripheral nerve injury ↑ ↑ [ 31 – 34 ] Monoculture + [ 164 ] m Brain , ischemia ↑ [ 27 , 29 ] Spinal cord , ALS model ↑ [ 36 ] Monoculture , West Nile virus ↑ [ 43 ] CCL3 h Brain , AD ≈ [ 40 ] Monoculture ↑ + [ 41 ] r Retina , ischemia ↑ [ 168 ] Monoculture + [ 51 ] m Monoculture ↑ [ 42 ] CCL4 h Monoculture ↑ + [ 41 ] r Retina , ischemia ↑ [ 168 ] m Monoculture ↑ [ 42 ] CCL5 h Monoculture ↑ + [ 41 ] m Monoculture ↑ ↑ [ 43 , 44 ] CCL20 r Monoculture + / ↑ [ 51 ] Trigeminal neuron culture ↓ [ 169 ] CCL21 m Brain , ischemia ↑ [ 45 ] Monoculture ↑ ↑ [ 45 , 46 ] Neonatal hippocampal slice culture ↑ [ 46 ] CXCL1 / 2 / 3 r Monoculture + + [ 51 ] CXCL8 h Monoculture + [ 41 ] CXCL9 m Monoculture + [ 43 ] CXCL10 h Brain , HIV ↑ [ 54 ] Mixed brain culture + [ 54 ] mac Brain , HIV ↑ [ 54 ] r Brain , ischemia ↑ [ 52 ] m Brain , entorhinal cortex lesion ↑ [ 53 ] Brain , West Nile virus ↑ ↑ [ 43 ] Monoculture + + [ 43 ] CXCL11 m Monoculture + [ 43 ] CXCL12 h Brain , HIV ↑ [ 59 ] Monoculture + [ 59 ] r Brain + + [ 55 , 60 – 62 ] Monoculture + + [ 58 , 60 , 87 ] m Brain , ischemia ≈ / ↓ [ 56 ] Brain , LPS injection ≈ [ 56 ] Mixed brain culture + [ 59 ] CX3CL1 h Brain , MS ↑ [ 113 ] Brain , HIV ↑ [ 170 ] Spinal cord + [ 66 ] Monoculture ≈ ≈ / ↑ / ↓ [ 74 , 75 , 138 ] Cell line ≈ ↑ / ↓ a [ 66 , 75 , 138 ] mac Brain + [ 66 ] r Brain and spinal cord , EAE ≈ [ 63 , 65 , 66 , 68 ] Spinal cord , peripheral nerve injury ≈ ≈ [ 171 , 172 ] Brain , LPS injection ≈ [ 67 ] Brain , KA injection ≈ [ 67 ] Mol Neurobiol ( 2007 ) 36 : 137 – 151 139139 neurons in vitro , which was suggested to play a role in neuronal apoptosis [ 51 ] . Expression of other CC chemo - kines has not yet been observed in neurons . CXC Chemokines CXCL10 CXCL10 expression was first described in cortical neurons in rat in response to MCAO - induced brain ischemia [ 52 ] . Remarkably , neuronal CXCL10 expression was transient and appeared rapidly after stroke ( within 3 – 12 h ) , whereas CXCL10 expression in astrocytes was detectable later and persisted up to 15 days after MCAO [ 52 ] . Correspondingly , neurons also showed a rapid CXCL10 expression after entorhinal cortex lesion [ 53 ] . Further , neuronal CXCL10 expression and release was induced after viral infection in vitro and in vivo [ 43 , 54 ] . CXCL12 The CXCL12 gene contains three splice variants , termed stromal cell - derived factor - 1 ( SDF - 1 ) α , β , and γ . SDF - 1 γ was cloned from rat brain and showed constitutive neuronal mRNA expression with almost no change in level after peripheral nerve injury [ 55 ] . In addition , SDF - 1 α showed neuronal mRNA expression with almost no change in level after brain ischemia or intracerebral LPS injection [ 56 ] . In contrast , SDF - 1 β mRNA expression was not detected in neurons [ 56 ] . As little is known about the role of SDF splice variants , and most studies did not specify the splice variants , CXCL12 is used for all SDF splice variants henceforth . Like CCL2 , but in contrast to most of the other neuronal chemokines , CXCL12 is expressed constitutively in specif - ic neuronal populations . Neuronal CXCL12 expression in vitro was observed in cultured cortical , hippocampal , and cerebellar neurons from human , rat , and mouse [ 57 – 60 ] . Neuronal CXCL12 expression in vivo was studied in detail in the adult rat brain , showing CXCL12 mRNA and protein expression in cholinergic , dopaminergic , and vasopressin containing neurons throughout the brain [ 61 , 62 ] . Other CXC Chemokines Studies describing the expression of other CXC chemo - kines in neurons are limited . Most notably , in vitro neuronal mRNA expression of CXCL1 [ 51 ] , CXCL8 [ 41 ] , CXCL9 , and CXCL11 [ 43 ] has been illustrated . Expression of other CXC chemokines has not yet been described in neurons . CX3CL1 CX3CL1 was the first chemokine shown to be expressed in neurons [ 63 – 66 ] . Because microglia were shown to express the corresponding receptor CX3CR1 , a role of CX3CL1 – CX3CR1 signaling in neuron – microglia interaction was suggested [ 63 – 65 ] . CX3CL1 is constitutively expressed in human , macaque , rat , and mouse neurons in vitro and in vivo , with high expression in cerebral cortex , hippocampus , caudate putamen , thalamus , and olfactory bulb [ 63 , 65 , 66 , 68 , 69 ] . CX3CL1 appears to be the only chemokine with a higher expression level in brain than in peripheral organs [ 70 ] . It is membrane bound and can be cleaved from the cell surface by proteases of the A Disintegrin and Metal - loprotease ( ADAM ) family [ 71 , 72 ] . The neuronal CX3CL1 mRNA expression remained relatively stable in response to both neuron - damaging stimuli in vitro [ 73 – 77 ] and during neuroinflammation in vivo [ 66 ] , whereas in vitro neurons released CX3CL1 protein after glutamate - induced damage [ 73 , 74 , 78 ] . Furthermore , CX3CL1 concentrations higher than 300 pg / mg were described in aqueous extracts of the brain [ 79 ] , indicating that CX3CL1 can be cleaved from the neuronal membrane and released Table 1 ( continued ) Chemokine Species Condition RNA Protein References Monoculture ≈ ↑ / ↓ a [ 64 , 65 , 73 , 76 , 78 , 118 ] m Brain + + [ 69 ] Brain , prion disease ≈ [ 67 ] Brain , LPS injection ≈ [ 67 ] Brain , KA injection ≈ [ 67 ] Brain , EAE ≈ [ 66 ] Monoculture ≈ ≈ [ 77 ] Cell line ≈ ≈ [ 77 ] h Human , mac macaque , r rat , m mouse , ALS amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , AD Alzheimer ’ s disease , HIV human immunodeficiency virus , MS multiple sclerosis , EAE experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis , LPS lipopolysaccharide , KA kanaic acid ; + present , ≈ present without change in mentioned conditions , ↑ present with increase in mentioned conditions , ↓ present with decrease in mentioned conditions , a Increase in soluble CX3CL1 and decrease in membrane - bound CX3CL1 140 Mol Neurobiol ( 2007 ) 36 : 137 – 151 into the extracellular environment . It is yet unknown which ADAM protease cleaves CX3CL1 in neurons and whether CX3CL1 protein expression changes during in vivo neuro - inflammation or degeneration . Potential Roles of Neuronal Chemokines in Neuron – Astrocyte , Neuron – Microglia , and Neuron – Neuron Interaction Astrocytes , microglia , and neurons have been shown to express chemokine receptors in vitro under physiological and pathological conditions and in vivo . These would include CCR2 for CCL2 , CXCR3 for CCL21 and CXCL10 , CXCR4 for CXCL12 , and CX3CR1 for CX3CL1 . Studies describing the expression of these chemokine receptors on astrocytes , microglia , and neurons ( see Table 2 ) and studies indicating a role for these chemokine – chemokine receptor pairs in CNS cell interaction are discussed in the following sections on neuron – astrocyte , neuron – microglia , and neuron – neuron interaction . Neuron – Astrocyte Interaction Astrocytes comprise the largest group of CNS - residing cells and are not only essential in development , homeostasis , maintenance of the blood – brain barrier , and regulation of central blood flow but are also involved in the immune defense of the CNS . Furthermore , astrocytes are considered to be involved in neuronal information processing [ 80 ] . It is becoming clear that astrocytes play an active role in the intricate chemokine network of the CNS . Not only has it been shown that astrocytes express a wide variety of constitutive and inducible chemokines in vivo and in vitro , there is also extensive evidence that they express a repertoire of chemokine receptors under physiological and pathological conditions ( see reviews [ 81 , 82 ] ) . Neuronal Chemokines Induce Calcium Transients in Astrocytes The activation of intracellular calcium transients is a hallmark in chemokine receptor signaling , a mechanism that also holds true for astrocytes [ 57 , 76 , 83 – 86 ] . Activation of GPCRs , including chemokine receptors , results in a rapid release of calcium from the endoplasmatic reticulum ( ER ) through the activation of inositol - 1 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate receptors on the ER membrane . One of the first chemokines described to induce calcium transients in astrocytes is CXCL12 [ 57 , 85 – 87 ] . CXCL12 concentrations ranging from 0 . 1 to 100 ng / ml [ 85 , 86 ] or 10 – 100 nM [ 57 , 87 ] induced calcium fluxes in in vitro human , rat , and mouse astrocytes . In all cases , CXCL12 - induced calcium mobilization was PTX - sensitive , indicating that this process is G α i - protein mediated . Similar results were found for CXCL10 [ 84 ] , CCL2 [ 83 , 88 ] , and CX3CL1 [ 76 ] . In astrocytes , intracellular calcium transients not only function as a second messenger in multiple intracellular signaling pathways but are also implicated in astrocyte – astrocyte signal propagation , astrocyte – neuron synaptic transmission , and neurotransmitter release ( see reviews [ 80 , 89 ] ) . Recent findings corroborate that chemokines could also be involved in astrocyte - mediated neurotrans - mitter release . CXCL12 induced calcium - dependent release of glutamate from astrocytes in human and rat astrocyte cultures and rat hippocampal slice cultures [ 90 ] . Moreover , reports that investigated the effects of CXCL12 on the electrophysiological properties of neurons in brain slice cultures suggest that CXCL12 - induced effects on neurons at least partly depend on astrocytic glutamate release [ 91 – 93 ] . Whether this astrocytic glutamate release was induced by CXCR4 activation or via other pathways was not investigated . Neuronal Chemokines Induce Astrocyte Proliferation and Migration in Vitro : Implications for Astrogliosis ? Astrocytes respond to CNS injury or neuroinflammation by enhanced GFAP expression , proliferation , and possibly , migration , a process known as astrogliosis ( see review [ 94 ] ) . In these reactive astrocytes , enhanced expression of chemokine receptors has been described under various pathological conditions , such as multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , ischemia , and neoplasm [ 95 – 97 ] . Under these conditions , CXCR3 was mainly found in reactive astrocytes in the proximity of the lesion sites , suggesting that induction of CXCR3 expression in astrocytes is limited to damaged areas of the brain [ 95 – 97 ] . A comparable induction of CCR2 expression was found in reactive astrocytes in MS patients [ 97 ] . Interestingly , both CCL2 and CXCL10 are implicated in astrocyte proliferation in vitro [ 98 , 99 ] . In addition , CXCL12 has been shown to induce astrocyte proliferation in vitro , a process that is dependent on activation of extracellular signal - regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2 [ 87 , 100 – 102 ] . Both CXCL12 - induced astrocyte proliferation and ERK1 / 2 activation was inhibited by PTX and wort - mannin , suggesting that they are dependent on upstream activation of G α i proteins and PI3 - K [ 87 ] . As chemokines are primarily known for their capacity to induce cell migration , migration assays have been used to determine chemokine receptor functionality in astrocytes [ 103 ] . Accordingly , astrocyte migration was demonstrated in vitro in response to CCL2 , CXCL10 , and CXCL12 [ 83 , 84 , 86 , 103 , 104 ] . Thus , reactive astrocytes express various chemokine receptors and activation of these receptors in Mol Neurobiol ( 2007 ) 36 : 137 – 151 141141 Table 2 Chemokine receptor expression in astrocytes , microglia , and neurons Chemokine Receptor Cell type Species Condition RNA Protein References CCL2 CCR2 astrocyte h Brain , MS , HIV ↑ [ 96 , 97 , 173 ] Monoculture ↑ ↑ [ 83 , 99 , 174 – 176 ] mac Monoculture ↑ [ 175 ] r Brain , EAE , LPS injection ↑ [ 177 , 178 ] microglia h Brain , MS , HIV ↑ [ 96 , 173 , 179 ] Monoculture ↓ + [ 173 , 180 ] Glia culture + [ 99 ] r Brain , tumor , LPS injection , NMDA injection ↑ [ 177 , 181 , 182 ] Monoculture ↑ [ 88 ] m Spinal cord , peripheral nerve injury ↑ [ 183 ] neuron h Brain , HIV + [ 184 ] Monoculture + + [ 38 ] Cell line + + [ 38 ] r Brain and spinal cord + + [ 161 , 177 , 185 ] Monoculture + + [ 161 , 164 ] CXCL10 / CCL21 CXCR3 astrocyte h Brain , MS , HIV ↑ [ 95 , 97 , 179 , 186 ] Astrocyte culture ↑ ↑ [ 84 , 98 , 175 ] Mixed glial culture + [ 95 ] mac Monoculture + [ 175 ] m Monoculture + [ 84 ] microglia h Monoculture + + [ 7 , 84 , 98 , 114 ] Cell line ↑ ↑ [ 98 ] r Cell line ↑ / ↓ [ 187 ] m Brain , various infectious agents , axotomy ≈ / ↑ ≈ / ↑ [ 125 ] Monoculture + ↓ [ 45 , 84 ] Cell line ↑ / ↓ [ 188 ] neuron h Brain , AD + ≈ [ 95 , 179 , 189 ] Monoculture + + [ 38 ] Cell line + + [ 38 ] mac Brain , HIV + [ 54 ] r Monoculture + [ 163 ] CXCL12 CXCR4 astrocyte h Brain , HIV ↑ [ 173 , 190 , 191 ] Monoculture ↑ ↑ [ 85 , 90 , 98 , 99 , 175 , 192 – 196 ] mac Monoculture ↑ ↑ [ 85 , 175 ] r Brain + [ 197 ] Monoculture ↑ / ↓ ↑ / ↓ [ 57 , 58 , 102 , 198 ] m Monoculture ↑ / ↓ ↑ / ↓ [ 86 , 101 , 104 , 199 , 200 ] microglia h Brain and spinal cord , HIV + + [ 173 , 179 , 190 , 191 , 201 , 202 ] Monoculture + ↓ [ 98 , 99 , 191 , 202 – 205 ] Cell line ≈ [ 98 ] bab Monoculture ↑ [ 206 ] r Brain + [ 197 ] Monoculture ≈ / ↑ + [ 58 , 207 , 198 ] m Cell line + [ 86 ] neuron h Brain , HIV + ≈ / ↑ [ 179 , 184 , 191 , 197 , 202 , 204 , 208 ] Monoculture + + [ 38 , 85 ] Mixed brain culture + + [ 202 ] Cell line + + [ 38 , 191 , 209 ] mac Brain + [ 210 , 211 ] Monoculture + [ 85 ] r Brain + + [ 57 ] Monoculture + + [ 64 , 158 ] 142 Mol Neurobiol ( 2007 ) 36 : 137 – 151 vitro induces proliferation and migration , cellular reactions that are generally involved in astrogliosis . Therefore , it is tempting to speculate that chemokines are involved in the regulation of astrogliosis upon CNS injury or neuro - inflammation . Whether neuronal chemokines are indeed responsible for either proliferation or migration of astro - cytes in vivo is yet unknown . Neuron – Microglia Interaction Microglia in the healthy CNS are ramified cells that continually survey their environment by moving their processes . Upon injury , they quickly protrude their pro - cesses toward the damaged site and subsequently transform into amoeboid cells , reflecting a fast activation [ 105 , 106 ] . Activated microglia form a first line of defense in CNS injury through their capacity to migrate , proliferate , secrete inflammatory and neurotrophic factors , phagocytose - damaged cells and debris , and present antigens [ 82 , 107 ] . Although activated microglia were initially considered to be detrimental in CNS injury , recent findings indicate a prominent neuroprotective activity as well , suggesting a balance between neurotoxic and neuroprotective microglia activity ( see for recent review , [ 108 ] ) . Therefore , it is of particular interest to gain insight into the process of microglia activation . Until now , it is largely unknown which environmental signals mediate microglia surveillance and activation . Almost 10 years ago , chemokines were indicated as promising candidates for neuron – microglia signaling [ 63 – 65 ] . Because then , various studies have described constitutive chemokine expression in neurons and rapid changes in expression levels upon injury . Parallel to this , corresponding chemokine receptors were described in resting and / or activated microglia . In addition , there is increasing evidence that neurons play an important role in microglia activity , which is at least partly mediated by chemokines . Microglia Activity Upon Neuronal Damage Upon CNS injury , activated microglia retract their protru - sions , transforming into amoeboid cells with migratory and / or proliferative capacities [ 109 – 111 ] . It is known that damaged neurons are accompanied by prominent activated microglia within hours after injury , suggesting that neurons emit signals that attract microglia [ 111 ] . Several findings support the notion that these signals are primarily chemo - kines . Microglia express various chemokine receptors , and cell migration is induced upon exposure to chemokines in vitro [ 7 , 45 , 84 , 112 – 115 ] . Moreover , damaged neurons in culture express and release chemokines like CX3CL1 [ 73 , 74 , 78 ] , CCL21 [ 45 , 46 ] , and CXCL10 [ 43 , 54 ] , all of Table 2 ( continued ) Chemokine Receptor Cell type Species Condition RNA Protein References CX3CL1 CX3CR1 astrocyte h Brain , MS ≈ [ 113 ] Monoculture ↑ + [ 113 , 175 ] mac Monoculture ↑ [ 175 ] r Monoculture ≈ / ↑ ↑ [ 76 , 198 , 212 ] m Monoculture ↓ ↓ [ 77 , 81 , 200 ] microglia h Brain , MS ≈ [ 113 ] Brain , HIV ↑ [ 170 ] Monoculture + + [ 75 , 113 ] r Brain , ischemia , prion disease , cranial nerve injury , EAE ↑ ↑ [ 63 , 67 , 68 , 213 ] Brain , LPS injection , KA injection ≈ [ 67 ] Spinal cord , peripheral nerve injury ↑ ↑ [ 171 , 172 ] Monoculture ↑ / ↓ ↑ [ 63 , 65 , 198 , 212 , 214 ] Cell line ↓ [ 187 ] Brain , LPS injection , KA injection ≈ [ 67 ] m Monoculture ≈ ≈ [ 77 ] neuron h Monoculture + + [ 75 ] Cell line ≈ ↑ [ 75 ] r Brain , LPS injection , KA injection ≈ [ 67 ] Monoculture + + [ 64 , 139 ] m Brain , prion disease ↓ [ 67 ] Brain , LPS injection , KA injection ≈ [ 67 ] h human , mac macaque , bab baboon , r rat , m mouse , MS multiple sclerosis , HIV human immunodeficiency virus , EAE experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis , LPS lipopolysaccharide , NMDA N - methyl - D - aspartatic acid , AD Alzheimer ’ s disease , KA kainic acid ; + present , ≈ present without change in mentioned conditions , ↑ present with increase in mentioned conditions , ↓ present with decrease in mentioned conditions Mol Neurobiol ( 2007 ) 36 : 137 – 151 143143 which are able to induce microglia migration [ 7 , 45 , 46 , 73 , 76 , 84 , 113 , 115 ] . In accordance with this , inhibition of chemokine function diminished microglia migration in response to supernatants from damaged neurons [ 73 ] . Thus , in vitro results suggest a role of neuronal chemokines in neuron – microglia activation . The issue of chemokine - mediated neuron – microglia acti - vation has been further investigated using genetically modi - fied mice . Mice deficient for either CX3CR1 [ 116 ] and CX3CL1 [ 117 ] have been studied in various CNS injury and neuroinflammation models . Although CX3CR1 deficiency did not influence microglia activity in response to facial nerve lesion [ 116 ] , CX3CR1 deficiency was uniformly associated with higher levels of microglia activity in LPS - induced neuroinflammation , 1 - Methyl - 4 - phenyl - 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 - tetrahydropyridin - induced neurotoxicity , and in the SOD1 G93A - model of motoneuronal death in the spinal cord [ 79 ] . Interestingly , enhanced microglia activity in the last three models was accompanied by increased neuronal death , indicating that , in wild - type mice , neurotoxic microglia activity is inhibited by CX3CL1 – CX3CR1 signaling [ 79 ] . These findings are corroborated by several in vitro findings . Exposure of a neuron – microglia coculture to CX3CL1 reduced inflammation - related neuronal death , accompanied by suppressed nitric oxide and proinflammatory cytokine production [ 118 ] . In conjunction with these findings , inhibition of endogenous CX3CL1 increased neuronal cell death in cocultures [ 77 ] . Moreover , in vitro exposure to CX3CL1 supported microglia survival under basal culture conditions and reduced Fas - ligand induced apoptosis con - siderably [ 119 ] . Thus , exposure of microglia to CX3CL1 reduced microglia toxicity and protected microglia from apoptosis under inflammatory conditions . In contrast to these results , CX3CL1 deficiency reduced the infarct volume and mortality after transient focal cerebral ischemia [ 117 ] . However , microglia activity in CX3CL1 - deficient and wild - type mice was not compared in this study , making it difficult to determine whether disturbed neuron – microglia signaling was responsible for the differences [ 117 ] . Increased microglia toxicity by CXCR3 and its ligands CXCL10 and / or CCL21 is suggested by findings derived from the entorhinal cortex lesion ( ECL ) model , in which CXCR3 deficiency was associated with reduced microglia activity and reduced loss of secondary neurons in the hippocampal formation [ 53 ] . An interesting aspect of chemo - kines in neuron – microglia signaling is acknowledged in the ECL model . In this paper , microglia activity is specifically found within the midmolecular layer of the dentate gyrus , which is the projection site of the transected neurons ( see for review , [ 120 ] ) . The microglia activity at a site distant from the primary lesion indicates transport of the chemokine signal . Recent data reinforced this notion , showing that CCL2 that was induced in dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neurons after peripheral nerve injury was transported to afferent terminals in the spinal cord [ 34 ] . Moreover , in vitro neuronal CCL21 was sorted into vesicles , transported into neuronal processes , and even reached presynaptic terminals [ 46 ] . The finding of CCL21 protein in neuronal vesicles is a strong indication that neuronal chemokines may be the signals responsible for microglia activity at sites distant from the primary lesion , a phenomenon that has been observed also in humans [ 121 , 122 ] . A role of CCL2 in microglia activity after neuronal death is suggested by a delayed microglia activity in the thalamus of CCL2 - deficient mice in response to cortical injury [ 123 ] . The delayed microglia activity was accompanied by a transient improvement of neuron survival in the thalamus , which may indicate that CCL2 is involved in neurotoxic microglia activity [ 123 ] . However , it is not yet clear if this effect is due to disturbed neuron – microglia interaction . Damaged neurons are capable to express CCL2 , as was found after axotomy in sympathetic ganglia [ 31 ] and facial nerve lesion [ 30 ] , but cortical injury predominantly induced CCL2 mRNA expres - sion in astrocytes [ 124 ] . Whether interference with CCL2 signaling would affect microglia activity in the first two models has not yet been investigated . It is clear that the assumption that neuronal chemokines are involved in neuron – microglia signaling is no longer based on the finding that damaged neurons rapidly alter chemokine expression patterns and that microglia express the corresponding receptors [ 63 – 65 ] . Studies now show that microglia activation is reduced in mice with genetically disturbed chemokine function , indicating an important role of chemokines in microglia activation . Recent data even suggest that neurosupportive and neurotoxic microglia activity are associated with chemokine receptor expression [ 125 ] . The ultimate effects of neuronal chemokines are likely dependent on injury type , brain region , and disrup - tion of the blood – brain barrier [ 53 , 79 , 116 ] . Whereas the exact role of neuronal chemokines in neuron – microglia signaling remains obscure , their importance in regulating damage responses is becoming apparent . Neuron – Neuron Interaction Various reports indicate that chemokines influence neuronal development , differentiation [ 126 , 127 ] , survival [ 128 – 130 ] , electrophysiological properties [ 93 , 131 , 132 ] , and synaptic transmission [ 26 , 92 , 133 ] . Because neurons can express numerous chemokines , autocrine and paracrine contributions of neuronal chemokines are likely . Neuroprotection Neuronal cell death , the ultimate consequence of all neuro - inflammatory conditions , has been studied extensively in vitro . 144 Mol Neurobiol ( 2007 ) 36 : 137 – 151 However , there are relatively few in vitro models that can be extrapolated to pathological conditions leading to neuronal death in vivo . One of the most prominent models is glutamate or NMDA - induced neurotoxicity , a model for excitotoxicity , which is most likely involved in various neurodegenerative diseases . β - amyloid - induced neuronal death serves as a model that may explain the loss of neurons in Alzheimer ’ s disease , whereas exposure of neuronal cultures to HIV proteins gp120 or HIV tat are aimed to elucidate neuronal death in HIV - dependent neurodegeneration [ 134 – 137 ] . Several reports indicate that neuronal chemokines may protect neurons from these toxic conditions . In vitro , CX3CL1 is known to protect neurons from glutamate - induced toxicity [ 78 , 138 ] , gp120 - induced neuronal death [ 64 , 139 ] , and death induced by deprivation of trophic support [ 140 ] . Similar to CX3CL1 , CCL2 exposure is shown to protect neurons from glutamate - and HIV - tat - induced neurotoxicity [ 141 , 142 ] . However , CCL2 exposure was not protective in β - amyloid - dependent neuronal death [ 141 ] . As exposure of neuronal cells to chemokines is known to activate the putatively neuroprotective MEK / ERK and PI3 - K / Akt sig - naling pathways [ 78 , 138 – 140 ] , it is reasonable to argue that chemokine - dependent protection is mediated by these pathways . Indeed , inhibition of both pathways completely abolished the neuroprotective effects of CX3CL1 in gp120 - and glutamate - induced neurotoxicity in hippocampal neu - rons [ 64 , 78 ] . Interestingly , in case of glutamate - dependent neurotoxicity , the involvement of MEK / ERK and PI3 - K / Akt signaling pathways was only evident when CX3CL1 was applied together with glutamate [ 78 ] . CX3CL1 exposure was shown to be protective even when the chemokine was applied up to 8 h after the glutamate stimulus . However , an inhibition of MEK / ERK and PI3 - K / Akt pathways did not affect the protective activity of delayed CX3CL1 exposure , indicating that CX3CL1 may activate additional pathways in neurons that lead to neuro - protection [ 78 ] . The effect of CXCL12 on neuronal death is contradictory . Although several reports indicate that CXCL12 exposure may protect neurons from gp120 - induced neuronal death , most papers describe a toxic effect of CXCL12 in neuronal cultures ( see below ) [ 64 , 143 ] . Neurotoxicity Approximately 10 % of HIV - infected patients develop HIV - 1 associated dementia ( HAD ) . It has been shown that the viral protein gp120 itself is neurotoxic [ 144 ] , indicating that the neuronal loss in HAD is not only due to inflammation occurring after the virus enters the brain but also because of direct toxic effects of viral proteins ( see for recent review , [ 145 ] ) . It was shown in 1998 that the neurotoxic effect of gp120 is mediated via the chemokine receptor CXCR4 [ 146 ] , findings that have been corroborated in subsequent years by various groups [ 64 , 102 , 147 , 148 ] . The viral protein gp120 binds and activates CXCR4 , the main coreceptor utilized by HIV - 1 to infect T cells . CXCR4 has subsequently become the best investigated chemokine receptor with respect to neurotoxicity , and its involvement in neurotoxic signaling has been demonstrated by use of the specific CXCR4 antagonist AMD31000 [ 102 , 147 ] . The HIV - derived protein gp120 shows agonist activity on CXCR4 , and therefore , it is not surprising that its ligand CXCL12 has also been described to be neurotoxic [ 102 , 143 , 146 , 148 , 149 ] . Currently , there is little information on intracellular signaling pathways that are activated by CXCR4 and subsequently lead to neuronal death . One recent report indicates the involvement of Src activity in CXCL12 - induced apoptosis in a neuronal cell line , whereas gp120 - induced apoptosis in these cells was independent of Src activity [ 149 ] . Interestingly , CXCL12 and gp120 had different effects on ERK activation in neurons and astrocytes [ 102 ] , indicating that CXCR4 signaling exerts both ligand and cell - type specific effects . The effect of CXCL12 is further complicated by matrix metalloprotein - ase - 2 , which was shown to remove the first four amino acids of CXCL12 , resulting in a truncated form of CXCL12 [ 150 ] . This truncated form was found to be highly neurotoxic compared to the full - length CXCL12 , which remarkably was not mediated by CXCR4 but by a yet unknown PTX - sensitive receptor [ 150 ] . Because MMP - 2 has also been described in HIV - infected patients , it is reasonable to assume that truncated CXCL12 may be a neurotoxic player in HAD [ 151 ] . CXCL12 is not the only neuronal chemokine that exerts neurotoxic effects . Neuronal cell lines and primary human neurons respond to high concentrations of CXCL10 with intracellular calcium transients , caspase activity , and apo - ptosis [ 54 , 152 , 153 ] . The direct involvement of CXCR3 was demonstrated by the use of an antibody that prevents the activation of CXCR3 and subsequently inhibited CXCL10 - dependent neurotoxicity [ 153 ] . Chemokinergic Effects on Synaptic Transmission Recent data show that CXCR4 activation by either gp120 or CXCL12 significantly enhanced giant depolarizing potentials ( GDP ) in rat neonatal hippocampus [ 154 ] . These GDPs only occur in the developing hippocampus and are involved in growth and synapse formation . These data may explain why HIV infections have a greater impact in the developing brain than in adults [ 152 ] and show that neuronal chemokines may change the electrophysiological properties of neurons , thereby corroborating earlier findings [ 131 , 132 , 155 , 156 ] . The electrophysiological properties of neuronal chemo - kine receptors have predominantly been studied in cultured Mol Neurobiol ( 2007 ) 36 : 137 – 151 145145 primary neurons or neuronal cell lines and brain slice cultures [ 157 ] . Remarkably , in cultures of DRG , cerebellar granule or Purkinje neurons , and hippocampal pyramidal cells , chemokines induced changes in the electrophysiolog - ical properties of only 10 – 20 % of the neurons [ 64 , 140 , 158 , 159 ] . In addition , several effects of chemokines in neurons were not sensitive to PTX , in contrast to hematopoietic cells , suggesting that chemokine receptors in neurons , although generally accepted , are not solely coupled to G α i proteins [ 128 , 140 , 149 ] . Whether these chemokinergic PTX - insensitive effects are mediated by neuronal G z - subunits is yet unclear [ 160 ] . Cultured cere - bellar and DRG neurons respond to various chemokines with intracellular calcium transients [ 140 ] . In DRG neu - rons , exposure to CX3CL1 and CXCL12 also increased their excitability [ 158 ] . Although chemokinergic effects of CX3CL1 , CXCL12 , CCL2 , and CXCL10 in neurons have been reported to modulate the frequency of both spontane - ous and activity - dependent neuronal firing , a direct effect on the induction of action potentials has not yet been described [ 159 , 161 – 164 ] . Similar to the effects on isolated neurons , CX3CL1 , CXCL12 , and CXCL10 also affected neuronal signaling in brain slice cultures [ 26 , 78 , 91 – 93 , 133 , 134 , 165 , 166 ] . However , the presence of glia cells ( astrocytes , microglia , and oligodendrocytes ) in these slice cultures makes it difficult to determine whether the electrophysiological effects of chemokines are mediated by chemokine receptors on neurons and / or on glia cells , as glia cells may also induce electrophysiological changes in neurons [ 26 , 133 , 156 ] . Whether the effects of CXCL12 in brain slice cultures are mediated via chemokine receptors on neurons and / or on glia cells may depend on the concentration , as concentrations up to 1 nM caused a direct decrease in peak and discharge frequency of evoked action potentials in neurons and concentrations higher than 10 nM activated an indirect GABA - mediated hyperpolarization of neurons [ 92 ] . Future Directions As discussed here , neuronal chemokines appear to be versatile messengers in CNS cell interaction . However , several important issues need to be addressed in future studies . To begin with , neuronal CX3CR1 expression in vivo remains controversial . Immunohistochemical analysis revealed CX3CR1 positive neurons in mouse brain sections with little changes under pathological conditions [ 67 ] , whereas neuronal CX3CR1 expression was never described in studies using genetically modified mice in which CX3CR1 - expressing cells are also positive for EGFP [ 116 ] . Different microscopic techniques and models of neurodegeneration have been explored in these mice , demonstrating only CX3CR1 expression in resting and activated microglia [ 79 , 105 , 106 , 116 ] . An explanation may be that neuronal CX3CR1 expression is at such a low level that detection is difficult to achieve with microscopic techniques . This may also be the case for CXCR3 expression in microglia . Although CXCR3 expression has yet not been described in microglia in vivo , functional evidence derived from CXCR3 - deficient mice strongly indicates that microglia do express CXCR3 in vivo [ 53 , 115 ] . Therefore , it seems appropriate that future experi - ments concerning the expression of chemokine receptors in CNS cells in vivo also include functional analysis . Another issue that needs to be addressed in more detail regards cellular localization . Neurons are highly polarized cells , as their function is largely dependent on their morphology and contacts with other cells ( e . g . synapses with other neurons ) . Although neuronal signaling mole - cules , such as neurotransmitters , neuropeptides , and neuro - trophins , are generally found at specific sites , most reports describing neuronal chemokine expression did not address this issue . Interestingly , a few recent publications do suggest a localized expression of chemokines comparable to other neuronal signaling molecules . Our group demon - strated that neuronal CCL21 is transported in vesicles , reaching presynaptic terminals in cortical neurons in vitro [ 46 ] . In subsequent studies , these vesicles appeared to be of the large - dense core type , in which other neuronal peptides are also found ( e . g . neurotrophins ; Stanulovic et al . , manuscript in preparation ) . Moreover , it has been described for several neuronal populations in vivo that CCL2 and CXCL12 colocalize with other neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in synaptic regions [ 37 , 62 ] . Like neuronal chemokine expression , a site - specific expression of chemo - kine receptors may exist , as is suggested by CXCR4 redistribution in the axonal and dendritic compartment of hippocampal neurons after prolonged CXCL12 exposure [ 167 ] . Because a localized expression of chemokines and their receptors may have a consequence for their role in cell interaction , future studies on neuronal chemokine expres - sion may address this issue . At last , as all reports indicating that chemokine exposure alters the excitability of neurons used exogenous chemo - kines , it is yet unknown whether chemokines released from neurons have similar effects . Conclusion Knowledge on the spatial and temporal expression of neuronal chemokines and their regulation under physiolog - ical and pathological conditions is increasing rapidly . As CNS cells can express the corresponding chemokine receptors , contribution of these neuronal chemokines to 146 Mol Neurobiol ( 2007 ) 36 : 137 – 151 CNS cell interaction is conceivable . This assumption is corroborated by various in vitro and in vivo studies . For example , the following effects of neuronal chemokines were observed in vitro : in astrocytes proliferation and migration , in microglia migration and neurotoxic and neuroprotective activity and in neurons electrophysiological changes , neurotoxicity , and neuroprotection . Further , the synaptic transmission between neurons seems to be influenced by the action of neuronal chemokines on neurons and / or glia cells . In vivo studies support the important role of chemokines in migration and neurotoxic and neuroprotective activity of microglia upon CNS injury and neuroinflammation . Further exploration of the roles of neuronal chemokines in CNS cell interaction is needful , as insight into the role of neuronal chemokines in CNS injury and neuroinflammation may contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies .
