Introduction The rapid spread of COVID - 19 worldwide led to various non - pharmaceutical interventions being implemented by different countries to limit transmission and hence reduce the number of infections ( Ander - son et al . , 2020 ) . Social distancing , mask and shield wearing mandates , and case isolation , quarantine measures have been widely used to limit local transmission and protect vulnerable groups ( Liu et al . , 2021 ) . The day after WHO declared COVID - 19 a pandemic , Belgium went into lockdown with strict measures implemented ( Crisiscentrum , 2021 ) . This resulted in significant mobility reductions in the period of March – April 2020 with non - essential business and offices closed . Working from home also became the norm , and was mandatory when possible . Previous studies evaluating the connection between human mobility and transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 have revealed a clear association between mobility restrictions and lower COVID - 19 incidence ( Badr et al . , 2020 ; Gatalo et al . , 2020 ; Kraemer et al . , 2020 ; Nouvellet et al . , 2021 ) . Reduced social contact patterns were also found to impact the virus transmission ( Coletti et al . , 2021 ; Zhang et al . , 2020 ) . Although these restrictions were found to be highly effective early in the pan - demic ( Gatalo et al . , 2020 ) , many countries are experiencing continued or resurgent widespread transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 ( World Health Organization , 2021 ) . In Belgium , as in many countries , consecutive ∗ Corresponding author . E - mail addresses : minhhanh . nguyen @ uhasselt . be ( M . H . Nguyen ) , christel . faes @ uhasselt . be ( C .

Understanding how mobility , and especially the connectivity amongst regions , impacts the COVID - 19 spread and how it contributed to the observed spatial dynamics is important in evaluating the effec - tiveness of these lockdown measures . This has been studied in the past — including , for example , for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic ( Bajardi et al . , 2011 ) and the West Africa Ebola epidemic ( Peak et al . , 2018 ) . For the case of COVID - 19 , the use of mobile network data ( Badr et al . , 2020 ; Gatalo et al . , 2020 ; Pullano et al . , 2020 ; Slater et al . , 2022 ) , Google and Apple mobility data ( Cot et al . , 2021 ) , and social media data ( Zeng et al . , 2021 ) have been explored as a method to describe the connectivity amongst regions and to induce spatial dependence . In this paper , we use mobile phone data to describe the connectivity amongst areas and study the impact of this connectivity on the spread of COVID - 19 during the second wave of the pandemic in 2020 . We eval - uate how connectivity amongst areas influenced the spatio - temporal spread in Belgium by measuring the effect of between - municipality transmission and simulating scenarios with different mobility levels . The methods used for the spatio - temporal epidemic spread model are https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . sste . 2023 . 100568 Received 25 June 2022 ; Received in revised form 25 November 2022 ; Accepted 12 January 2023 Spatial and Spatio - temporal Epidemiology 45 ( 2023 ) 100568 2 C .

Data and methods In this section , we first describe the data sources used , and then present a data - driven modeling approach to investigate the contribu - tion of mobility on the spread of COVID - 19 . 2 . 1 . Case data The daily numbers of COVID - 19 positive tests for each of the 581 municipalities in Belgium were obtained from Sciensano , the Belgian institute for public health ( Sciensano , 2021 ) . The overall case time series from 1 March until 13 December 2020 is shown in Fig . 1 , which shows a slight bump during the summer period and then a fast increase in October . Note that the first wave in March – April 2020 , in spite of its severity , hardly shows up because of limited testing capacity and hence restrictive testing ( FOD Volksgezondheid , 2021 ) . During this period , testing was only performed for hospitalized patients and health - care workers ( denoted as regulation 1 , R1 in Fig . 1 ) . After this period , testing capacity increased substantially as testing was free for anyone with symptoms or who had made a high - risk contact ( regulation 2 , R2 ) . In the fall of 2020 , at the moment that the number of cases was highest , there was too much pressure on the testing capacity , and the testing ( R3 ) was temporarily limited to those with symptoms . After some weeks , testing was again made available to anyone with symptoms , a high - risk contact or for traveling ( R4 ) . Table S1 in the Supplemental Materials specifies the periods over which each regulation was in place . For the purpose of this paper , we use data from 29 June 2020 to 13 December 2020 , which captures the Summer 2020 flare - up and the second ( Fall ) wave of the epidemic . A weekend effect is apparent in the plot . The spatial distributions of the cases during some selected weeks in August , October , and November 2020 are shown in Fig . 2 . 2 . 2 . Mobility data To examine connectivity between municipalities in Belgium , ag - gregated data from mobile network activity was obtained as from 12 March 2020 . For the purpose of this investigation , we use the data from 29 June 2020 onwards . This provides data on the daily total time customers registered with the telecom provider , while residing in municipality 𝑗 and being active in municipality 𝑖 ≠ 𝑗 . No activity logged for 𝑗 to 𝑖 on a specific day means the two municipalities are not ‘connected’ on that day . Note that the data mainly reflect adults’ mobility . Since most young children are accompanied by an adult , this data is implicitly taking into account some of the mobility of children . Yet , the share of which is unknown . Using the mobile network data , we calculated a daily 7 - day moving average of the proportion of time spent in a municipality . This produces a matrix 𝑾 𝑡 for time 𝑡 , of dimension 581 × 581 , which is a non - symmetric matrix reflecting the commuting behavior of individuals . Figs . 3 and S1 show what the matrices look like for two particular weeks . The 𝑦 - axis in the plot reflects the municipality of origin ( 𝑗 ) , while the 𝑥 - axis corresponds to the destination municipality ( 𝑖 ) . 2 . 3 . Spatial dynamic model Let 𝑌 𝑖 , 𝑡 be the number of confirmed COVID - 19 cases in municipality 𝑖 on day 𝑡 , which we model as a Poisson or negative binomial distributed random variable with mean 𝜇 𝑖 , 𝑡 ( and overdispersion parameter 𝜓 , for a negative binomial variable ) . Assuming that the current number of new infections 𝑌 𝑖 , 𝑡 depends on the ( series of ) past observations 𝑌 𝑖 , 𝑡 − 𝑑 , 𝑑 = 1 , … , 𝐷 with up to 𝐷 = 14 days being considered , our model is formulated as : [ 𝑌 𝑖 , 𝑡 | 𝑌 𝑡 −1 , … , 𝑌 𝑡 − 𝑑 ] ∼ Poi ( 𝜇 𝑖 , 𝑡 ) or [ 𝑌 𝑖 , 𝑡 | 𝑌 𝑡 −1 , … , 𝑌 𝑡 − 𝑑 ] ∼ NegBin ( 𝜇 𝑖 , 𝑡 , 𝜓 ) , with 𝑌 𝑡 − 𝑙 = { 𝑌 1 , 𝑡 − 𝑙 , … , 𝑌 𝑀 , 𝑡 − 𝑙 } the set of confirmed cases at time 𝑡 − 𝑙 . The conditional variance for the negative binomial is given by 𝜇 𝑖 , 𝑡 ( 1 + 𝜇 𝑖 , 𝑡 𝜓 ) with an unknown overdispersion parameter 𝜓 > 0 . The conditional mean 𝜇 𝑖𝑡 is modeled as in Held et al . ( 2005 ) as : 𝜇 𝑖 , 𝑡 = 𝜖 𝑖 , 𝑡 + 𝜆 𝑖 , 𝑡 𝐷 ∑ 𝑑 = 1 𝑢 𝑑 𝑌 𝑖 , 𝑡 − 𝑑 + 𝜙 𝑖 , 𝑡 ( 𝐷 ∑ 𝑑 = 1 ∑ 𝑗 ≠ 𝑖 𝑢 𝑑 𝑤 ∗ 𝑗 , 𝑖 , 𝑡 − 𝑑 𝑌 𝑗 , 𝑡 − 𝑑 ) , ( 1 ) which is the sum of an endemic component 𝜖 𝑖 , 𝑡 , which captures in - fections arising from sources other than past observed cases , a local epidemic component 𝜆 𝑖 , 𝑡 , measuring the effect of within - municipality transmission , and a global epidemic term 𝜙 𝑖 , 𝑡 measuring the effect of between - municipality transmission due to mobility . The three param - eters 𝜖 𝑖 , 𝑡 , 𝜆 𝑖 , 𝑡 , and 𝜙 𝑖 , 𝑡 are constrained to be non - negative and modeled as a natural log - transformed linear combination of different covariates . The first term , the endemic component 𝜖 𝑖 , 𝑡 , is modeled as log ( 𝜖 𝑖 , 𝑡 ) = 𝛼 ( 𝜖 ) + 𝛽 ( 𝜖 ) WE 𝑡 + log ( 𝑁 𝑖 𝑁 ) , ( 2 ) Spatial and Spatio - temporal Epidemiology 45 ( 2023 ) 100568 3 C .

Log - mean percentage time spent in a municipality for specific weeks based on a 7 - day moving average . The 𝑦 - axis represents the origin while the 𝑥 - axis is the destination . Different municipalities are grouped according to the 11 provinces in Belgium ( An : Antwerp ; BF : Brabant Flamand ; Br : Brussels ; BW : Brabant Wallon ; EF : East Flanders ; Ha : Hainaut ; Le : Liège ; Lm : Limburg ; Lu : Luxembourg ; Na : Namur ; WF : West Flanders ) . where 𝛼 ( 𝜖 ) is a constant baseline endemic coefficient and 𝛽 ( 𝜖 ) is the coefficient for the weekend effect , WE 𝑡 . The endemic term is weighed by an offset , i . e . , the population proportion 𝑁 𝑖 ∕ 𝑁 of municipality 𝑖 . The second term , representing the local epidemic or within - municipality component , 𝜆 𝑖 , 𝑡 , is modeled as log ( 𝜆 𝑖 , 𝑡 ) = 𝛼 ( 𝜆 ) 𝑖 + 𝛽 ( 𝜆 ) WE 𝑡 + 𝛾 ( 𝜆 ) log ( 𝑁 𝑖 ) + ∑ 𝑘 𝛿 ( 𝜆 ) 𝑘 𝟏 { 𝑡 is under regulation 𝑘 } ( 𝑡 ) . ( 3 ) Here , we assume either a constant baseline epidemic effect 𝛼 ( 𝜆 ) 0 or a municipality - specific effect 𝛼 ( 𝜆 ) 𝑖 ∼ N ( 𝜆 0 , 𝜏 2 ) , allowing some mu - nicipalities to be above or below the national average in terms of the ongoing infection risk . It may capture such effects as population density or socio - economic composition , that do not explicitly enter the model’s covariate function . The population size was used as a covariate along with two time - dependent covariates : the indicator for weekend day and indicators for the testing regulations ( 𝟏 { 𝑡 is under regulation 𝑘 } ) . Testing regulation ( regulation ) came into the model as a covariate to account for the variability in the number of recorded cases due to different testing strategies that Belgium has implemented throughout the pandemic . Spatial and Spatio - temporal Epidemiology 45 ( 2023 ) 100568 4 C . Ensoy - Musoro et al . The third term represents the mobility component , 𝜙 𝑖 , 𝑡 , and is modeled as log ( 𝜙 𝑖 , 𝑡 ) = 𝛼 ( 𝜙 ) 𝑖 + 𝛽 ( 𝜙 ) WE 𝑡 + 𝛾 ( 𝜙 ) log ( 𝑁 𝑖 ) + ∑ 𝑘 𝛿 ( 𝜙 ) 𝑘 𝟏 { 𝑡 is under regulation 𝑘 } ( 𝑡 ) . ( 4 ) Similar covariates to that of the second term are incorporated here . The normalized Poisson weights 𝑢 𝑑 in ( 1 ) represent the probability for a serial interval of up to 𝐷 days , i . e . , the average time in days between symptom onset in an infectious individual and symptoms emerging in a newly infected individual when both are in close contact . The weights 𝑤 ∗ 𝑗 , 𝑖 , 𝑡 describe the connective strength for all pairs of municipalities . Note that we can distinguish between two types of connectivity , related to the movement of a visitor and of someone returning home . The visitor movement is given by the matrix 𝑽 𝑡 = 𝑾 𝑡 with elements 𝑤 𝑗 , 𝑖 , 𝑡 described by the mobility data , taking the origin municipality as 𝑗 and the destination municipality as 𝑖 , while the movement of someone returning home is given by the transpose of this matrix : 𝑹 𝑡 = 𝑾 𝑇𝑡 , thereby assuming that a customer spotted in the destination municipality will travel back to the origin municipality at the end of the day . For 𝑖 = 𝑗 , 𝑤 𝑗 , 𝑖 , 𝑡 = 0 . Based on this , the following choices are made for the weights 𝑤 ∗ 𝑗 , 𝑖 , 𝑡 : • Time varying connectivity . Using the visitor mobility 𝑊 ∗ 𝑡 = 𝑉 𝑡 or the sum of the visitor and return mobility 𝑊 ∗ 𝑡 = 𝑉 𝑡 + 𝑅 𝑡 . While the first is an asymmetric connectivity matrix , the second version is symmetric . • Fixed connectivity . A constant weight by taking the mean across the investigated time points . Both the visitor mobility and visitor and return mobility as above are investigated . • Smoothed connectivity . A daily , 7 - day average weight : 𝑤 ∗ 𝑗 , 𝑖 , 𝑡 = 1 7 6 ∑ 𝑑 = 0 𝑤 𝑗 , 𝑖 , 𝑡 − 𝑑 based on either the visitor mobility matrix or the visitor and return mobility . This matrix smooths out the mobility trend across a 7 - day period . • Transformed connectivity . A transformation of the weights is also investigated assuming a power transformations of the weight , 𝑤 ∗ 𝑗 , 𝑖 , 𝑡 = 𝑤 𝑝𝑗 , 𝑖 , 𝑡 − 𝑑 , with 𝑝 ∈ ( 0 , 3 ] . A fine grid of powers 𝑝 with a bin width of 0 . 05 was used to select the best transformation . Our approach to construct the mobility weight is novel because it can reflect the change in connectivity between municipalities over time . In addition , while the traditional approach bases the weights on the distance ( or order ) amongst areas , we define weights based on the observed knowledge of actual connectivity amongst regions . 2 . 4 . Inference Models were selected based on the lowest Akaike’s Information Criteria ( AIC ) ( if random effects were not present ) or the lowest log - arithmic score ( if random - effects are present ) . The logarithmic score measures the predictive performance of our model and is calculated as minus the logarithm of the predictive distribution evaluated at the observed count ( Czado et al . , 2009 ) . Parameter inference is performed using maximum likelihood esti - mation in the R package surveillance ( version 1 . 18 , Meyer et al . , 2017 ; Bracher and Held , 2020 ) and R package gnm ( version 1 . 1 - 1 , Turner and Firth , 2020 ) under R version 4 . 0 . 2 . This allows us to calculate the contribution to the incidence in each region owing to the intrinsic , within - region and between - region autoregressive terms . Model predictions were carried out by plugging parameter estimates into the fitted model . A one - day - ahead prediction and a two - week forecast was investigated to assess model fit and the impact of mobility . Dynamic stochastic simulation was done wherein we used the one - day ahead forecast ( 𝜇 𝑖 , 𝑡 + 1 ) to sample from the Negative Binomial distribu - tion and use this sampled count as input for forecasting the next time point ( 𝜇 𝑖 , 𝑡 + 2 ) . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Model selection of epidemic model A comparison of different lag values ( 𝑑 = 1 , … , 𝐷 with up to 𝐷 = 14 days ) and different formulations of the mobility weight indicates a lag of 7 days to fit best , along with using a fixed mobility weight , instead of a 7 - day moving average mobility weight . To further improve model fit , a power transformation was applied to the weight matrix . Fig . 4 shows that the 0 . 9 power - transformed non - symmetric visitor weight matrix fits the data best . Using the symmetric 𝑉 + 𝑅 matrix did not improve model fit . Note that , while the model can account for time - varying connectivity amongst regions , the simpler constant connectivity matrix is better in this analysis . This is in line with the limited impact of restriction measures on mobility during the study period ( Fig . 3 ) , while much stronger restriction measures in April 2020 reduced the connectivity of more distant regions much more ( Figure S1 ) . In addition , this indicates that small day to day fluctuations in mobility are not of importance for the spread of the epidemic , but rather the overall connectivity amongst regions . Incorporation of random effects in the three components was also investigated to capture municipality - specific differences in transmission rate . Table S2 shows estimates of the best model from above ( Model 1 ) , the best model with a random within - municipality effect ( Model 2 ) , and the best model with a random between - municipality effect ( Model 3 ) . The model with random endemic intercept was also fitted but did not improve the fit and a model with random effects in the 3 components simultaneously resulted in convergence and estimation issues . Given that the best model ( Model 3 ) consisted of a random between - municipality effect signals the importance of the municipality - specific propensity for disease transmission from importation of new cases . Supplementary Figure S2 maps out the random effects estimates . While it is clear that there is heterogeneity amongst areas , as some areas have higher propensity than others , there is no clear spatial trend ob - served . Indeed , transmission from imported cases is a complex interplay between different factors that we have not studied in this analysis . 3 . 2 . Component contributions and model fit The choropleth maps ( to be interpreted together ) in Fig . 5 show the contribution to disease incidence of the within - and between - municipality autoregressive parts of the model ( the endemic compo - nent is not shown because of its negligible contribution ) . The within - municipality map identifies areas for which the epidemic evolution was primarily driven by a local epidemic process . The between - municipality map indicates regions in which incidence is primarily driven by spread of cases via mobility . This pertains to the susceptibility of each mu - nicipality to transmission via importation of new cases . From these maps , it can be observed that in the southern part of the country ( Walloon Region ) , the within - municipality spread is somewhat more important that the between - municipality spread ; while in northern part of the country ( Flemish Region ) the importance of the two varies a lot from municipality to municipality . This can be due to the fact that the Walloon Region is less densely populated as compared to the Flemish Region and to different contact patterns among their inhabitants . Figs . S3 and S4 show how the within - and between - contribu - tions change over time . It shows the important role of the between - municipality transmission in the summer period and during the early stage leading up to the second wave ( from July until mid October ) , while the within - municipality transmission was more important from mid - October until end of November ( which is the period of lockdown ) .

It shows that the importance of the epidemic spread between municipalities as compared to within munic - ipalities is more important in large cities , while the epidemic spread within the municipality is more important in small municipalities . Additionally , one - step ahead predictions ( retrospective ) and 2 - week forecasts for selected municipalities from the best model are made to investigate the predictive performance of the model . These are presented in Figure S5 , and plots show good model fit . 3 . 3 . Effect of mobility Finally , to better understand the impact of mobility amongst mu - nicipalities on the epidemic spread , different scenario analyses were investigated . Three scenarios were investigated via stochastic simula - tion as from October 19 : ( 1 ) assuming the mobility pattern as observed in October – December , ( 2 ) assuming a low mobility pattern ( similar as the mobility pattern in April during the first , and most strict , lockdown ( see Figure S1 ) , and ( 3 ) no mobility between municipalities , which means no connectivity at all between different municipalities . Confirmed cases up to 18 October were used as initial values for the simulation . Fig . 7 shows the results of the scenario analyses . The actual observed mobility describes the time evolution of the epidemic well , with the number of confirmed cases raising to around 500K ( Figure S6 ) . Results of the second scenario , assuming a reduction of mobility similar as to how it was during the lockdown period in April 2020 , could have greatly reduced the number of new infections , with a stabilization at around 300K confirmed cases . The third scenario , assuming no mobility among regions is an unrealistic scenario , but helps understanding the importance of mobility in sustaining the pandemic , as this scenario shows that without between - municipality mobility the epidemic spread would quickly fade out . Similar conclusions can be drawn based on the simulation results at municipality level , but in addition show that the impact of reducing the mobility would be largest for the more populated areas . Figure S7 shows the simulation results for some selected ( small , medium and large ) municipalities . In line with previous results , it is observed that a stricter lockdown , reducing the mobility , would have largest impact in the more populated areas such as in the cities of Antwerp , Brussels , Charlerloi and Liège . 4 . Discussion Using telecom - operator - based mobility data , ranging over 29 June to 13 December 2020 and a spatio - temporal dynamic model , the im - pact of mobility on the evolution of the epidemic at the level of the 581 Belgian municipalities is investigated . The model allows for separating the municipality - level case number evolution into relevant components : ( a ) an endemic component , ( b ) a within - municipality local epidemic component , and ( c ) a between - municipality mobility driven component . By decomposing incidence particularly into the within - and between - municipality components , we show that the second - wave of the COVID - 19 epidemic in Belgium was highly driven by between - municipality transmission . This was seen as one of the initial driving forces of the epidemic , apart from other factors such as higher exposure due to contact behavior , with some municipalities showing more sus - ceptibility to this mobility - induced transmission . It is noteworthy that this global epidemic component is relatively more important in larger Spatial and Spatio - temporal Epidemiology 45 ( 2023 ) 100568 6 C . Ensoy - Musoro et al . Fig . 6 . Contribution of Endemic , Within - and Between - Municipality infection rates for randomly selected small ( < 10k ) , medium ( > 25k and < 100k ) , and large ( > 100k ) municipalities in terms of population size . municipalities ( e . g . , cities ) , while the local component is more relevant in smaller ( rural ) municipalities . The use of mobility data in spatial models to describe the con - nectivity amongst regions is gaining more and more attention in the literature . It should be noted that there are different connectivity matrices that can be defined based on mobile phone data , conditional on availability of the data . For example , Slater et al . ( 2022 ) define the spatial dependence through both physical proximity and mobility effect ( Slater et al . , 2022 ) , while we define the connectivity based on the actual proportion of time spent in each municipality . A comparison of different definitions would be interesting for future research to give some guidance on best practices . Incorporation of the mobility data in the spatio - temporal epidemic model indicated a fixed mobility weight to fit better than a time - varying Spatial and Spatio - temporal Epidemiology 45 ( 2023 ) 100568 7 C . Ensoy - Musoro et al . Fig . 7 . Comparison of stochastic simulation predictions for the total number of infections using the actual observed mobility ( Scenario 1 ) , low mobility ( Scenario 2 ) , and assuming no mobility ( Scenario 3 ) . weight . This points to the possibility that the reduction in mobility during the lockdown period was not significant enough to affect the transmission dynamics . Stochastic simulation however revealed that if the reduction of mobility during mid - October until December would have been similar to that during the lockdown of April / May , then a significant reduction in the number of new infections would have been observed . This is our first attempt to encompass mobility data to construct spatial dependence in modeling epidemic spread . Our mobility data came from one telecom provider . Even though it holds the third largest market share in Belgium , its coverage is better in the Flemish Region while more variation is observed in the Walloon Region . In future projects , we will investigate whether additional data is available from multiple providers to assess the stability of mobility matrices . We implemented the spatio - temporal epidemic model under the hhh4 framework supported in the package surveillance , where in - ference is made via maximum likelihood estimation . It is also straight - forward to fit such model with Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling , as described in Wakefield et al . ( 2019 ) . Based on the results from this study and available literature , we can set up informative priors and proceed in the Bayesian framework for future work . The hhh4 model is also widely used for COVID - 19 modeling . Exam - ples can be found in Celani and Giudici ( 2022 ) , Giuliani et al . ( 2020 ) , Grimée et al . ( 2022 ) and Ssentongo et al . ( 2021 ) . We illustrated our ap - proach on the period from 29 June 2020 to 13 December 2020 , which can easily be extended to longer periods and with the inclusion of other covariates , e . g . vaccine coverage . Testing capacity before this period was limited , and hence the observed epidemic curve did not reflect the real situation . Nevertheless , it is also difficult to completely rule out or precisely assess the impact of under - reporting within the considered time frame , and this is a limitation of our study . For future research , it would be interesting to study the impact of underreporting on the different components in the model , especially when the underreporting is time - varying ( Bracher and Held , 2021 ) . The combination of mobility and social contact interventions im - plemented in Belgium clearly had an effect on the COVID - 19 transmis - sion dynamics . Further work is still required not only to completely disentangle the effect of different types of contacts in mobility and transmission pattern , but also to find the optimal balance between the negative effect of various interventions and the expected public health gain . Next to the impact of within - country mobility on the spread of COVID - 19 , investigation of the impact on incoming travel from other countries is still important .
