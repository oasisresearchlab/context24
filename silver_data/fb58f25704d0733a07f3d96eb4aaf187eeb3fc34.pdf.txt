LIN7 regulates the filopodia and neurite promot - ing activity of IRSp53 . J Cell Sci 2012 ; PMID : 22767515 .

The insulin receptor substrate protein of 53 kDa ( IRSp53 ) and the mammalian Diaphanous members of the formin family of proteins ( mDia ) are two key players in the formation of filo - podia and neurites . IRSp53 is an adaptor protein that acts at the membrane : actin interface , coupling membrane deforma - tion with F - actin polymerization . mDia formin proteins , instead , can nucleate and polymerize linear actin filaments . Emerging genetic and biochemical evi - dence indicate that there are multiple and independent pathways leading to filopodium and neurite formation , but the precise molecular components of these pathways remain ill - defined . We recently identified the PDZ domain - con - taining protein LIN7 as a novel regulator of IRSp53 . We further showed that the association between these two proteins is required to promote the formation of filopodia and neurites independently from mDia formin proteins , highlight - ing novel mechanisms of filopodia and neurite formation . Filopodia are dynamic actin - rich cell sur - face protrusions involved in cell migra - tion , axon guidance , and wound healing . 1 Plasma membrane protrusion and actin dynamics are essential events for filopo - dium formation and , by coupling these two events , the insulin receptor substrate protein of 53 kDa ( IRSp53 ) is a key player in this process . 2 - 5 Its N - terminal LIN7 - IRSp53 A novel pathway for filopodia and neurite formation ?

Binding of the Rho GTPase Cdc42 to a partial Cdc42 / Rac interactive binding motif ( CRIB ) located between the I - BAR and SH3 domains may activate IRSp53 by unmasking the SH3 domain . 7 The Diaphanous mDia1 and mDia2 members of the formin family of pro - teins are known for their ability to nucle - ate and polymerize linear actin filaments . Both of these formins have been linked to filopodium formation downstream of the Rho GTPase Rif . 8 , 9 Silencing of mDia1 reduced the number of filopodia induced by IRSp53 , while silencing of mDia2 did not affect IRSp53 - induced filopodium for - mation . 9 These data suggest that mDia1 may induce filopodium protrusions either by binding IRSp53 or independently , whereas mDia2 always functions in path - ways independent from IRSp53 . We have recently demonstrated that LIN7 , a PDZ protein interactor of IRSp53 , is a regulator of filopodia induced by IRSp53 . We showed that the forma - tion of filopodia containing actin fila - ments along their entire length depends on motifs contained in LIN7 and IRSp53 that mediate their association and filo - podia tip localization . We further dem - onstrated that the coexpression of LIN7 with IRSp53 enhances the formation of 632 Communicative & Integrative Biology Volume 5 Issue 6 References 1 . Mattila PK , Lappalainen P .

In neuronal N2A cells , the LIN7 - IRSp53 pathway may co - exists with the Rif - mDia1 / mDia2 pathway and with the one dependent on IRSp53 and mDia1 ( see Fig . 1 ) . Notably , the latter pathway has been demonstrated in a neuroblastoma cell line strictly related to the N2A cell line , although no data are available con - cerning the possibility that the IRSp53 - mDia1 pathway , together with filopodia formation , may also regulate neuritogen - esis . Further experiments will be required to elucidate the nature of these pathways and to understand the LIN7 functions in filopodia and neurite formation . filopodia in neuronal cells . In addition , downregulation of LIN7 inhibited dif - ferentiation of neuroblastoma N2A cells . A highly significant reduction of neurites was measured in LIN7 - silenced cells , and neuritogenesis was rescued by RNAi - resistant full length LIN7 or a chimeric LIN7 - IRSp53 fusion protein . In con - trast , LIN7 mutants lacking domains for association with IRSp53 ( PDZ domain ) or with plasma membrane protein com - plexes ( L27 domain ) failed to rescue neuritogenesis . Taken together , our data indicate that stable filopodia and neurite outgrowth depends on the IRSp53 asso - ciation with LIN7 . 10 Evidence indicate that neurites form by the dilation of stable filopodia . 11 Our data showing that LIN7 acts in the stabi - lization of actin filaments along filopodia indicate the presence of a pathway depen - dent on LIN7 and IRSp53 for neurito - genesis . However , the removal of LIN7 had no effects on filopodia and neurite formation induced by either mDia2 or mDia1 , since both formins , when indi - vidually overexpressed in LIN7 - silenced cells , were sufficient to restore completely Figure 1 .
