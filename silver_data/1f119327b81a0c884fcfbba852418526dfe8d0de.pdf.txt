Introduction Bladder cancer is one of the most common types of adult cancer . In 2008 alone , 386 , 000 pa - tients were diagnosed with bladder cancer which resulted in 150 , 200 deaths worldwide based on global statistics [ 1 ] . Metastasis is not only a hallmark of bladder cancer , but also the cause of mortality [ 1 ] . However , the pathophysiology of bladder cancer metastasis remains unclear . Chemokines , a superfamily of small secreted peptides characterized by their ability to induce leukocyte migration , together with their receptors have been found to be involved in the migra - tion of cells of the lymphoid system , thus may affect cancer development and progression [ 2 – 4 ] . CCL21 , an important chemokine of the CCL family , is one of the only two ligands ( the other one is CCL19 ) for CCR7 . [ 5 ] CCL21 is produced by fibroblastic reticular cells of the T - cell rich area in human and high endothelial venules in mice . [ 6 ] CCR7 is expressed by various types of lymphocytes including naive B and T cells , semimature and mature dendritic cells , and T regulatory cells [ 5 ] . In addition , the expression of CCR7 has been reported to promote cancer cell metastasis to lymph nodes in nonsmall cell lung cancer [ 7 ] , breast cancer [ 8 ] , squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck cancer [ 9 ] , colorectal cancer [ 10 ] , prostate cancer [ 11 ] , esophageal squamous cell cancer [ 12 ] and gastric cancer [ 13 ] . Therefore , CCR7 and its ligand ( s ) may par - ticipate in the proliferation , progression , and metastasis of cancer cells of various organ origins [ 7 – 13 ] . We also found that CCR7 was involved in the development and progression of bladder cancer ( unpublished data ) . Physiologically , CCL21 / CCR7 plays important roles in homing of immune cells , lymph - node homing and positioning , immunity and peripheral tolerance , development and function of T regulatory cells , and autoimmunity and lymphoid neogensis [ 5 ] . Various studies have con - firmed the roles of CCL21 / CCR7 in tumor development and progression [ 14 – 17 ] . For example , CCL21 / CCR7 promotes G2 / M phase progression and prevents apoptosis via the ERK pathway in human non - small cell lung cancer [ 15 , 16 ] , facilitates the progression of pancreatic cancer via induction of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis [ 14 ] , regulates matrix metalloproteinase - 9 ( MMP - 9 ) in human colon cancer metastasis [ 18 ] , and upregulates MMP - 9 in B - cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell migration and invasion [ 17 ] . Furthermore , CCL21 / CCR7 was also found to promote cancer cell migration into microlymphatic vessels in breast cancer [ 19 ] , pan - creatic tumor [ 20 ] , lung adenocarcinoma [ 21 ] , and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [ 22 ] . However , the possible role of CCL21 / CCR7 in bladder cancer development and progression re - mains unclear . T24 cells are derived from transitional cell carcinoma of human urinary bladder and have been extensively utilized for the study of bladder cancer [ 23 ] . The purposes of the present study were to investigate the effects of CCL21 / CCR7 on the proliferation , migration , and invasion of T24 cells and the possible associated mechanisms : ex - pression of MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 , and regulation of BCL - 2 and BAX proteins .

Cell culture and treatment T24 cells were treated for 48 hours prior to MTT assay , migration and invasion assays , and Western blot analysis and 24 hours prior to flow cytometry study . For each experiment , there were five groups consisting of Group 1 ( control group ) which was treated with serum free DMEM medium , Group 2 ( antibody group ) which first received pretreatment of 20 ng / mL of polyclonal rabbit anti - human CCR7 antibody for 4 h then 50 ng / ml of CCL21 , Group 3 which received 50 ng / ml of CCL21 , Group 4 which received 100 ng / ml of CCL21 , and Group 5 which received 200 ng / ml of CCL21 . The experiments of MTT assay , flow cytometry , and Western blot were repeated three times ( n = 3 ) , and cell migration and invasion were repeated four times ( n = 4 ) . MTT assay for the proliferation of T24 cells Proliferation of T24 cells was evaluated by MTT assay . In brief , cells were treated correspond - ingly in each group for 48 hours . Following treatment , the medium was removed and the cells were incubated with 5mg / mL of MTT solution ( 20 μ l ) . After incubation for 4 h at 37°C and 5 % CO2 , the supernatant was removed and formation of formazan was measured at 490 nm with Gel Documentation & Analysis System set ( Liuyi Factory , Beijing , China ) . Migration and invasion assays Cell migration and invasion were assayed using a transwell chamber ( EMD , Millipore , USA ) . For the invasion assay , a transwell chamber was placed into a 24 - well plate and was coated with 30 μ l Matrigel ( Franklin Lakes , USA ) and was incubated for one hour at 37°C . In both transwell assays , cells , after 48 hours ' corresponding treatment , were trypsinized and seeded in chambers at the density of 8 × 10 4 cells per well , and 500 μ l of serum free DMEM medium was added to the lower chamber . Migrated cells were fixed with 100 % Matrigel ( BD , Franklin Lakes , USA ) methanol for 30 min after 24 hours , and non - migrated Cells were removed by cot - ton swabs . Finally , cells on the bottom surface of the membrane were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for 20 min . Optical microscope ( 200X , Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) was used to count the number of cells in five random fields of view ; mean cell number was calculated for each group .

CCL21 promoted T24 cell proliferation in concentration - dependent manner with 200 ng / mL induced the largest amount of proliferation . Effects of CCL21 / CCR7 on the migration and invasion of T24 cells The results of CCL21 / CCR7 on the migration and invasion of T24 cells are presented in Fig . 1 . Cell counts for the migration and invasion studies are as the following : 45 . 5±11 . 6 and 28 . 6± 15 . 0 for the control group , 42 . 5±13 . 6 and 30 . 5±15 . 2 for the antibody group , 72 . 9±22 . 4 and 55 . 5±13 . 6 for CCRL21 100 ng / mL group , 115 . 7±18 . 8 and 102 . 1±18 . 0 for CCRL21 150 ng / mL group , and 178 . 9±8 . 4 and 143 . 7±24 . 4 for CCRL21 200 ng / mL group . Significant differences of cell migration were found between either of the three CCL21treatment groups and the control group in both the migration and invasion studies ( P < 0 . 001 for all ) ; but , no difference was found between the control group and the antibody group in either the migration study or the invasion study ( P > 0 . 05 for both ) . The effect of CCL21 / CCR7 treatment on T24 cell migration is concentration - dependent with the highest concentration of CCL21 ( 200 ng / ml ) produced the largest number of cells of migration / invasion . In general , smaller numbers of T24 cells were found in the invasion study than that of the corresponding migration study . Fig 1 .

Significant differences were found in the expression of MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 among the five groups ( p < 0 . 05 ) . As compared to the control group , the expressions of MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 proteins were significantly increased after three different concentra - tions of CCL21 treatment ( p < 0 . 05 for all ) . However , no difference was found in MMP - 2 or MMP - 9 between the control group and the antibody group ( p > 0 . 05 for both ) .

Early and late apoptosis rates and total cell death rates after treatments are presented in Table 3 . The rates of early apoptosis , late apoptosis and total cell death rates in the control group are 26 . 4 ± 5 . 0 % , 37 . 5 ± 2 . 4 % , and 63 . 9 ± 7 . 1 % , respectively ; whereas in the antibody group are 25 . 2 ± 3 . 8 % , 35 . 6 ± 5 . 5 % , and 60 . 8 ± 9 . 3 % , respectively .

Previous studies have demonstrated that chemokines are in - volved in the progression and metastasis of various cancers [ 2 , 4 , 5 ] . CCR7 is involved in cancer metastasis to lymph nodes in various cancers [ 7 – 13 ] . CCL21 participates in the proliferation of CD4 T cells , kidney mesangial cells , and various cancer cells [ 19 , 24 – 27 ] . Our study demon - strated for the first that CCL21 / CCR7 could increase T24 cell proliferation ( Table 1 ) , migration and invasion ( Fig . 1 ) . Chemokine concentration may be at least in part responsible for cancer development and metastasis [ 19 , 26 ] . As a result , we used three different concentrations of CCL21 in the present study and found a concentration dependent manner in CCL21 effects on T24 cell proliferation , migration , and invasion . CCL21 may strongly increase T24 cell migration and invasion at high concentrations and thus facilitate bladder cancer metastasis . Our findings are consistent with these previous reports . The interaction of chemokines and their receptors serve as the foundation for tumor cell motility and migration via triggering intracellular actin polymerization to create pseudopodia [ 28 , 29 ] . Muller et al found that CCL21 at100 nM induced a transient 1 . 6 - fold increase in intra - cellular flamentous actin ( F - actin ) in human breast cancer cells within 20 seconds and ob - served distinct pseudopodia formation after 20 min of stimulation with CCL21 [ 19 ] . The results of present study with T24 cell migration and invasion are consistent0020with these previous reports . Significant decrease in T24 cell numbers was observed when CCR7 antibody was used together with CCL21 and it indicates that effect of CCL21 depends on the activity of CCR7 . On the other word , CCL21 may activate CCR7 first and then affect T24 cell migration and invasion . Molecules like chemokine CCL21 are involved in the metastasis of cancers not only via me - diating the migration and invasion of cancer cells into tissues but also providing the required supportive microenvironments . In vivo , the migration of cancer cells is often slowed with lots of resistances , such as basement membrane and surrounding connective tissue [ 29 , 30 ] . There - fore , to mimic the real in vivo condition , we utilized transwell chamber coated with matrigel as a physical barrier for the present study . MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 are two proteins which are closely associated with bladder cancer metastasis [ 31 – 33 ] . Cancer cell invasion may require the secre - tion of MMPs such as MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 to degrade the matrigel . In the present study , we found that CCL21 could increase the expression of MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 and thus enhance cell invasion ( Fig . 2 and Table 2 ) . MMPs play important roles in cancer cell invasion ; but other fac - tors such as interleukins and E - cadherin may also contribute to tumor progression and Table 3 .

Nonetheless , CCL21 / CCR7 may facilitate cancer cell invasion via increasing MMP secretion and enhancing cell motility . Using radiolabled techniques , researchers have found only a tiny portion of radiolabled can - cer cells in microcirculations has the potential to metastasize [ 38 ] . The survival of cancer cells depends on their antiapoptotic abilities . When tumor cells leave its original tissues , they will lose some if not all the homeostatic factors which include chemokines for adhesion and sup - port ; thus the cells are prone to apoptosis . In the present study , the antiapoptotic ability of CCL21 inT24 cells were investigated using flow cytometry by annexin V - FITC / PI staining via ADM induced apoptosis . Phosphatidylserine ( PS ) can specifically bind annexin - V . PI , a nucle - ar staining agent , cannot cross normal cell membrane . In the early phase of apoptosis , PI nucle - ar staining cannot be detected as the cell membrane is intact . However , as cell undergoes apoptosis in the middle to late phases , cell membrane blebs and is no longer intact ; thus nucle - us can be detected through PI staining . The result of the flow cytometry can be divided into four quadrants : the lower left quadrant with normal alive cells [ Annexin - V ( − ) , PI ( − ) ] , the upper right quadrant [ Annexin - V ( + ) , PI ( + ) ] with late apoptotic or necrotic cells , the lower right quadrant [ Annexin - V ( + ) , PI ( − ) ] with early apoptotic cells , and the upper left quadrant [ Annexin - V ( − ) , PI ( + ) ] with small portions of cell debris due to mechanical injury and apoptosis . Thus , the analysis of apoptosis mainly depends on early apoptosis ( lower right quadrant ) and total cell death ( upper right + lower right quadrants ) in the present study . Our results demonstrated significant decrease of apopto - sis and cell death with CCL21 treatment compared to the control ( p < 0 . 01 ) ; however , no dif - ference between CCR7 antibody plus CCL21 treatment and the control was found ( p > 0 . 05 ) . The results indicate that CCR7 antibody could antagonize the effect of CCL21 on apoptosis and cell death and thus confirm the antiapoptotic function of CCL21 / CCR7 . However , no dif - ference of apoptosis was detected among the three treatment groups ( p > 0 . 05 ) . The possible cause could be that CCL21 at 50 ng / mL reached saturate condition thus higher concentrations could not further increase it effect . Bcl - 2 family is found to be closely related to cell apoptosis [ 39 – 41 ] . Bcl - 2 and Bax are the two most important proteins in the Bcl - 2 family with Bcl - 2 inhibiting apoptosis while Bax pro - moting apoptosis . These two proteins are present in dimers , such as Bcl - 2 / Bcl - 2 and Bax / Bax . Upregulation of Bcl - 2 expression will lead to the additional Bcl - 2 to combine with Bax forming Bcl2 / Bax thus inhibit cell apoptosis ; whereas with downregulation of the expression of Bcl - 2 , the quantity of the combined form of Bcl2 / Bax will decrease and thus promote cell apoptosis . In the present study , we investigated the expression of Bcl - 2 and Bax proteins in T24 cells in all experimental groups including the control . CCL21 could increase Bcl - 2 protein expression but decrease Bax protein expression and the effects exhibited a CCL21 concentration dependent manner between 50 ng / mL and 100 ng / ml . Interestingly , no significant difference was found in Bcl - 2 and Bax expressions between CCL21 at 100 ng / mL and 200 ng / ml CCL21 ( Bcl - 2 : p = 0 . 545 ; Bax : p = 0 . 191 ) ; the cause may be that CCL21 reached to a certain concentration no higher than 100 ng / mL for its maximal anti - apoptotic effects ( Fig . 3 ) . Pretreatment of CCR7 antibody could almost completely reverse the effect of CCL21 on the expressions of Bcl - 2 and Bax and apoptosis ( Fig . 3 and Table 3 ) . This further confirms the vital role of CCR7 on the ef - fects of CCL21 on T24 cells . Conclusion CCL21 / CCR7 promoted T24 cell proliferation in a concentration dependent pattern and en - hanced its migration and invasion ; these effects may be related to the increased expression of MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 . CCL21 / CCR7 had antiapoptotic activities on T24 cells ; these functions Effects of CCL21 / CCR7 on T24 Cells PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0119506 March 23 , 2015 9 / 12 may be related to the regulation of Bcl - 2 and Bax proteins . Our results indicate that CCL21 / CCR7 may promote bladder cancer development and metastasis . Author Contributions Conceived and designed the experiments : XBZ ZC .
