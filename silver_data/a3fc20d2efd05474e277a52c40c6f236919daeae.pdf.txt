The aim of this review was to ana - lyze epidemiological and clinical data , the consequences of the pandemic , and vaccination aspects in this group . Sources of data : The searches were carried out from January 2020 to November 2022 , in the MEDLINE databases ( PubMed ) and publications of the Brazilian Ministry of Health and the Brazil - ian Society of Pediatrics . Summary of ﬁ ndings : Covid - 19 has a mild presentation in most children ; however , the infection can progress to the severe form and , in some cases , to MIS - C . The prevalence of the so - called long Covid in children was 25 . 24 % . Moreover , several indirect impacts occurred on the health of children and adolescents . Vaccination played a crucial role in enabling the reduction of severe disease and mortality rates . Children and adolescents , as a special population , were excluded from the initial clinical trials and , therefore , vaccination was introduced later in this group . Despite its importance , there have been dif ﬁ culties in the ef ﬁ cient implementation of vaccina - tion in the pediatric population . The CoronaVac vaccines are authorized in Brazil for children over three years of age and the pediatric presentations of the P ﬁ zer vaccine have shown signi ﬁ - cant effectiveness and safety . Conclusions : Covid - 19 in the pediatric age group was responsible for the illness and deaths of a sig - ni ﬁ cant number of children . For successful immunization , major barriers have to be overcome . Real - world data on the safety and ef ﬁ cacy of several pediatric vaccines is emphasized , and the authors need a uniform message about the importance of immunization for all children . © 2022 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria .

Data from 6 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) of the 7 United States of America ( USA ) , which develops reliable sur - 8 veillance , indicate that , until September 21 , 2022 , children 9 in that country represented 17 . 4 % % of all con ﬁ rmed infec - 10 tions by SARSCoV - 2 and that about a quarter of those hospi - 11 talized for Covid - 19 required care in intensive care units 12 ( ICU ) . 1 Up to November 9 , 2022 , in the USA , 1 , 853 children 13 under 18 years of age of the US died from Covid - 19 , far 14 exceeding the 249 deaths in this age group due to seasonal 15 in ﬂ uenza in the same period , to make a parallel with 16 another viral respiratory infection for which vaccines are 17 available and routinely recommended . 2 , 3 18 During the initial phase of the pandemic , considering the 19 cases noti ﬁ ed to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , cover - 20 ing the period from December 30 , 2019 , to October 25 , 2021 , 21 it was observed that children under ﬁ ve represented 2 % 22 ( 1 , 890 , 756 ) of cases and 0 . 1 % ( 1 , 797 ) of global deaths . Chil - 23 dren aged 5 to 14 accounted for 7 % ( 7 , 058 , 748 ) of cases and 24 0 . 1 % ( 1 , 328 ) of global deaths , while older adolescents and 25 young adults ( 15 to 24 years ) accounted for 15 % ( 14 , 819 , 320 ) 26 of cases and 0 . 4 % ( 7 , 023 ) of the reported global deaths . How - 27 ever , the pandemic evolution has shown that the epidemiolog - 28 ical scenario has undergone important changes . Reported 29 cases of Covid - 19 among children increased dramatically in 30 the year 2022 , during the rise of the Omicron variant and its 31 various sub - lineages , at a time when most countries had dis - 32 continued the non - pharmacological measures to contain the 33 pandemic . For example , in the USA , in July 2022 , 14 , 003 , 497 34 cases were reported in children , which , at the time , repre - 35 sented 18 . 6 % of all reported cases , corresponding to 18 , 605 36 cases per 100 , 000 children in the population . Globally , up to 37 July 24 , 2022 , children under 5 and those aged 5 to 14 38 accounted for 2 . 47 % and 10 . 44 % of Covid - 19 cases , respec - 39 tively . Adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 24 years com - 40 prised 13 . 91 % of all cases . 4 41 Globally , it is estimated that 90 % of pediatric deaths from 42 Covid - 19 have occurred in low - and middle - income coun - 43 tries , with the highest mortality rates among children being 44 identi ﬁ ed in the group of infants younger than one year , a 45 re ﬂ ection of the great social inequalities and their differen - 46 tiated impact on human health . 5 A systematic review study , 47 which corroborated this evidence , concluded that a 20 - year - 48 old young individual was almost three times more likely to 49 die at the beginning of the pandemic in a low - or middle - 50 income country than in a high - income country . The higher 51 mortality rates in low - income countries are probably due to 52 poorer access to good - quality medical care , which would 53 make the development of strategies to prevent SARS - CoV - 2 54 infection even more relevant in this scenario of greater 55 adversity . 6 56 In Brazil , considering the ﬁ rst two years since the begin - 57 ning of the pandemic , it is estimated that Covid - 19 has killed 58 two children under the age of ﬁ ve per day , comprising a total 59 of 1 , 439 victims . The Northeast region accounted for almost 60 half of these deaths . The analysis of this initial period of the 61 pandemic in Brazil shows that children from 29 days to one 62 year old are the most vulnerable ones . Infants in this age 63 group accounted for almost half of the deaths recorded 64 among children under ﬁ ve years of age , which suggests the 65 importance of developing speci ﬁ c vaccines for this age 66 group , so they can also be effectively protected . Until June 67 2022 , data collected by the United Nations Children ' s Fund 68 ( UNICEF ) in 91 countries show that Covid - 19 was the under - 69 lying cause of death for 5 , 376 children under ﬁ ve years of 70 age worldwide . Brazil , therefore , accounted for about one 71 in ﬁ ve of these deaths . 7 , 8 72 The direct impact of Covid - 19 on the health of 73 children and adolescents 74 Although Covid - 19 has a mild presentation in the vast major - 75 ity of children , generally being considered a milder disease 76 when compared to adults , SARS - CoV - 2 infection can have a 77 severe evolution . Children with underlying medical condi - 78 tions are at increased risk of severe disease , although some 79 previously healthy children may also have this outcome . Cur - 80 rent evidence suggests that children with special health care 81 needs , including genetic conditions such as Down syndrome , 82 neurological or metabolic conditions , congenital heart dis - 83 ease , chronic encephalopathy , prematurity , dependence on 84 enteral nutrition , airway anomaly , severe uncontrolled 85 asthma , are at greater risk of developing severe forms of 86 Covid - 19 . Similar to what is observed among adults , children 87 with obesity , diabetes , asthma , chronic pulmonary disease , 88 sickle cell disease , or immunosuppression also constitute a 89 group of patients at increased risk of severe disease . 9 , 10 90 Although considered rare but serious , some children who 91 had Covid - 19 later developed Multisystem in ﬂ ammatory syn - 92 drome in children ( MIS - C ) . In the US , adjusted incidence 93 estimates of the occurrence of this syndrome were approxi - 94 mately 1 to 10 cases per 1 , 000 , 000 person - months , with esti - 95 mates varying with race / ethnicity , and age group . 11 Patients 96 with MIS - C usually present with persistent fever , cardiorespi - 97 ratory and gastrointestinal symptoms , mucocutaneous 98 lesions , and , in severe cases , hypotension and shock . Car - 99 diac , cardiorespiratory , and gastrointestinal complications 100 are the most common reasons for admission to intensive 101 care units , indicating the severity of this condition . 12 102 Moreover , children and adolescents aged 18 and under 103 who have had Covid - 19 are up to 2 . 5 times more likely to be 104 diagnosed with diabetes 30 days or more after the infection , 105 which highlights the importance of Covid - 19 prevention 106 strategies in this age group , including vaccination for all eli - 107 gible persons and prevention and treatment of chronic dis - 108 eases . 13 In another more recent study , it was observed that 109 new diagnoses of type 1 diabetes were more likely to occur 110 among pediatric patients with prior COVID - 19 than among 111 those with other respiratory infections . It is known that 112 respiratory infections have been associated with the onset 113 of diabetes , but in this study this risk was even higher among 114 those with Covid - 19 , raising concerns about long - term post - 115 Covid - 19 autoimmune complications among young people 116 and highlighting the need for the development of speci ﬁ c 117 treatments and preventive measures , such as vaccines . 14 ARTICLE IN PRESS JID : JPED [ mSP6P ; December 20 , 2022 ; 22 : 57 ] 2 E . J . Lima and R . D . Leite 118 In a systematic literature review study , the prevalence of 119 the so - called long Covid in children was 25 . 24 % , with the 120 most prevalent clinical manifestations of this condition 121 being mood swings ( 16 . 50 % ) , and fatigue ( 9 . 66 % ) . and sleep 122 disorders ( 8 . 42 % ) . Moreover , children infected with SARS - 123 CoV - 2 were at increased risk of persistent dyspnea , anos - 124 mia / ageusia , and / or fever compared to controls . Although 125 with limitations , such as the lack of standardized de ﬁ nitions , 126 loss of follow - up , and heterogeneity of the included studies , 127 this meta - analysis illustrates possible impacts of this condi - 128 tion , which may be underestimated , on child development 129 and school performance , for instance . 15 130 Indirect impact of Covid - 19 on the health of 131 children and adolescents 132 In addition to direct health problems , children and adoles - 133 cents have been disproportionately affected by Covid - 19 134 control measures . The most important indirect effects are 135 related to the closing of schools interrupting the provision of 136 educational services and increasing emotional distress and 137 mental health problems . When unable to attend school and 138 socially isolated , children are more prone to abuse , sexual 139 violence , teenage pregnancy , and child marriage , increasing 140 the likelihood of dropping out of school . Moreover , there 141 was an interruption in physical activities and routines and a 142 loss of access to a wide range of services provided by the 143 school , such as school lunches , health , nutrition , clean 144 water , sanitation and hygiene , and services aimed at chil - 145 dren with special needs , such as support for learning , speech 146 therapy , and social skills training . That is , there was a signi ﬁ - 147 cant worsening of pre - existing inequalities . 16 148 Role of children and adolescents in Covid - 19 149 transmission 150 Outbreaks of Covid - 19 have occurred in secondary schools , 151 summer camps , and daycare centers , demonstrating the 152 transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in settings where pediatric 153 patients predominate . Some preliminary evidence seems to 154 indicate that younger children may be less infectious , con - 155 sidering secondary attack rates , than adolescents and 156 adults . 17 157 The relationship between age , viral load , and transmis - 158 sion across the symptom spectrum of SARS - CoV - 2 infection 159 have not been fully investigated because people with no or 160 mild symptoms are rarely systematically tested . Thus , the 161 relative transmissibility of SARS - CoV - 2 at different ages 162 remains uncertain , largely due to the challenges involved in 163 pinpointing the in ﬂ uences of different factors , such as bio - 164 logical , host , virus and its variants , and environmental 165 factors . 18 166 More than two years after the start of the pandemic , a 167 better understanding of the role of children in the transmis - 168 sion of Covid - 19 has been the subject of studies and the data 169 gathered so far seem to indicate that they are less likely to 170 transmit Covid - 19 when compared to adults . Household 171 transmission remains the most prominent source of child - to - 172 adult and child - to - child transmission . However , more studies 173 are needed to better understand how childhood transmission 174 of Covid - 19 has been impacted by the reopening of schools 175 and the advancement of vaccines , as well as the emergence 176 of new variants of SARS - Cov - 2 . 19 177 Inclusion of the pediatric population as a target 178 audience for vaccines against Covid - 19 179 Vaccination has played a crucial role in the ﬁ ght against 180 Covid - 19 , allowing the reduction of rates of severe illness 181 and mortality , in addition to restricting the spread of the dis - 182 ease , which has been the main factor in controlling the pan - 183 demic . 20 If the disease in the pediatric population is not 184 controlled , children may become a reservoir of the virus , 185 leading to epidemics in the community . 21 - 23 186 With the shared effort of government authorities , phar - 187 maceutical companies , and the scienti ﬁ c community , a num - 188 ber of Covid - 19 vaccines have been widely used in the adult 189 population . Children and adolescents , as a special popula - 190 tion , were generally excluded from the initial clinical trials 191 and , therefore , the vaccination was introduced later in this 192 group . 24 For example , in Brazil , the inactivated virus vaccine 193 by the pharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech ( Corona - 194 Vac ) received conditional approval for the immunization of 195 the pediatric population aged over three years , and the mes - 196 senger RNA ( mRNA ) vaccine BNT162b2 , developed in collab - 197 oration with P ﬁ zer and BioNTech laboratories , was 198 successively authorized for use in adolescents aged 12 to 199 18 years , later children aged ﬁ ve to 11 years with a special 200 presentation containing one - third of the standard dose and 201 which subsequently received authorization from the US reg - 202 ulatory agency Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the 203 Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency ( ANVISA ) for 204 another pediatric presentation , corresponding to one - tenth 205 of the adult dose , for use in children aged 6 months to 206 4 years . 23 - 27 207 Despite the crucial importance of vaccines in controlling 208 the pandemic , there have been dif ﬁ culties in ef ﬁ cient vac - 209 cine implementation . 23 , 24 The introduction of effective vac - 210 cines against SARS - CoV - 2 , initially in school - aged children 211 and adult populations , combined with the emergence of 212 new variants of SARS - CoV - 2 , with greater transmission 213 capacity , resulted in a proportional increase in infections in 214 younger children . 27 Moreover , unfortunately , inequalities in 215 the distribution of vaccines , vaccine hesitancy , misinforma - 216 tion , and political complexities , make vaccination coverage 217 insuf ﬁ cient to contain the pandemic . 21 218 Immunogenicity of vaccines against Covid - 19 in 219 the pediatric population 220 Overall , evidence of good immunogenicity has been 221 observed for vaccines against Covid - 19 in children . In most 222 studies , comparable humoral antibody responses were 223 observed regarding neutralizing antibody titers in children 224 and adults . The BNT162b2 vaccine , in adolescents aged 12 - 225 15 years , showed that the geometric mean of antibodies was 226 1 . 7 - fold higher than that observed in the group aged 16 to 227 25 years ; among children aged 5 to 11 years , the geometric ARTICLE IN PRESS JID : JPED [ mSP6P ; December 20 , 2022 ; 22 : 57 ] 3 Jornal de Pediatria xxxx ; xxx ( xxx ) : xxx - xxx 228 mean of antibodies was identical to that observed in the 229 group aged 16 to 25 years . Even the group of infants aged 6 230 to 23 months reached geometric means identical to those 231 obtained in the group aged 16 to 25 years , bearing in mind 232 that the infants received one - tenth of the dose used in the 233 group aged 16 to 25 years . The only exception was the group 234 aged 2 to 5 years , which required 3 doses to reach non - infe - 235 riority . 28 - 30 236 Regarding the need for booster doses , data from Zhu et 237 al . 31 indicated that there was no increase in cellular immu - 238 nity after an additional vaccine dose . This result , however , 239 must be interpreted with caution , due to the limited data on 240 the cellular immune response and the observation that , 241 after the circulation of the Omicron variant , the need for 242 booster doses also in adolescents became more evident . 32 243 The initial phase I and II studies of the CoronaVac vaccine , 244 involving children and adolescents aged three to 17 years of 245 age , demonstrated that antibody seroconversion rates were 246 greater than 96 % . 33 247 Ef ﬁ cacy and effectiveness of vaccines against 248 Covid - 19 in the pediatric population 249 The published initial results regarding the BNT162b2 vaccine 250 ( P ﬁ zer ) in adolescents were based on a phase III study , which 251 included 2 , 126 participants aged 12 to 15 years . 34 Most partic - 252 ipants were white ( 85 % ) , 90 % of adolescents had had no previ - 253 ous contact with SARS - CoV - 2 , and immunocompromised 254 adolescents were not included in the study . the randomization 255 was 1 : 1 ( vaccine and placebo ) with a 21 - day interval between 256 the doses . The geometric mean ratio of neutralizing antibod - 257 ies after the second dose in adolescents aged 12 to 15 years , 258 compared to the group aged 16 to 25 years , was 1 . 76 ( 95 % 259 con ﬁ dence interval [ CI ] , 1 . 47 to 2 . 10 ) , thereby proving non - 260 inferiority ( lower limit of 95 % CI greater than 0 . 67 ) . 261 Effectiveness studies have been published , with real - 262 world data after the introduction of the BNT162b2 vaccine 263 ( P ﬁ zer ) , in some countries such as the USA , Israel , and the 264 United Kingdom . In Israel , a retrospective cohort study esti - 265 mated the vaccine effectiveness in adolescents aged 12 to 266 15 years vaccinated with two separate doses , with a 21 - day 267 interval between them . The results showed a 91 . 5 % effec - 268 tiveness ( CI 88 . 2 % - 93 . 9 % ) . At the follow - up , none of the vac - 269 cinated adolescents was hospitalized after the second dose 270 of the vaccine . 35 , 36 271 In the USA , after the introduction of the vaccination in 272 adolescents , a case - control study showed the effectiveness 273 of two doses of the P ﬁ zer / BioNTech vaccine against hospital - 274 ization due to Covid - 19 . Similar to the data from Israel , the 275 effectiveness of two doses of the P ﬁ zer / BioNTech vaccine 276 against hospitalization for Covid - 19 was 93 % ( 95 % CI = 83 % - 277 97 % ) . During the study period , the Delta variant was the pre - 278 dominant one and there were 77 ICU admissions . The 29 ado - 279 lescents were considered to have severe cases of the disease 280 and the two deaths occurred in the non - immunized group . 37 - 281 39 As for MIS - C , a US study demonstrated a P ﬁ zer / BioNTech 282 vaccine effectiveness of 91 % ( 95 % CI = 78 % - 97 % ) . 40 283 After its successful use in the 12 - 17 age group , the CDC 284 released , in November 2021 , a presentation of the P ﬁ zer 285 vaccine containing one - third of the standard dose , therefore 286 10 mcg , aimed at children aged ﬁ ve to 11 years . The 287 approval of this presentation was supported by the analysis 288 of real - world data in this age group during the circulation of 289 the Omicron variant , after the initial studies that de ﬁ ned 290 the dose for this age group and the safety pro ﬁ le . 41 In phase 291 II / III studies , the objectives were to evaluate safety , tolera - 292 bility , and immunogenicity by demonstrating the non - inferi - 293 ority of neutralizing antibody response . As secondary 294 objectives , the effectiveness of disease prevention was veri - 295 ﬁ ed . A 90 . 7 % ef ﬁ cacy ( 95 % CI = 67 . 7 to 98 . 3 % ) was demon - 296 strated for the prevention of Covid - 19 , at least seven days 297 after the second dose . Regarding adverse events , the vac - 298 cine showed a good safety pro ﬁ le . 41 - 43 299 Subsequent studies evaluated the use of a presentation 300 with one - tenth of the standard dose in children aged six 301 months to four years , which was released for this group in a 302 primary schedule with three doses with 21 - day intervals 303 between the ﬁ rst and second doses and two months between 304 the second and the third dose . In September 2022 , ANVISA , 305 based on prior authorization from other regulatory agencies 306 such as the FDA , authorized the use of this new presentation 307 also in Brazil . 44 The Ministry of Health started the vaccina - 308 tion with this pediatric presentation in November but has 309 currently restricted the use for children with comorbidities 310 only . Scienti ﬁ c societies such as the Brazilian Society of Pedi - 311 atrics ( Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria ) have vehemently 312 opposed the vaccination of children with comorbidities only , 313 a strategy that is dif ﬁ cult to implement , especially in the 314 poorest regions of the country , precisely where vaccine pro - 315 tection is most needed . The delay in starting vaccination for 316 all children in this age group , especially at times of 317 increased viral circulation , has enormous impacts on the 318 children ’ s health . The imminent risk of Covid - 19 in the pedi - 319 atric population is evident . 45 320 The authors emphasize that tens of thousands of hospital - 321 izations due to Covid - 19 in children and adolescents and 322 among the thousands of deaths , as well as among cases of 323 MIS - C , the majority occurred in previously healthy children , 324 highlighting once again the need not to restrict the availabil - 325 ity and recommendations of vaccines to higher risk groups 326 only . 327 In a study on the effectiveness of the SinoVac vaccine 328 conducted in Chile , the estimated effectiveness of the Coro - 329 naVac vaccine in children aged 3 to 5 years during the Omi - 330 cron outbreak was 38 . 2 % ( 95 % CI 36 . 5 - 39 . 9 ) for the 331 prevention of COVID - 19 , 64 . 6 % ( 95 % CI , 49 . 6 - 75 . 2 ) for pre - 332 vention of hospitalization and 69 . 0 % ( 95 % CI , 18 . 6 - 88 . 2 ) for 333 prevention of ICU admission related to COVID - 19 . 46 334 In July 2022 , ANVISA authorized the use of the CoronaVac 335 vaccine in the pediatric population in Brazil , for use in chil - 336 dren aged three years or older , in a two - dose schedule with 337 a 28 - day interval , without a history of immunosuppression , a 338 situation in which mRNA vaccines should be used . 27 339 There is evidence that vaccination can reduce the risk of 340 MIS - C . One study reported that post - vaccination MIS - C in 341 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years occurred at a rate of 1 . 5 per 342 million total vaccine recipients ( 95 % CI 0 . 8 - 2 . 6 ) . 47 In con - 343 trast , 113 cases of MIS - C were observed among one million 344 SARS - CoV - 2 infections in the same age group . 48 MIS - C pre - 345 vention is important because affected infants and adoles - 346 cents may face long - term health sequelae that are not yet 347 known .

Leite 348 Vaccination of pregnant and lactating women 349 against Covid - 19 and child protection 350 CoV - 2 infection prevention methods in infants also include pro - 351 tection induced by maternal vaccination . Although they were 352 excluded from clinical trials , effectiveness studies have shown 353 that pregnant women bene ﬁ ted signi ﬁ cantly from the vaccina - 354 tion . 49 - 51 Moreover , mothers vaccinated before or during preg - 355 nancy transfer speci ﬁ c antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 to their 356 babies via transplacental transmission and through breast milk 357 with the possibility of additional protection in young 358 infants . 52 , 53 However , this passive protection will only protect 359 the baby for the ﬁ rst six to 12 months of life before maternal 360 antibodies decline , and with the low durability and continued 361 evolution of the virus , maternal antibodies are likely to protect 362 for a few months . Even when breastfeeding is continued until 363 the second year of life , the decline in antibodies induced by 364 the vaccine and the limited uptake of antibodies from breast 365 milk into the circulation would likely result in titers that are 366 too low to protect the infant against infection . 49 It is notewor - 367 thy that young infants are one of the most frequently hospital - 368 ized pediatric populations for SARS - CoV - 254 infection and most 369 of these children do not have comorbidities . Recent studies 55 - 370 57 evaluated maternal - child protection for the fetus . 371 Thus , it is likely that in the near future , protection 372 against severe Covid - 19 for all children will require new 373 studies with vaccination in children under six months of age . 374 Safety and adverse events of Covid - 19 vaccines 375 for children and adolescents 376 Concerns about safety and the appearance of adverse events 377 are always present regarding any new vaccine . The rare 378 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis that were observed in 379 adolescents and young adults , especially those receiving 380 mRNA platform vaccines , seem to be dose - and interval - 381 dependent , and pharmacovigilance data have identi ﬁ ed 382 occurrences of rarely reported cases in the age group of 5 to 383 11 years . 58 - 60 384 A follow - up study of adolescents in Israel indicated that 385 BNT162b2 vaccine - induced myocarditis in adolescents seems 386 to be a rare adverse event , occurring predominantly in male 387 individuals after the second dose of the vaccine . The clinical 388 course seems to be mild and benign over a six - month follow - 389 up period , and cardiac imaging ﬁ ndings suggest a favorable 390 long - term prognosis 61 and , although some patients still had 391 minor cardiac abnormalities , they occurred at a signi ﬁ cantly 392 lower rate than after SARS - CoV - 2 infection . 62 , 63 393 The number of participants in clinical trials conducted 394 in young children ( < 5 years ) is too low to detect rare 395 events , but considering the lower doses being used in 396 this population and the relatively rare occurrence of 397 myocarditis in this age group in general , the associated 398 risk of myocarditis in infants aged six months to 5 years 399 is unlikely to be identi ﬁ ed .

Among the data from 407 Chile , when more than three million doses of the vaccine had 408 already been administered , only 319 adverse events were 409 reported and most of them were considered non - severe . 410 For inactivated vaccines ( CoronaVac ) , 33 in general , 411 adverse reactions were also more important in older chil - 412 dren , similar to the results of comparisons of RNA vaccines . 413 To evaluate the adverse reactions to different doses of 414 vaccines , two randomized controlled studies 33 , 64 showed 415 information on children and adolescents aged three to 416 17 years after receiving different doses of inactivated vac - 417 cines . The data suggest acceptable safety and tolerability 418 pro ﬁ les for several used doses of inactivated vaccines . 419 Covid - 19 vaccination for children and 420 adolescents 421 In Brazil , the vaccines approved in the pediatric group , 422 with their respective ages , are described in Figure 1 . 65 423 Figure 2 depicts the vaccination schedule recommended 424 for the administration of the P ﬁ zer “ Baby ” vaccine in 425 children aged six months to 4 years . 45 As expected , there 426 may be changes in the recommendations depending on 427 the epidemiological scenario and the accumulation of 428 new knowledge . 429 Covid - 19 vaccines are the subject of some controversies 430 and discussions . One of the most frequent questions is 431 whether children or adults who have already had the disease 432 need to receive the vaccine , since , theoretically , they have 433 natural antibodies after the infection . It has been shown 434 that people with a previous history of Covid - 19 have 435 enhanced immune responses when vaccinated , concluding 436 that , in this situation , having had the disease and Figure 2 Schedule with P ﬁ zer baby presentation (cid:1) 6 months to 4 years .

Leite 437 subsequently being vaccinated , is the combination that 438 would result in a more robust immune response . 21 439 In the presence of mild to moderate SARS - Cov - 2 infec - 440 tion , the Covid - 19 vaccine can be administered four weeks 441 after the infection . When the condition is severe ( including 442 MIS - C ) , the Covid - 19 vaccine should be administered three 443 months after the resolution of the condition , after assessing 444 the individual ’ s health conditions . 66 445 Regarding the other vaccines in the vaccination calendar 446 and previous infection by SARS - CoV - 2 , the current guideline 447 is to vaccinate the child with routine immunizations immedi - 448 ately after clinical improvement , and currently there may 449 be simultaneous administration of Covid - 19 vaccines with 450 other vaccines included in the children ' s routine calendar . 30 451 Considering the general bene ﬁ ts for society and the chil - 452 dren themselves , it is imperative to improve measures to 453 support Covid - 19 vaccination in the pediatric population and 454 expand the protected groups . 63 One situation that requires 455 more information is the use of these vaccines in immuno - 456 compromised pediatric populations . Immunosuppressed ado - 457 lescents aged 12 to 17 years have a special schedule with the 458 P ﬁ zer vaccine , with an additional dose two months after D2 459 and a booster dose four months after the additional dose . 65 460 The bene ﬁ ts of vaccinating children with the SARS - CoV - 2 461 vaccines far outweigh the risks of acquiring the infection 462 when unvaccinated , making the vaccine as important for 463 children ' s health as other routine vaccines . 66 - 69 464 The advantages of early immunization against SARS - CoV - 2 465 include the following : ( 1 ) protection against SARS - CoV - 2 466 infection and severe acute Covid - 19 in infants and children ; 467 ( 2 ) protection against Covid - 19 post - infectious in ﬂ ammatory 468 syndromes such as MIS - C ; ( 3 ) potential protection against 469 long - lasting Covid - 19 sequelae and long Covid ; ( 4 ) reduced 470 transmission between families and in schools ; ( 5 ) Long - last - 471 ing and strong humoral responses can be obtained early in 472 life through existing SARS - CoV - 2 vaccines at lower doses , 473 reducing side effects and adverse events . 70 , 71 474 Moreover , parental fear of Covid - 19 is an important factor 475 that in ﬂ uences the decision to vaccinate children . 72 There - 476 fore , to enhance valid parental perceptions of Covid - 19 , 477 governments should proactively provide scienti ﬁ c communi - 478 cation and share data in a timely manner . Commitment to 479 child health must begin with the elimination of vaccine hesi - 480 tancy . 481 Effective vaccines have been developed , and it is up to 482 government agencies to devise and implement the means to 483 ensure the production and distribution of suf ﬁ cient vaccines 484 to populations of all ages in high - , middle - , and low - income 485 countries , in urban and rural areas , and at an accessible 486 cost . To succeed in these efforts , the authors also need to 487 overcome vaccine hesitancy , including for children . There - 488 fore , politicians , health professionals , and scientists must 489 work together and provide critical real - world data on the 490 safety and ef ﬁ cacy of vaccines , as well as a uniform message 491 on the importance of vaccination to ensure protection 492 against the effects of the Covid - 19 pandemic for all 493 populations . 73 494 The authors must clearly communicate the characteris - 495 tics of the available pediatric vaccines , how they work , 496 what their limitations are , and why the bene ﬁ ts outweigh 497 the risks 74 . The authors must take advantage of the global 498 successes of the well - established pediatric vaccine regimens 499 used in routine vaccination schedules , providing a better 500 chance of success in overcoming the unprecedented global 501 effects of this pandemic . 502 Uncited references Q2 X X 503 54 , 74 504 Con ﬂ icts of interest 505 The authors declare no con ﬂ icts of interest 506 Authors ’ contributions 507 EJFL and RDL were in charge of the study concept and 508 design , reviewed the databases for data acquisition , 509 wrote the initial manuscript , and critically reviewed the 510 intellectual content of the manuscript .
