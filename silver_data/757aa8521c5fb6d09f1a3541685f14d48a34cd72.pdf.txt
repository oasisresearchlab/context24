L E T T E R S 420 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 6 | NUMBER 5 | MAY 2004 PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 binding is necessary for WAVE2 - induced formation of lamellipodia Tsukasa Oikawa 1 , 3 , Hideki Yamaguchi 2 , Toshiki Itoh 1 , 3 , Masayoshi Kato 1 , 3 , Takeshi Ijuin 1 , 3 , Daisuke Yamazaki 1 , 3 , Shiro Suetsugu 1 , 3 and Tadaomi Takenawa 1 , 3 Polarized cell movement is triggered by the development of a PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 gradient at the membrane , which is followed by rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton . The WASP family verprolin homologous protein ( WAVE ) is essential for lamellipodium formation at the leading edge by activating the Arp2 / 3 complex downstream of Rac GTPase . Here , we report that WAVE2 binds to PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 through its basic domain . The amino - terminal portion of WAVE2 , which includes the PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - binding sequence , was localized at the leading edge of lamellipodia induced by an active form of Rac ( RacDA ) or by treatment with platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) . Production of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 at the cell membrane by myristoylated phosphatidylinositol - 3 - OH kinase ( PI ( 3 ) K ) is sufficient to recruit WAVE2 in the presence of dominant - negative Rac and latrunculin , demonstrating that PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 alone is able to recruit WAVE2 . Expression of a full - length mutant of WAVE2 that lacks the lipid - binding activity inhibited proper formation of lamellipodia induced by RacDA . These results suggest that one of the products of PI ( 3 ) K , PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , recruits WAVE2 to the polarized membrane and that this recruitment is essential for lamellipodium formation at the leading edge . Cell migration is one of the ways that cells respond to signals from the extracellular environment . It supports various cellular processes , ranging from the mating of yeast and chemotaxis of single cells , to immune responses , wound healing and neurite outgrowth in higher organisms . Receptor molecules on the plasma membrane sense the locations and intensities of extracellular signals and determine the appropriate direction for cell movement . Recent studies have revealed important roles of membrane lipids and the cytoskeleton in cell migration 1 – 4 . It is clear that cells induce the formation of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 at the leading edge to establish cell polarity in response to chemoattractant gradients . However , the mechanism of how this polarity is followed by the formation of the leading edge is still obscure . The state of the actin cytoskeleton is regulated by Rho subfamily GTPases , such as Rho , Rac and Cdc42 , which are also known to have important roles in cell migration 5 , 6 . Rac is essential for lamellipodium extension at the leading edge of the migrating cell , and Cdc42 is important for filopodium extension 5 , 7 . The WASP ( Wiscott - Aldrich syndrome protein ) and WAVE families are effector proteins that function downstream of Rho GTPases to regulate the actin cytoskeleton 8 . Members of the WASP family interact with Cdc42 and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to become active . Activation of WASP exposes the VCA ( verprolin homology , cofilin homology and acidic ) region , which can then bind to the Arp2 / 3 complex and initiate rapid polymerization of actin 9 , 10 . A cluster of basic amino - acid residues in the N - terminal half of N - WASP proteins is essential for PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding 9 , 10 . In con - trast , members of the WAVE family function downstream of Rac to induce lamellipodium formation through activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex by means of its VCA domain 11 , 12 . All WAVE isoforms ( WAVE1 , 2 and 3 ) also have basic domains near the WAVE homology domain ( WHD ) 13 . However , the roles of these domains in interactions with phosphoinositides are not known . WAVE2 is expressed ubiquitously in various tissues , whereas WAVE1 and WAVE3 are expressed primarily in the brain . So far , sev - eral researchers have reported that WAVE2 is crucial for lamel - lipodium formation at the leading edge 8 , 14 – 16 . However , the molecular mechanisms underlying localization of WAVE2 at the leading edge are poorly understood . We examined binding of the basic region of WAVE2 to phospho - inositides with an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . We found that the pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain of phospho - lipase C δ 1 ( PLC δ 1 ) showed the strongest affinity for PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and the PH domain of Akt interacted specifically with PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , which were included as positive controls 17 . We generated a series of truncated forms of WAVE2 and assessed their abilities to interact with various phos - phoinositides ( Fig . 1A ) . As shown in Fig . 1B , full - length WAVE2 protein bound preferen - tially to PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . WHDB , which contains WHD and the basic region but lacks the carboxy - terminal region , also bound most strongly to PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , indicating this region is sufficient for proper specificity of phosphoinositide binding . In contrast , WHD alone ( Fig . 1B , a ) did not bind to any of the phosphoinositides , indi - cating that the basic region is required for proper binding . As expected , the basic region alone ( Fig . 1B , e ) bound to phosphoinosi - tides comparable to those of WHDB . 1 Department of Biochemistry and 2 Division of Cancer Genomics , Institute of Medical Science , University of Tokyo , 4 - 6 - 1 Shirokanedai , Minato - ku , Tokyo 108 - 8639 , Japan . 3 CREST , Japan Science and Technology Corporation ( JST ) , Minato - ku , Tokyo 108 - 8639 , Japan Correspondence should be addressed to T .

We termed the first half of the region containing these five residues as Basic1 ( residues 171 – 183 ) and the second half Basic2 ( residues 184 – 201 ) ( Fig . 1C ) . Interestingly , truncated WHDB ( Fig . 1B , b ) , which lacks the Basic2 region , showed binding ability , although it was weaker than that of WHDB . The Basic1 region alone ( Fig . 1B , g ) bound phos - phoinositides similar to the whole basic region ( Fig . 1B , e ) , but the Basic2 region alone ( Fig . 1B , d ) did not bind phosphoinositides . These results indicated that the Basic1 region is necessary and sufficient for phosphoinositide binding .

( A ) Schematic diagrams of truncated WAVE2 proteins . The basic region of WAVE2 is divided into two regions : Basic1 ( residues 171 – 183 ) and Basic2 ( residues 184 – 201 ) . Five amino - acid residues in the Basic1 region were each mutated to Ala in the full A5 mutant ( A5mut ) , c , f and h constructs . ( B ) Quantification of the ability of the different WAVE2 constructs to bind to phosphoinositides . ELISA was performed with GST as a negative control and GST – PLC δ 1PH or GST – AktPH as a positive control . GST - tagged proteins ( 1 . 0 µ g ml − 1 ) were overlaid on lipid vesicles ( PE / PC / PIPx = 1 / 1 / 0 . 2 µ g ) . In each assay , values were normalized so as to show binding of PLC δ 1PH to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 as 1 . 0 . Error bars represent the standard deviation of at least three independent experiments . ( C ) Amino - acid sequences of the basic regions of all WAVE isoforms ( WAVE1 , 2 and 3 ) and N - WASP . Amino - acid residues with asterisks are conserved in all WAVE isoforms , and those with dots are not conserved but are basic in all WAVE isoforms .

Liposomes ( PC / PtdIns / PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 or PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 = 48 / 48 / 4 ) at indicated concentrations were mixed with 10 µ g of GST - fused WAVE2 protein and co - sedimented .

The kinetics data are listed in Supplementary Information , Table 1 . print ncb1125 16 / 4 / 04 11 : 37 AM Page 421 © 2004 Nature PublishingGroup L E T T E R S 422 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 6 | NUMBER 5 | MAY 2004 We then prepared constructs with a mutant ( A5mut ) in which the five basic residues of the Basic1 region were replaced with alanines by site - directed mutagenesis ( Fig . 1C ) . The constructs with mutants lack - ing the five basic residues did not bind phosphoinositides , suggesting the importance of these residues for binding ( Fig . 1B , A5mut , c , f and h ) . Importantly , the binding specificity of the basic region alone dif - fered from that of WHDB ( Fig . 1B ) . The basic region preferentially bound PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , whereas WHDB showed a stronger preference for PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , similarly to the full - length protein . These data suggest that specificity of phosphoinositide bind - ing is dependent on WHD in WAVE2 . Thus , we termed this region ( WHD plus Basic1 ) WAVE2 - N . The specificity of lipid binding was also tested by co - sedimentation assay with lipid vesicles ( Fig . 1D ) . In this assay , PH domains from PLC δ 1 and Akt were preferentially co - sedimented with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , respectively , as reported earlier . Full - length wild - type WAVE2 co - sedimented with PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 more efficiently than with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , demonstrat - ing its preference for PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in the lipid bilayer . We also con - firmed the binding specificity and affinity of WAVE2 for PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 with dual polarization interferometer ( DPI ) technol - ogy 18 . In this assay , the dissociation constant ( K D ) of PH domains from PLC δ 1 and Akt in relation to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 were determined ; these values were in good agreement with previous studies . The K D of full - length WAVE2 for PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 was 185 nM , whereas that for PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was 1 . 2 µ M ( Fig . 1E and Supplementary Information , Table 1 ) . The K D was calculated from curve fitting and the errors for each point from the fitted curve were within ± 0 . 01 % and ± 0 . 03 % , respectively . From these three independ - ent assays , we conclude that WAVE2 binds preferentially to PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 rather than to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in vitro . To assess the importance of the interaction between the Basic1 region and phosphoinositides in WAVE2 function in cultured cells , we prepared constructs of WAVE2 - N ( residues 1 – 183 ) that were tagged with green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) at the C terminus ( Fig . 2a ) . To investigate the effect of the Basic1 region on the localization of WAVE2 - N , we examined the localization of GFP - tagged WAVE2 - N during RacDA - induced lamellipodia formation in NIH3T3 cells . Wild - type WAVE2 - N , which has the wild - type Basic1 region , was localized along the leading edges ( Fig . 2b ) ; however , WAVE2 - N A5mut , which has a mutation in the Basic1 region , was not localized along the leading edges ( Fig . 2c ) . Rac is activated downstream of PI ( 3 ) K through binding of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 to Rac guanine nucleotide - exchange factors 19 , 20 . In addition , activation of Rac induces PI ( 3 ) K activation by a positive - feedback loop through the actin cytoskele - ton 21 , 22 . When RacDA was expressed in these cells , activation of PI ( 3 ) K was also observed ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) . Actually , PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 accumulation at RacDA - induced lamellipodia was observed when PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 distribution was monitored with the PH domain of Akt ( data not shown ) . Therefore , localization of WAVE2 - N to the leading edge seems to be caused by PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . To further confirm the PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - dependent translocation of WAVE2 , a series of experiments were performed . First , we exam - ined whether WAVE2 - N still localizes at the cell periphery after PI ( 3 ) K activation in the presence of a dominant - negative form of Rac ( RacDN ) . Translocation of wild - type WAVE2 - N to the plasma membrane was dependent on growth - factor stimulus , even in the presence of RacDN ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1b ) . This translocation was abolished in the presence of the PI ( 3 ) K inhibitor , wortmannin ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S1b ) . We next examined the localization of WAVE2 - N in the presence of membrane - targeted PI ( 3 ) K p110 α activated by myristoylation ( Myr - p110 α ) ( ref . 23 ) . WAVE2 - N colocalized with Myr - p110 α at the cell membrane even in the presence of RacDN and latrunculin B , but not in the presence of wortmannin 23 , 24 ( Fig . 2d ) . a b c d WAVE2 - N wild type WAVE2 - N A5mut 1 183 1 183 WHD b1 GFP WHD b1 GFP Actin WAVE2 - N wild type RacDA Merge Actin WAVE2 - N A5mut RacDA Merge Myr - p110 α WAVE2 - N wild type RacDN Merge Rac − Rac + Rac − Rac + N o n - t r ea t e d + l a t r un c u li n + w o r t m a nn i n Figure 2 WAVE2 - N is localized at Rac - induced lamellipodia and colocalizes with Myr - p110 α in the presence of RacDN .

These findings suggest that the interaction between the Basic1 region and phosphoinositides is important for recruitment of WAVE2 to the leading edge . We then compared the localization of wild - type WAVE2 with that of phosphoinositides . As with wild - type WAVE2 - N , wild - type WAVE2 ( Fig . 3A ) was localized at the RacDA - induced leading edge ( Fig . 3B ) . WAVE2 − / − mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) transfected with wild - type WAVE2 and the PH domain of Akt ( AktPH ) formed broad lamel - lipodial protrusions and they were co - translocated when cells were stimulated with platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) ( Fig . 3C , b ) . However , WAVE2 A5mut ( Fig . 3A ) was not recruited to AktPH - enriched polarized membrane , and only small lamellipodia were formed ( Fig . 3C , c ) . Furthermore , pre - treatment of these cells with wortmannin inhibited the recruitment of both AktPH and wild - type WAVE2 to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 3C , d ) . Thus , WAVE2 is thought to bind PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 generated at the leading edge . In contrast , the localization of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 monitored by the PH domain of PLC δ 1 ( δ 1PH ) was not well correlated with that of WAVE2 ( Fig . 3C , e ) . From these results , we conclude that RacDA and PDGF stimulus cause enrichment of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 at the leading edge 22 , 25 , resulting in recruitment of WAVE2 to the leading edge . We then analysed the effect of overexpressing full - length WAVE2 A5mut , which contains a mutated Basic1 region . Wild - type or mutant WAVE2 was co - expressed with RacDA in NIH3T3 cells using IRES2 - EGFP - WAVE2 constructs , in which GFP and non - tagged WAVE2 are expressed as separate proteins . The level of WAVE2 expression could be estimated from the intensity of the direct fluorescence of GFP . Expression of wild - type WAVE2 did not inhibit Rac - induced forma - tion of lamellipodia ( Fig . 4A ) . In contrast , expression of WAVE2 A5mut greatly reduced lamellipodium formation , suggesting that this mutant functions in a dominant - negative manner ( Fig . 4B ) . The per - centage of cells containing lamellipodia dropped to 30 . 7 ± 1 0 . 1 % when WAVE2 A5mut was expressed , compared with control cells ( 70 . 1 ± 9 . 9 % ) ( Fig . 4C ) . To confirm whether the defect in lamellipodium formation caused by WAVE2 A5mut expression was also observed when PI ( 3 ) K activity is suppressed , we used the PI ( 3 ) K inhibitors wortmannin ( 100 nM ) and LY294002 ( 25 µ M ; data not shown ) to prevent production of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . As expected , Rac - expressing cells were defective for lamellipodium formation in the presence of these inhibitors ( Fig . 4D ) . These results further support the fact that the WAVE2 – PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 interaction is necessary for Rac - induced lamellipodium formation . We recently reported that endothelial cells and MEFs from WAVE2 − / − mouse embryos had defects in formation of lamellipodia at the lead - ing edge , although accumulation of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 was observed at the area facing the chemoattractant . We also showed that the defect in lamellipodium formation was restored by ectopic expression of WAVE2 ( refs 14 and 16 ) . To clarify the importance of the Basic1 region in the formation of lamellipodia at the polarized leading edge , we transiently expressed wild - type WAVE2 and WAVE2 A5mut in WAVE2 − / − MEFs and exam - ined the importance of WAVE2 lipid - binding activity in lamel - lipodium formation . WAVE2 proteins were expressed separately with GFP using pIRES2 - EGFP constructs . Polarization of MEFs was stimu - lated with PDGF - coated beads , which generate a PDGF gradient 16 . Wild - type MEFs showed ruffling and extended the membrane towards the PDGF - coated beads ( Fig . 4E ; also see Supplementary Information , Movie 1a ) . WAVE2 − / − MEFs also showed ruffling and some lamellipo - dial protrusion , but these protrusions were branched and unstable , and eventually retracted ( Fig . 4E , b ; also see Supplementary Information , Movie 1b ) .

In contrast , expression of WAVE2 A5mut only partially restored lamellipodium formation , resulting in formation of tiny , branched lamellipodia at random locations ( Fig . 4E , d ; also see Supplementary Information , Movie 1d ) . From these results , we con - clude that expression of WAVE2 A5mut is not sufficient to allow cells to generate stable lamellipodia at the leading edge . In migrating cells , such as neutrophils and Dictyostelium , PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is concentrated at the leading edge of the plasma mem - brane through the polarizing actions of PI ( 3 ) K and PTEN , a phospho - inositide 3 - phosphatase 26 – 28 . It has been reported that there is a positive feedback loop between PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and Rac GTPase , resulting in enhanced formation of membrane protrusions at the leading edge 22 . In the present study , the activation of PI ( 3 ) K ( and presumably the subse - quent production of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) at the plasma membrane is suffi - cient to recruit some populations of WAVE2 . We also generated WAVE2 A5mut , which lacks phosphoinositide - binding capability . Importantly , this mutant retained proper actin polymerization activity in response to activated Rac in actin polymerization experiments with cell lysates ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S1c ) . However , expression of WAVE2 A5mut reduced lamellipodium formation , the phenotype of which was identical to that induced by wortmannin . This evidence strongly suggests that the WAVE2 localizes at the leading edge through association with PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , which is generated both downstream and upstream of Rac after growth factor stimulation . Together , these results provide a link between PI ( 3 ) K and WAVE2 , by identifying an interaction between the amino - terminal WHD and basic region of WAVE2 , and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . This interaction may be analogous to that of N - WASP , which also binds with PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S1d ) . Therefore , it seems that PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is important for localization of WAVE2 ( and other proteins ) to the leading edge . Although PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 itself is sufficient for the translocation of WAVE2 to the cell periphery , several other mechanisms of WAVE2 reg - ulation also seem to function . Activated Rac is shown to contribute to WAVE2 localization at the leading edge , and presumably to the activa - tion of WAVE2 . We previously reported that activated Rac binds to IRSp53 , and in turn recruits or activates WAVE2 at the site of Rac acti - vation 12 . WAVE1 is reported to form a huge protein complex that includes PIR121 / Sra1 , Nap1 and Abi1 / 2 ( ref . 29 ) . In this complex , PIR121 / Sra1 is known to bind to activated Rac , and this binding is sug - gested to activate WAVE1 by modifying protein complex formation . These proteins are also shown to form a complex with WAVE2 . Recently , it was reported that disruption of these components by RNA interference ( RNAi ) caused impairment of localization and a decrease in the amount of WAVE2 , suggesting that these proteins are involved in A B C E D W il d t y p e G F P / W A VE 2 A 5 m u t G F P / W A VE 2 Actin GFP RacDA Merge Actin GFP RacDA Merge Actin RacDA Merge + w o r t m a nn i n 100 n M 80 60 40 30 0 C e ll s w i t h l a m e lli p o d i a ( % ) + / + − / − − / − − / − G F P a l o n e G F P a l o n e G F P / W A VE 2 w il d t y p e G F P / W A VE 2 A 5 m u t GFP GFP GFP GFP GFP alone GFP / A5mut a b c d Figure 4 Expression of the full - length WAVE2 mutant lacking phosphoinositide - binding activity inhibits proper formation of lamellipodia .

Thus , the coordination of these molecules , including PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , seems to be essential for WAVE2 - induced lamellipodium formation . Note added in proof : After this paper was accepted , Abi1 - Nap1 - PIR121 was shown to form a complex with WAVE2 in vitro and to mediate Rac - mediated membrane ruffle formation ( Nature Cell Biology , Published online : 28 March 2004 | doi : 10 . 1038 / ncb1105 ) . METHODS Reagents and antibodies . Phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) , phosphatidyl - choline ( PC ) , PtdIns , wortmannin and latrunculin B were purchased from Sigma ( St Louis , MO ) , and all phosphoinositides were from Cell Signals ( Columbus , OH ) . The following antibodies were used : rabbit anti - PI ( 3 ) K p85 anti serum ( Upstate , Lake Placid , NY ) ; rabbit anti - PI ( 3 ) K p110 α antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) ; mouse anti - Rac monoclonal anti - body ( a gift from Dr Azuma , Keio University Medical School ) ; rabbit anti - Myc ( A - 14 ) and mouse anti - Myc ( 9E10 ) monoclonal antibodies ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) ; mouse anti - Flag monoclonal antibody ( Sigma ) ; and rabbit anti - glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . Constructs . All WAVE2 fragments and mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) with human WAVE2 cDNA as template , and confirmed by sequencing . Site - specific mutagenesis was performed by PCR with mutated primers . To produce truncated WAVE2 proteins tagged with GST , they were cloned into pGEX 4T - 1 ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , Uppsala , Sweden ) . Full - length WAVE2 proteins were obtained by cloning cDNAs into pFASTBAC . To generate GFP fusion proteins , cDNAs encoding full - length and N - terminal region ( residues 1 – 183 ) of WAVE2 were cloned into pEGFP N - 3 and N - 2 ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) , respectively . For expression of non - tagged full - length WAVE2 proteins in cells , the cDNAs encoding the full - length WAVE2 ( wild type and A5mut ) were cloned into pIRES2 - EGFP ( Clontech ) . Expression of WAVE2 proteins was confirmed as the direct fluorescence of separately expressed GFP . Cell culture and transfection . NIH3T3 cells and MEFs ( wild type and WAVE2 − / − ) ( ref . 16 ) were cultured in DMEM containing 10 % calf serum and 10 % fetal bovine serum , respectively , and penicillin / streptomycin at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 . For transient expression , cells were transfected by the calcium phos - phate method or with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) accord - ing to the manufacturer’s protocol . To prevent PI ( 3 ) K activity , cells were treated with 100 nM wortmannin and 25 µ M LY294002 for 30 min before fixation . Immunofluorescence microscopy . Cells cultured on coverslips were fixed in 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in PBS . Cells were permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 5 min and then incubated with primary antibodies for 60 min . Cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with secondary antibodies and rhodamine – phalloidin ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) for 30 min . Cells were then washed with PBS and mounted on glass slides . Immunostained cells were observed with a Radiance 2000 confocal laser - scanning microscope ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) . Protein expression and purification . GST - tagged WAVE2 truncated proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified with glutathione – sepharose beads ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) according to a standard method . His - and GST - tagged full - length WAVE2 proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified on glutathione – sepharose beads by standard methods . ELISA assay for lipid - binding . Lipid vesicles ( PE / PC = 1 / 1 , total 2 µ g ) contain - ing 10 % ( by mass ) phospholipids re - suspended in 100 % ethanol were coated on 96 - well plates ( Immulon2 HB ; Thermo Labsystems , Franklin , MA ) and air dried at room temperature . Wells were then blocked with 5 % BSA in PBS before incubation with the appropriate GST fusion protein ( 1 . 0 µ g ml − 1 ) for 45 min . Wells were washed with 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 in PBS , and glutathione - conjugated peroxidase ( 1 . 0 µ g ml − 1 , Sigma ) was overlaid and detected by reaction with orthophenylene diamine . The absorbance was measured at 492 nm with an ELISA plate reader ( Bio - Rad ) . Co - sedimentation assay . Synthetic liposomes contained 48 % PC , 48 % PtdIns , and 4 % of the test lipid ( mol % ) . Liposomes were re - suspended at a concentra - tion of 1 mM test lipid in 100 mM Hepes at pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM NaCl , 5 mM EGTA and 50 mM sucrose , and subjected to five cycles of freezing ( liquid N 2 ) and thawing ( water bath at 37 °C ) followed by extrusion through a 0 . 1 - µ m cyclo - pore filter . Ten micrograms of the protein and liposomes were mixed in 10 mM Hepes at pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithiothre - itol , 0 . 2 mM ATP and 0 . 1 % Tween 20 , and rotated at 4 °C for 90 min . After cen - trifuging at 25 , 000 g for 20 min , the vesicle pellet was suspended in SDS sample buffer and bound protein was identified by western blotting . Concentrations of liposomes were calculated by dividing the total concentration by two , because 50 % of the total was assumed to be on the inside layer of the vesicles . Dual polarization interferometer . Interactions between GST - tagged proteins and phospholipids were investigated with AnaLight Bio200 ( Farfield Sensors , Manchester , UK ) . The phospholipid vesicles used in these experiments con - tained PC / PtdIns / PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 or PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 at 48 : 48 : 4 ( mol ) and were prepared by extrusion through a 0 . 1 - µ m cyclopore filter . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 vesicles were coated on the surface of different channels of a C - 18 sensor chip according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The lipids were bound in a monolayer onto C - 18 tips , forming the lipid bilayer - like structure with C - 18 carbon chains and lipids . The buffer consisted of 10 mM Hepes at pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl and 3 mM EDTA . GST - tagged proteins were injected at dif - ferent concentrations in the same buffer ( association phase ) . The sensor chip was regenerated by injection of 10 mM NaOH . Bindings were examined at four or more different protein concentrations , and then K D , k ass , and k diss values were calculated from curve fitting over the initial 60 s of association . Visualization of WAVE2 translocations in WAVE2 − / − MEFs . Serum - starved MEFs were stimulated with 20 ng ml − 1 PDGF ( Invitrogen ) . Cells were observed by a TSC - SP2 confocal laser - scanning microscope ( Leica Microsystems , Wetzler , Germany ) . To prevent PI ( 3 ) K activity , cells were treated with 100 nM wortmannin for 30 min before stimulation . Time - lapse observation of morphological changes of WAVE2 − / − MEFs . Heparin beads ( Sigma ) were incubated with 50 µ g ml − 1 of PDGF at room tem - perature for 2 h ( ref . 16 ) . The beads were washed with PBS and applied to serum - starved MEFs . Cells were observed immediately after placement of beads under a microscope at intervals of 10 s . Sequential images were stored as a 0 . 1 s per frame movie file ( × 100 speed ) . PI ( 3 ) K activity assay . Vector or RacDA was transiently expressed in NIH3T3 cells , and serum - starved cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 0 . 2 M NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 10 % glycerol , 1 % NP - 40 , 1mM PMSF and 1 mM sodium ortho vanadate ) . For measurement of PI ( 3 ) K activity , immunoprecipitates with anti - p85 from the lysates were washed three times with wash buffer 1 ( 1 % NP - 40 in PBS , 1 mM PMSF , 1 mM sodium ortho vanadate ) , three times with wash buffer 2 ( 100 mM Tris - HCl at pH 7 . 5 , 500 mM LiCl , 1 mM sodium ortho vanadate ) , and twice with wash buffer 3 ( 10 mM Tris - HCl at pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM sodium ortho vana - date ) , and then resuspended in 70 µ l of PI mix ( 0 . 3 mg ml - 1 PI , 1 mM EGTA , 100 mM MgCl 2 , and wash buffer 3 ) . The PI ( 3 ) K reaction was initiated by addi - tion of 5 µ l ATP mix ( 20 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 88 mM ATP , 5 µ Ci γ - 32 P - ATP ) and allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 10 min . Extracted phospholipids were resolved by thin - layer chromatography and developed in chloroform / meth - anol / water / 25 % ammonia ( 60 / 47 / 5 . 6 / 8 , by volume ) . Radioactive products were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by liquid scintillation counting . Note : Supplementary Information is available on the Nature Cell Biology website .
