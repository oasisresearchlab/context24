Or have you been frustrated because your child is sniffling from the cold air blasting from the AC , but could not do anything ? Do you remember a time when the supposedly pleasant music playing in a restaurant came to your ear as a disturbance ? You may have thought you were the only one who felt that way , and hence should endure the inconvenience . In reality , everyone could be suffering and no one could act to change the situation . The situation could from time to time incur conflict and partitioning of people . “Too hot ! Turn on the AC ! ” “Too cold ! Turn it off ! ” A severe conflict over the AC is not unusual in a high school classroom . Sharing a public space 1 is the basis of a modern urban life . The mode and culture of sharing could be an indicator of the quality of life in the cities [ 36 ] . The buses and restaurants should comfort and bring satisfaction to possibly every person in them . Furthermore , they should look after the vulnerable and give favor to them upon their special needs . However , its operation mostly occurs in rather a closed and exclusive manner [ 95 ] . Could the sharing of the public space be operated in a democratic way ? An inherent limitation to inclusive sharing of a public space lies in the exclusive modes of actuator activation and control interfaces . Traditional forms of the interfaces are typically structured as but - tons , dials , and panels with on - off , up - down , or sliding interactions . These structures can reflect only the actions of the person who attains the access permits , and come short of flexibly incorporating the various needs of a number of people . Therefore , while the space itself is shared , the actuators comprising the operational details of the space , called public actuators hereafter , are controlled in exclu - sive ways . IoT - enabled actuators allow remote controls through a mobile app , but such controls are still exclusively granted to the owner of the actuator via authentication or physical pairing , etc . Even with IoT - enabled actuators , the philosophy of one - on - one 1 Here , we use a broader meaning of public space – places generally accessible to members of the public , such as cafés , trains , shops , and movie theaters [ 96 ] . 467 MobiSys ’21 , June 24 – July 2 , 2021 , Virtual , WI , USA Wonjung Kim et al . control stays the same and there is no notion of social , collective control by the public . It is important to seek a new way to open and democratize the modes of activation and control of the actuators . To this end , we explore the potential of social control and use of IoT devices ( See Fig . 1 ) . We note that it is an underexplored new direction of research even with its huge potential and implication , but comes with high complexity and scale . We provide initial results in two facets . We first present a novel architecture , namely , Social Control - and - Use Architecture for IoT Devices . It provides a systematic view and insight toward the otherwise highly complex problem of large scale . We also present Hivemind , a first - of - a - kind system developed , upon the architecture , for the sharing of IoT - enabled actuators in a public space . Developing a system for social control and use is a complex problem . It spans three already complex entities , i . e . , users , devices , and spaces . It should consider the heterogeneity of the entities and their potential intricate interactions . A public space further compounds the situation . It inherently bears uncertainties : visitors freely enter and exit different spaces at any time at their own will . It is unpredictable who the visitors are and when they visit . They are strangers to each other . Similarly , they confront actuator devices in an unexpected way , i . e . , it is not certain if and what they will meet in the space . It is unclear who is eligible to engage in the control . Synchronous interactions among the visitors are almost infeasible . This complexity and uncertainty would preclude the adoption of simple and common strategies for system design . The proposed Social Control - and - Use Architecture aims at pro - viding a ground upon which efforts for challenging system design could be performed and elaborated . It is developed as a 5 - layered architecture after rounds of thoughtful and exploratory applications of the principle of separation of concerns ; the separation of delicate human social interactions from intricate device connectivity ; the separation of awareness of social contexts and formulation of pref - erences from legitimate consensus - building process ; the separation of authorized participants from potential ones , etc . With unraveling of the source of complexity , five core components are identified composing the layered architecture ( § 3 ) . This initial architecture would guide respective designers to look into the complication and intricacy in their own problems and reach an effective system design . Hivemind is a novel system which transforms an exclusively - controlled actuator in a public space into a true public actuator . Designed as a specific articulation of the 5 - layered architecture towards the high uncertainties of the public space , it allows vis - itors to instantly participate in the democratic collective control of the actuator . Also , a myriad of off - the - shelf actuators are easily incorporated without modification to their implementation . The system is composed of three main physical components ; a mobile app on visitors’ smartphones , a control server located in the cloud or on - site , and public actuators installed in the public space . We discuss the key features of the Hivemind system . First , we present the new concept of influence - aware authorization ( § 7 ) – the participants are dynamically granted the votership upon ap - proaching an area of influence ( AoI ) , i . e . , the spatial area under the physical influence of the actuator’s operation ( e . g . , sound from a public speaker ) . Second , Hivemind leverages utility - based preference aggregation ( § 6 ) to flexibly abstract and incorporate diverse aggre - gation and consensus - building policies , reflecting different social and spatial contexts . Third , Hivemind further enables asynchronous and continual decision - making , ensuring fair and efficient use of the actuators ; the participants express their preferences at their own moments of their own will , which continuously updates the current decision . Forth , Hivemind covers the heterogeneity of the actuators and their native control APIs using a common abstrac - tion of the control operations ( § 5 ) . Upon consensus on the control , Hivemind automatically generates an actual control command com - plying with the vendor - specific native APIs . Hivemind provides participants with a social control interface , which helps them easily derive and express their preferences in the context of social control and consensus building beyond one - to - one exclusive control . We deployed a Hivemind prototype to five real - world public spaces for a month , offering democratic controls on five different types of actuators openly available . Experimental results highlight the comprehensive service coverage as well as users’ approval on the democratic collective control of public actuators . The key contributions of the paper are as follows : • We bring the problem of social control - and - use of IoT devices to the agenda of mobile - IoT computing research , and propose the initial architecture . • We build Hivemind , which realizes fair and efficient democratic control - and - use among the public crowd , integrating multiple technologies including IoT interoperability , preference aggrega - tion , and AoI detection into a single coherent system . • We conduct a one - month - long field deployment over real - world public spaces and demonstrate user acceptance , satisfaction , us - ability , and service coverage over heterogeneous actuators . 2 MOTIVATION Many public spaces , e . g . , buses , waiting rooms , pubs , cafés , libraries , have actuators installed to promote the comfort and accommodate the interests of visitors . To fulfill the purposes , it is needed to ensure the actuators’ operation aligns with the visitors’ preferences . However , there is surprisingly little practice that directly reflects the preferences of on - site , real - time visitors . Below , we analyze the hurdles and limitations , followed by potential opportunities . 2 . 1 Hurdles and Limitations Absence of proper multi - user interfaces . Many actuators in public spaces such as ACs , lighting fixtures , speakers , and TVs are either a regular consumer appliance or a commercial - grade model . Still , they mostly come with a single built - in input panel or a single remote control , presuming a single user’s control at a time . The remote is often unavailable – either lost or purposely kept by the space administrator to make exclusive decisions . Psychological or cultural bar . Think of a scenario where a stu - dent lounge is occupied by a dozen students . One feels chilly and wants to turn off the AC . But she has to directly request the admin to change the settings . Even at places where students are allowed to access the control of the AC , she should speak up about her preference and ask for other occupants’ agreement . She hesitates for a minute whether to speak up or not , but ends up doing nothing . 468 Hivemind : Social Control - and - Use of IoT towards Democratization of Public Spaces MobiSys ’21 , June 24 – July 2 , 2021 , Virtual , WI , USA According to sociology and psychology literature , a number of mental hurdles are in the way before a potential requester decides whether to speak up or not . The requester undergoes a compli - cated psychological process to estimate how likely others would agree [ 103 ] , and often feels disturbed by imagining the possible de - nial and resulting awkwardness [ 29 , 39 ] . Similar complications are posed to the other occupants as well ; by denying such a request , they seem to feel violating the implicit norm of benevolence [ 40 , 43 , 84 ] . Considering such risks and burdens going in both ways , the re - quester often rather chooses not to act at all and just endure the uncomfortable temperature [ 76 ] . Cultural variations of such norms make the problem even more complicated [ 103 ] . Contract issues or owner’s discretion . In some cases , public actuators are at a fixed setting as per a paid contract . In a space open to public but privately owned , some actuators may stay with a configuration as per the owner’s policy , e . g . , a speaker in an art gallery playing a playlist curated by the owner to pair with the art pieces . Since these actuators are not purposed to accommodate the visitors’ preferences , these are not the case that Hivemind targets . 2 . 2 Current Workarounds Despite the difficulties , we observe that visitors do have the desire to change environment settings of the public space they occupy . Surveys report divided preferences on the office room tempera - ture [ 42 ] . Also , visitors actively leave comments on Yelp about their environmental preferences at a place , such that the music is too loud or the lighting is too dim [ 13 ] . Expressing their desire through such apps would help alleviate the aforementioned psychological hurdles aggravated in face - to - face communications [ 8 , 68 , 117 ] . However , the shortcomings of today’s practices are obvious . ( 1 ) Retrospective reviews are not immediately actionable at the time of discomfort . ( 2 ) At a given place , finding the right online discussion forum , e . g , Yelp page or Twitter handle , is not straightforward for the visitors . ( 3 ) Such forums do not regard a user’s real - time on - site presence . A last week’s visitor can tweet that the AC should be set cooler , while a majority of visitors at this moment are feeling chilly . ( 4 ) Albeit lengthy threads of the visitors’ posts , those online platforms do not necessarily help them converge into a single de - cision point , e . g . , a most satisfying temperature . ( 5 ) Even with an agreed new setting , applying this setting on the actuator still needs someone to access the traditional interface or request to the admin . These hurdles and workarounds motivate us to design a new platform for hassle - free , place - specific , collective decision - making and seamless control on a nearby public actuator’s operation . 3 ARCHITECTURE FOR SOCIAL CONTROL - AND - USE OF IoT DEVICES IoT brings a new horizon in the way of controlling and using oth - erwise ‘isolated’ devices . Importantly , it opens up the potential of social control - and - use of the devices , overcoming the traditional , long - standing perception of exclusive control as well as the result - ing limitation in the existing interface design . However , most of the discussion around IoT technologies has been centered on providing and utilizing connectivity over distance [ 3 , 60 , 82 , 87 ] and automat - ing related processes [ 3 , 26 , 71 , 107 , 108 ] . Exploiting them in the view of social control - and - use is rather an underexplored area even with its huge potential and implication , awaiting attention from research communities . We below present the three core entities involved in the social control - and - use of an IoT device , i . e . , device , space , and participants . Each entails a high degree of diversity and heterogeneity [ 7 , 35 ] ; and when put together , they further exacerbate the situation . The contexts encompassing the social control - and - use in a space become complex and dynamic . An architectural ground would be sought after to provide a systematic view and an effective tool to handle the complexity and intricacy . We present an initial architecture of social control - and - use of IoT devices ( Fig . 2 ) . We further elaborate the architecture for ‘ instanta - neous social control - and - use in a public space ’ as an important class . We present the design of the Hivemind system as a realization of the architecture in § 4 . • Device : An architecture is to be crafted and incorporate the ever - increasing diversity and heterogeneity of IoT devices . They could have different types of control interfaces such as on - off , slider , mode selection , and keypad input , etc . Also , they could allow remote or timer - triggered control . Moreover , the devices from different vendors could have vendor - specific APIs [ 17 , 67 ] . An architecture would also need to consider different spatial implications as per their AoI ( See § 7 ) . Some devices ( e . g . , heaters , ACs , and air purifiers ) are designed to influence their ambient environment uniformly while others ( e . g . , public displays , speakers , and lighting fixtures ) could show directionality in their influences or decay over distance . • Space : A number of different aspects of a space would affect the way it operates its installed devices . The types and purposes of the space ( e . g . , hospital , school bus , air flight , park , restaurant , etc ) would have different implications . Other aspects ( e . g . , public or pri - vate , open or closed , different sizes , and presence of administrative staff ) should also be considered [ 37 , 96 ] . • Participants : The participants would be a diverse group of people . They have different personalities , ages , health conditions , physical capabilities , and cultural backgrounds , leading to have different attitudes and preferences in the way they control and use a device . This makes the social control - and - use of IoT devices extremely complex and delicate . There are a number of different aspects to consider ; eligibility of participants , one - time vs . frequent users ( or visitors ) of the device ( or space ) , relationship among participants ( strangers or acquain - tances ) , physical locations ( in the same space or distant to each other or the device ) . 3 . 1 5 - layered Architecture Fig . 2 illustrates a high - level overview of the architecture , in the context of dynamic interactions among devices , spaces , and partici - pants . It is developed with rounds of applications of the principle of separation of concerns ; in the high level , the complications and concerns on the participants are separated from those on the de - vices . It would be desirable that participants’ interactions with the devices are exclusively managed by virtually designated agents . In addition , the issues on real human actions ( with the devices or other participants ) and those on the processes of social decision ( or consensus ) are separated into different layers ( Social Control Inter - action Layer and Aggregation and Consensus Layer , respectively ) . 469 MobiSys ’21 , June 24 – July 2 , 2021 , Virtual , WI , USA Wonjung Kim et al .

L3 provides the authorized ones with a social con - trol interface to express preferences . L4 provides mechanisms to collect the preferences and mediate them to lead to consensus . The derived consensus is delivered to L5 , which brings it into effect . The former provides the scope of participants’ understanding on the social contexts in the space as well as their radius of actions . As such , it would directly influence the acceptability of a system . The latter is significant as it affects the participants’ trust and willing - ness toward agreements on the social control and use . It would be preferable that this layer provides a frame to incorporate diverse alternative policies to be selectively used in different situations . The separation of participants and their eligibility management as a layer is important as they are the main sources of complication with their diversity and fluidity ( e . g . , mobility ) ; this layer would potentially reduce the complexity in the operation of the whole system at its early stage . • Device Connectivity Layer : This layer is to provide devices with Internet connectivity , thereby putting them into the picture of social control - and - use . The existing IoT infrastructure [ 3 , 125 ] would serve as the basic substrate . However , it would also be an issue if and how to increase the coverage for other legacy or smart devices without such connectivity . • Participant Discovery and Authorization Layer : This layer identifies the potential participants and authorizes them if they are eligible for the social control - and - use of a device . It will identify who appears or disappears in the space ; for each person present , it will start the handshaking and go through the authorization process , and provide a feedback for the result . The layer should consider diverse policies and mechanisms for the discovery and authorization . There is a broad spectrum of poli - cies and eligibility criteria , and a proper selection would require consideration on the details of the three entities – devices , spaces , and participants . The criteria may take into account visitor’s physi - cal presence , influence of a device , or membership ( e . g . , the votership given only to ticketed passengers in a train station ) . Delegation of votership could be considered ( e . g . , parents at work participating in the AC control of a kindergarten bus ) . Also , different mechanisms are to be considered , such as visitor profile - , registration - , a visitor’s location sensing - , and / or a device’s influence sensing - based ones , etc [ 45 , 48 ] . An additional issue is protection from security and privacy threats , e . g . , fake participants or anti - social behaviors [ 46 ] . • Social Control Interaction Layer : This layer is to support the so - cial interactions among participants , assisting them to express their intentions and opinions , i . e . , preferences , and facilitating their collec - tive decision - making . A carefully designed social control interface would help participants easily derive and specify their preferences , in the context of social control beyond one - to - one exclusive con - trol . The layer generates such an interface and delivers it to the legitimate participants as authorized by Participant Discovery and Authorization Layer . In a larger view , the layer , in connection with Aggregation and Consensus Layer , should help the participants lead to a consensus in an efficient and acceptable manner [ 58 , 78 ] . It would also maintain the list of currently authorized participants for each device . The layer should consider participants’ burden to engage in the interactions with different devices and their interfaces ; e . g . , one could be frustrated even upon a commonly used device but with an unfamiliar interface . The burden would be amplified in a newly visited space . Moreover , it could be subtle and tedious to articulate preferences on the social control ; it comes upon partic - ipants’ awareness of the delicate social contexts in the space as well as the progress of on - going consensus building . A number of issues are to be considered : consistent interfaces across different devices and spaces , instant and automatic deployment of the in - terfaces , visualization of preference distributions ( i . e . , the summary on others’ preferences ) , channels for feedback , preference elicitation , etc [ 21 , 33 , 88 ] . • Aggregation and Consensus Layer : This layer provides policies and mechanisms to collect from multiple participants their pref - erences , using the social interface support from Social Interaction Layer , and mediate them to lead to a consensus across different preferences . This is oftentimes a complicated and obscure process , asking for iterative or continual refinements with a persuasive feedback beyond a single - pass process [ 77 ] . To be included is a mechanism to incorporate and enforce space - specific social rules ( § 6 ) . Additionally , other features such as anti - social behavior prevention would be considered in this layer . • Device Control Layer : This layer brings into effect the social control of a device according to the consensus derived from the multiple participants through the aggregation and consensus layer . A basic issue is to provide mechanisms to select and invoke proper device control APIs ; however , challenges come with the diversity of devices and their APIs . A naïve ( e . g . , device - or space - specific ) approach would limit the coverage and adoption of the system . Therefore , it would be crucial to devise an abstraction to hide the diversity and heterogeneity [ 17 ] , and provide an automated tool to generate the control enforcement mechanisms upon the abstraction , preferably in a programming - free fashion . 4 HIVEMIND DESIGN Following the motivation ( § 2 ) and the architecture ( § 3 ) , we propose Hivemind , a novel system for social and democratic control - and - use of actuators in a public space ; i . e . , triggering them to operate in the manner determined by the public . Realizing such a system is immensely complicated . With open access to the space , uncer - tainties are inevitable ; the space becomes an indeterminate object of which the contexts are dynamic and unpredictable . It is difficult 470 Hivemind : Social Control - and - Use of IoT towards Democratization of Public Spaces MobiSys ’21 , June 24 – July 2 , 2021 , Virtual , WI , USA LAYERS ParticipantDiscovery & Authorization Social Control Interaction Aggregation & Consensus Device Control Device Connectivity Actuators Control Server ➋ Influence - aware Authorizer ➌ Entity Manager Device schema Participants & preferences ➏ Preference Aggregation Engine ➎ Social Control UI Voting Preference distribution Chat … ➍ Schema - based Control UI Generator Schema - UI templates ➐ Device Control Command Generator Participant Device ( Mobile App ) Notification of eligibility Admin Tool Policy authoring tool Registered actuators DB Authorizationrequest Authorized user entries Consensus Actuator state Preference ( vote ) ➊ Device Discoverer Mic . … Control command for ‘ set _ state ’ ( device API ) BLE Space info , Actuator info , Preferencedistribution , … P o li c i e s and s c h e m a s … 5 4 1 2 3 6 7 Figure 3 : System architecture of Hivemind for the system to adopt common strategies useful for its design , leading to unique design requirements and goals . 4 . 1 Key Design Goals of Hivemind • Comprehensive coverage of actuators . Hivemind should be able to incorporate a myriad of off - the - shelf actuators , which could be deployed in public spaces . It should provide a single uniform “polling station” through which visitors easily vote for their prefer - ences on the operations of all participating actuators . • Asynchronous and continual decision - making . It is unlikely that all the visitors in a space express their preferences at the same time . There are continuous inflow and outflow of visitors , and a visitor’s preference may change during her stay . Hivemind should accommodate new votes from a visitor at any time , continuously updating the current decision accordingly . • Transparency of decision - making . A virtue in decision - making is that the participants transparently understand the process and its outcome , albeit the difference from their own votes . • Instant participation . People visit different public spaces . They freely move in and out on a short - term basis . It is imperative to support them to instantaneously and easily participate in Hivemind . • AoI - aware dynamic grant of votership . Given an actuator , it is intuitive to entitle a visitor to vote if she is under the influence of that actuator , e . g . , if she is in the region around an IoT speaker in which the visitors are conscious of the music being played . In this light , Hivemind should be designed in a way that a visitor is authorized to vote by doing nothing but simply entering the area of influence . In the meantime , Hivemind should keep the votership from those who are not present in the space but attempting to manipulate the actuator’s operation . • Programming - free instantiation . Hivemind should be instan - tiated in a programming - free manner . Given the huge number of public spaces and their associated actuators , it is not practical to as - sume that each actuator in operation could go through modification to its implementation . The space admins , usually responsible for the devices in the spaces , are not necessarily programming experts . 4 . 2 Use case of Hivemind Patrick , a businessman commuting by bus every day , enters the bus with five strangers . Similar to the case of the student lounge ( § 2 . 1 ) , he and perhaps other passengers feel the temperature of the bus is too low . The Hivemind app just then notifies Patrick that he can participate in the control of the AC . Patrick launches the Hivemind app and is presented with the Social Control UI . It shows the current temperature , 23 ◦ C , and allows him to select his preference on the AC temperature . His choice , 26 ◦ C , is collected by the Hivemind server immediately . The Preference Aggregation Engine of Hivemind aggregates the preferences from all participating passengers and evaluates the new setting , 25 ◦ C , which would make the passengers more satisfied overall . This new setting is automatically applied to the AC by the Hivemind server via the AC’s native APIs . Also , Patrick sees the distribution of other passengers’ preferred temper - ature values on the app , which are still different from his own , but readily agreeing to the new decision . 4 . 3 Overview of the Hivemind System Design Fig . 3 shows the Hivemind system architecture comprising three physical components ; a mobile app , a control server , and public actuators . It can also include auxiliary devices for discovery and authorization . Hivemind is designed as an articulation of the 5 - layered architecture as a reference towards meeting the design goals above . 5 - layered architecture being in action for a public space Hivemind’s participant discovery and authorization layer adopts in - stant participation andAoI - based authorization policies . The system provides both physical influence - sensing - based and location - based mechanisms for the AoI estimation . ( See § 7 for details . ) Also , the authorization process is interaction - free , not requiring any explicit interactions from the participant side . The instant participation is materialized through an app shared across different spaces and devices . It requires only one - time registration to the system ; upon entrance to a space or confrontation to a Hivemind - instantiated ac - tuator , the users are automatically notified of the potential eligibility for participation in the actuator control . The layer is composed of two main components : Device Detector , sitting in the Hivemind app , and Influence - aware Authorizer , in the Hivemind Control Server . The social control interaction layer of Hivemind provides partici - pants with social control interfaces using a schema - based approach . Hivemind composes the layer with a unified voting interface , visu - alization on the preference distribution , and a chatting UI . It further shows the applied aggregation policy , e . g . , majority rule . These facil - ities altogether grant transparency in the decision - making , and give a consistent view over the heterogeneity in the native interfaces . The layer has three major components , namely , Schema - based Control UI Generator , Entity Manager , and Social Control UI . The generator automatically composes and instantly delivers the Social Control UI to each participant as soon as they are authorized . It additionally provides State Descriptor , which gives a summary of the actuator states to help the participants decide their preferences . The schema is taken from Registered Actuators DB , which stores actuator - specific information . As for the aggregation and consensus layer , Hivemind currently adopts a utility - based approach , i . e . , optimizing the total utilities of participants . The utility is derived by the policy as configured by the space admin . It further adopts asynchronous voting and iterative continual refinements of their preferences as stated in § 4 . 1 , 471 MobiSys ’21 , June 24 – July 2 , 2021 , Virtual , WI , USA Wonjung Kim et al . to facilitate the aggregation process . The layer includes two major components : Preference Aggregation Engine and Policy Authoring Tool . See § 6 and § 8 . 3 for details . The device control layer of Hivemind includes Device Control Command Generator , which generates the command to invoke the device - specific native device API and update the device states . It exploits the existing open - source service , openHAB ( See § 5 ) . For extended coverage , Hivemind further incorporates other , i . e . , non - IoT - enabled devices in collaboration with an external gateway . ( § 5 and § 8 . 2 ) Hivemind System Setup : The instantiation is of the space admin’s task ; the admin simply specifies in a high level a set of configuration parameters , reflecting the operational requirements of the actuator and the space . Hivemind provides a tool to effectively hide and select details of different actuators , and support the admin to specify their requirements as needed . As such , the admin can easily transform existing actuators into Hivemind - enabled actuators . The admin starts with Admin Console to choose an actuator and its functionalities to open , e . g . , a specific AC and its temperature range , and proceeds to Policy Authoring Tool for the authorization and aggregation policies ( Fig . 7 ) . On the site , the admin may need to install auxiliary devices , e . g . , a BLE beacon and a gateway ( § 8 ) . Handshaking : A visitor happens to approach an actuator . Her Hivemind app , running Device Discoverer in the background , detects a nearby beacon , indicating she may be in the actuator’s AoI . The app initiates the authorization process , which calls Influence - aware Authorizer . The system continues as the numbering in Fig . 3 . 5 SUPPORTING HETEROGENEOUS IoT ACTUATORS To cope with heterogeneous devices , it is compelling to provide a unified abstraction of the devices . In addition , it is also imper - ative to provide a separation between the actual enforcement of device control and other issues of the social control - and - use , e . g . , authorization , social interaction , and aggregation . It is upon this separation that diverse policies and mechanisms could be invented and experimented . The experiments could be performed free from the technical or implementation details of the individual devices . For the abstraction and separation , Hivemind leverages the growing home automation systems [ 4 , 27 , 99 ] recently developed by open - source communities . The device control can be enforced in a high level without looking into the details of the vendor - specific native APIs and writing a control code . Consider an AC device from a specific vendor and the space admin defines AC _ TEMP as its control variable . The schema for the control variable could be retrieved in the form , e . g . , < name = “AC _ TEMP” , type = Number , attributes = { min : 18 , max : 26 } > . Upon the consensus of setting the AC _ TEMP to 23 , the con - trol enforcement can be represented as , e . g . , < set , " AC _ TEMP " , 23 > . The admin could further use the schema to compose an aggregation policy and configure a social control interface ( e . g . , slider for the type Number ) . To support actuators with legacy interfaces , e . g . , IR signal - or mechanical action - based interfaces , Hivemind utilizes IoT - enabled bridge devices which imitate those signals or actions for the control . For example , universal IR remotes [ 15 ] emulate a remote controller by transmitting the same pattern of IR signals to the legacy actuator . Likewise , smart plugs [ 65 ] mimic the physical power switch of the connected actuator . Hivemind currently supports 100 + heterogeneous IoT actuators . From our inspection , almost all commercial actuators with open API , taken from Amazon site , are covered by two major home au - tomation systems , OpenHAB [ 99 ] and Home Assistant [ 4 ] . We can easily extend Hivemind to include other home automation systems , and further adopt techniques like Lumos [ 67 ] or EPIDOSITE [ 86 ] to support devices without open API . 6 PREFERENCE AGGREGATION Decision - making in Hivemind follows the aggregation policy con - figured by the space admin . Hivemind provides a policy authoring tool where the admin encodes the social rules appropriate to the space . Our aim is to support the encoding of fairness and efficiency together , the two primary factors in resource sharing . 6 . 1 Utility Function To quantify the satisfaction of a user , Hivemind leverages utility function . It takes the user preference on the actuator’s state as input and returns a quantified satisfaction between 0 ( “unhappy” ) and 1 ( “happy” ) . It models user satisfaction without requiring the manual annotation of all possible options . Following the scales of measurement [ 116 ] , we suggest two types of utility functions for the two different scales of actuator variables : Nominal and Ordinal . Nominal : Actuator variables such as music playlists or TV channels have nominal scales . A corresponding utility function is given : 𝑈 ( 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑠 ) = (cid:26) 1 . 0 if 𝑠 ∈ 𝑝 𝑖 0 . 0 if 𝑠 ∉ 𝑝 𝑖 𝑈 : utility function 𝑝 𝑖 : selected options 𝑠 : state of an actuator ( 1 ) The utility is 1 if the actuator’s state 𝑠 is included in the selected options , and 0 otherwise . Ordinal : Actuator variables like wind power ( ordinal ) and temper - ature ( interval ) of the AC , or the amplitude ( ratio ) of a speaker have orders between options . In Hivemind , we model the user satisfac - tion based on the distance between the actuator state and the user preference , with the assumption that the satisfaction degrades if the distance increases . An admin may allow the selection of multiple preferences . With the assumption that all preference values have equal priority , the unary utility function can be intuitively extended to multivariate ; taking the maximum output of unary functions . 6 . 2 Aggregation Policy Hivemind provides three primitives for the aggregation policy : efficiency , fairness , and state precedence . Hivemind formulates an optimization problem of these primitives using the following terms . 6 . 2 . 1 Efficiency and fairness . Efficiency : Efficiency aims to maximize the total utility of users : 𝑠 𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡 = argmax 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆 (cid:34)∑︁ 𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 𝑈 ( 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑠 ) (cid:35) 𝐼 : set of participants 𝑠 𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡 : next actuator state 𝑆 : set of state variable options ( 2 ) 472 Hivemind : Social Control - and - Use of IoT towards Democratization of Public Spaces MobiSys ’21 , June 24 – July 2 , 2021 , Virtual , WI , USA Fairness : Max - min fairness is widely used to achieve fairness in resource sharing . We tweak the typical max - min schemes [ 128 ] that consider utility values at a point of time . However , the utility function for the nominal variable has a value of 0 or 1 , which precludes fair distribution of utility at a point of time . We tackle the problem by distributing utility over time , which effectively let users receive utility in turn : 𝑈 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣 = 𝜏 − 1 ∑︁ 𝑡 = 𝜏 − 𝜔 𝑈 ( 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑡 , 𝑠 𝑡 ) , 𝑈 𝑒𝑥𝑝 = 𝜏 + 𝛿 ( 𝑠 ) ∑︁ 𝑡 = 𝜏 𝑈 ( 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑡 , 𝑠 ) ( 3 ) 𝑈 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣 : estimated satisfaction of past , 𝑈 𝑒𝑥𝑝 : estimated satisfaction of future , 𝜏 : current time , 𝜔 : look - back size for time window , 𝛿 ( 𝑠 ) : expected duration the state 𝑠 holds in the future , 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑡 : selected option at time 𝑡 of participant 𝑖 , and 𝑠 𝑡 : actuator state at time 𝑡 . The time window considers both the recent past , 𝜔 , and the near future , 𝛿 ( 𝑠 ) . These parameters are configured by the space admin , considering the visit patterns of participants . Hivemind decides the next actuator state by utilizing the past and future estimated satisfaction as below . 𝑠 𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡 = argmax 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆 min 𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 [ 𝑈 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣 + 𝑈 𝑒𝑥𝑝 ] ( 4 ) 6 . 2 . 2 State precedence . While efficiency and fairness are effective in most cases , they sometimes do not operate in the desired manner . We consider the following two limitations . Oscillation problem : During a micro - deployment , we observed an oscillation of actuator states . An IoT speaker , which followed the fairness policy , kept swinging between two playlists every few seconds . It turned out that these playlists were selected by the two least satisfied visitors . This oscillation made the songs stop during their introduction . This significantly degraded user satisfaction . Space - specific restriction : Public spaces often have space - specific restrictions . The restrictions may include turning off the lights at night , limiting the AC temperature to save energy , and not playing the music too loud . They are managed by space admins or have already been a consensus between people . For example , consider lobby lights in a guesthouse . Guesthouse owners may want their guests to turn off the lobby lights during bedtime . This intention can be translated into a new restriction turning off the lobby lights un - less the guests are unanimous . These restrictions , however , cannot be applied to Hivemind only with the two primitives . To address the oscillation problem and support space - specific restrictions , Hivemind introduces state precedence . State precedence has two main functions . First , it grants a temporary high priority on the current state , thereby preventing the oscillation problem . For example , Hivemind can grant a higher priority to the current playlist than others until the first song is over . A space admin can adjust the expiration time of the temporary priority by using the timeout parameter . Second , state precedence encodes the space - specific restrictions by specifying priorities among states . In the example of a guesthouse , the owner may grant a high priority to the OFF state . It leads Hivemind to turn off the lobby lights unless all visitors prefer to turn them on . 6 . 2 . 3 Putting things together . Hivemind compares scores of three primitives lexicographically . A space admin sets up the priority of the primitives . An example configuration for playlists would be [ state precedence ( on the current playlist ) , fairness , efficiency ] . In this configuration , Hivemind first applies state precedence to decide the next playlist . It then uses fairness and efficiency in the case of tie states . We note that lexicographical ordering could easily be replaced with the ordering of weighted sum . 7 INFLUENCE - AWARE AUTHORIZATION In § 5 and § 6 , we explored our design question on how to make the way of control from being exclusive into collective . In this section , we discuss another core question : “ To whom should we entitle / grant control , e . g . , give the right to vote ? ” . It is about altering today’s autho - rization model of the IoT actuator , currently based on the physical access to a dedicated controller and / or online authentication of the user who demonstrated the ownership . As a fundamental policy for determining the eligibility to vote , we propose influence - aware authorization . The rationale is to “give rights only to those who are directly affected by the actuator” . For example , giving rights to those who can hear the music from the speaker , or whose surrounding air temperature is affected by the heater . In other words , when optimizing the utility of an actuator , we take into account the preferences of ( and only of ) those who physically perceive the utility of the actuator . What is equally im - portant is to make sure Hivemind excludes those who are currently out of the actuator’s influence from voting . An external vote would interfere with the actuator serving the best interests of the visitors . In an extreme case , an external vote might be a malicious one to sabotage the place’s environment . 7 . 1 Considering Actuators’ Area of Influence For influence - aware authorization , Hivemind should continuously monitor whether a visitor is in an actuator’s area of influence ( AoI ) . Considering that public spaces are freely accessible to anyone , it would be impossible to predict who will be in an actuator’s AoI at the moment . To accomplish such a task , we took two different approaches based on the complexity of AoI . 1 ) Localization - based approximation . One family of actuators is the actuators designed to keep the space’s ambient environment to be spatially uniform and temporally steady , such as heaters , air conditioners , air purifiers , diffusers , and humidifiers . For efficiency , it is likely that there are walls already in place enclosing such an actuator so that the actuator’s effect does not dissipate away . Thus , the AoI of this family of actuators are intrinsically confined by the spatial division such as a room . So , the AoI could be estimated by adopting room - level localization techniques [ 10 , 12 , 22 , 59 , 115 , 118 , 130 ] or proximity detection ( e . g . , BLE beacons ) . Even for a very large place with uncertain borders ( e . g . , airport terminals , hotel lobbies ) , the AoI of an actuator could be statically determined by building - wide HVAC simulation tools [ 31 ] . 2 ) Physical influence sensing . However , for the other family of actuators , i . e . , public displays , speakers , and lighting fixtures , room - level localization or proximity detection techniques are not sufficient to estimate whether a user is in the actuator’s AoI . Such 473 MobiSys ’21 , June 24 – July 2 , 2021 , Virtual , WI , USA Wonjung Kim et al . Table 1 : Comparison among different audio features Raw Acoustic - fingerprint WSSIM MFCC Macro avg .

Figure 4 : Perception - aware influence detection for speakers actuators’ influence exhibits directionality and decays over dis - tance , resulting in a very complex shape of AoI . Surrounding ob - jects may occlude , reflect , or diffract the emitted video , sound , and light . External noise or light ( e . g . , sunlight ) may mask the visitors’ perception . The intensity of and contents within the signal ( e . g . , speaker volume and a genre of music ) affects the AoI , too . More im - portantly , these factors do not stay static , rather change over time . This makes it almost impossible to simulate or pre - profile these actuators’ AoI in advance . Addressing these challenges , we present a perception - aware influence detection strategy that complements localization - based strategy . Below , we detail our strategy for public IoT speakers and discuss its possible extensions and limitations . 7 . 2 Perception - aware Influence Detection Our strategy is inspired from how people naturally perceive sounds : “Do you hear what the speaker is playing ? Then you are under its in - fluence . ” Mimicking this strategy at mobile devices , we leverage the temporal correlation between the source signals from the speaker and the received signals at the visitor’s smartphone at an arbitrary location . We consider the visitor is in the AoI if the correlation ex - ceeds a threshold . This strategy naturally eliminates the necessity for sophisticated models and calibration of the acoustic environ - ment incorporating many indirect , place - specific attributes . Also , it is straightforward to consider genre - or content - dependencies . Temporal correlation - based approach has been widely explored in mobile system communities , especially to detect the co - location of users and devices using audio signals [ 118 , 126 ] . We adopt their principles in part to directly measure the degree of physical influ - ence visitors receive from the actuator . Fig . 4 shows the perception - aware influence detection pipeline . A user’s smartphone records the surrounding audio for a short time frame , extracts audio features , i . e . , MFCC , and sends it to the Hive - mind server . Hivemind server concurrently extracts MFCC from the source audio , synchronizes the time offset of the two feature segments , and calculates the time - averaged correlation distance be - tween them . If the aggregated distance exceeds a certain threshold , Hivemind considers that the user is in the AoI of the speaker . For the selection of the audio feature , we comparatively evaluated the performance of 4 different features used in audio similarity mea - surement or co - location detection – raw signal , MFCC , Short - time Fourier transform ( STFT ) - based audio fingerprint [ 126 ] , and WS - SIM 2 [ 14 ] – with the data collected from § 9 . 3 . MFCC was selected for its best performance ( Table 1 ) . In addition , we further optimized 2 Weighted SSIM ( WSSIM ) is used for measuring the similarity of two acoustic signals . performance by ignoring the case when the source audio volume is low , and increased battery life using duty cycling . Extension to non - speaker type actuators . The proposed strat - egy is an intuitive way to measure the physical influence of the actuators without requiring any pre - profiling or simulation . But under the hood , two requirements restrict its applicability : the “sig - nal” from the actuator must ( i ) show a unique pattern , and ( ii ) be continuously monitored from a smartphone . This hinders the di - rect adoption of such a strategy to a few other types of actuators . Lightings lack unique patterns needed to see the temporal correla - tion . Public displays cannot be monitored “continuously” through a smartphone camera . For actuators without a unique pattern , applying unperceivable side - channel communication could be considered . For the case of lightings , we may leverage visible light - based localization tech - niques [ 73 , 85 , 105 , 123 , 130 ] . The seemingly steady light could carry human - invisible modulated signals , which are picked up by the light sensor of the visitors’ smartphone followed by the same strategy , i . e . , server - side evaluation of temporal correlations . Nonetheless , perception - aware influence detection for public displays remains unsolved . We may think of wearable ego - centric cameras as a possible influence - monitoring sensor , but wearable cameras are still far from wide deployment . In addition , influence detection for vision signals needs further investigations . We leave an extension to public displays as future work . 7 . 3 Authorization Flow The authorization flow of Hivemind comprises two steps . 1 ) Site discovery . As described earlier ( § 4 . 3 ) , a visitor’s smartphone first recognizes the encountered site using a BLE beacon . Along with the site identifier , the beacon broadcasts a short - lived token , which changes every 5 seconds , to prevent replay attacks [ 11 ] . 2 ) Influence - aware authorization . For each discovered actuator , the smartphone requests authorization to the Hivemind server . Hivemind leverages either room - level localization or perception - aware influence detection depending on the family of the actuator . Our current implementation uses BLE RSSI - based thresholding as an approximation of room - level localization , and further uses audio - based influence detection for IoT speakers . To realize audio - based influence - aware authorization , the Hive - mind server should capture the source signal the speaker is playing . However , we observed cases where the speaker’s audio source is not extractable . Furthermore , the audio source itself does not fully reflect the distortion due to the speaker hardware and the physical acoustic environment . To circumvent the case of unavail - able audio sources and mitigate the distortion issues , we installed a microphone - equipped Raspberry Pi right next to the speaker , which samples the actual source signal out of the speaker . 8 IMPLEMENTATION 8 . 1 Mobile - side App of Hivemind Instant participation . To support instant participation , the app generates the control interfaces for the site upon its discovery . The app fetches the list of nearby actuators from the server and displays them . The app also generates voting UI suitable to the actuator , 474 Hivemind : Social Control - and - Use of IoT towards Democratization of Public Spaces MobiSys ’21 , June 24 – July 2 , 2021 , Virtual , WI , USA a b c Figure 5 : Hivemind app screenshots : ( a ) List of actuators , ( b ) Aggregation result UI , ( c ) Voting UI for a speaker volume such as Selection UI for choosing discrete options or Slider for continuous numbers ( See Fig . 5 ) . For the field deployment ( § 9 . 4 ) , we published the app on Play Store 3 . We note the app works across the deployment sites . Energy - latency trade - off of Device Discoverer . We balance energy efficiency and responsiveness of Device Discoverer by dy - namically changing the duty cycle of authorization . We prioritize responsiveness when the app is in the foreground mode , and energy efficiency when the app is in background mode . Fig . 6 shows the power states and their power consumption . We further introduce a grace period of 1 minute in exit detection to avoid potential false expulsion . We note that , in the site discovery state , Device Dis - coverer performs beacon scan every 15 to 20 minutes , as decided upon the Android’s restriction on background job execution . 8 . 2 Embracing Diversity of IoT Connectivity . We implement the Hivemind control server running in the cloud . The server leverages an interoperability layer to com - municate with actuators through the Internet . However , we found that not all actuators are accessible from the cloud . We encountered two cases where Hivemind cannot directly access actuators : ( i ) de - vices hidden behind local routers with NAT , e . g . , Chromecast [ 98 ] , and ( ii ) devices that support only Bluetooth [ 97 ] or Zigbee [ 101 ] . While ( i ) could be easily resolved without additional devices if the WiFi router supports technologies such as tunneling or port forwarding , it is not always an available option . To address the connectivity issues where infrastructure support is not available , we install an additional device near the actuator , which mediates the connection between the control server and the actuator . We used Raspberry Pi connected to the cloud through Cloud Connector [ 100 ] of OpenHAB , which makes a reverse connection to the cloud server . Describing to users . The state variables of IoT actuators are some - times not self - explanatory to end - users . We implement State De - scriptor which provides human - readable description to the given state . For instance , it provides a currently playing program for TV channels by monitoring Electronic Program Guide ( EPG ) [ 32 ] . For Spotify playlist URI , it provides a thumbnail , title , and description . 3 Play Store URL : https : / / kaist . page . link / hivemind 8 . 3 Scheduling Preference Aggregation Hivemind triggers preference aggregation ( a ) periodically and ( b ) upon changes in participants’ preferences . A minimum time interval ( e . g . , 1 second ) between the aggregation was introduced for the throttling of actuator commands . From the stress test , we observed floods of actuator commands lead to malfunction of some actuators . 8 . 4 Admin - side Setup Cost The current implementation requires an auxiliary device for con - nectivity , authorization , and discovery , to avoid the modification to the actuator itself . We used one Raspberry Pi 4 per installation site for prototyping . In our experience of installing Hivemind for the deployment ( § 9 . 4 ) , it took less than an hour . There existed auxiliary tasks specific to a device , e . g . , recording IR codes for TV channels , registering a device to Spotify , etc . Lastly , the admin describes the aggregation policy using the admin console ( Fig . 7 ) . Note that the entire installation procedure per actuator is a one - time cost . 9 EVALUATION We evaluate Hivemind in two phases . First , we conduct controlled experiments under lab - settings to measure the latency , energy over - head , and influence - aware authorization performances . Next , from the deployment of Hivemind in five public spaces for 4 weeks , we report our field deployment experiences and feedback from the general public who visited the Hivemind - deployed places . 9 . 1 Latency Overhead of Hivemind A participant in democratic control of an actuator experiences mul - tiple delay factors such as from the social decision - making process and the operation of the actuator . Hivemind imposes extra latency overhead to the process , which we defined as the time delay from the user’s voting on the Hivemind app until the API call on the IoT actuator . We examine if the latency overhead is insignificant enough to not disrupt the entire process . Furthermore , we tested if the IoT actuators are well supported by Hivemind . The following ( actuator , its function ) pairs are evaluated : ( Samsung TV , channel ) , ( Broadlink RM3 , command 4 ) , ( Chromecast , play uri ) , ( Tuya Smart - plug , on / off ) , ( Mi Air Purifier 3H , fan level ) , ( YeeLight LED Bulb , lighting effect ) , ( Spotify , volume and playlist ) . Hivemind is configured so that a single user’s vote immediately triggers the process towards API call , without waiting for other users’ votes . We repeated the measurement 20 times for 8 different IoT devices . Table 2 tabulates the result . The average total delay is 420 . 57 msec , showing that Hivemind introduces little latency overhead unlikely to degrade the user experiences . The API translation by OpenHAB shows a large standard deviation , and is explained by the implementation details in OpenHAB bindings . For example , the Chromecast binding performs multiple round - trips of WebSocket messaging for synchronization before sending the command , which adds significant latency overhead . Interestingly , the Samsung TV binding implements the channel command by emulating a human’s button - pressing behaviors , invoking multiple button press APIs with 300 msec of pause in between . 4 IR command for universal IR remote 475 MobiSys ’21 , June 24 – July 2 , 2021 , Virtual , WI , USA Wonjung Kim et al .

The app comprises two major power states ( Fig . 6 ) : ( 1 ) site discovery , where the app performs a periodic beacon scanning for actua - tor discovery , and ( 2 ) exit monitoring , where the app conducts influence - aware authorization to monitor whether a user with an active vote stays within actuators’ AoI . Depending on the sensors used , the exit monitoring state can be configured into two oper - ating modes : ( 2a ) beacon - only and ( 2b ) beacon - and - mic . There also exists a transient app opened state where a user interacts with the app in the foreground , such as browsing a list of actuators or expressing one’s preference , which is omitted in the measurement . Method . We measured power consumption on an Android 11 - installed Pixel 4 using Battery Historian [ 41 ] . We factory - reset the phone before each measurement . We used the same device to minimize the dependency on the battery hardware [ 28 ] . Result . The energy overhead of site discovery and exit monit - oring ( beacon - only and beacon - and - mic ) were 0 . 26 mW , 13 . 87 mW , and 38 . 50 mW , respectively . The standby power consumption of a factory - reset Pixel 4 was 97 . 74 mW . 9 . 3 Influence - aware Authorization We evaluated perception - aware influence detection ( § 7 . 2 ) for the case of an IoT speaker . First , we conducted an in - lab experiment to collect data , build the influence detection model , and compare it with a baseline . Then , we further evaluated the influence detection model in a real - world public space . Experimental setup . As discussed in § 7 , speakers’ area of influ - ence ( AoI ) changes upon various situational and environmental factors . In this experiment , we controlled the following factors : type of noise , music , obstacles in the middle of direct sound propagation paths , and distance from the speaker ( Table 3 and Fig . 8 ) . The evaluation was conducted in an auditorium of size 20m × 20m . We hand - picked 16 positions which show distinct characteristics . 𝐴 1 - 𝐴 2 are behind the pulpit ( partially occluded ) , 𝐵 1 - 𝐵 11 are inside the auditorium ( no occlusion ) , 𝐶 1 - 𝐶 2 are the corridors outside the auditorium ( partially occluded , far - away from the speaker ) , and 𝐷 1 is the sound room ( fully occluded ) . Ground truth collection . We recruited 10 participants from the campus . After a brief introduction , each participant experienced 12 combinations of music and noise . During the session , participants freely roamed around the auditorium , and at each of the 16 positions , they labeled “yes” or “no” in response to the question “Do you hear the speaker well enough to claim a right to vote at this position ? ” The participants exchanged their viewpoints with each other , which are known exercises devised in human knowledge aggregation research to facilitate consensus on delicate subjective matters [ 25 , 30 , 93 ] . Overall , we collected a total of 12 × 16 = 192 ground truth data points and 65 . 62 % of them were “yes” . The result showed high agreement among the participants . They unanimously agreed to 78 . 65 % of ( position , music & noise ) combinations . The disagreement score – the entropy of comprising individual labels – was as low as 0 . 14 ( SD = 0 . 08 ) . This can be considered very low given that the entropy score is 0 . 47 when only one out of 10 people disagrees . Metric . We used the macro average of 𝐹 1 score . Leave - one - out cross - validation was performed to the types of music and noise . Baseline . Our hypothesis is that our temporal correlation - based technique better adapts to additive noises and occlusions , compared to room - level localization . To validate , we set BLE beacon RSSI - based AoI membership classification as a baseline . Results . Fig . 9 shows the 𝐹 1 scores of the proposed method and baseline . Our method achieved a macro average 𝐹 1 score of 0 . 91 , outperforming BLE beacon RSSI - based technique by 7 . 6 % on aver - age . The difference was particularly high ( 21 . 6 % ) when no noise was played . This is due to our experimental setting ; under the noise , the AoI boundary was effectively confined to the main room ( 𝐵 𝑖 in Fig . 8 ) and easily approximated by room - level localization ( i . e . , beacon’s RSSI ) . However , when there was no noise , the music was clearly audible across the walls ( 𝐴 𝑖 and 𝐶 𝑖 ) . This made the AoI boundary complicated , making room - level localization inadequate . We also analyzed how well our method adapts to dynamic envi - ronmental change . We selected positions with the most frequent yes / no flips in the ground truth . Fig . 10 shows the proposed tech - nique’s performance on 4 positions with the highest label entropy . The proposed technique outperformed the baseline as much as 58 . 7 % , highlighting the proposed technique’s adaptability . Accuracy in an unconstrained environment . We further eval - uated the proposed influence detection technique in a real - world environment . We chose a food court among Hivemind - deployed sites ( Table 4 ) ; the place was equipped with an IoT speaker and was exposed to various noises ( e . g . , conversation , blender , and people passing by ) . The same participants and the question were used for labeling . We asked each participant to experience two different 476 Hivemind : Social Control - and - Use of IoT towards Democratization of Public Spaces MobiSys ’21 , June 24 – July 2 , 2021 , Virtual , WI , USA Figure 8 : Floor plan for evaluation of influence - aware authorization Table 3 : Musics & Noises Music / Noise Characteristics Music AnneMarie - 2002 Pop , femalevoice ( 67 . 1dB ) Eminem - Godzilla Hip - hop , malevoice ( 67 . 6dB ) JohannesBrahms Classic , instrumental - HungarianDanceno . 5 ( 63 . 5dB ) Noise None - Constructionnoise Excavatornoise ( 59 . 8dB ) Radio ( news ) Femaleannouncervoice ( 45 . 3dB ) Pubnoise Whitenoise ( 54 . 7dB ) 0 . 84 0 . 85 0 . 82 0 . 74 0 . 85 0 . 84 0 . 89 0 . 90 0 . 94 0 . 85 0 . 95 0 . 90 0 . 88 0 . 94 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 music : Godzilla music : 2002 music : Hungarian noise : none noise : constr . noise : radio noise : pub M a c r o a v g .

At each seat , the participants listened to the music – 2002 ( Table 3 ) – for 6 minutes . As the external noises were not controlled , we asked the participants to label yes / no every 20 seconds . While labeling , we placed two smartphones around each participant to collect the audio signals : one on the table and the other inside the participants’ pockets . We then evaluated the performance of the same model built in the in - lab experiment . Our influence detection model achieved macro average 𝐹 1 score of 0 . 84 . 9 . 4 Field Deployment To understand the usability of Hivemind , we conducted a field deployment . We chose to deploy the system in ordinary public spaces , e . g . , a cafeteria and a pub . We aimed at observing a long - term stable operation of Hivemind in real - world settings as well as user acceptance and usefulness . We installed Hivemind in 5 public spaces in South Korea for 4 weeks ( Dec . 2020 – Jan . 2021 ) . Procedure . The study consisted of three steps , experience , sur - vey , and interview . First , we let visitors in deployment sites ( see Table 4 ) freely use Hivemind . For visitors new to Hivemind , we attached advertisement flyers to these sites with an app download link . Second , after experiencing Hivemind , visitors were requested to participate in the survey . The survey included questions about user satisfaction and agency , the System Usability Scale ( SUS ) [ 16 ] , and opinions and suggestions . Third , we conducted a half - hour - long semi - structured interview to better understand the experience of visitors . We recruited participants from those who finished the survey . The survey and interview participants were compensated with a gift card worth USD 5 and 9 , respectively . We did not ask sensitive personal information unrelated to this study ( e . g . , age and occupation ) . The study was approved by the university IRB . 9 . 4 . 1 Findings . During the deployment , 66 users installed the Hive - mind app . 33 visitors participated in the usability survey and among them , 7 were recruited for the interview . Most participants enjoyed ( c ) ( e ) strongly disagree disagree neutral agree strongly agree ( a ) 100 80 60 40 20 0 20 40 60 80 100 Percent ( d ) ( f ) ( b ) 100 80 60 40 20 0 20 40 60 80 100 Percent Figure 11 : Survey responses ( a ) “Overall , were you satisfied with the use of Hivemind ? ” ( b ) “Were you satisfied with being able to control actuators in public spaces ? ” ( c ) “Were you satisfied with the result of the aggregation ? ” ( d ) “Were you satisfied with the control UI of the mobile app ? ” ( e ) “Do you think that your preference was reflected quickly ? ” ( f ) “Do you think that the aggregation result is fair ? ” using Hivemind . The average SUS score was 85 . 2 , implying high usability [ 109 ] . Participants also shared positive impressions ; 28 survey participants responded that they were satisfied with using Hivemind ( Fig . 11a ) . Four survey participants further recommended other public spaces where they wanted to install Hivemind . Usefulness of democratization of public actuators . Partici - pants were impressed that they could control actuators through Hivemind , which they considered impossible before . 31 ( 94 % ) survey participants responded that they were satisfied with being able to control public actuators ( Fig . 11b ) . From the interview , two par - ticipants shared their bad experiences in the past , in which they were unable to control the temperature in a conference hall and the radio volume in an intercity bus . They strongly empathized with the need for Hivemind for such public spaces . Also , the interview participants agreed on the necessity of influence - aware authoriza - tion . One interviewee said , “Votes should be given to people who can see the TV . Otherwise , someone could mess with it from outside . ” In - terestingly , Hivemind was also considered useful to the pub owner . The pub owner often wanted to gather the visitors’ opinions to set the background music , but gave up due to the cost of asking visitors individually . She mentioned , “Thanks to Hivemind , I could reflect the visitors’ opinions without any effort . ” One participant was not satisfied with the control UI ( Fig . 11d ) , because of a bug in the aggregation result UI ( Fig . 5b ) . We immediately fixed this issue . Acceptance of aggregation results . We often observed situations in which multiple visitors used Hivemind at the same time , which naturally led to the aggregation process . During the deployment , the concurrent user count was up to 6 ( Office and Pub ) . 24 ( 73 % ) survey participants were satisfied with the aggregation result ( see Fig . 11c ) . We further asked about the responsiveness ( Fig . 11e ) and fairness ( Fig . 11f ) of the aggregation . 22 ( 67 % ) and 24 ( 73 % ) answered that the preference aggregation was responsive and fair , respectively . 477 MobiSys ’21 , June 24 – July 2 , 2021 , Virtual , WI , USA Wonjung Kim et al . However , three respondents answered that their preferences were not reflected quickly . Since they did not participate in the interview , we could not obtain reasons behind the negative responses . We found that participants accepted the aggregation result even when the result differed from their own preferences . 11 survey par - ticipants reported that they experienced such a situation . Among them , 10 had no complaints because Hivemind took their prefer - ences into consideration during decision making so they accepted the majority decision . This result aligned well with the interview . However , one interviewee , who visited the pub , was concerned that Hivemind did not seem to guarantee when his preferred playlist would finally be played . He suggested providing a rough estimation of the time when a user’s preferred option would be chosen . Suggestions . Participants suggested several features to improve Hivemind , e . g . , offering an additional ( TV volume ) or fine - grained controllability ( diffusion intensity instead of on / off ) , enabling votes for disliking options , providing an estimated time for one’s pre - ferred playlist to be selected , and giving privilege to regular visitors . We believe that these suggestions are helpful to improve Hivemind . 10 DISCUSSION Preference elicitation . The design of Voting UI could be further improved . We observe that many participants spend time finding their preferred values through several trials . Applying Preference elicitation would be a good direction ; it has been broadly studied in Politics , Economics , HCI , and AI [ 9 , 21 , 72 ] . Feedbacks attained upon the changes in the actuator setting [ 34 , 104 ] could be useful in guiding the iterative process . Also , requesting feedbacks in relative forms ( e . g . , “too hot - hot - OK - cold - too cold” ) would be helpful [ 24 ] . Prioritization of visitors . Oftentimes , properly prioritizing the visitors and their preferences would be more desirable than adher - ing to flat fairness . It would be useful to protect the vulnerable such as the elderly and the sick ; for example , the AC of a bus could be set for a higher temperature upon having a child with cold in the bus , even if it conflicts with the majority’s preference . Similarly , Hivemind can grant higher privileges to frequent visitors . With their profiles available , how to prioritize them may be open for the site administrator’s adjustment . Hivemind would also provide a reference policy that is acceptable to the community’s norm . We leave further investigations as future work . Privacy and security . Hivemind uses an anonymous voting sys - tem . Visitors can collectively control actuators without exposing their personal preferences to others . However , this anonymity can be broken when there are extremely few people , such as two . A visitor could infer the other’s preference from the consensus result or voting status [ 106 ] . We admit that this could be a limitation . However , we note that this privacy issue is not a new problem in collective decision - making in public spaces ; e . g . , we could easily recognize the preferred channel of who holds the remote control . Addressing such a problem would require further research . A malicious user could be tempted to obtain the voting privilege through a replay attack or wormhole attack [ 50 ] . Hivemind would adopt security mechanisms against wormhole attacks [ 11 , 63 , 90 ] . Another dimension of security threats includes antisocial behavior such as trolling [ 46 ] . For example , a group of people could attack the system by quickly and frequently changing actuator states thereby disrupting other visitors . To address the trolling issue , we may adopt techniques in fields of online community and social media such as banning [ 19 , 111 ] , reputation system [ 23 , 75 ] , guidelines [ 91 ] , and moderators [ 102 ] . 11 RELATED WORK System support for IoT ecosystem There has been an extensive amount of work on interoperability of IoT devices and services - messaging protocols [ 92 , 112 , 120 ] , Internet connectivity [ 60 , 125 ] , etc [ 4 , 45 , 55 , 67 , 86 , 94 , 99 ] . Hivemind is built on top of these technologies , and can further adapt for extending coverage . Automaticcontrolofactuators withintelligence . Severalsensor - driven systems have been proposed to control actuators : HVAC [ 2 , 6 , 44 , 122 ] , lighting [ 64 , 114 ] , humidifier [ 1 ] , and robots [ 61 ] . A few systems [ 44 , 66 , 114 ] take user preferences into account . Unlike ours , they only support a specific actuator . Hivemind opens up the channel to explicitly reflect user preferences for generic actuators . Computational - support for co - located public . Technologies for co - located public have been proposed for various objectives : gaming [ 129 ] , sensing [ 18 , 79 , 80 ] , collective visualization [ 124 ] , co - located class [ 47 , 51 , 52 ] , interaction monitoring [ 53 , 54 , 56 , 62 , 69 , 81 ] , safety precaution [ 57 ] , etc [ 20 , 70 ] . Hivemind newly empowers the crowd to control the IoT actuators collectively . Localization and co - location detection . Hivemind’s influence - aware authorization is closely related to indoor localization tech - niques . Extensive prior works have studied room - level localiza - tion [ 12 , 38 , 49 , 74 , 89 , 113 , 121 ] . As we mentioned in § 7 , however , those techniques cannot be adopted to actuators with AoI that are easily affected by the environmental changes , such as speakers . Sev - eral co - location detection and localization approaches have been proposed using sounds [ 5 , 83 , 110 , 119 , 126 , 127 ] . However , they mostly focus on matching acoustic features from ambient sounds , and do not reflect the human perception of a specific sound source . 12 CONCLUSION In this paper , we propose a 5 - layered architecture for social control - and - use of IoT devices . Built on top of the architecture , we present Hivemind , a first - of - a - kind system that enables instant user partici - pation to incorporate the diversity of public spaces , actuators , and users , while seamlessly serving a single representative to conven - tional IoT interfaces . Field deployment on five real - world public spaces demonstrated its acceptance , usability , and usefulness to the public crowd .
