We evaluated the dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in 242 individuals from 60 family clusters , including 30 healthcare workers ( HCW ) and 30 patients , in São Paulo city . Sixty index cases with COVID - 19 were selected , being 30 HCW index cases from Hospital São Paulo ( HSP ) and its 93 household contacts and 30 index case patients from Hospital Infantil Sabará ( HIS ) and its 89 household contacts . Asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals participating were tested for COVID - 19 . The secondary attack rates in the fam - ily clusters of HCW and HIS patients were 37 . 63 % and 68 . 54 % , respectively . Considering all households , the transmission from adults to children was 55 . 4 % , while the transmission from children to children was 37 . 5 % . Children were more infected if the index case was an adult , suggesting that children were less competent to transmit . The average time for a household to be COVID - 19 positive was 4 and 3 days for HCW and HIS patients . Although HCW have a higher risk of infection and social vulnerability , the secondary attack rate was lower than that observed for HIS patients , possibly because HCW are more aware of transmission risks than the general community . Keywords COVID - 19 · Household transmission · Children · Healthcare workers · SARS - CoV - 2 Introduction As of April 2022 , more than half - billion cases of coronavi - rus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome - related coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , were confirmed worldwide , with more than 6 . 1 million related deaths [ 1 ] . About 6 % of cases and 10 . 6 % of deaths occurred in Brazil since the first case of COVID - 19 was confirmed on 26 February 2020 [ 2 ] . The first investigation of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in a family cluster in China reported a high rate ( 85 . 71 % ) of intra - family transmission [ 3 ] . Understanding the epidemiology of COVID - 19 in chil - dren and adults is important . Children are usually the main drivers of respiratory viral outbreaks , whereas the number of COVID - 19 cases is much lower in children than in adults [ 4 , 5 ] . On the other hand , adults , especially healthcare work - ers ( HCW ) , are at increased risk of infection due to long working hours and exposure to infected patients [ 6 ] . Thus , COVID - 19 in children , adults , HCW , and the impact of familial transmission became an important issue . Studies on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission within households are limited , with , to the best of our knowledge , two related studies in Brazil so far [ 7 , 8 ] . In this study , we evaluated the transmission dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 in asymptomatic and symptomatic households in family clusters of HCW in a general hospital ( Hospital São Paulo — HSP ) and patients in a pediatric hospital ( Hos - pital Infantil Sabará — HIS ) .

A family clus - ter was characterized by having at least three individu - als , including one child ( under 18 years old ) . HCW were described as all professionals having direct and indirect contact with infected patients . We prospectively investigated the transmission dynam - ics of SARS - CoV - 2 in 60 family clusters from 16 April to 3 November 2020 , of which 30 were from HCW working at HSP and 30 from pediatric patients attended at HIS . To determine the index case , the HSP HCW , HIS patients , and their household contacts were interviewed to obtain clini - cal , epidemiological , and demographic data and the poten - tial source of infection . All households have been tested by SARS - CoV - 2 real - time reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - qPCR ) using the CDC protocol [ 9 ] . We recruited HCW and patients who sought their respective healthcare services for the COVID - 19 diagnos - tic test and were promptly confirmed positive for SARS - CoV - 2 infection . All investigated pediatric patients from HIS had any comorbidity and were previously healthy . They were included only due to SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Respiratory samples were collected with nasopharyn - geal swabs and stored in 2 mL of sterile lactated Ringer’s solution before RNA extraction with Quick - RNA Viral Kit ( Zymo Research , USA ) , following the manufacturer’s instructions . All participants were monitored for 14 days , and sample collection of households occurred during the first week of the index case home isolation . A new test was made 7 days later if the first result was negative . We investigated the secondary attack rate for each fam - ily , the odds ratio ( OR ) of transmission for children and adult contacts , with a 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , and the Fisher’s exact test for categorical data . All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 . 0 ( GraphPad Software , CA , USA ) , with p < 0 . 01 considered statistically significant . Results The 60 investigated family clusters comprised 242 indi - viduals ( 123 from HSP and 119 from HIS ) . In the 30 fam - ily clusters of HIS patients , 19 adults ( 63 . 33 % ) and 11 children ( 36 . 66 % ) were identified as the index cases . In the cluster of HSP , all 30 HCW ( 23 female and 7 male ) were the index cases . The 30 investigated HCW were composed of eight nurse technicians , seven physicians , six administrative staff , four nursing assistants , two nurses , one physiotherapist , one psychologist , and one radiology technician . The mean age of HCW index cases was 42 years old ( 19 to 60 years old ) . The number of household contacts varied from 2 to 9 . The mean age of adult households was 47 years old ( 18 – 83 ) and 9 years old ( 10 months – 17 years ) for children . Ninety - three households were investigated ( 50 adults and 43 children ) , of which 35 had a positive result ( 21 adults and 14 children ) , and 25 . 71 % ( 9 / 35 ) were asymptomatic ( 5 adults and 4 children ) , resulting in a secondary attack rate of 37 . 63 % ( 35 / 93 ) . The mean age of positive adults and children was 45 years ( 18 to 83 ) and 8 years ( 10 months to16 years ) , respectively , with the number of infected households varying from 0 to 3 . At least one individual was infected in 19 family clusters ( 63 . 33 % ) and none in eleven ( 36 . 7 % ) . The time in days that a household of HCW took to be tested positive ranged from 1 to 9 . The 30 family clusters of HIS patients comprised 89 members ( 50 adults and 39 children ) , with a mean age of adults and children households of 40 years old ( 31 to 60 ) and 4 years old ( 1 month to 7 years ) , respectively . The number of household contacts ranged from 2 to 7 . A total of 61 house - holds were positive ( 31 adults and 30 children ) , resulting in a secondary attack of 68 . 54 % ( 61 / 89 ) , of which 11 . 47 % ( 7 / 61 ) were asymptomatic . The time in days that a household of HIS took to be tested positive ranged from 1 to 6 . Adults , with an average age of 34 years old ( ranging from 19 to 47 ) , were the index cases in 19 family clusters from HIS , with 59 households ( 31 children and 28 adults ) in total , and were responsible for a secondary attack rate of 71 . 86 % ( 42 / 59 ) , of which 64 . 28 % ( 27 / 42 ) were children , and 35 . 71 % ( 15 / 42 ) were adults . Children , with an average age of a year old ( ranging from 1 month to 7 years ) , were the index case in 11 family clusters from HIS , with 30 households ( 8 children and 22 adults ) in total , and were responsible for a secondary attack rate of 63 . 33 % ( 19 / 30 ) , of which 84 . 21 % ( 16 / 19 ) were adults , and 15 . 79 % ( 3 / 19 ) were children . In children , the total secondary attack rate was 53 . 66 % ( 44 / 82 ) , of which 61 . 36 % ( 27 / 44 ) , 31 . 82 % ( 14 / 44 ) , and 6 . 82 % ( 3 / 44 ) had an adult , an HCW , and a child as the index case , respectively . In adults , the total secondary attack rate was 52 . 0 % ( 52 / 100 ) , of which 28 . 85 % ( 15 / 52 ) , 40 . 38 % ( 21 / 52 ) , and 30 . 77 % ( 16 / 52 ) , and had an adult , an HCW , and a child as the index case , respectively . The odds of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission when the index case was an adult were 13 . 98 and 11 . 25 higher when com - pared to HCW and children as index cases , respectively ( Table 1 ) . 1346 Brazilian Journal of Microbiology ( 2022 ) 53 : 1345 – 1348 1 3 Discussion We reported the data on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in 60 family clusters from one general and one pediatric hospital . Household transmission is important , with adults being more affected [ 10 ] , as observed in our study , regardless of whether the index case was adult , child , or HCW . Children did not frequently transmit to other children , and we observed that transmission occurred more from children to adults . How - ever , the odds of children having an infection from adults were higher when compared to a child , but it should be inter - preted with caution once the study was conducted when the schools were closed [ 11 – 13 ] . There is little evidence about the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission within HCW households . However , besides the frequent contact with the public , low - income professionals , in general , routinely utilize public transport during rush hours [ 14 ] . Consequently , they are at a higher risk of expo - sure [ 15 ] , supporting the argument that the SARS - CoV - 2 transmission dynamics are driven by social inequalities and vulnerabilities [ 16 ] . A systematic review of 11 studies reported that 10 % of patients infected by SARS - CoV - 2 were HCW [ 17 ] . In our study , the HCW occupation with the highest number of index cases was nurse technicians . In another study with HCW who had direct contact with patients , the most con - taminated group was also nurse technicians , with those reporting daily patient contact having the highest infection rate [ 18 ] . We observed a SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in HCW families of 37 . 63 % , relatively lower than in HIS patients , possibly because HCW are more aware of transmission risks than the general community and had privileged access to a rapid diagnostic service . The time after contact with the index case may be impor - tant in the dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . We observed that the average time of index case transmission was 3 . 4 days . In fact , during infection , the viral load reaches its peak at the beginning of the onset of symptoms , with the highest viral loads being observed in the first 5 days , indicating a high level of infectiousness and a higher risk of secondary transmission during this period [ 19 ] . Of the total 96 households infected , 16 . 67 % ( 16 / 96 ) were asymptomatic . In a similar study in South Korea , with recruited participants from a community facility designated for the isolation of patients with mild symptoms of COVID - 19 , the asymptomatic rate of infection was 19 . 2 % [ 20 ] . Our results have shown that family clusters will continue to be an important environment for SARS - CoV - 2 transmis - sion since individuals with suspected or confirmed infection are isolated at home . Some points should be mentioned as limitations of the study . As the city of São Paulo went through some quaran - tine periods , impacting mainly the school activity suspended during the study , it may have influenced the number of chil - dren identified as index cases . We also observed that some children presented symptoms 1 or 2 days after the adult index case . It was not possible to verify whether it was a household infection in these cases . In addition , the index case groups are composed of highly selected individuals ( i . e . , HCW and patients from a pediatric hospital ) that have very peculiar characteristics that differentiate them from the general population . For example , in two Brazilian studies in the general community , the infection rate in children varied from 22 . 8 to 25 . 1 % , and both concluded that children are not significant sources of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in their households and most frequently acquire the virus from adults [ 7 , 8 ] . In our study , the infection rate in children was higher ( 55 . 66 % ) , of which 61 . 36 % had acquired COVID - 19 from adults . In this sense , the results may be interpreted with caution since the activities and routines of households of HCW and pediatric patients may be distinct from non - HCW healthy people . Thus , further studies are needed to better understand the dynamics of intrafamilial transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in children and adults . In summary , we observed that the transmission of house - hold contacts from non - HCW patients was higher than that observed for HCW households . The SARS - CoV - 2 secondary attack rate in the pediatric population was lower , suggest - ing that children are not the main drivers of infection but , conversely , acquire the infection more often from adults .
