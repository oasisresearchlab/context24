However , its reliability to analyze soft biomaterials and organs has not been tested . Here , we evaluated the utility of nanoindentation to measure the passive mechanical properties of soft biological specimen . Kidney , liver , spleen and uterus samples were harvested from C57BL / 6 N mice . We assessed test – retest repeatability in biological specimen and hydrogel controls using Bland – Altman diagrams , intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICCs ) and the within - subject coefficients of variation ( COVs ) . The results were calculated using Hertzian , JKR and Oliver & Pharr models . Similar to hydrogels , Bland – Altman plots of all biological specimen showed good reliability in stiffness test and retest examinations . In gels , ICCs were larger than 0 . 8 and COVs were smaller than 15 % in all three models . In kidney , liver , spleen and uterus , ICCs were consistently larger than 0 . 8 only in the Hertzian model but not in the JKR and Oliver & Pharr models . Similarly , COVs were consistently smaller than 15 % in kidney , liver , spleen and uterus only in the Hertzian model but not in the other models . We conclude that nanoindentation technology is feasible in detecting the stiffness of kidney , liver , spleen and uterus . The Hertzian model is the preferred method to provide reliable results on ex vivo organ stiffness of the biological specimen under study . Abbreviations Eff Effective Young’s modulus E Young’s modulus ICC Intraclass Correlation Coefficient CI Confidence Interval COV Within - subject coefficient of variation Several diseases lead to changes in stiffness in certain organs , which could give rise to illnesses . Potentially , there is also a possibility that a variation of stiffness in tissue or cells influences the function or structure in other organs in the body . For example , patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction can exhibit increases in passive myocardial stiffness 1 . Cyanotic patients with congenital heart diseases are often characterized by increased arterial stiffness in comparison with healthy population 2 . There is a direct relationship between aortic stiffness and left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction in patients with inflammatory bowel disease 3 . Eradication of hepatitis C virus infection causes a significant decline in liver stiffness - particularly in patients with high base - line level of inflammation or patients who received direct - acting antiviral agents 4 , 5 . Increased arterial stiffness can occur in parallel with the decline of glomerular filtration rate in patients with mild - to - moderate chronic kidney disease 6 .

In clinical settings , a number of various techniques have been introduced to detect changes in stiffness of human organs , such as transient elastography , ultrasonography , acoustic radiation force impulse elastography , point shear wave elastography and magnetic resonance elastography 8 – 15 , which are helpful and meaningful in diagnosis of organ fibrosis . Presently , a variety of testing techniques have been developed and utilized widespread from bulk scale to the micro / nano - scale for characterizing some biomaterials ex vivo 16 – 21 . Piuma nanoindenter is one of these technologies to be used to study elastic property of biomaterials . This technique has been widely used to test passive mechanical properties of hard biosamples , such as bone and cartilage 22 – 26 . However , so far there are only very few studies 27 – 31 which used the Nanoindentation technology to study organ stiffness of soft biomaterials , such as the kidney , liver , spleen and uterus samples . There is uncertainty on suitable ways in analyz - ing ex vivo organ stiffness by this technique . Results Hertzian , JKR and Oliver & Pharr models . We applied Hertzian , JKR and Oliver & Pharr models based on the following considerations . The calculation of the effective Young’s modulus ( Eff ) by considering the Hertz - ian contact model 36 , 37 , follows the fit of the loading curve ( Fig . 1F ) to the following equation : where P is the load in the peak of fit , R means the tip radius and h t represents the indentation depth ( Fig . 1C , D ) . The JKR model 38 is often used for analysis of elastic adhesive materials and could allow a better estimation of Eff in the presence of adhesion forces which changes the contact area ( Fig . 1G ) . However , if the unloading part shows no sticky character , it is expected that there would be no reliable result from this model ( Fig . 1E ) . The equation used for the fitting is : Eﬀ = P ∗ 3 / 4 √ R · h 3 / 2 t Figure 1 . Principle of effective Young’s modulus calculation .

For elastoplastic materials , the unloading part of the curve is often fitted by the so - called Oliver & Pharr model 39 , 40 , which may exclude plasticity bias . This method derives the Eff from the slope of the unloading part of the stress – strain curve , indenter tip radius and final indentation depth using the following formula : where dPdh is the slope at maximum indentation , R is the radius of the spherical indenter tip , h t and h r represent maximum indentation depth and final contact depth ( Fig . 1C , D , H ) . In this study , the fits were set as 100 % , 100 % and 65 – 85 % in Hertzian model , JKR model and Oliver & Pharr model , respectively . Poisson’s ratio 41 ν relates effective Young’s modulus ( Eff ) and Young’s modulus ( E ) by the following equation : Except Eff , in all models the Piuma software also enabled to directly calculate E , for which a Poisson’s ratio of 0 . 5 was pre - defined ( for perfect incompressible materials ) . We determined both Eff and E for each biomaterial because the material property of tissues and the Poisson’s ratios are unknown . Stiffness of matrigen hydrogels and organs . Bland – Altman plots of Matrigen hydrogels showed mean stiffness differences in all measurements ( Fig . 2 ) . There was only one difference ( spot ) out of the 95 % limits of agreement ( − 1 . 96 SD to 1 . 96 SD ) in the Hertzian model for both Eff and E ( Fig . 2A , D ) . Differences in the other models were within the SD range ( Fig . 2B , C , E , F ) . ICC values were larger than 0 . 8 and COVs were smaller than 15 % in all models ( Table 1 ) , which demonstrates that all three models provide reliable results on gel specimen . In the kidney , the Bland – Altman plots show that there was only one difference out of the 95 % limits of agree - ment for E in JKR model , for Eff in the Oliver & Pharr model and for E in the Oliver & Pharr model ( Fig . 3E , G , H ) . The differences in the other models were all within the SD range ( Fig . 3C , D , F ) . Of note , the ICC value was larger than 0 . 8 and the COV was smaller than 15 % only in the Hertzian model but not in the other models ( Table 2 ) . In the liver , the Bland – Altman plots uncovered mean stiffness differences between test and retest data . Except for Eff in the Hertzian model and E in the JKR model , there were no differences out of the 95 % limits of agree - ment ( Fig . 4C - H ) . The ICC values of E and Eff exceeded 0 . 8 consistently only in the Hertzian model but not Oliver & Pharr and JKR models . The COV values were smaller than 15 % in the Hertzian and Oliver & Pharr models but not in the JKR model ( Table 3 ) . In the spleen , the Bland – Altman plots showed that the average stiffness differences of test – retest data were within the SD range in the JKR model . There was only one difference result out of the scope in the Hertzian and Oliver & Pharr models ( Fig . 5C - H ) . The ICC values of E and Eff were consistently larger than 0 . 8 in the Hertzian and JKR models but not in the Oliver & Pharr model . The COVs of the E and Eff values were smaller than 15 % in Hertzian but not in the other models ( Table 4 ) . In uterus , Bland – Altman plots revealed only one difference out of the 95 % limits of agreement between indentations in both the Hertzian and JKR models ( Fig . 6D , E , G , H ) but not in Oliver & Pharr model ( Fig . 6F , I ) . ICC values were larger than 0 . 8 in Hertzian and Oliver & Pharr models but not JKR model . In contrast , COVs were smaller than 15 % only in Hertzian model but not other models ( Table 5 ) . Discussion Piuma nanoindentation technology has been widely used in research on biomaterial stiffness of hard animal organs , for example in bone 25 , in ear , ala nasi , and septum on both the cellular and the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) levels 24 , 26 , in the knee joint 22 , in articular cartilage 23 . Other examples are human donor cornea 27 , fibrotic intestinal tissue 30 , pancreatic acellular scaffolds 31 , soft plates 28 and particularly calcified aneurysmal abdominal aortas 29 . The feasibility and reliability of this technology in measuring the stiffness of soft biological materials , particularly organs ex vivo , is unknown . Compared with hard biomaterials , certain properties of soft biomaterials , such as viscoelasticity and adhesion , are more prone to deviations in nanoindentation . Our study is the first to use this technology to test the stiffness of soft biological organs ex vivo , particularly from mice , which are widely used for modeling human and animal diseases . We applied the Piuma nanoindentation technology , which is easy to use and utilizes a specific probe to measure Young’s Moduli to match with the specific sample properties h t − h 0 = a 20 R   1 + � 1 − PP adh 2   43 − 2 3 a 20 R   1 + � 1 − PP adh 2   13 P adh = − 3 2 π� rR Eﬀ = 9 π R 2 � r 2 a 30 Eﬀ = dP dh 1 2 √ R ( h t + h r ) Eﬀ = E 1 − v 2 4 Vol : .

Different tissue contains different mechanical properties , therefore , different protocols should be applied in tissues with some special characterizations 45 . Since there is no way to judge the feature of tested samples before an experiment , we analyzed both the loading and unloading parts for their elastic behavior detec - tion . In addition to the operation of the system and the development of measurement strategies , the preparation and fixation of tissue is expected to be important . An irregular tissue is impossible to be tested as the device only recognizes flat and stable surfaces , and the calculation of stiffness would be affected by the condition of sample . For example , if the tested surface is a slope ( Supplement 1 , Fig 1A ) , the contacted area would not be fully indented by the tip of probe , which means the losing depth and force could led to a mistake in stiffness measurement . A globose organ ( Supplement 1 Fig 1B ) is also untestable because it cannot be stabilized during the process of measurement . Furthermore , it is impossible for this technology to test a sunk surface ( Supplement 1 Fig 1C ) due to the obstacle at the edge of the tissue . A lumpy surface ( Supplement 1 Fig 1D ) would not only affect the accuracy of the measurement results but also cause the probe cantilever to be damaged due to jamming . Together , the tested tissue needs to be prepared testable in an appropriate shape and size . We did overcome these possible limitations for the feasibility and reliability of the nanoindentation technology to measure soft organ stiffness by using isolated kidneys , liver , spleen and uterus dissected in an appropriate manner . We confirmed the feasibility and reliability of the results by a comparative study of this technology to Matrigen hydrogels . Matrigen hydrogels at a given stiffness , stable shape , appropriate thickness and flat surface were taken as a quality control , although their given stiffness is not considered golden - standard . Nevertheless , our Bland – Altman plots , ICCs and COVs demonstrated a good reliability of the gels used . Therefore , we conclude that nanoindentation technology works well and is reliable in our laboratory settings and on this material . Figure 2 . Bland – Altman plot of Matrigen hydogels .

Although the Bland – Altman plots did not give us numerous out - of - qualification results , the reliability of the results from the four organs hardness in different models can only be validated by comparing the ICCs and COVs . In the four organs , all Hertzian model’s results followed the quantified criteria of ICCs and COVs showed reliable results . The results in JKR or Oliver & Pharr models did not always meet the high quality criteria . The reason for the observed differences may rely on differences between specimens in stickiness under unloading state . For example , in the JKR model , even on the same sample , some spots are sticky , while some single indenta - tions show no adhesion , as shown in Fig . 1E , which would increase the variation between test and retest . Thus , our results show that the hardness of the four organs under study is best calculated using the Hertzian model under forced indentation . Of note , this model has been used by others researchers who utilized the nanoindentation Figure 3 . Renal indentation strategy and Bland – Altman plot .

In addition , comparing the results of the uterus with the three other organs , we found that even in the Hertzian mode , the COV value of the uterus is 11 . 6893 % in the case of calculating the hardness according to Eff and 14 . 1841 % in the case of calculating the stiffness according to E , which were very close to the threshold and much higher than the COV values of the other three organs in the Hertzian model . This indicates that the variability between repeated measurements of the uterus is greater than that of the liver , kidney and spleen . A possible reason is that the uterus is smaller and thinner than the other three organs , and in the course of the experiment , we found that the edge of the smaller and thinner organ uterus was more likely to be rolled up causing a similar situation shown in Supplement 1 Fig 1B , which is expected to affect the results of the measurements . Therefore , the reliability of the method is better in relatively large and thick soft organs ex vivo . Figure 4 . Hepatic indentation strategy and Bland – Altman plot .

When a tissue is manually transformed into a material that can be tested , it is unknown that whether its elasticity keeps the same property as the elasticity of the original organ , and whether part of the elasticity of the organ can represent its overall elasticity . Accordingly , for certain organ studies , in vivo testing may be a better or sometimes even the only option to provide detailed insights into the organ’s mechanical properties . However , in vivo tests are likely interfered and affected by other factors during the measurement process , so perhaps it is an advantage that the nanoindenter can be directly contacted with the target material for measurement . At present , there are more limitations and shortcomings in the application of this technology . For example , its validity and authenticity still need to be further verified , and the standardized routine for biomaterial nanoindentation has Figure 5 .

Kidneys , liver and spleen were dissected from 5 week - , 10 week - , 20 week - and 30 week - old C57BL / 6 N mice . For kidneys and spleen , 2 mice of each sex and age were used . For liver , 2 to 4 mice of each sex and age were used . For uterus , eight mice were used , all these mice were around 100 days old . The experiments were approved by the regulations of local animal care committee ( LAGeSo , Berlin , Germany ) and the animal welfare officers of the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine ( MDC ) ( No . X 9011 / 19 ) . Matrigen hydrogels . Hydrogels with different stiffness ( 1 kPa , 2 kPa , 4 kPa , 8 kPa , 12 kPa and 25 kPa ) were purchased from Softwell , Matrigen , Matrigen Life Technologies , Brea , CA and used for quality control ( 1 kPa , 2 kPa , 4 kPa , 8 kPa , 12 kPa and 25 kPa ; N = 1 to 3 ) . Preparation of tissues . Left and right kidneys were respectively divided into two from the middle line of side ( Fig . 3A ) , the four parts were all taken into indentation . Liver samples were taken from left lobe ( Fig . 4A ) . Spleens were whole harvested for usage in the experiments ( Fig . 5A ) . Left uterus horn was selected and opened ( Fig . 6A , B ) . All organs were cleaned with removal of visible blood , fat , membrane or vessels on the surface of organs , but avoiding damage the parenchyma of them . To obtain a flat surface , we pasted all samples to the bot - tom of 4 cm diameter petri - dishes with Shellac ( Sigma ) so that the outer surface was leveled . Tissue samples were immersed in PBS ( NaCl 0 . 137 M , KCl 0 . 0027 M , Na 2 HPO 4 0 . 01 M , KH 2 PO 4 0 . 0018 M ; pH 7 . 4 ) . Nanoindentation . To determine elastic properties , we used a displacement - controlled nanoindenter instru - ment ( Piuma ; Optics11 , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) . The device utilizes a ferrule - top cantilever probe 32 , 33 to apply load and simultaneously measure indentation depth using a fiber optic based readout ( Fig . 1A ) . We used a spherical probe with a radius of 50 µm and a cantilever stiffness of 0 . 5 N / m . Cantilever bending calibrations were performed before each series of experiments by indenting a rigid surface and equating cantilever bending to probe displacement . Afterwards , the probe was focused on an appropriate area on tissue surface ( Figs . 1B , 3A , 4A , 5A , 6B ) . Each gel was indented 25 times ( 5 × 5 matrix ) in an 800 × 800 μm grid scan with 200 µm distance between measurements . Kidney , liver and spleen samples were indented with 9 indentations ( 3 × 3 matrix ) in a 200 × 200 μm grid scan ( Figs . 3B , 4B , 5B ) . In uterus , three indentation matrixes with 4 single indentations in 100 × 100 μm grid were tested in proximal , middle and distal parts of uterus , respectively ( Fig . 6B , C ) . The applied indentation protocol was composed of a loading phase for 4 s at 8000 nm indentation depth , which was held for one second , and then an unloading phase for 4 s . All scans were done twice for the analysis of reliability . The average of all the results in the four sections from left and right kidneys was presented as renal elasticity . The stiffness of gel , liver and spleen was expressed as the mean value of all results in each scan . Three scans results’ average was taken as uterine hardness . All single indentation values were calculated by Piuma Dataviewer ver - sion 2 . 2 ( Piuma ; Optics11 , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) . Bland – Altman plots and coefficients . Bland – Altman plots ( a graphical method to plot the difference scores of two measurements against the mean for each subject ) 34 , 35 , intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICCs ) and within - subject coefficient of variations ( COVs ) were used to analyze the reliability of test – retest results . If the difference value of test – retest results is between 95 % limits of agreement in the Bland – Altman plots , it means the reliability is good . If the value of ICC is greater than 0 . 8 , there is good reliability between the measurement and re - measurements . If COVs are smaller than 15 % , it is considerable that the test – retest result is reliable . All analyses were performed using SPSS 19 . 0 ( Chicago , USA ) , GraphPad Prism 7 . 0 ( San Diego , USA ) or MedCalc 19 . 3 software ( Belgium ) . Ethics approval and consent to participate . The usage of mice was abided by the regulations of local animal care committee ( LAGeSo , Berlin , Germany ) and the animal welfare officers of the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine ( MDC ) ( No . X 9011 / 16 ) . There are no ethical concerns . Data availability The data and protocol can be obtained by contacting Michael Gotthardt .
