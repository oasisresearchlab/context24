A RT I C L E S Integrin endosomal signalling suppresses anoikis Jonna Alanko 1 , 2 , Anja Mai 1 , Guillaume Jacquemet 1 , Kristine Schauer 3 , Riina Kaukonen 1 , Markku Saari 1 , 2 , Bruno Goud 3 and Johanna Ivaska 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 Integrin - containing focal adhesions transmit extracellular signals across the plasma membrane to modulate cell adhesion , signalling and survival . Although integrins are known to undergo continuous endo / exocytic trafﬁc , the potential impact of endocytic trafﬁc on integrin - induced signals is unknown . Here , we demonstrate that integrin signalling is not restricted to cell – ECM adhesions and identify an endosomal signalling platform that supports integrin signalling away from the plasma membrane . We show that active focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , an established marker of integrin – ECM downstream signalling , localizes with active integrins on endosomes . Integrin endocytosis positively regulates adhesion - induced FAK activation , which is early endosome antigen - 1 and small GTPase Rab21 dependent . FAK binds directly to puriﬁed endosomes and becomes activated on them , suggesting a role for endocytosis in enhancing distinct integrin downstream signalling events . Finally , endosomal integrin signalling contributes to cancer - related processes such as anoikis resistance , anchorage independence and metastasis . Integrins are heterodimeric cell - surface adhesion receptors functioning as integrators of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) - driven cues , the cellular cytoskeleton and the cellular signalling apparatus 1 . On adhesion , integrins trigger the formation of plasma membrane - proximal large mechanosensing and signal - transmitting protein clusters depicted as ‘adhesomes’ 2 , 3 . In addition , integrins undergo constant endocytic traﬃc to facilitate focal adhesion turnover , cell migration , invasion and cytokinesis 4 . For other receptor systems it is well established that endocytic membrane traﬃc regulates bioavailability of cell - surface molecules and therefore the intensity and / or specificity of receptor - initiated signals 5 , 6 . Although active integrins and their ligands have been detected in endosomes 7 – 9 and increased integrin recycling to the plasma membrane contributes to enhanced signalling of co - traﬃcked receptor tyrosine kinases 10 , 11 it has remained unclear whether endocytosed active integrins signal in endosomes . Here , we demonstrate that integrin signalling is not restricted to focal adhesions as previously described and that endocytosis is necessary for full ECM - induced , integrin - mediated ERK , AKT and FAK signalling . We find that FAK binds directly to and can become activated on purified endosomes . Moreover , the FERM domain of FAK is able to bind purified integrin - containing endosomes , suggesting the potential for integrin - signalling complexes to assemble on endosomes after internalization of active integrins . Importantly , FAK is required for anchorage - independent growth and suppression of anoikis 12 . Integrin endosomal signalling correlates with reduced anoikis sensitivity in normal cells and anchorage - independent growth and metastasis in breast cancer cells . RESULTS Active FAK localizes to integrin - containing endosomes Cell – ECM adhesion and activation of integrin signalling is necessary for cell survival , diﬀerentiation and developmental processes 13 , 14 . Integrin endocytosis oﬀers an eﬃcient system to control integrin heterodimer availability at the cell surface and thus the specific ECM - induced cellular response during processes such as cell migration and tumour cell invasion 15 , 16 . As FAK recruitment to focal adhesions and subsequent Tyr 397 autophosphorylation ( pFAK - Y397 ) is an established marker of integrin – ECM engagement and downstream signalling 17 we used an anti - pFAK - Y397 antibody to visualize integrin signalling and subcellular localization in adherent cells . The pFAK - Y397 antibody detected a dominant protein band with a relative molecular mass of 125 , 000 in wild - type Fak + / + mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) that was absent in Fak − / − cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) and strongly reduced on treatment with FAK inhibitors in western blots and in immunofluorescence ( Supplementary Fig . 1b , c ) indicative of antibody specificity towards pFAK - Y397 . Immunofluorescence analyses of cells plated on micropatterns revealed that in addition to the expected ECM - interface localization of integrin and pFAK , substantial pools of both proteins could be detected within the cell body ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ) .

Mann – Whitney test P values are provided . three - dimensional probabilistic density maps 18 of active integrin and pFAK , in which density contours represent the smallest intracellular volume containing 50 % of the total immunofluorescence signal , indicated a substantial pool of pFAK at the cell centre where it overlapped with internalized active β 1 - integrin ( 9EG7 antibody ; Fig . 1a ) . The extent of co - localization between active β 1 - integrin and pFAK in micropattern - normalized cells ( n = 24 ) was 38 . 3 ± 6 . 2 ( s . d . ) % , as assessed by a particle - based analysis . A similar intracellular localization of pFAK was detected in unconstrained cells ( Fig . 1b ) , suggesting that the non - adhesion - site - localized pFAK was not an artefact of restricting the cell geometry with micropatterns . Exogenous expression of the constitutively active Rab5 GTPase ( Rab5Q79L , Rab5 - CA ) results in the formation of enlarged endosome structures 19 and can be used to visualize endosomal localization of a variety of proteins , including integrins 20 . In addition , overexpression of Rab21 induces β 1 - integrin endocytosis and localization to enlarged early endosomes 9 . We used these properties to further investigate the subcellular localization of the intracellular active β 1 - integrin and pFAK . Active β 1 - integrin ( 12G10 antibody ) and pFAK were visible as closely associated puncta in both Rab5 - CA - and Rab21 - positive endo - somes in serum - starved telomerase - immortalized foreskin fibroblasts ( TIFFs ) actively adhering to fibronectin ( Fig . 1c , Rab5CA ; 98 . 7 % and SupplementaryFig . 1e , Rab21 ; 97 . 1 % ofactive β 1 - integrin - positiveen - dosomes contained pFAK , n = 243 and 209 endosomes , respectively ) and similar data were obtained using a total β 1 - integrin antibody ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Fig . 1e ) . Endosomal puncta of active β 1 - integrin and pFAK closely associated with a mean distance of ∼ 2 – 3 pixels , a value similar to those obtained between active β 1 - integrin and Rab5 ( mean distance of ∼ 3 pixels ; Fig . 1c ) . Similar as - sociation between active β 1 - integrin and pFAK was observed on early NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 17 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2015 1413 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Unprocessed original scans of blots are shown in Supplementary Fig . 9 . endosome antigen - 1 ( EEA1 ) - ( Fig . 1b ) and Rab21 - positive endosomes ( Supplementary Fig . 1e ) . For comparison , the mean distance between randomly distributed non - endosomal pFAK and pFAK ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Fig . 1e ) or active β 1 - integrin and pFAK outside the endosomes ( Fig . 1b ) was ∼ 8 – 10 pixels . These puncta co - distribution analyses 21 indicate that active β 1 - integrin and pFAK are found in the same endosomes . Phospho - FAK recruitment to integrin - positive endosomes was further confirmed using super - resolution stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) microscopy ( Fig . 1d ) . Thus , phosphory - lated FAK is not restricted to focal adhesions but can also be detected on endosomes in adherent cells . Integrin ligands and talin are present in FAK - positive endosomes Several studies report integrin ligand localization in endosomes 8 , 10 , 22 and we have demonstrated increased endosomal retention of active β 1 - integrins compared with inactive receptors 7 . Importantly , we detected the integrin ligand fibronectin in pFAK and active β 1 - integrin - positive endosomes ( Fig . 2a ; 90 . 5 % of pFAK - positive endosomes contained fibronectin , n = 200 endosomes ) , suggesting that functional receptor – ligand coupling is linked to the endosome - associated active FAK pool . Biochemical fractionations separating plasma membrane , cytoplasm and endomembrane compartments 23 demonstrated the presence of FAK in EEA1 , Rab21 and β 1 - integrin - positive endosomal fractions ( Fig . 2b ) . Interestingly , corresponding to the presence of active integrin receptors in endosomes , the integrin activator and focal adhesion component talin , but not paxillin and only very low levels of vinculin , was also detected in endosomes suggesting the recruitment of a specific subset of integrin adhesome proteins to endosomes . Endocytosis contributes to integrin signalling Next , we setout toinvestigatewhether theendosome - associated active integrin and FAK are crucial components of integrin – ECM - induced signalling . Serum - starved cells were maintained in suspension for 1h ( to inactivate RTKs and adhesion - induced pathways ) and subsequently plated on integrin ligands . Under these conditions , ECM engagement induced time - dependent activation of the canonical downstream integrin - signalling mediators including FAK , ERK1 / 2 and Akt without significant adhesion - dependent activation of any of the 48 diﬀerent RTKs tested ( Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) , suggesting that the observed signals were a consequence of integrin - mediated adhesionandnotduetogrowthfactorreceptorstimulation . Dynasore - mediated inhibition of dynamin 24 , an important mediator of integrin receptor endocytosis 16 , abrogated integrin and transferrin receptor internalization ( Supplementary Fig . 3a – c ) and significantly attenuated the activation of FAK and ERK1 / 2 in carcinoma cells and in normal fibroblasts spreading on collagen or fibronectin ( Fig . 3a – d and Supplementary Fig . 4a – d ) suggesting that endocytosis was key for adhesion - induced signalling . These results were recapitulated with anotherdynamininhibitorDyngo4 ( ref . 25 ) andadynamindominant - negative construct ( dynamin - 2 K44A – GFP ; ref . 26 ; Supplementary Fig . 4e , f ) . Interestingly , notallintegrin - mediatedpathways , suchasSrc activation , were consistently inhibited on defective dynamin function ( Fig . 3a – d and Supplementary Fig . 4a – d ) . This may be attributed to increased integrin plasma membrane signalling supported by the slightly elevated cell - surface β 1 - integrin levels in dynamin - inhibited cells ( Supplementary Fig . 4g ) . In line with these data , dynamin inhibition triggered a reduction in the in situ proximity ligation assay ( PLA ) signal between integrin and pFAK specifically in endosomes and promoted a converse increase in the plasma membrane - localized 1414 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 17 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2015 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

RNA interference ( RNAi ) - mediated silencing of Rab21 ( ref . 27 ) significantly reduced FAK phosphorylation ( Fig . 3f ) on matrix engagement corresponding with decreased integrin endocytosis observed in Rab21 - depleted cells 9 . Furthermore , adhesion - induced signalling ( pFAK levels ) was signif - icantly impaired in cells expressing an endocytosis - defective collagen - binding integrin ( α 2 - subunit KR1160 / 61AA mutation as compared with wild - type α 2 - integrin receptor - expressing cells adhering to colla - gen 28 ( Fig . 3g ) . Taken together , these data demonstrate that impaired integrin endocytosis attenuates adhesion - induced FAK activation . FAK is recruited to and activated on puriﬁed endosomes The requirement for endocytosis for enhanced integrin signalling could be linked to sustained signalling of plasma membrane - initiated signalling on the endosomes or the ability of integrins to trigger signalling from endomembranes . To study this further we isolated endosomes from Fak + / + and Fak − / − MEFs . β 1 - integrin localized to endosomal and plasma membrane fractions in both cell types indicating that integrin endosomal localization is not FAK dependent ( Fig . 4a ) . As we found that endosomes contain a subset of integrin - signalling components ( Fig . 2b ) we next addressed the possibility that these components could assemble directly on the endosome . 1416 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 17 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2015 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Strikingly , soluble FAK was specifically recruited to the endosomes , independently of its phosphorylation status ( Fig . 4b ) . Integrins contribute to this recruitment because silencing of β 1 - integrins reduced the amount of recruited active FAK ( Fig . 4c and Supplementary Fig . 4i ) . Finally , the non - phosphorylated recombinant FAK became phosphorylated on Tyr 397 on the isolated endosomes in vitro ( Fig . 4d ) , suggesting NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 17 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2015 1417 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Unprocessed original scans of blots are shown in Supplementary Fig . 9 . the possibility that internalized integrins could assemble endosomal signalling complexes distinct from the plasma membrane - localized adhesions . This notion was further supported by the observation that exogenous focal adhesion targeting domain of FAK alone ( FAK FAT ) was unable to localize to the endosomal fraction whereas the endogenous FAK and the FERM domain of FAK ( FAK FERM ) localized to the endosomal fraction ( Fig . 4e ) . Taken together , these data suggest a role for endocytosis in enhancing and possibly triggering distinct integrin downstream signalling events , including FAK activation . Integrin endocytosis is intimately coupled to the cellular cytoskeleton and cell spreading . In line with this , we observed slightly reduced cell spreading in dynasore - treated cells after 45min of adhesion to collagen ( Supplementary Fig . 5a , b ) . To exclude the possibility that attenuated adhesion signalling , on inhibition of integrin endocytosis , was secondary to alterations in adhesion area , we induced integrin – ECM ligation in suspension using small collagen - coated beads . Dynasore treatment significantly inhibited FAK activation on cell binding to collagen beads ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) , indicative of a cell spreading - independent regulatory role for endocytosis in ECM - induced integrin signalling . In addition , we found that cell adhesion to round micropatterns with restricted dimensions that constrain cell spreading supported FAK activation in an endocytosis - dependent manner ( Fig . 4f ) . Integrin and FAK - proximal proteins on endosomes To gain further insight into the integrin and FAK signalling networks on the endomembranes we carried out mass spectrometric analyses of the cytoplasmic , plasma membrane and endosomal fractions of fibroblasts ( Fig . 5a – d and Supplementary Table 1 ) . Importantly , the integrin ligands fibronectin and collagen as well as many established endomembrane proteins , in addition to classic endosome markers , EHD1 , Rab14 and rabaptin - 5 , were detected in the endosomal fraction ( Fig . 5bandSupplementaryTable1 ) . Interestingly , 69proteins identified in the endosomal fraction are components of the literature - curated map of adhesion complexes 29 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) and many more endosome fraction proteins were identified as adhesion components in several published mass spectrometric data sets 1418 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 17 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2015 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Statistics source data can be found in Supplementary Table 2 . ( SupplementaryTable1andMethodsfordetails ) . Tohighlightputative regulators of FAK or β 1 - integrin on endosomes , proteins identified in the endosomal fraction were mapped onto a human protein – protein interaction network and sub - networks containing FAK ( Fig . 5c ) and β 1 - integrin ( Fig . 5d ) binders were created . The proteins in both networks have very interesting activities that are likely to contribute to integrin signalling and maintenance of receptor activity . These included actin - binding proteins , scaﬀolding proteins , integrin activity regulators ( for example , talin ) , phosphatases known to contribute to signalling and several guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) implicated in the regulation of the small GTPases Rac and Rho . Interestingly , Src and paxillin , both important components of FAK signalling in focal adhesions , were not abundant in the endomembrane fraction ( compared with the plasma membrane or cytosolic fractions ; Fig . 5b ) . These data suggest that integrin signalling on endosomes may involve unique features not present in integrin signalling in focal adhesions . Integrin endosomal signalling is EEA1 dependent We next investigated whether increased integrin traﬃc could augment signalling . Transient overexpression of Rab5 - CA and Rab21 , previously reported to increase integrin endocytosis in multiple cell types 9 , 28 , 30 , significantly promoted adhesion - dependent FAK activation ( Supplementary Fig . 6a , b ) . Active β 1 - integrin and pFAK are present on endosomes positive for endogenous EEA1 , a key Rab5 eﬀector 31 , 32 , associated with both Rab5 - and Rab21 - positive endosomes 4 ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Fig . 1e ) and EEA1 and pFAK localize to GFP – EEA1 - positive endosomes in fibroblasts adhering to fibronectin ( Supplementary Fig . 6c ) . Although multiple endosomal signalling pathways are EEA1 dependent , a second class of Rab5 - positive , EEA1 - negative early endosomes containing one or both of the closely related APPL1 and APPL2 adaptors have also been implicated in signalling 33 – 35 . Silencing of EEA1 with a single siRNA oligonucleotide ( Fig . 6a ) or an independent siRNA smart pool ( Supplementary Fig . 6d ) significantly reduced adhesion - induced NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 17 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2015 1419 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

The full activation of the ECM - induced integrin pFAK - Y397 signal is dependent on Rab21 - mediated integrin endocytosis to EEA1 - containing early endosomes , and this is ultimately required for suppression of anoikis and anchorage - independent growth . Blocked integrin endocytosis leads to reduced FAK activation and to increased anoikis sensitivity . FAK activation ( Fig . 6a ) without influencing integrin endocytosis ( Fig . 6b ) . In contrast , silencing of APPL1 had no eﬀect on integrin signalling or endocytosis in response to adhesion ( Fig . 6b , c ) . The recruitment of EEA1 to endosomes requires the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PI ( 3 ) P ) and inhibition of phosphoinositide - 3 - phosphate kinase ( PI ( 3 ) K ) has been shown to decrease the number of EEA1 - containing endosomes while increasing the size of APPL1 - positive vesicles 36 . Accordingly , treatment of cells with a PI ( 3 ) K inhibitor triggered a reduction in the number of EEA1 - positive endosomes without reducing total EEA1 levels and inhibited adhesion - induced FAK activation similarly to dynasore treatment ( Fig . 6d , e ) . Taken together , our results reveal an important role for EEA1 but not APPL1 in integrin endosomal signalling . Integrin endosomal signalling inhibits anoikis A central function for integrin - induced signalling is adhesion - dependent cell survival . On detachment , normal cells undergo a specialized form of programmed cell death called anoikis , and canonical integrin - mediated activation of FAK on the plasma membrane has been considered critical for anoikis suppression 12 . On detachment , serum - starved fibroblasts exhibited relatively fast anoikis and inhibition of integrin endocytosis with dynasore or Dyngo4a significantly increased the fraction of apoptotic cells 5h post detachment but had no eﬀect on cell survival in adherent cells ( Fig . 7a and Supplementary Fig . 7a ) . Importantly , dynasore treatment reduced pFAK and induced anoikis sensitivity in Fak + / + MEFs in suspension to levels seen in Fak − / − MEFs under the same experimental condition ; however , dynamin inhibition did not further increase apoptosis in Fak − / − MEFs ( Fig . 7b ) , indicative of a link between FAK activation and sensitivity to dynasore - induced anoikis . Finally , because EEA1 endosomes ( but not APPL endosomes ) and Rab21 - mediated endocy - tosiswereidentifiedascriticalcontributorstointegrinendosomalFAK signalling ( Figs 3h and 2f ) , we tested the eﬀect of EEA1 , APPL - 1 and Rab21 silencing on anoikis sensitivity . RNAi transfections increased the proportion of apoptotic cells to some extent in all siRNA - transfected adherent cells ( Fig . 4d , e ) . However , on cell detachment EEA1 - and Rab21 - silenced cells showed significantly higher anoikis sensitivity and reduced pFAK levels ( Figs 7c , d , 6a and 3f ) , whereas APPL1silencingdidnotsignificantlyincreaseanoikis ( Supplementary Fig . 7b ) . Next we tested whether impairment of integrin signalling from endosomes negatively aﬀects the ability of anoikis - resistant cells to grow in an anchorage - independent manner , which is a critical hallmark of cancer . We found that anchorage - independent growth of tumorigenic MDA - MB - 231 cells was sensitive to FAK and dynamin inhibition ( Supplementary Fig . 8a ) , suggesting the suitability of these cells for investigation of the functional contribution of endosomal FAK signalling . In vitro , silencing of EEA1 and even more significantly silencing of Rab21 reduced the proportion of live cells in suspension cultures ( Fig . 7e ) . As anchorage - independent growth has been linked to metastasis 37 , we investigated the ability of MDA - MB - 231 cells to survive in vasculature and metastasize to lungs . When control and Rab21 siRNA - or control and EEA1 siRNA - transfected cells were co - injected into the same recipient animals , the number of extravasated Rab21 - silenced cells in the lung tissue was significantly lower after 48h ( Fig . 7f , g and Supplementary Fig . 8b ) . Thus , impaired integrin endosomal signalling sensitizes cancer cells to detachment - induced cell death and impairs their metastatic potential in vivo . DISCUSSION Our study provides evidence , using multiple complementary approaches , for non - canonical β 1 - integrin signalling that is distinct from the signalling role of integrins in adhesion sites at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 8 ) . Our data indicate that active integrins bound to their ligands co - localize with active FAK in endosomes away from the plasma membrane . Integrin - positive endosomes contain talin , which may function to keep the integrin active . In addition , several other signalling and scaﬀolding proteins are detected in the isolated endosomal fraction and their functional contribution to integrin endosomal signalling will be interesting to investigate in detail in the future . We find that integrin - containing endosomes harbour the capacity to recruit and activate soluble FAK suggesting that a subset of integrin - associated proteins , present in cell – ECM adhesions , may form the core integrin - signalling platform in endosomes . It is also possible that active phosphorylated FAK is co - endocytosed with integrin receptors from the plasma membrane and that additional pFAK recruitment to the endosome acts to reinforce signalling 1420 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 17 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2015 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved A RT I C L E S downstream of integrin – ECM engagement . Diﬀerentiating between these two distinct mechanisms , co - endocytosis or reassembly of integrin - signalling complexes at the endosome , will be crucial for our understanding of integrin endosomal signalling and will require further comprehensive investigation . Nevertheless , integrin signalling from EEA1 endosomes , revealed in this study , functions to accentuate adhesion - induced signalling and facilitates extended survival in anoikis - sensitive cells . Interestingly , the targeting of FAK to endosomes seems to be distinct from its focal adhesion recruitment 38 . The FAT sequence in FAK is suﬃcient alone to localize to focal adhesions in cells ; however , we find that localization to the endosomes is mediated by the FAK FERM domain and not the FAT domain . Furthermore , Src , which is a critical enhancer of FAK activity and its downstream signalling in focal adhesions 39 , is only very weakly detectable in the integrin - containing endosomal fractions . Thus , targeting and activation of FAK on endosomes may be mechanistically distinct from its regulation in focal adhesions . We show here that endosome - localized active integrin and FAK signalling contribute to cancer - related processes such as anchorage - independent growth and metastasis . In the future , unravelling mechanisms involved in the endosomal activation of FAK in non - adherent cells may uncover possible therapeutic targets in anoikis - resistant transformed cells .

Adherent , serum - starved cells were treated with 80 µ M dynasore , 3 or 10 µ M Dyngo4a or equivalent amounts of DMSO for 1h at + 37 ◦ C . Cells were maintained at + 37 ◦ C for 5h or detached with HyQTase , washed and suspended in 5ml of serum - free medium containing the same concentrations of dynasore or Dyngo4a and kept in suspension for 5h at + 37 ◦ C . Adherent cells were collected with HyQTase and all cells were then analysed for caspase - 3 / 7 positivity using the Nucview Apoptosis Assay according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( Essen Bioscience ) . Immunofluorescence , microscopy , image and co - distribution analysis . Cells platedonIbididishes ( IntegratedBiodiagnostics ) oronacid - washedcoverslipswere fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) containing 1mm MgCl 2 for 15min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 in 30 % horse serum / TBS for 15min at room temperature . Samples were blocked and antibodies were diluted in 30 % horse serum / TBS . Primary antibodies were used at predetermined concentrations ( 5 – 10 µ gml − 1 ) and AlexaFluor secondary antibodies as 5 µ gml − 1 . Unless otherwise stated , all images were acquired using the spinning - disc confocal microscope as described previously 7 with the exception of a 100 × / 1 . 3 Oil ( Pha3 , EC Plan Neofluar ) objective being used . The microscope , image acquisition and related data analysis for the crossbow - shaped micropatterns are described in ref . 18 . Quantitative analysis for all other images was performed using NIH ImageJ ( 1 . 45s ) . Followingbackgroundsubtraction , β 1 - integrinand555 - Trfendocytosiswas calculated from mid - slices by measuring the integrated density within the cell as a percentageofthetotalintegrateddensity ( integrinendocytosis ) orbymeasuringthe mean intensity of the cell ( Trf endocytosis ) . A Leica TCS SP5 stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) laser scanning microscope was used to acquire images at the super - resolution level ( Leica Microsystems GmbH ) , where approximately 65nm resolution in the x , y axis was achieved . A Leica STED infrared - corrected objective NATURE CELL BIOLOGY © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncb3250 M E T H O D S 100 × / 1 . 4 was used . Mega - 520 fluorophore was excited at 532nm wavelength ( PicoQuant ) and Star - 635 at 635nm wavelength ( PicoQuant ) . The channels were scanned sequentially and emission was detected by avalanche photodiode detectors at the emission range of 685 / 40 ( Leica Microsystems GmbH ) . Leica LAS software ( Leica Microsystems GmabH ) was used to perform background subtraction and deconvolution in all images . In the deconvolution process a Lorentzian point spread function ( PSF ) was generated by using the measured PSF value of 62nm , which was exploited to signal energy based deconvolution algorithm . Deconvolution was done by using the deconvolution tool box included in Leica LAS imaging software . GFP – Rab5 - CAwasimagedwithconfocalresolution , byusinga488nmlaserlinefor excitation , and emission was detected at 500 – 530nm . In the deconvolution process a Gaussian PSF was generated for the confocal channel by using the measured PSF value of 230nm , which was exploited to signal energy based deconvolution algorithm . STEDimagingwasperformedattheLaboratoryofBiophysics , University of Turku . Image co - localization analysis was performed by using the Intensity Correlation Analysis plugin for ImageJ to create PDM ( product of the diﬀerences from the mean ) images , where PDM = ( red intensity − mean red intensity ) × ( green intensity − mean green intensity ) . Analysis of co - distribution between active β 1 - integrin and pFAK puncta on microdomains of either Rab5 - , Rab21 - or EEA1 - positive endosomes was performed as described in ref . 15 . The distance between pFAK and FAK was measured by selecting a random non - endosomal pFAK puncta and measuring the distance to the closest neighbour pFAK puncta .

Cellswereseededonmicropatternsinserum - free medium for either 3h or 45min ( cells on spots ) before fixing . Samples were stained as described above . The microscope , image acquisition and creation of the probabilistic density maps are described in ref . 18 . Mice . Eight - week - old female Hsd : Athymic Nude – Foxn1nu mice were used for animal experiments . Studies were performed under a valid animal licence ( licence number 4199 / 04 . 10 . 07 / 2014 ) and conducted according to the Finnish act on animal experimentation guidelines . Lung extravasation . Control and Rab21 or EEA1 siRNA - transfected MDA - MB - 231 cells were labelled with live - cell dyes ( Ctrl siRNA : Far - red DDAO - SE ; Rab21 siRNA / EEA1 siRNA : green CMFDA ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Control siRNA - and Rab21 siRNA / EEA1 siRNA - treated cells ( 0 . 75 – 1 × 10 6 cells each ) wereinjectedina1 : 1ratiointothetailveinof15miceandlungswerecollected 48h after injection . This animal number has previously been suﬃcient for statistical significance in a similar experimental set - up 48 , 49 . The left lung of each mouse was formalin fixed and processed for frozen sections to be analysed by fluorescence microscopy and right lungs were processed into a cell suspension by collagenase I treatment as described in refs 48 , 49 and the number of fluorescently labelled cells was analysed by flow cytometry using LSRFortessa from BD Biosciences . The analyses were blinded such that the investigator analysing the data was unaware of theidentityofthelabelledcellpopulations .

Noblindingor randomizationwasperformedasbothcelltypesareco - injectedinthesamerecipient animals simultaneously and analysed from the same samples using flow cytometry . Mass spectrometry . Protein samples obtained from subcellular fractionation of WT MEFs were separated by SDS – PAGE and allowed to migrate 20mm into a 4 – 12 % polyacrylamide gel . Following staining with InstantBlue ( Expedeon ) , gel laneswereslicedintoten2 - mmbandsandsubjectedtoin - geldigestionwithtrypsin as described previously 50 with modifications . Tryptic peptides were evaporated to dryness , dissolved in 1 % HCOOH and 5 µ l was submitted to LC – MS / MS analysis . The LC – MS / MS analysis was performed on a nanoflow HPLC system ( EasyNano , ThermoFisherScientific ) coupledtotheLTQOrbitrapVelosPromassspectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ionization source . Peptides were first loaded on a trapping column and subsequently separated inline on a 15cm C 18 column ( 75 µ m × 15cm , Magic 5 µ m 200Å C 18 , Michrom BioResources ) . The mobile phase consisted of water / acetonitrile ( 98 : 2 ( v / v ) ) with 0 . 2 % formicacid ( solventA ) oracetonitrile / water ( 95 : 5 ( v / v ) ) with0 . 2 % formicacid ( solvent B ) . A linear 50min gradient from 5 % to 35 % B was used to elute peptides . MS data were acquired automatically using Thermo Xcalibur software ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . An information - dependent acquisition method consisted of a TOF MS survey scan of mass range 300 – 2 , 000 m / z . The data files were searched for protein identification using Proteome Discoverer ( 1 . 4 ) connected to in - house Mascot ( v . 2 . 4 ) software . Data were searched against the SwissProt database ( release 2014 _ 08 ) . Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine was allowed as a variable modification . Only tryptic peptides were considered , with up to one missed cleavage permitted . Monoisotopic precursor mass values were used , and only doubly and triply charged precursor ions were considered . Data were validated in Scaﬀold ( version 3 . 6 ) using a threshold of identification of at least 50 % probability at the peptide level , at least 99 % probability at the protein level and assignment of at least two unique , validated peptides . These acceptance criteria resulted in an estimated protein false discovery rate of 0 . 1 % for all data sets . Data were converted using PRIDE Converter 2 ( ref . 51 ) , validated using PRIDE Inspector ( version 2 . 5 ; ref . 52 ) . Details of all identified proteins are provided in Supplementary Table 1 . Proteins identified in the various cellular fractions and described to be components of the Geiger Adhesome 29 were hierarchically clustered on the basis of uncentred Pearson correlation using Cluster 3 . 0 ( C Clustering Library , version 1 . 50 ; ref . 53 ) and visualized using Java TreeView ( version 1 . 1 . 6r2 ; ref . 54 ) . Protein – protein interaction ( PPI ) network analysis was performed using Cytoscape ( version 3 . 2 ; ref . 55 ) . Proteins were mapped onto a merged human interactome consisting of PPIs reported in the Protein Interaction Network Analysis platform Homo sapiens network ( May 2014 ) 56 . Identified proteins were also compared to the proteins identified in various published data set of isolated adhesion complexes 57 – 61 . Accession numbers .
