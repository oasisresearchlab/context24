We report here that the The establishment and maintenance of cell polarity is an essential feature of all eukaryotic cells , both during localized activation of integrins at the front of the cell initiates a signal transduction pathway , leading to the development and in the adult .

The genetic analysis of the budding yeast , S . cerevis - Results iae , has revealed that the small GTPase Cdc42 is an essential regulator of cell polarity ( Johnson and Pringle , Characteristics of Astrocyte Migration 1990 ) . Cdc42 has also been shown to regulate polarity during Wound Healing in mammalian cells .

Although the nucleus ( Figure 4C , panel c , white angles ) , and ( 2 ) GFP - Cdc42 fluorescence was also enhanced at the very PKC (cid:1) activity was not required for the formation of pro - trusions , inhibition of PKC ( with GF 109203X ) did lead to tip of the protrusion , apparently associated with the plasma membrane at the leading edge ( Figure 4C , panel abnormal protrusions ( Figure 3C ) .

All results are representative of ported by others ( data not shown ) ( Joberty et al . , 2000 ; 3 independent experiments . Lin et al . , 2000 ) . Furthermore , expression of L61Cdc42 , FGD - 1 ( a Cdc42 exchange factor ) , or full - length mPar6C led to an increase in the activity of endogenous aPKCs Cell494 To determine which proteins are tyrosine - phosphory - lated upon astrocyte wounding , cells were visualized by immunofluorescence using an anti - phosphotyrosine antibody . Increased staining at the leading edge of the cells could be seen , which first formed as a dotted pat - tern ( Figure 7A , upright panel ) and later matured into dashed structures reminiscent of focal adhesions ( Fig - ure 7A , 4 h ) . This increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was abolished by PP1 or PP2 treatment ( Figure 7A ) . Western blots showed a strong increase in total tyrosine phosphorylated proteins during the first hour following wounding ( data not shown ) , and immunoprecipitations revealed that the typical focal - adhesion associated pro - teins , FAK , paxillin , and p130 Cas were strongly phosphor - ylated ( Figure 7B ) . Finally , given these results , the potential role of integ - rins in initiating astrocyte polarization was examined . Integrin function was blocked using a cyclic RGD pep - tide , added immediately before wounding . The peptide completely abolished Cdc42 and aPKC activation ( Fig - ure 7C ) and as a consequence inhibited MTOC polariza - tion ( Figure 7D ) , Golgi reorientation ( data not shown ) , and protrusion formation ( data not shown ) .

These results microtubule system , totally inhibited protrusion forma - suggest that the interaction of Cdc42 with mPar6 leads tion . These results suggest that microtubule dynamics , to activation of an associated aPKC . We conclude that and not actin dynamics , provides the driving force for Cdc42 activation mediates wound - induced aPKC acti - elongation at the leading edge . We previously reported vation . that the microtubule cytoskeleton did not play a signifi - cant role in the migration of primary rat embryo fibro - blasts in a similar wound - induced assay , whereas in Integrin Activation Is Required for Cell Polarization neuronal cells , microtubules are known to be required for axon elongation ( Nobes and Hall , 1999 ; Tanaka et To identify the polarity signals that initiate Cdc42 activa - tion , we tested a wide range of inhibitors for their ability al . , 1995 ) . Clearly , the microtubule cytoskeleton makes different contributions to cell migration in different cell to prevent MTOC polarization and protrusion formation . Of the inhibitors tested , only PP1 and PP2 , two relatively types . A role for the three Rho GTPases , Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 specific inhibitorsof Src - liketyrosine kinases , perturbed MTOC polarization ( Figure 6A ) , protrusion formation in controlling the organization of the actin cytoskeleton is well established in many different cell types ( Hall , ( Figure 6B ) , as well as Golgi reorientation ( data not shown ) . In contrast , neither PP3 , an inactive analog of 1998 ) . However , there is growing evidence that they can also influence the microtubule cytoskeleton . Rho , for PP2 , nor the EGF - receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG 1478 had any effect . Pretreatment of astrocytes with example , leads to the stabilization of microtubules ( as visualized with antibodies to detyrosinated tubulin ) in PP1 and PP2 abolished both Cdc42 ( Figure 6C ) and aPKC activation ( data not shown ) . the direction of migration ( Cook et al . , 1998 ; Ishizaki Cdc42 Controls Cell Polarity 495 Figure 7 .

A number of other PAR gene products have been shown to be essential in establishing polarity microtubules in protrusions after wounding ( unpub - lished data ) , suggesting that Rho might affect the micro - in the C . elegans embryo , including a PDZ - containing protein , PAR3 , that binds directly to the PDZ domain of tubule cytoskeleton during astrocyte migration . How - ever , Rho is not required for MTOC polarization or for PAR6 . The mammalian homolog of PAR3 , together with aPKCs , has recently been reported as essential for the formation of protrusions . We show here that Rac is es - sential for the microtubule - dependent formation of pro - establishment of epithelial junctional structures ( Suzuki et al . , 2001 ) . However , overexpression of the mPar6C trusions in migrating astrocytes . It appears , therefore , that Rac mediates cell elongation either by directly af - PDZ domain did not dramatically affect polarity of the migrating astrocytes ; moreover , endogenous Par3 did fectingmicrotubuledynamicsorbyregulatinganactivity that isdependent on microtubule dynamics . We recently not localize at the leading edge , but rather at cell - cell contacts ( data not shown ) . reported that Rac , via p65PAK , can potentially regulate microtubule dynamics through phosphorylation and in - Our data also show that Cdc42 is essential for the formation of protrusions leading to the elongated mor - hibition of the microtubule - destabilizing protein stath - min ( Daub et al . , 2001 ) . We are currently investigating phology , though only at early times after wounding . Rac , on the other hand , is essential for both the development whether stathmin phosphorylation is involved . Theresultswepresenthere nowprovideamechanism and the maintenance of protrusions during migration . Interestingly , Cdc42 - mediated initiation of protrusions through which Cdc42 regulates the microtubule - depen - dent establishment of cell polarity . We have shown that is independent of mPar6 and PKC (cid:1) . We think that the most likely explanation for this is that at early times , the Cdc42 target protein , mPar6 , and its associated protein , PKC (cid:1) , are essential for defining cell polarity as Cdc42 is required to activate Rac in a cascade as pre - viously described ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ; Price et al . , determined by the reorientation of the MTOC and the Golgi to face the wound edge and by the direction of 1998 ) . At later times , Rac recruitment , perhaps by integ - rin complexes , and activation at the leading edge be - cell elongation . mPar6 is the mammalian ortholog of the C . elegans PAR6 protein .

It seems likely that sup - pression of MTOC reorientation leads to mislocalized show that mPar6C and PKC (cid:1) are involved in a signaling pathway directly responsible for the establishment of targeting of proteins required for the formation of the protrusion . Our results indicate that Cdc42 coordinately polarity during migration of mammalian cells . Further - more , we show that the kinase activity of PKC (cid:1) is essen - controls two distinct pathways : one , involving PKC (cid:1) , is Cell496 essential for MTOC polarization , and the other , involving by the interaction of the GTPase with a membrane - Rac , is essential for the formation of protrusions .

In agreement with this , we have found that consequences of this are that inhibition of PKC (cid:1) blocks complete disruption of the microtubule cytoskeleton MTOC polarization but has no effect on protrusion for - with high concentration ( 10 (cid:2) M ) of nocodazole blocks mation , while inhibition of Rac blocks protrusion but has activation of Cdc42 and its localization to the leading no effect on MTOC polarization . edge ( data not shown ) . Recent reports have shown that GTP - bound Cdc42 Finally , we show that activation of Cdc42 is mediated can bind to mPar6 in vitro as well as in vivo using overex - by integrin signaling , perhaps involving a Src - like tyro - pressing transfected cells ( Joberty et al . , 2000 ; Lin et sine kinase . The Scr family kinases Fyn and Src are al . , 2000 ; Qiu et al . , 2000 ) . Here , we show that Cdc42 closely associated with integrins and can be activated activation leads to the recruitment of mPar6C and PKC (cid:1) downstream of integrin activation ( Cobb et al . , 1994 ; to the plasma membrane , specifically at the leading Wary et al . , 1998 ) . A number of previous observations edge , and to activation of PKC (cid:1) . The target of PKC (cid:1) have shown that Rho GTPases can be activated upon phosphorylation is unknown , but one of the obvious integrin engagement ( Cox et al . , 2001 ; Ren et al . , 1999 ) . candidates is themicrotubule - based dynein motor com - However , not all integrins lead to Cdc42 activation , and plex . We have shown that dynein function is required therefore not all would be expected to participate in for MTOC polarization , but not for protrusion formation polarity establishment ( Caron and Hall , 1998 ; Lowin - or for localization of Cdc42 and PKC (cid:1) at the leading Kropf et al . , 1998 ) . Cytochalasin D treatment had no edge . These results suggest the possibility that dynein effect on Cdc42 activation and astrocyte polarization , is downstream of a Cdc42 / mPar6 / PKC (cid:1) complex . The although it did prevent the formation of focal adhesions ; function and cellular localization of dynein / dynactin can this leads us to the conclusion that Cdc42 activation by be directly regulated via multiple sites of phosphoryla - integrin engagement does not require integrin clustering tion ( Bloom , 2001 ; Karki and Holsbaur , 1999 ) , and it or actin bundle recruitment ( Leng et al . , 1998 ) .

Clearly , activation of Cdc42 or PKC (cid:1) dynein - dependent reorientation of the MTOC , the Golgi , per se is not sufficient , and the establishment of polarity and microtubule network toward the leading edge . depends on their localized activation , in this case at the front of the migrating cell .

One simple hypothesis is that Cdc42 directly translocates from the cytosol to the plasma membrane , possibly via dissociation from a Rho Cell Culture and Wounding GDI as suggested by others for Rac and Rho ( Michael - Primaryastrocyteswerepreparedaspreviouslydescribed ( Etienne - Manneville et al . , 1999 ) . For wound - healing assays , cells were son et al . , 2001 ) . However , in agreement with recent seeded on ( poly ) L - ornithine - precoated coverslips or 90 mm diame - observations , we find Cdc42 localizes to endomem - ter dishes , grown in the presence of serum to confluence , and the branes ( mainly Golgi , but also vesicles ) in live cells ( Mi - mediumwaschanged16hrbeforewounding .
