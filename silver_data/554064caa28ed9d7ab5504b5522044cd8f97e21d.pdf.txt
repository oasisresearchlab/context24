Abstract As in mammals , only one cell in a Drosophila multicellular female germline cyst is specified as an oocyte . The symmetry - breaking cue for oocyte selection is provided by the fusome , a tubular structure connecting all cells in the cyst . The Drosophila spectraplakin Shot localises to the fusome and translates its asymmetry into a polarised microtubule network that is essential for oocyte specification , but how Shot recognises the fusome is unclear . Here we demonstrate that Shot’s actin - binding domain ( ABD ) is necessary and sufficient to localise Shot to the fusome and mediates Shot function in oocyte specification together with the microtubule - binding domains . The calponin homology domain 1 of Shot’s ABD recognises fusomal F - actin and distinguishes it from other forms of F - actin in the cyst . By contrast , the ABDs of Utrophin , Fimbrin , Filamin , as well as Lifeact and F - tractin do not recognise fusomal F - actin . We therefore propose that Shot propagates fusome asymmetry by recognising a specific conformational state of F - actin on the fusome . Introduction Both male and female gametes differentiate inside cysts of interconnected germ cells . Whereas all male cells in the cyst become sperm , only one or few of the female germ cells are specified to become oocytes in most animals ( Lu et al . , 2017 , Pepling and Spradling , 1998 , Lei and Spradling , 2013 ) . Since cells in the female germline cyst share cytoplasm through intercellular bridges , there must be specific mechanisms to select the future oocyte . This is only understood in Drosophila , where a polarised microtubule ( MT ) network that extends throughout the cyst directs the dynein - dependent transport of oocyte fate determinants into one cell ( Theurkauf et al . , 1993 ; Li et al . , 1994 ) . A similar mechanism could also be involved in oocyte specification in mouse cyst ( Lei and Spradling , 2016 ; Niu and Spradling , 2022 ) . In Drosophila , cyst formation and oocyte specification occur in the germarium at the very tip of the fly ovary ( Fig . 1A ) . Oocyte determination starts when a germline stem cell divides asymmetrically to produce a cyst progenitor , a cystoblast , that goes through 4 rounds of incomplete mitotic division to produce a cyst of 16 cells connected by intercellular bridges called ring canals ( de Cuevas et al . , 1997 ) . The cystoblast contains a spherical structure inherited from the stem cell called the spectrosome , which contains endoplasmic reticulum , spectrins and actin - binding proteins ( Lighthouse et al . , 2008 ) . At each subsequent division , new spectrosomal material forms in the ring canal connecting the two daughter cells and this fuses with the pre - existing spectrosome to form the fusome , which becomes a branched structure extending into all 16 cells of the cyst ( Lin et al . , 1994 ; De Cuevas and Spradling , 1998 ) . Because one cell inherits the original spectrosome / fusome from the cystoblast , this cell contains more fusomal material than the others and this ultimately specifies it as the pro - oocyte ( Lin and Spradling , 1995 ; De Cuevas and Spradling , 1998 ) . The first step in the translation of fusome asymmetry into oocyte specification is the recruitment of the Drosophila spectraplakin , Shot ( Roper and Brown , 2004 ; Nashchekin et al . , 2021 ) . Shot in turn recruits the MT minus end - binding protein Patronin ( CAMSAP in mammals ) to the fusome , where Patronin stabilises microtubule minus ends ( Goodwin and Vale , 2010 ; Jiang et al . , 2014 ; Nashchekin et al . , 2021 ) . The slight excess of Patronin in the future oocyte is then amplified by the dynein - dependent transport of Patronin and microtubule minus ends along the stabilised microtubules into this cell , leading to the formation of non - centrosomal microtubule - organising centres ( ncMTOCs ) in the future oocyte . Finally , these ncMTOCs nucleate a polarised MT network that directs the transport of oocyte determinants into this cell ( Grieder et al . , 2000 ; Bolívar et al . , 2001 ; Nashchekin et al . , 2021 ) ( Fig . 1B ) . Shot is a spectraplakin protein that belongs to a conserved family of actin - microtubule crosslinkers that include human Dystonin and MACF1 / ACF7 , which play important roles in cytoskeletal organisation during neurogenesis and in epithelia ( Lee and Kolodziej , 2002 ; Voelzmann et al . , 2017 ; Dogterom and Koenderink , 2018 ) . A distinct feature of spectraplakins is the presence of an actin - binding domain ( ABD ) at the N - terminus and a MT - binding module at the C - terminus , separated by a long rod domain consisting of plakin and spectrin repeats ( Fig . 1C ) . The ABD of spektraplakins consists of two tandem calponin homology domains , CH1 and CH2 and the MT - binding module is composed of the MT lattice - binding GAS2 domain and an unstructured C - terminal domain containing two SxIP motifs that interact with the MT plus end - binding protein EB1 ( Sun et al . , 2001 ; Honnappa et al . , 2009 ; Applewhite et al . , 2010 ; Alves - Silva et al . , 2012 ) . Although Shot transmits fusome asymmetry to Patronin localisation and the formation of the polarised MT network that specifies the oocyte , how Shot recognises the fusome is not known . Previous work suggested that the Shot ABD is not involved ( Roper and Brown , 2004 ) . Here we show , however , that the Shot ABD is necessary and sufficient for localisation to the fusome , but this involves the recognition of a form of F - actin that is different in some way from other F - actin networks in the cyst . Both the actin and MT - binding domains are required for oocyte specification , consistent with Shot ' s role in organising the polarised microtubule network . Results and Discussion The Shot actin - binding domain localises to the fusome To determine which domain ( s ) of Shot direct its localisation to the fusome , we expressed a mini - version of Shot that lacks the central rod domain , Shot - NC ( Figure 1C ) . It has been shown previously that the NC version of ACF7 ( a mammalian Shot homologue ) is able partially substitute ACF7 function in cells ( Wu et al . , 2008 ) . Like endogenous Shot and the full - length Shot transgene ( Fig . 1D and 1E , respectively ) , Shot - NC localised to the fusome ( Fig . 1F ) . This demonstrates that the fusome - binding activity of Shot resides in either its N - or C - terminal domains and that the central rod domain is dispensable for fusome localisation . Expression of either the N - or C - terminal domains alone showed that Shot - N binds efficiently to the fusome ( Fig . 1G ) , whereas Shot - C forms foci in the cytoplasm and accumulates in one cell of the cyst ( Fig . 1H ) , a pattern previously described for EB1 ( Nashchekin et al . , 2021 ) . Live imaging of Shot - C - YFP in the germarium revealed that it forms EB1 - like comets ( Video1 ) suggesting that the C - terminal domain of Shot associates with MT plus ends , and that the MT lattice - binding GAS2 domain is in an inhibited conformation , as shown for the mammalian Shot homologue , Dystonin , in Cos - 7 cells ( Kapur et al . , 2012 ) . Nevertheless , we decided to test whether the GAS2 domain has the potential to bind the fusome by expressing a portion of the Shot C - terminal domain containing the EF hand and the GAS2 domain that has strong MT binding activity ( Maybeck and Roper , 2009 ) . EF - GAS2 - GFP localised to the fusome in the presence of endogenous Shot ( Fig . 1I ) but failed to do so in shot mutant cysts ( Fig . S1 ) . Fusome - associated MTs are largely lost in the absence of Shot , indicating that EF - GAS2 - GFP localises to the fusome by binding to Shot - dependent MT ( Roper and Brown , 2004 ) . The GAS2 domain therefore cannot be responsible for the initial recruitment of Shot to the fusome . From our results so far , we speculated that Shot recruitment to the fusome requires the Shot N - terminal region containing the two Calponin homology domains that constitute the ABD . We therefore expressed a construct containing the just ABD of Shot fused to GFP in the cyst and confirmed its localisation to the fusome ( Fig . 1J ) . In contrast , full - length Shot lacking the ABD ( Shot ∆ABD ) did not localise to the fusome ( Fig . 1K ) . Thus , the ABD of Shot is both necessary and sufficient for fusome localisation , presumably by interacting with fusome - associated F - actin . Shot recognises a distinctive form of F - actin on the fusome Several actin - binding proteins have been identified as components of the fusome , including b - spectrin , Hts / Adducin , Tropomodulin and Shot ( De Cuevas et al . , 1996 ; Lin et al . , 1994 ; Lighthouse et al . , 2008 ; Roper and Brown , 2004 ) . However , actin has never been detected in the fusome and Phalloidin does not label the fusome , staining only the ring canals and the cell cortex of germline cysts ( Warn et al . , 1985 and Fig . 1D - K ) . In contrast , Actin - GFP in the cyst showed staining in the fusome raising the possibility that absence of Phalloidin staining might be misleading ( Fig . S2B ) . We therefore tested the presence of endogenous actin at the fusome by performing antibody stainings for actin using various fixation methods . Of all fixation methods used , only a combination of heat fixation followed by post - fixation with formaldehyde produced convincing actin staining at the fusome ( Fig . 2A ) . As a staining control we used hts mutant cysts ( Fig . S2A ) where the fusome is absent ( Lin et al . , 1994 ) , and confirmed that fusome - like actin staining was indeed missing under these conditions . We conclude that the fusome does contain F - actin , but not in a form that can be detected by Phalloidin . Since the Phalloidin - actin interaction is sensitive to the structure of F - actin filaments ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) , this suggests that fusomal F - actin exists in a distinct structural conformation that can be bound by the Shot ABD but not by Phalloidin . Both b - Spectrin and Shot are members of a large family of actin - binding proteins with ABDs formed by tandem CH domains ( Korenbaum and Rivero , 2002 ; Yin et al . , 2020 ) ( Fig . S2C ) . To test whether other CH domain proteins can recognise fusomal F - actin , we analysed the distribution of over - expressed Utrophin ABD and endogenously - tagged Filamin and Fimbrin . None of these CH domain proteins recognised fusomal F - actin and they mainly concentrated at ring canals ( Fig . 2B - D ) . F - tractin and LifeAct are commonly used F - actin markers ( Melak et al . , 2017 ) recognising a variety of F - actin structures ( Riedl et al . , 2008 ; Schell et al . , 2001 ; Belin et al . , 2014 ; Spracklen et al . , 2014 ) . When expressed in the germline cyst , each showed a unique distribution , but neither localised to the fusome . F - tractin mainly localised to the cell cortex ( Fig . 2E ) whereas LifeAct recognised the cell cortex and ring canals ( Fig . 2F ) . Moreover , substituting Shot’s ABD with the LifeAct sequence ( Shot ∆ABD - LifeAct ) did not restore fusome recognition to full - length Shot ( Fig . 2G ) . Thus , fusomal F - actin has a distinctive conformation that is only recognised by a subset of actin - binding proteins , including Shot’s CH1 - CH2 domain . The Shot ABD must therefore have structural features that allow it to bind preferentially to fusomal F - actin and to distinguish it from other F - actin structures in the cyst . This does not preclude Shot ABD binding to other forms of F - actin , since Shot re - localises to the cell cortex and ring canals in hts and a - spectrin mutant cysts where the fusome is not formed ( Lin and Spradling , 1995 ; De Cuevas et al . , 1996 ) ( Fig . S3 ) . The spatial arrangement of tandem CH1 and CH2 domains can regulate the actin binding activity of CH - domain containing proteins , as the CH2 domain can sterically hinder some of the actin binding surfaces on the CH1 domain ( Bañuelos et al . , 1998 ; Galkin et al . , 2010 ; Iwamoto et al . , 2018 ) . It has been shown that the transition between the “open” and “closed” conformations of the CH1 - CH2 domain in ACF7 ( the mammalian Shot homologue ) is regulated by phosphorylation of a conserved Tyr located at the very end of the CH2 domain ( Yue et al . , 2016 , Fig . 1C ) . Phosphorylation of the Tyr by Src / FAK kinases leads to an “open” conformation of the ACF7 ABD and enhances F - actin binding . To test whether Shot binding to the fusome is regulated by Tyr phosphorylation , we expressed the Shot ABD containing phosphomimetic and non - phosphorylatable versions of Tyr364 ( ABD Y364D and ABD Y364F , respectively ) . Whereas ABD Y364F still bound to fusomal F - actin ( Fig . 3B ) , ABD Y364D only did so in cysts in region 2a of the germarium and relocalised to ring canals in region 2b ( Fig . 3A ) . This suggests that the open versus closed conformation of the CH domains alters the specificity of Shot’s ABD for different forms of F - actin , rather than working as a simple on / off switch . It also suggests that the conformation of F - actin on the fusome differs between region 2a and 2b , which correlates with the transformation of the fusome from a thick tubular structure in 2a to a cable - like structure in 2b ( Lin et al . , 1994 ) . Since isolated ABDs could behave differently from the full - length protein , we introduced the same Tyr364 mutations into Shot - NC and full - length Shot . Whereas the Shot - NC Tyr364 mutants behave like the corresponding ABD mutants , the localisation of the full - length Shot was not affected by Tyr364 mutations ( Fig . 3C - F ) . This suggests that either the open / closed transition does not affect the actin binding of full - length Shot or that sequences located between Shot’s N - and C - terminal domains stabilise the ABD in the “closed” conformation , preventing the CH1 - CH2 transition to an “open” state . The rod domain in Shot is unlikely function as a second fusome - binding domain itself , because full - length Shot D ABD does not localise to the fusome . To test the importance of the CH1 and CH2 domains in Shot binding to the fusome , we analysed the localisation of full - length Shot lacking CH1 ( Shot ∆CH1 ) or CH2 ( Shot ∆CH2 ) . Shot D CH2 still localised to the fusome ( Fig . 3H ) , whereas the deletion of CH1 abolished fusome binding , leading to cytoplasmic localisation ( Fig . 3G ) . These results indicate that the CH1 domain mediates Shot binding to the fusome and that its intrinsic properties allow it to recognise a specific F - actin conformation that is invisible to several other CH - domain proteins and actin - binding molecules . This result also implies that recognition of fusomal F - actin by Shot does not require CH2 and is not regulated by the open / closed transition of the ABD . Structural studies on the interaction of CH domains with F - actin have revealed that CH1 simultaneously interacts with two adjacent actin monomers and is sensitive to the torque / helicity of F - actin filaments ( Hanein et al . , 1998 ; Iwamoto et al . , 2018 ; Kumari et al . , 2020 ; Harris et al . , 2020 ) . Changes in the helical twist of F - actin filaments can be caused by mechanical tension , by interactions with actin - binding proteins ( Harris et al . , 2018 ; Jégou and Romet - Lemonne , 2020 ; Harris et al . , 2020 ) , or by the bending of F - actin filaments promoted by differences in the nucleotide states of actin monomers ( Reynolds et al . , 2022 ; Oosterheert et al . , 2022 ) . It is therefore possible that CH1 domains of different actin - binding proteins are predisposed to bind F - actin filaments with specific helical twists , which could explain their distinct but partly overlapping localisation patterns ( Washington and Knecht , 2008 ; Harris et al . , 2020 ; Jégou and Romet - Lemonne , 2021 ) . The actin - and MT - binding domains of Shot are required for the oocyte specification In the absence of Shot , the oocyte is not specified leading to the formation of a 16 nurse cell follicle , but which domains of Shot are required for oocyte specification is not known ( Roper and Brown , 2004 ) . The cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding factor oo18 RNA - binding protein ( Orb ) is an early marker for oocyte specification which concentrates in the oocyte in regions 2b and 3 in wild - type germaria but it is uniformly distributed in shot null mutant cysts ( Lantz et al . , 1994 ; Roper and Brown , 2004 ) ( Fig . 4A and B ) . To determine whether the presence of Shot actin - or MT - binding domains are sufficient for oocyte specification , we expressed Shot - N , Shot - C , Shot - NC and Shot - EF - GAS2 in shot null mutant cysts ( Fig . 4C - F ) . Even though , Shot - N was able to bind to the fusome in the absence of endogenous Shot , it did not rescue Orb localisation and oocyte determination ( Fig . 4C ) . Neither Shot - C or Shot - EF - GAS2 were localised to the fusome or rescued oocyte specification in shot mutant cysts ( Fig . 4D - E , Fig . S1 ) . However , expression of Shot - NC was sufficient to restore oocyte specification in the absence of full length Shot ( Fig . 4F ) . Thus , both the ABD and MT - binding modules are necessary for Shot function during oocyte determination suggesting that Shot acts as an actin - microtubule cross - linker in this context . It has been previously reported that Shot’s ABD is not required for oocyte specification , since the oocyte is specified normally in cysts mutant for shot kakp1 , a P - element insertion in the intron upstream of CH1 - domain - coding exon that is predicted to prevent the expression of CH1 domain containing isoforms of Shot ( Roper and Brown 2004 ) . However , as we show above , Shot’s ABD is essential for the Shot localisation to the fusome and oocyte determination . To resolve this contradiction , we tested the requirement for Shot’s CH1 and CH2 domains in the oocyte specification , by expressing Shot ∆ABD , Shot ∆ABD - LifeAct , Shot ∆CH1 and Shot ∆CH2 in shot mutant cysts ( Fig . 4G - J ) . Shot truncations lacking the CH1 domain did not rescue oocyte specification , nor did substituting the Shot ABD with the actin - binding activity of LiveAct ( Fig . 4G - I ) . Only shot mutant cysts that expressed Shot ∆CH2 maintained correct Orb distribution and specified the oocyte ( Fig . 4J ) . Thus , Shot binding to the fusome through the CH1 domain of its ABD is essential for the oocyte specification . Since the shot kakp1 mutant does not affect oocyte determination , we assume that this P - element insertion does not disrupt the expression of CH1 - containing Shot isoforms in the germ line , although it does do so in somatic tissues ( Roper and Brown 2004 ) . Previously , it has been proposed that Shot binds the fusome with unidentified domain and uses its GAS2 domain to bind and stabilise MT ( Roper and Brown , 2004 ) . Based on our results we propose an alternative model for Shot function in oocyte determination where it works as a classical actin - MT cytolinker by recognising fusomal F - actin with its ABD and using its C - terminal domain to attach MT to the fusome . Which part of the MT module is involved in this process is an open question . On the one hand expression of Shot - EF - GAS2 can recognise fusomal MT . On the other hand , expression of the whole Shot C - terminal domain showed that the GAS2 domain is not exposed in the full - length protein and Shot interacts only with MT plus ends through its EB1 - binding motifs . Thus , Shot may guide the growth of MT plus ends along the fusome in a similar manner to that described for ACF7 in migrating cells ( Kodama et al . , 2003 ; Wu et al . , 2008 ) . The role of Shot in stabilising MT on the fusome could also be indirect , since it has been recently shown that Shot is required for fusome localisation of the MT minus - end stabilising protein Patronin / CAMSAP ( Nashchekin et al . , 2021 ) . Moreover , fusome - associated MT are unstable in patronin mutant cysts even though Shot is still present . How Shot’s C - terminus recruits microtubules to the fusome will therefore require further study . Our evidence suggests that the asymmetry of the fusome is propagated to MT organisation in the Drosophila female germline cyst by formation of a distinct type of F - actin on the fusome , which then recruits the spectraplakin Shot . How fusomal F - actin is formed and the structural basis for its recognition by actin - binding proteins remain to be determined . Considering that Shot is a conserved actin binding protein , it is possible that a similar mechanism is used in other contexts where F - actin filaments in a specific mechanical state are recognised by only a subset of actin - binding proteins , leading to the establishment of asymmetry within the cell .
