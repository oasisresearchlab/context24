Experience of the FEMH “Home - Hotel - Hospital” care model . Abstract In March 2022 , local cases of COVID - 19 infections of the Omicron variant were identified in Taiwan . In response to impending community transmission , the “Home - Hotel - Hospital” ( 3H ) care model was implemented by the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital ( FEMH ) . It established the first remote home care center in Taiwan and two quarantine centers in two hotels . The hospital focused on care for critical COVID - 19 patients , community screening , and telehealth care . The home care call center evaluated and triaged up to 104 , 244 cases and provided remote home care for 96 , 894 cases within the first three months ; in 2022 , it provided home care to 107 , 095 patients . The two quarantine hotels admitted a total of 1 , 834 individuals . A total of 3 , 796 COVID - 19 patients were admitted to the hospital—367 in intensive care . The telehealth outpatient clinic—including the online video clinic— served 25 , 775 cases ; 21 . 5 % ( n = 5 , 544 ) of them were prescribed oral anti - viral medications . In 2022 , the FEMH prescribed oral anti - viral therapies to a total of 12 , 571 cases . The FEMH 3H care model not only enabled non - critical patients to recover at home , but also provided severely ill patients access to timely in - hospital care . In the future , this model will continue to play a significant role in COVID - 19 management . Keywords : COVID - 19 ; remote home care ; telemedicine ; hospital response ; surge capacity J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Background The total number of COVID - 19 cases in Taiwan in late 2020—that is , when the pandemic began—was negligible . In 2021 , a surge in cases owing to the Alpha variant was experienced in northern Taiwan ; fortunately , it was controlled with a series of rapid responses and interventions . 1 The coverage of vaccination for COVID - 19 increased markedly after the surge . In November 2021 , the B . 1 . 1 . 529 ( Omicron ) variant of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus was first reported in South Africa ; it was reported to the World Organization of Health ( WHO ) on November 24 , 2021 . The WHO recognized that the Omicron variant could potentially circumvent the protection afforded by vaccines and natural induction of neutralizing antibodies 2 ; additionally , studies have shown that 40 % of Omicron cases were asymptomatic , 3 which facilitated widespread community transmission . As has been seen worldwide , a rapid surge of infections can collapse the healthcare system . 4 However , Omicron cases reported less severity compared to previous variants , which signaled a favorable opportunity for the society to adapt to the virus . Studies have revealed that efficient hospital - response strategies can successfully manage hospital capacity for COVID - 19 and non - COVID - 19 care . 5 - 13 The strategies comprise early risk - stratification , triage of COVID - 19 patients into homecare with adequate medications and remote monitoring , emergency room referral / hospitalization and intensive - care treatment , and early implementation of anti - viral therapies for high - risk patients . These initial steps are critical to preserve healthcare system resources , maintain the function of healthcare workforce , and reduce the mortality rates of both COVID - 19 and non - COVID - 19 patients . In March 2022 , local cases infected with the Omicron variant emerged in New Taipei City 14 after the government reduced the border - control quarantine duration from 14 to 10 days . Foreseeing the impending surge of cases , the New Taipei City government and Far J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Eastern Memorial Hospital ( FEMH ) planned the FEMH “Home - Hotel - Hospital” ( 3H ) care model to prevent unmanageable pressure on the healthcare system ( Figure 1 ) . The Government’s Strategy The Bureau of Health , New Taipei City Government initiated the “COVID - 19 Home Care Program” in New Taipei City from April 11 , 2022 , pursuant to the guidelines for the “Home Care Management of Confirmed COVID - 19 Cases” announced by the Central Epidemic Command Center ( CECC ) , Taiwan on April 8 , 2022 . 15 The New Taipei City COVID - 19 Home Care Program mandated holistic case management with ( 1 ) confirmed - case isolation , ( 2 ) proactive contact and coordinated service by health , civil , police , social welfare , and hospital administrations , ( 3 ) health assessment , and ( 4 ) referral to remote video clinics or hospitalization . As the ordinary public health facilities could not efficiently manage the overwhelming surge of cases , the New Taipei City government dedicated seven core hospitals to set up “Green Pathways” to handle the burgeoning confirmed COVID - 19 cases . Once patients had a confirmed COVID - 19 diagnosis , these hospitals provided the following services : ( 1 ) evaluated and triaged based on patients’ risk factors , ( 2 ) contacted patients to initiate isolation , ( 3 ) provided health education , ( 4 ) instructed patients to download New Taipei City Government’s iCare App , ( 5 ) instructed patients to complete the legally required epidemiology investigation questionnaire , ( 6 ) instructed patients to conduct self - monitoring of health , and ( 7 ) notified patients upon completion of isolation period . Health providers of the core hospitals could provide proactive care through phone calls and iCare digital technologies to continuously monitor the health condition of COVID - 19 patients . If indicated , the patients could be referred to hospitals for further treatment through Green Pathways . The Bureau of Health of New Taipei City Government collected the list of newly J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f diagnosed COVID - 19 patients from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control ( TCDC ) , and designated the list of patients to responsible hospitals daily . There are four million people in New Taipei City , and seven core hospitals were proposed with affiliated small hospitals . The FEMH was responsible for the Ban - Chiao and Su - Lin Districts— that is , a total population of 0 . 75 million . The Home - Hotel - Hospital Care Model The concept of the FEMH Home - Hotel - Hospital care model is illustrated in Figure 1 . First , to keep asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients at home , we established the first COVID - 19 call center in Taiwan on April 11 , 2022 . It was operated by the nursing staff at the FEMH—based on phone interviews with COVID - 19 - positive patients , they directed the patients to either stay at home , transfer to quarantine centers ( hotel ) , or referred them to hospitals for admission . Second , on April 6 , 2022 , two medical teams set up two designated quarantine hotels based on previous experience in setting up quarantine centers in two hotels . 16 , 17 The designated quarantine hotels admitted patients with risk factors and those without adequate accommodation for quarantine , and telehealth care access was provided via smartphone apps for video diagnosis and treatment advice . Additionally , these designated quarantine hotels acted as a detention basin for hospitalized patients after improvement upon initial treatment . Finally , the hospital focused on care for severe COVID - 19 patients and community screening , provided virtual clinic services , and telehealth care , and maintained medical capacity to care for regular and infected patients . Call Center for Home Care The FEMH pioneered the remote home care services , the call center , in Taiwan on J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f April 11 , 2022 . The nurse practitioners of the FEMH call center conducted triage by phone calls to COVID - 19 - PCR positive patients . Patients with high risk of developing severe illness ( e . g . , old age , dialysis , pregnancy , persistent fever , dyspnea , etc . ) were triaged to medicalized quarantine hotels or hospitals ; low - risk patients were triaged to receive remote home care . For the latter , the nurse practitioners monitored their self - reported symptoms and vital signs via the iCare App ; they proactively made phone calls to the less technology savvy patients to provide home care . The FEMH call center offered 33 landlines of 24 / 7 accessibility to receive call - in inquiries , to provide health counseling , to refer to remote clinics , and to transfer indicated patients to emergent room ( ER ) . The FEMH developed its own cloud - based “intelligent case management system” ( iCMS ) to efficiently identify and triage high - risk patients . Furthermore , the iCMS proactively sent outbound text messages and arranged remote outpatient visits to qualified high - risk patients for anti - viral therapies . To ensure timely antiviral medication , since May 8 , the iCMS incorporated COVID - 19 diagnosed cases and proactively initiated triage and medical therapies , without waiting for the Bureau of Health’s dispatch processes , which significantly reduced the waiting period from diagnosis to antiviral medications . Collaboration with Community Care - Providers and Clinics To invite participation and collaboration from community clinics , the FEMH extended the home care experience outside to external community clinics starting from May 4 , 2022 . Within three weeks , a total of 91 community clinics received referral from FEMH to take care of an accumulated 16 , 890 COVID - 19 patients . During the peak of the pandemic , the FEMH Home Care Center served as the coordinating center between the Bureau of Health of New Taipei City government and more than 200 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f community care - providers . The FEMH Home Care Center communicated critical information such as relaying top - down , rapidly modifying policies , as well as bottom - up community needs and realities back to the authorities . Early Anti - viral Treatment in Long - term Care Facilities Per contemporary rules , vulnerable long - term care facility residents would have to visit emergency rooms to undertake COVID - 19 PCR tests and returned the facilities , waiting for results of PCR tests and then conduct video clinics for anti - viral treatment if qualified per CECC guidelines . To reduce COVID - 19 - related complications in these vulnerable facility residents , the FEMH Home Care Center arranged remote video clinics on the same day of positive rapid antigen tests ( RAT ) and dispatched early anti - viral therapies for qualified patients since May 11 , 2022 . In 2022 , the FEMH established collaboration with 52 long - term care facilities , and operated 98 sessions of remote video clinics , which served 1 , 464 positive - rapid - antigen test ( RAT ) residents . Among them , 1 , 196 residents ( 81 . 6 % ) were prescribed anti - viral therapies following CECC guidelines . 18 This approach facilitated early intervention and preserved hospital resources . Transforming Hotels into COVID - 19 Dedicated Care Hotels Infection control was the initial critical step in transforming hotels into COVID - 19 dedicated care hotels . To enforce infection control , we segregated hotel elevators into “red , yellow and green zones” . The “red zone” was used by patients and by transporting medical waste . The “yellow zone” was used by staff to enter and exit the patient isolation area . Lastly , the “green zone” was only used by staff to commute to and from get off work . By strict segregation of three pathways , we tried to eliminate the risk of cross contamination . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Staffing with healthcare providers into the hotels was the second key step in the transformation , which included four staff groups of physicians , nurses , and original hotel service , security , and logistics staff . On - site physicians provided medical consultation and interpretation of rapid antigen testing ( RAT ) results of COVID - 19 . Nurses checked in the quarantined patients daily and provided the front - line care . The remaining staff groups were supported by original hotel staff and ensured the continued operation of the hotels . Through rapid deployment and close collaboration , FEMH worked with hotel staff groups in the transformed hotels for the unique “Hotel care” in the FEMH 3H care model . Hospital Service The Wan - Hua outbreak of May 2021 resulted in rapid expansion of service for hospitalized patients . 19 The major concern of specialized COVID - 19 service areas was whether negative pressure was necessary . Learning from previous experience , and confident because of significant vaccination coverage in the society , the staff provided care with proper personal protective equipment in designated wards without negative pressure rooms . The major concern in 2022 was that infected healthcare workers could not provide service . The peak of healthcare worker infection was approximately 1 % daily , which significantly depleted the workforce . Fortunately , most healthcare workers suffered only mild symptoms , and soon returned to work . In 2021 , during the Wan - Hua outbreak , the FEMH provided more than 50 beds in intensive care unit ( ICU ) and 138 beds in ward . In 2022 , the FEMH provided 30 beds in ICU and more than 200 beds in ward at the peak of the surge in May 2022 . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Evolution of Screening and Diagnosis Strategies Since the onset of the pandemic , the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) test has remained the gold standard for COVID - 19 diagnosis . However , the overwhelming rate of community transmission since April 2022 exceeded the existing PCR test capacity . Moreover , the turnaround time for PCR is long , and patients have to visit designated test centers for testing . Most importantly , awaiting PCR results often delays early antiviral treatment . Thus , starting May 12 , the TCDC modified its policy , eliminating the necessity of PCR results as the diagnostic criteria for COVID - 19 cases . People in home isolation or home quarantine were allowed to be legally diagnosed with COVID - 19 after a physician’s visual confirmation of positive rapid - antigen test ( RAT ) via the remote video clinic . In response to such “Diagnosis by Positive RAT” policy ( instead of “Diagnosis by Positive PCR” previously ) , the FEMH swiftly modified its administrative and information workflows and established remote video RAT confirmation clinics . These clinics utilized iCMS to confirm the patient’s legality , which simplified the workflow processes of uploading relevant documents and reporting to the Bureau of Health . On a rolling basis , the TCDC expanded the “Diagnosis by Positive RAT” policy to elderly patients since May 18 , and thereafter , to all patients since May 26 . To address the exponential increase in the demand for remote video clinics , the FEMH opened new remote video clinics at daytime , night time , and on holidays . PCR Testing for COVID - 19 Pandemic in the FEMH FEMH has meticulously established its 24 / 7 - available , rapid PCR testing capacity since initially obtaining TCDC - approval in February 2020 , and expanded its capacity from 10 , 109 in 2020 , to 150 , 598 in 2021 . And at the peak of outbreak and surged demands in May 2022 , the PCR testing capacity rose to 70 , 031 per month . Such vast J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f capacity and rapid turnaround of PCR testing provided strong support of early diagnosis and early treatment for the FEMH 3H Care Model . Results of the FEMH 3H Care Model COVID - 19 cases in Taiwan escalated after April 2022 , especially among the high - density population of northern Taiwan . When the pandemic peaked in late May , the daily new COVID - 19 positive count in Taiwan stood at approximately 100 , 000 . 14 The FEMH reported to the TCDC a total of 3 , 782 cases in April ; 63 , 684 in May ; 11 , 591 in June ; and a total of 101 , 854 cases in 2022 ( Figure 2 ) . At the beginning of the pandemic—from April to June 2022—our home care call center evaluated and triaged up to 104 , 244 COVID - 19 cases , and provided remote home care for 96 , 894 cases , of which 127 patients ( 0 . 13 % ) were later referred for in - hospital admission . In 2022 , we provided a total of 107 , 095 home care services ( Figure 3 ) . Two quarantine hotels admitted a total of 1 , 834 persons from May 2022 to July 2022 . Of these , 15 ( 0 . 8 % ) were referred to hospitals for admission ; 255 ( 13 . 9 % ) were transferred from hospital ward after receiving treatment at the hospital ; 597 ( 32 . 6 % ) were treated via online video clinics , and 98 ( 5 . 3 % ) patients were prescribed antiviral medications . A total of 4 , 069 COVID - 19 patients were admitted to the hospital—371 in intensive care and 153 deaths—with an overall mortality rate of 3 . 8 % in 2022 ( Figure 4 ) . The telehealth outpatient clinic—including the online video clinic—served 25 , 775 cases ; 21 . 5 % ( n = 5 , 544 ) of them were prescribed antiviral medications ( Figure 5 ) . In 2022 , the FEMH prescribed oral anti - viral therapies to 12 , 571 patients . At the peak of the pandemic in Taiwan , the FEMH dispatched up to 12 . 9 % of all oral anti - viral prescriptions in Taiwan—this was on May 18 , 2022—after the CECC permitted J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f outpatient prescriptions of oral anti - viral therapies for COVID - 19 RAT - positive patients aged > 65 y / o ( Figure 6 ) . Discussion Back in 2021 , at the peak of the initial COVID - 19 outbreak , the service volume of hospitalization in FEMH dropped 50 % , with 30 % of hospitalizations due to COVID - 19 . In contrast , in 2022 , the FEMH maintained 90 % occupancy of hospitalization and less than 20 % of hospitalizations were due to COVID - 19—we believed that this was mostly attributed to the FEMH 3H care model , high vaccination coverage , and oral anti - viral agents . Collectively , the FEMH offered remote care to a total of 107 , 095 COVID - 19 cases , admitted 1 , 834 persons in quarantine hotels , and hospitalized 4 , 069 cases in 2022 . Evolving Home Care Program Guidelines on a Rolling Basis The first version of the Home Care Program Guideline by the CECC ( April 8 , 2022 ) 15 applied only to COVID - 19 PCR - confirmed patients aged less than 65 with only mild or no symptoms . Additional exclusion criteria included pregnancy , dialysis , co - habitants without confirmed infection being younger than 65 years , non - pregnant , and without dialysis ; strict rules on single - room isolation were also applied . With the surge of confirmed COVID - 19 cases , the restrictions for the Home Care Program were relaxed . The modified CECC Home Care Program Guideline ( May 17 , 2022 ) eliminated dependence on the PCR test and relied on front - line physicians to diagnose and decide for home care—except for moderate to severe illness cases . The initial CECC Home Care Guideline stated that COVID - 19 patients could only take ambulance or quarantine taxi to hospitals—not their personal vehicles ; the modified guideline removed this restriction after April 20 , 2022 . Initially , a patient could be released from isolation only after a negative RAT result after 10 days of isolation ; gradually , this was reduced to five days , regardless of the RAT result . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f The Guideline listed the following criteria to trigger referral to hospitals : dyspnea ; respiratory distress ; persistent chest pain ; chest discomfort ; disturbed consciousness ; cyanosis of skin , lip , or nailbed ; tachycardia without fever ; inability to intake fluid , food , or medications ; and reduced urine output for 24 hours . Compared to COVID - 19 Home Care Programs elsewhere 6 , 7 , 10 , 12 , 13 , 20 - 23 , pulse oximeters or monitoring equipment were not provided for home care patients . Such extensive and rolling criteria implied significant workload of frontline healthcare providers who performed practice history taking , clinical examinations , and continuous monitoring . Therefore , the triage and caring process relied on the professionalism of the experienced medical personnel . As the pandemic subsided and accessibility to remote care improved , home - care for COVID - 19 patients returned to the usual primary care system . Diagnosis / treatment Criteria and Reporting System Strict criteria for diagnosis and treatment and a comprehensive reporting system are crucial for effective management and evaluation of communicable diseases ; however , healthcare systems possess limited capacity for this traditional structure . The reporting system was challenged in 2021 , and the communicable disease reporting system was initially shut down , and thereafter , simplified . A similar situation was re - observed in 2022—at a much larger scale . When a communicable disease spreads as did the Omicron variant , its impact can be overwhelming . With the modification of diagnosis criteria from the PCR to RAT , and the establishment of remote video clinics , a real - time number of cases diagnosed with RAT could be obtained , and oral anti - viral treatment could be immediately started . Although the pandemic has peaked , repeated and frequent COVID - 19 infections necessitate a revision of the current reporting system . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Conclusion The FEMH “Home - Hotel - Hospital” care model based on medical triage principles not only enabled asymptomatic / non - critical patients to recover at home , but also provided moderately severe to critically severe patients access to early in - hospital care . Additionally , transformation of hotels to designated quarantine centers helped divert the massive demand of in - hospital admissions , thus preserving medical capacity . In the future , this FEMH 3H care model will continue to play a significant role in COVID - 19 management .
