We have used electron tomography of 2D arrays of villin - crosslinked F - actin to generate 3D images re - vealing villin’s crosslinking structure . In these polar arrays , neighboring ﬁlaments are spaced 125 . 9 ± 7 . 1 A˚ apart , offset axially by 17 A˚ , with one villin cross - link per actin crossover . More than 6500 subvolumes containing a single villin crosslink and the neighbor - ing actin ﬁlaments were aligned and classiﬁed to produce 3D subvolume averages . Placement of a complete villin homology model into the average den - sity reveals that full - length villin binds to different sites on F - actin from those used by other actin - bind - ing proteins and villin’s close homolog gelsolin . INTRODUCTION Villin , an (cid:2) 95 kD actin crosslinking protein , is a member of the gelsolin superfamily ( Bretscher and Weber , 1980 ) . Gelsolin family proteinsregulateF - actinlengthbyseveringﬁlamentsand / orcap - pingthebarbedends . Eachmemberhasthreeorsixhomologous copies of a 120 amino acid ( (cid:2) 14 kD ) domain , the gelsolin - like do - main . Gelsolin and villin each have six such domains , denoted here as G1 – G6 and V1 – V6 , respectively . Villin has 45 % amino acidsequenceidentitywithgelsolinoverthesixdomains ( Finidori et al . , 1992 ) , suggesting that their tertiary structures are very similar . Gelsolin cannot crosslink F - actin whereas villin can , a property attributed to the presence of a small , 76 amino acid ‘‘head piece’’ domain at villin’s C terminus ( Glenney et al . , 1981 ) . Villin can nucleate actin polymerization , crosslink ﬁlaments , sever F - actin at high [ Ca 2 + ] or following tyrosine phosphorylation , and cap the barbed ends of ﬁlaments . Much of what is inferred about villin function and structure comes from a comparison with gelsolin , itsclosest homolog . Gelsolin’s function isregulated bycalciumbindingatuptoeightdifferentsites . Atsubmicromolar [ Ca 2 + ] , gelsolin folds into a compact autoinhibited state which places the tail helix of the C - terminal G6 domain close to G2 , cre - ating a steric block to G2 binding of F - actin ( Burtnick et al . , 1997 ) . Calcium binding to the type 2 ( intradomain ) site within G6 re - leases this inhibition ( Choe et al . , 2002 ) . Further calcium effects involvedomainrearrangementsthatrelease‘‘latch’’mechanisms between G1 and G3 to activate the G1 actin - binding site , and between G4 and G6 to allow G4 to participate in actin capping ( Choe et al . , 2002 ) . Further interaction of G1 and G4 with the ﬁlament via type 1 ( interdomain ) Ca 2 + ion coordination between actin and gelsolin leads to severing and capping . The severing mechanism requires micromolar [ Ca 2 + ] ( Yin and Stossel , 1979 ) . Villin , in contrast , has only three established calcium - binding sites ( Hesterberg and Weber , 1983a ) and requires [ Ca 2 + ] as high as 200 m M to activate severing . Such concentrations are not usually found in live cells , but might occur in apoptotic cells . Tyrosine phosphorylation of villin can reduce or even eliminate the calcium - binding requirement for severing , suggesting that phosphorylation may be the primary regulator of villin conforma - tion ( Kumar and Khurana , 2004 ) . The crystal structure of gelsolin’s domain G1 in complex with G - actin ( McLaughlin etal . , 1993 ) revealed G1boundinthehydro - phobic pocket between actin subdomains 1 and 3 where it caps the F - actin barbed end . The crystal structure of G1 - G3 in combi - nation with calcium and G - actin identiﬁed the unique G2 - G3 actin side - binding position ( Burtnick et al . , 2004 ) that competes with a - actinin for F - actin binding ( Way et al . , 1992 ) . Electron mi - croscopy ( EM ) difference mapping of G2 – G6 decorated F - actin in the presence of calcium localized the G2 - binding site on the side of F - actin , but the rest of the molecule was disordered ( McGough et al . , 1998 ) . The C - terminal half , G4 – G6 , has similarly been crystallized with calcium and G - actin and shows that G4 binds to G - actin in a similar fashion as G1 ( Choe et al . , 2002 ) . The crystal structure of full - length gelsolin in the inactive , cal - cium - free state revealed a compact , autoinhibited form in which G6 and G2 interact to form the above - mentioned ‘‘tail helix latch’’ that prevents the actin - binding regions from contacting actin ( Burtnick et al . , 1997 ) . Small - angle X - ray scattering of gelsolin revealed global conformational changes with increasing calcium and highly ﬂexible interdomain linkers ( Ashish et al . , 2007 ) . Structural data for villin are limited . Hydrodynamic and spec - troscopic studies have shown that villin in solution undergoes a large calcium - induced conformational shift to become more asymmetric , with an overall length increase from 84 to 123 A˚ ( Hesterberg and Weber , 1983b ) . These data led Hesterberg and Weber to suggest a ‘‘hinge mechanism’’ where calcium binding 1882 Structure 16 , 1882 – 1891 , December 10 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved creates a localized tightening of the villin structure coupled to an outward shift of another domain ( presumably thehead piece ) into solution . Recently , two potential latch residues have been identi - ﬁed based on sequence homology to gelsolin , Asp467 and Asp715 , that potentially form salt bridges with a cluster of basic residues in villin domain V2 ( Kumar and Khurana , 2004 ) . How - ever , no clear demonstration of villin in a folded , autoinhibited state exists . The solution NMR structure of V1 , also known as villin 14T , re - vealed an overall fold that is very similar to that of gelsolin G1 as predicted by the high sequence identity ( Markus et al . , 1994 , 1997 ) . Several structures exist for the villin head piece domain ( Frank et al . , 2004 ; McKnight et al . , 1997 ; Meng et al . , 2005 ; Var - dar et al . , 1999 ; Vermeulen et al . , 2004 ) . Cysteine scanning mu - tagenesis of this domain has provided comprehensive data for the surface distribution of basic residues and their presentation to actin ( Doering and Matsudaira , 1996 ) . A recent NMR structure of a V6 - headpiece construct demonstrated that the 40 amino acid connecting linker is unfolded and disordered ( Smirnov et al . , 2007 ) . Villin and ﬁmbrin , another actin crosslinking protein , are found together in the actin core of ﬁnger - like projections known as mi - crovilli in intestinal epithelium and kidney proximal tubules . Each microvillus contains 20 + polar actin ﬁlaments ( Tilney and Moose - ker , 1971 ) . Inthenormalmicrovillus , actinﬁlamentsareseparated laterally by (cid:2) 125 A˚ ( DeRosier et al . , 1977 ) . Microvilli form in villin - deﬁcient mice but they lack the typical discrete F - actin bundles within the core ( Ferrary et al . , 1999 ; Pinson et al . , 1998 ) , suggest - ingthat whereas theloss ofvillin canbe partially compensated by ﬁmbrin , the ﬁner structure of the microvillus may be speciﬁc to villin’s functions . Moreover , villin’s ability to induce microvillus formation is a function of its crosslinking ability , not its nucleating ability ( Friederich et al . , 1999 ) . It is not known how both ﬁmbrin and villin cooperate in the microvillus core or in vitro to bundle F - actin . Each crosslinking protein by itself may produce its own preferred F - actin bundle geometry , whereas in combination , a single compromise bundle geometry may occur . Figure1 .

Two types of 2D arrays are formed when ﬁmbrin crosslinks F - actin on a lipid monolayer , which suggests polymor - phism among ﬁmbrin crosslinks ( Volk - mann et al . , 2001 ) . In one type , adjacent ﬁlaments are in axial register , whereas in the second , adjacent ﬁlaments are dis - placed axially by 55 A˚ . This raises the question of whether the addition of villin crosslinks would favor one form of ﬁmbrin crosslink over the other . HereweemployelectrontomographyofF - actin : villin2Darrays tolearnin3DhowvillininteractswithandcrosslinksF - actininlow [ Ca 2 + ] . The 2D arrays provide a format to study the actin - bound structure of proteins that interact weakly with actin and have a tendency to form bundles either in vitro or in vivo and helps deﬁne speciﬁc protein - actin interactions as well as any polymor - phisms in the crosslinked ﬁlaments . Using multivariate data analysis ( MDA ) of subvolumes extracted from the tomograms , we show that the villin - actin contacts are homogeneous and different from contacts for other actin - binding proteins . Without calcium to activate it , villin can crosslink F - actin without disrupt - ing the ﬁlaments . We ﬁnd that the ﬁlament arrangement in F - actin : villin 2D arrays differs from F - actin : ﬁmbrin 2D arrays , suggesting that 3D actin bundles in microvilli involve arriving at a compromise structure or bonding rule . We also explore the novelty of these villin - actin contacts in the context of villin’s homology with gelsolin . RESULTS Image Alignment and Volume Classiﬁcation In the presence of EGTA , villin forms regularly spaced crosslinks along F - actin in 2D paracrystalline arrays R 1 m m wide formed on lipid monolayers . We collected six different single - axis tilt series and computed six tomograms . Subvolumes were combined after initial alignment on the actin ﬁlaments . Resolution was trun - cated to 38 A˚ , consistent with the position of the ﬁrst node of the contrast transfer function . The villin crosslinks , which occur once per actin crossover , appear as long , extended ‘‘squiggles’’ in the raw tomogram ( Figure 1A ; see Figure S1A available online ) , mea - suring between 126 and 140 A ˚ in length . The measured volumeof 130 . 2 3 10 3 A ˚ 3 for the villin crosslink indicates that 95 kD villin binds as a monomer . Actin ﬁlaments are predominantly sepa - rated by 126 A˚ ( Table 1 ) , a separation that is close to the value of (cid:2) 120 A˚ found for arrays of actin and ﬁmbrin ( Volkmann Structure Tomography of F - Actin : Villin Arrays Structure 16 , 1882 – 1891 , December 10 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 1883 et al . , 2001 ) and nearly identical to values obtained for microvilli ( DeRosier et al . , 1977 ; Matsudaira et al . , 1983 ) . Actin ﬁlaments in the arrays varied in their helical symmetries and their rotational orientations . Computed Fourier transforms of well - ordered regions within each of the six tomograms ( e . g . , Figure 1B ; Figure S1B ) were analyzed according to Sukow and DeRosier ( 1998 ) . Predominately , each neighboring ﬁlament is axially shifted 16 . 9 ± 0 . 4 A˚ up , from left to right ( Table 1 ) . The shift was conﬁrmed from measurements made on two global aver - ages , one in negative stain ( Figure 1C ) and one in ice ( Figure 1D ) . Of the well - ordered arrays analyzed , three showed no rotation between adjacent actin ﬁlaments , two showed a rotation of 5 . 4 (cid:3) , and one showed a rotation of 10 (cid:3) . Actin ﬁlament symme - tries varied from 13 / 6 ( 166 . 15 (cid:3) rotation between actin subunits ) to 54 / 25 ( 166 . 67 (cid:3) ) . One array in Table 1 ( # 5 ) showed a 17 A˚ smaller interﬁlament spacing and a 27 A˚ axial offset , values more than 3 s different from the averages of the other ﬁve . The axial rotational differences between adjacent ﬁlaments were also determined by rotational crosscorrelation in 1 (cid:3) steps . Although less accurate than the raft analysis described above because the missing wedge may affect the alignment , it mea - sures the entire set of crosslinks . Histograms of the rotation angles show predominately three groups centered on 0 (cid:3) , 5 (cid:3) , and 10 (cid:3) ( Figure S2 ) , consistent with the raft analysis . The most favored rotation by far is 0 (cid:3) , whereas there is little difference in the frequency of occurrence for 5 (cid:3) – 6 (cid:3) and 9 (cid:3) – 11 (cid:3) . The average axial shift obtained from this analysis was 13 . 5 ± 3 . 7 A˚ , in agree - mentwiththatdeterminedfromthearrayanalysis . Thus , although the axial shift seemed ﬁxed at 17 A˚ , variations of up to 10 (cid:3) in ﬁlament rotation appeared to be tolerated . The global average of the aligned subvolumes shows clearly the shape of the villin and its location relative to the actin subunits ( Figure 1C ) . The 17 A˚ axial ﬁlament shift brings the right - side ac - tin subunit closer to the left - side subunit . Thus , the actin subunits that interact with villin are offset axially only 27 (cid:4) 17 = 10 A˚ . Three contacts are seen between villin and actin , two across the top and one on the left side at the bottom . These contacts are also seen in the projection of frozen - hydrated arrays ( Figure 1D ) . The two projections are virtually identical , showing that the struc - tures of negatively stained arrays are the same as those in frozen - hydrated arrays . Using MDA ( Winkler and Taylor , 1999 ) , we separately charac - terized the heterogeneity in the actin ﬁlaments and the villin crosslinks during our initial rounds of alignment . Once the subvo - lumes were sufﬁciently aligned to the global average , further classiﬁcation of the villin crosslink was done based on the vari - ance calculated in the region of the villin density . The resulting class averages ( Figure 2 ) show that , in some cases , potential villin crosslinking sites are unoccupied , some sites show partial villin density , whereas other variations can be explained by villin ﬂexibility . The partial villin density could be attributed either to negative staining effects or proteolysis because villin , like gelso - lin , is susceptible to cleavage of its long interdomain linkers ( Bazari et al . , 1988 ) . An F - Actin : Villin Crosslink Model Byrigid - bodyﬁtting , wedocked theatomicmodelfora13 / 6actin ﬁlament into our F - actin volume in the tomogram . A quasi - atomic model for chicken villin was created ( see Experimental Proce - dures ) based on the known structures of villin domains V1 and the head piece and homology models from gelsolin for domains V2 – V6 . We then placed V1 , V2 , V3 , and the head piece as individ - ual domains into the villin volume , and placed V4 – V6 as a group ( Figure 3 ) . In the class averages there appear to be at least three contacts of villin with the actin ﬁlament , with a fourth possible . The two contacts at the top of the density are far enough apart to accommodate two gelsolin domains ( Figures 3A and 4A ) . These are tentatively labeled V1 and V2 , because at this resolu - tion it is impossible to distinguish them . Because of the connect - ing linker , it is also not possible to determine with certainty the orientation of V1 and V2 . The small tail region ﬁts the villin head piece structure , but is too small for a gelsolin - like domain ( Fig - ure 4D ) . Likewise , the head piece is too small for the V1 - V2 den - sity ( Figure 4C ) . Theheadpiececrownofpositivecharge , located on the C - terminal helix , was placed facing the actin ﬁlament ( Fig - ures 3 and 4B ) according to the ﬁtting of the dematin head piece on F - actin ( Chen et al . , 2003 ) . The 40 amino acid unfolded linker between V6 and the head piece may explain the thin and variable crook of density we see leading from the villin core to the F - actin interacting site ( Smirnov et al . , 2007 ) . This same weak density corresponding to the N terminus of the head piece was observed byChenetal . inanEMmapofthedematinheadpiece - decorated F - actin ( Chen et al . , 2003 ) . The dematin head piece has (cid:2) 47 % sequence identity with the villin head piece ( Rana et al . , 1993 ) . Perhaps the most curious aspect of the villin contacts with F - actin is that the location on actin is different from that of other Table 1 .

The arrangement of V1 and V2 within the density indicates an interaction with actin subdomains 1 and / or 4 , unlike those typical for gelsolin - like domains ( Burtnick et al . , 2004 ; Choe et al . , 2002 ) . G1 binds in a hydrophobic pocket be - tween actin subdomains 1 and 3 ( Figure 4 ; Figure S3 ) . However , binding of G1 is characteristic of end - capping proteins . The actin - binding domain ( ABD ) of a - actinin binds to two adjacent actin protomers by contacting subdomains 1 and 2 on one actin protomer and subdomain 1 of the next protomer up the ﬁlament . This corresponds to actin residues 86 – 117 of the lower protomer and residues 350 – 375 of the upper protomer ( Fabbrizio et al . , 1993 ; Lebart et al . , 1990 , 1993 ; McGough et al . , 1994 ; Mimura and Asano , 1987 ) . The gelsolin G2 domain has a similar actin interaction ( McGough et al . , 1998 ) . Although the loops on the ends of the actin - binding helices in V1 and V2 are in close prox - imity to actin residues 358 – 365 ( Figure 5 ) , the rest of the protein density is oriented back and away from the a - actinin / G2 binding region . Although the exact binding site of villin’s head piece on F - actin is unknown , competition - binding assays have indicated that the villin head piece can displace the binding of the actin depolyme - rizing factor , which suggests that it binds to actin in the same hydrophobic binding pocket as G1 and other capping proteins ( Pope et al . , 1994 ) . However , the position of the villin head piece density in our reconstruction is not in this hydrophobic pocket . Instead , it is positioned near two a helices , one from actin subdo - main 3 ( residues 308 – 320 ) and one from subdomain 4 ( residues 222 – 236 ) . The head piece localization is invariant among the class averages . Compatibility with the F - Actin : Fimbrin Crosslink Model The F - actin : ﬁmbrin 2D arrays and the F - actin : villin 2D arrays have different geometries : the former has either a 0 or 55 A˚ offset , and the latter have a 17 A˚ offset , which raises the question of what types of changes would be required to place the villin model into the F - actin : ﬁmbrin crosslink model . We explored this in two ways ( Figure 6 ) . For both models , we built a modiﬁed F - actin : ﬁmbrin crosslink by combining the coordinates of the F - actin : ﬁmbrin crosslink from Volkmann et al . ( 2001 ) with recent data for the interaction of ﬁmbrin’s ABD2 with F - actin from Galkin et al . ( 2008 ) . The ﬁrst model ( Figure 6A ) was built using the 17 A˚ ﬁlament offset with a modiﬁed ﬁmbrin crosslink . Despite the offset , the two ﬁmbrin coordinate sets could be placed on actin as determined separately without steric clash . Recent results on the structure of F - actin decorated with ﬁmbrin ABDs indicate that the actin - bound ABD1 is poorly ordered , suggest - ing ﬂexibility or polymorphism in one of its CH domains’ interac - tion with actin ( Galkin et al . , 2008 ) . For the second model ( Figure 6B ) , we remodeled ﬁmbrin as described above as well as villin and kept the ﬁlaments in axial register with no offset . A villin crosslinker must bind both actin ﬁlaments , and this could be accomplished using no axial offset by eliminating the V2 - actin interaction . V2 still remains close to actin , but any residual interaction must involve different surfaces of both V2 and actin . The head piece linkage to V6 also required remodeling , but it is known to be ﬂexible . DISCUSSION Villin is a compact 84 A˚ molecule in solution but extends to about 123 A˚ on the binding of calcium ( Hesterberg and Weber , 1983b ) . Our map is well ﬁt by an extended villin molecule and bears a striking similarity to a recent structure obtained by small - angle X - ray scattering of Ca 2 + - activated gelsolin ( Ashish et al . , 2007 ) . However , our specimens are formed in low [ Ca 2 + ] and with actin . Although we do not know whether the villin conformation in the crosslink is the same as that in an actin - free calcium medium , the two forms of these highly similar molecules , one compact , the other extended , reinforce the hypothesis that villin contains a number of ﬂexible hinges . Villin Forms an Unusual F - Actin Crosslink The class averages of F - actin : villin were surprisingly similar ( Fig - ure 4 ) , consistent with constancy of villin - actin contacts . Poly - morphism in the arrays is largely due to differences in rotations of adjacent actin ﬁlaments around the ﬁlament axis . The glancing contacts of villin at the outermost edge of the actin protomers ( Figures 3 , 4A , and 5 ) suggest that each bond contributes only weakly to the total binding . Multiplicity of weak interaction sites , in fact at least three such sites , cooperatively stabilizes the crosslinking in the presence of the high F - actin concentration in the microvillus . It would also give villin a dynamic interaction with the actin bundle , allowing it to rapidly convert between different bound conﬁgurations . Unlike gelsolin , villin possesses an F - actin crosslinking activ - ity , which was largely thought to reside in its unique head piece . 412 503 453 637 831 533 542 296 0 3 1 4 5 7 6 2 A B Figure 2 .

We suspect that the head piece is essential for holding villin on F - actin and that crosslinking occurs via V1 - V2 . In the quasi - atomic model , end loops on V1 and V2 , both of which con - tain arginine and lysine residues , are placed on an acidic a helix of actin subdomains 1 and 4 , forming a predominately electro - static association . The buried surface is small , suggesting a weak and dynamic interaction . It is not known whether a V1 - V3 villin fragment could crosslink actin ﬁlaments on its own , as sug - gested by one of our class averages , but optimal placement of the actin ﬁlaments produced by full - length villin crosslinks may be an important factor in the present case . Comparison with F - Actin : Fimbrin Arrays The organization of ﬁlaments in F - actin : ﬁmbrin arrays differs from that found in F - actin : villin arrays . Filament separation in F - actin : ﬁmbrin arrays is (cid:2) 120 A˚ whereas it is 126 A˚ in F - actin : vil - lin arrays , identical to that found in microvilli . Fimbrin also formed two types of arrays , one with a 0 A˚ and the other with a 55 A˚ axial offset between neighboring ﬁlaments . Both ﬁmbrin arrays , on average , have no relative rotation between actin ﬁlaments . F - actin : villin arrays have a consistent 17 A˚ axial shift between neighboring actin ﬁlaments but a variable 0 (cid:3) – 10 (cid:3) ﬁlament rota - tion . Our results show that the ﬁmbrin and villin binding sites in the bundles do not overlap , so that coexistence in the same bundle is possible . In other respects , some accommodation is necessary for an integrated bundle geometry . It would appear that for villin and ﬁmbrin to coexist in the same microvillar bundle requires either villin , ﬁmbrin , or both to alter their mode of interaction with actin to accommodate the dif - ference in preferred actin ﬁlament offsets , with perhaps the linkers between domains performing a key role . It is somewhat surprising that ﬁmbrin , with shorter linkers between its ABDs , demonstrates two different crosslink geometries whereas villin , possessinglonglinkersbetweendomains , demonstratesasingle geometry . The model shown in Figure 6A suggests that the 17 A˚ offset seems to be compatible for forming a ﬁmbrin crosslink . At a AA B Figure 3 . Model of Villin Crosslinking F - Actin ( A ) Placement of the villin homology model atomic coordinates within the averaged villin density . ( B ) Schematic of villin domain topology with the approximate location of linkers shown . minimum , two contacts by villin are required for crosslinking . Our modeling ( Figure 6B ) suggests that a minimal villin crosslink could adapt to the axially aligned ﬁlament geometry dictated by ﬁmbrin by eliminating the V2 - actin bond and remodeling the link between the villin head piece and V6 to accommodate the 17 A˚ shift . Although plausible , the cross - link would probably be less energetically favorable compared to the three - bond crosslink seen in the F - actin : villin rafts . Another possibility is that once localized in the densely packed microvillus , villin could play a passive role in bundle geometry by simply binding to the side of a single actin ﬁlament using the V2 and head piece bind - ing sites . However , side binding would be less effective for targeting to the microvillus than crosslinking , which is a function of bundle geometry . Either way , the ability of villin to determine / dictate the physical geometry of the bundle is reduced because one interaction is lost . Both villin and ﬁmbrin crosslinks produce exceptionally high local actin concentrations , negating the need for strong actin af - ﬁnity for bundling . Cooperativity among multiple binding sites would stabilize the bundle . With weak interactions , the off rates for any one of the villin - actin bonds would be high , promoting the ability to change conformation quickly if conditions change . The high local actin concentration would produce high on rates that keep villin concentrated within the bundle . If ﬁmbrin is the dominant inﬂuence on the bundle structure , possibly villin would have only two binding sites , making it highly dynamic in vivo . Multiple weak interactions could serve as a positioning / locating mechanism for villin on the ﬁlaments , facilitating concentration of villin into the bundle , even if the rate might be slow . In high [ Ca 2 + ] , both ﬁmbrin and villin would lose their crosslinking capability , so that the bundle would collapse rapidly with no active crosslinkers and an active severing protein embedded within it . We envision a scenario of quick conversion from bundling to severing without large - scale diffusion of villin , conﬁning actin ﬁlament cleavage to a localized area . Implications for In Vivo Actin Bundles Theoretically , one way to form a hexagonal bundle of actin ﬁlaments using a single crosslinker is for the actin ﬁlaments to all be arranged in axial register ( DeRosier and Tilney , 1982 ) . This allows a single quasi - equivalent bonding rule to deﬁne all the crosslinks , even for actin ﬁlaments with different helical pitch . However , there are published examples of images and diffrac - tion patterns of actin bundles possessing well - oriented actin ﬁl - aments with crossovers having regular offsets ( DeRosier et al . , 1977 ; DeRosier and Tilney , 1982 ; Tilney et al . , 1980 ) . Indeed , Structure Tomography of F - Actin : Villin Arrays 1886 Structure 16 , 1882 – 1891 , December 10 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved one report ( DeRosier and Tilney , 1982 ) observed an axial offset of 18 A˚ in the actin bundles in stereocilia , in which ﬁmbrin is the dominant crosslinker . However , these offsets are generally attributed to bending of the actin bundle ( Tilney et al . , 1983 ) rather than to a general feature of the bundle organization . The formation of hexagonal bundles of actin ﬁlaments with a regular twist requires that the crosslinkers tolerate 4 (cid:3) – 5 (cid:3) of azimuthal variation in the orientation of their actin binding sites ( DeRosier and Tilney , 1982 ) . Local variations in the F - actin helical twist ( Egelman et al . , 1982 ) or even actin protomer ﬂexibility may reduce this amount . Assuming the helix is regular , our results show that villin crosslinks form with azimuthal variations be - tween actin ﬁlaments of up to 10 (cid:3) . On this criterion , villin appears to be well suited for a crosslinking role in a hexagonal bundle . In other ways , villin appears to be poorly suited to hexagonal bundle formation . At a minimum , two actin contacts are required for villin to crosslink F - actin , one on V1 and the other on the head piece . However , our reconstructions show three : an additional contact is formed by V2 . We think that the rigid selection of a 17 A˚ offset is determined by the V1 - V2 arrangement because the density con - necting the head piece with V6 is very thin , suggesting ﬂexibility in this location , consistent with the disorder observed in solution ( Smirnov et al . , 2007 ) . Flexibility between the head piece and V6 would make the head piece an effective crosslinker under a vari - ety of conditions , but poor with respect to enforcing a particular geometry . In addition , one class average having the same 17 A˚ offset as the others appeared to contain a villin molecule trun - cated after V3 and therefore had no villin head piece ( # 3 in Fig - ure 2 ) but still retained the V1 - V2 arrangement . We suspect that a ﬂexible head piece would allow villin to accommodate a ﬁlament arrangement , speciﬁcally a ﬁlament alignment between crosslinked actins dictated by the ﬁmbrin crosslinks . Unlike the other gelsolin - like domains , V1 and V2 appear to be relatively inﬂexibly joined ; otherwise , there should be more variation in the actin ﬁlament offsets . In the class average used for quasi - atomic model building , the density connecting head piece and V6 is narrow but would accommodate the linker in a folded con - formation ( although our structure here is entirely hypothetical ) , suggesting that crosslinking may induce a folded state of this otherwise mobile segment . However , other classes show even less linker density , consistent with high ﬂexibility . The apparent incompatibility between F - actin : villin bundles and F - actin : ﬁmbrin bundles may be explicable in two ways . Villin is not necessary for formation of microvilli , but its absence leads to poorly ordered bundles ( Pinson et al . , 1998 ) . Villin appears A B D C Figure 4 .

Likewise , V1 ( blue ) is positioned between the same regions of actin on the right - hand ﬁlament . ( B ) Position of the villin head piece . The head piece helix residues 62 – 76 , which include the ‘‘crown of positive charge , ’’ are positioned toward actin and in the vicinity of helix residues 308 – 320 on actin subdomain 3 ( S .

( D ) Replacement of the head piece by V1 . The gel - solin - like domain is too large for this density . Thus , the head piece placement determines the overall orientation of the villin crosslink model . A B Figure 5 .

If villin appears early , it might favor formation of crosslinks with 17 A˚ offsets . An offset of 17 A˚ is closer to the aligned crosslink produced by ﬁmbrin , rather than the alternative 55 A˚ offset that ﬁmbrin can form . Our modeling suggests that with a 17 A˚ offset , ﬁmbrin can form a crosslink , which we spec - ulate would anneal / adjust to one with no offset as long as the villin bonds are forming and dissociating rapidly , which our struc - ture suggests is indeed the case . Villin would then be the agent favoring an aligned bundle . Its absence would force a disordered bundle , as ﬁmbrin by itself would form crosslinks with different offsets . Villin , having multiple weak and variable interactions with actin , would be retained in the aligned bundle , where it performs an important role for remodeling and disassembly of the microvilli ( Glenney et al . , 1980 ) . Villin’s multiple weak interactions with actin would also be important for the mechanical characteristics of the bundle . Villin and ﬁmbrin occur in approximately equal quantities in the micro - villus ( Matsudaira and Burgess , 1979 ) , and our results show that their interaction sites do not compete with each other . If villin crosslinked actin as strongly as ﬁmbrin , it would have important consequences for the mechanical characteristics of the bundle . Fimbrin by itself has crosslinking characteristics that are ideal to accommodate bending in the bundle ( Claessens et al . , 2006 ) . Vil - lin , as a weak actin binder , would have dynamic bonds with rapid on and off rates that may have little effect on the mechanical properties of the bundle while permitting villin to occupy the bundle in high concentration . Modes of F - Actin Binding among Homologous Domains It is commonly assumed that homologous actin binding proteins interact similarly with actin , although this is not always the case , as shown for the widely studied ABDs composed of calponin homology domains which include those of ﬁmbrin , a - actinin , utrophin , dystrophin , and calponin itself ( Galkin et al . , 2006 , 2008 ) . Our research identiﬁes a novel interaction between actin and villin that is not predicted by actin - bound structures of villin’s closest homolog gelsolin and bears on the question of similarity of actin interactions by homologous proteins . Despite the high sequence identity between villin and gelsolin in the six main domains , the F - actin - villin interactions observed here are uncharacteristic when compared to the known interac - tions of gelsolin with F - actin or G - actin . However , our work per - tains to a capability of villin for interacting with actin in low [ Ca 2 + ] that gelsolin completely lacks . Villin’s actin crosslinking activity is present in low [ Ca 2 + ] , under which conditions its severing and capping activity are minimal . Essentially , villin crosslinks F - actin while in its enzymatically ‘‘inactive’’ state . Gelsolin is also enzy - matically inactive in low [ Ca 2 + ] and forms a folded conformation that blocks its surfaces that participate in actin binding , severing , and capping . Our reconstructions show that the villin ‘‘inactive’’ state bears no resemblance to the gelsolin inactive state . In low [ Ca 2 + ] , the homologous actin interaction sites of gelsolin are not placed appropriately for F - actin crosslinking as they are in villin . It is therefore not surprising that the F - actin : villin crosslinks in low [ Ca 2 + ] cannot be predicted by gelsolin - actin interactions in high [ Ca 2 + ] . Interactions with F - actin in high [ Ca 2 + ] , under which con - ditions both villin and gelsolin cap and sever F - actin , could be closely parallel , but that remains to be shown . It also remains to be determined whether villin forms a gelsolin - like inactive con - formation in the absence of F - actin , which would imply that actin induces a conformational change that results in crosslinking . That the more than 6500 villin crosslinks were so homogeneous in their structure suggests that what we have observed is not an exceptional case for actin interaction in this protein , but rather a legitimate mode of interaction for gelsolin - like domains . This is a further illustration that inferring protein - protein interactions based on homology alone may be misleading unless the func - tional roles are also homologous . In summary , we have used electron tomography of 2D F - actin : villin arrays and subvolume classiﬁcation to obtain what to our knowledge is the ﬁrst 3D image of villin in a crosslink - ing role . The structure of the villin crosslinks and the interactions of the individual villin domains with actin could not have been predicted from the known gelsolin - actin structures . The speciﬁc geometry of the 2D arrays determined by the villin crosslink is different from that found in F - actin : ﬁmbrin arrays . However , villin possesses some rather long interdomain linkers , which may A B Figure 6 . Fimbrin and the F - Actin : Villin Crosslink Model To demonstrate compatibility between these two co - crosslinkers , we placed the atomic coordi - nates of ﬁmbrin ABD2 ( orange ) on the left - hand actin ﬁlament and ABD1 and the calmodulin - like domain ( violet ) on the closest right - hand actin monomer . It is not known exactly how these domains interact with one another in a crosslink , but all are accommodated within the context of our model without a steric clash . ( A ) Model built with the two actin ﬁlaments offset by 17 A˚ . ( B ) Model built with the two actin ﬁlaments in axial register . In this model , the interaction between V2 and actin must be broken and the head piece linker rebuilt .

Our modeling suggests that villin has sufﬁcient ﬂexibility to bind or crosslink F - actin in cooperation with ﬁmbrin in the microvillus , thereby stabilizing the structure and , at the same time , embedding within it the apparatus for rapid disassembly . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Puriﬁcation and Array Formation Villin was puriﬁed from chicken intestines ( Burgess et al . , 1987 ) . Actin was prepared from rabbit muscle acetone powder ( Pardee and Spudich , 1982 ) , followed by a Superose - 12 column . Fresh G - actin was prepared by dialysis overnight against 2 mM Tris - Cl , 0 . 2 mM Na 2 ATP , 0 . 02 % b - mercaptoethanol , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 ( pH 8 . 0 ) . The protein was clariﬁed by high - speed centrifugation prior to sample setup . Arrays were grown on positively charged lipid monolayers ( Taylor and Taylor , 1994 ) . A 3 : 7 volume ratio of DLPC : DDMA lipids ( Avanti PolarLipids ) at1mg / mlinchloroform waslayeredover asolution containing 0 . 35 m M a - actin and 0 . 14 – 0 . 17 m M villin in phosphate - buffered polymerizing buffer without CaCl 2 and with 1 mM EGTA ( pH 6 . 5 ) . The actin was polymerized in the presence of villin at 4 (cid:3) C . EM Data Collection The 2D arrays were recovered using 200 – 300 - mesh copper grids with a retic - ulated carbon support ﬁlm ( Kubalek et al . , 1991 ) . Samples were stained with 2 % uranyl acetate , dried , and stabilized by a thin layer of evaporated carbon . Data were collected on a Philips CM300 - FEG . Six tomograms were recorded at 24k magniﬁcation with 1 . 8 3 postmagniﬁcation at the CCD camera . The sample was tilted using a 2 (cid:3) Saxton scheme ( Saxton and Baumeister , 1982 ) and recorded on a 2k 3 2k CCD camera ( TVIPS ; GMBH , Gauting , Germany ) . Image Processing Tiltserieswerealignedusingmarker - freealignment ( WinklerandTaylor , 2006 ) . Repeat coordinates centered on each actin crossover from each tomogram were manually picked using the EMAN Boxer utility ( Ludtke et al . , 1999 ) . Raw repeats ( 6566 ) were extracted as 64 3 144 3 40 voxel boxes . Images were then normalized by subtracting the mean and scaling the standard devi - ation to 1 . Repeats from each tomogram were aligned in 3D to the two cross - linked actin ﬁlaments using in - house software . After the best alignments were attained , as judged by classiﬁcation of the actin ﬁlaments , the repeats from each tomogram were compiled into a single data set and aligned once more to the global average . Classiﬁcation Aligned subvolumes were classiﬁed using MDA with a 3D mask derived from the variance map of the global average . Classiﬁcations were done using be - tween 8 and 32 factors , but ones made with the top 16 gave the best results . Thenumberoffactors ( eigenimages ) usedintheclassiﬁcationwasdetermined by inspecting each factor and from a plot of the variance ( eigenvalues ) as a function of factor number . Analysis of 2D Array Structure Regions of homogeneous crosslinks were boxed from each tomogram , pro - jected , and their Fourier transforms calculated after padding into a square array . The layer line and row line spacing was determined from the transforms and the reciprocal lattice drawn . Vertical row lines were placed over the three innerlayerlines , 0 , 1 , and2 , andovertheouterlayerlines , 5 , 6 , and7 . Whenthe two sets of row lines intersect , there is no rotation between neighboring ﬁlaments and when they do not , there is a rotation about the ﬁlament axis , the amount of which can be determined , provided that the axial translation is known . This analysis also determined the helical symmetry . Modeling The Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) coordinates of an actin monomer were used to generate an atomic model of F - actin with 13 / 6 helical symmetry ( PDB ID code1ATN ) . Homologymodels forchicken villin ( Swissprot accessionnumber P02640 ) were created using SWISS - MODEL ( Schwede et al . , 2003 ) based on the structures for villin 14T ( PDB ID code 2VIK ) , gelsolin domains G2 - G3 in an open conformation ( PDB ID code 1RGI ) , the gelsolin G3 - G4 linker through G6 intheclosed conformation ( PDB ID code 1D06 ) , and thevillin head piece ( PDB ID code 1YU5 ) . The disordered sequence linking V6 to the head piece was modeled based on other ﬂexible linkers from the above structures . Manipula - tionofthePDBﬁlesandenergyminimizationwasperformedusingtheMMTSB Tool Set ( Feig et al . , 2004 ) . Coordinates were checked with PROCHECK ( Laskowski et al . , 1993 ) . Models of villin crosslinks were created in Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) .
