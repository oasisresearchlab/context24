Onitilo et al . doi : 10 . 3121 / cmr . 2009 . 825 Breast Cancer Subtypes Page 2 Abstract Objective : Four breast cancer subtypes defined by immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) expression of estrogen receptor ( ER ) or progesterone receptor ( PR ) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( Her2 ) are ER / PR + , Her2 + ; ER / PR + , Her2 - ; ER / PR - , Her2 + ; and ER / PR - , Her2 - . Methods : A 7 - year retrospective study of 1134 invasive breast cancer subjects . Clinical and pathologic features and survival of the four subtypes were compared . Results : Using ER / PR + and Her2 - as a reference , ER / PR - , Her2 - had worst overall survival ( hazard ratio , 1 . 8 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1 . 06 - 3 . 2 ) , and worst disease - free survival ( hazard ratio , 1 . 5 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 8 - 3 . 0 ) . In ER / PR + , Her2 - , chemotherapy conferred significant overall and disease - free survival advantages . Subtype comparison revealed statistically significant differences in outcomes . Conclusion : Triple negative subtype having worst overall and disease free survival . Efforts should be directed at standardization of current testing methods and development of more reliable and reproducible testing .

Consensus regarding the definitive prognostic / predictive analysis has yet to be reached , but significant progress continues to be made in the ongoing search for a specific , rigorous and reproducible method of identifying successful treatment algorithms utilizing biological markers . Recent attentions have been directed singularly at molecular classifications of breast cancer . 3 - 11 While molecular and genetic testing is very “elegant , ” prognostic and predictive , it is expensive and not yet widely available . Also , despite the prognostic information provided by the molecular test , current reports of assay results impart little specific guidance of response to targeted and proven therapy ; for example , endocrine and trastuzumab therapy for tumors expressing estrogen receptor / progesterone receptor ( ER / PR ) or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( Her2 ) proteins , respectively . The immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) classification provides both therapeutic and prognostic information . In this study breast cancer is classified into four groups based on IHC profile ER / PR and Her2 / neu expression , positive ( + ) and / or negative ( - ) . The groups are : • ER / PR + , Her2 + = ER + / PR + , Her2 + ; ER - / PR + , Her2 + ; ER + / PR - , Her2 + O Onitilo et al . doi : 10 . 3121 / cmr . 2009 . 825 Breast Cancer Subtypes Page 4 • ER / PR + , Her2 - = ER + / PR + , Her2 - ; ER - / PR + , Her2 - ; ER + / PR - , Her2 - • ER / PR - , Her2 + = ER - / PR - , Her2 + • ER / PR - , Her2 - = ER - / PR - , Her2 - The IHC classification correlates well with intrinsic gene expression microarray categorization : ER / PR + , Her2 + with Luminal B ; ER / PR + , Her2 – with Luminal A ; ER / PR - , Her2 + and ER / PR - , Her2 – with triple negative / basal - like tumors . 1 Apart from lending itself to subtype analyses of tumor when fresh tissue is not available , the IHC classification has prognostic and therapeutic implications , is inexpensive and readily available . SUBJECTS AND METHODS Study Population Female subjects ≥ 18 years of age with invasive primary breast cancer ( stage I - III ) were electronically extracted from Marshfield Clinic / St . Joseph’s Hospital Cancer Registry using ICD - O - 3 codes C50 . 0 - C50 . 9 with first date of diagnosis between January 1 , 1998 and June 30 , 2005 . Marshfield Clinic is a large multi - specialty , multi - site group practice located throughout central and northern Wisconsin , partnered with St . Joseph’s Hospital in Marshfield . Racial representation in the cancer registry during that time period was 97 . 43 % White ; 1 . 59 % unknown ; 0 . 33 % American Indian , Aleutian , Eskimo ; 0 . 25 % Asian Indian , Pakistani ; and 0 . 04 % Black . The cancer registry identified 1767 breast cancer subjects of which 21 without follow - up data and 612 without ER / PR or Her2 data were excluded . Missing IHC results are attributable to the fact that Her2 neu testing was not common in the 1990s and early 2000s . It was not until late 2006 that the American Society of Clinical Oncology / College of American Pathologists Onitilo et al . doi : 10 . 3121 / cmr . 2009 . 825 Breast Cancer Subtypes Page 5 recommended that HER2 testing be routinely performed in patients with a new diagnosis of invasive breast cancer . 12 Data Collection Approved by the Marshfield Clinic Institutional Review Board , Marshfield Clinic / St . Joseph’s Hospital Cancer Registry was queried from January 1 , 1998 to June 30 , 2005 and provided the following data on each invasive breast cancer subject : age , gender , marital status , cancer site , tumor characteristics ( morphology , grade and size , ER / PR and Her2 expression ) , stage of cancer at diagnosis , nodal disease status and location , margin status , specifics of treatment ( doses , dates and duration of surgery , hormonal therapy , radiation , and chemotherapy ) , recurrence , date and location of recurrence , date and cause of death , and length of survival . Her2 neu expression not captured in registry reporting was abstracted as available from the medical record by investigators ( AAO and JME ) . Resources Marshfield Clinic / St . Joseph’s Hospital Cancer Registry Marshfield Clinic / St . Joseph’s Hospital Cancer Registry , initiated in 1960 , is accredited by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer and meets the Association of Community Cancer Center standards for cancer programs . Data from the cancer registry are submitted annually ( 1522 cases in 2005 ) to the National Cancer Database and the State of Wisconsin Cancer Reporting System . The registry has a 93 . 4 % 5 - year follow - up rate , and 89 . 8 % overall follow - up rate . Onitilo et al . doi : 10 . 3121 / cmr . 2009 . 825 Breast Cancer Subtypes Page 6 Marshfield Clinic Electronic Medical Record The Marshfield Clinic electronic medical record system is an extensive archive of medical information including a full electronic medical chart ; several enhanced clinical registries ; procedures , insurance claims and lab results ; and a file of more than 124 million patient diagnoses . A key feature of the electronic medical record system is the combined medical record which integrates data from all Marshfield Clinic facilities and affiliated hospitals . The combined medical record includes indices to all patient events and encounters within the Marshfield Clinic system of care , and can be accessed for all textual documentation such as office notes , operative reports and discharge summaries . The combined medical record also includes comprehensive lists of patient problems , diagnoses and procedures , current and past medication history , a variety of medication alerts , and online access to over a decade of laboratory and radiology results . Marshfield Laboratories Serving Marshfield Clinic and St . Joseph’s Hospital , Marshfield Laboratories is a reference laboratory where IHC are performed centrally by experienced technicians and a dedicated pathologist who follows strict sample handling , processing and reporting protocols , thus ensuring the reliability of IHC testing and results . ER / PR ER / PR results were obtained from the cancer registry having been processed in Marshfield Laboratories . The ER assay clone used was 1D5 , the PR assay clone was PgR636 and the detection system was a polymer . IHC staining permits the detection and localization of ER / PR within sections from formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded tissues . Staining of > 20 % of tumor cell Onitilo et al . doi : 10 . 3121 / cmr . 2009 . 825 Breast Cancer Subtypes Page 7 nuclei is considered positive . Staining of 5 % to 19 % of tumor cell nuclei is considered borderline . Staining of < 5 % of tumor cell nuclei is considered negative ( table 1 ) . For the purpose of the study both borderline and overtly positive results were considered positive . Her2 neu Her2 neu results were obtained from the cancer registry as available or from the medical record . The clone used was a polyclonal ( Her2 HercepTest Kit ) and the detection system used was a polymer . The Food and Drug Administration has approved the reagents used in this IHC assay for assessment of Her2 receptor status . Marshfield Laboratories considers a test result of 0 to 1 + as negative and 3 + as positive . For the current study a Her2 neu result of 2 + is considered a negative result unless verified by fluorescent in - situ hybridization ( FISH ) ( table 1 ) . Fifty cases from the study were sent to Mayo Medical Laboratories where FISH was performed with evidence of Her2 neu gene amplification in 11 of the cases ( 18 % ) ; thus , they are considered Her2 positive . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Differences in subjects and tumor characteristics between the various breast cancer subtypes were analyzed using analysis of variance for continuous variables and chi - square test for categorical variables . The Kaplan - Meier product limit method was used to estimate the overall and disease - free survival . Ninety - five percent confidence intervals ( CI ) for the percentage surviving at a particular time were estimated using the logit transformation . Overall survival was measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of death from any cause . Disease - free survival was measured from the date of first definitive treatment to the date of first relapse or death from Onitilo et al . doi : 10 . 3121 / cmr . 2009 . 825 Breast Cancer Subtypes Page 8 any cause . Survival times were censored at the dates of last contact for subjects who were lost to follow - up . Each breast cancer subtype was compared with the most common reference group of ER / PR + , Her2 - subtype . Cox - proportional hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratios and 95 % CI for overall and disease - free survival between the breast cancer subtypes adjusting for age , lymph node status and disease stage . S - plus statistical software was used for survival analysis and SAS 9 . 1 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC , USA ) was used for all other analyses . A P - value of < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . RESULTS Final analysis included 1134 invasive breast cancer subjects identified in the Marshfield Clinic / St . Joseph’s Hospital Cancer Registry from January 1 , 1998 to June 30 , 2005 . The mean age of all subjects was 62 . 7 years ( SD , 13 . 8 ; range , 27 . 9 to 95 . 8 years ) . Baseline characteristics of subjects including tumor subtype are presented in table 2 . Of 1134 subjects , 116 ( 10 . 2 % ) were ER / PR + , Her2 + , 781 ( 68 . 9 % ) were ER / PR + , Her2 - , 85 ( 7 . 5 % ) were ER / PR - , Her2 + , and the remaining 152 ( 13 . 4 % ) were classified as triple negative ( table 2 ) . Differences in baseline characteristics between the four subtypes are presented in table 3 . Subjects with ER / PR + , Her2 - subtype were more likely to be older ( P < 0 . 001 ) , have early stage breast cancer ( P < 0 . 001 ) , present with small tumor ( P < 0 . 001 ) and have a well / moderately differentiated histological grade ( P < 0 . 001 ) . They were less likely to be lymph node positive ( P < 0 . 001 ) , have a lobular tumor type ( P < 0 . 001 ) , and be treated with chemotherapy ( P < 0 . 001 ) . Onitilo et al . doi : 10 . 3121 / cmr . 2009 . 825 Breast Cancer Subtypes Page 9 Ninety - nine subjects ( 8 . 7 % ) had recurrence and 140 ( 12 . 3 % ) died during the follow - up period . The estimated median follow - up period for all subjects was 4 . 8 years ( range , 3 . 2 months to 9 . 4 years ) . The 5 - year overall survival for all subjects was 87 . 8 % ( 95 % CI , 85 . 4 - 89 . 9 ) and the disease - free survival was 83 . 1 % ( 95 % CI , 80 . 5 - 85 . 5 ) . The 5 - year overall and disease - free survival by tumor subtype , ER / PR status and Her2 status is presented in table 4 . Of the 99 subjects with recurrence , 45 ( 45 . 5 % ) had local recurrence and the remaining had recurrences in bone ( 39 . 4 % ) , liver ( 22 . 2 % ) , lung ( 15 . 1 % ) , mediastinal lymph nodes ( 10 . 1 % ) , brain ( 7 . 1 % ) and other sites ( 11 . 1 % ) ( table 5 ) . The age adjusted odds ratio for tumor characteristics associated with various subtype are presented in table 6 . The Kaplan - Meier curve for overall and disease - free survival by tumor subtype is shown in figure 1 . In the Cox regression analysis , subjects with the triple negative subtype , ER / PR - , Her2 - had the worst overall survival ( hazard ratio , 1 . 8 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 0 - 3 . 0 ) and worst disease - free survival ( hazard ratio , 1 . 5 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 8 - 3 . 0 ) when compared with subjects with ER / PR + , Her2 - subtype ( table 7 ) . Adjustment was made for age , stage , histological grade , chemotherapy treatment and lymph node status ( table 7 ) . Among the 781 subjects with ER / PR + , Her2 - subtype , 524 received no chemotherapy and 257 received chemotherapy . Those who received chemotherapy had significantly better overall ( hazard ratio , 0 . 45 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 26 - 0 . 77 ; P = 0 . 004 ) and disease - free ( hazard ratio , 54 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 34 - 0 . 86 ; P = 0 . 009 ) survival benefits when compared with subjects who did not receive chemotherapy . No significant differences in overall and disease - free survival benefits were Onitilo et al . doi : 10 . 3121 / cmr . 2009 . 825 Breast Cancer Subtypes Page 10 observed in other subtypes . This may be due to the small number of subjects in the other subtype groups . DISCUSSION This study confirmed breast cancer as a multifaceted disease comprised of distinct biological subtypes with diverse natural history which are increasingly recognized as presenting a varied spectrum of clinical , pathologic , and molecular features with different prognostic and therapeutic implications . 3 Our results reveal statistically significant differences in clinical and pathologic features and outcomes between subtypes . Using the most common subtype ( ER / PR + , Her2 - ) as a reference , the triple negative subtype ( ER / PR - , Her2 - ) had worst overall survival ( hazard ratio , 1 . 8 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 06 - 3 . 2 ) , and worst disease - free survival ( hazard ratio , 1 . 5 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 8 - 3 . 0 ) . . These expected survival differences have meaningful implications for communication and care decisions between providers and their cancer patients . This subclassification should , however , be complemented with the many other important traditional prognostic variables for the individual such as age , tumor size , lymph node status , comorbidity , and adjuvant therapy . IHC - based classification of both ER / PR and Her2 status provides prognostic and therapeutic information not achievable from either alone . Prior classifications separating breast cancer into one of two categories based on ER expression alone is less discriminatory in terms of prognosis , and the additional subclassification based on Her2 expression provides enhanced and important therapeutic guidance . Breast cancer has also sometimes been dichotomized into triple negativity or other . 13 This classification is informative but simplistic and may be misleading by grouping the ER / PR - , Her2 + with ER / PR + , Her2 + and ER / PR + , Her2 – . This was borne out in our results , Onitilo et al . doi : 10 . 3121 / cmr . 2009 . 825 Breast Cancer Subtypes Page 11 where the ER / PR + , Her2 + had statistically equivalent survival to the referent ER / PR + , Her2 – subtype , and in practice , both types have better prognostic and therapeutic connotations . However , the ER / PR - , Her2 + point estimates were more similar to the triple negative values . Also , recent studies have suggested that within the ER / PR + subtypes , the clinical and pathologic response to chemotherapy varies with the ER / PR + , Her2 + subtype defined by both hormone receptor and Her2 expression showing better response to chemotherapy . 13 ER / PR + , Her2 + tumors virtually always have a high recurrence score . 14 Recently it was shown in a retrospective analysis that ER / PR + , Her2 - tumor may benefit less from taxanes in the adjuvant setting . 15 We have classified breast cancer using IHC into 4 global subtypes out of the 8 possible subtypes commonly used by other authors . 16 We believe this classification is practical , simple , informative , clinically useful , and quite discriminative between the subtypes . The other four groups will emerge if we differentiate based on PR expression ( ER + / PR + vs . ER + / PR - tumors ) . The independent prognostive and predictive role of PR expression irrespective of ER has been a subject of great controversy as demonstrated by the report from the ATAC ( Arimidex , Tamoxifen , Alone or in Combination ) adjuvant trial , a large worldwide trial comparing the efficacy of tamoxifen with that of the aromatase inhibitor anastrazole , showing overall that patients with ER + / PR + tumors had a lower recurrence rate than those with ER + / PR - tumors . 17 The observation from the same study that patients with ER + / PR - tumors respond nearly as well to anastrozole as those with ER + / PR + tumors suggests that the ER signaling pathway is functional in many ER + / PR - tumors , consistent with the well - known fact that the PR gene is regulated by the estrogen pathway . 17 Also , the relative resistance by ER + / PR - tumors was not Onitilo et al . doi : 10 . 3121 / cmr . 2009 . 825 Breast Cancer Subtypes Page 12 observed in the BIG 1 - 98 trial which is the largest study of an aromatase inhibitor as up - front adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer . 18 Studies that have been classified as using more than 4 subtypes are plagued by these controversies and those inherent in small sample size and multiplicity of variables . 19 , 20 Recent publications have shown that newer molecular classification of breast cancer also has important prognostic value . Subtyping breast cancer using microarrays for gene expression analysis is the best way to perform such molecular classification . However , most archived clinical specimens are not amenable to such analysis . Moreover , until recently when Oncotype DX and MammaPrint became commercially available , such assays were limited to research laboratories and therefore not optimally available for commonplace clinical practice . The IHC - based classification systems are still useful in clinical practice , especially when fresh tissue is not available , and has been shown to correlate well with intrinsic classification using gene expression microarrays : ER / PR + , Her2 + with Luminal B ; ER / PR + , Her2 – with Luminal A ; ER / PR - , Her2 + ( ER - / Her2 + ) ; and ER / PR - , Her2 – with triple negative / basal - like tumors . 3 , 13 It is worth noting that the reliability of the ER / PR and Her2 testing is imperfect . There is substantial intralaboratory and interlaboratory variation in ER results because fixation , antigen retrieval , and staining methods may differ among laboratories . 21 - 23 Substantial discordance among Her2 results generated in different laboratories from the same specimen has also been reported . 12 , 21 , 24 For this classification to be more helpful , ongoing efforts 12 should also be directed at standardization of current testing and development of more reliable and reproducible testing for ER / PR and Her2 / neu expression . 12 , 21 - 24 Onitilo et al . doi : 10 . 3121 / cmr . 2009 . 825 Breast Cancer Subtypes Page 13 In our current analysis we have not considered the semi - quantitative information from IHC in terms of ER / PR or Her2 levels of expression on clinical outcomes largely because we do not have adequate sample for such analysis . We believe such subsetting within the subtypes may be unreliable with regards to the message highlighted in this study due to inadequate sample size . This study of a predominantly Caucasian population reports the distribution of subtypes as different from that seen in a predominantly African American population where ER / PR – , Her2 - is more prevalent ( 39 % premenopausal versus 14 % postmenopausal African American women versus 16 % non - African American women of all ages ) . 3 Also of note , 80 % of our subjects are ER + accounting in part for the overall 5 - year survival of 87 . 8 % ( 95 % CI , 85 . 4 - 89 . 9 ) and 5 - year disease - free survival of 83 . 1 % ( 95 % CI , 80 . 5 - 85 . 5 ) . A large percentage of our patients demonstrate favorable features such as small tumor size ( < 2 cm ; 71 % ) , negative nodal status ( 61 % ) , and low to moderate histologic grade ( 59 % ) . An investigation of all subgroups showed benefit from chemotherapy , but after controlling for age , tumor size , and lymph node status , the sample size was not sufficient to make a strong assertion except in the ER / PR + , Her2 - subgroup . In the ER / PR + , Her2 - subgroup ( 781 subjects ) , 524 patients did not receive chemotherapy and 257 patients did receive chemotherapy . Chemotherapy conferred overall and disease - free survival advantages ( P = 0 . 003 and 0 . 009 , respectively ) . This study supports other studies 3 , 13 , 25 which have shown both the triple negative and Her2 + / ER - subtypes to have poorer clinical , pathologic , and molecular prognoses . The triple negative group Onitilo et al . doi : 10 . 3121 / cmr . 2009 . 825 Breast Cancer Subtypes Page 14 has the worst overall and disease - free survival . For the triple negative group the disease - free survival curve tends to plateau after the second and third year , but the curve continues downward for the Her2 + / ER - . In 2008 , tumor - expressed proteins , such as ER and Her2 , play an increasingly important role in determining breast cancer treatment . For example , women with ER + breast cancer typically receive endocrine therapy ( tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors ) and women with Her2 + breast cancer may receive anti - Her2 ( trastuzumab [ Herceptin ] and lapatinib [ Tykerb ] ) . It is reasonable to assume that trastuzumab and lapatinib will shift the Her2 + curve upward ( Her2 + / ER - ) . We lack targeted therapies for triple negative breast cancer and this continues to direct the focus of ongoing research . 26 - 28 Despite the enormous effort and funding channeled towards molecular diagnostics , there is still relevance for IHC , especially when performed by inexperienced centers . Although molecular arrays have been around for approximately a decade , new therapy target proteins are not being identified , thus the predictive value of the assays are relatively global or limited to known targets such as ER / PR protein or the Her2 gene . Also , despite multiple and different gene sets used in most of the molecular testing , there is significant agreement in the outcome predictions for individual patients by these tests , 14 suggesting that they are probably tracking a common set of biologic phenotypes which are heavily weighted toward ER / PR and Her2 gene pathways . Finally , the superiority of molecular technology over IHC testing is theoretical and based on the premise that molecular technology provides quantization and reproducibility . This presumptive theory is the basis for some ongoing studies but is yet to be proven . Onitilo et al . doi : 10 . 3121 / cmr . 2009 . 825 Breast Cancer Subtypes Page 15 CONCLUSIONS Our study showed the triple negative subtype ( ER / PR - , Her2 - ) has the worst overall and disease - free survival compared to the other subtypes . Further confirmatory studies are necessary to refine IHC classification . We support IHC classification as a clinical tool as ER / PR and Her2 - testing is widely available at a reasonable cost , is a clinically - used therapeutically informative classification of breast cancer based on immunophenotype / biologic phenotypes , and is prognostic as well as somewhat predictive . Additional ongoing efforts 12 should be directed at standardization of current testing methods and development of more reliable and reproducible testing .
