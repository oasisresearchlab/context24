Design / methodology / approach – This study is based on the analysis of 168 university documents regarding the cash - per - publication reward policy at 100 Chinese universities . Findings – Chinese universities offer cash rewards from 30 to 165 , 000 USD for papers published in journals indexed by Web of Science ( WoS ) , and the average reward amount has been increasing for the past 10 years . Originality / value – The cash - per - publication reward policy in China has never been systematically studied and investigated before except for in some case studies . This is the first paper that reveals the landscape of the cash - per - publication reward policy in China . Keywords China , monetary reward , cash - per - publication , Chinese university , journal publication , Web of Science Paper type Research paper Introduction Although monetary rewards have been used for recognizing scientific achievement since the eighteen century , it is not regarded as the major reward system in science ( Robert King Merton , 1973 ) , in which scientists try to publish their works and receive the recognition of their peers as the reward . Since academic prizes consisting of cash rewards are awarded only to very few scientific elites , they are considered as the metaphors of prestige rather than simply large sums of money ( Zuckerman , 1992 ) . However , the reward system in science changed when the monetary reward incentive for publication was introduced in 1980s . It is reported that this incentive can promote research productivity ( Franzoni , Scellato , & Stephan , 2011 ) but might create a negative goal displacement effect ( Frey , Osterloh , & Homberg , 2013 ; Osterloh & Frey , 2014 ) . Since the early 1990s , Chinese research institutions have initiated the cash - per - publication reward polices in which Chinese scholars could get cash for each eligible publication . The purpose of publishing their works is not only to advance knowledge and win recognition , but also to earn cash ( Sun & Zhang , 2010 ; L . Wang , 2016 ) . Since these cash - per - publication reward policies vary by institution and some policies are internal or confidential , they have never been systematically investigated except for in some case studies . The purpose of this study is to present the landscape of the cash - per - publication reward policy in China 1 and reveal its trend since the late 1990s . China’s Scientific Activity With the significant development of China’s economy , China’s scientific activity is experiencing a period of rapid growth . As Figure 1 shows , China’s scientific research inputs and outputs have exhibited a consistent growth pattern over the past 20 years ; from 1995 to 2013 , China’s expenditures on Research and Development ( R & D ) increased almost 33 times from 5 . 23 billion USD 2 to 177 . 70 billion USD , while its number of international publications ( indexed by Web of Science ) increased about 17 times from 13 , 134 to 232 , 070 ( National Bureau of Statistics of China , 1996 - 2014 ) . Indeed , China , the second largest share of international scientific production per country since 2009 , contributes 16 . 3 % of scientific articles indexed by Web of Science ( hereafter referred to as WoS ) ( Institute of Scientific and Technical Information of China , 2016 ) . Figure 1 Research Inputs and Outputs in China ( 1995 - 2013 ) Universities in China In China , although the universities , the research institutions , the enterprises , the hospitals not affiliated with universities , and other sectors are all involved in scientific activity , the universities play the dominant role in China’s scientific research output , contributing 82 . 8 % of monographs and 73 . 4 % of journal articles , including 83 . 0 % of WoS papers ( National Bureau of Statistics of China , 2015 ) . There are 2 , 595 higher education institutions in China , including 1 , 236 universities offering undergraduate programs ( Ministry of Education of China , 2016 ) . 1 In this study , China refers to the mainland China , which is the geopolitical area under the direct jurisdiction of the People ' s Republic of China excluding Hong Kong and Macau . 2 In this study , all cash values in Chinese Yuan ( CNY ) were converted to US dollar ( USD ) at the rate 1 CNY = 0 . 15 USD . The exchange rate was retrieved from xe . com on Oct . 3 , 2016 . Traditionally these universities vary by ownership , speciality , and region ; however , they also can be classified into three tiers by two national research programs : Project 211 and Project 985 . Project 211 was initiated in 1995 by China’s Ministry of Education . The objective of this project was to construct 100 world - class universities in the beginning of the twenty - first century ( Ministry of Education of China , 2000 ) . The Chinese government offers preferential policies and financial support to designated universities who are admitted to this project , and has contributed around 2 . 7 billion USD to it ( Tang & Yang , 2008 ) . Eventually , 116 universities were admitted to Project 211 , forming an elite group of universities occupying 70 % of national research funding and supervising 80 % of doctoral students ( Tang & Yang , 2008 ) . Today , 112 universities are still included in Project 211 , even after 4 universities merged . Project 985 was first announced by Zemin Jiang , former Chairman of the People’s Republic of China , on May 4 , 1998 to promote the development of a Chinese equivalent of the US Ivy League ( Chen , 2006 ) . This Chinese Ivy League started with 9 universities in 2009 and accepted another 30 universities in the following two years . These 39 universities are all Project 211 universities , but receive more government funding than other Project 211 universities ( Mohrman , 2005 ) . Both Project 985 and Project 211 ceased admission in 2011 , grouping Chinese universities into a 3 - tier pyramid hierarchy as shown in Figure 2 : 39 universities within Project 985 ( hereafter referred to as Tier 1 universities ) , 73 universities within Project 211 but excluded from Project 985 ( hereafter referred to as Tier 2 universities ) , and 1 , 124 other universities ( hereafter referred to as Tier 3 universities ) . Figure 2 The Pyramid Hierarchy of Chinese Universities To construct world - class universities , the Chinese government differentiates universities and allocates most funding to a few elite universities , which lead to the “ Matthew Effect ” among Chinese universities . Figure 3 presents a huge gap between the elite ( Tier 1 and Tier 2 ) and ordinary ( Tier 3 ) universities in terms of their average annual budgets . From 2002 to 2015 , the average annual budget of Tier 1 and Tier 2 universities increased from 23 . 86 million USD to 113 . 05 million USD while the mean budget of Tier 3 universities increased from 1 . 89 million USD to 9 . 2 7 million USD . Tier 1 and Tier 2 universities’ budget is , on average , 12 times more than Tier 3 universities budget at all times ( Ministry of Education of China , 2003 - 2016 ) . Although a new national research program , “Double World - Class” , was announced by the Chinese government in 2016 , it was not in effect during the period of our investigation . Figure 3 Comparison of Average University Budget between Elite Universities and Ordinary Universities ( 2002 - 2014 ) The Cash - per - publication Reward Policy in China Since the 1980s , to increase the international visibility of Chinese research , the number of WoS papers has been used to evaluate the research performance in China of both institutions and individuals ( Gong & Qu , 2010 ) . Chinese scholars are required to publish WoS papers to attain promotion , while their affiliated institutions need the number of WoS papers for ranking and funding application ( Y . Wang & Li , 2015 ) . Chinese universities and research institutions also offer preferential policies and monetary rewards to encourage their scholars to publish in journals indexed by WoS ( Peng , 2011 ) . The first cash - per - publication reward policy ( hereafter referred to as the cash reward policy ) was launched by the Department of Physics at Nanjing University around 1990 . Initially , scholars received 25 USD for each WoS paper , and the amount increased to between 60 and 120 USD in the mid - 1990s ( Swinbanks , Nathan , & Triendl , 1997 ) . As the first to apply the WoS to research evaluation , Nanjing University topped the list of Chinese universities publishing most WoS papers seven years in a row in the 1990s ( Gong & Qu , 2010 ) ; its research evaluation policy and cash reward policy were then copied by other universities and research institutions . Today , every university and research institution in China has established their own cash reward policies . Regional Difference in China China consists of 31 provincial - level divisions that were traditionally grouped into seven geographical regions : North , Northeast , Northwest , Center , East , Southwest , and South . Economic development in different regions differs significantly . The GDP per capita in the developed regions ( i . e . the North , Northeast , East and South ) are much higher than those in the developing regions ( i . e . the Northwest , Center , and Southwest ) as shown in Table 1 . Since Chinese universities are financially supported by not only the central government but also the local government , regional difference in economic development may lead to differences in the financial capacities of Chinese universities from different regions . Universities in developed regions may have adequate budgets , offering greater monetary reward compared to universities in developing regions . As Table 1 indicates , the average university budgets in the developed regions are much higher than those in the developing regions .

Literature Review Reward System of Science Robert King Merton ( 1973 ) presents the sociology of science with a rewards system and recognition model . He states that science could be regarded as a social institution , with values , norms , and organization ( Robert King Merton , 1957 , 1973 ) . This institution can reward its members ( scientists ) for their performance . Members also would like to present their achievements in order to get the rewards ( Robert King Merton , 1957 ) . Robert King Merton ( 1973 ) also points out that rewards for scientific achievement can be given only if others recognize it . As a result , scientists are eager to publish their works ; peers read the publications and recognize their achievements by citing or acknowledging them in their own works . Based on Merton’s recognition model ( Robert King Merton , 1973 ) , the reward system of science is also described as a reward triangle consisting of authorship , citations , and acknowledgements ( Cronin & Weaver - Wozniak , 1993 ) . Previous studies suggest that other forms of recognition i n addition to the “reward triangle” should be added to the reward system of science . Blume and Sinclair ( 1973 ) point out that academic prizes , honorary fellowships , and service on academic committees should be recognized as academic achievement . Sugimoto , Russell , Meho , and Marchionini ( 2008 ) compare citation counts and academic mentoring impact , and indicate that academic mentorship should also be granted recognition for its contribution to the spread of knowledge . As social media and other forms of dissemination are being incorporated into scientific practices , a multifaceted reward system has been identified that includes social media mentions , readership counts , and so on ( Desrochers et al . , 2015 ) . Academic Monetary Rewards in History In 1719 , the first academic prize was initiated by Académie des Sciences in France to award scientists who contribute to the advancement of knowledge in Astronomy . Thereafter , some academic prizes , with or without cash incentives , were introduced by Académie des Sciences and Royal Society of London to reward new scientific findings or past accomplishments . The establishment of The Nobel Prize , the largest monetary prize in the academic world , turned the academic prize into a metaphor for accomplishment and prestige ( Zuckerman , 1977 ) . There are now various academic prizes with big monetary rewards recognizing academic achievement locally and internationally . These large awards reshape the reward system of science ’s upper reaches ( Zuckerman , 1992 ) . However , since these rich academic prizes are awarded only to very few outstanding scholars , they are valued on the basis of their representations of honors rather than their cash values ( Zuckerman , 1992 ) . In addition , Robert King Merton ( 1957 ) even claims that winning the monetary reward should not be the main purpose of any scientific activity because it may break the norm of disinterestedness , referring to rewards for action unaffected by self - interest . He states that : Like other institutions also , science has its system of allocating rewards for performance of roles . These rewards are largely honorific , since even today , when science is largely professionalized ; the pursuit of science is culturally defined as being primarily a disinterested search for truth and only secondarily a means of earning a livelihood . ( Robert King Merton , 1957 , p . 659 ) In 1986 , the UK adopted the Research Assessment Exercise ( RAE ) , which allocates national funds to departments based on past performance and peer review . The monetary incentives to publish , regarded as a reform , spread over the world afterwards ; some countries even introduced a system of cash bonuses to individuals rather than institutions for each article published in top international scientific journals ( Franzoni et al . , 2011 ) . Indeed , the economic incentives affect the university research at both the institution ( Thursby , Jensen , & Thursby , 2001 ; Thursby & Thursby , 2002 ) and the individual levels ( Frey et al . , 2013 ; Osterloh & Frey , 2014 ) . The Monetary Reward in China As described above , the cash reward policy was launched in China to promote scientific productivity and publication . Through case studies , some Chinese scholars found that monetary rewards could increase scholars’ motivation and improve productivity in publishing WoS papers ( Z Li & Zhang , 2008 ; ZW Li & Zhong , 2013 ; Shan , Han , & Zhao , 2013 ; Zeng , An , & Wang , 2012 ) . However , no study compares the cash reward policies in different universities nor presents the landscape of the monetary reward for publications in China . Cash reward policies also create some negative effects . Chinese researchers may favour fast research that leads to quick , cashable publications as opposed to long - term research ; in essence , publishing in WoS journals can become the only research goal ( Jin & Rousseau , 2004 ) . Some Chinese scientists may resort to plagiarized or fabricated research , purchase ghostwritten papers , or sell authorship ( Hvistendahl , 2013 ; Qiu , 2010 ) . Monetary reward also amplifies the existing “Matthew Effect” among Chinese universities ( Zhong & Chen , 2008 ) . Compared with Tier 3 universities , Tier 1 and Tier 2 universities dominate scientific resources , and thus could offer more cash rewards for publications , motivating their scholars to produce more ( J . Li , 2013 ; Qi , 2009 ) . Since the monetary reward is an internal award , it is only announced by Chinese universities via internal documents . Some universities even keep it confidential to avoid competition from other universities . Although the cash reward policy has been applied for 20 years , we still know little about 1 ) the range of amounts paid to individuals for publications ; 2 ) if the cash award varies with the quality of journals ; 3 ) if the cash reward policy differs significantly from one university to another . The purpose of this study is to present the landscape of the cash - per - publication reward policy in China and address these questions . Please note that the scope of this study is limited to research in natural science , including engineering and medical science . Since social science and humanities have more localized interests in research and varied methods of disseminating knowledge , beyond journal publications , most Chinese universities have different systems for evaluating and awarding research performance in social science and the humanities . For Chinese scholars in social science and humanities , there are additional approaches to winning cash rewards , such as publishing articles in domestic journals or publishing monographs . On the other hand , the cash rewards are only applied to publications in WoS journals in natural science . Methodology Data Collection In order to present the landscape of the cash - per - publication reward policy in China , we sampled 100 Chinese universities and investigated their cash reward policies since the 1990s . Both stratified sampling and convenience sampling were used . First , considering the 3 - tier pyramid hierarchy of Chinese universities and regional differences , we classified all 1 , 236 Chinese universities into 21 categories by tiers and regions . Second , we tried to retrieve the cash reward policies from universities in each category to ensure that the sample is representative . Since most cash reward policies are recorded in internal documents that may not be externally accessible , we had to select universities from each category based on data availability . We used the Chinese search engine Baidu to locate such information and retrieved it from the official websites of each selected university 3 . Finally , a manual validation was conducted to ensure that the retrieved documents were official and valid . As Table 2 shows , 100 Chinese universities were selected for the investigation : 25 universities in Tier 1 , 33 universities in Tier 2 , and 42 universities in Tier 3 . The samples also represent Chinese universities from all seven regions in China , as discussed above . Since some Chinese universities had multiple cash reward policies ( e . g . , modified or new ones ) , two or more cash reward policies were found in some universities during the period of the investigation . Eventually , 168 cash reward policies were retrieved from these 100 universities . 45 universities contributed one policy each , while 45 universities contributed two ; Zhejiang University and Guizhou Normal University issued five and four cash reward policies , respectively , while 8 universities contributed three each . The first cash reward policy that we found was issued in 1999 ; the number of cash reward policies increased afterwards and reached its peak of 21 in 2015 . Eight policies were even issued in 2016 as we started this investigation .

Due to limited data availability , we did not use random sampling for our data collection , which is a limitation for this study . When comparing the science and technology personnel ( S & T personnel ) , number of international publications , research funding received , and the number of graduate students between the sample and the population ( see Table 3 ) , we found that the means of these indicators from the sample Tier 1 universities were very close to those means from all Tier 1 universities , while the means from the sample Tier 2 universities were only a little higher than the means from all Tier 2 universities . The Tier 3 sample seemed to include many top Tier 3 universities so that the sample means were much higher than the average of all Tier 3 universities . We also did the one - sample T - test ( α = 0 . 05 ) comparing the sample means with the population means to test whether the samples are representative . As Table 3 shows , we did not find any significant difference between sample and population in all four indicators in Tier 1 and Tier 2 and one indicator ( S & T personnel ) in Tier 3 ; significant difference was found between the Tier 3 sample and population in terms of the number of international publications , the research funding received , and the number of graduate . The T - test indicated that the Tier 1 3 Some internal documents or information regarding the cash reward policies were provided privately by university staff . and Tier 2 samples represented the population well while the Tier 3 sample was a little weak in this study .

For example , 0 % means that no significant difference between the sample mean and population mean while 30 . 9 % means that the mean difference is equal to 30 . 9 % of the population mean . Data Analysis Each cash reward policy contains various specifications about its criteria for the eligibility , amount , formula for calculation , and method of payment . It was difficult to compare different cash reward policies with different specifications . In order to compare the cash reward policies issued by different universities in different years , we selected some journals as examples and calculated the amounts of cash reward for a single research paper published in these journals according to different cash reward policies . The selected journals represent journals with different Journal Impact Factors ( JIFs ) and in different Journal Citation Report ( JCR ) Quartiles . For a good understanding of the comparison , we selected a list of nine popular journals that could be recognized by our readers , including four multidisciplinary science journals ( the first 4 ) and five library and information science journals ( the last 5 ) as shown in Table 4 . Table 4 List of Journals Selected for the Comparison Journal Impact Factor ( 5 - year ) JCR Quartile ( modified ) Nature 41 . 458 Q1 Science 34 . 921 Q1 Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) 10 . 285 Q1 PLOS One 3 . 535 Q3 MIS Quarterly 9 . 510 Q1 Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology ( JASIST ) 2 . 762 Q1 Journal of Documentation 1 . 480 Q2 Library Hi Tech 0 . 741 Q3 International Journal of Library and Information Science ( LIBRI ) 0 . 469 Q4 Source : Journal Citation Report 2015 Both the Journal Impact Factor ( JIF ) of selected journals and the Journal Citation Report ( JCR ) Quartile in which these journals are located were used to calculate the amount of cash reward in most cash reward policies . Please note that we chose 5 - year JIF instead of 2 - year JIF because the former was used frequently by Chinese universities . Also , the JCR Quartile applied to the cash reward policies is not the original one with four equal quarters , but a modified one made by the Chinese Academy of Sciences . Compared to the original JCR Quartile grouping journals in each discipline into four equal quarters , the modified JCR Quartile use a pyramid hierarchy instead : only the top 5 % of journals in each discipline are grouped into the Q1 while journals ranked in 5 - 20 % , 20 - 50 % and the bottom 50 % are grouped into Q2 , Q3 and Q4 in the modified JCR Quartile , respectively . Results A landscape of the cash - per - publication reward policy in China emerged as all 168 cash reward policies were analyzed . Chinese universities offer cash rewards that range from 30 to 165 , 000 USD for a single paper published in journals indexed by WoS , and the average reward amount has been increasing for the past 10 years . The results show us the overview of the cash - per - publication reward policies in terms of eligibility , amount , and their diversity and trends . Eligibility and Method WoS , which includes the Science Citation Index Expanded ( SCIE ) , the Social Science Citation Index ( SSCI ) , the Arts and Humanities Citation Index ( AHCI ) and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index ( CPCI ) , plays a crucial role in China’s cash reward policies . WoS data and the Journal Citation Report ( JCR ) are used as the eligibility criteria and the grade of the cash reward . Among all cash reward policies , only WoS papers are eligible for the cash reward , except that some universities offer small cash awards to papers indexed by Engineering Index ( EI ) 4 ; WoS papers published in different journals may be awarded different amounts according to the journal’s JIR and JCR quartile . Based on the analysis of these 168 cash reward policies , we grouped them into the following four major categories : 1 . One - price reward ( 31 ) : Universities pay the same amount to all WoS papers regardless of where these papers are published . 2 . Original JIF - based reward ( 49 ) : Universities award eligible papers different amounts based on the JIF of the journals in which these papers are published . Some universities assigned different grades to eligible journals on the basis of their JIF and pay more for papers published in journals with a high grade ; some universities use 4 Engineering Index is an engineering bibliographic database published by Elsevier . It indexes scientific literature pertaining to engineering materials . the JIF as the multiplier to differentiate the cash reward ( e . g . the amount of cash reward is equal to a basic amount times the JIF ) . 3 . JCR Quartiles - based reward ( 99 ) 5 : Universities award eligible papers different amounts based on the modified JCR Quartile of the journals provided by Chinese Academy of Science that these papers published . 4 . Citation - based reward ( 15 ) : Universities award papers on the basis of the number of citations they received in a given citation window 6 . Some universities set up a threshold of the number of citations and award papers over the threshold ; some universities use the Essential Science Indicators ( ESI ) ( e . g . , hot paper and highly cited paper ) as the threshold and award these papers . Among these 168 cash reward policies , we found 31 , 49 , 99 , and 15 policies that fell into these four categories , respectively . These numbers sum to over 168 because some cash reward policies were grouped into more than one category when universities apply multiple methods to awarding their international publications . We also found trends in the cash reward policies in effect in the following three stages from the late 1990s onwards , as shown in Figure 4 . Both the one - price reward policies and the Original JIF - based reward policies were popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s , but their shares decreased when the JCR Quartile based policy was introduced . Since 2005 , more and more Chinese universities have adopted the JCR Quartile based policy , which became the dominant policy from 2013 onwards . Figure 4 Share of the Cash Reward Policies in Effect by Category ( 1999 - 2016 ) 5 Although the JCR Quartile is also based on the JIF , JCR Quartile provides a structural hierarchy that groups all journals into 4 categories , which the original JIF - based method does not . 6 The citation window varies in different universities ; some universities use a 5 - year citation window while other universities use a 3 - year citation window ; some universities even count the citations at any time . 0 % 10 % 20 % 30 % 40 % 50 % 60 % 70 % 80 % 90 % 100 % 199920002001200220032004200520062007200820092010201120122013201420152016 JCR Quartile - based JIF - based One Price Citation - based Authorship The amount of individual cash rewards per WoS paper varies from 30 USD to 165 , 000 USD . Not all authors of a paper can claim cash rewards . In 118 out of 168 cash reward policies , universities only award cash to the first author ; some universities even require that the awarded author must be both the first author and the corresponding author in 22 out of these 118 policies . Among 25 exceptional policies , universities award cash to non - first authors whose papers were published in particular prestigious journals ( e . g . , Nature , Science ) . Only 13 policies indicate that non - first authors may be awarded for all eligible publications , as they could get a discounted amount ( e . g . , half for the second author , a quarter for the third , etc . ) . In addition , there is no specific requirement for authorship in 12 out of 168 policies . Amount of the Cash Reward After analyzing 75 policies from 40 Chinese universities 7 that had the cash reward policy in effect between 2008 and 2016 , we inferred a cash reward policy by calculating the average cash award for papers published in nine selected journals as described above . We also found that Chinese universities increased the amount of cash reward on average between 2008 and 2016 as shown in Table 5 . 1 . Nature , Science : Among most cash reward policies , publishing a paper in these two prestigious journals 8 would receive special treatment . Chinese universities offer the highest cash reward to Nature or Science papers . The author ( s ) may receive a prize up to 165 , 000 USD ; some universities even announced that the amount of cash rewarded for a Nature or Science paper was negotiable . Indeed , the average amount of cash award for a Nature or Science paper increased 67 % from 26 , 212 USD in 2008 to 43 , 783 USD in 2016 . 2 . PNAS : Although Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences is also a prestigious journal , it is not recognized by Chinese universities for special treatment . However , based on its JIF and JCR Quartile ranking , the average cash award for a PNAS paper is more than 3 , 000 USD , increasing slightly from 3 , 156 USD in 2008 to 3 , 513 USD in 2016 . 3 . PLOS ONE : Although PLOS ONE is ranked as a Q1 journal in the original JCR Quartile , it is categorized as a Q3 journal by the modified version of JCR provided by the Chinese Academy of Science . As a result , the amount awarded to a PLOS ONE paper is only around 1 , 000 USD , and this even declined from 1 , 096 USD in 2008 to 984 USD in 2016 . 4 . MIS Quarterly , JASIST : Both journals are ranked as Q1 journals in their category ( Library and Information Science ) by JCR . MIS Quarterly ’s JIF is higher than JASIST ’s , 7 In order to keep the analysis consistent , 60 universities were excluded because their first cash reward policies were issued in 2009 and after . 8 Some Chinese universities add Cell to this list of prestige journals ; but most universities only recognize Nature and Science . although the latter is recognized as the top journal in Library and Information Science , and so the average amount of cash awarded for a MIS Quarterly article is higher than that for a JASIST paper . From 2008 to 2016 , the average amount of cash awarded for a MIS Quarterly paper slightly increased from 2 , 613 USD ( 2008 ) to 2 , 938 USD ( 2016 ) , while the average amount of cash award to a JASIST paper increased 43 % from 1 , 737 USD in 2008 to 2 , 488 USD in 2016 . 5 . Journal of Documentation : As a journal ranked Q2 by the JCR , the average amount cash award to a paper published in Journal of Documentation is over 1 , 000 USD . The average amount increased from 1 , 082 USD in 2008 to 1 , 482 in 2016 . 6 . Library Hi Tech , LIBRI : Although both journals are indexed by WoS , they are respectively ranked as Q3 and Q4 journals in JCR because of their low JIF . These rankings are reflected in the cash awards : the average amount of cash awards to papers published in these two journals is below 800 USD . The average amount to LIBRI paper even decreased from 650 USD in 2008 to 484 USD in 2016 .

The average amount of cash award has increased over the past 10 years , except that the amount awarded to papers published in journals with low JIF has decreased . Publications in Nature and Science are awarded the largest amount of cash reward . This trend is also reflected by the change of 5 cash reward policies from Zhejiang University as shown in Table 6 . The amount of cash awarded for publications in prestigious journals ( i . e . Nature , Science , PNAS ) increased while the amount for publications in other journals declined . Only the first author could receive cash rewards , except that non - first authors could get a discounted amount when publishing in Nature or Science .

Such preferences also differ in universities from different regions . About 90 % of universities in developed regions preferred either the original JIF - based reward policies or the JCR Quartile - based reward policies , while 60 % of the one - price reward policies were favoured by universities in developing regions . It was unexpected that Tier 3 universities would like to pay more for publications than Tier 1 and Tier 2 universities , despite having smaller budgets . As Table 7 shows , in 2016 , Tier 3 universities paid double or even triple what Tier 1 and 2 universities did for a paper published in some journals . The average amounts of cash reward at Tier 2 universities for papers published in these journals are between the amounts paid by Tier 3 and Tier 1 universities , respectively . However , we did not find any significant difference in the average amount of cash reward among universities from different regions .

Discussion Traditionally , the monetary reward incentive is used in business to reward employees with money for excellent job performance ( Aguinis , Joo , & Gottfredson , 2013 ) . Chinese universities apply this to awarding their scholars for research performance , thus promoting publication productivity . Considering the low annual salaries of Chinese scholars - - the average annual salary of university professors is around 8 , 600 USD , while the average basic salary of new hired professors is only about 3 , 100 USD ( Altbach , 2012 ) 9 - - the amount of cash - per - publication reward is a huge incentive : the reward value for a JASIST paper is equal to a single year’s salary for a newly hired professor while the cash award for a Nature or Science article is up to 20 times a university professors’ average annual salary . The cash reward policy has been successful as China’s international scientific publication has experienced a period of exponential increase in the past 20 years . On the other hand , the monetary reward incentive also brings some negative effects . Chinese scholars may regard the monetary reward as an extrinsic rather than an intrinsic motivator ( Aguinis et al . , 2013 ; Kohn , 1993 ) . In other words , they are driven to publish just for the monetary reward rather than disseminating knowledge and receiving the recognition defined by the reward system of science ( Robert King Merton , 1973 ) . For example , Professor Gao from Heilongjiang University published 279 papers in a single journal , Acta Crystallographica Section E , and received more than half of the total cash rewards given by Heilongjiang University between 2004 and 2009 ( Lei & Lai , 2010 ) . In this case , the monetary reward incentive creates a negative goal displacement effect ( Frey et al . , 2013 ; Osterloh & Frey , 2014 ) . Prof . Gao’s only research focus in these five years was to find new crystal structures in his lab and always report the results of this to the same journal , because he could accomplish the goal of winning the cash bonus in a short term as contrasted with receiving fewer awards by conducting long - term research projects ( Lei & Lai , 2010 ) . In addition , academic fraud in China , such as plagiarism , academic dishonesty , ghostwritten papers , fake peer review scandal , and so on also appeared in a growing number of publications ( Hvistendahl , 2013 ) . After searching the WoS , we found that the number of paper corrections authored by Chinese scholars increased from 2 in 1996 to 1 , 234 in 2016 , a historic high . This study also indicates the abusive use of bibliometric indicators in these cash reward policies . Although the Journal Impact Factor ( JIF ) is widely recognized to be a poor metric for evaluating the quality of individual papers ( Archambault & Larivière , 2009 ; Lozano , Larivière , & Gingras , 2012 ; Seglen , 1997 ) , it is used in almost all cash reward policies as the golden rule 10 to assess the value of individual research . In addition , this study reveals that the WoS is the only data 9 In his book , Altbach used the purchasing power parity index instead of the pure salary based on the exchange rate for the comparison of professors’ salary among 28 countries . It means that the annual salaries of Chinese scholars here ( 8 , 600 USD and 3 , 100 USD ) represent the amount having the same purchase power as 8 , 600 USD and 3 , 100 USD in US respectively . 10 Although the JCR Quartile is frequently used in the cash reward policies , the ranking of JCR Quartile is also on the basis of JIF . source accepted in these cash reward policies except that some universities offer small cash awards to papers indexed by Engineering Index ( EI ) . Although Scopus could be an alternative to WoS in bibliometric studies ( Norris & Oppenheim , 2007 ; Torres - Salinas , Lopez - Cózar , & Jiménez - Contreras , 2009 ) and indexes more Chinese journals ( Mongeon & Paul - Hus , 2016 ) , it is not recognized by Chinese universities . It also means that publications not indexed by WoS , including millions of papers published in Chinese journals , are almost ignored and excluded from the cash reward . We also found a positive trend among these cash reward policies . The focus of the cash reward policy changed from the quantity to the quality of the international publications when Chinese universities ( especially Tier 1 , 2 universities ) had published an adequate number of WoS papers . This was why many one - price reward policies have been replaced by JCR Quartile - based or citation - based policies since 2008 . In order to promote impact instead of quantity , these universities increased the amount of cash reward for papers published in Q1 and Q2 journals and decreased or stopped payment for papers published in Q3 and Q4 journals . A few universities even abandoned using the JIF and instead used the citation counts as the criterion for evaluating the quality of individual papers in citation - based reward policies . The hierarchical difference among universities was indicated in this trend change . When Tier 1 and Tier 2 universities reduced or cancelled the cash reward for papers published in journals with low JIF ( e . g . Q3 and Q4 journals ) , some Tier 3 universities increased the amount for the same category papers . Indeed , Tier 3 universities have higher demand than Tier 1 and Tier 2 universities for both the quantity and the quality of international publications , so Tier 3 universities pay more cash for each individual paper . Conclusion In this study , after investigating 168 cash - per - publication reward policies from 100 Chinese universities , we described the landscape of the cash - per - publication reward policy in China and revealed its trends since the late 1990s . Chinese universities apply the monetary reward incentive used in business to promote scientific publication productivity , which lead to a radical increase in China’s international scholarly publication . The cash - per - publication reward policy also produces the “Matthew Effect” ( R . K . Merton , 1968 ) among university professors , as the amount of cash reward for publications is much higher than professors’ annual salaries . Publications bring scholars not only cash rewards but also the possibility of future funding and promotion , which reveals the golden rule of academia in China : Publish or Impoverish . This study revealed that monetary reward policies had been widely used to promote research productivity ; these monetary reward policies might bring some negative effects when improving the research productivity , which was not systematically investigated by previous studies . We still know little about the potential impact of these monetary reward policies on research activities , which should be explored in the future . The landscape presented in this study could form a foundation for future studies that investigates the consequence and determinants of monetary reward policies . Some limitations exist in this study . Due to limited data availability , we used convenience sampling , which may influence the sample representation as compared with sampling randomly , and the sampling fraction in Tier 3 universities is much lower than that of Tier 1 and Tier 2 universities . Social science and humanities is also not included in this study . We hope that future research could collect more data and overcome such limitations . Although this study presents a landscape of the cash - per - publication reward policies in China , we did not investigate if a correlation between the cash reward policy and the number of publications exists , which could be explored by future research .
