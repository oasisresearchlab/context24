Infection with Mu leads to destruction of both cutaneous and subcu - taneous tissues . The pathology of BU is strongly associated with the production of mycolactone , because injection of purifi ed toxin into the skin of guinea pigs is suffi cient to provoke ulcers , and strains of Mu defi cient for its biosynthesis do not cause disease ( 2 ) . The human immune response to Mu follows a complex scheme consisting of three phases . Lesions typically start as a single , painless , acid - fast positive subcutaneous nodule , edema , or plaque , enlarging over time . Histopathological analysis of human and animal skin biopsies ( 3 ‚Äì 5 ) , as well as quantitative measurement of cytokine mRNAs in human tissues ( 6 , 7 ) , have shown that nod - ules are the site of potent Th1 cell ‚Äì oriented anti - mycobacterial infl ammatory responses . As the disease progresses , ulcers eventually form and are characterized by extensive necrosis of subcuta - neous tissues and dermal collagen ( 4 ) . Surprisingly , in the face of considerable cellular necrosis , there is minimal infl ammation . Moreover , sup - pression of Th 1 responses , as indicated by de - fective systemic production of IFN - Œ≥ , has been repeatedly reported in BU patients with active ulcers ( 7 ‚Äì 12 ) . Importantly , the defect in the IFN - Œ≥ response by T cells is not antigen specifi c and resolves during healing or after surgical excision of the lesions ( 11 , 12 ) , thus indicating Selective suppression of dendritic cell functions by Mycobacterium ulcerans toxin mycolactone Emmanuelle Coutanceau , 1 Jeremie Decalf , 3 Angelo Martino , 2 Aur√©lie Babon , 2 Nathalie Winter , 2 Stewart T .

Surprisingly , infected tissues lack infl ammatory infi ltrates . Structural similarities between mycolactone and immunosuppressive agents led us to investigate the immunomodulatory properties of mycolactone on dendritic cells ( DCs ) , the key initiators and regulators of immune responses . At noncytotoxic concentrations , phenotypic and functional maturation of both mouse and human DCs was inhibited by mycolactone . Notably , mycolactone blocked the emigration of mouse - skin DCs to draining lymph nodes , as well as their maturation in vivo . In human peripheral blood ‚Äì derived DCs , mycolactone inhibited the ability to activate allogeneic T cell priming and to produce infl ammatory molecules . Interestingly , production of the cytokines interleukin ( IL ) 12 , tumor necrosis factor ùõÇ , and IL - 6 was only marginally affected , whereas production of the chemo - kines macrophage infl ammatory protein ( MIP ) 1 ùõÇ , MIP - 1 ùõÉ , regulated on activation , normal T cell expressed and secreted , interferon ùõÑ ‚Äì inducible protein 10 , and monocyte chemo - attractant protein 1 was abolished at nanomolar concentrations . Importantly , mycolactone endogenously expressed by Mu mediated similar inhibitory effects on ùõÉ - chemokine produc - tion by DCs . In accordance with the histopathological features of BUs , our results suggest that bacterial production of mycolactone may limit both the initiation of primary immune responses and the recruitment of infl ammatory cells to the infection site . Moreover , they highlight a potential interest in mycolactone as a novel immunosuppressive agent .

Intriguingly , the structure of mycolactone reveals a mac - rocyclic polyketide , typical of a large class of natural products produced by actinomycetes . The structure of mycolactone shares similar features with the macrocyclic triene rapamycin from Streptomyces , the macrolide lactone FK506 , and the soil fungi metabolite cyclosporine A , all potent immunosuppres - sive drugs altering the functional immunobiology of lym - phocytes and DCs ( Fig . S1 , available at http : / / www . jem . org / cgi / content / full / jem . 20070234 / DC1 ) . DCs are key players in the initiation of cellular responses and the regulatory processes leading to impaired cellular immunity . On the basis of the structural resemblances of mycolactone with these immunosuppressors , and from the observation that BU patients with active ulcers display cellular anergy , we postulated that mycolactone may exert immunomodulatory properties on DCs . The present study utilizes both mouse and human primary DCs and demonstrates that mycolactone is indeed a potent suppressor of the capacity of DCs to prime cellular immune responses and produce the chemotactic signals critical for the initiation of an infl ammatory response . Our results provide novel information into the pathogenesis of Mu infection and further characterize a potentially useful immunosuppres - sive agent . RESULTS Effect of mycolactone on DC viability Given the data that mycolactone induces cell death in several cell types , it was initially important to assess the impact of the toxin on DC viability . The induction of apoptosis in immature and mature DC ( iDC and mDC , respectively ) preparations after exposure to mycolactone for 24 ‚Äì 48 h was determined by phosphatidylserine exposure ( Annexin V staining ) and loss of membrane integrity ( propidium iodide [ PI ] staining ) . In both mouse and human DCs , we observed a dose - dependent in - crease in the percentage of apoptotic iDCs ( Fig . 1 , A and C ) . Induction of apoptosis nevertheless remained marginal with mycolactone doses < 50 ng / ml . Interestingly , iDCs of both mouse and human origin were more sensitive to mycolactone - induced apoptosis than mDCs ( Fig . 1 , B and D ) . This was the case when LPS or TNF was used as a maturation stimulus . Of note , only low levels of necrotic cells were observed in the cell cultures ( unpublished data ) . Mycolactone inhibits DC maturation We next examined whether the maturation of DCs is infl u - enced by exposure to mycolactone . Only mycolactone doses < 50 ng / ml were considered , and PI + cells were excluded Figure 1 . DCs survive exposure to mycolactone doses < 50 ng / ml .

The analysis was performed on CD11c + - gated cells incubated with mycolactone for 24 or 48 h concomitantly with 10 ng / ml LPS ( iDCs ) or after 24 h of stimulation with 10 ng / ml LPS ( mDCs ) .

JEM VOL . 204 , June 11 , 2007 1397 ARTICLE from the fl ow cytometric analysis . A strong inhibitory eff ect was seen in human iDCs matured by TNF - Œ± / prostaglandin E 2 ( PGE 2 ) , as demonstrated by the failure to up - regulate CD83 and CD25 ( Fig . 2 A ) . Although the mean fl uorescence intensity ( MFI ) for CD83 and CD25 expression varied among donors , we observed a reproducible inhibition of maturation when iDCs were exposed to mycolactone ( Fig . 2 B ) . To bet - ter quantify the inhibitory eff ect of mycolactone , the per - centage of inhibition was calculated for several DC maturation markers ( CD83 , CD25 , CD80 , and CD40 ; Table I ) . Data from iDCs exposed to maturation stimuli for 24 and 48 h are shown . CD83 was the most aff ected marker , with a signifi - cant reduction in surface expression 24 h after treatment in the presence of 20 ng / ml mycolactone . CD25 expression was also markedly altered , whereas the expression of CD80 and CD40 was only marginally modifi ed . Similarly , in mouse iDCs stimulated with LPS in the presence of mycolactone , we observed a dose - dependent inhibition of CD86 and MHC class II surface expression ( unpublished data ) . To determine if this eff ect was reversible , we washed out the mycolactone after 24 h and returned them to culture wells containing maturation stimuli . In both the mouse and hu - man culture systems , inhibition of maturation persisted af - ter mycolactone was removed from the culture medium ( unpublished data ) . Mycolactone inhibits functional maturation and migration programs in DCs To evaluate mycolactone eff ects on DC migration , we used an in vivo migration model in which TNF - Œ± is injected in - tradermally into the ear , which triggers a massive traffi cking of DCs into the auricular draining lymph node ( ADLN ) ( 13 ) . DC migration was quantifi ed by sacrifi cing the mice after 4 h and assessing the number and maturation state of DCs emi - grating from the skin . When mycolactone was coadminis - tered with TNF - Œ± , we observed a striking reduction in the proportion of migratory DCs ( Fig . 3 A ) . In addition , we ob - served a reduced CD86 and MHC class II surface expression on DCs that crawled out of the skin , as well as on DCs that reached ADLNs in the conditions under which mice had been injected with mycolactone ( Fig . 3 B and not depicted ) . These data indicated that mycolactone impairs the capac - ity of DCs to undergo maturation and up - regulate the ma - chinery required for eff ective migration to the draining lymph node . We also observed an inhibition of functional maturation in human DCs . This was shown by assaying for the priming of allogeneic T cells in a mixed lymphocyte reaction . Strikingly , exposure of DCs to 10 ng / ml mycolactone during matura - tion resulted in > 70 % inhibition of their allostimulatory ca - pacity ( Fig . 4 ) . Collectively , the data in Figs . 2 ‚Äì 4 demonstrate that exposure of DC to noncytotoxic doses of mycolactone results in the inhibition of both phenotypic and functional maturation of DCs . Figure 3 . Mycolactone inhibits functional maturation of DCs in vivo . ( A ) Mice were injected intradermally into the ear with TNF - Œ± alone ( ‚àí ) or TNF - Œ± + mycolactone ( + ) . After 4 h , mice were killed . Ear explants were placed in an overnight culture , and the number of DCs in the crawl - out population was determined . Data are means and SD of CD11c + PI ‚àí cell numbers from pooled skin explant cultures of two independent experiments .

The proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes after incubation with allogeneic mycolactone - treated DCs is shown . DCs were matured in vitro with TNF - Œ± / PGE 2 in the presence of 0 , 10 , or 25 ng / ml mycolactone for 48 h and extensively washed before addition to the lymphocytes . T cell proliferation was measured after 6 d of co - culture .

Mycolactone - treated DCs fail to produce chemoattractant molecules In addition to the IFN - Œ≥ response defect in Mu - infected patients , the ulcers are characterized by an abnormally low amount of infl ammation . We therefore evaluated the eff ect of mycolactone on iDC biology , as tissue DCs play an im - portant role in the initiation of an infl ammatory response and the attraction of innate eff ector cells to the site of infection . We performed a broad screen of infl ammatory cytokines and chemokines produced by DCs after exposure to Toll - like receptor ( TLR ) ligands . As shown in Fig . 5 ( A and B ) , mycolactone treatment only moderately aff ected the capac - ity of mouse or human DCs to produce IL - 12 upon stimu - lation with LPS or poly I : C , TLR - 4 , and TLR - 3 ligands , respectively . Similarly , little eff ect was seen on TNF - Œ± and IL - 6 production in LPS - or poly I : C ‚Äì stimulated human DCs ( Fig . 5 , D and E ) . In mouse DCs stimulated with LPS , mRNA expression for IL - 6 was not substantially modifi ed ( Fig . 5 C ) . Inhibition of IL - 1 Œ± and IL - 1 Œ≤ mRNA expression was observed in LPS - stimulated mouse iDCs , but no comparable suppression of IL - 1 Œ≤ production could be detected in LPS - or poly I : C ‚Äì stimulated human DCs ( unpublished data ) . Therefore , exposure of iDCs to mycolactone during stimula - tion does not critically modify their expression of infl amma - tory cytokines . In contrast , the production of macrophage infl ammatory protein ( MIP ) 1 Œ± , MIP - 1 Œ≤ , regulated on activation , normal T cell expressed and secreted ( RANTES ) , IFN - Œ≥ ‚Äì inducible protein ( IP ) 10 , and monocyte chemoattractant protein ( MCP ) 1 was markedly reduced by a 24 - h exposure of human iDCs to 25 ng / ml mycolactone ( Fig . 6 ) . This was evident in both LPS - and poly I : C ‚Äì treated iDCs . However , this inhibitory eff ect was not observed with the neutrophil chemoattractant IL - 8 , the expression level of which was not modifi ed by mycolactone treatment in LPS - or poly I : C ‚Äì stimulated human iDCs ( Fig . 6 ) . To evaluate whether myco - lactone endogenously expressed by Mu could mediate similar eff ects , we infected iDCs with WT Mu and compared it with a mycolactone - defi cient mutant ( mup045 ) . Interestingly , all of the proinfl ammatory eff ects of adding the WT Mu were Figure 5 . Mycolactone - treated DCs only moderately alter the expression of infl ammatory cytokines by iDCs .

Data are means and SD and are representative of two independent experiments . JEM VOL . 204 , June 11 , 2007 1399 ARTICLE masked by the presence of endogenous mycolactone , whereas mup045 was capable of inducing a moderate cytokine and chemokine response ( unpublished data ) . In addition , we added LPS to the Mu - infected DC cultures and found that endogenous mycolactone was indeed capable of inhibiting the production of the Œ≤ - chemokines MIP - 1 Œ± , MIP - 1 Œ≤ , and RANTES , as well as MCP - 1 and IP - 10 ( Fig . 7 and not depicted ) . As a control , we added back exogenous mycolac - tone to the mup045 - infected DC cultures . Based on these studies , we conclude that the immunosuppressive eff ects of mycolactone account for the abnormal infl ammatory response in BUs . D I S C U S S I O N Until recently , it was assumed that Mu was the only Myco - bacterium species producing mycolactone . In fact , other mycolactone - producing mycobacteria have been isolated from fi sh and frogs presenting ulcerative diseases ( 14 ‚Äì 17 ) . All these species contain versions of the Mu virulence plasmid , pro - duce mycolactones , and show genetic relatedness to Mu and M . marinum , a Mycobacterium species causing localized skin granulomas in humans and an acute lethal pathology in fi sh ( 18 ) . On the basis of a genetic analysis , Yip et al . ( 18 ) sug - gested that mycolactone - producing mycobacteria may have evolved from a common M . marinum progenitor to form two Figure 6 . Mycolactone considerably affects the expression of infl ammatory chemokines by iDCs . The expression of MIP - 1 Œ± , MIP - 1 Œ≤ , RANTES , IP - 10 , MCP - 1 , and IL - 8 chemokines is shown for human monocyte - derived iDCs , or TNF - Œ± / PGE 2 ‚Äì matured mDCs , after stimulation with LPS or poly I : C in the presence of increasing doses of mycolactone for 24 h . Data are means and SD and are representative of two indepen - dent experiments . Table I .

The expression of mycolactone - like com - pounds nevertheless remains restricted to these particular species , and no such complex polyketides have thus far been isolated from other pathogenic mycobacteria . Polyketides are a diverse class of secondary metabolites produced by polyketide synthases ( PKSs ) . Mycobacteria ex - press a remarkable arrays of PKSs , which generate multiple cell wall ‚Äì associated lipids ( 19 ) . At the interface with the host immune system , some of these envelope components have been shown to be important virulence factors and immune modulators . For example , in M . tuberculosis , glycosylation of the PKS products phenol phtiodiolones leads to the genera - tion of phenolic glycolipids , which are potent inhibitors of proinfl ammatory cytokine release by monocyte - derived mac - rophages ( 20 ) . With respect to mycolactone , the genetic basis of its biosynthesis has been recently elucidated with the isola - tion of a 174 - kb plasmid encoding three modular PKSs ( 21 ) . Interestingly , mycolactone PKSs present highly unusual features in terms of size and structure , and mycolactone is the fi rst example of a complex polyketide isolated from pathogenic mycobacteria . In fact , the macrocyclic polyketide structure of mycolactone shares similarities with that of complex polyketides typically produced by fi lamentous soil actinomycetes such as Streptomyces . Strikingly , analysis of the chromosomal sequence reveals that numerous PKS genes are inactivated in Mu , sug - gesting that energy and PKS - specifi c substrates are preferen - tially allocated to mycolactone biosynthesis in this species ( 22 ) . In the present study , we demonstrate that this original polyketide has the unique capacity to modulate DC functions in a selective manner . The ulcerative properties of Mu have been attributed to the cytopathic action of mycolactone , which is able to cause growth arrest in cultured fi broblasts , as well as cell death via apoptosis in fi broblast and macrophage cell models after 3 ‚Äì 5 d of exposure ( 23 ) . Cell susceptibility to mycolactone activity nevertheless varies with the cell type . For example , Mu lipid extracts showed no cytostatic activity on Jurkat T cells , whereas they markedly suppressed the cell - cycle progression and viability of a mouse pre ‚Äì B cell line ( 24 ) . In the present study , we found that the susceptibility of DCs to mycolac - tone cytotoxicity was higher during the immature state . Col - lectively , these observations suggest that the molecular target of mycolactone is ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells but may be diff erentially expressed , depending on the cell type or the cell activation state . Although the mechanism by which mycolactone acts as a cytotoxic agent is intriguing , we have focused on the immuno - suppressive eff ects of nontoxic doses . We found that myco - lactone strongly aff ects the maturation of both mouse and human DCs . In particular , we show a failure to up - regulate the phenotypic markers of the mature DCs CD83 and CD25 , and to a lower extent CD80 and CD40 . This maturation defect was not reversed by removal of mycolactone from cell - culture medium , suggesting that mycolactone durably aff ects DC maturation . In addition , we demonstrate that mycolac - tone - treated DCs show a reduced allostimulatory capacity and that they are inhibited in their ability to cross - present an - tigens to T cells ( Fig . S2 , available at http : / / www . jem . org / cgi / content / full / jem . 20070234 / DC1 ) . That said , other fea - tures of maturing DCs remained intact . In particular , phago - cytic activity of DCs , as measured by the quantity of intracellular fl uorescent beads after 4 h , was not reduced by coincubation of the cells with 10 ‚Äì 100 ng / ml mycolactone ( unpublished data ) . The fact that mycolactone limits the migratory properties of DCs , as well as their ability to mature and activate antigen - specifi c T cells in vivo ( Fig . S3 ) , thus further suggests that mycolactone suppresses the capacity of DCs to prime cellular immune responses . These fi ndings may help explain the global defect in IFN - Œ≥ production by T cells in BU patients and the fact that once BU lesions are excised , there is a resto - ration of Th1 cellular responses ( 12 ) . We also explored the eff ect of mycolactone on the ability of DCs to secrete proinfl ammatory molecules . Surprisingly , we observed a selective eff ect on inducible chemokines . In particular , mycolactone blocked the production of the monocyte and lymphocyte chemoattractants MIP - 1 Œ± , MIP - 1 Œ≤ , IP - 10 , RANTES , and MCP - 1 . MIP - 1 Œ± , MIP - 1 Œ≤ , and Figure 7 . Endogenous production of mycolactone blocks the expression of infl ammatory chemokines by Mu - infected iDCs . The expression of MIP - 1 Œ± , MIP - 1 Œ≤ , and RANTES is shown for human monocyte - derived iDCs after infection with WT Mu or a mycolactone - defi cient mutant ( mup045 ) , using an multiplicity of infection of 1 : 1 or 5 : 1 acid - fast bacilli / cell , in the presence of 10 Œº g / ml LPS . Controls include medium only , iDCs stimulated with LPS in the presence of 25 ng / ml mycolactone , and iDCs infected with mup045 in the presence of 25 ng / ml mycolactone . Data are means and SD and are representative of four independent experiments . JEM VOL . 204 , June 11 , 2007 1401 ARTICLE RANTES are ligands for CC chemokine receptor 5 , which is specifi cally expressed by iDCs and Th1 T cells ( 25 , 26 ) . Defective production of these infl ammatory chemokines is therefore likely to interfere with both the innate and adap - tive immune responses to Mu infection . Specifi cally , decreased Œ≤ - chemokine production by mycolactone - exposed DCs may limit the recruitment and activation of iDC precursors to the infl ammation site . In addition , defective production of these CC chemokine receptor 5 ligands , as well as the CXC che - mokine receptor 3 ligand IP - 10 , is likely to interfere with the homing capacity of IFN - Œ≥ ‚Äì secreting T cells to infected tissues . This hypothesis is strongly supported by the observation that , in contrast to DCs infected with mup045 , DCs infected with the WT strain failed to produce the chemokines MIP - 1 Œ± , MIP - 1 Œ≤ , and RANTES . In accordance with the histopatho - logical features of BUs , bacterial production of myco lactone may therefore be responsible for suppressing the innate immune responses of iDCs , thus preventing the traffi cking of infl am - matory cells to the ulcerative lesion . The exogenous addition of mycolactone to mup045 - infected DCs resulted in a strong reduction of their Œ≤ - chemokine response to infection , further demonstrating the critical im - portance of the toxin in this process . Interestingly , the inhibi - tion of Œ≤ - chemokine production by exogenous mycolactone in mup045 - infected DCs was incomplete , particularly in the case of MIP - 1 Œ≤ , suggesting that mycolactone may regulate the expression of other immunosuppressive agents . Suppression of these infl ammatory chemokines was nearly complete with minimal doses of mycolactone , whereas the expression of the infl ammatory cytokines TNF - Œ± , IL - 12 , and IL - 6 was only marginally modifi ed . Accordingly , IL - 12 , IL - 1 Œ≤ , and TNF - Œ± mRNA were detected at considerable levels in lesions from BU patients and were not substantially modu - lated between the nodular and ulcerative stages of the disease ( 6 ) , suggesting that mycolactone has little impact on the level of expression of these cytokines in vivo . Th 1 cellular responses , as measured by IFN - Œ≥ production , are vigorous during the nodular stage of BU and become defective at later stages of the disease . From our results , we can propose that , in contrast to infl ammatory cytokines , defective infl ammatory chemo - kines may constitute a hallmark of early Mu infection , as well as a sensitive indicator of BU progression from the nodular to the ulcerative stage . Given the structural similarity between mycolactone and the immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and rapamycin ( Fig . S1 ) , it is interesting to examine their respective activities . FK506 and rapamycin are structural analogues binding the same intracellular receptor , FKBP12 , even though the resulting complex targets a different molecule . Although FK506 and rapamycin are used clinically to suppress activated T cells , recent data suggest that they also aff ect DC diff erentiation and function ( 27 , 28 ) . Interestingly , FK506 has been shown to modulate the production of Œ≤ - chemokines ( 29 , 30 ) . How - ever , FK506 blocks the production of infl ammatory cytokines such as IL - 12 and TNF - Œ± ( 27 ) , as well as IL - 8 ( 31 , 32 ) , all molecules that are not altered in mycolactone - treated DCs . Our results therefore suggest that mycolactone binds a dif - ferent molecular target than FK506 or rapamycin . Further work will be required to map the precise mechanism under - lying mycolactone immunosuppressive activity . In con - clusion , we demonstrate in this study that mycolactone inter feres with DC biology in a unique manner , which helps account for the pathologic features of BU . Moreover , we show that mycolactone inhibits DC maturation with a se - lective eff ect on the chemotactic signals critical for the initi - ation of an infl ammatory response . This specifi city of action defi nes a novel class of potentially useful immunosuppres - sive agents . MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains . Mu 1615 ( Trudeau Mycobacterial Culture Collection strain ; American Type Culture Collection ) was originally isolated in Malaysia from human skin biopsies . The mup045 mutant ( MU1615 : : Tn118 ) possesses a transposon insertion inside the mup045 gene , which results in its inability to produce mycolactone ( 3 , 21 ) . The Mu 1615 and mup045 mutant strains were provided by P . L . Small ( University of Tennessee , Knoxville , TN ) . The bac - teria were grown on agar plates ( 7H9 ; DIFCO ) supplemented with 10 % oleic acid ‚Äì albumin ‚Äì dextrose ( Becton Dickinson ) at 31 ¬∞ C . For infection studies , bacteria from exponentially growing cultures were harvested and resuspended in a DC culture medium before homogenization by fi ltration through a sy - ringe needle and enumeration by the Ziehl - Neelsen procedure . Bacteria were added to DC cultures at a multiplicity of infection of 1 : 1 or 5 : 1 , and plates were centrifuged for 2 min at 700 rpm before incubation at 37 ¬∞ C . Animals . 6 - wk - old C57BL / 6JIco and OT2 female mice were purchased from Charles Rivers Laboratories . Animals were maintained under specifi c pathogen - free conditions and used at 8 ‚Äì 12 wk of age . All animal work was approved by institutional animal experimentation committees . Mycolactone preparation . Mycolactone purifi cation was performed as previously described ( 2 ) . The purity of the preparation was controlled by mass spectrometry analysis , as previously described ( 33 ) . Generation of DCs from mouse bone marrow . Bone marrow ‚Äì derived DCs were essentially generated by the procedure described by Inaba et al . ( 34 ) . In brief , total bone marrow was recovered from the femurs of C57 / BL6 mice , and cell suspensions were stained with a cocktail of M5 / 114 ( anti ‚Äì MHC class II ) , RA3 - 6B2 ( anti - B220 ) , HO2 . 2 ( anti - CD8 ) , GK1 . 5 ( anti - CD4 ) , and RB6 - 8C5 ( anti ‚Äì Ly - 6G ) antibodies , followed by magnetic bead negative selection . The remaining cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % FCS , 50 Œº M 2 - ME , 2 . 5 ng / ml recombinant mouse GM - CSF and 10 ng / ml recombinant mouse IL - 4 . Generation of DCs from human peripheral blood . PBMCs were isolated from whole blood by sedimentation over a Ficoll - Hypaque gradient ( GE Healthcare ) . T cell ‚Äì enriched and T cell ‚Äì depleted fractions were pre - pared by adherence to plastic in 1 % single donor plasma . iDCs were pre - pared from the T cell ‚Äì depleted fraction by culturing cells in the presence of 1 , 000 U / ml GM - CSF ( Berlex ) and 500 ‚Äì 1 , 000 U / ml IL - 4 ( R & D Systems ) for 6 d . Cultured cells consisted of > 75 % CD14 ‚Äì CD83 ‚Äì HLA - DR + DCs , with contaminating cells being B cells and dying myeloid cells . To generate mDCs , cultures were stimulated on day 6 with 50 ng / ml TNF - Œ± ( Qbiogene ) and 10 mM PGE 2 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 36 ‚Äì 48 h , as previously described ( 23 ) . At that time , cells were > 85 % CD14 ‚Äì CD83 + HLA - DR hi DCs . DC cytokine production analysis . The production of IL - 12 by mouse DCs was measured in culture supernatants after a 48 - h stimulation with 10 Œº g / ml LPS ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in the presence of mycolactone , using an ELISA assay based on the detection of p40 subunit ( Biolegend ) . Expression of cytokine 1402 DENDRITIC CELL IMMUNOSUPPRESSION BY MYCOLACTONE | Coutanceau et al . mRNA by mycolactone - exposed mouse DCs was also measured after a 48 - h stimulation with 10 Œº g / ml LPS , using the multiprobe RNase protec - tion assay ( BD Biosciences ) . In brief , a 32 P - labeled mcK - 2b template was prepared . Total mRNA , isolated from DCs using RNAzol ( Cinna / TEL - TEST ) , was then hybridized with the probes and digested with RNase . Pro - tected probes were analyzed by migration on polyacrylamide gel ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) , according to the manufacturer‚Äôs protocols . Templates for the housekeeping genes L32 and GAPDH were used to normalize the total RNA content of the samples . Cytokine and chemokine release by monocyte - derived DCs was mea - sured by Luminex ( 12 - plex kit ; Biosource International ) . 30 , 000 ‚Äì 45 , 000 iDCs ( TNF - Œ± / PGE 2 ‚Äì matured DCs ) were stimulated with 10 Œº g / ml LPS or poly I : C ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in 200 Œº l RPMI 1640 with 1 % human serum for 20 h , in the presence of the doses of mycolactone indicated in the fi gures . Alternatively , 100 , 000 iDCs were infected with Mu ( WT or mup045 ) and incubated for 20 h in the presence of 10 Œº g / ml LPS . 50 Œº l of supernatants or standard were incubated with antibody - linked beads for 2 h , washed twice , and incubated for 1 h with biotinylated secondary antibodies . A fi nal incubation of 30 min with streptavidin - PE was performed before data acqui - sition ( 100 events minimum per bead ) on a 100 IS apparatus ( Luminex ) . Values above or below the standard curves were replaced by the lowest or highest concentrations measured . Allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction . 2 √ó 10 5 purifi ed T cells per well were plated with mDCs exposed to the doses of mycolactone indicated in the fi gures in RPMI 1640 with 5 % pooled human serum ( Labquip ) . Co - cultures were incubated for 4 ‚Äì 5 d at 37 ¬∞ C and pulsed with 1 Œº Ci ( 0 . 037 MBq ) [ 3 H ] thymidine during the last 16 h of culture . [ 3 H ] thymidine incorporation was measured by means of a liquid scintillation counter ( Micro96 ; Skatron ) . Skin explant cultures and preparation of ADLN cell suspensions . C57BL / 6 mice ( n = 5 ) were injected intradermally in the ear with 50 ng TNF - Œ± ( R & D Systems ) , with or without 50 Œº g mycolactone . 4 h later , ani - mals were killed , and ears were surgically removed . Dorsal and ventral halves were split and layered on RPMI 1640 with 10 % FCS , 100 mM Hepes , and 100 Œº g / ml penicillin . After 24 h at 37 ¬∞ C , ear skin explant migrating cells were pooled and fi ltered through a 70 - Œº m nylon mesh before antibody staining . ADLN cells were dissociated from the matrix by a 25 - min incuba - tion at 37 ¬∞ C with 1 mg / ml collagenase D and 40 Œº g / ml DNase I ( Roche Diagnostics ) in RPMI 1640 . Cells were collected and washed in PBS before FACS analysis . Online supplemental material . Fig . S1 shows the structures of mycolac - tone , cyclosporin A , rapamycin , and FK506 . Fig . S2 depicts in vitro cross - presentation studies . Fig . S3 shows that mycolactone inhibits the capacity of DCs to prime lymphocytes in vivo . The percentage of proliferating CFSE + cells was calculated as previously described ( 35 ) .
