Motivation Buildings consume significant energy - More than 70 % of total US energy consumption - More than 40 % of total carbon emissions How can we reduce building energy footprint ? HVAC constitutes major part of building energy consumption . So goal should be to reduce HVAC energy consumption . But how ? Aggressive Duty Cycling of Smart Buildings - Occupancy data is sent to our central database . - Our engine then analyzes the data and duty cycles the HVAC based on the real time occupancy information . " Duty - Cycling Buildings Aggressively : The Next Frontier in HVAC Control " Thomas Weng , Bharathan Balaji , Seemanta Dutta , Rajesh Gupta , Yuvraj Agarwal A Sample deployment and the associated hardware Implementation Diagram of our system The Synergy Occupancy Node Wireless sensor node to determine occupancy - Low power and lifetime exceeding several years . - Focus on low cost ( less than $ 15 ) and form factor for ease of deployment . - Deployed ZigbeeÂ® based sensor network consisting of occupancy nodes in offices across 2 nd floor of CSE Building ( EBU3b ) - Occupancy nodes update database with room - wise occupancy information and our backend engine then duty cycles the HVAC based on the real time occupancy information .
