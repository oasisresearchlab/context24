Adenovirus ( Ad ) enters target cells by re - ceptor - mediated endocytosis , escapes to the cytosol , and then delivers its DNA genome into the nucleus . Here we analyzed the trafficking of fluorophore - tagged viruses in HeLa and TC7 cells by time - lapse micros - copy . Our results show that native or taxol - stabilized microtubules ( MTs ) support alternating minus - and plus end—directed movements of cytosolic virus with el - ementary speeds up to 2 . 6 (cid:109) m / s . No directed movement was observed in nocodazole - treated cells . Switching be - tween plus - and minus end—directed elementary speeds at frequencies up to 1 Hz was observed in the periphery and near the MT organizing center ( MTOC ) after re - covery from nocodazole treatment . MT - dependent mo - tilities allowed virus accumulation near the MTOC at population speeds of 1—10 (cid:109) m / min , depending on the cell type . Overexpression of p50 / dynamitin , which is known to affect dynein - dependent minus end—directed vesicular transport , significantly reduced the extent and the frequency of minus end—directed migration of cyto - solic virus , and increased the frequency , but not the ex - tent of plus end—directed motility . The data imply that a single cytosolic Ad particle engages with two types of MT - dependent motor activities , the minus end— directed cytoplasmic dynein and an unknown plus end— directed activity . Key words : adenovirus ¥ virus entry ¥ microtubules ¥ bidirectional movement ¥ dynein / dynactin V IRUSES which replicate in the cell nucleus must tar - get their genome to the nucleus when entering a new host cell . One of the obstacles these viruses encounter is the diffusional barrier imposed by the cy - toplasm . Within the eukaryotic cytoplasm organelles , solutes , and a complex lattice - like mesh of microtubule ( MT ) , 1 actin , and intermediate filament networks effec - tively restrict free diffusion of molecules larger than 500 kD ( Luby - Phelps , 1994 ; Seksek et al . , 1997 ) . Movement of large complexes , like membranous organelles and also ri - bonucleoprotein particles in developing oocytes is depen - dent on active processes and generally involves either the actin or MT cytoskeleton ( Gr(cid:159)nert and St . Johnston , 1996 ; Hirokawa et al . , 1998 ; Holleran et al . , 1998 ; Mermall et al . , 1998 ) . Similarly , viral structures destined for nuclear deliv - ery can be large complexes up to hundreds of nanometers in diameter , and are thus not expected to move by free dif - fusion through the cytoplasm , but engage with some form of active transport ( Greber , 1998a ; Whittaker and Helenius , 1998 ) . A known form of cell - assisted pathogen movement is the actin polymerization - dependent motility of cytosolic Vaccinia virus and Shigella and Listeria bacteria ( Cud - more et al . , 1997 ; Ireton and Cossart , 1997 ; Welch et al . , 1997 ) . Examples for MT - dependent processes are the movement of endosomal reovirus ( Georgi et al . , 1990 ) and the localization of cytosolic Herpes simplex virus capsids to the cell nucleus ( Sodeik et al . , 1997 ) . Human adenoviruses ( Ads ) are nonenveloped viruses , which replicate and produce progeny virions within the nucleus of an infected cell , i . e . , epithelial cells of the upper and lower respiratory tract , or the gastrointestinal and uri - nary tracts ( for reviews see Horwitz , 1990 ; Shenk , 1996 ) . The virus particle is icosahedral , has a diameter of (cid:122) 90 nm , and is composed of an outer capsid and an inner DNA - associated core with a 36 - kb linear DNA , two terminal proteins , and condensing proteins V and VII ( Burnett , 1997 ) . Ads , such as the common type 2 or 5 viruses ( Ad2 M . Suomalainen and M . Y . Nakano contributed equally to this work . Address correspondence to U . F .

Ads have been detected in as - sociation with cellular MTs ( Dales and Chardonnet , 1973 ; Miles et al . , 1980 ) , passing from nerve termini to cell bod - ies by axonal transport ( Ghadge et al . , 1995 ; Ridoux et al . , 1994 ) and binding to isolated MTs in vitro ( Luftig and Weihing , 1975 ; Weatherbee et al . , 1977 ) . It is , however , not known if MTs are required for directional transport of the virus to the nucleus . The MT network of an interphase cell is a dynamic po - larized structure . Relatively stable minus ends are local - ized to the MT organizing center ( MTOC ) , which is typi - cally located at a perinuclear position in cultured cells ( Mandelkow and Mandelkow , 1995 ) . The dynamic , fast - growing and fast - shrinking plus ends extend towards the cell periphery ( Desai and Mitchison , 1997 ) . Directional movement along MTs is mediated by motor proteins which hydrolyze ATP to induce conformational changes in their structure . Motor proteins are needed for a variety of cellular activities , such as positioning of the mitotic spindle apparatus , movement of mitotic chromosomes , vesicular trafficking and maintenance of cell shape ( Vallee and Sheetz , 1996 ; Hoyt et al . , 1997 ; Hirokawa et al . , 1998 ) . Mo - tors are classified according to the sequences of their mo - tor domains and the directionality of their motion ( Vale and Fletterick , 1997 ; Hirokawa , 1998 ) . Kinesin super - family motors typically move towards the MT plus ends , whereas dynein motors mediate minus end—directed movements . Alternatively to moving along MT tracks , motor proteins can produce directional movement by pro - moting local MT depolymerization and holding onto the ends of the depolymerizing MTs ( Waters and Salmon , 1996 ) . The vast majority of the MT - dependent minus end— directed transport processes in interphase cells require dynein , which is typically associated with dynactin . The mammalian dynein is composed of two heavy chains , which contain motor domains , and four intermediate chains and light intermediate chains ( Vallee and Sheetz , 1996 ) . Dynein is thought to be nonfunctional for minus end—directed cargo transport , unless associated with dy - nactin , a heterooligomeric complex of at least nine differ - ent polypeptides ( Schroer , 1996 ; Holleran et al . , 1998 ) . This concept has been reinforced experimentally by over - expression of the dynactin component p50 / dynamitin , which is thought to dissociate the dynactin complex and severely affects mitosis , and also vesicular trafficking and organelle distribution in interphase cells ( Echeverri et al . , 1996 ; Burkhardt et al . , 1997 ; Ahmad et al . , 1998 ) . Despite much progress on the molecular and cellular anatomy of MT motors and their interactions with mem - branous cargo , much less is known about the MT - depen - dent transport of membrane - free particles . Another unre - solved question concerns the regulation of directionality of cargo movement . To develop an in vivo experimental system for directional motility of a membraneless cargo , we decided to study the dynamics of Ad2 particles in living cells , knowing that the entry process of this virus is di - rected to the cell nucleus with exceptionally high efficien - cies ( Greber et al . , 1993 ) . Our results in HeLa and TC7 cells show that movement of cytosolic Ad2 towards the nucleus depends on intact but not dynamic MTs . Time - lapse fluorescence microscopy indicated that cytosolic wild - type ( wt ) and also endosomal mutant viruses moved with micrometer per second velocities in quasi - straight directions over several micrometers , either towards the MTOC or to the periphery . When the MT network was depolymerized with nocodazole , such long - range transport was abolished and virus distributed randomly in the cyto - plasm . DNA import into the nucleus was effectively in - hibited under these conditions , implying that intact MTs are instrumental for a successful infection . Immediately after restoring MTs , switching between plus - and minus end—directed virus motilities was observed at 0 . 5—1 Hz fre - quencies , either in the cell periphery or near the MTOC , suggesting that single virus particles engaged with both plus - and minus end—directed motors . Overexpression of p50 / dynamitin significantly reduced the extent and the fre - quency of minus end migration of cytosolic Ad , and , sur - prisingly , increased the frequency , but not the extent of plus end—directed motility . In these cells , the population speed was clearly directed to the periphery , unlike in con - trol cells , which transported wt Ad2 towards the MTOC . Dynamitin overexpression , like the depolymerization of MTs with nocodazole , did not affect the ability of wt virus to release a fluid - phase marker from endosomes suggest - ing that virus escape from endosomes neither required MTs nor dynein / dynactin . Together , the data illustrate that cytosolic Ad uses both minus - and plus end—directed MT - dependent motors at micrometer per second veloci - ties , yet , it crosses the cytoplasm at population speeds of micrometers per minute . This study is , together with two recent reports on elec - tron - dense materials underneath the flagellar membrane ( Cole et al . , 1998 ; Pazour et al . , 1998 ) , one of the few ex - amples describing fast bidirectional MT - dependent motili - ties of a nonmembrane bonded particle . Our results extend on the notion that directional MT - dependent transport is not only needed to establish and maintain an asymmetric distribution of cell organelles , but also func - tions to direct incoming virus particles to the site of repli - cation . Materials and Methods Cells , Viruses , Antibodies , and Chemicals HeLa cells ( human cervical epitheloid carcinoma ) were grown as de - scribed earlier ( Greber et al . , 1997 ) . TC7 cells ( African green monkey kid - ney ) and the TC7 clone TC7 / MAP4 / MTB—GFP stably transfected with a cDNA encoding the MT - binding domain of the MT - associated protein 4 ( MAP4 ) linked to enhanced green fluorescent protein ( eGFP ) were kindly provided by J . Bulinski ( Columbia University , New York , NY ) ( Nguyen et al . , 1997 ) . Wt Ad2 and temperature - sensitive ( ts ) 1 mutant Ad2 were grown and isolated as described ( Greber et al . , 1996 ) . Labeling with Texas red ( TR ) was exactly as published ( Greber et al . , 1998 ) .

Microtubule - dependent Adenovirus Motility In Vivo 659 Anti— (cid:98) - tubulin antibody ( N357 ; Amersham ) was used on methanol - fixed cells . Rabbit anti - nuclear lamins A , - B , and - C peptide antibody 8188 was supplied by L . Gerace ( Scripps Research Institute , La Jolla , CA ) and used as described ( Greber et al . , 1997 ) . Mouse monoclonal anti - Polyoma virus middle T tag was obtained from J . C . Perriard ( Eidgen(cid:154)ssische Technische Hochschule , Z(cid:159)rich , Switzerland ) ( Grussenmeyer et al . , 1985 ; Komiyama et al . , 1996 ) . Nocodazole was purchased from Sigma , taxol from Calbio - chem - Novabiochem , and fluorescent dyes from Molecular Probes . Drugs were dissolved as 1 , 000 (cid:51) stocks in DMSO and used as indicated . No drug treatment included appropriately diluted DMSO . Time - lapse Fluorescence Microscopy HeLa cells , TC7 , or TC7 / MAP4 / MTB—GFP cells ( Nguyen et al . , 1997 ) were grown on glass coverslips ( Assistent , Winigor ) in DME - 10 % FBS medium to (cid:122) 20—50 % confluency . Geneticin ( 100 (cid:109) g / ml ; Alexis Biochemi - cals ) was included to maintain the TC7 / MAP4 / MTB—GFP cells . TR - labeled virus ( 1—2 (cid:109) g / ml ) was added in warm RPMI - 0 . 2 % BSA - 20 mM Hepes medium , pH 7 . 4 , for 5 min . Cells were washed several times in RPMI medium . The coverslip was mounted to a homemade temperature - regulated chamber , covered with a glass slide , sealed with silicon grease , and then perfused with warm RPMI medium using a plastic syringe . The system was mounted to an electronically controlled inverted fluorescence microscope ( model DM IRBE B ; Leica ) equipped with a Leica 100 (cid:51) oil immersion objective ( NA 1 . 3 ) , a differential interference contrast ( DIC ) polarizer and fluorescein ( 490 / 7 . 3 nm ) , TR ( 600 / 10 . 1 nm ) , and Cy5 ( 649 / 11 . 4 nm ) excitation filters with bandpass emission filter cubes of 510 / 20 nm ( Dichroic 495 ) , 615 / 30 nm ( Dichroic 595 ) and 690 / 40 nm ( Dichroic 660 ) , respectively ( Omega Optical ) . Fluorescence images were recorded with a digital , back - illuminated charge coupled device camera ( TE / CCD - 1000 , TKB grade 1 ; Princeton Instruments ) onto a 1 , 000 (cid:51) 800 pixel chip ( 15 (cid:51) 15 (cid:109) m / pixel ) at 12 bit / 500 kHz / (cid:50) 40 (cid:56) C using a PCI interface card and the MetaMorph software package ( Universal Imaging ) . Exposure times in the TR channel were between 0 . 2 and 0 . 4 s , yielding less than 1 % saturation of individual pixels . Intervals between subsequent exposures were between 1 . 2 and 2 . 6 s depending on the size of the region of interest selected in a given experiment . Observations typically lasted 1—3 min and were made between 20 and 40 min postinternalization , unless otherwise indicated . At the beginning or end of the experiment , the GFP fluores - cence and / or DIC was recorded to visualize either the MT network ( MAP4 / MTB—GFP ) or GFP alone to identify transfected cells . Individual virus particles showing linear translocations were tracked and velocities ( distance between subsequent frames per time interval ) determined using the MetaMorph tracking module . Velocities (cid:44) 0 . 1 (cid:109) m / s were within the experimental error of our setup . The uncertainty in the tracing analysis was (cid:54) 1 pixel ( 15 (cid:109) m at 100 (cid:51) magnification ) yielding a mean error of 1 . 45 pixels / time interval . Statistical Analysis Elementary speeds ( ES , elementary motion steps per time interval ) were determined for motile TR - labeled particles by recording x , y coordinates as described above . Motile particles were operationally defined as those particles that could be unequivocally traced in at least 20 subsequent frames and translocated in more than five subsequent frames over at least 0 . 5 (cid:109) m in either plus or minus end direction . Depending on the cell type and the length of the observation period , 20—80 % of the particles showed continuous plus - or minus end—directed translocation in five or more subsequent frames over several micrometers . Plus end—directed mo - tility was defined as d i (cid:50) d i (cid:49) 1 (cid:44) 0 and minus end—directed motility as d i (cid:50) d i (cid:49) 1 (cid:46) 0 , ( d i is the particle distance from the presumptive MTOC in frame i , and d i (cid:49) 1 the distance from the MTOC in frame i (cid:49) 1 ) . Calculated ES (cid:44) 0 . 1 (cid:109) m / s were counted as no motility events . An apparent net population velocity was determined by the difference between all minus - and plus end—directed distances divided by the total sampling time . A one - sided t test was applied at the 95 % confidence level to compare the MTOC - and the periphery - directed mean population speeds of wt and ts1 virus in a given cell type under different conditions . Frequencies of MTOC - and pe - riphery - directed speeds and no movements were compared in a chi square test and evaluated at 95 % confidence level . Indirect Immunofluorescence and Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy Cells were grown on 12 - mm glass coverslips in DME - 7 % FBS , transferred to cold RPMI medium containing 0 . 2 % BSA , buffered with Hepes - NaOH to pH 7 . 4 ( binding medium ) and incubated with TR - labeled Ad2 ( 0 . 2—0 . 5 (cid:109) g per 0 . 2 ml ) for 90 min , followed by an incubation in warm DME - BSA at 37 (cid:56) C for indicated times as described ( Greber et al . , 1997 ) . Samples were fixed in pFA , mounted in paraphenylene diamine ( 0 . 5 % ) - glycerol ( 80 % ) - Tris ( 20 mM ) , pH 8 . 8 , and analyzed for single or double epiflu - orescence on a Reichert - Jung Polyvar microscope ( Merck ) equipped with Nomarski DIC , a fluorescein filter set ( 485 / 10 , BP 540 / 20 ) , and a TR filter set ( 557 . 5 / 27 . 5 , LP 615 ) linked to an eight - bit CCD video camera ( model C5405 ; Hamamatsu Photonics ) . Images were collected with the Argus - 20 imaging acquisition software ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) and batch - pro - cessed with Adobe Photoshop ( Adobe Systems ) on an Apple Macintosh computer ( Quadra 650 ) . Triple fluorescence experiments were analyzed on a Leica DM IRBE inverted microscope equipped with a 63 (cid:51) lens and FITC , TR , and Cy5 filter sets as specified above . Confocal microscopy was conducted on a Leica DM IRBE inverted microscope equipped with a 100 (cid:51) lens and a Leica TCS 4D confocal laser scanning device ( Elek - tronenmikroskopisches Zentrallabor of the University of Z(cid:159)rich , also see Greber et al . , 1997 ) . Typical section thickness was estimated to be 300—400 nm based on the pinhole settings . Plasmids and DNA Experiments GFP - encoding plasmid DNA ( gift of S . Zimmermann ; Invitrogen , Z(cid:159)rich , Switzerland ) was transfected into TC7 or HeLa cells alone or together with dynamitin - encoding DNA ( gift of R . Vallee , University of Massachu - setts , Worcester , MA ) ( Echeverri et al . , 1996 ) at a molar ratio of 2 : 1 using Lipofectamine“ ( 5 (cid:109) l / (cid:109) g DNA ; GIBCO BRL ) or TransFast“ ( 7 (cid:109) l / (cid:109) g DNA ; Promega ) . Under these conditions more than 90 % of the trans - fected cells expressed both GFP and dynamitin at 24 h posttransfection . In situ hybridizations to detect incoming viral DNA were carried out as de - scribed ( Greber et al . , 1997 ) , except that the 42 (cid:56) and 60 (cid:56) C wash steps were omitted . A control plasmid encoding hexon loop 1 ( amino acids 160—336 ) was constructed by PCR using the synthetic oligonucleotide AGCT - ACAAGCTTGGATCCCATATGGAAGAGCAAAACGCTCGAGATas an NH 2 - terminal primer and CTCGATGCTGAGCCCCGGGTT - ATTCCATTGGCATGTATTCTCGGGTCTGTTTGGCATAGATTGas a COOH - terminal primer , respectively . The latter also encoded the polyoma middle T tag ( EEYMPME , single amino acid letter code ) in front of the multiple cloning site . PCR products were ligated into the polylinker of pSCT2 (cid:49) using the HindIII and SmaI restriction sites ( Auerbach et al . , 1997 ) and amplified in Escherichia coli . The loop 1 insert of the clone used here was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing . Electron Microscopy and HRP Detection Alcian blue—coated glass coverslips were prepared as follows . Glass cover - slips ( 12 mm ; Assistent ) were washed in a glass beaker with 1 N HCl for 10 min and rinsed with distilled water , 90 % methanol , 50 % methanol , and then again with distilled water . Alcian blue ( 1 % wt / vol Alcian blue - tet - rakis [ methyl - pyridinium ] chloride in water [ Sigma ] ) was added and the liq - uid brought to boiling for 30 s in a microwave oven . Coverslips were rinsed several times in water , placed between filter paper and sterilized by autoclaving and drying . HeLa or TC7 / MAP4 / MTB - GFP cells were seeded onto glass coverslips coated with Alcian blue . Wt Ad2 ( 50 (cid:109) g / ml ) was bound to the cell surface in the cold for 90 min and internalized at 37 (cid:56) C in the presence of HRP ( 20 mg / ml , Type II , 150—200 U / mg ; Sigma ) in DME containing 0 . 2 % BSA for 15 min . HRP was washed out with warm DME containing 0 . 2 % BSA and cells were further incubated at 37 (cid:56) C for 15 min . Samples were quickly washed in PBS several times and fixed in PBS con - taining 2 % glutaraldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , Merck ) for 30 min at room temperature , washed in PBS , and then stained for HRP activ - ity in 0 . 1 M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM MgCl 2 containing 0 . 5 mg / ml diami - nobenzidine ( Sigma ) and 0 . 03 % hydrogen peroxide ( Fluka ) . Samples were then processed for Epon embedding and analyzed by EM as de - scribed ( Greber et al . , 1997 ) .

Physiological Temperature Is Needed for Nuclear Targeting of Ad2 The structural organization of the cytoplasm typically re - stricts the diffusional mobility of artificial particles of 50 nm in diameter to a few square micrometers per second ( Luby - Phelps , 1994 ; Seksek et al . , 1997 ) . Particles larger than 50 nm , such as Ad2 , are expected to have essentially no diffusion mobility under physiological conditions . To test if cytosolic virus was localized to the nucleus in the ab - sence of energy metabolism at a reduced temperature , we bound TR - labeled Ad2 to the surface of HeLa cells in the cold and internalized for 29 min at 37 (cid:56) C . During this time virus is taken up into the cytoplasm but is not yet targeted to the nucleus ( Greber et al . , 1993 , 1997 ) . Cells were sub - sequently shifted to 4 (cid:56) C and incubated in the cold for up to 60 min postinternalization , whereas control cells were kept at 37 (cid:56) C . Since exposure of cells to reduced temperatures causes depolymerization of MTs , targeting was also ana - lyzed in cells that had been pretreated with the MT - stabi - lizing drug taxol . In control cells the large majority of virus particles was directed to the nucleus during the 60 - min in - ternalization , in agreement with previous results ( Fig . 1 ) ( Greber et al . , 1997 ) . In contrast , at reduced temperatures , with or without taxol treatment , virus particles were found randomly distributed in the cytoplasm at 60 min . The same result was obtained if the cold incubation was extended up to 90 min ( data not shown ) . Virus particles also remained cytoplasmic if cellular ATP levels were reduced after 30 min of internalization by shifting cells into a glucose - free medium containing 10 mM sodium azide and 20 mM 2 - deoxy - D - glucose ( data not shown ) . These results con - firmed that incoming Ad2 does not move through the cy - toplasm by diffusion , but uses some form of mediated transport . Microtubule - dependent Minus End—directed Transport of Cytosolic Virus Previous EM studies have detected Ads in close associa - tion with MTs both in vivo and in vitro ( data not shown ) ( Dales and Chardonnet , 1973 ; Luftig and Weihing , 1975 ; Weatherbee et al . , 1977 ; Miles et al . , 1980 ) . To ask whether MTs are actually needed for directional transport of virus to the nucleus , we first tested if virus could be de - tected at the MTOC in cultured epitheloid HeLa cells . In these cells the MTOC predominantly contains the minus ends of MTs and is located in the perinuclear area as con - firmed with an anti— (cid:103) - tubulin immunostaining and confo - cal microscopy ( Fig . 2 A ) . As expected ( i . e . , Moudjou et al . , 1996 ) , (cid:103) - tubulin was found all over the cytoplasm but was concentrated at a perinuclear location ( Fig . 2 A , green dot ) . Of a total of 101 examined cells , 75 % had a perinu - clear enrichment of incoming virus at 60 min postinfection ( p . i . ) . At 15 min postinternalization no enrichment was ob - served . We next analyzed if intact MTs were required for virus targeting to the nucleus . HeLa cells were incubated with 20 (cid:109) M nocodazole for 30 min and virus was bound to the cell surface for 60 min in the cold to synchronize infection and to further depolymerize MTs . Cells were then shifted to 37 (cid:56) C in drug - containing medium for 75 min . Under these conditions , MTs were completely depolymerized as shown with mAb 1A2 and anti— (cid:98) - tubulin immunostain - ings ( data not shown ) . Nocodazole strongly , but not com - pletely inhibited localization of TR - labeled virus to the nuclear envelope as indicated by confocal microscopy ( Fig . 2 B , panel c ) . Similar results were obtained if the internalization time was extended to 135 min ( data not Figure 1 . Ad2 targeting to the nucleus requires phys - iological temperature . TR - labeled Ad2 was cold bound to HeLa cells in the absence ( a—f ) or presence of taxol ( 25 nM ) including a 15 - min prein - cubation with drug in growth medium at 37 (cid:56) C ( g—i ) . Cells were warmed for 29 min ( d—i ) followed by a cold incubation up to 31 min in the absence ( d—f ) or presence ( g—i ) of taxol or were warmed for 60 min in the absence of drug ( a—c ) . Samples were fixed with pFA and analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy . on M a y 9 , 2006 www . j c b . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Suomalainen et al . Microtubule - dependent Adenovirus Motility In Vivo 661 shown ) , thus suggesting that the low level of nuclear tar - geting was most likely due to particles entering from a plasma membrane area near the nucleus . If MTs were re - stored by washing out nocodazole for 75 min , significant virus targeting to the nucleus was observed , similar to cells not treated with the drug ( Fig . 2 B , panels a and e ) . These results were confirmed by analyzing viral DNA import into the nucleus in nocodazole - treated cells using fluores - cence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) and confocal laser scan - ning microscopy at 180 min p . i . Control cells ( no drug ) had a strong signal of viral DNA inside the nucleus as con - cluded from an anti - lamin immunostaining of the nuclear envelope ( Fig . 3 a ) . Noninfected cells had no viral DNA signal , indicating that the FISH conditions were specifi - cally detecting viral genomes ( Fig . 3 c ) ( see also Greber et al . , 1997 ) . In nocodazole - treated cells most of the DNA signal was present in the cytoplasm , sometimes in an ag - gregated form ( Fig . 3 d ) . Note that the combined cytoplas - mic signal was somewhat lower than the nuclear signal in the control ( no drug ) - treated cells , partly because some cytoplasmic virus had been artificially released during the FISH treatments . The absence of viral DNA in the nucleus was not due to a lack of detection or rapid nuclear export , since viral genomes were readily found in the nucleus of cells that were treated with nocodazole beginning at 90 min p . i . , when the majority of virus particles had already arrived at the nuclear envelope ( Fig . 3 f ) . The cytoplasmic DNA signals in the nocodazole - treated cells decreased af - ter washing out the drug and a strong nuclear DNA signal appeared ( Fig . 3 e ) . Taken together , these results sug - gested that intact MTs are needed for targeting of incom - ing virus particles to and for import of viral DNA into the nucleus . It was possible that nocodazole affected endocytosis and / or virus escape from the endosome . We therefore measured the internalization of [ 35 S ] methionine virus into drug - treated cells using a cell surface trypsinization as - say , which measures virus uptake by the emergence of a trypsin - resistant form of the major capsid protein hexon ( Greber et al . , 1993 ) . The results indicate that in the pres - ence of nocodazole half of the virus particles were endocy - tosed at 15 min postwarming , whereas in control cells the half - time of internalization was (cid:122) 9 min ( Fig . 4 A ) . The ef - ficiency of entry at 30 min postwarming was close to 75 % under both conditions . The remaining viruses were most likely shed from the cells into the medium ( Greber et al . , 1993 ) . The data demonstrated that virus uptake into cells lacking intact MTs was slightly slower , but no less efficient than into control cells , in agreement with earlier observa - tions showing that nocodazole had no effect on the forma - tion of endocytic vesicles ( Gruenberg et al . , 1989 ) . We next asked if virus was able to escape from endo - somes in cells lacking MTs . To visualize both endosomes and virus particles at high resolution we used a fluid - phase endosomal marker , HRP , in combination with EM ( Fig . 4 B ) . HeLa cells were pretreated with nocodazole for 15 min . Wt or a mutant virus , ts1 , which is unable to escape from endosomes ( Greber et al . , 1996 ) , were bound to the cells at 4 (cid:56) C . Ts1 has a point mutation P137L in the pro - tease reading frame and , when grown at the nonpermissive temperature , produces particles , which fail to escape from endosomes in a new round of infection ( Weber , 1995 ; Greber , 1998b ) . Virus internalization then occurred in the presence of HRP and drug for 15 min at 37 (cid:56) C , followed by a 15 - min chase without HRP in the presence of nocoda - zole . HRP activity was visualized by incubating the fixed cells with diaminobenzidine , which is converted to an elec - tron dense product by HRP ( Doxsey et al . , 1985 ) . Control cells ( no drug ) contained numerous cytosolic wt particles , also near nuclear pore complexes , but only few viruses were detected within vesicular structures ( Fig . 4 B , panel Figure 2 . Microtubule - dependent transport of Ad2 to the MTOC / nuclear envelope . ( A ) TR - labeled Ad2 was bound to HeLa cells in the cold and internalized for 15 ( panel a ) or 60 min ( panel b ) . Cells were labeled for (cid:103) - tubulin and analyzed by con - focal laser scanning microscopy ( shown are the sections that con - tained the perinuclear punctate (cid:103) - tubulin signal only ) . Virus particles ( red ) and (cid:103) - tubulin ( green ) are pseudocolored . ( B ) TR - labeled Ad2 was bound to HeLa cells in the cold in the absence ( panels a and b ) or presence of either 20 (cid:109) M nocodazole ( panels c—f ) or 25 nM taxol ( panels g and h ) . Drug treatment included a 30 - min preincubation with drugs before virus binding . Cells were warmed to 37 (cid:56) C in the presence or absence of drugs for 75 min ( panels a—d , and h ) or treated with nocodazole for the same time followed by an incubation without drug for 75 min ( panels e and f ) . Cells were fixed in pFA and stained for lamins A , - B , and - C using anti - rabbit FITC and analyzed by confocal microscopy for TR and FITC fluorescence . Complete stacks of optical sections are shown . on M a y 9 , 2006 www . j c b . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 144 , 1999 662 a ) . Interestingly , these cells contained essentially no vesi - cles with HRP reaction product , in contrast to noninfected cells , suggesting that contents of endocytic vesicles were released ( Fig . 4 B , panels a and b ) ( Prchla et al . , 1995 ) . No - codazole - treated cells contained numerous virus particles in the cytosol and only few HRP - positive endosomes , sim - ilar to control cells ( Fig . 4 B , panel b ) . These cytosolic par - ticles were clearly distinguishable entities and often oc - curred in clusters . Ts1 viruses , on the other hand , were exclusively detected within HRP - containing vesicles , as expected ( Fig . 4 B , panel c ) ( Greber et al . , 1996 ) . We con - cluded that MTs were not needed for Ad2 uptake into cells and delivery to the cytosol , but were required for tar - geting of cytosolic virus to the nucleus . Microtubule - dependent Transport of Cytosolic and Endosomal Viruses at Micrometers Per Second A recent report stated that fluorophore - labeled Ad5 parti - cles were able to move in the periphery of human A549 cells over short distances with apparent velocities of 0 . 5— 0 . 6 (cid:109) m / s ( Leopold et al . , 1998 ) . We aimed at analyzing the mechanisms underlying this motility and wanted to test a possible involvement of MTs . We conducted extensive particle tracking analysis in TC7 cells ( an African green monkey kidney cell line ) and in HeLa cells . The TC7 cells have a particularly large and flat cytoplasm and are well suited for studies of cytoplas - mic movement of Ad since they efficiently internalize and target virus to the nucleus ( data not shown ) . To determine the approximate position of the MTOC we used in some experiments a TC7 clone , which was stably transfected with a cDNA encoding a GFP hybrid of the MAP4 MT - binding domain ( MAP4 / MTB—GFP ; Bulinski et al . , 1997 ; Nguyen et al . , 1997 ) . This cell line was viable in our hands for more than 20 passages ( Olson et al . , 1995 ) . TR - labeled Ad2 was internalized at 37 (cid:56) C for 30 min and the coverslip was mounted to a temperature - controlled heating cham - ber placed on an inverted fluorescence microscope . Fluo - rescence images were recorded in the TR channel at 1 . 2— 2 . 6 - s frame intervals over several min as described in Materials and Methods . We use the term ES to define di - rectional movement of particles between two subsequent frames , negative ES indicating movement to the MTOC ( minus end ) and positive ES to the periphery ( plus end ) . At the end of the recordings the MAP4 / MTB—GFP fluores - cence was captured . A representative experiment is shown in Fig . 5 where we traced three different particles . One pe - ripheral particle ( arrow ) was followed throughout the experiment and two MTOC - neighboring particles were traced at the end of the experiment in frames 92—98 ( Fig . 5 B , arrowheads ) . The peripheral particle moved (cid:122) 30 (cid:109) m in a quasi - straight direction towards the MTOC . In Fig . 5 , C and D we plotted the distances of the particle from the MTOC and the ES for each frame . The ES defined two distinct types of activity periods . The first type of activity Figure 3 . Inhibition of Ad2 DNA import in nocodazole - , but not taxol - treated HeLa cells . HeLa cells were pre - treated with either nocoda - zole ( 20 (cid:109) M ) or taxol ( 25 nM ) as described in Fig . 2 . Wt Ad2 ( 20 (cid:109) g / ml ) was bound in the cold in the presence or ab - sence of drugs and internal - ized in DME - BSA medium in the absence ( a ) or presence of taxol ( b ) or nocodazole ( d ) for 180 min . A parallel sam - ple of nocodazole - treated cells was washed several times in drug - free medium and incubated for an addi - tional 180 min in DME - BSA ( e ) . Alternatively , nocoda - zole was added to cells from 90 up to 180 min p . i . ( f ) . All samples including nonin - fected cells ( c ) were then ana - lyzed by in situ hybridization using TR - labeled genomic Ad2 DNA followed by anti - lamin immunolabeling of nu - clear envelopes and confocal laser scanning microscopy . on M a y 9 , 2006 www . j c b . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Suomalainen et al . Microtubule - dependent Adenovirus Motility In Vivo 663 occurred between frames 39—44 and 68—79 and contained exclusively MTOC - directed motions . This activity resulted in efficient particle advancement towards the MTOC and typically lasted for several seconds reaching elementary speeds of 0 . 17—2 . 63 (cid:109) m / s . The other type of activity was characterized by rapidly alternating minus - and plus end— directed ES up to 0 . 5 (cid:109) m / s at nearly equal extents and fre - quencies ( Fig . 5 , frames 1—38 , 45—67 , and 80—104 ) . Such ac - tivities resulted either in a net minus end—directed speed of 2—4 (cid:109) m / min ( frames 44—68 ) , or yielded no net move - ment ( frames 1—38 and 80—104 ) . Note that from frames 80—104 , two additional MTOC - near particles still showed net minus - ( Fig . 5 B , solid arrowhead ) and plus end—directed ( Fig . 5 B , open arrowhead ) movements , indicating that cells and viruses were still motion competent . A population analysis of 958 ES from 15 different parti - cles in TC7 / MAP4 / MTB—GFP cells and 729 ES from 19 different particles in the parental TC7 cells indicated a tailed distribution of both the MTOC - and the periphery - directed speeds , with maximal ES occurrence between 0 . 1 and 0 . 2 (cid:109) m / s ( Fig . 5 , E and F ) ( Table I ) . In MAP4 / MTB— GFP cells , all the MTOC - directed speeds were more prominent than the periphery - directed speeds , in contrast to the parental TC7 cells , in which less minus - and more plus end—directed ES occurred . However , even in these cells , the minus end—directed motion was dominant over the plus end—directed motion as indicated by the mean population speed of (cid:50) 0 . 06 (cid:109) m / s . The MAP4 / MTB—GFP - expressing cells contained significantly more active parti - cles than the parental TC7 or HeLa cells . The number of immobile particles ( ES smaller than 0 . 1 (cid:109) m / s ) amounted to 12 . 8 , 28 . 4 , and 41 . 4 % for TC7 / MAP4 / MTB—GFP , pa - rental TC7 and HeLa cells , respectively ( Tables I and II ) . The mean minus end—directed speed was 0 . 50 (cid:109) m / s in both TC7 cell types , but the mean and also the peak plus end— directed speeds were significantly smaller in the MAP4 / MTB—GFP expressing cells than in the parental cells ( Ta - bles I and II ) . Accordingly , the population mean speed ( comprising all the traced particles ) was significantly shifted to the MTOC direction in the TC7 / MAP4 / MTB— GFP cells ( (cid:50) 0 . 21 (cid:109) m / s ) compared with TC7 cells ( (cid:50) 0 . 06 (cid:109) m / s ) or HeLa cells ( (cid:50) 0 . 03 (cid:109) m / s ) . Although the mean mi - nus - and plus end—directed speeds in HeLa cells were sig - nificantly smaller than in TC7 cells ( perhaps relating to the fact that the TC7 cells allowed longer tracking analysis than the HeLa cells ) , the calculated population average speeds for wt virus were in good agreement with the ob - served enrichment of virus near the MTOC starting at (cid:122) 25 min to 40 min p . i . This reflects the half - time of virus pene - tration of endosomes which is (cid:122) 15 min ( Greber et al . , 1993 ) . To confirm that the above measured speeds were truly derived from cytosolic viruses , we analyzed the trafficking of an endosomal mutant Ad2 , ts1 , in TC7 / MAP4 / MTB— GFP cells and in parental TC7 cells . Unlike wt virus , ts1 had a population mean speed of (cid:50) 0 . 02 (cid:109) m / s in TC7 / MAP4 / MTB—GFP cells and (cid:49) 0 . 04 (cid:109) m / s in TC7 cells indi - cating slow minus - and plus end—directed net movements ( Table I ) . Accordingly , we have not observed ts1 virus ac - cumulation near the MTOC up to 60 min p . i . Like wt virus , ts1 showed a tailed distribution of ES , with the majority in the range of 0 . 1—0 . 2 (cid:109) m / s ( Fig . 6 E ) . In both cell types , about 22 . 5 % of the ES were less than 0 . 1 (cid:109) m / s . A typical ts1 trace in a MAP4 overexpressing cell shows how a virus particle moved from a location proximal to the MTOC to - wards the periphery with ES of up to 1 . 7 (cid:109) m / s and from there returned to an MTOC - near location with ES of up to 2 . 3 (cid:109) m / s ( Fig . 6 ) . Taken together , the data illustrate a dis - tinct dynamic behavior of wt and endosomal viruses fur - ther supporting the notion that wt Ad2 travels as a naked particle along MTs . Switching between Minus - and Plus End—directed Motions The observation that periods of minus end—directed Ad2 Figure 4 . Ad2 arrives in the cytosol in the absence of intact mi - crotubules . ( A ) HeLa cells were either kept in drug - free medium ( lanes 1—5 ) or pretreated with 20 (cid:109) M nocodazole at 37 (cid:56) C for 15 min ( lanes 6—11 ) . [ 35 S ] methionine Ad2 was bound in the cold , fol - lowed by warming in the presence or absence of nocodazole for indicated times . Surface - bound virus was digested with trypsin for 1 h in the cold followed by analysis of cleaved and trypsin - resistant hexon by SDS - PAGE and phosphorimaging as de - scribed earlier ( Greber et al . , 1993 ) . ( B ) HeLa cells were either treated with 20 (cid:109) M nocodazole ( panel b ) or left in drug - free me - dium ( panels a , c , and d ) as described in A . 50 (cid:109) g / ml wt Ad2 ( panels a and b ) or 50 (cid:109) g / ml ts1 virus ( panel c ) or no virus ( panel d ) was bound at 4 (cid:56) C for 90 min . Cells were warmed to 37 (cid:56) C in growth medium containing 20 mg / ml HRP with or without no - codazole for 15 min and then incubated in HRP - free medium for 15 min , fixed , and then prepared for thin section EM . HRP activ - ity was visualized using diaminobenzidine .

In fact , growing and shrinking MTs were readily observed in TC7 / MAP4 / MTB—GFP cells , preferentially in the cell periphery ( data not shown ) . Dynamic turnover of MTs can be experimentally elimi - nated by incubating cells in low concentrations of taxol or nocodazole ( Liao et al . , 1995 ; Waterman - Storer and Salmon , 1997 ) . To first test if dynamic MTs were needed for nuclear targeting of Ad2 we pretreated HeLa cells with 25 nM taxol for 30 min . Such treatment was sufficient to stabilize MTs against cold - induced depolymerization ( Fig . Figure 5 . Fast minus end— directed transport domi - nates over plus end—directed transport of wt Ad2 : analysis in TC7 / MAP4 / MTB—GFP cells ( A—E ) and TC7 paren - tal cells ( F ) . ( A and B ) Im - ages of TR - Ad2 were re - corded with intervals of 1 . 3 s starting 30 min p . i . ( time stamp displaying minutes : seconds . centiseconds ) .

Microtubule - dependent Adenovirus Motility In Vivo 665 1 , e and h ) . Ad2 - TR was bound to the surface and then in - ternalized in the presence of the drug for 75 min . Similar to control cells , the majority of virus particles were local - ized to the nuclear envelope ( Fig . 2 , g and h ) . Viral DNA was readily detected inside the nucleus at 180 min p . i . us - ing the FISH assay described above ( Fig . 3 b ) . Likewise , treatment of TC7 / MAP4 / MTB—GFP cells with low con - centrations of nocodazole ( 1—10 (cid:109) M for 15 min ) in the ab - sence of cold incubations neither affected the MT network nor virus targeting to the nucleus ( data not shown ) . We next analyzed Ad2 motility in MAP4 / MTB—GFP - express - ing TC7 cells in the presence of taxol or low nocodazole . As expected from the static entry analysis ( Fig . 2 B ) , the population mean speeds towards the MTOC and the pe - riphery were not significantly different from the control cells ( Table I ) . In cells treated with low concentrations of nocodazole , we also observed peak minus - and plus end— directed speeds of up to 1 . 7 (cid:109) m / s ( data not shown ) . Although the frequencies of either minus - or plus end— directed motions were significantly decreased in the pres - ence of taxol and the no movement frequencies were increased from 12 . 8 to 40 . 8 % , rapid switching between plus - and minus end—directed ES was readily observed , similar to control cells ( Fig . 7 , A and B ) . Within 2 . 6 s , sin - gle virus particles were frequently switching from (cid:49) 0 . 4 (cid:109) m / s to (cid:50) 0 . 4 (cid:109) m / s and vice versa , suggesting that stable MTs supported rapid bidirectional transport . In a number of cultured cells , including polarized cells , MTs can be detached from the MTOC and may occur as migrating antiparallel structures with free minus and plus ends at steady - state conditions ( Keating et al . , 1997 ) . We therefore tested if the rapid switching between minus - and plus end—directed motions of wt Ad2 occurred near the MTOC in TC7 / MAP4 / MTB—GFP cells that were reestab - lishing MTs after nocodazole wash out . Such cells are ex - pected to have a minimal amount of MTs that are not anchored to the MTOC . As indicated in Fig . 7 C , a perinu - clear MT aster formed after 1—2 min of nocodazole wash out . MTOC - near viruses were observed to switch between plus - and minus end—directed motions at ES of 0 . 3—0 . 4 (cid:109) m / s as indicated by a typical particle trace ( Fig . 7 C ) . Al - though these amplitudes were somewhat smaller than those in the control or the taxol - treated cells , they were significantly larger than the randomly directed mean ES in nocodazole - treated HeLa ( 0 . 15 and 0 . 17 (cid:109) m / s , Table I ) or TC7 cells ( data not shown ) . We thus concluded that single cytosolic Ad2 particles were able to engage with both plus - and minus end—directed motors and thus move bidirec - tionally along not highly dynamic MTs .

ES were calculated from the elementary motion steps of selected virus particles that were located well within the cell and were able to move in at least five subsequent frames over a minimal distance of 0 . 5 (cid:109) m . ES were grouped according to their directionalities , MTOC ( minus end ) , periphery ( plus end ) , and no motility ( 0 ) , and characterized in terms of peak speeds , mean speeds , and frequencies .

The total amounts of ES was between 448 and 1 , 677 and derived from three to seven independent experiments analyzing 13—32 different virus par - ticles in 3—13 different cells , respectively . The mean plus - and minus end—directed speeds including the standard deviations were determined by averaging the corresponding mean velocities of individual particles .

The motor activity can be experimen - tally dislodged from cargo by overexpression of p50 / dy - namitin , a component of the dynein - associated dynactin complex ( Echeverri et al . , 1996 ; Burkhardt et al . , 1997 ; Ahmad et al . , 1998 ) . We therefore tested if transient over - expression of human dynamitin in HeLa cells affected nuclear targeting of Ad2 . Control cells transfected with eGFP - encoding plasmid DNA showed efficient nuclear targeting of TR - labeled Ad2 at 60 min p . i . ( Fig . 8 A , pan - els a—c ) . HeLa cells cotransfected with GFP and dynamitin plasmids showed reduced nuclear targeting of Ad2 , partic - ularly at high levels of overexpression ( Fig . 7 A , panels d—f ) . At moderate dynamitin overexpressions , variable levels of nuclear targeting occurred , perhaps due to incom - plete inactivation of the dynactin complex . To test if dynamitin overexpression interfered with Ad2 escape from endosomes , we assayed the release of cointer - nalized fluid - phase dextran - FITC from endosomes to the cytosol upon Ad2 infection in a qualitative assay , similar to the HRP assay described in Fig . 4 B .

Microtubule - dependent Adenovirus Motility In Vivo 667 lysine - fixable 10 - kD dextran , which readily diffuses from the cytosol to the nucleus . Wt Ad2 and , as a control , the mutant ts1 were bound to control cells or cells overex - pressing dynamitin and internalized in the presence of dextran for 15 min , followed by a 15 - min chase in the ab - sence of dextran . About 80 % of the cells infected with wt virus showed a prominent diffuse dextran pattern in the cytosol and the nucleus , independent of dynamitin overex - pression ( Fig . 8 B , panels a—c ) . Similar results were ob - tained with a control plasmid overexpressing the loop 1 re - gion of the hexon protein ( see Materials and Methods ) ( data not shown ) . In contrast , none of the more than 200 analyzed cells infected with ts1 virus showed any diffuse cytoplasmic or nuclear dextran staining , but contained nu - merous punctuate FITC signals in the cytoplasm indicative of endosomes or lysosomes ( Fig . 8 B , panels d—f ) . These results were in full agreement with the HRP fluid - phase uptake experiments ( Fig . 4 B ) and suggested that dyna - mitin overexpression did not appreciably affect Ad2 re - lease from endosomes . To quantitate the effects of dynamitin overexpression on Ad2 trafficking , we compared the extents and frequen - cies of the minus and plus end—directed ES in dynamitin overexpressing HeLa cells with control and nocodazole - treated cells . Virus motility at the cell surface was , in addi - tion , determined to account for cytosol - independent parti - cle motion . As shown by an ES population analysis ( Fig . 9 B ) and exemplified by representative particle traces ( Fig . 9 A ) , dynamitin overexpression significantly reduced the ex - tents and also the frequencies of the minus end—directed ES . The mean minus end—directed speed of 0 . 22 (cid:109) m / s was significantly smaller than the plus end—directed mean speed of 0 . 30 (cid:109) m / s ( Tables I and II ) , resulting in a plus end—directed population speed of 0 . 06 (cid:109) m / s compared with a minus end—directed speed of 0 . 03 (cid:109) m / s in control cells ( Fig . 9 B , panels a and b ) ( Table I ) . As pointed out earlier , not all minus end—directed transport of Ad2 was blocked by dynamitin overexpression . This was illustrated also by the maximal minus end—directed ES ( (cid:122) 2 (cid:109) m / s ) and a mean minus end speed , which was significantly higher than in nocodazole - treated cells ( Table II ) . This re - sult may either reflect the heterogenous expression levels of dynamitin or , alternatively , indicate some form of dy - nein / dynactin - independent minus end transport of Ad2 . In contrast to the effect of dynamitin on the minus end mi - gration of Ad2 , dynamitin overexpression did not signifi - cantly affect the mean plus end—directed velocity , as illus - trated by the predominantly peripheral virus localization in these cells ( Fig . 8 A and Fig . 9 A , panel b 2 ) ( Tables I and II ) . However , dynamitin overexpression significantly increased the frequency of plus end motions to 31 . 5 from 25 . 5 % in control cells or 25 . 8 % in GFP - expressing cells ( legend of Table I , chi square test at 95 % confidence ) . In - terestingly , dynamitin overexpression also significantly in - creased the fraction of immobile particles to 50 . 9 from 41 . 4 % in control cells . The validity of our chi square analy - sis and of the sample volumes were confirmed by the fact that there were no significant differencies between the plus , the minus , and the no movement frequencies in con - trol HeLa cells compared with GFP - expressing HeLa cells . That the expression of GFP had no significant effects on Ad2 trafficking was further supported by the observa - Figure 7 .

Ad2 - TR was internalized for 20— 40 min into TC7 / MAP4 - GFP cells not treated ( A ) or treated ( B ) with taxol ( 100 nM ) . Alternatively , cells were pretreated with no - codazole ( 20 (cid:109) M ) for 15 min in growth medium , incubated with Ad2 - TR in cold binding medium in the presence of nocodazole for 60 min , followed by virus internalization for 30 min in the presence of nocodazole and 1—2 min after removal of the drug ( C ) .

Taken together , the data show that dynamitin overex - pression strongly affected but not completely blocked mi - nus end—directed transport of cytosolic Ad2 . It increased the frequency of plus end movements and supported long - range movements over several micrometers towards the periphery . In contrast , no long - range movements , either MTOC - or periphery - directed , were observed in noco - dazole - treated cells . In these cells , short - range random movements ( covering areas of 5—10 (cid:109) m 2 ) with mean speeds of 0 . 15 (cid:109) m / s were observed ( Fig . 9 A , panel c ) ( Ta - ble I ) . The motilities in nocodazole - treated cells were ap - parently randomly directed without any significant differ - ence between plus - and minus end—directed mean speeds ( Table II ) . These motilities were , however , not an artefact of our experimental set up , since they were significantly larger than the motilities of surface - bound virus ( Fig . 9 , A and B , panels d ) ( Table I ) . Possibly , in nocodazole - treated cells viruses were either moving on short MT fragments resistant to the drug , or they were using some MT - inde - pendent form of intracellular motility . Discussion In this study we have analyzed the dynamic properties of incoming Ad2 at various stages of entry . Our results iden - tify the major minus end—directed motor complex , dynein / dynactin , as a key mediator of nuclear targeting of Ad2 . The data support the notion that the viral DNA remains wrapped by the capsid until arrival at the nuclear mem - brane . Capsids therefore are expected to contain all the necessary information for nuclear targeting . Virus parti - cles on the cell surface remain apparently immobile , prob - ably bound to a primary receptor ( Bergelson et al . , 1997 ) . Figure 8 . Dynamitin overex - pression inhibits nuclear tar - geting of incoming Ad2 , but not release of a fluid - phase endosomal marker into the cytosol .

Microtubule - dependent Adenovirus Motility In Vivo 669 They are then captured into endosomes , penetrate the en - dosomal membrane , and then move as naked cytosolic particles along MTs to the MTOC . Our dynamic analysis at a resolution of up to one frame per second shows that minus end migration occurs stepwise with maximal ES of 2 . 6 (cid:109) m / s , occasionally interrupted by periods of almost equally fast plus end—directed motions or periods of stall - ing . Consequently , the population speeds towards the MTOC are in the order of micrometers per minute , in agreement with the observation that wt virus starts to ac - cumulate at the MTOC and the nuclear envelope at 30—40 min p . i . In contrast to wt virus , the endosomal escape - defective mutant virus ts1 does not end up near the peri - nuclear MTOC , but remains randomly distributed in the cytoplasm , despite the fact that it undergoes fast minus - and plus end—directed elementary motion steps .

First , MT depolymerization with nocodazole effectively inhibited wt virus transport to the nuclear envelope and left capsids in the cytosol . These cytosolic capsids contain genomic DNA and are competent to translocate to the nu - clear envelope and release their DNA into the nucleus if MTs are restored . Interestingly , microinjected viral DNA core structures lacking the remainder capsid components were not imported into the nucleus , but instead remained aggregated in the cytoplasm ( data not shown ) . These re - sults show that cytosolic capsid structures and intact MTs are of functional importance to nuclear import of vi - ral DNA . The second evidence favoring transport of naked rather than endosomal viruses to the MTOC is based on the dif - ferent dynamic properties of wt virus compared with the endosomal ts1 mutant . Whereas wt Ad2 moves predomi - nantly to the MTOC with population mean speeds be - tween 0 . 03 and 0 . 21 (cid:109) m / s ( depending on the cell type ) , plus - and minus end—directed movements occur with about equal frequencies and extents in the case of the mutant ts1 . Ts1 - positive vesicles contain fluid - phase endocytic mark - ers , such as HRP or fluorescent dextran indicating that they were of endocytic origin . Unlike transferrin - contain - ing endosomes ( Daro et al . , 1996 ) ts1 did not accumulate near the MTOC within 60 min p . i . , suggesting that the ts1 vesicles are perhaps routed towards lysosomes rather than a perinuclear recycling compartment . In accordance with this possibility , ts1 was degraded in a lysosomal protease - dependent manner starting at (cid:122) 60 min p . i . ( Greber et al . , 1996 ) . MTs are , however , involved in ts1 trafficking , since nocodazole largely inhibited long - range ts1 movements ( data not shown ) . Like in the case of wt virus , dynamic MTs are not required for ts1 motility . Elimination of the most dynamic MTs by taxol not only increased the mean minus - and plus end—directed speeds of ts1 , but also in - creased the frequency of no movements , thus supporting the notion that dynamic MTs may facilitate establishing MT contact with cargo ( Goodson et al . , 1997 ) . The Nature of Ad2 Movements through the Cytosol The analysis of intracellular wt virus dynamics in nondrug - treated cells shows that between 12 . 8 and 41 . 4 % of the ele - mentary motion steps were less than 0 . 1 (cid:109) m / s depending on the cell line . This was below the resolution of our set up and was therefore scored as no movement . Almost all the particles were , however , closely associated with MTs as suggested by confocal microscopy and earlier EM studies ( data not shown ) ( Luftig and Weihing , 1975 ; Weatherbee et al . , 1977 ; Miles et al . , 1980 ) . It is therefore possible that cytosolic virus first attaches to MTs and remains immobile until some motor - dependent transport happens . Transport to the MT minus ends ( or to a lesser extent also the plus ends ) occurred by two types of motion , a slow transport mode working at micrometers per minute and a fast mode working at micrometers per second . Both modes are made up of numerous ES with peak speeds in the order of 0 . 5— 2 . 6 (cid:109) m / s . The fast mode is reminiscent of vesicular traf - ficking ( Presley et al . , 1998 ) and typically lasted for several seconds resulting in efficient virus advancement to the MTOC . It is not interrupted by stalling or plus end— directed motions . Unlike the fast mode , the slow mode can last for minutes and is composed of alternating minus - and plus end—directed ES , which are typically less than 0 . 5 (cid:109) m / s in magnitude . Since these motions often follow a quasi - linear track and are completely eliminated in the presence of nocodazole , they are most likely mediated by MT - dependent motors . Rapid switching between plus - and minus end—directed motions is not only detected in nondrug - treated cells , but also in taxol - incubated cells and , importantly , in cells recovering from nocodazole treatment immediately after drug wash out . In the latter case , most of the MTs that were not anchored to the MTOC , including antiparallel MTs , are expected to be eliminated ( Keating et al . , 1997 ) . We therefore concluded that a single Ad2 particle engages with both plus - and minus end—directed motor activities . The ability to use both types of motors might be impor - tant for Ad entry into polarized cells or , possibly , for vi - rus egress from infected polarized or nonpolarized cells . Whether , and if so , how the motor activities are coordi - nated is subject of future studies . Besides motor regula - tion , MTs and associated proteins could have a potential role in determinating the directionality of transport . Inter - estingly , both the mean and also the peak periphery - directed speeds of wt Ad2 and endosomal mutant virus were significantly decreased in cells overexpressing the MT - binding domain of MAP4 compared with the parental cells . Whether this effect is related to the observed in - crease in MT stability in the MAP4 / MTB—GFP—express - ing cells ( Nguyen et al . , 1997 ) is not known . MT - dependent transport of cargo can , in principle , be driven by the energetics of plus end MT depolymerization and dynamic attachment of the motor to the shortening fil - ament ( Waters and Salmon , 1996 ) . Our data with taxol - stabilized MTs show that highly dynamic MTs are not re - quired for long - range Ad2 transport . Dynamic MTs may , however , increase the probability of virus contact with MTs , since taxol strongly increased the fraction of nonmo - tile viruses . Dynein / Dynactin Is a Major Minus End—directed Motor for Ad2 Like other MT - based motors , the major minus end—directed motor dynein produces directed movement by a confor - mational change upon ATP - hydrolysis ( Howard , 1997 ; Hi - rokawa , 1998 ; Hirokawa et al . , 1998 ) . Dynein is a protein complex of three different subunits of various stoichiome - tries translocating along MTs at speeds faster than 0 . 5 (cid:109) m / s ( Schroer , 1996 ) . Dynein attaches to cargo , such as cellular vesicles and mitotic chromosomes via the dynactin com - plex . Overexpression of the dynactin component dyna - mitin has been shown to disrupt the dynactin complex on the kinetochore of mitotic chromosomes ( Echeverri et al . , 1996 ) and also affect vesicular trafficking in interphase cells ( Burkhardt et al . , 1997 ; Ahmad et al . , 1998 ) . Our re - sults show that overexpression of human dynamitin signifi - cantly inhibits nuclear targeting of Ad2 in HeLa cells and , on M a y 9 , 2006 www . j c b . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Suomalainen et al . Microtubule - dependent Adenovirus Motility In Vivo 671 to a lesser extent , also in monkey TC7 cells ( data not shown ) . It is unlikely that dynamitin overexpression inhib - ited Ad2 penetration , since a fluid - phase endocytic marker is delivered to the cytosol upon Ad2 infection , indepen - dent of dynamitin overexpression . Accordingly , general receptor - mediated endocytic uptake is known to occur without intact MTs ( Gruenberg et al . , 1989 ; Rickard and Kreis , 1996 ) . Although not all minus end—directed trans - port of wt virus was blocked in the presence of excess dy - namitin , our data imply that some component of the dynactin complex directly or indirectly interacts with cyto - solic Ad2 capsid . Owing to the linearity of the remaining minus end—directed movements , this motility is unlikely caused by Brownian motion ( Beckerle and Porter , 1982 ) . It rather reflects either some dynein / dynactin - independent , but MT - dependent motor activity or , possibly , the heter - ogenous expression levels of dynamitin ( Burkhardt et al . , 1997 ) . Interestingly , dynamitin overexpression signifi - cantly increased the frequencies of no movements and of plus end—directed movements , which could suggest that a plus end—directed motor attaches to a site on the virus or even on a dynactin component , which is normally occu - pied by dynein / dynactin ( Blangy et al . , 1997 ) . With the advent of increasingly detailed models of mo - tor interactions with MTs for kinesin ( Woehlke et al . , 1997 ) and dynein ( Gee et al . , 1997 ) and increasing struc - tural understanding of kinesin(cid:213)s directionality ( Case et al . , 1997 ; Henningsen and Schliwa , 1997 ) , a more detailed knowledge of the mechanism of dynein motor directional - ity and interactions with simple cargo is desired . We al - ready know much about the cell biology of motors in - volved in vesicular transport , such as dynein(cid:213)s role in trafficking of the intermediate compartment ( Presley et al . , 1997 ) , Golgi vesicles ( Fath et al . , 1997 ; Holleran et al . , 1998 ; Lippincott - Schwartz , 1998 ; Vaisberg et al . , 1996 ) , mature phagosomes ( Blocker et al . , 1997 ) , and endosomes ( Aniento et al . , 1993 ; Goodson et al . , 1997 ) , but we know very little about MT - dependent trafficking of nonmem - branous organelles or of viral structures . Owing to its rela - tive simplicity and high entry efficiency , Ad offers yet another opportunity to get additional insights into the complex regulation of polarized cytoplasmic trafficking . In addition , any successful application of gene transfer proto - cols requires overcoming of numerous subcellular barriers including the cytoplasm . Our present study , together with a recent report on Herpes virus ( Sodeik et al . , 1997 ) , indi - cates that DNA viruses can overcome the cytoplasmic bar - rier by packaging their genomes into a capsid structure , which is capable of using the minus end—directed MT - dependent dynein motor . Our present study is the first dynamic and functional analysis of an incoming viral structure . It demonstrates that individual Ad2 particles engage not only with a minus end—directed motor for DNA delivery into the nucleus , but also interact with a fast plus end—directed activity working at micrometer per second speeds . In HeLa and TC7 cells , the plus end—directed motions are of lower ef - ficiency than the minus end motions , allowing nuclear targeting of virus at population speeds in the order of micrometers per minute . It is likely that long - range cyto - plasmic motility of nucleic acids generally requires some form of active transport as demonstrated also for mRNAs in oocytes ( Bassell and Singer , 1997 ; Gr(cid:159)nert and St . Johnston , 1996 ) . For optimal efficiency of future synthetic or semisynthetic nucleic acid delivery systems viral and / or cellular elements may therefore be used to facilitate direc - tional movement through the cytoplasm .
