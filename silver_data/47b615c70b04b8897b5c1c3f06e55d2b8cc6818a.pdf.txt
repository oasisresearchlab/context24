One of our main conclusions was that the vast majority of loops are anchored at CTCF / cohesin - binding sites whose motifs are oriented in a convergent fashion , i . e . , the motifs point at one another . We arrived at this conclusion by analyzing peaks where the two corre - sponding peak loci each contained a single CTCF - binding motif . We performed this analysis in eight different cell lines . It has come to our attention that , in this analysis , we inadvertently used the wrong peak ﬁle for one of the eight cell lines ( GM12878 ) . In addition to peaks in which there was a unique motif at each of the two peak loci , this ﬁle , which had been generated by a preliminary version of our code , included peaks whenever there was ( 1 ) a unique motif at one peak locus and ( 2 ) a unique motif on the opposite strand at the other peak locus . We have now redone the analysis using the correct ﬁle . As a result , we found that several numbers on page 1675 of the main text and page S73 of the Extended Experimental Procedures , as well as Figure 6D , need to be adjusted as shown below . The correct list of motifs associated with each loop anchor , together with their orientations , has been uploaded to the Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO ) at the original accession number for the paper , GEO : GSE63525 . These corrections do not affect the numbers for the other seven cell lines and do not modify the conclusions of the paper in any way . The main text corrections from page 1675 are shown below , with the correct numbers underlined and the original text numbers in brackets . ‘‘If CTCF sites were randomly oriented , one would expect all four orientations to occur equally often . But when we examined the 2 , 857 [ 4 , 322 ] peaks in GM12878 where the two corresponding peak loci each contained a single CTCF - binding motif , we found that the vast majority ( 90 % [ 92 % ] ) of motif pairs are convergent ( Figures 6D and 6E ) . Overall , the presence , at pairs of peak loci , of bound CTCF sites in the convergent orientation was enriched 102 - fold over random expectation ( Extended Experimental Procedures ) . The convergent orientation was overwhelmingly more frequent than the divergent orientation , despite the fact that divergent motifs also lie on opposing strands : in GM12878 , the counts were 2 , 574 - 10 [ 3 , 971 - 78 ] ( 257 - fold [ 51 - fold ] enrichment , convergent versus divergent ) ; in IMR90 , 1 , 456 - 5 ( 291 - fold ) ; in HMEC , 968 - 11 ( 88 - fold ) ; in K562 , 723 - 2 ( 362 - fold ) ; in HUVEC , 671 - 4 ( 168 - fold ) ; in HeLa , 301 - 3 ( 100 - fold ) ; in NHEK , 556 - 9 ( 62 - fold ) ; and in CH12 - LX , 625 - 8 ( 78 - fold ) . This pattern suggests that a pair of CTCF sites in the convergent orientation is required for the formation of a loop . The observation that looped CTCF sites occur in the convergent orientation also allows us to analyze peak loci containing multiple CTCF - bound motifs to predict which motif instance plays a role in a given loop . In this way , we can associate nearly two - thirds of peak loci ( 8 , 325 [ 8 , 175 ] of 12 , 903 , or 64 . 5 % [ 63 . 4 % ] ) with a single CTCF - binding motif . The speciﬁc orientation of CTCF sites at observed peaks provides evidence that our peak calls are biologically correct . Because randomly chosen CTCF pairs would exhibit each of the four orientations with equal probability , the near - perfect association between our loop calls and the convergent orientation could not occur by chance ( p < 10 - 1 , 185 [ 10 - 1 , 900 ] , binomial distribution ) . ’’ The Extended Experimental Procedures corrections from page S73 are shown below , with the correct numbers underlined and the original text numbers in brackets . ‘‘Out of 2857 [ 4322 ] peaks where we could localize both anchors down to unique motifs , we observed that 2574 ( 90 % ) [ 3971 ( 92 % ) ] of the peaks contained a pair of motifs in a convergent orientation . ’’ ‘‘ . In this manner , we localized 1334 [ 1184 ] peak loci to unique CTCF motifs in GM12878 . In total , we were able to localize 8325 [ 8175 ] of 12903 GM12878 peak loci to unique motifs . ’’ Cell 162 , 687 – 689 , July 30 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . 687 A B C E D F Figure 6 .
