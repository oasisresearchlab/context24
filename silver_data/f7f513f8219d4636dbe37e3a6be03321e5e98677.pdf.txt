Adult human osteoblastic cells were grown in a native type I collagen gel . Proliferation and viability analy - ses showed that cells rapidly stopped dividing and became blocked in the G0G1 phase ( 91 % on day 13 ) . Carboxyfluo - rescein diacetate cell staining and flow cytometry showed that osteoblasts were viable for the first 16 days and then viability decreased ( 58 % viable cells on day 22 ) . Osteo - blasts were able to retract the matrix . Betaglycerophosphate ( b GP ) stimulated the deposition of mineral particles in the collagen network , and electron probe microanalysis showed that they were principally calcium and phosphorus , with a Ca / P ratio of about 1 . 7 . Various times of b GP supply were tested . We compared 10 mM b GP added only once at day 0 , or continuously from day 0 , day 8 , or day 21 . Mineral - ization was observed in conditions where b GP was added at day 0 . Furthermore , 10 mM b GP added once during gel preparation was sufficient to induce mineralization with mineral accumulation up to day 15 whereas the speed of the gel contraction decreased . In every condition , cultures ex - pressed high alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) levels as early as day 3 , which decreased afterwards . These kinetics might explain why the other conditions did not prove favorable to the mineralization process . The model was used to study the influence of blocking gel retraction . Blocking retraction de - layed the ALP activity decrease , but had no effect on min - eralization . In conclusion , human adult osteoblasts cultured in native collagen gel stopped proliferation and underwent mineralization very early . This model should be used to investigate the influence of effectors on the early stages of culture . Key words : Osteoblast — 3 - Dimensional culture — Min - eralization — Alkaline phosphatase — Collagen gel . Bone cells produce organic matrix that mineralizes to form calcified tissue . Most in vitro studies of mineralization used monolayer cultures of osteoblastic murine [ 1 – 3 ] or avian origin [ 4 ] cells , cell lines established from osteosarcomas [ 5 – 7 ] , or normal human cells [ 8 , 9 ] . Cells were cultured until they formed multilayers with nodules [ 10 ] . Mineral - ization was observed only after the nodule formation oc - curred . Phosphate , provided by b - glycerophosphate ( b GP ) was used routinely in most of the studies on bone cell min - eralization in culture . Supplementation of culture medium with b GP induced osteogenesis and promoted hydroxyapa - tite deposition around osteoblasts [ 1 , 11 ] . The role of alka - line phosphatase ( ALP ) during the mineralization process , as well as the implication of b GP only as a phosphate source or as a modulator of bone cell metabolic activity is not clearly established [ 12 , 13 ] . Using monolayer cultures , Tenenbaum [ 14 ] reported inhibition of ALP activity , whereas Chung et al . [ 15 ] found that b GP had no effect on ALP . The aim of this study was to test a 3D system in order to assess whether the matrix maturation phase , well known in 2D conditions [ 10 , 11 ] , is needed before initiation of the mineralization process . The present study uses an in vitro system that closely mimics a tissue - like environment with a three - dimensional culture in a type I collagen gel . Adult human osteoblastic cells that retained their osteoblastic phe - notype during the first few passages were used [ 16 ] . We first characterized cell proliferation pattern and viability within collagen gels as well as cell ability to retract the matrix . This ability was well described for fibroblastic cells [ 17 ] and for other osteoblastic cell types [ 18 ] . Then we examined the effect of various timings in b GP administra - tion on the mineralization process and how this mineraliza - tion process was modulated in free - floating gels as com - pared with nonretracting gels . Material and Methods Cell Culture Bone fragments were taken during surgical hip replacement from subjects aged 50 – 80 years and digested with trypsin and collage - nase [ 16 ] . Cells collected from the second and the third digestions were grown in Earle’s Minimum Essential Medium / MEM - Ham F12 ( 1 : 1 ) supplemented with 1 mM pyruvate , 2 mM glutamine , 50 m g / ml ascorbic acid , 5 m M non - essential aminoacids , 50 m g / ml penicillin and streptomycin , and 2 % Ultroser ( Gibco BRL ) . Cells were used between the second and sixth passages . Human skin was obtained by surgical excision from young patients undergoing plastic surgery of the ears . Fibroblasts from explants were propagated in serial subcultures . The cells were grown in MEM supplemented with 10 % calf serum ( CS ) . Collagen Lattice Preparation Gels were prepared according to Bell et al . [ 17 ] using type I acid Correspondence to : J . Frey Calcif Tissue Int ( 2000 ) 66 : 35 – 42 ©2000 Springer - Verlag New York Inc . soluble calf skin collagen purified as previously described [ 19 ] . This preparation was hexosamine free , contained less than 3 % type III collagen , and type I collagen contained telopeptides . Lattices were prepared in 60 mm bacteriological Petri dishes by rapidly mixing 2 × 10 5 cells with 1 . 5 ml collagen ( 2 . 4 mg / ml in 0 . 1 % acetic acid ) in a final volume of 5 ml using 1 . 76 × concentrated medium . Experiments were carried out in MEM supplemented with 10 % new - born CS . Gels contained 10 mM b GP , except where otherwise stated . The culture medium was generally changed after 8 days , at the end of retraction . Fixed gels were made by placing an o - ring of scrynel nylon ( 3 mm wide ) at the bottom of a Petri dish then pouring the gel mixture into the dish [ 20 ] , so that the gel did not contract . Viability of Osteoblasts Cultivated in Lattice Cell viability was checked using carboxyfluorescein diacetate ( CFDA , Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) , which passively crosses cell membranes and is converted to a polar fluorescent product by intracellular esterases . Cells were released from the gel by colla - genase digestion : lattices were rinsed three times with PBS , di - gested with 1 mg / ml collagenase Sigma type V at 37°C for up to 30 minutes , depending on the age of the lattice . They were col - lected by centrifugation and rinsed with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . 2 × 10 5 cells were suspended in 200 m l PBS and incubated with 30 m g CDFA for 30 minutes at 37°C , 5 % CO 2 . The CFDA was prepared fresh from a stock solution ( 20 mg / ml in acetone ) kept at −20°C . The cells were rinsed twice with PBS , suspended in 200 m l PBS , and analyzed by flow cytometry in a Facstar Plus cell sorter ( Becton Dickinson ) equipped with an argon laser emitting 250 mW excitation at 488 nm . Five thousand cells were analyzed in each sample . Specific green fluorescence due to fluorescein was analyzed through a 530 ± 40 nm bandpass filter . Cell Cycle and DNA Assay Cells were released from the gel by collagenase digestion , as de - scribed for studies of viability . For cell cycle analysis , cells were permeabilized with 70 % ethanol at + 4°C for 30 minutes , then pelleted by centrifugation and incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes with 25 m l ribonuclease A ( 1000 IU / ml ) per 25 × 10 4 cells . PBS ( 100 m l ) was added and the cells were stained by adding propidium iodide ( PI ) to a final concentration of 50 m g / ml . Flow cytometry analysis was performed with a Facstar Plus Cell sorter ( Becton Dickinson ) . Gating was performed using width - versus - area dot plots to exclude doublets and multiplets . Data were processed using CellFit software . A total of 10 , 000 cells were acquired for each sample . Red fluorescence signals due to PI emission were collected through a 585 / 40 nm bandpass filter . DNA was assayed with bisbenzimide [ 21 ] . Determination of ALP Cells were released from the gel by collagenase digestion as de - scribed above . They were pelleted by centrifugation , suspended in 0 . 5 ml 50 mM Tris , 0 . 15 M NaCl , pH 7 . 4 , and sonicated at + 4°C . The lysate was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2500 rpm , and 20 m l of supernatant was used to assay ALP using a p - nitrophenylphos - phate substrate ( Merck n° 12950 ) . In some experiments , cells grown in monolayers in MEM - Ham F12 - Ultroser medium were used as controls . Cells were harvested by trypsinization , pelleted by centrifugation , then treated as the cells collected from the gel . Protein in the supernatant was measured by the method of Lowry et al . [ 22 ] . Mineralization Analyses Von Kossa staining was carried out after 2 – 4 weeks in culture . The lattices were fixed by immersion in 10 % formalin in PBS for 4 hours , processed , and embedded in paraffin : sections were cut ( 5 m m ) and stained by the Von Kossa technique . Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and energy - dispersive X - ray microanalysis were done on lattices rinsed in PBS , fixed with 1 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer pH 7 . 4 , postfixed with 1 % OsO 4 in phosphate buffer , dehydrated in an ethanol series , and embedded in Epon . Ultrathin sections were cut and stained with 7 % uranyl acetate in methanol and lead citrate . They were examined under a 1 200 EX Jeol electron microscope , and the mineralized areas were analyzed with an energy - dispersive spectrometer ( EDS Tracor ) . The accelerating voltage was 100 KeV and the current was chosen to limit the damage caused by the beam . For calcium and phosphorus assays , minerals were solubilized with 5 % perchloric acid . The calcium ( Ca ) concentration was mea - sured by flame ionization ( Spectrometer Eppendorf ) and phospho - rus was assayed by the molybdate vanadate reaction ( Boehringer Mannheim , Germany , n°124 974 ) . Statistical Analysis All experiments were done in triplicate . The results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation . Statistical analysis using the Mann - Whitney U test determined the difference in medians . Significance was assigned at the P < 0 . 05 level . Results Cell Growth and Viability The proliferative state of osteoblasts grown in gels without b GP was studied by DNA measurement . The results ( Fig . 1 ) showed no increase in the DNA content per lattice during the culture , with a slight decrease in DNA observed from day 7 . Cell cycle was monitored along the cultures . After 2 days , 13 % of the cells were in the S phase . This ratio de - creased to 8 % at day 5 . At day 13 , 5 . 5 % of the cells were in the S phase , and most of the cells were arrested in the G0G1 phase ( 91 . 5 % ) . This profile was close to that of subconflu - ent monolayers on plastic substrate ( data not shown ) . Cell viability was checked by quantification of CFDA - positive cells . Figure 2 shows one representative graph ob - Fig . 1 . Proliferation of human osteoblasts in collagen type I gel . Lattices were prepared as described under Methods in medium without b GP .

The mean for three experiments showed 79 . 9 % ± 1 . 7 of viable cells at day 2 , 78 . 0 % ± 2 . 29 at day 8 ( statistically no different from day 2 ) , and a sig - nificant decrease of viability seen from day 16 : 70 . 1 % ± 1 . 49 ( P < 0 . 05 ) at day 16 and 56 . 5 % ± 1 . 88 ( P < 0 . 05 ) at day 21 . Mineralization Human osteoblastic cells were seeded in a collagen gel and fed with 10 mM b GP from the beginning . Von Kossa stain - ing performed at days 15 and 30 showed intense and ho - mogenous mineralization within the lattice sections ( Fig . 3 ) . Staining was darker at day 30 versus day 15 ( Fig . 3B ) . Von Kossa staining was negative when b GP was absent ( Fig . 3A ) . The mineral deposits were analyzed by X - ray micro - analysis . The spindle - shape crystallites observed on ultra - thin sections with transmission electron microscopy were composed of Ca and P with atomic Ca / P ratios of 1 . 75 ± 0 . 38 ; the theoretical value for hydroxyapatite crystals is 1 . 67 ( Fig . 4 ) . The involvement of the osteoblasts in mineralization was checked by comparing lattices populated with osteoblasts with lattices populated with human dermal fibroblasts . Ca and P were measured by chemical assays ( Table 1 ) . No mineralization occurred in the fibroblasts system up to day 16 , and the calcium content of the fibroblast lattices was less than 10 % of that in osteoblast lattices at day 23 . The Ca / P ratio was low ( 1 . 09 ) , and significantly lower than Ca / P ratio in osteoblast - populated lattices . Effect of b GP on Gel Contraction The effects of b GP on gel contraction were examined with b GP added to the initial lattice mixture . The rate of the collagen gel contraction by osteoblasts was affected by the presence of b GP ( Fig . 5 ) . Contraction was rapid during the first 20 hours , and the diameter of the gel stabilized at one - third of the initial diameter when b GP was added ; gel diameter continued to decrease , reaching almost one - fifth of the initial size in the controls without b GP . Effects of Various b GP Treatemts on Mineralization As mineralization requires b GP , we examined the influence of 10 mM b GP added either during lattice preparation or at various times during cell culture . In the experiment presented in Table 2 we compared giving b GP from the beginning of the culture to giving it only on days 8 or 21 ; mineralization was measured after 29 days of culture . No mineralization occurred in the absence of b GP . b GP addition at day 21 did not trigger mineraliza - tion , whereas adding it at day 8 promoted slight mineral - ization ( 0 . 53 m mol Ca per lattice ) . When b GP was present throughout the culture , the amount of Ca per lattice was at the highest level ( 10 . 3 m mol per lattice ) . When b GP was added from the beginning of the culture , mineral formation was measured throughout the culture pe - riod ( Fig . 6A ) . Minerals were detectable from day 8 and increased until day 23 in lattices containing 200 , 000 cells . Minerals were measurable as early as day 3 in lattices pre - Fig . 2 .

The most favorable conditions for induction of mineraliza - tion were also tested by giving b GP as a single administra - tion from day 0 to day 3 . This was sufficient to induce mineralization with an increase in Ca deposition until 15 days of culture ( Fig . 6B ) . Effect of b GP on ALP Activity : Comparison of 2 - D and 3 - D ALP activity in lattice cultures was assessed in comparison with cells grown in monolayers in the presence of b GP ( Table 3 ) . b GP had no effect on ALP activity in monolayer cultures . In contrast , it induced a large decrease in ALP activity in lattice cultures . In these lattices , ALP activity was only 50 % of that of cultures grown without b GP as early as the second day of culture . It is worthy to note that ALP activity decreased during culture even in the absence of b GP . Influence of Blocking Lattice Retraction Free retracting gels were compared with nonretracting gels ( Table 4 ) . In both systems , mineralization , consequent to addition of b GP from day 0 , was initiated between days 3 and 9 . Accumulation of minerals seemed to progress inde - Fig . 3 .

Ca / P contents were comparable in free gels and in fixed gels , at days 9 and 15 . In both systems , ALP activity decreased with time , but this decrease was slower in nonretracting gels : in free - floating gels , ALP activity at day 9 had decreased by 97 % whereas it had decreased by 90 % in nonretracting gels as compared with day 3 . Discussion Concerning the behavior of the osteoblasts in the three - dimensional type I collagen gel , cells rapidly stopped di - viding and the majority of cells were arrested in the G0G1 phase . The proliferative behavior of osteoblasts in free - floating type I collagen gels was similar to that of fibro - blasts , with very little proliferation [ 23 , 24 ] and an accu - mulation of fibroblasts in the G0G1 phase due to their in - teraction with collagen [ 25 ] . Talley - Ronsholdt et al . [ 26 ] , who have cultured osteoblasts in a 3 - D system , found that the osteoblasts exhibited growth , although the rate of mul - tiplication was lower than in monolayers . However , their experimental model differed from ours : they used cells from neonatal rat calvaria , and cell suspensions obtained by en - zymatic dissociation were placed directly in the gel ; in our system , we subcultured to eliminate contaminant cells . Oth - ers studies were carried out with human osteoblastic cells from normal or osteosarcoma origin seeded onto a collagen gel [ 27 , 28 ] . These systems allowed a cellular growth but with a reduced speed compared with plastic support . It is likely that some of the cells were migrating inside the gels , while cells remaining onto the surface continued to prolif - erate . In this work , we reported that adult human normal osteoblasts seeded into a collagen gel were not proliferative . These results support using this system because cells were quiescent . The decrease in cell viability observed from day 15 could be attributed to the small size of the retracted gels in which cells were confined . Osteoblasts and fibroblasts were able to retract the gels very rapidly and very completely . For this reason we chose human dermal fibroblasts as negative controls to check the specificity of mineralization . Indeed , it was previously described that high phosphate concentra - tions in the culture medium can precipitate Ca in the ab - sence of osteoblasts under appropriate conditions [ 13 , 29 ] . Therefore , fibroblastic controls were used rather than gels without cells because fibroblasts also contract the gel at about the same rate and form a tissue - like lattice similar to that formed by osteoblasts , whereas gels without cells were very loose and cannot be compared with cell - populated gels . Phosphorus and calcium were only detectable in fibroblast controls after 23 days in culture , and accounted for less than one - seventh of the osteoblast production under the same conditions . The Ca / P ratio of these controls was also lower than the ratio in osteoblasts , and was not characteristic of hydroxyapatite ( Table 1 ) . These results are explained by a low endogenous ALP activity in fibroblasts which did not allow the release of inorganic phosphorus from b GP . Lastly , with electron microscopy and energy - dispersive spectrometry analysis no crystal deposits in fibroblast - populated lattices were found . This work demonstrated that osteoblasts from human adults , seeded within a collagen type I gel , induced a min - eralization process in the presence of b GP . Some urchin - shaped mineral particles deposited in the collagen network were identified as hydroxyapatite crystals by electron probe analysis . Mineral deposition was also observed along col - lagen fibers . We have previously shown that these cells could mineralize the newly synthesized extracellular matrix after long - term ( at least 20 days ) cultures on plastic sub - strate [ 16 ] . We showed here that the mineralization process occurred during the first week . Mineralization was quanti - fiable from day 8 in a gel containing 200 , 000 cells and from day 3 in gels with 600 , 000 cells . In all the published in vitro mineralization studies it was found that organic phosphates must be added to the osteo - blast cultures as a source of inorganic phosphorus . b GP is usually used at 10 mM , corresponding to the plasmatic con - centration . b GP is generally added on days 15 – 21 in mono - layer cultures time , at which the extracellular matrix is formed in the presence of ascorbate , and nodules have ap - peared [ 10 , 30 ] . b GP induced mineralization of the osteoid - like matrix only in the nodules [ 31 ] . The main interest of our system is that the lattice provides the 3 - D environment pre - required for mineralization . Cultures grown on plastic for a long period develop multilayer nodules which provide 3 - D organization needed for mineralization , including cell - matrix and cell - cell interaction . In contrast , in our system , Table 1 .

Data were representative of three separate experiments and were expressed as the mean ± SD of triplicate gels ( * P < 0 . 05 ) . A . Rattner et al . : Mineralization of 3 - D Cultures of Human Osteoblast Cells 39 cell - cell contact was not much needed for inducing miner - alization . This raised the question of whether this exogenous ma - trix must mature before the b GP can induce mineralization . So we chose various times for the b GP supply : at the be - ginning of the culture , at the end of gel retraction ( day 8 ) , or later . b GP induced mineralization when it was added at the beginning of the culture , when cells expressed a high ALP activity . When b GP was added from day 8 , a slight miner - alization was seen , whereas nothing occurred later if b GP was added . As a consequence , a single administration of b GP at the beginning of the culture was sufficient to induce mineralization which increased thereafter . Furthermore , we showed that progression of mineralization did not require b GP nor ALP activity . In monolayer cultures , the sequence of events leading to mineralization were well described [ 30 , 31 ] and each se - quence was conditional for the following stage . An extra - cellular matrix is prerequired for mineral deposition and especially type I collagen , which is the major extracellular matrix protein of bone . Our results in 2 - D cultures were in agreement with those of Bellows et al . [ 31 ] with mineral - ization occurring after 17 days in culture . In contrast , our cultures in native type I collagen gel provided a suitable environment allowing an immediate mineralization process . It could be used to investigate the influence of effectors acting at the beginning of the culture , when mineralization is still controlled by osteoblasts . Several studies have shown that bone cells can respond to strain in vitro and that the response is modulated by the way of exertion of the strain [ 32 , 33 ] . In this work , we used a nonretracting gel model . In this case , continuous mechani - cal stress was generated by contraction of the osteoblasts themselves against the gel . The ALP activity seemed to decrease slightly slower in nonretracting gels , but no no - ticeable difference of mineralization was observed . In this system , two factors can be responsible for the modification of ALP activity : the effect of mechanical strain by itself and the 3 - D environment . It is conceivable that modulation of ALP activity by collagen type I is secondary to the specific integrinic receptors interacting with the collagen network ( personal data , unpublished ) , these integrins being differ - ently expressed in free retracting gels and in nonretracting gels . In fact , osteoblasts were in a different 3 - D environ - ment in relation to the available space : in free - floating gels , the retraction was complete at day 9 and at this point the cells were in greater proximity . Cells in fixed gels were maintained isolated all through the experiment . The strain generated in this model was relatively small and further experiments are needed to determine how mechanical static strain on the collagen gels could modulate the phenotypic expression of human osteoblasts . In conclusion , cultures of human osteoblastic cells grown in a network of native collagen gel rapidly form Table 2 .
