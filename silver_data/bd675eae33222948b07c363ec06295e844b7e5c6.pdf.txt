In addition , the ligand - induced endocytosis of the IL - 1 receptor and signaling events that are initiated after the internalization of the IL - 1 receptor presumably involving signaling endosomes are critical for the IL - 1 - induced gene expression . In this study , we investigate the role of membrane domains , commonly denoted as lipid rafts , in the IL - 1 - induced signal transduction . We demonstrate that the internalization of the IL - 1 receptor depends on the integrity of lipid rafts and that the disruption of lipid rafts strongly reduces the IL - 1 - induced gene expression . Interestingly , the IL - 1 - dependent signaling events activated at the plasma membrane are not influenced by the disruption of lipid rafts suggesting that IL - 1 signaling is initiated in a non - raft domain of the plasma membrane . Subsequently , the IL - 1 receptor is translocated to lipid rafts where receptor endocytosis occurs to enable the internalization - dependent IL - 1 signaling to activate the IL - 1 - induced gene expression .

A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 3 1 Introduction The pro - inflammatory cytokine interleukin - 1 ( IL - 1 ) affects nearly all cells and organs and is an important regulator of the immune response against invading organisms as well as a mediator of severe autoimmune and inflammatory diseases [ 1 ] . Two genes encode the IL - 1 proteins IL - 1  and IL - 1  . IL - 1  is constitutively expressed by virtually all non - hematopoietic cells [ 2 ] . Upon cell death by necrosis it is released and functions as an alarm molecule and initiates a cascade of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [ 2 ] . IL - 1  is a secreted and inducible cytokine primarily produced by monocytes , macrophages and dendritic cells [ 3 ] . The secretion of IL - 1  is preceded by the caspase - 1 - mediated proteolytic processing of the IL - 1  - precursor by the inflammasome [ 3 ] . IL - 1  and IL - 1  bind to the interleukin 1 receptor 1 ( IL - 1R1 ) , which subsequently recruits IL - 1R3 ( also known as the IL - 1 receptor accessory protein ( IL - 1RAcP ) ) [ 4 ] . The IL - 1 - dependent signal transduction is regulated by an intricate interplay of phosphorylation and ubiquitination events [ 5 - 7 ] . Although it has been known for years that IL - 1R1 is internalized upon ligand binding [ 8 - 15 ] , it was only recently shown that this process is critical for the IL - 1 - induced gene expression [ 16 - 18 ] . Thus , signaling via IL - 1R1 presumably depends on the function of signaling endosomes as platforms of signal transduction as shown for many other receptors [ 19 , 20 ] . Nevertheless , many mechanistic details involved in the internalization - dependent IL - 1 signaling remain elusive , e . g . the endocytic pathway involved in IL - 1R1 internalization . In general , clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent endocytic pathways are differentiated [ 21 ] . Most clathrin - independent endocytic pathways depend on specific membrane domains , denoted commonly as lipid rafts . Lipid rafts are highly dynamic , nanoscale , cholesterol - sphingolipid enriched assemblies of proteins and lipids that can be stimulated to form more stable micrometer - sized rafts regions supported by protein - protein , protein - lipid and lipid - lipid interactions [ 22 ] . Caveolae represent a subset of lipid rafts and are stabilized by A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 4 caveolins [ 23 ] . Besides the caveolae - associated endocytosis other raft - dependent / caveolae - independent endocytic pathways exist , e . g . the CLIC ( Clathrin - Independent Carrier ) / GEEC ( GPI - Enriched Endocytic Compartment ) pathway and the fast endophilin - mediated endocytosis ( FEME ) [ 21 , 23 - 25 ] . In addition to their important role in clathrin - independent endocytosis , lipid rafts serve as signaling platforms . Lipid rafts have been implicated in immunoreceptor signaling , e . g . in T - cell and B - cell receptor signaling [ 26 ] , and signal transduction mediated by G - protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) [ 27 ] . Moreover , Toll - like receptors ( TLRs ) are recruited to lipid rafts upon stimulation [ 28 - 30 ] . Since IL - 1R1 and TLRs have common downstream effectors , lipid rafts could also play a role in IL - 1R1 - dependent signaling . Previously , we applied a number of inhibitors of endocytic pathways and used siRNA - mediated knockdown of dynamins to investigate the role of IL - 1R1 endocytosis in IL - 1 signaling [ 17 , 18 ] . In these studies we demonstrated that the dynamin inhibitors dynasore and myristyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ( MiTMAB ) significantly reduced the IL - 1 - induced protein synthesis [ 17 ] . However , off - target effects of dynasore on lipid rafts were recently described and hence some dynasore - mediated effects could depend on its influence on lipid rafts and not on dynamin inhibition [ 31 - 33 ] . Furthermore , we showed that Pitstop 2 and monodansylcadaverine ( MDC ) , allegedly specific inhibitors of clathrin - dependent endocytosis , inhibited the IL - 1 - induced protein synthesis [ 17 ] . However , Pitstop 2 was later reported to inhibit also clathrin - independent endocytosis [ 34 - 36 ] . Moreover , MDC was recently shown to inhibit the clathrin - independent fast endophilin - mediated clathrin - independent endocytosis ( FEME ) pathway [ 25 ] . In sum , although the inhibition of the IL - 1 - induced IL - 1R1 endocytosis with different methods robustly reduced the IL - 1 - induced gene expression , it remained elusive whether the IL - 1R1 internalization is clathrin - dependent or clathrin - independent . A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 5 Thus , we investigated whether lipid rafts are involved in IL - 1R1 - mediated signaling from the plasma membrane and whether clathrin - independent endocytosis via lipid rafts is involved in the IL - 1 - induced internalization of IL - 1R1 . Here we report that the disruption of lipid rafts inhibits the IL - 1 - induced gene expression without affecting signal transduction events initiated at the plasma membrane , e . g . nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF -  B . However , the disruption of lipid rafts blocked the clathrin - independent ligand - induced internalization of IL - 1R1 and thereby the internalization - dependent IL - 1 signaling that is crucial for the IL - 1 - induced gene expression . 2 Materials and methods 2 . 1 Chemicals , antibodies and other proteins Filipin III from Streptomyces filipinensis and methyl -  - cyclodextrin were from Sigma .

After centrifugation for 15 min at 18 , 000 x g , the supernatant ( termed cell extract ) was decanted . For the GST pull - down an aliquot of cell extract ( ~ 200  g protein ) was incubated with 20  l of Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads ( GE Healthcare ) for 1 h with gentle rocking .

Cell were spun down at 300 g for 3 min , resuspended in Dulbecco’s PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry ( Accurri C6 FlowCytometer ) .

IL - 1R cells were grown in 6 - well dishes . The medium was removed and cells were washed twice with 1 ml ice - cold DPBS . Sulfo - NHS - SS - Biotin ( sulfosuccinimidyl - 2 - ( biotinamido ) ethyl - 1 , 3 - dithiopropionate ) in 2 ml ice - cold PBS was added to a final concentration of 0 . 5 mg / ml . The dishes were placed on a rocking platform and gently agitated for 30 min at 4°C . 100 µl of Quenching Solution were added to stop the reaction .

Cells were incubated three times with 5 mg / ml iodoacetamide in PBS on ice for 5 min to quench free SH groups . Cells were extracted with 100 µl lysis buffer ( as described in 2 . 3 ) on ice for 15 min . The lysate was transferred to a 1 . 5 ml microfuge tube and centrifuged for 15 min at 4°C at 18 , 000xg .

Differences in means were considered statistically significant if P < 0 . 05 . 3 Results 3 . 1 Disruption of lipid rafts inhibits the IL - 1 - induced protein expression In order to determine whether lipid rafts play a role in IL - 1 signaling we applied Filipin III from Streptomyces filipinensis , a compound that disrupts lipid rafts by sequestering cholesterol [ 38 ] . We investigated the effects of Filipin on the IL - 1 - induced phosphorylation and degradation of I  B  and the IL - 1 - induced synthesis of A20 and I  B  ( Fig . 1A and B ) . Interestingly , Filipin did not affect I  B  phosphorylation and degradation in the first 20 min of IL - 1 stimulation ( Fig . 1A and B ) . In addition , the phosphorylation and activation of the mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) p38  and c - jun N - terminal kinases ( JNK ) 1 / 2 was not affected by Filipin ( Fig . S1 ) . However , differences between control and Filipin - treated cells were observed after 30 - 60 min of IL - 1 stimulation . At ~ 30 min the IL - 1 - induced protein synthesis was detectable as shown by the increased levels of A20 , resynthesized I  B  and phosphorylated , resynthesized I  B  ( Fig . 1A , upper three panels , compare lanes 5 - 8 with lane 4 ) . Strikingly , lipid raft disruption by Filipin abolished the IL - 1 - induced A20 A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 11 expression and strongly reduced I  B  resynthesis ( Fig . 1A , lower four panels , and B , compare lane 7 with lane 8 ) . The reduced resynthesis of I  B  also caused decreased levels of phosphorylated I  B  after 30 - 60 min of IL - 1 stimulation ( Fig . 1A and B ) . To substantiate this result with another compound that disrupts lipid rafts we applied methyl -  - cyclodextrin ( M  CD ) ( Fig . 1C ) . M  CD extracts cholesterol from membranes and thereby destroys lipid raft organization [ 39 ] . M  CD reduced the IL - 1 - induced protein expression similar to Filipin ( Fig . 1C ) . After 50 min of IL - 1 stimulation the levels of A20 , I  B  and phosphorylated I  B  were strongly reduced ( Fig . 1C , compare lane 7 with lane 8 ) . However , M  CD slightly delayed the IL - 1 - induced degradation of I  B  suggesting that the M  CD - mediated depletion of cholesterol unlike treatment with Filipin had additional cholesterol - dependent or independent side effects as reported previously [ 39 ] . To further corroborate the role of lipid rafts in IL - 1 signaling , we detached IL - 1R cells prior to the stimulation with IL - 1 , because detachment of adherent cells is known to induce the internalization of raft proteins and thereby disrupts lipid rafts at the plasma membrane [ 40 , 41 ] . We confirmed that the detachment of IL - 1R cells results in the disappearance of the low - density detergent - insoluble membrane fractions in a flotation step gradient ( Fig . S2 , compare fractions 1 and 2 in A ( adherent ) with B ( suspended ) ) . Although the majority of IL - 1R1 was found in fractions of higher density , low amounts of IL - 1R1 could be detected in fractions of lower density together with caveolin - 1 in adherent IL - 1R cells ( Fig . S2A , fractions 1 and 2 ) . Interestingly , the IL - 1 stimulated I  B  phosphorylation and degradation in IL - 1R cells in suspension was comparable to the attached cells in the first 20 min ( Fig . 1D , compare lanes 3 and 5 with lanes 4 and 6 respectively ) . However , the detachment of IL - 1R cells inhibited the IL - 1 - induced protein expression ( Fig . 1D , compare lane 7 with lane 8 ) . In sum , we conclude that the disruption of lipid rafts does not affect early IL - 1 signaling events , but strongly A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 12 reduces the IL - 1 - induced protein synthesis suggesting a critical role for lipid rafts in IL - 1 signaling . 3 . 2 Disruption of lipid rafts reduces the IL - 1 - induced NF -  B - dependent gene expression The NFKBIA and TNFAIP3 genes encoding I  B  and A20 respectively are regulated by the transcription factor NF -  B [ 42 - 46 ] . Thus , we investigated whether the disruption of lipid rafts influences the IL - 1 - induced NF -  B - dependent gene expression with an NF -  B - dependent luciferase reporter system ( Fig . 2 ) . Filipin strongly reduced the IL - 1 - induced expression of I  B  and A20 after 1 h and 3 h of IL - 1 stimulation ( Fig . 2A ) . Strikingly , the IL - 1 - induced NF -  B - dependent luciferase reporter activity was significantly reduced after 3 h of IL - 1 stimulation in Filipin - treated cells ( Fig . 2B ) . At 1 h after IL - 1 stimulation no IL - 1 - induced luciferase activity was detectable ( Fig . 2B ) . In addition , cholesterol depletion with M  CD blocked the IL - induced protein expression of I  B  and A20 ( Fig . 2C ) and significantly reduced the IL - 1 - induced NF -  B - dependent luciferase reporter activity after 3 h of IL - 1 stimulation ( Fig . 2D ) . Furthermore , the detachment of IL - 1R cells inhibited the IL - 1 - induced NF -  B - dependent gene expression ( Fig . S2C ) . In sum , the disruption of lipid rafts significantly reduced the IL - 1 - induced NF -  B - dependent gene expression . 3 . 3 Disruption of lipid rafts influences the IL - 1 - induced NF -  B - dependent transcriptional induction downstream of nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF -  B The disruption of lipid rafts reduced the IL - 1 - induced NF -  B - dependent gene expression ( Figs . 1 , 2 and S2C ) . However , it remained elusive which step of the activation of NF -  B - dependent gene expression was affected . Thus , we investigated whether the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF -  B is influenced . We prepared nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from IL - 1 - stimulated IL - 1R cells and analyzed the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF -  B ( Fig . 3 ) . The protein levels of p65 in the nuclear fractions were significantly A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 13 increased after IL - 1 stimulation , whereas in the cytoplasmic fractions p65 levels decreased slightly in vehicle - treated IL - 1R1cells ( Fig . 3A ) . However , there was no significant difference detectable in Filipin - treated cells compared to vehicle - treated cells ( Fig . 3A , compare lanes 5 - 8 with lanes 1 - 4 ) . In accord with this finding , I  B  was almost completely degraded within 20 min of IL - 1 stimulation in vehicle - as well as Filipin - treated cells ( Fig . 3A , compare lane 3 with lane 7 ) . Interestingly , after 30 min of stimulation protein levels of I  B  started to increase again due to the IL - 1 - induced resynthesis of I  B  in vehicle - treated cells . In contrast , in Filipin - treated cells no resynthesis of I  B  was detectable demonstrating that the disruption of lipid rafts inhibited the IL - 1 - induced protein expression ( Fig . 3A , compare lane 4 with lane 8 ) . In order to assess the DNA binding of nuclear NF -  B we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA , Fig . 3B ) . NF -  B from nuclear extracts of IL - 1 - stimulated cells bound strongly to the NF -  B oligonucleotide probe after IL - 1 stimulation ( Fig . 3B ) . However , there was no significant difference between vehicle - and Filipin - treated cells ( Fig . 3B , compare lanes 6 - 8 with lanes 2 - 4 ) in accord with the unaffected nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit NF -  B ( Fig . 3A ) . Furthermore , we tested whether cholesterol depletion with M  CD affects the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF -  B ( Fig . S3 ) . In accord with the finding that treatment with M  CD delayed I  B degradation ( Fig . 1C ) the nuclear translocation of p65 was impaired ( Fig . S3A ) . Accordingly , the DNA binding of nuclear NF -  B was reduced by ~ 40 - 50 % after 10 to 30 min of IL - 1 stimulation ( Fig . S3B ) . Since treatment with Filipin did not cause a delay in NF -  B activation ( Fig . 3 ) , M  CD appears to have further cholesterol - dependent or - independent effects in addition to the disruption of lipid rafts as reported previously [ 39 ] . This conclusion is also supported by the finding that the disruption of lipid rafts induced by the A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 14 detachment of IL - 1R cells did not impair the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF -  B ( Fig . S4 ) . To test whether the disruption of lipid rafts affects the IL - 1 - induced protein expression at the level of transcriptional induction we performed real - time reverse transcription ( RT ) PCR to measure I  B  and A20 mRNA levels after IL - 1 stimulation in vehicle - and Filipin - treated cells . After 30 and 60 min of IL - 1 stimulation I  B  and A20 mRNAs were strongly induced ( Fig . 4A , C ) . Strikingly , Filipin reduced the I  B  and A20 mRNA induction significantly by ~ 40 - 60 % ( Fig . 4 ) . Thus , the disruption of lipid rafts inhibits the IL - 1 - induced NF -  B - dependent transcriptional induction , but does not affect the IL - 1 - induced nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF -  B . 3 . 4 Disruption of lipid rafts blocks the IL - induced internalization of IL - 1R1 The previous experiments clearly demonstrated that the disruption of lipid rafts reduced the IL - 1 - induced gene expression . However , it remained elusive whether the IL - 1 signaling from the plasma membrane or from signaling endosomes was affected or whether the internalization of IL - 1R1 was impaired . Since it is known that lipid - raft - dependent and clathrin - independent endocytosis is inhibited by the cholesterol - targeting compounds Filipin and M  CD [ 25 , 47 , 48 ] , we investigated whether these compounds affect the IL - 1 - dependent internalization of IL - 1R1 . IL - 1R cells were incubated with GST - tagged IL - 1  and the cells were either incubated at 37°C to allow receptor internalization or were kept on ice to block endocytosis . After the surface - bound GST - IL - 1  was removed with an acidic glycine buffer , the cells were lysed and a GST - pulldown was performed to precipitate internalized GST - IL1  as well as bound IL - 1R1 ( Fig . 5 ) . GST - IL - 1  and bound IL - 1R1 were internalized after 30 min of incubation at 37°C as shown by the higher protein levels in the GST - pulldown ( Fig . 5A , compare lane 2 with lane 3 ) . Strikingly , the IL - 1 - induced internalization of IL - 1R1 was strongly reduced by more than 75 % by the disruption of lipid rafts with Filipin ( Fig . 5A , A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 15 compare lane 3 with lane 4 , Fig . 5B ) . The clathrin - dependent uptake of transferrin was not affected by Filipin treatment at the applied concentration in a control experiment ( Fig . 5C ) demonstrating that Filipin specifically inhibited the raft - dependent endocytosis of IL - 1R1 . In accord with this result , the disruption of lipid rafts with M  CD ( Fig . 5D ) and by detachment of IL - 1R cells ( Fig . 5E ) also strongly reduced the internalization of IL - 1R1 . Thus , the IL - 1 - induced internalization of IL - 1R1 is a lipid - raft - dependent process . 3 . 5 Disruption of lipid rafts specifically blocks the IL - induced internalization of IL - 1R1 without affecting the constitutive internalization of IL - 1R1 The IL - 1R1 internalization assay described above measures the IL - 1 - induced internalization as well as the constitutive internalization of IL - 1R1 . However , for the IL - 4 - receptor - mediated signaling it was shown that the constitutive endocytosis of IL - 4 receptor subunits leads to an enrichment in cortical endosomes , which is a prerequisite for receptor subunit dimerization and signaling [ 49 , 50 ] . In order determine whether IL - 1 signaling is regulated in a similar fashion we used cell surface biotinylation to discriminate between constitutive and ligand - induced internalization of IL - 1R1 ( Fig . 6 ) . Cell surface proteins were biotinylated using Sulfo - NHS - SS - Biotin . Afterwards , IL - 1R cells were incubated at 37°C to allow receptor endocytosis . Then the biotin moieties were removed from labeled cell surface proteins by the reduction of the disulfide bond , whereas internalized proteins were protected from debiotinylation and were purified after cell lysis . Using this approach we were able to differentiate between the constitutive internalization of IL - 1R1 in the absence of IL - 1 and the induced internalization of IL - 1R1 in the presence of IL - 1 ( Fig . 6 ) . IL - 1R1 was efficiently biotinylated at the cell surface , which was not affected by Filipin ( Fig . 6 , compare lane 1 with lane 2 ) . When the cells were kept on ice to block internalization , biotin was also efficiently removed from cell surface proteins ( Fig . 6 , compare lane 1 with lane 3 ) . The debiotinylation was not affected by Filipin ( Fig . 6 , compare lanes 3 , 4 with lanes 1 , 2 ) . The constitutive internalization was measured by incubating the IL - 1R cells for 15 min at 37°C in the absence A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 16 of IL - 1 ( Fig . 6 , compare lane 5 with lane 3 ) . Interestingly , the disruption of lipid rafts with Filipin did not affect the constitutive internalization of IL - 1R1 ( Fig . 6 , compare lane 6 with lane 5 ) . Strikingly , IL - 1 strongly induced the internalization of IL - 1R1 ( Fig . 6 , compare lane 7 with lane 5 ) . Unlike the constitutive internalization , the IL - 1 - induced internalization of IL - 1R1 was inhibited by the disruption of lipid rafts with Filipin ( Fig . 6 , compare lane 8 with lane 7 ) to the level observed for the constitutive internalization . The IL - 1 - induced degradation of I  B  was not affected by Filipin ( Fig . 6 , second panel , compare lane 7 with lane 8 ) . Only a small fraction of the cell surface IL - 1R1 was internalized presumably because the IL - 1 - induced IL - 1R1 endocytosis depends on IL - 1R3 ( or IL - 1RAcP ) which is likely to be the limiting factor for IL - 1R1 internalization [ 8 , 15 ] . In sum , the disruption of lipid rafts specifically blocked the ligand - dependent internalization of IL - 1R1 and did not affect the constitutive internalization of IL - 1R1 . 4 Discussion The internalization of IL - 1R1 is of critical importance for the IL - 1 - induced protein expression and modulates the IL - 1 - dependent transcriptional induction [ 17 , 18 ] . We proposed a two - tiered model of IL - 1 signaling in which distinct signaling events are triggered at the plasma membrane whereas others are initiated after the endocytosis of IL - 1R1 possibly from signaling endosomes . The endosomal signaling events remained largely elusive but seem to involve the activation of the small GTPase Rac1 [ 18 ] . Here we report that lipid rafts are important for the IL - 1 - induced internalization of IL - 1R1 and the IL - 1 - induced gene expression . In order to determine the role of lipid rafts in IL - 1 signaling we used three different approaches to disrupt lipid rafts : Cholesterol - sequestration by Filipin III from Streptomyces filipinensis [ 25 , 38 , 47 ] , cholesterol extraction using M  CD [ 25 , 39 , 48 ] and internalization of lipid raft components triggered by the detachment of IL - 1R cells [ 40 , 41 ] . The disruption of lipid rafts with these methods inhibited the IL - 1 - induced A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 17 endocytosis of IL - 1R1 ( Figs . 5 and 6 ) , whereas the constitutive internalization was not affected ( Fig . 6 ) . Moreover , the IL - 1 - induced protein expression was blocked by the disruption of lipid rafts ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . Strikingly , early signaling events up to 30 min of IL - 1 stimulation such as I  B  phosphorylation and degradation , phosphorylation of p38  MAPK and JNK1 / 2 were not affected by Filipin and the detachment of IL - 1R cells ( Figs . 1A , B , D , 3A , S1 and S4 ) , whereas M  CD delayed I  B  phosphorylation and degradation ( Figs . 1C and S3 ) . However , since M  CD removes cholesterol from raft - and non - raft fractions and may also extract phosholipids [ 39 ] , the delay of the IL - 1 - stimulated I  B  phosphorylation and degradation was presumably caused by a raft - independent side effect . The disruption of lipid rafts with Filipin and by detachment of IL - 1R cells significantly reduced the IL - 1 - induced NF -  B - dependent luciferase expression ( Figs . 2B and S2C ) without affecting the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF -  B ( Figs . 3 and S4 ) . The treatment with M  CD inhibited the IL - 1 - induced NF -  B - dependent luciferase expression ( Fig . 2D ) and delayed the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF -  B in accord with the delayed I  B  degradation ( Fig . S3 ) . Since neither Filipin nor the detachment of IL - 1R cells delayed nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF -  B ( Figs . 3 and S3 ) , this effect of M  CD was presumably not caused by the disruption of lipid rafts . However , Filipin blocked the IL - 1 - induced mRNA expression ( Fig . 4 ) , although it did not affect the IL - 1 - induced nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF -  B . Therefore , the disruption of lipid rafts inhibited the IL - 1 - induced mRNA and protein expression at the level of the NF -  B - dependent transcriptional induction . The detachment of adherent cells is expected to cause a range of biological responses . For example , it was reported that detachment triggers a poorly defined general inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis [ 51 , 52 ] . Thus , the inhibition of IL - 1 - induced protein expression in suspended cells may be independent of the disruption of lipid rafts ( Fig . 1D ) . Nevertheless , A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 18 the experiments with suspended cells provide two important insights into the role of lipid rafts in IL - 1 signaling : Firstly , the detachment of IL - 1R cells blocked the IL - 1 - induced internalization of IL - 1R1 ( Fig . 5E ) . This result strongly supports the conclusion that the inhibition of IL - 1R1 endocytosis observed after treatment with Filipin ( Fig . 5A ) and M  CD ( Fig . 5D ) is specifically caused by the disruption of lipid rafts . Secondly , early IL - 1 signaling events up to 30 min of IL - 1 stimulation were not affected by the detachment of IL - 1R cells since I  B  phosphorylation and degradation as well as NF -  B nuclear translocation and DNA binding were not significantly altered ( Figs . 1D and S4 ) . These results corroborate the notion that the disruption of lipid rafts does not affect early IL - 1 signaling up to 30 min of IL - 1 stimulation from the plasma membrane . Altogether , the effects of the disruption of lipid rafts on IL - 1 signaling are reminiscent of the consequences of the inhibition of IL - 1R1 endocytosis [ 17 , 18 ] . We established previously that the inhibition of IL - 1R1 endocytosis blocks the IL - 1 - induced protein expression at the level of transcriptional induction [ 17 , 18 ] . Similarly , the disruption of lipid rafts inhibited the IL - 1 - induced protein expression by blocking the IL - 1 - induced mRNA synthesis ( Figs . 1 , 2 and 4 ) . We demonstrated previously that early signaling events like I  B  phosphorylation and degradation and the phosphorylation of MAPKs JNK1 / 2 and p38  , nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF -  B are not affected by inhibitors of endocytosis or dynamin depletion up to 30 min of IL - 1 stimulation [ 17 , 18 ] . Correspondingly , the disruption of lipid rafts did not affect the early IL - 1 - induced signaling ( Figs . 1 , 3 , S1 and S4 ) . We showed earlier that blocking IL - 1R internalization reduces the IL - 1 - induced NF -  B - dependent gene expression [ 17 ] . Accordingly , the IL - 1 - induced NF -  B - dependent gene expression was significantly decreased by the disruption of lipid rafts ( Fig . 2 ) . Therefore , the effects of the disruption of lipid rafts on IL - 1 signaling presented here can be mainly if not completely explained by the inhibition of IL - 1R1 internalization ( Figs . 5 and 6 ) . A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 19 Lipid rafts have been implicated in IL - 1 signaling previously [ 53 ] . However , a model was proposed in which IL - 1 - dependent signaling events are initiated only after lipid - raft - dependent endocytosis of the IL - 1R1 from an endosomal compartment . In contrast to this model , we demonstrated previously that IL - 1 signaling is a two - tiered process involving signal transduction from the plasma membrane as well as from endosomes [ 17 , 18 ] . The results presented here support the two - tiered model of IL - 1 signaling ( Fig . 7 ) . IL - 1 induces early IL - 1 signaling events at the plasma membrane that are independent of lipid rafts . Subsequently , IL - 1R1 translocates from a non - raft domain of the plasma membrane to lipid rafts to be internalized . Such an IL - 1 - induced translocation of IL - 1R1 into lipid rafts fractions in a sucrose gradient has been detected in astrocytes previously [ 54 ] . After the internalization , IL - 1 - dependent signaling events presumably from signaling endosomes are triggered that are essential for the IL - 1 - induced NF -  B - dependent gene expression . The mechanistic details of the raft - dependent internalization of IL - 1R1 remain elusive . Caveolin - 1 has been implicated in IL - 1 - induced NF -  B activation in mouse fibroblasts [ 53 ] and the activation of p38  MAPK and MK2 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) [ 55 ] . Nevertheless , the siRNA - mediated depletion of Caveolin - 1 in IL - 1R cells did not affect IL - 1R1 internalization ( Fig . S5A ) , the phosphorylation and degradation of I  B  as well as the phosphorylation and activation of p38  MAPK and JNK1 / 2 ( Fig . S5B ) . However , it has been reported that HEK 293 cells express very low levels of Caveolin - 1 and lack cell - surface caveolae [ 56 ] . Thus , these discrepancies regarding the involvement of Caveolin - 1 and caveolae in IL - 1 signaling could be explained by cell - type - specific differences between IL - 1R cells and other cell types . Lipid rafts are important organizing centers for signal transduction as well as receptor endocytosis . GPCRs are frequently associated with lipid rafts and are internalized by clathrin - independent , raft - dependent endocytosis [ 27 ] . The internalized GPCRs trigger G - protein - A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 20 dependent and - independent signal transduction pathways from endosomal membranes [ 57 ] . Signal transduction mediated by B - and T - cell receptors and TLRs requires the raft - dependent assembly signaling complexes at the plasma membrane [ 26 , 28 - 30 ] . Nevertheless , TLR4 internalization was suggested to be clathrin - dependent based on results obtained with allegedly specific inhibitors of clathrin - dependent endocytosis , MDC and Pitstop 2 . [ 58 - 60 ] . However , both inhibitors also impair clathrin - independent endocytosis [ 25 , 34 - 36 ] . Since TLR4 translocates to raft domains of the plasma membrane after LPS stimulation to associate with the lipid raft protein CD14 [ 30 ] and the internalization of TLR4 depends on CD14 [ 61 ] , the raft - dependent endocytosis of TLR4 remains a possible scenario . Thus , lipid rafts are frequently involved in signal transduction triggered from the plasma membrane . In contrast , we demonstrated that the IL - 1 - induced early signal transduction at the plasma membrane was not affected by the disruption of lipid rafts . However , lipid rafts also regulate receptor endocytosis to trigger endosomal signaling as shown for some GPCRs [ 27 ] . Similarly , the raft - dependent endocytosis of IL - 1R1 is required to initiate the internalization - dependent IL - 1 signaling . Interestingly , recent data suggested that the contribution of clathrin - independent internalization to the endocytic flux is lower than 5 % [ 62 ] . Notably , the clathrin - independent FEME pathway dependent on endophilin was recently described that is critical for the ligand - induced endocytosis of a variety of G - protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) and receptor tyrosine kinases [ 25 ] . Thus , clathrin - independent endocytosis may be specifically engaged in ligand - induced endocytosis and not constitutive endocytosis . The IL - 1 - induced internalization of IL - 1R1 would be in accord with such a hypothesis . The IL - 2 receptor ( IL - 2R , consisting of IL - 2  , IL - 2  and IL - 2  ) was shown to be internalized by the FEME pathway in a ligand - and endophilin - dependent manner [ 25 ] . However , preliminary experiments with a dominant negative mutant of endophilin A2 suggest that endophilins do not play a role in IL - 1R1 internalization and the IL - 1 - induced protein expression ( data not shown ) . The constitutive A CC EP T E D M A NU S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 21 internalization of IL - 4 / IL - 13 receptor subunits ( IL - 4R  , IL - 2R  and IL - 13R  1 ) was reported to occur in the absence of a ligand and their enrichment in cortical endosomes was critical for the ligand - induced heterodimer formation triggering signal transduction [ 49 , 50 ] . Such a regulation was excluded for IL - 1 signaling because Filipin did not affect the constitutive internalization of IL - 1R1 but specifically blocked the IL - 1 - induced internalization ( Fig . 6 ) . Thus , we conclude the IL - 1R1 internalization is a ligand - , lipid - raft - and dynamin - dependent process . The signaling events after the internalization of IL - 1R1 are still obscure . Interestingly , endocytic proteins have been reported to fulfil additional functions , e . g . in transcriptional regulation [ 63 ] . Thus , such a mechanism would directly link receptor endocytosis and transcriptional induction . NF -  B influences not only transcription initiation , but also chromatin remodeling , transcription elongation and mRNA processing [ 64 ] . The nuclear activities of NF - kB are extensively regulated by posttranslational modification such as phosphorylation and acetylation [ 65 , 66 ] . It is conceivable that some of these modifications are regulated by signaling events initiated on signaling endosomes after the internalization of IL - 1R1 . However , the mechanistic details as to how IL - 1R1 internalization regulates the IL - 1 - induced gene expression need to be addressed in future studies . 5 Conclusions The disruption of lipid rafts inhibits the ligand - induced internalization of IL - 1R1 and thereby blocks the IL - 1 - induced gene expression at the level of transcriptional induction . Thus , a two - tiered model of IL - 1 signaling depends on signaling events at the plasma membrane as well as endosomal signaling after internalization of IL - 1R1 to enable the IL - 1 - induced protein expression .

The results are representative of two independent experiments . Fig . 7 . The lipid - raft - dependent internalization of IL - 1R1 is critical for the two - tier system of IL - 1 - mediated signal transduction . IL - 1 binds to the receptor to trigger signal transduction events leading to the activation of the TAK1 and the IKK complexes . The IKK complex phosphorylates I  B  to induce its degradation enabling NF -  B to enter the nucleus and to bind to cognate promoter sequences . TAK1 also phosphorylates MAPK kinases ( MKKs ) which activate the MAPKs p38  and JNK1 / 2 . These events are triggered from the cell surface and involve neither lipid rafts nor receptor internalization . However , lipid rafts are critical for IL1 receptor internalization and the transcriptional induction mediated by DNA - bound NF -  B . Thus , IL - 1R1 translocates to a lipid raft domain of the plasma membrane to be internalized . After the internalization IL - 1R1 signaling events are initiated presumably from signaling endosomes that are essential for the IL - 1 - induced NF -  B - dependent gene expression . NF -  B induces not only the gene expression of proinflammatory factors , but also the expression of feedback inhibitors that limit and eventually terminate IL - 1 - induced signaling .
