Cell fate during development is deﬁned by transcription factors that act as molecular switches to activate or repress speciﬁc gene expression programmes . The POU transcription factor Oct - 3 / 4 ( encoded by Pou5f1 ) is a candidate regulator in pluripo - tent and germline cells 1 – 4 and is essential for the initial forma - tion of a pluripotent founder cell population in the mammalian embryo 5 . Here we use conditional expression and repression in embryonic stem ( ES ) cells to determine requirements for Oct - 3 / 4 in the maintenance of developmental potency . Although transcriptional determination has usually been con - sidered as a binary on - off control system , we found that the precise level of Oct - 3 / 4 governs three distinct fates of ES cells . A less than twofold increase in expression causes differentiation into primitive endoderm and mesoderm . In contrast , repression of Oct - 3 / 4 induces loss of pluripotency and dedifferentiation to trophectoderm . Thus a critical amount of Oct - 3 / 4 is required to sustain stem - cell self - renewal , and up - or downregulation induce divergent developmental programmes . Our ﬁndings establish a role for Oct - 3 / 4 as a master regulator of pluripo - tency that controls lineage commitment and illustrate the sophistication of critical transcriptional regulators and the con - sequent importance of quantitative analyses . Fig . 1 Generation of ES cells with variable Oct - 3 / 4 expression . a , Strategy for generat - ing ZHTc6 and ZHBTc4 ES cells . ZHTc6 ES cells have one allele of Pou5f1 inactivated by targeted integration of an IRESzeopA cassette and contain a Tc - regulated Oct - 3 / 4 transgene . This transgene is activated in the absence of Tc . b , Southern - blot hybridization of ZHTc6 and ZHBTc4 ES cells . Loss of the wild - type allele in ZHBTc4 cells was identiﬁed with both 5´ and 3´ ﬂanking probes . Hybridization with probe C , a cDNA fragment encoding the DNA - binding domain of Oct - 3 / 4 , conﬁrms the absence of endogeneous Pou5f1 from ZHBTc4 cells , and detects the transgene and a pseudo - gene in ZHTc6 and ZHBTc4 cells . c , North - ern - blot analysis of Pou5f1 expression in ZHTc6 and ZHBTc4 cells . Total RNA pre - pared from parental CGR8 ES cells , ZHTc6 cells in the presence of Tc and ZHBTc4 cells in the absence of Tc were hybridized with probe C . ZHBTc4 cells lack the wild - type transcript and express two transgene - derived transcripts . The larger of these cor - responds to the full - length Oct - 3 / 4 - IRES β geo mRNA . The smaller transcript is slightly larger than the endogeneous tran - scripts detected in CGR8 and ZHTc6 cells . This is identiﬁed as a truncated product of the Oct - 3 / 4 - IRES β geopA transgene by spe - ciﬁc hybridization to a β - globin cDNA frag - ment ( data not shown ) and because Tc regulates its expression . This transcript ter - minates at the poly ( A ) addition signal in the 3´ UTR of Pou5f1 cDNA and therefore generates functional Oct - 3 / 4 protein . d , Regulation of the Oct - 3 / 4 transgene in ZHBTc6 and ZHBTc4 cells . Northern - blot hybridization with probe C plus an IRES probe , which detects transcripts from the two targeted alleles and serves as a load - ing control .

Two clones with no transgene expression in the presence of Tc gave induced expression comparable to that of the endogeneous allele . Both clones , ZHTc6 and ZHTc25 , underwent extensive differentiation after Oct - 3 / 4 induction . Transgene expression was fully induced 48 hours after withdrawal of Tc ( Fig . 1 d ) and differentiation was evident by 72 hours . Tc induced differentiation in a concentra - tion - dependent manner ( Fig . 2 b ) . Quantitative immunoblot analysis of two independent experiments showed that maximum induction doubled the amount of Oct - 3 / 4 protein such that it exceeded the level in non - induced cells ( Fig . 1 e ) . This represents at most a 50 % increase above the amount of Oct - 3 / 4 present in biallelic ES cells , yet is sufﬁcient to induce the differentiation of most cells in both clonal and mass cultures . To provide independent conﬁrmation that elevated Oct - 3 / 4 induces differentiation , we exploited episomal supertransfection to generate primary transfectants at high frequency 8 , 9 . Vectors containing no insert or irrelevant inserts produced predomi - nantly undifferentiated stem - cell colonies . In contrast , Oct - 3 / 4 expression vectors generated many differentiated colonies ( Fig . 2 c ) . Supertransfection of expression vectors encoding Oct - 1 , Oct - 2 or Oct - 6 had no effect on the frequency of differentiated colonies generated . Thus the induction of differentiation by Oct - 3 / 4 is not a general property of POU transcriptional regulators . We next determined the consequences of reducing the expres - sion of Oct - 3 / 4 . We introduced a second Pou5f1 targeting con - struct into ZHTc6 cells ( Fig . 1 a ) . To rescue prospective doubly targeted ES cells while avoiding an increase in Oct - 3 / 4 protein beyond the threshold for induction of differentiation , we induced transgene expression by withdrawal of Tc just 24 hours before transfection . Of 17 blasticidin - S – resistant clones , 2 had undergone the desired deletion ( Fig . 1 b ) . Both clones behaved similarly in preliminary analyses , therefore data is presented for only one , ZHBTc4 . The ZHBTc4 cells were indistinguishable from parental ES cells when Oct3 / 4 transgene expression was maintained . Addi - tion of Tc resulted in repression of the transgene such that tran - scripts and protein were undetectable by 24 hours ( Fig . 1 d , f ) . Profound morphological changes then occur in ZHBTc4 cells . The cells compacted over the initial 48 hours and subsequently ﬂattened out over the culture surface , often acquiring enlarged nuclei ( Fig . 3 ) . This was evident at 1 ng / ml Tc , at which Oct - 3 / 4 protein was reduced but not eliminated ( Fig . 1 f ) . The response was comparable in the absence or presence of leukaemia inhibitory factor ( LIF ) . Therefore , Oct - 3 / 4 function is an absolute requirement for maintenance of ES cell identity and for the self - renewal activity of LIF ( ref . 10 ) . If LIF was withdrawn in the absence of Tc , however , ZHBTc4 cells differentiated as nor - mal despite continued expression of the transgene ( Fig . 2 a ) . Oct - 3 / 4 expression alone is therefore not sufﬁcient to maintain the undifferentiated phenotype , but requires a cooperative signal provided by LIF stimulation . We next investigated transcriptional responses of ﬁve target genes 11 to altered levels of Oct - 3 / 4 ( Fig . 4 a ) . All were downregu - lated in Tc - treated ZHBTc4 cells with kinetics parallel to the dis - appearance of Pou5f1 transcripts . Otx1 , and to a lesser extent Ebaf , were correspondingly upregulated on induction of the Oct - 3 / 4 transgene in ZHTc6 cells .

Thus , increased Oct - 3 / 4 has divergent effects on different target genes . We then examined expression of marker genes to evaluate the nature of the induced differentiation programmes ( Fig . 4 b ) . Gata4 mRNA , which is restricted to parietal and visceral endo - derm in early embryos 12 , was detectable in undifferentiated ES cells but increased during differentiation induced by elevation of Oct - 3 / 4 or withdrawal of LIF . The mesoderm marker brachyury ( T ; ref . 13 ) was also activated under these conditions . Therefore , upregulation of Oct - 3 / 4 induces commitment to extra - embryo - nic endoderm and mesoderm lineages , similar to withdrawal of LIF ( ref . 14 ) . The differentiation events may not be wholly identi - cal , however , because Fgf - 5 , a marker of primitive ectoderm 15 , appears to be more abundant after withdrawal of LIF . Transcripts encoding Gata4 , brachyury and Fgf - 5 were barely detectable following suppression of Oct - 3 / 4 . In contrast , mRNAs encoding two transcription factors implicated in trophoblast differ - entiation , Hand1 ( ref . 16 ) and Cdx2 ( ref . 17 ) , were rapidly induced . Hand1 also appeared in differentiated ZHTc6 cells , but consider - ably later , likely reﬂecting its expression in mesodermal and neural crest derivatives . Cdx2 , a speciﬁc marker of diploid trophectoderm in the early conceptus , was only detected during ZHBTc4 differen - tiation . Mouse ES cells are derived from the epiblast 18 , however , and accordingly do not normally differentiate into the trophectodermal lineage in vitro or in vivo 19 . To conﬁrm that lack of Oct - 3 / 4 induces commitment to trophectoderm , we attempted to establish tro - phoblast stem ( TS ) cell cultures 20 from ZHBTc4 cells . Oct - 3 / 4 was repressed in conditions permissive for TS cell propagation ( FGF - 4 plus feeders ) . Over three to ﬁve days the ES cells changed morphol - ogy and formed monolayer colonies of regular epithelial cells ( Fig . 5 a ) . These cells continued to proliferate and could be serially pas - saged for at least one month . Cultures consisted of undifferentiated epithelioid cells and some overtly trophoblastic cells . On with - drawal of FGF - 4 , the cultures differentiated completely into large , spread cells , many of which had the swollen nuclei characteristic of endoreduplicating trophoblast giant cells ( Fig . 5 b ) . RT – PCR analy - sis conﬁrmed expression of markers 20 of proliferating trophoblast ( Cdx2 , Esrrb , Mash2 and Tpbp ) and mature trophoblast ( Pl1 ; Fig . 5 c ) . Finally , in situ hybridization localized Cdx2 transcripts in the proliferating epithelial population , substantiating their identiﬁ - cation as TS cells ( Fig . 5 d ) . These ﬁndings establish that removal of Oct - 3 / 4 results in a respeciﬁcation of ES cell fate . We conclude that a component of Oct - 3 / 4 function is as a gatekeeper that prevents dedifferentia - tion into the trophectoderm lineage and thereby ‘locks’ pluripo - tent capacity . The role of Oct - 3 / 4 , however , is more sophisticated than that of a simple repressor of trophectodermal differentiation . Oct - 3 / 4 also activates transcription of speciﬁc genes through cooperation with a series of partners including Sry - related Sox - 2 ( refs 21 , 22 ) , a stem - cell – restricted E1A - like activity 23 and the transcription factor Rox - 1 ( ref . 24 ) . The amount of Oct - 3 / 4 relative to these different partners appears to be crucial 23 . The downregulation of Zfp42 mRNA caused by induction of elevated Oct - 3 / 4 ( Fig . 4 a ) is consistent with the ﬁnding in transient assays that overexpression of Oct - 3 / 4 represses activation of the Zfp42 promoter mediated via Rox - 1 ( ref . 24 ) . Elevated Oct - 3 / 4 may also enhance expres - sion of targets , for example through formation of homodimers as shown for the osteopontin gene 25 .

We believe that LIF does not support ES - cell renewal by maintaining Oct - 3 / 4 expression . ZHBTc4 cells underwent dif - ferentiation in the absence of LIF in a manner indistinguishable from that of parental ES cells ( Fig . 2 a ) , even though the level of Oct - 3 / 4 expression was maintained from the hCMV * - 1 trans - gene for at least 72 hours ( see Fig . 7 , http : / / genetics . nature . com / supplementary _ info ) . We hypothesize that activation of Stat3 by LIF ( refs 9 , 26 ) , or an alternative self - renewal signal 27 , is necessary to stimulate expression of a speciﬁc Oct - 3 / 4 partner such as Rox - 1 . This model explains how withdrawal of LIF or increased Oct - 3 / 4 have identical consequences for particular tar - get genes and thus trigger similar differentiation events ( Fig . 6 a ) . Maintaining Oct - 3 / 4 expression within a certain range appears to be critical for stem - cell renewal , with any increase or decrease triggering differentiation to endoderm / mesoderm or trophecto - derm , respectively ( Fig . 6 b ) . The threshold for inducing differen - tiation is apparently set at 50 % above or below the normal diploid expression level in undifferentiated stem cells . The amount of Oct - 3 / 4 must therefore be tightly regulated to main - tain stem - cell phenotype . Consistent with this , heterozygous ES cells show only a 30 – 40 % reduction in Pou5f1 transcripts ( Fig . 1 c ) and Oct - 3 / 4 protein ( data not shown ) . Morphogen gradients are thought to direct many inductive and patterning events during embryogenesis , but mechanisms for interpreting gradients at the cellular level are unclear . Our data indicate that the amount of a transcriptional regulator in a cell can output at least three different responses with precise threshold levels . Therefore , graded activation of signal transduc - tion pathways or nuclear receptors translated into quantitative differences in levels of a master transcriptional regulator may be sufﬁcient to deﬁne a series of distinct cellular responses . In vivo , Oct - 3 / 4 protein is abundant in the inner cell mass of early blastocysts and downregulated in trophectoderm , whereas nascent primitive endoderm in late blastocysts expresses Oct - 3 / 4 at an even higher level ( ref . 28 ) . This profile accords with loss of Oct - 3 / 4 , permitting trophectoderm development and upregulation driving primitive endoderm differentiation . Quantitative modulation of finely balanced interactions between Oct - 3 / 4 and different partners may be a reiterated mechanism that governs successive determination events , per - haps including germ - cell specification , during the pluripotent phase of mammalian embryogenesis . Fig . 6 Functions of Oct - 3 / 4 in pluripo - tent stem cells . a , Model for Oct - 3 / 4 and Stat3 cooperative function . Self - renewal requires transcriptional func - tions of both Oct - 3 / 4 and LIF - stimulated Stat3 . Oct - 3 / 4 directly or indirectly represses trophectodermal determination genes such as Cdx2 and Hand1 and thereby blocks differentia - tion to trophectoderm . Oct - 3 / 4 also activates target genes in stem cells through interaction with a set of co - activators . We hypothesize that a sub - set of such partners , including Rox - 1 , are regulated by Stat3 . Sequestration of such co - activators by excess Oct - 3 / 4 or their downregulation following LIF withdrawal would thus result in a similar loss of expression of targets such as Zfp42 . b , Relationship between Oct - 3 / 4 expression level and stem - cell fate . To main - tain the undifferentiated stem - cell phenotype , Oct - 3 / 4 expression must remain within plus or minus 50 % of normal diploid expression . If Oct - 3 / 4 expression is increased beyond the upper threshold level , differentiation is triggered into primitive endoderm or mesoderm . If Oct - 3 / 4 expression is decreased , stem cells are redirected into the trophectoderm lineage .
