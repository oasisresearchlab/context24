Figure 1 shows the application of the IHRSR method to both the undecorated yeast F - actin and muscle F - actin segments that have been found . The Summary average “twist” of both muscle and yeast F - actin in the absence of other proteins is (cid:1) 166 (cid:1) per subunit . The Actin is one of the most highly conserved eukaryotic twist of the tilted muscle F - actin converges to (cid:1) 161 (cid:1) proteins . There are no amino acid changes between per subunit in these naked patches , similar to the twist the chicken and human skeletal muscle isoforms , and imposed by cofilin on extensively decorated filaments the most dissimilar actins still share more than 85 % [ 10 , 15 ] . In contrast , in the yeast filaments , the twist sequence identity [ 1 ] . We suggest that large discrete converges to (cid:1) 153 (cid:1) per subunit , resulting in a distance internal modes of freedom within the actin filament between “crossovers” of the two long - pitch helical [ 2 ] may account for a significant component of this strands of (cid:1) 190 A˚ ( Figure 2G ) , as opposed to crossover conservation , since each subunit must make multiple distances with a mean of (cid:1) 350 A˚ in pure yeast F - actin specific interactions with neighboring subunits . In ( with a mean twist of (cid:1) 166 (cid:1) ) ( Figure 2F ) . Despite the support of this , we find that the same state of tilt of differences in twist , both the yeast and muscle recon - the actin subunit exists in both yeast and vertebrate structions appear to be very similar to each other and striatedmuscle actin , and thatin boththe twodomains very different from normal F - actin reconstructions ( Fig - undergo a “propeller rotation . ” A similar movement of ure2A ) .

Remarkably , metry . we find that in the tilted state actin subunits make new Earlier work had suggested that the subunits within contacts with neighboring subunits that also involve these regions were tilted by (cid:1) 10 (cid:1) – 12 (cid:1) from their normal these inserts , suggesting a key role for these elements position in F - actin [ 10 ] . Significant improvements in the in F - actin polymorphism . reconstruction of muscle actin in this unusual state , as well as an entirely independent reconstruction of yeast Results and Discussion F - actin in this conformation , have allowed us to see that , not only is the subunit tilted by (cid:1) 20 (cid:1) , but the two major In the presence of either human or plant actin depoly - domains must undergo the same type of “propeller rota - merizing factor ( ADF ) , short segments of skeletal muscle tion” ( Figure 3C ) in both muscle and yeast filaments to actin filaments were found in which ADF was not regu - fitexistingcrystalstructuresofG - actin [ 16 , 17 ] intothese larly bound and in which the actin subunits had a tilt of reconstructions ( see Movie 1 in the Supplementary Ma - (cid:1) 10 (cid:1) – 12 (cid:1) from their position in normal F - actin [ 10 ] .

This is consistent with reports show - traditional means [ 12 ] would obscure this transition that ing that the axial rise per subunit in F - actin is quite may only involve relatively short segments ( (cid:1) 10 sub - invariant , with changes of less than 0 . 08 A ˚ per subunit units ) .

The IHRSR Method for Image Analysis The IHRSR method [ 11 ] for image analysis of helicalfilamentsisquitepowerfulforseparat - ing out discrete states of twist and structure within F - actin . Shown are two starting refer - encevolumes ( aandb ) , whicharelow - resolu - tion versions of the Holmes model for F - actin [ 28 ] , and resulting reconstructions for ( c ) yeastactinand ( d ) muscleactin . The ( a ) refer - ence volume has been generated with a sym - metry of 152 (cid:1) per subunit , while the ( b ) refer - ence volume has a symmetry of 166 (cid:1) per subunit . This difference in twist leads to a large difference in the distance between crossoversoftheright - handedlong - pitchhe - lical strands in F - actin , indicated by the arrows ( aandb ) . The503segmentsofmuscle actin , selected as being undecorated within filaments extensively decorated with hADF , were reconstructed with IHRSR , starting with the references having symmetries of either 166 (cid:1) or154 (cid:1) . Theopensquaresshowthecon - vergenceofthesymmetrytothevalueof161 (cid:1) , and both paths resulted in the reconstruction shownin ( d ) , eventhoughthestartingmodels have very different symmetries and conformations from the result found . For the yeast actin , a similar procedure is shown ( open circles ) , in which 1 , 240 segments have started IHRSR using the initial models with symmetries of 152 (cid:1) and 162 (cid:1) but converge to a symmetry of 153 (cid:1) after 60 cycles , with the resulting reconstruction shown in ( c ) . of subdomains 2 and 4 of (cid:1) 10 (cid:1) and (cid:1) 5 (cid:1) , respectively , of the molecule in the closed state [ 17 ] . Most signifi - cantly , an (cid:1) 30 (cid:1) rotation of one of the major domains when compared with structures for ATP - (cid:3) - actin [ 21 ] . Yeast hexokinase has a 12 (cid:1) rotation of the two major was required [ 8 ] to superimpose the nucleotide - bound structuresofactin [ 23 ] orHsc70 [ 24 ] ontothenucleotide - domains between the apo - and glucose - bound forms [ 3 ] . Crystal structures for different states of DnaK and free hexokinase structure [ 25 ] . Perhaps the most impor - tant comparison is with the structures that have recently Hsc70 do not exist , but solution small - angle X - ray scat - tering experiments have shown that there is a change been determined for actin - related protein 2 ( Arp2 ) and Arp3 [ 6 ] . In Arp3 , the central cleft is opened about 12 (cid:1) in the radius of gyration of 1 – 2 A˚ for DnaK [ 22 ] and of 4 – 5 A˚ for Hsc70 [ 5 ] induced by binding ATP . The radius with respect to actin . In Arp2 , however , not only is the central cleft open about 18 (cid:1) with respect to actin , but of gyration that we calculate for (cid:2) - actin in the propeller - rotated state is only 0 . 6 A˚ greater than the radius of there is a propeller rotation of the major domains that is very similar to what we observe in the tilted state .

The ( D ) atomic model provides a verygood matchwith boththe ( C ) tilted yeast actinandthe ( E ) tiltedmuscleactin . However , the twist of the tilted yeast and muscle actin is different , which can account for most of the differences between ( C ) and ( E ) . For the ( C ) yeastactin , the twistis (cid:1) 153 (cid:1) per subunit , while for the ( E ) muscle actin , the twist is (cid:1) 161 (cid:1) per subunit . The reduction of the angle between subunits to (cid:1) 153 (cid:1) results in very short crossovers in these regions . ( F and G ) In ( G ) , a two - dimensional average of 144 segments from the set used for three - dimensional reconstruction ( C ) shows a crossover distance ( red arrows ) of (cid:1) 190 A˚ . For comparison , the average crossover distance in normal yeast F - actin ( A ) is (cid:1) 350 A˚ , and that can be seen in the average of 110 segments in ( F ) . Current Biology 572 Figure 3 .

These reconstructions can be fit very well with atomic models . The molecular models used are : ( A ) unmodified X - ray crystal structure of (cid:2) - actin with an open cleft [ 16 ] , ( B ) a 12 (cid:1) propeller - rotated model of closed (cid:2) - actin [ 17 ] , and ( C ) a 30 (cid:1) propeller - rotated model of open (cid:2) - actin [ 16 ] . ( D ) In this panel , the change in the actin subunit in ( B ) is shown . ( E ) In this panel , the change in the actin subunit in ( C ) is shown . The crystal structures of the closed state of (cid:2) - actin [ 17 ] ( [ D ] , yellow ) and the open state of this molecule [ 16 ] ( [ E ] , yellow ) have been modified by a 12 (cid:1) relative rotation of the two major domains ( [ D ] , green ) or a 30 (cid:1) relative rotation of these domains ( [ E ] , blue ) to fit the reconstructions in ( B ) and ( C ) , respectively . resemble nucleotide - bound actin and initiate nucleation make a contact with subdomain 3 ( Figure 2B ) . This is surprising , since a covalent crosslink has been estab - of an actin filament [ 6 ] . An abundance of evidence sug - gests that large domain motions are a general property lished between subdomain 2 and subdomain 1 . Atomic modeling , however , shows that relativelysmall deforma - of this class of proteins . To further probe the molecular details of this unusual tions of both the DNase I binding loop and the C termi - nus , two regions known to be flexible in actin [ 21 , 23 , state of F - actin , we have used the Q41C yeast actin mutant , which allows a disulfide to be formed between 27 ] , can allow the disulfide to exist in this different state ( Figure 3B ) . In addition , the nucleotide binding cleft in subdomain 2 ( residue 41 ) of one actin subunit and sub - domain 1 ( residue 374 ) of an actin subunit above it on the disulfide - bonded filaments is now closed ( Figure 3B ) , which provides an additional means for the subunit the same long - pitch helical strand [ 13 , 26 ] . Under condi - tions of extensive crosslinking ( (cid:1) 93 % of all subunits to accommodate the strain imposed . Only finding this partially rotated state in the disulfide crosslinked fila - are linked by a disulfide to an adjacent subunit ) , no segments of tilted actin were found after filaments were ments provides a very nice confirmation of the models proposed ( Figure 3 ) , since such a disulfide would be extensively decorated with yeast cofilin . However , (cid:1) 1 , 000 segments were found ( Figure 2B ) that yielded a incompatible with the fully tilted state due to the large distance that now occurs between subdomain 2 and verystablereconstructionofapartiallypropeller - rotated state . We have been able to eliminate the possibility subdomain 1 above it . The tilted state of actin clearly requires entirely new that this state is actually a mixture of segments that are tilted and rotated and segments that are untilted and contacts to be made between subunits in the filament . An interesting question is how such contacts can switch unrotated by showing that segments cannot be sorted intotwosuchclassesusingtiltedanduntiltedreferences in the filament without the filament breaking . One expla - nation may have to do with the fact that actin contains ( data not shown ) . In normal F - actin , subdomain 2 makes a strong contact with subdomain 1 ( Figure 2A ) , but in two “strands” of subunits , and a switching of contacts of one subunit would not break the filament as long the tilted state of actin , subdomain 2 makes a strong contact with subdomain 3 ( Figure 2C ) . In the crosslinked as contacts are still made to this subunit by adjacent subunits on the opposite strand . Thus , it is possible that partially rotated state , subdomain 2 also appears to Brief Communication 573 Figure 4 . Sequence Inserts in Actin Not Present in Bacterial MreB ( A ) The six sequence inserts that are present in all actins but absent in bacterial MreB [ 9 ] are shown in the G - actin structure . The color code is : yellow , residues 40 – 48 ( DNase I binding loop , subdomain 2 ) ; cyan , residues 197 – 203 ( subdomain 4 ) ; blue , residues 228 – 235 ( subdomain 4 ) ; magenta , residues 262 – 274 ( subdomains 3 – 4 ) ; orange , residues 319 – 327 ( subdomain 3 ) ; and purple , residues 354 – 375 ( subdomain 1 ) . ( B ) The interactions between four of these inserts are shown in normal F - actin , in which the 40 – 48 insert ( yellow ) makes contact with the 354 – 375 insert ( purple ) , and the 197 – 203 insert ( cyan ) makes contact with the 319 – 327 insert ( orange ) . An interaction that is not shown involves the 262 – 274 insert making contact with the opposite strand . ( C ) In contrast , in tilted actin , the 262 – 274 insert ( magenta ) makes contact with the 197 – 203 insert ( cyan ) , and the 40 – 48 insert ( yellow ) makes contact with subdomain 3 of an adjacent subunit . such sequential switching could occur that would never makes an important contact in normal F - actin with sub - domain 1 of a subunit above it on the same long - pitch break all contacts at the same time . It is also possible that the subunit does not rotate as a whole , and large helical strand , now makes contact with subdomain 3 of the subunit above it ( Figure 4C ) . This suggests that internal deformations allow sequential switching within individual subunits . We suggest that the existence of several of these sequence inserts play an extraordinary role in a number of different states of F - actin . such multiple contacts within F - actin provides strong additional constraints against mutation over a large sur - Over the course of eukaryotic evolution , virtually no differences have emerged in the structure of F - actin and face of the actin subunit . The recent determination of a structure for the bacterial MreB protein showed that it only small differences have emerged in the sequence . Traditionally , the existence of large numbers of actin is an actin homolog [ 9 ] and provides a framework for understanding the prokaryotic origin of actin - based mo - binding proteins was invoked to explain the selective pressure that might lead to such a conservation . How - tility , the cytoskeleton , and muscle . Interestingly , there are six sequence inserts that occur in all eukaryotic ever , the actin binding proteins themselves remain far less conserved , suggesting that this argument may be actins that are absent in MreB . Five of these appear to be involved in the subunit - subunit contacts that hold quite incomplete . Just as the ability of actin subunits to exist in states with large differences in twist has been “normal” F - actin together ( Figure 4A ) , with four of the five involved in contacts between inserts . Specifically , shown to be a property of vertebrate (cid:3) muscle [ 2 , 10 ] , vertebrate (cid:2) - cytoplasmic ( V . E . G . et al . , unpublished the DNase I binding loop in subdomain 2 ( insert con - taining residues 40 – 48 ) is involved in contacts with the data ) , and yeast actins [ 13 ] , we now find that an unusual state of tilted , propeller - rotated actin subunits exists in C - terminal insert ( residues 354 – 375 of a subunit above it ) , and a loop in subdomain 4 ( insert containing residues both muscle and yeast actin filaments . We suggest that the ability of F - actin to support such internal modes 197 – 203 ) is involved in contacts with a loop in subdo - main 3 ( insert containing residues 319 – 327 ) of a subunit may have been one of the most important conservative constraints . Since it has previously been shown that the above ( Figure 4B ) . The fifth insert , residues 262 – 274 , contains the “hydrophobic plug” that holds the two crosslinking of subdomain 2 in actin to subdomain 1 of a subunit above it inhibits force generation by myosin , strands of F - actin together [ 28 ] . When the model of the tilted state is examined ( Figure 4C ) , it is found that three without interfering with actin’s activation of myosin’s ATPase [ 29 ] , it is tempting to speculate that an internal of these six inserts appear to be involved in totally new contacts in the filament , with a loop on subdomain 4 mode such as the tilt we now observe may be important for actin’s interaction with myosin and other proteins . ( residues 197 – 203 ) now making a contact with the hy - drophobic plug residues , 262 – 274 , on an adjacent sub - unit . In contrast to the existing model of F - actin [ 28 ] , in Experimental Procedures which this loop containing the hydrophobic plug must Sample Preparation and Electron Microscopy be swung out from its position in crystal structures of Wild - type yeast actin , Q41C mutant actin , disulfide - crosslinked ac - G - actin to make filament contacts , this loop makes rea - tin , and yeast cofilin were gifts from Dr .
