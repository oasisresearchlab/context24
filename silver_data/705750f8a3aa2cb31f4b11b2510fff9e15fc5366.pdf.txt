Many actin ﬁlament end - binding proteins play crucial roles in actin dynamics , since polymerization and depolymerization of actin proto - mers occur only at the ﬁlament ends . We present here an EM structure of the complex of the actin ﬁlament and hetero - dimeric capping protein ( CP ) bound to the barbed - end at 23 A˚ resolution , by applying a newly developed methods of image analysis to cryo - electron micrographs . This structure was ﬁtted by the crystal structure of CP and the proposed actin ﬁlament structure , allowing us to construct a model that depicts two major binding regions between CP and the barbed - end . This binding scheme accounted for the results of newly performed and pre - viously published mutation experiments , and led us to propose a two - step binding model . This is the ﬁrst deter - mination of an actin ﬁlament end structure .

Actin forms a double - stranded helical ﬁlament with a clear polarity ; the polymerization and depolymerization at one end ( barbed - end ) is much faster than the other end ( pointed - end ) . The actin ﬁlament plays cellular roles through its dynamic properties . Especially several types of motility is driven by polymerization and depolymerization ( the actin dynamics ) ( Pantaloni et al , 2001 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . Capping protein ( CP ) binds to the barbed - end of the actin ﬁlament with a high afﬁnity ( K d B 1 nM ) and a 1 : 1 stoichio - metry ( Isenberg et al , 1980 ; Caldwell et al , 1989a ; Schafer et al , 1993 ; Wear and Cooper , 2004 ) , thus preventing the addition and loss of actin monomers at the end . CP is indispensable for the actin dynamics ; the absence of CP prevented the reconstitution of the motility of Listeria and Shigella in vitro ( Loisel et al , 1999 ) . CP ( CapZ in muscle ) stabilizes and targets the actin ﬁlament in muscle ( Casella et al , 1987 ; Schafer et al , 1993 ) . Based on the crystal structure of CP ( Yamashita et al , 2003 ) , we previously proposed ‘the tentacle binding mechanism’ , in which the C - terminus regions ( a - and b - tentacle ) of both CP subunits ( a and b ) extended from the rest of CP ( the main body of CP ) are crucial for its binding to the actin ﬁlament end . In the present work , we obtained an electron microscope ( EM ) structure of the actin – CP complex , which indicated that the a - tentacle must lie extended on the surface of CP , and together with a part of the CP body , displaying the cluster of basic residues . The basic residues must interact with acidic residues on the two end actin protomers simultaneously . The b - tentacle , seen as a freely mobile a - helix in the crystal , may be lifted up to exert hydrophobic interactions with the end protomer . The actin – CP complex structure , together with previous results , led us to propose an intriguing two - step binding mechanism by which the ﬂuctuating actin ﬁlament end is capped by CP . Results Overview of the actin – CP structure Cryo - electron micrographs of the actin – CP complex ( Figure 1 ) were collected and processed by the use of novel procedures , which are described in full detail elsewhere ( Narita and Mae´da , 2006 and Materials and methods ) . This method is based on single particle analysis , and , among various methods for structural biology , this is the ﬁrst for determining actin ﬁlament end structures . For the actin – CP complex , the resolution was evaluated as 23 . 3 A˚ ( Figure 2 ) . In the electron density map thus obtained ( Figure 3A – F ) , individual masses are clearly recognized as actin protomers , except for the bottom mass that is clearly distinct from the rest , for it is more elongated and has a triangle - shaped protrusion on its bottom . This end mass contacts with two masses of actin protomers and ﬁts very well with the crystal structure of CP ( Yamashita et al , 2003 ) , except for some small protruding loops and the b - tentacle ( see below ) . The remain - ing masses follow the canonical actin helix up to the end and ﬁt with the atomic structure of the actin ﬁlament ( Lorenz et al , 1993 ) ( Figure 3G and I ) . The orientation of CP was also unambiguously identiﬁed ; as indicated in Figure 3G , the edge ( orange arrow ) on the left - hand side is longer than that on the right ( red arrow ) , indicating that the a - subunit is on the left side and the b - subunit is on the right side , when the complex is viewed as in Figure 3G .

Below , an actin ﬁlament is presented with the barbed - end down , and the actin protomer at the bottom and the one above it are referred to as protomers B and B - 1 , respectively ( Figure 4A ) . On CP , the interface is formed by the a - tentacle and part of the surface composed of both CP subunits . The a - tentacle ( shown in yellow in Figure 4A and B ) interacts with the inner surface ( the surface that faces the ﬁlament axis ) of actin protomer B , including the hydrophobic plug ( Lorenz et al , 1993 ) ( see below ) , as well as with the bottom of protomer B - 1 , including the C - terminus and the bottom of subdomain - 3 ( Figure 4A and B and Table I ) . Part of the main body of CP binds to the inner surface of protomer B . The interface of CP ( Figure 4E ) bears a cluster of basic residues , which are complementary to a cluster of acidic residues on the interface of the actin protomers ( Figure 4C ) , and thus electrostatic interactions between these two clusters likely play major roles in the interaction . In our ﬁtted atomic model , the hydrophobic plug ( Lorenz et al , 1993 ) of protomer B collides with the a - tentacle . No solid evidence was presented for the conﬁguration of the hydrophobic plug in Lorenz’s model ( Lorenz et al , 1993 ) , which substantially differs from that in the crystal structures of monomeric actin ( Kabsch et al , 1990 ; McLaughlin et al , 1993 ; Schutt et al , 1993 ) . Moreover , the shape of the hydro - phobic plug may differ at the barbed - end , since no other protomer below interacts with the plug . The a - tentacle may also change its conformation , since its temperature factor is relatively high ( Yamashita et al , 2003 ) . In addition , the C - terminal region and the hydrophobic plug of actin might be ﬂexible , even in the middle of the actin ﬁlament ( Kim et al , 2000 ; Yasunaga and Wakabayashi , 2001 ) . Therefore , it is plausible that both sides of the interface undergo some conformational changes upon binding . For example , Glu270 on the hydrophobic plug is included in the acidic cluster ( Table I ) in our current model , and may form an important salt bridge with a basic residue on CP upon conformational change . Mutational analyses Our interpretation that the CP – actin interactions through the a - tentacle are primarily electrostatic was conﬁrmed by the mutation experiments . Three highly conserved basic residues in the a - tentacle ( Figures 4D and 5 ) were replaced ; R260 and R266 are within the interface ( Table I ) , whereas K256 is very close to the interface . We performed elongation assays of the actin ﬁlament ( Figure 6 ) . CP inhibits the elongation , while triple mutants ( KRR256 260 266EEE and KRR256 260 266AAA ) showed dramatically impaired inhibitory activity . Double mutants with inverted charges ( KR256 260EE , KR256 266EE and RR260 266EE ) were more effective than double mutants replaced by alanines ( KR256 260AA , KR256 266AA and RR260 266AA ) . Single mutants with an inverted charge ( K256E , R260E and R266E ) were also more effective than single mutants with alanine ( K256A , R260A and R266A ) , although the effect of the single mutants was limited . These results are consistent with our interpretation . Our ﬁtted model also predicted that E200 ( a ) ( Figure 4E ) , which is not on either tentacle but on the surface of the main body of CP , may also contribute to the CP – actin interaction , since E200 ( a ) can form a salt bridge with either K284 or R290 on actin protomer B ( Figure 4C ) . Our actin ﬁlament elonga - tion tests indicated that E200R reduced the inhibitory activity of CP more than E200A did ( Figure 6 ) . This may indicate that the interactions of CP – actin was suppressed either by an electrostatic effect of the reversed charge of E200R ( a ) . Or the result may be explained in terms of steric hindrance of the side chain of Arg that is bulkier than that of Glu . In either case , the result indicates that E200 contributes to the inter - action of CP to the actin ﬁlament . This is consistent with our docking model , and also with previous results obtained from the yeast cell ( Sizonenko et al , 1996 ) . The electrostatic binding of CP described here represents a novel manner of binding between an actin binding protein and actin . No complex structure is known in which an actin binding protein binds to the inner surface ( the surface that faces the ﬁlament axis ) of the actin protomer ( Dominguez , 2004 ; Aguda et al , 2005 ) . Some small peptides like phalloidin ( Oda et al , 2005 ) and dolastatin - 11 ( Oda et al , 2003 ) , which stabilize actin ﬁlaments , bind to the inner surface . However , they lack charged groups .

Figure 2 Evaluation of the resolution of the obtained 3D electron density map ( Frank , 2002 ) . We divided the images of the actin – CP complex into two groups and reconstructed two 3D maps , which were compared by Fourier Shell Correlation ( van Heel , 1987 ) . The resolution was estimated as 23 . 3A˚ , with a threshold of 0 . 5 . Actin ﬁlament capping at the barbed - end A Narita et al & 2006 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 25 | NO 23 | 2006 5627 Construction of a plausible model for the b - tentacle bound to the actin ﬁlament In contrast to the a - tentacle , the mass assignable to the b - tentacle was not clearly distinguished in our 3D density map ( Figure 3I ) . We propose that the b - tentacle likely inter - acts with the hydrophobic cleft between subdomains 1 and 3 of actin protomer B , as indicated in Figure 7H and I , because of the following four reasons . First , in the crystal structure ( Yamashita et al , 2003 ) , the basal part of the b - tentacle ( residues 246 – 252 ) forms an extended loop that must be ﬂexible ( Figure 7H ) , and no part of the b - tentacle interacts with the main body of CP . Therefore , the b - tentacle is most likely freely mobile . Second , in the crystal structure ( Yamashita et al , 2003 ) , the a - helix of the b - tentacle is amphipathic and the hydrophobic residues , such as L262 and L266 , on the hydrophobic side are well conserved ( Barron - Casella et al , 1995 ) and crucially important for the CP – actin binding ( Barron - Casella et al , 1995 ; Wear et al , 2003 ) . Third , as pointed out by Dominguez ( 2004 ) , many actin - binding proteins interact with the hydrophobic cleft along the boundary between subdomains - 1 and - 3 of the actin protomer , which serves as the binding site for an amphipathic a - helix . Fourth , for this binding , either polarity is possible for the directional relationship between the cleft and the a - helix . By taking these considerations into account , the b - tentacle bound to the actin protomer was modeled , based on the crystal structure of the actin monomer – ciboulot complex ( Figure 7B ) ( Hertzog et al , 2004 ) . The sequences of the actin - binding a - helix of the ciboulot peptide and the Figure 3 The 3D structure of the CP – actin complex obtained by cryo - electron microscopy was ﬁtted with atomic models .

( G , H / G 0 , H 0 ) The atomic structures of CP ( Yamashita et al , 2003 ) and of an actin ﬁlament ( Lorenz et al , 1993 ) ( H / H 0 ) were ﬁtted to and superposed on the 3D density map ( G / G 0 ) and displayed as stereo pairs . ( I , J / I 0 , J 0 ) Same as above , but viewed from the left - hand side of the above . In ( G , H / G 0 , H 0 ) and ( I , J / I 0 , J 0 ) , individual actin protomers are colored light green , green , cyan , blue and purple , respectively , while the a - and b - subunits of CP are orange and red , respectively . In ( H / H 0 ) and ( J / J 0 ) , the a - and b - tentacles of CP are presented in space ﬁlling models in orange and red , respectively . In ( G ) and ( H ) , the orange and red arrows indicate the widths of the left and right edges of CP in the orientation in ( G ) , respectively , in the 3D density map . Actin ﬁlament capping at the barbed - end A Narita et al The EMBO Journal VOL 25 | NO 23 | 2006 & 2006 European Molecular Biology Organization 5628 b - tentacle were aligned ( Figure 7A ) by aligning the repeated hydrophobic residues ( in orange boxes ) , which form the hydrophobic surfaces of amphipathic a - helices . According to this sequence alignment , the two a - helixes were structu - rally aligned using ProFit ( Martin ACR , http : / / www . bioinf . org . uk / software / proﬁt ) . Then , the ciboulot peptide was replaced by the b - tentacle . We also replaced the structure of the monomeric actin in the ciboulot – actin complex ( Figure 7B ) by the actin protomer B in our atomic model for CP – actin ( Figure 4A ) . The resultant model is presented in Figure 7C . In Figure 7H and I , this model is superposed on the atomic model of CP – actin . In the model , the b - tentacle is not extended into the solvent ( in red ) , but lies ( in black ) on the actin protomer B , extending from the backside ( the inner surface ) to the front side ( the outer surface ) of protomer B . It is remarkable that , with this position and polarity , the base of the b - tentacle is located at almost an identical position as that in the CP – actin model . The b - tentacle placed on actin proto - mer B and the b - tentacle in the crystal structure ﬁtted to the EM map are merged at about residues I - 249 and P - 250 , which are within the ﬂexible linker region . This indicates that a simple bend at the ﬂexible basal part translocates the entire b - tentacle from the position found in the crystal structure to the proposed position for the actin binding . The interacting surfaces on b - tentacle and actin are formed by hydrophobic residues ( Figure 7E – G ) , indicating that hydrophobic inter - actions are predominant for b - tentacle binding to actin . A T - test calculation of the density map indicated that the density of the proposed b - tentacle binding surface on the actin protomer B was signiﬁcantly higher than that of the equivalent region on other protomers ( Figure 8 ) . This provides another support for the proposed location of b - tentacle , although this is not a convincing evidence due to the limited resolution of the present density map . Discussions A new actin – CP binding model Here we present a reﬁned model for the binding of CP to the actin ﬁlament B - end ( Figure 9 ) . First , CP is attracted to the barbed - end of the actin ﬁlament through the electrostatic interactions between the basic residues , which are mainly but not exclusively on / around the a - tentacle ( Figure 4E ) , and the acidic residues on the extreme surface at the barbed - end of the actin ﬁlament ( Figure 4C ) . The electrostatic interactions through the a - tentacle may be the major determining factors of the on - rate of the binding . This is because that the deletion of the b - tentacle altered only the off - rate of the binding , without changing the on - rate ( Wear et al , 2003 ) . In contrast , the deletion of the a - tentacle reduced both the on - and off rates ( Wear et al , 2003 ) . Second , the b - tentacle ﬁnds the hydrophobic binding site on the front surface of actin proto - mer B . This occurs because the b - tentacle is freely mobile at the ﬂexible region in its base ( around residues 246 – 252 ) . The binding of the b - tentacle acts as a lock , and thus reduces the off - rate as suggested previously ( Wear and Cooper , 2004 ) . The proposed model dissects the binding into two elementary steps : the ﬁrst step , through the interaction between the a - tentacle and the two end protomers , is of an electrostatic nature , which determines the on - rate , while the second step , through the interaction between the b - tentacle and one end protomer , is of a hydrophobic nature , which determines the off - rate . This two - step binding mechanism implies that the binding is possible even without the b - tentacle . This is because the ﬁrst step alone fulﬁlls two requirements for the barbed - end capping : the recognition of the barbed - end and the inhibition of polymerization and depolymerization . First , the cluster of acidic residues is exposed only at the barbed end , not in the middle or at the pointed end of the ﬁlament , so that the barbed - end is easily recognized by the positively charged region on CP , including the a - tentacle . Second , the binding of CP after the ﬁrst step covers the surface of both protomers B and B - 1 , and thereby prevents the binding of a new actin monomer as well as the detachment of the end protomers . The idea that the capping activity can persist even without the b - tentacle is entirely consistent with the previous experi - mental results ( Kim et al , 2004 ; Wear et al , 2003 ) . The deletion of the a - tentacle weakens the afﬁnity of CP – actin by 5000 - fold , whereas the deletion of the b - tentacle impaired the afﬁnity by only between six - and 400 - fold . Moreover , the deletion of the b - tentacle did not impair the growth rate of the cell , the localization patterns of CP , and the amount of CP at the actin patches in the yeast cell ( Kim et al , 2004 ) .

Since K256 , K260 , and R266 are basic , highly conserved , and exposed on the surface of CP , we selected these residues as mutagenesis targets . R259 is also a basic and conserved residue , but it is buried deep in the core of CP , where it forms multiple salt bridges with other residues , suggesting that the side chain of R259 forms a stable anchorage point ( ‘pivot’ ) of the a - tentacle to the body of CP ( Yamashita et al , 2003 ) . The capping activity of the R259 mutant was examined previously ( Wear et al , 2003 ) . Actin ﬁlament capping at the barbed - end A Narita et al The EMBO Journal VOL 25 | NO 23 | 2006 & 2006 European Molecular Biology Organization 5630 It is also worth noting that the electrostatic interactions are advantageous for the ﬁrst step of the CP – actin binding . The electrostatic interactions between two clusters of homo - genously charged residues like the interaction between CP and actin in our model do not require precise ﬁtting between two surfaces to dock . The actin ﬁlament barbed - end may be dynamic , especially considering the ﬂuctuation of the lateral separation between the two strands , and therefore between protomers B and B - 1 ( T Oda and Y Mae´da , unpub - lished results ) . The electrostatic interactions of CP with both protomers at the end provide a connection between the two protomers . Thus , CP stabilizes the barbed - end , even with its ﬂuctuations . This is the ﬁrst structural determination of the end of an actin ﬁlament . The actin ﬁlament end is particularly important for our understanding of actin ﬁlament dynamics , because polymerization and depolymerization occur only at the end . Our newly established image analysis procedures ( Narita and Mae´da , 2006 ) , which were developed for the present study , are also applicable to the actin ﬁlament end structure in complex with formin , gelsolin , the Arp2 / 3 complex , and tropomodulin ( reviewed in Fischer and Fowler , 2003 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ; Zigmond , 2004 ) . These structures would let us know the mechanism by which the end - binding proteins regulate actin ﬁlament dynamics . Materials and methods Proteins The chicken muscle CapZ a 1 and b 1 ( CP in muscle is referred to as CapZ ) subunits were co - expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) pLys - S ( Novagen ) and were puriﬁed as described ( Soeno et al , 1998 ; Yamashita et al , 2003 ) . The bacterial expression vectors for the mutant CP constructs ( His6 - tagged at the N - terminus of the b - subunit ) were created in the pETDuet vector ( Novagen ) by PCR , using pET - 3d / CP ( Soeno et al , 1998 ) as a template and mutations were introduced by QuikChange Site - Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Stratagene ) . CP variants were expressed in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) and were puriﬁed using Ni - NTA Superﬂow ( Qiagen ) . Actin was Figure 6 Actin ﬁlament elongation assays by the use of various CP mutants . Elongation of the actin ﬁlament ( 1 m M , 5 % pyrene labeled ) from prepolymerized actin ﬁlaments ( 1 . 25 m M ) in the presence of 5 m M CP mutant proteins was measured as the time course ( in s ) of pyrene ﬂuorescence intensity ( in arbitrary units , a . u . ) WT , wild - type CP . The pyrene ﬂuorescence intensity increases in proportion to the amount of actin protomers incorporated in the ﬁlament .

Actin ﬁlament capping at the barbed - end A Narita et al & 2006 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 25 | NO 23 | 2006 5631 prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle , as previously described ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) . For polymerization assay , actin was labeled with pyrenyliodoacetamide as described ( Kouyama and Mihashi , 1981 ) . Actin ﬁlament elongation assay Barbed - end elongation assay was performed essentially as des - cribed ( Harris et al , 2004 ) . Brieﬂy , 1 . 25 m M phalloidin - stabilized actin ﬁlaments and 5 m M CP were premixed in a solution containing 100mM KCl , 2mM MgCl 2 , 2mM EGTA , 20mM imidazole buffer , pH 7 . 0 ( 2 (cid:2) conc . polymerization buffer ) . Polymerization was initiated by mixing the above - indicated solution of actin fragments with an equal volume of the solution that contains 2 m M G - actin ( 10 % pyrene - labeled ) and 5 m M CP , in Mg 2 þ - converted G buffer ( 1mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2mM CaCl 2 , 1mM EGTA , 0 . 2mM ATP , 0 . 5mM DTT , 10mM imidazole buffer , pH 7 . 0 ) . Pyrene ﬂuorescence ( excitation 368nm , emission 388nm ) was monitored at 25 1 C . Cryo - electron microscopy Actin ( 0 . 5mg / ml ) and CP ( 0 . 011mg / ml : at a molar ratio of 70 : 1 ) were mixed and incubated for 45min at 25 1 C , in the solution containing 50mM NaCl , 10mM sodium phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 3mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 005 % ( w / v ) NaN 3 , and 0 . 7mM DTT . Extra CP ( 0 . 0075mg / ml ) was then added to ensure that all of the actin ﬁlament ends were capped . The solution was diluted by the same solution except protein just before the application to the grid . The grid was rapidly frozen by plunging into liquid ethane . The images of the ice - embedded actin – CP complexes were recorded on Kodak SO163 photographic ﬁlm with 5 – 8 m m defocuses at a magniﬁcation of 40000 at 300kV ( 34electron / A˚ 2 dose ) , using a liquid helium stage in a JEOL JEM300 - EFC electron microscope equipped with an energy ﬁlter . The ﬁlms were digitized with a PhotoScan2000 scanner ( Z / I Imaging ) at 7 m m steps ( 1 pixel ¼ 1 . 75A˚ ) . Then the images were shrunk and adjusted so that the ﬁnal pixel size was 3 . 4125A˚ . Image analysis The image analysis was performed by employing our newly established procedures , which were specially designed for single particle analysis of the end structures of the actin ﬁlament ( Narita and Mae´da , 2006 ) . Additional reﬁnement steps were performed on the obtained structure . First , we calculated the Fourier Shell Phase Residual ( FSPR ) ( van Heel , 1987 ) between the projections of the obtained 3D density map and each image on the electron micrographs in two resolution ranges , one between 270 and 42A˚ and the other between 42 and 22A˚ . Those images with FSPR values larger than 60 1 in the ﬁrst range and those with FSPR values larger than 85 1 in the second range were discarded . From the remaining images , a three - dimensional structure was reconstructed . The ﬁrst and the second ranges were chosen so that the resolution of the reconstructed structure from the selected images was signiﬁcantly improved . Second , the azimuth angles of the remaining images were reﬁned using only the region near the end ( within the axial period of 136 . 5A˚ ) . Then , the ﬁnal resolution was evaluated by Fourier Shell Correlation ( van Heel , 1987 ) . All of the image analysis was performed on Eos ( Yasunaga and Wakabayashi , 1996 ) . The ﬁnal 3D electron density map was obtained from 876 images . The ﬁnal map in Figure 3 was presented after passed through a median ﬁlter ( kernel radius ¼ 5 . 1A˚ ) followed by a low - pass ﬁlter ( 23A˚ ) , to reduce the noise . Figure 8 Differences in density distribution between the end pro - tomer and the other protomers . The results of the T - test between actin protomers are indicated on the 3D density map that is related to Figure 3C by a 180 1 rotation . The regions colored red and blue are where the density of the actin protomer was higher or lower , respectively , than that of the rest by 97 % probability . The b - tentacle in the proposed position ( Figure 7H and I , in black ) is superposed and indicated by a black arrow . Around the proposed b - tentacle position was colored red , in spite of that the mass of b - tentacle is small . This is consistent with our binding model of the b - tentacle to actin protomer B . Figure 9 A proposed model for the binding of CP to the actin ﬁlament barbed - end . ( A ) First , the basic residues on the a - tentacle ( blue ) and the acidic residues on the bottom of the actin ﬁlament ( red ) attract each other . This interaction should determine the on - rate of the binding . The unbound b - tentacle ( yellow ) is freely mobile , due to the ﬂexibility at the basal part ( around residues 246 – 252 ) . ( B ) Second , the a - tentacle binds to the bottom of the actin ﬁlament . The b - tentacle remains freely mobile , and searches for its binding position on the actin ﬁlament . ( C ) The b - tentacle binds to the hydrophobic cleft ( yellow ) on the outer surface of the end protomer B . This binding reduces the off - rate of the binding , and thereby stabilizes the binding . Actin ﬁlament capping at the barbed - end A Narita et al The EMBO Journal VOL 25 | NO 23 | 2006 & 2006 European Molecular Biology Organization 5632 Residues at the interface The F - actin atomic model ( Lorenz et al , 1993 ) was ﬁtted to the ﬁnal map ( before being ﬁltered ) by using pdbRhoFit on Eos . The mass associated with the pixels within 3 . 5A˚ from any of the atoms of the ﬁtted model was removed . The remaining volume due to CP was passed through a median ﬁlter ( kernel radius ¼ 5 . 1A˚ ) followed by a low - pass ﬁlter ( 23A˚ ) , to reduce the noise . To the resultant volume , the atomic structure of CP ( Yamashita et al , 2003 ) was ﬁtted by Situs ( Wriggers and Birmanns , 2001 ) . Actin residues with one or more atoms within 6A˚ from the 140 % volume contour of the resultant CP map were assigned as interface residues ( Figure 4A – C ) . To assign the CP residues at the interface ( Figure 4A , B , D and E ) , the reverse procedures were performed ; from the ﬁnal 3D density map , the mass associated with the ﬁtted CP atomic model was removed , and the resultant actin ﬁlament map was passed through the same ﬁlter . CP residues with atoms within 6A˚ from the 140 % volume contour of the resultant actin ﬁlament map were assigned as CP residues at the interface . T - test calculation between actin protomers All the 876 ﬁlament images used in the ﬁnal reconstruction were divided into three groups and , from images of each group , one structure was reconstructed . From each of the three reconstructed structures , actin protomers were extracted one by one from the end actin protomer ( protomer B ) followed by next 19 protomers . In order to know differences in the density distribution of actin protomers at the end relative to the next 19 , T - values were calculated , ﬁrst between three structures of protomer B and the remaining 57 ( ¼ 3 (cid:2) 19 ) extracted structures , followed by between three B - 1 protomers and the remaining 57 , and so on .
