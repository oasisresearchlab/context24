Salanne 1 , 2 Liquids exhibit speciﬁc properties when they are adsorbed in nanoporous structures . This is particularly true in the context of supercapacitors , for which an anomalous increase in performance has been observed for nanoporous electrodes . This enhancement has been traditionally attributed in experimental studies to the effect of conﬁnement of the ions from the electrolyte inside sub - nanometre pores , which is accompanied by their partial desolvation . Here we perform molecular dynamics simulations of realistic supercapacitors and show that this picture is correct at the microscopic scale . We provide a detailed analysis of the various environments experienced by the ions . We pick out four different adsorption types , and we , respectively , label them as edge , planar , hollow and pocket sites upon increase of the coordination of the molecular species by carbon atoms from the electrode . We show that both the desolvation and the local charge stored on the electrode increase with the degree of conﬁnement . 1 UPMC Univ Paris 06 , CNRS , ESPCI , UMR 7195 , PECSA , F - 75005 Paris , France . 2 Re´seau sur le Stockage Electrochimique de l’Energie ( RS2E ) , FR CNRS 3459 , France . 3 Universite´ Paul Sabatier , CIRIMAT , UMR - CNRS 5085 , 31062 Toulouse Cedex 4 , France . 4 Department of Materials , University of Oxford , Parks Road , Oxford OX1 3PH , UK .

S upercapacitors are electrochemical devices which store energy through reversible adsorption of ionic species on electrode surfaces 1 . The amount of electricity which can be accumulated upon charging depends mostly on the number of ionic charges that can be accommodated per unit surface area , but it is not the sole factor . In concentrated electrolytes , and even more in ionic liquids , ions interact strongly with their counterions , leading to non - trivial structural patterns for the adsorbed ionic layers 2 , 3 , thus impacting the supercapacitor performance . In particular , the overscreening effect 4 was shown to be the origin of the low capacitance of planar electrodes . Nanoporous carbons are excellent materials for supercapacitor electrodes 5 – 8 , with enhanced capacitances : owing to conﬁnement effects , the overscreening is quenched , leading to a more efﬁcient charge storage characterized by much higher capacitances 9 and a large electronic screening by the pore walls of like – like ions repulsive Coulombic interactions occurs , allowing for a denser packing of the ions inside the pores 10 , 11 . In fact , the generic name of ‘nanoporous carbons’ identiﬁes a large number of families of compounds , which are synthesized by different pathways . Their structure can be regular ( carbon nanotubes , nanospheres 12 ) or disordered , non - functionalized or activated , leading to a huge variety of atomic - scale environments ( curvature , porosity ) experienced by the ions from the electrolyte . This local structure has barely been investigated by simulation and experimental techniques , and its consequence on the supercapacitor performance remains unknown . Here we characterize via molecular dynamics simulations the various adsorption modes for ions in a disordered nanoporous carbon electrode model and we show that the local charge storage efﬁciency on the electrode surface is strongly correlated with the degree of conﬁnement ( DoC ) of the nearby adsorbed ions . Results Supercapacitors simulations . We have used similar super - capacitor cells to the ones described in reference 9 . They consist of an electrolyte surrounded by two porous electrodes held at constant electrical potential , the latter aspect being important for having a realistic model 13 . In this model , the local charges on the atoms of the electrode vary dynamically in response to the electrical potential caused by the ions and molecules in the electrolyte . The electrode structure mimics that of a carbide - derived carbon ( CDC ) 14 , 15 and two different electrolytes were studied : the ﬁrst consists of the pure ionic liquid 1 - butyl - 3 - methylimidazolium ( BMI þ ) hexaﬂuorophosphate ( PF (cid:2) 6 ) at 400 K and the second of the same ionic species dissolved in acetonitrile ( ACN ) , with a concentration of 1 . 5 M , at 298 K . As in our previous work , we use the coarse - grained models described in the Methods section for these liquids . These have been shown to reproduce their bulk and inter - facial properties extremely well : in particular , we have shown that , when combined with the model porous carbons , this setup yields much higher capacitances than the ones obtained at planar electrodes 9 and in good agreement with experimental values . Although more accurate representation of the interactions could be used , at considerably enhanced computational cost , we note that the typical pore sizes of the carbon involved in the study are larger than the overall mole - cular sizes , so that a good representation of the interactions between the molecules and the pores should be achievable without capturing the full atomistic detail . Here the two systems exhibit integral capacitances of 87 F g (cid:2) 1 and 80 F g (cid:2) 1 , respectively , for an applied potential difference of 1 V between the two electrodes . Local structure characterization . In order to characterize the local structure , we ﬁrst use the simple concept of coordination number . As depicted in Fig . 1 , by deﬁning a spherical cutoff distance R cut , it is possible to determine the number of a given molecular or atomic species coordinated to a central ion ( note that R cut will be different from one pair to the other ) . Following the common practice , we deﬁned R cut as the distance for which the corresponding radial distribution functions show a ﬁrst minimum ; the corresponding values are provided in Supplementary Table S1 . We further deﬁne a DoC for that ion as the percentage of the solid angle around the ion which is occupied by the carbon atoms 16 , normalized by the maximal value taken by this quantity ( which would correspond to the hypothetical case of an ion encaged in a carbon sphere , see Supplementary Fig . S1 for more details ) . The distributions of the DoC experienced by each ionic ( BMI þ , PF (cid:2) 6 ) or solvent ( ACN ) molecule adsorbed in nanopor - ous carbon electrodes held at null potential are shown in the upper panels of Fig . 2 . The values can differ markedly , ranging from 0 % to 90 % , and the occurrence of several broad peaks indicates that the molecules have some preferred DoC . By examining typical conﬁgurations , we have deﬁned four different adsorption modes for the molecules : they can be lying close to ( 1 ) an edge site , that is , a carbon surface with a concave curvature , ( 2 ) a plane , which will have the local structure of a graphene sheet , ( 3 ) an hollow site , that is , a carbon surface with a convex curvature and ( 4 ) a pocket , when they are inside a subnanometre carbon pore with a cylinder - like shape ( lower panel of Fig . 2 ) . Of course , given the wide variety of atomic environments encoun - tered in the CDCs , this limited classiﬁcation necessarily simpliﬁes the situation in the interest of assigning insight into the characteristic structures identiﬁed by the DoC measure . For the pure ionic liquid , a majority of ions is located in edge and plane sites ; a minority being adsorbed in hollow ones . The latter accept a larger number of anions than cations , which is consistent with their relative sizes . As for pocket sites , they are almost empty . On the other hand , for the ACN electrolyte , q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 q 5 q 6 R cut Figure 1 | Local structure characterization . Around each molecular ion , the number of neighbours of each species kind is determined using a spherical cutoff distance R cut . In this example , the central cation ( red spheres ) is surrounded by one anion ( green sphere ) and two ACN ( blue spheres ) molecules . The local counter - charge on the electrode , which is the charge effectively stored , is simply determined by summing all the carbon atom ( grey spheres ) partial charges ( f q i g i 2½ 1 ; 6 (cid:3) in this example ) and normalizing by the charge of one ion . The DoC is the percentage of the solid angle around the ion which is occupied by the carbon atoms , normalized by the maximal value taken by this quantity ( see Supplementary Fig . S1 for details ) . distinct behaviours are observed for the ionic species and the solvent molecules . Owing to their smaller size , the latter can easily be accommodated in small pores and a non - negligible number of ACN molecules are present in the pockets . Both BMI þ and PF (cid:2) 6 ions in the ACN solution tend to lie on sites with lower DoC than in the pure ionic liquid . A few anions remain in hollow sites and the maximum of the distributions has moved to the edge site region for cations . This variation has two origins : First , the ions remain partly solvated in the ACN solution , which increases their effective size . Second , the ﬁlling of the smaller pores by the ACN molecules excludes them from these regions . Partial desolvation of the ions under conﬁnement . As expected from experimental studies 17 , 18 , the adsorption of ions in conﬁned environments leads to their partial desolvation . This is clearly visible on the distributions of the ACN solvent molecule coordination number around each ion , as shown in Fig . 3 for PF (cid:2) 6 ( the data for the cations are provided in Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . In the bulk electrolyte , this distribution is centred around 9 , although occurrences of coordination numbers down to 4 and up to 14 are also observed . The more conﬁned , the less solvated they become , with distributions centred around 8 , 6 – 7 and 5 – 6 for edge , planar and hollow sites , respectively . In the case of pocket sites , it was not possible to extract such a distribution owing to the lack of statistics . Such a large desolvation effect has already been observed experimentally for aqueous solutions by Ohkubo et al . who have showed that Rb þ and Br (cid:2) hydration numbers decrease in slit - shape carbon nanospace by using extended X - ray absorption ﬁne structure spectroscopy 19 . Effect of the electrode potential on the adsorption . When a 1 V potential difference is applied between the electrodes , the number of ions in the electrodes and their DoC change drastically 9 . Figure 4 shows the variation of the DoC experienced by the ionic species ( in the ACN electrolyte ) inside electrodes at (cid:2) 0 . 5 , 0 and þ 0 . 5 V , respectively . When passing from 0 to þ 0 . 5 V , anions are dragged towards the surface and they are less coordinated by cations and ACN . This permits them to enter into more conﬁned pores , and B 30 % of them are now adsorbed in the initially almost ions - free hollow and pocket sites . On the contrary , when the potential is decreased to (cid:2) 0 . 5 V , the few anions which remain inside the electrode occupy almost exclusively edge sites . A symmetrical behaviour is observed for the cations , as shown in Fig . 4 ; a striking point is that despite their relatively large size some of them are able to occupy pocket sites . This clearly shows that in addition to the already reported exchange of ions with the bulk 9 , the charging mechanism of supercapacitors involve drastic rearrangements in the distribution of ions inside the electrode , with a higher propensity for the ions charged oppositely to the electrode to adsorb in highly conﬁned sites ( note that similar patterns are observed for the pure ionic liquid , the corresponding plots are provided in Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . In parallel , we also observe a further desolvation of the ions inside charged electrodes . In the case of hollow and pocket sites , some anions even become solvated by only a single ACN molecule ( data provided in Supplementary Fig . S4 ) , showing the strength of the interaction between the ions and the electriﬁed carbon surface . Our molecular dynamics simulations , performed using a realistic nanoporous carbon structure and allowing for the electrodes to be held at constant potential , provide a detailed picture of the local structure inside supercapacitors . At present , NMR seems to be the most promising experimental technique for probing the local structure inside supercapacitor electrodes . A system very similar to ours ( that is , tetraethylammonium , TEA þ , and tetraﬂuoroborate , BF (cid:2) 4 , ions dissolved in ACN and various CDC electrodes ) was studied by probing the 11 B , 19 F and 1 H chemical shifts with increasing amounts of electrolyte 20 , 21 . In qualitative agreement with the present work , this study identiﬁed the presence of different environments for the conﬁned BF (cid:2) 4 ions , which could be assigned by increasing progressively the quantity of the electrolyte inside the CDC . For low loadings , only one peak is observed , which is thus assigned to ions which are adsorbed inside the nanopores . As the quantity of electrolyte increases , the 5 a b c Edge Plane ( BMI ) ( PF 6 ) (cid:2)(cid:3) = 0 . 0 V (cid:2)(cid:3) = 0 . 0 V Hollow Pocket Edge Plane Hollow Pocket PF 6 – PF 6 – BMI + BMI + ACN 4 F r a c t i on o f i on s ( % ) 3 2 1 0 5 4 F r a c t i on o f i on s ( % ) 3 2 1 0 ACN - ( BMI ) ( PF 6 ) 0 15 30 45 Degree of confinement ( % ) 60 75 90 0 15 30 45 Degree of confinement ( % ) 60 75 90 Figure 2 | Adsorption of the molecular species in a nanoporous carbon electrode at null potential . Upper panel : distribution of the DoC experienced by each ionic or solvent molecule in the pure ionic liquid ( a ) and in the ACN electrolyte ( b ) . Four different adsorption modes are deﬁned . Lower panel ( c ) : representative conﬁgurations for each adsorption mode ( grey rods , C – C bonds ; red , BMI þ ; green , PF (cid:2) 6 ; blue , ACN ; grey spheres , C atoms which are in the coordination sphere of the central molecule ) . intensity of this peak reaches a maximal value and a second peak is observed . The latter was assigned to anions which are in a conﬁned liquid , that is , located in spaces between the primary particles of CDCs . Higher resolution may be possible in the future leading to speciﬁc sites being distinguished , which would allow a quantitative comparison with our simulations . Another recent NMR study focused on the same electrolyte ( [ TEA ] [ BF 4 ] in ACN ) 22 , but with activated carbon electrodes . Two adsorption modes were also observed ; the authors attributed the ﬁrst one to ions that sit between two graphene - like layers , whereas the attribution of the second one appeared more uncertain : the possibilities of adsorption on carbon rings made with ﬁve or seven carbons or on sites perpendicular to graphene planes were hypothesized by the authors . Although based on a different carbon microstructure , these results are also in qualitative accord with the picture proposed in Fig . 2 . Impact of the conﬁnement on the local charge . An advantage of our simulations is that they also provide us with the instanta - neous charge carried by each carbon atom . It is therefore tempting to see how the local surface charge depends on the adsorption mode . We have performed such an analysis by cal - culating the counter - charge on the electrode per adsorbed ion as schematized in Fig . 1 : we calculate the sum of the charges of the carbon atoms located at distances smaller than R cut around a given ion and normalize this quantity by the charge of the ion . It is plotted with respect to the DoC in Fig . 5 for two applied potentials ( 0 V and 1 V ) in the case of the ACN - based electrolyte ( similar trends are obtained for the pure ionic liquid , the corre - sponding data are provided in Supplementary Fig . S5 ) . At null applied potential , the total charge on the electrode oscillates around zero , but locally the carbon atoms can carry a charge : the resulting local charge appears to be completely correlated to the nature of the nearby adsorbed ions , which determine its sign , and to the DoC of the latter . The net counter - charge near ions in edge sites is close to 0 e , whereas higher values ( up to 30 % of the ionic charge ) are obtained in plane and hollow sites . In these cases , the largest charge on an individual carbon atom was 0 . 03 e . For an applied potential of 1 V , a similar trend is obtained but , owing to the higher occupation of hollow and pocket sizes , much larger local charges are observed . We note again a qualitative agreement with the experimental results of Vix - Guterl et al . 23 , who have observed a linear dependence between the capacitance and the ultramicropores volume ( but for different porous carbon / electrolyte combinations ) . It is worth noting that in the positive ( negative ) electrode , the local counter - charge close to cations ( anions ) is positive ( negative ) . It is important to bear in mind that even if the analysis performed here is based on the characterization of the local surface close to a given ion , on the liquid side of the interface other counterions , co - ions ( in smaller quantity 9 ) and solvent molecules are also present and inﬂuence the local counter - charge on the electrode . 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 Solvation number 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 F r a c t i on o f i on s ( % ) BulkHollow 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 Solvation number 0 5 10 15 20 25 F r a c t i on o f i on s ( % ) Bulk Plane 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 Solvation number 0 5 10 15 20 25 F r a c t i on o f i on s ( % ) BulkEdge a b c Figure 3 | Desolvation of anions in conﬁned environment .

Variation of the fraction of ions adsorbed on edge , planar , hollow and pocket sites with the electrode potential ( c ) . Discussion The DoC ( or conversely the extent of decoordination / desolvation of the ion ) has a substantial impact upon the local charge stored on the electrode surface and indicates some key directions for the optimization of materials for supercapacitors . This result conﬁrms the numerous recent electrochemical studies in which an increase of the performance was observed in such materials 5 , 6 , 23 , 24 . From the theoretical point of view , the main effects responsible for the origin of the enhancement of the capacitance with porous electrodes were already established , that is , the electronic screening by the pore walls of the repulsive Coulombic interactions between ions of the same charge and the absence of overscreening effects in the electrolyte 9 , 10 , 11 . This work now goes further by demonstrating unambiguously the key role of the local structure and by revealing the role of coordination and solvation . In qualitative agreement with recent NMR studies , we have shown that the absorbed ions can partition themselves among different adsorption sites in a way which depends on the applied potential 20 – 22 and we have detected four different sites in the case of a given CDC . Depending on the number of carbon atoms which lie in their vicinity , we distinguish edge sites ( concave curvature ) , plane sites ( graphene sheet - like structure ) , hollow sites ( convex curvature ) and pocket sites ( inside a subnanometre carbon pore ) . In parallel , the local charge stored at the surface of the electrode increases as the DoC of the adsorbed ions increases . Although it was observed from experiments and some simulations that the best performances were obtained for CDCs with an average pore size matching the size of the ions 24 – 28 , in a recent theoretical study , Kondrat et al . 29 have shown that the best average pore size depends on the operating voltage . Nevertheless their model was based on a description of the porous carbon based on a distribution of slit - like pores ; the present results show that it would be necessary to inject a more detailed adsorption model to fully address this point . It is also probable that the different adsorption sites will have different behaviour from the dynamic point of view , which may impact the power performances of the device 30 . These results are not only important from the fundamental but also from the practical point of view . Nanoporous carbons may be synthesized by numerous routes , resulting in a huge variety of local structures which differ by their pore size distribution , the presence of defects and so on . The development of spectroscopic techniques may open the possibility for characterizing further the structures on the local scale , and the combination of such data with our simulation results would then allow for the controlled optimization of electrode / electrolyte couples , for example , by choosing directly the best - adapted electrolyte for a given carbon structure . Methods Molecular dynamics simulations . The simulation cells consist of an electrolyte surrounded by two porous carbon electrode ( Supplementary Fig . S6 ) . The ions and molecules of the two electrolytes considered are represented by a coarse - grained model in which the cations and ACN molecules are made of three interaction sites and anions are rendered by a single interaction site 31 , 32 . All the force ﬁeld parameters , including the interactions between electrolyte species and carbon atoms can be found in our previous work 33 . The coarse - grained model was developed in order to yield the correct thermodynamic and transport properties of the bulk liquids 31 , 32 . Note that for the ions , we use the revised version of the force ﬁeld by Roy and Maroncelli , for which the calculated diffusion coefﬁcients match very well the experimental ones on a wide range of temperatures . This model has also been tested in previous simulations involving interfaces with carbon electrodes both for the pure ionic liquid 34 and for solutions in ACN 33 . The results show that the structure of the liquid at the interface and the capacitive properties of the system are in very good agreement with other simulations conducted with all - atom models . The details of the simulation cells are provided in Supplementary Table S2 . The carbon structure for the porous electrodes was obtained through quenched molecular dynamics 15 and corresponds to the experimental structure of a CDC synthesized at 1 , 200 (cid:2) C , with an average pore size of 0 . 9nm . As in our previous works 9 , 13 , where we showed that it is essential to include electrode polarizability , we model the carbon electrode as a perfect conductor . A ﬁxed potential difference D C is imposed between the positive and negative electrodes . The charges are determined at each time step so as to enforce the constant potential condition . Although this methodology is the state of the art in current simulations of supercapacitors 33 , we note recent works in which it was shown that the perfect conductor character could be affected by the effects of ﬁeld penetration 35 . Further simulation work involving more complex models for the electrodes will therefore be tested in the future 36 , although this is probably not feasible for the moment owing to the high computational cost involved for the large porous electrodes . The simulations are conducted in the NVT ensemble with a timestep of 2fs which is consistent with the coarse - grained model used . The temperature is maintained at 400K for the pure ionic liquid and 298K for the ACN electrolyte by applying a Nose´ – Hoover thermostat with a time constant of 10ps . Two - dimensional periodic boundary conditions are used , that is , there is no periodicity in the direction perpendicular to the electrodes , and the Ewald summation is adapted to this set - up 37 , 38 . A special procedure is used to acquire initial conﬁgurations for the production runs . The simulations cells are ‘charged’ and ‘discharged’ a ﬁrst time before starting equilibration runs . This is done by setting the charges of each carbon atom of the carbon electrodes equal to 0 . 002e for 100ps and then changing their values back to 0e . This results in a better ﬁlling of the porous electrodes compared with neutral conditions only . The system is then further equilibrated during 1 . 3ns with a constant charge of 0e on the carbon atoms . During the last nanosecond of this equilibration run , conﬁgurations are extracted every 100ps and used as starting points for the production runs at 0 . 0V . Following the same procedure , the system is equilibrated during 1 . 3ns with constant charges equal to (cid:2) 0 . 01e and þ 0 . 01e on the carbon atoms and conﬁgurations are extracted during the last nanosecond to acquire starting conﬁgurations for the production runs at 1 . 0V . For each potential difference , 10 production runs of 20ps each are conducted leading to a total of 200ps of constant potential simulations . Deﬁnition of the DoC . We deﬁne the DoC as the percentage of the solid angle around ions which is occupied by carbon atoms , normalized by the maximal value taken by this quantity . a b 1 . 6 0 . 8 0 . 0 – 0 . 8 – 1 . 6 1 . 6 0 . 8 0 . 0 – 0 . 8 – 1 . 6 0 Degree of confinement ( % ) Degree of confinement ( % ) ACN - ( BMI ) ( PF 6 ) (cid:2)(cid:3) = 0 . 0 V (cid:2)(cid:3) = 1 . 0 V ACN - ( BMI ) ( PF 6 ) C oun t e r - c ha r ge pe r i on C oun t e r - c ha r ge pe r i on 15 Edge Plane Around PF 6 – Around BMI + Hollow Pocket Edge Plane Hollow Pocket Positiveelectrode Negativeelectrode 30 45 60 75 90 0 15 30 45 60 75 90 Figure 5 | Effect of conﬁnement on the efﬁciency of charge storage . The counter - charge on the electrode per adsorbed ion , calculated as schematized in Fig . 1 is plotted versus the DoC of the ion , for applied potentials of 0V ( a ) and 1V ( b ) in the case of the ACN - based electrolyte . For a given ion i , the solid angle associated with a carbon atom j , located at a distance d i ; j from this ion , is given by 16 : a i ; j ¼ 2 p ½ 1 (cid:2) cos ð y i ; j Þ(cid:3) ¼ 2 p 1 (cid:2) d i ; j ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ d 2 i ; j þ R 2 j q 0 @ 1 A ; ð 1 Þ where R j is the radii of the region occupied by j . In the porous electrodes modelled in this work , most of the carbon atoms are part of cycles comprising six carbon atoms . As a consequence , the carbon – carbon distance is nearly constant and equal to 1 . 43Å . Thus , it seems adapted to choose R j equal to half of this carbon – carbon distance . For a perfectly dense system , the total solid angle around a given ion can reach the maximal value of 4 p . But , as depicted in Supplementary Fig . S1 , for graphitic structures , the cycle surface is not completely covered by the carbon atoms . A quick geometrical examination shows that only 60 . 46 % of the surface is effectively covered . With these considerations , we now write the DoC for a given ion i as follows : P CN j ¼ 1 a i ; j 4 p (cid:4) 0 ; 6046 (cid:4) 100 ; ð 2 Þ where CN is the carbon coordination number around ion i .
