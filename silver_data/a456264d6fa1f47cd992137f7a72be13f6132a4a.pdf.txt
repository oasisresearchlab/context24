Here we describe a novel phenomenon , 35 by which cells sense and restore mechanically induced PM nano - scale 36 deformations . We show that cell stretch and subsequent compression reshape the 37 PM in a way that generates local membrane evaginations in the 100 nm scale . 38 These evaginations are recognized by the I - BAR protein IRSp53 , which triggers 39 a burst of actin polymerization mediated by Rac1 and Arp2 / 3 . The actin 40 polymerization burst subsequently re - flattens the evagination , completing the 41 mechanochemical feedback loop . Our results demonstrate a new 42 mechanosensing mechanism for PM shape homeostasis , with potential 43 applicability in different physiological scenarios . 44 Teaser 45 Cell stretch cycles generate PM evaginations of ≈ 100 nm which are sensed by 46 IRSp53 , triggering a local event of actin polymerization that flattens and 47 recovers PM shape . 48 2 49 Introduction 50 Cells constantly exchange information with their surroundings , and external 51 inputs are first received by their outermost layer , the plasma membrane ( PM ) . 52 This interface , far from being an inert wall , integrates and transmits incoming 53 stimuli , ultimately impacting cell behaviour . In this context , the traditional view 54 of such stimuli as biochemical messengers has now changed to include the 55 concept that physical perturbations are also of major importance ( 1 – 3 ) . By 56 sensing and responding to physical and biochemical stimuli , one of the main 57 functions of the PM is to adapt to the changes in shape that cells experience as 58 they migrate or are mechanically deformed , in a variety of physiological 59 conditions ( 4 – 9 ) . To date , research in this area has largely focused on the 60 regulation of PM area and tension , at the level of the whole cell ( 10 – 12 ) . For 61 instance , cell stretch or decrease in medium osmolarity have been commonly 62 used to raise PM tension , unfolding membrane reserves ( ruffles , caveolae ) , 63 inhibiting endocytosis and promoting exocytosis ( 13 – 17 ) . Conversely , cell 64 exposure to a hypertonic solution or cell compression have been employed to 65 decrease PM tension , leading to an increase on the activity of different endocytic 66 pathways ( 18 – 21 ) . These studies have shown that PM tension homeostasis is 67 maintained by regulating PM area through mechanisms like endocytosis , 68 exocytosis , or the assembly and disassembly of PM structures like ruffles and 69 caveolae . 70 However , changes in cell PM area upon mechanical perturbations are 71 necessarily accompanied by changes in topography at the local scale . This is 72 clearly exemplified by caveolae flattening upon cell stretch ( 22 ) or creation of 73 PM folds at the sub - µm scale upon cell compression ( 20 ) . Curvature also arise 74 when membranes are exposed to either external topographical cues ( 23 , 24 ) or 75 internal pulling by actin filaments ( 25 – 27 ) . To maintain PM homeostasis , cells 76 should thus be able to not only respond to overall changes in PM tension or area , 77 but also to local changes in PM topography . This requirement is even clearer if 78 one considers recent findings showing that tension does not propagate 79 extensively throughout the whole ensemble of the PM , but dissipates in small 80 areas of less than 5 µ m ( 28 ) . However , if such local PM shape homeostasis 81 mechanisms exist , and how they operate , is still unknown . 82 Here , we studied this problem by using as a model the controlled compression of 83 fibroblasts through the application and release of stretch . We show that upon cell 84 compression , bud - shaped PM deformations of negative curvature ( evaginations ) 85 on the 100 nm scale are formed and enriched by IRSp53 , a negative curvature - 86 sensing protein . This creates a local node where specific PM topography is 87 selectively coupled through IRSp53 to activate actin polymerization mediated by 88 Rac1 and Arp2 / 3 . The activation of this cascade flattens the structure , recovering 89 the PM shape to its initial state . Our findings demonstrate a local 90 mechanosensing mechanism that controls PM homeostasis when perturbed 91 through compression . 92 93 Results 94 Compression generates dynamic PM evaginations of 100 nm in width . 95 3 To study how PM topography is regulated , we submitted normal human dermal 96 fibroblasts ( NHDF ) transfected with an EGFP - membrane marker to a 97 physiologically relevant 5 % equibiaxial stretch by using a custom - made stretch 98 system composed by a PDMS stretchable membrane clamped between two 99 metal rings , as previously described in ( 29 ) ( see methods ) . Cell response during 100 and after stretch was monitored by live fluorescence imaging . As previously 101 described , when tensile stress was applied cells increased their area by depleting 102 PM reservoirs , such as ruffles ( 10 , 20 ) . After 3 minutes , stretch was released , 103 resulting in a compression stimulus . At this point , excess membrane was stored 104 again in folds , visualized as bright fluoresce nt spots of ≈ 500 nm ( Fig . 1A and 105 Supp . Video SV01 ) . These spots incorporate approximately 1 . 5 % of PM area 106 ( Supp . Fig . 1A ) , and thus store an important fraction of the area modified by cell 107 stretch . As we have previously published ( 20 ) , these spots are formed passively 108 by the PM to accommodate compression , analogously to what occurs when 109 compressing synthetic lipid bilayers ( 30 ) . In cells however , passive fold 110 formation is followed by active resorption involving actin cytoskeleton 111 rearrangements , allowing for topography equilibration within 2 minutes ( Fig . 112 1B ) . As the diffraction limit of a standard fluorescence microscope lays in the 113 range of 500 nm , we characterized the structure of the compression - generated 114 folds in more detail using electron microscopy . Cells transfected with a PM 115 marker were seeded in a 3D patterned PDMS membrane , stretched and 116 immediately fixed after the release of the stimulus . Next , brightfield and 117 fluorescent images of the 3D pattern and the cells on it were acquired and 118 samples were further processed for SEM imaging . Computational alignment 119 tools allowed for correlation between brightfield , fluorescence and SEM images . 120 De - stretched cells displayed numerous bud - shaped evaginations at their apical 121 PM side that correlated with the bright spots seen by fluorescence ( Figs . 1C and 122 D ) , showing that the PM bends outwards ( thereby minimizing friction with the 123 underlying cortex ) . To accurately measure the size of these evaginations we 124 moved into transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . By comparing non 125 stretched to stretched - released cells , we observed that the first displayed a 126 homogeneously flat PM , while the second group displayed bud - shaped 127 evaginations on the apical side ( Fig . 1E ) . Analysis of the shape profile of 128 compression - induced evaginations yielded an average diameter in the neck 129 ( cylindrical shape ) of 83 nm and of 115 nm in the head ( spherical shape ) , and 130 average curvatures of 0 . 03 and 0 . 02 nm - 1 respectively ( Figs . 1F , G and H ) . 131 These data indicate that PM compression led primarily to the formation of 132 evaginations of regular size and shape at the apical side , which are immediately 133 resorbed by the cell in an active process to re - equilibrate PM topography and 134 tension . 135 Actin is recruited to evaginations through the curvature - sensing protein 136 IRSp53 . 137 In light of these results , we wondered if the PM evaginations formed upon 138 compression could be detected by the cell , triggering a mechanism to recover 139 PM shape . Based on previous results showing that actin depolymerization by 140 either Latrunculin A or Cytochalasin D blocked PM remodeling after stretch 141 ( 20 ) , we hypothesized that the first step for recovery likely involved 142 reattachment of the evaginated PM to the actin cortex . To explore this idea , we 143 4 submitted NHDFs to a cycle of stretch and we imaged their response after 144 stretch release . To visualize actin dynamics , cells were co - transfected with a PM 145 marker together with a plasmid expressing an actin nanobody bound to a GFP 146 fluorophore ( ACG ) . As evaginations were being resorbed , actin was recruited to 147 the same spot ( Fig . 2A and Supp . Video SV02 ) . Quantification of fluorescence 148 intensity of PM and ACG markers showed a recruitment of actin which was 149 delayed with respect to the PM marker ( Figs . 2B and C ) , reaching a maximum at 150 15 s . This was followed by a decrease in the intensity of both markers that 151 concluded when evaginations were resorbed ( Fig . 2B ) . This suggests that the 152 PM quickly reattaches to the underlying cortex , which then mediates remodeling 153 of the structure . To further confirm the hypothesis and to prevent any 154 mechanical interference caused by actin manipulation ( 31 ) , we repeated the 155 same experiment over - expressing the PM - cortex linker ezrin ( 32 , 33 ) . 156 mEmerald - Ezrin also co - localized with evaginations during their resorption ( Fig . 157 2D and Supp . Video SV03 ) and fluorescence analysis of PM and ezrin markers 158 revealed a recruitment of the protein that mimicked , with a delay of 10 s , the one 159 seen with actin ( Figs . 2E and F ) . 160 The burst in actin polymerization at the evaginated PM and the simultaneous 161 reattachment to the cortex suggest that the local topography generated by 162 compression may act as the mechanical input triggering the subsequent 163 polymerization event . Indeed , membrane curvature can recruit different 164 signaling molecules ( 19 , 34 – 37 ) , chief among them curvature - sensing BAR 165 proteins ( 38 – 41 ) . The superfamily of BAR proteins includes molecules 166 containing different curvature sensing and generating BAR domains : The N - 167 BAR and F - BAR domains , which interact with positively curved membranes 168 ( invaginations ) , and the I - BAR domain for the opposite type of curvature 169 ( negatively curved membranes or evaginations ) . In addition , these proteins also 170 contain other domains , many of them reported to recruit actin nucleation 171 promoting factors ( NPFs ) or even directly binding actin monomers ( 42 ) . 172 Interestingly , a recent work described how ezrin needs to act in partnership with 173 the I - BAR protein IRSp53 to enrich in negatively curved membranes ( 43 ) . 174 Previous work done on IRSp53 has related this protein to PM ruffling ( 44 , 45 ) , 175 filopodia formation ( 46 – 49 ) and endocytosis ( 50 ) , but , so far , no 176 mechanosensing mechanism relying on its capacity to bind negatively - curved 177 membranes has been described . Moreover , recent studies in vitro and in vivo 178 have pointed out that the I - BAR domain of IRSp53 displays a peak of sorting at 179 evaginations with curvatures of 0 . 05 nm - 1 , and that lower curvature values 180 comparable to the ones obtained by TEM imaging of our evaginations also led 181 to a two - fold enrichment of this domain with respect to a control membrane 182 marker ( 47 , 51 ) . 183 Prompted by this idea , we tested if IRSp53 could be the molecular linker 184 between PM shape and actin dynamics in our system . To do so , we created 185 stable cell lines expressing IRSp53 shRNA and control Non - Targeting shRNA 186 ( NT - shRNA ) . By plotting the decrease in PM fluorescence at the location of the 187 evagination as a function of time for both control and IRSp53 silencing , we 188 compared how lack of this protein affected the resorption process of PM 189 evaginations ( Supp . Figs . 1B and C and Supp . Video SV04 ) . To assess the 190 effectiveness of resorption ( and since not all curves in all conditions could be 191 5 fitted to an exponential equation with a characteristic time scale ) , we compared 192 residual PM fluorescence at the end of experiments , 180 s . Full reabsorption of 193 evaginations leads to a complete return to fluorescent baseline , while presence 194 of a residual fluorescence indicates non - reabsorbed evaginations . Concordant 195 with our hypothesis , IRSp53 - depleted NHDFs did not complete evaginations 196 resorption after 180 s ( Supp . Figs . 1C , D and Suppl . Video SV04 ) , even though 197 they stretched by the same amount as non - depleted cells ( Supp . Fig . 1E and 198 Supp . Video SV05 ) . To corroborate this result , we used isogenic mouse 199 embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) derived from IRSp53 null mice , that were stably 200 infected either with a control ( IRSp53 - / - ) or an IRSp53 - retroviral vector ( IRSp53 - 201 / - R ) to restore expression levels of IRSp53 similar to wild type fibroblasts , as 202 previously described ( 52 – 54 ) . IRSp53 - / - cells also stretched by the same amount 203 as IRSp53 - / - R cells ( Supp . Fig . 1F ) and did not display significant changes in the 204 number of evaginations generated after compression ( Supp . Fig . 1G ) or in the 205 area stored by those ( Supp . Fig 1H ) . However , and reinforcing the previous 206 result , they showed a severe impairment in the resorption of the evaginations 207 even 180 s after stretch release . We further re - introduced EGFP - tagged full - 208 length ( FL ) wild type IRSp53 into IRSp53 - / - by transient transfection . The 209 reintroduction of IRSp53 - FL rescued the phenotype , leading to a full recovery of 210 PM topography by resorbing the compression - generated evaginations in a lapse 211 of 90 s ( Figs . 2G - I and Supp . Videos SV06 , SV07 , SV08 ) . Further , IRSp53 - / - 212 cells exhibited a recruitment of actin to PM evaginations that was weakened 213 with respect to IRSp53 - / - R cells ( Fig . 2J - M and Supp . Videos SV09 and SV10 ) , 214 illustrating that actin assembly at the PM evaginations is dependent on the 215 presence of the I - BAR protein . 216 Next , we tested whether the effect of IRSp53 in PM reshaping was local at 217 evaginations , or a general non - specific cell - level effect due to the ability of 218 IRSp53 to organize different NPFs ( 55 , 56 ) . To this end , we generated PM folds 219 of very different nature and curvature . We transiently exposed cells to hypo - 220 osmotic medium , leading to cell swelling . As previously described , re - exposure 221 to iso - osmotic medium generates a water outflow from cells . For cells seeded on 222 non - porous substrate such as PDMS , expelled water becomes trapped between 223 the cell and the substrate , forming the dome - shaped invaginations known as 224 vacuole - like dilations ( VLDs ) . VLDs are much larger than compression - 225 generated bud - shaped evaginations ( several µm in size ) , with much lower 226 curvature , and resorb in the order of minutes ( 20 ) . Confirming the local , 227 evagination - specific effect of IRSp53 , VLD resorption was equivalent in 228 IRSp53 - / - R and IRSp53 - / - cells ( Supp . Fig . 2A , B , C and Supp . Videos SV11 and 229 SV12 ) . IRSp53 has also been related to actin polymerization in lamellipodia ( 44 , 230 57 ) . To discard that flattening of the evaginations was due to potential 231 lamellipodial extension ( cell spreading ) after compression , we analyzed cell 232 spreading dynamics . After a stretch - release cycle , cells did extend lamellipodia 233 and spread during approximately 1 minute ( Suppl . Fig . 2D ) . However , the time 234 constant of spreading ( obtained by fitting an exponential curve to the 235 experimental curve ) and the amount of area recovered were not altered by the 236 loss of IRSp53 ( Supp . Fig . 2E - G ) , discarding a role of this process in the 237 resorption of evaginations . 238 6 Homeostasis recovery after stretch requires integrity of SH3 and IBAR 239 IRSp53 domains 240 So far , we have shown that PM remodeling of compression - generated 241 evaginations is a local event , which depends on IRSp53 to organize a burst of 242 actin polymerization that flattens the PM . Next , we investigated if this could be 243 part of a mechanosensing mechanism . Indeed , the I - BAR domain of IRSp53 244 may recognize the curvature generated at the evaginations and further recruit 245 NPFs to coordinate the polymerization event . However , IRSp53 possesses 246 multiple domains with multiple interactors , as illustrated in Fig . 3A . First , the I - 247 BAR domain of IRSp53 can not only interact with charged curved membranes , 248 but also possesses a Rac Binding domain ( RCB ) which enables binding to 249 activated Rac . Additionally , it has been described to bundle actin ( 58 ) . IRSp53 250 also contains an atypical CRIB domain that binds to activated Cdc42 , but not 251 Rac1 ( 59 ) and , further , an SH3 domain that recruits different NPFs , such as 252 WAVE2 , Eps8 or N - WASP ( 55 ) . To test the role of these different domains , we 253 used a cohort of IRSp53 mutants each affecting a specific domain and impeding 254 a specific interaction , as described in Fig . 3B . EGFP - labelled mutants disrupting 255 the function of IBAR , CRIB and SH3 domains were expressed in the 256 background of IRSp53 - / - cells , and PM remodeling after stretch was analyzed . 257 Whereas a set of mutants was able to rescue the wild type phenotype ( Figs . 3C , 258 D and F ) , another group was not ( Fig . 3C , E and G ) . The I - BAR mutant 4KE , in 259 which positively charged Lysines 142 , 143 , 145 and 147 belonging to a basic 260 patch involved in PM and actin binding were replaced by negatively charged 261 Glutamic Acid to disrupt this interaction ( 58 , 60 ) , rescued the phenotype ( Supp . 262 Video SV13 ) . Mutation of these amino acids was probably not efficient enough 263 in preventing PM binding . Phenotype recovery was also observed with the 264 I268N mutant in the CRIB domain , which impairs the interaction with Cdc42 265 ( Supp . Video SV14 ) . However , the full deletion of the I - BAR domain or point 266 mutations I403P and W413G in the SH3 , that impair the association of IRSp53 267 with all its SH3 interactors , including WAVE2 ( 61 ) , VASP and Eps8 ( 52 , 62 ) , 268 did not rescue homeostasis recovery after stretch release ( Supp . Videos SV15 , 269 16 and 17 ) . Moreover , the over - expression of the I - BAR domain alone also 270 failed to rescue the phenotype ( Supp . Video SV18 ) , suggesting that the 271 interaction with the PM and active Rac1 is not sufficient to drive PM flattening 272 in response to stretch . This ensemble of results points at a mechanism where the 273 I - BAR domain of IRSp53 would interact with the curved membrane of 274 evaginations , leading to actin polymerization via active Rac1 and activation of 275 NPFs through its SH3 domain . 276 IRSp53 acts as a mechanosensor by recognizing mechanically - induced PM 277 curvature 278 To evaluate whether IRSp53 itself was directly recruited to evaginations , we 279 imaged the dynamics of the EGFP - IRSp53 - FL or mutant forms , expressed in 280 IRSp53 - / - cells . Colocalization of the fluorescently labeled protein , either WT or 281 mutated , and the PM marker was found in all cases ( Supp . Fig . 3A - G ) , 282 indicating that the presence of IRSp53 in the PM is not mediated exclusively by 283 the I - BAR domain and rather occurs as an interplay of all different domains , as 284 already suggested in previous studies ( 63 , 64 ) . We next analyzed the dynamics 285 7 of EGFP - IRSp53 - FL at the resorbing evaginations . Because IRSp53 is already 286 bound to the PM , colocalization of the protein with the evaginations was 287 observed from the first timepoint after stretch release . However , the decay in 288 fluorescence of the IRSp53 coupled fluorophore was significantly slower than 289 that of the PM marker ( Figs . 4C and D ) , indicating that there is a progressive 290 enrichment of IRSp53 to the evaginations while those are disappearing . To 291 confirm this , we used APEX technology ( 65 , 66 ) to visualize IRSp53 at PM 292 evaginations using TEM . We co - transfected IRSp53 - / - cells with csAPEX2 - GBP , 293 a conditionally stable APEX marker bound to a nanobody specifically 294 recognizing GFP ( also called GFP - binding protein , GBP ) , and either EGFP - 295 IRSp53 - FL or a GFP - bound mitochondrial marker ( Mito - GFP ) . As expected , a 296 strong APEX signal ( visible as a darker signal in the TEM image ) was observed 297 around the mitochondrial membrane for Mito - GFP - transfected cells ( Supp . Fig . 298 3M ) , and at the tip of filipodia for EGFP - IRSp53 - FL transfected cells ( Supp . 299 Fig . 3N ) ( 47 , 50 ) . Confirming that IRSp53 is recruited to PM evaginations 300 generated by a stretch - release cycle , such evaginations showed an increase in 301 APEX signal in IRSp53 - FL transfected cells ( Fig . 4E ) , but not in control mito - 302 GFP transfected cells ( Fig . 4F ) . 303 Given that IRSp53 recognizes evaginations , we checked whether different 304 mutants recognized the structure differently . The fluorescence dynamics of the 305 IRSp53 mutants that had little effect on PM evaginations resorption followed a 306 similar decay to the WT form ( Supp . Figs . 3H and I ) . However , the mutants 307 slowing down the resorption followed different dynamics , with an initial 308 recruitment phase before the decay in fluorescence ( Fig . 4G and Supp . Figs . 3J - 309 L ) . This is illustrated in its most prominent example by the ΔIBAR mutant ( Fig . 310 4G ) . These results indicate a delay in the recruitment of IRSp53 WT to the 311 curved PM upon stretch as well . Indeed , due to the experimental time required to 312 refocus samples and start imaging after compression ( around 5 - 10 s ) , our time 313 lapses fail to capture the process of PM evagination formation , or the 314 recruitment of WT IRSp53 . However , when the process is impaired due to 315 IRSp53 mutations , dynamics are slowed down and we can capture the 316 recruitment phase . 317 This led us to hypothesize that , although presence at the PM is a feature that 318 does not depend on a single domain , recruitment at the curved evaginations 319 could define the efficiency of homeostasis recovery after stretch . To quantify 320 this , we measured the lag time between the timepoints of maximum intensity of 321 the fluorescence signals of the PM and of the different IRSp53 mutant proteins 322 ( as illustrated in Fig . 4G ) . Confirming our hypothesis , plotting the lag time 323 against the PM fluorescence intensity of the PM marker after 180 s ( used 324 previously as a marker for the efficiency of resorption of the evaginations ) led to 325 a strong positive correlation ( Fig . 4H ) : the more IRSp53 recruitment was 326 delayed with respect to the PM marker , the less efficient the resorption was . 327 Removal of the I - BAR domain displayed the longest lags and the least efficient 328 resorption , supporting the idea that curvature sensing through this domain is 329 needed to couple the mechanical stress to active PM remodeling . If the domain 330 is absent , IRSp53 cannot perform a quick binding to the evagination and start 331 the mechanochemical loop . I403P and W413G mutations of the SH3 domain 332 also led to long lags and inefficient resorption . Although in this case the I - BAR 333 8 domain is not impaired , lack of interaction of IRSp53 with NPFs , which could 334 be already bound to the PM and target IRSp53 there ( 56 , 64 ) , could delay both 335 recruitment and the subsequent resorption process . Similarly , the I268N - CRIB 336 mutant is probably delayed due to the lack of interaction with active Cdc42 337 already bound to the PM . Nevertheless , this delay is short and does not impair 338 evagination resorption , also because all the different effectors involved in PM 339 remodeling can still be recruited by IRSp53 . In the case of the I - BAR domain 340 alone , which senses PM curvature and couples it to active Rac1 , the delay in 341 recruitment was similar to SH3 mutants but with a stronger impairment in 342 homeostasis recovery . This suggests that the IBAR domain alone , which is 343 expected to be already bound to PM to a certain extent before evagination 344 formation ( 67 ) , keeps on aggregating at the curved structures in accordance with 345 the sensing mechanism proposed for BAR domains ( 42 , 51 ) , but evagination 346 flattening is impaired by the lack of remaining domains . 347 Taken together , these data indicate that the recruitment of IRSp53 to the 348 mechanically induced bud - shaped evaginations is necessary for the PM to be 349 successfully remodeled after stretch . The efficiency in the recruitment of this 350 protein ultimately determines the ability of the cell to set in place the fast 351 mechanism mediating PM flattening in response to the physical perturbation . 352 Actin polymerization is driven by Rac1 and Arp2 / 3 activation 353 Our results point at a role of active Rac1 and further interaction with NPFs to 354 successfully perform PM homeostasis recovery after stretch . Previous work on 355 PM ruffling showed that IRSp53 couples Rac1 to the activation of the WAVE 356 Regulatory Complex ( WRC ) , and the subsequent nucleation of branched actin 357 filaments mediated by Arp2 / 3 ( 68 – 70 ) . However , activation of Arp2 / 3 358 downstream of IRSp53 can also be mediated by Cdc42 and N - WASP ( 41 , 56 , 359 59 ) and , additionally , IRSp53 can coordinate the action of formins mDia1 and 360 mDia2 , which drive actin polymerization related to filopodia formation ( 48 , 71 ) . 361 Finally , PM reattachment to the actin cortex may also rely on contractile 362 mechanisms mediated by myosin and not only actin polymerization , as in the 363 case of blebs ( 72 ) . To discriminate between these mechanisms , we treated 364 IRSp53 - / - R cells with different inhibitors and examined evagination resorption 365 after compression . First , cell treatment with 10 µM of the N - WASP inhibitor 366 Wiskostatin ( 73 ) reduced filopodia number as expected ( 74 ) ( Supp . Figs . 4A and 367 B ) , but did not modify evagination resorption ( Figs . 5A , E and I and Supp . 368 Video SV19 ) . Of note , this is consistent with our finding that evagination 369 resorption is not impaired in I268N - CRIB mutant condition in which IRSp53 370 interaction with Cdc42 is impaired . Second , treatment with 15 µ M of the formin 371 inhibitor SMIFH2 ( 75 ) reduced the number of filopodia as expected ( 76 ) ( Suppl . 372 Fig . 4C and D ) , but did not affect evagination resorption either ( Figs . 5B , F and 373 J and Supp . Video SV20 ) . Third , treatment with 10 µ M of the myosin II 374 inhibitor Para - nitroblebbistatin ( 77 ) affected the integrity of stress fibers as 375 expected ( 78 ) , ( Supp . Fig . 4E ) but , again , did not impair evagination resorption 376 ( Figs . 5C , G and K and Supp . Video SV21 ) , highlighting that actin 377 polymerization alone is sufficient to drive PM flattening . Consistently and more 378 importantly , treatment with the Arp2 / 3 inhibitor CK - 666 ( 79 ) significantly 379 9 impaired evagination resorption in comparison to DMSO treated controls ( Figs . 380 5D , H and L and Supp .

IRSp53 has been described to indirectly promote Arp2 / 3 - 384 mediated actin polymerization acting both as an upstream ( 80 ) and downstream 385 regulator of the small GTPase Rac1 . To verify whether this was the case in our 386 system , we examined evagination resorption after overexpressing constitutively 387 active ( G12V ) and dominant negative ( T17N ) forms of Rac1 . Confirming the 388 involvement of Rac1 , the expression of Rac1 - G12V accelerated evagination 389 resorption significantly whereas Rac1 - T17N slowed it down in NHDF ( Supp . 390 Figs . 5A , B and C ) . Finally , and further showing that Rac1 activation is 391 sufficient to trigger evagination resorption , overexpression of constitutively 392 active Rac1 - G12V drastically accelerated evaginations resorption even in the 393 background of IRSp53 - / - cells ( Supp . Fig . 5D , E and F ) , consistent with an 394 ancillary / modulatory role of IRSp53 in mediating Rac1 - dependent activation of 395 the WAVE / Arp2 / 3 complexes . 396 A mechanical mechanism for actin - mediated evagination flattening 397 Previous work on IRSp53 - mediated actin polymerization described the 398 formation of out - of - plane protrusions in the form of filopodia or lamellipodia 399 ( 41 , 48 , 49 , 51 , 62 , 80 ) . The physical mechanism supporting further protrusion 400 relies on the natural notion that polymerization induces out - of - plane forces on 401 the PM ( 81 ) , which in the case of polymerization by Arp2 / 3 should push 402 outwards , or at least stabilize protrusions ( 82 ) . At larger scales , polymerization 403 of an actin cortex retracts and flattens cellular blebs , but this mechanism 404 depends on myosin contractility ( 72 ) , and hence is not applicable here . In 405 contrast , our results show a novel flattening rather than protruding response . To 406 propose a plausible mechanism , we developed a theoretical model coupling the 407 PM and the actin cortex ( see methods ) . We hypothesized that , rather than out - of - 408 plane forces , flattening may be the result of in - plane actin flows around 409 evaginations . We thus approximated the actin cortex as a flat 2D active gel . In 410 this model , the PM is adhered to the underlying cortex from which it can 411 delaminate , and experiences frictional in - plane forces proportional to relative 412 slippage ( 28 ) . This is coupled to our previous model describing interactions 413 between the PM and curved proteins ( 83 ) . We coarse - grained the signaling 414 pathway triggered by IRSp53 localization and leading to actin polymerization 415 through a regulator species with normalized areal density 𝜓𝜓 , which is produced 416 beyond a threshold in IRSp53 enrichment , degraded , and transported by 417 diffusion , with dynamics on time - scales comparable to those of actin dynamics . 418 The effect of this regulator is to locally favor actin polymerization by the Arp2 / 3 419 complex , and hence bias the competition between a formin - polymerized 420 contractile network component and a branched extensile component ( 84 , 85 ) . 421 We thus modelled the mechanical effect of local polymerization by locally 422 reducing contractility . 423 Our model predicted that curvature - sensitive IRSp53 molecules became 424 enriched in the evagination within a second after its formation . This led to 425 10 recruitment of the regulator species 𝜓𝜓 , resulting in a tension gradient in the 426 vicinity of the evagination . In turn , this induced a centrifugal cortical flow , 427 which frictionally dragged the membrane outwards until flattening . In the 428 absence of curvature , the IRSp53 - enriched domain dissolved , the regulator 429 species recovered its uniform baseline , and the cortex recovered its quiescent 430 steady - state ( Fig . 5M and N ) . Whereas predicted actin flows occur at a scale 431 well below the diffraction limit and can therefore not be observed 432 experimentally , the predicted relative trends of PM and regulator densities 433 qualitatively match our experimental observations when comparing PM and 434 actin ( Fig . 2B ) or ezrin ( Fig . 2E ) . We note that in the real system , the proposed 435 mechanism based on in - plane actin flows and cortex - PM friction should 436 compete with the classical mechanism based on out - of - plane forces . This may 437 explain why resorption dynamics in experiments ( Fig . 2B and E ) were 438 significantly longer and less abrupt than those predicted by the model ( Fig . 5N ) . 439 Predictions are also consistent with our observation that evagination resorption 440 is impaired when inhibiting Arp2 / 3 ( Fig . 5D ) but not myosin or formin activity 441 ( Fig . 5B and C ) . Indeed , the mechanism is based on a local gradient in extensile 442 versus contractile behavior around the evagination , so it should depend on 443 Arp2 / 3 ( which acts locally at the evagination ) and not on formin or myosin , 444 which would regulate overall contractility levels and not specifically local 445 gradients . Thus , our model suggests a chemo - mechanical signaling system that 446 autonomously restores homeostasis of membrane shape . 447 Discussion 448 Our work shows that stretch - compression cycles generate evaginations on the 449 apical PM of the cells with a size on the 100 nm scale , compatible with the 450 sensing range of IBAR proteins ( 47 , 51 ) . Further , we demonstrate the 451 recognition of this curved templates by the curvature - sensing protein IRSp53 . 452 The role of IRSp53 is not due to general cell - scale effects , such as lamellipodial 453 extension ( 44 , 57 ) or endocytosis . Indeed , cell spreading after the stretch - 454 compression cycle was not affected by IRSp53 ( Supp . Fig . 2 ) . Regarding 455 endocytosis , IRSp53 has been described to regulate the CLIC - GEEC endocytic 456 pathway ( 50 ) , which is in turn activated upon cell compression ( 18 ) . However , 457 the I268N - CRIB and 4KE - IBAR IRSp53 mutants strongly impaired endocytosis 458 ( 50 ) , but fully rescued evagination resorption ( Fig . 3F ) , showing that IRSp53 459 affects both phenomena through different mechanisms . Further supporting this 460 possibility , the resorption of low - curvature VLDs formed upon transient 461 exposure of cells to hypo - osmotic media , a treatment which also activates CLIC - 462 GEEC endocytosis ( 18 ) , was not affected by IRSp53 . 463 Thus , our findings demonstrate a novel mechanosensing mechanism : upon cell 464 compression , cells are known to use caveolae formation ( 22 ) and the CLIC - 465 GEEC endocytic pathway ( 18 ) to store material from the PM and recover resting 466 tension . On top of this , we demonstrate a new event at the local scale , which 467 restores PM shape perturbations induced by mechanical stimulation . This event 468 involves the progressive flattening of the PM and not its scission , which would 469 have involved an abrupt loss of evagination fluorescence ( and the appearance of 470 fluorescent membrane vesicles ) which we never observed in experiments . To 471 achieve such flattening , cells employ the IRSp53 - Rac1 - Arp2 / 3 network , well 472 11 described to polymerize actin in the context of lamellipodia extension or ruffling 473 ( 86 , 87 ) , and revisited here to describe its action in response to physical 474 perturbations . In this regard , we describe a novel mechanism , and biophysical 475 framework , in which Arp2 / 3 mediated actin polymerization can lead to 476 membrane flattening rather than protrusion . 477 While stretch is often studied separately from subsequent compression provoked 478 by its release ( 88 – 90 ) , here we put in relevance the coupling between the two at 479 the single cell level . Such coupling takes place for instance in heart beating , 480 breathing , the musculoskeletal system , or in many developmental scenarios . 481 Thus , and although this remains to be explored , our mechanism could be 482 relevant in events such as the fast compressions of cells embedded in connective 483 tissues ( 91 ) , or apical expansion and contractions of amnioserosa cells during 484 dorsal closure in Drosophila embryos ( 92 ) , among many others . In conclusion , 485 our findings reveal a new mechanosensing mechanism explaining how PM 486 detects physical stimuli at a local , sub - µm scale , and further coordinates a 487 response allowing for quick adaptation to a changing environment . 488 489 Materials and Methods 490 Cell culture , expression vectors and reagents 491 NHDF were purchased from Lonza ( CC - 2511 ) and cultured in DMEM without 492 pyruvate ( ThermoFisher 41965 - 039 ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( v / v ) , 1 % 493 penicillin - streptomycin ( v / v ) and 1 % Insulin - Transferrin - Selenium ( v / v ) 494 ( ThermoFisher 41400045 ) . IRSp53 - / - MEF infected with an empty pBABE or a 495 pBABE - IRSp53 - WT retroviral vector were generated by G . Scita ( IFOM , 496 Milan ) as previously described ( 52 – 54 ) , leading to a cell line that we 497 noteIRSp53 - / - R . The culture was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 1 % 498 penicillin - streptomycin ( v / v ) and 1 µ / mL puromycin to selectively maintain 499 cells expressing the selection vector . CO2 independent media ( ThermoFisher 500 18045088 ) was used for microscopy imaging and was supplemented with 501 10µg / mL of rutin ( Sigma R5143 ) to prevent photobleaching ( 93 ) . mCherry , 502 EGFP and EYFP membrane markers contained a fusion protein consisting in 503 one of the three fluorophores coupled to the 20 last amino acids of 504 Neuromodulin which is post - translationally palmitoylated and targets the 505 fluorophore to PM ( 20 ) . IRSp53 60950 shRNA and control Non - Targeting 506 shRNA were purchased from Sigma Mission for viral transfection and stable cell 507 line creation . mEmerald - Ezrin was from Addgene ( # 54090 ) . EGFP - IRSp53 - FL 508 ( 62 ) , EGFP - IRSp53 - 4KE , EGFP - IRSp53 - I268N ( 50 ) and EGFP - IRSp53 - I403P 509 ( 52 ) contained isoform 2 of the murine protein either wild type or carrying the 510 mentioned mutations in the pC1 - EGFP backbone . EGFP - IRSp53 - 511 W413G , EGFP - IRSp53 - ∆IBAR and EGFP - IBAR ( 52 ) where created based on 512 the sequence of isoform 4 of the human protein inserted in the pC1 - EGFP 513 backbone . A point mutation was included in the SH3 , the first 312 amino acids 514 were removed in the case of the ∆IBAR and the fir st 250 amino acids were 515 expressed to obtain the IBAR - domain . The dominant constitutively active Rac1 - 516 G12V and the dominant negative Rac1 - T17N were described previously ( 94 ) . 517 12 Actin was marked using the mammalian expression vector encoding the 518 cytoskeleton marker Actin - VHH fused to either or RFP or GFP2 and 519 commercially sold as Actin - Chromobody® ( Chromotek ) 520 On the day prior to the experiment , cells were transfected by electroporation 521 with the selected plasmids using the NeonTM Transfection System ( Invitrogene ) 522 following the protocol provided by the company . CK - 666 was purchased from 523 Merck ( Ref 182515 ) , SMIFH2 was from Abcam ( ab218296 ) , Wiskostatin was 524 bought from Sigma ( W2270 ) and Para - Nitro - Blebbistatin was from Optopharma 525 ( DR - N - 111 ) . All compounds were diluted in DMSO and conserved according to 526 manufacturer’s instructions . On the day of the experiment , drugs were diluted in 527 culture media , filtered through a 0 , 22 µm filter and warmed up to 37ºC prior to 528 addition to the culture . Cells were treated with 25 µM of CK - 666 for 30 min , 10 529 µM of PNB for 30 - 40 min and 10 µM Wiskostatin or 15 µM SMIFH for 1 h 530 prior to the experiment . 531 PDMS membrane fabrication 532 The stretchable PDMS membranes were prepared as described in ( 20 ) . To 533 produce a patterned support to further obtain patterned - PDMS membranes 534 PMMA dishes were plasma cleaned for 20 min and warmed up to 95ºC for 5 535 min . After cooling down using a nitrogen gun , SU 2010 resin was spinned on 536 top of the dish to create a 10 µm layer and prebaked 2 , 5 min at 95ºC . Dishes 537 were then placed on a mask aligner and exposed for 7 , 5 s in presence of the 538 designed acetate mask . After post - baking for 3 , 5 min at 95ºC , the pattern was 539 revealed for 1 min and subsequently extensively washed with isopropanol and 540 verified under the microscope . Finally , PMMA dishes were silanized by 30 s 541 plasma cleaning activation followed by 1 h silane treatment under vacuum . 542 Standard or patterned membranes were mounted on metal rings of our 543 customized stretch system , cleaned , sterilized , and coated with 10 µg / ml 544 fibronectin ( Sigma ) overnight at 4°C prior to experiments . Patterns were 545 designed as a grid with letters and numbers to allow for correct orientation . 546 Stretch and osmolarity experiments 547 After overnight fibronectin coating , PDMS membranes were quickly washed 548 and 3000 cells were seeded on top and allowed to spread for 45min to 1h in the 549 incubator . Then , rings were mounted on the stretch device coupled to the 550 microscope stage , vacuum was applied for 3 min to stretch the membrane , and 551 then vacuum was released to come back to the initial shape as described in ( 20 ) . 552 Calibration of the system was done to adjust the vacuum applied to obtain 5 % 553 stretch of the PDMS surface . Hypo - osmotic shocks were performed by exposing 554 cells during 3 min to CO2 independent medium mixed at 50 % with de - ionized 555 water in which the concentrations of Ca + 2 and Mg + 2 had been corrected . Iso - 556 osmotic medium was added after the 3 min incubation period . 557 Scanning electron microscopy experiments 558 Cells were prepared as explained in the previous section . Right after stretch 559 release , the sample was fixed in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde EM grade ( Electron 560 13 Microscopy Sciences 16220 ) plus 2 % PFA ( Electron Microscopy Sciences 561 15710 - S ) diluted in 0 . 1 M PB buffer at 37ºC for 1 h . Samples were then washed 562 4x for 10 min in 0 . 1 M Phosphate Buffer ( PB ) and imaged with epifluorescence 563 microscopy as described below to acquire fluorescence images of the cell PM . 564 PDMS membranes were then cut into 1x0 . 5 cm rectangles in which the pattern 565 was centered and placed on top of 12 mm coverslips for further processing . 566 Dehydration was carried out by soaking samples in increasing ethanol 567 concentrations ( 50 , 70 , 90 , 96 and 100 % ) . After this , samples were critical point 568 dried and covered with a thin layer of gold to be imaged . 569 Transmission electron microscopy experiments 570 Cells were fixed , washed and PDMS membranes were cut and mounted as for 571 SEM imaging . After this , samples were postfixed with 1 % OsO4 and 0 . 8 % 572 K 3 Fe ( CN ) 6 for 1 h at 4ºC in the dark . Next , dehydration in increasing ethanol 573 concentrations ( 50 , 70 , 90 , 96 and 100 % ) was done . Samples were then 574 embedded in increasing concentrations of Pelco® EPONATE 12TM resin 575 ( Pelco 18010 ) mixed with acetone . 1 : 3 infiltration was done for 1 h then 2 : 2 for 576 1h and finally 3 : 1 overnight . On the next day , embedding was continued with 577 EPON12 without catalyzer for 3x2 h washes and then overnight . Last , samples 578 were embedded in EPON12 plus catalyzer DMP - 30 ( Pelco 18010 ) for 2x3 h . To 579 finish , blocks were mounted and polymerized for 48 h at 60ºC . PDMS 580 membrane was next peeled off and ultrathin sections were cut and mounted on 581 grids for imaging . 582 APEX labelling for TEM imaging 583 Two days prior to the experiment , cells were co - transfected by electroporation 584 with mKate2 - P2A - APEX2 - csGBP ( Addgene # 108875 ) and EGFP - IRSp53 - FL 585 in a 3 : 1 ratio , using the Neon TM Transfection System ( Invitrogene ) following the 586 protocol provided by the company . Before seeding , cells were sorted for double 587 positive mKate and GFP fluorescence , excluding very high and very low 588 transfection levels . Cells were subsequently seeded and stretched in the same 589 conditions as explained in the stretch experiments section . Right after stretch 590 release , the sample was fixed in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde EM grade ( Electron 591 Microscopy Sciences 16220 ) diluted in 0 . 1 M Cacodylate buffer at 37ºC for 10 592 min , followed by incubation on ice for 50 min in presence of the fixative . All 593 subsequent steps were performed on ice . The sample was washed 3 times with 594 cold 0 . 1 M Cacodylate buffer , and next cut into 1x0 . 5 cm rectangles containing 595 the fixed cells . Cells were washed for 2 min with a fresh cold 1 mg / ml 3 , 3’ - 596 diaminobenzidine ( DAB ) ( tablets , Sigmafast , D4293 ) solution in 0 . 1 M 597 Cacodylate buffer . Cells were immediately incubated with a fresh cold 1 mg / ml 598 DAB solution in cold 0 . 1 M Cacodylate buffer supplemented with 5 , 88 mM 599 hydrogen peroxidase ( PERDROGEN™ 30 % H2O2 , 31642 , Sigma ) . The 600 samples were washed 3 times with cold 0 . 1 M Cacodylate buffer , and 601 subsequently incubated for 30 minutes with cold 1 % OsO4 . Dehydration , resin 602 embedding , and block mounting was done as described in the TEM experiments 603 section . 604 Image acquisition 605 14 Fluorescence images were acquired with Metamorph software using an upright 606 microscope ( Nikon eclipse Ni - U ) with a 60x water dipping objective ( NIR Apo 607 60X / WD 2 . 8 , Nikon ) and an Orca Flash 4 . 0 camera ( Hamamatsu ) . Fluorophore 608 emission was collected every 3s . Cells were imaged in a relaxed state and then 609 for 3 min at 5 % stretch , and for 3 min during the release of stretch . SEM images 610 were taken using the xTm Microscope Control software in a NOVA NanoSEM 611 230 microscope ( FEI Company ) under the high vacuum mode using ET and TL 612 detectors to acquire high and ultra - high resolution images of the cell surface . 613 TEM Samples were observed in a Jeol 1010 microscope ( Gatan , Japan ) 614 equipped with a tungsten cathode in the CCiTUB EM and Cryomicroscopy 615 Units . Images were acquired at 80 kv with a CCD Megaview 1kx1k . 616 Fluorescence analysis 617 All images used for time course analysis were aligned using the Template 618 Matching plugin from Fiji to correct the drift . To assess the evolution of PM 619 evaginations , VLDs or the different marked proteins , their fluorescence was 620 quantified . To ensure that we only considered the fluorescence of structures 621 induced by stretch or osmotic shocks , the analysis was carried out in regions 622 devoid of visible endomembrane structures before the application of stretch or 623 osmotic shocks . For each evagination , we calculated the integrated fluorescence 624 signal of a small region of interest containing the evagination ( I evag ) , the 625 integrated fluorescence signal of a neighboring region of interest of the same 626 size and devoid of any structures ( I PM ) , the integrated fluorescence signal of the 627 entire cell ( I cell ) and the integrated fluorescence signal of a background region of 628 the same size as the cell ( I BG ) . Then , the final evagination signal I final was 629 computed as : 630 𝐼𝐼 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 = ( 𝐼𝐼 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑒 − 𝐼𝐼 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 ) ( 𝐼𝐼 𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 − 𝐼𝐼 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 ) 631 The numerator of this expression corrects evagination fluorescence so that only 632 the signal coming from the evagination itself and not neighboring PM is 633 quantified . The denominator normalizes by total cell fluorescence , and also 634 accounts for progressive photobleaching . All control curves were normalized to 635 1 ( maximal fluorescence after stretch release ) and the rest of the data 636 represented in the same graph were normalized to the control . Exceptionally , 637 actin and ezrin curves were normalized to 0 . 5 ( maximal fluorescence after the 638 release of stretch ) for visualization purposes . To quantify the degree of 639 resorption of the evaginations , as the experimental data could not always be 640 fitted with single exponential decay curve , we adopted the strategy of comparing 641 the residual fluorescence intensity of the PM marker at the las timepoint of 642 acquisition ( t180s ) , on which statistical analysis can be performed . Full 643 reabsorption of evaginations leads to a complete return to fluorescent baseline 644 ( ≈0 ) , while presence of a residual fluorescence indicates non - reabsorbed 645 evaginations . Lag time was calculated by identifying the maximum intensity 646 timepoints in the protein and PM channels , and subtracting them to obtain the 647 time between the two events . 648 Area analysis 649 15 To compute the changes in cell area with time after stretch , automated area 650 analysis for each timepoint was done using CellProfiler ( 95 ) 651 ( https : / / cellprofiler . org / ) . To calculate the time constant ( k ) of each experimental 652 curve , data was fitted to a one - phase decay ( for time course dynamics of PM 653 evaginations , VLDs and protein markers ) or one - phase association equation 654 ( area analysis after stretch ) using GraphPad and k was extracted from the fittings 655 to be further compared by statistical analysis . 656 Quantification of number and PM Area % stored by evaginations 657 3 regions of different parts of the cell where randomly chosen from every cell at 658 the timepoint t0s ( right after the release of stretch ) and the number of 659 evaginations was manually counted by comparing the analyzed images with the 660 images of the cell during stretch , to discard PM structures not formed by stretch - 661 release . For stored area calculation , the membrane area fraction mf contained in 662 evaginations was estimated as : 663 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = 𝑖𝑖 𝑧𝑧𝑒𝑒 − 𝑖𝑖 𝑧𝑧𝑓𝑓 𝑖𝑖 𝑧𝑧𝑓𝑓 − 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 664 Where i ze is the average fluorescence intensity of a cell zone ( containing 665 evaginations ) , i zf is the average fluorescence intensity of a neighbouring flat 666 patch of membrane ( small enough so that it does not contain any evaginations ) , 667 and bg is the average intensity of background . For each cell , this was done for 3 668 random regions containing evaginations . 669 Fluorescence and SEM correlation 670 Images of the fixed sample were acquired in fluorescence and brightfield and 671 positions of the imaged cells in the pattern were noted down . Sample was then 672 processed for SEM imaging and the same cells were found by manually 673 following their location on the pattern and visual verification was done to check 674 for correct matching . Fluorescent and SEM images were then aligned by using 675 the BigWrap plugin on Fiji . 676 Statistical analysis 677 In the case of data following a normal distribution , T - test or ANOVA was done 678 depending on whether there were 2 or more datasets to compare . For data not 679 following normal distributions , Mann - Whitney or Kruskal - Wallis test were 680 applied depending on whether there were 2 or more datasets to test . All data are 681 shown as mean ± SEM . Specific P and N values can be found in each one of the 682 graphs shown in the figures . 683 Theoretical Model 684 To understand the physical mechanism leading to the active flattening of 685 membrane evaginations caused by compression of the PM , we focused on a 686 single evagination and described it mathematically under the assumption of 687 axisymmetry . We modelled the membrane as locally inextensible thin sheet with 688 16 bending rigidity 𝜅𝜅 = 20 𝑘𝑘 𝐵𝐵 𝑇𝑇 using the Helfrich model and accounted for the 689 viscous stresses due to membrane shearing with membrane 2D viscosity 𝜂𝜂 𝑚𝑚 = 690 3 ⋅ 10 −3 pN s / μ m ( 28 , 30 , 96 ) . We modelled the cortex as a 2D planar active 691 gel adjacent to the membrane . We thus ignored the out - of - plane protrusive 692 forces caused by localized actin polymerization at evaginations enriched in 693 IRSp53 , which in a classical view can lead to further protrusion rather than 694 flattening ( 55 ) . Instead , we focused on the in - plane effect of localized actin 695 polymerization to explain active flattening . In the actual system , we expect both 696 effects to compete . 697 To model the interaction between the membrane and the cortex , we considered 698 an adhesion potential depending on the distance between the membrane and the 699 cortex enabling decohesion with an adhesion tension of 𝛾𝛾 = 1 . 5 ⋅ 10 −5 N / m 700 ( 30 ) , ( Supp . Fig . 6 ) . We also considered in - plane frictional tractions between the 701 membrane and the cortex proportional to their relative velocity , 𝜏𝜏 = 𝜇𝜇 ( 𝑣𝑣 𝑚𝑚 − 𝑣𝑣 𝑐𝑐 ) 702 where 𝑣𝑣 𝑚𝑚 is the membrane velocity , 𝑣𝑣 𝑐𝑐 is the cortex velocity , and 𝜇𝜇 is a friction 703 coefficient , which we took as 𝜇𝜇 = 20 nN s / µ m 3 ( 28 ) . 704 We generated evaginations with dimensions comparable to those in ( Fig . 1 ) by 705 laterally compressing an adhered membrane patch of radius 𝑅𝑅 0 as discussed in 706 ( 30 ) . We considered 𝑅𝑅 0 = 150 nm , consistent with the typical separation 707 between evaginations ( Fig . 1C ) . After formation of the evagination , we applied 708 at the boundary of our computational domain the surface tension required to 709 stabilize the evagination , consistent with the long - time stability of such 710 compression - generated evaginations of the PM when cellular activity is 711 abrogated ( 20 ) . 712 We then considered the model in ( 83 ) to capture the interaction between an 713 ensemble of curved proteins ( IRSp53 ) and a membrane . In this model , proteins 714 are described by their area fraction 𝜙𝜙 . We fixed the chemical potential of such 715 proteins at the boundary of our computational domain , corresponding to a 716 relatively low area fraction of proteins , 𝜙𝜙� = 0 . 05 . We set the saturation 717 coverage to 𝜙𝜙 max = 0 . 35 due to crowding by other species but in our 718 calculations , coverage did not come close to this limit . We considered an 719 effective surface area per dimer of 300 nm 2 . In this model , the curvature energy 720 density of the membrane - protein system is given by 𝜅𝜅 2 ( 𝐻𝐻 − 𝐶𝐶 0 𝜙𝜙 ) where H is the 721 mean curvature and 𝐶𝐶 0 is a parameter combining the intrinsic curvature of 722 proteins and their stiffness ( 83 ) . We took 𝐶𝐶 0 = 3 ⋅ 10 −3 nm - 1 , which lead to 723 curvature sensing but no significant protein - induced membrane reshaping . With 724 a protein diffusivity of 0 . 1 µ m 2 / s , we obtained protein enrichments on the 725 evagination of about 3 - fold within 0 . 5 s . 726 To model in a coarse grained manner the signalling pathway triggered by 727 IRSp53 localization and leading to actin polymerization , we considered a 728 regulator species given by a normalized surface density 𝜓𝜓 , which was produced 729 with a rate depending on IRSp53 enrichment and given by 𝑟𝑟 � 𝜙𝜙 𝜙𝜙� � = 730 𝑘𝑘 1 min �⟨ 𝜙𝜙 𝜙𝜙� − 𝑒𝑒 𝑡𝑡 ⟩ ; 𝑒𝑒 𝑠𝑠 − 𝑒𝑒 𝑡𝑡 � , where 𝑒𝑒 𝑡𝑡 is a threshold IRSp53 enrichment for 731 signaling , 𝑒𝑒 𝑠𝑠 is an enrichment saturation threshold beyond which the production 732 17 of 𝛹𝛹 saturates , and ⟨𝑎𝑎⟩ is 0 if 𝑎𝑎 < 0 and a otherwise . We considered 𝑒𝑒 𝑡𝑡 = 2 , 733 𝑒𝑒 𝑠𝑠 = 3 and 𝑘𝑘 1 = 1 s - 1 . This regulator was degraded with rate 𝑘𝑘 2 𝜓𝜓 , with 𝑘𝑘 2 = 1 734 s - 1 and diffused with an effective diffusivity of 𝐷𝐷 = 0 . 1 ⋅ 10 −3 µ m 2 / s , much 735 smaller than that of membrane proteins since the regulator is viewed as an actin - 736 binding species . In polar coordinates , the governing equation for the transport of 737 this regulator is thus 738 ∂𝜓𝜓 ∂𝑡𝑡 = 1 𝑟𝑟 ∂ ∂ r �𝑟𝑟𝐷𝐷 ∂𝜓𝜓 ∂𝑟𝑟 � + 𝑟𝑟 ( 𝜙𝜙 / 𝜙𝜙� ) − 𝑘𝑘 2 𝜓𝜓 739 This equation results in a region enriched with 𝜓𝜓 , co - localizing with the 740 evagination , and reaching a maximum value of about 1 within about 10 s , 741 comparable to the typical times of actin dynamics . Not being a detailed 742 description of a specific network , the details of this model for 𝜓𝜓 are not 743 essential . The key points are that the production of 𝜓𝜓 is triggered by IRSp53 744 enrichment , and that 𝑘𝑘 1 , 𝑘𝑘 2 and 𝐷𝐷 are such that over the time - scales of actin 745 dynamics ( significantly slower than those of IRSp53 enrichment ) a region of 746 high 𝜓𝜓 develops close to the evagination . 747 The effect of this regulator is to locally favour actin polymerization by the 748 Arp2 / 3 complex . The cortex can be viewed as a composite system of 749 interpenetrating actin networks , one polymerized by formins leading to linear 750 filaments and producing contractile forces through the action of myosins and 751 other crosslinkers , and one polymerized by the Arp2 / 3 complex , with a branched 752 architecture and producing extensile forces by polymerization ( 84 ) . Combining 753 these two effects , the net active force generation in the actin cortex is contractile . 754 These two networks compete for actin monomers ( 85 ) , and hence a local 755 enrichment in the regulator leading to enhanced polymerization of the branched 756 network should bias this competition and locally lower contractility in the 757 vicinity of the evagination . In turn , the resulting contractility gradient should 758 generate an in - plane centrifugal cortical flow , which if large enough , might drag 759 the membrane outwards due to frictional forces and actively flatten the 760 evagination . 761 To model such actin flow , we considered simple active gel model where the 762 cortical velocity υ c is obtained by force balance between viscous and active 763 forces in the cortex , and given by 764 0 = 2 𝜂𝜂 𝑐𝑐 �− 1 𝑟𝑟 ∂ ∂𝑟𝑟 �𝑟𝑟 ∂𝑣𝑣 𝑐𝑐 ∂𝑟𝑟 �� + ∂𝜎𝜎 a ∂𝑟𝑟 765 where η c is the viscosity of the cortex and 𝜎𝜎 𝑓𝑓 ( 𝜓𝜓 ) is the active tension , which we 766 assume to be a function of the regulator ψ . We note that we neglect in the 767 equation above the force caused by friction between the membrane and the 768 cortex as they slip past each other . This is justified because the hydrodynamic 769 length for the cortex is in the order of microns and above , and hence in the 770 smaller length - scales considered here viscosity dominates over friction . In our 771 calculations , we took 𝜎𝜎 𝑓𝑓 ( 𝜓𝜓 ) = 𝜎𝜎 0 ( 1 − 𝜓𝜓 2 ) , so that active tension is 772 approximately halved near the evagination when the normalized regulator 773 18 density 𝜓𝜓 reaches about 1 and is equal to 𝜎𝜎 0 far away from it . As boundary 774 conditions , we considered 𝑣𝑣 𝑐𝑐 ( 0 ) = 0 consistent with polar symmetry and 775 ∂𝑒𝑒 𝑐𝑐 ∂𝑟𝑟 ( 𝑅𝑅 ) = 0 , so that at 𝑟𝑟 = 𝑅𝑅 the stress at the gel is 𝜎𝜎 0 . We chose 𝜎𝜎 0 / 𝜂𝜂 𝑐𝑐 so that 776 the resulting cortical velocities due to gradients in active tension gradients were 777 of about 0 . 1 µ m / s , comparable to the typical actin velocities due to 778 polymerization in the lamellipodium ( 97 ) . 779 The formation of the evagination triggered in this model a sequence of chemo - 780 mechanical signaling event restoring autonomously homeostasis of membrane 781 shape and of all the signaling network . Indeed , within a few seconds , IRSp53 782 became enriched in the evagination by curvature sensing . Then , over a about 10 783 seconds , the actin regulator 𝜓𝜓 progressively built up in the vicinity of the 784 evagination , creating a gradient in active tension σ , which in turn created a 785 centrifugal cortical flow . This flow frictionally dragged the membrane outward 786 ironing out the evagination . In the absence of curvature , the IRSp53 domain 787 rapidly dissolved and according to Eq . ( 1 ) 𝜓𝜓 dropped to zero everywhere , 788 eventually stopping the cortical flow and thus recovering a homeostatic state 789 with a planar membrane and a quiescent cortex . 790 We note that our model is consistent with the fact that myosin inhibition does 791 not affect the resorption process . Indeed , myosin inhibition should lower the 792 baseline active tension , 𝜎𝜎 0 , but should not change the fact that localized 793 polymerization would locally induce and extensile stress , and hence establish a 794 tension gradient and an actin flow . 795 One important difference between our model and the experiments is that , in our 796 calculations , the evaginations rapidly flattened once the contact angle of the 797 evagination became smaller than 90 degrees , whereas in the experiments , the 798 decay of membrane fluorescence was more gradual over a timescale of 3 799 minutes . We hypothesize that this may be due to the fact that localized actin 800 polymerization may fill the evagination with branched actin network , which 801 should apply an out - of - plane force competing with the flattening force causing 802 the centrifugal flow and whose material needs to be cleared out even when 803 localized polymerization has stopped . Both of these effects should slow down 804 the resorption process . 805 806 References 807 808 1 . G . Apodaca , Modulation of membrane traffic by mechanical stimuli . Am . J . 809 Physiol .
