Neuroimaging literature using resting - state functional connectivity ( RSFC ) has revealed network reorganizations during divergent thinking . Recent studies have revealed the changes of network organizations when performing creativity tasks , but such brain reconﬁgurations may be prolonged after task and be modulated by the trait of creativity . To investigate the dynamic reconﬁguration , 40 young participants were recruited to perform consecutive Alternative Uses Tasks ( AUTs ) for divergent thinking and two resting - state scans ( before and after AUT ) were used for mapping the brain reorganizations after AUT . We split participants into high - and low - creative groups based on creative achievement questionnaire ( CAQ ) and targeted on reconﬁgurations of the two brain networks : ( 1 ) default - mode network ( DMN ) and ( 2 ) the network seeded at the left inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG ) because the between - group difference of AUT - induced brain activation located at the left IFG . The changes of post - AUT RSFCs ( DMN and IFGN ) indicated the prolonged effect of divergent thinking . More speciﬁcally , the alterations of RSFC IFG − AG and RSFC IFG − IPL ( AG : angular gyrus , IPG : inferior parietal lobule ) in the high - creative group had positive relationship with their AUT performances ( originality and ﬂuency ) , but not found in the low - creative group . Furthermore , the RSFC changes of DMN did not present signiﬁcant relationships with AUT performances . The ﬁndings not only conﬁrmed the possibility of brain dynamic reconﬁguration following divergent thinking , but also suggested the distinct IFGN reconﬁguration between individuals with different creativity levels .

Brain Reconﬁgurations After Divergent Thinking INTRODUCTION Creativity is the foundation of originality , the generation of novel ideas when facing a speciﬁc problem ( Sternberg , 1999 ; Runco and Jaeger , 2012 ) , and the cornerstone of productivity in human civilization and modern society . However , despite the current surging importance of creativity , its manifestations in the brain involves a complex architecture , the underlying mechanisms of which require an extensive investigation to disentangle ( Sternberg and Lubart , 1996 ) . The current psychometric creativity measures are largely based on Guilford’s theory , according to which creative people have high ideational ﬂuency and high degrees of novelty ( Guilford , 1967 ) . To date , the understanding of the internal process of creativity tended to alternate between the generation of novel ideas ( i . e . , divergent thinking ) and the evaluation of generated ideas ( i . e . , convergent thinking ) . In the dual - process conception of creativity ( Abraham , 2013 ; Sowden et al . , 2015 ) , divergent thinking represents the acquisition of a certain task and diverts attention away from the task itself , in a highly spontaneous manner to generate ideas , whereas the convergent thinking is associated with deliberate constraints and the veriﬁcation of illuminated ideas ( Christoﬀ et al . , 2016 ) . Therefore , the divergent thinking can be regarded as an imperative incubation step before the “eureka ! ” moment reaches the mind . More importantly , the divergent thinking ability has moderate potential to predict creative achievements in the real world ( Plucker , 1999 ) . Based on the operational deﬁnitions of creativity , scientiﬁc disciplines have endeavored to unveil the sophisticated and fascinating mental processes of divergent thinking in the human brain . In the neuroscience of creativity , questionnaires and cognitive tasks , such as creative achievement questionnaire ( CAQ ) for individual creativity achievements and alternative uses task ( AUT ) or the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking ( TTCT ) for divergent thinking , were developed to probe the underlying mental processes of creativity ( Plucker , 1999 ; Sternberg , 1999 ; Carson et al . , 2005 ) . With the support of neuroimaging technologies , the neural substrates of divergent thinking have been progressively disclosed in the literature , although with great diversity across brain regions . For example , Jung et al . discovered that the CAQ was positively correlated with the left lateral orbitofrontal volume and the cortical thickness of the right angular gyrus ( Jung et al . , 2010 ) . Ellamil et al . demonstrated the involvement of the medial temporal lobe in a creative drawing generation task ( Ellamil et al . , 2012 ) . Using the AUT , Fink et al . demonstrated that originality was positively associated with the activation of the temporal - parietal junction , medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) and posterior cingulate cortex ( PCC ) ( Fink et al . , 2010 ) . Benedek et al . concluded that the left inferior parietal cortex and left prefrontal regions subserved the ﬂexible integration of previous knowledge for constructing novel and creative ideas ( Benedek et al . , 2014 ) . Abraham et al . demonstrated that the left inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG ) and temporal poles played major roles in AUT engagements ( Abraham et al . , 2012 ) . Moreover , a meta - analysis study revealed that the left IFG was among the most predominantly activated regions associated with idea generation across task - induced brain regions ( Gonen - Yaacovi et al . , 2013 ) , suggesting its functional role in the semantic processing and conceptual expansion to expand the acquired concept into novel elements ( Ward , 1994 ; Abraham , 2014 ; Boccia et al . , 2015 ) . In sum , emerging evidence indicates that brain regions in the left IFG , mPFC , parietal lobe , and medial temporal lobe are potentially involved in the mental process of divergent thinking . Beyond the perspective of creative - task induction , divergent thinking can be taken as a spontaneous - thought process for idea incubation because of its involvement in the dynamic shifts between memory , emotion and attention ( Sowden et al . , 2015 ; Christoﬀ et al . , 2016 ) . Therefore , a growing body of creativity - related neuroimaging studies , targeting the mental process of divergent thinking , have moved toward uncovering the long - distance brain connections using resting - state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rs - fMRI ) ( Takeuchi et al . , 2012 ; Beaty et al . , 2014 ; Wei et al . , 2014 ) . The default - mode network ( DMN ) has been determined to play an active role in idea generation , and the executive network appears to support idea evaluation instead ( Jung et al . , 2013 ; Beaty et al . , 2016 ; Shi et al . , 2018 ) . Interestingly , the involvements of DMN connectivity in divergent thinking accords with the ﬁndings concerning task engagements , except for the left IFG . By separating participants into high - and low - creative groups based on their creativity score , Beaty et al . revealed greater connectivity strengths between the left IFG and posterior DMN in the high - creative group in contrast to the low - creative group ( Beaty et al . , 2014 ) , which implies that the creative abilities lead to the variability of brain functionality . Recently , the DMN was further identiﬁed as a member of high - creativity neural circuits using connectome - based predictive modeling and AUT - based fMRI datasets ( Beaty et al . , 2018 ) . The same study also inferred the plausible dynamicity of the network organization after divergent thinking by revealing the higher predictive power of a high - creativity network on the creativity score during AUT , compared with that under normal resting conditions . Wei et al . further suggested the possibility of dynamic resting - state functional connectivity ( RSFC ) changes by demonstrating that the low - creative group exhibited stronger RSFC changes between the mPFC and the middle temporal gyrus ( MTG ) after a creativity - related training task ( Wei et al . , 2014 ) . Given the dynamic nature of creative thinking , it is speculated that the integrity of creativity - associated brain networks changes dynamically following the divergent thinking . However , are the dynamic network reconﬁguration associated with the creativity performance ? Do diﬀerent creativity levels lead to distinct RSFC alterations ? These unanswered questions are further addressed to better understand the brain functionality underlying creativity . Herein , we establish the following hypotheses : ( 1 ) AUT - induced RSFC changes are associated with the creativity performances , and ( 2 ) individuals with diﬀerent levels of creativity use distinct strategy of brain reconﬁgurations to comply with the challenges of AUT . To test these hypotheses , we recruited forty young participants to perform AUTs and compared their RSFC maps between two rs - fMRI sessions ( Pre - and Post - AUT ) . The levels of creativity were assessed through splitting the participants into two groups ( high - and Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 2 November 2020 | Volume 14 | Article 571118 Wu et al . Brain Reconﬁgurations After Divergent Thinking low - creative ) based on the CAQ scores and we tested the inﬂuence of AUT on RSFC changes for each creativity group . MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants A total of 42 right - handed healthy young adults were recruited in this study . The inclusion criteria were as follows : ( a ) non - smoking and without drug addiction ; ( b ) not pregnant ; ( c ) no history of neurological and psychiatric disorder history , and ( d ) no metal body implants . The entire protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of National Taiwan University ( NTU - REC No . 201407EM028 ) . Because two participants could not complete the entire experimental procedure , their datasets were excluded in the analysis . Accordingly , the following results are reported for the remaining 40 participants ( 19 males , mean age = 24 . 4 ± 2 . 8 years , range : 21 – 33 years ) . Stimuli of AUT The stimuli consisted of 56 grayscale images of objects from daily life with background removed . Prior to the actual fMRI experiment , we rated the number of alternative usages for each object stimulus from a separate group of participants ( N = 15 , 12 males , mean age = 23 . 4 ± 3 years , range : 20 – 30 years ) . During the rating , the 56 objects were presented consecutively to the participants with inter - trial intervals ( ITIs ) of 26 s . The participants were instructed to think and express alternative usages for each object within 20 s . The mean number of answer for each object was 2 . 4 . We categorized the diﬃculty of AUT into three levels as follows : normal , 1 . 99 – 2 . 99 answers per picture ; diﬃcult , < 1 . 99 answers per picture ; and easy , > 2 . 99 answers per picture . Subsequently , we used the task materials to design the AUT in MRI environments . All of the objects were presented against a white background for both rating and fMRI experiment . Experimental Procedure After consenting , the participants were instructed to complete a CAQ , containing eight aspects of creativity ( Carson et al . , 2005 ) , and to undergo the fMRI experiments . The fMRI experiment included seven sessions in total : two resting - state , two 0 - back and three AUT sessions . The participants underwent the ﬁrst rs - fMRI scan ( Pre - AUT ) , performed three consecutive AUTs with two 0 - back tasks in between , and went through the second rs - fMRI scan ( Post - AUT ) at the end . The participants only received the instruction to generate novel ideas after viewing pictures in the AUT sessions without practices to ensure the Pre - AUT resting state was irrelevant to divergent thinking . The multiple AUTs were designed to enhance the divergent thinking process with undemanding tasks ( 0 - back ) in between ( Baird et al . , 2012 ) . Herein , we considered all AUTs and 0 - backs as instructed divergent - thinking engagements , and adopted the two sessions of resting - state scans ( Pre - AUT and Post - AUT ) to discern the alterations of RSFC through the divergent thinking process . fMRI Acquisition and Scanning Parameters MRI experiments were conducted by a 3T MRI scanner ( Prisma , Siemens , Erlangen , Germany ) with 20 - channel head coil at National Taiwan University . During the experiment , a high - resolution T1 - weighted anatomical image was initially scanned using the 3D - MPRAGE sequence with 256 × 256 × 192 matrix size ; 0 . 93 × 0 . 93 × 0 . 93 mm 3 resolution ; inversion time ( TI ) = 900 ms ; repetition time ( TR ) = 2 , 000 ms , echo time ( TE ) = 2 . 3 ms ; ﬂip angle ( FA ) = 8 ◦ ; bandwidth = 200 Hz / pixel ; NEX = 1 . Total scan time was 6 min 14 sec . The fMRI protocol was using a single - shot gradient - echo echo - planar imaging ( GE - EPI ) sequence with following imaging parameters : TR = 2 s , TE = 34 ms , FA = 84 ◦ , bandwidth = 3 , 005 Hz / pixel , matrix size = 64 × 64 × 33 , and FOV = 210 × 210 mm 2 . Stimuli were presented via E - prime 2 . 0 ( Psychology Software Tools , Pittsburgh , PA , USA ) with a back - projection projector in 800 × 600 resolution . Participants viewed the stimuli using a mirror mounted on the head - coil and the viewing ﬁeld was 8 . 4 ◦ ( horizontal ) by 6 . 3 ◦ ( vertical ) at a viewing distance of 420 cm . Participants were instructed to respond with a button press using the index and middle ﬁngers of their right hand ( Lumina response pad ; Cedrus , San Pedro , CA , USA ) . During the rs - fMRI scans , the participants were instructed to stay still with their eyes open , to not fall into sleep and to not think of anything in particular . The rs - fMRI scan contained 180 measurements ( 6 min ) per session . During the AUTs , the participants were instructed to view gray - scale pictures of various objects from daily life ( through a projector ) , and to think of as many alternative usages as possible within a ﬁxed duration ( 20 s ) . Each AUT session contained 12 trials , including one easy - level picture , one diﬃcult - level picture , and ten normal - level pictures to balance the diﬃculty level , with ﬁxation and cues of 6 s in between ; within each trial one single picture was presented for 20 sec . During the 20 s of the picture presentation , the participants were instructed to press the button immediately when they thought of a special usage ; and the button - press numbers and the response time were recorded . Each AUT task contained 156 scans ( 5 min 12 s ) in total . After the cessation of each AUT , the participants were asked to recall the answers retrospectively , and the answers were manually recorded by the experimenter . During the 0 - back tasks , one English letter was displayed on screen for 0 . 5 s , followed by a cross ﬁxation for 1 . 5 s . The participants were instructed to respond using their right hand to press the right button when the letter appearing on the screen was “X” ; otherwise , they were to press the left button . The 0 - back fMRI contained 152 scans ( 5 min 4 s ) in each session . The datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author . AUT Performance Beyond the creativity assessment obtained through the CAQ , the two creativity indices of AUT ( e . g . , originality and ﬂuency ) were also evaluated for each participant according to the scoring method of previous studies ( Hao et al . , 2015 ) . Fluency was estimated on the basis of the total number of ideas given during the AUT trials . Originality was estimated on the basis of statistically infrequent responses using the following means . The generated answers from the AUT were collected into a comprehensive lexicon for comparison . Three trained raters independently assessed the originality of the AUT performance Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 3 November 2020 | Volume 14 | Article 571118 Wu et al . Brain Reconﬁgurations After Divergent Thinking for every participant . If 10 % or less of the participants in the sample gave the same response then it was given a score of “1 , ” and all other responses received scores of “0 . ” The inter - rater agreement was with intra - class correlation coeﬃcient of 0 . 97 . Subsequently , the originality scores of the AUT performance assigned by the three raters were averaged for every participant . fMRI Analyses The data were processed using Analysis of Functional Neuro Images ( AFNI ) ( Cox , 1996 ) . We processed the task data according to the following steps : ( a ) motion correction ; ( b ) coregistration ; ( c ) smoothing with full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) = 6 mm , and ( d ) normalization to the MNI space . During the AUT sessions , participants’ responses were recorded and used as the events for divergent thinking , enabling the event - related fMRI analysis . Using the events convolved with the canonical hemodynamic function , we subsequently applied the generalized linear model ( GLM ) to generate the activation map for each AUT and calculated the average beta map across three AUTs for each individual . The consequent AUT results were equally divided into two groups ( n = 20 for each of the high - and low - creative groups ) according to their CAQ scores ( the cut - oﬀ score for the CAQ was 8 ) , and a two - sample t - test was conducted to generate the contrast maps of AUT brain activity . The rs - fMRI data were processed according to the following steps : ( a ) ﬁeld - map correction ; ( b ) motion correction ; ( c ) coregistration ; ( d ) detrending and ﬁltering ( 0 ∼ 0 . 1 Hz ) ; ( e ) smoothing with FWHM = 5 mm , and ( f ) normalization ; and ( g ) the physiological noise removal including white matter , cerebrospinal ﬂuid and six motion parameters . Subsequently , the functional connectivity maps before and after AUT were established through the seed - correlation analysis , targeting on two speciﬁc brain networks : ( 1 ) the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex ( PCC ) [ ± 3 , − 53 , 26 ] for assessing DMN ( Van Dijk et al . , 2010 ; Yan et al . , 2013 ) , and ( 2 ) the seeding at the peak of AUT contrasts between the high - and low - creative groups . Subsequently , the group - based RSFC maps underwent the following statistical analyses to estimate the brain reconﬁgurations . Statistical Analyses All group analyses of the fMRI results were conducted on the basis of analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and t - test using AFNI . The group diﬀerence in brain activity during AUTs were evaluated through a two - sample t - test between the high - and low - creative groups . The two brain networks associated with divergent thinking were compared for RSFC according to the 2 ( high - and low - creative ) × 2 ( pre - and post - AUT ) two - way ANOVA ( 3dMVM ) , inclusive of the mean framewise displacement to minimize the motion eﬀect on RSFC ﬁndings . The multiple comparisons in the group analysis were corrected through the 3dClustSim approach with the auto - correlation function and the signiﬁcance level was p < 0 . 05 ( uncorrected p < 0 . 001 , cluster size = 80 mm 3 ) . To further determine the relationships between creativity scores and the divergent thinking eﬀect of RSFC , the Pearson correlation analysis was used to measure the association between the behavior indices of each individual ( originality and ﬂuency ) and the RSFC changes ( Post - Pre ) from selected regions of interested ( ROIs ) . The centers of the spherical ROIs ( radius = 5 mm ) were placed at the peak value of the signiﬁcant changes in the contrast maps . The eﬀect of divergent thinking was assessed by calculating the RSFC diﬀerences between Pre - and Post - AUT after Fisher’s z transformation of the correlation coeﬃcients . The z - transformed RSFC changes from the selected ROIs were correlated with the creativity indices ( originality and ﬂuency ) with false - discovery rate ( FDR ) correction across ROI - wise comparisons . The statistical calculations were performed using SPSS 20 ( IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences ) . RESULTS Creativity Performances : CAQ and AUT The average CAQ score for the 40 participants was 10 . 8 ± 10 . 4 , ranging from 1 to 62 . Regarding the overall AUT performances , the evaluated originality and ﬂuency were 0 . 33 ± 0 . 11 and 3 . 1 ± 1 . 0 , respectively . The CAQ scores were adjusted by the log - transform ( Form and Kaernbach , 2018 ) , and the log ( CAQ ) scores exhibited a positive trend toward the AUT ﬂuency ( r = 0 . 30 , p = 0 . 06 ) , without prominent relationships with originality ( r = 0 . 22 , p = 0 . 16 ) for all participants . To test the diﬀerence in brain activity between high and low creativity individuals , the following results were divided into two groups with equal sample size ( n = 20 for each group ) ; where their CAQ scores were 16 . 6 ± 12 . 2 for the high - creative group and 5 . 0 ± 1 . 9 for the low - creative group . In addition , the two groups showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in age ( p = 0 . 06 ) , gender ( p = 0 . 53 ) and motion during the two rs - fMRI scans ( framewise displacement : p = 0 . 39 ) . Brain Activity Associated With AUT The AUT - associated brain activations were located at the left superior temporal gyrus , anterior cingulate gyrus , declive of the cerebellum , caudate and occipital visual cortex ( Figure 1 , corrected p < 0 . 01 ) . Figures 1A , B illustrate the average activation maps of AUT for the high - creative and low - creative groups , respectively , where the high - creative group exhibited relatively broad spatial extents in AUT engagements relatively . Negative activations were found lateralized to the right hemisphere , speciﬁcally located at the right PCC and right inferior parietal lobule . Figure 1C depicts the contrast between the two groups by independent t - test ( corrected p < 0 . 05 ) . A diﬀerence between the groups was observed only in the left IFG ( BA47 , [ − 32 , 24 , − 14 ] ) , which was taken as the seed localization for the subsequent RSFC analyses . Supplementary Figure 1 shows the overall AUT activation map across all participants and Supplementary Table 1 lists the detailed description of AUT - related brain activities . Functional Connectivity : IFGN and DMN To further elucidate the alterations of brain integrity over the divergent thinking process , we applied a seed - correlation approach to investigate RSFC . Two brain networks were targeted with the seed locations in bilateral PCC for DMN and left IFG for IFG - associated network ( IFGN ) to assess the group Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 4 November 2020 | Volume 14 | Article 571118 Wu et al .

We presented the activation maps divided into two groups as follows : high - and low - creative [ ( A , B ) , respectively , segregated by CAQ scores ] .

The upper panel of Figure 2 illustrates the DMN connectivity maps exhibiting strong connections to the bilateral medial and middle frontal , PCC , and bilateral angular gyrus ( corrected p < 0 . 01 ) . The lower panel of Figure 2 illustrates the IFGN connectivity maps ( corrected p < 0 . 01 ) . The IFGN was associated with the bilateral superior frontal , medial frontal , anterior cingulate , insula , superior , and middle temporal gyri . The detailed information of the group × divergent thinking comparisons ( high - creative , low - creative , Pre - AUT and Post - AUT ) for IFGN and DMN is listed in Table 1 . Prior to the AUT engagements ( Pre - AUT ) , the only signiﬁcant diﬀerence in IFGN between the groups was in the right angular gyrus ( AG ) and right inferior parietal lobule ( IPL ) , but no group diﬀerence was observed in DMN at the baseline level . However , the RSFC of both networks changed after performing the AUT . Table 1 demonstrates that the group diﬀerence of RSFC DMN became prominent after AUT engagements , and the RSFC IFGN showed diﬀerent network reconﬁgurations between the two groups . Association Between Functional Connectivity and Creativity Scores An ROI analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between RSFC changes and creativity scores . The spherical ROIs were placed according to the results in Table 1 . Figure 3 presents the RSFC changes between Pre - AUT and Post - AUT and their relationships with AUT originality and ﬂuency in both groups . The RSFC changes in IFGN at the right AG and right IPL were positively correlated with the AUT performances : originality and ﬂuency ( originality - 1 FC IFG − AG : r = 0 . 51 , p < 0 . 02 ; ﬂuency - 1 FC IFG − AG : r = 0 . 49 , p < 0 . 03 ; originality - 1 FC IFG − IPL : r = 0 . 63 , p < 0 . 001 ) in the high - creative group , but the correlations in the low - creative group were non - signiﬁcant . The Steiger’s Z - test presented signiﬁcant group diﬀerences in the correlation coeﬃcients of originality - 1 FC IFG − AG ( p < 0 . 001 ) , ﬂuency - 1 FC IFG − AG ( p < 0 . 004 ) and originality - 1 FC IFG − IPL ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Supplementary Table 2 summarizes all correlations between RSFC and creativity assessments [ log ( CAQ ) , AUT ﬂuency and originality ] . DISCUSSION We demonstrated that the divergent thinking process ( e . g . , AUT ) could modulate the RSFC of DMN and IFGN , which were associated with creativity performance . The results indicated that the baseline RSFC DMN networks ( Pre - AUT ) were similar between the two groups , but the baseline RSFC IFGN could reﬂect the group diﬀerence . Then , the IFGN presented signiﬁcant network reorganization while the DMN did not reorganize after AUT engagements . Intriguingly , such IFGN reconﬁguration was associated with AUT performances ( originality and ﬂuency , Figure 3 ) . These ﬁndings supported that the dynamic changes of intrinsic network connections could reﬂect the cognitive performances of divergent thinking . However , the high - and Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 5 November 2020 | Volume 14 | Article 571118 Wu et al . Brain Reconﬁgurations After Divergent Thinking FIGURE 2 | IFGN and DMN RSFC patterns before and after AUT . For each network , the top panel displays the one - sample RSFC map of Pre - AUT and Post - AUT for the high - creative group , and the lower panel refers to the low - creative group . low - creative groups demonstrated distinct network—creativity associations as follows : positive relationships were evident between originality and RSFC changes in the high - creative group but the low - creative group showed non - signiﬁcant correlations ( Supplementary Table 2 ) , further indicating the dissimilar functional architectures involved in divergent thinking among individuals with diverse creativity achievements . These ﬁndings suggest that the RSFC IFGN can change dynamically in accordance with the divergent thinking process , and the populations with various creativity levels may employ distinct reconﬁgurations after divergent thinking . Network Reconﬁguration After Divergent Thinking The integrity of brain network can be modulated by the previous cognitive engagements within minutes , and the functional re - organization may be important to the cognitive performances . Previous research investigated the correlation between the IFG connectivity and the subsequent memory ( Stevens et al . , 2010 ) , disclosing the connectivity facilitates the recognition accuracy . In the current study , we focused on the dynamic RSFC changes of the two networks , DMN and IFGN , corresponded to the networks related with high - creative thinking ability reported in literature ( Beaty et al . , 2018 ) . Interestingly , the same study also demonstrated the evidence of dynamic RSFC alterations following divergent thinking . In their supporting information , Beaty et al . presented fairly similar correlations between network strengths and creativity scores based on a resting - state dataset ( r = 0 . 13 for high - creative networks and r = 0 . 11 for low - creative networks ) . However , the RSFC – creativity correlation became elevated for high - creative networks when performing the AUT ( r = 0 . 35 and 0 . 28 for two separate datasets ) , but the correlation turned out non - signiﬁcant for low - creative networks during AUT engagements ( r = 0 . 02 to − 0 . 04 for two separate datasets ) . The evidence implies that dynamic network reorganizations in AUT can be associated with the creativity performances . In this study , assuming that the short - term network reorganizations induced by AUT could sustain after the task cessation ( the second resting state in Post - AUT ) , we demonstrated that dynamic RSFC alterations were associated with the AUT performance ( originality and ﬂuency ) . Speciﬁcally , we prescribed the ROIs from both the creativity trait eﬀect ( High - creative > Low - creative deﬁned by CAQ in Table 1 ) and the creativity state eﬀect ( Post - AUT > Pre - AUT ) , because the CAQ ( trait ) and AUT performances ( state ) were highly correlated within each group ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Our results showed that DMN demonstrated the trait diﬀerence between groups ; however , no prominent state eﬀect was found in DMN . Relatively , IFGN contained both trait and state eﬀect ( Table 1 ) , indicating that the IFGN indeed presented Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 6 November 2020 | Volume 14 | Article 571118 Wu et al .

The dynamic alterations of RSFC following cognitive tasks can be regarded as a short - term functional reconﬁguration of brain circuits to facilitate associated cognitive tasks , which ﬁts the neurophysiological perspective of the dynome framework ( Kopell et al . , 2014 ) . For example , Wang et al . presented the dynamic reorganizations of DMN during and after a word - picture matching task , so as the corresponding whole - brain small - world topology ( Wang et al . , 2012 ) . However , previous studies did not speciﬁcally present the relationship between the network reconﬁguration and the cognitive performances . In the current work , Figure 3 illustrates that dynamic IFGN reconﬁgurations were in accordance with the creativity performances , supporting the short - term reconﬁguration and sustenance of network integrity underlying the mental process of divergent thinking . Regional Functionality in Divergent Thinking Three brain regions in the left hemisphere were reported to be involved in divergent thinking—the IFG , pre - / post - central gyri , and the MTG ( Boccia et al . , 2015 ) , and these are similar to our results of brain activity in AUT . Generally , the lateralization of brain function in the left hemisphere in AUT is considered to be the verbal processing and semantic memory ( Thompson - Schill , 2003 ) . In addition , the left hemisphere executes the functions of interpreting and reasoning about the sentences and the causal relationships ( Marinsek et al . , 2014 ) . By presenting the CAQ - based group diﬀerence of brain activation in AUT ( Figure 1 ) , the left IFG was highlighted in the performance of creativity , regarded as the functional localizer for the following RSFC analysis . Figure 3 illustrates the relationship between originality and the corresponding RSFC changes after AUTs ; the RSFC changes are prominent between the left IFG , right AG , and right IPL . Previously , the SPL / IPL was the core for top - down attention or abstract thinking ( Shomstein , 2012 ) , and the IPL was determined to usually play roles involving the voluntary orienting of attention to a location ( Corbetta et al . , 2000 ) . In addition , the left IFG and right IPL involved the verbal working memory ( LaBar et al . , 1999 ) , and the strength of RSFC between the left IFG and right IPL decreased in high working memory loading ( Liu et al . , 2017 ) . Furthermore , a previous study reported that the low working memory loading task could help the divergent thinking and ( Baird et al . , 2012 ) . For the multifunction of AG , the right side was determined to play the role of spatial cognition for perceptual learning and shifting attention to relevant information ( Seghier , 2013 ) . Therefore , our result demonstrated that the high - creative group leveraged from the frontoparietal reorganizations for Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 7 November 2020 | Volume 14 | Article 571118 Wu et al . Brain Reconﬁgurations After Divergent Thinking FIGURE 3 | Correlation between the functional connectivity and creative behavior : color regions of two connectivity indicate spatial locations . ( A ) The gray spheres indicate the seeds for functional connectivity , the red line represents the connectivity between the left inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG ) and the right angular gyrus ( AG ) , and the blue line indicates the connectivity between the left IFG and the right inferior parietal lobule ( IPL ) .

In contrast , the changes of RSFC in the low - creative group showed no relationship associated with the creative indexes . Following the ﬁnding , our results revealed the possibility that the low - creative group might adopt distinct strategies with respect to the semantic or sensory processing in AUT . As evident in Supplementary Table 1 , the majority of AUT - induced negative activations were located in the right hemisphere ( the superior temporal gyrus , MTG , medial frontal gyrus , precuneus , precentral gyrus , and superior frontal gyrus ) in both groups . Previously , the mechanism of the negative activation may have originated from the neural inhibition hypothesis , the aﬀected neurotransmitter caused the reduction of local cerebral blood ﬂow or the elevation of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption in the cerebrovasculature ( Sten et al . , 2017 ) . Interestingly , Benedek et al . also presented similar lateralized negative activation during idea generation ( Benedek et al . , 2014 ) . To further verify the role of negative AUT activations in creativity , the negative brain activations were associated with the log - transform CAQ , originality , and ﬂuency in both the high - and low - creative groups . We noted signiﬁcantly positive correlations between the log ( CAQ ) and the right MTG [ 52 , − 10 , − 16 ] activity ( r = 0 . 52 , p < 0 . 02 ) in the high - creative group , as well as a signiﬁcantly positive relationship between originality and the right MTG activity ( r = 0 . 51 , p < 0 . 02 ) . However , the association between the negative activation and creativity performances is beyond the scope of the current work . Future studies are warranted to discern the underlying mechanism of divergent thinking . Disparity Between High - and Low - Creative Groups About grouping of CAQ scores , we chose the median split because of a positively - skewed distribution of CAQ in Carson’s report . Additionally , the average CAQ score of Carson’s report was as high as 14 . 4 , the cut - oﬀ line would be around 8 to 9 when we adopted the median split ( Carson et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore , the cut - oﬀ threshold of 8 points was in agreement with Carson’s report . Although we used the CAQ ( the creative Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 8 November 2020 | Volume 14 | Article 571118 Wu et al . Brain Reconﬁgurations After Divergent Thinking traits ) for splitting participants into two groups , we conﬁrmed the functional brain distinction between the high - and low - creative groups when performing AUT ( Figure 1 ) , revealing the active role of the left IFG in AUT engagements . By deﬁnition , the participants with high CAQ scores were believed to possess the capability of openness to experience ( Carson et al . , 2005 ) , in part explaining that the high - creative group uses the brain systems of abstract thinking to achieve superior originality . Moreover , the between - group comparison disclosed that the DMN connectivity did not exhibit signiﬁcant diﬀerentiation at the baseline level before AUT engagements ( Table 1 ) . In IFGN , the baseline connectivity strength between the left IFG and right IPL in the high - creative group was higher than that in the low - creative group at the Pre - AUT condition . This ﬁnding was contradictory to the previous report ( Beaty et al . , 2014 ) . The disparity might be originated from the cultural diﬀerence , because previous study showed that frontal - parietal attentional control network involves in the visual and attention task and these functions exhibits cultural disparity ( Han and Northoﬀ , 2008 ; Hedden et al . , 2008 ) . Then , the connection from IFG to IPL involved the lexical judgment in Chinese studies ( Deng et al . , 2012 ) . Future studies are warranted to prove such conjecture . In addition , when comparing the RSFC IFGN changes between the two groups in Table 1 , the low - creative group demonstrated more Pre - Post connectivity diﬀerences in the posterior brain , whereas the high - creative group mostly remained unchanged . Wei et al . observed similar between - group diﬀerences in RSFC between MTG and MPFC ( Wei et al . , 2014 ) . They suggested that the group with higher TTCT scores exhibited fewer RSFC diﬀerences after creativity training , though the RSFC changes were not associated with the creativity performances . Collectively , it is speculated that each individual may possess speciﬁc brain - network plasticity to facilitate the performances of divergent thinking , where such brain reconﬁgurations are distinct between the high - and low - creative groups . Limitation This study has several limitations . First , the sample size of the current study was above the request of 36 samples for suﬃcient fMRI replicability ( Turner et al . , 2018 ) ; however , the statistical power might be reduced after splitting the samples into two equal - size groups . Compared with literature , the AUT - induced brain activities were in well - agreement with previous ﬁndings , but the RSFC might be inconsistent with other studies . The sample size higher than 20 in each group is recommended for future neuroimaging studies with AUT engagements . Second , we observed only the two most addressed functional networks in AUT , namely DMN and IFGN , by which we might miss additional AUT - related brain reconﬁgurations in other brain networks , such as the reported global architectures involved in divergent thinking ( Beaty et al . , 2018 ) . Future studies are warranted to test the whole - brain functional changes other than DMN and IFGN . Third , the group separation ( based on CAQ ) and their creative performances ( i . e . , originality and ﬂuency ) were all deﬁned by the subjective preferences from the participants or the raters . However , creativity judgment is a relatively challenging task due to the lack of objective deﬁnitions , as aforementioned . Therefore , we used the AUT activity to verify the eﬀectiveness of group separation and employed three raters to minimize the subjectivity involved in the creativity scoring . Fourth , we did not include any other cognitive tasks to test whether such network reconﬁguration is speciﬁc to the divergent thinking . It was unanswered because the assumption that the network plasticity is subject to distinct cognitive tasks has yet been studied systematically . The post - cognition network plasticity is pending for further investigations in the near future . At last , the causal relation between the network reorganization and creativity performance remains limited , because the ﬁndings in this study was built upon the assumption that the AUT - associated network reconﬁgurations can sustain in a short period of time after the cessation of tasks . The short - term sustenance of functional organizations in brain circuits shall be further tested before conﬁrming the causal relationship between network plasticity and creativity . CONCLUSION Using multiple AUTs for creativity engagements , we presented the prolonged changes of RSFCs ( DMN and IFGN ) correlated with the performances of divergent thinking . Furthermore , individuals with diﬀerent creativity level ( high - and low - creative groups ) might present diverse alterations of RSFC changes . Before divergent thinking , both high - and low - creative group did not exhibit signiﬁcant diﬀerence of DMN connectivity , but the group diﬀerence was highlighted after AUT engagements . Meanwhile , the IFGN indeed presented the network reconﬁguration after divergent thinking . Furthermore , the 1 FC IFG − AG and 1 FC IFG − IPL positively contributed to the AUT performances in the high - creative group , but no prominent brain - behavior relation was found in the low - creative group . These ﬁndings indicated that divergent - thinking performances could be modulated by distinct creativity traits and diverse brain - network reconﬁgurations .
