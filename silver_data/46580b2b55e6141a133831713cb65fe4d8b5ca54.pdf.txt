Since cell surface properties are intimately linked to cell wall structure , 23 the aim of this study was to investigate effects of autolyzing / drying process on the biochemical 24 composition of cell wall and on the nanomechanical properties of cell surface . To achieve these 25 goals , we used a recently developed method to analyze the biochemical composition , and we took 26 advantage of Atomic Force Microscopy to access the nanomechanical properties . We choose to work 27 on two industrial strains because of their difference in winemaking applications and sorption 28 properties . We found that the autolysis / drying process of the two strains did not significantly modify 29 the biochemical composition of their cell wall . It , however , caused severe changes in cell surface 30 topography characterized by a 4 - fold increase of the roughness and by a global increase in adhesion 31 characteristics of the autolyzed / dried samples . Though this process had some effects on 32 biomechanical properties , the two strains natively harbored differences in biophysical properties that 33 could be accounted by difference in cell wall composition , as the strain with the highest 34 mannoproteins content was also characterized by the presence of highly adhesive patches forming 35 nanodomains , . Comparative transcriptome analysis uncovered a strong upregulation of flocculin 36 encodin g FLO11 gene in this industrial strain that corroborated with higher interaction to 37 concanavalin A - functionalized AFM tip , leading to the idea that this protein is responsible for the 38 patches formation . 39 40 41 3 1 . Introduction 42 The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used since millennia in traditional biotechnological 43 purposes , such as the production of wine , beer and bread . In addition to this role in fermented foods 44 and beverages , this yeast species is attracting increased attention because of other relevant 45 biological properties , such as antimicrobial and biosorption activities , that make them promising 46 candidates for a wide range of applications not limited to the food sector . Indeed , the antimicrobial 47 activities against undesirable bacteria and mold have been recognized since a long time to provide 48 probiotic properties of yeasts , although the mechanisms underlying these antagonistic activities 49 remain unclear { Hatoum , 2012 5788 / id } . Biosorption is a cell surface property that is defined as the 50 physicochemical process wherein undesirable molecules which can be a toxin , heavy metals or 51 volatile compounds interact and accumulate at the surface of microbial cells { Petruzzi , 2014 5810 52 / id ; Fomina , 2014 5809 / id } . Since this property is displayed by inactive or dead cells and does not 53 require intracellular energy , the physicochemical properties of the microorganism’s surface are 54 determining factor in the nature of the interaction and in the sorption capacity . The surface of yeast 55 cell corresponds to a thick wall of about 120 - 180 nm , exhibiting an ultrastructure of two distinct 56 layers as visualized by electron microscopy { Osumi , 1998 235 / id } : an outer layer mainly constituted 57 of mannoproteins ( 30 - 50 % of cell wall dry mass ) and an inner layer made of chitin ( 2 - 5 % of cell wall 58 dry mass ) and  - glucans ( 40 - 60 % of cell wall dry mass ) . Extensive biochemical analysis allowed to 59 propose a supramolecular structure of the mature cell wall in which the chains of  - ( 1 , 3 ) glucose 60 residues are branched to  - ( 1 , 6 ) - glucans , forming a fibrillar network , that serves as backbone to 61 which are linked chitin ,  - ( 1 , 6 ) - glucan and mannoproteins . In addition , the outer layer of 62 mannoproteins can be linked to the inner layer through  - ( 1 , 6 ) - glucan via a remnant of a GPI anchor 63 { Lesage , 2006 3212 / id } . It is therefore suggested that the sorption capacity for a given molecule can 64 be linked to a specific component of the yeast cell wall . This suggestion has been verified in very few 65 cases . For example , a major role of mannoproteins in the retention of volatile aroma by yeast cell 66 walls has been reported { Lubbers , 1994 551 / id ; Pradelles , 2008 5792 / id } , whereas  - glucan was 67 4 showed as a valuable microbiological binder of the mycotoxin zearalenone { Yiannikouris , 2004 3122 68 / id } . However , these studies were mostly carried out with pure fractions of polysaccharides and did 69 take into account neither the complexity and variability of the cell wall composition , that can depend 70 on culture conditions { Aguilar - Uscanga , 2003 1148 / id } and strains background { Nguyen , 1998 432 71 / id } , nor the process by which yeast cells are prepared and used as biosorbant . In this context , 72 Pradelles et al { Pradelles , 2008 5792 / id } investigated effects of cell wall composition on the sorption 73 of the undesirable 4 - ethylphenol . While they confirmed a predominant role of mannoproteins in the 74 sorption capacity of this volatile aromatic compound , they also highlighted the fact that drying the 75 yeast biomass greatly increased the sorption capacity of this molecule , which was in part correlated 76 with increased surface hydrophobicity of the dried biomass rehydrated subsequently in water 77 { Pradelles , 2009 5793 / id } . Taken together , these results indicate that the drying process and more 78 generally the method to prepare yeast cell wall fractions for biosorption applications may have a 79 strong impact on physico - chemical properties of the cell surface . This question is particularly 80 pertinent when we consider that yeast cells employed for biosorption applications are obtained from 81 cultures that are autolysed and air - dried at 55°C , and commercially supplied as ‘yeast cell wall’ 82 fraction or YCW . Autolysis is a term that describes the breakdown of cell constituents by action of 83 endogenous enzymes . It can occur naturally when yeast have completed their growth cycle and 84 entered the death phase , or it can be induced at high temperature and low pH { White , 2002 4963 85 / id } { Martinez - Rodriguez , 2009 455 / id } . Proteases ,  - glucanases and chitinases are among autolytic 86 hydrolases that are implicated in this process , and therefore , it can be expected that this process 87 may cause important change in cell wall composition . Accordingly , Martinez - Rodriguez et al 88 { Martinez - Rodriguez , 2001 4964 / id } reported important ultrastructural changes during the autolysis 89 of yeast cells using Low Temperature Scanning Electron Microscopy ( LTSEM ) , whereas Aerosol Flow 90 Tube - Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy ( AFT - FTIR ) that was used to monitor global 91 biochemical changes during autolysis revealed hydrolysis of mannans and  - glucans . In spite of these 92 apparent hydrolyses , microscopic observation of autolyzed cells showed that the cell shape was fully 93 5 retained suggesting that the cell wall structure was not destroyed { Hernawan , 1995 4965 / id } . 94 Altogether , these studies raised fundamental questions about the effects of industrial processes on 95 structure and properties of yeast cell surface . 96 These questions can be addressed using Atomic Force Microscope ( AFM ) which is a very 97 powerful force microscope technology allowing tridimensional images of cell surface and 98 quantitative measurement of nanomechanical properties such as roughness and elasticity ( Young 99 modulus ) { Dague , 2007 443 / id ; Dufrene , 2010 5053 / id } . We used recently this technology to image 100 and quantify surface properties of yeast cell wall mutants { Dague , 2010 5052 / id } , to investigate 101 effects of antifungal drug caspofungin and heat shock on yeast cells ( Formosa et al . , 2013 ; Pillet et 102 al . , 2014 ) . These studies led to the finding that the nanomechanical properties of the cell surface are 103 merely dependent on the molecular architecture of the cell wall and not on a specific polysaccharide 104 component of the wall . To gain deeper knowledge on the molecular organization of cell wall , the 105 single molecule force spectroscopy ( SMFS ) can be employed . This method consists in probing the cell 106 with an AFM tip that is functionalized with a specific ligand that could interact with some proteins 107 present at the cell surface { Hinterdorfer , 2012 463 / id } . Accordingly , probing the yeast cell surface 108 with AFM tip functionalized with concanavalin A ( conA tip ) , which is a lectin protein that interacts 109 with D - mannose and glucose residues ( ref ) , has provided quantitative information about distribution , 110 frequency of adhesion events , flexibility and extension of mannans on the surface of different yeast 111 strains { Dufrene , 2013 459 / id } . With this approach , Alsteens et al . { Alsteens , 2008 457 / id } 112 investigated the surface properties of a bottom - fermenting and a top - fermenting yeast . They showed 113 that the latter species has higher adhesion frequency and more extended polysaccharides than the 114 former one , consistent with the fact that the surface of top - fermenting yeast cells is richer in 115 proteins and more hydrophobic . 116 The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate effects of industrial autolysis and 117 drying process on cell wall composition and cell surface nanomechanical properties of two industrial 118 yeast strains that bear differences in winemaking properties . Effects of this process on adhesive 119 6 properties and on polysaccharides distribution using conA tip of the two strains were also analyzed 120 by comparing whole active - living from rehydrated dried yeast cells . 121 7 2 . Material and Methods 122 2 . 1 . Strains and culture conditions 123 Two diploid industrial winemaking Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains , L71 and L69 , from 124 Lallemand Inc . ( Blagnac , France ) were studied . Differences between the two strain was mainly that 125 the L69 strain has a higher mannoproteins content , expresses different sensorial notes during wine 126 fermentation and presents good capacity to interact with volatile undesirable phenols ( Lallemand 127 Inc . , unpublished data ) . The strains were propagated under standard laboratory conditions , which 128 corresponded to growth in 200 ml YPD medium ( 1 % [ w / v ] yeast extract , 2 % [ w / v ] bactopeptone and 129 2 % [ w / v ] glucose ) in 1 liter shake flasks at 30°C under shaking at 200 rpm . They were also propagated 130 under industrial standard protocol , involving batch and fed - batch growth on molasses based 131 medium , collected , and concentrated to produce packed yeast cells termed ‘cream’ . The latter 132 cream was then subjected to autolysis ( 20 hr at 55°C ) , followed by separation and then by spray - 133 drying to produce the dry “YCW” ( industrial term meaning Yeast Cell Wall fraction that is used for 134 this type of yeast packaging ) . This autolytic / drying process leads to > 99 . 9 % of cell mortality as 135 estimated by methylene blue coloration test { Cot , 2007 5468 / id } . YCW were provided in 30 g packets 136 sealed under vacuum and stored unopened at 4°C until required . Rehydration was performed 137 according to the manufacturer’s guidelines ( Lallemand Inc . , Blagnac , France ) : 0 . 1 g of YCW was 138 sprinkled onto 10× its weight of temperature equilibrated ( 30°C ) sterile water in a tube . The YCW 139 was left to absorb water slowly for 20 min , mixed gently to form slurry and the temperature was 140 maintained at 30°C throughout rehydration . 141 2 . 2 . AFM measurements 142 2 . 2 . 1 . Sample preparation 143 Cells collected from exponential growth in YPD or after rehydration of YCW were washed two 144 times in sodium acetate ( 18 mM CH 3 COONa , 1 mM CaCl 2 and , 1 mM MnCl 2 , pH 5 . 2 ) , and immobilized 145 on polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) stamps prepared as described in { Dague , 2011 442 / id } . Briefly , 146 freshly oxygen activated microstructured PDMS stamps were covered by 100 µL of yeasts sample at 147 8 OD 600 around 1 . 0 . The cells were then deposited into the microstructures of the stamp by 148 convective / capillary assembly . 149 2 . 2 . 2 . AFM imaging 150 Images and force - distance curves were recorded at room temperature in acetate solution 151 using an AFM Nanowizard III ( JPK Instruments , Berlin , Germany ) and MLCT AUWH cantilevers 152 ( Bruker , Santa Barbara , USA ) . The spring constants of the cantilevers were systematically measured 153 by the thermal noise method according to { Hutter JL , 1993 5529 / id } and were found to be in the 154 range of 0 . 01 - 0 . 02 N . m - 1 . AFM height and adhesion images were recorded in Quantitative Imaging TM 155 mode { Chopinet , 2013 454 / id } , and the maximal force applied to the cell was limited to 1 . 5 nN . 156 2 . 2 . 3 . Surface roughness measurements 157 To measure cell surface roughness , images were obtained by scanning at high resolution 158 ( 1µm x 1µm areas ) on independent cell samples ( at least 5 ) in the contact mode . In contact mode , 159 the tip is in contact with the surface of the sample and scans this surface horizontally with a constant 160 force , which is lower as possible . Height and vertical deflection images were both recorded with the 161 contact mode . Height images with the same center of offset were processed and analyzed with the 162 power spectral density method ( JPK data processing software ) consisting of average roughness ( Ra in 163 nm ) measurements on five boxes of five different sizes for each images . 164 2 . 2 . 4 . Stiffness measurements 165 Results were analyzed using the Data Processing software from JPK Instruments . The stiffness 166 value ( k cell in N . m - 1 ) measured on cells was determined from the cantilever spring constant ( k ) and the 167 slope ( s ) of the linear part of the force curve according to { Arnoldi , 2000 4684 / id } : 168 2 . 2 . 5 . Force spectroscopy 169 For force spectroscopy experiments , the applied force was kept constant at 0 . 5 nN . To probe 170 cell surface polysaccharides , AFM tips were functionalized with the concanavalin A ( ConA ) from 171 Canavalia ensiformis ( Sigma - Aldrich , L7647 ) via a dendritip as described in { Jauvert , 2012 5569 / id } . 172 The coupling with the lectin was made by immersion of the dendritip in 100 µL of ConA solution ( 100 173 9 µg . ml - 1 in a 0 . 1 M carbonate buffer ) . After 1 hr incubation , 100 µL of NaBH 4 3 . 5 mg . mL - 1 solution was 174 added and incubated 15 min in order to reduce the unreacted groups . Finally , the cantilever bearing 175 the functionalized tip was washed three times and stored in acetate buffer . To analyze the stretching 176 of polysaccharides at the surface of the cell , elongation forces were stretched using the worm - like 177 chain ( WLC ) model introduced by Bustamante { Bustamante , 1994 5811 / id } which describes the 178 polymer as a curved filament and the force F vs the extension x is given by : 179 F ( x ) = k b T / l p [ 0 . 25 ( 1 - x / L c ) - 2 + x / L c - 0 . 25 ] 180 where the persistent length ( l p ) represents the stiffness of the molecule , the contour length ( L c ) is the 181 total length of the stretched molecule , k b is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute 182 temperature . This model has already been successfully used for the stretching of polysaccharides of 183 yeasts especially for S . cerevisiae and S . carlsbergensis { Alsteens , 2008 457 / id } and gives the best 184 fitting of force curves . Blocking control experiments were performed by injecting 100 mM D - 185 mannose solution into the cell surface . 186 2 . 3 . Cell wall isolation and quantification of polysaccharides 187 Yeast cell walls were extracted and purified from yeast culture of L71 and 69 taken in 188 exponential phase of growth on glucose ( OD 600 = 1 ) , rehydrated YCW and ‘cream’ according to the 189 protocol described in { Francois , 2006 4678 / id } . Cell wall polysaccharides mannan , chitin ,  - ( 1 , 3 ) and 190  - ( 1 , 6 ) glucan in the purified cell walls were determined by a combination of acid and enzymatic 191 hydrolysis recently developed { Schiavone , 2014 457 / id } and quantification of the release sugar 192 monomers ( mannose , glucose and N - acetylglucosamine ) was determined by High Performance 193 Anionic Exchange Chromatography ( HPAEC ) with Pulsed Amperometric Detection ( PAD ) as described 194 in { Dallies , 1998 224 / id } . 195 2 . 4 . Transcriptomic analyses 196 Three independent biological cultures of industrial strains L71 and L69 were carried out in 50 197 ml of YPD in a 250 ml shake flasks . Yeast cells ( about 10 OD 600 units ) were collected at OD 600 = 1 by 198 10 centrifugation ( 3 , 000 rpm , 4°C , 2 min ) , followed by a washing step with 1 ml of sterilized water . The 199 cell pellets were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80°C until RNA extraction . RNA 200 extraction , quantification and labelling were carried out as described in { Alkim , 2013 5685 / id } . 201 Labeled cDNA were hybridized on Agilent glass slides microarrays , which bear the whole 202 Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome ( see details at 203 http : / / www . biocompare . com / ProductDetails / 760330 / S - cerevisiae - Saccharomycescerevisiae - Whole - 204 Genome . html ) . Hybridization was carried out in an automatic hybridization chamber ( Agilent 205 Technologies , Wilmington , USA ) for 17 hr at 65°C . The hybridization signals were detected by 206 scanning using Innoscan 900 laser Scanner ( Innopsys Instruments ) , and transformed to numerical 207 values using Feature Extraction V . 11 . 5 . 1 . 1 . The microarrays hybridization and processing were 208 carried out at the Biochips Platform of Toulouse ( http : / / biopuce . insa - toulouse . fr ) . 209 Transcriptome analyses were done in R computing environment ( www . R - project . org ) using 210 the Limma package { Yang , 2002 2877 / id } ( www . bioconductor . org ) . The estimates used for the 211 foreground and background intensities were the median of pixels intensity . Raw data were imported 212 into R and spot quality weights were performed assigning a weight of 1 or 0 to each spot . Low - quality 213 spots , non - uniform spots , spots with low signal / background ratio or spots with low signal - to - noise 214 ratio and empty or non - validated spots were down weighted . Data were preprocessed by base 2 215 logarithmic transformation and within - array normalized was performed using the weighted global 216 median ( spots with zero weight were not included in the normalization ) . To achieve consistency of 217 expression values between arrays , normalization across all the microarrays for each strain was 218 performed . After normalization , the expression of a gene was calculated by the median of replicate 219 spots within each microarray . Gene expression data for both strains were pairwise compared using 220 the Limma package { Smith , 2005 5083 / id } . Genes with significant evidence for differential expression 221 were identified with a modified t - test in conjunction with an empirical Bayes method to moderate 222 the standard errors of the estimated log - fold changes . The P - values for the genes of interest were 223 adjusted for multiple testing by the ' ' BH ' ' method { Hochberg , 1990 3432 / id } . 224 11 225 226 12 3 . Results 227 3 . 1 . Effects of autolysis / drying process on cell wall composition of two industrial yeast strains . 228 Since it is considered that the interaction cell - environment and sorption capacity to 229 undesirable compounds are dependent on the surface properties of yeasts , which are in turn 230 impacted by the biochemical composition of cell wall { Pradelles , 2008 5792 / id ; Nunez , 2008 4953 231 / id ; Armando , 2012 5219 / id } , we aimed at investigating effects of the industrial autolysis / drying 232 process on cell wall composition of two industrial strains . These strains were chosen on the basis of 233 their different winemaking behavior and content of mannoproteins ( Lallemand Inc , unpublished 234 data ) . To evaluate impact of the process , we compared the polysaccharides composition of cell walls 235 purified from autolyzed / dried yeast cells , which are commercialized as “YCW” , with those extracted 236 from the same industrial strains that were cultivated under laboratory standard conditions ( Yeast 237 Peptone Dextrose medium ) and harvested at the exponential phase of growth . The cell wall 238 composition was also determined on packed yeast cells which are provided as ‘cream’ and which was 239 obtained from batch fermentation in molasses - based medium . Results of this analysis are reported in 240 Table 1 . Overall , the polysaccharides content in purified cell wall was between 85 to 90 % of the cell 241 wall dry mass , the remaining 10 to 15 % corresponded to proteins ( data not shown ) . Also , the 242 proportion of  - ( 1 , 3 ) ,  - ( 1 , 6 ) - glucan , mannan and chitin in cell wall of the two industrial strains were 243 statistically not different ( p value > 0 . 05 ) between the three conditions / treatments investigated . 244 However , it can be noticed a strain effect on the biochemical composition of the cell wall that was 245 statistically significant . Indeed , strain L71 either in a living , cream or dried stated exhibited two times 246 more chitin ( p value < 0 . 001 ) and a higher proportion of  - ( 1 , 6 ) - glucan in total  - glucan than in strain 247 L69 . On the other hand , the mannan content of the L69 strain was roughly 20 - 25 % higher than in 248 strain L71 ( p value < 0 . 01 ) , which agreed with the fact that this industrial winemaking strain was 249 selected on the basis of its higher production of mannoproteins . This high mannan content of strain 250 L69 could be associated with the fact that this strain has a higher surface hydrophobicity than strain 251 13 L71 ( data not shown ) as well as to a tendency to hold cells together in small branched chain during 252 growth and to produce clumps upon rehydration of YCW produced from this strain ( data not shown ) . 253 3 . 2 . Effects of autolysis / drying process on nanomechanical properties of two industrial yeast 254 strains . 255 In accordance with a previous work { Hernawan , 1995 4965 / id } , rehydrated YCW regained 256 round to ovoid cell shape like a normal living yeast cell ( data not shown ) . This cell shape retention 257 allowed using our immobilization methodology that is based on trapping of single round / ovoid yeast 258 cell into microchambers made in microstructured PDMS stamp by capillary / convective means 259 { Dague , 2011 442 / id } . This methodology is very efficient to readily monitor several isolated cells in 260 liquid environment by AFM . Topographic images using Quantitative Imaging™ mode { Chopinet , 2013 261 454 / id } of living yeast cells from strain L71 and rehydrated YCW derived from L71 strain is reported 262 in Figure 1 ( a and b ) . For both types of yeast samples , height images illustrated a rather round shape 263 of the immobilized object with an apparent smooth surface . However , a closer inspection of the AFM 264 images from the rehydrated sample revealed the presence of a single hole of 600 nm diameter size 265 curiously localized in the middle of immobilized cell ( Fig . S1 in supplementary data ) , and this feature 266 was obtained in at least 15 % of the analyzed cells . At higher resolution , height images ( Fig . 1 c and d ) 267 from contact mode clearly showed significant differences of the surface between living and 268 rehydrated sample from L71 strain , as the surface of the latter was severely fractured . In quantitative 269 terms , the roughness of cell surface ( determined on 1 µm x 1 µm areas ) was around 1 . 9 ± 0 . 2 nm for 270 the living cell and increased to 5 . 1 ± 1 . 1 nm for the rehydrated YCW sample ( Table 2 ) . This surface 271 change could be linked to the ultrastructural changes that was reported by Low Temperature 272 Scanning Electron Microscopy ( LSTEM ) of a commercial yeast strain after 14 hr of induced autolysis in 273 a model wine medium { Martinez - Rodriguez , 2001 4964 / id } . Figure 1 ( e , f ) shows adhesion images of 274 a living and rehydrated cell from YCW of L71 strain that were obtained by probing the surface with 275 an AFM tip in QI™ mode . As the tip is made of silicon nitride and the immobilized sample is under an 276 acidic pH ( sodium acetate 18 mM at pH 5 . 2 ) , these conditions most likely favor hydrophobic 277 14 interactions , which are however relatively weak with both type of cells , and hence agreed with 278 exposure of ‘neutral’ cell wall carbohydrates . 279 Similar AFM analyses were carried out with active living yeast cells and rehydrated YCW of 280 L69 strain . The topographic images taken at low resolution ( Fig 2 , a and c ) did not show difference in 281 both types of cell samples immobilized in PDMS ( Fig . 2 ) . At higher resolution , some discretional dots 282 could be visualized that were rather larger in rehydrated YCW ( Fig 2 , b and d ) . In addition , we found a 283 hole in immobilized rehydrated samples of YCW in about at least 15 % of the AFM images , like it was 284 seen for strain L71 ( see Fig . S1 supplementary data ) . The force curves acquired in QI mode were also 285 analyzed to obtain adhesion images . This analysis revealed adhesives patches that were not present 286 in L71 strain and which became apparently bigger in the sample from rehydrated YCW ( compared 287 Fig . 2 a , e , i for active yeast cells with c , g and k for rehydrated YCW ) . On average , the patches from 288 the rehydrated YCW had a mean area of 156663 . 4 ± 3904 . 4 nm 2 ( 0 . 016 ± 0 . 004 µm 2 ) and a diameter 289 of 141 ± 32 nm ( measured from 56 patches on 7 different cells with Image J software ) . Additional 290 details of the morphology and mechanical properties of these patches are reported in Figure 3 and 291 Figure S2 in supplementary data . From a cross - section taken through several patches ( see the green 292 dashed line ) , the corresponding height , adhesion and stiffness values were determined . This detailed 293 AFM analyses showed that these patches corresponded to small protuberances exceeding the cell 294 surface as shown in Figure 3Ae ( also shown in Figure S2 b and d , in supplementary data ) . by about 30 295 - 40 nm ( Fig . 3A ) . These protuberances strongly interacted with the AFM tip ( Fig . 3B ) . Example of 296 adhesion force is schematically illustrated by force - distance curves taken from 3 different patches 297 ( Fig . 3B ) . On the contrary , these patches exhibited lower stiffness than the ground surface of the 298 rehydrated YCW sample . Recently , similar observation was made with other Candida albicans cells 299 that also harbored nanodomains at its cell surface represented by hydrophobic patches that were 300 likely due to high expression the ALS1 encoding cell surface protein ( Alsteens et al . , 2010 ; Formosa et 301 al . , 2014 , Nanomedicine ) . Taken together , these results provide some clues about the surface 302 properties of L69 strain which were distinct from those of L71 strain . 303 15 304 3 . 3 . Probing mannans polysaccharides at the cell surface using an AFM tip functionalized with 305 Concanavalin A . 306 To go deeper in the analysis of the process effect on cell surface properties and illustrate 307 differences in cell surface between the two industrial strains , we employed the single molecule force 308 spectroscopy ( SMFS ) using an AFM tip functionalized with ConA . This molecule is a lectin protein that 309 has high affinity to α - mannosyl residues , with an unbinding force which corresponds to the rupture 310 of a single lectin - mannose has been estimated in the range of 60 pN { Alsteens , 2008 457 / id } . Figure 311 4 shows results of distribution , adhesion and flexibility of mannans at the surface of a living and YCW 312 rehydrated from L71 strain . Adhesion force maps ( Fig . 4 , b and f ) obtained with 1024 force - distance 313 curves recorded with the ConA tip showed a relatively homogenous distribution of mannans 314 polysaccharides across the surface of the rehydrated L71 sample , whereas this distribution was 315 apparently less regular for the living cell . However , the adhesion frequency which represent the 316 percentage of single or multiple unbinding forces was in the range of 25 % for both types of yeast 317 samples ( Fig . 4 , c and g ) with a mean value of unbinding forces around a maximum of 60 pN ( 58 ± 21 318 pN for the living cell and 65 ± 38 pN for the rehydrated sample , this difference being statistically not 319 significant with a calculated p value > 0 . 05 ) in accordance with a previous report { Alsteens , 2008 457 320 / id } . Moreover , this binding interaction was blocked at 92 . 5 % by addition of excess of mannose 321 solution onto the immobilized samples ( see Fig . S2 , in supplementary data ) . This result indicated that 322 the adhesion force merely originates from specific lectin - mannans interactions . However , the 7 . 5 % 323 residual adhesion suggested some unspecific interactions . We also noticed that bud scars in both 324 type of yeast samples were not adhesive ( data not shown ) . An additional property of the mannan 325 polysaccharides that can be obtained using this SMFS approach is the rupture distances which define 326 the distance needed to retract the conA tip from its binding with the mannan polysaccharides . These 327 data can be informative on the flexibility and extension of these macromolecules . As can be seen in 328 Fig . 4 ( d and h ) , the rupture distances recorded for both types of samples was comprised between 0 329 16 and 250 nm , with a slight wider distribution towards larger lengths for the rehydrated sample 330 suggesting that the polysaccharides chains in this sample were slightly more adhesive and extended 331 than in living cells . 332 We then carried out a similar experiment with strain L69 . Results of this SMFS analysis using 333 ConA tip are reported in Figure 5 . It can be seen that , like for the previous L71 strain , adhesion force 334 map from the rehydrated YCW of L69 strain was more homogeneous than that of a living cell . 335 However , longer rupture distances ( up to 350 nm ) were recorded on the living cell of L69 strain as 336 compared to those with living L71 cells ( compare Fig . 4d and Fig . 5d ) , suggesting difference in the 337 stretching of polysaccharides between these two strains . In addition , longer rupture distances in L69 338 than in L71 strain were consistent with higher adhesion and presence of patches at the cell surface of 339 the L69 strain . Alternatively or complementary to this explanation , it is possible that L69 strain 340 expressed more and / or different mannoproteins than L71 strain . Also , on average , the rupture 341 distance obtained with living cell of L69 was apparently longer than that of the rehydrated YCW of 342 the same strain ( Fig . 5 d and h ) . 343 3 . 4 . Transcriptomic analyses to infer differences in cell surface properties between the two 344 industrial strains . 345 To seek for a molecular explanation of the difference between cell surface properties 346 between the two industrial strains , we carried out a genome - wide scale expression analysis using 347 DNA microarrays . On a global view , we obtained 392 differentially expressed genes between L69 348 versus L71 strain , that were distributed into 175 upregulated and 217 downregulated genes ( see 349 table S1 and S2 in supplementary material ) . Major differences between L69 versus L71 strains were 350 found in the downregulation of several genes implicated in sulfate and methionine metabolism as 351 well as in a relatively increased expression of genes with yet unclear function . We looked more 352 carefully to genes implicated in cell wall biogenesis and assembly to find out potential differentially 353 expressed genes that could be linked to difference in cell surface properties between the two strains . 354 As reported in Table 2 , strain L69 was characterized by higher expression levels of genes encoding 355 17 mannoproteins . In particular , FLO11 encoding a mucin - like protein that belongs to the flocculation 356 gene family { Lo , 1996 164 / id ; Van Mulders , 2009 5797 / id } was strongly upregulated in L69 strain . 357 Since this protein has a highly hydrophobic character { Karunanithi , 2010 5795 / id } , this can explain 358 the hydrophobic adhesions recorded by AFM ( Fig . 3 ) . In addition , the relative higher expression of 359 YHR213w encoding a putative flocculin may further contribute to this hydrophobicity property as 360 well as to the presence of patches at the cell surface of L69 strain . There was however some cell wall 361 encoding genes whose expression was slightly more expressed in strain L71 relative to L69 strain , 362 such as FLO5 encoding a lectin - like cell wall protein , but this differential expression can be 363 considered as insignificant to account for difference in adhesion properties between the two strains . 364 4 . Discussion 365 Combination of biochemical analyses and AFM technology allows us to observe that 366 packaging yeast cells as “YCW” by autolysis and drying process significantly affected the global 367 surface properties of the cells , in spite of the fact that the biochemical composition of the cell wall 368 was barely altered by this packaging process . This result reinforces our previous finding showing no 369 direct relationship between the polysaccharides composition of cell wall and its bionanomechanical 370 properties { Dague , 2010 5052 / id ; Pillet , 2014 5726 / id ; Formosa , 2013 5624 / id } . Also , the finding that 371 cell wall composition remained barely unchanged after autolysis and drying process is at variance to 372 other reports that indicated some loss of  - glucan and mannans during this process { Cavagna , 2010 373 4950 / id ; Giovani , 2007 4954 / id } . However , the discrepancy can be explained by the difference in the 374 autolysis process . In our study , it is an industrial process that consisted in an induced autolysis at high 375 temperature for 20 h , whereas other studies were related to yeast autolysis during wine 376 fermentation that lasted several days and was done at lower temperature { Martinez - Rodriguez , 2009 377 455 / id ; Alexandre , 2006 456 / id } . As compared to living or active yeast cells , the main effect of 378 autolysis / drying process was to increase the roughness of the cell surface , which was visualized as a 379 change from a relatively smooth to wrinkled structure . It remains to evaluate whether this 380 modification has some impact in the sorption capacity of the yeast cells . 381 18 In a previous work , we showed that the mode of cultivation and medium composition 382 influenced the cell wall composition { Aguilar - Uscanga , 2003 1148 / id } , while other studies 383 demonstrated differences in cell wall composition among different yeasts species { Nguyen , 1998 432 384 / id } . Here , we furthermore showed that even for a same yeast species that is endowed with same 385 genome , the biochemical composition of the cell wall and its cell surface organization can be 386 dramatically different . These differences can be explained in part by difference in gene expression 387 levels . Indeed , we found that the transcript levels of FLO11 encoding a flocculin and of YHR213w that 388 is suggested to code also for a flocculin , were relatively much higher in L69 than in L71 strain . In 389 addition , several patches in the nanometer size were detected at the cell surface of L69 strain by 390 AFM that resembled nanodomains identified at the cell surface of the pathogenic yeast C . albicans 391 ( Alsteens et al . , 2010 ; Formosa et al . , 2014 ) . In C . albicans , these nanodomains were attributed to the 392 presence of massive amount of ALS1 encoding adhesins which forms amyloid due to seven residues 393 sequence enriched in  - branched amino acids ( Ile , Thre , Val ) that are predicted to form 394 intramolecular  - sheet like interactions or amyloids { Lipke , 2012 449 / id } . Recently , it was found that 395 the sequence of the S . cerevisiae Flo11 protein presents such amyloid forming motifs VVSTTV and 396 VTTAVT that can lead to partial  - aggregation { Ramsook , 2010 5812 / id } . Therefore , the higher 397 expression for this flocculin encoding gene in L69 strain may account for the formation of the 398 nanodomains , for the difference in the stretching properties of the mannoprotein of this strain as 399 compared to L71 strain , as well as for the tendency of L69 cells to form aggregates ( data not shown ) . 400 Furthermore , the higher content of mannans measured in L69 strain can be also explained by a 401 higher level in Flo11 which is known to be a very highly glycosylated protein as well as by other GPI - 402 anchored mannoproteins , since the expression of their corresponding genes was found increased as 403 compared to strain L71 . On the other side , the reduced levels of  - ( 1 , 6 ) glucan and chitin in L69 strain 404 were not associated with reduced expression levels of the main genes related to their biosynthesis or 405 regulation { Lesage , 2006 3212 / id } , suggesting that these differences between the two strains would 406 be at the post - transcriptional regulation . For chitin , it is well established that chitin synthase 3 ( CSIII ) 407 19 encoded by CHS3 is responsible for > 90 % of the chitin in exponential growing yeast and that this 408 protein is regulated at the post - translational level , which implicated notably an endocytic process 409 mechanism that retrieves CSIII from chitosomes to plasma membrane ( review in { Orlean , 2012 5610 410 / id } ) . Regulation of  - ( 1 , 6 ) - glucan is also very complex and takes place along the secretory pathway 411 because several of the proteins implicated in the synthesis of this polymer were localized in the ER , 412 Golgi or plasma membrane . Thus , the synthesis of  - glucan can be regulated at the level of any of 413 these enzymatic steps during this process . 414 In conclusion , our combined biochemical and biophysical analyses of living - active and 415 autolyzed cells confirmed , on the one hand that for a given yeast strain , changes in biomechanical 416 properties of the cell surface caused by the process packaging are not linked to changes in cell wall 417 composition . On the other hand , the significant difference in a particular and specific cell wall 418 component between yeast strains could result in important difference in the biophysical properties 419 of the surface between these strains . 420 421 5 .
