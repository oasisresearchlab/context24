Despite their utility for modeling development and disease , the relationship of mouse and human pluripotent stem cell states to one another remains largely undeﬁned . We have shown that mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells and epiblast stem cells ( EpiSCs ) are distinct , pluripotent states isolated from pre - and post - implantation embryos respectively . Human ES cells are different than mouse ES cells and share deﬁning features with EpiSCs , yet are derived from pre - implantation human embryos . Here we show that EpiSCs can be routinely derived from pre - implantation mouse embryos . The preimplantation - derived EpiSCs ex - hibit molecular features and functional properties consistent with bona ﬁde EpiSCs . These results provide a simple method for isolating EpiSCs and offer direct insight into the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that regulate the acquisition of distinct pluripotent states . INTRODUCTION Theinvitroderivationofpluripotentstemcellsbothfromembryonic and adult tissues holds tremendous promise for biology and medicine . Until recently , access to the pluripotent state in vitro was thought to be limited to the derivation of embryonic stem ( ES ) cellsfrompreimplantationblastocystsandthereprogramming of cells in the germ cell lineage . Reports of new pluripotent cell types including induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells and epiblast stem cells ( EpiSCs ) provided a major impetus for recent studies that evaluate the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms regulating a cell’s acquisition of a pluripotent state ( Brons et al . , 2007 ; Taka - hashi and Yamanaka , 2006 ; Tesar et al . , 2007 ) . However , we still have only a primitive knowledge of the molecular mechanisms controlling the acquisition and maintenance of pluripotency . Equally unclear is how distinct pluripotent states relate to one another as well as to cells in vivo in the developing embryo . The archetypal pluripotent stem cells , mouse ES cells , are routinely derived from preimplantation morula and blastocyst - stage embryos ( Brook and Gardner , 1997 ; Evans and Kaufman , 1981 ; Martin , 1981 ; Tesar , 2005 ) . These cells can be expanded indeﬁnitely in culture while maintaining a stable genome and an undifferentiated state . Mouse ES cells are remarkably able to differentiate into all cell types of the embryo proper both in vitro and in chimeras in vivo . Mouse ES cells , however , do not directly recapitulatethemolecularorsignalingpropertiesoftheirtissueof originandinsteadrelyonsomegenesandsignalingpathwaysnot expressed or required in vivo in the blastocyst including genes such as Nr3b2 / Esrrb and Nr0b1 / Dax1 and the LIF / Jak / Stat signaling pathway ( Chenoweth et al . , 2010 ; Ivanova et al . , 2006 ; Niakan et al . , 2006 ; Niwa et al . , 1998 , 2009 ; Wang et al . , 2006 ; Yu et al . , 1998 ; Zhang et al . , 2008 ) . While mouse ES cells have been widely employed in laboratories across the world , their developmental origin and properties still remain unclear . EpiSCs , on the other hand , are routinely isolated from the epiblast of early postimplantation rodent embryos and recapitu - late the deﬁning properties of their in vivo tissue of origin ( Bao et al . , 2009 ; Brons et al . , 2007 ; Guo et al . , 2009 ; Tesar et al . , 2007 ) . Thesecellsarepluripotentastheyareimpressivelycapable of differentiating into cell types of all three embryonic germ layers as well as the germ lineage in vitro ( Aoki et al . , 2009 ; Hayashi and Surani , 2009 ; Tesaretal . , 2007 ; Vallieretal . , 2009 ) . EpiSCscanbe expandedindeﬁnitelyinculturebeingmaintainedinanundifferen - tiated state by activin / Nodal and FGF signaling pathways ( Brons et al . , 2007 ; Guo et al . , 2009 ; Tesar et al . , 2007 ) . EpiSCs are regu - lated by a stable pluripotent state that is distinct from that of preimplantation - derived mouse ES cells . Similar to mouse ES cells , human ES cells are derived from preimplantation embryos ( Thomson et al . , 1998 ) . Due to their common origin , the pluripotent state of mouse and human ES cellswasgenerallythoughttobeidentical . Wepreviouslyshowed that human ES cells are distinct from mouse ES cells and , para - doxically , share deﬁning features with the postimplantation epiblast state ( Tesar et al . , 2007 ) . Unfortunately , the molecular and cellular events that promote ES cell derivation remain poorly described . It remains unclear why pluripotent cell lines isolated from explanted mouse preimplantation embryos can attain 318 Cell Stem Cell 8 , 318 – 325 , March 4 , 2011 ª 2011 Elsevier Inc . a mouse ES cell state , while pluripotent cell lines isolated from explanted human preimplantation embryos attain a state similar to that of the postimplantation epiblast . To address these issues , we analyzed the impact of extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms on the acquisition of in vitro pluripotent states when starting from preimplantation mouse embryos . Our results show that both the mouse ES cell and EpiSC states can be derived from the preimplantation blastocyst stage . The acqui - sition of these states is dependent on extrinsic signals in the culture medium as well as strain - intrinsic genetic elements . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Epiblast Stem Cells Can Be Derived from Preimplantation Mouse Embryos The preimplantation blastocyst - stage embryo consists of two overtly distinct tissues types , the trophectoderm and the inner Figure 1 . Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors Contribute to the Acquisition of Distinct Pluripotent States from Preimplantation Mouse Embryos To derive pluripotent stem cells , preimplantation blastocyst - stage embryos at E3 . 5 ( shown as a 3D reconstruction immunostained for Oct3 / 4 [ red ] and Cdx2 [ green ] ) were ( A ) explanted and grown for 6 days under speciﬁc conditions ( see Experimental Procedures ) at which point few cells remained positive for the Oct3 / 4 . ( B ) Using passaging protocols described in this manuscript , both ‘‘ﬂat’’ and ‘‘domed’’ colony morphologies were evident by day 16 . ( C ) ‘‘Domed’’coloniesgave rise to Oct3 / 4 + mouse ES cell lines while ( D ) ‘‘ﬂat’’ colonies produced Oct3 / 4 + EpiSCs . ( E ) The derivation efﬁciency for blastocyst - derived mouse ES cells and EpiSCs was 28 % and 26 % , respectively , in strain 129 but intrinsic genetic elements present in other strains as well as extrinsic modulation of signaling pathways altered the efﬁciencies . cell mass ( ICM ) ( Gardner and Rossant , 1979 ; Rossant et al . , 1978 ) . The ICM contains precursors that will generate the epiblast , which , after implantation , will differentiate into all of the somatic and germ cell lineages of the embryo proper ( Lawson et al . , 1991 ) . The ICM of the blastocyst has therefore served as a source of cells for the in vitro derivation of pluripotent ES cells from both mice and man ( Evans and Kaufman , 1981 ; Martin , 1981 ; Thomson et al . , 1998 ) . Unexpect - edly , blastocyst - derived mouse ES cells exhibit a mix of molecular features consistent with the epiblast precursors in the ICM and early germ cell state in vivo , while blastocyst - derived human ES cells share deﬁning features with the postimplantation epiblast state . These results suggest that the blastocyst may serve as a source for multiple , distinct pluripotent states . We modiﬁed the classical mouse ES cell derivation conditions to test the ability of preimplantation mouse blastocysts to directly generate EpiSCs , which are normally only derived from postimplantation mouse embryos . Strain 129 blastocysts at embryonic day 3 . 5 ( E3 . 5 ) were explanted into separate wells onto a feeder layer in K15F5 medium ( see Experimental Proce - dures ) , which was optimized to support both mouse ES - like and epiblast - like pluripotent states ( Figure 1A ) . Embryos hatched from their zona pellucidae and attached to the feeder layer overnight . The ICM was allowed to outgrow for 6 days , at which time it was dissociated into small clusters and replated . By day 16 two distinct colony types predominated in the cultures : mouse ES - like ( domed ) or EpiSC - like ( ﬂat ) ( Figure 1B ) . These colonies were easily distinguished from differentiating extraembryonic cells such as trophectoderm or extraembryonic Cell Stem Cell Preimplantation Epiblast Stem Cells Cell Stem Cell 8 , 318 – 325 , March 4 , 2011 ª 2011 Elsevier Inc . 319 endoderm . The origin of the mouse ES - like and EpiSC - like colo - nies appeared to diverge early as conversion of morphology was never observed . When domed colonies were picked and individ - ually expanded by dissociation to a single cell suspension in mouse ES cell growth conditions , they could be readily propa - gated as mouse ES cell lines ( Figure 1C ) . Flat colonies exposed to the same treatments failed to expand as they did not typically survive after single cell dissociation . We were , however , able to propagate the ﬂat colonies by employing conditions developed for the growth of postimplantation - derived EpiSCs and human ES cells ( Figure 1D ) . In experiments where all media and feeder cells were identical and carefully controlled , strain 129 blasto - cysts ( n = 42 ) yielded 12 mouse ES cell lines ( 28 % ) and 11 EpiSC lines ( 26 % ) ( Figure 1E ) . In only one instance were both an EpiSC line and a mouse ES cell line derived from the same blastocyst ( shown in Figure 1B ) . These results show that both mouse ES - like and epiblast - like pluripotent states can be derived from the preimplantation blastocyst and maintained as stable cell lines . Pre - and Postimplantation - Derived EpiSCs Share DNA Methylation and Gene Expression Signatures Previous work has elucidated gene expression and epigenetic signatures that deﬁne and distinguish pluripotent states ( Tesar et al . , 2007 ) . Core pluripotency genes such as Oct3 / 4 , Nanog , and Sox2 are expressed in both mouse ES cell and EpiSC states while other , nonoverlapping sets embody one or the other state . Whileglobalgeneexpressionhasproventobeageneralindicator of pluripotent state , metastable ﬂuctuations in the mouse ES cell pluripotent stateoften blur the boundaries ( Furusawa et al . , 2004 ; Hayashietal . , 2008 ) . Forexample , Dppa3 , whichisnotexpressed in EpiSCs or human ES cells , is considered a deﬁning marker of the mouse ES cell state , but its expression is heterogeneous in mouse ES cell cultures . It is thought that the Dppa3 - negative mouse ES cells are more ‘‘epiblast - like’’ but have not been stably committed to this transition since they readily revert to Dppa3 - positive . These metastable ﬂuctuations highlight that gene expression patterns are not sufﬁcient to distinguish or deﬁne the two pluripotent states . Previous studies have established thatglobalepigeneticdifferencesexistbetweenthesetwoplurip - otentstates ( Hayashiet al . , 2008 ; Tesar et al . , 2007 ) . Thesemarks are stable and can be reliably used to ascertain cell state identity . For example , Dppa3 hypermethylation is a deﬁning mark of the EpiSC state , where , regardless of transcriptional status , Dppa3 is hypomethylated in mouse ES cells ( Hayashi et al . , 2008 ) . We tested whether preimplantation - derived EpiSCs ( E3 . 5 ) shared molecular features with preimplantation - derived mouse ES cells ( E3 . 5 ) or postimplantation - derived EpiSCs ( E5 . 5 ) . Using quantitative RT - PCR , we tested the expression of core pluripo - tency genes as well as those previously described to deﬁne the mouse ES cell or EpiSC state ( Tesar et al . , 2007 ) . Preimplan - tation - derived EpiSCs shared gene expression patterns consis - tent with postimplantation - derived EpiSCs and not mouse ES cells ( Figure 2A ) . Using Agilent microarrays , we further analyzed global gene expression patterns . Preimplantation - derived EpiSCs showed high correlation with postimplantation - derived EpiSCs and a clear distinction from mouse ES cells and other blastocyst - derived stem cells such as FAB - SCs ( Figure 2B ) . To conﬁrm these deﬁning expression patterns , we analyzed DNA methylation at the promoter region of Oct3 / 4 , a core pluripotency gene , and Dppa3 , whose methylation pattern provides one of the most reliable markers to differentiate between the mouse ES cell and EpiSC states . Bisulﬁte pyrosequencing revealed that the Oct3 / 4 promoter was hypomethylated in preimplantation - derived EpiSCs consistent with all other known pluripotent cells ( Figure 2C ) . Dppa3 however was hypermethylated in both pre - and postimplantation - derived EpiSCs while being hypomethy - lated in mouse ES cells ( Figure 2D ) . These results show that preimplantation - derived EpiSCs share molecular features with postimplantation - derived EpiSCs . Pre - and Postimplantation - Derived EpiSCs Utilize Similar Mechanisms to Regulate Pluripotency and Differentiation While the expression of speciﬁc genes provides a good indicator of cellular state , analysis of the functional regulation of pluripo - tency affords a better indicator . We ﬁrst utilized a standard assay of pluripotency by injecting preimplantation - derived EpiSCs subcutaneously into immunocompromised mice . Preimplanta - tion - derived EpiSCs readily formed teratomas consisting of a mixture of cells representing all three classical germ layers . Extensive differentiation was evident and included neural rosettes , ganglion cells , gastrointestinal epithelium , hepato - cytes , muscle , and adipocytes among others ( Figure 3A and Figure S1 , available online ) . These results show that preimplan - tation - derived EpiSCs are pluripotent . We previously identiﬁed the regulation of activin / Nodal signaling as a distinguishing characteristic of the mouse ES cell and EpiSC states ( Tesar et al . , 2007 ) . EpiSCs rely on activin / Nodal signaling to maintain the pluripotent state and when inhibited rapidly differentiate into the neurectodermal lineage . In sharp contrast , mouse ES cells do not rely on acti - vin / Nodal signaling to maintain pluripotency and its inhibition does not result in differentiation . We tested the functional regu - lation of activin / Nodal signaling in preimplantation - derived EpiSCs . In response to treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of Alk - 4 / 5 / 7 ( SB431542 ) to effectively block activin / Nodal signaling , preimplantation - derived EpiSCs rapidly downregu - lated core pluripotency genes , upregulated genes speciﬁc to the neurectodermal lineage , and formed neural rosettes by day 4 ( Figure 3B ) . This response was indistinguishable from that of postimplantation - derived EpiSCs . Further analysis of global gene expression changes in response to activin / Nodal inhibition conﬁrmed a high correlation of pre - and postimplantation - derived EpiSC lines in both the undifferentiated and the differen - tiating states ( Figure 3C ) . These results show that preimplanta - tion - derived EpiSCs are molecularly and functionally equivalent to postimplantation - derived EpiSCs . Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors Regulate the Acquisition of Distinct Pluripotent States from Preimplantation Embryos Previous studies demonstrated that the efﬁciency of deriving mouse ES cells is dependent on genetic background ( Brook et al . , 2003 ; Brook and Gardner , 1997 ; Gardner and Brook , 1997 ) . Under standard conditions , one of the only mouse strains to yield ES cell lines with an appreciable frequency is the inbred strain 129 . Interestingly , and probably not coincidentally , strain 129 is one of the only mouse strains to show a signiﬁcant and Cell Stem Cell Preimplantation Epiblast Stem Cells 320 Cell Stem Cell 8 , 318 – 325 , March 4 , 2011 ª 2011 Elsevier Inc . heritablefrequencyofpluripotent , testiculargermcelltumors ( Ste - vens and Little , 1954 ) . Most other mouse strains are refractory to both the acquisition of the pluripotent mouse ES cell state in vitro under standard conditions and the acquisition of pluripo - tent tumors within the germline . Recently , mouse ES cells were reproducibly derived for the ﬁrst time from the prototypical ‘‘nonpermissive’’ nonobese diabetic ( NOD ) strain blastocysts and through iPS cell - based reprogramming from ﬁbroblasts ( Hanna et al . , 2009 ; Nichols et al . , 2009 ) . While providing an exciting opportunity to utilize the power of mouse ES cells ( gene targeting , chimerageneration , etc . ) inthiswidelyemployedmodel , these new NOD mouse ES cells proved to be highly unstable in that they required continual stimulation of c - myc or Klf4 through inducible transgene overexpression or other exogenous means . Conversely , the isolation of EpiSCs from postimplantation mouse embryos is not dependent on strain - speciﬁc modulators . EpiSCs have been derived from a plethora of mouse strains under standard conditions . We tested the ability to isolate EpiSCs from preimplantation embryos of strains that do not readily yield mouse ES cell lines such as NOD and the consomic strain 129 - Chr18 MOLF in which the MOLF / EiJ strain chromosome 18 homozygously replaced the strain 129 chromosome 18 on an inbred 129 background ( Anderson et al . , 2009 ) . Interestingly , while failing to yield mouse ES cell lines at any appreciable Figure 2 .

These results show that strain - speciﬁc genetic elements restricting access to the mouse ES cell pluripotent state do not impact access to the EpiSC state and suggest that intrinsic genetic elements in a limited number of strains such as 129 modulate entry or stabilization of the mouse ES cell state . External signals could also modulate access to distinct plurip - otent states . In fact , recent work has shown that inhibition of both MAPK and GSK3 b ( referred to as 2i ) and activation of the Jak / Stat3 pathway via LIF can enhance the efﬁciency of mouse ES cell line derivation and allow for derivation in some previously nonpermissive strains ( Ying et al . , 2008 ) . We tested whether inhi - bition of Jak / Stat signaling , a pathway required for mouse ES cells but not EpiSCs , would alter the ability to isolate either pluripotent state . Inhibition of Jak / Stat signaling with a small molecule inhibitor of Jak resulted in a failure of strain 129 blasto - Figure 3 .

These results show that extrinsic cues can modulate the acquisition of distinct pluripotent states . Additionally , these results raise interesting questions about the lineage relationship of distinct pluripotent cell types and renews interest in the possibility that mouse ES cells could be of germ cell origin ( Zwaka and Thomson , 2005 ) ( see model in Figure S2 ) . Understanding of both intrinsic and extrinsic modiﬁers will provide critical insight into the acquisition of pluripotency ( see Figure 4 ) . In fact , a recent study has shown that simple modulation of the extrinsic signaling conditions determines whether overexpression of Oct3 / 4 , Sox2 , Klf4 , and c - myc gives rise to either iPS cells or induced EpiSCs ( iEpiSCs ) ( Han et al . , 2011 ) . Further knowledge should advance efforts to create deﬁned pluripotent cell lines , whether from embryos , somatic cells , or germ cells , and reliably control their differentiation to functional derivatives for laboratory and clinical use . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Embryos Timed natural matings were used for all experiments . Twelve hours from the middleofthedarkperiodwastermedembryonicday0 . 5 ( E0 . 5 ) . Mouseembry - onic ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) were obtained from E13 . 5 fetuses from the CF1 strain ( Charles River ) . Preimplantation blastocyst - stage embryos from 129S1 / SvImJ ( Jackson Laboratories ) , 129 - Chr18 MOLF ( Anderson et al . , 2009 ) , or nonobese diabetic ( NOD ) strains were ﬂushed from the uterine horns on E3 . 5 into FHM HEPES - buffered medium ( Millipore ) .

After 5 – 6 days the ICMs had reached a suitable size and were picked off the plate with a pulled glass pipette and incubated for 5 min at room temperature in an 8 m l drop of 0 . 25 % trypsin - EDTA . The ICMs were partially dissociated individu - ally with a pulled glass pipette . Caution was taken not to produce a completely single - cell suspension . The partial dissociates were plated individually into a 1 . 9 cm 2 well containing a feeder layer of irradiated MEFs and cultured for an additional 6 days in K15F5 medium without additional growth factor additives . At this point each culture was passaged by a brief exposure ( 2 – 3 min ) to 0 . 25 % trypsin / EDTA , inactivation of trypsin with FBS - containing MEF medium , gentle tritration to prevent complete single - cell dissociation of any pluripotent clusters , and plating into a 9 . 6 cm 2 well containing feeders in K15F5 medium . Morphologically distinct mouse ES cell and / or EpiSC colonies became evident over the next 4 – 8days ( 16 – 20total days from initial blastocystexplants ) . These colony types were separately expanded in medium designed to support either mouse ES cells or EpiSCs .

Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated with the samples overnight at 4 (cid:3) C . Samples were rinsed with PBS and incubated with the appropriate ﬂuorescently labeled Alexa secondary antibodies ( Invitrogen , 1 : 500 ) for 1 hr at room temperature . Primary antibodies used were as follows : mouse monoclonal IgG2b Oct3 / 4 ( C - 10 ; SantaCruz , 1 : 400 ) , mousemonoclonalIgG1Cdx2 ( CDX2 - 88 ; Biogenex , 1 : 50 ) , and rabbit polyclonal Blimp1 ( kindly provided by Reuben Tooze , Leeds , UK , 1 : 100 ) .

Bisulﬁte modiﬁcation of 500 ng of genomic DNA was done using the EZ DNA Methylation kit ( Zymo Research ) . Bisulﬁte converted DNA was used with gene - speciﬁc primers ( Epigendx ) to amplify promoter regions of Pou5f1 ( ASY585 ; 11 CpGs sites analyzed ) and Dppa3 ( ADS1399 ; 6 CpG sites analyzed ) using HotStar Taq polymerase ( QIAGEN ) .

Gapdh ( Mm99999915 _ g1 ) served as an endogenous control for normalization . Teratomas Blastocyst - derived EpiSCs were tested for their ability to form teratomas in immunocompromised hosts . Colonies were triturated to produce small cell clusters and cells were resuspended in Knockout DMEM supplemented with 30 % growth factor reduced Matrigel ( BD Biosciences ) at a concentration of 1 3 10 7 cells / ml . One hundred microliters of cell suspension ( (cid:1) 1 3 10 6 cells ) was injected subcutaneously into the left ﬂank of female , athymic NCr - nu / nu mice ( bred in house ; n = 4 per line ) . Tumors were allowed to develop for 4 – 8 weeks at which time they were removed and ﬁxed in 4 % paraformalde - hyde for 36 hr . Teratomas were embedded in parafﬁn , sectioned , and stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) . Expression Microarrays RNA samples were isolated and analyzed using whole - genome Agilent 4 3 44K Mouse arrays ( G4122F ) as described previously ( Tesar et al . , 2007 ) .
