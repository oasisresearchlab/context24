Brunger , Stanford University , Stanford , CA , and approved August 2 , 2011 ( received for review April 22 , 2011 ) SNARE protein - driven secretion of neurotransmitters from synap - tic vesicles is at the center of neuronal communication . In the absence of the cytosolic protein Munc18 - 1 , synaptic secretion comes to a halt . Although it is believed that Munc18 - 1 orchestrates SNARE complexes , its mode of action is still a matter of debate . In particular , it has been challenging to clarify the role of a tight Munc18 / syntaxin 1 complex , because this interaction interferes strongly with syntaxin ’ s ability to form a SNARE complex . In this complex , two regions of syntaxin , the N - peptide and the remain - der in closed conformation , bind to Munc18 simultaneously . Until now , this binary complex has been reported for neuronal tissues only , leading to the hypothesis that it might be a specialization of the neuronal secretion apparatus . Here we aimed , by comparing the core secretion machinery of the unicellular choano ﬂ agellate Monosiga brevicollis with that of animals , to reconstruct the an - cestral function of the Munc18 / syntaxin1 complex . We found that the Munc18 / syntaxin 1 complex from M . brevicollis is structurally and functionally highly similar to the vertebrate complex , suggest - ing that it constitutes a fundamental step in the reaction pathway toward SNARE assembly . We thus propose that the primordial secretion machinery of the common ancestor of choano ﬂ agellates and animals has been co - opted for synaptic roles during the rise of animals . N eurons , the building blocks of the nervous system , are highly specialized for fast information transmission , which takes place in the form of vesicular neurotransmitter release at spe - cialized junctions , the chemical synapses . Synapses evolved early in animal evolution , and relatively primitive nervous systems can be found in early branching animals , such as jelly ﬁ sh ( 1 , 2 ) . By contrast , sponges ( 3 ) or the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens ( 4 ) , appear not to be equipped with bona ﬁ de synapses , yet possess several factors related to synaptic function . Hence , it is possible that central features of synaptic transmission evolved early in animal evolution , possibly during the transition to multicellularity . Choano ﬂ agellates , a group of mostly single - celled eukaryotes that possess a single posterior ﬂ agellum surrounded by a collar of actin - based tentacles , are thought to be the closest known sister group to animals ( 5 – 8 ) . Although a long period separates the choano ﬂ agellate and animal lineages , it is possible that choa - no ﬂ agellates have remained similar to the unicellular organism from which all animals evolved ( e . g . , refs . 7 – 13 ) . However , it remains unclear which molecular mechanism of the unicellular precursor was fundamental for the development of the neuronal communication apparatus ( 14 ) ? To address this matter we focused on a key feature of syn - apses , the rapid discharge of neurotransmitter - loaded vesicles upon fusion with the presynaptic plasma membrane . In verte - brates , this process is mediated by the neurosecretory soluble NSF attachment protein receptors ( SNARE ) proteins synapto - brevin 2 , syntaxin 1 , and SNAP - 25 . Their assembly between the opposing membranes is thought to drive membrane fusion ( 15 ) . SNARE function is tightly regulated by Munc18 - 1 , a member of the conserved Sec1 / Munc18 ( SM ) protein family . In the absence of Munc18 - 1 , neurotransmitter release is blocked completely ( 16 – 18 ) ; note that the homologous factor is referred to as Rop1 in Drosophila melanogaster and Unc18 in Caenorhabitis elegans . The biochemical correlate ( s ) underlying this positive genetic role remain a matter of debate ( e . g . , reviewed in refs . 19 – 22 but see also ref . 23 ) . In brief , it has been challenging to integrate the role of a very tight Munc18 / syntaxin 1 complex , because the grip of Munc18 strongly interferes with syntaxin ’ s ability to form a SNARE complex ( 23 – 25 ) . It was therefore suggested that the Munc18 / syntaxin 1 complex is not universal but plays a special role during neuronal secretion only ( 20 , 21 , 26 , 27 ) . So far , comparative studies on the other vertebrate Munc18 isoforms , Munc18 - 2 and Munc18 - 3 , or on the Sacharomyces cerevisiae homolog Sec1 have not been able to clarify this conundrum ( 28 – 32 ) . Thus , we decided to tackle the question about the role of the tight Munc18 / syntaxin 1 complex from a new angle by comparing the workings of the homologous secretion machinery of the choano ﬂ agellate Monosiga brevicollis with that of animals . Here , we report that M . brevicollis expresses a Munc18 homolog and ﬁ nd that all three secretory SNARE proteins and Munc18 are con ﬁ ned to the apical pole . Further , the mode of interaction of Munc18 and syntaxin 1 from M . brevicollis strikingly resembles that of their animal homologs . Finally , the crystal structure of the M . brevicollis Munc18 / syntaxin 1 complex revealed that this high - af ﬁ nity interaction involves contacts between the N - peptide of syntaxin 1 and its remainder in closed conformation , as it does in the rat . This binding behavior shows that the con ﬁ guration of the Munc18 / syntaxin 1 complex was already in place in the last common ancestor of choano ﬂ agellates and animals . Results M . brevicollis Is Equipped with a Single Set of Synapse - Like Core Secretion Proteins . The genome of the choano ﬂ agellate M . brevi - collis contains a single set of secretory SNARE proteins ( 33 ) and a unique Munc18 homolog , closely related to the ones involved in regulated secretion in animals ( Fig . 1 ) .

SecretoryComponentsAreCon ﬁ ned totheApical Poleof M . brevicollis . Although choano ﬂ agellate genomes can assist in reconstructing the genetic tool kit of the common ancestor of choano ﬂ agellates and animals , their morphology may allow a glimpse at the features of the early animal cell . Indeed , striking morphological similitudes between choano ﬂ agellates and sponge choanocytes have been noted already in the middle of the 19th century ( ref . 9 ; reviewed in ref . 34 ) . The close relationship between choano ﬂ agellates and animals has been con ﬁ rmed by phylogenetic analysis ( 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 ) . Hence , studying the localization and interactions of M . brevicollis proteins could shed light on their original role . We assessed the subcellular localization of these secretory proteins in M . brevicollis by immunostaining . To this end , we raised polyclonal antibodies against the soluble region of syn - aptobrevin 1 from M . brevicollis . In addition , we found that several antibodies originally raised against the rat proteins syn - taxin 1a , SNAP - 25 , and Munc18 - 1 also speci ﬁ cally recognized their respective homologs from M . brevicollis . All four core components of the secretory machinery are con ﬁ ned to the posterior pole of the cell ( Fig . 2 A ) , a region that has been sug - gested to be involved in secretion ( 35 ) . For example , in the de - rived lineage of loricate choano ﬂ agellates , the building blocks of the lorica , so - called costal strips , are secreted within the cir - cumfence of the collar base ( 7 ) . At the ultrastructural level , the basic arrangement of organelles in M . brevicollis ( Fig . 2 B ) re - sembles the arrangement reported for other choano ﬂ agellates ( e . g . , refs . 35 and 36 ) . At the posterior pole , the single Golgi apparatus is observed beneath the nucleus , and numerous vesi - cles of 75 – 200 nm in diameter are mostly directed to the rear end of the cell , close to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 2 B , Right ) . Together these data are congruous with the notion that choa - no ﬂ agellates possess a well - de ﬁ ned secretory machinery that , while relatively simple , may have served as the raw material for the evolution of the intricate machinery found in animal cells . Conserved Properties of the Core Secretory Components of M . brevicollis . To study the interaction of the choano ﬂ agellate pro - teins directly , we expressed the proteins in E . coli . We found that the three SNARE proteins form an SDS - resistant complex ( Fig . 3 A ) , as the neuronal SNARE complex from several different animal species do ( 37 ) . The high stability of the core SNARE complex from M . brevicollis was con ﬁ rmed by circular dichroism ( CD ) spectroscopy ( Fig . 3 B ) . We next studied the interaction of the choano ﬂ agellate Munc18 with the SNARE machinery .

PNAS | September 13 , 2011 | vol . 108 | no . 37 | 15265 E V O L U T I O N quantitatively by using isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) . We found that the entire cytosolic domain of syntaxin 1 , Syx1 ( 1 - 279 ) , binds to Munc18 with high af ﬁ nity ( K d = 3 . 9 nM ; Fig . 4 and Table 1 ) . A comparable af ﬁ nity has been determined for the interaction of Munc18 - 1 and syntaxin 1a from rat ( 23 ) . In ad - dition , the interaction between Munc18 and syntaxin 1 from M . brevicollis led to an increase in intrinsic ﬂ uorescence ( Fig . S2 A ) similar to what has been observed for the rat homologs ( 23 ) , corroborating that both complexes adopt a similar con ﬁ guration ( Fig . S2 B ) . Of note , we found that rat Munc18 - 1 is able to bind to M . brevicollis syntaxin 1 , albeit with reduced af ﬁ nity ( K d = 80 nM ; Fig . S3 ) , con ﬁ rming the close resemblance of the homolo - gous pairs . Two distinct regions of syntaxin 1a are known to contribute to the interaction with Munc18 - 1 : The very N - terminal region , called the N - peptide , binds to the outer surface of Munc18 - 1 ’ s domain 1 , whereas the remainder of the syntaxin molecule in a closed conformation binds to a clamp - like structure formed by the three domains of Munc18 - 1 ( 23 ) . To test whether a similar con ﬁ guration may play a role in the interaction of Munc18 and syntaxin 1 from M . brevicollis , we generated several deletion constructs of syntaxin 1 . A syntaxin 1 variant , in which the ﬁ rst 19 residues were removed , Syx1 ( 20 - 279 ) , showed a clearly reduced af ﬁ nity to Munc18 ( K d w 64 nM ) , and a decrease in binding enthalpy ( ΔΔ H = 10 . 9 kJ / mol ; Fig . 4 and Table 1 ) . However , no binding was detected when the N - peptide alone , Syx1 ( 1 – 20 ) , was tested ( Table 1 and Fig . S3 ) . Thus , in M . brevicollis as in the rat , the N - peptide and the remaining portion of syntaxin 1 cooperate for high af ﬁ nity binding to Munc18 . We then tested binding of Munc18 from M . brevicollis to fully assembled SNARE complexes containing different syntaxin constructs . We found that Munc18 binds to the SNARE complex containing Syx1 ( 1 - 279 ) with rather low af ﬁ nity ( K d w 570 nM ; Table 1 and Fig . S3 ) , whereas no binding was detected between Munc18 and a SNARE complex containing syntaxin 1 bearing only its SNARE domain region [ Syx1 ( 200 - 279 ) ] . This ITC ex - periment indicates that in M . brevicollis , as in the rat ( 23 ) , Munc18 does not interact signi ﬁ cantly with the extended four - helix bundle SNARE complex . Crystal Structure of the Munc18 / Syntaxin 1 Complex from M . brevicollis . Altogether , our ITC analysis suggests a mode of in - teraction between Munc18 and secretory SNAREs from M . brevicollis very similar to that of the vertebrate homologs . To more precisely assess the degree of conservation , we then de - termined the structure of the complex from M . brevicollis by X - ray crystallography . The crystal structure con ﬁ rmed that two regions of syntaxin 1 , the N - peptide and the remainder in closed conformation , bind to Munc18 simultaneously ( Fig . 5 ) . Very similar to the structure of the neuronal Munc18 - 1 / syntaxin 1a complex , the N - peptide of the choano ﬂ agellate syntaxin 1 binds to the outer surface of A B Fig . 3 . The secretory SNARE proteins from M . brevicollis form a highly stable , SDS - resistant complex . ( A ) Approximately stoichiometric amounts of SNAP - 25 , syntaxin 1 , and synaptobrevin from R . norvegicus or from M . brevicollis were mixed and incubated for 3 h at RT . Without prior boiling , the secretory SNARE proteins from both species form ternary SDS - resistant complexes ( tc ) as indicated ( 37 ) . ( B ) The core SNARE complex from M . brevicollis exhibits a hysteresis in the unfolding and refolding transitions similar to the one found for the rat complex ( 41 ) . The core SNARE complex consisting of Syx1 ( 200 - 279 ) , Syb ( 1 - 75 ) , and SNAP - 25 was puri ﬁ ed by ion exchange and measured in PBS buffer , pH 7 . 4 . Unfolding of the α - helical complex occurred at T m w 80 °C ( black curve ) , whereas refolding was observable only at z 50 °C ( gray curve ) . The transitions were observed at 222 nm . Table 1 .

Munc18 domain 1 , whereas the remainder of syntaxin 1 interacts with the concave surface formed by domains 1 and 3a of Munc18 . In fact , the structures of the choano ﬂ agellate Munc18 / syntaxin 1 complex and rat Munc18 - 1 / syntaxin 1a complex can be superimposed with an overall mainchain rmsd of 2 . 0 Å . Despite the close overall similarity there is a difference to note : The linker helix between syntaxin Habc and H3 domains of M . bre - vicollis adopts a slightly different conformation than observed in the rat crystal structure . This difference in orientation can be attributed to the lack of a salt bridge between Arg142 of the Hb domain and Glu166 of the linker helix in the R . norvegicus structure ( Fig . S4 ) . This is interesting as this interaction is thought to stabilize the closed conformation of rat syntaxin 1a . Notwithstanding , syntaxin 1 from M . brevicollis adopts a closed conformation in the Munc18 / syntaxin 1 complex . M . brevicollis Munc18 Controls SNARE Assembly . For many years , it has been known that tight binding of murine Munc18 - 1 to syn - taxin 1a prevents syntaxin 1a from forming a SNARE complex ( 24 , 25 ) . Recently , we have discovered that binding of the syn - taxin N - peptide to the outer surface of Munc18 - 1 can regulate this process : When the syntaxin 1a N - peptide is bound to Munc18 - 1 , SNARE complex formation is slowed drastically , and removal of the N - peptide enables binding of syntaxin 1a to its partner SNAREs while still bound to Munc18 - 1 ( 23 ) . We therefore examined next whether this switch is present in the M . brevicollis Munc18 – syntaxin 1 interaction as well . To monitor SNARE complex assembly , we established a ﬂ uores - cence - based kinetic approach similar to the one that was in - strumental to discovering the switch for the murine proteins ( 23 ) . Indeed , when ﬂ uorescently labeled M . brevicollis synaptobrevin was mixed with SNAP - 25 and syntaxin 1 , with or without N - peptide , from M . brevicollis , an increase in ﬂ uorescence anisot - ropy corresponding to the formation of a ternary SNARE complex was observed . By contrast , premixing of Munc18 with Syx1 ( 1 - 279 ) produced an almost complete block of SNARE complex formation ( Fig . 6 A , Left ) . Remarkably , this block was not observed when Syx1 ( 20 - 279 ) was used instead ( Fig . 6 A , Right ) , demonstrating that binding of the N - peptide to Munc18 is required to block SNARE complex formation . Similar results were obtained when SNARE complex formation was monitored by SDS / PAGE ( Fig . S6 ) . Discussion It is widely accepted that zippering of SNARE proteins drives membrane fusion during neuronal exocytosis ( 15 ) . By contrast , divergent models of how Munc18 - 1 interacts with the SNARE machinery have been proposed ( 19 – 21 , 38 ) . In recent years , a model is being favored , in which SM proteins generally clasp an assembled SNARE complex . This scenario seems to reconcile con ﬂ icting evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies because it places Munc18 - 1 at a central position at which it would be able to support membrane fusion . Although the scenario is tempting , it neglects the fact that the tight Munc18 - 1 / syntaxin 1a complex interferes strongly with SNARE complex formation ( 23 – 25 ) and cannot explain how syntaxin 1 is able to escape the tight grip of Munc18 . In addition , physiological investigations support a role for Munc18 upstream of the membrane fusion reaction ( 39 ) . Despite its extraordinarily stability , it has been argued that the binary Munc18 - 1 / syntaxin 1a complex might only play a sup - porting role in neuronal secretion ( e . g . , refs . 20 , 21 , and 26 ) . The strict structural and functional conservation of the Munc18 / syn - taxin 1 complex in M . brevicollis , however , brings now to light that the binary complex must have played an important role in the last common ancestor of choano ﬂ agellates and animals and , hence , that it is not a specialization of the neuronal secretion apparatus . In fact , the binding mode with its two spatially sep - arated but linked binding sites makes the binary complex per - fectly suited for regulating an important step in the reaction cascade toward SNARE complex assembly ( Fig . 6 B ) . Probably , the primordial machinery of the common ancestor of choano ﬂ agellates and animals served as a starting point for the evolution of the more complex machinery found in animals , in particular in vertebrates . For example , we noted that a prom - inent expansion of the set of Munc18 genes took place during the evolution of vertebrates , giving rise to three different genes , Munc18 - 1 , - 2 , and - 3 . Interestingly , a comparable expansion occurred in the set of secretory SNAREs during vertebrate syntaxin 1 Munc18 domain 3b domain 3a domain 2 domain 1 N - peptide H3 domain Habc - domain linker Fig . 5 .

Domain 3 can be further subdivided into a lower half ( 3a ) and an upper half ( 3b ) . The domains of Munc18 are colored blue , green , and yellow , respectively .

The dashed line represents residues 16 – 38 of syntaxin , which were not visible in the electron density maps . Crystallographic data and re - ﬁ nement statistics are given in Table S1 . Note that the ordered region of the bound N - peptide of syntaxin 1 is slightly longer in M . brevicollis than in the Munc18 - 1 / syntaxin 1a structure .

PNAS | September 13 , 2011 | vol . 108 | no . 37 | 15267 E V O L U T I O N evolution ( 33 ) , suggesting that distinct pairs of Munc18 and se - cretory syntaxins coevolved and may have helped develop a more versatile secretion apparatus . Indeed , those novel factors are largely con ﬁ ned to different subcellular locations or their ex - pression is restricted to particular tissues or different develop - mental stages ( 15 ) . Remarkably , both rat and M . brevicollis syntaxin 1 adopt a closed conformation in complex with Munc18 . At ﬁ rst glance , Munc18 appears to lock syntaxin into a conformation that is in - compatible with SNARE complex assembly . Therefore , not sur - prisingly , it is often assumed that syntaxin ﬁ rst needs to leave the tight grip of Munc18 . Only then , according to this idea , can syn - taxin open up in preparation for SNARE complex assembly ( 19 – 21 , 38 ) . However , does syntaxin really need to escape to form a SNARE complex ? An alternative explanation supported by our ﬁ ndings is that Munc18 might merely reorganize syntaxin in such a way that its conformation is compatible with SNARE complex assembly . Note that this conformation does not necessarily re - semble the classical concept of an “ open ” syntaxin . In fact , we recently found that binding of the N - peptide to the outer surface of Munc18 - 1 is necessary for Munc18 - 1 to control the accessibility of syntaxin 1a for its SNARE partners . When syntaxin ’ s N - peptide is removed , the block is relieved , suggesting that syntaxin 1a can form a SNARE complex while still bound to Munc18 - 1 ( 23 ) . We found that this handover mechanism is also present in the ho - mologous pair from M . brevicollis , demonstrating that it con - stitutes a fundamental functional principle of these proteins . It seems therefore that Munc18 ’ s essential role is to steer syntaxin into a con ﬁ guration suited for SNARE complex assembly . How exactly this transition takes place , whether it involves a confor - mational change within the binary complex ( Fig . 6 B ) , and which other factors control this step will require further study . Experimental Procedures Protein Puri ﬁ cation . The soluble portion of synaptobrevin [ Syb ( 1 - 75 ) ] was ampli ﬁ ed by PCR from M . brevicollis cDNA . For speci ﬁ c labeling , a construct containing a cysteine at position 58 was prepared . Codon optimized version of SNAP - 25 ( 1 - 210 ) , Munc18 ( 1 - 649 ) and the soluble portion of syntaxin 1 [ Syx1 ( 1 - 279 ) ] of M . brevicollis were prepared by gene synthesis ( GenScript ) . In addition , the following truncated variants were constructed : Syx1 ( 1 - 265 ) ; Syx1 ( 1 - 242 ) ; Syx1 ( 1 - 199 ) ; Syx1 ( 20 - 279 ) , and Syx1 ( 200 - 279 ) . All constructs were cloned into a pET28a vector and expressed in E . coli . Proteins and SNARE complexes assembled from puri ﬁ ed monomers were puri ﬁ ed by Ni 2 + - NTA af ﬁ nity chromatography followed by ion - exchange chromatography essentially as described ( 23 ) . A peptide comprising the ﬁ rst 20 residues of syntaxin 1 [ Syx1 ( 1 – 20 ) ] was synthesized ( Biosyntan ) . Phylogeny . Phylogenetic reconstruction was carried out as described ( 33 ) . To gain insights into the phylogenetic placement of the core factors of the secretory machinery from the choano ﬂ agellate M . brevicollis , we included sequences from 15 animals , 7 fungi , 6 plants , and 4 protists . Detailed in - formation about the sequences and computational approaches used are given in SI Experimental Procedures . ITC . ITC was performed on a VP - ITC instrument ( GE Healthcare ) at 25 °C es - sentially as described ( 23 ) .

CD spectroscopy measurements were performed essentially as described ( 40 , 41 ) by using the Chirascan instrument ( Applied Photophysics ) . Quartz cuvettetes with a pathlength of 0 . 1 cm were used . The ellipticity at 222 nm was recorded between 20 and 95 °C at a temperature increment of 30 °C / h . Crystallization and Data Collection . For crystallization , a slightly shorter syn - taxin1construct , Syx1 ( 1 - 265 ) , wasused . Thisconstructcomprises thesyntaxin region structured in the homologous Munc18 - 1 / syntaxin 1a crystal structure , i . e . , Syx1a ( 1 - 248 ) ( 23 , 42 ) . Syx1 ( 1 - 265 ) wasfoundtobindMunc18withthesame af ﬁ nity and enthalpy as Syx1 ( aa 1 – 279 ) ( Table 1 and Fig . S3 ) . Crystals were obtained by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method by mixing equal volumes of 17 mg / mL Munc18 / Syx1 ( 1 - 265 ) complex with reservoir buffer containing 7 . 5 % PEG 6000 and 0 . 1 M Tris $ HCl at pH 7 . 0 , 4 . 25 % 2 - Methyl - 2 , 4 - Pentanediol and 15 % glycerol . After ﬂ ash - cooling in liquid nitrogen , diffraction data were collected toa resolution of2 . 8Å atSLS beamlinePX2 . Thecrystals belonged to space group P6 5 22 with lattice dimensions of a = b = 146 . 2 Å and c = 214 . 8 Å . Procedures for structure determination and re ﬁ nement are given in SI Experimental Procedures . Cell culture and Microscopy . M . brevicollis ( 50154 ; American Type Culture Collection ) were cultured in arti ﬁ cial sea water mixed with Wards cereal grass medium in a 1 : 1 ratio , adjusted to a salt concentration of 53 mS / cm and sterile - ﬁ ltered . Cultures were maintained at 25 °C and diluted 1 : 100 once a week . For immuno ﬂ uorescence , the cells were grown to a density of 10 6 to 10 7 cells / mL and ﬁ xed by adding formaldehyde to a ﬁ nal concentration of 4 % . Approximately 0 . 7 mL of the ﬁ xed culture was applied to poly - L - lysine - coated coverslips and left to sediment for 30 min . At room temperature , the coverslips were washed gently four times with PEM ( 100 mM Pipes at pH 6 . 9 , 1 mM EGTA , and 0 . 1 mM MgSO 4 ) , incubated for 30 min in blocking solution ( PEM + : 1 % BSA , 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 ) , 1 h in primary antibodies solution ( in PEM + ) , and after further washes ( PEM + ) , 1 h in the dark with ﬂ uorescent A B SNAP - 25 linker Munc18 Synaptobrevin 0 . 08 0 . 09 0 . 1 0 . 11 0 . 12 0 . 13 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 + Munc18 F l uo r e sc en c e an i s o t r op y time ( s ) time ( s ) 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 N - peptidebound N - peptide released H3 - domain Habc - domain + Munc18 Fig . 6 . Munc18 from M . brevicollis controls SNARE assembly . Synaptobrevin was labeled with Texas red at Cys58 , corresponding to Cys79 of rat synaptobrevin 2 used in our previous study ( 23 ) . Ternary SNARE complex formation was followed by the increase in ﬂ uorescence anisotropy of 50 nM ﬂ uorescent Syb1 - 75 upon mixing with 1 μ M syntaxin 1 and 3 μ M SNAP - 25 . In the absence of Munc18 , SNARE complexes for both syntaxin 1 variants , Syx1 ( 1 - 279 ) and Syx1 ( 20 - 279 ) formed ( A , black curves ) . In the presence of Munc18 ( 1 μ M ) , SNARE assembly was almost completely inhibited for Syx 1 ( 1 – 279 ) ( Left ) , but not for Syx1 ( 20 – 279 ) ( Right ) . We noted that the slowdown of SNARE complex formation in the presence of Munc18 - 1 was not found when a semiquantitative binding assay was used ( 31 ) . Therefore , it needs to be emphasized here that a kinetic approach is essential to uncover the switch mechanism , whereas binding assays , by nature , are often only suited to uncover an end - product of a binding reaction . ( B ) Schematic model of how the release of the N - peptide might set off a confor - mational change that allows binding of SNAP - 25 to the Munc18 / syntaxin 1 complex , in turn establishing a binding site for the vesicular synaptobrevin . 15268 | www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1106189108 Burkhardt et al . secondary antibodies ( 1 : 100 in PEM + , polyclonal goat anti - mouse - Cy2 , and goat anti - rabbit - Cy5 ; Jackson Immunoresearch ) and washed again four times ( PEM ) . A last 15 - min incubation in the dark with rhodamine phalloidin ( 6 U / ml in PEM ; Molecular Probes ) enabled the visualization of F - actin . After 3 washes ( PEM ) , coverslips were mounted onto slides with Fluorescent Mounting Media ( 4 μ L ; Dako ) . The following primary antibodies have been used : mouse monoclonal antibody against β - tubulin ( E7 , 1 : 200 ; De - velopmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ) ; rabbit polyclonals against M . brevi - collis synaptobrevin ( 1 : 100 ) , rat SNAP25 ( 1 : 200 ) , rat syntaxin 1 ( 1 : 200 ) , and rat Munc18 ( 1 : 200 ) . Single - plane confocal images were taken under an inverted TCS - SP2 confocal laser - scanning microscope ( Leica Microsystems ) with a 63 × ( NA 1 . 4 ) oil objective and a digital zoom factor of 6 . Confocal images from dual - labeling experiments were acquired in sequential scan - ning mode to avoid cross - talk / bleed - through between channels . For electron microscopy , cells were ﬂ ash - frozen in a Baltec HPM 010 high - pressure freezer ( Leica Microsystems ) . Cryosubstitution and embedding were performed in a Leica EM AFS as described ( 43 ) . Brie ﬂ y , specimens were sequentially in - cubated at low temperature ( − 90 °C ) in 0 . 1 % tannic acid ( 100 h ) and 2 % OsO 4 ( 7 h ) in acetone . They were progressively brought to room temperature before being embedded in Epon ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) and poly - merized 24 h at 60 °C . Ultrathin sections were cut and contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before being observed in a LEO 912 AB ( Zeiss ) . See SI Experimental Procedures for additional materials and methods .
