We first apply the measure to a classical age - stratified SIR model and observe that the recovered patterns are consistent with the age - mixing matrix that encodes the interaction of the population . We then apply the TE analysis to real data from the COVID - 19 pandemic in Spain and show that it can provide informa - tion on how the behavior of individuals changed through time . We also demonstrate how the underlying dynamics of the process allow us to build a coarse - grained representation of the time series that provides more information than raw time series . The macro - level representation is a more effective scale for analysis , which is an interesting result within the context of causal analysis across different scales . These results open the path for more research on the potential use of informational approaches to extract retrospective informa - tion on how individuals change and adapt their behavior during a pandemic , which is essential for devising adequate strategies for an efficient control of the spreading . 1 Introduction Mathematical epidemiology models are crucial for understanding the spread of infectious diseases , but they must be refined to incorporate the heterogeneities of the population . This includes factors such as the age of individuals , their socioeconomic status , mobility patterns , and even behavioral changes [ 3 ] . How - ever , these approaches can be quite demanding in terms of data , and the necessary data are often difficult and expensive to collect . For example , although epidemiological models began incorporating age as a factor as early as the beginning of the twentieth century [ 32 ] , it was not until 2008 that the POLYMOD col - laboration published the first large - scale survey to measure age - based contact patterns in the population [ 33 ] . These surveys enable the construction of age contact matrices that encode the number of contacts be - tween individuals of different age groups . However , these matrices are highly dependent on demographic , sociological , and cultural patterns of the population , making extrapolation difficult . Although measuring age contact patterns through surveys is the most direct method , it is often slow , ex - pensive , and subject to biases due to self - reporting by survey participants [ 18 ] . An alternative approach is a r X i v : 2 3 06 . 00852v1 [ phy s i c s . s o c - ph ] 1 J un 2023 An informational approach to uncover the age group interactions in epidemic spreading from macro analysis A P REPRINT 20 / 01 / 01 20 / 04 / 01 20 / 07 / 01 20 / 10 / 01 21 / 01 / 01 21 / 04 / 01 21 / 07 / 01 21 / 10 / 01 22 / 01 / 01 22 / 04 / 01 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 I n c i d e n c e p e r 10 , 000 i nh a b i t a n t s Wave 1 Wave 2 Wave 3 Wave 4 Wave 5 Wave 6 0 - 9 10 - 19 20 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 49 50 - 59 60 - 69 70 - 79 80 + Figure 1 : Incidence ( new cases ) per 10 , 000 inhabitants in Spain . Each curve represents the incidence for a certain age group , with 10 years wide brackets from 0 - 9 to 70 - 79 and one last bracket for people 80 years old or older . The Spanish government classified the propagation in 6 waves with breakpoints : [ 2020 - 01 - 01 , 2020 - 06 - 21 ] ; [ 2020 - 06 - 21 , 2020 - 12 - 06 ] ; [ 2020 - 12 - 06 , 2021 - 03 - 14 ] ; [ 2021 - 03 - 14 , 2021 - 06 - 19 ] ; [ 2021 - 06 - 19 , 2021 - 10 - 13 ] , [ 2021 - 10 - 13 , 2022 - 04 - 01 ] [ 1 , 2 ] . to use public socioeconomic data to infer these patterns , which tipically involves dividing interactions into four settings : schools , households , workplaces , and the community [ 31 ] . The number of contacts in schools and households can be estimated relatively easily using available information on their size . In contrast , workplace contacts are more difficult to determine , as only aggregated statistics are typically available . Finally , community contacts encompass all other types of interaction , such as those in public transporta - tion , shopping , social encounters , or any other random contacts . These contacts are often approximated or extrapolated from surveys carried out in similar regions [ 37 ] . However , it is important to note that these methods only provide a snapshot of the contact patterns of the population . Due to the dependence of these patterns on the demographic structure of the population , they are not static and should reflect population changes over time [ 5 ] . Additionally , these methods assume a baseline state where individual behavior remains constant . However , the recent COVID - 19 epidemic has demonstrated the significant impact that epidemics can have on human behavior , both through the propagation of the disease and as a result of non - pharmaceutical interventions implemented to control it [ 21 , 4 , 23 ] . Although surveys conducted during the pandemic period have shown significant changes in the contact patterns of the population , they are limited to specific places and times [ 45 , 24 , 13 ] . It is thus of paramount importance to devise methods that can provide retrospectively information on how individuals change and adapt their behavior during a pandemic , as it can have a huge impact on epidemic outcomes [ 36 ] . In this work , we propose an informational approach to unfold these changes in the contact patterns of the population from commonly collected surveillance data . Due to privacy concerns , publicly available data is mostly restricted to new cases ( incidence ) , hospitalization rates and deaths . Besides , these are seldom stratified beyond large regions or age groups . As such , we focus on studying the variations on the age contact patterns of the population and propose an informational approach based on transfer entropy ( TE ) quantifiers that can unfold these changes from incidence curves . Furthermore , our results show that prior knowledge on the dynamical process that created the data provide better estimates for the observable in question by coarse - graining the data . Since the methodology presented in this paper can be easily generalized to other processes beyond the context of epidemic spreading , these results also open the path for new applications of coarse - graining techniques in information theory . 2 Epidemic dynamics Our data represents the incidence per 10 , 000 inhabitants of COVID - 19 cases recorded from 2020 to 2022 in Spain [ 1 ] . The data is segmented by age groups , with each group spanning a 10 - year range , from 0 - 9 to 70 - 79 , and one last group for people 80 years old or older ( 9 groups ) . Further , the Spanish government classified the propagation in the 6 waves shown in figure 1 ( note that the surveillance system stopped 2 An informational approach to uncover the age group interactions in epidemic spreading from macro analysis A P REPRINT collecting data on a consistent basis after the 6th wave ) . We exclude the first wave from our analysis due to limitations in the surveillance system during that time period , as evidenced by seroprevalence studies indicating that the number of actual infections was likely much higher than the reported cases , and these were biased towards older age groups as they were more likely to require hospitalization [ 36 ] . The simplest model that can illustrate the impact of age - mixing patterns on the spread of COVID - 19 is the age - stratified susceptible - infected - recovered ( SIR ) model [ 45 ] . This model stratifies the population N into several age groups that interact with each other according to the age - mixing matrix M aa ′ . This matrix encodes the average number of contacts that an individual in age group a has with individuals in age group a ′ ( see figure 2 ) . Within these age groups , individuals are further classified into three groups : susceptible ( S ) , infected ( I ) or recovered ( R ) . Infected individuals may infect the susceptible population with rate β , and recover with rate γ , as shown in equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . Note that if we set M aa ′ = N a ′ / N , where N a ′ is the size of age group a ′ and N is the total population size , we would recover the classical homogeneous mixing SIR model . ˙ S a = − S a ∑ a ′ β M aa ′ I a ′ N a ′ ( 1 ) ˙ I a = S a ∑ a ′ β M aa ′ I a ′ N a ′ − γ I a ( 2 ) ˙ R a = γ I a ′ ( 3 ) where N a ′ is the number of individuals in age group a ′ and N = ∑ a N a = ∑ a S a + I a + R a . 0 - 9 1 0 - 1 9 2 0 - 2 9 3 0 - 3 9 4 0 - 4 9 5 0 - 5 9 6 0 - 6 9 7 0 - 7 9 8 0 + 0 - 9 1 0 - 1 9 2 0 - 2 9 3 0 - 3 9 4 0 - 4 9 5 0 - 5 9 6 0 - 6 9 7 0 - 7 9 8 0 + Age - mixing matrix ( Spain ) 0 2 4 6 8 10 a v e r a g e nu m b e r o f c o n t a c t s Figure 2 : Estimated age - mixing ma - trix using demographic and census data from Spain [ 31 ] . For our analysis , we will consider a multivariate time series X V = ( X Vt ) t ∈ N with the spatial index V being the vector of different age groups represented by the different colors in Fig . 1 . These time series represent the incidence per age group which corresponds to I a / N a in the SIR model . To study the dynamic relationships over time among the series , we specified them in terms of the conditional distribution of X t given its past up to order τ , denoted by X ( τ ) t = ( X t − s ) τ s = 1 . Thus , we will describe our time series data as a family of probability density kernels p from R V × N to R V [ 8 ] . To optimize the capture of the past influence of the time series we can leverage the dynamics of the trans - mission process . As individuals become infectious , they may propagate the virus to other susceptible in - dividuals until their infectivity vanishes . Thus , the number of new cases at time t will be approximately proportional to the number of individuals that are still infectious at that time : C ( t ) ∝ t ∑ s = 1 ϕ ( s ) C ( t − s ) ( 4 ) where C ( t ) is the number of cases at time t and ϕ ( s ) is the generation time [ 46 ] . The generation time is de - fined as the probability distribution function for the time from infection of an individual to the infection of a secondary case by that individual . In the SIR model the generation time is given by an exponential distri - bution with rate 1 / γ [ 43 ] . In the case of the COVID - 19 epidemic the generation time can be approximated by a gamma distribution with shape 1 . 87 and rate 0 . 27 [ 9 , 29 , 28 ] . 3 An informational approach to uncover the age group interactions in epidemic spreading from macro analysis A P REPRINT 3 Information - theoretic analysis Our analysis relies on measuring the interaction between different age groups using informational metrics , namely , transfer entropy , that shares some of the desired properties of mutual information but takes the dynamics of information transport into account [ 40 ] . Transfer - like entropies ( TEs ) have become a widely accepted measure of information transfer [ 7 ] . They are defined as the mutual information between the past of source ( s ) time - series process ( es ) and the present state of target process ( es ) , conditioned on the past of the target . Mathematically ( in discrete time ) , is written as : T X → Y ( k , l ) : = I ( X ( k ) t ; Y t | Y ( l ) t ) = E p ( x ( k ) t , y ( l ) t , y t ) (cid:34) − log p ( x ( k ) t , y t | y ( l ) t ) p ( x ( k ) t | y ( l ) t ) p ( y t | y ( l ) t ) (cid:35) . ( 5 ) Here , X ( k ) t and Y ( l ) t are random vectors representing the past influence of the processes X t and Y t up to order k and l , respectively ; the letter I represents the conditional mutual information [ 10 ] . It is also possible to condition the TE on additional processes , getting measures as multivariate transfer entropy [ 42 , 34 ] . However , we are considering that the different age groups’ influence is uncorrelated to each other in the moment of the influence . When combined with a suitable statistical significance test , the TE can be used to show that the present state of Y t is conditionally independent of the past of X t when conditioned on the past of Y t . Here , we refer to conditional independence in the statistical sense , i . e . , p ( x ( k ) , y t | y ( l ) ) = p ( y t | y ( l ) ) . 3 . 1 CMI estimator for continuous data Due to the continuous nature of our data the idea here is to directly estimate CMI by using the well - established Kozachenko - Leonenko k - nearest neighbor estimator [ 14 , 26 ] , (cid:98) I ( X ; Y | Z ) = 1 N N ∑ i = 1 [ ψ ( k XZ , i ) + ψ ( k YZ , i ) − ψ ( k Z , i ) ] − ψ ( k ) ( 6 ) where ψ is the digamma function defined as the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function ψ ( x ) = ddx log Γ ( x ) and sample length . The unique free parameter , the number of nearest - neighbors k , can be viewed as a density smoothing parameter . For large k , the underlying dependencies are more smoothed and CMI has a larger bias but lower variance , which is more important for significance testing . The decisive advantage of this estimator compared to fixed global bandwidth approaches is its local data - adaptiveness , see App . A for further details . We compute the knn - estimator using the Python library from ref . [ 44 ] . 3 . 2 Statistical Test A crucial step in the TE analysis relies on conditional independence tests ( CITs ) [ 17 ] , i . e . , determining whether the CMI is positive or not . Due to the finite sample size , the CMI estimators may produce nonzero values in the case of zero CMI , and it may even return negative values if the estimator bias is larger than the true CMI [ 38 , 25 ] . Since no theory on finite sample behavior of the CMI estimator is available , we will use a permutation - based generation of the distribution under the null hypothesis [ 17 ] . In the absence of an an - alytic solution , the null distributions are computed in a nonparametric way by using surrogate time series [ 41 ] . The surrogates are generated to satisfy the null hypothesis by destroying the temporal relationship between the source and the target while preserving the temporal dependencies within the sources [ 30 ] , see App . B for further details . 3 . 3 Coarse - grainning past influence As previously described , to facilitate the detection of the causal relationships between the incidence of dif - ferent age groups , we coarse - grain the data using the generation time distribution . To optimize the capture from the past influence of the time series we coarse - grained it weighted by a gamma distribution in the respective past window . Temporal coarse - graining can be seen as an interventional procedure , see App . C . When the intervention strategy is well - defined , this approach can eliminate micro - level confounders as well as problems associated with selection bias . 4 An informational approach to uncover the age group interactions in epidemic spreading from macro analysis A P REPRINT The maximal lag τ , the length of the time series window , is particular to the kind of data . In our case , this value can be potentially infinite , since any individual who was infected at a past point may still be infected . For practical purposes , we set τ = 10 days , for which the CDF of the Gamma distribution is over 0 . 8 . Then , we have the following mapping : X ( τ ) t (cid:55)→ X ( τ ) agg : = γ ⊺ τ X ( τ ) t , ( 7 ) where each term above represents , respectively , the random vector X ( τ ) t : = ( X t − 1 , X t − 2 , . . . , X t − τ ) and the transposed gamma vector generated as described before . With this , we aggregated the past influence in the unique random variable X ( τ ) agg . 4 Results We first look at the signal of the contact patterns that can be extracted from the TE analysis of time series data . Figure 3a shows the incidence obtained from equations ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) and the age - mixing matrix displayed in figure 2 , which uses common spreading parameters . Since the TE cannot measure a time series’ interaction with itself , figure 3b highlights the non - diagonal contribution of the age contact patterns . Figure 3c displays the TE estimated using the raw incidence curves . We observe that individuals in the 10 - 19 age group made the most significant contribution to the TE , which aligns with their higher incidence rates . Notably , the in - teraction between highly clustered age groups such as 20 - 29 , 30 - 39 , and 40 - 49 was not as clearly observable in terms of TE . We also noted that older age groups were primarily infected by groups immediately pre - ceding them , which was reasonable given their low connection rates with the rest of the population . Lastly , in figure 3d , we demonstrate that coarse - graining the same information using an exponential distribution results in a much larger TE signal . A few observations are in order . First , when we remove the age contact patterns , the transfer entropy across time series is 0 ( see figure S3 ) . This indicates that any TE larger than 0 will be related to the contact patterns of the population . Second , the assumption of independence may hamper the extraction of patterns across highly clustered age groups . Third , with the baseline behavior we observe an almost upper diagonal matrix , indicating that the spreading tends to go from the young to the old population . This is consistent with the shape of the age - mixing matrix , where the age groups with more contacts - and , hence , higher probability of getting infected - are the youngest ones . Then , interactions across groups tend to follow a cascade pattern with younger individuals interacting more with the ones immediately older than them . Thus , any deviations that we may find from this result can be associated with changes in the contact patterns of the population . A few observations are in order . Firstly , when we remove the age contact patterns , the transfer entropy across time series becomes 0 ( see figure S3 ) . This implies that any TE value greater than 0 will be related to the population’s contact patterns . Secondly , the assumption of independence may hinder the extraction of patterns across highly clustered age groups . Thirdly , with baseline behavior , we observed an almost upper diagonal matrix , indicating that spreading tends to move from younger to older populations . This aligns with the age - mixing matrix’s structure , where the youngest age groups are that interact the most , and therefore have a higher probability of infection and transmission . Interactions across age groups generally follow a cascade pattern , with younger individuals interacting primarily with those immediately older than themselves . Thus , any deviations we observe from this upper diagonal structure could be associated with changes in the behavior of the population and their contact patterns . Next , we measured the TE from incidence curves collected between 2020 and 2022 in Spain , as shown in figure 4 ( see figure S2 for the analysis without coarse - graining the time series ) . We observe substantial changes in the TE pattern for each wave . Wave 2 was the longest and characterized by the summer period in Spain , as well as the reopening of schools and universities in late September . This might have reduced children’s contribution to the spreading process , erasing the baseline pattern . Wave 3 was primarily associ - ated with the Christmas period , during which children tend to be at home and reunite with their families . Wave 4 was the smallest and marked by the vaccination of older age groups . Wave 5 corresponds to the summer of 2021 , although the start of the wave was associated to young individuals attending parties to celebrate the end of the academic year [ 27 ] . This pattern was closest to the baseline scenario . The final wave was the largest in terms of detected cases , despite having the lowest impact on hospitalization rates and deaths . It was also associated with the Christmas period , although the incidence and TE estimations differed significantly from those of the third wave . 5 An informational approach to uncover the age group interactions in epidemic spreading from macro analysis A P REPRINT 0 20 40 60 80 Timestep 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 I n c i d e n c e p e r 10 , 000 i nh a b i t a n t s ( a ) 0 - 9 10 - 19 20 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 49 50 - 59 60 - 69 70 - 79 80 + 0 - 9 1 0 - 1 9 2 0 - 2 9 3 0 - 3 9 4 0 - 4 9 5 0 - 5 9 6 0 - 6 9 7 0 - 7 9 8 0 + 0 - 9 1 0 - 1 9 2 0 - 2 9 3 0 - 3 9 4 0 - 4 9 5 0 - 5 9 6 0 - 6 9 7 0 - 7 9 8 0 + ( b ) Non - diagonal contacts 0 - 9 1 0 - 1 9 2 0 - 2 9 3 0 - 3 9 4 0 - 4 9 5 0 - 5 9 6 0 - 6 9 7 0 - 7 9 8 0 + 0 - 9 1 0 - 1 9 2 0 - 2 9 3 0 - 3 9 4 0 - 4 9 5 0 - 5 9 6 0 - 6 9 7 0 - 7 9 8 0 + ( c ) Transfer entropy on raw incidence 0 - 9 1 0 - 1 9 2 0 - 2 9 3 0 - 3 9 4 0 - 4 9 5 0 - 5 9 6 0 - 6 9 7 0 - 7 9 8 0 + 0 - 9 1 0 - 1 9 2 0 - 2 9 3 0 - 3 9 4 0 - 4 9 5 0 - 5 9 6 0 - 6 9 7 0 - 7 9 8 0 + ( d ) Transfer entropy with GT aggregation 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 a v e r a g e nu m b e r o f c o n t a c t s 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 0 . 35 0 . 40 t r a n s f e r e n t r o p y Figure 3 : Transfer entropy analysis of an age - stratified SIR model .

( c ) Transfer entropy obtained using the raw incidence . ( d ) Transfer entropy obtained with the aggregated time series over the generation time . To provide a more comprehensive view of the changes in the contact patterns of the different age groups , we measure the total TE in each direction . This way , the age group a represented by the time series X a will be a driver if the value of T X a = ∑ a ′ T X a → X a ′ is high , and a driven if T X a = ∑ a ′ T X a ′ → X a is high . In figure 5 , we rank the age groups according to these values as a function of the wave . We observe that people in the 20 - 29 age group are among the major drivers in many waves except for the 4th one . Note that this wave was the smallest one and also took place while the older age groups were being vaccinated . The age groups that are most commonly driven are those aged 0 - 9 and 70 - 79 years old . 6 An informational approach to uncover the age group interactions in epidemic spreading from macro analysis A P REPRINT 21 / 06 / 20 16 / 08 / 20 11 / 10 / 20 06 / 12 / 20 0 2 4 6 8 I n c i d e n c e p e r 10 , 000 i nh a b i t a n t s Wave 2 06 / 12 / 20 07 / 01 / 21 09 / 02 / 21 14 / 03 / 21 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Wave 3 14 / 03 / 21 15 / 04 / 21 17 / 05 / 21 19 / 06 / 21 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 Wave 4 19 / 06 / 21 27 / 07 / 21 04 / 09 / 21 13 / 10 / 21 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Wave 5 13 / 10 / 21 07 / 12 / 21 31 / 01 / 22 27 / 03 / 22 0 10 20 30 40 50 Wave 6 0 - 9 10 - 19 20 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 49 50 - 59 60 - 69 70 - 79 80 + 0 - 9 1 0 - 1 92 0 - 2 93 0 - 3 94 0 - 4 95 0 - 5 96 0 - 6 97 0 - 7 98 0 + 0 - 9 1 0 - 1 9 2 0 - 2 9 3 0 - 3 9 4 0 - 4 9 5 0 - 5 9 6 0 - 6 9 7 0 - 7 9 8 0 + 0 - 9 1 0 - 1 92 0 - 2 93 0 - 3 94 0 - 4 95 0 - 5 96 0 - 6 97 0 - 7 98 0 + 0 - 9 1 0 - 1 92 0 - 2 93 0 - 3 94 0 - 4 95 0 - 5 96 0 - 6 97 0 - 7 98 0 + 0 - 9 1 0 - 1 92 0 - 2 93 0 - 3 94 0 - 4 95 0 - 5 96 0 - 6 97 0 - 7 98 0 + 0 - 9 1 0 - 1 92 0 - 2 93 0 - 3 94 0 - 4 95 0 - 5 96 0 - 6 97 0 - 7 98 0 + 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 t r a n s f e r e n t r o p y Figure 4 : Transfer entropy analysis of the COVID - 19 pandemic in Spain .

Understanding these patterns is critical for designing effective public health interventions , and properly gauging the potential spread of an epidemic . To achieve this , we first analyzed the results of a classical age - stratified SIR model and found that the TE patterns were consistent with the age - mixing matrix . In particular , we observed that the group 10 - 19 was the major contributor to the spread of the virus , and that elder age groups tended to be infected by groups situated immediately before them due to their low number of connections with the rest of the population . 7 An informational approach to uncover the age group interactions in epidemic spreading from macro analysis A P REPRINT We then looked at the interaction between different age groups during the COVID - 19 pandemic in Spain . It is worth noting that the age - mixing matrix of Spain was inferred from public data and not directly measured through surveys [ 31 ] In addition , younger individuals were less susceptible to the infection [ 39 ] . Thus the TE between time series should differ from the baseline model . Nevertheless , the most interesting aspect is to be able to provide a reliable measure of who were the most relevant age groups in each wave and how they changed as the pandemic evolved . These findings provide valuable insights into the transmission dynamics of COVID - 19 , which can help public health authorities to adapt their response strategies to more effectively control the spread of the virus . Lastly , we have shown how knowledge of the underlying dynamics of the process allows us to build a coarse - grained representation of the time series that provides more information than the raw time series . Therefore , the macro - level representation of the process is more effective for analysis ( see also Appendix C ) . This is an interesting result in the context of causal analysis across different scales . These findings also suggest the potential for using informational approaches to retrospectively extract information on how individuals change and adapt their behavior during a pandemic . Moving forward , further research can focus on a more formal description of the relationship between the TE matrix and the age - mixing matrices used in spreading models , which may provide tools for model - free estimation of contact patterns during a pandemic . A KNN Information Estimators The k - nearest - neighbors ( knn ) are a class of estimators considered a nonparametric statistical method since can automatically adapt to any continuous underlying functions . Compared with kernel den - sity estimators ( kde ) , another nonparametric method , kNN method has some advantages . Firstly , kNN method usually require only one parameter tuning [ 25 ] , see Fig . S1 . On the contrary , kde methods usually requires adjustment of bandwidth at each dimension separately , and thus the cost of parame - ter tuning is higher than kNN method , especially when dealing with high dimensional problems [ 15 ] . Figure S1 : Adaptativeness . Also , numerical experiments suggest that for the estimation of information theoretic functionals , kNN methods can usu - ally outperform Kernel method [ 47 , 11 , 16 ] . As a result , kNN methods are widely used for nonparametric statistical prob - lems [ 25 ] . The knn estimator has as free parameter the number of nearest - neighbors k in the joint space of X × Y × Z which determines the size of hyper - cubes , ϵ i , around each ( high - dimensional ) sample point i , Fig . S1 . Then k Z , i , k XZ , i , k YZ , i are computed by counting the numbers of neighbors ( points with distance strictly smaller than ϵ i ( including the reference point i ) in the respective subspaces Z , X × Z , and Y × Z . The hy - percubes around each sample point are smaller where more samples are available . A . 1 Estimation of Entropy and Mutual Information To get the CMI estimator , we first have to derive an entropy estimator since the former can be decomposed as a linear combination of the later . Indeed , in the continuous case , where we have a distribution density p ( x , y , z ) of ( X , Y , Z ) , with the marginal densities p ( x , z ) , p ( y , z ) , and p ( z ) , we have that the conditional mutual information is I ( X ; Y | Z ) = (cid:90) p ( z ) (cid:90)(cid:90) p ( x , y | z ) log p ( x , y | z ) p ( x | z ) · p ( y | z ) dxdydz . ( 8 ) The term , h ( X ) = − (cid:90) p ( x ) log p ( x ) dx ( 9 ) 8 An informational approach to uncover the age group interactions in epidemic spreading from macro analysis A P REPRINT is called differential entropy of any random variable X with density p ( x ) . Then , Eq . 8 can also be written in terms of differential entropies , I ( X ; Y | Z ) = h ( X , Z ) + h ( Y , Z ) − h ( X , Y , Z ) − h ( Z ) . ( 10 ) If the condition Z is irrelevant , i . e . p ( x , y , z ) = p ( x , y ) p ( z ) m CMI is equal to MI , I ( X ; Y ) = h ( X ) + h ( Y ) − h ( X , Y ) . ( 11 ) For our purposes , the three time series x t , y t , and z t are considered as finite realizations of underlying stationary ergodic processes X t , Y t , and Z t , respectively [ 14 ] . Given N points { x i } drawn from the pdf p ( x ) , the expression of Kozachenko - Leonenko estimator for the differential entropy is given by [ 26 ] : (cid:98) h ( X ) = − ψ ( k ) + ψ ( N ) + ln c d x + d x N N ∑ i = 1 ln ϵ i , ( 12 ) in which ψ is the digamma function defined as ψ ( x ) = Γ ′ ( x ) / Γ ( x ) , Γ ( x ) = (cid:90) ∞ 0 u x − 1 e − u du , ( 13 ) and ϵ i is the distance from x i to its k - th nearest neighbor . The distance is defined as d ( x , x ′ ) = | | x − x ′ | | in which | | · | | can be any norm and c d x represents the volume of the corresponding unit norm ball . In order to obtain I ( X , Y | Z ) , we have to apply 12 in X × Y × Z 10 adding and subtracting , respectively , this from estimates for (cid:98) h ( Z ) , and (cid:98) h ( X , Z ) , (cid:98) h ( Y , Z ) . For these terms , we could use Eq . 12 directly with the same k . But this would imply to use different distance scales in the joint and marginal spaces X × Z , Y × Z and Z . For any fixed k , the distance to the k - th neighbor in the joint space will be larger than the distances to the neighbors in the marginal spaces . Since the effect of the bias in Eq . 12 depends on the k - th neighbor distances , the biases in (cid:98) h ( X , Y , Z ) , (cid:98) h ( X , Z ) , (cid:98) h ( Y , Z ) and (cid:98) h ( Z ) would be different and would thus not cancel . To deal with this this , we notice that in Eq . 12 we do not have to choose a fixed k when estimating the marginal entropies [ 25 , 14 ] . Assume that there are altogether k z i points within the vertical lines | | z − z i | | ≤ ϵ i , then ϵ i is the distance to the ( k z i + 1 ) - st neighbor of z i , and (cid:98) h ( z ) = − 1 N N ∑ i = 1 ψ ( k z i + 1 ) + ψ ( N ) + ln c d z + d z N N ∑ i = 1 ln ϵ i , ( 14 ) For the other subspaces this is not exactly true , i . e . , ϵ i is not exactly equal to the distance to the ( k xz i + 1 ) - st neighbor , if k xz i is defined as the number of points with max { | | x − x i | | , | | z − z i | | } ≤ ϵ i ( similar to the ( k yz i + 1 ) - st neighbor ) . Nevertheless , we can consider Eq . 14 as a good approximation ( indeed , it becomes exact when ( k xz i + 1 ) or ( k yz i + 1 ) → ∞ , and thus also when N → ∞ ) for (cid:98) h ( X , Z ) and (cid:98) h ( Y , Z ) , if we replace everywhere Z by ( X , Z ) and ( Y , Z ) in its right - hand side . If we do this , we have the estimator (cid:98) I ( X ; Y | Z ) = 1 N N ∑ n = 1 (cid:2) ψ ( k xz i + 1 ) + ψ ( k yz i + 1 ) − ψ ( k z i + 1 ) (cid:3) − ψ ( k ) ( 15 ) Note that , If we disregard the condition Z = ∅ , we have that ψ ( k z i + 1 ) = ψ ( N ) , k xz i = k x i and k yz i = k y i . This yields the estimator for MI , I ( X , Y ) = I ( X , Y | ∅ ) , as derived in [ 25 ] , (cid:98) I ( X ; Y ) = 1 N N ∑ n = 1 (cid:2) ψ ( k x i + 1 ) + ψ ( k y i + 1 ) (cid:3) − ψ ( N ) − ψ ( k ) ( 16 ) B The shuffling technique We here adopted a well - known approach in non - parametric statistics , called the permutation test . Specifi - cally , we did the following permutation test based on the null hypothesis that T X → Y = 0 : first perform M random ( temporal ) permutations of the time series X ( i ) , leaving the rest of the data unchanged ; then con - struct an empirical cumulative distribution , F ( x ) , of the estimated T X ( i ) → Y ( k , l ) ; then , given a prescribed significance level α , the observed T X → Y = c is declared significant ( i . e . , the null hypothesis is rejected at level α ) if F ( c ) > α . 9 An informational approach to uncover the age group interactions in epidemic spreading from macro analysis A P REPRINT C Temporal Effective information The idea of defining a causal effect as the effect of an intervention in the context of time series has already been discussed in literature [ 12 ] as well as theoretic - informational approaches to deal with Markov - chains - generated time series [ 20 ] . Here , we expand the later formalism to deal with non - Markovian / continuous time series . First , let’s fix some terminology . We will focus on a given space Ω , i . e . , the set of all possible occurrences . In this space , we can consider causes c ∈ Ω and effects e ∈ Ω , where we assume causes c to precede effects e , so that we also speak of a set of causes C ⊆ Ω and of effects E ⊆ Ω . We can consider the space Ω to be a state - space and c or e as states in the case of Markov chains or even discrete time - series . The set of causes and effects is related via conditional probabilities P ( e | c ) , which specifies the probability of obtaining a candidate effect e , given that a candidate causes c actually occurred . Information - based measures of causation ( interventionist formalism ) involve background assumptions in order to apply them [ 20 ] . The effect distribution given that we have intervened in the cause : P ( e ) = ∑ c ∈C P ( do ( c ) ) P ( e | do ( c ) ) ( 17 ) elucidates that there is some assumption about the distribution P ( C ) = { p ( do ( c ) ) } c ∈C to meaningfully talk about P ( e ) . This assumption is necessary because , unlike terms like P ( e | do ( c ) ) which can be stated in data , terms like P ( do ( c ) ) need to be explicitly defined ( e . g . , what is the distribution of the effects when c did not occur ? ) . To deal with this we will use distributions of interventions [ 20 ] . A distribution of intervention is a proba - bility distribution over possible interventions that a modeler or experimenter considers . That is , instead of considering a single do ( c ) operator [ 35 ] , it is a probability distribution over some applied set of them . The interventional distribution fixes P ( C ) , the probability of all causes [ 19 ] . With this in hand , we can define an informational - based causation measure for discrete finite systems , the effective information ( EI ) , EI : = I ( C ; E ) = E p ( C ) D KL (cid:0) p ( E | c ) | | P ( E ) (cid:1) , ( 18 ) where P ( E ) = ∑ e P ( e ) . As a measure of causation , EI captures how effectively ( deterministically and uniquely ) causes produce effects in the system , and how selectively causes can be identified from effects . C . 1 Causal Analysis across scales : the most effective information A causal system can be represented in different scales either at different coarse - grains or over different subsets . Each such scale ( here meaning a coarse - grain or some subset ) can be treated as a particular causal model . The full micro causal model of a system is its most fine - grained representation in space and time over all elements and states ( micro : = { S m } ) . However , systems can also be considered as many different macro causal models ( macro : = { S M } ) ) , such as higher scales or over a subset of the state - space . The set of all possible causal models , { S } , is entirely fixed by the base micro = { S m } . In technical terms this is known as supervenience : given the lowest scale of any system ( the base ) , all the subsequent macro causal models of that system are fixed . Macro causal models are defined as a mapping : M : micro (cid:55)→ macro , which can be a mapping in space , time , or both . As they are similar mathematically , here we only examine temporal mappings . One universal feature of a macroscale , in space and / or time , is its reduced size : S M must always be of a smaller cardinality than S m . By assessing EI ( S ) over all coarse grains of S m , one can ask at which level of { S } causation reaches a maximum . This provides a causation - based methodology to get the most effective scale containing more information in the relationships between the objects , expressed in bits : EI ( macro ) − EI ( micro ) ( 19 ) Thus , if EI is maximal for a macro - level rather than the micro - level , the quantity above is positive and we say that such a scale is more effective to describe the system . These principles allow us to investigate causal emergence through temporal groupings , which coarse grain micro time steps t i into macro time steps T i . A last comment is that to quantify EI ( macro ) , we have to deal with macro interventions . In causal analysis , a coarse - grained intervention is an average over a set of micro - interventions as we will clarify in the next section . 10 An informational approach to uncover the age group interactions in epidemic spreading from macro analysis A P REPRINT C . 2 Transfer Effective Information for Time - Series Data In Hoel’s approach for measuring EI across scales , no intervention is assumed to be more likely than any other based on the maximum entropy principle [ 22 ] . Perturbing using H max means intervening on some system overall n possible states with equal probability so that ( do ( c ) , ∀ c ∈ C ) . However , the measure can only be applied to Markovian systems because , in general , for non - Markovian / continuous systems the con - ditional probability distribution cannot be uniquely specified by any maximum entropy generative model [ 6 ] . A proposal to overcome this situation is instead of measuring information generated by probabilities from a hypothetical maximum entropy past state , utilizing strategies based on the empirical distribution of the past state . This gives an expression to compare the transfer effective information across scales : I macro (cid:0) X ( τ ) t ; Y t | Y ( τ ) t (cid:1) − I micro (cid:0) X ( τ ) t ; Y t | Y ( τ ) t (cid:1) . ( 20 ) Here , we are focusing on temporal coarse grainings over the past of sources and targets time series up to lag τ , X ( τ ) t and Y ( τ ) t , respectively . However , we emphasize that the idea is not restricted to it . Also , note that the EI ’s from Eq . 19 became simply mutual information due to the use of empirical distribution rather than maximum entropic distributions . Finally , note that we can formalize Eq . 7 in the main text as a macro intervention with the following strategy : do (cid:0) X ( τ ) agg = x ( τ ) agg (cid:1) : = τ ∑ T = 1 γ t − T do (cid:0) X t − T = x t − T (cid:1) , τ ∑ T = 1 γ t − T = 1 . ( 21 ) In this sense , the transfer - like quantifier , I ( X ( τ ) agg ; Y t | Y ( τ ) agg ) , ( 22 ) can be interpreted as measuring the causal impact of the macro intervention X ( τ ) agg in Y t given the knowledge of the macro intervention Y ( τ ) agg . We can measure the impact of this transfer effective information by computing the transfer entropy of the past random vector in the micro - level and taking the difference . This procedure tells us if this macro - scale intervention gives a better informative analysis . To confirm the argumentation we have that for all waves have TE macro / log 2 ( N ) > TE micro / log 2 ( n ) , see Table1 , where the division is responsable for a fair comparison among spaces with different dimension , in our case N = 3 and n = 21 . Indeed , if we compare the TE matrices from Fig . 3 with Fig . S2 we can see how the patterns disappear and all of our analysis from Sec . 4 is lost . I ( X ( τ ) t ; Y t | Y ( τ ) t ) I ( X ( τ ) agg ; Y t | Y ( τ ) agg ) 0 . 45 1 . 18 0 . 36 2 . 93 0 . 21 3 . 19 0 . 33 6 . 85 0 . 50 3 . 68 Table 1 : The first and the second columns represent , respectively , the micro and macro level TE values for all age’s groups . As we can see , all macro - level values beat the micro elucidating how this scale has a more effective analysis . D Further analysis In figure S3 , we show the results obtained when we remove the age - mixing patterns , recovering the homo - geneous mixing SIR model . Under this scenario all the incidence curves collapse on each other and the TE is 0 for all of them . 11 An informational approach to uncover the age group interactions in epidemic spreading from macro analysis A P REPRINT 21 / 06 / 20 16 / 08 / 20 11 / 10 / 20 06 / 12 / 20 0 2 4 6 8 I n c i d e n c e p e r 10 , 000 i nh a b i t a n t s Wave 2 06 / 12 / 20 07 / 01 / 21 09 / 02 / 21 14 / 03 / 21 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Wave 3 14 / 03 / 21 15 / 04 / 21 17 / 05 / 21 19 / 06 / 21 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 Wave 4 19 / 06 / 21 27 / 07 / 21 04 / 09 / 21 13 / 10 / 21 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Wave 5 13 / 10 / 21 07 / 12 / 21 31 / 01 / 22 27 / 03 / 22 0 10 20 30 40 50 Wave 6 0 - 9 10 - 19 20 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 49 50 - 59 60 - 69 70 - 79 80 + 0 - 9 1 0 - 1 92 0 - 2 93 0 - 3 94 0 - 4 95 0 - 5 96 0 - 6 97 0 - 7 98 0 + 0 - 9 1 0 - 1 9 2 0 - 2 9 3 0 - 3 9 4 0 - 4 9 5 0 - 5 9 6 0 - 6 9 7 0 - 7 9 8 0 + 0 - 9 1 0 - 1 92 0 - 2 93 0 - 3 94 0 - 4 95 0 - 5 96 0 - 6 97 0 - 7 98 0 + 0 - 9 1 0 - 1 92 0 - 2 93 0 - 3 94 0 - 4 95 0 - 5 96 0 - 6 97 0 - 7 98 0 + 0 - 9 1 0 - 1 92 0 - 2 93 0 - 3 94 0 - 4 95 0 - 5 96 0 - 6 97 0 - 7 98 0 + 0 - 9 1 0 - 1 92 0 - 2 93 0 - 3 94 0 - 4 95 0 - 5 96 0 - 6 97 0 - 7 98 0 + 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 t r a n s f e r e n t r o p y Figure S2 : Transfer entropy analysis of the COVID - 19 pandemic in Spain without coarse - graining the past influence .
