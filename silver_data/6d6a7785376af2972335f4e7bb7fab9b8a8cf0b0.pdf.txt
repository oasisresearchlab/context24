ABSTRACT The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database ( CTD ; http : / / ctdbase . org ) is a public resource that manually curates the scientiﬁc literature to provide content that illuminates the molecular mechanisms by which environmental exposures affect human health . We introduce our new chemical - phenotype module that describes how chemicals can affect molecular , cellular , and physiological phenotypes . At CTD , we operationally distinguish between phenotypes and diseases , wherein a phenotype refers to a nondisease biological event : eg , decreased cell cycle arrest ( phenotype ) versus liver cancer ( disease ) , increased fat cell proliferation ( phenotype ) versus morbid obesity ( disease ) , etc . Chemical - phenotype interactions are expressed in a formal structured notation using controlled terms for chemicals , phenotypes , taxon , and anatomical descriptors . Combining this information with CTD’s chemical - disease module allows inferences to be made between phenotypes and diseases , yielding potential insight into the predisease state . Integration of all 4 CTD modules furnishes unique opportunities for toxicologists to generate computationally predictive adverse outcome pathways , linking chemical - gene molecular initiating events with phenotypic key events , adverse diseases , and population - level health outcomes . As examples , we present 3 diverse case studies discerning the effect of vehicle emissions on altered leukocyte migration , the role of cadmium in inﬂuencing phenotypes preceding Alzheimer disease , and the connection of arsenic - induced glucose metabolic phenotypes with diabetes . To date , CTD contains over 165 000 interactions that connect more than 6400 chemicals to 3900 phenotypes for 760 anatomical terms in 215 species , from over 19 000 scientiﬁc articles . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst comprehensive set of manually curated , literature - based , contextualized , chemical - induced , nondisease phenotype data provided to the public . Key words : phenotype ; database ; curation ; chemical ; disease ; adverse outcome pathway . Since 2004 , the freely available public Comparative Toxicogenomics Database ( CTD ; http : / / ctdbase . org / ) has pio - neered novel biocuration paradigms ( Davis et al . , 2011b , 2015 ) to code , harmonize , and integrate a diverse compendium of toxi - cological ( Davis et al . , 2009 , 2011a , 2013a , 2017 ; Mattingly et al . , 2006 ) , environmental ( Davis et al . , 2008 ; Gohlke et al . , 2009 ; Planchart et al . , 2018 ) , pharmaceutical ( Davis et al . , 2013c ; Pelletier et al . , 2016 ) , and exposure data ( Grondin et al . , 2016 , 2018 ) from the scientific literature to help advance understand - ing about chemical effects on human health . CTD scientists read and manually curate information from peer - reviewed articles to transform authors’ text , tables , figures , and supple - mental files into annotated knowledge . This process , using a suite of controlled vocabularies and ontologies with accession identifiers , standardizes and organizes disparate data into a structured format , making it cohesive , manageable , and V C The Author ( s ) 2018 .

These interactions also include spe - cies information , allowing data to be analyzed across taxa , in - cluding model laboratory organisms and humans . Content is derived from 3 integrated modules : CTD’s toxicogenomic core details more than 1 . 7 million chemical - gene / protein interac - tions , disease core has over 245 000 chemical - disease and gene - disease associations , and exposure module contains over 111 000 curated statements relating environmental stressors , receptors , biomarker measurements , and outcomes . Many toxicology articles , however , do not report a disease as an endpoint ; rather , nonpathological cellular and physiological events are described as being influenced by chemicals . To cap - ture this critical data , we designed a fourth module to curate such nondisease events in a controlled manner . Here , we describe our latest project that curates chemical - induced phenotypes . Operationally , CTD distinguishes between the concepts of “disease” and “phenotype” wherein a phenotype refers to a biological outcome that is not inherently a disease . For example , smooth muscle cell migration is a phenotype while distal myopathy is a disease , decreased parathyroid hor - mone secretion is a phenotype while Barakat syndrome is a dis - ease , and abnormal blood pressure is a phenotype while idiopathic orthostatic hypotension is a disease , etc . This opera - tional distinction between phenotypes and diseases allows us to harness 2 unique controlled vocabularies ( one for phenotypes and another for diseases ) to capture both types of chemical - induced outcomes reported in the literature , with phenotype curation often providing greater molecular and biological spe - cificity ( eg , “cell migration involved in sprouting angiogenesis” and “regulation of cardiac muscle contraction by calcium ion signaling” ) compared with disease names , which often on their own provide no intuitive biological insight ( eg , Fanconi syn - drome , Arnold - Chiari malformation , Gilbert disease ) . For dis - ease curation , CTD uses the MEDIC disease vocabulary ( Davis et al . , 2012b ) ; consequently , any chemical - induced outcome that does not appear in MEDIC ( and thus cannot be curated via our disease core module ) is considered de facto to be a phenotype and instead is captured using the phenotype paradigm when possible . These phenotypes potentially provide insight to the presymptomatic biological milieu before the overt manifesta - tion of a disease , and understanding the predisease states may help elucidate the molecular and cellular backdrops to aid po - tentially in earlier clinical diagnoses and better therapeutic interventions ( Celato et al . , 2013 ; McHale et al . , 2010 ; Sakai and Otomo , 2016 ; Yu et al . , 2017 ) . Capturing chemical - induced phenotypes in a structured for - mat with controlled terms and integrating data with CTD’s ex - tensive environmental content helps address the community need to link phenotypes to the environment and make the in - formation computable ( Deans et al . , 2015 ) . Combining CTD’s chemical - gene interactions with key phenotype events , chemical / gene - disease associations , and exposure content can also generate predictive adverse outcome pathways ( AOPs ) and empower toxicologists to develop testable hypotheses about en - vironmental diseases ( Mortensen et al . , 2018 ; Nymark et al . , 2018 ; Oki et al . , 2016 ; Taboureau and Audouze , 2017 ; Villeneuve et al . , 2014a , 2014b ; Wittwehr et al . , 2017 ) . Furthermore , our unique chemical - phenotype content complements the myriad of well - established gene - phenotype systems for model organ - isms , such as the Monarch Initiative ( Mungall et al . , 2017 ) , Mouse Phenome Database ( Bogue et al . , 2018 ) , RGD PhenoMiner ( Laulederkind et al . , 2013 ) , and ZFIN ( Howe et al . , 2017 ) . Because many of these external databases use the same controlled vo - cabularies and accession identifiers for gene symbols , gene annotations , and diseases , the information can be cross - integrated to make novel computational discoveries , allowing gene - phenotype information to be brought into the chemical environment provided by CTD . MATERIALS AND METHODS Training , triaging , and curating the phenotype literature . For training , CTD biocurators were provided with a curation manual ( con - taining instructions , documentation , rules , tips , and policy issues ) and test articles for practice curation . Extensive feedback was given during early project management to ensure all biocu - rators were adequately prepared and curating in a consistent manner . CTD’s literature triaging process has been described in detail ( Davis et al . , 2011b ) . All articles curated in CTD are identi - fied using PubMed ( Agarwala et al . , 2018 ) , with chemical - centric queries to improve data completeness ( Davis et al . , 2013b ) , tar - geted journal queries to enhance data currency ( Davis et al . , 2012a ) , or exposure - themed queries for the exposure module ( Grondin et al . , 2016 ) . CTD - associated data are related to an arti - cle via its PubMed identification number ( PMID ) . Articles slated for the toxicogenomic core , disease core , and exposure modules Figure 1 . CTD phenotype curation . A , When an article reports that a chemical ( C ) inﬂuences a biological outcome , the biocurator ﬁrst determines if that out - come exists as a term in the MEDIC disease vocabulary ; if yes , then the interac - tion is curated via disease core ; if no , the interaction is curated using the GO vocabulary in the phenotype module . B , CTD biocurators leverage 8 controlled vocabularies to construct a chemical - phenotype statement that must include , at a minimum , a Chemical ( C ) , Qualiﬁer ( Q ) , Entity phenotype ( E ) , Anatomy ( A ) , Taxon ( T ) , Method ( M ) , Source ( S ) , and PubMed identiﬁcation number ( P ) . An ex - ample of terms for a chemical - phenotype statement is shown at the bottom ( and its web display is shown in Figure 2B ) . Currently , source ( S ) and method ( M ) dataare storedinternally at CTD andnot displayedon thepublicwebsite . 146 | CHEMICAL - INDUCED PHENOTYPES AT CTD are assigned to CTD biocurators on a routine basis . As articles are read for assigned projects , any reported phenotype data are curated concurrently in CTD’s chemical - phenotype module . Software engineering . CTD’s web - based Curation Tool ( CURAPP , curation application ) has been previously described ( Davis et al . , 2011b ) . CURAPP was modified to accommodate new syntax for the structured notation expressing phenotype - based chemical and gene relationships . The phenotype and anatomy vocabular - ies were integrated into CURAPP ; revised and new schematic data structures were implemented , along with new reporting and quality control - related processes and correction mecha - nisms . Existing CTD load processes were modified and new ones developed to incorporate phenotype display mechanisms . Inference engines were developed to generate gene - and chemical - based inference networks . Anatomical terms from the Medical Subject Headings ( MeSH ) “Anatomy [ A ] ” controlled vo - cabulary ( Coletti and Bleich , 2001 ) were loaded to our public database in a requisite format sufficient to support hierarchical - based anatomy searches [ similar to our existing chemical - , Gene Ontology - ( GO ) , and organism - based search features ] . Significant changes to CTD’s database schemas , including the creation of new tables , and the modification of existing tables , were necessary to accommodate the new data storage require - ments . CTD’s Public Web Application ( PWA ) was modified to implement new display , search , and associated functionality requirements . All CTD data , including phenotype data , are stored in PostgreSQL database management systems . Load pro - cesses and inference engines are Java - based and run in a Linux environment . The CURAPP and PWA utilize a J2EE - based Model - View - Controller architecture within the context of Apache / Tomcat . Data version . CTD is updated with new content on a monthly ba - sis ( http : / / ctdbase . org / about / dataStatus ) . All analyses and met - rics reported here are derived from version 15351M ( February 13 , 2018 ) . GO - slim distribution analysis . A generic GO - slim list maintained by the GO Consortium was downloaded ( http : / / www . geneontol - ogy . org / page / go - slim - and - subset - guide ) and filtered for the 69 terms in “biological _ process” category . Each phenotype term was looked up in CTD to record the number of associated chem - ical interactions . Because GO is a hierarchy , counts are sub - sumed ; thus , the number of chemical interactions represents the CTD data associated with the term directly and all child / de - scendant terms . Data analyses : leukocyte migration case study . Leukocyte data were collected from the relevant data - tabs on CTD’s page for the GO term “leukocyte migration” ( http : / / ctdbase . org / detail . go ? type ¼ go & acc ¼ GO : 0050900 ) . A Pathway View map for genes asso - ciated with “vehicle emissions” and “leukocyte migration” was retrieved using the CTD web tool icon SetAnalyzer ( http : / / Figure 2 . Accessing chemical - phenotype interactions . A , A “Gene Ontology” ( GO ) Keyword Search Box query with “leukocyte” retrieves 83 results . Clicking the pheno - type icon next to “leukocyte migration” opens up the chemical - phenotype interactions . B , The “Chemical Interactions” display is similar to other CTD pages , with data in a table format with sortable columns and hyperlinked terms that go to their respective pages in CTD . Shown is the interaction of how vehicle emissions affect the phenotype of leukocyte migration in mouse lung monocytes . The “Inference Network” lists 79 genes that have both a CTD curated interaction to vehicle emissions and , independently , have a GO - gene annotation to leukocyte migration , creating a chemical - gene - phenotype inference . Clicking the SetAnalyzer tool icon in front of the gene list generates a Pathway View map . A “Download” feature , found at the bottom of all CTD web pages , allows users to export data to their desktop in a variety of formats .

The de - fault map was manually configured ( merged edges and tree view layout ) and exported in PNG format . Genes were collected under the “Genes” data - tab and chemicals from the “Chemical Interactions” data - tab ; all results were downloaded , sorted , and filtered to unique sets for manual inspection . Data analyses : cadmium - Alzheimer’s disease case study . Information was collected from the appropriate data - tabs on CTD’s “Cadmium” page ( http : / / ctdbase . org / detail . go ? type ¼ chem & acc ¼ D002104 ) . The 131 cadmium - associated phe - notypes were derived from downloading the interactions under the “Phenotypes” data - tab and filtering the results to a set of unique terms . The 44 genes forming an Inference Network be - tween cadmium and Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) were submitted to CTD’s Batch Query ( http : / / ctdbase . org / tools / batchQuery . go ) to retrieve a list of 1 , 641 GO biological process annotations . CTD’s MyVenn tool ( http : / / ctdbase . org / tools / myVenn . go ) was used for all Venn analyses to prioritize phenotypes . Terms were manu - ally inspected for GO ancestry using the CTD PWA ( http : / / ctdbase . org / detail . go ? type ¼ go & acc ¼ GO % 3a0008150 ) and sorted to levels depending upon mappings . Subcellular level included terms mapping to “response to stimulus” ( GO : 0006954 ) , “signaling” ( GO : 0023052 ) , or “metabolic process” ( GO : 0006006 ) ; cellular level included terms mapping to “cellular process” ( GO : 0009987 ) or “cell proliferation” ( GO : 0008283 ) ; and system level included ancestry terms “system process” ( GO : 003008 ) , “developmental process” ( GO : 0001525 ) , “behavior” ( GO : 0007610 ) , “reproduction” ( GO : 0007283 ) , or other . A few terms mapped to more than one level and were assigned based upon either the level that had a preponderance of mappings or the of - ficial definition provided for the term , whichever made the most biological sense .

For this initial project , CTD was restricted to using 143 phenotype terms preselected by Pfizer from the “Phenomena and Process [ G ] ” branch of MeSH ( Coletti and Bleich , 2001 ) . In 3 months , CTD biocurators manually curated 9488 articles and generated 38 083 interactions for 2849 chemi - cals and 121 MeSH phenotypes ( Davis et al . , 2013c ) . After 2011 , CTD continued with phenotype curation as a new in - house module , but expanded the available phenotype terms by switching to the GO as a source of vocabulary terms for bio - logical outcomes . Leveraging the GO affords several advantages ( Ashburner et al . , 2000 ) . It is a robust vocabulary that provides a greater depth and broader range of terms that better reflect the multitude of outcomes reported in the toxicology literature . It is a well - known resource that is widely used by other databases in the scientific community for gene annotations . All GO terms have comprehensive definitions and stable accession identi - fiers , the latter of which allows GO annotations to act as a nexus to connect , integrate , and harmonize knowledge from domains curated across a variety of databases . For example , CTD collects and stores all the GO - gene annotations from NCBI Gene ( Maglott et al . , 2011 ) ; integration of these external GO - gene annotations with CTD’s gene - disease content provides a novel way to explore disease mechanisms based upon shared GO terms as opposed to shared gene symbols ( Davis et al . , 2016 ) . Finally , the GO vocabulary is structured as a multi - level hierar - chy , enabling users to view , navigate , and meta - analyze the as - sociated content at different levels of granularity . This hierarchy also allows GO terms to be computationally sorted into categories that differentiate subcellular events ( eg , “JNK cascade” ) from larger developmental and system level processes ( eg , “learning and memory” ) . Because of these numer - ous advantages , we transitioned to using GO as the source of phenotype terms . To reconcile our legacy MeSH - based phenotype data - set with the new GO - based phenotype content , a CTD biocurator manually mapped the initial MeSH terms to their best equiva - lent terms in GO . This mapping and translation process retained 35 538 interactions ( 93 % ) to seed the new GO - based chemical - phenotype module . Going forward , all CTD chemical - phenotype interactions use only GO as the source of nondisease term events . CTD Phenotype Curation Process When an article reports a chemical’s effect upon a disease , the information is curated via CTD’s disease core using the MEDIC disease vocabulary ( Davis et al . , 2012b ) ; any reported outcome that is not in MEDIC is considered de facto to be a phenotype and is captured using GO terms in the chemical - phenotype module where possible ( Figure 1A ) . A CTD chemical - phenotype interaction statement includes 8 types of data ( C - Q - E - A - T - M - S - P ) annotated using 8 controlled vocabularies ( Figure 1B ) , including , at a minimum : C , a chemical from the CTD Chemical Vocabulary ( Davis et al . , 2009 ) ; Q , a CTD action qualifier that reflects the direction of the interaction ( “increases , ” “decreases , ” or “affects , ” when not specified by the authors ) ; E , the entity phenotype from GO ; A , an anatomical term from the MeSH “Anatomy [ A ] ” branch ( Coletti and Bleich , 2001 ) ; T , an organism from NCBI Taxonomy ( Federhen , 2012 ) ; M , a CTD method code ( in vivo , in vitro ) ; S , the CTD information source code ( abstract , full text ) ; and P , the article identifier Figure 3 .

DAVIS ET AL . | 149 ( PMID ) from NCBI PubMed ( Agarwala et al . , 2018 ) . “Not reported” is allowed for both taxon and anatomy fields if the authors do not provide this information . CTD biocurators are careful to fo - cus on collecting chemical - induced phenotypes , and not gene - associated phenotypes ; this helps keep our resources focused on chemical - centric data and avoids duplicating gene - phenotype information that is more appropriately curated at other databases ; however , we have found that sometimes a gene needs to be included as part of a complex chemical - phenotype interaction to best reflect the authors’ intentions ; when necessary , official gene symbols from NCBI Gene ( Maglott et al . , 2011 ) are used in conjunction with the chemical and the phenotype . CTD’s practice of implementing well - established , commu - nity - accepted controlled vocabularies ( with definitions and ac - cession identifiers ) and having all manually curated interactions traced directly to the source article ensures that the information conforms with the FAIR principle , allowing the data to be Findable , Accessible , Interoperable , and Reusable ( Wilkinson et al . , 2016 ) . The data captured in this new module are wide - ranging : over 6400 chemicals and 3900 phenotypes reported in 215 spe - cies using 760 anatomy terms , manually curated from more than 19 000 articles published in 1200 scientific journals . To ex - plore the distribution of CTD phenotypes and provide a perspec - tive of the knowledge landscape covered by this module , we analyzed our curated content against the generic GO - slim list developed and maintained by the GO Consortium ( Davis et al . , 2010 ) . The GO - slim list is a summarized subset of the entire bio - logical process ontology and provides a broad , top - level view of the available information , without the detailed granular termi - nology that provides the depth and specificity to GO . The top phenotype terms curated with the most number of CTD chemi - cal interactions include cell death , general and specific meta - bolic processes ( including biosynthesis and catabolism ) , cell proliferation , response to stress , circulatory system processes , transport , and signal transduction ( Table 1 ) . Currently , CTD has curated interactions for every term in this GO - slim , except 3 ( 2 of which are processes found in plants and fungi which are taxa that CTD does not include ) . This extensive coverage of GO - slim illustrates the breadth of CTD’s phenotype content from the toxicology literature . Accessing CTD Phenotype Data Chemical - phenotype content can be accessed using the Keyword Search Box in the upper right hand corner of any CTD page by querying either the “Chemical” or “GO” field ( from the drop - down pick - list ) with a term - of - interest ( Figure 2A ) . A new data icon ( “eye , ” for phenotype ) identifies the retrieved matching terms that have chemical - phenotype associated data . Clicking the icon , or going to the “Chemical Interactions” tab on a re - spective GO page , shows all the curated chemical - phenotype interactions in a tabular web - display . Users can sort the infor - mation by clicking on any column header , and discover , for Figure 4 . Prioritizing phenotypes that connect cadmium to Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) . The “Diseases” ( top arrow ) and “Phenotypes” ( bottom arrow ) data - tabs for the chemical Cadmium ( Cd ) are depicted from CTD ( edited view ) . In the top panel , the Inference Network computes a list of 44 genes that directly interact with cadmium and also have a direct association with AD , allowing an inferred relationship ( dotted arrow ) to be made between Cd and AD : these 44 inference genes are annotated to 1641 GO terms ( by external databases ) . As well , there are 131 unique phenotypes directly associated with Cadmium ( bottom panel ) that can also be inferred to the dis - ease . A Venn analysis ( middlepanel ) reveals58 GO terms / phenotypesthat are sharedbetweenthese 2 independently deriveddata - sets ; consequently , these58 pheno - typescould beprioritizedas keyevents ( KEs ) connectingcadmiumexposureto AD . 150 | CHEMICAL - INDUCED PHENOTYPES AT CTD example , a report that exposure to vehicle emissions affects leukocyte migration of monocytes in the lungs of mice ( Figure 2B ) . Any comentioned terms ( eg , chemicals , genes , and other phenotypes ) are hyperlinked to their respective CTD pages , allowing users to easily traverse the database . In addition to the directly curated interaction between vehi - cle emissions and leukocyte migration ( Figure 2B ) , CTD also pro - vides inference networks ( Davis et al . , 2011a , 2013a , 2015 ) . In this example , there are 3 pieces of independently derived informa - tion : ( 1 ) the chemical vehicle emissions directly affects the phe - notype leukocyte migration ( from chemical - phenotype module ) , ( 2 ) vehicle emissions have effects on 79 unique genes or proteins ( from toxicogenomic core ) , and ( 3 ) independently , these same 79 genes have been ( externally ) annotated to the GO term leukocyte migration ( integrated into CTD from the NCBI Gene database ) . Thus , these 79 genes provide a potential ( in - ferred ) mechanistic link connecting vehicle emissions to leuko - cyte migration . Clicking on the SetAnalyzer tool icon diagrams an extensive gene / protein interaction module ( Figure 2B ) , quickly providing a starting point for testable molecular - genetic hypotheses for vehicle emission - induced leukocyte migration in mouse lungs . Furthermore , users can leverage additional curated content in CTD to expand the analysis . Although vehicle emissions and leukocyte migration share 79 genes , there are currently 205 genes in CTD annotated to the GO term “leukocyte migration” , providing an additional 126 genes to test for influence by expo - sure to vehicle emissions . As well , there are 471 additional chemicals ( other than vehicle emissions ) that influence leuko - cyte migration , including 68 that specifically increase this phe - notype in lung compartments of mice , including such additional traffic - related air pollutants as soot , ozone , and par - ticulate matter . Having diverse data manually curated from a variety of articles , but harmonized using controlled vocabularies in one database , helps discover information to broaden hypotheses about traffic - related exposure and immune system processes . Content also can be accessed using the Chemical - Phenotype Interaction Query page ( http : / / ctdbase . org / query . go ? type ¼ phe - notype ) . Parameters such as chemical , phenotype , anatomy , or organism can be specified and combined to perform an ad - vanced query , enabling scientists to find data specific for certain taxa or anatomical sites ( Figure 3 ) . Because many CTD curation vocabularies ( chemicals , phenotypes , anatomy , and organisms ) are hierarchical , the query returns associations for the entered term as well as all child / descendant terms , and highlights the matches in the results . Thus , a neurotoxicologist can search with just the word “brain” and immediately retrieve over 12 500 interactions for 1330 chemicals and 710 phenotypes occurring in 115 anatomical parts ( from “amygdala” to “white matter” ) for 35 organisms , whereas a user searching with “heart” will dis - cover 6100 cardiotoxic events for 910 chemicals , 420 pheno - types , and 18 structures from 21 species . Illuminating the Predisease State Using CTD’s transitive process , the curated set of chemical - phenotype interactions can be integrated with CTD’s chemical - disease associations from our disease core : if phenotype A interacts with chemical B , and , independently , chemical B is as - sociated with disease C , then phenotype A can be inferred to disease C ( via chemical B ) . These inferences generate potential biological phenotypes that may be modulated by the chemicals during the predisease / presymptomatic state . The heavy metal environmental pollutant cadmium has evidence suggesting a connection to AD ; as well , cadmium modulates 131 unique phe - notypes in CTD ( Figure 4 , top and bottom panels ) . These 131 phenotypes can be inferred to AD using the transitive process to explore potential biological reactions happening in a predisease Figure 5 . Leveraging CTD curation modules for AOP components . An adverse outcome pathway ( AOP ) is composed of ordered components ( top rows ) : the molecular initiating event ( MIE ) between a chemical and gene product launches a series of KEs resulting in an adverse outcome ( AO ) , which can have effects at the population level ( PO ) . Thesecomponentsmirrorcuration modules at CTD ( doublearrows andmiddlerow ) : toxicogenomiccore , chemical - phenotypemodule , disease core , and ex - posure module . The numbers of manually curated interactions , chemicals , genes , phenotypes , anatomy terms , diseases , and taxa ( organisms ) in each CTD module are listed ( note : theexposuremodule onlycuratesdata for humans ) . n / a , not applicable ; n / d , not determined / displayed ( data arecollected butnot yetpubliclyreleased ) . DAVIS ET AL . | 151 state . A diversity of phenotypes is seen , including the disruption of subcellular metabolic pathways ( eg , fatty acids , triglycerides , vitamin E , phospholipids , amino acids ) , cellular processes ( eg , cell cycle , mitochondrial depolarization , lymphocyte activation , testosterone secretion ) , cell death phenotypes ( eg , apoptosis , cell killing , necrosis , DNA fragmentation ) , and system level events ( eg , renal filtration , olfactory behavior , bone resorption ) . These phenotypes allow toxicologists , risk assessors , regulatory decision makers , and pharmaceutical drug scientists to explore biological events potentially preceding the clinical manifesta - tion of cadmium - induced AD . The 131 phenotypes can be prioritized by comparing them with the GO terms annotated to genes in the inference network . Currently , 44 genes form an inference network between cad - mium and AD ( Figure 4 , top panel ) . All 44 genes have curated interactions with cadmium ( from CTD’s toxicogenomic core ) , and , independently , have curated associations with AD ( from CTD’s disease core ) . These 44 genes are also annotated to 1641 unique GO biological process terms ( annotated by external GO annotators and imported into CTD via a monthly upload from NCBI Gene ) . A Venn analysis of the 1641 GO biological process terms ( derived from external , independent GO curation ) with the 131 GO - based phenotypes ( from internal CTD chemical - phenotype curation ) , reveals 58 shared terms , which , because of their derivation from 2 separate , independent data analyses , could potentially prioritize them as key events ( KEs ) connecting cadmium to AD ( Figure 4 , middle panel ) . These prioritized 58 phenotypes are annotated to 35 of the original 44 genes . Generating Predictive AOPs Integrating content from all 4 CTD curation modules ( toxicoge - nomic , chemical - phenotype , disease , and exposure ) provides an opportunity to generate predictive AOPs . An AOP is a frame - work that organizes information to construct a biologically plausible explanation for how a toxicant can result in an ad - verse outcome ( AO ) , such as a disease ( Villeneuve et al . , 2014a , b ) . AOPs are useful constructs to organize data across species , identify information gaps , and inform bioassay development ( Mortensen et al . , 2018 ; Nymark et al . , 2018 ; Oki et al . , 2016 ; Taboureau and Audouze , 2017 ; Wittwehr et al . , 2017 ) . A generic AOP framework can include 4 components : a molecular initiat - ing event ( MIE ) that links a toxicant to a gene product , followed by a series of KEs , resulting in an AO that enhances an under - standing at the population level ( PO ) . CTD’s 4 curation modules reflect these 4 AOP components ( Figure 5 ) . For cadmium and AD , the prioritized 58 phenotypes first can be sorted into arbitrary KE levels by their mapping in the GO hi - erarchy . All 58 terms ultimately map to the GO root term Figure 6 . Classifying prioritized phenotypes . The 58 prioritized phenotypes were classiﬁed to 3 key event levels : KE1 ( subcellular ) , KE2 ( cellular ) , or KE3 ( system ) based on their mapping in the GO hierarchy . Similar biological themes are coded ( legend at bottom ) . A schematic summary of the meta - data is shown in lower right corner : direct interactions between cadmium ( Cd ) and 35 genes are reported in CTD’s toxicogenomic core , and CTD’s disease core reports that these 35 genes are also directly associatedwithAlzheimerdisease , as wellas independently annotatedbyexternal databases to 58GO terms ; simultaneously , CTD’sphenotype modulereports manu - ally curated interactions between cadmium and these same 58 prioritized phenotypes ; and CTD disease core also describes a connection between cadmium and Alzheimerdisease , allowingthe58 prioritizedphenotypesto beinferred ( dottedarrow ) . 152 | CHEMICAL - INDUCED PHENOTYPES AT CTD “biological process” ( GO : 0008150 ) ; however , by mapping to their penultimate or antepenultimate root terms , the phenotypes start to segregate into different levels of biological specificity . Using this strategy , the 58 prioritized phenotypes were divided into subcellular , cellular , and system KE levels ( Figure 6 ) , and similar biological themes emerged for many GO terms ( even in different KE levels ) , such as neuron - related , cell death , oxidative stress , metabolism , cardiovascular , and mitochondrial . Many of these themes can be corroborated in the literature for AD . To wit , individually querying PubMed for abstracts that contain “AD” plus these words retrieves extensive literature - based co - occurrences for “cell death” ( 2107 articles ) , “oxidative stress” ( 3669 articles ) , “cardiovascular” ( 3327 articles ) , and “mitochondrion” ( 1432 articles ) , whereas other phenotypes may be simply coincidental ( or not yet realized ) , such as “spermatogenesis” ( only 3 articles ) . Three phenotypes were selected from the prioritized 58 ( one from each KE level ) , and used to construct a predictive AOP con - necting cadmium to AD ( Figure 7 ) . Ten independent MIEs repre - sent a curated interaction between cadmium and 10 genes ( IL1B , TNF , APP , CASP3 , PRNP , GSK3B , BAX , CRH , BDNF , and PSEN1 ) from CTD’s toxicogenomic core . Independently , these 10 genes are directly annotated to AD from CTD’s disease core . As well , these 10 genes are annotated to at least 1 of the 3 KEs as a GO - gene annotation ( from NCBI Gene ) , and all 3 KEs have been curated as interacting with cadmium from CTD’s chemical - phenotype module . Although an AOP describes a single toxicant - gene MIE , the fact that CTD’s curated content provides 10 independent MIEs converging upon repeated occurrence of the same 3 KE phenotypes evinces multiple possible lines of support for the model . It should not be construed that all 10 independent MIEs must occur for the AOP to be valid ; rather , the model simply provides at least 10 different independent ways for the AOP to be validated . Finally , an article leveraging data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) , and curated in CTD’s exposure module , con - firms a relationship between cadmium exposure and AD ( Min and Min , 2016 ) . This is just one of the several predictive AOPs that can be generated using all 35 genes and 58 prioritized phe - notypes connecting cadmium to AD . Recall that cadmium influences 131 phenotypes ( Figure 4 ) ; we only focused on the 58 that were prioritized based upon them also being annotated to genes associated with AD . This leaves an additional 73 novel phenotypes for constructing additional KEs in cadmium - induced AOPs . Similar analyses can be performed easily with any chemical in CTD . Arsenicals , for example , currently modulate over 600 distinct phenotypes ( http : / / ctdbase . org / detail . go ? type ¼ chem - acc ¼ D001152 & view ¼ phenotype ) , including 10 related to glucose metabolism ( Table 2 ) . The genes that form the inference net - works between arsenical compounds and these 10 phenotypes can be compared with known diabetic genes in CTD . In total , of the 171 unique inference genes that relate arsenicals to a glu - cose phenotype , 39 ( 23 % ) are also independently associated with diabetes ( Table 2 ) , allowing researchers to rapidly design predictive AOPs wherein arsenic interacts with the genes ( MIEs ) to affect glucose metabolism ( KE ) as potential presymptomatic phenotypes before the onset of diabetes ( AO ) . The seamless integration of CTD content allows users to ex - plore additional information , such as identifying other chemicals ( besides cadmium ) that influence “learning or memory” by view - ing the “Chemical Interactions” tab for this phenotype term Figure 7 . Integrating CTD content to generate predictive AOPs . Curated content from CTD toxicogenomic core is used to identify 10 molecular initiating events ( MIE1 - 10 ) relating the toxicant cadmiumto 10 genesthat are also directly associated with the AO of AD from disease core . CTD’s chemical - phenotype curation module ﬁlls in the intermediate KEs . Here , just 3 of the 58 prioritized phenotypes ( KE1 - KE3 ) are depicted that are directly inﬂuenced by cadmium in addition to being independently annotated to the same 10 genes by external GO databases ( dotted lines ) . Phenotypes are organized into 3 KE levels ( KE1 subcellular , KE2 cellular , and KE3 system ) to generate a predicted AOP ( bottom ) connecting cadmium to AD . Furthermore , the association of cadmium exposure to AD is conﬁrmed at the PO by CTD’s exposure module ( toparrow ) , witha U . S . studycorrelating cadmiumbloodlevels ( 0 . 39 - 1 . 14micrograms perliter ) withpatients .

Similar data extensions can be done for any of the other listed phenotypes in the cadmium - AD AOP or the 10 genes forming the MIEs . This helps discover and connect information to grow and extend the predictive AOPs , as well as interrelate other AOPs to generate testable hypotheses about chemical exposures and environmentally influenced dis - eases . The predictive AOPs easily generated from CTD curated content should help toxicologists review , test , and refine AOPs for official approval ( https : / / aopwiki . org / ) .
