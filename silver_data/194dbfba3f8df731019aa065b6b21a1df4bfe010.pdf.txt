This need is intensified when dental / craniofacial applications are considered . As a result , new products are continuously being researched and developed . Approximately six million bone fractures with bone loss occur in the United States each year . 1 This loss of bone in long bone fracture or den - tal procedures requires the use of some type of bone graft . Bone graft choices can be autograft , allograft , processed from natural materials , synthetic , or any combination of these with or without other biological agents or materi - als . Collagraft ® bone graft substitute , PRO - DENSE ® , the MASTERGRAFT ® family of products , and STRUCSURE ™ CP will be the products discussed herein . The chapter will address the reasons for the composite approach of CONTENTS 3 . 1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 41 3 . 2 Collagraft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 42 3 . 3 PRO - DENSE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 42 3 . 3 . 1 General Information and Indications . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 42 3 . 3 . 2 Physical / Mechanical / Degradation Properties . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 43 3 . 3 . 3 Biological / Preclinical Studies . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 47 3 . 3 . 4 Clinical Studies . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 49 3 . 4 MASTERGRAFT Family of Products . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 49 3 . 4 . 1 General Information and Indications . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 49 3 . 5 STRUCSURE CP Cement . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 55 3 . 5 . 1 General Information and Indications . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 55 3 . 5 . 2 Physical / Mechanical / Degradation Properties . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 56 3 . 5 . 3 Biological / Preclinical Study . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 59 3 . 6 Summary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 59 Acknowledgements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 60 References . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 60 D o w n l oaded B y : 1 0 . 3 . 98 . 93 A t : 10 : 46 05 J u l 2019 ; F o r : 9781315363530 , c hap t e r 3 , 10 . 120 1 / 9781315363530 - c h3 42 Translating Biomaterials for Bone Graft these bone graft materials to help highlight their advantages for clinical use . The chapter goal is to acquaint the reader with some background and engi - neering for these representative bone graft composites . 3 . 2 Collagraft Collagraft bone graft substitute was an early bone graft composite of col - lagen and hydroxyapatite developed and commercialized by Zimmer and Collagen Corporation . Collagraft was developed to partially simulate the major components in bone : collagen and hydroxyapatite . Collagraft received approval to market in 1993 by the U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) through a Premarket Approval application . 2 , 3 Collagraft bone substitute is a composite of type 1 bovine dermal fibular collagen and a biphasic calcium phosphate ceramic , with each individual granule containing separate micro - domains of hydroxyapatite ( HA ) and tricalcium phosphate ( TCP ) phases of a calcium phosphate ceramic . Collagraft created a combination of materials that were similar to bone and could have cells or other osteogenic materi - als / agents added to this synthetic graft . 4 The combination of collagen with fast and slow degrading bioceramics presents a bone graft scaffold that allows for new bone formation . 1 Multiple preclinical and clinical studies for bone graft repair reported the successful use of this bone graft composite with various biological agents and / or materials . 4 – 6 Collagraft was the initial approved composite bone graft substitute and thus laid a developmental out - line for subsequent bone graft substitute composites . It was the first compos - ite bone grafting material containing both a calcium phosphate ceramic and a collagen binder . Previous bone - grafting products were just loose ceramic granules while Collagraft’s formulation provides a stable matrix for cells to attach to and deposit new bone within . Collagraft is no longer marketed / distributed through Zimmer ; it is currently marketed / distributed through NeuColl , Inc . ( Campbell , CA ) . 3 . 3 PRO - DENSE 3 . 3 . 1 General Information and Indications Calcium sulfate ( CS ) has been used successfully as a bone void filler for over 120 years , but there have been reports of sterile effusion theorized to be due to the rapid dissolution of CS in vivo . 7 The osteogenic activity of each com - ponent combined with the crystalline phase - dependent dissolution rates ( cal - cium sulfate > brushite > β - tricalcium phosphate ) produce a novel resorbable D o w n l oaded B y : 1 0 . 3 . 98 . 93 A t : 10 : 46 05 J u l 2019 ; F o r : 9781315363530 , c hap t e r 3 , 10 . 120 1 / 9781315363530 - c h3 43 Ceramic Composites for Bone Graft Applications bolus for the encouragement of a material - assisted therapy aimed at “creeping - substitution” bone healing . In comparison , products based on various calcium phosphate minerals have been shown to be osteoconductive and biocompat - ible , but often exhibit extremely slow in vivo dissolution profiles that prevent complete regeneration of bone . The injectable , in situ curing PRO - DENSE Bone Graft Substitute ( Wright Medical Technology , Inc . , Memphis , TN ) cement has been engineered such that the physiochemical and osteoconductive proper - ties of calcium sulfate and calcium phosphates are utilized in a complimen - tary manner which results in notable rates of osteogenesis within bone voids . The bone graft composite material is marketed in sterile kits which contain two vials ( a precursor powder / β - tricalcium phosphate granule blend compo - nent and an aqueous liquid component ) , a vacuum mixing apparatus , and a syringe / Jamshidi ® needle for minimally invasive delivery to a bone defect site . 8 By mixing the liquid and powder / granule components , two cement reac - tions are initiated and allowed to proceed in unison , forming a calcium sulfate dihydrate ( gypsum ) and calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate ( brushite ) matrix encompassing a distributed phase of β - tricalcium phosphate granules ( see reaction formulas at the end of this section ) . 9 , 10 While in the preset paste form , the material can be syringe - loaded and injection - delivered via a large gauge needle ; here , it can conform to defect site boundaries and harden in situ . Ultimately , after placement , the cured cement is a triphasic blend of calcium salts formed to the shape of a bone void . The cured product is a composite cement blend on a microscopic scale , largely consisting of gypsum with a lesser brushite component incorporating β - tricalcium phosphate granules ( see Figure 3 . 1a ) . 10 Granules are mechanically incorporated chemically through the involvement of surface reactions with the brushite system , locking them into the phosphate matrix . An underlying dogma of composite science is to utilize the beneficial properties of multiple materials in a concerted effort such that in combination the resultant exhibits multifunctional and improved proper - ties over those of the individual constituents , and such synergistic effects have been exhibited by PRO - DENSE as a bone void filler medical device . Calcium sulfate hemihydrate to calcium sulfate dihydrate ( gypsum ) reaction : 2 ( CaSO 4 · ½ H 2 O ) + 3H 2 O → 2 ( CaSO 4 · 2H 2 O ) Monocalcium phosphate monohydrate and beta - tricalcium phosphate to calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate ( brushite ) reaction : Ca ( H 2 PO 4 ) 2 · H 2 O + 3 Ca 3 ( PO 4 ) 2 + 7H 2 O → 4 ( CaHPO 4 · 2H 2 O ) 3 . 3 . 2 Physical / Mechanical / Degradation Properties The dissolution profile of PRO - DENSE’s components combined with their microscopic structural integration appears to result in a mechanically supported dynamic structure in vivo , resulting in a resorption profile D o w n l oaded B y : 1 0 . 3 . 98 . 93 A t : 10 : 46 05 J u l 2019 ; F o r : 9781315363530 , c hap t e r 3 , 10 . 120 1 / 9781315363530 - c h3 44 Translating Biomaterials for Bone Graft that greatly accommodates the multiple phases of osteogenesis across fractures , voids , and surgically created gaps . The fundamental steps asso - ciated with bridging such a defect have been generally described as over - lapping stages of inflammation , repair , and remodeling . 11 The triphasic composition of PRO - DENSE has been shown to demonstrate tiered dis - solution kinetics in vitro as faster dissolving calcium sulfate is released leaving behind a highly porous , slower resorbing calcium phosphate structure , which largely retains the original overall geometry of the initial set cement . Figures 3 . 1 and 3 . 2 show the results of an accelerated dissolu - tion study in distilled water . ( a ) As Cast ( b ) Day 4 ( c ) Day 8 ( d ) Day 12 FIGURE 3 . 1 Exemplary micrographs of PRO - DENSE’s staged dissolution profile are shown . Cast cylin - ders ( 3 . 3 x 4 . 8 mm OD ) were exposed to an accelerated in vitro dissolution protocol using distilled water . Representative specimens at time points 0 , 4 , 8 , and 12 days ( frames a , b , c , and d , respectively ) were withheld from further treatment for electron microscopy and electron dispersive spectroscopy processing ( plastic embedded , polished , and cross - sections scanned ) . High - density β - tricalcium phosphate granules ( white aggregate ) can be seen throughout the continuous , composite matrix of gypsum ( CaSO4 · H2O ) and brushite ( CaHPO4 · 2 ( H2O ) ) ( light grey ) in frame a . Consecutive frames ( b - d ) demonstrate the phosphate - and sulfate - staged dis - solution of the composite . Note that as the faster dissolving sulfate component is dissolved , a highly porous yet structural osteoconductive brushite cement / β - tricalcium phosphate granule scaffold is left behind . Complete resorption of the material can be inferred through observa - tion that the slowest dissolving granule / brushite components demonstrate an ever - reducing cross - sectional area with treatment time ( a through d ) . 17 D o w n l oaded B y : 1 0 . 3 . 98 . 93 A t : 10 : 46 05 J u l 2019 ; F o r : 9781315363530 , c hap t e r 3 , 10 . 120 1 / 9781315363530 - c h3 45 Ceramic Composites for Bone Graft Applications Mass loss was measured as a function of time in vitro for cast pellets of PRO - DENSE , pure calcium sulfate , and pure calcium phosphate materials . 10 At selected time points , pellets were embedded in plastic , cross - sectioned , and polished to assess the morphology . 10 The early , more rapid dissolution kinetics of the calcium sulfate may harness the early stages of repair in which neovas - cularization penetrates and high - collagen - level woven bone is throughout a defect site in an inward - working fashion . The later , slower dissolution kinet - ics of the remaining phosphate compounds may support biomaterial - assisted remodeling of the immature bone through both osteoblast - assisted mineraliza - tion of woven bone to a high mechanical integrity state . Also , osteoclast - assisted resorption and dissolution of the final implant material will occur later . This theory of assisting in staged healing is supported by preclinical in vivo canine studies using critically sized defects , where histology identified bone cells and tissue types incorporated within the partially resorbed material . 12 PRO - DENSE has resulted in a statistically significant increased healing rate over that of auto - graft and pure calcium sulfate in critical defects based on biomechanical and histological findings ( see Table 3 . 1 and Figures 3 . 3 and 3 . 4 ) . 12 0 0 20 40 60 80 100 10 20 30 Days in vitro M a ss r e m a i n i n g : % 40 50 60 PRO - DENSE CSD Calciplex FIGURE 3 . 2 Results from an accelerated in vitro dissolution protocol are shown . Percent mass loss with time as a result of dissolving into distilled water has been monitored for pure calcium sulfate , pure calcium phosphate , and the composite PRO - DENSE material . PRO - DENSE’s ( diamond ) tiered dissolution profile is demonstrated through comparison with faster dissolving pure calcium sulfate ( CSD—square ) and slower dissolving pure tricalcium phosphate ( Calciplex— triangle ) . The composite nature of PRO - DENSE results in an extended yet ever - dissipating mass . Note—Continued monitoring of specimen masses was halted upon approaching steady state ( PRO - DENSE’s approach to complete dissolution ) . Calciplex was a blend of α - and β - tricalcium phosphate . It may be assumed that a majority of the α - tricalcium phosphate phase transformed to hydroxyapatite in the aqueous environment of the study , resulting in the 20 % mass retention . 10 D o w n l oaded B y : 1 0 . 3 . 98 . 93 A t : 10 : 46 05 J u l 2019 ; F o r : 9781315363530 , c hap t e r 3 , 10 . 120 1 / 9781315363530 - c h3 46 Translating Biomaterials for Bone Graft TABLE 3 . 1 Biomechanical Tensile Test Data of Cored Trabecular Bone Specimens Are Presented .

At 13 weeks , defects treated with PRO - DENSE demonstrated advanced healing over the auto - graft group based on a significant increase in ultimate compressive strength over the autograft group ( p = 0 . 004 ) . The increase in strength over that of normal bone seen for the PRO - DENSE groups decreased with time after 13 weeks , and biomechanical properties approached that of normal bone at a later 26 - week time point . 12 D o w n l oaded B y : 1 0 . 3 . 98 . 93 A t : 10 : 46 05 J u l 2019 ; F o r : 9781315363530 , c hap t e r 3 , 10 . 120 1 / 9781315363530 - c h3 47 Ceramic Composites for Bone Graft Applications Such defects model highly compromised nonunion fractures , where treat - ment can be very challenging . 12 These studies , in combination with the known healing cascade , are suggestive of the potential benefit PRO - DENSE offers over more traditional , single - component bone graft substitutes which resorb through linear kinetics via an “outside - in” fashion , such as that of Wright Medical’s comparatively faster resorbing pure calcium sulfate bone graft substitutes . The bulk materials of the composite PRO - DENSE demon - strate comparatively slower resorption , such as found in commercially avail - able hydroxyapatite cements . 13 , 14 Clinical complications have been associated with the faster resorbing materials ; sterile exudates and delayed mineraliza - tion have been noted within the literature . 15 , 16 3 . 3 . 3 Biological / Preclinical Studies Supplementing the passive , yet favorable , nature of PRO - DENSE’s mul - tiphase dissolution in vivo is the bioactive phenomenon of a well - orchestrated relationship between protein adsorption and desorption on PRO - DENSE R Autograft 10× 39× FIGURE 3 . 4 Plastic embedded , ground , and H & E stained section histology images are shown of canine proximal humerus critically sized defects treated with PRO - DENSE ( left ) and autograft ( right ) at the 13 - week time point . PRO - DENSE images show increased new bone formation within the defect site in comparison to the remodeled defect of the autograft - treated site . A minor amount of PRO - DENSE material continues to be resorbed and can be seen as the dark material ( gypsum / brushite ) encompassing consolidated white material ( β - tricalcium phosphate gran - ules ) . Note the osteoconductivity of the PRO - DENSE material as new bone is well incorporated throughout the defect site and in contact with the highly porous matrix , which results from PRO - DENSE resorption . 12 D o w n l oaded B y : 1 0 . 3 . 98 . 93 A t : 10 : 46 05 J u l 2019 ; F o r : 9781315363530 , c hap t e r 3 , 10 . 120 1 / 9781315363530 - c h3 48 Translating Biomaterials for Bone Graft the material’s surface and the beneficial cellular activities that emanate on and are adjacent to the composite cement as a result of these dynamic pro - cesses . In vitro protein adsorption / desorption studies have demonstrated that osteogenesis - related chemotactic agents , angiogenic factors , and dif - ferentiation factors exhibit a higher affinity for PRO - DENSE versus pure calcium sulfate . Bone morphogenetic protein - 2 ( BMP - 2 ) and vascular endo - thelial growth factor ( VEGF ) have demonstrated preferential absorption onto the surface of PRO - DENSE over pure calcium sulfate . 17 Preservation of protein functionality has been demonstrated through release of absorbed VEGF from PRO - DENSE’s surface . PRO - DENSE specimens exposed to VEGF - containing buffer solutions for various times passively desorbed protein into fresh solutions where chemotactic bioactivity was shown to be retained in vascular endothelial cells ( see Figure 3 . 5 ) . The novel addition of calcium phosphate cement and granules with calcium sulfate cement results in a more bioactive composite over calcium sulfate alone and may explain the enhanced tissue healing response associated with PRO - DENSE over that of pure calcium sulfate and autograft treatment seen in preclini - cal canine models . 12 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 24 hr 48 hr PRO - DENSE HUVEC migration M i g r a t e d c e ll s ( × 1 , 000 c e ll s / m L ) Positivecontrol Negativecontrol 72 hr FIGURE 3 . 5 Chemotaxis results ( average cell count and standard deviation ) from an in vitro study in which human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) migrated through transwell plate filters are shown , demonstrating PRO - DENSE’s angiogenic potential . PRO - DENSE demonstrated the ability to sustain release of VEGF over a 72 - hour period in vitro , inferring absorption of the protein as well . VEGF - containing eluates , derived from a protein absorbtion / desorption pro - tocol from PRO - DENSE surface , were used for the experimental conditions shown . Desorption was allowed for the times shown ( 24 , 48 , and 72 hours ) .

S . clinics since its FDA marketing approvals in 2007 as a bone void filler and a core decompression material for the osteonecrotic femoral head . 18 , 19 Clinical studies have largely reported positive findings with use of the injectable graft . In retrospective studies , a 24 patient population with benign primary bone tumors was successfully treated with PRO - DENSE . 20 , 21 In 21 of 24 patients bone void repair was achieved with early return to load bearing activity . 20 , 21 There were two tumor recurrences and one infection in this small series after wound break - down events . 20 , 21 Another large retrospective study on PRO - DENSE’s treatment of benign tumors was conducted by Fillingham , et al . where 56 patients’ records were reviewed with a high degree of treatment benefit . In this study , the following adverse events were observed : three recurrences ( success - fully treated through an additional administration of PRO - DENSE or curet - tage ) , two post - op fractures ( treated through closed technique ) , and two cases of wound complications that did not require graft retrieval . 22 Backfilling of the surgical site and replacement of the necrotic bone space in hip core decom - pression surgeries was prospectively evaluated by Civinini et al . The treat - ment of 37 enrolled patients’ hips revealed the following clinical observations : a statistically significant increase in average Harris hip score ( 68 to 86 ) , either radiographic improvement or the absence of further collapse in 29 ( 78 . 4 % ) of these hips , and disease progression to the stage that arthroplasty was required in three hips . 23 These mostly successful clinical experiences with the use of PRO - DENSE reflect positive effects that can be achieved with the innovative design of this composite bone graft substitute . Collectively , the aforementioned work illustrates PRO - DENSE to be a novel composite from material and biologic perspectives , and a biomaterial with a unique blend of physiochemical and bioactive functionality that has proven efficacious in the treatment of clinically demanding bone voids . 3 . 4 MASTERGRAFT Family of Products 3 . 4 . 1 General Information and Indications In the United States , the MASTERGRAFT family of products includes MASTERGRAFT Granules , MASTERGRAFT Mini Granules , MASTERGRAFT Putty , MASTERGRAFT Strip , and MASTERGRAFT Matrix EXT . The Granules ( diameter 1 . 6 – 3 . 2 mm ) and Mini Granules ( diameter 0 . 5 – 1 . 6 mm ) are biphasic calcium phosphate ( BCP ) ceramic bone void fillers composed of 85 % beta - tricalcium phosphate ( β - TCP ) and 15 % hydroxyapatite ( HA ) by mass . 24 , 25 This ratio falls within the range described in the literature as an optimal ratio for use in vivo . 26 – 28 These ceramic granules have an interconnected porous structure that facilitates bone ingrowth . 29 The Putty , Strip , and Matrix EXT D o w n l oaded B y : 1 0 . 3 . 98 . 93 A t : 10 : 46 05 J u l 2019 ; F o r : 9781315363530 , c hap t e r 3 , 10 . 120 1 / 9781315363530 - c h3 50 Translating Biomaterials for Bone Graft products are composite materials that combine the BCP ceramic granules with bovine type I collagen .

MASTERGRAFT Putty contains BCP particles ( diameter 0 . 5 – 1 . 6 mm ) uni - formly distributed throughout bovine type I collagen for enhanced han - dling characteristics . 32 , 33 The collagen is a combination of 70 % insoluble fibrous collagen and 30 % soluble collagen . 29 Putty is supplied dry and becomes moldable when hydrated with autogenous bone marrow aspirate or sterile water . 32 , 33 FIGURE 3 . 9 MASTERGRAFT Putty .

Strip and Matrix EXT are similar to Putty in that they contain BCP ceramic particles ( diameter 0 . 5 – 1 . 6 mm ) dispersed throughout bovine type I collagen ; however , all of the collagen is insoluble and the mineral : collagen ratio is increased compared to that of Putty . 34 , 35 This formulation allows the products to be both flexible and compression - resistant . The ability to resist compression by the surrounding tissue and muscles maintains space at the defect site , facilitating complete bone healing in challenging applications such as posterolateral spine arthrodesis . Additionally , the geometry ( 2 . 0 cm wide , 0 . 6 cm thickness , and 10 cm or 36 cm lengths ) and flexible nature of Strip allows a single implant to span multiple spinal levels . For instance , the 36 - cm - long Strip can be used to fill the bony voids associated with scoliosis reconstructions . ( a ) ( b ) FIGURE 3 . 11 ( a and b ) SEM images of MASTERGRAFT Strip .

If desired , autograft bone can be used in conjunction with the MASTERGRAFT products . 24 , 25 , 32 – 35 In rabbit posterolateral fusion studies , MASTERGRAFT Strip and Putty were successfully used as auto - graft extenders . 36 , 37 The advantage of these composites is that the addition of collagen to the BCP granules yields products with improved handling char - acteristics and reduces the possibility of granule migration from the defect site . The MASTERGRAFT family of products provides options for surgeons when selecting the proper bone void filler ( Table 3 . 2 ) . 3 . 5 STRUCSURE CP Cement 3 . 5 . 1 General Information and Indications STRUCSURE CP cement from Smith & Nephew Inc . ( Memphis , TN ) is an injectable , self - setting bone graft substitute that incorporates hydroxypro - pyl methylcellulose ( HPMC ) into the formulation . This polymer / ceramic formulation allows greatly improved mixing and handling characteristics . FIGURE 3 . 14 MASTERGRAFT Strip .

This improved rheological behavior allows the cement to be mixed and delivered from the syringe . The addition of a gun to hold the syringe allows a simple , one - handed delivery system . 3 . 5 . 2 Physical / Mechanical / Degradation Properties Calcium phosphate cements are useful materials to replace or augment bone loss in orthopedic surgery . 38 Traditionally , these materials have required the materials engineer to balance a range of competing properties in the formula - tion selection . For example , increasing the viscosity of the cement to improve its injectability would also significantly decrease the set time of the final product . Early injectable cement systems had a viscosity that was initially very low and would increase with time as the setting reaction progressed . This would make the injection inconsistent throughout the delivery of the product . The initial , low viscosity of the product ( similar to water ) would make it difficult for the injected material to stay in place when injected . As the curing reaction progresses , the viscosity of the cement increases allow - ing the cement to be used ; eventually , the viscosity becomes too high and the cement is no longer injectable . In some cases , this can result in the material setting before it can be injected . Another common issue with early products was a phenomenon called “filter press , ” which is a form of phase separation of the liquid and powder ingredients during mixing . 39 This can prematurely plug the tip of the syringe , thus preventing full use of the product . By moving to a composite system , the trade - offs of a simple powder - liquid system were greatly changed , allowing for improved products to be developed . The components of the STRUCSURE CP cement system are TABLE 3 . 2 The MASTERGRAFT Family of Products Product Composition Description of Composite Indication MASTERGRAFT Granules and Mini Granules Biphasic calcium phosphate ( BCP ) granules N / A Oral / maxillofacial bony tissue + bony voids or gaps of the skeletal system MASTERGRAFT Putty BCP granules + collagen ( 70 % insoluble , 30 % soluble ) Malleable Oral / maxillofacial bony tissue + bony voids or gaps of the skeletal system MASTERGRAFT Strip and Matrix EXT BCP granules + insoluble collagen Flexible and compression resistant Bony voids or gaps of the skeletal system D o w n l oaded B y : 1 0 . 3 . 98 . 93 A t : 10 : 46 05 J u l 2019 ; F o r : 9781315363530 , c hap t e r 3 , 10 . 120 1 / 9781315363530 - c h3 57 Ceramic Composites for Bone Graft Applications shown in Figure 3 . 15 . The inclusion of the polymer provides a more con - sistent viscosity throughout the injection of the cement . This is shown in Figure 3 . 16 , which illustrates the force required to deliver STRUCSURE from a 10 mL syringe as a function of displacement . The test was conducted at a rate of 1 mm / min . FIGURE 3 . 15 Components of the STRUCSURE CP delivery system . Top : Cannula . Middle : Mixing syringe pre - loaded with the powder and liquid components .

The force required to inject the cement is almost constant until the end of the syringe is reached at ~ 25mm displacement . 40 D o w n l oaded B y : 1 0 . 3 . 98 . 93 A t : 10 : 46 05 J u l 2019 ; F o r : 9781315363530 , c hap t e r 3 , 10 . 120 1 / 9781315363530 - c h3 58 Translating Biomaterials for Bone Graft The graph in Figure 3 . 16 shows an almost constant injection force for the cement , even though the setting reaction is ongoing . The cohesion of the material is also improved as the polymer acts to hold together the powder as it reacts and cures . These improved rheological and cohesive properties also allow the cement to stay in place , allowing the surgeon to have great control over the location of the material . This also allows the cement to be drilled and hardware ( e . g . , screws ) to be inserted into the cement before it is fully cured . 41 The improved cohesion of the cement means it will not fracture or sag when a hole is drilled into the material ( Figure 3 . 17 ) . Figure 3 . 18 shows a cross - section of the cement after placement of hardware through the cement . Finally , the water - soluble polymer will dissolve out of the cement in the first few days after implantation ; this space vacated by the polymer will be replaced with the patient’s extracellular fluids ( interstitial fluid and blood plasma ) . This inclusion of extracellular fluids improves the biocompatibility and osteoconductivity of the implanted cement . FIGURE 3 . 18 Sectioned Sawbone after insertion of hardware through cement .

The performance of the STRUCSURE material was evaluated through radiologi - cal scoring and histological analysis , including measuring the percentage of bone in the defect at 4 and 8 weeks post - operatively . In all of these mea - sures , the performance of the tested cement was compared to morselized autograft , the gold standard in scaffolds for bone regeneration . In this study , the STRUCSURE CP material behaved similarly to the autograft group . The STRUCSURE CP material was statistically equivalent to autograft in all mea - sures at all time points apart from the amount of bone formed at 4 weeks as measured from the radiographs . No inflammatory response was seen in any of the animals . A micro - CT image of the treated defect , at 8 weeks , is shown in Figure 3 . 19 . 3 . 6 Summary With this chapter , several bone graft composites were discussed , while out - lining the reasons for their composite approach . The clinical need for bone graft in musculoskeletal and dental / craniofacial applications continues to expand . Composite approaches to bone grafting , while currently clinically successful , may offer improved bone restoration outcomes in the future with further scientific and technical refinements .
