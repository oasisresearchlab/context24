Stop propagating the learning styles myth Paul A . Kirschner a , b a Open University of the Netherlands , Valkenburgerweg 177 , 6419AT Heerlen , The Netherlands b University of Oulu , Oulu , Finland a r t i c l e i n f o Article history : Available online 19 December 2016 a b s t r a c t We all differ from each other in a multitude of ways , and as such we also prefer many different things whether it is music , food or learning . Because of this , many students , parents , teachers , administrators and even researchers feel that it is intuitively correct to say that since different people prefer to learn visually , auditively , kinesthetically or whatever other way one can think of , we should also tailor teaching , learning situations and learning materials to those preferences . Is this a problem ? The answer is a resounding : Yes ! Broadly speaking , there are a number of major problems with the notion of learning styles . First , there is quite a difference between the way that someone prefers to learn and that which actually leads to effective and ef ﬁ cient learning . Second , a preference for how one studies is not a learning style . Most so - called learning styles are based on types ; they classify people into distinct groups . The assumption that people cluster into distinct groups , however , receives very little support from objective studies . Finally , nearly all studies that report evidence for learning styles fail to satisfy just about all of the key criteria for scienti ﬁ c validity . This article delivers an evidence - informed plea to teachers , administrators and researchers to stop propagating the learning styles myth . © 2016 Elsevier Ltd .

In 2013 , I published an article in Educational Psychologist with my good friend and colleague Jeroen van Merri € enboer entitled “ Do learners really know best ? Urban legends in education ” . In this article we discussed a number of urban legends which permeate teaching and education such as learning styles , the digital native , multitasking , the learning pyramid , and so forth . Based upon a Tweet of mine relating to an article in Computers & Education , its editors approached me in the following way : On 18th August , you tweeted the following : “ Scienti ﬁ c journal ' Computers & Education ' publishes learning styles bull ! When will editors stop this absurdity ? ” . This was related to the recent paper by [ Author et al . ] on learning styles [ URL ] in our journal . We believe that the readers of our journal will be interested in a more detailed scrutiny of learning styles which is why we want to ask you to write an Invited Comment on this topic .

Computers & Education 106 ( 2017 ) 166 e 171 The gist of my criticism of learning styles is that there is no real scienti ﬁ c basis for the proposition ( actually it should be relegated to the realm of beliefs ) that ( 1 ) a learner actually has a certain optimal learning style , ( 2 ) ( s ) he is aware of what that personal learning style is and / or there is a reliable and valid way to determine this style , and ( 3 ) optimal learning and in - struction entails ﬁ rst determining this learning style and then aligning instruction accordingly . The assumption that lies at the basis of learning styles is that teachers , trainers , instructional designers , instructional developers , etcetera should take the learning style that ( 1 ) learners say that they have or ( 2 ) any of a number of speci ﬁ c instruments ( e . g . , learning styles inventories ) determine the learner to have into account when designing , developing , and delivering instruction . If this is done , will it be possible to optimally facilitate learning and allow the learner to fully develop her - / himself and achieve optimal learning outcomes . While this idea seems intuitively appealing and sounds as if it has a certain degree of face validity , there are fundamental dif ﬁ culties in both diagnosing learning styles and aligning instruction to these styles . In the rest of this Comment I will try to make clear what these problems are . In our article ( Kirschner & van Merri € enboer , 2013 ) we ﬁ rst posited that learning styles poorly classify ( actually pigeon - hole ) learners . Most of the styles that have been ‘ determined ’ are based on types ; the learner is not assigned to a style based on a set of scores on different dimensions , but rather is classi ﬁ ed into a speci ﬁ c e often exclusive e group ( see Cassidy , 2004 ; Cof ﬁ eld , Moseley , Hall , & Ecclestone , 2004 for an overview of learning styles ) . The ﬁ rst problem here is that people cannot simply be clustered into speci ﬁ c and distinct groups as is shown in a number of studies ( see , for example Druckman & Porter , 1991 ) . Most differences between people on whatever dimension one might think up are gradual and not nominal . Even the clas - si ﬁ cation sex / gender which has , until recently , been considered dichotomous has been shown to be quite more nuanced than that . Proponents of using learning styles tend to disregard this and use arbitrary criteria such as a median or a mean on a certain scale to assign a person to a speci ﬁ c style . With respect to this simple pigeon - holing of learners , Barbara Prashnig ( 2005 ) who could be considered to be a proponent of learning styles and who is a developer of learning styles instruments , writes that in one of the most complex and detailed learning styles instruments on the market [ the Learning Style Analysis ( LSA ) ] there are at least 49 different elements … [ with ] . . . intricate style combinations enhanced by degrees of needs ranging from strong pref - erences to ﬂ exibilities to non - preferences . Given those many style components … it is not possible to label learners by just selecting one style feature as the predominant one . ( p . 2 ) As to the number of pigeon - holes that have been created , Cof ﬁ eld et al . ( 2004 ) write that “ the sheer number of di - chotomies in the literature conveys something of the current conceptual confusion ” ( p . 136 ) . In their review , they refer to 30 different dichotomous learning styles in the literature 2 ( see Table 1 ) . The second problem has to do with the validity , reliability and predictive powers of the learning styles tests being used . Stahl ( 1999 ) reported inconsistencies and low reliabilities for the measurement of learning styles ; when individuals complete a particular measurement at two different points in time . In other words , the test - retest reliability is quite low . This is also related to the information often used to assess learning styles . The most often used method is self - report . Unfortunately , the adequacy of self - report for assessing a learning style is highly dubious ( see , for example , Veenman , Prins , & Verheij , 2003 ) . The reason for this is that learners are either not able and / or not willing to truthfully report what they do or what they think that they do . To illustrate the unreliability of self - report , Rawson , Stahovich , and Mayer ( 2016 ) asked students when they did their homework and how long they worked on it . They also gave these students a ‘ smartpen ’ which noted when and how long they worked on their homework . While there was a signi ﬁ cant positive correlation between the amount of time students ' spent on their homework and the students ' course grade as measured by the smartpen ( r ¼ 0 . 44 ) , there was no signi ﬁ cant correlation between the course grade and time spent on homework as reported by the students ( r ¼ (cid:2) 0 . 16 ) . In other words , there was no real correlation between subjective self - report and objective measurement . Also , nearly all students greatly over - reported their homework time ( 88 % of the students ) . Finally , Massa and Mayer ( 2006 ) found that when students re - ported their preference for verbal information as opposed to visual information , this preference was only weakly related to their actual abilities when they were objectively measured ( i . e . , their spatial ability ) . Also , the self - reported preferred way of learning is often a bad predictor of the way people learn most effectively ; what people prefer is not , per de ﬁ nition , what is best for them . Knoll , Otani , Skeel and Van Horn ( 2016 ) conclude learning styles are associated with subjective aspects of learning but not objective aspects of learning . In other words , the question arises as to whether learners actually “ know ” what is best for them . Clark ( 1982 ) published a watershed meta - analysis with respect to learner preference for choosing a certain type of instruction and found that the reported preference was most often e at best e not correlated to what and how much was learnt or was actually negatively correlated . In other words , those learners who said that they preferred a particular way of learning typically did not learn better or actually even performed worse when it was used . He termed the latter mathemathantic 3 ( from the Greek roots mathema ¼ a study where something is learned þ thanatos ¼ death ) ; that is , an instructional method that on the one hand matches the way that the learner say to 2 If there are ‘ only ’ 30 dichotomous variables which can apply to learners , then there are 2 30 ( 2 to the 30 th power ) different combinations of these 30 dichotomous styles which means that there are at least 1 , 073 , 741 , 824 different learning styles . If we only count children here ( estimated at 2 billion ) , this means one style for every two children . 3 Ernst Rothkopf had earlier ( 1970 ) ( Rothkopf , 1970 ) , coined the term mathemagenic activities ( gigneshai ¼ to be born ) which he de ﬁ ned as those learning activities which cause or give birth to learning . P . A . Kirschner / Computers & Education 106 ( 2017 ) 166 e 171 167 prefer for learning but which is unproductive or harmful to her / his learning ( Clark , 1989 ) . In such situations , a compensatory or even a remedial model of instruction ( see Salomon , 1971 as well as Berliner & Cahen , 1973 when they discuss Trait - Treatment Interactions ) is probably a better approach as it ‘ prescribes ’ an approach that can compensate for the unwanted effects of a particular disposition or preference ( van Merri € enboer , 1990 ) . To put it in a different context , while most people prefer sweet , salty , and / or fatty foods , I think we can all agree that this is not the most effective diet to follow , except if the goal is to become unhealthy and overweight . With respect to the reliability and validity of determining a person ' s learning style , Cof ﬁ eld et al . ( 2004 ) reviewed the 13 most often used instruments for determining learning styles with respect to minimal psychometric criteria , namely internal consistency , test - retest reliability , construct validity , and predictive validity ( see Table 2 ; in their report Table 44 ) . Table 2 Thirteen learning styles models / instruments matched against minimal criteria . ( Cof ﬁ eld et al . , 2004 ; the references to the instruments can be found in this report ) . Table 1 30 Learning Styles discussed in Cof ﬁ eld et al . ( 2004 ) . (cid:3) convergers vs . divergers (cid:3) verbalisers vs . imagers (cid:3) holists vs . serialists (cid:3) deep vs . surface learning (cid:3) activists vs . re ﬂ ectors (cid:3) pragmatists vs . theorists (cid:3) adaptors vs . innovators (cid:3) assimilators vs . explorers (cid:3) ﬁ eld dependent vs . ﬁ eld independent (cid:3) globalists vs . analysts (cid:3) assimilators vs . accommodators (cid:3) imaginative vs . analytic learners (cid:3) non - committers vs . plungers (cid:3) common - sense vs . dynamic learners (cid:3) concrete vs . abstract learners (cid:3) random vs . sequential learners (cid:3) initiators vs . reasoners (cid:3) intuitionists vs . analysts (cid:3) extroverts vs . introverts (cid:3) sensing vs . intuition (cid:3) thinking vs . feeling (cid:3) judging vs . perceiving (cid:3) left brainers vs . right brainers (cid:3) meaning - directed vs . undirected (cid:3) theorists vs . humanitarians (cid:3) activists vs . theorists (cid:3) pragmatists vs . re ﬂ ectors (cid:3) organisers vs . innovators (cid:3) lefts / analytics / inductives / successive processors vs . rights / globals / deductives / simultaneous processors (cid:3) executive , hierarchic , conservative vs . legislative , anarchic , liberal P . A . Kirschner / Computers & Education 106 ( 2017 ) 166 e 171 168 They conclude that three of the models did not meet any of the four criteria ( Jackson ; Riding ; Sternberg ' s multiple in - telligences ) , four met only one criterion ( Dunn & Dunn ; Gregorc ; Honey & Mumford ; Kolb ) , three met two criteria ( Entwistle ; Herrmann ; Myers - Briggs personality type indicator ) , two met three criteria ( Apter , Vermunt ) and only one met all four criteria ( Allinson & Hayes cognitive style indicator ) , but this instrument measured cognitive styles and not learning styles . We concluded in our ( Kirschner & van Merri € enboer , 2013 ) article , When designing instruction that takes differences between learners into account , one should assess cognitive abilities rather than preferred learning styles because abilities are better predictors of how people learn most effectively . Moreover , these cognitive abilities should be objectively measured on an ordinal scale and in an objective way , rather than by subjective self - reports that are used to assign people to types on the basis of one or more arbitrary criteria . ( p . 6 ) As a thought experiment , let ' s disregard all of the dif ﬁ culties just discussed in relation to measuring and determining learning styles , and then ask how should we tailor instruction to the preferred or determined learning styles . Here , the learning - styles hypothesis ( Pashler , McDaniel , Rohrer , & Bjork , 2009 ) is important , namely that a crossover interaction ( see Fig . 1 ) will be found in which a speci ﬁ c type of learner learns signi ﬁ cantly better with an instructional method tailored to her / his learning style , whereas a different speci ﬁ c type of learner ( i . e . , a learner with an opposing learning style ) learns better with an instructional method tailored to her / him . For example , according to this hypothesis , verbal learners will learn best when they are taught through verbal instructional methods ( e . g . , when they are given a book or an article to read ) , but perform miserably when given a video to watch . In contrast , visual learners will learn best when they are taught through visual instructional methods ( e . g . , when they are asked to watch a video ) , but perform miserably when given a book to read . Important here is that it is not suf ﬁ cient that a statistically signi ﬁ cant interaction is found between a certain style and a certain method . Only real crossover in - teractions can be used to con ﬁ rm the learning - styles hypothesis . Taking this all into account , the question arises whether there are suf ﬁ cient studies reporting robust crossover interactions between style and method , regardless of whether a preferential , remedial , or compensatory model forms the basis for the interactions . Unfortunately for the adherents of learning styles , this is not the case ( see Cof ﬁ eld et al . , 2004 ; Pashler et al . , 2009 ; Rohrer & Pashler , 2012 ) . Pashler et al . ( 2009 , p . 105 ) conclude that “ at present , there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning - styles assessments into general educational practice . Thus , limited education resources would better be devoted to adopting other educational practices that have a strong evidence base , of which there are an increasing number ” . In contrast , a number of well - designed recent studies contradict the learning - styles hypothesis . Pashler et al . ( 2009 ) stated that good research investigating learning styles should take three steps into account : 1 . Start by examining the purported learning style of the respondents in the study Rogowsky , Calhoun , and Tallal ( 2015 ) , for example , examined visual versus auditory learning styles . Fig . 1 . Crossover interaction . P . A . Kirschner / Computers & Education 106 ( 2017 ) 166 e 171 169 2 . Participants must then be randomly allocated to groups with half receiving instruction speci ﬁ cally matching their learning style and the other half instruction matching the opposite style ( e . g . , visual learners in one group are required to read , while visual learners in the control group are required to listen ) . 3 . All participants need to take the exact same test . When taking these three steps into account , Constantidinou and Baker ( 2002 ) , for example , found no relation between having a purported visual learning style and the learning of verbal items either presented in a visual or an auditory way . Massa and Mayer ( 2006 ) also found nothing to support the idea that different instructional methods , emphasising either pictorial or verbal information , were of bene ﬁ t e in a crossover manner e to visualizers and verbalizers respectively . Similar negative results are have been found for other learning styles . In medical education , Cook , Thompson , Thomas , and Thomas ( 2009 ) found no support the premise for working either from problems to theory ( i . e . , using an inductive leaning approach ) or from theory to problems ( i . e . , using a deductive learning approach ) , would lead to better learning for sensing / concrete learners and intuitive / abstract learners respectively . Finally , Rogowksy , Calhoun , and Tallal ( 2015 ) found no statistically signi ﬁ cant relationship between the preference for a particular learning style ( i . e . , auditory , visual word ) and learning ( i . e . , listening comprehension , reading comprehension ) . And the list of research showing that the learning styles emperor has no clothing is exhausting . What follows are two interesting quotes from the large corpus of learning styles research : From Morrison , Ross , Kalman , and Kemp ( 2011 , p . 59 ) “ Despite the extensive literature on learning styles , questions remain regarding the degree to which such styles can be matched to teaching methods with any bene ﬁ ts to learning ( Knight , Halpin , & Halpin , 1992 ; Park & Lee , 2004 ; Snow , 1992 ) . ” From Dembo and Howard ( 2007 , p . 107 ) “ … learning style instruments have not been shown to be valid and reliable , there is no bene ﬁ t to matching instruction to preferred learning style , and there is no evidence that understanding one ' s learning style improves learning and its related outcomes … We urge instructors to reconsider their instructional practices , especially the advice they give students about learning styles , and base their practices on sound research . ” To ﬁ nish , what follows is four conclusions that can be made with respect to learning styles and learning styles research : 1 . The premise that there are learners with different learning styles and that they should receive instruction using different instructional methods that match those styles is not a ‘ proven ’ fact , but rather a belief which is backed up by precious little , if any , scienti ﬁ c evidence . 2 . There are a lot of very fundamental problems regarding measuring learning styles . 3 . The theoretical basis for the assumed interactions between learning styles and instructional methods is very thin . 4 . Signi ﬁ cant empirical evidence for the learning - styles hypothesis is almost non - existent . On another note , Cof ﬁ eld et al . ( 2004 ) state that the concept of learning styles is so ill de ﬁ ned that it is effectively useless for instruction . Wheeler ( 2011 ) summed this up as follows , “ Probably the only reason some teachers ( and many training organisations ) hang on to the idea of testing learning styles is that it is convenient to do so , and that to ditch the idea altogether would leave them having to work harder with students . ” . To this I can only add that if and when teachers say that they have proof that using learning styles works , the ‘ proof ’ that they give is primarily anecdotal . According to Rosenthal and Jacobson ( 1992 ) what they see and / or experience , is most probably because when teachers expect enhanced performance from their students , the performance is enhanced . This is known as the Pygmalion or the Rosenthal effect where higher expectations lead to an increase in performance . Rosenthal argues that such biased expectancies affect reality and create self - ful ﬁ lling prophecies . Related to this , Reiner and Willingham ( 2010 ) state : … learning - styles theory has succeeded in becoming “ common knowledge . ” Its widespread acceptance serves as an unfortunately compelling reason to believe it . This is accompanied by a well - known cognitive phenomenon called the con ﬁ rmation bias . When evaluating our own beliefs , we tend to seek out information that con ﬁ rms our beliefs and ignore contrary information , even when we encounter it repeatedly . When we see someone who professes to be a visual learner excel at geography and an auditory learner excel at music , we do not seek out the information which would disprove our interpretation of these events ( can the auditory learner learn geography through hearing it ? Can the visual learner become better at music by seeing it ? ) ( np ) Newton ( 2015 ) found that the overwhelming majority ( 89 % ) of recent research papers e with the date range July 23 , 2013 to July 23 , 2015 e listed in the ERIC and PubMed research databases , implicitly or directly endorsing the use of learning styles in higher education . We want to urge ourselves as scientists to get our act together . Howard - Jones ( 2014 ) , reporting on a study he conducted with Dekker , Lee , Howard - Jones , & Jolles 2012 found that 95 % of teachers in Great Britain , The Netherlands , Turkey , Greece , and China held the belief that “ [ I ] ndividuals learn better when they receive information in their preferred learning style ( for example , visual , auditory or kinaesthetic ) ” We are progenitors and gatekeepers of new knowledge . What we study and / or publish can and should make an impact on both the scienti ﬁ c world in which we travel and the world of education which we serve . As such , it is our solemn duty to carry out research and report on good science e independent of positive signi ﬁ cant results e and guard against the spreading of P . A . Kirschner / Computers & Education 106 ( 2017 ) 166 e 171 170 pseudoscience , myths , and outright lies . There is no bene ﬁ t to be gained by adapting and designing education and instruction to these so - called styles . Actually , in line with the mathemathantic effects of preferred approaches to instruction , it may even be the case that if this is done , administrators , teachers , parents and even learners are negatively in ﬂ uencing the learning process and the products of education and instruction . With this in mind , I feel it necessary e and even our duty e as re - searchers and / or journal editors and reviewers not to propagate such myths . We must guard our credibility as researchers , as ( the mouthpiece of ) scienti ﬁ c communities and work to the bene ﬁ t of those that we serve , namely the scienti ﬁ c community and the population at large , speci ﬁ cally educators and learners .
