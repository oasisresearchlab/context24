This makes 2 it challenging to understand the evolutionary basis for specific morphologies since the various 3 facets of cellular physiology may exert competing selective pressures on this trait . The influ - 4 ence of these pressures , moreover , will depend on the mechanisms of cellular morphogenesis . 5 To address this problem , we combined experimental cell biology with mechanics - based theory 6 to analyze the morphological diversity of tip - growing cells from across the tree of life . We 7 discovered that an instability in the convergent mechanism of “inflationary” growth shared by 8 these cells leads directly to a bifurcation in their fitness landscape , which imposes a strong 9 global constraint on their morphologies . Additionally , we found that co - selection for cell size 10 and elongation rate explains variation among observable morphologies . This analysis ratio - 11 nalizes the morphology - and provides quantitative insight into the ecology - of an enormous 12 diversity of important fungal , plant , protistan , and bacterial systems . Additionally , our study 13 elucidates a fundamental principle of evolutionary - developmental biology that would be diffi - 14 cult to rigorously demonstrate in more complex systems . 15 2 Introduction 16 It is often taken for granted that cellular morphology is functional [ 1 ] , and yet in relatively few 17 cases has the function or selective advantage of this trait been explicitly demonstrated [ 2 , 3 ] . 18 The comma shape of Vibrio cholerae cells , for one example , aids the “corkscrewing” of this 19 bacterial pathogen into the host epithelium . In other systems , like fish keratocytes , morphology 20 may be viewed as a consequence rather than a cause of cellular function . The highly variable 21 crescent morphology of these cells emerges from the cytoskeleton dynamics that also drive 22 cellular motility , yet motility is not dependent on a specific morphology [ 4 ] . Indeed , there 23 are many examples of strong correlations between cellular morphology and cell state , type , 24 or function [ 5 , 6 , 7 ] , but these correlations do not necessarily mean that morphology serves a 25 specific function . 26 On the contrary , cellular morphology affects many critical functions that cells perform . 27 During fungal , plant , and animal development , for example , cellular morphology influences 28 the assembly of the cytoskeleton [ 8 , 9 , 10 ] , which governs myriad sub - cellular processes as 29 well as the tissue morphogenesis that , in turn , feeds back onto cellular morphogenesis [ 11 , 12 ] . 30 Similarly , neuronal morphology affects action - potential propagation [ 13 ] , neuronal connectiv - 31 ity [ 14 ] , and signal integration [ 15 ] . Therefore , in general , cellular morphology is likely to be 32 subject to many competing evolutionary pressures , whose effect will also be constrained by 33 the mechanisms of cellular morphogenesis . Given this complexity , a major open challenge in 34 biology is to identify and weigh the multiple factors that determine cellular morphology for a 35 given system , that is , to understand cell morphology quantitatively as a complex trait . 36 Tip - growing cells ( Fig . 1B , C ) provide a simple example of the morphology - function ques - 37 tion . These cells are found in a polyphyletic group of species that encompasses nearly all fungi , 38 many important protistan pathogens , pollen tubes and root hairs in plants , as well as the phy - 39 lum of bacteria that produces our best antibiotics . On one hand , it is clear that the filamentous 40 morphology of tip - growing cells is intimately tied to their common function , which is to lo - 41 cate and consume nutrients ( or deliver the gamete in the case of pollen tubes ) . On the other 42 hand , the apical morphology of tip - growing cells is variable ( Fig . 1A , S1A ) and it is completely 43 unknown if specific morphologies contribute to cellular function ( s ) or whether this variation 44 3 simply reflects that in the underlying mechanisms of morphogenesis . This question is poignant 45 since tip growth has arisen many times via convergent evolution . 46 Evolutionary - developmental biology was conceived to address similar questions in animal 47 systems , but the classic concepts and tools from this field have rarely been applied to single - cell 48 morphology . A central tenet of evolutionary - developmental biology is that to understand mor - 49 phological diversity across species , it is often sufficient to understand the mechanistic variation 50 in their developmental programs . An important tool that emerged from this field was the “theo - 51 retical morphospace” [ 16 ] , which is typically used to interpret global constraints on organismal 52 morphology [ 17 , 18 ] . In this light , using tip - growing cells as a model comparative system , 53 our goal was to dissect the complex basis for cellular morphology by combining a mechanis - 54 tic investigation of morphogenesis with a top - down analysis of morphological variation across 55 taxa . 56 As for all walled cells , the morphology of tip - growing cells is defined by the geometry of 57 the cell wall , which is a polysaccharide gel whose specific chemistry is variable across taxa 58 ( Fig . 1C ) . Because cell - wall geometry is determined by the apical cell - wall expansion that also 59 leads to cell growth , morphogenesis and growth are the same process for these cells . In most 60 cases , tip growth is self - similar such that apical morphology is approximately constant ( Fig . 61 1B , 2A ) . Therefore , the coordinated steady - state synthesis , metabolism , and physical deforma - 62 tion ( expansion ) of the apical cell wall are key processes underlying tip - growth morphogenesis . 63 Tip - growing cells restrict cell - wall synthesis to the cell apex via localized exocytosis of 64 cell - wall polysaccharides ( Fig . 1C ) [ 19 , 20 ] . The actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in 65 both exocytosis [ 21 ] and the spatial organization of the cell apex more broadly [ 22 , 23 ] . How 66 exocytosis is coordinated with cell - wall expansion is not fully understood . For several systems , 67 however , it is clear that tip growth relies on a spatial gradient of cell wall biochemistry whereby 68 the nascent , expanding cell wall is biochemically distinct from the mature , non - expanding wall 69 ( Fig . 1C ) [ 24 , 25 , 26 ] . For example , during pollen tube growth , enzymes that prevent cell - wall 70 cross - linking are included in the same exocytic vesicles that contain new cell - wall polysaccha - 71 rides [ 27 ] , ensuring that this material is mechanically soft [ 24 ] . Pollen tube growth , in turn , 72 depends on the irreversible mechanical expansion of the soft apical cell wall by the turgor 73 4 pressure within the cell [ 28 ] . Similarly , cell - wall expansion during the growth of fission yeast 74 and the mating projections of budding yeast ( examples of transient tip growth ) is also driven 75 by turgor pressure [ 29 , 26 ] . In other words , tip growth is equivalent to controlled mechanical 76 “inflation” of the cell for each of these systems . 77 Pioneering theoretical studies demonstrated that inflationary tip growth can , in principle , 78 explain gross morphological variation of tip - growing cells from across nature [ 30 , 31 , 32 ] . 79 Specifically , this mechanism can generate both round and tapered apical morphologies ( Fig . 80 1A ) . However , inflationary tip growth was not tested in non - plant species , which are precisely 81 those that exhibit tapered apical morphologies - it is possible that other mechanisms drive 82 tip growth in these systems . Furthermore , the putative spatial relationship between cell - wall 83 mechanical properties and cell - wall synthesis that generated morphological variability was not 84 tested against cell biological data and was highly constrained . Accordingly , apical morphology 85 relied on a single parameter ( the theoretical morphospace was one - dimensional ) and generation 86 of tapered apical morphologies required a large spatial gradient in cell - wall thickness , which 87 is not observed experimentally [ 33 ] . Therefore , it is unknown i ) if diverse tip - growing systems 88 use inflationary growth , ii ) whether inflationary growth can generate natural morphologies in a 89 manner consistent with underlying cell biology , and iii ) whether tip - growing cells from across 90 nature assume all morphologies realizable by inflationary growth . 91 By addressing these specific questions we identified strong mechanistic and evolutionary 92 constraints on the morphological diversity of tip - growing cells from across nature . Through 93 precise spatial measurements of the expansion rates and mechanical tensions in the cell walls 94 of three divergent tip - growing systems - a protist , a fungus , and a plant - we first confirmed 95 that each of them drives tip growth via inflation . We then systematically generalized previ - 96 ous theoretical models of inflationary growth [ 30 , 31 ] to account for our data . This analysis 97 revealed a generic mechanical requirement for the morphogenesis of prolate and tapered cells 98 ( Fig . 1A ) , and allowed us to describe the entire morphospace for tip - growing cells on mecha - 99 nistic grounds . Surprisingly , we found that tip - growing morphologies from across nature popu - 100 lated a relatively small region of this morphospace . Further analysis revealed that an emergent 101 cusp bifurcation [ 34 ] in the morphospace separated fast - growing natural morphologies from 102 5 slow - growing hypothetical morphologies . We therefore interpret the morphospace as a fitness 103 landscape and conclude that natural selection for fast growth imposes a strong constraint on 104 the morphology of diverse tip - growing cells . Finally , we discovered that prolate and tapered 105 morphologies ( Fig . 1A ) balance the benefits of cell size and elongation rate , which rationalizes 106 the non - round morphology of most tip - growing systems . Collectively , these results explain the 107 morphological variation of an enormous diversity of important cellular systems and provide a 108 paradigmatic example of the interplay between cellular mechanics , cellular morphology , and 109 natural selection . 110 Results 111 Tip - growing cells span a low - dimensional morphological space 112 To understand the morphological variation of tip growth , it was first useful to objectively 113 quantify apical morphology across taxa . To do so , we recorded time - lapse phase - contrast mi - 114 crographs ( Fig . 1B , Movie S1 ) of hundreds of tip - growing cells from a broad diversity of or - 115 ganisms including fungi , protists , plants , and bacteria ( Fig . 1A , S1A ) . We then computationally 116 tracked cell - surface geometry from these micrographs ( Fig . 2A ) . Position on the cell surface 117 can be described by the co - ordinates s , the arclength from the cell pole , and θ , the azimuthal 118 angle ( Fig . 2B ) . We further quantified apical morphology by calculating the spatial profile of 119 the curvature of a cell “meridian , ” κ s ( s ) ( Fig . 2B - E ) . 120 For all tip - growing cells , the meridional curvature is maximal at or near the cell pole 121 ( s = 0 ) , and is zero at the cell equator , but the curvature profiles also revealed species - specific 122 morphological signatures . For example , hyphae of the oomycete Achlya bisexualis exhibited a 123 sharp curvature peak near the pole and a slight annular maximum distally , resulting in a tapered 124 apical morphology ( Fig . 2C ) . Hyphae of the chytrid fungus Allomyces arbuscula exhibited a 125 curvature peak near the pole and annular curvature shoulders , resulting in a prolate morphology 126 ( Fig . 2D ) . As was reported previously , the maximum meridional curvature of Lilium longiflo - 127 rum pollen tubes , Medicago truncatula root hairs , and Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells - each 128 of which has round morphology - occurred in an annulus ≈ 1 µ m from the pole ( Fig . 2E , S2B ; 129 6 [ 28 , 35 , 26 ] ) . 130 Despite these fine - scale features , when we applied principal components analysis to our 131 entire multi - species data set , the first two principal variables ( P1 and P2 ; Fig . 2F ) accounted 132 for 99 . 8 % of morphological variation ( Fig . S1C ) . Variation in the first principal variable cor - 133 responded precisely to scaling of apical morphology along the cell axis ( Fig . 2G , S1D ) . As a 134 result , P1 was also quantitatively correlated with the taper of the cell ( Fig . S1E ) . The second 135 principal variable was inversely related to the taper of the cell independent of axial scaling 136 ( Fig . 2H ) . Since taper is the most salient qualitative variable of tip - growing morphology ( Fig . 137 1A ) , our objective quantification of morphological variation was consistent with our intuitive 138 understanding of it and demonstrated that P1 and P2 are useful proxies for apical morphology . 139 Moreover , variation of P1 and P2 alone explained both the annular maximum of pollen tubes 140 and root hairs as well as the annular shoulders of fungal hyphae ( Fig . S1F ) , revealing that these 141 species - specific features are manifestations of low - dimensional geometrical variation . 142 Turgor pressure drives tip growth in diverse organisms 143 Apical morphology is determined by the spatial dependence of cell - wall expansion across 144 the cell apex ( Fig . 3A ) . Therefore , we next quantitatively measured this dependence using A . 145 bisexualis , A . arbuscula , and L . longiflorum as model systems since they largely encompass 146 tip - growing morphological and phylogenetic diversity ( Fig . 1A ) . To do so , we coated the cell 147 wall with electrically charged fluorescent microspheres and recorded time - lapse phase - contrast 148 and epifluorescence micrographs during tip growth ( Fig . 3B , C , Movie S1 , S2 ) . The cell wall 149 expands along both principal directions , s and θ ( Fig . 3A ) . By computationally tracking the 150 movement of the microspheres ( Fig . 3D , S2A ) and quantifying the rate at which they move 151 away from each other on the cell surface ( Fig . S2B - E ) , we calculated the principal expansion - 152 rate profiles , ˙ ε s ( s ) and ˙ ε θ ( s ) ( Fig . 3E - G ; Methods , Eq . 5 , 6 ) . 153 Although the expansion - rate profiles must vary in order to generate distinct apical mor - 154 phologies , the profiles from our three model systems all exhibited “azimuthal anisotropy” 155 ( ˙ ε θ > ˙ ε s ) except for at the pole ( where they must be equal due to rotational symmetry ) and 156 the equator ( where they are both zero ) . Previous low - resolution measurements of cell - wall ex - 157 7 pansion in several other tip - growing organisms [ 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 26 ] were also consistent 158 with azimuthal expansion - rate anisotropy , indicating that this is a widespread feature of tip 159 growth . 160 To explore the consequences of azimuthal expansion - rate anisotropy on apical morphology , 161 we developed a computational platform to simulate tip growth for a specific pair of principal 162 expansion - rate profiles . We found that azimuthal expansion - rate anisotropy was necessary to 163 generate tapered cells , but was not an intrinsic requirement for tip growth ( Fig . S2F - L ) . It was 164 previously pointed out that azimuthal expansion - rate anisotropy implies that turgor pressure 165 drives cell - wall expansion since the principal tensions in the wall , which balance pressure , 166 also exhibit azimuthal anisotropy ( λ θ > λ s ) due to the generic filamentous morphology of 167 tip - growing cells [ 35 , 40 ] . To demonstrate this azimuthal tension anisotropy , we explicitly 168 calculated the spatial profiles of the principal tensions from cell wall geometry ( Fig . 3H - J ; 169 Methods , Eq . 9 , 10 ) . 170 Turgor - driven “inflationary” growth has been demonstrated in several plant species [ 35 , 171 41 ] , as well as fission yeast [ 42 ] , but not in other fungal or protistan systems . To explicitly 172 test this mechanism , is not useful to directly compare the principal tension and expansion - 173 rate profiles since the latter are also dependent on the mechanical properties of the cell wall , 174 which are unknown and spatially inhomogeneous ( Fig . 3A ) . To circumvent this issue , we 175 hypothesized that the relative difference between the principal expansion rates will depend only 176 on the relative difference between the principal tensions , regardless of the local mechanical 177 properties . Therefore , we defined the expansion - rate and tension anisotropies quantitatively as : 178 α ˙ ε = ( ˙ ε θ − ˙ ε s ) / ˙ ε θ and α λ = ( λ θ − λ s ) / λ θ . We found a precise monotonic scaling between 179 these variables ( Fig . 3K - M ) . Since there is no explanation for this dependence other than that 180 wall expansion is caused by tension , this is strong evidence that inflation underlies tip growth 181 across taxa . 182 The spatial profile of cell - wall mechanical properties decays over two length - 183 scales 184 Inflationary tip growth means that the spatial expansion - rate profiles ( Fig . 3E - G ) , which 185 8 lead to specific cell shapes ( Fig . 2C - E ) , result from the spatial profiles of mechanical properties 186 of the cell wall . While it is not possible to measure these properties directly , we inferred 187 them by applying continuum - mechanics - based theory to our experimental data . A generic 188 mechanical relationship between principal expansion rates and tensions is one in which they 189 are related linearly [ 35 ] : 190 ˙ ε s = γ ( s ) ( λ s − νλ θ ) ˙ ε θ = γ ( s ) ( λ θ − νλ s ) ( 1 ) where γ and ν are mechanical properties . First , the “surface extensibility , ” γ , determines the 191 cell - wall expansion rate in a given direction if uniaxial tension is applied in that direction ; this 192 quantity accounts for both intrinsic mechanical properties ( resulting from , for example , degree 193 of cross - linking ) and those in cell - wall thickness . Second , the “flow coupling , ” ν , determines 194 the rate at which the wall contracts in one direction due to uniaxial tension in the orthogonal 195 direction . While the cell wall could possess non - linear mechanical properties for large or rapid 196 deformations , this linear implementation of inflationary tip growth will be approximately valid 197 at slow expansion rates characteristic of cell growth . It is unlikely , moreover , that higher - order 198 corrections will meaningfully expand the morphospace since γ ( s ) is a powerful spatially de - 199 pendent function . Finally , we found that our expansion - rate measurements are inconsistent 200 with structural anisotropy in the cell wall ( Fig . S2M ) , which could result from oriented synthe - 201 sis of cell wall polysaccharides ( Methods , Fig . S3 ) , and that in any case such anisotropy would 202 have a negligible affect on the morphospace that inflationary growth yields ( Fig . S4 ) . Indeed , 203 our linear isotropic implementation of inflationary tip growth ( Eq . 1 ) provided accurate , simul - 204 taneous fits of the experimental curvature ( Fig . S5 ) and expansion - rate profiles ( Fig . S2C - E ; 205 Methods ) from each cell of each of our model species . Therefore , this theoretical formulation 206 of tip growth is a useful tool for exploring its morphospace . 207 To this end , we calculated the experimental surface extensibility profiles , γ ( s ) , for each 208 model species by substituting their experimental principal expansion - rate and tension profiles 209 into Eq . 1 ( Fig . 4A - C ) . We found that these profiles possessed species - specific features that 210 qualitatively resembled the curvature profiles . In particular , the profiles from A . bisexualis and 211 9 A . arbuscula displayed sharp central peaks while the L . longiflorum meridional profile had a 212 slight annular maximum . Both the A . bisexualis and A . arbuscula azimuthal profiles had clear 213 “shoulders” that indicated that these profiles decayed to zero over two distinct length scales . 214 We adapted our computational platform to simulate tip growth for a given extensibility profile . 215 Inputing our experimental profiles generated apical morphologies that were indistinguishable 216 from the experimental morphologies ( Fig . 4D , E , S5 ) , further validating the use of the linear 217 implementation of inflationary tip growth ( Eq . 1 ) . 218 We hypothesized that we could accurately fit the surface extensibility profiles with a generic 219 spatial function that was peaked at the cell pole and decayed over two length scales . We first 220 tested a “Gaussian mixture” function ( the superposition of two Gaussians ; Fig . 4F ) . When 221 the widths ( l 1 , l 2 ) and amplitudes ( A 1 , A 2 ) of the component Gaussians were used as fitting 222 parameters , this function provided an accurate fit of the experimental profiles ( Fig . 4A - C ) . 223 To assess whether these empirical fits could generate realistic apical morphologies , we input 224 them into our simulation platform . In each case , the simulations reproduced accurate apical 225 morphologies : for A . bisexualis , the apical geometry of the simulation deviated slightly from 226 the experimental geometry but accurately reproduced the tapered morphology ( Fig . 4G , S5A ) , 227 while for A . arbuscula and L . longiflorum the difference between the simulated and experimen - 228 tal morphologies were only distinguishable by minute differences in their meridional curvature 229 profiles ( Fig . S5B , C ) . Although a single Gaussian function provided an accurate fit of the L . 230 longiflorum apical morphology ( Fig . S5C ) , it provided a poor prediction of A . bisexualis and A . 231 arbuscula morphology , demonstrating the requirement of a two - length - scale surface extensibil - 232 ity profile to generate tapered and prolate apical morphologies . We confirmed that these results 233 did not depend on the specific functional form of the surface extensibility profile by simulating 234 tip growth with non - Gaussian versions ( Fig . S5 ) . 235 In light of our analysis , we can summarize a mechanism of morphogenesis of prolate and 236 tapered ( i . e . , non - round ) apical morphologies . When subject to inflation by turgor pressure , 237 a two - length scale surface extensibility profile , in combination with the intrinsic azimuthal 238 anisotropy of the principal tension profiles , generates principal expansion rate profiles that 239 correspond to roughly isotropic expansion near the pole and gradual azimuthal expansion in the 240 10 sub - polar region ( Fig . 3E , F ) . Such a two - length - scale surface extensibility profile is necessary 241 and sufficient to generate even mildly tapered apical morphologies , which are characteristic of 242 nearly all tip - growing cells . 243 Exocytic vesicle density predicts cell wall mechanical properties 244 We next sought to identify the ultrastructural and / or biochemical factors that underlie the two 245 length scales associated with the surface extensibility in protists and fungi . First , we used 246 transmission electron microscopy to image thin cross - sections of fixed A . bisexualis hyphae , 247 which have a highly tapered morphology . In contrast to the predictions of previous theoretical 248 studies , we did not observe a strong gradient in cell - wall thickness ( Fig . 4H ) . However , there 249 was a clear spatial dependence of exocytic vesicle distribution within the cytoplasm : near the 250 pole there was a large pool of vesicles whereas in the subpolar region there was a thin layer 251 of cortical vesicles ( Fig . 4H - J ) . The quantitative spatial dependence of vesicle density showed 252 two clear length scales , whose values were consistent with the length scales associated with the 253 surface extensibility profile ( Fig . 4K , S6A ) . This supports a model in which exocytosis directly 254 softens the cell wall . 255 Next , we tested the hypothesis that the two length scales in surface extensibility correspond 256 to two biochemically distinct sections of the cell wall . To do so , we labeled the cell walls of 257 A . bisexualis hyphae with the dye Direct Red 23 , which preferentially binds to cellulose , and 258 Calcofluor White , which non - specifically binds to various β - glucans [ 43 ] . We found that Direct 259 Red 23 labeling was nearly uniform across the cell apex ( Fig . S6B , C ) , indicating that variation 260 in cellulose content does not mediate that in wall extensibility . Conversely , Calcofluor White 261 labeling was absent in the apical section of the cell wall , but increased sharply in the sub - 262 apical section ( Fig . S6D - F ) . This suggests that synthesis of Calcofluor - binding β - glucan ( s ) 263 may contribute to the determination of the longer of the two length scales associated with the 264 surface extensibility profile . 265 11 Diverse tip - growing cells exhibit a limited range of possible apical mor - 266 phologies 267 The identification of two clear length scales in the surface extensibility profiles of our non - 268 round model systems motivated us to test whether such a profile could accurately explain the 269 natural apical morphologies across our comprehensive multi - species data set ( Fig . 2F ) , and also 270 to explore the entire theoretical morphospace that a two - length - scale profile could generate . 271 Given such a surface extensibility profile , there are only three scalar parameters that determine 272 apical morphology : ν , l rat = l 2 / l 1 , A rat = A 2 / A 1 , where l i and A i are the length scales and 273 amplitudes of the component surface extensibility profiles ( Fig . 4F ; Methods ) . We simulated 274 tip growth across these parameters and created a theoretical morphospace by calculating the 275 dependence of the principal variables ( from our multi - species PCA analysis ) across this space 276 ( Fig . 5A - C ) . For a given flow coupling , most of the morphospace spanned by l rat and A rat had 277 low values of P1 , generating round apical morphologies ( Fig . 5A , D ) . However , there was a 278 narrow region of the morphospace that displayed high values of P1 , corresponding to tapered 279 morphologies . Importantly , although P1 is a useful proxy for cell shape , it did not completely 280 determine apical morphology . In particular , the region of high P1 ( tapered cells ) separated 281 regions of low P1 ( rounder cells ) that had different values of P2 ( Fig . 5C ) . We found this 282 morphospace provided an excellent fit of nearly every cell from every species ( Fig . S7A , B ) . 283 Variations in the flow coupling , ν , shifted the region of tapered morphologies , but not the 284 qualitative dependence of P1 on l rat and A rat ( Fig . S7D ) . Away from the tapered region , for 285 a given parameter coordinate , flow coupling had little effect on cell morphology ( Fig . S7E ) . 286 Furthermore , altering ν had no effect on the fitting power of the model across species ( Fig . 287 S7B ) . Thus , while for most systems we do not have information about the value of the flow 288 coupling , we conclude that this parameter is not important for shape determination , but rather 289 that l rat and A rat are the key morphogenetic parameters . 290 Interestingly , we found that the values of l rat and A rat that provided the best fits for the 291 cells in our data set populated a limited region of the morphospace , corresponding to a low 292 value of one or both of these parameters ( Fig . 5E , F ) . Furthermore , these ( l rat , A rat ) coordinates 293 were sharply bounded by the region of tapered morphologies . In order to gain insight into 294 12 this empirical constraint , we analyzed other metrics of cell geometry as a function of l rat and 295 A rat . We discovered that for a given value of l 1 ( the primary length scale in the the surface 296 extensibility profile ; Fig . 4F ) , that cell radius varied as a function of l rat and A rat , with lower 297 values of these variables yielding thinner cells ( Fig . 6A ) . Given that low values of l rat and A rat 298 also provided the best fits to experimental apical morphologies ( Fig . 5E , F ) , this means that 299 cells from across nature are relatively thin compared to the primary length scale of their surface 300 extensibility profile . While the transition between thin cells to wide ones was gradual as l rat 301 was increased , it was extremely sharp as A rat was increased for l rat ≳ 5 ( Fig . 6A ) . 302 A cusp bifurcation in the inflationary mechanism of tip growth constrains 303 apical morphology 304 Sharp changes in the solutions of dynamical systems upon small changes in their parameters 305 often reflect bistability . To explore this possibility , we performed a more fine - scale computa - 306 tional analysis of the region of the morphospace where cell radius changed sharply ( Fig . 6A , 307 red dotted box ) . As suspected , the sharp change in cell radius corresponded to the bistable 308 region of a cusp bifurcation or “catastrophe” [ 34 ] ( Fig . 6B ) . That is , above a critical value 309 of l ∗ rat ≈ 5 . 5 , the manifold of model solutions folds such that for a narrow range of A rat there 310 exist two stable apical morphologies for a single surface extensibility profile . One of these 311 morphologies is tapered , whereas the other is round but with a nub at the cell pole ( Fig . 6C ) . 312 Within this region , the apical morphology on which simulations converged depended on the 313 initial condition ( Fig . 6C , S7F ) . Accordingly , for values of l rat > l ∗ rat , the system exhibited hys - 314 teresis when A rat was cycled ( Fig . S7F ) . Whereas many tip - growing species were confined to 315 the low - radius region of the morphospace by virtue of having low values of l rat , species with ta - 316 pered apical morphologies ( e . g . , A . bisexualis and P . blaakeseanus sporangiophores ) clustered 317 below the bistable region , corresponding to low values of A rat ( Fig . 6A , S7G ) . 318 The bistable region in the morphospace results in what is colloquially known as a “tipping 319 point” [ 44 ] with respect to changes in A rat . Intuitively , this tipping point arises due to com - 320 petition between the two component surface extensibility profiles that comprise the net profile 321 ( Fig . 4F ) . The thinner of the two profiles , on its own , would generate a round cell with low 322 13 radius , while the wider profile would generate a round cell with a large radius . In the limit that 323 the amplitude of one of these profiles is much greater than the other , the profile with greater 324 amplitude generates a round cell that grows much faster than the profile with lower amplitude , 325 resulting in a round cell of either low or high radius . On the other hand , for a range of A rat , the 326 two profiles generate cells that grow at similar rates , and therefore competition between these 327 component profiles can generate tapered apical morphologies . However , tapered morphologies 328 are nearly unstable because turgor pressure is directionless and will tend to “inflate” the conical 329 sub - polar region of the cell . Finally , if the component profiles have similar widths ( i . e . , if l rat 330 is low ) they will generate rounded cells of similar radii . In this case , it does not matter which 331 solution grows faster , and the instability disappears at the critical point , or “cusp” ( Fig . 6B ) . 332 Our analysis made the strong prediction that altering the surface extensibility profile of 333 tip - growing cells would lead to previously unobserved apical morphologies . Specifically , be - 334 cause tapered morphologies are predicted to be nearly unstable , we hypothesized that mild non - 335 specific perturbations could induce them to adopt a round shape with a polar nub ( Fig . 6C ) . 336 To test this , we treated A . bisexualis hyphae with sub - inhibitory concentrations of latrunculin 337 B , which inhibits actin polymerization and therefore interferes with the spatial organization 338 of tip growth . Remarkably , this treatment resulted in stably growing hyphae with apical mor - 339 phologies qualitatively similar to those predicted by our theory ( Fig . 6D , Movie S3 ) . These 340 non - natural morphologies populated a region of the morphospace with slightly higher values 341 of A rat than that populated by untreated cells , and hyphae with l rat values greater than l ∗ rat now 342 clustered above the bistable region ( Fig . 6E ) . Therefore , although latrunculin - B - treated cells 343 cluster with untreated cells in the space spanned by l rat and A rat as would be expected from a 344 mild perturbation , the apical morphologies of the two populations diverge because they reside 345 on different branches of the manifold of stable apical morphologies . This is clearly illustrated 346 by comparing the values of P1 as a function of l rat for the two populations ( Fig . 6F ) . Finally , 347 latrunculin - B - treated cells were wider than untreated cells , in quantitative agreement with our 348 theory ( Fig . S7H ) . 349 To sum , small perturbations in key morphogenetic variables via sub - inhibitory pharmaco - 350 logical perturbation caused dramatic changes in cellular morphology , a hallmark of bistability . 351 14 The sharp morphological transition was precisely predicted by the inflationary model of growth 352 with a two - length scale surface extensibility profile , and there is no reason to expect this tran - 353 sition otherwise . These results are further validation of the ( linear isotropic ) inflationary mech - 354 anism of tip growth and are strong evidence that the emergent cusp bifurcation associated with 355 this mechanism imposes a strict , ubiquitous constraint on apical morphology . 356 The morphospace of tip growth corresponds to a fitness landscape 357 Although the cusp bifurcation emerges mechanistically from inflationary growth , the discovery 358 that it imposes a constraint on cellular morphology was empirical . To understand the basis for 359 this constraint we next asked how other aspects of cellular physiology depended on morphol - 360 ogy . Strikingly , we found that the rate of cellular elongation ( normalized to the rate of total 361 cell volume enlargement , v / ρ ) varied strongly across the morphospace ( Fig . 7A ) . Specifically , 362 elongation rate was inversely related to cell radius . This result has a simple intuitive explana - 363 tion : that for a given rate of cell - wall synthesis , a cell can either be thin and elongate rapidly 364 or be wide and elongate slowly . This analysis made the clear prediction that if we induce ta - 365 pered hyphae to adopt round , nubbed morphologies , that these wide cells would elongate more 366 slowly . Indeed , mild treatments of latrunculin B that caused cells to adopt non - natural wide 367 shapes also caused them to grow slower , in quantitative agreement with our theory ( Fig . 7B ) . 368 The observation that naturally occurring apical morphologies correspond to thin , fast - growing 369 cells - and that hypothetical wide , slow - growing morphologies are mechanistically possible but 370 not observed in nature - strongly suggests that the dependence of elongation rate on the mor - 371 phogenetic parameters represents a fitness landscape , and that variation in apical morphology 372 of tip - growing systems across the tree of life primarily reflects selection for fast elongation . 373 Tapered morphologies balance the benefits of elongation rate and cell ra - 374 dius 375 Within the limited region of the morphospace that yields fast tip growth , it is still possible that 376 the variation in apical morphology reflects selection for specific functions unrelated to growth 377 15 rate . For example , it has been proposed that tapered morphologies promote invasive growth 378 during pathogenesis [ 45 ] , but this intuition has not been tested . We explored an alternate possi - 379 bility : that tapered morphologies optimize a developmental variable , rather than an ecological 380 one . In this light , one simple benefit of being tapered may be that it allows hyphae to increase 381 their width beyond that prescribed by the primary length scale of cell - wall expansion . Although 382 we discovered that cell widening leads intrinsically to reduced elongation rate ( Fig . 6A , 7A ) , 383 we hypothesized that gradual sub - polar widening could be worth this reduction since fungi and 384 oomycetes transport cytoplasm over long distances via dissipative flow [ 46 ] , the energetic cost 385 of which will be inversely related to cell radius . To explore this hypothesis , we calculated the 386 cell radius per unit elongation rate , R / v , across our theoretical morphospace ; this quantity de - 387 scribes how wide a cell is for a given elongation rate . Remarkably , R / v was maximal near the 388 bistable region of the morphospace ( Fig . 7C ) , meaning that cells with tapered morphologies 389 not only grew relatively fast , but were also relatively wide for a rapidly elongating cell . That is , 390 growing as a tapered cell is a way of simultaneously balancing v / ρ and R / v , which are explicit 391 examples of complex traits . 392 Discussion 393 We demonstrated that the convergent mechanical mechanism of inflationary tip growth intrin - 394 sically possesses an instability that imposes a strong empirical constraint on the natural apical 395 morphologies of diverse tip - growing cells . Because cellular elongation rate is directly depen - 396 dent on the same parameters as morphology , and because natural morphologies elongate faster 397 than hypothetical morphologies , we conclude that the morphospace corresponds to a fitness 398 landscape , rationalizing the constraint . Finally , competition between elongation rate and radius 399 explains morphological variation within the natural fast - growing range of morphologies . 400 Thus , our analysis revealed three nested determinants of tip - growing morphology ( Fig . 7D ) . 401 First , inflationary growth imposes a mechanistic “developmental constraint” [ 47 ] on the apical 402 morphology of tip - growing cells in the sense that morphologies not represented by our theoret - 403 ical morphospace ( Fig . 6B ) could only be generated by adopting a completely different mech - 404 16 anism of cellular morphogenesis , for example , one where the cytoskeleton generates force . 405 However , the effective pressure that the cytoskeleton can exert is approximately one hundred 406 times smaller than than the typical turgor pressure of walled cells [ 48 ] . As a result , inflationary 407 growth naturally results from the presence of turgor pressure and the cell wall , which may be 408 viewed as the primary developmental constraints . 409 Due to the directionless nature of turgor pressure , any surface extensibility profile that de - 410 cays over a single length scale will generate a rounded cell apex ( Fig . S5C ) . The discovery 411 that natural tip - growing cells employ surface extensibility profiles that decay over one or two 412 length scales was empirical and inherently constrains apical morphologies . How would adding 413 a third length scale affect morphology ? Given our analysis , we propose that this would create 414 the possibility of cell apices with “graduated” taper ( i . e . where there are two sub - polar conical 415 sections with different slopes ; Fig . 7D ) . Although these morphologies are possible , we pro - 416 pose that they are still essentially just tapered cells , and therefore offer no advantage over those 417 generated with a two - length - scale surface extensibility profile . If so , one - and two - length scale 418 surface extensibility profiles generate the entire space of “useful” morphological variation . 419 Our most sweeping discovery was that an instability in inflationary tip growth imposes a 420 second , strong constraint on morphology . Although the cusp bifurcation arises mechanistically 421 from inflationary growth , the fact that it is a constraint was , prima facie , empirical . Tip - growing 422 cells are ubiquitous across nature , serve essential functions in agriculture , are the source of 423 many antibiotics , and are important pathogens of humans , crops , and fish . The finding of a 424 widespread constraint on their morphology may have implications in any of these domains . 425 Given the constraint imposed by the cusp bifurcation , highly tapered apical morphologies 426 are nearly unstable and therefore are vulnerable to perturbations ( Fig . 6 ) . This may explain 427 why relatively few tip - growing species display tapered morphology and implicitly suggests 428 that taper may serve an important function . One proposed function in oomycetes is that the 429 tapered hypha acts as a “knife” during invasive pathogenesis [ 49 ] . This analogy breaks down 430 when comparing the mechanics of a knife and a cell : while mechanical stress applied by a knife 431 increases with increasing sharpness ( i . e . taper ) , the mechanical stress applied by the apex of a 432 tip - growing cell is simply equal to the turgor pressure , regardless of the taper . 433 17 We discovered an alternative function of taper , which imposed a third constraint : that it 434 yields the widest possible rapidly elongating cells ( Fig . 7C ) . The mycelia of many fungi and 435 oomycetes grow as connected networks of hyphae in which cytoplasm moves via gross mass 436 transport over macroscopic distances , a process that is energetically expensive for thin hyphae 437 [ 46 ] . Interestingly , oomycetes exhibit a large variation in hyphal radii , and therefore taper [ 32 ] . 438 Based on our analysis , we predict that highly tapered cells act as arterial hyphae that supply less 439 tapered hyphal branches with cytoplasm . This will be an interesting subject for future research . 440 The global constraint on apical cell morphology imposed by the cusp bifurcation only 441 makes sense if we interpret the dependence of elongation rate on the morphospace as a fit - 442 ness landscape ( Fig . 7A ) . In other words , the assertion that fast tip growth is selected for by 443 nature is a major inferential result of our analysis . On one hand , this is a simple conclusion 444 that makes sense in terms of the ecology of these cells . For example , fungal , oomycete , and 445 bacterial hyphae are the vegetative cells that compete within and between species to locate and 446 consume nutrients . On the other hand , this a profound result that provides a window into the 447 ecology - and rationalizes the morphology - of an enormous diversity of interesting and im - 448 portant species . It is well understood that instabilities can dramatically affect the dynamics of 449 ecological systems [ 50 , 51 ] . Similar dynamics in evolutionary systems have been predicted 450 to exist theoretically [ 52 ] . Here , we explicitly demonstrate that an intrinsic instability in a fit - 451 ness landscape can dictate evolutionary outcomes , thereby experimentally demonstrating a new 452 conceptual paradigm for evolutionary - developmental biology . 453 In the language of life - history theory , selection for fast growth at the expense of morpholog - 454 ical variation implies that tip - growing cells have undergone “ r - selection , ” meaning that in order 455 to capitalize on resource abundance morphology is primarily selected insofar as it is correlated 456 with rapid growth [ 53 ] . Therefore , just as the “function” of the shape of a dolphin is largely 457 to minimize hydrodynamic drag ( an external force ) , the main function of the morphology of 458 tip - growing cells is to maximize the effect of turgor pressure ( an internal force ) . More broadly , 459 the real question is not whether cell morphology or growth rate are selected for - these are both 460 crucial , complex phenotypes that will be pulled by natural selection in various ways for vari - 461 ous reasons . Rather , we set out to explicitly quantify how such complex phenotypes interact 462 18 in the context of evolution . In the case of tip - growing cells , growth rate won the evolutionary 463 tug - of - war , which still however left room for functional morphological variation , particularly 464 with respect to selection for cell width . 465 Our analysis therefore provides a paradigmatic case study in how the interaction of physical 466 principles with natural selection can sculpt biological form . Since turgor pressure is direction - 467 less , inflationary growth tends to generate rounded apexes for the same reason that balloons 468 are roughly round . While establishing a cell - wall surface extensibility profile with two length 469 scales allows for tapered apical morphologies , these morphologies are nearly unstable since it 470 is difficult to create the straight meridians on the conical region of these cells in the presence 471 of pressure . Natural selection acts on this widespread developmental constraint . Therefore , 472 tip growth morphogenesis specifically depends on the direct interplay between a fundamental 473 physical principle ( minimization of surface energy ) and a fundamental evolutionary principle 474 ( fast reproduction outcompetes slow reproduction ) . Morphology itself may be useful only in - 475 sofar as it obeys these nested constraints . As D’Arcy Thompson predicted , “the manifestations 476 of adaptation become part of a mechanical philosophy” in which “ la Nature agit toujours par 477 les moyens les plus simples , ” but also “ chaque chose finit toujours par s’accommoder a son 478 milieu ” [ 54 ] . 479 Acknowledgments 480 We thank Jacques Dumais for helpful discussions .

All fungal and oomycete cultures were 491 cultured on yeast - malt growth medium ( 0 . 3 % yeast extract ( m / v ) , 0 . 3 % malt extract , 0 . 5 % 492 peptone , 1 % dextrose , and 1 % agarose ) . Phycomyces sporangiophores were grown on potato 493 dextrose agar . Pollen tubes were grown in 15 mM MES , 1 . 6 mM H 3 BO 3 , 0 . 1 mM KCl , 7 . 5 % 494 sucrose ( m / v ) , adjusted to pH 5 . 3 with 0 . 1 mM KOH [ 55 ] . S . venezuelae was cultured in ISP 495 media . C . glutamicum was cultured in BHI media . 496 Imaging and image analysis 497 For imaging of L . longiflorum and C . japonica pollen tubes , 1 hour prior to imaging freeze - 498 dried pollen grains grains were germinated in a growth medium . A thin layer ( < 1 mm ) of solid 499 growth medium ( 1 % low melting point agarose ) was deposited onto the bottom of a custom - 500 made chamber , consisting of a dental polymer gasket adhered to a cover glass . While the 501 agarose was still in a molten state , pollen grains were partially embedded in the solid medium 502 by rinsing it with the liquid suspension of grains . The slide chambers were then filled with 503 liquid medium . Cells that emerged from grains affixed to the agarose in this way were likely to 504 grow along the gel - liquid interface . 505 For imaging fungal and oomycete hyphae ( except for A . arbuscula ) dental - polymer slide 506 chambers were prepared , as above , with 1 % low melting point agarose yeast - malt growth 507 medium . After the agarose solidified , the chamber was inoculated with a small block of agarose 508 from the growing front of the mycelium in the propagation culture . The top of the slide cham - 509 ber was then sealed with a cover slip . After incubation for 48 - 72 hours at room temperature , 510 the top of the chamber was opened , and filed with liquid medium for imaging . 511 For imaging A . arbuscula , cultures were propagated in cover - glass bottomed Petri dishes 512 ( MakTek ) . The bottom of the dishes were covered in a layer of ≈ 2 mm of solid growth medium 513 ( 1 % agarose ) and one edge of this substrate was inoculated . The hyphae grew in the thin layer 514 of liquid between the cover glass and the agarose at the bottom of the dish . Cells were imaged 515 20 5 - 6 days after inoculation . 516 For imaging of S . venezuelae , 5 µ L of exponential phase culture was spotted onto a 1 % 517 agarose pad that was molded in a FastWell reagent barrier ( Grace Biolabs ) . 518 For imaging of C . glutamicum , exponential phase cells were loaded into a bacterial mi - 519 crofluidic plate ( CellASIC ) and perfused with BHI media during imaging using the ONIX 520 microfluidic system . 521 Time lapse images of pollen tubes , fungal and protistan hyphae , and bacterial cells were 522 taken using an Eclipse TI2 inverted microscope ( Nikon ) and a Prime BSI sCMOS digital cam - 523 era ( Photometrics ) . 524 For imaging of P . blakesleeanus , a glass vial filled with solid media was inoculated with a 525 heat - shocked spore suspension , and placed on custom stage equipped with 3 - D mechanical ad - 526 justment and illuminated with an LED light ( Tungsram ) from above in a temperature - controlled 527 room ( 22 ◦ C ) . Time - lapse images were taken using a digital CMOS camera ( MicroQ ) attached 528 to the ocular tube of a horizontal stereo microscope ( Leitz ) [ 56 ] . 529 All cell tracking was performed using custom MATLAB scripts . All software used in this 530 study is available upon request . 531 Cell wall geometry for S . pombe and M . truncatula root hairs were obtained from previously 532 published data sets [ 26 , 57 ] . 533 Single - cell geometry and principal components analysis 534 To extract single - cell apical cell - wall geometry , we calculated the meridional curvature profile 535 κ s = dφ ( s ) / ds of the cell outline ( i . e . , cross - sectional meridian ) extracted from each time point 536 of a time - lapse image sequence ( Fig . 2A , C - D ) . We then reconstructed the time - averaged apical 537 geometry for each cell by integrating the time - averaged meridional curvature profile : 538 21 φ ( s ) = (cid:90) s 0 κ ( s ) ds ( 2 ) x ( s ) = (cid:90) s 0 sin ( φ ) ds ( 3 ) y ( s ) = (cid:90) s 0 cos ( φ ) ds . ( 4 ) So as to only perform PCA on the apical region and not the distal region , we truncated the 539 outlines using φ = [ − 0 . 95 π / 2 , 0 . 95 π / 2 ] as bounds , and then interpolated the outlines with 75 540 equally spaced fiducial points . We found that φ = 0 . 95 π / 2 was the largest cutoff that did not 541 include large portions of the cylindrical region of the cell . The axis of the apex was found by 542 averaging opposing fiducial points on opposite sides of the cell meridian , and the outlines were 543 rotated and translated such that their axes were aligned and that the cell pole was located at 544 the origin . Principal components analysis was then applied to the interpolated ( x , y ) outlines at 545 these points using the MATLAB command pca . 546 Microsphere imaging and measurement of meridional speed 547 The meridional speed and expansion rate measurements for Lilium longiflorum pollen tubes 548 ( Fig . 2E , 3G , J , S2E ) was published previously [ 28 ] . For microsphere experiments related to A . 549 bisexualis and A . arbuscula , 0 . 1 µ m aminated fluorescent microspheres ( Sigma - Aldrich ) were 550 included in all media ( 10 − 4 dilution from stock ) , including solid media . For A . bisexualis , 551 just after the slide chamber was filled with microsphere - containing media prior to imaging , the 552 microspheres had a high affinity for the cell walls and bound to them . As the charges on the 553 microspheres were neutralized , they lost their affinity for the cell wall , making it necessary to 554 re - immerse them in freshly mixed microsphere growth medium every 10 - 15 minutes during 555 imaging . 556 For A . arbuscula , a section of the solid media several millimeters in front of the leading edge 557 of the mycelium was excised with a scalpel , forming a well to which microsphere - containing 558 liquid media was added . Over the course of minutes , the microspheres diffused through the 559 liquid layer between the cover glass as the solid media and reached the mycelium , whereupon 560 22 they adhered to the hyphal cell walls . 561 For L . longiflorum pollen tubes , to adhere the microspheres to cells , a syringe pump was 562 used to load a glass microcapillary ( inner diameter ≈ 50 µ m ) with microsphere - containing 563 media . The microcapillary was mounted on a micromanipulator and was used to address elon - 564 gating pollen tubes . Pressure was applied manually to the syringe pump to stream microspheres 565 past the growing pollen tubes during growth . After 5 - 10 seconds of streaming the suspension 566 past the tip , the exterior of the cell was effectively coated in microspheres . The microsphere 567 medium was continually streamed past the cells during imaging such that their cell walls were 568 constantly covered as they expanded . 569 Fluorescent microsphere tracking was performed using custom MATLAB scripts [ 28 ] . From 570 the tracks of the microspheres ( Fig . S2A ) and the cell surface geometry , we calculated the 571 meridional speed of the microspheres ( Fig . S2B - D ) , which is the speed at which the micro - 572 spheres move along the cell meridian in the frame of reference of the cell pole . To calcu - 573 late the principal expansion - rate profiles from the experimental measurements of meridional 574 speed , the spatial dependence of the meridional speed was fit with the empirical function 575 v ( φ ) = v 0 sin φ ( 1 + c 1 φ + c 2 φ 2 + · · · ) [ 35 ] . F - tests were used to determine the maximum 576 number of free parameters , c i , that could be retained in this function without fitting noise in 577 the data . The principal expansion rates were calculated from the time - averaged cell geometry 578 profile and this fit of the meridional speed profile using the equations : 579 ˙ ε s = κ s dv s dφ ( 5 ) ˙ ε θ = cos φ r v s ( 6 ) where r ( s ) is the local radius , or the radial distance of a point on the cell surface from the cell 580 axis ( Fig . 2A ) . 581 Because the meridional speed and the cell wall geometry specifically determine the prin - 582 cipal expansion rates , to fit these spatially dependent variables together is to also fit the prin - 583 cipal expansion rates . The free fit of the meridional speed corresponds to the fit of the fully 584 23 anisotropic mechanical model ( Eq . 16 , below ) shown in Fig . S2C - E . To fit the experimental 585 meridional speed and cell - wall geometry given isotropical mechanical properties ( Fig . 2C - 586 E ) , we followed a method that we previously developed [ 58 ] . Note that in previous analyses , 587 isotropical mechanical properties have been distinguished from transverse ( in - plane ) mechan - 588 ical properties where the cell walls is stratified in the normal dimension . However , since we 589 used a two - dimensional formulation of cell surface mechanics , there is no difference between 590 these cases . 591 The principal tensions were calculated from the experimental profiles of the meridional and 592 azimuthal curvatures , using Eqs . 7 - 10 below . An arbitrary pressure of 1 atm was assumed . 593 This choice does not affect the spatial distributions of the tensions . 594 Simulations of cell growth and parameter space search 595 Simulations of tip growth with arbitrary expansion rates or extensibility profile were performed 596 with a custom MATLAB routine . An initial hemispherical geometry was defined with N ( an 597 odd number typically between 101 and 301 ) discrete ( x , y ) co - ordinates . The arclength , s , 598 was calculated on the geometry , with the polar point defined as s = 0 ( Fig . 2A ) . The surface 599 extensibility ( or expansion - rate ) profile ( s ) to be simulated was then prescribed on these points . 600 The radius of the hemisphere was arbitrary but was generally chosen to be somewhat larger 601 than the largest length scale associated with the extensibility profile . 602 When the surface extensibility profile was prescribed , at each step of the simulation , first 603 the principal curvatures in the cell wall were calculated [ 30 ] : 604 κ s ( s ) = ∂φ ( s ) ∂s ( 7 ) κ θ ( s ) = sin ( φ ( s ) ) r ( s ) ( 8 ) where r ( s ) is the radial distance from the cell axis to the fiducial point . From the principal 605 24 curvatures , the principal tensionss were calculated using using force - balance equations [ 35 ] : 606 λ s ( s ) = P 2 κ θ ( 9 ) λ θ ( s ) = P 2 κ θ (cid:18) 2 − κ s κ θ (cid:19) ( 10 ) In general , the turgor pressure was arbitrarily defined since it only affects the global magnitude 607 of the expansion rates , and therefore the rate of tip growth , rather than the cellular morphology . 608 Unless principal expansion rate profiles were prescribed , they were calculated rom the principal 609 tensions using Eq . 1 of the main text : 610 ˙ ε s ( s ) = γ ( λ s − νλ θ ) ( 11 ) ˙ ε θ ( s ) = γ ( λ θ − νλ s ) ( 12 ) To then calculate the velocity of each fiducial point we inverted the kinematic equations [ 30 ] : 611 ˙ ε s = v n κ s + ∂v t ∂s ( 13 ) ˙ ε θ = v n κ θ + v t cos ( φ ) r ( 14 ) where v n and v t are the velocity components of the discrete points in the directions normal and 612 tangential to the cell outline . Finally , the displacement of each point v n dt , v t dt was calculated 613 ( where dt was the time between steps ) , converted to cartesian co - ordinates , and added to the 614 cell geometry to find the updated cell geometry . This updated geometry was smoothed with a 615 smoothing spline ( the MATLAB csaps command , with smoothing factor 0 . 9999 ) , which was 616 critical to prevent small errors from causing runaway instabilities . This routine was iterated 617 until cell geometry converged . At each step , the time step was updated to ensure that the 618 displacement at the pole converged to a fixed , small value . 619 To validate the simulation routine , we input the experimental surface extensibility profiles , 620 which were calculated to perfectly fit the experimental apical morphology [ 58 ] . In our simula - 621 tions , this surface extensibility profile yielded a meridional curvature profile that was indistin - 622 guishable from the experimental profile ( Fig . S5 ) . 623 25 For the parameter space searches described in Fig . 5 and Fig . S7 , l rat was varied on the do - 624 main ( 1 , 10 ) at 0 . 25 increments and A rat was varied on the domain ( 0 , 0 . 1 ) at 0 . 005 increments 625 and the domain ( 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 ) at 0 . 05 increments . For each value of A rat , the search was initiated at 626 l rat = 1 and A rat was increased incrementally to 0 . 5 , using the solution of cell shape from the 627 previous parameter co - ordinate as the initial condition for each simulation . 628 To resolve the fold bifurcation shown in Fig . 6B , we focused on the domain l rat ∈ ( 1 , 10 ) 629 ( increments of 0 . 25 ) and A rat ∈ ( 0 , 0 . 1 ) ( increments of 0 . 0025 ) . We searched the space as 630 before , but both increased and decreased A rat for a given l rat . To resolve the fold bifurcation 631 we found ( l rat , A rat ) co - ordinates where there were two stable solutions . For each one of these 632 co - ordinates , from the two stable apical geometries , ( x 1 i , y 1 i ) and ( x 2 i , y 2 i ) , we found ten inter - 633 mediate geometries ( x 1 i , y 1 i ) + n ( ( x 2 i , y 2 i ) − ( x 2 i , y 2 i ) ) / 9 , where n = 0 , 1 , . . . , 9 . We then initiated 634 a simulation with each of these geometries and determined to which stable solution the simula - 635 tion converged ( Fig . S7F ) . An unstable solution was computed to be the mean of neighboring 636 geometries that converged to different stable fixed geometries ( dotted line , Fig . S7F ) . From 637 these unstable geometries , the radius could be calculated to calculate the whole manifold of 638 solutions shown in Fig . 6B . 639 To calculate the best fit of the model for each experimental cell geometry , we first found 640 the time - averaged cell outline , which was found by integrating the time - averaged meridional 641 curvature profile using Equations 2 - 4 . We discretized the time - averaged experimental cell out - 642 line into the same number of points that was used to simulate tip growth in the computational 643 parameter space search . We then calculated the normalized average error , 644 E = (cid:80) Ni = 1 de i Nds ( 15 ) which is the average error of each discretized point relative to the interpoint arclength . We 645 found values of l rat and A rat that minimized this error . 646 The normalized elongation rate ( Fig . 7A ) was calculated as follows . At steady - state , the 647 total rate at which the cell increases in volume is ρ = πR 2 v , where R is the cell radius and 648 v is the elongation rate of the cell . Therefore , a normalized form of the elongation rate is 649 ˜ v = vρ = 1 πR 2 . This quantity has dimensions of inverse area : it is the rate at which the cell 650 26 elongates per unit volume added to the cell . We arbitrarily dimensionalized the morphospace 651 in Fig . 7A using the radius of a pollen tube . This specific dimensionalization does not affect 652 the landscape of v . 653 The dependence of the ratio of cell radius and elongation rate was calculated by first cal - 654 culating the absolute ( un - normalized ) radius and elongation rate of the simulations . We then 655 dimensionalized these variables by arbitrarily assuming that cells that are generated by a single - 656 length - scale surface extensibility profile grow with the radius and elongation rate of a pollen 657 tube . This specific dimensionalization does not affect the landscape of R / v . 658 Theoretical analysis of anisotropical version of the linear extensibility model 659 Equation 1 of the main text is a generic linear formulation of inflationary tip growth if the wall is 660 isotropic within the plane of the cell wall , meaning that cell wall polymers are not synthesized 661 in an oriented manner . In previous formulations of tip growth ( e . g . , [ 35 ] ) , “transverse” or 662 “plane” isotropy was distinguished from isotropy when considering stratification of cell wall 663 material in the normal direction . However , in our two - dimensional formulation isotropy and 664 transverse isotropy are the same thing , and we therefore use the word isotropy to mean isotropic 665 in the two - dimensional sense . 666 Although it is unlikely that a large degree of structural anisotropy ( resulting form oriented 667 synthesis ) can develop across the apical cell wall during tip growth since the polar cell wall 668 must be isotropic , it was important to demonstrate this or demonstrate that the possibility of 669 structural anisotropy in the cell wall does not alter our results . Here , we perform two analyses 670 that demonstrate both of these results . 671 i . First , the fully anisotropic version of Eq . 1 of the main text is the most general version of 672 the linear extensibility implementation of the inflationary mechanism of cell growth : 673   ˙ ε s ˙ ε θ   =   γ s − γ s θ − γ s θ γ θ   (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) Γ   λ s λ θ   ( 16 ) The diagonal elements of Γ ( γ s and γ θ ) are the anisotropic surface extensibilities and determine 674 27 how fast the wall expands in a given direction if uniaxial tension is applied in that direction . 675 These quantities are equal at the cell pole due to rotational symmetry but may be unequal in 676 the sub - polar cell wall if oriented cell wall polysaccharides were synthesized there . The off - 677 diagonal element γ s θ mechanically couples the principal directions by determining how fast the 678 wall contracts in one direction due to uniaxial tension in the orthogonal direction . This matrix 679 equation can be re - written : 680 ˙ ε s = γ s ( λ s − νγ rat λ θ ) ˙ ε θ = γ θ ( λ θ − νλ s ) ( 17 ) where here ν = γ sθ γθ and γ rat = γ θ γ s is the ratio between the principal surface extensibility profiles . 681 Solving for the surface extensibility profiles , we find : 682 γ θ = ˙ ε θ λ θ 1 1 − ν λsλθ γ s = ˙ ε s λ s + νγ θ λ θ λ s ( 18 ) where ν = γ sθ γθ is the only quantity that we can not experimentally measure . Substituting exper - 683 imental values for the principal expansion rate and tension profiles into Eq . 18 reveals that for 684 all reasonable values of 0 < ν ¡ 0 . 75 , the principal surface extensibility profiles are approxi - 685 mately equal across the apical cell wall ( Fig . S3 ) , indicating that the degree of anisotropy in the 686 cell wall is negligible . Further allowing for ν to be spatially inhomogeneous allows the profiles 687 to be precisely equal ( theory not shown ) . 688 ii . Second , note that it is clear that the azimuthal surface extensibility profiles for A . bisex - 689 ualis and A . arbuscula ( and probably their meridional profiles ) decay over two length scales , 690 regardless of anisotropy or the flow coupling , ν ( Fig . S3A , B ) . That is , two length scales in 691 the azimuthal extensibility profile is directly implied by the kinematics of tip growth of these 692 species , independent of whether any anisotropy is present . 693 This result allowed us to perform a parameter space search similar to the one we performed 694 for the isotropic case , but for the case where anisotropy develops due to the meridional surface 695 extensibility profile decaying with one length scale . The key morphological parameters in this 696 case are the ratio of the two length scales associated with the azimuthal surface extensibility 697 28 profile and the ratio of the amplitudes of the two component profiles . We explore the case 698 where the meridional surface extensibility profile decayed with a single length scale equal to the 699 smaller length scale of the azimuthal profile ( Fig . S4A ) , generating anisotropy . This parameter 700 space search gave rise to a morphospace that was very similar to the morphospace generated by 701 the isotropic version of the model ( Fig . S4B ) . Furthermore , this morphospace possessed a cusp 702 bifurcation that constrained natural apical morphologies in the exact same manner as that from 703 the isotropical model ( Fig . S4C , D ) . In other words , the cusp catastrophe is a generic feature 704 of inflationary tip growth that constrains the apical morphologies of tip growing cells and that 705 does not depend on the specific molecular architecture of the cell wall . Therefore , although 706 our data strongly suggest that the cell wall is not structurally anisotropic ( Fig . S3 ) , they also 707 implies that even if anisotropy were to develop , it does not alter any of our results . 708 Next , we explicitly demonstrated that structural anisotropy alone cannot explain non - rounded 709 apical morphologies if the azimuthal surface extensibility does not decay with two distinct 710 length scales . To do this , we simulated tip growth where the cell wall developed structural 711 anisotropy sub - polarly by imposing that the two principal surface extensibility profiles decayed 712 with distinct length scales , but where each one decayed over a single length scale . To simulate 713 azimuthal structural anisotropy ( γ θ > γ s ) , we imposed that the azimuthal surface extensibility 714 profile was a Gaussian that decayed over a single length scale , l θ = A θ e ( − s / l θ ) 2 ( Fig . S4E ) . To 715 obtain the meridional surface extensibility profile , we multiplied this first profile by a spatially 716 dependent extensibility ratio , γ rat = γ θ γ s = ( 1 − γ rat ) e ( − s / l rat ) 2 + γ rat that also decayed with a 717 single length scale , l rat and where γ rat is the maximum degree of anisotropy ( Fig . S4E ) . In this 718 case , the key morphological parameters are the ratio l rat / l θ and γ rat . A parameter space search 719 across all possible morphological parameters revealed that no combination of parameters could 720 produce highly tapered apical morphologies characteristic of A . bisexualis or accurately ex - 721 plain the curvature profile of A . arbuscula ( Fig . S4F ) . Indeed , nearly the entire parameter space 722 yielded rounded shapes with values of P1 ≲ 3 , whereas the majority of natural species have 723 higher values of P1 ( Fig . 2F ) . A parallel analysis in which meridional structural anisotropy 724 ( γ s < γ θ ) developed sub - polarly revealed similar results ( Fig . S4G , H ) . 725 Finally , the anisotropical version of inflationary growth ( Eq . 16 ) provides negligible ad - 726 29 ditional fitting power over the isotropical version ( Eq . 1 ; Fig . 2C - E , see above for fitting 727 strategy ) . 728 To summarize our analysis of tip growth with structural anisotropy , analysis of the expan - 729 sion rate profiles strongly suggest that the cell wall of A . bisexualis and A . arbuscula are not 730 anisotropic ( Fig . S3 ) . However , even if weak anisotropy were to develop sub - polarly , the az - 731 imuthal surface extensibility would have to decay with two length scales , which would lead 732 to a cusp bifurcation in the morphospace that constrains natural morphologies , quantitatively 733 similar to that observed for the isotropic case ( Fig . S4 ) . 734 Fluorescence cell wall labeling of A . bisexualis 735 To fluorescently label the cell walls of A . bisexualis hyphae , we cultured them on cover - glass - 736 bottomed slides , as above . Calcofluor white ( 10 µ M ; Sigma - Aldrich ) or Direct Red23 ( 0 . 1 737 mg / mL , Sigma - Aldrich ) were dissolved in YMM media . To control for binding kinetics of 738 the dye , we also included 1 M sorbitol in the media , which plasmolyzes the hyphae , leaving 739 just the cell wall . We added the dye / sorbitol media to growing hyphae and incubated fro 30 740 min , and then imaged . The fluorescence intensity along the cell wall was analyzed with custom 741 MATLAB algorithms . 742 Transmission electron microscopy of A . bisexualis 743 A . bisexualis hyphae were fixed with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 075M phosphate buffer ( pH 744 7 . 2 ) for 30 mins at room temperature , and then at overnight at 4 ◦ C . The samples were washed 745 3 times with 0 . 075M phosphate buffer ( 10 minutes each time ) , post - fixed with 1 % osmium 746 tetroxide for 1 . 5 hour at room temperature , and dehydrated in the serial of ethanol solutions ( 30 , 747 50 , 70 , 85 , 95 , 100 % ; 10 min each ) . The hyphae were then washed in acetone two times for 748 10 min each , infiltrated with acetone and embedded in Spurr ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . 749 Semi - thin sections ( 500 nm ) were stained with 1 % toluidine blue . Ultrathin sections ( 75 nm ) 750 were cut and mount on a formvar coated slot grid and stained with uranyl acetate and lead 751 citrate by standard methods . Stained grids were imaged with Gemini300 scanning electron 752 microscope ( Zeiss ) using the STEM detector at 20 kV with working distance of 3 . 3mm and 753 30 scan speed of 8 , the image pixel size is 5 . 6 nm . 754 The cell wall geometry and exocytic vesicles from TEM micrographs were extracted man - 755 ually . Vesicles were binned by distance from the cell pole along the cell axis , and then mapped 756 to the point on the cell outline at the same axial distance . The vesicles density at each point 757 along the cell outline was then calculated as the total number of vesicles at that point divided 758 by 2 πrdl , where dl is the length of a bin and r is the radius at that point . 759 Latrunculin B treatment of cells 760 Latrunculin B ( abcam ) was dissolved in DMSO to make a 2 . 5 mM master stock solution , which 761 was further diluted 1000 fold in water to make 2 . 5 µ M Latrunculin B stock solution . This was 762 used to prepare yeast malt media containing 1 % agarose and 80 nM latrunculin B . Molten 763 media was poured as a thin ( ≈ 3 mm ) layer into petri dishes and allowed to solidify . A circular 764 punch was used to cut out sections of this agarose . These sections were then placed on top of 765 A . bisexualis hyphae that were growing in cover glass imaging chambers described above . An 766 additional 100 µ L of 80nM Latrunculin B solution was added to the top of the agar pad . The 767 mycelia were left to grow overnight at room temperature before imaging . 768 To calculate the theoretical prediction of the effect of latrunculin B on cell elongation rate 769 shown in Fig . 7B , we used the expression ρ = πR 2 v , where ρ is the rate of volume increase . 770 For the untreated case we calculated ρ by substituting experimental values of R and v , and 771 found the predicted value of v for the latrunculin - treated cells by substituting in their mean 772 radius , R , and the calculated value of ρ . 773 References 774 [ 1 ] Kevin D Young .
