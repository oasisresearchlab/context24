Cantley , Harvard Institutes of Medicine , Boston , MA , and approved March 30 , 2004 ( received for review November 13 , 2003 ) The signaling pathways mediated by Rho family GTPases have been implicated in many aspects of cell biology . The speciﬁcity of the pathwaysisachievedinpartbytheselectiveinteractionbetween Dbl family guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) and their Rho GTPase substrates . Here , we report a ﬁrst - generation small - molecule inhibitor of Rac GTPase targeting Rac activation by GEF . The chemical compound NSC23766 was identiﬁed by a structure - based virtual screening of compounds that ﬁt into a surface groove of Rac1 known to be critical for GEF speciﬁcation . In vitro it could effectively inhibit Rac1 binding and activation by the Rac - speciﬁc GEF Trio or Tiam1 in a dose - dependent manner without interfering with the closely re - lated Cdc42 or RhoA binding or activation by their respective GEFs or with Rac1 interaction with BcrGAP or effector PAK1 . In cells , it potently blocked serum or platelet - derived growth factor - induced Rac1 activation and lamellipodia formation without affecting the activity of endogenous Cdc42 or RhoA . Moreover , this compound reduced Trio or Tiam1 but not Vav , Lbc , Intersectin , or a constitutively active Rac1 mutant - stimulated cell growth and suppressed Trio , Tiam1 , or Ras - induced cell transformation . When applied to human prostate cancer PC - 3 cells , it was able to inhibit the proliferation , anchorage - independent growth and invasion phenotypes that re - quire the endogenous Rac1 activity . Thus , NSC23766 constitutes a Rac - speciﬁc small - molecule inhibitor that could be useful to study the role of Rac in various cellular functions and to reverse tumor cell phenotypes associated with Rac deregulation . R ho family GTPases are molecular switches that control signal - ing pathways regulating cytoskeleton organization , gene ex - pression , cell cycle progression , cell motility , and other cellular processes ( 1 ) . They can be activated through the interaction with the Dbl family guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) that catalyzetheirGTP (cid:1) GDPexchangeandconnectthemtothediverse stimuli from upstream cell surface receptors such as the G protein - coupled receptors , growth factor receptors , cytokine receptors , and adhesion receptors ( 2 ) . Accumulating evidence has implicated Rho GTPases in many aspects of cancer development ( 3 – 6 ) , and de - regulated Rho GTPases have been discovered in many human tumors , including colon , breast , lung , myeloma , and head and neck squamous - cell carcinoma ( 7 – 11 ) . Rho GTPases and the signal pathways regulated by them have thus been proposed as potential anticancer therapeutic targets ( 12 ) . Because in many cases it is overexpression or up - regulation , not constitutively activating mu - tation , of individual Rho protein that is associated with tumorigenic properties or poor prognosis of cancer , one targeting strategy of a Rho GTPase signal pathway may come by inhibition of the Rho GTPase activation by its specific Dbl family GEF . Because the number of the Dbl family GEFs appears to far outnumber that of Rho GTPase substrates ( 2 ) , the signaling specificity mediated by Rho proteins is in part governed by specific GEF – Rho interactions . Recently available 3D structures of GEF – Rho protein complexes provided a wealth of information on the mechanism of GEF – Rho GTPase interactions ( 13 – 15 ) . In the previous structural mapping studies of Rac1 interaction with its GEFs , we and others have identified a groove formed by the switch I , switch II , and (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) (cid:1) 2 (cid:1) (cid:1) 3 regions of Rac1 as the key area involved in GEF specification and pinpointed residue Trp 56 as the critical determinant of Rac1 for discrimination by a subset of Rac1 - specific GEFs including Trio and Tiam1 ( 16 ) . The Rac1 mutant Rac1W56F lost its responsiveness and the ability to interact with Trio and Tiam1 , whereas the corresponding Cdc42 mutant Cdc42F56W gainedthesensitivitytoTrioandTiam1 ( 16 , 17 ) . Moreover , wehave shown that a polypeptide derived from Rac1 sequences containing Trp 56 can specifically inhibit GEF binding to Rac1 ( 16 ) , raising the possibility that the structural features surrounding Trp 56 of Rac1 might be explored for the design of an interfering reagent specif - ically blocking Rac1 activation by its GEF . In the present work , we have applied a structure - based virtual screening approach ( 18 ) to the search for a Rac – GEF interaction - specific small - molecule inhibitor . By screening the chemical library of National Cancer Institute we have identified a chemical com - pound , NSC23766 , that fits well into the GEF - recognition groove centering on Trp 56 of Rac1 . We show that NSC23766 acts as a Rac activation - specific inhibitor that could be useful for cell biological studies of Rac function and for therapeutic targeting at Rac deregulation . Experimental Procedures Virtual Screening . The UNITY program ( TriposAssociates , St . Louis ) was used to screen the National Cancer Institute database for chemical compounds that were able to fit into the Rac1 surface containing Trp 56 . The candidate compounds were then docked onto the Rac1 surface by using the program FLEXX ( Tripos Asso - ciates ) for energy minimization ( 19 ) . The chemical compounds displaying the highest binding affinities in the calculations were obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch , Devel - opmental Therapeutics Program , Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis , National Cancer Institute , for further experimental tests .

Results Virtual Screening for Rac - Specific Docking Compounds . In the 3D structure of the Rac1 – Tiam1 complex , Trp 56 of Rac1 is buried in a pocket formed by residues His 1178 , Ser1 184 , Glu 1183 , and Ile 1197 of Tiam1 and Lys 5 , Val 7 , Thr 58 , and Ser 71 of Rac1 ( 13 ) . To identify Rac1 - specific inhibitors based on the structural features surround - ing Trp 56 , a putative inhibitor - binding pocket was created with residuesofRac1within6 . 5ÅofTrp 56 intheRac1 - Tiam1monomer , including Lys 5 , Val 7 , Trp 56 , and Ser 71 . A 3D database search was performed to identify compounds whose conformations would fit into this pocket . The database we used was freely available from National Cancer Institute ( www . dtp . nih . gov ) , which includes the coordinates of (cid:3) 140 , 000 small chemical compounds . To take the flexibility of the compounds into consideration during the screen - ing process , the program UNITY , whose Directed Tweak algorithm allows a conformationally flexible 3D search ( 23 ) , was applied . The small - moleculehitsyieldedbythe UNITY programwerenextdocked into the predicted binding pocket of Rac1 containing Trp 56 by using the program FLEXX , an energy minimization modeling software that allows flexible docking to protein - binding sites ( 24 ) . By fol - lowing the docking procedures , the compounds were ranked based on their predicted ability to bind to the binding pocket with the program CSCORE . CSCORE generates a relative , consensus score based on how well the individual scoring functions of the protein – ligand complex perform ( 25 ) . Of the top 100 compounds that displayed high consensus scores , we crossed out 58 compounds whose docking did not seem to involve residue Trp 56 by visual inspection . Taking into account the solubility and availability of the remaining compounds , we focused on a set of 15 chemicals that show promising docking affinities by the scoring method for further characterization . Compound 23766 Specifically Inhibited Rac1 – GEF Interaction inVitro . The 15 chemical compounds generated by virtual screening were examined for their ability to inhibit the Rac1 - binding interaction with its GEF in a complex formation assay . For this purpose , TrioN , which specifically activates Rac1 but not Cdc42 ( 16 ) and Intersectin , a Cdc42 - specific GEF ( 17 ) , were used to assay the binding activity to their respective substrates in the presence of a 1 - mM concen - tration of each individual compound . As shown in Fig . 1 A , TrioN readily coprecipitated with GST - Rac1 but not with GST . Among the compounds tested , NSC23766 was the only one to significantly inhibit TrioN binding to Rac1 . The inhibitory effect of NSC23766 appeared to be specific for the interaction between Rac1 and its GEF because it did not interfere with the Cdc42 binding to Intersectin . The chemical structure of NSC23766 is shown in Fig . 7 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site . On examination of the docking model , it appears that the binding site for NSC23766 on Rac1 is a surface cleft formed by residues Lys 5 , Fig . 1 . IdentiﬁcationofNSC23766asaninhibitorofRac1 – Triointeraction . ( A upper ) The inhibitory effect of a panel of compounds predicted by virtual screening on Rac1 interaction with TrioN was tested in a complex formation assay . ( His ) 6 - tagged TrioN ( 0 . 5 (cid:2) g ) was incubated with GST alone or nucleoti - de - freeGST - Rac1 ( 2 (cid:2) g ) inthepresenceorabsenceof1mMindicatedNational Cancer Institute compound and 10 (cid:2) l of suspended glutathione - agarose beads . Afteranincubationat4°Cfor30min , thebeadsassociated ( His ) 6 - TrioN were detected by anti - His Western blotting . ( A Lower ) The effect of the compounds on Cdc42 binding to Intersectin was determined similarly ; (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) g of GST or GST - tagged Intersectin was incubated with the nucleotide - free , ( His ) 6 - tagged Cdc42 ( 0 . 25 (cid:2) g ) under similar conditions . Data are representa - tive of the results from four independent experiments . ( B ) A simulated dock - ing model of NSC23766 on Rac1 surface .

Mutation of most residues in this region impaired GEF binding and (cid:1) or catalysis . As shown in Fig . 1 C , Rac1L70A (cid:1) S71A retained binding to TrioN but lost the inhibitory response to NSC23766 , suggesting that the chemical may indeed use the pre - dicted docking pocket of Rac1 for the interference of GEF recog - nition . Further examination of NSC23766 revealed that it can inhibit Rac1 – TrioN interaction in a dose - dependent manner , achieving 50 % inhibition at (cid:1) 50 (cid:2) M under the GST pull - down conditions ( Fig . 2 A and Fig . 8 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . Increasing the GEF dose in the pull - down assay could significantly hinder the inhibitory effect ( data not shown ) , consistent with a competitive nature of the inhibitor action . To see whether the inhibitory activity of NSC23766 toward Rac – TrioN interaction could be extended to other Rac - specific GEF and whether the chemical interferes with the GEF interaction specifi - cally , we next tested its effect on Rac1 – Tiam1 , RhoA – PDZ - RhoGEF , Rac1 – BcrGAP , and Rac1 – PAK1 interactions . As shown in Fig . 2 B – D , the compound inhibited Tiam1 binding to Rac1 similarly to TrioN but had no detectable effect on RhoA binding to its GEF or PDZ - RhoGEF or on Rac1 binding to BcrGAP or effector PAK1 . These results suggest that NSC23766 is capable of specifically interfering with Rac1 – GEF interaction . To determine whether NSC23766 is active in specifically inhib - iting GEF - stimulated guanine nucleotide - exchange reaction of Rac1 , the mant - GDP (cid:1) GTP exchange assays of Rac1 , Cdc42 , and RhoAunderthecatalysisofTrioN , Intersectin , andPDZ - RhoGEF , respectively , were carried out in the presence of increasing doses of NSC23766 . As shown in Fig . 9 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site , the chemical was able to block the nucleotide exchange of Rac1 catalyzed by TrioN in a dose - dependent manner . The 50 % inhibitory dose came at (cid:1) 50 (cid:2) M , consistent with the inhibitory potency of the binding interaction ( Fig . 2 A ) . In contrast , the compound had little impact on the Intersectin - stimulated mant - GDP (cid:1) GTP exchange of Cdc42 or on the PDZ - RhoGEF - stimulated mant - GDP (cid:1) GTP exchange of RhoA at 200 (cid:2) M concentration ( Fig . 9 ) . These results demonstrate that NSC23766 is able to specifically inhibit the activation of Rac1 by its GEF in vitro . Specific Inhibitory Effect of NSC23766 on Rac1 Activity in Vivo . In fibroblasts , Rac1 can be activated by diverse stimuli , including serum and platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) ( 26 , 27 ) , and this activation is expected to be mediated by one or more Rac - specific GEFs , such as Tiam1 . To evaluate whether NSC23766 might affect Rac activity in vivo , NIH 3T3 cells grown in 10 % calf serum were treated with NSC23766 in different concentrations overnight , and the activation state of endogenous Rac1 in the cells was detected by an effector domain pull - down assay . As shown in Fig . 3 A , NSC23766 strongly inhibited Rac1 activation induced by serum , and the inhibitory effect of NSC23766 appeared to be specific toward Rac among Rho GTPases , because the activation states of Cdc42andRhoAinthesamecellswerenotaffectedbythepresenceofupto100 (cid:2) M NSC23766 ( Fig . 3 A ) . To examine whether NSC23766 can affect Rac1 activation by PDGF stimulation , serum - starved NIH 3T3 cells in the presence or absence of 50 or 100 (cid:2) M compound were challenged with 10 nM PDGF for 2 min , and the cell lysates were assayed for the amount of active Rac1 - GTP . Comparing with the Rac1 activity in the absence of NSC23766 , the cells treated with the compound showed a dose - dependent reduc - tion of Rac1 - GTP under PDGF stimulation . The presence of 100 (cid:2) M NSC23766 led to lower than basal level of Rac1 - GTP in the cells ( Fig . 3 B ) . Thus , consistent with the in vitro effect on the GEF reaction of Rac1 , NSC23766 was able to specifically inhibit Rac1 activation in vivo . PDGF activates Rac1 and induces Rac - mediated membrane ruffles and lamellipodia in fibroblasts ( 26 ) . To evaluate the ability of NSC23766 to inhibit Rac1 - mediated cell functions , we next examined the actin cytoskeleton structures of the cells stimulated by PDGF in the absence or presence of NSC23766 . As shown in Fig . 3 C , 10 nM PDGF potently stimulated membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation in Swiss 3T3 cells at both 5 - and 10 - min time lapses . However , in the presence of 50 (cid:2) M NSC23766 , PDGF was only marginally effective in inducing lamellipodia at the cell edges at 5 min and was ineffective at 10 min when control cells that were not treated with NSC23766 displayed significant lamellipodia struc - tures . Essentially all treated cells showed a loss of response to the PDGF stimulation at 10 min with (cid:1) 70 % displaying a complete loss of lamellipodia . These results further indicate that NSC23766 is effective in inhibiting Rac - mediated cellular events . Inhibition of Serum - or Rac GEF - Induced Cell Growth and Transfor - mation by NSC23766 . Rac1 activity is important for cell - growth regulation . Overexpression of dominant negative Rac1 could slow cellgrowth , whereasconstitutivelyactiveRac1increasedthegrowth rate of fibroblasts ( 28 ) . Because NSC23766 was able to decrease Rac1 activity in NIH 3T3 cells , we next examined its effect on the growth properties of wild - type NIH 3T3 cells and cells expressing a constitutively active Rac1 mutant , L61Rac1 . Comparison of the growth rates of the cells in the absence or presence of 50 (cid:2) M NSC23766 showed that the compound could slow the growth of wild - type cells without affecting the growth rate of L61Rac1 cells ( Fig . 4 A ) . The level of GTP - bound L61Racl remained unchanged with or without the compound treatment , whereas the endogenous Rac1 activity in the same cells deceased significantly by NSC23766 ( Fig . 4 A ) . These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of NSC23766 on cell growth is due to its ability to inhibit cellular Rac1 activity . Fig . 2 . Dose - dependent speciﬁc inhibition of GEF interaction with Rac1 by NSC23766 .

Dbl family GEFs are potent stimulators of cell proliferation because of their ability to directly activate their cognate Rho GTPase substrates . NSC23766 was capable of inhibiting cell growth induced by the Rac1 - specific GEF Tiam1 or TrioN ( Fig . 4 B and data not shown ) , but not that stimulated by the Rho - specific GEF Lbc , the Cdc42 - specific GEF Intersectin , or the more promiscuous GEF Vav that acts on Rac with a distinct mechanism ( Fig . 4 B and Fig . 10 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . Moreover , NSC23766 at 50 (cid:2) M concentration signifi - cantly inhibited the foci - forming activity of Tiam1 but not that of L61Rac1 ( Fig . 11 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) , and it decreased the Tiam1 - induced colony numbers and the size of colonies on soft agar ( Fig . 4 C ) . When applied to the oncogenic Ras ( V12H - Ras ) transformed cells , NSC23766 partially inhibited the colony - forming activity ( Fig . 4 D ) . These results further indicate that NSC23766 can act as a specific inhibitory reagent to reverse the cell - proliferative advantage attrib - uted to Rac activation . Reversal of PC - 3 Prostate Tumor Cell Phenotypes by NSC23766 . Elevation of Rac1 activity has been associated with cancer cell hyperproliferative and invasive properties . Next , we tested the effect of NSC23766 on the transformation and invasion activities of a prostate cancer cell line , PC - 3 . PC - 3 cells are malignant prostate adenocarcinomacellsderivedfromthebonemetastasesofapatientwithprostatecancer ( 29 ) . The mRNA of PTEN tumor suppressor was undetectable in these cells ( 30 ) , and loss of PTEN has previ - ously been associated with Rac1 hyperactivation because of the significant increase of phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate level ( 31 ) . Indeed , when the activity of endogenous Rac1 in PC - 3 cells was examined by probing with GST - PAK1 ( p21 - binding domain ) , a significantly higher level of GTP - bound Rac1 than that of normal prostate epithelial cell , RWPE - 1 , or the relatively indo - lent LNCaP cells was observed ( ref . 32 and data not shown ) . Inhibition of Rac1 activity in PC - 3 cells by expression of either the p21 - binding domain of PAK1 or a dominant negative Rac1 mutant could significantly suppress cell growth ( ref . 32 ; data not shown ) . Thus , we reasoned that the proliferative advantage and other tumor characteristics of PC - 3 cells might be mediated by hyperactive Rac1 in the cells , and inhibition of Rac1 activity may reverse some of the traits of PC - 3 cells . As shown in Fig . 5 A and B , treatment of PC - 3 cells with NSC23766 led to a dose - dependent inhibition of prolif - eration and anchorage - independent growth . The size of the colo - nies of treated cells appeared to be smaller and more compact than those of the untreated ones . Further , at 25 (cid:2) M , NSC23766 inhibited the PC - 3 cell invasion through Matrigel by 85 % ( Fig . 5 C ) . Both PC - 3 and RWPE - 1 cells remained viable under these conditions . Taken together , these results indicate that NSC23766 was effective in reversing the proliferation , anchorage - independent growth , and invasion phenotypes of PC - 3 tumor cells by interfering with Rac activation . Discussion Rho family GTPases are important intracellular signaling proteins that control diverse cellular functions related to cancer develop - ment , including actin cytoskeleton organization , transcription reg - ulation , cell cycle progression , apoptosis , vesicle trafficking , and cell - to - cell and cell - to - extracellular matrix adhesions ( 1 , 4 ) . They have emerged as potentially useful targets for tumorigenesis ( 12 ) . In particular , several lines of evidence indicate that the Rho family member , Rac , may play critical roles in several aspects of tumori - genesis and cancer progression . First , constitutively active Rac1 could accelerate cell growth and transform NIH 3T3 cells , whereas dominant negative Rac inhibited cell growth ( 28 ) . Second , Rac1 was found to be an important component of Ras - induced trans - formation ( 3 ) , and the Rac - specific GEF , Tiam1 , is involved in Ras - mediated skin cancer progression in mice ( 33 ) . Third , loss of function in PTEN , p19Arf , or p53 tumor suppressor leads to Fig . 3 . NSC23766 was effective in specif - ically inhibiting Rac1 activation in cells . ( A ) The activation states of endogenous Rac1 , Cdc42 , and RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells with or without NSC23766 treatment were de - tected by the effector pull - down assays . At 80 % conﬂuency in the presence of 10 % serum , NIH3T3cellsin100 - mmdisheswere treated with the indicated dosages of NSC23766 for 12 h . Cell lysates containing similar amounts of Rac1 , Cdc42 , or RhoA were incubated with the agarose - immobi - lized GST - PAK1 , GST - WASP , or GST - Rho - tekin , and the co - precipitates were sub - jectedtoanti - Rac1 , Cdc42orRhoAWestern blot analysis to reveal the amount of GTP - bound Rho proteins .

PNAS (cid:2) May 18 , 2004 (cid:2) vol . 101 (cid:2) no . 20 (cid:2) 7621 C E LL B I O L O G Y elevation of Rac activity , resulting increased migration and prolif - eration in PTEN (cid:4) / (cid:4) , p19Arf (cid:4) / (cid:4) , or p53 (cid:4) / (cid:4) cells ( 31 , 34 , 35 ) . Fourth , hyperactive Rac1 and Rac3 were associated with the increased proliferation of several breast cancer cell lines ( 8 , 10 ) . In addition , a point mutation of Tiam1 has been identified in human tumors , and this mutant was shown to transform NIH 3T3 cells ( 36 ) . Unlike Ras , however , constitutively active mutation of Rac has not been found in human cancer . It is possible that up - regulation or over - expression , rather than GTPase - defective mutation , of Rac is associated with tumorigenic properties . Therefore , the signaling step of Rac1 activation by GEF could be a targeting site of the signaling chains involving Rac . In previous work we have demonstrated that Trp 56 of Rac1 is the critical structural determinant specifying Rac1 recognition and responsiveness to a subset of Rac - specific GEFs ( 16 ) . A peptide derived from Rac1 sequences , including the Trp 56 residue , was able to block the interaction between Rac and several of Rac - specific GEFs without affecting the effector PAK1 binding . We speculated that the structural features of Rac1 in the region containing Trp 56 could be explored to design inhibitors to specifically interfere with Rac1 activation by GEFs . In the present study , based on the structural information provided by the Rac1 – Tiam1 complex and by taking the computer - simulated virtual screening approach , we have identified the small chemical compound of the National Cancer Institute chemical database , NSC23766 , as a Rac - specific inhibitor . We show that this compound was able to discriminate Rac1 from Cdc42 and RhoA and specifically inhibited Rac1 activation by its GEF in vitro and in vivo . We provide an example of application of this compound to a human cancer cell line , PC - 3 , and show that it was able to inhibit proliferation , anchorage - independent growth , and invasion of the Rac - hyperactive prostate cancer cells by down - regulating the endogenous Rac1 activity . To understand the inhibitory mechanism of NSC23766 on Rac1 , we examined the simulated model of NSC23766 docking on Rac1 Fig . 5 . NSC23766 inhibited the proliferation , anchorage - independent growth and invasion of PC - 3 prostate cancer cells . ( A ) PC - 3 cells were grown in 5 % calf serum supplemented with the indicated concentrations of NSC23766 . The cells were split in triplicate in 96 wells at 1 . 5 (cid:2) 10 3 cells per well .

In the model , the binding site for NSC23766 in Rac1 is a surface cleft formed by residues Lys 5 , Val 7 , Asp 38 , Asn 39 , Trp 56 , Asp 57 , Thr 58 , Leu 70 , and Ser 71 . The major bonding involved in the interaction between NSC23766 and Rac1 is hydrophobic in nature . The nitrogen atoms of NSC23766 form three hydrogen bonds with residues from the backbone of Rac1 , and the stacking effect of the middle pyrimidine ring of NSC23766 with the indole ring of Trp 56 may also contribute significantly to the interaction . We suspect that the interaction between Trp 56 and the aromatic ring of NSC23766 governs the binding specificity of 23766 , and the selectivity of Rac1 over Cdc42 by NSC23766 might be because the side chain of Trp 56 in Rac1 provides sufficient bonding for the recognition of NSC23766 , whereas the smaller side chain of Phe 56 in Cdc42 fails to establish a relatively high - affinity interaction with NSC23766 . Moreover , thebindingpocketofNSC23766inRac1islocatedatthe three - way junction site of switch I , switch II , and (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) (cid:1) 2 (cid:1) (cid:1) 3 , where it provides much of the binding surface for Tiam1 recognition in the Rac1 – Tiam1 crystal structure ( 13 ) . It is possible that NSC23766 may not only interfere with the interaction between (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) (cid:1) 2 (cid:1) (cid:1) 3 of Rac1 and Tiam1 , but also inhibit the interaction of the switch regions with Tiam1 . Such a docking model is supported by the Rac1 mutant results ( Fig . 1 C ) and our preliminary NMR 15 N - heteronuclear sequential quantum correlation chemical - shift per - turbation data obtained by titrating NSC23766 to the N 15 - labeled Rac1 . Thus , the strategic localization of the binding pocket could be the reason that NSC23766 is able to efficiently inhibit the activation of Rac1 by Trio or Tiam - 1 , and the specific binding of NSC23766 to Rac1 may involve the overall conformation of Trp 56 and its neighboring residues . As a first generation inhibitor for Rac , NSC23766 is capable of specifically interfering with Rac1 but with not Cdc42 or RhoA activation by their respective GEFs , as demonstrated by the in vitro binding and exchange assays ( Figs . 2 and 9 ) and the in vivo Rho GTPase effector domain pull - down assays ( Fig . 3 ) . The compound could further affect the downstream signaling events of Rac , such as membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation induced by upstream stimulus PDGF ( Fig . 3 ) . Consistent with its role as a competitive inhibitor of Rac activation , the effects of the compound on Rac1 activity and Rac - mediated cellular function appear to be reversible , because medium changes of the cells treated with NSC23766coulddiminishtheRac - inhibitoryeffect ( Y . G . andY . Z . , unpublished data ) . Although we cannot rule out the possibility that NSC23766 has additional targets in vivo , the facts ( i ) that it can specifically block cell growth stimulated by the Rac1 - specific Trio and Tiam1 , but not that caused by the RhoA or Cdc42 - specific Lbc and Intersectin , or by the more promiscuous Rho GTPase GEF Vav that utilizes a distinct mechanism to couple to Rac ( 37 , 38 ) and ( ii ) that it inhibited the cell growth stimulated by serum but not by that induced by the constitutively active L61Rac1 strongly suggest that NSC23766 may work specifically through interference of Rac1 activation to elicit its inhibitory effect on cells . The data we gathered of NSC23766 in fibroblast cells suggest that it might have antioncogenic potential in tumor cells . To demon - strate that NSC23766 might be useful to reverse tumor cell phe - notypes , we examined the prostate cancer PC - 3 cells that depend on hyperactive Rac1 activity for growth and invasion properties ( 32 ) , possibly because of the impairment of PTEN expression in these cells ( 30 ) . Application of NSC23766 to PC - 3 cells resulted in significant inhibition of proliferation , anchorage - independent growth , and invasion , indicating that interfering with Rac activation by NSC23766 is an encouraging approach for tumor cell repression . The results of this preliminary study open the door for further testing of this chemical in other tumor cell types in which Rac signaling is deregulated . In addition to the effect on cell growth and invasion , we noticed that NSC23766 was able to cause cell rounding and detachment from the matrix ( Y . G . and Y . Z . , unpublished data ) , possibly affecting cell adhesion mediated by Rac1 ( 39 ) . We also noticed a difference in dose dependence between PC - 3 cells and fibroblasts , which might reflect the difference in cell types in uptaking efficiency or dependence on Rac1 activity . A more detailed examination of the efficacy of the compound in various cell types is warranted to determine the optimal dose required for each cell system . To further improve the inhibitory effect of NSC23766 on Rac1 activation , we must attempt to modify the structure of NSC23766 to achieve a better fitting into the groove on the Rac1 surface and to increase the docking affinity . Recently , a small - molecule com - pound and its derivatives were discovered as inhibitors of Ras – Raf interaction by a forward two - hybrid screening ( 40 ) . These com - pounds could reverse the transformation phenotypes induced by Ras in several cancer cell lines at a concentration of (cid:1) 20 (cid:2) M . Rac acts further downstream of Ras and contributes to Ras transfor - mation . NSC23766 can partially inhibit oncogenic Ras - induced cell transformation , raising an attractive possibility that it might work synergistically with the Ras – Raf interaction inhibitors to effectively reverse Ras - mediated tumorigenesis because Rac1 and Raf are involvedindifferentaspectsofRas - mediatedgrowthregulation ( 3 ) .
