Molecular characteristics of the edge cells responsible for expansion of the chick embryo on the vitelline membrane Hyung Chul Lee , Yara Fadaili and Claudio D .

Surpris - ingly , this has not yet been studied in detail . Here we explore the edge cells of the chick embryo using in situ hybridization , immunohistochemistry and live imaging . Morphological and molecular properties reveal that the edge has a distinctive structure , being subdivided into sub - regions , includ - ing at least four distinct zones ( which we name as leading , trailing , deep and stalk zones ) . This allows us to study reorganization of the edge region that accompanies reattachment of an explanted blastoderm to the VM . Immunohistochemistry uncovers distinct polarized cellular features resembling the process of collective cell migration described in other sys - tems . Live imaging reveals dynamic lamellipodial and filopodial activity at the leading edge of the outermost cells . Our data provide evidence that edge cells are a distinct tissue . We propose that edge cells may be a useful model system for the study of wound healing and other closure events in epithelial cell sheets . 1 . Introduction During the first few days of development of the chick embryo , the extra - embryonic tissue ( initially called the ‘ area opaca ’ ) at the periphery of the flat blastoderm gradually expands until , about 4 days ’ incubation after egg laying , it covers the entire surface of the spherical yolk mass . This represents more than a 200 - fold increase in surface area and a rate of expansion of 200 – 550 µm h − 1 [ 1 ] ( figure 1 a ) . This expansion is driven by specialized cells located at the extreme edge of the embryo , which are the only cells that adhere to the inner ( yolk - facing ) surface of the vitelline membrane ( VM ) . This narrow ring of cells has been called ‘ margin of overgrowth ’ [ 2 ] and spans approximately 40 – 60 µm [ 1 , 3 – 5 ] . Several requirements need to be met for proper expansion of the blastoderm and normal embryo development . First , the attachment of this edge is required for blastoderm expansion and their outgoing movement generates and maintains tension in the embryo [ 4 – 6 ] , which rises to a peak at around 20 – 24 h ’ incubation [ 1 ] . Second , tension in the acellular VM that constitutes the substrate for this expansion is also important for normal embryo development [ 4 – 6 ] . In addition , the orientation of both the embryo and the VM is important . For example , on an inverted VM , the embryo becomes abnormally strongly attached to the outer VM and does not expand , while an inverted blastoderm develops into a hollow vesicle probably by folding of the edge , allowing attachment of the dorsal side of the edge cells to the VM , on which they crawl to seal to form a sphere [ 5 ] . Cells at the edge of the embryo change their shape from initially cuboidal multiple layers to later a squamous and flattened monolayer [ 1 , 3 ] . The extreme © 2022 The Authors .

Perhaps paradoxically given the rapid expansion of the circumference at this time , the extreme edge cells do not appear to proliferate [ 3 , 7 ] .

The edge cells have unique cellular morphologies that are related to their adhesiveness and migration . At their distal face , broad and flattened cell - processes adhere to the inner VM [ 8 , 9 ] . Incubation of embryos in small peptide inhibitors of adhesion to fibronectin causes transient detachment of the embryo from the VM and arrest of expansion for a short time , suggesting that fibronectin is involved in the adhesion of the embryo to the VM [ 10 ] . Chemical inhibition of microtubules also affects blastoderm expansion [ 11 , 12 ] . Apart from this , we know very little about the mechanisms of chick blastoderm expansion . In this study , we revisit chick embryo expansion and study its molecular characteristics . We reveal molecular markers expressed in different sub - domains of the edge region . We show that when an embryo is removed from its membrane and then replaced onto it , reattachment is accompanied by an increase in the number of cells with edge cell properties ( including molecular markers ) , suggesting that reattachment involves reorganization of the tissue . We use immunohisto - chemistry to explore various cellular properties including cell polarity , proliferation and proteins involved in cell adhesion — these are strongly reminiscent of similar properties described for cells undergoing collective cell migration in other systems . Finally , high - resolution live imaging reveals dynamic morphological changes of the most distal , leading - edge cells . 2 . Results and discussion 2 . 1 . Markers for the edge cells No specific markers for edge cells have yet been described in any avian species . To find candidate genes that are specifically expressed in the edge region , we first examined whole - mount in situ hybridization datafrom previous studies ( including [ 13 ] and data for a large number of genes from our laboratory ) . This revealed eight genes that are specifically expressed or highly enriched at the rim of the embryo : RNH1 , SNAI2 , DACT2 , MSX1 , TGM4 , GATA2 , LHX1 and DKK1 ( table 1 ) . To investigate these in more detail , we performed in situ hybridization on embryos incubated for 24 h ( approximately HH stage 5 – 7 embryos [ 14 ] . In dorsal view , all the genes showed localized expression in the outermost 2 – 3 cells all around the periphery of the embryo ( figure 1 c – f and k – n ) ; in the case of MSX1 and TGM4 , expression was also seen in non - edge proximal cells ( figure 1 k , f ) . Histological sections of these embryos revealed distinctive expression patterns of the markers for cells located at slightly different positions within the edge region . This allows classification of four distinct regions , which we name leading ( at the leading / free edge , and adjacent to the VM ) , trailing ( also adjacent to the VM but just behind the leading cells ) , deep ( underlying the trailing zone , towards the yolk ) and stalk zones ( also deep , towards the yolk but further removed from the leading edge ) ( figure 1 b ) . The cells in all four zones have flattened mor - phology and much larger nuclei and cell size compared to other area opaca cells more distant from the edge ( non - edge cells ) , but the four zones differ from each other . Extensive membrane ruffles are seen particularly in the leading zone , extending mostly towards the direction of migration ( figure 1 b ) . Cells in the stalk zone provide a connection between the edge region and non - edge cells ( figure 1 b ) . This classification reveals quite specific expression patterns for the eight markers ( table 2 ) . Figure 1 c – r shows representa - tive images in dorsal and sectioned view . RNH1 and SNAI2 are expressed in all edge cells but more weakly in the leading zone ( figure 1 c , d , g , h ) . DACT2 is expressed specifically in upper cells ( leading and trailing zones , adjacent to the VM ) but not in cells in the deep zone ( figure 1 e , i ) . MSX1 is specifically expressed in the stalk zone ( as well as in neighbouring non - edge cells ) , but absent in all the other edge sub - regions ( figure 1 f , j ) . TGM4 is expressed strongly in the trailing zone but weakly in the other edge zones and non - edge cells ( figure 1 k , o ) . Both GATA2 and LHX1 are expressed exclusively in the trailing zone furthest from the leading edge ( 1 cell thick ) ( figure 1 l , m , p , q ) , while the latter showed mosaic ( hetero - geneous ) expression in the trailing zone furthest from the leading edge ( figure 1 m ) . DKK1 is expressed in the trailing zone and also occasionally in stalk zone ( figure 1 n , r ) . To con - firm these results , we used double in situ hybridization to visualize the expression of either RNH1 with MSX1 , or of DACT with LHX1 , in the same embryos . RNH1 and MSX1 are expressed in separate regions : RNH1 in all edge cells except in the stalk zone , while MSX1 is expressed exclusively in the stalk zone ( figure 1 s , t , w , y ) . The expression of DACT2 and LHX1 overlaps , the latter being heterogeneous ( mosaic ) in the rearmost cells of the trailing zone ( figure 1 u , v , x , z ) . Next , to investigate if these patterns of expression are maintained throughout the process of expansion , two more stages , 12 h ( approx . HH stage 2 – 3 , an early stage of Table 1 .

HH stage 19 , when the edge has passed the equator and is now close to the South pole of the yolk ) , were investigated for expression of RNH1 , SNAI2 , DACT2 and MSX1 . At 12 h , three of the markers ( RNH1 , SNAI2 and DACT2 ) are expressed strongly in edge cells , while MSX1 is expressed in the stalk zone and non - edge cells ( electronic supplementary material , figure S1A – L ) , which is comparable to 24 h embryos in figure 1 . Unlike 24 h embryos , expression of RNH1 , SNAI2 and DACT2 in non - edge cells is also observed ( electronic supplementary material , figure S1I – J ) . Also , the edge region as a whole at 12 h contains fewer cells in thickness ( electronic supplementary material , figure S1E – L ) compared to 24 h ( figure 1 ) . On the other hand , at 3 days ( electronic supplementary material , figure S1M ) , the edge shows fairly regular , marked infoldings , suggesting that this may be a mechanism for reducing the circumference of the blastoderm edge as embryo expansion reaches its end ( electronic supplementary material , figure S1N ) . All four markers are specifically expressed in the edge cells , but MSX1 is only expressed in the stalk ( electronic supplementary material , figure S1O – Z ) . At 3 days of incu - bation , the edge has thickened , involving more cell layers , in comparison with a very thin , one - cell layer of non - edge cells ( electronic supplementary material , figure S1S – Z ) . This could be an additional mechanism contributing to reducing the circumference of the edge as expansion around the yolk nears completion . These results reveal that , throughout embryo expansion , edge cells maintain expression of the markers while they change their cellular composition , suggesting that some of these genes may have a role in the migration of the edge cells . Together , our data reveal that the edge region of the embryo can be subdivided into at least four regions using different markers ( table 1 ) , implying different biological prop - erties of edge cells in each zone and defining a distinctive structure for the edge region as a whole . 2 . 2 . Reorganization of the edge region during reattachment process Next , we investigated the behaviour of the edge region that accompanies attachment to the VM , using the newly found markers . Embryos were detached from the VM , kept in saline for 30 min before replacing them on the VM and incubation for different periods of time , followed by in situ hybridization to check the expression of edge cell markers ( figure 2 ) . RNH1 and SNAI2 were selected as they are expressed in all four zones , while DACT2 and MSX1 were selected because they mark upper edge cells and cells in the stalk zone , respectively . Several distinct features were observed during the reattach - ment process . First , three of the four markers ( RNH1 , SNAI2 and DACT2 ) are upregulated in non - edge cells just proximal to the edge soon ( 30 min ) after detachment from the VM ( figure 2 a , g , m , y – aa ) . Second , all four genes gradually expand their expression domains during culture , from a width of 2 – 3 cells before culture to a maximum of 10 cell diameters from the edge as seen in dorsal view , and 4 – 6 cells in depth as shown by sections after 2 h ( figure 2 a – x , ab – ae ) . The greatest rate of expansion occurs by 2 h ( figure 2 d , j , p , v ) . This expansion of the expression domains depends on attachment to the VM , as embryos kept in saline for 2 h showed only weak expression and no expansion of the expression domains ( figure 2 f , l , r , x ) . Finally , during reattachment , the marker genes maintain their expression pattern ( spatial expression in different zones ) regardless of the extra thickness due to additional cell layers ( figure 2 ab – ae ) . For example , RNH1 and SNAI2 , which are initially expressed in all four zones , are still expres - sed throughout the edge after reattachment ( figure 2 ab , ac ) . DACT2 maintains its expression , limited to the upper cell layer ( figure 2 ad ) , and MSX1 is expressed in rear cells ( like the stalk zone ) but is absent from distal cells ( figure 2 ae ) . The cell morphology , including nuclear shape , of edge cells quickly becomes rounded after detachment ( figure 2 y – aa ) and does not fully recover even several hours after reattachment ( figure 2 ab – ae ) . Some of the leading cells start to flatten again at 1 h and most of them have done so 2 h after replacing the embryo on the VM ( figure 2 ab – ae ) . Figure 2 af presents a schematic summary of the cellular changes seen during the reattachment process . Additionally , the increased adhesion to the VM was also apparent by the embryo retaining its association with the membrane even after the harsh in situ hybridization process from 2 h onwards . Attachment of non - edge cells was frequently observed at multiple points ( electronic supplementary material , figure S2A , C ) . Occasionally , the edge folded back on itself , and the ventral face of the edge region became attached to the VM ( electronic supplementary material , figure S2B ) . Table 2 .

Cellular properties of edge cells : cell polarity , extracellular matrix , the cytoskeleton and proliferation Cells that migrate collectively have unique cellular properties : the cells in the leading zone exhibit filopodial and lamellipo - dial activity at their leading face while keeping adhesion at their lateral and rear faces to cells that follow them , which in some cases defines a distinct structure comprising a group of cells that migrate collectively as a unit , which has been considered as a ‘ giant supracell ’ [ 15 , 16 ] . To investigate this in chick edge cells , immunohistochemistry was con - ducted to visualize the spatial distribution of a variety of cellular components ( figures 3 and 4 ) . First , we checked the localization of cell polarity markers in the edge cells . PKC ζ is localized apically in epithelialized cells in the early chick embryo [ 13 ] . In non - edge cells of the area opaca , it is also localized apically , but is not detectable in the edge cells ( figure 3 a ) , suggesting that the latter lack apical - basal polarity . RHOA and RAC1 , members of the Rho family of small GTPases that regulate actin dynamics , show localized expression in migrating cells [ 17 , 18 ] . In the edge cells , both of them show strong localization in the ventral - facing protrusions and elsewhere in the cytoplasm ( figure 3 b , c ) . Similar protrusions can be seen in a subset of non - edge cells in the outer area opaca ( figure 3 b , c ) . E - cadherin and CTNNB are components of adherens junctions [ 19 ] ; they are absent from the leading face of the edge cells but strongly expressed at junctions between non - edge cells ( figure 3 d , e ) , as after detachment R N H 1 S N A I 2 D A C T 2 M S X 1 30min 1h 2h 4h 2h in saline after culture on the vitelline membrane RNH 1 SNAI 2 DACT 2 RNH 1 normal embryo vitelline membrane ( VM ) expression of RNH1 and SNAI2 in edge cells upreguation of RNH1 and SNAI2 in non - edge cells increase in the number of RNH1 - and SNAI2 - expressing edge cells detachment from the VM re - attachment to the VM ( ae ) ( ad ) ( ac ) ( ab ) ( y ) ( z ) ( aa ) ( af ) SNAI 2 DACT 2 MSX 1 a f t e r d e t ac h m e n t 2 – 4h ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) ( f ) ( g ) ( h ) ( i ) ( j ) ( k ) ( l ) ( m ) ( n ) ( o ) ( p ) ( q ) ( r ) ( s ) ( t ) ( u ) ( v ) ( w ) ( x ) Figure 2 . Reorganization of the edge during reattachment . Embryos at HH stage 6 were detached from VM and then cultured by replacing them onto the VM for different time periods before assessing the expression of edge cell markers RNH1 , SNAI2 , DACT2 and MSX1 . As controls , ( f , l , r , x ) show the expression of the same four genes in embryos incubated in suspension in saline for 2 h . After detachment , the former three makers are induced weakly in non - edge cells proximal to the edge region ( arrowheads in ( y – aa ) ) . During reattachment , all genes show a gradual increase in the width of the expression domain , especially from 2 h after culture ( d , j , p , v ) . During reattachment , there is an increase in cell layers in the edge , including expression of RNH1 , SNAI2 and DACT2 ( ab – ad ) . From 2 h , the front - most edge cells flatten ( arrows in ( ab , ac ) ) . DACT2 expression is limited to upper edge cells ( ad ) . The expression of MSX1 is absent from the front edge cells ( bracket , ( ae ) ) . Dashed magenta lines : ventral side of VM . Black arrows : attachment points of the embryo to the VM .

Perhaps surprisingly given the rapid expansion of the embryo , we could observe no phospho - histone H3 - positive cells in the edge cells indicating that the edge cells may not be proliferating ; by contrast , there are many positive cells in non - edge regions ( figure 3 f ) . This is consistent with a previous study that showed that edge cells do not incorporate BrdU [ 7 ] . Next , we investigated markers of the ECM and for cellular components that participate in cell - substrate adhesion ( figure 4 a – f ) . Fibronectin , normally expressed basally in epi - thelial cells as a continuous sheet [ 20 ] , is expressed as a sheet under non - edge cells ( figure 4 a , b ) . However , in sections through edge cells , staining is sparse , consistent with organiz - ation as cables oriented parallel to the direction of migration [ 21 ] ( figure 4 a , c ) . Another ECM molecule , laminin , shows punctate staining in edge cells ( figure 4 f ) as previously reported [ 7 ] . The ECM receptors ITGA6 and ITGB1 are strongly and specifically localized to the edge cells ( figure 4 d , e ) . As most migrating cells exhibit unique cytoskeletal dynamics [ 15 ] , we investigated markers of some of these . α - tubulin staining reveals a mesh - like structure in the lamelli - podia of the leading - edge cells , while supracellular cables ( 2 – 3 cells thick ) perpendicular to the migration direction can be observed at the border between edge cells and non - edge cells ( figure 4 g ) . Phospho - MYL2 and F - actin ( phalloidin ) staining reveals 2 – 3 layers of supracellular cables ( actomyosin cables ) in the edge cells ( figure 4 h , i ) , suggesting tension perpendicular to the direction of migration [ 15 ] . Punctate localization of phos - pho - MYL2 was also observed at the free margin of the leading - edge cells ( arrowhead , figure 4 h ) . The expression of F - actin is strong in the edge cells , mostly in the cytoplasm ( figure 4 i ) . Together , these immunohistochemistry data demonstrate unique molecular features of the edge cells compared to neighbouring non - edge cells . 2 . 4 .

First , we immersed the entire embryo in a lipophilic dye , CM - DiI ( CellTracker ) to label all cell membranes ; this revealed details of lamellipodial and filopodial actions at the membranesofedgecells ( figure5 a – d ; electronicsupplementary material , movie S1 ) . Lamellipodia were constantly generated and resorbed at the migratory front of the outermost edge cell ( figure 5 a – d ; electronic supplementary material , movie S1 ) . Numerous very thin filopodia grew out from the periphery of the lamellipodia ( figure 5 a , b , d ; electronic supplementary material , movie S1 ) , as previously reported [ 10 ] . Rapid changes inlocalfluorescence intensitywere observedin theselamellipo - dia , resembling the focal adhesion points of migrating cells [ 22 , 23 ] ( figure 5 b ; electronic supplementary material , movie S1 ) . As the edge cell moves forward , the lamellipodia retract away from the direction of migration , while filopodia keep their attachment to the VM and do not retract . This suggests a possible combinatorial action of the lamellipodia and filopodia of the edge cells for their migration , as shown in a model of rapid wound healing [ 24 ] . Next , we stained the embryo with Calcein - AM ( figure 5 e – g ) . This revealed details of lamellipodial action and clearly marks the width of the edge region ( red brackets in figure 5 e – g ; electronic supplementary material , movieS2 ) . Our dataconfirmthatverydynamicchangesinmor - phology take place at the outermost front of the edge cells during chick embryo expansion . In conclusion , we describe some cellular and molecular characteristics of the edge region , specialized for blastoderm expansion on the VM . This reveals that the region is made up of at least four molecularly and anatomically distinct zones . The molecular markers hint at possible roles of WNT signal - ling . We propose that the edge region could be a useful model to study other general processes , such as wound heal - ing and cancer cell metastasis , which appear to involve similar migratory behaviours . 3 .

To keep the VM attached to the embryo , fixation was carried out as a series of sequential steps during embryo harvest . After opening the egg shell , the embryo was brought to the top by rolling the yolk with a spatula . Two to three drops of 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in calcium - magnesium free phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) ( pH7 . 4 ) were applied to cover the embryo and the adja - cent VM . After 5 – 10 s , an area of VM slightly larger than the embryo was cut and lifted out with a spoon - spatula . Two to three drops of 4 % PFA were applied directly to the embryo on the spatula for another 5 – 10 s . Embryos still attached to their membrane were cleared of adherent yolk while sub - merged in Pannett - Compton saline [ 25 ] using streams of saline from a glass Pasteur pipette . They were then fixed in 4 % PFA either at 4°C overnight prior to whole - mount in situ hybridization , or at room temperature for 1 h prior to immunohistochemistry . Whole - mount in situ hybridization was performed as previously described [ 26 , 27 ] . The probes used were RNH1 ( ChEST73n20 ) , SNAI2 [ 28 ] , DACT2 [ 29 ] , MSX1 [ 30 ] , TGM4 ( ChEST698a23 ) , GATA2 [ 31 ] , LHX1 ( ChEST389n6 ) and DKK1 [ 32 ] . For double in situ hybri - dization , the first probe was labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate and cyan colour development was done with 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolyl phosphate ( BCIP ) only . The second probe was labelled with digoxigenin and dark purple colour development was done with nitro blue tetrazo - lium plus BCIP . After imaging as whole mounts , embryos were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 10 µm in a Zeiss Microm microtome . Sections were mounted with Vectashield Plus antifade mounting medium which contains 4 0 , 6 - diami - dino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) ( H - 2000 , Vector Laboratories ) as a nuclear stain .

Live imaging Two different dyes were used for live staining of embryos and imaging ; CM - DiI ( C7001 , Invitrogen ) and Calcein - AM ( 17783 , Sigma - Aldrich ) . For CM - DiI staining , embryos were incubated in PBS containing 4 µM CM - DiI in 0 . 2 % dimethyl formamide in Pannett - Compton saline at 38°C for 30 min and then washed with PBS three times . The embryo was then cultured using a modification of the New culture method [ 33 , 34 ] at 38°C for at least 1 h . For Calcein - AM stain - ing , the embryos were first set - up for culture , and then a few drops of 10 µM Calcein - AM in PBS were applied to the edge region of the embryos . The embryo was then imaged with a Leica SPE inverted confocal microscope at 38°C . 3 . 3 . Immunohistochemistry and antibodies For whole - mount immunostaining , fixed embryos were dehydrated with ice - cold methanol and then rehydrated gradually in steps by adding PBS containing 1 % Triton X - 100 ( PBST ) . After further washing three times for 15 min with PBST , they were blocked with blocking buffer ( PBST containing 5 % normal goat serum and 0 . 02 % thimerosal ) for 2 – 6 h at room temperature on a rocker . The embryos were then incubated at 4°C for 2 – 3 days with primary anti - bodies : PKC ζ ( SC - 216 , Santa Cruz ) , RHOA ( SC - 179 , Santa Cruz ) , RAC1 ( 05 - 389 , Millipore ) , E - cadherin ( 610182 , BD Bio - sciences ) , β - catenin ( C7207 , Sigma ) , phospho - H3 ( 06 - 570 , Millipore ) , laminin ( 31 or 31 - 2 , Developmental Studies Hybri - doma Bank , DSHB ) , α - tubulin ( 2125S , Cell Signaling Technology ) and phospho - MYL2 ( 3674S , Cell Signaling Tech - nology ) , all diluted 1 : 400 except the DSHB antibodies which were diluted 1 : 10 . After washing three times with PBST , the embryos were incubated at 4°C for 1 day with fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies : Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG ( A21202 , Invitrogen ) , Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG ( A11008 , Invitrogen ) or Cy3 - conjugated anti - mouse IgG ( 115 - 165 - 073 , Jackson ) , all diluted 1 : 200 . For filamentous actin staining , embryos were incubated with rhodamine - phalloidin ( Invitrogen R415 ) . For fibronectin staining ( VA1 , DSHB ) , integrin - α 6 ( P2C62C4 , DSHB ) and integrin - β 1 ( V2E9 , DSHB ) , fixed embryos were embedded in paraffin and sectioned , then antigen retrieval was conducted in 10 mM sodium citrate ( pH 6 ) for 10 min at 98°C . Then , sectioned tissues were incubated for 1 day at 4°C with primary antibodies , and for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies . For nuclear staining , 2 . 5 µg ml − 1 of DAPI was applied to the embryos or sections for 10 min and then washed thoroughly . For whole embryo mounting , the embryo was transferred onto a slide dorsal side - up and flattened carefully , then the excessive solution was removed using a paper tissue . Twenty microlitres of mounting medium ( H - 1000 - 10 , VECTASHIELD ) were applied before covering with a coverslip . The stained embryos and sectioned tissues were imaged with a Leica SPE1 confocal microscope . The images were processed using Fiji software [ 35 ] to obtain a maximum projection or a slice view .
