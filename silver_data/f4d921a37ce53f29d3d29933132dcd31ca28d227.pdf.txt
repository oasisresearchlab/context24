ESCRT - III is composed of four protein subunits that are mono - meric in the cytosol and oligomerize into a protein lattice only upon membrane binding . Recent studies have shown that the ESCRT - III protein Snf7 can form a ﬁlament by undergoing homo - oligomerization . To examine the role of membrane binding and of interac - tions with other ESCRT components in initiating Snf7 oligomerization , we used ﬂuorescence spectroscopy to directly detect and characterize the assembly of the Snf7 oligomer on liposomes using puriﬁed ESCRT components . The observed ﬂuorescence changes reveal an obligatory sequence of membrane - protein and protein - protein interactions that generate the active conformation of Snf7 . Also , we demonstrate that ESCRT - III assembly drives membrane deforma - tion . Furthermore , usinganinvitrodisassemblyassay , we directly demonstrate that Vps24 and Vps2 function as adaptors in the ATP - dependent membrane disas - sembly of the ESCRT - III complex by recruiting the AAA ATPase Vps4 . INTRODUCTION A number of seemingly unrelated biological processes such as multivesicular body ( MVB ) biogenesis , cytokinesis , and retroviral budding require the ESCRT ( endosomal sorting complex required for transport ) machinery . In contrast to the formation of secretory and endocytic vesicles , where membrane budding occurs into the cytosol , MVB formation requires membrane budding away from the cytosol . The cellular machinery respon - sible for MVB formation under normal and pathological condi - tions is comprised of a subset of vacuolar protein sorting ( Vps ) gene products that were ﬁrst implicated in receptor downregula - tion via the MVB pathway ( Hurley , 2008 ; Saksena et al . , 2007 ; Williams and Urbe , 2007 ) . The majority of these Vps proteins are constituents of ﬁve separate heteromeric protein complexes called ESCRT - 0 , ESCRT - I , ESCRT - II , ESCRT - III , and the Vps4 AAA - ATPase complex ( Hurley , 2008 ; Williams and Urbe , 2007 ) . These complexes are transiently recruited from the cytoplasm to the endosomal membrane , where they function sequentially in sorting ubiquitinated transmembrane proteins into the MVB pathway . During the process of MVB sorting , ESCRT - 0 , ESCRT - I , and ESCRT - II are recruited to the endosomal membrane as stable hetero - oligomeric complexes from the cytosol . In contrast , the ESCRT - III proteins ( Vps20 , Snf7 , Vps24 , and Vps2 ) remain monomeric in the cytosol , and only upon membrane binding oligomerize into an ESCRT - III lattice of indeterminate stoichiom - etry . The fact that the ESCRT - III complex is comprised of four protein subunits that undergo a membrane - dependent mono - mer to hetero - oligomer transition raises a number of mechanistic questions , including ( 1 ) what is the order of membrane recruit - ment and assembly for each of the ESCRT - III proteins and ( 2 ) what are the molecular signals that prevent premature assembly of the ESCRT - III complex in the cytosol and direct assembly on the membrane ? Genetic and biochemical studies in yeast have provided some clues regarding the order of membrane recruitment of the indi - vidual ESCRT - III proteins . Vps20 is the ﬁrst ESCRT - III protein to associate with ESCRT - II on the endosome . Endosomal recruit - ment of the Vps24 - Vps2 subcomplex appears to be dependent on the Vps20 - Snf7 subcomplex , thereby indicating that the two subcomplexesarerecruitedsequentially ( Teisetal . , 2008 ) . Recy - cling of membrane - bound ESCRT complexes into the cytosol has been shown to involve interactions between Vps2 and the AAA - ATPase Vps4 ( Obita et al . , 2007 ; Stuchell - Brereton et al . , 2007 ) . Although it is challenging to determine the precise stoichiom - etry and molecular architecture of a membrane - bound protein lattice , studies on hSnf7 - 1 ( CHMP4A ) have shown that overex - pressed hSnf7 - 1 / CHMP4A spontaneously forms membrane - attached ﬁlaments 5 nm in width that curve and self - associate to create circular arrays that can promote or stabilize negative membrane curvature and outward budding of plasma membrane tubules ( Hanson et al . , 2008 ) . These data indicate that a single ESCRT - III protein can form an ESCRT - III lattice , presumably by Snf7 binding to itself . This possibility is further supported by observations that Snf7 is the most abundant ESCRT - III subunit Cell 136 , 97 – 109 , January 9 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 97 in yeast ( Teis et al . , 2008 ) and that most Snf7 isoforms self - asso - ciate in yeast two - hybrid analyses ( reviewed in Saksena et al . , 2007 ) . ESCRT - III assembly is spatially restricted to the endosomal membrane by the upstream ESCRT complexes ( ESCRT - 0 , - I , and - II ) , which selectively bind ubiquitin - modiﬁed transmem - brane cargo and the endosomally enriched lipid phosphatidyli - nositol 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) . There is growing evidence that activation of ESCRT - III subunits for assembly into the membrane - bound ESCRT - III complex requires a conformational switch . All of the ESCRT - III subunits are similar in size ( 221 – 241 residues ) and domain organization , with N - terminal basic and C - terminal acidic regions ( Saksena et al . , 2007 ) . Hence , the crystal structure of hVps24 / CHMP3 ( residues 9 – 183 ) reveals structural elements that are probably common to all ESCRT - III subunits ( Muzio 1 et al . , 2006 ) . Five alpha helices ( a 1 – a 5 ) span most of the N - terminal two - thirds of the protein and are con - nected by a relatively long linker to a sixth short predicted helix ( a 6 ) near the C terminus ( a 6 and the loop linking a 5 to a 6 were not seen in the crystal structure , indicating conformational ﬂexi - bility ) . The most prominent structural element observed in the crystal structure is the N - terminal helical hairpin that is 70 A˚ long and composed of helices a 1 and a 2 , which are critical for membrane binding and homo - or heterodimerization events ( Muzio 1 et al . , 2006 ) . The C - terminal region that includes helix a 5 , the microtubule - interacting and transport ( MIT ) - interacting region ( MIR ) , and a 6 constitutes a putative autoinhibitory region that is thought to interact with helix a 2 of the core and thereby block homo - or heterodimerization of ESCRT - III components ( Shim et al . , 2007 ) . Such intramolecular interactions may there - fore prevent ESCRT - III - ESCRT - III intermolecular association and thereby maintain the ESCRT - III proteins as metastable monomers in the cytosol in a ‘‘closed’’ state . ESCRT - III protein assembly may then occur only upon recruitment to endosomes , where the autoinhibitory intramolecular interaction is lost during a putative ‘‘closed’’ to ‘‘open’’ state transition that now permits ESCRT - III proteins to associate . The molecular trigger for the proposed release of this inhibition and ESCRT - III assembly on endosomal membranes remains unclear . Here , we have employed primarily ﬂuorescence spectroscopy to directly examine the molecular requirements for the assembly and disassembly of a Snf7 ( ESCRT - III ) polymer in vitro using puriﬁed components . Probes at several different positions were monitored spectroscopically under near - native aqueous conditions to detect changes in probe environment and also their sensitivity to different ESCRT components and membranes . The observed spectral changes indicate that upon membrane binding ( 1 ) the conformations of both Vps20 and Snf7 change ; ( 2 ) these conformations are further altered upon association with , respectively , Vps25 and Vps20 ; ( 3 ) most of the surface of the Snf7 molecule is in contact with the membrane surface ; ( 4 ) the C - terminal end of Snf7 moves adjacent to the bilayer except inmutantswithrestrictedconformationalﬂexibility ; ( 5 ) Snf7mole - cules oligomerize only in the presence of both membranes and Vps20 ; and ( 6 ) this oligomerization event is critical for membrane deformation . The combined data strongly suggest that these ESCRT - III interactions dictate an obligatory sequence of assembly reactions during formation of the ESCRT - III complex . Furthermore , we demonstrate that disassembly of the membrane - bound Snf7 oligomer requires Vps24 and Vps2 , which function as adaptors for ESCRT - III disassembly by capping the Snf7 oligomer and providing an entry point for the AAA - ATPase Vps4 . RESULTS Experimental Strategy To monitor the conformation , environment , and interactions of a single protein during the assembly and disassembly of the multi - component , membrane - bound ESCRT - III complex , the Cys - free Vps20 and Snf7 proteins were each modiﬁed by the replacement of a single amino acid with Cys . Cys substitutions were made at sites that lie within domains predicted to have functional impor - tance ( autoinhibitory loop , membrane binding , etc . ) and are solvent exposed ( based on the hVps24 crystal structure ) to enhance the efﬁciency of covalent modiﬁcation . Importantly , the introduction of a single Cys at different locations in monocys - teine mutants had no effect on the folding and function of Vps20 orSnf7sincecellsexpressingthedifferentcysteinemutantswere able to sort MVB cargo ( GFP - CPS ) to the vacuolar lumen ( Fig - ure S1 available online ) . A ﬂuorescent 7 - nitrobenz - 2 - oxa - 1 , 3 - diazole ( NBD ) dye was then covalently attached to the Cys in each derivative . NBD is small , uncharged , and its O and N atoms have sufﬁcient polar character for the dye to be soluble and exist stably in both aqueous and nonaqueous environments . More - over , NBD is environmentally sensitive , and its spectral proper - ties are dramatically different in aqueous and nonaqueous environments ( Johnson , 2005 ; Shepard et al . , 1998 ) . When NBD moves from an aqueous milieu ( e . g . , the surface of a soluble protein ) to a hydrophobic environment ( e . g . , the nonpolar interior of a membrane or protein ) , its emission intensity and ﬂuores - cence lifetime ( t ) increase , while its wavelength of maximum emission ( l em max ) shifts to the blue ( but not always , see the Supplemental Data ) . To distinguish the nonpolar membrane interior from a nonpolar environment inside a folded protein or at the nonpolar interface of associated proteins or domains , one can diagnostically identify the former by collisions between NBD probes and nitroxide collisional quenching moieties that are restricted to locations within the nonpolar core of the bilayer . Thus , bycontinuously monitoring in realtime thespectral proper - ties of an NBD - labeled protein ( emission intensity , ﬂuorescence lifetime , accessibility to quenchers , anisotropy , FRET ) before , during , and after it associates with other proteins or membranes , onecandirectlyquantifybothkineticandthermodynamicparam - eters of these interactions . In addition , since each protein contains NBD at only a single location , this approach provides an opportunity to characterize the structural changes that occur at speciﬁc sites in Vps20 and Snf7 . The different NBD - labeled and Rhodamine ( Rh ) - labeled mutants of Vps20 and Snf7 are denoted as Vps20 / Snf7 n - NBD / Rh , where n denotes the location of the cysteine residue modiﬁed with NBD or Rh . Vps20 Binding to Membranes ESCRT - III assembly is initiated by membrane binding of Vps20 ( Teis et al . , 2008 ) . To detect Vps20 binding to a membrane surface , NBD probes were positioned at four different sites in 98 Cell 136 , 97 – 109 , January 9 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . monocysteine mutants of Vps20 : residue 7 in the unstructured N - terminal loop , 61 in the a 2 helix , and residues 170 and 190 on either side of the a 5 helix ( Figure 1F ) . The ﬂuorescence emission of each of these NBD - labeled Vps20 derivatives was then characterized before and after the addition of liposomes comprised of phosphatidylcholine , phosphatidylserine , and phosphatidylinositol at molar ratios of 80 : 15 : 5 ( hereafter termed PC / PS / PI ) . No change in emission was observed for probes located at position 7 upon exposure to PC / PS / PI ( Figure 1A ) . However , an (cid:2) 6 - fold increase in intensity and a 13 nm blue shift in the l em max was observed for the NBD probe at residue 61 after liposome addition ( Figure 1B ) . Such substantial changes show that the NBD dye at residue 61 moves from an aqueous to nonaqueous milieu upon addition of membranes , a conclusion veriﬁed by a large increase in its ﬂuorescence lifetime ( data not shown ) . When Vps20 61 - NBD was titrated with PC / PS / PI , the emission intensity increased and reached a plateau ( Figure 1C ) , thereby suggesting that all Vps20 had bound to the membrane . To test A B C D E F Figure 1 .

On the basis of the sequence similarities of the ESCRT - III proteins , Vps20 , Snf7 , and Vps2 are believed to share structural features withthesolvedcrystalstructureofhVps24 . Helices a 1 – 5 and the N and C termini of the protein are labeled . Residues that were mutated to cysteine for labeling with NBD are depicted in cyan and labeled accordingly . Helix a 6 and the a 5 - a 6 loop have been manually sketched . this conclusion by an independent technique , we incubated a sample of Vps20 61 - NBD with liposomes and then puriﬁed it by gel ﬁltration chromatog - raphy . Since essentially all of the NBD ﬂuorescence was found to coelute in the void volume with the liposomes ( detected by light scattering ) and very little eluted with free Vps20 assayed in the absence of liposomes ( Figure 1D ) , more than 95 % of the Vps20 61 - NBD was bound to liposomes after elution . Thus , the membrane - dependent spectral changes do indeed result from Vps20 binding to a membrane surface . Large increases in intensity were also observed when excess liposomes were added to Vps20 with an NBD probe at either residue 170 or 190 ( Figure 1E ) . When each of these derivatives was titrated with PC / PS / PI , the binding curves were similar to that of Figure 1C ( Figure S2 ; data not shown ) . Thus , the similar PC / PS / PI - dependent spectral changes of probes at residues 61 , 170 , and 190 suggest that the probes near a 2 and a 5 are exposed to the nonpolar bilayer . This conclusion was conﬁrmed directly when the intensity of each probe was reduced by colli - sions with quenchers restricted to the nonpolar membrane core ( Figures S3B – S3F ) ( Johnson , 2005 ) . Interestingly , although the spectral changes for the probe at residue 7 in the unstruc - tured Vps20 N - terminal domain are slight upon PC / PS / PI addi - tion , the ﬂuorescence lifetime of this probe is somewhat high ( < t > = (cid:2) 4 ns ; aqueous t = 1 – 2 ns , and nonpolar t = 7 – 9 ns for NBD - labeled protein ) and its l em max is somewhat low ( 538 nm ; Cell 136 , 97 – 109 , January 9 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 99 typical range = 520 – 546 nm for nonpolar to aqueous ) even in the absence of membranes , which indicates that this probe is in a relatively nonpolar environment when Vps20 is free in solution . Vps25 Binds to Membrane - Bound Vps20 When either Vps20 61 - NBD or Vps20 170 - NBD was titrated with Vps25 , a protein in the ESCRT - II complex that directly interacts with Vps20 , little change in NBD emission intensity was observed ( Figures 2A – 2C ) . These small spectral changes reveal that the probes located at positions 61 and 170 in Vps20 do not experi - ence signiﬁcant changes in environment upon exposure to free Vps25 in solution and / or that Vps20 and Vps25 associate only weakly in solution . Probes at residues 7 and 190 were also insen - sitive to Vps20 exposure to Vps25 ( Figure 2F ; Figure S4B ) . Simi - larly , when Vps20 170 - NBD was ﬁrst bound to liposomes and then titrated with Vps25 , the NBD ﬂuorescence signal was unchanged by Vps25 ( Figure S4A ; Figures 2E and 2F ) . However , when Vps25 was added to membrane - bound Vps20 61 - NBD , a large additional B A C D E F Figure 2 .

These data strongly suggest that Vps25 and Vps20 associate on a membrane , but not in solution . Furthermore , the spectroscopic insensi - tivity of both free and membrane - bound Vps20 170 - NBD to the presence of Vps25 suggests that a signiﬁcant conformational change alters the environment of a probe at residue 61 , but not at 170 , upon association with Vps25 on the membrane . When excess Vps25 was added to membrane - bound Vps20 190 - NBD , a small emission intensity decrease was observ - ed ( Figure S4C ) , in contrast to the large increase seen with Vps20 61 - NBD ( Figure 2D ) . In addition , little change was detected with the Vps20 7 - NBD derivative ( Figure 2F ) . Thus , the use of multiple ﬂuorescent probes reveals that the environments of Vps20 residues 61 , 170 , and 190 are altered upon membrane binding and that the environments of the probes at both residues 61 and 190 are changed when Vps25 binds to the membrane - bound Vps20 ( Figure 2F ) . It must be emphasized that the exper - iments described above were carried out with concentrations of PC / PS / PI at which all of the NBD - labeled Vps20 is membrane bound ( Figure 1C ) . Hence , the changes in NBD intensity upon Vps25 addition reﬂect changes in the local environment of NBD asa result of Vps25 - Vps20 interactions rather than changes in the amount of membrane - bound Vps20 . It must also be noted 100 Cell 136 , 97 – 109 , January 9 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . that the size of a spectral change does not necessarily correlate with the magnitude of the conformational change that altered dye environment . Thus , one cannot conclude that the membrane - and Vps25 - induced structural changes in Vps20 were smaller near residue 170 than residue 61 . However , the most important observation is that the binding of Vps25 to Vps20 changed its conformation at two sites that are well sepa - rated in the predicted Vps20 structure ( based on the hVps24 crystal structure ) ( Figure 1F ) . Furthermore , the simultaneous binding of both Vps25 and a membrane surface elicited a unique Vps20 conformation . Snf7 Binding to Membranes To characterize Snf7 binding to liposomes , nine monocysteine Snf7 mutants were prepared and examined as above with Vps20 . With the exception of Snf7 14 - NBD , addition of PC / PS / PI to a Snf7 derivative elicited a blue shift in its l em max and an increase in its t ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , collisional A B C D E F Figure 3 .

Protein was detected by NBD emission intensity and liposomes by light scattering ( cyan ) . quenching experiments ( Johnson , 2005 ) demonstrated that these spectral changes resulted from the exposure of the NBD probes ( except at residue 14 ) to thenonpolarcoreofthebilayer ( FigureS5 ) . However , as is evident by comparison of emission scans of Snf7 81 - NBD ( Figure 3A ) and Snf7 200 - NBD ( Figure 3B ) in the pres - ence and absence of PC / PS / PI , the magnitudes of the membrane - dependent intensity increases varied considerably ( Figure 3C ) . Hence , the environments of probes at different locations , even those that are as spatially close as K14 , K21 , and K35 in the a 1 helix , P191 and P200 in the a 5 - a 6 loop , and E81 and S93 in the a 2 helix , differ for free and / or membrane - bound Snf7 ( Figure 3D ) . To ensure that the binding of protein to liposomes was complete in each of these samples , we titrated PC / PS / PI into the Snf7 proteins and measured intensities only at liposome concentrations that gave maximal intensities ( Figure 3E ; Fig - ure S6 ; data not shown ) . Thus , the different F bound / F free ratios suggest that the membrane - dependent structural changes vary for different Snf7 domains and even for sites within the same domain . When examined with gel ﬁltration , Snf7 binding to liposomes was found to differ from that of Vps20 . Whereas more than 95 % of the Vps20 remained bound to the PC / PS / PI liposomes after the chromatography ( Figure 1D ) , less than 50 % of Snf7 81 - NBD ( Figure 3F ) and the other eight Snf7 derivatives ( data not shown ) remained bound to liposomes . This result was not due to partial inactivation of the Snf7 81 - NBD proteins because thesameproteinswerecompletely boundto thesameliposomes under different conditions ( see below ) . Instead , the reduced Snf7 binding to liposomes after gel ﬁltration indicates that the membrane association and dissociation rates are faster for Snf7 than for Vps20 , even though maximal ﬂuorescence - detected Cell 136 , 97 – 109 , January 9 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 101 binding was obtained at similar PC / PS / PI concentrations for equivalent concentrations of Snf7 and Vps20 . Vps20 Appears to Bind to One End of Snf7 When NBD - labeled Snf7 was titrated with Vps20 in solution , probes positioned at opposite ends of Snf7 ( Figure 3D ) re - sponded very differently . The emission intensity of an NBD at residue 200 was completely unaffected by the addition of Vps20 ( Figure S7A ) . In contrast , the intensity of the probe at residue 58 increased substantially ( Figure 4A ) , by Vps20 alloste - rically altering the local Snf7 conformation near residue 58 and / or by Vps20 binding and covering the surface of Snf7 near residue 58 . Thus , although one probe is spectroscopically insensitive to Vps20 binding to Snf7 , the dependence of the Snf7 58 - NBD spectral change on Vps20 concentration shows that Vps20 and Snf7 associate in solution ( Figure 4B ) . Such an association is not thought to occur between Vps20 and Snf7 in solution , but the spectral data show that such binding does occur at the A B D F C E Figure 4 .

Protein was detected by NBD emission intensity and liposomes by light scattering ( cyan ) . nonphysiological protein concentrations used in our experiments . Interestingly , the spectral data indicate that Vps20 binds similarly to both free and membrane - bound Snf7 . Vps20 addi - tion did not signiﬁcantly alter emission of both free ( Figure 4B ) and membrane - bound ( Figure 4C ) Snf7 200 - NBD , even though the probe at residue 200 was very sensitive to Snf7 binding to the membrane ( Figures3Band3C ) . Theprobe at residue 58 was also sensitive to Snf7 binding to the membrane ( Figure 3C ) , but its environment was further altered by the binding of Vps20 to membrane - bound Snf7 ( Figures 4C and 4D ) . Given the similarities in the magnitudes of the Snf7 58 - NBD intensity changes and their dependence on Vps20 concentration ( Figures 4B and 4C ) , it appears that the extent of Vps20 binding tofreeandmembrane - boundSnf7issimilar . SinceVps20binding to Snf7 appears to be unaffected by whether or not Snf7 is bound to a liposome , it suggests that Snf7 interactions with Vps20 and membranes are uncoupled and noncooperative . However , a Vps20 effect on Snf7 binding to liposomes was revealed by gelﬁltration . WhenSnf7 81 - NBD wasincubatedwithbothliposomes and Vps20 and then chromatographed , essentially all ( > 95 % ) of the Snf7 was found bound to the liposomes ( Figure 4E ) . Thus , Vps20 markedly stabilizes Snf7 binding to membranes , as is clearlyevidentbycomparisonoftheelutionproﬁlesofSnf7inlipo - somal samples that either contain ( Figure 4E ) or lack ( Figure 3F ) Vps20 . These results demonstrate that Vps20 functions to stabi - lize Snf7 binding to the membrane , presumably by changing the Snf7 conformation and reducing its rate of dissociation from the membrane . As was true with Snf7 200 - NBD ( Figure 4B ) , titration of Snf7 35 - NBD with Vps20 had little effect on NBD emission intensity both in 102 Cell 136 , 97 – 109 , January 9 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . the presence and absence of PC / PS / PI ( Figures S7C and S7D ) . Hence , the probe at residue35 was notespecially sensitive to Vps20 binding to Snf7 . However , Vps20 - dependent emission intensity increases were detected for both free and membrane - bound Snf7 81 - NBD , though the spectral changes were small , especially for membrane - bound Snf7 81 - NBD ( Figures S7B – S7D ) . The probes between a 5 and a 6 ( residue 200 ) and near the middle of the a 1 helix ( residues 35 and 21 ; data not shown ) de - tected Snf7 binding to membranes , but not to Vps20 . In contrast , probes at residue 58 , at the other end of the protein ( according to the hVps24 crystal structure ) , and at residue 81 in a 2 were sensi - tive to Snf7 binding to both membranes and Vps20 . These data strongly suggest that the short Snf7 a 1 - a 2 loop and the a 2 helix are sensitive to Vps20 binding both in solution and on the membrane surface , while Vps20 binding has no detectable effect on the conformation or environment of the a 5 - a 6 loop or of a 1 for either free or membrane - bound Snf7 . Vps25 Does Not Detectably Bind to Snf7 Since Vps25 binding to Vps20 on the membrane alters Vps20 conformation ( Figures 2D – 2F ) , we also determined whether Vps25 binding to Snf7 could be detected spectroscopically . No Vps25 - dependent emission intensity changes were detected for both free and membrane - bound Snf7 58 - NBD ( Figure 4F ) . Simi - larly , no change in emission was detected when the NBD probe was placed at any of the other eight probe locations in Snf7 ( data not shown ) . Since Snf7 labeled at multiple sites did not detect - ably interact with Vps25 , it therefore appears that , as suggested by genetic studies , the protein - protein interactions that lead to the formation of the ESCRT assemblies occur in an obligatory sequence : Vps25 in ESCRT - II interacts with Vps20 on the membrane , and then Vps20 in turn promotes Snf7 binding to the membrane . Snf7 Oligomerization Requires Both Membranes and Vps20 The association of Snf7 into polymeric assemblies was detected directlythroughtheuseofavariationoftheﬂuorescenceresonance energy transfer ( FRET ) technique involving two samples of Snf7 E81C , one labeled with an NBD donor dye and the other with a Rh acceptor dye . When Snf7 81 - NBD and Snf7 81 - Rh were mixed in solutionatﬁnalconcentrationsof 320nMand4 . 2 m M , respectively , noFRETwasdetected ( TableS1 ) . Similarly , noFRETwasobserved with equimolar mixtures of Snf7 21 - NBD and Snf7 21 - Rh or of Snf7 21 - NBD and Snf7 81 - Rh ( Table S1 ) . Thus , no dimers or higher oligomers of Snf7 were detected in solution at this concentration . However , when liposomes were added to the sample , some FRET was observed between each of these pairs of labeled proteins ( Table S1 ) . Thus , upon binding to the liposomal surface , some donor - labeled Snf7 are positioned sufﬁciently close to acceptor - labeled Snf7 for FRET to be detected . But when Vps20 was added to these samples , a large increase in FRET was observed in each case ( Table S1 ) . The maximum FRET efﬁ - ciencies ( E ) differed for Snf7 pairs labeled at different sites ( Table S1 ) , as would be expected . These differences were not due to incomplete binding of Snf7 to the membrane because the Vps20 , Snf7 , and liposome concentrations used in the FRET experiments were in excess of that required to maximize Snf7 binding ( Figures 4D and 3E ) . It is therefore clear that Vps20 strongly promotes the oligomerization of Snf7 on the membrane surface and that both membranes and Vps20 are required for maximal association of Snf7 molecules . This conclusion is dramatically supported by the absence of FRET when the Vps20 PW mutant , a variant of Vps20 that is conformationally restricted at the C terminus ( see Snf7 PW results below ) , is added to the sample instead of wild - type Vps20 ( Table S1 ) . Proper determination of E in a membrane - containing sample always requires at least four samples . Emission spectra for donor - containing ( D ) , donor - and acceptor - containing ( DA ) , acceptor - containing ( A ) , and blank ( B ) samples containing Vps20 , liposomes , and Snf7 81 - C labeled with NBD , Rh , or nothing are shown in Figure 5A . E was quantiﬁed by comparison of the donor emission intensities at 530 nm in the normalized net D and DA spectra ( Figure 5B ) . In the absence of Vps20 , the donor emission intensity was nearly the same in the normalized net D and DA spectra ( Figure S8 ) . The much higher FRET efﬁciency observed in the presence of Vps20 ( Table S1 ) is probably due to Vps20 - dependent conformational changes in Snf7 that stabilize its binding to the membrane surface ( cf . Figure 4E ) and / orstabilizeitsbindingtoitselftoformmultimericassemblies . The requirements of Vps20 and membranes for inducing Snf7 oligomerization were also observed in a nonspectroscopic assay that detected Snf7 oligomerization in vitro via velocity sedimen - tation centrifugation on 10 % – 40 % glycerol gradients . The majority of Snf7 sediments in a low molecular weight fraction ( Mr < 156 kD ) upon incubation with soluble Vps20 or liposomes alone ( Figure 5C , i and ii ) . Consistent with the FRET data , we found that addition of Vps20 to a mixture of Snf7 and liposomes triggered Snf7 oligomerization that was exquisitely sensitive to the molar ratio of Vps20 to Snf7 . When equimolar Vps20 and Snf7 were mixed in the presence of liposomes , a small amount of Snf7 sedimented in the high molecular weight fractions ( Figure 5C , iii ) . Since the majority of Snf7 sedimented in the low molecular weight fraction under these conditions , equimolar Vps20 was inefﬁcient in nucleating Snf7 oligomerization , presumably because each Snf7 monomer was bound to Vps20 , and no Snf7 monomers are available for oligomerization . The Vps20 : Snf7 molar ratio in yeast cells is (cid:2) 1 : 10 ( Teis et al . , 2008 ) . When Vps20 and Snf7 were mixed at the physiological ratio in the presence of liposomes and sedimented , Snf7 was found in low molecular weight fractions containing monomeric Snf7and / orVps20 - boundSnf7 , andalsoinhighmolecularweight fractions ( (cid:2) 440 kD ) that contain Snf7 polymers ( Figure 5C , iv ) . Since a 1 : 10 molar ratio drove Snf7 oligomerization , a 1 : 20 Vps20 : Snf7 molar ratio was tested . Under these conditions , instead of two distinct species of membrane - bound Snf7 ( mono - mer and oligomer ) , Snf7 was smeared over the gradient in what appears to be a heterogeneous mixture of different - sized Snf7 polymers ( Figure 5C , vii ) . Thus , Vps20 nucleates Snf7 oligomeri - zation on membranes , but the size of the oligomers is dictated by the relative concentrations of Vps20 and Snf7 . The a 5 - a 6 Loop and Key Residues in and around a 4 Are Involved in Snf7 Oligomerization and Function To test whether displacement of the autoinhibitory loop ( a 5 - a 6 loop ) uponmembranebinding ( indicatedbycollisionalquenching Cell 136 , 97 – 109 , January 9 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 103 data ; Figure S5 ) is a prerequisite for Snf7 oligomerization , we generated the Snf7 PW mutant ( details in the Supplemental Data , S . iv ) . We predicted that bulky tryptophans introduced in the a 5 - a 6 loop would restrict conformational rearrangements of the loop and the movement of a 6 , thus making the Snf7 PW mutant defective in oligomerization . As expected , the Snf7 PW mutant did not oligomerize in vitro ( Figure 5C , xi ; Table S1 ) . Furthermore , an in vivo experiment performed with vps4 D snf7 D cells express - ing theSnf7 PW mutantrevealedthat themutantformofSnf7does not oligomerize on endosomes ( Figure 5E ) , whereas wild - type Snf7 expressed in the same cells oligomerizes into a 440 – 600 kDa complex ( Figure 5E ) . Also , snf7 D cells expressing the Snf7 PW mutant were defective in the vacuolar sorting of GFP - CPS ( Figure 5D ) . The combined results reveal that the a 5 - a 6 loop is required for Snf7 oligomerization , and this oligomerization is essential for the sorting function of Snf7 . We recently showed that soluble Vps24 forms ﬁlament - like structures in vitro and identiﬁed key residues in a 4 and the B A C D E Figure 5 .

( D ) In wild - type ( wt ) cells , GFP - tagged carboxy - peptidase - S ( GFP - CPS ) accumulates in the vacuolar lumen , whereas the FM4 - 64 dye stains the limiting membrane of the vacuole . In snf7 D cells expressing the different mutant forms of Snf7 or in vps20 D cells expressing the Vps20 PW mutant , GFP - CPS colocalizes either with the limiting membrane of the vacuole or the class E compartment . ( E ) Endosome ( P13 ) fractions prepared from vps4 D snf7 D cells expressing either wt Snf7 ( top panel ) or the different Snf7 mutants were deter - gent solubilized and analyzed with glycerol velocity gradients . a 3 - a 4loop thatmediatemonomer - mono - mer interactions ( Ghazi - Tabatabai et al . , 2008 ) . Snf7 contains identical or similar residues at these sites ( Figure S9 ) . The role of these key residues in Snf7 oligo - merization was examined by the genera - tion of two point mutants of Snf7 ( Snf7 L121D and Snf7 RE ; details in the Supplemental Data , S . iv ) . As with the Snf7 PW mutant , the two point mutants were impaired in oligomerization both in vitro ( Figure 5C , ix and x ) and in vivo ( Figure 5E ) and , conse - quently , in sorting GFP - CPS to the vacuolar lumen ( Figure 5D ) . Vps24 Limits Snf7 Oligomerization We recently showed that deletion of Vps24 results in unrestricted growth of the Snf7 polymer on endosomes in yeast cells ( Teis et al . , 2008 ) . To test directly whether Vps24 is sufﬁcient to limit the growth of Snf7 polymers assembled in vitro , Snf7 was mixed with liposomes , Vps20 , Vps24 , and sized with glycerol gradients . To ensure that Vps24 was not limiting , Snf7 and Vps24 were mixed at a nonphysiological equimolar ratio in the sample . Strik - ingly , the addition of Vps24 either by itself ( Figure 5C , v ) or in equimolar combination with Vps2 ( Snf7 : Vps24 : Vps2 molar ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 ) ( Figure 5C , vi ) resulted in almost complete disappear - ance of the (cid:2) 440 kD Snf7 oligomer . Vps24 therefore effectively blocks Snf7 oligomerization . Vps24 also blocked the formation of the heterogeneous mixture of Snf7 polymers assembled with a Vps20 : Snf7 molar ratio of 1 : 20 ( Figure 5C , viii ) . While the 104 Cell 136 , 97 – 109 , January 9 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . exact mechanism of Vps24 prevention of Snf7 oligomerization is not yet clear , it seems likely that Vps24 ‘‘caps’’ or prevents poly - merization by binding to Snf7 . The prevention of Snf7 oligomer - ization appears to be solely a function of Vps24 because in the absence of Vps24 , equimolar ( to Snf7 ) Vps2 did not block Snf7 oligomerization ( data not shown ) . Vps24 , Vps2 , and Vps4 Mediate Disassembly of Membrane - Bound Snf7 Oligomers To monitor disassembly of the membrane - bound Snf7 oligomer spectroscopically , we mixed six parallel reactions ( A – F ) contain - ing Snf7 81 - NBD mixed with Vps20 and monitored NBD emission . After 600 s , PC / PS / PI was added to each sample to initiate Vps20 - induced Snf7 oligomerization . The resulting intensity changes were equivalent for samples A – F and are shown by a single black trace in Figure 6A . At 1200 s , the samples received different combinations of puriﬁed proteins . After a 37 (cid:3) C , 45 min incubation , little to no change in NBD intensity was observed in samples lacking Vps24 ( A ) , Vps2 ( B ) , or a functional Vps4 ( C ) . In contrast , the NBD intensity increases were nearly reversed in a sample containing Vps24 , Vps2 , Vps4 , and ATP ( E ) , while a much smaller decrease in NBD emission was observed when ADP replaced ATP ( D ) . Similar results were obtained when samples were prepared with Snf7 21 - NBD , Snf7 35 - NBD , or Snf7 215 - NBD instead of Snf7 81 - NBD ( data not shown ) . To determine whether the large drop in NBD emission intensity reﬂects Vps4 - mediated release of NBD - labeled Snf7 from the membrane into the aqueous milieu , we analyzed samples by gel ﬁltration after the 37 (cid:3) C incubation . Nearly all of the NBD emis - sion in the complete sample ( E ) coeluted with liposome - free Snf7 ( red bar in Figure 6B ) , and very little coeluted in the void volume with the liposomes ( detected by light scattering ; blue bar in Figure 6B ) , thereby showing efﬁcient Snf7 release from the lipo - somes . In contrast , when the other samples ( A – D ) were analyzed by gel ﬁltration , nearly all of the NBD emission coeluted with liposomes in the void volume ( Figure 6B ; data not shown ) . Since membrane - bound Snf7 was not released into the aqueous milieu in samples lacking only Vps24 or Vps2 , the missing proteins were then added to A and B , respectively . After 45 min at 37 (cid:3) C , the lowered NBD intensity shows that Vps4 - mediated Snf7 disassembly now occurred in each sample ( Figure 6A ; the reduced intensity decrease compared to sample E presumably results from ATP hydrolysis during the second 37 (cid:3) C incubation ) . Thus , efﬁcient release / disassembly of membrane - bound Snf7 requires Vps24 , Vps2 , the ATPase activity of Vps4 , and ATP . Disassembly of liposome - bound Snf7 oligomers was also examined by glycerol gradient sizing assays . ESCRT - III complexes were assembled on liposomes in vitro by the combi - nation of Vps20 , Snf7 , Vps24 , and Vps2 at their previously deter - mined physiological molar ratio of 1 : 10 : 5 : 3 , and their (cid:2) 400 kD mass ( as judged by immunoblotting with Snf7 [ Figure 6C ] or Vps24 [ data not shown ] antibodies ) was very similar to the masses of ESCRT - III complexes that assemble on endosomes in vivo ( Teis et al . , 2008 ) ( no upstream ESCRT components were required for assembly presumably because of the high ESCRT - III protein concentrations used in the assay ) . The lipo - some fraction was isolated by centrifugation and split in two . One half was mixed with Vps4 and ATP , and the other half received equivalent amounts of Vps4 and ADP . After another 45 min at 37 (cid:3) C incubation , the liposomes were separated from soluble proteins by centrifugation , and both the pellet and super - natant fractions were further analyzed by glycerol gradient sizing . As shown in Figure 6C , the liposome - bound (cid:2) 400 kD ESCRT - III complex was disassembled by exposure to Vps4 and ATP . Most Snf7 was detected in the supernatant - derived fractions by immunoblotting with Snf7 antibodies ( 20 s expo - sure ) , whereas Snf7 could only be detected in the pellet - derived fractions after long exposure ( 12 hr ) . Thus , Vps4 - and ATP - medi - ated release of Snf7 from the liposomes into the supernatant was very efﬁcient . Interestingly , Vps4 appears to disassemble the membrane - bound Snf7 oligomers into monomers because Snf7 present in the supernatant was found in the low molecular weight fractions of the glycerol gradient ( Figure 6C ) . The ATP dependence of the disassembly reaction was shown by the inability of the ATPase inactivated Vps4 E233Q to disas - semble the membrane - bound Snf7 oligomer even in the pres - ence of ATP ( data not shown ) . Also , Vps4 - mediated disassembly of membrane - bound Snf7 oligomers was much less efﬁcient with ADP than with ATP since the majority of Snf7 was found in the pellet - derived fractions ( 20 s exposure ) ; only a small amount of Snf7 was found in the supernatant after a 12 hr exposure ( Fig - ure 6C ) . The size of the membrane - bound ESCRT - III complex was slightly smaller after than before treatment with Vps4 and ADP . We attribute this to one round of Vps4 - mediated disas - sembly that utilizes the ATP that may remain bound to Vps4 during puriﬁcation . Such an effect would also explain the small drop in NBD emission observed in sample D in our spectro - scopic Snf7 disassembly assay ( Figure 6A ) . Consistent with the spectral data , no Vps4 - and ATP - mediated disassembly of the membrane - bound Snf7 oligomer was observed in the absence of either Vps24 or Vps2 ( data not shown ) . ESCRT - III Assembly Induces Membrane Deformation To determine whether the assembly and disassembly of the Snf7 oligomerinducesmembrane deformation , weanalyzedliposome morphology at different stages of the ESCRT - III disassembly assay using negative stain electron microscopy ( EM ) . Untreated PC / PS / PI liposomes prepared by extrusion have a uniform , spherical appearance with a diameter of 80 – 100 nm ( Figure 6D ) . Upon exposure to the ESCRT - III complex ( Vps20 , Snf7 , Vps24 , Vps2 ) , a distinct change in morphology was observed for (cid:2) 90 % of the liposomes . ESCRT - III - bound liposomes had an inward invaginated appearance , and the size of the invagination was (cid:2) 40 nm in diameter . This deformation was observed only when liposomes were treated with all four ESCRT - III proteins : incubation with individual ESCRT - III proteins did not induce any detectable liposome deformation ( data not shown ) . Also , no lipo - somemorphologychangeswereobservedwhenmutantsofSnf7 that do not oligomerize ( Snf7 PW , Snf7 L121D , and Snf7 RE ) were mixed with Vps20 , Vps24 , and Vps2 ( data not shown ) . These data reveal that Snf7 oligomerization is critical for membrane invagination . Importantly , when ESCRT - III - bound liposomes were exposed to Vps4 and ATP , the near normal spherical morphology of the liposomes was restored ( Figure 6D ) .

ESCRT - III complex was assembled on liposomes with puriﬁed ESCRT - III proteins and centrifuged to separate the liposome - bound complex The liposome - bound ESCRT - III complex was treated with either ( 1 ) Vps4 and ATP or ( 2 ) Vps4 and ADP for 45 min at 37 (cid:3) C . After incubation , the samples were centrifuged to separate the liposome - bound proteins ( ‘‘pellet’’ ) from free ESCRT - III proteins ( ‘‘supernatant’’ ) and then further analyzed by velocity sedimentation . 106 Cell 136 , 97 – 109 , January 9 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . ESCRT - III - bound liposomes retained their invaginated appear - ance when treated with Vps4 and ADP . The reversibility of ESCRT - III - induced liposome deformation upon treatment with Vps4 and ATP , coupled with the other data presented above , demonstrates directly that liposome morphology is dictated by the assembly and disassembly of the ESCRT - III complex . DISCUSSION The ordered [ ESCRT - II ( Vps25 ) - Vps20 - Snf7 - Vps24 - Vps2 ] as - sembly and disassembly of the ESCRT - III complex has been re - constituted in vitro with puriﬁed proteins , ﬂuorescent - labeled derivatives of those proteins , liposomes comprised of PC / PS / PI , and multiple independent ﬂuorescence and other techniques . Speciﬁcally , our studies reveal that ( 1 ) Vps25 binds to Vps20 , but notto Snf7 ; ( 2 ) both Vps20 and Snf7 bind to a membrane surface ; ( 3 ) Vps25 binding to membrane - bound Vps20 alters its confor - mation ; ( 4 ) Vps20 binds the N - terminal end of membrane - bound Snf7 , and this association both stabilizes Snf7 binding to the membrane surface and alters its conformation ; ( 5 ) Vps20 nucle - ates Snf7 oligomerization on the membrane surface ; ( 6 ) Vps20 stabilizesand / orchangestheconformationoftheSnf7oligomers ; ( 7 ) Vps24 caps membrane - bound Snf7 oligomers ; ( 8 ) Snf7 oligo - merization is blocked by mutations just C - terminal of the a 5 helix and by mutation of critical residues in and around helix a 4 ; ( 9 ) membrane - bound ESCRT - III complex is disassembled by Vps4 inaprocessthatrequiresVps24 , Vps2 , andATP ; and ( 10 ) thelipo - some - bound ESCRT - III complex induces membrane deforma - tion , and Snf7 oligomerization is critical for this deformation . When considered in toto , these results suggest that the ESCRT - III functional cycle consists of an ordered multistep assembly involving three distinct stages ( ﬁlament / lattice nucleation , poly - merization , and capping ) ( Teis et al . , 2008 ) , followed by an ATP - dependent disassembly reaction . These complex , coupled , and regulated structural changes ultimately mediate membrane deformation , cargo sorting , and MVB vesicle formation ( Figure 7 ) . ESCRT - III Assembly Involves an Obligatory Sequence of Protein - Protein Interactions and Conformational Rearrangements The ﬂuorescence - detected conformational changes in the a 5 - a 6 loop strongly suggest that they are required to nucleate the ( D ) Negative stain EM analyses of PC / PS / PI liposomes , ESCRT - III bound liposomes , ESCRT - III - bound liposomes treated with 1 m M Vps4 + 1 mM ATP , and ESCRT - III - bound liposomes treated with 1 m M Vps4 + 1 mM ADP .

Cell 136 , 97 – 109 , January 9 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 107 assembly of the ESCRT - III complex . Such a conformational change was proposed earlier to mediate the association of ESCRT - III subunits by an intramolecular autoinhibition of ESCRT - III polymer formation ( Shim et al . , 2007 ) . The autoinhibi - tion model proposes that ESCRT - III subunits exist as metastable ‘‘closed’’ monomers in the cytosol because the C - terminal auto - inhibitory region of the molecule ( including a 5 and a 6 ) binds to a 2 of the core and thus prevents hetero - and homodimerization . Consistentwiththis , ourresultsindicatethatVps25hasnoafﬁnity for Vps20 in solution ( Figures 2A – 2C ; Figure S4B ) , there is no energy transfer between NBD - and Rh - labeled Snf7 molecules in solution ( Table S1 ) , and there is no oligomerization of Snf7 in solution ( Figure 5C , i ) . Implicit in the autoinhibition model is the idea that membrane binding and / or interactions with ESCRT - II generate the ‘‘open’’ state of the ESCRT - III subunit that is active forassemblyintotheESCRT - IIIlattice / ﬁlament . Thespectraldata presented here show that NBD probes incorporated within the a 5 - a 6 loop of both Vps20 and Snf7 exhibit a dramatic increase in NBD emission intensity upon membrane binding ( Figures 1E , 3B , and 3C ) , and—more importantly—that NBD emission from these sites can be efﬁciently quenched by membrane - restricted quenchers ( Figures S3C , S5B , and S3F ) . These data therefore directly show that membrane binding of an ESCRT - III subunit is accompaniedbythemovementofitsC - terminal a 5 - a 6loopadja - cent to the membrane surface . Rearrangement of the C - terminal endofbothVps20andSnf7uponmembranebindingmayexpose a 2 in each protein for homo - and heterodimerization interactions and thereby activate the ESCRT - III subunit ( ‘‘closed’’ to ‘‘open’’ statetransition ) forcontinuedassemblyintotheESCRT - IIIlattice . Consequently , mutations that block conformational ﬂexibility around the a 5 - a 6 loop impair Snf7 oligomerization and function ( Figure 5C , xi ; Figures 5D and 5E ; Table S1 ) . Spectroscopic characterization of Vps25 interactions with NBD - labeled Vps20 mutants revealed that the binding of Vps25 to Vps20 changed its conformation at both the N and Cterminus . Thus , althoughtheN - terminaldomainofVps20under - goes a larger spectral change and perhaps a larger conforma - tional change upon association with Vps25 ( Figures 2D – 2F ; Figures S4A and S4C ) , Vps25 binding clearly elicits a long - range conformational change in Vps20 that extends throughout its entire length ( see the Supplemental Data ) . Similarly , spectro - scopic examination of Snf7 mutants containing NBD probes at multiple locations and domains within the molecule allowed us to determine possible sites on Snf7 that bind to Vps20 . Our data indicate that the short Snf7 a 1 - a 2 loop and the a 2 helix are sensitive to Vps20 binding both in solution and on the membrane ( Figures 4A – 4D ; Figures S7B – S7D ) . In contrast , Vps20 binding had no detectable effect on the probe environ - ment and presumably conformation of the C - terminal a 5 - a 6 loop or of a 1 for either free or membrane - bound Snf7 ( Figures 4B and 4C ; Figures S7A , S7C , and S7D ) . These results strongly indicate that the heterodimerization interactions during the assembly of the ESCRT - III lattice are mediated by interactions involving the a 2 helix and the short a 1 - a 2 loop . As was true with Vps20 , Snf7 exhibited low afﬁnity for Vps25 in solution ( Figure 4F ) . However , in contrast to Vps20 , we also did not detect binding of Vps25 to any of the membrane - bound Snf7 monocysteine mutants ( Figure 4F ; data not shown ) . Specif - ically worth noting is the probe at residue 58 , which is sensitive to Snf7 binding both to membranes ( Figure 3C ) and to Vps20 ( Figure 4A – 4D ) but remains insensitive to Vps25 both in solution and when liposome bound ( Figure 4F ) . When combined , these dataindicatethatanobligatorysequenceofprotein - proteininter - actions mediates assembly of the ESCRT - III complex ( Figure 7 ) . How then does the system regulate interactions between the structurally similar ESCRT - III proteins that associate via a common surface ? The most likely explanation is that individual interactions elicit unique conformational changes and that the nextcomponent in the assembly pathway binds only to a speciﬁc ‘‘active / open’’ conformation . In this way , one can ensure that ESCRT - III assembly occurs in the proper order because a component can only associate with the precursor complex that has the necessary conformation . The spectral changes detected along the entire length of the Snf7 molecule upon membrane binding and interactions with Vps20 correlate with alterations in protein conformation that shift the functional / structural state of the protein from one state to another ( ‘‘closed’’ to ‘‘open’’ state transition ) and thereby activate it for assembly into the ESCRT - III lattice ( Figure 7 ) . Speciﬁc Function for Each Protein in the ESCRT - III Reaction Cycle The assembly of ESCRT - III on a membrane surface has striking mechanistic analogies to the assembly of ﬁlaments like actin or tubulin , where ESCRT - III appears to form a polarized ﬁlament that assembles in a sequential fashion with distinct nucleation and capping sites ( Figure 7 ) . Our results indicate that Vps20 plays a pivotal role in the assembly of a membrane - bound Snf7 polymer by stabilizing the binding of Snf7 derivatives to the membrane surface ( Figure 4E ) and by nucleating Snf7 oligomerization either bystabilizingthebindingofSnf7toitselftoformmultimericassem - blies and / or by altering the conformation of membrane - bound Snf7 to allow the assembly of an oligomer ( Figures 5A – 5E ; Figure S8 ; Table S1 ) . Interestingly , the ability of Vps20 to nucleate Snf7oligomerizationinvitro ( Figure5A – 5C ) andinvivo ( FigureS10 ) appears to be independent of its N - terminal myristoylation . Vps20 - inducedSnf7oligomerizationonthemembraneappears tobecriticalformembranedeformation , asjudgedbythefactthat Snf7 mutants that do not oligomerize ( in vitro and in vivo ) are defective in inducing changes in liposome morphology in vitro and in MVB sorting in vivo ( Figure 5C , ix – xi ; Figures 5D and 5E ; data not shown ) . How ESCRT - III induced liposome deformation in vitro relates to MVB formation in vivo remains an open question . However , the strong dependence of the observed lipo - some deformation on Snf7 oligomerization ( Figure 5C ; data not shown ) and the Vps4 - mediated reversibility of the deformation ( Figure 6D ) suggest a direct link between Snf7 oligomerization and membrane deformation . In addition to inducing membrane deformation , Snf7 oligomers could form rings , similar to the ring - like spiral ﬁlaments generated at the plasma membrane in mammalian cells overexpressing hSnf7 ( Hanson et al . , 2008 ) . A Snf7membrane - associatedring / spiralcouldencirclecargomole - cules and keep them committed to MVB sorting by conﬁning the integral membrane cargo proteins to a sorting domain from which they cannot escape ( Snf7 ﬁlaments tightly associate with the membrane surface ) ( Figure 7 ) . Recent work has shown that Snf7 108 Cell 136 , 97 – 109 , January 9 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . oligomers ( ﬁlaments ) associated with the endosomal membrane mayplayadirectroleincargosequestrationpossiblybyrestricting lateral movement of cargo molecules ( Teis et al . , 2008 ) . Our data suggest that Vps24 and Vps2 serve as adaptors for Vps4 - mediated disassembly of the Snf7 oligomer ( Figure 6A ) . The data presented here ( Figures 5C and 6 ) and results of in vivo studies ( Teis et al . , 2008 ; Obita et al . , 2007 ; Stuchell - Brereton et al . , 2007 ) are consistent with a model in which Vps24 terminates oligomerization , possibly by capping Snf7 oligomers and / or by recruiting Vps2 to the Snf7 oligomer in order to initiate Vps4 - mediated disassembly ( Figure 7 ) . The Vps24 - Vps2 ‘‘capping’’ complex may itself be in the form of a short mixed oligomer ( Lata et al . , 2008 ) , thereby providing multiple binding sites ( Vps2 MIM domain ) for Vps4 recruitment via the Vps4 MIT domain ( Obita et al . , 2007 ) . Although not addressed by the present study , we speculate that the Vps4 AAA - ATPase may drive the sequential release / disassembly of Snf7 molecules from one end of the Snf7 ﬁlament ring / spiral . This would result in closure of the Snf7 ring / spiral and concentration of cargo encircled by the ring ( Figure 7 ) . The Vps4 dodecamer could stabilize the ever - shrinking Snf7 ring via a combination of strong interactions with Vps2 and weak interactions with Snf7 mediated by the N - terminal MIT domain on each Vps4 subunit ( Obita et al . , 2007 ) . The closure of the Snf7 ring / spiral may also drive invagina - tion and ﬁssion of the sorting domain / vesicle , thereby directly coupling ESCRT - III disassembly to cargo sorting and vesicle formation ( purse string model ) . Clearly , this speculative hypoth - esis will require considerable new experimentation . However , it does offer a framework that could explain the mechanism by which ESCRT - III can sort cargo ( even after the Ub sorting signal has been cleaved ) , deform the membrane , and ultimately release the invaginated MVB vesicle into the lumen of the endosome . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Puriﬁcation and Labeling of ESCRT - III Proteins Recombinant Vps20 and Snf7 were expressed in C41 ( DE3 ) cells and puriﬁed withacombination ofNi 2 + - afﬁnity andionexchangechromatography . Puriﬁed proteins were labeled with NBD as described earlier ( Shepard et al . , 1998 ) . Details of the protein puriﬁcation and NBD - modiﬁcation procedures are presented in the Supplemental Data . Liposome Preparation Liposomescontaining100mol % 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - choline ( POPC ; Avanti ) or 80 mol % POPC , 15 mol % egg - phosphatidyl serine ( PS ) , and 5 mol % egg - phosphatidyl inositol ( PI ) were prepared by extrusion through a Liposofast extruder with 100 nm pore polycarbonate membranes as before ( Shepard et al . , 1998 ) . Fluorescence Spectroscopy All intensity and anisotropy measurements were carried out in 50 mM HEPES ( pH7 . 5 ) and100mMNaClat22 (cid:3) Cwiththesamesteady - state instrumentation and procedures described previously ( Shepard et al . , 1998 ) . Emission spectra for NBD - labeled proteins were recorded in 4 mm 3 4 mm quartz cuvettes coated with POPC to minimize adsorption . See the Supplemental Data for further details on ﬂuorescence spectroscopy , ﬂuorescence microscopy , and FRET experiments . Glycerol Velocity Gradients Endosome - enriched P13 fractions were prepared and solubilized with 0 . 5 % Tween - 20 and analyzed with a glycerol velocity gradient as before ( Teis et al . , 2008 ) .
