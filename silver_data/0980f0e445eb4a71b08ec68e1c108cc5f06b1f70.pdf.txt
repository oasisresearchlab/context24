A particular focus thereby was the concomitant excess mortality ( EM ) , i . e . fatalities above the expected all - cause mortality ( AM ) . Recent studies , inter alia by the WHO , estimated the SARS - CoV - 2 - related EM in Germany between 2020 and 2021 as high as 200 000 . In this study , we attempt to scrutinize these numbers by putting them into the context of German AM since the year 2000 . We propose two straightforward , age - cohort - dependent models to estimate German AM for the ‘ Corona pandemic ’ years , as well as the corresponding flu seasons , out of historic data . For Germany , we find overall negative EM of about − 18 500 persons for the year 2020 , and a minor positive EM of about 7000 for 2021 , unveiling that officially reported EM counts are an exaggeration . In 2022 , the EM count is about 41 200 . Further , based on NAA - test - positive related death counts , we are able to estimate how many Germans have died due to rather than with CoViD - 19 ; an analysis not provided by the appropriate authority , the RKI . Through 2020 and 2021 combined , our due estimate is at no more than 59 500 . Varying NAA test strategies heavily obscured SARS - CoV - 2 - related EM , particularly within the second year of the proclaimed pandemic . We compensated changes in test strategies by assuming that age - cohort - specific NAA - conditional mortality rates during the first pandemic year reflected SARS - CoV - 2 - characteristic constants . © 2023 The Authors .

Introduction A mortality rate is the number ( count ) of how many people have died in a specific country within a defined time interval , normalized to the whole number of inhabitants ( population size ) . Counts may also be done , for example , only within age cohorts , and the corresponding rates are then usually normalized to the cohort size . If counts do not ask for any death condition then all - cause mortality ( AM ) is registered . The balance of all - cause mortality rate ( AMR ) and birth rate determines whether there is overall growth or loss in the population . Across the world , the most usual and wide - spread way of documenting an all - cause mortality count ( AMC ) and an AMR by a state authority is to report them annually . Depending on the geographical , climatic and socio - economic situation , AMRs differ between countries [ 1 ] . In Europe and in the USA , for example , the annual AMRs are a little bit higher than one percent per year . Unsurprisingly , the AMRs in European and North American societies are mainly determined by the high probabilities of the eldest passing away [ 2 ] . The world - wide AMR has been generally decreasing during the last hundred years ( e . g . [ 3 – 6 ] ) . From the nineteenth century until now , the number of deaths due to infectious diseases were documented in more developed countries . Infectious diseases have a distinguishable impact on mortality . In Spain , from 1980 until 2011 as an example , mortality related to infectious diseases accounted for almost 15 % of the AM [ 7 ] , even though this percentage was decreasing during that period . As another example , data from cemeteries document a cholera epidemic in Brazil from 1855 to 1856 , which resulted in as much as 70 % more death counts in slaves than in free people , whereas the disease - specific mortality rate was identical [ 8 ] . Furthermore , people of different origin showed different mortality rates . The influenza pandemic between 1918 and 1921 significantly increased the mortality in European countries [ 9 ] as well as in Arizona [ 10 ] . During that period , increased mortality occurred within few weeks , and mainly people between 20 and 50 years of age were affected by this influenza pandemic . A socio - economic phenomenon could be identified in Estonia after the year 1989 , where the mortality in poorly educated subjects increased , while well - educated subjects had a constant mortality [ 11 ] . Taking the 2010 – 2011 Cholera epidemic in Haiti [ 12 ] as an example for the dynamics of infectious diseases , the AMR increased by about a factor of almost three over ten weeks ; after that , the AMR decreased to values lower than usual . The disease - related mortality rates differed regionally . In summary , a typical epidemic mortality pattern can be observed : initially , the mortality increases by a factor of up to ten within a few weeks ; after this period , there is usually mortality below average for several weeks . Accounting mortality over a whole year in extreme situations like the influenza pandemic one hundred years ago , the annual AMR can be as high as two - thirds [ 9 , 10 ] above the regular values ( an annual excess of 66 % ) . As a rule however , the all - cause and all - age mortality is dominated by specific disease sensitivities of some cohorts within the population , which may be old people or subjects with specific ( health ) conditions [ 2 , 10 ] . Moreover , socio - economic factors can have a strong longer - term impact on mortality rates [ 11 ] . When proclaiming a SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic in Europe in March 2020 , the leading politicians of almost all northern , central , western and southern European countries argued the same way , namely , that CoViD - 19 ( or ‘ C19 ’ ) would presumably kill more people than usual . In other words , a significant increase in mortality was to be expected . Even in late May 2021 [ 13 ] , German media and government officials in unison referred to weekly 1300 deaths related to C19 . This would have indeed been an excess mortality ( EM ) of 7 % in Germany , given that , in the calendar week 19 of 2021 ( 10 – 16 May ) , 18 534 ( with 95 % CI [ 16 811 ; 20 258 ] ) all - cause fatalities per week were the regularly expected AM background , according to our ( exponential ) model - based AM calculations in § 2 . 3 below in this paper . However , summing daily AMCs according to the data collected by Statistisches Bundesamt ( Destatis ; the German bureau for statistics ) [ 14 ] resulted in exactly 18 579 persons who had died in Germany in this very calendar week ( 19 ) just before the above - cited press conference . Thus , the ‘ awfully high number ’ of 1300 ‘ C19 deaths ’ , which were announced with great media impetus by both the German minister of health and the head of the Robert - Koch - Institut ( RKI ; the German centre for disease control ) , occurred in a week showing mortality perfectly matching expectations . In Germany , thus , simply and exactly nothing exceptional was going on epidemiology - wise , nothing of a deadly epidemic scenario played out at all . In any case , we had already wondered in the earliest ‘ pandemic ’ days , and nowadays even much more , where the vast majority of the media , in unison with authorities and their scientific consultants , took such large numbers from . More explicitly , we wondered why the German authorities refused to provide context to the public in order to assess the obtrusively r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o s R . S o c . O p e n S c i . 10 : 221551 2 proclaimed number of SARS - CoV - 2 - related ( C19 ) deaths . For the commonality , these numbers looked like ( significant ) EM . In March 2022 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) published an update of SARS - CoV - 2 - related ( ‘ associated with COVID - 19 ’ ) EM in Germany during the years 2020 and 2021 , with a 2 years total of 194 988 ( see [ 15 ] ) . They had calculated these numbers using a Bayesian sampling model with spline - based seasonal variation [ 16 , 17 ] . Therewith , the C19 deaths counted by German authorities had even been claimed to under - estimate the actual EM . Later , two WHO - endorsed model upgrades [ 15 , 18 ] provided a reduction to a 2 years total of 122 000 excess deaths , i . e . close to the German authorities ’ C19 death counts . The currently available WHO dataset [ 19 ] , however , now contains the excess number 101 505 [ 19 ] , which is even less than the RKI - claimed [ 20 ] 115 537 C19 deaths and does not appear in any of the aforementioned WHO - endorsed publications . With using only such data for analysis that have been published by German authorities themselves , we now aim in this study at providing estimates of both all - cause and SARS - CoV - 2 - related mortality , including excess numbers in both cases , for eventually providing a well - founded , sound and reliable final assessment of the epidemiological impact of C19 in Germany between 2020 and 2022 . Particularly , we provide hitherto missing context for SARS - CoV - 2 - related mortality numbers , both annually and flu - seasonally . In brief , we suggest to calculate , in each age cohort separately , a SARS - CoV - 2 - related excess count ( due to C19 ) by subtracting the cohort ’ s expected all - cause estimate from all the SARS - CoV - 2 - related ( with C19 ) fatalities counted therein . 2 . Methods 2 . 1 . Terminology and mathematical symbols We start our considerations with a synopsis of the terminology used , and some explanations that also include abbreviations as well as mathematical symbols introduced . A ‘ case ’ of SARS - CoV - 2 infection is indicated per legal definition , in Germany as commonly around the world , by a person being tested positively using a nucleic acid amplification ( NAA ) test [ 21 ] applied to sputum taken from the person ’ s throat or fluid from the nasopharynx . In Germany , to the best of our knowledge , an NAA test is mostly a laboratory - conducted PCR [ 22 ] , and only in rare cases a so - called ‘ point - of - care ’ ( PoC ) test . This is , although there are strong indications of a PCR test not being infection - indicative at all ( e . g . [ 23 ] ) , basically due to the fact that a NAA test checks for virus material in the mucous membrane rather than for indicators of responses by the immune system [ 24 – 26 ] . The German authorities , like most authorities around the world , yet relate a death to SARS - CoV - 2 if the deceased had received such a positive NAA test result and ( presumably , since criteria are not transparently communicated to the public , at least in Germany ) had shown some clinical symptoms of C19 before passing away . We use the term C19 death as an abbreviation of such a putatively SARS - CoV - 2 - related , NAA - test - conditional ( C19 ) death . In the following brief overview , we introduce all essential abbreviations , despite some doubling with the introduction : — AM for ‘ all - cause mortality ’ , i . e . deaths occurring due to any cause . — AMC for an ‘ AM count ’ , i . e . the sum of registered cases of deceased persons within a given time interval ( i . e . per time unit ) , whether a day , week , year , or season ; mathematical symbol for any AMC : D AM or , if referring to a particular cohort , D AM , coh . — AMR for ‘ AM rate ’ , i . e . the ratio of an AMC within a group ( e . g . age cohort or specific population ) to the sum of all group members ( e . g . cohort size N coh or number of inhabitants N pop ) ; mathematical symbol for any AMR : r AM : = D AM / N pop . If the AMR of a specific time interval ( e . g . flu season ; r AM , f ) is scaled to a full year AMR , it is marked with an asterisk ( e . g . r (cid:1) AM , f ) . — PF for ‘ positive - NAA - test - conditional fatality ’ , i . e . deaths occurring with the deceased persons having received a positive NAA test result some time before passing away ; in the following , ‘ positive - NAA - test - conditional ’ is further contracted to ‘ NAA - conditional ’ . — PFC for a ‘ PF count ’ , i . e . the sum of registered cases of NAA - conditionally deceased persons within a given time interval ; mathematical symbol for any PFC : D PF . — PFR for ‘ PF rate ’ , i . e . the ratio of a PFC within a group ( e . g . age cohort or specific population ) to the sum of all group members ( e . g . NAA pos ) ; mathematical symbol for any PFR : r PF : = D PF / NAA pos . — EM for ‘ excess mortality ’ , i . e . observed mortality ( whether all - cause or any conditional ) beyond expected mortality ( usually , like in this study , AM ) . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o s R . S o c . O p e n S c i . 10 : 221551 3 — EMC for ‘ EM count ’ , i . e . the difference between an observed mortality count ( in this study , AMC or PFC ) and the expected AMC . — SMR for ‘ standardized mortality ratio ’ , i . e . the ratio , within a group of persons fulfilling specific conditions ( e . g . NAA - positive or with a disease ) , of an observed mortality count ( in this study , PFC ) and the expected one ( usually , like in this study , AMC ) ; mathematical symbol for the SMR of NAA - positive persons : σ PF = D PF / D AM / PF , with D AM | PF being the number of all - cause deaths expected among the group members . — The mathematical symbol n tpp represents the number of NAA tests per person in a given time interval . 2 . 2 . Consulted datasets Here is a concise synopsis of the German data sources that we based the present analysis and model development on : — Earlier ( 2000 – 2015 ) all - cause daily and weekly death counts ( broken down by age cohorts ) were taken from the Destatis webpage at [ 27 ] . — Later ( 2016 – 2023 ) all - cause daily and weekly death counts ( broken down by age cohorts ) were taken from the Destatis webpage at [ 14 ] . — Weekly C19 death counts ( broken down by age cohorts ) were taken from the RKI webpage at [ 20 ] . — Counts of weekly SARS - CoV - 2 ‘ cases ’ ( i . e . numbers of positive NAA tests , broken down by age cohorts ; for person counts , we relate to § 2 . 5 and appendix A ) were taken from the RKI webpage at [ 28 ] . — The demographic ( age cohort ) distribution until 2020 ( based on the 2011 census ) and its presumable distribution onwards ( based on the most plausible scenario , the default model variant V1 ) were taken from the Destatis webpage at [ 29 ] . — Estimated counts of seasonal flu deaths were taken from the 2018 influenza report by the RKI [ 30 ] . To make all above datasets comparable , weekly time resolution was chosen as a default for both death counts and putative SARS - CoV - 2 ‘ cases ’ ( in fact , counts of NAA - positive persons ) , and thus for quantifying AMCs and PFCs ( i . e . counts per week ) . For allowing specific comparisons or statements , data were occasionally contracted to annual values , and to address and solve some subtle modelling issues , we sometimes went back to daily resolution , which is then pointed out explicitly . The age cohorts were categorized in eight groups in terms of the unit year : 0 – 29 , 30 – 39 , 40 – 49 , 50 – 59 , 60 – 69 , 70 – 79 , 80 – 89 , 90 + . This grouping constitutes the finest common resolution of the above datasets . Note that it makes a difference whether death counts are reported by Destatis on a weekly or daily basis . According to an ISO standard [ 31 ] , a German statistical year consists of either 52 weeks ( i . e . only 364 days taken into account ) or 53 weeks ( 371 days ) , as is well reflected by the daily death counts ( black spots in figures 4 and 5 ) differing from weekly ones ( orange squares in figures 4 and 5 ) . Accordingly , every 5 or 6 years , when a 371 - day years is inserted in the official statistical data presentation , the weekly counts show a leap artefact : when compared with a regular calendar year containing 365 days ( or 366 in a leap year ) , the missing 1 - day contributions ( presently in Germany : about 2800 fatalities ) of the preceding statistical 364 - day years are showing up due to summation over 7 days more than in the years before . 2 . 3 . Two models for calculating expected AMCs , and hence EMCs , for whole years and flu seasons When looking at the time courses of age - cohort - specific weekly AMR values r AM , coh = D AM , coh / N coh during the 20 years from 2000 until 2019 ( figure 1 ) , we see that they were all tendentiously decreasing , bar fluctuations in the observed data , from the early 2000s until around 2014 , from which on they seem to saturate to near constant values . In our present analysis , we restricted ourselves to estimate expected annual AMC values ( figure 2 a , 52 calendar weeks , i . e . 364 days ) as well as flu - seasonal ones ( figure 2 c , 33 calendar weeks from week 40 to next 20 [ 30 ] , i . e . 231 days ) . For all of these estimated annual ( figure 2 a ) and flu - seasonal ( figure 2 c ) AM data points , we give the 90 % confidence intervals ( CIs : ± 1 . 645 s . d . ) , which account for the fluctuations in the weekly observed data ( figure 1 ) . Here , we propose two plain AMC models for estimating expected ( regular ) AMC values in Germany , generally for an arbitrary time interval within a year . In fact , each expected - AMC model simply consists r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o s R . S o c .

In the first , simpler AMR model ( termed ‘ constant ’ ) , each cohort ’ s expected AMR value is a constant , the mean value over 6 years ( 2014 – 2019 , see below ) .

The function parameters are calculated by demanding this AMR function to best fit over the chosen period to the observed ( time ) course of AMR data points of which each is an arithmetic mean value across the selected interval within a year ( here , either the year itself or a flu season ) . The AMR functions can be used ( i ) to interpolate ( estimate ) potentially missing AMR data points within the fitting period , ( ii ) to estimate expected AMR ( and thus AMC ) values at any data point within the chosen fitting period or ( iii ) to extrapolate ( prognosticate ) expected AMR ( and thus AMC ) data points at times beyond 2019 , the latter two being the model applications within this study . Inthesimpler , ‘ constant ’ model , we take advantageofthe aforementionedsaturationoftheGermanAMR between 2014 and 2019 to calculate a mean annual AMR value for each cohort . We do so by fitting a constant function in a least - squares sense to the six data points , provided by the fit routine of the ‘ Curve Fitting Toolbox ’ in MatLab ( version R2022b ) . Further using the predint routine , we calculate a 90 % CI for the AMR in each age cohort . With this , we prognosticate the expected total German AMCs for the years 2020 – 2022 by calculating a weighted sum of the obtained ( time - constant ) AMR values ( and intervals ) , with each cohort ’ s size N coh taken from the observed ( time - dependent ) demographic distribution in the prognosis year . Note that the total CI radius is obtained by taking the square - root of the sum of the squared weighted - age - cohort - CI radii , according to the variance sum theorem . Accordingly , in the constant model for expected AM , the course of the total population ’ s AMC over both the fitting and prognosis time periods is solely due to shifts of the demographic distribution with time ( figure 3 ) . This method is comparable to the calculations provided by Destatis , where the weekly AMR medians of the four preceding years in each age cohort are weighted with the population in each cohort of the current year [ 33 ] . In the more elaborate , exponential model , we take all available ‘ pre - pandemic ’ years 2000 – 2019 , again conducting a fitting procedure , to determine best fitting parameters ( two for each cohort : a coh and b coh ) of the exponential AMR function ~ r AM , coh ð year Þ ¼ ð 1 (cid:3) b coh Þ (cid:4) exp ð(cid:3) a coh (cid:4) year Þ þ b coh ð 2 : 1 Þ to the year - resolved normalized AMR data points of each age cohort separately , ~ r AM , coh ¼ r AM , coh = r AM , coh , ref .

Note that we generally summed 52 weekly observed AMC values in one year to calculate the annual AMC values , which serve as the input for fitting the AMR function parameters . Thus , the parameters of our expected AMC models represent exactly 52 weeks , i . e . a 364 - day statistical year [ 31 ] . Therefore , any AMC model output is scaled by the factor 365364 to calculate an AMC estimation of a regular year , and by 366364 in a leap year . The same model calculations can be easily applied to estimate expected AMC values of any time interval within a year . Here , we restricted ourselves to estimate expected AMC values for only one further , specifically selected interval within a year , namely , the ‘ flu season ’ . Accordingly , the weekly ( or daily if available ) observed AMC values in a year have to be contracted by summation over only the interval of a flu season . We chose a fixed length of the latter by adopting its RKI definition [ 30 , p . 13 , 17 ] , namely , the interval from ( inclusive ) calendar week 40 in 1 year to ( likewise inclusive ) 20 in the subsequent one , and thus a flu season comprising 33 weeks , i . e . exactly 231 days . After contraction of the AMC values in each of the flu seasons 2000 / 2001 – 2019 / 2020 ( short form : 2000 / 01 – 2019 / 20 ) , the fitted exponential model parameter values ( i . e . those of the cohorts ’ AMR functions r AM , coh ( year ) from equation ( 2 . 1 ) ) , and thus the cohorts ’ expected AMC data points of interest , are specific for flu seasons . This method can be generally applied : a model for calculating , in a given population , expected AMC data points can be easily constructed for any specific time interval shorter than a year , not only a flu season . Within each cohort and at yearly resolution , just the cohort ’ s weekly ( or daily if available ) AMC values observed have to be summed over the chosen time interval . Subsequently , the fitting procedure provides parameter values ( for either the cohort ’ s exponential function or simply a constant , the mean of the interval sums taken into account ) that represent the ( smoothed ) course of the cohort ’ s expected AMC data points over the whole fitting period . 2 . 4 . PFR values from registered SARS - CoV - 2 ‘ cases ’ and C19 death counts : solving the problems of multiple tests per person and time delays While displaying PFR values in 2020 and 2021 , we noticed extremely low PFRs from late 2021 on , when compared with the first - year SARS - CoV - 2 infection period from May 2020 until summer 2021 ( see appendix A , table 7 for details ) . Our interpretation of these massively dropping PFR values is that , from some instant in late 2021 on , there has been an evidently inconsistent relation between official ‘ case ’ counts ( raw NAA pos , number of positive tests ) and the number of positively tested persons . However , to calculate a meaningful PFR , the number of persons having died ( D PF ) must be divided by the number of persons tested positive ( NAA pos processed to represent persons rather than positive tests ) . In other words : since late summer 2021 , the officially published ( raw ) NAA pos ( and thus PFR ) values cannot be reasonably interpreted as representing positively tested persons without additional processing . Fortunately , such processing , which implies a re - interpretation of what NAA pos counts mean , proved possible : we assume that the PFR values until summer 2021 are disease characteristics , which have been consistently determined due to a person - to - test ratio being nearly one - to - one in the first year of the ‘ Corona pandemic ’ , i . e . from May 2020 to May 2021 . With this , we re - calculated the raw NAA pos values for the subsequent , second year of the ‘ Corona pandemic ’ , i . e . May 2021 to May 2022 , and its sub - period , the flu season 2021 / 22 . We did so by multiplying the raw NAA pos , May21 / 22 values between May 2021 and May 2022 with the factor n tpp = r PF , May21to22 / r PF , May20to21 , and accordingly the raw NAA pos , flu21 / 22 values for the flu season 2021 / 22 with n tpp , flu = r PF , flu21 / 22 / r PF , flu20 / 21 . The results of this NAA pos post - processing are presented in § 3 . 3 . Another observation brought to light that reporting PFR values by dividing the number of C19 deaths per week ( D PF ) by NAA - positive ‘ cases ’ per the same week ( NAA pos ) is not recommended for two reasons . First , the number of NAA tests can well differ greatly by the week , so there is significant scatter along week - resolved time courses . Second , from receiving the positive test result ( or its date of registration ) to the actually corresponding death event , there is usually a time delay of several days or even weeks [ 34 ] . Here , we show that taking raw PFR values from an unprocessed calculation of a same - week ratio overestimates , on average , the PFR values that arise when comparing death counts to the number of positive test results from days ago . Therefore , our PFR analysis started with finding realistic delay values between the courses of NAA - positive ‘ case ’ counts and PFCs , one value for each age cohort . In doing so , we only relied on courses until the middle of 2021 , because later ( raw ) NAA - positive ‘ case ’ counts turned out to be unreliable ( see above ) . We determined these delay values in a r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o s R . S o c .

To this end , in each cohort , ( i ) a ( pseudo - ) daily resolution was generated by applying cubic - spline interpolation to the courses of both the PFC values D PF and the counts of NAA - positive ‘ cases ’ NAA pos , all known as weekly sums ; ( ii ) these two day - resolved courses were systematically shifted ( in discrete day steps ) relative to each other , and the arithmetic mean of the ( daily ) PFR values ( the ratio r PF = D PF / NAA pos of counts in a time unit ) was calculated for each day - shift value ; ( iii ) the very delay value with the minimal mean r PF value for a maximally five weeks delay was identified ( see figure 7 ; mean r PF values in table 7 ) . 2 . 5 . C19 death counts put into context : analysing PFR ( PFC ) against the background of AMR ( AMC ) As the final step within this study , we performed the analysis presented in § 2 . 3 again cohort - wise and both annually , with yet the years adapted to the ‘ Corona pandemic ’ ( i . e . across the calendar year boundaries : from May 2020 to May 2022 ) , and for the two flu seasons in this 2 - year episode . To put NAA - conditional mortality ( i . e . PFC and PFR ) into AM context , we applied the exponential model estimation of the age cohorts ’ AMRs ( § 2 . 3 , equation ( 2 . 1 ) ) , while also knowing the NAA - conditional cohort sizes ( for each , its NAA pos , coh value ) , to the group of Germans that have received a positive NAA test , i . e . the whole NAA - conditional sub - group of the population . Within each cohort , we contrasted the number D PF , coh of persons in the sub - sub - group therein , i . e . C19 fatalities , with the number D AM | PF , coh of persons who were estimated by our AMC model ( equation ( 2 . 1 ) ) to have expectably died due to any cause within the NAA - conditional sub - group of NAA pos , coh persons . That is , we calculated the NAA - conditional EMC by subtracting deaths D AM | PF , coh expected according to our AMC model from the number D PF , coh of official C19 deaths . NAA - conditional EMCs ( here , annual or flu - seasonal values ) quantify excess deaths in the sub - group of official C19 deaths , i . e . fatalities that are in excess of what is expected due to all causes . This method of determining a conditional EMC is generally applicable to any conditionally selected sub - group of a population . Within the sub - group of NAA - positive persons , we suggest to identify these definite excess deaths ( NAA - conditional EMCs ) with those having occurred due to C19 . The results of this analysis are presented in § 3 . 3 . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . The AMR course over 20 years : a Simpson ’ s paradox In this section , we will address the beneficial representation of AMR courses over time ( see § 2 . 3 ) and we show that the interplay of these courses with demographic changes results in a paradoxical phenomenon . Ignoring this interplay may result in devastatingly wrong forecasts of AMCs , as is discussed later . In order to achieve our main goal , the valid estimation of EMCs , we start here with scrutinising age - cohort - resolved AMR time courses during the 20 ‘ pre - pandemic ’ years , with the age cohorts being determined by the available datasets ( see § 2 . 2 ) . The first main finding of this investigation : the trend of the cohort ’ s AMR time courses may well be described by plain functions versus time ( § 2 . 3 ) . In Germany since 2000 , they turned out to be well of exponentially saturating character in all but one age cohort ( figure 1 ; more obvious when normalized to each its 2000 value : figure 2 b ) . The scientific value gained by identifying such basic functions for ( model - based ) AMC calculations lies in ( i ) their potential to reflect a trace of the dynamical mechanisms behind changing AM in a population and ( ii ) the transparency they lend to AMR and thus AMC estimations . The latter benefit comes in a big part from the inherent character of any continuous function in time , particularly if being of exponential character : to reflect physical and biological processes , rather than possibly arbitrary , mathematical black box assumptions . Due to time - wise continuity and moreover being low - parametric ( determined by only two parameters for each 20 data points ; see appendix B for their values and CIs ) , ( iii ) they also have inherently a smoothing , averaging character , which is a technical advantage for using such a function - ( model - ) based approach to estimate AMC base lines . The second main finding of this scrutiny : resolving AMC to age cohorts matters . A year - wise contraction of each age cohort ’ s weekly AMR time course ( figure 1 ) into a single data point , starting with the year 2000 , provided a sequence of annual AMR values ( coloured bullets in figure 2 a ) . Their general trend with time can be better seen by plotting each cohort ’ s AMR course of the annual values normalized ( figure 2 b ) to its reference value ( the value in 2000 or in the 2000 / 2001 flu season r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o s R . S o c . O p e n S c i . 10 : 221551 8 ( figure 2 d ) , respectively ) . Next , the course of the total German population ’ s AMR is calculated as the weighted sum over all cohorts ’ normalized AMR values in a given year , with each cohort being weighted by its relative proportion ( figure 3 ) in that year , times its respective reference value . If then both the year - resolved cohorts ’ normalized AMR courses and the course of the total AMR ( normalized to the sum of all cohorts ’ sizes : the whole population size ) are plotted over the 20 years 2000 – 2019 ( figure 2 b ) , a counterintuitive phenomenon appears in Germany : while each single cohort ’ s AMR tends to decrease over the years , in all age cohorts except the eldest whose AMR remains practically constant , the total AMR tends to increase , which applies consistently to both annual and flu - seasonal AMR courses . This phenomenon is known as Simpson ’ s paradox [ 35 – 38 ] . It is explained by summing over sub - groups ( cohorts ) that differ in relative proportion ( i . e . their weights , the time - dependent demographic distribution , figure 3 ) and effect strength ( i . e . the AMR values , which are strongly age - dependent ) : older people die at a higher probability per time ( e . g . a year , figure 2 a , or a flu season , figure 2 c ) , and , in Germany during the last about 10 years , the proportions of the 60 – 69 , 80 – 90 and 90 + year - old people increased , whereas those of all people younger than 60 years decreased ( figure 3 ) . Consequently , the ( average ) total probability of a German of whatever age to die within a year has increased , although each German below 90 years has gained more average life time during the twenty ‘ pre - pandemic ’ years until 2020 . Note first that the exponential fits ( according to equation ( 2 . 1 ) ) in the 90 + cohort did not yield a meaningful result ( no calculation of CIs was possible ) , neither for the annual values in 2000 – 2019 nor for the corresponding flu - seasonal values ; it was therefore substituted by simply fitting a constant for the 2000 – 2019 courses of each the annual and the flu - seasonal normalized AMR values ( figure 2 b , d ) . Note second , again , that only the data points between 2000 and 2019 ( or flu seasons 2000 / 01 – 2019 / 20 , respectively ) have been used to calculate the fit parameters ( separate for the years and the flu seasons ) . Thus , the line parts in figure 2 b and figure 2 d that pass the last three data points are extrapolations ( prognoses ) by the exponential fit functions ( equation ( 2 . 1 ) ) . The overall graphs are the graphical representations of the cohorts ’ expected AMR courses according to the exponential fit model , i . e . a smoothed ( when compared with the fluctuating values observed ) , model - based ( exponential fit ) reference for estimating EMCs . Not visualized here is the simplest reference model , the ‘ constant fit ’ , solely consisting of horizontal fit lines of which each runs through the arithmetic mean of one cohort ’ s AMR values observed in the last six intervals ( years or flu seasons ) before 2020 , i . e . a constant AMR value assigned to each cohort . Note third that , according to figure 1 , nothing else than ‘ AM as usual ’ occurred in Germany in 2020 and 2021 . Our assessment of entirely non - exceptional AMCs and all - cause EMCs in Germany during the SARS - CoV - 2 era ( 2020 and 2021 ) , be they assessed annually or during the flu seasons , is quantitatively substantiated in § 3 . 2 ( tables 1 and 2 in particular ) . Hence , it has to be assumed that any model calculation showing dramatic EMC in Germany during those 2 years fell for the Simpson ’ s paradox and has to be carefully reconsidered regarding the shifts in the demographic distribution , i . e . changes of the age cohorts ’ sizes with time ; see § 4 . 3 . 3 . 2 . Observed AMCs versus AMC - model - calculated fatalities : EMCs , annually and during flu seasons In this section , we show that both the constant and the exponential AMR models ( § 2 . 3 ) yield exceptionally good fits within the intervals 2014 – 2019 and 2000 – 2019 , respectively , as well as realistic prognoses for AMCs for 2020 – 2022 . Contrary to claims by the RKI of significant , and by the WHO even of drastic EM in Germany during the SARS - CoV - 2 era we even find negative EMCs ( under - mortality ) . In figure 4 , we have plotted actually observed data points ( counts on daily basis : black spots ) and the correspondingly expected exponential model estimates ( green triangles with CIs ) of the total annual AMC values since the year 2000 . The total - AMR - model - fit CI at any annual data point is calcuated as the weighted sum of the eight age - cohort - specific AMR model fits ’ 90 % CIs of that year . The annual sums of the daily observed AMCs ( the only data available by day ) are always within the CIs of the exponential model fit , except for the year 2019 in which significantly fewer than expected people died , and the year 2022 in which significantly more than expected people died . Accordingly , the exponential model generally well matches the observed AMCs over the whole analysed period from 2000 until today . For the flu - seasonal data in particular ( figure 5 ) , the AMCs expected from the r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o s R . S o c . O p e n S c i . 10 : 221551 9 simplest ( constant ) model ( blue triangles with CIs ) match the observed AMCs very well . All estimates by the constant model demonstrate impressively that , in Germany since 2014 , the total AMC time course is dominated for the most part by shifts in the demographic distribution with time ( figure 3 ) . The differences between both models ’ estimates , whether for whole years or flu seasons , are usually smaller than between an exponential model estimate and an observed AMC on a yearly basis . Note that the observed 2019 / 20 flu - seasonal AMC in Germany is well below both model estimates ( figure 5 ) , although this season contains the first SARS - CoV - 2 wave of infection ( start of the ‘ Corona pandemic ’ ) . For the total German population , we have listed in table 1 the exact numbers ( visualized in figure 4 ) of observed annual AMCs ( deaths ) since 2000 and their corresponding differences ( excess deaths : EMCs ) to both the exponential and constant model estimates . The observed AMCs are generally sums over 365 days , and 366 days in a leap year . The essential numbers are the EMC values in the last three rows of tables 1 , 2 , and , by our analysis , we can make a clear statement : fewer people than expected died in Table 1 .

In both ‘ Corona pandemic years ’ , non - existing EM gives evidence of there having been no exceptional public health situation whatsoever . In contrast to our finding , the WHO calculated a total EMC of about 195 000 during 2020 – 2021 : EMC is the difference between expected numbers , red stars with 95 % CIs in figure 4 , and actually observed numbers ( black dots ) . Note that the actual AMC data points for 2020 and 2021 are unfathomable 6 . 8 and 18 . 5 , respectively , standard deviations away from the WHO ’ s unvalidated point estimates from May 2022 . For the corrected prognosis [ 15 , 18 ] , these values are still 7 . 7 and 8 . 3 standard deviations away and for the latest dataset [ 19 ] 5 . 7 and 18 standard deviations . Further assessment of these models and their prognoses is given in § 4 . 3 and appendix C . In table 2 , the exact numbers ( visualized in figure 5 ) of observed AMCs ( deaths ) in Germany during the flu seasons — exactly 33 weeks , 13 at a year ’ s end plus the first twenty of the next : 91 plus 140 days , or 141 in a leap year — are reported . The exponential ( flu - seasonal AMR fit ) model output representing 33 weeks ( 231 days ) is scaled to a leap year by the factor 232231 , and , like in table 1 , the differences ( excess deaths : EMCs ) to both the exponential and constant model estimates are also given . Like in the data for the calendar years , the essential numbers are the excess values in the last three rows . In the flu season 2020 / 21 , an excess of 27 594 deaths can be attributed mainly to the second and third waves of putative SARS - CoV - 2 infections . The excess of 30 443 deaths was even a little bit higher in the following season 2021 / 22 . These excesses followed two seasons 2018 / 19 and 2019 / 20 with mortality Table 2 .

This is evidently a typical pattern for seasonal flu waves : sometimes up to four flu seasons of under - mortality in a row are followed by a similar sequence of stronger flu seasons with excess values on a level of 20 000 deaths . Since the last 10 years , the magnitudes of these fluctuations seem to slightly increase , with none of the flu seasons close to the expected value occurring in between anymore . Looking back to 2000 , the excess values in the two ‘ Corona seasons ’ have been just slightly higher than in the strongest influenza seasons of the 20 ‘ pre - pandemic ’ years ( 2002 / 03 , 2012 / 13 , 2014 / 15 ) . The two ‘ Corona seasons ’ were thus not at all on exceptional mortality levels . Our rating of flu seasonal EM is reconfirmed by published RKI numbers [ 30 , p . 47 ] : since season 2000 / 01 , they specified four excess estimates above 20 000 deaths , the highest ( 25 100 ) in the season 2017 / 18 , which may be seen as a calibration value for an EMC occurring in a significant ( moderately strong yet usual ) flu season in the last decade . Notably , we found a higher excess than the RKI in the season 2002 / 03 , and there are remarkable near - matches in 2008 / 09 , 2012 / 13 and 2014 / 15 ( referring to our exponential model at least ) . According to our analysis , the RKI excess values in 2016 / 17 and 2017 / 18 even seem to be slight exaggerations . 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 3 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 6 2 0 0 7 2 0 0 8 2 0 0 9 2 0 1 0 2 0 1 1 2 0 1 2 2 0 1 3 2 0 1 4 2 0 1 5 2 0 1 6 2 0 1 7 2 0 1 8 2 0 1 9 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 2 year 8 . 0 8 . 5 9 . 0 9 . 5 10 . 0 10 . 5 a nnu a l d ea t h s ×10 5 counted ( daily ) counted ( weekly ) model ( exponential AMR fit , years 2000 – 2019 ) model ( constant AMR fit , years 2014 – 2019 ) Destatis calculation method ( 2004 – 2022 ) WHO prognosis May 2022 WHO prognosis December 2022 WHO prognosis May 2023 Figure 4 .

But , on the other hand , one can see significant excess deaths during the flu seasons 2020 / 21 and 2021 / 22 . Correspondingly , there must have been significant under - mortality in the spring and summer periods in 2020 and 2021 , which compensated flu - seasonal excess within few months and can indeed be clearly observed in figure 4 in the age cohorts between 60 and 89 years . We come back to this phenomenon of compensatory under - mortality in the next section , which looks at NAA - conditional mortality . 3 . 3 . Putting NAA - conditional death counts into context : PFC against AMC background This section addresses the question ‘ Have people died with or due to SARS - CoV - 2 ? ’ . For this , we simply put NAA - conditional death counts ( PFCs ) into the context of regularly expected , all - cause death counts ( AMCs ) , i . e . present the results of calculating NAA - conditional EMCs ( according to § 2 . 5 ) . They are based on the processing of raw PFC data ( NAA pos as observed ) and corresponding PFR determination , as explained in § 2 . 4 . For each age cohort , we took its AMR values ( figure 2 ) , as well as its count of NAA - positive persons ( NAA pos processed ) and its number of fatalities proclaimed to be related to SARS - CoV - 2 ( D PF ) two weeks later , the latter two combined into PFR values ( r PF = D PF / NAA pos ; figure 8 and table 7 ) . As shown in appendix A , the ( raw ) number NAA pos of NAA - positive tests evidently has to be re - interpreted since the middle of 2021 when compared with the start of the RKI publishing these data since early 2020 : only until summer 2021 , tests and persons are practically congruent , afterwards , NAA pos must be processed to represent persons . All other data can be used as given above , the AMR values in particular , as they are only depending on plain , non - processed counts of all German citizens , and of all who died of any cause during the past : the plain registration of all deaths in files maintained by local authorities . Likewise , the NAA - conditional death counts D PF seem to be consistent ; in other words : the RKI criteria for proclaiming a death to be ‘ related to SARS - CoV - 2 ’ do not seem to have changed during the whole ‘ Corona pandemic ’ since early 2020 . Such consistency can be most notably concluded from the fact that , after having applied our processing ( see § 2 . 4 ) to the officially published NAA pos data since the middle of 2021 , the post - processed , inferred relative distribution of excess ( NAA - conditional minus all - cause ) death counts in 2021 / 2022 across age cohorts , given in tables 5 and 6 , are in very good proportion and accordance with those calculated without any NAA pos processing in 2020 / 2021 , given in tables 3 and 4 , respectively . The PFR values for May 2020 until May 2021 , practically identical to those in the corresponding flu season and taken as fixed disease characteristics , are presented in bold font in tables 3 and 4 . The result of the NAA pos processing can be seen in tables 5 and 6 in which we have crossed out the raw NAA pos numbers , put all values depending thereon in round brackets , and presented all processed results also in bold font . The ratios n tpp and n tpp , flu , which we would interpret as the number of multiple NAA tests per person within a year or flu season , respectively , are given in the last columns of tables 5 and 6 , respectively . The advantage of analysing the period of two whole - year intervals between May 2020 and May 2022 , respectively , instead of the two calendar years 2020 and 2021 as in § 3 . 2 , is that a May - to - May interval better distinguishes the ‘ Corona pandemic ’ situation ( its ‘ waves ’ ) . Moreover , the mortality outside a flu season can be easily seen from the differences between a whole May - to - May year , ending at calendar week 20 , and its entire ‘ flu season ’ included ( e . g . compare tables 3 and 4 ) . When looking at the ‘ Corona pandemic ’ , first - year period , May 2020 until May 2021 , we can see by comparing table 3 with table 4 that there were practically vanishing infection dynamics from late May 2020 until end of September 2020 , since all numbers in the whole - year period May 2020 – May 2021 only minutely differ from the corresponding flu season . The main result is found in the last columns of tables 3 and 4 . For each cohort , the calculated deaths in excess ( NAA - conditional EMC ) of what is expected according to AMR . These EMC values are what might eventually be related to SARS - CoV - 2 in an epidemiological sense . The total EMC value in the NAA - conditional sub - group in Germany from May 2020 until May 2021 was 37 427 , which contrasts to the RKI officially declared 81 433 ‘ C19 deaths ’ . Adapting the RKI nomenclature of deaths ‘ due to flu ’ ( ‘ Todesfälle durch Influenza ’ [ 30 , table 3 ] ; see also table 2 , last column ) to the context of SARS - CoV - 2 , this total EMC value of 37 427 can be seen as the number of persons who have died ‘ due to C19 ’ , whereas one might say that 81 442 persons have died ‘ with C19 ’ . Notably , the total NAA - conditional EMC was clearly higher in the corresponding flu season 2020 / 21 , namely , 52 747 deaths . This gives clear evidence that many of the persons who deceased in the flu season had only few months to live anyway , as an r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o s R . S o c . O p e n S c i . 10 : 221551 13 under - mortality must have occurred , even in the NAA - conditional sub - group of Germans , in both the summer periods 2020 and 2021 . Further , from May 2021 until May 2022 , the EMC value 23 348 was lower than the EMC from May 2020 until May 2021 ( 37 427 , table 5 ) and also lower than the EMC of the corresponding flu season 2021 / 22 ( 30 108 , table 6 ) . That the NAA - conditional sub - group is definitely not representative of the whole German population , and therefore only tells part of the total German infection dynamics in the ‘ Corona pandemic ’ first - year period , becomes evident from the total unconditional ( i . e . all - cause ) flu - seasonal EMC ( 27 594 with exponential model , or even just 14 526 with constant model ; see table 2 ) being clearly lower than the total flu - seasonal EMC in the NAA - conditional sub - group ( 52 747 ) . In the second ‘ Corona pandemic ’ flu season ( 2021 / 22 ) , however , NAA - conditional ( 30 108 ) and all - cause ( 31123 ) EMCs match well . As a side note of having the raw counts of positive NAA tests post - processed in the intervals May 2021 – May 2022 and flu season 2021 / 22 , we can eventually interpret the resulting , processed NAA pos values ( bold numbers in tables 5 and 6 , respectively ) once again as the numbers of positively tested persons ; the corresponding numbers n tpp and n tpp , flu have then gained the meaning of the average number of NAA tests per person and year or flu season , respectively ; their moderately cohort - dependent values are reported in the last columns of tables 5 and 6 . The annual n tpp values range from 3 . 33 to 6 . 14 , and n tpp , flu from 3 . 48 to 7 . 47 in the flu season . It seems that the test frequency has been raised most notably in the flu season 2021 / 22 , particularly in the youngest . We recapitulate : according to our model - based estimations , 37 427 Germans might be seen as having died due to C19 from May 2020 until May 2021 , encompassing the ‘ second and third Corona waves ’ . In the interval from May 2021 until May 2022 , another 23 348 Germans might be seen as having died due to C19 . The total annual NAA - conditional EMCs from May 2020 until May 2022 add up to exactly Table 3 .

As another side note , this differs by less than 1400 from the NAA - conditional EMC of 27 176 + 32 245 = 59 421 for the roughly five - months - earlier 2 - year period covering exactly 2020 and 2021 .

The latter numbers have been estimated from [ 40 ] and [ 41 ] , respectively . In [ 40 ] , they calculated an all - cause EMC of 8071 , with their mean of 2016 – 2019 AM baselines being lower than ours averaged over 2014 – 2019 ; furthermore , their number ( 8674 ) of ‘ C19 deaths ’ according to the RKI multiplied by 0 . 65 ( excess ( total ) / D PF in tables 4 and 6 ) is about 5650 ; official RKI data about a year later [ 41 ] deviated slightly : 9104 ‘ C19 deaths ’ , and thus an estimated number of 5920 excess ( due to C19 ) deaths . Another view on figure 1 supports these statements : the strong influenza seasons in 2002 / 03 , 2012 / 13 and 2014 / 15 show comparable patterns to the flu season 2020 / 21 ‘ Corona wave ’ . Further resolving tables 3 and 5 ( entire years ) into age groups reveals that NAA - conditional deaths are almost exclusively attributable to the age groups 60 + . Within the age group of 50 – 59 years , only 300 + 340 = 640 fatalities within two years may be ascribed to C19 , and for age groups below 50 , the negative annual excess numbers would be logged as ‘ overall zero deaths due to C19 ’ . In light of this , the 141 + 153 = 294 deaths ‘ due to C19 ’ during the two ‘ Corona pandemic ’ flu seasons ( tables 4 and 6 ) in the age group 40 – 49 can be interpreted as people who must have had pre - conditions to die anyway within the next half of a year . 4 . Discussion 4 . 1 . Using standardized mortality ratios to distinguish between deaths ‘ with ’ and ‘ due to ’ C19 We have presented and evaluated in § § 2 . 4 and 3 . 3 , respectively , a method to distinguish between concomitant ( with ) and causative ( due to ) C19 deaths . In brief , we calculated the expected AMC within the cohort of NAA - positive subjects ( D AM | PF ) , using our validated model ( see further discussion in § 4 . 3 ) , and subtracted this value from the number of observed deaths within this cohort ( D PF ) to obtain the excess value . These excess deaths can be assumed to have died ‘ due to ’ C19 , whereas subjects in D PF can only be labelled as having died ‘ with ’ C19 . Another way of representing the ratio of deaths ‘ due to ’ C19 ( excess / D PF ) is using the standardized mortality ratio ( SMR ; symbol σ PF ) as follows : s PF ¼ D PF D AM j PF ¼ D PF D PF (cid:3) excess ¼ 1 1 (cid:3) ð excess = D PF Þ ( ) excess D PF ¼ 1 1 (cid:3) s PF : ð 4 : 1 Þ In the following , we will compare our calculated SMR values , given in tables 3 – 6 , to the literature values . Von Stillfried et al . [ 41 ] conducted autopsies of Germans clinically suspected to have been struck by C19 and deceased after having received a positive NAA or antigen test ( within five weeks in about 90 % of the cases ) . They claimed that in 86 % of the autopsies conducted on 986 people , C19 was the underlying cause of death according to pathological evidence . However , according to [ 41 , fig . 1 ] , the authors had initially excluded autopsy results of 87 people with ‘ unspecific cause of death ’ written in their final autopsy report , and 22 persons with the report status ‘ cause of death pending ’ . Thus , basic population accounted for 1095 fatalities that either entered the autopsy procedures with a positive PCR or antigen test , or were at least tested positively post - mortem ( ‘… test … either pre - clinical , clinical or at post - mortem ’ [ 41 ] ) . Consequently , the 86 % ‘ C19 - is - the - underlying - cause ’ fraction has been in fact a 77 % fraction ( 0 : 77 ¼ 0 : 86 (cid:4) 9861095 ) . With almost 90 % of the dead examined in [ 41 ] having been of age 60 – 90 years , we can directly compare their actual fraction value 77 % to our estimated fraction of NAA - conditional excess deaths in the same age cohort during the flu season 2020 / 21 ( table 4 ) . We find excess = D PF ¼ 4506559434 ¼ 0 : 76 , i . e . a ( percentage ) fraction of 76 % ‘ deaths due to C19 ’ in these old cohorts , which is remarkably close to the 77 % provided by [ 41 ] . The corresponding SMR is s PF ¼ 1 1 (cid:3) 0 : 76 ¼ 4 : 17 according to our estimation ; 77 % would correspond to σ PF = 4 . 34 . During the whole - year interval May 2020 – May 2021 ( table 3 ) , when compared with ‘ wave ’ or flu - seasonal intervals , respectively , our estimated fraction in this 60 - to - 90 - years age cohort is lower , namely 61 % , which corresponds to s PF ¼ 1 1 (cid:3) 0 : 61 ¼ 2 : 56 . Generally , the σ PF values did practically not change for the succeeding ( 2021 / 22 ) flu - seasonal and whole - year intervals , respectively . The SMR or ‘ due - to - C19 ’ fraction , equivalently , can further be compared to the ‘ index of manifestation ( of C19 ) ’ μ C19 ( ‘ Manifestationsindex ’ [ 42 ] ) , which the RKI proposed to be the fraction of those actually showing symptoms of C19 among all those having received a positive NAA test ; the RKI gives a range ( across all age cohorts ) μ C19 = 0 . 55 … 0 . 85 [ 42 ] ; they had extracted these values from the literature until 29 November 2021 . More recent sources have provided the following values : 59 . 5 % [ 43 ] , 35 – 86 % [ 44 ] ( interquartile ranges ) and 56 % [ 45 ] . Now applying the logic that a person can only die of C19 if C19 symptoms have become manifest , these μ C19 values can be directly compared to the r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o s R .

Altogether , our calculations of the fraction or SMR , respectively , well match data from autopsies [ 41 ] , the RKI [ 42 ] and the literature , respectively . 4 . 2 . Synopsis of our estimates of all - cause and NAA - conditional EMCs in the light of otherwise reported values We suggest that our NAA - conditional EMC , which is calculated from RKI and Destatis data only , represents the very number of persons who have died due to C19 . For Germany , we estimate that 59 421 persons have died due to C19 during the two complete 2 - year period 2020 and 2021 . This total NAA - conditional EMC accounts for roughly 50 % of the 115 537 deaths officially counted by the RKI during this 2 - year period as related to C19 [ 20 ] ( 2020 : 44 238 ; 2021 : 71 299 ; 2022 : 48 499 ) . However , we found even a negative total all - cause EMC of − 11 479 ( resting solely upon Destatis data ; table 1 ) in those two years ; a minor EMC of 6992 in 2021 and moderate under - mortality of − 18 471 in 2020 . The year 2022 has brought an overall German all - cause EMC of 42 210 fatalities , which is the only annual signal significantly beyond the 90 % CI ( except from an under - mortality in 2019 ) . This finding is not discussed here , as the issue of all - cause EM revolved for age cohorts is going to be dealt with in a follow - up study . The correspondingly estimated all - cause EMCs for the flu seasons ( table 2 ) 2020 / 21 and 2021 / 22 have shown values of 27 594 and 31123 , respectively , which can be characterized as two typical , moderately severe flu seasons having occurred back to back . They followed however two essentially skipped flu seasons 2018 / 19 und 2019 / 20 , with EMCs of − 22 518 and − 22 041 , respectively . The comparison of annual with flu - seasonal AMCs implies that deaths occurring during these flu seasons were most likely to be due within the next months anyway . This view is strengthened by the observation of practically all of those deceased due to C19 being older than 60 years ( tables 3 – 6 ) , accepting that all - cause EMCs were dominated by NAA - conditional EMCs ( 52 738 and 30 099 , respectively ) , and the NAA - conditionally selected sub - group reflecting a sub - population of lower health on average . Further note that the all - cause EMC values ( tables 1 and 2 ) calculated by our simplest , constant AMC model are even less ‘ dramatic ’ than by the exponential one , when referring to the flu seasons in particular . As an additional model validation , the ‘ flu deaths ’ reported by the RKI between 2000 / 01 and 2017 / 18 ( last column in table 2 ) consistently match our seasons of calculated under - mortality ( RKI : zero flu deaths ) and the magnitudes within seasons of calculated all - cause EM . The high consistency of both our model estimates strengthens the evidence of exactly non - exceptional ‘ Corona pandemic ’ mortality in Germany . The high preliminary all - cause EMC of 49 563 within the season 2022 / 23 , which is likely to moderately increase due to delayed registration , will likewise be discussed within a follow - up , age - cohort - resolved study . Exceptionally deadly population dynamics in accordance with the WHO ’ s before - 2009 description of what should be classified as an ongoing pandemic ( in 2003 – 2009 comprising the qualifier ‘… resulting in epidemics world - wide with enormous numbers of deaths and illness ’ ) [ 46 – 48 ] are not discernible for the years 2020 and 2021 in figures 4 , 5 and tables 1 , 2 . Hence , data contradict a classification of C19 as an ‘ exceptionally severe disease ’ [ 49 ] or declaring its spread as a ‘ public health emergency of international concern ’ [ 50 ] . On 5 May 2022 , the WHO report announced a calculated mean of 66 794 ‘ C19 - associated ’ excess deaths for 2020 , and 128 194 for 2021 [ 19 ] , i . e . a sum of 194 988 EMC . Due to apparent ‘ data / model issues ’ [ 15 ] , these arguably pandemic - worthy numbers were subsequently lowered to 122 432 ( = 55 648 + 66 784 ) [ 15 , 18 ] . The currently available WHO dataset as of 19 May 2023 , however , contains a sum of merely 101 505 ( = 34 514 + 66 991 ) , without any publication reference . This last number even under - quotes the RKI count of 115 537 . We found another three articles reporting all - cause EMCs for Germany between 2020 and 2021 , which differed by a full order of magnitude ; first , a two - paper study from German and Swedish scientists [ 51 , 52 ] who proposed a total EMC of 6317 + 23 399 = 29 716 ; second , an article by German scientists [ 53 ] who used a similar method and proposed a total EMC of 4015 + 33 980 = 37 995 ; third , an article by the ‘ COVID - 19 Excess Mortality Collaborators ’ [ 54 ] , funded by the ‘ Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ’ , who claimed the highest EMC , namely , a mean 203 000 within a narrow range from 193 000 to 210 000 . Note that the latter source , although calculating all - cause EMC , denominate this value exclusively ‘ due to COVID - 19 ’ . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o s R .

Shortfalls and consequences for modelling reliable EMC At the end of the previous section , we have found that four mathematical models found four inherently different all - cause EMCs for Germany between 2020 and 2021 : from − 11 500 ( our study ) to 30 000 – 38 000 [ 51 – 53 ] to 122 000 [ 15 , 18 ] ( with them having reduced from initially 195 000 [ 19 ] published in the first WHO report ) to 203 000 [ 54 ] . In this section , we aim at resolving how these different estimates arose from a prima facie unambiguous dataset of a German AMC . Note that these EMCs are independent of any NAA - conditional counts and should thus not be equated or confused with deaths ‘ due to C19 ’ ( cf . § 3 . 3 ) , but thoroughly scrutinized . Three crucial model constituents are juxtaposed : ( 1 ) The data basis , including the range of years considered . ( 2 ) Model equations and ( over - ) parameterization . ( 3 ) Age cohort distribution and demographic changes . ( Ad 1 ) We compare the underlying datasets of all four models . As stated in § 2 . 2 , we used German AMC data of 2000 – 2019 ( exponential model ) and 2014 – 2019 ( constant model ) , respectively , as an input taken from Destatis [ 14 , 27 ] . The Wang et al . model [ 54 ] took the same Destatis data , but of 2016 – 2019 only [ 14 ] . De Nicola et al . [ 51 , 52 ] as well as Kuhbandner & Reitzner [ 53 ] likewise used Destatis data , but life tables ( annual AMRs instead of AMCs ) of 2017 – 2019 [ 55 ] . The WHO - endorsed models [ 15 , 18 ] relied on AMCs of 2015 – 2019 taken from the Human Mortality Database [ 56 ] . While the different datasets should in principle comprise the same ( or at least comparable ) AMC data , all models were based on different time intervals . A look at figure 5 suggests that this choice may well determine the reliability of model outputs . While 2014 was a year of rather low AM , 2015 was above the AM expectation compared to our exponential model , 2016 – 2018 showed a little below - average mortality , and 2019 was a year of significant under - mortality . Now , the fewer the years before 2020 considered in any kind of fitting , smoothing , or superposing , the higher the impact of the outlier 2019 , i . e . the trend to generally under - estimate AM - model - based expectations and thus report over - estimated EMCs . In the extreme case of choosing the interval 2015 – 2019 and taking weekly counts ( figure 4 ) , a mere linear fit of annual AMCs might well lead to even a slightly negative overall trend of prognosticated AMCs , if not considering the demographic changes ( see below ) . Tracing the effect on our constant model , we estimated in table 1 an under - mortality in 2020 and 2021 combined of − 4383 persons when using a six - years AMR average ( 2014 – 2019 ) . If we switched to 4 years ( 2016 – 2019 ) or 3 years ( 2017 – 2019 ) averaging , we would end up with EMCs of 11 976 or 15 268 , respectively . Using the 4 years median as suggested by Destatis [ 33 ] , we end up with a 2 years EMC of 22 354 ( = − 595 + 22 949 ) ; see table 1 . As can be seen in figure 4 , significant outliers such as 2019 have greater influence on the 4 years model than on our 6 years model . Also , constant AMR models work more reliably in regions of constant AMR and fail to prognosticate the situation in years with changing AMR ; see the Destatis - model - based estimates for 2004 – 2012 . This should be taken into account when using this method to estimate other pandemic key figures — such as the basic reproduction number [ 57 ] — based on EMC . ( Ad 2 ) We sketch the underlying models . The WHO - endorsed models [ 15 , 18 ] and the Wang et al . model [ 54 ] employed a Poisson sampling approach to calculate estimated AMCs for 2020 and 2021 on the basis of their respective datasets . Both approaches combined the observed AM fluctuations around the sampled mean with spline - based tends to take account of annual as well as seasonal AM changes . While the Wang et al . model [ 54 ] used linear splines for seasonal changes and cubic splines for yearly ( ‘ secular ’ ) trends , the WHO model in its initial form [ 16 ] used cubic splines for seasonal changes and thin - plate splines for yearly trends . Due to the German and Swedish excess estimates in [ 16 ] having initially been ‘ too high ’ [ 15 ] , the cubic - spline part was changed in the WHO - endorsed models [ 15 , 18 ] to thenceforth employ linear trends for yearly changes in Germany . What is more in the Wang et al . model [ 54 ] , the placement of the last knot for their splines was varied in order to yield four different extrapolations . With the implementation of another two sub - models , a Poisson regression model part and a ‘ last - year ’ ( 2019 ) model part , the Wang et al . model finally consists of a weighted mean of six sub - models . In the De Nicola et al . model [ 51 ] , life tables ( AMR ) are directly converted into expected AMCs , while using three differently detailed approaches ( see next paragraph ) . Thereby , the years 2017 – 2019 contributed equally to forming the prognosis for 2020 , for both yearly and weekly data , with only applying the most elaborated of the three approaches . The latter approach was also used in Kuhbandner & Reitzner r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o s R . S o c . O p e n S c i . 10 : 221551 18 [ 53 ] , with additionally distinguishing members of the population into males and females . For an immediate comparison , we recall our model approach to calculate an expected AMC : we estimate age - cohort - specific AMRs of 2020 and 2021 by extrapolating exponential fits to the AMR courses between 2000 and 2019 ( or , alternatively , constant fits between 2014 and 2019 ) , multiply these extrapolated AMRs by their corresponding proportions of the demographic distribution as prognosticated by Destatis [ 29 ] , and sum all so - weighted cohorts ’ AMCs . By looking at the required parameters , we find that the De Nicola et al . [ 51 , 52 ] as well as the Kuhbandner & Reitzner [ 53 ] model required no additional parameters , but rather assumptions on how life tables were to convert to future predictions of AMC . Our two model alternatives required either two ( exponential ) or one ( constant ) fit parameters per each of the eight age cohorts , together with each cohort ’ s AMR reference value in 2000 as a non - fit parameter . We emphasize that both formulations arose from a careful look at the normalized AMR courses over the twenty ‘ pre - pandemic ’ years ( figure 2 b ) and may not be applicable to the situation in other countries . Other plain , elementary , or special functions may yet be well suitable . For the WHO - endorsed models [ 15 , 18 ] or the Wang et al . model [ 54 ] , we find no definite number of required parameters . However , as cubic splines require at least four parameters more than there are control ( data ) points , plus parameters for the sampling , plus additional sub - models in the Wang et al . model , an investigation into their Akaike information criterion values would be required to avoid over - fitting [ 58 ] . While the Poisson sampling method has the general advantage of being flexibly applicable in cases of data transfer from countries being incomplete , the predictions for future developments have to be taken with extreme caution ( see appendix C ) . Wang et al . correctly state [ 54 , suppl . ] that cubic - spline extrapolation is subject to large uncertainties . This may have been the reason for the WHO - endorsed models eventually using linear regression instead of splines [ 15 , 18 ] . In any case , the low AMC observed in 2019 seems to have driven the severe under - estimation of 2020 and 2021 AMCs and hence severe over - estimations of EMC ( see the first model constituent above ) . ( Ad 3 ) Now turning to the third crucial model constituent , we showed in § 3 . 1 that age cohort distribution and demographic changes play a crucial role in the prediction of future AMCs . Evidently , a Simpson ’ s paradox yields an increasing average AMR since 2000 , while the trend is decreasing within each age cohort . Our AMC model as well as the De Nicola et al . and Kuhbandner & Reitzner models [ 51 , 53 ] included the demographic changes in Germany , the latter two additionally including age cohort transitions within years ( Lexis diagram ) . The WHO - endorsed models [ 15 , 18 ] do not include age cohort resolution , but provide a posteriori calculations of deaths within the age cohorts . The Wang et al . model [ 54 ] contains neither age cohort nor demographic considerations at all . Summarizing , our model produced the least deviations between modelled and measured AMCs , or , in other words , the least absolute EMCs . This had been achieved by ( i ) using a suitable long data history , ( ii ) assessing the Germany - specific time course of all age cohorts ’ AMRs , ( iii ) using a low - parametric and straightforward model and ( iv ) accounting for time - dependent age cohort distribution and thus demographic effects . In the past , the RKI had introduced similar model calculations [ 59 ] , also applied to estimate flu - seasonal EMCs [ 60 ] , and latest to the 2017 / 18 season [ 30 , pp . 13 , 17 ] ( table 2 ) ; but up to date any EMC estimation by the RKI during the ‘ Corona pandemic ’ period is owing . The urgent need for reliable , transparent and comprehensible estimates of all - cause EMCs on the basis of all - cause AMCs holds in particular , as all of the above WHO - associated publications [ 15 , 18 , 54 ] relate EMC to solely C19 . Furthermore , no distinction in deaths ‘ due to C19 ’ and ‘ with C19 ’ in the light of NAA - conditional mortality ( cf . § 3 . 3 ) has been made as of yet . The herein presented methodology may provide a blueprint for other countries and serve as a benchmark in Germany for both demands . 5 . Conclusion World - wide media coverage of the ‘ CoViD - 19 pandemic ’ is unsurpassed by any event recently ( or probably ever ) . Accordingly , a plethora of data have been collected and analysed to yield information and statistical knowledge about infection dynamics , as well as key performance indicators for their containment . The dramatic number of increased mortality was one of the most important arguments by politicians to impose strict socio - economical measures against the population . In this work , we aimed for scrutinizing the reportedly high EM during 2020 and 2021 . In stark contrast to the WHO estimates of 101 500 – 195 000 excess deaths in Germany in those 2 years , we even found a net under - mortality of − 11 500 , which implies that nothing but ‘ dying as usual ’ has happened , at least , when looking at the net proceedings across all age cohorts . Our analysis shows that the WHO estimates are r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o s R . S o c .

Further , all WHO - estimated excess deaths are attributed to solely C19 . Here , we have suggested a clear criterion to distinguish , at least on the epidemiological level , between deaths caused ‘ due to C19 ’ or only accompanied ‘ with C19 ’ . Based on a thorough analysis of NAA - conditional mortality , out of the about 115 000 ‘ C19 deaths ’ proclaimed by the RKI for 2020 and 2021 together , only about 59 000 or roughly 50 % may be considered causatively related to C19 . Several open questions arise from our analysis , requiring thorough subsequent investigation : do estimates of EM for other countries likewise suffer from ignoring demographic developments ? How could the exaggerated , non - validated EMC calculations under the auspices of the WHO become accepted [ 61 ] on a large scale ? Should not political measures undergo reassessment in light of realistic and reliable EM counts now being available ? Why have no calculations of the kind presented here been conducted by German authorities as of mid - 2023 , at least ? Data accessibility .

Appendix A . The course of the PFR during the SARS - CoV - 2 era : delay , tests and persons The results presented in this appendix are based on the calculations introduced in § 2 . 4 . In particular , we calculated a general time delay for all age cohorts from the time of tested infection to ( possible ) death . Figure 6 shows the time courses of the age cohorts ’ ( raw ) weekly PFR values ( D PF / NAA pos ) during the period of ( putatively only ) SARS - CoV - 2 infections , as calculated by dividing the number of C19 deaths D PF per week by the number of positive NAA tests NAA pos per the same week . Next , figure 7 shows the mean of PFR values ( D PF / NAA pos ) per age cohort when shifting the course of the registered death counts D PF by up to 5 weeks forward in time with respect to course of the registered counts of positive tests NAA pos . For each age cohort , we see that the PFR attains a minimum between 4 - and 24 - day shifts ( leaving away those younger than 20 years ) . For both simplicity as well as clarity reasons and because , on the one hand , almost all minima were very flat , and , on the other hand , another study [ 34 ] calculated a C19 - ‘ case ’ - death delay of 13 days in Germany for those older than 60 years , around which our values of all older than 50 years scatter ( figure 7 ) , we generally chose a two - week delay , which results in the weekly PFR values displayed in figure 8 . Two things strike to the eye in figure 8 . First , there were events of sudden PFR dipping by about an order of magnitude in early October 2020 in the two cohorts of those older than 80 years , each preceded by a peak in mid - September . This is presumably an artefact simply due to very low numbers of both fatalities and NAA - positive persons . Second , after a similar peak – dip event between the end of July and late August 2021 , the PFR values generally started to drop , first just slightly since October , and then the drop becoming particularly evident since the start of December 2021 . The effect of the PFR values in late 2021 , even more in 2022 , and in the flu season 2021 / 22 being so clearly lower than in 2020 and the season 2020 / 21 , respectively , becomes evident in table 7 in which arithmetic mean values ( annual and seasonal ) of the fluctuating time courses in figure 8 are given . Our suggestion to interpret such generally and significantly dropping PFR values is that there has been a near one - to - one relation between ‘ case ’ counts ( NAA pos ) and positively tested persons only until summer or maybe autumn 2021 . Afterwards , multiple NAA testings per person and year must have become a rule . We picked up on this issue in § 3 . 3 in which we used the interpretation of multiple testings to implement an additional NAA pos data treatment that infers processed PFR values for 2021 and 2021 / 22 , which prove absolutely reasonable . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o s R .

The AMR values of the flu seasons were scaled by 52 / 33 ( 33 weeks per flu season ) , symbolized by r AM , f (cid:1) , to make them comparable to both the annual AMR and the PFR values . Interesting observations in table 7 are summarized in the following : the first three items are about AM ; the subsequent ones compare AM ( r AM , r AM , f (cid:1) ) and NAA - conditional death rates ( r PF ) , that is , the likelihoods of a German citizen to die within a year ( or flu season scaled to a year , respectively ) due to any cause 03 / 2004 / 2005 / 2006 / 2007 / 2008 / 2009 / 2010 / 2011 / 2012 / 2001 / 2102 / 2103 / 2104 / 2105 / 2106 / 2107 / 2108 / 2109 / 2110 / 2111 / 2112 / 2101 / 2202 / 2203 / 2204 / 2205 / 2206 / 2207 / 2208 / 2209 / 2210 / 2211 / 2212 / 2201 / 2302 / 2303 / 2304 / 2305 / 23 time ( month ) 10 – 6 10 – 5 10 – 4 10 – 3 10 – 2 10 – 1 1 10 w ee k l y PF R ( w it hou t d e l a y ) 90 + 80 – 89 70 – 79 60 – 69 50 – 59 40 – 49 30 – 39 20 – 29 10 – 19 0 – 9 total Figure 6 .

Due to the reasons given in the preceding paragraph , PFR values of 2021 and the flu season 2021 / 22 are not addressed here . — All AMR values slightly increasing from 2019 to 2021 are fully consistent with the correspondingly increasing total EMC values evident from table 1 . The AMR values in 2020 and 2021 were higher than in 2019 for those with the highest AMR values ( 90 + and 80 – 89 cohorts ) , only slightly higher down to the age of 30 , and even minutely lower for the 0 – 29 cohort . — The AMR (cid:1) f values of the flu ( second and third Corona waves ) season 2020 / 21 are , in all cohorts 60 + , moderately higher than in the flu season 2019 / 2020 , slightly higher for the 30 – 59 cohort , and even minutely lower for the 0 – 29 cohort . The very same holds for the classification of the flu season 2020 / 21 AMR (cid:1) f when compared with the annual AMR values both in 2020 and in 2021 . This , most notably , owes to the fact that the flu season 2019 / 20 was exceptionally mild ( see again the total excess values in table 2 ) , with its AMR (cid:1) f values being in any cohort even lower than the annual AMR values in all 2019 – 2021 , except for the extraordinary low 2019 AMR in the 80 + cohorts : not only was the flu season 2019 / 20 very mild , but also the preceding year 2019 was obviously extraordinarily mild ( see again table 1 indicating a marked total under - mortality , negative EMC , in 2019 ) . — The 2021 / 22 AMR (cid:1) f values are practically the same as in the season 2020 / 21 , across all cohorts , which is again fully consistent with the respective EMC values being almost the same in these seasons , according to table 2 . — In 2020 , the PFR value of the oldest ( 90 + : 0 . 2945 ) is higher than all AMR and AMR (cid:1) f values in 2019 – 2021 and 2019 / 20 – 2021 / 2022 , respectively . Interestingly , the PFR value in the flu season 2020 / 21 was lower than in the year 2020 , and even lower than the respective AMR (cid:1) f values in both flu seasons 2020 / 21 and 2021 / 22 . — The PFR values of the three cohorts 60 – 89 were all between two and three and a half times higher than the respective AMR values in 2019 and 2020 , and AMR (cid:1) f values in the flu season 2020 / 21 , respectively . Again interestingly , like in the 90 + cohort , the PFR values of these three cohorts were lower in the flu season 2020 / 21 than in the year 2020 . — For the 50 – 59 cohort , the PFR values in 2020 and the flu season 2020 / 21 were just minutely higher than the respective AMR and AMR (cid:1) f values . For all younger cohorts , the PFR values in both intervals were clearly lower ( only a fourth among the youngest ) than all AMR values from 2019 to 2021 and the AMR (cid:1) f values of the flu seasons 2020 / 21 and 2021 / 22 . — The total ( weighted by cohort proportion ) PFR values in Germany were roughly double as high as total German AMR values , as they were dominated by the NAA - conditional death rate excess 05 / 2006 / 2007 / 2008 / 2009 / 2010 / 2011 / 2012 / 2001 / 2102 / 2103 / 2104 / 2105 / 2106 / 2107 / 2108 / 2109 / 2110 / 2111 / 2112 / 2101 / 2202 / 2203 / 2204 / 2205 / 2206 / 2207 / 2208 / 2209 / 2210 / 2211 / 2212 / 2201 / 2302 / 2303 / 2304 / 23 time ( month ) 10 – 6 10 – 5 10 – 4 10 – 3 10 – 2 10 – 1 1 10 w ee k l y PF R ( w it h 2 w ee k s d e l a y ) 90 + 80 – 89 70 – 79 60 – 69 50 – 59 40 – 49 30 – 39 20 – 29 10 – 19 0 – 9 total Figure 8 .

Optimal fit parameters See tables 8 and 9 . Appendix C . Numerical extrapolation of death counts This appendix aims to offer an explanation on how the different WHO - endorsed estimates of annual death counts in 2020 and 2021 [ 15 , 18 , 19 ] might have been achieved . It is important to note that the underlying generalized additive model ( GAM ) is a phenomenological one , i . e . does not incorporate structural knowledge about a population — such as size , age distribution or age - related mortality rates — but is solely based on the weekly reported numbers of deaths between 2015 and 2019 . Condensing the model by ( i ) omitting the Poisson sampling , as well as ( ii ) the within - year variation , and ( iii ) relying on yearly instead of weekly reports , we want to estimate AMC in 2020 and 2021 . The model equation [ 18 , eqn 2 ] suggests that spline extrapolation was used initially , but that the resulting ‘ excess estimate was too high because of a combination of data / model issues ’ [ 15 ] , such that it had eventually been replaced with a linear regression . With the annual AMC of 2015 – 2019 as a basis , we extrapolate the AMC of 2020 ( counted : 985 600 ) and 2021 ( counted : 1 024 000 ) applying three methods . First , a cubic spline smoothing was conducted using the MatLab routine csaps , with a smoothing parameter of 1 , ensuring interpolation . That spline was then extrapolated using the routine fnxtr , with a smoothness condition of order 3 . This method ’ s result well matches the initial ( May 2022 ) WHO prognoses for 2020 ( extrapolation : 914 500 ; WHO : 919 200 ) and 2021 ( extrapolation : 888 600 ; WHO : 889 300 ) and would result in a total EMC of roughly 200 000 . Second , the natural continuation of the smoothing spline was calculated , i . e . the coefficients from the smoothing spline were used on the enlarged interval until 2021 . This method yields values close to the WHO estimate presented in [ 15 , 18 ] for both 2020 ( continuation : 924 200 ; WHO : 929 900 ) and 2021 ( continuation : 956 900 ; WHO : 963 000 ) , resulting in an EMC of roughly 120 000 . Third , the AMC data of 2015 – 2019 were approximated by a linear function using the routine polyfit with a polynomial of degree 1 . The values of this extrapolation are close to those comprised in the latest WHO dataset [ 19 ] again for both 2020 ( regression : 954 300 ; WHO : 951100 ) and 2021 ( regression : 961 600 ; WHO : 956 900 ) , thus yielding an EMC of around 100 000 . Figure 9 shows the results outlined above . Although all three alternatives constitute vast over - simplifications of the WHO - endorsed models , the congruence is remarkable . This toy example also demonstrates the pitfall of extrapolating a phenomenological GAM , which is formulated as an admonition in the underlying source [ 58 ] : ‘ extrapolation is still a fairly dangerous thing to do , and we had better not rely on it very far into the future ’ . Hence , the results of the extrapolation have to be validated — for example by testing the method for previous years — in order to ensure their meaningfulness and to avoid arbitrariness . To demonstrate the latter , an additional fourth extrapolation method , a linear regression that uses the years 2014 – 2019 as basis , is shown ; see also [ 62 ] . Here , the values for 2020 ( regression : 968 500 ) and 2021 ( regression : 981 800 ) would result in an EMC of only 59 300 , which cuts WHO - endorsed EMC prognoses in half or even thirds , respectively . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o s R .

Four possible ways to extrapolate the annual death counts in Germany between 2015 and 2019 . Firstly and secondly , using a smoothing spline ( black line ) , its extrapolation ( green dash - dotted line ) or its continuation ( black dashed line ) can be calculated . Thirdly , a linear regression ( blue line ) on the basis of 2015 – 2019 is conducted . These three methods well match the prognoses given by the WHO in December 2022 ( red circles ) , May 2022 ( red squares ) , and May 2023 ( red stars ) , respectively . Note that for 2021 , red circle and star overlay . Fourthly , for comparison , a linear regression ( grey dashed line ) on the basis of 2014 – 2019 is shown . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o s R . S o c .
