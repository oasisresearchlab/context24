IS AMERICAN SCIENCE IN DECLINE ? DECLINE ? Alexandra Killewald Alexandra Killewald Harvard University Workshop on Undergraduate Workshop on Undergraduate Chemistry Education National Academy of Sciences May 22 , 2013 Undisputed Leadership of Contemporary p p p y US Science • 40 % of total R & D spending • 38 % of patented new technology • 45 % of Nobel Prize winners in physics , chemistry , and physiology / medicine • 35 % , 49 % , and 63 % , respectively , of the world’s scientific publications , citations , and highly cited publicationspublications • 15 of the world’s top 20 universities The Alarmist View The Alarmist View • Rising Above the Gathering Storm : Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future ( NAS , 2007 ) “With t d ff t t b l t th f d ti f • “Without a renewed effort to bolster the foundations of our competitiveness , we can expect to lose our privileged position . ” p • Concerned with impending shortage of American scientists • One of the most significant reports for US science policy in recent history • Quickly led to more than two dozen Congressional bills aimed at strengthening American science Is There Evidence in Support of the pp Alarmist View ? Yes • Yes • Three main aspects : I i ti t i d d i d i i • Increasing time to independence in academic science • Unfavorable labor market outcomes for scientists • International competition especially from East Asia • International competition , especially from East Asia International Competition 1 : Scientific Output Average annual growth rate in S & E article output United States EU - 15 Japan East Asia - 4 United States EU - 15 Japan East Asia - 4 Biology 1988 - 1992 1 . 7 6 . 4 4 . 6 17 . 7 1992 - 2003 1 . 1 4 . 1 3 . 9 16 . 0 Chemistry 1988 - 1992 4 . 2 5 . 7 6 . 6 33 . 3 1992 - 2003 1 . 2 2 . 3 2 . 4 16 . 1 Physics 1988 - 1992 5 . 1 10 . 6 10 . 9 19 . 7 1992 2003 0 3 3 4 4 4 14 3 1992 - 2003 0 . 3 3 . 4 4 . 4 14 . 3 Mathematics 1988 - 1992 - 2 . 0 3 . 2 - 8 . 1 18 . 1 1992 2003 1 4 6 7 8 0 14 2 1992 - 2003 1 . 4 6 . 7 8 . 0 14 . 2 Source : National Science Foundation ( 2007 ) .

But yet But yet… • The American scientific labor force is growing as a share of the employed • The American public continues to express confidence in the leaders of the scientific community and to in the leaders of the scientific community and to endorse public funding for basic scientific research • “Scientist” continues to be regarded as a high - prestige Scientist continues to be regarded as a high prestige occupation • American schoolchildren’s scores on standardized tests in math and science are rising and more are completing advanced coursework N d li i th it f i tifi hi h d ti • No decline in the pursuit of scientific higher education Bachelor ' s degree and science major attainment Male Female Bachelor ' s degree and science major attainment 1972 1982 1992 1972 1982 1992 Bachelor ' s degree ( % ) 27 . 8 30 . 7 30 . 5 23 . 9 29 . 8 36 . 9 A t 25 % i th Among top 25 % in math achievement 54 . 5 61 . 2 64 . 3 53 . 5 70 . 4 75 . 9 Science major given Science major given bachelor ' s degree ( % ) 28 . 7 31 . 4 28 . 3 10 . 2 13 . 7 13 . 2 Among top 25 % in math achievement 36 . 9 41 . 5 38 . 8 15 . 7 20 . 9 19 . 3 Physical science 7 . 4 3 . 4 3 . 1 3 . 6 1 . 3 1 . 6 Life science 9 . 6 5 . 0 8 . 1 4 . 6 5 . 3 8 . 3 Source : National Center for Education Statistics : National Longitudinal Study of 1972 ( NLS - 72 ) , High School and Beyond ( HS & B ) , and National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 ( NELS ) . ConclusionConclusion • Is American science in decline ? • Our answer is a qualified no • Why do some claim that American science is y declining while others claim that American science is doing well ? • From an international perspective , America’s leadership in science is declining • From a temporal perspective America is mostly doing • From a temporal perspective , America is mostly doing better than before • However , the rise of global science is not , g necessarily at the expense of American science Transitions to scientific employment , p y , bachelor’s and master’s level P t f t d t t iti i t i tifi l t Percent of recent graduates transitioning to scientific employment NES NSRCG 1976 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 2003 2006 Bachelor’s degree 60 . 9 72 . 7 82 . 5 81 . 9 80 . 4 81 . 5 54 . 1 54 . 0 Male 63 . 9 76 . 9 86 . 0 85 . 6 83 . 9 84 . 5 62 . 7 64 . 4 F l 47 1 49 0 71 8 73 2 72 0 74 1 40 0 34 0 Female 47 . 1 49 . 0 71 . 8 73 . 2 72 . 0 74 . 1 40 . 0 34 . 0 Master’s degree 82 . 5 86 . 9 89 . 2 90 . 7 90 . 1 88 . 8 80 . 8 76 . 9 Male 83 . 5 83 . 7 90 . 1 92 . 3 91 . 6 91 . 3 85 . 1 81 . 0 Female 74 . 8 60 . 3 85 . 7 85 . 3 84 . 9 80 . 9 71 . 8 68 . 0 T iti t i tifi l t Transitions to scientific employment , doctoral level Percent science doctorate recipients with R & D or teaching as p g primary / secondary work activities 1976 1981 1986 1991 1996 2001 2006 Total 81 . 7 80 . 7 81 . 1 76 . 1 70 . 9 70 . 4 72 . 8 Biological 78 . 5 77 . 0 75 . 5 72 . 0 70 . 2 69 . 0 68 . 6 Phys & Math 86 1 84 3 84 5 78 7 74 2 74 0 79 0 Phys . & Math . 86 . 1 84 . 3 84 . 5 78 . 7 74 . 2 74 . 0 79 . 0 Engineering 80 . 4 81 . 0 83 . 6 77 . 1 69 . 0 68 . 8 71 . 1 Source : Hoffer et al ( 2007 ) Source : Hoffer et al .
