Coller , The Rockefeller University , New York , NY , and approved November 23 , 2004 ( received for review July 6 , 2004 ) Integrins regulate cellular behaviors through signaling pathways , including Rho GTPases and kinases . CD98 heterodimers , comprised of a heavy chain ( CD98hc , SLC3A2 ) and one of several light chains , interact with integrins through CD98hc . CD98hc overexpression leads to anchorage - independent cell growth and tumorigenesis in 3T3 ﬁbroblasts and activates certain integrin - regulated signaling pathways . To establish the biological function of CD98hc , we disrupted the gene and analyzed CD98hc - null cells . Here we report that CD98hc contributes to integrin - dependent cell spreading , cell migration , and protection from apoptosis . Furthermore , CD98hc is required for efﬁcient adhesion - induced activation of Akt and Rac GTPase , major contributors to the integrin - dependent signals in - volved in cell survival and cell migration . CD98 promotes amino acid transport through its light chains ; however , a CD98hc mutant that interacts with (cid:1) 1 integrins , but not CD98 light chains , restored integrin - dependent signaling and protection from apoptosis . (cid:1) 1 integrins are involved in the pathogenesis of certain cancers . CD98hc deletion markedly impaired the ability of embryonic stem cells to form teratocarcinomas in mice ; teratocarcinoma formation was reconstituted by reexpression of CD98hc or of the mutant that interacts exclusively with integrins . Thus , CD98hc is an integrin - associated protein that mediates integrin - dependent signals , which promote tumorigenesis . amino acid transport (cid:1) signal transduction (cid:1) cell adhesion (cid:1) apoptosis (cid:1) cancer T he (cid:1) 1 integrins regulate numerous cellular functions by signal - ing through a variety of biochemical pathways ( 1 , 2 ) . CD98 ( 4F2 antigen ) is expressed on a family of heterodimers composed of a common type II transmembrane heavy chain ( CD98hc , 4F2hc , SLC3A2 ) and one of several light chains ( 3 ) . CD98hc is highly expressed on proliferating lymphocytes and on other rapidly grow - ing cells ( 3 ) . Overexpression of CD98hc transforms NIH 3T3 cells ( 4 ) . Furthermore , previous studies suggested two distinct functions of CD98hc : ( i ) It can associate with and regulate the function of selected integrins ( 5 – 8 ) , and ( ii ) it can regulate the expression and distribution of the light chains to modulate amino acid transport function ( 3 ) . These two functions depend on distinct domains within CD98hc : the extracellular domain is required for its inter - action with light chains , and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are required for interaction with integrins ( 9 ) . Finally , overexpressionof theportionof CD98hc that interacts withintegrin (cid:1) 1A subunit leads to anchorage and serum - independent growth of CHO cells in vitro ( 10 ) . To definitively address the role of CD98hc in integrin function and tumorigenesis , we disrupted the CD98hc gene . Here we report that CD98hc - null cells are markedly defective in integrin - dependent cell spreading and cell migration . Further - more , these cells manifest increased sensitivity to anchorage dep - rivation - induced apoptosis ( anoikis ) ( 11 ) . A requirement for CD98hc in adhesion - induced activation of Akt and Rac GTPase accounted for the defects in cell survival ( 12 ) and cell migration ( 13 ) . Furthermore , a CD98hc mutant that interacts with (cid:1) 1 inte - grins , but not CD98 light chains , rescued integrin - dependent sig - naling and protection from apoptosis . Finally , embryonic stem ( ES ) cells null for CD98hc lost their tumorigenic potential in vivo . Formation of teratocarcinomas in mice was rescued by reexpression of CD98hc or of the mutant that interacts only with integrins . These data establish an important role for CD98hc in integrin - dependent signals that contribute to tumorigenesis . Methods Generation of CD98hc (cid:2) / (cid:2) ES Cells . A P1 mouse ES cell clone containing the CD98hc gene was isolated from a 129Sv (cid:2) J mouse library by PCR screening ( Genome Systems , St . Louis ) . The targeting vector , pKO 4F2 , consisted of a 1 . 6 - kb 5 (cid:1) homologous region , a 5 - kb 3 (cid:1) homologous region ( Fig . 6 A , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) , and in the region of exon 1 , encoding the transmembrane domain of CD98hc , was replaced with a neomycin selection cassette . The linearized target - ing construct was electroporated into R1 ES cells . G418 - and ganciclovir - resistant colonies were selected for 7 days and screened by Southern blotting . To create double knockout ES cells , clones carrying a single null allele were retargeted with a construct encoding puromycin resistance . Two homozygous CD98hc - deficient clones were obtained ( Fig . 6 B ) ; both lacked CD98hc protein as determined by flow cytometry with anti - CD98 ( clone H202 - 141 , Pharmingen ) ( Fig . 1 A ) . Cell Culture . ES cells were cultured in complete DMEM high glucose ( GIBCO (cid:2) Invitrogen ) , supplemented with 15 % FBS ( Hy - Clone ) (cid:2) 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 3 ( GIBCO / Invitrogen ) (cid:2) 0 . 1 mM non - essential amino acid ( GIBCO / Invitrogen ) (cid:2) 0 . 1 mM 2 - mercapto - ethanol ( GIBCO / Invitrogen ) (cid:2) 2 mM L - glutamine ( GIBCO / Invitrogen ) (cid:2) 500 units / ml mouse leukemia inhibitory factor ( LIF ) ( Chemicon ) . ES cells were maintained on irradiated mouse feeder cells . The reconstituted cells were generated by infecting CD98hc - deficient cells with pMSCV - hygromycin retrovirus ( Clontech ) en - coding human CD98hc or the CD98hc (cid:2) CD69 chimeras ( 9 ) . Viruses were generated in EcoPack 293 cells ( Clontech ) , and viral titers ranged from 0 . 9 to 1 . 7 (cid:2) 10 6 units (cid:2) ml . After hygromycin selection , CD98hc or chimera expression was confirmed by flow cytometry ( 9 ) . To produce embryoid bodies ( EB ) , ES cells ( 10 4 ) were cultured without LIF or feeder cells ; vimentin - positive fibroblasts were derived from outgrowths of these EB and were immortalized by using pBRSV ( ATCC ) encoding for the SV40 - large T antigen . Induction of Teratocarcinomas . A suspension of ES cells ( 1 . 5 (cid:2) 10 6 cells per site ) was injected s . c . into either syngeneic 129 (cid:2) Sv or athymicBALB (cid:2) cWEHInudemice . Themicewereexaminedevery 3 days , and the tumors were quantified by measurement with calipers . After 33 days , tumors were fixed in 10 % formaldehyde and paraffin - embedded , sectioned , and stained with hematoxylin and eosin . In addition , some tumors were stained for proliferating cell nuclear antigen by using clone PC10 ( Zymed ) and counterstained with the nuclear dye YOPRO - 1 ( Molecular Probes ) . To ensure similar expression levels in reconstitution experiments , each cell line was supplemented with CD98hc - null ES cells so that a similar number of expressing cells was injected with each clone .

ES cell lines were trypsinized , rinsed , and suspended in complete medium . After depletion of feeder cells , ES cells were counted , and 10 6 cells were kept in suspension at 37°C for either 90 or 180 min in 2 - ml complete medium . Then , cells were rapidly rinsed in PBS and stained for 5 min at 4°C with 50 (cid:2) g (cid:2) ml propidium iodide ( PI ) ( Roche Diagnostics ) . Dead cells were defined as PI - positive cells by flow cytometry . Each assay was performed in triplicate . Spreading Assay . Cell - spreading assays were performed as de - scribed in ref . 14 by using coverslips coated with fibronectin ( Fn ) or laminin - 1 ( Ln ) ( Sigma ) . Cells were fixed with 1 % formaldehyde , examined by phase contrast microscopy , or stained for F - actin with rhodamine - phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) , and spreading was quantified by cell area by using IMAGE PRO PLUS software ( Media Cybernetics , Silver Spring , MD ) . Signaling Assays . After overnight serum starvation , cells were detached and kept in suspension in serum - free DMEM containing 0 . 2 % BSA for 1 h . Cells were then plated on dishes coated with Fn . Rac assays were performed on both ES cells and immortalized fibroblasts by using binding to the p21 - activated kinase binding domain to quantify GTP - Rac , as described in ref . 15 . At the indicated time points , cells were chilled on ice , washed with ice - cold PBS , and lysed in Rac assay buffer [ 50 mM Tris (cid:1) HCl , pH 7 . 0 (cid:2) 0 . 5 % NonidetP - 40 (cid:2) 500mMNaCl (cid:2) 1mMMgCl 2 (cid:2) 1mMEGTA (cid:2) protease inhibitors ( Roche ) ] containing 20 (cid:2) g of recombinant GST - p21 - activated kinase binding domain . Lysates were clarified by centrif - ugation and then incubated with glutathione - agarose beads ( Am - ersham Pharmacia Biotech ) for 30 min at 4°C . Beads were washed with Rac assay buffer and eluted with SDS (cid:2) PAGE sample buffer . Bound Rac was analyzed by Western blotting by using anti - Rac antibody ( 23A8 , Upstate Biotechnology , Lake Placid , NY ) . To measure phospho - Akt , cells were lysed in 20 mM Tris (cid:1) HCl , pH 7 . 6 (cid:2) 250 mM NaCl (cid:2) 3 mM EGTA (cid:2) 5 mM EDTA supplemented with protease inhibitors ( Roche ) and protein phosphatase inhibi - tors ( Upstate Biotechnology ) . Western blotting was performed by using phospho - specific Ser - 473 Akt protein or total Akt antibodies ( Cell Signaling Technology , Beverly , MA ) according to the man - ufacturer’s instructions . To assess phosphorylation of p130 CAS and focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , cells were lysed in modified radio - immunoprecipitation assay buffer [ 50 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 (cid:2) 150 mM NaCl (cid:2) 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 (cid:2) 1 mM EGTA (cid:2) 1 % Triton X - 100 (cid:2) 1 % sodium deoxycholate (cid:2) 0 . 1 % SDS (cid:2) 10 % glycerol (cid:2) 1 mM sodium orthovana - date (cid:2) 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate (cid:2) 1 mM NaF (cid:2) protease inhibitor mixture ( Roche ) ] and immunoprecipitated with the anti - p130 CAS or anti - FAK . Tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed by immuno - blotting with anti - phosphotyrosine antibody ( PY20 ) or with anti - phospho FAK ( pY576 ) antibodies ( BioSource International , Cam - arillo , CA ) . Cell Migration Assay . Cell migration was assayed in a modified Boyden chamber system by using transwell membranes coated with Fn . Fibroblasts ( 6 (cid:2) 10 4 ) were added to the top chamber and , after a variable time at 37°C , filters were fixed , stained with crystal violet , and migrated cells in the lower chamber were enumerated . Flow Cytometry . For integrin profiles , anti - mouse (cid:3) 1 ( clone Ha 31 (cid:2) 8 ) , anti - mouse (cid:3) 2 ( clone HM (cid:3) 2 ) , anti - mouse (cid:3) 4 ( PS (cid:2) 2 ) , anti - mouse (cid:3) 5 ( clone HM (cid:3) 5 - 1 ) , anti - mouse (cid:3) 6 ( clone GoH3 ) , anti - mouse (cid:3) v ( clone RMV - 7 ) , anti - mouse (cid:1) 1 ( clone 9EG7 ) , and anti - mouse (cid:1) 3 ( clone 2C9 - G2 ) were purchased from Pharmingen and used at the recommended concentrations . Goat FITC - conjugated anti - rat IgG and goat FITC - conjugated anti - hamster IgG were obtained from BioSource International and were used as secondary antibodies for (cid:3) 4 , (cid:3) 6 , (cid:3) v , and (cid:1) 1 detection and (cid:3) 1 , (cid:3) 2 , (cid:3) 5 , and (cid:1) 3 detection , respectively . Fn 9 – 11 binding was assayed by two - color flow cytometry as described in ref . 16 . To obtain numer - ical estimates of integrin activation , we calculated an activation index , defined as 100 ( F o (cid:3) F r ) (cid:2) ( F o 9EG7 (cid:3) F r ) , where F o is the median fluorescence intensity ( MFI ) of B9 – 11 binding , F r is the MFI of B9 – 11 binding in the presence of EDTA , and F o 9EG7 is theMFIofB9 – 11bindinginthepresenceofactivatinganti - (cid:1) 1mAb 9EG7 . Adhesion Assay . Ninety six - well tissue culture plates were coated with Fn ( Sigma ) overnight at 4°C , then blocked with a 2 % heat - inactivated BSA ( Sigma ) . Cells ( 5 (cid:2) 10 4 ) were plated in each well and were allowed to adhere for 5 , 10 , 30 , 60 , or 120 min at 37°C . Nonadherent cells were washed off , adherent cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet , and the crystal violet was extracted with 10 % acetic acid and measured in a microplate reader ( Molecular Devices ) at 560 nm . Results and Discussion Because the loss of CD98hc leads to embryonic lethality ( 17 ) , we disrupted both alleles of CD98hc in ES cells ( Fig . 6 A and B ) to Fig . 1 . CD98hc is not required for integrin expression or activation . ( A ) Flow cytometry analysis of CD98hc - deﬁcient ES cells .

Two CD98hc - deficient clones were obtained that were null for CD98hc protein ( Fig . 1 A ) and had similar properties in the experiments to be described below . WT CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) and CD98hc - reconstituted null cells expressed similar quantities of integrins (cid:3) 5 , (cid:3) 6 , and (cid:1) 1 as judged by flow cytometry ( Fig . 1 B ) . None of the cells expressed detectable (cid:3) 1 , (cid:3) 2 , (cid:3) 4 , (cid:3) v , or (cid:1) 3 integrins . The absence of CD98hc had no effect on the ability of the cells to bind to the soluble cell - binding domain of Fn ( Fig . 1 C ) , a direct measure of the affinity ofintegrin (cid:3) 5 (cid:1) 1 ( 18 ) . Wealsomeasuredthestaticadhesionofthese cells to Fn and , as expected from the lack of effect on integrin repertoires and integrin affinity , the lack of CD98hc did not impair static adhesion ( Fig . 6 C ) . There was a similar time - dependent static adhesion by 60 min , 26 . 6 (cid:4) 0 . 56 % of WT cells , 29 (cid:4) 3 . 2 % of CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) , and 27 (cid:4) 4 . 7 % of reconstituted CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells were adherent ( Fig . 6 C Left ) . When we examined adhesion to varying coating concentrations of Fn ( Fig . 6 C Right ) , a similar dose – response curve was obtained for the three cell types . Thus , CD98hc is not required for integrin expression , integrin affinity , or integrin - mediated adhesion . The CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells showed a dramatic reduction in spreading on Fn ( FN ) ( Fig . 2 A and B ) and Ln ( Fig . 2 D ) , strongly suggesting a defect in integrin signaling . We quantified cell spreading by cell area measurements ( Fig . 2 B ) . One hundred eighty minutes after adhesion to Fn or Ln , the surface area of the CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells was 38 % and 18 % that of the WT cells , respectively . CD98hc recon - stitution resulted in more than doubling of the surface area . With different concentrations of Fn ( Fig . 2 C ) or Ln ( data not shown ) , CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells spread significantly less than WT cells at all coating concentrations tested ; the defect was complemented by reexpression of CD98hc . To exclude the possibility that this result was ES cell - specific , we derived primary fibroblasts and SV40 large T antigen - immortalized fibroblasts from the CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) ES cells . All of the fibroblastic cells ( WT , CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) , or reconstituted CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells ) expressed integrins (cid:3) 5 , (cid:3) 6 , and (cid:1) 1 at similar abundance , and WT and CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) fibroblasts adhered to and bound to Fn to the same extent ( data not shown ) . Similar to ES cells , these CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) fibroblasts exhibited impaired spreading that could be rescued by CD98hc reconstitution ( data not shown ) . Because cell spreading and cell migration use many of the same signaling pathways ( 13 ) , we examined integrin - dependent hapto - taxis . The CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) fibroblasts showed a 5 - fold reduction in migration relative to the WT or reconstituted cells ( Fig . 2 E ) . Thus , CD98hc is required for efficient integrin - dependent cell spreading and cell migration . Adhesion - dependent cell migration and spreading involves acti - vation of the small GTPase , Rac , and phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3 - kinase ) ( 13 ) . To ascertain whether CD98hc participates in biochemical signaling initiated by integrins , we assessed adhesion - induced activation of Rac and phosphorylation of a PI3 - kinase downstream target , Akt . There was a profound suppression in adhesion - dependent Akt phosphorylation and Rac activation in the CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells , and this defect was reversed by CD98hc recon - stitution ( Fig . 3 A and B ) . Furthermore , CD98hc was not required for Akt phosphorylation in general because growth factor - induced ( Fig . 3 B ) phosphorylationwasnotimpaired . Finally , aconstitutively active form of Rac ( RacV12 ) restored spreading in CD98hc - deficient cells ( Fig . 3 C ) , proving that the spreading defect was ascribable to the defect in Rac activation . To explore the mechanism by which CD98hc contributes to adhesion - induced signaling , we examined early steps in the path - ways leading from integrins to Rac and PI3 - kinase activation ( 13 , 19 ) . The phosphorylation of p130 CAS is the initiating step in assembly of the CAS (cid:2) Crk (cid:2) DOCK180 complex that mediates inte - grin - dependent Rac activation . The phosphorylation of FAK re - sults in activation of PI3 - kinase . Furthermore , phosphorylated FAK functions as a scaffold by bringing active Src family kinases into proximity with p130 CAS , thereby promoting p130 CAS phosphor - ylation . Adhesion - dependent p130 CAS and FAK phosphorylation ( Fig . 4 A and B ) were dramatically impaired in CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells . Thus , CD98hc functions at critical early steps in integrin signaling pathways that lead to activation of Rac and phosphorylation of Akt . Previous studies show that integrin - dependent survival signals dependonPI3 - kinase - inducedactivationofAkt ( 12 ) , thuswetested the susceptibility of the CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells to cell death after anoikis ( 11 ) . When ES cells were placed in suspension , the CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells exhibited increased cell death relative to WT or reconstituted null cells as assessed by PI uptake ( Fig . 4 C ) . After 90 min in suspension , 32 . 5 (cid:4) 2 . 4 % ( SEM , n (cid:5) 4 experiments ) of CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells were dead , in comparison with 22 . 8 (cid:4) 1 . 8 % of the WT and 21 . 5 (cid:4) 1 . 7 % of the reconstituted CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells . This difference was also pronounced at 180 min ( CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells (cid:5) 62 . 7 (cid:4) 3 % vs . WT cells (cid:5) 44 . 4 (cid:4) 1 . 6 % and reconstituted CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells (cid:5) 41 . 2 (cid:4) 3 % ) . Thus , CD98hc provides protection from anoikis and promotes efficient cell spreading and migration ; it also mediates integrin - dependent biochemical signals such as phosphorylation of Akt and activation of Rac .

One hundred eighty minutes after adhesion to 10 (cid:2) g (cid:2) ml Fn , the surface area of the CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) ES cells ( open bar ) was signiﬁcantly reduced as compared with either the WT ( graybar ) orthehumanCD98hc - reconstitutednull ( ﬁlledbar ) EScells .

Cell - spreading assays were performed as de - scribed in A and B by using coverslips coated with 4 (cid:2) g (cid:2) ml Ln . ( E ) Time course of ﬁbroblast migration on Fn . CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) , WT ( wt ) , or reconstituted null ﬁbroblasts ( 3 (cid:2) 10 4 ) were added to the top chamber of a Fn - coated transwell and allowed to migrate for indicated time points . After ﬁxation , cells were stained with crystal violet , and the total number of migrated cells ( bottom chamber ) was enumerated . Feral et al . PNAS (cid:1) January 11 , 2005 (cid:1) vol . 102 (cid:1) no . 2 (cid:1) 357 C E LL B I O L O G Y CD98hc is a type II transmembrane protein composed of a cytoplasmic , a transmembrane , and an extracellular domain . By constructing chimeras with CD98hc and another type II transmem - brane protein ( CD69 ) , we previously found that the intracellular domain of CD98hc , comprised of the transmembrane and cyto - plasmic domains , is necessary and sufficient for interactions with (cid:1) 1 integrins . In contrast , the CD98hc extracellular domain is required for light chain association and amino acid transport ( 9 ) . Thus , we asked whether CD98hc contributions to anchorage - dependent sur - vival signals could be ascribed to the domain that binds (cid:1) 1 integrins . We reconstituted CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) ES cells and CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) fibroblasts with retroviruses encoding the previously characterized ( 9 ) chime - ras ( Fig . 5 A ) ; each was well expressed as judged by flow cytometry ( data not shown ) . The C 98 T 98 E 69 chimera , which associates with integrins but not light chains , completely rescued the defect in Rac activation . In sharp contrast , neither the C 98 T 69 E 98 nor the C 69 T 98 E 98 chimeras , which do not associate with integrins , had any effect ( Fig . 5 B ) . These data show that the intracellular and trans - membrane domains of CD98hc are necessary and sufficient for reconstitution of adhesion - dependent Rac activation . Because this same domain is involved in the interaction of CD98hc with the integrins ( 9 ) , these results suggest that the interaction of CD98hc with integrins mediates its effects on integrin signaling . Because of the important role of Akt phosphorylation in integrin regulation of apoptosis ( 12 ) , we tested the role of the CD98hc – integrin interaction in protection from anoikis . The integrin - coupled C 98 T 98 E 69 - protected cells from anoikis to a similar extent as full - length CD98hc after 90 min in suspension ( cell death : CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) ES cells , 33 . 6 (cid:4) 1 . 86 % ; C 98 T 98 E 69 reconstituted cells , 26 . 7 (cid:4) 2 . 6 % ; WT reconstituted cells , 23 . 3 (cid:4) 1 . 6 % ) and after 180 min ( cell death : CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells , 58 . 5 (cid:4) 2 % ; C 98 T 98 E 69 reconsti - tuted cells , 38 . 7 (cid:4) 1 . 3 % ; WT reconstituted cells , 40 . 3 (cid:4) 1 . 7 % ) ( Fig . 5 C ) . These results show that the portion of CD98hc that interacts Fig . 3 . CD98hc is a major contributor to the integrin - dependent activation of Rac and PI3 - kinase .

(cid:1) 1 integrins play an important role in cell proliferation and in some cancers ( 20 , 21 ) , and we report here that CD98hc enhances (cid:1) 1 activation of signaling pathways such as FAK , Rac , and Akt . These signaling pathways lead to in vitro phenotypes such as cell spreading , and these pathways also contribute to tumorigenesis ( 22 ) . To test the requirement of CD98hc for tumorigenesis in vivo , we exploited the observation that ES cells form teratocarcinomas after s . c . injection in mice ( 23 ) .

Mice were injected with 1 . 5 (cid:2) 10 6 cells per site and analyzed for 26 days . Depicted is the quantiﬁcation of tumor volume ( mean values (cid:4) SEM ) . Tumor volumes of WT ( wt ) ( F ) , CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) ( E ) , and CD98 (cid:3) / (cid:3) ES cells reconstituted with either C 98 T 98 E 69 chimera ( ‚ ) or full length CD98hc ( Œ ) were determined at various time points by using the formula : ( width ) 2 (cid:2) length (cid:2) 0 . 52 . CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells transfected with full - length CD69 were indistinguishable from untransfected cells ( data not shown ) . ( E ) Immunohistochemical analysis of proliferation by staining for proliferative cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) . After 26 days of tumor formation , sections of teratocarcinoma were stained for PCNA and counterstained by using green ﬂuorescent nuclear dye YOPRO - 1 . Higher - power images revealed that PCNA staining was restricted to the nuclei . ( Scale bar , 300 (cid:2) m . ) Feral et al . PNAS (cid:1) January 11 , 2005 (cid:1) vol . 102 (cid:1) no . 2 (cid:1) 359 C E LL B I O L O G Y nude mice led to the formation of large tumors . In contrast , CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells either did not form tumors or formed very small tumors ( Fig . 5 D ) . For WT ES cells , 17 of 20 injections yielded tumors within 33 days . In contrast , only 7 of 28 ES cell injections led to small tumors . The few small CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) tumors that formed exhibited profound reduction in cell proliferation as judged by staining with proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( Fig . 5 E ) . However , the resulting CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) tumors were clearly teratocarcinomas because they contained structures derived from all three germ layers ( Fig . 7 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . In these tumors , we identified keratin whorls , neural tissue , cartilage , muscles , and secretory epithelia . Quantifi - cation of tumor volume ( Fig . 5 D ) revealed that there was a delay in appearance of CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) tumors ( appearance on day 18 vs . day 6 ) and a marked reduction in tumor volume at all time points . Reconstitution of the CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells with human CD98hc re - stored tumor growth ( Fig . 4 D ) and cell proliferation ( Fig . 5 E ) . These experiments were also performed on syngeneic mice , and we obtained similar results to those seen in athymic mice ( data not shown ) . The integrin binding ( C98T98E69 ) chimera also reconsti - tuted tumorigenesis and proliferation ( Fig . 5 D and E ) . Thus , the portion of CD98hc that binds (cid:1) 1 integrins and enhances integrin signaling promotes tumorigenesis and cell proliferation in vivo . The presence of tissues derived from all three germ layers in the few CD98hc (cid:3) / (cid:3) teratocarcinomas that formed suggested that sev - eral differentiated lineages can develop in the absence of CD98hc . To test this possibility directly , we examined the in vitro differen - tiation of these ES cells into EB . Although the null cells formed smaller EB , a variety of cell types , including beating cardiomyo - cytes , differentiated from the EB ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , keratinocyte differentiation was unimpaired in CD98 (cid:3) / (cid:3) ES cells , as judged by expression of keratin 14 ( S . Broad and F . Watt , personal communication ) . Likewise , in vitro megakaryocyte differ - entiation from these ES cells ( 24 ) occurred , as evaluated by both morphology and the presence of CD41 and CD42b ( K . Eto and S . Shattil , personal communication ) . Thus , absence of CD98hc is compatible with differentiation of multiple cellular lineages but leads to profound suppression of tumor development . The pathogenesis of cancer often includes tumor cell escape from anoikis , i . e . , they become anchorage - independent for survival ( 25 ) . CD98hc binds (cid:1) 1 integrins , and (cid:1) 1 integrins play an important role in the transformation of certain epithelial cells ( 20 , 21 ) . Regulation of the activity of Rac and RhoA , through (cid:1) 1 integrins , contributes to tumor cell motility and invasion of cancer cells ( 26 ) . Similarly , expression of (cid:1) 1 integrins in (cid:1) 1 - deficient cell lines stimulates cell scattering through Rho GTPases ( 27 ) . In addition , FAK and Akt signaling pathways are involved in tumor formation ( 22 ) . We now findthatCD98hcmediates (cid:1) 1integrin - mediatedactivationofFAK , Rac , and Akt . CD98 is highly expressed in many tumors and transformed cells ( 28 , 29 ) . Increased expression is irrespective of tissue of origin , possibly because the first intron of CD98hc gene contains a transcriptional enhancer element that is active in most malignant human cells ( 30 ) . Furthermore , forced expression of full - length CD98hc can transform mouse fibroblasts ( 4 , 31 ) . Our finding that the domain of CD98hc that binds to (cid:1) 1 integrins stimulates teratocarcinoma growth and mediates integrin signaling indicates that the (cid:1) 1 integrin – CD98hc complex contributes to cellular behaviors leading to tumorigenesis . The genetic instability of cancer cells leads to wide variation in their dependence on signaling pathways that control cell growth and survival ( 32 ) . Here we show that CD98hc contributes to cell growth and survival by regulating integrin signaling . Future studies with conditional CD98hc gene deletions will be required to test its role in the pathogenesis of specific cancers . We thank Joan Brugge for many stimulating discussions .
