Few studies have examined the relationship between creative imagination and designer experience . Thirty visual designers were invited to participate in this study , which examined the differences in the brain activities of Experi - enced Designers ( EDs ) and Novice Designers ( NDs ) engaged in initiating imagination stimulated by abstract images . The following results were obtained . ( i ) The prefrontal and bilat - eral frontotemporal brain regions were activated during the idea generation task for the novelty indicator . ( ii ) The right frontal and temporal regions were activated during the idea evaluation task for the novelty indicator . ( iii ) During the idea generation task for the productivity indicator , noticeable activations in the right - biased middle frontoparietal region was observed . ( iv ) During the idea evaluation task for the productivity indicator , noticeable activations in the prefron - tal and frontal regions were detected . Introduction Designers often engage in activities involving the visualiza - tion of ideas , a process which primarily relies on their imagi - nations . Highly imaginative designers can create new forms of meaning and conjure new realities [ 1 , 2 ] . This capacity , known as initiating imagination , is the capability to explore the unknown and productively initiate novel ideas [ 3 ] . Initiating imagination is evaluated using two indicators , namely novelty and productiv - ity . Novelty refers to an individual’s ability to create uncommon ideas and productivity refers to an individual’s ability to produc - tively generate ideas . In addition , Mayseless , et al . [ 4 ] indicated that the process of producing creative ideas can be divided into two phases : idea generation and idea evaluation . However , few studies have investigated the relationships between designer creativity and their brain activities , as well as the differences between idea generation and idea evaluation [ 5 ] . The various working styles of designers reflect their distinct experiences , which are a critical factor influencing design per - formance [ 6 ] and play a decisive role in design thinking as the central inspiration for creating any design object [ 7 ] . The top - ics of designer experience and EExperienced Designers ( EDs ) MedDocs Publishers 2 Journal of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences have been discussed extensively over the past 30 years . Prior experience enables designers to adopt a conjectural approach to their designs and frame design problems in terms of relevant solutions [ 8 ] . EDs are solution focused , and thus they can shift quickly between problem scoping and solution proposing [ 9 ] . This coevolution of problems and solutions for EDs is a situated process that depends on specific problem domains and envi - ronments [ 9 - 11 ] . EDs can store and access information in larger cognitive chunks and demonstrate more schema - driven analogising than can Novice Designers ( NDs ) [ 9 , 24 ] . EDs can concurrently enact numerous cognitive activities because their knowledge is well organised , which enables them to access and process informa - tion more efficiently than can novices [ 13 ] . Moreover , most ex - pert designers adhere to a few possible solutions that emerge through the gradual transformation of some core ideas and are eventually proven to be the most effective strategies [ 14 ] . The aforementioned studies have focused on the systematic investigation of designer experiences and practices . However , few studies have been conducted regarding the relationship between designer experience and creative thinking . This is par - ticularly notable as regards empirical research involving alter - native methodologies such as neuroscience , which has high potential for experimentally tracing the interrelations between design cognition and brain activity [ 5 , 11 ] . In one of the few studies connecting designer experience to neuroscience , Goldschmidt , [ 15 ] emphasised that when EDs focus and defocus attention to stimuli , the structure and activ - ity of their neural networks operate in conjunction with their sensitivity , expertise , and flexibility to enable creative idea gen - eration . Specifically , previous studies have identified that the medial temporal lobe stores memories and associations from prior experiences and the medial prefrontal lobe facilitates the flexible use of these memories . These two lobes converge on major integration nodes [ 16 ] . Prior research has identified that the Default Mode Network ( DMN ) is active when people are engaged in internally focused tasks such as retrieving an au - tobiographical memory , envisioning the future , or considering the perspectives of others [ 16 , 17 ] . In addition , robust evidence indicates that the alpha effect is observable during the genera - tion of creative ideas and subjective experiences of emerging insights [ 18 , 19 ] . Liang et al . [ 11 ] observed that the visual attention of expert designers takes the form of frontoparietal engagement to se - lect from competing visual stimuli . The left dorsal stream and right ventral stream appeared to be particularly active when the designers were engaged in visual attention tasks . In addition , during a visual association task , the alpha waves of the expert designers were activated in the central region where the Dor - solateral Prefrontal Cortex ( DLPFC ) , Anterior Cingulate Cortex ( ACC ) , and DMN are located , whereas the γ waves were activat - ed in the distributed DLPFC , Posterior Cingulate Cortex ( PCC ) , DMN , and V1 regions . Yao et al . [ 5 ] further revealed strong connectivity between prior memories and high - order cognitive processing during visual association . Expert designers are more competent in controlling their executive functions to process conflicting concepts , determining future actions in accordance with their goals , and maintaining a balance between aesthetics and rationality than are NDs . The most effective stimuli for enhancing design creativity are visual , particularly abstract representations , which are distinct from habits of viewing and transcend the sensory experiences accessible in everyday life . Thus , designers’ capacity to engage in the creative process relies on high - level visual literacy [ 15 , 20 ] . In the current study , to address the lack of scientific evidence regarding the relationship between professional experience and designer imagination , differences in the brain activities of EDs and NDs engaging in initiating imagination stimulated by abstract images were analysed . The specific research questions were as follows : ( i ) Which brain regions are particularly activated when EDs and NDs engage in tasks that involve initiating imagina - tion ? ( ii ) What are the differences in brain activities between EDs and NDs in terms of the two indicators of initiating imagina - tion ( i . e . , novelty and productivity ) ? ( iii ) What are the differences in brain activities between EDs and NDs in terms of two idea - processing tasks ( i . e . , idea generation and idea evaluation ) ? Methods and materials Participants In this study , 15 EDs and 15 student visual designers were in - vited to participate in an Electroencephalography ( EEG ) experi - ment . The inclusion criteria for EDs included ( i ) design - related work experience of more than 15 years , ( ii ) experience in lead - ing design teams specialising in visual design , and ( iii ) willing - ness to participate in the experiment . The inclusion criteria for student designers included ( i ) being a junior or senior majoring in design , ( ii ) being recommended by course instructors , and ( iii ) willingness to participate in the experiment . These criteria allowed for a degree of diversity in both groups to enable the exploration of two distinct ranges of designer experience . All the participants had no history of cardiovascular disorders or drug or alcohol abuse and had normal or corrected - to - normal vision . Because of incomplete participation and signal malfunc - tion , the EEG data of 11 EDs ( four women and seven men ; age : 31 – 39 years ) and 13 student designers ( eight women and five men ; age : 21 – 23 years ) were collected for further analysis . Equipment and materials The EEG headset used in this study was a 32 - channel inflat - able system designed by Brain Rhythm Inc . , Taiwan . The headset has two dry foam - based EEG sensors that are used only for the forehead Fp1 and Fp2 sites in the international 10 – 20 system . The system has 16 - bit quantisation and a sampling rate of 250 Hz . It features spring - loaded dry electrodes and a soft cap that can be used repeatedly on hairy sites without conductive gel . EEG data were wirelessly received through a Bluetooth protocol without the need for external cabling . The visual stimuli used in this study were 10 presentative paintings by Pablo Picasso , probably the most dominant and in - fluential artist of the first half of the twentieth century . Picasso often interchangeably used different styles such as symbolism , abstraction , and surrealism . These stimuli were selected for three reasons : ( i ) Robust evidence has determined that picto - rial representations exert a marked influence on design thinking [ 20 , 21 ] ; ( ii ) prior research has indicated that abstract sources with no defined form provide designers with freedom to ex - plore and imagine [ 20 , 22 ] ; and ( iii ) most of Picasso’s works were published prior to 1960 and are therefore classified as public domain works in most parts of the world . The usage of these artworks was restricted to use for the purpose of academic re - MedDocs Publishers 3 Journal of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences search in this study . The usage of these artworks was restricted for the purpose of academic research in this study . Some of the visual stimuli are displayed in the Appendix . Experimental procedure After signed consent forms were obtained , the participants were invited to sit in comfortable chairs and EEG electrode caps were placed on their heads . They were asked to minimise head and body movement and their baseline ( resting state ) brain responses were recorded . They were then instructed to spend approximately 2 minutes verbalising the design problem , pur - pose , and desired outcomes of an ongoing design project . The 10 paintings with questions corresponding to the indicators of initiating imagination ( i . e . , novelty and productivity ) were ran - domly displayed to the participants in the form of a prerecorded presentation on a 46 - inch TV monitor . Regarding the novelty indicator , each of the paintings was presented for 30 seconds . During the first 15 seconds , each participant was requested to silently respond to the following question : ‘What innovative ideas does this painting stimulate and inspire for the project you just mentioned ? ’ EEG data were subsequently recorded . During the second 15 seconds , each participant responded to the question , ‘How could these ideas improve the originally imagined outcome ? ’ The first question was related to idea generation , whereas the second was related to idea evaluation . Idea generation involves cycles of idea re - trieval and association through memory , whereas idea evalua - tion involves analysing usefulness and value [ 4 ] . Subsequently , the participants verbalised their answers for 2 . 5 minutes . All answers were tape recorded to assist the researchers in under - standing them . Regarding the productivity indicator , the participants were stimulated by the same set of paintings and asked the following questions : ‘What analogues does this painting stimulate and in - spire for the project you just mentioned ? ’ and ‘How could these analogues improve the originally imagined outcome ? ’ The pro - cedure for this session was the same as that for the previous session . Each painting experiment lasted 3 minutes , and thus the entire EEG measurement lasted 60 minutes . In total , the ex - periment was completed in approximately 90 minutes including the time required to explain the experiment , test the EEG head - set , and describe the project . The experimental process was identical for all participants to ensure enquiry quality . The ver - balisation session was aimed at acquiring qualitative data and treated as an intertrial interval to avoid recording overlapping brain responses . The qualitative data were collected for validity triangulation rather than scientific comparison between brain - wave activations and narrative contents . Data analyses The EEG data were inspected to remove ill - functioning chan - nels and first divided into 1 . 6 - second signals . Low - and high - pass filters with cutoff frequencies of 50 and 1 Hz , respectively , were applied to all signals based on finite impulse response filters to remove the line noise and direct - current drift [ 23 ] . Bad chan - nels were removed by kurtosis in EEGlab . We used 5 standard deviations from the mean as thresholds . Some epochs were ex - cluded manually due to electrical artifacts . The EEGLAB toolbox was used to decompose the filtered EEG signals through Inde - pendent Component Analysis ( ICA ) with the Infomax algorithm , where all components were grouped into several clusters based on outcome similarity . The signals of each IC were gained from the inner product of the EEG signals and ICA weighting matrix . Nonartefact in - dependent component scalp topographies often strongly re - semble the projection of a single dipole and all ICA components were grouped into several clusters according to outcome simi - larity by using the k - means clustering method [ 24 ] . The scalp topography of each independent component was used to plot the Three - Dimensional ( 3D ) location of an equivalent dipole through the DIPFIT plug - in . Each dipole represents the location of an independent component , as well as a specific cortex re - gion . A threshold of residual variance from the scalp projections of these dipoles was set as 15 % . Time - invariant correlations between clusters ( cortex re - gions ) were obtained by averaging the dipole signals of each cluster with correlation coefficients . Time - domain data were then transformed into frequency - domain data by using the fast Fourier transform function . The frequency - domain data were defined based on prior research [ 25 - 27 ] . The spectra of the EEG signals were separated into five frequency bands , namely delta ( 0 . 5 – 3 . 5 Hz ) , theta ( 3 . 5 – 8 Hz ) , alpha ( range : 8 – 13 Hz ; low : 8 – 9 Hz ; middle : 9 – 11 Hz ; high : 11 – 13 Hz ) , beta ( range : 13 – 30 Hz ; low : 13 – 16 Hz ; middle : 16 – 20 Hz ; high : 20 – 30 Hz ) , and gamma ( range : 30 – 100 Hz ; low : 30 – 60 Hz ; typical : 40 Hz ; high : > 60 Hz ) . Only low gamma bands ranging between 30 and 60 Hz were investigated in the present study because high gamma bands rarely appear in EEG results . A paired - sample Wilcoxon signed - rank test was performed to assess the differences in the brain activity spectra of the EDs and NDs . Results Regarding the novelty indicator , both the EDs and NDs ex - hibited relatively high brain activation in the prefrontal and bi - lateral frontotemporal regions when engaged in the idea gen - eration task ( Figure 1 ) . The colours of the scalp topographies indicate brain activity , with warm colours signifying higher activation and cold colours signifying lower activation . Figures 1a – 1d display the scalp topographies and 3D dipole plots and divide the brain activations into four major component clusters , namely the right prefrontal , left temporal , right temporal , and left frontal cortices . The correlations among these major com - ponent clusters are listed in Table 1 . Positive associations were observed between the right prefrontal and left temporal corti - ces and between the right temporal and left frontal cortices . The differences in spectral power between the EDs and NDs were clarified using the results of the Wilcoxon signed - rank test . The significance levels of the null hypothesis at different fre - quencies are shown as red dots in the spectra plots . As depicted in Figure 2a ( right prefrontal cluster ) , no significant power dif - ference was observed . In the left temporal cluster , only one sig - nificant power difference ( EDs > NDs ) was observed in the beta band at 21 Hz ( p = 0 . 033 ; Figure 2b ) . The results also indicated that two significant power differences ( EDs > NDs ) in the right temporal cluster were observed in the gamma band at 37 Hz ( p = 0 . 030 ) and the beta band at 18 Hz ( p = 0 . 044 ) ( Figure 2c ) . Fi - nally , in the left frontal cluster , two significant power differences ( NDs > EDs ) were observed in the beta band at 27 Hz ( p = 0 . 033 ) and the gamma band at 41 Hz ( p = 0 . 038 ) ( Figure 2d ) .

The scalp topographies and 3D dipole plots ( Figures 3a – 3d ) reveal that these brain activations can be separated into four major com - ponent clusters : the left temporal , right - biased middle frontal , right lateral frontal , and right temporal cortices . The right - biased middle frontal region is closely associated with the ACC . Table 2 lists the correlations among these major component clusters . The association between the right - biased middle frontal and right temporal cortices was noticeable and positive , whereas that between the right lateral frontal and right temporal corti - ces was markedly negative . As depicted in Figure 4a ( left temporal cluster ) , significant power differences ( NDs > EDs ) appeared in the distributed fre - quencies . The largest differences appeared in the beta band at 29 Hz ( p = 0 . 006 ) and 15 Hz ( p = 0 . 009 ) .

The scalp topographies and 3D dipole plots displayed in Figures 5a – 5d reveal that these brain activations can be separated into four major component clusters , namely the right medial parietal , middle frontal , right temporal , and left lateral parietal cortices . The right medial parietal region is located in the PCC , whereas the middle frontal region is situated in the ACC . The correlations among these major component clusters are listed in Table 3 . Relatively high levels of association were observed between the right medial parietal and middle frontal cortices , right medial parietal and left lateral parietal cortices , and middle frontal and left lateral parietal cortices . In the right medial parietal cluster ( Figure 6a ) , some signifi - cant power differences were observed . The largest differences ( EDs > NDs ) appeared in the alpha band at 8 Hz ( p = 0 . 005 ) and 10 Hz ( p = 0 . 009 ) . As depicted in Figure 6b , in the middle frontal cluster , no significant power differences were observed . In the right temporal cluster ( Figure 6c ) , significant power differences were observed at frequencies of 36 Hz or higher . The largest dif - ferences ( NDs > EDs ) appeared in the gamma band at 38 Hz ( p = 0 . 008 ) and 36 Hz ( p = 0 . 024 ) . Finally , in the left lateral parietal cluster ( Figure 6d ) , most significant power differences appeared at frequencies lower than 16 Hz . The largest differences ( EDs > NDs ) were observed in the delta band at 1 Hz ( p = 0 . 007 ) and the theta band at 7 Hz ( p = 0 . 007 ) . 5 . Root cluster 5b . Middle frontal cluster 5a .

Middle frontal cluster Figure 6 : Spectral power and Wilcoxon signed - rank test results for the productivity indicator during the idea generation task The participants exhibited high brain activation in the pre - frontal and frontal cortices when engaged in the idea evaluation task of the productivity indicator ( Figure 7 ) . The scalp topogra - phies and 3D dipole plots presented in Figures 7a and 7b reveal that these brain activations can be divided into two major com - ponent clusters , namely the right prefrontal and left frontal cor - tices . The correlation between these two clusters was relatively high . Our results indicated that two significant power differenc - es ( EDs > NDs ) in the right prefrontal cluster were observed in Discussion Novelty indicator for the idea generation task The results indicated that the prefrontal and bilateral fron - totemporal regions were activated during the experimental task . In particular , the activations in the right prefrontal , left temporal , right temporal , and left frontal cortices were evident . The major functions of the right temporal cortex are nonverbal memory and communication [ 28 ] , whereas the left frontal cor - tex is in charge of analogical reasoning . These capabilities are critical for making inferences and adapting to novelty [ 29 ] . The high correlation between the right temporal and left frontal cor - tices appears to enable designers to apply nonverbal memory for analogical reasoning to make novel inferences and generate ideas . The right prefrontal cortex is in charge of empathy and regu - lating emotional responses [ 30 , 31 ] , as well as visual association and insightful problem - finding processes [ 32 ] , thereby implying that emotional regulation and empathy facilitate creative asso - ciation and performance in designers . The left temporal cortex controls low - level perception , extending to verbal memory and comprehension . Optimum activity in the left temporal cortex enhances mood stability [ 33 , 34 ] . The coactivation of the right prefrontal and left temporal cortices appears to assist designers in regulating emotional responses , which may facilitate the ef - ficient augmentation of their cognitive capacities in recognising MedDocs Publishers 6 Journal of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences the gamma band at 34 Hz ( p = 0 . 021 ) and the theta band at 7 Hz ( p = 0 . 041 ) ( Figure 8a ) . Additionally , significant power differenc - es were observed at most frequencies in the left frontal cluster ( Figure 8b ) , where the largest differences appeared ( EDs > NDs ) in the alpha band at 11 Hz ( p = 0 . 001 ) and 10 Hz ( p = 0 . 001 ) . 7 .

As depicted in Figures 2a – 2d , the spectral powers of the EDs and NDs for the novelty indicator during the idea generation task were mostly similar . Although no significant power differences were observed in the right prefrontal cluster , one significant power difference ( EDs > NDs ) was observed in the beta band in the left temporal cluster , implying that EDs are more competent at consciously regulating emotions for novel ideation than are NDs . Additionally , the power differences ( EDs > NDs ) in the right temporal cluster and those ( NDs > EDs ) in the left frontal clus - ter appeared in the beta and gamma bands , implying that the EDs are more competent at using nonverbal memory , while the NDs are more competent at practicing analogical reasoning for novel ideation . Overall , these results implied that by optimising the designers’ capability to regulate emotions and use nonver - bal memory with abstract visual stimuli , NDs can enhance their ability to generate novel ideas . Novelty indicator for the idea evaluation task The EEG results indicated that the right frontal and temporal regions were activated during the idea evaluation task . In par - ticular , the activations of the left temporal , right - biased middle frontal , right lateral frontal , and right temporal cortices were noticeable . As previously stated , the left temporal cortex man - ages verbal memory and comprehension and its activation can improve mood stability [ 33 , 34 ] . The right - biased middle frontal region was closely associated with the ACC , which controls mne - monic conflict detection and resolution by monitoring differen - tial familiarity [ 35 ] . The negative correlation between these two regions ( Table 2 ) was minor slight but significant , implying that for the evaluation of idea novelty , the function of conflict man - agement can be used as a lever to facilitate emotional stability , and vice versa . The right frontal cortex is critical for the various types of di - vergent semantic processing involved in human creativity [ 36 ] and the right temporal cortex is crucial for nonverbal memory . The negative correlation between these two regions ( Table 2 ) implies that while a designer engages in an evaluation task involving idea novelty , depressing nonverbal communication may facilitate divergent semantic processing , and vice versa . In addition , the right - biased middle frontal region was positively correlated to the right temporal cortex , implying that activat - ing nonverbal communication could ease mnemonic conflict management . Synthesising these results yields the suggestion that the right temporal cortex plays a critical role in moderating the functions handled by the ACC in the idea novelty evaluation task . As depicted in Figures 4a – 4d , power differences ( NDs > EDs ) in the left temporal , right - biased middle frontal , and right tem - poral clusters were evident and the differences appeared in distributed frequencies . These results revealed that during the idea evaluation task , complicated interactions involving emo - tional stability , conflict management , and nonverbal memory were more active in the NDs than in the EDs . These results alone cannot definitively conclude that NDs are more competent than EDs in managing these intertwined interactions or that EDs ex - pend less energy than do NDs in reacting to interactions be - tween different brain regions . However , the critical role of emo - tion and the sophisticated relationships between regions close to the ACC during idea evaluation warrant further inquiry . Productivity indicator for the idea generation task During the idea generation task for the productivity indicator , noticeable activations in the right - biased middle frontoparietal region were detected . In particular , the activations in the right medial parietal , middle frontal , right temporal , and left lateral parietal cortices were manifest . The right medial parietal cortex is a crucial part of the PCC that serves to reinstate familiar con - textual information from memory [ 37 ] . The PCC exhibits a wide range of connectivity with the DMN , the activation of which is related to a high level of self - generated thought [ 11 , 17 ] . In addi - tion , the middle frontal cortex is associated with the ACC , which is involved in managing conflict detection and resolution [ 35 ] . The coactivations of these two regions ( Table 3 ) indicated that simultaneously managing mnemonic conflicts and focusing on internally directed thoughts may facilitate the fluency of idea generation in designers . Whereas the right temporal cortex is associated with non - verbal memory and information processing , the left parietal cortex promotes the flexible integration of prior knowledge to construct new ideas [ 38 ] . Thus , these results implied that de - signers adaptably integrate nonverbal memory to productively construct design ideas . The high correlation between the right medial parietal and left lateral parietal cortices ( Table 3 ) implies that the fluency of idea generation mainly relies on the flex - ible integration of self - generated thoughts , including autobio - graphical memory retrieval , episodic future thinking , and mind wandering based on personal experiences [ 16 , 39 ] . Moreover , the high correlation between the middle frontal and left lateral parietal cortices ( Table 3 ) implies that the fluency of design ide - ation depends on how efficiently the ACC detects and resolves mnemonic conflicts . During this task , the theta and alpha power of the EDs was generally higher than that of the NDs in all four component clusters . An increase in alpha power in the right parietal cluster is an indicator of the depth or elaborateness of an ongoing pro - cess of mental imagination [ 40 ] , through which EDs can outper - form NDs with respect to the fluency of design ideation . Previ - ous studies have reported that greater theta and alpha power reflects higher internal processing demand [ 18 , 41 ] . In addition , our results suggest that the EDs devoted more energy than the NDs to flexibly integrating past knowledge for idea construction ( left lateral parietal cortex ) . Furthermore , the activation of the right temporal cortex in the NDs was higher than that of the EDs in the gamma band , implying that NDs consciously use their nonverbal memory to facilitate the productivity of design ide - ation . Productivity indicator for the idea evaluation task During the idea evaluation task for the productivity indica - tor , noticeable activations were detected in the prefrontal and frontal regions . In particular , the activations of the right pre - frontal and left frontal cortices were prominent . As previously stated , the right prefrontal cortex plays a fundamental role in emotional regulation [ 30 , 31 ] . The left frontal cortex is in charge of analogical reasoning and concept formation and the nearby ACC maintains cognitive control for detecting and resolving conflicts . These results implied that the designers in this study perceived the idea evaluation process to entail conflict detec - tion , monitoring , and resolution , as well as the evaluation of idea productivity to improve outcomes through emotional reg - ulation—possibly to facilitate assessment efficiency . The high correlation between the right prefrontal and left frontal corti - MedDocs Publishers 7 Journal of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences ces ( Table 4 ) represents the necessary coactivation of these two regions in idea productivity evaluation . As depicted in Figures 8a and 8b , the spectral power of the EDs was generally higher than that of the NDs for the novelty indicator during the idea generation task . Two significant power differences were observed in the theta and gamma bands in the right prefrontal cluster , implying that EDs are more competent at regulating emotions for ideation productivity than are NDs . In addition , the power differences ( EDs > NDs ) in the left fron - tal cluster appeared at most frequencies , implying that EDs are more competent at analogical reasoning and concept formation than are NDs . Taken together , these results implied that by op - timising their capability for emotional regulation and analogi - cal reasoning , NDs’ can enhance their ability to evaluate idea productivity . Research limitations This study had several limitations . First , EEG enabled the waveform elicited by certain tasks to be determined through av - eraging several trials . However , its low spatial resolution on the scalp hinders the tracing of the exact point in the brain where an activity originates , particularly regarding those in the me - dial or orbital regions related to human emotions . Second , the experimental stimuli used in the present study were limited to the paintings of Picasso . Additional visual representations and other forms of stimuli ( e . g . , drawings , photos , videos , music , and 3D objects ) could be employed . Third , neuroscientific stud - ies have typically investigated simple cognitive processes by us - ing repeatable tasks . However , designer imagination and design thinking are multifaceted mental activities , and thus creating reliable and valid experimental processes and settings in which the research objective can be fulfilled is challenging . Finally , we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the participants had multiple and mixed ideas , which may have hindered the interpretation of idea generation and evaluation . Closing remarks / Conclusion Based on the results , several practical implications can be derived . ( i ) By optimising their capability to regulate emotions and use nonverbal memory , designers can enhance their abil - ity to generate novel ideas . ( ii ) By leveraging their capability for emotional management , conflict detection , and nonverbal memory , designers can facilitate their evaluation of novel ideas . ( iii ) By augmenting their capability for mnemonic conflict man - agement and autobiographical memory retrieval , particularly in terms of theta and alpha power , designers can improve their productivity regarding idea generation . ( iv ) By enriching their capability for emotional management and analogical reasoning , designers can increase their assessment efficiency as regards idea evaluation . EDs are expected to be responsible for concep - tualisation , creative development , and final design execution . The aforementioned practical implications provide insightful suggestions for ideation enhancement that can be applied in in - service training and formal design education . Experience enables designers to overcome diverse obstacles during their professional lives . As demonstrated in the present study , neuroscience provides instruments and methods that can be applied to study design competencies . The results of this study provide new evidence to facilitate future studies of de - signer imagination and new insights to differentiate the cogni - tive processes of visual designers of various experience levels . We hope that these ideas will stimulate future research , the de - velopment of novel paradigms , and critical scientific exchange between the research communities involved in understanding different aspects of designer imagination . Through this discus - sion , we hope that building blocks and essential frameworks will be established to serve as guides to the prolific world of the human imagination . References 1 .
