Little is known about the variance in these cytoplasmic properties . Here , we employed particle - tracking nano - rheology on genetically encoded multimeric 40 - nm nanoparticles ( GEMs ) to measure diffusion within the cytoplasm of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe . We found that the apparent diffusion coefficients of individual GEM particles varied over a 400 - fold range , while the average particle diffusivity for each individual cell spanned a 10 - fold range . To determine the origin of this heterogeneity , we developed a Doppelgӓnger Simulation approach that uses stochastic simulations of GEM diffusion that replicate the experimental statistics on a particle - by - particle basis , such that each experimental track and cell had a one - to - one correspondence with their simulated counterpart . These simulations showed that the large intra - and inter - cellular variations in diffusivity could not be explained by experimental variability but could only be reproduced with stochastic models that assume an equally wide intra - and inter - cellular variation in cytoplasmic viscosity . To probe the origin of this variation , we found that the variance in GEM diffusivity was largely independent of factors such as temperature , cytoskeletal effects , cell cycle stage and spatial locations , but was magnified by hyperosmotic shocks . Taken together , our results provide a striking demonstration that the cytoplasm is not “well - mixed” but represents a highly heterogeneous environment in which subcellular components at the 40 - nm size - scale experience dramatically different effective viscosities within an individual cell , as well as in different cells in the population . These findings carry significant implications for the origins and regulation of biological noise at cellular and subcellular levels . Main Text Introduction Life at the molecular scale is stochastic , with macromolecules continually being jostled by Brownian motion . This emergence of “biological noise” at the molecular level permeates all aspects of cell biology , inducing stochastic fluctuations in subcellular processes and driving natural variation among cells in a population . Critical roles for biological noise in signaling ( Huang et al . , 2016 ) , cell size control ( Facchetti et al . , 2019 ; Patterson et al . , 2019 ; Schmoller , 2017 ) , organelle size scaling ( Chang and Marshall , 2017 ; Gray et al . , 2019 ; Mohapatra et al . , 2016 ) , and gene expression ( Battich et al . , 2015 ; Oates , 2011 ; Raj and van Oudenaarden , 2008 ; Raser and O’Shea , 2005 ) . In general , biological noise presents a challenge to cellular homeostasis and signaling mechanisms , and is often suppressed in order for biological functions to be robust . For example , signaling frequently depends on strong amplification of initially weak signals , which can erroneously amplify noise unless proofreading mechanisms are in place ( Huang et al . , 2016 ) . However , biological noise can also confer a selective advantage . In a fluctuating and unpredictable environment , biological variation between cells in an isogenic population can ensure population - level survival ( Levien et al . , 2021 ; Suderman et al . , 2017 ) . One potentially significant source of biological noise that has been largely ignored is that of heterogeneity in the cell cytoplasm . The cytoplasm is composed of a highly diverse and actively - mixed assembly of resident macromolecules of various size ( Milo and Phillips , 2015 ; Requião et al . , 2017 ) , charge ( Requião et al . , 2017 ) , and hydrophobicity ( White and Jacobs , 1990 ) . The complexity of the cytoplasmic milieu could influence molecules ' behavior locally . Indeed , spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the diffusion of particles has been observed in multiple contexts such as E . coli , fungi , mammalian cells and even Xenopus egg extract using methods ranging from fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ) to particle tracking ( Bakshi et al . , 2011 ; Baum et al . , 2014 ; Dross et al . , 2009 ; Huang et al . , 2021 ; Manley et al . , 2008 ; McLaughlin et al . , 2020 ; Scipioni et al . , 2018 ; Xiang et al . , 2020 ) . Heterogeneity of cytoplasmic properties have potentially far - reaching effects in cell biology , as the cytoplasm hosts a wide variety of critical molecular processes ranging from protein synthesis and turnover , to cytoskeletal transport and force production , metabolism , and beyond ( Cadart et al . , 2019 ; Neurohr and Amon , 2020 ) . Further , changes to physical cytoplasmic properties such as the macromolecular density , viscosity , and degree of crowding have been shown to impart widespread effects within the cell ー including sudden and significant impacts on growth and viability ( Knapp et al . , 2019 ; Tsai et al . , 2019 ) . For example , altering cytoplasmic crowding by changing the concentration of ribosomes has strong effects on phase separation ( Delarue et al . , 2018 ) , and high osmotic shocks can completely halt microtubule dynamics ( Molines et al . , 2022 ) . Additionally , alterations in cytoplasmic density have been implicated in cellular aging and senescence ( Neurohr et al . , 2019 ) and differentiation ( Guo et al . , 2017 ) . Here we establish a combined experimental and computational approach to examine cytoplasmic heterogeneity through the lens of diffusion . Single particle motion - tracking allows for a robust quantification and statistical analysis of particle behavior , revealing variations between particles which would otherwise be averaged out in bulk measurements obtained in photobleaching ( e . g . FRAP ) and FCS ( Charras et al . , 2009 ; Neurohr and Amon , 2020 ) experiments . Further , this kind of “passive” rheology approach requires minimal perturbations to the cell . Previously , particle tracking rheology on fluorescent proteins has proven difficult due to their fast diffusion rates and tendency to photobleach . The development of GEMs ( Genetically Encoded Multimeric nanoparticles ) ( Delarue et al . , 2018 ) ) , has enabled large improvements on this front . These bright and photostable protein spheres are expressed as fluorescently - tagged monomers which self - assemble into hollow shells of nearly - uniform size and shape ( Delarue et al . , 2018 ; Szórádi et al . , 2021 ) . Because each particle contains tens of fluorescent proteins , they can be tracked for relatively long periods of time without photobleaching . Additionally , the near - diffusive movements of GEMs suggest they do not interact strongly with eukaryotic cellular components , making them ideal reagents for rheological studies ( Delarue et al . , 2018 ; McLaughlin et al . , 2020 ) . Critically , their relatively large size and slow diffusion rates - comparable to large protein complexes such as ribosomes - allow GEMs to be tracked using modern high - speed cameras ( which is still not attainable for individual fluorescent proteins ) . Initial studies have established their utility in quantitatively probing diffusion and crowing in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm in various cell types including yeast and mammalian cells ( Alric et al . , 2021 ; Carlini et al . , 2020 ; Delarue et al . , 2018 ; Lemière et al . , 2021 ; McLaughlin et al . , 2020 ; Molines et al . , 2022 ; Szórádi et al . , 2021 ) . The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe provides an excellent model system for the study of cytoplasmic heterogeneity because of their uniformity in many other aspects of their cell biology . In standard laboratory conditions , these rod - shaped cells exhibit very tight distributions in their cell size at division ( CV ~ 6 % ; ( Facchetti et al . , 2019 ; Patterson et al . , 2019 ) ) and cell shape ( Abenza et al . , 2015 ; Davì et al . , 2018 ; Saunders et al . , 2012 ) , as well as cell cycle progression and intracellular density ( CV ~ 10 % ; ( Odermatt et al . , 2021 ) ) . The relatively low phenotypic variability within and between fission yeast cells permits the study of cytoplasmic heterogeneity in a well - controlled system in the presence of minimal confounding factors . Using live cell high - speed imaging and quantitative tracking of 40 nm - diameter GEMs in Schizosaccharomyces pombe , we measured cytoplasmic diffusivity for thousands of individual particles . These data revealed large heterogeneity in diffusion coefficients both within single cells as well as between cells in the population . To analyze this variability , we developed an automated pipeline , which we call the Doppelgӓnger Simulation approach , to reproduce our experimental results computationally using simulations of diffusion , and assay heterogeneity using statistical techniques for analysis of variance . Using these methods , we showed that orders of magnitude of variability in GEM cytoplasmic diffusivity within and between cells arose from an equally wide distribution of cytoplasmic viscosity . This variance was not affected by temperature , the cytoskeleton , or cell size , but was increased by hyperosmotic shock . Our studies support a growing body of evidence that the cytoplasm is not physically well - mixed ( Bakshi et al . , 2011 ; Baum et al . , 2014 ; Dross et al . , 2009 ; Manley et al . , 2008 ; McLaughlin et al . , 2020 ; Weiss and Korge , 2001 ; Xiang et al . , 2020 ) and reveal this heterogeneity in diffusion as an important potential source of biological noise . Results Statistical characterization of cytoplasmic GEM particle diffusion in fission yeast To assay cytoplasmic diffusion in fission yeast , we expressed 40 nm - diameter GEM nanoparticles in wildtype S . pombe from a multicopy plasmid on an inducible promoter ( Molines et al . , 2022 ) . Tuning the expression of the GEMs construct allowed us to titrate particle formation to small number of particles ( < 10 ) per cell . To reduce environmental variability , these unicellular cells were grown at 30 °C under optimal conditions in shaking liquid cultures to exponential growth phase and mounted in imaging chambers with fixed dimensions under constant temperature and imaged acutely . Using variable angle epifluorescence microscopy ( VAEM ) ( Delarue et al . , 2018 ; Konopka and Bednarek , 2008 ; Lemière et al . , 2021 ; Molines et al . , 2022 ) we tracked GEM particle motion at 100 Hz for 10 s , as described previously ( Delarue et al . , 2018 ; Lemière et al . , 2021 ; Molines et al . , 2022 ) ( Fig . 1a - b , Methods ) . Each field of view ( FOV ) contained multiple cells that were individualized post - acquisition . Images were manually curated to eliminate from the data set a small subset of cells that had died , exhibited grossly abnormal morphologies , or contained a single bright aggregate of GEM particles . From a dataset of 145 cells , 3681 tracks were analyzed , with an average of 25 ± 10 ( AVG ± SD ) tracks per cell , a mean step size of 104 ± 72 nm ( AVG ± SD ) , and a mean track length of 273 ± 268 ms ( AVG ± SD ) ( Fig . 1c ) .

( b ) Example brightfield image ( top left ) and maximum intensity projection through time of the GEM particle fluorescence ( top right ) for one representative field of view , alongside the measured nanoparticle trajectories ( bottom ) for the upper cell in the image .

Note that tracks shorter than 10 time - points were not included in the analysis . ( d ) The mean - squared displacement ( MSD ) of the particle tracks . The time - averaged MSD was first calculated individually for each track , and then a second averaging was performed to find the ( ensemble averaged ) MSD across all tracks .

( d - e ) Error bars represent the standard error . ( f ) Plots of particle trajectories drawn from many experiments and cells , randomly subsampled for better visibility of individual particle behaviors . Subsampled trajectories include at least one track from 141 of the 145 cells in the dataset . Gray indicates the mean step size across all tracks in the dataset . ( c - f ) Dataset includes 3681 tracks among 145 cells , recorded from 5 different samples and over 3 different days . ( g ) Individual trajectory plots for five of the longest - tracked particles ( in time ) , excluding stationary particles . Color scaling of the step size was identical in all panels included in f - g ( using the mean and standard deviation of the step size across the entire dataset ) . From these trajectories we computed the time - averaged , ensemble - averaged ( i . e . , track - averaged ) Mean Squared Displacement ( MSD ) as a function of time offset , and fitted the resulting MSD curve to a power law ( Fig . 1d , Methods ) . MSD analysis showed that GEM particle motion in the cytoplasm was largely diffusive ( MSD ≈ Dτ ) , following a robust power law with apparent diffusivity D app , 100ms = 0 . 3 ± 2 * 10 - 3 µm 2 / sec ( AVG ± CI ) and anomalous diffusion exponent ⍺ = 0 . 92 ± 5 * 10 - 3 ( AVG ± CI ) , which were similar to previously published measurements in fission yeast ( Lemière et al . , 2021 ; Molines et al . , 2022 ) . The diffusivity of the 40 nm GEMs in the cytoplasm was roughly 40 times slower than the theoretical prediction for simple Stokes - Einstein diffusion in water - - and corresponded to the particle’s expected diffusion rate in a 75 % glycerol solution in water . We note that diffusion along the long and short axes of the cell were comparable by our measurements ( Fig . S1a ) , and we found that the MSD plots do not plateau , indicating that diffusion of the GEMs was not confined on timescales less than a second ( e . g . , most particles do not run into the cell wall within the measured time window ) . The time - averaged , ensemble - averaged ( i . e . , track - averaged ) velocity autocorrelation of particle trajectories was also consistent with simple unconstrained diffusion ( Fig . 1e ) . Notably , the autocorrelation plot lacked the characteristic negative peak associated with subdiffusive motion and viscoelastic response seen in other systems ( Fig . S1b - c ) ( Guigas et al . , 2007 ; Tolić - Nørrelykke et al . , 2004 ; Weber et al . , 2010 , 2012a ) . Therefore , at least with this approach at this 40 - nm size scale , we detected no elastic response in the yeast cytoplasm . Cytoplasmic diffusivity spans orders of magnitude We next analyzed individual particle tracks , which revealed a rich phenotypic variability ( Fig . 1f - g ) that was obscured by the ensemble averaging - based analysis described above ( e . g . , MSD - Fig . 1d ) . Notably , even within a single trace , individual particles exhibited large fluctuations in their step size ( Fig . 1g ) . To investigate the variety of comportment displayed by individual particles , we calculated and fit the time - averaged MSD individually for each track ( Fig . 2a ) and the time - averaged , ensemble - averaged MSD over all tracks in each cell ( Fig . 2b ) . These data showed that variability in particle motion ranged over orders of magnitude ; fits of particle and cell MSDs ( Fig . 2c - d ) showed that diffusivity follows a long - tailed , log - scale distribution , consistent with Brownian motion in a heterogeneous environment ( Santos et al . , 2020 ; Ślęzak and Burov , 2021 ) . The distribution of apparent diffusivities exhibited a single peak ( Fig . 2c - f ) , which appeared more normally - distributed in log space ( Fig . 2f ) than in real space ( Fig . 2e ) . Therefore , we performed all further statistics and visualization on the log 10 of the fitted apparent diffusivities . The median of the diffusivity distribution in log space , which we then converted to real space ( see Methods ) , corresponded to a diffusivity of 0 . 29 µm 2 / sec for the track - wise distribution and 0 . 33 µm 2 / sec for the cell - wise distribution , both similar to the bulk estimate . The standard deviation of the diffusivity distribution in log space ( representing the number of orders of magnitude spanned by the dataset ) can be converted to real space as a fold - range at 2 . 5 standard deviations away from the median ( see Methods ) , giving a 392 - fold range across tracks and 11 - fold range across cells . We chose 2 . 5σ as our cutoff as it gave a range consistent with our outlier estimation algorithm ( Fig . 2c , see caption ) . Overall , we showed that diffusivities vary by over 2 . 5 orders of magnitude among individual GEMs and one order of magnitude among cells . Hereafter we use the terms inter cellular variation to refer to the spread of the cell - wise diffusivity ( Fig . 2c , right ) and intra cellular variation to indicate the spread in the track - wise diffusivity ( Fig . 2c , left ) .

( e - f ) The same distributions of the fitted apparent diffusivities plotted in ( c ) , now plotted as a histogram either in real space ( e ) or log space ( f ) . Probabilities represent the probability density per histogram bin width , such that the sum of the bin heights multiplied by the bin width equals 1 . ( g - h ) Results from a nested ANOVA performed on track - wise fits of diffusivities ( g ) and power law exponents ( h ) . The amount of the experimentally - observed variance that can be explained by track - to - track , cell - to - cell , imaging session - to - session , and day - to - day variability is plotted as a fraction of the total variance . ( a - h ) Dataset is identical to that shown in Fig . 1 c - f , including 3681 tracks among 145 cells , recorded from 5 different samples and over 3 different days . To understand whether variation arose from cell - to - cell variability , from different microenvironments within a single cell , or from experimental day - to - day variation , we performed an Analysis of Variance ( ANOVA ) on the track - wise diffusivity measurements ( Fig . 2g ) . The ANOVA revealed that the vast majority ( ~ 80 % ) of the measured spread in diffusivity came from intracellular variation ( i . e . , Track in Fig . 2g ) , but there was also a significant amount of variance ( ~ 20 % ) explained by cell - to - cell variability ( i . e . , Cell in Fig . 2g ) . Only < 1 % could be attributed to experiment - to - experiment variability . Similar results were observed for the fitted anomalous diffusion exponent ( Fig . 2d , h ) , which was not surprising given the strong correlation between the fitted apparent diffusivities and power law exponents in our dataset ( Supp . Fig . 2a ) . Another common way to differentiate sources of noise in biological data is to separate the observed spread into intrinsic ( uncorrelated within cells ) and extrinsic ( correlated within cells ) components ( Bauer et al . , 2021 ; Raj and van Oudenaarden , 2008 ) . Our ANOVA results suggested that noise in this system was almost entirely intrinsic , as ~ 80 % of the variation was maintained after controlling for cell - to - cell variability . Indeed , by plotting the apparent diffusivities of random pairs of GEM particles , where each pair is randomly chosen from particles within a single cell , we found that the noise had only a very weak correlation between particles within the same cell ( Spearman correlation : r = 0 . 21 , p = 5 * 10 - 35 , Supp . Fig . 2b ) . We noted that the large intercellular and intracellular variation observed in our data cannot be explained by differences in GEM particle expression levels , as the mean apparent diffusivity among track - wise diffusivity fits within a cell was not significantly correlated with the number of tracks in the cell ( Spearman correlation : r = - 0 . 003 , p = 0 . 97 , Supp . Fig . 2c ) , and the coefficient of variation among track - wise diffusivity values within a cell was only very weakly correlated with the number of tracks in the cell ( Spearman correlation : r = 0 . 25 , p = 0 . 004 , Supp . Fig . 2d ) . In addition , the coefficient of variation of particle diffusivities within each cell was ~ 1 , and was uncorrelated with the mean particle diffusivity across all particles in the cell , consistent with Poisson statistics ( Spearman correlation : r = - 0 . 1 , p = 0 . 15 , Supp . Fig . 2e ) . Stochastic simulations demonstrate that spread is not due solely to statistical measurement noise As diffusion is an inherently stochastic process , we next explored whether the measured variation in particle mobility was due to statistical properties of our measurements . It is known , for example , that datasets with shorter track lengths will produce wider distributions of measured diffusivities ( Weber et al . , 2010 ) . We therefore developed what we called the Doppelgӓnger Simulation ( DS ) approach , employing a custom algorithm to automatically read in and replicate the experimental measurement statistics in silico cell - for - cell and track - for - track ( Fig . 3a ) . With DS , simulated cells have the exact same cell length and number of tracks as their experimentally - measured counterparts , and each simulated track has an identical length ( i . e . , number of time points tracked ) to the associated experimental trajectory . This straightforward and powerful approach allowed us to produce simulated data that could be directly compared to the experimental tracks and analyzed using identical statistical methods . Using DS , particle motion was then recapitulated using stochastic Brownian dynamics simulations of diffusion inside a box representing the exterior cell boundary ( Fig . 3 ) . We opted for a simple diffusion model because GEM particle motion is observed experimentally to be largely diffusive ( Fig . 1d ) and did not display characteristics of constrained or viscoelastic behavior ( Fig . 1d - e ) . The model assumes an average cytoplasm viscosity forty times that of water , giving a mean diffusivity of 0 . 35 μm 2 / s that closely matches that of the experimental data . The simplest iteration of the model ( Fig . 3b - f , Model # 1 : uniform viscosity ) , which we will hereafter refer to as the uniform viscosity model ( due to its assumption of constant viscosity within and among cells ) , accounted for only a fraction of the experimentally - measured spread in GEM particle mobility ( Fig . 3d - f ) – including ~ 50 % of the track - to - track variability in diffusivity , and < 10 % of the cell - to - cell variability , as measured by ANOVA ( Fig . 3f ) . We therefore concluded that neither the stochastic nature of diffusion nor the statistical properties of our experimental measurement statistics were the major source of heterogeneity in GEM particle diffusion . Simulations suggest that heterogeneity in diffusion must arise from an equally vast spread in cytoplasmic viscosity . As the data set of experimentally - measured GEM particle motion fitted well to a model of simple diffusion , there were only a finite number of sources in this simple model from which heterogeneity in mobility could arise . The major parameter defining diffusion is the diffusivity , D , which theoretically ( by the Stokes - Einstein equation ) is simply equal to the ratio of the thermal energy , k B T , to the viscous drag on the particle , γ . For a spherical particle , γ = 6πηR , where η is the viscosity of the cytoplasm and R is the radius of the particle ( Einstein , 1905 ) . Of these parameters , viscosity is the only parameter that could be varying within and between cells , as temperature is held constant and the radii of GEM nanoparticles have been shown by electron microscopy to be fairly uniform ( CV ≈ 0 . 1 ) when expressed in mammalian and budding yeast cells ( Delarue et al . , 2018 ) .

The percent of the experimentally - observed cell - to - cell and track - to - track variability that can be explained by each of the models . ( g ) The distribution of cytoplasmic viscosities , shown relative to the viscosity of water , needed to most closely reproduce the experimental data ( i . e . , simulations from Model # 4 , using the same parameters used to generate ( c - f ) ) . Histograms are shown for the distribution of average cell viscosities ( intercellular heterogeneity , red dashed line ) and the distribution of intracellular viscosities for three example cells ( blue lines of varying darkness ) . The examples include a cell whose average viscosity equals that of the cell - wide average ( medium blue line ) , a cell with an average viscosity three standard deviations above the cell - wide average ( dark blue line ) , and a cell with an average viscosity three standard deviations below the cell - wide average ( light blue line ) . Note the logarithmic scale along the x - axis . The simulation did not allow viscosities below that of water . We therefore generated three other versions of our model incorporating viscosity variation ( Fig . 3b ) , while keeping the mean viscosity ( and thus mean particle diffusivity ) constant ( Fig . 3c ) . In one version , which we refer to as the spatial heterogeneity model ( Fig . 3 , Model # 2 : spatial heterogeneity ) , we aimed to explore whether intracellular spatial variations in viscosity could account for the experimentally measured spread in diffusivity . A spatially varying viscosity was consistent with the observation that individual particles can display significant variations in step size within a single track ( Fig . 1g ) . This model assumed that viscosity varies across the cell with a fixed domain size , approximated by a grid of discrete viscosity domains where each region was randomly assigned a distinct viscosity value . The average cellular viscosity was held constant . In another variation of the model , termed the cellular heterogeneity model , viscosity was uniform within each cell , but the uniform viscosity value varied between cells ( Fig . 3 , Model # 3 : cellular heterogeneity ) . Finally , we developed a fourth model combining both intracellular and intercellular heterogeneity , which we called the combined heterogeneity model ( Fig . 3 , Model # 4 : combined heterogeneity ) . In all three variations on the original model , viscosity values were chosen from a log - normal distribution , mimicking the distribution of the experimentally - measured step sizes ( Fig . 1c , middle ) and diffusivities ( Fig . 2f ) . We then ran each model multiple times to account for their stochastic nature and assayed whether each model could reproduce the experimentally - observed spread in diffusivity ( 1 ) as measured by ANOVA ( Fig . 3f ) , and ( 2 ) such that the variance was not statistically significantly different from the experiments according to Levene’s test for equality of variances ( Fig . 3d - e ) ( Levene , 1960 ) . While the spatial heterogeneity model could only account for the track - to - track variation in experimentally - measured diffusivity ( but not the cell - to - cell variation ) , and the cellular heterogeneity model could only reproduce the cell - to - cell variation ( but not the track - to - track variation ) , only the model combining both spatial and cellular heterogeneity could fully reproduce the amount of spread observed in the experimental data ( Fig . 3d - f ) . Further , only a viscosity variation spanning orders of magnitude ( Fig . 3g ) could quantitatively recapitulate the experimentally - measured spread . In particular , the viscosity was required to vary 10 - fold among cells , 100 - fold within any individual cell , and 400 - fold across the dataset in order to best match the experiments . Overall , our simulations showed that our data is best explained by a model in which effective viscosity experienced by cytoplasmic GEMs particles varies drastically within and between cells . Heterogeneity in diffusion does not arise from density fluctuations related to the cell cycle or cell tip growth We next tested what factors might be responsible for such a large heterogeneity in cytoplasmic viscosity . Within an asynchronous population , fission yeast cells exhibit an approximately two - fold range in cell size , which corresponds to the cell cycle stage ( Mitchison , 1957 ) . A recent study used quantitative phase imaging ( QPI ) to show that the overall intracellular dry - mass density of fission yeast cells fluctuates over the cell cycle , with density decreasing during interphase and increasing during mitosis and cytokinesis ( Odermatt et al . , 2021 ) . To test whether GEM diffusion also varies over the cell cycle , we examined the relationship of GEM diffusion with cell length as a proxy for cell cycle stage ( Supp . Fig . 3a - b ) . We detected no significant correlation of diffusivity with cell length , making it unlikely that the cell to cell variability in GEM diffusion is cell cycle dependent . We next tested whether spatial variations of density could explain the variability of GEM diffusion . QPI experiments demonstrated a subtle gradient of intracellular density in a subset of fission yeast cells , in which growing cell tips generally appear to be less dense than the rest of the cell ( Odermatt et al . , 2021 ) . Regional cytoplasmic differences have also been shown in Ashbya gossypii , in which GEMs have decreased diffusivity in the perinuclear region ( McLaughlin et al . , 2020 ) . To test for spatial variations in fission yeast , we mapped the GEM tracks relative to their positions in the cell ( Supp . Fig . 3c - d ) . This analysis yielded no obvious regional differences in diffusivity within the fission yeast cell ; specifically , we noted no strong differences in diffusion at growing cell tips or at the perinuclear regions . Therefore , it is unlikely that systematic regional differences in intracellular density are responsible for the variance in diffusivity . Variance in diffusion is impacted by osmotic shock but not by cytoskeletal or temperature perturbations . We then probed what factors could affect the variance by submitting the cells to different perturbations . For each perturbation , we measured the distribution of track - wise and cell - wise fits of GEM diffusivities , and performed the Wilcoxon rank sum non - parametric test for equality of medians ( Mann and Whitney , 1947 ) and Levene’s test for equality of variances ( Levene , 1960 ) to establish whether changes to the median and variance were statistically significant ( Methods ) . One cytoplasmic constituent implicated in the rheological properties of the cytoplasm is the cytoskeleton . A rigid and interconnected cytoskeleton network can act as a barrier ( Potma et al . , 2001 ) , or elastically resist particle motion – properties which can be described by poroelastic models ( Charras et al . , 2009 ; Moeendarbary et al . , 2013 ) . In addition , the cytoskeleton is responsible for transporting and positioning organelles and “actively mixes” the cytoplasm ( Brangwynne et al . , 2008 ) . The cytoskeleton may also create structured intracellular regions with distinct biophysical properties ( Fletcher and Mullins , 2010 ) . We used a combination of latrunculin A ( LatA ) and methyl benzimidazol - 2 - yl - carbamate ( MBC ) to depolymerize actin and microtubules in interphase fission yeast cells ( Fig . 4a ) . This treatment however had only subtle effects on GEM diffusivity ; we detected a small , statistically insignificant increase in the median diffusivity ( Fig . 4d , Wilcoxon t - test , Track - wise fits : 6 % increase , p - value = 0 . 17 ; Cell - wise fits : 18 % increase , p - value = 0 . 3 ) , and a small , statistically insignificant increase in the variance ( Fig . 4g , j , Levene test , Track - wise fits : 71 % increase , p - value = 0 . 08 ; Cell - wise fits : 27 % increase , p - value = 0 . 18 ) ) . We therefore concluded that the cytoskeleton is not the main determinant of cytoplasmic viscosity or variance at the 40 - nm size scale in fission yeast . Another main determinant of diffusivity D is temperature T . In addition to purely physical effects of temperature of diffusion as defined by the Stokes - Einstein equation where D ∝ T . temperature can also have also a multitude of biological effects . For instance , temperature shifts may alter active mixing of the cytoplasm ( Weber et al . , 2012b ) , and trigger viscosity adaptation mechanisms via production of viscogens ( Persson et al . , 2020 ) . There are also reports of regional differences in effective temperature within single cells ( Chrétien et al . , 2018 ; Hayashi et al . , 2015 ; Okabe et al . , 2012 ) . To assay the effects of temperature on GEMs diffusivity , we grew fission yeast cells overnight at 30 °C , and then imaged them ~ 5 min after shifting cells down to 20 °C ( Fig . 4b ) . This 10 ˚C decrease in temperature corresponds to ≈ 3 % decrease in the absolute temperature ( in Kelvin ) , and thus the Stokes - Einstein equation predicted a similar decrease in diffusivity . We observed a slightly larger than predicted drop in the median track - wise diffusivity of GEMs ( Fig . 4e , Wilcoxon test , Track - wise fits : 11 % decrease , p - value = 0 . 03 ; Cell - wise fits : 6 % decrease , p - value = 0 . 54 ) . The track - wise variance exhibited a statistically significant decrease , but Figure 4 : Heterogeneity in cytoplasmic diffusion has varied responsiveness to experimental perturbations .

( d - l ) * p < 0 . 05 . * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 , * * * * p < 0 . 0001 . the cell - wise variance did not change significantly ( Levene test , Track - wise fits : 49 % decrease , p - value = 0 . 006 ; Cell - wise fits : 28 % decrease , p - value = 0 . 43 ) . Overall , increasing the temperature had no effect on cell - to - cell variation but slightly increased intracellular heterogeneity . Finally , we tested the effects of osmotic shocks . Osmotic shocks acutely alter the concentration of molecules in the cytoplasm by removal or addition of water ( Knapp et al . , 2019 ; Lemière et al . , 2021 ; Molines et al . , 2022 ) . We performed hyperosmotic shocks with 1 M and 1 . 5 M sorbitol ( which roughly doubles the concentration of the cytoplasm ; Fig . 4c ) . Consistent with previous reports ( Lemière et al . , 2021 ; Molines et al . , 2022 ) , these hyper - osmotic shocks induced a striking decrease in the median track - averaged diffusivity of GEM particles compared to control experiments ( Wilconox t - test , Track - wise fits : 93 % and 96 % decreases , p - values = 5 * 10 - 273 , 3 * 10 - 153 for 1 M and 1 . 5 M shocks , respectively ; Cell - wise fits : 92 % and 94 % decreases , p - values = 3 * 10 - 21 , 4 * 10 - 10 for 1 M and 1 . 5 M , respectively ) . Interestingly , it also induced a sizable increase in both the track - wise and cell - wise variance in measured diffusivity ( Fig . 4 i , l , Levene test , Track - wise fits : 275 % and 420 % increases , p - values = 1 * 10 - 9 , 2 * 10 - 10 for 1 M and 1 . 5 M shocks , respectively ; Cell - wise fits : 530 % and 16 , 083 % increases , p - values = 4 * 10 - 4 , 3 * 10 - 9 for 1 M and 1 . 5 M , respectively ) . Thus we found that increasing the concentration of the cytoplasm slowed diffusion but also drastically increased both intracellular and intercellular cytoplasmic heterogeneity . These results suggest that hyperosmotic shocks may make the cytoplasm even more heterogeneous . Discussion Here we used a combined experimental and theoretical analysis to reveal a high degree of cytoplasmic heterogeneity experienced by objects on the scale of large protein complexes . In particular , our results indicated the effective cytoplasmic viscosity in fission yeast varies more than 10 - fold among cells , and 100 - fold within cells . Although the source of this heterogeneity is not yet understood , our analyses showed that viscosity variation is independent of the cytoskeleton , cell cycle stage , and temperature – but increases under hyperosmotic shock . Generalizability of cytoplasmic heterogeneity It is highly likely that the large diffusive heterogeneity we observed in fission yeast is generalizable to most , if not all , cell types . In fact , because fission yeast exhibit strikingly regular cell shape and growth properties , they may be expected to have much less cytoplasmic variability than many other systems . Although most previous work has not explicitly focused on variability , studies of GEM particle diffusion in the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm of budding yeast , the filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii , Xenopus egg extract , and several mammalian cell types ( Delarue et al . , 2018 ; Huang et al . , 2021 ; Szórádi et al . , 2021 ) , as well as other studies of diffusion in E . coli ( Parry et al . , 2014 ) , show that comparable variability in diffusion exists in these diverse contexts . In particular , McLaughlin et al . reported sizeable variation in both inter - and intra - cellular heterogeneity of GEM diffusivity in Ashbya ( McLaughlin et al . , 2020 ) . Beyond measurements of diffusion , a study directly probing viscosity also revealed substantial variability ( Wang et al . , 2019 ) . Thus , large variability in cytoplasmic properties may be a fundamental , conserved property of cells . Hints from the literature suggest that heterogeneous cytoplasmic diffusion is also not limited to large protein complexes . Both larger objects such as lipid droplets ( Tolić - Nørrelykke et al . , 2004 ) and smaller particles such as individual fluorescent proteins ( Bakshi et al . , 2011 ; Baum et al . , 2014 ; Dross et al . , 2009 ; Manley et al . , 2008 ; Scipioni et al . , 2018 ; Xiang et al . , 2020 ; Yan et al . , 2020 ) seem to exhibit substantial amounts of diffusive heterogeneity . Sources of cytoplasmic heterogeneity What might be the origin of this variability in cytoplasmic properties ? Heterogeneity may originate from multiple non - exclusive sources . At the micron - scale , obstruction by organelles ( Gu et al . , 2007 ; Parkinson et al . , 2008 ) and other cytoplasmic structures such as condensates , as well as localized active mixing , could contribute to cytoplasmic variability ( Chaubet et al . , 2020 ) . At the nanometer - scale there are some enticing sources of heterogeneity that remain unexplored , notably those intrinsic to the macromolecular milieu : crowder density , size , charge , and hydrophobicity . Indeed , the fact that diffusion varies strongly with probe size and molecular species ( Arrio - Dupont et al . , 1996 , 2000 ; Banks and Fradin , 2005 ; Luby - Phelps et al . , 1986 , 1987 ; Verkman , 2002 ) , suggests that the local molecular structure of the cytoplasm plays a large role in the diffusion of macromolecules . Similarly , all - atom molecular dynamics simulations of the cytoplasm show that thermal fluctuations in the local cytoplasmic composition can lead to significant variability in diffusion rates ( Yu et al . , 2016 ) . Therefore , the molecular and cellular features contributing to viscosity may themselves be highly dynamic and transient . Future studies of diffusive heterogeneity across different species , cell types , and physiological states will be invaluable for dissecting the biophysical determinants of cytoplasmic variation . Consequences of cytoplasmic heterogeneity The heterogeneity of the cytoplasm may act as a highly significant source of biological noise for any diffusion - limited process . For example , spatial heterogeneity in diffusivity could lead to differences in diffusion - limited reaction rates across the cell . In particular , if the regions of high viscosity ( low diffusivity ) are long lived , they could act as “traps” , locally increasing the concentration of larger protein complexes or organelles , potentially influencing the speed and localization of certain reactions . The effects of stochasticity should be particularly strong for complexes which exist at low copy number or whose biological function depends on rare binding events . At the cell population level , having a wide range of diffusivities might be advantageous , allowing different cells to react to changes in the environment at different rates , permitting strategies such as bet - hedging to take place . In fact , it is hard to imagine a biological process that would not be affected by such a large variation in the effective viscosity . For example , many reactions driving gene expression , biosynthesis and metabolism are considered to be diffusion limited . For example , cytoplasmic viscosity has been demonstrated to have strong effects on microtubule dynamics in vivo ( Molines et al . , 2022 ) . Interestingly , the dynamics of individual microtubules were much less variable than those of the GEMs , suggesting that cellular systems may employ compensatory mechanisms that buffer the effects of heterogeneity in viscosity . Cellular control of viscosity and other aspects of the cytoplasm such as intracellular density represents a potential global mode of regulation . Generalization of the Doppelgӓnger simulation approach Our analyses of biological noise were made possible by using our Doppelgӓnger simulation approach . This approach explicitly reproduces the experimental measurement statistics in silico , which allowed us to definitively distinguish between statistical noise and biological heterogeneity . This simulation approach may be generalizable to many other systems ( Supp . Fig . 4 ) , and could be useful for instance in the analysis of noise suppression . Overall , we believe this powerful approach combining experiment and theory will provide needed clarity for studies of stochastic processes in biology , such as cytoskeletal dynamics , signaling , and gene expression .

The constructions of the GEMs expressing strains were described previously ( Lemière et al . , 2021 ; Molines et al . , 2022 ) . In brief , the encapsulin - mSapphire chimera was expressed under the control of the inducible nmt1 promoter ( Maundrell , 1990 ) on a multcopy pREP41X plasmid containing a leucine selection cassette . Cells were grown overnight in Edinburgh minimal medium ( EMM ) containing adenine , histidine and , uracil at 0 . 25 g per liter ( here called EMM LEU - ) and 0 . 1 µg / mL thiamine with shaking at 30 °C to exponential phase ( OD600 between 0 . 2 - 0 . 8 ) . See Table 1 for reagents and strain list . Expression of the Pyrococcus furiosus encapsulin - mSapphire construct produces particles of 40 nm in diameter , with the encapsulin proteins facing the inside of the particle and the fluorescent proteins facing the cytoplasm ( Delarue et al . , 2018 ; Szórádi et al . , 2021 ) . Microscopy S . pombe cells were imaged in commercial microchannels ( Ibidi μ - slide VI 0 . 4 slides ; Ibidi 80606 , Ibiditreat # 1 . 5 ) . Channels were pre - treated with 50 μl of 100 μg / ml lectin solution for 5 min . The lectin solution was removed by pipetting and 50 μl of cell culture were introduced then incubated for 5 to 10 minutes to allow adhesion to the lectin then cells were washed with EMM LEU - . For the 20°C condition the Ibidi slide and the buffer were equilibrated at 20°C before cells were added . For the 30°C condition , slides and buffers were equilibrated at 30°C before cells were added to it . For hyper - osmotic shocks , the medium was manually removed from the channel via pipetting and quickly replaced with pre - warmed ( 30°C ) hyper - osmotic media . Cells were imaged immediately and for no longer than 5 minutes after the medium was exchanged to minimize adaptation . For cytoskeleton depolymerization cells were introduced in the Ibidi slide as described previously then the buffer was exchanged for pre - warmed ( 30°C ) EMM LEU - containing Latrunculin A ( 8 . 4 µg / mL or 20 µM ) and methyl benzimidazol - 2 - yl - carbamate ( MBC ) ( 25 µg / mL or 131 µM ) . Cells were incubated at 30°C with the drug cocktail for 5 minutes prior to imaging . We confirmed that this treatment caused depolymerization of the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons in < 5 min by imaging cells expressing Lifeact - mCherry or GFP - Atb2 . For imaging GEMs , yeast cells were imaged with a Nikon TI - 2 equipped with a Diskovery Multi - modal imaging system from Andor and a SCMOS camera ( Andor , Ixon Ultra 888 ) using a 60x TIRF objective ( Nikon , MRD01691 ) . Cells were imaged sequentially , first a brightfield ( BF ) image then 1 , 000 fluorescence images at 100 Hz ( for ~ 10 s ) with a 488 nm excitation laser and a GFP emission filter 525 + / - 25 nm . Variable angle epifluorescence microscopy ( VAEM ) ( Konopka and Bednarek , 2008 ) was used to reduce background fluorescence and allow for the high imaging frequency required . Cells were selected for sparse numbers of labeled motile nanoparticles ( < 10 GEMs per cell ) to ensure proper particle tracking . Note that each GEM can be imaged multiple times during the acquisition giving more tracks per cell than the number of visible nanoparticles . Particle tracking Cells were individualized from the field of view by cropping the images . Images of individual cells were rotated so that cell length ( long axis ) was horizontal . From the brightfield image cell length was measured by tracing a straight line joining each pole and passing through the center of the cell . Cell contours were drawn manually from the brightfield image and used to determine cell centroid . Cell length and centroid were used to plot GEMs tracks in real and normalized space ( Figure 1 ) . GEMs nanoparticles in each cell were tracked using the MOSAIC plugin ( Fiji ImageJ ) ( Sbalzarini and Koumoutsakos , 2005 ; Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) with the following parameters for the 2D Brownian dynamics tracking in MOSAIC : radius = 3 , cutoff = 0 , per / abs = 0 . 2 - 0 . 3 , link = 1 , and displacement = 6 . Tracks shorter than 10 timepoints were removed from further analysis . Diffusivity Analysis Mean Square Displacement ( MSD ) Analysis : The MSD = < ( x ( t + τ ) - x ( t ) ) 2 > was computed using non - overlapping intervals and plotted versus time offset , τ . A linear fit of ln ( MSD ) vs ln ( τ / τ 0 ) for the first 7 time offsets ( ~ 70 ms ) was used to determine the values of the anomalous exponent and the apparent diffusivity ( see our rationale for choice of τ 0 below in this paragraph ) . As the length of the trajectories is an exponentially decaying distribution ( Fig . 1d - histograms ) , the statistical error grows with time ( Fig . 1e - MSD ) - - hence , we fit the only first part of the MSD function . The fitting resulted in two fit parameters corresponding to the equation MSD = A ( τ / τ 0 ) α , where A has units of nm 2 ( representing the MSD when τ = τ 0 ) and α is unitless . We can convert these values to an apparent diffusivity by assuming MSD τ = τ0 = A = 2nD app , τ0 τ 0 , where n is the number of spatial dimensions ( in this case , n = 2 ) . Solving for the apparent diffusivity D app in nm 2 ms - 1 , we find the following conversion : D app , τ0 = A / ( 2nτ 0 ) ( representing the apparent diffusivity specifically at τ 0 ) . We choose τ 0 = 100ms , to represent the intermediate regime measured in our dataset . For track - wise fits , the time - averaged MSD was calculated and fit separately for each trajectory . For cell - wise and condition - wise MSD calculations , the time - averaged MSDs for each track were then ensemble - averaged over all tracks in each cell or condition , respectively , and subsequently fit . Doppelganger Simulations Simulations of particle diffusion were implemented using fixed time step Brownian dynamics , according to the Stokes - Einstein relation for diffusion of a spherical particle in a viscous medium ( D = k B T / γ , where D is the diffusion coefficient such that the mean - squared displacement MSD = 2nDt is linear with time t and the number of dimensions n , k B is the Boltzmann constant , T is the temperature , and γ = 6πηR , where η is the viscosity of the cytoplasm and R is the radius of the particle ) . See Table 2 for a list of the parameters used . All code was written in custom MATLAB scripts . Cells were implemented as 2D rectangular boxes with reflecting boundary conditions at the edges of each box . All simulated cells had a short - axis width of 3 μm , and a long - axis width equal to that of it’s experimentally - measured doppelgӓnger . ( Note that the short - axis width was chosen to be 3 μm , rather than the known 4 μm diameter of fission yeast cells , to best represent the imaging conditions in the experimental data . VAEM imaging only captures the lower portion of the cell near the coverslip , where the cross - section is smaller than at the equatorial plane . ) Each simulated cell had the same number of particles as its experimental doppelgänger . Each particle was initialized randomly within the rectangular cell wall boundary . After initialization , particle positions were updated using fixed time step Brownian dynamics , where the fixed time step , Δt , was equal to the acquisition frame rate of the experimental measurements . In each time step , a random number generator ( randn , seeded randomly at the beginning of each set of simulations with rng ( ' shuffle ' ) ) selected each particle’s step size and direction from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of ξ = sqrt ( 2 * k B T * γ / Δt ) . If a particle left the cell boundary during a timestep , the particle’s position was reflected across the cell boundary ( or boundaries ) that the particle crossed , in order to keep the particle inside the cell ( i . e . , reflective boundary conditions ) . For ease of implementation , all particle tracks were simulated for the longest length of time any particle in the experimental dataset was tracked ; then after simulations were complete , each simulated particle’s data were pruned to match their experimental doppelgӓnger - - all other timepoints that were not tracked for the experimental doppelgӓnger were deleted from the simulated dataset . For simulations with cell - cell variations in viscosity ( Models # 3 and # 4 ) , viscosity values for each cell were chosen from a random log - normal distribution ( η = μe ( σ / μ ) * randn ( ) ) , with a mean viscosity equal to 40 times that of water , and a standard deviation of 45 % of the mean . For simulations with spatially - varying viscosity ( Models # 2 and # 4 ) , each rectangular cell was broken up into spatial domains of equally - sized squares with 1 μm side - length . As all cells were 3 μm in width but variable in length , simulated spatial domains within cells were arranged in a 3xm grid , where m is the number of domains along the long axis . If the cell length along the long dimension was not an integer multiple of 1 μm , then the remainder was placed in its own spatial domain of smaller size . Viscosity values in each domain were chosen from a random log - normal distribution ( η = μe ( σ / μ ) * randn ( ) ) , with a mean equal to the mean viscosity of that cell , and a standard deviation equal to 85 % of the mean . Statistical analysis Velocity autocorrelation analysis : Velocity autocorrelations were defined as VAC ( τ ) = < ( v ( t + τ ) v ( t ) ) > t and were performed using non - overlapping intervals . ANOVA : A nested , n - way analysis of variance was performed using MATLAB’s anovan ( ) function . Track identity was nested under cell , session , and day identities , cell identity was nested under session and day identities , and the session identity was nested under the day identity . ANOVA was performed separately on the power law exponents and the natural logarithm of the diffusivities . ANOVA was performed identically on the experimental and simulated datasets . Because the Doppelgӓnger simulation approach computationally reproduces the exact experimental distribution of tracks , cells , sessions , and days , the exact magnitudes of the variance attributed to each category can be directly quantitatively compared ( e . g . Figure 3f ) . Comparison of median diffusivity values between conditions : A Wilcoxson rank sum non - parametric test for equality of medians ( Mann and Whitney , 1947 ) was performed to determine whether differences in the medians between conditions were statistically significant . We chose a non - parametric test , and compared the medians instead of the means , so that our analysis would be less sensitive to the fact that the distributions were long - tailed and not perfectly Gaussian ( even in log space ) . Statistical tests were performed on the logarithm ( base 10 ) of the apparent diffusivities . Comparison of variance in diffusivity values between conditions : Levene’s test for equality of variance ( Levene , 1960 ) was performed to determine whether differences in the variances between conditions were statistically significant . While Levene’s test is not a non - parametric test , it is less sensitive to non - normality than many other parametric tests , and is MATLAB’s recommended test for equality of variance for non - normal distributions . Statistical tests were performed on the logarithm ( base 10 ) of the apparent diffusivities . Converting summary statistics from log space to real space : Because the diffusivities were more normally distributed in log space than in real space , all of the summary statistics ( medians , standard deviations , etc . ) were calculated on the distribution in log space . For a distribution that is log - normally distributed , medians and standard deviations calculated in log space are not the same as those calculated in real space and so are not interchangeable ( i . e . 10 < a > = / = < 10 a > , and 10 sqrt ( < ( a - < a > ) ^ 2 > ) = / = sqrt ( < ( 10 a - < 10 a > ) 2 > ) and have different interpretations . The median of the log - scale diffusivity distribution ( μ log = < log 10 ( D app , 100ms ) > represents the median order of magnitude of diffusivities in the dataset . The medians reported in this work were first calculated from the distribution in log space , and then converted to real space as μ real = 10 μ _ log , and also represents the median order of magnitude ( but now presented in real space ) . The standard deviation of the log - scale diffusivity distribution ( σ = sqrt ( < ( log 10 ( D app , 100ms ) - < log 10 ( D app , 100ms ) > ) ^ 2 > ) represents the number of orders of magnitude spanned by the dataset ) . In real space , the associated number which best captures the data’s span in order of magnitudes is the fold - range of the distribution measured at some specified number of standard deviations away from the mean . In our dataset , a 2 . 5σ threshold best matched the outlier exclusion algorithm used in our box - plotting software ( 1 . 5 times the interquartile range past the 25th and 75th percentiles , Fig . 2c , see caption ) . To determine the fold - range , the standard deviation was calculated for the diffusivity distribution in log space , then the ratio of the diffusivities at 10 ( μ _ log±2 . 5 * σ _ log ) ( i . e . , the fold - range ) was evaluated as 10 ( μ + 2 . 5 * σ ) / 10 ( μ - 2 . 5 * σ ) = 10 5 * σ . In perturbation conditions ( Fig . 4 ) , the reported percent change in the median and fold - range were de Table 2 : Model Parameters - Input parameters Variable Meaning Value Source k B Boltzmann’s constant 0 . 0138pN nm / K - T Cytoplasm temperature 303 . 15 K ( 30 °C ) This work R Particle radius 20 nm ( Delarue et al . , 2018 ) L Cell length That of the experimentally - measured counterpart This work W Cell width 3 μm This work η w Dynamic viscosity of water 2 . 414×10 - 8 ×10 ( 247 . 8 / ( T - 140 ) ) ( 8×10 - 7 pN ms / nm 2 at 30 °C ) - 〈 η c , s 〉 Dynamic viscosity of the cytoplasm ( mean across all cells and subcellular spatial domains ) 40 η w ( 320×10 - 7 pN ms / nm 2 at 30 °C ) Approximated to match experimentally - measured average diffusivity assuming the Stokes - Einstein relationship D = k B T / γ σ η , c Standard deviation of the average cellular viscosity across all cells in the population 0 . 45 〈 η c , s 〉 Best fit to this work σ η , s Standard deviation of the viscosity among all spatial domains in a cell 0 . 85 〈 η c 〉 where 〈 η c 〉 is the average across all spatial domains in a particular cell Best fit to this work λ Spatial domain size within a single cell 1 μm Best fit to this work Table 3 : Model Parameters - Derived parameters Variable Meaning Value k B T Thermal energy 4 . 18 pN nm 〈 γ 〉 Viscous drag coefficient given Stokes’ law ( for the average particle ) γ = 6π 〈 η c 〉 R 0 . 012 pN ms / nm ( at 30 °C ) 〈 D c , s 〉 Diffusivity ( averaged across all cells and spatial domains ) D = k B T / γ 350 nm 2 / ms Data and code availability All raw imaging data are available upon request .

Supplementary Figures Figure S1 : Experimental data is consistent with nearly unconstrained diffusion . ( a ) Mean - squared displacement ( MSD ) along the long and short axes of the cell , plotted alongside the total MSD . ( b ) The predicted MSD for Fractional Brownian motion ( FBM ) , including both analytical theory and results from simulated data , using the experimentally - measured values of D and α . The experimental data is also plotted for comparison , showing good agreement with the theory . ( a - b ) Note the logarithmic scale along the x - and y - axes . ( c ) The predicted velocity autocorrelation for FBM , showing the characteristic negative peak which then decays to zero . Experimental data shows a wide and very shallow negative basin , which does not match the shape or depth of the peak predicted by FBM . Figure S2 : Additional evidence for intrinsic and extrinsic sources of noise . ( a ) The relationship between the apparent diffusivity and power law exponent . ( b ) The apparent diffusivity of each particle in the dataset plotted against a randomly chosen particle from the same cell . Each particle is represented exactly once in the plot . For cells with an odd number of particles , one particle would not be represented for that cell . ( c ) Mean diffusivity across tracks in each cell plotted vs the number of tracks in each cell . ( d ) Coefficient of variation across tracks in each cell plotted vs the number of tracks in each cell . ( e ) Coefficient of variation vs mean diffusivity calculated by averaging across all tracks for each cell . ( a - e ) Fits of track - wise MSD data are shown in light blue , with cell - wise fits overlaid in dark blue . ( a - b ) Note the logarithmic scale along the y - axis . ( b ) Note the logarithmic scale along the x - axis . ( b - d ) r - and p - values determined by a Spearman correlation algorithm . Figure S3 : The large heterogeneity in diffusivity cannot be explained by the cell cycle or subcellular GEM particle localization . ( a - b ) Fitted values for diffusivity ( a ) and power law exponent ( b ) plotted as a function of cell length . ( c - d ) Track - wise fit values for diffusivity ( c ) and power law exponent ( d ) plotted against the mean ( time - averaged ) particle position along the long axis of the cell . There are fewer cells and tracks represented in ( c - e ) compared to ( a - b ) because the new pole could be distinguished from the old pole for only a subset of cells . ( a - d ) Fits of track - wise MSD data are shown in light blue , with cell - wise fits overlaid in dark blue . ( a , c ) Note the logarithmic scale along the y - axis .
