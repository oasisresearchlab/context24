During malignant progression , the cytoskeleton is strongly altered . Hence we analyzed if expression of certain cytoskeleton - associated proteins is correlated with clinical outcome of ovarian cancer patients . Methods First , in silico analysis was performed using the cancer genome atlas ( TCGA ) , the human expression atlas and Pubmed . Selected candidates were validated on 270 ovarian cancer patients by qRT - PCR and / or by western blotting . Results In silico analysis revealed that mRNAs of 214 cytoskeleton - associated proteins are detectable in ovarian cancer tissue . Among these , we selected 17 proteins that participate in cancer disease progression and cytoskeleton modulation : KIF14 , KIF20A , KIF18A , ASPM , CEP55 , DLGAP5 , MAP9 , EB1 , KATNA1 , DIAPH1 , ANLN , SCIN , CCDC88A , FSCN1 , GSN , VASP and CDC42 . The first ten candidates interact with microtubules ( MTs ) and the others bind to actin filaments . Validation on clinical samples of ovarian cancer patients revealed that the expression levels of DIAPH1 , EB1 , KATNA1 , KIF14 and KIF18A significantly correlated with clinical and histological parameters of ovarian cancer . High DIAPH1 , EB1 , KATNA1 and KIF14 protein levels were associated with increased overall survival ( OAS ) of ovarian cancer patients , while high DIAPH1 and EB1 protein levels were also associated with low differentiation of respective tumors ( G2 / 3 ) . Moreover , DIAPH1 was the only protein , whose expression significantly correlated with increased recurrence - free interval ( RFI ) . Conclusion Mainly the expression levels of the MT - associated proteins analyzed in this study , correlated with prolonged survival of ovarian cancer patients . From > 200 genes initially considered , 17 cytoskeletal proteins are involved in cancer progression according to the literature . Among these , four proteins significantly correlated with improved survival of ovar - ian cancer patients . Keywords Ovarian cancer · Microtubule · Actin · Cytoskeleton Introduction Ovarian carcinoma ( OvCa ) is generally diagnosed at an advanced stage when intraperitoneal tumor cell dissemina - tion has already taken place . Up to now , therapy is based on surgical reduction of the tumor masses ( debulking ) followed by paclitaxel and platinum - based combination chemother - apy . In spite of intensive research , there are no established molecular prognostic or predictive markers for this cancer type , and new molecular targets for an individualized ther - apy are urgently needed . Ovarian cancer cells mainly metastasize within the peri - toneal cavity , but the molecular mechanisms underlying this metastatic cascade are still far from being understood .

Thus , the mechanism of ovarian cancer cell metastasis differs from that of hema - togenous metastasis . However , in case of both hematoge - nous - and peritoneal metastasis tumor cells escape from the primary tumor and form new cell colonies at distant sites . To facilitate these processes the tumor cell cytoskeleton must be highly flexible to enable cell migration and attach - ment . Studies on ovarian cancer cell lines revealed that well - differentiated immortalized epithelial normal ovarian cells showed a stiff , stress - fiber - rich actin cytoskeleton . In malig - nant ovarian cancer cells , in contrast , formation of actin stress fibers was strongly reduced and F - actin accumulated at cortical regions , resulting in a more extended phenotype ( Xu et al . 2012 ) . This finding was confirmed by a mouse model used to analyze neoplastic progression of ovarian cells . It could be shown that formation of actin stress fibers , again decreased with increasing malignancy of ovarian can - cer cells ( Creekmore et al . 2011 ) . Accordingly , expression of proteins increasing the formation of F - actin or F - actin bundles , such as fascin or formins , was down - regulated in malignant ovarian cancer cells , while expression of the F - actin severing protein gelsolin was up - regulated ( Creek - more et al . 2011 ) . In addition to actin , microtubules are also important components of the cell´s cytoskeleton . Hence reg - ulation of microtubule ( MTs ) dynamics additionally plays an essential role in ovarian cancer progression . The spin - dle apparatus consists of fibers made of microtubules and associated proteins and cellular transport processes depend on the formation of MTs , which are considered to be the “highways of the cell” ( Akhmanova and Steinmetz 2015 ) . Since taxol - based chemotherapeutics ( including paclitaxel ) inhibit MTs dynamics paclitaxel treatment of ovarian cancer patients inhibits proliferation of fast growing ovarian cancers by preventing movement of spindle MTs to the cell poles and blocks cellular vesicle transport . However , most of the ovarian cancer cell populations develop resistances against paclitaxel after first line therapy , mostly consisting of pacli - taxel and carboplatin . There are multiple mechanism mediat - ing taxol - resistance , among which MT - associated proteins decrease or increase binding of taxol to MTs ( Orr et al . 2003 ) . These data , showing the relevance of cell cytoskeletal dynamics for disease and resistance progression of ovarian carcinoma , led us to analyze whether the expression levels of certain cytoskeleton - associated proteins might correlate with the clinical outcome of ovarian cancer patients . For this approach , database analysis ( the cancer genome atlas ( TCGA ) , the human protein atlas , PubMed ) was performed and the relevance of selected genes for disease progression was analyzed by real time PCR and / or by western blotting using samples from ovarian cancer patients . Materials and methods Database research To reveal which cytoskeleton associated proteins are expressed in ovarian cancer , mRNA expression level data from the TCGA - OV project were investigated . Data were downloaded from the genomic data commons ( GDC ) data portal and expression levels were compared to those of normal uterus tissue . Differential expression of genes were evaluated by FDR corrected two - sample t test and the most significant genes with the highest fold change were selected ( Matlab , Bioinformatics Toolbox , version R2017a , MathWorks ® ) . By this method , we also obtained proteins which were only indirectly associated with the cytoskeleton because they were involved in the regulation of signal transduction path - ways controlling certain cytoskeleton associated proteins or were involved in their gene , mRNA or protein regula - tion . These kind of proteins were not selected . Instead , we selected proteins which directly interact with actin or MTs . In addition , proteins of the RhoGTPase family were selected because these G - proteins directly interact with cytoskeleton associated proteins . These genes were further selected for genes which were only weakly expressed in normal tissue ( data base research by “The Human Protein Atlas” ) . To evaluate the involvement of selected cytoskeleton associ - ated proteins in cancer disease progression a PubMed ( https : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / pubme d / ) search was conducted . Patients In this study , patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and primary surgery at the University Medical Centre Ham - burg between 1997 and 2014 were included . For analyses at mRNA level , material from 68 patients with epithelial ovar - ian cancer , 20 patients with borderline and 2 patients with cystadenoma , respectively , was examined . For analyses at protein level , material from 164 patients with epithelial ovar - ian cancer , 12 patients with borderline and 4 patients with cystadenoma , respectively , was analyzed . The median fol - low - up time was 21 months . Clinical outcome of all patients was followed from date of surgery until June 2015 . Detailed patient characteristics are listed in supplementary table 1 . Tissue samples and protein / RNA extraction The tissue samples were intraoperatively collected and immediately cryoconserved at − 80 °C . To assure a tumor cell content of at least 60 % , every sample was assessed on cryocut hematoxylin - eosin - stained sections . For protein and RNA extraction , approximately 20 – 30 cryosections of tumor 2197 Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology ( 2018 ) 144 : 2195 – 2205 1 3 tissue ( ca . 20 µm thick ) were homogenized in 600 µl RIPA buffer solution ( containing protease and phosphatase inhibi - tors ; Sigma , Taufkirchen , Germany ) or RLT buffer solution ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) , using the Precellys - 24 Homog - enisator ( Peqlab , VWR International GmbH , Erlangen , Ger - many ) for 2 × 45 s at 200 rpm . Protein lysates were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 10 , 000× g for 10 min . Supernatants were subject to protein concentration deter - mination using BCA system ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , IL , USA ) following the supplier’s protocol . RNA extraction was performed from RLT lysates using an RNeasy Kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) . RNA concentration was determined pho - tometrically using Nanodrop ( Peqlab , VWR International GmbH , Erlangen , Germany ) , and RNA quality was assessed by electrophoresis on a denaturing agarose gel . Western blot analysis Western blot analysis was performed by a standard pro - tocol . Briefly , equal amounts of protein ( 20 µg ) of each sample were loaded per lane . Protein lysates from the ovar - ian cancer cell line OVCAR - 8 and the breast cancer cell line MDA - MB - 231 were used as a reference and internal control in all blots . After electrophoresis and blotting to polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF ) membranes , following proteins were detected : anti - KIF20A ( 1 : 1000 ; ab104118 , Abcam plc , Cambridge , UK ) , anti - KIF14 ( 1 : 5000 ; ab3747 ) , anti - KIF18A ( 1 : 4000 ; ab 72415 ) , anti - β - Actin ( 1 : 2000 ; A1978 , Sigma , St . Louis , MO , USA ) , anti - HSC70 ( 1 : 6000 , sc - 7298 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc . , TX , USA ) , anti - Fascin1 ( 1 : 1000 ; sc - 21743 ) , anti - VASP ( 1 : 1000 ; sc - 4668 ) , anti - KATNA1 ( 1 : 1000 ; ab111881 ) , anti - CDC42 ( 1 : 1000 ; BD610928 , Becton Dickinson GmbH , Heidelberg , Ger - many ) , anti - EB1 ( 1 : 1000 ; # 2167 ; Cell Signaling Technol - ogy Europe ) , anti - DIAPH1 ( 1 : 5000 ; ab11173 ) and anti - Gel - solin ( 1 : 5000 ; ab113229 ) . For detection , membranes were blocked 1 h at room temperature with 5 % milk powder in Tris - buffered saline and Tween 20 ( TBST ) and subsequently incubated with the antibody in 5 % milk / TBST solution over - night at 4 °C . Secondary antibodies against mouse ( 1 : 10000 ; ab205719 ) or rabbit ( 1 : 10000 ; ab205718 ) were diluted in TBST and incubation was performed for 1 h at room tem - perature . After visualization by chemiluminescence reagent ( Amersham ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Rea - gent , GE Healthcare Bio - Sciences , Pittsburgh , USA ) and ImageQuant LAS 4000 ( GE Healthcare Bio - Sciences ) , band intensities were quantified by ImageJ and calculated as per - cent intensity of the specific control sample . qRT‑PCR For RNA extraction the Transcriptor First Strand Synthese Kit ( Roche ) was used , 5 µg RNA was reverse transcribed . Quantitative RT - PCR analysis was carried out with 1 µl from a 1 : 5 dilution of the synthetized cDNA on the Light Cycler 96 System ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) using the Master - mix ORA TM qPCR Green ROX H Mix ( highQu ) . Samples were analyzed in duplicate and averaged using the Light Cycler Software 1 . 1 ( Roche ) . Data were analyzed based on the ΔΔCt method using OVCAR - 8 cells as a reference sample . Reference samples were chosen based on compa - rable expression levels to those found in the tumor sam - ples . All primers ( supplementary table 1 ) were design to amplify products between 150 and 250 bp , and when pos - sible , exon spanning primers were used to avoid genomic DNA amplification . Immunohistochemistry For analysis of DIAPH1 expression the paraffin - embed - ded , 5 µm sliced samples were deparaffinized and antigen retrieval was performed with citrate buffer , pH 6 in a steamer at 100 °C for 20 min . The primary rabbit polyclonal anti - DAIPH1 antibody from abcam ( ab11173 , 1 mg / mL ) was diluted 1 : 150 and the samples were incubated at RT for 1 h and thereafter incubated with the secondary swine - anti - rab - bit - biotin - conjugated antibody for 30 min at RT . The avidin / biotin alkaline phosphatase enzyme complex and Permanent Red ( Dako ) were applied for 20 min at RT to visualize the DIAPH1 level . The nuclei were counterstained with Mayer’s Hemalum solution 5 – 10 s . To analyze the EB1 level in tumor cells , the same protocol was used with two exceptions : The samples were incubated in a steamer at 121 °C for 10 min ( in citrate buffer , pH6 ) and the primary antibody was a rabbit polyclonal anti - EB1 from abcam ( # ab117821 , 1 mg / mL ) , diluted 1 : 100 . Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences 22 . 0 ( SPSS ) program ( SPSS Inc . Chicago , IL , USA ) , with a Chi - square test for corre - lations between mRNA expression level and clinical and histopathologic parameters . The mean mRNA and protein levels of each protein were compared between ovarian car - cinoma and borderline samples using t test . For further sta - tistical analysis on protein expression levels , the cohorts were divided into quartiles according to their expression values , and Kaplan Meier analyses with log - rank tests were performed with the most suitable cut - off . A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to examine simultaneously the effects of multiple covariates on survival including nodal involvement , FIGO , grading and residual tumor after surgery . Chi square tests using the groups given above were used to examine associations with 2198 Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology ( 2018 ) 144 : 2195 – 2205 1 3 clinicopathologic factors ( FIGO stage , grading , pT - and pN - stage ) . Correlations between the expression profiles of selected proteins were examined using two - sided Spearman tests . Probability value ( p value ) ≤ 0 . 05 was considered sta - tistically significant . Results Identification of cytoskeleton associated proteins with potential clinical relevance in ovarian cancer Our aim was to analyze if cytoskeleton associated pro - teins play a role in the clinical outcome of ovarian cancer patients . For this purpose , we first analyzed the TCGA data base for mRNA levels of cytoskeleton associated proteins . From the 1468 genes included in the database , we identi - fied 214 genes , which were directly associated with the cytoskeleton . These genes were further selected for genes which were only weakly expressed in normal tissue ( data base research by “The Human Protein Atlas” ) . In addition , these genes should have been described in the literature ( PubMed ) to be involved in cancer progression . By con - sidering these criteria , ten cytoskeleton associated proteins were selected : Kinesin Family Member 14 ( KIF14 ) , Kine - sin Family Member 20A ( KIF20A ) , Kinesin Family Mem - ber 18A ( KIF18A ) , Abnormal Spindle Protein Homolog ( ASPM ) , Centrosomal Protein 55 ( CEP55 ) , Disks large - associated protein 5 ( DLGAP5 or HURP ) , Microtubule Associated Protein 9 ( MAP9 ) , anillin ( ANLN ) , scinderin ( SCIN ) and girdin ( CCDC88A ) The first seven proteins are microtubule ( MT ) - associated proteins , involved in attach - ment of spindle MTs to chromosomes , and the last three proteins belong to the group of actin - associated proteins . Anillin binds F - actin and is involved in the regulation of cytokinesis , scinderin is an actin severing protein belong - ing to the gelsolin family and girding is an actin bundling protein ( Wang et al . 2016 ; Stangel et al . 2015 ; Zhang et al . 2010 ; Brüning - Richardson et al . 2011 ; Inoda et al . 2009 ; Chen et al . 2014 ; Rouquier et al . 2014 ; Idichi et al . 2017 ; Liu et al . 2016 ; Choi et al . 2017 ) . In addition , independent of bioinformatics analysis , five additional cytoskeleton associated proteins were cho - sen known to be involved in progression of other tumor types , including , cdc42 ( a RhoGTPase ) protein diapha - nous homolog 1 ( DIAPH1 : nucleates actin and stabilizes MTs ) , katanin1 ( KATNA1 : severs MTs ) , end binding 1 ( EB1 : stabilizes MTs ) VASP and fascin ( bundle F - actin ) ( Arias - Romero and Chernoff 2013 ; Lin et al . 2015 ; Fu et al . 2018 ; Dong et al . 2010 ; Pula and Krause 2008 ; Heinz et al . 2017 ) . Correlation of mRNA levels of cytoskeleton associated proteins with clinical and histological parameters of ovarian cancer patients To validate if the mRNA level of cytoskeleton - associated proteins selected from the data base searches correlates with clinical outcome and / or histological parameters of ovarian cancer patients , we analyzed mRNA levels of 90 tumor samples by qRT - PCR ( supplementary table 2 ) . Among these , 20 or 2 samples were from well - differenti - ated borderline or cystadenomas , respectively , and 68 from malignant ovarian cancer . First , we examined whether the mRNA level of the cytoskeleton - associated proteins was higher in samples from malignant ovarian cancer than in borderline or cystadenomas . We found that this was true for KIF14 , KIF20A , KIF18A , CEP55 , DLGAP5 and ASPM ( Table 1 ) . Therefore , we further analyzed if the mRNA level of these proteins correlated with clinical and histological parameters including clinical stage , grading , lymph node involvement and overall survival . Thereby , the cohort was divided in two equal groups according to the mRNA level : In group 1 ( marked in blue ) the mRNA levels were lower than the median mRNA level ( < median ) and in group 2 ( marked in green ) the mRNA level were higher than the median ( > median ) . Correlation analysis revealed a significant correlation between high mRNA levels of KIF20A , KIF18A , DLGAP5 and CEP55 and high - grading status ( G2 / 3 ) . The mRNA level of KIF14 did show a simi - lar tendency , but no significant correlation ( Fig . 1 ) . In summary , our data revealed that the mRNA levels of five different cytoskeleton associated proteins were higher in ovarian cancers as compared to borderline tumors . Among these , the mRNA levels of four cytoskeleton asso - ciated proteins ( KIF20A , KIF18A , DLGAP and CEP55 ) Table 1 Expression of cytoskeleton associated proteins in ovarian carcinomas as compared to borderline tumors and cystadenomas Gene Diagnosis Average mRNA - level p value ( t test ) KIF14 Borderline 0 . 243 0 . 004 * OvCa 0 . 691 KIF20A Borderline 0 . 088 < 0 . 0005 * OvCa 0 . 275 KIF18A Borderline 0 . 418 < 0 . 0005 * OvCa 0 . 849 CEP55 Borderline 0 . 191 < 0 . 0005 * OvCa 0 . 507 DLGAP5 Borderline 0 . 071 < 0 . 0005 * OvCa 0 . 188 ASPM Borderline 0 . 160 0 . 019 * OvCa 0 . 348 2199 Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology ( 2018 ) 144 : 2195 – 2205 1 3 significantly correlated with poor differentiation and KIF14 showed a tendency pointing in the same direction . High levels of microtubule ( MT ) ‑associated proteins are correlated with clinical parameters of ovarian cancer Based on our qRT - PCR results , we selected KIF20A and KIF18A , for validation by Western blotting . We also included KIF14 because Thériault et al . ( 2012 ) found that a high KIF14 mRNA concentration predicts poor outcome of ovarian cancer patients . In addition , the protein levels of KATNA1 , DIAPH1 , VASP , EB1 , fascin , gelsolin and cdc42 were analyzed by western blotting because these proteins have been shown to be essential for progression of other cancer types ( see above ) . The patient cohort used for this analysis included 164 primary ovarian carcinomas , 10 borderline tumors and 4 cystadenomas ( Supplementary table 2 ) . We quantified the signals and normalized them to an internal control ( MDA - MB - 231 or OVCAR - 8 cells ) as well as to a load - ing control ( actin ) . Significantly higher KIF18A , VASP and EB1 expression was found in ovarian cancer sam - ples as compared to borderline tumors ( p < 0 . 001 ) and DIAPH1 showed a tendency pointing in the same direction ( p = 0 . 057 ) ( Data not shown ) . Within the group of primary ovarian carcinoma sam - ples , we first analyzed the pairwise correlation between the protein levels of KIF14 , KIF18A , KIF20A , fascin , VASP , KATNA1 , cdc42 , EB1 , gelsolin or DIAPH1 with clini - cal stage ( FIGO ) , grading ( G ) , lymph node involvement , residual tumor after surgery , overall survival ( OAS ) and recurrence - free interval ( RFI ) . We found a significant correlation of high KIF18A expression with late stages ( FIGO IIIC - IV ) . Regarding tumor grading , significantly higher KIF18A , EB1 and DIAPH1 levels were detected in poorly differentiated tumors ( G3 ) and a similar trend was observed for KIF14 ( p = 0 . 051 ) . No significant associations with residual tumor after surgery or nodal involvement was noted for any of the analyzed proteins ( Table 2 ) . Kaplan – Meier analysis ( Fig . 2 ) revealed a significant association of high KATNA1 , KIF14 , DIAPH1 and EB1 expression levels with a longer overall survival ( p = 0 . 015 , p = 0 . 003 , p = 0 . 004 and p = 0 . 016 ) . For DIAPH1 we found additionally a significant association with a longer recurrence - free interval ( p = 0 . 013 ) . In multivari - ate Cox regression analysis including clinical stage and residual tumor after surgery , KIF14 , KATNA1 , EB1 and DIAPH1 remained prognostic indicators for overall sur - vival ( p = 0 . 001 , p = 0 . 047 , p = 0 . 026 and p = 0 . 007 ) , and DIAPH1 for recurrence - free survival as well ( p = 0 . 005 ) ( Table 3 ) . In summary , our data revealed that KIF14 , KIF18A , EB1 , DIAPH1 and KATNA1 protein levels significantly corre - lated with clinical parameters of ovarian cancer patients . Fig . 1 High mRNA levels of MT - associated proteins are associated with poor differentia - tion . mRNA was prepared from fresh frozen patient material of 90 ovarian cancer patients and subscribed in cDNA .

To vali - date that EB1 and DIAPH1 are mainly expressed in cancer and not in stroma cells we performed immunohistochemistry with selected formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded G3 - tumor samples ( n = 7 ) that exhibited different EB1 and DIAPH1 protein levels in western blot ( Fig . 3 ) . This analysis revealed that EB1 and DIAPH1 are mainly expressed in tumor and only weakly in stroma cells . Discussion In this study we analyzed whether the expression of cytoskeleton associated proteins in tumor tissue is associ - ated with clinical outcome of patients suffering from ovarian cancer . We selected candidate genes after detailed database research and found that from 214 cytoskeleton associated proteins selected , five proteins ( KIF14 , KIF18A , KATNA1 , EB1 , and DIAPH1 ) significantly correlated with clinical and / or histological parameters of ovarian cancer patients . KIF14 and KIF18A belong to the mitotic kinesins ; they are essentially involved in the control of spindle MTs dur - ing attachment to chromosomes and movement to the cell poles . In addition , the kinesins are essential for cytokinesis by regulating MT - dynamics in midbodies . Based on these essential roles for cellular division , up - regulated expression of the kinesins correlates with bad clinical outcome in sev - eral tumor types ( Rath and Kozielski 2012 ) . The p60 subunit of KATNA1 severs MTs and is conserved located at spindle poles and midbodies , where , similar as the mitotic kinesins , it controls MT - dynamics ( Matsuo et al . 2013 ) . In breast can - cer KATNA1 was found to be up - regulated in bone metas - tasis as compared to the primary tumor and its down - reg - ulation inhibited migration of breast cancer cells ( Fu et al . 2018 ) . EB1 binds to the plus end of MTs ( + TIP protein ) where it recruits further + TIP proteins promoting growth of MTs . Based on this important activity , EB1 is essential for many MT - dependent cellular processes , including spindle dynamics , vesicle trafficking and regulation of cell morphol - ogy ( Nehlig et al . 2017 ) . Dong et al . revealed an oncogenic activity of EB1 in breast cancer cells and demonstrated that the level of EB1 correlates with clinicopathological param - eters . DIAPH1 directly binds to MTs in vitro and in cells it associates as EB1 and APC - containing complex to MTs , resulting in stabilization of MTs plus ends ( Wen et al . 2004 ) . Thus , EB1 and DIAPH1 are functionally coupled . Our group found that DIAPH1 is essential for metastasis of colorectal cancer cells by controlling cellular adhesion through sta - bilizing MTs ( Lin et al . 2015 ) . In addition , to regulating Fig . 3 Validation of DIAPH1 and EB1 expression in tumor cells by immunohistochemistry . Two of the most interesting hits of our screen , DIAPH1 and EB1 were validated by immunohistochemistry to show that the genes are expressed mainly in tumor as compared to stroma cells . Left panels show positive or negative control . Right panel show tumor samples exhibiting different levels of EB1 or DIAPH1 . Bars : 100 µm 2203 Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology ( 2018 ) 144 : 2195 – 2205 1 3 MT - dynamics , DIAPH1 nucleates actin , thus controls the formation of cellular protrusions essential for invasion of cancer cells ( Poincloux et al . 2009 ) . Interestingly , although we initially analyzed both , actin ( girdin , annilin , scinderin , fascin , VASP and DIAPH1 ) and MT - associated ( KATNA1 , KIF14 , KIF18A , EB1 and DIAPH1 ) proteins , only expression of MT - associated pro - teins correlated with clinical outcome of ovarian patients . The only exception was DIAPH1 which controls both , actin and MT - dynamics . Thus , it seems that regulation of MT - dynamics is more important for disease progression of ovar - ian cancer than regulation of actin dynamics . This assump - tion can be explained by the mechanism of ovarian cancer metastasis , which is different from most other cancer types . Ovarian cancer cells mainly metastasize non - hematogenous , and therefore , are not dependent on the formation of inva - dopodia to invade the blood vessels ( Tan et al . 2006 ) . Thus , expression of actin bundling proteins ( i . e . , fascin , VASP or girdin ) , which are essential for formation of these cellular protrusion , is not absolutely required for formation of ovar - ian cancer cell metastasis . Further , ovarian carcinomas are rapidly proliferating tumors and on the other hand the tumor cell spheroids arising from the primary tumor are highly adhesive . Both processes , cellular proliferation and adhe - sion are dependent on functional MT - dynamics controlling spindle dynamics and transport of adhesion molecules to the plasma membrane ( Akhmanova and Steinmetz 2015 ) . One would expect that high expression of MT - associ - ated proteins might correlate with decreased survival , but the opposite was the fact in our study : high expression of KATNA1 , KIF14 , DIAPH1 and EB1 , all factors involved in the regulation of spindle dynamics ( Jiang et al . 2017 ; She et al . 2017 ; Zhang et al . 2015 ; Almada et al . 2017 ) were associated with increased overall survival . We assume that increased survival of patients suffering from ovarian cancer with high KATNA1 , KIF14 , DIAPH1 or EB1 levels might result from an increased response to chemotherapeutics . Ovarian cancer patients are generally treated with carbopl - atin and paclitaxel , both cytotoxic drugs that preferentially target highly proliferative cells . Since KATNA1 , KIF14 , DIAPH1 and EB1 promote cellular division ; we assume that tumors with high levels of these MT - proteins might respond better to the therapy , whereas slowly growing tumor cells could survive platinum - paclitaxel therapy , thereby contribut - ing to a poorer outcome . In line with this hypothesis , Kondoh et al . described a poorer disease - free and overall survival for patients with a low proliferation index , measured by Ki67 staining . In addi - tion , Chen et al . recently reported that low Ki67 expression ( < 40 % ) in ovarian high - grade serous carcinoma is signifi - cantly associated with platinum resistance and decreased survival . Thus , slowly proliferating cancer cells are likely to be resistant to conventional chemotherapy . Also a study of the AGO study group ( Grabowski et al . 2016 ) including 5114 patients showed that primary low - grade serous ovarian cancer ( LGSOC ) is not as responsive to platinum - taxane - based chemotherapy as high - grade serous advanced ovar - ian cancer . They revealed that the currently recommended platinum - taxane - chemotherapy showed limited activity in approximately one from four LGSOC patients only . Surprisingly , KATNA , KIF14 and EB1 expression sig - nificantly impacted OS rates but did not affect RFI ( see Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Here , the follow - up care of most patients comprised in our study did not include periodic imaging tests and close monitoring of CA - 125 levels , so that the recurrence time point ( RFI ) represents a much less reliable end point than OS in our cohort . Thus , to validate the hypothesis that high expression of the MT - associated proteins KATNA , KIF14 , DIAPH1 and EB1 affect chemo - therapy response , further experimental studies are planned to prove the specific effects of the MT - associated proteins on ovarian cancer cell chemosensitivity against taxanes and DNA - damaging substances . Conclusions In summary , our data show that high expression of KATNA1 , KIF14 , DIAPH1 and EB1 correlates with increased survival of ovarian cancer patients , most likely by altering both , development of chemoresistance and response to chemotherapy . This result is of high clinical relevance because , if our assumption holds true , expression of these proteins could serve as predictive markers for therapy deci - sion and chemotherapy response .
