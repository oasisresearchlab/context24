CCVs assemble also at the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) and is responsible for the transport of proteins to other membranes . Oligomerization of clathrin and recruitment of adaptor protein complexes promote the budding and the release of CCVs . However , many of the details during plant CCV formation are not completely elucidated . The analysis of isolated CCVs is therefore important to better understand the formation of plant CCVs , their cargos and the regulation of clathrin - mediated transport processes . In this article , we describe an optimized method to isolate CCVs from Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings . Keywords : clathrin coated vesicles , density fractionation , Arabidopsis thaliana , negative staining , scanning electron microscopy INTRODUCTION Plants regulate their development to the changing environment by sensing and responding to environmental signals . Plasma membrane associated receptors , transporters and lipids play an important role in coordinating extracellular signals with intracellular responses . The regulation of plasma membrane proteins is therefore critical for optimal plant development and growth . Besides transcriptional control , endocytosis and subsequent endosomal traﬃcking of plasma membrane proteins is also essential for correct environmental responses ( Paez Valencia et al . , 2016 ) . The endocytosis of a membrane protein can be either dependent on clathrin ( clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ CME ] ) or independent ( McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ; Sandvig et al . , 2011 , 2018 ; Baisa et al . , 2013 ; Mayor et al . , 2014 ; Robinson , 2015 ) . Clathrin build a coat around the endocytosed vesicle to form a clathrin coated vesicle ( CCV ) . The clathrin coat is formed by multiple units composed of three clathrin heavy chains ( CHCs ) and three clathrin light chains ( CLCs ) that oligomerize together to form three - legged structures called triskelia . Several accessory proteins , in concert with the heterotetrameric adaptor complex ADAPTIN PROTEIN 2 ( AP2 ) , link the clathrin coat to the plasma membrane bilayer and recognize speciﬁc cargo proteins for endocytosis . Another important adaptor complex in Arabidopsis is the eight core - component complex TPLATE ( TPC ) that is important for clathrin recruitment at the plasma membrane and for the initiation of CME ( Van Damme et al . , 2011 ; Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ) .

Isolation of CCVs From Arabidopsis Seedlings Once the clathrin adaptors have selected the cargos and the clathrin coat is assembled to a clathrin coated pit ( CCP ) , the local membrane curvature resolves into a CCV upon scission from the plasma membrane . Once CCVs are released into the cytoplasm , they undergo uncoating before delivering their cargos to the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) / early endosomal compartment ( EE ) ( Dettmer et al . , 2006 ) . The endocytosed cargos can either be recycled back to the plasma membrane or transported to the vacuole for degradation ( Viotti et al . , 2010 ; Paez Valencia et al . , 2016 ; Reynolds et al . , 2018 ) . Clathrin is also recruited onto the TGN by adaptor complexes AP1 and AP3 . CCVs can be generated from the surface of the TGN and are responsible for post - Golgi traﬃcking to the vacuole and for transport to the plasma membrane ( Robinson and Pimpl , 2014 ; Rosquete et al . , 2018 ) . Research in the past decade has shown that clathrin - mediated transport is essential for important physiological processes in plants . Although many regulatory factors have been identiﬁed , we still lack in - depth understanding on the nature of CCV cargos and the exact mechanisms of clathrin - dependent vesicle traﬃcking . One limitation , so far , was the diﬃculty to isolate and analyze CCVs from diﬀerent Arabidopsis mutants . CCVs were originally isolated and puriﬁed from pig brains in which they are highly abundant ( Pearse , 1975 ) . In the original protocol , CCVs were enriched by diﬀerential centrifugation followed by linear sucrose density gradient centrifugations . This protocol was further improved by the use of isotonic linear D 2 O / Ficoll gradient ( Pearse , 1980 , 1982 ) . Two protocols for CCV isolation from suspension - cultured carrot cells and from Pisum sativum cotyledons were described ( Depta and Robinson , 1986 ; Harley and Beevers , 1989 ) . Both involve sucrose step - gradient centrifugation and linear D 2 O / Ficoll gradient centrifugation . Later , a method to isolate CCVs from Arabidopsis thaliana suspension - cultured cells was established based on these protocols ( Reynolds et al . , 2014 ) . In this article , we describe a modiﬁed method for CCV isolation from Arabidopsis seedlings . The protocol enables to circumvent the time - consuming steps required for the preparation of Arabidopsis suspension - cultured cells and allows isolation of CCVs directly from entire Arabidopsis seedlings .

Isolation of CCVs From Arabidopsis Seedlings FIGURE 3 | CCVs were prepared from total plant extract of 7 - day - old wild type ( A , B ) mRFP - ARA7 seedlings .

Isolation of CCVs From Arabidopsis Seedlings to standard protocols . Antibodies used for immunoblotting were anti - CHC ( Agrisera ) , anti - BIP2 ( Agrisera ) , anti - Sec21p ( Agrisera ) , anti - TOC75 ( Agrisera ) , anti - V - ATPase ( Agrisera ) , anti - RFP ( clone 6G6 ; Cromotek ) . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION To determine the presence of intact CCVs , we examined isolated CCVs from 7 - day - old wild - type seedlings under a scanning electron microscope . Negative staining and scanning electron microscopy analysis of the sample showed the presence of intact CCVs ( Figure 2 ) . Since uncoated vesicles were also present , we determined the relative amount of CCVs to the total number of intact membrane structures . We observed 60 . 3 % CCVs in two independent experiments ( n = 1714 vesicles ) . To further evaluate the purity of CCVs we analyzed the obtained samples by immunoblotting using an anti - CHC antibody and antibodies speciﬁc to intracellular organelles ( Figure 3A ) . CHC was enriched in the ﬁnal fraction , whereas other marker proteins for chloroplast ( TRANSLOCON ON THE OUTER CHLOROPLAST MEMBRANE 75 [ TOC75 ] ) , ER ( BINDING PROTEIN 2 [ BIP2 ] ) , Coat protein complex I ( COPI ) vesicles ( SECRETORY21 [ SEC21p ] ) , and vacuole ( V - ATPase SUBUNIT E1 [ VHA - E1 ] ) were not enriched in the CCV fraction . Together , these results suggest that CCVs were successfully isolated without major contamination of other organelles . We conducted the same experiment using 7 - d - old seedlings expressing the late endosome marker mRFP - ARABIDOPSIS RAB GTPase 7 ( ARA7 ) under the control of its native promoters ( Inada et al . , 2016 ) . When analyzed with the same antibodies used in Figure 3A , mRFP - ARA7 fractionated diﬀerently ( Figure 3B ) . Although , faint signals of mRFP - ARA7 were still visible in the CCV enriched fraction , in contrast to CHC , mRFP - ARA7 was not enriched when compared to the total lysate . Although there are reports of ﬂat clathrin patches on the surface of endosomes ( Smith and Farquhar , 1966 ; Prekeris et al . , 1998 ; Prekeris et al . , 1999 ; Raiborg et al . , 2001 , 2002 ; Sachse et al . , 2002 ; Williams and Urbe , 2007 ) , to date there is no evidence of CCV formation from ARA7 - positive late endosomal compartments . CONCLUSION The method presented here is suitable for the isolation of CCVs from Arabidopsis seedlings grown under standard conditions . This enables the quantitative and morphological analyses on CCVs and CCV - associated proteins from diﬀerent Arabidopsis mutant backgrounds or upon treatment with compounds of interest . We veriﬁed the successful enrichment and isolation of intact CCVs applying this method by immunoblotting and scanning electron microscopy .
