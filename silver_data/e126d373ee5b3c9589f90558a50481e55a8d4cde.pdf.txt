Introduction Integrins are  /  heterodimeric type I membrane receptors that mediate divalent cation – dependent interactions with components of the extracellular environment ( cells and soluble and matrix proteins ) leading to changes in cell shape , movement , growth , differentiation , and survival ( Hynes , 2002 ) . Determination of the crystal structure of the ectodomain of  V  3 ( ∆TM -  V  3 ) in the absence and presence of a prototypical RGD ligand revealed the modular nature of integrins and clarified the basis of its divalent cation – mediated interaction with extracellular ligands ( Xiong et al . , 2001 , 2002 ) . The 12 extracellular integrin domains are assembled into a head segment mounted on top of two leg segments . The integrin head comprises a seven - bladed  - propeller domain from  V and a vWFA (  A or I - like ) domain from  3 and contains the RGD - binding site . The  V leg is composed of an upper Ig - like thigh domain and a lower calf module consisting of two large  - sandwich domains , Calf - 1 and - 2 . The  3 leg con - sists of an upper leg segment comprising a plexin - semaphorin - integrin ( PSI ) , an Ig - like hybrid , and integrin IE1 ( EGF - like 1 ) domain , followed by a lower leg segment made up of three IE do - mains ( IE2 – 4 ) and a novel  - tail domain (  TD ) . ∆TM -  V  3 is bent in half at two knee - like joints , the  - and  - genu , the former between the thigh and Calf - 2 domains and the latter predicted between IE1 and - 2 ( Xiong et al . , 2001 ) , such that the head and upper leg segments of the heterodimer contact the lower leg seg - ments of the same molecule . Binding of the F3 subdomain of the talin head to the cyto - plasmic tail of the  subunit breaks an  /  salt bridge ( that nor - mally stabilizes the inactive state ; Wegener et al . , 2007 ) , triggering a conformational wave that travels through the  /  transmem - brane ( TM ) and lower leg domains to switch the conformationally sensitive  A domain to a high affinity state , which is a process W e determined the crystal structure of 1TM -  V  3 , which represents the complete unconstrained ectodomain plus short C - terminal transmem - brane stretches of the  V and  3 subunits . 1TM -  V  3 is more compact and less active in solution when compared with ∆TM -  V  3 , which lacks the short C - terminal stretches . The structure reveals a bent conformation and defines the  –  interface between IE2 ( EGF - like 2 ) and the thigh domains . Modifying this interface by site - directed muta - genesis leads to robust integrin activation . Fluorescent life - time imaging microscopy of inactive full - length  V  3 on live cells yields a donor – membrane acceptor distance , which is consistent with the bent conformation and does not change in the activated integrin . These data are the first direct demonstration of conformational coupling of the integrin leg and head domains , identify the IE2 – thigh inter - face as a critical steric barrier in integrin activation , and suggest that inside - out activation in intact cells may in - volve conformational changes other than the postulated switch to a genu - linear state .

T H E J O U R N A L O F C E L L B I O L O G Y JCB • VOLUME 186 • NUMBER 4 • 2009 590 complete TM domains (  V  3 - cTM ) . Functional experiments showed that modifying the defined IE2 – thigh interface leads to constitutive activation . Fluorescent lifetime imaging microscopy ( FLIM ) using ligated Fab fragment of the anti –  V propeller mAb 17E6 ( Mitjans et al . 1995 ) as fluorescence donor and the plasma membrane dye FM4 - 64 FX as acceptor yielded donor – membrane acceptor separation distances consistent with the  V  3 - cTM structure model , which did not vary between the inactive and active states of the full - length integrin in live cells . These data demonstrate a conformational link between the lower leg and head domains , define the crystal structure of a near native com - plete ectodomain , identify a critical steric barrier to activation at the IE2 – thigh interface , and suggest that the genu - linear state is not an obligate feature of inside - out activation . Results Expression and biophysical characterization of 1TM -  V  3 Published structures of ∆TM -  V  3 ( Xiong et al . , 2001 ) and ∆TM -  IIb  3 ( Zhu et al . , 2008 ) lacked the last seven extracellu - lar residues from the  subunit and P691 - D692 from the  3 subunit ( Fig . 1 A ) . We expressed in insect cells an  V  3 ecto - domain , 1TM -  V  3 , encoding all of the missing extracellular residues in addition to a four - residue TM extension of each sub - unit . 1TM -  V  3 was secreted into the culture supernatant of virus - infected High - Five insect cells ( Fig . 1 B ) and was purified by affinity chromatography ( Fig . 1 C ) . The isocratic elution profiles of purified 1TM -  V  3 and ∆TM -  V  3 were compared on molecular sieve chromatography columns in neutral buffer containing the physiological divalent cations 1 mM Ca 2 + + 1 mM Mg 2 + ( Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + ) or 1 mM of the activating cation Mn 2 . The apparent hydrodynamic radius ( Stokes called inside - out activation ( Hynes , 2002 ) . Direct evidence for the conformational coupling of the lower leg and head domains is indirect . And how inside - out activation converts the ecto - domain to the high affinity state is still ill defined . Modeling the lower integrin legs of the ectodomain perpendicular to the plasma membrane placed the ligand - binding head near the lipid bilayer , seemingly blocking access to macromolecular ligands ( for re - view see Arnaout et al . , 2005 ) . A switchblade model ( Takagi et al . , 2002 ) proposed that disruption of the  /  cytoplasmic – TM domain interfaces converts the bent ectodomain to a genu - linear conformation , providing ligand access and allowing  A to switch to high affinity . An alternate model , the deadbolt , proposed that lifting the constraints exerted on  A by the lower leg  TD can induce activation without linearity ( Xiong et al . , 2003 ) . Com - plete structural information on the remaining  /  residues in the lower leg segments and the conformationally sensitive IE1 / IE2 region are missing or incomplete in current structures of the integrin ectodomains ( Xiong et al . , 2001 ; Zhu et al . , 2008 ) , and knowledge of the distance separating the ligand - binding integrin head from the plasma membrane in the inactive and active states is crucial to elucidate the conformational transitions and energetics of affinity switching in integrins . In this communication , we engineered a new construct , 1TM -  V  3 , encoding the complete sequence of the  V  3 ectodomain plus the first four TM residues of each subunit . 1TM -  V  3 was water soluble at neutral pH and was monomeric , which allowed characterization of its biophysical and functional properties and a determination of its crystal structure . 1TM -  V  3 was hydrodynamically more compact and less active than ∆TM -  V  3 in solution . Its crystal structure revealed a bent conforma - tion and defined the complete structure of the ectodomain , including that of the IE1 / IE2 region and TM extensions , permitting us to build a structure model comprising the bent ectodomain plus the Figure 1 .

The crystal structure of ∆TM -  V  3 ( Xiong et al . , 2001 ) ends at Q956 in  V and G690 in  3 ( closed arrows ) ; ∆TM -  IIb  3 terminates at the cor - responding  IIb residue A958 and at G690 in  3 ( Zhu et al . , 2008 ) .

Lanes 1 and 4 show mo - lecular mass ( mm ) markers . The 1TM -  V and 1TM -  3 subunits migrated with those from ∆TM -  V  3 , as expected for the small ( < 1 % ) increase in mass caused by the additional C - terminal sequences .

Crystal structure of 1TM -  V  3 A new native dataset derived from one 1TM -  V  3 crystal let us determine the structure of the 1TM -  V  3 , including the TM ex - tensions , at 2 . 9 - Å resolution ( Fig . 4 ) . The structure was super - posable on the ∆TM -  V  3 structure ( Xiong et al . , 2001 , 2004 ) except for those regions newly expressed , the C - terminal exofacial , and the TM residues ( Fig . 4 A ) and now resolved the IE1 and - 2 domains ( Fig . 4 , B – D ) . The nearly parallel exofacial extensions I955 - P959 ( in  V ) and P688 - G690 ( in  3 ) remain close through A958 and G690 ( C  – C  = 6 . 2 Å ) and then diverge at an extended Pro - rich loop structure in  V ( P959APMPVP963 ) before the first putative  TM residue V964 . Structure search of this Pro - rich sequence yielded such loops in two contexts ( Protein Data Bank numbers 2w55 and 2q0s ) , suggesting that this extended structure is not a crystal artifact but also exists in the native integrin . The first TM residues V964 ( in  V ) and I963 ( in  3 ) occupy similar posi - tions in the structure , but the TM extensions do not assume the  - helical turns found in the nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) structure of the  /  TM domains ( Lau et al . , 2009 ) and do not interact as the result of unfavorable crystal contacts . The three tandem integrin domains IE2 – 4 are related by an approximately twofold screw axis symmetry and form an ex - tended module ( Fig . 4 C ) . IE1 is roughly antiparallel to IE2 , as a result of the bend at the  - genu ( Fig . 4 C ) . Each IE domain has three disulphides ( a – c ) having the same connectivity a N - a C , b N - b C , c N - c C as that found in other EGF domains ( Fig . 4 E ; Wouters et al . , 2005 ) . IE1 lacks disulphide a ( a N - a C ) , thus potentially avoid - ing a clash with the adjacent PSI domain . A characteristic forth N - terminal intradomain disulphide d ( d N - d C ) occupies an analo - gous site to the Ca coordination site found in the Ca - binding subset of EGF domains ( Wouters et al . , 2005 ) . IE1 – 4 each contain radius [ Rs ] ) of 1TM -  V  3 was calculated by reference to the elution position of standard proteins ( Fig . 2 ) . Rs of 1TM -  V  3 changed from 55 ± 0 . 41 Å ( mean ± SD ; n = 4 ) in Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + to 58 ± 0 . 3 Å in Mn 2 + . The Rs values for ∆TM -  V  3 in Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + and Mn 2 + were 57 ± 1 . 1 Å and 60 ± 1 . 1 Å , respectively . Thus , the mean Rs value for 1TM -  V  3 in Mn 2 + differed little from that of ∆TM -  V  3 in Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + . The small amounts of oligo - mers in the ∆TM -  V  3 preparations in the presence of Mn 2 + were largely absent in 1TM -  V  3 , and the peak width at half height , which is a measure of molecular heterogeneity , was nar - rower for 1TM than for ∆TM . These data suggest that the short C - terminal  /  extensions introduced in 1TM result in a more compact and homogenous molecule in solution . Binding of soluble 1TM -  V  3 to physiological ligands and to the activation - sensitive mAb AP5 We performed dose – response curves to quantify the binding of increasing concentrations of 1TM -  V  3 to immobilized FN7 – 10 in Mn 2 + and in Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) . Half - maximal binding was achieved at 0 . 1 µg / ml and 6 . 0 µg / ml , respectively ( n = 2 ) . For soluble  TM -  V  3 , half - maximal binding was achieved at 0 . 15 µg / ml and 1 . 6 µg / ml , respectively . No binding took place to uncoated wells or fibronectin ( FN ) - coated wells in the presence of cilengitide ( unpublished data ) . Soluble 1TM -  V  3 formed a stable complex with either FN7 – 10 ( Fig . 3 C ) or na - tive full - length FN ( Fig . 3 D and Table S1 ) in solution in Mn 2 + - containing buffer ( Fig . 3 D and Table S1 ) . Also consistent with the solid phase binding assays , soluble 1TM -  V  3 did not form a stable complex with either FN7 – 10 or full - length FN in Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + buffer ( Fig . 3 D , inset ; Table S1 ; and not depicted ) . How - ever , soluble 1TM -  V  3 formed a stable complex in 2 mM of CaCl 2 ( or Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + ) buffer with the Fab fragment of AP5 ( Fig . 3 E ) , a ligand - inducible binding site mAb which binds Figure 2 .

Purified ∆TM -  V  3 or 1TM -  V  3 in TBS , pH 7 . 4 , containing 1 mM MgCl 2 + 1 mM CaCl 2 or 0 . 2 mM MnCl 2 was analyzed .

JCB • VOLUME 186 • NUMBER 4 • 2009 592 three  strands ( A – C ) , with the first two antiparallel strands ( A and B ) forming a major  sheet found in classical EGF domains . Strand C is hydrogen bonded to strand D , which is contributed in part by the consecutive domain , with strands C and D forming a minor  sheet – like conformation . A short strand D caps the IE4 domain , which is stabilized by the C601 - C604 disulphide linker that precedes the start of the  TD . In IE1 – 4 , strand D has a charac - teristic  bulge at a conserved E / N residue ( E472 , E522 , N559 and E599 , respectively ) to allow accommodation of disulphide c ; its cross - strand partner in strand C is an invariant Gly ( G468 , G518 , G555 , G595 , respectively ) , which is found typically in class II EGF domains ( Wouters et al . , 2005 ) and some laminin - type epidermal growth factor – like domains ( Stetefeld et al . , 1996 ) . IE2 has two characteristically long loops , c ( between c N and c C ) and d ( between d N and a N ; Fig . 4 E ) , with the latter housing the  - genu ( Fig . 4 B ) . The  - genu is clearly visible in the electron density map despite lack of crystal contacts from symmetry - related molecules , which is stabilized by hydrogen bonds to the major sheet of IE2 . The two long loops and strand A of IE2 face the bottom of the thigh domain , making mainly electrostatic con - tacts with its CC  and EF loops ( Fig . 4 D ) . The minor strand of IE2 faces the N - terminal segment of PSI and forms ionic and van der Waals contacts involving mainly T7 - R8 of the PSI domain . Extending the 1TM structure into the  /  TM fragment , which overlaps with structured residues in the NMR structure of  IIb  3 TM domains ( Lau et al . , 2009 ) , allowed us to build a structure model of the inactive ectodomain plus the com - plete TM domains ( Fig . 4 , F – H ) . In this model , the ligand - binding site is accessible to macromolecular ligands , and the extracellular membrane proximal segment is structured . By comparison , in the recent structure model of the  IIb  3 Figure 3 . Binding of 1TM -  V  3 to physiological ligands and to the Fab fragment of the activation - sensitive mAb AP5 .

Functional effects on activity of full - length  V  3 after mutation of features structurally defined in the 1TM structure We assessed the effects on cellular  V  3 caused by modifying the newly defined IE2 – thigh interface through a  - genu dele - tion (  - genu ) , altering the  TD – hybrid – IE3 interfaces by breaking two salt bridges ( R404A + R633A ) , and changing the  A –  TD – hybrid interfaces by deleting the  TD CD loop plus ectodomain plus TM domains ( Zhu et al . , 2009 ) , this region is not structurally defined and assumed to be very flexible in the inactive integrin model . However , inserting a flexible linker into the extracellular membrane proximal Pro - rich sequence of the  2 integrin  subunit CD11b leads to a constitutively active integrin ( Kamata et al . , 2005 ) , suggesting that some ri - gidity in this region is essential to maintain the integrin in its inactive conformation .

The model is built by releasing the C termini in the 1TM -  V  3 structure from their respective crystal contacts , such that extracellular P691 and P963 initiate the respective  3 and  V TM helices , which is consistent with the known propen - sity of prolines to strongly stabilize  - helical conformations ( Senes et al . , 2004 ) . ( F and G ) The resulting movements included a 2 . 9 - Å inward movement of P691 of  3 ( F ) and a rotation of  V’s Pro - rich loop at Q956 , such that P963 initiates the  V TM helix ( modeled after  IIb’s TM NMR structure ; G ; Lau et al . , 2009 ) . The structure model was energy minimized with Modeller ( Fiser and Sali , 2003 ) , and the  V  3 TM side chains were optimized and repacked using Rosetta ( Rohl et al . , 2004 ) . The ribbon diagrams in F and G were generated using PyMOL ( DeLano Scientific LLC ) . ( H ) A ribbon diagram , which was generated using Chimera , of the  V  3 - cTM model showing the orientation of the ectodomain relative to the TM domains . The model predicts that the TM domains are at an  30° angle relative to the long axis of Calf - 2 , with ADMIDAS ( adjacent to MIDAS ) metal ion ( green sphere ) at an  45 - Å distance from the plane parallel to the hypothetical membrane drawn at the C  of  3  s Pro691 .

JCB • VOLUME 186 • NUMBER 4 • 2009 594 Mn 2 + - activated WT  V  3 did not affect binding of fluorescently labeled soluble monomeric FN10 , either as WT or as a high affin - ity form ( Fig . 6 A ) . The RGD ligand cilengitide also triggered an increase in hydrodynamic radius of the 17E6 – 1TM -  V  3 com - plex ( Fig . 6 B ) , indicating that 17E6 Fab did not freeze either membrane - bound or soluble  V  3 in an inactive state . The plasma membrane was labeled with FM4 - 64 FX ( FM ) as accep - tor . This dye preferentially inserts into the outer leaflet of the membrane of live cells in 1 – 5 min at 4°C , fluoresces brightly , and can be rapidly fixed with ice - cold paraformaldehyde , eliminating diffusion on the time scale of FLIM measurements . The standard equation to calculate FRET efficiency applies to populations of fluorophores in such circumstances and is frequently used in bio - logical systems to report mean donor – acceptor distances . Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescence lifetime was first measured in inactive WT  V  3 – expressing K562 cells stained with Alexa Fluor 488 – Fab in 1 mM of CaCl 2 - containing buffer . A lifetime of 2 , 306 ± 52 ps ( mean ± SD ) was determined in the absence of acceptor ( Fig . 6 , C and D ) . When the Alexa Fluor 488 – Fab - labeled K562 cells were further labeled with the FM membrane dye , Alexa Fluor 488 lifetime decreased to 2 , 056 ± 118 ps ( P < 0 . 0001 ) , corresponding to a FRET efficiency of 10 . 8 % and a mean donor – acceptor separation distance ( r ) of 88 Å . The re - spective values for the Mn 2 + - activated  V  3 were 2 , 322 ± 43 ps in the absence of acceptor and 2 , 087 ± 118 ps ( P < 0 . 0001 ) after addition of the FM dye , corresponding to a FRET efficiency of 10 . 1 % and a mean donor – acceptor separation distance ( r ) of 89 Å . This distance is consistent with the hypothetical structure model depicted in Fig . 4 H , which predicts an  90 - Å distance from the centroid of the integrin - bound 17E6 Fab to the plane of the membrane parallel drawn at the C  of  3’s P691 residue . Mean donor – acceptor separation distances of 78 ± 9 Å ( mean ± SD ) and 83 ± 3 Å were obtained with unliganded  V  3 and with high affinity FN10 - bound  V  3 , respectively , each in 1 mM of Mn 2 + - containing buffer . FLIM measurements conducted on transiently transfected HEK 293T cells expressing WT , G989FF / GAA , or  - genu  V  3 in 1 mM of Mn 2 + - containing buffer an R633A substitution (  CD + R633A ) . The activating G989FF / GAA mutation ( Zhu et al . , 2007 ) served as a positive control . None of the mutations impaired expression or heterodimer for - mation compared with wild type ( WT ) , as judged by reactivity with the  3 - specific AP3 mAb and the heterodimer - specific LM609 mAb ( unpublished data ) . Mn 2 + increased binding of the WT receptor to soluble Alexa Fluor 488 – labeled FN9 – 10 from 7 % in Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + buffer to 48 % of the AP3 - positive cell popula - tion in Mn 2 + . The  - genu mutation induced constitutive acti - vation that was significantly more robust than the G989FF / GAA mutant ( Fig . 5 ) , with a more modest activation induced by the R404A + R633A mutation . The activating effect of the  CD + R633A mutation was small but significant ( P < 0 . 005 ; Fig . 5 ) . FLIM analysis of  V  3 in live cells We used FLIM to assess the orientation of the  V  3 ectodomain relative to the plasma membrane in K562 cells stably expressing WT  V  3 . For lifetime calculations , FLIM collects only photons emitted from the donor fluorophores , thus avoiding the problem of mis - excitation of the acceptor and the analogous problem of spectral break through bleeding of the donor signal into the acceptor spectral window , which are common concerns in spec - tral fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) applications ( Chigaev et al . , 2001 ; Kim et al . , 2003 ; Coutinho et al . , 2007 ) . Importantly , FLIM allows picosecond measurements and is inde - pendent of concentration of the fluorophores . As fluorescence energy transfer between a donor – acceptor pair described by the Förster equation depends both on the dis - tance and the relative orientation of donor and acceptor ( Jares - Erijman and Jovin , 2003 ; Giepmans et al . , 2006 ) , it is critical that a structurally defined probe be used as donor . Therefore , we used the Fab fragment of mAb 17E6 whose low resolution epitope mapping ( Mould et al . , 2000 ) corresponds to its crystal structure bound to the  - propeller of ∆TM -  V  3 , which we have deter - mined ( 17E6 binds at the top of the propeller contacting the DA loop between blades 2 and 3 and the CD loop in blade 3 ; unpub - lished data ) .

The histogram ( mean ± SD ; n = 3 ) shows binding of Alexa Fluor 488 – FN9 – 10 to WT and mutant surface - expressed  V  3 . The percentage of FN9 – 10 - bound cells was expressed as a percentage of AP3 - bound cells . Binding of WT and each of the mutants in Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + was then expressed as a percentage of that obtained for the Mn 2 + - activated WT integrin , with the lat - ter set at 100 . 595 CRYSTAL STRUCTURE 1TM -  V  3 • Xiong et al . TM domains , ( c ) functional analyses using the 1TM -  V  3 crys - tal structure identified a critical role for the newly defined IE2 – thigh interface in integrin activation , and ( d ) FLIM of WT  V  3 in live cells revealed that the apparent distance between the integrin head and the plasma membrane changes little in inactive , Mn 2 + - activated , constitutively active , or FN10 - bound full - length integrin . We found that 1TM -  V  3 is recognized in solution by the activation - sensitive mAb AP5 in 2 mM Ca 2 + but did not form a sta - ble complex in solution with FN7 – 10 or full - length FN , unless the integrin is activated by Mn 2 + . Quantitative binding assays showed that K d ( app ) values of 1TM -  V  3 and ∆TM -  V  3 binding to im - mobilized FN7 – 10 in Mn 2 + are comparable ( 0 . 15 and 0 . 1 µg / ml ) . However , binding of 1TM -  V  3 and ∆TM -  V  3 in Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + buffer yielded K d ( app ) values that were  60 - fold and  10 - fold lower , respectively , than in Mn 2 + ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) , reflecting the proportion of the active species in each preparation . Thus , 1TM , which differs only in the added  /  lower leg , is less active and yielded mean donor – acceptor separation distances of 96 Å , 94 Å , and 90 Å , respectively . Thus , the donor – acceptor separation dis - tances are comparable in the inactive , Mn 2 + - activated , constitu - tively active , or FN10 - bound states of the full - length  V  3 expressed on the surface of live cells . It is appropriate to men - tion here that the calculated length of the genu - linear  V  3 molecule is > 200 Å ( Xiong et al . , 2001 ) . Discussion Our major findings in this study are that ( a ) the C - terminal ex - tensions of the  V  3 ectodomain by the remaining exofacial residues and four  /  TM residues gave a water soluble and con - formationally stable integrin that is predominantly inactive in Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + buffer in solution , ( b ) crystal structure of the near na - tive 1TM -  V  3 in Ca 2 + defined the first complete structure of an integrin ectodomain plus an  /  TM fragment and allowed us to build a structure model of the ectodomain plus the complete Figure 6 .

Bar , 8 µm . JCB • VOLUME 186 • NUMBER 4 • 2009 596 on the metal ion coordination in  A . In the unliganded ∆TM -  IIb  3 structure , the LIMBS residue D 217 points toward LIMBS ( and not away from it as in 1TM -  V  3 ) to avoid a clash with a hydrophobic residue ( Phe191 , which is a Trp in all other  sub - units ; Fig . S1 ) . This orientation provides five coordination sites for a LIMBS Ca 2 + , with the sixth coordination site completed by OE1 of E220 , which is thus pulled out of the MIDAS pocket , allowing coordination of an Mg 2 + at the MIDAS . As 1TM -  V  3 is the fourth integrin crystal structure re - solved in a bent conformation under conditions that activate li - gand binding in biochemical and cell biological assays , we once again addressed the contentious issue of the conformation of the integrin  V  3 at the cell surface . We positioned a FLIM donor on the integrin head and an acceptor in the outer face of the plasma membrane . FLIM measurements revealed no significant change in mean separation distance of the integrin head relative to the plasma membrane outer face in Mn 2 + - activated WT  V  3 compared with the inactive integrin ( Fig . 6 , C and D ) . A previ - ous FRET study measured the distance between an FITC - labeled ligand - mimetic peptide as donor and a plasma membrane dye as acceptor ( Chigaev et al . , 2003 ) . There , the change in mean distance of closest approach was  50 Å between resting and Mn 2 + - activated  4  1 . However , as stated by the authors , the membrane dye used , R18 , has a tendency to flip - flop between the outer and inner leaflets of the plasma membrane , introducing uncertainty in the measurements . The FLIM methodology we have used minimizes this problem and supports a more recent cryoelectron tomography study of liposome - embedded and Mn 2 + - activated  IIb  3 ( Ye et al . , 2008 ) . Interestingly , high af - finity soluble monomeric FN10 bound to the WT  V  3 in Mn 2 + or the constitutive activation of  V  3 by G989FF / GAA or ∆  - genu mutants also failed to trigger an increase in the mean donor – membrane acceptor separation distance compared with the inactive WT integrin . The simplest explanation for these data is that a switch of the integrin from the inactive to the active state or its binding to soluble FN10 in live cells can occur with little or no genu extension , which is consistent with a recent modeling study ( Rocco et al . , 2008 ) . The functional experiments presented in this study identify a previously unappreciated but critical role for the IE2 – thigh interface in stabilizing the inactive state ( Fig . 7 ) . This is reflected by the robust constitutive activation introduced in the surface - expressed receptor upon deletion of the  - genu , which contrib - utes to this interface . Our results also show that stability of the IE2 – thigh interface appears to be conformationally linked to the lower leg extensions introduced in 1TM -  V  3 . Other mutations in the lower leg domain that interrupt two salt bridges linking the  TD and IE3 to the top and bottom of the hybrid domain , respec - tively ( Fig . 7 ) , revealed that these make a modest contribution to stability of the inactive state : in  V  3 , the steric barrier is mainly mediated by the IE3 – hybrid contact , whereas the  TD – hybrid contact appears to predominate in  IIb  3 ( Matsumoto et al . , 2008 ) . Our functional experiments also show that  TD contacts with both  A and hybrid domains contribute to stability of the inactive conformation , although this contribution is minor in  V  3 and absent in  IIb  3 when the  TD –  A contact alone is removed by deleting the CD loop in  TD ( Zhu et al . , 2007 ) . hydrodynamically more compact than ∆T , reflecting a conforma - tional coupling between the lower leg and head domains that regu - lates integrin activation . Our present findings are also consistent with the integrin existing in equilibrium between two major quater - nary states , inactive ( T state ) and active ( R state ; Perutz , 1989 ) , with the T state predominating in soluble 1TM -  V  3 in Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + buffer . mAb AP5 binds preferentially in Ca 2 + or Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + buffer to the minor active species ( estimated at  2 % and  10 % in 1TM - and ∆TM -  V  3 preparations , respectively ) , driving the quaternary equilibrium toward the active quaternary state ( s ) and stabilizing it there ( Fig . 3 E ) . The same shift can be accomplished by FN7 – 10 or by native FN but requires Mn 2 + not Ca 2 + , presumably because of the higher affinity of Mn 2 + to the metal ion – dependent adhesion site ( MIDAS ) that mediates  V  3 interaction with ligands . Using the measured K d ( app ) values as approximations of binding affinities , the mean difference in energy between the two major quaternary states of 1TM - and ∆TM -  V  3 is estimated at  2 . 4 kcal / mol and 1 . 4 kcal / mol , respectively . It is expected that this value will be even higher for the full - length integrin . The crystal structure of ∆TM -  IIb  3 at 2 . 55 - Å resolution reported ( Zhu et al . , 2008 ) while this work was under review ends at the equivalent residues to ∆TM -  V  3 and thus lacks those lower leg residues and TM fragments defined in the current 1TM -  V  3 structure and shown to regulate affinity . Superposition of the ∆TM -  IIb  3 structure onto that of 1TM -  V  3 using Match - maker in the Chimera software suite ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) revealed several interesting differences between these two struc - tures . First , a significant inward rotation of Calf - 1 and - 2 at the  - genu in ∆TM -  IIb  3 resulting from crystal contacts with sym - metry - related molecules was associated with translational move - ments in the IE2 – 4 domains . Second , the  - genu is missing in the ∆TM -  IIb  3 structure , where it is presumed disordered ( Zhu et al . , 2008 ) . Yet , significant changes appear in the main chain flanking the  - genu in ∆TM -  IIb  3 compared with 1TM -  V  3 , suggesting proteolytic cleavage within this site in ∆TM -  IIb  3 as another likely explanation . Third , the  TD of ∆TM -  IIb  3 veers toward IE4 and away from the hybrid /  A domains , break - ing the R633 - coordinated salt bridge , which stabilizes the inactive state of full - length  IIb  3 ( Matsumoto et al . , 2008 ) . The engineered disulphide linking  TD to Calf - 2 in ∆TM -  IIb  3 may impose these quaternary changes in the  TD environment . Fourth , the  A domain of unliganded ∆TM -  IIb  3 contained the MIDAS and the stimulatory ligand - associated metal - binding site ( LIMBS ) metal ions ( Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + , respectively ) , but no metal ions were present in the 1TM -  V  3 2 . 9 - Å structure formed in the presence of Ca 2 + ( Fig . S1 ) or in our published 3 . 1 - Å unliganded ∆TM -  V  3 structure ( Xiong et al . , 2001 ) , even when Mn 2 + was diffused into the crystals . Lower resolution ( Zhu et al . , 2008 ) is an unlikely explanation for this difference , as both metal ions are overt in the 3 . 2 - Å structure of the ∆TM -  V  3 – cRGD com - plex ( Xiong et al . , 2002 ) . Furthermore , in native  A isolated from the  3 subunit , LIMBS did not bind Ca 2 + ( Pesho et al . , 2006 ) , so the absence of a LIMBS Ca 2 + in unliganded  3 is independently supported . Whether clasping the legs covalently by an artificial disulphide permits metal occupancy at LIMBS through allosteric mechanisms remains an open question . A likely interpretation is that the difference reflects an influence of the associated  subunit 597 CRYSTAL STRUCTURE 1TM -  V  3 • Xiong et al . The shape of the quaternary R ( active ) state of the integrin ectodomain remains to be defined structurally . But it includes the high affinity state of  A and a proposed genu - linear conformation , which , it is argued , is required for switching  A to the active state ( Takagi et al . , 2002 ) . In the homologous  A domain , the high affin - ity state is characterized by an inward movement of the N - terminal  1 helix and a two - turn downward movement of the C - terminal  7 helix , which is permitted by a flexible long linker distally ( Lee et al . , 1995 ) . The former movement was observed in the crystal structure of the bent cRGD - bound ∆TM -  V  3 ( Xiong et al . , 2002 ) but in the absence of the axial movement of  7 helix , which is constrained distally in the bent crystal structure by the hybrid domain . The activating effect of releasing constraints on the hybrid in the R633 + R404 mutant is consistent with previous work performed on integrin ectodomains with modified , truncated , or entirely amputated legs ( Mould et al . , 2003 ; Xiao et al . , 2004 ) , which found a correlation between opening the  A – hybrid hinge and the high affinity state of  A . An  70° hinge opening in the legless ectodomain structure ( Xiao et al . , 2004 ) , which is associated with a one - turn downward movement of the C - terminal  7 helix , led to the conclusion that this feature characterizes the high affinity state of  A . However , a recent study ( Chigaev et al . , 2009 ) found that the hybrid domain movement and the high affinity state are regulated separately and independently of each other . And an EM study of the intact ∆TM -  V  3 ectodomain complexed with FN7 – extra do - main B – 10 detected only a small 11 ± 4° opening of the  A – hybrid hinge angle ( Adair et al . , 2005 ) , which is sufficient to break the IE2 – thigh interface , suggesting that a rather modest hinge opening may be all that is needed to switch  A to high affinity . Consistently , a molecular dynamics study of the legless  IIb  3 ectodomain de - tected a spontaneous  A – hybrid hinge opening of  20° when a single N303 - K417 bond linking  A to hybrid is broken ( Puklin - Faucher et al . , 2006 ) , but over the course of this increase , a lateral rather than the axial shift of the  A domain C - terminal  7 helix was observed . The same study found that subsequent pulling on bound FN10 caused the  A – hybrid domain hinge to further increase to 70° in the legless ectodomain , suggesting that the wider hinge opening requires force applied on a ligand - bound integrin . Whether such an extreme movement requires preconversion of the ectodomain to a genu - linear structure or can occur in a genu - bent conformation re - quires further study . Our data suggest that overcoming the critical IE2 – thigh steric barrier through the activating  - genu deletion does not require a genu - linear conversion . It may also be relevant that binding of soluble monomeric high affinity FN10 did not induce genu linearity in the full - length  V  3 , suggesting that the high af - finity state and genu linearity are not conformationally linked events , an interpretation which is consistent with experimental observations in WT and modified integrins ( Takagi et al . , 2003 ; Coutinho et al . , 2007 ; Gupta et al . , 2007 ) . It has been proposed that genu linearity requires force applied by the cytoskeleton to the cytoplasmic tails of the unliganded integrin ( Zhu et al . , 2008 ) . However , our FLIM data on constitutively active  V  3 suggest that this remains as bent as the inactive molecule . It is possible that the transition to the genu - linear state requires that force be exerted on both ends of an integrin , as when it is bound simultaneously to an immobilized ECM ligand and to the cytoskeleton in mechanically stressed tissues ( for review see Arnaout et al . , 2005 ) . Previous studies have shown that disulphides introduced at the  TD –  A or  TD – Calf - 2 interfaces blocked integrin activation ( Takagi et al . , 2002 ; Kamata et al . , 2005 ) , suggesting that the small barriers at these nodes must also be overcome in the con - formational switch of the integrin to the active state . Collectively , these data suggest that binding of the F3 subdomain of talin to the  3 cytoplasmic tail ( mimicked by the G989FF / GAA mutant ; Wegener et al . , 2007 ) unravels the  /  TM packing , triggering movement of the membrane - proximal lower leg domains , reduc - ing the energy cost of destabilizing the critical IE2 – thigh inter - face ( Fig . 7 ) , which then drives the conformational equilibrium toward the quaternary R state almost completely ( Fig . 5 ) . Figure 7 . Ribbon diagram showing functionally relevant ionic contacts in the 1TM -  V  3 structure . IE2 makes several electrostatic contacts with two conserved loops at the bottom of the thigh domain . These include E500 from IE2 making a salt bridge with the conserved CC  loop residue K503 and an H - bond with the invariant EF loop residue D550 ( both from the thigh domain ) and the  - genu residues E476 and D477 making H - bonds with the EF residue E547 . Two salt bridges ( R633 – D393 and R404 – D550 ) link the top and bottom of the hybrid domain to  TD and IE3 , respectively . The small  TD –  A interface ( S674 – V332 , in gray ) and an H - bond between the  TD ( D606 ) and Calf - 2 ( S749 ; Kamata et al . , 2005 ) are also shown .

Using ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health ) , the measured intensities of the stained 1TM -  V  3 and FN7 – 10 gel bands ( Fig . 3 C ) were 16 , 514 arbitrary units and 3 , 468 arbitrary units , respec - tively , which is a 4 . 76 : 1 ratio , yielding a 1 : 1 stoichiometry , when the molecular masses of 1TM -  V  3 ( 180 . 451 kD ) and FN7 – 10 ( 39 . 846 kD ) are considered ( a ratio of 4 . 53 : 1 ) . Binding of 1TM -  V  3 to the activation - sensitive mAb AP5 Binding of soluble 1TM -  V  3 to the Fab fragment of the ligand - inducible binding site mAb AP5 ( provided by P . J . Newman , Medical College of Wisconsin , Milwaukee , WI ; Honda et al . , 1995 ) was performed by mixing the integrin with the Fab in a 1 : 1 . 4 stoichiometric ratio for 30 min on ice in TBS containing 2 mM CaCl 2 . The complex was detected by molecular sieve chromatography in TBS plus 2 mM CaCl 2 , and the eluted peaks were analyzed on 12 % SDS - PAGE followed by Coomassie staining . Band inten - sities for the unreduced stained gels corresponding to 1TM -  V  3 and AP5 Fab ( Fig . 3 E ) were 7 , 479 . 5 arbitrary units ( for combined  V and  3 bands ) and 2 , 074 . 7 arbitrary units , respectively ( integrin / Fab ratio of 3 . 6 : 1 ) , yielding a 1 : 1 stoichiometry , with a molecular mass ratio of  3 . 6 : 1 ( the calculated molecular mass of Fab is 50 kD ) . mAb and soluble ligand binding to cell surface – expressed  V  3 WT  V  3 – expressing K562 or transiently transfected HEK cells ( 6 × 10 5 cells per sample ) were stained in suspension with 10 µg / ml LM609 and 10 µg / ml AP3 mAbs or 20 µg / ml 17E6 Fab in 100 µl TBS containing 0 . 5 % BSA plus 1 mM CaCl 2 + 1 mM MgCl 2 or 1 mM MnCl 2 for 30 min at RT . After washing , cells were incubated with the fluorophore - conjugated anti – mouse IgG or the anti - Fab antibody at 0°C for 30 min , washed , fixed , and then analyzed by flow cytometry using the CellQuest software ( BD ) . FN binding was assessed in parallel by incubating  V  3 - expressing K562 or batches of transient - transfected HEK 293T with mAb AP3 at 0°C for 45 min and then with 10 µg / ml of Alexa Fluor 488 – labeled FN9 – 10 or FN10 and with Cy3 - labeled goat anti – mouse IgG1 in TBS buffer containing 1 mM CaCl 2 + 1 mM MgCl 2 or 1 mM MnCl 2 at 20°C for 30 min . After washing , cells were fixed and analyzed by flow cytometry , and the percentage of AP3 - positive cells bound to FN was determined . To assess the effect of un - labeled 17E6 Fab prebound to cellular  V  3 on subsequent binding of Alexa Fluor 488 – FN10 , K562 cells were first incubated in the absence or presence of a saturating amount of Fab ( at 30 µg / ml ) as in the previous section , washed , incubated at 20°C for 30 min with limiting concentrations of WT or high affinity Alexa Fluor 488 – FN10 ( at 10 µg / ml and 2 µg / ml , respectively ) , and then analyzed by FACS , and binding was expressed as the percentage of the LM609 - positive cells stained in parallel . Hydrodynamic shift assay for locked integrin To investigate whether 17E6 Fab binding locked 1TM -  V  3 in an inactive conformation , 17E6 Fab was incubated in TBS containing 0 . 2 mM Mn 2 + ( MBB buffer ) with 1TM -  V  3 ( 1 . 5 : 1 Fab / integrin molar ratio ) at 20°C for 1 . 5 h . Aliquots were taken and chromatographed at this time point , and the preformed complex was challenged by adding cilengitide to an end concentration of 10 µM and by incubating at 20°C for 1 h and then re - solved by molecular sieve chromatography in MBB buffer . The unligated and 17E6 Fab – ligated ± cilengitide - treated forms of the 1TM -  V  3 com - plex were resolved unequivocally as discrete symmetrical peaks on the mo - lecular sieve column . The excess 17E6 Fab , eluting at Kav 0 . 52 , served as an internal standard . Each column run was repeated at least three times , and the mean and SDs for the Kav and elution volumes were calculated and compared using a Student’s t test . Crystallography , structure determination , and refinement 1TM -  V  3 was crystallized at 4°C by vapor diffusion using the hanging - drop method . The precipitating solution contained 12 % PEG 4K , 0 . 6 M NaCl , 5 mM CaCl 2 , and 0 . 1 M Na acetate at pH 5 . 5 . Hexagonal crystals grew over 4 – 5 d to dimensions of 0 . 3 × 0 . 4 × 0 . 15 mm 3 . A native x - ray diffraction dataset from a single cryocooled crystal was collected using the ID19 beamline fitted with a charge - coupled device detector at the Advanced Photon Source Facility . All data were indexed , integrated , and scaled with the HKL2000 program ( Otwinowski and Minor , 1997 ) . Data collection statistics are presented in Table I . The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of the ∆TM -  V  3 as the search model . The model was refined with the crystallography and NMR system ( CNS ; Brünger et al . , 1998 ) and manually adjusted with O ( Jones et al . , 1991 ) . After initial simulated annealing , the model was further refined with macromolecular refinement by the maximum - likelihood method ( REFMAC ; Winn et al . , 2001 ) . The complete structure of IE1 and - 2 , the linker between Materials and methods Construction , expression , and purification of 1TM -  V  3 We generated and cloned a new construct encoding human  V residues F1 - I967 and  3 residues G1 - V696 ( with each ending with the fourth putative TM residue , I967 and V696 of  V and  3 , respectively ; Fig . 1 A ) into the pacUW31vector , and the resulting 1TM -  V  3 pacUW31 vector was used to produce high titer recombinant 1TM -  V  3 virus , which was used to infect High - Five cells ( Invitrogen ; Mehta et al . , 1998 ) . To assess expression of the sol - uble recombinant integrin , sterile filtered supernatant was immunoprecipitated with the  V  3 heterodimer - specific antibody LM609 ( Cheresh and Spiro , 1987 ) conjugated to Affigel - 10 beads , and after extraction in SDS - PAGE sam - ple buffer , 200 - µl supernatant equivalents were run on 4 – 12 % gradient SDS gels under reducing and nonreducing conditions . After Western blotting , the membrane was blocked with skim milk – Tween and probed with mixed bio - tinylated 20H9 and 2A5 antibodies , directed against the  3 and  V subunits , respectively , before detection with anti – biotin - HRP and ECL visualization . 62 ng of purified ∆TM -  V  3 was run in parallel as a standard . The hetero - dimer could also be confirmed directly by capture ELISA using 17E6 ( anti -  V ) as capture reagent and AP3 ( anti -  3 ) as detection reagent . The 1TM -  V  3 re - ceptor was purified for biochemistry and crystallography as previously described for the ∆TM -  V  3 recombinant ( Mehta et al . , 1998 ) except that the mAb 14D9 ( Mitjans et al . , 1995 ) was used in affinity chromatography . Molecular sieve chromatography of purified 1TM -  V  3 All molecular sieve chromatography analyses were performed as previ - ously described ( Adair et al . , 2005 ) using precalibrated Superdex 200 ( 10 / 300 GL ) columns ( GE Healthcare ) on an Akta fast protein liquid chro - matography system ( GE Healthcare ) running Unicorn 5 . 01 software ( GE Healthcare ) at a flow rate of 0 . 4 ml min  1 at 20°C . The elution profiles were monitored in - line by UV adsorption at 280 nm . TBS buffer ( 145 mM NaCl and 25 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 ) containing either Ca and Mg ( 1 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM CaCl 2 ) or Mn ( 0 . 2 mM MnCl 2 ) was used throughout . 5 – 10 µg of purified ∆TM -  V  3 or 1TM -  V  3 was fractionated , and the Stokes radii were derived by substituting their peak elution volumes ( Ve ) in the fitted standard curve equation ( one - phase exponential fit ; Prism ; Graph - Pad Software , Inc . ) . Identity of resolved peaks was formally confirmed by SDS - PAGE and by ELISA using mAb LM609 . Plasmids and stable and transient transfections Plasmids containing cDNAs encoding WT human full - length  V and  3 were each subcloned in pcDNA3 .  - genu deletion (  - genu ; residues E 472 DYRPSQ 482 ) , R404A + R633A , and R633A +  CD ( residues D 672 - K 676 ) mutants in  3 and G989FF / GAA mutant in  V were made using PCR - based mutagenesis with the QuikChange kit ( Agilent Technologies ) , and authenticity was confirmed by DNA sequencing . Plasmids encoding WT human FN7 – 10 ( P1142 to T1509 ; provided by H . P . Erickson , Duke University Medical Center , Durham , NC ; Leahy et al . , 1996 ) , FN9 – 10 ( G1326 to T1509 ) , FN10 ( S1417 to T1509 ) , or the high affinity and  V  3 - specific form of FN10 ( Richards et al . , 2003 ) were expressed in bacteria and purified as described previously ( Aukhil et al . , 1993 ) . pcDNA3 plasmids encoding full - length WT  V and  3 were electroporated into K562 cells ( American Type Culture Collection ; Gupta et al . , 2007 ) . Stable K562 clones expressing WT  V  3 were maintained in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium plus 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum , 50 IU / ml penicillin and streptomycin , and 0 . 5 – 1 . 0 mg / ml G418 .  V or  3 mutant pcDNA3 plasmids were cotransfected with plasmids encod - ing the respective WT subunit into HEK 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Binding of 1TM -  V  3 to immobilized and soluble ligands Binding of increasing concentrations ( 0 . 001 – 10 µg / ml ) of soluble 1TM -  V  3 or ∆TM -  V  3 to immobilized purified FN type III domains 7 – 10 ( FN7 – 10 ; at 3 µg / ml ) was performed in the absence or presence of cyclic - RGD ( cyclo - [ Arg - Gly - Asp - d - Phe - ( N - Me ) Val ] - cilengitide ) or a control cyclic RAD peptide in 1 mM CaCl 2 + 1 mM MgCl 2 or 1 mM MnCl 2 ( in TBS ; 0 . 1 % BSA for 3 h at 37°C ; Kraft et al . , 1999 ) . Binding to uncoated wells was performed in parallel . The bound integrin was detected using biotinylated LM142 mAb ( Millipore ) at 2 µg / ml and 1 : 20 , 000 HRP - labeled anti - biotin antibody ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Binding of 1TM -  V  3 to soluble FN7 – 10 was also performed in solution ( Adair et al . , 2005 ) by mixing 1TM -  V  3 with FN7 – 10 ( in a 1 : 1 . 5 stoichiometric ratio ) or with native full - length FN ( in a 5 : 1 stoichiometric ratio ) for 1 h at 37°C in 145 mM NaCl and 25 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , buffer ( TBS ) containing 0 . 2 mM MnCl 2 or 1 mM CaCl 2 and 1 mM MgCl 2 . The presence of the 1TM -  V  3 – FN7 – 10 complex was de - tected after molecular sieve chromatography , 8 % SDS - PAGE analysis , and 599 CRYSTAL STRUCTURE 1TM -  V  3 • Xiong et al . NaCl ( TBS ) containing 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM CaCl 2 and 1 mM MgCl 2 , or 1 mM MnCl 2 for 20 min at 37°C . After two washes , some cells were labeled with 6 – 12 µM FM4 - 64 FX ( FM ) in TBS containing 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM CaCl 2 and 1 mM MgCl 2 , or 1 mM MnCl 2 for 5 min on ice , washed once , immediately fixed with ice - cold 4 % paraformaldehyde , washed , and mounted with GVA mount ( Invitrogen ) under a coverslip . The GVA - mounted slides were kept in the dark and used the next day for FLIM acquisition ( Bacskai et al . , 2003 ) . In some experiments , adherent K562 expressing WT  V  3 were pre - incubated with saturating amounts ( 10 µg / ml ) of unlabeled high affinity FN10 followed by the addition of Alexa Fluor 488 – Fab and then processed as in the previous section . FLIM measurements were made on a two - photon microscope ( Radi - ance 2000 ; Bio - Rad Laboratories ) with a femtosecond - pulsed Ti : Sapphire Laser ( Mai Tai ; Spectra - Physics ) at 800 - nm excitation . Photons were detected by microchannel plate photomultiplier tube ( MCP R3809 ; Hamamatsu Pho - tonics ) with time - correlated single photon counting ( SPC830 ; Becker & Hickl ) to measure fluorescent decay profiles . Decay curves were best fit into mono - exponential curves using SPCImage software ( version 2 . 6 . 1 . 2711 ; Becker & Hickl ) . Lifetimes for multiple cells ( n = 9 – 14 ) for each experimental condition were compared and evaluated for statistically significant differences from control cells ( labeled only with donor fluorophore ) by analysis of variance with Fisher’s post - hoc correction . Percent lifetime decrease , or FRET efficiency ( E ) , was calculated as the difference between the excited state of the donor in absence of acceptor (  D ) and in presence of acceptor fluorophore (  DA ) ac - cording to the equation E = 1   DA /  D . The distance between donor ( Fab ) and acceptor fluorophores , r , was calculated using the following equation ( Duncan et al . , 2004 ) : r = R 0 (  D /  DA  1 )  1 / 6 , where R 0 is the Förster radius , the distance at which energy transfer is 50 % . We assumed random orienta - tion for the fluorophore ( orientation factor ,  2 = 2 / 3 ) in the Fab molecule . We approximated R 0 as 62 Å based on spectral similarities to the published Alexa Fluor 488 – Alexa Fluor 568 pair ( Invitrogen ) . Online supplemental material Fig .

The final model converged to an R work value of 0 . 24 and R free value of 0 . 28 ( calculated with 5 % of reflections omitted from refinement ) . 97 % of the residues from the model fall into favorable or allowed regions of the Ramachandran diagram using the PROCHECK software in CCP4 ( Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 , 1994 ) . Fluorescent labeling of 17E6 Fab and FN The Fab fragment of the  V - specific mAb 17E6 ( Mitjans et al . , 1995 ) was prepared by papain digestion followed by anion exchange and size - exclusion chromatography ( Andrew , 2002 ) , and its purity was confirmed by SDS - PAGE followed by Coomassie staining . Fab 17E6 and high affinity  V  3 - specific FN10 were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 N - hydroxysuccin - imidyl ester dye using the Alexa Fluor 488 protein labeling kit ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The final antibody and FN con - centrations and the dye to protein molar ratios ( F / P ) were determined spec - trophotometrically , giving F / P molar ratios of  3 – 7 ( for Fab ) and  1 ( for FN9 – 10 and FN10 ; FN9 has no lysines ) . Binding of the fluorophore - labeled FN to  V  3 - expressing cells was evaluated by flow cytometry , and dose – response curves were established to determine the optimal ( saturating or subsaturating ) concentration of ligand used in subsequent experiments . Time - correlated single photon counting – FLIM acquisition and analysis Wells of nonfluorescent Labtek II four - chamber microscope slides ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) were coated with poly - l - Lys ( Sigma - Aldrich ) overnight at 4°C . 25 , 000 – 50 , 000  V  3 - expressing K562 or HEK 293T cells were trans - ferred in serum - free Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium to each well and incubated for 30 min at 37°C in a total volume of 200 µl . Nonspecific sites were blocked by incubation with 10 % serum - rich medium for 10 min at RT and then washed twice to remove nonadherent cells . Adherent live cells were stained with 20 µg / ml 17E6 labeled with the fluorescence donor Alexa Fluor 488 ( Alexa Fluor 488 – Fab ) in 25 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , and 145 mM Table I .
