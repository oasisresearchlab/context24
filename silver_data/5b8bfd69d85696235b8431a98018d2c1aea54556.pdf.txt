We recently discovered that incorporation of four - membered azetidine rings into classic fluorophore structures elicits substantial increases in brightness and photostability , resulting in the Janelia Fluor ( JF ) series of dyes . We refined and extended this strategy , finding that incorporation of 3 - substituted azetidine groups allows rational tuning of the spectral and chemical properties of rhodamine dyes with unprecedented precision . this strategy allowed us to establish principles for fine - tuning the properties of fluorophores and to develop a palette of new fluorescent and fluorogenic labels with excitation ranging from blue to the far - red . our results demonstrate the versatility of these new dyes in cells , tissues and animals . Small molecule fluorophores are essential tools for biochemi - cal and biological imaging 1 , 2 . The development of new labeling strategies 3 and innovative microscopy techniques 4 is driving the need for new fluorophores with specific properties . A particu - larly useful class of dyes is the rhodamines , first reported in 1887 ( ref . 5 ) and now used extensively because of the superb bright - ness and excellent photostability of this fluorophore scaffold 1 , 2 , 6 . The photophysical and chemical properties of rhodamines can be modified through chemical substitution 6 – 14 , allowing the crea - tion of fluorescent and fluorogenic labels , indicators and stains in different colors 7 , 11 – 20 . Despite a century of work on this dye class , the design and synthesis of new rhodamines remains severely limited by chemistry . The classic method of rhodamine synthesis—acid - catalyzed condensation 2 , 5 , 6 —is incompatible with all but the simplest functional groups . To remedy this long - standing problem , our laboratory developed a method to synthesize rhodamine dyes using a Pd - catalyzed cross - coupling strategy starting from simple fluorescein deriva - tives 21 . This approach facilitated the discovery of a previously unknown class of dyes containing four - membered azetidine rings , which exhibit substantial increases in the quantum yield relative to classic rhodamines containing N , N - dimethylamino A general method to fine - tune fluorophores for live - cell and in vivo imaging Jonathan B Grimm , Anand K Muthusamy , Yajie Liang , Timothy A Brown , William C Lemon , Ronak Patel , Rongwen Lu , John J Macklin , Philipp J Keller , Na Ji & Luke D Lavis groups 13 . The flagship member of this new dye class is Janelia Fluor 549 ( JF 549 , 1 ; Fig . 1a ) . The enhanced brightness and photo - stability of this rhodamine dye has made it an exceptionally useful label for single - molecule experiments in living cells 13 , 22 – 25 ; the recent development of a photoactivatable derivative has further extended its utility in advanced imaging experiments 26 . An important feature of rhodamine dyes is the ability to tune the spectral and chemical properties using chemistry 13 . JF 549 ( 1 ; Fig . 1a and Table 1 ) absorbs green light ( λ abs / λ em = 549 nm / 571 nm , absolute fluorescence quantum yield value ( Φ ) = 0 . 88 ) , mak - ing it an excellent match for light sources centered near 550 nm . Replacing the xanthene oxygen in JF 549 ( 1 ) with a quaternary carbon yields carborhodamine Janelia Fluor 608 ( JF 608 , 2 ) , with an expected 8 59 - nm shift in spectral properties ( λ abs / λ em = 608 nm / 631 nm , Φ = 0 . 67 ) . A larger red - shift can be achieved using the established Si - rhodamine strategy 10 , 12 to yield Janelia Fluor 646 ( JF 646 , 3 , λ abs / λ em = 646 nm / 664 nm , Φ = 0 . 54 ) . Finally , a shift to shorter wavelengths can be imposed by replacing one azetidine group in JF 549 ( 1 ) with an oxygen atom to yield rhodol 27 Janelia Fluor 519 ( JF 519 , 4 , λ abs / λ em = 519 nm / 546 nm , Φ = 0 . 85 ) . In addition to large shifts in λ abs and λ em , these modifications modulate the equilibrium between the colorless , nonfluorescent , ‘closed’ lactone ( L ) form and the colored , fluorescent , ‘open’ zwit - terionic ( Z ) form . Rhodamine JF 549 ( 1 , ε = 1 . 01 × 10 5 M −1 cm −1 ) , carborhodamine JF 608 ( 2 , ε = 9 . 9 × 10 4 M −1 cm −1 ) and rhodol JF 519 ( 4 , ε = 5 . 9 × 10 4 M −1 cm −1 ) primarily adopt the open , zwitte - rionic form in water , as evidenced by their large extinction coeffi - cients ( ε ; Table 1 ) . In contrast , JF 646 ( 3 ) predominantly adopts the colorless , nonfluorescent and lipophilic lactone form in aqueous solution ( ε = 5 . 0 × 10 3 M −1 cm −1 ) . The shifted L - Z equilibrium of JF 646 and other Si - rhodamines renders these dyes highly cell permeable as well as chromogenic and fluorogenic , where the change in chemical environment after binding of dye ligands to a variety of biomolecular targets can shift the equilibrium to the fluorescent zwitterionic form 12 – 14 , 18 . The strategies described above allow only ‘coarse’ tuning of spectral and chemical attributes : spectral shifts > 30 nm and substan - tial changes in L - Z equilibrium and absorptivity .

The use of 3 - substituted azetidines on the Janelia Fluor 549 ( 1 ) scaffold allows modulation of λ abs , λ em and the L - Z equilibrium with - out affecting fluorescence quantum yield . The shifts in chemical and spectral properties can be explained using physical organic chemistry principles and computational chemistry . The structure - activity relationships that we determined for rhodamine dyes were generalizable to related structures , allowing the rational design of four new fluorophores aligned with standard laser excitation sources across the visible spectrum : rhodol JF 503 , rhodamine JF 525 , carborhodamine JF 585 and Si - rhodamine JF 635 . These dyes exhibited improved properties for cellular imaging and could be extended to applications in tissue or in vivo . resultsFine - tuning rhodamines : Janelia Fluor 525 We reasoned that we could finely tune the physicochemical prop - erties of JF 549 ( 1 ) by exploring different substitution patterns on the azetidine ring . Indeed , the azetidinyl - rhodamine system provides an ideal test case for N - substituent effects because of the high - yielding Pd - catalyzed cross - coupling synthesis 21 ; the commercial availability of assorted 3 - substituted azetidines ; the short , three - bond separation between the substituent and the rhodamine aniline nitrogen ; and the symmetry of the system . We hypothesized that electron - withdrawing groups would decrease the λ abs of the fluorophore and shift the L - Z equilibrium toward the closed , colorless lactone form based on initial computational chemistry experiments ( Fig . 1b and Online Methods ) and reports of fluoroalkane - substituted rhodamine dyes 19 , 28 . To test these predictions , we synthesized compounds 5 – 12 ( Fig . 1a and Table 1 ) using our Pd - catalyzed cross - coupling approach 13 , 21 . We then evaluated the photophysical properties of compounds 5 – 12 in aqueous solution , comparing them with JF 549 ( 1 ; Table 1 ) . All of the substituted azetidinyl dyes showed high ε values above 1 × 10 5 M −1 cm −1 except for the 3 , 3 - difluoroazeti - dine compound 12 , which exhibited a slightly lower absorptivity ( ε = 9 . 4 × 10 4 M −1 cm −1 ) . Similarly , the quantum yield values of the azetidine dyes 5 – 12 were all > 0 . 80 , with the exception of the N , N - dimethyl - azetidin - 3 - amine compound 8 , which showed Φ = 0 . 57 at pH 7 . 4 . The quantum yield value for 8 was rescued at pH 5 . 0 ( Φ = 0 . 89 ; Table 1 ) , which is suggestive of photoinduced electron transfer ( PeT ) quenching by the unprotonated dimethylamino groups 29 . Although the ε and Φ of the different azetidinyl - rhodamine dyes was largely immune to substitution at the 3 - position , the λ abs and λ em values were strongly affected by the nature of the substituent ( Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Groups with greater electron - withdrawing character elicited larger hypso - chromic shifts in λ abs . This effect was additive . For example , the 3 - fluoroazetidinyl compound 10 showed a 13 - nm blue shift ( λ abs = 536 nm ) relative to the parent dye ( 1 ) , and the 3 , 3 - difluoroaze - tidinyl - rhodamine ( 12 ) showed a further hypsochromic shift of 11 nm ( λ abs = 525 nm ) . We plotted λ abs against the available Hammett inductive substituent constants ( σ I ) 30 for the azetidine substituents in dyes 1 , 5 and 8 – 12 and observed an excellent cor - relation ( Fig . 1c ) , suggesting that the inductive effect of the sub - stituents was primarily responsible for the decrease in absorption and emission maxima . The experimental λ abs values also showed excellent agreement with calculated λ abs values ( Fig . 1b ) . We then analyzed how the azetidine substitutions can tune the L - Z equilibrium ( Fig . 1d ) , first examining the absorbance of fluorophores 1 , 5 and 9 – 12 as a function of dielectric constant using dioxane - water titrations 11 , 16 ( Fig . 1e ) ; compounds 6 – 8 were not examined as a result of the ionizable substituents on the azetidine ring . On the basis of these data , we determined the equilibrium constant ( K L - Z ) 31 in 1 : 1 dioxane : water , which gave the largest distribution of absorbance measurements ( Fig . 1f ) , and therefore K L - Z values ( Fig . 1d and Table 1 ) . We determined these equilibrium values from the maximal extinction coefficients ( ε max ) measured in acidic alcohol solutions ( Table 1 and Online Methods ) . JF 549 ( 1 ) and the 3 , 3 - dimethylazetidinyl - rhodamine ( 5 ) showed K L - Z values > 3 , indicating that these dyes exist prima - rily in the open form . In contrast , the equilibrium constant of the 3 , 3 - difluoroazetidinyl - rhodamine ( 12 ) was substantially smaller ( K L - Z = 0 . 068 ) , suggesting that the electron - withdrawing fluorine substituents can shift the equilibrium toward the closed lactone form . The remainder of the dyes exhibited K L - Z values that were intermediate and correlated with σ I ( Fig . 1g ) . Collectively , these results yield rational and general rules for tuning both λ abs and the L - Z equilibrium using different 3 - substituted azetidines without compromising fluorophore brightness . Rhodamine 12 exhibited λ abs at 525 nm and a high quantum yield ( Φ = 0 . 91 ) , making it a useful label for imaging with blue - green excitation ( 514 – 532 nm ) . On the basis of the λ abs , we named this fluorophore Janelia Fluor 525 ( JF 525 ) and prepared the JF 525 - HaloTag 32 ligand ( 13 ; Fig . 1h ) , which showed excellent labeling in live cells expressing histone H2B - HaloTag fusions ( Fig . 1i ) . We posited that the JF 525 - HaloTag ligand ( 13 ) would show improved cell permeability relative to the parent JF 549 - HaloTag ligand ( 14 ; Fig . 1h ) based on its higher propensity to adopt the lactone form ( Fig . 1d – f and Table 1 ) . We compared the labeling efficiency of 13 or JF 549 - HaloTag ligand 14 in live cells expressing HaloTag - histone H2B fusions ( Online Methods ) . Compound 13 labeled intracellu - lar proteins faster than JF 549 ligand 14 ( Fig . 1j ) . These results sup - port the hypothesis that shifting the L - Z equilibrium toward the lactone form can improve cell permeability . We also synthesized the JF 525 - SNAP - tag ligand 15 , which was useful for intracellular labeling ( Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) , validating JF 525 as the first cell - permeable self - labeling tag ligand with an excitation maxi - mum near 532 nm . None of the reported HaloTag or SNAP - tag ligands showed acute cellular toxicity at standard labeling concen - trations and incubation times ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) Fine - tuning rhodols : Janelia Fluor 503 Since fluorine is the most electronegative atom , the difluoroaze - tidine - containing JF 525 ( 12 ) represents the tuning limit of the azetidinyl - rhodamines toward the blue region of the spectrum . To access shorter wavelength dyes , we turned to the rhodol Janelia Fluor 519 ( 4 ; Figs . 1a and 2a ) . On the basis of the tuning rules that we determined for the rhodamine dyes ( Fig . 1a ) , we sur - mised that replacement of the single azetidine substituent with a 3 , 3 - difluoroazetidine could elicit a desirable ~ 15 - nm blue - shift to yield a dye with maximal absorption closer to 488 nm . To test this hypothesis , we synthesized the 3 , 3 - difluoroazetidinyl - rhodol 16 , which showed the expected blue - shifted spectra with λ abs / λ em = 503 nm / 529 nm , ε = 8 . 3 × 10 4 M −1 cm −1 and Φ = 0 . 87 ( Fig . 2a , Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) ; we named this compound Janelia Fluor 503 ( JF 503 ) . nAture methods | VOL . 14 NO . 10 | OCTOBER 2017 | 989 Articles We then synthesized the JF 503 - HaloTag ligand ( 17 ; Fig . 2b ) , which was an excellent label for histone H2B - HaloTag fusions in live cells ( Fig . 2c ) . We compared this label to two other 488 - nm - excited HaloTag ligands based on the classic rhodamine 110 ( λ abs / λ em = 497 nm / 520 nm , 18 ) and the recently described N , N ′ - bis ( 2 , 2 , 2 - trifluoroethyl ) rhodamine ( λ abs / λ em = 501 nm / 525 nm , 19 ; Supplementary Fig . 2d ) 19 . The cell - loading time course for these structurally distinct and relatively polar dyes was similar ( Supplementary Fig . 2e ) , but the JF 503 ligand showed higher photostability than the other two dyes in live cells ( Fig . 2d ) , consistent with previous reports comparing the photostability of rhodols to rhodamines 27 . JF 503 could be extended to the SNAP - tag labeling system with JF 503 - SNAP - tag ligand ( 20 ; Supplementary Fig . 2f , g ) . Fine - tuning carborhodamines : Janelia Fluor 585 Previously , we extended our Pd - catalyzed cross - coupling approach to carborhodamines 11 , resulting in the synthesis of JF 608 ( 2 ; Figs . 1a and 2e , and Table 1 ) 13 .

Nevertheless , this shift in the L - Z equilibrium is not sufficient to achieve fluorogenic ligands and its relatively long λ abs value makes JF 608 suboptimal for multicolor cellular imaging experiments using orange ( 589 nm ) and red ( 640 nm ) excitation . Based on the rhodamine tuning ( Fig . 1a ) , we expected that incorporation of a 3 , 3 - difluoroazetidine would elicit a blue - shift of approximately 24 nm , bringing the λ abs closer to the desired excitation wave - lengths . We were also curious whether this modification would create a fluorogenic label given that , in the rhodamine series , the 3 , 3 - difluoroazetidine motif decreased the K L - Z by nearly two log units ( Fig . 1d ) . Given the linear relationship between log K L - Z and σ I ( Fig . 1g ) we reasoned that this substitution should tune the equilibrium of JF 608 ( 2 , K L - Z = 0 . 091 ) closer to the fluorogenic JF 646 ( 3 , K L - Z = 0 . 0012 ; Table 1 ) . We note previous efforts to shift the L - Z equilibrium of carborhodamines using direct fluorination produced a HaloTag ligand with modest , nine - fold fluorogenicity , but also severely decreased quantum yield 19 . On the basis of the general trend to higher Φ values following incorporation of elec - tron - withdrawing substituents in both rhodamines and rhodols ( Table 1 ) , we expected that substitution with fluorine atoms on the 3 - position of azetidine would also increase quantum yield of carborhodamines . To test these predictions , we synthesized the 3 , 3 - difluoroazetidi - nyl - carborhodamine ( 21 ) , which showed the expected blue - shift in spectra ( λ abs / λ em = 585 nm / 609 nm ) and increase in quantum yield ( Φ = 0 . 78 ; Fig . 2e , Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Based on these properties the dye was named ‘Janelia Fluor 585’ ( JF 585 ) . As predicted , JF 585 ( 21 ) also exhibited low visible absorption in water ( ε = 1 . 5 × 10 3 M −1 cm −1 ) and a K L - Z near zero ( Table 1 ) . We then evaluated these carborhodamines as biomolecule labels , preparing JF 608 - HaloTag ligand ( 22 ) and JF 585 - HaloTag ligand ( 23 ; Fig . 2f ) 11 , 13 , 21 .

JF 608 - HaloTag ligand ( 22 ) showed only an 11 % increase in absorp - tion following reaction with the HaloTag protein , but JF 585 ligand 23 showed a substantially higher absorbance increase of 80 - fold ( Fig . 2g ) . We then evaluated these dyes in ‘no wash’ cellular imaging experiments . Incubation of JF 608 - HaloTag ligand ( 22 , 250 nM ) with cells expressing histone H2B - HaloTag showed excellent nuclear labeling , but high background , as a result of the free ligand staining internal membrane structures ( Fig . 2h ) . In contrast , cells that were incubated with 250 nM of JF 585 - HaloTag ligand 23 and imaged directly showed bright nuclei with low fluorescence background ( Fig . 2i ) . The JF 585 - SNAP - tag ligand ( 24 ) also functioned as a cellu - lar label ( Supplementary Fig . 2h , i ) , and the orange JF 585 - HaloTag ligand ( 23 ) could be used in three - color experiments with the green JF 503 - SNAP - tag ligand ( 20 ) and our previously described red JF 646 - Hoechst stain 33 ( Supplementary Fig . 2j ) . Fine - tuning si - rhodamines : Janelia Fluor 635 Having success in applying these tuning rules to rhodol and car - borhodamine dyes , we then turned to the Si - rhodamine JF 646 ( 3 ; Figs . 1a and 2j ) 13 . We anticipated that addition of a single fluorine atom on each azetidine ring would elicit a ~ 13 - nm hyp - sochromic shift and further decrease K L - Z , yielding a dye with a λ abs near 633 nm and higher degree of fluorogenicity . True to this prediction , the synthesis of the desired fluorinated derivative 25 ( Fig . 2j ) afforded a dye that showed λ abs / λ em = 635 nm / 652 nm and a slightly higher Φ = 0 . 56 relative to JF 646 ( 3 ) .

We call this dye Janelia Fluor 635 ( JF 635 ) . Analogous to the experiments with JF 608 and JF 585 , we synthe - sized the JF 635 - HaloTag ligand ( 27 ) and compared it with the JF 646 ligand 26 ( Fig . 2k ) . As reported previously 13 , ligand 26 showed a 21 - fold increase in absorbance following binding to the HaloTag protein ( Fig . 2l ) . The shifted L - Z equilibrium of JF 635 caused HaloTag ligand 27 to show exceptionally low background and a 113 - fold increase in absorbance following conjugation ( Fig . 2l ) . Both of these absorbance increases were substantially larger than the previously published SiTMR ligand 28 ( Supplementary Fig . 2k ) , which showed a 6 . 7 - fold increase in absorption following reac - tion with the HaloTag protein 12 , 13 . These in vitro results were mirrored in no - wash cellular imaging experiments , in which we incubated cells expressing histone H2B - HaloTag fusions with 250 nM ligands 26 – 28 . JF 646 ligand 26 ( Fig . 2m ) and JF 635 ligand 27 ( Fig . 2n ) exhibited substantially lower nonspecific extranu - clear fluorescence than the SiTMR compound 28 ( Supplementary Fig . 2l ) , with JF 635 showing the highest contrast . The SNAP - tag ligand of JF 635 ( 29 ) effectively labeled SNAP - tag fusions in cells ( Supplementary Fig . 2m , n ) and the JF 635 - HaloTag ligand ( 27 ) could be used in a two - color experiment with JF 525 - SNAP - tag ligand ( 15 ; Supplementary Fig . 2o ) . Applications in tissue and in vivo The HaloTag ligands of tuned fluorophores Janelia Fluor 585 ( 23 ) and Janelia Fluor 635 ( 27 ) are small , cell permeable and exhibit high fluorogenicity following reaction with the HaloTag protein . We were curious whether these properties would make them useful for labeling in more complex biological environments such as tissue or whole animals . We first attempted labeling in living brain tissue from Drosophila larvae using the JF 635 - HaloTag ligand ( 27 ; Fig . 2k ) because of its far - red excitation ( Fig . 2j and Table 1 ) and high on : off ratio ( Fig . 2l , n ) . We used a Drosophila GAL4 line expressing myristoylated HaloTag protein in ‘Basin’ neurons , which project basin - shaped arbors into the ventral nerve cord ( VNC ) of the larval fly 34 . Explants from Drosophila third instar larvae were dissected , incubated briefly with 27 ( 1 µ M , 10 min ) and imaged using the SiMView light - sheet microscope 35 . As shown in the projection of the SiMView three - dimensional recon - struction , the JF 635 label exhibited consistent labeling throughout 800 1 , 000 1 , 200 0 1 , 000 2 , 000 3 , 000 Wavelength ( nm ) mCherry 1 , 100 nm 13 ( JF 525 ) 14 ( JF 549 ) 23 ( JF 585 ) 27 ( JF 635 ) 26 ( JF 646 ) 17 ( JF 503 ) 0 50 100 150 200 250 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 Time ( h ) J F 585 / G C a M P 6 f l uo r e sc en c e r a t i o ( a . u . ) a b b I n t en s i t y I n t en s i t y LBL RBL VNC BN BN BN c IV L5 IP L4 IP L5 IV L4 d – 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 ∆ F / F 0 4 3 2 1 0 2 , 000 60 40 20 e R O I f g Image frame ( 3 Hz ) GCaMP6 JF 585 Merge and ROIs 0 1 , 000 3 , 000 4 , 000 0 – 24 h – 2 h + 4 h + 27 h – 24 h – 2 h + 4 h + 27 h A v e r age ∆ F / F 0 ( % ) F l uo r e sc en c e ( kc p s ) Figure 3 | Labeling in tissue and in vivo .

We next evaluated the JF dyes in the brains of living mice . The JF 585 - HaloTag ligand 23 was chosen on the basis of its high fluorogenicity ( Fig . 2g , i ) and superior two - photon fluorescence at 1 , 100 - nm excitation ( Fig . 3c ) , which is sufficiently separated from GFP - based indicators such as GCaMP6 ( 2 - photon λ ex = 940 nm ) 36 to allow multicolor imaging . Cytosolic HaloTag protein was coexpressed in layer 4 or layer 5 visual cortex ( V1 ) neurons with GCaMP6s via viral transduction and the mice were fitted with a chronic cranial window ( Online Methods ) . Injection of 100 nmol of HaloTag ligand 23 into the tail vein ( intravenous , IV ) revealed that the JF 585 ligand was blood - brain - barrier - permeable and gave measureable labeling in the brain within 5 min , peaking around 6 h and lasting for nearly 2 weeks as measured by epifluorescence ( Fig . 3d and Supplementary Fig . 3d ) . Subsequent intraperitoneal ( IP ) injection into the same set of mice also showed effective deliv - ery to the brain , although with different pharmacokinetics in the early time points ( < 7 d ; Fig . 3d ) . Under two - photon imaging , we observed that the GCaMP6s and JF 585 signals colocalized ( Fig . 3e , Supplementary Fig . 3e and Supplementary Video 1 ) , and the labeling showed no significant effect on spontaneous neuronal activity ( Fig . 3f , g ) , establishing the utility of this fluorophore and labeling strategy in vivo . discussion Despite the broad utility of rhodamines , methods to modulate the physicochemical properties of this dye class are relatively coarse and empirical . We developed a method that allows rational fine - tuning of fluorophore properties for specific biological applica - tions . We first determined the tuning rules in the rhodamine system by synthesizing a panel of rhodamine variants using the bright and photostable JF 549 scaffold ( Fig . 1a ) . This resulted in the development of JF 525 ( 12 ) and its derivatives 13 and 15 , which constitute the first ligands for self - labeling tags with absorption maxima near 532 nm . The tuning rules that we discovered are generalizable to other fluorophore classes—rhodols , carborhod - amines and Si - rhodamines—allowing the rational design of finely tuned fluorophores such as JF 503 ( 16 ; Fig . 2a ) , JF 585 ( 21 ; Fig . 2e ) and JF 635 ( 25 ; Fig . 2j ) . Together with JF 549 ( 1 ) and JF 646 ( 3 ; Fig . 1a ) 13 , we have now described six dyes that span the visible region of the spectrum and match common excitation wavelengths for fluorescence microscopy . These bright fluorophores can be used immediately for structured illumination and stimulated emission depletion imaging and could be converted to photoac - tivatable derivatives 26 for single - molecule localization micros - copy experiments . Our general rules should allow fine - tuning of a variety of fluorescent reagents , including classic fluorophores 13 , emerging red - shifted rhodamine variants 37 and fluorogenic ligands 12 , 14 , 18 , 19 , 33 , to further extend the range of bright fluorophores useful for fluorescence microscopy . Notably , the new HaloTag ligands derived from JF 585 and JF 635 showed a high degree of chro - mogenicity and fluorogenicity ( Fig . 2g , i , l , n ) , a critical parameter in advanced imaging experiments 38 . Of particular interest is the ability to deliver these dyes to neural tissue in explants ( Fig . 3a , b ) or whole animals ( Fig . 3d – g ) , which could allow the imaging of deeper structures in the brain or the in situ assembly of semisyn - thetic indicators for monitoring cellular activity 3 . Although we focused on the fluorine - substituted azetidines , the other substitutions ( Fig . 1a ) could be exploited to prepare fluoro - phores for specific applications . For example , the carboxy groups in compounds 6 and 7 could serve as attachment sites for a variety of chemical modifiers to improve solubility 7 , quench unwanted triplet states 39 or to allow the molecule to serve as a multivalent fluorescent cross - linker . The modest pH sensitivity and presence of the basic amine in compound 8 could allow it to function as a pH sensor or stain for lysosomes . The methoxy group on compound 9 could be elaborated to a polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) or another solubilizing group . Finally , the cyano group in compound 11 could be used in multimodal regimes in which both fluorescence and Raman 40 modalities are used for imaging . In all , this general method to rationally tune photophysical and chemical properties against a backdrop of high quantum yield will allow the precise design of many new fluorophores for specific , sophisticated biological imaging experiments in increasingly complex systems . methods Methods , including statements of data availability and any associ - ated accession codes and references , are available in the online version of the paper .

Methods for chemical synthesis and full characterization of all novel compounds can be found in the Supplementary Note . UV - vis and fluorescence spectroscopy . Fluorescent and fluoro - genic molecules for spectroscopy were prepared as stock solutions in DMSO and diluted such that the DMSO concentration did not exceed 1 % ( vol / vol ) . Spectroscopy was performed using 1 - cm path length , 3 . 5 - ml quartz cuvettes or 1 - cm path length , 1 . 0 - ml quartz microcuvettes from Starna Cells . All measurements were taken at ambient temperature ( 22 ± 2 °C ) . Absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary Model 100 spectrometer ( Agilent ) . Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Cary Eclipse fluorom - eter ( Varian ) . Maximum absorption wavelength ( λ abs ) , extinction coefficient ( ε ) , and maximum emission wavelength ( λ em ) were taken in 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 3 buffer unless otherwise noted ; reported values for ε are averages ( n = 3 ) . Normalized spectra are shown for clarity . Determination K L - Z and ε max . To determine K L - Z we first performed dioxane - H 2 O titrations in spectral grade dioxane ( Aldrich ) and milliQ H 2 O ( Fig . 1e ) . The solvent mixtures contained 0 . 01 % ( vol / vol ) triethylamine to ensure the rhodamine dyes were in the zwitterionic form . The absorbance values at λ abs were measured on 5 µ M samples ( n = 4 ) using a quartz 96 - well microplate ( Hellma ) and a FlexStation3 microplate reader ( Molecular Devices ) . Values of dielectric constant ( ε r ) were as previously reported 41 . We then calculated K L - Z using the following equation 31 : K L - Z = ( ε dw / ε max ) / ( 1 − ε dw / ε max ) . ε dw is the extinction coefficient of the dyes in a 1 : 1 ( vol / vol ) dioxane : water solvent mixture ( Fig . 1f ) ; this dioxane - water mixture was chosen to give the maximum spread of K L - Z values ( Fig . 1e ) . ε max is the maximal extinction coefficients measured in different solvent mixtures depending on dye type : 0 . 1 % ( vol / vol ) trifluoroacetic acid ( TFA ) in 2 , 2 , 2 - trifluoroethanol ( TFE ) for the rhodamines ( 1 , 5 – 12 ) and carborhodamines ( 2 , 21 ) ; 0 . 1 % ( vol / vol ) TFA in ethanol for the Si - rhodamines ( 3 , 25 ) ; 0 . 01 % ( vol / vol ) Et 3 N in TFE for the rhodols ( 4 , 16 ) . Quantum yield determination . All reported absolute fluores - cence quantum yield values ( Φ ) were measured in our laboratory under identical conditions using a Quantaurus - QY spectrometer ( model C11374 , Hamamatsu ) . This instrument uses an integrating sphere to determine photons absorbed and emitted by a sample . Measurements were carried out using dilute samples ( A < 0 . 1 ) and self - absorption corrections 42 were performed using the instru - ment software . Reported values are averages ( n = 3 ) . The quantum yield for compound 8 at pH 5 . 0 was taken in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer containing 150 mM NaCl . Computational chemistry . Computational experiments were per - formed using Gaussian 09 ( ref . 43 ) . DFT and TD - DFT methods were used to calculate the spectral properties of the azetidinyl - rhodamine compounds ( Fig . 1b ) . Calculations were performed at the B3LYP / 6 - 31 + G ( d , p ) / IEFPCM and TD - B3LYP / 6 - 31 + G ( d , p ) / IEFPCM theory levels for the ground states and excited states respectively . Frequency calculations confirmed that an energy minimum was found in geometry optimizations . Linear response solvation with the IEFPCM model was sufficient to study the excited state energies . Evaluations of TD - DFT theory have discussed the overestimation of excitation energies 44 , 45 , and previous studies of rhodamine excited states have reported using ~ 0 . 4 - eV correction to account for this overestimation 46 , 47 . We applied a consistent −0 . 4 - eV correction to the calculated excited state energies , which gave good agreement with spectroscopy experiments ( Fig . 1b ) . Measurement of increase in absorbance of HaloTag ligands 22 , 23 , 26 – 28 following attachment with HaloTag protein . HaloTag protein used as a 100 µ M solution in 75 mM NaCl , 50 mM TRIS·HCl , pH 7 . 4 with 50 % v / v glycerol ( TBS – glycerol ) . Absorbance measurements were performed in 1 . 0 - ml quartz cuvettes . HaloTag ligands 22 , 23 , 26 – 28 ( 5 µ M ) were dissolved in 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 3 containing 0 . 1 mg ml −1 CHAPS . An aliquot of HaloTag protein ( 1 . 5 equiv ) or an equivalent volume of TBS – glycerol blank was added and the resulting mixture was incubated until consistent absorbance signal was observed ( ~ 60 min ) . Absorbance scans are averages ( n = 2 ) . Multiphoton spectroscopy . HaloTag ligands 13 , 14 , 17 , 23 , 26 and 27 ( 5 µ M ) were incubated with excess purified HaloTag pro - tein ( 1 . 5 equiv ) in 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 3 containing 0 . 1 mg·ml −1 CHAPS as above and incubated for 24 h at 4 °C . These solutions were then diluted to 1 µ M in 10 mM HEPES buffer , pH 7 . 3 and the two - photon excitation spectra were measured as previously described 48 , 49 . Briefly , measurements were taken on an inverted microscope ( IX81 , Olympus ) equipped with a 60× , 1 . 2 NA water objective ( Olympus ) . Dye – protein samples were excited with pulses from an 80 MHz Ti - Sapphire laser ( Chameleon Ultra II , Coherent ) for 710 - 1080 nm and with an OPO ( Chameleon Compact OPO , Coherent ) for 1 , 000 – 1 , 300 nm . Fluorescence collected by the objective was passed through a dichroic filter ( 675DCSXR , Omega ) and a short pass filter ( 720SP , Semrock ) and detected by a fiber - coupled Avalanche Photodiode ( SPCM _ AQRH - 14 , PerkinElmer ) . For reference , a two - photon excitation spectrum was also obtained for the red fluorescent protein mCherry ( 1 µ M ) , in the same HEPES buffer . All excitation spectra are corrected for the wavelength - dependent trans - mission of the dichroic and band - pass filters , and quantum efficiency of the detector . General cell culture and fluorescence microscopy . COS7 and U2OS cells ( ATCC ) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium ( DMEM , phenol red - free ; Life Technologies ) sup - plemented with 10 % ( vol / vol ) FBS ( Life Technologies ) , 1 mM GlutaMAX ( Life Technologies ) and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5 % ( vol / vol ) CO 2 environment . The COS7 cells have integrated a histone H2B - HaloTag expressing plasmid via the piggyback transposase ( that is , H2B - Halo cells ) , and the U2OS cells have integrated a Sec61 β - HaloTag expressing plasmid via the piggyback transposase . Both cells were kept under the selection of 500 µ g / ml Geneticin ( Life Technologies ) . Cell lines undergoes regular mycoplasma testing by the Janelia Cell Culture Facility . Cells were imaged on confocal microscopes in the Janelia Imaging Facility ( Zeiss LSM 710 , W Plan APO 20× / 1 . 8 D - or - Zeiss LSM 880 , C - APO 40 × / 1 . 2 W Corr FCS M27 ) using the indicated filter sets . doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 4403 nAture methods Comparison of JF 549 and JF 525 . For the dye loading comparison ( Fig . 1j ) , H2B - Halo COS7 cells were stained for varying amounts of time with 100 nM of either JF 525 - HaloTag ligand 13 or JF 549 - HaloTag ligand 14 . The dye was washed from the cells and subse - quently labeled with JF 646 – HaloTag ligand 26 at 1 µ M for 30 min . Fluorescence of JF 646 - HaloTag ligand was quantified from the nuclear signals in summed confocal image stacks collected with 633 nm Ex / 638 – 759 nm Em and analyzed using Fiji 50 . The inte - grated density of the nuclear signal was corrected by subtracting the integrated density of adjacent background regions . Labeling is expressed as the percent of the JF 646 - HaloTag fluorescence displaced by the JF 525 - and JF 549 - HaloTag ligands . The nuclear staining of these cells by the JF 525 - HaloTag ligand ( Fig . 1i ) is displayed as a maximum intensity projection of confocal image stacks , 514 nm Ex / 530 – 657 Em . Comparison of JF 503 and other 488 - nm - excited dyes . H2B - Halo COS7 cells were labeled with 200 nM of JF 503 - HaloTag ligand 17 , HaloTag R110Direct ligand ( 18 , Promega ) , or HaloTag ligand 19 ( ref . 28 ) , over a time course of 0 – 2 h . Cells were washed 2× with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and fixed with 4 % ( wt / vol ) paraformaldehyde in 0 . 1 M phosphate for 30 min , followed by two more washes with PBS . Cells were imaged using confocal microscopy with 488 nm Ex / 515 – 565 nm Em . The nuclear staining of these cells by the JF 503 – HaloTag ligand ( 17 ; Fig . 2c ) is displayed as a maximum intensity projec - tion of confocal image stacks . Corrected nuclear fluorescence was calculated as above to determine the cell loading profile ( Supplementary Fig . 2e ) . To test the relative bleaching rates of these three dyes under imaging conditions ( Fig . 2d ) , cells were stained and fixed as previously described for 2 h and then bleached with 488 nm at twice the typical excitation power and imaged after each of 70 cycles . Bleached fluorescence data are normalized to the initial fluorescence levels . Comparison of HaloTag ligands 22 , 23 and 26 – 28 in cells . H2B - Halo COS7 cells were labeled with 250 nM of JF 608 - HaloTag ligand ( 22 ) , JF 585 - HaloTag ligand ( 23 ) , JF 646 - HaloTag ligand ( 26 ) , JF 635 - HaloTag ligand ( 27 ) or SiTMR - HaloTag ligand ( 28 ; Supplementary Fig . 2k ) and imaged by confocal microscopy using 594 nm Ex / 599 – 734 nm Em ( JF 608 and JF 585 ) or 633 nm Ex / 638 – 759 nm Em ( JF 646 JF 635 , or SiTMR ) . All five samples were imaged via confocal microscopy without washing out the dyes . Signal to background ( S / B ) ratios were determined using the mean fluorescence of the nuclei relative to a region adjacent to each nuclei using Fiji 50 ( n = 152 – 275 areas as noted ; Fig . 2h , i , m , n and Supplementary Fig . 2l ) . Staining with SNAP - tag ligands . COS7 cells were transfected with histone H2B – pSNAP - tag ( New England Biolabs ) and sta - ble integration of this plasmid was selected for using 600 µ g / ml Geneticin ( Life Technologies ) . This cell line expresses the histone H2B protein fused to the 26m version of the SNAP - tag protein . Cells were stained with four different dyes as follows ; JF 503 - SNAP - tag ligand ( 20 , 2 µ M for 90 min ) , JF 525 - SNAP - tag ligand ( 15 , 3 µ M for 30 min ) , JF 585 - SNAP - tag ligand ( 24 , 2 µ M for 3 h with 0 . 2 % ( wt / vol ) Pluronic F - 127 ) , JF 635 - SNAP - tag ligand ( 29 , 2 µ M for 2 h with 0 . 2 % ( wt / vol ) Pluronic F - 127 ) . After staining , cells were washed three times with complete media , followed by a 20 - min incubation in a 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 , humidified incubator . The media was replaced again immediately before imaging . Multiplexed imaging using HaloTag and SNAP - tag . U2OS cells expressing Sec61 β - HaloTag fusion were transfected with either histone H2B - SNAP - tag piggybac orTOMM20 - pSNAPf plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 ( ThermoFisher ) . Sec61 β encodes an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein translocator protein , and TOMM20 encodes an outer mitochondrial membrane protein as part of a protein translocase complex . Live cells were simul - taneously stained with combinations of JF 503 - SNAP - tag ligand ( 20 , 1 µ M ) and JF 585 - HaloTag ligand ( 23 , 100 nM ; Supplementary Fig . 2j ) or JF 525 - SNAP - tag ligand ( 15 , 1 µ M ) and JF 635 - HaloTag ligand ( 27 , 100 nM , Supplementary Fig . 2o ) for 60 min . Cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( 20 min ) , and subse - quently stained with JF 646 - Hoechst 33 ( 5 µ M , 30 min ) , as indicated , before imaging . Cell viability assays . The effects of various Janelia Fluor ligand compounds on cell viability were tested using the tetrazolium dye 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT , Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . This colorimetric cell viability assay relies on NAD ( P ) H - dependent oxidoreductase enzymes that reduce the dye to an insoluble and highly absorbing forma - zan 51 . COS7 cells were plated at 1 . 5 × 10 4 cells per well of a 96 - well plate 24 h before the assay . Dyes were applied to cells at different concentrations to span standard labeling conditions in live cells ( n = 3 ) . HaloTag ligands 13 , 14 , 17 , 23 , 26 and 27 were applied for 1 h and SNAP - tag ligands 15 , 20 , 24 and 29 were applied for 3 h before addition of MTT to reflect typical maximum staining times for these dyes . Staining of Drosophila larvae . The CNS of third instar Drosophila melanogaster larvae were dissected in physiological saline . For the JF 635 - HaloTag ligand staining ( Fig . 3a , b and Supplementary Fig . 3a , c ) , we used larva expressing a previously described 52 HaloTag containing a myristoylation sequence in the ‘Basin’ neurons under control of the enhancer fragment R72F11 34 . The isolated nervous system was incubated in physiological saline containing 1 µ M JF 635 - HaloTag ligand ( 27 ) for 10 min at ambient temperature ( 22 ± 2 °C ) . For the pan - neuronal compari - son ( Supplementary Fig . 3b ) , this animal expressed GCaMP6s via the Gal4 / UAS system using a 57C10 - Gal4 driver line . The specimens were then embedded in agarose and imaged with the SiMView light - sheet microscope 35 . The VNC zoomed images for direct comparison ( Supplementary Fig . 3a , b ) show the raw image data after fusion and deconvolution , whereas the full image of JF 635 - HaloTag ligand labeling ( Fig . 3a , b , Supplementary Fig . 3c ) additionally uses filtering and gamma correction to show neuronal morphologies more clearly . General information for mouse in vivo experiments . Male mice , 3 – 8 months old , were used for viral infection , dye injection and in vivo imaging of neurons in the visual cortex ( V1 ) : the Scnn1a - Tg3 - Cre ( Jax no . 009613 ) line was used for imaging in layer 4 cortical neurons ( L4 ) ; and Rbp4 - Cre mice ( MMRRC no . 031125 - UCD ) were used for imaging in layer 4 cortical neurons ( L5 ) neu - rons . All experimental protocols were conducted according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal research doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 4403 nAture methods and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Janelia Research Campus , HHMI . Cranial window implant and virus injection . A craniotomy was carried out at the same time as the virus injection to provide optical access for in vivo imaging experiments . Mice were anes - thetized with isoflurane ( 1 – 2 % ( vol / vol ) in O 2 ) and given the anal - gesic buprenorphine ( SC , 0 . 3 mg / kg ) . Using aseptic technique , a 3 . 5 mm - diameter craniotomy was made over the left V1 region of the brain of anaesthetized mouse ( center : 3 . 4 mm posterior to Bregma ; 2 . 7 mm lateral from midline ) . The dura was left intact . HaloTag and GCaMP6s was cotranduced using the viral vector : AAV2 / 1 . synapsin . FLEX . GCaMP6s . P2A . HaloTag . WPRE ( ~ 5 × 10 12 infectious units per ml , 30 nl per site ) . The virus was injected using a glass pipette beveled at 45° with a 15 – 20 - µ m opening and back - filled with mineral oil . A fitted plunger controlled by a hydraulic manipulator ( Narashige , MO10 ) was inserted into the pipette and used to load and inject the solution into six sites of left V1 ( 3 . 4 – 4 . 4 mm posterior to Bregma ; 2 . 2 – 2 . 8 mm lateral from midline ; ~ 0 . 5 mm distance between each injection site , 0 . 5 mm below pia ) . A cranial window made of a single glass coverslip ( Fisher Scientific no . 1 . 5 ) was embedded in the craniotomy and sealed in place with dental acrylic . A titanium head - post was attached to the skull with cyanoacrylate glue and dental acrylic . Dye administration in vivo . JF 585 - HaloTag ligand ( 23 ) was first administered to mice 3 – 4 weeks after the cranial window instal - lation and viral injection . Dye solution was prepared by first dissolving 100 nmol ( 76 µ g ) of 23 in 20 µ l DMSO . After vortexing , 20 µ l of a Pluronic F - 127 solution ( 20 % ( wt / wt ) in DMSO ) was added and this stock solution was diluted into 100 µ l or 200 µ l sterile saline for IV ( tail vein ) or IP injection , respectively . In vivo wide - field imaging and analysis . Mice were head - fixed and awake during the imaging period and were therefor habitu - ated to experimental handling and head fixation starting 1 - week post - surgery . During each habituation session , mice were head - fixed onto the sample stage with body restrained under a half - cylindrical cover . The habituation procedure was repeated 3 – 4 times for each animal for a duration of 15 – 60 min . For in vivo wide - field imaging , an external fluorescence light source ( Leica EL6000 , Leica ) was used for excitation of GCaMP6s ( green chan - nel ) and JF 585 - HaloTag ligand ( red channel ) . Images were acquired via Leica Application Suite 4 . 5 ( Leica ) . Wide - field images in green ( 1 - s exposure ) and red ( 4 - s exposure ) channels were acquired at multiple time intervals over 2 weeks under the same imaging conditions and the images were aligned with the Stackreg plugin in ImageJ . The mean values in the same area of red and green channels were plotted to track the labeling kinetics and turnover of JF 585 - HaloTag in vivo . In vivo two - photon imaging and analysis . For in vivo two - photon imaging , GCaMP6s and JF 585 - HaloTag were excited at 940 nm and 1 , 100 nm , respectively , using a femtosecond laser source ( InSight DeepSee , Spectra - Physics ) , and imaged using an Olympus 25× , 1 . 05 NA objective and a homebuilt two - photon microscope 53 . Images were acquired from 200 to 550 µ m below the pia with post - objective power ranging between 20 and 60 mW . No photobleaching or photodamage of tissue was observed . Typical imaging settings were composed of 256 × 256 pixels , with 1 . 2 µ m per pixel , and a ~ 3 - Hz frame rate . The time - lapse calcium images of spontaneous neuronal activity in awake , head fixed mice were recorded and analyzed with custom programs written in MATLAB ( Mathworks ) . Lateral motion present in head - fixed awake mice was corrected using a cross - correlation - based reg - istration algorithm 54 , where cross - correlation was calculated to determine frame shift in x and y directions . Cortical neurons were outlined by hand as regions of interest ( ROIs ) . The fluorescence time course of each ROI was used to calculate its calcium transient as ∆ F / F ( % ) = ( F − F 0 ) / F 0 × 100 , with the baseline fluorescence F 0 being the mode of the fluorescence intensity histogram of this ROI . For the Pearson correlation coefficient calculation , the JF 585 ( red channel ) and GCaMP6s ( green channel ) fluorescence signals in each ROI were averages from 1 , 000 imaging frames ( 3 Hz ) . Statistics . For spectroscopy measurements ( Figs . 1e , f and 2g , l , Table 1 , and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) reported n values for absorp - tion spectra , extinction coefficient ( ε ) and quantum yield ( Φ ) represent measurements of different samples prepared from the same dye DMSO stock solution . For the cell loading experiment ( Fig . 1j ) the following reported n values represent the number of intensity values measured from three fields of view for the time points at 30 s , 1 min , 2 min , 3 min and 4 min , respectively : JF 525 - HaloTag ligand 13 : n = 112 , 120 , 130 , 114 , 128 ; JF 549 - HaloTag ligand 14 : n = 135 , 129 , 135 , 158 , 161 . For the reference stain using JF 646 - HaloTag ligand n = 248 . For cellular toxicity ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) assays , reported n values represent different cell culture samples in separate microplate wells . For the contrast measurements ( Fig . 2h , i , m , n and Supplementary Fig . 2l ) reported n values represent intensity values measured from three fields of view for each dye type . For the IV and IP experiments ( Fig . 3d ) , reported n = 3 values represent different fields of view taken via wide - field imaging . The one - way ANOVA analysis of spontaneous neuronal activity before and after dye administration ( Fig . 3g ) gave F ( 3 , 236 ) = 0 . 1204 . Data availability .
