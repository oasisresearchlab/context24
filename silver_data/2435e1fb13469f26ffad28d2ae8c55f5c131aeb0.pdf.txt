The aim of the paper is to introduce a novel algorithm for a case with insufficient information , that is the case when the number of available pairwise comparisons ranges from 1 to ( n − 2 ) . It is assumed that the comparisons are performed via the following two non - numerical binary relations : preference relation ( ≻ ) and indifference relation ( ∼ ) . The algorithm provides a probability of each possible ranking ( permutation ) of all compared objects based on the revealed pairwise comparisons , while missing comparisons are modeled via full enumeration of all feasible cases ( for a small number of objects ) , or via Monte Carlo simulations ( for a large number of objects ) . Index Terms —insufficient information , Monte Carlo method , pairwise comparisons , ranking I . I NTRODUCTION Pairwise comparisons ( PCs ) , that is comparisons of ( only ) two objects at a time , constitute a fundamental part of many multiple criteria decision / aiding methods such as the AHP / ANP , BWM , ELECTRE , MACBETH , PAPRIKA , or PROMETHEE , see e . g . [ 2 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , or [ 26 ] . As per standard ( see e . g . the AHP ) , ’cardinal / quantitative’ pairwise comparisons in the form of non - negative real numbers are applied to describe the relationships between pairs of objects . In the multiplicative pairwise comparisons the value of a AB is usually interpreted as “ A is a AB times preferred over B ” ( see e . g . [ 6 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 26 ] ) . Additive and fuzzy pairwise comparisons form another theoretical frameworks , where a AB means “ A is by a AB more preferred over B ” , or “ a unit interval is divided so that A is assigned the value of a AB and B gets ( 1 − a AB ) ” , respectively , see e . g . [ 3 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 14 ] , or [ 27 ] . When too complex or mostly subjective judgements are involved , providing cardinal relationship between two entities might be difficult , thus it is much more convenient to provide an ordinal / qualitative assessment in the form “ A is much better than B ” or “ A is only slightly better than A ” , etc . A com - prehensive theory of ordinal pairwise comparisons has been discussed in [ 1 ] , [ 12 ] – [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , or [ 18 ] . Instead of numerical values a AB , the binary relations ∼ , ⊏ , ⊂ , < , ≺ , interpreted Grant Agency of the Czech Republic as indifferent , slightly in favour of , in favour of , extremely better , or , in a simpler model , only a pair ≻ , ∼ interpreted as preference and indifference can be applied . Ordinal preferences are closely related to the concept of transitivity : if an object A is preferred over an object B , and B is preferred over an object C , then , naturally , A should be preferred over C . The transitive property is widely considered a cornerstone of rational decision theory , see e . g . [ 28 ] . When comparing n objects such as alternatives , criteria , etc . , there exists a total of n ( n − 1 ) 2 pairwise comparisons ( assuming reciprocity ) , while the minimum number o pairwise comparisons necessary for a derivation of weights ( and a ranking ) of all compared objects is ( n − 1 ) , assuming the corresponding graph is strongly connected . When less than ( n − 1 ) pairwise comparisons are available to a decision maker , the weights of compared objects cannot be derived by any aforementioned method . Further on , no study in the literature tackling this problem exists to authors’ best knowledge . Nevertheless , this situation may occur for example when new products are introduced in a market and their comparisons are still mostly unavailable ; when comparing new risks , threats or opportunities where even experts are unable to provide reliable judgments , which is a common situation when dealing with highly complex problems , or when it is difficult to obtain reliable data due to an excessive noise . However , the problem of acquiring a ( probable ) ranking from insufficient information is not as intractable as it seems . When an expert compares pairwise three objects , A , B and C , and she prefers A to B ( whilst providing no other information ) , then the probability of a ranking A ≻ B ≻ C ( where ’ ≻ ’ means preference ) is much more probable than the ranking B ≻ A ≻ C , or C ≻ B ≻ A . Therefore , the aim of the paper is to fill the aforemen - tioned gap and introduce a novel algorithm for the cases with insufficient information , that is cases when the number of known or available pairwise comparisons ranges from 1 to ( n − 2 ) . Further on , it is assumed that both known and unknown pairwise comparisons are ordinal and expressed via the following two binary relations : preference relation ( ≻ ) and indifference relation ( ∼ ) . Ordinal preferences can be considered more general than cardinal preferences , where a 979 - 8 - 3503 - 6929 - 8 / 24 / $ 31 . 00 ©2024 IEEE 2024 58 t h A nnu a l C on f e r e n ce on I n f o r m a ti on S c i e n ce s a nd S y s t e m s ( C I SS ) | 979 - 8 - 3503 - 6929 - 8 / 24 / $ 31 . 00 © 2024 I E EE | DO I : 10 . 1109 / C I SS 59072 . 2024 . 10480171 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE .

The proposed algorithm is based on a full enumeration of all possible cases for small PC matrices of the order n ≤ 5 , and on the Monte Carlo method ( sampling ) for PC matrices of the order n ≥ 6 . Algorithm’s input consists of the number of compared objects ( n ) and its output is a probability of each feasible ranking . The paper is organized as follows : Section 2 provides preliminaries on ordinal pairwise comparisons , in Section 3 the algorithm is presented and Section 4 demonstrates its use on a numerical example . Discussion and Conclusions close the article . II . P RELIMINARIES This Section provides a brief overview of important con - cepts and notations . In particular , a preference relation , total and partial order , ordinal pairwise comparisons and ordinal ( in ) consistency are formally defined thereinafter . DEFINITION 1 : Let C = { c 1 , . . . , c n } be a set of concepts ( objects ) . We write c i ≻ c j if the concept c i is preferred to the concept c j , and c i ∼ c j if the concept c i is equally preferred to the concept c j . Pairwise comparisons defined via Definition 1 are called ordinal pairwise comparisons . The preference relation ’ ≻ ’ and indifference relation ’ ∼ ’ are binary relations which together with the transitive property ( see Definitions 2 and 3 ) establish a partial ( total ) order over the set C : the elements of the set C can be ordered ( partially or completely ) from the most important to the least important element . A partial order of concepts can be considered a ranking with ties , while the total order as ranking without ties , or , shortly , ranking , in which all concepts as ordered from the most preferred to the least preferred . We assume only incomplete in - formation on ( ordinal ) pairwise comparisons is available , thus allowing to derive only a partial order of objects . However , in the next Section we demonstrate how to transform an initial partial order into the total order with a given probability . DEFINITION 2 : Let C = { c 1 , . . . , c n } be a set of concepts endowed with the relation ’ ≻ ’ ( ties are not allowed ) . Then the triad ( triplet ) ( c i , c j , c k ) is transitive if the following condition holds : c i ≻ c j ∧ c j ≻ c k ⇒ c i ≻ c k . Further on , the triad ( c i , c j , c k ) is intransitive if the following condition holds : c i ≻ c j ∧ c j ≻ c k ⇒ c k ≻ c i ( preferences form a cycle ) . DEFINITION 3 : Let C = { c 1 , . . . , c n } be a set of concepts endowed with relations ’ ≻ ’ and ’ ∼ ’ ( ties are allowed ) . Then the triad ( triplet ) ( c i , c j , c k ) is transitive if any of the following conditions holds ( up to the permutation of indices ) [ 18 ] : • T 1 : c i ≻ c j ∧ c j ≻ c k ∧ c i ≻ c k , • T 2 : c i ∼ c j ∧ c j ∼ c k ∧ c i ∼ c k , • T 3 : c i ∼ c j ∧ c j ≻ c k ∧ c i ≻ c k , • T 4 : c i ∼ c j ∧ c j ≺ c k ∧ c i ≺ c k . The triad ( c i , c j , c k ) is intransitive if any of the following conditions holds ( up to the permutation of indices ) [ 18 ] : • IT 1 : c i ≻ c j ∧ c j ≻ c k ∧ c k ≻ c i ( cycle ) , • IT 2 : c i ≻ c j ∧ c j ≻ c k ∧ c i ∼ c k ( near cycle ) , • IT 3 : c i ∼ c j ∧ c j ∼ c k ∧ c i ≻ c k . According to Definition 3 , every triad is either transitive , or intransitive , hence , the definition provides a suitable basis for the formulation of the ordinally ( in ) consistent matrix . DEFINITION 4 : Let M = [ m ij ] be an OPC matrix . Then the matrix M is strongly ordinally consistent if all triads contained in the matrix M are transitive . Otherwise , the matrix is strongly ordinally inconsistent . Definition 4 introduces a very strong version of consistency , which might not always be appropriate . Empirical studies show that humans are often inconsistent in their judgments , see e . g . [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , or [ 23 ] . The same deals with the intransitivity of preferences as shown in [ 22 ] . Thus , the following Definition 5 provides a relaxed version of strong ordinal consistency which allows a limited degree of inconsistency . DEFINITION 5 : Let M = [ m ij ] be an OPC matrix . Then the matrix M is weakly ordinally consistent if all triads contained in the matrix M are neither cyclic nor nearly cyclic . Otherwise , the matrix is weakly ordinally inconsistent . REMARK 1 : Definition 5 allows a matrix M to be weakly ordinally consistent even if it contains inconsistency IT 3 from Definition 3 . In such a case , the underlying rankings of the three objects c i , c j , c k are ( with the same probability ) : c i c j c k , c i c k c j , and c j c i c k . Ordinal pairwise comparisons can be represented in the form of a PC matrix or as a directed graph . As for the former , an ordinal pairwise comparisons matrix is defined as follows . DEFINITION 6 : The matrix M = [ m ij ] , m ij ∈ { ≻ , ≺ , ∼ } , where relations ’ ≻ and ’ ∼ ’ are defined in Definition 2 , is called a complete ordinal pairwise comparisons ( or , shortly , COPC ) matrix . DEFINITION 7 : The matrix M = [ m ij ] , m ij ∈ { ≻ , ≺ , ∼ , ? } , where relations ’ ≻ and ’ ∼ ’ are defined in Definition 2 , and ’ ? ’ denotes a missing element , is called an incomplete ordinal pairwise comparisons ( IOPC ) matrix . Similarly to a complete OPC matrix , an incomplete OPC matrix can be either strongly ( weakly ) consistent , or strongly ( weakly ) inconsistent . EXAMPLE 1 : Consider four concepts c 1 , c 2 , c 3 , c 4 and the following preference relations : c 1 ≻ c 2 , c 1 ≻ c 3 , c 1 ≻ c 4 , c 2 ≺ c 3 , c 2 ≻ c 4 , and c 3 ≺ c 4 . Then the corresponding ordinal PC matrix M 1 is given as follows : M 1 =   ∼ ≻ ≻ ≻ ≺ ∼ ≺ ≻ ≺ ≻ ∼ ≺ ≺ ≺ ≻ ∼   , where we assume that diagonal terms are ’ ∼ ’ since each concept is equal to itself . The preferences in the matrix M 1 can be represented by a directed graph , see Figure 1 , such that for each c i ≻ c j the corresponding edge aims from the vertex i to the vertex j . Notice that an intransitive triad , such Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply . as ( c 2 , c 3 , c 4 ) , forms a cycle , hence , the matrix M 1 is ordinally inconsistent . Fig . 1 . Graph representation of preferences from Example 1 . EXAMPLE 2 : Consider four concepts c 1 , c 2 , c 3 , c 4 and the following preference relations : c 1 ≻ c 2 , c 2 ≺ c 3 . The missing elements are denoted as ’ ? ’ . Then the corresponding IOPC matrix M is given as follows : M 2 =   ∼ ≻ ? ? ≺ ∼ ≺ ? ? ≻ ∼ ? ? ? ? ∼   , The preferences in the matrix M 2 can be represented by a directed graph , see Figure 2 , such that for each c i ≻ c j the corresponding edge aims from the vertex i to the vertex j . Notice that an intransitive triad , such as ( c 2 , c 3 , c 4 ) , forms a cycle , hence , the matrix M is ordinally inconsistent . Fig . 2 . Graph representation of preferences from Example 2 . In previous examples , the matrix M 1 is one of many possible completions of a matrix M 2 , albeit an inconsistent one . It is obvious that when a COPC matrix is ordinally inconsistent no total order ( ranking ) of corresponding concepts exists due to the violation of transitivity . In Example 1 , the COPC matrix M is ordinally inconsistent , which implies no total order of concepts can be established from underlying preferences ( recall the cycle of concepts c 2 , c 3 , and c 4 ) . The last example in this section provides insight into the main idea of our approach and workings of the HS - FE algorithm . EXAMPLE 3 : Consider three concepts A , B , C . The only OPC available is A ≻ C . The missing elements are denoted as ’ ? ’ . Then the corresponding IOPC matrix M 3 is given as fol - lows : M 3 =   ∼ ? ≻ ? ∼ ? ≺ ? ∼   , We would like to rank object A , B and D from the most preferred to the least preferred , but , apparently , information provided is insufficient ( in the case of 3 objects we need at least 2 comparisons ) . However , since we know that behind the ’ ? ’ there are only three possibilities : ’ ≻ ’ , ’ ∼ ’ , and ’ ≺ ’ , there are 9 possible fillings of the matrix M 3 : M ( 1 ) 3 =   ∼ ≻ ≻ ≺ ∼ ≻ ≺ ≺ ∼   M ( 2 ) 3 =   ∼ ≻ ≻ ≺ ∼ ∼ ≺ ∼ ∼   M ( 3 ) 3 =   ∼ ≻ ≻ ≺ ∼ ≺ ≺ ≻ ∼   M ( 4 ) 3 =   ∼ ∼ ≻ ∼ ∼ ≻ ≺ ≺ ∼   M ( 5 ) 3 =   ∼ ∼ ≻ ∼ ∼ ∼ ≺ ∼ ∼   M ( 6 ) 3 =   ∼ ∼ ≻ ∼ ∼ ≺ ≺ ≻ ∼   M ( 7 ) 3 =   ∼ ≺ ≻ ≻ ∼ ≻ ≺ ≺ ∼   M ( 8 ) 3 =   ∼ ≺ ≻ ≻ ∼ ∼ ≺ ∼ ∼   M ( 9 ) 3 =   ∼ ≺ ≻ ≻ ∼ ≺ ≺ ≻ ∼   . From these 9 possible complete OCP matrices , 4 are strongly inconsistent . The remaining 5 consistent matrices lead to the rankings shown in Table 1 . For example , in the case of the matrix M ( 2 ) 3 there are two feasible rankings , ABC and ACB , since B and C are tied for the second place . Next , each ranking receives its weight : the ranking ABC induced from the matrix M ( 1 ) 3 gets the weight equal to 1 ; rankings ABC and ACB derived from the matrix M ( 2 ) 3 get the weight equal to 0 . 5 each ( so the sum of weights is 1 again ) , and so on . Since the total weight is 5 , we can infer a probability of each ranking by dividing its sum of weights by 5 , see the last row of Table 1 . As can be seen , the most probable ranking is ABC with 40 % followed by rankings ACB and BAC , both with 30 % . The object C is never ranked first as a consequence of the only available pairwise comparison m 13 = ′ ≻ ′ , which places A before C . If the weak ordinal consistency was used instead of the strong ordinal consistency , then the matrix M ( 5 ) 3 would be ordinally consistent with underlying rankings ABC , ACB and BAC , see Table 2 . The most probable ranking would be ABC with 39 % . Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply .

T HE HS - FE A LGORITHM The proposed hybrid stochastic - full enumeration ( HS - FE ) algorithm is designed for the ordinal pairwise comparisons ( OPCs ) , where the number of OPCs ranges from 1 to ( n − 2 ) , where n denotes the number of compared concepts ( objects ) . The input of the HS - FE algorithm consists of the problem size n and up to ( n − 2 ) OPCs , while the output of the algorithm consists of probability of each feasible ranking ( total order ) of n compared entities . In general , the algorithm searches for all feasible rankings that can be derived from every consistent completion of the initial matrix M , and provides probability of each ranking based on its relative frequency . The HS - FE algorithm proceeds as follows : STEP 1 ( Input ) . The number of compared concepts n , the set of all ( n ! ) possible rankings ( permutations ) R j of n objects , an IOPC matrix M with up to ( n − 2 ) known elements m ij ∈ { ≺ , ≻ , ∼ } , and the number of missing elements k above the main diagonal . STEP 2 . Check whether the input IOPC matrix M is strongly consistent . If YES , then PROCEED . If NO , then END ( if there is a cycle , then there is a contradiction in preferences and objects cannot be ranked ) . STEP 3 . Estimate the value of 3 k , which is the number of possible fillings of the matrix M . If this number is less than 100 , 000 , go to STEP 4 , otherwise go to STEP 5 . STEP 4 . Generate the set S of all possible completions of the IOPC matrix M and go to STEP 6 . STEP 5 Generate the set S of 100 , 000 random possible completions of the IOPC matrix M . STEP 6 . Evaluate each matrix in the set S with respect to its ordinal ( weak or strong ) consistency and remove all matrices that are inconsistent . STEP 7 . Form a new set S 0 of complete and consistent OPC matrices denoted as T l , l ∈ { 1 , . . . , | S 0 | } . STEP 8 . For each matrix T l ∈ S 0 find underlying rankings ( rankings in accord with preferences contained in the matrix ) r il , i ∈ { 1 , . . . , L } , and assign the weight w il = 1 L to each of them . ( If some matrix T l induces two rankings , then each ranking receives its weight w 1 l = w 2 l = 1 / 2 . The sum of rankings’ weights corresponding to one matrix is always 1 . ) STEP 9 . Find all rankings r il ( with weights w il ) identical to the ranking R 1 and assign to it the weight φ 1 = (cid:80) r il w il . REPEAT for all rankings R j , j ∈ { 1 , . . . , n ! } . STEP 10 . Calculate the probability Π j of each ranking R j as follows : Π j = φ j | S 0 | . STEP 11 ( Output ) : Print 5 or 10 most probable rankings and END . REMARK 2 : For every IOPC matrix M of the order n with k missing elements , there are 3 k possibilities how to fill this matrix , and (cid:0) n 3 (cid:1) triads to be evaluated in terms of their consistency ( transitivity ) . These two tasks constitute the main computational burden associated with the algorithm’s procedure , while other tasks including ranking inference are O ( n 2 ) at most . Therefore , the computational complexity of the HS - FE algorithm is O ( 3 k n 5 ) . For larger values of n and k it is not computationally tractable to generate all feasible cases . In such a case , a full enumeration ( STEP 4 ) is replaced by a stochastic approach , namely random sampling from the set of all feasible completions of a given matrix M ( STEP 5 ) . The number of randomly generated cases could be 100 , 000 , or higher . Thus , the computational complexity of the HS - FE algorithm reduces to O ( n 5 ) . IV . I LLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE In this section a simple application of the HS - FE algorithm is provided . Consider the following incomplete ordinal pairwise com - parisons matrix M 4 ( see below ) of four objects : A , B , C and D . We will derive the most probable ranking with the infor - mation provided in the matrix M 4 assuming strong ordinal consistency .

In our case n = 4 and k = 4 . STEP 2 . The matrix M 3 does not contain a cycle , see Fig . 3 , hence we proceed to STEP 3 . STEP 3 . 3 k = 3 4 = 81 < 100 , 000 , hence we proceed to STEP 4 . STEP 4 . The set S of all possible completions of the matrix M 4 is formed by full enumeration ( contains 81 cases ) . STEP 6 . All matrices in the set S are evaluated with respect to their ( strong ) ordinal consistency . Out of 81 matrices , 12 are consistent and 69 are inconsistent . STEP 7 . A new set S 0 of only consistent matrices is formed . STEP 8 . To each matrix in set S 0 all underlying rankings ( consistent with peferences ) are found , see Table 3 , and each ranking is assigned its weight , see Table 4 . For example , the matrix no . 2 allows two rankings , BACD and BCAD , hence each receives the weight of 0 . 5 . The matrix no . 5 is consistent with four rankings ( BCAD , BCDA , CBAD and CBDA ) , hence each ranking attains the weight of 0 . 25 . STEP 9 . To each ranking R j its value of φ j ( a sum of weights of all rankings r il identical to R j ) is calculated , see Table 4 . For example , the weight φ of the ranking CBAD is : φ CBAD = 0 . 25 + 1 + 0 . 5 = 1 . 75 . STEP 11 . To each ranking R j its probability Π j is calcu - lated ( in % ) , see Table 4 . For example , the probability of the ranking CBAD is as follows : Π CBAD = 1 . 7512 = 0 . 1458 = 14 . 58 % . ( the weight over all rankings is | S 0 | = 12 - the number of consistent matrices ) . STEP 12 . The results are presented in Figure 3 . As can be seen , there are only 6 rankings with non - zero probability and each ranking is consistent with the input information ( m 12 = ′ ≺ ′ and m 34 = ′ ≻ ′ ) . If a decision maker is only interested in the best object , then objects B and C are tied for the first spot with the probability of 50 % . V . D ISCUSSION The presented approach , and the HS - FE algorithm itself , can be refined in several ways .

Most probable rankings from Illustrative example . Firstly , ordinal pairwise comparisons defined via Definition 1 can be considered simple ordinal pairwise comparisons , since it is the simplest case of the model with the relations T = { ∼ , ⊏ , ⊂ , < , ≺ } , see [ 12 ] – [ 14 ] . However , it was argued in [ 12 ] ( and to some extend in [ 16 ] , albeit in a different context ) that using only a pair { ≺ , ∼ } may give better ( more trustworthy ) results than using the whole set T . Secondly , an extension of total orders of objects towards weak / stratified orders ( which can be found e . g . in [ 7 ] , or [ 8 ] ) , as shown in Figure 4 , is also possible . In such a case , new orders such as { A , B } C , or A { B , C } would be added to the set of total orders , where { A , B } C denotes the weak order { A ≻ C , B ≻ C , A ∼ B } . However , while total orders may be perceived to be somewhat artificial , they remain certainly most preferred versions of rankings ( recall various TOP10 lists and ranking ) . The last but not least modification of the proposed approach is its natural extension towards cardinal pairwise comparisons , where each pairwise comparison is expressed on a given numerical scale . The most popular scales for cardinal pairwise comparisons include Saaty’s scale from 1 to 9 ( with recipro - cals ) [ 26 ] , or a continuous scale ] 0 , ∞ [ [ 17 ] .

The algorithm is based on a hybrid stochastic or full enumeration ( hence its title ) of feasible consistent completions of a corresponding ordinal pairwise comparisons matrix . Our approach may be very useful in situations where the relevant data are largely missing , or when they are unreliable . Our future theoretical research will focus on algorithm’s extension towards preference relations expessing various levels of preference ( weak , medium , strong , etc . ) , see e . g . [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , or [ 14 ] , and , on a more practical level , on a software implementation of the algorithm to facilitate its use . VII .
