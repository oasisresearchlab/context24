To better understand teachers’ fear of infection and risk perception we conducted a survey in Germany . Methods Participants were recruited through various associations and invited to take part in a cross - sectional COVID - 19 specific online survey . Anonymous demographic and self - reported data were collected from those who gave their informed consent . Descriptive statistical analysis was performed . To evaluate with fear associated factors of contracting SARS - CoV - 2 , an adjusted multivariable regression analysis was performed . Results 6 . 753 teachers gave their informed consent to answer the online survey . The median age of the teachers was 43 years with 77 % being female . Most teachers worked in high schools ( 29 % ) and elementary schools ( 26 % ) . Most participants ( 73 % ) feared to contract SARS - CoV - 2 at school while 77 % intended to be vaccinated against COVID - 19 . 98 % considered students to pose the greatest risk . Multivariable regression analysis revealed that female and younger teachers were significantly more anxious to get infected with SARS - CoV - 2 and that the odds teachers were more anxious was 9 times higher for those who favored re - opening of schools the least ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Conclusions To the authors’ knowledge , this is the first study to describe teachers fear and risk perception of COVID - 19 and their attitude towards vaccinations in a nationwide survey . The anxiety correlates to the COVID - 19 protection measures demanded . Teachers’ fear is the driving factor and not a rational logic . .

This has resulted in many opinions and views that often differ from the scientific facts . In fact , more than 3 million people in Germany have been tested positively for SARS - CoV - 2 so far . Nearly 80 , 000 deaths are linked to Corona Virus Disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) ( as of April 14 , 2021 , ( 1 ) ) . Prior to the launch of the vaccination campaign in November 2020 , the German population ' s intention to get vaccinated was 37 % ( 2 ) . In the events of the second and third waves and with increasingly stricter COVID - 19 measures in place , the vaccination intention rose to 59 % in February and 75 % in May 2021 . However , these are overall numbers that hardly mirror the vaccination intention of different occupational groups which may have an above average risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infections . Intensive care healthcare workers’ vaccination intention had risen from 65 % to more than 75 % between December 2020 and February 2021 ( 3 ) . A survey conducted in Saxony , Germany at about the same time showed that a staggering 90 % of teachers from public schools and around 80 % in private school settings intended to receive COVID - 19 vaccinations ( 4 ) . A reason for this and whether this applies nationwide is unknown . Healthcare workers are clearly at particularly high risk of contracting SARS - CoV - 2 through physical contact to infected people . Teachers are also at high risk . However , as classroom teaching has been largely reduced and COVID - 19 precautions have been implemented in schools , most teachers are to a certain extent protected . The actual risk of teachers contracting SARS - CoV - 2 despite COVID - 19 precautions remains controversial . Children and adolescents probably spread the infection at similar rates ( 5 ) . While at the beginning of the pandemic studies observed no evidence of secondary transmission of COVID - 19 from children attending school ( 6 ) , it is now clear that infections have been imported into schools from the community where it can spread ( 7 ) . But further transmission within schools has been rare when rigorous measures such as wearing face masks and frequent ventilation of rooms have been implemented ( 8 - 10 ) suggesting that schools do not substantially contribute to increased circulation of SARS - CoV - 2 among local communities . However , the actual risk and the risk perception of teachers may differ significantly . With the multiwave pandemic dynamics in winter and spring 2020 / 21 hitting most countries hard , with health care systems reaching theirs limits and with schools remaining to be closed , we wanted to better understand teachers’ fear of infection and risk perception . Therefore , we invited teachers in Germany to participate in the newly developed ImpfREAD survey , in which we asked teachers’ fears and concerns contracting SARS - CoV - 2 , their intention to be vaccinated against COVID - 19 , and their opinions on new virus variants and COVID - 19 fighting strategies discussed by policy makers . .

The survey was conducted once and online . Methods Study design We conducted a cross - sectional real - world anonymous survey to determine teachers’ fear contracting SARS - CoV - 2 and their risk perception , their intention to receive COVID - 19 vaccinations , and their opinion on COVID - 19 precautions . The survey was conducted nationwide in Germany . Data collection took place between March 2 and April 30 , 2021 . Participants and enrolment Participants were recruited through the Education and Training Association ( VBE , Verband Bildung und Erziehung ) , German Teachers ' Association ( DL , Deutscher Lehrerverband ) , Union for Education and Training ( GEW , Gewerkschaft für Erziehung und Bildung ) , Association of German Private School Associations ( VDP , Verband Deutscher Privatschulverbände e . V . ) , Association of Waldorf Schools ( Bund der Freien Waldorfschulen ) and the Montessori Association ( Montessori Dachverband ) . The link to the survey was distributed to association members via email distribution lists . The educational network News4Teacher featured the survey on its website . School boards which were contacted directly also distributed the link via distribution lists . The Twitter account of the Institute for Social Medicine , Epidemiology and Health Economics ( @ CSozialmedizin ) posted the survey in a newsfeed . A snowballing system was encouraged , asking participants to share the survey with other teachers . The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki . Since the data in our study was collected anonymously ( no code lists available , no conclusion could be drawn from the collected data to personal data ) ethical approval was waived . The data collection took place in accordance with the European Data Protection Regulation . Prior to participating in the survey , participants were given a description and objectives of the study . Written informed consent has been obtained from all the participants prior study enrolment . The study was approved by the institutional data protection board and quality management based on the given data protection concept . Survey and Outcomes The survey was newly developed in a multi - disciplinary research collaboration between life scientists , psychologists , and physicians . The primary outcome was to clarify the impact of the COVID - 19 outbreak on teacher’s individual’s health - related worries and their intention to receive COVID - 19 vaccinations . The survey consisted of 9 parts capturing a ) socio - demographic characteristics , such as age , gender and school type , as well as teachers ' fear of contracting SARS - CoV - 2 , b ) teachers ' intentions to get .

The ImpfREAD survey consisted of a total of 92 items . Depending on the item participants could either indicate how likely they agree to each item on a five - point Likert scale ranging from ‘I agree absolutely’ to ‘I don’t agree at all’ , answer “yes” or “no” or choose from given answers . Data collection Data collection was performed by means of a structured , anonymous , self - administered questionnaire ( Appendix 1 ) using the Research Electronic Data Capture ( REDCap ) data management platform version 10 . 6 . 14 hosted at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin . REDCap is a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and databases ( 11 ) . Patients with missing data were not included . Statistical analyses Continuous variables were described as median with interquartile range ( IQR ) ; categorical variables were summarized as percentages . Univariate data was analyzed using MS Excel 2000 and GraphPad Prism version 9 . 0 . 0 . To address potential sources of bias , an adjusted multivariable regression analysis with dichotomic outcome of anxiousness of getting COVID - 19 ( yes / no ) was performed using the software R ( Version 3 . 6 . 1 , R Development Core Team , Vienna , Austria ) . p - values < 0 . 05 were considered to be significant . Results Participants The online survey was accessed by 6 . 995 individuals . 242 individuals either did not give informed consent or provided any information . 6 . 753 teachers providing their informed consent were included in the study and records were analyzed . Most of the participants ( 42 % ) were recruited through the educational magazine News4Teacher , via VBE and GEW ( 33 % ) , school boards ( 17 % ) , and other sources ( 8 % ) ( Supplementary table S1 ) . Demographic data The study was conducted with 6 . 753 teachers in Germany . The geographical distribution of the participating teachers was rather homogeneous with most participants coming from northern Germany ( Supplementary table S2 ) . Table 1 lists the socio - demographic characteristics of the participants . The median age of the teachers was 43 years ( IQR : 36 - 51 years ) and 77 % were female . .

Most of the participating teachers ( 40 % ) taught grades 7 – 13 students with German language ( 49 % ) and mathematics ( 42 % ) as the main subjects . Many of the teachers ( 64 % ) had children , with having two children ( 48 % ) or three or more children ( 22 % ) . 13 % were single parents . Almost 5 % of the teachers reported to have had COVID - 19 and 16 % had been vaccinated against COVID - 19 . 29 % reported to have one or more pre - existing conditions , e . g . , 18 % reported to have asthma or any other respiratory disease or hypertension and 2 % being obese . Teachers’ fears of contracting SARS - CoV - 2 at school A striking majority of the participating teachers ( 73 % ) feared contracting SARS - CoV - 2 at work ( Figure 1 , Supplementary table S3 ) . Only 11 % of participants were not at all afraid of getting infected at work . Students ( 98 % ) , younger ( 44 % ) and older colleagues ( 30 % ) were named as major thread of infection ( Figure 1 , Supplementary table S4 ) . Interestingly , 77 % reported that teachers also pose a risk to students ( Supplementary table S4 ) . A majority of the teachers ( 71 % ) feared that students might carry and transmit SARS - CoV - 2 even though being asymptomatic ( Figure 1 , Supplementary table S3 ) . Additionally , many teachers agreed that schools and students substantially contribute to spread SARS - CoV - 2 in communities and schools , respectively ( 66 % and 65 % , respectively , Figure 1 , Supplementary table S3 ) . Multivariable regression analysis adjusting for age , gender , intention to get vaccinated , school types , the opinion whether to open schools as highest priority , the risk perception of getting COVID - 19 , and the class subjects taught , revealed that female teachers ( OR 1 . 92 , p < 0 . 001 ) were significantly more anxious of getting COVID - 19 compared to their male colleagues ( Figure 2 , Supplementary table S5 ) . In contrast , teachers who don’t want or are unsure about getting vaccinated feared an infection significantly less ( OR 0 . 02 , p < 0 . 001 , OR 0 . 17 , p < 0 . 001 , respectively ) compared to teachers intending to get vaccinated . Interestingly , also teachers from Waldorf schools and schools for children with special needs showed significantly less fear ( OR 0 . 38 , p < 0 . 001 ; OR 0 . 63 , p = 0 . 0264 , respectively ) . Also , teachers who perceived their risk of getting COVID - 19 as moderate , low , or not existing had significantly less fear ( OR 0 . 12 , p = 0 . 000 ; OR 0 . 03 , p < 0 . 001 ; OR 0 . 01 , p < 0 . 001 , respectively ) compared to teachers who perceived their risk as high ( Figure 2 , Supplementary table S5 ) . Strikingly , teachers who oppose the re - opening of schools are 9 times more anxious than teachers who consider school re - openings as very important ( OR 8 . 94 , p < 0 . 001 ) . At last , teachers of foreign languages were significantly less anxious than teachers not teaching foreign languages . With a tendency towards significance , music teachers were more anxious compared to non - music teachers ( OR 1 . 34 , p = 0 . 0501 ) . Overall , the fear of COVID - 19 decreases with age with the odds decreasing by .

Furthermore , we asked about possible conflicts with parents and teachers’ opinion on COVID - 19 precautions . A majority ( 47 % ) felt that parents were too careless about SARS - CoV - 2 and thought primarily of themselves and childcare ( 45 % , Supplementary table S6 ) . Most teachers ( 58 % ) reported to feel being under pressure to implement COVID - 19 precaution state guidelines . Similarly , 49 % felt they do not meet the expectations of parents and the states regarding the implementation of COVID - 19 precautions while educating child - friendly and to a high standard ( Supplementary table S6 ) . Many teachers ( 45 % ) had given in at some point to parent’s insistence on additional COVID - 19 precautions ( Supplementary table S6 ) . Teachers’ fear suffering severe COVID - 19 and the new SARS - CoV - 2 variants 35 % of the participating teachers considered their risk of suffering severe COVID - 19 as being increased , high or very high ( Table 2 ) . Many teachers volunteered to be tested for SARS - CoV - 2 infections depending on the risk situation or at least once a week ( 42 % and 33 % respectively , Supplementary table S7 ) . By the end of 2020 , new variants of SARS - CoV - 2 had spread from abroad to many European countries . These new variants increased concerns getting COVID - 19 in 72 % of the participating teachers ( Table 2 ) . A majority saw the third COVID - 19 wave in Germany coming and was concerned that a strained health care system limits their ability to access a hospital and , if necessary , an intensive care unit ( 76 % and 65 % , respectively ) . Despite strict lockdown measures in place , 37 % of the teachers rated the general non - pharmacological precautions as still too low ( Table 2 ) . A striking majority ( 78 % ) believed that COVID - 19 can also become a seasonal illness due to mutations in SARS - CoV - 2 ( Supplementary table S8 ) . Teachers ' opinion on vaccinations , vaccination strategy and priority setting By the time of the survey period , only a minor fraction of the participating teachers ( 16 % ) had received a COVID - 19 vaccination ( Table 1 ) . But most teachers ( 77 % ) intended to get vaccinated ( Figure 1 ) . Only 6 % were unsure about the COVID - 19 vaccination . Many teachers ( 72 % ) showed a strong preference for the BioNTech vaccine ( Supplementary table S9 ) . 43 % and 22 % of the participating teachers would also choose the Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines , respectively . Surprisingly , 23 % of the teachers did not have any preference towards a specific vaccine ( Supplementary table S9 ) . The main reasons given by most of the participants to get vaccinated were self - protection from getting COVID - 19 ( 97 % ) and protection of family , friends , children , and others ( 92 % , 75 % and 78 % , respectively ) ( Supplementary table S10 ) . However , only 26 % of the teachers choose returning to school quickly as a reason of getting .

On the other hand , teachers refrain from COVID - 19 vaccinations for different reasons , such as unknown long - term effects ( 87 % ) , vaccines not been adequately tested ( 78 % ) , and concerns about adverse events ( 76 % ) . Many participants felt a distrust of the manufacturers and vaccines ( 49 % and 52 % , respectively ) ( Supplementary table S10 ) . Surprisingly , many teachers ( 67 % ) supported the notion that all colleagues should be vaccinated against COVID - 19 before returning to work ( Supplementary table S3 ) . In Germany , there are no compulsory vaccinations . However , in this study , teachers voted rather equally for and against a compulsory vaccination against COVID - 19 discussed by policy makers ( 43 % and 40 % , respectively ) ( Supplementary table S11 ) . Surprisingly , a majority ( 49 % ) supported the idea of compulsory vaccinations for other infectious diseases ( Supplementary table S11 ) . A large majority ( 70 % ) has regularly checked that they had received all recommended vaccinations . In addition , almost 62 % considered the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Vaccination ( STIKO ) to be appropriate ( Supplementary table S12 ) . Until June 2021 , COVID - 19 vaccine allocation was subject to subdivision into priority groups by law in Germany . 71 % of the participating teachers agreed with this division ( Supplementary table S13 ) . Similarly , 73 % agreed that teachers receive the vaccination earlier when priority groups were changed in late February 2021 . Furthermore , a majority ( 53 % ) rated re - opening schools as being a top priority ( Supplementary table S13 ) . However , regarding new virus variants and a third COVID - 19 wave , more teachers ( 76 % ) wanted to proceed cautiously in re - opening schools ( Table 2 ) . Discussion With the second COVID - 19 wave hitting Germany at the end of 2020 , schools became a focus of attention . Vaccinations had just begun but although teachers’ vaccination intention was above average and their role in society is highly acknowledged , they were not prioritized for vaccinations . A public debate arose around teachers’ vaccinations and the role of schools and children in spreading SARS - CoV - 2 . To investigate factors associated with teachers’ intention to be vaccinated against COVID - 19 we conducted a cross - sectional survey of 6 . 753 teachers in Germany . Using the newly developed ImpfREAD survey , we aimed to investigate both fears and risk perceptions regarding a SARS - CoV - 2 infection at school , as well as teachers ' attitudes towards vaccinations . So far , only a few studies investigated teachers’ fear of contracting SARS - CoV - 2 . A cross - sectional study in summer 2020 in Berlin , Germany revealed that about half of the school staff showed medium to very strong fear of infection , and 59 % reported moderate to very high perceived risk of infection ( 12 ) . However , this study comprised only 112 teachers at 24 schools in Berlin , mirroring only a limited number of teacher’s opinion which in part can largely depend on their respective schools . Another study , conducted in February 2020 with nearly 9 . 000 teachers in three cities in China found a .

Another study of almost 1 . 700 teachers conducted in September 2020 in Spain , reported that nearly half of the teachers surveyed had anxiety ( 14 ) . However , both latter studies used anxiety scales which do not specifically focus on the situation during a pandemic . In our study we found 73 % teachers being afraid of getting infected with SARS - CoV - 2 at school . Female teachers were significantly more anxious than their male colleagues which is consistent with the fact , that women are twice as likely to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder than men ( 15 ) . It is striking that teachers ' anxiety correlates with their attitude towards school re - openings , i . e . , the less teachers rated school re - openings as a priority , the greater their anxiety was . Interestingly , teachers at Waldorf schools were significantly less anxious than teachers at primary schools . Rudolf Steiner ' s concept of health strongly incorporates a salutogenetic regulatory principle of the human organism , which could be the cause of the Waldorf teachers ' reduced anxiety . In our study , 4 . 6 % of the teachers had contracted COVID - 19 , which is similar to the rate of the overall population ( 1 ) . Recent studies showed that teachers do not bear an increased risk of contracting SARS - CoV - 2 ( 16 ) , however , the perceived risk may differ significantly . Our survey showed that nearly 35 % of the teachers assess their risk of suffering severe COVID - 19 as at least increased , and that a large majority fear not to receive adequate medical care due to the overloaded health system . Many patients who were hospitalized with severe COVID - 19 have an underlying disease , are older or very obese ( 17 , 18 ) . In our study , fear was highest among the youngest and decreased with age , which strikingly contradicts the actual risk for severe COVID - 19 . The median age of the teachers was 43 years with under 9 % reporting of having asthma or any other respiratory disease suggesting that teachers of our study do not have a higher risk of severe COVID - 19 than the overall population . It can be speculated that teachers only perceive their risk as being high . In fact , our data show that teachers who assess their risk as high or moderate are significantly more anxious compared to their colleagues who perceive their risk as low , respectively . Further studies are needed to evaluate the reasons why anxiety promotes teacher’s risk perception . Although schools were discussed to be COVID - 19 infection hotspots , current evidence suggests against a major role for schools in driving the pandemic . Children and adolescents are typically less susceptible to infection ( 19 - 22 ) than older individuals . Additionally , previous data showed that children are rarely the index cases of clusters ( 8 , 9 , 19 ) . In Germany , only 48 COVID - 19 outbreaks were registered at schools with ≥2 cases between January and August 2020 ( 1 ) , accounting for 0 . 5 % of all reported outbreaks during this period . Further studies concluded that re - opening of schools in Germany under strict hygiene measures have not increased the number of newly confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infections ( 23 - 25 ) . After SARS - CoV - 2 infections , children usually show milder symptoms ( 26 , 27 ) and up to 50 % of them may remain asymptomatic ( 28 ) . The actual number of infected children attending .

The concern of a large majority of our interviewed teachers that children attend school asymptomatically despite being infected is therefore justified . On the other hand , child - to - child transmission seems to be lower than intrafamily transmission and transmission from and between adults ( 29 , 30 ) . Also , larger school outbreaks are rather associated with higher SARS - CoV - 2 positivity rates in school staff and secondary transmissions from teachers ( 31 , 32 ) . This is probably why many participating teachers in our study supported the notion that all colleagues should be vaccinated before returning to the classroom . During the 2020 / 21 SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic , many countries closed schools . Restrictions on large and prolonged social gatherings , such as educational closures , have been identified as one of the most effective non - pharmaceutical interventions ( 33 ) . However , school closures may substantially disrupt the lives of children and their families and may have consequences for children ' s mental health ( 34 ) . In our study , most teachers believe that schools are a major contributor spreading SARS - CoV - 2 and are warning to proceed with caution when re - opening schools even though previous studies convincingly showed that schools play a subordinate role spreading SARS - CoV - 2 ( 24 , 25 ) . So , we can speculate that teachers at German schools are performing a continuous balancing act between caring about their health and well - being and their pedagogical mission . And indeed , according to latest findings of a qualitative study , teachers emphasize prioritizing and promoting health and well - being of pupils and teachers in the school learning environment ( 35 ) . Our study had limitations . Most of the participating teachers were recruited via a news magazine and teachers’ associations . Teachers who were neither members of the associations nor visit the webpage of News4teachers could therefore not be included in the study . Furthermore , teachers from vocational schools were not included . Their fear and risk perception may differ as they teach adolescents and young adults . At last , our survey was conducted from March - April 2021 . During this dynamic time , Germany faced the second and third COVID - 19 waves , vaccination plans changed , schools re - opened and closed depending on the state , and the government relaxed and tightened lockdown measures depending on the numbers of new cases having possibly an impact on teachers’ fear and risk perception . The proportion of female teachers in our study reflects the national gender proportion of teachers . The external validity is therefore given . To the authors’ knowledge , this is the first study to describe teachers fear and risk perception of COVID - 19 and their attitude towards vaccinations in a nationwide survey . In conclusion , this study shows a strong fear and risk perception among teachers in Germany which results in an above average vaccination intention . Further studies are needed to evaluate whether new virus variants may change infection events also in adolescents and students . .
