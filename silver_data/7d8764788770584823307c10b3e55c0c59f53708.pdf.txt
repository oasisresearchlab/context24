Watson 5 Postdoctoral Researcher 6 Department of Earth Sciences 7 University of Oregon 8 Eugene , OR , USA 9 lwatson2 @ uoregon . edu 10 11 Abstract : 12 Aim : The New Zealand government is transitioning from the Alert Level framework , which relies on 13 government action and population level controls , to the COVID - 19 Protection Framework , which relies 14 on vaccination rates and allows for greater freedoms ( for the vaccinated ) . As restrictions are eased , there 15 is significant interest in understanding the relative risk of spreading COVID - 19 posed by unvaccinated 16 and vaccinated individuals . 17 18 Methods : A stochastic branching process model is used to simulate the spread of COVID - 19 for 19 outbreaks seeded by unvaccinated or vaccinated individuals . The likelihood of infecting or getting 20 infected with COVID - 19 is calculated based on vaccination status . 21 22 Results : A vaccinated traveler infected with COVID - 19 is 9x less likely to seed an outbreak than an 23 unvaccinated traveler infected with COVID - 19 . For a vaccination rate of 50 % , unvaccinated individuals 24 are responsible for 87 % of all infections whereas 3 % of infections are from vaccinated to vaccinated . 25 When normalized by population , a vaccinated individual is 6 . 8x more likely to be infected by an 26 unvaccinated individual than by a vaccinated individual . For a total population vaccination rate of 78 . 7 % , 27 which is equivalent to the 90 % vaccination target for the eligible population ( over 12 years old ) , this 28 means that vaccinated individuals are 1 . 9x more likely to be infected by an unvaccinated individual than 29 by a vaccinated , even though there are 3 . 7x more vaccinated individuals in the population . 30 31 Conclusions : This work demonstrates that most new infections are caused by unvaccinated individuals . 32 These simulations illustrate the importance of vaccination in stopping individuals from becoming infected 33 with COVID - 19 and in preventing onward transmission . 34 .

Since the detection of the 38 outbreak on 17 August 2021 , double - dose vaccination rates have increased from approximately 19 % of 39 the total population to 70 % on 21 November 2021 . 1 , 2 As a result , the COVID - 19 pandemic is turning into 40 a pandemic of the unvaccinated ; only 12 % of cases and 5 % of hospitalizations in the current outbreak 41 have been fully vaccinated ( defined as more than two weeks since the second dose of the two - dose Pfizer - 42 BioNTech vaccine ) . 1 , 2 As the country begins to transition to the COVID - 19 Protection Framework , which 43 predominantly uses vaccination certificates , instead of the Alert Level system , which uses population 44 level controls , and as the Auckland border is relaxed to allow fully vaccinated or negative - tested 45 individuals to travel , it is important to understand the relative likelihood of vaccinated versus 46 unvaccinated individuals spreading COVID - 19 . 47 48 Here , I use the stochastic model developed in [ 3 ] to estimate the likely number of infections caused by an 49 outbreak seeded by an unvaccinated versus vaccinated individual . This information can help inform 50 reopening decisions and restrictions on travel ( e . g . , requiring vaccination or a negative test prior to 51 travel ) . I also calculate the likelihood of infecting others or getting infected with COVID - 19 based on 52 vaccination status . Mathematical modeling is a useful tool for understanding these probabilities because , 53 as the number of COVID - 19 cases in the community has increased , contact tracers have prioritized 54 preventing onwards transmission compared to finding the source of infections . 4 As a result , the likelihood 55 of infecting others or getting infected as a function of vaccination status is not available for real - world 56 cases but can be determined from model simulations . 57 58 59 Methods 60 61 A stochastic branching process model is used to simulate the initial spread of a COVID - 19 outbreak , 62 similar to previous work by [ 5 - 7 ] . The model tracks the number of infections and the vaccination status of 63 the infecting and infected individuals . The stochastic model used here is the same as presented in [ 3 ] with 64 the pertinent details summarized below . 65 66 Each infected individual infects a random number of other individuals , N , drawn from a Poisson 67 distribution . 5 For symptomatic individuals , the Poisson distribution is defined by l = RC where R is the 68 .

It is 85 unclear how testing rates will change in a highly vaccinated public or how effective self - isolation will 86 prove to be . Therefore , I focus purely on the impact of vaccination rates , particularly on the early stages 87 of an outbreak when cases may be circulating undetected . 88 89 Age is not accounted for in this model , either in the vaccination rollout where older individuals are more 90 likely to be vaccinated , or in the susceptibility where older individuals are more likely to experience 91 severe disease or death . Age also plays a role in transmission with young children are less likely to 92 transmit the virus 14 , 15 as well as through different ages groups having different levels of mobility and 93 hence different numbers of contacts . See [ 7 , 13 ] for a New Zealand focused model that accounts for age . 94 Other limitations include not accounting for ethnicity , either in vaccination rates or differential risk 95 factors for different ethnic groups , 16 or socio - economic status ; COVID - 19 spreads rapidly through 96 overcrowded households as well as posing a greater risk to those who do not have the economic resources 97 to safely isolate or the ability to work - from - home . 16 Vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals are 98 modelled as equally likely to interact ( based on the vaccination rate ) . 99 100 101 102 .

The simulations are run 106 100 , 000 times for each scenario to get a representative sampling of the possible outcomes from the 107 stochastic model . 108 109 Vaccination Status of Seed Infection 110 111 The regional boundary around Auckland will be relaxed on 15 December 2021 and people will be able to 112 travel in and out of Auckland if they are fully vaccinated or have proof of a negative test within 72 hours 113 of traveling . 17 Despite these protective measures , it is likely that the movement of people out of Auckland 114 will result in COVID - 19 being seeded in other locations around the country ( as has already been observed 115 with outbreaks in Waikato and Northland and other cases scattered around the country ) . Here , I consider 116 the possible numbers of infections in an outbreak based on the vaccination status of the seed infection 117 ( Figure 1 ) . The simulations are performed for a vaccination rate of 78 . 7 % of the total population ; this is 118 approximately 90 % of the eligible population ( over 12 years old ) , which is the government’s vaccination 119 target for all District Health Boards . Note that this work assumes that an infected individual can travel and 120 seed a new outbreak . I do not model the impact of vaccination or testing requirements on preventing 121 infected people from travelling and catching cases before they travel and seed new outbreaks . 122 123 Figure 1a shows the probability of a given number of infections 31 days into an outbreak seeded by a 124 vaccinated individual or unvaccinated individual , with the cumulative probabilities in Figure 1b . For both 125 vaccinated and unvaccinated seed infections , there is a small possibility of large outbreaks developing 126 within the first 31 days of an infection being seeded ( 5 % chance of > 506 cases and > 657 cases for the 127 vaccinated and unvaccinated seed , respectively ) . However , for a vaccinated seed infection it is much 128 more likely that COVID - 19 does not spread beyond the initial case ; for a vaccinated seed infection there 129 is a 54 % chance that COVID - 19 does not spread to anyone else while for an unvaccinated seed infection 130 there is only a 6 % chance . This is because the vaccine is assumed to be 50 % effective at preventing 131 onward transmission . 7 , 13 For an unvaccinated seed infection , there is a 54 % chance that the outbreak has 132 up to 151 infections after 31 days . 133 134 Figure 1 shows the importance of vaccination in stopping outbreaks from being seeded . A vaccinated 135 traveler is 9x less likely to seed an outbreak in a community than an unvaccinated traveler ( note that this 136 .

This illustrates the importance that 138 travelers are vaccinated ( or tested prior to travelling , or both ) , especially if travelling from regions with 139 significant COVID - 19 community transmission ( e . g . , Auckland ) to regions with low vaccination rates 140 ( e . g . , Northland ) . Continued community testing ( not modeled here ) is required to rapidly identify any 141 outbreaks that are seeded before they grow . 142 143 144 145 Figure 1 : ( a ) Histograms showing probability of number of infections 31 days into an outbreak seeded by 146 ( blue ) one vaccinated individual or by ( red ) one unvaccinated individual .

This enables me to calculate the probability of infection based on the 156 vaccination status of the infecting individual and the infected individual . The results are calculated from 157 the mean of the 100 , 000 realizations . 158 159 160 Figure 2 : Likelihood that a new infection is caused by a ( U ) unvaccinated or ( V ) vaccinated individual 161 and that the new infection is in an unvaccinated or vaccinated individual . ( a ) shows a total vaccination 162 rate of 50 % , where there are an equal number of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in the 163 population , while ( b ) shows a total vaccination rate of 78 . 7 % , which is approximately the 90 % eligible 164 population target . ( a ) also shows the expected result when normalizing by population . 165 .

By contrast , only 13 % of infections are caused by vaccinated 169 individuals , and only 3 % of these are from vaccinated to vaccinated . This illustrates the importance of 170 vaccination in preventing individuals from ( a ) getting infected and ( b ) passing COVID - 19 on to others . 171 Figure 2a also illustrates that while the vaccine provides significant protection from getting infected , 172 vaccinated individuals can still get infected , predominantly from unvaccinated individuals . Vaccinated 173 individuals are 6 . 8x more likely to be infected by an unvaccinated individual than by a vaccinated 174 individual . Although Figure 2a is calculated for a vaccination rate of 50 % , it also gives the values that 175 would be observed at different vaccination rates after normalizing for population . This illustrates that the 176 majority of infections are caused by unvaccinated individuals . 177 178 Figure 2b shows the results for a total vaccination rate of 78 . 7 % . Unvaccinated individuals are 179 responsible for 65 % of infections despite only making up 21 . 3 % of the population . By contrast , 180 vaccinated individuals are only responsible for 35 % of infections while making up 78 . 7 % of the 181 population . Even at these high levels of vaccination where there are 3 . 7x as many vaccinated individuals 182 are unvaccinated individuals , a new infection is almost twice as likely to be caused by an unvaccinated 183 individual . A vaccinated individual has a 65 % chance of being infected by an unvaccinated individual 184 compared to a 35 % chance of being infected by a vaccinated individual ( 1 . 9x more likely to be infected 185 by unvaccinated individual even though there are far fewer unvaccinated individuals in the population ) . 186 Figure 2b illustrates that , even at high levels of vaccination , unvaccinated individuals are the main cause 187 for continued spread of COVID - 19 with only 18 % of infections from vaccinated to vaccinated . This 188 suggests that restricting unvaccinated individuals from high - risk locations ( i . e . , potential super - spreader 189 events ) will help to minimize the spread of COVID - 19 . 190 191 Conclusions 192 As vaccination rates increase and the government transitions to the COVID - 19 Protection Framework that 193 replaces population level controls with vaccination certificates , there is a need to better understand the 194 risk posed by unvaccinated versus vaccinated individuals . Here , I use a stochastic model to simulate the 195 potential numbers of infections in an outbreak seeded by a vaccinated individual versus by an 196 unvaccinated individual . Unvaccinated individuals are much more likely to seed an outbreak with 54 % 197 chance of causing an outbreak with over 107 cases after 31 days . By contrast , for a vaccinated seed 198 infection , there is a 54 % chance that the outbreak does not spread beyond the initial seed . Vaccinated 199 .

This model does not account 200 for testing requirements on travel and future work should combine this work with a testing model . 201 202 I also calculate the likelihood of getting infected and of infecting others based on vaccination status . 203 Unvaccinated individuals are much more likely to spread the virus and are responsible for 87 % of all 204 infections for a vaccination rate of 50 % and 65 % of all infections for a vaccination rate of 78 . 7 % . 205 Transmission between vaccinated individuals is rare and responsible for only 3 % of all infections for a 206 vaccination rate of 50 % and 18 % for a vaccination rate of 78 . 7 % ( the high likelihood at higher 207 vaccination rates reflects the increased amount of vaccination individuals in the population ) . This 208 illustrates that COVID - 19 is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated and is predominantly spread by 209 the unvaccinated . Vaccination is essential for individual protection as well as for preventing continued 210 spread of COVID - 19 . 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 .
