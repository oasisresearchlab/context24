SMI # 9 induces cytotoxicity in cancerous cells but spares normal breast cells ; however , its therapeutic efficacy is limited by poor solubility . Here we chemically modified SMI # 9 to enable its conjugation and hydrolysis from gold nanoparticle ( GNP ) . SMI # 9 - GNP and parent SMI # 9 activities were compared in mesenchymal and basal triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) subtype cells . Whereas SMI # 9 is cytotoxic to all TNBC cells , SMI # 9 - GNP is endocytosed and cytotoxic only in mesenchymal TNBC cells . SMI # 9 - GNP endocytosis in basal TNBCs is compromised by aggregation . However , when combined with cisplatin , SMI # 9 - GNP is imported and synergistically increases cisplatin sensitivity . Like SMI # 9 , SMI # 9 - GNP spares normal breast cells . The released SMI # 9 is active and induces cell death via mitochondrial dysfunction and PARP - 1 stabilization / hyperactivation . This work signifies the development of a nanotechnology - based Rad6 - targeting therapy for TNBCs . 3 Introduction The human homologues of yeast Rad6 , HHR6A and HHR6B ( referred as Rad6A and Rad6B ) play a fundamental role in DNA damage tolerance pathway ( 1 - 4 ) , and the ubiquitin conjugating ( UBC ) activity of Rad6 is essential for this function ( 5 , 6 ) . The Rad6B homologue is weakly expressed in normal breast cells but overexpressed in metastatic and chemoresistant breast carcinomas ( 7 - 9 ) . Constitutive overexpression of Rad6B in nontransformed human breast epithelial cells induces tumorigenesis and resistance to cisplatin and doxorubicin ( 7 , 10 , 11 ) . Conversely , Rad6B silencing renders cells chemosensitive ( 11 ) , implicating the relevance of Rad6 in transformation and drug resistance , and the potential therapeutic benefit of inhibiting Rad6 . We have recently reported the development of a novel Rad6 - selective small molecule inhibitor SMI # 9 that inhibits Rad6 UBC activity ( 12 ) . SMI # 9 treatment suppresses proliferation and migration , and induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells but spares normal breast cells ( 12 ) . However , SMI # 9 has poor aqueous solubility that limits its therapeutic efficacy . Here we developed a drug delivery system that would improve its solubility and uptake . Gold nanoparticles ( GNPs ) are ideal drug delivery scaffolds because they are nontoxic and nonimmunogenic ( 13 , 14 ) , and have good biocompatibility and stability ( 15 ) . Surface modification allows GNPs to be readily functionalized with multiple agents including chemotherapy , oligonucleotides and proteins making them good delivery vehicles ( 16 ) . Several GNP - based drugs have been developed by CytImmune with their lead drug Aurimune ( TNF  bearing PEGylated gold nanoparticles ) in clinical trials ( 17 ) . Here we report the synthesis of SMI # 9 - tethered GNPs using a chemistry that allows intracellular release of SMI # 9 . SMI # 9 - GNPs were characterized for size and ligand conjugation , and intracellular release of conjugated SMI # 9 by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR ) 4 and liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry ( LC - MS / MS ) . Intracellular uptake , localization , cytotoxicity and molecular responses to SMI # 9 - GNP were evaluated in triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) cells as TNBCs represent a heterogeneous disease with poor clinical outcomes and few targeted therapy options as they lack estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor and Her2 / neu amplification . We analyzed the responses to conjugated and free SMI # 9 in mesenchymal and basal subtypes as they represent the two major TNBC subtypes ( 18 ) . We show that the mesenchymal subtype is sensitive to SMI # 9 - GNP and that modified SMI # 9 released from GNP acts similarly to unconjugated parent SMI # 9 . Methods Synthesis of gold nanoparticle ( GNP ) and conjugation of Rad6 inhibitor SMI # 9 to GNP SMI # 9 was synthesized as previously described ( 12 ) . The steps for GNP and SMI # 9 nanoconjugation are described in Scheme 1 ( 19 - 23 ) , and details are provided under Supplementary Materials . Characterization of GNP and GNP - drug conjugates SMI # 9 conjugated to GNP was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) on a SDT - Q600 Thermo - Gravity Analyser using air as the supporting gas . The air flow rate was maintained at 100 ml / min , and sample heated from 25 to 800°C at a rate of 10°C / min . GNP solutions were also characterized by UV - vis spectroscopy with a Varian Cary ® 50 spectrometer in 2 mm optical path cells , and by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) at 200 kV with a JEOL JEM - 2010 microscope equipped with a Gatan multiscan CCD camera . TEM samples were prepared by placing a droplet of the GNP solution on a Formvar - coated copper grid . Dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) and zeta potential were measured using a Malvern Nano - ZS . The Z - 5 average hydrodynamic diameter ( HD ) , polydispersity index ( PDI ) , and zeta potential were measured at 25°C . 15 scans were performed in each measurement . The backscattering angle Θ was fixed at 172° with a laser wavelength (cid:540) = 633 nm . The size measurement range was set between 1 nm and 6 (cid:541)m . HD is a function of the diffusion coefficient ( D ) , temperature ( T ) , and viscosity ( η ) according to the Stokes - Einstein equation : D kT HD  3  , k is Boltzmann constant , T is 25 °C , and D was obtained from autocorrelation function via the cumulant fitting . Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) imaging was conducted using a Dimension 3100 AFM from VEECO . AFM tapping mode in liquid was used and the nanoconjugate was deposited on mica by spin coating . Cell survival assay MDA - MB - 231 , SUM - 1315 , MDA - MB - 468 , and HCC1937 TNBC cells ( ATCC ) were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium ( DMEM ) / F - 12 supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum . Nontransformed MCF10A human breast cells were maintained in DMEM / F12 supplemented with 5 % horse serum , 20 ng / ml epidermal growth factor , 10  g / ml insulin , 0 . 5  g / ml hydrocortisone and 0 . 10  g / ml cholera toxin ( 7 ) . SMI # 9 - GNP sensitivity was assessed by trypan blue staining or MTT assay . Cells ( 5 - 7 X 10 3 ) were seeded in 96 - well plates and treated with free SMI # 9 , SMI # 9 - GNP , or blank - GNP at various concentrations in triplicates for 72 h . In some cases , cells were treated singly with 0 . 1 - 10  M cisplatin or in combination with SMI # 9 - GNP . On the final day , medium was replaced with drug - free medium , and incubated with MTT for 2 - 3 h . MTT - formazan crystals were dissolved in 0 . 04 N HCl / isopropanol and absorbance measured at 570 nm using the Synergy 2 microplate reader . Alternately , cultures were 6 trypsinized and cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion using the Biorad TC10 automatic cell counter . At least three independent experiments were performed for each cell line . SMI # 9 and SMI # 9 - GNP uptake and intracellular release of the free drug from GNP conjugate MDA - MB - 231 ( 3 X 10 5 ) cells were plated in 35 mm dishes and exposed to various doses of SMI # 9 - GNP or untreated for 24 - 48 h . Cultures were rinsed , lysed by freeze - thaw cycles in cold hypotonic buffer , and clarified by centrifugation at 10 , 000 g . Aliquots of clarified lysates were analysed by FTIR spectroscopy using control lysates spiked with free SMI # 9 as reference . To determine intracellular release of modified SMI # 9 from nanoparticles , SUM1315 ( 2 X 10 6 cells / 100 mm dish ) cells were exposed for 8 or 24 h to 5  M free SMI # 9 , 5  M SMI # 9 - GNP or the corresponding amount of blank - GNP , or untreated . Cultures were rinsed in ice - cold phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) , lysed with cold 80 % methanol and clarified by centrifugation at 10 , 000 g for 10 min at 4 o C ( 24 ) . Aliquots of supernatants were subjected to high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry ( LC - MS / MS ) analysis . Chromatography was performed with Waters Model 2695 system and Waters Xterra MS C18 column ( 50 x 2 . 1 mm i . d . , 3 . 5 (cid:541)m ) using an isocratic mobile phase of methanol / 0 . 45 % formic acid in water ( 60 : 30 , v / v ) at a flow rate of 0 . 2 mL / min . The column effluent was monitored using a Waters Quattro Micro TM triple quadrupole mass - spectrometric detector . Multiple reaction monitoring at positive ionization mode were chosen for the analyte detection . Mass spectrometric parameters were optimized for detection of SMI # 9 with the cone voltage of 45 V and collision energy of 24 V . Samples were introduced into the ionization source through a heated ne bulized probe ( 350 ˚C ) with 500 L / hr desolvation nitrogen gas flow . For SMI # 9 7 detection , the spectrometer was programmed to monitor transition of the parent ion m / z 366 . 69 ( [ M + H ] + ) to the major daughter ion with m / z 150 . 1 ( Fig . 3A , b ) . For the detection of modified SMI # 9 released from GNP , the spectrometer was programmed to monitor transition of the parent ion m / z 397 . 3 to the major daughter ion m / z 150 . 1 . We monitored 14 MS transitions m / z 366 . 69 > 150 . 1 , 368 . 86 > 150 . 7 , 381 . 3 > 150 . 1 , 381 . 3 > 150 . 7 , 381 . 3 > 232 . 3 , 381 . 3 > 248 . 3 , 397 . 3 > 150 . 1 , 397 . 3 > 150 . 7 , 397 . 3 > 232 . 3 , 397 . 3 > 248 . 3 , 379 . 4 > 150 . 1 , 379 . 4 > 150 . 7 , 379 . 4 > 232 . 3 , and 379 . 4 > 248 . 3 to determine release of modified SMI # 9 from the GNP conjugates . All the chosen parent ions were selected in the first quadrupole and allowed to pass into the collision cell filled with argon gas with a pressure of 0 . 00172 mBar . The dwell time per channel was set to 0 . 01s for data collection . Acridine orange / ethidium bromide staining Breast cancer cells ( 10 x 10 3 ) were seeded on cover slips and treated with vehicle , free SMI # 9 , blank - GNP or SMI # 9 - GNP for 24 - 48 h . Cover slips were rinsed with PBS , stained with ethidium bromide / acridine orange ( each 25  g / ml ) , and immediately imaged with an Olympus BX40 fluorescence microscope . A minimum of six fields with at least 50 cells / field were scored for determination of dye uptake ( 12 ) , and experiments were repeated at least three times . Mitochondrial assay The impact of free SMI # 9 or SMI # 9 - GNP on mitochondrial membrane potential  m ) on SUM1315 and HCC1937 TNBC cells was assessed using JC - 1 ( Mitocapture , Biovision , Mountainview , CA ) , a potentiometric green fluorescent dye that shifts to red fluorescence within mitochondria with a normal negative  m . Briefly , cells were incubated with the MitoCapture reagent for 15 min at 37°C and imaged by fluorescence microscopy ( 25 ) . The percent of cells 8 showing > 5 punctate J - aggregates were scored by counting three - five fields of 50 - 100 cells in each field . To quantitate mitochondrial membrane potential changes , 20 X 10 3 SUM1315 or HCC1937 cells were seeded in 96 - well plate , and treated for 48 h with 5  M SMI # 9 - GNP or blank - GNP . Cells were then incubated with 10  M JC - 1 for 30 - 60 min , and the red and green fluorescence intensities of JC - 1 were measured at Excitation / Emission = 490 / 525 nm and 490 / 590 nm with a Synergy 2 fluorescence reader . Results were expressed as the ratio of red to green fluorescence . Intracellular uptake of SMI # 9 - GNP To examine localization of SMI # 9 - GNP transported into lysosomes , SUM1315 or HCC1937 cells were seeded on sterile coverslips and treated with blank - or SMI # 9 - GNP . Cultures were rinsed and incubated in LysoSensor Green DND - 189 ( 75 nM ) for 30 - 60 min at 37 o C ( 26 ) . Cells were counterstained with 4 ' , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) to localize the nucleus and images were acquired with an Olympus BX40 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Sony high resolution / sensitivity camera . Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis Breast cancer cells treated with vehicle , free SMI # 9 , blank - or SMI # 9 - GNP ( 1 - 5  M ) for 24 - 96 h were lysed ( 12 ) , and aliquots of lysates containing 25  g of protein were subjected to SDS - PAGE and western blot analysis of PARP - 1 ( Cell Signaling ) , Rad6 ( 7 ) , LC3 - I / II ( Cell Signaling ) , p62 ( Cell Signaling ) and  - actin ( Sigma ) . To determine LC3 or p62 subcellular localization , control or SMI # 9 - GNP treated cells were fixed with methanol : acetone ( 1 : 1 , v / v ) and stained with 9 anti - LC3 or anti - p62 antibody . Slides were incubated with FITC - or Texas Red - conjugated anti - rabbit secondary antibody , counterstained with DAPI , and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy . Statistical analysis Each experiment was performed in triplicate and reproduced at least three times . Data are expressed as mean ± S . D , and P < 0 . 05 determined by Student’s t - test was considered to be statistically significant . Results Nanoparticle synthesis and characterization For the production of SMI # 9 - tethered GNPs , citrate - reduced GNPs were synthesized from HAuCl4 . 3H 2 0 and subsequently capped by MSA . Modified SMI # 9 was attached to the MSA - GNP surface via ester bond ( Scheme 1 ) . The chemical compositions of GNP and SMI # 9 - GNP were determined by TGA . Figure 1A shows the TGA curves of MSA - GNP ( blank - GNP ) and MSA - GNP conjugated SMI # 9 ( SMI # 9 - GNP ) with weight loss of 6 . 15 % and 13 % , respectively , at 800°C . The detailed calculations for loading and coverage of modified SMI # 9 on MSA - GNP are provided under Supplementary data . Figure 1B shows the UV - vis spectra of GNPs before and after conjugation with modified SMI # 9 . The surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) absorption peak of freshly prepared GNPs is 508 nm , which corresponds to GNP diameter range of 3 - 5 nm . However , upon conjugation with modified SMI # 9 , the SPR absorption peak broadened and shifted to 524 nm , which is indicative of particle aggregation . The size of SMI # 9 - GNPs was also determined by TEM ( Fig . 1C ) and AFM ( Fig . 1D ) which showed a size of 32 nm and 40 . 2 ± 1 . 4 nm , respectively , that is consistent with aggregation . DLS further verified the average size of 10 SMI # 9 - GNP nanoconjugate at 41 nm as compared to 4 . 8 nm for GNP . The zeta potential of MSA - capped GNP changed from - 41 mV to - 16 . 2 mV after conjugation with SMI # 9 . The decrease in surface charge is the result of SMI # 9 conjugation to highly charged MSA . Particle aggregation could also contribute to surface charge reduction . Intracellular SMI # 9 - GNP uptake and release To determine SMI # 9 - GNP uptake and intracellular release of the conjugated SMI # 9 , MDA - MB - 231 or SUM1315 cells were exposed to SMI # 9 - GNP , blank - GNP , SMI # 9 or untreated , and cell lysates analyzed by FTIR or LC - MS / MS . Control cell lysates spiked with ( parent ) SMI # 9 were included as reference controls . FTIR analysis of SMI # 9 ( Fig . 1E ) , and lysates prepared from SMI # 9 - GNP treated MDA - MB - 231 cells or MDA - MB - 231 control lysates spiked with SMI # 9 showed the characteristic nitro group banding at ~ 1550 cm - 1 , indicative of SMI # 9 presence ( Fig . 1F ) . SMI # 9 was hydroxymethylated to enable conjugation to GNP via an ester bond ( Scheme 1 and Fig . 2A , a ) . Intracellular hydrolysis would result in release of modified SMI # 9 with the molecular weight of 396 . 3 , which would produce parent ions at 397 . 3 ( [ M + H ] + ) and product ions at 150 . 1 ( Fig . 2A , b and c ) . A strong peak was detected under m / z 381 . 3 > 150 . 1 transition ( but not under 397 . 3 > 150 . 1 ) at both 8 and 24 h in SMI # 9 - GNP treated cells that was not detected in blank - GNP or untreated control cultures ( Fig . 2C ) . Release of drug with 381 . 3 molecular mass could arise by dehydroxylation of hydroxymethylated - SMI # 9 . The precise structure of intracellularly released drug and its metabolic processing is under investigation . The peak signals were stronger at 8 h as compared to 24 h , suggesting rapid intracellular processing . The positive control cells treated with free ( parent ) SMI # 9 showed the expected peak under m / z 366 . 69 > 11 150 . 1 transition ( Fig . 2B ) . These results suggest efficient uptake and rapid intracellular processing of the chemically modified SMI # 9 - GNP conjugates . Cellular response to SMI # 9 - conjugated GNP The sensitivities of MDA - MB - 231 , SUM1315 , HCC1937 , and MDA - MB - 468 TNBC cells , and nontransformed MCF10A human breast cells to SMI # 9 - GNP as compared to blank - GNP or free ( parent ) SMI # 9 were determined by MTT or trypan blue staining assays . Whereas all TNBC cell lines are growth inhibited by free SMI # 9 with GI50s for MDA - MB - 231 , SUM1315 , HCC1937 and MDA - MB - 468 of 5  M , 6  M , 1 . 8  M and 3  M , respectively , these cell lines display variable sensitivities to SMI # 9 - GNP ( Fig . 3A - 3D ) . Blank - GNP added at amounts equivalent to 1 or 10  M SMI # 9 - GNP demonstrated negligible cytotoxicity in all four lines . MCF10A cells were unaffected by free SMI # 9 ( 12 ) and SMI # 9 - GNP ( Fig . 3E ) . Among the TNBC lines , SUM1315 cells displayed greatest sensitivity to SMI # 9 - GNP with GI50 ( based on SMI # 9 concentration ) of ~ 0 . 5  M as compared to 8 . 2  M for MDA - MB - 231 cells . Both HCC1937 and MDA - MB - 468 cells were unaffected by SMI # 9 - GNP . Consistent with the MTT assay results , simultaneous phase - contrast imaging showed drug - induced morphologic transformations in the sensitized cells ( Fig . 3G ) . In HCC1937 ( and MDA - MB - 468 , data not shown ) cells that are unaffected by SMI # 9 - GNP , the GNPs appeared to aggregate at the cell surface ( Fig . 3G ) . When combined with cisplatin , however , SMI # 9 - GNP synergistically increased cisplatin sensitivity of MDA - MB - 468 and HCC1937 cells ( Fig . 3F ) . These data suggest that once imported into the cells , SMI # 9 - GNP is therapeutically active in basal subtype TNBC cells . 12 SMI # 9 - GNP sensitivity is associated with apoptosis Since MTT assays ( Fig . 3A - 3D ) showed variable SMI # 9 - GNP induced growth inhibitory effects in the TNBC lines , we verified whether these sensitivities resulted from cytostatic or cytotoxic responses . Cells undergoing apoptosis / necrosis were detected by the differential uptake of the fluorescent DNA binding dyes acridine orange and ethidium bromide . Consistent with MTT data ( Fig . 3A ) , SMI # 9 and SMI # 9 - GNP treatments triggered morphological changes consistent with apoptosis in SUM1315 cells ( Fig . 4A ) . Early apoptosis marked by intercalated acridine orange within fragmented DNA ( 27 ) and late stages of apoptosis marked by apoptotic body separation and presence of reddish - orange color due to acridine orange binding to fragmented DNA ( 28 ) were observed in SUM1315 cells treated with SMI # 9 - GNP ( Fig . 4A , 4C ) . SUM1315 cells treated with blank - GNP ( at amounts equivalent to 5  M SMI # 9 - GNP ) were minimally affected as > 98 % of the cells showed a green intact nuclear structure ( Fig . 4A , 4C ) . Acridine orange / ethidium bromide staining of MDA - MB - 231 cells showed similar SMI # 9 - GNP induced morphological changes ( data not shown ) . Consistent with the MTT data ( Fig . 3C ) , acridine orange / ethidium bromide staining showed morphological alterations consistent with apoptosis in SMI # 9 - treated but not SMI # 9 - GNP treated , confirming SMI # 9 - GNP insensitivity of HCC1937 cells ( Fig . 4B , 4D ) . SMI # 9 - GNP sensitive TNBC cells show altered mitochondrial membrane potential Since the results of acridine orange / ethidium bromide staining showed dye uptake consistent with apoptosis in SMI # 9 - GNP sensitive cells , we tested whether this occurred by a mitochondrial - regulated mechanism . Alterations in mitochondrial transmembrane potential were evaluated in SUM1315 and HCC1937 cells treated with free SMI # 9 , blank - GNP , or SMI # 9 - GNP 13 using the JC - 1 assay .  m is a marker of mitochondrial function and is used to monitor loss of mitochondrial function . JC - 1 ( 5 , 5’ , 6 , 6’ - tetrachloro - 1 , 1’ , 3 , 3’ - tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocynane iodide ) is a lipophilic cationic dye which depending upon  m accumulates in the cytoplasm as a green monomer or as punctate red aggregates in hyperpolarized mitochondria of cancer cells ( 29 ) . The negative charge established by the mitochondrial membrane potential allows the lipophilic cationic dye to enter mitochondria where it accumulates ( 30 ) . When a critical concentration is exceeded , J - aggregates form , which fluoresces red . In apoptotic cells ,  m collapses , and the JC - 1 is unable to accumulate in mitochondria . JC - 1 thus remains in the cytoplasm as a green fluorescent monomer . Untreated or blank - GNP treated control SUM1315 and HCC1937 cells show heterogeneous punctate red and green fluorescence ( Fig . 4E , 4F ) . Overnight treatment with 1  M free SMI # 9 reduced J - aggregate formation in both SUM1315 and HCC1937 cells ( Fig . 4E , 4F ) . Mitochondrial membrane depolarization consistent with a shift in fluorescence emission of JC - 1 from red to green , and occasional cells with mislocalized punctate red signals were observed in SMI # 9 - treated HCC1937 cells ( Fig . 4F ) . However , consistent with MTT and acridine orange / ethidium bromide staining data ,  m of HCC1937 cells were unaffected by SMI # 9 - GNP treatment ( Figs . 4F ) . In contrast , the mitochondrial integrities of SUM1315 cells treated with free SMI # 9 and SMI # 9 - GNP were similarly and dramatically compromised ( Figs . 4E ) . Quantitation of mitochondrial activity by manual scoring of J - aggregates ( Figs . 4G , 4H ) and fluorescence measurements of red and green forms of JC - 1 ( Fig . 4I ) further confirmed that SMI # 9 - induced cell death occurs from loss of mitochondrial function , and importantly free and conjugated SMI # 9 behave similarly to inhibit mitochondrial function and cell viability . 14 Lysosomal uptake of SMI # 9 - GNP Since SUM1315 and HCC1937 breast cancer cells displayed different sensitivities to SMI # 9 - GNP while maintaining similar cellular sensitivities to free SMI # 9 , we hypothesized that these variations arose from differences in uptake rather than intracellular processing as combination with cisplatin enhanced SMI # 9 - GNP uptake and cisplatin sensitivity ( Fig . 3F ) . Internalization of nanoparticles in general is accomplished by endocytosis , transfer of cargo to early and mature endosomes , and fusion to become late endosomes / lysosomes ( 31 - 33 ) . Control or SMI # 9 - GNP treated SUM1315 or HCC1937 cells were stained with LysoSensor Green DND - 189 to label the lysosomes and the presence of aggregated GNP cargo examined . LysoSensor Green DND - 189 is an acidotropic dye that accumulates in intracellular acidic organelles as a result of protonation and has a fluorescence intensity that is proportional to acidity ( 34 , 35 ) . SMI # 9 - GNP is efficiently internalized into SUM1315 cells as evidenced by the presence of GNP aggregates in lysosomes marked by the LysoSensor Green DND - 189 dye ( Fig . 5B ) . The overlapping of lysosomes with GNP aggregates and the strong sensitivity of SUM1315 cells to SMI # 9 - GNP suggest potential hydrolysis of the ester bond linked SMI # 9 - GNP and release of conjugated SMI # 9 as supported by LC - MS / MS ( Fig . 2 ) . Although both control and SMI # 9 - GNP treated SUM1315 cells showed robust staining with the lysosomal marker ( Fig . 5A and 5B ) , formation of “acidic vesicles” ( potentially indicative of autolysosome formation , a key feature of autophagy ) , was observed only in SMI # 9 - GNP treated SUM1315 cells ( compare Figs . 5 A’ and 5 B’ ) . In contrast , HCC1937 cells showed weak staining with LysoSensor Green ( Fig . 5C and 5D ) suggesting weak acidification . 15 SMI # 9 - induced cell death is associated with PARP - 1 stabilization Since SMI # 9 treatment induces apoptosis by causing mitochondrial dysfunction , we analyzed the steady - state levels of PARP - 1 protein in TNBC cells treated for 24 h with vehicle , free SMI # 9 , blank - GNP or SMI # 9 - GNP . As shown in Fig . 6A , each cell line displayed unique PARP - 1 processing blueprints , which was unaffected by blank - GNP and SMI # 9 - GNP . However , treatment with free SMI # 9 for 24 h resulted in PARP - 1 stabilization / hyperactivation . Accumulation of PARP - 1 containing heterogeneous chain lengths of poly ADP - ribose ( PARylated PARP - 1 ) was observed in all cell lines , and appear to result from alterations in PARP - 1 processing ( Fig . 6A ) . Since 24 h treatment with SMI # 9 - GNP did not evoke similar changes in PARP - 1 , we performed PARP - 1 analysis in SUM1315 cells treated with SMI # 9 - GNP for 24 - 96 h . The results in Fig . 6B show that like free SMI # 9 , SMI # 9 - GNP also induces PARP - 1 activation as evidenced by time - dependent accumulation of high molecular weight PARP - 1 forms after 24 h . These data suggest that both free and conjugated SMI # 9 exert similar molecular effects on PARP - 1 activation ; however , GNP - conjugated SMI # 9 requires longer time to elicit this effect . The conversion of the soluble form of LC3 ( LC3 - I ) to the lipidated and autophagosome - associated form ( LC3 - II ) is considered a hallmark of autophagy ( 36 ) . High basal levels of LC3 - I and LC3 - II were observed in MDA - MB - 231 cells compared to SUM1315 cells , suggesting the involvement of autophagic flux in normal survival of these cells ( Fig . 6B ) . Treatment for 24 h with free SMI # 9 but not SMI # 9 - GNP downregulated both LC3 - I and LC3 - II in MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Fig . 6B ) . Although changes in LC3 - I processing was not readily apparent in SUM1315 cells treated for 24 h with free SMI # 9 or SMI # 9 - GNP , a dramatic increase in LC3 - I to LC3 - II conversion that was commensurate with PARP - 1 hyperactivation was observed at 48 and 96 h of 16 treatment ( Fig . 6B ) . These effects are selective for SMI # 9 - GNP since treatment with blank - GNP for up to 96 h produced no changes in LC - 3 - I / II ratios or PARP - 1 activation ( Fig . 6B ) . p62 is degraded through the autophagy - lysosomal pathway and is mediated by interaction with LC3 ( 37 , 38 ) . Concomitant with SMI # 9 - GNP - induced increases in LC3 - I to LC3 - II conversion , p62 protein steady - state levels were decreased confirming autophagy induction ( Fig . 1 in Supplementary Results ) . Consistent with these data , LC3 - positive dots were detected by immunofluorescence staining only in SMI # 9 - GNP treated SUM1315 cells ( Fig . 6D , arrow ) , whereas strongly stained p62 - positive bodies were detected in control cells but not in SMI # 9 - GNP treated cells ( Fig . 6E ) . The coincident increases in PARP - 1 hyperactivation , LC - I to LC3 - II conversion , and p62 decrease in SMI # 9 - GNP treated cells signify cell death that is further supported by MTT assays ( Fig . 3A ) , phase - contrast micrographs ( Figs . 3G , 6C ) , and the presence of lysosome - associated acidic vesicles ( Fig . 5 B’ , arrows ) in SMI # 9 - GNP treated but not control cells . Rad6 steady - state levels were marginally increased in SMI # 9 - GNP treated cells ( Fig . 6B ) . Since Rad6 activity is inhibited under these conditions , these data suggest an important role for Rad6 activity in assuring survival of cancer cells . Discussion In this paper , we have developed a GNP - based vehicle for delivering SMI # 9 , and demonstrated that the tethered chemically modified SMI # 9 is released from GNP and that it acts similar to the parent SMI # 9 . Whereas both basal and mesenchymal subtypes of TNBCs are sensitized by free ( parent ) SMI # 9 , we discovered that unlike the mesenchymal TNBC subtype ( SUM1315 and MDA - MB - 231 ) cells that are sensitive to SMI # 9 - GNP , the basal TNBC subtype 17 ( MDA - MB - 468 and HCC1937 ) cells are refractory to SMI # 9 - GNP . We show that the higher efficacy of SMI # 9 - GNP in SUM1315 and MDA - MB - 231 cells results from efficient endocytosis and lysosomal processing of SMI # 9 - tethered GNP . SMI # 9 - GNP uptake and cellular response are compromised in HCC1937 and MDA - MB - 468 cells due to aggregation at the cell surface . Theoretical models predict the optimal diameter for GNP uptake to be ~ 50 nm in receptor - mediated endocytosis ( 39 - 41 ) . The larger aggregates found in HCC1937 and MDA - MB - 468 cells may require more interactions to enable wrapping of membrane around the aggregates ( 39 , 40 , 42 ) . It should be noted that although all TNBC cells were cultured under similar conditions and with similar amounts of SMI # 9 - GNP , SMI # 9 - GNP aggregation occurred only in the basal subtype , suggesting local microenvironment involvement in particle aggregation . These data are corroborated by LysoSensor Green DND - 189 staining which showed SMI # 9 - GNP localization in strongly fluorescing lysosomes of SUM1315 cells , whereas similar staining of HCC1937 and MDA - MB - 468 cells showed weak LysoSensor Green fluorescence . LysoSensor Green DND - 189 is an acidotropic dye that accumulates in intracellular acidic organelles as a result of protonation and has a fluorescence intensity that is proportional to acidity ( 34 , 35 ) . Ma et al . ( 43 ) recently reported a GNP size - dependent alkalinization of lysosomes , which is consistent with the presence of large SMI # 9 - GNP aggregates and weak fluorescence of LysoSensor Green DND - 189 dye in HCC1937 and MDA - MB - 468 cells . On a broad scale , we observed that in the mesenchymal TNBC subtype where SMI # 9 - GNP exists in a monodispersed or lower order of aggregation , SMI # 9 - GNP is endocytosed efficiently and hydrolyzed to release the conjugated drug . Although SMI # 9 - GNP uptake is impaired in basal subtype TNBC cells , when combined with cisplatin treatment SMI # 9 - GNP is effectively imported as it synergistically enhances cisplatin sensitivity . These data implicate the universal 18 applicability of SMI # 9 - GNP in treatment of TNBCs as treatment regimens generally employ combination therapies . Rad6 is overexpressed in TNBC cells and expressed weakly in normal cells ( 6 , 44 ) . Since MCF10A cells are unaffected by both free and GNP - conjugated SMI # 9 suggests that SMI # 9 - GNP may be used to deliver therapy to cancer cells while sparing the normal cells . Our mechanistic studies show that both SMI # 9 and SMI # 9 - GNP induce apoptosis by affecting mitochondrial integrity . A role for Rad6 in the maintenance of healthy mitochondria was recently reported ( 45 ) . Here the authors showed that the UBC activity of Rad6A in combination with Parkin E3 ubiquitin ligase ubiquitinates mitochondrial proteins to facilitate autophagic clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria ( 45 ) . Patient derived human Rad6A mutant cells with defective UBC activity had accumulation of defective mitochondria ( 45 ) . Since SMI # 9 targets Rad6 UBC activity , and cells treated with free or GNP - tethered SMI # 9 show accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria not only corroborate Rad6 role in mitochondrial function but also provide mechanistic evidence for SMI # 9 - GNP functionality . Treatment of TNBC cells with SMI # 9 induces apoptosis , autophagy and necrosis . Based on our data , we have formulated a model ( Fig . 7 ) that could explain cell death caused by Rad6 inhibition . Rad6 along with Parkin facilitates the removal of dysfunctional mitochondria by autophagy . Thus the low levels of autophagy in control cells promote cell survival by eliminating damaged organelles and preventing apoptosis . SMI # 9 treatment causes accumulation of damaged mitochondria which triggers upregulation of autophagy , an attempt by the cells to clear damaged organelles and rescue cell survival . However , excessive autophagy combined with mitochondrial permeabilization induces apoptosis as it promotes the release of apoptogenic factors involved in caspase - dependent or caspase - independent cell death . Our study showed that in both SMI # 9 - and 19 SMI # 9 - GNP - induced apoptosis , PARP - 1 cleavage is not observed . Rather PARP - 1 is stabilized / hyperactivated indicating caspase - independent apoptosis ( 46 - 48 ) and necrosis from energy depletion ( 49 , 50 ) . Since both Rad6 loss ( 45 ) and PARP - 1 hyperactivation ( 51 ) are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction , and inhibition of Rad6 by SMI # 9 induces both mitochondrial dysfunction and PARP - 1 activation , our data implicate a potential novel role for Rad6 linking these processes . In summary , the mechanistic data presented here show that GNP is a suitable vehicle for delivering SMI # 9 and that the chemically modified SMI # 9 released from GNP functions similarly as the free parent SMI # 9 . Our data also show distinct differences in uptake and tolerability of SMI # 9 - GNP between basal and mesenchymal subtypes of TNBC cells that emanate from cell - specific microenvironment - induced effects on SMI # 9 - GNP aggregation . Although the SMI # 9 - GNP aggregates are nontoxic , these data are significant because it illustrates how cell microenvironments can induce alterations in the physical properties of GNP - drug conjugates and influence their anti - cancer efficacies .
