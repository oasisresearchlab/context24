Cellular Traction Stresses Increase with Increasing Metastatic Potential Casey M . Kraning - Rush , Joseph P . Califano , Cynthia A . Reinhart - King * Department of Biomedical Engineering , Cornell University , Ithaca , New York , United States of America Abstract Cancer cells exist in a mechanically and chemically heterogeneous microenvironment which undergoes dynamic changes throughout neoplastic progression . During metastasis , cells from a primary tumor acquire characteristics that enable them to escape from the primary tumor and migrate through the heterogeneous stromal environment to establish secondary tumors . Despite being linked to poor prognosis , there are no direct clinical tests available to diagnose the likelihood of metastasis . Moreover , the physical mechanisms employed by metastatic cancer cells to migrate are poorly understood . Because metastasis of most solid tumors requires cells to exert force to reorganize and navigate through dense stroma , we investigated differences in cellular force generation between metastatic and non - metastatic cells . Using traction force microscopy , we found that in human metastatic breast , prostate and lung cancer cell lines , traction stresses were significantly increased compared to non - metastatic counterparts . This trend was recapitulated in the isogenic MCF10AT series of breast cancer cells . Our data also indicate that increased matrix stiffness and collagen density promote increased traction forces , and that metastatic cells generate higher forces than non - metastatic cells across all matrix properties studied . Additionally , we found that cell spreading for these cell lines has a direct relationship with collagen density , but a biphasic relationship with substrate stiffness , indicating that cell area alone does not dictate the magnitude of traction stress generation . Together , these data suggest that cellular contractile force may play an important role in metastasis , and that the physical properties of the stromal environment may regulate cellular force generation . These findings are critical for understanding the physical mechanisms of metastasis and the role of the extracellular microenvironment in metastatic progression .

Metastasis is the leading cause of death among cancer patients , resulting in over 90 % of cancer - related fatalities [ 2 ] . Moreover , there is currently no procedure or test that can definitively determine the metastatic potential of a specific tumor . Clinical oncologists routinely rely on pathology reports and historical statistics to determine patient prognosis and to design a course of palliative therapy [ 3 ] . Because metastasis has become the primary obstacle in cancer treatment , there is a substantial body of work attempting to discover a biological marker ( or set of markers ) for metastasis , but with marginal success [ 4 ] . Previous studies have linked overex - pression of VEGF - D [ 5 ] , urokinase plasminogen activator [ 6 ] , the growth factor receptor CXCR2 [ 7 ] and activator protein - 1 [ 8 ] to increased metastatic breast cancer invasion in vitro and in vivo . Additionally , studies have shown that a combination of genes can affect organ - specific tropism [ 9 ] . However , these discoveries have generally not been applicable to multiple cancer types , or even within subtypes of a single cancer . Recently , advances in genetic profiling have led to the identification of a 17 - gene expression signature for metastasis in primary adenocarcinomas [ 10 ] , as well as a 70 - gene expression signature for predicting the clinical prognosis of breast cancer [ 11 ] . While patients whose tumors contain these expression patterns will benefit from this kind of genetic analysis , it may not be applicable to a broad spectrum of patients with heterogeneous tumor populations . Additionally , while these signatures may show significant statistical correlation with poor prognosis , they are not descriptive of the physical behaviors of the tumor cells that lead to these clinical results . Alterations in gene expression patterns result in phenotypic changes at the cellular level during cancer progression . As such , the biophysical characteristics of tumor cells may be a more appropriate and accessible clinical indicator than individual genetic alterations . During metastatic invasion , cancer cells encounter a complex and constantly evolving microenvironment [ 12 ] consisting of upregulated extracellular matrix proteins [ 10 , 13 , 14 ] , different degrees of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) crosslinking [ 13 ] , mechanical heterogeneity [ 15 , 16 ] , varying oxygen levels [ 17 ] , as well as exposure to shear stress and interstitial pressure [ 12 ] . To successfully navigate this dynamic microenvironment , tumor cells must generate force to reorganize the basement membrane , invade into surrounding stroma [ 18 , 19 ] , PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 February 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 2 | e32572 migrate along ECM fibers [ 20 , 21 ] and transmigrate through the endothelial cell barrier [ 7 ] to enter the circulatory or lympathic system . In addition to enzymatically degrading the ECM with matrix metalloproteinases , metastatic cells can use force to mechanically rearrange their ECM to clear a path for migration [ 18 ] . There is evidence from in vivo imaging that cells use re - oriented fibers as ‘‘train - tracks’’ to guide their migration away from the primary tumor [ 21 ] . Traction forces have previously been shown to mediate normal cell migration [ 22 ] , adhesion [ 23 , 24 ] , mechanotransduction [ 25 ] , and ECM remodeling [ 21 , 26 , 27 ] . Notably , these processes are also involved in cancer progression . Paszek et al . have shown a marked difference in the magnitude and organization of traction stresses between cancerous and untransformed mammary epithelial cells , suggesting inherent differences in cell force generation in the cancerous phenotype [ 15 ] . However , the effects of metastatic potential on force generation have not yet been thoroughly investigated . Matrix stiffness has been shown to have a distinct effect on force - mediated cellular behaviors including migration [ 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 ] , adhesion [ 25 , 32 , 33 ] , and ECM remodeling [ 13 , 18 ] . Because metastasizing cancer cells are exposed to both the increased stiffness of the stroma surrounding most solid tumors , as well as more compliant adipose tissue , it is important to understand the effects of a dynamic mechanical environment on cancer cell force generation . Similarly , ligand density has also been shown to have a significant effect on the force generation of non - cancerous cell types , such as endothelial cells and fibroblasts [ 34 , 35 , 36 ] . During cancer progres - sion , the chemical nature of the extracellular matrix experiences significant changes , affecting the number and nature of binding sites available for tumor cell adhesion and migration . Collagen metabolism has been shown to be dysregulated , with elevated expression , increased deposition , and an increase in collagen crosslinking that contributes to the overall stiffening of the surrounding microenvironment [ 13 ] . These factors lead to an increase in mammographic density , which has been specifically correlated to an increased risk for the development of breast cancer [ 37 ] . An increase in collagen expression has also been clinically linked to metastatic tumors by genetic analysis of tumor biopsies [ 10 ] . Therefore , understanding the independent and interdepen - dent relationships between substrate mechanics , collagen density , and force generation is critical for understanding the mechanism ( s ) driving metastatic progression . In this study , we investigate traction force generation as a biophysical marker of metastatic potential . We quantify contractile forces of highly metastatic breast , prostate , and lung cancer cell lines compared to non - tumorigenic epithelial cell lines seeded on substrates of varying stiffness and collagen density using traction force microscopy . Here , we show that highly metastatic cancer cells exert significantly increased forces across all matrix properties studied . Moreover , our data show that increased matrix stiffness and collagen density both promote increased traction forces . These findings provide the first evidence to our knowledge that differential force profiles of metastatic cells may aid in determining metastatic potential . Methods Cell culture MCF10A mammary epithelial cells ( American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) , Rockville , MD ) were maintained in Dulbec - co’s Modified Eagle’s Media supplemented with 5 % horse serum , 20 ng / mL EGF ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , 10 m g / mL insulin , 0 . 5 m g / mL hydrocortisone , 100 ng / mL cholera toxin ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) , and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( Invitro - gen ) [ 38 ] . MDAMB231 highly metastatic breast adenocarcinoma cells ( ATCC ) were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) . PC3 highly metastatic prostate adeno - carcinoma cells ( ATCC ) were maintained in Kaighn’s Modifica - tion of Ham’s F - 12 Medium ( ATCC ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) . PrEC primary human prostate epithelial cells ( Lonza , Walkersville , MD ) were maintained in PrEGM prostate epithelial cell growth medium ( Lonza ) supplemented with SingleQuots ( Lonza ) accord - ing to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol . BEAS2B bronchial epithelial cells ( ATCC ) were maintained in BEBM bronchial epithelial cell basal medium ( Lonza ) supplemented with SingleQuots ( Lonza ) according to ATCC recommended protocol , and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) . A549 metastatic lung carcinoma cells ( ATCC ) were kindly provided by Paraskevi Giannakakou ( Weill Cornell Medical College ) and were main - tained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 1 % penicillin - streptomycin , and 1 m g / mL puromycin ( Invitrogen ) . MCF10AT1 transformed mammary epithelial cells and MCF10CA1a metastatic mammary epithelial cells were obtained from the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute ( Detroit , MI ) and were maintained in 1 : 1 Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Media / F12 supplemented with 5 % horse serum , 20 ng / mL EGF ( Invitrogen ) , 10 m g / mL insulin , 0 . 5 m g / mL hydrocortisone , 100 ng / mL cholera toxin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) [ 39 ] . All cells were cultured at 37 u C and 5 % CO 2 . Live cell imaging was performed in a custom temperature , humidity , and CO 2 - controlled stage of a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1m inverted phase contrast microscope with a Hamamatsu ORCA - ER camera . Substrate synthesis and traction force microscopy Substrates of various Young’s moduli ( 1 – 10 kPa ) were synthe - sized with varying ratios of 3 – 7 . 5 % acrylamide ( 40 % w / v solution , Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) and 0 . 1 – 0 . 35 % N , N 9 - methylene - bis - acrylamide ( 2 % w / v solution , Bio - Rad ) as described previously [ 24 , 40 ] . Substrate surfaces were functionalized using N - 6 - ( ( acryloyl ) amido ) hexanoic acid , synthesized in our lab [ 34 ] , covalently bound to 0 . 0001 – 0 . 1 mg / mL type I rat - tail collagen ( Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) . The Young’s modulus ( E ) of the polyacrylamide substrates was verified as previously described [ 32 , 34 , 40 ] . Traction force microscopy ( TFM ) was also performed as previously described [ 40 , 41 , 42 ] . Briefly , cells were seeded on polyacrylamide substrates ( E = 1 – 10 kPa ) embedded with 0 . 5 - m m fluorescent beads and allowed to adhere overnight . Cells were then imaged in phase and bead distributions were imaged in fluorescence before and after removal of the cell with trypsin . Bead displacement within the substrate was tracked with correlation - based optical flow and converted into a strain field . These strain fields were converted into traction stresses using the LIBTRC analysis library developed by Professor Micah Dembo of Boston University , who invented the basic theory that underlies TFM [ 41 ] . Images were processed with LIBTRC software to determine the cellular traction vectors , T , the total magnitude of the force , | F | , and the projected cell area . | F | is an integral of the traction field over the entire area of the cell , D F D ~ ðð T 2 x x , y ð Þ z T 2 y x , y ð Þ (cid:2) (cid:3) 1 = 2 dxdy ð 1 Þ where T x , y ð Þ ~ T x x , y ð Þ , T y x , y ð Þ (cid:4) (cid:5) is the continuous field of local traction vectors defined at local spatial coordinates ( x , y ) in the Metastatic Cells Exert Increased Traction Force PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 February 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 2 | e32572 projected cell area [ 35 ] . More than 40 cells were analyzed per condition . Statistical tests Data were compared with analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and with post - hoc Tukey’s Honestly Significantly Different ( HSD ) test or Student’s t test where appropriate in JMP software ( v . 8 , SAS , Cary , NC ) . All data were logarithmically transformed prior to analysis to ensure normal distribution . All data are reported as mean 6 standard error of the mean ( SEM ) . Results Metastatic cancer cells exert stronger traction forces To investigate the relationship between cellular traction force generation and metastatic potential , we examined the differences in traction force generation in three independent cancer models : breast , prostate , and lung cancer . These cancers comprise the three most fatal cancers in both men and women [ 43 ] , with metastatic disease being the ultimate cause of death in over 90 % of these patients [ 2 ] . During metastatic progression , phenotypic changes in cancer cells result in altered adhesion and migration behavior , allowing cells to escape from the tumor mass into surrounding tissue [ 12 ] . Because contractile force is known to mediate these behaviors in normal cells [ 23 , 24 ] , we hypothesized that cancer cells require increased force generation to metastasize . For each type of cancer , we chose a cell line ( breast , prostate , lung , respectively ) that was previously characterized as highly invasive in vitro and metastatic in vivo ( MDAMB231 , PC3 , and A549 ) , as well as a non - tumorigenic , non - metastatic control cell population that is representative of healthy native epithelial tissue ( MCF10A , PrEC , and BEAS - 2B ) . At a moderate stiffness mimicking tumorigenic conditions in breast tissue ( E = 5 kPa ) [ 15 ] , measurements of cellular force using TFM indicate that MDAMB231 highly metastatic breast cancer cells exhibited stronger traction stresses compared to the non - metastatic MCF10A mammary epithelial cells ( Fig . 1A ) . Likewise , both the PC - 3 highly metastatic prostate cancer cells ( Fig . 1B ) and the A549 metastatic lung cancer cells ( Fig . 1C ) exhibited significantly greater traction stresses than the non - metastatic PrEC primary prostate epithelial cells and the BEAS - 2B lung epithelial cells , respectively . These data suggest that increasing force generation in cells of high metastatic potential may be a biophysical characteristic of metastatic cells that could potentially act as a mechanical marker for metastasis . Substrate stiffness and collagen density mediate magnitude of traction force Because cancer cells encounter heterogeneous environments exhibiting a range of stiffness during metastatic progression in vivo , such as stiff , matrix - dense regions near the tumor and compliant adipose tissue during stromal invasion [ 15 ] , we measured the traction forces exerted on substrates of varying stiffness ( E = 1 – 10 kPa ) , with collagen density being held constant ( 0 . 1 mg / mL ) . We found that , in addition to exerting greater forces on substrates of tumorigenic stiffness ( Fig . 1A ) , MDAMB231 cells also have a greater overall net traction force ( | F | ) than MCF10A cells when cultured on substrates of higher stiffness ( E = 10 kPa , Fig . 2A ) . This trend was also recapitulated with the prostate and lung cancer models , in which the metastatic PC3 ( Fig . 2B ) and A549 ( Fig . 2C ) prostate and lung cancer cells exerted significantly greater forces than non - metastatic PrEC and BEAS2B cells on stiff substrates . On more compliant substrates ( E = 1 kPa ) , the metastatic cells of each cancer type studied exert slightly higher forces than their non - metastatic counterparts . Additionally , we observed a significant increase in net traction force with increasing substrate stiffness within all 6 cell lines ( p , 0 . 01 ) , suggesting that the stiffness of the environment surrounding cancer cells can directly contribute to the amount of traction force exerted at a single cell level . These data indicate that the stiffness of the microenvironment significantly affects the magnitude of forces generated by metastatic and non - metastatic cells , and suggest that , in general , metastatic cells are able to exert greater net traction forces than non - metastatic cells . Collagen content of the microenvironment also changes throughout neoplastic progression [ 13 ] , with increased collagen expression particularly noted in clinical analyses of high grade tumors [ 10 ] . As such , we examined the effect of collagen density on cancer cell traction forces . Using substrates of constant stiffness ( E = 5 kPa ) and varying collagen density ( 0 . 0001 – 0 . 1 mg / mL ) , we found that metastatic MDAMB231 breast cancer cells exert a greater net traction force ( | F | ) than non - metastatic MCF10A cells across the entire range of collagen densities tested ( Fig . 3A ) . This trend is recapitulated with both the prostate and the lung cells , with metastatic PC3 ( Fig . 3B ) and A549 ( Fig . 3C ) prostate and lung cancer cells exerting greater forces than their non - metastatic counterparts , PrEC and BEAS2B cells , on substrates with varying collagen density . Similar to the previously observed trend of increasing force with increasing stiffness , all 6 cell lines also showed a significant increase ( p , 0 . 01 ) in net traction force with increasing collagen density , suggesting that increased collagen content within the tumor microenvironment can also drive force generation of cancer cells . Together these data indicate that metastatic and non - metastatic cells have differential force profiles that are significantly affected by mechanical and chemical matrix properties of the tumor microenvironment . Differences in force generation are not correlated to differences in cell spreading Because cellular force generation has been linked to cell spread area in previous studies [ 34 , 36 ] , we assessed whether increased cellular traction force in metastatic cells on both stiff matrices and those displaying high densities of collagen was simply caused by an increase in cell area ( i . e . that larger cells exert higher forces ) . The area of isolated cells was measured during the TFM experiments previously described . We observed no significant or consistent trend when comparing the spreading area of metastatic breast , prostate , and lung cancer cells to their non - metastatic epithelial cell counterparts across substrates of constant collagen density and varying stiffness ( Fig . 4A ) or across substrates of constant stiffness and varying collagen density ( Fig . 4B ) ( p . 0 . 05 ) . These data indicate that the observed increases in traction force in metastatic versus non - metastatic cells are not linked to cell area . Interestingly , we noted that five of the six cell lines ( excluding the non - metastatic PrEC prostate epithelial cells ) exhibited a biphasic relationship with substrate stiffness , with the maximum cell spreading area occurring on polyacrylamide substrates of an intermediate stiffness ( E = 5 kPa ) ( Fig . 4A ) . In contrast , we observed that these same five cell lines exhibited a direct relationship between spreading area and collagen density across the range of 0 . 0001 – 0 . 1 mg / mL , with increased area correlating with increased collagen density ( Fig . 4B ) . To further investigate the role of cell area in the generation of traction forces , we analyzed the net traction force ( | F | ) of each cell normalized by its projected area ( | F | / A ) as a measurement of average traction stress . When the traction forces of cells plated on Metastatic Cells Exert Increased Traction Force PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 3 February 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 2 | e32572 substrates of variable stiffness were normalized by their respective areas , average traction stress increased with increasing stiffness ( p , 0 . 0001 , Fig . 5A ) . Therefore , the increased force on stiffer substrates is not due to increased cell spreading . However , the average traction stress of cells plated on substrates of variable collagen density revealed an overall equalization of forces across the collagen concentrations tested ( Fig . 5B ) . These data suggest that increased collagen density may promote force generation by causing an increase in cell spreading . Metastatic cells exert increased force in an isogenic model Because the cell lines used in these experiments are of genetically distinct lineages , we further investigated our hypoth - esis that metastatic cells generated increased traction forces compared to non - metastatic cells using an isogenic cell model : the 10AT series of cell lines . The 10AT series consists of several well - characterized cell lines which represent the full spectrum of Figure 1 . Metastatic cancer cells exert greater forces than non - metastatic cells .

We focused on the MCF10AT1 and MCF10CA1a lines [ 39 , 44 , 45 ] , compared to their parental spontaneously immortalized MCF10A cells used previously in this work . MCF10AT1 cells were derived from MCF10A cells transfected with the constitutively active Ha - ras oncogene . These cells are considered ‘premalignant’ and will first form simple ducts in nude mice xenografts , followed by benign lesions which occasionally progress to carcinomas [ 44 ] . MCF10CA1a cells were selectively derived from the MCF10AT1 carcinoma populations . These cells form undifferentiated carcinomas and rapidly growing metastases within the lungs [ 39 , 44 , 45 ] . Together , the MCF10A , MCF10AT1 , and MCF10CA1a are isogenic human cell lines representative of different stages of metastatic potential : non - tumorigenic , premalignant , and highly metastatic ( Fig . 6A ) . The highly metastatic MCF10CA1a derivative exerted significantly greater traction forces compared to the benign MCF10AT1 and Figure 4 . Cell area is differentially altered by matrix stiffness and collagen density . Projected cell area shows a biphasic relationship with substrate stiffness ( A ) and a direct relationship with collagen density ( B ) in the majority of the metastatic ( black ) and non - metastatic cells ( white ) studied .

When the net traction force was normalized by projected area , there was a significant increasing trend in average traction stress ( p , 0 . 001 , Fig . 6D ) . Overall , these data from an isogenic cell model correlate well with the data from breast , prostate , and lung cells derived from different genetic backgrounds ( Fig . 1 ) . Discussion To date , there is no universal molecular marker of metastasis . Because of the known role of cellular force in cell migration , we explored traction force generation as a potential biophysical marker characteristic of cells with metastatic ability . The results presented here show that highly invasive breast , prostate , and lung cancer cells exert significantly greater traction forces than their Figure 5 . Average traction stress increases with stiffness , not collagen density . | F | of each cell is normalized by its projected area ( | F | / A ) as a measurement of average traction stress . Average traction stresses increase with increasing substrate stiffness ( A ) but become relatively uniform with increasing collagen density ( B ) in both metastatic ( black ) and non - metastatic ( white ) cells studied . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0032572 . g005 Metastatic Cells Exert Increased Traction Force PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 7 February 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 2 | e32572 non - invasive epithelial cell counterparts on 2D substrates of physiologically relevant stiffness and varying collagen density . These findings indicate that inherent force differences exist in cells of differing metastatic potential . Additionally , increased matrix stiffness and ligand density promote increased contractile force generation in contrasting ways : collagen density appears to lead to increased cellular force generation by directly mediating cell spreading , while matrix stiffness appears to increase cell forces independently of cell spreading . Previous studies by others have also explored various biophys - ical traits as potential markers of metastasis . Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and optical stretching measurements have shown that metastatic cancer cells are more compliant than benign cells , both in established cell lines [ 46 , 47 ] and in primary tumor samples [ 48 ] . These data allow speculation that a difference in the plasticity of cancer cells may contribute to their enhanced migration away from the primary tumor by allowing them to more easily maneuver through the ECM . These studies are the first indications that there are mechanical properties inherent in some cancer cells that may promote malignant and metastatic behavior . In our study , we explore another aspect of cell mechanics , cellular force generation , to show that metastatic cancer cells from a variety of cancer types exert greater traction stresses than their non - metastatic counterparts . We speculate that these higher forces could potentially drive cancer progression by promoting cellular behaviors such as cell migration , adhesion , and ECM remodeling during metastatic invasion . Cellular mechanical properties can also be affected by the microenvironment . Using particle - tracking microrheology , Baker et al . showed that cells embedded in 3D matrices are stiffer than those plated on 2D substrates [ 29 ] . They also show that 3D matrix stiffness and collagen density significantly affect the intracellular tension in tumor cells , although this relationship is dependent on both the type of cell and the cell’s transformation state [ 29 , 49 ] . Increased matrix stiffness in turn has been shown to enhance cell motility in 2D and 3D [ 28 , 30 ] , while decreasing the stiffness of the tumor microenvironment has been shown to inhibit malignant progression [ 13 , 15 ] . Increased ECM density has been identified as a risk factor for breast cancer [ 37 ] , and has also been shown to promote invasion by enhancing integrin clustering , upregulating Rho and PI3 kinase activity , and increasing focal adhesion formation [ 13 , 15 ] . Recently , Levental et . al . has shown that inhibiting collagen crosslinking increases tumor latency , reduces cell proliferation , and reduces tumor volume and incidence in a mouse model [ 13 ] . In this work , we have shown that matrix stiffness and collagen density both mediate cellular force generation , with cells exerting greater force on substrates with either increased stiffness or increased collagen density . Since both matrix stiffness and ligand density have been associated with increased cell spreading [ 34 , 35 , 36 , 50 , 51 ] , we examined their effects on cell spreading area here . We find that in the majority of the cell lines employed in this study , there existed a biphasic relationship between cell spreading and substrate stiffness ( Fig . 4A ) , but a direct relationship between cell spreading and collagen density ( Fig . 4B ) . While the relationship between area and Figure 6 . Metastatic derivative in a series of isogenic cell lines exerts greater forces .

( C ) Average traction stress ( | F | / A ) increases with increasing metastatic potential .

However , there has been some evidence reported previously that the effect of matrix stiffness on cell spreading is highly variable and cell type - specific , particularly in cancer cells [ 52 ] . Interestingly , we observe that cells on substrates of increasing stiffness exhibit increased average traction stresses , while cells on substrates of increasing collagen density exhibit no change in average traction stresses ( Fig . 5 ) . We speculate that matrix stiffness is able to promote force generation through a mechanosensing - mechanism which causes an upregulation of contractility - related proteins , while collagen density promotes force generation by controlling the number of available integrin binding sites available to the cell , therefore directly mediating the cell spreading area and allowing larger cells to exert greater forces . Importantly , metastatic cancer cells exert increased force compared to non - metastatic cells regardless of cell spreading area . This suggests increased force generation is inherently tied to the metastatic phenotype regardless of the microenvironment . It is also important to note that while this data is acquired in a 2D environment , previous work in our lab has shown that forces in 2D reflect the forces generated within a 3D environment [ 42 ] . While we chose to focus on three of the most common metastatic cancers ( breast , prostate , and lung ) , we cannot claim that contractile force will be a universal predictor of metastatic behavior without thoroughly characterizing every type of cancer . Indeed , recent work has shown that the method of transformation or exposure to different tumorigenic signals can significantly affect cellular mechanical properties in contrasting ways [ 49 , 53 ] . Additionally , a recent study using a series of murine breast cancer cell lines of increasing metastatic potential observed the reverse trend to our data , showing that cells of increasing metastatic potential exert weaker contractile forces [ 54 ] . While it is an elegant model of metastatic potential , the relevance of mouse - derived cancers to cancers which develop within the human body continues to be disputed [ 55 ] . Based on the data shown in this study , particularly on the work done using the isogenic MCF10AT series of cell lines , we believe that pursuing traction force generation as a mechanical indicator of metastasis could potentially reveal mechanistic details that will lead to a better understanding of the initiation and progression of metastatic cancer . Additionally , examining proteins which are known to play key roles in mediating cell force , such as RhoA , ROCK , or myosin light chain phosphatase , may reveal a protein marker for traction stresses which could be more directly employed clinically to diagnose metastasis . Further studies will be needed on a broader range of cancer cells to determine the applicability of this kind of marker to a wide variety of cancers . In conclusion , we have shown that metastatic cells exert significantly greater traction forces than non - metastatic cells in breast , prostate , and lung cancer models , and that these forces can be driven by the mechanical and chemical properties of the tumor microenvironment . These findings suggest that inherent force differences exist in cells of differing metastatic potential , and that these differences could be developed into a biophysical marker that could be used to determine the likelihood of metastasis . Additionally , our data suggest that identifying a mechanism to therapeutically target cellular force may be a promising avenue for inhibiting metastatic progression .
