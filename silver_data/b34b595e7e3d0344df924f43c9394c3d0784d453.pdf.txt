Carotenoid - dependent coloration has attracted considerable attention in this context , be - cause investing carotenoids in coloration has to be traded off against its physiological functions ; carotenoids are antioxidants and increase immunocompetence . This trade - off is hypothesized to underlie the honesty of carotenoid - dependent coloration , signaling the “handi - cap” of allocating carotenoids away from somatic maintenance to - ward sexual display . Utilizing recent advances in modeling adaptive evolution , we used a comparative approach to investigate the evo - lution of plasma carotenoid levels using a species - level phylogeny of 178 bird species . We ﬁnd that the evolutionary optimum for carot - enoid levels is higher in lineages that evolved carotenoid - dependent coloration , with strong attraction toward this optimum . Hence , ca - rotenoids do not appear to be limiting , given that higher carotenoid levels readily evolve in response to the evolution of carotenoid - dependent coloration . These ﬁndings challenge the assumption that carotenoids are a scarce resource and thus also challenge the hy - pothesis that physiological resource value of carotenoids underlies honesty of carotenoid - dependent traits . Therefore , the comparative evidence suggests that other factors , such as the acquisition and incorporation of carotenoids , are involved in maintaining signal honesty .

Introduction Elaborate sexual ornaments are generally considered to have evolved through sexual selection , either to attract the opposite sex or for use in intrasexual competition ( Anders - son and Iwasa 1996 ) . Mate choice for elaborate sexual ornamentation can provide direct and indirect ﬁtness ben - eﬁts ( Kokko et al . 2006 ) , with the choice of an attractive * Corresponding author ; e - mail : mirresimons @ gmail . com . † These authors contributed equally to this work .

Indirect beneﬁts ( the gain of at - tractive offspring via choice for an average preferred phe - notype ; Maan and Seehausen 2011 ) can cause ornaments to evolve via Fisherian runaway selection ( Fisher 1930 ) , resulting in trait exaggeration , until either a trait is ﬁxed in the population or costs underlying further exaggeration allow the trait to evolve into an indicator trait . Mate choice for indicator traits is expected to evolve only if cheating is precluded , which can be achieved by the ﬁtness costs of developing or maintaining such traits . These costs can arise from energetic or resource investment in the orna - ment ( Zahavi 1975 ; Grafen 1990 ) or a suite of other mech - anisms ( e . g . , social punishment ; reviewed in Sza´mado´ 2011 ) . The nature of the costs that maintain signal honesty has attracted considerable attention ( Schantz et al . 1999 ; Verhulst et al . 1999 ; Kotiaho 2001 ; Roberts et al . 2004 ; Emlen et al . 2012 ) . Carotenoid - dependent coloration—predominantly yel - low and orange to red colors present in reptiles , ﬁsh , and mammals and especially common in birds ( McGraw 2006 ) —represents a widespread class of sexual signals . Carotenoid - dependent coloration features in mate choice ( Sundberg 1995 ; Ku¨nzler and Bakker 2001 ; Pike et al . 2007 ; Simons and Verhulst 2011 ; Toomey and McGraw 2012 ) and signals phenotypic quality ; more intense coloration has been linked to reproduction and survival ( Hill 1991 ; Nolan et al . 1998 ; Ho˜rak et al . 2001 ; Pre´ault et al . 2005 ; Pike et al . 2007 ; Simons et al . 2012 a ) , immune function , and oxidative stress state ( meta - analysis in Simons et al . 2012 b ) . Carotenoid molecules are responsible for pig - menting these traits , and consequently plasma carotenoid levels are often positively correlated to the intensity of sexual coloration within species ( Simons et al . 2012 b ) ; supplementation has also been shown to increase color - ation ( Blount et al . 2003 ; Simons et al . 2012 b ) . Carotenoids are exclusively derived from the diet ( Olson and Owens 1998 ) and are generally considered to be a This content downloaded from 129 . 125 . 148 . 244 on July 04 , 2018 07 : 18 : 12 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions ( http : / / www . journals . uchicago . edu / t - and - c ) . 742 The American Naturalist limiting physiological resource given their potential to act as antioxidants and / or immune - supporting agents ( Lo - zano 1994 ; Olson and Owens 1998 ; Schantz et al . 1999 ; Vinkler and Albrecht 2010 ; Svensson and Wong 2011 ) . Building on this assumption , it is thought that allocation of carotenoids away from maintenance toward coloration underlies honesty of carotenoid - dependent signals . This hypothesis posits that individuals advertise their ability to allocate carotenoids away from the physiological processes that carotenoids would inﬂuence positively ( i . e . , the ca - rotenoids’ resource value ) toward signal pigmentation ( “handicap signaling” ) and thereby advertise their genetic and / or phenotypic quality ( Kokko et al . 2006 ) . However , costly acquisition of carotenoids to pigment traits could also maintain honesty ( Olson and Owens 1998 ; Hill and Johnson 2012 ) . Behaviorally , individuals may show plas - ticity in foraging and favor carotenoid - enriched diets , as demonstrated experimentally in great tits ( Parus major ; Senar et al . 2010 ) . Additionally , differences in levels of food intake and / or metabolic uptake and processing of ingested carotenoids can inﬂuence their availability for both ornamentation and physiological functions . Hence , ﬁtness costs of carotenoid - dependent ornaments may arise from the costs of carotenoid uptake , due to time and / or energy invested in carotenoid acquisition , which would also maintain signal honesty . In addition , carotenoids may also prove toxic at high levels or in certain contexts , such as under oxidative stress ( Hartley and Kennedy 2004 ; Si - mons et al . 2014 a ) , which conﬂicts with the notion that allocating carotenoids to integumentary structures nec - essarily trades off with physiological functioning . Finally , signal honesty can also arise from localized metabolic costs for incorporation into colorful integumentary structures ( McGraw 2004 ) . Thus , although the physiological resource value hypothesis for the honesty of carotenoid visual sig - nals has garnered much attention , alternative hypotheses are also likely . The causal relationship between carotenoids , oxidative stress state , and immunocompetence ( as shown in a recent meta - analysis of carotenoid supplementation studies ; Si - mons et al . 2012 b ) may also arise via costly acquisition . When carotenoid availability is increased experimentally , costly acquisition may be down - regulated , allowing the energetic or resource investment into carotenoid acqui - sition to be allocated toward immunocompetence and bat - tling oxidative stress instead . Thus , costs associated with honest signaling of carotenoid - dependent traits may be based either on the value of carotenoids as a physiological resource or on costs related to their acquisition . This dis - tinction has important consequences for our understand - ing of the evolution of carotenoid ornaments , because the mechanisms underlying honesty in both scenarios are dif - ferent . When carotenoids are used as a physiological re - source , allocation of carotenoids away from speciﬁc phys - iological needs and toward coloration will be responsible for maintaining honesty . In contrast , if the acquisition of carotenoids itself is either energetically limiting , behav - iorally limiting , or subject to context - dependent detri - mental effects , constraints on the investment in the ac - quisition of carotenoids itself will underlie honesty . In addition , carotenoid acquisition might not have reached the evolutionary optimum where physiological and or - namental investments of this resource are at an equilib - rium , in which case allocation to ornaments is not costly and trade - offs are not responsible for the maintenance of honesty , and choice for carotenoid - dependent coloration would likely be driven by Fisherian ( “sexy son” ) mecha - nisms ( Kokko et al . 2006 ) . Recent advances in phylogenetic comparative methods make it possible to test such hypotheses in a macroevo - lutionary framework . Trait evolution across evolutionary time can be modeled as Brownian motion ( BM ) and Orn - stein - Uhlenbeck ( OU ) processes ( Butler and King 2004 ) . BM is a random walk model with each time - step deter - mined by a sample from a normal distribution with a standard deviation ( j 2 ) representing the rate of “random drift” ( O’Meara et al . 2006 ) . OU extends BM models by introducing an optimum ( v ) with an attraction parameter ( a ) , representing the strength of attraction toward the op - timum and usually interpreted in terms of selection toward an optimal value or constraints limiting evolution away from it ( Hansen 1997 ) . Recently , these models have been incorporated into a general framework in which these pa - rameters can be allowed to vary across a phylogeny , such as under evolutionary regimes determined by a coevolving phenotypic or ecological trait ( Beaulieu et al . 2012 ) . This framework provides the exciting possibility to test speciﬁc adaptive hypotheses in comparative data . Here we examine the evolution of plasma carotenoid levels in relation to carotenoid - dependent trait evolution in birds . Resource - or pigment - based honesty mechanisms of carotenoid - dependent coloration provide distinctly different predic - tions for the evolutionary model to be favored . Hypothesis 1 When carotenoids are simply strictly limiting color signal elaboration , we expect a BM model with similar rates of change ( j 2 ) between lineages with and without carotenoid - dependent traits to be favored . Although commonly in - terpreted as a “pure drift” model , a BM model may also reﬂect the pattern of lineages evolving toward phyloge - netically structured , lineage - speciﬁc adaptive optima , which are randomly structured in relation to the consid - ered factors ( Revell et al . 2008 ) . In this scenario , the level of carotenoids does not limit the evolution of carotenoid - This content downloaded from 129 . 125 . 148 . 244 on July 04 , 2018 07 : 18 : 12 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions ( http : / / www . journals . uchicago . edu / t - and - c ) . Evolution of Plasma Carotenoid Levels 743 dependent coloration , and within - and among - species ca - rotenoid levels are limited by unknown constraints , which are likely to vary at a ﬁne scale because of ecological factors ( such as dietary carotenoid availability ) . Hypothesis 2 When carotenoids are a limiting resource , we expect a single optimum OU model to be favored . Selection to maintain or increase plasma carotenoid level is indepen - dent of the presence of carotenoid - dependent ornaments , because carotenoids provide physiological resource ben - eﬁts irrespective of the presence of sexual signaling . Thus we expect strong attraction toward this optimum , with possibly higher attraction ( or lower evolutionary rates ) in lineages that exhibit carotenoid - dependent traits , because sexual selection within these linages is predicted to enhance selective pressures , thereby maintaining carotenoid levels closer to the shared optimal value . Hypothesis 3 When carotenoids are not a limiting resource and are mostly used as a pigment , we expect an OU model with two optima—one lower optimum with low attraction ( weak stabilizing selection ) in lineages lacking carotenoid - dependent traits and a higher optimum with stronger at - traction in lineages that do exhibit carotenoid - dependent traits—to be preferred . If carotenoids are not a physio - logical resource , natural selection should not drive the evolution of plasma carotenoid levels to be high in the absence of carotenoid - dependent sexual signals . In con - trast , in lineages with carotenoid - dependent traits , sexual selection is expected to select for higher carotenoid levels ( higher optima ) , which will mostly be used for signal pigmentation . Methods Plasma Carotenoid Levels We searched the literature using Google Scholar for articles reporting plasma carotenoid levels in birds , with the latest search dating to December 2011 . Plasma carotenoid levels in birds are positively related to carotenoid levels in the liver ( Figuerola et al . 2005 ; Møller et al . 2005 ; McGraw et al . 2006 ; Butler and McGraw 2010 ; McGraw and Toomey 2010 ; Galvan et al . 2012 ) , although less consistently so to carotenoids in fat ( Figuerola et al . 2005 ; McGraw and Toomey 2010 ) . The liver and fat are the main storage organs for carotenoids ( Negro et al . 2001 ; Hill and Johnson 2012 ) , and plasma carotenoid levels are therefore a reliable proxy of total carotenoid stores . Our search returned 53 articles containing information on 251 carotenoid plasma level means for 178 different species of birds ( deposited in the Dryad Digital Repos - itory : http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 5061 / dryad . kg007 ; Simons et al . 2014 b ) . When we obtained multiple estimates of plasma carotenoid level per species , we took a weighted average ( for the square root of the sample size ) . Carotenoid levels followed a log - normal distribution and were transformed accordingly ( ) before the analyses . log ( x (cid:2) 1 ) 10 Carotenoid - Dependent Coloration We scored whether the species for which we collected ca - rotenoid plasma level estimates exhibited carotenoid - dependent traits based on previous studies and reports and on photographs when such information was not avail - able ( Simons et al . 2012 b ) . We judged the presence of carotenoid - dependent traits by its characteristic yellow , or - ange , or red color ( Gray 1996 ; Tella et al . 2004 ; Olson and Owens 2005 ; Galvan et al . 2012 ) , excluding those derived from other described pigments ( e . g . , psittacofulvins ; Mc - Graw and Nogare 2004 ) . The scoring was done by two experimenters blind to the collected plasma carotenoid levels . Furthermore , we validated our scoring using two published sets of actual carotenoid content of ornaments ( Fox 1976 ; McGraw 2006 ) . The pictures were obtained using Google image search using the scientiﬁc name of the species as the search query ( Simons et al . 2012 b ) . In ad - dition , we scored whether the coloration was present in plumage or in the integument . Phylogeny We used the complete avian species - level time - calibrated phylogeny by Jetz et al . ( 2012 ) for our comparative anal - yses . This tree was constructed under a Bayesian frame - work using a supermatrix approach based on a previously established higher - order relationship as a “backbone” ( Hackett et al . 2008 ) , considering both phylogenetic and taxonomic information , with the species lacking genetic sequences placed in the tree according to their taxonomic classiﬁcation and a birth - death model ( Jetz et al . 2012 ) . This approach , while representing our best knowledge of the avian tree of life and being mostly congruent with other independent phylogenies constructed using different approaches , can lead to biases resulting from taxonomic imprecision or incorrect model choice when placing them in the phylogeny . However , our data set included only three of 178 species ( Circus pygargus , Chiroxiphia lanceo - lata , and Myiarchus panamensis ) lacking genetic data and thus grafted taxonomically to the tree . Therefore , and given that these species are relatively well resolved taxo - This content downloaded from 129 . 125 . 148 . 244 on July 04 , 2018 07 : 18 : 12 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions ( http : / / www . journals . uchicago . edu / t - and - c ) . 744 The American Naturalist i n t egu m en t p l u m age 0 2 Plasma carotenoidslog 10 ( μ g + 1 ) Figure 1 : Maximum clade credibility tree from Jetz et al .

A randomly drawn sample of 500 phylogenetic trees from the posterior distri - bution transformed to a total root - to - tip distance of 1 was used in all comparative analyses . nomically within their groups , we kept all species in our analyses . Nonetheless , to integrate across competing and uncer - tain scenarios deriving from the phylogenetic reconstruc - tion , we sampled 500 trees from the posterior distribution and obtained a representation of topologies and relative branch lengths proportional to their posterior probabili - ties , which were transformed to a total root - to - tip distance of 1 and used in the comparative analyses described below . Evolutionary Models To test for the effects of the presence or absence of ca - rotenoid - dependent traits ( present in plumage , integu - ment , or the combined measure ) , we used phylogenetically controlled generalized least squares ( PGLS ) models ( Gra - fen 1989 ) . Plasma carotenoid level was included as the response variable , and the presence or absence of integ - ument and plumage carotenoid traits , as well as their in - teraction , were included as predictor variables . We con - ducted PGLS analyses considering an OU model of trait evolution ( Martins and Hansen 1997 ) , with parameter es - timates for the predictor variables and the OU a estimated under maximum likelihood using the R packages APE ( Pardis et al . 2004 ) and nlme ( Pinheiro et al . 2013 ) . Max - imum likelihood estimates of the parameters were ob - tained across all trees , and the sum of the among - tree and mean within - tree variance was used to statistically test for the effects of the response variables while accounting for phylogenetic and estimate uncertainties . To estimate the evolutionary regimes determined by the presence or absence of carotenoid - dependent traits , we used stochastic character mapping ( Huelsenbeck et al . 2003 ) to reconstruct the evolution of carotenoid signals . This method produces stochastic regime mappings of tran - sitions between states ( carotenoid ornaments present or absent ) following a continuous - time Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) model . We applied a hierarchical Bayesian approach to incorporate uncertainty from both phyloge - netic and regime reconstruction . To choose adequate pri - ors for the regime reconstruction , we conducted an MCMC analysis to sample overall rate values , using the posterior distribution of these rates to obtain the a and b parameters for the best - ﬁtting gamma distribution . The estimated parameters were then used to determine the gamma distribution used as the prior for the stochastic character mapping of the presence of plumage traits ( a p 10 , b p 7 ) , integument traits ( a p 8 . 3 , b p 11 ) , or any carotenoid trait ( a p 11 . 5 , b p 22 . 5 ) , and a uniform prior for both states at the root . For each of the 500 sam - pled trees from the posterior distribution , we ran the sto - chastic character mapping reconstruction for 1 , 000 gen - erations after a burn - in of equal length , sampling every This content downloaded from 129 . 125 . 148 . 244 on July 04 , 2018 07 : 18 : 12 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions ( http : / / www . journals . uchicago . edu / t - and - c ) .

Therefore , a total of 5 , 000 trees representing combi - nations of phylogenetic and ancestral state reconstructions were used to ﬁt the evolutionary models . We used this approach to reconstruct evolutionary regimes determined by the presence of any carotenoid trait ( integument and / or plumage ) and by the presence of plumage traits and integument traits separately . For each regime set of re - constructions , we ﬁtted seven different evolutionary mod - els under a generalized Hansen model framework , encom - passing derivations from BM and OU ( Butler and King 2004 ; Beaulieu et al . 2012 ; Lapiedra et al . 2013 ) , using the package OUwie ( Beaulieu et al . 2012 ) in R ( R Development Core Team 2008 ) . BM models considered included a model with a single ( carotenoid trait - independent ) evolutionary rate ( j 2 ) across the tree ( BM1 ) and a model with separate rates of plasma - level carotenoid evolution for each regime ( lineages with and without carotenoid - dependent traits ; BMS ) . We also considered ﬁve different OU models . The ﬁrst included a single , trait - independent optimum ( v ) for plasma carotenoid levels ( OU1 ) , whereas a second con - sidered carotenoid trait - dependent optima , with two op - tima for the different regimes ( OUM ) . Both of these mod - els still estimated the same attraction parameter ( a ) and rate of random drift ( j 2 ) across lineages with and without carotenoid traits . The third model allowed both optima and attraction parameter a to vary according to the evo - lutionary regime while ﬁtting the same rate of evolution j 2 ( OUMA ) , whereas the fourth allowed the rate of evo - lution to vary between the two optima with a shared at - traction parameter across regimes ( OUMV ) . Finally , a model in which all parameters—optima , rates , and attraction—were allowed to vary across the regimes ( OUMVA ) was considered . Models were estimated con - sidering the estimated intraspeciﬁc means . Model choice was conducted using relative likelihoods based on the sec - ond - order corrected Akaike Information Criterion ( AICc ) , which allows for the comparison of nested and nonnested models ( Butler and King 2004 ) , and model - averaged pa - rameters weighted for their relative support across the dif - ferent models were calculated ( Lapiedra et al . 2013 ) .

Thus , circulating carotenoid levels are only affected by the presence of carotenoid - colored plumage traits , independent of the presence of other in - tegumentary carotenoid - colored traits , and can vary con - siderably between closely related species ( ﬁgs . 1 , 2 ) . Overall , OU models with differential optima of plasma carotenoid levels for lineages lacking and exhibiting carotenoid - dependent traits were preferred over models that did not consider carotenoid - dependent trait regimes and over models that considered only rate variation be - tween lineages with and without carotenoid traits ( table 1 ) . However , plumage - only regimes were strongly sup - ported over “any carotenoid trait” models , which in turn outperformed “integument only” models ( table 1 ) . To - gether , these results suggest that the adaptive evolution of circulating carotenoid levels is inﬂuenced by evolutionary regimes determined solely by either the presence or ab - sence of plumage carotenoid ornaments . Given the strong preference for OU over BM models and for plumage over other trait regimes , we based our inferences on model - averaged parameters across OU mod - els in the plumage - determined regimes ( Lapiedra et al . 2013 ) . The four OUM models , characterized by different optima and attraction and rate parameters across the re - gimes determined by the presence of carotenoid - based plumage traits , together received the strongest support , being the preferred set of models in more than 99 % of cases ( table 1 ) . However , there was some uncertainty be - tween the four models that incorporated different optima , with the simplest model of different optima with the same rates and attraction parameters ( OUM ) receiving most of the support ( table 1 ) . The model - averaged parameter es - timates strongly supported a higher optimum plasma ca - rotenoid level for lineages exhibiting carotenoid - depen - dent plumage relative to those lacking such traits ( ﬁgs . 3 , 4 ) . Lineages without carotenoid plumage tended to have lower evolutionary rates ( j 2 ) and attraction parameters ( a ) than lineages with carotenoid traits , but these differences were very small and not statistically signiﬁcant ( ﬁgs . 3 , 4 ) . Discussion Our results support the hypothesis that circulating carot - enoid levels show adaptive evolution toward higher values associated with the presence of carotenoid - dependent plumage coloration . They are therefore in line with hy - pothesis 3 , that carotenoid plumage reﬂects the ability to acquire these pigments rather than the allocation of a lim - ited resource into signaling .

The vertical dotted line indicates no difference in parameters ( at zero ) . Optima of carotenoid levels are higher for lineages that exhibit carotenoid - dependent plumage ( the tail - area probability of relative to zero ! . 001 ) , but no v (cid:3) v present absent differences were observed between the attractions toward the optima ( a ) and rates ( j 2 ) . rotenoid levels is higher in lineages exhibiting carotenoid - dependent plumage traits , yet the attraction toward both optima is similar and high . The selection to maintain ca - rotenoid levels in lineages that do not exhibit carotenoid - dependent plumage may be interpreted as reﬂecting the physiological resource value of carotenoids ( hypothesis 2 ) . However , increased acquisition of carotenoids is rapidly selected in the presence of carotenoid - dependent plumage , most likely via sexual selection . This suggests that trade - offs maintaining honesty of carotenoid - dependent signals must also consider the physiology associated with carot - enoid acquisition ( hypothesis 3 ) . It is surprising that higher plasma carotenoid levels are selected for only in species that exhibit carotenoid - depen - dent plumage but not integumentary coloration . Plumage pigmentation is mostly static , and carotenoids are only incorporated into feathers at set times , which are deter - mined by molting patterns ( Blount and McGraw 2007 ) . Thus , reduced circulating carotenoid levels and / or selec - tion on maintaining them might be expected , especially because most blood samples were taken outside the period of new feather formation . Elaborate plumage coloration may require larger carotenoid levels to assure carotenoid availability during a relatively short period ( molt ) , when large amounts of carotenoids are incorporated . Further - more , there is no evidence that the associations between signal expression and immunocompetence and oxidative stress state are weaker when carotenoid - dependent traits are expressed in plumage compared with integument ( Si - mons et al . 2012 b ) , which would be expected under hy - pothesis 2 , given the differences in plasma carotenoid levels observed . This further supports the hypothesis that ca - rotenoid signals , particularly plumage signals , can also re - ﬂect the ability to acquire carotenoids rather than the handicap of allocating scarce carotenoids toward pigmen - tation . In the case of integumentary coloration , another possible explanation for its weak relationship with plasma carotenoid levels could be that the continuous turnover and investment of carotenoids in bare skin traits reduces carotenoid levels in circulation . As a consequence , total carotenoids acquired could be higher for species with bare skin carotenoid traits , but the dynamic nature of allocation of pigments to such traits decouples ornamentation from circulating levels . Measuring actual carotenoid acquisition , turnover , and incorporation in sexual signals ( e . g . , using carotenoids labeled with stable isotopes ; Canene - Adams and Erdman 2009 ) in species that express integument ver - sus plumage coloration as well as investigating circulating levels continuously ( before , during , and after molt ) is thus critical to understand this pattern . In the preferred evolutionary models , the attraction rate ( a ) for plasma carotenoid levels was considerably high , indicating that levels rapidly evolve toward their respective This content downloaded from 129 . 125 . 148 . 244 on July 04 , 2018 07 : 18 : 12 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions ( http : / / www . journals . uchicago . edu / t - and - c ) . 748 The American Naturalist 1 10 Absent Present R a t e o f p l a s m a e v o l u t i on ( σ 2 ) 1 10 100 Absent Present S t r eng t h o f s e l e c t i on ( α ) 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 1 . 4 Absent Present Carotenoid−dependent coloration P l a s m a c a r o t eno i d l e v e l ( l og 10 ( μ g + 1 ) ) op t i m u m ( θ ) c a r o t eno i d Figure 4 : Boxplots of the model - averaged parameters ( j 2 , a , and v ) for the evolution of circulating carotenoid levels in relation to se - lective regimes determined by the presence ( dark gray ) or absence ( light gray ) of carotenoid - dependent plumage coloration across the posterior sample of the 5 , 000 phylogenetic trees used . optima regardless of past evolutionary history and phy - logenetic effects . Such fast evolution of plasma carotenoid levels has been demonstrated earlier in two sympatric morphs of sockeye salmon ( Oncorhynchus nerka ) . Anad - romous morphs experience relatively high carotenoid availability at sea and have genetically determined lower rates of carotenoid acquisition , whereas nonanadromous morphs experience lower carotenoid availability in fresh - water and have genetically determined higher rates of ac - quisition ( Craig and Foote 2001 ; Craig et al . 2005 ) . Indeed , carotenoid uptake is an active process that may not always be maximized ( Hill and Johnson 2012 ) , contrary to the expectation if carotenoids are scarce and have high phys - iological value . Rapid evolution of carotenoid acquisition may also explain why diet has marginal effects on plasma carotenoid levels and the evolution of carotenoid - depen - dent traits , as demonstrated by earlier comparative work ( Tella et al . 2004 ; Olson and Owens 2005 ; Galvan et al . 2012 ) . These studies demonstrated that carotenoid - dependent coloration is associated with higher circulating carotenoid levels ( Tella et al . 2004 ) but not liver levels ( Galvan et al . 2012 ) . Our results expand on these ﬁndings by showing that optima of plasma carotenoids are higher in species with carotenoid - dependent plumage but that attraction toward this optimum is similar in lineages lack - ing and exhibiting carotenoid - dependent traits . At a microevolutionary level , there are four possible mechanistic scenarios underlying variation in carotenoid - dependent coloration : ( 1 ) differences in carotenoid ac - quisition , which is still evolving toward the optimum , may underlie variation in color intensity ; or if carotenoid ac - quisition is near or at the optimum , the carotenoid - dependent trait may honestly signal quality based on either ( 2 ) the costs of acquisition or ( 3 ) the resource value of carotenoids . Finally , ( 4 ) the carotenoid - dependent trait may not be used in mate choice anymore , with its current presence reﬂecting historical ( phylogenetic ) patterns of sexual selection , maintained for reasons such as species or sex recognition ( Holland and Rice 1998 ) . Mating preference for carotenoid - dependent signal in - tensity would be a reason to reject scenario 4 , but mate choice studies for carotenoid - dependent traits are rela - tively rare ( Simons and Verhulst 2011 ) . Scenarios 1 and 2 can be distinguished from 3 by studying whether variation in carotenoid acquisition underlies color intensity varia - tion . If there is little variation in carotenoid acquisition , then by default scenario 3 becomes more likely ( i . e . , that the resource value of carotenoids governs intraspeciﬁc var - iation in ornamental color , given that carotenoids are only predicted to be allocated away from crucial physiological needs when there is little scope for increasing carotenoid acquisition ) . Our results challenge scenario 3 at the mac - roevolutionary level , showing an association between plasma carotenoid levels and the presence of carotenoid deposition . The rapid response of carotenoid levels to sex - ual selection supports the hypothesis that pure acquisition and assimilation of carotenoids ( scenarios 1 and 2 ) may This content downloaded from 129 . 125 . 148 . 244 on July 04 , 2018 07 : 18 : 12 AM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions ( http : / / www . journals . uchicago . edu / t - and - c ) . Evolution of Plasma Carotenoid Levels 749 be key in carotenoid signaling . This hypothesis can also explain interspeciﬁc differences in the relationship between carotenoid levels and carotenoid - dependent signals with quality indices , as reported elsewhere for oxidative stress state and immunocompetence ( Simons et al . 2012 b ) . Moreover , carotenoid - dependent signals are predicted to be correlated with reproductive success under scenarios 1 , 2 , and 3 but not with indices of quality under scenario 1 , which only bears indirect ( “sexy son” ) beneﬁts . Our macroevolutionary results posit exciting perspec - tives as to whether acquisition - based or resource - based honesty is the main driver of the honesty and evolution of carotenoid - based ornaments . For example , what are the ecological and physiological characters favoring evolution of either mechanism ? The generality of both mechanisms and whether pure acquisition - based or resource - based honesty can be shown to operate will be crucial to un - derstand the evolution of carotenoid ornaments . The com - parative evidence presented here questions the dominant hypothesis that honest signaling of carotenoid - dependent traits is exclusively based on the resource value of carot - enoids . Our results suggest instead that , at least in the interspeciﬁc level , there is a role for carotenoid acquisition and , more importantly , for the constraints that operate in shaping carotenoid acquisition .
