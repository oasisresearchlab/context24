The cytoskeleton consists of microtubules , intermediate ﬁla - ments , and actin ﬁlaments . Coﬁlin , an actin - depolymerizing protein , is indispensable for regulating actin dynamics in the central nervous system ( CNS ) development and function . Coﬁlin activities are spatiotemporally orchestrated by numerous extra - and intra - cellular factors . Phosphorylation at Ser - 3 by kinases attenuate coﬁlin’s actin - binding activity . In contrast , dephosphorylation at Ser - 3 enhances coﬁlin - induced actin depolymerization . Coﬁlin functions are also modulated by various binding partners or reactive oxygen species . Although the mechanism of coﬁlin - mediated actin dynamics has been known for decades , recent research works are unveiling the profound impacts of coﬁlin dysregulation in neurodegenerative pathophysiology . For instance , oxidative stress - induced increase in coﬁlin dephosphorylation is linked to the accumulation of tau tangles and amyloid - beta plaques in Alzheimer’s disease . In Parkinson’s disease , coﬁlin activation by silencing its upstream kinases increases α - synuclein - ﬁbril entry into the cell . This review describes the molecular mechanism of coﬁlin - mediated actin dynamics and provides an overview of coﬁlin’s importance in CNS physiology and pathophysiology .

Introduction Neurons contain a cytoskeleton consisting of microtubules , neuroﬁlaments , and actin ﬁlaments . Microtubules are composed of tubulin proteins and other polypeptides and provide the essential organization of organelles . Neuroﬁlaments , which are class IV inter - mediate ﬁlaments , offer structural support to axons and inﬂuence nerve conduction velocity . Actin ﬁlaments ( F - actin ) are composed of globular actin monomers ( G - actin ) . Dynamic transition can occur between G - actin and F - actin , and the polymerization - depolymerization events are spatiotemporally regulated in response to numerous extracellular and intracel - lular stimuli . Actin is an ATPase , and both G - actin and F - actin can bind to ATP . When ATP - bound G - actin monomers assemble into a polymer , ATP hydrolyzes rapidly to gener - ate ADP - Pi actin , slowly releasing the inorganic phosphate producing ADP - actin subunits . Consequently , actin ﬁlaments exhibit considerable asymmetry with a plus end ( barbed end or growing end ) and a minus end ( pointed end or shrinking end ) dominated by ATP - and ADP - actins , respectively . ATP - G - actin monomers are preferentially polymer - ized to the barbed end whereas , ADP - actin subunits are depolymerized from the pointed end . The actin dynamics is precisely controlled by various actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) such as actin - related protein 2 / 3 complex ( Arp2 / 3 ) , cortactin , formin , proﬁlin , and actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / coﬁlin ( reviewed in [ 1 ] ) . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10727 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / ijms221910727 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / ijms Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10727 2 of 18 Three ADF / coﬁlin family members are expressed in mammals : ADF , coﬁlin - 1 , and coﬁlin - 2 ( reviewed in [ 2 , 3 ] ) . The ﬁrst member ADF ( also known as destrin ) , encoded by the gene DSTN in humans , was initially identiﬁed in the chick brain [ 4 ] . Coﬁlin was discovered as an actin - interacting protein in the porcine brain [ 5 , 6 ] . Later , Ono et al . identiﬁed two mammalian variants of coﬁlin , non - muscle type ( also known as coﬁlin - 1 and n - coﬁlin ) and muscle type ( also known as coﬁlin - 2 and m - coﬁlin ) [ 7 ] . In humans , coﬁlin - 1 and coﬁlin - 2 are encoded by the genes CFL1 and CFL2 , respectively . Different isoforms of ADF / coﬁlin have qualitatively similar but quantitatively different effects on actin dynamics [ 8 ] . To be noted , both ADF and coﬁlin show cooperative binding with actin ﬁlaments [ 9 , 10 ] . Interestingly , coﬁlin - 1 comprises almost 90 % of the total ADF / coﬁlin family in CNS [ 11 ] . For simplicity , we will use the term ‘coﬁlin’ to mention coﬁlin - 1 hereafter . Coﬁlin can bind to both G - actin and F - actin , exhibiting stronger afﬁnities for the ADP - bound actins than the ATP - or ADP - Pi - bound forms [ 12 ] . Coﬁlin binding to F - actin induces actin subunit rotation , enhances Pi release along the ﬁlament , and promotes ﬁlament severing in a concentration - dependent manner [ 8 , 13 , 14 ] ( Figure 1 ) . Severing is rapid at a low coﬁlin / actin ratio and suppressed at a high coﬁlin / actin ratio . Interestingly , only a few coﬁlin molecules can induce actin ﬁlament fragmentation , predominantly at the pointed end of the coﬁlin domain [ 15 , 16 ] . Severing generates newer ends of the ﬁlament where coﬁlin may accelerate the disassembly of ADP - actins from the pointed end [ 16 ] . On the contrary , higher coﬁlin concentrations can favor actin polymerization through nucleation [ 13 ] . Thus , coﬁlin is capable of controlling actin dynamics through both polymerization and depolymerization . Conceivably , regulation of coﬁlin activity is immensely complex where diverse stimuli in the cell microenvironment orchestrate the cytoskeleton dynamics in physiological and pathophysiological conditions [ 17 , 18 ] . For instance , two guidance cues , nerve growth factor ( NGF ) and netrin - 1 , were found to activate coﬁlin , increase free actin barbed ends , and promote growth cone protrusion [ 19 ] . Meyer et al . ( 2005 ) showed that insulin - like growth factor I ( IGF - I ) enhances neuroblastoma cell motility through activation of coﬁlin and its upstream regulators [ 20 ] . Tilve and colleagues ( 2015 ) observed an extracellular synuclein - induced coﬁlin inactivation and dysregulation of neuronal actin dynamics [ 21 ] . At the molecular level , coﬁlin activity is modulated by phosphorylation - dephosphorylation , binding to other regulatory proteins , and redox modiﬁcations . We have discussed essential coﬁlin regulators in the next section . For further details , interested readers are referred to many outstanding reviews describing the roles and regulations of coﬁlin in actin dynam - ics [ 22 – 27 ] . Int . J . Mol .

At low cofilin / actin ratios , cofilin severs F - actin and increases the ADP - actin monomer dissociation rate . Actin polymerization is favored in the presence of nucleotide ex - change regulators ( e . g . , profilin , CAP ) . At high cofilin / actin ratios , cofilin stabilizes F - actin where all the sub - units have undergone cofilin - induced rotation . Cofilin can also induce nucleation . Inactive p - cofilin does not significantly bind to F - actin , and actin severing or depolymerization is low . Conceivably , regulation of cofilin activity is immensely complex where diverse stim - uli in the cell microenvironment orchestrate the cytoskeleton dynamics in physiological and pathophysiological conditions [ 17 , 18 ] . For instance , two guidance cues , nerve growth factor ( NGF ) and netrin - 1 , were found to activate cofilin , increase free actin barbed ends , and promote growth cone protrusion [ 19 ] .

At the molecular level , cofilin activity is modulated by phosphorylation - dephosphoryla - tion , binding to other regulatory proteins , and redox modifications . We have discussed Figure 1 .

Actin polymerization is favored in the presence of nucleotide exchange regulators ( e . g . , proﬁlin , CAP ) . At high coﬁlin / actin ratios , coﬁlin stabilizes F - actin where all the subunits have undergone coﬁlin - induced rotation . Coﬁlin can also induce nucleation . Inactive p - coﬁlin does not signiﬁcantly bind to F - actin , and actin severing or depolymerization is low . 2 . Signaling Mechanisms for Coﬁlin Activation and Inactivation The Ser - 3 residue in coﬁlin is a conserved phosphorylation site [ 28 , 29 ] . Coﬁlin is activated via dephosphorylation at Ser - 3 by slingshot family proteins ( SSHs ; SSH1 , SSH2 , and SSH3 ) through the Ca 2 + / calmodulin - dependent calcineurin activation pathway [ 30 , 31 ] . On the other hand , coﬁlin is deactivated via phosphorylation at Ser - 3 by LIM domain kinases ( LIMKs ) and dual - speciﬁcity testis - speciﬁc protein kinases ( TESKs ) [ 32 , 33 ] . Major proteins modulating coﬁlin activity are listed in Table 1 , and critical signaling mechanisms are summarized in Figure 2 . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10727 4 of 18 Table 1 .

The N - terminal domain of SSH1 interacts with coﬁlin , where the Cys - 393 residue of SSH1 is critical in removing the phosphate group from coﬁlin Ser - 3 [ 51 , 52 ] . SSH1 can also dephosphorylate LIMK1 and attenuate LIMK1 (cid:48) s enzymatic activity towards coﬁlin [ 53 ] . Singla et al . ( 2019 ) showed that growth factor induction in macrophages can activate coﬁlin and regulate actin dynamics through an SSH1 - dependent pathway [ 54 ] . In addition , SSH1 has independent F - actin - stabilizing and bundling activities and promotes the disassembly of F - actin [ 34 ] . Coronins are F - actin - binding proteins , which also interact with microtubules and modulate cell motility and actin dynamics . SSH1 can dephosphorylate Coronins . In - versely , coronins may dephosphorylate SSH1 and induce coﬁlin activation at the leading edge [ 35 , 36 ] . Coronin - 1B directs SSH1 towards lamellipodia and thereby regulates the activity of coﬁlin via dephosphorylation [ 35 ] . Coronin - 2A binds and colocalizes with SSH1 at focal adhesions [ 36 ] . Depletion of coronin - 1B inhibits SSH1 - induced lamellipodial dynamics and coﬁlin activation , while coronin - 2A depletion increases the p - coﬁlin level and diminishes cell migration and focal adhesion . Coronin - 2A depletion can be rescued by expressing active coﬁlin in cell - free assays and cultured cells [ 36 ] . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10727 5 of 18 Int . J . Mol .

These phosphatases and kinases can be activated or inhibited by diverse upstream regulators . Coﬁlin activity is enhanced through binding with CAP2 dimers ( upper left ) , while binding with SPIN90 or cortactin decreases coﬁlin activity ( upper right ) . LIM - kinases are actin - binding proteins , which phosphorylate coﬁlin speciﬁcally at Ser - 3 , attenuating the actin - binding , severing , and depolymerizing activities of coﬁlin [ 32 , 33 ] , reviewed in [ 24 ] . LIMK1 inactivates coﬁlin under control of ras - related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 ( Rac1 ) , while LIMK2 phosphorylates coﬁlin in response to Rho and Cell Division Cycle 42 ( Cdc42 ) rather than Rac1 [ 42 , 55 ] . Downregulation of LIMK1 suppresses the lamellipodium formation induced by Rac1 or insulin . Therefore , both LIMK1 and LIMK2 phosphorylate coﬁlin through the Rac1 / PAK and Rho / Cdc42 pathways , respectively . TESKs are structurally related to LIM - kinases with a kinase domain and a unique C - terminal proline - rich domain . TESK1 can phosphorylate coﬁlin at Ser - 3 in vitro and in vivo to affect actin organization [ 44 ] . When active coﬁlin was expressed in HeLa cells , rhodamine - phalloidin ( a conjugate dye used to stabilize actin ﬁlaments in vitro ) staining was markedly decreased by coﬁlin - mediated actin depolymerization , and this phenomenon was reversed by co - expression of TESK1 with coﬁlin [ 56 ] . Using TESK1 knockout mice , Wang et al . ( 2018 ) showed that TESK1 kinase activity is critical in coﬁlin - induced actin depolymerization [ 57 ] . TESK2 was also found to mediate coﬁlin phosphorylation and the formation of actin stress ﬁbers in cultured cells [ 45 ] . CAPs are multi - domain actin - binding proteins having the capability of actin dynamics regulation at multiple levels [ 58 ] . CAPs and coﬁlin synergize to enhance depolymerization Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10727 6 of 18 of F - actin at the pointed end [ 50 ] . CAPs compete with coﬁlin to bind with G - actin and promote its nucleotide exchange . Though two homologs of CAPs , CAP1 and CAP2 , have been described in mammals , in humans , CAP2 plays a crucial role in neuronal cells , most notably in spine morphology [ 59 ] . CAP2 dimers / oligomers promote depolymerization of coﬁlin - saturated fragments of F - actin [ 50 , 58 ] . Alterations in dendritic architecture and spine morphology have been reported in CAP2 knockout neurons [ 60 ] . A recent study reported CAP2 as a postsynaptic protein relevant to regulating synaptic transmission and plasticity by shaping dendritic and spine morphology , which are all interconnected to actin depolymerization through coﬁlin activity [ 60 ] . In addition to phosphorylation - dephosphorylation , coﬁlin activity is also altered by several other mechanisms , including redox regulation . ROS can directly modulate coﬁlin in two different ways . First , direct oxidation of coﬁlin at Cys - 139 / 147 to sulfenic acid in response to hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) impairs coﬁlin binding to actin [ 61 ] . Second , under mild oxidative stress , ROS induces coﬁlin activation and an intermolecular disulﬁde bond between Cys - 147 and Cys - 39 , forming coﬁlin - actin oligomers [ 62 , 63 ] and may lead to rod formation under an oxidative environment . Nonetheless , ROS can modulate coﬁlin by oxidation and inhibiting its actin - severing action . 3 . Coﬁlin Functions in the CNS Development 3 . 1 . Neural Tube Morphogenesis Neurulation in human embryos proceeds in two phases , primary and secondary . The neural tube , the embryonic precursor of the CNS , is developed from the neural plate ( a section of the ectoderm ) via primary neurulation [ 64 ] involving four overlapping stages : neural induction , shaping , bending of the neural plate , and neural tube closure [ 65 ] . Neural crest cells are generated from the neural tube during neurulation and take long migration routes before settling and differentiating into distinct cell types . Gurniak et al . ( 2005 ) showed that the coﬁlin - mutant mouse embryos fail to form the neural tube and exhibit substantial aberration migration of neural crest cells [ 66 ] . Coﬁlin mutation results in malfor - mation of actin structure and loss of polarity of the neural crest cells , which severely affects neuronal development in mice [ 66 ] . Coﬁlin is indispensable for actin depolymerization and actomyosin organization in the neural epithelium , which are critical for neural tube formation [ 67 , 68 ] . A lack of secretory pathway calcium ATPase ( SPCA1 ) in mouse embryos shares similar neural tube deformation with coﬁlin mutants [ 69 ] . Interestingly , SPCA1 was found to direct coﬁlin colocalization with apical actin ﬁlaments in the neuroepithe - lium . Thus , coﬁlin appears as an essential protein for proper neural tube closure during embryonic development . 3 . 2 . Neurite Formation The formation of neurites , the immature projections arising from the neuronal cell body , is a unique and signiﬁcant step in neurogenesis . The brain’s development and function largely depend on neurite formation , which requires many growth signals , recep - tor stimuli , and a complex interplay among intracellular and extracellular signals . Actin can function as a microtubule entry barrier in dendritic spines and guide microtubules growing into ﬁlopodia [ 70 ] . Penetration of microtubules is determined by an adequate balance between forward polymerization and backward transport by the retrograde ﬂow of lamellipodium actin [ 71 ] . Three steps are involved in axon elongation : protrusion , en - gorgement , and consolidation . In protrusion , F - actin’s polymerization triggers elongation of lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia , whereas F - actin depolymerization guides polymerized mi - crotubules to elongate into the peripheral domain . In the consolidation step , the transition of microtubules from polymerization to stabilization enables the formation of the neurite shaft . Repeated cycles of these three steps lead to axon elongation . Again , the growth cone’s lamellipodial extension and ﬁlopodial retraction are necessary for all three axon elongation stages [ 71 ] . Coﬁlin is highly concentrated in dendritic spines and growth cones of neurons [ 72 ] . It controls the number and length of ﬁlopodia in response to brain - derived Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10727 7 of 18 neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) [ 73 ] . At the rear of actin meshwork in the growth cone , coﬁlin promotes actin monomers’ recycling to the leading edge for assembly . Coﬁlin thereby enhances membrane protrusion by altering interactions of F - actin with microtubules [ 74 ] . Coﬁlin also facilitates bundling and penetration of microtubules into the growth cone and restricts microtubule entry into dendritic spines . Furthermore , several proteins such as neuronal Nogo - A , semaphorin 3A , and BDNF have been found to regulate the growth cone through coﬁlin [ 74 , 75 ] . Overexpression of coﬁlin or its phosphorylation - resistant mutant coﬁlin S3A ( active coﬁlin mutant ) can stimulate more growth cone - like waves , which produce signiﬁcantly longer axons . In contrast , the inactivation of coﬁlin by LIMK1 overexpression disrupts the fan - like structure of the growth cone , perturbing axon elongation and growth cone motility [ 76 , 77 ] . Such defects can be recovered by overexpressing S3A or slingshot homolog ( SSH ) , a protein phosphatase [ 51 ] . Enhancement of actin ﬁlament turnover in vivo is critically regulated by coﬁlin during neurite formation . Coﬁlin knockout mice exhibit severe abnormalities in multiple brain regions resulting from a profound retrograde ﬂow reduction [ 76 ] . 3 . 3 . Synaptic Plasticity Long - term potentiation ( LTP ) and long - term depression ( LTD ) render durable synaptic plasticity essential for learning and memory . For long - term plasticity , actin - dependent cytoskeletal changes are pivotal in mediating qualitative and quantitative alterations of dendritic spines and synapses ( reviewed in [ 78 ] ) . LTP induction in dendritic spines accompanies spine enlargement and translocation of coﬁlin to spines [ 79 ] . In the LTP , dendritic spine upregulation depends on coﬁlin phos - phorylation , while spine downregulation in the LTD relies on Ca 2 + - dependent calcineurin - induced coﬁlin dephosphorylation [ 80 ] . Coﬁlin is co - localized with CAP2 dimers in the postsynaptic spine , which are required for actin turnover regulation [ 60 ] . Functional loss of coﬁlin causes aberrant spine enlargement , while overaction of coﬁlin increases actin de - polymerization , leading to spine shrinkage or immature spine formation [ 81 – 83 ] . Synaptic relocation of AMPA receptors ( AMPARs ) is crucial for both LTP and LTD [ 84 ] . Coﬁlin has been found to mediate actin dynamics in postsynaptic trafﬁcking of AMPARs following LTP induction [ 81 ] . Moreover , the mobility of AMPARs requires coﬁlin activity during memory extinction , where phosphorylation of coﬁlin causes impairment in memory ex - tinction [ 85 ] . Therefore , optimum coﬁlin activity is essential to mediate structural and functional changes in synaptic plasticity . 3 . 4 . Axon Regeneration Axonal distortion following external or internal injury or inﬂammation in the CNS ensues neurodegeneration . Ironically , a failed regeneration of injured axons in the adult CNS is contrasted with the vigorous axonal growth during embryonic development . Re - generation failure is associated with extracellular inhibitory factors and downregulation of neuron - intrinsic regenerative programs ( reviewed in [ 86 , 87 ] ) . Unlike the developing neurons , injured CNS neurons do not display growth cones following axon injury [ 88 ] ; instead , dystrophic bulbs called ‘retraction bulbs’ are generated ( Figure 3 ) . Stern et al . ( 2013 ) studied regeneration events in a mouse nerve injury model where facial axotomy induced nuclear localization of coﬁlin [ 89 ] . Interestingly , activating injured neurons with serum response factor ( SRF ) enhanced neurite formation and growth cone structures with concomitant depletion of coﬁlin’s nuclear translocation . Citron kinase ( citron - K ) is an inhibitor of neuronal regeneration [ 90 ] . Knockdown of citron - K increased coﬁlin levels in rat dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) cultures treated with CNS myelin extract and ﬁbroblast growth factor - 2 ( FGF2 ) . It attenuated neurite outgrowth inhibition of DRG neurons [ 90 ] . Tedeschi et al . ( 2019 ) showed that nerve conditioning lesions in rodents induce rapid actin turnover and growth cone regeneration in both the PNS and CNS [ 91 ] . Conditioning enhanced SSH1 activity and reduced p - coﬁlin levels , which accompanied a signiﬁcant increase in the number of growth cone protrusions and ﬁlopodia . Intriguingly , Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10727 8 of 18 conditioning - induced axon regeneration was dependent on the actin severing activity , but not on the depolymerization activity of coﬁlin [ 91 ] . In addition , both actin reorganization and axon regeneration were seen to be abolished in coﬁlin - deﬁcient neurons after spinal cord injury [ 91 ] . Therefore , accumulating evidence positions coﬁlin as a potential molecular target for CNS axon regeneration . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 19 Figure 3 .

Cofilin Dysregulation and Neurodegenerative and Psychiatric Disorders Since cofilin is an essential regulator of cytoskeletal and neuronal functions , disrup - tion of its structure and function has profound implications in several neurological disor - ders ( Figure 4 ) . Cofilin dysregulation in rodent models exhibited many neurological symptoms , including cognitive impairment , memory dysfunction , and sleep deprivation [ 92 ] . On the other hand , excess phosphorylation of cofilin can induce dendrite reduction and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) and schizophrenia [ 93 ] . Figure 3 .

Alzheimer’s Disease ( AD ) AD is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that starts slowly and worsens gradu - ally over time . The most common symptoms are associated with signs of dementia and behavioral disorders . Both familial and sporadic AD types can be induced by diverse factors such as aging , oxidative stress , neuroinﬂammation , and synaptic disruption [ 94 , 95 ] . The two most common pathophysiologic hallmarks of AD are ( 1 ) deposition of extracel - lular beta - amyloid ( A β ) ( in senile plaques ) and ( 2 ) phospho - tau containing intracellular neuroﬁbrillary tangles “tau tangles” ( paired helical ﬁlaments ) ( reviewed in [ 96 , 97 ] ) . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10727 10 of 18 An appearance of amyloid - beta ( A β ) - and tau - dependent spine loss is a pathologic feature that directly correlates with cognitive declines in AD [ 98 ] . Coﬁlin was found to aggregate with A β oligomers in human AD brain tissues and mouse AD models [ 11 , 99 ] . A β interacts with many synaptic proteins such as NMDA receptors , PrP C ( prion protein ) , ephrin type B - 2 receptor ( EphB2 ) , metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 ( mGluR5 ) , and β - integrin [ 100 ] . Woo et al . ( 2015 ) showed , using both cultured neurons and in vivo mouse models , that the ran - binding protein 9 ( RanBP9 ) can mediate the accumulation of coﬁlin - actin rods [ 101 ] . RanBP9 enhanced the PrP C - dependent A β - β 1 - integrin signal and coﬁlin dephosphorylation by SSHs . The RanBP9 - SSH1 - coﬁlin axis promoted coﬁlin translocation in the mitochondria and induced a coﬁlin - actin pathology leading to synaptic and mitochondrial dysfunction [ 101 , 102 ] . Decreased coﬁlin expression by downregulation of RanBP9 resulted in protection from memory and learning defects in a mouse model of contextual fear conditioning , signifying roles of coﬁlin activity levels in hippocampal learning and memory [ 101 ] . Coﬁlin activation in cultured neurons induced coﬁlin - rod formation , transform - ing phosphorylated microtubule - associated protein tau ( MAPT ) into cytoskeletal inclu - sions [ 103 ] . In Tau - P301S mice , active coﬁlin was found to promote tauopathy by speciﬁc inhibition of the tau - microtubule interaction through direct competition with tau [ 104 , 105 ] . Moreover , synaptic dysfunction in tau - P301S hippocampal neurons was rescued through genetic ablation of coﬁlin [ 104 ] . In the tau - P301S tauopathy mice , chronic administration of LM11A - 31 , a small - molecule ligand for p75 neurotrophin receptor ( p75NTR ) , prevented ac - tivation of c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) pathway and normalized coﬁlin phosphorylation at Ser - 3 [ 106 ] . Notably , LM11A - 31 lessened the dendritic spine degeneration and improved hippocampal behaviors , suggesting coﬁlin association in tauopathies [ 106 ] . Decreased CAP2 and increased coﬁlin levels were reported in hippocampal postsy - naptic fractions in an AD mouse model [ 107 ] . Small hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) - mediated down - regulation of CAP2 altered dendritic and spine morphologies in cultured neurons . Additionally , induction of LTP in rat hippocampal neurons augmented CAP2 dimerization and CAP2 - coﬁlin association . This study also found a decreased hippocampal CAP2 pro - tein level and a reduction in the ratio of CAP2 / coﬁlin in AD patients compared to healthy controls , implicating CAPs in AD pathophysiology [ 107 ] . 4 . 2 . Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with diverse symptoms , in - cluding hallucination , delusions , restricted emotion , and other cognitive impairments affecting memory , attention , and executive functions ( review [ 108 , 109 ] ) . Synaptic dys - functions such as altered synaptic plasticity and synapse formation have been reported in schizophrenia [ 110 , 111 ] . Schizophrenia has been genetically associated with the opi - oid binding protein / cell adhesion molecule ( OPCML ) , which is abundantly expressed in CNS , especially in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex [ 112 ] . OPCML polymorphisms showed association with risks to schizophrenia and some other psychiatric disorders [ 113 ] . Opcml - deﬁcient ( Opcml − / − ) mice also displayed abnormal sensorimotor gating and im - paired cognitive behaviors similar to schizophrenia [ 114 ] . OPCML was found to interact with EphB2 and control spine stability by regulating the ephrin - EphB2 - coﬁlin signaling pathway . Notably , a pharmacologic intervention with aripiprazole administration restored the abnormal behaviors in Opcml − / − mice by increasing p - coﬁlin and facilitating spine maturation [ 114 ] . This report suggests that decreased phosphorylation of coﬁlin might be involved in schizophrenia pathophysiology . Another study reported that functional inhibition of 14 - 3 - 3 protein in neurons in the mouse nervous system lead to behavioral deﬁcits corresponding to the core symptoms of schizophrenia [ 115 ] . A low level of phosphorylated coﬁlin and NMDA hypofunction were observed in the mutant mice , suggesting that disruption of the 14 - 3 - 3 protein function might cause schizophrenia symptoms through an aberration of actin dynamics . The authors suggested that the 14 - 3 - 3 protein indirectly regulates p - coﬁlin level through the Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10727 11 of 18 δ - catenin signaling pathway rather than altering p - coﬁlin through a direct protein - protein interaction [ 115 ] . 4 . 3 . Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Stroke Immediately after ischemic stroke , neuronal cell death occurs rapidly due to initial loss of blood ﬂow , increased oxidative stress by an overload of cytosolic Ca 2 + , increased excitotoxicity , lack of oxygen , and glucose . Overload of Ca 2 + activates NADPH - oxidase ( NOX ) through PKC and nitric oxide ( NO ) , leading to a high level of glutamate accumula - tion in extracellular space ( reviewed in [ 116 , 117 ] ) . Glutamate causes excitotoxicity at higher doses by overstimulating NMDA , AMPA receptors , Ca 2 + overload , and mitochondrial dysfunction [ 118 ] . Several studies reported that both non - NMDA and NMDA receptors can stimulate glutamate - induced coﬁlin dephosphorylation and rod formation [ 119 – 121 ] . Dur - ing excitotoxic neuronal death , NMDARs stimulation promotes coﬁlin dephosphorylation by the Ca 2 + - SSH1 - coﬁlin pathway in cortical neurons where coﬁlin physiologically remains phosphorylated . NMDA - induced coﬁlin dephosphorylation enhances coﬁlin translocation in mitochondria and decreases p - coﬁlin level in the cytosol . Coﬁlin contributes to the translocation of Bax into mitochondria . [ 122 ] , promoting mitochondrial membrane depo - larization and releasing apoptotic factors like cytochrome C . Acute knockdown of coﬁlin or SSH1 exhibited a marked neuroprotective action on NMDA - mediated neuronal death [ 122 ] . Another recent study demonstrated that rod - induced microtubule - associated protein - 2 ( MAP2 ) degradation and coﬁlin - mediated apoptosis are reduced if coﬁlin is inhibited by LIMK1 overexpression in the infarct cortex after stroke [ 123 ] . Moreover , coﬁlin oxidation may lead to oxidant - induced apoptosis [ 124 ] . Ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke - induced oxidative stress might be a consequence of ROS - induced coﬁlin oxidation , which translocates free coﬁlin into the mitochondria , thereby initiates cytochrome C release leading to apoptosis [ 125 ] . During the acute phase of ischemic injury and the initial phase of secondary injury to intracranial hemorrhage ( ICH ) , inhibition of elevated coﬁlin activation in the extracellular region either using pharmacological inhibitor or via phosphorylation could diminish excitotoxicity - induced neuronal death ( reviewed in [ 126 ] ) . Using a rat stroke model , Shu et al . ( 2019 ) suggested that rod formation disrupts dendritic mitochondrial trafﬁcking during ischemic conditions [ 120 ] . Accumulation of rods induced impaired synaptic structure and blockade of dendritic trafﬁcking in the brain , whereas elevation of p - coﬁlin level successfully inhibited rod formation and rescued synaptic structure [ 120 ] . Pharmacological induction of the 70 kDa heat shock protein ( HSP70 ) has been sug - gested as a potential therapeutic intervention for stroke [ 127 ] . The HSP70 - deﬁcient mice exhibited an increased coﬁlin - actin rod and a larger lesion size in the ischemic border zone . In contrast , HSP70 overexpression in transgenic mice reduced rod formation and improved neurological symptoms following stroke [ 128 ] . These reports indicate that coﬁlin is necessary during the recovery phase of stroke , and perturbed coﬁlin activity during this period might negatively affect the regenerative process . Therefore , rod suppression via coﬁlin modulation could emerge as an efﬁcacious treatment approach for ischemic stroke . 4 . 4 . Parkinson’s Disease ( PD ) PD is another age - related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the dopamin - ergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra and by the presence of Lewy neurites ( LNs ) and Lewy bodies ( LBs ) in cortical and subcortical neurons [ 129 ] . A signiﬁcant component of LBs and LNs is the misfolded alpha - synuclein ( α - synuclein ) , a conventional protein widely distributed in CNS , mainly in the presynaptic nerve terminals [ 130 ] . It has been suggested that α - synuclein exerts its pathologic function in a cell - autonomous manner in the neuronal cytoplasm and may amplify and propagate PD - related pathology [ 131 ] . Extracellular α - synucleins upregulate surface - exposed glucose - related protein of 78kDa ( GRP78 , an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone ) that becomes clustered into mi - Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10727 12 of 18 crodomains of the neuronal plasma membrane [ 132 ] . Interaction of α - synucleins and GRP78 activates a signaling cascade , which could phosphorylate / inactivate coﬁlin and pro - mote actin stabilization and stress ﬁbers formation . Downregulation of GRP78 abolishes α - synuclein - driven coﬁlin phosphorylation and actin stabilization . Alpha - synuclein has also been correlated with PAK2 and Rac1 phosphorylation , which mediates coﬁlin phosphoryla - tion via LIMK , implicating the Rac1 / PAK2 / LIMK / coﬁlin pathway in α - synuclein - induced actin - alteration [ 132 ] . Interestingly , α - synuclein - induced cytoskeletal - associated defects in axonal development could be prevented by coﬁlin activation in cultured hippocampal neurons [ 21 ] . The pathological α - synuclein - ﬁbrils are transmitted from the ﬁbril - generating cells to recipient cells and spread throughout the brain . Coﬁlin was found to facilitate the α - synuclein - ﬁbril uptake into recipient cells and the expansion of α - synuclein pathology [ 133 ] . The combined ﬁbrils consisting of α - synuclein and coﬁlin are more compact and more potent than aggregated α - synuclein - ﬁbril . Though the underlying mechanism of coﬁlin - α - synuclein - ﬁbril interaction is unknown , it is deducible that in the presence of α - synuclein - ﬁbrils , coﬁlin may alter the membrane barrier by depolymerizing actin and form vesicles to promote endocytosis [ 133 ] . Upregulation of coﬁlin by silencing ROCK1 and Rho was found to increase α - synuclein - ﬁbril entry , whereas coﬁlin downregulation decreased the α - synuclein - ﬁbril entry into the cell [ 134 ] . The authors suggested that the Rho - ROCK1 - LIMK - coﬁlin signaling pathway triggers α - synuclein - ﬁbril uptake into the host cells , and the pathogenic impact of α - synuclein in the actin cytoskeleton proceeds through coﬁlin [ 134 ] . Mutations of the parkin ( PARK2 ) gene have been linked to autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism and early - onset parkinsonism [ 135 , 136 ] . Lim et al . provided evidence on functional interaction between parkin and LIMK1 in human dopaminergic neuroblastoma - derived BE ( 2 ) - M17 cell line , where parkin overexpression enhances LIMK1 - ubiquitination and reduces the level of LIMK1 - induced coﬁlin phosphorylation [ 137 ] . Further research would be necessary to substantiate the roles of coﬁlin in the pathophysiology of early - onset PD . 5 . Conclusions The ﬁndings generated from a plethora of studies implicate that proper balance in coﬁlin activity is a prerequisite for actin turnover and CNS functions . Among various regulatory pathways already discovered for coﬁlin , phosphoregulation through SSHs and LIMKs is the most critical mechanism , where the Ser - 3 residue of coﬁlin is the speciﬁc target . Roles of coﬁlin Cys - 39 and Cys - 147 residues are also becoming apparent in the context of ROS - induced rod formation in many neurodegenerative disorders . Newer studies report different molecular pathways of coﬁlin through which coﬁlin dysregulation and translocation in subcellular regions might be associated with various CNS disorders . Recent advances in experimental techniques will signiﬁcantly facilitate the understand - ing of the signaling pathways of coﬁlin function in development and disease conditions . Drugs or peptides targeting the critical amino acid residues of coﬁlin might be a new potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative disorders . Author Contributions : Conceptualization , J .
