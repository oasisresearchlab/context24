Received 2 April 2018 ; Revised 18 June 2018 ; Accepted 11 July 2018 Abstract During mitosis , cells undergo symmetrical cell division , while oocyte meiotic maturation under - goes two consecutive , asymmetric divisions that generate a totipotent haploid oocyte and two small polar bodies not involved in DNA replication . This specialized division allows most maternal components to be maintained in the oocytes for early embryo development . Nuclear positioning , germinal vesicle breakdown , spindle migration , spindle rotation , chromosome segregation , and polar body extrusion are the most critical cellular processes during oocyte meiosis I and II , and a growing number of studies primarily using the mouse oocyte model revealed that actin ﬁlaments were critical for these processes , especially for spindle migration . Several important molecules have been reported to be involved in these processes . One family of molecules are the small GT - Pases , such as Rho GTPases , Ran GTPases , and Rab GTPases and another are the actin nucleators , such as the formin family and the Arp2 / 3 complex . The present review summarizes recent progress made regarding the roles of actin ﬁlaments in the asymmetric oocyte division . Summary Sentence Actin ﬁlaments widely involve into multiple cellular processes such as nuclear positioning , germinal vesicle breakdown , spindle migration , chromosome segregation , spindle rotation and polar body extrusion in oocyte mammalian meiosis . Key words : oocyte , actin , spindle migration , asymmetric division , polar body extrusion . Introduction During oocyte maturation , mammalian oocytes undergo asymmet - ric cell division and generate a totipotent haploid oocyte and a small polar body not involved in DNA replication , which is essential for retention of the maternal oocyte components [ 1 ] . Full - grown oocytes arrested at the germinal vesicle ( GV ) stage resume meiosis after ger - minal vesicle breakdown ( GVBD ) . During meiosis I ( MI ) , the mam - malian oocyte spindle is organized at or near the center of the cy - toplasm , and after chromosomes align in the equatorial plate of the oocyte , the spindle migrates along its long axis toward the clos - est cortex [ 2 , 3 ] . The mammalian oocyte does not have the typical centrosomes and astral microtubules for spindle assembly , which is different from mitosis [ 4 ] . The barrel - shaped spindle assembly de - pends on the self - organization of numerous acentriolar microtubule organizing centers ( MTOCs ) , which replace the centrosome function during mammalian oocyte maturation [ 5 , 6 ] . The spindle migrates to the oocyte cortex in an actin - dependent manner in MI . When the spindle migrates to the oocyte cortex , the actin accumulates in the cortical region surrounded by a myosin II ring overlay of the spin - dle . After extrusion of the ﬁrst polar body , the oocyte quickly enters metaphase of meiosis II ( MII ) , and the spindle assemblies near the ﬁrst division site beneath the oocyte cortex , where a cortical myosin C (cid:3) The Author ( s ) 2018 .

A schematic illustration of oocyte maturation in a mouse model . Af - ter germinal vesicle breakdown , the spindle forms in the center of the oocyte and actin ﬁlaments distribute uniformly at the oocyte cortex . Subsequently , the spindle moves to the oocyte cortex and the cortex actin accumulates to form an actin cap that overlays the spindle . After the cortical contractile ring constricts , the oocyte extrudes the ﬁrst polar body and enters the MII stage . After fertilization , the spindle enters the anaphase , and the spindle rotates 90 ◦ for the second polar body extrusion . Red : actin ; Yellow : cortical granule ; Green : spindle ; Blue : DNA . II ring also forms above the spindle , similar with what happens in MI . After sperm penetration , the spindle rotates and the oocyte ex - trudes the second polar body [ 7 , 8 ] . Therefore , the spindle position and cortical polarization are critical for the oocyte meiotic divisions ( Figure 1 ) . Recent work uncovered potential molecular mechanisms of the spindle position and cortical polarization control in mam - malian oocyte MI and II , which generally indicates that actin ﬁlaments play critical roles in these processes [ 9 – 15 ] . The current review presents a comprehensive overview of research looking at the regulatory mechanisms of actin in the asymmetric oocytes division of mammals . Control of nuclear positioning in oocyte meiosis In most cells , centrosomes play critical roles in nuclear positioning . During cell migration , nuclear movements are regulated by Cdc42 , MRCK , and myosin , and actin ﬂow establishes MTOC polariza - tion [ 16 ] . In addition , microtubules can attach to the nucleus and position the nucleus independently of centrosome [ 17 ] . Thus , both microtubules and centrosomes play key roles in nuclear position - ing . However , mammalian oocytes have unique properties in that the centrosomes and astral microtubules do not exist during oocyte meiosis [ 2 , 5 ] , which indicates that there is another mechanism that regulates nuclear positioning in mammalian oocytes . During oocyte meiosis , the precise nuclear position deﬁnes the spindle migration start site , which further affects the ﬁrst asymmetric division and functional gamete formation . Nuclear position is related with meiotic competence . In some mammalian species like the mouse and rat , the GV is localized in the central oocyte during the ﬁrst meiosis . Oocytes with central GV positions exhibit a higher meiotic competence compared with that of eccentric GV positions . Moreover , a higher percentage of oocytes from aged mice exhibited eccentric GV positions [ 18 , 19 ] . In addi - tion , aging oocytes have actin nucleator degradation , which is shown by decreases in Arp2 / 3 , WAVE , and JMY expression [ 20 ] . Therefore , F - actin might be involved in GV positioning in mammalian oocyte [ 21 ] . It was shown that most nuclei of the actin nucleator formin 2 − / − oocytes were off - center , which were associated with a lack of cytoplasmic F - actin [ 22 , 23 ] . However , how formin 2 and actin ﬁl - aments maintain central nuclear localization in cytoplasm remains unclear . The actin mesh reappeared 30 min after formin 2 mRNA was injected into formin 2 − / − oocytes , and the nucleus moved from the cortex to the center within 5 h after injection [ 24 ] . In addition , formin - 2 expression in wild - type ( WT ) oocytes induced local accu - mulation of actin around the nucleus and pushed the nucleus to migrate towards the cortex [ 12 ] . Overall , these results strongly indi - cated that formin 2 generates the force to maintain the nucleus in a central location within the GV oocytes . Interestingly , after oocytes were treated with cytochalasin D , the nucleus remained in the cen - ter of the cytoplasm , and no nuclei were off - center , which indicated that the actin ﬁlaments were not necessary to maintain the nucleus in the center position [ 24 ] . Therefore , formin 2 might have other mechanisms for nuclear positioning . Recent work showed that vesicles could assemble an extensive actin network from vesicle surfaces by recruiting the actin nucle - ation factors , spire 1 / 2 and formin 2 , which further regulated spin - dle migration towards the oocyte cortex [ 15 ] . Meanwhile , the actin - interacting vesicles that moved towards the cortex was in a myosin Vb - dependent manner , which was essential for asymmetric spindle positioning in mouse oocytes , and the failure of network reorgani - zation caused a defect in the movement of actin - interacting vesicles [ 14 , 15 ] . To test whether myosin Vb could connect with actin vesi - cles and exert functions on nuclear movement , the myosin Vb tail was injected into mouse oocytes . The results indicated that cytoplas - mic ﬂow decreased , and the nucleus failed to migrate , suggesting that myosin Vb is involved in nuclear positioning . Furthermore , the oocyte elastic and viscous moduli were signiﬁcantly increased after the Myosin Vb tail was expressed in the WT oocyte , which demon - strated that Myosin Vb could make the cytoplasm more ﬂuidic and contribute to nuclear directional movements toward the cell cen - ter [ 24 ] . A previous study reported that myosin Vb played critical roles in spindle migration during meiotic division , and whether the functions of myosin Vb in spindle migration were associated with cytoplasmic viscosity needs further exploration [ 14 ] . Overall , the above evidence demonstrated that active diffusion of actin - vesicles could move large organelles such as nuclei in oocyte meiosis , and myosin Vb might be involved in this process . Moreover , the porcine GV oocyte nucleus was in an eccentric position either during the antral stage or in the mature oocyte [ 25 ] , which promotes the ques - tion as to why oocytes have different oocyte GV positions in different species . Control of GV breakdown in oocyte meiosis After hormone stimulation , oocytes resume ﬁrst meiosis with GVBD , where chromosomes condense and the meiotic spindle assembles in the oocyte center and migrates to the cortex before polar body extrusion occurs [ 26 ] . It was reported that GVBD was precisely controlled by histone modiﬁcations , protein kinases / phosphatases , centrosomes , and cytoskeleton - related proteins [ 27 – 33 ] . A recent study demonstrated an exception for microtubular function in nu - clear breakdown and showed a different mechanism regulating nu - clear envelope break down ( NEBD ) in starﬁsh oocytes . This study suggested that the Arp2 / 3 complex functions in long , unbranched actin bundles that were essential for F - actin shell nucleation , causing further nuclear membrane fragmentation and facilitating NEBD ; meanwhile , the Arp2 / 3 complex - nucleated F - actin shell was D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / b i o l r ep r od / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 100 / 1 / 15 / 5053800 b y O U P s i t e a cc e ss u s e r on 18 M a r c h 2019 X . Duan and S . - C . Sun , 2019 , Vol . 100 , No . 1 17 critical in preventing aneuploidy during starﬁsh meiosis [ 34 ] . To date , nuclear actin has been implicated in various functional roles of chromatin remodeling , transcription , stabilization , and organization of giant nuclei [ 35 – 40 ] . Even though the functions of nuclear actin have been widely reported , whether the nuclear actin is involved in mammalian oocyte GVBD is still unknown . But after cytochalasin B treatment , the oocyte could undergo GVBD and the mitochon - dria distribution was normal [ 41 ] , which is paradoxical with above reports . This may be due to the different species . A previous study revealed that before GVBD , the cytoplasmic actin density was signif - icantly decreased in mouse oocyte , indicating that the cytoplasmic actin might block GVBD [ 22 ] . Therefore , the function of nuclear actin in GVBD during mammalian oocyte meiosis needs to be stud - ied further . Control of spindle migration in oocyte meiosis After GVBD , a microtubule organizes and forms a spindle at the original nuclear position , and then the spindle moves toward the cortex roughly along its long axis until the leading pole of the spin - dle reaches the oocyte cortex at the end of MI . Subsequently , the oocyte extrudes the ﬁrst polar body [ 42 ] . In mitosis , spindle position is decided by the interaction between cortical microﬁlaments and as - tral microtubules [ 43 ] . However , in mammalian oocytes , spindle mi - gration is independent of the microtubule , which was demonstrated by a nocodazole treatment study [ 2 , 44 ] . In contrast , actin plays critical roles in spindle migration and cortical polarization during oocyte meiosis [ 42 ] . Cytochalasin B , an inhibitor of actin polymer - ization , causes chromosome migration failure in oocyte meiosis . On the other hand , an inhibitor of actin depolymerization , jasplakino - lide , also blocks chromosome migration during oocyte meiosis [ 44 , 45 ] . Recent studies demonstrated the potential actin mechanisms during spindle migration and during the establishment of cortical polarity the asymmetric oocyte division of mammals . The small GTPases in spindle migration Ras , Rab , Rho , Ran , and Arf subfamilies are the members of the small GTPase superfamily , which plays critical roles in cell differen - tiation , cell division , vesicle transportation , nuclear assembly , and the cytoskeleton dynamics . Small GTPases function by the cycling of active GTP - bound and inactive GDP - bound states [ 46 , 47 ] , and their functions in cytoskeleton dynamics have been extensively reported during the asymmetric oocyte division of mammals [ 14 , 48 – 52 ] . Rho GTPases The main members of the Rho subfamily are RhoA , Cdc42 , and Rac1 , which are extensively involved in various cellular processes such as cell growth , motility , polarity , and adhesion [ 53 ] . In mouse and frog oocytes , RhoA accumulated at the contractile ring of telophase I and was involved in the late phases of meiosis ; the mei - otic spindle failed to rotate and extrude the polar body after RhoA inhibitor treatment [ 54 , 55 ] . In addition , RhoA knockdown caused aberrant actin assembly and spindle localization in porcine oocytes [ 51 ] . Similar results were also reported when the Rho - associated kinase , an effector of Rho , was disrupted and caused spindle mi - gration and actin assembly to fail in mouse oocytes [ 56 , 57 ] . In addition , RhoA also regulated actin assembly and spindle position - ing by mediating formin - like 1 during asymmetric oocyte division in mice [ 58 ] . Another Rho GTPase , Cdc42 , is distributed at the oocyte cortex and spindle in mouse and porcine oocytes [ 59 ] . Injection of mutated Cdc42 or Cdc42 knockdown caused spindle migration failure and aberrant cortical polarity establishment [ 59 – 61 ] . However , recent work showed that speciﬁc Cdc42 depletion with a knockout mouse model did not affect meiotic spindle migration but caused aberrant cortical polarity and polar body extrusion in mouse oocytes [ 48 ] . Furthermore , speciﬁc N - WASP depletion did not affect spindle mi - gration and asymmetric division during the MI but did cause failure to complete cytokinesis during MII , which showed a different phe - notype compared with in vitro experiments [ 62 ] . Rac , another member of Rho GTPases , distributes to the cor - tex of mouse oocytes and primarily accumulates in the cortical re - gions overlying the spindle during MI and MII . The expression of dominant - negative Rac caused failure of chromosome alignment in MI and aberrant spindle positioning in MII [ 63 ] . In pig oocytes , inhibition of Rac1 activity by NSC23766 caused aberrant spindle localization , which further affected polar body extrusions in the ﬁrst asymmetric divisions [ 64 ] . However , in the Rac1 knockout mouse model , oocytes extruded polar bodies normally and fertility was not affected [ 65 ] . Whether compensatory effects were present in the in vivo model needs further study . Ran GTPases Ran GTPase acts a diffusible signal emanating from the chromosome to the cortex and further mediates cortical actomyosin cap forma - tion in oocytes during MII . Injection of DNA beads into oocytes induced cortical actin cap formation , while the size of cortical actin cap depended on the number of DNA beads and the distance between the DNA beads and the cortex . In addition , injecting a dominant - negative Ran mutation caused cortical cap formation failure after DNA beads were injected [ 66 ] . However , RanT24N oocyte injec - tions had no effect on mouse oocyte ﬁrst polar body extrusions , but could cause a defect in actin cap formation [ 67 ] . These results in - dicated that a variety of mechanisms for cortical polarization and spindle position might exist in MI and MII . Previous work suggested that Ran could regulate the localization and activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex at the oocyte cortex , and then the Arp2 / 3 complex fur - ther maintained the chromosomes / spindle at the cortex and retained cortical polarization in oocytes during MII . After Ran activity was disrupted , abnormal N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 complex localizations oc - curred . N - WASP knockdown was also blocked by Arp2 / 3 activation at the oocyte cortex . Therefore , chromosomes locally activate the Arp2 / 3 complex through the Ran / N - WASP signaling pathway to maintain cortical cap formation and spindle position in oocytes dur - ing MII [ 13 ] . Cdc42 accumulation in the cortical region occurred in a Ran - dependent manner . Cdc42 inhibition caused aberrant N - WASP localization , which further affected cortical actin cap formation and caused detachment of the spindle from the cortex in oocytes dur - ing MII [ 50 ] . These results demonstrated that the functions of the Cdc42 - N - WASP - Arp2 / 3 pathway on spindle position and cortical polarization are regulated by Ran GTP . Moreover , Ran GTP also regulated cortical actin cap formation in the cortical region by medi - ating ERM ( Ezrin / Radixin / Moesin ) dephosphorylation . Meanwhile , the functions of Ran in ERM dephosphorylation were independent of Rac and Cdc42 . After Rac and Cdc42 activity was disrupted , a polarized phospho - ERM exclusion was still detected [ 49 ] . Previ - ous work showed that Rac also accumulated in the cortical region when the chromosomes were close to oocyte cortex , indicating that Ran - mediated chromosome signaling can activate Rac and further mediate cortex polarization [ 66 ] . In addition , Rac inhibition caused the failure of actin cap formation and the detachment of the spindle from the oocyte cortex in MII . Thus , the Ran - Rac - Wave2 - Arp2 / 3 complex signaling pathway is also involved in cortical polarization D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / b i o l r ep r od / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 100 / 1 / 15 / 5053800 b y O U P s i t e a cc e ss u s e r on 18 M a r c h 2019 18 Actin dynamics in oocytes , 2019 , Vol . 100 , No . 1 Figure 2 .

Red : actin ; Green : spindle ; Blue : DNA and the spindle position during the MII [ 63 , 68 , 69 ] . Taken together , these results suggest that Ran regulates the cortical actin processes through multiple signaling pathways ( Figure 2 ) [ 70 ] , but how Ran activates these signaling pathways remains unknown . Rab GTPases The Rab family is the largest branch of the Ras superfamily . In humans , more than 60 members have been identiﬁed . Several Rab GTPases play critical roles in vesicle formation and trafﬁcking [ 71 ] . Rab GTPases function in vesicle transport associated with actin or microtubules processes [ 72 ] . Rab11 - positive vesicles recruited the actin nucleation factors , spire 1 / 2 and formin 2 , for actin assem - bly on the vesicle surfaces , and myosin Vb directed the vesicle - actin network to the oocyte cortex [ 15 ] . Spire 1 / 2 or formin 2 depletion caused a decrease in the speed of the vesicle to the cortex , and similar results were found after cytochalasin - D treatment . Therefore , spire 1 / 2 and formin 2 treatment might nucleate cytoplasmic actin for vesicle movement [ 73 ] . Moreover , high - resolution living - cell imag - ing showed that actin connected neighboring vesicles . When the actin network was disrupted , vesicles failed to converge and little vesicles appeared in the cytoplasm , indicating that actin functions in vesicle convergence [ 15 ] . Previous work showed that spire 1 / 2 and formin 2 could regulate the plus ends of actin formation [ 74 – 77 ] , which was essential for vesicle convergence . The myosin motor proteins are involved in various cellular processes together with the actin cytoskeleton [ 78 ] , and function in long - range transport associated with the plus end of actin . Dominant - negative myosin Vb is ex - pressed in mouse oocytes and disrupted vesicle convergence and the outward movement of vesicles . Because spire 1 / 2 and formin 2 were also distributed in the oocyte cortex , Myosin Vb movement was able to connect the cortical plus end of actin and transport the vesicles toward the oocyte cortex [ 15 ] . Moreover , the vesicle - dependent dy - namics of the actin network was essential for asymmetric spindle migration during mouse oocyte maturation . Vesicles are important for the actin network to act in a myosin Vb - dependent manner and can modulate actin network densities by clustering and sequester - ing the network nucleators , such as formin 2 and spire 1 / 2 [ 14 ] . Rab11a - positive vesicle depletion disrupted asymmetric spindle po - sitioning and polar body extrusions , while actin network organiza - tion was static but not disrupted . Therefore , the static actin network might induce the failure of spindle migration . Artiﬁcial stabilization of the actin network was performed by overexpressing the actin - binding domain , utrophin , and disrupting spindle migration , which suggested that the outward and directed movement of vesicles by the actin network was critical for spindle migration in the asymmetric oocyte division [ 14 , 15 ] . Dominant - negative myosin Vb expression also blocked actin network actions and spindle migration . Therefore , the Rab11a - positive vesicles could recruit the myosin Vb and further regulate the actin network processes for spindle migration [ 14 ] . In addition , another study showed that spindle migration was pushed by cytoplasmic ﬂow during MI [ 12 ] , but whether the cytoplasmic ﬂow is caused by the vesicle - dependent actions of the actin network needs further study . Recent studies demonstrated that other members of the Rab GT - Pases also played essential roles in cortical polarization during asym - metric ooctye division . Rab3a depletion caused the failure of actin cap formation and spindle migration during asymmetric oocyte di - vision . Moreover , Rab6a was also involved in cortical polarization during MI [ 52 , 79 ] . However , whether Rab6a and Rab3a are asso - ciated with the vesicle - dependent actions of the actin network for oocyte cortical polarization and spindle migration has not been clar - iﬁed . The actin nucleators in spindle migration During mammalian oocyte meiosis , the actin dependent - asymmetric position of the spindle is essential for the successful generation of a large and fertilizable egg .

Duan and S . - C . Sun , 2019 , Vol . 100 , No . 1 19 branched ( Arp2 / 3 ) actin nucleators were shown to have important roles in controlling the spindle position during mouse oocyte meiosis by using different F - actin binding probes [ 12 , 23 , 44 , 73 , 80 – 84 ] . The Formin family The functions of the formin family in actin assembly is controlled by the formin homology ( FH ) domains , FH1 and FH2 play critical roles in several formin activities [ 85 ] . Formin 2 , as an actin nucleator , was localized at the oocyte cortex and the central oocyte region around the spindle and was also co - localized with actin in the oocytes [ 44 , 84 , 86 , 87 ] . In formin 2 − / – oocyte , the cytoplasmic actin network signiﬁcantly decreased , and the spindle failed to migrate towards the cortex . Injection of formin 2 mRNA rescued the aberrant spindle po - sition and blocked symmetric division . Two possible mechanisms for spindle migration in meiotic oocytes include ( 1 ) that formin 2 medi - atesactinnetworkformationandpushesthespindletooocytecortex , and ( 2 ) that the phospho - activated form of myosin II , found at the spindle poles , accumulates actin near the spindle poles to generate a pulling force for spindle migration [ 86 ] . In addition , in MI the actin cloud appeared behind the chromosomes and generated a pushing force for spindle migration [ 44 ] . Overall , pulling and pushing forces control spindle migration in the ﬁrst asymmetric division . Formin 2 might not just exert a direct pushing force since , after GVBD , formin 2 was recruited to ER structures around the spindle where actin was polymerized . Meanwhile , either formin 2 or actin was uni - formly distributed around the spindle before spindle migration [ 12 ] . Two types of chromosome movements were found in MI . In the ﬁrst phase , the chromosomes moved randomly , and in the second phase , chromosomes moved to the cortex with higher speeds and straighter trajectories [ 12 ] . In formin 2 − / – oocytes , the random movement of chromosomes disappeared , which indicated that formin 2 was es - sential for the random movements in the ﬁrst phase [ 22 , 84 , 86 ] . It is possible that formin 2 - ER is distributed around the spindle , where it polymerizes actin before spindle movement occurs and induces undirected pushing forces for random spindle movements . After the ﬁrst phase , chromosomes quickly move to the oocyte cortex , while in MII , cytoplasmic streaming forms and maintains the spindle close to the cortex . The Arp2 / 3 complex The Arp2 / 3 complex also participates in oocyte spindle migration . When chromosomes moved to the oocyte cortex , chromosomes trig - gered Arp2 / 3 complex activation and induced cortical polarization [ 66 ] . CK666 inhibited the Arp2 / 3 complex causing disruption of cytoplasmic ﬂow and further abolishing the second phase of straight and accelerated movements . Meanwhile , Arp2 / 3 complex inhibition also caused failure of cytoplasmic ﬂow and detachment of the spindle from the cortex in oocytes during MII [ 12 , 13 ] . Interestingly , formin 2 was also involved in the second phase of chromosome movement . In formin 2 − / − oocytes , chromosomes had a natural tendency to localize near the oocyte cortex , but the Arp2 / 3 complex was not activated and cytoplasmic ﬂow was not generated , which indicated that formin 2 might play a role in communication between chro - mosomes and the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 12 ] . Thus , another mechanism for the regulation of spindle migration has been found : ﬁrst , formin 2 - ER generates the pushing force for random chromosome move - ments , and second , when the chromosomes are close enough to the cortex , they can activate the Arp2 / 3 complex and stimulate cytoplasmic ﬂow to push the chromosomes toward the oocyte cortex ( Figure 3 ) . This model does not exclude the pushing force of Figure 3 . The positive feedback loop between chromosome signal - induced Arp2 / 3 activation and the Arp2 / 3 regulation of cytoplasmic ﬂow for the cortical relocation of chromosomes . After spindle formation , the formin 2 - ER complex distributes uniformly around the spindle and moves the spindle / chromosomes randomly during the meiosis I . Subsequently , chro - mosome signals activate the Arp2 / 3 complex at the cortex and regulate cytoplasmic ﬂow that pushes the chromosomes / spindle further towards the cortex during meiosis II . formin 2 during the second chromosome movement phase because it accumulated behind the spindle or chromosomes [ 23 , 84 , 86 ] . How - ever , no evidence has been identiﬁed which suggested that formin 2 was involved in spindle positioning during the second asymmetric division . One study showed that in addition to the Arp2 / 3 complex functions on cytoplasmic ﬂow , the Arp2 / 3 complex also suppressed the function of myosin II on cortical cap contraction during the second asymmetric division . Arp2 / 3 complex inhibition caused reverse streaming driven by myosin II - based cortical contraction , which led the spindle away from of the cortex in oocytes during MII [ 13 ] . Therefore , a positive feedback loop was established for spindle positioning during the second asymmetric division , which involved Ran - dependent chromosome signals activating Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization to suppress myosin II functions during cortical cap contraction and to regulate cytoplasmic ﬂow . In turn , the cytoplasmic ﬂow further pushed and maintained the spindle at the oocyte cortex . Overall , the Arp2 / 3 complex induces cytoplasmic ﬂow in oocytes during MI and MII which further pushes the spindle to migrate to the oocyte cortex in the MI and maintains the spindle position in MII . However , different mechanisms for Arp2 / 3 complex activation exist ; in MI , random chromosome movement , induced by formin 2 , activates the Arp2 / 3 complex , whereas in MII , Ran - dependent chromosomes activate the Arp2 / 3 complex . The cortical actions on spindle migration During mitosis , actin and the microtubules act together to regulate morphogenetic cellular events , which are essential for cell shape , margin retraction , and rounding , and establishment of the mitotic spindle [ 88 , 89 ] . Furthermore , mitotic cell sphering and increased cortica tension could support correct spindle morphogenesis and orientation , which was shown to be regulated by myosin II and ERM family proteins [ 90 – 94 ] . However , in contrast to mitotic cells , oocyte cortical stiffness decreased 6 - fold from the GV to the MII stages , and this decrease only occurred in the cortical polarity region and not in the entire oocyte cortex [ 95 ] . And this decreased cortical tension was shown to be associated with the Mos - MAPK signaling pathway that mediates myosin II exclusion from the cortex [ 11 ] . In Mos − / – oocytes , cortical F - actin tension was absent but cytoplasmic F - actin was present , indicating that Mos was involved in cortical po - larization [ 2 ] . Micropipette aspiration analysis showed that cortical tension was not decreased in Mos − / – oocytes , which established the relationship between Mos and cortical tension [ 11 ] .

In oocyte meiosis , decreased cortical tension could be associated with myosin II . Further research revealed that in WT oocytes , when the spindle migrated to the oocyte cortex , cortical myosin II gradually disap - peared from the cortex , but in Mos − / – oocytes , myosin II did not disappear in the oocyte cortex , which caused the cortical tension to remain static and not decrease , and therefore , was related to myosin II exclusion from the oocyte cortex . Previous studies showed that during oocyte meiosis , myosin II was distributed at the spindle poles and generated the pulling force for spindle migration [ 86 , 96 ] . To demonstrate whether cortex softening was required for spindle mi - gration , concanavalin A was used to stiffen the cortex [ 92 , 95 , 97 , 98 ] . After concanavalin A treatment , the spindle failed to migrate to the cortex , which suggested that the soft cortex was essential for spindle migration during MI [ 11 ] . Another study revealed that the overlap in actin intensity between the leading pole and its nearest cortex was signiﬁcantly higher compared with the lagging pole and its nearest cortex during oocyte meiotic spindle migration . Mean - while , as the overlapped actin intensity increased at the leading pole , the speed of spindle migration was signiﬁcantly increased , which indicated an increase in the pulling force [ 2 , 10 ] . In addition , dur - ing oocyte meiosis , myosin II was found at the spindle poles , which caused myosin II activity inhibition and the spindle migration failure [ 86 , 95 , 96 ] . Based on these results , we concluded that myosin II ex - clusion from the cortex was essential for pulling forces and spindle migration . For the question of how cytoplasmic and cortical actin interact to move the spindle , a model showing that cytoplasmic actin penetrated the oocyte cortex and that cortical actin was extracted from the cortex explained the actin overlap . Moreover , this model was associated with cortical tension . If the cortical tension was too tight , cytoplasmic actin would not penetrate the cortex ; however , if the cortical tension was too soft , the cortex would not support the pulling force . Based on this hypothesis , increased or decreased corti - cal tension could cause the failure of spindle movement . This model identiﬁed that high cortical tension caused spindle migration to fail in Mos − / – oocytes [ 10 , 11 ] . Another study showed that Mos - MAPK could phosphorylate Wave2 and regulate Arp2 / 3 - dependent cortical F - actin thickening . To further explore the Mos - MAPK mechanism in cortical tension , the VCA domain of Wave2 was expressed to explore the cortical tension during MI [ 76 ] . The results showed that cortical VCA ( cVCA ) expression signiﬁcantly increased cortical actin thick - ness and excluded myosin II from the cortex . And cVCA expression decreased cortical tension and these oocytes were deformed and no longer round which further blocked the spindle migration . In addi - tion , in Mos − / – oocytes , expression of cVCA could rescue spindle migration by decreasing the oocyte cortical tension , which further demonstrated the relationship between cortical tension and spindle migration [ 10 ] . Above all , these studies comprehensively elaborated the signiﬁcance of cortical tension during oocyte spindle migration . During the MII , the Arp2 / 3 complex inhibited the function of myosin II in cortical cap contraction at the oocyte cortex , which might be co - incident with the exclusive of myosin II from the cortex . However , whether the similar regulative mechanisms about cortical tension exist in MII is unknown . Control of chromosome segregation in oocyte meiosis Oocyte meiosis is a unique form of cell division in which the oocyte undergoes two consecutive asymmetric divisions following DNA Figure 4 . Spindle actin functions in chromosomal segregation . The K - ﬁbers cannotbeformedafterspindleactinperturbation , causingchromosomalseg - regation errors in oocytes during meiosis I and II . Red : actin ; Green : spindle ; Blue : DNA . replication in S - phase . Once chromosomes are aligned on the spindle equator , the spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) is silenced and the anaphase - promoting complex ( APC ) is activated , subsequently the chromosomes segregate , and the oocyte enters anaphase . Chromo - some segregation errors cause aneuploidy , resulting in subsequent infertility , abortion , birth defects , or Down syndrome [ 99 , 100 ] . Re - cently , an unexpected additional function of actin in mouse oocytes which called “spindle actin” plays a critical role in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation [ 101 ] . This kind of actin is distributed in the spindle ( spindle actin ) , which is parallel to microtubular arrays in both the MI and MII spindles . Spindle actin is also present in other mammalian species , such as human , porcine , and ovine eggs . When using the drug , cytochalasin D , to disrupt actin ﬁlaments , the speed of chromosomes moving toward spindle poles was relatively slow . More importantly , chromosomes were not aligned well during segre - gation . In addition , the misaligned chromosomes were also observed in formin 2 − / − oocyte , which indicated that chromosome segrega - tion was also regulated by spindle actin . Meanwhile , the function of spindle actin also persisted in oocytes during MII . Therefore , the spindle actin is essential for chromosome segregation in MI and MII . The incorrect kinetochore - microtubule attachment frequently causes chromosome lagging [ 102 ] . However , no effect on the kinetochore - microtubule attachment after cytochalasin D treatment was found . Spindle actin is likely involved in the formation of K - ﬁbers either in cytochalasin D - treated oocytes or formin 2 − / – oocytes ( Figure 4 ) . But the question of how actin controls K - ﬁber formation remains . Previous studies showed that spindle matrix could also align spindle microtubules . Whenirradiationseveredthekinetochore - microtubule ﬁber , the kinetochore continued to move toward spindle poles with - out connections to the pole [ 103 , 104 ] . Therefore , the function of spindle actin in chromosomes segregation might be related to the spindle matrix . Control of polar body extrusion during oocyte meiosis After the onset of anaphase , animal cells undergo cytokinesis that is driven by a contractile ring between the mitotic spindle poles to generate two daughter cells . The contractile ring is a network of D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / b i o l r ep r od / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 100 / 1 / 15 / 5053800 b y O U P s i t e a cc e ss u s e r on 18 M a r c h 2019 X . Duan and S . - C . Sun , 2019 , Vol . 100 , No . 1 21 actin / actomyosin and myosin II , and its constriction is driven by myosin motor activity that causes the actin ﬁlament to translocate [ 105 ] . The mammalian oocyte polar body extrusion is a unique in - stance of cytokinesis , which is coordinated by cortical membrane protrusion and actomyosin ring contraction [ 9 ] . Before polar body extrusion occurs , the spindle must position itself adjacent to the cortex . During the metaphase - anaphase transition , the contractile ring constricts and a cleavage furrow forms at the cortical region surrounding the spindle midzone to allow polar body extrusion . Subsequently , the second meiotic spindle forms and lies parallel to the actomyosin - enriched cortex . After fertilization , the spindle ro - tates about 90 ◦ to the vertical position , and the contractile ring con - stricts for the second polar body extrusion [ 3 , 8 , 82 , 106 ] . Therefore , contractile ring constriction is essential for polar body extrusion . The small GTPase , RhoA , was shown to regulate spindle rotation and promoted contractile ring assembly and furrow ingression during cytokinesis [ 54 , 107 ] . In addition , another small GTPase , Cdc42 , was shown to be involved in polar body extrusion by regulating actin cap formation . When Cdc42 was deleted in oocytes , chromo - some segregation occurred , but polar body extrusion failed , which indicated a defect in contractile ring constriction [ 48 ] . Moreover , a similar Cdc42 function was found in Xenopus oocytes , for which Cdc42 was inhibited , leading to blockage of polar body extrusion and failure of contractile ring formation , although the oocytes could initiate anaphase [ 108 , 109 ] . Cdc42 was also shown to coordinate with RhoA during oocyte polar body extrusion . In this study , Cdc42 promoted membrane protrusion , and RhoA restricted the region with the outpocket to initiate contractile ring constriction [ 55 ] . Myosin II is an important component of the contractile ring that partitions one cell into two daughter cells [ 110 , 111 ] ; myosin II in - duces F - actin bundle disintegration and is involved in cellular actin network disassembly . Mutant myosin II with impaired motor activ - ity effectively promoted cytokinesis , and this ﬁnding supports other work , which showed that the Arp2 / 3 complex could inhibit pre - mature contraction of the myosin II ring and maintain actomyosin ring formation [ 13 , 111 – 115 ] . During oocyte meiosis , myosin II was enriched in the contractile ring , which was essential for meiotic cy - tokinesis [ 96 ] . Previous studies showed that myosin II was involved in cortical tension regulation in cells with symmetric divisions , which was characterized by manipulation of myosin - II - mediated contrac - tility [ 92 , 93 , 116 , 117 ] . Moreover , in oocyte meiosis , myosin II was also associated with cortical tension for asymmetric divisions that further regulated spindle migration and polar body extrusion . Decreases in cortical tension after ML7 treatment caused spindle rotation failure and second polar body extrusion that was arrested at the anaphase II - like stage with modest protrusions over chro - matin [ 95 ] . Meanwhile , in the ﬁrst meiotic division , exclusive of myosin II from the oocyte cortex maintained the cortical tension that was essential for spindle migration and polar body extrusion [ 10 , 11 ] . However , whether this myosin II cortical tension mecha - nism occurs after MII oocyte fertilization needs further studies . Control of spindle rotation in oocytes during MII After the ﬁrst polar body extrusion , oocytes enter the metaphase II stage , in which the spindle forms beneath the cortex and is ori - ented parallel to the cortex . In some mammals , such as mice and rats , when sperm penetrates an oocyte , the spindle rotates , and the oocyte extrudes a second polar body . During this process , MII spin - dle positioning and rotation in the subcortical regions are essential for a successful second asymmetric division and fertilization . After sperm activation , the oocyte membrane undergoes protrusion and completes chromosomal segregation in anaphase . Subsequently , a unilateral membrane furrow is formed at the spindle midzone and an unbalanced force forms for the spindle rotation [ 118 ] . After actin depolymerization by cytochalasin B or D treatment , oocytes failed to undergo spindle rotation and second polar body extrusion [ 8 ] . Meanwhile , inhibition of myosin II by ML7 or blebbistatin also caused spindle rotation to fail and further prevented second polar body extrusion [ 119 ] . The small GTPase , RhoA , was also involved in spindle rotation during MII by mediating actin assembly [ 54 ] . There - fore , spindle rotation in oocytes is actin and myosin II - dependent . However , in C . elegans , the spindle rotation did not depend on actin but required cytoplasmic dynein instead . Dynein depletion caused spindle arrest parallel to the cortex and the spindle failed to rotation [ 120 ] . In rat oocytes , after microtubules were depolymerized with a drug , the MII spindle failed to rotate [ 121 ] , which indicated an interaction between actin and the microtubules during spindle rota - tion . The ADP - ribosylation factor 1 ( Arf1 ) was also shown to play critical role in regulating asymmetric oocyte divisions in mice by me - diating MAPK phosphorylation . Moreover , Arf1 inhibition causes spindle rotation to fail in oocytes during MII ; however , the potential mechanism of Arf1 in spindle rotation is still unknown [ 122 ] . Previ - ous work showed that cortical tension was decreased from the GV to MII stage ; however , after fertilization cortical tension increased again . Therefore , the cortical tension might be involved in spindle rotation during the second asymmetric division . However , the po - tential mechanisms behind control of meiotic spindle rotation need further exploration in mammalian oocytes . Conclusions and Future Directions During mammalian oocyte meiosis , the oocyte undergoes two suc - cessive asymmetric divisions that form a functional female gamete and two small polar bodies , which is essential for fertilization and embryo development . During these processes , eccentric spindle migration and cortical polarization are prerequisites for the ﬁrst meiotic division ; moreover , positioning the spindle parallel to the actomyosin - enriched cortex and completing spindle rotation is es - sential for the second asymmetric division . In the present review , we discussed the roles of actin in the asymmetric division of mammalian oocytes , especiallyconcerningspindlemigration , corticalactinpolar - ization , and spindle positioning . Recently , high - resolution imaging technology was used to explore oocyte maturation and has led re - searchers to propose new insights into the actions of actin during oocyte meiosis ; however , many questions remain . For instance , how does actin maintain the GV at the center of oocytes ? And , what trig - gers formin 2 regulation during actin assembly for random spindle migration ? Since the SAC is activated prior to chromosomal align - ment and spindle migration , the SAC might be responsible for formin 2 function inhibitions during spindle migration . When the spindle moves toward the oocyte cortex , the APC is activated and the chro - mosomes segregate ; therefore , it is unclear if the cortical actin cap triggers APC activation and chromosome segregation . What trig - gers contractile ring constriction after chromosome segregation is still unknown . Whether cytoplasmic ﬂow controls the spindle rota - tion in the second meiotic division is also unclear . Answers to these questions will lead to a better understanding of how actin controls asymmetric oocyte division . Conﬂict of Interest : The authors have declared that no conﬂict of interest exists .
