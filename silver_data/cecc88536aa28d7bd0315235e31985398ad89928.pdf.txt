NATURE MEDICINE • VOLUME 5 • NUMBER 2 • FEBRUARY 1999 157 ARTICLES Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) is the prototypic member of a fam - ily of cytokines that interact with a corresponding set of recep - tors that form the TNF receptor ( TNFR ) family 1 . Signals induced by these interactions serve such diverse functions as differentia - tion , proliferation , activation or induction of cell death by apop - tosis 2 – 4 . Three of these ligands , CD95L , TNF and LT a , have received particular attention because they can induce apoptosis in transformed cells and activated lymphocytes . In addition , mutations in either CD95 or CD95L lead to the development of autoimmune processes in both mouse and man 5 , 6 . Thus , these molecules are believed to play essential parts in the homeostatic regulation of the immune system . The potential utility of sys - temically administered CD95L , TNF and LT a is limited by their acute toxic effects on normal tissues in vivo , thereby limiting their potential widespread use in the treatment of cancer . TRAIL ( TNF - related apoptosis - inducing ligand ) is a type II transmembrane protein that was initially identified based on the homology of its extracellular domain with CD95L ( 28 % identi - cal ) , TNF ( 23 % identical ) and LT a ( 23 % identical ) ( ref . 7 ) . TRAIL induces apoptosis in a wide variety of transformed cell lines , but does not seem to be cytotoxic to normal cells in vitro 7 – 10 . So far , four homologous human receptors for TRAIL have been identi - fied , including DR4 ( ref . 11 ) , DR5 / TRAIL - R2 / TRICK2 ( refs . 12 – 14 ) , TRID / DcR1 / TRAIL - R3 ( refs . 12 , 13 , 15 ) and TRAIL - R4 / DcR2 ( refs 16 , 17 ) , called TRAIL - R1 , - R2 , - R3 and - R4 , respec - tively , here . Both TRAIL - R1 and - R2 contain intracytoplasmic death domains and , on ligation in sensitive target cell lines , me - diate apoptosis in vitro . In contrast , neither TRAIL - R3 ( which is GPI linked 15 ) nor TRAIL - R4 ( which contains a truncated cyto - plasmic death domain 16 ) mediates cellular death . Northern blot analyses indicate that mRNA for TRAIL - R1 , R - 2 and - R4 are widely expressed 12 , 14 – 16 . The extracellular domains of all four re - ceptors are highly homologous and map to human 8p22 - 21 , in - dicating that they have arisen by gene duplication 15 , 16 . A relatively high proportion ( approximately two - thirds ) of tumor cell lines tested so far are sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of TRAIL in vitro 7 , 8 , indicating that TRAIL may prove to be a pow - erful cancer therapeutic . We therefore created a soluble form of TRAIL ( human , hu , and murine , mu ) in which trimer formation was promoted and stabilized by addition of a leucine zipper to the amino terminus . The purified recombinant proteins were used to determine their pharmacokinetic parameters , assess toxic side effects to normal tissue , and characterize the potential for TRAIL in the treatment of cancer in vivo . Generation of trimerized forms of human and murine TRAIL Although previous studies demonstrated that TRAIL could induce apoptosis of transformed target cells ( for example , Jurkat ) , the ac - tivity of a soluble form of TRAIL was enhanced by cross - linking monomers with an immobilized monoclonal antibody 7 . Previous studies clearly demonstrate the unusually promiscuous cytotoxic activity of both soluble and cell - surface forms of TRAIL against a wide variety of tumor lines and transformed cells 7 . The most com - mon soluble constructs of TRAIL ( or any recombinant TNF ligand family member ) express the C - terminal ~ 150 amino acids , con - taining the receptor binding site , and are normally epitope - tagged at the N terminus 7 , 9 . Although biological activity derives from the spontaneous oligomerization of the protomers that per - mit receptor cross - linking , further cross - linking these ligands with a monoclonal antibody often increases biological activity 7 , 18 . We therefore chose a soluble form of TRAIL in which the homol - ogy region of the ligand is N - terminally fused with a leucine zip - per motif 14 , which facilitates and stabilizes oligomerization through two independent sites 18 . The recombinant proteins were expressed in CHO cells , and SDS – PAGE analysis of the purified molecules indicated molecular weight of the protomer to be about 29 , 000 Da ( Fig . 1 a ) . The LZ - murine TRAIL protomer seemed to be slightly more heterogeneous in size compared to the Tumoricidal activity of tumor necrosis factor - related apoptosis - inducing ligand in vivo H ENNING W ALCZAK , R OBERT E .

Both were biologically active , induc - ing apoptosis of both human and murine target cells in vitro with similar specific activities . In contrast to the fulminant hepatotoxicity of LZ - huCD95L in vivo , administration of either LZ - huTRAIL or LZ - muTRAIL did not seem toxic to normal tissues of mice . Finally , repeated treat - ments with LZ - huTRAIL actively suppressed growth of the TRAIL - sensitive human mammary adenocarcinoma cell line MDA - 231 in CB . 17 ( SCID ) mice , and histologic examination of tu - mors from SCID mice treated with LZ - huTRAIL demonstrated clear areas of apoptotic necrosis within 9 – 12 hours of injection . © 1999 Nature America Inc . • http : / / medicine . nature . com © 1999 N a t u r e A m e r i ca I n c . • h tt p : / / m e d i c i n e . n a t u r e . c o m Fig . 2 Cross - species activity of LZ - huTRAIL and LZ - muTRAIL .

Size exclusion chromatography of puri - fied LZ - huTRAIL and LZ - muTRAIL indicated that they exist in solution as stable trimers of 89 , 000 ( Fig . 1 a ) and 82 , 000 Da ( not shown ) , respec - tively , and the LZ form was more ac - tive in lysis of huMDA - 231 mammary adenocarcinoma cells than was Flag - TRAIL , whether cross - linked or not ( Fig . 1 b ) . The magni - tude of differences in specific activity between Flag and LZ forms was very dependent on cell type . For example , unless cross - linked , Flag - TRAIL induced little cytotoxic activ - ity in Jurkat cells ( Fig . 1 c ) , a result that has also been reported by oth - ers 19 . Although the basis for this dif - ference is not known , the LZ form always showed greater cytotoxic activity than the Flag form , even when it was cross - linked by a Flag - specific antibody . Finally , we analyzed the pharmacokinetic parameters of LZ - huTRAIL in mice . Mice were injected intravenously with 10 m g of LZ - huTRAIL , and serum concentrations were determined at periodic intervals by a capture ELISA . A maximum serum concentration of 1 . 4 m g / ml was detected 5 minutes after injection ( the first time point assayed ) , and analysis of the data indicated an extended distribution half - life of 1 . 3 hours and an elimination half - life of 4 . 8 hours ( Fig . 1 d ) . The material detected using the ELISA proce - dure was determined to be biologically active in parallel bioassays ( data not shown ) . Cytotoxicity and toxicity profiles of LZ - huTRAIL The cytotoxic activities of LZ - huTRAIL and LZ - muTRAIL were also tested on human as well as murine tumor cell lines in vitro . Although the murine cell line LB27 . 4 was killed equally well by both LZ - huTRAIL and LZ - muTRAIL ( Fig . 2 a ) , LZ - huTRAIL was slightly ( approximately 300 % ) more active than LZ - muTRAIL on the human cell line Jurkat ( Fig . 2 b ) . Further analyses demon - strated that LZ - huTRAIL induces apoptosis of the human mam - mary adenocarcinoma MDA - 231 in a dose - dependent fashion , but not of normal mammary epithelial cells or cells from a vari - ety of other normal human tissues ( Fig . 3 ) . A salient exception was normal human astrocytes , which were highly sensitive to LZ - huTRAIL . A second consideration regarding TRAIL in the treatment of tu - mors in vivo is its potential toxic effects on normal tissues .

In addition , based on the results from the in vitro analysis of normal human cell lines ( Fig . 3 ) , we were con - cerned about potential toxicities to neural tissues in vivo . Thus , to test the potential in vivo effects of TRAIL , we administered LZ - muTRAIL , LZ - huTRAIL or , as a control , LZ - huCD95L to female B6 mice by intravenous injection . Injection of LZ - huTRAIL or LZ - muTRAIL did not result in any observable toxic effects , whereas mice that received 50 m g of LZ - huCD95L were moribund within 55 minutes . Histologic examination of tissues obtained 4 hours after injection of 200 m g of recombinant LZ - muTRAIL did not show any changes in the liver ( Fig . 4 a ) compared with tissue from mice injected with mouse serum albumin ( MSA ) ( Fig . 4 b ) , or in other tissues or organ systems examined , including brain ( data not shown ) . Nor were any changes detected in tissues obtained 24 hours after injection of LZ - huTRAIL or LZ - muTRAIL ( data not shown ) . In contrast , histologic examination of liver tissues ob - tained from mice injected with 50 m g LZ - huCD95L 55 minutes before necropsy showed massive hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis with hemorrhage ( Fig . 4 c ) . At necropsy , blood was col - lected into EDTA - coated tubes from mice treated with LZ - huTRAIL . A complete blood count and a differential count were determined on an automated hematology analyzer , evaluating 6 , 000 – 12 , 600 cells per mouse . All red blood cell and white blood cell parameters and indices were within the normal range for mice at 4 and 24 hours after LZ - muTRAIL or LZ - huTRAIL treat - ment , and in mice treated for 14 days with either MSA or LZ - huTRAIL ( data not shown ) . Rapid cardiovascular collapse prevented the collection and evaluation of blood from the mice treated with LZ - huCD95L . Intravenous injection of up to 500 m g of LZ - huTRAIL or 1 mg of LZ - muTRAIL , the highest doses of the respective molecules tested , also failed to induce any detectable deleterious effects in mice ( n = 3 ; data not shown ) . Histologic examination of tissues from BALB / c mice treated for longer periods of time ( 500 m g / day for 14 days ) has also shown no toxicity in a comprehen - sive screening of all organ systems . Anti - tumor activity of TRAIL in vivo To determine whether the tumoricidal activity of LZ - huTRAIL observed in vitro could be demonstrated in vivo , CB . 17 ( SCID ) mice were injected either in - traperitoneally or subcutaneously with 1 · 10 6 MDA - 231 cells followed by 10 days of twice daily intraperitoneal injections with either MSA in tris - buffered saline ( TBS ) , 100 m g LZ - huCD40L or LZ - huTRAIL in TBS . Of the mice challenged intraperitoneally with tumor cells , mice treated with MSA or LZ - huCD40L died from the tumor burden between days 32 and 49 after tumor cell injec - tion ( mean survival = 35 . 5 days in control mice and 35 days in mice treated with LZ - huCD40L ) . In contrast , mice treated with LZ - huTRAIL survived substantially longer ( mean survival = 69 days ; P = 0 . 0001 ) , and 25 % of the mice remained alive at the end of the experiment on day 90 ( Fig . 5 a ) . Growth of subcutaneous MDA - 231 tumor cells was also profoundly affected by TRAIL treatment compared with that in the control groups . Tumors in mice treated with either MSA or LZ - huCD40L initially grew fairly slowly , followed by exponential growth . In contrast , tumor growth in mice treated with LZ - huTRAIL was substantially sup - pressed compared with that in control mice , with no detectable tumor in five of the eight mice by week 2 ( Fig . 5 b ) . The ability of LZ - huTRAIL to mediate regression of subcutaneously implanted tumors was dose dependent , with obvious benefit being detected at 100 m g / day , and decreased beneficial effect at 50 m g / day , and little or no detectable effects noted at doses of 3 , 10 or 30 m g / day ( data not shown ) . However , some residual tumor cells remained in those mice , as detectable tumors began to re - emerge at weeks 4 and 5 . To determine whether the re - emerging tumors had be - come resistant to TRAIL - induced apoptosis , tumors from each treatment group were obtained , dissociated and tested for sensi - tivity to LZ - huTRAIL in vitro . Tumor cells from each of the treat - ment groups and parental tumor cells were equally sensitive to Fig . 4 Acute effect of systemic administration of LZ - huTRAIL , LZ - muTRAIL and LZ - huCD95L .

We did a second experiment to evaluate the potential effects of treating tumor - bearing mice with a higher dose of LZ - huTRAIL . CB . 17 ( SCID ) mice were injected subcutaneously with MDA - 231 tumor cells , followed by ten daily intraperitoneal or intravenous injections of LZ - huTRAIL ( 500 m g / day ) . All ten of the mice receiving LZ - huTRAIL by intraperitoneal injection and eight of ten mice receiving LZ - huTRAIL intravenously were free of detectable tumors at day 40 ( Fig . 6 a ) . To determine the effi - cacy of LZ - huTRAIL on pre - existing tumors , mice bearing MDA - 231 tumors that had been established for 1 , 5 or 10 days were treated with LZ - huTRAIL for 14 days ( 500 m g / day , intraperi - toneally ) . Decreases in tumor size were observed in all three groups after initiation of treatment with LZ - huTRAIL , compared with those in control mice ( P < 0 . 001 in all cases ; Fig . 6 b ) . However , only mice in which treatment began relatively soon after tumor challenge showed durable tumor remissions at the end of the 42 - day observation period . Similar results have been obtained with two human colon carcinomas , COLO - 205 and HCT - 15 ( Table ) . Histologic analysis of tumors from TRAIL - treated mice The data presented above clearly demonstrate that treatment of mice with LZ - huTRAIL has a profound effect on tumor growth in vivo . To determine whether treatment of tumor - bearing mice with LZ - huTRAIL led to histologically detectable changes , mice bearing 14 - day old tumors ( approximately 4 mm in diameter ) re - ceived a single injection of LZ - huTRAIL ( 500 m g ) or vehicle con - trol at a site distal to the tumor ( intraperitoneal injection ) . After 5 , 9 , 12 or 25 hours , tumors from each treatment group were ex - cised and evaluated . Within 5 hours , compared with those of control mice , tumors from mice treated with LZ - huTRAIL had an increase in cellular debris but a minimal increase in condensed cells , morphologically compatible with apoptosis ( apoptotic necrosis ) . Tumors obtained 9 hours after injection contained an increased number of apoptotic cells and a substantial associated decrease in the number of mitotic figures ; this was most salient 12 hours after treatment with LZ - huTRAIL ( Fig . 7 ) , and only very few mitotic figures were observed 25 hours after injection . Discussion TRAIL is one of the most recently identified members of the TNF family , and , as its name implies , is capable of inducing apopto - sis .

In each case , mice received a total of 14 daily injections of LZ - huTRAIL . The number of tumor - bearing an - imals / number challenged at the termination of the experiment is shown at NATURE MEDICINE • VOLUME 5 • NUMBER 2 • FEBRUARY 1999 161 ARTICLES ferent tumor cell lines in vitro , it was unclear whether this apop - tosis - inducing capacity would be maintained in vivo while mini - mizing systemic toxicity . We therefore developed highly active forms of recombinant human and murine TRAIL to test the ago - nistic properties of this cytokine in vivo . Given that the biologi - cally active forms of TNF , LT a , CD40L and CD95L are oligomers , principally trimers , we created leucine zipper forms of TRAIL to promote and stabilize trimer formation . The molecular weight of the protomer of LZ - huTRAIL ( 29 , 000 Da ) is in good agreement with both the size reported for Flag - huTRAIL ( about 28 , 000 Da ; ref . 7 ) and the predicted size of the LZ - huTRAIL protomer of 27 , 400 Da . Size exclusion chromatography of purified LZ - huTRAIL indicates it exists in solution as a 89 , 000 - Da ho - motrimer . The biologic activity of LZ - huTRAIL is somewhat greater than that seen with antibody - cross - linked Flag - huTRAIL , and superior to un - cross - linked Flag - huTRAIL . The data also demonstrate the cross - species activity of both LZ - huTRAIL and LZ - muTRAIL on both human and murine targets , consistent with the original study 7 . Finally , pharmacokinetic analysis of LZ - huTRAIL in vivo indicates good bioavailability of this molecule and further supports its potential utility in the treatment of can - cer in vivo . TNF has been shown to play an important part in septic shock , graft - versus - host disease and many autoimmune disor - ders , including rheumatoid arthritis 5 , 22 – 26 . TNF has also been shown to mediate activation - induced cell death of peripheral T cells in vitro 27 and to be cytotoxic to a variety of human and murine tumor cell lines 28 . Unfortunately , early studies with re - combinant TNF showed that severe toxicity after systemic ad - ministration would limit the applicability of this cytokine in cancer treatment 29 , 30 . CD95L is also involved in several impor - tant physiological and pathophysiological processes , such as ac - tivation - induced cell death 31 – 34 , T - cell cytotoxicity 35 , 36 , virus - and alcohol - induced hepatitis 37 , 38 , and immune privilege 39 – 43 , and has been shown to induce apoptosis in many malignant cell lines . Unfortunately , non - transformed cells , such as activated T cells and B cells or hepatocytes , are also susceptible to CD95 - mediated apoptosis 44 , 45 . Indeed , treatment of mice with CD95 agonists rapidly induces death as a result of fulminant apoptosis of hepatocytes 20 , 21 . A chief concern with the potential use of LZ - TRAIL in the treatment of tumors in vivo is potential undesirable toxicities . Given the results of our in vitro analysis of normal human cell lines , we were also concerned about the potential toxic effects of LZ - huTRAIL on neural tissues in vivo . However , the data here demonstrate that neither LZ - huTRAIL nor LZ - muTRAIL exerts any detectable toxic effects upon systemic administration . In a similar result , small amounts of Flag - tagged human TRAIL ( 12 . 5 m g ) were non - toxic in mice even when injected 10 minutes be - fore administration of 50 m g of a cross - linking Flag - specific anti - body 19 . The lack of observable effects on neural tissue in vivo could be due to the inability of TRAIL to cross the blood – brain barrier . Alternatively , it is also possible that the sensitivity of as - trocytes to LZ - huTRAIL does not reflect the in vivo situation and is due to the culture conditions required to propagate these cells Fig . 7 Histology of tumors from mice systemically treated with LZ - huTRAIL .

Whatever is true , the data obtained from the in vivo study clearly indicate that TRAIL is different from the other three potent apoptosis - inducing TNF family members , TNF , LT a and CD95L , two of which have been shown to exert serious toxic effects after systemic administration 20 , 21 , 29 , 30 . Given recently ob - tained results using TRAIL - sensitive and TRAIL - resistant tumor cell lines , it seems unlikely that the lack of cytotoxic effects of LZ - TRAIL on normal murine tissues is due to expression of ‘decoy’ receptors . Healthy normal cells may express intracellular regulators ( for example , FLICE ( caspase 8 ) - inhibitory proteins ) of the biochemical signaling pathway ( s ) that lead to cell death 8 . Osteoprotegerin is capable of binding TRAIL in vitro with high affinity 46 . However , although TRAIL is reported to block the anti - osteoclastic activity of osteoprotegerin in vitro 46 , no histologi - cally detectable changes in bone structure have been observed here in mice treated for 14 days ( 500 m g / day ) with LZ - huTRAIL . Perhaps the most salient aspect of LZ - huTRAIL is its ability to mediate its tumoricidal effects in vivo . The tumoricidal effect is associated with the induction of histologically observable apop - totic necrosis in distinct regions of the tumor within 12 hours of a single injection of LZ - huTRAIL . Repeated treatments with LZ - huTRAIL clearly result in elimination of tumor cells in vivo , as ev - idenced by the fact that there was significant prolongation in survival of mice that were challenged intraperitoneally with tumor cells , and that 25 % remained tumor - free after treatment with LZ - huTRAIL . Similarly , treatment of mice bearing subcuta - neously implanted tumors also results in tumor shrinkage , and in some cases complete cures . This seems to be due to direct , and not indirect , effects on the tumor cells , as treatment of mice bearing TRAIL - resistant tumors had no effect on tumor growth ( data not shown ) . Successful treatment of pre - existing tumors was also demonstrated , although , as might be expected , it seems to be more difficult as the size of the tumor before treatment ini - tiation increases . Because the greatest proportion of cells under - going apoptosis in tumors in vivo was observed 12 hours after injection with LZ - huTRAIL , more frequent injections may be more effective at mediating tumor regression of the larger pre - existing tumors in vivo . TRAIL can suppress tumor growth in vivo by a direct and spe - cific mechanism without affecting normal tissues . The evidence presented here shows that TRAIL demonstrates potent anti - tumor activity on systemic administration , yet it has none of the deleterious side effects of the other apoptosis - inducing family members such as TNF and CD95L . These data indicate that TRAIL - based tumor therapy may be used either alone or in com - bination with other therapeutic strategies in the treatment of human cancers in situ . Studies are now in progress to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of TRAIL in combination with conventional chemotherapies in the treatment of cancer in vivo . Methods Cell culture . All cell lines were originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC , Rockville , Maryland ) maintained in alpha - modi - fied MEM supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , penicillin , strepto - mycin and glutamine . The panel of normal human cells tested was obtained from Clonetics ( Walkersville , Maryland ) . The cell lines were main - tained in media recommended by the supplier , and all tests were done within two to four passages of a cell line’s arrival . Production and purification of LZ - huTRAIL , LZ - muTRAIL and LZ - huCD95L . The LZ - huTRAIL and LZ - huCD95L expression plasmids have been described 14 . The LZ - muTRAIL expression plasmid was constructed by exchanging the TNF homology domain of human TRAIL with the corre - sponding domain of murine TRAIL . LZ - huTRAIL and LZ - muTRAIL were puri - fied from supernatants of CHO cells stably transfected with expression plas - mids for either LZ - huTRAIL or LZ - muTRAIL , whereas LZ - huCD95L was purified from the supernatant of CV1 - EBNA cells that were transiently co - transfected with expression plasmids for LZ - huCD95L and dominant nega - tive Fas - associated DD protein ( FADD ) . Supernatants containing the recombinant ligands were diluted fivefold with 20 mM Tris buffer ( pH 8 . 5 ) before application to a Q - Sepharose column ( Pharmacia LKB , Uppsala , Sweden ) at a ratio of 1 ml supernatant per 0 . 3 ml bead volume . The flow - through was then passed over a Fractogel cation exchange column ( E M Separations , Gibbstown , New Jersey ) at a ratio of 1 / 0 . 06 ml ( volume / vol - ume ) , washed with five column volumes of buffer and eluted with a salt gra - dient of 0 – 1 . 0 M NaCl in 20 mM Tris buffer ( pH 8 . 5 ) . Fractions containing recombinant proteins were ‘pooled’ , dialyzed against Tris - buffered saline ( TBS ) , divided into aliquots and stored frozen at – 70 °C . Protein concentra - tions were determined by amino - acid analysis , and endotoxin content de - termined by limulus amebocyte lysate analysis . The endotoxin content of materials used in the studies described here were less than 9 pg / mg of re - combinant protein . Cell death assays . Cytotoxic activity was determined using either an overnight 51 Cr - release assay or a crystal violet assay . Percent specific 51 Cr - re - lease was calculated as 100 · [ ( E – M ) / ( NP – M ) ] , where E = c . p . m . released in the presence of various concentrations of TRAIL , M = c . p . m . released in the presence of medium alone , and NP = c . p . m . released in the presence of 1 % Nonidet - P40 . Spontaneous release of 51 Cr from target cells cultured in the presence of medium alone was generally in the range of 20 – 30 % . Results obtained using the crystal violet assay are presented as direct absorbances obtained without further reduction . Pharmacokinetic study design and analysis . Mice were injected either in - travenously or subcutaneously with 10 m g LZ - huTRAIL in a total volume of 150 m l . At various time points ranging from 5 min to 24 h after injection of LZ - huTRAIL , groups of mice ( three mice per group ) were bled by cardiac puncture and killed . Serum was isolated from the blood samples and the serum concentration of LZ - huTRAIL was determined using a capture ELISA specific for LZ - huTRAIL in which standard ( a known concentration of LZ - huTRAIL in mouse serum ) or serum sample was prepared in PBS + 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 ( PBST ) . Appropriate dilutions of standard or experimental sample were added to ELISA plates coated with huTRAIL ( M180 ) monoclonal anti - body , incubated for 1 h at room temperature , washed thoroughly with PBST and incubated with a leucine zipper - specific monoclonal antibody . After an additional 1 h incubation , the plates were again thoroughly washed with PBST and developed using donkey anti - sheep antiserum cou - pled to horseradish peroxidase followed by a TMB peroxidase ( Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories , Gaithersburg , Maryland ) substrate solution , ‘quenched’ with 1 M phosphoric acid , and optical density was determined at 450 nm on an ELISA plate reader . Serum concentrations of LZ - huTRAIL were deter - mined from the linear portion of the sample titration curves and were ex - pressed as the mean concentration ( ng / ml ) + s . e . m . The pharmacokinetic parameters of LZ - huTRAIL in blood were deter - mined from blood concentration / time profiles . The apparent elimination rate constant ( K ) and half - life were calculated using a pharmacokinetics half - life program on an RS / 1 system . The log linear portion of the blood ( or tissue ) concentration / time curve was used to calculate K with half - life deter - mined as half - life = In2 . Half - life values are presented as half - life + s . e . m . , where s . e . m . indicates the error in fitting the log linear line to the data points in calculating the K value . The distribution and elimination half - lives were calculated using a biphasic pharmacokinetics program that related the respective log linear concentration / time curves to specific K and half - life val - ues . The area under the blood concentration / time curve from T = 0 to infi - nite time was determined by conventional trapezoidal summation and extrapolation . The maximum serum concentration and the time of maxi - mum serum concentration were determined directly from the plotted data . Determination of in vivo toxicity of recombinant LZ molecules . Female C57Bl / 6 or BALB / c mice were injected once either intraperitoneally or intra - venously with a buffer containing recombinant ligand . After 4 or 24 h ( for LZ - huCD95L , after 55 min ) , mice were humanely killed by CO 2 inhalation . Evidence of toxicity was determined by examination of 35 – 38 tissue sec - © 1999 Nature America Inc . • http : / / medicine . nature . com © 1999 N a t u r e A m e r i ca I n c . • h tt p : / / m e d i c i n e . n a t u r e . c o m NATURE MEDICINE • VOLUME 5 • NUMBER 2 • FEBRUARY 1999 163 ARTICLES tions that represented a comprehensive screening of all organ systems ( lymphoid , skin , nervous , respiratory , digestive , endocrine , reproductive , musculoskeletal ) . Treatment of tumor - bearing mice with LZ - huTRAIL . Female CB . 17 ( SCID ) mice were pretreated 24 h before tumor challenge with a single in - jection ( 100 m l , intraperitoneally ) of purified asialo GM - 1 antibody . Mice were challenged with 1 · 10 6 MDA - 231 cells ( originally obtained from ATCC , Rockville , Maryland ) by intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection .
