J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 2 Abbreviations : COVID - 19 — coronavirus disease 19 CI — confidence interval PCR — polymerase chain reaction SARS - CoV - 2 — severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SD — standard deviation TP — time point J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 1 Abstract 1 Purpose The coronavirus disease 19 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic affects students in a myriad of 2 different ways . Our prospective , longitudinal study in a cohort of students in Hannover , 3 Germany explores behavioral patterns during escalating COVID - 19 restrictions . 4 Methods 777 students between the age of 9 and 20 were assessed for their activity 5 engagement , travel patterns and self - assessed compliance with protective recommendations at 6 six time points between June 2020 and June 2021 ( 3564 observations ) and were monitored for 7 SARS - CoV - 2 infection by nasal swab PCR and serum antibody titers . 8 Results Activity engagement decreased , but self - assessed compliance with measures such as 9 mask wearing and social distancing was stable during escalating restrictions . While we found 10 no sex difference during the summer break , when incidence was lowest , females engaged in a 11 higher variety of activities than males for all other time points . Older students engaged in 12 more activities and self - assigned themselves lower compliance values than younger ones . 13 Greater involvement in different activities was seen in households which traveled more 14 frequently . Infection rate in our cohort was low ( 0 . 03 % acute infections , 1 . 94 % positive sero - 15 prevalence ) . 16 Conclusion Our study supports the view that , overall , students show high compliance with 17 COVID - 19 recommendations and restrictions . The identification of subsets , such as female 18 and older students , with higher - risk behavioral patterns should be considered when 19 implementing public information campaigns . In light of the low infection rate in our cohort , 20 we conclude that in - person learning can occur safely if extensive protective measures are in 21 place and the incidence in the general population remains moderate . 22 Key words Adolescents ; COVID - 19 ; Behavior ; School ; Infections ; 23 24 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 2 Implications and Contribution 25 In this study we longitudinally assessed students’ behavior regarding activities , travel and 26 compliance with protective measures . Children and adolescents modify their behavior in 27 response to pandemic - related restrictions in an age and sex dependant manner . These patterns 28 are highly relevant for the implementation of effective infection control measures , including 29 public information campaigns . 30 Introduction 31 Germany introduced a series of restrictions in March and April of 2020 to combat the spread 32 of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) [ 1 ] . Restrictions were 33 deescalated in May and June of 2020 , but reinstated in November [ 2 ] . Children and 34 adolescents were affected by limitations regarding in - person learning , sports and leisure 35 activities and restrictions on social contacts [ 3 ] . The burden of coronavirus disease 19 36 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic on young people’s mental and physical health has been the subject of 37 intense study , yet the full impact remains uncertain [ 4 , 5 ] . 38 Much debate surrounds the dilemma that children are potential drivers of the pandemic , but 39 restrictions and school closures have a significant impact on their wellbeing [ 6 , 7 ] . Children 40 overwhelmingly experience mild or asymptomatic disease and are unlikely to be index cases 41 in household transmission [ 8 , 9 ] . Whether this is due to intrinsic biological mechanisms , 42 behavioral patterns or a combination of both remains unclear [ 8 , 10 ] . Adolescent behavior and 43 alleged non - compliance have been discussed as drivers of viral spread [ 11 ] and the role of in - 44 person learning in transmitting infection remains controversial [ 12 - 14 ] . 45 To explore children’s and adolescents’ behavioral patterns and their determinants during 46 escalating COVID - 19 restrictions , we conducted a longitudinal observational study in a 47 cohort of students attending in - person schooling in Hannover , Germany . 48 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 Methods 49 Study design 50 This prospective longitudinal cohort study was open to all students ( grades 5 to 13 ) attending 51 a secondary school in Hannover , Germany . Data were collected at six time points ( TP ) over 52 the course of one year ( June 2020 to June 2021 , with the initial TP before the summer break 53 ( TP0 ) and five follow - up TP ( TP1 - 5 ) in September , October , November , December and June 54 ( Fig . 1a ) . Detailed information about state - mandated COVID - 19 restrictions and school 55 opening levels are given in Suppl . Fig . 1 . Participants were tested on - site during school hours 56 and were asymptomatic at the time of testing . Students with symptoms of a respiratory tract 57 infection or with a “high risk contact” were not permitted on school grounds due to 58 Department of Education regulations . 59 The study was approved by the institutional review board ( No . 9085 _ BO _ S _ 2020 ) and 60 complies with the Declaration of Helsinki . Study participation was voluntary and informed 61 consent was obtained from participants and , in case of minors , their legal guardians . Study 62 entry or opt - out was possible at any time . 63 Data and sample collection 64 Pharyngeal swabs were collected at each TP , serum samples were collected at TP0 , TP1 , TP3 65 and TP5 . 66 A questionnaire assessing age , sex , history of COVID - 19 infection , smoking behavior , health 67 status and household size was handed out at study inclusion . At every follow - up TP , we 68 distributed a second , shorter questionnaire on everyday activities , travel and compliance with 69 COVID - 19 prevention recommendations . Participants were asked whether in the previous 30 70 days they had engaged in 23 pre - defined activities . Travel was defined as at least one 71 overnight stay outside a participant’s primary residence . Adherence to hand hygiene , social 72 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 distancing and mask usage were reported by the participants on a visual analogue scale 73 between 0 ( low ) and 10 ( high ) compliance . Participants ranked both their own and their 74 families’ compliance . 75 Laboratory testing 76 Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) tests for samples at TP0 , TP1 , TP2 , TP3 and TP5 were 77 performed using the protocol of Corman et al . [ 15 ] Ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) was isolated 78 immediately on - site in a mobile laboratory , and transported for further processing off - site . 79 The samples of TP4 and TP5 were processed using reverse transcriptase PCR Allplex™2019 - 80 nCoV assay ( Seegene ) according to manufacturer´s instructions . A cycle threshold of 40 or 81 below was considered positive . 82 Serum samples were aliquoted and stored by Hannover Unified Biobank within 3 hours of 83 collection . Sera were tested using the Elecsys® Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 ( Roche ) assay following 84 the manufacturer’s instruction . A cut - off index ≥ 1 . 0 was considered reactive . 85 In a second step , positive antibody samples were tested with a neutralization assay . The 86 samples were diluted at 1 : 25 , 1 : 100 , 1 : 400 and 1 : 600 . To this end , we used the vesicular 87 stomatitis virus ( VSV ) based SARS - CoV - 2 spike pseudotyping system recently described 88 [ 16 ] . 89 Statistical analysis 90 Data are given as mean and standard deviation ( SD ) , numbers ( n ) and percentages ( % ) or inter 91 quartile range ( IQR ) . Paired T - test was performed for self - assessed compliance and self - 92 assessed family member compliance . Multivariable linear mixed regression models were 93 employed for activity engagement , travel patterns , and self - assessed compliance with 94 protective measures , adjusted for time point of testing , age group and sex as fixed effects , 95 including participant ID as random effect to account for the inter - subject variation [ 17 ] . For 96 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 dichotomous endpoints , i . e . the types of activity such as meeting friends ( yes / no ) , we 97 performed a logistic regression for repeated measures including sex as fixed effect [ 18 ] . 98 Corrected means and confidence interval ( CI ) for the endpoints were obtained from the least - 99 square - means adjusted to the models . Multiple comparisons were adjusted with Sidak 100 correction . P - values < 0 . 05 were considered significant . Statistical analyses were performed 101 using SAS 9 . 4 ( SAS Institute Inc . , USA ) . 102 Results 103 Study population 104 A total of 779 students agreed to participate ( Suppl . Table 1 ) . Two students were excluded 105 because the collection of pharyngeal swabs failed due to excessive gagging . 72 . 3 % ( 777 of 106 1074 ) of students at the school participated in at least one time point , and 61 . 2 % ( 657 of 107 1074 ) gave at least one serum sample ( Suppl . Table 2 , Fig . 1b ) . Female students accounted for 108 46 . 5 % ( n = 361 ) of the study population . The mean age was 14 . 55 ( SD 2 . 57 ) years . Nine 109 percent reported active smoking within the last three months , mainly older students . Detailed 110 demographical data is shown in Suppl . Table 2 . Eleven percent reported having a chronic 111 disease , most commonly asthma and allergies ( 48 . 8 % ) ( Fig . 1c ) . Sixty percent ( n = 473 ) of 112 students had at least one college - educated adult in the household . 113 SARS - CoV - 2 infection rates and sero - prevalence 114 In June 2020 ( TP0 ) , COVID - 19 incidence in the region was low , with a 7 - day rolling 115 incidence of ~ 10 / 100 , 000 . Incidence rose over the course of the study , reaching ~ 130 / 100 , 000 116 by TP4 . Following an extensive period of lockdown with no in - person schooling in the winter 117 of 2020 / 2021 and the introduction of vaccines , incidence decreased , and had reached 118 ~ 40 / 100 , 000 by TP5 ( Fig . 1a ) . In response to infection rates , state mandated restrictions 119 changed multiple times ( Suppl . Fig . 1 ) . From April 2020 until the summer break , school re - 120 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 started with a combination of in - person and virtual learning . When school resumed after the 121 summer break , classes were in - person . From the beginning of 2021 , all lessons took place 122 virtually until May 2021 , when falling infection rates precipitated a return to an in - 123 person / virtual hybrid model . Whenever in - person schooling took place , mask - wearing and 124 hand - washing were implemented as well as measures to reduce the number of personal 125 contacts ( fixed cohorts , staggered breaks ) and frequent ventilation of class rooms ( but no air - 126 filtering ) ( Suppl . Fig . 1 ) . Under these conditions , out of 3564 collected pharyngeal swaps , only 127 one student tested positive ( 0 . 03 % ) . This occurred at TP3 ( Suppl . Table 1 ) . 128 We identified six students with a positive antibody titer at TP0 , reflecting the first wave of 129 infections in Germany ( Suppl . Table 1 , 3 ) . Neutralizing antibodies were detected in five of six 130 cases . There was no further seroconversion at TP1 or TP3 despite extensive travel over the 131 summer and in - person schooling in autumn . In TP5 , after a long period of homeschooling and 132 lockdown , seven students had seroconverted with neutralizing antibodies in 6 of 7 cases , 133 reflecting the third wave of infections in Germany . The overall sero - prevalence was therefore 134 1 . 94 % ( 13 of 667 ) . 135 Student behavior during COVID - 19 restrictions 136 We investigated the changes in behavioral patterns under varying levels of COVID - 19 137 restrictions by assessing the level of activity , travel patterns and self - assessed compliance 138 with protective recommendations . 139 Activity Engagement 140 The number of different activities performed by the students decreased with escalating 141 restrictions ( Table 1 , Fig . 2a ) . The lowest level of engagement was seen at TP4 , during 142 lockdown , with a decrease on average five activities from TP1 ( Table 1 : linear mixed 143 regression model , ß ( TP4 ) = - 4 . 7 ; p < 0 . 001 ) . Female students engaged in a higher variety of 144 activities than males , except at TP1 ( Table 1 , Fig . 2b ) ; this was confirmed in a mixed model 145 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 using an interaction term between sex and TP ( data not shown ) . Adolescents showed a 146 significantly higher number of different activities when compared to younger students ( age 147 group 9 - 12 years ) ( Table 1 , Fig . 2c ) . Escalating state - mandated restrictions from December 148 2020 on prohibited most leisure activities ( e . g . sports , music lessons ) and restaurants , retail 149 stores and cultural institutions stayed closed for several months ( Suppl . Fig . 1 ) . For activities 150 which were not permitted at TP4 and / or TP5 due to stricter state - mandated restrictions , the 151 age and sex differences disappeared . It is important to note that significant reductions 152 occurred even in activities that continued to be permitted under the stricter COVID - 19 153 measures at TP4 and TP5 , such as grocery shopping , the use of public transit and ( limited ) 154 private gatherings , reflecting voluntary behavior ( Fig . 2d ) . Meeting other people , e . g . , friends 155 and family , was common at all TPs , with adolescents seeing friends more frequently than 156 younger children . Notably , private gatherings were limited by law as infection rates rose ; in 157 summer 2020 gatherings of two households were allowed , but this was reduced to one 158 household plus one person in January / February 2021 ( Suppl . Fig . 1 ) . Furthermore , shopping 159 of any kind was more common in female and older students ( Suppl . Table 4 ) . Females were 160 more likely to go to a café or ( movie - ) theater and use local public transit , whereas males 161 were more likely to have visited the gym , a lake or a professional sporting event . For most 162 individual categories , adolescents engaged in more activities than children ; only “going to the 163 swimming pool” and “attending music lessons” were more common in the younger age group 164 ( Suppl . Table 4 ) . The proportion of indoor activity increased continuously from TP0 48 . 9 % 165 ( n = 2778 ) to TP4 68 . 0 % ( n = 1628 ) while activities that were exclusively outdoors decreased 166 from 24 . 2 % ( n = 1375 ) to 7 . 3 % ( n = 174 ) . Between TP4 and TP5 , as spring approached , this 167 trend was reversed . 168 Travel patterns 169 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 Fewer students travelled during the autumn break than during the summer break ( 50 . 8 % vs . 170 85 . 5 % . During both these periods , touristic overnight stays were permitted without 171 restrictions ( Fig . 3a , Suppl . Fig . 1 ) . Travelling was rare for Christmas break ( 0 . 9 % ) and Easter 172 break ( 7 . 9 % ) , when touristic overnight stays were forbidden due to high COVID - 19 incidence 173 ( Fig . 3a , Suppl . Fig . 1 ) . The average number of trips per student also decreased . In summer , 174 52 . 4 % ( n = 285 ) of travelers took two trips or more , versus 16 . 1 % ( n = 54 ) in autumn . During 175 the summer break , 39 . 4 % ( n = 213 ) of traveling students remained within Germany , 29 . 5 % 176 ( n = 159 ) traveled outside of Germany but within Europe , 29 . 6 % ( n = 160 ) both in Europe and 177 Germany , and 1 . 5 % ( n = 8 ) outside Europe . During the autumn break , fewer students traveled 178 and those that did overwhelmingly remained within Germany ( 83 . 1 % , n = 271 ) . Notably , most 179 trips were local , with 12 . 3 % ( n = 131 ) of all trips in summer and 21 . 7 % ( n = 107 ) in autumn 180 within Northern Germany ( Fig . 3b ) . Most trips were undertaken by car , and holiday rentals 181 were the most popular accommodation during school breaks , both for trips in - and outside 182 Germany ( Suppl . Fig . 2 ) . Students who travelled regularly had higher everyday activity levels 183 both during school breaks and when school was in session . Students who travelled more than 184 twice or travelled during autumn break , when the incidence was already rising , also displayed 185 a higher activity engagement while at home , possibly indicating a higher risk - tolerance 186 overall ( Fig . 3c , d ) . 187 Compliance with protective recommendations 188 We measured the self - assessed compliance with COVID - 19 protective recommendations 189 including social distancing , mask wearing and hand hygiene on a visual analogue scale 190 between 0 - 10 . The interquartile range ( IQR ) was between seven and eight for all TPs ( Fig . 191 4a ) . There was no sex difference , but adolescents assigned themselves lower values for 192 compliance than children ( Fig . 4b ) . Students assessed their families with higher compliance 193 levels than they awarded themselves ( mean difference 0 . 6 , 95 % CI 0 . 5 to 0 . 70 ) . Students who 194 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 assessed their own compliance with lower values were more likely to display higher activity 195 levels . ( Fig . 4c ) . 196 Factors influencing behavior 197 We performed a mixed model analysis comprising activity engagement , travel and self - 198 assessed compliance to identify factors that influence students’ behavioral patterns , or 199 predispose certain groups to more cautious behavior ( Suppl . Table 5 ) . Presence or absence of 200 a chronic disease did not influence any of the behavioral parameters we measured , nor did we 201 find differences for specific illnesses such as asthma ( Suppl . Fig . 3 ) . To explore the influence 202 of parental education on students’ behavior , we analyzed the profession of adults living in the 203 same household , presumably parents or guardians . Households with two or more college - 204 educated adults travelled more frequently , but did slightly less activities than those with one 205 or no college - educated adult . However , we observed no further association between adults’ 206 profession or educational level and students’ everyday activities or self - assessed compliance 207 ( Suppl . Fig . 4 ) . Our cohort included a large proportion of households with adults working in 208 the healthcare industry ( 16 . 5 % one adult and 6 . 8 % two adults in the household ) . Interestingly , 209 the health care worker status of adults did not affect students’ behavior in any of the examined 210 metrics ( Suppl . Fig . 4 ) . Similarly , household size , which ranged from 1 to 10 persons ( mean 211 4 . 06 , SD 1 . 07 ) did not affect behavioral patterns . 212 Discussion 213 This longitudinal study examined activity engagement , travel patterns and self - assessed 214 compliance with protective measures in students under escalating , state - mandated COVID - 19 215 restrictions . In the first 7 - month period in - person schooling was possible , while instruction 216 occurred purely online for 4 1 / 2 months between January and May . Behavioral patterns , 217 including leisure activities , protective measures and travel are known to be important factors 218 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 in determining viral spread [ 19 - 21 ] . Notably , we found significant voluntary behavioral 219 changes in our cohort : even activities that were permitted under stricter COVID - 19 measures 220 underwent a significant reduction . While overall activity engagement decreased , individual 221 behavioral patterns remained consistent under increasing restrictions . For example , while all 222 groups reduced their activity level significantly under restrictions , students with higher 223 activity levels under loose restrictions continued to belong to the higher activity group under 224 lockdown . Our study supports the view that most students are compliant with restrictions [ 11 , 225 22 , 23 ] , but identifies subsets with higher - risk behavioral patterns regarding COVID - 19 . 226 Behavioral patterns differed by sex and age . While self - assessed compliance did not differ 227 between the sexes , females overall engaged in a larger number of different activities than 228 males . Our study did not investigate the underlying causes of behavior . However , we 229 speculate that several factors could be responsible for the observed sex difference in activity 230 engagement . Firstly , societal gender norms may cause female adolescents to help with 231 household tasks such as grocery shopping more often than their male counterparts . 232 Alternatively , a higher index of social interaction and reliance on social support while under 233 stress may cause woman and girls to maintain contact with their social groups more than men 234 and boys [ 24 ] . It is relevant to note that the selection of activities was based on the risk of 235 transmission and is skewed towards activities with higher levels of social interaction . These 236 differences may therefore partly reflect that adolescent males engage in more solitary leisure 237 time [ 25 ] . Moreover , activites predominantly performed by male students , such as visitng the 238 gym or professional sporting events , were prohibited by the COVID - 19 measures ( Suppl . 239 Fig . 1 ) . Whereas activites that female students reported engaging in ( shopping , use of local 240 public transit ) were restricted , but not forbidden ( Suppl . Fig . 1 ) . Another possibility is 241 differential risk awareness regarding COVID - 19 , as previous studies highlight the importance 242 of self - perceived risk and the desire to protect others as important motivational factors for 243 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 compliance [ 26 , 27 ] . Further research exploring the psychological and societal phenomena 244 underlying sex differences in activity engagement by adolescents is merited . 245 In addition to sex , behavioral patterns differed by age group . Older students engaged in a 246 wider variety of activities than younger ones , and self - assigned themselves lower compliance 247 values . This is consistent with Hommes et al . , who report that infection precautions were 248 followed more frequently by primary school students than adolescents , despite higher risk 249 perception in the latter group [ 28 ] . Surprisingly , we did not find any differences for factors 250 commonly associated with a higher risk perception . Presence or absence of chronic disease 251 did not correlate with a particular behavior in our cohort . Similarly , students living with an 252 adult health care worker did not behave differently from those without family members in a 253 health care profession . 254 While we identified isolated cases of restriction - flaunting behavior , including 65 individuals 255 ( out of 777 ) who reported attending a party after restrictions forbidding such gatherings were 256 implemented , overall behavior modification in response to restrictions was high . This 257 suggests that escalating restrictions effectively modified the behavior of children and 258 adolescents , refuting claims that adolescents engage in widespread non - compliance with 259 COVID - 19 restrictions [ 29 ] . 260 The role of in - person schooling in driving viral spread remains controversial [ 6 , 7 , 19 ] . 261 Contrary to our expectations , infection rates in our cohort were low . We detected only one 262 asymptomatically positive student during in - person instruction . It is interesting to note that 263 seven of the thirteen students that seroconverted during the course of our study did so between 264 TP4 and TP5 , a period during which no in - person schooling took place , but community 265 incidence was high . This is consistent with previous German reports showing that in - school 266 transmission is limited , more common in older children , and correlates closely with overall 267 community transmission [ 30 ] . School - specific measures such as half - sized classes , fixed 268 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 cohorts and staggered breaks to reduce contacts as well as frequent ventilation of classrooms 269 ( Suppl . Fig . 1 ) , may explain the low infection rate we observed . The one PCR positive 270 student’s case occurred during a period of increased community infections , underlining the 271 relationship between school and community in viral spread . In England , the risk of an 272 outbreak in an educational setting grew by 72 % for every five cases per 100 , 000 increase in 273 the community incidence [ 31 ] . At the start of our study period , community transmission was 274 very low , with an average 7 - day rolling incidence of 9 cases per 100 , 000 inhabitants . Not a 275 single participant in our cohort seroconverted over the summer holidays even though 85 . 4 % 276 reported taking at least one trip , amounting to more than 930 trips taken overall . While 277 traveling was permitted in Europe during the summer due to low infection rates , some 278 evidence suggests that this extensive travel may have driven the second wave of infections in 279 autumn [ 32 ] . As testing rates increased simultaneously with the increase in travel activity , the 280 effect of these disparate factors on the rising infection rate remains uncertain [ 33 ] . Notably , 281 many participants of our study travelled by car , stayed in holiday rentals and remained 282 relatively close to home These travel choices were likely associated with a lower rate of social 283 contacts and therefore lower infection risk and may explain the lack of seroconversion [ 34 , 284 35 ] . We do not have data on the pre - pandemic travel behavior of our study participants . 285 However , studies on tourism from before the pandemic indicate higher rates of air travel and 286 hotel usage , suggesting that families adjusted their plans in context of the pandemic [ 36 , 37 ] . 287 Certain limitations must be considered when interpreting our data . First , participation in our 288 study was voluntary , and participants received the results of their tests , potentially skewing 289 our cohort towards those with more concern about COVID - 19 . Secondly , factors besides the 290 pandemic influenced student behavior : cold weather in northern Europe during the autumn 291 and winter months largely preclude certain outdoor activities ( e . g . , “swimming in a lake , sea 292 or ocean” ) . Thirdly , our study focused on a single , large school in a relatively affluent 293 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 neighborhood , potentially limiting the transferability of our conclusions to other regions and 294 socioeconomic settings . Overall , it is difficult to gauge the generalizability of our findings in 295 Germany to the behaviour of teenagers in other countries , as cultural norms and the 296 politicization of pandemic - related protective measures may significantly affect behavioral 297 patterns . Notably , only the final time point ( TP5 ) , in June 2021 , occurred after the delta 298 variant gained predominance in Germany . The most recent data from Germany ' s national 299 Public Health Institute ( Robert Koch Institut , RKI ) shows higher in - school transmission rates 300 in the summer of 2021 than in the summer of 2020 , likely reflecting the predominance of this 301 highly contagious variant [ 38 ] . However , we observed consistent sex and age differences in 302 student behavior over the entire study period , independent of the community incidence or 303 predominant variant of the virus . 304 Conclusion 305 Behavioral patterns remained consistent under increasing restrictions with female students 306 engaging in a wider variety of activities than males ( except for the first time point , with the 307 lowest community - wide incidence ) and older students displaying higher activity levels and 308 lower self - assed compliances values than younger ones . This should be taken into account 309 when implementing infection control measures in schools . Overall , we found a low rate of 310 infection both by pharyngeal swap and antibody test , supporting the view of high compliance 311 with COVID - 19 restrictions and protective measures in our cohort . We also demonstrate that 312 state - mandated restrictions result in effective behavior modification in children and 313 adolescents , even in subsets previously displaying higher - risk behavior such as frequent 314 travel , high activity levels and low self - assessed compliance scores . Taken together , our data 315 suggests that in - person learning can occur safely if extensive protective measures are in place 316 and the incidence in the general population remains moderate . 317 318 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 14 References 319 [ 1 ] Measures by the Federal Government to contain the spread of the COVID - 19 pandemic and 320 address its impacts .
