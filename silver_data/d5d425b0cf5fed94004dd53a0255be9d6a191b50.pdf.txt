Sustainability requires attention to both the opportunities and chal - lenges associated with the building of food sharing groups engaged in the redistribution of food but also in developing a wider agenda which includes , for instance , the local production of food resources . In this paper , we argue for a better understanding of the different conceptions of ‘fairness’ which inform volunteer and guest prac - tice and in turn mediate community - building efforts . We examine the practices surrounding ‘SharingEvent’ and challenges faced to sustainability by the heterogenous , and sometimes contested , com - mitments of the people involved . We further consider how ICT provided opportunities for explicit examination of ideological dif - ferences concerning what ‘sharing’ might mean . Our findings show that community building is dependent on the negotiation of differ - ent values and purposes identified . We derive recommendations for action - oriented researchers ultimately concerned with systemic transformation .

Within HCI , research into Sustainable HCI ( SHCI ) and Human - Food - Interaction ( HFI ) [ 1 ] has developed in response . We have argued [ 31 ] that the technology - centric focus that currently predominates research within HFI [ 1 ] needs broad - ening to include more research on collaborative aspects , because sustainable food practices depend on emergent communal activity . We present a practice - based view exploring how food sharing can be organically supported and how community building can be sus - tained . Supporting cooperative food sharing practices , as we shall see , involve mitigating conflicts that arise when different notions of fairness come together . In this paper we aim to describe and analyze how sharing food is done in a specific context and how it is connected to other sus - tainable food practices . We show how ideological tensions to do with ‘fairness’ play out and suggest how the use of digital artifacts may , in time , resolve some of these tensions . The specific context is SharingEvent and SharingHut24 / 7 , local food sharing initiatives in Siegen ( Germany ) that are connected to the wider Foodsharing . de movement . Supporting sustainable food practices and community building here can mean rather more than simply giving out food , as we shall see . In examining the distinct ideologies and beliefs which inform practices around SharingEvent and SharingHut24 / 7 we sug - gest we can inform design spaces . Our action - oriented research suggests that the issue of ( re - ) distributional justice and community building is especially relevant . Our perspective aligns with Weber et al . [ 97 ] who advocate for “deep change” ( a catch - all term for transformation / transition ) in food systems in terms of “values , consumption and production practices , and policies that enable grassroots consultation and mo - bilization” . Taking into account local needs , grassroots movements shape the immediate context of daily life [ 42 ] , opening spaces for participation and contribution [ 48 , 60 ] . These movements are a source of innovation and have the power to mobilize the resources needed for change towards sustainability [ 35 , 87 , 92 ] and “encour - age and engage [ . . . ] consumers and small producers in adopting unconventional practices for food production and consumption” [ 97 ] . Although the importance of grassroots movements in the shift toward sustainable practices is well known [ 87 , 97 ] , there is space CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Philip Engelbutzeder et al . to address the diversity of their practices and the different roles ICT can play [ 74 , 91 , 93 ] . Previous work , most notably that of Berns et al . [ 4 – 6 ] , has shown how a food surplus became a form of gift - giving , but not without some challenges . The moral implicature of this transformation was the cultivation of a food sharing community . Values like support - ing mutual relationships and commoning thus came to dominate within a group of volunteers . The importance of this lies in the idea of generalized reciprocity [ 83 ] , such that anyone can contribute and anyone can receive without the expectation of immediate and equivalent payback . For community building , however , an ideal sce - nario is that everyone can make some kind of contribution , though not necessarily in material kind . This turns out , in practice , not to be entirely unproblematic in that other normative principles , such as appropriate queuing behavior , also come into play . Indeed , we will argue that two broadly distinct views of fairness are vis - ible . The first is predicated on the allocation of scarce or surplus resources , and the second on a challenge to orthodox notions of giving and receiving aimed at encouraging local production rather than simply consumption . There are , we suggest , tensions between them . Below , then , we endeavor to answer the following research question : How can ICT support sustainable food practices in the context of a local community engaged in sharing rescued food in a normatively mediated , and contested , situation ? Our findings highlight issues such as stigma , social norms , proper conduct , fairness and lack of food literacy as challenges to com - munity building . At the same time , several community - oriented food practices , such as community gardening , emerge that can sup - port sustainable food practices . SharingEvent and SharingHut24 / 7 have played into the emergence of a community where common resources and knowledge are being shared and evolved . In the discussion , we derive five different notions of fairness : Charitable , Contribution - oriented , Equality - based , No - waste , and Systemic Fairness . We then discuss the negotiation of the conflict - ing notions of fairness and the role of action - oriented researchers therein . We propose that supporting the negotiation process is of paramount importance to build and sustain the community , in and through the development of its artifact ecology [ 9 , 10 ] . Our con - tribution to HCI , then , is an assessment of the role of ICT in the context of community building for food and food resource shar - ing , and the challenges faced as communities grow and different conceptions of fairness come into play . 2 RELATED WORK The paperdraws ontworelated strandsof HCIscholarship . Previous investigations into food production and consumption practices within SHCI provide a backdrop to situate our contribution . 2 . 1 Food in SHCI : From Individuals to Collectives In recent years , the topic of sustainable food production and con - sumption has burgeoned among HCI researchers [ 45 , 72 ] . Work in this space has investigated food practices as relevant sites for the design and evaluation of digital technologies . Internet technolo - gies are playing an important role in addressing more sustainable behaviors around food through an increasing number of mobile apps designed to reduce domestic waste [ 2 , 18 , 34 ] , or to encourage people to reflect on their everyday grocery shopping from social and ecological perspectives [ 94 , 95 ] . However , many HCI scholars appear to have shifted focus from systems designed for individ - uals to more collective approaches . For instance , departing from the highly individualized persuasive design approach , research has highlighted how ICT can support the co - evolution of more sus - tainable eating practices [ 57 ] , or how community food initiatives employ socio - technical innovations to support the creation of urban food commons [ 69 , 70 ] . Moreover , numerous research papers [ 18 , 26 , 39 , 72 , 76 , 88 , 89 , 96 ] suggest a need for a practice - based approach to SHCI research which centers cooperative practices . For instance , work by Silber - man et al . [ 88 ] highlights how technological innovation in HCI can often collide with sustainability goals , but argue that engagement with sustainable practices such as “collaborative consumption” and “do - it - yourself activities” , can enable both goals to co - exist by sup - porting social movements and promoting of civic engagement . The authors promote methods such as action research and participatory involvement as useful to achieve these goals . To give a concrete example from a similar domain , Strengers [ 89 ] conducted a study on the potential impact of eco - feedback systems for individual behavioral optimization by giving users feedback on their water and energy use . The results identified weaknesses in the impact of such systems and concluded that , for sustainable practices to be achieved in the long term , it is necessary to understand how and why certain resources are used and in what context the practices around them are embedded . The mere information disclosure of eco - feedback systems does not necessarily lead to sustainable prac - tices [ 89 ] . Brynjarsdóttir et al . [ 14 ] similarly emphasize the need to include the context in which sociocultural practices take place to effectively address sustainability challenges . Arguing that , per - suasive eco - feedback approaches are , in themselves , problematic without an underlying understanding of people . In contrast , the concept of ‘connected sustainability’ [ 74 ] em - phasizes a focus on community . Here the authors explore the role of digital technologies in supporting collective action by investi - gating grassroots movements and communities that share a strong sustainability agenda and the desire for political , economic and societal change . Examples include tools that build and maintain so - cial networks , that connect individuals with their communities and others with similar goals , or tools to help communities to maintain and extend their practices and connections . In such contexts , HCI scholars argue that digital technology should be appropriated as an infrastructure to support social interactions , rather than as a solution in itself [ 58 , 85 ] . Le Dantec defines infrastructures as “the integration of social and technical resources through a network of [ reconfigurable ] attachments” [ 58 ] . This is echoed in recent scholarship [ 54 ] which outlines how flexible digital infrastructures allow community initiatives prolif - erate by replicating the same ideas in new ways across different contexts . Relatedly , Knowles et al . [ 52 ] draw linkages between SHCI research and the concept of a sustainable future while criticizing individualism in SHCI [ 53 ] . The authors identify two dominant approaches within SHCI research : ( 1 ) sustainability through in - cremental change and ( 2 ) sustainability through systemic change . They argue that more radical concepts are needed and present ways ( Re - ) Distributional Food Justice : Negotiating conflicting views of fairness within a local grassroots community CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany in which SHCI can contribute to sustainability . For instance , they suggest that SHCI can also make a contribution in the area of citizen participation and enable coordination among citizen actors [ 53 ] . Clear et al . suggest that in HCI , people need to be involved in a cultural shift around food consumption [ 17 ] . They say , “ [ o ] nly by making the sustainable easier , more acceptable , more ‘normal’ , [ can we ] achieve a large - scale transition toward sustainable diets” [ 17 ] . Currently , large food operations dominate the market . Alternative models of supply need to be considered for sustainable practices ( e . g . , alternative local food economies [ 77 ] ) . Furthermore , HCI can assist in the design of citizen platforms that address local food con - sumption or promote urban communities that grow food [ 17 ] . In connection to this , research has increasingly emphasized the syn - ergetic interrelations between consumption and production , often referred to as prosumption practices [ 79 ] . In recent years , research has progressively aimed to understand and support prosumers [ 79 ] , who act in both consumptive and productive capacities , for instance , in the context of food [ 66 , 68 ] and energy [ 43 , 67 ] . To summarize , past work has unpacked the role of digital tech - nologies in creating more sustainable behavior and practices around food from waste management applications designed for individual use in the home , to more distributed systems that connect and mobilize grassroots and activist collectives , and support practices of ‘prosumption’ . Moreover , a shift in focus from designing for individual behaviors to collective practices was identified where researchers widened their remit to capture the contextual and re - lational complexities of food practice sustainability . Our research is situated at the intersection of SHCI and HFI looking into sus - tainable human - food practices , and identifies the challenges that need to be met ( see chapter 3 ) if we are to encourage more just food systems [ 97 ] . Therefore , in this paper we build on the existing literature by unpacking processes of ( re - ) distributional justice in relation to community building . 2 . 2 Food Sharing in HCI The desire for resilient communities , where residents produce their own food rather than depending on industrial food production , is growing [ 29 ] . Similarly , issues such as food waste and biodiversity are becoming ever more significant . As a result of this ( and reflect - ing the aforementioned interest in more collective approaches to food system sustainability ) , many grassroots movements are pop - ping up around the world [ 29 ] . A number of recent studies have unpacked the sociotechnical practices of such movements in dif - ferent forms , for example , web - based food networks [ 77 ] , digitally mediated seed sharing [ 48 ] , IoT systems to support urban foraging [ 26 ] , systems to deliver food resources to people in need [ 28 ] , on - line urban gardening networks [ 31 ] , and food sharing initiatives that ( re - ) distribute surplus food within their local communities [ 5 , 16 , 41 ] . The practice of food sharing has been investigated as part of the sharing economy encompassing a variety of collaborative consump - tion models [ 33 ] . A recent paper by Michelini et al . [ 65 ] identified three emerging models of food sharing : for profit , for charity , and for community . However , even within these models the motiva - tions and sociotechnical configurations of initiatives vary . Many initiatives are centered around ecological concerns such as reduc - ing waste or biodiversity , or social factors , such as strengthening a community or addressing problems of food insecurity . A large proportion of initiatives are non - profit [ 23 ] , and within those non - profit initiatives many focus on the redistribution of food products to those in need [ 25 ] . Regardless of the model , food sharing as a practice is undertaken for and with others , reshaping relations with both human and non - human entities , and with tangible ( e . g . , food ) and intangible ( e . g . , knowledge ) resources [ 29 ] . Such bottom - up approaches to food ( re - ) distribution have the potential to give those involved more agency and to be seen as food citizens instead of mere consumers [ 77 ] . Related work by Berns et al . [ 4 – 6 ] investigates the complexities associated with sharing surplus food within a local community economy and illustrates collaborative practices that can transform how we perceive and value food . For example , the authors argue that through collective practice of community volunteers collect - ing surplus food , sorting it , and sharing it , food that would have otherwise gone to waste is re - invested and transformed from being a commodity to a gift [ 4 ] . Building on this , later work by the same authors [ 5 ] explores queuing as a central practice of sharing food in that it demonstrates how the community deals with the practical issue of managing the flow of attendees while also speaking to how core values such as fairness and activism are organized . The authors go on to investigate design spaces for alternative queuing mechanisms at face - to - face food sharing events , exploring the role digital technologies and values can play in re - framing meanings usually associated with queuing . This avoids polarized narratives of efficiency versus socially - centered views of sociotechnical queuing practices [ 6 ] . Relatedly , a study by Landwehr et al . [ 56 ] , investigated the use of ICT for the distribution of food according to community values in the context of community supported agriculture , framing it as the mediation between consumers’ wishes and the constraints of local agricultural production . Grassroots communities , such as food sharing initiatives , are good examples of how people self - govern to address diverse con - cerns and the above work highlights how social change in food sharing can be built with the use of socio - ecological technologies . Yet , the members of grassroots communities rarely participate in the design of the tools they use and some argue that positioning designers as “in charge” of design processes is inherently prob - lematic and unjust [ 19 ] . This resonates with the work of Manzini and Coad [ 62 ] , that calls for the ‘expert’ designer to recognize and utilize the design expertise that grassroots initiatives already enact through what they call “diffuse design” - meeting the innate creativ - ity and design capacity human beings have when confronted with new problems . However , it must be noted that technology can only support activist movements if enough people use it . This is one of the reasons why Facebook is widely used by grassroots solidar - ity and activist movements ( see [ 41 ] and [ 4 ] for example ) . Widely used mainstream technologies such as social media ( in our case : Telegram ) provide templates for participation that are broadly and readily available , and easily adopted despite being one of the prime agents credited with undermining democracy [ 55 , 82 ] . Collabora - tive engagement and social networks are particularly conducive to this , it is suggested [ 23 ] . It is common for platforms such as Facebook and Telegram to simply be used as a means of organizing later face - to - face food and food resource sharing events ( see [ 5 ] and [ 31 ] for example ) . A major initiative which depends heavily CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Philip Engelbutzeder et al . on ICT is that of Foodsharing . de , a German - speaking movement [ 80 , 84 ] that is supported by a bespoke platform ( Foodsharing . de ) , as well as a Facebook page [ 40 ] . The platform supports publicly accessible ( re - ) distribution sites ( like SharingHut24 / 7 ) , peer - to - peer food sharing ( Foodsharer ) , as well as food saving ( Foodsaver ) , and had over 512 , 000 registered users as of September 2022 . Past work has investigated the motivations and sociotechnical practices of various types of food sharing initiative across different contexts and locations . Moreover , existing work in this space has highlighted how the use of digital technologies are interwoven with community practices , sometimes reflecting the values of members and sometimes in tension with these values . Our work connects to research on the social aspects of food sharing , especially on sharing surplus food as a communal activity . Building on similar distri - butional challenges identified in other food sharing communities , our work refines this by developing a clear framework with which fairness can be understood and by exploring opportunities that ICT might provide for negotiating fairness and food sharing events , and by exploring community building through generalized reciprocity [ 83 ] . 3 METHOD 3 . 1 Authors’ Positioning The project has thus far involved 28 months of research ( 22 months for AuthorOne , 12 months for AuthorTwo ) , using a practice - based [ 98 ] and action - oriented research approach [ 47 ] . AuthorThree and AuthorFour have conducted research in closely related communi - ties and have contributed extensively to our mutual understanding of the evolving nature of what communal resources might be . The research involved active and ongoing collaboration with the com - munity and was conducted in order to iteratively develop “collabo - rative activist - community interventions” [ 46 ] . Action research is suitable for research “with people experiencing real problems in their everyday lives” [ 46 ] . The action - oriented approach aims to generate “local solutions to local problems” [ 46 ] and allows us to think carefully about the roles of ICT in the context of a local com - munity where ( re - ) distributional justice is contested . As Funtowicz and Ravetz put it , post - normal science is a “ [ . . . ] problem - solving strategy that is used in the case of uncertain facts , controversial values , questions of great importance and an urgent need for action” [ 38 ] . Scientists involved explicitly give up fictions of objectivity during their activist engagement , and , in an integrated social pro - cess , ensure the quality of their findings through a community of experts drawn from civil society [ 20 ] . In this way , extended facts and an extended spectrum of knowledge and values provide con - textualized solutions , whose emphasis is less on generalizability and more on transferability . Because of its democratic and collab - orative approach , it is particularly relevant for us as activists and researchers and supports answering our research question : “How can ICT support sustainable food practices in the context of a local community engaged in sharing rescued food in a normatively me - diated , and contested , situation ? ” . In order to answer it , our aim is , on the one hand , to investigate the materiality of current practice in the food sharing group and how it is established by the habitus , discourses , artifacts , and use of space by participants [ 49 ] . On the other hand , AuthorOne and AuthorTwo see themselves as food ac - tivists , who are committed to the transformation of food practices towards sustainability , both locally and globally . Both have been actively involved in the German Foodsharing movement for over eight years and currently support a local Foodsharing community ( with AuthorOne having close connections to the designers and developers of the Foodsharing . de platform and AuthorTwo being a representative and leading Foodsharing Siegen with two other Am - bassadors ) . Their day - to - day commitments within the initiatives of SharingEvent and SharingHut24 / 7 include taking up responsibili - ties for coordination and organization ( like scheduling , moderating or taking the minutes of a meeting ) . Both were actively involved in all interconnected practices ( see chapter 5 . 3 ) . The volunteers were continuously kept informed that AuthorOne and AuthorTwo were collecting and analyzing data . In addition , with the Homeland Association and the local university , they established a living - lab ( see e . g . , [ 86 ] ) for research on sustainability in a local context . 3 . 2 Data Collection and Analysis Our qualitative data includes informal conversations and field notes that were written up by AuthorOne and Author Two during and at the end of each session in which they were active participants . Like - wise , a survey and brainstorming session were conducted during a SharingEvent about six months into the project . The nine semi - structured interviews with 15 participants were taken in months 8 - 9 and lasted between 18 minutes and 2 . 5 hours with an average time of 64 minutes ( see Table 1 ) . The focus there was on opportuni - ties and challenges involved in potential development . Similarly , the roles of ICT were a central theme of the interviews . Interviews were also conducted with Foodsharing Ambassadors from another city ( Giessen ) to provide points of comparison . Semi - structured interviews offer the possibility to generate reliable , comprehensi - ble and goal - oriented information and insights whilst allowing for flexibility [ 13 ] . Participant observation was another component of this research . This allows researchers to engage with people and objects already involved in the practices [ 8 ] . The interviews and field notes were coded and analyzed with Braun and Clarke’s thematic analysis [ 12 ] . After the initial data collection , analysis began and new research data were collected iteratively . AuthorOne and AuthorTwo orga - nized two hybrid workshops on the theme of ( re - ) distributional justice for the SharingEvent with twelve participants who were encouraged to write down notes on why they participated in or - ganizing the SharingEvent , collectively cluster them into themes and discuss them together . Both authors also participated in nu - merous organizational meetings taking place offline , online and in hybrid form ( e . g . , in the communal garden , via Zoom or the Organizational Team’s Telegram group ) and had access to PAD ( a web - based collaborative real - time editor ) material . According to the action - research approach we followed “cycles of inquiry that include planning , action , and reflection , in which the action being undertaken is continually designed and evaluated with research results emerging throughout these cycles” [ 46 ] . Thereby themes were generated from the codes and iteratively became more evi - dent to subsequently derive into design spaces . Here , the question of who gets what , why and when and corresponding negotiation ( Re - ) Distributional Food Justice : Negotiating conflicting views of fairness within a local grassroots community CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Table 1 : Interviews and participants Interview Participants Role Duration ( Hours ) # 1 1 & 2 Administrative Worker at the Homeland - Association ; Chairman of the Homeland - Association 0 : 18 # 2 3 & 4 Volunteers of the SharingEvent 0 : 28 # 3 3 - 8 Volunteers of the SharingEvent 1 : 21 # 4 9 - 12 Foodsharing - Ambassador in different city 2 : 36 # 5 7 Volunteers of the SharingEvent 1 : 48 # 6 13 Guest of the SharingEvent 0 : 31 # 7 14 Volunteers of the SharingEvent 1 : 11 # 8 1 Administrative Worker at the Homeland - Association 0 : 24 # 9 15 Guest of the SharingEvent 0 : 38 processes between the helpers and also other participants , such as the guests , came to the fore , which led us as researchers to work on conceptualizing ( Re - ) distributional Justice together with the community . All quotes below have been translated into English from German . 4 CONTEXT In March 2020 , the Covid - 19 pandemic led to a temporary closure of local food banks . Food banks here typically responded to need by providing low - cost food to those who can demonstrate that they were in need . The loss of low - cost food posed a major problem for many citizens who had previously taken advantage of the food bank’s services . As a consequence , the ‘Homeland - Association’ , a club devoted to the maintenance of local traditions and asso - ciated with different charitable projects , started temporary food ( re - ) distribution in a garage . AuthorOne became involved in the project early on , approaching the Homeland - Association and of - fering his support and subsequently assisting in the work . Food had typically been obtained through donation and through the ( sympathetic ) supermarket next door , which had a policy of giving away surplus food to the Homeland - Association . The Homeland - Association had then provided food at certain times each day . The main issue then was to coordinate ( re - ) distribution of the food and some problems arose . The first people to arrive usually took several big bags of food , so there was not always enough left for others . Sub - sequently the newly formed association , ‘Solidary Neighborhood Help’ ( SoliNa ) , who had started another food ( re - ) distribution center elsewhere in Siegen joined forces with the Homeland - Association . Every day , free food was given out to citizens without having to meet any poverty criteria . This involved both food donations and food rescued by Foodsharing from cooperating food businesses . In the meantime , and in addition , the volunteers had established an independent SharingHut24 / 7 ( local hut for food sharing that can be accessed by everybody right around the clock ) and a twice - weekly public ( re - ) distribution ( SharingEvent ) of rescued and other food ( resources ) in front of a social store ( where donated products are resold cheaply ) . The focus of this project , for the organizers , increasingly became sharing food with an eye to ( re - ) distributional justice . That is , towards some sense of equity and , more impor - tantly , community building . This dovetailed with other projects , such as the community garden of the Homeland - Association , which is only 20 meters away from the SharingEvent and SharingHut24 / 7 . Developing these nodes in a potential resource sharing network was a major ambition of the two main authors . 5 RESULTS : CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES Our findings revealed several features of the food sharing initiatives that had consequences for community building . These we analyze in relation to indigence , fairness , wider food - related practices , com - munity building , and the role of ICT . 5 . 1 Free Food linked to Indigence Moral judgments about the SharingEvents were commonplace . Helpers both in Siegen and in Giessen experienced judgment about entitlement or otherwise : “I’ve sometimes talked to people and they’ve said they don’t go there because they think their need is less . And then you always have to explain ‘we are left with a lot of food every time and then have to take it to the [ SharingHut24 / 7 ] again’ . ” ( Respondent 10 , Foodsharing Ambassador from Giessen ) SharingEvent is often perceived as a kind of food bank . The structure of the SharingEvent in Siegen perhaps reinforces this view since it takes place in front of or below a social store in a local area in which a lot of people live in precarious circumstances . Guests are not always aware that everyone is invited to participate in the project and it is explicitly linked to sustainable food practices . Respondent 7 describe this perception : “ [ . . . ] especially because then it is often said that we are the food bank . That’s how you notice that people first think that these are donations . ” ( Respondent 7 , helper at SharingEvent in Siegen ) The food redistribution of the food banks is closely connected with stigmatization and shame [ 30 , 51 , 73 ] : “I would like to be able to send my mother and say ‘what do you want to traipse to the weekly market again now , when you can look there first’ . Without that . . . it’s still a bit of ‘oh yes , but that’s also a bit embarrassing’ for everyone . ” ( Respondent 13 , guest at the SharingEvent in Siegen ) CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Philip Engelbutzeder et al . Making the ‘sharing’ goals and ideas behind SharingEvents and SharingHut24 / 7 understandable to outsiders was a challenge . Not least , as one volunteer said , “with people who are in need , com - munity is not the primary goal . ” ( field notes 21 / 06 / 2022 ) . Despite the emphasis on food rescue in promotional material , in both the Facebook and Telegram groups , inquiries were made about whether proof of need was necessary or how much the food costs . 5 . 2 Fairness in the Sharing of Food ( Waste ) The perception of fairness , or ‘justice’ came up again and again in the context of SharingEvent and SharingHut24 / 7 . Interestingly , such perceptions differed markedly . In both the Foodsharing cities of Siegen and Giessen guests and helpers had quite distinctive viewpoints . This was consequential when the organizers of the SharingEvents in both Siegen and Giessen decided to introduce rules for the SharingEvent in order to ( re - ) distribute food in a way that they saw as fair . The main principle behind the rules was that everyone who comes to the SharingEvent could take food with them . The reason for the introduction of the rules in Siegen was that guests who came first had taken so much that there was little left for those who arrived later : “ [ . . . ] our experience showed that the early arrivals filled up their bags . They probably did not eat or use all of that food and the others who were then later [ at the SharingHut24 / 7 ] then got nothing at all , so unfortunately that didn’t work at all . ” ( Respondent 3 , helper of the SharingEvent Siegen ) The introduction of rules evoked further challenges . This led to discussions about how fairness might be best conceived , and whether , for instance , size of family should be a consideration : “The justifications were often understandable : ‘I have four children ; I have five children at home’ . It is dif - ficult to say something against it , but on the other hand you have other people standing there who are also hungry . That was a real dilemma , it was diffi - cult . You knew you were doing the right thing , but it felt wrong . ” ( Respondent 3 , helper at SharingEvent Siegen ) Nevertheless , bearing in mind that an overarching goal of the Foodsharing movement is to prevent food waste , it was felt by some Foodsharing members that it does not matter who gets how much food as long as there is no waste . For the organization , that overrides other considerations : “The main goal of Foodsharing is to reduce the waste of precious resources on earth . [ . . . ] While implement - ing these goals , there can be the great side effect that the rescued food also supports those in need and pro - motes projects . Foodsharing , however , does not have as a goal to provide security of supply for those in need . ” ( Foodsharing Wiki that provides general infor - mation and rules on Foodsharing . de ) Another perception of fairness concerns contribution . In general , Foodsharing volunteers pick up the surplus food from supermar - kets and bring it to the SharingEvent . Yet , the Foodsavers as well as the volunteers at the SharingEvent could take what they want first . This was justified by the extra contribution they make , especially if financial cost were involved . This , however , conflicted with the prin - ciple that everybody , volunteers or guests , should have the same chance of being first . In Siegen , a ( re - ) distribution system developed over time , in which the helpers of SharingEvent hand out the food as well as food resources ( like seeds , soil or crops ) , while the guests stated what food ( resources ) they would like . An assessment is made by the helpers based on the amount of food ( resources ) on hand and the number of guests that day and is based on a collective judgment . Helpers could intervene when guests want to take ‘too much’ and point out that there are other guests . Debates about proper procedure continued , however , and two workshops were conducted to identify different views of fairness and establish some policy consensus . During the workshop it became clear that the concept of ( Re - ) Distributional Justice was an issue that correlated strongly with views concerning the group itself . After discussion , the group identified the relevant themes as ‘poverty relief , edu - cation , meeting people , improving the world , from redistribution to sharing , avoiding food waste , saving resources , personal bene - fit / added value’ . Most of the staff members emphasized connecting with others and tackling environmental problems ( sustainability issues around food ) . Most disapproved of the ‘first come , first serve’ approach , as it did not produce the desired community effects and did nothing to fuel other ongoing projects . Because volunteers faced several issues with this system , the organizing group collectively ruled that a ‘draw’ system will be implemented “so that there is no two - class society” ( Telegram Orga - nizational Group 03 / 04 / 2022 ) . Slips of paper with random numbers were distributed in the queue to determine order ( shuffled ) in the queue . The queueing system was iterated in order to resolve some difficulties , which had to do with several family members some - times being in the queue or there being too few tokens to allocate to everyone , and a ‘gamified’ version was introduced , using a memory - card game to draw the order , and also , before the SharingEvent started , all participants had the opportunity to decide on a special food prize from the food to be distributed to the last person whose memory card is drawn . The new queuing system makes the ( scarcity creating ) anti - cooperative practice ( investing time to be the first ) impossible and mitigates against competitiveness . In addition , the SharingEvent was perceived by all participants as much more en - tertaining . Since the previous queue was no longer necessary , a semicircle formed around the SharingEvent , in which all partici - pants stood and waited excitedly to see whether the equivalent of their memory - card was drawn . At a local level , then , perceived scarcity of supply determined judgements about fairness . Some mitigation occurred when Au - thorTwo became more present and had introduced the first version of the shuffled picking - order ( inspired by [ 5 ] ) , through which vol - unteers and guests had the same chance of being first . There is an implicit moral authority that comes with face - to - face contact that , at least to some extent , moderates what can otherwise be selfish behavior . The workshops sensitized the community to their differ - ent perspectives on the purpose of the SharingEvent . Through the workshops and in the weekly meetings in the community garden before the SharingEvent , common rules were iteratively established with all interested parties . Both action - oriented researchers con - sciously avoided any imposition of their perception of fairness onto ( Re - ) Distributional Food Justice : Negotiating conflicting views of fairness within a local grassroots community CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Figure 1 : SharingEvent and SharingHut24 / 7 as a hub for other sustainable food practices the community . The visible sensitivities that arose from face - to - face interaction prompted volunteers to deliberately interact more with the guests , especially in the period before the SharingEvent opened ( Covid - 19 had previously discouraged this ) . We can see this as , in embryonic form , embodying a recognition of the need for certain communal values to be made explicit . Yet , tensions are recognized , and when they arose during the SharingEvent or in online discus - sion , the action - oriented researchers addressed it right away and initiated face - to - face meetings for all interested parties . 5 . 3 SharingEvent / SharingHut24 / 7 as a Hub for other Sustainable Food Practices It was intended that SharingEvent as well as SharingHut24 / 7 should serve as a locus for other sustainable food practices ( see Figure 1 ) . In the two cities we describe , activists have created a number of loosely linked activities and resources . Respondent 7 considers the link to the community garden , for instance , to be important because food literacy can be conveyed through involvement in the community garden : “ [ One ] idea was , that exists through the garden , to introduce people to the [ SharingHut24 / 7 ] and to the garden , because planting food is also a food literacy , to know in general what does a plant need , how long does a plant need , how much space does a plant need , how much sun , how much water , etc . ” ( Respondent 7 , helper at the SharingEvent in Siegen ) For some , the local production of food was bound up in a cri - tique of capitalist modes of food production . Community gardens , well - established in Siegen , formed part of this wider agenda , and efforts were made to link the gardening activities to food resource sharing . The distribution of seedlings was one such effort . Many fruits and vegetables grown in the gardens were often distributed in the SharingEvent and guests have been encouraged to come and dig up their own . Biological waste from the SharingEvent is recycled in the garden . The community garden also acted as a space where people could wait for the SharingEvent to start . Helpers suggested that food and drink could be brought to the garden as well . Though these signs were and are only early signs they do point to the possibilities inherent in the developing network . Food production activities have become more common . In both Food - sharing cities , there were examples of guests bringing canned food back to SharingEvent to share . A helper of SharingEvent in Siegen , for instance , brought several jars of apple jelly to SharingEvent after noticing the apples in the community garden had not yet been picked . Several times a woman brought cake which her mother had baked . She was happy when “it reached the right people” . These were people who explicitly wanted to support the SharingEvent . “There was one who took something , then he baked a cake [ from it ] . He also boiled [ the ] things down and distributed them again the next time . He had fun with it . ” ( Respondent 12 , Foodsharing Ambassador in Giessen ) The SharingEvent and the SharingHut24 / 7 offer the possibility to make people aware of the organization of Foodsharing in general . People who want to get involved in Foodsharing get a low - threshold introduction through the SharingEvent : “There is a community , there’s food , it’s quite cozy , they’re nice , and when you grasp the idealism or the ecological idea behind it , then the entry hurdle is quite low . ” ( Respondent 12 , Foodsharing Ambassador in Giessen ) A wider issue related to food waste is that of food literacy . During the SharingEvents in Siegen , it became clear that many people were not aware of how much edible food is thrown away every day . It is argued that SharingEvents can contribute to increasing appreciation for food [ 4 ] and can highlight problems in the current food system [ 22 ] . SharingEvents provide a new infrastructure that can lead to already discarded food undergoing a value shift from “garbage” to “edible food” [ 22 ] . Uncertainties , however , exist during the SharingEvent when dealing with food that has passed its best - before date . There is a lack of knowledge about whether food can still be consumed . The helpers often provide information during the SharingEvent and explain that the best - before date does not mean that the food is inedible . The difference between sell - by and use - by dates are not understood . Furthermore , there is opportunity to spread knowledge about keeping and revitalizing fresh food : “ [ . . . ] then the things also don’t look so fresh , so many also really have this ‘it all has to look tip - top , other - wise I don’t want to use it’ . So about crooked carrots [ . . . ] or sometimes a bit limp salad , I mean , that is also quickly fresh again . [ . . . ] I think that really has to sink into the consciousness a bit more . ” ( Respondent 13 , guest at the SharingEvent ) Also , some guests lack basic cooking skills : “That is also something we noticed at the very begin - ning , when so many vegetables came and there was a demand for ready - made meals and you first had to CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Philip Engelbutzeder et al . explain how vegetables had to be cut and what they were and we ourselves were partly puzzled : ‘okay , something new again , these are turnips , this is man - gold’ . ” ( Respondent 7 , helper at the SharingEvent in Siegen ) This relates closely to community support activity objectives , in that people who pick up food often do not know how it can or should be prepared . One helper pointed out that , partly because of the queuing system , he did not find time to explain preparation properly . Several invitations , via Telegram , were issued to com - munal cooking events . One guest , who was a cook , offered cook - ing class evenings and to provide recipes . Remarking on a large number of left - over bread rolls , she noted , “You could still make super bread dumplings out of that ! ” . The Homeland - Association also runs a restaurant six times a week , where people can buy a three - course meal at a reasonable price . Finally , SharingEvent and SharingHut24 / 7 are linked to a local Free - Shop ( people bring goods for free and volunteers place it outside on an open place for anyone to take ) . Here , guests are also directly approached and invited to participate and contribute . In order to use the potential of the SharingHut24 / 7 as a hub to link other projects , further work is needed . There is an evident ambition , only as yet realized in part , to fulfil wider objectives by strengthening links between various groups so as to pursue the objective of building community . At very least , the SharingEvent has become a node in this network , one which serves to increase awareness of different elements . 5 . 4 Supporting the Formation of a Community The community that evolves can be understood as a Community of Interest [ 37 ] , “defined by their collective concern with the resolution of a problem” . Here , different people come together who have a common interest . The heterogeneity of the group can lead to a valuable exchange , but can also make a common understanding of goals difficult [ 37 ] . In our case we saw a tension between “sharing for charity” and " sharing for community” [ 65 ] . SharingEvent offers potential for community building , and some research does show that volunteer food sharing contributes to a sense of community [ 61 ] . The experience of community is shared by an Ambassador from Giessen : “What is super nice about the [ SharingEvents ] , what also attracted me to it a lot , is this community thing , that you somehow came together , that you also always met the same people there , the same Foodsavers , also the same people who always took food , so that we always made a bit of a happening out of it . ” Yet , the Foodsharing Ambassador from Giessen goes on : “That became more and more anonymous over time , which is a pity , it became more and more ‘oh that’s just work for us’ and less you come together and see each other and meet , there are already friendships and relationships that were lost over time , which I think is a pity . ” ( Respondent 9 , Foodsharing Ambassador from Giessen ) This echoes the experiences from Siegen . Action - oriented re - searchers repeatedly saw a threat to themselves and other people of being overwhelmed by routine responsibilities for coordination and organization at the expense of the overarching goals they set out with . For the growth of the community , the wider inclusion of inter - ested people is important . Support for community engagement can be variously for tasks for everyone to take on , or more complicated tasks that volunteers might accept . We aimed to provide a space for all interested people to support the SharingEvent , for example with musical contributions . Conducive to community building was the interweaving of the SharingEvent into various sustainable food and resource sharing practices , both in the area of sustainable food con - sumption and local production , and the sharing of knowledge and skills ( chapter 5 . 3 ) . Volunteers from the SharingEvent participated regularly in the Free - Shop , joined Foodsharing and took further responsibilities there or learned about activities in the community garden together . Numerous guests subsequently helped out reg - ularly at SharingEvents and became involved in other practices around SharingEvent and SharingHut24 / 7 . In the first 28 months , the community grew steadily . In addition to students and retirees , homeless people , people with disabili - ties and people from precarious living situations quickly became involved . In addition , post - Covid - 19 the community has made con - tinuous efforts to overcome language barriers . To this end , texts and videos were distributed or shown in different languages during the SharingEvent and attempts were made to engage people in conversation . As the months went by , it became apparent that there was more and more participation from people with immigrant back - grounds , e . g . , by bringing homemade food or helping with set - up and dismantling things . 5 . 5 ICT - Systems : Conflicting use of Foodsharing . de , Telegram and Facebook With regard to ICT , minimal overhead was very important . Vol - unteers and helpers do not see computer literacy as high on their agenda . Tools were quickly dropped when some members had dif - ficulty . The community coordinated its work through an artifact ecology [ 9 , 10 ] , described as “ [ . . . ] multifaceted , dynamic and pend - ing on what the members bring to the table , as well as on particular situations of use” [ 10 ] . ICT ( Text , Audio & Video ) supported the efforts of the helpers in a variety of ways , depending on the purpose in view ( see Table 2 ) : Even so , some conflicts arose over time as to which applications and / or platforms were most suitable for certain purposes . In gen - eral , the platform Foodsharing . de offers the functionality to support coordinating activities . Nevertheless , a Telegram group was opened at the beginning so that the helpers for the SharingEvent and Shar - ingHut24 / 7 could coordinate with each other . In addition , a ‘shift plan’ PAD was created on which the helpers for the SharingEvents registered and organized their work . The PAD fell out of use be - cause many of the helpers had access difficulties or the PAD display was too small on their smartphone . Personal inquiries take place almost entirely in the organization’s Telegram group . There was a clear desire from SharingEvent helpers to again use a shift schedule or slot function ( similar to the slot function on the Foodsharing ( Re - ) Distributional Food Justice : Negotiating conflicting views of fairness within a local grassroots community CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Table 2 : Use of ICT , their primary role , and their target audience ICT Target Group Primary Role Participants ( Jan’21 / Sep’22 ) Telegram group for organizational matters Helpers of the SharingEvent Coordination ; daily exchange of helpers 30 / 42 Public Telegram group Everybody , who is interested in SharingEvent and SharingHut24 / 7 Updates on the SharingHut24 / 7 and SharingEvent ; sharing food with each other ; discussions on ‘fairness’ 111 / 237 Zoom Helpers of the SharingEvent coordination ; exchange of helpers 6 - 9 / 0 Pad Helpers of the SharingEvent Shift schedule : self - organized fill in of helpers , who helps when ; coordination of the key ; collection of topics , to do , doing , done ; collection of links to protocols 0 / 0 Facebook Page Anyone interested in the topic of “food waste and food sharing” General information ( e . g . , about food waste ) 242 / 357 ( Likes ) Facebook group Anyone interested in SharingEvent and SharingHut24 / 7 Addition to the Telegram group for people who do not use Telegram 126 / 291 Foodsharing . de Foodsaver Coordination of food saving at food establishments ; information about SharingHut24 / 7 261 / 323 Telegram group for communal gardening Television : Videos in different languages Helpers of the communal garden Guests at the sharing event Coordination of work , information , picture - sharing Explaining the SharingEvent and invite people to participate Not yet established / 40 0 / 15 - 40 platform to coordinate who picks up and when in the corresponding supermarket - pickup - team ) . Various ICT systems are used in connection with the SharingEvent and SharingHut24 / 7 to coordinate helpers and as a source of information for guests . Both the Foodsharing platform and Telegram groups are used for these purposes . There were , how - ever , challenges associated with the Foodsharing platform . Use of the platform required users to understand how it functioned , which turned out to not be straightforward for some . Respondent 13 found the Foodsharing platform through the Google search engine , but she had trouble finding her way around . She describes that she found the map with publicly accessible redistribution sites ( like SharingHut24 / 7 ) , but then suddenly ended up in other cities : “I think I just entered something with Foodsharing Siegen and then it came up and I’m just , I have to admit unfortunately , not so good with all these tech - nical media and then I’m always tinkering around . But somewhere I got further in this Foodsharing platform , up to this map , where you could see these locations and then [ . . . ] I accidentally tapped on something . ” ( Re - spondent 13 , guest at the SharingEvent in Siegen ) Furthermore , it was not clear to respondent 13 how exactly the Foodsharing platform worked . She could not tell if she had to be - come a member or if she had to take the Foodsaver quiz ( mandatory quiz about rules and hygiene information in order to use the plat - form as a Foodsaver ) . At the same time , she emphasized that she is not very good with digital media : “It wasn’t really clear to me , do you have to [ become ] a member first , or can you look there otherwise , or do you have to take this test first , or not ? But it may also be because I’m just not that into using things like that . ” ( Respondent 13 , guest at the SharingEvent in Siegen ) After this experience , she stopped using the Foodsharing plat - form . Other users of the Foodsharing platform also felt over - whelmed . An Ambassador from Giessen reports that she gets fre - quent feedback from new Foodsharers suggesting that people are not coping well with the platform : “ [ . . . ] at the newbie meetings there were , yes , several times ‘yes I haven’t dealt with the platform yet , it’s too highly technical for me’ . ” ( Respondent 9 , Foodsharing Ambassador from Giessen ) Davies et al . emphasize that many grassroots movements have limited resources to invest in complex technology [ 24 ] and in this instance it appears that the Foodsharing . de platform was developed by and for people with a greater level of knowledge than most . Non - use by some key individuals caused some difficulty . Food collection was sometimes difficult because individuals were not registered on the platform and therefore were not able to collect CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Philip Engelbutzeder et al . surplus food . One helper was particularly annoyed when he learned that large quantities were available to be picked up , but little had arrived at the SharingEvent . This was because too few helpers were registered on the Foodsharing platform and thus did not receive notifications from the supermarket - team on Foodsharing . de , which coordinated the pickups . Equally problematic is that the platform has a hierarchy of rights and privileges which makes coordination difficult . The Foodsharing Wiki stresses that communication should be done via the platform as much as possible , but this became largely poured into the breach . This is justified by the fact that this is the only way to ensure that all members are reached . But disadvantages include that time - critical messages such as delays in pickups are not seen in time . The Foodsaver has to actively check the platform for current status updates . For such reasons , Telegram groups for communication , in addition to the platform , are used . The public Telegram group in Giessen has about 2300 members as of September 2022 . It is used to share the current status of the SharingEvent and to update current food status at different SharingHut24 / 7s . Similarly , a public Telegram group was started in Siegen named ‘Food SharingHut24 / 7 Siegen - Achenbach’ and was launched on October 6 , 2020 . Comments about the relative merits of the platform and the messaging system include : “The Foodsharing Telegram group is much more ac - tive . It is not only used for updates , but everyone can post ‘I myself have something to give away’ or some - thing like that , and that’s what some Foodsavers do : [ . . . ] they post either ‘I’m giving it away’ or ‘It’s right there’ , so that they immediately give it from person to person . ” ( Respondent 11 , Foodsharing Ambassador from Giessen ) Telegram groups were also used to strengthen community build - ing . The Foodsharing platform was seen as too static for community building : “ [ . . . ] this Foodsharing platform is not suitable for so - cial community building in my eyes . It’s too slow , it’s too static , and you need an email address and a browser and you can’t get it pushed to your phone . ” ( Respondent 11 , Foodsharing Ambassador from Giessen ) “The [ public Telegram ] group fosters a sense of com - munity regardless of age , social class , or cultural back - ground . ” ( Online survey participant 5 , 50 - 61 years ) Updates on the public Telegram group , which are published either in the form of photos and / or text , can be made by any member of the group . It is preferred to other messaging systems : “We have a Facebook account and Instagram account I think . We have tried to do this in a similar way , but in the end , there is simply not enough workforce to look after it . [ . . . ] With Facebook , you then have to assign the admin rights , [ . . . ] then it becomes confusing at some point . ” ( Respondent 9 , Foodsharing Ambassador from Giessen ) In addition , there is a separate Telegram group to support the coordination of pickups and instant communication with some cooperating companies in both cities . Delays in pickups or company - specific information are communicated via these groups : “ [ . . . ] I still have a separate Telegram group for each business / supermarket , which I ideally have to join , so that I can manage and communicate time - critical things and so on . ” ( Respondent 9 , Foodsharing Am - bassador from Giessen ) In sum , a simple messaging system with limited functionality is in general preferred to the more sophisticated platform because it is easy to use and makes coordinating work much more straight - forward . 6 DISCUSSION The literature [ 17 , 26 , 39 , 72 , 76 , 88 , 89 , 96 ] attests to the fact that there is more than one approach to food sustainability and that there is sometimes a tension between them . Our results show how these tensions manifest locally and originate from different notions about purposes and values . We could identify two broad notions concerning the purpose of SharingEvent and SharingHut24 / 7 . One is associated with the management of scarce or surplus resources and the other with a much wider concern for a transformation towards sustainable consumption and , equally importantly , produc - tion . This latter view is associated with a concern for community building . Besides a series of practical challenges , the practices of SharingEvent and SharingHut24 / 7 in this context are heavily medi - ated by sometimes conflicting values . Consequently , we subdivide the two perspectives further according to the values involved , in particular those resulting in conflicting notions of fairness – or ( re - ) distributional justice – which we will explicate in the following section . Our work is not predicated on adjudicating these versions , but more on supporting a space for healthy debate , and for opening up opportunities for engagement . Technological support for commu - nity building , in other words , can act to mitigate the tensions we otherwise see . That is where we see the primary outcome of the action - orientation of our research ( see chapter 3 . 1 ) . 6 . 1 Aligning Purposes through Community Building Direct resolution of the partly conflicting notions of fairness we identify is not our aim , nor to forcing an ICT system onto the com - munity that embodies what we deem to be fair . We are committed to the view that it is up to the community to resolve the tensions that arise . Nevertheless , we argue that community building is , in the longer term , the way to minimize , if not eradicate , these tensions . For the community to scale up and not to fracture it requires , we ar - gue , the alignment of different purposes evident in our data . These can be summed up in the following way . They roughly map onto the two main groups , those of guests and volunteers . However , this mapping is neither strict , nor do the people involved necessarily hold only one of these partly conflicting notions . Firstly , a notion of charitable fairness comes into play . Such a view sees those who are indigent as having priority . We see this both ( Re - ) Distributional Food Justice : Negotiating conflicting views of fairness within a local grassroots community CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany explicitly in the discussions and implicitly in the reasons visitors give for why they should be favored . This view also implies that those who benefit should take what is offered . A variant of this was manifest in the old queuing system , in which participants could invest their time by arriving early ( an issue that also arose in work by Berns et al . [ 5 , 6 ] ) , in that it encouraged a competitive attitude towards available food . Conversely , there are arguments that the volunteers that con - tribute by saving or ( re - ) distributing the food surplus should have priority ( see also , Berns et al . [ 5 , 6 ] ) . This transactional conception is sometimes explicitly arranged by volunteers . We call this notion contribution - related fairness . A different view emphasized the idea of equality - based fair - ness and was the basis for later versions of the queueing system . In this , no privilege was attached to arriving first to any conception of the ‘deserving’ . Instead , every participant that arrived at the SharingEvent had equal chances . There was general approval of this new approach , though some argued for a combination of the equality - based and the charitable . Common to the above three notions of fairness is a conception that the issue to be dealt with is the distribution of scarce resources . On the Foodsaver’s side , however , these resources are not perceived as scarce , but as a surplus that ought to be distributed in order to not go to waste . Foodsharing proclaims this fourth notion of no - waste fairness , according to which the main goal is that no food is wasted and therefore it does not particularly matter who consumes it . Such an organization aims to make itself unnecessary in the longer term ( as stated in the wiki on Foodsharing . de ) . These four notions are united in their conception that the pur - pose of the SharingEvent is , in some variant , the management of resources that are perceived to be either scarce or conversely avail - able as a surplus . A different conception , mainly held among some of the volunteers , is that the purpose of the SharingEvent , and their engagement in general , is directed at more sustainable food prac - tices . This purpose implies a fifth notion of systemic fairness . It entails an awareness of an unfair global food system that combines local activism with a ‘glocal’ stance [ 41 ] according to which the community building activities are much more than just recreational . The systemic view of fairness holds to a much wider concern with the network of beliefs , ideologies and material circumstances which ultimately might result in sustainable consumption and , equally im - portantly , production . As we have argued elsewhere [ 32 ] , scarcity is in large part a function of particular modes of production and consumption . Put differently , food and related resources are not in and of themselves scarce but become so because the practices of food management involve neither new forms of production nor distribution . Part of the work of local initiatives is then , or should be , to pro - vide creative alternatives . In contrast , ‘sharing for charity’ as Miche - lini et al . [ 65 ] frame the charitable view of fairness , is contentious for various reasons . The rigid distinction between provider and beneficiary can stigmatize as being relevant only in ‘low - income’ contexts . This creates a barrier to participation because people want to avoid that stigma [ 30 , 51 , 73 ] . By indirectly valuing indigence the , in our words , charitable notion of fairness risks reproducing it . Furthermore , if beneficiaries perceive themselves at the receiving end of a unidirectional process , no shared ideology or cooperative community engagement is facilitated among them . Kessl et al . [ 51 ] point out that social exclusion and food assistance are highly con - nected : “Giving excess food / surplus to those in need does not only not tackle the very reasons for their dependency . It is over and above [ . . . ] ‘a one - way street of charitable supply”’ , because a sharp separation between beneficiary and provider persists . They fur - ther argue , “ [ h ] aving no choice but to take the leftovers of others’ choices is what social exclusion and disaffiliation mean” [ 51 ] . We saw community discussions about whether even that choice was ‘fair’ or not . The tensions inherent in these different views are manifest in very pragmatic ways . Viewing the purpose of the event and the management of engagement as a function of scarce resources and / or surplus as against a more systemic view leads to different priorities . This is evident in the different uses to which technologies such as the Telegram groups as against Foodsharing . de were put . Tele - gram groups were regarded as easy to access and use , and flexible enough that they could incorporate a range of interests and views , in contrast to Foodsharing . de which was associated only with co - ordination of pickups . Given that activists often have little interest in technology , the flexibility of Telegram was vital : “This Telegram group I definitely find very uncompli - cated and I am truly quite dumb with such things . So , if it’s not straightforward , then I don’t like to use it . ” ( Respondent 13 , guest at the SharingEvent in Siegen ) Meshing [ 59 ] the ICT used for SharingEvent and SharingHut24 / 7 with other local sustainable food practices ( like communal cook - ing , communal gardening or the Free - Shop ) outside of Telegram presents challenges , especially when it comes to Foodsharing . de . We have observed that communication is shifting from Foodshar - ing . de to Telegram , while the coordination of pickups remains on the platform . While only a few volunteers appropriated the rather complicated platform of Foodsharing , minimal overhead was what led to the success of Telegram . If a volunteer had difficulties with some ICT , the community supported its appropriation , but also dropped certain ICT , like the PAD , when more members had diffi - culty . Related work on infrastructuring [ 58 , 85 ] demonstrates how knowledge and skill intersect with technology use . Norton et al . [ 71 ] argued , for the agricultural communities they investigated , that members can find technology distracting . They primarily desire more fruitful interaction with other people and with nature , and are therefore more inclined to be selective in their use of technology [ 71 ] . Aligning the different purposes of technology and supporting the community in its use of artifact ecologies [ 9 , 10 ] , then , will need community building . For the long - term success of an organization , community build - ing is , we firmly believe , necessary . This must , by definition , begin with social encounters . Therefore , the proposed design must furnish a space for creation and maintenance of valuable personal relation - ships [ 7 ] . From spring 2022 , sitting together before a SharingEvent and especially reflecting on the last event , brainstorming new ideas for design iterations , and coordinating the upcoming event was regularly done in the communal garden with more and more guests showing up or bringing self - made food to share . Likewise , the cook - ing events , especially in the context of the Free - Shop , in which members of the SharingEvent also volunteered , serve to build new CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Philip Engelbutzeder et al . relationships within the community . Furthermore , the communal garden can actively contribute to the creation of a community that grows food locally and shares knowledge and resources to - gether . Along with this , the technology must support the long - term resilience of a project and “ITs [ . . . ] should work within their se - lective use values” [ 71 ] . This especially so since , in the context of SharingEvent and SharingHut24 / 7 , people regularly join and leave the project , ways must be found to preserve knowledge , routines and information so that subsequent members can draw on them . This is the only way to promote sustainability [ 7 ] . While different views on fairness are negotiated within the com - munity , we as action - oriented researchers must be careful to not “just dump technology on people” [ 90 ] . A gentle nudge is all we can aim for . Norton et al . conclude : “Developing information systems based on the values and practices of sustainability communities [ . . . ] has the potential to transform the information system landscape to one that can support the design and development of sustainable agriculture , if not one that is broadly sustainable and equitable” [ 71 ] . 6 . 2 The Role of Action - Oriented Researchers It follows from what we have described that we cannot and do not provide short term solutions . A more systematic treatment of the approach we took and the emerging consequences will be the sub - ject of another paper as the community further develops . Our work contributes to a more general consideration of fairness in design by showing that different conceptions of fairness produce different outcomes in important ways . Other fairness related discussions within the broader field of HCI recently revolve around algorithmic fairness , understood as decision - making of ( mostly AI powered ) algorithms that are perceived to be just [ 75 ] . Algorithmic fairness is always reliant on underlying context - specific perceptions , which qualitative HCI studies ( e . g . , [ 36 ] ) seek to uncover . If design is inevitably about change [ 44 ] , then the direction of change is very much relevant to our design decisions , and the tensions we describe inform both challenges and opportunities that arise . The issue of ( Re - ) Distributional Justice turns out to be fundamental here , while also appearing in other contexts of food surplus allocation and beyond ( see e . g . , [ 56 ] ) . This boils down to a frequently raised discussion on “who gets what , why and when ? ” . The answer , however , turns out to be highly complex , in that the people involved often understand the value of justice , or fairness , differently . In addition , suggestions about the ( re - ) distribution carry implicit ideas about what should be valued and thus rewarded or supported . We have made no attempt to design a technological tool imple - menting those notions of fairness precisely because community building cannot be imposed . We draw on a large body of past work [ 3 , 21 , 27 , 50 , 58 , 85 ] that demonstrates how sustainability and civic challenges are better approached by innovative use cases rather than “technological quick - fixes” [ 50 ] . We argue that scaling ( Re - ) distributional Justice in accordance with sustainability is not a matter of technological implementation but that “it is possible to imagine and design change at a broader level of community en - gagement” [ 50 ] . Therefore , instead our action - orientation is aimed at supporting this process of community resolution and more broadly reflecting on design opportunities ( and anti - designs [ 81 ] ) together with this Community of Interest [ 37 ] ( see chapter 5 . 2 and 5 . 4 ) . To consider a design that allows the community ( both visitors and volunteers ) to settle tensions themselves , we propose the following design recom - mendations from our engagement as action - oriented researchers : • Support community engagement through contribution , by offering tasks that are easy to take on , helping volunteers take on more complicated tasks , supporting the sharing of skills and resources , and opening up a space for complemen - tary contributions . Contributing to a collaborative project fosters meaningful relationships and relieves the workload of other helpers in the long run ( see chapter 5 . 4 ) . • Facilitate engagement with the day - to - day problems of peo - ple and embody ‘care’ for the community [ 63 ] rather than keeping “an emotional distance that enables the researcher to produce an organized account by playing down the disorient - ing messiness of everyday experience” [ 64 ] . Communicate appreciation to every single person for ‘being there’ at least as much as for their contribution to the project ( see chapter 5 . 4 ) . • Maximize opportunities for participation in activities and discussions taking place offline and online . Technological assistance can be provided , often with little effort ( e . g . , down - loading an app or sending an invite - link for a Telegram group ; see chapter 5 . 5 ) . • Support initiatives from anyone who wants to discuss issues , like ( re - ) distributional justice . Address actual instances of tension between different perceptions of fairness when they take place . Try to show the different points of view in an understandable way and support the acute and long - term communication for their alignment . Open up spaces in form of meetings and workshops and maintain them , especially through regular invitation and an appealing design ( e . g . , the regular meetings in the community garden before the SharingEvent ) . • Moderate decision - making processes and subsequent design choices regarding what notion ( s ) of fairness the community wants to commit to ( e . g . , the implementation of the memory - card game to support the equality - based notion of fairness ) . • Facilitate cooperative rather than rival engagement , e . g . , through entertainment and gamification . As Riar’s literature review shows gamification can achieve various “psychologi - cal outcomes such as fun , enjoyment , collective intentions , positive user experience and emotions , as well as social out - comes such as relatedness , increased group cohesion , col - laborative skills , altruism , social identity , group norms and other group dynamics” [ 78 ] . Simply redistributing surplus food has nothing to do with sus - tainable practice . Our focus has been very much on transforming conventional food practices : because , as one participant put it , “sav - ing and redistributing food only tries to alleviate the symptoms of a sick food system” ( field notes 23 / 01 / 2022 ) . To get to the root causes , transformational change needs to start with local food practices . ( Re - ) Distributional Food Justice : Negotiating conflicting views of fairness within a local grassroots community CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany The integration of local socialized bodies as active parts of trans - formative food practices works well in a community , prompted by activist intervention , that is striving towards abundance . We have argued elsewhere , that abundance and commitment to ‘just enough’ fosters the non - rivalrous approach that ‘the more I share with you , the more will ultimately be shared with others’ [ 32 ] . A simple change in the communal logic of practice from rivalrous to sharing can set a bunch of transformative food practices in motion . The question is , how to establish an awareness of the differences between managing the surplus of an unsustainable system and fos - tering sustainable practices that create abundance ? Abundance in the context of community building means that everybody is invited to make a complementary contribution where possible . Abundance lies in the ‘just enough’ of sufficiency . Surplus food , if it is not scarce , creates a utopian space as Bogusz and Holtappels describe in the context of methods of performative sociology [ 11 ] , where there is more than enough free food for everybody . When surplus food is deployed as a gift to a community it can act as a catalyst for sustainable food practices in communities striving towards abun - dance [ 32 ] ( like ‘disco soup’ , an event where surplus food is cooked together [ 92 ] ) . Yet there remains a tension in the activists’ endeavor , in that they want to leave the unsustainable mainstream formation of practice behind and integrate local people into an assembly of sustainable food practices through the means of surplus to motivate the at - tendee group towards community engagement . The activist group uses the surplus of the mainstream formation of food practices , but at the same time seeks to transform it . So , neither the activist group , nor the group they aim to recruit , might want – in the short term – to get rid of the mainstream formation of food practices , since the transformative practices of food sharing , in a sense , depend on its ‘waste’ . Here we argue with ‘third space knowledge’ of Bogusz and Holtappels [ 11 ] and ‘post - normal conversation science’ of Buschke et al . [ 15 ] , activists can open up a room in which deep change [ 97 ] towards sustainability can take place and be experienced , es - pecially where a diverse group can negotiate sustainability issues during their daily life commitments . The intended practices of trans - formation start from the display of a demonstrably central issue : food waste . Around that , activists can open up the possibilities for engagement by prompting awareness of the issues around redistri - bution , inviting others to join and to contribute . As we have shown above , the diverse group shares different values and purposes that are negotiated in a community building process . Transformation is about bringing a mix of practices , issues and possible solutions ( different values ) together to be negotiated and then to be tried out . We aim to support certain community practices that foster a change towards more sustainability ( long term transformation ) . There will be no ‘perfect starting point’ , no ‘right way’ towards transforma - tion , and no ‘either or’ ( 0 or 1 ) within transformation . Rather we , as action - oriented researchers , need to support the plenum of social practices during a process of post - normal science [ 20 ] . 7 CONCLUSION This paper has investigated the different notions of fairness being negotiated in a local grassroots community that regularly shares ‘rescued’ surplus food and food resources in a SharingEvent and supports SharingHut24 / 7 , where everyone can put and take food ( resources ) at any time . Through 28 months of action - oriented re - search we have gained insights into the practices involved and the roles that ICT plays , especially in supporting sustainable food prac - tices in a normatively mediated , and contested , situation . Thereby , this study contributes to research on sustainable food practices in the context of Human - Food - Interaction , focusing on the social aspects of food ( resource ) sharing . Our findings show that issues such as fairness , stigma , social norms , and lack of food knowledge present challenges . Likewise , various possibilities became clear , such as the use of a commu - nity garden and common cooking events to support sustainable food practices . SharingEvent and SharingHut24 / 7 have contributed to the emergence of a community where common resources and knowledge are shared and developed . Digital artifacts have been used to coordinate , provide information , and support community building , but also to facilitate discussion of issues of justice in food ( re - ) distribution . A public and organizational Telegram group as well as other ICT were introduced to further support coordinating practices around the SharingEvent and SharingHut24 / 7 and keep the sharing practices open and dynamic . We have derived five different conceptions of fairness in play : Charitable , Contribution - oriented , Equality - based , No - waste , and Systemic Fairness . Subsequently we reflected on the alignment of the conflicting notions of fairness and the role of action - oriented researchers within the negotiation process taking place . Regarding the design of ICT , we suggest that in order to align the different pur - poses of SharingEvent and technology , and support the community in the use of its artifact ecology [ 9 , 11 ] , facilitating the negotiation processes of community building is paramount . From our stance , redistributing rescued food surplus is connected to a wider agenda to transform consumption - oriented practices and embrace sustainable food resource spaces . Here , diverse groups share different values and purposes in order to promote prosump - tion and abundance , ultimately fostering a deep change in food systems [ 97 ] . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors want to express their heartfelt gratitude to all volun - teers and guests who participated in the SharingEvent , as well as the Homeland Association . We are truly grateful to the reviewers for their insightful and comprehensive feedback . Finally , we want to extend our sincerest appreciation to Leonie Jahn for her valuable support .
