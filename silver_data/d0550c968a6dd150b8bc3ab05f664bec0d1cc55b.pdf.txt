A RT I C L E S FAK , talin and PIPKI γ regulate endocytosed integrin activation to polarize focal adhesion assembly Guilherme P . F . Nader 1 , Ellen J . Ezratty 1 and Gregg G . Gundersen 1 , 2 Integrin endocytic recycling is critical for cell migration , yet how recycled integrins assemble into new adhesions is unclear . By synchronizing endocytic disassembly of focal adhesions ( FAs ) , we ﬁnd that recycled integrins reassemble FAs coincident with their return to the cell surface and dependent on Rab5 and Rab11 . Unexpectedly , endocytosed integrins remained in an active but unliganded state in endosomes . FAK and Src kinases co - localized with endocytosed integrin and were critical for FA reassembly by regulating integrin activation and recycling , respectively . FAK sustained the active integrin conformation by maintaining talin association with Rab11 endosomes in a type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase ( PIPKI γ ) - dependent manner . In migrating cells , endocytosed integrins reassembled FAs polarized towards the leading edge , and this polarization required FAK . These studies identify unanticipated roles for FA proteins in maintaining endocytosed integrin in an active conformation . We propose that the conformational memory of endocytosed integrin enhances polarized reassembly of FAs to enable directional cell migration . Directional cell migration is critical for developmental and homeo - static processes in multicellular organisms 1 . Abnormal cell migration contributes to cancer metastasis , atherosclerosis and inflammation . Deciphering mechanisms of migration is thus essential to understand - ing both physiological and disease processes . The formation of adhesive contacts between the cell and its extracellular matrix ( ECM ) substratum is a central process in migration . Integrins are the principal membrane receptors mediating these contacts in migrating cells . On ECM association , integrins cluster into dynamic multi - component focal complexes and FAs that transmit force during migration and regulate the cytoskeleton and signalling for cell survival , division and diﬀerentiation 2 – 6 . Cell migration requires both assembly and disassembly of FAs . Mapping shows two main regions of FA disassembly : the tail and the lamella just distal to sites of FA maturation 7 – 9 . Compared with FA assembly , FA disassembly and fate of the disengaged integrins are less well understood . Factors implicated in FA disassembly include calpain cleavage of adhesion components 10 , 11 , targeted ECM degradation 9 and enhanced contractility that detaches FAs from the substratum 12 – 14 . Recently , endocytosis of integrin triggered by microtubule ( MT ) targeting of FAs and mediated by dynamin , clathrin and its adaptors has emerged as a major contributor to FA disassembly 15 – 19 . Critically , MTs stimulate endocytosis only of integrins engaged in FAs and imaging reveals that integrins are directly endocytosed from FAs 15 . The fate of endocytosed integrin during FA disassembly and its relationship to cell motility is unknown . Bretscher and colleagues provided early evidence that most integrins are constitutively endocytosed and recycled 20 , 21 and proposed that recycling delivers integrin to the leading edge to form new adhesions 22 . The existence of such a directed recycling pathway remains controversial , yet recent studies have identified traﬃcking factors for integrins that are also required for eﬃcient cell migration .

These studies establish correlations between bulk integrin recy - cling and cell migration 31 . Yet , bulk endocytosis includes unengaged integrins , which are constitutively endocytosed 20 , 21 , and it is unclear whether integrin previously engaged in FAs behaves as the unengaged pool . Additionally , it is unclear whether integrins endocytosed during FA disassembly are recycled and , if so , whether they directly reassem - ble into FAs or undergo activation or other steps before reassembly . RESULTS FA reassembly occurs with a lag after MT - induced FA disassembly To study the fate of integrin endocytosed from FAs , we adapted the system of MT regrowth after nocodazole ( NZ ) washout used to synchronize disassembly of FAs 15 – 19 , 32 – 34 .

All rights reserved A RT I C L E S FAs reformed with a lag after MT - induced FA disassembly 16 , 19 , 33 , but did not identify the nature of the lag or whether FA reformation required recycling of integrins . We first determined precisely the lag in FA reassembly after MT - induced FA disassembly . MT regrowth triggered virtually complete FA disassembly in NIH3T3 fibroblasts 60min after NZ washout 15 , 16 ( Fig . 1a ) . As assessed by immunofluorescence of vinculin and other FA markers and quantitative analysis of either FA number or total area , FA reassembly began 90min after NZ washout , a lag of 30min after FA disassembly ( Fig . 1a , b and Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Reformation of FAs did not reflect changes in cell area ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . Biochemical markers of FAs , FAK - pY397 or paxillin - pY118 , decreased after disassembly as previously reported 16 , but then increased at 80 – 90min , coincident with FA reassembly ( Fig . 1c , d and Supplementary Fig . 1e ) . We used total internal reflection microscopy and a stable NIH3T3 cell line expressing paxillin – EGFP to examine FAs dynamically . This cell line expressed paxillin – EGFP at levels comparable to endogenous paxillin and exhibited FA distribution and migration rates similar to parental cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1c , d , f ) . Consistent with fixed cell assays , live cell imaging revealed that FA reformation began 30min after complete FA disassembly in individual cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1g and Supplementary Video 1 ) . Notably , by either fixed or live cell assays , FA reassembly was spatially biased : most reassembled FAs localized near the cell periphery in contrast to their random localization before FA disassembly ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 1a , g , h ) . Thus , FA reassembly lags FA disassembly by 30min and biases FAs towards the cell periphery . FA reassembly requires endocytic integrin recycling We next tested whether FA reassembly required recycling of integrins endocytosed after MT - induced FA disassembly 18 , 20 . After 60min of MT regrowth , surface levels of α 5 integrin decreased to 50 % of those in NZ - treated cells as reported earlier 15 ( Fig . 1e ) . Coincident with the reassembly of FAs at 90 – 100min after MT regrowth , integrin surface levels increased , reaching ∼ 80 % of the level before MT regrowth ( Fig . 1e ) . Theseresultsindicatethatasmuchas60 % oftheendocytosed integrin was recycled after MT regrowth . Consistent with this , surface biotinylation assays showed that ∼ 45 % of the α 5 integrin endocytosed during FA disassembly was recycled by the time FAs reassembled and total levels of α 5 integrin assessed by western blot did not change during MT regrowth ( Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) . We used α 5 integrin – GFP to monitor integrin traﬃcking . At 60min after MT regrowth , integrin co - localized with Rab11 in the perinuclear endocytic recycling compartment ( ERC ; Fig . 1f ) . The accumulated α 5 integrin – GFP in the ERC decreased at 120min after MT regrowth , coincident with the return of surface integrin and the reappearanceofFAs ( Fig . 1f ) . Endocytosedintegrindidnotco - localize with the Golgi apparatus ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) and disruption of Golgi traﬃcking with brefeldin A did not block FA disassembly or reassembly ( Supplementary Fig . 2d ) . Collectively , these results suggest that endocytosed integrin traﬃcs through the Rab11 ERC after FA disassembly before recycling back to the cell surface to reassemble new FAs . We tested the role of Rabs in integrin recycling and FA reassembly after MT - induced FA disassembly by transiently transfecting dominant - negative Rab mutants ( Rab5 S34N and Rab11 S25N ) . Neither mutant interfered with FA disassembly , but both prevented FA reassembly , whereas wild - type Rab11 or EGFP had no eﬀect on either process ( Supplementary Fig . 2e – g ) . Knockdown of Rab11a and Rab11b , the main Rab11 isoforms expressed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts , with short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) oligonucleotides ( Supplementary Fig . 2h ) , confirmed that Rab11 was required for FA reassembly , but not disassembly or MT regrowth ( Fig . 1g , h ) . Importantly , Rab11 - depleted fibroblasts failed to restore their surface integrin levels after 90min of MT regrowth ( Fig . 1i ) . These results further establish that integrins are recycled after FA disassembly and that FA reassembly is coupled to this recycling . FAK and Src family kinases ( SFKs ) regulate reassembly of endocytosed integrin After FA disassembly , we observed activated FAK ( FAK - pY397 ) accumulation at a perinuclear site that co - localized with Rab11 ( Fig . 2a ) . On FA reassembly 120min after MT regrowth , FAK - pY397 was no longer observed at the Rab11 ERC , but instead redistributed to FAs ( Fig . 2a ) . These results suggest that FAK may participate in the recycling of integrins and / or their reassembly into FAs . FAK scaﬀolding functions in MT - induced FA disassembly by recruiting dynamin to FAs 16 , 18 . Whether FAK kinase activity is important for MT - induced FA disassembly or reassembly has not been tested . To address this , we expressed FAK autophosphorylation site ( Y397F ) or kinase active site ( K454R ) mutant constructs in Fak − / − fibroblasts , which exhibit impaired MT - induced FA disassembly 16 . Re - expression of wild - type FAK – GFP rescued FA disassembly and reassembly , whereas re - expression of FAK Y397F – GFP and FAK K454R – HArescuedFAdisassemblybutnotreassembly ( Fig . 2b – d ) . Consistent with the re - expression experiments , treating cells with the FAK inhibitor PF228 ( ref . 35 ) blocked FA reassembly in a concentration - dependent manner without interfering with FA disassembly ( Fig . 2e , f and Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . Similar results were observed with a structurally distinct FAK inhibitor ( Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . FAK and Src are major partners and Src was previously implicated in FA reassembly 33 . We tested whether SFK activity was required for FA reassembly by treating cells with PP2 , a selective SFK inhibitor 36 . PP2 had no detectable eﬀect on FA disassembly but blocked FA reassembly ( Fig . 2e , f ) . Inhibition of FA reassembly in FAK - and SFK - inhibited cells was also evident biochemically using paxillin - pY118 as a FA marker ( Supplementary Fig . 1e ) . Inhibition of FA reassembly by PF228 and PP2 was reversible : FAs began reassembling 10min after drug washout and by 30 min reached the same levels as controls ( Supplementary Fig . 3c , d ) . These results show that FAK and SFK activities are required for FA reassembly and that FAK scaﬀolding and kinaseactivitiesseparatelyorchestrateFAdisassemblyandreassembly . FAK and SFKs affect distinct steps in FA reassembly Src also localized in the Rab11 ERC after FA disassembly ( Supplemen - taryFig . 3e ) , consistentwithearlierlocalizationstudies 37 – 39 . Toaddress whether FAK and SFKs contribute to integrin recycling from the ERC , we measured surface α 5 integrin after MT - induced FA disassembly in the presence of either PF228 or PP2 . Neither inhibitor altered the loss of surface integrin after FA disassembly , but PP2 - treated cells failed to restore integrin surface levels 100min after NZ washout ( Fig . 3a ) .

All rights reserved 495 A RT I C L E S the ERC , but appeared as diﬀuse labelling over the cell ( Fig . 3b ) . Quantification of α 5 integrin – GFP fluorescence in the Rab11 ERC confirmed these observations ( Fig . 3c ) . Thus , whereas both FAK and SFKs are required for the reassembly of FAs after MT - induced FA disassembly , only SFKs are required for integrin return to the cell surface . FAK maintains endocytosed integrin in an active conformation The lack of FA reassembly in FAK - inhibited cells despite the return of surface integrin suggested that FAK might regulate the activation state of the endocytosed integrins . To test this , we resuspended cells at 90min of MT regrowth and assayed their adherence to fibronectin ( FN ) - coated surfaces . As expected , SFK - inhibited cells showed reduced binding to FN relative to controls ( Fig . 3d ) . Interestingly , FAK - inhibited cells showed similar reduced binding to FN as the SFK - inhibited cells ( Fig . 3d ) . Adding Mn 2 + to artificially activate integrins 40 rescued the reduced binding of FAK - inhibited , but not SFK - inhibited , cells ( Fig . 3d ) , consistent with the inability of the latter to return integrin to the cell surface . Paralleling the cell binding results , Mn 2 + addition to adherent cells 80min after MT regrowth rescued FA reassembly in FAK - inhibited , but not SFK - inhibited , cells ( Fig . 3e ) . Mn 2 + also rescued FA reassembly in Fak − / − cells re - expressing FAK - kinase - defective mutants and failed to rescue FA reassembly in Rab11a / b - depleted cells ( Supplementary Fig . 4a – d ) . To test directly the ligand - binding state of α 5 β 1 integrin , we quantified by fluorescence - activated cell sorting analysis binding of a biotinylated FN fragment comprising the RGD and synergy sites that bind integrins 41 . Both FAK - and SFK - inhibited cells exhibited reduced FN fragment binding compared with control cells ( Fig . 3f ) . The eﬀect of FAK inhibitor was reversible as binding was restored to control levels after PF228 washout ( Fig . 3f ) . Together , these results indicate a previously unsuspected role for FAK kinase activity in controlling the activation state of endocytosed integrins from disassembled FAs . To determine when FAK was required for activating endocytosed integrin , we localized active α 5 β 1 integrin after FA disassembly with antibodies that specifically detect active integrin epitopes . Owing to the availability of multiple antibodies to active human integrins , we conducted these experiments in human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells , which also require clathrin and dynamin for MT - induced FA disassembly 17 . WeconfirmedthatHT1080cellsdisassembledtheirFAs after 60min of NZ washout and reassembled them with a lag after disassembly , and that PF228 treatment inhibited FA reassembly , but not disassembly ( Supplementary Fig . 5a , b ) . Thus , multiple features of MT - induced FA disassembly and reassembly are recapitulated in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells . After FA disassembly , integrin first traﬃcs through Rab5 early endosomes 15 . We tested whether active integrin accumulated in Rab5 endosomes after FA disassembly by transfecting HT1080 cells with constitutively active Rab5 Q79L , which artificially enlarges early endosomes . Before NZ washout , staining with 12G10 antibody , which specifically recognizes conformationally active β 1 integrin 42 , was barely detectable in Rab5 endosomes ; in contrast , 30min after NZ washout when most FAs had disassembled , 12G10 staining significantly increased in Rab5 endosomes ( Fig . 4a – c ) . Notably , FAK co - localized with active integrin in Rab5 endosomes after NZ washout ( Fig . 4a , b ) . At 60min after FA disassembly , a strong signal of active β 1 integrin co - localized with Rab11 and active FAK - pY397 in the ERC ( Fig . 4d and Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . At 120min after NZ washout when FAs had reassembled , active β 1 integrin was nearly depleted from the Rab11 ERC ( Fig . 4d , e ) . The ERC accumulation of active β 1 integrin and FAK - pY397 depended on FA disassembly as inhibiting MT - induced FA disassembly with the dynamin inhibitor dynasore ( Supplementary Fig . 5d ) strongly prevented ERC accumulation of active β 1 integrin ( Fig . 4d , e ) and FAK - pY397 ( Supplementary Fig . 5e , f ) . Staining with HUTS - 4 antibody , which detects a distinct epitope on active β 1 integrin 42 , showed similar ERC accumulation of active integrin ( Supplementary Fig . 6a ) . To test the FAK dependence of the active integrin conformation during endocytic recycling , we triggered MT - induced FA disassembly and allowed integrin to accumulate in the ERC for 60min in the presence of PF228 . Whereas active β 1 integrin was detected in the ERC in control cells , it was markedly reduced in PF228 - treated cells ( Fig . 4f , g ) . PF228 treatment did not reduce accumulation of total β 1 integrin in the ERC as shown with an antibody ( K20 ) insensitive to the conformational state of β 1 integrin ( Fig . 4f ) . In contrast , inhibition of SFKs did not aﬀect active β 1 integrin accumulation in the ERC after FA disassembly ( Supplementary Fig . 6b , c ) . Combined , these results show that integrin endocytosed from disassembled FAs travels through Rab5 and Rab11 compartments in an active conformation maintained by FAK . Integrins endocytosed from FAs seem to trafﬁc without FN We next tested whether the integrins endocytosed from FAs traﬃcked withtheirligandFN . BeforeNZwashout , FNinHT1080cellsappeared as fibrillar structures and small intracellular puncta , presumably vesicles ; after NZ washout , fibrillar FN was reduced , presumably because of FA disassembly ( Fig . 5a ) . At 30min after NZ washout , FN was not detected in Rab5 endosomes with active integrin ( Fig . 5b ) . At 60min after NZ washout , little FN co - localized with active β 1 integrin in the ERC and its level was unaﬀected by dynasore treatment , which blocked active integrin accumulation ( Fig . 5c , d ) . Collectively , these results suggest that integrins endocytosed from FAs do not traﬃc with their FN ligand . FAK maintains activity of endocytosed integrin through talin and PIPKI γ i2 signalling Talin functions as the canonical activator of integrins by binding the cytoplasmic tails of β integrins 43 , 44 . Knockdown of talin1 did not alter MT - induced FA disassembly , but inhibited the subsequent reassembly of FAs in HT1080 ( Fig . 6a – c ) and NIH3T3 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 7a – c ) . Talin co - localized with the Rab11 ERC 60min after FA disassembly in both cell types ( Fig . 6d and Supplementary Fig . 7d ) . In talin1 - depleted cells , active β 1 integrin did not accumulate in the Rab11 ERC after FA disassembly , although total β 1 integrin co - localizing with the ERC also seemed reduced ( Fig . 6e ) . As FAK inhibition reduced active integrin in the ERC , we tested whether PF228 altered talin localization and found that PF228 substantially reduced talin levels in the ERC ( Fig . 6d , f ) . These results indicate that FAK kinase activity is critical for talin recruitment to the ERC following FA disassembly where it is crucial to keep integrins in an active conformation . 496 © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Next we asked how FAK kinase activity recruits talin to the Rab11 ERC and aﬀects integrin activation . FAK is not known to phospho - rylate talin ; however , it does regulate phosphorylation of the PIPKI γ isoform , PIPKI γ i2 ( also known as PIPKI γ 90 or PIPKI γ 668 ; ref . 45 ) to increase its activity 46 , 47 . PIPKI γ i2 generates phosphotidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) , which enhances talin association with membranes and integrin tails and integrin activation 48 , 49 . PIPKI γ was implicated in FA reassembly after MT regrowth in HT1080 cells 19 , but the mechanism was not determined . We confirmed this result with siRNAs that targeted all splice variants of PIPK1 γ ( Supplementary Fig . 8a – c ) .

Critically , talin co - immunoprecipitated with PIPKI γ i2 – GFP at 60min of NZ washout when both proteins localized to the ERC and treatment with PF228 reduced both PIPKI γ i2 – GFP phosphotyrosine levels and talin association with PIPKI γ i2 – GFP ( Fig . 7f ) . Last , we asked whether increasing PIPKI γ i2 activity can overcome theblockinFAreassemblyinFAK - inhibitedcells . Cellsoverexpressing PIPKI γ i1 or PIPKI γ i2 exhibited normal FA disassembly ( Fig . 7h ) . Strikingly , FA reassembly was rescued in FAK - inhibited cells expressing PIPKI γ i2 but not PIPKI γ i1 ( Fig . 7g , h ) . Together these findings show that PIPKI γ i2 recruits talin to the ERC in a FAK - dependent fashion and this is critical to maintain FA - derived integrins in an active state during endocytic recycling . FAK and SFKs orchestrate integrin recycling in migrating cells We analysed FA dynamics in migrating cells treated with PF228 or PP2 to test whether results from the NZ washout system were physiologically relevant . Both kinase inhibitors inhibit migration 18 , 33 , 35 , 51 . We found that they allowed FA disassembly but blocked FA reassembly in cells migrating directionally in wounded monolayers ( Fig . 8a , c ) or randomly on FN - coated surfaces ( Supplementary Fig . 8d ) . The rate of FA disassembly in cells treated with FAK and SFK inhibitors was similar to that in dimethylsulphoxide ( DMSO ) - treated cells ( 0 . 022 ± 0 . 007min − 1 for DMSO , 0 . 018 ± 0 . 004min − 1 for PF228 and 0 . 017 ± 0 . 005 for PP2 ) , values comparable to those reported for NIH3T3 fibroblasts 52 . On inhibitor washout , FAs reassembled faster in FAK - inhibited cells ( t 1 / 2 = 5min ) compared with SFK - inhibited migrating cells ( t 1 / 2 = 25min ; Fig . 8b , c ) , consistent with the MT - regrowth results showing integrin arrest in the ERC in SFK - but not FAK - inhibited 498 © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

All rights reserved 501 A RT I C L E S DISCUSSION Our study shows that FA disassembly and reassembly are coupled through an integrin endocytic recycling pathway and that this cycle polarizes FA formation in migrating cells . Combined with earlier results , we propose a model for reassembly of FAs from recycled integrins in which FAK , talin , PIPKI γ i2 and SFKs play previously un - suspected roles ( Fig . 8h ) . The key steps of the model are : MT - induced disassembly of FAs results in clathrin - and dynamin - dependent endo - cytosis of FA integrins 15 – 17 ; these integrins transit through Rab5 and Rab11 endosomal compartments while maintained in an active state by association with FAK , talin and PIPKI γ i2 ; and , integrins recycled to the cell surface rapidly reassemble new FAs owing to their active state andassociationwithFAK , talinandPIPKI γ i2 . Akeyimplicationofthis model is that integrins derived from disassembled FAs have ‘memory’ of their residence in FAs because they retain their activation state after FA disassembly and during endocytic recycling . The function of FAK ( and talin and PIPKI γ i2 ) in maintaining the activity of endocytosed integrin was unexpected . Previous studies reported either no eﬀect of FAK on integrin activation 53 , or enhanced integrin activation only during early stages of cell spreading 54 , but did not consider whether FAK aﬀected endocytosed integrin . We show that active FAK co - localized with endocytosed integrin in both Rab5 and Rab11 endosomes , suggesting that it may associate with integrin throughout its recycling . Another recent study reported FAK - pY397 in Rab5 endosomes and implicated it in integrin signalling to prevent anoikis in cancer cells 55 . Thus , canonical FA factors play roles in integrin signalling and activation at intracellular sites . OurresultsalsoshowthatSFKsplayacriticalroleintherecyclingof active integrin from the ERC to the cell surface . Given the localization of Src to the ERC and evidence for its role in FA reassembly 33 , we think that Src is the likely SFK involved in this recycling . Such a role is consistent with studies reporting localization of Src to perinuclear endosomes and regulation of its activity by endosomal membranes 37 – 39 , yet Src had not been known to regulate integrin recycling . Localization of Src in the ERC during integrin recycling , failure to restore surface integrin and accumulation of integrin in the ERC in SFK - inhibited cells , and slower reappearance of FAs after PP2 relative to PF228 washout , all support a role for Src in regulating integrin recycling from the ERC to the cell surface . Src has been implicated in the traﬃcking of fibroblast growth factor receptors , although in these cases it aﬀects internalization 56 , 57 . Curiously , we find that FAK is essential for FA reassembly , whereas previous studies using spreading assays do not report defects in FA assembly 58 , 59 . We suggest that these disparate results reflect a major diﬀerence in the source of the integrin in the two assays . In the MT - regrowth assay , FA reassembly depends specifically on recycled integrin , whereas in the spreading assay , cell detachment releases active integrins into the plasma membrane allowing them to engage the ECM during cell spreading . Given our data with migrating cells , we suggest that the FA reassembly pathway may be more relevant for migrating cells . Previous studies have also reported that FAK and Src inhibition lead to decreased FA disassembly rates in spreading cells 35 , 60 . Our data on migrating cells did not show significant diﬀerences in disassembly rates , but there was a trend towards slower disassembly . Nonetheless , despite potentially slower rates of disassembly in FAK - and SFK - inhibited cells , FAs still disassembled both in migrating cells and after NZ washout . Thus , FAK and SFKs may contribute to FA disassembly to a degree , but they are not absolutely required . Given earlier results showing that FAK scaﬀolding activity is important for FA disassembly 16 , 18 and our present data showing that FAK kinase activity is critical primarily for FA reassembly , we conclude that these two activities of FAK are separable . We found that there was little FN associated with active β 1 integrin in either the Rab5 or Rab11 compartments . Thus , integrin becomes separated from its ligand , either during FA disassembly or very soon after its endocytosis . In fact , when endocytosed with soluble FN , β 1 integrin is ubiquitylated and traﬃcked to lysosomes for degradation 61 . We note that for these experiments we used HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells , which have low levels of fibrillogenesis 62 , 63 , so it remains to be determined whether FN is internalized during FA disassembly in cells with more robust fibrillogenesis . Our results implicate the recycling of integrins from disassembled FAs in the polarized reassembly of FAs in the leading edge of migrating cells . To fully understand how this cycle is coupled to cell migration , it will be important to address new questions raised by our study , including how vesicles are traﬃcked from the Rab11 ERC to the cell surface and whether sites of recycled integrin exocytosis correspond to sites of FA reassembly . We identified FAK , talin and PIPKI γ i2 as components that maintain integrin in an active state during its endo - cytic recycling , raising the possibility that other FA components are involved . The system of synchronous FA disassembly and reassembly we have developed will be useful for exploring these questions .

PF - 228 FAK kinase inhibitor ( PF - 573228 ) was purchased from Tocris BioscienceandFAKkinaseinhibitorIwaspurchasedfromChemicon . Unlessstated otherwise , all other chemicals were from Sigma - Aldrich . NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts ( ATCC ) wereculturedinDMEM ( LifeTechnologies ) with10 % calfserum ( Gemini ) and 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) . For serum starvation , cells were grown to confluence onacid - washedcoverslips ( ∼ 2days ) andtransferredtoserum - freemedium ( DMEM and 10mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 ) for 48h as previously described 15 , 16 . FAK - null mouse embryonicfibroblasts ( fromD . Schlaepfer , UniversityofCalifornia , SanDiego , USA ) were cultured in DMEM and fetal bovine serum as previously described 59 . The human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 ( ATCC ) was grown in DMEM supplemented with10 % fetalbovineserumand10mMHEPES ( pH7 . 4 ) . Allcelllineswerecultured in 5 % CO 2 at 37 ◦ C . The cell lines used in this paper are not listed in the ICLAC database of commonly misidentified and cross - contamined cell lines . The cell lines were not directly tested for mycoplasm contamination but DAPI staining revealed no mycoplasm . ModelsystemtostudyFAturnoverandintegrinrecycling . FAdisassemblyandcell migration experiments were performed as previously described 15 , 16 . In brief , serum - starved NIH3T3 fibroblasts or HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells grown on glass coverslips were treated with 10 µ M NZ for 4h to completely depolymerize MTs . The drug was washed out with serum - free medium , and MTs were allowed to repolymerize for diﬀerent intervals . Cells were either fixed in − 20 ◦ C methanol for 5min and rehydrated in TBS or fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min , followed by permeabilization with 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 5min . After immunofluorescence staining ( see below ) , cells were analysed for FA number and FA area by background subtracting and thresholding images to isolate FAsignals ; FAsbelow1 µ m 2 werenotdistinguishablefromnoiseandwereexcluded . We initially used this method as our quantitative assay for FA reassembly ( for example , Fig . 1b ) . However , because of the large diﬀerences in FA reassembly in most experiments , we use a scoring assay in which cells with greater than 10 FAs were scored positive for FAs and those with fewer than 10 FAs were scored negative . Immunofluorescence staining . Depending on the experiment , cells were stained with antibodies against HA ( mouse monoclonal clone 16B12 ; 1 : 200 ; Covance , cat . no . 901501 ) , vinculin ( mouse monoclonal clone VIN - 11 - 5 ; 1 : 100 ; Sigma - Aldrich , cat . no .

AB16901 ) or Cy5 / rhodamine – phalloidin ( 1 : 200 ; Cytoskeleton , cat . no . PHDR1 ) . Secondary antibodies absorbed to minimize cross - reaction with other species were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories . Coverslips were mounted with Fluoromount - G ( Southern Biotech ) . Cell surface labelling and flow cytometry . Labelling of cell surface integrin was performed as described previously 15 . Briefly , cells were collected by trypsinization at time points after MT regrowth and washed in cold PCN ( 1 × PBS , 0 . 5 % calf serum , and 0 . 1 % NaN 3 ) . Approximately 1 × 10 6 cells per sample were stained at 4 ◦ C with PE - conjugated antibody to mouse α 5 integrin ( rat CD49e monoclonal , 1 : 100 ; BD Biosciences ) . After washes to remove unbound antibody , samples were fixed in cold 4 % paraformaldehyde / PCN , and the distribution and mean fluorescence intensity of each sample was quantified using a FACScan flow cytometer ( BD ) . The collected data were analysed using CellQuest software ( Becton Dickinson ) . Measurements of integrin activation . The activation state of endogenous surface α 5 β 1 integrin was assessed as described previously by measuring the binding of a recombinant soluble integrin - binding fragment of fibronectin containing the RGD - and the synergy - binding site for integrins ( GST – FN9 – 11 ; ref . 41 ) . This fragment was expressed in bacteria , purified and biotinylated as previously described 64 . Each preparation of biotinylated GST – FN9 – 11 was titrated to determine the concentrationthatwouldprovidealinearresponseinexperiments . Briefly , cellswere collected by a brief trypsinization , followed by neutralization with the addition of ice - cold , complete media . Following a brief centrifugation , cells were washed twice in ice - cold Tyrode’s buﬀer , suspended and incubated on ice with biotinylated GST FN9 – 11 for 30min . After washing , cells were incubated on ice for another 30min with Alexa Fluor 488 – streptavidin ( 10 µ gml − 1 ; Molecular Probes ) . After washing , the labelled cells were analysed on a FACScan flow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson ) . Transfection studies and plasmids .

GFP - tagged α 5 - integrin 67 was a gift from A . F . Horwitz ( University of Virginia , USA ) . GFP - tagged Rab5 Q79L , Rab5 S34N , Rab11 S25N and Rab11 WT constructs were gifts from J . Goldenring ( Vanderbilt University , USA ) . These constructs were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine Plus or Lipofectamine 2000 reagents ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and expressed for 24 – 48h before conducting FA disassembly assays . PIPKI γ i1 – GFP and PIPKI γ i2 – GFP constructs were a generous giftfromG . DiPaolo ( ColumbiaUniversity , USA ) andweresubclonedintoretroviral vectors ( pMSCV – puro ) and transduced into HT1080 cells by retroviral infection . For small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) knockdown experiments 21 - nucleotide RNA duplexes were purchased from Shanghai Gene Pharma ( Shanghai ) and resuspended in RNAase - free water at a concentration of 20 µ M . NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 40nM siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . siRNAs were designed on the basis of previously published sequences 68 as follows : Rab11a : 5 (cid:48) - AATGTCAGACAGACGTGAAAA - 3 (cid:48) , Rab11b : 5 (cid:48) - AAGCACTTGACATATGAGAAC - 3 (cid:48) .

HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells : smart - pool reagent ( a mixture of four oligonucleotides ) targeting phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase type - 1 gamma ( M004782 - 00 - 0005 ) and a scrambled control siRNA ( D - 001810 - 10 - 05 ) were purchased from Dharmacon . siRNA pools were transfected at a final concentration of 100nM ( single duplexes at 25nM ) into 50 % confluent cells grown on coverslips in normal growth medium without antibiotics using Lipofetamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) as recommended by the manufacturer . Integrin biotinylation and recycling . Surface biotinylation and detection of biotinylated α 5 integrin by capture enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) were performed essentially as described previously 29 with minor modifications . Briefly , cells were seeded on coverslips and serum starved for 48h . Following the starvation period , cells were incubated with NZ ( 10 µ M ) for 3h followed by one wash with cold PBS and incubation with 0 . 2mgml − 1 NHS – SS – biotin ( Pierce ) at 4 ◦ C for 30min . Labelled cells were then washed twice with PBS and incubated at 37 ◦ C for 60min to allow FA disassembly and integrin internalization . Next , cells were washed twice with cold PBS and biotin was removed from proteins remaining at thecell surface byincubation with asolution containing 20mM MesNa in50mM Tris ( pH 8 . 6 ) and 100mM NaCl for 15min at 4 ◦ C . MesNa was quenched by the addition of 20mM iodoacetamide ( IAA ) for 10min , and internalized biotinylated proteins were chased by returning the cells to the incubator for diﬀerent lengths of time . At the desired time points , cells were washed twice with cold PBS and biotin from recycled proteins was removed by a second reduction with 20mM MesNa for 15min at 4 ◦ C . Cells were lysed in 200mM NaCl , 75mM Tris , 7 . 5mM EDTA , 7 . 5mM EGTA , 1 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 75 % Igepal CA - 630 and protease and phosphatase inhibitors ( 1mM ) . Lysates were passed three times through a 27G needleandwereclarifiedbycentrifugationat10 , 000 g for10min . Supernatantswere corrected to equivalent protein concentrations and levels of biotinylated integrin were determined by capture - ELISA . Capture - ELISA . Maxisorb 96 - well plates ( Life Technologies ) were coated overnight with 5 µ g of monoclonal rat anti - mouse α 5 integrin ( 5H10 - 27 [ MFR5 ] ) in 0 . 05M Na 2 CO 3 ( pH9 . 6 ) at4 ◦ CandwereblockedinPBScontaining0 . 05 % Tween - 20 ( PBS - T ) with 5 % BSA for 1h at room temperature . Integrins were captured by overnight incubation of 100 µ l cell lysate ( 25 µ gml − 1 ) at 4 ◦ C .

Allimageswerecapturedwithacamera ( Andor iXon3 888 , back - illuminated EMCCD ) controlled by NIS elements software . Image quantification . All images were background - subtracted before performing measurements . To analyse the α 5 integrin – GFP signal in the ERC after FA disassembly , we first defined a region of interest ( ROI ) highlighting the ERC ( assessedbystainingofendogenousRab11 ) . The α 5 integrin – GFPsummedintensity in the ERC was measured and divided by the total - cell summed intensity to normalize for the level of α 5 integrin – GFP expression . To analyse active integrin , FN and talin signals in the ERC after FA disassembly , weusedthestainingofendogenousRab11todefineaROIfortheERC . Wemeasured thesummedintensityofthesignalfromthe12G10antibody ( active β 1 integrin ) , the FNantibodyorthetalinantibodywithinthisERCROI . Theactive - integrinsummed intensity was then divided by the ROI area drawn for each measurement . ToanalysetheactiveintegrinsignalintheRab5endosomesafterFAdisassembly , HT1080 cells were transfected with constitutively active Rab5 ( Rab5 Q79L ) . We measured the summed intensity of the signal from the 12G10 antibody to active β 1 integrin colocalizing with the Rab5 endosomes ( assessed by GFP staining ) . To measure FA assembly and disassembly rates during wound healing , we used NIH3T3 fibroblasts stably expressing EGFP – paxillin and imaged them under TIRF microscopy as described above . We defined ROIs at the cell leading edge where most of the FAs were concentrated and measured the summed intensity in the GFP channel during migration of cells treated with the drugs ( PF228 and PP2 ) and after drug washout . We also measured the disassembly rate of individual FAs . In this case , each FA was highlighted to define individual ROIs and the summed intensity measuredovertime . ThesumintensityvaluesforeachFAwerethendividedbytheir individual ROI area . Cell adhesion assay . Cells were trypsinized with 0 . 05 % trypsin and 2mM EDTA in PBS ( 2 . 5min at 37 ◦ C ) . Trypsin was inactivated by the addition of 0 . 25mgml − 1 soybeantrypsininhibitorinPBS . Cellswerecollectedbycentrifugation , resuspended in migration medium ( DME with 0 . 5 % BSA ) and held in suspension at 37 ◦ C for 30min . Acid - washed glass coverslips were coated overnight at 4 ◦ C with FN ( 1 or 2 . 5 µ gml − 1 in PBS ) , blocked with 1 % BSA in PBS for 30min , and equilibrated at 37 ◦ C before use . Cells were allowed to adhere to FN - coated coverslips for 15min , stained with DAPI and then the number of nuclei per field was assessed . Cell migration experiments . Cells were plated at a subconfluent density ( 75 % ) on glass - bottom dishes and 24h later growth medium was replaced by DMEM supplemented with 0 . 5 % calf serum . The following day , cell monolayers were wounded with a pipette tip and incubated in DMEM containing 2 % calf serum and the desired inhibitors . DIC images were acquired using an inverted microscope ( TE2000 - U ; Nikon ) with a 60 × NA 1 . 45 Plan Apochromat objective and with a camera ( Andor iXon3 888 , back - illuminated EMCCD ) controlled by NIS elements software . For random cell migration experiments , cells were seeded at low confluency and allowed to spread on FN - coated coverslips ( 5 µ gml − 1 ) for 4h . Following spreading , either vehicle ( DMSO ) or FAK inhibitor ( PF228 , 10 µ M ) was added to the medium for diﬀerent intervals before fixing the cells for immunofluorescence .
