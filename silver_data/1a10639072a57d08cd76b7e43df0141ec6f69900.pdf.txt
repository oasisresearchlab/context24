Chlorotoxin is a 36 - amino acid peptide derived from Leiurus quinquestriatus ( scorpion ) venom , which has been shown to inhibit low - conductance chloride channels in colonic epithelial cells . Chlorotoxin also binds to matrix metalloproteinase - 2 and other proteins on glioma cell surfaces . Glioma cells are considered to require the activation of matrix metalloproteinase - 2 during invasion and migration . In this study , for targeting glioma , we designed two types of recombinant chlorotoxin fused to human IgG - Fcs with / without a hinge region . Chlorotoxin fused to IgG - Fcs was designed as a dimer of 60 kDa with a hinge region and a monomer of 30kDa without a hinge region . The monomeric and dimeric forms of chlorotoxin inhibited cell proliferation at 300nM and induced internalization in human glioma A172 cells . The monomer had a greater inhibitory e ﬀ ect than the dimer ; therefore , monomeric chlorotoxin fused to IgG - Fc was multivalently displayed on the surface of bionanocapsules to develop a drug delivery system that targeted matrix metalloproteinase - 2 . The target - dependent internalization of bionanocapsules in A172 cells was observed when chlorotoxin was displayed on the bionanocapsules . This study indicates that chlorotoxin fused to IgG - Fcs could be useful for the active targeting of glioblastoma cells . 1 . Introduction Glioblastoma is one of the most malignant and consistently fatal brain cancers in adults . Treatment of glioma remains a challenge largely because of its rapid growth rate and the highly invasive nature of this disease , despite incremental advances in surgical and radiation therapies [ 1 ] . Glioma cells are considered to require the activation of matrix met - alloproteinase ( MMP ) - 2 , which degrades the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) during invasion and migration [ 2 , 3 ] . In the central nervous system , membrane type MMP - 1 ( MT1 - MMP ) has a more important role than MMP - 2 during ECM remodeling , migration , inﬁltration , and invasion of gliomas [ 4 ] . MT1 - MMP on cell surfaces is replenished by autodegradation or clathrin - dependent internalization , and its concentration is stabilized by the tissue inhibitor of MMP ( TIMP ) - 2 [ 5 , 6 ] . Malignant human gliomas express membrane - anchored MMPs and their endogenous TIMPs [ 7 – 10 ] . Many MMP inhibitors have been developed for human clinical trials , but e ﬀ ective candidates have not been obtained [ 10 , 11 ] . Chlorotoxin ( CTX ) is a 36 - amino acid peptide with four disulﬁde bridges and is derived from Leiurus quinques - triatus ( scorpion ) venom . CTX has been shown to inhibit low - conductance chloride channels in colonic epithelial cells [ 12 ] . Several experiments have used CTX to target brain tumors , exploiting its binding a ﬃ nity to the glioma - speciﬁc chloride ion channel complex , MMP - 2 , and other 2 Journal of Drug Delivery proteins [ 13 , 14 ] . Recently , a conjugate of CTX and ﬂu - orescent dye was demonstrated to target brain tumors by visualizing cancer foci in vivo [ 15 , 16 ] . Bionanocapsules ( BNCs ) are artiﬁcial hollow nanopar - ticles composed of the recombinant envelope L protein of hepatitis B virus , which has a speciﬁc a ﬃ nity for human hepatocytes [ 17 , 18 ] . To confer BNCs a high a ﬃ nity for the IgG - Fc domain , the pre - S1 region of L protein was replaced with the ZZ motif in protein A derived from Staphylococcus aureus [ 19 , 20 ] . BNCs displaying anti - human EGFR monoclonal antibodies were delivered successfully to glioma cells in a mouse model of brain tumors [ 19 ] . EGFR is expressed not only in tumors but also in normal epithelia ; therefore , it may not always be feasible to target brain tumors with EGFR . Thus , we designed a CTX peptide fused to the human IgG - Fc domain ( CTX - Fc ) in this study to establish a more e ﬃ cient and speciﬁc targeting vehicle for glioblastoma cells . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Cell Culture . A human cell line derived from glioblas - toma , A172 ( RCB2530 ) , was provided by RIKEN BRC through the National BioResource Project of MEXT , Japan . Glioma cells were grown and subcultured in RPMI medium ( Sigma - Aldrich , St Louis , MO , USA ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , PAA Laboratories , Pasching , Austria ) in the presence of 100 IU / mL penicillin and 100 μ g / mL streptomycin ( Nacalai Tesque , Kyoto , Japan ) . The cells were maintained at 37 ◦ C in a humidiﬁed incubator with 95 % air and 5 % CO 2 . 2 . 2 . Construction of Expression Plasmids . The expression plasmids for CTX fused to human IgG - Fcs ( CTX - Fcs ) were constructed as follows . An oligonucleotide coding for the CTX peptide was synthesized by Operon Biotechnologies ( Tokyo , Japan ) and cloned into pET28b ( Novagen , Darm - stadt , Germany ) . The DNA fragment coding human IgG - Fcs was excised from the plasmid pBO593 ( coding with a hinge domain ) and pBO807 ( coding without a hinge domain , [ 20 , 21 ] ) using the restriction endonucleases , AgeI and NotI , and then ligated to the 3 (cid:3) - end of the CTX coding sequence downstream of a T7 promoter to code a dimeric form of CTX - Fc ( D - CTX - Fc ) and a monomeric form of CTX - Fc ( M - CTX - Fc ) , respectively . 2 . 3 . Expression and Puriﬁcation of M / D - CTX - Fcs . Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS ( Novagen ) was transformed with expression vectors for M / D - CTX - Fcs . Transformants were grown in 1 L of LB medium containing 50 μ g / mL kanamycin and 10 μ g / mL chloramphenicol at 37 ◦ C . Protein expression was induced by 0 . 4 mM isopropyl 1 - thio - β - D - galactopyranoside . After expression induction , the transformants were cultured at 25 ◦ C for 16 h , and the bacteria were harvested . Cell pellets were thawed and homogenized in 20 mL of lysis bu ﬀ er containing 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 10 mM EDTA , 0 . 2 M NaCl , and 10 % sucrose . The inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation at 12 , 000 × g for 20 min . The inclusion bodies were washed three times with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 . The insoluble fraction was resolved in 4 mL of 6 M guanidinium HCl containing 0 . 1 M Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 5 ) . The solution was degassed by aspiration while purging the air with nitrogen gas and supplemented with 50 μ L of 2 - mercaptoethanol . After 1 h incubation at 37 ◦ C in a shaking water bath , the mixture was dispersed into a 20 - fold volume of refolding bu ﬀ er containing 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 5 ) , 0 . 1 M NaCl , and 0 . 5 mM oxidized glutathione . Refolding was conducted by incubation at 4 ◦ C for 18 h . The pH was then adjusted to 7 . 0 using acetic acid . Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 12 , 000 × g for 20 min . The solution containing refolded protein was applied to a cobalt resin column ( TALON superﬂow metal a ﬃ nity resin , Clontech , Mountain View , CA , USA ) , after equilibrating with equilibration bu ﬀ er containing 50 mM phosphate bu ﬀ er ( pH 7 . 0 ) and 300 mM NaCl . The column was then washed with equilibration bu ﬀ er containing 20 mM imidazole and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . M / D - CTX - Fcs were eluted with elution bu ﬀ er containing 50 mM phosphate bu ﬀ er ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 300 mM imidazole , and 300 mM NaCl . The eluted solution was dialyzed three times against phosphate - bu ﬀ ered saline ( Dulbecco’s formula , hereafter PBS ) for 2 h each time . The purity of M / D - CTX - Fcs in the ﬁnal preparations was assessed by SDS - PAGE , Coomassie Brilliant Blue ( CBB ) staining , and western blotting . 2 . 4 . Preparation of CTX - Fc - BNCs . We mixed 2 nM ( 10 μ g / mL ) ZZ - tagged bionanocapsules ( ZZ - BNCs ) [ 19 ] with M - CTX - Fc or human IgG ( Sigma - Aldrich ) at a ratio of 1 : 20 and incubated them at 4 ◦ C for 1 h in PBS . The precipitates were removed by centrifugation at 12 , 000 × g for 5 min . 2 . 5 . Enzyme Immunoassay on Cell Surfaces . The enzyme immunoassay ( EIA ) was designed to evaluate the binding ability of CTX - Fcs to A172 cell surfaces . Each well of a 96 - well plate ( Greiner Bio - One , Frickenhausen , Germany ) was coated with 10 % skim milk ( Wako Pure Chemical Industries , Osaka , Japan ) in PBS at 25 ◦ C for 1 h and washed with PBS . Five thousand A172 cells / well were seeded in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % FBS , 100 IU / mL penicillin , and 100 μ g / mL streptomycin . After 20 h of culture , the cells were washed three times with PBS and ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS . The cells were washed three times with PBS , covered with 10 % skim milk in PBS at 25 ◦ C for 1 h , and then washed three times with PBS . The cells were incubated with M / D - CTX - Fcs in a range of 0 – 400 nM in PBS at 25 ◦ C for 1 h . The cells were then washed with PBS containing 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ( PBST ) , before adding 100 μ L of protein A conjugated to horse radish peroxidase ( HRP ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , diluted to 1 : 500 , and incubated at 25 ◦ C for 1 h . The wells were washed three times with PBST , and 100 μ L 3 , 3 (cid:3) , 5 , 5 (cid:3) - tetramethylbenzidine ( TMB ) Liquid Substrate System ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was added to test the peroxidase reaction . After 5 min , the reaction was quenched with 50 μ L of 0 . 5 M sulfuric acid , and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured in each well using a microplate reader Journal of Drug Delivery 3 ( SH - 9000 ; Corona Electric , Ibaraki , Japan ) . Each experiment was performed in triplicate , and the mean values and standard deviations were calculated . 2 . 6 . Wound Healing Assay . Thirty thousand A172 cells were seeded into a 24 - well plate in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % FBS , 100 IU / mL penicillin , and 100 μ g / mL strep - tomycin . After 20 h incubation , each conﬂuent monolayer was scratched using a 200 μ L plastic pipette tip to create a wounded cell - free area and washed with RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % FBS . The cells were incubated at 37 ◦ C with M / D - CTX - Fcs in a range of 0 – 300 nM in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % FBS , 100 IU / mL penicillin , and 100 μ g / mL streptomycin and photographed at 0 and 12 h using an inverted microscope CKX41 ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) . The digital images were acquired with a digital camera U - CMDA3 ( Olympus ) using the imaging program DP2 - BSW ( Olympus ) . The distances between the edges of cell - free areas were measured using NIH Image J . The migration length was deﬁned as the change in the distance between 0 and 12 h , which was normalized by the change in the absence of the stimulant . 2 . 7 . Cell Migration Assay . The migration of A172 cells was assayed in 24 - well plates with 8 μ m pore cell culture inserts ( BD , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ) . Five hundred microliters of RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % FBS were added to each well , and 3 × 10 4 cells were seeded into each insert . The cells were incubated with M / D - CTX - Fcs in a range of 0 – 300 nM in RPMI medium supplemented with 1 % BSA at 37 ◦ C . After 48 h of culture , the insert chambers were removed , and adherent cells on the bottom of each well were counted . The number of migrated cells was normalized by the number of adherent cells in the absence of CTX - Fcs . 2 . 8 . Cell Proliferation Assay . The inhibition of cell growth by M / D - CTX - Fcs was evaluated using a 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthia - zol - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) cleavage assay with A172 cells . The cells were seeded at 5 × 10 3 cells / well in 96 - well plates in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % FBS . After 20 h of culture , M / D - CTX - Fcs in a range of 0 – 300 nM were added in triplicate , and the cells were further cultured for 48 h . The cells were then exposed to 5 mg / mL MTT in PBS at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mg / mL in culture for 5 h . Formazan crystals formed during the incubation period were dissolved overnight at 37 ◦ C by adding 10 % SDS containing 20 mM HCl . The absorbance was measured at 570 nm . To assess the viability of cells treated with CTX after 48 h incubation with di ﬀ erent concentrations of CTX , the wells were washed twice with RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % FBS . The cells were further incubated for 24 h in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % FBS . The viable cells were evaluated using the MTT cleavage assay , as described above . 2 . 9 . Confocal Microscopic Observation . For confocal micro - scopic observation , A172 cells were grown on 18 mm cover slips ( Iwaki , Tokyo , Japan ) in 12 - well plates . The cells were incubated with 30 nM M / D - CTX - Fcs or 30 nM human IgG - Fc domain [ 20 ] in PBS containing 1 % BSA for 15 min or 1 h at 4 ◦ C or 37 ◦ C . The cells were washed twice with PBS to evaluate speciﬁc binding to cell surfaces . The cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS , permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , and blocked with blocking solution containing 10 % FBS or 1 % BSA in PBS . The cells were washed with PBS and incubated with anti - early endosome antigen - 1 ( EEA - 1 ) antibody ( Cell Signaling Technology , Beverly , MA , USA ) for 1 h at 25 ◦ C followed by Alexa 555 - labelled anti - rabbit IgG ( Molecular Probes Inc . , Eugene , OR , USA ) for 30 min at 25 ◦ C . The cells were washed with PBS and incubated with FITC - labeled anti - human IgG - Fc antibody ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 30 min at 25 ◦ C . After further washes , the nuclei were stained with DAPI ( Vector Laboratories Inc . , Burlingame , CA , USA ) , and the cells were visualized using a confocal microscope IX81 ( Olympus ) with Fluoview FV - 1000 ( Olympus ) . To observe the binding of BNCs on cells , the cells were incubated with CTX - Fc - BNCs at 37 ◦ C for 1 h . The speciﬁc binding of CTX - Fcs was further assessed by competition with a CTX ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . In the competitive assay , the cells were incubated primarily with 300 nM CTX in 1 % BSA - PBS at 4 ◦ C for 20 min , followed by incubation with CTX - Fc - BNCs in the presence of 300 nM CTX at 37 ◦ C for 1 h . The cells were washed with PBS and ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS , permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , and blocked with blocking bu ﬀ er . The cells were washed with PBS and incubated with anti - human IgG - Fc antibody labeled with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 1 h at 25 ◦ C . After further washes , the cells were visualized using a confocal microscope LSM 510 Meta ( Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) equipped with an argon laser having an excitation laser line of 488 nm coupled with a bandpass ﬁlter of 505 nm . 2 . 10 . Assessment of Internalization of CTX - Fc - BNCs . Cellular uptake of CTX - Fc - BNCs was evaluated . A172 cells in 60 - mm dishes were washed three times with ice - cold PBS and incubated with 2 nM ( 10 μ g / mL ) of CTX - Fc - BNCs , human IgG - BNCs , or M - CTX - Fc for 1 h at 4 ◦ C or 37 ◦ C . After incubation , the cells were washed three times with ice - cold PBS to remove unbounded BNCs and were collected by treatment with 0 . 025 % trypsin . After centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min , the supernatant was discarded , and the cell pellet was washed three times with ice - cold PBS . The cells were then lysed in lysis bu ﬀ er , incubated for 20 min on ice , and sonicated twice . The extracts were clariﬁed by centrifugation at 12 , 000 × g for 5 min at 4 ◦ C . Twenty microliters of anti - HBsAg microbead suspension were added to the extracts , and this mixture was incubated overnight at 4 ◦ C . After centrifugation at 12 , 000 × g for 30 s at 4 ◦ C , the beads were washed three times in PBS , suspended in Laemmli bu ﬀ er supplemented with β - mercaptoethanol , heated for 5 min at 95 ◦ C , and subjected to SDS - PAGE followed by western blotting . 2 . 11 . Western Blotting and Image Analysis . Proteins resolved on SDS - PAGE were transferred to a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride ( PVDF ) membrane ( Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) . The membrane was blocked with 10 % skim milk in 10 mM 4 Journal of Drug Delivery CTX - Fc - BNC M - CTX - Fc D - CTX - Fc Extracellular space MT1 - MMP Cytoplasmic space Cl − M - CTX - F Extracellu C t l Cl − MMP - 2 ( a ) M - CTX - Fc D - CTX - Fc + − + − + − ( kDa ) 60 30 ( kDa ) 60 30 WB CBB ( kDa ) 60 30 β - ME ( b ) Figure 1 : Design and preparation of M / D - CTX - Fcs .

The blots were probed with anti - human IgG mouse monoclonal antibody conjugated with HRP ( Life technologies , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) diluted to 1 : 500 in TBST containing 10 % skim milk . The HRP signal was developed using a Western Lightning Plus - ECL chemiluminescence reagent ( PerkinElmer , Waltham , MA , USA ) , and the inten - sities of the bands were visualized using a Light - Capture II cooled CCD camera system ( ATTO , Tokyo , Japan ) . The relative intensities of the blots were quantitatively analyzed using NIH Image J . 2 . 12 . Statistical Analysis . The results were expressed as means ± standard deviations from at least three independent experiments . The data were analyzed using Student’s t - test . P < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Preparation of M / D - CTX - Fcs . Schematic representa - tions of M / D - CTX - Fcs and ZZ - BNCs displaying M - CTX - Fcs are shown in Figure 1 ( a ) . The His - tagged CTX - Fc fusion protein was designed as a CTX peptide fused to the amino terminus of the human IgG - Fc domain with / without a hinge domain . The CTX - Fcs expressed in E . coli were observed as monomers of approximately 30 kDa under the reducing condition , whereas CTX - Fcs with a hinge domain were observed as dimers of approximately 60 kDa under the nonreducing condition , which was conﬁrmed using CBB staining or western blotting ( Figure 1 ( b ) ) . 3 . 2 . Intracellular Localization of M / D - CTX - Fcs in A172 Cells . Because of the high expression levels of MMP - 2 [ 22 ] , we evaluated the binding capabilities of M / D - CTX - Fcs on the surface of A172 glioblastoma cells . When the cells were incubated with M / D - CTX - Fcs at 4 ◦ C , the ﬂuorescence from anti - human IgG labeled with FITC indicated the localization of the fused proteins on the plasma membrane . However , when the cells were incubated at 37 ◦ C , the ﬂuorescence indicated that M / D - CTX - Fcs were localized intracellularly in A172 cells ( Figure 2 ( a ) ) . In contrast , the human IgG - Fc domain without a CTX domain produced no ﬂuorescence at 4 ◦ C or 37 ◦ C indicating the speciﬁc binding of the CTX moiety to A172 cell surfaces ( see Figure S1 in Supplementary Materials available online at doi : 10 . 1155 / 2012 / 975763 ) . We quantitatively evaluated the cell surface binding a ﬃ nity by assaying sequentially diluted M / D - CTX - Fcs using the A172 cells ﬁxed in EIA plates . The results showed that M - CTX - Fc had a higher a ﬃ nity than D - CTX - Fc and that 100 nM of M - CTX - Fc saturated the binding ( Figure 2 ( b ) ) . 3 . 3 . E ﬀ ect of M / D - CTX - Fcs on the Migration of A172 Cells . The e ﬀ ect of M / D - CTX - Fcs on the migration of A172 cells was assessed ( Figure 3 ( a ) ) . Although M - , D - CTX - Fcs , and CTX at a concentration of 300 nM signiﬁcantly inhibited the migration of the cells , M - CTX - Fc exhibited the inhibition clearly depending on the concentration . In the wound healing assay , the e ﬀ ect of inhibition by both M - and D - CTX - Fcs appeared to be dose dependent in the range of 3 – 300 nM ( Figure 3 ( b ) ) . The results showed that M - CTX - Fc had a more e ﬃ cient inhibitory e ﬀ ect than D - CTX - Fc . We then evaluated the e ﬀ ects of M / D - CTX - Fcs on the proliferation and viability of A172 cells . M - CTX - Fc strongly suppressed the cell viability compared with D - CTX - Fc and CTX ( Figure 4 ( a ) ) . IC 50 was estimated at around 100 nM . After treatment with 300 nM M / D - CTX - Fcs for 48 h , the growth of cells resumed in the next 24 h when the medium Journal of Drug Delivery 5 M M D D 4 ◦ C 37 ◦ C ( a ) 3 2 . 5 2 1 . 5 1 0 . 5 0 0 100 200 300 400 A b s o r b a n c e a t 450 n M CTX concentration ( nM ) M - CTX - Fc D - CTX - Fc ( b ) Figure 2 : Immunoﬂuorescence image and binding assay for M / D - CTX - Fcs using A172 cells . ( a ) The M / D - CTX - Fcs attached to cell surfaces at 4 ◦ C ( upper ) . Fifteen minutes incubation at 37 ◦ C promoted the internalization of M / D - CTX - Fcs into cells ( lower ) . The cells were stained with anti - human IgG antibody labeled with FITC , anti - EEA1 antibody and anti - rabbit IgG antibody labeled with alexa - 555 , and DAPI .

A172 cells were ﬁxed on EIA plates and exposed to M / D - CTX - Fcs . The a ﬃ nity of M - CTX - Fc for cell surfaces was higher than that of D - CTX - Fc . was replaced with a medium without M / D - CTX - Fcs or CTX ( Figure 4 ( b ) ) . 3 . 4 . Internalization of CTX - Fc - BNCs . The M - CTX - Fc was multivalently displayed on the surface of ZZ - BNCs , thereby exploiting the a ﬃ nity of the ZZ peptide for the IgG - Fc region [ 20 ] . CTX - Fc - BNCs ( 2 nM , 10 μ g / mL ) were incubated with A172 cells at 37 ◦ C for 1 h , and the speciﬁc binding of CTX - Fc - BNCs was observed competing with free CTX ( Figure 5 ( a ) ) . To evaluate the internalization of CTX - Fc - BNCs , the cells were incubated with M - CTX - Fc , human IgG - BNCs , or CTX - Fc - BNCs at 37 ◦ C or 4 ◦ C . The incubation of cells at 37 ◦ C facilitated the intracellular localization of BNCs , indicating that the temperature - dependent internalization was attributable to a membrane - dependent mechanism ( Figures 5 ( b ) and 5 ( c ) ) . The mechanism of uptake of CTX - Fc - BNCs was assessed in A172 cells using endocytotic pathway inhibitors ( Figure 6 ) . To determine the e ﬀ ective concentration of CPZ , the cells were incubated with 2 nM of CTX - Fc - BNCs and CPZ in the range of 0 – 100 nM ( Vaidyanath et al . 2011 [ 20 ] , Figure S2 ) . One hundred nanomolar of CPZ e ﬀ ectively inhibited the internalization of CTX - Fc - BNCs in A172 cells . The cells were treated with CPZ , an amphiphilic drug that inhibits the clathrin - mediated pathway , and the internalization of CTX - Fc - BNCs was reduced to the same level as that of human IgG - BNCs . 4 .

Cell numbers in each well were assessed by MTT assay . The absorbance at 570 nm corresponding to the initial number of the cells was deﬁned as 1 . MT1 - MMP mediates proteolysis and activates the precursor of MMP - 2 ( pro - MMP - 2 ) , which localizes on the cell surface , and these events occur at the invasive edge of tumor cell nests [ 6 , 23 , 24 ] . Most MMPs have a hemopexin C - terminal domain ( C domain ) , which is linked to the C terminus of the catalytic domain via a ﬂexible proline - rich linker peptide [ 25 – 27 ] . It is considered that MMP - 2 contributes to migration , invasion , translocation , and malignancy . In glioma cells , it was reported that CTX inhibits cell invasion by reducing MMP2 activity [ 13 ] . In addition , MMP - 2 is associated with cell signaling by binding to integrins directly . The proteolytically activated form of the C terminus of MMP - 2 can bind integrins on melanoma cells and blood vessels [ 28 ] . An angiogenic regulator , angiopoietin 2 , induces invasion by stimulating MMP - 2 expression and secretion in glioma cells [ 29 ] . In cancer , MMPs , such as MMP - 2 and MT1 - MMP , associate with tumor growth , tissue remodeling , tissue invasion , and metastasis . We designed and puriﬁed M / D - CTX - Fcs ( Figure 1 ) . M / D - CTX - Fcs were attached to A172 cell surfaces , and they localized intracellularly at 37 ◦ C ( Figure 2 ) . Furthermore , M / D - CTX - Fcs inhibited cell migration and proliferation in a dose - dependent manner ( Figures 3 and 4 ) .

( a ) A172 cells were incubated with CTX - Fc - BNCs at 37 ◦ C . In “CTX competition” , the cells were treated primarily with CTX at 4 ◦ C for 20 min before incubating with CTX - Fc - BNCs . The cells were stained with anti - human IgG antibody labeled with FITC . Left : ﬂuorescence image ; right ; composite image . Bars = 10 μ m . ( b ) and ( c ) A172 cells were treated with CTX - Fc - BNCs , human IgG - BNCs , or M - CTX - Fc for 1 h at 4 ◦ C or 37 ◦ C . After incubation , the cells were trypsinized . The cytoplasmic fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti - HBsAg antibody conjugated to microbeads . ( b ) The precipitates were immunoblotted and detected with anti - human - IgG - Fc antibody .

The data ( mean ± S . D ) presented are from three independent experiments ( ∗∗ P < 0 . 05 ) . toxic to the cells ( Figure 4 ( b ) ) . These ﬁndings suggest that M / D - CTX - Fcs may be a potential ligand for the active targeting of glioblastoma cells . Several MMPs are considered to regulate signaling pathways in cells [ 30 ] . MT1 - MMP inﬂuences the cellular microenvironment and promotes cell invasion via degra - dation of ECM , shedding of CD44 and syndecan1 , and activation of ERK , Akt , and FAK signaling [ 31 , 32 ] . MT1 - MMP is internalized , and like other membrane - binding molecules , it is regulated by endocytosis because of the functional role of internalization in the cytoplasmic tail [ 33 ] . The regulation of the activity and internalization of MT1 - MMP are associated with integrin on endothelial cells [ 34 ] . Endocytosis and accumulation of MT1 - MMP are mediated by the clathrin - dependent endocytic pathway [ 33 ] . CTX - Fc - BNCs were localized intracellularly at 37 ◦ C ( Figure 5 ) , which was inhibited by 100 nM CPZ , a blocker of clathrin - coated pit formation [ 21 ] , and by 5 mM m β CD ( Figure 6 ) , 8 Journal of Drug Delivery CTX - Fc - BNCs Human IgG - BNCs U n t r e a t e d C P Z M β C D U n t r e a t e d C P Z M β C D ( a ) CTX - Fc - BNCs Human IgG - BNCs ∗∗ 1 . 2 1 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 U CP M β R e l a t i v e s i g n a l i n t e n s i t y ∗∗ U CP M β ( b ) Figure 6 : Assessment of the mechanism of CTX - Fc - BNCs internalization . A172 cells were treated with CTX - Fc - BNCs or human IgG - BNCs in the presence of 100nM CPZ or 5mM M β CD at 37 ◦ C for 1h , followed by trypsinization . The cytoplasmic fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti - HBsAg antibody conjugated to microbeads . “Untreated” indicates that the cells were treated with CTX - Fc - BNCs in the absence of any inhibitors . ( a ) The precipitates were immunoblotted and detected using anti - human - IgG - Fc antibody .

The data ( mean ± S . D ) presented are from three independent experiments ( ∗∗ P < 0 . 05 ) . a cholesterol - dislodging oligosaccharide that inhibits caveo - lar formation and perturbs clathrin - coated endocytic vesicles [ 35 , 36 ] . Because 300 nM CTX signiﬁcantly reduced the green ﬂuorescence of BNCs by competing with CTX - Fc - BNCs ( Figure 5 ( a ) ) , CTX - Fc - BNCs binding on A172 cell surfaces should be speciﬁc to the CTX - binding site such as MMP - 2 and MT1 - MMP . The internalization of CTX - Fc - BNCs was shown to be temperature dependent ( Figure 5 ( b ) ) . This suggests that cellular uptake of CTX - Fc - BNCs was receptor mediated . Zhang et al . reported that CTX was displayed on polyethylene glycol ( PEG - ) coated iron oxide nanoparticles that were detectable in the tumor lesions of mouse and rat glioma models . They demonstrated the active targeting of glioma cells using a combination of CTX and supermagnetic or ﬂuorescent compounds in vivo and in vitro [ 37 – 40 ] . CTX - displaying nanoparticles were able to pass the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) or the blood - tumor barrier ( BTB ) after intravenous injection and accumulated in brain tumors [ 38 , 41 ] . Many methods , such as intratumoral injection , intracavity injection , microdialysis , biodegradable polymers , and enhanced convection , have been used for local drug delivery to brain tumors [ 42 ] . Given the characteristic features of CTX - Fc - BNCs , the targeted intravenous injection of brain tumors with nanodrugs displaying CTX - Fcs should alleviate painful side e ﬀ ects in patients . 5 . Conclusions We designed a fusion protein between CTX and human IgG - Fcs . Depending on the presence of hinge region of Fc domain , the fusion protein exists as a monomer or a dimmer . The monomeric form , M - CTX - Fc , performed as an active targeting ligand to suppress the motility of A172 glioblastoma cells . We then constructed a protein nanocapsule displaying M - CTX - Fc as CTX - Fc - BNCs , which showed speciﬁc a ﬃ nity to the surface of A172 cells and internalized into the cytoplasmic space . This internalization depended on the clathrin - mediated endocytosis pathway . Thus the internalization was enhanced by the multivalent display of the ligand on nanocapsules , which should be a promising drug delivery system for targeting glioblastoma when an appropriate anticancer agent is loaded .
