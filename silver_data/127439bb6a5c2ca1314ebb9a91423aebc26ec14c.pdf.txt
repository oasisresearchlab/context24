We report here that FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 are expressed in mouse cochlear sensory hair cells . FCHSD1 mainly localizes to the cuticular plate , whereas FCHSD2 mainly localizes along the stereocilia in a punctuate pattern . Nervous Wreck ( Nwk ) , the Drosophila ortholog of FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 , has been shown to bind Wsp and play an important role in F - actin assembly . We show that , like its Drosophila counterpart , FCHSD2 interacts with WASP and N - WASP , the mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Wsp , and stimulates F - actin assembly in vitro . In contrast , FCHSD1 doesn’t bind WASP or N - WASP , and can’t stimulate F - actin assembly when tested in vitro . We found , however , that FCHSD1 binds via its F - BAR domain to the SH3 domain of Sorting Nexin 9 ( SNX9 ) , a well characterized BAR protein that has been shown to promote WASP - Arp2 / 3 - dependent F - actin polymerization . FCHSD1 greatly enhances SNX9’s WASP - Arp2 / 3 - dependent F - actin polymerization activity . In hair cells , SNX9 was detected in the cuticular plate , where it colocalizes with FCHSD1 . Our results suggest that FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 could modulate F - actin assembly or maintenance in hair cell stereocilia and cuticular plate . Citation : Cao H , Yin X , Cao Y , Jin Y , Wang S , et al .

Introduction Inner ear hair cells are auditory and vestibular receptor cells , responsible for converting mechanical stimuli into electrical signals in a process called mechanoelectrical transduction . They feature F - actin - based , microvilli - like protrusions on their apical surface , named stereocilia , which are organized into several rows of increasing heights . Mechanoelectrical transduction happens near the tips of middle and short rows of stereocilia [ 1 ] . In each stereocilium , several hundred cross - linked parallel actin filaments form a rigid paracrystalline array . The stereocilia have rootlets that are inserted into a dense filamentous actin network , the cuticular plate , which occupies the apical cell cytoplasm and serves as an anchor for stereocilia [ 2 , 3 ] . There are several types of extracellular links among stereocilia , including tip - links , top - connectors , lateral - links , ankle - links , and kinociliary - links . By connecting stereocilia with each other and with the microtubule - based kinocilium , these links play impor - tant roles in maintaining stereociliary integrity and stability and some of them are directly involved in the transduction process [ 4 , 5 ] . Stereociliary F - actin is polarized , with the barbed ( plus ) ends at the tips and the pointed ( minus ) ends at the base . During development , stereociliary F - actin experiences turnover . In a process called tread - milling , actin monomers join the barbed end of the filament and depart the filament from the pointed end [ 6 , 7 ] . Recently , Zhang and colleagues measured the turnover of stereociliary protein using multi - isotope mass spectrometry ( MIMS ) imaging and found that mature stereocilia are remarkably stable ; only the stereociliary tips displayed turnover and tread - milling was not observed [ 8 ] . Several proteins have been described at different locations in stereocilia , and are suggested to play important roles in formation , maintenance and function of this highly organized organelle . For example , Myosin 3 , Espin , Myosin 15a and Whirlin localize toward the tips of stereocilia where they might be involved in stereociliary elongation or actin turnover [ 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ] . Twinfilin 2 , on the other hand , is only present at the tips of middle and short rows of stereocilia ; Twinfilin 2 is able to suppress the elongation of stereociliary actin filaments and was put forward as potential elongation regulator during postnatal hair bundle maturation [ 14 , 15 ] . Taperin , a protein with partial homology to the actin - caping protein phostensin , localizes at the PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56516 taper region of stereocilia , and was suggested to modulate actin dynamics through direct or indirect interaction with pointed ends of actin filaments [ 16 , 17 ] . The cuticular plate consists of a network of actin filaments , and its development and maintenance are less understood . Because F - actin dynamics in stereocilia and cuticular plate appear to be highly controlled , we hypothesized that additional actin regulators might play roles in these unique organelles . We focused on FCH ( FER - CIP4 homology ) domain and double SH3 domains containing proteins 1 and 2 ( FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 ) , which are mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Nervous Wreck ( Nwk ) [ 18 ] . FCHSD1 , FCHSD2 and Nwk belong to the F - BAR ( FCH and Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs ) protein family . BAR / F - BAR proteins are a class of cytosolic proteins that have the ability to bind plasma membranes and thereby to couple other proteins such as actin cytoskeleton with plasma membranes [ 19 , 20 ] . They all have a BAR or F - BAR domain at the amino - terminus and other domains such as SH3 , RhoGAP , or PH domains near the carboxyl - terminus , which may mediate the interaction with actin regulatory proteins . Functionally , BAR / F - BAR proteins have been shown to interact with plasma membranes and are involved in F - actin modulation , which implicates them in many funda - mental biological processes , such as endocytosis , exocytosis , cytoskeletal reorganization , and cell migration [ 21 ] . Nwk , the ortholog of FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 , was first identified in Drosophila where mutations of nwk gene cause excessive growth of neuromuscular junctions ( NMJ ) , resulting in seizure - like spasms and paralysis [ 22 ] . Nwk modulates F - actin dynamics or endocy - tosis via binding to F - actin regulatory proteins Wsp , Dynamin , Dap160 , and Snx16 [ 23 , 24 , 25 ] . At present the function of FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 is largely unknown , except that FCHSD2 , which was named Carom when first identified , was shown to bind scaffolding proteins MAGI - 1 and CASK and associate with cytoskeleton [ 26 ] . In this study , we demonstrate that FCHSD1 localizes to the cuticular plate , whereas FCHSD2 mainly localizes along the stereocilia . Similar to their fly ortholog , both proteins regulate F - actin assembly . FCHSD2 binds WASP and N - WASP , and stimulates WASP - Arp2 / 3 - mediated F - actin polymerization in vi - tro . FCHSD1 doesn’t bind WASP or N - WASP , and has no effect on WASP - Arp2 / 3 - mediated F - actin polymerization by itself . Instead , it interacts with Sorting Nexin 9 ( SNX9 ) , a well characterized BAR protein involved in actin cytoskeleton regula - tion [ 27 ] , and enhances SNX9’s WASP - Arp2 / 3 - dependent F - actin polymerization activity . Interestingly , in hair cells , SNX9 is present in the cuticular plate , where it colocalizes with FCHSD1 . Our findings suggest that FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 are F - actin regulatory proteins expressed in stereocilia and cuticular plate of sensory hair cells and may be involved in development and / or maintenance of the F - actin cytoskeleton of these organelles .

The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on agarose gel . Western Blot and Co - Immunoprecipitation Tissues of postnatal day 5 mouse ( C57BL / 6 ) were dissected and homogenized in ice - cold lysis buffer consisting of 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris at pH 7 . 5 , 1 % ( vol / vol ) Triton X - 100 , 1 mM PMSF , and 1 X protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma - Aldrich , Saint Louis , MO ) .

Whole - Mount Immunostaining All steps were performed at room temperature unless otherwise indicated . Samples of organ of Corti from Balb / c or C57BL / 6 mice were dissected and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde , then permeabilized and blocked with PBT1 buffer ( 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 % BSA , 5 % heat - inactivated goat serum in PBS , pH 7 . 3 ) for 30 minutes . Samples were incubated overnight at 4 u C with 10 m g / ml anti - FCHSD1 or anti - FCHSD2 antibody ( or 3 m g / ml anti - SNX9 antibody ) diluted in PBT1 , then washed twice with PBT1 for 10 minutes and twice with PBT2 ( 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 1 % BSA in PBS ) for 5 minutes , and incubated with 7 . 5 m g / ml FITC ( or Cy5 ) - FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 Regulate Actin Assembly PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56516 conjugated secondary antibody ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc . , West Grove , PA ) in PBT2 for 1 hour , followed by washing with PBT2 twice for 10 minutes and PBS once for 10 minutes . Samples were incubated with 4 m g / ml TRITC - conjugated phalloidin in PBS for 30 minutes followed by three 10 - minutes washes with PBS , then mounted in Cytomation Fluorescent Mounting Medium ( Dako , Carpinteria , CA ) and imaged with a confocal microscope ( LSM Pascal , Zeiss , Germany ) . Yeast Two - Hybrid Screen The screen was performed as described previously [ 28 ] . Chicken FCHSD1 cDNA was amplified from chicken basilar papilla cDNA and cloned into vector pBD - GAL4 Cam ( Strata - gene ) to express the bait protein . The yeast strain AH109 ( Clontech , Mountain View , CA ) transformed with this bait plasmid was then transformed with a chicken basilar papilla cDNA library in the HybriZAP two - hybrid vector [ 29 ] . HIS3 was used as the primary reporter gene for the screen in the presence of 7 . 5 mM of 3 - amino - 1 , 2 , 4 - triazole . Totally 6 . 3 6 10 6 transformants were selectively screened and positive colonies were tested for activation of two other reporter genes ADE2 and lacZ . The pAD - GAL4 - based phagemid vectors in triple - positive yeast colonies were recovered and cDNA inserts were sequenced . Protein Purification The cDNAs encoding FCHSD1 D C ( amino acids 1 – 627 ) , FCHSD2 D C ( amino acids 1 – 631 ) , and full - length SNX9 were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX - 4T - 2 . The cDNA encoding WASP145 ( missing amino - terminal 145 amino acids ) was amplified by PCR and cloned into pET - 28a . The plasmids were then transformed into E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) strain to express fusion proteins in the presence of isopropyl - b - D - thiogalactopyr - anoside ( IPTG ) ( 1 mM , 0 . 1 mM , 0 . 05 mM , 1 mM for GST - FCHSD1 D C , GST - FCHSD2 D C , GST - SNX9 and His - WASP145 , respectively ) over night at room temperature . The fusion proteins were purified using Glutathione Sepharose 4B ( GE Healthcare ) or Ni - NTA agarose ( TransGen , Beijing , China ) according to manufacturer’s instructions and further fractionated by gel filtration chromatography ( Superdex - 200 , Pharmacia , for GST - FCHSD1 D C , GST - FCHSD2 D C and GST - SNX9 ) or an - ion - exchange ( Source - 15Q , Pharmacia , for His - WASP145 ) . Bo - vine Arp2 / 3 complex was purchased from Cytoskeleton , Inc ( Denver , CO ) . Actin was isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle as described previously [ 30 ] and G - actin was further purified using Sephacryl S - 300 chromatography at 4 u C in Buffer G ( 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mM imidazole , and 5 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) [ 31 ] . To trace the dynamics of actin polymerization , actin was labeled on Cys - 374 with pyrene iodoacetamide [ 31 ] . Actin Polymerization Assay Monomeric actin ( 3 m M , 10 % pyrene - labeled ) was incubated with different protein samples ( Arp2 / 3 protein complex , 20 nM ; His - WASP145 , 40 nM ; GST - FCHSD1 D C , 1 mM ; GST - FCHSD2 D C , 1 mM ; GST - SNX9 , 1 mM ; GST , 1 mM ) for 4 minutes at room temperature . Then 1 / 10 volume of 10 6 KMEI ( 500 mM KCl , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM EGTA , and 100 mM imidazole - HCl , pH 7 . 0 ) was added into the mixture and F - actin polymerization was monitored with a QuantaMaster Lumines - cence QM 3 PH fluorometer ( Photon Technology International , South Brunswick , NJ ) using an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and an emission wavelength of 407 nm . Results Mammalian FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 are Widely Expressed FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 share similar domain organization with their fly ortholog Nwk , containing an amino - terminal F - BAR domain and two SH3 domains near their carboxyl - termini ( Fig . 1A ) . Their F - BAR and SH3 domains are well conserved between fly and mouse , with over 40 % amino - acid identity for the F - BAR domains and over 50 % amino - acid identity for the SH3 domains . The only exception is FCHSD1’s F - BAR domain , which has only 28 % identity with Nwk’s F - BAR domain . We amplified the cDNA of mouse FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 from a cochlear cDNA library , subcloned the coding sequences into expression vectors and expressed epitope - tagged full - length proteins in cultured cells . Both epitope - tagged proteins showed an exclusive cytoplasmic localization in transfected HEK293 cells ( Data not shown ) . It has been shown that F - BAR proteins can form dimers [ 32 ] , so we performed co - immunoprecipitation ( co - IP ) experi - ments to examine whether FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 also do so . Our results show that FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 could form homo - and hetero - oligomers ( Fig . 1B and 1C ) . To examine the expression of mouse Fchsd1 and Fchsd2 mRNAs in different tissues , we performed RT - PCR experiments . Our results reveal that both genes are detected in all the organs and tissues examined . Fchsd1 appeared to be most abundantly expressed in the cortex , whereas Fchsd2 appeared generally expressed at easily detectable levels ( Fig . 2A ) . FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 Are Detectable in Stereocilia and Cuticular Plate Our RT - PCR results indicated that both Fchsd1 and Fchsd2 mRNAs are expressed in inner ear , so we then examined the expression of the two corresponding proteins in auditory sensory epithelia using whole - mount immunostaining . The specificity of antibodies was confirmed by Western blot of native mouse inner ear tissues ( Fig . 2B ) . In the organ of Corti , FCHSD1 immuno - reactivity was detected mainly in the cuticular plate ( Fig . 3A – B and Fig . S1 ) . FCHSD2 immunoreactivity was identified in the stereocilia ( Fig . 3C – E ) . In stereocilia , FCHSD2 immunoreactivity was distributed along the whole shaft in a punctuate pattern , where it was visible as two parallel rows flanking the F - actin core ( Fig . 3D and Fig . S2 ) . FCHSD2 Regulates WASP - Arp2 / 3 - mediated F - actin Polymerization The localization of FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 in the stereocilia and the cuticular plate suggest that they might interact with F - actin in these actin - rich organelles . Because Drosophila Nwk has been shown to bind Wsp and regulate F - actin assembly in vitro [ 23 ] , we hypothesized that mammalian Nwk orthologs ( FCHSD1 , FCHSD2 ) and Wsp orthologs ( WASP , N - WASP ) would also be able to interact in a similar fashion . To test this possibility , we expressed epitope - tagged FCHSD1 , FCHSD2 , WASP , and N - WASP in cultured cells , and performed co - IP experiments . Our results revealed that FCHSD2 co - immunoprecipitates with WASP and N - WASP , whereas FCHSD1 barely does so ( Fig . 4A ) . We then expressed FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 in E . coli and examined their ability to regulate F - actin polymerization in vitro . During the experiment we found that full - length FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 proteins accumulate in inclusion bodies in E . coli , which would have required refolding of the proteins for functional assays . Inclusion body formation did not happen , however , when we expressed FCHSD1 D C and FCHSD2 D C , which lack the carbox - yl - terminal 61 and 118 amino acids , respectively , but retain F - FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 Regulate Actin Assembly PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 3 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56516 BAR and both SH3 domains . A similar truncated Nwk protein has been shown to rescue the phenotype caused by nwk gene mutation in Drosophila , suggesting that the deleted part does not affect the function of Nwk [ 23 ] . For WASP , we expressed and purified the WASP145 fragment , which lacks the amino - terminal WH1 domain and retains its actin polymerization promoting activity [ 23 , 33 ] . Our results showed that FCHSD2 D C stimulated actin polymerization when WASP145 and Arp2 / 3 protein complex were present , whereas FCHSD1 D C did not promote increased actin polymerization ( Fig . 4B , compare the effect of FCHSD1 D C with that of GST ) . This result is consistent with the observation that there was no detectable interaction between FCHSD1 and WASP ( Fig . 4A ) . FCHSD1 Requires SNX9 for Activation of WASP - Arp2 / 3 - mediated F - actin Polymerization FCHSD1 does not bind WASP or N - WASP in our co - IP experiments and is unable to modulate F - actin assembly , which raised the question whether FCHSD1 can regulate F - actin assembly through other mechanisms , perhaps involving other proteins . Hence , we performed yeast two - hybrid screens of a chicken cochlear ( basilar papilla ) cDNA library to identify potential FCHSD1 - interaction partners . Consistent with the co - IP results , neither WASP nor N - WASP was identified in the screen . Instead , we noticed a resilient interaction of the bait with a cDNA library clone encoding Sorting Nexin 9 ( SNX9 ) , a ubiquitously expressed BAR protein family member with a SH3 domain and a phox homology ( PX ) domain [ 34 ] . SNX9 has been shown to associate with WASP , N - WASP , Dynamin1 , Dynamin2 , Ack , or EspF through its SH3 domain , and functionally , it has been implicated in intracellular trafficking and F - actin assembly [ 27 ] . As a confirmation assay for the yeast two - hybrid screen , we conducted co - IP experiments and found that FCHSD1 co - immunoprecipitates with SNX9 , but FCHSD2 does not ( Fig . 5A ) . We then mapped the domains responsible for the interaction between FCHSD1 and SNX9 by expressing different domains in cultured cells and repeating the co - IP experiments ( Fig . 5B ) . We found that the F - BAR domain of FCHSD1 and the SH3 domain of SNX9 are responsible for the interaction ( Fig . 5C and 5D ) . The identification of SNX9 as FCHSD1 binding partner suggests that these two proteins might be able to work together to regulate F - actin assembly . It has been shown previously that SNX9 stimulates F - actin polymerization in a WASP - Arp2 / 3 - dependent way [ 35 ] . We found that although FCHSD1 D C had no effect on F - actin polymerization by itself , it greatly enhanced SNX9’s activity ( Fig . 5E ) . In contrast , although both FCHSD2 D C and SNX9 do stimulate F - actin polymerization , there is no synergistic effect between them ( Fig . 5F ) , which is consistent with the observation that there was no detectable interaction between FCHSD2 and SNX9 ( Fig . 5A ) . SNX9 Is Detectable in the Cuticular Plate The interaction of FCHSD1 with SNX9 raised the question whether SNX9 protein can be detected in auditory hair cells . We examined the expression of SNX9 in hair cells by performing whole - mount immunostaining with an affinity - purified polyclonal antibody against SNX9 , whose specificity was confirmed by Western blot of native mouse inner ear tissues ( Fig . 2B ) . The results showed that SNX9 immunoreactivity was clearly visible in the cuticular plate , but not in the stereocilia ( Fig . 6A and 6B ) . In the cuticular plate , SNX9 and FCHSD1 immunoreactivity colocalized in the same confocal sections ( Fig . 6C and 6D ) , suggesting that SNX9 and FCHSD1 might associate with each other in the cuticular plate .

Our study revealed that FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 , despite the high homology of the two proteins , possess subtle but significant functional and expression differences . The most significant difference between FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 involves the ability of regulating F - actin polymerization . Similar to Nwk , FCHSD2 binds to WASP or N - WASP , and stimulates actin polymerization in a WASP - Arp2 / 3 - dependent way . In contrast , FCHSD1 does not bind to WASP or N - WASP , and has no effect on actin polymerization when WASP and Arp2 / 3 are present . Nevertheless , FCHSD1 promotes F - actin polymerization via binding to SNX9 . SNX9 has been shown to stimulate F - actin polymerization in a WASP - Arp2 / 3 - dependent way [ 35 ] , and FCHSD1 can bind to SNX9 and substantially enhance its activity in promoting F - actin polymerization . Another significant differ - ence lies in their expression patterns . Notwithstanding the wide expression profiles , FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 proteins show quite distinct localizations when investigated in sensory hair cells of the cochlea . FCHSD2 mainly localizes along the stereocilia , and FCHSD1 mainly localizes to the cuticular plate , where it colocalizes with SNX9 . The different localizations of FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 suggest that , although these two proteins have the ability to bind to each other , they may play distinct roles in hair cells independently of each other . The F - actin filled stereocilia play an important role in mechanoelectrical transduction and its growth , organization , and maintenance is regulated by ( F - ) actin modulating proteins [ 36 ] . FCHSD2 localizes along the stereocilia , and for each stereocilium , in longitudinal section , there are two parallel rows of FCHSD2 immunoreactivity flanking the F - actin core , suggesting that the stereociliary actin core is surrounded by FCHSD2 . FCHSD2 has been shown to bind MAGI - 1 and CASK [ 26 ] , both of which are scaffolding proteins and localize in the stereocilia [ 28 , 37 ] . The immunostaining pattern of FCHSD2 , however , is different from that of MAGI - 1 or CASK , suggesting that these proteins may act independently in stereocilia . FCHSD2 could stimulate WASP - Arp2 / 3 - mediated F - actin polymerization in vitro , but given the fact that stereocilia are composed of long , unbranched F - actin , and that Arp2 / 3 mainly mediate branched F - actin polymerization [ 38 , 39 ] , it seems unlikely that FCHSD2 plays a role in regulating actin polymerization in stereocilia . F - BAR proteins have been Figure 2 . Expression analysis of mouse Fchsd1 and Fchsd2 in different tissues .

The localization of FCHSD2 suggests that it may play a similar role in stereocilia , providing a linker between the F - actin core and the plasma membrane . Besides stereocilia , the cuticular plate is another actin - rich structure in hair cells . As a dense filamentous actin network , the cuticular plate occupies the apical cell cytoplasm of hair cells and serves as an anchor for stereocilia [ 2 , 3 ] . Different from stereocilia , the cuticular plate is mainly composed of highly branched actin filaments . Several proteins have been shown to localize in the cuticular plate , including alpha - actinin , spectrin , fimbrin , proto - cadherin 15 , myosin 6 , and myosin 7a [ 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 ] . Mutations in protocadherin 15 , myosin 6 , or myosin 7a genes can cause disorganization of cuticular plate or result in stereocila fusion [ 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 ] . But the mechanism about how the development and maintenance of this actin - rich organelle is regulated remains to be elucidated . Here we show that FCHSD1 mainly localizes to the cuticular plate in hair cells . More interestingly , the FCHSD1 - binding protein SNX9 , although ubiquitously expressed in almost all the tissues examined [ 34 ] , is only detected in the cuticular plate within hair cells . The localization of these two proteins in this actin - rich organelle , combined with the fact that they stimulate F - actin polymerization in vitro , suggest that FCHSD1 and SNX9 might work together and regulate actin polymerization in the cuticular plate . To our knowledge , this is the first report of actin - regulatory proteins expressed in the cuticular plate . At present , the expression of Arp2 / 3 , WASP , or N - WASP in hair cells is not known . The knowledge of expression patterns of these proteins in hair cells , especially in cuticular plate , will help us to learn more about how FCHSD1 and SNX9 regulate actin assembly in this actin - rich organelle . In summary , we report here that FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 are two actin - regulatory proteins that localize in cochlear hair cell stereocilia and cuticular plate . Their different localizations suggest that these two proteins could play distinctive roles , such as maintaining the stability and integrity , or regulating F - actin dynamics , of these actin - rich organelles . Our data show that FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 accelerate F - actin polymerization in direct cooperation with WASP - Arp2 / 3 or indirectly , via SNX9 . Although not detectable in stereocilia , SNX9 was detected in the cuticular plate , where it colocalizes with FCHSD1 . The localiza - tion of FCHSD1 and SNX9 in cuticular plate and their ability to regulate F - actin polymerization could be an indication for a functional role in maintaining the stability and / or regulating the F - actin turnover in the cuticular plate . Further investigations need to be done to fully understand how these proteins are involved in maintaining and / or regulating actin filaments in hair cell Figure 3 .
