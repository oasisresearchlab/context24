Interestingly , endophilin , an SH3 domain protein data establish a role for auxilin in endocytosis at the formation of constricted coated pits . We propose that proposed to be a dynamin effector ( Schmidt et al . , 1999 ) , was not bound to the column ( Figure 1D - VII ) .

( B ) GST or GST - GTPase was incubated initially with rat brain cytosol ( RBC ) in the presence of 0 . 5 mM GDP ( lane 2 ) , GTP (cid:1) S ( lane 3 ) , or no nucleotide ( lane 1 ) .

In this assay , auxilin 405 - 910 , but not interaction leads to potent stimulation of dynamin’s GTPase activity ( “assembled rate” ) ( Tuma , 1994 ; War - Hsc70 , almostcompletely inhibitedGAP - mediatedstim - ulation ( Figure 3A ) . Potent inhibition of dynamin’s nock et al . , 1996 ) . We therefore tested whether Hsc70 and auxilin could influence the GTPase activity of dy - GTPase activity was also achieved with full - length auxi - lin ( data not shown ) . In addition , auxilin could also inhibit namin and found that they did not stimulate dynamin’s basal GTPase rate ( data not shown ) . We next asked the stimulated GTPase activity of the ubiquitously ex - pressed dynamin - 2 isoform ( data not shown ) . Auxilin’s whether auxilin or Hsc70 affected the GTPase rate of assembled dynamin . To this end , auxilin or Hsc70 was inhibition of dynamin exhibited highly cooperative be - havior ( Figure 3B ) .

In a similar manner , the addition of auxilin 405 - 910 significantly inhibited dynamin self - assembly , whereas GST had no effect . Together , these results identify auxilin as a novel dynamin : GTP binding protein that interacts with dynamin’s GAP do - main and possibly its GTP - bound GTPase domain . These interactions appear to induce the same allosteric conformational changes within dynamin tetramers that occur during dynamin self - assembly . Auxilin Contains Two Dynamin Binding Domains To localize dynamin’s binding domain within auxilin , we purified different segments of auxilin from bacteria ( Fig - ures 4A and 4B ) , and their inhibitory activity was exam - ined in the GAP / dynamin GTPase assay . Two nonover - lapping domains , aux 405 - 591 and aux 591 - 814 , inhibited the assembled GTPase rate of dynamin ( Figures 4A and 4C ) . Aux 405 - 591 bound slightly better than aux 405 - 910 but did not completely abolishthe stimulated rate ofGTP hydrolysis ( compare black circles in Figure 3B and Figure 4C ) , whereas aux 591 - 814 bound 4 - fold less avidly than aux 405 - 910 yet inhibited the stimulated rate completely . Amino acids within aux 405 - 591 have not been implicated in any specific function , whereas amino acids within aux 591 - 814 interact with clathrin and AP - 2 ( Holstein et al . , 1996 ; Scheele et al . , 2001 ) . These results suggest that there Figure 2 .

Thus , we examined whether auxilin fragments auxilin ( B ) , recombinantauxilin 405 - 910 ( C ) , and GAP ( D ) . All incubations harboring a dynamin binding site could interfere with were performed in buffer HCB100 with the indicated nucleotide for auxilin’s known role in uncoating CCVs . To this end , 60 min at 4 (cid:5) C . 25 % of the incubation mixture was loaded as a total auxilin fragments were titrated into an assay in which protein standard ( lanes 1 – 4 ) , and remaining beads were extensively washed and bound protein eluted with boiling ( lanes 5 – 8 ) . 0 . 5 mM CCV uncoating is mediated by auxilin already present on guanine nucleotides , as indicated in the figure , were present at all coated vesicles isolated from bovine brain , and added times . The samples were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immu - native Hsc70 . As expected given previous results ( Hol - noblotting . steinetal . , 1996 ) , aux 405 - 910 , whichcontainsboththeDnaJ and clathrin binding domains , did not inhibit uncoating , whereas aux 405 - 814 and aux 591 - 814 , which both lack the J interactions ( Sever et al . , 1999 ) exhibit the same high domain , did ( Figure 4D ) . Importantly , aux 405 - 591 , which degree of cooperativity . These data suggest that auxilin contains dynamin but not clathrin binding domains , did may induce the same allosteric conformational changes not inhibit CCV uncoating . Together , these results show within dynamin as the interactions taking place during that auxilin contains at least two dynamin binding sites : dynamin assembly . Importantly , an increased concen - one exclusive for dynamin and one involved in multiple tration of added GAP could overcome inhibition by auxi - protein interactions . Interestingly , auxilin also contains lin ( Figure 3C ) , demonstrating that GAP competes for more than one binding site for clathrin , and these sites auxilin binding to dynamin . We previously showed that are also tandemly arranged ( Scheele et al . , 2001 ) . There - the GAP domain , on its own , stimulates GTP hydrolysis fore , it seems that auxilin is capable of engaging in by interacting with the GAP domain within unassembled numerous interactions with proteins involved in endocy - dynamin ( Sever et al . , 1999 ) . Indeed , we could not detect tosis . binding between auxilin and theisolated GAP or GTPase domains ( data not shown ) . Therefore , auxilin’s ability to abrogate GAP stimulation suggests that auxilin is likely Auxilin - Dynamin Interactions Are Essential for CCV Formation binding both the GAP and the GTPase domains within dynamin . We next examined whether interactions between dy - namin and auxilin are required for endocytosis . HeLa To demonstrate directly that auxilin interacts with the GAP domain within full - length dynamin , we performed cells stably expressing a chimeric tetracycline - regulat - able transcription activator ( tTA - HeLa ) were infected sedimentation assays that monitor dynamin assembly , previously shown to be mediated by GAP - GAP interac - with adenoviruses recombined with different auxilin cDNA fragments .

The error bars reflect the (cid:6) SD from five inde - pendent experiments . aux WT virus were also grown in the presence of tetracy - in this case has been explained as an indirect conse - quence of auxilin’s ability to sequester clathrin into non - cline , which inhibits protein expression , as a control for viral infection ( Figure 5 , open square ) .

Since auxilin contains a putative lipid binding BXX - Tfn uptake and recycling in uninfected cells were indistinguishablefrom thosemeasuredin virallyinfected domain ( Figure 4A , amino acids 1 – 356 ) , which may play a role in auxilin recruitment to the plasma membrane , cells grown in the presence of tetracycline , demonstra - ting that the infection did not affect Tfn trafficking ( data we asked whether overexpression of this domain could inhibit endocytosis . As shown in Figure 5 ( gray squares ) , not shown ) . If interactions between auxilin and dynamin are important for CCV formation , then aux 405 - 591 and overexpression of aux 1 - 405 had no effect on endocytosis , suggesting that this domain likely plays a postbudding aux 591 - 814 are expected to act as dominant - negatives for endocytosis by competing with the endogenous role . Importantly , none of the fragments affected recycling auxilin - 2 for dynamin . Inagreement with this hypothesis , overexpression of aux 405 - 591 decreased the rate and ex - of Tfn to the cell surface , as seen by the fact that after the initial uptake at 5 min , the internalized BXX - Tfn was tent of receptor - mediated endocytosis approximately 2 - fold when compared to uninduced cells ( Figure 5 , efficiently recycled ( t 1 / 2 (cid:1) 15 min ) out to the cell surface ( Figure 5 , later time points ) .

More potent inhibition of endocytosis , approximately 4 - fold , was ob - assembly would limit the cellular sorting of Tfn and pre - vent recycling , our results suggest that the observed served in cells overexpressing aux 591 - 814 ( Figure 5 , open circles ) . Given that both adenoviruses gave a similar inhibition of Tfn internalization by the auxilin fragments is not principally due to impaired CCV uncoating . Lack level of infection efficiency ( (cid:7) 90 % ) , with similar levels of protein expression ( Figure 5 , inset ) , aux 591 - 814 acts as of a CCV uncoating defect in vivo by aux 591 - 814 is most likely due to the relatively low levels of protein expres - the more potent inhibitor . This difference might be due to the clathrin binding domain within aux 591 - 814 either hav - sion that occur with adenoviral expression compared to in vitro inhibitory concentrations ( Figure 4D ) . The ab - ing an additional inhibitory effect on uncoating CCVs ( but see below ) or better targeting of this fragment to sence of an uncoating defect suggests that the potent inhibition of endocytosis by aux 591 - 814 occurred prior to the active site at the plasma membrane where it can encounter dynamin . or included CCV formation .

The effective concentration and the extent of inhibition were similar that did not inhibit endocytosis ( Figure 5 ) , as well as in uninfected cells ( Figures 6A – 6D , see arrows ) . Together , to previously reported effects of different SH3 - domains in this assay ( Hill et al . , 2001 ; Simpson et al . , 1999 ) . our data strongly argue that there are two different mechanisms by which auxilin can inhibit endocytosis : Addition of aux 405 - 910 also inhibited endocytosis , in agree - ment with its ability to sequester cytosolic clathrin into indirectly , by aberrant polymerization of cytosolic clathrin ( as in the case of aux WT and aux 405 - 910 ) , and di - nonfunctional aggregates .

Interactions between Dynamin and Auxilin Are Important for Endocytosis ( A ) Endocytosis of biotinylated transferrin ( BXX - Tfn ) in perforatedA431cells isinhibited by addition of auxilin fragments . Membranes were incubated with increasing concentra - tions of GST ( gray squares ) , aux 405 - 487 ( open squares ) , aux 405 - 910 ( black squares ) , aux 405 - 591 ( black circles ) , or aux 591 - 814 ( open circles ) for 20 min on ice before addition of cytosol . The amount of internalized BXX - Tfn after 10 min at 37 (cid:5) C was determined by avidin inaccessi - bility , as previously described ( Smythe et al . , 1992 ) , and plotted as % of uptake in the ab - sence of auxilin fragments . Results are the average of three independent experiments (cid:6) SD . ( B ) Inhibition of endocytosis by auxilin frag - ments can be overcome by addition of dy - namin . The experiments were performed es - sentially as under ( A ) , using 6 (cid:4) M of different auxilin fragments , with the exception that 1 . 25 (cid:4) M of purified dynamin ( dyn ) was added as indicated .

( C ) New model for the role of dynamin in for - mation of CCVs . Coat assembly starts with recruitment of adaptors ( AP2 ) followed by re - cruitment of clathrin . Oligomerized clathrin recruits auxilin , which in turn recruits Hsc70 . Exchange of cytosolic clathrin with assembled clathrin due to activity of Hsc70 / auxilin is believed to drive invagination of coated pits . Dynamin : GTP is recruited through an as yet unknown mechanism to the neck of the invaginating pit , and it redistributes Hsc70 / auxilin to this location . Hsc70 / auxilinchaperoneactivityinturninducesconformationalchangeswithintheclathrincoatthatdriveformationoftheconstricted coated pit . GTP hydrolysis returns dynamin to the cytosol , disengages its interactions with Hsc70 / auxilin , and allows unhindered coat rearrangement that executes the budding of free CCVs . Thus , dynamin GTP hydrolysis may temporally couple collared neck disassembly with localized clathrinuncoating toyield fissionof thecoated pit . In summary , we proposethat themajor endocyticrole ofdynamin isto concentrate the uncoating chaperone machinery at the neck of the coated pit to mediate constriction and fission of the emerging coated vesicle . anotherregionofdynamin . Auxilincontainstwodynamin and the fragment had no effect on vesicle uncoating or recycling ( Figures 4D and 6 ) . We showed that aux 405 - 910 bindingssites , andtheiroverexpressioninhibitsendocy - tosis . We propose that dynamin - auxilin interactions are inhibited dynamin assembly ( Figure 3D ) , and it is ex - pected that the minimal dynamin binding fragment , essential for CCV formation at the plasma membrane . aux 405 - 591 , would have the same effect given its ability to impair assembly - stimulated GTP hydrolysis by dynamin A Role for Hsc70 / Auxilin in the Early ( Figure 4C ) . Therefore , there is a formal possibility that Stages of Endocytosis aux 405 - 591 inhibits early steps of endocytosis by inhibiting Mounting evidence directly indicates that Hsc70 is re - dynamin self - assembly . This interpretation assumes quired for the early stages of endocytosis that also re - that dynamin self - assembly is essential for fission of quire dynamin , and various lines of circumstantial evi - CCVs , an assumption most strongly supported by the dence have also implicated auxilin ( Chang et al . , 2002 ; observation that GTP hydrolysis of assembled dynamin Ho¨ning et al . , 1994 ; Morgan et al . , 2001 ; Newmyer and can lead to fragmentation of synthetic lipid tubes in vitro Schmid , 2001 ) .

However , thesignificance was suggested by its interactions with the appendage of this assay for vesicle budding in vivo has not been domain of AP - 2 ( Owen et al . , 1999 ) and by studies show - documented .

Here , we show that cellular expres - sion of aux 405 - 591 , which binds to dynamin , inhibits en - Is Dynamin a Classical Regulatory GTPase ? Dynamin has been viewed as a pinchase that executes docytosis without leading to sequestration of clathrin ( Figure 6 ) . The inhibition occurred in single - round endo - thefissionreaction ( DaninoandHinshaw , 2001 ; Hinshaw and Schmid , 1995 ; Marks et al . , 2001 ; McNiven , 1998 ; cytosis assays in vivo and in vitro ( Figures 5 and 7A ) , Dynamin and Chaperones 937 Warnock and Schmid , 1996 ) and a classical regulatory In this view , the role of dynamin is to provide spatial GTPasethatrecruitseffectorsoffission ( Fishetal . , 2000 ; and temporal regulation of sequential reactions required Severetal . , 1999 , 2000 ) .

Recently , the regulatory model binding to dynamin’s GAP and thus inhibits assembly - gained further support from the crystal structure of the stimulated GTP hydrolysis , it effectively prolongs dy - GTPase domain of Dictyostelium discoideum dynamin , namin in the GTP - bound state .
