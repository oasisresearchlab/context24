This study investigates how conspir - acy mentality may affect compliance with preventive health measures necessary to fight the COVID - 19 pandemic , and the underlying emotional and cognitive mediators . Data was col - lected through a survey among 1878 Chinese respondents at the conclusion of the pan - demic . The results indicate that individuals with higher levels of conspiracy mentality are significantly less engaged in preventive behaviors . Furthermore , this correlation is mediated by a sequence of mediating factors , starting from anger leading to institutional distrust and fear leading to perceived risk . Conspiracists’ response mode can be described as a state of " attentive immobility , " in which the impact of heightened institutional distrust outweighs their perceptions of risk , ultimately reducing engagement in preventive behaviors during crises . These findings underscore the importance of debunking initiatives that aim to address and mitigate the negative consequences of conspiracy mentality by targeting the mediating psy - chological processes during future pandemic threats . Introduction On May 5 , 2023 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) declared the end of the COVID - 19 " public health emergency of international concern " [ 1 ] . First sounded on January 30 , 2020 , this alert persisted for over three years , during which the world witnessed more than 770 million confirmed cases of the virus [ 2 ] . As the disease spreads rapidly worldwide , a plethora of viral misinformation , especially conspiracy theories , has emerged and gained significant traction on social media platforms [ 3 – 9 ] . These propagated conspiracy theories have been recognized as potential impediments to government efforts aimed at implementing preventive health mea - sures to curb the virus’s spread , thereby exacerbating public health crises [ 10 – 12 ] .

Competinginterests : The authorshave declared that no competinginterestsexist . current research , we explore how conspiracy theories influence individual preventive behav - iors during the Covid - 19 pandemic . We further analyze the mediating roles of emotions , spe - cifically anger and fear , along with cognitive factors like institutional distrust and perceived risk . These insights are instrumental for strategizing against the dissemination of conspiracy theories in future public crises . Psychology of conspiracy mentality Conspiracy theories offer alternative explanations for significant events , suggesting the pres - ence of covert schemes orchestrated by influential and malevolent factions [ 13 ] . These theories frequently challenge conventional narratives , positing that official accounts of events are mis - leading , concealing hidden truths [ 14 ] . COVID - 19 fosters the creation of conspiracy theories , as such theories tend to emerge during threatening moments of crisis that breed uncertainty [ 15 ] . Some of the most prevalent theories include that 5G technology is responsible for the transmission of the virus , that the virus is a deliberate creation as a biological weapon originat - ing from China , and that Bill Gates is exploiting the pandemic to establish global control through mandatory vaccination and surveillance initiatives . Although various conspiracy theo - ries might seem to be irrelevant in their content , they are rooted in varying degrees of mistrust or antipathy against higher - status groups , officials , or established mainstream accounts . Belief in conspiracy theories is prevalent among the general public , particularly during soci - etal crisis situations such as a pandemic [ 10 , 16 ] . A social media analysis of COVID - 19 - related infodemic around the globe revealed that 7 . 8 % of the 2 , 311 reports in 25 languages from 87 countries were identified as conspiracy theories [ 17 ] . In a recent survey regarding COVID - 19 conspiracy beliefs , 35 % of the Turkish population strongly agreed that COVID - 19 was created in a laboratory as a biological weapon , while 28 % strongly agreed that events like COVID - 19 were caused by a small group with secret goals and 26 % strongly agreed that scientists inten - tionally deceived the public regarding the virus [ 18 ] . Moreover , researchers consistently find that endorsing one particular conspiracy statement increases the likelihood of believing seemly unrelated and even mutually incompatible ones [ 19 – 22 ] . These findings have led scholars to argue that a broader worldview , often referred to as a “conspiracy mentality” , may underpin conspiracy beliefs , and this mentality tends to remain stable over time [ 8 , 23 – 26 ] . This general worldview , marked by a perception of the world as rife with conspiracies , can contribute to the acceptance of conspiracy theories pertaining to specific events , such as those related to COVID - 19 . Conspiracy mentality has important social and health - related consequences [ 27 ] including reduced engagement with mainstream politics , climate change initiatives , vaccination pro - grams , and conventional medical treatments [ 5 ] . Furthermore , it has been recognized as a potential hindrance to constructive public responses during the pandemic [ 10 ] . Drawing this research together , we hypothesize that conspiracy mentality might negatively impact adher - ence to COVID - 19 mitigation measures , and we focus on the emotional and cognitive mecha - nisms involved . Affective intelligence theory Considering the world has been repeatedly hit by pandemics such as Spanish flu , SARS , and swine flu , it is evident that negative emotions play a crucial role in shaping individuals’ responses to crises [ 28 ] . Affective intelligence theory ( AIT ) posits that emotions serve as an adaptive system that significantly influences our cognition and subsequent behaviors [ 29 ] . Emotions are not merely by - products of cognition but play a pivotal role in shaping it . They PLOS ONE Emotional - cognitive mechanismunderlying conspiracymentality and Covid - 19preventive behaviors PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0294681 November16 , 2023 2 / 18 guide individuals in decision - making processes by signaling when to rely on established habits or when to seek new information [ 29 – 33 ] . Anger and fear , two crucial negative emotions , are often jointly triggered by different types of social threats , and in turn influence individuals’ preferences and behaviors to cope with these threats [ 30 , 34 – 36 ] . For instance , data collected from over 12 , 000 respondents across six European countries demonstrated that exposure to the threat of the COVID - 19 pandemic can evoke both anger and fear [ 28 ] . Another survey conducted by Erhardt et al . [ 34 ] revealed that fear and anger exert contrasting impacts on trust in the government during COVID - 19 crises : fear enhances trust in the government , while anger assigns blame for adverse circumstances to the government . Building on AIT , these two specific emotional appraisals of a threat are neural correlates to different regions of the brain and leads to very different downstream behavioral consequences [ 37 , 38 ] . Anger regulates behavior aimed at securing familiar goals by relying on preexisting convictions . However , encourages individuals to identify novelty and new infor - mation , fostering a learning process regarding the threat that could facilitate innovative behav - ioral responses [ 34 ] . Negative emotions during the COVID - 19 pandemic in China Negative emotions were widespread in times of Covid - 19 [ 39 ] , especially in China , where the strict " zero - COVID " prevention policy enforced for three - years . China was among the first countries to declare COVID - 19 a major public health emergency in early 2020 . In response , Chinese authorities swiftly implemented rigorous measures , including strict lockdowns , mass testing , extensive contact tracing , enforced quarantine for confirmed and suspected cases , and travel restrictions . These " zero - COVID " measures were maintained for three years , establish - ing China as a nation with one of the most enduring COVID - 19 prevention strategies . However , in December 2022 , with the emergence of new variants and increased global travel , the Chinese government recognized the need for a more comprehensive approach . Sub - sequently , China transitioned its prevention policy from strict to lenient quickly , adapting to the changing situation [ 40 , 41 ] . These policy shifts generated mixed feelings among the general population [ 42 ] . With the long - lasting restrictions , many people experienced anger and dis - trust in the government . They longed for a return to a more normal way of life and the resumption of previously halted activities . On the other hand , fear lingered within the public , as the liberalization of measures raised concerns about the potential for increased infections and health risks . Moreover , conspiracy mentality is inclined to exacerbate emotional issues , particularly in the context of the COVID - 19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns . The perception of vulner - ability and attack associated with conspiracy theories is linked to negative psychological states , including low self - esteem , diminished mental health , feelings of powerlessness , fear , and anger [ 43 ] . Studies also demonstrate that conspiracy mentality is a risk factor for an increased likeli - hood of experiencing anxiety , depressive feelings , and distress during COVID - 19 lockdowns , regardless of the region [ 44 – 46 ] . It is evident that conspiracy beliefs not only fail to provide any beneficial consequences but also contribute to the reinforcement of negative experiences , such as anxiety , aversion to uncertainty , and existential threats [ 9 ] . Cognitive characteristics and behavioral consequences of conspiracy mentality Previous research has identified significant associations between conspiracy mentality and var - ious cognitive consequences , a primary one of which is distrust in institutions . Scholars have characterized conspiracy mentality as mistrust , paranoia , and defiance towards powerful PLOS ONE Emotional - cognitive mechanismunderlying conspiracymentality and Covid - 19preventive behaviors PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0294681 November16 , 2023 3 / 18 groups , authority figures , and established narratives [ 24 , 26 , 47 ] . This distrust is reported to be linked with distrust in science in general , or susceptibility to deceptive pseudoscience [ 8 , 48 ] , and a reduced likelihood of adhering to government guidelines [ 43 ] . A study conducted by Chadwick et al . [ 49 ] explored the relationship between conspiracy mentality , social media use , online social endorsement , and their implication for vaccine hesitancy . The findings indicated that people scoring higher in conspiracy mentality show significantly greater intention to use social media to discourage vaccination rather than to encourage it . Nevertheless , the precise relationship among conspiracy mentality , distrust , and preventive health behaviors remains unclear , necessitating further investigation . Conspiracy mentality is also closely associated with higher perceptions of risk or threats , as individuals often embrace conspiracy theories as a response to stress - provoking events . This inclination is driven by various social psychological motives , including the quest for subjective certainty , control , security , and the preservation of a positive self - image or group identity [ 13 , 15 ] . Additionally , individuals with an underlying conspiratorial reasoning style tend to be more susceptible to strengthening their belief in conspiracy theories when confronted with external stressors [ 50 ] . Empirical evidence consistently supports the association between con - spiracy beliefs and feelings of uncertainty [ 51 ] , a perception of diminished socio - political con - trol [ 24 ] , heightened perceptions of risk , a sense of being under attack [ 5 , 43 , 52 ] , and feelings of threat stemming from societal changes [ 53 ] . Aside from cognitive characteristics , conspiracy mentality might further influence individ - uals’ behaviors , particularly concerning preventive health behaviors . Previous research about HIV , vaccines , and other public health topics has shown that belief in conspiracy theories increases people’s resistance against important public health interventions [ 3 , 8 , 54 ] . Examples include resistance to get vaccinations , rejection of conventional medical treatments , and pro - pensity for unsupported or potentially dangerous treatments based on non - mainstream belief systems [ 3 , 6 , 13 , 54 – 56 ] . The influence of conspiracy mentality on medical behaviors also extends to the context of Covid - 19 [ 57 ] . Studies focusing on Covid - 19 related conspiracy theo - ries have found that higher levels of coronavirus conspiracy thinking are associated with lower observance to official guidelines , reduced willingness to undergo diagnostic or antibody tests , hesitancy towards vaccination , and in some cases , intentional engagement in risky behavior [ 18 , 43 , 58 ] . Although multiple studies indicate that conspiracy mentality leads to fewer protective behaviors faced with diseases , its influence can vary depending on individuals’ specific beliefs . For instance , scholars have differentiated between various conspiracy claims and found that they might lead to different levels of containment behavior during a public health crisis . Individuals who perceive COVID - 19 as deliberately created and distributed tend to have a more threatening perception of the pandemic and exhibit more containment behavior . On the other hand , those who consider COVID - 19 a hoax perceive the pandemic as less threatening and exhibit less adherence to containment measures [ 59 ] . These findings imply that the impact of conspiracy mentality on individuals’ adoption of protective behav - iors may be mediated by emotions and cognitive factors , but the underlying mechanisms need to be further explored . Overview of the current research While numerous studies have explored the association between conspiracy mentality and pre - ventive health behaviors during pandemic crisis , limited research has delved into the mediat - ing processes that explain these relationships . To date only a small handful of studies have partly investigated the mediating effects of anger , fear , institutional distrust , and perceived risk PLOS ONE Emotional - cognitive mechanismunderlying conspiracymentality and Covid - 19preventive behaviors PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0294681 November16 , 2023 4 / 18 [ 5 , 7 , 10 , 36 ] . An enlightening study by Kari ć and Me đ edovi ć [ 7 ] examined the relationships between conspiracy beliefs , political trust and behavioral adherence . They found that reduced political trust acts as the mediating factor between conspiracy beliefs and reduced adherence to containment behaviors . Additionally , researchers have observed that distrust in authorities , feelings of powerlessness , disillusionment and perceived dangers of vaccines mediate the nega - tive relationship between anti - vaccine conspiracy beliefs and vaccination intentions [ 5 ] . How - ever , these studies are primarily exploratory and have not thoroughly examined the potential mediating effects of emotional and cognitive factors . In sum , previous research indicates that conspiracy mentality affects preventive health behaviors through a complex interplay of emotional and cognitive mediating mechanisms . However , this process still requires further investigation and clarification . In the current study , we proposed an integrated emotional – cognitive mechanism to illustrate the impact of conspir - acy mentality on preventive behaviors . Data was collected from Chinese citizens through an online retrospective survey during China’s " zero - COVID " policy relaxation ( March 30—April 18 , 2023 ) . We therefore developed the following hypotheses in our model : Hypothesis 1 ( H1 ) : Individuals scoring higher in conspiracy mentality are expected to demon - strate reduced engagement in preventive behavior during the pandemic . Hypothesis 2 ( H2 ) : The impact of conspiracy mentality on individuals’ adoption of preventive behavior is proposed to be mediated by emotions , specifically anger and fear . These emo - tions , triggered by external threats and crises , are expected to exert their influence through cognitive factors , including perceived risk and institutional distrust , ultimately affecting individuals’ engagement in preventive behavior . Hypothesis 3 ( H3 ) : The exertion process of anger differs from that of fear . Conspiracy mental - ity is expected to be a positive predictor of both anger and fear . Anger is anticipated to pri - marily lead to increased institutional distrust , and reduced protective health behavior . In contrast , fear is expected to heighten perceived risk , leading to greater adherence to preven - tive behavior . The structure of the whole model is presented below ( Fig 1 ) . Fig 1 .

The survey was conducted between March 30 , 2023 , and April 18 , 2023 , using a Chinese business survey platform ( https : / / survey . work / survey / ) . Participants were recruited through conve - nience sampling , and the population consisted of Chinese citizens who were over 18 years old and had internet access . Informed consent was retrieved from participants before they com - pleted the questionnaire . A total of 2 , 000 questionnaires were retrieved , and after excluding invalid cases such as incomplete or low - quality replies , or replies completed in unreasonable short time , data of 1878 participants were used for further data analysis . Among the participants , 53 . 35 % were male and 46 . 65 % were female , which is comparable to the gender distribution in the popula - tion ( 51 . 2 % vs . 48 . 8 % ) . The age distribution of the participants was as follows : 43 . 13 % were between the ages of 18 and 30 , 50 . 47 % were between the ages of 30 and 40 , 5 . 32 % were between the ages of 40 and 50 , and 1 . 07 % were above 50 . In terms of education , 66 . 14 % of the partici - pants had a bachelor’s degree or higher , compared to 15 . 5 % in the general population . Regard - ing residency , 54 . 74 % of the participants lived in big cities , while 45 . 26 % lived in villages or small cities , compared to 27 . 6 % and 72 . 4 % in the population , respectively . The more detailed socio - demographic breakdown of the sample is presented below in Table 1 . Measures Conspiracy mentality . We adopted items from three established scales measuring con - spiracy mentality and selected the statements assessing an individual’s attitude towards generic statements on conspiracy beliefs instead of items mentioning specific historical events or groups . Three scales are adopted and modified as follows . The Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale ( GCBS ) [ 23 ] includes 15 items measuring 5 conspiracist facets , which Brotherton et al . identified as government malfeasance , extra - terrestrial cover - up , malevolent global conspira - cies , personal well - being and control of information . Each factor was represented by three items . The conspiracy mentality scale [ 26 ] contains 12 items tapping into a general propensity to believe in conspiracies . The conspiracy theory ideation scale [ 60 ] measures general tendency to believe in any conspiracy with 7 items . After selection , 18 items were included in the ques - tionnaire . Participants were asked to indicate their attitudes towards the statements using a seven - point Likert scale , where 1 represented “strongly disagree” and 7 represented “strongly agree” . Confirmatory factor analysis showed that two items , namely “I believe the various conspir - acy theories on media are totally bullshit ( item 5 ) ” , and “there is no reason not to trust the gov - ernment , intelligence department and media ( item 8 ) ” , were reversely related to the construct and were therefore dismissed . The remaining items demonstrated factor loadings above 0 . 6 , indicating their strong association with the construct . After excluding the two reversed items , the scale showed high internal consistency with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0 . 97 . Anger and fear . Anger and fear were assessed using single - item measures . Participants were asked to rate their level of agreement with the statements : “The influences of the Covid - 19 pandemic are rising anger / fear in me . ” Responses were recorded on a seven - point Likert scale , ranging from 1 ( “completely disagree” ) to 7 ( “completely agree” ) . Institutional distrust . The institutional distrust of participants was measured with eight items , focusing on how much participants trusted in the mainstream accounts and official PLOS ONE Emotional - cognitive mechanismunderlying conspiracymentality and Covid - 19preventive behaviors PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0294681 November16 , 2023 6 / 18 news about Covid - 19 and the pandemic . Statements were as follows : “I believe the news related to the pandemic is guided / is misleading / is more serious than the facts / is excessively sensation - alized / contains elements of exaggeration , ” “When I hear news related to the pandemic , I need to spend more time thinking about it / I need to spend more time thinking about how to mini - mize the impact of the news . ” Participants were asked to rate their agreement with these state - ments on a seven - point Likert scale , where 1 indicated “completely disagree” and 7 indicated “completely agree” . Higher scores on this scale reflected greater distrust towards the media and news reports related to Covid - 19 . In the confirmatory factor analysis , it was found the last two statements had a factor loading lower than 0 . 6 and was therefore excluded from further analysis . The remaining statements were retained for analysis . The Cronbach’s α is 0 . 94 for this scale . Perceived risk . Perceived risk was assessed using a scale adapted from the Risk Behavior Diagnosis Scale of Witte [ 61 ] . The scale included three items measuring perceived severity . The original general statements related to threats were modified to specifically address the severity of the Covid - 19 pandemic . Statements employed to measure perceived severity were as follows : “I believe that the pandemic is severe / serious / significant . ” Participants were asked to indicate their level of agreement via a seven - point Likert scale , ranging from 1 ( “completely Table 1 .

The Cronbach’s α is 0 . 90 for this scale . Preventive behavior . In our assessment of preventive behavior , we included behaviors advised by the World Health Organization to self - protect and prevent the spread of Covid - 19 [ 62 ] . Behaviors listed in the questionnaire were handwashing , wearing a face mask , covering the mouth and nose while sneezing , and carrying out social distancing . Participants were ques - tioned about how frequently they conducted these behaviors over the past month via a seven - point Likert scale , ranging from 1 ( “never” ) to 7 ( “always” ) . Higher scores reflecting a greater adherence to health - protective practices . The Cronbach’s α for this scale is 0 . 82 , indicating a good reliability . Data analysis As some measurements presented significant skewness , non - parametric analyses were per - formed . Table 2 presents the details of mean values , standard deviations , and the Spearman’s rank correlation matrix of the measurement variables . The correlational analysis indicated a significant negative correlation between conspiracy mentality and preventive behavior , provid - ing support for H1 . Additionally , anger and institutional distrust displayed significant negative correlation with preventive behavior , and exhibited a positive correlation with each other , par - tially aligning with the proposed mediational patterns in H2 . However , while fear was posi - tively correlated with preventive behavior , the correlation did not reach statistical significance on the 0 . 01 level . To investigate the precise mechanisms through which conspiracy mentality influences pre - ventive behavior , we conducted a path analysis utilizing AMOS 24 . 0 software . The measure - ment variables , except for fear and anger , were employed as latent constructs in the analysis . Fear and anger , represented as a single factor , were included in the model as observed variables . Confirmatory factor analysis To assess the validity of the measurement model , confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA ) was con - ducted before the path analysis , with 6 latent variables constructed by 31 observed indicators . Fear and anger were each represented by a single factor with no unique variables . Convergent validity was evaluated based on the following criteria : factor loadings , reliability measured by Cronbach’s α , and average variance extracted ( AVE ) . Specifically , two items from the conspiracy mentality scale , two items from the institutional distrust scale , and one item from the preventive behavior scale were excluded from the model since their factor loadings Table 2 .

All the factor loadings of the remaining observed indicators were higher than 0 . 6 . All AVE values for the measurements exceeded 0 . 5 . The Cronbach’s α values of all the measurements exceeded 0 . 8 as displayed above , indicating a good convergent validity . Dis - criminant validity was evaluated by contrasting the values of AVE with the maximum shared squared variance ( MSV ) . These comparisons revealed that the AVE values for all the measure - ment variables were greater than their corresponding MSV values , indicating good discrimi - nant validity . With regards to the overall model fit , results of indexes proved to be satisfactory . Chi - square test : CMIN / DF = 5 . 476 , RMSEA = 0 . 049 ( < 0 . 05 ) , GFI = 0 . 924 ( > 0 . 9 ) , AGFI = 0 . 908 ( > 0 . 9 ) , CFI = 0 . 962 ( > 0 . 95 ) , SRMR = 0 . 051 ( < 0 . 06 ) . We therefore concluded the measurement model is fit for further analysis . Path analysis We constructed the whole structural equation model to test our hypotheses and examine the mediating processes after the validation of the measurement model . Correlational analyses showed significant associations between participant demographics , including age and educa - tional level , with conspiracy mentality , fear and anger . Therefore , age and educational level were incorporated in the path analysis model as control variables . Educational level was quan - tified in terms of years of education , reflecting the highest level of educational attainment . The fit indices of the model are as follows . Due to the sensitivity of χ 2 to sample size , indexes including RMSEA , GFI , AGFI , CFI , and SRMR were also reported . According to Kline [ 63 ] , if the RMSEA value is lower than 0 . 05 , it can be accepted as a good approximate fit , and the range between 0 . 05 and 0 . 08 suggested a reasonable fit . Hu and Bentler [ 64 ] noted that a cut of value close to 0 . 95 for CFI and a cutoff value close to 0 . 08 for SRMR can be considered as indi - cators for a satisfactory model fit . According to these criteria , the path analysis proved to be an overall good fit : CMIN / DF = 4 . 66 ( < 5 ) , RMSEA = 0 . 044 ( < 0 . 05 ) , GFI = 0 . 930 ( > 0 . 9 ) , AGFI = 0 . 916 ( > 0 . 9 ) , CFI = 0 . 964 ( > 0 , 95 ) , and SRMR = 0 . 036 ( < 0 . 05 ) . The control variables included in the model were also examined with their relationships with measurement variables . Results showed that educational level had a negative correlation with both anger ( β = - 0 . 105 , se = 0 . 020 , p < 0 . 001 ) and institutional distrust ( β = - 0 . 074 , se = 0 . 018 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Age had a positive correlation with perceived risk ( β = 0 . 094 , se = 0 . 022 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Results indicated that people with higher educational attainment were associated with fewer emotions of anger and less institutional distrust , while elderly people experienced higher perceptions of risk faced with the pandemic . H1 posits that individuals scoring higher in conspiracy mentality are expected to demon - strate reduced engagement in preventive behavior during the pandemic . In support of H1 , the total effect of conspiracy mentality on preventive behavior was - 0 . 107 ( se = 0 . 026 , p < 0 . 001 , 95 % bias - corrected confidence interval = - 0 . 157 , - 0 . 055 ) , signifying that conspiracy mentality is associated with significantly less engagement in preventive behavior . H2 probes into the mediating effects of emotions and cognitive factors in the process by which conspiracy mentality leads to reduced adoption of preventive behavior . To validate the mediation effects , a bootstrap test was conducted using 2 , 000 bootstrap resamples . Results showed significant indirect effects from conspiracy mentality to preventive behavior ( β = - 0 . 110 , se = 0 . 024 , p < 0 . 001 , 95 % bias - corrected confidence interval = - 0 . 158 , - 0 . 062 ) . These findings indicated that the chains of anger leading to institutional distrust and fear leading to perceived risk serve as significant mediators between conspiracy mentality and engagement in preventive behavior , thus supporting H2 . Accounting for these significant mediational path - ways , the direct effect from conspiracy mentality to preventive behavior was not significant ( β PLOS ONE Emotional - cognitive mechanismunderlying conspiracymentality and Covid - 19preventive behaviors PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0294681 November16 , 2023 9 / 18 = 0 . 002 , se = 0 . 032 , p = 0 . 898 , 95 % bias - corrected confidence interval = - 0 . 056 , 0 . 067 ) . This suggests the effect from conspiracy mentality to preventive behavior was fully mediated by the two pathways . Additionally , it is noteworthy that the effect from conspiracy mentality to media trust was partially mediated by anger , with a significant yet relatively small indirect effect of 0 . 097 ( the ratio of indirect effect to the total effect is 16 . 1 % ) . On the other hand , fear fully mediated the relationship between conspiracy mentality and perceived risk ( direct effect = 0 . 059 , se = 0 . 027 , p = 0 . 021 , 95 % bias - corrected confidence interval = 0 . 009 , 0 . 115 , which was not significant accounting for the mediation effect ) . This implies that the effect of conspiracy mentality on perceived risk primarily operates through the path of fear , while increased institutional trust is more directly influenced by conspiracy mentality itself , with only partial mediation by the emotion of anger . The details of the total , direct and indirect effects of the proposed mediational pathways are presented in Table 3 . H3 explores the divergent effects of anger and fear in the mediational processes . It is hypothesized that conspiracy mentality is simultaneously associated with increased anger and fear . While anger predicts increased institutional distrust , and reduced protective health behavior , fear is expected to be linked with heighten perceived risk , leading to greater adher - ence to preventive behavior . The results of path analysis supported the hypotheses . Conspiracy mentality was found to be a significant positive predictor for both anger ( β = 0 . 420 , se = 0 . 023 , p < 0 . 001 ) and fear ( β = 0 . 393 , se = 0 . 024 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Anger was positively correlated with institutional distrust ( β = 0 . 231 , se = 0 . 024 , p < 0 . 001 ) , and institutional distrust was a negative predictor of preventive behavior ( β = - 0 . 303 , se = 0 . 032 , p < 0 . 001 ) . On the other hand , fear was found to be a positive predictor of perceived risk ( β = 0 . 425 , se = 0 . 026 , p < 0 . 001 ) , and perceived risk was associated with higher engagement in preventive behavior ( β = 0 . 343 , Table 3 .

To conclude , higher levels of anger among people with elevated conspir - acy mentality sparked more distrust in mainstream accounts and official media , ultimately resulting in reduced engagement preventive behavior . Conversely , the heightened fear , driven by conspiracy mentality during times of threat , led to greater perceptions of risk and increased participation in preventive behavior . Fig 2 presents the revised model with detailed validating results of the hypotheses . Discussion The COVID - 19 pandemic has sparked extensive conspiracy theories and instilled strong nega - tive emotions , particularly in the age of the proliferation of social media platforms [ 65 , 66 ] . The negative consequences of conspiracy mentality are especially concerning during global health emergencies since it may hinder individuals from adhering to government health guide - lines [ 43 , 67 ] . China’s strict three - year " zero - COVID " policy , followed by a dramatic relaxa - tion , provides a valuable case to explore the impact of conspiracy mentality on individuals’ preventive behaviors during a public health crisis , as well as the possible emotional and cogni - tive mediators involved . We conducted an online survey among Chinese citizens during the relaxation phase of China’s " zero - COVID " policy , which occurred from March 30 to April 18 , 2023 . The results supported our hypothesis that conspiracy mentality is linked to a reduced adoption of preventive health practices aimed at mitigating the spread of COVID - 19 . There was also evidence that emotions , including anger and fear , and cognitive factors like institu - tional distrust and perceived risk , could mediate the relationship between conspiracy mentality and individuals’ coping behaviors . Firstly , conspiracy mentality has been a prominent feature of the pandemic , resulting in disastrous consequences . It is not an effective approach for dealing with threats and uncer - tainty ; instead , it reinforces negative experiences . In a global health crisis like the COVID - 19 pandemic , characterized by rapid spread and high mortality rates , individuals face significant uncertainty and threats . Research has demonstrated that feelings of uncertainty have the potential to foster conspiracy beliefs [ 68 ] . In other words , when people perceive a lack of con - trol and order in the world , they may turn to conspiracy beliefs as a means of restoring a sense of order and control . This aligns with the compensatory control theory [ 69 ] , which suggests that individuals experiencing a loss of personal control seek compensatory mechanisms to Fig 2 .

The detailed results of H1 and H2 can be found in Table 3 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0294681 . g002 PLOS ONE Emotional - cognitive mechanismunderlying conspiracymentality and Covid - 19preventive behaviors PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0294681 November16 , 2023 11 / 18 restore order , such as believing in a controlling God , a highly competent government , or even embracing abstract beliefs . Despite their commonly malevolent assumptions , conspiracy theo - ries provide a framework for understanding events that threaten the established order [ 15 , 70 ] . From this perspective , conspiracy mentality could be a compensatory control mechanism . However , contrary to beneficial consequences , our findings indicate that conspiracy mentality might actually exacerbate negative emotions such as anger and fear , thereby hindering the adoption of protective measures during a pandemic . This aligns with the perspective in the existing literature [ 9 ] that conspiracy beliefs establish a self - reinforcing cycle characterized by distrust , uncertainty , and conspiratorial thinking . According to AIT , pandemic threats have the potential to evoke anger and fear , both of which are closely linked to conspiracy mentality . This finding contributes to the body of exist - ing literature , which already identifies conspiracy mentality as a risk factor for experiencing negative emotions during Covid - 19 lockdowns [ 43 – 46 ] . Moreover , our findings revealed that individuals with high levels of conspiracy mentality during a health crisis tend to exhibit signif - icantly greater distrust in pandemic - related information and perceive the crisis as more threat - ening . These results are consistent with the existing literature concerning the cognitive outcomes of conspiracy mentality , encompassing distrust in institutions and mainstream nar - ratives [ 26 , 47 ] , as well as heightened sensitivity to risks or threats during external events [ 5 , 43 , 51 , 53 ] . We also expanded our research to explore the mediating process through which conspiracy mentality influences preventive behaviors by way of negative emotions , institutional distrust , and perceived risks . In accordance with AIT , threats generate anger and fear with very differ - ent cognitive and behavioral consequences . Fear increases the perception of risk and further encourages a powerful response , but anger removes the trust in institution and reduces the preventive behaviors . More specifically , the mediating effects of these two paths work in con - tradictory directions : individuals with higher conspiracy mentality experience increased levels of both anger and fear . Greater anger is associated with increased distrust in mainstream accounts and official media , resulting in reduced adoption of protective behaviors . Conversely , heightened fear increases the perception of risk and ultimately results in greater engagement in preventive behaviors . Notably , distrust seems to have a stronger and more stable association with conspiracy mentality as a trait , and it is less influenced by emotions . Additionally , it has a more adverse impact on compliance with preventive measures compared to perceptions of risk . Furthermore , our results corroborate previous findings indicating that individuals with higher levels of conspiracy mentality are less likely to engage in effective measures to protect themselves from Covid - related risks [ 10 ] . This can primarily be attributed to the negative effects of increased anger and institutional distrust , which overshadow the positive influence of fear and perceived risk . These findings provide an explanation for the seemingly paradoxical observation that individuals with higher levels of conspiracy mentality engage in fewer protec - tive behaviors , even though they perceive the crisis as more threatening . This behavioral pat - tern can be likened to the classic “freeze response” observed in individuals faced with sudden threats or stressful events . In such situations , individuals may be highly alert but find them - selves unable to take action or respond effectively to the perceived danger . Some literature has summarized this response as a state of “attentive mobility” [ 71 ] . Similar to individuals’ instant responses under pressure , their reaction mode during external crises is determined by their emotions and perceptions of the events . In the case of individuals with conspiracy mentality , their psychological response process should be attributed to the effects of anger and institu - tional distrust , rather than solely focusing on their superficial perception of higher risks . This finding is consistent with previous literature , which has also demonstrated a link between PLOS ONE Emotional - cognitive mechanismunderlying conspiracymentality and Covid - 19preventive behaviors PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0294681 November16 , 2023 12 / 18 belief in conspiracy theories and behaviors such as medical inactivity or non - compliance with medical treatments [ 3 , 6 , 8 , 54 , 55 ] . Limitations Several factors need to be considered when interpreting the results of this study . Firstly , findings of this research are based on a convenience sample limited to Chinese adults with Internet access , which is typically comprised of a younger and more highly edu - cated demographic than the overall population . In an effort to reduce potential biases in our estimates , we included age and educational level as control variables in our model . Previous research has indicated that Covid - 19 disproportionately affects the elderly , and individuals aged 60 and above may hold distinct beliefs and behaviors in relation to the pandemic [ 72 , 73 ] . However , the limited number of respondents aged 60 and above in our sample continues to limit the generalizability of our conclusions primarily to young adults and middle - aged individuals . Additionally , the use of a self - report methodology to assess emotions and coping behaviors introduced the potential for response biases and common - method variance . These measures might be susceptible to personal interpretation , which could potentially impact the accuracy of the responses . Despite our efforts to ensure the reliability of the measures and conduct data quality checks , the reliance on self - reported data inherently introduced limitations . Another limitation is the use of a cross - sectional dataset . The data utilized in this study was collected between March and April 2023 , which corresponds to the later stages of the Covid - 19 crisis in China . During this period , the " zero - covid " policy had been relaxed , and mass Covid - 19 testing had ceased . It is important to note that we collected the data just after the peak of widespread contamination across the country [ 74 ] , indicating that the period can still be con - sidered a crisis for Chinese residents . Unfortunately , despite conducting a similar survey dur - ing the initial outbreak of Covid - 19 , we were unable to obtain a sufficient number of first - wave samples . This limitation prevented us from validating our model using a longitudinal dataset . The cross - sectional design inherently lacks the ability to conclusively establish causality , restricting our capacity to definitively discern the direction of the relationship between con - spiracy mentality and preventive behavior . However , given that conspiracy mentality tends to be a relatively stable disposition involving belief in conspiracy theories over time [ 26 ] , we cau - tiously identified it as a founding factor leading to emotions , cognitions , and corresponding behaviors . Additionally , we were unable to capture the changes in preventive behavior of indi - viduals with higher levels of conspiracy mentality over time . This limitation hampers our understanding of the long - term and dynamic nature of this relationship . To address these limitations , future research may benefit from employing complementary study designs . For instance , studies focusing on elderly samples could provide valuable insights given the unique beliefs and behaviors of this demographic in a pandemic . Longitudinal stud - ies or experiments could offer a more comprehensive understanding of the casual relationship between conspiracy mentality and preventive behavior faced with threats and crises . Conclusion This study has provided an exploration of the intricate mechanism by which conspiracy men - tality influences individuals’ preventive health behaviors during a public health crisis like the COVID - 19 pandemic . Importantly , our findings have shown that fear heightens the percep - tion of risk and motivates a strong self - protective response , whereas anger erodes trust in insti - tutions and reduces compliance . PLOS ONE Emotional - cognitive mechanismunderlying conspiracymentality and Covid - 19preventive behaviors PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0294681 November16 , 2023 13 / 18 By revealing the negative correlation between conspiracy mentality and individuals’ engagement in preventive behaviors , along with the mediating pathways involving emotions and cognitive factors , we have developed a preliminary model to clarify this intricate process . The psychological responses of individuals with elevated levels of conspiracy mentality when confronted with environmental risks or threats can be likened to a state of “attentive immobil - ity” , a phenomenon akin to the classic " freeze response " mode [ 71 ] . Mediated by the emotion of fear , these individuals experience an increased perception of risk associated with the crisis . Nevertheless , partially mediated by the emotion of anger , they also manifest heightened dis - trust towards mainstream accounts , experts , and health authorities . The impact of this distrust surpasses the effects of perceived risk , impeding their ability to take effective containment actions . Consequently , individuals with high conspiracy mentality tend to exhibit reduced engagement in preventive behaviors , even though they may possess a heightened awareness of potential risks . These findings underscore the critical importance of comprehending the rami - fications of conspiracy theories and the need to implement effective communication strategies aimed at disrupting cognitive and responsive processes . In conclusion , by applying Affective Intelligence Theory , this study expands our under - standing of how conspiracy mentality influences individuals’ preventive behaviors during pub - lic health crises and provides valuable insights into its mediating process comprised by emotional and cognitive factors . Our research also provides a valuable case study focused on Chinese examples of Covid - 19 conspiracy theories and their psychological implications . This adds a culturally specific dimension to the understanding of the ramification of conspiracy mentality , especially its impact on public health responses . By acknowledging the detrimental impact of conspiracy theories on individuals’ compliance to health guidelines , policymakers , public health professionals , and officials can develop targeted strategies , including debunking projects , to combat conspiracy mentality and foster effective coping modes during future acute health crises .
