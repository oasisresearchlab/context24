Mçller , [ b , e ] Anne Imberty , [ d ] and Alexander Titz * [ a , b , c ] Introduction The Gram - negative and opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major threat to hospitalized and immune - com - promised patients . [ 1 ] Unfortunately , many hospital strains are getting largely unaffected by many antibiotics . [ 2 ] This resistance results from the presence of drug - neutralizing tools in P . aeru - ginosa , for example , beta - lactamases or efflux pumps , but also from its potential to form biofilms . In these biofilms , bacteria are embedded in a self - produced matrix , which protects against host immune defense and antibiotic treatment . [ 3 , 4 ] Two lectins produced by P . aeruginosa , LecA ( PA - IL ) and LecB ( PA - IIL ) , play key roles in biofilm formation , and both lectins are virulence factors involved in host damage and bacterial uptake . [ 5 – 10 ] Inhibition of these lectins as an anti - infective strat - egy belongs to the new concept of antivirulence therapies . [ 11 ] In contrast to antibiotics targeting bacterial viability , antiviru - lence therapeutics solely target the infection without interfer - ence on viability and therefore the appearance of resistant mu - tants is decreased . [ 12 ] In a proof of concept study for therapeu - tic suitability of the lectins LecA and LecB as target , Hauber et al . could show a decrease in bacterial load after treatment of pulmonary - infected patients with an aerosol containing nat - ural ligands of both lectins . [ 13 ] The carbohydrate - binding protein LecB was first isolated by Gilboa – Garber et al . , and its glycan preference was deter - mined . [ 14 , 15 ] The crystal structure of LecB in complex with its high - affinity ligand l - fucose revealed the presence of two calci - um ions , which mediate binding between the saccharide and the protein . [ 16 ] A subsequent study could show that the lower - affinity ligand d - mannose binds similarly to LecB as a conse - quence of three hydroxy groups with identical relative orienta - tion in both l - fucose and d - mannose . [ 17 ] The trisaccharide Lewis a was identified from glycan array analysis and is currently its best known monovalent ligand with a thermodynamic dis - sociation constant of 210 n m . [ 18 , 19 ] Numerous multivalent inhib - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic Gram - negative pathogen with high antibiotic resistance . Its lectin LecB was identified as a virulence factor and is relevant in bacterial ad - hesion and biofilm formation . Inhibition of LecB with carbohy - drate - based ligands results in a decrease in toxicity and biofilm formation . We recently discovered two classes of potent drug - like glycomimetic inhibitors , that is , sulfonamides and cinna - mides of d - mannose . Here , we describe the chemical synthesis and biochemical evaluation of more than 20 derivatives with increased potency compared to the unsubstituted cinnamide . The structure – activity relationship ( SAR ) obtained and the ex - tended biophysical characterization allowed the experimental determination of the binding mode of these cinnamides with LecB . The established surface binding mode now allows future rational structure - based drug design . Importantly , all glycomi - metics tested showed extended receptor residence times with half - lives in the 5 – 20 min range , a prerequisite for therapeutic application . Thus , the glycomimetics described here provide an excellent basis for future development of anti - infectives against this multidrug - resistant pathogen . [ a ] R . Sommer , D . Hauck , Dr . S .

[ 20 , 21 ] One multivalent fucosylated peptide dendrimer was shown to be a high - affinity ligand with the potential to in - hibit biofilm formation and disperse established biofilms of P . aeruginosa in a LecB - dependent fashion . [ 22 ] In contrast , the development of monovalent inhibitors has been largely ne - glected due to their intrinsically lower affinities and efforts are summarized in recent reviews . [ 23 , 24 ] We recently reported the discovery of derivatives of d - man - nose with amido - and sulfonamido substituents at position 6 ( 2 and 3 , Figure 1 ) . [ 25 ] Compared with the parent low - affinity ligand methyl mannoside ( 1 , Figure 1 ) , [ 26 ] these modifications improved binding affinity between four - and 24 - fold . In con - trast to a - l - fucosides , d - mannose as scaffold provided the pos - sibility to target an adjacent cleft on the protein in order to in - crease binding affinity . Because in the crystal structure of LecB with d - mannose , [ 17 ] a hydrogen bond between its 6 - OH and Ser23 was observed , particular attention was paid to this hy - droxy group in the design of new inhibitors . [ 25 , 27 , 28 ] However , we could show through chemical modification that this hydro - gen bond does not have a significant influence on binding af - finity at ambient conditions in aqueous solution . [ 27 , 28 ] In our previous study , we succeeded in obtaining a co - crystal struc - ture of sulfonamide 2 in complex with LecB . In the absence of a crystal structure for cinnamide 3 in complex with LecB , mo - lecular dynamics simulations and NMR suggested an intercala - tion of the cinnamide residue into the beta - sandwich of the lectin . [ 25 ] Here , we describe the synthesis of a set of more than 20 substituted cinnamido derivatives to establish the structure – activity relationship ( SAR ) of the interaction of this class of in - hibitors with LecB . Furthermore , we used a diverse set of dif - ferent biophysical techniques to establish the binding mode of this class of LecB inhibitors . Results and Discussion In the predicted binding mode of cinnamide 3 , the aromatic moiety opens a cleft in the protein and intercalates into the beta - sandwich formed by one LecB monomer . In order to get a more detailed picture of the interaction of such cinnamides with LecB , we performed a structure – activity study with a varie - ty of substituents in ortho - , meta - , and para - position of the cin - namic amide residue of 3 . The synthesis of the cinnamide de - rivatives started from methyl a - d - mannoside ( 1 ) . Introduction of an amino functional group allowed amide bond formation with unprotected mannose derivative 4 with a set of selected commercially available cinnamic acid derivatives . Various sub - stituents were introduced in ortho - , meta - , or para - position re - sulting in the potential LecB inhibitors 5a – e , 5g – k , and 5m – q , respectively , which were obtained in moderate to good yields ( Scheme 1 ) . The nitro derivatives 5e , 5k , and 5q were further Figure 1 .

[ 29 ] for aliphatic nitro groups to give the corresponding anilines 5 f , 5l , and 5r in high yields . Furthermore , we synthe - sized the more rigid 2 - naphtoyl derivative 6 as a cyclized analog of 3 , as well as the two disubstituted analogs 7a and 7b following the same protocol . All synthesized compounds were then biochemically evalu - ated for inhibition of LecB using a competitive binding assay based on fluorescence polarization readout , recently devel - oped for LecB in our lab . [ 25 ] Surprisingly , all monosubstituted compounds were within a narrow activity range with IC 50 values from 27 – 73 m m , indicating that the substituents tested had a moderate effect on the activity that remains similar to the parent cinnamide 3 with an IC 50 of 37 m m ( Figure 2 ) . Intro - duction of ortho substituents in 5a – f generally resulted in weaker inhibition of LecB ( IC 50 49 – 73 m m ) , while the same sub - stituents in meta - or para - position ( 5g – l and 5m – r ) showed similar or enhanced potency with IC 50 values ranging from 27 – 53 m m . The decreased affinity of ortho - substituted 5a – f might result from a steric hindrance with the receptor . Generally , the introduction of polar substitu - ents such as phenolic hydroxy groups or aniline - NH 2 led to a de - creased affinity ( 5b , 5 f , 5h , 5l , 5n , 5r ) , whereas the presence of the lipophilic substituents chloro , methoxy , or methyl re - sulted in enhanced potencies especially in meta or para posi - tion ( 5g , 5i , 5j , and 5m , 5o , 5p ) . Methoxy - substituted cinna - mides were superior inhibitors in the ortho , meta , and para series , with highest potencies for meta - 5i and para - 5o . We therefore combined both substituents in one molecule as 3 , 4 - methylenedioxy derivative 7a or 3 , 4 - dimethoxycinnamide 7b to analyze potential synergistic effects . Both compounds showed good inhibition of LecB with dimethoxy - substituted 7b as the most potent inhibitor at an IC 50 of 19 . 9 m m . Methyle - nedioxy derivative 7a had an IC 50 of 29 m m , which was compa - rable to singly meta - or para - methoxy - substituted 5i and 5o . In addition , we tested the cyclized analog 6 bearing a 2 - naphtamide in lieu of the cinnamide moiety for LecB inhibi - tion . In accordance with the general trend of higher affinities for more lipophilic substituents among all tested compounds , compound 6 also displayed an increased inhibitory potency ( IC 50 31 m m ) . The 2 - naphtamide 6 is structurally similar to ortho - substituted cinnamides 5a – f , especially to the 2 - methyl derivative 5d . Generally , steric hindrance with the receptor , Figure 2 .

KGaA , Weinheim 758 a distorted planarity of the cinnamide moiety , or even a further increase of the already high rotational barrier due to the ortho - substituents in 5a – f could account for the decreased affinity in the ortho - series . Possible reasons for the difference in activity between 6 and 5a – f cannot be deduced from the present data set . Although a rather flat SAR on the substituents of the cinnamic acid moiety was obtained , a two - fold increase in po - tency compared to unsubstituted cinnamide 3 could be ach - ieved through introduction of two methoxy substituents in meta - and para position in 7b . Can this SAR at the cinnamide residue explain the previously proposed intercalation model of the binding of 3 to LecB ? During our previous structural characterization of the cinna - mide 3 – LecB interaction , we observed global line broadening of the protein signals at a protein – ligand ratio of 2 : 1 ; a stoi - chiometric ratio of 1 : 1 led to complete vanishing of resonances and visual precipitation of protein after a few hours of record - ing time . In contrast , the same analysis with sulfonamide 2 yielded distinct shifts of a small set of protein resonances . The protein NMR spectra were interpreted , such that the computa - tionally predicted intercalation of 3 into the beta - sandwich of LecB leads to a global effect on its structure and , thus , results in changes of most of the protein resonances . In order to analyze whether the observed effects on LecB in - duced by cinnamide 3 are carbohydrate - specific and to ex - clude simple detergent - like denaturation of the protein , we de - signed its glucose - analog 10 . The compound was synthesized in analogy to 3 : methyl a - d - glucoside ( 8 ) was transformed into the tosylate and subsequently the azide 9 was obtained after sodium azide treatment as previously reported by Cramer et al . [ 30 ] ( Scheme 2 ) . The azide was hydrogenolytically reduced using palladium on activated charcoal , and the resulting amine was directly coupled with cinnamic acid to yield gluco - cinnamide 10 in good yield ( 46 % over two steps ) . The control compound gluco - 10 was then tested in the com - petitive binding assay to assess the carbohydrate - based specif - icity of cinnamide manno - 3 . No inhibition of LecB function up to 3 m m of gluco - cinnamide 10 was observed ( Figure 3 ) , whereas manno - 3 showed inhibition in a dose - dependent manner as previously reported . This assay relies on the dis - placement of a fucose - fluorescein conjugate as detection probe bound to intact LecB . The observed high fluorescence polarization even at high concentrations of gluco - 10 therefore indicated persistent binding of the fluorescent probe and thus the absence of any kind of inhibitory influence of gluco - 10 on LecB function . In summary , there was no unspecific binding of the cinnamide moiety at elevated ligand concentrations , but the effects observed with manno - 3 were instead dependent on the stereochemistry of one single hydroxy group and thus on the specific binding to the carbohydrate recognition site of LecB . To further study the interaction of the most potent cinna - mide with LecB , compound 7b was then titrated to LecB , and the thermodynamics of binding were analyzed by isothermal microcalorimetry ( ITC , Figure 4 , Table 1 ) . A K d value of 10 . 9 m m with a stoichiometry of 1 was determined , and binding enthal - py and entropy were obtained . In comparison to sulfona - mide 2 , both cinnamide 3 and dimethoxycinnamide 7b showed a reduced binding enthalpy , but in contrast to 2 , Figure 3 . Inhibition of LecB by manno - 3 is carbohydrate - specific , and the control compound gluco - 10 has no effect up to a concentration of 3 m m on LecB functional binding to the fucosylated fluorescent probe of the assay system .

KGaA , Weinheim 759 a beneficial contribution of binding entropy to the Gibbs free energy . Subsequently , we performed surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) analysis to determine the parameters of binding kinetics of LecB with its ligands . LecB was biotinylated using an acti - vated carboxylic acid derivative of biotin and coupled to the sur - face of a streptavidin - coated sensor chip . High surface densi - ties of LecB were obtained , which is necessary for the detec - tion of small molecule binding . Methyl mannoside ( 1 ) , sulfona - mide 2 , cinnamide 3 , and its de - rivative 7b , which showed the highest potency among the cin - namide series in LecB inhibition , were analyzed by SPR ( Figure 5 , Table 2 ) . Unmodified manno - side 1 showed fast binding ki - netics , which are usually ob - served with lectin – carbohydrate interactions . [ 31 ] The measured K d of 47 m m was in good agree - ment with the previously deter - mined thermodynamic value of 71 m m by ITC . [ 26 ] Sulfonamide 2 showed a two - fold higher on rate and a very slow off rate of 6 . 2(cid:213)10 ¢ 4 s ¢ 1 . The half - life ( t 1 / 2 = ln2 / k off ) of the complex of LecB and sulfonamide 2 was 18 . 6 min , explaining its very high affinity ( K d = 1 . 12 m m by SPR , 3 . 3 m m [ 25 ] by ITC ) towards LecB compared to a t 1 / 2 of only 45 s for 1 . It is important to note , that long drug - receptor half lives are im - portant for in vivo function and future success for drug develop - ment . [ 32 , 33 ] When analyzing cin - namide 3 , slow binding kinetics approaching the detection limit of the apparatus were observed with a k on of 100 . 9 m ¢ 1 s ¢ 1 , which was threefold slower than mannoside 1 and more than fivefold slower than sulfonamide 2 . Its dimethoxy derivative 7b also showed a slow on rate with a k on of 169 . 6 m ¢ 1 s ¢ 1 , indicating a similar mode of binding to LecB for 3 and 7b . The dissocia - tion constant of 18 . 1 m m for 3 was in very good agreement with its previously determined value of 18 . 5 m m [ 25 ] by calorime - try . The most potent cinnamide derivative dimethoxycinnami - de 7b showed a K d by SPR of 7 . 7 m m and a complex half - life t 1 / 2 of 8 . 8 min , demonstrating the high potential of this series for further drug development . The very slow on rates observed for the cinnamides 3 and 7b could result from a conformational change within the protein upon binding , in favor of the previ - ously proposed intercalation model or from conformational changes within the ligand .

KGaA , Weinheim 760 Analysis of LecB and its complex with cinnamide by circular dichroism ( CD ) spectroscopy could yield insight on conforma - tional changes induced by ligand binding . Interestingly howev - er , we did not observe significant differences in the CD spectra of LecB with 3 or LecB alone , and both spectra were indicative of beta - sheets as the predominant secondary structure ( Fig - ure 6A ) . Then , a thermal denaturation of LecB in presence and absence of cinnamide 3 was performed to assess the influence of 3 on protein stability ( Figure 6B ) . The CD spectrum of LecB was stable between 37 8 C and up to above 90 8 C , and no de - fined melting point ( T m ) could be determined as shown in Fig - ure 6B for the ellipticity at 229 nm . In presence of com - pound 3 , only slight differences were detected with somewhat bigger changes without ligand . Further attempts to analyze T m of LecB with a set of compounds by thermal shift analysis using SYPRO(cid:210) Orange also failed to give signals for unfolded protein ( data not shown ) . The lack of success in both thermal unfolding techniques presumably originates in the extraordina - ry high thermal stability of LecB . [ 14 ] Based on the high degree of structural similarity of cinna - mide 3 and dimethoxycinnamide 7b and their similar binding kinetics , we anticipated comparable binding modes and thus also a similar behavior on protein NMR signals . Surprisingly , the 1 H , 15 N - TROSY - HSQC ( transverse relaxation - optimized spec - troscopy – heteronuclear single quantum coherence ) NMR spec - trum of 15 N - labelled LecB showed only distinct shifts of protein resonances in the presence of 7b , and even saturation of LecB with dimethoxycinnamide 7b could be achieved at excellent quality of the spectra ( Figure 7B ) . In contrast to our previously reported data for LecB in complex with the unsubstituted cin - namide 3 , no global vanishing of signal intensity was observed with dimethoxycinnamide 7b . The behavior observed with 7b rather resembles the spectra obtained with sulfonamide 2 and thus a distinctly defined binding site . After an extensive search for crystallization conditions of LecB with cinnamide 3 , we finally obtained protein crystals which diffracted to 1 . 6 (cid:230) and allowed structure determination ( Figure 8 , Table 3 ) . Both , the mannose part and the cinnamide residue were well defined and present in every binding site of the LecB tetramer ( Figure 8A ) . Interestingly , this crystal struc - ture shows a surface binding of the cinnamide as opposed to the computational model suggesting the intercalation of the aromatic moiety into the protein . [ 25 ] The asymmetric unit con - tains one tetramer of LecB with one ligand molecule per mo - nomer . In the overlay of ligand binding sites , a high variability between the ligand conformation in the four binding sites can be observed ( Figure 8A ) . The mannose residue always adopts the same binding pose , whereas the cinnamide side chain is oriented in three different orientations . After closer examina - tion of the structure , we identified extended p – p stacking con - tacts between the cinnamide part of two ligands from a neigh - boring LecB tetramer in the crystal lattice . In only one out of the four binding sites , the cinnamide substituent is in contact with the protein surface , forming van der Waals contacts with Gly97 and Thr98 and a water mediated hydrogen bond with Ser23 ( Figure 8B ) . In the other three binding sites , the cinnam - ic acid residues form extended interligand p – p stacking con - tacts in the crystal lattice . It is well known that crystal lattice contacts can induce certain conformations of ligands or flexi - ble regions in proteins , which sometimes do not occur in solu - tion . [ 34 ] In solution , however , the three binding modes lacking protein contact of the cinnamide are unlikely to occur . The binding mode observed for the fourth pose with the cinna - mide having a lipophilic contact with the protein surface could explain the flat SAR , that is a narrow range of inhibitory activi - ties , obtained . In order to further understand the distinctly different charac - teristics of the interaction of LecB with the cinnamide ligands observed by protein NMR spectroscopy , we analyzed inhibitor - mediated aggregation of LecB . Besides intermediate exchange phenomena or protein unfolding , aggregation also leads to loss in observed signal intensity by NMR spectroscopy . To quantify the compounds’ effect on protein aggregation , we Table 2 .

KGaA , Weinheim 761 performed titration experiments with a constant concentration of LecB and measured aggregation via light scattering at 600 nm ( OD 600 ) . Surprisingly , we did not observe measurable light scattering for dimethoxycinnamide 7b between 14 m m and 1 . 7 m m , but intense and spontaneous aggregation for cin - namide 3 at 510 m m and above , which could explain the dis - tinct differences observed by NMR spectroscopy ( Figure 9 ) . Sul - fonamide 2 , as well as the gluco - cinnamide 10 , showed no light scattering under identical conditions ; all compounds tested in absence of LecB were also translucent across the entire concentration range . We thus concluded that unsubstituted cinnamide 3 dimerizes or even oligomerizes at high concentra - tions . These oligomers may act as multivalent anchor points that attract individual LecB tet - ramers and promote aggrega - tion and precipitation . This ag - gregation can explain the global vanishing of signal intensity in 1 H , 15 N - TROSY - HSQC NMR experi - ments which was observed for 3 . Introduction of the two me - thoxy - substituents in 7b pre - vents aggregation of LecB prob - ably because the methoxy groups prevent strong p – p - stacking - mediated oligomeriza - tion of compound 7b itself . Conclusions Cinnamides of d - mannose , such as 3 , were previously identified as potent glycomimetic inhibi - tors of LecB , a virulence factor and important biofilm compo - nent of the opportunistic patho - gen P . aeruginosa . [ 25 ] Based on microcalorimetry data and mas - sive line broadening observed in protein NMR spectroscopy sig - nals in the presence of 3 , which may result from global changes in the protein structure and / or aggregation of the protein , we proposed an intercalation bind - ing model . Here , we report an extensive SAR study of substitu - ents at the cinnamide residue of 3 and their influence on binding affinity to LecB . Although a rather flat SAR was obtained , binding affinity of this class of compounds could be further im - proved for LecB . The dimethoxy - substituted compound 7b is the most potent derivative with a seven - fold higher affinity than 1 . The established SAR at the cinnamide residue was , however , not sufficient to explain the previously proposed in - tercalation model of the binding of 3 to LecB . We therefore further analyzed the binding of 3 to LecB using a number of biophysical methods . First , the synthesis and biochemical evaluation of the gluco - analog 10 of manno - cinnamide 3 showed that the inhibition of Figure 7 .

KGaA , Weinheim 762 LecB by compound 3 is specific and strictly carbohydrate depen - dent . Furthermore , the data showed that the inhibitory effect on LecB does not result from an unspecific detergent - like effect of these amphiphilic com - pounds . Kinetic analysis by surface plasmon resonance of the inter - action of LecB with the two manno - cinnamides studied here , 3 and 7b , showed comparable binding kinetics for both com - pounds . Very slow on rates close to the detection limit of the SPR machine , as well as comparable intermediate off rates were de - tected for both compounds . This kinetic data suggests a similar mode of action for the structur - ally highly related compounds cinnamide 3 and dimethoxycinnamide 7b . However , the inter - action study using 1 H , 15 N - TROSY HSQC NMR spectra of LecB in presence of 7b showed distinct shifts of about 15 resonances and was therefore in clear contrast to the behavior of its un - substituted analog 3 . After extensive search for crystallization conditions for the complex of LecB and cinnamide 3 , we suc - ceeded in determining the crystal structure of its complex . Sur - Figure 8 . A ) The crystal structure of the complex of 3 with LecB at 1 . 6 (cid:230) shows a surface binding of the cinnamide residue to the protein . The superposition of all four binding sites indicates coordination of the cinnamic acid resi - due to the protein in one monomer and no interaction with LecB in three of the four monomers . The latter results from extended interligand stacking interactions in neighboring binding sites due to the crystal packing . B ) Surface for monomer 2 with electron density for 3 : the cinnamide substituent forms lipophilic interactions with Gly97 and Thr98 and one water - mediated hydrogen bond via the carbonyl oxygen with Ser23 .

KGaA , Weinheim 763 prisingly , a surface localization of the cinnamide residue in 3 was detected with defined lipophilic interactions and one di - rected hydrophilic hydrogen bond with LecB . It was not until we performed aggregation assays with the compounds stud - ied and LecB , that we could fully explain the nature behind the effects observed . Only unsubstituted cinnamide 3 aggre - gated LecB at high ligand concentrations , similar to those used in NMR experiments . When two methoxy substituents were in - troduced into the structurally highly similar compound 7b , ag - gregation of LecB was no longer observed . Presumably , self - ag - gregation of compound 3 at high concentrations in aqueous solution via its lipophilic cinnamide moiety lead to an apparent multivalency , which precipitated tetravalent LecB . Both cinna - mides showed comparable very slow on - rates in the surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) experiments with LecB , and therefore similar binding modes of 3 and 7b are plausible . A possible conformational change of the protein accounting for these slow on rates is unlikely due to identical orientations of the protein in the crystal structures of the apoprotein , [ 17 ] LecB with 2 [ 25 ] or LecB with 3 ( Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Infor - mation ) . The overlay of the crystal structures of LecB and sulfo - namide 2 with cinnamide 3 also demonstrates the different areas on the lectin targeted by the sulfonamide and the cinna - mide residue , respectively ( Figure S2 in the Supporting Infor - mation ) . Based on these experiments and the crystal structure ob - tained , we could revise the initially proposed intercalation mode for cinnamide - based LecB inhibitors . The knowledge gained from this study now allows the structure - based design of follow - up derivatives of the highly potent cinnamide - based class of glycomimetics as LecB inhibitors . Importantly , all glyco - mimetics tested showed extended receptor residence times with half - lives in the 5 – 20 min range . In contrast , the rapid ki - netics of natural carbohydrate ligands with half - lives in the 45 s range hamper their use as therapeutics . Thus , the glycomi - metics described here provide an excellent basis for future de - velopment of anti - infectives . Experimental Section Chemical synthesis Thin layer chromatography ( TLC ) was performed using silica - gel 60 - coated aluminum sheets containing fluorescence indicator ( Merck KGaA , Darmstadt , Germany ) using UV light ( 254 nm ) and by charring either in anisaldehyde solution ( 1 % v / v 4 - methoxybenzal - dehyde , 2 % v / v concentrated H 2 SO 4 in EtOH ) , in aqueous KMnO 4 solution or in a molybdate solution ( a 0 . 02 m solution of Ce ( NH 4 ) 4 ( SO 4 ) 4 ·2H 2 O and ( NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 ·4H 2 O in aqueous 10 % H 2 SO 4 ) with heating .

Nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker Avance III 400 UltraShield spectrometer ( Bruker Biospin GmbH , Rheinstetten , Germany ) at 400 MHz ( 1 H ) or 101 MHz ( 13 C ) . Chemical shifts are given in ppm and were calibrated on residual solvent peaks as internal standard . [ 35 ] Multiplicities were specified as s ( singlet ) , d ( doublet ) , t ( triplet ) , or m ( multiplet ) . The signals were assigned with the help of 1 H , 1 H - COSY , and DEPT - 135 - edited 1 H , 13 C - HSQC experiments . High - resolution mass spectra ( HRMS ) were obtained on a Bruker micrOTOF II ESI spectrometer , and the data were analyzed using DataAnalysis from Bruker . The NMR and MS data of all synthesized compounds as well as re - action times and mass yields ( Table S1 ) can be found in the Sup - porting Information .

Recombinant expression and purification of P . aeruginosa LecB The protein was expressed and purified as described recently [ 25 ] using E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) and plasmid pET25pa2l . [ 36 ] The purified and lyophilized protein was dissolved in Tris - buffered saline supple - mented with calcium ( TBS / Ca : 20 m m Tris , 137 m m NaCl , 2 . 6 m m KCl at pH 7 . 4 supplemented with 0 . 1 or 1 m m CaCl 2 ) before use , and the concentration was determined by UV spectroscopy at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 6990 m ¢ 1 cm ¢ 1 . [ 37 ] Re - combinant expression and purification of 15 N - labelled LecB was performed using 15 NH 4 Cl as described [ 25 ] following a procedure by Marley et al . [ 38 ] Competitive binding assay The competitive binding assay based on fluorescence polarization was performed as previously described by Hauck et al . [ 25 ] Briefly , a stock solution of LecB ( 20 m L of 225 n m ) and fluorescent reporter ligand N - ( fluorescein - 5 - yl ) - N ’ - ( a - l - fucopyranosyl ethylen ) - thiocarba - mide ( 15 n m ) in TBS / Ca were mixed with serial dilutions ( 10 m L of 1 m m to 12 . 8 n m ) of testing compounds in TBS / Ca in triplicates . After addition of the reagents , the black 384 - well microtiter plates ( Greiner Bio - One , Germany , cat . no . 781900 ) were incubated for 8 – 22 h at rt in a humidity chamber . Fluorescence emission parallel and perpendicular to the excitation plane was measured on a Pher - aStar FS ( BMG Labtech , Ortenberg , Germany ) plate reader or on a Tecan INFINITE F500 plate reader ( Tecan Group Ltd . , M(cid:149)nnedorf , Switzerland ) with excitation filters at 485 nm and emission filters at 535 nm . For measurements on the Tecan INFINITE F500 plate reader , the G - factor was set on 0 . 92154 and the gain to 80 . The measured intensities were decreased by buffer values , and fluores - cence polarization was calculated . The data were analyzed using BMG Labtech MARS software ( v . 3 . 01R2 , 2013 ) and / or with Graph - Pad Prism ( GraphPad Software , Inc . , La Jolla , USA ) and fitted ac - cording to the four - parameter variable - slope model . Bottom and top plateaus were defined by the standard compounds l - fucose and methyl a - d - mannoside , respectively , and the data was reana - lyzed with these values fixed . A minimum of three independent measurements of triplicates each was performed for every ligand . Microcalorimetry Isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) was performed on a MicroCal ITC200 ( GE Healthcare , Freiburg , Germany ) , and the data was ana - lyzed using the MicroCal Origin software ( v . 7 . 0 , 2009 ) . LecB ( 300 – 360 m m ) was dissolved in TBS / Ca ( the concentration was verified by UV spectroscopy , see above ) and placed in the sample cell at 25 8 C . The titration was performed with a solution of 7b ( 3 . 0 – 3 . 5 m m ) in the same buffer . After one preinjection ( 0 . 4 m L ) , 19 injec - tions of 2 m L and 4 s each with a spacing of 460 or 480 s were per - formed . Three independent titrations were run . Surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) measurements SPR binding experiments were performed on a Biacore X100 in - strument ( GE Healthcare , Freiburg , Germany ) at 25 8 C in Hepes - buffered saline ( HBS : 10 m m Hepes / NaOH , pH 7 . 4 , 150 m m NaCl , 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ) at a flow rate of 30 m L min ¢ 1 . LecB was biotinylat - ed using EZ - Link NHS - LC - LC - Biotin ( Pierce , cat . no . 21343 ) following the manufacturer ’ s conditions . Streptavidin ( 7000 RU ) was immobi - lized on a research - grade CM5 chip using standard procedures , and 4200 RU of biotinylated LecB were captured on channel 2 .

KGaA , Weinheim 765 Binding experiments were performed with the LecB - captured chan - nel 2 , and plots represent the subtracted data ( channel 2 – channel 1 ) . Binding studies consisted of the injection ( association 180 s , dissociation 180 s ) of various concentrations of inhibitor ( 120 n m – 75 m m for compounds 2 , 3 , and 7b , or 3 m m – 1 . 8 m m for 1 ) in the single cycle mode . Binding was measured as resonance units over time after blank subtraction , and data were then evalu - ated by using the Biacore X100 evaluation software ( version 2 . 0 ) . Biomolecular NMR spectroscopy For NMR experiments , 15 N - LecB ( 500 m m ) in TBS / Ca was supple - mented with 5 % D 2 O ( Eurisotop , Germany ) . NMR spectra were measured in standard NMR tubes ( 5 mm ) in the presence and ab - sence of ligand ( 250 or 500 m m ) at 300 K . NMR experiments were performed with a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with an inverse H / C / N - TCI - cryoprobe ( 5 mm ) with active - ly shielded z - gradient . 1 H , 15 N - TROSY - HSQC spectra were acquired with 256 increments in the indirect dimension with 16 scans per in - crement . All NMR spectra were processed and analyzed with Bruk - er’s TopSpin software ( version 3 . 0 ) . Circular dichroism ( CD ) spectroscopy Protein samples for CD measurements and melting assays were pu - rified as described above . CD spectra were measured on a JASCO - J1500 spectropolarimeter ( Gross - Umstadt , Germany ) equipped with a PTC - 510 Peltier Thermostatted Single Cell Holder using a 1 mm optical path . Protein samples were prepared as a 34 . 8 m m solution in TBS buffer supplemented with 1 m m CaCl 2 in a reaction volume of 300 m L with or without 100 m m compound 3 . Scans were per - formed at 37 8 C over a wavelength range of 200 – 280 nm ( three ac - cumulations ) with a scanning speed of 100 nmmin ¢ 1 , 1 nm data pitch , and 1 nm bandwidth . For thermal denaturation , samples were prepared as described above . Folded samples were heated from 37 8 C to 96 8 C with a heating rate of 2 8 C min ¢ 1 . The CD signal at 229 nm was recorded every 1 8 C . Crystallization and structure determination Crystals of recombinant LecB from P . aeruginosa were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using 2 m L of drops con - taining a 50 : 50 ( v / v ) mix of protein and reservoir solution at 19 8 C . The protein at 10 mgmL ¢ 1 was incubated with 15 . 3 m m of 3 in H 2 O and 100 m m CaCl 2 during 1 h at rt prior to co - crystallization . Clusters were obtained in a solution containing 25 % PEG6K , 1 m LiCl , and 0 . 1 m citric acid at pH 3 . 8 . A broken tip was directly mounted in a cryoloop and flash - frozen in liquid nitrogen . Diffrac - tion data were collected at 100 K at the European Synchrotron Ra - diation Facility ( Grenoble , France ) on beamline BM30 A using a MARCCD detector . The data were processed using XDS . [ 39 ] All fur - ther computing was performed using the CCP4 suite . [ 40 ] Data quali - ty statistics are summarized in Table 3 . The structure was solved by molecular replacement using PHASER and the tetramer coordinates of 3ZDV as search model . [ 25 , 41 ] Five percent of the observations were set aside for cross - validation analysis , and hydrogen atoms were added in their riding positions and used for geometry and structure - factor calculations . The structure was refined using re - strained maximum likelihood refinement in REFMAC 5 . 8 [ 42 ] iterated with manual rebuilding in Coot . [ 43 ] Incorporation of the ligand was performed after inspection of the 2Fo - DFc weighted maps . Water molecules , introduced automatically using Coot , were inspected manually . The stereochemical quality of the models was assessed with the program Molprobity , [ 44 ] and coordinates were deposited in the Protein Data Bank under code 5A3O . Aggregation assay A stock solution of LecB ( 40 m L , 200 m m in TBS / Ca ) was mixed with serial dilutions of testing compounds ( 20 m L of final test concentra - tions of 1 . 7 m m to 13 . 5 m m ) into a transparent F - bottom 384 - well microtiter plate ( Greiner Bio - One , Germany , cat . no . 781901 ) in du - plicates . The highest concentration of each inhibitor was included without LecB in duplicates as control . Absorbance was measured on a PheraStar FS ( BMG Labtech , Germany ) plate reader at 600 nm after 30 min and 4 h of incubation at rt and did not show differen - ces between the two time points . The data were analyzed using BMG Labtech MARS software and GraphPad Prism .
