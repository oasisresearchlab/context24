Introduction Technological change plays a crucial role in economic growth and development . In the evolutionary process of technology in various industries , a dominant design invariably emerges to define a new product standard , which thereby brings to an end any period of upheaval initiated by technological discontinuities , thus giving rise to an era of incremental change [ A BERNATHY & U TTERBACK , 1978 ; A NDERSON & T USHMAN , 1990 ] . The prior studies in this field have suggested that during the formulation of a dominant design , a window of learning also emerges resulting in those firms whose innovations conform to the dominant design having a higher probability of survival [ C HRISTENSEN & AL . , 1998 ; T EGARDEN & AL . , 1999 ] . It would appear that in order to catch up with forerunners , technology followers build on their own absorptive capacity by exploiting a few technologies in which they had previously specialized [ C OHEN & L EVINTHAL , 1990 ] . ; Published online January 31 , 2009 563 – 591 Scientometrics 79 ( 2009 ) 564 J ANG & AL . : How do latecomers catch up with forerunners ? Although innovating firms will invariably wish to protect their technology from appropriation by rivals , knowledge diffusion can occur through numerous channels and mechanisms ; thus , the patent system provides appropriate incentives for inventors in the knowledge generation , and helps to solve many of the problems associated with knowledge spillovers , in exchange for temporary monopoly rights . A patent document contains a list of citations , most of which are prior patent citations representing a direct flow , or indirect linkage , of knowledge from the prior art embedded in other patents . Using patent citations as explicit measures , a number of the prior studies have analyzed knowledge spillovers across regions or borders and found the existence of a geographical localization effect [ J AFFE & AL . , 1993 ; J AFFE & T RAJTENBERG , 1999 ; A LMEIDA & K OGUT , 1999 ] . However , with the exception of only a handful of studies [ H U & J AFFE , 2003 ; J ANG & C HANG , 2005 ] , there appears to have been no concerted effort at investigating the pattern of knowledge spillover between technology latecomers and their forerunners through the use of patent citations . This study therefore sets out to explore the patterns of technological change and knowledge spillover in the field of flat panel display ( FPD ) technology , along with the catching - up behavior of latecomers , through the analysis of US patents and patent citations between 1976 and 2005 . In contrast to the bulky cathode ray tubes ( CRT ) used in conventional TVs and monitors , as a modern , indispensable means of display , the extremely thin and lightweight features of flat panel displays ( FPDs ) – for use in information and communication technology ( ICT ) and consumer electronics products , such as laptop PCs , desktop PC monitors , mobile phones , flat and digital TVs – provide one of the most fascinating innovations of the Y2K era . Although there have been several studies on FPD - related industries from diverse perspectives and areas of interest , such as S PENCER [ 2003 A , 2003 B ] on network structure effect and S TOLPE [ 2002 ] on public policy – both of which focused primarily on the citation analysis of academic publications – it is clear that substantial changes have taken place since their respective empirical datasets were compiled in 1989 and 1995 . At the same time , the catching - up behavior of latecomers to technology has been analyzed in various other studies , such as L EE & L IM [ 2001 ] on South Korean industries from 1986 to 1993 , M U & L EE [ 2005 ] on the telecommunications equipment industry in China between 1976 and 1995 , and H U & J AFFE [ 2003 ] and P ARK & L EE [ 2006 ] , both of which examined South Korean and Taiwanese industries up to 1999 . However , it would seem that the patterns of technological change and knowledge spillover , as well as the catching - up behavior of latecomers along the evolutionary chain , have yet to be examined in a distinct field such as FPD technology . This study therefore aims to fill the existing void within these two areas of research and to shed some light on the nature of latecomer’s technological catching - up behavior . Scientometrics 79 ( 2009 ) 565 J ANG & AL . : How do latecomers catch up with forerunners ? In order to track the patterns of knowledge spillover , we divided the evolutionary process of FPD technology into three empirically distinct stages : ( i ) the ‘pre - dominant design’ stage ( 1976 – 1986 ) ; ( ii ) the ‘transition’ stage ( 19871996 ) , which saw the establishment of the dominant design ; and ( iii ) the ‘post - dominant design’ stage ( 1997 – 2005 ) , with several findings arising from the subsequent analysis . Firstly , the catching - up by FPD technology latecomers in South Korea and Taiwan began during the transition stage , a time which saw the establishment of the dominant design ( 1987 – 1996 ) , within the area of semiconductor devices ( IPC class H01L ) with high ‘revealed technology advantage’ ( RTA ) . Secondly , there was no discernible localization of FPD technology spillover within and between South Korea and Taiwan during the transition ( 1987 – 1996 ) and post - dominance design ( 1997 – 2005 ) stages ; instead , high citation frequencies of existing US and Japanese patents were found in South Korean and Taiwanese FPD patents , representing a unilateral flow of knowledge from forerunners to latecomers . Thirdly , a few extraordinary peaks in the citation frequencies of US and Japanese patents with long citation lags were found in South Korean and Taiwanese FPD patents during the transition stage ( 1987 – 1996 ) , indicative of the knowledge threshold that latecomers need to cross in order to catch up with forerunners . Literature review Technological change and the dominant design Whilst technology may be defined as knowledge relating to the use of tools and crafts for solving practical problems , in contrast to the scientific search for answers to intellectual puzzles , technological change is better understood as a dynamic process of search and selection comprising of three interrelated stages , invention , innovation and diffusion [ S CHUMPETER , 1934 ] . In this Schumpeterian trilogy , ‘invention’ refers to the generation of new ideas , ‘innovation’ encompasses the development of these new ideas into commercialized applications , and ‘diffusion’ represents the process of spreading these applications across markets . It would , however , be wrong to consider this trilogy as a linear process , since overlapping and extensive feedback does exist within the three stages . Substantive uncertainties are involved in predicting market demand ( and indeed , innovative progress itself ) in the development and accumulation of technological knowledge . In other words , not only is the technological knowledge which is embedded in an invention or innovation retained or diffused at different rates and in different directions , but it can also be transformed during the evolutionary process as a result of the creation of other inventions or innovations . Scientometrics 79 ( 2009 ) 566 J ANG & AL . : How do latecomers catch up with forerunners ? A BERNATHY & U TTERBACK [ 1978 ] described the pattern of technological innovation as a transition between major breakthroughs and incremental changes , within which the dominant product design represents a milestone of change . A dominant design in product architecture or process technology defines a new industry standard which brings to an end any period of upheaval , introducing economies of scale and thereby presenting subtle challenges to the established firms or new entrants , with significant competitive implications . The growth of the market usually peaks once the dominant design has emerged , indicative of the increasing returns taking place on either the demand or supply side . As a result , the associated knowledge base of technological changes , with regard to the enhancement or destruction of firms’ competences , contributes to a period - by - period shaping and reshaping of different landscapes along the evolutionary chain . Although incumbents will tend to pioneer each class of dominant design and technological discontinuity , the competence - destroying product innovations are usually brought about by new entrants [ A NDERSON & T USHMAN , 1990 ] . C HRISTENSEN & AL . [ 1998 ] also suggested that around the formulation of a dominant design , a window of learning also emerges , resulting in those firms whose innovations conform to the dominant design – irrespective of whether they are proactive or reactive – having a higher probability of survival [ T EGARDEN & AL . , 1999 ] . In other words , opportunities exist for latecomers to enter , or for competing forerunners to switch to , and catch up with , the dominant design by continuing their endeavors in major process innovations or incremental changes . Whilst organizational learning has been viewed as routine - based , target - oriented and history - dependent , the absorptive capacity of a firm , built on its prior knowledge , is crucial to the recognition , assimilation and application of new and external information in the firm’s innovative activities [ C OHEN & L EVINTHAL , 1990 ] . It seems , therefore , that the greater the extent to which a firm’s knowledge overlaps with that embedded in the dominant design , the more effective the firm’s innovations will be . Knowledge spillover and patent citations Although innovating firms will invariably wish to protect their technologies from appropriation by rivals , knowledge diffusion can occur through numerous channels and mechanisms , including voluntary exchanges , such as publications , public presentations , licensing agreements or collaboration , and unintended leakages , such as recruiting , or trading in intermediate goods [ M ANSFIELD , 1985 ] . It is essentially the non - rival and partially non - excludable nature of knowledge which gives rise to the possibility of knowledge spillovers . The patent system therefore provides appropriate incentives for inventors involved in knowledge generation , and helps to solve many of the problems associated with knowledge spillovers , in exchange for temporary monopoly rights . Scientometrics 79 ( 2009 ) 567 J ANG & AL . : How do latecomers catch up with forerunners ? Patent citations are widely accepted as representing either the direct spillover or the indirect linkage of knowledge , as well as their relative importance . Citations appearing in patents ( backward citations ) are used to distinguish the technology embodied within the patent as being novel , useful and non - trivial , relative to the prior art [ J AFFE & AL . , 2000 ] , whilst the number of citations that a patent receives ( forward citations ) can be used as a proxy for its relative value [ H ALL & AL . , 2005 ] . Notwithstanding the drawbacks in using patents and citations as measures of the linkage or spillover of knowledge , they are , nevertheless , the only systematically documented figures on new knowledge , and may be valid with careful interpretation . 1 Knowledge spillover has been empirically found to be localized within countries and regions ; however , the localization effects are also likely to vary , by region or industry , and to fade over time [ J AFFE & AL . , 1993 ; J AFFE & T RAJTENBERG , 1999 ; A LMEIDA & K OGUT , 1999 ; H ENDERSON & AL . , 2005 ] . Furthermore , it has been argued that technological firms which share knowledge with other firms may have higher innovative performance than those which do not , especially if they are sharing with their global counterparts [ S PENCER , 2003 B ] . Those which were formerly large firms , or which engaged in high levels of R & D investment during their early stage of knowledge development , are more likely to position themselves as boundary spanners of the knowledge networks , with the regional actors tapping into their global counterparts for external learning [ S PENCER , 2003 A ] . S TOLPE [ 2002 ] found that the basic nature and sub - class equality of patent citations had significant influences on the citation choice of patents , whereas prior cooperation and inventors’ inter - firm mobility helped to explain the localization of knowledge spillovers . Since the integration of the global economy promotes interaction between countries , regions and organizations , thereby enabling knowledge to flow more readily across boundaries , latecomers may take advantage of international knowledge diffusion from the advanced forerunners to move up the technology ladder [ H U & J AFFE , 2003 ] . However , explicit modeling , through the agglomeration of a variety of technologies , may not effectively reveal the heterogeneous patterns of knowledge spillover in various technological regimes [ W INTER , 1984 ; B RESCHI & AL . , 2000 ] . 1 Firstly , patents merely measure codified knowledge , and indeed , technology is just one form of knowledge with particular emphasis on the use of tools or crafts . Secondly , not all technological inventions or innovations will be patented since there may be some lack of legitimacy or willingness on the part of the inventor of , say , chemical formulae or computer algorithms , in exchange for the granting of temporary monopoly rights . Thirdly , citations with time lags of one to two years are more likely to be submitted by examiners , with only a third to a half of all citations being made by the inventors themselves [ J AFFE & AL . , 2000 ] . Fourthly , it is implicitly assumed that there is knowledge spillover in conjunction with the occurrence of citations [ J AFFE & AL . , 1993 ] . Finally , the comparison of different technologies depends on the evolving patent classification system , by which any further application to other ends , such as industry , comes with risk . Further discussion of the use of patents and citations can be found in similar empirical works by P ATEL & P AVITT , [ 1997 ] , J AFFE & AL . , [ 2000 ] and W ARTBURG & AL . , [ 2005 ] . Scientometrics 79 ( 2009 ) 568 J ANG & AL . : How do latecomers catch up with forerunners ? Catching - up hypotheses As noted above , technological discontinuity can destroy or enhance a firm’s existing competencies [ A NDERSON & T USHMAN , 1990 ] , and although a firm may devote all of its resources to its own innovative efforts so as to strive to achieve the dominant design , some may deliberately avoid being locked - in to a particular approach [ C HRISTENSEN & AL . , 1998 ; T EGARDEN & AL . , 1999 ] . Furthermore , technologically inferior latecomers will invariably suffer from high investment risk and will usually prefer to wait and learn from forerunners following the formulation of the dominant design . By positioning themselves as technology followers in a few select areas in which they have prior experience and specialization , latecomers can build , and rely upon , their own absorptive capacities with higher probabilities [ C OHEN & L EVINTHAL , 1990 ] . Therefore , the emergence of a dominant design typically stimulates a high rate of knowledge deepening , as a direct result of the reduction in the level of uncertainty . We therefore develop our first hypothesis , as follows : Hypothesis 1 : The field in which a technology latecomer enters as the starting point of its catching - up is likely to be associated with its own prior specialization . Meanwhile , knowledge spillover has a tendency to be localized , particularly for knowledge which is tacit in nature . The inter - firm mobility of scientists and engineers , and the proximity of technology or culture , facilitate the localization of knowledge spillovers [ A LMEIDA & K OGUT , 1999 ] . However , through the specialized collaboration of forerunners , such as licensing agreements , contractual production or collaborative partnerships , latecomers can more readily receive knowledge spillovers from forerunners across regions [ R OSENKOPF & A LMEIDA , 2003 ] . Needless to say , publications or patents in a codified knowledge form are much more likely to facilitate diffusion . More specifically , latecomers aiming to catch up may learn more , unilaterally , from foreign forerunners on their purpose at the early stage of learning by imitation or circumventing the innovation spillover from forerunners , than bilaterally , from their local counterparts , until the time when the local stock of knowledge is established . Thus , although the prior literature has found that knowledge spillovers are geographically localized in advanced economies , our second hypothesis , on local latecomers , is developed as follows : Hypothesis 2 : At the time of their entry into new technological fields , the knowledge linkages amongst local latecomers are likely to be weaker than the unilateral flow of knowledge , particularly codified knowledge , coming from forerunners in a global network . Whilst it is common for knowledge to become obsolete with age , knowledge is , nevertheless , diffused over time . Under a combination of these two effects , there will be an initial rise in the probability of useful knowledge flow , followed by a gradual fall with the passage of time [ J AFFE & T RAJTENBERG , 1999 ] . The key stages for a latecomer Scientometrics 79 ( 2009 ) 569 J ANG & AL . : How do latecomers catch up with forerunners ? entering the field of innovation however involve gaining a deep understanding of the basics and characteristics of the technology [ S TOLPE , 2002 ] , and developing close connections with the boundary spanners of the knowledge network [ S PENCER 2003 A ] . Latecomers surely may pursue the acceleration of their learning processes not only by replicating forerunners’ products or processes , but also by investing in R & D to overcome the entry barrier thresholds imposed upon them by the new knowledge . The technological foundations built by the forerunners are invariably indispensable for latecomers , in terms of external learning through publicly available knowledge . We therefore develop our final hypothesis , as follows : Hypothesis 3 : Although the knowledge diffusion from forerunners peaks at a certain time lag and then decays , the rate of adoption of certain forms of old , but good , knowledge , which latecomers need to acquire for the purpose of catching - up in their entry into a new technological domain , should remain high . Data and methodology The three - stage evolutionary process of FPD technology A variety of approaches have been taken to the development of display products and processes by FPD technologies since the 1960s , all of which have benefited greatly from advances in physical and chemical sciences ( see Appendix Table A – 1 ) . 2 , 3 However , prior to 1987 , there were no significant differences in the number of patents granted to various FPD technologies . Strong demand subsequently began to emerge , from around the early - 1990s , for an effective means of displaying high - resolution color content in lightweight form . As a result , thin - film transistor liquid crystal display ( TFT - LCD ) soon came to be recognized as the most superior technology , in terms of its capability to fulfill this demand , as opposed to the twisted nematic / super twisted nematic ( TN / STN ) LCD technology which had previously been adopted for electric watches and calculators ; this thereby established the dominance of TFT - LCD . In 1987 , the number of FPD patents granted to Japanese inventors surpassed those granted to US inventors for the first time , and thereafter continued to grow in all subsequent years ; Taiwanese inventors also received their first FPD patent in 1987 , whilst the first FPD patent in South Korea came one year later , in 1988 . 2 For example , RCA in the US developed liquid crystal display ( LCD ) for use in the cockpit instrument panel of fighter aircraft in 1968 , whilst in 1973 , Sharp successfully applied LCD technology in Japan to introduce the world’s first electronic pocket calculators . 3 A color TFT - LCD unit comprises of a sandwich - type panel of a color filter and a TFT substrate filled in between with liquid crystal , a backlight unit , driving and processing circuits and a metal chassis . In contrast , light emitting diode or electroluminescent ( LED / EL ) display panels or plasma display panels ( PDP ) are more likely to contain an array combination of tiny fluorescent lighting cells , which ultimately proved to be a problematic issue in the competition for their use in portable computers . Scientometrics 79 ( 2009 ) 570 J ANG & AL . : How do latecomers catch up with forerunners ? South Korean manufacturers subsequently announced their investment , for the first time , in the mass production of TFT - LCD manufacturing technology in 1995 , in parallel with Japanese companies . This then ignited the price war in the exportation of TFT - LCD technology , with South Korea gaining greater market share as a result of the Japanese contraction in 1997 brought about by the Asian financial crisis , a time during which Japanese firms adopted a fairly conservative position . At the same time , Taiwanese firms began collaborating with Japanese partners to build TFT - LCD technology and production facilities , taking advantage of the stable and abundant supply of financing . Most TFT - LCD manufacturing is now clustered in Asia , particularly in Japan , South Korea and Taiwan , with the top four TFT - LCD manufacturers , Samsung and LG Philips LCD ( LPL ) in South Korea , and AU Optronics ( AUO ) and Chi - Mei Optronics ( CMO ) in Taiwan , having taken over two thirds of the global market since 2003 . Clearly , therefore , the South Korean and Taiwanese latecomers in FPD technology have already caught up with their Japanese and US forerunners . We therefore divide the evolutionary process of FPD technologies into three distinct periods , taking 1987 and 1997 as the two empirical cut - off points , as follows : ( i ) the ‘pre - dominant design’ stage ( prior to 1986 ) , ( ii ) the ‘transition’ stage ( 1987 – 1996 ) , which saw the establishment of the dominant design , and ( iii ) the ‘post - dominant design’ stage ( since 1997 ) . 4 Data construction The continuous availability of detailed information on patents is achieved through a uniform process involving the systematic compilation of all data , applied by the patent examiner , which provides an appropriate benchmarking reference for the examination of technologies or industries in motion . A patent document provided by the USPTO contains a list of citations , most of which are patent citations , which represent a direct flow or indirect linkage of knowledge , and the importance of the knowledge stemming from the prior art which is embedded in other patents . The ‘proximate’ function or the ‘function - oriented’ principle , which aims to provide an effective search tool , is used as the basis of all USPTO and Worldwide Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) classifications . 5 However , due to the complexity of FPD 4 There is of course an inherent element of arbitrariness in dividing the whole evolutionary process into stages ; however , for the purpose of analyzing the patterns of evolutionary knowledge linkage amongst technology latecomers and forerunners , under the influence of technological changes , these three empirically distinct stages constitute a sort of validation deduced from the product market to examine the way in which latecomers’ catching up is carried out . 5 For example , the US Patent Classification ( USPC ) system has more than 450 three - digit patent classes , whereas the International Patent Classification ( IPC ) divides technology into eight sections , with the four - digit level sub - classes having expanded to more than 600 in 2006 [ USPTO , 2005 A ; USPTO , 2006 ; WIPO , 2006 ] . Scientometrics 79 ( 2009 ) 571 J ANG & AL . : How do latecomers catch up with forerunners ? technology development , it is unlikely that an FPD patent would involve only a single innovative device or process ; instead , a patent typically comprises of a variety of incremental improvements and innovative components which belong to multiple patent classes . Since all patent abstracts provide a description of the invention , including its main contribution and various applications , the keyword search method is adopted in this study to collect details on all patents relating to FPD technologies . This methodology for selecting relevant patents for the analysis of innovative activities has gradually gained greater attention in the recent literature [ C ORROCHER & AL . , 2007 ] ; therefore , a number of keywords are identified as capturing the major FPD technological areas according to industrial reports and various experts . 6 Our search was conducted by cross - referencing these keywords with those appearing in the abstracts of patents granted by the USPTO . As compared to the prior study of S TOLPE [ 2002 ] , which focused on the single USPC class 349 , ‘liquid crystal cells , elements and systems’ , this study investigates more than 300 three - digit level USPC classes to find seven primary USPC classes with partial concordance to the five four - digit level primary IPC classes identified in this study as those most frequently relating to FPD technologies ( see Appendix Tables A – 1 and A – 2 ) . This procedure resulted in a base sample of 15 , 236 FPD patent documents issued between 1976 ( the time of the inception of the computerized patent database with the first FPD patent granted under our keyword search methodology ) , and 2005 ( the last complete year of data collection available at the time that this study was conducted ) . We then compiled another sample of patents cited by the 15 , 236 originating FPD patent sample to obtain 124 , 772 patent citation records , with all self - citations by the same assignees being excluded from the sample . It should be noted that the pool of patent citations , dating back to 1963 , was collected through backward citation links made by the FPD patents , following the same practice adopted in the prior studies [ H ALL & AL . , 2001 ] . These cited patents were considered to be the ‘technological antecedents’ in our spillover and learning framework . Since our primary was to analyze the catching - up behavior and linkage of knowledge between forerunners and latecomers , the patent and citation subsets of South Korea and Taiwan were further separated from those of the US and Japan . 6 The identification of keywords is based upon the Industrial Technology Intelligence Services ( ITIS ) reports carried out and published in Taiwan by the Photonics Industry and Technology Development Association ( PIDA ) and Opto - Electronics and Systems Laboratories ( OESL ) of the Industrial Technology Research Institute ( ITRI ) . Furthermore , one of the authors of this study has been involved in FPD - related fields for a decade . Scientometrics 79 ( 2009 ) 572 J ANG & AL . : How do latecomers catch up with forerunners ? Methodology This study uses three indicators to investigate the patterns of international knowledge linkage and the catching - up behavior of latecomers to FPD technology , as follows . Revealed technological advantage ( RTA ) According to S OETE [ 1987 ] , the ‘revealed technological advantage’ ( RTA ) index of a region in a particular technological class is provided by the region’s share of global patenting in that class , divided by its share of global patenting in all technological classes . The RTA index is therefore defined as follows : RTA ij = ( X ij / (cid:520) i X ij ) / ( (cid:520) j X ij / (cid:520) i (cid:520) j X ij ) , ( 1 ) where X ij is the number of patents for region i in technological class j . Since RTA varies around unity , an index greater than 1 would suggest a comparative technological advantage , whereas an index of less than 1 would indicate a comparative disadvantage for that region in that particular technological class . 7 Citation frequency ( CF ) The citation frequency ( CF ) of patents , i . e . , the frequency they are cited by other patents , is empirically given as a function of the time lag between the grant years of the citing and cited patents [ J AFFE & T RAJTENBERG , 1999 ] . The CF index is calculated as the total number of patent citations , divided by the product of the number of potentially citing , and the number of potentially cited , patents in their cohort grant years . 8 Hence , the CF index is defined as follows : CF = ( C Tt Ll / ( M T L * N t l ) ; T (cid:149) t ( 2a ) where C Tt Ll is the number of patent citations referring to the patents granted to assignees of region l in year t , made by the citing patents granted to assignees of region L in year T ; M T L is the total number of patents of region L in year T ; and N t l is the total number of patents of region l in year t . The average of all citation frequencies at a given time lag is used as an estimate of the probability of the combined effects of diffusion and obsolescence of knowledge . Hence , the CF r index with a time lag r is defined as : CF r = Ave [ ( C Tt Ll / ( M T L * N t l ) ] ; r = T – t , T (cid:149) t ( 2b ) 7 It should be noted that there are some limitations in using the RTA index ; for example , when a region’s patenting is highly concentrated in only a few technological classes , the RTA index , which is thereby raised to an unreasonably high value , does not really represent its comparative advantage with regard to its counterparts in that class . 8 To facilitate the effective examination of the knowledge flow , when calculating the citation frequency , self - citations are excluded . Scientometrics 79 ( 2009 ) 573 J ANG & AL . : How do latecomers catch up with forerunners ? For example , US assignees took out a total of 61 , 104 patents in 1996 , whilst Taiwanese assignees were granted 282 FPD patents in 2004 . Of all of the US patents granted in 1996 , 16 were cited by Taiwanese FPD patents in 2004 . Thus , the estimated CF index for this combination is 0 . 93 * 10 – 6 ( i . e . 16 / ( 282 * 61 , 104 ) ) . To obtain the CF r index for a citation lag of eight years , the average of all CF s made by citing FPD patents must be calculated from 1976 to 2005 . 9 Relative generality and originality A patent has a wider impact if it is cited by subsequent patents in a wide range of technological classes , in which case the generality level of the cited patent is said to be high . Conversely , if a patent cites previous patents belonging to a narrow set of technological classes , the originality of the citing patent is regarded as being low , since it has less creativity . In this study , we adopt two indicators , ‘relative originality’ and ‘relative generality’ , to measure the quality of patent citations , as follows . Firstly , we adopt the bias - adjusted measures for generality and originality at the absolute level , as suggested by H ALL & AL . [ 2001 ] , which we define as : G i = a * [ 1 – (cid:520) j ( F ij / F i ) 2 ] , ( 3a ) and O i = b * [ 1 – (cid:520) j ( B ij / B i ) 2 ] , ( 3b ) where F i denotes the total number of forward citations received by patent i in all technological classes , and F ij is the number of forward citations received by patent i from technological class j only ; B i and B ij are the numbers of corresponding citations made by patent i , i . e . backward citations ; and a and b are the factors adjusting for any downward bias stemming from small F i and B i . Secondly , we further normalize the absolute level of originality ( generality ) of each patent by the average originality ( generality ) of the cohort patents granted in the same year , t , and the same technology class , j . By adopting this normalized measure of generality and originality , the heterogeneity of the offset belonging to different technology classes can be eliminated for direct comparison . Thus , after normalization , the relative originality and generality are derived as : g i = G i / Ave ( G i ) , ( 3c ) and o i = O i / Ave ( O i ) . ( 3d ) 9 Note that all observations on long - lag citations will always be subject to truncation bias . Scientometrics 79 ( 2009 ) 574 J ANG & AL . : How do latecomers catch up with forerunners ? Results and discussion FPD patenting evolution – 1976 – 2005 Our analysis in this study of all related US patents and patent citations was carried out to determine the overall evolution of FPD technologies and to track the way in which popularized FPD technology migrated from forerunners to latecomers between 1976 and 2005 . As illustrated in Figure 1 , the systems embedded within these FPD patents are quite diversified in a variety of technologies , including TN & STN , TFT - LCD , PDP and LED & OLED . Various competing FPD technologies were found to be of greater or lesser importance to patenting during the first period ( prior to 1987 ) ; whereas TFT - LCD clearly emerged as the dominant design in FPD between 1987 and 1996 . Thereafter , the number of TFT - LCD patents soared throughout the mid - 1990s , with such growth continuing up to the present day . According to Table 1 , at the start of the pre - dominant design stage ( 1976 – 1986 ) – prior to TFT - LCD technology becoming the dominant design – only 127 FPD patents had been granted each year on a global scale , of which slightly more than 50 per cent had been filed by US ; this is clearly indicative of the US , at that time , being the principal technology forerunner in new FPD designs . 10 Figure 1 . Number of FPD patents granted , 1976 – 2005 10 A significant proportion of FPD patents were granted to individuals and public institutes during the ‘pre - dominant design’ stage ( 1976 – 1986 ) .

By the mid - 1970s , however , Sharp and Seiko had succeeded in introducing LCD to replace LED in electronic calculators and digital watches in Japan , and were starting to build mass production facilities ; thus , during the pre - dominant design stage as a whole , Japanese FPD patents went on to account for a 32 per cent share , to become the emerging innovative leader in the field of FPD technology . In contrast , no FPD patents were granted to any of the latecomers from South Korea and Taiwan , whilst the category of ‘others’ in Table 1 , which includes Canada , France , Germany , Netherlands , Switzerland , the United Kingdom ( and other economies ) were occupying a 17 . 2 per cent share of the total number of FPD patents during this initial stage . The transition stage ( 1987 – 1996 ) provided confirmation of the position of TFT - LCD as the dominant design in FPD technology , with the average number of FPD patents granted worldwide having more than doubled during this stage , to 312 patents per year ( Table 1 ) . 11 During this transition stage , although 28 per cent of FPD patents still belonged to the US , the contribution from Japan had grown to 55 per cent , making it the prominent leader in FPD technologies . This is consistent with the observation that US inventors had become more interested in fundamental research , and indeed , had proven to be very good at it , whereas Japanese inventors tended to show greater enthusiasm towards commercialization , in terms of both differentiated products and continuous improvements to the production processes [ N ARIN , 1995 ] . Meanwhile , sporadic petitions for FPD patents were starting to be filed and granted by South Korea ( 4 . 6 per cent ) and Taiwan ( 2 . 1 per cent ) during this transition stage , whilst the share of patents accounted for by the group of ‘others’ fell sharply , from 17 . 2 11 Although some may argue that the growth in the average number of patents granted annually since the mid - 1980s may be partly attributable to the pro - patent shift in the US legal environment , there is no doubt that the relative patenting performance amongst various groups of assignees or technologies still holds . Scientometrics 79 ( 2009 ) 576 J ANG & AL . : How do latecomers catch up with forerunners ? per cent during the pre - dominant design stage , to 9 . 8 per cent in the transition ( 1987 – 1996 ) stage . In terms of their share of patents , the technological gap between the forerunners of the US , Japan and other industrialized economies , and the latecomers of South Korea and Taiwan , was reduced sharply over the transition stage when TFT - LCD emerged as the dominant design in FPD technologies ( Figure 1 ) . As Table 1 shows , in the post - dominant design stage ( 1997 – 2005 ) , the average number of FPD patents being granted annually on a global scale soared to 1 , 191 , a three - fold increase on the previous transition stage , and an almost ten - fold increase on the initial pre - dominant design stage . Japan had clearly retained its place as the technology leader in the post - dominant design stage , holding 50 per cent of all FPD patents , whilst South Korea had achieved parity with the US , taking a 17 . 5 per cent share , followed by a 9 . 5 per cent share for Taiwan , a share which was now greater than the 5 . 7 per cent share of all ‘others’ . 12 As a result , South Korea and Taiwan had successfully caught up with the US and , with the exception of Japan , had surpassed all others in the field of FPD technologies during the post - dominant design stage , in terms of both the absolute amount ( or share ) , and the overall growth rate . 13 Latecomer entries with high revealed technology advantage ( RTA ) To determine whether any particular fields are targeted by technology latecomers , we need to be able to step in at the start of their attempts to catch up with forerunners ; we therefore apply the ‘revealed technology advantage’ ( RTA ) index , a measure of a region’s share of total patents in a specific technology divided by the region’s share of total patents in all technologies during the same period , as defined in Equation ( 1 ) . The RTA index has been widely used in the literature as a means of assessing the comparative strength of particular industries or technologies [ S OETE , 1987 ] , and since the RTA varies around unity , an index greater than 1 would suggest a comparative technological advantage of the region in that particular technological class . 14 12 Our detailed investigation showed that Japanese firms underwent a process of consolidation during the post - dominant design stage ( 1997 – 2005 ) to refocus on the niche markets , such as mobile displays using OLED or LTPS technologies , and extra - large size TFT - LCD for application in TVs , rather than in the highly competitive laptop and desktop PC display market . In addition , there has been widespread use of bilateral licensing agreements amongst global FPD firms , reflecting the different areas of emphasis of their patenting activities in various FPD technologies . 13 Singapore , Hong Kong and Israel are commonly considered as newly industrialized economies ; however , they do not hold a significant amount of FPD patents or a significant share of the FPD product market , such that in this study , they are not really considered as latecomers engaged in catching - up . 14 There are three reasons for adopting the International Patent Classification ( IPC ) in this study as opposed to the US Patent Classification System ( USPC ) . The first is that the parallel listing of IPC and USPC classes in US patent documents provides users with the flexibility to adopt either one for retrieval purposes . Secondly , the IPC is rapidly becoming the uniform international classification for patent documentation , particularly in Scientometrics 79 ( 2009 ) 577 J ANG & AL . : How do latecomers catch up with forerunners ? A patent with claims indicative of novelty , usefulness and non - triviality typically entails a bundle of technological classes . In this study , the top five primary IPC classes assigned to FPD patents account for two thirds of all FPD patents granted since 1987 . 15 As Table 2 shows , these five IPC classes account for considerable shares of all patents , including 31 per cent for ‘light control devices’ ( G02F ) , 15 per cent for ‘semiconductor devices’ ( H01L ) , 14 per cent for ‘signal control circuits’ ( G09G ) , 5 per cent for ‘discharge lamps’ ( H01J ) , and 2 per cent for ‘lighting devices’ ( F21V ) . As compared to the share of global FPD patents for each region in Table 1 , Table 2 indicates that South Korean and Taiwanese latecomers had started to catch up with the forerunners by leveraging their relative strengths in particular specialized areas to other major FPD technological classes over the latter two stages ( 1987 – 1996 and 1997 – 2005 ) . According to Table 2 , the computed RTA indices identify South Korea as initially specializing in FPD technologies of ‘semiconductor devices’ ( H01L ) and ‘discharge lamps’ ( H01J ) , the RTAs of which were greater than unity at the transition stage , before expanding , in the post dominant - design stage , to the ‘light control devices’ ( G02F ) class , in the process of liquid crystal cells , elements and systems ( which is closely related to the established dominant design , TFT - LCD ) . Similarly , Taiwan specialized in ‘semiconductor devices’ ( H01L ) and ‘lighting devices’ ( F21V ) during the transition stage , with RTAs greater than unity , and then expanded to the ‘discharge lamps’ ( H01J ) class in the post - dominant design stage . At the same time , Japan retained its FPD technological advantages in the categories of ‘light control devices’ ( G02F ) and ‘signal control circuits’ ( G09G ) over both of these stages ( 1987 – 1996 and 1997 – 2005 ) . In the meantime , FPD patenting in the US remained diversified in various classes , the RTAs of which were smaller than unity , with the exception of ‘lighting devices’ ( F21V ) . In particular , in contrast to the diversified orientation of patenting within the US , Japan was demonstrating impressive strength in its patenting of all of the top five IPC classes of FPD technologies , the RTAs of which are either close to , or above , unity . Europe , taking advantage of the more recent establishment of its classification system ; whereas FPD technology began its evolutionary path in the 1960s , a little earlier than the introduction of the IPC system , the latter considers the modern advances in science and technology which have occurred since 1970 and is not constrained by mapping alongside existing classes of USPC . The IPC was further reformed in 1999 for electronic uses [ WIPO , 2006 ] . Finally , the results provided by the IPC can be used for comparison with current or future research on patent and citation analysis of newly developed technologies throughout international regions , such as biotechnology and nanotechnology . 15 The share of the top five primary IPC classes was based upon 13 , 655 FPD patents granted between 1987 and 2005 . The 2005 data on IPC patent classes was incomplete when being collected due to the ongoing revision from the 7 th to 8 th edition . A detailed description of the IPC classes and the matched USPC classes for TFT - LCD is provided in Appendix Table A - 2 .

Detailed descriptions of each IPC class are provided in Appendix Table 2 . c * indicates p - value < 0 . 1 ; and * * indicates p - value < 0 . 05 . Our empirical results therefore suggest that during the transition stage ( 1987 – 1996 ) , the period when TFT - LCD technology emerged to become the industry standard , South Korean and Taiwanese latecomers were attempting to catch up with the US and Japanese forerunners by leveraging their prior technological advantages in the field of semiconductors , which , as noted by S AXENIAN & H SU [ 2001 ] , they had enjoyed since the early - 1980s . This is also consistent with the ‘late - industrializing’ model of A MSDEN [ 1989 ] , which argued that , given the absence of pioneering FPD technology , it was imperative for economies such as South Korea and Taiwan to learn from others , and then to focus on lower costs , higher productivity or better quality in their maturing industries , by means of incremental improvements . Our postulation in the first of our catching - up hypotheses , that latecomers would strive to grasp the available opportunities around the emergence of the dominant design ( 1987 – 1996 ) through the ‘window of learning’ , exploiting their absorptive capacity built on prior existing knowledge ( in the semiconductor technology ) , is thus supported by the empirical results presented in Table 2 . Scientometrics 79 ( 2009 ) 579 J ANG & AL . : How do latecomers catch up with forerunners ? Non - localization of knowledge spillover amongst latecomers In order to investigate the patterns of knowledge spillovers within and between latecomers and forerunners , we carry out our analysis of patent citations on the latter two stages examined in this study – the transition stage ( 1987 – 1996 ) , during which the dominant design emerged , and the post - dominant design stage ( 1997 – 2005 ) . Prior to undertaking such analysis , as Table 3 shows , by examining the numbers and regions of patent citations made by FPD patents from each corresponding region , the rate of localized US patent citations – the citing of US patents by US FPD patents – remained at around 61 per cent during the latter two stages ( 1987 – 1996 and 1997 – 2005 ) , whilst those of Japanese FPD patents citing Japanese patents revealed a steady increase , from 56 . 1 per cent to 68 . 3 per cent . This result is in line with many of the prior studies on the geographical localization of knowledge spillovers in advanced economies [ J AFFE & T RAJTENBERG , 1993 ; A LMEIDA & K OGUT , 1999 ] . Knowledge spillovers , particularly those which are tacit in nature , such as the inter - firm mobility of scientists and engineers , and proximity in technology or culture , tend to be localized [ A LMEIDA & K OGUT , 1999 ] ; however , the theory of localization of knowledge spillovers does not hold for latecomers , essentially because most of the patent citations made by latecomers refer to forerunners , and this is particularly the case in the transition stage ( 1987 – 1996 ) . As Table 3 shows , during this stage , 48 . 5 per cent of all patent citations appearing in South Korean FPD patents referred to Japanese patents , with a further 32 . 1 per cent referring to US patents , and only 7 . 2 per cent referring to South Korean patents . A similar result is found for Taiwanese FPD patents and their associated patent citations during the initial transition stage , with 29 . 7 per cent of all patent citations appearing in Taiwanese FPD patents referring to Japanese patents , and 48 . 7 per cent referring to US patents , whereas Taiwan itself accounted for only 6 . 3 per cent of geographically localized citations . Indeed , through specialized collaboration with forerunners , such as licensing agreements , contractual production or collaborative partnerships in related fields , as well as learning from publications , public presentations and patent documents , latecomers can more readily receive knowledge spillovers unilaterally from forerunners across regions [ R OSENKOPF & A LMEIDA , 2003 ] , whereas no bilateral flows of knowledge whatsoever are found between forerunners and latecomers , or amongst latecomers themselves . This non - localization phenomenon found in South Korea and Taiwan persists even in the post - dominant design stage ( 1997 – 2005 ) , although a trend towards localization is discernible . Indeed , as Table 3 shows , there has been a 2 . 5 - fold increase in the share of South Korean FPD patents citing South Korean patents , and a 1 . 5 - fold increase in the share of Taiwanese FPD patents citing Taiwanese patents .

Therefore , the knowledge linkage found through our global analysis of patent citations appearing in FPD patents indicates a high probability that inventions or innovations made by forerunners did spillover to latecomers in the transition stage ( 1987 – 1996 ) , from which latecomers could learn and generate their own innovations in the subsequent , post - dominant design stage ( 1997 – 2005 ) and start to work in parallel with , and more likely as , ‘quasi - forerunners’ . We also find that Japanese patents tended to be cited more than US patents in South Korean FPD patents ; whereas Taiwanese FPD patents tended to cite US patents more than Japanese patents , particularly during the transition stage . A similar result was found in H U & J AFFE [ 2003 ] , who examined South Korean and Taiwanese patents , and their citations , albeit without any in - depth discussion . Referring back to other studies in this field , one of the possible reasons for such a tendency , in Taiwan , is the historically strong connection between the academic and technological communities of Taiwan and the US following the Second World War , which generally facilitated knowledge diffusion [ S AXENIAN & H SU , 2001 ] . In the case of South Korea , its geographical proximity to Japan would also have facilitated the mobility of retired engineers from Japan to South Korea [ A MSDEN , 1989 ] . Scientometrics 79 ( 2009 ) 581 J ANG & AL . : How do latecomers catch up with forerunners ? The skewed pattern of citations retained by Japan during the post - dominant design stage , with both South Korean and Taiwanese FPD patents citing Japanese patents more than those of other regions ( including their own ) clearly indicates that Japan had secured its dominance in FPD technologies . Therefore , with regard to the second of our catching - up hypotheses , given the empirical observations presented in Table 3 , our postulation that with the opening up of a new technological field latecomers would tend to learn more from foreign forerunners than from local sources , appears to be validated . In addition to examining the absolute amount and share of patent citations referring to different regions appearing in the FPD patents of various other regions , it may be useful to further explore the nature of the antecedent knowledge embedded in patent citations , taking into account the influence of citation frequencies at different backward citation time lags . Citation frequency ( CF r ) , defined in Equation ( 2b ) , is given as a function of the time lag of r years between FPD patent grant years and their patent citations , with the average of all citation frequencies at a given time lag of r years being used as an estimate of the probability of the combined effects of diffusion and obsolescence of knowledge [ J AFFE & T RAJTENBERG , 1999 ] . Figures 2a and 2b show the respective citation frequencies ( CF r ) for backward citation time lags for US patent citations appearing in FPD patents from different regions in both the ‘transition’ stage and the ‘post - dominance design’ stage . Similarly , Figures 2c and 2d illustrate the citation frequencies ( CF r ) for Japanese patent citations made by FPD patents from different regions over the same periods . Firstly , the evidence on the localized knowledge spillovers received by US ( Japanese ) FPD patents from US ( Japanese ) patent citations is found to be consistent with the prior studies on advanced economies [ J AFFE & AL . , 1993 ; J AFFE & T RAJTENBERG , 1999 ] . With the notable exceptions of some extraordinary peaks by Taiwanese , or South Korean , FPD patents , which will be investigated further in the next section . As Figures 2a and 2b show , the frequency of US patent citations appearing in US FPD patents shows an initial increase , reaching a peak at a time lag of around 4 – 5 years , before gradually decreasing to approach zero . Meanwhile , as Figures 2c and 2d show , the citation time lag for Japanese patent citations appearing in Japanese FPD patents , at peak citation frequency , is about 2 – 3 years . This provides recognition of Japan’s expertise in continuous process improvements , benchmarking with the most up - to - date production techniques , such that the cycle time for Japanese patent citations is shorter than that for US patent citations [ H IRSCHEY & AL . , 2001 ] . Japanese patents have , however , been extensively cited , not only in Japanese FPD patents , but also in those of other regions , as shown in Figures 2c and 2d . Scientometrics 79 ( 2009 ) 582 J ANG & AL . : How do latecomers catch up with forerunners ? This is particularly highlighted by citations appearing in South Korean FPD patents during the post - dominant design stage . This provides support for our argument on the non - localization of knowledge spillovers where latecomers are engaged in catching up . Figure 2a . US patents cited in FPD patents , 1987 – 1996 Figure 2b . US patents cited in FPD patents , 1997 – 2005 Scientometrics 79 ( 2009 ) 583 J ANG & AL . : How do latecomers catch up with forerunners ? Figure 2c . Japanese patents cited in FPD patents , 1987 – 1996 Figure 2d . Japanese patents cited in FPD patents , 1997 – 2005 Furthermore , Figures 2a and 2c show that during the ‘transition’ stage , Japanese patents were likely to be cited more than US patents in South Korean ( Taiwanese ) FPD patents by a factor of three ( two ) at time lags of up to ten years . Similar results are found in Figures 2b and 2d , with the multiplier factors rising to six ( three ) for South Korean ( Taiwanese ) FPD patents citing Japanese patents over US patents in the ‘post - dominant design’ stage . Scientometrics 79 ( 2009 ) 584 J ANG & AL . : How do latecomers catch up with forerunners ? Knowledge threshold of catching - up : old but good Since the reason for patent citations appearing in other patents is to justify the new patent’s novelty from the prior art , and since there is usually a one - to two - year delay between the application and the patent being granted , given a patent’s legal life of 17 – 20 years , the citation frequency is likely to reach its maximum at a short time lag of two to five years . Close observation of US and Japanese patent citation frequencies ( CF r ) in the FPD patents of different regions during the transition stage ( Figures 2a and 2c ) , reveals several abrupt increases at long backward citation time lags , challenging the conventional wisdom in the literature on the diffusion and ultimate obsolescence of knowledge over time [ J AFFE & T RAJTENBERG , 1999 ] . Rather than being a reference of novelty , which usually involves short time lags , those patents that are cited most frequently at long backward time lags may be of high value to citing patents as benchmarking or learning targets because of the importance on their basic nature , or relevance in the particular technological field . Since a patent has a stronger impact if it is cited by subsequent patents in a wide range of technological classes , or if the citations made by the patent itself belong to a broad set of technological classes , thereby demonstrating its creativity , we conduct further investigation into the quality of patent citations at their peak citation frequencies ( Figures 2a - d ) , calculating their relative generality and relative originality , as defined by Equations 3 ( c ) and 3 ( d ) . Panel A of Table 4 provides the results for the transition stage ( 1987 – 1996 ) , whilst the results for the post - dominant design stage ( 1997 – 2005 ) are presented in Panel B . As shown in Panel A , the peak citation frequencies of US ( Japanese ) patents by South Korean and Taiwanese FPD patents during the transition stage were at long time lags of 9 and 15 years ( 13 and 13 years ) , respectively . Their relative generalities are all larger than unity , mostly with statistical significance , whereas their relative originalities are close unity , but with larger variances . In contrast , Panel B shows that the peak citation frequencies of US ( Japanese ) patents by South Korean and Taiwanese FPD patents during the post - dominance design stage were at short time lags of 2 and 3 years ( 3 and 2 years ) , respectively . Their relative generalities and originalities were generally larger than unity , although they were not statistically significant . This , therefore , provides partial support for the conjecture in the third of our catching - up hypotheses , that latecomers are likely to learn from forerunners through certain ‘old , but good’ knowledge , to overcome the knowledge barriers during their entry into a new technological field .

Within the process of evolution through to the final , post - dominant design stage , latecomers had accumulated and developed their own stock of knowledge , and ultimately , were no longer behaving like technology inferior latecomers , but rather , like ‘quasi - forerunners’ who had succeeded in distinguishing themselves from the recent prior art by demonstrating patenting with novelty . As a result , the extraordinary peaks found in the transition stage at long time lags – when latecomers were engaged in catching - up based upon their learning from the knowledge foundation built by forerunners – had disappeared completely . Since the latecomers had become quasi - forerunners , the diffusion pattern of knowledge spillover , in terms of citation frequency during the post - dominant design stage ( 1997 – 2005 ) , indicates that knowledge does become diffused over time , whilst also becoming obsolete . 16 16 Latecomers may learn from forerunners not exactly from specific high - quality patents , in terms of generality , originality , or simply citation frequency , but roughly from particular individuals or institutions which have gained solid reputations as a result of their innovative output . For example , the top three Japanese assignees whose patents were cited by Korean FPD patents at peak citation frequencies ( CF r ) during the transition stage ( 1987 - 1996 ) were Fujitsu , Hitachi and Sharp , whilst the top three US assignees whose patents were cited by Korean FPD patents during the same period were General Electric , IBM and Texas Instruments . Similarly , the top two Japanese assignees cited by Taiwanese FPD patents over the same period were Matsushita and Hitachi , whilst the top three in the US , again over the same period , were independent individuals , Dialight and NionCarbide .

Conclusions Technological change has long been regarded as a central force in shaping the competitive landscape leading to the evolution and structural transformation of industries . In particular , there are certain managerial implications on entry timing by innovators , fields of origin and resource configurations which have considerable impact on their willingness and ability to generate and capture the returns from innovation when the competition shifts as a result of the emergence of a dominant design . In this study , we have explored the patterns of technological change , knowledge spillover and the catching - up behavior of latecomers in the field of flat panel display ( FPD ) technology through the analysis of US patents and patent citations between 1976 and 2005 . Our analysis was based upon an evolutionary perspective emphasizing the dynamic process of change in which firm behavior is not particularly focused on maximizing , but rather on seeking to improve its competitive position by developing its multi - order capabilities , given certain degrees of path dependency [ N ELSON & W INTER , 1982 ] . It is argued that in the face of technological breakthroughs , technology latecomers will tend to enter a few select technological areas related to the emergence of the dominant design by leveraging their prior specialization and by learning from their forerunners . In particular , we propose that there are thresholds of knowledge that latecomers must cross in order to catch up , based upon certain ‘old , but good’ knowledge developed by the forerunners . However , the theory of the geographical localization of knowledge spillovers does not hold for latecomers , but instead , knowledge flows unilaterally from forerunners to latecomers until the latecomers succeed in catching up . We first identified three empirically distinct periods for the whole evolutionary process of FPD technologies ( TN & STN , TFT - LCD , PDP , LED & EL ) by means of an examination of the development of the major applications of FPD technology : the ‘pre - dominant design’ stage ( 1976 – 1986 ) , the ‘transition’ stage ( 1987 – 1996 ) , during which the dominant product architecture ( TFT - LCD ) and its dominant position was established , and the ‘post - dominance design’ stage ( 1997 – 2005 ) . Technology latecomers were categorized as a group who had not pioneered any FPD technologies , with their efforts to catch up being recognized in terms of their share of global FPD patents and their associated growth . Our results show that : ( i ) the efforts by FPD technology latecomers to catch up began in the transition stage ( 1987 – 1996 ) , where the dominant design ( TFT - LCD ) became established , in those areas with high ‘revealed technology advantage’ ( RTA ) ; ( ii ) no localization of knowledge spillover was found amongst FPD technology latecomers ; instead , they displayed higher citation frequencies of forerunners’ patents in their FPD patents during the transition ( 1987 – 1996 ) and post - dominant design Scientometrics 79 ( 2009 ) 587 J ANG & AL . : How do latecomers catch up with forerunners ? ( 1997 – 2005 ) stages ; and ( iii ) there were a few extraordinary peaks in the citation frequency of forerunners’ patents , at long backward citation lags , appearing in latecomers’ FPD patents , particularly in the transition stage , which is indicative of the knowledge threshold that latecomers must cross in order to catch up with forerunners . Although we have focused in this study on the analysis of patents and citations in order to explore the catching - up behavior of latecomers , our assumption was not that institutional policy ( such as subsidizing R & D or the ‘national innovation system’ ( NIS ) in a wider scope ) was unimportant in promoting such catching - up , but rather that it would be more effective as a result of the deeper understanding of the structural underpinnings in technological change and knowledge linkage over the evolutionary process . Furthermore , a firm’s strategic intent and organizational capabilities will surely influence its direction and its catch up rate , but the accumulated technological knowledge and the technological regimes in which firms are involved will clearly constrain the ways in which such latecomers can catch up with forerunners . Our intended contribution in this study was to fill the void that exists in two strings of the literature , the issue of public policy , or institutional factors of knowledge diffusion in FPD - related industries [ S TOLPE , 2002 ; S PENCER , 2003 A , 2003 B ] , and the focus on the catching - up behavior of latecomers , but not particularly on the evolutionary process nor the FPD technologies involved [ L EE & L IM , 2001 ; H U & J AFFE , 2003 ; M U & L EE , 2005 ; P ARK & L EE , 2006 ] . Therefore , although empirically oriented , we believe that our analysis has shed some light on the nature of technological catching - up , and that it points to a range of theoretical implications in technology management in the presentation of our results and subsequent discussion . Two issues deserve further attention and future study , by the use of patents and their citation analysis . Firstly , along the evolutionary chain of technological change , including invention , innovation and diffusion , the underlying technological regimes and ‘appropriability’ regimes have crucial impacts on the emergence of the dominant design [ W INTER , 1984 ; T EECE , 1986 ] . Therefore , it would be of significant help to be able to examine the external validity of our findings for other emerging technologies , such as biotechnology , nanotechnology or solar energy technology , as well as the internal validity through econometric modeling and testing , to confirm the extent to which our propositions and findings may be applicable . Secondly , since it is not particularly necessary to have a pronounced dominant design for every technology or associated industry , or to have a long - lasting dominant position in the face of rapid technological changes or diversified demand , our future work will continue to investigate the patterns of technological change , knowledge spillovers and the catching - up behavior of latecomers in those fields where the dominant design plays a far less important role .
