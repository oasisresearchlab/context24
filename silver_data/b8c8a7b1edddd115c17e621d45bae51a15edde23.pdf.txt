1 / 7 https : / / jkms . org ABSTRACT Inappropriate authorship and other fraudulent publication strategies are pervasive . Here , I deal with contribution disclosures , authorship disputes versus plagiarism among collaborators , kin co - authorship , gender bias , authorship trade , and fake peer review ( FPR ) . In contrast to underserved authorship and other ubiquitous malpractices , authorship trade and FPR appear to concentrate in some Asian countries that exhibit a mixed academic pattern of rapid growth and poor ethics . It seems that strong pressures to publish coupled with the incessantly growing number of publications entail a lower quality of published science in part attributable to a poor , compromised or even absent ( in predatory journals ) peer review . In this regard , the commitment of Publons to strengthen this fundamental process and ultimately ensure the quality and integrity of the published articles is laudable . Because the many recommendations for adherence to authorship guidelines and rules of honest and transparent research reporting have been rather ineffective , strong deterrents should be established to end manipulated peer review , undeserved authorship , and related fakeries . Keywords : Fake Peer Review ; Inappropriate Authorship ; Authorship Trade ; Retractions ; Publication Ethics INTRODUCTION Among the insidious misbehaviors or questionable research practices , inappropriate authorship is widespread and has been documented in both developed and developing countries . 1 - 3 Actually , this deceitful practice can amount to falsification or fabrication and has even been compared to scientific fraud because it misrepresents the authors ' contributions . 4 , 5 Moreover , Kovacs 3 used Bourdieu ' s sociological framework to analyze the mechanisms underlying inappropriate authorship and concluded that undemocratic authorship decisions illustrated by honorary authorship and an authorship - based academic evaluation are a form of symbolic violence . Despite many recommendations on possible ways to curtail undeserved authorship , 3 , 6 - 8 such a malpractice is still evolving and may partially explain the stunning publication rate of overly prolific authors insofar as they do not fully adhere to international authorship criteria . 9 I comment here on some authorship issues and the novel fakery of fraudulent peer review .

More precisely , the declared contributions are not necessarily real . 9 AUTHORSHIP DISPUTES AND PLAGIARISM AMONG COLLABORATORS In developed countries , the most common allegations of misbehavior result from authorship disputes which are increasing at a similar pace as the number of authors per article . 13 Regardless of whether or not such quarrels reveal that many scientists ignore or disregard the Mertonian values , some of such conflicts are better described as plagiarism among collaborators . 14 - 16 While authorship disputes usually reflect disagreement over attribution and order in the byline , in - house plagiarism deprives someone of receiving proper credit and hence violates the author rights ; “It ' s like stealing one ' s friends or family . ” 14 KIN CO - AUTHORSHIP According to Creamer , 17 whenever academic spouses or intimate partners appear as joint authors , they defend their intellectual autonomy through a clear demarcation of their distinct research fields . In a subsequent survey of nine academic couples , Creamer 18 highlighted the conjoint effort to maintain parallel records so that no member “would be seen as the trailing partner . ” Note that these efforts to preserve the own autonomy contrast with the systematic inclusion of both partners as co - authors even if the respective research fields are different . 19 A parent - child inappropriate co - authorship appears to be emerging and may be not so rare . Such a malpractice is currently under investigation in Korea where some researchers are adding the names of their middle - or high - school children as co - authors . 20 GENDER BIAS Although the proportion of women first authorship has increased in the last decades , men first authors still publish more papers . An analysis of 3 , 758 original articles published in 6 top medical journals during 1994 – 2014 revealed that women first authorship increased significantly from 27 % in 1994 to 37 % in 2014 , a figure greater than the < 30 % of women clinical faculty quoted therein . 21 Likewise , Lerback and Hanson 22 documented that among 7 , 196 distinct first authors who submitted 22 , 067 papers to all 20 journals published by the American Geophysical Union ( AGU ) during the period 2012 – 2015 , just 26 % were women ; moreover , women 1st authors submitted 0 . 79 fewer manuscripts per person than their men 2 / 7 https : / / jkms . org https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3346 / jkms . 2019 . 34 . e6 Fake Peer Review and Inappropriate Authorship counterparts ( although the respective acceptance rates were 61 % and 57 % ) . The proportion of women reviewers ( 20 % ) was substantially less than the proportion ( 28 % ) of women members in both the AGU and science , technology , engineering and mathematics ( STEM ) American community . 22 In a comparable analysis , 23 women accounted for 23 . 2 % , 26 . 0 % and 36 . 8 % of last , corresponding and first authorships in 7 , 192 full submissions to ‘eLife’ between 2012 and 2017 . Gender disparity was also clearly seen in acceptance rates for last authors ( 53 . 4 % for men vs . 49 . 7 % for women ) and was greatest when the reviewers were all men . Among 6 , 669 gatekeepers ( editors and reviewers ) dealing with full submissions , only 1 , 372 ( 20 . 6 % ) were women . 23 These data highlight how the underrepresentation of women in editorial boards and bias of men editors and reviewers could influence women ' s success in publishing . 21 - 23 Regardless of the possible role of inappropriate authorship related to sexism or other biases , the relevance of such disparities is magnified when we consider that a high rate of first author papers is one of the main factors behind academic success . 24 AUTHORSHIP FOR SALE The black market for authorship listings , first documented five years ago in China 25 and then in Iran , 26 is now a widespread practice . In a further sting operation , 27 a fictional author asked 263 out of 400 so - called predatory publishers and 64 biomedical journals of the same kind to add a co - author name to any manuscript they would publish . Among the responsive entities ( 117 publishers and 35 journals ) , 19 / 117 ( 16 . 2 % ) , and 3 / 35 ( 8 . 6 % ) agreed to the request without asking for a specific contribution disclosure . Although the country of origin of the 117 responsive publishers was not identified , 119 ( 29 . 8 % ) and 94 ( 23 . 5 % ) out of 400 publishers that produce 4 , 924 biomedical journals were located in India and the United States , respectively . FAKE PEER REVIEW ( FPR ) Due to their direct monetary value in terms of better salaries and bonuses , publications have spawned the industry of “academic article brokering” and triggered novel ruses such as the FPR scam . 28 Using this sly strategy , some submitting authors suggest fake or sometimes real reviewers but provide the editors with invented e - mail addresses allowing the submitters to receive the invitation to review their own manuscripts . In a further elaboration , a peer circle is sometimes created to internally review the papers of each co - participant . Yet , it is likely that third - party agencies paid by the authors supply most of fabricated reviewers and reviews . 28 - 30 Manipulation of the peer review process accounts for a large proportion of retracted articles , particularly those published in open access journals ( OAJs ) . Although only 621 / 5 , 354 ( 11 . 6 % ) retractions listed in PubMed until October 2017 concerned papers in OAJs , this proportion has been steadily increasing since 2010 and for 2016 it was 24 . 6 % . 31 These authors found that FPR ( alone or combined with other reasons ) accounted for 93 / 621 ( 15 % ) retractions in OAJs but did not provide the respective figure for conventional journals ; yet , a much smaller proportion in the latter can be assumed because FPR was first disclosed in 2012 . 32 Wang et al . 31 also observed that FPR “was the number one reason for retraction in the five journals ( of 93 with multiple tagged articles ) with the highest rate of retractions” and accounted for 3 / 7 https : / / jkms . org https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3346 / jkms . 2019 . 34 . e6 Fake Peer Review and Inappropriate Authorship most retractions in journals with an impact factor < 2 . Taking into account the first author ' s country of residence , Iran with 56 % ( 28 / 50 ) and China with nearly 30 % ( 58 / 199 ) exhibited the highest proportion of retractions related to FPR . Other comparable studies confirm that FPR is rife in countries like China , Iran , Korea , India , and Pakistan . Qi et al . 33 identified 250 retracted articles due to FPR in Retraction Watch until November 2015 . Except for one paper whose country of origin was unknown , all retractions were from China ( 187 ) , Korea ( 28 ) , Iran ( 17 ) , and Pakistan ( 17 ) . By June 2018 , that figure had increased to > 600 retractions with the vast majority concerning manuscripts from Asia while there were > 700 papers retracted by inappropriate authorship or related issues and predominantly with the same continental origin . 34 An analysis of retracted publications by Chinese authors — including 24 repeat offenders with > 5 retractions each — during the period 1997 – 2016 revealed about 12 % ( 100 / 834 ) of retractions due to FPR mostly in low - impact journals . 35 Searching in PubMed and Web of Science in May 2017 , Chen et al . 36 documented that 137 / 825 ( 15 . 5 % ) retracted papers ( 95 original articles and 42 meta - analyses ) from mainland China were invalidated by FPR . Overall , there were 651 ( 78 . 9 % ) retractions from journals with an impact factor < 5 and 72 ( 8 . 7 % ) from journals not listed in the Science Citation Index . A further analysis ranked the top 25 countries with the highest number of retractions during 1996 – 2014 in the Scopus database and found that the countries with the highest normalized ratio of retractions were China ( 755 ) , Iran ( 99 ) , Taiwan ( 77 ) , India ( 20 ) , and Korea ( 20 ) ; with one exception , the respective figure for all other countries was ≤ 7 . 37 A search in KoreaMed ( this database indexes abstracts of all medical journals based in Korea ) from January 1990 to January 2016 disclosed that 114 / 217 , 839 papers were retracted mainly due to duplicate publication and plagiarism ; although FPR was seemingly not a retraction reason , it may had gone unrecognized and been included in the “unknown” ( 20 . 2 % ) and “other” ( 3 . 5 % ) categories . 38 Finally , compromised peer review was the leading cause of retraction of articles published in BioMed Central journals in 2000 – 2015 : though the authors ' country of origin was not specified , FPR accounted for 44 / 134 ( 33 % ) retracted reports . 39 CONCLUDING REMARKS Inappropriate authorship has been considered a kind of prisoner ' s dilemma by Shaw 40 who highlights how researchers , instead of behaving ethically , opt for misattribution of authorship to avoid a disadvantageous position in front of academic rivals . In Bourdieusian terms , the current forms of academic evaluation centered on authorship confer legitimacy to the transformation of administrative power and seniority into undeserved authorship and ultimately into intellectual capital , a clear case of symbolic violence . 3 Regardless of whether men are more likely than women to engage in authorship malpractices and FPR , it seems that , alike to researchers guilty of fraud , extreme perpetrators are mostly men . 41 In contrast to underserved authorship , plagiarism , self - plagiarism , and other ubiquitous malpractices , authorship trade and FPR appear to concentrate in countries with emerging economies or at the “periphery of the scholarly endeavor” such as some Asian nations that exhibit a mixed academic pattern of rapid growth and poor ethics . To counteract FPR , China ' s main research agency announced that it will demand to dozens of guilty Chinese researchers to return research funding . 42 Even harsher disciplinary actions and a “zero tolerance” policy were set up by China ' s government after the mass retraction of 107 papers ( including 101 due to FPR ) in ‘Tumor Biology’ by more than 400 Chinese authors in April 2017 . 43 Altogether , 4 / 7 https : / / jkms . org https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3346 / jkms . 2019 . 34 . e6 Fake Peer Review and Inappropriate Authorship these data agree with the perception that strong pressures to publish coupled with the incessantly growing number of publications entail a lower quality of published science 44 in part attributable to a poor , compromised or even absent ( in predatory journals ) peer review . 45 In this regard , the commitment of Publons ( http : / / home . publons . com ) to strengthen the peer review process and ultimately ensure the quality and integrity of the published articles is laudable . By making a profile of each researcher and listing his / her achievements as a reviewer , this platform helps editors choose the appropriate referees and avoid the FPR trap . 46 In addition , we must be aware that cash incentives per publication may push unscrupulous researchers to cross the line not only in China , Iran and other countries with a rapid scientific growth 9 , 31 , 37 but also in low - output nations like Mexico where fake authorship prevails and publications are equally rewarded with money . Because the many recommendations for adherence to authorship guidelines and rules of honest and transparent research reporting 8 have been rather ineffective , alternative academic assessments ( either unfocused on authorship or based on a fractional credit allocation ) and strong deterrents should be established to end up with manipulated peer review , inappropriate authorship , and related fakeries .
