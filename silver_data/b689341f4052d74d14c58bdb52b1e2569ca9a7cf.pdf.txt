Abstract : Regulation of cellular actin dynamics is pivotal in driving cell motility . During cancer development , cells migrate to invade and spread ; therefore , dysregulation of actin regulators is often associated with cancer progression . Here we report the role of ABRACL , a human homolog of the Dictyostelium actin regulator Costars , in migration and tumorigenic growth of cancer cells . We found a correlation between ABRACL expression and the migratory ability of cancer cells . Cell staining revealed the colocalization of ABRACL and F - actin signals at the leading edge of migrat - ing cells . Analysis of the relative F - / G - actin contents in cells lacking or overexpressing ABRACL suggested that ABRACL promotes cellular actin distribution to the polymerized fraction . Physi - cal interaction between ABRACL and coﬁlin was supported by immunoﬂuorescence staining and proximity ligation . Additionally , ABRACL hindered coﬁlin - simulated pyrene F - actin ﬂuorescence decay in vitro , indicating a functional interplay . Lastly , analysis on a colorectal cancer cohort demon - strated that high ABRACL expression was associated with distant metastasis , and further exploration showed that depletion of ABRACL expression in colon cancer cells resulted in reduced cell prolifer - ation and tumorigenic growth . Together , results suggest that ABRACL modulates actin dynamics through its interaction with coﬁlin and thereby regulates cancer cell migration and participates in cancer pathogenesis . Keywords : actin regulator ; cell migration ; coﬁlin ; colorectal cancer ; tumorigenesis 1 . Introduction Cell migration is a fundamental mechanism of cancer pathogenesis . For example , in the process of metastasis , various environmental cues direct cancer cells to migrate and invade into surrounding tissues or vessels , causing cancer to spread [ 1 – 3 ] . In light of this , therapeutic strategies that target cell migration are potentially effective in curbing cancer progression and improving patient outcomes . To develop these migration - targeting thera - peutics , a thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying cancer cell movements is crucial . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 2037 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / ijms22042037 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / ijms Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 2037 2 of 21 The complexity of cellular events involved in directional cell migration has created challenges toward the full elucidation of the underlying molecular network . The movement of cells in a guided direction requires the coordination of a multitude of cellular machineries to carry out distinct steps : a migrating cell needs to sense the directional cue , transduce the signal into appropriate intracellular activities , establish polarity , and dynamically rearrange the cytoskeletal organization for the generation of motion [ 4 , 5 ] . Much remains to be learned about the molecular linkages between the aforementioned steps and the intricate regulation of the entire cell migration process . To bridge these knowledge gaps , we have previously performed genetic screening for novel regulators of chemotaxis in the simple eukaryotic model system Dictyostelium discoideum and discovered Costars as a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton and cell motil - ity [ 6 ] . This ~ 9 kD protein was designated Costars as it displays signiﬁcant sequence homology to the C - terminal domain of the actin - binding Rho activating protein ( ABRA ) ; ABRA was formerly named the striated muscle activator of Rho signaling ( STARS ) and is a mammalian actin - binding protein that regulates the serum response factor transcriptional activity through the activation of RhoA [ 7 , 8 ] . Dictyostelium cosA - cells without the expres - sion of Costars exhibit severely defective chemotactic responses , showing abnormal actin patterns and migrating at a markedly decreased speed , and the cellular F - / G - actin ratios in cosA - cells are higher than those in wild - type cells [ 6 ] . The human Costars homolog ABRACL can functionally replace Dictyostelium Costars and rescue the phenotypes of cosA - cells [ 6 ] . Structural analysis of ABRACL has indicated that it is a non - typical winged - helix protein , with a positively charged surface on one side , a negatively charged surface on the other side , and a hydrophobic groove , which may allow ABRACL to interact with other proteins [ 9 ] . Despite the revealed structural features , the cellular functions and physiological roles of ABRACL are largely unknown . In this study , we investigated the role of ABRACL in cancer cell migration . Results demonstrated that the level of ABRACL expression was correlated with the migratory capacity of cells . Data also suggested that ABRACL may regulate cellular actin dynamics , possibly through interacting with the actin regulator coﬁlin . Furthermore , analyses revealed the upregulation of ABRACL expression in clinical specimens of cancerous tissues and an association of ABRACL expression with proliferation and tumorigenic growth of colorectal cancer cells . 2 . Results 2 . 1 . ABRACL Expression Affects Cancer Cell Migration Given that ABRACL and Dictyostelium Costars share remarkable sequence similarity and that ABRACL can rescue the migration defect of Costars - deﬁcient Dictyostelium cells [ 6 ] , we set out to test the role of ABRACL in cancer cell migration . We ﬁrst proﬁled ABRACL expression in a panel of human cancer cell lines and found high expressers , such as HCT116 , medium expressers , such as MDA - MB - 231 , and low expressers , such as SW620 ( Figure S1 ) . Based on the proﬁling , we chose to transfect MDA - MBA - 231 cells with an ABRACL - expressing vector and perform knockdown or knockout of ABRACL expression in HCT116 cells . The resulting sets of isogenic cells expressing ABRACL at different levels were assessed for their ability to migrate . We found that MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells with transient overexpression of HA - ABRACL showed increased migration as compared to that of control cells in the Transwell assay ( Figure 1A ) . On the other hand , stable clones of HCT116 colon cancer cells infected with two different ABRACL - targeting shRNA - expressing lentiviruses ( Sh295 and Sh484 ) showed lower ABRACL expression and exhibited signiﬁcantly reduced migration as compared to that of the knockdown control ( shLuc ) cells ( Figure 1B ) . Expressing HA - ABRACL from an RNAi - resistant vector in ABRACL - knockdown cells enhanced migratory ability , conﬁrming that the decrease of migration in these knockdown cells was due to the reduction of ABRACL expression ( Figure 1C ) . We also carried out CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated genomic editing to obtain ABRACL - knockout cells . Two different sequences were used to prepare ABRACL - targeting guide RNA ( gRNA ) - Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 2037 3 of 21 expressing vectors for co - transfection with a Cas9 - expressing vector into HCT116 cells . We identiﬁed candidate knockout clones by Western analysis and veriﬁed the editing at the ABRACL locus in these clones by genomic DNA sequencing . All ﬁve ABRACL - knockout clones examined displayed signiﬁcantly reduced migration in the Transwell assay ( Figure 1D ) . Figure 1 . ABRACL expression affects cancer cell migration .

Sci . 2021 , 22 , 2037 4 of 21 The directional migration of cancer cells is stimulated by various signaling molecules , including chemokines and growth factors [ 3 ] . For example , it has been reported that EGF promotes the migration of MDA - MB - 231 cells [ 10 ] . To investigate if ABRACL is involved in elicited migratory responses of cancer cells , we employed the EGF - stimulated MDA - MB - 231 cell migration assay . CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated ABRACL - knockout MDA - MB - 231 clones were generated ( Figure 2A ) and subjected to in vitro wound closure cell migration assays . In this cell line , depletion of ABRACL expression did not affect the basal migration activity ( Figure 2B ) . However , when cells were stimulated with EGF in the assay , ABRACL - knockout cells exhibited signiﬁcantly decreased migration compared to the parental control cells ( Figure 2C ) . Figure 2 . ABRACL modulates elicited cell migration .

Quantitative data are shown on the right ; the area of the wound region was measured using ImageJ software , and the extent of wound closure relative to that of the parental cells was calculated . Mean ± SD from at least 3 independent experiments are shown ; * , p < 0 . 05 . ( B ) Cells assayed in a standard medium . ( C ) EGF - stimulated wound healing . Cells were incubated in a serum - free medium for 16 h before an in vitro wound was made at time 0 and further incubated in the absence or presence of 10 ng / mL EGF ; images were taken at 0 and 6 h to determine the wound closure efﬁciency . Taken together , the above - mentioned results suggest an important role of ABRACL in modulating cancer cell migration . 2 . 2 . ABRACL Expression Inﬂuences Cell Morphology We noticed that cells expressing different levels of ABRACL displayed different morphology and therefore performed computer - assisted morphology analysis to demon - strate the phenotype . Microscopic images of TRITC - phalloidin - stained cells were cap - tured under a ﬂuorescence microscope and analyzed to determine the cell area . Results showed that compared to the control cells , ABRACL - knockdown and ABRACL - knockout Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 2037 5 of 21 HCT116 cells were more well - spread on the substratum , exhibiting a larger average cell area ( Figure 3A , B ) . We also analyzed the morphology of GFP - and GFP - ABRACL - expressing clones of SW620 cells ( which express low levels of endogenous ABRACL ) and found that GFP - ABRACL - expressing clones displayed a signiﬁcantly smaller average cell area compared to those of the GFP - expressing control clones ( Figure 3C ) .

( D ) Parental and ABRACL - knockout ( G1 - 3 , G2 - 25 ) MDA - MB - 231 cells were serum - starved for 16 h and then treated with 50 ng / mL EGF or not for 30 min before analysis . Western analysis on these cells is also shown ; the increased p - Akt level demonstrates the effect of EGF . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 2037 6 of 21 It is known that EGF can stimulate the spreading of MDA - MB - 231 cells [ 11 ] . We investigated if ABRACL expression affects cell morphology in EGF - stimulated MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Figure 3D ) . In this cell line , there was no obvious effect of ABRACL depletion on the morphology of untreated cells ; the average cell areas of ABRACL - knockout cells and the parental control cells were similar . We treated cells with EGF and checked the effectiveness of treatment using Akt phosphorylation ( p - Akt ) as a read - out of the activation of the EGFR - PI3K - Akt signaling pathway , which underlies EGF - induced migration of MDA - MB - 231 cells [ 12 ] . Results conﬁrmed the pathway - activating effect of EGF in both parental and ABRACL - knockout cells . However , while EGF treatment resulted in parental cells displaying a well - spread morphology on the substratum and an increased average cell area , EGF treatment did not induce cell spreading in ABRACL - knockout clones , and the average cell area stayed similar to that of untreated cells . These results indicated that ABRACL expression affected the EGF - stimulated morphological change . Although the effects of perturbing ABRACL expression on cell morphology varied in different cell lines , results together demonstrate that ABRACL expression can affect cell morphology . 2 . 3 . ABRACL Associates with the Actin Cytoskeleton As the actin cytoskeleton is a major determinant of cell morphology and motility , the aforementioned results are consistent with the notion that ABRACL serves a regulatory function on the actin cytoskeleton in cancer cells as Costars does in Dictyostelium . To explore the role of ABRACL in actin regulation , we investigated whether ABRACL interacts with the actin cytoskeleton . We ﬁrst examined if recombinant ABRACL directly binds to F - actin in vitro . GST - ABRACL puriﬁed from E . coli was processed by Factor Xa protease digestion , and the cleaved - off GST was removed by GST pulldown procedures to obtain the untagged ABRACL protein ( Figure 4A ) . Using the puriﬁed ABRACL in the in vitro F - actin co - sedimentation assay , we found that a small fraction of ABRACL co - sedimented with F - actin ( Figure 4B and Figure S2 ) ; quantitative results from independent experiments showed a signiﬁcant increase of ABRACL signal in the F - actin - containing pellet fraction compared to that in the pellet fraction with no added F - actin ( Figure 4C ) . These results indicated that puriﬁed recombinant ABRACL bound to F - actin , although very weakly , under the in vitro experimental conditions . We next performed cell staining experiments to examine the cellular localization of ABRACL in relation to that of actin . In MDA - MB - 231 cells ﬁxed during the process of in vitro wound closure , ﬂuorescence signals for endogenous ABRACL and F - actin were colocalized at the leading edge of lamellipodia ( Figure 4D ) , suggesting that ABRACL may physically associate with the actin cytoskeleton . 2 . 4 . ABRACL Expression Affects the Equilibrium of Cellular F - and G - actin We next examined if ABRACL exerts any effect on the steady - state F - actin and G - actin equilibrium . Lysates from control and ABRACL - knockdown or ABRACL - knockout HCT116 cells were fractionated to obtain F - actin ( pellet ) , and G - actin ( supernatant ) fractions and the amounts of actin present in each fraction were analyzed . The results showed that both ABRACL - knockdown and ABRACL - knockout cells displayed lower cellular F - / G - actin ratios compared to the control cells ( Figure 5A , B ) . Moreover , when ABRACL - knockout cells were transfected to express GFP - ABRACL , the distribution of cellular actin to the F - actin fraction was increased , resulting in an increased cellular F / G - actin ratio ( Figure 5C ) . These data suggest that ABRACL may modulate actin dynamics in favor of increasing the relative content of F - actin . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 2037 7 of 21 Figure 4 .

Shown are results from at least three independent experiments ; * , p < 0 . 05 . ( A ) Lysates from the control ( ShLuc ) or ABRACL - knockdown ( Sh295 and Sh484 ) HCT116 were analyzed . ( B ) Lysates from parental or ABRACL - knockout ( G2 - 11 and G3 - 9 ) HCT116 clones were analyzed . ( C ) Lysates from parental or ABRACL - knockout HCT116 clone G2 - 11 cells transfected to express GFP or GFP - ABRACL were analyzed . 2 . 5 . ABRACL Interacts with Coﬁlin We next explored how ABRACL may participate in regulating actin dynamics . Pre - viously , we identiﬁed the well - known actin - depolymerizing factor coﬁlin [ 13 , 14 ] as a candidate Costars - interacting protein in Dictyostelium using co - immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis ( H . - C . Liao and M . - Y . Chen , unpublished results ) . Given such , we investigated if ABRACL likewise interacts with coﬁlin and thereby regulates cellular actin dynamics . We ﬁrst examined if ABRACL and coﬁlin can colocalize in cells . When randomly migrating MDA - MB - 231 cells were ﬁxed and subjected to immunoﬂu - orescence staining with ABRACL - and coﬁlin - speciﬁc antibodies , ﬂuorescence images of cells captured by confocal microscopy demonstrated colocalization of ABRACL and coﬁlin signals ; moreover , computer - assisted image analysis showed that the colocalization was particularly evident at lamellipodia ( Figure 6A ) . We further examined the physical interaction of ABRACL and coﬁlin in situ , employing a proximity ligation assay ( PLA ) on cells plated on ﬁbronectin . Fluorescence PLA signals were detected in the control cells but greatly diminished in ABRACL - or coﬁlin - knockdown cells ( Figure 6B ) , suggesting a speciﬁc interaction of ABRACL and coﬁlin in cells . When immunoprecipitation was performed in lysates from cells expressing ABRACL - Myc - His using anti - Myc antibodies , endogenous coﬁlin was detected together with the immunoprecipitated ABRACL - Myc - His ( Figure 6C ) , conﬁrming that ABRACL can associate with coﬁlin in cells . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 2037 9 of 21 Figure 6 . ABRACL interacts with coﬁlin . ( A ) Immunoﬂuorescence staining . MDA - MB - 231 cells were ﬁxed and incubated with both anti - ABRACL and anti - coﬁlin primary antibodies in the procedure . Fluorescence signals were captured under a confocal microscope . Colocalization of ABRACL and coﬁlin signals along the shown lines ( 1 , 2 , 3 , and c ) were quantiﬁed and plotted against the distance from the origin of each line . ( B ) In situ proximity ligation assay ( PLA ) . HCT116 cells infected with luciferase - targeting ( shLuc ) , ABRACL - targeting ( Sh484 ) or coﬁlin - targeting ( shCFL1 - 1 ) shRNA - expressing lentivirus were analyzed . Cells were ﬁxed , incubated with anti - ABRACL and anti - coﬁlin antibodies , and subjected to in situ PLA using the Duolink kit ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Cells were also stained with FITC - phalloidin for F - actin and Hoechst for DNA . Representative ﬂuorescence micrographs and Western analysis conﬁrming the knockdown effects are shown .

ABRACL Inhibits Coﬁlin - Mediated Actin Depolymerization In Vitro To further examine the effects of ABRACL on actin dynamics , we tested puriﬁed re - combinant proteins in in vitro actin assays . When only puriﬁed recombinant ABRACL was added in the actin polymerization reactions , the results showed that ABRACL inhibited actin polymerization in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure 7A ) . When tested in the depoly - merization reactions , ABRACL alone did not affect the kinetics of actin depolymerization even at a concentration as high as 15 µ M in the reaction ( Figure 7B ) . These in vitro results appeared to contradict the above - mentioned ﬁnding of decreased F / G - actin ratios in cells lacking ABRACL ; one possible explanation for this is that in the cellular context , ABRACL may be exerting its actions together with its interacting proteins . Given the physical inter - action between ABRACL and coﬁlin , we investigated their functional interaction . Coﬁlin is an actin - binding protein , which multiplies the number of depolymerizing actin ends by severing activity and enhances the pointed end depolymerization and thereby increases actin ﬁlament disassembly [ 14 , 15 ] . We employed the in vitro actin depolymerization assay to examine if ABRACL affects the activity of coﬁlin . Results showed that adding coﬁlin into preformed pyrene - F - actin accelerated the decay of the ﬂuorescence signal , and the ad - dition of ABRACL in the reaction blunted this effect of coﬁlin in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure 7C ) . Because binding of coﬁlin to F - actin can cause quenching of the ﬂuorescence of pyrene F - actin [ 16 , 17 ] , to rule - out that the above ﬁnding was caused by ABRACL inhibiting the binding of coﬁlin to F - actin , we performed the in vitro F - actin co - sedimentation assay to test the possibility . We found that ABRACL did not inhibit the co - sedimentation of coﬁlin with F - actin ( Figure S3 ) . Taken together , these ﬁndings suggest that ABRACL can functionally interact with coﬁlin in modulating actin dynamics , consistent with the scenario in which ABRACL promotes the distribution of cellular actin to the F - actin fraction by inhibiting coﬁlin - stimulated actin disassembly . 2 . 7 . ABRACL Is Overexpressed in Human Cancerous Tissues , and the Depletion of ABRACL Expression Reduces Cell Proliferation and Tumorigenic Growth As cell migration is deemed pivotal in cancer pathogenesis , and because our ﬁndings suggested that ABRACL may regulate cell motility through modulating actin dynamics , we were prompted to investigate the expression of ABRACL in clinical specimens . Im - munohistochemistry ( IHC ) analysis on human colon cancer tissue sections showed strong ABRACL immunoreactivity in the tumor but not in adjacent non - tumor tissues ( Figure 8A ) . We examined more specimens in tissue microarrays of primary colon cancers for ABRACL expression using IHC , and the staining was scored by pathologists ( Figure 8B ) ; when the data were analyzed in relation to clinical records of patients , results revealed a signiﬁcantly higher rate of high ABRACL expression in cases with distant metastasis ( 41 . 4 % ) than that in cases with no metastasis ( 11 . 1 % ) ( p < 0 . 01 ) ( Table 1 ) . Such ﬁndings were consistent with the notion that ABRACL may contribute to cancer metastasis by enhancing cell motility . Given the high ABRACL protein level in cancer , we asked whether ABRACL is upregulated at the transcript level . Bioinformatics surveys using the available data of RNA sequencing expression proﬁles on clinical samples from the TCGA and GTEx projects in the GEPIA web server ( http : / / gepia . cancer - pku . cn . html , September 2020 ) revealed that ABRACL transcript levels were upregulated , with statistical signiﬁcance , in various types of cancers compared to respective normal tissues ( Figure 8C and Figure S4 ) .

Having noted the differential ABRACL expression in normal and cancerous tissues , we next investigated whether ABRACL expression may also be associated with tumorigen - esis . Stable ABRACL - knockout HCT116 clones were subjected to WST - 1 assays , and the results demonstrated that cell proliferation was inhibited in ABRACL - knockout cells when compared to the control ( Figure 8D ) . The depletion of ABRACL expression in HCT116 cells also caused a decrease in tumorigenic growth and the extent of transformation , as evidenced by results of the in vitro colony formation assays ( Figure 8E ) and anchorage - independent growth assays on the soft agar plates ( Figure 8F ) . Taken together , these data suggest that ABRACL plays an important role in maintaining the tumorigenic potential of cancer cells . 3 . Discussion Our characterization of the cellular functions of ABRACL in this study has demon - strated that ABRACL is a conserved regulator of actin and cell migration . The low - migration phenotype of Dictyostelium cells with a knockout allele of the gene encoding the ABRACL ortholog Costars [ 6 ] was recapitulated in human cancer cells depleted of ABRACL expression . Our data also suggest that ABRACL , just like Dictyostelium Costars , can associate with the actin cytoskeleton , localize to the leading edge of migrating cells , and interact with coﬁlin . Together , these observations support the possibility that ABRACL and its orthologs serve a fundamental molecular function in regulating cellular actin dynamics and thereby modulating cell motility . Although ABRACL resembles the F - actin - binding domain of ABRA , the binding of puriﬁed recombinant ABRACL to F - actin observed in in vitro co - sedimentation assays was not robust . It has been reported that two separate yet co - dependent regions ( aa 234 – 279 and 346 – 375 ) in ABRA are required for its actin - binding ; deleting either region abolishes the association of ABRA with F - actin [ 7 ] . Structural and functional dissection of ABRA has further deﬁned two F - actin - binding domains , ABD1 ( aa 193 – 296 ) and ABD2 ( aa 294 – 375 ) ; both domains can bind F - actin independently when tested in vitro , but ABD2 binds with a much lower afﬁnity than ABD1 [ 18 ] . The protein sequence of ABRACL exhibits homology mostly to ABD2 , with ~ 40 % identities and ~ 60 % similarities to aa 326 – 381 of ABRA in the Blast - 2 protein analysis ( https : / / blast . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov ( accessed on 31 January 2021 ) ) , which may explain the weak in vitro binding of ABRACL to F - actin . We have noted that Lin et al . did not detect the association between actin and ABRACL [ 9 ] ; possible explanations for this discrepancy include that the amounts of test proteins used in the assay were too small to see the small fraction of ABRACL in the co - sedimentation sample or that the His - tag in the recombinant ABRACL used had interfered with the interaction with F - actin . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 2037 14 of 21 Given the weak direct interaction of ABRACL with F - actin , we suppose that the localization of ABRACL to the F - actin - rich lamellipodia front may depend on its interac - tion with other actin regulators . It has been reported that the actin - binding domain of ABRA interacts with another two F - actin - binding proteins , i . e . , ABLIM2 and ABLIM3 [ 19 ] . However , despite the homology of ABRACL to the ABD2 domain of ABRA , we did not detect any interaction of ABRACL with these ABLIM proteins ( W . - T . Kao and M . - Y . Chen , unpublished ) . Instead , we have found that ABRACL can interact with coﬁlin , and they colocalize nicely at the lamellipodia in this study . As Coﬁlin is known to bind to F - actin [ 13 ] , it is conceivable that ABRACL localizes to the F - actin - rich region through interacting with coﬁlin . Nevertheless , as a comprehensive search for ABRACL - interacting proteins was not performed in this study , we cannot exclude the possibility that there exist other F - actin - binding or lamellipodia - localizing cellular proteins responsible for the localization of ABRACL to the leading edge of migrating cells . The effects of Costars family members on F - and G - actin homeostasis appear to be dependent on the cellular context . Our previous work has demonstrated that the depletion of the Dictyostelium Costars increases the cellular F - actin content [ 6 ] , while in this study , we found that the suppression of ABRACL expression lowered the F / G - actin ratio in cancer cells . These opposing observations are unlikely caused by a difference in the intrinsic activity of the two orthologs . This is because the expression of the human ABRACL can rescue phenotypes of Dictyostelium cells lacking Costars [ 6 ] , which indicates that human ABRACL and Costars function similarly in the context of Dictyostelium cells . A probable explanation for the different effects between depleting ABRACL and Costars on actin dynamics is that the repertoires of actin regulators in these cells are different . Findings in this study do suggest that ABRACL may coordinate with other cellular actin regulators , of which a good candidate is coﬁlin , to cause a net effect of promoting the distribution of cellular actin to the polymerized pool . While the expression of ABRACL in ABRACL - knockout cells elevated the F - actin levels , the puriﬁed ABRACL protein alone did not promote actin polymerization or inhibit F - actin depolymerization in vitro ; instead , the presence of ABRACL decelerated the coﬁlin - stimulated F - actin depolymerization in vitro . Given the evidence of physical interaction between ABRACL and coﬁlin we obtained in this study , it is also possible that ABRACL exerts its cellular function by modulating the activity of coﬁlin . Coﬁlin has multifaceted functions on actin dynamics ; it can sever the actin ﬁlaments and promote F - actin depolymerization , while , under certain circumstances , also facilitate actin polymerization via generating free barbed ends and increasing the pool of actin monomers [ 13 , 14 , 20 – 22 ] . As the actin cytoskeleton is temporally and spatially dynamic in living cells , it is not surprising that coﬁlin is tightly controlled by signaling pathways and regulatory molecules in achieving its speciﬁc spatiotemporal activation . For example , the phosphorylation status of the Ser - 3 residue of coﬁlin , which is regu - lated by speciﬁc kinases and phosphatases , such as LIMK1 and Slingshot , can control the activity of coﬁlin [ 23 , 24 ] . Coﬁlin is also negatively regulated via binding to membrane phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) , and hence , signaling events - induced local hydrolysis of PIP 2 can result in spatially - conﬁned activation of coﬁlin [ 25 , 26 ] . Studies have also demonstrated the modulation of coﬁlin activity by other actin - binding proteins ; examples include the cyclase - associated proteins CAP1 and CAP2 , which bind to F - actin and enhance coﬁlin - mediated actin severing [ 27 ] , and coactosin - like 1 ( COTL1 ) , which also associates with F - actin , but antagonizes coﬁlin - mediated actin depolymerization [ 28 ] . Here we have demonstrated in vitro that ABRACL can pose a negative effect on the activity of coﬁlin . Determining whether ABRACL represents another cellular regulator of coﬁlin requires further investigation . This study has uncovered a role of ABRACL in supporting optimal cell proliferation , which was not previously discovered for Dictyostelium Costars , and has also established an association of ABRACL expression with tumorigenic growth . To date , very few reports have mentioned high expression of ABRACL in cancers . A proteomic approach for biomarkers previously found ABRACL in the uterine aspirates of patients with endometrial cancer , Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 2037 15 of 21 but not in aspirates from healthy subjects [ 29 ] . Another immunohistochemistry study discovered that ABRACL was expressed at higher levels in cancerous than in normal gastric tissues , and high ABRACL expression was associated with poor clinical outcomes [ 30 ] . However , our bioinformatics analysis suggests the upregulation of ABRACL as a common molecular alteration associated with cancer pathogenesis , as it is observed in various types of cancer . The functional signiﬁcance of ABRACL in tumorigenesis and cancer progression is supported by our ﬁndings that ABRACL is overexpressed in cancerous tissues and that cancer cells with ABRACL expression , rather than cells depleted of ABRACL , migrate more robustly , proliferate better , and are more capable of generating colonies even under anchorage - independent conditions . The molecular mechanisms involved in the function of ABRACL in tumorigenesis remain to be elucidated . An important issue to address in future investigations is whether such mechanisms are dependent on the activity of ABRACL in regulating the actin dynam - ics . There is increasing evidence in the literature to support that actin and actin regulators play important roles in the mechanisms underlying carcinogenesis and cancer progression . In addition to the involvement of dynamic actin remodeling in forming cellular protrusions to support the migration and invasion of cancer cells during cancer progression , it has also been established that actin has essential functions in fundamental nuclear processes , such as transcription , chromatin remodeling , RNA processing , DNA replication , and DNA repair [ 31 – 34 ] ; dysregulation of these processes often occurs in cancer pathogenesis . Of those which have been found in the nucleus , dozens of actin - binding proteins serve to reg - ulate actin dynamics and control the levels of nuclear actin monomers and polymers [ 31 ] ; interestingly , coﬁlin is among these nuclear actin regulators . Other than being involved in the regulation of actin dynamics , coﬁlin can interact with importin - 9 and facilitate the transport of actin into the nucleus [ 35 ] , and also play a role in the RNA polymerase II transcriptional machinery [ 36 ] ; perturbation of these coﬁlin functions may affect the cellular transcriptional program and lead to pathogenic changes . The role of ABRACL in regulating functions of nuclear coﬁlin and nuclear actin warrants further exploration . In conclusion , this study demonstrates that the human Costars family protein ABRACL has the conserved function in regulating actin and cell migration and also highlights ABRACL as a molecular player in cancer pathogenesis . 4 . Materials and Methods 4 . 1 . Cell Culture and Transfection Cell lines were originally obtained from Bioresource Collection and Research Center , Taiwan . Cells were cultured in media containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) at 37 ◦ C with 5 % CO 2 . MDA - MB - 231 cells were cultured in DMEM - F12 ( Gibco , Grand Island , NY , USA ) with the supplement of non - essential amino acids and L - glutamine ( 2 mM ) . HCT116 cells were cultured in the McCoy’s 5A medium ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) , while SW620 cells were cultured in the Leibovitz’s L - 15 medium ( Gibco , Grand Island , NY , USA ) . For transfection , lipofectamine 2000 was used according to the manufacturer’s instruction ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . 4 . 2 . Plasmids and Primers Plasmids and primers used in this study are listed in Table S1 . 4 . 3 . Lentivirus - Delivered shRNA - Mediated Gene Knockdown The expression of ABRACL or the coﬁlin gene ( CFL1 ) was silenced using a lentivirus - based method following the protocol suggested by the RNA Technology Platform and Gene Manipulation Core ( Academia Sinica , Taipei , Taiwan ) . Two ABRACL - targeting short hair - pin sequences ( Sh295 and Sh484 ) and one CFL1 - targeting short hairpin sequence ( shCFL1 - 1 ) were cloned into pLKO plasmid . Each shRNA - expressing plasmid was mixed with two other vectors , pMD . G , which expresses VSV - G envelope glycoprotein and pCMV ∆ R8 . 91 , which contains gag , pol and rev genes for packaging lentivirus , and transfected into 70 % Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 2037 16 of 21 conﬂuent 293 T cells for lentivirus production . After 18 h , the culture medium was replaced with 1 % BSA ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) - containing DMEM ( Gibco , Grand Island , NY , USA ) to improve virus yield . Culture medium containing lentivirus was collected and tested for relative infection unit by cell viability assay . For gene knockdown , cells were infected with the shRNA - expressing lentivirus and selected in puromycin ( 1 µ g / mL ) for 3 days and subsequently examined for ABRACL or coﬁlin expression by Western analysis . 4 . 4 . CRISPR / Cas9 - Mediated ABRACL Knockout The knockout of the ABRACL gene was performed using a CRISPR / Cas9 - based method previously described [ 34 ] . An ABRACL - targeting gRNA - expressing vector and a Cas9 - expressing vector were co - transfected into HCT116 or MDA - MB - 231 cells using lipo - fectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . Two ABRACL - targeting gRNA sequences were used : G2 ( 5 (cid:48) - GCGAGGTTAACCTCTTAGTGG - 3 (cid:48) ) and G3 ( 5 (cid:48) - GATGAATTTCCTCCAC TAAG - 3 (cid:48) ) . Transfected cells were allowed to recover for 48 h and subsequently re - plated at a density of ~ 50 cells / 10 cm dish . After incubation for 15 days , colonies were collected and examined for ABRACL expression by Western analysis . Candidate clones with no de - tectable ABRACL expression were further conﬁrmed by sequencing the PCR ampliﬁcation products of the ABRACL genomic locus . 4 . 5 . Migration Assays For the Transwell migration assay , 2 – 5 × 10 5 HCT116 cells in serum - free medium or 5 × 10 4 MDA - MB231 cells in 0 . 5 % FBS - containing medium were seeded in the upper chamber of Millicell insert ( Merck KGaA , Darmstadt , Germany ) and incubated for 6 or 12 h with 10 % FBS - supplemented medium in the lower chamber . Cells that migrated across the membrane in the insert were ﬁxed , stained with crystal violet and counted . The migration index was calculated by normalizing the number of migrating cells in each test sample to that obtained in the control sample . For the in vitro wound healing migration assay , 1 × 10 5 MDA - MB231 cells were seeded into the culture insert ( cat . no . 80209 ; ibidi , Gräfelﬁng , Germany ) and allowed to adhere . The culture insert was removed to make an in vitro “wound” , and images of the wound area were taken at 0 , 6 , and 12 h , respectively . To assess the EGF - stimulated cell migration , seeded cells were incubated in serum - free medium for 16 h before the removal of the culture insert and the change to fresh serum - free medium or EGF ( 10 ng / mL ) - supplemented medium at time 0 ; micrographic images of the wound area were taken at 0 and 6 h , respectively . The area of the wound region was measured using ImageJ software , and the extent of wound closure relative to that of the parental cells was calculated . 4 . 6 . Cell Morphology Analysis Cells were cultured on ﬁbronectin - coated coverslips and ﬁxed in 3 . 7 % paraformalde - hyde in 1X phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . Cells were subsequently permeabilized in 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 in PBS and stained in a 50 µ g / mL TRITC - phalloidin ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) solution in PBS at room temperature . Cell morphology and actin organization were examined using differential interference contrast ( DIC ) and ﬂuorescence microscopy . Microscopic images of stained cells were captured and analyzed using either Zeiss AxioVision or ImageJ software to calculate the average cell area . At least 3 indepen - dent experiments were performed , and a total of more than 150 cells were analyzed for each cell clone or test condition . 4 . 7 . Puriﬁcation of Recombinant Proteins for In Vitro Assays Recombinant GST and GST - ABRACL proteins were expressed in E . coli and puriﬁed by GST pulldown procedures using glutathione sepharose beads ( Sigma - Aldrich ; St . Louis , MO , USA ) . To remove the GST tag , each 300 µ g sample of GST - ABRACL was incubated with 1 µ g of factor Xa at 4 ◦ C for 12 h ; the digestion reaction was mixed with the factor Xa removal resin ( Qiagen , Frederick , MD , USA ) to stop the reaction and remove factor Xa Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 2037 17 of 21 and subjected to another round of GST - pulldown procedures to remove GST . Recombinant His - coﬁlin was expressed in E . coli and puriﬁed by His tag pulldown procedures using Ni 2 + - NTA agarose beads ( Millipore , Darmstadt , Germany ) . Preparations of puriﬁed proteins were placed in Amicon Ultra - 0 . 5 mL centrifugal devices to remove the elution buffer and equilibrate in an appropriate assay buffer . 4 . 8 . In Vitro F - Actin Co - Sedimentation Assay The interaction between ABRACL and F - actin was tested in this co - sedimentation assay . Rabbit skeletal muscle actin ( Cytoskeleton , Inc . , Denver , CO , USA ) was diluted to 0 . 1 mg / mL , incubated on ice for 30 min and subsequently allowed to polymerize in 1X actin polymerization buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM ATP in 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 ) at room temperature for 1 h . Puriﬁed recombinant ABRACL was mixed with the F - actin formed in the polymerization reaction and incubated at room temperature for 30 min ; a sample of α - actinin puriﬁed from rabbit skeletal muscle ( Cytoskeleton , Inc . , Denver , CO , USA ) was also mixed with the F - actin as a positive F - actin - binding control . After centrifugation at 150 , 000 × g for 90 min , equivalent fractions of supernatants and pellets were subjected to SDS – PAGE and the gel was stained with Coomassie blue to visualize the separated proteins . 4 . 9 . Analysis of the Cellular F / G - Actin Ratio Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer ( 50 mM PIPES pH 6 . 9 , 50 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 5 % ( v / v ) glycerol , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 , 0 . 1 % 2 - mercaptoethanol ) freshly supplemented with 100 mM ATP and 1X protease inhibitor ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) before use . Aliquots of lysates containing equal amounts of cellular proteins were subjected to centrifugation at 2000 × rpm for 15 min to eliminate the cell debris , and the supernatant fraction from each sample was subjected to high - speed centrifugation ( 55 , 000 × rpm in a TLA100 . 3 rotor of Beckman Coulter Inc . ) for 1 h . The resulting supernatant ( G - actin ) and pellet ( F - actin ) fractions were examined for the amount of actin using Western analysis . Actin signals in G - and F - actin fractions were quantitated using MultiGauge software to determine the F / G - actin ratio . Relative F / G - actin ratios were calculated by normalizing to the ratio of the control sample . 4 . 10 . Immunoﬂuorescence Cell Staining Cells were cultured on ﬁbronectin - coated coverslips , ﬁxed in 3 . 7 % paraformalde - hyde in PBS , and permeabilized in 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 in PBS . After incubation in the blocking solution ( 10 % FBS in PBS ) for 1 h , cells on the coverslip were incubated with rabbit anti - ABRACL ( 1 : 400 ; Sigma - Aldrich Cat . # HPA030217 , St . Louis , MO , USA ) and mouse anti - coﬁlin primary antibodies ( 1 : 400 ; Santa Cruz E - 8 , Dallas , TX , USA ) , and sub - sequently with FITC - conjugated anti - rabbit IgG and TRITC - conjugated anti - mouse IgG secondary antibodies , respectively . Fluorescence signals were captured under a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope . Colocalization of ﬂuorescence signals was analyzed using MetaMorph software . 4 . 11 . Duolink In Situ Proximity Ligation Assay ( PLA ) Duolink™ PLA ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) was used for detecting the interaction between endogenous ABRACL and coﬁlin in situ within the cell . In this assay , two test proteins are ﬁrst recognized by individual primary antibodies raised in different species . Next , two secondary antibodies conjugated with speciﬁc DNA - oligonucleotide ( i . e . , PLA probes ) are added to bind to individual primary antibodies . If the two proteins of interest are close enough in situ , a connector oligonucleotide added into the reaction will hybridize and join the PLA probes to form a circular DNA structure . Following a ligation step , the circular DNA template can be ampliﬁed by DNA polymerase via a rolling - circle ampliﬁcation process to generate copies of DNA for subsequent detection by ﬂuorochrome - coupled probes [ 37 ] . For observing the interaction between ABRACL and coﬁlin in situ , Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 2037 18 of 21 cells were cultured on ﬁbronectin - coated 18 mm chamber slides for 24 h before being ﬁxed in 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized in 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 in PBS . After incubation in the blocking solution for 1 h at 37 ◦ C , washed in PBS , cells on the slides were incubated overnight with rabbit anti - ABRACL ( 1 : 400 ; Sigma - Aldrich Cat . # HPA030217 , St . Louis , MO , USA ) and mouse anti - coﬁlin primary antibodies ( 1 : 400 ; Santa Cruz E - 8 , Dallas , TX , USA ) at 4 ◦ C . After washing in TBST , PLA probes were added to the slides and PLA was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) . The Duolink™ ﬂuorescent detection red ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) was used for the visualization of protein interaction . The slides were subsequently subjected to Hoechst staining for DNA or stained with FITC - phalloidin to visualize F - actin . 4 . 12 . In Vitro Actin Polymerization and Depolymerization Assays A commercially available kit ( Cytoskeleton , Inc . Cat . no . BK003 , Denver , CO , USA ) was used to assess the effects of puriﬁed recombinant proteins on actin polymerization or depolymerization . For the polymerization assay , pyrene G - actin was freshly prepared following the manufacturer’s protocol and 200 µ L aliquots of 0 . 4 mg / mL pyrene G - actin were loaded onto a 96 - well plate placed in the ﬂuorimeter ( TECAN - Inﬁnite 200 PRO , Tecan Trading AG , Switzerland ) . The emitted ﬂuorescence was recorded every min . After monitoring the baseline ﬂuorescence for 3 min , 20 µ L samples of puriﬁed ABRACL ( or test buffer as a control ) were added , and the mixtures were further incubated for 25 min . Next , 20 µ L of 10X actin polymerization buffer was added to activate actin polymerization , and the reading was continued until 2 h . For the depolymerization assay , pyrene F - actin samples were freshly prepared following the manufacturer’s instruction and diluted to 0 . 2 mg / mL . Aliquots ( 200 µ L ) of pyrene F - actin were mixed with puriﬁed recombinant proteins ( or test buffer as a control ) , and the mixtures were loaded onto a 96 - well plate . The emitted ﬂuorescence was taken every min by the ﬂuorimeter for 2 h . For plotting the results of both assays , the average value of the recorded ﬂuorescence at three time points before adding puriﬁed protein ( ABRACL and / or coﬁlin ) was calculated , and the ﬂuorescence readings at the following time points were normalized to this average value to eliminate the basal ﬂuorescence difference between samples . 4 . 13 . Clinical Tissue Samples A total of 147 formalin - ﬁxed , parafﬁn - embedded clinical specimens of surgically resected primary colorectal carcinomas were obtained without any bias of gender or age from the archived tissues at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital ( Taipei - VGH ) . For constructing the tissue microarray ( TMA ) , representative areas of the tumor were selected , and a 3 mm tissue core was retrieved from the parafﬁn block of each case . Clinical data were collected retrospectively and received as de - identiﬁed patient data from the hospital - based data registry . The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Taipei - VGH , Taiwan ( IRB No . 2020 - 04 - 011BC ) . 4 . 14 . Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) Analysis TMA sections ( 5 µ m ) were deparafﬁnized , de - waxed and dehydrated through xylene and graded alcohol treatments , immersed in the antigen - retrieval buffer , processed for endogenous peroxidase blocking , and incubated with the primary antibody ( 1 : 400 ; rabbit anti - ABRACL ; Sigma - Aldrich Cat . # HPA030217 , St . Louis , MO , USA ) . The specimens were then processed through the polymer detection system ( Novolink Polymer detection kit ; Le - ica Biosystems , Buffalo Grove , IL , USA ) , dehydrated and counterstained with hematoxylin . The expression of ABRACL was scored independently by pathologists at the Veterans General Hospital , Taipei . The level of ABRACL was graded by the intensity of staining ( 0 , absent ; 1 , weak ; 2 , moderate ; and 3 , strong ) ( Figure 8B ) . The scores of 0 – 1 and 2 – 3 were deﬁned as low and high expression , respectively . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 2037 19 of 21 4 . 15 . Cell Proliferation Assay The WST - 1 assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) . The WST - 1 reagent is a tetrazolium salt , which can be converted to a colored product formazan by mitochondrial enzymes in living cells . Therefore , the amount of the colored product generated is proportional to the number of viable cells , and spectrophotometric quantiﬁcation of the product can be used for the measurement of cell proliferation and viability . In this assay , cells were seeded ( at 1000 cells / well ) in 96 - well plates in triplicates and grown for 1 – 5 days at 37 ◦ C in 5 % CO 2 . At each time point , WST - 1 reagent was added to each well and mixed by shaking the plate on a rotary shaker at 150 × rpm ; the mixtures were incubated for 2 h before values of absorbance at 450 nm ( test wavelength ) , and 690 nm ( reference wavelength ) were measured to determine the percentage of live cells . 4 . 16 . Colony Formation Assay Cells were seeded at a density of 1000 cells / well on 6 - well plates and allowed to grow for 10 days . Colonies were stained with 5 % Giemsa ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) . Areas and staining intensity of the colonies were analyzed using ImageJ software equipped with the ColonyArea plug - in . 4 . 17 . Anchorage - Independent Growth Assay Cells ( 1000 cells / dish ) in 0 . 4 % low melting point agarose were plated on top of a 1 % agar layer in 3 . 5 cm culture dishes and incubated for 15 days . Colonies were ﬁxed in methanol , stained with crystal violet , and analyzed using the ImageJ software . 4 . 18 . Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis of ABRACL expression in clinical specimens was performed using SPSS 17 . 0 software . Continuous and categorical variables were evaluated by Student’s t - test and Pearson’s chi - squared ( χ 2 ) test , respectively . All reported p - values were for two - sided tests , and results with a p - value smaller than 0 . 05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant .
