Platelet Structure Platelets have an average diameter of 2 to 5 µm , a thickness of 0 . 5 µm , and a mean cell volume of 6 to 10 ﬂ . 9 For convenience , the structure of the platelet can be conceptually divided in a peripheral zone , a sol - gel zone , an organelle zone , and membrane systems . 10 Peripheral Zone The platelet plasma membrane is relatively smooth and has a thicker glycocalyx ( GP – polysaccharide covering ) than other blood cells . In high - resolution electron microscopy , it shows a wrinkled appearance with many tiny folds and the randomly distributed apertures of the open canalicular system . 10 , 11 The glycocalyx as the platelet ’ s exterior coat is a dynamic structure and the site of ﬁ rst contact with the surrounding milieu . It contains surface GPs required for the interaction of platelets with subendothelial structures of the injured vessel wall , platelet activation , platelet adhesion and aggregation , as well as clot retraction . 12 In particular , the mobile receptor complexes GPIb - IX - V and integrin α IIb β 3 are abundantly expressed on the surface of resting platelets and are of great importance in hemostasis ( see below ) . 13 , 14 Below the glycocalyx is the lipid bilayer , 15 which is incompressible and unstretchable . Consequently , additional membrane needed for platelet spreadingmust be provided by the tiny folds of the platelet surface and the internalized membrane parts of the open canalicular system . 16 The lipid bilayer appears morphologically similar to the unit mem - branes of other cell types but plays an important role in blood coagulation . It contains tissue factor ( TF ) , which is exposed on Keywords ► platelet function ► platelet structure ► platelet granules ► platelet surface glycoproteins ► platelet activation pathways ► platelet physiology ► review Abstract Platelets are the smallest blood cells , numbering 150 to 350 (cid:1) 10 9 / L in healthy individuals .

Through the interaction of these coagulation factors with the meanwhile decryptedTF , thrombingeneration is enhanced on thesurface of activated platelets as well as on platelet - derived MP . 10 The platelet ’ s submembrane area lies directly under the lipid bilayer and is of great importance for platelet function . It contains a system of thin actin ﬁ laments — the membrane contractile cytoskeleton — which is required for platelet shape change and the translocation of receptors and particles over the platelet ’ s surface . 18 In the submembrane compartment , the cytoplasmic domains of all transmem - brane receptors interact with proteins , many of which are associated with calmodulin , myosin , and actin ﬁ laments that constitute the above - mentioned cytoskeleton . 19 Thereby , they regulate the signaling processes required for platelet activation . Sol - Gel Zone The transparent yet viscous matrix inside platelets is labeled the sol - gel zone . It resembles liquid gel and contains organized microtubules and micro ﬁ laments , randomly distributed glycogen , a few smooth and clathrin - coated vesicles , as well as secretory organelles . Microtubules are arranged in circumferential coils close tothe cellwall , thereby forming a system that supports the membrane contractile cytoskeleton . 20 – 22 Various experimental approaches strongly suggest that microtubules are needed for maintaining the discoid shape of human platelets . 23 , 24 Actin micro ﬁ laments in the sol - gel zone form the cytoplasmic actin ﬁ lament cytoskeleton , the matrix in which all organelles are suspended and which keeps organelles apart from each other and from the cell wall in the resting platelet . 10 , 25 Following platelet activation , the cytoplasmic actin system constricts the microtubule coils moving α - granules and dense bodies to the platelet center , 26 which may ultimately result in the secretion of their contents through the open canalicular system . 25 , 27 Organelle Zone Three major types of secretory organelles are present in platelets : α - granules , dense granules , and lysosomes ( ► Table 1 ) . In addition , platelets contain simple mitochon - dria , which are important for their energy metabolism , glycosomes , 28 electron dense chains and clusters , 29 and tubular inclusions . 30 α - granules have a round to oval shapewith a diameter of 200 to 500 nm . An average human platelet contains 50 to 80 α - granules , which makes them the most frequent organelles . 31 , 32 In resting platelets , α - granules are separated from each other by the cytoplasmic actin ﬁ lament cytoskeleton . The fusion of α - granules during long - term platelet storage is a ﬁ rst sign of cell damage . 33 In vivo , fusion of α - granules resulting in giant α - granules is seen in patients with Paris – Trousseau – Jacobsen syndrome , 34 White platelet syndrome , 35 and Medich giant platelet disorder . 30 While the submembrane zone of α - granules contains von Willebrand factor ( VWF ) in tube - like structures , 36 various proteins are found in their peripheral zone including megakaryocyte - synthesized proteins such as coagulation factor V , thrombospondin , P - selectin , and VWF , as well as externally synthesized proteins taken up by platelets ( e . g . ﬁ brinogen ) . The α - granule ’ s central zone appears denser than its peripheral zone potentially indicating the presence of proteins with binding sites for heavy metals . 10 The three to eight dense granules per normal human platelet are smaller than α - granules and display great mor - phological variability . 37 Their most prominent feature is an electron - opaque spherical structure , which is usually sur - rounded by an empty space . However , in some dense gran - ules , this space is traversed by ﬁ laments or ﬁ lled with a granule - likesubstance . 10 Besides adenine nucleotides such as adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) and adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) , dense granules contain serotonin , pyrophosphate , calcium , and magnesium ( see below ) . Other electron - opaque structures in the cytoplasm are chains and clusters of hexagonal beads which are present in 2 to 22 % of human platelets and seem to increase with age . 29 The origin and function of these electron - dense formations remains unknown . It was previously speculated that elec - tron - dense chains and clusters represent precursors of dense granules , but this hypothesis was abandoned after studying patients with storage pool diseases , whose platelets lacked dense granules while containing the usual amount of chains and clusters . 38 Human platelets also contain 0 to 2 spherical lysosomes , which are slightly smaller than α - granules . Their content comprises at least 13 acid hydrolases , cathepsin D and E , lysosomal - associated membrane protein ( LAMP ) - 2 , and CD63 , and can be released in response to strong platelet stimulation in vitro . However , the role of lysosomes in platelet function and hemostasis remains largely unknown . 10 Fig . 1 Platelets in thrombosis .

The glycogen - containing platelet glycosome is another component of the platelet ’ s organelle zone . 28 Glycosomes have a round or oval shape , and a similar size to α - granules so that they can easily be confused with glycogen - bearing α - granules . Tubular inclusions , which often contain glycogen as well , can be discriminated from glycosomes by their multi - lamellar membrane . Finally , mitochondria are seen in the organelle zone . Despite their low number and simple structure , they provide the platelet ’ s energy requirements , and make sure that a blockade of anaerobic glycolysis does not impair platelet function . Although mitochondria are also seen as important providers of calcium by some authors , other investigations favor the dense tubular system and extracellular calcium as the major calcium sources in platelet activation . 39 Membrane Systems Besides the outer plasma membrane , the membrane systems in human platelets comprise Golgi complexes , the surface - connected open canalicularsystem , the densetubular system , and the rough endoplasmic reticulum . Residues of megakaryocytic Golgi complexes are observed in less than 1 % of normal human platelets but can be found more frequently in patients with certain hypogranular plate - letdisorders . 35 , 40 The presenceof Golgicomplexes inplatelets from patients with hypogranular syndromes such as White platelet syndrome may indicate ongoing granulopoiesis . 35 The open canalicular system is a part of the platelet ’ s surface membrane , which extends toward the interior of the platelet and in doing so forms a tubular structure , 41 – 43 which exerts three major functions . Its channels can be used for the transport of plasma components such as ﬁ brinogen to α - granules 44 – 46 and can also serve as route for the release of granular contents during platelet activation . 27 Moreover , the channels of the open canalicular system can be evaginated and thereby provide membrane parts needed for platelet spreading following platelet adhesion to an injured vessel wall . 47 Through this mechanism , activated platelets are able to increase their surface area more than fourfold compared with resting discoid platelets . 48 The dense tubular system is a residuum of the parent megakaryocyte ’ s smooth endoplasmic reticulum and consists ofchannels randomly dispersed in the plateletcytoplasm . The channels are separated from the canaliculi of the open canalicular system which appear empty by electron micros - copy and — in contrast to them — contain an amorphous sub - stance resembling the surrounding cytoplasm in opacity . 41 Channels of rough endoplasmic reticulum are only seen in patients with fast platelet turnover due to immune throm - bocytopenia and are then usually studded with ribosomes . 10 Platelet Granules Platelet granules were ﬁ rst described in the late 19th century , but it took until 1966 to differentiate dense granules from α - granules , 49 and another year to distinguish the latter from lysosomes by the then newly developed method of electron microscopy ( ► Table 1 ) . 50 Formation of Platelet Granules The formation of platelet granules is initiated in the mega - karyocyte , but their maturation continues in the circulating platelet . 51 α - Granules The proteins stored in α - granules are provided by synthesis and endocytosis . While synthesized proteins are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the trans - Golgi network , where they are packaged in immature granules , 52 , 53 plasma proteins are taken up by megakaryocytes via the endocytotic pathway and uptake of plasma proteins via this pathway continues in the mature platelet . 51 Membrane traf ﬁ cking required for both pathways is mediated by coat proteins such as clathrin , adaptor proteins ( AP ) - 1 , AP - 2 , AP - 3 , and other vesicle traf ﬁ cking proteins , for example , soluble N - ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion protein ( NSF ) attachment protein receptors ( SNAREs ) and monomeric GTPases such as Rabs . Thus , for both pathways , clathrin - coated vesicles are formed through membrane invagination under the in ﬂ uence of AP . 51 However , differences exist : AP - 1 appears to play a pivotal role in the synthetic pathway , 31 whereas AP - 2 mediates endocytosis . 54 The resulting vesicles from the trans - Golgi network or the plasma membrane are then moved to multivesicular bodies , which represent transient structures at an intermediate stage of Table 1 General features of platelet granule types Number / platelet Diameter ( nm ) Surface area ( µm 2 ) / platelet Common markers General function α - granules 50 – 80 200 – 500 14 VWFCXCL4 ( PF4 ) P - selectin Hemostasis / thrombosis In ﬂ ammation AngiogenesisHostdefenseMitogenesis Dense granules 3 – 8 150 < 1 CD63Serotonin Hemostasis / thrombosis In ﬂ ammation Lysosomes < 3 200 – 250 < 1 Acid phosphatase Endosomal digestion Abbreviations : CXCL4 , chemokine ( C – X – C motif ) ligand 4 ; PF4 , platelet factor 4 ; VWF , von Willebrand factor .

During megakaryopoiesis , dense granules appear concomitantly with α - granules , and like α - granules , early dense granules are also sorted in multivesicular bodies . 56 Their content becomes denser as they mature , most likely due to increased membrane pump activity . 51 Granule Content α - Granules α - granules contain membrane - associated and soluble proteins , which are involved in various processes including cell adhesion , coagulation , in ﬂ ammation , cellgrowth , and host defense ( ► Table 2 ) . Following platelet activation , membrane - bound granule proteins are expressed on the platelet surface , whereas soluble granule proteins are released into the extra - cellular compartment . Most of the membrane - bound proteins are already present on the surface of resting platelets , 37 for example , integrins such as α IIb β 3 , immunoglobulin family receptors such as GPVI , Fc receptors ( FcR ) , platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule , the GPIb - IX - V complex , tetraspanins , CD36 , and Glut - 3 . 64 , 65 However , some membrane - associated proteins including ﬁ brocystin L , CD109 , and P - selectin are exclusively expressed on the surface of activated , rather than resting , platelets . 64 In particular , platelet surface P - selectin expression is therefore widely used as a sensitive ﬂ ow cytometric marker of platelet activation ( ► Fig . 2 ) . 66 – 68 Proteins in platelet releasate can derive from different platelet granules , exosomes , and from cleavage of initially surface - bound proteins . However , proteomic analyses have identi ﬁ ed more than 300 soluble proteins released by α - granules . 64 , 69 Many of the released proteins are also found in human plasma , prompting questions as to how the α - granule constituents differ from their plasma counterparts in struc - ture or function . Dense Granules Platelet dense granules contain high concentrations of adenine nucleotides , namely , ADP and ATP , 70 uracil and guanine nucleotides , calcium , and potassium ( ► Table 3 ) . Moreover , polyphosphates and bioactive amines such as serotonin and histamine are present in platelet dense granules . 71 , 72 The milieu within platelet dense granules is kept at a pH of approximately 5 . 4 by a H þ - ATPase Table 2 α - granule contents Type Examples Integral membrane proteins α IIb β 3 , GPIb - IX - V , GPVI , P - selectin Coagulants , anticoagulants , and ﬁ brinolytic proteins Factors V , IX , XIII , antithrombin , protein S , tissue factor pathway inhibitor , plasminogen , α 2 - macroglobulin Adhesion proteins Fibrinogen , von Willebrand factor , thrombospondin Chemokines CXCL1 ( GRO - α ) , CXCL4 ( PF4 ) , CXCL5 ( ENA - 78 ) , CXCL8 ( IL8 ) , CCL2 ( MCP - 1 ) , CCL3 ( MIP - 1 α ) , CCL5 ( RANTES ) Growth factors Epidermal growth factor , hepatocyte growth factor , insulin - like growth factor , transforming growth factor β Angiogenic factors and inhibitors Vascular endothelium growth factor , ﬁ broblast growth factor , platelet - derived growth factor , angiostatin , endostatin Microbicidal proteins Thymosin - β 4 , thrombocidins1 and 2 Immune mediators Complement C3 precursor , complement C4 precursor , IgG Abbreviations : CCL , chemokine ( C – C motif ) ligand ; CXCL , chemokine ( C – X – C motif ) ligand ; ENA - 78 , epithelial - derived neutrophil - activating peptide 78 ; GP , glycoprotein ; GRO - α , growth - regulated oncogene α ; IgG , immunoglobulin G ; IL8 , interleukin 8 ; MCP - 1 , monocyte chemotactic protein 1 ; MIP - 1 α , macrophage in ﬂ ammatory protein 1 α ; PF4 , platelet factor 4 ; RANTES , regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted .

The latter may also concentrate histamine into platelet dense granules . 75 GPIb , integrin α IIb β 3 , CD63 ( granulophysin ) , and LAMP - 2 are among the Fig . 2 Platelet function and molecular targets of antiplatelet agents . Initial platelet adhesion to damaged vessel walls is mediated by the binding of exposed collagen to platelet surface GPVI and integrin α 2 β 1 and by the binding of VWF to the platelet surface GPIb - IX - Vcomplex . This complex is also a receptor for other platelet ligands ( thrombospondin , collagen , and P - selectin ) , leukocyte integrin α M β 2 , and procoagulant factors ( thrombin , kininogen , factor XI , and factor XII ) . Thrombin , generated by the coagulation cascade , is a potent activator of human platelets through two platelet surface receptors : PAR - 1 and PAR - 4 . Three groups of platelet surface receptors provide important positive feedback loops for platelet activation : P2Y 1 and P2Y 12 are stimulated by ADP released from platelet dense granules ; 5HT 2A receptors ( 5HT 2A ) are stimulated by 5HT ( also known as serotonin ) released from platelet dense granules ; and the thromboxane prostanoid ( TP ) receptor is stimulated by TXA 2 generated by the platelet COX1 - dependent signaling pathway . Platelet - to - platelet aggregation is mediated by ﬁ brinogen and , at high shear ﬂ ow , by VWF binding to activated integrin α IIb β 3 . Perpetuation of platelet - to - platelet aggregation is augmented by other receptors , including JAMA and JAMC , growth - arrest speci ﬁ c gene 6 receptor and ephrin . Platelet - monocyte adhesion is initially mediated by the binding of platelet surface P - selectin to its constitutively expressed cognate receptor , PSGL1 , on the monocyte surface . Activated platelets , monocytes , and microparticles bind coagulation factors and provide a surface for the generation of a ﬁ brin clot . Approved antiplatelet agents and their molecular targets are shown in boxes . Indirect inhibitors ( UFH , LMWH ) and direct inhibitors ( lepirudin , argatroban , bivalirudin , and dabigatran ) of thrombin , unlike PAR - 1 antagonists , are anticoagulants rather than speci ﬁ c antiplatelet drugs . However , their inhibition of thrombin results in reduced platelet activation . Investigational strategies for novel antiplatelet agents are shown by the symbols adjacent to : GPIb - IX - V , GPVI , α 2 β 1 , EP 3 , 5HT 2A , P2Y 1 , P2Y 12 , PSGL1 , PI3K β , α IIb β 3 , and the TP receptor .

LAMP - 1 , LAMP - 2 , and CD63 are found in the lysosomal membrane in a highly glycosylated state and support its protective function . 51 Granule Secretion Mechanisms of Platelet Granule Secretion Membrane fusion plays a key role in platelet granule secretion . Following platelet activation , plateletgranules accumulate in the cell center during platelet shape change , and may fuse with one another in homotypic fusion . 77 In a further step , granules fuse withtheopencanalicularsystem releasing theircontents into its channels and thereby ﬁ nally to the extracellular space . 45 , 78 Another mechanism of granule release is the direct fusion of plateletgranules with the plasma membrane . 79 Soluble N - ethyl - maleimide - sensitive factor attachment protein receptors ( SNAREs ) on platelet granules , namely , vesicular SNAREs ( vSNAREs ) and so - called target SNAREs ( tSNAREs ) , associated with the plasma membrane and the open canalicular system mediate the fusion of platelet granules with one another , the opencanalicularsystemandtheplasmamembrane . 80 , 81 Vesicle - associated membrane protein ( VAMP ) - 8 is considered the most important vSNARE for platelet granule release , whereas VAMPs - 2and - 3mayplayminorroles . 80 , 82 , 83 Syntaxins2 , 4 , 7 , 11 , and12 and SNAP - 23 , - 25 , and - 29 have been described as tSNAREs . 82 , 84 – 86 The function of SNAREs in platelet granule secretion is regulated by chaperone proteins such as the Mg 2 þ - dependent ATPase NSF . 87 NSF disassembles membrane - associated SNARE complexes thereby enabling their interaction with cognate SNAREs on opposing membranes . Its important role in the platelet release reaction is exempli ﬁ ed by studies showing that inhibitory peptides and antibodies to NSF impair platelet α - granule release . 87 , 88 Other important players in plate - let granule release are Sec1 / Munc proteins and Rab proteins , which can in ﬂ uence the function of SNAREs . 89 – 94 In addition , the membrane ’ s lipid composition affects its ability to fuse . 95 The platelet cytoskeleton is also involved in granule secretion . Although actin polymerization seems to inhibit α - granule and dense granule release in the resting platelet , 96 it facilitates granule secretion during platelet activation . 97 Furthermore , actomyosin contraction may foster granule secretion . 98 – 100 Microtubules are considered a minor player in platelet granule release since mice with microtubule de ﬁ ciencies exhibit only a modest impairment of granule secretion . 101 , 102 Similar to other cells , the increase of intracellular Ca þþ supports granule secretion in platelets . 103 Finally , several protein C kinase isoforms take part in the platelet release reaction . In particular , protein C kinase isoforms α and β support granule secretion , 104 while others differentially affect granule release . 104 – 106 Functions of Platelet Granule Secretion Platelet granule secretion is involved in hemostasis and thrombosis , in ﬂ ammation , atherogenesis , antimicrobial host defense , and mitogenesis . 51 Upon platelet activation , α - granules release ﬁ brinogen and VWF , which promote platelet – platelet and platelet – endothelial cell interactions . Furthermore , the ﬁ brinogen receptor α IIb β 3 , the collagen receptor GPVI , and components of the VWF receptor complex GPIb - IX - V , which are found in α - granules , are expressed on the platelet surface and subsequently support platelet adhesion . 37 , 107 By releasing coagulation factors such as factors V and IX , 108 α - granules also participate in secondary hemostasis . Finally , α - granules may be involved in the maintenance of hemostatic balance by secreting proteins that limit coagulation including antithrombin , protein S , and TF pathway inhibitor . 109 , 110 The contribution of α - granules to normal hemostasis is evidenced by the bleeding tendency in patients with gray platelet syndrome . 111 Based on their content , an involvement of α - granules in thrombosis is expected , 64 , 69 although their exact role remains to be determined . Dense granules participate in hemostasis and thrombosis as the primary source of ADP , which acts as a strong platelet agonist at sites of vascular injury . Moreover , the secretion of serotonin by dense granules supports platelet aggregation and promotes vascular tone , 112 while released Ca þþ and polyphosphates contribute to clot formation . 51 On the con - trary , some of the released diadenosine polyphosphates are Table 3 Dense granule contents Type Examples Cations Ca 2 þ , Mg 2 þ , K þ Phosphates Polyphosphate , pyrophosphate Bioactive amines Serotonin , histamine Nucleotides ADP , ATP , UTP , GTP Abbreviations : ADP , adenosine diphosphate ; ATP , adenosine triphos - phate ; GTP , guanosine triphosphate ; UTP , uridine triphosphate .

GPIb - IX - V Complex The GPIb - IX - Vcomplex acts as platelet surface receptor and is heavily involved in normal hemostasis as well as in arterial thrombosis . 139 , 140 Structure Human GPIb α is a type - I , membrane - spanning GP with an N - terminal , ligand - binding domain , a sialomucin core , a transmembrane region , and a cytoplasmic tail . 141 Its major ligand - binding domain comprises seven tandem leucine - rich repeats , an N - terminal capping sequence , a C - terminal ﬂ ank - ing sequence , and an anionic sequence . 139 , 142 – 144 GPIb α and GPIX are present at approximately 25 , 000 copies per platelet , whereas GPV is present at approximately 12 , 500 copies . 145 Function GPIb - IX - V propagates the adhesion of activated platelets to endothelial cells and subendothelial structures of the injured vessel wall , mainly by binding its most important ligand VWF , which is itself able to bind collagen ( ► Fig . 2 ) . 146 Another ligand for GPIb - IX - V is thrombospondin , which seems to mediate platelet adhesion at high shear rates in the absence of VWF . 147 It has been shown that GPIb α can also bind P - selectin , thereby offering another mechanism of platelet - endothelial cell and platelet – platelet interactions . 148 Further - more , α M β 2 ( Mac - 1 ) serves as a counter receptor for GPIb - IX - V , enabling the attachment of platelets to leukocytes . 149 Besides its role in platelet adhesion , GPIb - IX - V assembles procoagulant activity on activated platelets by providing binding sites for α - thrombin , factor XI , and high - molecular - weight kininogen . 142 , 150 , 151 On the contrary , the binding of factor XII to GPIb α competes with kininogen binding and inhibits thrombin - dependent platelet aggregation associated with thrombin binding to GPIb α . 152 Finally , complex signaling processes are initiated by cross - linking of GPIb - IX - V by VWF or other multivalent ligands , ultimately resulting in the activation of α IIb β 3 and ectodomain shedding of GPIb α . 140 , 141 , 153 – 155 Glycoprotein VI GPVI is the major signaling receptor for collagen on human platelets , and exerts functions in hemostasis and other platelet - mediated processes . 156 – 159 Structure GPVI belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily of recep - tors . It consists of 319 amino acids and is present at approxi - mately 3 , 700 copies per platelet . 145 , 160 GPVI comprises two extracellular immunoglobulin domains , D1 and D2 , which are connected by a peptide strand and linked to the transmem - brane domain via a glycosylated stem . 160 The cytoplasmic domain of human GPVI consists of 51 amino acids and shows an amino acid – rich area near the transmembrane region and a proline - rich area . 160 – 162 GPVI exists as a complex with the FcR γ - chain , which is expressed on platelets in monomeric and dimeric forms . 163 , 164 The monomeric form is particularly present on unactivated platelets and its af ﬁ nity for collagen is too low to allow activation in response to physiological concentrations of collagen . 165 , 166 In contrast , the dimeric form has an increased af ﬁ nity for collagen and binding of collagen to the dimeric complex may result in intracellular signals leading to the generation of further dimers . Without the FcR γ - chain , GPVI does not reach the platelet surface and collagen - induced platelet activation is not initiated . 167 Function Platelets adhere to exposed collagen ﬁ bers by binding of immo - bilized VWF to GPIb - IX - V . 160 This allows binding of collagen to Seminars in Thrombosis & Hemostasis Vol . 42 No . 3 / 2016 Platelet Physiology Gremmel et al . 197 T h i s do c u m en t w a s do w n l oaded f o r pe r s ona l u s e on l y .

Thereby , GPVI activation is reinforced , and stable platelet adhesion and spreading are promoted through binding of α 2 β 1 and α IIb β 3 to collagen and VWF , respectively . 168 , 169 Following activation by collagen and other agonists , GPVI is rapidly shed from platelet surface , most likely to prevent excessive collagen - stimulated megakaryocyte and platelet activation in the bone marrow and after minor damages to the vasculature . 160 Inherited defects in GPVI in two patients were only associated with a mild bleeding syndrome suggesting that hemostasis may not be the primary role of the GPVI receptor complex . 160 , 170 , 171 GPVI may also be involved in processes beyond hemostasis , 172 for example , in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and the development of the cardiovas - cular system . 173 , 174 Integrin α IIb β 3 Platelet surface integrin α IIb β 3 ( previously termed GPIIb / IIIa ) is transformed from its resting low - af ﬁ nity state to a high - af ﬁ nity receptor as the ﬁ nal step of platelet activation and subsequently mediates platelet aggregation at a molecular level ( ► Fig . 2 ) . 175 , 176 Structure α IIb β 3 belongs to the integrin family of cell adhesion mole - cules 177 – 179 and is found on platelets , megakaryocytes , mast cells , basophils , and some tumor cells . 180 – 185 With 80 , 000 to 100 , 000 copies per platelet , 186 , 187 it constitutes the major integral plasma membrane protein on human platelets accounting for 17 % of the platelet membrane protein mass . 188 Moreover , α IIb β 3 is present in platelet α - granule membranes and can become expressed following platelet activation . 189 , 190 α IIb β 3 is a heterodimer consisting of an α IIb and β 3 subunit , both synthesized as single glycosylated polypeptide chains . 191 α IIb consists of 1 , 008 amino acids , 192 whereas β 3 is composed of 762 amino acids . 193 , 194 Both subunits comprise a large extracellular domain , a transmembrane segment , and a short cytoplasmic tail , 193 – 196 and are arranged on the platelet surface in a type - 1 orientation with the N - terminus residing in the extracellular region and the C - terminus within the cytosol . 197 Function Agonist - induced platelet activation triggers intracellular signaling events that converge at the cytoplasmic tails of α IIb β 3 and are then transmitted across the platelet mem - brane via inside - out signaling ultimately resulting in the transformation of the extracellular domain of α IIb β 3 into a high - af ﬁ nity receptor for ﬁ brinogen and VWF . 176 , 197 , 198 By binding divalent ﬁ brinogen or multivalent VWF , 176 , 198 activated α IIb β 3 enables platelet – platelet interactions and consequently the formation of platelet aggregates . Moreover , by binding vitronectin , ﬁ bronectin , or thrombo - spondin - 1 , 199 – 201 activated α IIb β 3 may also mediate platelet adhesion to subendothelial structures and regulate platelet aggregation . 197 The role of activated α IIb β 3 in platelet aggregation makes it a prime target for antithrombotic therapy ( ► Fig . 2 ) . Indeed , antibodies , peptides , and nonpeptides binding to α IIb β 3 have been shown to effectively block α IIb β 3 - mediated platelet – plateletbridging , and three GPIIb / IIIa receptor antagonists are currently approved to prevent and treat detrimental platelet aggregation in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions . 202 , 203 Platelet Activation Pathways Human platelets can be activated by numerous agonists via different pathways . 204 Besides the above - discussed processes of VWF - and collagen - induced platelet activation , in particu - lar , thrombin and ADP play major roles in human platelet activation ( ► Fig . 2 ) . Thrombin The serine protease thrombin is the most potent platelet agonist and activates platelets via protease - activated recep - tors ( PARs ) and GPIb - IX - V . 205 – 209 The four PARs belong to the superfamily of G - protein - coupled receptors with seven transmembrane - spanning α - helices , four extracellular loops and domains , and four intracellular loops and domains . 210 PAR - 1 and PAR - 4 mediate most of the platelet response to thrombin on human platelets , 205 , 211 whereas PAR - 2 is not expressed on platelets and PAR - 3 functions only as a cofactor for thrombin activation of PAR - 4 . 212 While PAR - 1 is sensitive to low levels of thrombin , PAR - 4 triggers platelet activation and aggregation only at high thrombin concentrations , and cleavage of PAR - 4 by thrombin occurs 20 - to 70 - fold slower than cleavage of PAR - 1 . 213 Moreover , anti - PAR - 1 blocking antibodies and PAR - 1 antagonists blocked the activation of platelets by low concentrations of thrombin , whereas anti - PAR - 4 blocking antibodies did not affect thrombin - inducible platelet activation . 211 Therefore , PAR - 1 is the most important receptor for the activation of human platelets by thrombin . In 2014 , the ﬁ rst PAR - 1 receptor antagonist ( ► Fig . 2 ) was approved for clinical use in patients with a history of myocardial infarction or peripheral arterialdisease toprevent thrombotic cardiovascular events based on the results of two large clinical trials . 214 , 215 Adenosine Diphosphate ADP is one of the major components of the releasate from activated platelets , and its critical role in the process of platelet activation and aggregationwas recognized morethan 50 years ago . 216 Itactsasanagonistat two platelet purinergicG - protein coupled receptors — the Gq - coupled P2Y 1 and the Gi - coupled P2Y 12 receptor . Like other P2Y receptors , P2Y 1 and P2Y 12 are seven - membrane - spanning proteins with a carboxyl terminal domain on the cytoplasmic side and an amino terminal domain being exposed to the extracellular environment . 217 P2Y 1 activation initiates ADP - induced platelet aggregation and is responsible for platelet shape change . 218 However , without Seminars in Thrombosis & Hemostasis Vol . 42 No . 3 / 2016 Platelet Physiology Gremmel et al . 198 T h i s do c u m en t w a s do w n l oaded f o r pe r s ona l u s e on l y .

P2Y 12 stimulation results in ampli ﬁ cation and stabilization of the aggregation response . There is a complex interplay between P2Y 1 and P2Y 12 , 219 and coactivation of both is necessary for full platelet aggregation . 220 Due to its prominent role in platelet aggregation , the P2Y 12 receptor has become a major target of antiplatelet therapy ( ► Fig . 2 ) , 68 , 221 , 222 and the prescription of a P2Y 12 receptor antagonist in addition to aspirin is the current standard of care in patients with acute coronary syndromes and in those undergoing percutaneous cardiovascular interventions with stent implantation . 223 – 225 In contrast , no antagonists of the P2Y 1 receptor have been approved for clinical use . Conclusion New imaging techniques as well as in vitro and in vivo studies have resulted in a comprehensive view of platelet structure , secretion , adhesion , and activation , thereby providing the foundation of today ’ s understanding of the role of platelets in health and disease . Nevertheless , there still remain numerous knowledge gaps with regard to platelet physiology and pathophysiology , which offer promising targets for further investigations . Most important , evolving knowledge on pla - telets needs to be integrated in future research efforts with the ultimate goal of improving patient care . References 1 Michelson AD .
