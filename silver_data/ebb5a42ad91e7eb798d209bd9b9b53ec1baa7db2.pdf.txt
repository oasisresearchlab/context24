Extending previous modeling of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in schools in France , we estimate that at high incidence rates reactive screening protocols ( as currently applied in France ) require comparable test resources as weekly screening ( as currently applied in some Swiss cantons ) , for considerably lower control . Our findings can be used to define incidence levels triggering school protocols and optimizing their cost - effectiveness . .

School protocols are put under stress by requiring repeated quarantines or leading to large and sudden testing demand for children , overloading saturated surveillance systems 2 , 3 . Through modelling , here we compare school protocols in terms of resource peak demands , infection prevention , and reduction of schooldays lost , specifically under the high incidence conditions due to the Omicron variant . Modelling SARS - CoV transmission in schools and school protocols We extended a stochastic agent - based model of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission at school presented in detail by Colosi et al . 4 ( see Supplementary Information , SI ) . Infection progression includes prodromic , clinical and subclinical disease stages , informed from empirical distributions , and accounted for children’s lower susceptibility and transmissibility 5 , 6 . Next to symptomatic testing , we simulated the reactive protocol currently applied in France , requesting an anterior nasal LFD test at days D0 , D2 , and D4 to the class of the detected case 7 . We compared it to two regular screening strategies , with weekly ( as in the Baselland canton , Switzerland 8 ) and semiweekly frequencies , assuming 75 % ( 50 - 100 % ) adherence . Finally , we considered the reactive class quarantine after case detection , currently applied in Italian pre - primary schools 9 . Case isolation lasted 7 days . The model was informed with time - varying and age - dependent test sensitivity , yielding estimated 67 % peak sensitivity for asymptomatic children in nasal LFD tests and 96 % in salivary PCR tests 10 ( SI ) . We also explored a lower peak sensitivity of 55 % . Omicron epidemiological scenarios and test needs We considered the circulation of the Omicron variant , assuming 20 % protection from infection from prior variants 11 , an intrinsic transmissibility advantage of 30 % - 80 % relative to Delta 12 , and a shorter incubation period 12 , 13 . The advantage is applied to the within - school transmissibility of previously circulating variants that we inferred in prior work from observed prevalence in French schools 4 ( SI ) . Following current vaccine coverage in France , we considered that all teachers completed the primary vaccination ( with estimated vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease from Omicron infection VE = 50 % at 3 months after the second dose 14 ) , with 50 % of them having received the booster ( VE = 70 % within the first 4 weeks 14 ) . In a first analysis , we assumed no vaccinated children ( French coverage < 3 % by mid - January 15 ) . The simulated Omicron wave captures the dynamics reported by community surveillance incidence in primary school students 15 ( Figure 1A ) . The reactive protocol marginally reduces the peak , whereas regular screening flattens more substantially the curve . The number of tests required by the reactive protocol increases along the wave , with a predicted peak demand of 0 . 45 ( 95 % bootstrap CI 0 . 44 - 0 . 48 ) tests per student per week at an incidence close to 7 , 000 cases per 100 , 000 ( Figure 1C ) . Test demand instead decreases in the regular protocols because fewer students are present in class after the peak of infections due to isolation ( 0 . 457 ( 0 . 457 - 0 . 461 ) tests in the weekly and 0 . 97 ( 0 . 97 - 0 . 98 ) in the semiweekly screening ) . Higher incidence conditions can lead to a larger demand of tests by the reactive protocol compared to the weekly screening ( Figure 1BD ) . .

Incidence and number of tests per student over time under different school protocols .

The left plot also shows the reported incidence in the 6 - 10y age class in France in the period 02 - 18 / 01 / 2022 15 . C , D : average number of tests per student over time for reactive and regular protocols under the epidemic conditions illustrated in the top panels . The horizontal dashed lines indicate the theoretical values of the demands in number of tests per student in the weekly and semiweekly screening ( i . e . imposed by 75 % adherence and by the frequency ) . Results are obtained considering the use of nasal LFD tests in both reactive and regular screenings . Shaded areas around the curves correspond to 95 % bootstrap confidence intervals . Resource needs vs . impact on cases and schooldays lost To evaluate how to best use resources , we extended the analysis of Figure 1 to a larger set of Omicron wave scenarios with varying peak incidence ( SI ) . For increasing values of the incidence rate , from approximately 4 , 000 to 10 , 000 cases per 100 , 000 , the number of reactive tests per student - week increases from 0 . 25 to 0 . 61 ( Figure 2A ) . However , these tests would have marginal control of the viral circulation at school , reducing the peak of the wave by < 10 % ( Figure 2B ) . For incidence up to 7 , 100 cases per 100 , 000 in absence of interventions , weekly screening would lower the peak by > 20 % while requiring < 0 . 46 tests per student - week at peak ( Figure 2AB ) . The same impact could be achieved even for higher incidence rates ( < 10 , 100 cases per 100 , 000 ) by doubling the frequency . Similar results are obtained considering the reduction of the epidemic size of the full wave ( SI ) . Student - days lost remain below 11 % with reactive and weekly screening , whereas reactively closing the class could lead to > 20 % of absence per student , compatible with observations 3 ( Figure 2C ) . Findings are robust against changes in booster coverage in teachers , in Omicron transmissibility and incubation period ( SI ) . Higher detection rates would penalize the reactive screening , due to an increase in test demand while control remains limited ( SI ) . .

C : Peak percentage of student - days lost as a function of the percentage of peak reduction achieved by each protocol ; both quantities are computed with respect to symptomatic testing .

In panels B and C : incidence values in the legend refer to peak incidence of symptomatic testing ( i . e . in absence of interventions ) ; the corresponding values for each protocol are plotted in panel A ; arrows are shown as guide to the eye . Impact of test type , adherence , vaccination of children Changing from nasal LFD tests to salivary PCR tests would improve the reactive strategy from 9 % to 14 % peak reduction if results are available after 12h ( Figure 3A ) . Regular testing is instead mainly affected by adherence ( Figure 3B ) . Vaccinating children would provide a collective benefit in reducing viral circulation at school . Assuming the vaccine effectiveness estimate for adults after 2 Pfizer doses ( VE = 60 % ) 14 , the peak would be reduced by 30 % - 45 % for 40 % to 60 % coverage with the reactive screening , and by 35 % - 50 % with weekly screening , compared to no vaccination ( Figure 3C ) . For VE = 20 % , accounting for waning 14 , the reductions would be in the range 19 - 28 % and 22 - 33 % with the reactive and weekly screening , respectively . Figure 3 .

Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease is set to VE = 60 % ( solid bars ) , assuming the estimate of two Pfizer vaccine doses against Omicron obtained in adults 14 , and VE = 20 % ( transparent bars ) , corresponding to the waned effectiveness estimated 3 - 4 months after the second dose 14 . Results of all panels refer to the Omicron wave shown in Figure 1A . Discussion Given the high incidence rates currently recorded in Europe due to the Omicron variant 1 , our study shows that reactive screening strategies in schools , as employed in France , would require a similar number of tests per student per week compared to weekly screening , but achieve a lower epidemic control . The protocol requesting three tests in less than a week for case contacts in French primary schools led to large disruption in January 2022 , in terms of logistics , resources , and impact on surveillance capacity 2 . We estimate that the same resources would be more efficiently used by weekly screening schools , reaching 20 - 40 % peak reduction for incidence rates up to the values currently registered in France 15 , compared to the marginal reduction ( < 10 % ) of reactive screening . Other countries opted for systematically screening schools against SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , supported by numerical evidence 4 , 16 – 19 . Authorities in Baselland ( Switzerland ) offered weekly salivary PCR tests to all schools since March 2021 . Prior to making participation mandatory in 2022 , recorded adherence was on average > 75 % 8 . Proactively screening also has the advantage of planning resources in advance , contrary to reactive screening subject to sudden peak demands and potential shortages . This was reported to help simplifying the logistics of test - to - stay strategies in pilot weekly screenings implemented in a number of pre - primary and primary schools in the Auvergne - Rhône - Alpes region in France . Preliminary unpublished empirical estimates from these screenings also suggest a reduction of cases in December 2021 compared to the reactive strategy , in line with model predictions . The now widespread use of nasal antigenic tests makes repeated self - testing possible without loss in efficiency , as lower sensitivity is compensated by promptness of results and high frequency . It would also limit the high rates of absence from school due to reactive class closures that are predicted by the model and currently reported 3 . As European countries approach the peak of the Omicron wave , these findings can be used to tune the response by defining incidence levels triggering protocols adapting to the decreasing phase of the wave , according to the established objectives . Systematically screening schools remains the optimal test - to - stay strategy , reducing peak incidence rates in children , and thus their consequences on hospitalizations and long COVID 20 , while limiting school disruption and resources . Large vaccination coverage in children contributes to mitigate high viral circulation , making schools safer . Current coverage remains however low in children in several European countries ( 14 % median coverage for first dose vaccination by week 4 2022 ; SI ) . Our study has limitations . We did not fit the model to the Omicron wave in a specific country , as we aimed to evaluate protocols’ resources and impact in a range of high incidence conditions experienced across countries in Europe . Nonetheless , the model follows the observed dynamics in France . With remaining uncertainty on Omicron features , we assumed that its higher spreading rate was mainly due to immune evasion 12 , in line with observations from household studies 21 . Considering a higher intrinsic transmission led to similar conclusions . We did not consider immunity waning over time , but tested waned vaccine effectiveness . A large demand in tests results from reactively screening schools in high incidence conditions . Comparable resources could be more efficiently used in a proactive screening strategy to mitigate the peak . Acknowledgments We thank Thomas Bénet for useful discussions .
