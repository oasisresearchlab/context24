We conducted genome - wide association studies ( GWAS ) to identify susceptibility loci for glomerular ﬁltration rate , estimated by serum creatinine ( eGFRcrea ) and cystatin C ( eGFRcys ) , and CKD ( eGFRcrea o 60 ml / min / 1 . 73 m 2 ) in European - ancestry participants of four population - based cohorts ( ARIC , CHS , FHS , RS ; n ¼ 19 , 877 ; 2 , 388 CKD cases ) , and tested for replication in 21 , 466 participants ( 1 , 932 CKD cases ) . We identiﬁed signiﬁcant SNP associations ( P o 5 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 8 ) with CKD at the UMOD locus , with eGFRcrea at UMOD , SHROOM3 and GATM - SPATA5L1 , and with eGFRcys at CST and STC1 . UMOD encodes the most common protein in human urine , Tamm - Horsfall protein 2 , and rare mutations in UMOD cause mendelian forms of kidney disease 3 . Our ﬁndings provide new insights into CKD pathogenesis and underscore the importance of common genetic variants inﬂuencing renal function and disease . CKD affects 10 – 13 % of US adults 4 . Estimates from Europe are similar 5 , and incidence and prevalence are increasing worldwide . Its most severe form , end - stage renal disease requires dialysis and currently affects over 500 , 000 US adults 6 . In addition to conferring risk for end - stage renal disease , CKD increases the risk of cardio - vascular disease 7 and all - cause mortality 8 . Multiple studies such as familial aggregation studies have provided evidence for a genetic component to kidney disease . Heritability estimates of eGFRcrea , the most commonly used measure of kidney function , are reported between 0 . 41 and 0 . 75 in individuals with the major CKD risk factors hypertension or diabetes 9 , 10 , and as 0 . 33 in a population - based sample 11 . Heritability estimates of GFRcys are similar . Although rare genetic variants causing different forms of monogenetic kidney disease have been identiﬁed , common CKD susceptibility variants have been difﬁcult to detect reproducibly by linkage or candidate gene studies 12 . To discover such variants , we conducted meta - analyses of study - speciﬁc GWAS for indices of renal function ( eGFRcrea and eGFRcys ) and for CKD from four population - based , unselected cohorts of the CHARGE Consortium 13 : Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Received 27 January ; accepted 3 April ; published online 10 May 2009 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / ng . 377 1 Department of Epidemiology , Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , Maryland , USA . 2 Cardiovascular Health Research Unit and Department of Medicine , University of Washington , Seattle , Washington , USA . 3 Department of Epidemiology , Erasmus Medical Center , Rotterdam , The Netherlands . 4 National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute Framingham Heart Study and the Center for Population Studies , Framingham , Massachusetts , USA . 5 Department of Biostatistics , University of Washington , Seattle , Washington , USA . 6 Department of Biostatistics , Boston University , Boston , Massachusetts , USA . 7 Icelandic Heart Association Research Institute , Kopavogur , Iceland . 8 University of Iceland , Reykjavik , Iceland . 9 Laboratory of Epidemiology , Demography , and Biometry , Intramural Research Program , National Institute on Aging , Bethesda , Maryland , USA . 10 McKusick - Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine , Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions , Baltimore , Maryland , USA . 11 Human Genetics Center and Division of Epidemiology , University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston , Houston , Texas , USA . 12 Division of Cardiology , Geneva University Hospital , Switzerland . 13 Department of Biostatistics , Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , Maryland , USA . 14 Medical Genetics Institute , Cedars - Sinai Medical Center , Los Angeles , California , USA . 15 Division of Nephrology , Department of Medicine , University of Washington , Seattle , Washington , USA . 16 Tufts - New England Medical Center , Boston , Massachusetts , USA . 17 Departments of Medicine and Epidemiology , Cardiovascular Health Research Unit , University of Washington , Seattle , Washington , USA . 18 Boston University Schools of Medicine and Public Health , Boston , Massachusetts , USA . 19 Renal Section , Boston Medical Center and Boston University School of Medicine , Boston , Massachusetts , USA . 20 Department of Internal Medicine , Erasmus Medical Center , Rotterdam , The Netherlands . 21 Division of Preventive Medicine , Brigham and Women’s Hospital , Boston , Massachusetts , USA . 22 General Internal Medicine Division , San Francisco VA Medical Center , University of California , San Francisco , California , USA . 23 Brigham and Women’s Hospital Division of Endocrinology and Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts , USA . 24 Member of the Netherlands Consortium on Healthy Aging ( NCHA ) . 25 These authors contributed equally to this work . 26 These authors jointly directed the project .

As a direct measure - ment of kidney function is not feasible in population - based studies , we applied commonly used estimating equations to determine eGFR - crea 14 and eGFRcys 15 . Population - based measures of GFR are imper - fect 16 , and using two different biomarkers to estimate GFR can therefore help to uncover true signals . CKD was deﬁned as eGFRcrea o 60 ml / min / 1 . 73 m 2 according to US national guidelines 17 , as detailed in the Methods . Genotypes for 4 2 . 5 million SNPs were imputed within each study using reference genotype data from the HapMap CEU population . Study - speciﬁc details on genotyping and imputation are provided in Supplementary Table 1 online . SNPs showing evidence of suggestive ( P o 4 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 7 ) or signiﬁcant ( P o 5 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 8 ) genome - wide association were tested for in silico replication in independent study samples : the Age Gene / Environment Suscept - ibility - Reykjavik Study ( AGES ) and the Women’s Genome Health Study ( WGHS ) . Detailed information on the study samples is pro - vided in Supplementary Methods online . Characteristics of the four discovery and two validation study samples are shown in Table 1 ; 19 , 877 participants with 2 , 388 CKD cases and 21 , 466 participants with 1 , 932 CKD cases contributed information , respectively . CKD prevalence was higher in cohorts with older partici - pants , ranging from 6 . 3 % ( WGHS ) to 24 . 3 % ( AGES ) . Characteristics among CKD cases are provided in Supplementary Table 2 online . Figure 1 summarizes meta - analysis results for CKD , eGFRcrea and eGFRcys across the discovery samples . The observed versus expected P - value distributions ( quantile - quantile plots ) are shown in Supplemen - tary Figure 1 online : study - speciﬁc genomic inﬂation factors did not indicate substantial inﬂation of the test statistics for any of the traits . Table 2 lists the most signiﬁcant SNP at each genomic locus associated with CKD , eGFRcrea and eGFRcys , and replication results . Study - speciﬁc results are presented in Supplementary Table 3 online . For CKD , we identiﬁed SNP rs12917707 in a highly evolutionary conserved region 3 . 6 kb upstream of the UMOD ( uromodulin ) gene on chromosome 16 ( P ¼ 5 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 16 across discovery and replication samples ; Fig . 2 and Table 2 ) . Seven SNPs in or upstream of UMOD in high LD ( r 2 4 0 . 8 ) with rs12917707 were also associated with CKD at a genome - wide signiﬁcant level . The minor T allele at rs12917707 was associated with 20 % reduced risk of CKD ( meta - analysis OR ¼ 0 . 80 , P ¼ 2 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 12 ; Table 2 ) .

Findings were consistent in models adjusting for major CKD risk factors including systolic blood pressure , hypertension medication intake and diabetes mellitus , as well as stratiﬁed for age , sex , hypertension and diabetes status ( Fig . 3 ) . Prospective information from the ARIC Study demon - strated that the T allele of rs12917707 was associated with a lower relative hazard of incident CKD ( HR 0 . 81 , 95 % CI ¼ 0 . 72 – 0 . 92 , P ¼ 0 . 001 ) over 14 . 7 years of follow - up ( n ¼ 952 cases ; see Methods ) . Rare UMOD mutations cause autosomal dominant forms of kidney disease , medullary cystic kidney disease type 2 ( MCKD2 ) , familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy ( FJHN ) , and glome - rulocystic kidney disease ( GCKD ) ( MIM603860 , MIM162000 , MIM609886 ) 3 , 18 , 19 . As the syndromes caused by rare UMOD muta - tions are often accompanied by hyperuricemia and gout , we explored the association of rs12917707 with these traits ; no signiﬁcant associa - tions were observed . Although this does not exclude the presence of rare UMOD variants among our study participants , our study identiﬁes another example of a genomic risk locus containing suscept - ibility variants across the spectrum of risk allele frequencies . One study of Umod knockout mice reported 63 % lower creati - nine clearance in knockout compared to wild - type mice 20 . UMOD encodes the most abundant protein in the urine of healthy individuals , Tamm - Horsfall protein . The physiological functions of Tamm - Horsfall protein are not well understood but may include protection against inﬂammation and infection 2 . A possible role for UMOD in renal development was also recently reported 21 . UMOD is transcribed exclusively in renal tubular cells of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle . Our ﬁndings therefore suggest a common mechanism for CKD pathogenesis localized to the nephron’s loop of Henle , which has previously received little attention . The major risk factors for kidney disease , hypertension and diabetes , are thought to affect the glomerulus primarily , and glomerular damage is typically characterized by albuminuria . Our ﬁndings , however , indicate that the association is consistent across strata of hypertension and diabetes , and we observed no association with albuminuria . Thus , our ﬁndings provide new insights into CKD pathogenesis and highlight the need to understand the production and functions of Tamm - Horsfall protein within the kidney . The broad CKD deﬁnition we chose , including a variety of causes of CKD such as hypertension and diabetes , indicates that the search for susceptibility variants for complex diseases may not only beneﬁt from a narrower deﬁnition of the phenotype , but also from evaluation of a broad phenotype deﬁnition in order to identify common disease mechanisms . Four loci were identiﬁed in association with eGFRcrea : the strongest association was for SNP rs12917707 at the UMOD locus ( P overall ¼ 5 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 16 ; Table 2 ) . The most signiﬁcant SNP at the second signiﬁcant eGFRcrea locus was the intronic SNP rs17319721 located in a highly evolutionary conserved region in SHROOM3 ( shroom family member 3 ) on chromosome 4 ( P overall ¼ 1 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 12 ; Fig . 2b and Table 2 ) . The SHROOM3 gene product is expressed in human kidney and is reported to have a role in epithelial cell shape regulation 22 . The association at the third eGFRcrea locus , the intronic SNP rs6040055 in JAG1 ( jagged 1 ) on chromosome 20 ( P ¼ 1 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 8 ; Table 2 and Supplementary Fig . 2 online ) , did not replicate ( P overall ¼ 0 . 006 ) . The ﬁnding may therefore be a false positive , although a biological role of JAG1 in kidney disease is supported by rare JAG1 mutations causing Alagille syndrome ( MIM118450 ) 23 . Lastly , the intronic SNP rs2467853 in SPATA5L1 ( spermatogenesis associated 5 - like 1 ) at the GATM - SPATA5L1 locus on chromosome 15 was signiﬁcantly associated with eGFRcrea ( P overall ¼ 6 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 14 ; Fig . 2c and Table 2 ) . GATM encodes glycine amidinotransferase , an enzyme involved in creatine biosynth - esis . SNPs at this locus are therefore likely related to serum levels of creatinine without inﬂuencing susceptibility to kidney disease 2 . 0 1 . 0 O dd s o f C K D pe r r s 12917707 [ T ] a ll e l e 0 . 5 Overall 55 – 65 y F e m a l e M a l e N o Y e s N o Y e s ≥ 65 y Age Sex Hyper - tension Diabetes Figure 3 Meta - analysis of the odds of CKD per each additional copy of the minor T allele at UMOD rs12917707 across strata of major kidney disease risk factors .

A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . ( Table 3 ) . Although rs2467853 is located in SPATA5L1 , strong LD extends into the region of the GATM gene . We identiﬁed three loci in association with eGFRcys : the strongest association was for the intergenic SNP rs13038305 between CST3 ( cystatin C ) and CST9 ( cystatin 9 ) ( P ¼ 2 . 2 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 88 ; Fig . 2d and Table 2 ) . SNPs within the cystatin ( CST ) superfamily gene cluster on chromosome 20 have been previously reported as associated with serum cystatin C levels 24 . The genes in the CST superfamily encode cystatin proteins . SNPs in these genes likely inﬂuence serum levels of cystatin C and therefore estimated eGFRcys , but not true GFR or CKD susceptibility ( Table 3 ) . Second , we identiﬁed the intergenic SNP rs1731274 , located 54 kb from the STC1 ( stanniocalcin 1 ) gene on chromosome 8 ( P ¼ 4 . 6 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 8 ; Fig . 2e and Table 2 ) . STC1 encodes stanniocalcin 1 , a hormone regulating calcium homeostasis in ﬁsh . In mammals , it is highly expressed in the renal nephron and may inﬂuence local calcium and phosphate homeostasis through a para - crine mechanism 25 . A recent study in STC1 transgenic mice reported STC1 as a renal protective protein with a potent anti - inﬂammatory role 26 . As the repli - cation samples did not have cystatin C mea - surements available , we explored the association of rs1731274 with eGFRcrea across the discovery and replication samples ( P ¼ 2 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 7 , Table 2 ) . Finally , rs12917707 at the UMOD locus was associated with eGFRcys at P ¼ 2 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 7 . Table 3 presents the association of all genome - wide signiﬁcant SNPs across the three renal traits . SNPs in UMOD , SHROOM3 and STC1 showed direction - consistent asso - ciation across traits . For example , rs12917707 at UMOD was associated with both higher eGFRcrea and eGFRcys representing better kidney function , and with lower odds of CKD , conferring disease protection . SNPs at the GATM - SPATA5L1 and CST regions were only associated with the respective discovery trait ; the association of rs2467853 at the GATM - SPATA5L1 locus with CKD likely results from the eGFRcrea - based deﬁnition of CKD . All SNPs associated with CKD , eGFRcrea and eGFRcys at P o 4 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 7 are listed in Supplementary Tables 4 , 5 and 6 online , respectively . Together , loci for eGFRcrea explain 0 . 7 % of the eGFRcrea variance ( 0 . 43 % without the GATM locus ) , and loci for eGFRcys explain 3 . 2 % of the eGFRcys variance ( 0 . 24 % without the CST locus ) , suggesting that additional yet - undiscovered genetic variants inﬂuence variability in renal function . In accordance with small absolute differences observed in other GWAS for continuous human traits , the multi - variable adjusted eGFR difference across genotypes for any one locus was small . As risk alleles may act in an additive fashion , we created a risk score for each individual as the sum of risk alleles at UMOD , SHROOM3 and STC1 .

CKD prevalence ranged from 0 % in those without any risk alleles to 12 . 1 % in individuals carrying all six risk alleles . In summary , we have identiﬁed and validated common variants at several previously unknown loci conferring susceptibility for kidney dysfunction and CKD in large , unselected population - based studies . Studies to understand the production and functions of Tamm - Horsfall protein are warranted and may eventually lead to novel prevention and intervention options to reduce CKD risk . METHODS Study samples . Four large , population - based cohorts of the CHARGE consortium had GWAS data available and formed the discovery sample : ARIC , CHS , FHS and RS . Detailed information about these cohorts , including the design papers , is provided in the Supplementary Methods . Brieﬂy , the studies were initiated to study cardiovascular disease and its risk factors and diseases related to aging . The population - based ARIC cohort recruited 15 , 792 middle - aged participants from 1987 – 1989 in four US communities . The population - based CHS cohort recruited 5 , 888 participants aged 65 years and older from 1989 – 1990 and 1992 – 1993 in four US communities . The FHS is a community - based study with a family component , including the Original ( n ¼ 5 , 209 , recruited 1948 ) and Offspring ( n ¼ 5 , 214 , recruited 1971 ) components . The community - based RS recruited 7 , 983 participants aged 55 years or older from 1990 – 1993 . Two independent study samples were used to replicate results . In AGES , 5 , 764 survivors of the Reykjavik Study were examined from 2002 to 2006 and contributed to information . The WGHS is a sample drawn in 2006 from the original Women’s Health Study . Each participant provided written informed consent , and institutional review boards of the participating institutions approved the study protocols . African - American participants from ARIC and CHS did not contribute information to the present study . Genotyping and imputation . Detailed information about genotyping and imputation methods is provided in Supplementary Table 1 , and details about data cleaning are provided in the Supplementary Methods . Brieﬂy , all studies directly genotyped between 300 , 000 and 900 , 000 SNPs using whole - genome genotyping arrays by either Affymetrix ( 6 . 0 , ARIC ; 500K and 50K gene - centric , FHS ) or Illumina ( Human CNV370 , AGES and CHS ; 550K , RS ; Human - Hap300 Duo - Plus or a combination of HumanHap300 and iSelect , WGHS ) . All genotyping was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions between 2006 – 2008 . Using the Phase II CEU HapMap individuals as a reference panel , genotypes were imputed to a common set of B 2 . 5 million high - quality HapMap SNPs . Software used for imputation were BimBam v0 . 99 ( ref . 27 , CHS ) and MACH v1 . 0 . 15 / 16 ( all others , see MACH URL below ) ; FHS accounted for relatedness of participants . Imputed genotypes were expressed as an allelic dosage , a fractional value between 0 and 2 . The WGHS did not impute genotypes . eGFRcrea , eGFRcys and CKD . Serum creatinine was measured using a modiﬁed kinetic Jaffe reaction in all studies but AGES , where an enzymatic method was used . eGFRcrea was calculated using the Modiﬁcation of Diet in Renal Disease ( MDRD ) Study equation 14 : eGFRcrea ( ml / min / 1 . 73 m 2 ) ¼ 186 . 3 (cid:1) serum creatinine ( mg / dl ) (cid:2) 1 . 154 (cid:1) age (cid:2) 0 . 203 (cid:1) 0 . 742 ( if female ) . To be comparable across studies , creatinine values in all studies were calibrated using regression to age - and sex - adjusted mean values from a nationally representa - tive US survey as described previously 28 . Cystatin C was measured by a particle - enhanced immunonephelometric assay ( N Latex Cystatin C , Dade Behring ) at ARIC visit 4 , CHS baseline exam , and FHS offspring exam 7 with a nephelometer ( BNII , Dade - Behring ) . eGFRcys was then calculated using the formula eGFRcys ¼ 76 . 7 (cid:1) ( serum cystatin C ) (cid:2) 1 . 19 ( ref . 15 ) . CKD was deﬁned as eGFRcrea o 60 ml / min / 1 . 73 m 2 according to National Kidney Foundation guidelines 17 . CKD in CHS , RS , WGHS and AGES was deﬁned on the basis of a single measurement of serum creatinine at the baseline visit . FHS and ARIC used a cumulative deﬁnition of CKD based on serum creatinine measurements at several study visits as detailed in the Supplementary Methods . Incident CKD in ARIC was deﬁned as eGFRcrea o 60 ml / min / 1 . 73 m 2 at study visits 2 or 4 in individuals with eGFRcrea Z 60 ml / min / 1 . 73 m 2 at study visit 1 , or a kidney - disease speciﬁc ICD code on a hospital discharge record or death certiﬁcate from study inception in 1987 through January 1 , 2005 ( ref . 29 ) . Information on age and sex was collected at each study visit , and ancestry was self - reported . Potential population stratiﬁcation was assessed as detailed in the Supplementary Methods . Statistical analysis . GWAS was conducted within each cohort for eGFRcrea , eGFRcys and CKD , followed by meta - analysis of the study - speciﬁc associations for each trait . SNPs showing genome - wide signiﬁcant association with any of the three traits in meta - analyses were then explored for their association with the other two traits . The phenotype for the eGFR analyses in all studies was created by calculating a natural logarithmic transformation of eGFR obtained from the respective equations for eGFRcrea and eGFRcys . All studies but CHS then created sex - speciﬁc age - and study - site ( ARIC ) or cohort ( FHS ) adjusted residuals . CHS adjusted for age , sex and study site in multivariable regression models . Incident CKD in ARIC was analyzed using multivariable - adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression . Software packages used by the individual studies to conduct linear and logistic regression are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . FHS accounted for the relatedness of individuals in the analyses as detailed in the Supplementary Methods . Pedigree correlations were adjusted using the robust variance option . All studies used an additive genetic model . Meta - analysis was conducted using inverse - variance weighting as imple - mented in METAL ( see URLs section below ) . Prior to meta - analysis , the genomic control parameter was calculated within each study for each trait to assess potential inﬂation of the test statistics . If the parameter was larger than 1 , an adjustment was carried out . Only SNPs with minor allele frequency ( MAF ) Z 2 % were analyzed based on the number of CKD cases , corresponding to approximately 50 carriers of the minor allele with CKD . Statistical hetero - geneity was evaluated using Cochrane’s w 2 test ( Q - test ) . The most signiﬁcant SNPs at genomic loci with evidence of suggestive association ( P o 4 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 7 ) for any of the traits were tested for replication in the independent samples . This threshold corresponds to 1 / 2 . 5 million tests conducted and corresponds to one or less expected false - positive ﬁndings 30 . A threshold of P o 5 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 8 was used to indicate genome - wide signiﬁcance , corresponding to a Bonferroni correction for the estimated 1 million common independent SNPs across the genome ( 0 . 05 / 1 million ) . The SNAP program with the HapMap CEU sample as a reference was used to identify the best proxy in the WGHS dataset , to evaluate LD to nearby coding SNPs , and to evaluate LD between imputed SNPs and proxy SNPs that were directly genotyped .
