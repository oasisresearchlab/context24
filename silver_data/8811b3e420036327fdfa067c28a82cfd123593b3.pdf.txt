Because the formation of these sub - cellular structures is complex and relatively poorly understood , we evaluated the role of the adapter protein SH3PXD2B [ HOFI , fad49 , Tks4 ] , which plays a role in the development of the eye , skeleton and adipose tissue . Surprisingly , we find that SH3PXD2B is requisite for the development of EGF - induced membrane ruffles and lamellipodia , as well as for efficient cellular attachment and spreading of HeLa cells . Furthermore , SH3PXD2B is present in a complex with the non - receptor protein tyrosine kinase Src , phosphorylated by Src , which is consistent with SH3PXD2B accumulating in Src - induced podosomes . Furthermore , SH3PXD2B closely follows the subcellular relocalization of cortactin to Src - induced podosomes , EGF - induced membrane ruffles and lamellipodia . Because SH3PXD2B also forms a complex with the C - terminal region of cortactin , we propose that SH3PXD2B is a scaffold protein that plays a key role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton via Src and cortactin .

Introduction Molecular scaffolds are crossroads where parallel signal transduc - tion pathways of vital cellular functions including cellular attachment or migration are integrated [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . Scaffold proteins usually consist of multiple domains that can serve independently or cooperatively as docking sites to recruit the appropriate set of proteins in a temporally and spatially ordered fashion . The Pleckstrin homology ( PH ) and Phox homology ( PX ) domains bind different phosphoinositides and are believed to be responsible for anchoring adaptor proteins to various microdomains of the cell membrane [ 4 ] . PX - domains are frequently found in combination with Src - homology3 ( SH3 ) domains that bind to proline - rich sequences . Although the molecular details of interaction between PX - domain and phospoinositides are well - mapped , the complexity of the in vivo functions of this PX / SH3 protein module is not well understood . Recently , a distinct member of PX / SH3 protein family , FISH / Tks5 , comprised of FIve SH3 domains and an N - terminal PX - domain [ 5 ] , has emerged as a central player of the protein scaffold regulating podosome formation in Src - transformed fibroblast cells [ 6 ] . FISH appears to be requisite for the organization of podosomes [ 7 ] , actin - rich structures which are implicated in the invasion of tumor cells as well as in the migration of macrophages or dendritic cells within tissues [ 8 ] . In addition to podosomes , there are other organelles that control motility and invasion . Lamellipodia and filopodia form at the leading edge of the migrating cell generated by actin polymerization at the barbed end of the growing filaments [ 9 , 10 ] . Lamellipodia are shallow protruding structures comprised of a dense array of branched actin filaments , while filopodia are rod - like protrusions built from a bundle of actin filaments [ 11 , 12 , 13 ] . Lamellipodia and podosomes are enriched in cortactin PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 August 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 8 | e23653 [ 14 , 15 ] , a scaffold protein that is a substrate for Src [ 15 ] . Cortactin has been shown to enhance cell migration in transwell systems , as well as in wound healing assays [ 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 ] . Moreover , migration , generation of persistent lamellipodia , invadopodia and efficient cell spreading can be inhibited by siRNAs targeting cortactin [ 20 , 21 ] . However , experiments with cortactin null murine fibroblasts showed an impairment only in growth factor induced actin cytoskeleton reorganization and migration , but not in generation of lamellipodia [ 22 ] . Nevertheless , overexpression of cortactin in multiple types of human tumors e . g . in gastric , liver and breast cancer suggests that cortactin is a key regulator of these processes in vivo [ 23 , 24 , 25 ] . Recently several groups including ours have identified a homologue of FISH / Tks5 referred to as HOFI / Tks4 / fad49 . Subsequently , another name , SH3PXD2B was also assigned to the protein that for simplicity will be used in this paper . In in vitro and ex vivo studies the murine ortologue of SH3PXD2B was shown to play an important role in the formation of functional podosomes [ 26 ] , production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) by tumor cells [ 27 , 28 ] and in the differentiation of white adipose tissue [ 29 ] . In two independent mice models , the absence of SH3PXD2B was found to profoundly impair normal development causing runted growth , craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities , hearing impairment , glaucoma and the virtual absence of white adipose tissue [ 30 , 31 ] . In humans , SH3PXD2B - deficiency is responsible for the develop - ment of Frank - Ter Haar syndrome ( MIM 249420 ) [ 30 ] . Despite its impact on development and cell physiology , the molecular machinery operated by SH3PXD2B is poorly understood . In the present study we characterize the human orthologue of SH3PXD2B and examine potential mechanisms and functions that are controlled by SH3PXD2B . We show that SH3PXD2B , upon activation by growth factors or expression of constitutively active Src , associates with dynamic assemblies of the actin cytoskeleton e . g . lamellipodia and podosomes , independent of lipid binding via its PX - domain . Furthermore , we found SH3PXD2B in a complex with two central regulators of the actin cytoskeleton ; Src and cortactin . The latter interaction required the C - terminal part and an intact SH3 - domain of cortactin . When SH3PXD2B was eliminated by RNA interference we detected a marked impairment in growth factor - induced membrane ruffling and in the generation of lamellipodia and hence , as our experiments show , SH3PXD2B plays an important role in cellular attachment and cell spreading . Results Expression of SH3PXD2B in tumor - derived cell lines and primary cells Because FISH / Tks5 appeared implicated in malignancies , we assessed SH3PXD2B expression in tumor - derived cell lines . To this end we cloned the full - length cDNA encoding human SH3PXD2B ( Genbank , DQ109556 , AAZ99795 ) and raised a polyclonal antibody directed against the N - terminal region of the protein . This antibody , which recognized the predicted protein of approximately 120 kD in a western blotting experiment ( Figure 1A ) , detected high levels of SH3PXD2B in several human tumor cell lines e . g . in HeLa , 293T , the acute B - cell leukemia line REH , the erythroleukemia cell line TF1 and the A2058 melanoma . ( Figure 1A left panel ) . As it was not found in Jurkat T cells or in the acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP1 , SH3PXD2B expression appears not essential to maintain continuous cell proliferation . Importantly , SH3PXD2B expression is not restricted to tumor - derived cell lines , as primary cells including human macrophages and human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) also expressed the protein ( Figure 1A right panel ) . Next , we examined the intracellular localization of SH3PXD2B in the tumor - derived HeLa cells or in primary cells , e . g . HUVEC and monocyte - derived macrophages . SH3PXD2B was present in or adjacent to the plasma membrane and in the perinuclear region of both transformed and primary cells ( Figure 1B – D ) . Although perinuclear staining was prominent in HeLa cells and in HUVEC , SH3PXD2B did not co - localize with either the endosomal marker transferrin receptor or the Endoplasmic Reticulum ( ER ) - specific protein disulfide - isomerase ( data not shown ) . In membrane ruffles , lamellipodia and podosomes SH3PXD2B co - localizes with cortactin Because FISH / Tks5 and SH3PXD2B were required for the generation of Src - induced podosomes [ 7 , 26 , 32 , 33 ] we reasoned that SH3PXD2B may also play a role in the generation of other dynamic membrane structures . To test this , we induced the formation of membrane ruffles and lamellipodia in serum starved HeLa cells with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) ( Figure 2A – F ) . Under resting conditions SH3PXD2B localized to the cytosol often in the perinuclear region , whilst staining of the plasma membrane appeared to be minimal ( Figure 2A ) . EGF - induced membrane ruffles and lamellipodia , however , were enriched in SH3PXD2B ( Figure 2D ) . When cortactin , a marker for cortical actin polymerization was visualized with a specific antibody , we observed intense cortactin accumulation in the EGF - induced membrane protrusions where cortactin co - localized with SH3PXD2B ( Figure 2E & 2F ) . Co - localization of SH3PXD2B with cortactin was evident in 100 % of cells that developed membrane ruffles or lamellipodia in response to EGF stimulation . To corroborate co - localization of SH3PXD2B with components of the actin cytoskeleton , we examined its potential co - localization with actin filaments in EGF - treated Cos - 7 cells . For this set of experiments , SH3PXD2B was tagged with a C - terminal V5 epitope and the construct encoding the fusion protein was transfected into Cos - 7 cells . Western blots of cell extracts derived from the transfected cells contained a single band reacting with the V5 - specific antibody . The molecular weight of the expressed V5 - fusion protein was found to be identical to that of SH3PXD2B ( Figure 2G top panel ) indicating that the protein was full - length and unprocessed . To assess the extent of over - expression the same blots were stripped and re - probed with an SH3PXD2B - specific antibody ( Figure 2G middle panel ) which labeled the same band in addition to the less prominent , endogenously expressed SH3PXD2B . Similar to endogenously expressed SH3PXD2B , the V5 - epitope tagged fusion protein localized to membrane ruffles where it co - localized with polymerized actin ( Figure 2K – M ) . Co - localization of V5 - SH3PXD2B with actin was observed in 100 % of cells that developed membrane ruffles or lamellipodia . Co - localization of endogenous SH3PXD2B with cortactin was also evident in primary cells e . g . in lamellipodia at the leading edge formed by polarized , migrating monocyte - derived macrophages ( Figure 3A – C ) or HUVECs ( Figure 3D – F ) . Because cortactin is one of the podosome markers , we also tested its co - localization with SH3PXD2B in Src - induced podo - somes . To this end , we used a modified Rat - 1 cell line , LA29ts , that carries a temperature sensitive mutant form of Src [ 34 , 35 , 36 ] . In LA29ts cells , at the nonpermissive temperature ( 39 . 5 u C ) , Src is in an inactive conformation which is rapidly converted to the active conformation when cells are cultured at the permissive temperature ( 34 . 5 u C ) . As predicted , activation of Src induces the appearance of podosomes ( Figure 3J – L . ) . Importantly , SH3PXD2B primarily localized to the cytosol in LA29ts cells SH3PXD2B Regulates Lamellipodia and Cell Spreading PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 August 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 8 | e23653 transfected with the full - length SH3PXD2B - EGFP construct when they were kept at the nonpermissive temperature , ( Figure 3G ) . By contrast , when cells were grown at the permissive temperature , as expected , SH3PXD2B localized to the forming rosettes of podosomes ( Figure 3J ) . To visualize podosomes and other membrane structures , slides were counterstained with a cortac - tin - specific antibody . Merging of the confocal images revealed co - localization of SH3PXD2B and cortactin in Src - induced podo - somes ( Figure 3L ) , which was not observed in the absence of active Src at the nonpermissive temperature ( Figure 3I ) . Co - localization between SH3PXD2B and cortactin at the permissive temperature was evident in over 95 % of the cells ( Figure 3M ) . Functional activity of cortactin - and SH3PXD2B - rich structures visually identified as podosomes were further analyzed in standard gelatin - degradation assays . As shown in Figure S1 , gelatinase activity was readily detectable at the permissive temperature suggesting that the developing podosomes were functionally active . Taken together , SH3PXD2B closely follows the pattern of cortactin’s intracellular movement into multiple actin - based membrane structures including EGF - induced membrane ruffles and lamellipodia or Src - induced podosomes , suggesting that SH3PXD2B together with cortactin may function as a general regulator of the actin cytoskeleton in various mammalian cells . SH3PXD2B associates with cortactin and Src Several key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton including SH3PXD2B , cortactin , paxillin are phosphorylated by Src . To gain further insight into SH3PXD2B function we used co - immuno - precipitation to identify SH3PXD2B - associated phos - phoproteins that are phosphorylated by Src [ 14 , 15 , 26 , 37 ] . 293T cells were transiently transfected with the construct encoding a C - terminal V5 - tagged full - length SH3PXD2B protein alone or in combination with a construct expressing Src ( Figure 4A ) . Transfected cells were lysed 48 hours after transfection and V5 - SH3PXD2B was immunoprecipitated with a V5 - specific antibody . Western blotting with a phosphotyrosine - specific antibody re - vealed three dominant bands with molecular weights of 120 kD , 80 kD and 60 kD ( Figure 4A top panel ) . Phosphorylation requires at least a transient interaction between the kinase and its substrate ; thus , we tested whether SH3PXD2B and Src form a complex . We found that Src was readily precipitated from cell extracts prepared from cells co - transfected with V5 - SH3PXD2B and Src ( Figure 4A panel Src ) . Src was absent in immunopre - cipitates obtained from samples transfected with Src or V5 - SH3PXD2B alone . The 120 kD and the 60 kD proteins in Figure 4A were SH3PXD2B and Src , respectively , as judged by Figure 1 . Expression of SH3PXD2B in various human cell lines and primary cells .

The rapid cellular redistribution of SH3PXD2B in Src - transformed Rat - 1 cells , together with its co - localization with cortactin in multiple cell types prompted us to examine potential association of SH3PXD2B with cortactin . In the above described experimental system V5 epitope tagged SH3PXD2B protein co - precipitated cortactin from lysates of 293T cells ( Figure 4B ) . Figure 2 . Epidermal growth factor receptor activation induces the co - localization of SH3PXD2B with cortactin and F - actin in membrane ruffles and lamellipodia . Serum starved cells were left untreated ( A – C and H – J ) or treated with 100 ng / ml EGF ( D – F & K – M ) for 10 minutes . Cells were then fixed and processed for immunofluorescence . Endogenous expression of SH3PXD2B and cortactin in HeLa cells ( A – F ) were detected using SH3PXD2B - specific rabbit polyclonal or cortactin - specific mouse monoclonal antibodies . Cellular localization of SH3PXD2B in Cos7 cells transfected with a construct encoding an SH3PXD2B fusion protein carrying a C - terminal V5 epitope tag ( H – M ) was visualized using a mouse anti - V5 monoclonal antibody and anti - mouse Alexa488 ( green ) .

Co - localization of SH3PXD2B with cortactin in HUVEC , macrophages and LA29ts fibroblasts .

( G – L ) Rat - 1 LA29 fibroblast cells carrying a temperature sensitive mutant form of Src were grown on coverslips and transfected with an SH3PXD2B - EGFP construct . Cultures were kept at the nonpermissive SH3PXD2B Regulates Lamellipodia and Cell Spreading PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 5 August 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 8 | e23653 Furthermore , 80 kD phosphoprotein in Figure 4A was identified as phosphorylated cortactin by re - probing the phospho - protein blots with an anti - cortactin antibody ( not shown ) . Although phosphorylated forms of both SH3PXD2B and cortactin were present in the complex ( Figure 4A ) , the SH3PXD2B / cortactin complex was also found without Src transfection suggesting that complex formation may be independent of tyrosine phosphoryla - tion ( Figure 4B ) . In the converse experiments we used GST - tagged cortactin to precipitate SH3PXD2B from lysates of 293T cells in which SH3PXD2B was transfected or endogenously expressed . As shown in Figure 4C ( top panel ) , SH3PXD2B was precipitated by the GST - cortactin from cell extracts containing endogenous or elevated levels of SH3PXD2B . In further pull - down experiments we localized the site of interaction to the C - terminal of cortactin corresponding to amino acids 336 – 542 ( Figure 4C middle and bottom panels ) . The interacting C - terminal region includes the Calpain cleavage site , the proline - rich region with numerous tyrosine and serine phosphorylation sites and the SH3 - domain of cortactin , partaking in protein interacions with chief regulators of the cytoskeleton [ 20 , 21 , 38 ] . Because the SH3 - domain of cortactin seemed to be good candidate for SH3PXD2B binding we assessed the binding of the C - terminal - cortactin - GST fusion construct with the W525K substitution . Changing the conserved tryptophan residue to lysine is known to abolish binding to canonical SH3 - binding sites in various SH3 - domains [ 39 , 40 ] . As shown in Figure 4C ( bottom panel ) , the GST - cortactin [ 336 – 542 ( W525K ) ] protein failed to precipitate SH3PXD2B suggesting that their interaction required an intact SH3 - domain on cortactin . Taken together , we identified Src and cortactin as parts of complexes containing SH3PXD2B and we presented data suggesting that cortactin binds to an SH3PXD2B - containing complex through its SH3 domain . The PX - domain SH3PXD2B binds PtdIns lipids . Binding of the PX - domain to specific membrane lipids is believed to contribute to the appropriate cellular localization of PX - SH3 - domain proteins [ 41 ] . Hence , we examined the specific - ity of the PX - domain of SH3PXD2B towards various PtdIns lipids in a protein - lipid overlay assay . As shown in Figure 5A , a bacterially expressed GST - PX - domain fusion protein specifically bound to phosphorylated forms of phosphatidylinositol ( PtdIns ) however , interaction with phosphatidic acid ( PA ) was also detected . These binding characteristics were reminiscent to the PX - domains of FISH / Tks5 and p47 phox [ 32 , 42 , 43 ] . In addition to binding all three PtdIns - monophosphates , - diphosphates , binding to PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 triphosphate was readily detected . Interestingly , interaction with PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 was rather weak compared to that of PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ( Figure 5A ) . This finding is in line with those by Hishida et al . [ 29 ] , showing strong binding of PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 but not PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 to the PX - domain of murine SH3PXD2B . Next we changed the Arginine residue at position 43 to Glutamine ( R43Q ) . Changing the homologous Arginine residue in p47 phox and FISH / Tks5 eliminated binding to both PtdIns ( 3 ) P and PA [ 32 , 42 , 43 ] . As shown in Figure 5B the R43Q substitution abolished binding of the PX - domain to immobilized membrane lipids . To further corroborate these findings we generated liposomes of Phosphati - dylcholine and PtdIns ( 3 ) P and incubated them with the GST - fusion protein containing the wild - type or the R43Q mutant SH3PXD2B PX - domain . As shown in Figure 5C , the wild - type PX - domain is predominantly found in the liposome fraction ( pellet ) , while the R43Q mutant was only slightly enriched in the pellet . Abram et al . suggested that the PX - domain is necessary and sufficient to drive podosomal localization of FISH / Tks5 in Src - transformed NIH3T3 cells [ 32 ] . Furthermore , Oikawa et al . demonstrated the importance of binding to PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 lipids by the PX - domain in this process [ 6 ] . We reasoned that a functional PX - domain should be essential for the proper re - localization of SH3PXD2B into membrane ruffles in EGF - stimulated cells . We introduced the R43Q substitution into the full - length protein and compared the cellular localization of the transfected full - length SH3PXD2B - V5 and the SH3PXD2B - V5 ( R43Q ) fusion proteins in response to EGF stimulation . Interestingly , similar to its wild - type counterpart , the R43Q mutant protein localized to EGF - induced membrane ruffles , suggesting that a functional PX - domain is not essential for correct cellular localization of SH3PXD2B . ( compare Figure 5D & 5G with 2H ) . Further - more , co - localization of SH3PXD2B with polymerized actin was equally prominent ( compare Figure 5F & 5I ) . Together these experiments suggested that phospholipid binding of the SH3PXD2B PX - domain does not play a major role in directing SH3PXD2B to lamellipodia or membrane ruffles . Development of lamellipodia and efficient cell spreading is impaired in the absence of SH3PXD2B Because SH3PXD2B co - localized with cortactin in EGF - induced membrane ruffles and lamellipodia , we examined whether SH3PXD2B plays an active role in the organization of these structures . To test this hypothesis , SH3PXD2B expression in HeLa cells was silenced by transient transfection of specific siRNAs ( si2 , si3 ) targeting different regions of the transcript . The efficiency of gene silencing exceeded 80 % in all experiments typically approaching 90 – 95 % ( Figure 6A ) . Stimulation of HeLa cells with EGF resulted in rapid development of membrane ruffles in cells transfected with control siRNA ( shown by white arrows in Figure 6B & 6D ) . By contrast , in cells transfected with SH3PXD2B - specific siRNA formation of membrane ruffles and lamellipodia was strongly reduced ( Figure 6C & E ) . The frequency of membrane ruffling was determined by evaluating a minimum of 100 cells for each cell population in four independent experiments ( Figure 6F ) . In a second set of experiments we created stable HeLa clones expressing SH3PXD2B - specific small heteroduplex RNAs ( shRNA ) or control shRNA ( with target sequences identical with si3 and si3c ) from a vector carrying a puromycin resistance cassette . After antibiotic selection cell lines with no SH3PXD2B expression ( Clones 1 and 2 ) and with normal SH3PXD2B expression ( Clones 3 and 4 ) were studied further ( Figure 6G ) . When stimulated with EGF , cortactin translocated rapidly into membrane ruffles and lamellipodia in control cells ( indicated by white arrows in Figure 6J & 6K ) , while translocation of cortactin in cells with diminished SH3PXD2B content was less prominent temperature ( 39 . 5 u C ) for 24 hours . Next , half of the cells were grown further at the nonpermissive temperature until the end of the experiment ( G – I ) . The rest of the cells were cultured at the permissive temperature ( 34 . 5 u C ) overnight ( J – L ) . Coverslips were prepared for immunfuorescence as described in Materials and Methods . Cortactin and SH3PXD2B were visualized as described in the legend for Figure 2 . Bars represent 20 m m . Co - localization between SH3PXD2B and cortactin was observed in over 90 % of the cells grown at the permissive temperature ( M ) . Over 100 cells were evaluated for each independent experiment .

Furthermore , we observed that 90 – 95 % of the cells with normal SH3PXD2B expression generated lamellipodia exceeding 10 m m ( Figure 6J & 6K ) while such lamellipodia in cells with decreased SH3PXD2B content was only sporadically observed ( Figure 6H & 6I ) . The lack of SH3PXD2B expression in many non - adherent cell lines and primary cells ( e . g . lymphocytes or unstimulated monocytes ) and its association with the actin cytoskeleton suggested that SH3PXD2B may play a role in cell adhesion to extracellular matrices and / or cell spreading . To examine the effect of SH3PXD2B on spreading of transformed cell lines we used the previously described HeLa lines in which SH3PXD2B expression was inhibited by constitutively expressed specific shRNA . SH3PXD2B - negative or control cells were placed on fibronec - tin - coated coverslips , allowed to attach and spread for various times including 30 minutes , one hour or 12 hours . Cells were visualized by actin filament staining . Cell sizes were quantified by image analysis of at least 200 cells on each image . We found that Figure 5 .

A consistent , approximately 25 % reduction in the average cell size is apparent even by visual inspection ( Figure 7B – E ) . Together , these experiments demonstrate that SH3PXD2B is one of the key components of the molecular assemblies regulating the development of actin - based membrane structures essential for cellular attachment and spreading . Discussion Development of membrane protrusions such as lamellipodia and membrane ruffles requires the concerted action of several signaling proteins and phospholipids [ 44 , 45 ] . In this paper we report that SH3PXD2B is an important component of the signaling machinery regulating the formation of these membrane structures . SH3PXD2B is a recently described homolog of FISH / Tks5 , a Src substrate required for the organization of Src - induced podosomes [ 7 ] . Both proteins are characterized by the presence of an N - terminal PX - domain , followed by four SH3 domains in SH3PXD2B , and five SH3 domains in FISH / Tks5 . FISH / Tks5 was described to localize to podosomes of Src - transformed fibroblasts [ 32 ] . An active involvement of FISH / Tks5 in the organization of podosomes was also demonstrated by Seals et al . showing that siRNA mediated downregulation of FISH / Tks5 in Src - transformed cells inhibited podosome formation and reduced invasiveness [ 7 ] . Podosomal localization [ 26 , 31 ] of SH3PXD2B and its role in controlling matrix degradation by Src - induced podosomes of murine embryo fibroblasts have also been reported . Data concerning the characteristics of the human orthologue of SH3PXD2B are sporadic , and little is known about the role this novel adaptor protein may play in the organization of other actin - based membrane organelles . Based on its association with podosomes , it is not unexpected that we found SH3PXD2B highly expressed in multiple tumor - derived cell lines ( Figure 1A ) . Analysis of the subcellular localization of the protein in unstimulated HeLa and Cos - 7 cells revealed an abundant cytoplasmic staining . In the presence of epidermal growth factor SH3PXD2B associated with EGF - induced membrane ruffles and lamellipodia ( Figure 2A – F ) . We also pursued to map the structural requirements for the translocation of SH3PXD2B in response to EGF . Based on the presence of the N - terminal PX - domain we hypothesized that a lipid - protein interaction might be the driving force behind SH3PXD2B translocation . PX - domains are lipid - binding mod - ules , present in several proteins involved in signaling and trafficking [ 41 ] binding to phosphorylated PtdIns . According to our experiments , the PX - domain of SH3PXD2B binds to all three PtdIns - monophosphates , - diphosphates , and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 de - tected by using purified recombinant GST - PX - domain in protein - lipid overlay assay experiments . Interestingly , a relatively strong binding of PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 compared to PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 was detected in compliance with the data reported by Hishida et al . [ 29 ] , and to some extent contradicting the results of the Courtneidge group [ 26 ] showing strong binding to PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 but not to PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 . Importantly , binding to PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 was also detected which was not detected by either group using the murine protein . Next we examined the EGF - induced membrane translocation of the full - length protein which carried a deleterious mutation in the PX - domain . Mutation of a conserved residue ( R43 ) located within the PX - domain had no effect on the localization of the full - length protein , suggesting that phospholipid - protein interaction is not the major driving force targeting SH3PXD2B to actin - rich membrane protrusions ( Figure 5D – I ) . This finding challenges the generally accepted idea that the PX - domain and its binding affinity to particular phosphatidylinositol phosphates targets PX - domain containing proteins into appropriate membrane compart - ments . Thus , in the case of SH3PXD2B , protein interactions may play a dominant role in appropriate cellular targeting . In line with this , SH3PXD2B is not the only PX / SH3 - domain containing protein where subcellular targeting is under the control of protein interactions . PI3 - kinase dependent indirect membrane targeting of p47 phox via interaction with moezin was suggested by Zhan et al . [ 46 , 47 ] . Although we found binding of phosphorylated PtdIns dispensable for the translocation of SH3PXD2B into lamellipodia , lipid binding by the PX - domain still could be responsible for the stabilization of the protein in the above structures . In line with this , upon activation by various chemoattractants , phosphoinositides including PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 are enriched in lamellipodia formed at the leading edge of migrating cells [ 9 ] . This latter finding also Figure 7 . In the absence of SH3PXD2B cell spreading is impaired . ( A – E ) The HeLa clones described in Figure 6 were seeded onto fibronectin - coated coverslips , fixed and permeabilized after 30 minutes and stained with TRITC - Phalloidin . Cell surface area was calculated based on images of over 200 cells using the ImageJ 1 . 38x software . Average size of the cells for two SH3PXD2B - negative ( clones 1 and 2 ) and two control cell lines ( clones 3 and 4 ) is plotted ( A ) . Panels B - E show representative images of poorly spread ( B and C ) and well spread ( D and E ) HeLa cells .

In our work several observations indicate that the presence of SH3PXD2B in lamellipodia and membrane ruffles and its co - localization with cortactin in these structures is not accidental ; rather , SH3PXD2B is requisite for the formation of these structures . Elimination of SH3PXD2B in HeLa cells by RNA interference strongly reduced EGF - induced lamellipodia forma - tion and also inhibited the characteristic membrane localization of cortactin ( Figure 6H – K ) . When SH3PXD2B expression in HeLa cells was inhibited , the cells spread less efficiently on fibronectin coated surfaces indicating a substantial role of SH3PXD2B in this process ( Figure 7A – E ) . These observations indicate that the role of SH3PXD2B is not restricted to the regulation of podosome formation . Our experiments revealed protein - protein interactions that might be crucial in SH3PXD2B action . We showed that SH3PXD2B co - localized with cortactin in EGF - induced membrane ruffles and was part of a complex containing cortactin , a well - known Src - substrate with a central role in the organization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton ( Figure 2D – F & 4B ) . Cortactin is a scaffold protein , which brings together several proteins at the sites of actin polymerization [ 20 , 48 ] . The N - terminal part of cortactin contains an N - terminal acidic region that binds to the Arp 2 / 3 complex and a repeat region with sites for F - actin binding . The C - terminal part contains a proline - rich region with Src - phosphorylation sites and an SH3 domain . This region of cortactin has been reported to bind several proteins , including WASP , dynamin 2 and WIP [ 20 ] . Although we cannot exclude that association of SH3PXD2B with cortactin requires other proteins , it is tempting that the SH3 - domain of cortactin binds to one of the proline - rich regions on SH3PXD2B . Indeed , in pull - down experiments we localized the region required for the interaction between SH3PXD2B and cortactin to the C - terminal part ( amino acids 336 – 542 ) of cortactin ( Figure 4C ) and showed that this interaction required the presence of an intact SH3 - domain on cortactin ( Figure 4C bottom panel ) . Importantly , the SH3 - domain of cortactin has also been shown to interact with FISH / Tks5 [ 49 ] . Surprisingly , association of SH3PXD2B with cortactin did not require tyrosine - phosphorylation of either protein ( compare Figure 4B with 4C ) . We speculate that , similar to p47 phox , induction of the functionally active conformation of SH3PXD2B may require phosphorylation of serine residues of SH3PXD2B , cortactin or both . In support of this , EGF - stimulation of tumor cells leads to phosphorylation of cortactin at serine residues 405 and 418 inducing a characteristic shift in cortactin electrophoretic mobility from 80 kDa to 85 kDa [ 50 , 51 ] . Phosphorylation of these serine residues by ERK1 / 2 has recently been shown to be requisite for efficient tumor cell motility , adhesion and lamellipodia persistence [ 52 ] . It is tempting to speculate that the phosphorylation by ERKs or other kinases on appropriate serine residues may be required for the translocation of SH3PXD2B to the membrane . By the interaction of SH3PXD2B with cortactin , a complex interface of five SH3 domains , two proline rich regions , at least seven tyrosine and multiple serine residues may be formed representing a binding surface with exceptional complexity . Association of SH3PXD2B with cortactin - containing complexes brings SH3PXD2B to close proximity with cortactin - associated proteins , many of which may prove to be regulated by SH3PXD2B . Although detailed description of the molecular scaffold of SH3PXD2B and cortactin is yet ahead of us , we identified SH3PXD2B as a novel interacting partner of Src and cortactin . Via modulating the cellular localization or the activity of cortactin SH3PXD2B may be a key regulator of cellular attachment and migration during the course of development , in the process of the normal immune response , or in migration and attachment of transformed cells . We think that our findings broaden our view on the multiple developmental defects observed in the absence of SH3PXD2B both in humans and mice [ 30 , 31 ] . Materials and Methods Cells and antibodies Human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) were purchased from Cascade Biologics . Human monocytes were obtained from leukocyte - enriched buffy coats obtained from healthy volunteer blood donors drawn at the Regional Blood Center of Hungarian National Blood Transfusion Service ( Debrecen , Hun - gary ) in accordance with the written approval of the Director of the National Blood Transfusion Service and the Regional and Institutional Ethics Committee of the University of Debrecen , Medical and Health Science Center ( Debrecen , Hungary ) . Written informed consent was obtained from the donors prior to blood donation , and their data were processed and stored according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki . Human monocytes were isolated as described previously [ 53 ] . Macrophages were differentiated in the presence of 50 ng / ml macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( M - CSF , Peprotech ) . The Rat - 1 LA29ts cells were a generous gift of Margaret Frame [ 36 ] . The A2058 melanoma cell line was generously shared with us by Margit Balazs [ 54 ] . All other cell lines including HeLa , 293T , COS7 , Jurkat , REH , THP1 and TF1 cells , were obtained from American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) and were maintained according to the distributor’s instructions . Media for the maintenance of TF1 cells were supplemented with 5 ng / ml granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF , Peprotech ) . The following antibodies were used in this study : anti - actin ( SIGMA ) , antiphospho - tyrosine ( 4G10 , PT66 , Sigma ) and anti - cortactin ( Upstate ) , anti - V5 ( AbD Serotec ) , anti - cSrc ( SantaCruz ) . DNA constructs To create V5 - tagged SH3PXD2B construct the full - length SH3PXD2B coding sequence was cloned into a pcDNA3 . 1 / TOPO - V5 - His plasmid ( Invitrogen ) . To create fluorescent protein tagged SH3PXD2B construct the full - length SH3PXD2B coding sequence was cloned into the pEGFP - N1 vector ( Clontech ) . An EGFP - tagged SH3PXD2B PX - domain was created by cloning SH3PXD2B cDNA encoding the first 130 amino acids of the protein into pEGFP - N1 vector . For the production of a SH3PXD2B PX - domain - GST fusion protein , the same cDNA was cloned into a pGEX4T1 plasmid . The R43Q , single amino acid change was introduced into the full - length SH3PXD2B - V5 construct using the Stratagene’s Quikchange site directed muta - genesis kit following the manufacturer’s instructions . Constructs were verified by sequencing . To generate constructs encoding various segments of GST - cortactin fusion proteins the full - length cortactin ( mouse cDNA ) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into BamH1 / EcoRI sites of pGEX - 4T - 1 vector ( GE Healthcare ) . cDNAs corresponding to the N - terminal part ( amino acids 1 – 334 ) and C - terminal part ( amino acids 336 – 542 ) of cortactin were also amplified by PCR and subcloned into EcoRI / XhoI sites of pGEX - 4T - 1 plasmid . The Src construct was a generous gift of Julian Downward ( Cancer Research UK , London ) and was used earlier [ 55 ] . Production and affinity purification of SH3PXD2B - specific antibody Polyclonal SH3PXD2B - specific antibody was purified from rabbit serum following intra - cutaneous injections of GST - SH3PXD2B Regulates Lamellipodia and Cell Spreading PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 11 August 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 8 | e23653 SH3PXD2B ( amino acids 23 – 430 ) fusion protein into rabbits . SH3PXD2B - specific antibodies were purified from the rabbit sera in two steps . First , GST - specific antibodies were depleted from the immune serum using recombinant GST protein coupled to glutathione sepharose beads followed by an affinity purification step using Affigel 10 beads ( BioRad Laboratories ) loaded with the antigen . Transient transfection , immunoprecipitation , western blotting 293T cells were transfected by the standard calcium - phosphate method . Cells were seeded at the density of 3x10 6 cells on 100 mm plates . Next day , cells were transfected with 20 m g SH3PXD2B - V5 and 5 m g c - Src either alone or in combination . To equalize the amount of DNA each transfection reaction was supplemented with the appropriate empty vectors . 48 hours post - transfection cells were lysed in RIPA buffer ( 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 5 % Deoxy - cholate and 0 . 1 % SDS ) containing phosphatase inhibitor mix ( Sigma ) , protease inhibitors : Aprotinin , Leupeptin , Pepstatin , Bestatin ( 20 ug / ml each ) and 1 mM PMSF . Lysates cleared from detergent insoluble material by centrifugation at 15 , 000 6 g for 10 min at 4 u C , were incubated overnight at 4 0 C with 4 m g anti - V5 antibody ( AbD , Serotec ) and 30 m l of ImmunoPure Immobilized Protein G beads ( Pierce ) or with glutathion - agarose beads ( GST pulldown experiments ) . Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with ice - cold 50 mM HEPES buffer , pH 7 . 4 , containing 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 . Precipitated complexes were subjected to SDS - PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes ( Immobilon - P , Millipore ) . Membranes were blocked with 3 % BSA ( Sigma ) , incubated with the indicated primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Amersham ) , and developed using enhanced chemilu - minescence ( ECL West Pico , Pierce ) . For precipitation with GST fusion proteins 5 m g of the specified GST - cortactin proteins were used as non - covalently bound adducts to glutathione - agarose beads . Separation of bound proteins and immunoblotting were performed as described previously [ 56 ] . Downregulation of SH3PXD2B expression in HeLa cells by RNA interference For transient transfection experiments SH3PXD2B - specific Stealth H siRNAs and ‘‘minimally’’ changed , control siRNAs were obtained from Invitrogen . The target sequences on SH3PXD2B mRNA were the followings : GCCTGATACCAATTGATGAA - TACTG ( Si2 - SH3PXD2B ) , GCTGGTGGTACATTCAGATT - GAAGA ( Si3 - SH3PXD2B ) . The control sequences were the followings : GCCGGATACCAATTGATTAACATTG ( Si2con - trolSH3PXD2B ) GCTAGTGGTACGTTCAGATTGGAAA ( Si3controlSH3PXD2B ) . Nucleotides altered to obtain the control oligonucleotides are underlined . Si2 - SH3PXD2B targets exon 4 encoding part of the PX - domain , while Si3 - SH3PXD2B targets exon 13 located within the region encoding the third SH3 - domain of SH3PXD2B . siRNAs were transfected into Hela cells at 100 nM using the RNAiMax transfection reagent ( Invitrogen ) . Cells were routinely analyzed 48 hours after transfection . To create HeLa cell lines stably expressing SH3PXD2B - specific siRNAs we used the siSTRIKE system from Promega . The double - stranded oligonucleotides representing the si3 - SH3PXD2B or si3control - SH3PXD2B target sequences together with sequenc - es required to form the double - stranded loops of the shRNA were cloned downstream of the U6 promoter region of the siSTRIKE - Puro vector as suggested by the manufacturer . 10 6 cells were transfected with siSTRIKE plasmid expressing SH3PXD2B - specific siRNA ( or mutant construct as a control ) using Fugene 6 transfection reagent ( Roche ) . 72 hours past transfection stable transfectants were selected in the presence of 1 m g / ml puromycin for 1 week . Next , single cell clones were isolated by limiting dilution in the presence of 1 m g / ml puromycin . SH3PXD2B expression was analyzed by PAGE and western blotting using the affinity purified antibody . Immunoblots were developed with the affinity - purified SH3PXD2B - specific antibody described above . b - actin was used as a loading control . We have isolated 20 puromycin - resistant HeLa clones which were further studied . Immunofluorescent labeling and confocal laser microscopy Cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS then washed 5 times in PBS and incubated for 10 minutes in PBS containing 100 mM glycine . Coverslips were washed 2 times in PBS and permeabilized in PBS containing 1 % BSA and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 20 minutes at room temperature . After 1 hour blocking in PBS containing 3 % BSA cells were incubated with the primary antibody in PBS plus 2 % BSA , washed thoroughly 6 times in PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 hour and finally washed 6 times in PBS again . Coverslips were mounted using Mowiol 4 – 88 antifade reagent ( prepared from polyvinyl alcohol 4 – 88 , glycerol , H 2 O and Tris pH 8 . 5 ) . Confocal images were collected on an LSM510 laser scanning confocal unit ( Carl Zeiss ) with a 63 6 1 . 4 numerical aperture plan Apochromat and a 40 6 1 . 3 numerical aperture plan Neofluar objective ( Carl Zeiss ) . Excitation was with 25 mW argon laser emitting 488 nm , and a 1 . 0 mW helium / neon laser emitting at 543 nm . Emissions were collected using a 500 – 530 nm band pass filter to collect A488 and GFP and a 560 nm long pass filter to collect A568 and RFP emission . Usually images from optical slices of 1 – 2 m m thickness were acquired . Crosstalk between fluoro - phores was negligible . Gelatin degradation assay Coverslips were coated with 1 mg / ml gelatin conjugated with Oregon Green488 ( Molecular Probes , G13186 ) dissolved in 2 % sucrose at 4 u C for 20 minutes in the presence of glutaraldehyde . After washing three - times in PBS coverslips were incubated with 5 mg / ml NaBH4 ( dissolved in PBS ) at RT for 3minutes , washed again as above and sterilized and dried using 70 % ethanol . Rat - 1 LA29 fibroblast cells carrying a temperature sensitive mutant form of Src were grown at the nonpermissive temperature for 24 hours then seeded onto coverslips coated with the conjugated gelatin and incubated for 9 hrs at either the nonpermissive or at the permissive temrerature . Coverslips were prepared for immunfuorescence as described above . Lipid binding assay PIP strips were obtained from Invitrogen . Protein - lipid overlay assay experiments were performed using SH3PXD2B PX ( 1 – 130 ) - GST and GST fusion proteins following the manufacturer’s protocol . Layout of the PIP strip was as follows : 1 . Lysopho - sphatidic acid 2 . Lyso - phosphatidylcholine 3 . Phosphatidylinositol ( PtdIns ) 4 . PtdIns ( 3 ) P 5 . PtdIns ( 4 ) P 6 . PtdIns ( 5 ) P 7 .

To prepare liposomes , in each experiment 100 m g total lipid was rehydrated at room temperature in 50 m l 10 mM HEPES , 140 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 4 , followed by vortexing until the mixture was homogeneously opalescent . The GST - fusion proteins were centrifuged at 80000 g for 20 min to remove all aggregates . One microliter of supernatant ( containing approximately 1 m g protein ) was added to 50 m L of liposome solution . Binding was performed at 37 u C for 30 min on a laboratory rocker . The vesicles were centrifuged at 80000 g for 20 min . Pellet and supernatant were separated , boiled and then subjected to SDS - PAGE . The protein was detected by western - blotting with a GST - specific antibody . Densitometry on scanned Images was done using the ImageJ 1 . 38x software . Cell spreading on fibronectin Glass coverslips were coated with fibronectin ( 20 m g / ml ) at 4 u C , overnight and washed twice with PBS to remove any unbound fibronectin . To block remaining binding sites , coverslips were then incubated with 5 % BSA . HeLa cells were plated onto 12 well plates containing the fibronectin - coated coverslips and fixed by 4 % paraformaldehyde at various time points after plating . Fixed cells were permeabilized by 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 5 min followed by phalloidin staining ( 0 . 1 m g / ml TRITC - phalloidin in PBS for 20 min ) . TRITC - phalloidin stained cells were photo - graphed using a Nikon Eclipse E400 fluorescent microscope . At least 200 cells from each slide were analyzed using the ImageJ 1 . 38x software ( NIH , USA ) .
