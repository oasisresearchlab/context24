Collective motion of large human crowds often depends on their density . In extreme cases like heavy metal concerts and Black Friday sales events , motion is dominated by physical interactions instead of conventional social norms . Here , we study an active matter model inspired by situations when large groups of people gather at a point of common interest . Our analysis takes an approach developed for jammed granular media and identiﬁes Goldstone modes , soft spots , and stochastic resonance as structurally - driven mechanisms for potentially dangerous emergent collective motion . PACS numbers : 89 . 75 . Fb , 63 . 50 . - x , 45 . 70 . Vn Studies of collective motion cover a broad range of sys - tems including humans , ﬁsh , birds , locusts , cells , vibrated rice , colloids , actin - myosin networks , and even robots [ 1 – 3 ] . Often , theoretical models of these active matter systems take a Newtonian approach by calculating individ - ual trajectories generated in silico from the sum of forces acting on each of N particles [ 3 ] . For the work focusing on humans , social interactions such as collision avoidance , tendencies to stay near social in - group members , direc - tional alignment , and preference for personal space have been examined to understand their role in emergent be - havior [ 4 – 7 ] . Generally , these studies show order - disorder transitions are driven by the competition between so - cial interactions and randomizing forces [ 8 , 9 ] . Moreover , these models have been incorporated into predictive tools used to enhance crowd management strategies at major organized gatherings . In extreme social situations such as riots , protests , and escape panic , however , the validity of this approach is diminished [ 10 – 12 ] . Conventional social interactions no longer apply to individual people [ 13 ] , and the actual collective behavior can be quite diﬀerent from model predictions [ 14 , 15 ] . Situations involving large groups of people packed at high - densities provide a unique view of the emergent col - lective behavior in extreme circumstances [ 8 , 10 ] . For example , attendees at heavy metal concerts often try to get as close as possible to the stage , but are unable to do so due to the shear number of people trying to attain the same goal [ Fig . 1 ( a ) ] . Consequently , the audience in this region of the concert venue becomes a densely packed shoulder - to - shoulder group with little room for individuals to freely move . Often , the stresses involved become dangerously high and security professionals stand - ing behind physical barriers are required to pull audience members from the crowd for medical attention [ 16 ] . At Black Friday sales events , we ﬁnd a similar situation when individuals seeking low - cost consumer goods congregate ∗ arianna . bottinelli @ math . uu . se † david . sumpter @ math . uu . se ‡ jesse . silverberg @ wyss . harvard . edu at the entrance of a store before it opens [ Fig . 1 ( b ) ] . As documented in many news reports and online videos , these events can have tragic outcomes in the critical moments after the doors open and the crowd surges forward leading to increased risk of stampedes and trampling . In extreme situations involving large high - density crowds , physical interaction between contacting bodies and the simultaneous collective desire of each individual to get to a stage , through a door , or to a particular loca - tion become the dominant considerations [ 5 , 12 , 17 ] . To generically capture these scenarios , we use a conventional force - based active matter model for human collective mo - tion , but remove terms that account for social interaction . With this simpliﬁcation , we have an asocial model for human collective behavior describing people aggregating around a common point of interest P . Here , we place P at the side of a 2D L × L simulation box [ Fig . 1 ( c ) ] . In this framework , each person i is modeled as a disk with radius r 0 (cid:28) L positioned at a point (cid:126)r i ( t ) subject to pairwise soft - body respulsive collision forces (cid:126)F repulsion i , a self - propulsion force (cid:126)F propulsion i , random force ﬂuctua - tions from environmental stimuli (cid:126)F noise i , and a rigid - wall collision force (cid:126)F wall i . For each of the N self - propelled particles ( SPPs ) in our model we have (cid:126)F repulsion i = (cid:15) (cid:80) N j (cid:54) = i ( 1 − r ij / 2 r 0 ) 3 / 2 ˆ r ij , which takes non - zero values only when the distance be - tween two particles | (cid:126)r i − (cid:126)r j | = | r ij ˆ r ij | = r ij < 2 r 0 [ 8 ] ; (cid:126)F propulsion i = µ ( v 0 − v i ) ˆ p i , where v 0 is a constant pre - ferred speed , v i is the current speed of the i th SPP , and ˆ p i is a unit vector pointing from each particle’s center to the common point of interest P ; (cid:126)F noise i = (cid:126)η i is a random force vector whose components η i , λ are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and stan - dard deviation σ deﬁned by the correlation function (cid:104) η i , λ ( t ) η i , κ ( t (cid:48) ) (cid:105) = 2 µσ 2 δ λκ δ ( t − t (cid:48) ) , which ensures noise is spatially and temporally decorrelated . The simula - tion box’s boundaries are rigid so that collisions with SPPs give rise to a force similar to the repulsion force , (cid:126)F wall i = (cid:15) ( 1 − r iw / r 0 ) 3 / 2 ˆ r iw , which is non - zero when the distance of the particle from the wall r iw < r 0 , and is directed along the wall’s outward normal direction .

( c ) Simulated trajectories of SPPs aggregating near a point of interest P located at the right - most edge of a simulation box . ( d ) Zoom in of trajectories show SPPs self - organize into a densely packed disordered aggregate . terms of the simulation unit length (cid:96) and unit time τ , we set the particle radius r 0 = (cid:96) / 2 , the simulation box size L = 50 (cid:96) , the preferred speed v 0 = (cid:96) / τ [ 12 ] , the random force standard deviation σ = (cid:96) / τ 2 and the force scale coeﬃcients (cid:15) = 25 (cid:96) / τ 2 , µ = τ − 1 [ 8 ] . Results presented here are for a collection of N = 200 SPPs , though varying population size has little eﬀect ( Supplemental Materials ) . Simulations were initialized with random initial posi - tions for each particle . Trajectories were evolved with Newton - Stomer - Verlet integration according to ¨ (cid:126)r i = (cid:126)F repulsion i + (cid:126)F propulsion i + (cid:126)F noise i + (cid:126)F wall i for a total of 3 , 000 τ units of time [ Fig . 1 ( c ) ] , where each τ consists of 10 in - tegration time steps . While data for the initial ≈ 50 τ was dominated by transient motion , we discarded the ﬁrst 300 τ from our analysis to avoid far - from - equilibrium eﬀects [ Fig . 1 ( c ) , linear path segments ] . By 300 τ the SPPs aggregated near P and settled into a steady - state conﬁguration with each particle making small random motions about their average positions [ Fig . 1 ( d ) ] . For the model parameters studied here , collisions and ran - dom force ﬂuctuations contribute roughly equally to these motions , which can be seen by estimating the relevant time scales . At average crowd density n , the collision time scale is τ coll = 1 / ( 2 r 0 v 0 n ) ≈ ( π / 4 ) τ , the noise time scale is τ noise = v 20 / 2 µσ 2 = τ / 2 ( Supplemental Materials ) [ 8 ] , so that τ coll ≈ τ noise at steady - state . Thus , while (cid:126)F propulsion i acts as an external ﬁeld conﬁning SPPs , collision and noise forces are responsible for position ﬂuctuations and the aggregate’s disordered structure [ Fig . 1 ( d ) ] . To better understand the role of local structure on global collective motion , we note a striking resemblance between these simulations of high - density crowds and previous studies of disordered packings [ 10 , 18 – 20 ] . In the context of jammed granular materials , a signiﬁcant amount of eﬀort has gone into developing theoretical tools that connect local structure to dynamical response [ 21 – 27 ] . A key analysis method involves the displace - ment correlation matrix whose components are deﬁned by C ij = (cid:104) [ (cid:126)r i ( t ) − (cid:104) (cid:126)r i (cid:105) ] · [ (cid:126)r j ( t ) − (cid:104) (cid:126)r j (cid:105) ] (cid:105) . Here , (cid:126)r i ( t ) is the instantaneous position at time step t , (cid:104) (cid:126)r i (cid:105) is the mean po - sition of the i th SPP , and all averages (cid:104)·(cid:105) were calculated by sampling position data every 10 τ for a total of 270 mea - surements . This sampling was chosen to reduce eﬀects of 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 2 4 6 8 10 - 0 . 4 - 0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 mode , m distance , d m o d e , m dr m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 m = 10 m = 195 . . . . . . e i g e n v a l u e , ( c ) ( b ) λ m x y RM σ ~ m - 1 ~ m - 2 ( a ) FIG . 2 .

( a ) Eigenvalue spectrum λ m of the displacement correlation matrix exhibits scaling properties between λ m ∼ m − 1 and ∼ m − 2 ( black dashed lines ) . Low m eigenmodes in both x ( blue ) and y ( orange ) directions are larger than a random matrix model ( RM σ ) , and thus describe correlated motion .

( c ) A heatmap of the polarization correlation function for the ﬁrst 10 eigenmodes as a function of distance d between SPPs . Black line is where the correlation function decays to 0 demonstrating a long - range highly correlated mode for m = 1 . auto - correlated motion while still accumulating suﬃcient statistically independent measurements in a ﬁnite time [ 21 ] . In this computation , we exclude underconstrained SPPs that do not contribute to the overall collective mo - tion . In the jamming literature these particles are called “rattlers , ” and they are distinguished by abnormally large position ﬂuctuations [ 21 ] . In our analysis , we used a po - sition ﬂuctuation threshold of 4 standard deviations to identify rattlers . However , our results were self - consistent when we varied this parameter from 2 to 5 indicating the methodology is robust to a range of threshold values ( Supplemental Materials ) . To extract quantitative information from the conﬁg - uration of SPPs , we computed the eigenmodes (cid:126)e m and eigenvalues λ m of the displacement correlation matrix . In 3 the harmonic theory of crystals , these normal modes fully characterize the linear response of the system to perturba - tions [ 28 ] . For disordered materials , these modes convey information about structural stability as well as coherent and localized motion [ 22 – 24 ] . Plotting the eigenvalue spec - trum λ m as a function of mode number m averaged over 10 runs with random initial conditions revealed an approx - imate power - law decay [ Fig . 2 ( a ) , blue and orange data ] . While the Debye model for 2D crystals obeys λ m ∼ m − 1 [ Fig . 2 ( a ) , upper dashed line ] [ 28 ] , the simulation data has an exponent between - 1 and - 2 . Using a random matrix model of uncorrelated Gaussian variables as a control for decoherent motion [ Fig . 2 ( a ) , black dotted line ] ( Supple - mental Materials ) [ 21 ] , we see the lowest six eigenmodes contain information about correlated motion . Plotting displacement vector ﬁelds for a few eigenmodes , we in - deed ﬁnd a higher degree of spatial correlation for lower m that rapidly diminishes with increasing mode number [ Fig . 2 ( b ) ] . To quantify this observation , we measured the polarization of the each mode’s vector ﬁeld and cal - culated the correlation function for this order parameter ( Supplemental Materials ) [ 29 ] . Remarkably , we ﬁnd the ﬁrst eigenmode carries a system - spanning displacement modulation [ Fig . 2 ( c ) , m = 1 ] , whereas the correlation for higher modes rapidly decays over a few particle diameters [ Fig . 2 ( c ) , m > 1 ] . To understand the origins of this long wavelength mode , we note the point of interest P breaks XY translational symmetry , and therefore the Goldstone theorem implies the existence of low - frequency long - wavelength deforma - tions [ 30 – 32 ] . This Goldstone mode is expected to arise at low m since eigenvalues are related to vibrational fre - quencies by λ m = ω − 2 m , and the largest eigenvalue in the spectrum occurs at the lowest mode number [ Fig . 2 ( a ) ] . Thus , the system - spanning m = 1 eigenmode is the sys - tem’s Goldstone boson ; when excited , it drives the SPPs to move collectively as one [ 33 ] . An example of a disaster resulting from this type of coherent long - range motion is known as “crowd crush” [ 13 ] . In these situations , a large number of people are suddenly displaced toward a wall , fence , or other architectural element resulting in dan - gerously high pressures [ 10 ] . As a consequence , injuries and death are known to occur . Determining if Goldstone modes are responsible for crowd crush would require care - ful image analysis of crowd structure and motion in the moments before such an event . Nevertheless , we expect any large dense gathering of people to exhibit this type of long - range collective behavior since its origins can be traced to the general principle of symmetry breaking . Another type of disaster found at high - density social gatherings is when sudden unexpected movements of the crowd cause individuals to trip and fall . Because the majority of people are unaware this accident has hap - pened , the rest of the crowd continues to move largely uninterrupted , resulting in injury or death due to tram - pling or compressive asphyxia [ 10 , 13 , 34 ] . This is more general than the excitation of a pure Goldstone mode , and is better characterized by a superposition of modes .

( color online ) Soft spots within the crowd undergo large displacements . ( a ) SPPs are shown as disks . Soft spots near the core of the aggregate colocalize with SPPs that dis - place the most in real dynamics . This region is subject to large structural rearrangements when the system is perturbed , and is likely a region where injury can occur . Apparent soft spots along the periphery are artifacts due to underconstrained edge eﬀects . ( b ) Averaging over all simulation runs show soft spots generally occur near the core of the aggregate a radial distance ρ ≈ ( 2 ± 1 ) away from P . ( c ) Structure factor g ( r ) measures the pair - wise SPP distribution and reveals structural features distinguishing SPPs in soft spots that suggest why they are subject to large displacements . Thus , we focus on the particles that displace signiﬁcantly more than average in a given mode m [ Fig . 3 ( a ) , dis - placement threshold is 2 . 5 standard deviations more than average ] ( Supplemental Materials ) . Studies of jammed granular media show these particles , which tend to cluster in regions called “soft spots , ” correlate with structural rearrangements when the system is perturbed [ 24 , 27 ] . Superimposing data from the ﬁrst 10 modes of a single simulation run reveals a soft spot near the core of the aggregate [ Fig . 3 ( a ) ] . Regions along the perimeter also featured large displacements , but they are essentially un - derconstrained edge eﬀects and therefore not relevant for our analysis . Identifying SPPs undergoing the largest displacements in each mode up to m = 10 in all simula - tion runs showed the region near the core of the crowd is the most likely area to ﬁnd soft spots [ Fig . 3 ( b ) , peak centered on ρ ≈ 2 ] . Cross - correlating soft spot SPPs with their real - space dynamics conﬁrmed these particles typi - cally displace the greatest amount despite being conﬁned within a disordered aggregate [ Fig . 3 ( a ) ] . We further studied the relation between structural dis - order and large displacements in soft spots by measuring the pairwise distribution g ( r ) as a function of distance r between particles ( Supplemental Materials ) and found that soft spot SPPs have an intrinsically diﬀerent struc - ture compared to the average population [ Fig . 3 ( c ) ] . The plateaued region in g ( r ) around 0 . 5 (cid:46) r (cid:46) 0 . 8 [ Fig . 3 ( c ) full line ] indicates soft spot SPPs are more highly squeezed by some of their neighbors , while the shifted peak cen - tered on r ≈ 0 . 9 indicates they’re also further away than average from other neighbors [ Fig . 3 ( c ) , dashed line peak at r ≈ 0 . 8 ] . These data suggest soft spot SPPs are being compressed tightly in one direction , and as a consequence displace greater amounts in the orthogonal 4 direction . As such , structural disorder is fundamental for large displacements and rearrangements [ Fig . 3 ( a ) ] [ 24 ] . Thus , we hypothesize soft spots in human crowds pose the greatest risk for tripping and subsequent trampling . If found true , real - time image analysis identifying soft spots in densely - packed human crowds may provide useful predictive power for preventing injuries . Our results thus far have focused on structural origins of collective motion with all model parameters kept con - stant . In real life situations , not all people behave the same : some agitate more easily , others less so [ 9 , 15 ] . Accordingly , we modify the asocial model to study how mechanisms for coherent collective motion are aﬀected by active perturbations from within . Speciﬁcally , we intro - duce a second population of SPPs so that a fraction f exhibits a more agitated behavior , while the remaining fraction 1 − f of the population are the same as before [ 8 , 9 ] . We model these agitated SPPs with a larger distri - bution of force ﬂuctuations in (cid:126)F noise i by increasing their standard deviation to σ a > σ , and analyzing the two pa - rameter phase space made of f and σ a . We ﬁrst consider the case σ a = 3 σ and vary f from 0 to 1 . Calculating the spectrum of eigenvalues λ m shows the qualitative trends are independent of f , though numerical values of λ m tend to increase with more agitators ( Supplemental Materi - als ) . To understand how long - range collective motion is aﬀected by agitated SPPs , we measured the polarization correlation function for the ﬁrst 10 modes by varying σ a and f [ Fig . 4 ] . Surprisingly , the correlation functions for σ a = 3 σ at various values of f show a qualitative tran - sition unanticipated from the eigenvalue spectrum . For f = 0 . 1 , a long - range correlated Goldstone mode is ob - served as before . However , multiple long - range correlated modes are observed for f = 0 . 2 , and no long - range corre - lated modes are observed for f > 0 . 3 . Examining other values of σ a shows a similar transition with increasing f from a single well - deﬁned long - range mode , to multiple long - range modes , to no long - range modes whatsoever [ Fig . 4 , rows left - to - right ] . The low - agitation and high - agitation limits are intu - itive . For low agitation [ Fig . 4 , white region ] , additional force ﬂuctuations through increasing σ a with low f or increasing f with low σ a induce small perturbations to the overall structure . As such , the existence of a Goldstone mode at low m is anticipated based on the homogeneous population results [ Fig . 2 ( c ) ] . For high agitation where the combined eﬀect of σ a and f is large [ Fig . 4 , dark gray shaded region ] , we expect local structure of the aggre - gated SPPs to break down and correlated motion to be marginalized . Consistent with this reasoning , we ﬁnd no long - range modes in the high - agitation limit ( Supplemen - tal Materials ) . Between the high and low agitation limit , we ﬁnd a boundary in the ( f , σ a ) phase diagram characterized by multiple long - range modes [ Fig . 4 , light gray shaded re - gion ] . This result is striking because it shows moderate levels of noise induces new coherent modes . Noting that correlated motion allows mechanical information to be FIG . 4 . ( color online ) Introducing a fraction f of agitated SPPs with variance σ a in (cid:126)F noise i to the total population N probes structural origins of collective motion . Each heat map is the polarization correlation function for the ﬁrst 10 eigenmodes as a function of distance d ( same as Fig . 2 ( c ) ) . Low ﬂuctuations ( white background ) preserve the long - range highly - correlated Goldstone mode near m = 1 . High ﬂuctuations ( dark gray background ) destroy long - range correlated modes . Intermedi - ate ﬂuctuations ( light gray background ) add new modes with long - range correlations , indicating stochastic resonance . transferred across the aggregate , an appearance of multi - ple long - range modes implies greater information band - width . In certain settings , signal enhancement mediated by noise is called stochastic resonance [ 35 , 36 ] . Stochastic resonance can be found in systems where nonlinear eﬀects dampen signal propagation , but by introducing random noise , the eﬀects of nonlinear terms are reduced leading to a restoration of signal propagation . In our case , nonlinear eﬀects come from structural packing disorder that sup - presses conventional phonon modes found in ordered 2D systems . Random noise from agitators increases an inter - nal pressure [ 37 ] within the aggregate that helps break - up this heterogeneous structure . Consequently , additional phonon modes are able to reassert their presence . In the context of our model , this ﬁnding means that modest ran - dom ﬂuctuations can enhance overall collective motion , which increases the potential for injurious outcomes in high - density crowds . Our analysis of collective motion in dense crowd simu - lations relies on trajectory data in order to identify and understand the emergence of Goldstone modes , soft spots , and stochastic resonance . With an eye to crowd safety , the dependence on readily measurable quantities com - bined with computer vision techniques [ 38 , 39 ] provides signiﬁcant potential for applications in real - time crowd management . In the long - run this may help protect at - tendees at large gatherings by reducing emergent risks [ 10 , 15 , 34 ] . More theoretically , the observation of Gold - stone modes hints that a collective motion analogous to the Higgs particle may also be found in future studies of crowd speed modulations . Indeed , developing an eﬀec - tive ﬁeld theory with quasi - particle - like excitations could present new opportunities to understand emergent collec - tive motions , their interactions , and potential hazards . 5 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank U .

The position is updated using the current speed (cid:126)v ( t ) according to (cid:126)r ( t + 1 ) = (cid:126)r ( t ) + (cid:126)v ( t ) ∆ T + 1 2 (cid:126)F tot ( t ) ( ∆ T ) 2 . ( S1 ) The algorithm then computes the force (cid:126)F tot ( t + 1 ) acting on each individual in its new position , and updates the speed : (cid:126)v ( t + 1 ) = (cid:126)v ( t ) + 1 2 ( (cid:126)F tot ( t ) + (cid:126)F tot ( t + 1 ) ) ∆ T . ( S2 ) We choose ∆ T = 0 . 1 . Such a value is small enough to make the trajectories smooth , but large enough to achieve a reasonable computational time . Every 10 time steps of the simulation we record each particle’s position and the pressure experienced due to radial contact forces P i = ( 2 πr 0 ) − 1 ( (cid:80) j F repulsion i , j + (cid:80) w F wall i , w ) . We run our simulations for T = 30 , 000 time steps , corresponding to 3 , 000 τ . b . Model time scales . For the model parameters stud - ied here , collisions and random force ﬂuctuations con - tribute roughly equally to these motions , which can be seen by estimating the relevant time scales . In this case , the collision time scale τ coll = 1 / ( 2 r 0 v 0 n ) ≈ ( π / 4 ) τ is the mean - free path ( 2 r 0 n ) − 1 ≈ ( π / 2 ) r 0 divided by the preferred speed v 0 , where an estimate of the average crowd density n ≈ N / π ( √ Nr 0 ) 2 is obtained by noting the steady - state conﬁguration of SPPs is roughly a half - circle with radius √ Nr 0 surrounding P . Similarly , the noise time scale τ noise = v 20 / 2 µσ 2 = τ / 2 can be found cal - culating the amount of time required for noise to change the correlation function (cid:104) [ v i ( τ noise ) − v i ( 0 ) ] 2 (cid:105) = 2 µσ 2 τ noise by an amount equal to the characteristic speed squared . Consequently , τ coll ≈ τ noise at steady - state . c . The correlation matrix . As the starting point of our analysis , we use the simulated trajectories to compute the displacement covariance matrix C p [ S1 ] . We treat separately the x and y components of the position vector (cid:126)r i ( t ) = [ x i ( t ) , y i ( t ) ] . The simulation reaches steady state after ≈ 50 τ , but we discard the ﬁrst 300 τ to eliminate far - from - equilibrium transients . Of the remaining 2 , 700 τ , we sample data every 10 τ , so that we have 270 time points . The obtained time points are separated by 100 simulation time steps to ensure statistical independence [ S1 ] . The equilibrium position (cid:104) x i (cid:105) is obtained by averaging each SPPs position over 270 time points . The displace - ments δx i ( t ) = x i ( t ) − (cid:104) x i (cid:105) around the mean position are used to compute the correlation matrix at the sampled time steps . The covariance matrix for the simulation is obtained by averaging over the independent time points : C p x = (cid:104) [ x i ( t ) − (cid:104) x i (cid:105) ] · [ x j ( t ) − (cid:104) x j (cid:105) ] (cid:105) , ( S3 ) with a similar computation for the y component . The 270 independent time points are suﬃcient for the covariance matrix to converge to the true correlation matrix of the underlying statistical process [ S1 ] . In other words , the averaging is suﬃcient to obtain equivalence between time and ensemble average . From now on we shall refer to C p as correlation matrix . d . Interpretation of C p . For thermally equilibrated systems and in the approximation of harmonic oscilla - tions , the dynamical matrix D ( the Hessian of the pair interaction potential divided by the mass ) contains all the information about the time - evolution of the system . The eigenmodes of D represent the vibrational modes of the system , D | λ m (cid:105) = ω 2 m | λ m (cid:105) , where ω m are the vibrational frequencies of the system , and ω 2 m can be interpreted as the energy that has to be transferred to the system to activate the corresponding vibration . For these systems , the correlation matrix is propor - tional to the inverse of the dynamical matrix D , thus the eigenvectors of C p are simultaneous eigenvectors of D , while their eigenvalues are inversely proportional and ω 2 m ∼ 1 / λ m . For thermal systems at equilibrium , the spectrum of C p can then be interpreted as the vibra - tional modes of an equivalent system of harmonic springs ( shadow system ) . The vibrational properties of the two systems might not be exactly the same , but studying the shadow system is enough to extract the properties of the real system . In our case , we are dealing with active matter and the observed dynamics is the result of the interplay of propulsion , repulsion , noise forces , and the environmen - tal constraint of walls . Our system is not at thermal equilibrium , and the spectrum of C p cannot be strictly interpreted as vibrational modes . We thus perform a Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) of the covariance matrix to extract the components of the ﬂuctuations that carry the information of correlated motion by comparison with the random matrix case RM σ . e . The Random Model RM σ . We use a Random Model of uncorrelated Gaussian variables to test what are the relevant eigenmodes in our system . We compute the correlation matrix of a set of random displacements 2 normally distributed with zero mean and variance σ RM . The variance is the same as the simulated displacements around each SPPs equilibrium position . The eigenmodes computed from C p with eigenvalues larger than the largest one of the RM σ model contain the relevant information about correlations . In our case we see that the ﬁrst six modes are above noise ( before removing the rattlers , Fig . S1 ) . f . Measures . For each component of the correlation matrix we compute the eigenvalues λ m and the eigen - vectors (cid:126)e im , i , m = 1 . . . N in the x and y directions for a total of 2 N eigenvalues . The eigenvalues taken in de - creasing order and plotted as a function of their index m give the spectrum of the correlation matrix ( for separated components x and y ) . Using the analogy with vibra - tional theory , we call ω 2 m = λ − 1 m the energy of the m - th mode , from which one could compute the density of states , DOS ( ω 2 ) . The DOS carries information about the rigidity of a solid to collective motion , but since the equiparti - tion of energy is violated for active matter , one should be careful when analyzing this quantity . The participa - tion ratio P r ( m ) = ( (cid:80) Ni = 1 | e im | ) 2 / [ N ( (cid:80) Ni = 1 | e im | 4 ) ] , with | e im | = ( ( e im x ) 2 + ( e im y ) 2 ) 1 / 2 [ S2 ] is constructed by combin - ing the x and y components . In crystal theory the partici - pation ratio of a mode describes how many particles in the system move in a given mode , and runs between 0 ( fully localized ) to 1 ( fully extended ) . If we think about modes as collective dynamics , another useful characterization of their collective nature and spatial coherence is given by the mean polarization (cid:126) Φ ( m ) = N − 1 (cid:80) Ni = 1 (cid:126)e im / | (cid:126)e im | and the correlation function of the ﬂuctuations around it C m ( d ) = (cid:104) ( (cid:126)e im − (cid:126) Φ ) ( (cid:126)e jm − (cid:126) Φ ( m ) ) (cid:105) d i , j = d , ( S4 ) From this computation , we deﬁne the correlation length l c ( m ) such that C m ( l c ) = 0 [ S3 ] . In order to characterize the structure around SPPs in soft spots , we use the two particle radial structure factor g ( r ) = (cid:80) Ni = 1 (cid:80) Nj (cid:54) = i δ ( r − r ij ) / [ N ( N − 1 ) ] , which measures the radial distribution of neighboring SPPs . In our analysis , the eigenvalue spec - trum , density of states , participation ratio , correlation function , and structure factor are averaged over 10 inde - pendent simulations of the dynamics with random initial conditions . g . Choice of the rattler’s threshold . In the literature , rattlers are underconstrained particles that feature an ab - normally large displacement in the lowest energy modes [ S1 ] . They are a consequence of local structure : neigh - bors pack inhomogeneously and form cages where these particles get trapped and vibrate without participating in collective movement . Following the analysis developed for granular materials [ S1 ] , we identify rattlers from the eigenmode analysis , eliminate these particles from our consideration , and recompute the eigenmodes and eigen - values for a new C p that only considers the population of non - rattlers . This procedure is necessary so that the lowest energy modes are not zero energy vibrations lo - calized on a single particle ( i . e . the rattler ) .

S1 . Outcome of the choice of diﬀerent thresholds when looking for rattlers and comparison with the random matrix model ( RM σ , dotted line ) . ( a ) The fraction of rattlers is a monotonically decreasing function of the threshold value ξ r . ( b ) Comparison of the spectrum of the eigenvalues with the random matrix case before removing the rattlers ( dashed ) and after at diﬀerent values of the threshold . At increasing ξ r the ﬁrst ﬁve to ten modes are larger then the random matrix case . ( c ) The Participation ratio increases for the lowest energy modes when rattlers are removed at all values of the threshold ξ r . ( d ) Comparison of the density of states before removing rattlers ( black dashed line ) and after ( solid colored lines ) at diﬀerent values of the threshold ξ r . Debye model for harmonic crystals ( red dashed line ) is shown for reference . this two - step computation of C p ensures we accurately measure collective motion of the system . The identiﬁcation criteria for rattlers we utilize comes from previous work [ S1 ] : a particle i is a rattler if dr im ≥ (cid:104) dr m (cid:105) + ξ r σ m , where dr im = | e im | = ( ( e im x ) 2 + ( e im y ) 2 ) 1 / 2 is the displacement of the particle i on the m - th mode , (cid:104) dr m (cid:105) is the average displacement of the particles on that mode , σ m their standard deviation , and ξ r is a ﬁxed threshold . In order to ﬁx a value for ξ r we compute C p , its eigenvalues and eigenvectors . We identify rattlers in the eigenmodes corresponding to the ﬁrst 10 modes with ξ from 2 to 5 . We consider the ﬁrst ten modes as they are the ones out of random noise . After identifying the rattlers , we eliminate them and re - compute C p , its eigenvalues and eigenvectors . We compute the spectrum , the DOS and the participation ratio and we average over 10 independent instances . We compare the above measures with and without the rattlers for diﬀerent values of the threshold [ Fig . S1 ] . The trend of the spectrum of the eigenvalues and of the density of states is not aﬀected by removing the rattlers . In particular , we ﬁnd the ﬁrst modes remain above random noise [ Fig . S1 ( b ) ] . The participation ratio [ Fig . S1 ( c ) ] is increased at all values of ξ r , suggesting that the rattlers we removed were particles that ﬂuctuated the most in the considered modes . Thus , we ﬁx the rattlers threshold at 3 Agreement Weighting functions Normalized agreement soft threshold 1 2 3 4 5 d i s p l a c e m en t t h r e s ho l d 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 0 . 05 0 . 1 0 . 15 0 . 2 0 . 25 0 . 3 soft threshold 1 2 3 4 5 p r e ss u r e t h r e s ho l d 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 0 . 02 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 08 0 . 1 0 . 12 1 2 3 4 5 d i s p l a c e m en t t h r e s ho l d 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 1 2 3 4 5 p r e ss u r e t h r e s ho l d 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 0 . 05 0 . 1 0 . 15 0 . 2 0 . 25 0 2 4 6 8 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 rattlersnot rattlers 0 2 4 6 8 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 1 2 3 4 5 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 f r a c t i o n un d e r l a r g e s t p r e ss u r e f r a c t i o n i n t h e s o f t s p o t s f r a c t i o n t h a t d i s p l a c e m o s t rattlersnot rattlers pressure threshold , ξ P displacement threshold , ξ D soft threshold , ξ S soft threshold , ξ S d i s p l a c e m e n t t h r e s h o l d , ξ D p r e ss u r e t h r e s h o l d , ξ P d i s p l a c e m e n t t h r e s h o l d , ξ D p r e ss u r e t h r e s h o l d , ξ P soft threshold , ξ S soft threshold , ξ S soft threshold , ξ S Agreement weighting functions Normalized Agreement FIG .

S3 . Each SPP is shown as a disk . Superimposing data from this simulation run for the ﬁrst 10 modes shows that soft spots arise in multiple modes overlapped in the same area . Apparent soft spots along the periphery are primarily artifacts due to underconstrained edge eﬀects . ξ r = 4 . With this value the rattlers are about the 5 % of the total population [ Fig . S1 ( a ) ] . h . Choice of threshold for soft spots . As for rattlers , we need to set a threshold for identifying particles fea - turing large displacement on the softest modes . These particles are the ones that displace most when a mode is activated and we might expect them to behave qualita - tively diﬀerently than the other particles . In particular we test if the particles participating the most in soft modes ( S ) are the same particles featuring a large real displace - ment ( D ) and , separately , if they are subject to large pressure ( P ) . We use the same criteria as for identify - ing rattlers and test a set of thresholds ξ ∗ ; ∗ = S , D , P from 1 to 5 standard deviations with respect to the mean value . Once identiﬁed the sets corresponding to each threshold , we compute their “normalized agreement” , as ν S ν D | S ∩ D | / | S ∪ D | . ν ∗ = 1 − N ∗ / N is a weighting function that dampens the measure of the overlap if the two sets are oversampling the total population . For a large set of thresholds for D and S , the parti - cles that participate most in the soft modes are also the ones that feature the largest displacements in the real trajectory . The normalized agreement function for S and D is maximum for ξ S = 2 . 5 and ξ D = 4 . 5 [ Fig . S2 , top ] Thus , we identify soft spot SPPs as the ones that have displacement larger than 2 . 5 standard deviations on at least one soft mode . Experiencing large pressure ( P ) does not seem to correlate with being a soft spot SPP [ Fig . S2 , bottom ] . SIZE EFFECT To check for ﬁnite size eﬀects in our analysis we simu - lated the same dynamics as described in the main text for N = 500 and N = 80 . We apply the same procedure as in the case N = 200 and we consider the measures that are relevant for the analysis described in the main text [ Fig . S4 ] . Pressure increases with size from 23 . 8 P 0 for N = 80 to 56 . 5 P 0 for N = 500 , where P 0 = v 0 ( 2 πr 0 ) − 1 is the inertial pressure of a SPP of radius r 0 and mov - ing with speed v 0 . Our result is in agreement with the empirical observation that crowd pressure builds up with the number of people involved in pushing . The eigen - value spectrum preserves its shape and thus seems to be a genuine feature of the dynamics . For increasing N , additional modes rise above the random matrix model for uncorrelated noise , RM σ . The lowest energy modes are still correlated over long ranges . In particular for N = 500 the ﬁrst mode shows high correlation at short distance and high anti - correlation at long distance , while the second mode’s correlation length spans the size of the system . However the energy gap between these two modes is smaller than for smaller system sizes . For both N = 500 and N = 80 the structure factor g ( r ) shows that the particles belonging to the core soft spot are slightly less constrained than the average structure . At the edge of the simulated crowd , the number of SPPs with large displacement on the softest modes is large in both cases , while the size of the core soft spot increases with N . CORRELATION WITH INCREASED ACTIVITY We model behavioral diversity by increasing noise ﬂuc - tuations σ a ∈ [ 1 . 5 , 4 ] for diﬀerent fractions of SPPs f ∈ [ 0 . 1 , 1 ] placed in random positions within the crowd . When looking at the spectrum of C p , the eigenvalues steadily increase at increasing activity level σ a and at increasing active fraction f [ Fig . S5 ( a ) ] , with more and 4 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 10 - 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 2 4 6 8 10 2 4 6 8 10 - 0 . 4 - 0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 5 10 15 20 2 4 6 8 10 - 0 . 4 - 0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 0 0 . 005 0 . 01 0 . 015 0 . 02 0 . 025 0 . 03 0 2 4 6 8 10 120 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 2 4 6 8 10 120 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 N = 80 N = 500 max pressure min pressure yx yx mode , m g ( r ) g ( r ) f r a c t i o n o f N f r a c t i o n o f N mode , m m o d e , m m o d e , m e i g e n v a l u e , distance , d distance , d s t r u c t u r e f a c t o r , s t r u c t u r e f a c t o r , distance , r SPPs in soft spots SPPs not in soft spots SPPs in soft spots all SPPs distance , r distance from P , ρ distance from P , ρ ( b ) 2 ( b ) 1 ( a ) 2 ( a ) 1 ( c ) 2 ( c ) 1 ( d ) 2 ( d ) 1 ( e ) 2 ( e ) 1 e i g e n v a l u e , RM RM x FIG .

Proportion of particles in the soft spots ( full line ) and outside the soft spots ( dashed line ) as a function of the distance from P ( ρ ) ; more modes becoming relevant in describing the dynamics . Correspondingly , the energy needed to excite these modes drops signiﬁcantly . For example , the ﬁve lowest energy modes at f = 0 . 1 and σ a = 2 . 5 need half of the excitation energy that is needed when everyone is calm [ Fig . S5 ( b ) ] . This means that a ﬁxed amount of energy provided to the system would excite an increasing number of motion modes as more active people are present . This could be explained by the increase in the size of soft spots , i . e . the number of individuals composing them , with both f and σ a [ Fig . S5 ( c ) ] . Intuitively , one might expect that individuals with larger σ a would be detected as rattlers or as belonging to a soft spot , having a larger displacement on the softest modes . This does not seem to be the case as unstable areas can double their size even when a small fraction of the population becomes very active , as for example for f = 0 . 1 and σ a = 3 . 5 . The heatmap representing the correlation function for the ﬂuctuations around the mean polarization for eigen - modes up to m = 60 [ Fig . S5 ( d ) ] expands on the corre - sponding ﬁgure in the main text and conﬁrms our inter - pretation for modes with m > 10 . At increasing f and σ a we observe that coherence decreases for low energy modes and increases for higher energy modes . Interestingly , for intermediate values of σ a and f several modes feature long range correlation . When both σ a and f are very large ( σ a = 3 , 3 . 5 , f > 0 . 6 and σ a = 4 , f > 0 . 1 ) our analysis does not ﬁnd long - range correlated modes . MATERIALS Crowd simulations are performed in C .
