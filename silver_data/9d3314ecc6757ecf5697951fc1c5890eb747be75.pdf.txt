Virtual Backlash : Nonverbal expression of dominance leads to less liking of dominant female versus male agents Janet Wessler , Tanja Schneeberger , Leon Christidis , Patrick Gebhard firstname . lastname @ dfki . de German Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence Saarland Informatics Campus , Saarbrücken , Germany Figure 1 : Four different agent conditions ( from left to right ) : male neutral , female neutral , male dominant , female dominant . ABSTRACT Backlash is a form of social penalty occurring when people behave counter - stereotypically . When promoting themselves , dominant females compared to males are typically liked less and paid worse , because dominance is associated with males , and proscribed for females . Such backlash effects have been shown in human - human interactions , but attempts to replicate them in human - agent interac - tions have not been successful so far [ 40 ] . Here , the goal was to show backlash effects for virtual agents with a nonverbal manipulation of dominance . In an online experiment , N = 223 participants watched the video of a female or male virtual agent presenting themselves as a career coach while using either large or small gestures . They rated the agent’s dominance , liking , competence , and made a monetary offer of how much they would pay for the coaching . Agents using large gestures were perceived as more dominant than those using small gestures . Moreover , a backlash effect emerged : Dominant fe - male compared to male agents were liked less . Participants were not penalizing the female dominant agent in monetary offers . Overall , participants rated the female agents as less competent than male ones . The results underline the importance of considering effects of the agent’s gender in research on human - agent interaction .

Thus , self - promotion or no self - promotion — both end in unwanted results for females . This dilemma is most prevalent in situations in which self - promotion is a necessary strategy to succeed : Leadership , negotiations , or running a business as a self - employed . Backlash effects can thus have serious consequences on career advancement and the paycheck for females [ 1 ] . In the digital age , advances in artificial intelligence research en - able authentic interactions with intelligent virtual agents ( IVAs ) . These are virtual body animations that autonomously analyze and adequately respond to social signals of human interaction partners [ 25 , 26 , 38 ] . Humans appear to be similarly susceptible and compli - ant to IVAs as to humans [ 30 , 34 , 37 , 38 ] . Moreover , they perceive IVAs as humanlike and attribute human characteristics to them [ 29 ] . IVA ’22 , September 6 – 9 , 2022 , Faro , Portugal Trovato and Tobin , et al . But does this perception extend so far that humans also engage in stereotyping non - human IVAs ? Do humans transfer their learned and many times implicit associations to a virtual opposite ? Research on social cognition shows that humans perceive fe - males as rather relationship - oriented , likeable and warm , whereas they perceive males as rather self - oriented , agentic and compe - tent ( although the gender difference in competence attributions has diminished in the last decades [ 14 ] ) . Such stereotypes can be prescriptive : People expect these characteristics from females and males . Group members who do not behave according to such expec - tations might face social sanctions . Expressing dominant behaviors might thus be proscribed for women [ 44 ] . Indeed , research on hu - man – human interaction has shown that dominance can have more negative outcomes for women than for men , especially in the form of lower likeability ratings [ 21 , 36 , 44 ] . The current research aims at investigatingwhether such backlash effects also occur for IVAs . We investigated if it is possible ( 1 ) to manipulate the perception of an agent’s dominance via their nonverbal gesturing behavior and ( 2 ) to then find backlash effects against female dominant agents ( vs . male dominant agents ) in the form of lower likeability and lower monetary outcomes in a business context . 2 BACKGROUND Dominance generally reflects influence on communication partners [ 8 ] . Based on the assumption that people can be influenced by IVAs in a similar way as by humans [ 30 , 34 ] , the agent’s expression of dominance should rely on similar parameters as for humans . Next to explicit manipulations of dominance ( e . g . , via verbal speech ) , past research has used implicit forms of manipulations , like body postures and gestures [ 44 ] . In humans , spreading out and occu - pying a larger space creates dominant impressions . In contrast , using small gestures and occupying a smaller space creates rather submissive impressions [ 3 , 20 , 39 , 41 ] . Apart from bodily expan - sion [ 20 ] , dominance can for example be expressed by physical closeness [ 20 ] , and eye contact , particularly while speaking [ 13 ] . Similarly , for IVAs , large vs . small gestures [ 17 ] , eye contact during speaking [ 22 ] , and an upright vs . tilted head position [ 5 ] increase perceived dominance . Thus , both humans and IVAs are perceived as more dominant through nonverbal behaviors with a larger spa - tial parameter [ 7 , 10 , 17 ] . For example , in one study , participants were asked to design dominant and submissive agents , respectively , through nonverbal behaviors [ 33 ] . When creating dominant agents , participants used rather expansive nonverbal behaviors , while they used smaller nonverbal behaviors when creating submissive agents . Thus , gestures that occupy more space create a more dominant im - pression , regardless of whether the behavior is exhibited by humans or by IVAs [ 7 , 10 , 12 , 17 ] . In the current study , dominant nonverbal behavior refers to using large gestures , while neutral nonverbal behavior refers to using small gestures . Such dominant gesturing might have more negative consequences for female humans and agents than for males . Gendered expectations are placed on women and men based on their existing gender roles and stereotypes associated with these roles [ 15 ] . Gender stereotypes are cognitive structures of socially shared knowledge about characteristic features of women and men [ 4 ] . Gender roles include descriptive stereotypes , i . e . , how men and women typically act . Such associations develop from observing females and males fulfilling different tasks in society ( i . e . , child rearing vs . paid labor ) [ 15 , 23 ] . Traits such as being emotional , like - able and caring are more typically attributed to women and often referred to as communal - warm . Traits such as being competent , assertive , and dominant are more associated with men and referred to as agentic - instrumental [ 31 ] . However , a recent meta - analysis on US polls showed that the gender difference in agency and com - petence ratings has diminished over time , while it still exists for communality [ 14 ] . Moreover , gender roles include prescriptive stereotypes about how men and women ought to act [ 15 ] . In general , study results on expectancy violation show that norm - violating individuals are punished with reduced likeability [ 32 ] . Hence , if individuals vio - late gendered expectations , they will probably experience social backlash : Assertive , self - promoting and dominant women are eval - uated as less likable and less hireable , especially in self - promoting situations such as negotiations [ 2 , 6 , 35 , 36 ] . A meta - analysis with k = 63 studies on the backlash effect found that dominant women were liked less than dominant males and were overall judged as less hireable [ 44 ] . Thus , overall , a low dominance expression seems to be required from women [ 36 , 44 ] . This meta - analysis found no backlash effects for dominant fe - males on competence perceptions : Averaged across the studies , dominant females were rated as competent as dominant males . Dominant targets were rated slightly more competent than non - dominant ones overall . Still , to get hired , employees have to not only be perceived as competent , but even more so as likeable and social [ 44 ] . Thus , perceived warmth in the form of high likeability is an important component for forming impressions of others . Backlash effects can also occur in computer - mediated negotia - tions : When interacting via text messages only , participants rated an angry female negotiation opposite as more competitive than an angry male one , and tended to like them less [ 42 ] . To the best of our knowledge , only one study so far has inves - tigated if assertive female IVAs face a backlash in negotiations [ 40 ] . Human participants conducted a salary negotiation in the role of a manager of either a female or male IVA as an employee . During the negotiation , the agent behaved either assertive or non - assertive . The assertive agent made higher offers and used assertive verbal content compared to the non - assertive agent . Moreover , the non - assertive agent had a higher likelihood to accept the partic - ipant’s last offer . The authors found no significant difference in the final salary outcome for the virtual male and female employ - ees . They found that in general , assertive agents were perceived as less friendly and more arrogant than non - assertive ones , but this pattern was similar for female and male agents . Thus , there was a penalty for being assertive independent of the agent’s gender . That study , however , had kept the nonverbal behaviors of the agent’s constant in all conditions . We argue that the nonverbal behavior is an important factor in creating impressions of other humans and virtual agents . This is why we took a different approach : In the present study , the verbal content of the message and value of the offer were kept constant , while the nonverbal behavior differed to create different perceptions of dominance . Virtual Backlash : Nonverbal expression of dominance leads to less liking of dominant female versus male agents IVA ’22 , September 6 – 9 , 2022 , Faro , Portugal 3 OVERVIEW AND HYPOTHESES The present study aims at investigating whether dominant nonver - bal behavior by a female virtual agent also leads to more negative reactions in human - agent interactions , thus trying to replicate findings from human - human research . In an online experiment , participants observe a video of an IVA presenting him - or herself as a coach for difficult social situations . The IVA explains that he or she is able to interact authentically with people . We manipulated the agent’s gender ( male vs . female ) and their gesturing behavior ( large / dominant vs . small / neutral ) . They used identical wording to explain their virtual coaching program for situations such as job interviews , and presented a price for this coaching . Participants rated how dominant , likeable and competent they perceived the agent to be . In addition , participants provided a counteroffer for the price of the coaching . It is expected that IVAs using large gestures are perceived more dominantly than IVAs using smaller gestures . If gender stereotypes apply to IVAs , dominant behavior of a female agent should violate normative expectations , since dominance tends to be associated with masculinity . This norm violation should negatively influence likeability perceptions of the virtual agent and their monetary out - comes . Based on previous findings , though , we expect no differ - ences for dominant female and male on competence perceptions . We formulate the following hypotheses : H1 ( manipulation check ) : Agents using large gestures are per - ceived as more dominant than agents using small gestures . H2 : Female agents with dominant behavior are rated as less likable than dominant male agents and neutral female agents ( i . e , an interaction effect between agent’s gender and gesture type ) . H3 : Agents with dominant behavior are perceived as more com - petent than agents with neutral behavior ( i . e . , main effect of gesture type ) . H4 : Female agents with dominant behavior receive lower mone - tary offers than dominant male agents and neutral female agents ( i . e , an interaction effect between agent’s gender and gesture type ) . Furthermore , we asked two exploratory questions : ( a ) Does the perception of likeability mediate the effect of gender on monetary offers ? ( if H4 is confirmed ) ( b ) Does the gender of the participants moderate the effects of nonverbal behavior and agent’s gender on the monetary offers ? 4 METHODS Following the recommendations by Wessler and colleagues [ 43 ] , all materials including the online questionnaire , data , and analysis code can be found on osf . io / mkv4f ) . 4 . 1 Participants We aimed for a minimum of n = 50 participants in each condition ( for recommendations , see [ 43 ] . Participants were recruited mainly via groups in social network and had to be fluent in German . Of the total of N = 275 participants , n = 52 were excluded either due to incomplete responses ( n = 34 ) , lack of informed consent ( n = 3 ) , fail to pass the attention checks ( n = 15 ) , or admitting to giving wrong answers on purpose ( n = 1 ) . The final sample of n = 223 consisted of n = 102 males and n = 121 females between 18 and 68 years ( M = 27 . 6 years , SD = 9 . 0 years ) . Psychology students ( n = 46 ) were rewarded with course credit for participation . All others — students of various other disciplines like economics or biology ( n = 127 ) or non - students ( n = 50 ) — had the option to participate in a lottery to win one out of five 10€ vouchers for an online store . Regarding political orientation , participants were somewhat nor - mally distributed across a continuous scale from ( 1 ) conservative to ( 101 ) liberal . However , the mean ( M = 71 . 45 , SD = 18 . 18 ) and median ( Mdn = 74 ) indicate that the sample’s political orientation was slightly more liberal . 4 . 2 Design Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions in a 2 ( Agent’s gender : male vs . female ) x 2 ( Gesture type : dominant vs . neutral ) between - participants design . This led to the following number of participants within each condition : ( n m _ dom = 59 ) in male dominant , ( n f _ dom = 53 ) in female dominant , ( n m _ neut = 57 ) in male neutral , and ( n f _ neut = 54 ) in female neutral . Perceptions of dominance , likability , competence , and salary offers were the main dependent variables . 4 . 3 Procedure This online experiment was conducted with SoSciSurvey [ 24 ] as part of a Master’s thesis . First , participants read and agreed to the informed consent form . Participants were then motivated to imagine the following scenario : They are about to graduate and , while looking for a full - time position , they have received feedback from interested companies . In order to prepare for the various job interviews properly , they are looking for a coaching . They come across a video on the internet . The participant starts the video of the virtual agent . A random generator determined whether this agent is female or male and whether he / she expresses nonverbal dominance or not . The virtual agent introduces herself / himself as Luca and explains how an interaction with her / him is possible ( verbal content available on osf . io / mkv4f ) . Luca offers a virtual coaching to prepare for difficult social situations like job interviews . The video ends with Luca stating the price ( 60€ ) for five sessions . Participants answered three attention checks to ensure they had watched the video vigilantly . The following items asked partici - pants regarding their perception of the agent’s dominance , likabil - ity , competence ( see Measures ) , and their willingness to work with the agent . Participants then imagined that they had had an initial coaching session with the virtual agent : They were convinced by the coaching concept , and they were aware that a coaching with a human is significantly more expensive . They indicated the max - imum amount they were willing to pay for coaching , how many coaching session they want , and how much they would pay for each session ( see Measures ) . Finally , participants reported demographic data . A debriefing followed and participants had the possibility to make comments . They could leave their email address to receive a summary of results . 4 . 4 Dominance Manipulation We generated the four different versions of the IVAs with the visu - alization platform VuppetMaster7 [ 18 ] . To manipulate the agent’s gender , a female and male character was chosen from a given se - lection with a corresponding female or male voice . Two videos IVA ’22 , September 6 – 9 , 2022 , Faro , Portugal Trovato and Tobin , et al . included a female agent , and two videos a male agent . The verbal content was equal in all four videos . In the two videos manipulat - ing dominance , the agent showed expansive , large gestures , which were fitting to the verbal content . In the other two videos , the agent showed small gestures , which should lead to a neutral perception of the agent . Figure 1 illustrates the manipulation of gender ( female vs . male ) and nonverbal behavior ( dominant vs . neutral ) of the virtual agents . 4 . 5 Measures Dominance , liking , and competence items were all rated on 7 - point Likert scales from ( 1 ) I do not agree at all to ( 7 ) I totally agree . Demographics included gender , age , income , political orientation , highest educational level achieved , field of study , semester , and which degree they aim for . Attention checks consisted of three items with two answer options each to check if participants had watched the videos attentively ( e . g . , Which kind of service does the virtual agent offer ? with the options " a coaching for difficult social situations like job interviews " or " a coaching for difficult social situations like a sales talk . " . Participant who answered one or more items incorrectly were excluded from data analysis . Dominance was measured with three items which were adapted and translated into German from [ 36 ] : " The virtual agent is dominant " ; " The virtual agent seems to control others " ; " The virtual agents seems arrogant to me " , Cronbach’s 𝛼 = . 78 . Liking was measured with five items which were adapted and trans - lated into German from previous research on perceptions of virtual agents [ 19 ] . Items were " The virtual agent is very likeable . " , " Overall , I like the virtual agent . " , " The virtual agent seems very kind . " , " The virtual agent seems very unfriendly . " ( reverse ) , " The virtual agent is very unpleasant . " ( reverse ) , Cronbach’s 𝛼 = . 89 . Competence was measured with three items adapted and translated from [ 11 ] , " The virtual agent seems competent to me . " , " The virtual agent is intelligent . " , and " The virtual agent seems knowledgeable . " , Cronbach’s 𝛼 = . 84 . Monetary offers were counter - offers to the virtual agent’s initial offer of 60€ for 5 sessions ( 300€ total ) . They were measured with three individual items , " How much would you maximally be willing to pay for the virtual coaching overall ? I am willing to maximally pay . . . . € for the coaching package . " , " How much would you be maximally be willing to pay for one session ? I am willing to pay . . . € maximum . " , " How many coaching sessions would you be willing to maximally take ? " " I would be willing to maximally take . . . sessions . " . Because the results were similar of each of the three items , here we focus on the willingness to pay for the total coaching package . 5 RESULTS Data analyses were conducted with R version 4 . 1 . 3 . Before data analysis , we examined if there were any outlying values with + / - 3 SD within each experimental condition . The only dependent vari - able with outliers was monetary offers from which we excluded n = 4 participants from the respective analysis of H4 . 5 . 1 Manipulation Check If the nonverbal dominance manipulation was successful , partic - ipants should perceive the virtual agent in the expansive gesture condition as more dominant than in the neutral condition . In order to test this assumption , a Welch’s t - test was conducted . Partici - pants who interacted with the dominant virtual agent ( M = 3 . 84 , SD = 1 . 24 ) perceived it as significantly more dominant than par - ticipants who interacted with the neutral virtual agent ( M = 3 . 44 , SD = 1 . 44 ) , t ( 215 . 55 ) = 2 . 26 , p = . 024 , d = . 30 . Hence , the manip - ulation of dominance was successful ( confirming Hypothesis 1 ) . Figure 2 illustrates the perceived dominance for each experimental condition .

Error bars represent + / - 1 SE . 5 . 2 Confirmatory Analyses For Hypotheses 2 to 4 we used 2 ( Gender : male vs . female ) x 2 ( Ges - tures : dominant vs . neutral ) analysis of variances ( ANOVA ) on the respective measurement , and report main effects and interactions . In case of a significant interaction effect , we disentangled it by looking at simple comparisons between the experimental groups . All means and standard deviations can be found in Table 1 . Hypothesis 2 tested whether female agents with dominant ges - tures are perceived as less likable than dominant male agents and neutral female agents . The ANOVA revealed a main effect of gender , F ( 1 , 219 ) = 11 . 23 , p < . 001 , 𝜂 2 𝑝 = . 05 . This main effect was qualified by a significant interaction of gender and gestures , F ( 1 , 219 ) = 8 . 52 , p = . 003 , 𝜂 2 𝑝 = . 04 . Subsequent comparisons showed that dominant female agents were liked less than neutral female agents , t ( 219 ) = - 2 . 54 , p = . 012 , d = . 49 , 𝐶𝐼 95 % [ 0 . 10 , 0 . 87 ] , and also less than dominant male agents , t ( 219 ) = - 3 . 35 , p < . 001 , d = . 29 , 𝐶𝐼 95 % [ 0 . 27 , 1 . 03 ] . Thus , Hypothesis 2 was confirmed : Dominant female agents faced a so - cial backlash , that is , were liked less than their male and female counterparts ( see Fig . 3 ) .

Dots on the left represent data points of individual participants , violins on the right the distribution within conditions . Error bars represent + / - 1 SE . Hypothesis 3 states that agents with dominant behavior are perceived more competent than agents with neutral behavior . The ANOVA revealed a main effect of gender , F ( 1 , 219 ) = 4 . 59 , p < . 033 , 𝜂 2 𝑝 = . 02 , and the predicted main effect of gestures , F ( 1 , 219 ) = 7 . 92 , p < . 005 , 𝜂 2 𝑝 = . 03 , confirming H3 . However , surprisingly , these main effects were qualified by an interaction of the two conditions , F ( 1 , 219 ) = 4 . 74 , p = . 031 , 𝜂 2 𝑝 = . 02 . Simple contrasts showed that dominant male agents were perceived as more competent than neutral male agents , t ( 219 ) = - 2 . 81 , p = . 005 , d = . 57 , 𝐶𝐼 95 % [ 0 . 20 , 0 . 94 ] . Moreover , dominant male agents were perceivedasmorecompetent thandominantfemaleagents , t ( 219 ) = - 2 . 14 , p = . 033 , d = . 40 , 𝐶𝐼 95 % [ 0 . 02 , 0 . 77 ] , ( see Fig . 4 ) . Hypothesis 4 stated that female agents with dominant gestures receive lower monetary offers than dominant male agents and neutral female agents . There were neither effects of gender F ( 1 , 215 ) = 0 . 39 , p = . 535 , nor gestures , F ( 1 , 215 ) = 0 . 26 , p = . 613 . Moreover , no interaction could be detected F ( 1 , 215 ) = 0 . 81 , p = . 369 , showing no evidence for Hypothesis 4 ( see Fig . 5 ) . 1 5 . 3 Exploratory Analyses Becausetheinteractioneffectonmonetaryofferswasnon - significant , we did not further explore a possible mediation effect with liking as the mediator . However , we explored whether the participants’ gender moderated the effects of agent’s gender and nonverbal be - havior on monetary outcomes . Multiple regression showed no main effect of gender , b = 50 . 54 , t ( 211 ) = 1 . 64 , p = . 102 , a main effect of gestures , b = 62 . 76 , t ( 211 ) = - 2 . 06 , p = . 040 , an interaction of the agent’s gender and its gestures , b = - 141 . 71 , t ( 211 ) = - 3 . 09 , p = . 002 , 1 Sixteen participants had values > 300€ on the monetary offer ; however , the agent’s offerhadbeenonly300€ .

Error bars represent + / - 1 SE . a marginal significant interaction of the agent’s and the partici - pant’s gender , b = - 72 . 50 , t ( 215 ) = - 1 . 69 , p = . 093 , an interaction of the agent’s gestures and participant’s gender , b = - 99 . 83 , t ( 215 ) = - 2 . 35 , p = . 020 . These interactions were qualified by a significant three - way interaction of gestures , agent’s gender and participants’ gender , b = 202 . 75 , t ( 215 ) = 3 . 29 , p = . 001 . To disentangle the interaction , we ran the 2 x 2 ANOVAs sep - arately for male and female participants . For male participants , a significant interaction between agent’s gender and gesture type emerged , F ( 1 , 95 ) = 7 . 75 , p = . 006 , while this interaction was not significant for female participants , F ( 1 , 116 ) = 2 . 71 , p = . 102 . All main effects were non - significant , all p s > . 067 .

Moreover , they paid slightly less to the dom - inant versus neutral male agents b = - 62 . 8 , t ( 95 ) = - 1 . 86 , p = . 066 . However , they paid the female dominant agents more than the neutral ones , b = 78 . 9 , t ( 95 ) = 2 . 07 , p = . 041 . Thus , it seems as if the male participants were punishing the male agent’s for being dominant . 6 DISCUSSION This paper investigated if IVAs showing expansive , large versus nar - row , small hand gestures in a self - promotion video were perceived as more dominant , and if female agents showing such dominance were facing negative consequences compared to male agents . In - deed , participants perceived larger gestures as more dominant than neutral ones ( confirming H1 ) . Moreover , a backlash effect for female dominant agents emerged : They were liked less than their male IVA ’22 , September 6 – 9 , 2022 , Faro , Portugal Trovato and Tobin , et al .

N = 223 . Dominance was measured on a 7 - point scale from 1 ( do not agree ) to 7 ( agree completely ) , Likeability was measured using 5 items each consisting of an identical 7 - point scale , Competence using 3 items each consisting of an identical 7 - point scale ( according to Carli et al . ( 1995 ) ) , Monetary Offers were entered manually . counterparts ( H2 ) and , surprisingly , even judged as less competent . However , they received the same value of monetary offers for the coaching as male agents ( not supporting H4 ) . Women face an impression - management dilemma in situations that require dominant and assertive behavior [ 35 ] . Dominant and assertive women are seen as less likable , more unsuitable for a job and are less likely to be promoted than dominant men , and receive worse monetary outcomes in negotiations [ 1 , 6 , 21 , 35 , 36 ] . In this study , we replicated such backlash effects in a human – agent interaction : Dominant female agents were liked less than dominant male agents and neutral females . This finding is not consistent with a recent study investigating backlash effects in virtual agents . This study found that assertive females were indeed rated as less friendly than non - assertive females , but as equally friendly as the assertive males [ 40 ] . They had used a different negotiation scenario and manipulation of assertiveness via verbal content and offer height . This might account for the differences in patterns . A recent meta - analysis investigated if the backlash effect on liking — statistically speaking the interaction of dominance x target gender — was moderated by explicit versus implicit dominance [ 44 ] . Explicit dominance involved directly trying to change the other’s behavior , while implicit dominance was communicated via more subtle modes like nonverbal or paraverbal behaviors — like in the current study . Over the set of k = 63 studies , the authors found that the backlash effect was present for explicit , but not for implicit manipulations of dominance . This was due to the fact that the dominance was more detectable in studies using explicit manipulations . In the current study , using an IVA , even the implicit manipulation of dominance by using larger vs . smaller gestures led to a higher dominance perception and a backlash effect for female agents . For competence , we had predicted that dominant agent would get higher ratings independent of its gender . Although overall par - ticipants rated agents using dominant gestures as more competent ( confirming H3 ) , this effect depended on the agent’s gender . Sur - prisingly , participants rated the dominant male agents as the most competent , and in general , the female agents as less competent than males . This contradicts findings that the gender gap in competence judgements has diminished in recent decades [ 14 ] , that backlash effects usually do not emerge on competence [ 44 ] , and that females under some conditions even have a competence advantage [ 27 ] . Moreover , our context was neither specifically male nor female : Al - though agents were promoting themselves , they offered a coaching for difficult social situations like job interviews . Thus , stereotypical female skills like being communicative and relationship - oriented should be necessary . Given such a task , the gender gap in compe - tence ratings is surprising . Supposedly , some other features might have influenced the competence perception , for example , how the agents were dressed or their hair colour . Future research could replicate this study with agents looking similar and wearing the same clothes . Like previous studies , this study showed no support for a back - lash effect of the monetary offer that agents had received [ 40 , 42 ] . This is contrary to findings in human – human interactions in which females do not get the outcomes they request , unless advocating for others [ 2 , 28 ] . One possible explanation could be that participants were not negotiating about real monetary outcomes , and it could have been hard to imagine to actually pay a virtual agent for its service . Participant’s gender did moderate the effects on monetary outcomes , but in a way that male participants seemed to rather punish dominant male agents . Indeed , there is evidence that men behave more competitively with other men , but more prosocial with women [ 9 ] . Future research could explore this interesting effect further . The current findings raise the question of how IVAs should be designed . On the one hand , designing gender - neutral or even counter - stereotypical IVAs could be an important step to change and counteract stereotypical associations in the long run ( for a sim - ilar discussion about gender stereotypes in designing robots , see [ 16 ] ) . One the other hand , if the goal is to create pleasant interac - tions , designing stereotype - congruent agents might result in better evaluations . In the context of the current study , such evaluations did not influence participant’s willingness to pay for the coaching . Also , when exploratorily investigating participant’s willingness to work with the agents , no effects of the experimental groups emerged , all p s > . 14 . Although dominant females might be liked less , the behavioral intentions towards them were not different from those towards the stereotype - congruent agents . Virtual Backlash : Nonverbal expression of dominance leads to less liking of dominant female versus male agents IVA ’22 , September 6 – 9 , 2022 , Faro , Portugal The expression of dominance seems to be especially critical for females in self - promoting contexts like a salary negotiation or like in the present study , making an offer as a self - employed coach . If a female agent is showing dominance while promoting somebody else , such backlash effects might diminish — like it is the case for humans [ 1 ] . Future research could explore if dominant female agents promoting somebody else rather than themselves face less social costs . One limitation of this study was that participants were watch - ing a video of an IVA rather than interacting with them . Future research could try to replicate these findings in an interactive sce - nario . Second , we had manipulated dominance via gesturing , but in an interaction , also other forms of dominance manipulation might be interesting ( e . g . , eye contact while speaking ) . Third , possible confounds could have influenced the results of the current study . For example , the female’s dominant gestures might have been per - ceived as less fluid or realistic than the male’s dominant gestures . Although we kept the conditions and parameters of the gestures identical , In future research it would be favorable to ( 1 ) include a participant question about the perceptions of possible confounds , and ( 2 ) to use several different agents from the same gender in a within - participant design in order to rule out agent specific con - founds . 7 CONCLUSION This study replicated the so - called backlash effect known from human – human interaction in a human – virtual agent setting : Par - ticipants judged female agents using more spacious and thus more dominant gestures as less likeable and less competent than domi - nant male and neutral female agents . Nevertheless , dominant fe - males received equally high monetary offers as the other agents . This research shows the importance of taking the agent’s gender into account in research on social perception and cognition in hu - man – agent interaction .
