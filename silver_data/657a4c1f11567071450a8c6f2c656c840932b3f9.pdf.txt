Towards Integrated Graduate Skills for UK Computing Science Students Rosanne English University of Strathclyde Glasgow , United Kingdom Rosanne . English @ strath . ac . uk Alan Hayes University of Bath Bath , United Kingdom A . Hayes @ bath . ac . uk ABSTRACT In preparing computing science students for industry , degree con - tent often focuses on technical skills such as programming . Such skills are essential for a successful post - study career in industry and is popular with students . However , industry notes that students are often limited in what can be referred to as graduate attributes or transferable skills . Such skills include effective teamwork , com - munication , and critical thinking amongst others . Similar gaps have also been demonstrated for computing science students more specifically , resulting in industry developing their own training programmes for graduates . To address this issue , graduate attributes could be incorporated more readily into computing curricula . Within the UK this is dis - cussed in accreditation requirements as well as higher education frameworks . However , research which aims to explore how to achieve this is still comparatively limited . Building on existing work in this area , this paper presents a thematic analysis of gradu - ate attributes at Russell Group Universities in the UK to identify the most common attribute themes , and uses the most frequent themes to begin to consider how these could be more readily embedded in CS curricula .

Skills such as effective communication , problem solving and the ability to work in a team are common examples of graduate attributes .

For example , Fung at University College London developed a frame - work which allows students to explore learning from a research led perspective and a key dimension is the ability to ”connect aca - demic learning with workplace learning " [ 16 ] . Other universities claim attributes such as " independent and critical thinkers " ( Uni - versity of Glasgow [ 35 ] ) and “effective and influential contributors” ( University of Edinburgh , [ 33 ] ) . Whilst there are often overlapping attributes across universi - ties , the wording and attributes claimed can vary by University depending on how they market themselves to students [ 9 ] . Wong et al . reviewed UK university websites and discussed the themes which arose within those which provided details on grad - uate attributes . However the work did not explore this within a computing context . This work in contrast aims to complete a similar review , whilst presenting a formal thematic analysis of the most common graduate attributes in a subset of UK universities . We also begin to consider how to incorporate these into a computing science context more systematically . Graduate level skills are also addressed beyond institutions , in the Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree - Awarding Bodies ( FHEQ ) . At each level of the frameworks , transfer - able skills are identified as an essential part of the qualification . As the level of study increases , the students transferable skills expand to reflect a higher level of attainment such as decision making in complex contexts and being able to take personal responsibility and initiative [ 14 ] . Such recognition emphasises the importance placed on developing these skills . In spite of this awareness within higher education , industry notes a skills gap in graduates . This can be seen in the Quacquarelli Symonds ( QS , who also generate the QS world University rankings ) report which explores the Global Skills Gap [ 43 ] . QS interview employers across the world in regards to new graduates trans - ferable skills . Technology focused employers indicated the three most important skills were teamwork , problem solving and flexi - bility / adaptability [ 43 ] . However , the three main skills gaps in the 2019 report were in problem solving , creativity , and communication . Highlighting that despite effort to incorporate such skills , students are not demonstrating these competences well . In contrast , em - ployers were most satisfied with technical skills , teamwork and flexibility . Technical skills is perhaps unsurprising , as students en - gage well with these and they are directly assessed . Teamwork is arguably also unsurprising , as most degree programmes have re - quired elements of group work which are also often assessed . This is often due to accreditation requirements , such as with the British Computing Society ( BCS ) . Students require a degree of flexibility to navigate a range of topics and lecturers as well as general challenges UKICER 2022 , Sept , 2022 , Dublin , Ireland Rosanne English and Alan Hayes encountered throughout a degree which perhaps also explains why students are demonstrating flexibility in the workplace . This skills gap could partly be explained by the challenge in embedding such skills in the curriculum [ 18 ] . Work by Green et al . explores a range of reasons this is hard to implement in practice , but one reason of particular interest is the challenge of meaningfully adapting the skills to the relevant disciplines [ 18 ] . This is also highlighted by Ward et al . who present a taxonomy for 21st Century ( C21 ) skills ( fundamentally similar to graduate attributes , though named differently ) based on accreditation requirements for a range of disciplines [ 49 ] . In order to explore this within a computing science ( CS ) context , this paper presents an initial review and analysis of graduate skills as applied to a CS context . In Section 2 we explore related work , considering the skills gap as it applies to CS graduates , how gradu - ate attributes in CS are promoted through bodies such as QAA ( the Quality Assurance Agency ) and present a brief overview of prior work in embedding graduate attributes in CS curricula . Section 3 presents the method applied to the data to identify common themes in graduate attributes , before considering the results of this anal - ysis in Section 4 and considering initial proposals for embedding these within CS programmes in Section 5 . Potential limitations are discussed in Section 6 , and a conclusion is presented in Section 7 . 2 RELATED WORK In UK computing science degrees , a strong focus is often placed on meeting industry expectations of technical competency . Students are supported in developing technical skills such as programming , software design , and database management . However , industry also values non - technical skills such as communication and team work [ 43 ] , without which students may struggle to gain or retain graduate employment . 2 . 1 Graduate Skills Gap in Computing Employers of computing graduates note that they do not have sufficient transferable skills such as effective communication and problem solving ( [ 3 ] , [ 44 ] ) . Indeed even technical skills are some - times lacking . This is evidenced by Eckerdal et al . where computer science students nearing graduation were given a system to design , and were unable of doing so [ 12 ] . This could be attributed to the focus on technical skills and a ’get it working’ mentality [ 11 ] as well as the challenge of applying problem solving skills to a new context [ 17 ] . Similar issues were found by Haddad , who performed an as - sessment of recent graduates cognitive abilities by asking them to complete a case study [ 21 ] . Haddad noted several skills which were lacking , including lack of reasoning ( recent graduates had a single approach to problem solving ) and analysis ( recent graduates often thought of code first , rather than analysing the problem at an abstract level ) . As a result of this perceived gap , technology companies are de - veloping and delivering their own intensive training courses for new graduates . For example , Microsoft have developed training to bridge this gap as new graduates are lacking key skills and at - tributes [ 5 ] . It is clear in computing science degrees such skills need to be more explicitly designed into the degrees , as argued by Young [ 53 ] . Young argues that computing science degrees ( Graduate Ap - prenticeships specifically ) should be more explicit in incorporating such skills . 2 . 2 Recognition of Value from UK Bodies There is recognition of the value of such skills in the computing science domain through UK policy . For example , the Quality Assur - ance Agency for Higher Education ( QAA ) subject benchmark for computing explicitly identifies required graduate skills . In particu - lar interpersonal and team working skills , computational problem solving ( critical thinking ) and intellectual skills ( critical analysis , ability to make judgements and adaptability ) [ 15 ] . Additionally , the British Computer Society ( BCS , the Chartered Institute for IT ) degree accreditation aligns with the QAA bench - mark , and identifies transferable skills as requirements for accred - itation . This includes " problem solving , working with others , ef - fective information management and information retrieval skills , numeracy in both understanding and presenting cases involving a quantitative dimension , communication skills in electronic as well as written and oral form to a range of audiences and planning self - learning and improving performance as the foundation for on - going professional development " [ 2 ] . In spite of these efforts and the increase in CS graduates ( e . g . HESA data shows an increase of 11080 students studying computing in 2020 - 21 compared to 19 - 20 [ 23 ] ) there is an overall lower em - ployment rate of CS graduates . The Shadbolt review of Computer Sciences Degree Accreditation and Graduate Employability in 2016 reviewed Computing Science English Higher Education provision in an effort to understand why computer sciences undergraduate students in the UK suffered from a lower employment rate [ 46 ] . In particular , stakeholders were consulted on what made graduates less employable . One of the key reasons identified was a lack of well developed ’softer’ skills such as communication and critical thinking . This resulted in a recommendation that HE providers should consider opportunities to ensure students develop transfer - able skills alongside their academic studies . Since the Shadbolt review in 2016 , work has been completed by BCS in an effort to incorporate the recommendations made , as reported by Crick et al . [ 10 ] . In particular , BCS have added a ques - tion which asks HEIs to describe how graduate skills are developed through the programme and how students are supported in this respect . However , this does not assist HEIs in addressing the issue - it simply recognises that they should . 2 . 3 Embedding Graduate Attributes in CS Students - Prior Work In efforts to address this , there has been work in recent years ex - ploring the incorporation of graduate attributes in the computing curriculum . For example , Groeneveld et al . reviewed non - technical courses within CS programmes across Europe , examining the syl - labus to identify transferable skills . A key finding of this research was that such skills are embedded in the CS curriculum according to the syllabus . Carter notes two general approaches to incorporating these skills , one is to have it embedded across the programme or alternatively Towards Integrated Graduate Skills for UK Computing Science Students UKICER 2022 , Sept , 2022 , Dublin , Ireland create a specific module to cover such skills . The single module ap - proach is undesirable , as Carter notes the challenge of incorporating these skills into a specific module addressing this due to students perceptions that they are being taught skills they already know . Carter suggests incorporating written reports and documentation into technical exercises to develop student skills . Additionally , Hoffman et al . report on a project to incorporate communication skills into the computing science curriculum ( [ 25 ] , [ 24 ] ) . Through this work , a range of strategies for incorporating communication into computing curriculum were developed . For example , use of scenarios in software development project modules which require regular reporting to ’supervisors’ [ 24 ] . 2 . 4 Research Question This paper takes a different approach to identifying a set of trans - ferable skills as it explores graduate skills through a University lens using thematic analysis . This allows us to capture any skills which may not explicitly be covered in syllabus information for CS programmes ( such as those presented by Groeneveld et al . ) , but are important to Universities and could be seen as valuable by employers . Of the skills identified by Groeneveld et al . , whilst there was some cross over , presentation skills , give / receive feedback , ac - countability and conflict resolution did not fall within the themes identified and reported in Section 4 [ 19 ] . Thus this work provides a different perspective by considering skills for all graduates and how this can be more readily embedded in CS degrees . In this paper , we aim to explore the following research questions : RQ - 1 : What are the most frequent themes within graduate attributes from UK Russell Group Universities ? RQ - 2 : How can the most frequent themes be embedded within in a CS context ? Given the UK context of this work , it was decided that UK Russell Group Universities were an appropriate initial set of Universities to explore as it provided a recognised grouping of UK universities which are well established . The next section details the method used to identify the most frequent themes in graduate attributes as a starting point to identify key graduate skills which could then be more widely integrated into computing science curricula to aid development . The eventual aim of the work is to develop a framework of patterns for incorporating graduate skills into computing science curricula . 3 METHOD To address RQ - 1 , a thematic analysis of graduate attributes from Russell Group Universities was completed . The method followed to generate the analysis is provided in this section . The websites for each University were explored to identify any graduate attributes . It should be noted that there may be some Universities with graduate attributes which are not externally ad - vertised through the website which is a potential limitation of the work . Limitations are presented in Section 6 . There are a total of 24 Russell Group Universities . Of the 24 universities in scope for the analysis , a total of 15 universities were identified as having graduate attributes from their websites . These were as follows : The University of Birmingham [ 30 ] , The University of Bristol [ 31 ] , The University of Cambridge [ 32 ] , Durham University [ 48 ] , The Uni - versity of Edinburgh [ 33 ] , Exeter University [ 34 ] , The University of Glasgow [ 35 ] , Imperial College London [ 27 ] , King’s College London [ 28 ] , The University of Leeds [ 36 ] , Liverpool University [ 37 ] , The University of Manchester [ 39 ] , Newcastle University [ 40 ] , Queen Mary Belfast [ 38 ] and the University of Sheffield [ 41 ] . To determine overlap of graduate attributes across these Uni - versities , an inductive thematic analysis methodology was used , meaning that the themes were identified from the data rather than approaching with pre - defined perceptions . The process followed is that proposed by Braun and Clarke [ 4 ] . ( 1 ) Familiarisation with the data ( 2 ) Generating initial codes ( 3 ) Generating initial themes ( 4 ) Review themes ( 5 ) Defining and naming themes ( 6 ) Reporting Firstly , a list of the graduate attributes according to each Univer - sity was documented using their own wording . This was gathered from externally facing websites , and as such may be limited as some Universities may only have internally identified graduate attributes . Each of the two authors independently examined the data to become familiar with it . Initial codes were then generated inde - pendently by each author based on their review of the data . Note that multiple themes could arise within a single graduate attribute as these could combine separate but related qualities such as ”An imaginative and critical thinker and problem solver” [ 34 ] which was considered to cover both critical thinking and problem solving skills . Each author then examined their own codes to develop themes independently . The authors then met to review and compare inde - pendent codes and themes in order to identify and define the final themes for reporting in this paper . Once a final code book had been identified , by resolving any discrepancies and discussing reasoning behind codes , the data was then coded using the consensus themes . Inter - rater reliability was not calculated on the basis that there were little differences in the labelling of graduate attributes given the frequent re - use of the same terms across universities e . g . global citizenship . The results of this process are reported in Section 4 . 4 RESULTS The thematic analysis of the graduate attributes for the set of Russell Group universities resulted in the themes and frequencies outlined in Table 1 . Note that a theme was not counted more than once for a University , and thus the count values represent the number of universities which had graduate attributes which aligned with the theme . Recall a total of 15 Universities out of 24 were identified as having graduate attributes . These are linked in the references . Table 1 also provides examples of some of the graduate attributes which exemplified these themes . Table 1 provides a summary of the results from the thematic analysis of the Russell Group Universities . It helps us answer RQ - 1 in that it has a clear set of frequent themes , with 80 % of Universities demonstrating the ’global citizen’ theme . The most frequent graduate skill , ’global citizen’ ( see Table 1 ) appeared in 12 out of 15 Universities . This was defined as any UKICER 2022 , Sept , 2022 , Dublin , Ireland Rosanne English and Alan Hayes Theme Count Example Graduate At - tributes Global Citizen 12 responsible , global perspective Ethically Aware 11 integrity , cultural understand - ing Critical Thinking 10 imaginative and critical thinker Teamwork 10 effective contributors Communication 8 successful communicators Problem Solving 8 creative problem solvers Subject Specialism 8 knowledgeable in field Adaptable 7 adapts to change , flexible Confidence 7 confident , courageous Life Long Skills 7 risk management , time manage - ment Professional Practi - tioner 7 professionalism , initiative Reflective 7 self - aware , reflective Digital Literacy 5 confident in working with infor - mation Leadership 5 engaged and participatory leader Researcher 5 research skills Analytical 4 investigative , analytical Commercial Aware - ness 4 enterprise awareness IndependentThinkers 4 independent thinkers , self - efficacy Skilled Beyond Dis - cipline 4 interdisciplinary mindset Innovative 3 innovative , future thinking Table 1 : Themes identified from website analysis , their counts and example attributes attribute which referred to an appreciation of society , inclusive of its variety of cultures and diversity . The University of Exeter define to Global Citizenship as a " commitment to actively engage in society , an awareness of sustainability issues , and an understanding of the cultures and view of others in the world , and a desire to further the common good " [ 34 ] . This was seen across other universities in forms such as " world citizens " [ 28 ] and " Globally and locally culturally aware " [ 30 ] . The second most frequent theme was identified as ethical aware - ness ( identified 11 times , equating to 73 . 3 % of Universities ) . Ar - guably interlinked with global citizen , this theme was identified as distinct as some universities had both ”Globally and locally cul - turally aware” and ”Responsible and ethical citizens” emphasising the distinction of the ability to practice in the relevant field in an ethical way . Ethically conscientious perhaps reflects the shift in society towards reducing inequalities and improving quality of liv - ing for all . This shift is reflected in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals which covers aspects such as climate action , responsible production and consumption and reduced inequalities ( see https : / / sdgs . un . org / goals ) . The third most frequent theme was a tie between critical thinking and teamwork each of which occurred 10 times ( equating to 75 % of Universities having this theme ) . Critical thinking and teamwork skills are not unexpected and have been discussed in the related work section . Teamwork was also reflected in the literature , but is one area employers feel satisfied in the ability of recent graduates [ 15 ] . This is likely due to teamwork being well considered and generally incorporated into CS programmes ( [ 10 ] ) . As such , we will initially focus on critical thinking for the discussion . The remaining themes identified in Table 1 are mostly self ex - planatory . The one exception is perhaps digital literacy , which was encompassed attributes such as data skills , confidence in working with information and quantitative skills . This perhaps reflects the increase in big data , and its uses across many areas of our lives . The next section presents initial observations on how some of the more common themes identified can be built into computing science curricula . 5 DISCUSSION As a result of the thematic analysis presented above , we focus on the three most common attribute themes to consider how they could be embedded in a computing context . We do so by drawing on additional literature , including examples from other subjects which evidence graduate attributes but could be applied to CS . This helps begin to address RQ - 2 ( how can the frequent themes be embedded in a CS context ) , though it is recognised that this is a limited exploration which would benefit from further exploration by many researchers . It is recognised that there are a range of possibilities in embedding such skills in a CS context , and these examples provide preliminary approaches which will benefit from further work and refinement . The rest of this section addresses each of professional practitioner , global citizenship and critical thinking in turn , highlighting potential approaches to incorporating these more explicitly into the computing curriculum . 5 . 1 Global Citizenship Global citizenship is an important skill in a modern world . Citizen - ship is reflected in the SQA Higher Computing Science specifica - tion as well as the GCSE Computer Science specification . Students should be respectful of the variety of cultures and diversity , be conscious of sustainability and contribute to the community . This is arguably a challenging aspect to incorporate into com - puting science assessment , however as argued by Yadav et al . it is an important one [ 52 ] . Yadav et al . propose four steps as follows : ( 1 ) collaborate with the community ( 2 ) collect data as citizen scientists ( 3 ) consult on potential solutions with the community ( 4 ) take informed action with the community such as develop - ment of a technical solution This could perhaps be achieved through project courses which emulate charity coding events such as those run by coding for good ( https : / / www . coding4good . net / about ) . Another approach is to explore technical solutions which have citizenship incorporated into their design , e . g . exploring the cit - izenship in electronic voting or blockchain , such as the work by Watanavisit and Vorakulpipat [ 50 ] . Towards Integrated Graduate Skills for UK Computing Science Students UKICER 2022 , Sept , 2022 , Dublin , Ireland Students could also be asked to research and reflect on global citizenship in CS , for example exploring a real world case study on how diversity impacts on computing practice such as bias in AI demonstrated through automated recruitment by Amazon [ 1 ] . Students could also be asked to discuss and reflect on the issues which are demonstrated within such case studies . 5 . 2 Ethically Aware Ethical practice is clearly reflected in BCS accreditation which under 2 . 1 . 13 notes students must be able to ”Recognise the legal , social , ethical , and professional issues involved in the exploitation of computer technology and be guided by the adoption of appropriate professional , ethical and legal practices " [ 2 ] . Within BCS accredited programmes , often a single module can be found which aims to address these elements . Fiesler et al . completed analysis of 115 syllabi on ethics courses within computing science . Their work noted that the prevalence of ethics within computing education research does appear to be increasing , but note that integration with technical aspects of computing and highlighting the issues in - situ is key to success in developing ethical graduates [ 13 ] . Examples of incorporating ethics alongside technical elements includes the work by Bullock et al . who present a module which considers the impact of predictive algorithms [ 6 ] . Henderson also proposes technical exercises in machine learning [ 22 ] . 5 . 3 Critical Thinking Critical thinking is a skill which was identified as lacking in re - cent graduates [ 15 ] , but critical to a strong employee [ 21 ] . This importance is reflected in the position of this skill in our review . Günay et al . presents research on increased critical thinking in software development students by delivering a capstone project which requires development of a solution to a real world problem which currently has no solution [ 20 ] . O’Neill and Hansen presents the re - design of a module to empha - sise critical thinking by asking students to engage in analysis of a problem through creation of computing artefacts such as data anal - ysis , code or statistical analysis [ 42 ] . Of particular note is the use of marking rubrics , which specifically reflect the level of competence demonstrated in skills such as analysis . Rubrics can be useful for assessment of graduate skills such as critical thinking . Given their descriptive nature , this allows be - haviours to be described rather than relying on technical or oth - erwise functional elements for students to achieve . Raj et al . also propose rubrics as helpful for measuring competencies which align with the terminology of graduate skills such as interpersonal com - munication [ 45 ] . Other examples include work by Cicek et al . where the development of a number of rubrics which assess graduate at - tributes within an engineering curriculum [ 8 ] . An additional mechanism which aids in critical thinking and is well documented in computing education is peer review . It has often been used for code review ( see [ 47 ] for a review ) but also for other areas within computing ( e . g . cyber security [ 29 ] ) . 5 . 4 Marking Rubric Example Having identified some mechanisms to incorporate the most fre - quent graduate attribute themes into a computing science curricula , we now present a preliminary example of a marking rubric which demonstrate one approach to evidencing these through assessment . Table 2 provides a subset of the marking scheme for a final year undergraduate exercise focused on analysis of a real world case study which demonstrates how a lack of inclusivity in the devel - opment of software systems can impact society . In particular , the criteria of problem recognition and understanding of social impact aligns with the global citizenship theme . It also provides an exam - ple of incorporating critical analysis , as students were expected to critique sources of information e . g . where sources were unreliable , or inaccurate in their assessment of the incident . It should be noted that this type of exercise can be challenging for students who have more experience of coding and technical exercises . As such , it is im - portant to scaffold students’ learning to enable them to understand what is being asked of them before tackling the assessment . This could be achieved in a number of ways , e . g . critique of a submission from previous cohorts . 6 LIMITATIONS It is worth noting there are potential limitations of this work . It is possible some Universities were identified as having no graduate attributes if they were not shown on a public website . The work also only focuses on Russell Group Universities as a starting point , and thus frequencies when expanding to examine more Universities may be different . This initial work has focused on Russell Group universities , as it provided a more focused list of well established Universities for initial exploration . As a result , the work only reflects the perception of these Universities based on the publicly available information . However other Universities may be more focused on learning and thus may have a different or more defined perspective . It is planned that this research be expanded to be more inclusive of a range of Higher Education Institutions . In terms of the thematic analysis , only two researchers were involved in this process . To increase robustness , this could be re - peated with a larger number of researchers . The impact is that some classifications could be interpreted differently if there were more involved in the analysis . Additionally the initial presentation of ways to embed the most common themes in a CS context draw from existing literature , de - scriptors in the data , and personal practice . It is recognised these are not yet fully refined , and would benefit from more work to ensure a fully robust proposal . However , it is hoped the initial pre - sentation provides a starting point to develop re - usable computing assessment with explicitly embedded graduate skills . 7 CONCLUSION In this paper we have explored the research questions What are the most frequent themes within graduate attributes from UK Russell Group Universities ? and How can the most frequent themes be embed - ded within a CS context ? . To do so , a thematic analysis of graduate attributes of Russell Group Universities was generated . This pro - vided the From this , we identified 20 graduate attribute themes . The top 3 most frequent graduate attribute themes ( global citizenship , ethically aware and critical thinking ) were then explored in relation to embedding within computing science curricula .

Table 2 : A rubric reflecting elements of global citizenship and critical thinking They key outcomes from this paper are the common themes within Russell Group Universities , and the consideration of how these can be incorporated into curricula more explicitly through examples from existing practice and a preliminary marking rubric guide . It is clear from this work and related work ( e . g . [ 10 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 53 ] ) that graduate attributes are a key element of computing science de - grees . The challenge lies in embedding these skills in a meaningful way which aids students students in the development of the skills , thus crossing the skills gap . Whilst we may not be able to ensure appreciation of these skills , we can encourage engagement by use of assessment rubrics which explicitly incorporate the themes . This paper explored three of the most frequent graduate attributes were examined in more depth , with an initial proposal for incorporating global citizenship and critical thinking skills into a rubric . In considering future work in this area , it could be beneficial to develop the set of approaches to embedding graduate skills in CS further as well as establishing practice for the remaining gradu - ate attribute themes identified in this paper . These could then be combined into a framework which computing science educators could use to design CS curricula incorporating the skills identified through this analysis . It may also be valuable to survey computing science student perceptions of these skills , and how they are devel - oped within different institutions , as well as trying to established the effectiveness of including such skills explicitly in assessment .
