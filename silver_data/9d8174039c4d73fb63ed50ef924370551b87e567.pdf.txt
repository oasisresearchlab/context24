Fn is sensitive to mechanical forces in its tandem type III repeats , resulting in extensive molecular enlongation . As such , it has long been hypothesized that cell - and tissue - derived forces may activate an “ integrin switch ” within the critical integrin - binding ninth and 10th type III repeats  conferring di ﬀ erential integrin - binding speci ﬁ city , leading to di ﬀ erential cell responses . Yet , no direct evidence exists to prove the hypothesis nor demonstrate the physiological existence of the switch . We report direct experimental evidence for the Fn integrin switch both in vitro and ex vivo using a scFv engineered to detect the transient , force - induced conformational change , representing an opportunity for detection and targeting of early molecular signatures of cell contractile forces in tissue repair and disease . KEYWORDS : mechano - biology , antibody phage display , integrins , ﬁ bronectin , ﬁ brosis , angiogenesis T he extracellular matrix ( ECM ) forms the complex niche of structural elements surrounding cells in vivo . Cells interact with and are instructed by the ECM via cellular structures known as focal adhesions , large protein complexes composed of transmembrane receptors ( integrins ) and intra - cellular adaptor proteins that mechanically couple the cell ’ s cytoskeleton to ﬁ brillar ECM proteins such as ﬁ bronectin ( Fn ) . Protein − protein interactions within focal adhesions are dynamic ; mechanical forces play important roles for focal adhesion maturation and development , as well as for force - sensitive cell signaling via mechano - sensory proteins . Recent work has shown that conformations of both intracellular focal adhesion constituents ( e . g . , vinculin , integrins ) 1 − 3 as well as extracellular components ( e . g . , Fn ) 4 − 6 are altered by forces transmitted to and from the ECM . In the latter case , previous work from our group and others demonstrates that Fn within the ECM exhibits distinct but unde ﬁ ned altered structural states in response to cellular forces both in vitro and in vivo . 5 , 7 Fn is composed of three types of tandem repeating units , each containing two antiparallel β - sheets . Type I and II repeats are structurally stabilized by disul ﬁ de bonds , whereas type III repeats are stabilized only by hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces , making them sensitive to unfolding due to physiologically relevant forces . 8 − 12 These ﬁ ndings , when coupled with the active role of Fn ’ s ninth and 10th type III repeats ( FnIII9 − 10 ) in mediating integrin - speci ﬁ c interactions , inspired the theory that mechanical forces could trigger a “ switch ” in the integrin - binding pro ﬁ le of Fn . 8 Fn − integrin interactions are known to drive critical cell behaviors and are mediated primarily through the canonical and promiscuous integrin - binding sequence Arg - Gly - Asp ( RGD ) within the 10th type III repeat . 13 A subset of integrins , including integrin α 5 β 1 , Received : April 20 , 2017 Accepted : June 27 , 2017 A r t i c l e www . acsnano . org © XXXX American Chemical Society A DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 7b02755 ACS Nano XXXX , XXX , XXX − XXX is additionally dependent on the sequence motif PHSRN within the neighboring ninth type III repeat . 14 − 17 Integrin speci ﬁ city to Fn can be modulated in vitro by altering the structural stability of the integrin - binding domain ( i . e . , the ninth and 10th type III repeats ) via directed mutation , 18 resulting in the regulation of developmentally and pathologically relevant cell di ﬀ erentiation pathways 19 , 20 and , importantly , cellular re - sponses to microenvironmental mechanics ( e . g . , sti ﬀ ness ) . 21 Despite these ﬁ ndings , the integrin switch theory and its potential relevance to biological processes in vivo remain unde ﬁ ned . To prove the existence of Fn ’ s integrin switch and to demonstrate its relevance in vivo , we sought to develop single - chain antibodies ( scFv ) capable of detecting a ∼ 1 nm extension in the conformation of Fn ’ s integrin - binding domain through directed evolution and screening against recombinant Fn fragments that mimic the force - induced structural states predicted in silico . Engineered Fn fragments spanning the ninth and 10th type III repeats of Fn were produced as reported , 20 in which a Leu 1408 Pro mutation 18 was created to stabilize the spatial and angular orientation of PHSRN with respect to RGD ( denoted FnIII9 * 10 ) .

FnIII9 * 10 , represents a stabilized native structure through a Leu - to - Pro point mutation at position 1408 . In this conformation , the PHSRN - to - RGD distance is approximately 36 Å . FnIII9 − 4G - 10 is a mutation of the FnII9 * 10 variant that contains a 4xGly insertion between the 9th and 10th type III repeats . This mutation increases domain separation and the PHSRN - to - RGD distance to approximately 43 Å . These fragments have been employed in the past to predict potential biological consequences of the theorized integrin switch . B ) SPR binding characterization of integrins α 5 β 1 and α V β 3 to the FnIII9 * 10 and FnIII9 − 4G - 10 fragments demonstrate a nearly complete loss of binding of α 5 β 1 upon domain separation , whereas α v β 3 binding is predictably una ﬀ ected .

ACS Nano Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 7b02755 ACS Nano XXXX , XXX , XXX − XXX B conformation variant was created by inserting a 4 - glycine ( 4G ) linker between the ninth and 10th type III repeats , increasing the separation between the PHSRN and RGD sites from 3 . 4 nm to approximately 4 . 3 nm ( denoted FnIII9 - 4G - 10 ; Figure 1A ) . Surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) experiments demon - strate that the insertion of the 4G linker is su ﬃ cient to decrease in vitro α 5 β 1 integrin - binding a ﬃ nity from 12 nM to ∼ 2 . 5 μ M , whereas integrin α v β 3 a ﬃ nity predictably remains relatively constant at ∼ 40 nM ( Figure 1B ) . Immuno ﬂ uorescence staining of integrins on human foreskin ﬁ broblasts cultured on these Fn fragments con ﬁ rms that this molecular modi ﬁ cation results in a switch in the integrin - binding pro ﬁ le from α 5 β 1 and α v β 3 to predominantly α v β 3 at the cellular level ( Figure 1C and Supporting Information Figure S1 ) , supporting earlier reports of FnIII9 * 10 fragment ’ s ability to engage α 5 β 1 integrins preferentially . 20 Cell adhesion assays were additionally performed on decellularized Fn - rich ECMs formed on elastic PDMS membranes , which enable arti ﬁ cial straining or relaxing . Cells exclusively expressing α 5 β 1 integrin 22 adhere to a lesser extent on strained Fn ECMs compared to relaxed , whereas cells exclusively expressing α v β 3 do not exhibit di ﬀ erential adhesion ( Figure 1D , E ) . The overall enhanced adhesion of cells expressing α 5 β 1 is likely due to binding the PHSRN sequence , which enhances cell adhesion over binding of RGD alone . 16 Furthermore , the decreased adhesion of cells exclusively expressing α v β 3 could be due to the transfection e ﬃ ciency of Figure 2 . H5 antibody recognizes conformational change of the integrin - binding domain by binding an epitope speci ﬁ cally on the ninth type III repeat that can be exposed by denaturation . ( A , B ) SPR analysis of binding of H5 antibody to recombinant FnIII9 * 10 ( A ) and FnIII9 - 4G - 10 ( B ) fragments demonstrates the conformation selectivity of its binding . H5 binds preferentially to the molecularly extended conformation . Black lines show experimental sensogram traces , and red lines show ﬁ tted data . Equilibrium dissociation constants ( K D ) are shown above the curves . ( C ) Competitive binding of the H5 antibody to FnIII9 - 4G - 10 in the presence of soluble FnIII9 ( FnIII6 - 9 ) and FnIII10 ( FnIII10 - 14 ) fragments . FnIII9 - 4G - 10 was immobilized on ELISA plates , and the H5 antibody was co - incubated with the indicated soluble Fn fragments prior to incubation with FnIII9 - 4G - 10 . N = 8 for each group ; error bars re ﬂ ect SEM . ( D , E ) Domain mapping studies were performed by SPR using Fn fragments including either the ninth type III repeat ( FnIII6 - 9 ) ( B ) or the 10th type III repeat ( FnIII10 - 14 ) ( C ) . Binding of H5 was only observed by SPR when fragments including the ninth Fn type III repeat were immobilized , suggesting that the epitope for H5 is located within FnIII9 . ( F ) ELISA of H5 binding to full - length Fn and Fn fragments . H5 bound increasingly to increasing amounts of surface - adsorbed FnIII9 - 4G - 10 to a signi ﬁ cantly greater degree than FnIII9 * 10 or full - length Fn at all concentrations ( p < 0 . 0001 ) ( two - way ANOVA with Tukey ’ s post - test , N = 3 ) . ( G , H ) Nitrocellulose dot blot ( G ) and Western blot ( H ) of H5 binding to full - length Fn and Fn fragments .

In the ELISA , HFN7 . 1 only bound FnIII9 - 4G - 10 to a signi ﬁ cantly greater degree than FnIII9 * 10 at 1 μ M ( p < 0 . 05 ) and was not signi ﬁ cant at higher concentrations ( two - way ANOVA with Tukey ’ s post - test , N = 3 ) . HFN7 . 1 did not show preferential a ﬃ nity for FnIII9 * 10 or FnIII9 - 4G - 10 in the dot blot or Western blot . ACS Nano Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 7b02755 ACS Nano XXXX , XXX , XXX − XXX C the ITGAV vector into CHO B2 cells , which do not naturally express α 5 or α v . By contrast , the CHO K1 cells endogenously express hamster α 5 β 1 integrin . 22 Taken together , these results support the hypothesis of a force - sensitive “ integrin switch ” in Fn ﬁ bers , yet fall short of demonstrating a speci ﬁ c conforma - tional change in the integrin - binding domain . By performing phage display panning and selection using scFv antibody libraries 23 , 24 on the recombinant Fn fragments FnIII9 * 10 and FnIII9 - 4G - 10 , we were able to isolate speci ﬁ c scFv with both high binding a ﬃ nities and discrimination between the two model Fn fragments . Forty antibody clones were isolated , and eight were carried forward for subsequent validation . Clone H5 displayed high selectivity toward the extended ( FnIII9 - 4G - 10 ) , but not the native , stabilized ( FnIII9 * 10 ) conformation ( Supporting Information Figure S2 ) . H5 binding kinetics were evaluated using SPR ( Figure 2A , B ) . Equilibrium dissociation constants ( K D ) were determined to be 107 nM for H5 binding to FnIII9 * 10 and 16 nM for binding to FnIII9 - 4G - 10 . Selectivity of H5 binding to the FnIII9 - 4G - 10 fragment was thus approximately an order of magnitude greater compared to that of FnIII9 - 10 . Competitive ELISAs of H5 binding to FnIII9 - 4G - 10 in the presence of increasing concentrations of soluble Fn fragments displaying only the ninth ( FnIII6 - 9 ) or 10th ( FnIII10 - 14 ) type III repeats demonstrated that increasing concentrations of FnIII6 - 9 blocked binding of H5 to Fn9 - 4G - 10 , which was not observed with increasing concentrations of FnIII10 - 14 ( Figure 2C ) . Additionally , SPR analysis of H5 binding to these fragments revealed that the equilibrium dissociation constant ( K D ) for H5 binding to FnIII6 - 9 was 34 . 8 nM , a higher a ﬃ nity interaction than H5 binding to FnIII10 - 14 ( 5 . 1 μ M ; Figure 2D , E ) . Together these data indicate that H5 ’ s epitope is located within Fn ’ s ninth type III repeat . Binding characteristics of H5 to Fn and the Fn fragments were then evaluated by Western blot analysis in parallel with a commercially available control antibody clone ( HFN7 . 1 ) against Fn ’ s integrin - binding domain ( Figure 2F − K ) . The increased a ﬃ nity of H5 to FnIII9 - 4G - 10 versus FnIII9 * 10 is observed in ELISA but not in dot blots or traditional denaturing Western blots , suggesting that the Figure 3 . H5 antibody is capable of discriminating conformational changes of Fn ’ s integrin - binding domain ( i . e . , the integrin switch ) in multiple model systems . ( A ) Staining of H5 on in vitro Fn ﬁ bers deposited on PDMS membranes demonstrates the strain - dependent conformation of Fn ’ s integrin - binding domain .

( C ) Furthermore , the conformation of Fn ’ s integrin - binding domain within primary lung ﬁ broblast - laden Fn - rich ECM is sensitive to modulation of ﬁ broblast contractility through agonists ( TGF - β ) and inhibitors ( blebbistatin ) . Scale bar , 50 μ m . ACS Nano Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 7b02755 ACS Nano XXXX , XXX , XXX − XXX D epitope bound by H5 is likely a linear peptide sequence and not a more complex 3D structure . We hypothesized that if H5 bound to the open ( or “ o ﬀ ” ) state of the switch that it should selectively inhibit α v β 3 − Fn interactions as the antibody only weakly recognizes the closed / “ on ” α 5 β 1 - binding conformation . Standard cell attachment assays to Fn - adsorbed substrates , which present multiple conformations of Fn due to surface - mediated unfolding , con ﬁ rm the H5 clone selectively inhibits Fn − integrin α v β 3 , but not α 5 β 1 , interactions with Fn ( Supporting Information Figure S3 ) . Validation of H5 ’ s recognition to FnIII9 and its selective inhibition of α v β 3 binding to Fn - adsorbed surfaces led us to use the H5 clone to test the hypothesis that Fn ’ s integrin - binding domain displays a force - induced conformational change ( i . e . , extension ) when Fn ﬁ bers are mechanically strained . Manually deposited Fn ﬁ bers on micropatterned and stretched PDMS membranes display unfolding of Fn ’ s type III repeats , demonstrated by the exposure of cryptic cysteines . 5 , 6 , 25 Using this system , the binding of H5 to Fn ﬁ bers under increasing strain was found to display switch - like behavior , with H5 signal increasing signi ﬁ cantly at an extension ratio of ∼ 1 . 4 − 1 . 5 , and plateauing at additional strain ( Figure 3A ) . This discrete signature suggests an abrupt transition from a native folded to extended conformation upon the application of tensile force . Similarly , on decellularized Fn - rich ECMs assembled on elastic PDMS membranes ( Figure 3B ) , H5 was able to both globally discriminate strained from relaxed Fn ECMs and locally discriminate between ﬁ bers in both a relaxed and strained ECM . H5 staining intensity of Fn - rich ECM also correlated strongly with the contractile state of resident ﬁ broblasts , as induced by the addition of contractility agonists ( TGF - β ) or inhibitors ( blebbistatin ) , suggesting that cell - generated forces are su ﬃ cient to activate the integrin switch ( Figure 3C ) . We then used H5 to probe Fn integrin - binding domain conformations within native tissues . Stained tissues from two model systems were used : a mouse model of pulmonary ﬁ brosis 26 , 27 and a mouse model of postnatal retinal angio - genesis . Using frozen tissue sections from saline control and bleomycin - treated ﬁ brotic mouse lungs , staining of H5 , but not a negative control scFv , localized to ﬁ brillar Fn ( assessed using a polyclonal anti - Fn antibody ) within the ECM ( Figure 4 and Supporting Information Figure S4 ) . Ratiometric image analysis revealed that the H5 staining patterns within these lung samples were spatially distinct , suggesting distinct conforma - tional states of Fn within the matrix . Notably , the ﬁ brotic time points ( 2 − 8 weeks ) show areas of high H5 / Fn ratio , correlating with the severity of ﬁ brosis observed in the corresponding H & E staining . By week 10 , at which point the ﬁ brosis is resolved , the H5 / Fn ratio resembles that of the saline control . H5 was also used to probe the Fn - rich ECM during postnatal retinal vascularization . The retinas of newborn mice are avascular but become vascularized in a reproducible manner over the ﬁ rst 10 days after birth . 28 During angiogenesis , migration of endothelial tip cells is guided by ﬁ bronectin ﬁ bers deposited by the astrocytic network . 29 H5 / Fn ratio was observed to be increased at the ﬁ lopodia of tip cells , suggesting that cell - generated forces during vascular expansion is su ﬃ cient to alter the conformation of the integrin - binding domain of surrounding Fn ﬁ bers . In contrast , H5 showed minimal staining in regions of mature vessels ( Figure 5 ) . These combined results both demonstrate the in vivo existence and activation of the long - theorized Fn conforma - tional switch within the integrin - binding domain and suggest its in ﬂ uence in skewing integrin speci ﬁ city in both developmental processes , as well as in pathological tissue ﬁ brosis . H5 thus represents an attractive approach to detecting and targeting key developmental and disease processes . Reports have suggested that the relative separation distance between the “ synergy ” PHSRN sequence in the ninth Fn type III repeat and the RGD site in the 10th Fn type III repeat is critical for engagement and activation of integrin α 5 β 1 20 and α 3 β 1 , 30 with an optimal PHSRN - RGD distance of 3 . 7 nm for high a ﬃ nity integrin α 5 β 1 engagement . 31 Furthermore , recent ﬁ ndings from the Smith group demonstrate that Fn ﬁ ber extension decreases cell spreading and adhesion , 32 suggesting a mechanism by which Fn strain regulates the a ﬃ nity of cell surface receptors , such as integrins , involved in cell adhesion . These observations led us to strive for the development of a molecular probe that would help prove the long - standing Figure 4 . Fn ’ s integrin mechano - switch displays spatially distinct patterns of activation in a model of resolving lung ﬁ brosis . ( A − D ) Mouse lung tissue sections ( scale bar = 50 μ m ) were immunostained for H5 ( red ) , Fn ( green ) , and DNA ( blue ) at the indicated time points after bleomycin - induced ﬁ brotic injury . In this model , bleomycin induces ﬁ brosis by 14 − 21 days , and is typically resolved by 56 days . H5 / Fn ratio images displaying the heterogeneity of Fn ﬁ ber conformation within the ECM at the tissue scale are shown , along with H & E staining of a corresponding serial section at the same time points . The early repair ( B ) and ﬁ brotic ( C ) time points show areas of higher H5 / Fn ratio , indicating the unfolding of Fn ’ s integrin - binding domain , perhaps indicative of active ﬁ brosis . By resolution ( D ) , the H5 / Fn ratiometric image resembles that of the saline control .

The development of conformation - speci ﬁ c antibodies by phage display is well - established , as work by Lefkowitz and co - workers have used phage display to isolate a conformation speci ﬁ c Fab to activated β - arrestin - 1 . 33 Yet , the speci ﬁ c challenges of our goal were that ( 1 ) the conformational change of the integrin - binding domain is due to the application of force , ( 2 ) the application of force to Fn ﬁ bers leads to multiple conformational changes along the length of the 440 kDa protein that are impossible to distinguish , and ( 3 ) the conformational change is highly labile due to the ability of Fn type III repeats to refold in the absence of force . Here , we utilized predicted structures from steered molecular dynamics simulations coupled with molecular engineering to produce a mimetic of the strained integrin - binding domain in order to perform phage display to discover the H5 clone . It is likely that the two model Fn fragments di ﬀ er not only in separation between RGD and PHSRN but also in relative conformational stability . FnIII9 * 10 is stabilized by a Leu1408Pro mutation between FnIII9 and FnIII10 , 18 whereas FnIII - 4G - 10 is separated by a 4 - glycine linker between the two domains . Polyglycine sequences are commonly used in the design of ﬂ exible linker regions . 34 In this context , the ﬂ exibility conferred by the 4 - glycine linker may recapitulate the inherent sensitivity of FnIII repeats to force - mediated unfolding . 8 − 12 One application of the H5 scFv could be to probe pathologic ECMs , speci ﬁ cally tumor stroma and ﬁ brotic ECMs which contain highly contractile myo ﬁ broblasts . Recent reports suggest that α v integrins on myo ﬁ broblasts are implicated in ﬁ brogenesis in a broad range of ﬁ brotic diseases , and that pharmacological blockade of α v integrins ameliorates liver and lung ﬁ brosis . 35 The data regarding H5 staining of bleomycin - treated lungs are particularly interesting in the context of idiopathic pulmonary ﬁ brosis ( IPF ) , a fatal form of progressive lung ﬁ brosis in humans . The lungs of IPF patients are mechanically and biochemically heterogeneous , with areas of soft , normal lung tissue and sti ﬀ er regions of mature ﬁ brosis . The H5 scFv may be used to delineate regions of high ECM strain that also present an enhanced α v integrin - binding character due to the conformation of the integrin - binding domain , perhaps indicative of ongoing ﬁ brosis . The ability of the H5 antibody to extract structural information from the ECM was also demonstrated in a model of retinal angiogenesis , the process by which new blood vessels form by from endothelial sprouting . 36 In mouse tissue sections , regions of high H5 / Fn ratio were found at the extensions of endothelial tip cells , suggesting that Fn is unfolded in these regions . Fn is known to be a mediator of retinal angiogenesis , wherein astrocytes deposit ﬁ bronectin prior to di ﬀ erentiation of angioblasts to endothelial cells . 29 Our results build on this foundation by suggesting that forces from endothelial tip cells unfold Fn , presenting an α v β 3 binding character within the provisional matrix that may in ﬂ uence the formation of new blood vessels , a result further supported by the work of Segura et al . 37 using engineered Fn fragments of the integrin - binding domain in reparative angiogenesis . We have developed a conformation - sensitive single - chain antibody ( clone H5 ) to the integrin - binding FnIII9 - 10 domain of Fn and demonstrated its mechano - sensitive binding to Fn in multiple model systems in vitro and ex vivo . We believe these force - sensitive conformational changes observed in the integrin - binding domain of Fn are evidence of the long theorized Fn “ integrin - switch ” which likely regulate integrin - speci ﬁ c cell responses based on controlling the presentation and accessi - bility of Fn epitopes in vivo and in engineered contexts . We also believe that H5 speci ﬁ cally detects a force - induced conforma - tional change within a protein . As mechanics of tissues are becoming increasingly implicated in pathogenesis of ﬁ brotic diseases , there is a nascent opportunity to explore targeting the mechano - chemical character of ECM as a paradigm for tissue imaging and disease diagnosis .
