Weitz , Harvard University , Cambridge , MA , and approved January 10 , 2017 ( received for review September 28 , 2016 ) The actin cytoskeleton is a critical regulator of cytoplasmic architec - ture and mechanics , essential in a myriad of physiological processes . Here we demonstrate a liquid phase of actin filaments in the presence of the physiological cross - linker , filamin . Filamin condenses short actin filaments into spindle - shaped droplets , or tactoids , with shape dynamics consistent with a continuum model of anisotropic liquids . We find that cross - linker density controls the droplet shape and deformation timescales , consistent with a variable interfacial tension and viscosity . Near the liquid – solid transition , cross - linked actin bundles show behaviors reminiscent of fluid threads , including capillary instabilities and contraction . These data reveal a liquid droplet phase of actin , demixed from the sur - rounding solution and dominated by interfacial tension . These re - sults suggest a mechanism to control organization , morphology , and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton . actin | phase separation | liquid crystal | cytoskeleton T he cellular cytoplasm is a hierarchical array of diverse , soft materials assembled from biological molecules that work in concert to support cell physiology ( 1 ) . The actin cytoskeleton constitutes a spectrum of materials constructed from the semi - flexible polymer actin ( F - actin ) that are crucial in diverse phys - ical processes ranging from cell division and migration to tissue morphogenesis ( 2 , 3 ) . Cross - linking and regulatory proteins as - semble actin filaments into bundles and networks with varied composition , mechanics , and physiological function ( 4 ) . The mechanical properties of actin assemblies regulate force gener - ation and transmission to dynamically control morphogenic processes from the subcellular to tissue length scales ( 5 , 6 ) . A mechanistic understanding of cytoplasmic mechanics is obscured by the rich complexity of in vivo cytoskeletal assemblies ( 7 ) and has been investigated via in vitro model systems ( 8 , 9 ) . Vastly different material properties have been accessed through varying filament length , concentration , and cross - linking . For sem - idilute concentrations of long actin filaments ( > 1 μ m ) , the mean spacing between actin filaments , or mesh size , is much smaller than the filament length . In this case , cross - linking proteins mechanically constrain actin filaments to result in space - spanning networks that are viscoelastic gels ( 10 ) . The structure of cross - linked actin networks is kinetically determined , reflecting a metastable state ( 11 , 12 ) that requires motor - driven stresses for significant shape changes ( 13 ) . In contrast , highly concentrated solutions of short actin filaments ( < 1 μ m ) align due to entropic effects and form equilibrium liquid crystal phases ( 14 ) . Liquid crystal theory has been introduced as a framework to understand actin cortex mechanics and mitotic spindle shape ( 5 , 15 ) , but the existence of liquid crystal - like phases at physiological conditions is uncertain . Liquid - like phases of proteins and nucleic acids have been found within the cytoplasm and are thought to be important in subcellular organization ( 16 ) . Weak and transient interactions trigger these biomolecules to phase separate from the cytoplasm into droplets , with shape and dynamics dominated by interfacial tension and viscosity ( 16 ) . Here we demonstrate liquid droplets comprised of cross - linked , short actin filaments . We focus on dilute actin concentrations where cross - linkers are critical to induce phase separation of actin into droplets with tunable tac - toid shape . Consistent with a liquid composed of rods , we can describe the droplet shape and dynamics with an anisotropic liquid continuum model . Finally , we demonstrate actin bundles that exhibit shape changes reminiscent of fluid threads , with interfacial tension driven pearling and shortening . This reveals a liquid droplet phase of actin , demixed from the surrounding solution , with shape dominated by interfacial tension . Results Liquid Droplets Formed by Short Actin Filaments Cross - Linked by Filamin . We polymerize actin filaments beginning with a dilute ( 2 . 6 μ M ) suspension of actin monomers in the presence of cap - ping protein , which limits filament growth ( 17 ) . Under these conditions , the average distance between filaments , or mesh size , is ∼ 1 μ m ( 18 ) and much larger than the average F - actin length , ∼ 180 nm , such that filaments freely diffuse and form a uniform , isotropic mixture ( Fig . 1 A , Left ; SI Text ; and Movie S1 ) . Adding 0 . 26 μ M of the F - actin cross - linker filamin ( 19 ) triggers sudden density changes in the mixture . Actin filaments rapidly assemble into spindle - shaped aggregates of high density , estimated to be 250 - μ M monomeric actin ; a negligible density of filaments re - main in the bulk ( Fig . 1 B , Left ) . The tactoids grow over time , increasing in length from ∼ 1 to 4 μ m during the first 60 min after filamin addition ( Fig . 1 A and Movie S1 ) . These aggregates have a characteristic spindle shape , mathe - matically described as a tactoid , which is a signature shape of liquid crystal droplets ( 20 ) . Liquid crystal phases form in highly Significance The interior of biological cells is composed of soft , macromo - lecular - based materials . The semiflexible biopolymer actin cross - links into networks and bundles with diverse architec - tures to form the actin cytoskeleton . Actin networks have been traditionally thought to be viscoelastic gels , whose rigidity controls cell morphogenesis . Here we demonstrate that cross - linked actin filaments also form liquid droplets . Because these liquids are composed of rod - like polymers , they form aniso - tropic liquid droplets with a spindle - like shape , whose mor - phology can be controlled by cross - link concentration . Actin - based liquid bundles also display shape instabilities character - istic of fluids . These shape dynamics reveal a mechanism to control subcellular compartmentalization and dynamics , with implications for mitotic spindle shape and molecular motor - independent contractility .

For actin fila - ments of the length in our experiments , these phases occur at concentrations of ∼ 250 μ M ( 23 ) ( SI Text ) . Here we find that filamin induces the formation of tactoids at 100 - fold lower actin concentration . In further contrast to traditional liquid crystal tactoids , cross - linked tactoids are surrounded by an undetectably low concentration of F - actin ( Fig . 1 B , Left ) . To probe whether cross - linked actin tactoids are fluid , we in - vestigate the actin filament mobility via fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( Fig . 1 C , images , and Movie S2 ) . After photobleaching a region of the tactoid , the F - actin fluorescence intensity recovers in the bleached region , suggesting that fila - ments rearrange within the tactoid ( Fig . 1 C and Fig . S1 ) . We quantify the recovery by plotting the ratio of the fluorescence intensity on the bleached side to the unbleached side as a function of time . The increasing intensity ratio with time is fit to a rising exponential , yielding a recovery time of τ R ∼ 900 s . From this , we estimate a diffusion coefficient of D ∼ 0 . 3 × 10 − 2 μ m 2 / s and a viscosity , η ∼ 3 Pa · s ( SI Text ) , comparable to viscosities reported in other protein and colloid systems ( 24 ) . We observe tactoids over a range of actin filament lengths ( 0 . 1 – 1 μ m ) and filamin concentrations ( 1 – 10 mol % ) ( Fig . 1 D ) . At longer filament lengths , we observe the formation of space - spanning actin networks , which have a viscoelasticity that has been well studied ( 25 ) . At extremely low filament lengths or cross - link concentrations , tactoids do not form , and actin fila - ments freely diffuse in solution , analogous to a gas phase . Tactoid Shape Can Be Modulated by Filament Cross - Linking . Thus far , we have only observed tactoid formation with filamin . Cross - links are typically thought of as interacting with the filaments in an anisotropic fashion , by promoting actin filament alignment .

However , filamin is a long ( ∼ 150 nm ) and flexible actin cross - linker , with transient binding kinetics ( 19 ) . This may allow for a less orientationally constrained , long - range attractive interaction between filaments . Thus , cross - links may serve as a source of isotropic or anisotropic cohesion between filaments . To explore this , we form tactoids with variable filamin concentration from 2 . 5 to 15 mol % ( Fig . 2 A , images and open circles ) . We describe the resulting tactoid shape by the aspect ratio , L / r , where L and r are the major and minor axes lengths , respectively . At low fila - min concentration , tactoids are elongated ( L / r ∼ 3 for 2 . 5 mol % filamin ) . Strikingly , we find that as the concentration of filamin cross - links increases , the tactoid aspect ratio decreases ( L / r ∼ 2 for 15 mol % filamin ) . To understand tactoid shape , we model the tactoid as a fluid droplet using a continuum theory ( SI Text ) . An ordinary liquid droplet has purely isotropic interfacial tension , and the optimal equilibrium shape is a sphere ( Fig . 2 B ) . In contrast , a liquid crystal droplet is made of anisotropic particles , which gives rise to an anisotropic interfacial tension ( 21 ) . A collection of rods with purely anisotropic interactions would have a preferred equilibrium shape of a cylinder ( Fig . 2 B ) , with a tendency of rod - like particles to align with the interface . Thus , we model a tactoid as a droplet with both isotropic , γ I , and anisotropic , γ A , interfacial tension components ( 20 , 21 ) ( SI Text and Fig . S2 ) . The optimal shape of the droplet is determined by minimizing the interfacial energy , controlled by a single dimensionless parameter , ω = γ A / γ I . The balance of anisotropic and isotropic interfacial tensions yields elongated shapes for ω > 0 , which become increasingly elongated as ω grows and sharp features emerge for ω > 1 ( Fig . 2 C ) . We calculate ω from the experimentally observed aspect ratios using the theoretical relation L = r = 2 ω 1 = 2 for ω ≥ 1 ( 20 ) ( SI Text ) . We observe that ω is inversely proportional to filamin concen - tration ( Fig . 2 A , diamonds ) . Thus , filamin alters ω such that the relative contribution of isotropic interfacial tension increases with respect to the anisotropic interfacial tension . This indicates that filamin serves primarily as cohesion between F - actin , rather than to enforce F - actin alignment within droplets . Cross - Link Concentration Modulates Tactoid Shape Dynamics . Over 100 min , the average tactoid length increases as a power law , L ∼ t α , where α = 0 . 47 ± 0 . 01 ( Fig . 3 A , dashed , and Movie S3 ) . Notably , as the average size increases , the tactoid aspect ratio remains constant ( Fig . 3 A , open squares ) . This is consistent with theory and experiments on tactoids with homogeneous nematic alignment ( 26 , 27 ) ( SI Text ) . Tactoid growth likely occurs via coarsening mechanisms as - sociated with conventional liquid droplets , including Ostwald ripening and droplet coalescence ( 28 ) . At the earliest observed stages of tactoid formation , there is a negligible concentration of F - actin in the bulk . This suggests that tactoid growth via single filament accretion , or Ostwald ripening , is unlikely . Instead , we observe individual coalescence events where two initially sepa - rate tactoids merge into a single elongated droplet that relaxes , within minutes , into a larger tactoid ( Fig . 3 B , images , and Movie S4 ) . Moreover , the scaling exponent we measure in growth dy - namics is consistent with that expected for coarsening of iso - tropic liquid droplets via interfacial tension - driven coalescence ( α = 0 . 5 ) ( 28 ) . As a further test that liquid properties dominate tactoid growth via coalescence , we probe the droplet deformation dy - namics . We measure the tactoid length , L , along the major axis , over time as two initially separate tactoids coalesce ( Fig . 3 B ) . After initial coalescence ( L = L i ) , the length rapidly decreases as the merged droplet shape relaxes toward a steady - state tactoid shape with L = L f . The length shortening is consistent with an exponential decay from which we extract a single characteristic relaxation time , τ , using L ( t ) = L f + ( L i − L f ) exp ( − t / τ ) , where τ is a characteristic relaxation time ( Fig . 3 B , line ) . Data from mul - tiple coalescence events collapse onto a single master curve upon rescaling the length by the deformation length , L i − L f , and time by τ ( Fig . 3 C ) .

From the model , we calculate τ as a function of η / γ I for varying values of ω = γ A / γ I ( Fig . 3 D , dashed lines ) . We find that τ obtained from experimental data for 5 and 10 mol % filamin is consistent with those predicted for ω = 2 and 1 . 4 ( values corresponding to those in Fig . 2 A ) , respectively ( Fig . 3 D , symbols ) . Thus , the shape dynamics during droplet co - alescence events can be quantitatively described with a contin - uum fluid model containing both isotropic and anisotropic interfacial tensions . From the η / γ I obtained in the fit ( Table S1 ) , and the viscosity estimated from photobleaching , we estimate γ I ∼ 300 nN / m . This interfacial tension is ∼ 10 times less than reported for other protein - based liquid droplets ( 24 , 29 ) but consistent with theoretical predictions for larger particles such as actin filaments ( 21 ) . Consistent with coalescence in isotropic droplets , we observe a linear scaling when we plot the relaxation time , τ , as a function of the deformation length , L i − L f , from the exponential fits ( Fig . 3 C , Inset ) . The slope of the line is η / γ eff , where γ eff is an effective interfacial tension with contributions from both γ I and γ A ( SI Text ) . The data from the two different filamin concentrations fall on the same line , suggesting that that cross - link density modifies viscosity and the effective in - terfacial tension proportionally . Together , the droplet shape and dynamics demonstrate that filamin cross - link concentra - tion modulates both the interfacial tensions and the viscosity of F - actin droplets . Interfacial Tension Drives Pearling and Contraction of Bundles . Actin bundles formed with passive cross - linkers are typically thought to be kinetically trapped structures with few structural rearrange - ments at long times ( 12 ) . However , our findings suggest that when the actin filaments are sufficiently short , we may be able to observe bundles displaying fluid - like behavior . We explore this in our system by constructing bundles near the liquid – solid boundary ( Fig . 1 D ) .

After rapid assembly , these bundles continue to change shape over ∼ 10 min timescales . Some bundles develop pearling instabilities along their length that evolve into periodically spaced bulges , which grow circumferentially in time ( Fig . 4 A and Movie S5 ) . Such behavior is characteristic of a Rayleigh – Plateau instability observed in fluid columns , where interfacial tension drives the growth of periodic bulges that arise from fluctuations ( SI Text and Fig . S3 ) . In contrast to simple fluids , where capillary instabilities result in droplet breakup ( 30 ) , we observe instabil - ities that evolve into chains of tactoids bridged by thin bundles . This is reminiscent of polymer fluids , where droplet breakup is arrested by polymer entanglements in the thinning bridges ( 31 ) ( SI Text ) . The characteristic length scale of pearling is longer than that expected from a simple fluid , consistent with our the - oretical model based on anisotropic interfacial tension ( SI Text ) . We also observe bundles that contract ( Fig . 4 B and Movies S6 and S7 ) . The bundle length , L ( t ) shortens exponentially in time , reducing in length by 20 – 60 % over ∼ 10 min ( Fig . 4 C ) toward a tactoid shape . This length contraction is captured by our dynamic continuum model of a droplet relaxing to its equilibrium shape ( SI Text and Fig . 4 C ) . Upon rescaling L ( t ) by deformation length , L i − L f , and time by the relaxation time , τ , we find that bundles across a range of cross - linking concentrations collapse onto a single exponential decay ( Fig . 4 D ) . This suggests that contracting bundles are also liquid columns that relax to their equilibrium shapes with a characteristic timescale . We find that the extent of cross - linking provides a tunable parameter to modulate bundle contractile strain and strain rates ( Fig . 4 E ) . Thus , if cross - linked F - actin bundles are fluidized , interfacial tension is sufficient to drive their contractility . Discussion The experimental characterization of cytoskeletal liquid crystal phases is a nascent field ( 15 , 23 , 32 , 33 ) . Here we describe a liquid crystal droplet , induced by the addition of cross - links and phase separated from a dilute suspension of anisotropic parti - cles . We find that the physiological cross - linker filamin cross - links short F - actin into liquid crystalline droplets at concentra - tions 100 - fold less than the critical concentration expected for entropic ordering . In this unusual , cross - linked liquid crystal , cross - linkers provide attractive interactions , allowing for the modulation of liquid properties such as interfacial tension and viscosity . The liquid phase is likely supported by filamin ’ s bio - physical properties : filamin is a long ( ∼ 150 nm ) and flexible actin cross - linker , with transient binding kinetics ( 19 ) . We hypothesize that these cross - link properties are crucial to allowing filament orientational and translational mobility to support a liquid A B 1 ' 2 ' 3 ' 4 ' 6 ' 8 ' 0 ' 5 ' 7 ' 9 ' 11 ' 13 ' 3 ' 1 ' 0 ' 15 ' 5 μ m 5 μ m L f L i 1 . 0 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 0 500 1000 1500 t ( s ) L ( t ) / L i 2 . 5 % 10 . 0 % C D 0 . 6 0 . 5 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 2 C on t r a c t il e s t r a i n 2 . 5 5 . 0 10 . 0 Filamin ( % ) 2 . 5 % 5 . 0 % 10 . 0 % 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 t / τ ( L ( t ) - L f ) / ( L i - L f ) E Fig . 4 .

Understanding the molecular mechanisms to control macromolecular liquid phases is an exciting avenue of future research . Evidence of liquid phases of cross - linked biopolymers in vitro potentially has significant implications for cytoskeletal architec - ture and mechanics . Liquid crystal physics has been invoked to describe the meiotic spindle shape ( 15 ) and actomyosin flows ( 5 ) . Cross - linked biopolymer tactoids provide a minimal model sys - tem to explore biopolymer liquid crystals . Our data provide ev - idence for a liquid crystal description of spindle shape ( 15 , 34 , 35 ) , physical properties ( 15 ) , and scaling with system size ( 36 ) . These results suggest that liquid crystal theory has the potential to describe diverse biopolymer assemblies beyond the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton , including amyloid fibrils , intermediate filaments , and bacterial homologs of actin and microtubules . Transitions between solid and liquid phases change the un - derlying physical properties of materials . Regulatory proteins in vivo provide dynamic control of biopolymer filament length and cross - link affinity , which could potentially drive the system between a gel and liquid phase to alter bundle mechanics and shape . Most notably , we find that bundles of fluid cross - linked filaments relax their shape by contracting , without requiring molecular motor activity . These results demonstrate that in - terfacial tension is sufficient to drive shortening and shape in - stabilities of bundles , suggesting a mechanism for previously reported motor - independent contraction in cells ( 37 ) . Future research will elucidate the extent to which liquid phases of bio - polymer filaments organize the interior of living cells and how such biological structures can inform novel soft materials design .
