Introduction protein kinase D ( pKD ) isoforms are diacylglycerol ( Dag ) and pro - tein kinase c ( pKc ) effectors that mediate the actions of hormones , growth factors , neurotransmitters and other stimuli that activate phospholipase c ( plc ) β and γ ( rozengurt et al , 2005 ; Wang , 2006 ) . three mammalian genes encode homologous , widely expressed pKD1 , pKD2 and pKD3 proteins , although the level of individual pKDs varies between tissues . activated pKDs associ - ate with organelle surfaces—plasma and golgi membranes , and mito chondria—cytoskeleton , cytoplasm and the nucleus , thereby engaging a range of diffusible and anchored substrates . the sub - strate specificities of pKDs and pKcs are different . thus , pKD activa - tion creates new branches in signalling networks and places distinct physio logical effectors and processes under Dag control . pKDs control fission and transport of golgi vesicles , mediate survival responses to oxidative stress , regulate antigen - activated signalling in t and B cells , inhibit JnK - dependent proliferation , modu late adhesion and elicit nuclear export of histone deacetylases ( rozengurt et al , 2005 ; Wang , 2006 ) . the functions of pKDs were discovered in model cell - culture systems ; a future challenge is to evaluate these findings in the context of normal cells and tissues of intact organisms . our knowledge of the substrates , regulation , function , inhibi - tors and organelle - specific effects of pKDs has recently increased dramatically . Here , we discuss studies that elucidate the roles of pKD - mediated signalling in normal and aberrant physiology , advance our understanding of pKD regulation and suggest that pKD inhibition or activation could be an effective therapy for human disease . Protein kinase D activation pKDs have two c1 domains ( a and b ) that bind to Dag and phorbol esters , an autoinhibitory pH module and a carboxy - terminal kinase segment ( Fig 1 ; rozengurt et al , 2005 ; Wang , 2006 ) . Signalling starts with ligand binding by seven - transmembrane or tyrosine - kinase receptors , which activate plc β or plc γ , respectively . plcs cleave pi4 , 5p 2 , thereby generating Dag and ip3 . Membrane - associated Dag binds to and activates pKc , and recruits pKD through its c1 domains ( Baron & Malhotra , 2002 ) . pKc then phosphorylates Ser 744 and Ser 748 in the pKD activation loop ( a - loop ; Fig 1 ; throughout this review , amino acids are numbered according to the sequence of murine pKD1 ) . non - phosphorylated pKDs have minimal catalytic activity ; a - loop phosphorylation induces a con - formational change that maximizes kinase activity . Dag - stimulated npKcs δ , ε , θ and η are dominant pKD activators ( rozengurt et al , 2005 ) ; however , ca 2 + and Dag - activated cpKcs α , β i and β ii can also activate pKDs ( li et al , 2004 ) . activated pKD1 and pKD2 autophosphorylate Ser 916 , which is embedded in a c - terminal S / tXl / V motif that binds to the pDz domains of substrate or scaffold proteins ( Matthews et al , 1999 ) . Ser 916 phosphorylation reverses the anchoring of pKDs to pDz - domain proteins by altering the charge and size of the pDz ligand site . phosphorylation of Ser 744 is essential for pKD catalytic activ - ity during brief or prolonged cell stimulation and subsequent trans - or autophosphorylation of Ser 748 and Ser 916 ( Jacamo et al , 2008 ; Sinnett - Smith et al , 2009 ) . pSer 916 is a priming site that is required for subsequent autophosphorylation of Ser 748 ( rybin et al , 2009 ) . after hormone - induced , pKc - mediated phosphorylation of Ser 744 , a pKD1 mutant lacking sustained Ser 748 phosphorylation remained active much longer than wild - type pKD1 ( rybin et al , 2009 ) . thus , pSer 916 and / or pSer 748 might limit the duration of pKD1 activation by enhancing dephosphorylation at pSer 744 .

Differ - ential regulation of pKD activity and signalling duration by distinct a - loop phospho - serines was initially described in Caenorhabditis elegans , and is conserved in humans ( Feng et al , 2006 , 2007 ) . the dynamics of pKD - catalysed phosphorylation were studied by targeting a FrEt reporter substrate , DKar ( table 1 ) , to discrete intra - cellular locations ( Kunkel et al , 2009 ) . nHErF1 , an F - actin - associated scaffold protein , recruits and concentrates pKD1 or pKD2—through a pDz domain—and pKc δ . Hormones elicit rapid pKD - mediated DKar phosphorylation in the nHErF1 complex . robust nHErF1 - associated protein - phosphatase activity and pKD autophosphoryla - tion at Ser 916 ( Fig 1 ) , which dissociates pKD from the complex , limit the extent and duration of DKar phosphorylation . phosphorylation of dispersed , lipid - anchored DKar in the plasma membrane is slow , but reaches higher amplitude because local protein - phosphatase activity is low . thus , local variations in D - kinase , substrate and protein - phosphatase concentrations create distinct pKD signalling ‘signatures’ in different microenvironments . Future work should aim to express authentic substrates tagged with improved FrEt reporters at physiological levels , allowing the determination of the distinctive dynamics of pKD - mediated signalling at the cytoplasmic surfaces of golgi , mitochondrial and plasma membranes , as well as in the actin cyto skeleton and nuclei of intact cells . Such studies would expand our understanding of localized , organelle - specific pKD regulation and functions in normal and disease - derived cells .

Src phosphorylates tyr 93 , creating a binding site for the pKc δ c2 domain . tethered pKc δ efficiently phosphor - ylates and activates pKD1 , which in turn activates a cytoplasmic iKK α – iKK β – nemo complex , eliciting i κ b degradation and nuclear translocation of nF - κ B ( Storz et al , 2005 ) . nF - κ B induces expres - sion of mito chondrial MnSoD , which removes toxic roS ( Fig 2a ) . When hormones or phorbol di butyrate activate pKDs at non - mitochondrial locations , tyr 93 is not phosphorylated and MnSoD and other protective proteins are not induced . thus , Src - mediated phosphorylation of pKD is essential to elicit signalling that leads to nF - κ B - mediated transcription of pro - survival genes . our knowledge of pKD - mediated survival signalling is in complete . the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying roS - induced plD1 activation and mitochondrial Dag accumula - tion is a central aim . in addition , as pKDs do not phosphorylate the iKK α – iKK β – nemo complex , the identification of pKD substrates that activate nF - κ B is another key goal . roS also induce rearrangements of the F - actin cytoskeleton that elicit activation of rhoa and its effector rho kinase ( rocK ) . rocK enhances Src and npKc activities , leading to activation of pKD1 – nF - κ B signalling ( cowell et al , 2009b ; Song J et al , 2006 ) . How rocK activates Src and npKc , and whether the rhoa – rocK com - plex is the predominant upstream regulator that couples stresses to pKD and nF - κ B activation remains to be elucidated ( Sidebar a ) . rocK also couples hormonal and immune stimuli to pKD1 activa - tion . rhoa – rocK activates pKD1 in a g - protein - coupled receptor ( gpcr ) - controlled pathway that promotes neurotensin secretion from enteroendocrine cells ( li et al , 2004 ) . plasma - membrane - targeted pKD1 is activated after pre - t - cell receptor stimulation . However , upstream rhoa activity is essential for expression of cD4 and cD8 co - receptors induced by membrane - bound pKD1 ( Mullin et al , 2006 ) .

Cell motility . a ‘motile cycle’ generates lamellipodia , which mediate polarized cell movement ( Fig 2B ; yamaguchi & condeelis , 2007 ) . cofilin severs actin filaments at the leading edge of motile cells , thereby generating barbed ends and a supply of actin monomers . a WaVE - 2 – cortactin – arp2 / 3 complex orchestrates actin polymeriza - tion at barbed filament - ends to create an expanded , branched net - work of F - actin . this process is coupled to actin de polymerization at the rear of the cell , thus generating cellular movement . phosphorylation of cofilin at Ser 3 by liM kinases reduces its F - actin - binding and severing activities , thereby suppressing cell motility ( Scott & olson , 2007 ) . Motility is restored when a protein phosphatase , SSH1l , dephosphorylates cofilin ( niwa et al , 2002 ) . pKD1 , SSH1l and F - actin form complexes in the lamellipodium ( Eiseler et al , 2009b ) . pKD1 phosphorylates SSH1l ( table 1 ) , dis - rupting its association with F - actin and creating a binding site for 14 - 3 - 3 adaptor proteins , a feature of several pKD substrates ( Eiseler et al , 2009b ; peterburs et al , 2009 ) . SSH1l – 14 - 3 - 3 complexes trans - locate to the cytoplasm , where they are segregated from phospho - cofilin ( Fig 2B ) . the pSer 3 – cofilin concentration increases , barbed - end formation is blocked and cell migration ceases . thus , phosphorylation of SSHl1 by pKD1 in response to stimuli regu - lates directed cell movement . pKD1 also reduces leading edge F - actin polymerization by phosphorylating cortactin ( table 1 ) , ena - bling 14 - 3 - 3 protein binding and stabilizing a complex containing WaVE - 2 , arp2 / 3 , F - actin and phospho - cortactin ( Fig 2B ; Eiseler et al , 2010 ) . Stabilization disrupts repetition of the motile cycle under lying lamellipodium formation . pKDs also inhibit F - actin remodelling and cell motility by phos - phorylating the ras effector rin1 ( table 1 ; ziegler et al , 2011 ) . pKD1 and rin1 colocalize at sites of F - actin remodelling near the cell periphery . prin1 activates the tyrosine kinase c - abl and the rin1 – c - abl complex phosphorylates and alters the conformation of crK , a scaffold protein that recruits F - actin remodelling proteins ( Hu et al , 2005 ; ziegler et al , 2011 ) . as a result , the affinity of crK for F - actin remodelling proteins is diminished , leading - edge pro - trusions cannot be formed and cells become non - motile . During the genesis and progression of carcinomas , changes in cell morphology and gene expression disrupt cell – cell adhesion and promote motility and invasiveness ( Kalluri & Weinberg , 2009 ) , a process known as epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( EMt ) . Diminished expression of E - cadherin ( E - cad ) , which maintains adherens junctions , is a key feature of EMt . Similarly to E - cad , pKD1 is down regulated in advanced prostate , breast and stomach can - cers . activated pKD1 phosphorylates the cytoplasmic tail of E - cad , thereby stabilizing its association with β - catenin and the F - actin cytoskeleton ( Jaggi et al , 2005 ) , strengthening adherens junctions and inhibiting motility . pKD1 is essential for maintaining E - Cad gene transcription and repressing mesenchymal protein expression ( Du et al , 2010 ) . thus , pKD1 depletion might facilitate EMt by compro - mising E - cad function and expression , and promoting mesenchymal gene expression . in prostate tumours and cell lines , the transcription factor Snail represses E - Cad gene expression . pKD1 phosphorylates Snail ( table 1 ) , enabling its binding with 14 - 3 - 3 , which mediates nuclear export and accumulation of pSnail in cytoplasm . consequently , Snail target genes are de - repressed and E - cad and other proteins that mediate adherens - junction formation and immobility are pro - duced . accordingly , pKD1 overexpression inhibited mesenchymal gene transcription and decreased tumour development by 70 % in a xenograft model ( Du et al , 2010 ) . analysis of human breast - cancer tissue arrays revealed that pKD1 protein decreased by approximately 60 % in invasive and meta - static ductal carcinomas ( Eiseler et al , 2009a ) , which might imply that pKD1 suppresses metastasis . restoration of pKD1 expression in invasive breast - cancer cells decreased migration and invasion in transwell and matrigel assays . Furthermore , activated pKD1 down - regulates mrnas encoding eight matrix metalloproteases ( MMps ) , which facilitate cell migration by degrading extracellular matrix ( Eiseler et al , 2009a ) . the mechanism through which this occurs is unknown . thus , targeted pKD1 gene therapy , re - expression of pKD1 by drugs that counter Dna or chromatin modification , or com - pounds that optimally activate pre - existing pKD1 , might diminish migration and metastasis of breast and prostate tumour cells . the attractive idea that pKD1 opposes EMt in developing cancers—by acting as a tumour or metastasis suppressor ( Du et al , 2010 ) —needs further evaluation because the available data are in conclusive . Microarray analysis of human prostate tumour sam - ples revealed correlations between decreased pKD1 and E - cad mrna levels and metastasis in one study , but no statistically sig - nificant associations were found in a second , larger collection of Fig 2 | Isoforms of protein kinase D regulate crucial aspects of cell physiology . ( A ) Cell survival after oxidative stress . Mitochondria - derived ROS leads to DAG generation and PKD1 recruitment and activation . PKD1 then promotes the activation and translocation of NF - κ B and co - activators from cytoplasm to nucleus . NF - κ B - dependent transcription induces MnSOD , which eliminates ROS . ( B ) Inhibition of cell migration . PKD phosphorylates SSH1L and cortactin in the F - actin cytoskeleton , leading to inhibition of actin - severing and polymerization activities that enable lamellipodium formation and , thus , inhibition of cell migration . ( C ) Golgi - vesicle fission and transport . PKD1 activation leads to PI4P production , which enables the delivery of endoplasmic - reticulum - derived cholesterol and ceramide to Golgi membranes by the docking of transfer proteins with PI4P . There , ceramide and phosphocholine are converted to sphingomyelin and DAG . Sphingomyelin and cholesterol are crucial for packaging and sorting of TGN vesicles and DAG increases the curvature of the TGN membrane , thereby facilitating fission and transport of vesicles to the plasma membrane ( inset ) . PKD1 prevents excessive , potentially toxic accumulation of cholesterol and ceramide through a negative - feedback loop . ( D ) Gene transcription . Activated PKDs phosphorylate HDAC5 and HDAC7 in the nucleus . Phosphorylated HDACs dissociate from the transcription activator MEF2 , leading to their cytoplasmic accumulation .

Future experiments demonstrating that Snail phosphor - ylation by pKD1 activates—de - represses—a specific transcription factor that drives E - Cad gene expression would provide support for a regulatory role of pKDs in EMt suppression . overall , pKDs can suppress cell motility by phosphorylating SSH1l , cortactin , E - cad , Snail and rin1 , or by controlling MMp expression . Determination of the relative importance of these effec - tors in various normal and transformed cell types and physio logical contexts is a central theme for further investigation ( Sidebar a ) . the quantification of the contributions of individual effectors to the inte - grated effects of pKD on cell motility will enhance our understand - ing of stable tissue organization , EMt and acquisition of metastatic potential by cancer cells . in principle , pKD signalling to the actin cytoskeleton can be diversified and amplified by interactions among D - kinase effectors . this proposition can be evaluated by system - atically studying the predicted coordinated induction of rin1 and E - cad expression through pKD - mediated phosphorylation of Snail ( Du et al , 2010 ; Milstein et al , 2007 ) ; the potential ability of SFKs to act simultaneously as both pKD regulators and effectors ( Doppler & Storz , 2007 ; ziegler et al , 2011 ) ; and the predicted , concerted inhib - itory effects of pSSHl1 and phospho - cortactin on sequential steps in the actin - polymerization phase of the motile cycle ( Eiseler et al , 2009b ; Eiseler et al , 2010 ) . Golgi vesicle fission and transport . pKDs associated with the cyto - plasmic surface of golgi membranes regulate the fission of vesicles that carry protein and lipid cargo from the trans - golgi network ( tgn ) to the plasma membrane ( Bard & Malhotra , 2006 ) . pKD2 and pKD3 are both required for proper vesicle fission and targeting in Hela cells ( Bossard et al , 2007 ) . the non - redundant pKDs might be spatially segregated in tgn sub - compartments , regulate distinct functions or operate as heterodimers . overexpressed pKD2 and pKD3 form dimers and each isoform catalyses cis and trans auto - phosphorylation reactions . However , only small amounts of total pKD2 and pKD3 proteins are engaged in complexes , and it is not known whether heterodimers accumulate on golgi membranes . pKDs phosphorylate and activate the golgi enzyme pi4Kiii β ( table 1 ; Fig 2c ; Hausser et al , 2005 ) . Subsequent binding of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins to pi4Kiii β inhibits its dephosphorylation , thereby stabiliz - ing enzymatic activity ( Hausser et al , 2006 ) . pi4Kiii β phosphorylates phosphatidyl inositol , generating pi4p , which is a docking site for pH domains of lipid and sterol transfer proteins ( graham & Burd , 2011 ) , such as cErt and oSBp ( Fig 2c ) . cErt delivers endoplasmic - reticulum - derived ceramide to golgi membranes , on which sphingo myelin synthase ( SMS ) converts ceramide and phosphatidyl - choline to sphingomyelin and Dag . phosphatidyl choline - derived Dag recruits and activates npKcs and pKDs at golgi membranes independently of gpcrs , rtKs , plcs or rhoa . oSBp transfers cholesterol and 25 - oH cholesterol from the endoplasmic reticulum to golgi , and forms complexes with cErt that allow accelerated transfer of sterols and ceramide to golgi membranes ( graham & Burd , 2011 ) . this promotes sphingo - myelin and Dag synthesis , feed - forward activation of pKD and pi4Kiii β , as well as formation of cholesterol – sphingomyelin com - plexes that mediate protein and lipid sorting and packaging , and vesicle budding in the tgn . Dag accumulation in the cytoplasmic leaflet of tgn membranes introduces negative curvature in the bilayer , which enables membrane invagination and vesicle fission ( Bard & Malhotra , 2006 ) . thus , these mechanisms link ceramide , sphingo myelin and cholesterol levels to pKD - stimulated export of tgn cargo to the plasma membrane . phosphorylation of oSBp by pKD disrupts sterol - dependent tar - geting of oSBp – cErt oligomers to golgi membranes ( nhek et al , 2010 ) , and pKD - mediated cErt phosphorylation further damp - ens ceramide delivery by reducing the affinity of cErt for pi4p ( Fugmann et al , 2007 ) . this negative feedback loop ( Fig 2c ) could fine - tune golgi sphingomyelin and Dag synthesis , and prevent build - up of toxic levels of cholesterol and sphingomyelin . a p21 gtp - binding protein , arF1 , could optimize pi4Kiii β acti - vation by pKD ( graham & Burd , 2011 ) . arF1 activates plD , thereby triggering Dag synthesis at golgi membranes . arF1 recruits pi4Kiii β to the tgn by direct binding . in addition , binding of both arF1 and Dag to pKD2 selectively target it to the tgn ( pusapati et al , 2010 ) . thus , arF1 might ensure efficient pi4p synthesis by coordinating Dag production with recruitment of pKc , pKD and pi4Kiii β to the tgn ( Fig 2c ) . g β 1 γ 2 subunits of heterotrimeric g - proteins associate with golgi membranes , on which they bind to and activate plc β 3 ( Diaz anel , 2007 ; irannejad & Wedegaertner , 2010 ) . the resulting Dag activates pKD , which promotes tgn vesicle fission and delivery of secreted proteins to the plasma membrane . the upstream regulators and mechanism for routing βγ subunits to tgn are unknown . However , the rate and level of tgn cargo export might be determined by pKD - dependent integration of Dag signals generated by plc β 3 , plD and sphingomyelin metabolism . active , golgi - associated pKDs are detected in hippocampal neurons ( czondor et al , 2009 ) . the pKDs direct sorting and packag - ing of integral membrane proteins in tgn - derived vesicles , which fuse selectively with the plasma membrane that envelops dendrites ( Bisbal et al , 2008 ; czondor et al , 2009 ) . this generates and main - tains neuronal polarity and specialized post - synaptic functions . increases or decreases in pKD activity cause parallel changes in dendritic branching . pKD depletion increases the endocytosis of dendritic - membrane proteins , but has no effect on vesicle fission ( Bisbal et al , 2008 ) . thus , neuronal , golgi - bound pKDs sustain cell polarity and dendritic specialization by ensuring differential protein sorting , packaging and targeting in the tgn and suppressing endo - cytosis of dendritic membrane proteins . the pKD effectors that are relevant to these processes are unknown . pKD1 phosphorylates Ki220 ( table 1 ) , a transmembrane scaf - fold protein that accumulates at the dendritic plasma membrane ( Sanchez - ruiloba et al , 2006 ) and modulates phosphorylation of Map1 and stathmin by other protein kinases . Ki220 regulates neuronal development , morphogenesis and polarity ( Higuero et al , 2010 ) . autophosphorylation of pKD1 Ser 916 is a crucial step in routing Ki220 from the tgn to the plasma membrane , but the underlying mechanism for this is not completely understood ( Sanchez - ruiloba et al , 2006 ) . the M3 acetylcholine ( ach ) receptor , a gpcr that promotes insulin release from pancreatic β - cells , is coupled to plc β by gq ( gautam et al , 2006 ) . pKD1 is a key downstream effector that links binding of ach by the receptor to enhanced , glucose - dependent insulin secretion ( Kong et al , 2010 ) . agonist - occupied M3 recep - tors are phosphorylated by gpcr kinases ( grKs ) , generating dock - ing sites for the scaffold protein β - arrestin ( luttrell & gesty - palmer , 2010 ) . β - arrestin assembles multi - protein signalling complexes that are delivered to intracellular locations by endosomes . pKD1 activation and ach - augmented insulin secretion are suppressed in ©2011 EuropEan MolEcular Biology organization EMBo reports Vol 12 | no 8 | 2011 791 reviews rev iew animals expressing mutated , phosphorylation - deficient M3 recep - tors that activate plc β , but fail to bind to β - arrestin ( Kong et al , 2010 ) . Depletion of β - arrestin or pKD1 with small - interfering rna reduces ach - induced insulin secretion in β - cells . thus , pKD1 medi - ates neural regulation of insulin release and contributes to homeo - static regulation of glucose metabolism . plc and pKc inhibitors do not disrupt β - arrestin - mediated pKD1 activation . the elucidation of the mechanism by which β - arrestin controls pKD1 activation is an important objective . pKD1 enhances glucose - dependent insulin secretion by increas - ing golgi fission in β - cells ( Sumara et al , 2009 ) . this action of pKD1 is negatively modulated by p38 δ Map kinase , which binds to and phosphorylates pKD1 , thereby inhibiting its catalytic activ - ity . Disruption of the p38 δ gene in mice persistently activates pKD1 , which enhances insulin secretion and glucose tolerance and protects animals against hyperlipidaemia , oxidative stress and apoptosis . Transcription . class - iia histone deacetylases ( HDac4 , HDac5 , HDac7 and HDac9 ) , are recruited to gene promoters by transcrip - tion factors , such as MEF2 , runX and caMta2 , and co ordinately repress genes that co - regulate cell - type - specific functions . HDacs inhibit MEF2 - mediated transcription by chromatin remodel - ling , recruitment of co - repressors , MEF2 deacetylation , allosteric inhibition and facilitation of SuMoylation ( Martin et al , 2007 ) . When neonatal rat ventricular myocytes are persistently stimu - lated by α - adrenergic agonist or endothelin 1 ( Et1 ) , pKD1 phospho - rylates HDac5 ( table 1 ) . pHDac5 dissociates from MEF2 and binds to 14 - 3 - 3 adaptor proteins , which promote export of HDacs from nucleus to cytoplasm ( Fig 2D ; Vega et al , 2004 ) . MEF2 then recruits co - activators and drives transcription of fetal genes encoding pro - teins involved in contraction , ca 2 + handling and energy metabo - lism . these proteins degrade the performance of the adult heart , leading to compensatory hypertrophy , and eventually heart failure ( Fielitz et al , 2008 ) . phosphorylation by pKD1 also elicits the dis - sociation of HDac5 from caMta2 , a co - activator that co operates with the nkx2 - 5 transcription factor ( Song K et al , 2006 ) . an acti - vated caMta2 – nkx2 - 5 complex drives cardiac gene transcription , promoting hypertrophy along with MEF2 . these observations and studies in mice lacking or overexpressing heart pKD1 ( Fielitz et al , 2008 ) indicate that pKD1 is a central mediator of persistent , stress - induced cardiac hypertrophy . However , the normal functions of pKD1 - mediated de - repression of MEF2 in adult heart remain to be characterized ( Sidebar a ) . pKD1 also mediates dynamic , non - transcriptional regulation of myocardial excitation – contraction coupling . phosphorylation of tro - ponin i reduces the ca 2 + sensitivity of myofibres , thereby diminishing twitch amplitude by approximately 80 % ( cuello et al , 2007 ) . in skeletal muscle , pKD1 elicits expression of slow - twitch contractile proteins that mediate muscle endurance , through HDac5 phosphorylation and MEF2 activation ( Kim et al , 2008 ) . Depletion of pKD1 in skeletal muscle diminishes endurance , but un expectedly does not alter contractile protein expression . thus , further work is needed to establish a molecular explanation for the anti - fatigue effects of pKD1 . VEgF - a elicits pKD activation in endothelial cells by stimulat - ing plc γ ( Wong & Jin , 2005 ) . pKD phosphorylates HDac7 ( table 1 ; Fig 2D ) , leading to 14 - 3 - 3 binding and nuclear export . as a con - sequence , MEF2 - dependent and - independent angiogenic gene expression is switched on ( Ha et al , 2008 ; Wang et al , 2008 ) . HDac7 - regulated gene repression and de - repression are in dispensable for endothelial - cell migration , tube formation and genesis of capillaries ; other HDacs are nonessential . By contrast , angiotensin - ii - induced , pKD - mediated HDac5 phosphorylation and nuclear export facili - tate MEF2 - activated gene transcription and vascular smooth - muscle cell hypertrophy ( Xu et al , 2007 ) . Bone morphogenetic proteins promote bone formation and maintain the skeleton by activating signalling pathways that con - verge on runX , a regulator of osteoblast gene transcription . runX is repressed by HDac7 binding , and bone morphogenetic pro - teins induce pKD1 - catalysed phosphorylation of HDac7 , thereby switching on gene expression ( Jensen et al , 2009 ) . However , pKD1 is also required for runX - mediated transcription when HDac7 is in active , implying that pKD1 acts both upstream and downstream from HDac7 , although its downstream effectors are unknown . MEF2 , runX , caMta2 and other HDac - iia - associated tran - scription factors are poised to stimulate gene expression in vari - ous cells and tissues—including cardiac and skeletal muscle , endothelial cells , bone and t cells—in which pKD has a central transcriptional role in immune tolerance ( Dequiedt et al , 2005 ) . consequently , signalling modules consisting of plc , Dag , pKc , pKDs and HDacs control and integrate many aspects of physiol - ogy in vivo , by acting at the transcriptional level . pKD - catalysed phosphorylation of class - iia HDacs provides a molecular link that couples extracellular stimuli and internal Dag to a portion of the inducible transcriptome ( Fig 2D ) . Innate immunity . C . elegans physiology and behaviour are regulated by signalling molecules , mechanisms and pathways that are usu - ally conserved in mammals . the C . elegans dkf - 2 gene encodes two prototypical pKDs : DKF - 2a , formerly DKF - 2 , and DKF - 2B . animals homozygous for a dkf - 2 - null allele develop and reproduce normally ( Feng et al , 2007 ) and can be reconstituted with wild - type or mutant transgenes and challenged with different stimuli to analyse DKF - 2 regulation and function in vivo . C . elegans intestinal epithelial cells constitute an innate immune system that suppresses toxicity and proliferation of ingested patho - gens . animals lacking DKF - 2a are hypersensitive to killing by human and C . elegans bacterial pathogens ( ren et al , 2009 ) .

DKF - 2a activates pMK - 1 ( p38 α Map kinase ) , which is essential for induction of approximately 80 % of the immune effec - tors . thus , DKF - 2a places p38 α Map kinase and its effectors under the partial control of stimuli that generate Dag . Associative learning . C . elegans displays chemotactic behaviour toward na + , but pre - incubation with sodium salts in the absence of food elicits na + avoidance . Both na + - induced chemotaxis and na + or starvation - dependent learning—na + avoidance—can be accurately quantified . DKF - 2B is expressed in neurons that govern na + chemotaxis and learning ( Fu et al , 2009 ) ; disruption of the dkf - 2 gene has no effect on na + detection or chemotaxis , but na + - dependent learn - ing is strongly suppressed . Surprisingly , both neuronal DKF - 2B and intestinal DKF - 2a are essential to restore learning in dkf - 2 null animals . Egl - 8—a plc β homologue—and tpa - 1 control both DKF - 2B and DKF - 2a in vivo ( Fu et al , 2009 ) . thus , the integration of signals produced by Dag – pKD controlled pathways in both neu - rons and intestinal cells is required to generate a learned behaviour : na + avoidance . these observations demonstrate that cooperating pKDs regulate a crucial nervous - system function . na + - detecting neurons and their synaptic partners express DKF - 2B , suggesting that this pKD might modulate synaptic transmission underlying associative learning . Whether DKF - 2a contributes to behavioural plasticity by trans ducing a starvation signal in the intestine remains to be determined . DKF - 2a activation might trigger secretion of a diffusible gut hormone that binds to neuronal receptors , thereby coupling an intestinal signal to regulation of neuronal physiology . Differential regulation and new functions of PKD isoforms the regulation and function of pKD isoforms can be markedly dif - ferent ( Fig 3 ) . Disruption of the mouse Pkd1 gene or ‘knock - in’ of catalytically inactive Pkd1 causes embryonic lethality ( Fielitz et al , 2008 ; Matthews et al , 2010 ) ; pKD2 and pKD3 cannot compensate for pKD1 depletion . Similarly , pKD1 dominates in mediating stress - induced cardiac hypertrophy and insulin release from β - cells ( Fielitz et al , 2008 ; Sumara et al , 2009 ) . pKD1 and pKD2 phosphorylate and activate pi4Kiii β , but pKD3 does not ( Hausser et al , 2005 ) . animals lacking pKD2 , which is abundantly expressed in t and B lympho - cytes , develop and reproduce normally . pKD2 deficiency does not alter t - and B - cell development , but t - cell - receptor - stimulated cytokine production and t - cell - dependent immunoglobulin g and immunoglobulin M production are inhibited ( Matthews et al , 2010 ) , thereby revealing unique functions of pKD2 . pKD2 shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus of gastric can - cer cells . a gpcr – plc β signalling module promotes simul taneous activation of pKD2 and casein kinase 1 ( von Blume et al , 2007 ) . casein kinase 1 inhibits pKD2 nuclear export by phosphorylating PKD Cortical F - actin cytoskeleton Cytoplasm Nucleus Golgi membranes Secretoryvesicles Plasmamembrane 14 - 3 - 3 14 - 3 - 3 pHDAC7 P P 14 - 3 - 3 14 - 3 - 3 pHDAC5 P P 14 - 3 - 3 P pSNAIL HDAC7 HDAC5 SNAIL P OSBP OSBP P CERT CERT 14 - 3 - 3 PI4KIII β P pCortactin P 14 - 3 - 3 SSH1L pRIN1 SSH1L P Mitochondrion Endoplasmic reticulum NF - κ B P Fig 3 | Intracellular distribution of protein kinase D effectors .

Pkd3 gene disruption causes only a minor skeletal defect in mice , indicating that it has a minimal role in development ( Matthews et al , 2010 ) . unlike pKD1 and pKD2 , pKD3 is not targeted to pDz - domain scaffold proteins because it lacks a pDz - ligand motif . However , plc activation elicits efficient , selective accumulation of activated pKD3 in epithelial - cell nuclei . this is associated with upregulation of pro - survival signalling pathways and progression of invasive prostate cancer ( chen et al , 2008 ) . Hence , pKD3 might be a marker and a drug target in prostate cancer . in neonatal - rat ventricular myocytes , norepinephrine , Et1 and thrombin activate plc β , whereas pDgF elicits plc γ activation ( Fig 2D ) . norepinephrine selectively activates pKD1 ; thrombin and pDgF increase pKD2 activity ; and Et1 stimulates both pKD iso - forms ( guo et al , 2011 ) . this suggests that pKD isoforms co localize with one or a subset of receptor – plc signalling modules at discrete plasma membrane micro - domains . receptor - specific scaffold proteins might selectively bind to pKD1 or pKD2 . if differentially regulated pKDs phosphorylate a shared substrate , then the con - centration and net activity of phospho - effectors would reflect integrated input signals from several pathways . norepinephrine , thrombin , Et1 and pDgF elicit pKD - mediated phosphorylation of the transcription factor crEB ( table 1 ; guo et al , 2011 ) , supporting the latter possibility . However , pathway - specific effectors cannot be excluded . PKD inhibitors the observations that pKDs promote cardiac hypertrophy , angio - genesis and migration of some cancer cells prompted development of pKD inhibitors as therapeutic agents . go6976 , an indolo - carbazole , effectively inhibits pKDs ( table 2 ) . in combination with other tools , go6976 facilitated characterization of pKD functions in cell lines . However , go6976 also inhibits other protein kinases at the concentrations required for pKD inhibition ( Bain et al , 2007 ) , making it difficult to interpret results . nB - 142 - 70 , a benzoxoloazepinolone , is a less - promiscuous pKD inhibitor that partly suppresses prostate - cancer - cell migra - tion , invasion and proliferation in culture ( lavalle et al , 2010 ) . nevertheless , some effects of nB - 142 - 70 might reflect inhibition of a few off - target kinases ( table 2 ) . anticipated improvements in specificity and cytotoxicity , along with testing in animals , might yield benzoxoloazepinolone pKD inhibitors suitable for clinical trials on prostate cancer ( lavalle et al , 2010 ) . Stress - induced cardiac hypertrophy is associated with persist - ent HDac5 phosphorylation by pKD1 ( Fig 2D ) , and concomitant activation of fetal contractile gene expression by de - repressed MEF2 . as caMKii , MarK , SiK1 and grK5 phosphorylate HDac5 , the relative importance of pKD1 has been unclear . in ventricular myocytes , a potent , specific , bipyridyl inhibitor BpKDi ( Monovich et al , 2010 ; table 2 ) blocked pKD1 activation by gpcrs , leading to strong suppression of HDac5 phosphorylation and hypertrophic gene expression . thus , BpKDi , which has no effect on pKcs or other HDac5 kinases , revealed a dominant role for pKD1 in heart hyper - trophy . in rat models of cardiac hypertrophy , BpKDi blocked pKD1 activation and HDac5 phosphorylation in lymphocytes ( Meredith et al , 2010 ) . unexpectedly , BpKDi did not diminish hypertrophy , which might be due to insufficient drug availability or compensa - tory cardiac gene expression . Systematic pharmacological manipu - lations and the development of sensitive assays for pKD1 activation in heart muscle will be needed to assess further the efficacy of amidobipyridyl inhibitors . crt5 , a pyrazine benzamide ( table 2 ) , inhibits pKDs down - stream from the VEgF receptor in endothelial cells , suppressing endothelial - cell migration , proliferation and tubulogenesis ( Evans et al , 2010 ) . Many pancreatic cancers and derived cell lines have high levels of activated pKD1 ; crt0066101 ( table 2 ) potently inhibits pKD1 and HSp27 phosphorylation and suppresses stress and survival signalling mediated by nF - κ B , another pKD1 tar - get ( Harikumar et al , 2010 ) . oral administration of crt0066101 reduces tumour growth in subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic cancer xenografts in mice ( Harikumar et al , 2010 ) . angiogenesis is also inhibited in crt0066101 - treated tumour explants ( ochi et al , 2011 ) . these results suggest that pKDs could be targets for therapy in a high - mortality cancer that has limited treatment options . Concluding remarks compelling studies on cultured cells demonstrate that pKDs are key signalling proteins that link substrate - effectors and physio - logical processes to regulation by the many stimuli that elicit Dag bio genesis ( Figs 2D , 3 ) . pKDs are expressed in many mammalian tissues , but knowledge of their in vivo functions is limited to glu - cose - and ach - regulated insulin release , a subset of tcr - regulated Table 2 | Protein kinase D inhibitors Inhibitor Chemical class IC 50 value ( nM ) Other targets Application References Go6976 Indolocarbazole 20 cPKCs , PDK - 1 , RSK2 , GSK3 β , CDK2 , p70S6K , CHK2 Elucidate PKD regulation and function Gschwendt et al , 1996 ; Bain et al , 2007 NB - 142 - 70 Benzoxaloazepinolone 30 – 60 GSK3 β , CDK2 , ERK Prostate cancer therapy Sharlow et al , 2008 ; Lavalle et al , 2010 BPKDi Amidobipyridyl 1 – 10 IKK β Elucidate PKD regulation and function , therapy for cardiac hypertrophy Monovich et al , 2010 ; Meredith et al , 2010 CRT5 Pyrazine benzamide 1 . 5 Angiogenesis inhibitor Evans et al , 2010 CRT0066101 Pyrazine benzamide 2 Pancreatic cancer therapy ; angiogenesis inhibitor Harikumar et al , 2010 ; Ochi et al , 2011 Data on cross - inhibition of other protein kinases by CRT compounds were not available when this Review was completed .

Studies of the functions and activity - sustaining mechanisms of persistent ly activated pKDs in various contexts might reveal a variety of previous ly unappreciated contributions of D kinases to cell and tis - sue physiology . other directions for studies on pKD regulation and function are included in Sidebar a . the discovery of pKDs by the rozengurt and pfizenmaier labo - ratories in 1994 initially stimulated interest in Dag - mediated sig - nal transduction , and subsequently changed concepts regarding the dissemination and consequences of regulatory signals transmitted by plcs and pKcs . powerful tools are now available that will allow broader and deeper exploration of the regulation , functions and small - molecule inhibition of pKDs . a comprehensive understand - ing of contributions of pKDs to the regulation of many fundamental aspects of mammalian and , more generally , metazoan physiology and pathology is the anticipated outcome . acKnoWlEDgEMEntS research on pKDs in the rubin laboratory is supported by grant gM080615 from the national institutes of Health , uSa . conFlict oF intErESt the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest . rEFErEncES Bain J , plater l , Elliott M , Shpiro n , Hastie cJ , Mclauchlan H , Klevernic i , arthur JS , alessi Dr , cohen p ( 2007 ) the selectivity of protein kinase inhibitors : a further update .
