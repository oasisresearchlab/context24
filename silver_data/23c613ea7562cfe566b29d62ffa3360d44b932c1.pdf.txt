Abstract The yeast protein Ccz1p is necessary for vacuolar protein trafﬁcking and biogenesis . In a complex with Mon1p , it mediates fusion of transport intermediates with the vacuole membrane by activating the small GTPase Ypt7p . Additionally , genetic data suggest a role of Ccz1p in earlier transport steps , in the Golgi . In a search for further proteins interacting with Ccz1p , we identiﬁed the endosomal soluble N - ethylmalei - mide - sensitive factor attachment protein receptor Pep12p as an interaction partner of Ccz1p . Combining the ccz1 D mutation with deletions of PEP12 or other genes encoding components of the endosomal fusion machinery , VPS21 , VPS9 or VPS45 , results in synthetic growth phenotypes . The genes MON1 and YPT7 also interact genetically with PEP12 . These results suggest that the Ccz1p – Mon1p – Ypt7p complex is involved in fusion of transport vesicles to multiple target membranes in yeast cells . Introduction Intracellular vesicular transport plays a crucial role in the compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells . Selective fusion of transport vesicles with their target organelles is necessary for maintaining compartment identity . Intensive studies on membrane fusion have led to the identiﬁcation of many proteins involved in this process . The key players include the soluble NSF attachment protein receptor ( SNARE ) proteins ( for a recent review , see Ungermann & Langosch , 2005 ; Cai et al . , 2007 ; Gurkan et al . , 2007 ) , small GTPases of the Rab / Ypt family ( Pfeffer , 2001 ) , members of the Sec1 / MUNC18 ( SM ) family of proteins ( Toonen & Verhage , 2003 ) and the largely unrelated group of multi - subunit - tethering complexes ( Whyte & Munro , 2002 ) . The question of which of these components are responsible for ensuring fusion selectivity has been the subject of intense debate over the past years . Reports showing that SNARE interactions are not fully speciﬁc , but can be promiscuous ( reviewed in G¨otte & von Mollard , 1998 ) , and also that other components of the fusion machin - ery may be involved in fusion at multiple sites in the cell ( Srivastava et al . , 2000 ; Peterson & Emr , 2001 ; Subramanian et al . , 2004 ) , are making it increasingly clear that no single factor is sufﬁcient to confer speciﬁcity to the fusion reaction . Presumably , speciﬁc combinations of all the components mentioned are necessary for correct vesicle targeting . The yeast protein Ccz1p has previously been shown to function in the fusion of diverse types of compartments , because it has been implicated in the biosynthetic trafﬁcking routes for both carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) and alkaline phosphatase , in the cytoplasm - to - vacuole targeting path - way , autophagy , pexophagy and homotypic vacuole fusion ( Kucharczyk et al . , 2000 ; Meiling - Wesse et al . , 2002 ; Wang et al . , 2002 , 2003 ) . It forms a stable complex with Mon1p ( Wang et al . , 2002 , 2003 ) and interacts physically with the Rab - GTPase Ypt7p ( Kucharczyk et al . , 2001 ) , which regu - lates the docking of many transport intermediates at the vacuolar membrane ( G¨otte et al . , 2000 ) . On the other hand , a ccz1 D deletion – but not mon1 D or ypt7 D – is synthetically lethal with an arl1 D mutation , and the cells can be rescued by overexpression of Ypt1p , a Rab - GTPase localized to early Golgi compartments ( Love et al . , 2004 ; Hoffman - Sommer et al . , 2005 ) . These interactions suggest an involvement of Ccz1p in transport through the Golgi apparatus , and this FEMS Yeast Res 9 ( 2009 ) 565 – 573 c (cid:2) 2009 Institute of Biochemistry & Biophysics PAS Journal compilation c (cid:2) 2009 Federation of EuropeanMicrobiological Societies Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd . function would be independent of Mon1p and Ypt7p . The interaction of CCZ1 with ARL1 suggests that Ccz1p might play a role in additional trafﬁcking steps , other than vacuolar fusion . In this study , we show that the endosomal syntaxin Pep12p , functioning as a common heavy chain in many SNARE complexes at the endosome membrane ( von Mollard et al . , 1997 ; Lewis & Pelham , 2002 ; Paumet et al . , 2004 ) , physically and genetically interacts with the Ccz1p – Mon1p complex . In addition , genetic interactions of CCZ1 with genes encoding other components of the endosomal fusion ma - chinery are demonstrated . These data suggest that the Ccz1p – Mon1p complex functions at multiple sites in the cell . Materials and methods Strains , growth conditions and genetic analysis The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are described in Table 1 . Unless indicated otherwise , all strains constructed in this work are isogenic with BY4741 . Standard complete YEPD ( yeast extract , peptone , dextrose ) , minimal SD and SC - drop - out media were used for yeast cultivation ( Amberg et al . , 2005 ) . For testing the sensitivity to Ca 2 1 ions , solid YEPD medium was supplemented with CaCl 2 at the indicated concentration ( Rieger et al . , 1997 ) . Standard genetic methods for mating , sporulation and tetrad analysis were used ( Amberg et al . , 2005 ) . For determining the growth phenotypes of double mutants obtained in this study , three separate spores carrying conﬁrmed double deletions were assayed for each strain .

Kucharczyk et al . were used . The plasmids encoding fusions of the LexA DNA - binding domain or Gal4 DNA - binding or activation do - mains ( Table 2 ) were cotransformed into the L40 or the PJ69 - 4A strain . Growth was monitored on plates without leucine , tryptophan and histidine , supplemented with 1 mM 3 - aminotriazole for tests in the L40 strain . Fluorescence microscopy Uptake and vacuolar transport of the lipophilic styryl dye FM4 - 64 ( Molecular Probes ) was performed as described by Vida & Emr ( 1995 ) . For vacuole labeling , cells were grown to an OD 600nm of 0 . 8 – 1 . 2 , harvested and resuspended at an OD 600nm of 10 – 20 UmL in fresh YEPD . FM4 - 64 was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 40 m M . After 15 min of labeling at room temperature , the cells were harvested , resuspended in fresh YEPD at an OD 600nm of 5 – 10 mL – 1 and incubated at 28 1 C with vigorous shaking for 2 h . Cells were centrifuged , resuspended in fresh YEPD at an OD 600nm of 10 – 20 mL – 1 , placed on slides and viewed with the rhodamine ﬁlter under a Nikon Eclipse E800 ﬂuorescence microscope . For FM4 - 64 endocytosis , the cells were grown to the early logarithmic phase at 28 1 C , harvested and FM4 - 64 was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 40 m M for a 30 - min internalization step on ice . Excess FM4 - 64 was washed away ; the cells were transferred to fresh medium and incubated at 28 1 C with vigorous shaking . After 20 , 60 and 120 min , samples were drawn from the cultures ; the cells were washed , placed on slides and viewed . Live cells expressing Ste2 - green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) were cultured at 28 1 C to a density of 0 . 5 – 0 . 6 OD 600nm , harvested and resuspended in phosphate - buffered saline , pH 7 . 5 , 10mM NaN 3 for visualization . Half of the cell suspension was incubated at 37 1 C for 30min and then photographed . Results and discussion CCZ1interacts genetically with the PEP12and SYN8genes We used the yeast two - hybrid system to search for novel interaction partners of the S . cerevisiae Ccz1p protein . Among the proteins identiﬁed in this screen were the products of the genes PEP12 and SYN8 . The Pep12p protein is a t - SNARE of the syntaxin family . It localizes mainly to the membrane of late endosomes and is required for all known trafﬁcking pathways that lead into this compartment in yeast cells ( Gerrard et al . , 2000 ) . It functions as a common heavy chain in all SNARE complexes that have been de - scribed in the endosomal membrane ( von Mollard et al . , 1997 ; Lewis & Pelham , 2002 ; Paumet et al . , 2004 ) . The Syn8p protein is a component of two SNARE complexes : with Pep12p , Vti1p and Ykt6p , it forms a complex functioning in the Golgi - to - endosome transport pathway , whereas with Pep12p , Vti1p and Snc1 / 2p it functions in the fusion of plasma membrane - derived endocytic vesicles with the late endosome ( Lewis & Pelham , 2002 ) . Tlg1p can substitute for Syn8p in these SNARE complexes – when Tlg1p is present , Syn8p can be removed without loss of Pep12p function or induction of any other trafﬁcking defect . To conﬁrm the cooperation between Ccz1p , Pep12p and Syn8p , the existence of a genetic interaction between the genes encoding these proteins was tested . Tetrad analysis of the heterozygous diploids ccz1 D PEP12 / CCZ1 pep12 D and ccz1 D SYN8 / CCZ1 syn8 D revealed that in both cases all four haploid segregants were viable on standard YEPD media at 28 1 C . At 37 1 C , the single - mutant pep12 D grew slower than the wild - type and ccz1 D strains , whereas growth of the ccz1 D pep12 D cells was completely blocked . Spore clones bearing the ccz1 D syn8 D mutations grew equally well as the parental strains ( Fig . 1a ) . Further phenotypic analysis was carried out on YEPD medium supplemented with 0 . 3 M CaCl 2 . Under these conditions , growth of the single ccz1 D strain was slowed down ( Kucharczyk et al . , 2000 ) . As shown in Fig . 1a , the single mutants pep12 D and ccz1 D grew slower than the wild type on YEPD 1 CaCl 2 plates , whereas the double - mutant ccz1 D pep12 D did not grow at all . Interestingly , introduction of the syn8 D mutation into the ccz1 D strain rescued its calcium sensitivity . This result was corroborated by the discovery that overproduction of Syn8p causes enhance - ment of the sensitivity phenotype ( not shown ) . It is too early to speculate on the mechanism underlying this phenomen - on , but it is interesting in terms of the relation between calcium sensitivity and vacuole morphology . We have pre - viously considered the calcium sensitivity of the ccz1 D strain to be a consequence of its abnormal vacuole morphology Table 2 .

Here we show that in the ccz1 D syn8 D mutant these two phenotypes are uncoupled : vacuole morphology remains similar as in the ccz1 D single mutant ( Fig . 1b ) while calcium sensitivity becomes less severe . This demonstrates that disturbed vacuole morphology and func - tion are only one of the factors contributing to calcium sensitivity in the ccz1 D strain . Next , comparison of the vacuolar morphology in the single and double mutants was carried out . For this purpose , the cells were stained with the vacuolar membrane dye FM4 - 64 ( Vida & Emr , 1995 ) . As shown in Fig . 1b , the vacuoles of ccz1 D cells were fragmented ( class B vps mutant , Raymond et al . , 1992 ) whereas pep12 D cells had single , large vacuoles ( class D vps mutant ) . The syn8 D strain represented a wild - type vacuole morphology . The ccz1 D pep12 D mutant displayed a novel , mixed phenotype , with most cells containing an intermediary number of round vacuoles , while other cells appeared to resemble either of the parental strains . The fragmented vacuolar morphology of the ccz1 D mutant was epistatic to that of the syn8 D mutant in the ccz1 D syn8 D mutants ( Fig . 1b ) . Genetic interactions of MON1and YPT7 with PEP12 Because Ccz1p is known to regulate the Ypt7p GTPase in a complex with Mon1p ( Wang et al . , 2003 ; Hoffman - Sommer et al . , 2005 ) , we checked whether MON1 and YPT7 would also display synthetic genetic interactions with PEP12 . Tetrad analy - sis of the heterozygous diploids mon1 D PEP12 / MON1 pep12 D and ypt7 D PEP12 / YPT7 pep12 D was carried out . As shown in Fig . 2a , the double mutants mon1 D pep12 D and ypt7 D pep12 D displayed the same growth defects as ccz1 D pep12 D : they were temperature - sensitive and showed additive growth defects on calcium plates . In addition , both Mon1p and Ypt7p interacted with Pep12p in the two - hybrid system ( Fig . 2b ) . The vacuole morphology of mon1 D pep12 D was similar to that of ccz1 D pep12 D cells . The pep12 D ypt7 D double mutant , however , despite displaying the same growth defects as the ccz1 D pep12 D and mon1 D pep12 D strains ( Fig . 2a ) , differed from them in terms of vacuolar morphology . The pep12 D ypt7 D strain contained almost no discernible va - cuoles at all , displaying a vacuolar phenotype even more severe than that of the single ypt7 D mutant ( Fig . 2c ) . These results indicated that the function of Ccz1p responsible for the synthetic interaction with Pep12p was common to the whole Ccz1p – Mon1p – Ypt7p complex . Temperature sensitivity has been reported previously for strains in which fusion both at the endosomal and at the vacuolar membrane is very strongly impaired , such as pep12 D vam3 D or vps21 D ypt7 D ( Peterson & Emr , 2001 ) . These strains also exhibit a very severe vacuole morphology phenotype , similar to that of the pep12 D ypt7 D mutant , resulting probably from the nearly complete block in vacuolar protein trafﬁcking . A similar mechanism could thus account for the temperature sensitivity of the pep12 D ypt7 D strain . In the ccz1 D pep12 D and mon1 D pep12 D strains , on the other hand , transport of proteins to the vacuole is not completely blocked , because discernible vacuoles are clearly present , and so probably the tempera - ture sensitivity of these strains cannot be attributed solely to their vacuolar - trafﬁcking defects . The synthetic interaction of CCZ1with PEP12is not specific , but also occurs for other components of the vacuolar and endosomal fusion machineries We assumed that the temperature - and calcium - sensitivity phenotypes of the ccz1 D pep12 D , mon1 D pep12 D and Fig . 1 .

Kucharczyk et al . pep12 D ypt7 D strains are the effect of simultaneous disrup - tion of the vacuolar and endosomal fusion machineries . If this were true , then combining the ccz1 D mutation with deletions of other genes of the Pep12p - containing endoso - mal fusion complex should cause similar phenotypes . Therefore , we analyzed the growth of cells that lack Ccz1p in combination with deletions of the genes VPS21 , VPS9 and VPS45 . These genes code for components of the late - endosomal fusion machinery : Vps21p is the Rab - GTPase responsible for this fusion step ( Gerrard et al . , 2000 ) , Vps9p is the guanine - nucleotide exchange factor for Vps21p and is necessary for regulation of this protein ( Hama et al . , 1999 ) and Vps45p represents the main Sec1 / MUNC18 - like ( SM ) protein responsible for the entry of trafﬁc from the biosyn - thetic route into the late endosome ( Bryant et al . , 1998 ; Bryant & James , 2001 ) . Tetrad analysis of the heterozygous diploids ccz1 D VPS9 / CCZ1 vps9 D , ccz1 D VPS21 / CCZ1 vps21 D and ccz1 D VPS45 / CCZ1 vps45 D revealed that in all cases all four haploid segregants were viable on standard YEPD media at 28 1 C , whereas at 37 1 C the growth of spore clones bearing the double mutations ccz1 D vps9 D , ccz1 D vps45 D and ccz1 D vps21 D was blocked ( Fig . 3 ) . Further phenotypic analysis was carried out on YEPD medium supplemented with 0 . 3 M CaCl 2 . Growth of the single - mutant strains was not affected by calcium , but growth of the double mutants ccz1 D vps9 D , ccz1 D vps45 D and ccz1 D vps21 D was strongly inhibited , as for ccz1 D pep12 D . The synthetic genetic interaction of CCZ1 with PEP12 is therefore not speciﬁc for this particular gene , but rather for all components of the late - endosomal fusion machinery . We do not observe such synthetic growth defects when cells are depleted of Ccz1p together with other proteins of the vacuolar fusion complex . The double deletion of CCZ1 with VAM3 , which codes for the syntaxin component of the vacuolar fusion machinery , did not lead to synthetic growth defects ( Fig . 3 ) , and neither did a double deletion of CCZ1 with YPT7 ( Kucharczyk et al . , 2000 ) . At the same time , double deletions of PEP12 with the genes coding for other components of the endosomal fusion complex did not cause any additive defects ( Fig . 3 ) , while growth of a pep12 D vam3 D mutant was strongly inhibited ( Peterson & Emr , 2001 ) . The observed strong synthetic phenotypes indicate that Ccz1p , besides its role in vacuolar fusion , also inﬂu - ences the same stage of the vacuolar protein sorting ( VPS ) pathway as the Pep12p , Vps21p and Vps45p proteins . The genetic data of the interactions of CCZ1 and PEP12 indicate the existence of two functionally distinct complexes Fig . 2 . MON1 and YPT7 interact genetically with PEP12 .

Simultaneous disruption of both of these complexes would cause the synthetic phenotypes . This would explain the genetic interactions of CCZ1 with PEP12 , VPS21 , VPS9 and VPS45 , and , similarly , of MON1 and YPT7 with PEP12 . The ccz1 D pep12 D cells exhibit severe defects in endocytosis Previously , we analyzed the secretion of CPY in a ccz1 D strain ( Kucharczyk et al . , 2000 ) . This enzyme is present in the endoplasmic reticulum in the so - called p1 form , which is then transported to the Golgi , and there further glycosy - lated , resulting in an inactive precursor termed p2CPY . This precursor is trafﬁcked from the Golgi to the vacuole via the late endosome . Upon entry into the vacuole , p2CPY is proteolytically cleaved to the active , mature form , mCPY ( Bryant & Stevens , 1998 ) . Disruption of the VPS pathway results in the accumulation of p2CPY : strains defective in the Golgi - to - endosome stage of the VPS pathway secrete p2CPY ( Burd et al . , 1997 ) , while strains that are defective in the endosome - to - vacuole step of the pathway retain p2CPY intracellularly , trapped in prevacuolar transport intermedi - ates ( Darsow et al . , 1997 ) . Our results demonstrated that the ccz1 D mutation causes the secretion of small amounts of p2CPY . Secretion of p2CPY in the ccz1 D strain – in addition to measurable intracellular accumulation , which results from a block in vacuolar fusion – also indicated a defect in the entry of p2CPY into the late endosome in this mutant ( Kucharczyk et al . , 2000 ) . In order to determine whether Ccz1p function is required for transport of vesicles carrying endocytic cargo with the late endosome , the steady state of Ste2 - GFP localization was tested in single and double mutants . Ste2 - GFP , a chimeric variant of Ste2p , a signaling receptor that is internalized into the endocytic pathway ( Hicke & Riezman , 1996 ) , is pack - aged into endosomal vesicles and delivered to the vacuole lumen through the late endosome / prevacuolar compart - ment ( Odorizzi et al . , 1998 ) . Thus , it serves as an endocytic marker . We looked at the localization of Ste2 - GFP in single and double mutants cultured at 28 1 C and after 30 min of incubation at 37 1 C . In wild - type and syn8 D mutant cells , Ste2 - GFP was transported effectively to the vacuole lumen at both temperatures ( Fig . 4 , not shown ) , whereas in the ccz1 D mutant transport of the protein was blocked at the late endosomes and introduction of the syn8 D mutation had no additional effect . The single pep12 D mutant displayed a very severe defect even at the permissive temperature , as the marker protein was present mainly in very small vesicles dispersed in the whole cell , probably early endosomes . In about 15 % of the cells , the late - endosome / prevacuolar Fig . 4 . Transport of cargo by receptor - mediated endocytosis .

Kucharczyk et al . compartments were also ﬂuorescent . This is in agreement with the data presented by Gerrard et al . ( 2000 ) , implicating a block in trafﬁc from early to late endosomes in this mutant . In the double - mutant ccz1 D pep12 D , we observed an enhanced defect in Ste2 - GFP localization . The diffusible pattern of ﬂuorescence in these cells indicated that both Ccz1p and Pep12p are needed for efﬁcient transit of Ste2 - GFP from early to late endosomes . To conﬁrm that the block in endocytic transport occurs at the late endosome , we exploited the phenotype of cells depleted of the VPS27 gene . vps27 D cells show a defect in trafﬁc out of the late endosome , both in retrograde trafﬁc to the late Golgi as well as in forward transport to the vacuole . As a result , these cells exhibit an enlarged late endosome ( class E compartment ) in which vacuolar proteins and endocytosed cargo accumulate ( Piper et al . , 1995 ; Bryant et al . , 1998 ) . By genetic crosses , we constructed the following double and triple mutants : vps27 D ccz1 D vps27 D syn8 D vps27 D pep12 D , vps27 D ccz1 D syn8 D and vps27 D ccz1 D pep12 D . The rate of FM4 - 64 endocytosis in single , double and triple mutants is presented in Fig . 5 . In wild - type cells , after 20 min of chase , the FM4 - 64 dye was present in endosomes , and in the vacuole membrane after 60 min . The same trend was observed for syn8 D cells . In ccz1 D single - mutant cells , the transport to the endosomes pro - ceeded efﬁciently , because after 20 min of chase the dye was mainly in the late endosomes ( 2 – 5 per cell ) , but trafﬁc from the endosomes was delayed – after 60 min the dye was still in the endosomes and reached the vacuole membrane only after 120 min . In pep12 D as in wild - type cells , after 20 min of chase the dye was in early and late endosomes ; after 60 min of chase , most of the dye was located in the vacuole Fig . 5 . Endocytosis of the FM4 - 64 dye into the enlarged late endosomes in the vps27 D strain background . Logarithmic cultures were stained on ice with FM4 - 64 as described in Materials and methods , transferred to fresh medium and chased at 28 1 C . Samples of cells were drawn at the indicated time points , placed on slides and immediately viewed .

The double - mutant cells ccz1 D syn8 D did not differ from the ccz1 D mutant , but in the double - mutant ccz1 D pep12 D we observed an enhancement in the defect at 20 min of chase – in most cells diffusible ﬂuorescence was observed , indicating that the dye was still blocked in the early endosomes . The vps27 D mutant transported FM4 - 64 to the enlarged class E compartment during the ﬁrst 20 min of the chase and after 60 min the dye localized mainly to the enlarged endosome with some signal in the vacuolar membrane . We observed a different ﬂuorescence proﬁle after introduction of the vps27 D mutation into the analyzed mutants . In vps27 D pep12 D cells , the trafﬁcking of the dye to the endosomes is less efﬁcient , or the morphology of endosomes is altered due to the pep12 D mutation , because at 60 min the ﬂuorescence signal is still present in small vesicles whereas the enlarged class E compartment is invisible in contrast to faint ﬂuores - cence in the vacuolar membrane . In vps27 D ccz1 D cells , the defect is stronger – a weak vesicular signal was observed at all time points , and some enlarged endosomes were visible after 60 and 120 min . These results show that in the double mutants , the trafﬁc from early to late endosomes was delayed as compared with the single mutants , indicating that Ccz1p , as Pep12p , is involved in this transport step . Introduction of the vps27 D mutation into the ccz1 D pep12 D and ccz1 D syn8 D mutants signiﬁcantly intensiﬁed the defects in FM4 - 64 endocytosis – we observed a more diffuse labeling pattern . After 20 min , we did not observe any signal in the enlarged endosomes ; neither did the staining pattern change during the next 40 min of chase . This indicates that these cells are either not efﬁcient in forming an enlarged endosome as seen in the vps27 D cells or that trafﬁcking to this endosomal compartment is compromised , or both . Analysis of FM4 - 64 trafﬁcking in ccz1 D vps27 D cells ( Fig . 5 ) demonstrated that the ccz1 D mutation slows down the transport of the dye to the enlarged endosomes , although the internalization step proceeds normally ( not shown ) . A kinetic delay in endocytosis in the ccz1 D strain has been demonstrated previously ( Kucharczyk et al . , 2000 ) , but it was considered a result of the vacuolar fusion defect . Now we have shown that a defect occurs also at the endosomal fusion step . Together with CPY secretion in the ccz1 D mutant ( Kucharczyk et al . , 2000 ) , these experiments indicate that Ccz1p function is required for efﬁcient entry of both biosynthetic and endocytic cargo into the late endosome . The synthetic phenotypic enhancement , along with the two - hybrid interactions , implies that a functional relationship exists between endosomal / TGN t - SNAREs and the Ccz1p – Mon1p complex . In this work , we show that the Ccz1p – Mon1p complex is involved in fusion at the endosomal membrane , in addition to its established function in vacuolar fusion . For Ccz1p this is the third potential site of action , because on the basis of genetic interactions between CCZ1 , ARL1 and YPT1 it has already been postulated to also function in Golgi trafﬁcking ( Love et al . , 2004 ; Hoffman - Sommer et al . , 2005 ) . We thus provide a further example of the promiscuity of the mem - brane fusion machinery , components of which are often present and active in multiple sites in the cell . This report supports the notion that the speciﬁcity of membrane fusion depends on a complicated network of protein interactions . Acknowledgements We thank D . Urban - Grimal , R . Piper and S .
