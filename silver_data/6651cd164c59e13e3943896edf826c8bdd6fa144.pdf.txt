Prolonged febrile seizures in early childhood ( FS ) constitute an initial precipitating insult ( IPI ) commonly associated with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy ( MTLE ) . FS - MTLE patients may have early disease onset , i . e . just after the IPI , in early childhood , or late - onset , ranging from mid - adolescence to early adult life . The mechanisms governing early ( E ) or late ( L ) disease onset are largely unknown . In order to unveil the molecular path - ways underlying E and L subtypes of FS - MTLE we investigated global gene expression in hippocampal CA3 explants of FS - MTLE patients submitted to hippocampectomy . Gene coexpression networks ( GCNs ) were obtained for the E and L patient groups . A network - based approach for GCN analysis was employed allowing : i ) the visualization and analy - sis of differentially expressed ( DE ) and complete ( CO ) - all valid GO annotated transcripts - GCNs for the E and L groups ; ii ) the study of interactions between all the system ’ s con - stituents based on community detection and coarse - grained community structure meth - ods . We found that the E - DE communities with strongest connection weights harbor highly connected genes mainly related to neural excitability and febrile seizures , whereas in L - DE communities these genes are not only involved in network excitability but also playing roles in other epilepsy - related processes . Inversely , in E - CO the strongly con - nected communities are related to compensatory pathways ( seizure inhibition , neuronal survival and responses to stress conditions ) while in L - CO these communities harbor sev - eral genes related to pro - epileptic effects , seizure - related mechanisms and vulnerability to epilepsy . These results fit the concept , based on fMRI and behavioral studies , that early PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0128174 May 26 , 2015 1 / 37 a11111 OPEN ACCESS Citation : Moreira - Filho CA , Bando SY , Bertonha FB , Iamashita P , Silva FN , Costa LdF , et al .

FNS and PI were funded by Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de onset epilepsies , although impacting more severely the hippocampus , are associated to compensatory mechanisms , while in late MTLE development the brain is less able to gen - erate adaptive mechanisms , what has implications for epilepsy management and drug discovery . Introduction Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with childhood febrile seizures ( FS - MTLE ) is a distinctive entity that can be delineated from afebrile MTLE as demonstrated by epidemiological [ 1 ] , radiologi - cal [ 2 ] , and genomic [ 3 , 4 ] studies . The age at onset in FS - MTLE is trimodal , with peaks at early childhood , adolescence , and early adult - life [ 5 ] . The age of seizure onset exerts a relevant impact on brain activity and connectivity because epilepsy - associated processes interfere with normal brain developmental changes , as evidenced by fMRI and network ( graph theory ) computational studies of brain connectivity [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] . These studies show that late - onset MTLE causes more pronounced neuronal network alterations ( whole - brain properties ) , since the ma - ture brain has a diminished capacity to generate adaptive responses to epilepsy effects , whereas in early - onset MTLE several compensatory mechanisms are activated in the more plastic youn - ger brain . On the other hand , early MTLE onset is associated to a more severe functional ab - normality in the ictal hippocampus ( local alteration ) [ 8 ] , what is in agreement with the inverse correlation between age of seizure onset and severity of mesial temporal sclerosis [ 9 ] . About 40 % of the patients with FS - MTLE develop refractory epilepsy [ 10 ] and early onset of seizures is a predictive factor for pharmacoresistancy [ 11 , 12 ] . Prolonged febrile seizures ( FS ) and febrile status epilepticus ( FSE ) in early childhood have long been associated to a higher risk of temporal lobe epilepsy and mesial temporal sclerosis , but a causal relationship was just recently established , based on epidemiological and imaging investigations , as well as on studies with animal models ( reviewed in [ 13 ] ) . FS and FSE can cause hippocampal injury due to the interplay between inflammation and fever : fever increases neuronal firing and causes the overexpression of inflammatory molecules ( IL - 1 β , TNF - α , HMGB1 ) , leading to neuronal injury , neuronal excitability and epileptogenesis [ 14 , 15 , 16 ] . Studies in animal models showed that a single episode of neonatal seizure permanently alters glutamatergic synapses [ 17 ] . In fact , initial precipitating injuries , such as complex febrile sei - zures , are potent inducers of epigenetic alterations that modify brain functioning [ 18 ] . It was shown that DNA methylation is an early event triggered by FSE that may persists late in the ep - ileptic hippocampus , leading to permanent changes in gene expression [ 19 ] . The predisposition to developing temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis has been investigated in animal models of FS induced by hyperthermia and in prospective clinical studies of children with FSE . Altogether , these studies revealed that FS development and subse - quent epilepsy results from a combination of environmental and genetic factors that vary in each individual [ 13 , 20 , 21 ] . In rodent models of FS - like seizures induced by hyperthermia , a quite regular latency period between the initial insult and the development of recurrent seizures is always observed [ 22 ] , but in human FS - MTLE the age at onset varies from early childhood to adult life [ 5 , 1 ] . The mechanisms governing early ( E ) or late ( L ) disease onset in FS - MTLE are largely unknown but their unraveling is crucial , since the latent period could be a therapeutic window for developing antiepileptogenic drugs [ 23 ] . In order to look into the molecular mechanisms leading to early or late FS - MTLE onset , we have decided to investigate comparatively the hippocampal CA3 transcriptional profile of Transcriptional Modules in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0128174 May 26 , 2015 2 / 37 Nivel Superior ( CAPES ) . FNS , CAM - F and LdFC are funded by FAPESP - MCT / CNPq / PRONEX grant 2011 / 50761 - 2 . Competing Interests : The authors have declared that no competing interests exist . a group of FS - MTLE patients where all individuals had their IPI before 4 years of age but who developed MTLE in early childhood or in mid - adolescence and adult life . Our rationale was based on the evidences that FS - induced epigenetic changes produce lasting effects on gene expression in human hippocampus , and in the tenets of network medicine : i ) genes do not operate in isolation but as components of complex networks [ 24 , 25 , 26 ] ; ii ) genomic in - teraction data is basically composed of pairwise relationships among transcriptional modules ( network communities [ 27 ] ) ; iii ) complex diseases rarely derive from alterations in a single gene but , on the contrary , reflect perturbations in cell ’ s genomic and protein - protein interac - tion networks , often caused by environmental factors [ 28 , 29 , 30 ] . Therefore , we sought to find out how FS , an initial precipitating insult of environmental origin , differentially impact - ed hippocampal CA3 gene coexpression networks of FS - MTLE patients with early or late dis - ease onset . Conceivably , different precipitating insult effects on disease onset could arise from pre - existent CA3 gene network differences between E and L patients , due to inherited genetic differences , or stem from different network adaptations to the insult , also influenced by allelic differences among individuals . In order to investigate this issue , gene expression data was analyzed using network science parameters , i . e . with emphasis in complex network visualization , gene hierarchy categorization , community detection and coarse - grained com - munity structure [ 4 , 26 , 31 , 32 ] . Material and Methods Patients Ethics Statement . The patients with refractory MTLE and febrile IPI included in this study were selected through the CInAPCe - FAPESP Program ( www . fapesp . br / en / ; www . cinapce . org . br ) . This research has been approved by the research ethics committees of Hospital das Clínicas da FMUSP and of Hospital Albert Einstein under numbers 251 / 05 and CAEE 0122 . 0 . 028 . 174 . 05 respectively . A written informed consent was obtained from all patients . Refractory epilepsy cases were defined as those who have not gained seizure control after treatment with three or more anticonvulsant drugs . In the last 3 – 4 years before surgery , seizure control was attempted with carbamazepine , oxicarbazepine , phenobarbital , cloba - zam , topiramate , and lamotrigine , in different drug combinations . The patients were submit - ted to clinical , electrophysiological , neuropsychological and neuroimaging evaluations before surgery . All patients included in this study ( Table 1 ) had prolonged febrile seizures as the IPI at or before the age of 4 years . Early onset patients were those who developed the dis - ease soon after the IPI , whereas the late onset patients developed the disease after (cid:1) 13 years old . In the present investigation we compared global gene expression profiles of CA3 ex - plants obtained at surgery room from seven early - onset ( group E ) and seven late - onset RMTLE patients ( group L ) submitted to corticoamigdalohippocampectomy . E and L groups had the same gender composition : three males and four females . Hippocampal hypersignal was observed in T2 - weighted MRimages in all cases , what is a hallmark of hippocampal scle - rosis [ 33 ] . MRI evidence indicated that six of the E patients had MTLE on the right side and one on the left side , whereas five of the L patients had MTLE on the left side and two on the right side . Patients with bilateral hippocampal sclerosis , lesions other than hippocampal scle - rosis ( tumors , dysplasias , etc ) , and psychiatric disorders were not included in this study . No significant group differences were found for epilepsy duration or age at surgery between E and L groups ( S1 Fig ) . All surgical specimens were classified as ILAE type 1 hippocampal sclerosis [ 34 ] , that is , severe neuronal cell loss and gliosis predominantly in CA1 and CA4 regions .

MRI and histological studies were performed in all removed hippocampi for neuropathology analysis and for confirming that the explants for genomic studies were obtained at the proper site [ 2 , 3 ] . RNA extraction Brain tissue explants from CA3 ( 3 – 4 mm3 ) were homogenized with TissueRupter ( Qiagen , cat . no . 9001272 Valencia , CA ) and total RNA was extracted from the homogenates using the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Kit ( Qiagen cat . no . 74804 , Valencia , CA ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . RNA quality was assessed on the Agilent BioAnalyzer 2100 ( Agilent , Santa Clara , CA ) . All samples were stored at - 80°C until used in hybridization experiments . Microarray hybridization and gene expression analysis In order to determine gene expression profiles , 4x44K DNA microarrrays ( Whole Human Genome Microarray Kit , Agilent Technologies , cat no . G4112F , Santa Clara , CA ) were used . The procedures for hybridization followed the protocols provided by the manufacturer´s in - structions ( One - Color Microarray - Based Gene Expression Analysis — Quick Amp Labeling ) . The images were captured by the reader Agilent Bundle according to the parameters recom - mended for bioarrays and extracted by Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9 . 5 . 3 and considering spots present none or only one flag ( i . e . low intensity , saturation , controls , etc . ) . The selected transcripts were used for analysis using the R software version 2 . 11 . 1 ( R Devel - opment Core Team , 2010 ) . We identified 13 , 427 valid GO annotated genes for the CA3 sam - ples ( early - and late - onset patients ) . By means of the TMEV software version 4 . 6 . 1 we obtained the differentially expressed ( DE ) Gene Ontology ( GO ) annotated genes using the t - test ( P < 0 . 05 ) .

Differential gene expression data were validated through quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction [ 3 ] . Gene coexpression networks ( GCNs ) : visualization , analysis and community detection Gene coexpression networks for differentially expressed GO annotated genes ( DE ) and for all valid GO annotated genes ( CO ) were constructed for E and L groups based on Pearson ’ s corre - lation , as we previously described [ 4 ] . Pearson ’ s correlation identifies sets of genes which covar - ies ( positively or negatively ) , thus allowing us to construct networks by considering nodes as genes , with edges inferred if a pair presents high absolute value of correlation . Specifically , we define a correlation threshold that determines if edges are present or absent in the resulting network . This is done in a way that all nodes are connected to the major component and the network is stable in the sense that slight changes in the threshold value do not significantly af - fect its topological structure [ 4 ] . Networks were tested for scale free status by Kolmogorov - Smirnov ( K - S ) statistics , i . e . power law distributions in empirical data [ 35 ] . As these networks may grow larger in the number of components ( e . g . tens of thousands genes ) or present very intricate connections between them ( such as hierarchical or modular structure ) , it becomes mandatory the use of tools and methodologies borrowed from network science to better characterize such systems . We developed a network methodology for GCN visualization ( 3D ) and analysis [ 4 ] that al - lows the categorization of network nodes according to node - centered connectivity taken along distinct hierarchical levels of gene - gene neighborhoods [ 36 , 37 ] : hubs are highly con - nected nodes , VIPs — standing for “ Very Important Person ” , an acronym initially coined for the study of social networks [ 38 ] and equivalent to the term “ date - hubs ” in biological net - work papers [ 39 ] — have low node degree but connect only with hubs , and high - hubs have VIP status and high overall number of connections . We classified network nodes as VIPs , hubs or high - hubs by obtaining the node degree , k 0 , and the first level concentric node de - gree , k 1 , which takes into account all node connections leaving from its immediate neighbor - hood , then projecting all node values in a k 0 vs k 1 graphic . All calculations were done by using Python program and the conceptual framework is described at http : / / cyvision . if . sc . usp . br / ~ bant / hierarchical / . Connectivity . The network connectivity k for non - directed networks was calculated by k = 2L / N , where L stands for the number of edges and N for the number of nodes [ 40 ] . Community detection . Community detection in complex networks is usually accom - plished by discovering the network modular structure that optimizes the modularity measure - ment . Modularity takes into account the relationship between the number of links inside a community and between nodes in distinct communities compared to the random model [ 27 ; 40 ] . A diverse range of optimization techniques exist to optimize the modularity . Here we ap - plied the method proposed by Blondel et al . [ 41 ] which attains good modularity values and presents excellent performance . Coarse - grained community structure . As a complementary analysis for the community detection , each GCN was rearranged in a new network accounting only for the relationships between each community , also known as coarse - grained community structure ( CGCS ) [ 42 ] . Here the CGCS was generated by contracting all nodes inside each community into a single community node , likewise , edges are added up as connection weights between such communi - ties . This structure can also be obtained directly by considering the mixing matrix [ 27 ] as an adjacency matrix of the new network . Transcriptional Modules in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0128174 May 26 , 2015 5 / 37 Interactome analysis The interactome networks were constructed using an in house free web tool developed by Le - andro de A . Lima and Renato D . Puga — Centro Internacional de Pesquisa e Ensino ( CIPE ) — Hospital A . C . Camargo ( http : / / bioinfo . lbhc . hcancer . org . br / cgi - bin / interactomegraph / index . cgi ) . Only genes categorized as hubs , VIPs or high hubs were considered in this analysis . MINT and IntAct databases ( experimentally verified protein - protein interactions ) were selected for comparison and data generation . Data analysis and visualization were accomplished through Cytoscape ( version 3 . 1 . 0 , www . cytoscape . org ) . Results GCN analyses In the E versus L comparison , 761 DE genes were found to be upregulated and three were downregulated in the E group . Gene coexpression networks ( GCNs ) were inferred for E and L groups using DE or CO ( encompassing all 13 , 427 valid transcripts ) subsets of genes through Pearson ’ s correlation method . A 0 . 965 link - strength cut - off was adopted for DE networks . The resulting DE networks had 621 genes and 1367 links for the E - DE group , or 703 genes and 3 , 206 links for the L - DE group . We adopted a higher link - strength cut - off ( 0 . 998 ) to finalize the CO networks , which had 9 , 578 genes and 32 , 807 links for the E - CO group , or 11 , 321 genes and 76 , 711 links for CT group . All networks were validated as scale - free networks as seen in a normalized degree distribution log - log plot : DE and CO networks are shown in Figs 1 and 2 , respectively . In these figures the nodes ( genes ) are depicted in different colors corresponding to their hierarchical level : blue for hubs , red for VIPs , and green for high - hubs . Gene categoriza - tion as hubs , VIPs , and high hubs , with their corresponding k 0 and k 1 values and biological function appear in Table 2 ( DE networks ) and Table 3 ( CO networks ) . Connectivity . E networks exhibited lower connectivity when compared to L networks . The k values for these four networks were : E - DE = 4 . 40 ; E - CO = 6 . 85 ; L - DE = 9 . 12 ; L - CO = 13 . 55 . Community detection . An overall picture of DE gene communities ( modules ) is depicted in Fig 3A for E - DE and in Fig 4A for L - DE networks . Different node colors identify the distinct gene communities in each network . Fig 3B , Fig 4B and 4C present , respectively , E - DE and L - DE hierarchy - categorized selected nodes identified by their corresponding GO gene symbols . Symbol letter colors indicate hubs ( blue ) , VIPs ( red ) or high hubs ( green ) . E - CO and L - CO networks , respective communities , and hierarchy - categorized selected nodes can be properly visualized only in 3D and are shown in S1 and S2 Videos . DE and CO networks presented good quality of community structure and modularity values were quite similar for all networks : E - DE = 0 . 657 ; L - DE = 0 . 530 ; E - CO = 0 . 514 ; L - CO = 0 . 506 . It is interesting to note that the E - CO network has more gene communities ( 24 ) than the L - CO network ( 16 ) as depicted in Fig 5A and 5B respectively . Fig 5C shows the number of nodes per community in each of the CO networks . E networks ( DE and CO ) have lower connectivity and their communities are more sparsely connected , what may indicate a higher grade of dysregulation in cell ’ s functional orga - nization [ 4 , 43 ] . A set of simulations run with slightly different link - strength thresholds ( from 0 . 930 up to 0 . 980 for DE networks , and from 0 . 990 up to 0 . 998 for CO networks ) did not reveal alterations in community structure , thus indicating its robustness . Community structure analysis of transcriptional networks This section portrays the biological functions of selected hubs , VIPs and high - hubs in the con - text of the distinct gene communities , i . e . transcriptional modules , found in DE and CO net - works generated for E and L groups . Coarse - grained community structure ( CGCS ) was obtained Transcriptional Modules in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0128174 May 26 , 2015 6 / 37 for each network , yielding the relationships between each community in the network ( Fig 6 ) . Communities with the strongest connection weights ( fraction of edges linking distinct commu - nities ) hold the most significant functional interactions in the network [ 30 , 44 , 45 ] . Therefore , the subsequent analysis of gene communities in DE and CO networks was performed consider - ing not only the gene / node hierarchy but , and principally , the networks ’ CGCS . E - DE network . This network encompasses 14 gene communities , of which 10 contain high hierarchy nodes / genes — categorized as hubs , VIPs or high - hubs — with high network cen - trality ( Fig 3A , 3B and Table 2 ) . Most of these high hierarchy genes play relevant roles in epi - lepsy and brain functioning . These roles will be analyzed below in the setting of gene community relationships . In the E - DE network communities C and I have the strongest con - nection weights ( Fig 6A ) , followed by communities A and B . Community C harbors six E - DE high hierarchy genes and four of them are related to neuro - nal excitability . Two of these genes are VIPs : SCN9A , which codes for Na v 1 . 7 sodium channel and whose allelic variants are implicated in genetic epilepsies with febrile seizures [ 46 , 47 ] and RTN2 , also a VIP in L - DE network module C , a regulator of the trafficking and function of glu - tamate transporter EAAC1 ( excitatory amino acid carrier 1 ) [ 48 ] ; dysregulation of EAAC1 was reported in experimental models of epilepsy and also in the hippocampus of temporal lobe epi - lepsy ( TLE ) patients [ 49 ] . The third gene , BAIAP2 , is a high - hub . This gene codes for an adap - tor protein ( IRSp53 ) involved in the regulation of NMDA receptor - mediated excitatory synaptic transmission , long - term potentiation , and learning and memory [ 50 ] .

The fourth gene in this functional group , BRUNOL5 , aliase CELF5 , codes for a member of the CELF - Bruno Like family of RNA - binding proteins . BRUNOL5 expression is restricted to brain [ 52 ] . CELF proteins share struc - tural and functional redundancy . Human BRUNOL4 , closely related to BRUNOL5 [ 48 ] , is in - volved in fine - tuning synaptic transmission and its deficiency causes recurrent seizures in mice and man [ 53 ] . The remaining two genes in community C are high - hubs : AVIL codes for advillin , an actin binding protein , and regulates neurite outgrowth [ 54 , 55 ] ; and FLJ37078 encodes a hitherto uncharacterized protein . In community I all four high hierarchy genes are clearly related to febrile seizures , synaptic activity and epilepsy . EGR4 , a hub , mediates BNDF induction of neuronal KCC2 ( potassium chloride cotransporter 2 ) transcription [ 56 ] . KCC2 variants determine susceptibility to febrile seizures [ 57 ] . KCN3 , a VIP , codes for a potassium channel related to febrile seizures and synap - tic excitability [ 58 , 59 , 60 ] . B3GALTN1 , also a VIP , glycosylates and promotes heteromerization of HCN1 - HCN2 channels in hippocampus upon seizure activity , thus enhancing network ex - citability [ 61 ] . MTA1 , a high - hub , and a VIP in L - DE community H , codes for a core compo - nent of NuRD ( Nucleosome Remodeling and histone Deacetylation ) complex [ 62 ] , where it enhances histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) 1 and 2 activity in order to repress gene expression [ 63 ] . HDAC2 — the target of the antiepileptic drug Valproate — is overexpressed in the brain of TLE patients and its transcriptional repression activity plays an important role in the patho - genesis of epilepsy [ 64 ] .

In each of the four networks only the top nine communities in number of nodes ( A to I ) were considered for this analysis , except for communities J and S in the E - CO network ( C ) , since these communities contain relevant hubs . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0128174 . g006 Transcriptional Modules in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0128174 May 26 , 2015 16 / 37 ( aliase NIDD ) is a VIP and codes for a DHHC - containing protein involved in : i ) regulation of cell surface expression of calcium - activated potassium ( BK ) channels [ 76 ] ; ii ) regulation of NO signaling pathways at postsynaptic sites [ 77 ] ; iii ) control of neuronal hiperexcitability via BK channels [ 78 ] . Interestingly , a seizure — related down regulation of BK channel protein levels was described in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy [ 79 ] , indicating a role for BK and NIDD in MTLE . The high hub KRT14 , codes for keratin 14 and modulates Notch signaling [ 80 ] . Notch signaling is up - regulated in temporal lobe epilepsy ( reviewed in [ 81 ] ) . The remaining communities and respective high hierarchy genes are described in Table 2 . Here is worth to mention here community H , which harbors GTF3C1 ( aliase TFIIIC ) a gene that regulates the rearrangement of nuclear architecture allowing the coordinated expression of activity - dependent neuronal genes [ 82 ] . This gene controls the expression of BAIAP2 , which is high hub in E - DE community C . In synthesis , it is possible to say that communities C and I , which share the strongest connec - tion weights , include genes closely related to neural excitability and febrile seizures mechanisms , with relevance for SCN9A and KCCN3 , implicated in febrile seizures and synaptic excitability , followed by the regulators of synaptic excitability ( RNT2 , BAIAP2 and B3GALTN1 ) and by MTA1 , the enhancer of HDAC2 and a Valproate target . Several of the high hierarchy genes in A and B communities are also related to neuronal excitability , or to genomic mechanisms favor - ing this mechanism . The implications of these results for the development and onset age of MTLE in patients with febrile seizure history will be discussed later in this paper . L - DE network . This network ( Fig 4A – 4C ) has 10 gene communities , of which 5 ( Table 3 ) contain high hierarchy nodes ( hubs , VIPs or high - hubs ) . Here the strongest connection weights are centered in module C , which also contains most of the VIPs and high - hubs of the L - DE network , which are involved in relevant epilepsy mechanisms , as follows . Two community C VIPs , RTN2 and CACN1C , are significantly linked to neuronal excitabil - ity . RTN2 , also a VIP in E - DE network module C , is a regulator of the glutamate transporter EAAC1 [ 48 ] ; the dysregulation of EAAC1 was reported in animal models of epilepsy and in the hippocampus of TLE patients [ 49 ] . CACNA1C encodes the alpha 1C subunit of the L - type voltage - gated calcium channel Cav1 . 2 which plays relevant roles in : i ) synaptic activity - depen - dent gene expression [ 83 ] ii ) regulation of neurotransmitter release in hippocampal interneu - rons [ 84 ] ; iii ) control of neurite extension [ 85 ] . Here is very important to note that Cav1 . 2 calcium channels are temperature - sensitive and support the intrinsic firing of pyramidal neu - rons during hyperthermia , thus providing a target for the treatment of febrile seizures [ 86 ] . The VIPs RING1 , TCEA2 , FDXR , LAMA5 , and the high - hub TESC , are associated to mecha - nisms of stress response and brain homeostasis . RING1 promotes transcriptional activation / si - lencing via Polycomb [ 87 ] . TCEA2 , codes for a SII class transcription elongation factor that plays an important role in preventing cell death due to oxidative DNA damage [ 88 ] . FDXR codes for the sole human ferredoxin reductase ; it is involved in the maintenance of cytosolic and mitochondrial iron homeostasis [ 89 ] , and in cell sensitization to oxidative stress and apo - ptosis in TLE [ 90 , 91 ] . LAMA5 codes for a component of hippocampal laminin matrix essential for its dynamic structure and for neuronal survival under stress conditions , such as excitotoxi - city [ 92 ] . TESC codes for a Ca2 + binding calcineurin B - like protein involved in rapid hippo - campal network adaptation to recurring synchronous activity [ 93 ] . The other high hierarchy genes community C with functions associated to epilepsy - related mechanisms are : i ) the VIP CALM3 , that encodes a calcium signal transducer involved in the NFKB activation pathway [ 94 ] , which is dysregulated in hippocampal tissues of TLE patients [ 95 ] ; ii ) the high - hub EFHD2 ; its gene product is a conserved calcium binding protein that regu - lates F - actin access to cofilin [ 96 ] , influencing actin cytoskeleton remodeling and the excitability of epileptic hippocampus [ 97 ] , as well as astrogial loss following status epilepticus [ 98 ] ; iii ) the Transcriptional Modules in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0128174 May 26 , 2015 17 / 37 VIP RACGAP1 a constituent of the IQGAP1 — filamin - A — RacGAP1 pathway that coordinates directional cell migration [ 99 ] , which is frequently aberrant in epileptic hippocampus [ 70 , 100 ] . Although strongly connected with community C , community F ( Fig 6B ) does not harbor high hierarchy genes within the k 0 and k 1 cut - off values adopted for L - DE network ( see Fig 1D ) . A scatter plot of node degrees for module F genes and the high hierarchy genes of L - DE appear in S2 Fig Among the module F highly connected genes are : i ) CNTNAP1 , which encodes contactin associated protein1 , a member of the contactin - PTPRZ1 complex that regulates the traffic and synaptic content of AMPA glutamate receptor subunit GluA1 in hippocampal neu - rons [ 101 ] ; ii ) CCNE1 , a Sirtuin - 2 regulator [ 102 ] and iii ) PKIG which encodes a protein kinase involved in endothelial barrier function [ 103 ] . Remarkably , GluA1 hippocampal expression is altered during status epilepticus [ 101 , 104 ] , MTLE patients show reduced hippocampal expres - sion of Sirtuin - 2 [ 75 ] , and endothelial barrier function is altered in epilepsy [ 105 ] . The other significant connections of community C ( Fig 6B ) occur with community A — where are located SNX25 and ARPC5L , markers of intractable epilepsy — and with communities H and B which harbor , respectively , the genes MTA1 ( a high - hub in E - DE community I , functionally described above ) and RBPL1 , regulators of two epilepsy - associated genes ( HDAC2 and PAX6 , targets of the antiepileptic drug Valproate ) . The hub SNX25 codes for Sorting Nexin 25 , a PX do - main protein which modulates TGF - beta signaling pathway and is involved in epileptogenesis and TLE development [ 106 ] . SNX25 is a biomarker of intractable epilepsy , being overexpressed in TLE patients [ 106 ] . ARPC5L encodes an Arp2 / 3 complex protein involved in actin polymeri - zation [ 107 ] and in the control of neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons [ 108 ] . Arp2 / 3 ex - pression is increased in the temporal lobe cortex of intractable epilepsy patients [ 109 ] . RLBP1 encodes the retinaldehyde binding protein 1 , a retinoic acid ( RA ) signalling molecule . It is note - worthy that RA - signalling promotes the expression of PAX6 [ 110 ] , which is a candidate gene for epilepsy [ 111 ] and whose expression on neuronal cells may be altered by Valproate [ 112 ] . The overall picture that emerged from the analysis of community relationships in L - DE is somewhat different from that obtained for E - DE . There is a quite dissimilar functional scenario and also different key players ( excepting for RTN2 , B4GALT2 and MTA1 ) . Here community C — which centers the strongest connection weights , — harbors most of the VIPs and high - hubs , what indicates that this community is essential for keeping L - DE network stability and func - tionality . Contrarily to the C - I excitability axis in E - DE , only part of the genes in L - DE commu - nity C , such as CACNA1C and RNT2 , is associated to neuronal excitability . In fact , a sizable number of genes are related to stress response and brain homeostasis , and others to different epilepsy - associated mechanisms , including those related to cytoskeleton and cell migration . The communities F and A , both strongly connected with community A , harbor genes involved in different biological process with relevancy for epilepsy , like CNTAP1 , a regulator of GluA1 , and the two markers of intractable epilepsy , SNX25 and ARPCL5 . The community detection data for L - DE and E - DE networks will be considered comparatively in the Discussion section . E - CO network . The complete gene coexpression network for the E group encompasses 24 gene communities of which only 7 contain high hierarchy nodes ( Figs 2B and 5A ) with high network centrality ( S1 Video ) . In this network the strongest connection weights involve com - munities D and C , followed by communities H and B ( Fig 6C ) . It is noteworthy that communi - ties C , D and H concentrate all the VIPs and high - hubs of E - CO network . The summarized functional description of all high hierarchy genes contained in E - CO appears in Table 3 . Community C includes five high hierarchy genes related to brain homeostasis and regula - tion of neuronal gene expression : BDP1 , MCTS1 , ANKS1B , GRLF1 and PCF11 . BDP1 ( aliase TFIIIB ) is a hub and codes for a subunit of the TFIIIB transcription initiation complex , being an essential component of human TFIIIC activity [ 113 , 114 ] . TFIIIC regulates the coordinat - ed expression of activity - dependent neuronal genes , such as BAIAP2 [ 82 ] , a high - hub in Transcriptional Modules in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0128174 May 26 , 2015 18 / 37 E - DE community C . The VIP MCTS1 ( aliase MCT1 ) codes for a carboxylate transporter and its deficiency was observed in human epileptogenic hippocampus [ 115 ] . MCTS1 is involved in TLE ( and especially in MTLE ) by influencing brain energy homeostasis , mitochondrial function GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission and flux of lactate through the brain [ 116 , 117 ] . ANKS1B ( aliase AIDA1 ) , a high - hub , codes for a postsynaptic scaffolding protein that links persistent signal events occurring at neuronal synapse with global changes in gene expression [ 118 ] . The high - hubs GRLF1 ( aliase ARHGAP35 ) and PCF11 codes , respectively , for a Rho - GTPase involved in the promotion of neurite outgrowth [ 119 ] and for a 3 ’ - end pro - cessing factor that enhances RNA polymerase II nascent RNA degradation and transcription - al termination [ 120 ] . The high hierarchy genes of community D are mostly involved in responses to stress and neuronal survival . Two high - hubs , DNJB2 and MTR have relevant roles in this task . DNJB2 ( aliase HSP70 ) , codes for a heat - shock protein expressed in hippocampal neurons . HSP70 is a well - known stress marker of TLE ; its expression before insult improves neuronal survival [ 121 ] . MTR codes for the enzyme 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate - homocysteine methyltransferase . This enzyme regulates the brain levels of homocysteine , an excitatory amino acid , protecting hippocampal neurons against oxidative stress [ 122 , 123 ] . Two VIPs are also involved in re - sponses to stress : RPL6 whose gene product is ribosomal protein L6 , a regulator of the HDM2 — p53 pathway in response to ribosomal stress [ 124 ] ; and DTWD2 , coding for prothymosin alpha , a highly acidic nuclear protein of the alpha - thymosin family involved in response to oxi - dative stress and neuronal survival [ 125 ] . Finally , two hubs , C6orf25 and PNPLA7 , are also re - lated to protective roles . C6orf 25 ( aliase G6bB ) encodes an inhibitory platelet receptor bearing ITAM and ITIM motifs and it is involved in the modulation of microglia - neuron interaction [ 126 , 127 , 128 ] . PNPLA7 codes for a patatin - like phospholipase , structurally similar to PNPLA6 , involved in lipid and energy homeostasis [ 129 ] and possibly involved in axonal and synaptic integrity [ 130 , 131 ] . Community H encompasses set of three VIPs , four high - hubs and one hub , all exerting im - portant roles in neuroprotection , modulation of neuronal excitability , and seizure inhibition . These genes are in the following described according to their hierarchic category and biological functions VIPs : SMA4 ( aliase SMN1 ) codes for the survival motor neuron ( SMN ) protein and modu - lates neuronal survival cooperating with PP4R2 ( a regulatory subunit of phosphatase 4 ) [ 132 ] . RAD54L2 ( aliase ARIP4 ) encodes a chromatin remodeling factor that interacts with serine / threonine kinase DIRK1A ( minibrain kinase ) modulating excitation / inhibition balance in hip - pocampal neurons towards seizure inhibition [ 133 ] . ELF2 codes for an E1f transcription factor and promotes cell survival under cytokine stress ( a condition present in MTLE ) by increasing valosin - containing protein ( VCP ) expression [ 134 ] . Here is interesting to note that hippocam - pal valosin is vulnerable to oxidative stress in excitotoxin - induced neuronal injury [ 135 ] . High - hubs : ATF4 codes for a transcription factor mediating neuronal resistance against oxi - dative stress [ 136 , 137 ] . Interestingly , ATF4 expression is regulated by ELF2 [ 138 ] , a VIP in this community ( see above ) Moreover , ATF4 is involved in the differential control of hippo - campal GABABR1a and GABABR1b Subunit Gene Expression through Alternative Promoters [ 139 ] . LENG1 codes for the leukocyte receptor cluster ( LRC ) member 1 with uncharacterized function in brain [ 140 ] . YKT6 codes for an evolutionary conserved SNARE essential for ER - Gogi transport , highly expressed in neurons and enriched in hippocampus [ 141 ] . YKT6 is co - upregulated with S100B ( a VIP in L - CO network , module C ) upon seizures [ 142 ] . SER - PINB2 is one of the nine hippocampal core genes for synaptic activity - induced neuroprotection against seizure - induced brain - damage [ 143 ] . These genes are collectively termed Activity - regu - lated Inhibitor of Death ( AID ) genes . All AID genes are activated by calcium signaling [ 143 ] . Transcriptional Modules in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0128174 May 26 , 2015 19 / 37 Hub : ASPA codes for aspartoacylase , an enzyme that catabolizes NAA ( N - acetyil - L - aspartic acid ) in oligodendrocytes and is responsive to glutamatergic activity [ 144 ] . Decreased NAA levels in hippocampal CA3 are characteristic of MTLE [ 145 ] . Community B contains three hubs and their biological functions are detailed here . DPYD codes for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase , an enzyme involved in pyrimidine catabolism which also modulates the production of beta - alanine , a neuromodulator of inhibitory trans - mission in the brain [ 146 ] . Altered function of DYPD is associated with seizures [ 147 ] and in - tellectual disability [ 148 ] . STX6 codes for syntaxin 6 , a t - SNARE family member that regulates intracellular membrane trafficking [ 149 ] ; DST , encodes a large multidomain cytoskeletal - asso - ciated protein essential for maintaining neuronal cytoskeleton organization [ 150 ] . Finally , also depicted in Fig 6C are communities J and S , where two relevant hubs are locat - ed . Community J harbors the hub RPL34 , which encodes ribosomal protein L34 , a Cdk5 inhibi - tor [ 151 ] . Cdk5 is a mediator of neuronal death and survival [ 152 ] and is involved in cell degeneration in hippocampal neurons after an excitotoxic injury [ 153 ] . Community S has the hub RBMX , a gene coding for a RNA binding motif protein involved in the promotion of neur - ite growth [ 154 ] . Neurite growth is a hallmark of TLE [ 155 ] . Altogether , E - CO network most connected communities encompass genes predominantly related to compensatory pathways in epilepsy ( seizure inhibition , neuronal survival and re - sponses to stress conditions ) . These genes are concentrated in communities C , D and H , which also contain all VIPs and high - hubs in this network , pointing out for the role of those genes in supporting network stability . This issue will be further developed in the Discussion section . L - CO network . The complete gene coexpression network for the L group has 16 gene communities ) of which only 5 contain high hierarchy nodes ( Fig 2D ) with high network cen - trality ( S2 Video ) . In this network the strongest weight connections are centered in community F and between the communities C and D ( Fig 6D ) . Community F contains two VIPs and one hub whose altered expression is associated with pro - epileptic effects . The most relevant of these gene is SLC6A1 ( aliase GAT1 ) , which codes for GABA transporter 1 ( GAT1 ) , a major GABA transporter in the brain [ 156 ] . In the epileptogenic sclerotic hippocampus of MTLE pa - tients the expression of GAT1 is decreased in CA3 but it is increased along granule cell den - drites [ 157 ] ; inhibitors of GAT1 have been studied and developed for epilepsy control [ 158 ] . The other VIP is this community is TSEN2 , whose gene product is a tRNA splicing endonucle - ase complex subunit whose mutations are associated with seizures and pontocerebellar hypo - plasia [ 159 ] . The hub is RMND5B ( aliase GID2 ) , a gene that encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the catabolic - induced degradation of gluconeogenic enzymes [ 160 ] . Gluconeogene - sis occurs in astrocytes and is pro - epileptic [ 161 ] . Community C concentrates most of the VIPs and high - hubs in L - CO network . In this com - munity all the VIPs with known biological functions are associated to seizure activity / severity , or with vulnerability to epilepsy . S100B is a well - known MTLE marker , which codes for an as - trocyte - derived cytokine that promotes neurite outgrowth and increases the levels of intracellu - lar calcium in hippocampal neurons [ 155 , 162 ] . S100B coded protein is a marker of astroglial activation : its hippocampal levels were found to be higher at the side of seizure onset in patients with refractory MTLE [ 163 ] and its plasma concentration was reported to be elevated in MTLE patients [ 164 ] . BMPR2 encodes the bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) receptor 2 , involved in astrocyte development and survival and differentiation of GABAergic and dopaminergic neu - rons [ 165 ] . BMPR2 was found to be strongly expressed in the hippocampal formation of human and rat adult brain [ 166 , 167 ] and it is upregulated in rat adult hippocampus during neuroplasticity or repair upon brain injury [ 168 ] . MBNL1 codes for a regulatory splicing factor involved in the splicing of the microtubule - associated protein tau [ 169 ] . Elevated brain tau lev - els are associated with seizure severity [ 170 ] . MAMBA encodes a member of the glycosyl Transcriptional Modules in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0128174 May 26 , 2015 20 / 37 hydrolase 2 family . The encoded protein localizes to the lysosome where it is the final exoglyco - sidase in the pathway for N - linked glycoprotein oligosaccharide catabolism . Mutations in this gene cause beta - mannosidosis , including severe forms with neonatal onset epilepsy [ 171 ] . RSC1A1 gene product regulates the neuronal expression of the Na + - D - glucose cotransporter SGLT1 , which is increased in the hippocampus during epileptic seizures [ 172 ] . FGF7 codes for the fibroblast growth factor 7 ( FGF7 ) , which is essential for inhibitory synapse formation in the hippocampus . Mice with deficiency in this gene display mossy fiber sprouting and increased neurogenesis , becoming vulnerable to epilepsy [ 173 ] . The high - hubs in community C are either involved in mechanisms related to epilepsy path - ogenesis ( DFF40 and PTPRZ1 ) or in the control of gene expression and translation initiation ( LARP4 , EIF1 ) . PTPRZ1 encodes a member of the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase family whose concentration is increased in the hippocampus of MTLE patients [ 174 ] . This receptor is involved damaged - induced gliosis and neuronal reorganization in the hippocampus of MTLE patients [ 174 ] . DFFB ( aliase DFF40 ) codes for a caspase - activated deoxyribonuclease ( CAD ) / DNA fragmentation factor 40 ( DFF40 ) involved in the triggering of DNA fragmentation , an early event in apoptotic neuronal cell death after brain injury [ 175 , 176 ] . LARP4 gene product , the La - related protein 4 , interacts with poly ( A ) - binding protein and promotes mRNA homeo - stasis [ 177 ] . EIF1 codes for the eukaryotic initiation factor 1 , which integrates the scanning mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation [ 178 ] Community D has only two hubs : G3BP2 , which codes for a Ras - GTPase activating protein that contributes to stress granule formation following cellular stress [ 179 , 180 ] and has its ex - pression levels altered in TLE [ 181 ] and FTSJ1 , whose gene product is a RNA methyltransferase expressed in the hippocampus and associated to intellectual disabilities and seizures [ 182 ] The remaining communities containing high hierarchy genes in L - CO network are : B , which has the second largest number of nodes but harbors just one hub , MLXIP ( aliase Mon - doA ) , which codes for a glucose sensing transcription factor involved in glucose homeostasis [ 183 ] ; and G , containing two high - hubs , TTL that encodes a tubulin - tyrosine - ligase with a vital role in neuronal organization and control of neurite extensions [ 184 ] , and PPFIBP1 whose gene product is a liprin - family scaffold protein regulating cell adhesion , cell migration and syn - apse development [ 185 ] . The general picture of L - CO network is rather different of that depicted in E - CO , where the genes related to compensatory pathways predominated in the communities with strongest weight connections . Here the communities with the most relevant relationships harbor several genes related to pro - epileptic effects , seizure related mechanisms and vulnerability to epilepsy ( SLC6A1 , S100B , RSCA1 and PTPRZ1 ) , and just a few ones acting on compensatory mechanisms ( BMPR2 ) or homeostasis ( MLXIP ) . These different scenarios for CO networks will be discussed latter , considering the late and early onset forms of MTLE with a history of febrile seizures . In both E - and L - CO networks the community with the largest number of nodes , i . e . com - munity A ( Fig 6C and 6D ) , was devoid of high - hierarchy genes , with most of their nodes well below of the k 0 and k 1 cut - off values ( Fig 2B and 2D ) adopted for these networks . Interactome network analysis An interactome analysis was performed in order to validate GCN results . Only the high hierar - chy genes ( hubs , VIPs or high - hubs ) were considered in this analysis . MINT and IntAct data - bases were selected for data generation , which resulted in interactomes with 106 nodes and 222 edges for the E - DE group and 187 nodes and 690 edges for L - DE ( Fig 7A and 7B ) ; 161 nodes and 318 edges for E - CO and 215 nodes and 454 edges for L - CO ( Fig 8A and 8B ) .

A functional description of the interactome nodes for all DE and CO networks based on Gene Ontology ( bi - ological process ) and PubMed databases is presented in S1 , S2 , S3 and S4 Tables . Discussion Community detection analysis of modular transcriptional repertoires for DE and CO gene coexpression networks , and the subsequent CGCS data analysis , revealed distinct molecular pathways for early - and late - onset forms of MTLE associated with childhood febrile seizures , as discussed below . Moreover , network connectivity is lower in both E networks when com - pared to the corresponding L networks , thus indicating that the hippocampal CA3 region of patients with early - onset FS - MTLE present a higher degree of dysregulation in cells ’ functional organization [ 29 , 32 , 43 ] . Interactome analysis for experimentally verified protein - protein in - teractions confirmed the relevance of most high - hierarchy genes in E and L networks . In the E - DE network coarse - grained community structure shows communities C and I as the ones with strongest connection weights . This C - I “ axis ” , described earlier in this paper , har - bors high hierarchy genes with relevant roles in febrile - driven epilepsy and MTLE , such as SCN9A , RTN2 and BAIAP2 , in community C , and B3GALTN1 , KCN3 and MTA1 in communi - ty I . This synaptic excitability “ axis ” is seconded by the axis A - B , whose high hierarchy genes are also related to pro - epileptic roles , as SYN2 and NIDD ( ZDHHC23 ) . All this gene set is di - rectly or indirectly involved with the molecular hallmarks of febrile seizures and epilepsy , namely : calcium and potassium channels , glutamate , NMDA receptors , HCN channels and HDACs [ 13 ] . Therefore on can conclude that E - DE network may well represent the “ ground zero ” of FS impact in hippocampal CA3 . The E - CO network , adopting the former analogy , would depict the derived “ shock - waves ” of FS impact on hippocampal CA3 cells . Indeed , the E - CO community with the strongest con - nection weights is community C , followed by communities D and H . The majority of the genes in the C - D - H interconnected communities are related to compensatory effects in epilepsy ( sei - zure inhibition , neuronal survival and stress responses ) , what is in accordance with the concept that early onset epilepsies , although impacting more severely the ictal hippocampus , are associ - ated to compensatory mechanisms [ 8 ] . Interestingly , this concept emerged from fMRI studies using network ( graph theory ) computational studies for assessing brain connectivity [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] . Hence , we can conclude that FS and FSE cause a perturbation in genomic and brain networks , determining “ adaptive ” rearrangements in both . The disease can be viewed as the breakdown of functional modules causing network reorganization . This issue will be further addressed below . The L - DE network represents the “ ground zero ” of late - onset FS - MTLE , i . e . , the GCN in - ferred from differentially expressed genes in the CA3 region of a hippocampus damaged by fe - brile IPI in early childhood but where temporal lobe epilepsy onset occurred after a long latent period ( see Table 1 ) . Here community C centers the strongest connection weights and also har - bors most of the network ’ s VIPs and high hubs , what indicates its importance for network sta - bility and functionality . The connection between C and F communities ( Fig 6B ) is the equivalent of the E - DE synaptic excitability C - I “ axis ” . Accordingly , the C - F “ axis ’ also harbors genetic and molecular hallmarks of epilepsy , such as : i ) in community C the L - type calcium channel gene CACNA1 , RTN2 , a regulator of EAAC1 ( also a VIP in E - DE network ) , the calci - um binding / signaling genes TESC , CALM3 , EFHD2 ; ii ) in community F the gene CTNAP1 , Transcriptional Modules in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0128174 May 26 , 2015 24 / 37 regulator of the glutamate receptor subunit GluA1 . Moreover , as described before , other signif - icant connections of community C — the communities A , H , and B — include several genes in - volved in epilepsy processes , like SXN25 and ARPC5L , markers of intractable epilepsy . Since L - DE high hierarchy genes , as a whole , are involved neuronal excitability or playing roles in other epilepsy - related processes , this network is functionally similar to E - DE . However , it re - flects distinctive adaptive response to febrile seizures , probably related to late - onset MTLE development . Contrarily to the observed for E - CO network , L - CO communities with strongest weighted connections harbor more high hierarchy genes related to pro - epileptic effects , or vulnerability to epilepsy , than to compensatory mechanisms . This finding , fully described in the Results sec - tion , is in accordance to the concept that early - onset epilepsies are associated with compensato - ry mechanisms , because the younger brain is more plastic , whereas in late - onset developed epilepsies the mature injured brain is less able to generate adaptive compensatory mechanisms [ 8 , 186 ] . Imaging studies ( structural and functional MRI ) and graph theory models of brain connec - tivity led to significant progress in understanding the pathophysiology of temporal lobe epilep - sy , [ 6 , 8 , 187 ] . Essentially , these studies showed that TLE is a network disease , i . e . a system disorder that alters local and distributed brain networks [ 6 , 188 ] . Similarly to the application of complex network analysis to the study of gene - gene and protein - protein interactions , graph theory modeling of brain networks allows a quantitative description of the topological organi - zation of brain connectivity based on network property measures , where nodes represent brain regions interconnected by edges . In this context , communities , or modules , are groups of high - ly connected nodes within the brain networks , modularity describes hierarchical organization , and network hubs are the nodes with greater degree centrality , i . e . , those mediating most of the short path lengths between nodes . According to their community insertion and connectivity profile , hubs mediate intra - or inter module connectivity [ 6 , 26 , 188 ] . Complex network analyses of human brain connectivity revealed that the hippocampal for - mation has a concentration of densely linked nodes with very high degree centrality [ 189 ] . In - creased clustering , an indicator of low connectivity , and alterations in the distribution of network hubs were detected in patients with refractory MTLE comparatively to normal con - trols [ 190 ] . Moreover , it was found , by comparing brain connectivity parameters of early - and late - onset MTLE patients who underwent resting - state fMRI scan , that late - onset patients had lower connectivity and higher modularity [ 8 ] , thus indicating a certain degree of modular in - teraction disorganization in late - onset cases . These MRI data have a striking similarity with our findings on community structure analysis of transcriptional networks in early - and late - onset MTLE : i ) comparative alterations in modularity / connectivity and hub and modular dis - tributions ; ii ) evidences that in late MTLE development the brain is less able to generate adaptive mechanisms . Altogether , gene coexpression and MRI networks studies on MTLE show that this disease , as other chronic non - communicable diseases , stems from environmentally - induced perturba - tions of complex intra and intercellular networks , probably modulated by the individual ’ s ge - nomic makeup . Network reorganization following these perturbations may be kept stable for long periods due to epigenetic mechanisms acting just after the insult , and / or just after epilepsy onset [ 18 , 19 ] . In fact , it was shown in kainic acid mouse model of epilepsy that genome - wide methylation status change after status epilepticus and in epileptic tolerance [ 191 ] , thus contrib - uting to regulate gene expression ( and to reorganize gene - gene interaction networks ) in the sei - zure - damaged hippocampus . The complex network analyses performed in this study allowed a broad and more detailed view of genomic and molecular mechanisms involved in early and late - onset MTLE , in Transcriptional Modules in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0128174 May 26 , 2015 25 / 37 comparison to analyses centered solely on differentially expressed genes . Network centrality in DE and CO networks , is consistent with the network disease model , where a group of nodes whose perturbation ( e . g . febrile IPI ) leads to a disease phenotype occupies a central position in the network [ 4 , 28 , 192 ] . Most importantly , our data on hippocampal CA3 gene coexpression networks are in agree - ment with previous fMRI data showing that early onset epilepsies , although impacting more se - verely the ictal hippocampus , are associated to compensatory mechanisms , while in late MTLE development the brain is less able to generate adaptive mechanisms . This is very significant if one considers that the identification of windows of opportunity for antiepileptogenic interven - tions depends on a better understanding of the mechanisms occurring during the seizure - free interval , or latent period , in MTLE [ 23 ] . On the other hand , the probability of exerting thera - peutic effects through the modulation of particular genes will be higher if these genes are highly interconnected in transcriptional networks [ 4 , 2 , 193 ] . In epilepsy — a disease affecting more than 50 million people around the world and where 30 % of the patients do not respond to the available antiepileptic drugs — this systems biology approach seems to be mandatory for discov - ering new multi - target drugs , since hitting a single target does not treat complex diseases . In conclusion , a network - based approach to intractable epilepsy would be probably more effective than the “ silver bullets ” sought at the beginning of medical genomics .
