Ecologically Driven Competence for Exogenous DNA Uptake in Yeast Petar Tomev Mitrikeski 1 , 2 Received : 15 August 2014 / Accepted : 20 February 2015 / Published online : 1 April 2015 (cid:2) Springer Science + Business Media New York 2015 Abstract Unlike prokaryotes , eukaryotic organisms do not seem to be equipped with natural cell process ( es ) designated for exogenous DNA uptake . However , it is barely known that under laboratory circumstances re - sembling wild fungal environment ( s ) , at least some lower eukaryotes could become naturally competent for ex - ogenous DNA uptake . Thus , apart from the known fact that non - manipulated cells of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae take exogenous DNA by conjugation with certain bacteria , there are also mechanical and physio - logical mechanisms enabling their transformation under environmental conditions . This clearly shows that lower eukaryotes are amenable to transformation without ap - plying man - made technology ( i . e . , naturally ) . However , this topic failed to raise critical scientiﬁc interest . Therefore , this review aims to scrutinize the overall im - plication of the phenomenon stressing its fundamental and applicable importance . It also summarizes all ax - iomatic laboratory circumstances / vehicles hitherto known to provoke yeast competence naturally and critically discusses plausible mechanisms behind . Possi - ble pathways underlying the phenomenon are emphasized and a unifying model is proposed . This story potentially spans several different research ﬁelds , from evolutionary genetics to genetic transformation technology . Introduction Introduction of genetic material into a cell resulting in a heritable change leads to genetic transformation . In order to take up exogenous DNA , the cell must be rendered competent which can be achieved either artiﬁcially or naturally . Natural competence in prokaryotes is largely spread . More than 40 species from all prokaryotic taxa are reported naturally transformable [ 47 ] and based on the whole genome analysis many more are suspected [ 14 ] . General machinery for DNA uptake is similar between Gram - positive and Gram - negative bacteria being related to Type II secretion systems and Type IV pili [ 13 , 14 , 17 ] . In order to internalize foreign DNA , transformable prokary - otes relay on the action of competence - speciﬁc genes . Several of these from both bacterial groups have been identiﬁed and characterized allowing better understanding of the whole phenomenon . In Gram - negative bacteria ( e . g . , Neisseria gonorrhoeae ) , exogenous double - stranded ( ds ) DNA attaches to the bacterial surface and crosses the outer membrane through a channel formed by PilQ [ 13 , 14 ] . Such DNA still needs to pass the periplasm , the peptido - glycan layer , and the inner ( cytoplasmic ) membrane in order to enter the cytoplasm . This is achieved by pilin complex made of PilE and also helped by DNA - binding protein , ComE [ 13 , 14 ] . ComE controls the ﬁnal DNA delivery to the cytoplasm that is made possible through the channel crossing the membrane formed by ComA [ 13 ] . During this ﬁnal internalization , only one DNA strand This article is dedicated to my late father who fostered my love for natural sciences . & Petar Tomev Mitrikeski pmitrik @ irb . hr 1 Present Address : Laboratory for Evolutionary Genetics , Division of Molecular Biology , Rud ¯ er Bos ˇ kovic ´ Institute , Bijenicˇka cesta 54 , 10000 Zagreb , Croatia 2 Institute for Research and Development of Sustainable Ecosystems , FSB - CTT , Ivana Lucˇic´a 5 , 10000 Zagreb , Croatia 123 Curr Microbiol ( 2015 ) 70 : 883 – 893 DOI 10 . 1007 / s00284 - 015 - 0808 - 8 enters the cytosol because its complementary counterpart is being simultaneously degraded . On the other hand , Gram - positive bacteria bear no outer membrane and , therefore , the whole process is slightly different there . In Bacillus subtilis , incoming foreign DNA requires ComGC to access the DNA - binding protein ComEA [ 13 , 14 ] ; such DNA is degraded to single - stranded ( ss ) form by a nuclease ( un - known in B . subtilis but EndA in Streptococcus pneumo - niae ) and pushed into the cytosol by the aid of DNA translocase ComFA ( unknown in Gram - negative bacteria ) using the trans - membrane channel formed by ComEC [ 13 ] . Taken together , all this clearly shows that both trans - formable groups of bacteria have evolved elaborated sys - tems for attaching exogenous dsDNA to their surfaces and subsequent cytosol internalization of its ss form in order to get transformed . However , in eukaryotes there is no ana - logous genetic program permitting natural transformation . Thus until recently , the prevailing view has been that the eukaryotic cell does not take exogenous DNA naturally . Nevertheless , two interesting reports have shown that non - manipulated cells of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are naturally transformable under laboratory conditions [ 25 , 56 ] . Moreover , non - artiﬁcial yeast transformation in the laboratory can be also caused by mechanical damage [ 15 ] or direct cell - to - cell contact by living mediators ( donor bacterial cell ) [ 9 , 27 , 29 , 59 , 65 , 71 , 75 ] . These ex - perimental conditions resemble ecological circumstances relevant in natural fungal habitats and are provoking to assume that yeast cells can become naturally competent for exogenous DNA uptake . All examples of eukaryotic competence under ecological scenario here are referred to as Ecologically Driven Eukaryotic Competence ( EDEC ) in order to distinguish this phenomenon from purely artiﬁcial yeast competence ( Technologically Driven Eukaryotic Competence—TDEC ) . Still , such eukaryotic competence seems to be not just largely neglected but also unnoticed phenomenon by the majority of researchers that are understandably more inter - ested in ever better transformation procedures and faster protocols . It is merely a coincidence that the ﬁrst report on eukaryotic transformability [ 61 ] became a subject of dispute itself [ 24 , 62 ] . However , that postponed the development of the ﬁeld for almost two decades [ 28 , 40 ] . Therefore , the main goal of this review is to scrutinize the overall implication of EDEC presenting the phenomenon as a separate paradigm worth scientiﬁc efforts . On the other hand , the capability of yeast to take up exogenous DNA naturally raises questions about the plausible environmental conditions and / or vehi - cles leading to EDEC and renders the underlying mechanism ( s ) fundamentally important . Since S . cerevisiae is of paramount signiﬁcance in both basic and applied ge - netic research , deeper understanding of the phenomenon is necessary . Therefore , this review also aims to summarize the contemporary knowledge on all axiomatic laboratory cir - cumstances / vehicles—resembling fungal ecological envi - ronment ( s ) —that are known to provoke yeast competence naturally . The knowledge presented here may launch addi - tional interest about the role of horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) in eukaryotic evolution and the ecology of microbial biocenoses . First of a kind , this story could be useful to researchers from different ﬁelds , from evolutionary genetics to genetic transformation technology . Why is there Ecologically Driven Eukaryotic Competence ? In prokaryotes , the ability to acquire foreign DNA naturally may have evolved as a substitute for sexual reproduction ( i . e . , parasexuality ) since it might contribute in maintaining genetic variability [ 16 , 42 , 50 ] . On the other side , although it seems that EDEC is a relevant eukaryotic phenomenon , its main implication is not entirely clear . Yeast transformability was earlier reported being a quantitative trait [ 34 ] suggesting that EDEC may have been evolutionary preserved in eukaryotes . This implies that EDEC contributes to better adaptability over evolutionary time . However , this is a puzzling notion . Being eukaryote , yeast has predominantly diplontic life style with vertical gene transfer and , therefore , its ability to evolve is expected to rely on meiosis and sub - sequent random gamete fusion . So , the question is whether EDEC really matters ? To try answering this question , we need to consider the signiﬁcance of the yeast life cycle in more detail . Although yeast is able to reproduce sexually , it is known that asexual proliferation is its dominant mode of reproduction in the wild [ 69 , 83 ] . For instance , sexual re - production in S . paradoxus appears only once per 1 , 000 asexual generations [ 83 ] . In such population , heritable in - novation coming through HGT ( e . g . , EDEC ) can imaginably increase biodiversity and consequently shape the future of the species through adaptive evolution . This scenario seems sufﬁciently corroborated by numerous reported cases of HGT in yeast . Particularly , horizontally acquired foreign genes had led to novel functions in yeast such as the ability to synthesize biotin , utilize sulphate , and even grow under anaerobic conditions [ 23 ] . Processes as important as wine fermentation , cellular transport , and stress responses were also shaped by the help of new genes taken horizontally [ 10 , 60 ] . It is also known that some yeast selﬁsh genomic ele - ments are evolutionarily adapted to spread horizontally [ 43 ] . All this , indeed , strongly suggests that EDEC might have importantly contributed to fungal evolution [ 19 ] and this possibility is amazingly plausible even in Metazoans such as sexless bdelloid rotifers [ 74 ] and even in plants [ 77 ] . This general consideration perhaps sheds light to an - other important dilemma coming from prokaryotic realm . 884 P . T . Mitrikeski : Ecologically Driven Competence for Exogenous DNA Uptake in Yeast 123 Namely , it has been long speculated why is there abundant natural transformability among bacteria . There are three hitherto plausible possibilities that are not mutually ex - clusive [ 13 , 17 ] and also applicable to eukaryotes : ( i ) ac - quisition of novel genetic information , ( ii ) exploitation of undamaged foreign genetic material that could be used for DNA repair among its own or amid closely related species , and ( iii ) gathering food ( DNA is a valuable source of carbon , nitrogen and phosphorous ) . EDEC supports the ﬁrst hypotheses , it stays ambivalent ( but is more supportive than not ) on the second one and it does not seem to support the third one . The ﬁrst hypothesis is particularly cor - roborated by the fact that the majority of known novel fungal traits acquired by HGT have mainly come from non - related species [ 10 , 19 , 60 ] . The second hypothesis be - comes attractive if we remember that broken yeast DNA is predominantly repaired by homologous recombination ( HR ) ( double - strand break repair ) [ 46 ] . Thus all exogenous hereditary material coming from closely related species horizontally can be potentially used for endogenous DNA repair by HR without compromising genomic integrity . Indeed , this scenario would be entirely imaginable if yeast was a haploid organism . However , yeast may exist in haploid , diploid , or polyploid form . It is known that laboratory strains exhibit strong drive toward diploidiza - tion after only a few rounds of haploid clonal reproduction [ 41 ] ( this is considered to be a general feature of their genomes ) . On the other hand , no overall bias toward su - perior performance of diploids within a large fraction of yeast genotypic space was uncovered and , moreover , in many examined environments haploids revealed better mitotic proliferation rendering the general tendency toward diploidization questionable [ 88 ] . So , an alternative expla - nation that diploidization is not a universal feature of wild yeast was considered [ 88 ] . If that so , the second hypothesis might also be seen as a plausible explanation for EDEC . Finally , the third hypothesis seems to be disputed by the fact that in prokaryotes acquired exogenous DNA is half vested by being degraded to ss form [ 33 ] . Therefore , its utilization must be different from nutritional or at least it has an additional purpose . However , EDEC supports ac - quisition of dsDNA . But since EDEC is expected to be more circumstantial rather that switch - on / off trait nutri - tional hypothesis does not look plausible in eukaryotes either . Laboratory Conditions / Vehicles Enabling Yeast to Take Exogenous DNA Naturally Both biological mediation and environmental induction resembling natural fungal habitat ( s ) are known to change the yeast cell in order to become competent for exogenous DNA uptake under laboratory conditions . Thus , yeast might be naturally transformed through conjugation me - diated by bacteria [ 9 , 27 , 29 , 59 , 65 , 71 , 75 ] or utilizing environmental induction , both mechanical [ 15 ] and physiological [ 56 ] . Yeast Competence Mediated by Living DNA - Donors Transfer of a selectable vector ( i . e . , plasmid ) between yeast strains of opposite sex during mating is perhaps the simplest form of EDEC ( so called stepwise transformation by cyto - duction ; [ 79 ] ) . However , more elaborated and techno - logically reliable route is the possibility to transfer DNA via direct cell - to - cell contact mediated by another species , usually bacterial . So yeast can be transformed via conjuga - tion by Escherichia coli [ 27 , 59 ] or Agrobacterium tume - faciens [ 65 ] ( Table 1 ) . This is called trans - kingdom genetic exchange and requires viable donor cell , the presence of a speciﬁc plasmid within the donor cell , and ssDNA transfer . Freshly grown bacteria ( donor ) and yeast ( recipient ) cells suspended in TNB buffer are simply mixed [ 27 ] or spread on ﬁlter membrane disks [ 59 ] in donor : recipient ratio of 1 : 10 followed by plating on appropriate medium in order to achieve genetic exchange between E . coli and S . cerevisiae . Utilizing this approach , researchers have shuf - ﬂed and / or targeted alleles in yeast [ 58 , 72 ] and transferred YACs to yeast [ 53 ] generally leading to transmission fre - quency between 3 9 10 - 8 and 5 9 10 - 5 [ 27 ] or even be - tween 10 - 5 and 10 - 3 per recipient cell [ 59 ] . Such trans - kingdom conjugation was also performed between bacte - rial chromosomeless mini - cells and yeasts [ 21 ] and applied to other fungi [ 26 , 31 ] . The procedure utilized for Agrobacterium - mediated transformation ( AMT ) of yeast also includes co - cultivation of the bacterial donor with the recipient yeast cells on a solid medium containing inducing agents for the Agrobacterium virulence genes [ 9 , 29 , 65 , 71 ] . However , the most successful protocol requires not 1 : 10 as with E . coli but 1 : 100 donor : recipient ratio [ 29 ] . Using such approaches , transmission frequencies between 10 - 6 [ 9 ] and even 10 - 3 [ 65 ] for binary vectors and between 10 - 8 and 10 - 6 for biparental mating [ 71 ] were achieved . AMT is usually used for replicative or integrative ( both targeted and random ) transformation in yeast [ 2 , 9 ] and also for in vivo recombineering [ 80 ] . Finally , recently AMT was implemented as a 96 - well - microtiter plate procedure adopted for large - scale transformation [ 75 ] . Here it is worth mentioning that recent advances on direct cell - to - cell eukaryotic transformation point out the possibility to transfer whole genomes from bacteria to yeast [ 4 , 35 ] . The newest protocol is simpliﬁed to include only PEG treatment of the bacteria / yeast mixture without any DNA puriﬁcation [ 35 ] . Thus , it only requires P . T . Mitrikeski : Ecologically Driven Competence for Exogenous DNA Uptake in Yeast 885 123 preparation of bacterial culture , generation of yeast spheroplasts , and subsequent plating on appropriate yeast medium . It was suggested that transformation happens by cell fusion , engulfment , or massive uptake of released bacterial genomes [ 35 ] . This would likely resemble an ecological scenario if the used yeast cells were intact . However , although not entirely impossible , the existence of yeast spheroplasts freely dwelling in a natural fungal habitat is very unlikely . Environmentally Induced Yeast Competence Utilizing either mechanical or physiological induction yeast could be rendered competent under laboratory conditions resembling relevant ecological circumstances ( Table 1 ) . Thus , mixture of yeast cells and vector DNA vortexed with sterile glass beads in osmotically supportive medium could yield between 20 and 1 , 000 t / l g DNA if immediately plated on appropriate selection medium [ 15 ] . The authors also suggested that similar mechanically induced competence may happen under ecological conditions . Activation of the physiological route was ﬁrstly reported by Nevoigt et al . [ 56 ] when yeast cells metabolizing monosaccharides / disaccharides were seen to take episomal plasmid DNA leading to efﬁciency of only 1 - 10 t / l g DNA . Such transformability was completely abolished in rich or minimal media indicating that the competence was indeed physiologically actuated . Another approach that might be regarded as physiological induction of EDEC is the so - called yeast transfection [ 54 ] . In this approach , intact yeast cells were soaked in distilled water after which were incubated with exogenous DNA in an osmotically supportive medium ( 34 % sucrose ) and subsequently shifted to a hypotonic medium leading to transfection rate between 0 . 5 9 10 - 7 and 0 . 1 9 10 - 7 . Although utilization of chloroquine sig - niﬁcantly enhanced the efﬁciency ( 14 . 9 9 10 - 7 ) , transfec - tion was clearly seen without the use of an enhancer . Therefore , since this approach is indeed based on the natural physiological competence route reported by Nevoigt et al . , it can be also treated as a case of EDEC due to utilization of non - manipulated cells sustained in a disaccharide . However , the oldest research reporting plausible physiological induc - tion of yeast competence should be considered the disputed results by Oppenoorth [ 61 ] . In this research yeast cells growing in a sugar - containing medium during brewing were shown to be able to take up exogenous DNA added thereto . Reviewing the literature , there are miscellaneous cases of yeast competence achieved under circumstances rele - vant for natural fungal habitats ( Table 1 ) . One interesting report on PEG - dependent transformation of otherwise non - manipulated intact yeast cells was also foreseen as a natural transformation strongly correlated with the growth phase [ 25 ] . Such competence can be induced / enhanced me - chanically since it may involve concomitant cell wall damage due to heat shock [ 12 , 25 , 76 ] or pH shift [ 25 ] . Both mechanical damage and heat shock seem relevant environmental conditions , and pH shift is already known to be important in yeast transfection [ 54 ] . Accordingly , the earlier reports of cation - and / or cation / heat shock - aided transformation in yeast [ 7 , 40 ] may also represent cases Table 1 Types and circumstances of ecologically driven competence for exogenous DNA uptake in S . cerevisiae Type / Circumstances Vehicle Efﬁciency / Frequency References Biologically mediated Escherichia coli Direct cell - to - cell contact 10 - 3 [ 27 , 59 ] Agrobacterium tumefaciens Direct cell - to - cell contact 10 - 3 [ 9 , 29 , 65 , 71 , 75 ] Environmentally induced Physiological Sugar metabolism 1 – 10 [ 56 ] Mechanical Physical cell wall damage 10 3 [ 15 ] Ambiguous Natural competence - based transfection in yeast Shift from hypertonic to hypotonic medium / Possibly sugar metabolism [ 10 - 7 [ 54 ] PEG - only Unknown [ 10 2 [ 25 ] PEG / heat shock Unknown [ 10 3 [ 12 , 25 , 76 ] PEG / pH shift Unknown [ 10 3 [ 25 ] Cations - only Unknown Ambiguous [ 40 ] Cations / heat shock Unknown * 10 4 [ 7 ] a a DNA solution used for transformation was Ca 2 ? - rich suspension of bacterial cells treated with lysozyme ; EG : polyethylene glycol ; ss : single stranded .

Mitrikeski : Ecologically Driven Competence for Exogenous DNA Uptake in Yeast 123 relevant for EDEC since they are probable to happen in nature . However , among all these pro - competence factors , PEG is the only one that is purely technological vehicle important for transformation ( although ambiguous the rest are environmentally relevant ) . PEG is used in almost all approaches of artiﬁcial competence due to its indispensable role in DNA adherence [ 8 , 63 , 87 ] . Proper DNA attachment to the cell surface seems ubiquitous in overall competence ( except biolistic and mediated ) since DNA in solution cannot enter the cell unless adhered to its surface ﬁrst [ 64 ] . This shows that if properly attached to the surface , the exogenous DNA needs little or no other outer factor ( s ) to transform the yeast cell since competence is possible solely by PEG [ 25 ] . On the other hand , competence can be achieved also without PEG [ 7 , 40 , 54 , 56 ] suggesting the existence of other pro - adherence means important for transformation . What are those under environmental con - ditions is unknown . Altogether , this implies that all mis - cellaneous PEG - dependant competences can be used as a good model of EDEC simulated in the laboratory , wherein PEG is at least mimicking the unknown natural aid / cir - cumstance needed for proper DNA attachment . Mechanisms , Routes , and Pathways of EDEC Both artiﬁcially and naturally taken exogenous DNA must pass through at least four natural obstacles in order to successfully transform the eukaryotic cell : ( i ) the cell wall , ( ii ) the cell membrane , ( iii ) the cell cytoplasm , and ( iv ) the nuclear envelope . Here I will discuss all plausible mechanisms contemplated to lead to EDEC in yeast . For general discussion on mechanisms of overall eukaryotic transformation , see [ 36 , 38 , 51 , 52 ] . The cell wall is the most difﬁcult barrier to DNA uptake and , thus during TDEC , is removed , technologically al - tered , or physically bridged in order to allow the internal - ization of the genetic material . On the other hand , EDEC in yeast should be expected to happen in intact cells having a functional cell wall . However , in order to accept the ex - ogenous DNA these cells must transiently tolerate minor or moderate alteration ( s ) in the structure of the wall possibly changing its adherence ability and / or permeability . Such alterations can inﬂuence both physical and chemical properties of the wall . Physical alterations are not only plausible during mediated competence but are also ex - pected in environmentally induced competence . In the ﬁrst case , the hollow pilus simply physically penetrates the cell wall and preexisting structural alterations seem unneces - sary although cannot be excluded ( Fig . 1 ; physical route ) . For instance , it is known that histone deacetylation affects mediated competence [ 75 ] raising the possibility that there are genes involved in cell wall alteration leading to EDEC . In the second case , when the competence is mechanically enhanced , the cell wall might become transiently penetra - ble due to preexistence of environmentally induced minor cracks in it ( Fig . 1 ; mechanical route ) . On the other hand , chemical alterations of the cell wall during yeast compe - tence under natural circumstances are plausible but , how - ever , very difﬁcult to abstract partially because they might initiate physical change ( s ) leaving the difference between those fussy . Nevertheless , one obvious ground for differ - entiating between physical and chemical alterations of the wall during competence is their cause . For instance , plau - sible chemical changes are supposed to be physiologically driven during environmentally induced competence . Therefore , cell wall properties are altered [ 36 , 82 ] perhaps as an outcome of an elevated level of cAMP due to monosacharides / disaccharides metabolism [ 85 ] ( Fig . 1 ; physiological route ) . This mechanism might be utilized also during the so - called yeast transfection [ 54 ] although there additional inﬂuence on the cell wall structure might be enforced by the hypo - to hypertonic shift . Finally , due to heat shock or pH shift , both physical and chemical alter - ations of the wall seem also probable during either PEG - or cation - dependant ambiguous EDEC [ 25 ] . Here it is necessary to emphasize the cAMP hypothesis in more detail . The importance of cAMP level in overall eukaryotic competence was ﬁrst foreseen and contemplated by Murata’s group [ 36 ] . Owing to utilization of non - or barely manipulated yeast cells , this hypothesis appears important also for EDEC . 1 In wild - type ( wt ) yeast cells growing on glucose , the cAMP level was found to be transiently elevated only in lag phase , started to decrease after the initiation of the log phase and stayed low in sta - tionary phase [ 48 ; but see also 20 , 70 ] . During ambiguous EDEC ( see Table 1 ) , cells became competent during the early log phase reaching the maximum competence be - tween the early log phase and mid - log phase after which the competence disappeared rapidly [ 25 ] . This pattern seems to follow the previously seen decrease of the cAMP level . The role of cAMP level in ambiguous EDEC was also signiﬁcantly corroborated by two independent studies showing that pde2 D strains were high - competence mutants [ 36 , 82 ] ; 2 cells with nonfunctional PDE2 gene are known to have elevated basal cAMP level [ 57 ] . Supporting argu - ments additionally come from the fact that pH shift causes pro - competence effect in ambiguous EDEC [ 25 ] ; it is long known that intracellular acidiﬁcation triggers signiﬁcant increase of the cAMP level [ see 81 ] . Therefore , high cAMP 1 [ 36 ] used protocol described in [ 25 ] ; Hayama et al . described the transforming cells as ‘‘intact and ﬂawless’’ since their general intention was to develop a novel transformation approach relying exactly on minimal or no manipulation . 2 [ 82 ] used protocol described in [ 76 ] —protocols from [ 25 ] and [ 76 ] relay solely on early - to mid - log cells and PEG . P . T . Mitrikeski : Ecologically Driven Competence for Exogenous DNA Uptake in Yeast 887 123 level appears important for ambiguous EDEC where wt yeast cells dwelling in an environment without fermentable sugars , expected to be ‘‘intact and ﬂawless’’ and well below late log or stationary phase become naturally trans - formable . On the other hand , yeast cells using only fer - mentable sugars get transformed during late log or even stationary phase [ 56 ] 3 when the cAMP level is expected to be low . Since sudden inﬂux of fermentable sugars could have triggered a spike in the cAMP level [ 5 ; but also see 81 , 85 ] , allowing competence there , coupling both phe - nomena—cAMP level increase and sugar metabolism—as being relevant for physiologically induced EDEC appeared plausible [ 51 ] . Again , high or transiently increased cAMP level seems important also for induced EDEC ( the most straightforward EDEC ) rendering this contemplation attractive enough to conceive further experimental ad - dressing promising interesting insights generally important for both , EDEC and TDEC . For instance , it would be in - teresting to see whether tpk D strains—known for either increased ( tpk1 D and tpk2 D ) or decreased ( tpk3 D ) com - petence during early log phase [ 36 ] —would exert the same phenotype ( s ) in late log / stationary cells since nonfunc - tional TPK genes lead to impaired glucose accumulation [ 5 ] . The next barrier to exogenous DNA uptake is the cell membrane . Transforming DNA ( tDNA ) that passed the cell wall penetrates the space between the wall and the mem - brane . Such DNA cannot be internalized easily since it is not membrane soluble and additionally bears opposite electrical charge which repels it from the surface of the cell . These problems are not anticipated during mediated transformation since there tDNA should be safely delivered through the pilus [ 44 ] . However , all other cases of EDEC seem to depend on two alternative internalization routes : Fig . 1 Pathways and routes of ecologically driven eukaryotic com - petence simulated in the laboratory ( see text ) . Increased level of cAMP due to sugar metabolism seems critical for environmentally induced competence ( physiological route ) . Ras / cAMP pathway— possibly via cell wall alteration—should also be involved in such transformation . The endocytotic route for overcoming cell membrane during DNA internalization might be dependent on Arp2p / 3p activation machinery [ 36 ] . Action of SIN3 / SPF1 or RCY1 can inﬂuence either initial ( due to enhanced DNA absorbance [ 36 , 64 ] or lack of phosphatidylethanolamine in the membrane [ 6 , 18 ] ) or middle step ( s ) ( endosomic DNA release ; [ 66 ] ) of such competence , respectively . * Equally plausible is ssDNA . ds : double stranded ; ss : single stranded . This drawing is not to scale 3 Yeast cells were grown in rich medium to concentration of 1 9 10 8 cells / ml before being washed and challenged by free DNA in 1 M sucrose at a density of 1 . 5 9 10 9 cells / ml . 888 P . T . Mitrikeski : Ecologically Driven Competence for Exogenous DNA Uptake in Yeast 123 ( i ) endocytosis / endocytosis - like process or ( ii ) transiently increased membrane permeability . The ﬁrst route depends on the ability of the cell to engulf bulk material through membrane invagination resulting in a DNA - loaded endo - some which subsequent internalization enables tDNA to enter the cytosol [ 68 ] ( Fig . 1 ; endocytotic route ) . Several important cell features / processes—such as actin cy - toskeleton organization , endocytotic transport , cytokinesis , and membrane growth and polarity—are expected to syn - ergistically collaborate in forming this route [ 36 , 54 , 66 ] . Such endocytotic route is most obvious in the so - called yeast transfection and therefore also in physiologically induced competence since the former approach is concep - tually based on the later one [ see 54 ] . Nevertheless , one other type of EDEC—based on utilization of PEG / Heat shock [ 36 ] —was also pictured as depending on the endo - cytotic internalization [ 36 , 38 ] . However , while the uti - lization of this route seems entirely adequate in the former cases , its use in PEG - dependant type of natural competence may seem somehow obscure . This ambiguity comes from the fact that the relevant subset of endocytotic mutants reviled no inﬂuence on PEG - dependant competence [ 36 , 38 ] . Should we , therefore , suggest existence of possible non - endocytotic route ( see Fig . 1 ) for tDNA internaliza - tion ? The answer to this question might easily be decisive for artiﬁcial yeast competence where aids other that PEG ( cations , lipid - soluble molecules , and other versatile che - micals ) are frequently used . These are expected to sig - niﬁcantly improve tDNA penetration either by neutralizing the electrical repulse ( divalent cations ; [ 3 , 7 , 22 , 28 , 30 , 39 , 40 , 78 ] ) or by increasing its membrane solubility ( lipid - soluble molecules ; [ 39 , 86 ] ) . However , these chemicals were not used in any known type of straightforward EDEC ( non - ambiguous ; see Table 1 ) accomplished in the laboratory . This shifts the pendulum toward the possibility of existence of only one route for passing the membrane during EDEC although natural molecules equivalent to both types of chemicals are plausible outside the laboratory . Internalized tDNA must survive the degradation activity of the cell while dwelling in the cytosol . The most obvious surviving strategy is used during AMT wherein tDNA enters the cytosol as ss molecule bearing nuclear local - ization sequences ( NLS ) that are both protecting it from degradation and directing it toward the nucleus [ 45 ] . The strategy used when natural competence is mediated by E . coli is not known and also difﬁcult to comprehend . Free tDNA is also expected during non - endocytotic route . However , as was discussed in the earlier section , this route is not so obvious during EDEC simulated in the laboratory . Therefore , it is perhaps more productive to focus on the endocytotic route . Endocytotically internalized tDNA must be released from the endosome before merging with the vacuole in order to escape degradation . The current view is that cell processes responsible for endocytotic / vacuolar pH conditions , autophagy , and ALP sorting pathway are major factors controlling the destiny of the internalized DNA during TDEC [ 66 ] . It was shown that non - wt acidiﬁcation of the endosome slows down the transport of both endo - cytosed DNA to the vacuole [ 66 ] and hydrolases to the endosome / vacuole [ 54 , 66 ] leading to accumulation of undamaged DNA during the so - called yeast transfection . This might easily be important also during environmentally induced eukaryotic competence since signiﬁcant pH alter - ing was reported as pro - competence factor during PEG - dependant approach [ 25 ] . Therefore , we may assume that during EDEC endocytotic route is used at least in PEG - dependant competence . Whether this is also relevant in other types of environmentally induced eukaryotic com - petence yet remains to be seen . Finally , hypotonic shift as an environmental factor seems important during artiﬁcial yeast competence since it contributes to DNA release from the endosomes during the so - called yeast transfection [ 54 , 66 ] . This might be also relevant in natural fungal habitats , but , however , needs further addressing . In order to transform the eukaryotic cell tDNA must ﬁnally enter the nucleus . This phase is most poorly un - derstood even in the artiﬁcial competence approaches . The clearest case is still AMT where existence of NLS in tDNA explains its precise nuclear internalization . However , in all other types of competence ( both EDEC and TDEC ) , we can only speculate about the mechanism ( s ) controlling nuclear internalization . Owing to the lack of NLS , this accounts also for E . coli - mediated competence . Nevertheless , two routes have been earlier abstracted as plausible for nuclear internalization during overall yeast competence . The ﬁrst route is non - active import ( see Fig . 1 ) and might be open during mitosis when nucleus is being remodeled and thus possess more loosen membrane structure [ 32 ] supporting entrance of the endosomically released tDNA or , alterna - tively , endosome – nuclear membrane fusion which delivers the engulfed tDNA directly [ 38 ] . Indeed , the highest arti - ﬁcial transformability was seen at S phase [ 12 ] when en - velope changes enable continuous nuclear expansion [ 32 ] . Cells with prolonged S phase were proven most competent contrary to cells arrested at M - phase [ 11 ] ( no data for G 1 arrested cells ) . This route might be predominantly used in environmental conditions since mediated EDEC , the so - called yeast transfection and all ambiguous approaches [ 7 , 25 , 40 ] indeed showed best transformability with expo - nentially growing cells . However , both types of induced EDEC were accomplished with resting cells suggesting utilization of different route for nuclear internalization . This second route emphasizes the possibility of active nuclear import ( see Fig . 1 ) since isolated yeast nuclei are known to take exogenous DNA in vitro in the presence of P . T . Mitrikeski : Ecologically Driven Competence for Exogenous DNA Uptake in Yeast 889 123 ATP and Mg 2 ? [ 84 ] . It should be , however , kept in mind that suggested classiﬁcation on non - active and active nu - clear internalization route is only speculative and might be easily possible that both routes are used by all types of EDEC or are different aspects of one cumulative route . The relation between the yeast cell cycle and its natural competence promises to open novel avenues of research . Since yeast growth rates are known to affect the duration of the cell cycle [ 67 , 73 ] the competence could be inﬂuenced by the alteration of the length of each or a speciﬁc phase . In rich medium , yeast spends equal time in both G 1 and S phases ( each * 1 / 4 of the total cycle time ) and twice as that in G 2 phase [ 73 ] . However , in media containing ethanol and no sugar , G 1 phase is signiﬁcantly expended mostly on the expense of the S phase [ 67 ] . Therefore , signiﬁcantly shortened S phase might be a reason ( one of ) for low competence in stationary cells ( derepressed cells growing on ethanol ; see [ 81 ] ) . It is also worth noticing that the effect of S phase on competence could be challenged in cells growing under systematic nitrogen limitation where this phase is considerably prolonged . For instance , cells growing on proline experience threefold longer S phase ( along with the whole cycle ) compared to those on am - monia [ 67 ] . Should we then expect 3 9 higher competence there ? Altogether , we can abstract two pathways for tDNA uptake leading to EDEC : ( i ) direct and ( ii ) progressive ( Fig . 1 ) . Contemplating on the progressive pathway , it is impossible to suggest general processivity that would logically group all such types of EDEC into one . Rather , it is more plausible to describe the progressive pathway as an aggregation of discrete interweaving sub - pathways . They most obviously segregate during overcoming the obstacle erected by the cell wall but congregate once the tDNA is cellularly internalized . Therefore , processivity cannot be entirely excluded in the middele / later steps of the pro - gressive pathway , after passing the cell membrane . It may be that there are several ways ( perhaps , some of them unknown yet ) of overcoming the cell wall but only a few to pass the membrane , survive the cytosol , and enter the nu - cleus . If so , after internalization processivity may be indispensable . Genes Important for Ecologically Driven Yeast Competence Two main cell traits / processes may be responsible for EDEC : ( i ) the cell surface characteristics ( genes SPF1 , PDE2 , SRB1 & unknown SRB gene / allele , SIN3 ; [ 36 , 64 , 82 ] ) , and ( ii ) the bulk material internalization and trans - port—cytoskeletal dynamics and / or organization and en - docytosis ( genes GCN5 , NGG1 , YAF9 , EAF7 , HST4 , HDA2 , HDA3 , SHE4 , ARC18 , PDE2 , SPF1 , PMR1 ; [ 36 , 75 ] ) and vesicular transport ( genes VPS21 , VPS45 , VAM6 , YPT7 , YPT51 , STV1 , VPH1 , NHX1 , VPS17 , APL5 , VAC8 , PEP4 ; [ 54 , 66 ] ) . There is additional ambiguous genetic contribution that is classiﬁed here as ( iii ) miscellaneous ( genes GSH1 , LAP4 , TPO2 , YGR071C , YNR061C , YDR119 W , NCE103 , ATG8 , ATX2 , SBE2 , AXL2 , MUB1 , YBR267 W , GIS4 , YER113C , NSR1 ; [ 25 , 37 ] ) . All these genes were attributed to be important in eukaryotic com - petence on the basis of three standardized transformation approaches representing different types of EDEC ( see Table 1 ) : PEG / Heat shock [ 25 , 36 , 63 , 82 ] , the so - called yeast transfection [ 54 , 66 ] , and AMT [ 75 ] . Is There a Difference Between TDEC and EDEC ? The mechanisms ( and genes ) that were discussed here as important for EDEC are also expected in TDEC [ 51 ] necessarily raising concerns about the difference between those . Indeed , is there a difference ? The clearest case of TDEC is the physical transformation . However , while bi - olistic can be seen entirely dependent on man - made tech - nology [ 1 ] , the electroporation seems only partially technologically aided [ 49 ] . There , the technology is needed to push the exogenous DNA across the cell wall , but not even across the cell membrane since natural cellular pro - cesses such as endocytosis may allow its further internal - ization . However , it is plausible to expect that during electroporation , DNA gets pushed simultaneously across both the cell wall and the cell membrane [ 55 ] rendering the cellular internalization entirely artiﬁcial . Nevertheless , while these initial steps in electroporation are techno - logically dependent , later critical phases such as survival into the cytosol and nuclear internalization should not be . This does not apply for biolistic since accelerated DNA is expected to directly penetrate the nucleus . Accordingly , biolistic transformation should be seen as fully artiﬁcial process contrary to electroporation which is only semi - ar - tiﬁcial . This also stands for all other types of TDEC in yeast isolating biolistic as the only transformation approach that is fully independent of natural cellular processes . On the other hand , straightforward cases of EDEC ( mediated and induced ; Table 1 ) clearly show that there are natural ways of cellular internalization ( cell wall : physical , me - chanical , and physiological ; cell membrane : at least en - docytotic ; Fig . 1 ) . Therefore , one might contemplate that the main difference between TDEC and EDEC is the way how the cellular internalization is accomplished . Once ar - tiﬁcially internalized , tDNA , in order to transform the cell , relies on the cellular processes which are likely the same for both types of competence . This necessarily results in a suggestion that all artiﬁcial competences in yeast are at least partially natural . 890 P . T . Mitrikeski : Ecologically Driven Competence for Exogenous DNA Uptake in Yeast 123 Concluding Remarks Traditional belief that eukaryotes are not naturally trans - formable has been confuted by several reports showing that lower eukaryotes are amenable to exogenous DNA uptake under laboratory circumstances mirroring fungal ecology . Indeed , systematic consideration shows that circumstances and vehicles contributing to eukaryotic competence under ecological scenario ( simulated in the laboratory ) are com - prehensive and versatile and here are congruently termed Ecologically Driven Eukaryotic Competence ( EDEC ) . Thus yeast cell can be naturally transformed by exogenous DNA by different type of biological mediation or envi - ronmental induction , the two still poorly understood phe - nomena . However , both the obvious lack of genetically designed mechanism ( s ) ( contrary to prokaryotes ) and the expected circumstantial manifestation of EDEC ( again contrary to prokaryotes ) render its possible role in the bi - ology of lower eukaryotes elusive . Still , recently reported cases of important yeast traits acquired horizontally sub - stantially corroborate its evolutionary signiﬁcance there . Thus EDEC is a phenomenon that cannot be easily dis - carded without serious contemplation . On one side , the overall implication of EDEC seems connected to evolu - tionary forces as important as horizontal gene transfer ; in fact , EDEC suggests that the genomes of lower eukaryotes may have been signiﬁcantly shaped also by processes that are expected to be more relevant for prokaryotes . On the other side , the initial knowledge on the phenomenon is still fragmentary , inconclusive , and incomprehensive . Alto - gether , although EDEC seems to be undoubtedly important phenomenon for the evolution of at least lower eukaryotes , its deeper meaning still resists full scientiﬁc comprehen - sion . Obviously , further systematic and targeted research is needed and necessary . Acknowledgments I wish to thank Dr .
