However , membrane proteins , despite their importance to living organisms , remain relatively unexplored as targets for protein engineering and directed evolution . This gap in capabilities likely results from the tendency of mem - brane proteins to aggregate and fail to overexpress in bacteria cells . For example , the membrane protein ca - veolin - 1 has been implicated in many cell signaling pathways and diseases , yet the full - length protein is too aggregation - prone for detailed mutagenesis , directed evolution , and biophysical characterization . Using a phage - displayed library of full - length caveolin - 1 variants , directed evolution with alternating subtractive and func - tional selections isolated a full - length , soluble variant , termed cav sol , for expression in E . coli . Cav sol folds cor - rectly and binds to its known protein ligands HIV gp41 , the catalytic domain of cAMP - dependent protein kinase A , and the polymerase I and transcript release factor . As expected , cav sol does not bind o ﬀ - target proteins . Cellular studies show that cav sol retains the parent protein ' s ability to localize at the cellular membrane . Unlike truncated versions of caveolin , cav sol forms large , oligomeric complexes consisting of approximately > 50 monomeric units without requiring additional cellular components . Cav sol ' s secondary structure is a mixture of α - helices and β - strands . Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments reveal that cav sol binds to gp41 and PKA with low micromolar binding a ﬃ nity ( K D ) . In addition to the insights into caveolin structure and function , the approach applied here could be generalized to other membrane proteins . 1 . Introduction Approximately 30 % of the human genome encodes membrane proteins ( MPs ) . Essential roles ful ﬁ lled by MPs include ion transporta - tion , energy generation , and signal transduction across the membrane [ 1 ] . Additionally , 60 % of approved therapeutics target MPs , which il - lustrates the importance of MPs in medicine [ 2 ] . The hydrophobicity of transmembrane domains of MPs causes their aggregation upon removal from the membrane ; this precipitation from solution complicates structural and biophysical characterization [ 1 , 3 ] . MPs thus represent only a fraction of the protein structures solved to date [ 4 ] . The ﬁ eld could bene ﬁ t from new approaches to the solubilization and biophy - sical characterization of MPs interacting with their partners , as de - monstrated here . Caveolin - 1 ( cav ) is a highly conserved 22 kDa monotopic MP with both N - and C - termini protruding into the cytoplasm [ 5 , 6 ] . Frequently found in endothelial cells and adipocytes , cav oligomerizes in vivo to force the cell membrane into 50 – 100 nm invaginations , termed ca - veolae [ 6 , 7 ] . At these caveolae - localized hubs , cav binds , inhibits and spatially localizes a number of cell signaling proteins [ 7 , 8 , 9 ] . Cav can also regulate cholesterol homeostasis by tra ﬃ cking cholesterol to the cell membrane [ 6 , 10 , 11 ] . Cav can direct a clathrin - independent route to endocytosis through the caveolae . By this route , cav oligomers coat the caveolae , and cause its lipid membrane to pinch o ﬀ during en - docytosis [ 6 , 11 ] . Small molecules , soluble proteins and cell surface receptors can also enter the cell via caveolae . For example , caveolae endocytose the cholera toxin and the insulin - bound , activated insulin receptor [ 12 , 13 ] . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . bbapap . 2018 . 05 . 014 Received 1 September 2017 ; Received in revised form 16 May 2018 ; Accepted 24 May 2018 ⁎ Corresponding author at : Department of Chemistry , University of California , Irvine , CA 92697 - 2025 , USA .

V . All rights reserved . T In 2004 , Yelick and co - workers demonstrated cav ' s importance to early development . Cav - knockout zebra ﬁ sh embryos had phenotypic de ﬁ ciencies within 12 h post knockout and failed to fully develop [ 14 ] . Phosphorylation of a speci ﬁ c cav residue ( Y14 ) was shown to be a re - quirement for early development . Recent studies have demonstrated that cav knockout mice can survive , but have signi ﬁ cantly reduced lifespans compared to control mice [ 15 ] . In summary , abundant evi - dence demonstrates the essential biological roles played by cav . Despite this importance , cav remains incompletely characterized biophysically and structurally due to its insolubility preventing recombinant over - expression of the full - length protein . Cav is also implicated in a myriad of diseases including diabetes , heart disease , Alzheimer ' s disease , HIV infection , and cancer [ 7 , 11 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 ] . However , the mechanism through which cav con - tributes to these diseases often seems contradictory . For example , cav promotes tumor metastasis in certain cancers , and , in other tumor types , cav suppresses genes promoting cancer development and growth [ 20 , 21 , 22 ] . Furthermore , cav can be either over - or under - expressed in di ﬀ erent tumor types [ 22 , 23 , 24 ] . Additionally , a dominant negative cav mutation , P132L , has been identi ﬁ ed in breast cancer [ 25 , 26 ] . To resolve these issues , a need exists for tools to characterize cav binding and function . The structure of cav dictates its multivariate and complex function . However , structural details of cav have remained elusive . To date , cav secondary structure analysis has applied truncated versions of the protein [ 27 , 28 , 29 ] . For example , the secondary structure of the ca - veolin sca ﬀ olding domain ( CSD , residues 81 – 102 ) was mostly helical ( 63 – 75 % ) based on CD and NMR analysis of peptides representative of this domain ( amino acid residues 81 – 101 and 81 – 109 ) [ 27 , 30 ] . The percentages of helical content varied between these two di ﬀ erent con - structs , suggesting that the length of the peptide could alter secondary structure . Analysis of a longer peptide ( residues 81 – 132 ) revealed that the CSD includes β - strand character , while the IMD retains its helicity [ 28 ] . NMR analysis of a longer truncated cav construct ( residues 62 – 178 ) suggests that the CSD is mostly helical , as are the IMD and C - terminal domains [ 29 ] . Thus , understanding of cav structure evolves with the increasing length of the construct analyzed , which motivated us to develop methods to examine full - length cav . In addition to the length of the peptide examined , the environment surrounding the construct also plays a key role in its secondary struc - ture . For example , the CSD appears α - helical when observed in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine ( DPC ) micelles , which are com - monly used as a generic membrane mimetic [ 27 ] . In contrast , the CSD contains β - strand character in the presence of cholesterol rich lipid bilayers ; the latter environment is designed to more closely resemble the native lipid composition of caveolae [ 28 ] . Thus , previous studies lacking a full - length construct showed that the secondary structure of cav is dependent on both the length of the examined construct and its environment . As a sca ﬀ old or hub protein , cav organizes binding complexes with several di ﬀ erent intracellular binding partners . For example , Polymerase I and Transcript Release Factor ( PTRF or cavin ) [ 31 ] , en - dothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase ( eNOS ) [ 32 ] , adenylyl cyclase [ 33 ] , the catalytic subunit of cAMP - dependent protein kinase A ( PKA ) [ 30 , 34 ] , and the HIV glycoprotein 41 ( gp41 ) [ 35 ] bind , and are enzymatically inhibited by cav . PTRF has been shown to be required for caveolae formation through a direct interaction with cav at the cellular mem - brane [ 31 , 36 ] . Additionally , Nassoy and coworkers show that cells can respond to mechanical stress by quickly disassembling caveolae through disruption of the PTRF - cav interaction , providing extra stretchability for the lipid membrane [ 37 ] . Cav regulates eNOS , ade - nylyl cyclase , and PKA by inhibiting their catalysis [ 32 , 33 , 34 ] . Cav has been shown to inhibit HIV envelope - induced bystander apoptosis of SupT1 cells and CD4 + T lymphocytes through its interaction with gp41 [ 38 ] . We have previously reported that cav binds very weakly to the anti - HIV drug T20 ( trade name Fuzeon ) ; ligands derived from the drug , however , bound with 7500 - fold higher a ﬃ nity [ 39 , 40 ] . T20 was de - rived from the gp41 region thought to bind to cav , and therefore could bind in a similar way . A widely applied protein engineering technique , phage display ge - netically fuses a peptide or protein of interest to a coat protein of the M13 bacteriophage . First described by Smith and coworkers in 1985 [ 41 ] , phage display was initially limited to display of peptides , but has since been extended to the display of several polypeptides , including antibodies [ 42 , 43 ] , protein sca ﬀ olds [ 44 , 45 , 46 ] , and hormones [ 47 ] . Upon successful display of the protein of interest on the phage surface , mutagenesis by either targeted or random substitutions can diversify the phage - encapsulated DNA . Growth in the presence of helper phage can then provide the resultant protein libraries [ 47 ] . Selections can isolate members of the library with a desired trait , such as thermal stability [ 48 ] , solubility [ 36 ] , binding a ﬃ nity , or function [ 44 , 45 ] . Our laboratory has reported a new type of helper phage , termed M13 - KO7 + , which allows the display of MPs , such as cav , on the sur - face of ﬁ lamentous bacteriophage [ 49 , 50 ] . In previous experiments , selections with phage - displayed cav variants identi ﬁ ed cav variants ( e . g . , gen - 1a through gen - 1e ) capable of overexpression as fusion pro - teins in E . coli ; as described above , wild - type ( WT ) cav fails to over - express in E . coli . However , one cav variant from this ﬁ rst generation library ( cav - 11 ) could be overexpressed upon fusion to maltose binding protein ( MBP ) . Subsequent attempts at biophysical and structural characterization were dominated by the large size of MBP ( approx . Two times the MW of cav ) [ 36 ] . Attempts to remove the MBP after proteo - lysis failed consistently . Here , we report a full - length , soluble and functional variant of cav , which does not require fusion to a solubili - zation domain . This variant allows biophysical characterization , in - cluding cav sol ' s secondary structure , oligomerization , and binding to its known binding partners . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Library construction and phage - based selections A phage - displayed library of caveolin - 1 variants was constructed as previously described [ 36 ] with oligonucleotides encoding the sub - stitutions shown in Table 1A . Four rounds of dual subtractive and functional selections were performed as previously described [ 36 ] . 2 . 2 . Subcloning for protein overexpression The gp41 ectodomain ( residues 546 to 578 and 624 to 655 ) and PTRF were subcloned for overexpression as previously described [ 36 ] . The gene for the catalytic domain of PKA ( Addgene ) was subcloned into a pET28c vector using the Nco I and Bam HI restriction sites . The ca - veolin variants isolated after four rounds of selections were ampli ﬁ ed en masse by PCR using primers designed to introduce Bam HI and Eco RI restriction sites at the 5 ′ and 3 ′ termini respectively . This PCR amplicon was then subcloned into the pET28c vector using its BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites . 2 . 3 . Protein overexpression and puri ﬁ cation Protein overexpression was performed in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells . Cells containing DNA encoding either gp41 , PKA , or PTRF were grown from seed cultures ( 10 mL seed / 1 L culture ) to an OD 600 of 0 . 6 ( 37 °C ) . The cells were then induced for protein overexpression by addition of 0 . 5 mM IPTG , and incubated overnight with shaking at 22 °C ( ≈ 12 h ) . The cell pellets for gp41 , PKA , or PTRF were collected , dissolved in lysis bu ﬀ er ( 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 and 300 mM NaCl , pH 8 . 0 , 10 mM 2 - mercap - toethanol ) , and lysed via sonication . The crude cell lysates were in - cubated with IMAC resin ( Ni 2 + - NTA agarose ) for 10 – 12 h at 4 °C . The resin - bound protein was washed with lysis bu ﬀ er supplemented with 20 , 30 , or 40 mM imidazole ( 10 mL each ) . The protein was then eluted J . N . Smith et al . BBA - Proteins and Proteomics 1866 ( 2018 ) 963 – 972 964 with 250 mM imidazole ( 50 mL ) . The eluted gp41 , PKA , or PTRF were then incubated with TEV protease to remove the His 6 tag and analyzed for purity by SDS - PAGE ( 15 % ) . Cells transformed with pET28c vector encoding cav sol were in - cubated at 37 °C until reaching an OD 600 of 0 . 8 , and induced by addi - tion of 0 . 5 mM IPTG for 3 h at 37 °C before collection . The cav sol cell pellets were resuspended in lysis bu ﬀ er A ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , 10 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , pH 8 . 0 ) , and lysed via sonication . The lysate was then centrifuged ( 30 , 996 × g , 45 min ) , and the resulting pellet was washed with wash bu ﬀ er B ( 20 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 20 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 25 % w / v sucrose , pH 7 . 2 ) to further isolate the cav sol present in the inclusion bodies . This solution was centrifuged again ( 30 , 996 x g , 45 min ) , and the resulting pellet was dissolved in denaturing bu ﬀ er ( 8 M urea , 50 mM Tris HCl , 50 mM NaCl , pH 8 . 0 ) at 4 °C overnight with gentle shaking ( ≈ 150 rpm ) . The soluble , denatured protein was in - cubated with Ni 2 + - charged IMAC resin for 10 – 12 h at 4 °C . This ﬂ ow through was collected , and the resin - bound protein was washed with denaturing bu ﬀ er at pH 8 . 0 and pH 5 . 5 ( 20 mL each ) , before elution in denaturing bu ﬀ er at pH 4 . 0 ( 50 mL ) . The eluted protein was dialyzed for four days in refolding bu ﬀ er ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) to yield so - luble , refolded protein . Protein purity was analyzed by 15 % SDS - PAGE ( Fig . S3 ) . The protein was then concentrated and puri ﬁ ed further using size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) as described below . 2 . 4 . ELISAs ELISAs were used to assess protein - protein binding interactions as previously described [ 36 ] . Target proteins were coated on a 96 - well microtiter plate at a concentration of 10 μ g / mL . The plates were blocked with 0 . 2 % nonfat milk ( NFM ) , bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , ovalbumin , or casein , and the indicated concentrations of cav sol in PBS supplemented with 0 . 2 % nonfat milk and 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 were added . A mouse anti - His 6 epitope primary antibody ( Sigma ) and an anti - mouse horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) conjugated secondary antibody ( Sigma ) were added to detect the presence of bound protein . 2 . 5 . Circular dichroism The circular dichroism spectrum of cav sol was obtained using a Jasco J - 810 Spectropolarimeter . Cav sol was dialyzed into PBS and di - luted to 4 μ M for CD analysis at 20 °C . Six continuous wavelength scans from 195 to 255 nm were averaged with a data pitch of 1 nm , a 2 . 0 s response time , a 0 . 1 cm pathlength , and a 5 nm / min scanning speed ( Fig . 3A ) . For the cav sol - DPC CD experiment , a sample of 4 μ M cav sol was examined ( Fig . S5 ) . After this CD scan , 50 mM DPC was added to the same sample , which was again analyzed by CD . Conditions re - mained the same for this experiment with the exception of the number of scans , which was reduced to 2 . A Sovitzky - Golay smoothing ﬁ lter was applied to smooth the baseline . An online CD analysis program , Dichroweb [ 51 ] , was used to estimate percentages of secondary struc - ture . 2 . 6 . Dynamic light scattering The Dynamic Light Scattering spectrum of cav sol was acquired on a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument . Cav sol was dialyzed into PBS and diluted from a concentration of ≈ 300 μ M to 8 μ M for DLS analysis . The spectrum was obtained from the backscatter , applying the general purpose analysis method with “ protein ” as the material and “ water ” as the dispersant at 20 °C . 2 . 7 . SEC The SEC spectrum of cav sol was acquired using a Bio - Rad BioLogic DuoFlow Chromatography system equipped with a GE HiLoad 16 / 60 Superdex 200 PG gel ﬁ ltration column . The gel ﬁ ltration standard ( Bio - Rad ) was dissolved in 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , and used for column calibration . Cav sol was refolded via dialysis into refolding bu ﬀ er as described above , and was puri ﬁ ed through the column described above . 2 . 8 . SEC coupled to multi - angle static light scattering ( SEC - MALS ) Protein samples at four concentrations , 120 , 361 , 724 , and 923 μ M were analyzed by static light scattering . Samples were auto - injected onto a aqueous gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) column ( A7000 , column 300 × 8 . 0 mm , Viscotek , Malvern ) at a ﬂ ow rate of 1 mL / min in bu ﬀ er ( 50 mM TrisHCl , pH 8 . 0 ) at a detector temperature of 20 °C and column temperature of 30 °C . The column is in - line with the following detectors : Viskotek 305 TDA MALS detector ( Malvern ) with a built - in refractometer ( refractive index detector ) , and Zetasizer μ V as a right angle light scattering ( RALS ) detector . The later , when attached to the GPC / SEC system generates absolute size and molecular weight of the samples . Masses were calculated with Malvern OmniSec software , with the dn / dc value set to 0 . 185 mL / g . BSA ( ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁ c ) was used as the calibration standard . 2 . 9 . Isothermal titration calorimetry ITC experiments were performed on a Malvern Microcal VP - ITC instrument . Nine injections of 5 μ L followed by thirty - six injections of 7 μ L of 300 μ M cav sol were added via a microsyringe in 400 s intervals to a solution of 62 . 5 μ M gp41 with stirring at 307 rpm in 50 mM Tris - HCl , 5 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol , pH 8 . 0 at 20 °C . Five injections of 5 μ L followed by thirty - three injections of 7 μ L of 300 μ M cav sol were added Table 1 Designing a library of cav variants for directed evolution . * S A L F G I P M A L I W G I Y F A I L S F L H I W A V V P - - R D - - - - - V N R - - D V - - - - V Q - - R - - C - - - H E - D - E - D S H - D E D - N D - E N - S H - D E - - - R D - I - M - V N R - I D F - H L - D H - N R - H D - - - - - - N - K - H T - - N - V - K H - - K - T - - L - - - - - - - V - V - L V - - V - Y - Q V - - Q - I - - V - - 104 108 112 116 120 124 128 132 wild - type gen - 1 library * Library substitutions shown in purple replaced key WT cav residues in the IMD to improve upon the ﬁ rst generation cav variant ( gen - 1 , green ) .

The experimental data were obtained from ﬁ tting the titration curve using the Origin software provided with the instrument . 2 . 10 . Cell culture and transfection The genes for WT cav and cav sol were cloned into a pBMN322 vector containing a mCherry tag ( Addgene ) ﬂ anked by Eco RI and Bam HI re - striction sites . The constructs were independently cloned into HEK 293 cells ( ATCC ) using 500 ng of DNA and lipofectamine 2000 reagent ( Invitrogen ) . HEK 293 cells were cultured in DMEM Media ( Life Technologies ) supplemented with antibiotics , sodium pyruvate , and 10 % v / v fetal bovine serum . Cells were grown for 72 h post - transfection at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 before being supplemented with media containing geneticin ( 500 μ g / mL , Life Technologies ) to select for successfully transfected cells . Cells were selected with geneticin for two weeks be - fore analysis by confocal microscopy . 2 . 11 . Confocal microscopy Transfected cells were grown on treated microscope slides ( Thermo Fisher ) for 3 days before ﬁ xation with 3 . 75 % glutaraldehyde solution for 10 min . The cells were stained with CellMask Green ( Thermo Fisher ) for 10 min , and then with DAPI before being sealed with a coverslip and analyzed for the ﬂ uorescence . Fluorescent images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope under a 60× objective with oil immersion . Images were analyzed using Velocity cell imaging software . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Phage - displayed selection of a soluble human cav variant Previously reported attempts to solubilize cav include isolation of cav - 11 [ 36 ] ( termed gen - 1a here ) , which guided the design of a new library of cav variants , termed gen - 2 ( Table 1 ) . Mutations targeted large , nonpolar , hydrophobic residues of the cav variant ' s in - tramembrane domain ( IMD ) . Such residues were altered through changes to their DNA to include charged , polar , and , when accessible with a maximum of four substitutions per codon , the WT amino acid . Codons encoding aromatic residues , for example , were replaced with a mixture of codons designating aspartic acid , glutamic acid , arginine , or histidine substitutions . Due to the degeneracy of the genetic code , some additional amino acid substitutions were included . For example , the library was designed to substitute M111 with either a Lys , Glu , or Met residue . However , to encode these mutations , a Val substitution was also included in the library . The library ' s actual diversity ( 7 . 0 × 10 [ 8 ] ) , as measured by titers following electroporation to form the li - brary , exceeded its theoretical diversity of 5 . 3 × 10 [ 8 ] variants . Dual positive and negative selections isolated members of the li - brary retaining both functionality and solubility , respectively ( Fig . 1a ) . The negative or subtractive selections removed hydrophobic variants adhering to hydrophobic interaction chromatography resin ( i . e . , binding to butyl sepharose ) . The subsequent positive or functional se - lections collected library members capable of folding and binding to gp41 . Each round of selections increased the stringency of both selec - tion conditions . Increasing the ionic strength of the bu ﬀ er , for example , strengthened the hydrophobic interactions during the subtractive se - lections for insolubility . Increasing the number of washes during the functional selections identi ﬁ ed more stable , better binding , and potentially better - folded cav variants ( Fig . 1b ) . After four rounds of selections for functionality and solubility , genes encoding the selected variants were ampli ﬁ ed by PCR and sub - cloned for protein overexpression in E . coli ( Fig . S1 ) . Several variants expressed to high levels in E . coli ( Fig . S2 ) . Sequence analysis of these variants identi ﬁ ed the IMD substitutions responsible for increasing cav solubility ( Table 2 ) . 3 . 2 . Expression , folding , and functional characterization of cav sol The cav variants identi ﬁ ed through the selection process over - express readily in E . coli inclusion bodies for subsequent protein folding . Unlike the gen - 1 selectants , no fusion to MBP was required . The variant exhibiting the highest levels of protein overexpression ( Fig . S2 ) , termed cav sol , was chosen for biophysical analysis ( Table 2 , gen 2d ) . After dissolving the inclusion bodies in urea and slowly removing the urea by multi - step dialysis , cav sol remained in solution . Puri ﬁ cation by FPLC using immobilized metal a ﬃ nity chromatography and SEC ( Fig . S3 ) yielded approximately 10 mg cav sol per liter of culture with an esti - mated homogeneity of 95 % by Image J analysis ( Fig . S3 ) [ 52 ] . To compare cav sol ' s functionality with WT cav , we examined the variant ' s ability to interact with cav ' s known binding partners , including gp41 , PKA , and PTRF . Cav sol bound to all three binding partners in a dose - dependent manner by ELISA ( Fig . 2A , B , and C ) . To investigate whether this binding was speci ﬁ c , cav sol ' s binding to a variety of ad - ditional , o ﬀ - target proteins was examined . Cav sol only binds to the known cav binding partners , and fails to bind any of the other o ﬀ - target proteins tested ( Fig . 2D ) . Taken together , the data strongly supports the hypothesis that cav sol forms the correct folding conformation expected for WT caveolin . 3 . 3 . Biophysical analysis of cav sol Two spectroscopic techniques measured cav sol ' s secondary structure and putative oligomeric states . Although cav sol appears unstable in pure , deionized water , the protein remains stable in bu ﬀ er ( e . g . , 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) for many weeks at 4 °C . Circular Dichroism ( CD ) was used to verify the protein folding ( Fig . 3A ) . Using Dichroweb , a tool for analyzing CD spectra [ 51 ] , cav sol was shown to include both α - helices and β - strands , The results are consistent with reported measurements with truncated cav variants [ 27 , 28 , 29 ] . Taken together , the CD and binding analysis suggest that cav sol folds correctly . Next we investigated perhaps the most de ﬁ ning characteristic of cav , its oligomerization to form caveolae [ 6 , 7 , 11 ] . To investigate cav sol ' s oligomeric state , we examined the particle size of cav sol at multiple concentrations using dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) . The DLS results show that cav sol increases in particle size proportionally with an increase in concentration ( Fig . 3B ) . Even at the lowest concentrations , cav sol is approximately 35 nm in diameter , ranging to approximately 90 nm at the highest concentration tested . This size indicates that cav sol forms large , concentration - dependent , oligomeric complexes . To estimate the molecular weight of the cav sol oligomers , the pro - tein was characterized at di ﬀ erent concentrations by SEC - MALS at - tached to a RALS detector . These detectors play an important role in gel permeation chromatography analysis because of their ability to directly measure molecular weight distribution [ 53 , 54 , 55 ] . During analysis , BSA , used as a calibration standard , had a molecular weight of 66 . 65 kDa , as expected . The highest concentration of cav sol , 923 μ M clogged the sample preparation ﬁ lters , and was not analyzed . However , molecular weights were calculated for the other protein concentrations . The three concentrations , 120 , 361 , and 724 μ M had average molecular weights of 350 kDa , 2000 kDa , and 3500 kDa respectively ( Fig . 3C ) ; the full widths of the peak at half maximum for these protein concentra - tions are 1 . 09 , 1 . 44 , and 1 . 56 min respectively . Therefore , with an in - crease in protein concentration , broader peak distributions are ob - served . Consistent with the DLS data , cav sol forms higher order oligomers with increased protein concentrations . In summary , two in - dependent measurements demonstrate cav sol forms large oligomeric complexes with an estimated copy number of > 50 cav sol units . J . N . Smith et al . BBA - Proteins and Proteomics 1866 ( 2018 ) 963 – 972 966 3 . 4 . Thermodynamic binding parameters between cav sol and binding partners Cav sol allows direct observation of cav ' s interactions with its binding partners . ITC was used to determine thermodynamic parameters be - tween cav sol ' s association with either gp41 or PKA . The titrations re - sulted in sigmoidal binding curves consistent with dose - dependent binding ( Fig . 4 ) . The ﬁ t for these curves follows a one - site binding model as determined through minimizing chi - squared for the ﬁ t to the curve ( Fig . 4 ) . Analysis of the ITC data reveals that cav sol binds with modest a ﬃ nity to both gp41 ( K D = 0 . 844 μ M ) and PKA ( K D = 0 . 670 μ M ) . The stoichiometry of binding is three molecules of cav sol per one gp41 or PKA molecule . Both binding events are exo - thermic and driven by enthalpic forces , rather than entropic con - siderations , as shown by the large , negative Δ H values ( Fig . 4b ) . 3 . 5 . The similar sub - cellular localization of both WT cav and cav sol in cultured mammalian cells To investigate whether or not cav sol could still bind to the lipid membrane , we observed the localization pattern of the variant in human mammalian cells . Cav sol and WT cav were fused with mCherry and transfected into HEK 293 cells . This cell line was chosen for its lack of caveolae resulting from low endogenous cav expression levels [ 56 ] . Confocal microscopy was then used to compare sub - cellular localization patterns of the two proteins ( Fig . 5 , Fig . S4 ) . The contrast of the mCherry and CellMask Green plasmid marker images was increased to emphasize the appearance of the cavWT or cav sol location and plasma membrane location respectively ( Fig . 5 ) . The image with original con - trast is also shown ( Fig . S4 ) . This data suggests that cav sol is still tar - geted to the membrane , and could function similarly to WT cav . 4 . Discussion Selections for cav solubility reveal preferred amino acid substitu - tions , and suggest strategies for the solubilization of other membrane proteins . The selections reported here identify caveolin variants capable of overexpression in E . coli ; as noted earlier , WT cav cannot be over - expressed in bacterial cells . An important caveat is that these selections require binding to a target ligand , here gp41 . Conceivably , the selected variant merely binds more tightly to gp41 , than WT cav . However , experiments described below validate the hypothesis for selection on the basis of increased protein solubility , stability , and expression yields . Presumably , binding to gp41 and other binding partners remains Fig . 1 . Selections for soluble and functional cav variants . ( A ) Schematic diagram detailing the selection and screening process . ( i . ) Negative selections removed hydrophobic , aggregation - prone variants . In the same round , ( ii . ) a positive selection tested binding to gp41 . ( iii . ) After four rounds of selections , the DNA from remaining variants was transformed into E . coli and ( iv . ) screened for protein overexpression . This schematic diagram is not drawn to scale . ( B ) Conditions used for increasing stringency in each round of selection . Higher ionic strength bu ﬀ er and additional washes increased the stringency of selection conditions for each round . To discourage nonspeci ﬁ c and o ﬀ - target binding , the blocking agent was varied during rounds of selections . J . N . Smith et al . BBA - Proteins and Proteomics 1866 ( 2018 ) 963 – 972 967 una ﬀ ected , as residues in the CSD were not targeted by the library . The reported strategy should be applicable to any protein capable of display on the phage surface and separately a known , overexpressed binding target . As shown previously , MP phage display can include monotopic proteins like cav , but also transmembrane proteins , including ß - barrel MPs [ 49 ] . Comparing the sequences of several overexpressing cav variants isolated from the fourth round of gen - 2 selections reveals important trends required for MP solubilization ( Table 2 ) . Overall , the vast ma - jority of IMD substitutions found in these selectants encoded for polar amino acids , which validates the library design and solubilization strategy . However , several variants strongly selected nonpolar residues ( e . g . , valine ) in speci ﬁ c IMD positions . For example , residues I117 and L122 were replaced with valine in the gen - 2 selectants ; far less pre - ference for this non - polar residue was observed in the ﬁ rst generation of selections . The retention of nonpolar amino acids in these positions illustrates their importance to cav function and possibly structure in spite of strong selection for solubilizing amino acid sidechains . Thus , including the possibility for selecting WT residues appears critical to successful library - based MP solubilization . Cav selectants for solubility from both gen - 1 and gen - 2 libraries strongly preferred charged amino acids at positions 106 , 107 , 115 , 118 , and 128 to replace hydrophobic sidechains . The addition of charged amino acids at these positions can increase protein solubility , while retaining cav function . Compared to gen - 1a , cav sol from gen - 2 includes three additional charged amino acids at positions 124 , 130 , and 131 . Glu and Asp were substituted interchangeably amongst the selected variants ; therefore , the evolution conditions selected for sidechain charge , not structure . Aromatic amino acids at positions 107 , 115 , 118 , and 128 were replaced with an Asp , Glu , Arg , or His residue in 89 % of Table 2 Cav variants selected for solubility and function .

( D ) Notably , cav sol does not bind nonspeci ﬁ cally to o ﬀ - target proteins . All error bars report standard deviation from the mean ( n = 3 ) . J . N . Smith et al . BBA - Proteins and Proteomics 1866 ( 2018 ) 963 – 972 968 the sequences selected . Interestingly , both Phe residues ( positions 119 and 124 ) were replaced with a charged residue only 50 % of the time . The remaining 50 % retained the aromatic residue , or replaced it with a Val residue . The increased charge of gen - 2 selectants could explain their greater solubility . Cav functions as a protein sca ﬀ old , and mediates diverse cellular processes ranging from signal transduction to membrane tra ﬃ cking [ 7 ] . Signi ﬁ cantly , cav sol retains the WT protein ' s ability to bind to gp41 and PKA as required for cav function . Furthermore , cav sol ' s binding to gp41 illustrates an unusual function of cav for preventing membrane hemifusion during viral assembly [ 38 ] . The direct cav - PTRF interaction remains little - explored , but is clearly supported through binding assays reported here with cav sol and in other studies [ 31 , 36 ] . Caveolae spon - taneously disassemble upon loss of PTRF . These results support a model where cav localizes several binding partners near the cell membrane and can interact directly with PTRF to form caveolae . Cav sol ' s binding thermodynamics with gp41 and PKA were directly measured by ITC ( Fig . 4 ) . Both gp41 and PKA bind cav sol with low micromolar K D . Determining the stoichiometry of an interaction by ITC requires knowledge about the oligomerization state of the interacting species . For example , gp41 predominantly forms a dimer during bac - terial overexpression ( Fig . S5 ) , and PKA remains monomeric . For both data sets , a single site binding model ﬁ t the ITC data best to minimize Chi [ 2 ] / DoF ( Fig . 4B ) . The data also supports a model in which ap - proximately three cav sol molecules bind to each molecule of either di - meric gp41 or monomeric PKA . As shown by DLS and SEC - MALS ( Fig . 3B , C ) , the oligomeric state of cav sol increases with concentration . The concentration of cav sol during ITC analysis was 300 μ M . The ob - served molecular weight of cav sol by SEC - MALS at a similar con - centration ( 361 μ M ) was 2000 kDa equating to a complex consisting of ≈ 90 cav monomers . Thus , the ITC data suggests each oligomer of ≈ 90 cav sol binds up to thirty ligands ; the similar apparent a ﬃ nities for gp41 and PKA measured here likely result in an equal molar distribution , assuming equal concentrations of each protein , of complexes with ap - proximately ﬁ fteen of each protein binding to cav sol . Cav sol uniquely allows analysis of the secondary structure for a full - length cav construct in the presence of di ﬀ erent environments . The addition of dodecyl phosphatidylcholine micelles causes negligible di ﬀ erence in the CD spectra of cav sol ( Fig . S6 ) . Thus , cav sol retains its secondary structure in the presence this environment ; the protein folds independently of the presence of a putative membrane mimic . This conclusion is further supported by cav sol ' s high solubility without re - quiring the addition of detergent . Additional CD analysis reveals a high percentage of α - helical secondary structure ( 36 % ) in cav sol as shown by both the Dichroweb analysis and in characteristic depressions of the CD spectrum at approximately 215 and 207 nm [ 51 ] ( Fig . 3A ) . This sec - ondary structure analysis also suggests the presence of a moderate de - gree of β - strands ( 18 % ) ; similar results were obtained from analysis of a portion of the CSD by van der Wel and colleagues [ 28 ] . The disorder ( 21 % ) observed in the CD spectra of cav sol suggests that some regions of the protein could be ﬂ exible and dynamic , a known property of its N - terminal domain [ 57 ] . In summary , this data provides the ﬁ rst direct measurement of the secondary structure of a full - length variant of cav , and ﬁ nds support for a hybrid of the many models proposed for this protein . Cav is widely recognized to form homoligomers inside the cell at the plasma membrane . Estimates of cav monomers per complex vary widely depending upon cell type , cellular location , and analytical technique used ( Table S1 ) . Early characterization of cav oligomers applied gradient centrifugation ; the observed complexes consisted of 200 , 400 , or 600 kDa , which corresponds with approximately 9 , 18 , and 27 cav monomers respectively [ 58 ] . Furthermore , complexes comprised of cav monomers have been observed in mouse ﬁ broblasts [ 59 ] . Cav sol oligomerizes spontaneously upon refolding at modest concentrations ( 10 – 15 μ M ) . As observed by DLS and SEC - MALS the protein rapidly forms higher order oligomers with increased protein concentrations . As Fig . 3 . Biophysical characterization of cav sol . ( A ) CD spectrum of cav sol . The CD spectrum of cav sol reveals a highly helical secondary structure with some dis - ordered regions and β - strands . The spectrum was obtained from averaging six continuous scans ( B ) Particle size of cav sol at varying concentrations . Analysis by DLS shows a large particle size which increases proportionally with con - centration . This suggests that cav sol exists in an oligomeric form . Error bars denote standard deviation ( n = 3 ) . ( C ) . SEC - MALS analysis of the cav sol protein at three di ﬀ erent concentrations . The SEC - MALS / RI / RALS were used to de - termine the cav sol molecular masses using Malvern OmniSEC software . Chromatograms show the readings from the light scattering at 90° for the three di ﬀ erent protein concentrations ( 120 , 361 , and 724 μ M ) . The left and right axes represent the light scattering detector reading and molecular mass , respec - tively . The lines across the peaks indicate molar mass and homogeneity . Calculated molar masses are indicated . J . N . Smith et al . BBA - Proteins and Proteomics 1866 ( 2018 ) 963 – 972 969 observed by SEC - MALS , the MW ranged from 350 to 3500 kDa with increasing protein concentration . At the highest protein concentration analyzed by SEC - MALS , we estimate ≈ 160 cav monomers contribute to form the oligomeric complex , which provides the MW of 3 . 5 mDa ( Fig . 3B , and C ) . These oligomers are very stable , and remain intact for weeks after formation despite 1000 - fold dilution of the protein . More - over , a broad range of oligomers form , as shown by the variation in particle size at increasing concentrations ( Fig . 3B ) and the hetero - geneity of the observed MW within each concentration monitored by SEC - MALS ( Fig . 3C ) . Interestingly , the particle size of the most con - centrated oligomer measured by DLS ( 88 nm ) is consistent with the approximate size observed for caveolae ( 50 – 100 nm ) [ 6 , 7 ] . Further - more , the DLS spectra suggest that cav sol is not disproportionally long or wide in nature . For example , long rod - like proteins would show two distinct species by DLS : one species showing the diameter of the length of the rod , and another showing the width of the rod . Only one statis - tical distribution , although not homogenous as shown by the broadness of the peak , is observed in the DLS spectra of cav sol , further supporting that cav sol oligomers are largely symmetrical in nature . We investigated cav sol and WT cav localization in HEK 293 cells . The two proteins appear to localize to the same spots in the cell , pre - dominantly the cellular membrane ( Fig . 5 , white arrows ) . Cav is known to have both N - terminal and C - terminal membrane binding domains that are required for internalization of the IMD . A construct containing only the IMD and not the membrane binding domains failed to inter - nalize into the membrane [ 60 ] . The ability of cav sol to localize at the cellular membrane despite substitutions to the IMD supports this ob - servation , since the membrane binding domains were undisturbed . Both , WT cav and cav sol appear not only to localize in the membrane , but also to form protein clusters at the membrane . Unfortunately , limits to the resolution of confocal microscopy prevent us from identifying these clusters as caveolae . In summary , the microscopy presented here demonstrates that substitutions to the cav IMD did not a ﬀ ect cav sol ' s ability to localize to the cell membrane . In conclusion , we report the selection of the ﬁ rst known full - length cav variant able to overexpress to high levels in E . coli and remain so - luble in vitro upon refolding . The variant , cav sol , was shown by ELISA and ITC to interact with known binding partners , gp41 , PKA , and PTRF , and exhibits the expected secondary structural characteristics evident in its CD spectrum . Cav sol oligomerizes in a concentration - dependent manner into large complexes of 24 monomers approximately 88 nm in diameter as observed by SEC and DLS respectively at high concentra - tions . Despite substitutions to the IMD , cav sol retains the localization associated with WT cav , including the cellular membrane . We have reported a small peptide capable of binding to cav sol and disrupting its oligomerization [ 40 ] ; this demonstrates that cav sol provides a potential therapeutic target for drug development . Overall , cav sol provides a powerful new tool for investigating the properties of cav structure and function .
