Volume 29 February 1 , 2018 295 MBoC | ARTICLE High - speed superresolution imaging of the proteins in fission yeast clathrin - mediated endocytic actin patches ABSTRACT To internalize nutrients and cell surface receptors via clathrin - mediated endocy - tosis , cells assemble at least 50 proteins , including clathrin , clathrin - interacting proteins , actin filaments , and actin binding proteins , in a highly ordered and regulated manner . The mole - cular mechanism by which actin filament polymerization deforms the cell membrane is un - known , largely due to lack of knowledge about the organization of the regulatory proteins and actin filaments . We used high - speed superresolution localization microscopy of live fis - sion yeast cells to improve the spatial resolution to ∼ 35 nm with 1 - s temporal resolution . The nucleation promoting factors Wsp1p ( WASp ) and Myo1p ( myosin - I ) define two independent pathways that recruit Arp2 / 3 complex , which assembles two zones of actin filaments . Myo1p concentrates at the site of endocytosis and initiates a zone of actin filaments assembled by Arp2 / 3 complex . Wsp1p appears simultaneously at this site but subsequently moves away from the cell surface as it stimulates Arp2 / 3 complex to assemble a second zone of actin fila - ments . Cells lacking either nucleation - promoting factor assemble only one , stationary , zone of actin filaments . These observations support our two - zone hypothesis to explain endocytic tubule elongation and vesicle scission in fission yeast . INTRODUCTION Clathrin - mediated endocytosis recycles membrane receptors and takes up nutrients . Studies of budding yeast , fission yeast , and ani - mal cells identified many proteins that assemble and disassemble at endocytic sites . Recruitment of membrane proteins that recognize the endocytic cargo initiates the process at nascent endocytic sites . These sites mature with the assembly of a clathrin coat and recruit - ment of nucleation promoting factors and Arp2 / 3 complex that stim - ulate actin polymerization . Yeast cells use mechanical force provided by actin polymerization to overcome the internal turgor pressure and deform the membrane ( Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough , 2009 ; Minc et al . , 2009 ; Schaber et al . , 2010 ; Basu et al . , 2014 ) . However , it is still unclear how actin polymerization generates force to reshape the membrane , because conventional fluorescence microscopy has not resolved the organization of actin filaments or established the sites of actin polymerization . One model based on the localization of the nucleation promoting factors , myosin - I and WASp ( Las17 ) in budding yeast , proposes that the actin filaments polymerize against the plasma membrane at the neck of endocytic invaginations . Consequently , the barbed ends of the elongating ac - tin filaments are oriented toward the plasma membrane at the base of the membrane invagination with their pointed ends anchored to the clathrin coat via the adapter proteins at the invagination tip ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Skruzny et al . , 2012 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) . Actin polymerization primarily at the plasma membrane together with some myosin motor activity is proposed to generate force to elon - gate the membrane tubule . On the basis of the localization of the nucleation promoting fac - tors in fission yeast , we proposed another model to explain how actin polymerization drives endocytosis ( Arasada and Pollard , 2011 ) . In our model , actin polymerization occurs in two distinct zones : one Monitoring Editor David G .

Arasada et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell Over time , all of the fluorescent proteins within the ∼ 400 - nm - thick imaging plane were localized with an average radial precision of 21 ± 4 nm , and the centroids of each molecule were plotted as two - dimensional histograms ( Figure 1B , middle panel ) . Software rejected molecules outside the imaging plane during image processing . To aid visualization the two - dimensional histograms of centroids of at the base of the membrane invagination and the other traveling with the tip of the invagination . This model postulates that the ex - panding actin networks in the two zones repel each other as they grow , driving invagination of the plasma membrane tubule . This two - zone model is based on quantitative measurements by confocal fluorescence microscopy of fission yeast actin patch pro - teins fused to mEGFP or mYFP ( Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ; Arasada and Pollard , 2011 ) . Two activators of Arp2 / 3 complex , type - I myosin Myo1p and WASp homologue Wsp1p , localize and initiate actin po - lymerization together but then separate with Myo1p at the base of plasma membrane invagination and Wsp1p at the tip of the invagi - nation ( Figure 1A ) . These nucleation promoting factors recruit very high densities ( ∼ 20 , 000 molecules per µm 2 ) of two F - BAR ( Fes / CIP4 homology Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs ) proteins , Cdc15p and Bzz1p , onto the invaginating membrane tubule . Cdc15p interacts with Myo1p at the base of the membrane tubule and Bzz1p interacts with Wsp1p at the invagination tip . The F - BAR proteins interact with the nucle - ation promoting factors to stimulate Arp2 / 3 complex in two zones along the invaginating tubule . However , in yeast cells expressing GFP - actin or GFP - tagged proteins that bind actin filaments , the dense network of ∼ 5000 polymerized actin molecules appears as a single mass of homogeneous fluorescence ∼ 500 nm in diameter at sites of endocytosis rather than as two distinct polymerization zones ( Arasada and Pollard , 2011 ) . Better spatial resolution was required to determine whether actin polymerizes in two zones . Since the two yeast cells diverged from a common ancestor ∼ 400 million years ago and have adapted differently during their subse - quent evolution , they may control actin assembly during endocyto - sis in different ways . On the other hand , it is worth considering whether endocytosis in the two yeasts has more in common than suggested by these two models . We used high - speed fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy ( FPALM ) of live Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells ex - pressing photoconvertible fluorescent proteins ( Huang et al . , 2013 ; Laplante et al . , 2016a , b ) to study the organization of proteins in ac - tin patches . We obtained 1 - s temporal resolution and ∼ 35 - nm spa - tial resolution and observed that actin filaments assemble in two zones : one at the base of the membrane invagination and the other at the tip of the invagination . Polymerization of actin in both zones depends on Arp2 / 3 complex , which is activated by type - I myosin Myo1p at the base of the invagination and WASp homologue Wsp1p along the path of the invagination from the cell surface to the tip of the membrane tubule . These observations support the two - zone hypothesis for the assembly of actin in association with endocytosis in fission yeast . RESULTS Observations of protein turnover in actin patches of live fission yeast cells by FPALM We examined actin filaments and four components of the actin as - sembly machinery in live fission yeast using a single - molecule , su - perresolution method , FPALM ( also called STORM or PALM ) ( Huang et al . , 2013 ; Laplante et al . , 2016a ) . We tagged proteins with the photoconvertible fluorescent proteins mMaple3 or mEOS3 . 2 at their gene loci unless indicated otherwise . The cell in Figure 1 , B and C expressed the actin patch component capping protein Acp2p tagged with mEOS3 . 2 . We used epifluorescence illumination to ex - pose live S . pombe cells expressing photoconvertible fluorescent proteins continuously with both a near UV laser ( 405 nm ) to photo - convert the fluorescent proteins randomly to the state that emits red light and a yellow laser ( 564 nm ) to image the red light emitted by individual , spatially separated , photoconverted fluorescent proteins .

The cartoon represents an actin patch at – 2 s when the membrane tubule elongates and at 0 s when the vesicle pinches away from the plasma membrane .

Volume 29 February 1 , 2018 Organization of S . pombe a ctin patches | 297 ( Figure 2B , center micrograph ) . The clusters of mMaple3 - Wsp1p maintained a constant size with a width of 100 ± 38 nm and length of 200 nm ( Figure 2 , C and D , center graphs ) as they moved from the membrane proximal zone to the membrane distal zone ( a box ∼ 250 nm wide located in the cytoplasm between 200 and 550 nm from the cell edge ) ( Figure 2E , middle panel , and Supplemental Figure S1B ) . mMaple3 - Wsp1p appeared in the membrane proximal zone and peaked there at ∼ 50 localizations per second . The peak of ∼ 50 mMaple3 - Wsp1p localizations per second in the membrane distal zone was ∼ 6 s later . The localizations of Arc5p - mMaple3 ( the marker for Arp2 / 3 com - plex ) appeared first at the plasma membrane and then deeper in the cytoplasm at later times ( Figure 2A , bottom panel ) , as illustrated by composite images with temporal color coding ( Figure 2B , right micrograph ) . Throughout this shift in the localizations over time , clusters of Arc5p - mMaple3 were 122 ± 62 nm wide and 300 nm long ( Figure 2 , C and D , right panels ) . Like mMaple3 - Wsp1p , the localiza - tions of Arc5p - mMaple3 molecules first peaked at ∼ 150 per second in the membrane proximal zone followed ∼ 5 s later by a peak in membrane distal zone ( Figure 2E , right panel , and Supplemental Figure S1C ) . Actin assembles in two distinct zones in an actin patch We localized actin filaments indirectly with two different probes : 1 ) an actin filament binding protein fimbrin ( Fim1p ) tagged to mEOS3 . 2 at its C - terminus and expressed from the endoge - nous locus ; and 2 ) calponin homology domain ( CHD ) from the S . pombe IQGAP protein Rng2p fused to mEOS3 . 2 at its N termi - nus and expressed ectopically from a repressible promoter at the leu1 + locus ( Figure 3 ) . Fim1p - mEOS3 . 2 expressed from the native promoter has minimal impact on the organization of actin filaments at endocytic sites ( Berro and Pollard , 2014b , a ) . CHD tagged with a fluorescent protein binds actin filaments , but it also appears to bundle actin filaments and may influence cell mor - phology when overexpressed . The time course of the appear - ance and disappearance of Fim1p - mEOS3 . 2 in patches ( Figure 3H ) was similar to a trace of Fim1p - mGFP or Fim1p - mCherry ob - served by confocal microscopy ( Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ; Berro and Pollard , 2014a ) . Both actin filament probes appeared in two distinct zones at sites of endocytosis ( Figure 3 , A and B ) , first close to the plasma mem - brane and then in a second zone further from the plasma mem - brane . Throughout their existence , the clusters of single molecule localizations of mEOS3 . 2 - CHD in patches were 110 ± 55 nm wide ( along the cell long axis ) and 350 nm long , while those of Fim1p - mEOS3 . 2 were 101 ± 36 nm wide and 300 nm long , both with two distinct peaks ( Figure 3 , C – F ) . Reconstructions of series of images ( Figure 3A ) with temporal color - coding emphasize that actin assem - bly begins at the plasma membrane and shifts to a site deeper in the cytoplasm over time ( Figure 3 , G and H ) . Like Arp2 / 3 complex , the mEOS3 . 2 - CHD and Fim1p - mEOS3 . 2 first peaked at ∼ 150 localiza - tions per second in the membrane proximal zone followed ∼ 4 s later by a peak in the membrane distal zone ( Figure 3 , I and J , and Sup - plemental Figure S1 , D and E ) . Starting at time 0 s , the localizations of each actin patch protein declined and appeared further from the plasma membrane . At the onset of patch assembly and up to time zero , the localizations of the patch proteins were tightly packed in a column normal to the plasma membrane . After time zero , the positions of these localizations be - came more variable and more spread out . The localizations colored in red at the end of the disassembly phase were more spread out and noisy due to fewer localizations . localized molecules were convolved with a two - dimensional Gauss - ian kernel ( σ = 7 . 5 nm ) and color coded for localization density ( Figure 1B , bottom panel ) . It is important to note that photoactivation localization mi - croscopy depends on irreversibly photobleaching each fluores - cent protein after it is imaged and localized , so a time series of FPALM images reveals the position of each molecule when it is photoconverted . Photobleaching occurs in less than 2 s under our conditions ( Laplante et al . , 2016b ) . However , the method does not reveal the subsequent history of the photobleached protein , such as its persistence at the site of localization or any motion . Actin patches concentrate at the poles of the cells but are spread around the surface , so they are viewed from many differ - ent angles . Therefore , we used differential interference contrast ( DIC ) microscopy to identify the midplane of the cells , where ac - tin patches moving in the XY - plane of the microscope were con - tained in the optical section throughout their lifetimes . To obtain enough single - molecule localizations to form an image , we com - bined groups of 200 sequential 5 - ms frames . These 1 - s compos - ite images were linked into movies or montages to show actin patch dynamics . These FPALM images highlight structural details of actin patches that appear as blurred , pixelated spots of fluo - rescence by wide - field fluorescence micro scopy ( Figure 1C , top panel ) . Localization of Arp2 / 3 complex activators and Arp2 / 3 complex We tagged three proteins that control the assembly of actin fila - ments at sites of endocytosis and established their distributions over time in actin patches . We inserted the open reading frame for mMaple3 ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) into the genome so the fluorescent protein was fused to the N - termini of Arp2 / 3 complex activators myosin - I ( Myo1p ) and Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( Wsp1p ) and on the C - terminus of the Arc5p ( ARPC5 ) subunit of Arp2 / 3 complex , so all of the tagged proteins were expressed from their endogenous promoters . Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells ex - pressing these fusion proteins were viable and had wild - type morphologies at 25° and 36°C . In wild - type cells , localizations of mMaple3 - Myo1p appeared in a small , stationary region 65 ± 18 nm ( mean ± SD ) wide and extending 85 ± 18 nm from the plasma membrane ( Figure 2 , A , C , and D , left graphs ) as actin patches assembled and disassembled over time ( Figure 2A , top panel ) . A composite image with tempo - ral color coding according to the time of localization shows the time course of the whole process ( Figure 2B , left micrograph ) . Counts of mMaple3 - Myo1p localizations in actin patches over time established that 82 % of Myo1p localizations appeared and disappeared within membrane proximal zone ( defined as box ∼ 250 nm wide , extending 200 nm into the cytoplasm from the cell edge ) ( left panels in Figure 2B and and Supplemental Figure S1A ) . These observations confirmed at much higher resolution the lack of mobility of Myo1p tagged with mEGFP ( monomeric enhanced green fluorescent protein ) and imaged by confocal microscopy ( Sirotkin et al . , 2005 , 2010 ) . Over ∼ 15 s , mMaple3 - Wsp1p appeared at the plasma mem - brane and subsequently was localized along a trajectory normal to the membrane ( middle column of Figure 2 , B – E ) , similarly to lower - resolution confocal micrographs of cells expressing mEGFP - Wsp1p ( Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ) . Reconstructions of time series with temporal color - coding illustrate that mMaple3 - Wsp1p molecules were local - ized up to 300 nm from the plasma membrane at late time points 298 | R . Arasada et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell Assembly of two zones of actin is required for endocytic tubule elongation and vesicle scission from the plasma membrane Both Myo1p and Wsp1p contribute to ac - tivating Arp2 / 3 complex and the assembly actin filaments at sites of endocytosis in fis - sion yeast . Both ∆ wsp1 and ∆ myo1 mutant cells are viable with defects in endocytosis , but double mutant ∆ wsp1 ∆ myo1 cells are not viable ( Lee et al . , 2000 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ) . We investigated the relationships among Myo1p , Wsp1p , Arp2 / 3 complex , and actin filaments by analyzing ∆ wsp1 yeast cells lacking Wsp1p or ∆ myo1 cells lacking Myo1p ( Figure 4 ) . We compared the distribution of Arc5p - mMaple3 and mEOS3 . 2 - CHD in the mutant strains with wild - type cells . Both single deletion strains differed from wild - type cells in two regards : 1 ) they accumulated far less Arc5p - mMaple3 than FIGURE 2 : Localization of nucleation promoting factors and Arp2 / 3 complex in actin patches by FPALM in wild - type cells .

Thus , few Arc5p - mMaple3 molecules were localized in the membrane distal zone at any time ( Figure 4E and Supplemen - tal Figure S2A ) . In cells lacking either Myo1p or Wsp1p , the actin filament marker mEOS3 . 2 - CHD remained close to the plasma membrane and per - sisted there longer than in wild - type cells ( Figure 4F and Suppleme - mental Figure S2B ) . The peak numbers of mEOS3 . 2 - CHD localiza - tions in membrane proximal zones of actin patches were similar in wild - type cells and cells without Myo1p or Wsp1p , but few of the localizations appeared in the membrane distal zone . DISCUSSION High - speed FPALM increases the spatial resolution nearly 10 - fold compared with confocal microscopy and is fast enough to follow the assembly and disassembly of actin patches . We used the estab - lished timing of GFP - tagged proteins ( Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ; Arasada and Pollard , 2011 ) to align the timing of the superresolution micro - scopy data , with 0 s as the time when some of the patch compo - nents start to move away from the cell surface after vesicle scission ( Figure 5 ) . High - resolution images aligned in this way at 1 - s intervals helped us distinguish elongation of the membrane tubule from ves - icle scission and support the two - zone hypothesis . Note that after random photoconversion FPALM irreversibly bleaches each fluorescent protein in the imaging beam in ∼ 2 s ( Laplante et al . , 2016b ) , so the method does not reveal how long each molecule persists at its detected location . Thus , the absence of localizations does not necessarily mean that the tagged protein has turned over . For example , actin may persist longer in the membrane proximal zone than the detection of newly localized proteins . Status of the two - zone hypothesis The key feature of the two - zone hypothesis is that the two major nucleation promoting factors , Myo1p and Wsp1p , are distributed differently on the membrane tubules , so they can drive the reactions FIGURE 3 : Localization of actin filaments in two zones in endocytic actin patches in wild - type S . pombe cells .

In both yeasts , WASp initially concentrates near the plasma membrane and recruits the F - BAR protein Bzz1p , which increases the ability of Wsp1p to activate Arp2 / 3 complex to assemble actin filaments ( Padrick et al . , 2008 ; Arasada and Pollard , 2011 ) . The main difference is the subsequent behavior of WASp . The current work confirms that fission yeast Wsp1p moves away from the cell surface along with Arp2 / 3 complex and actin filaments ( Arasada and Pollard , 2011 ) , while multiple papers ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Sun et al . , 2006 , 2017 ; Rajmohan et al . , 2009 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) show that budding yeast Las17 - GFP remains close to the cell sur - face during endocytosis . Consistent with a single zone of nucleation promoting factors in budding yeast , elegant photobleaching ex - periments showed that actin filaments appear at the base of the membrane invagination ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . The accumulated work suggests that the behavior of WASp dif - fers in the two yeasts , supporting a single zone of actin assembly in budding yeast and two zones in fission yeast . Exploring this differ - ence is worthwhile for two reasons . First , tagging Las17 or Wsp1p can influence their behavior . Growth and the time course of patch assembly are normal in fission yeast cells dependent on mGFP - Wsp1p ( Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ) , rather than growing slowly like mis - shapen , temperature - sensitive ∆ wsp1 cells . However , the GFP - Wsp1p strain has defects in mating and sporulation , as observed in ∆ wsp1 cells . Tagging either end of Las17 with GFP may compro - mise patch mobility ( Galletta et al . , 2008 ) . Second , electron micros - copy of sections of chemically fixed budding yeast cells treated with gold - labeled antibodies showed that Las17 with a small C - terminal HA peptide tag distributed significantly further than myo - sin - I along endocytic membrane invaginations as they elongated ( p < 0 . 001 ) . However , chemical fixation may have compromised the preservation . High - pressure freezing followed by freeze substitu - tion improves the preservation and is compatible with antibody staining for electron microscopy ( Buser and Drubin , 2013 ) or cor - relative fluorescence and electron tomography ( Kukulski et al . , 2012 ) , but neither Las17 nor myosin - I have been localized by these methods . Wsp1p begins at time – 3 s coincident with the peak of Wsp1p local - izations and the accumulation of localizations in the membrane dis - tal zone of Arp2 / 3 complex ( Arc5p ) and actin filaments ( CHD and Fim1p ) . Localizations of both Arp2 / 3 complex and actin filaments peak at time 0 s . Both Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 3B ) and actin ( Figure 2 , H and I ) form two spatially and temporally separated networks of about the same size . Judging from their sudden increase in mobility , patches pinch off from the membrane with most of the actin network at time 0 s ( Berro and Pollard , 2014b , a ) . After time 0 , patches diffuse in the cytoplasm at increasing rates as they disassemble their actin filament coat over 6 s ( Berro and Pollard , 2014b , a ) . Localizations of Arc5p , CHD , and Fim1p decline more rapidly in the membrane proximal zone than the membrane distal region . These proteins may dissociate from the patch or persist after they are localized . The sudden collapse of the membrane tubule after vesicle scission might be a factor in dispers - ing the actin . How much does endocytosis in fission and budding yeast have in common ? In spite of differences in a few observations , most evidence sup - ports the conclusion that the mechanisms of endocytosis in bud - ding yeast and fission yeast are fundamentally the same . The two yeasts have a common ancestor and use most of the same pro - teins to form a membrane invagination ∼ 150 nm long surrounded by actin filaments ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ; Arasada and Pollard , 2011 ; Goode et al . , 2015 ; Lu et al . , 2016 ) . Actin polymerization in both yeasts depends on Arp2 / 3 complex and two types of nucleation promoting factors , myosin - I ( MYO3 and MYO5 in budding yeast and Myo1p in fission yeast ) and WASp homologues ( LAS17 in budding yeast and Wsp1p in fission yeast ) . In both the yeasts , myosin - I appears near the plasma membrane at the base of the tubular invagination ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Sun et al . , 2006 ; Galletta et al . , 2008 ; Idrissi et al . , 2008 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ) and recruits Arp2 / 3 complex to nucleate branched actin fila - ments that give rise to the membrane - proximal network of fila - ments . In both yeasts , interactions of myosin - Is with adapter and coat proteins ( Sun et al . , 2006 ; Barker et al . , 2007 ; Arasada and Pollard , 2011 ) are important for efficient endocytosis . For example , recruitment of F - BAR protein Cdc15p to the endocytic site enhances FIGURE 5 : Hypothesis for the contributions of the nucleation promoting factors Myo1p and Wsp1p to endocytosis . Different stages of endocytosis with time zero defined as vesicle scission from the plasma membrane . The plasma membrane is a black line , clathrin is gray , nucleation promoting factors Wsp1p and Myo1p are blue , and actin filaments are red , green , and yellow . Clathrin is recruited 2 min prior to invagination . Nucleation promoting factors are recruited beginning at – 6 s and peak prior to patch movement at – 3 s . Myo1p and Wsp1p both stimulate actin polymerization at the base of the invagination near the cell surface . As the actin zones around Myo1p and Wsp1p grow , they repel each other , driving membrane invagination and redistribution of Wsp1p away from the base along the membrane invagination creating new sites of actin polymerization at the invagination tip . Myo1p remains associated with the plasma membrane at the base of the invagination . The expansion of the two zones triggers vesicle scission between the two zones of actin at time 0 s . 302 | R . Arasada et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell Models of actin assembly Understanding the forces produced by actin assembly during endo - cytosis depends on knowing the sites of assembly and the orienta - tions of the filaments . Electron microscopy of chemically fixed and freeze - substituted yeast cells ( Idrissi et al . , 2008 ) , platinum replicas of fixed and extracted animal cells ( Collins et al . , 2011 ) , and quanti - tative fluorescence microscopy of live cells ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2005 , 2010 ; Berro et al . , 2010 ; Berro and Pollard , 2014b , a ; Arasada and Pollard , 2011 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) have sug - gested three possible orientations of filaments in actin patches as follows : 1 ) actin filaments are assembled from the plasma mem - brane with barbed ends oriented toward the plasma membrane ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) ; 2 ) actin filaments are oriented with the barbed ends pointed toward the tip of the mem - brane invagination ( Collins et al . , 2011 ) ; and 3 ) very short actin filaments ( Young et al . , 2004 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2005 , 2010 ; Berro et al . , 2010 ; Berro and Pollard , 2014b , a ; Arasada and Pollard , 2011 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) are oriented randomly in one zone ( Young et al . , 2004 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2005 , 2010 ; Berro et al . , 2010 ; Berro and Pollard , 2014b , a ; Arasada and Pollard , 2011 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) or two zones ( Arasada and Pollard , 2011 ) . Model 3 with two zones is simpler and more appealing to us , because it does not require mechanisms to orient the filaments . Dis - tinguishing these hypotheses definitively will require methods to document the arrangement of individual filaments . MATERIALS AND METHODS Strain construction , growth conditions , and yeast methods Supplemental Table S1 lists the S . pombe strains used in this study . Fluorescent protein ( FP ) tag sequences were integrated into the genome by PCR - based gene tagging ( Bahler et al . , 1998 ) . All ge - nomic integrations were confirmed by PCR and fluorescence mi - croscopy . We used plasmid pFA6a - mEos3 . 2 - kanMX6 to tag pro - teins with mEOS3 . 2 at their endogenous genomic loci ( Laplante et al . , 2016b ) . We constructed plasmid pFA6a - mMaple3 - KanMX6 to tag proteins at their endogenous loci with mMaple3 . mMaple3 cDNA was PCR amplified and replaced mEOS3 . 2 in pFA6a - mEos2 - kanMX6 . We constructed pFA6a - kanMX6 - Pmyo1 - mMaple3 and pFA6a - kanMX6 - Pwsp1 - mMaple3 plasmids for N - terminal tagging of Myo1p and Wsp1p . We PCR amplified the coding sequence of mMaple3 ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) and replaced the mEGFP coding sequence of pFA6a - kanMX6 - Pmyo1 - mEGFP and pFA6a - kanMX6 - Pmyo1 - mEGFP using the restriction sites Pac I and Asc I ( Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ) . Actin filaments were visualized indirectly with either with Fim1p - mEOS3 . 2 or with Rng2p CHD . To express mEOS3 . 2 - CHD or GFP - CHD , cells expressing mEOS3 . 2 - CHD or GFP - CHD under the control of a 41x nmt1 promoter were grown in Edinburgh minimal media ( EMM5S ) for 18 h before imaging . Preparation of cells for imaging All S . pombe cells expressing a fluorescently tagged protein were grown in YE5S at 25°C to OD 595 0 . 2 – 0 . 5 , washed in EMM5S filtered through a 0 . 45 - µm filter , and mounted on 25 % gelatin pads in fil - tered EMM5S . DIC images were collected prior to superresolution imaging . Superresolution data acquisition , data analysis , and display Superresolution imaging was performed with a custom - built two - dimensional FPALM system ( Huang et al . , 2013 ; Laplante et al . , 2016a , b ) equipped with a scientific complementary metal - oxide - semiconductor ( sCMOS ) camera ( ORCA - Flash4 . 0 ; Hamamatsu ) . Wide - field epifluorescence optics were used to illuminate cells simultaneously with a near - UV laser ( 405 nm ) to photoconvert small numbers of random fluorescent proteins and 564 - nm laser to excite the fluorophores through the entire cell . The average intensity of the 564 - nm laser used to excite photoconverted mEOS3 . 2 and mMaple3 for imaging was ∼ 1 . 2 kW / cm 2 . To main - tain an optimal density of photoconverted mEOS3 . 2 or mMaple3 for single molecule localization , the power of the 405 - nm photo - conversion laser was increased every 5 s during data acquisition with a computer - controlled ramp to compensate for irreversible photobleaching of molecules that were photoconverted and im - aged . Single - molecule images were acquired at a frame rate of 200 frames / s for 40 – 60 s from the medial focal plane of a cell with an sCMOS camera ( ORCA - Flash4 . 0 ; Hamamatsu ) using HCimage software ( Hamamatsu ) . Acquired frames were analyzed using a custom sCMOS - specific localization algorithm based on a maximum likelihood estimator ( Huang et al . , 2013 ; Laplante et al . , 2016a , b ) . Localizations were plotted to construct a two - dimensional histogram FPALM image . To aid visualization of the two - dimensional histogram images , the im - ages were convolved with a two - dimensional Gaussian kernel ( σ = 7 . 5 nm ) . Time - lapse images showing dynamics were built by com - bining sequential 200 frame reconstructions ( 1 - s intervals ) and color coded for localization density . To display temporal information in a single composite image , the localizations in each 1 - s time point was assigned a Matlab Jet Color over the lifetime of the patch . We ex - tracted from the Matlab images of individual patches the numbers of localized emitters detected each second overall and from two spatial zones . Dimensions of an immobile mMaple3 - Myo1p patch that is confined the plasma membrane is used as a reference for the membrane proximal zone . Most of the mMaple3 - Myo1p localiza - tions are confined to a region 250 nm wide and 200 nm deep from the cell edge . Localizations that were detected within a 250 - nm - wide and 200 - nm - deep box from the cell edge were classified as membrane proximal zone , and any localizations detected outside the region are defined to be in the membrane distal region . The membrane distal region is limited to 250 nm wide and 350 nm deep starting 200 nm away from the cell edge . Images acquired in each data set ( typically 38 – 40 s at 200 frames / s ) were sum projected , and the boundary of the localizations was identified as the cell edge . The raw time courses were aligned to the time course of a reference patch using the temporal superresolution realignment method ( Berro and Pollard , 2014a ) and averaged to obtain the average time course of localized emitters in the membrane proximal and mem - brane distal regions . The time courses were aligned to the vesicle scission event at time 0 s . To align the data , we first obtained the time courses of the total number of localizations detected in the actin patch ( sum localizations in the membrane proximal region and in the membrane distal regions ) . We then aligned the peak number of localizations detected to the peak number of GFP / YFP molecules assembled in an actin patch reported previously ( Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ; Arasada and Pollard , 2011 ) . To measure the dimensions of the actin patch , a 100 × 100 pixel region with an actin patch was selected , and the coordinates of the localizations for the patch were calculated from the 100 × 100 two - dimensional matrix using Matlab . The patches in all of the figures were oriented with the cell surface at the top with the cell interior below . DIC images acquired prior to FPALM imaging were used to align patches in this coordinate system . To calculate the width of the patch , localization densities in each column of the two - dimensional matrix were summed and projected onto an x - axis . The width of the patch represents the width of the localization density distribution at half the maximum . To calculate the length of the patch , localization Volume 29 February 1 , 2018 Organization of S . pombe a ctin patches | 303 Goode BL , Eskin JA , Wendland B ( 2015 ) .
