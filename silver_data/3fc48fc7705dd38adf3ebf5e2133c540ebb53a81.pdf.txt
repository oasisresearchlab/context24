Kato , 1 , 4 Sidonia Fagarasan 1 † Immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) is essential to maintain the symbiotic balance between gut bacterial communities and the host immune system . Here we provide evidence that the inhibitory co - receptor programmed cell death – 1 ( PD - 1 ) regulates the gut microbiota through appropriate selection of IgA plasma cell repertoires . PD - 1 deficiency generates an excess number of T follicular helper ( T FH ) cells with altered phenotypes , which results in dysregulated selection of IgA precursor cells in the germinal center of Peyer ’ s patches . Consequently , the IgAs produced in PD - 1 – deficient mice have reduced bacteria - binding capacity , which causes alterations of microbial communities in the gut . Thus , PD - 1 plays a critical role in regulation of antibody diversification required for the maintenance of intact mucosal barrier . T he primary function of immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) is to maintain homeostasis at mu - cosal surfaces . Intestinal IgA production occurs via both T helper cell – dependent and in - dependent pathways ( 1 ) . The diversification of IgA repertoire by somatic hypermutation ( SHM ) , however , takes place mostly in specialized mi - croenvironments called germinal centers ( GCs ) , in which B cell interaction with T follicular helper ( T FH ) cells induces the expression of activation - induced cytidine deaminase ( AID ) ( 2 , 3 ) . T FH cells express high amounts of the inhibitory co - receptor programmed cell death – 1 ( PD - 1 ) ( 4 ) . PD - 1 deficiency leads to species - specific , anti - body - mediated autoimmune diseases ( 5 – 7 ) . Note that the incidence of diseases in PD - 1 – deficient mice varies among mouse colonies and depends on AID ( 8 ) . We investigated whether PD - 1 regulates mi - crobial communities and IgA production in the gut . Although the total number of bacteria cultured from the lumen of the small intestine was comparable between PD - 1 – deficient mice ( Pdcd1 – / – ) and wild - type ( WT ) mice ( 4 . 8 × 10 8 and 4 . 7 × 10 8 bacteria per g of intestinal content , respectively ) , Pdcd1 – / – mice had a 93 to 95 % reduction in the number of anaerobic bacteria compared with WT mice ( average 2 . 86 × 10 8 and 0 . 18 × 10 8 in WTand Pdcd1 – / – mice , respective - ly ) ( Fig . 1A ) . The total numbers of “ healthy ” bacteria , such as Bifidobacterium and Bacte - roides ( 9 ) were not detectable or markedly reduced in Pdcd1 – / – mice . In contrast , bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family , which were minor representatives in the WT mice , were increased about 400 - fold in Pdcd1 – / – mice . These results were confirmed by 16 S ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) gene pyrosequencing of cecal contents ( fig . S1A ) . Thus , PD - 1 deficiency perturbs the balance of bacterial communities in the gut . The frequencies and the absolute numbers of IgA - producing cells in the lamina propia ( LP ) were comparable in Pdcd1 – / – and WT mice ( fig . S1 , B , C , and F ) . Flow cytometric analyses of fecal bacteria revealed , however , that the propor - tion of bacteria coated with IgA ( bound IgAs ) was reduced in Pdcd1 – / – mice ( 10 ) ( Fig . 1B ) . In contrast , the concentration of free IgA in in - testinal secretions was higher in Pdcd1 – / – than in WT mice ( Fig . 1C ) . To assess the features of LP IgA , we sequenced the immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IgH ) genes in single sorted IgA - producing cells . Both WT and Pdcd1 – / – mice had a diverse IgA repertoire , yet Pdcd1 – / – mice had an en - richment of IgA - producing cells with the IgH locus belonging to non - V H 1 family genes ( Fig . 1D ) . This difference in the IgA repertoire may be the result of the altered composition of the mi - croflora in Pdcd1 – / – mice . Indeed , as signs of antigen - mediated selection in their IgH genes , about 90 % of the sequences from WT and Pdcd1 – / – mice had mutations and high ratios of replacement ( R ) to silent ( S ) mutations in complementarity - determining region 1 ( CDR1 ) and CDR2 , compared with those in framework regions 1 to 3 ( FWR1 - 3 ) ( fig . S1 , D and E ) . However , the calculated affinity maturation index ( 11 , 12 ) was lower in IgA - producing cells from LP of Pdcd1 – / – mice ( Fig . 1E ) . Together , the re - sults indicate that alterations of IgA compartment in Pdcd1 – / – mice have an impact on symbiotic relations between host and commensal bacteria in the gut . The altered repertoire of the IgA plasma cells in gut could result from changes in the turnover of IgAs at their inductive or residential places . Most of the IgA + B cells are generated in the GCs of Peyer ’ s patches ( PPs ) and arrive at the LP as plasmablasts [ B220 – IgA + MHCII + ( major histocompatibility class II – positive ) , here - after , PBs ] ( 13 ) . In the LP , PBs down - regulate the B cell receptor and MHCII and differentiate into plasma cells ( B220 – IgA + / low MHCII low CD138 + , hereafter , PCs ) ( fig . S1F ) .

Similar to humans , most of the proliferating cells were PBs ( 13 , 15 ) , and the frequency of PBs in the cell cycle was comparable for Pdcd1 – / – mice and WT mice ( fig . S1F ) . We next determined the turnover of IgA - producing cells in LP based on 5 - bromo - 2 ′ - deoxyuridine ( BrdU ) incorporation . Mice were continuously fed BrdU for 10 days , and then BrdU was removed from their drinking water . Ten days after the initiation of BrdU administra - tion , there were significantly more BrdU + PBs in the LP of Pdcd1 – / – mice than in those of WT mice ( Fig . 1F ) . Five days after the removal of BrdU , however , the frequency of BrdU + PBs was reduced by half in Pdcd1 – / – mice , whereas the frequency of BrdU + PBs in WT mice remained unchanged ( Fig . 1F ) . In contrast , the frequency of BrdU - labeled PCs did not differ significantly between Pdcd1 – / – and WT mice ( Fig . 1F ) . The higher turnover of Pdcd1 – / – PBs may be the result of increased apoptosis . Cell death was as - sessed by detection of caspase activation . Com - pared with WT mice , we observed a significant increase in frequency of caspase hi PBs and PCs in the LP of Pdcd1 – / – mice , but this diminished after antibiotic treatment ( Fig . 1G and fig . S1G ) . Together , these results indicate enhanced com - mensal - driven turnover of IgA - producing cells in LP of Pdcd1 – / – mice . Next , we examined the PPs of Pdcd1 – / – mice . Compared with WT mice , Pdcd1 – / – mice had significantly more peanut agglutinin – positive ( PNA + ) Fas + GC B cells and IgA + B cells in PPs ( Fig . 2 , A to C ) . Although we observed a modest increase in the frequency of light - zone B cells in the PP GCs of Pdcd1 – / – mice ( 16 ) ( fig . S2A ) , quantitative real - time fluorescence poly - merase chain reaction analyses of several impor - tant B cell markers for dark - zone and light - zone GC B cells did not show significant differences between Pdcd1 – / – mice and WT mice ( fig . S2B ) . A comparable proportion of IgA + GC cells from Pdcd1 – / – and WT mice were in cell cycle , as assessed by Fucci or a 12 - hour BrdU pulse test ( 17 ) ( fig . S2 , A and C ) . The pulse - chase BrdU experiment revealed considerable differences in dynamics of IgA GCs in Pdcd1 – / – mice , howev - er . Namely , in both Pdcd1 – / – and WT mice , the frequency of GC and IgA + B cells that incor - porated BrdU reached a plateau of 95 and 80 % , respectively , 5 days after the initiation of BrdU labeling ( Fig . 2D ) . However , 5 days after the removal of BrdU , the frequency of labeled GC and IgA + B cells was reduced by half in Pdcd1 – / – mice , whereas most of the BrdU + cells remained in the PPs in WT mice ( Fig . 2D ) . The significant drop in BrdU + cells in PPs of Pdcd1 – / – mice could be the result of increased cell death in situ . However , there were no differences in the fre - quency of caspase hi GCs and IgA + cells for WT and Pdcd1 – / – mice ( fig . S2D ) . The data sug - gest that the increased turnover of IgA + B cells in PPs of Pdcd1 – / – mice may be because they pass through the GCs more rapidly . Also , the increased number of GC B cells in Pdcd1 – / – mice likely results from more inflow of B cells into GCs .

S2 , E and F ) . Taken together , our results suggest that PD - 1 deficiency is associated with an increased import and export of B cells into the GC . Such an abbreviated transit time likely results in im - paired clonal selection and expansion of IgA + B cells in GCs of PPs , as shown by the reduction of thefrequencyof clonallyrelatedIgAsequences [ identical V H - ( N ) - D - ( N ) - J H where V H is the var - iable region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain , Nisarandomnucleotide , Disthediversityregion , andJ H isthejoiningregionoftheimmunoglobulin heavy chain ] in Pdcd1 – / – mice compared with WT mice ( Fig . 2E ) . We then asked why PD - 1 deficiency causes such changes in the dynamics of GC B cells in PPs . It is well established that the number and activation status of T cells — and T FH cells in particular — play a fundamental role in shaping GC biology . In fact , B cells compete for T cell help before entry into GCs , as well as within GCs , and deregulation of T FH cells leads to inap - propriate GC B cell selection and humoral auto - immunity ( 16 – 19 ) . Thus , we assessed T FH cells in the PPs of Pdcd1 – / – mice . The frequency and absolute number of CD4 + T cells , including CXCR5 hi ICOS hi ( high levels of ICOS , protein - inducible costimulator ) T FH cells , were signifi - cantly increased in PPs of Pdcd1 – / – mice ( Fig . 3 , A and B , and Fig . 2A ) . The ratio of T FH to GC B cells in Pdcd1 – / – mice was twice as high as that in WT mice ( Fig . 3C ) . The expression of BCL6 , a transcription factor required for T FH differentiation , was higher in all CD4 + Tcell sub - sets , including the T FH cells in PPs of Pdcd1 – / – mice ( Fig . 3A ) . In contrast , the expression of interferon regulatory factor 4 ( IRF4 ) , which is required for the production of interleukin - 21 ( IL - 21 ) , the cytokine that promotes growth and differentiation of IgA + B cells into PCs ( 19 , 20 ) , was reduced in T FH as well as CXCR5 hi ICOS int cells from Pdcd1 – / – mice . Indeed , T FH cells from Pdcd1 – / – mice produced less IL - 21 compared with those from WT mice , as previously reported ( 21 ) ( Fig . 3 , D and E ) . Furthermore , the propor - tion of T FH cells producing interferon - g ( IFN - g ) was increased in PPs of Pdcd1 – / – mice . In order to better characterize how T FH cells may contribute to the altered GC responses ob - served in Pdcd1 – / – mice , we decided to evalu - ate the ability of PD - 1 – deficient T FH cells to support IgA generation in gut in vivo . Thus , PP CXCR5 hi ICOS hi T FH cells were isolated from Pdcd1 – / – and WT mice and were adoptively transferred into T cell – deficient ( lacking the CD3 e subunit , Cd3e – / – ) mice . Injection of T FH cells from both WT and Pdcd1 – / – mice into Cd3e – / – mice reconstituted the GC B cells and B220 + IgA + B cells in PPs ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . However , Cd3e – / – mice transferred with PD - 1 – deficient T FH cells generated very few IgA - secreting cells in the LP compared with mice injected with WT T FH cells ( Fig . 4 , A to C ) . The few IgAs induced by Pdcd1 – / – T FH cells had increased turnover ( which mirrored the intact Pdcd1 – / – mice ) and a comparable number of mutations in their V H genes and affinity matura - tion index with those induced with the help of WT T FH cells ( Fig . 4 , D and E , and fig . S3A ) . Similar to what we observed in Pdcd1 – / – mice , the absolute number of PP T FH cells was much higher in Cd3e – / – mice that received Pdcd1 – / – T FH cells than in mice injected with WT T FH cells , and the Pdcd1 – / – T FH cells maintained their skewed cytokine profile ( Fig . 4F , and fig . S3 , B and C ) . The results indicate that T FH cells in Pdcd1 – / – mice preclude the generation of IgA - secreting cells in gut . On the other hand , both PD - 1 – deficient and sufficient Foxp3 + T cells , which , as previously reported ( 22 ) , did not ex - pand much but converted into IL - 21 – producing T FH cells in PPs , supported the generation of LP IgAs after the transfer into Cd3e – / – mice ( Fig . 4 , B , C , and F ; and fig . S3 , D and E ) . It was in - teresting that the IgAs induced by Foxp3 + Tcells had significantly fewer mutations and low af - finity maturation compared with those induced upon transfer of T FH cells ( Fig . 4 , D and E ) . These observations suggest that a significant fraction of PCs in Pdcd1 – / – mice may be generated with the help provided by T FH cells derived from Foxp3 + T cells . Taken together , the results indicate that ( i ) the quality of gut IgAs critically depends on the number and the nature of T FH cells in PPs ; ( ii ) PD - 1 deficiency interferes with the selection of B cells in GCs ; and ( iii ) in addition to selection in PP GCs , IgAs appear to undergo a second , commensal - driven selection in the LP . Thus , the LP may serve not only as reservoir of PC but also as a site where proliferating PB are reselected to fit the geographical distribution of dynamic bacterial communities along the intestine . In Pdcd1 – / – mice , as in SHM - defective AID G23S mice ( 23 ) , the gut microbiota induce hyperactivation of the systemic immune sys - tem ( fig . S4 , A and B ) .

On the basis of the data presented here , we propose that the skewed gut microbial communities that result from the dysregulated selection of IgAs drive the expansion of self - reactive B and T cells . Our studies have implications for how modulation of PD - 1 expression promotes toler - ance or uncontrolled immune reactions leading to autoimmunity . References and Notes 1 . S . Fagarasan , S .

Blumberg 1 †‡ Exposure to microbes during early childhood is associated with protection from immune - mediated diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) and asthma . Here , we show that in germ - free ( GF ) mice , invariant natural killer T ( iNKT ) cells accumulate in the colonic lamina propria and lung , resulting in increased morbidity in models of IBD and allergic asthma as compared with that of specific pathogen - free mice . This was associated with increased intestinal and pulmonary expression of the chemokine ligand CXCL16 , which was associated with increased mucosal iNKT cells . Colonization of neonatal — but not adult — GF mice with a conventional microbiota protected the animals from mucosal iNKT accumulation and related pathology . These results indicate that age - sensitive contact with commensal microbes is critical for establishing mucosal iNKT cell tolerance to later environmental exposures . T he mammalian host immune system is broadly stimulated with the first exposure to microorganisms during neonatal life ( 1 ) . The inner surfaces of the gastrointestinal tract and lungs are particularly affected because they are predominant sites of microbial contact ( 2 ) . Ep - idemiologic observations further suggest that the immune effects of early - life microbial exposure are durable and persist into later life because they can be associated with prevention of diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) and asthma ( 3 – 5 ) . Invariant natural killer T ( iNKT ) cells prob - ably play an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis ( UC ) — a major form of IBD — and in asthma ( 6 , 7 ) . Such cells recognize en - dogenous and exogenous lipid antigens presented by the nonpolymorphic major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I – like protein CD1d and secrete abundant amounts of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin - 4 ( IL - 4 ) and IL - 13 upon activation ( 8 , 9 ) . We therefore investigated age - dependent regulation of iNKTcells by use of microbes in mouse models of IBD and asthma . We first examined the appearance of iNKT cells in tissues of 8 - week - old germ - free ( GF ) and specific pathogen - free ( SPF ) Swiss - Webster ( SW ) mice . Relative and absolute numbers of iNKT cells were increased in GF mice in colonic lamina propria ( LP ) ( Fig . 1 , A to C ) . These differences in colonic iNKTcell numbers between GF and SPF mice were detectable after weaning and stable for life , suggesting early and persistent effects of the microbiota ( Fig . 1D ) . iNKT cells were not increased in the ileal LP ( ileum ) of GF mice , and theliver , spleen , andthymuscontainedevenfewer iNKT cells under GF relative to SPF condi - tions ( fig . S1 ) , which is consistent with a recent report ( 10 ) . GF C57BL / 6 mice ( B6 ) exhibited sim - ilar increases of iNKT cells in the colonic LP as well as the liver , in contrast to GF SW mice ( fig . S2 ) . Although increased in number , the iNKT cell expression of several activation and memory markers was unaltered in GF SW , relative to SPF , mice ( fig . S3 ) . To examine the relevance of these findings , we investigated the susceptibility of GF and SPF mice to oxazolone - induced colitis , a model of intestinal inflammation that possesses features of UC and is dependent on IL - 13 production by CD1d - restricted iNKT cells ( 11 , 12 ) . Although GF or germ - reduced mice exhibit exacerbated in - flammation in an innate mouse model of colitis ( 13 , 14 ) , colitis is typically prevented under GF conditions in models dependent on an adaptive immune response ( 15 ) . Surprisingly , GF mice were more sensitive to oxazolone - induced colitis , as revealed by severe weight loss , pathology , and a high mortality rate in contrast to SPF mice ( Fig . 1 , E to H ) . This was not due to overexpression of cell - surface CD1d expression on intestinal epi - thelial ( fig . S4A ) and hematopoietic cells ( fig . S4B ) .
