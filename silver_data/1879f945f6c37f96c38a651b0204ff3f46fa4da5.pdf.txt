Here using 20 cPcdh and HOXD loci as a paradigm , we look into the clustered CTCF TAD 21 boundaries and find that , counterintuitively , outward - oriented CBS elements 22 are crucial for inward enhancer - promoter interactions as well as for gene 23 regulation . Specifically , by combinatorial deletions of a series of putative 24 enhancer elements in vivo or CBS elements in vitro , in conjunction with 25 chromosome conformation capture and RNA - seq analyses , we show that 26 deletions of outward - oriented CBS elements weaken the strength of intraTAD 27 promoter - enhancer interactions and enhancer activation of target genes . Our 28 data highlight the crucial role of outward - oriented CBS elements within the 29 clustered CTCF TAD boundaries and have interesting implications on the 30 organization principles of clustered CTCF sites within TAD boundaries . 31 Key words : CBS orientation , cohesin , CTCF , enhancer , gene regulation , 32 HOXD , Protocadherin , TAD boundary 33 3 / 22 Introduction 34 The interphase genome is organized into highly dynamic structures including 35 chromosome territory , compartment , topologically associated domain ( TAD ) , 36 and chromatin loop 1 . CTCF ( CCCTC - binding factor ) is a key architecture 37 protein for interphase 3D genome organization and CBS ( CTCF binding site ) 38 elements throughout the mammalian genome function as insulators to block 39 aberrant enhancer activation and ensure proper gene expression or to mark the 40 boundaries between euchromatin and heterochromatin 2 - 4 . A prevailing model 41 for interphase chromosome folding , known as loop extrusion , posits that 42 cohesin complex extrudes chromatin fibers bidirectionally into expanding loops 43 until blocked asymmetrically by orientated CBS elements 5 - 7 . This model 44 explains TAD formation and is consistent with the observations that the two 45 flanking boundaries of each TAD are associated with mostly convergent 46 forward - reverse CBS elements 8 , 9 . However , it is puzzling that most TAD 47 boundaries contain clustered CBS elements with complex orientations of both 48 convergence and divergence . 49 TAD boundaries emerged as insulator elements that restrain interTAD 50 chromatin interactions . Their dysfunction leads to abnormal development and 51 progressive oncogenesis 10 - 12 . Mammalian clustered CTCF TAD boundaries are 52 more evolutionarily conserved than other genomic regions 13 - 15 . Higher 53 insulation scores of TAD boundaries are associated with rich CTCF 54 enrichments and clustered enhancers known as super - enhancers tend to be 55 insulated by strong boundaries 16 , 17 . Divergent CBS elements are enriched at 56 TAD boundaries ; however , a divergent orientation signature is not strictly 57 required for effective insulation . For example , the characteristics of specific 58 CBS elements can outweigh CBS number and orientation 18 . Finally , insulation 59 potency depends on the local context of CBS elements and robustness of 60 enhancer - promoter communications can bypass CTCF insulation regardless of 61 the intervening CBS strength 19 - 22 . 62 4 / 22 As a paradigm for investigating mechanisms of 3D genome folding , the 63 mouse clustered protocadherins ( cPcdh ) comprise three sequential gene 64 clusters , Pcdh  ,  , and  , encoding 58 isoforms , spanning ~ 1 million bps ( Fig . 65 1a ) 23 . The Pcdh  and  clusters consist of 14 and 22 variable first exons , 66 respectively , each of which is cis - spliced to single sets of three downstream 67 constant exons ; whereas the Pcdh  cluster consists of 22 single exons (  1 -  22 ) 68 with no constant exon . The cPcdh promoter choice is determined by 69 CTCF / cohesin - mediated long - range enhancer - promoter looping interactions 70 anchored by convergent CBS elements 9 , 24 , 25 . Their combinatorial expression 71 patterns in single neurons generate enormous cell - surface molecular diversity 72 for assembling enormous networks of neuronal connectivity 26 , 27 . In addition , 73 precise expression patterns of members of the HoxD gene cluster are central 74 for limb development 28 , 29 . Here , using cPcdh and HOXD as model genes , we 75 find that outward - oriented CBS elements within clustered CTCF boundaries are 76 crucial for intraTAD promoter - enhancer interactions and gene regulation . Our 77 data shed interesting lights on the organization principles of the clustered CTCF 78 TAD boundaries . 79 Results 80 The downstream boundary of cPcdh superTAD comprises a cluster of 81 CTCF sites with mixed orientations 82 During mouse neocortical development , the 58 cPcdh genes are organized into 83 a large megabase - sized superTAD comprised of the Pcdh  and Pcdh  TADs 84 ( Fig . 1a ; Supplementary Fig . 1a - c ) 9 , 30 . At the telomeric boundary of the cPcdh 85 superTAD , there is a complex array of CTCF sites or CBS elements ( CBSa - h , 86 Fig . 1a - c ) . Among these eight CBS elements , CBSa - e , CBSg , and CBSh are in 87 the reverse orientation ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ) . By contrast , a single CBSf is 88 in the forward orientation ( Supplementary Fig . 1e ) . We performed chromatin 89 immunoprecipitation followed by high - throughput sequencing ( ChIP - seq ) 90 5 / 22 experiments with a specific antibody against CTCF using microdissected 91 mouse neocortical tissues and found that CTCF is enriched at these elements 92 ( Fig . 1c ) . Interestingly , the CBS b and c elements form a single peak and CBS 93 f and g elements form a single peak ( Fig . 1c ) . To see whether these elements 94 are anchors of cohesin loop extrusion , we performed ChIP - seq experiments 95 with a specific antibody against Rad21 , a subunit of cohesin , and found that 96 cohesin is co - localized with CTCF at all of these CBS elements , suggesting that 97 cohesin loop extrusion from this boundary may regulate cPcdh gene expression 98 ( Fig . 1b , c ) . 99 We first comprehensively mapped expression patterns of each member of 100 the three Pcdh gene clusters at a series of 12 developmental stages by 101 collecting embryos every other day and new pubs every other two days . RNA - 102 seq of microdissected neocortical tissues showed that each member of the 103 cPcdh genes is expressed dynamically and that the cPcdh genes are most 104 abundantly expressed at the newborn stage ( Extended Data Fig . 1 ) . Thus , we 105 used the newborn mouse neocortical tissues in the following gene regulation 106 studies . 107 Within the Pcdh  TAD , members of the Pcdh  cluster are activated by 108 HS5 - 1 and HS7 ( Fig . 1b and Extended Data Fig . 2a , b ) 24 , 31 , 32 . However , how 109 members of the Pcdh  clusters are regulated within the Pcdh  TAD is not 110 clear . To this end , we profiled the chromatin regulatory landscape by assaying 111 for transposase - accessible chromatin with high - throughput sequencing ( ATAC - 112 seq ) and identified six highly accessible regions at the telomeric boundary of 113 the Pcdh  TAD , corresponding to the previously identified DNaseI 114 hypersensitive sites of HS7L , HS5 - 1aL , HS5 - 1bL , HS18 , HS19 - 20 , and HS21 115 ( Fig . 1c and Extended Data Fig . 2c , d ) 24 , 33 . Finally , we performed H3K27ac and 116 H3K4me1 ChIP - seq and found , except the last one ( HS21 ) , all of the other five 117 clustered HS elements are marked by H3K27ac and H3K4me1 , suggesting that 118 they form a super - enhancer for members of the Pcdh  gene clusters ( Fig . 1c ) . 119 6 / 22 The Pcdh  TAD boundary comprises a super - enhancer 120 We dissected the putative enhancers in mice in vivo by CRISPR / Cas9 - based 121 DNA - fragment editing system ( Extended Data Fig . 3a - c ) 9 to test their 122 functionality . We first deleted the HS7L element ( Extended Data Fig . 3b , c ) and 123 found , surprisingly , it does not lead to decreased levels of cPcdh gene 124 expression in neocortical and olfactory tissues ( Fig . 1d , Extended Data Fig . 3e - 125 g , and Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . Because HS5 - 1aL is in the Pcdh  constant 126 coding region and its deletion will destroy the transcript integration , we mutated 127 the CBSa element within HS5 - 1aL by homologous recombination using 128 CRISPR with an ssODN donor . We found that CBSa mutation abolished CTCF 129 enrichments ( Extended Data Fig . 3d ) . Interestingly , it only results in a moderate 130 decrease of expression levels of members of the Pcdh  , but not  , clusters 131 ( Fig . 1e , Extended Data Fig . 3e , and Supplementary Fig . 2b ) , suggesting a 132 limited role of CBSa in tethering HS5 - 1aL to Pcdh  . 133 We next deleted the entire region covering all of the other three putative 134 enhancers ( from HS5 - 1bL to HS19 - 20 ) and found that , in contrast to HS7 and 135 HS5 - 1aL , this large deletion leads to a significant decrease of levels of Pcdh  136 gene expression , suggesting that enhancers for members of Pcdh  clusters 137 reside in this region ( Fig . 1f and Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . We then dissected this 138 region in great details and found that deletion of the large DNA fragment 139 covering both HS5 - 1bL and HS18 results in a significant decrease of levels of 140 Pcdh  gene expression ( Fig . 1g and Supplementary Fig . 2d ) . In addition , 141 deletion of the DNA fragment covering both HS18 and HS19 - 20 also results in 142 a significant decrease of levels of Pcdh  gene expression ( Fig . 1h and 143 Supplementary Fig . 2e ) . 144 Finally , we deleted each of these three elements individually and found that , 145 surprisingly , deletion of HS5 - 1bL has no effect on Pcdh  gene expression ( Fig . 146 1i and Supplementary Fig . 2f ) . By contrast , deletion of either HS18 or HS19 - 20 147 result in a significant decrease of levels of Pcdh  gene expression ( Fig . 1j , k 148 7 / 22 and Supplementary Fig . 2g , h ) . These data suggest that these two H3K27ac - 149 enriched elements play a leading role in activating Pcdh  genes in vivo in the 150 mouse brain . Consistently , 4C experiments revealed close contacts between 151 Pcdh  and HS18 - 20 ( Extended Data Fig . 4a , b ) . Unlike HS5 - 1 , which is brain - 152 specific , HS18 - 20 are enriched with H3K27ac and H3K4me3 marks in multiple 153 tissues ( Extended Data Fig . 4c , d ) , explaining why members of the Pcdh  gene 154 clusters are expressed in both neural and non - neural tissues . Taken together , 155 these data suggest that the Pcdh  downstream TAD boundary is a super - 156 enhancer comprising a cluster of enhancers among which HS18 and HS19 - 20 157 are the most important . 158 HS5 - 1bL is a Pcdh  c3 - specific insulator 159 Pcdh  c3 is the most abundantly expressed isoform in the mouse neocortex and 160 has a unique role in dendrite arborization ( Extended Data Fig . 1e ) 34 . However , 161 the underlying mechanism remains unclear . To this end , we performed 4C 162 experiments and found that Pcdh  c3 is in close contacts with HS5 - 1bL , HS18 , 163 and HS19 - 20 ( Fig . 2a ) . Consistently , deletion of HS18 and / or HS19 - 20 results 164 in a significant decrease of levels of Pcdh  c3 gene expression , suggesting that 165 HS18 and HS19 - 20 are enhancers for Pcdh  c3 ( Fig . 2b - d ) . Surprisingly , 166 deletion of HS5 - 1bL leads to a significant increase of levels of Pcdh  c3 , but not 167  c4 or  c5 , gene expression ( Fig . 2e ) , suggesting that HS5 - 1bL is a putative 168 insulator to specifically block the activation of Pcdh  c3 by the HS18 and HS19 - 169 20 enhancers . To this end , we performed 4C experiments with Pcdh  c3 as an 170 anchor using neocortical tissues of the HS5 - 1bL deleted mice and found a 171 significant increase of long - distance chromatin interactions between Pcdh  c3 172 and HS18 - 20 ( Fig . 2f ) . To confirm this aberrantly increased chromatin contacts 173 upon deletion of HS5 - 1bL , we performed 4C with HS19 - 20 as an anchor and 174 indeed observed increased chromatin contacts with Pcdh  c3 ( Fig . 2g ) . In 175 conjunction with no expression increase of all of the other members of the 176 8 / 22 Pcdh  gene clusters upon deletion of HS5 - 1bL ( Fig . 1i ) , we conclude that HS5 - 177 1bL is a  c3 - specific insulator . 178 cPcdhs are expressed from H3K9me3 - enriched facultative 179 heterochromatins of superTAD 180 We next mapped the chromatin landscape of a wide variety of histone 181 modifications in the cPcdh superTAD and found that this region is enriched for 182 both repressive marks of H3K9me3 and active marks of H3K36me3 ( Fig . 3a ) , 183 suggesting that cPcdhs are expressed from facultative heterochromatin region 184 of the superTAD . In addition , expression of each member of the three Pcdh 185 gene clusters is strongly correlated with active marks of H3K4me3 and H3K9ac 186 ( Fig . 3b and Supplementary Figs . 3 , 4 ) . Moreover , this region is also marked by 187 the repressive histone marks of H3K9me2 in the mouse neocortex ( Fig . 3c and 188 Extended Data Fig . 5 ) . Specifically , the coding region of each member of the 189 Pcdh clusters is correlated with a peak of H3K9me2 ( Extended Data Fig . 5 ) but 190 not H3K9me3 ( Extended Data Fig . 6 ) . To further investigate mechanisms of 191 cPcdh gene expression , we performed methylated DNA immunoprecipitation 192 sequencing ( MeDIP - seq ) experiments and found that each member of the 193 H3K9me3 - enriched cPcdhs is hypermethylated on the body of each variable 194 exon ( Fig . 3c , Extended Data Fig . 7a - d ) . We noted that Pcdh  1 differs from 195 other cPcdh members in that its DNA - methylation peak is much closer to the 196 transcription start site ( Extended Data Fig . 7e ) , explaining why it is silenced in 197 the mouse neocortex ( Fig . 3b ) . 198 Outward - oriented CBSf is the key boundary CTCF site 199 All of the HS5 - 1aL , HS5 - 1bL , HS18 , and HS19 - 20 enhancers contain reverse - 200 oriented CBS elements ( CBSa - e , Fig . 1c ) that are enriched for cohesin and are 201 in close contacts with the forward - oriented CBS elements of the Pcdh  202 promoters via CTCF / cohesin - mediated chromatin loops . In addition , there are 203 9 / 22 two more reverse - oriented CBS elements , CBSg and CBSh , located 204 immediately downstream of this super - enhancer . However , there is a single 205 forward - oriented CBSf element located between the super - enhancer and the 206 two reverse - oriented CBS g and h elements ( Fig . 4a ) . To this end , we 207 generated a CBSf - deletion mouse line ( Fig . 4a and Extended Data 8a ) and 208 confirmed the abolishment of CTCF and cohesin enrichments at the location of 209 CBSf but not CBSg ( Fig . 4a , b ) . 210 Remarkably , deletion of the forward - oriented CBSf element results in a 211 significant decrease of expression levels of members of the Pcdh  gene 212 clusters ( Fig . 4c and Supplementary Fig . 5a ) , demonstrating that the single 213 forward - oriented CBSf plays a crucial role in the regulation of Pcdh  gene 214 expression . To investigate the underlying mechanism , we performed a series 215 of chromatin conformation capture experiments with members of the Pcdh  216 gene clusters as anchors and found a significant decrease of long - distance 217 chromatin contacts between the super - enhancer and members of the Pcdh  218 gene clusters ( Fig . 4d ) . Finally , we observed a significant increase of long - 219 distance chromatin contacts with CBSh with a sharp edge at the location of 220 CBSf ( Fig . 4e ) . To confirm this , we performed reciprocal capture experiments 221 with CBSh as an anchor and observed a significant increase of long - distance 222 chromatin contacts with members of the Pcdh  gene clusters ( Extended Data 223 Fig . 8b ) . Finally , combined deletion of both CBSf and CBSg elements 224 ( Extended Data Fig . 8c ) results in a similar phenotype ( Extended Data Figs . 225 8d , 9 and Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . Taken together , we conclude that a single 226 outward - oriented CBSf element within the clustered CTCF TAD boundary plays 227 a key role in Pcdh  gene regulation . 228 Outward - oriented CBS elements within a clustered CTCF TAD boundary 229 are crucial for HOXD13 expression 230 10 / 22 To see whether it is a general phenomenon for a key role of the outward - 231 oriented boundary CBS element in gene regulation , we investigated the HOXD 232 left boundary , which has a complex array of six conserved clustered CBS 233 elements ( CBS1 - 6 , Supplementary Fig . 6a - d ) , of the human centromeric TAD 234 ( C - DOM ) ( Fig . 5a - b ) 28 , 29 . The human HOXD locus is located at the right 235 boundary of the C - DOM ( Extended Data Fig . 10a , b ) . It contains nine HOXD 236 genes , of which only HOXD13 is associated a cluster of reverse - oriented CBS 237 elements ( CBS8 - 12 ) . By contrast , HOXD8 and HOXD9 have two forward - 238 oriented CBS elements ( CBS13 , 14 ) and HOXD10 - 12 and HOXD1 - 4 have no 239 CBS element ( Figs . 5a - c and Supplementary Fig . 6a ) . We performed Hi - C and 240 found that there are strong long - distance chromatin interactions between the 241 human HOXD13 and the C - DOM left boundary , consistent with the convergent 242 rule of forward - reverse CBS elements ( Extended Data Fig . 10a , b ) . Interestingly , 243 within the left boundary , there are two outward - oriented CBS elements ( CBS3 244 and CBS5 , Fig . 5b and Supplementary Fig . 6b ) . 245 We screened single - cell clones for deletion of both CBS3 and CBS5 246 elements and obtained three homozygous double - knockout cell clones 247 (  CBS3 + 5 , Supplementary Fig . 6e ) . We first confirmed the loss of CTCF 248 enrichments at both CBS3 and CBS5 ( Fig . 5a , b ) . We then performed 4C with 249 HOXD13 as an anchor and found that there is a significant increase of 250 chromatin interactions with the left boundary upon deletions of the two outward - 251 oriented CBS elements ( Fig . 5d ) . This increased chromatin interactions were 252 confirmed by reciprocal 4C experiments with CBS2 or CBS4 as an anchor ( Fig . 253 5e , f ) . By contrast , there is a significant decrease of chromatin interactions with 254 proximal sequences ( Fig . 5d ) . Finally , we performed RNA - seq experiments and 255 found that deletion of outward - oriented CBS elements results in a significant 256 decrease of expression levels of HOXD13 but not HOXD12 - 1 , indicating that 257 the two outward - oriented CBS elements play a key role in HOXD13 gene 258 regulation ( Fig . 5g and Supplementary Fig . 6f ) . 259 11 / 22 Discussion 260 The enormous connectivity of billions of neurons are intricately related to the 261 precise cell - specific expression patterns of cPcdh genes in the brain . 262 Specifically , the isoform - promiscuous cis hetero - dimerization and isoform - 263 specific trans homo - dimerization of combinatorially expressed cPcdhs mediate 264 cell - specific recognition between neurons , resulting in the ingenious dendrite 265 self - avoidance and axonal coexistence 27 , 35 - 42 . Intriguingly , chromatin 266 establishes a stable cPcdh expression pattern for single neurons in the brain 267 during human fetal development 43 . In addition , the proper spatiotemporal 268 expression of the HoxD genes is central for limb development 29 , 44 . Here , we 269 first comprehensively mapped cPcdh expression patterns in the neocortex 270 during mouse brain development . We then dissected , through sequential and 271 combinatorial deletion of candidate enhancer elements , how cPcdhs are 272 regulated by a downstream clustered CTCF boundary super - enhancer . In 273 addition , we further deleted outward - oriented CBS elements within clustered 274 CTCF TAD boundaries of the cPcdh and HOXD loci . In conjunction with 275 chromosome conformation and gene expression analyses , we found that 276 outward - oriented CBS elements are crucial for intraTAD promoter - enhancer 277 interactions and proper gene regulation ( Fig . 5h ) . 278 The characteristics of the clustered CTCF TAD boundaries and their exact 279 nature of insulation activities are under intense investigation 13 , 18 , 20 , 22 , 29 , 44 - 48 . The 280 CBS elements within a clustered CTCF TAD boundary between Pax3 and its 281 distal enhancer cooperate redundantly for robust insulation in a largely 282 orientation - independent manner 18 . In addition , various combinations of 283 clustered CBS elements in distinct orientations could function as functional 284 insulators when inserted between distal enhancers and their target 285 promoters 20 , 22 , 49 . Moreover , the CBS elements within a clustered CTCF TAD 286 boundary located between the C - DOM and T - DOM ( telomeric domain ) of HoxD 287 have various functions for controlling its spatiotemporal gene expression 288 12 / 22 patterns during limb development 29 , 44 . Here we show that the outward - oriented 289 CBS elements of the left boundary of C - DOM are crucial for maintaining 290 HOXD13 gene expression ( Fig . 5 ) . Finally , consistent with the crucial role of 291 outward - oriented CBS elements , an inversion leading to increased numbers of 292 outward - oriented CBS elements within a clustered CTCF TAD boundary results 293 in enhanced insulation activity and altered gene expression 50 . 294 CTCF plays a key role in the formation of insulation at TAD boundaries , 295 where in many cases multiple CBS elements are arranged in a clustered array 296 with complex orientations , such as the telomeric boundary of the Pcdh  TAD 297 and the centromeric boundary of the C - TOM at the HOXD cluster . According to 298 the convergent rule , the inward - oriented CBS elements within the clustered 299 CTCF TAD boundaries are essential for intraTAD chromatin interactions 8 , 9 . 300 Thus , chromatin contacts such as long - distance enhancer - promoter 301 interactions primarily occur within the TADs 51 , 52 . However , recent studies 302 provide increasing evidence for interTAD communications between 303 neighboring TADs 50 . Although TADs are likely a statistical model from 304 population cells , there is clear evidence of clustering of CBS elements at TAD 305 boundaries 13 , 15 , 48 . On one hand , the outward - oriented CBS elements could be 306 crucial for intraTAD chromatin interactions . On the other hand , the outward - 307 oriented CBS elements function as crucial insulators blocking aberrant 308 chromatin interactions from neighboring TADs as we observed a sharp edge 309 for increased outward chromatin interactions ( Fig . 4 ) . 310 The structure of TADs and loops is closely related to gene expression . 311 Their formation is thought to be resulted from CTCF - anchored active cohesin 312 “loop extrusion” . Specifically , cohesin extruded loops anchored between 313 convergent forward - reverse CBS elements can enhance or stabilize enhancer - 314 promoter spatial contacts , which may or may not activate gene expression 53 - 56 . 315 In addition , both the spatial and linear distances between distal enhancers and 316 target promoters could be crucial for gene regulation 57 - 59 . Our study on Pcdh  c3 317 13 / 22 regulation is consistent with this idea . Pcdh  c3 , the most abundantly expressed 318 cPcdh isoform in the mouse neocortex ( Extended Data Fig . 1e ) , plays a crucial 319 role in dendrite arborization 34 . It is puzzling why HS5 - 1bL deletion leads to a 320 significant increase of expression levels of only  c3 but not other members of 321 cPcdh genes ( Figs . 1i , 2e and Extended Data Fig . 3e ) . It has been shown that 322 gene activation is not only dependent on promoter associated CBS elements , 323 but also on the density of enhancers in the genomic context 32 , 57 . Consistently , 324 only  c3 , but not  c4 and  c5 , is associated with two forward - oriented CBS 325 elements ( Fig . 2a ) despite the fact that , compared with other members of 326 Pcdh  clusters , all of the three Pcdh  c genes are located close to the 327 downstream distal enhancers of HS18 - 20 which contain two reverse - oriented 328 CBS elements ( Fig . 1b ) . A “double clamp” interaction mechanism of the two 329 forward - reverse CBS pairs , similar to the activation of members of the Pcdh  330 gene cluster , may be utilized to activate  c3 . This explains why only  c3 , but not 331  c4 and  c5 , expression levels are enhanced upon deletion of the HS5 - 1bL 332 ( CBSbc ) insulator . 333 Our data highlight a significant role of the outward - oriented CBS elements 334 in providing insulation for restraining aberrant interTAD interactions and 335 maintain proper intraTAD promoter - enhancer interactions and gene expression . 336 HOXD13 showed strong interactions with two H3K27ac - marked regions of 337 LNPK and GT2 . We observed a significant decrease of chromatin interactions 338 with LNPK and GT2 upon removal of outward - oriented CBS elements ( Fig . 5d ) , 339 explaining the decreased levels of HOXD13 gene expression . This suggests 340 that the outward - oriented CBS boundary elements of the C - TOM may ensure 341 proper interactions with LNPK and GT2 for precise control of HOXD13 342 expression patterns . 343 We observed that H3K9me3 marks correlate with the monoallelic cPcdh 344 gene expression and that H3K9me2 marks correlate with both monoallelic and 345 biallelic cPcdh gene expression 26 . The correlation between H3K9me3 346 14 / 22 enrichments and DNA methylation levels in both monoallelic and biallelic cPcdh 347 genes may be coordinated by UHRF1 60 . Interestingly , almost every members 348 of the cPcdh genes is marked by both repressive ( H3K9me3 and H3K9me2 ) 349 and active ( H3K36me3 ) marks ( Fig . 3 ) , suggestive of a facultative 350 heterochromatic state related to monoallelic cPcdh gene expression . Whether 351 the overlap of H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 is resulted from allelic differences of 352 the epigenome and / or admixtures of distinct subpopulation cells awaits further 353 exploration . 354 15 / 22 Acknowledgements 355 We are grateful for technical supports from Leyang Wang , Mo Zhang , and 356 Jingwei Li .

The mouse Pcdh  ,  , and  gene clusters are closely - 501 linked within the cPcdh superTAD , which is divided into two TADs of Pcdh  and 502 Pcdh  . Pcdh  and  gene clusters contain 14 and 22 variable first exons , 503 respectively , each of which is alternatively spliced to a single set of three 504 downstream constant exons . The Pcdh  gene cluster contains 22 variable 505 exons but with no constant exon . Two Pcdh  enhancers , HS5 - 1 and HS7 , are 506 indicated by black arrows . b , ChIP - seq of CTCF , Rad21 , H3K27ac , and 507 H3K4me1 as well as ATAC - seq profiles of the cPcdh locus in the mouse 508 neocortex . Arrowheads indicate CBS elements with orientations . Within the 509 Pcdh  TAD , each Pcdh  alternate promoter is flanked by two forward CBS 510 elements , the downstream enhancer of HS5 - 1 is flanked by two reverse CBS 511 elements . Within the Pcdh  TAD , each Pcdh  or  promoter is associated with 512 one forward CBS , except for  ,  c4 , and  c5 which have no CBS , as well as 513  c3 which has two forward CBS elements . c , Close - up of the cPcdh superTAD 514 downstream boundary marked by a red dotted rectangle in a and b . The 515 boundary comprises eight CBS elements , of which only CBSf is in the reverse 516 orientation , and six ATAC - seq peaks , of which HS7L , HS5 - 1bL , HS18 , and 517 HS19 - 20 are knocked out individually or in combinations in mice .

Note a sharp edge for the 559 transition from decrease to increase at the location of CBSf . Differences (  CBSf 560 versus WT ) are shown under the 4C profiles . 561 Fig . 5 | Double knockout of outward - oriented CBS3 and CBS5 562 downregulates HOXD13 . a , CTCF and H3K27ac ChIP - seq profiles of the 563 HOXD centromeric regulatory TAD ( C - DOM ) in wild - type ( WT ) and in CBS3 564 and CBS5 double knockout (  CBS3 + 5 ) homozygous single - cell clones .

The outward oriented CBS 584 elements function as an important barrier to ensure productive intraTAD 585 promoter - centered contacts . Loss of outward oriented CBS elements results in 586 aberrant interTAD promoter - anchored chromatin interactions , leading to 587 decreased gene expression . 588 F PK M F PK M F PK M F PK M F P K M F P K M F PK M F PK M a 0 5 10 15 20 W T ∆ HS5 -
