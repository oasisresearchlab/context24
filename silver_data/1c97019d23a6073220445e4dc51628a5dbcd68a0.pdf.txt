Here we report that SV40 also utilizes cell surface integrins to activate signaling networks required for infection , even in the absence of the previously implicated glycosphingolipids . We identify ILK , PDK1 , the RhoGAP GRAF1 and RhoA as core nodes of the signaling network activated upon SV40 engagement of integrins . We show that integrin - mediated signaling through host SV40 engagement induces the de - phosphorylation of Ezrin leading to uncoupling of the plasma membrane and cortical actin . Our results provide functional evidence for a mechanism by which SV40 activates signal transduction in human epithelial cells via integrins in the context of clathrin - independent endocytosis .

The virus , a DNA non - enveloped member of the polyoma family , binds the glycosphin - golipid GM1 as receptor ; SV40 virions attach to several GM1 molecules in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and are immobilized by the cortical actin cytoskeleton . SV40 uses multiple clathrin - independent endocytic routes , including caveolae , to achieve successful infectious entry [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] . Uptake of the virus in its host CV1 cells involves activation of a phosphorylation - dependent signaling cascade and local rearrangements of the cortical actin cytoskeleton : filamentous actin is disassembled , followed by recruitment of actin and dynamin II to the cytosolic surface of the caveolae [ 5 ] . Moreover , the virus triggers an increase in caveolae dynamics at the cell surface , which promotes exchange between the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic pools of caveolin - 1 , an effect , which can be mimicked by actin depoly - merization [ 5 – 7 ] . Recently , SV40 binding to GM1 was shown to induce membrane curvature that leads to the formation of deep invaginations and tubules , important for successful infection [ 8 ] . Furthermore , SV40 infection in cultured HeLa cells was dependent on genes encoding kinases involved in focal adhesion assembly and turnover , and in cell adhesion signaling [ 9 ] . A major undefined aspect of this endocytic uptake route is how it is activated by cargo . There is currently very little knowledge about the molecular identity of the signals that are induced , how these are transduced and regulated , and how this is coupled to downstream effects on the actin cytoskeleton . To address this we took a two - step approach , using first proteomic technology that would allow for the identification and quantification of cell surface glycoproteins upon virus perturba - tion , followed by silencing a set of genes , selected and guided by the previous screen , by siRNA in the A431 human epithelial cell line . In this cell line , SV40 infection requires caveolin - 1 ( Cav1 ) ( see below ) . Cell biological characterization of the identified genes led us to discover that SV40 requires integrins to efficiently bind to cells . Dependent on both integrins and cholesterol , SV40 induces the phosphorylation of PKB / AKT via the activation of PI3K ( phosphatidyl inositol 3 9 - kinase ) and PDK1 ( 3 9 - phosphoinositide - dependent kinase 1 ) . Via this signaling cascade , SV40 stimulates the Rho GTPase Activating Protein ( GAP ) GRAF1 to promote the inactivation of RhoA . This , in turn , leads to a loss of phosphorylated Ezrin , resulting in a detachment of the cortical actin cytoskeleton from the plasma membrane , a prerequisite for successful SV40 infection . Because SV40 infection requires Cav1 while the signal transduction induced by SV40 depends on GRAF1 , our results reveal a molecular circuitry that combines the PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e55799 involvement of two proteins associated with different clathrin - independent endocytic activities . Results Chemoproteomic Screen Reveals Modulated Plasma Membrane Glycoproteins upon SV40 Entry To obtain a cell surface subproteome view ( ‘‘surfaceome’’ ) and to screen for potential changes upon SV40 entry , we used the chemoproteomic Cell Surface Capturing ( CSC ) technology in combination with quantitative SILAC - based relative quantitative proteomic workflows [ 10 , 11 ] . CSC technology allows for the capturing and subsequent identification of the N - glycosylated surfaceome . Human A431 cells were treated with an infectious SV40 virus stock for 30 min and changes in the surfaceome were monitored in comparison to the uninfected control cells . As a second control , and to detect specific changes during SV40 entry , we performed the same experiment with Vesicular Stomatitis Virus ( VSV ) . These CSC experiments revealed the detectable SV40 - modulated A431 surfaceome including , for example , epithelial cell adhesion molecules ( EPCAM , CD97 ) , members of the immunoglobulin superfamily ( CD58 , CD276 , EMB , AL - CAM ) , solute carrier proteins ( SLC3A2 , SLCO3A1 , SLC4A7 ) , and immune response proteins ( Interleukin 17A receptor ) ( Table S1 ) . Among the SV40 - modulated proteins we detected and focused on a group of adhesion glycoproteins ( Figure 1 ) . Specif - ically , we observed an increased abundance of six different integrins ( ITGA2 , ITGA3 , ITGA6 , ITGB1 , ITGB4 and ITGB6 ) on the cell surface upon 30 min exposure to SV40 . These results suggest that either during binding of SV40 to the cell , or during viral entry , SV40 induces a cellular response that leads to a direct , or indirect abundance change of the detected set of glycosylated cell surface adhesion molecules . RNAi Screen and Epistasis Analysis of Cell Adhesion Components in SV40 Infection To address whether the observed surfaceome changes have direct functional relevance for SV40 infection , we undertook a candidate - based siRNA screen in A431 cells . For this second screen we generated a gene list based on the following criteria : a ) the results of the chemoproteomic screen ( first screen ) where 11 % of the total hits were found to be integrins , b ) literature searching for integrin - interacting proteins and cell adhesion molecules , c ) extending the STRING network outcome of the molecules above by one or two interactors , and d ) including the Rho and Rab GTPase family of signaling proteins , known to regulate SV40 endocytic uptake . A total of 263 genes , transembrane and structural components , cytoplasmic and signaling molecules of cell adhesion downstream of integrin signaling were compiled ( Table S2 ) . These were silenced with 4 individual siRNAs and the effect on SV40 infection was determined with automated microscopy and computerized image analysis . Genes for which at least 2 out of 4 siRNAs significantly changed SV40 infection are listed in a table ( Figure 2A ) . As expected , this secondary screen revealed the caveolae scaffold protein caveolin - 1 ( as well as caveolin - 3 ) , but also the RhoA GTPase Activating Protein and BAR - domain containing protein ARHGAP26 or GRAF1 , known to induce membrane tubulation in clathrin - and caveolin - independent endocytosis [ 12 , 13 ] . Dynamin 1 ( DNM1 ) was also found in this group , consistent with a role for Dynamin in SV40 endocytosis [ 5 ] . DNM1 , although considered a neuronal dynamin isoform , is expressed in cancer - derived cell lines [ 14 ] . Within the set of genes that increased SV40 infection upon silencing we found Ezrin ( EZRIN ) , a highly expressed protein that establishes a tight coupling between the cytosolic surface of the plasma membrane and the underlying cortical actin cytoskeleton [ 15 , 16 ] . To test genetically whether these proteins might functionally interact , we performed various combinations of double siRNA knockdown . Silencing both Cav1 and GRAF1 did not lead to further inhibition of SV40 infection ( Figure 2B ) , suggesting that these two proteins do not support two parallel pathways of infection . However , we found that loss of GRAF1 , but not loss of Cav1 , could be efficiently rescued by silencing Ezrin ( Figure 2B ) . This suggests an epistatic relationship in A431 cells where Ezrin lies downstream of GRAF1 in caveolin - dependent SV40 infectious entry . Integrins are Required for SV40 Binding and are Essential for Infection To understand how this epistatic relationship might work , we looked for further hints in our screen . We noticed that six integrins were amongst the identified components . Integrins a 2 and b 1 showed a very potent effect , by strongly reducing SV40 infection upon siRNA - mediated silencing ( Figure 2A , C ) . To interfere with integrin function by other means , we used a blocking antibody against a 2 b 1 integrin . Such antibodies have been used to block ligand binding and the functional activity of integrins [ 17 – 19 ] . Pre - exposing cells to this antibody completely blocked SV40 infection ( Figure 2C ) . When we visualized a 2 b 1 integrins on the cell surface , we observed that in cells that were incubated with SV40 , distinct patches of integrins appeared on ruffle - like extensions of the plasma membrane within the first 5 min of virus incubation . This localization persisted for about one hour , after which it disappeared ( Figure S1A , and data not shown ) . We next performed an assay to determine the binding capacity of SV40 in cells silenced for integrins . a 2 b 1 integrin knockdown compromised SV40 binding to A431 cells , as quantified by western blots against the major capsid protein of SV40 , VP1 ( Figure 2D ) . Because literature suggests that integrins might be important to establish levels of GM1 on the cell surface [ 20 , 21 ] , and GM1 is currently believed to be the sole attachment factor of SV40 [ 4 , 22 ] , we performed the same experiment in GM95 mouse cells , which are deficient in all glycosphingolipids [ 23 ] . Remarkably , we observed that SV40 binds quite efficiently to GM95 cells ( Figure 2E , Figure S1B ) , similar to binding in A431 and HeLa cells , although less efficiently than in CV1 cells , which are derived from the natural host of SV40 , Green African Monkey . Similar observations were made with recombinant virus - like particles consisting of the outer capsid protein VP1 , produced in insect cells [ 24 ] ( Figure 2F ) . This indicates that binding of SV40 to GM95 cells is not mediated by a co - purifying contaminant from CV1 cells used to propagate SV40 . External loading of GM95 cells with GM1 did however increase the SV40 binding capacity of GM95 cells ( Figure 2E ) , and restored infection in GM95 cells ( Figure S1C ) , in agreement with previous observations [ 4 , 22 ] . When we silenced a 2 integrins in GM95 cells , a decrease in SV40 binding was observed ( Figure 2G ) . To test if SV40 virions and integrins physically interact , we immuno - precipitated a 2 b 1 integrins from A431 cells which were incubated with SV40 for 2 hours on ice . Analysis of the immunocomplexes revealed the presence of SV40 VP1 protein ( Figure 2H ) . Transferrin immunocomplexes , on the other hand , did not contain SV40 VP1 protein ( Figure 2H ) . Together , these results provide experimental cues that integrins could serve as attachment factors of SV40 in the absence of GM1 , and that integrins and GM1 could cooperate to increase binding efficiency of SV40 in cells that express both . Cortical Actin - Membrane Uncoupling Induced by SV40 PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e55799 SV40 Activates the PI3K - AKT Pathway , which Requires Integrins but not Glycosphingolipids The list of regulators of SV40 infection also contained members of the PI3K - AKT signaling pathway , one of the major pathways regulating cell survival and growth . Silencing of the serine / threonine protein kinase AKT / PKB , and p85 ( PIK3R1 ) , the regulatory subunit 1 of the phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) reduced SV40 infection ( Figure 2A ) . Silencing of PTEN on the other hand , a phosphoinositide 3 - phosphatase and a negative regulator of this pathway , increased SV40 infection ( Figure 2A ) . Additionally , an inhibitor of PDK1 ( 3 9 - phosphoinositide - depen - dent protein kinase 1 ) , which phosphorylates AKT on Thr308 downstream of PI3K , efficiently blocked SV40 infection . An inhibitor of AKT reduced SV40 infection by app . 50 % ( Figure S2A , B ) . This prompted us to look whether SV40 induces the PI3K - AKT signaling pathway in A431 cells . Within 30 min after virus exposure , AKT became phosphorylated at Ser473 in a wortman - nin - sensitive manner , indicating that PI3K mediates this event ( Figure 3A ) . This finding is consistent with previous observations [ 25 ] . An increase in phosphorylated Tyr458 residues of p85 in the cell periphery demonstrated that PI3K is activated upon exposure to SV40 ( Figure S2C ) . The product of PI3K , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , leads to recruitment of AKT / PKB to the cell membrane [ 26 ] . Consistent with this , we observed phospho - AKT ( Ser473 ) associated with the plasma membrane upon SV40 treatment ( Figure 3B ) . This association occurred in a reversible cholesterol - dependent manner ( Figure 3B , C ) , in agreement with observations that this signaling pathway requires cholesterol [ 27 ] . Interestingly , when we treated A431 cells with the a 2 b 1 integrin antibody , we were able to induce AKT phosphorylation in a cholesterol - dependent manner even in the absence of SV40 ( Figure 3D ) . Adding SV40 to cells pre - incubated with the a 2 b 1 integrin antibody did not further increase the phosphorylation of AKT ( Figure 3D ) , suggesting that both the virus and the antibody activate AKT via a similar mechanism . Integrin - mediated phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 involves integrin - linked kinase ( ILK ) [ 28 – 30 ] , which binds to the cytoplas - mic domain of b 1 integrin . This depends on PI3K [ 31 ] , presumably to recruit AKT to the membrane in the vicinity of b 1 integrin - associated ILK . When we silenced either ILK or integrin a 2 or b 1 , SV40 was unable to increase the basal levels of Ser473 - phosphorylated AKT ( Figure 3E , F ) . Interestingly , SV40 was also able to induce AKT phosphory - lation at Ser473 in GM95 cells , demonstrating that SV40 does not require GM1 or other glycosphingolipids to activate this signaling pathway ( Figure 3G ) . However , in GM95 cells the activation of this signaling pathway could not be blocked by cholesterol Figure 1 . SV40 at its entry triggers the upregulation of a number of integrins on the cell surface . ( A ) Cell surface N - glycoproteins that are significantly altered in cell surface abundance upon exposure to SV40 are visualized with a network view . The glycoproteins whose abundance was either increased ( yellow ) or decreased ( blue ) during exposure to SV40 ( and which either did not change during exposure to VSV , or changed in the opposite direction compared to SV40 ) are depicted as nodes in the network . The different shades represent different degrees of relative abandunce ( log2 values ) . The remaining nodes in the network are the hits from the RNAi screen ( see Figure 2A ) , which either increased ( green ) or decreased ( red ) SV40 infection upon siRNA knockdown . For the common hits in the CSC and RNAi screens , the node border represents the RNAi phenotype ( ITGA6 , ITGB6 and CD47 were CSC - hits but gave no RNAi phenotype when tested ) . The grey connecting lines between nodes illustrate protein interactions , which were assessed using the STRING database with a combined score of at least 0 . 9 [ 45 ] , and were visualized using Cytoscape ( www . cytoscape . org ) and the Cerebral plugin [ 46 ] . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0055799 . g001 Cortical Actin - Membrane Uncoupling Induced by SV40 PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 3 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e55799 Figure 2 . Cell adhesion - signaling components are required for SV40 infection . Integrins , in addition to GM1 lipids , are required for SV40 binding and infection . ( A ) A targeted siRNA screen reveals several structural and signaling components of cell adhesion to regulate the SV40 infectious route . A set of four siRNAs against 263 genes was applied in A431 human epithelial cells and virus infection was assessed by the presence of nuclear large T - antigen . Low - resolution imaging and image processing with the CellProfiler analysis software were subsequently performed . A Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) - based classification method [ 47 ] was then used to determine percentage of infection upon siRNA treatment . The table Cortical Actin - Membrane Uncoupling Induced by SV40 PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 4 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e55799 depletion , in contrast to A431 cells ( Figure S2D ) . These results demonstrate that SV40 activates the PI3K - AKT signaling pathway via integrins and ILK , leading to phosphorylation of AKT at Thr308 and Ser473 . The activation of this signal does not strictly require glycosphingolipids , and is sensitive to cholesterol depletion only in cells that contain glycopshingolipids . SV40 Triggers Transient Changes in the Cortical Actin Cytoskeleton by Regulating the Phosphorylation Status of Ezrin Previous studies have shown that SV40 induces a transient reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in CV1 cells , an event dependent on plasma membrane cholesterol and protein phos - phorylation [ 5 ] . Also in A431 cells , SV40 induces a transient reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton ( Figure 4A ) . In these cells , it is visible as a loss of F - actin signal in the cell periphery , the disappearance of F - actin from filopodia - like structures , and the appearance of ruffle - like structures . The fact that Ezrin , a member of the ERM ( ezrin - radixin - moesin ) protein family , was amongst the suppressors of SV40 infection ( see Figure 2A , Figure S3A , B ) suggested that SV40 might achieve this by regulating the activity of Ezrin . ERM proteins serve as linkers between the plasma membrane and the underlying cortical actin cytoskeleton in their active phosphory - lated form , and are involved in cell adhesion , membrane ruffling and microvilli formation [ 15 , 16 ] . Using an antibody against Thr567 - phosphorylated ERM proteins ( phospho - ERM ) in A431 cells , we observed a strong signal at the cell periphery and in filopodia . Strikingly , within 5 min after exposure to SV40 , the phospho - ERM signal completely disappeared . The signal reappeared after 30 min of continuous exposure to SV40 , and was restored after one hour ( Figure 4A , B , Figure S3C ) . Inhibition of type 1 protein phosphatases drastically increased the basal levels of phosphory - lated ERM proteins , indicating that ERM proteins are constitu - tively de - phosphorylated . Inhibition of type 1 protein phosphatases also prevented SV40 from inducing de - phosphorylation of phosphor - ERM ( Figure S3D ) . A phosphomimetic mutant of Ezrin ( Ezrin - T567D - GFP ) remained localized to the cell periphery even in the presence of SV40 ( Figure 4C ) , while a non - phosphorylatable mutant , Ezrin - T567A - GFP , did not localize to the cell periphery even in the absence of SV40 ( data not shown ) . Interestingly , expression of both mutants of Ezrin potently blocked SV40 infection ( Figure 4D ) , suggesting that a full cycle of de - phosphorylation and phosphorylation is required . These observations indicate that in A431 cells , SV40 activates a signal that results in the transient de - phosphorylation of Ezrin , leading to a re - localization to the cell interior , followed by phosphorylation and reappearance on the cell surface . SV40 Induces Ezrin De - phosphorylation via PDK1 We next explored the relationship between SV40 - induced activation of the PI3K - AKT pathway and Ezrin de - phosphoryla - tion . When we inhibited PDK1 , which transmits the signal from PI3K to AKT , levels of phospho - ERM increased ( mean p - ERM intensity : control 27 . 9 % ; PDK1 inhibitor 37 . 0 % ) ( Figure 4E , F ) . Moreover , treatment of cells with SV40 in the presence of the PDK1 inhibitor failed to trigger de - phosphorylation of phospho - ERM ( p - ERM positive cells : SV40 - treated 0 % ; PDK1 inhibitor / SV40 - treated 62 . 0 % ) ( Figure 4E , F ) . As a note , in addition to Ezrin , Moesin becomes apparent as a higher mobility band on the immunoblot in the presence of the inhibitor ( Figure 4F ) . Similar results were also obtained when cells were exposed to wortmannin to block PI3K function ( data not shown ) . Notably , inhibition of AKT did not prevent SV40 from triggering de - phosphorylation of phospho - ERM ( Figure S3E ) . PDK1 , therefore , but not AKT , acts upstream in triggering Ezrin de - phosphorylation . We furthermore observed that the reduction in SV40 infection upon inhibition of PDK1 could not be rescued by additionally silencing Ezrin ( Figure 4G ) , suggesting that PDK1 plays additional roles in SV40 infection apart from enabling the de - phosphorylation of Ezrin . SV40 Induces Inactivation of RhoA via PDK1 and GRAF1 Leading to Ezrin De - phosphorylation Besides Ezrin , our screen contained RhoA as a negative regulator of SV40 infection . RhoA has been implicated in regulating the membrane crosslinking function of ERM proteins [ 15 , 32 ] . To test whether SV40 triggers de - phosphorylation of ERM proteins via RhoA , we transiently transfected A431 cells with mutant forms of RhoA . Expression of dominant - active RhoA ( RhoA - G14V ) led to increased levels of phospho - ERM , and prevented SV40 to induce a reduction of the levels of phospho - ERM ( Figure 5A ) . Expression of dominant - negative RhoA ( RhoA - T19N ) resulted in loss of phospho - ERM even in the absence of SV40 ( Figure 5A ) . Furthermore , we observed that constitutively active RhoA negatively correlated with SV40 infection , whereas inactive RhoA promoted SV40 infection in the cells it was expressed ( Figure 5B ) . Over - expression of wild - type RhoA displayed a phenotype similar to RhoA - G14V ( Figure 5B ) . These findings indicate that active RhoA keeps ERM in a phosphory - lated state , which acts as a barrier to SV40 infection ( Figure 4D ) . Moreover , they are in agreement with the fact that ruffle - like structures are observed in cells treated with SV40 ( Figure 4A ) , presumably due to activation of a small GTPAse other than RhoA . shows the genes that reduced ( red shades ) or enhanced ( green shades ) SV40 infection with different strength when knocked down . The values in the boxes represent the number of different siRNAs that gave a similar phenotype . ( B ) Epistasis analysis between Cav1 , GRAF1 , and Ezrin . A431 cells were treated with siRNA against each one of these genes or combinations of two . Two or three siRNAs were used per gene . Cells were subsequently treated with SV40 and infection levels were assessed by the presence of nuclear T - antigen . The graph shows values pooled from the individual infection indices . p - values : 1 . 3 6 10 2 4 ( Ezrin - siRNA , Cav1 - siRNA ) , 0 . 39 ( Ezrin - siRNA , GRAF1 - siRNA ) .

( D ) siRNA against integrins a 2 and b 1 reduces binding of SV40 at the surface of A431 cells .

Integrin a 2 b 1 was immunoprecipitated from A431 cells pretreated for 2 h with SV40 in the cold , and the VP1 protein was detected in the immunocomplex by immunoblotting ( red box ) . Transferrin receptor was used as a negative control . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0055799 . g002 Cortical Actin - Membrane Uncoupling Induced by SV40 PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 5 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e55799 Cortical Actin - Membrane Uncoupling Induced by SV40 PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 6 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e55799 So far , our observations indicate that PDK1 and inactive RhoA are required to induce de - phosphorylation of ERM proteins by SV40 . To connect these observations , we hypothesized that SV40 induces a signal that inactivates RhoA via PDK1 and a GTPase Activating Protein ( GAP ) , leading to a loss of phosphorylated Ezrin , which allows infection to occur . This could explain how the block in SV40 infection upon GRAF1 silencing ( Figure S4A , B ) , which is a GAP of RhoA , is rescued by additionally silencing Ezrin ( see the epistasis experiments in Figure 2B ) . Indeed , we found that in the absence of GRAF1 , SV40 cannot induce de - phosphoryla - tion of ERM proteins ( p - ERM positive cells : control 91 . 0 % ; SV40 - treated 0 % ; GRAF1 - siRNA 94 . 3 % ; GRAF1 - siRNA / SV40 - treat - ed 84 . 6 % ) ( Figure 5C ) . To test whether PDK1 and GRAF1 are required to inactivate RhoA , we analyzed levels of GTP - bound RhoA in control and SV40 - exposed A431 cell lysates . We observed that within 10 min of cell attachment , SV40 induces the partial inactivation of RhoA ( Figure 5D ) in a transient manner ( Figure S4C ) . SV40 - induced reduction of GTP - bound RhoA was abolished by the PDK1 inhibitor and by silencing GRAF1 ( Figure 5D ) . Note that silencing of GRAF1 was more than 2 - fold more efficient for siRNA2 ( Figure S4B ) , explaining its more potent effect on RhoA inactivation . Additionally , cells treated with the PDK1 inhibitor or cells silenced for GRAF1 , appeared to have less total RhoA ( Figure 5D ) . It is possible that PDK1 and GRAF1 are involved in maintaining total RhoA levels , for instance by preventing its degradation . Furthermore , we observed that over - expressing inactive RhoA ( RhoA - T19N ) was still able to reduce the number of phospho - ERM positive cells in non - virus - treated cells , even when PDK1 was inhibited or GRAF1 was silenced ( Figure 5E , F ) . This indicates that RhoA acts downstream of PDK1 and GRAF1 in phosphorylating Ezrin . These results indicate that upon SV40 engagement with integrins and activation of the PI3K - AKT pathway , RhoA becomes inactivated down - stream of PDK1 and GRAF1 , leading to a loss of phosphorylation and dissociation of Ezrin from the plasma membrane . Discussion We have here used a chemoproteomic screen in combination with an siRNA screen in order to identify and characterize signaling events induced early upon SV40 entry into host cells . The CSC technology revealed a set of modulated cell surface exposed N - glycoproteins , suggesting that a complex series of events is initiated early during attachment of the virus , which can be detected on the surfaceome level . Specifically , we could show that integrins play a role in signal transduction upon SV40 contact with the host cell , ultimately leading to activation of downstream signaling events . We also observed transient changes in the integrin a 2 b 1 expression pattern at the plasma membrane , presumably reflecting areas of clustered integrins triggered by the virus . Since several viruses use integrins to mediate attach - ment , cell entry , signaling or endosome escape [ 33 ] , similar mechanisms as the ones identified in this study might also apply to other viruses , including members of the polyoma virus family . We currently do not know whether SV40 particles bind directly to integrins , or indirectly via another protein . One possibility is that SV40 binds integrins via extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins such as collagen , since silencing of collagen aV3 impairs SV40 infection ( Figure 2A ) , and mutations in collagen genes from human fibroblasts have been shown to affect organization and clustering of a 2 b 1 integrin receptors [ 34 ] . However , collagen may also have a supportive role in signal transduction required for SV40 infectious entry . Importantly , we noticed that the glycosphingo - lipid GM1 is not strictly required for any of the aforementioned events , and cholesterol is only required for signaling in cells that produce glycosphingolipids . These findings change our view on SV40 entry significantly . They show that SV40 utilizes conven - tional forms of signal transduction by means of transmembrane proteins . Possibly , a lipid - driven mechanism of membrane invagination that relies on the clustering of lipids [ 35 , 36 ] is required after signal transduction has been initiated and the Ezrin barrier is removed . This would fit our observation that while SV40 can bind and initiate signaling in GM95 cells , it cannot infect these cells without GM1 readministration . Very early upon SV40 infectious entry , within the first 5 min of membrane attachment and engagement with integrins ( and their possible clustering ) PI3K is recruited to the membrane . This leads to the downstream phosphorylation of AKT on Ser473 and Thr308 , mediated likely by ILK and PDK1 , respectively ( Figure 6A ) . Additional signal transduction events involving phospholipase C gamma may also be involved to activate AKT [ 25 ] . This membrane - associated signal transduction cascade depends on cholesterol only in cells that produce glycosphingo - lipids . De - phosphorylation of Ezrin then becomes apparent after 10 min of exposure to SV40 , and is achieved downstream of PI3K by PDK1 and GRAF1 . PDK1 and GRAF1 are required to inactivate RhoA , inhibiting its activity to maintain phosphorylated levels of Ezrin , most likely via a downstream effector kinase ( Figure 6A ) . The Rho kinase ( ROCK ) inhibitor Y - 27632 , however , neither had an effect on levels of phosphorylated Ezrin , nor did it reduce SV40 infection ( data not shown ) , suggesting that ROCK is likely not involved in this step [ 37 ] . ERM proteins can , however , be substrates for PKC family members [ 38 , 39 ] . Within 30 min after exposure to SV40 , phosphorylated Ezrin reappears , and normal levels are re - established within 1 hour ( Figure 6A ) . Preliminary evidence suggests that the transient nature of this effect is achieved by a feedback loop between Ezrin and PI3K - AKT signaling ( not shown and Figure S3F ) . Loss and re - establishment of phosphorylated Ezrin may have several consequences : First , the loss leads to an uncoupling of the plasma membrane with the underlying cortical actin meshwork , thus mitigating a barrier for SV40 infectious entry . This is in agreement with the fact that jasplakinolide , which stabilizes the cortical actin cytoskeleton , inhibits SV40 infectious entry [ 5 ] . Figure 3 . SV40 activates the PI3K / AKT signaling at its entry in A431 and GM95 cells . ( A ) AKT is activated in a wortmannin - sensitive manner in A431 cells following SV40 treatment . A431 cells were treated with wortmannin for 1 h prior to SV40 treatment . Phosphorylated AKT at Ser473 was tested by immunoblotting . ( B , C ) Phosphorylated AKT is recruited to the plasma membrane of A431 cells in a cholesterol - dependent manner . p - AKT ( Ser473 ) was detected by immunofluorescence in fixed cells ( B ) or immunoblotting ( C ) , before or 30 min after SV40 treatment . Cholesterol was extracted from the plasma membrane using methyl - b - cyclodextrin ( m b CD ) for 45 min . Cholesterol re - administration was succeeded with cholesterol coupled to m b CD for 3 h . Scale bars in ( B ) represent 15 m m . ( D ) Incubating A431 cells with an antibody against integrin a 2 b 1 results in activation of AKT signaling . Incubation was carried out for 15 min before the addition of SV40 for another 10 min . Cholesterol extraction prior to antibody application was performed as described in ( B ) . ( E , F ) siRNA - mediated knockdown of human Integrin Linked Kinase ( ILK ) ( E ) and integrins a 2 and b 1 ( F ) leads to defective activation of AKT in A431 cells , 10 min following SV40 treatment . ( G ) AKT is phosphorylated in GM95 cells following SV40 treatment . Quantification of all western blots was done with the ImageJ software ; values represent averages of two independent experiments 6 standard deviation . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0055799 . g003 Cortical Actin - Membrane Uncoupling Induced by SV40 PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 7 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e55799 Cortical Actin - Membrane Uncoupling Induced by SV40 PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 8 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e55799 Interestingly , we observed that small blebs form on the surface of A431 cells within 10 min of exposure to SV40 ( Figure S5A , Movie S1 ) , a well - known consequence of Ezrin de - phosphorylation [ 40 ] . Indeed over - expressing a phospho - mimetic mutant of Ezrin severely compromised the formation of blebs in SV40 - exposed cells ( Figure S5A ) . Treating SV40 - exposed cells with blebbistatin , which inhibits Myosin II and bleb retraction [ 40 ] , led to the formation of enlarged blebs , and somewhat reduced SV40 infection ( Figure S5A , B ) . Second , we observed that over - expression of phospho - mimetic Ezrin reduces the dynamics of GFP - tagged caveolin - 1 ( Figure S5C ) . This suggests that SV40 activates caveolae dynamics by inducing Ezrin de - phosphorylation in cells expressing caveolin - 1 [ 7 , 41 ] . Third , we found that energy depletion , known to induce membrane tubulation , leads to a complete loss of phosphorylated Ezrin ( Figure S5D , E ) , suggesting that SV40 activates this signaling pathway to promote membrane tubule formation [ 8 ] . Interestingly , although caveolin - 1 is essential for SV40 infection in A431 cells , we found it not to be required for the SV40 - induced signaling events described here ( not shown ) , in agreement with the fact that inhibition of SV40 infection by silencing caveolin - 1 cannot be rescued by additionally silencing Ezrin ( see Figure 2B ) . We neither expect it to be strictly required for virus uptake , since SV40 particles can internalize in caveolin - deficient cells [ 42 ] , and can be seen in GRAF1 - positive intracellular structures in A431 cells ( see Figure S4E ) . An interesting hypothesis that emerges is that bleb formation , induced by SV40 , may depend on caveolae , as caveolae can serve as buffers of plasma membrane [ 43 ] and their local disassembly may be required for the expansion of plasma membrane during bleb formation . In such a scenario , the signaling pathway activated by SV40 could lead to destabilization of the caveolar coat , which is consistent with our previous findings that SV40 induces the mixing of preassembled caveolar coats [ 41 ] . Further work will be required to investigate the role of caveolae in SV40 - induced membrane blebbing . We extensively used phosphorylation of AKT as readout to study the activation of signaling by SV40 . However , the actual role of AKT in this network is still elusive . We speculate that it could participate in regulating the endocytic machinery that the virus uses , or is activated by SV40 to maintain pro - survival signals during later stages of infection [ 25 ] . The fact that we observe high levels of phosphorylated AKT even after 8 hours of SV40 exposure ( not shown ) supports the latter . Furthermore , besides Ezrin , we cannot exclude that the other ERM proteins Radixin and Moesin play a role in SV40 - induced uncoupling of cortical actin and the plasma membrane . Finally , the interaction between PDK1 and GRAF1 , and possibly additional kinases [ 44 ] in this signaling pathway require further study . Combining detailed high - resolution time - lapse imaging with quantitative image analysis of the various molecular players mentioned here , will be necessary to unravel the timing of the here - described signaling pathway and its connection with membrane blebbing and membrane tubulation .

Cells were washed twice , scraped in a total volume of 20 mL hypotonic buffer ( 10 mM Tris HCl , pH7 . 5 , and 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 ) incubated on ice for 10 min , and homogenized with 40 strokes in a tight - fitting Dounce homogenizer . The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged in a SW41 rotor ( Beckman ) at 35 , 000 rpm for 1 h . Membrane pellets were resuspended and recentrifuged to remove cytoplasmic contamination . Subsequent steps of dissolving in Rapigest , digesting with trypsin , binding to streptavidin beads , washing at high ionic strength , and eluting bound N - glycosylated peptides with protein N - glycosidase F were performed as previously described [ 10 , 11 ] . Samples were analyzed using a Finnigan LTQ - FT ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) mass spectrometer . Peptide identification was performed using the X ! Tandem search engine ( Version 4 . 4 . 0 ) in combination with PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet software [ 11 ] . The relative abundance of the two samples was determined via the XPRESS tool as part of the Trans proteomic pipeline ( TPP ; version 3 . 2 ) [ 48 ] . Proteins that were identified by at least one N - glycosylated peptide with a probability cutoff of 0 . 8 ( error rate 0 . 016 ) , in two or three independent experiments were included in the analysis . The ratios ( relative abundance ) for all proteins were calculated and used to normalize the results , which are shown as log2 ratios . and compared with the expected number emerging from a random occurrence of the two signals .

Cells were reverse transfected with the respective siRNAs in 96 - well , 24 - well plates or in LabTek chambers . Five , 15 or 7 . 5 pmol siRNA , respectively , diluted in Opti - MEM and mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) were transferred into each well . Cells were seeded on top of the siRNA and incubated for 3 days . For the double siRNA knockdown , 2 . 5 pmol of each siRNA were used in 96 - well plates . For the candidate - based RNAi screen in A431 cells , 2 . 5 pmol of four different siRNAs were used to silence each one of 263 genes in 384 - well plates . Cells were then infected with SV40 for 22 h , fixed with para - formaldehyde , stained for the presence of large T - antigen , and subsequently imaged with a 10 6 objective ( cell - WoRx , Cellomics ) . Images were processed with the CellProfiler image analysis software [ 49 ] . After nuclei and cell segmentation , based on DAPI and plasma membrane staining , respectively , 133 features including shape , intensity and texture were measured from each object . Those features were used to train a Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) - based classifier in an iterative manner [ 47 ] . Out - of - focus and poorly segmented cells were discarded from the analysis . We used a binary classification approach ( infection , no infection ) and defined the SV40 infection index as the number of cells with infected nuclei divided by the total number of cells in the well . We defined a lower and an upper threshold according to the infection index of control siRNA - treated cells , and obtained a list with roughly 20 positive and negative regulators of SV40 infection .

All sequences were cloned into pcDNA5 vector carrying GFP or mCherry C - terminally , using standard cloning protocol procedures . Cells were transiently transfected with the plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitro - gen , Carlsbad , CA ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and were used for analysis 16 – 20 h later . Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy Cells were grown on 12 mm coverslips until the appropriate assay was performed .

The cells were subsequently harvested for immunoblotting analysis or fixed for immunofluorescence analysis . Integrin Immunoprecipitation For the IP experiment cells were incubated with SV40 at cold for 2 h . Cells were then lysed with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris - HCL pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 1 % Na deoxycholate and protease inhibitors mix . For 300 – 500 m L protein extract , 1 – 2 m g of integrin a 2 b 1 antibody ( abcam , clone P1E6 ) were used to immunoprecipate integrins and the immuno - complex was captured with protein G sepharose beads ( GE Healthcare , 17 - 0618 - 01 ) . The immunocomplex was then dissoci - ated from the beads with heating and loaded onto an SDS PAGE gel . SV40 was detected on the blot using an antibody against the VP1 protein ( abcam , ab53977 ) . Immunoprecipitation of the transferrin receptor was used as a negative control for SV40 binding . RhoA Activity Assay Activated RhoA was measured by immunoprecipitating the RhoA - GTP fraction from whole protein cell lysates using Rhotekin RBD agarose beads ( Millipore , 14 – 383 ) . Cells were grown on 24 - well plates and were either treated with the PDK1 inhibitor or wortmannin for 1 . 5 h , or were treated with siRNA against GRAF1 for 3 days . SV40 was added to the cells for the indicated time points . Alternatively , a timecourse of SV40 exposure onto untreated cells was performed . Cells were lysed using Mg 2 + lysis buffer ( 25 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Igepal CA - 630 , 10 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EDTA and 2 % glycerol ) and incubated with the agarose beads according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Levels of RhoA - GTP were quantified with immunoblotting using a RhoA antibody ( Santa Cruz , clone 26C4 ) . An aliquot was kept before the Rhotekin RBD binding to assess total levels of RhoA . Tubulin was used as a loading control and to normalize RhoA protein amounts . Image Analysis Image analysis of the assays performed in 96 - well plates was carried out with the CellProfiler open - source image analysis software [ 49 ] . Confocal microscope images as well as Western blots quantifications were analyzed using ImageJ and Photoshop CS3 . Cholesterol Extraction and Cholesterol / GM1 Readministration Cholesterol was extracted from cells using 10 mM m b CD in SFM for 1 h . For the readministration experiments , cells were incubated in SFM supplemented with 15 m g / ml cholesterol complexed to 0 . 37 mM m b CD for 3 h at 37 u C . For the SV40 rescuing experiment in GM95 cells , 2 . 3 , 4 . 6 , 9 . 2 or 13 . 8 m M GM1 Cortical Actin - Membrane Uncoupling Induced by SV40 PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 12 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e55799 complexed to fatty acid - free BSA was applied for 12 h onto cells . Incubation with SV40 followed in R - medium devoid of GM1 . Relative Quantification of Transcripts Cells grown in a monolayer and treated with siRNAs against Ezrin and GRAF1 were washed twice with PBS and harvested by adding 200 m L of Trizol reagent ( Invitrogen ) per well in a 24 - well plate . Total RNA extraction was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol and reverse transcription was performed using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit ( Qiagen ) . Quantitative real - time RT - PCR was carried out in an Mx3005P QPCR System ( Stratagene ) using the following primers : Ezrin forward 5 9 - CTGCAGGACTATGAGGAGAAGAC - 3 9 , Ezrin reverse 5 9 - AGCCATACGGTCAGCCTCTAG - 3 9 , GRAF1 for - ward 5 9 - GCTTTGATGTGG AAGCAGTAGAC - 3 9 , GRAF1 reverse 5 9 - TTCACTCTGGCT GTCTTTGTTCG - 3 9 , GAPDH forward 5 9 - TCAAGGCTGAGAACGGGAAGCTTG - 3 9 and GAPDH reverse 5 9 - AGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGAC - 3 9 . Average fold change was calculated using GAPDH as an internal standard . FRAP Analysis For FRAP experiments , A431 - Cav1 - GFP cells were grown on LabTek chamber slides and transfected with 0 . 4 m g of wild - type Ezrin - or Ezrin - T567A / T567D - mCherry using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . SV40 was applied onto cells for 15 – 45 min prior to analysis . A defined region was bleached at full laser power ( 100 % power , 100 % transmission , 20 iterations ) using the 488 nm line from a 30 mW Argon / 2 laser . Recovery of fluorescence was monitored by scanning the region above at low laser power ( 50 % power , 3 % transmission ) and by acquiring images every 2 . 5 sec . Images were processed using Image J ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) . Quantification of FRAP experiments was performed by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the whole cell and of the bleached region before , directly after , and during recovery upon bleaching . Relative intensity of fluorescence ( RI ) was calculated according to the following equation : RI = ( Itotal [ 0 ] / Ibleached [ 0 ] ) 6 ( Ibleached [ t ] / Itotal [ t ] ) , where Ito - tal [ 0 ] is the total intensity of the cell before bleaching , I bleached [ 0 ] the total intensity of the bleached region before bleaching , Ibleached [ t ] Ibleached [ t ] the intensity of the bleached region at time t , and Itotal [ t ] the intensity of the whole cell at time t .

GRAF1 was knocked down in A431 cells with two different siRNAs and SV40 infection was assessed by the presence of nuclear large T - antigen ( p - value 4 . 9 6 10 2 3 and 8 . 7 6 10 2 4 for siRNA1 and siRNA2 , respectively ) . ( B ) Efficiency of siRNA - mediated knockdown of GRAF1 in A431 cells . Remaining mRNA levels from siRNA - treated cells were measured with qRT - PCR and results were expressed as fold - downregulation compared to untreated samples . ( C ) RhoA is transiently inacti - vated after SV40 treatment . Cells exposed to SV40 for the indicated time points were subjected to RhoA - GTP immunopre - cipitation , which was subsequently detected with a RhoA antibody using immunoblotting . The graph shows the quantification of the RhoA - GTP signal normalized against tubulin . Note the differenc - es in the loading control , to which RhoA - GTP intensity is Cortical Actin - Membrane Uncoupling Induced by SV40 PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 13 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e55799 normalized . ( D ) GRAF1 can be localized in vesicular or tubular structures in CV1 cells . Cells were transfected with a GFP - GRAF1 construct , fixed and imaged with confocal microscopy for the GFP signal localization . Dapi - stained nuclei are shown in blue . Depicted are two examples of untreated cells visible in a population . Scale bars represent 10 m m . ( E ) SV40 can partition in GRAF1 - positive vesicles . A431 cells were transfected with GFP - GRAF1 and subsequently exposed to fluorescently - labeled SV40 ( AF568 - SV40 ) for 1 h at 37 u C . Fixed cells were then tested for the localization of the virus within GRAF1 - positive structures . The arrowhead points to a tubule that also contains SV40 particles . Scale bars represent 15 m m . ( TIF ) Figure S5 Consequences of loss and re - establishment of phosphorylated Ezrin . ( A ) SV40 induces membrane blebbing dependent on Ezrin inactivation . A431 cells were transfected with the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 membrane marker , PH ( PLC d ) - GFP , and further incubated with SV40 . Live cell imaging was performed during the first 10 min of virus treatment . Addition of 100 m M blebbistatin for 45 min prior to SV40 treatment captured blebs at their expanded phase , whereas co - expression of EzrinT567D - mCherry prevented formation of blebs . ( B ) Treatment of A431 cells with 100 m M blebbistatin for 2 h prior to SV40 treatment reduces infection by 50 % ( p - value 0 . 003 ) . ( C ) Phosphomimetic Ezrin ( T567D ) strongly reduces the dynamics of Cav1 - GFP , while the non - phosphorylatable mutant ( T567A ) shows no effect . A Cav1 - GFP - expressing A431 cell line was transfected with EzrinT567D - mCherry or EzrinT567A - mCherry and FRAP analysis was used to monitor exchange between cell surface and intracellular pools of caveolae . Expression of phosphomimetic Ezrin greatly reduces Cav1 - GFP dynamics . ( D ) A431 cells were energy - depleted for 30 min using NaN 3 [ 8 ] , fixed and assessed for p - ERM ( T567 ) signal using immunofluorescence . ( E ) Protein extracts of A431 cells following energy depletion were subjected to immunoblotting against p - AKT ( Ser473 ) and p - ERM ( T567 ) . Energy depletion leads to complete loss of p - ERM , and loss of p ( Ser473 ) AKT . ( TIF ) Table S1 Cell surface proteins regulated by SV40 and VSV .
